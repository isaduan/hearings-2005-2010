Small Business Innovation

Research Reauthorization on
the 25th Program Anniversary

THURSDAY, APRIL 26, 2007

1:00 P.M.–3:00 P.M.

2325 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Thursday,  April  26,  the  Subcommittee  on  Technology  and  Innovation  of  the
Committee on Science and Technology will hold a hearing to review the Small Busi-
ness Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program
(STTR) programs.
2. Witnesses
Mr.  Bruce  J.  Held  is  the  Director  of  the  Force  Development  and  Technology  Pro-
gram at the RAND Arroyo Center, The RAND Corporation.
Mr.  Jon  Baron  is  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Coalition  for  Evidence-Based  Pol-
icy, a program of the Council for Excellence in Government.
Mr.  Robert  N.  Schmidt  is  Founder  and  Chairman  of  Cleveland  Medical  Devices
Inc, and Orbital Research Inc.
Dr.  Gary  McGarrity  is  Executive  Vice  President  of  Scientific  and  Clinical  Affairs
of VIRxSYS Corporation.
Mr. Anthony R. Ignagni is President and CEO of Synapse Biomedical Inc.

3. Hearing Issues

• Program  Effectiveness:  Are  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  meeting  pro-
gram objectives to stimulate and commercialize innovation in support of agen-
cy missions through expanded small business participation in extramural fed-
eral R&D? How could program efficiency and effectiveness be improved? Does
flexibility  in  program  administration  contribute  to  the  program  effectiveness
across agencies with diverse missions?

• Award  Levels.  What  are  the  appropriate  award  levels  in  light  of  typical
project  costs  to  support  agency  missions,  the  trends  in  seed  and  early  stage
financing, and the fact that there has not been an inflationary adjustment in
award levels since 1992?

• Small Business Participation. How  can  the  programs  increase  the  partici-
pation  of  innovative  small  businesses  in  federal  R&D—the  total  number  of
small businesses, the geographic distribution, and the participation of minor-
ity and disadvantaged firms?

• Financing  and  Commercialization.  What  common  program  elements  are
needed  across  all  agencies  to  address  financing  gaps  in  the  Phased  award
structure,  to  encourage  private  equity  participation,  provide  commercializa-
tion  assistance,  and  increase  small  business’s  share  of  federal  procurement
and non-SBIR/STTR federal R&D?

• Administrative  Costs.  How  should  program  administration  costs  be  ad-
dressed  in  reauthorization?  Today,  costs  are  paid  out  of  non-SBIR/STTR  pro-
gram funds.

• Venture Capital Majority Ownership. Should  small  businesses  be  able  to
participate  in  the  SBIR/STTR  programs  if  multiple  venture  firms  hold  some

ownership  of  the  firm  at  the  time  of  grant  award  and  together  hold  majority
ownership?  How  would  this  incrementally  support  agency  missions  and
project  commercialization?  Would  VCs  provide  additional  project  funding  be-
yond SBIR awards and commercialization assistance? Is NIH the only agency
that  requires  this  flexibility  to  address  the  funding  requirements  of  the  bio-
technology industry?

4. Background—The SBIR/STTR Programs

SBIR was established in 1982 by the Small Business Innovation Development Act
[P.L. 97–219] to increase the participation of small, high technology firms in federal
research  and  development  (R&D)  activities.  The  Act  outlined  four  broad  congres-
sional goals:

• To stimulate technological innovation
• To use small business to meet federal R&D needs
• To foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons

• To  increase  the  private  sector  commercialization  of  innovations  derived  from

in technological innovation

federal R&D.

SBIR has been reauthorized twice in 19921 and 2000, with authorization extended

through September 30, 2008.

Small  businesses  are  eligible  for  SBIR  awards  if  they  are  independently  owned
and  operated  for-profit  companies,  not  dominant  in  the  field  of  research  proposed,
and employ fewer than 500 people.

Under SBIR, departments and agencies with extramural RDT&E budgets of $100
million  or  more  are  required  to  set  aside  2.5  percent  of  these  budgets  to  sponsor
research  at  small  companies  through  the  SBIR  program.  The  award  competition  is
peer reviewed and highly competitive with only 15–20 percent of Phase I (feasibility)
stage applicants winning awards. Awards are based on scientific, technical and com-
mercial merit.

Currently,  11  departments  and  agencies  sponsor  SBIR  programs:  the  Depart-
ments of Defense (DOD), Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Hous-
ing  and  Urban  Development,  Homeland  Security,  Transportation,  Energy,  and  the
Environmental  Protection  Agency,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administra-
tion,  and  the  National  Science  Foundation.  DOD,  HHS/NIH,  DOE,  NASA  &  NSF
accounted  for  96  percent  of  SBIR  program  awards  in  FY05  (DOD  and  HHS/NIH
alone, 81 percent).

Each  agency  runs  its  own  SBIR  program,  emphasizing  research  areas  supporting
the mission of the particular agency. There is a great deal of diversity between pro-
grams  and  even  within  organizations  of  an  agency.  For  example,  DOD  has  10  par-
ticipating  components  making  SBIR  awards,  and  the  individual  programs  differ  in
how  topics  are  selected  and  commercialization  assistance  offered.  DOD  and  NASA,
in  particular,  integrate  award  winners  into  their  procurement  processes.  But  SBA
is  supposed  to  establish  broad  policy  guidelines  for  the  SBIR  program.  SBA  mon-
itors  program  implementation  and  reports  award  statistics  to  Congress  including
minority and disadvantaged participation.

From  its  inception  in  1982  to  2005,  over  $18.9  billion  in  SBIR  awards  have  been
made for more than 88,800 research projects. In fiscal year 2005, SBIR made 6,171
awards, totaling $1.86 billion.

The  SBIR  program  is  divided  into  three  phases.  Phase  I  awards  (up  to  $100,000)
fund  research  projects  designed  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  and  the  scientific  and
technical merit of an idea. Phase II awards (up to $750,000) provide additional fund-
ing  for  Phase  I  projects  that  have  demonstrated  potential  for  successful  develop-
ment.  Funding  covers  further  development  to  the  prototype  stage.  Companies  are
expected to leverage SBIR funding to obtain private or non-SBIR government fund-
ing to turn the prototype developed in Phase II into a commercial product or service
for  sale  to  government  and  private  sector  customers  in  Phase  III.  No  SIBR  funds
support  Phase  III.  Phases  I  and  II  proposals  are  evaluated  on  the  scientific  and
technical merit of the proposed research, the qualification of key personnel, and the
potential for transition into a commercial product.

1 In 1992, Congress expanded the purposes to include to ‘‘emphasize the program’s goal of in-
creasing  private  sector  commercialization  developed  through  federal  research  and  development
and  to  improve  the  Federal  Government’s  dissemination  of  information  concerning  the  small
business innovation, particularly with regard to women-owned business concerns and by socially
and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.’’

STTR  was  established  in  1992  by  the  Small  Business  Research  and  Development
Enhancement  Act  (P.L.  102–564)  and  reauthorized  again  in  1997  and  in  2001
through September 2009. It funds cooperative R&D conducted jointly by small busi-
nesses  and  research  institutions  (universities,  federally  funded  R&D  centers
(FFRDCs)  or  domestic  nonprofit  research  organizations).  Like  SBIR,  the  research
must support the mission of the funding agency. For STTR the set aside is 0.3 per-
cent  for  departments  that  spend  over  $1  billion  per  year  in  extramural  R&D.  The
Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, NASA and NSF par-
ticipate  in  the  STTR  program.  In  FY  2005,  there  were  832  STTR  awards  totaling
$220.3 million.
History of SBIR Program

The SBIR program was designed to enable innovative small businesses engage in
high-risk  research  and  development  to  compete  successfully  with  large  firms  and
universities  for  federal  R&D  grants  and  contracts.  Small  companies  are  at  a  dis-
advantage in spite of their great potential to contribute to the Nation’s science base.
They are also a major source of new jobs. STTR extends the principal to cooperative
research with research organization such as universities and federal labs.

In  2001,  the  most  recent  reauthorization  of  SBIR,  the  Small  Business  Reauthor-
ization Act [P.L. 106–554] required a study by the National Research Council (NRC)
to  review  of  the  performance  of  the  five  largest  SBIR  programs  and  semiannual
progress  reports  to  the  Committee  on  Science  and  the  House  and  Senate  Commit-
tees on Small Business.2 To date, the NRC has published three reports3, but results
of  the  individual  agency  SBIR  program  assessments  and  study  findings  and  rec-
ommendations have not been released.

The  Act  also  required  SBA  to  establish  databases  of  SBIR  activity  to  help  track
and  assess  the  performance  of  the  SBIR  program,  and  encouraged  SBIR  agencies
to do a better job of partnering with states via the creation of the Federal and State
Technology Partnership (FAST) program and Rural Outreach Program (ROP). FAST
is  a  competitive  grants  program  that  allows  each  state  to  receive  funding  in  the
form  of  a  grant  to  provide  services  to  promote  participation  in  the  SBIR  program.
ROP  provides  federal  assistance  to  support  statewide  outreach  to  small  high-tech
business located in 25 states that are under-represented in SBIR/STTR awards.

Effective,  January  3,  20054,  the  SBA  revised  its  eligibility  criteria  for  SBIR  to
allow  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  to  participate,  providing  its  parent  company,  with
all its affiliates, still meets the eligibility criteria.

The  SBA  policy  directive  requires  owners  of  the  SBIR/STTR  participant  be  ‘‘indi-
viduals’’  who  are  ‘‘citizens  of,  or  permanent  resident  aliens  in  the  United  States.’’
The  regulations  do  not  provide  that  corporations  or  other  artificial  entities  may
qualify as ‘‘individuals.’’

Other  legislative  and  executive  branch  actions  have  shaped  the  SBIR/STTP  pro-
gram.  Section  252  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA)  of  FY  2006
[P.L.  109–163]  contains  elements  to  strengthen  the  SBIR  program  in  DOD,  includ-
ing a stronger focus on cutting-edge R&D, on SBIR Phase III prime contracting and
subcontracting  opportunities  through  creation  of  a  Commercialization  Pilot  Pro-
gram, and on small high-tech manufacturing by adopting into law, Executive Order
13329,  Encouraging  Innovation  in  Manufacturing.  E.O.  13329  (February  24,  2004)
encouraged federal agencies to assist the private sector in its manufacturing innova-
tion efforts through the SBIR and STTR programs.
5. Background—Hearing Issues
Program  Effectiveness.  Section  1085 of  the  Small  Business  Reauthorization  Act
of  2000  mandated  the  National  Research  Council  ‘‘conduct  a  comprehensive  study

2 Sec, 108. National Research Council Reports.
3 The  three  reports  are:  Program  Diversity  and  Assessment  Challenge,  Project  Methodology,

and Phase III Challenge of Commercialization.

4 December 3, 2004, 13CFR121.702
5 Sec.108(a)(1)  says  the  comprehensive  study  should  include:  ‘‘(A)  a  review  of  the  value
of  the  federal  research  agencies  of  the  research  projects  being  conducted  under  the  SBIR  pro-
gram,  and  of  the  quality  of  research  being  conducted  by  small  businesses  participating  under
the  program,  including  comparison  of  the  value  of  projects  conducted  under  the  SBIR  program

of  how  the  SBIR  program  has  stimulated  technological  innovation  and  uses  small
businesses to meet federal research and development needs.’’ In addition, DOD com-
missioned  the  RAND  Corporation  to  evaluate  and  make  recommendations  to  im-
prove the DOD SBIR program. The results of this report are the subject of the testi-
mony by Bruce Held.
Award  Levels.  The  financing  gap  for  seed  and  early  stage  firms,  the  ‘‘valley  of
death,’’  is  still  a  looming  business  risk  as  venture  capital  firms  raise  the  floor  of
their investments to several million dollars and focus on investment in business ex-
pansion rather than the most risky stages of innovative firms.
Small  Business  Participation.  Outreach  programs  play  a  vital  role  to  insure
broad  geographic  distribution  of  awards  and  the  participation  of  minority  and  dis-
advantaged firms. But, support has not been included in the administration budgets
since FY05 for the SBA Federal and State Technology Partnership (FAST) program
and Rural Outreach Program (ROP).

Participation could broadly be increased by raising the set-aside above the current
2.5  percent  for  SBIR.  The  initial  set-aside  in  1982  was  1.25  percent  of  extramural
R&D.  That  was  increased  to  1.5  percent  in  1992  and  2.5  percent  in  2000.  There
have  already  been  significant  increases  in  SBIR  funding  in  the  last  eight  years  as
a  result  of  the  doubling  of  NIH  budget  between  FY  1999  to  FY  2003,  and  the  rise
in defense spending since 2001. In addition, the Administration’s ACI proposal dou-
bles  a  portion  of  NSF,  DOE  and  NIST’s  budget  with  associated  increases  in  SBIR
program funds.
Financing  and  Commercialization.  As  the  NRC  notes  in  their  study  of  SBIR,
‘‘Commercializing  SBIR  supported  innovation  is  necessary  if  the  Nation  is  to  cap-
italize  on  its  SBIR  investments.  This  transition  is,  however,  challenging  because  it
requires  a  small  firm  with  an  innovative  idea  to  evolve  quickly  from  a  narrow
focus  on  R&D  to  a  much  broader  understanding  of  the  complex  systems  and  mis-
sions of federal agencies as well as the interrelated challenges of managing a larger
business, developing sources of finance, and competing in the marketplace.’’ 6

Since  no  SBIR/STTR  funds  support  Phase  III,  firms  must  begin  early  in  Phase
II to plan to cross the ‘‘valley of death’’ where the lack of sufficient funds and com-
mercialization assistance can easily trap a firm. To assist, federal agencies have de-
veloped innovative policies to help SBIR and STTP firms address financing gaps in-
herent in the award cycles, provide incentives to attract third party funds in Phase
II and III, to match or showcase SBIR technologies with private companies and gov-
ernment  agencies,  and  encourage  insertion  of  SBIR  developed  technologies  into
agency procurement programs.
Administrative Costs. Existing  law  prohibits  the  use  of  SBIR  and  STTR  funds  to
cover  the  program’s  administrative  costs,  including  commercialization  assistance,
technical assistance beyond $4000 per phase, program evaluation, and salaries. This
forces  the  agencies  to  pay  for  these  costs  out  of  non-SBIR/STTR  program  funds.
These administrative costs can be critical to program effectiveness.
Venture  Capital  Majority  Ownership.  There  is  a  sharp  debate  in  the  research
and  venture  capital  communities  on  whether  it  is  appropriate  for  SBIR  awards  to
be given to small businesses that are majority-owned by venture capital (VC) firms.
SBIR is very attractive to entrepreneurs because the awards are either grants or
contracts  and  do  not  dilute  company  ownership.  Moreover,  companies  retain  rights
to technical data for a four year non-disclosure period following each award. The ap-
peal of SBIR awards extends to private capital when they evaluate investments. An
SBIR  award  provides  the  firm  an  imprimatur  (a  certificate  or  mark  of  official  ap-

to small businesses with such allocation for fiscal year 1983, and an analysis of the factors that
contributed to such allocation; and (E) an analysis of whether federal agencies, in fulfilling their
procurement  needs,  are  making  sufficient  effort  to  use  small  businesses  that  have  completed  a
second phase award under the SBIR program.’’

Sec.  108(a)(2)  further  requires  NRC  ‘‘make  recommendations  with  respect  to—(A)  meas-
ures  of  outcomes  for  strategic  plans  submitted. . .of  each  federal  agency  participating  in  the
SBIR  program;  (B)  whether  companies  who  can  demonstrate  project  feasibility,  but  who  have
not received a first phase award, should be eligible for second phase awards on the competitive
selection  process  of  the  program;  (C)  whether  the  Federal  Government  should  be  permitted  to
recoup some or all of its expenses if a controlling interest in a company receiving an SBIR award
is  sold  to  a  foreign  company  or  to  a  company  that  is  not  a  small  business  concern;  (D)  how  to
increase  the  use  by  the  Federal  Government  in  its  programs  and  procurements  of  technology-
oriented  small  businesses;  and  (E)  improvements  to  the  SBIR  program,  if  any  are  considered
appropriate.’’ (emphasis added)

proval through the peer review process) as an innovative firm, reducing the due dili-
gence required by private investors.

Proponents  of  changing  the  current  rule  argue  that  VC  firms  are  a  major  source
of  financing  and  that  VC  support  can  help  a  firm  continue  research  and  commer-
cialize  products  beyond  the  start  with  SBIR  funding.  Opponents  contend  that  VC
firms  control  small  business  firms  through  the  protective  covenants  of  their  invest-
ments. Therefore, opponents argue, small businesses that are controlled by VC firms
are not independent small businesses in need of special research funding and do not
merit SBIR support.
Why Now? The current dispute over VC funding began in 2001, when the SBA Of-
fice of Hearings and Appeals issued a ruling against the majority ownership of SBIR
companies  by  VC  firms  in  response  to  an  appeal  of  a  rejection  of  SBIR  funding  by
NIH  based  upon  majority  VC  ownership.7 The  ruling  made  by  the  Administrative
Law Judge stated that VC firms were not ‘‘individuals,’’ i.e., ‘‘natural persons,’’ and
therefore SBIR agencies could not give SBIR grants to companies in which VC firms
had  a  controlling  interest.  BIO  and  NVCA  claimed  this  was  a  new  interpretation
of the VC-small business relationship, but SBA said it was simply a clarification and
enforcement  of  eligibility  standards.  VCs  can  take  majority  ownership  after  an
award is made but the firm would thereafter be denied further awards or enhance-
ments.
Advocates for Expanded VC Participation in SBIR-eligible Companies

The  biotechnology  industry  is  the  strongest  advocate  for  unrestricted  VC  affili-
ation  with  SBIR-funded  companies.  Advocates  argue  that  the  SBA  rule  at  best  cre-
ates a meaningless barrier to private-sector investment that inhibits growth of bud-
ding companies, and at worst blocks the translation of new discoveries into life-sav-
ing  products  for  numerous  fatal  diseases.  They  point  out  that  biotechnology  R&D
is  capital-intensive  and  the  involvement  of  VC  money  is  critical  to  bring  drugs
through  the  development  phase  to  market.  BIO  and  NVCA  have  taken  the  official
position that eligibility for SBIR awards should be expanded to include small compa-
nies that are majority owned by a consortium of VC firms.
Advocates for Limited VC Participation in SBIR

However,  the  biotechnology  industry  is  not  entirely  united  in  its  opposition  to
SBA’s  policy.  Some  biotechnology  experts  and  company  representatives  argue  that,
if  SBA  regulations  allowed  more  VC-backed  companies  to  apply  for  SBIR  grants,
they  would  crowd  out  completely  independent  small  research  companies  run  or
owned  by  individuals  who  focus  on  opportunities  that  do  not  match  VC  investment
criteria  (e.g.,  more  niche  markets  but  are  nonetheless  medical  needs).  They  also
point  out  that  SBIR-eligible  companies  are  currently  able  to  attract  VC  backing
without  giving  away  a  majority  stake,  and  therefore  it  is  not  necessary  to  expand
the role of VC.

Beyond the biotechnology industry, some companies and small business advocates
point  out  that  many  large  companies,  such  as  Intel,  have  set  up  VC  funds  as  a
means of investing in, and ultimately buying promising new companies that develop
breakthrough technologies. They argue that if the Federal Government funded small
businesses  backed  by  such  VC  funds,  the  SBIR  program  could  end  up  subsidizing
the acquisition of small businesses by big businesses. This, for example, is the posi-
tion held by the Small Business Technology Coalition (SBTC), for example.

Chairman  WU.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  afternoon’s
hearing  of  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee  on  Small
Business  Innovative  Research  Authorization.  This  year  represents
significant  milestones  in  the  history  of  SBIR  as  well  as  the  Small
Business Technology Transfer Program. July 22nd will be the 25th
anniversary  of  SBIR,  and  October  28  will  be  the  15th  anniversary
of  STTR.  Indeed,  one  of  our  witnesses,  Mr.  Baron,  was  counsel  on
the House Committee on Small Business where he led the effort to
secure  enactment  of  legislation  establishing  the  STTR  program  in
1992.

SBIR  is  a  highly  competitive  program  that  encourages  small
businesses  to  explore  and  develop  innovative,  high-risk  technical
projects.  By  including  qualified  small  businesses  in  the  federal
R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated, strengthening U.S.
innovation and competitiveness.

SBIR  and  STTR  were  last  authorized  in  2000  and  2001  respec-
tively.  Today  we  invite  our  witnesses  to  address  the  overall  effec-
tiveness  and  efficiency  of  these  programs  in  the  intervening  years
and to recommend changes to improve the programs.

In addition, we have invited federal agencies with both SBIR and
STTR  Programs  to  submit  written  statements  for  the  record  with
the same objective.

I would like to highlight a few key issues we will consider today.
First,  award  levels.  Should  award  levels  be  larger  for  Phase  I  and
Phase II? The ‘‘Valley of Death’’ for seed and early stage companies
persists as venture capital firms continue to raise their level of in-
vestment  and  focus  on  mid-  and  later-term  stage  investments
where there is less financial and technical risk. Moreover, the SBIR
award levels have not been adjusted since 1992.

Second,  small  business  participation.  How  do  we  broaden  the
participation  of  minority  and  disadvantaged  firms  as  well  as  ex-
pand  the  regional  participation  of  innovative  small  businesses  and
federal R&D?

Third,  financing  and  commercialization.  Agencies  are  currently
prohibited  from  using  SBIR  program  funds  to  support  administra-
tive  costs.  Would  permitting  the  use  of  a  percentage  of  SBIR  pro-
gram funds for technical and commercialization assistance and on-
going program evaluation improve commercialization rates?

Finally,  participation  of  venture  capital.  There  has  been  debate
about SBIR eligibility standards and the program impact of permit-
ting awards to firms when multiple venture capital firms own ma-
jority ownership of the firm.

All  of  these  issues  are  on  the  table  today  for  comment  and  dis-
cussion  with  our  witnesses.  We  look  forward  to  hearing  your
thoughts on how to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of
these programs.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

I want to welcome everyone to this afternoon’s hearing of the Technology and In-
novation  Subcommittee  on  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (or  SBIR)  Author-
ization.

This  year  represents  significant  milestones  in  the  history  of  SBIR  as  well  as  the

Indeed,  one  of  our  witnesses,  Mr.  Baron,  was  counsel  on  the  House  Committee  on
Small  Business  where  he  led  the  effort  to  secure  enactment  of  legislation  estab-
lishing the STTR program in 1992.

Chairman  WU.  Now,  I  would  like  to  welcome  my  friend  and  col-
league,  the  Ranking  Member  of  this  subcommittee  from  Georgia,
Dr. Gingrey for his opening remarks.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  afternoon,  every-
body,  and  I  want  to  thank  all  of  your  for  attending,  especially  our
five  witnesses  for  this  hearing  on  the  Technology  and  Innovation
Subcommittee of the Science Committee.

Today  we  will  be  looking,  as  the  Chairman  said,  at  the  Small
Business  Innovation  Research  Program  as  it  goes  forward  in  this,
its  25th  silver  anniversary.  This  hearing  precedes  the  Subcommit-
tee’s markup of reauthorization language, hopefully some time this
summer.

The  SBIR  Program  began  in  1982  when  our  government  saw  a
need  to  increase  our  national  investment  in  research  and  develop-
ment  to  specifically  seek  technological  innovations  in  emerging
areas. The ultimate goal of the SBIR Program is to bring new prod-
ucts  and  technologies  to  commercialization  in  order  to  stimulate
international  competitiveness.  This  program  is  an  important  step-
ping stone in the overall goal to keep America’s competitive advan-
tage in the worldwide marketplace.

Under  the  SBIR  Program,  departments  and  agencies  with  an
R&D  budget  of  $100  million  or  more  are  required  to  actually  set
aside  2.5  percent  of  these  budgets  to  sponsor  research  at  small
companies. These awards are highly competitive with only the most
pioneering  and  innovative  companies  receiving  any  federal  money.
Currently 11 departments and agencies sponsor SBIR Programs in-

cluding the Department of Defense, Education, Health and Human
Services,  Homeland  Security,  Department  of  Energy,  as  well  as
NASA,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration,  the
National  Science  Foundation,  and  the  National  Institutes  of
Health.

The  SBIR  Program  is  divided  into  three  phases.  The  initial
phase,  Phase  I,  grants  awards  for  the  maximum  amount  of
$100,000  for  exploration  of  the  technical  merit  or  feasibility  of  an
idea  or  technology.  Phase  I  awardees  may  then  compete—once
again,  highly  competitive—for  Phase  II  awards  which  has  a  max-
imum award of $750,000 for research that expands upon promising
Phase I results. It is during this second phase of the program that
the developer evaluates the commercialization potential.

Phase III is that period during which Phase II innovation moves
from  the  laboratory  into  the  marketplace.  This  of  course  is  the  es-
sence of a technology transfer. It is important to note that no SBIR
funds  support  this  final  phase.  The  small  business  must  then  find
funding  in  the  private  sector  or  other  non-SBIR  federal  agency
funding  in  order  to  complete  the  technology  transition  to  commer-
cialization.

I  am  sure  there  are  many  people  outside  of  the  Federal  Govern-
ment that are not familiar, Mr. Chairman, with the SBIR Program.
However, I am here to tell you, and I know you agree with me, that
it  is  a  hidden  gem.  Agencies  give  a  percentage  of  their  major  fed-
eral  R&D  budget  to  support  our  country’s  most  ground-breaking
and  pioneering  small  businesses.  I  know  I  do  not  have  to  convince
anyone here that small businesses truly are the engine that drives
this  thriving  economy,  and  the  SBIR  Program  is  a  crucial  spark
that  initiates  this  success.  As  a  physician  five  years  removed  from
the  practice  of  OB/GYN,  I  am  keenly  interested  in  the  medical
breakthroughs  and  the  innovative  research  headquarters  at  NIH.
The  SBIR  Program  at  the  Institute  has  helped  spawn  new  hopes
for  victims  of  a  variety  of  diseases  such  as  cancer,  HIV/AIDS,  Alz-
heimer’s, and of course, especially Type I diabetes.

Neural  Signals  is  an  example  of  one  of  the  many  SBIR  success
stories,  and  it  is  located  in  my  home  state  of  Georgia.  Neural  Sig-
nals  allows  severely  paralyzed  or  locked-in  individuals  to  control
their  personal  computers  via  a  thought  control,  eliminating  com-
pletely the need for patient-initiated movement. Amazing.

Another  amazing  event  that’s  been  coming  out  of  the  SBIR  pro-
gram  is  from  a  company  named  Abiomed.  AbioCor  is  a  product
which  is  a  result  of  three  decades  of  research,  development,  and
testing  which  produced  the  world’s  first  completely  self-contained
replacement  heart.  This  is  an  outstanding  innovation  that  makes
real the day when heart failure, one of our biggest killers, will not
mean the end of life or the ability to enjoy life.

We will also hear from Anthony Ignagni of the Synapse company,
Synapse  Biomedical,  and  he  will  discuss  their  minimally-invasive
neuron  stimulation  devices  that  will  replace  or  assist  mechanical
ventilation.  Synapse  is  conducting  multi-centered  clinical  trials  at
locations  across  the  country,  including  the  Shepherd  Center  in  At-
lanta, which is the leading center for treatment of spinal cord inju-
ries  in  this  country.  I  was—had  the  opportunity  at  the  start  to
speak  to  Mr.  Ignagni  and  let  him  know  that  I  have  a  brother  who

volunteers  there  with  the  feeding  of  the  patients,  and  I  know  how
important it is to be able to help them with this kind of innovative
technology that leads to commercialization.

I am excited to hear the testimony and look forward to the testi-
mony  of  our  five  witnesses,  as  we  discuss  ways  to  improve  upon
this great SBIR Program.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  probably  took  a  little  longer  than  you  antici-
pated,  but  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  be  with  you  on  this
subcommittee  to  serve  with  you  on  this  subcommittee  and  on  the
Science  Committee  overall.  A  hearing  like  this  is  so,  so  important,
and I am glad to see a good audience in attendance; and with that,
I will yield back to you, Mr. Chairman.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gingrey follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Good  Afternoon.  I  would  like  to  thank  everyone  for  attending  today’s  hearing  of

the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee.

Today  we  will  be  looking  at  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  pro-
gram  as  it  goes  forward  to  its  Silver  Anniversary.  This  hearing  precedes  this  sub-
committee’s  markup  of  reauthorization  language  hopefully  sometime  this  summer.
The  SBIR  program  began  in  1982  when  our  government  saw  a  need  to  increase
our  national  investment  in  research  and  development  to  specifically  seek  techno-
logical  innovations  in  emerging  areas.  The  ultimate  goal  of  the  SBIR  program  is  to
bring  new  products  and  technologies  to  commercialization  in  order  to  stimulate
international  competitiveness.  This  program  is  an  important  stepping  stone  in  the
overall goal to keep America’s competitive advantage in the worldwide marketplace.
Under  the  SBIR  program,  departments  and  agencies  with  R&D  budgets  of  $100
million  or  more  are  required  to  set  aside  2.5  percent  of  these  budgets  to  sponsor
research  at  small  companies.  These  awards  are  highly  competitive  with  only  the
most pioneering and innovative companies receiving these federal monies.

Currently,  11  departments  and  agencies  sponsor  SBIR  programs  including:  the
Departments  of  Defense,  Education,  Health  and  Human  Services,  Homeland  Secu-
rity, and Energy, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.

The  SBIR  program  is  divided  up  into  three  phases.  The  initial  phase,  Phase  I,
grants awards with a maximum amount of $100,000 for exploration of the technical
merit  or  feasibility  of  an  idea  or  technology.  Phase  I  awardees  may  then  compete
for  a  Phase  II  award  which  has  a  maximum  award  of  up  to  $750,000  for  research
that  expands  upon  promising  Phase  I  results.  It  is  during  this  second  phase  of  the
program that the developer evaluates commercialization potential.

Phase  III  is  the  period  during  which  Phase  II  innovation  moves  from  the  labora-
tory  into  the  marketplace,  this  of  course  is  the  essence  of  technology  transfer.  It  is
important  to  note  that  no  SBIR  funds  support  this  final  phase.  The  small  business
must  find  funding  in  the  private  sector  or  other  non-SBIR  federal  agency  funding
in order to complete their technology’s transition to commercialization.

I’m  sure  there  are  many  people  outside  the  Federal  Government  that  are  not  fa-
miliar  with  the  SBIR  program.  However,  I  am  here  to  tell  you  it  is  a  hidden  gem.
Agencies give a percentage of their major federal R&D budget to support our coun-
try’s  most  groundbreaking  and  pioneering  small  businesses.  I  know  I  don’t  have  to
convince  anyone  here  that  small  businesses  truly  are  the  engine  that  drives  this
thriving economy and the SBIR program is a crucial spark to initiate their success.
As a physician, I am keenly interested in the medical breakthroughs and innova-

helped spawn new hopes for the victims of a variety of diseases such as cancer, HIV/

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  BRUCE  J.  HELD,  DIRECTOR  OF  THE
FORCE  DEVELOPMENT  AND  TECHNOLOGY  PROGRAM,  RAND
ARROYO CENTER, THE RAND CORPORATION
Mr.  HELD.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  testify  before  you  today.  My  testi-
mony  today  is  limited  to  the  Department  of  Defense’s  SBIR  Pro-
gram  and  primarily  draws  on  research  that  I  led  in  2004  what  is
now  the  DOD’s  Office  of  Small  Business  Programs.  While  the
DOD’s  SBIR  Program  is  generally  accomplishing  its  broad  legisla-
tive  goal,  it  is  not  particularly  effective  in  generating  technology
and  products  that  are  utilized  by  the  Armed  Forces.  As  a  result,
the  DOD  may  not  be  taking  the  best  advantage  of  the  program’s
research  result,  and  the  small  businesses  may  not  be  getting  the
commercialization  opportunities  that  would  turn  their  innovations
into sales and other sources of revenue.

There  appear  to  be  two  primary  reasons  for  this.  First,  the
DOD’s  acquisition  and  R&D  leadership  emphasis  for  the  program
has been on administrative efficiency and process issues associated
with executing the thousands of annual SBIR awards.

Second, most of the DOD’s program is managed out of its labora-
tories  and  research  centers.  While  these  centers  and  organizations
conduct and manage important R&D, that work tends to be earlier-
stage research that requires a long and difficult develop and transi-
tion  cycle  before  being  incorporated  into  the  equipment  being  used
by the Armed Forces.

For  the  program’s  small  business  participants,  staying  with  this
lengthy  and  non-transparent  process  is  exceptionally  difficult.  Ef-
forts in policies to improve the effectiveness of the DOD’s programs
should  therefore  have  two  related  goals:  first,  to  emphasize  re-
search outcomes and utilization rather than just process efficiency,
and second, to increase the participation of the acquisition commu-
nity in managing SBIR projects.

A  key  to  both  of  these  is  to  manage  the  program  flexibly,  so  it
can better meet the technology needs of the Department. For exam-
ple,  most  of  the  Armed  Services  and  DOD  agencies  only  have  one
or two SBIR solicitations a year. More flexible scheduling, however,
would include more solicitations to allow acquisition program man-
agers  to  use  SBIR  technology  development  projects  according  to
their own scheduling needs. Once awarded, SBIR project schedules
should  also  be  flexible  enough  to  accommodate  varying  program
and technology development requirements. Currently, the tendency
is  to  work  all  SBIR  projects  on  similar  schedules.  But  this  causes
delay  between  phases  that  hurt  both  the  potential  user  of  the  re-
search as well as the small businesses conducting the research.

Funding of projects also needs to be managed more flexibly, since
funding guidelines for the program have not changed in the last 15
years;  the  effective  award  size  has  declined  by  about  a  third,  thus
removing  a  portion  of  potential  research  projects  as  topic  can-
didates.  At  a  minimum,  guidelines  for  the  size  of  SBIR  awards
should be increased to account for inflation. Phase I awards should
be  at  least  $150,000;  Phase  II  awards  should  be  at  least
$1,125,000.  In  addition,  discretion  to  exceed  these  guidelines  for
important research needs needs to continue in the reauthorization.
Making the program more flexible in terms of project timing and
funding should improve its attractiveness to DOD’s acquisition pro-
gram managers, enhancing the probability that SBIR research out-
comes  will  transition  into  products  and  services  that  the  small
businesses  can  market  to  the  government  and  to  defense  indus-
tries.

Another  way  to  increase  both  flexibility  of  the  program  and  its
attractiveness  to  the  DOD’s  acquisition  program  managers  is  to
allow  a  portion  of  the  SBIR  set  aside  to  be  used  to  administer  the
program. Generally the cost for managing the DOD’s programs are
borne  out  of  organizational  overhead.  This  not  only  contributes  to
the  current  process  orientation  of  the  program,  but  since  the
projects are relatively small and are often perceived to be risky, ac-
quisition program managers are not inclined to spend their limited
overhead  managing  them.  If  administrative  resources  come  with
the  projects,  however,  they  may  find  these  SBIR  programs  to  be

14

more attractive as an additional technology source. The amount ul-
timately allocated for managing the program should be based on an
analysis  of  the  cost  associated  with  managing  similar  R&D  and
commercialization efforts.

Finally,  a  few  words  about  increasing  innovative  small  business
participation in the program. Since the program has been very suc-
cessful  in  attracting  new  companies  to  the  DOD  R&D  market  and
since  Phase  I  competition  remains  high,  the  real  question  should
be about increasing the quality of the participation. From the view-
point  of  both  the  small  businesses  and  the  DOD,  higher  quality
participation is mostly about transitioning research results into us-
able  technology  and  products.  This  means  making  the  program  a
resource  for  the  DOD’s  acquisition  managers,  not  just  a  tax  on
their R&D budgets. Absent steps to do this, it is unlikely that other
commercialization and financing efforts will be very successful. My
recommendation for program enhancements thus center around the
two  main  issues  I  mentioned  earlier.  The  DOD’s  leadership  must
move  from  a  process  orientation  to  one  that  is  outcome  utilization
oriented, and the acquisition community must have more responsi-
bility  for  the  program.  Both  of  these  actions  require  managing  the
program  flexibly  and  suggest  resourcing  it  in  a  way  that  reduces
the incentives for minimizing management effort at the expense of
technology transition success.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRUCE J. HELD1

Improving the Department of Defense’s Small Business

Innovation Research Program2

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  invitation
to  testify  before  you  today.  My  testimony  today  draws  primarily  on  research  that
I led in 2004 for the Department of Defense’s Small Business Technology and Indus-
trial Base Office (SBTIBO).3 The purpose of that research was to provide DOD with
insights  into  the  current  status  of  its  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)
program  in  terms  of  the  department’s  transformational  technology  priorities,  inno-
vation, and the small-business defense industrial base. Following that initial assess-
ment,  the  project’s  objective  became  the  recommendation  of  policy  options  for  mak-
ing the DOD SBIR program more responsive to the needs of the department.4 While
my testimony draws on this work, today I speak as an individual.

In  my  invitation  to  testify  today  I  was  asked  to  address  the  following  questions:
1. How  could  program  effectiveness  be  improved?  What  are  appropriate  award

levels? How should administration costs be funded?

2. How  can  the  programs  increase  the  participation  of  innovative  small  busi-

nesses in federal R&D?

3. What  program  enhancements  do  you  recommend  to  address  financing  and

commercialization assistance needs of participants?

Assessing the Current DOD SBIR Program

The DOD’s SBIR program appears to be accomplishing the broad goals set out in
the program’s enabling legislation. The program’s resources stimulate innovation by
funding  R&D  contracts  with  small  businesses  and,  in  fact,  the  DOD  SBIR  program
attracts  a  large  number  of  small  businesses  to  the  DOD  R&D  market;  roughly  250
to 400 new contractors each year. The DOD SBIR program also provides opportunity
for  minority-  and  women-owned  small  businesses  to  contract  with  DOD,  although
it is not as effective as other DOD R&D programs that specifically target these com-
panies.  Finally,  some  commercialization  of  DOD  R&D  appears  to  be  linked  to  the
SBIR  program.  However,  the  limited  information  available  indicates  that  commer-
cialization as a result of SBIR-funded research is concentrated in just a few compa-
nies.5

The effectiveness of the program in generating technology, products, services and
process  that  are  utilized  by  the  armed  forces  is  less  clear.6 As  a  result,  the  DOD
may  not  be  taking  the  best  advantage  of  the  research  results  that  emerge  from  its
SBIR program, and the small-business participants may not be getting the commer-
cialization  opportunities  that  would  turn  their  innovations  into  sales  or  other
sources of revenue.

There  appear  to  be  two  primary  reasons  that  the  DOD  SBIR  program  has  had
difficulty  transitioning  research  results.  First,  the  leadership  emphasis  for  the  pro-
gram  has  been  on  statutory  compliance  rather  than  research  outcome  and  utiliza-
tion.  The  result  is  a  management  orientation  that  is  more  focused  on  the  process
issues  associated  with  executing  the  thousands  of  SBIR  awards  than  it  is  with  uti-
lizing the results of those awards. Second, most of the DOD’s SBIR program is man-
aged  out  of  its  laboratories  and  research  centers.  Though  these  organizations  con-
duct  and  manage  important  research  for  the  DOD,  that  work  tends  to  be  earlier
stage  research  that  requires  a  long  and  difficult  development  and  transition  cycle
before being incorporated into the equipment or processes used by the armed forces.
How  SBIR  research  results  are  managed  through  this  transition  process  is  opaque
at  best.  For  the  SBIR  small  business  participants,  staying  with  this  lengthy  and
non-transparent process is exceptionally difficult.
Improving the DOD SBIR Program

Efforts  and  policies  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  DOD’s  SBIR  program

should, therefore, have two related goals:

1. To  move  the  DOD  leadership’s  emphasis  for  the  program  from  compliance

and process issues to improving research outcomes and utilization.

2. To  increase  the  participation  of  the  DOD’s  acquisition  community  in  man-

aging SBIR projects.

Emphasizing research outcomes and utilization by the leadership requires empha-
sizing SBIR program flexibility to meet the technology needs of the DOD. For exam-
ple,  current  practice  within  the  DOD  limits  solicitations  for  SBIR  projects  to  only
one  or  two  per  year.7 This  means  that  if  a  technology  requirement  arises  shortly
after a solicitation has been published, the program will not be able to address that
need for six-months or a year.8 This kind of set schedule is designed for process effi-

5 For example, in our research we examined the DOD contracting histories of small companies
that first contracted with the DOD through the SBIR program. In 1995 256 companies used the
SBIR program as their entre´e into the DOD market and in 1999 the number was 227. Of these
483 companies, only six account for 95 percent of the dollar value of subsequent non-SBIR DOD
contracts. Additionally, an examination of self-reported commercialization data from DOD SBIR
participants indicates just one percent of the companies account for 50 percent of all sales trace-
able to an SBIR project. The same data base indicates that overall sales success from DOD SBIR
projects is relatively low: the sales to SBIR investment ratio is 1.17. This compares to commer-
cial sales to R&D investment ratios of about 25 to one.

6 This  is  despite  an  elaborate  topic  selection  and  approval  process  that  is  designed  to  insure
that  the  topics  align  with  the  DOD’s  research  priorities  and  are  coordinated  across  the  depart-
ment.

7 Across the DOD there are three solicitations per year, but most services and agencies in the

DOD only participate in one or two per year.

8 This  does  not  take  into  account  additional  time  required  to  process  the  topic  request  for  in-
clusion in the solicitation. Additionally, even if a technology requirement is timely addressed in
a solicitation, most of the DOD’s services and agencies manage the research contracts somewhat
inflexibly.  Phase  I  contracts  last  six  months,  putting  a  Phase  II  contract  in  place  takes  several
months and the Phase II contract will last about two years.

ciency rather than for meeting the research needs of the DOD. More frequent solici-
tations will require additional effort, but are likely to be more attractive to program
and technology managers who are managing development schedules.

Funding of DOD SBIR projects will also need to be managed more flexibly. Fund-
ing  guidelines  for  SBIR  projects  have  not  changed  in  the  last  fifteen  years.  This
means  that  the  effective  size  of  the  award  has  declined  by  a  third,  thus  removing
a  significant  portion  of  the  potential  research  projects  from  the  SBIR  program.  In
order  to  correct  this  issue,  guidelines  for  the  size  of  SBIR  awards  should  be  in-
creased  to  account  for  inflation.  Phase  I  award  limits  should  be  at  least  $150,000
and  Phase  II  award  limits  should  be  at  least  $1,125,000.  In  addition,  flexibility  to
exceed  these  guidelines  needs  to  continue  to  be  maintained  in  the  reauthorization,
particularly  where  important  DOD  technology  requirements  could  be  addressed  by
the SBIR program, but where the project size exceeds the general guidelines.9 While
smaller  awards  mean  that  more  awards  are  available,  larger  awards  mean  in-
creased  flexibility  to  address  the  DOD’s  technology  requirements  through  the  SBIR
program.  That  added  flexibility  has  the  potential  to  improve  the  probability  that
SBIR  research  outcomes  will  transition  into  products  and  services  that  the  small-
business  participants  can  market  to  the  DOD  and  to  the  broader  defense  industry.
Currently, the administrative costs for managing the DOD SBIR program are gen-
erally  borne  out  of  the  overhead  of  the  organizations  within  DOD  charged  with
SBIR  program  responsibility.10 As  a  result,  the  incentive  for  these  organizations  is
to  minimize  the  effort  put  into  managing  the  program,  contributing  to  the  process
orientation  that  the  program  exhibits.  Allowing  a  portion  of  the  SBIR  set-aside  to
be used to administer the program would help alleviate this incentive problem.

Perhaps  more  important,  allowing  administrative  costs  to  be  recovered  from  the
set-aside  for  the  program  would  make  it  more  attractive  to  the  DOD’s  acquisition
program managers. The DOD’s acquisition program managers contribute the major-
ity of the DOD SBIR program’s funds because they are primarily responsible for the
majority  of  the  DOD’s  R&D  budget  from  which  the  set-aside  is  applied.  As  noted
earlier,  however,  across  most  of  DOD  the  SBIR  program  is  managed  by  the  labora-
tories and research centers. There are likely a number of reasons for this, including
explicit  policy  decisions.  However,  the  disincentive  for  acquisition  program  man-
agers  to  request  SBIR  projects  is  also  a  factor.  Program  management  offices  are
typically relatively small offices so the resources to manage additional small projects
and contracts are at a premium. If resources are provided to manage these projects
and  contracts,  then  it  is  likely  that  program  managers  will  be  more  inclined  to  re-
quest access back to some of the resources they provided to the SBIR program. Com-
bining  earmarked  SBIR  administrative  resources  with  increased  SBIR  program
flexibility in terms of solicitation timing, project duration and funding amounts, the
SBIR program could be turned into a more sought after resource by DOD’s acquisi-
tion program managers.

While  research  is  currently  on-going  to  determine  the  total  cost  of  managing  the
DOD’s  SBIR  program,  previous  research  suggests  that  the  DOD  invests  fewer  re-
sources  into  managing  its  SBIR  program  than  analogous  R&D  efforts.  To  meet  ex-
pectations  about  commercializing  SBIR  program  results,  the  amount  allocated  for
managing the SBIR program should be based on an analysis of the costs associated
with  managing  other  commercial,  governmental  and  academic  R&D  and  commer-
cialization  efforts.  The  venture  capital  industry,  for  example,  charges  annual  man-
agement  fees  of  2.5  to  five  percent  of  funds  under  management  and  also  earns  a
significant portion of any return on investment.11
Increasing Small Business Participation in the DOD SBIR Program

The  suggestions  already  made  for  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  DOD  SBIR
program  are  related  to  the  second  question  I  was  asked  to  address:  How  can  the
programs increase the participation of innovative small businesses in federal R&D?
As noted earlier, the DOD SBIR program has been very successful in attracting new
companies  to  the  DOD  R&D  market.  Moreover,  the  DOD  receives  nearly  six  pro-
posals  for  every  Phase  I  award  it  makes.  The  question  should,  therefore,  be  more

9 Under current legislation, an awarding agency may determine that a particular SBIR award
merits  greater  funding.  Such  awards  require  only  that,  after  the  fact,  a  written  justification  be
submitted along with the annual SBIR report to the SBA. This flexibility seems warranted and
could even be encouraged in the reauthorization to ensure that program managers feel empow-
ered to make such judgments.

10 The  Navy  is  an  exception.  It  collects,  in  addition  to  the  SBIR  set-aside,  an  amount  from

its R&D budget to manage the SBIR program.

11 Since  the  venture  capital  management  fees  are  assessed  annually  on  funds  under  manage-

ment a direct comparison to SBIR overhead rates understates the VC management fee.

about increasing the quality of the participation rather than about the overall num-
ber of companies participating.

Over  the  course  of  our  research  we  identified  four  distinct  business  models  for
DOD  SBIR  award  winners.  The  entrepreneurial  model  is  generally  a  new  business
created  specifically  to  develop  an  idea  into  some  product  or  service.  The  SBIR  pro-
gram  is  a  source  of  relatively  inexpensive  capital  for  developing  these  ideas.  The
mature  business  model  is  a  business  that  has  been  around  for  some  time  and  that
uses  the  SBIR  program  as  a  source  of  low-cost  capital  for  research.  Related  to  the
mature  business  model  are  other  established  small  companies  who  have  not  pre-
viously  done  business  with  the  DOD  and  use  the  SBIR  program  to  enter  that  mar-
ket.  Finally  there  is  the  research  house.  These  companies  provide  research  as  a
service and use the SBIR to provide their services to the DOD. In all of these mod-
els,  perhaps  with  the  exception  of  the  research  house,  the  ultimate  goal  for  con-
ducting research is to develop a marketable product or service.12 In our discussions
with  the  small-business  participants,  however,  one  theme  seemed  fairly  constant.
While these companies were successfully competing for SBIR awards, they were not
successful in marketing and selling the results of their research projects to the DOD
for  transition  into  products,  processes  or  services.  These  interview  results  reinforce
the  data  cited  earlier  that  any  success  in  transitioning  DOD  SBIR  research  is  con-
centrated in a very few companies. Improving the quality of the small business par-
ticipation in the DOD SBIR program must, therefore, mean improving the likelihood
that the research these companies conduct will be marketable to the DOD’s acquisi-
tion  community  and  will  transition  into  equipment,  services  and  processes  used  by
the armed forces. Making this happen will require much greater participation by the
DOD’s  program  managers  and  program  executive  officers  in  the  SBIR  program.  If
this  can  be  made  to  happen,  the  attractiveness  of  the  DOD  SBIR  program  to  the
small-business  community  will  be  increased  and  greater  participation  and  competi-
tion would result.

Absent  steps  to  increase  the  willingness  and  capability  of  the  DOD  acquisition
community  to  participate  in  the  SBIR  program,  it  is  unlikely  that  other  commer-
cialization  and  financing  efforts  will  be  very  successful.  My  recommendations  for
SBIR program enhancements, thus, center around the two main issues I mentioned
earlier. The DOD leadership must shift the process orientation of its SBIR program
to  one  that  is  more  outcome  and  utilization  oriented.  This  requires  managing  the
program’s  flexibly  to  responsively  address  the  DOD’s  technology  requirements,  and
it  means  resourcing  the  SBIR  program  in  a  way  that  reduces  the  incentives  for
minimizing  the  management  effort  at  the  expense  of  technology  transition  success.
In  addition,  policies  that  require  and  encourage  DOD’s  acquisition  program  man-

STATEMENT OF MR. JON BARON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COA-
LITION  FOR  EVIDENCE-BASED  POLICY,  COUNCIL  FOR  EX-
CELLENCE IN GOVERNMENT
Mr.  BARON.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Wu.  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking
Member  Gingrey,  and  Congressman  Mitchell,  I  appreciate  the  op-
portunity  to  testify  on  SBIR.  My  testimony  draws  on  my  involve-
ment in the SBIR Program since 1990 in a number of different ca-
pacities,  first  as  counsel  to  the  House  Small  Business  Committee
where  I  was  the  lead  staffer  for  the  1992  reauthorization  of  SBIR,
second  as  the  Program  Manager  for  the  Defense  Department’s
SBIR and STTR programs where I introduced and led reforms that
were  found  highly  effective  in  an  independent  evaluation  by  the
National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  received  the  Vice-President’s
Hammer Award, and third, as a member of the steering committee
for the National Academy of Sciences’ study the SBIR programs in
2003.

The  views  I  express  here  are  my  own,  and  I  want  to  mention
that  my  organization  is  not  funded  by  SBIR.  And  so  we  have  no
financial interest in the ideas I’m advocating.

Let  me  first  briefly  address  the  contribution  of  SBIR  to  the
American  economy  and  then  suggest  a  few  ways  consistent  with
your question on how the program might be improved.

The  contribution.  In  several  instances,  the  SBIR  has  spawned
breakthrough  technologies  that  have  transformed  their  field  and
made  a  major  contribution  to  the  American  economy.  Let  me  give
you two quick examples. Under SBIR, Science Research Laboratory
of  Somerville,  Massachusetts,  developed  a  set  of  technologies  that
greatly improved the performance and reliability of excimer lasers,
improvements which for the first time made these lasers a commer-
cially  viable  tool  for  writing  integrated  circuits  onto  computer
chips.  These  lasers  increased  by  about  a  third  the  number  of  cir-
cuits  you  can  fit  on  a  chip.  It  rapidly  became  the  state-of-the-art
technology  for  chip  production  around  the  world  and  thereby  in-
creased the competing power of virtually every commercial and de-
fense system that has been developed since the 1990s. Sales of the
excimer  lasers  now  exceed  one-fourth  of  a  billion  dollars  annually.
It is an enormous impact.

As  a  second  example  from  biomedical  sciences,  Martek  Corpora-
tion  under  SBIR  developed  new  technologies  for  producing  omega-
3  fatty  acids  called  DHA  and  ARA  which  have  been  approved  by
the FDA for use in infant formula so that it more closely resembles
breast milk. Mark’s DHA and RHA are now added to nearly 90 per-
cent  of  infant  formula  in  the  Unites  States,  sold  in  more  than  65
countries  overseas,  and  have  been  consumed  by  an  estimated  24
million  infants.  Importantly,  these  fatty  acids  have  been  shown  in
randomized  clinical  trials  to  increase  the  height,  weight,  cognitive
development, and motor development of pre-term infants. Martek’s
technology  has  thereby  contributed  in  a  fundamental  way  not  only
to  the  economy  but  to  the  life  and  health  of  millions  of  children
around the world.

Moving on to the second part of my testimony, there is good rea-
son  to  believe  that  a  few  modifications  to  the  SBIR  Program  could
substantially increase its success in producing these kind of break-
through technologies.

Since the program was established 24 years ago, it spawned per-
haps 10 to 20 of these breakthroughs which have transformed their
field. In addition to these, it has produced a number of smaller but
still important technological and commercial successes.

Then  in  a  third  category,  some  SBIR  projects  have  not  produced
significant  technology  commercialization.  GAO  and  DOD  data  sug-
gest  that  over  half  of  SBIR  Phase  II’s  fall  into  this  third  category
of  no  significant  commercialization.  And  in  part,  that’s  the  nature
of  research  and  development.  One  can  expect  only  a  fraction  of
projects  will  succeed  and  fewer  still  become  breakthroughs.  But
there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  program  could  achieve  sub-
stantially  higher  success  rates  in  producing  such  breakthroughs.
Specifically  the  GAO  and  DOD  data  show  that  some  SBIR  compa-
nies,  perhaps  as  many  as  half  of  those  that  have  participated  long
enough  to  build  a  track  record,  consistently  are  unable  to  convert
their SBIR awards into viable new products sold either to the gov-
ernment,  military,  or  the  private  sector.  These  are  companies  that
usually  have  strong  research  capabilities,  therefore  they  win  SBIR
awards,  but  they  lack  entrepreneurial  capabilities  and,  in  some
cases,  the  motivation  to  convert  their  research  into  successful  new
products. Many of these companies find the commercialization proc-
ess  unfamiliar,  outside  their  skill  set,  and  daunting.  And  so  modi-
fications  to  the  program  that  provide  strong  incentives  or  assist-
ance  for  SBIR  awardees  to  strengthen  their  entrepreneurial  capa-
bilities  could  potentially  greatly  increase  the  program’s  success  in
spawning these kind of breakthroughs that make an enormous con-
tribution to the economy.

The  federal  agencies  recognize  this  problem,  many  of  them,  and
have  taken  a  lot  of  steps  over  the  last  25  years  to  try  to  address
it.  I’ll  mention  a  couple  of  those  in  a  minute,  but  what  I  want  to
mention is this, that none of these innovations in how the program
is  managed  have  ever  been  evaluated  in  a  study  rigorous  enough
to  provide  strong  evidence  of  the  innovation  has  an  effect  on  key
SBIR outcomes such as commercialization.

And  so,  despite  the  program’s  24  years  in  existence,  we  have
many  good  hypotheses  but  no  scientifically  valid  evidence  about
what  works  in  improving  the  program’s  performance.  That  is  the
central  idea  I  wish  to  convey  in  my  testimony,  that  the  ideas  we
are discussing for SBIR improvement today are similar to the ones
that were discussed in 2000 during that reauthorization and in the
1992 reauthorization that I participated in. At the agency level, pi-
lots and demonstrations come and go, but without rigorous evalua-
tion of them, little has been learned about what worked.

And  so,  my  recommendation,  as  a  concrete  way  to  address  this,
is  that  Congress  allocate  a  small  percentage,  perhaps  one  percent
of  the  smaller  agencies,  less  at  the  larger  agencies,  of  their  SBIR
funds,  to  conduct  rigorous  evaluations  of  new  approaches  to  build-
ing  their  awardees’  entrepreneurial  capabilities.  Let  me  just  give
one quick example, and I will wrap up—of how this might work at
modest cost and burden.

In  a  true  randomized  control  trial,  considered  the  gold  standard
of study designs for figuring out what works, an agency could ran-
domly  assign  half  of  its  SBIR  awardees  to  a  treatment  group  that
is  eligible  for  a  larger  Phase  II  award  if  it  obtains  matching  funds

from  a  commercial  investor  (and  that  is  already  done  in  a  pilot
basis under the National Science Foundation’s Phase II–B process)
or assign its other awardees to a control group that participates in
the agency’s usual SBIR process without this matching fund incen-
tive.  And  then  the  evaluation  would  track  commercialization  out-
comes to the two groups over time to determine whether this Phase
II–B  incentive  made  a  difference  in  such  outcomes.  At  agencies
which  collect  good  commercialization  outcome  data  like  DOD,  this
kind of rigorous study, producing scientifically valid evidence about
whether  the  darn  thing  worked,  could  be  conducted  at  relatively
low cost, perhaps $250,000 per year over five years.

That is one approach, the matching funds idea, that I would sug-
gest merits evaluation in a rigorous evaluation. And one other that
may  merit  such  evaluation  is  the  idea  of  using  a  company’s  com-
mercialization  track  record,  how  well  has  it  done  commercializing
its  previous  SBIR  awards,  as  a  criterion  for  evaluating  its  current
SBIR  proposals  and  deciding  whether  it  should  get  an  additional
award.

And with that, I conclude. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Baron follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JON BARON

Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  Members  of  Science  and  Tech-

nology Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation:

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  reauthorization  of  the  SBIR  pro-
gram.  My  testimony  draws  on  my  involvement  in  the  SBIR  program  since  1990  in
several different capacities—

• First,  as  Counsel  to  the  House  Small  Business  Committee,  where  I  was  the
lead  staffer  for  the  1992  reauthorization  of  SBIR  and  establishment  of  the
STTR program;
• Second,  as  the  Program  Manager  for  the  Defense  Department’s  SBIR  and
STTR programs from 1995–2000, where I introduced and led program reforms
that were found highly effective in an independent evaluation by the National
Academy  of  Sciences,  and  received  the  Vice  President’s  Hammer  Award  for
reinventing government; and
• Third,  as  a  member  of  the  Steering  Committee  for  the  National  Academy  of

Sciences’ study the SBIR program since 2003.

However, the views expressed here are my own.
My  testimony  will  briefly  address  the  contribution  of  the  SBIR  program  to  the
American economy, and then suggest ways in which the program might be strength-
ened, so as to increase that contribution.
In  several  instances,  the  SBIR  program  has  spawned  breakthrough  tech-
nologies  that  have  transformed  their  field  and  made  a  major  contribution
to the American economy.

Here are two illustrative examples. Under the Department of Defense and Depart-
ment of Energy SBIR programs, Science Research Laboratory of Somerville, Massa-
chusetts developed a set of technologies that greatly improved the performance and
reliability  of  ‘‘excimer  lasers’’—improvements  which,  for  the  first  time,  made  these
lasers a commercially-viable tool for writing circuits onto computer chips. The lasers
increased, by about one-third, the number of circuits one can fit onto a chip, rapidly
became  the  state-of-the-art  technology  in  chip  production  worldwide,  and  have
thereby  increased  the  computing  power  of  virtually  every  commercial  and  military
system developed since the late 1990s. Sales of excimer lasers now exceed $250 mil-
lion annually.

As a second example, under the NIH SBIR program, Martek Biosciences Corpora-
tion of Columbia, Maryland developed new technologies for producing omega-3 fatty
acids  called  DHA  and  ARA,  which  have  been  approved  by  the  Food  and  Drug  Ad-
ministration for use in infant formula, so that it more closely resembles breast milk.
Martek’s DHA and RHA are now added to nearly 90 percent of infant formula used

in  the  United  States,  and  are  also  sold  overseas  in  more  than  65  countries.  They
have  been  consumed  by  over  24  million  babies  worldwide.  Importantly,  these  fatty
acids  have  been  shown  in  randomized  clinical  trials  to  increase  the  height,  weight,
cognitive  development,  and  motor  development  of  pre-term  infants  by  age  two.
Martek’s SBIR-developed technology has thereby contributed, in a fundamental way,
not only to the American economy, but also to the life and health of millions of chil-
dren worldwide.
There  is  reason  to  believe  that  a  few  modifications  to  the  SBIR  program
could  substantially  increase  its  success  in  producing  such  breakthrough
technologies.

Since  the  SBIR  program  was  launched  in  1983,  it  has  spawned  perhaps  10–20
‘‘breakthrough’’  technologies  like  those  I  just  summarized—that  is,  technologies
which  transformed  their  field  and  became  major  commercial  successes.  In  addition
to these, the program has produced a number of smaller but still important techno-
logical and commercial successes. And then, in a third category, some SBIR projects
have  not  produced  significant  technology  commercialization  in  either  commercial  or
government  markets.  GAO  studies  of  the  program,  as  well  as  the  results  of  DOD’s
own studies, suggest that over half of SBIR phase II projects fall into this category
of no significant commercialization.

In part, that is the nature of high-risk R&D—one can expect that only a fraction
of  projects  will  succeed,  and  fewer  still  will  be  breakthrough  successes.  However,
there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  program  could  achieve  substantially  higher
success  in  producing  such  breakthroughs.  Specifically,  the  GAO  studies  and  DOD
data show that some SBIR companies—perhaps as many as half of those that have
participated long enough to build a track record—consistently are unable to convert
their  SBIR  awards  into  viable  new  products  sold  to  commercial  or  government  cus-
tomers.  These  are  companies  which  usually  have  strong  research  capabilities—
which is why they win SBIR awards—but lack the entrepreneurial capabilities, and
in some cases the motivation, to convert their research into successful new products.
Many  of  these  companies  find  the  commercialization  process  to  be  unfamiliar,  out-
side their skill set, and daunting.

Thus, modifications to the SBIR program that provide strong incentives and/or as-
sistance to SBIR awardees to strengthen their entrepreneurial capabilities could po-
tentially  correct  this  source  of  systematic  under-performance,  and  greatly  increase
the  program’s  success  in  spawning  commercially-successful  technologies  that  make
a major contribution to U.S. economic capabilities.
Many of the federal agencies recognize this problem—that SBIR companies
often  lack  key  entrepreneurial  capabilities—and  have  tried  innovative  ap-
proaches to address it.

Illustrative examples of approaches that agencies have tried include:

a key criterion for evaluating its current SBIR proposals;

• Giving  a  competitive  priority,  and/or  additional  funding,  to  SBIR  applicants
or awardees that obtain matching funds from a third-party commercial inves-
tor;
• Using  a  company’s  track  record  in  commercializing  its  prior  SBIR  awards  as
• Providing  training  to  SBIR  awardees  in  commercializing  their  SBIR  tech-
• Requiring  SBIR  applicants  to  include  a  streamlined  business  plan  in  their
• Including  individuals  with  business  experience  on  the  SBIR  proposal  review
• Increasing the involvement of potential customers for SBIR products—such as
DOD  acquisition  program  offices—in  the  development  of  SBIR  solicitation
topics.

panels; and

nologies;

proposal;

However, none of these innovations in program management has ever been
evaluated  in  a  study  rigorous  enough  to  provide  strong  evidence  of  its  ef-
fect  on  key  SBIR  outcomes—outcomes  such  as  commercialization  and  con-
tribution to scientific understanding.

And so, even though the SBIR program has been around for nearly a quarter-cen-
tury, we have many good hypotheses but no scientifically-valid evidence about ‘‘what
works’’ in improving program performance. That is the central idea I wish to convey
in  my  testimony.  The  ideas  for  SBIR  program  improvement  that  we’re  discussing
in  the  current  reauthorization  process  are  similar  to  the  ones  that  were  discussed

in  the  2000  reauthorization,  and  in  the  1992  reauthorization  before  that.  At  the
agency  level,  pilots  and  demonstrations  come  and  go,  but  without  rigorous  evalua-
tion, little has been learned about what worked.1

Thus,  I’d  recommend  that  Congress  direct  the  agencies  to  allocate  one  percent  of
their SBIR funds to conduct scientifically-rigorous evaluations of new approaches to
building awardees’ entrepreneurial abilities.

Wherever  possible,  these  experiments  should  randomly  assign  SBIR  program  ap-
plicants, awardees, and/or research topics to the new approach or to a control group
that participates in the agency’s usual SBIR process. Such randomized experiments
are recognized as the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a strategy or
approach across many diverse fields because, uniquely, they enable one to determine
to a high degree of confidence whether the new approach itself, as opposed to other
factors, causes the observed outcomes.2

Some SBIR approaches would readily lend themselves to such a randomized eval-
uation,  at  modest  cost  and  administrative  burden.  For  example,  an  agency  could
randomly  assign  half  of  its  SBIR  awardees  to  a  ‘‘treatment’’  group  that  is  eligible
for a larger phase II award if it obtains matching funds from a commercial investor
(as  is  done  under  the  National  Science  Foundation’s  ‘‘Phase  II–B’’  process),  and  its
other awardees to a control group that participates in the agency’s usual SBIR proc-
ess,  without  this  Phase  II–B.  The  evaluation  would  then  track  commercialization
outcomes for the two groups over time, to determine whether the Phase II–B incen-
tive  made  a  difference  in  such  outcomes.  At  agencies  such  as  DOD  that  already
track commercialization outcome data for most of their SBIR awardees, this rigorous
study  could  be  conducted  at  a  low  cost  by  using  such  data—perhaps  $250,000  per
year over five years as a rough estimate.
Based  on  existing  evidence,  I’d  suggest  two  approaches  to  improving  the
SBIR  program  that  may  merit  particular  consideration  for  these  rigorous
evaluations.

The  first  of  these  is  the  approach  of  providing  a  larger  phase  II  award,  and/or  a
competitive priority in the phase II proposal evaluation process, to SBIR companies
that  obtain  at  least  a  partial  match  of  funds  from  a  third-party  investor.  The  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation’s  ‘‘Phase  II–B’’  award,  and  DOD’s  ‘‘Fast  Track’’  and
‘‘Phase II Enhancement’’ policies, are specific versions of this approach. The ration-
ale  for  this  approach  is  that  an  investor’s  hard  commitment  of  matching  funds  is
a  strong  endorsement  of  the  SBIR  company’s  entrepreneurial  capabilities  and  the
market  size  (commercial  or  military)  for  its  technology.  The  National  Academy  of
Sciences’  study  of  DOD’s  Fast  Track  provides  initial  evidence  that  this  approach
yields  much  higher  commercialization  and  research  outcomes—evidence  which,  I’d
suggest, merits confirmation in a randomized evaluation.

The  second  approach  I’d  recommend  testing  in  a  rigorous  evaluation  is  that  of
using  a  company’s  track  record  in  commercializing  its  prior  SBIR  awards  as  a  key

1 The one partial exception is the National Academy of Sciences’ 1999 study of the DOD ‘‘Fast
Track,’’ which is the most rigorous and impartial evaluation to date of a new approach to imple-
menting the SBIR program. That study compared research and commercialization outcomes for
DOD Fast Track SBIR projects to outcomes for a statistically-matched comparison group of non-
Fast  Track  projects.  The  study  found  that  the  Fast  Track  projects  achieved  much  higher  levels
of  commercialization  and  made  a  larger  contribution  to  the  agency’s  research  program  than
projects  in  the  comparison  group.  These  results,  although  highly  valuable,  should  nevertheless
be  interpreted  with  caution  because  SBIR  companies  self-selected  themselves  into  the  Fast
Track  versus  the  comparison  group,  raising  the  possibility  that  any  difference  in  outcomes  be-
tween  the  two  groups  is  due  to  inherent  differences  in  their  motivation  or  capabilities,  rather
than  the  Fast  Track  approach  itself.  There  is  consistent  evidence  from  many  different  policy
areas  that  such  comparison-group  studies,  although  extremely  useful  in  generating  good
hypotheses  about  what  works,  may  sometimes  produce  erroneous  conclusions  about  an
approach’s effectiveness (for a summary of this evidence, see Office of Management and Budget,
What  Constitutes  Strong  Evidence  of  Program  Effectiveness,  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
part/2004¥program¥eval.pdf, 2004, pp. 4–8).

criterion  for  evaluating  its  current  SBIR  proposals.  As  noted  earlier,  some  agencies
such  as  DOD  collect  excellent  data  on  companies’  commercialization  track  records.
These  agencies  could  readily  use  this  data  in  their  proposal  evaluation  process  to
focus  funds  on  companies  that  either  have  a  strong  SBIR  commercialization  track
record or are new to the SBIR program, and away from companies that have repeat-
edly  won  SBIR  awards  but  not  commercialized.  A  rigorous  evaluation  could  deter-
mine  whether  this  promising  idea  does  in  fact  improve  the  SBIR  program’s  overall
research and commercialization outcomes.
Conclusion:  Over  time,  these  rigorous  studies  could  produce  scientifically-
valid,  actionable  evidence  about  ‘‘what  works’’  to  increase  SBIR’s  success
in spawning breakthrough technologies—evidence which, I’d suggest, is the
critical  missing  piece  that  the  agencies  and  Congress  need  to  turn  SBIR
into  a  more  powerful  engine  for  American  innovation  and  economic
growth.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JON BARON

Jon Baron founded the nonprofit, nonpartisan Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy
in  fall  2001,  and  currently  serves  as  its  Executive  Director.  The  Coalition  is  spon-
sored by the Council for Excellence in Government. Since its founding, the Coalition
has built a strong track record of success in working with top Executive Branch and
Congressional  policy-makers  to  advance  evidence-based  reforms  in  major  federal
programs.  A  recent  independent  evaluation  of  the  Coalition’s  work,  conducted  for
the  William  T.  Grant  Foundation,  found  that  the  Coalition  has  been  ‘‘instrumental
in  transforming  a  theoretical  advocacy  of  evidence-based  policy  among  certain  [fed-
eral] agencies into an operational reality.’’

Based  on  this  work,  Mr.  Baron  was  nominated  by  the  President,  and  confirmed
by the Senate in 2004, to serve on the National Board for Education Sciences, which
helps  set  the  research  priorities  and  agenda  for  the  U.S.  Education  Department’s
Institute of Education Sciences.

Prior to establishing the Coalition, Mr. Baron served as the Executive Director of

making  tiny  MEMS  devices  and  creating  third  generation  flight
controls  which  we  are  developing  for  the  military.  My  two  compa-
nies  have  70  full-time  employees,  and  we  train  about  a  dozen  col-
lege  interns  each  semester.  Harvard  and  Inc.  Magazine  have  both
recognized our rapid growth.

I have four major points today. First, the United States will have
to push very hard to keep up with global technological competition.
In  many  respects,  we  are  already  behind.  The  United  States  ac-
counts  for  just  16  percent  of  the  world’s  high-tech  imports,  half  of
what  it  was  in  1980.  What  is  worse,  we  went  from  a  $30  billion
trade  surplus  in  technology  exports  ten  years  ago  to  a  $45  billion
deficit in 2005.

Second,  wealth  today  correlates  with  the  ownership  of  knowl-
edge.  A  Federal  Reserve  Bank  study  showed  the  most  important
factor for economic growth in the country is patents. That is right,
patents,  bigger  than  education  which  was  in  second  place,  bigger
by  far  than  industry  structure,  public  finance,  taxation,  business
failure  rates  and  a  host  of  other  variables.  Where  are  American
patents  coming  from  today?  The  SBIR  Program  generates  55  per-
cent more patents than all of our universities combined. That is on
one-twelfth as many federal R&D dollars. 55 percent more patents
for one-twelfth of the cost.

Third,  SBIR  and  STTR  Programs  are  good  for  universities,  and
we are important partners with them. SBIR researchers often have
ties  to  universities,  and  STTR  research  always  do.  Together  they
help  universities  strengthen  the  commercialization  of  innovations
and  focus  the  research  leading  to  new  income  streams  for  the
schools  and  valuable  technology  transfer  for  the  Nation.  Most  im-
portant, SBIR companies provide job opportunities that attract stu-
dents into science and technology.

Fourth, today more scientists and engineers work for small com-
panies  than  for  large  companies  and  for  universities  and  federal
labs  combined.  Small  companies  employ  32  percent  of  all  the  Na-
tion’s  scientists  and  engineers,  yet  we  receive  only  4.3  percent  of
the  federal  R&D  dollars,  and  SBIR  and  STTR  account  for  most  of
that.  Small  businesses  produce  20  times  more  patents  per  R&D
dollars  than  universities  and  five  times  more  than  large  busi-
nesses.  Small  businesses  are  America’s  golden  goose.  The  very
group  that  is  most  productive  for  wealth  creation  and  job  creation
receives only about one-eighth of its fair share.

Federal R&D expenditures are far too concentrated. For example,
at DOD one company receives seven times more R&D dollars than
all  SBIR  companies  combined.  The  top  three  companies  at  DOD
have received more R&D dollars in one year than all SBIR compa-
nies have received government-wide in the entire 25-year history of
the program.

What  should  Congress  do  now?  We  believe  it  is  time  to  unleash
American  innovation  and  gradually  double  the  SBIR  and  STTR
programs  and  make  them  permanent.  A  number  of  current  pro-
posals would require SBIR to hire more consultants, give money to
large,  multi-national  companies,  allow  venture—large  venture  cap-
ital  companies  rather  than  only  small  venture  capital  companies
control  in  SBIR  companies  and  pay  more  federal  agency  adminis-
trative expenses.

What  all  of  these  proposals  have  in  common  is  reducing  the  in-
vestment  that  actually  goes  to  the  small  companies  and  blurring
SBIR’s  focus  on  developing  innovations.  Without  additional  funds
to support those proposals, we will have fewer jobs and patents, not
more in the future. The SBIR Program has shown that it will help
America  catch  up  and  stay  ahead  globally.  If  you  agree  that  grow-
ing  new  companies  and  jobs  for  scientists  and  engineers  and  cre-
ating patents and new technologies are crucial, then SBIR needs to
be  larger,  not  smaller.  Even  the  smallest  cuts  in  dollars  actually
going to the innovative small companies, however well-intentioned,
will cost us internationally. Let us build on our SBIR success.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT N. SCHMIDT

Chairman Wu, Representative Gingrey, Members of the Subcommittee, good after-
noon.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  appear  here  today.  I  am  Bob  Schmidt,  founder
and  President  of  Cleveland  Medical  Devices,  Inc.  and  of  Orbital  Research,  Inc.
CleveMed  makes  brain  monitoring  devices  that  we  sell  all  over  the  world.  Orbital
Research  makes  microelectomechanical  (MEMS)  systems  and  is  developing  third-
generation  flight  control  technologies  for  the  U.S.  military.  My  two  companies  em-
ploy about 70 people, and we train about a dozen students each semester. We have
researched,  developed,  and  commercialized  new  technologies  through  the  Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.

Harvard University and Inc. Magazine, among others, have recognized the compa-
nies’ rapid growth. And we have received two Tibbetts Awards, which are given an-
nually to outstanding companies in the SBIR Program.

I am also here today on behalf of the Small Business Technology Council, the Na-
tion’s  largest  organization  of  small,  technology-based  companies  in  diverse  fields.
Over 250 SBTC companies have won SBIR contract awards, from all eleven issuing
agencies, making SBTC also the largest concentration of SBIR award winners from
across the government.

SBTC  serves  as  the  Technology  Council  of  the  National  Small  Business  Associa-
tion, and I am appearing here today on NSBA’s behalf as well. NSBA is a nonprofit
small  business  organization  that  serves  over  150,000  companies.  NSBA  is  the  Na-
tion’s oldest small business advocacy group and was the founder of the ‘‘small busi-
ness  movement’’  in  the  United  States.  It  celebrates  its  70th  anniversary  in  two
weeks.

Two  months  ago,  NSBA’s  biennial  ‘‘Small  Business  Congress’’  selected  the  reau-
thorization of the SBIR Program as one of the top four small business legislative pri-
orities for the 110th Congress—right behind taxes and health care.

Today, as the Subcommittee considers reauthorizing the SBIR Program, we would
like  to  offer  our  views  and  address  the  questions  that  the  Subcommittee  posed  of
us.
I. THE U.S. AS A GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY COMPETITOR

This  subcommittee,  as  well  as  the  Full  Science  and  Technology  Committee,  have
had  longstanding  concerns  about  our  nation’s  standing  as  a  global  leader  in  tech-
nology.  While  the  U.S.  currently  remains  the  acknowledged  front-runner  in  techno-
logical  innovation,  there  are  a  number  of  indications  that  our  global  leadership  is
in jeopardy.

Consider the status of U.S. technology products in international trade.1

While the overall pie has gotten bigger, the U.S. share has been cut in half.
A parallel development has been the shift of the United States from a technology-

exporting nation to an importing one.

Ten  years  ago,  the  U.S.  had  about  a  $30  billion  trade  surplus  in  high  technology
exports.  By  2005,  as  the  chart  below  shows,  that  had  fallen  precipitously  to  a  $45
billion trade deficit.2

These  trends  are  in  part  due  to  the  success  of  some  of  our  global  competitors  in
copying  U.S.  innovation-promotion  programs  like  SBIR,  the  Advanced  Technology
Program  (ATP)  and  the  Manufacturing  Extension  Program  (MEP).  SBIR  variants
are now in use in at least twenty countries. SBA reports that delegations from other
countries  appear  regularly  to  inquire  about  how  SBIR  is  organized  and  adminis-
tered.

Overall, many countries are more active than our own in targeting and promoting
innovation as a national economic strategy. So in addition to improving and expand-

ing  the  SBIR  program,  Congress  should  consider  strengthening  ATP  and  MEP.
Science  and  engineering  studies  at  our  high  schools  and  universities  should  be  en-
hanced, as well.

The declining shares of technology exports—and rising technology imports—by the
U.S.  also  represent  a  threat  to  economic  growth  at  the  regional  and  local  level,
where wealth creation is increasingly linked to the ownership of knowledge.

For  a  striking  illustration  of  this  relationship,  we  can  turn  to  a  recent  economic
study  by  Paul  Bauer,  Mark  Schweitzer  and  Scott  Shane.3 The  authors  measured
eight  determinants  of  personal  income  growth  per  capita,  in  the  48  contiguous
states  of  U.S.,  from  1939  to  2004.  (Each  determinant  had  been  highlighted  in  pre-
vious studies.) Among these were: the size of private financial markets, tax burdens,
public  infrastructure,  business  failure  rates,  industry  structure,  climate,  bank  de-
posits, and knowledge stocks.

By  far  the  most  important  growth  determinant  for  the  1939–2004  period  proved
to  be  knowledge  stocks.  For  this,  the  authors  used  three  indices:  high  school  and
college attainment rates, and patents per capita. Upon closer examination, the over-
whelmingly  dominant  indicator  of  income  growth  proved  to  be  patents  per  capita.
The chart4 below shows the power of this indicator in each of the 48 states stud-

ied:

Broadly speaking, the above chart can be read from left to right. States with lag-
ging growth are on the left; those with higher growth, on the right. The remarkable
aspect  of  the  patent  indicator  is  that  it  correlates  strongly  with  both  the  poorer
states  and  the  wealthier  ones—and  does  so  more  than  any  other  indicator.  A  lack
of patents per capita is a leading indicator of relative poverty; a profusion is strong-
ly associated with relative affluence.
Patents are more closely associated with economic growth than education,
industry structure, or any of the other variables tested.
The importance of patents is also well understood globally.5

II. CONSIDERATIONS FOR POLICY–MAKERS

a climate conducive to patenting?

The surprising answer is that Congress has already taken two of the most impor-
tant steps possible in promoting the growth of patents: First, by means of the Bayh-
Dole  Act,6 Congress  assured  innovators  that  they  could  maintain  control  of  the  in-
tellectual  property  that  they  developed  while  working  in  conjunction  with  the  Fed-
eral Government.

Second,  and  perhaps  most  important,  Congress  enacted  the  Small  Business  Inno-

vation Research Program in 1982, and has since reauthorized it five times.

All  of  this  leads  to  an  obvious  question:  what  can  policy-makers  do  to  encourage

SBIR—and  the  subsequent  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  (STTR)  Pro-
gram—put the creativity of technology-based small businesses to work in supplying
the  Federal  Government’s  technology  innovation  needs.  This  was  the  first  step  in
‘‘Unleashing American Innovation.’’

Competitive,  transparent,  and  focused,  SBIR  established  a  three-step  process  for
stimulating innovation that was aligned with the natural evolution of an innovation
through research and development to commercialization.

SBIR  Program  explicitly  recognizes  the  different  research  styles  and  capabilities
of large and small businesses.7 Phases I and II of SBIR are reserved for small busi-
ness.  In  the  commercialization  phase  of  SBIR,  Phase  III,  where  large  company  fi-
nancial  support,  manufacturing  expertise  and  marketing  muscle  is  vital,  such  com-
panies are welcomed into the Program. Indeed, they are indispensable to its success.
No innovation stimulation program in our nation’s history has received such high

marks from independent, third-party assessments.8

And  none  can  point  to  such  a  stellar  list  of  ‘‘graduates,’’  including:  Qualcomm,
Symantec, Amgen, Biogen, Genzyme, Chiron, Titan, Nanosys, American Biophysics,
Luna Innovations, JDS Uniphase, iRobot, and Armorworks, to name but a few.

SBIR has delivered not only innovations and new companies—but also patents.
Throughout  the  1980’s  and  early  1990’s  the  volume  of  patents  produced  by  SBIR
rose steadily. A tipping point came in 1997. For the first time, the number of SBIR-
related  patents  exceeded  the  number  of  university-related  patents.  Since  then,
SBIR’s lead has widened.
Today, the SBIR program is delivering about 50 percent more patents than
all  U.S.  universities  combined.  In  2006,  for  example,  there  were  4,588  patents
issued  to  SBIR-related  companies.  Just  over  2,900  patents  were  issued  to  Univer-
sities.9

Not  only  are  SBIR’s  patents  plentiful.  They  are  also  produced  very  efficiently  and

are exceptionally valuable.

• SBIR’s  vast  output  of  patents—which  now  exceeds  an  average  of  seven  pat-
ents  a  day,  and  has  surpassed  60,000  patents  over  the  life  of  the  program,
with  about  8,000  patents  pending—is  being  generated  on  one-twelfth  the
federal R&D funding that U.S. universities receive.10

• Overall,  smaller  companies  produce  about  13  times  more  patents  per  em-

ployee than large patenting firms.11

• These  small  company  patents  are  twice  as  likely  as  large  firm  patents  to  be
among  the  one  percent  most  cited  in  scientific  and  technical  literature  and
in subsequent patent applications.12

• And  small  firm  innovation  is  twice  as  closely  linked  to  current  scientific  re-
search as large company research, on average, and is thus substantially more
‘‘high tech’’ or ‘‘leading edge.’’ 13

For  scientists  and  engineers,  the  opportunity  to  own  this  valuable  intellectual
property  has  been  one  of  the  principal  attractions  of  working  in  a  small  company
setting. Indeed, so many scientists and engineers have migrated into smaller compa-
nies  in  recent  years  that  these  companies  now  have  the  Nation’s  largest  concentra-
tion of science and engineering talent.14

Put  differently,  over  half  the  scientists  and  engineers  in  the  private  sector  now

work for smaller companies.

Together, these statistics tell an important story. It’s this:

• Patents, and the technologies they represent, are strongly linked to both local

economic growth and global competitiveness.

• Awarding competitive federal R&D contracts to small, technology-based busi-
nesses, in a rigorous and disciplined manner like that used by the SBIR Pro-
gram, produces a very large number of high-quality patents.

But there’s one problem.
Only 4.3 percent of federal R&D dollars go to small companies—and the SBIR and

STTR Programs account for most of that.15

Overall, extramural federal R&D spending is highly concentrated. In FY 2005, at
the  National  Institutes  of  Health,  one  university  received  1299  awards,  valued  at
more than $600 million.16 This exceeds all SBIR awards at NIH in FY 2005.

The  same  situation  prevailed  at  DOD,  where  one  company’s  RDT&E  awards

greatly exceeded all SBIR awards.

In  fact,  RDT&E  awards  to  the  top  three  companies  at  DOD,  in  FY  2005  alone,
exceeded  every  dollar  that  has  been  spent  on  the  SBIR  Program—government-
wide—in the entire 25 year history of the Program.17
III. SBIR AND THE UNIVERSITIES

SBIR  and  STTR  make  an  important  contribution  in  another  way,  too.  The  Pro-
grams  offer  an  especially  important  venue  for  public-private,  and  nonprofit-private,
partnerships with Universities. SBIR researchers often have ties to universities, and
STTR  researchers  always  do.  In  my  own  two  companies,  I  have  used  researchers

Tech, Notre Dame, Ohio State, University of Alabama-Huntsville, University
of  California  Los  Angeles,  University  of  Michigan,  University  of  Southern
Florida,  University  of  Toledo,  and  Washington  University  in  St.  Louis.  We
have  also  partnered  on  projects  with  a  number  of  universities,  such  as  Colorado
State, the University of Utah and the University of Idaho. And we provide in-
ternships for about a dozen university students every year.

Together, SBIR/STTR companies and the Universities can:

• Identify University R&D with potential downstream commercial applications,

strengthening this awareness and focus,

• Develop new revenue streams for the Universities through R&D sales and li-

censing,

• Supplement  the  income  of  University-based  researchers  that  work  on  SBIR
and  STTR  projects,  thus  aiding  the  Universities  in  attracting  and  retaining
talented faculty,

• Expose  students  who  work  on  SBIR/STTR  projects,  or  intern  at  SBIR/STTR

companies, to the world of commercial R&D, and

• Jointly transfer valuable technology to the Nation as a whole.

But  there  is  an  even  more  important  reason  why  Universities  and  SBIR/STTR
companies are natural partners. Just as SBIR/STTR companies need the flow of sci-
entific  and  engineering  graduates  from  the  schools,  so  also  Universities  need  the
availability  of  attractive  yet  realistic  private  sector  job  opportunities  to  attract  stu-
dents in the first place. For many prospective science and engineering students, the
challenges,  relative  freedom,  and  upside  income  potential  of  working  in  a  leading-
edge small company will be exactly what they are seeking.

With  numerous  studies  suggesting  that  the  Nation  urgently  needs  to  graduate

The  trend  shown  below  is  especially  disturbing.  In  the  past  four  years,  the  num-
ber  of  degreed  scientist  and  engineers  in  the  U.S.  increased  by  less  than  20,000
graduates per year. India, by contrast, is graduating 78,000 more scientist and engi-
neers than four years ago—almost doubling their output.

IV. COMMERCIALIZATION OF SBIR TECHNOLOGIES

The  SBIR  Program  is  divided  into  three  Phases  that  correspond  to  the  research,
development, and commercialization of an innovation. Since the Program’s inception,
Phase  I  (initial  research)  and  Phase  II  (development  of  prototypes)  in  general  have
been handled well by the participating federal agencies.19,20

Where  SBIR  has  needed  improvement  is  in  the  commercialization  phase  (Phase
III).  Since  it  requires  agencies  to  either  find  outside  funding  to  commercialize  an
innovation, or to use non-SBIR agency funds to acquire the innovation for the agen-
cy  itself,  Phase  III  has  been  more  challenging  for  agencies  than  simply  using  SBIR
Phase I and Phase II to obtain desired R&D work.

Congress  focused  considerable  attention  on  SBIR  commercialization  in  the  2000
reauthorization.  Since  that  time  the  rate  of  commercialization  has  steadily  in-
creased.  As  part  of  the  SBIR  solicitation  process,  companies  must  report  their  rate
of success in commercialization, using published agency criteria. Today over 40 per-

cent  of  all  SBIR  technologies  reach  the  marketplace.  This  is  truly  a  remarkable  re-
sult.

And  thanks  to  commercialization  successes  in  some  units  within  the  Department
of  Defense,21 Congress  was  able  to  advance  Phase  III  broadly  within  DOD  under
legislation that was approved in 2006.

Called  the  Commercialization  Pilot  Program  (CPP),  the  new  law22 is  helping
bridge a gap between promising defense R&D and the mainstream DOD acquisition
system that has long been known colloquially as ‘‘the Valley of Death.’’

The  new  CPP  Program  suggests  ways  that  commercialization  might  be  improved

across the government.

While  the  CPP  has  only  been  in  place  at  DOD  only  since  2006,  it  has  greatly  in-
creased the focus on SBIR insertion in the DOD procurement process. Actions taken
by  key  officials  during  the  past  six  months  strongly  suggest  that  a  surge  of  SBIR
technology insertion is ahead in the next one to two years.
V. REPLIES TO QUESTIONS POSED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE.
1. SBIR Program effectiveness and recommendations.

The  SBIR/STTR  Programs  have  succeeded  in  the  goal  of  recruiting  smaller  tech-
nology-based companies to help address federal R&D needs. Over 16,000 companies
have  participated  in  the  SBIR  program,  and  over  6,000  are  currently  active  in  it.23
All  available  evidence  indicates  that  the  SBIR/STTR  Programs  are  working  as  well
as,  if  not  better  than,  other  federal  R&D  programs.  As  noted  above,  although  the
SBIR/STTR  programs  receive  about  one-twelfth  as  much  federal  R&D  funding  as
that  allocated  to  universities,24 SBIR  and  STTR  companies  generate  about  50  per-
cent more patents annually than all U.S. universities combined.25

It  would  be  hard  to  overstate  the  financial  significance  of  SBIR  /  STTR  to  small,
technology-based businesses. The Programs are by far the Nation’s largest source of
capital for early-stage R&D, particularly for high-risk projects.

over the time horizons that the companies would need for repayment.

It is not at all clear what would replace these Programs if they were to disappear.
• Banks  typically  will  not  lend  to  early-stage  technology  companies,  especially
• Smaller technology companies tend to be fueled by the dreams of their initial
owners and investors. These individuals resist yielding equity—especially con-
trolling equity—to venture capitalists and other ‘‘outsiders.’’ Even if the com-
panies welcomed such equity participation, it would be hard to find.
• Venture  capital  tends  to  cluster  in  specific  sectors  and  specific  geographical
areas;  relatively  little  of  it  is  available  for  early-stage  technology  firms  like
most  SBIR/STTR  firms,  particularly  those  outside  of  the  Boston  and  San
Francisco Bay areas.

Agency  flexibility.  Agencies  in  the  SBIR/STTR  programs  have  diverse  missions,
and have been given considerable flexibility by Congress in administering their pro-
grams.  SBTC  agrees  with  this  general  orientation.  However,  certain  basic  rules  do
need  to  be  observed  and  SBA  does  need  to  function  effectively  as  an  effective  Pro-
gram coordinator and impartial adjudicator.

Definition  of  a  small  business.  The  most  important  rule  for  the  program  is  that
participation  is  statutorily  limited  to  companies  with  fewer  that  500  employees,  in-
cluding  affiliates  and  subsidiaries.  This  requirement  is  derived  not  only  from
Congress’s  long-standing  mandate  that  a  small  business  must  be  one  that  is  ‘‘inde-
pendently owned and operated,’’ 26 but also from the need to avoid the ‘‘capture’’ by
larger enterprises of the resources that Congress intended for small business.

There  are  occasional  efforts  to  breach  SBIR’s  statutory  maximum  of  500  employ-
ees; doing so would undermine both the central purpose of the program and the key
ingredient of its success.

It is also appears totally unnecessary. If SBIR accounts for two and one-half per-
cent  of  extramural  federal  R&D,  then  the  other  ninety-seven  and  one-half  percent
is available for entities that are not small businesses.

Technologies developed by other agencies. An area where agency flexibility should
be continued and expanded is encouraging agencies to fund Phase II awards, or pro-
mote  the  Phase  III  commercializations  of  technology  initially  developed  by  other
agencies in the SBIR/STTR Programs. Overlapping agency missions in fields like de-
fense  and  homeland  security,  and  science  and  life  sciences,  suggest  that  agencies
should  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  technological  breakthroughs  in  any  part  of  the
SBIR/STTR  Programs.  This  type  of  sharing  is  in  the  public  interest  and  has  been
occurring for several years. Congress should encourage it.

SBA management. SBIR and STTR are critical national R&D programs providing
scarce dollars for early stage technologies of potentially great importance. The inter-
ests  of  the  taxpayers  in  assuring  the  effective  management  and  oversight  of  these
programs  and  these  dollars  must  be  respected.  SBA  needs  to  strengthen  its  Office
of  Technology  to  provide  this  guidance  and  leadership  to  the  participating  agen-
cies.27
Award levels. SBIR Phase I and Phase II award level sizes have not been adjusted
since  1992.  Inflation  and  other  cost  factors  in  the  intervening  years  have  made  an
upward revision necessary. At the same time, some agencies have simply ‘‘taken the
law in their own hands.’’ A GAO Report in 2005 found that more than half of NIH’s
SBIR awards in recent years exceeded the Program Guidelines agreed upon by Con-
gress,  SBA  and  OMB  and  published  in  the  Federal  Register.28 The  2006  Senate
Small  Business  and  Entrepreneurship  Committee  report  on  SBIR  reauthorization
cites a $6.5 million Phase II award by NIH.29 Such an award displaces almost seven
Phase  II  contracts  that  could  have  been  awarded  if  the  Congressionally  mandated
cap of $750,000 had been observed.

Congress  must  be  clear  about  this.  Either  SBIR/STTR  Programs  should  grow  by
several  orders  of  magnitude,  or  agencies  must  stop  using  the  Programs  as  ‘‘piggy
banks’’ to finance projects that should be funded from other agency sources.

SBTC  generally  agrees  with  the  award  size  revisions  contained  in  S.  3778  from
the last Congress, which was approved by the Senate Small Business and Entrepre-
neurship Committee. The Committee bill raised Phase I awards caps from $100,000
to $150,000 and Phase II award caps from $750,000 to $1,250,000. However, SBTC
would  caution  Congress  that  such  increases  in  the  caps  will  result  in  a  significant
reduction in the number of total SBIR awards (and therefore the number of compa-
nies participating in the Program) if overall SBIR dollars remain constant.

Depending  on  how  awards  were  distributed  between  Phase  I’s  and  Phase  II’s
within  each  agency,  as  many  as  40  percent  fewer  companies  could  end  up  in  the
SBIR Program. This could represent a devastating loss of technological talent to the
government. It is another compelling reason for increasing the percentage of federal
R&D allocated to SBIR/STTR.

26 This  legal  stipulation  has  been  included  in  the  Small  Business  Act  (15  USC  632)  since  the
Act was passed in 1953. It is the foundation of much subsequent small business law and a large
body of federal rules.

Committee, U.S. Senate, Small Business Reauthorization and improvements Act of 2006, Report
Number 109–361, p.46.

36

Of  course,  the  SBIR/STTR  dollar  level  might  not  remain  constant.  If  the  higher
levels  of  R&D  funding  recommended  by  the  President’s  Competitiveness  Initiative
were  to  be  so  allocated  by  Congress,  the  dollar  size  of  the  SBIR/STTR  Programs
would  grow  in  tandem.  But  this  is  difficult  to  predict,  and,  in  any  event,  future
years could just as easily witness a decline in federal R&D spending.

The Senate bill also anticipates an opportunity for agencies to ‘‘override’’ the caps
by  50  percent.  The  Phase  I  ‘‘override’’  would  be  $225,000;  the  Phase  II,  $1,875,000.
This  would  obviously  exacerbate  the  foregoing  problem.  SBTC  would  like  to  see
clear  conditions  imposed  on  the  agencies  for  any  such  ‘‘overrides.’’  But  again,  those
conditions  could  become  more  flexible  if  the  allocation  of  funds  going  to  the  SBIR
and STTR Programs is increased in the manner that we have recommended.
Commercialization funding gaps.  Perhaps  no  subject  is  more  important  for  this
reauthorization than the effective transitioning of technology from the working pro-
totype  stage  to  production  and  utilization  by  the  agencies  or  the  private  sector.
Agency efforts like NIH’s Phase IIB, NSF’s Phase II+, and DOD’s Commercialization
Pilot  Program  are  pointing  the  way.  Successes  like  those  experienced  by  the  Navy
show  that  such  transitioning  can  be  accomplished  in  ways  that  benefit  the  govern-
ment and the taxpayers. SBTC urges Congress to incentivize agencies to match the
successes  of  SBIR  Phases  I  and  II  in  SBIR  Phase  III.  One  key  to  this  will  be  the
expenditure of additional dollars on testing and evaluation.
Program administrative costs. SBTC  is  aware  that  strengthening  the  SBIR  and
STTR Programs in the ways we recommend will place additional administrative re-
sponsibilities  on  the  participating  agencies.  Although  SBTC  has  long  opposed  the
transfer  of  dollars  from  contract  awards  to  administrative  overhead,  we  would,  as
we  told  the  Senate  last  year,  consider  re-allocating  no  more  than  one  percent  of
SBIR’s  total  dollars  to  new  agency  administrative  costs.  We  recommend  that  this
funding  increment  be  used  strictly  for  strengthening  commercialization  of  SBIR
technologies,  and  that  agencies  be  required  to  report  on  how  any  expenditure  of
these funds directly supports this objective.
Venture capital company participation in the SBIR Program.

Background.  Since  the  SBIR  Program  is  intended  for  small  businesses,  Congress
made  it  a  part  of  the  Small  Business  Act  and  set  a  statutory  cap  of  500  employees
for participating companies.

The  Small  Business  Act  defines  a  small  business  as  one  that  is  ‘‘independently

owned and operated.’’ 30

Charged  with  implementing  this  mandate,31 SBA  promulgated  the  ‘‘affiliation
rule,’’ 32 which  states  that  in  determining  whether  a  business  is  small,  all  of  the
business’s subsidiaries and affiliates will be counted, including any company control-
ling, controlled by, or under the mutual control of, the business claiming to be small.
(Likewise,  under  the  commercial  codes  of  all  50  states,  a  firm  that  controls  more
than 50 percent of another company is treated as owning the company.)

This  legal  framework  has  not  been  challenged  in  over  half  a  century.  Tampering
with  it  would  set  legal  precedents  affecting  a  large  body  of  laws  and  regulations,
ranging from tax laws to small business lending to the regulations and procurement
policies affecting small businesses at dozens of federal agencies.

Under  the  SBIR  rules,  a  venture  capital  company  that  is  small  by  SBA’s  stand-
ards  may  hold  a  controlling  interest  in  an  SBIR  company,  as  long  as  the  combined
entity  is  still  small  and  is  owned  by  individuals.  A  venture  capital  company  that
is  large  by  that  standard  may  hold  a  minority  (less  than  50  percent)  interest  in  an
SBIR company. The only prohibition is on control of an SBIR company by a large
VC.

Current controversy. We are now in the fifth year, and third consecutive Congress,
that  elements  of  the  biotechnology  and  venture  capital  industries  have  petitioned
Congress and the Small Business Administration to override the SBA’s legal frame-
work for determining what is a small business.

The  focal  point  of  this  dispute  is  a  small  group  of  large-VC-controlled  firms  that
are seeking access to SBIR awards at the National Institutes of Health and perhaps
other agencies.

The  fact  that  the  firms  involved,  and  their  VC  backers,  have  spent  this  long  un-
successfully  promoting  these  changes  in  Congress  and  at  SBA  should  suggest  that
their arguments are far from persuasive when closely examined.

37

The  fact  that  the  firms  and  the  VCs  are  back  again  in  this  Congress  is  linked,
in  SBTC’s  view,  to  a  number  of  misleading  or  incorrect  assertions  about  the  issue.
We  looked  at  these  assertions  very  carefully  in  our  Senate  testimony  last  year;33

here we will simply summarize some of them.
1)  Let  us  start  with  the  most  emotional  assertion.  It  is  sometimes  stated  that  the
prohibition  on  SBIR  access  by  large  VC-controlled  firms  is  denying  patients  with
life-threatening diseases the ‘‘important, life-saving’’ medications they need. Various
patient groups, among others, have been told this.

The  simplest  and  most  logical  response  is  that  if  NIH  funds  proposals  by  these
large  venture-backed  companies,  then  other  ‘‘important,  life-saving’’  proposals  will
not be funded.

Most  proposals  that  NIH  considers  have  life-saving  implications.  Until  the  NIH
budget  is  large  enough  to  fund  every  proposal,  the  competitive  awards  process  will
always  yield  winners  and  losers.  For  their  part,  SBTC  members  that  are  active  in
the NIH SBIR Program also fear that their ‘‘important, life saving’’ innovations will
lose out—to the large venture-backed companies.

They may well have more to fear.
Thanks  to  their  deep-pocket  backing,  the  companies  that  the  VCs  fund  will  be
able  to  submit  multiple  proposals  per  solicitation.  They  won’t  necessarily  be  more
life-saving, but they will be more polished. They will also have features that do well
under NIH’s scoring system—like impressive looking ‘‘teams’’ and extensive prelimi-
nary research. It costs money to submit multiple proposals, to make them polished,
to keep impressive teams on hold until an award decision is reached, and to conduct
preliminary  research.  That  is  exactly  where  large  VC-backed  companies  will  have
the edge.

Proposals that won’t have that edge will be those from companies whose research
interests  don’t  fit  the  large  VC  business  model,  and  who  therefore  don’t  have  that
backing.  Examples  of  research  that  generally  doesn’t  fit  the  model  are  treatments
for orphan diseases, (which don’t generate a lot of cash flow), bioterrorism defenses
(only one buyer, the Federal Government), and vaccines (patients only take the drug
once,  not  daily).  Yet  a  key  reason  for  creating  NIH  was  to  address  public  health
challenges  such  as  these—challenges  that  are  often  outside  the  normal  commercial
nexus  of  medicine.  SBIR  should  support  that  mission,  not  attempt  to  distract  the
agency from it.

Whether or not large VCs are interested in such areas, small companies are.

2)  For  some  reason,  the  VCs  and  their  allies  continue  to  state  that  ‘‘SBA  changed
the  rules’’  on  them.  As  noted,  the  Small  Business  Act  and  the  affiliation  rule  are
more  than  50  years  old.  GAO  looked  at  this  ‘‘changed  the  rules’’  allegation  in  2006
and  correctly  stated  that  SBA  had  clarified  long-standing  rules.34 It  may  well  be
true that some large VC backed firms were obtaining SBIR awards prior to the clar-
ification;  it  does  not  mean  that  SBA,  having  had  that  fact  drawn  to  its  attention,
should  have  allowed  it  to  continue.  Nor  does  it  mean  that  the  large  VCs  now  have
some ‘‘right’’ to demand such treatment.
3)  Companies  and  associations  seeking  this  change  say  that  the  SBIR  Program  at
NIH will be strengthened by having the big VC backed companies in it.

The  problem  with  this  assertion  is  the  disconnect  between  Phases  I  &  II  as  they
are intended to work in the SBIR Program and what VCs prefer to fund. In VC ter-
minology,  Phase  I  represents  ‘‘seed  or  startup’’  R&D  and  Phase  II  ‘‘early  stage’’
R&D. Neither is much of a focus of VCs.

38

Seed capital currently accounts for a minuscule $3 out of every 100 that large VCs
invest,  and  early  stage  capital  only  16  percent.  A  large  VC  presence  in  the  NIH
SBIR  Program  seems  likely  to  inexorably  draw  the  Program  away  from  its  mission
to provide scarce R&D dollars for high-risk, early stage R&D.

There  is  another  problem  as  well.  Congress  intended  for  the  SBIR  Program  to
harvest innovations from across the country, even in areas not known as technology
centers.  That  is  why  the  Federal  and  State  Technology  (FAST)  Program  and  Rural
Outreach (RO) Program were developed by Congress as adjuncts to SBIR. They have
been  fairly  successful.  In  the  ‘‘best  practice’’  FAST  and  RO  state  programs,  more
than  one  out  of  every  three  companies  receiving  the  training  goes  on  to  obtain  an
SBIR award.

By  contrast,  venture  capital  investors  generally  operate  out  of  a  headquarters  in
a  technology  center  and  try  to  invest  in  companies  that  they  can  personally  visit
on  a  regular  basis.  This  is  perfectly  reasonable,  but  it  is  a  far  different  model  than
SBIR. The different outcomes can be seen in the contrasting distribution of dollars,
in the chart below.

39

So  apart  from  the  damage  that  the  intrusion  of  large  companies  would  do  to  the
integrity of SBIR as a small business program focused on very early-stage R&D, the
rise  of  large  VCs  in  the  SBIR  Program  will  shift  the  distribution  of  SBIR’s  dollars
more toward the relative handful of cities and states that the VCs focus on.

A SBIR Program that is not truly a small business program, and not truly

national, would soon be curtailed by Congress, and deservedly so.

There  is  a  vital  and  necessary  place  for  large  VCs  in  the  SBIR  Program.  It  is  in

Phase III.

Companies  entering  the  commercialization  phase  of  SBIR  urgently  need  to  part-
ner with outside investors—and this is precisely the stage of R&D development that
VCs  prefer  in  the  first  place.  Thus  neither  Congress  nor  SBA  sets  any  restrictions
on  the  size  of  companies  that  can  participate  in  Phase  III  of  SBIR.  If  this  does  not
meet the needs of large VCs, SBTC would be willing to work them to craft another
program that does—an offer we have made repeatedly over the years.

Now  would  be  a  good  opportunity  to  create  such  a  program.  It  could  be  tied  in
to the strengthening of ATP and MEP, two important innovation programs for com-
panies of all sizes that SBTC strongly supports.

But SBIR needs to stay focused on the core issue that we have outlined—that the
Nation  still  is  receiving  only  a  fraction  of  the  innovation  benefits  it  could—if  the
growing number and capabilities of small technology companies were better utilized.
Efforts to correct this problem should not lose their focus or become diluted.
VI. SBTC’S RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS

In my opinion, SBIR appears to be the most successful program that Congress has
ever  devised  to  stimulate  innovations;  now  is  the  time  to  expand  the  Program  and
make it permanent.

40

SBTC recommends that Congress:
1. Make the Program permanent. SBIR is the largest single source of patents in the
United  States.  It  has  stimulated  the  creation  of  thousands  of  successful  companies,
provided  the  Nation  with  a  host  of  vital  defense,  homeland  security,  and  life
sciences technologies, resulted in billions of dollars in economic activity, and created
tens  of  thousands  of  high-paying  jobs.  It  should  not  have  to  justify  its  existence
every  few  years.  Delays  in  Congressional  approval  of  reauthorization,  totally  unre-
lated  to  SBIR,  caused  the  Program  to  temporarily  shut  down  in  2000.  Uncertainty
about  its  future,  as  each  reauthorization  looms,  puts  thousands  of  jobs,  and  hun-
dreds of companies, in jeopardy. SBIR has proved its worth. Congress should make
it  permanent,  conduct  normal  cycles  of  Congressional  oversight  and  management
hearings, and make occasional adjustments as needed to the Program’s legal frame-
work.
2.  Increase  the  allocation  of  R&D  dollars  going  into  the  Program.  As  the  foregoing
data have shown, SBIR has become a vital contributor to the Nation’s technological
development and wealth creation. The Program leverages federal R&D resources in
uniquely efficient ways. Given the global competitive challenges faced by the United
States, SBIR should be given the resources to access America’s untapped innovation
resources. SBTC recommends that the SBIR share of federal R&D dollars be gradu-
ally  increased  from  today’s  two  and  one-half  percent  to  five  percent,  at  the  rate  of
.5 percent per year. At a five percent level, smaller companies would still be receiv-
ing less than one-sixth of the dollars that their numbers of scientists and engineers,
and  their  patent  production,  should  entitle  them  to.  Today  they  receive  less  than
one-seventh.

To further enhance cooperation between Universities and small, technology-based
companies,  SBTC  further  recommends  that  the  STTR  share  of  federal  R&D  dollars
be increased from the current 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent on FY 2008 and 0.9 percent
in FY 2009 and thereafter.
3. Strengthen commercialization of SBIR. SBTC suggests that Congress take several
new actions that will help ‘‘Unleash American Innovation.’’

First,  if  the  funding  for  SBIR  and  STTR  is  increased  as  suggested  above,  allow-
able Phase I and Phase II SBIR and STTR funding should be increased during 2008
and  2009  to  $150,000  for  Phase  I  and  $1,250,000  in  Phase  II,  and  indexed  to  infla-
tion,  to  allow  more  work  to  be  performed  under  the  initial  two  phases  of  the  pro-
gram.

Second,  starting  in  2009,  one  third  of  the  increased  funding  in  the  SBIR  and
STTR programs over the 2007 funding levels should be set aside for funding ‘‘Phase
2c’’ type initial manufacturing prototypes and testing by the agency and other com-
mercial clients or for clinical trials deemed important to the agency’s mission.

Third, a ‘‘CPP’’ type program should be formed in the NIH, NASA, and DOE. Ad-
ditional funding should be provided, and the Program opened up to companies that
have received VC funding from all sources.
4.  Reinforce  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  SBIR  companies.  In  a  recent  decision
involving  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  an  SBIR  company,  the  court  appeared
to  misinterpret  longstanding  Congressional  intent  on  the  issue.35 SBTC  would  like
to work with Congress in rectifying this problem.

We believe that these actions will allow more new companies to be formed, SBIR
and STTR companies to grow faster and larger, and encourage venture capital flows
to those SBIR companies that are ready to enter the next stage of their growth.

The  gap  in  funding  the  growing  number  of  innovative  small  companies,  and  the
scientific and technological innovators who work for them, has potentially important
consequences for the Nation. As Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson has noted about
IT companies:

Since  1995,  information  technology  industries  have  accounted  for  25  percent  of
overall  economic  growth,  while  making  up  only  three  percent  of  GDP.  As  a
group,  these  industries  contribute  more  to  economy-wide  productivity  than  all
other industries combined.36

BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBERT N. SCHMIDT

Mr. Robert N. Schmidt is the founder and Chairman of Cleveland Medical Devices
Inc.  and  of  Orbital  Research  Inc.,  both  of  which  were  started  in  1990.  He  received
his  BS  degree  in  Mechanical  Engineering  (70)  and  his  MS  (71)  from  Rensselaer
Polytechnic  Institute  in  Troy,  NY;  his  MBA  (75)  from  the  Univ.  of  Utah,  and  his
Juris Doctor (80) from Cleveland State University. He is a licensed professional en-
gineer (Ohio, 76) and an attorney (Ohio, 81 and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
82).

Both  Orbital  Research  and  Cleveland  Medical  Devices  have  experienced  extraor-
dinary growth over the last decade; both being named to the Inc. 500 list, and both
being  on  NE  Ohio’s  Weatherhead  100  list  at  least  seven  times.  Mr.  Schmidt  is  the
only  person  in  America  to  have  two  companies  named  on  the  Inc.  Inner  City  100
list,  and  both  companies  have  made  the  list  at  least  three  years  in  a  row.  Mr.
Schmidt  is  the  only  entrepreneur  to  have  received  this  Inc.  Inner  City  100  Award
from Harvard seven times in the seven years of its existence. Both companies have
been  bootstrapped  with  sales  generated  funding.  He  was  on  the  Inc.  500  Advisory
Board in 2002.

Both  Mr.  Schmidt  and  his  companies  have  also  been  recognized  for  their  innova-
tive technologies: Cleveland Medical Devices has received the NORTECH/EDI Inno-
vation  Award  four  times,  and  Orbital  Research  has  received  this  award  twice.  As
a  principal  investigator,  Mr.  Schmidt  has  supervised  programs  for  the  U.S.  Army,
Navy,  and  Air  Force,  DARPA,  the  National  Institutes  of  Health,  NASA,  Dept.  of
Education, Dept. of Transportation, and the National Science Foundation. The com-
panies have performed over $50 million of research for the U.S. Government.

Prior  to  starting  his  companies,  Mr.  Schmidt  was  a  consultant  to  the  Center  for
Materials  for  Space  Structures,  a  NASA  Center  at  Case  Western  Reserve  Univer-
sity.  He  coordinated  materials  space  flight  experiments  to  fly  on  the  Space  Shuttle
and  on  the  Wakeshield,  evaluating  the  effects  of  atomic  oxygen  and  the  low  Earth
environment  on  lighter  weight  polymers  and  ‘‘self-healing’’  materials.  From  1984  to
1990,  Mr.  Schmidt  served  as  Director  of  Technology  and  Program  Development  at
Life  Systems,  Inc.  He  managed  Functional  Electrical  Stimulation  (FES)  programs,
helping  paraplegics  to  walk,  and  other  medical  programs;  an  ‘‘Advanced  Collective
Protection Chemical Defense System,’’ and several other Army chemical defense pro-
grams;  and  the  ‘‘Zero-Gravity  Shower’’  program  and  several  other  hygiene  and  re-
generable  life  support  programs  for  the  Space  Station  Freedom;  as  well  as  working
on water recycling and regenerative fuel cell programs.

From 1976 to 1983, Mr. Schmidt was Manager of Licensing and Technology Devel-
opment,  an  Engineering  Manager,  a  Project  Control  Manager,  and  a  Project  Engi-
neer  for  Davy  McKee  Corporation.  He  was  responsible  for  technology  transfer  for
the  4,000-person  engineering  firm.  As  the  project  engineer  for  three  petrochemical
plants,  he  directed  engineering  efforts  and  controlled  programs  worth  up  to  $200
million  for  ARCO,  Exxon,  and  Shell  Oil.  He  was  the  chief  engineer  for  the  design
of the world’s largest single train methanol plant, and built a coal liquifaction plant
for Exxon. From 1972 to 1976, he was Chief of Engineering Plans for the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers in Stuttgart, West Germany, managing engineering efforts at 48
U.S. Military installations in southern Germany supervising over 800 projects.

Mr.  Schmidt  has  received  the  Edison  Biotechnology  Center  Award  for  Out-
standing  Contribution  to  Biotechnology  in  Ohio  in  1993,  is  a  Founding  member  of
the FES Society, and a member of the AIAA, IEEE, and SAE. He has published over
30  papers,  and  has  23  U.S.  patents  in  the  areas  of  medical  devices,  flight  control,
radio  design,  electrophysiology,  pressure  measurement,  chemical  defense,  and
Braille displays.

In his newest ventures, Mr. Schmidt serves as the Chairman of several other com-
panies  including  iACTIV  Corporation  and  ComSense  Technology  Inc.,  both  MEMS
companies;  and  of  RadioStorm  Inc.,  Flocel  Inc.,  and  CleveMed  NeuroWave  Inc.  He
is  also  the  founder  of  the  Americas’  Arts  and  Sciences  Foundation  and  of  NEOBio;
and is an angel investor in several non-related Cleveland area companies. He is on
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Business Advisory Council, and has been the
Keynote speaker for the Society of Manufacturing Engineers and an invited Speaker
to  the  American  Institute  for  Medical  and  Biological  Engineering.  He  was  named
by  The  National  Small  Business  Association  (NSBA)  as  the  2006  Small  Business
Advocate  of  the  Year  for  his  national  and  state  work  promoting  policies  to  help
small  business  prosper  (Money  Magazine,  p.50  12/05,  and  p.136  5/06);  and  is  one
of  only  of  handful  of  individuals  in  America  to  have  received  the  Inc.  500  Award
as  one  of  the  500  fastest  growing  companies  in  the  U.S.  as  CEO  for  more  than  one
company (CleveMed 2000 and Orbital Research 2001).

McGarrity.
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  GERARD  J.  McGARRITY,  EXECUTIVE  VICE
PRESIDENT  OF  SCIENTIFIC  AND  CLINICAL  AFFAIRS,
VIRxSYS CORPORATION
Dr.  MCGARRITY.  Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and
Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  my  name  is  Dr.  Gary  McGarrity,
Executive Vice President at VIRxSYS, a private biotechnology com-
pany  developing  treatment  for  HIV  and  for  vaccines.  Our  lead
product is a cutting-edge gene therapy technology against HIV and
has completed Phase I safety trials and is presently in Phase II ef-
ficacy trials.

Previously I was CEO of Intronn, Inc., and I have 30 years of ex-
perience  in  biotechnology  companies  and  biomedical  research,  in-
cluding  chairing  the  recompetent  DNA  Advisory  Committee  at  the
NIH.

I  am  testifying  today  for  BIO,  the  Biotechnology  Industry  Asso-
ciation which represents more than 1,100 biotechnology companies,
academic  institutions  and  other  organizations  in  all  50  states.  The
vast  majority  of  BIO  members  are  small,  early-stage  R&D  compa-
nies  just  like  mine.  BIO  has  over  600  emerging  technology  compa-
nies,  most  with  fewer  than  50  employees  that  do  not  have  a  mar-
keted product.

Biotechnology  research  follows  a  long,  unpredictable  road  from
pre-clinical research to FDA approval, an average about eight years
and  upwards  of  $800  million  to  $1.2  billion.  Without  product  reve-
nues,  companies  must  undertake  fundraising  from  angel  investors
and  venture  capital  firms.  Private  equity  fundraising  is  absolutely
critical to the development of new therapies.

My company started in 1998 using technology out of Johns Hop-
kins. We began our clinical trials five years later, and if we get all
of this correct, we will have a marketable product in 2010 or 2011.
In  addition,  we,  like  most  companies,  are  working  on  three  to  four
other products that are at a very, very early stage of development.
A  biotechnology  company  requires  extensive  fundraising  for  its
lead  product,  and  these  funds  are  tied  to  very  specific  milestones
for  their  product,  not  for  other  programs  that  may  be  at  earlier
stages.  Researching  other  therapies  typically  requires  different
funding  sources  which  is  particularly  challenging  at  the  very  ear-
liest  stages  of  development  as  you  have  stated  today,  Chairman
Wu.

Congress  created  the  SBIR  Program  to  utilize  the  capabilities  of
innovative  companies  to  fulfill  federal  R&D  needs,  and  they  pro-
vided discretion to the SBA to determine eligibility of small domes-
tic  companies.  SBIR  grants  were  never  intended  to  prop  up  small
businesses  through  corporate  welfare  but  instead  represent  a  com-
petitive grant program stressing innovation.

For  20  years,  small  domestic  biotechnology  companies  competed
for  SBIR  grants  based  on  scientific  merit  through  a  peer  review
process.  Obtaining  these  grants  was  a  powerful  signal  to  the  pri-
vate sector that the company’s research was compelling.

The  SBIR  Program  has  played  a  pivotal  role  in  advancing  new
treatments.  For  example,  of  the  163  companies  and  their  affiliates

that  have  been  involved  in  the  development  of  252  FDA-approved
biologics, 32 percent, one in three, have received at least one SBIR
STTR  grant.  That  is  an  impressive  statistic.  I  mean,  the  system
was working. Now, however, many biotech companies are excluded
from  competing  for  SBIR’s.  In  2003,  the  SBA  ruled  that  a  bio-
technology  firm  was  not  eligible  for  the  SBIR  program  because  of
its  capital  structure  based  on  a  new  view  of  SBA  regulations  but
not  a  change  in  underlying  statute  or  Congressional  intent.  SBA
has stated that the so-called ownership rule is meant to be a proxy
for determining that a company is domestic. However, this has had
the  unintentional  consequence  of  excluding  many  small  domestic
biotech companies from the SBIR program.

My  company,  VIRxSYS,  is  actually  eligible  to  compete  for  SBIR
grants. So I have led companies that have been eligible and compa-
nies that have not been eligible.

When I was CEO of Intronn, we successfully competed for Phase
I  and  Phase  II  SBIR  grants  in  cystic  fibrosis.  In  the  summer  of
2003, after being awarded the second Phase II SBIR grant in cystic
fibrosis  that  ultimately  would  have  led  to  clinical  trials,  our  grant
was rescinded because of the SBA rule change. The company’s pre-
vious  SBIR  grant  resulted  in  getting  venture  capital  investment
into  the  company  which  made  us  no  longer  eligible  for  SBIR’s.  We
had  20  employees  at  the  time.  We  terminated  promising  research
in cystic fibrosis, and we laid off employees. And this is not an iso-
lated incident.

Excluding  companies  from  the  SBIR  program  because  of  their
capital  structure  could  benefit  still  eligible  companies 
like
VIRxSYS  by  reducing  highly  qualified  applicants.  But  the  SBIR
program would be less competitive, and science itself would suffer.
Since  the  new  rule  was  implemented,  applications  for  SBIR
grants  declined  by  almost  12  percent  at  the  NIH  in  2005  and  by
14.6 percent in 2006. NIH director, Dr. Zerhouni, stated in a letter
to  the  SBA,  ‘‘NIH  believes  the  current  rule  undermines  the  statu-
tory purposes of the SBIR program. It undermines NIH’s ability to
award  SBIR  funds  to  those  applicants  whom  we  believe  are  most
likely  to  improve  human  health.’’  And  I  would  like  to  submit  this
letter for the record.

I  am  perfectly  willing  to  compete  with  small  domestic  biotech
companies  regardless  of  their  capital  structure  based  on  the  sci-
entific  and  the  technical  merit  of  our  research.  That  is  the  Amer-
ican  way.  I  respectfully  request  that  the  Committee  act  to  allow
small domestic companies to compete for SBIR grants regardless of
capital  structure.  SBIR  should  be  a  competitive  program  that  ful-
fills  federal  R&D  needs.  Funding  highly  qualified  research  should
be the priority, not corporate welfare.

Again, thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify here

this afternoon.

twenty years the SBIR program has served as a platform by which innovative, small
companies can compete to participate in federal research and development.

My  name  is  Dr.  Gary  McGarrity,  I  am  the  Executive  Vice  President  of  Scientific
and Clinical Affairs at VIRxSYS. VIRxSYS is a private biotech company whose mis-
sion is to develop gene therapies using its proprietary lentiviral vector delivery sys-
tem.  We  have  completed  Phase  I  safety  testing  and  are  now  in  Phase  II  clinical
trials  testing  the  first  application  of  our  gene  therapy  technology  against  HIV.  I
have  16  years  experience  with  biotech  companies  and  an  additional  14  years  of  in-
depth  scientific  experience.  Prior  to  joining  VIRxSYS,  I  was  the  CEO  of  Intronn,
Inc., which developed products to fight cystic fibrosis.

I am testifying today on behalf of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO),
an  organization  representing  more  than  1,100  biotechnology  companies,  academic
institutions,  state  biotechnology  centers  and  related  organizations  in  50  U.S.  states
and  31  other  nations.  BIO  members  are  involved  in  the  research  and  development
of  health  care,  agricultural,  industrial,  and  environmental  biotechnology  products.
The  overwhelming  majority  of  BIO  member  companies  are  small,  early  stage  re-
search and development oriented companies pursuing innovations that have the po-
tential  to  improve  human  health,  expand  our  food  supply,  and  provide  new  sources
of energy.
Biotechnology Companies’ Aggressive Capital Needs

The  largest  obstacle  to  delivering  on  the  scientific  promise  of  biotechnology  is  ac-
cessing  sufficient  capital  to  fund  research  and  development.  BIO  has  over  600
emerging companies in its membership that have fewer than 350 employees and do
not  yet  have  a  product  on  the  market.  In  the  absence  of  product  revenue,  bio-
technology  companies  are  almost  entirely  reliant  on  the  capital  markets  or  other
sources of non-dilutive financing to fund research and development. This is particu-
larly  challenging  at  the  earliest,  highest-risk  stages  of  research  and  development.
Promising  biotechnology  research  has  a  long,  arduous  road  from  preclinical  re-
search, through Phase I, safety, Phase II, efficacy, and Phase III broader population
clinical  trials,  and  ultimately  to  FDA  approval  of  a  therapy.  It  is  estimated  that  it
takes  97.7  months,  or  eight  years  to  bring  a  biotechnology  therapy  to  market  and
costs between $800 million and $1.2 billion.1 For the majority of biotechnology com-
panies  that  are  without  any  product  revenue,  the  significant  capital  requirements
necessitate  fund-raising  through  a  combination  of  angel  investors  and  venture  cap-
ital  firms.  The  role  and  importance  of  private  equity  fund-raising  in  the  bio-
technology industry cannot be understated.

Typically, a biotechnology company will begin by fund-raising for its lead product
in development. The lead product is the one that is furthest along in clinical devel-
opment, in the case of VIRxSYS our lead product is VRX496, which as I previously
stated,  is  in  Phase  II  clinical  trials.  To  get  to  this  point  we  undertook  five  rounds
of private fund-raising.

Biotechnology companies are generally a collection of research projects that range
from  early  to  very-early  stage  development.  In  addition  to  the  lead  therapy  bio-
technology companies have, on average, five other therapies or candidates in devel-
opment,  which  are  often  at  the  very  earliest  stage  of  pre-clinical  research.  These
candidates  may  be  an  outgrowth  of  research  on  the  lead  product  or  a  result  of  uti-
lizing  a  particular  technology  to  address  a  different  disease  with  a  completely  dif-
ferent set of intellectual property.

Despite  the  extensive  fund-raising  that  a  biotechnology  company  undertakes  for
the  lead  product,  these  funds  are  not  interchangeable,  that  is  they  are  often  tied
to  very  specific  milestones  to  support  the  lead  the  product’s  development.  As  such,
in order to develop secondary or tertiary candidates/therapies a company has to find
secondary sources of fund-raising capital. At the very earliest stages of development
this is particularly challenging, and it is often times in this capacity that the SBIR
grants  were  instrumental  in  advancing  research  and  development  in  biotechnology
for over twenty years.
Critical Role of the SBIR Program

Congress  created  the  SBIR  grant  program  in  order  to  utilize  the  capabilities  of
small,  innovative,  domestic  companies  to  fulfill  federal  research  and  development
needs. In the early 1980’s there was growing concern that the United States federal
research  and  development  spending  was  not  improving  the  health  and  well  being
of the citizenry through the development and commercialization of new products and
therapies. Furthermore, it was recognized that some early stage, promising scientific

research failed to be funded through the markets because it was viewed as too high
risk. This failure of the markets is often referred to as the ‘‘valley of death.’’ In bio-
technology, the ‘‘valley of death’’ delays potential therapies for HIV, cancer, and in-
fectious  diseases  from  reaching  patients,  who  often  lack  other  comparable  alter-
natives.

For  these  reasons,  in  1983  Congress  authorized  the  SBIR  grant  program.  These
grants  set  aside  2.5  percent  of  certain  departments’  and  agencies’  extramural  re-
search  budgets  for  innovative  research  grants  with  an  aim  towards  commercializa-
tion. One of the great strengths of the SBIR program is that Congress provided the
affected  departments  and  agencies  with  flexibility  in  establishing  the  program.  As
a  result,  the  SBIR  program  both  assists  the  Department  of  Defense  in  its  procure-
ment  needs  and  furthers  the  National  Institutes  of  Health’s  (NIH’s)  mission  of  ad-
vancing science and improving health.

In order to participate in the program, Congress provided discretion to the Small
Business  Administration  (SBA)  to  determine  the  definition  of  a  qualifying  small
business  concern  (SBC).  However,  the  Congress  did  make  clear  that  the  program
should be open only to domestic, small companies. In order to be awarded an SBIR
grant,  an  applicant’s  research  is  thoroughly  examined  through  peer  reviewed  re-
search  groups  that  are  comprised  of  experts  in  the  particular  field.  It  should  be
made clear that the SBIR program was never intended to prop up small businesses
through corporate welfare, but instead its mission is to fund competitive and innova-
tive research in small, domestic companies with the goal of commercializing a prod-
uct.

There are two SBIR grant phases. Phase I grants are for proof of concept or tech-
nical merit. These grants are typically no greater than $100,000 although the grant-
ing agency does have some flexibility to fund awards that exceed this amount. Com-
panies  that  successfully  complete  a  Phase  I  grant  can  apply  for  a  Phase  II  grant.
A  Phase  II  application  is  evaluated  again  on  the  science  and  technical  merit  and
feasibility as well as the commercialization potential, as evidenced by private sector,
non-SBIR  funding  commitments.  Phase  II  awards  are  typically  no  greater  than
$750,000,  but  again,  agencies  have  some  flexibility  to  fund  awards  at  a  higher
amount.  This  flexibility  should  be  maintained  because  it  allows  expert  peer  review
groups to adequately fund awards where merited by the science.
Unintended Consequences of the SBA’s Domestic Company Proxy

For  twenty  years  small,  domestic  biotechnology  companies  competed  for  SBIR
grants.  In  addition  to  providing  non-equity  diluting  funding,  these  grants  were  a
powerful signal to the private sector that a company’s research was compelling and
possessed  scientific  and  technical  merit.  In  biotechnology,  the  SBIR  program  has
played  a  role  in  advancing  the  science  and  research  of  companies  that  have  ulti-
mately brought a product to market. For example, there are 163 companies and af-
filiates  involved  in  the  development  of  the  252  FDA  approved  biologics,  32  percent
of those companies and affiliates have received at least one SBIR/STTR award.

However,  today  most  biotechnology  companies  are  excluded  from  participating  in
the  SBIR  program  as  a  result  of  a  SBA  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (OHA)  rul-
ing. On April 7, 2003, the SBA arbitrarily ruled that a biotechnology firm, Cognetix,
did  not  meet  the  SBIR  size  standard  because  it  had  venture  capital  investment  in
excess  of  50  percent.  This  ruling  is  based  upon  SBA  regulations,  not  underlying
statue,  by  which  a  small  business  concern  (SBC)  for  the  SBIR  program  is  defined
as having fewer than 500 employees, including affiliates, and is at least 51 percent
owned by U.S. citizens.

SBA  has  stated  that  the  ownership  rule  is  meant  to  be  a  proxy  for  determining
that a company is domestic.2 However, the use of capital structure as proxy for de-
termining  domesticity  and  the  subsequent  OHA  ruling  has  the  unintentional  con-
sequence  of  excluding  a  sizable  portion  of  the  biotechnology  industry  that  would  be
otherwise eligible to participate in the program. These are companies that are solely
based  in  the  United  States  and  are  majority  funded  through  a  combination  of  U.S.
based venture capital companies and citizens.

VIRxSYS is a unique biotechnology company because the five rounds of fund-rais-
ing that the company has undergone have been financed through more than 600 pri-
vate  individuals.  VIRxSYS  is  eligible  for  applying  for  an  SBIR  grant.  However,  I
have led both an SBIR-eligible and a non-eligible biotechnology company.

Intronn, Inc., where I was formerly CEO, successfully applied for a Phase I SBIR
grant in the area of cystic fibrosis. After meeting the objectives of the Phase I grant,
Intronn, Inc. applied for and was granted a Phase II grant. This funding continued

the purposes of the SBIR program.

to  advance  the  research  in  cystic  fibrosis  and  as  a  result  Intronn,  Inc.’s  work  was
published on the cover of the Nature Biotechnology journal. In the summer of 2003,
Intronn,  Inc.  successfully  applied  for  a  second  Phase  II  SBIR  grant  to  determine  if
the candidate was appropriate for Phase I clinical trials.

However,  Intronn,  Inc.  never  was  able  to  use  this  award  because  several  months
later  NIH  requested  information  on  the  capital  structure  of  the  company.  As  a  re-
sult  of  the  previous  success  with  SBIR  awards,  the  company  had  attracted  venture
capital investment, which made us no longer eligible, despite the fact that we were
clearly  a  small,  domestic  company  at  the  time  of  the  award.  The  award  was  re-
scinded; we closed down this promising research into Cystic Fibrosis, which was also
funded  by  the  Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation,  and  laid  off  employees.  Based  upon  the
reports  of  other  small  biotechnology  companies,  Intronn,  Inc.’s  experience  of  having
to abandon promising science is, by no means, an isolated incidence.

Arguably, excluding companies from the SBIR program solely on the basis of their
capital  structure  could  benefit  still  eligible  companies  like  VIRxSYS.  Yet  it  does  so
by making the program less competitive. As evidence of the impact of the new rules
on  biotech  and  medical  device  companies,  applications  for  SBIR  grants  at  the  NIH
declined  by  11.9  percent  in  2005  and  by  14.6  percent  in  2006.3 As  the  Director  of
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr. Elias Zerhouni, wrote in a letter to SBA
Administrator  Barreto  dated  June  28,  2005:  ‘‘NIH  believes  that  the  current  rule  un-
dermines the statutory purposes of the SBIR program. . . It undermines NIH’s abil-
ity to award SBIR funds to those applicants whom we believe are most likely to im-
prove  human  health.’’  (emphasis  added)  I  would  like  to  submit  this  letter  for  the
record.

A  recent  survey  of  small  biotech  companies  found  that  50  percent  are  ineligible
for the SBIR program because of their capital structure. Additionally, 85 percent of
the  companies  surveyed  said  that  if  the  rules  were  changed  to  allow  them  to  apply
for these grants they would do so.4 These companies are researching and developing
therapies for diabetes, Alzheimer’s, lupus and leukemia, among others diseases.

I  am  willing  to  compete  with  small,  domestic,  majority-backed  venture  capital
companies  for  SBIR  grants  based  on  the  scientific  and  technical  merit  of  VIRxSYS
research.  That’s  the  American  way.  I  respectfully  request  that  should  the  Sub-
committee  reauthorize  the  SBIR  program,  that  it  allow  domestic,  small  companies
to  compete  for  SBIR  grants  regardless  of  its  capital  structure.  SBIR  should  be  a
competitive  program  that  fulfills  federal  research  and  development  needs  while  ad-
dressing  a  failure  in  the  market  system.  It  is  not  meant  to  repeatedly  be  a  source
of corporate welfare but instead should fund highly qualified research.

Again, thank you for providing me with the opportunity to testify today before the

Subcommittee.

STATEMENT OF MR. ANTHONY R. IGNAGNI, PRESIDENT AND

CEO, SYNAPSE BIOMEDICAL, INC.

50

Mr.  IGNAGNI.  Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  Mr.
Mitchell,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  before  you  today  on
SBIR grants and the reauthorization of the program.

My  name  is  Anthony  Ignagni,  and  I  am  the  Founder  and  Presi-
dent  and  CEO  of  Synapse  Biomedical,  a  start-up  medical  device
company located in Oberlin, Ohio, established with the mission for
commercializing 
life-changing,  minimally-invasive,  neuro-stimu-
lating devices.

Today I am here to testify on behalf of the Medical Device Manu-
facturers  Association,  a  national  organization  representing  the  in-
novative entrepreneurial sector of the medical technology industry.
Our mission is to ensure that patients have access to the latest ad-
vancements in medical technology, most of which are developed by
small  research-driven  medical  device  companies  such  as  Synapse.
Synapse was founded four and one-half years ago based on tech-
nology  developed  at  Case  Western  Reserve  University  and  Univer-
sity  Hospitals  of  Cleveland.  We  have  pioneered  the  innovative  use
of  standard  laparoscopic  techniques  to  provide  a  low-risk  alter-
native  to  mechanical  ventilation,  and  people  with  spinal  cord  inju-
ries,  such  as  our  third  patient,  Christopher  Reeve.  We  have  also
applied  this  technology  in  people  with  a  devastating  disease  such
as ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. With our 56th patient
just implanted yesterday, we have a 97 percent success rate in the
spinal cord population.

We  have  evidence  that  this  technology  not  only  works  but  saves
healthcare costs and is life saving. One of our patients was able to
save  $13,000  per  month  in  Ohio  Medicaid  costs  by  weaning  off  of
a  ventilator  and  moving  from  the  vent  support  ward  to  a  non-vent
support ward one hallway over. He was recently married and is an
advocate for people now living with spinal cord injury.

Synapse  is  a  small  business.  We  have  nine  employees  and  the
sponsor  of  two  pivotal  device  trials.  I  have  raised  $6.5  million  to
fund these activities, and most importantly, those dollars enable us
to commit the resources necessary for 100 patient ALS pivotal trial.
As indicated in my disclosure statement, we currently exchanged
almost 49 percent of the company’s equity to venture and other in-
stitutional  investors  to  raise  that  money.  We  have  retained  just  a
little  over  51  percent  of  the  ownership  with  the  founders,  employ-
ees, initial, individual angel investors.

As  you  have  heard  today,  the  SBIR  program  was  established  in
1982 to offer competition-based awards to small private-sector busi-
nesses such as mine to stimulate technological innovation with the
intention  that  the  small  business  will  take  the  product  through  to
commercialization.  Synapse’s  involvement  in  the  SBIR  Program
has  provided  important  support  for  continued  innovation  of  our
technology  platform.  Our  ability  to  participate  in  the  program  pro-
vides the R&D funds to continue these efforts. Without these funds,
we  could  not  support  the  manpower  to  apply  the  continuing  ad-
vancement of our platform in these areas.

I am here today because the Committee has asked me to address
ways in which the SBIR program could be improved. As I noted be-
fore, under the strict eligibility rules, Synapse is on the cusp of be-

coming ineligible to apply for a SBIR grant due to the fact that ad-
ditional  institutional  investments  would  put  us  below  the  51  per-
cent  individual  ownership.  Our  situation  is  one  that  is  also  faced
by  a  majority  of  companies  in  the  medical  device  industry  as  evi-
denced  in  part  by  the  decline  of  applications  that  have  been  re-
ceived since the 2003 rule change.

Some  suggestions  that  I  believe  would  make  the  program  more
effective  in  achieving  its  goals  and  therefore  be  improved  include
first, increasing the dollar amount of the Phase I and II awards as
they have not changed since 1992 but maintain these as guidelines,
not as caps. Two, providing the agencies with more flexibility in ad-
ministering the SBIR Program, and third, returning to the previous
policy  before  the  2003  rule  change  so  that  all  companies  can  have
an  equal  chance  at  participating  in  the  federal  grant  process.  This
would mean that allowing some companies that are majority owned
by multiple VCs to participate in the program.

To  elaborate  on  these  recommendations,  I  believe  that  it  would
benefit the small businesses that apply for the grants if the Phase
I  award  could  be  raised  to  $150,000  and  Phase  II  increased  to
$1.25  million.  I  also  believe  there  are  opportunities  to  improve  the
program by providing agencies with more administrative flexibility.
MDMA  and  those  of  us  in  the  industry  would  agree  that  it  would
be  appropriate  to  allow  two  to  four  percent  of  the  funds  to  pay  for
administrative and assistance activities.

Further,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  remove  the  requirement  that
a company must have applied for a Phase I grant in order to apply
for Phase II. Under the current rules, only companies that have ap-
plied for and received Phase I SBIR grants are eligible to apply for
Phase  II.  If  this  rule  were  changed,  I  believe  more  small  business
participation in the SBIR program would occur.

Finally,  my  greatest  concern  pertaining  to  the  viability  of  the
program  is  the  need  to  increase  participation  of  all  innovative
small  businesses  in  federal  research  and  development,  including
those  with  venture  backing.  The  SBIR  Program  as  originally  de-
signed  did  this,  but  its  effectiveness  is  being  hampered  by  the  fact
that  many  small  businesses  are  deemed  ineligible  to  participate
based on their financing structure. The stimulation and sustaining
of  technological  innovation  will  only  be  met  if  all  companies,  re-
gardless  of  how  they  are  financed,  are  able  to  apply  for  SBIR
grants.  If  agencies  have  the  flexibility  they  need  to  administer  the
program  according  to  their  needs  and  the  needs  of  the  small  busi-
ness  community  and  the  dollar  amount  of  the  individual  awards
are increased to reflect inflationary adjustment.

Thank you for providing me this opportunity to testify.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANTHONY R. IGNAGNI

Chairman Wu, Ranking Member Gingrey and Members of the Technology and In-

novation Subcommittee:

Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  before  you  today  on  Small  Business  Innova-

tion Research (SBIR) grants and the reauthorization of the program.

My name is Anthony Ignagni and I am the President and Chief Executive Officer
of  Synapse  Biomedical,  Inc.  Synapse  Biomedical  is  a  privately-held  medical  device
company  located  in  Oberlin,  Ohio.  We  are  a  startup  company  established  with  the
mission  of  developing,  manufacturing,  selling  and  supporting  life  changing  mini-

is 

Founded 

mally invasive neurostimulation devices used in the diagnosis and treatment of per-
sons with neurological impairment.

in  September  2002,  Synapse’s  product  portfolio 

focused  on
neurostimulation  devices  for  minimally  invasive  surgical  interventions  and  res-
piratory assist. These two areas of medical specialization have come together in our
first  product,  the  NeuRΧ Diaphragm  Pacing  Stimulation  (DPS)  System.  The  found-
ers  of  the  Company  have  pioneered  the  innovative  use  of  standard  minimally
invasive  laparoscopic  techniques  to  provide  ventilation  in  persons  with  respiratory
muscle  paralysis.  This  technological  advance  provides  a  device  that  is  a  low-risk,
low-cost alternative to a very invasive procedure that has been performed for thirty-
five years.

I  am  pleased  to  tell  you  that  our  current  percutaneous  technology  has  been  suc-
cessful  in  over  fifty  patients  including  the  late  Christopher  Reeve  (our  third  im-
planted  patient).  Our  technology  has  demonstrated  clinical  promise  in  the  pilot  se-
ries  of  Amyotrophic  Lateral  Sclerosis  (ALS,  commonly  known  as  Lou  Gehrig’s  dis-
ease)  patients.  The  longest  implanted  patient  has  used  the  device  for  full-time  res-
piratory support for over six years. We additionally have evidence of this technology
saving  health  care  costs  and  potentially  saving  lives.  Our  fourth  patient  implanted
was able to save $13,000 per month in Ohio Medicaid costs by weaning off of a ven-
tilator, moving to a non-ventilator support ward in the nursing home he was in, and
then was able to move back home with his elderly mother. He has recently married
and is an advocate for people with spinal cord injury on the board of local hospitals.
We  also  have  had  several  implanted  patients  in  the  hurricane  affected  areas  of
the  South.  One  young  woman  specifically  lost  her  home  in  Hurricane  Rita  and  had
to  go  to  a  shelter.  Fortunately  she  had  been  already  fully  weaned  off  of  her  venti-
lator  and  was  able  to  sustain  extended  periods  without  power  as  our  device  lasts
several weeks on a single replaceable battery. These are just two of the many stories
that demonstrate the compelling benefit of our technology.

The  NeuRΧ DPS  System  is  currently  being  studied  in  two  human  clinical  trials.
The  first  trial  of  chronic  diaphragm  pacing  has  demonstrated  clinical  efficacy  as  a
ventilator replacement in chronic respiratory insufficiency with a 97 percent success
rate  in  providing  ventilatory  support.  The  second  ongoing  clinical  trial  is  for  dia-
phragm  conditioning  stimulation  to  improve  the  survival  time  in  ALS,  which  has
shown  a  preliminary  15  to  20  month  survival  benefit  in  the  pilot  series.  Additional
feasibility studies have begun to demonstrate the therapeutic implementation of dia-
phragm  stimulation  in  an  acute  ventilatory  assist  trial  intended  to  demonstrate  re-
duction in ventilator associated risks, improvements in cardiovascular function, and
reduced length of stay in intensive care units. Synapse is at the forefront of the pio-
neering  use  of  Natural  Orifice  Translumenal  Endoscopic  Surgery  (NOTES)  for  our
clinically  recognized  efforts  as  the  seminal  application  for  acute  ventilatory  assist.
Additional trials are planned, beyond the diaphragm, to demonstrate the feasibility
of the technology platform in two active research areas of Synapse’s founders: chron-
ic  abdominal  pain  and  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease.  So,  as  you  can  see  we  are
working  on  very  promising  and  life  enhancing  technology  which  serves  a  very  nar-
row patient population.

Today,  I  am  here  to  testify  on  behalf  of  the  Medical  Device  Manufacturers  Asso-
ciation  (MDMA),  a  national  organization  representing  the  innovative,  entrepre-
neurial sector of the medical technology industry. MDMA’s mission is to ensure that
patients  have  access  to  the  latest  advancements  in  medical  technology,  most  of
which are developed by small, research-driven medical device companies.

As  a  representative  of  the  medical  device  industry,  I  thank  you  for  allowing  me
to  share  with  you  my  experience  in  applying  for  and  obtaining  a  SBIR  grant.  As
you  know,  the  SBIR  program  was  established  in  1982  to  offer  competition-based
awards  to  small  private-sector  businesses  (such  as  mine)  to  stimulate  technological
innovation with the intention that the small business will take the product through
to  commercialization,  all  the  while  helping  to  stimulate  U.S.  economic  growth  and
international  competitiveness.  The  grant  making  process  is  structured  into  three
phases:

• Phase  I  is  the  feasibility  study  in  which  award  winners  undertake  a  limited
amount  of  research  aimed  at  establishing  an  idea’s  scientific  and  commercial
promise. These grants typically range up to $100,000.

• Phase II funds are used to finance more extensive research and development

and the grant awards are usually around $750,000–$1 million.

• Phase  III  is  the  commercialization  stage  and  companies  are  expected  to  use

non-SBIR funds to get their product into the marketplace.

53

The  Small  Business  Administration  establishes  the  eligibility  criteria  for  partici-
pation  in  the  SBIR  program.  As  such,  only  United  States  small  business  concerns
(SBCs)  are  eligible  for  an  SBIR  award.  The  SBC  must  be  organized  for-profit  with
its place of business in the United States. It must be independently owned and oper-
ated, and it must meet one of two ownership criteria: it must be at least 51 percent
owned  and  controlled  by  one  or  more  individuals  who  are  citizens  of,  or  permanent
resident  aliens  in,  the  United  States,  or,  it  must  be  a  for-profit  business  concern
that is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are
citizens  of,  or  permanent  resident  aliens  in,  the  United  States.  Finally,  the  SBC
must be small in that it must have no more than 500 employees including affiliates.
Synapse’s  involvement  in  the  SBIR  program  has  provided  important  support  for
continued innovation of our technology platform. Our current grants extend the po-
tential  use  and  market  potential  for  our  diaphragm  stimulation  technology  in  com-
pelling  need  orphan  clinical  diseases  of  spinal  cord  injury  and  ALS.  Our  ability  to
participate  in  the  SBIR  program  provides  the  R&D  funds  to  continue  these  efforts.
Without the SBIR funds we could not support the manpower to apply to continuing
the advancement of our platform in these areas.

Synapse is a small business. We have eight full-time employees and one part-time
employee.  We  are  actively  sponsoring/conducting  two  pivotal  device  trials  for  appli-
cation  of  our  DPS  System  in  spinal  cord  injury  and  ALS.  We  have  recently  made
our  first  market  application  to  the  FDA  for  use  of  the  device  in  spinal  cord  injury.
We  have  setup  a  complete  clean-room,  manufacturing  facility,  and  quality  system
with  ISO  13485  certification  and  also  anticipate  submitting  for  European  market
approval  within  approximately  one  month.  To  accomplish  this  we  run  a  very  lean
and efficient shop. We have spent $2.5MM since the inception of Synapse to achieve
these  accomplishments  with  a  very  dedicated  and  motivated  staff.  Our  vision  is  to
build a profitable company based on the sound science of our initial clinical applica-
tions.  To  continue  these  accomplishments  and  establish  a  sound  foundation  for  the
company  to  further  build  upon,  we  anticipate  spending  another  $4MM.  To  be  able
to  fund  these  activities  and  most  importantly  be  able  to  commit  the  resources  nec-
essary for a 100 patient pivotal trial in ALS to the patients and clinical community,
we have had to raise significant venture investments. As indicated in my disclosure
statement,  we  have  currently  exchanged  49  percent  of  the  company  equity  to  ven-
ture  and  other  institutional  investors  to  raise  this  money.  We  have  retained  just
over  51  percent  of  the  ownership  with  the  company  founders  and  initial  individual
angel investors.

Since  our  device  has  a  Category  B1  designation  by  the  FDA  and  CMS  we  have
been able to charge for the device during clinical trials and have therefore been able
to  realize  total  income  since  our  inception  of  almost  $1MM.  This  includes  awards
(for our business plan), SBIR grants, contract manufacturing efforts and reimburse-
ment for clinical study devices. The SBIR program grant funds that we have drawn
down to date have been approximately 14 percent of this total. We additionally have
another $200K in current SBIR grants funds available and pending award.

The  Committee  has  asked  me  to  address  ways  in  which  the  SBIR  program  could
be improved. As I noted before, under the 2003 rule change, Synapse is on the cusp
of no longer being eligible to apply for the SBIR grant due to the fact that additional
institutional  investments  would  put  us  below  the  51  percent  owned  by  individuals’
qualification.  Our  situation  is  one  that  is  also  faced  by  a  majority  of  companies  in
the  medical  device  industry  as  evidenced  in  part  by  the  decline  in  applications  for
SBIR  grants  since  the  2003  rule  change.  Based  on  the  awards  statistics  located  on
the  National  Institutes  of  Health’s  (NIH)  website,  there  has  been  a  significant  de-
cline  in  applications  for  SBIR  grants.  In  the  first  year  (2004–2005),  post  the  rule
change,  there  was  a  12  percent  decrease  in  applications  followed  by  an  almost  15
percent decrease this past year (2005–2006). This after double digit increases in the
two years leading up to 2003.

Some suggestions that I believe would make the program more effective in achiev-

ing its goals and therefore improved include:

1992;

• Increasing  the  dollar  amount  of  the  awards  as  they  have  not  changed  since
• Providing NIH with more flexibility in administering the SBIR program; and
• Returning to the previous policy before the 2003 rule change so that all com-
panies can have an equal chance in participating in the federal grant process.
This  would  mean  allowing  companies  that  are  majority  venture  backed  to
participate  in  the  program.  This  would  mean  allowing  some  companies  that
are  majority  owned—in  the  aggregate—by  multiple  VCs  to  participate  in  the
program.

To  elaborate  on  my  recommendations,  I  believe  that  it  would  benefit  the  small
businesses  that  apply  for  the  grants  if  the  Phase  I  award  could  be  increased  to
$150,000  and  the  Phase  II  award  increased  to  $1.25  million.  This  could  potentially
encourage  companies  that  are  currently  not  applying  for  the  grants  because  they
think  the  awards  are  too  low  and  therefore  not  worth  the  time  and  effort  required
to submit a successful SBIR application.

I  also  believe  there  are  opportunities  to  improve  the  SBIR  program  by  providing
NIH  with  more  administration  flexibility.  Specifically,  I  think  it  would  be  helpful
to  the  NIH  if  the  costs  of  administering  the  program  (three  percent)  could  be  paid
out  of  the  SBIR  funds.  MDMA  and  those  of  us  in  the  industry  agree  that  it  would
be  appropriate  to  allow  three  percent  of  the  SBIR  funds  to  pay  for  administrative
costs.  These  resources  will  help  to  administer  the  SBIR  program  without  diverting
funds  from  other  areas  within  NIH.  Second,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  remove  the
requirement that a company must have applied for a Phase I grant in order to apply
for a Phase II grant. Under the current rules, only companies that have applied and
received a Phase I SBIR grant are eligible to apply for a Phase II grant. If this rule
were  changed,  I  believe  many  more  small  businesses  would  submit  applications  for
SBIR grants.

Finally,  my  greatest  concern  pertaining  to  the  viability  of  the  SBIR  program  is
the  need  to  increase  participation  of  all  innovative  small  businesses  in  federal  re-
search and development including those with venture backing. A key purpose of the
SBIR  program,  a  public-private  partnership,  is  to  help  entrepreneurs  overcome
many  of  the  obstacles  they  face  in  developing  new  technologies.  The  SBIR  program
as  originally  designed  does  this,  but  its  effectiveness  is  being  hampered  by  the  fact
that  many  small  businesses  are  deemed  ineligible  to  participate  in  the  SBIR  pro-
gram  based  on  their  financing  structure.  Further,  the  program  is  not  meeting  its
entire  goal  to  stimulate  and  sustain  technological  innovation.  The  stimulation  and
sustaining  of  technological  innovation  will  only  be  met  if  all  companies  regardless
of how they are financed are able to apply for SBIR grants; if NIH has the flexibility
it  needs  to  administer  the  awards  and  the  dollar  amount  of  the  individual  awards
are increased.

Again, thank you for providing me with the opportunity to testify today before the

Subcommittee.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ANTHONY R. IGNAGNI

As  co-founder,  President  and  CEO  of  Synapse  Biomedical,  Inc.,  Mr.  Ignagni
(‘‘Tony’’)  is  responsible  for  the  strategic  planning  for  the  company.  Tony  has  devel-
oped  and  commercialized  medical  devices  for  over  20  years.  He  received  his  under-
graduate  and  graduate  degrees  from  Case  Western  Reserve  University  in  the  area
of Biomedical Engineering specializing in applied neural control. As a research engi-
neer, at the Cleveland FES Center, he has designed neurostimulation software and
instrumentation  and  applied  these  efforts  clinically.  As  part  of  the  efforts  that  led
to  the  formation  of  NeuroControl  Corporation,  Tony  has  had  direct  experience  in
transferring this technology from the university environment to commercially viable
products. As an original member and Vice President of NeuroControl he established
many  of  the  base  systems  required  for  operations  within  the  scope  of  the  regulated
medical  device  industry  and  led  the  product  development  efforts  that  brought
neurostimulation devices to the U.S. and European markets.
About Synapse

Synapse  Biomedical  Inc.  (SBI)  is  established  with  the  mission  to  develop,  manu-
facture,  market  and  support  life  changing  minimally  invasive  neurostimulation  de-
vices used in the diagnosis and treatment of persons with neurological impairment.
Founded  in  September  2002,  to  support  the  ongoing  clinical  study  of  the  DPS  Sys-
tem for Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency at University Hospitals of Cleveland, SBI
has  licensed  the  core  patents  from  Case  Western  Reserve  University  and  is  com-
prised  of  investigators  from  University  Hospitals  (Cleveland,  OH),  MetroHealth
Medical Center (Cleveland, OH) and Case Western Reserve University. The current
percutaneous technology has been successful in spinal cord patients for over fifty cu-
mulative  patient  years  and  demonstrated  clinical  promise  in  the  pilot  series  of
Amyotrophic  Lateral  Sclerosis  (ALS,  commonly  known  as  Lou  Gehrig’s  disease)  pa-
tients.  The  longest  implanted  patient  has  used  the  device  for  full-time  respiratory
support for over six years.

SBI’s  product  portfolio  is  focused  on  neurostimulation  devices  for  minimally
invasive  surgical  interventions  and  respiratory  assist.  These  two  areas  of  medical
specialization have come together in our first product, the NeuRX DPS System. The
founders  of  the  Company  have  pioneered  the  innovative  use  of  standard  minimally

invasive  laparoscopic  techniques  to  provide  ventilation  in  persons  with  respiratory
muscle  paralysis.  This  technological  advance  provides  a  device  that  is  a  low-risk,
low-cost alternative to a very invasive procedure that has been performed for thirty-
five  years.  The  media  awareness  that  has  come,  as  a  result  of  Christopher  Reeve,
our  third  implanted  patient,  has  reached  over  13  million  households  through  print
circulation  and  many  more  through  his  appearances  on  national  and  international
television  broadcasts.  As  a  result  of  this,  we  have  been  able  to  reach  a  large  popu-
lation of patients, with over 50 patient implants.

The NeuRΧ Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System is currently being stud-
ied  in  two  human  clinical  trials.  The  first  trial  of  chronic  diaphragm  pacing  has
demonstrated  clinical  efficacy  as  a  ventilator  replacement  in  chronic  respiratory  in-
sufficiency with a 97 percent success rate in providing ventilatory support. The sec-
ond  ongoing  clinical  trial  is  for  diaphragm  conditioning  stimulation  to  improve  the
survival  time  in  ALS,  which  has  shown  a  preliminary  20  month  survival  benefit  in
the pilot series. Additional feasibility studies have begun to demonstrate the thera-
peutic  implementation  of  diaphragm  stimulation  in  an  acute  ventilatory  assist  trial
intended  to  demonstrate  reduction  in  ventilator  associated  risks,  improvements  in
cardiovascular function, and maintenance of diaphragm contractile properties in in-
tensive  care  units.  SBI  is  at  the  forefront  of  the  pioneering  use  of  Natural  Orifice
Translumenal  Endoscopic  Surgery  (NOTES)  for  the  clinically  recognized  efforts  as
the  seminal  application  for  acute  ventilatory  assist.  Additional  trials  are  planned,
beyond  the  diaphragm,  to  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  the  technology  platform  in
two  active  research  areas  of  SBI’s  founders:  chronic  abdominal  pain  and
gastroesophageal reflux disease.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Ignagni.  And  now  we
move onto the question phase of our hearing, and The Chair recog-
nizes himself for five minutes.

Dr.  McGarrity,  you  characterized  both  in  your  written  and  your
oral  testimony  that  SBA  has  stated  the  ownership  rule  is  a  proxy
for  determining  that  a  company  is  domestic,  and  Mr.  Schmidt  has
stated that what is at issue is size. And I wanted to give both you,
Dr. McGarrity, an opportunity to comment on that and Mr. Ignagni
and Mr. Schmidt to reply to that discussion about whether looking
at  the  capital  structure,  that  is,  whether  venture  capital  is  owned
50 percent plus one share of an enterprise is an appropriate divid-
ing line for SBIR or not.

Dr. MCGARRITY. No, I don’t think there is at all. The regulations
say that a company, a small company, should be less than 500 em-
ployees.  So  if  you  use  that  as  the  guideline,  technically  my  com-
pany,  Intronn  at  the  time  had  20  employees,  no  revenue  stream,
and  we  were  declared  ineligible.  In  other  words,  we  were  not  an
appropriate  small  business.  On  the  other  hand,  you  could  have  a
company with 450 employees and making revenues of $20, $30 mil-
lion a year and they qualify. So I think the rule change was based
on  the  fact  that,  as  you  said,  you  wanted  greater  than  50  percent
ownership  to  be  domestic  ownership,  and  I  think  they  use  that  as
a  means  of  saying  that  50  percent  or  50-plus  percent  should  be
owned  by  individuals;  and  for  this  particular  application,  the  indi-
viduals  or  a  venture  firm  was  not  defined  as  an  individual.  And  I
think that was the basis of the whole change in policy.

Chairman WU. Mr. Ignagni.
Mr. IGNAGNI. I certainly agree that I think the 51 percent owner-
ship  issue  is  really  irrelevant  from  my  perspective  from  what  we
are trying to do. We have to raise enough money to be able to com-
mit  to  clinical  trials,  and  to  do  that  we  have  to  find  funding  from
available  sources;  and  if  that  means  going  to  a  venture  company

of support.

to  find  that  funding,  that  is  what  we  had  to  do.  And  it  is—you
know,  we  are  not  bringing  in  revenue.  We  have  made  $1  million
since  our  inception,  so  it  is  not  supporting  us  as  a  company  but  it
is  allowing  us  to  continue  in  ways—in  increased  our  technology
platform  in  ways  that  a  venture  company  is  not  going  to  support.
So  we  can  go  after  larger  markets,  but  continuing  to  help  people
with  spinal  cord  injury,  people  with  ALS,  those  are  orphan  mar-
kets,  those  are  niche  markets,  and  those  aren’t  things  that  are
going to be supported by the venture community.

So  we  would  have  to  let  go  of  those  if  we  didn’t  have  this  kind

Chairman WU. Mr. Schmidt, your response to——
Mr. SCHMIDT. Yes, thank you.
Chairman WU.—those statements.
Mr. SCHMIDT. I am extremely troubled by Dr. McGarrity’s domes-
ticity  issue.  I’m  not  quite  sure  whether  he’s  suggesting  the  United
States taxpayer support incorporations. I am just not—I don’t know
where  that  is  going.  On  the  size  issue,  what  I  am  most  concerned
about  is  having  large  company  and  large  VC  control  over  these
small companies.

Chairman  WU.  Would  you  have  an  objection—let  us  say  it  were
a  20-employee  biotech  but  it  had  51  percent  VC  ownership.  Would
you object under those circumstances?

Mr. SCHMIDT. Well, when you have got Intel forming VCs and all
of  a  sudden  they  go  out  and  buy,  you  know,  ABC  Company  with
20 employees, they are not a 20-person employee anymore—20-per-
son company anymore. They are, you know, a billion-dollar corpora-
tion. And the Milliken Institute which——

Chairman  WU.  With  all  due  respect,  Mr.  Schmidt,  when  I  have
spoken with Intel VCs, they have no—they rarely have any interest
in  a  strategic  ownership  of  the  underlying  entity.  It  is  purely  a  fi-
nancial  relationship  for  the  most  part,  trying  to  grow  out  the  eco-
system where they are going to take down Intel chips that has be-
come a future ecosystem for consuming Intel chips, their core busi-
ness.

Mr. SCHMIDT. I think it always becomes a strategic interest from
a  large  corporation,  but  on  the  fact  of  the  VCs,  the  Headtron  type
of  VC,  you  have  still  got  this  very  large  group  of  investors  and  we
have  no—so  you  understand  our  position—we  have  no  objection  to
small  VCs  owning  a  majority  of  the  company  which  happens  now
and  is  allowable  under  the  rules.  And  under  Dr.  Zerhouni’s  letter,
which Dr. McGarrity was referring to—in fact, later on in the letter
Dr.  Zerhouni  goes  on  to  say  the  affiliation  rules  should  not  be
changed.

So  in  the  Milliken  Report  they  go  on  and  say  that  there  are  six
ways that they suggest which I would like to include in the record
that  we  can  fund  large  drug  companies  or  tiny  drug  companies  to
become manufacturers of large drugs, and none of them involve the
SBIR  Program.  And  when  we  have  an  $800  million  to  $1.2  billion
investment  in  a  drug,  that  means  the  entire  NIH  SBIR  budget
can’t produce one drug.

Chairman WU. My time has expired. We will return to this topic.
But let me ask folks’ indulgence just for a moment to ask Mr. Held

if this ownership issue is of concern in the DOD SBIR realm as op-
posed to those programs in other departments.

Mr.  HELD.  It  is  not  an  issue  that  we  looked  at  in  our  research,

so I really couldn’t give you a good answer on that.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Held.  And  I  would  like  to  recog-

nize Dr. Gingrey for five minutes.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  This  is  it  seems  to  me
a very crucial question as we develop, go forward with reauthoriza-
tion  and  the  markup  that  will  be  done  later  on  in  the  year.  That
is the reason we have these hearings, of course, is to try to improve
to  go  forward  with  what  is  good,  to  eliminate  what  is  bad,  and  to
make  changes  based  on  expert  testimony.  And  so  that  is  why  it  is
so important that we are doing this here today.

And  it  seems  that  this  question,  this  51  percent  rule  provision,
is  very  critical;  and  I  am  not  sure  I  completely  understand  it.  I
think I understand the basics of it, but I thought maybe Mr. Baron,
if  I  would  address  my  question  to  you  because  you  have  a  fairly
long  history  as  you  explained  in  your—both  your  statements  and
your written bio going back to the time that you were on the Small
Business Committee, just give us a glimpse into the legislative his-
tory  of  this,  this  51  percent  rule—I  guess  it  is—and  was  it  origi-
nally  to  encourage  domestic  innovation?  What  was  really  the  rea-
son  why  the  SBA  made  these  new  interpretations?  Just  kind  of
take us back and walk through the history of it.

Mr.  BARON.  Okay.  I  would  be  happy  to.  The  legislation  basically
defined  small  companies  as  having  500  or  fewer  employees  for  the
purpose  of  this  program  and  left  it  up  to  the  great  discretion—or
left  great  discretion  to  the  SBA  to  apply  that  and  develop  regula-
tions  and  so  on  and  to  use  its  normal  rules  as  to  what  constitutes
a  small  company  with  500  employees,  if  it  is  owned  by  a  larger
company or affiliated with a larger company.

So  basically,  the  statute  itself  gives  SBA  a  lot  of  discretion  and
for  most  of  the  history  of  the  program,  SBA  allowed  in—did  not
have  this  ownership,  this  particular  ownership  rule.  So  this  was  a
change  in  the  way  that  they—SBA  interpreted  what  constitutes  a
small business. That wasn’t based directly in the legislation.

Mr.  GINGREY.  My  understanding  is  that  in  2003  is  when  they
made this most recent interpretation, this change if you will. Were
there  certain  other  times  in  the  25-year  history  of  the  program
where  they  made  other  step-wise  changes  other  than  the  500-em-
ployee rule?

Mr.  BARON.  They  have  made  other  changes,  none  I  think  quite
as  had  as  much  affect  on  the  program  as  that  one.  They  do  make
changes over time in things like how strictly they interpret the size
of SBIR awards that an agency can grant, things like that, whether
they  allow  flexibility  to  go  over  the  $100,000,  $750,000  mark,
things  like  that;  but  they  tend  to  be  more  modest  changes.  This
was a larger one.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Well,  you  haven’t  quite  completely  answered  my

question. What do you in your opinion—are you an attorney?

Mr. BARON. I am.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Good.  Doctors  don’t  hate  all  attorneys.  Explain  to
us what you think their reasoning was behind this reinterpretation
of this change in 2003.

58

Mr.  BARON.  I  am  not  intimately  familiar  with  their  reasoning,
but  I  think  the  general  idea  was  that  it  didn’t  really  qualify  as  a
small  business  for  the  purposes  of  what  Congress  has  intended  if
it is owned by a venture capital firm if that is the majority entity.
Let me mention one other thing if I could. As I mentioned in my
testimony, I think a big challenge in the SBIR Program is focusing
SBIR funds on companies that are serious about commercialization,
not  just  doing  research  but  taking  that  research  and  converting  it
into a product. A company that has obtained some venture funding
has—I  would  think  is  the  kind  of  company  that  is  more  likely  to
be  able  to  convert  their  research.  They  are  clearly  motivated.  A
venture capital firm would not have contributed money to the com-
pany  if  it  hadn’t  reviewed  the  business  plan  and  seen  that  there
was a market size. So I think my own feeling about the underlying
policy is that it probably inhibits the success of the program in con-
verting research into viable new products.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  see  my  time  has  expired.  I  hope
we  will  have  more  time  to—in  our  second  round  to  come  back  to
this  and  continue  to  pursue  it.  It  may  be  that  some  of  the  other
witnesses want to comment on that as well, and I guess they prob-
ably would.

Chairman  WU.  Dr.  Gingrey,  I  think  that  you  and  I  will  have
multiple  rounds.  Now  that  I  know  that  you  are  an  attorney,  Mr.
Baron, is there a statutory basis for the ALJ’s Decision about ven-
ture  capital  ownership  or  is  this  shall  we  say  a  broad  interpreta-
tion of the SBA’s authority?

Mr.  BARON.  There  was  not  an  underlying  statutory  change  that
caused  the  SBA  to  change  its  interpretation.  This  was  just  a  deci-
sion  that  was  initiated  by  the  SBA  with  the  idea  that  they  were
interpreting what Congress wanted in saying funds under this pro-
gram should go toward small businesses.

Chairman  WU.  Mr.  Baron  and  Mr.  Schmidt,  I  think  that  there
was  some  expressed  concern  about  skewing,  whether  it  is  towards
size, domesticity, or any other factor. Since this decision was hand-
ed  down  in  the  relatively  recent  past,  has  there  been  a  change  in
pattern? Was there skewing before that has been addressed by this
decision?

Mr.  BARON.  I  am  probably  not  in  as  good  a  position  to  comment
on  that.  The  other  witnesses  I  thought  were  fairly  compelling  in
evidence  from  NIH  that  the—it  has  excluded  some  companies  that
otherwise would have participated.

Mr. SCHMIDT. Just as a moment of history, the way I understand
this,  and  we  will  get  you  more  information  and  provide  that  over
the  next  week  or  so,  but  it  is  my  understanding  that  a  1952  stat-
ute—so  we  have  had  55  years  of  legislative  history  on  independ-
ently  owned  and  operated—so  we  go  back  to  Eisenhower,  you
know, in those years to talk about—actually, this would have been
Truman—to  be  able  to  say  this  is  what  the  small  business  is  all
about  from  1952.  And  that  has  not  been  changed  since  1952,  this
independently owned and operated and 500 employees.

Chairman WU. That is with respect to SBA statutes——
Mr. SCHMIDT. Well, SBA——
Chairman WU.—and not SBIR.

Mr.  SCHMIDT.  It  incorporated  in  the  1982  statute,  and  none  of
that ever changed. The only thing that happened in 2003 was they
finally decided to enforce it. So by going back and changing it now,
we are overturning the last 55 years of history in this area.

Chairman WU. Well, with the 2003 change——
Mr. SCHMIDT. It wasn’t a change, it was an enforcement.
Chairman  WU.  Well,  there  was  certainly  a  change  in  2003,
whether  it  was  a  change  in  interpretation  or  a  change  in  enforce-
ment,  was  there  a  skewing  problem  that  was  addressed  by  that?
Mr.  SCHMIDT.  I  can’t  answer  that  question  of  what  this  was.
What we had was corporations that were violating the rule that fi-
nally were enforced against.

Chairman WU. Dr. McGarrity and Mr. Ignagni.
Dr.  MCGARRITY.  Well,  I  would  say  we  looked  at  the  interpreta-
tion, and we applied like everyone else. So I can’t say we were vio-
lating  the  rules.  That  was  what  the  SBA  was  enforcing  from  the
beginning.  As  far  as  experiences,  I  will  go  back  to  the  NIH  saying
that, one, the number of grant applications of SBIR has gone down,
and number two, the quality of SBIR grants has gone down. If you
look  at  the  success  stories  that  I  said,  there  are  companies  like
Amgen  and  Genintech  and  Genzyme  that  are  wonderful  success
stories  in  our  industry.  They  got  SBIR  grants  in  the  early  stages,
and one would hate to think what might have happened if that rule
were applied to them. In our own particular case, as I said, I think
the  emphasis  has  to  be  on  the  innovation  and  what  the  Congress
needs and what the Nation needs as far as R&D. The first applica-
tion  that  we  made  to  the  NIH,  the  review  committee,  18  to  20  ex-
perts  in  the  field  said  they  wanted  to  double  our  budget.  Now,
when was the last time you heard a government agency saying we
want  to  double  your  budget?  The  next  grant  that  we  put  in,  a  dif-
ferent  review  committee  said  this  was  one  of  the  most  innovative,
thoughtful, and exciting application they ever read.

So  the  NIH  and  my  company,  Intronn,  invested  several  million
dollars that had great promise in cystic fibrosis, and it was just cut
short. So I would say, you know, the objective here should be what
is  best  for  the  Nation’s  need  and  the  Nation’s  research.  Mr.
Schmidt  said  it  takes  $800  million.  We  can’t  do  that  from  NIH’s
budget.  That  is  not  even  relevant  to  the  point.  What  you  need  is
what  you  said  in  the  beginning,  Chairman.  The  crying  need  for
biotech  companies  is  in  the  early  stages.  If  you  can  get  that  fi-
nanced to a point where you are in clinical trials or you have proof
of  concept,  then  you  can  get  equity  investment  and  then  you  can
get  larger  companies  partnering  in.  So  we  need  the  help  in  the
early  stages  of  development  where  conventional  financing  in  this
field simply is not available.

Chairman WU. Thank you very much, Dr. McGarrity. And before
I  turn  to  Dr.  Gingrey,  Mr.  Ignagni,  you  were  eager  to  have  some
input on this particular discussion.

Mr.  IGNAGNI.  I  think  Dr.  McGarrity  did  mention  what  I  was
going  to  mention  also  that  according  to  the  NIH’s  website,  there
has been a significant reduction in the number of qualified applica-
tions  in  the  years  since  the  2003  rule  change.  And  certainly  from
my  own  perspective,  I  did  not—there  have  been  certain  times  in
the development of Synapse that we had to make a decision. Do we

want  to  go  after  more  grants  and  try  to  keep  more  ownership  or
do we really want to step foreword and go forward with helping pa-
tients  and  go  after  an  ALS  trial,  to  commit  to  an  ALS  trial  of  the
magnitude  that  we  have.  We  needed  significant  funds,  and  those
funds  aren’t  available  in  the  grant  world  for  us.  So  we  had  to  go
after  VC  funding.  And  so  just  the  nature  of  the  type  of  company
we  are  running  clinical  trials,  two  pivotal  studies,  we  had  to  go
after  VC  funding;  and  there  are  decisions  that  have  to  be  made  at
this point, whether or not we go after more VC funding or whether
we  try  to  hold  back  and  not  help  as  many  patients  and  grow  as
fast.

Chairman WU. Thank you. Dr. Gingrey.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Ignagni,  you  mentioned  I  think  in  your  testi-
mony  that  you  used  the  term  angel  investor.  I  do  now  know  what
that  is,  but  it  was  only  recently  that  I  realized  what  an  angel  in-
vestor  was;  and  you  might—maybe  nobody  in  this  room  or  every-
body  in  this  room  knows  exactly  what  you  are  talking  about,  but
you  might  define  that  for  us,  and  I  am  curious  to  know  whether
angel  investors  in  a  small  start-up  technology  type  company,  bio-
medical company that both you and Dr. McGarrity are involved in,
do  those  count  against  you  in  regard  to  the  percentage  rule  that
the Small Business Administration has handed down back in 2003?
Mr.  IGNAGNI.  Since  the  angel  investors  and  angel  investors  are
individuals,  friends  and  family,  high  net  worth  individuals  in  the
community,  they  are  individual  people  identified  as  such,  so  that
they  would  not  count  against  that  51  percent  rule.  Groups  like
Jump  Start,  which  is  an  entrepreneurial  assistance  program  in
Cleveland  but  is  made  up  of  a  large  consortium  of  people,  specifi-
cally to help companies such as Synapse get off the ground and get
started. They would be, you know, in my calculation, my way of in-
terpreting  the  rule,  they  are  counted  against  us  because  they  are
a consortium of a number of unnamed individuals.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Well,  do  you  count  them—it  is  not  actually—you
are  not  counting  individuals,  you  are  counting  the  percentage  of
the worth of a company, the equity in the company? So if the com-
pany  is  worth  $6  million  as  an  example  on  the  books  and  then
$3,000,001 of that has been sold essentially to a venture capitalist,
whether  it  is  one  venture  capitalist  who  just  has  a  lot  of  money,
you  wouldn’t  consider  that  person  an  angel  investor,  because  they
are  in  the  business  of  lending  money.  It  could  be  one  or  it  could
be a consortium. But the 51 percent or 50 as the Chairman pointed
out, 50 percent plus one is based on the total dollar amount, right?

Mr. IGNAGNI. Correct.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  yield  back  at  this  point,  and

I look forward to the next round.

Chairman  WU.  Terrific.  Let  us  return  perhaps  a  little  bit  later
to  this  issue  of  size  versus  capital  structure  and  whether  capital
structure ought to be used as a proxy for size, domesticity, or any-
thing else.

There was discussion earlier about using the track record of com-
mercialization as a factor in granting future SBIR grants, and Mr.
Baron, can you describe for us first of all how you think this would
work and secondly, what the impact would be on commercialization

rates. And perhaps Mr. Held, Mr. Schmidt, you would care to com-
ment on that also.

Mr.  BARON.  Yes,  at  the  Department  of  Defense,  which  is  the
agency  I  am  most  familiar  with,  its  SBIR  program,  one  of  the
things that they do is ask each company in submitting an SBIR ap-
plication to provide just basic information on previous SBIR awards
that were won and commercial sales that resulted from that, either
to  the  government  or  to  the  private  sector,  as  well  as  any  addi-
tional  investment  they  raised,  which  are  two  good  proxies  for
whether  the  thing  actually  got  commercialized,  assuming  enough
time has passed. And so there is very good information for each ap-
plicant  which  is  hard  to  gain  on  whether  they  have  actually  done
anything  with  the  prior  SBIR  awards.  And  it  shows,  you  know,  in
general  that  there  are  some  companies  that  are  excellent
commercializers, including some multiple award winners are excel-
lent  commercializers.  And  then  there  are  some  companies  like
those  I  have  described  which  have  very  strong  research  capabili-
ties,  win  SBIR  awards,  but  consistently  do  not  convert  them  into
products  that  succeed  in  either  government  or  private-sector  mar-
kets.

So  one  thing  that  could  be  done,  that  information  is  not  used  in
a  sizeable  way  in  the  proposal  evaluation  process  but  it  could  be.
In  order  to  focus  funds,  it  would  be  possible  for  agencies  to  revise
their  proposal  evaluation  criteria  to  focus  SBIR  awards  on  either
companies that are new to the SBIR Program or to companies that
have  a  strong  commercialization  track  record  and  to  focus  funds
away  from  companies  that  have  repeatedly  won  and  have  not
turned  the  grants  into  research  into  viable  products.  That  is  one
simple  way,  I  think  a  fairly  straightforward  way  it  could  be  done.
Chairman  WU.  Would  that  straightforward  method  be  more  ap-

plicable to SBIR programs at some agencies rather than others?

Mr.  BARON.  It  is  a  very  good  question  because  at  some  agencies
in different fields, it takes longer to commercialize, like in the bio-
medical field to go through a commercial trial and all of that, than
it  would  at  an  agency  like  the  Department  of  Defense.  You  might
have slightly different rates, time periods you would look at for the
commercialization  track  record.  However,  if  an  SBIR  project  has
gone  through—they  went  Phase  I,  Phase  II,  and  then  a  couple  of
years  have  elapsed  and  nothing  has  happened,  no  additional
money,  even  in  the  biomedical  field,  no  additional  money,  no  addi-
tional  investment,  no  sales,  no  nothing,  you  can  be  pretty  well
sure—there  is  good  evidence  to  suggest  from  the  DOD  data  that
that project is never going to be turned into a commercial product.
Very unlikely, too.

So I think the time period may differ by agency and by field, but
in  general  that  kind  of  additional  money  and  track  record  is  prob-
ably  a  very  good  indication  of  whether  the  company  is  a  good
commercializer.

Chairman WU. Mr. Held, according to your data at DOD, how ap-
plicable is this commercialization rate? Are there other proxies that
would be applicable to the DOD situation?

Mr.  HELD.  Yeah,  the  DOD  does  have  a  pretty  good  metric  for
looking  at  commercialization.  It  is  called  the  Commercialization
Achievement  Index.  The  biggest  issue  with  it  right  now  is  using

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

62

that metric as a criteria when they are judging proposals and mak-
ing  it  a  more  important  criteria,  particularly  for  companies  that
have won multiple SBIR awards. So you might think about making
this  something  that  the—as  they  have  won  five,  ten,  or  more
awards  over  a  certain  number  of  years,  the  commercialization
index becomes more important in terms of how you judge that par-
ticular award.

Chairman WU. Thank you. Dr. Gingery.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  that  is  a  great  question  that  you
asked, and I want to continue with it because my thinking is that,
as  Mr.  Baron  and  Mr.  Held  both  have  described,  it  does  make
sense  that  you  want  to,  unlike  Willy  Sutton,  you  want  in  this  in-
stance  not  go  to  where  the  money  is  to  take  it  out  but  you  want
to  go  to  where  the  success  it  to  put  it  in.  And  I  understand  that.
You want to make a good investment of the taxpayers’ dollars and
you  want  to  make  sure  that  that  metric  of  commercialization  and
track  record  I  guess  is  the  way  you  were  putting  it,  but  it  would
seem  to  me  that  that  might  adversely  discriminate  against  the  lit-
tle start-up.

I  will  give  you  an  example.  I  have  a—and  by  the  way,  to  recuse
myself,  to  my  knowledge  he  has  not  applied  for  any  kind  of  small
business  innovative  research  grant—but  spent  many  years  as  a
stockbroker  for  one  of  the  large  firms  and  then  retired  or  was  re-
tired  maybe  a  little  earlier  than  he  wanted  to  be  but  got  involved
with a Russian scientist, and this is sort of getting into the medical
field,  too.  This  probably  would  be—if  he  were  so  interested  an  ap-
plication through NIH—but what they were trying to do is develop
a  marker,  a  blood  marker,  a  blood  test  to  determine  who  might
truly be suffering from a traumatic brain injury who has sustained
a  bump  on  the  head,  or  maybe  even  much  worse  than  that.  Or  in
Iraq, been inside a Humvee when it went over an improvised explo-
sive  device  but  thank  God  didn’t  lose  a  limb  or  had  no  visible  in-
jury except shock. They also felt that they have the ability to, with
a  blood  test,  to  determine  who  is  likely—any  of  us  in  this  room—
to have a stroke at some point in the future. And so that is pretty
much  what  they  are  involved  in.  Well,  he  has  no  track  record  of
innovation  or  success  or  commercialization.  And  I  know  in  fact
that—that  is  when  I  first  understood  what  an  angel  investor  was.
You  see,  I  am  a  doctor  and  of  course  we  don’t  know  much  about
business.  We  are  very  poor  businessmen  and  women.  But  he  was
telling  me  about  it.  I  asked,  I  said,  Bob,  how  have  you  kept  going
these  three  or  four  years,  five  years  now  that  you  have  had  no  in-
come.  You  are  the  president  of  the  company  but,  you  know,  how
have you sustained yourself and how do you keep it going? He told
me  about  angel  investors  and  of  course,  at  that  point  I  wasn’t—I
didn’t have the privilege of serving with Chairman Wu on this sub-
committee  and  understanding  all  these  programs  that  were  avail-
able, otherwise I would have told him about it.

But  somebody  like  that,  Mr.  Baron,  Mr.  Held,  may  be  at  a  little
bit  of  a  disadvantage,  particularly  in  maybe  one  of  the  agencies  or
departments  that  participate  in  this  program.  It  would  be  kind  of
easy to just say, well, let us just make these grants to the ones that
have good track records, and we don’t have to worry about the due
diligence.  You  know,  if  somebody  is  a  little  bit  on  the  lazy  side,  it

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

may  be  that  it  would  discriminate  against  folks  like  this  little
start-up company that I am talking about back in Atlanta, Georgia.
Dr. McGarrity?

Dr.  MCGARRITY.  Yes,  I  would  just  like  to  extend  that  thought  a
little bit, Congressman, because if you look at the rules and the in-
terpretations presently, if you look at angel investors, if I am John
Smith  and  I  want  to  put  $100,000  into  your  friend’s  company,  if  I
do it as John Smith, it is fine as far as SBIR is concerned. If I put
it  in  as  John  Smith  Trust,  that  is  a  separate  legal  entity;  and  if
I do it as the Smith Family Foundation or Smith and Friends, that
is  a  distinct  legal  entity,  and  they  are  not  counted  as  individuals
according to the current guidelines. So even that kind of murkiness
exists  whether  it  is  an  angel  investor  as  an  individual  or  doing  it
as a trust or a family LLC if you will.

Mr.  GINGREY.  And  I  want  to—Mr.  Schmidt,  you  can  respond  to
this if you like, and I am sure we will get back to you on the next
round, but the idea of maybe having a set-aside for new companies.
Mr.  BARON.  I  think  the  issue  you  raise  is  extremely  important.
I think it could be actually addressed in a way that would provide
more money for new companies in the following way. The proposal
evaluation  process  and  criteria  could  be  set  up  to  give  priority  or
advantage to companies that are either new to the SBIR Program,
like  the  situation  you  just  mentioned,  or  that  are  strong—have  a
strong  commercialization  track  record,  and  focus  funds  away  from
the  companies  that  have  a  weak—that  have  consistently  not  com-
mercialized,  thereby  conceivably,  and  I  think  plausibly,  increasing
the  amount  of  money  that  would  be  available  for  new  companies
and  the  good  commercializers.  I  think  that  would  be  one  way  to
handle it.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  see  my  time  is  up,  but  I  yield

back to you and look forward to you yielding back to me.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  Several  of  the  witnesses
refer  to  providing  for  a  relatively  small  percentage,  perhaps  as
small as one percent, administrative fee for the agencies to admin-
ister  SBIR.  What  kinds  of  improvements  can  we  hope  to  see  from
SBIR  by  providing  for  these  administrative  costs,  and  secondly,
what kinds of costs would you include in this set-aside for adminis-
trative  costs,  and  what  kind  of  costs  would  you  exclude  from  that?
Mr.  BARON.  My  suggestion  on  this,  having  been  the  program
manager for the Department of Defense, I think it is very easy to—
there  were  some  things  that  we  did  like  establishing  the  commer-
cialization  achievement  index,  tracking  commercialization  out-
comes,  etc.,  that  I  think  were  very  useful  and  valuable  to  the  pro-
gram.  There  were  other  things  that  have  been  done  with  adminis-
trative—currently  with  administrative  money,  like  holding  con-
ferences  and  commercialization  training  and  all  that.  And  you
know,  as  the  manager  of  the  program,  I  always  wondered,  is  this
just  a  lot  of  activity  or  are  we  really  doing  any  good  here?  I  think
my  short  answer  is  it  is  very  easy  to  spend—everyone  is  always
asking for more administrative money, and it is easy to spend that
on things that may not be that valuable. And so I sympathize with
a  lot  of  what  Mr.  Schmidt  said  about  not  taking  too  much  off  the
SBIR Program.

That  being  said,  I  would  suggest  a  small—one  thing  which  is
desperately  I  think—desperate  is  too  strong—a  critical  missing
piece  needed  to  improve  the  SBIR  program  and  more  of  those
breakthroughs  is  knowledge  about  different  rules  like  you  have
been  talking  about,  what  sort  of  selection  criteria,  what  sort  of
training, how do you set up the program so as to get the right kind
of  companies  in  there  and  produce  more  of  these  breakthroughs,
these  important  outcomes.  We  don’t  know  how  to  do  that.  We  are
talking  about  all  these  different  rules,  a  little  bit  in  a  vacuum  of
evidence about which ones will work and which ones don’t. I would
suggest  a  small  set-aside  that  is  devoted  specifically  toward  trying
new approaches, trying new approaches to administering the SBIR
program  like  commercialization  track  record  and  evaluation  cri-
teria and then evaluating outcomes in a rigorous evaluation.

So  I  would  suggest  in  the  short-term,  spending  it  on  different
ways of administering the program coupled with a rigorous evalua-
tion, preferably of the type I mentioned before where you might use
random  assignment  to  make  sure  it  produces  scientifically  valid
evidence about what works.

Chairman WU. Mr. Ignagni, you were eager to say something.
Mr. IGNAGNI. Yes, I actually want to answer part of Mr. Baron’s
question as to the value of conferences and the assistance programs
that the agencies run. I have written four SBIR grants myself and
been  fortunate  to  receive  three  awards,  and  I  don’t  think  I  would
have  received  any  of  those  awards  if  I  had  not  attended  some  of
those  conferences.  I  mean,  Dr.  Goodnight  who  I  saw  in  the  back
provides valuable, extremely valuable information, to start-up com-
panies and especially the small companies. Your friend that started
a  company,  if  he  had  attended  one  of  these  conferences,  he  could
have  found  out  about  the  aspects  of  taking  knowledge,  an  idea
through  the  SBIR  Program  and  how  to  commercialize  it.  They  run
seminars  on  providing  that  kind  of  commercialization  assistance,
how to generate the Phase III, if you will. And those are all things
that  I  think  these  kinds  of—that  kind  of  set-aside  should  continue
to support.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Ignagni.  Mr.  Schmidt,  you  were
most  concerned  about  the  effect  of  an  administrative  set-aside  on
the  availably  of  SBIR  funds  to  a  broad  range  of  small  businesses,
for  this  phase  of  my  questions,  I  will  give  you  the  close  on  what
costs should be excluded.

Mr. SCHMIDT. Well, thank you. I am glad Tony acknowledged Dr.
Joanne  Goodnight.  Raise  your  hand,  because  she  is  an  extremely
capable,  valuable  person  in  this  program  at  the  NIH  and  runs  the
program  there.  And  quite  frankly,  you  know,  we  are  not  against
administrative costs. The SBTC’s position is, don’t suck away from
the  program  the  little  bit  that  we  have  now.  I  testified  that  it  had
one-eighth of what it should have, if it was fair. But don’t take that
to  mean  we  believe  that  an  increase  of  one  percent  of  the  new
money  going  beyond  2007  funding  should  be  allowed  for  adminis-
trative expenses.

But  in  general,  you  know,  I  think  they  know  how  to  run  their
program,  and  I  would  give  that  discretion  to  the  individual  agen-
cies.  The  one  thing  that  I  would  suggest,  though,  is  that  anything
above that in administrative expense go toward this commercializa-

tion pilot program type of endeavor which is in the Defense Depart-
ment  to  be  able  to  make  sure  technologies  get  commercialized
through DOD, this Section 252 of last year’s authorization bill and
have  something  like  that  for  NIH  to  get  us  from  technology  readi-
ness  levels  four  or  five  which  is  typically  where  Phase  II  lets  off
to  technology  readiness  level  eight  which  gets  you  further  through
the  development  phase  of  clinical  trials,  in  the  NIH  case  in  flight
tests  or  wind  tunnel  tests  in  DOD’s  case,  things  along  those  lines
where  you  do  more  of  the  development  work  that  is  beyond  the
scope  of  a  traditional  Phase  II.  It  takes  about  $10  million  to  de-
velop a little widget in today’s market places.

So  this  $850,000  of  the  Phase  I,  Phase  II,  you  know,  doesn’t  get

you a tenth of the way there to be able to have a real product.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Schmidt.  And  Mr.  Gingrey,  if  I
may,  I  thought  that  Mr.  Held  wanted  to  make  a  contribution  to
this particular discussion.

Mr.  HELD.  I  do.  I  think  this  is  an  extremely  important  issue  to
discuss. As we looked at how the SBIR Program is managed in the
Department  of  Defense,  one  thing  that  is  clear  is  the  mismanage-
ment  processes  is  a  fairly  complex  one.  It  is  time  consuming,  it
takes  a  lot  of  resources;  and  what  I  am  talking  about  are  things
like  contract  management,  technical  oversight.  You  can  start  to
look  at  some  of  the  integration  issues  with  larger  systems  that
some of these technologies may be going into. So there is a lot that
has  to  go  on  in  terms  of  administering  and  managing  the  resource
that is going on in the SBIR program. And by separating the costs
associated  with  managing  the  program  from  the  projects  them-
selves,  you  create  disincentives  to  want  to  actually  manage  the
projects  in  the  acquisition  programs  out  there.  And  hence  they  get
pushed out of those and the opportunities to commercialize are de-
creased  as  a  result  of  that,  at  least  commercialized  in  the  sense  of
going  into  DOD  systems.  If  a  set-aside—and  I  think  it  is  substan-
tially  larger  than  the  one  percent  that  has  been  discussed  here—
can  be  put  together  and  attached  to  the  projects  and  the  program
itself, you will start to diminish some of those disincentives and ac-
tually  see  an  ability  to  start  to  commercialize  the  technologies
more.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Held.  And  now  I
would  like  to  recognize  Dr.  Ehlers,  the  gentleman  from  Michigan
with  whom  I  have  had  the  privilege  of  working  on  this  sub-
committee as his Ranking Member in the last Congress. Dr. Ehlers.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Actually,  the  last  hear-
ing  we  had  on  this  subject  the  roles  were  reversed.  I  was  sitting
in the chair, and you were not. I actually thought that was a good
arrangement. But if I had to choose someone to take my place, Mr.
Wu,  it  would  have  been  you.  And  I  appreciate  your  leadership  on
this.

Let  me  ask  a  heretical  question  and  that  is,  does  it  make  sense
for  the  administration  of  this  still  to  be  centered  in  the  SBA,  and
I am responding in part to your question, Mr. Held, of management
of  the  program.  In  the  last  hearing  we  had  on  this,  several  Mem-
bers and I came away concerned about whether SBA really has the
expertise,  research  expertise,  that  is  needed  for  the  overall  man-
agement.  Now,  I  know  it  is  a  very  complex  structure  handled  by

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

66

the  different  agencies  and  so  forth.  But  I  came  away  wondering  if
perhaps  an  agency  such  as  NIST  might  be  better,  simply  because
NIST  already  does  a  lot  of  this  through  the  MEP  program,  also
through  what  used  to  be  the  ATP  program  which  is  being  super-
seded,  thanks  to  this  committee.  If  the  Senate  agrees,  we  will  re-
place it with a different program. And again, they have a lot of ex-
perience  in  this  area.  It  may  be  perfectly  well  to  leave  it  where  it
is, but I am just trying to get your opinion. So Mr. Held, you start-
ed the thought process in my mind, so you can start first.

Mr.  HELD.  Well,  it  is  not  an  area  that  we  look  at  at  all  in  our
research,  so  I  am  not  sure  I  am  qualified  to  answer  that  question
very well.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you. Mr. Baron.
Mr.  BARON.  Yes,  I  think  it  is  an  interesting  question.  The  pro-
gram  more  or  less  is  managed  right  now.  The  SBA’s  role  in  man-
aging this program is somewhat limited right now. The program is
managed  more  by  each  of  the  individual  agencies  that  administer
the  program.  They  have  control  over  the  budgets  and  make  most
of  the  decisions  about  program  management.  So  the  SBA  has—
when  I  was  involved  directly  in  the  program  as  the  program  man-
ager  at  DOD,  SBA  played  a  benign  role  and  a  good  role  in  sort  of
setting out the rules. They had a policy directive that helped guide
the  program.  They  did  not  get  involved  in  the  technical  decisions.
Since then, you know, there has been this venture capital question
whether  SBA  ruling  may  not  have  been  the  best  judgment.  But  I
think in general, maybe with that exception, the sort of the current
structure  of  the  program  with  SBA  sort  of  playing  this  facilitative
role has worked reasonably well.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you.  I  noticed  the  staff  in  the  next  row  visi-
bly whispering and you’re handing notes back and forth, but I just
like to hear what you think. Mr. Schmidt?

Mr. SCHMIDT. Yes, Dr. Ehlers, thank you very much. Your ques-
tion is intriguing, but I guess I would have to ask how much inter-
action and how much knowledge do NIST officials have about small
business; and that is one of the keys because they have got to have
that  understanding  of  the  individual  entrepreneur,  of  what  drives
them  and  what  is  taking  this  to  the  next  level.  The  technology  as-
pect  from  NIST  is  probably  better,  but  it  is  this,  you  know—my
house  is  on  the  line,  and  I  have  got  to  make  this  thing  work  that
is  even  more  important  at  that  early  stage  that  we  are  talking
about.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. Dr. McGarrity.
Dr.  MCGARRITY.  Well,  my  previous  company  had  approximately
four  or  five  SBIR  grants  all  from  the  NIH,  and  I  am  probably  one
of  the  world’s  biggest  fans  of  the  NIH.  I  think  it  is  a  shining  star.
So I think as far as the interaction, the ability to judge innovative
research,  I  think  it  is  certainly  there.  So  I  think  there  should  be
flexibility  on  this,  and  as  far  as  my  company’s  actions  with  the
SBA  I  would  go  with  what  Mr.  Baron  said,  they  are  more  or  less
transparent.  There  were  no  dealings  directly  with  them.  Inter-
acting  with  the  NIH  has  always  been  a  pleasure,  and  they  are  ca-
pable  and  competent.  So  I  feel  very,  very  comfortable  about  that
interaction.

Mr. EHLERS. Yeah, and my question probably is least relevant to
NIH  grantees  because  NIST  is  primarily  in  the  physical  sciences.

Dr. MCGARRITY. Yes.
Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Ignagni.
Mr. IGNAGNI. I can echo those comments, because our grants are
through the NIH, and it has been transparent to the SBA, but cer-
tainly  the  flexibility  that  the  NIH  has  experienced  has  been  good.
I think the Medical Device Manufacturers Association would like to
get back with more information as we evaluate that question.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. Well, I was just interested in your comments
in  response  to—I  don’t  know  whether  it  was  Mr.  Baron  or  Mr.
Schmidt.  NIST  does  have  the  expertise.  They  are  using  it  with
MEP and whatever ATP is going to become and what it was in the
past.  They  worked  with  small  businesses,  small  and  medium-sized
was their main aim. And they have good expertise there.

I would not, incidentally, propose that SBA be left completely out
of the loop. They have a very important role to play here, too. But
I  am  just  looking  for  some  way  to  get  uniformity  of  treatment  to-
wards  the  applicants  from  one  field  to  another.  And  that  is  where
NIST  can  play  a  very  good  role  because  they  do  this  all  the  time.
But  also—well,  I  will  leave  that  thought  on  the  table  for  the  mo-
ment.  I  don’t  want  to  start  a  whole  new  field  of  inquiry,  so  I  will
stop  at  this  point.  I  have  probably  done  enough  damage  already.
I yield back. Thank you.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  in  fairness  to  Dr.
Gingrey,  I  am  just  going  to  ask  one  question  and  then  recognize
Dr. Gingrey. A couple of you have recommended increasing the set-
aside  for  SBIR,  and  let  us  say  I  think  one  witness  recommended
doubling  the  set-aside  to  five  percent.  Mr.  Schmidt,  would  increas-
ing  the  set-aside  at  least  partially  address  your  concern  about
where shares of SBIR go to the different kinds of applicants in the
SBIR process?

Mr.  SCHMIDT.  Well,  absolutely.  You  know,  administrative  costs,
certainly if there is more money, the agencies need to get paid like
the rest of us. And so that is very important for that issue. On the
VC issue, though, this is really more of a political issue. I am very
concerned  that  over  time  this  program  could  become  the  billion-
aire’s  funding  program  versus  the  small  business  program.  I  have
absolutely  no  objection  to  a  separate,  similar  side  program  where
VCs are allowed to be able to participate. But what I am concerned
about  is  that  we  are  going  to  politically  put  the  entire  program  at
risk  over  the  years  by  having  this  with  lots  of  large  players  and
a couple of things I want to——

Chairman  WU.  Well,  let  me  turn  to  Mr.  Baron  and  Mr.  Held
about  their  views  of  what  an  increase  in  the  SBIR  percentage
would  mean  in  enlarging  the  program  by  100  percent.  But  Mr.
Schmidt, let me just say that when Congress wants to say 500 em-
ployees, Congress is perfectly capable of saying 500 employees; and
if  Congress  wants  to  address  form  of  corporate  ownership,  then
Congress  is  also  perfectly  capable  of  addressing  it  in  those  terms.
Mr. Baron, Mr. Held?

Mr.  HELD.  What  I  would  like  to  see,  I  think—and  again  my  re-
search is focused on DOD—is more evidence that this is producing
technologies  that  the  DOD  can  use.  That  is  not  to  say  it  is  doing

bad  work  now,  but  that  technology  transition  process  hasn’t  been
working  as  well  as  it  should  be.  So  before  the  set-aside  is  in-
creased,  I  think  we  need  to  fix  that  technology  transition  process
to  get  this  to  be  a  more  effective  and  efficient  program  for  the  De-
partment of Defense.

Chairman WU. This might be more appropriate for some agencies

than for others——

Mr. HELD. Absolutely. Yes.
Mr. BARON. I would echo that in the sense that I think the great-
est  gains,  for  the  reasons  that  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  can
be made by improving the incentives in the program to focus in on
companies  that  are  more  likely  to  convert  research  into  something
that  is  going  to  benefit  the  world,  in  other  words,  the  Defense  De-
partment or the economy. And so that is where I would suggest fo-
cusing  most  effort,  and  I  am  not  sure  that  raising  the  size  of  the
program  by  that  magnitude  would  necessarily  fund  more  compa-
nies  that  have  the  right  kind  of  capabilities  that  you  are  looking
for.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Mr. Baron. Dr. Gingrey.
Mr. GINGREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This question about the
transition  from  Phase  II  to  commercialization  is  a  real  good  one
that  Mr.  Held  and  Mr.  Baron  just  spoke  of,  and  as  I  understand
the program, you have got a Phase I, $100,000 grant, you have got
a  Phase  II,  $750,000  grant,  and  you  have  got  a  Phase  III,  nada
grant,  assuming  that  at  that  point  that  they  are  over  the  hump,
so to speak. But obviously the percentages of these companies, par-
ticularly the start-ups, the ones who don’t have a track record—and
I agree, Mr. Baron, that we have a situation where you focused on
a company with a good track record and you focused on a start-up.
You  try  to  avoid  those  with  a  bad  track  record,  but  is  it  possible
that we need to consider some funding in Phase III? Is that maybe
a  part  of  the  reason  why  there  are  so  many  that  get  grants  in
Phase I or Phase II that never make it to commercialization? They
are  almost  there  but  they  are  not  quite  there?  Maybe  they  need  a
Phase  II–B  or  C  bump,  an  opportunity  to  get  a  little  more  money
to get them where they need to be.

Mr. BARON. I think there is—the incentives in the SBIR Program
are, and I think appropriately, for providing the initial money, the
Phase  I  and  the  Phase  II  with  the  idea  that  in  most  cases  it  is
going to take much more money to get a product to develop, manu-
facture,  further  refine,  et  cetera,  a  product  toward  commercializa-
tion. And SBIR has always been focused on the earliest stage.

That being said, I think there are some excellent ideas that have
been—pilots that have been tried that are designed to help compa-
nies  make  the  transition  to  additional  money.  One  of  them  has
been  piloted  by  the  National  Science  Foundation,  and  there  is  a
similar  version  at  the  Department  of  Defense  which  provides  a
larger  SBIR  Phase  II  award  to  companies  that  get  a  little  bit  of
matching  funds,  matching  cash,  from  a  third  party  investor.  So  it
is a way for the company essentially to take their SBIR money and
leverage  it  to  obtain  additional  outside  money  that  they  will  need
in Phase III. That is called a Phase II–B. I think it is a very prom-
ising  experiment.  Again,  I  would  suggest  I  think  there  is  a  fairly
easy way to test that, whether it actually produces better commer-

cialization  outcomes.  That  gets  back  to  the  evaluation  idea  I  had
in my testimony.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Okay.  So  the  answer  to  my  question  is  that  that

already exists.

Mr. BARON. That is sort of matching and the incentive for match-
ing  funds,  yes,  it  provides  additional  funds  for  Phase  II—you  can
even  call  that  a  Phase  III—coupled  with—conditioned  on  the  com-
pany raising outside funds to match it.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Right,  but  this  would  be  over  and  above  the

$750,000—it would be in addition to that?

Mr. BARON. That is the way that it works at the Defense Depart-
ment.  I  am  not  sure  about  the  National  Science  Foundation,  but
yes.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  wanted  to  ask  another  question.
I see I have a little bit of time left. Mr. Schmidt, in your testimony
you  mentioned  your  experience  with  the  program,  and  it  is  exten-
sive.  And  I  understand—you  and  I  talked  earlier.  You  have  more
than  one  company,  in  fact.  You  have  been  very  successful,  and  I
was  wondering  how  many  grants  your  company  received,  let’s  say
in  the  year  2006,  and,  if  you  know  this,  which  different  agencies
did you receive the awards from? And I would actually at this time,
Mr.  Chairman,  if  Dr.  McGarrity  and  Mr.  Ignagni  could  also  re-
spond to that question.

Mr. SCHMIDT. Well, I don’t have the exact number but it is about
ten to 12. And so obviously this is important to us. One of the ways
in  which  we  helped  leverage  some  of  that  commercialization  fund-
ing  is  that  we  have  spun  off  a  couple  of  new  companies  as  well.
And so we were able to raise outside money from those—from out-
side funds from the spin-off. And that is the way we addressed this,
so we have two other companies that are proceeding with the com-
mercialization there.

Dr.  MCGARRITY.  My  present  company,  VIRxSYS,  as  far  as  I
know,  we  have  never  had  an  SBIR  grant,  and  the  reason  for  that
is—and I am sitting here as a company that is eligible for the pro-
gram.  We  have  focused  all  our  energy,  all  our  resources  on  our
AIDS  treatment.  Now,  however,  we  have  earlier  stage  programs
coming  up,  and  in  all  probability,  we  will  apply  for  an  SBIR  grant
in the summer, the first time. My previous company, Intronn, over
a course of six years, we had approximately four, five SBIR grants.

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Ignagni.
Mr. IGNAGNI. We have—we had one Phase I STTR grant. Unfor-
tunately,  the  market  feasibility  at  the  end  of  that  was  such  that
I  didn’t  feel  was  sufficient  to  proceed  to  a  Phase  II.  The  principal
investigator did submit for Phase II, but I probably dissuaded him
from  doing  that.  We  have  one  Phase  I  that  is  actually  moving  for-
ward  into  a  Phase  II  later  this  year,  and  as  a  matter  of  fact,  we
have  done  some  early  testing  on  a  young  woman  from  Michigan
yesterday in that Phase I and that worked very well.

Mr. GINGREY. You currently have a Phase I——
Mr. IGNAGNI. We have an award pending for a Phase I right now.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman  I  just  wanted  to  ask  Mr.  Schmidt,
if  you  don’t  mind,  if  you  will  submit  that  to  us  for  the  record.  I
know you didn’t have the exact numbers and the different agencies,

but  if  you  would  submit  that  for  the  record  I  would  appreciate  it.
Thank you.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Gingrey,  and  I  am  just  going  to
ask  one  question  of  the  entire  panel  before  turning  back  to  Dr.
Ehlers.  Several  of  you  have  addressed  the  issue  of  award  size.  A
dollar  does  not  buy  the  same  in  2007  that  it  did  in  1992,  and  I
would  like  to  just  go  down  the  row  and  have  you  all  address  the
issue  of  award  size  and  what,  from  a  statutory  perspective,  if  we
were  not  to  provide  a  flexible  cap,  would  provide  enough  moving
room for the next three or four years for a reasonable period of au-
thorization. We will begin with you, Mr. Held.

Mr.  HELD.  Well,  as  I  stated  in  my  testimony,  I  think  at  a  min-
imum  we  need  to  account  for  inflation,  and  if  you  want  to  set  a
limit  that  has  some  flexibility,  you  would  move  up  from  there.  SO
you  know,  perhaps  $200,000  for  a  Phase  I  and  $1.5  million  for  a
Phase II, something along those lines.

Mr.  BARON.  I  think  it  would  make  sense  to  adjust  with  inflation
over  time  but  also—and  I  think  the  current  statute  actually  does
this to allow for a fair amount of flexibility to go over the amount.
In  the  example  that  I  provided,  if  a  company  can  obtain  outside
matching  funds,  some  of  the  agencies  do  allow  you  to  go  over  the
amount. So I think there is a fair amount of flexibility now, but the
base rate might be increased with inflation.

Mr.  SCHMIDT.  This  was  an  extensive  discussion  at  SBTC  and
among their members, and we came down in favor of the $150,000
and $1.25 million goals for these—for the Phase I an Phase II. The
issue becomes, you know, how much do you go above it? And there
was a comment about a $6 million Phase II, and the issue becomes
how many new Phase I’s do you give up for these very large Phase
II’s or don’t deliver your other items. And so what the SBTC’s posi-
tion  was  is  that  there  needs  to  be  certain  guidelines  and  caps  on
that  to  be  able  to  limit  that.  I  think  there  has  got  to  be  flexibility
within  the  agency  that  they  can  do  this  to  fund  those  particular
programs that are most important to them and which seem to them
to  have  the  greatest  scientific  breakthrough,  but  that  is  another
reason  why,  to  go  back  and  reconvene  it  again  on  a  Phase  II  con-
tinuation  or  a  Phase  II–B  or  C,  they  can  get  another  bite  at  the
apple—but they have to show that they chewed the first bite prop-
erly.

Dr.  MCGARRITY.  I  would  agree  with  what  Mr.  Baron  said  as  far
as  at  least  accounting  for  inflation  since  the  last  figure  was  set.
And I would also echo his sentiments that, you know, the Congress
and  the  SBA  shouldn’t  micromanage  this.  I  think  you  should  set
the  guidelines,  and  they  are  appropriate;  but  give  the  agency  the
flexibility  if  they  have  to  and  if  it  is  justified  to  go  over  the  dollar
amount  for  particular  awards,  if  it  is  justified  on  either  a  piece  of
equipment or a special case or something to have that ability to ad-
dress  the  needs  of  the  particular  grants  and  their  overall  program
and mission.

Mr.  IGNAGNI.  Again,  in  agreement  down  the  line  here.  We  advo-
cated  a  $150,000  limit  for  Phase  I.  Our  guideline  for  Phase  I  as
well  is  one-fourth  million.  And  just  to  note  that  with  NIH  grants,
there  is  flexibility.  WE  have—as  long  as  the  budget  is  justified,
well-justified  and  they  have  the  ability  to  come  back  and  say  no,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

71

we  disagree  with  your  justification  and  you  should  get  X  amount
of  dollars;  but  ours  have  been  well-justified.  We  have  gotten  30  to
50 percent over the guideline in our two grants.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  all  very  much.  While  I  am  sympa-
thetic to granting agency flexibility, sometimes—well, it depends on
what  they  do  with  that  flexibility.  And  you  know,  Dr.  McGarrity,
you  might  be  a  little  bit  concerned  about  the  claimed  flexibility
about  capital  structure  and  the  interpretation  there.  Mr.  Schmidt,
I  appreciate  your  discussion  of  a  higher  limit  of  $6  million;  and
while  I  personally  think  that  an  adjustment  above  the  inflation
rate  is  warranted  because  in  working  with  SBIR  folks  before  I
came to Congress, that was a tremendous amount of work to do for
a  modicum  of  money  and  that  perhaps  an  above-inflation  adjust-
ment  rate  might  be  warranted.  But  we  might  not  be  able  to  hit
that $6 million mark. With that, Dr. Gingrey, further questions?

Mr.  GINGREY.  I  would  like  to  go  back  to  Mr.  Schmidt  in  regard
to  this  issue  of  venture  capitalists  MAT  companies,  and  I  know
that  you  are—in  your  testimony,  I  know  you  have  some  concerns
over  that;  and  you  don’t  think  they  should  be  eligible  and  are
therefore  in  agreement  with  the  ruling  of  the  SBA  back  in  2003.
And  I  really  wonder  if  your  thoughts  that  nine  different  agencies
that participate with the 2.5 percent set-aside maybe should be in-
creased. And you were talking—used the analogy of the bite of the
apple. Let me use one. I am not sure that we are comparing apples
to  apples  in  regard  to  the  issue  that  Mr.  Ignagni  and  Dr.
McGarrity raised, because of the type of business that they are in-
volved in. I guess those grants would come through the NIH in the
biomedical  field,  and  the  necessity  of  trying  to  raise  some  capital
just to get off the ground almost forces them to go in that direction
unless  there  are  a  lot  of  angel  investors  around.  If  I  had  to  look
for  an  angel  investor  in  my  family,  I  would  be  dead  in  the  water.
And so I just wonder maybe if in your logic on this, if you would
not  agree  that  maybe  you  treat  these  apples  and  oranges  a  little
bit  differently.  In  some  situations,  some  agencies  that  participate
in  this  program,  maybe  that  rule  would  make  sense,  but  in  others
specifically,  the  funding  through  the  NIH  wouldn’t  make  sense.
Comment on that.

Mr. SCHMIDT. Congressman Gingrey, I just wanted to clarify one
thing just to make sure everyone is on the same page. The current
rules  from  ’52  before  the  SBIR  program  to  ’82  with  the  SBIR  Pro-
gram,  and  the  rules  have  been  the  rules  all  the  time,  do  not  pro-
hibit  VC  ownership,  small  VCs  with  less  than  500  employees  com-
bined,  from  owning  a  majority  of  the  shares.  So  they  can  own  99
percent of the shares under the current rules, as long as their con-
glomeration is less than 500 employees.

The second thing is that a large VC with more than 500 employ-
ees  underneath  their  domain  can  own  49.99  percent.  So  the  only
thing that is prohibited is large VCs having majority ownership. So
you  know,  that  is  the  only  thing  we  are  talking  about  with  this.
The  second  thing  to  answer  your  question  previously  is  whether
things  have  gone  down  since  this  ruling.  The  GAO  report  in  2006
showed the percentage of venture-supported companies at the NIH
has increased in the two years following the SBA clarification, and
we  can  make  that  available.  So  that  is  not  reduced  VC  funding  at

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

72

the NIH at all. So the only thing that they are prohibiting is major-
ity ownership by large VCs.

So  I  guess  I  look  at  this  and  say,  you  know,  should  you  make
an  exception  for  the  NIH?  Well,  what  I  would  suggest  instead  is
having  another  similar  program.  We  have  STTR,  we  have  SBIR,
and  I  would  suggest  a  growing  businesses  innovation  research  or
other  similar  kind  of  program  where  this  VC  rule  does  not  apply,
that you can allow those people in that program; and that way we
do not mix these individuals and this program because, Represent-
ative Gingrey, you asked about your friend, you know, that the one
person  got  it.  And  I  was  one  of  those  guys.  When  I  started  with
the  companies,  it  was  me  and  my  wastebasket.  And  I  kept  yelling
at  my  wastebasket  that  it  wasn’t  producing  the  reports  I  needed.
Of course, you work these 80 to 100 weeks for years on end. I mean
you  get  one,  two  days  off,  in  a  quarter  and  that’s  a  big  deal.  So,
in  going  through  all  of  this,  the  SBIR  Program  provides  for  those
small companies, and the majority of their companies are under 20
employees. So that’s what the SBIR program does. So by including
large  VCs  into  this  and  having  majority  ownership,  you  are  going
to  make  it  that  much  harder  for  that  individual  guy  to  be  able  to
get  up  and  run.  So  if  you  have  a  parallel  program,  that  is  some-
thing that, we can live with, there is more money for that. I mean,
I  spend  a  lot  of  time  in  Cleveland  arguing  for  angel  groups,  and
I am an angel in two different groups. And having more VC money
into our area. I mean, I argue all the time for that. It is a big deal.
It  is  important.  But  to  take  the  SBIR  Program  and  change  that
purpose,  my  opinion  and  the  opinion  of  the  SBTC  and  the  NSBA
is that that would be a mistake.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  going  to  yield  back  to  you.  I

think if you want to——

respond to that.

Chairman  WU.  Mr.  Ignagni,  I  believe  you  may  have  wanted  to

Mr.  IGNAGNI.  I  just  have  one  point  that  I  think  is  a  part  of  the
confusion  around  this  argument.  It  is  the  example—and  Mr.
Schmidt  brings  up  the  small  VC  versus  the  large  VC;  and  I  really
don’t know what that means. I mean, a small VC company in Palo
Alto, California, three large partners, six people, six partners in the
firm  with  several  assistants  and  everything.  But  they  get  money
from Ford Motor Company’s pension fund to invest some small por-
tion, and there are however many people. This is a hypothetical ex-
ample.  But  they  are  affiliates,  and  it  is  written  as  employees  over
affiliates.  I  don’t  know  if  there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  small  VC.  As
soon as they become an institutional investor and get money from,
whether it is University Hospitals pension fund or just some other
larger  company  that  is  investing  in  them,  I  think  they  are  consid-
ered  affiliates;  and  that  would  make  my  life  a  lot  easier  if  it  were
just the number of employees at the VC firm.

Dr.  MCGARRITY.  And  just  another  supplement  to  that,  the  word-
ing  is  that  it  has  to  be  owned  by  51  percent  of  individuals,  and  I
think  a  significant  change  was  whether  the  VCs  were  listed  as  in-
dividuals as they were in the past or now that they don’t count as
individuals, you have to have ownership by individual people. Actu-
ally, if you go back to the original investment legislation, that legis-
lation  actually  said  that  investment  firms  would  be  counted  as  in-

dividuals,  and  the  legislation  that  introduced  the  SBIR  was  actu-
ally  mute  on  that  point.  So  I  think  maybe  that  is  the  reason  why
this  has  been  so  vague  and  open  to  interpretation  through  the
years.

Chairman  WU.  Well,  as  we  proceed  I  think  that  we  will  focus  a
substantial amount of attention on this form of corporate organiza-
tion and whether it is relevant or not to small business definitions
and the SBIR Program.

There  has  been  some  discussion—one  of  the  strengths  I  view  of
the SBIR program is a relative uniformity of cross-federal agencies
in  terms  of  a  percentage  set  aside  that  it  is  handled.  There  has
been  some  discussion  today  of  different  percentage  set-asides  for
different  agencies  and  perhaps  handling  this  VC  issue  differently
between  different  agencies.  Mr.  Held,  Mr.  Baron,  do  you  see  prob-
lems  where  they’re  starting  to  treat  different  agencies  differently
under the SBIR program or the STTR program?

Mr.  BARON.  Yes.  I  think  you  want  some  flexibility  but  different
agencies  have  different  missions,  needs,  and  so  forth.  But  the  uni-
formity  as  you  mentioned  in  your  question,  some  degree  of  uni-
formity  has  a  real  purpose.  This  program  is  for  companies  most—
is  intended  for  a  lot  of  companies  that  have  never  done  business
with  the  government  before  and  don’t  know  all  about  arcane  rules
of  government  granting  and  contracting  and  all  of  that.  You  want
the process to be, I would think, as simple and streamlined as pos-
sible  and  to  have  a  set  of  fairly  clear  rules  across  the  agencies,
similar  sizes  of  awards,  proposals  limited  to  25  pages.  It  serves  a
great  benefit  in  allowing—in  making  the  process  more  merit-ori-
ented  and  not  less  oriented  on  knowing  the  nuances  of  how  each
individual agency’s rules operate.

Mr.  HELD.  Yeah,  I  think  I  generally  agree  with  that.  There  is  a
lot  of  advantage  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  in  terms  of  making  it
easy for small businesses to participate in the program, to have as
much  uniformity  as  you  can  across  the  government.  Having  said
that, there has to be flexibility in the program to structure each in-
dividual agency’s program so that it can best meet the goals of that
particular agency.

You  look,  for  example,  within  DOD,  there  are  agencies  like  the,
DARPA,  Defense  Advance  Research  Project  Agency  that  does  very
risky,  very  far-out  kind  of  research;  and  then  there  are  the  Armed
Services  which  are  trying  to  get  things  fairly  near-term  into  the
hands of soldiers and airmen and sailors and marines and so forth.
And  the  program,  because  it  draws  from  each  of  those  agencies,
has  to  be  able  to  have  the  flexibility  to  manage  those  different
goals.

Chairman WU. Mr. Schmidt.
Mr. SCHMIDT. Mr. Wu, just one example in our little sleep moni-
toring  device,  we  developed  a  radio  underneath  NIH  funding.  We
then  took  that  radio  and  put  it  on  missiles  for  the  Air  Force.  We
improved  the  radio  and  then  put  it  back  into  this  device,  and  we
are  now  coming  up  with  a  fifth  generation  radio  to  be  able  to  go
back  into  the  military  and  other  places.  We  are  doing  brain  moni-
toring  from  NIH  and  now  applying  it  for  Homeland  Security  and
Department of Defense issues after a chemical warfare attack. The
problem  is  that  it  is  most  beneficial  for  the  Nation  to  be  able  to

take these technologies and move them across. If you have different
rules  for  different  agencies  and  you  say,  oh,  you  have  got  51  per-
cent funding from a VC, you are okay over here, but you know, you
are  going  to  hit  that  wall  right  there  when  you  are  trying  to  take
that  over  to  another  agency,  I  think  that  would  be  detrimental  for
overall technology development.

Chairman WU. Mr. Ignagni.
Mr. IGNAGNI. I think uniformity and DMA thinks that uniformity
is good, but unfortunately in the NIH, and the amount that it takes
to do a clinical trial, to get a clinical trial started, is very substan-
tial;  and  to  get  a  device  through  all  of  the  compliance  require-
ments,  all  of  the  certifications  that  you  need  to  get  into  human
trials, or animal trials for that matter, is expensive.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  all  very  much.  We  have  tapped  at
least  most  of  the  horses  that  we  need  to  tap  as  we  go  forward  in
the  legislative  process.  We  are  at  risk  of  reflogging  some  of  those
horses  now,  and  I  want  to  thank  all  the  witnesses  for  a  very,  very
productive  hearing;  and  thank  you  very,  very  much  for  being  here
today. If there is no objection, the record will remain open for addi-
tional  statements  from  Members,  for  questions  or  answers  to  the
witnesses or from any Committee Members; and without objection,
so  ordered,  and  the  hearing  is  now  adjourned.  Thank  you  all  very,
very much.

[Whereupon, at 3:05 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Bruce J. Held, Director of the Force Development and Technology Pro-

gram, Rand Arroyo Center, The Rand Corporation

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  comment  about  DOD’s  solicitation  schedule  and  rec-
ommend  more  frequent  solicitations  to  provide  flexibility  to  meet  DOD  tech-
nology needs in a timely manner. What do you estimate would be the additional
administrative cost of this flexibility? Do you think there is an appropriate legis-
lative solution for this?

A1. Under  current  procedures,  the  additional  administrative  cost  could  be  substan-
tial, though additional study is merited to determine what that cost would be. Cur-
rent procedures issue a service/agency-wide call for topics. Submitted topics then are
modified  and  approved  through  various  levels  of  command  and  management;  ulti-
mately the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering provides the
final  approval.  This  centralized  process  is  administratively  burdensome,  so  most
agencies  and  services  limit  their  topic  proposal  and  SBIR  solicitation  exercise  to
only one or two of the regularly scheduled DOD SBIR solicitations per year in order
to  improve  process  efficiency.  Increasing  solicitation  frequency  should,  therefore,  be
linked  to  other  SBIR  program  reforms  intended  to  improve  overall  flexibility  and
utilization of research outcomes.

Potential  legislative  solutions  could  include  providing  for  final  topic  approval  at
a  level  lower  than  the  DOD  level.  This  would  allow  the  services/agencies  to  signifi-
cantly  stream-line  the  topic  approval  process.  Additionally,  legislation  could  man-
date  an  ‘‘open’’  solicitation,  at  either  the  service/agency  level  or  at  the  DOD  level,
to  which  SBIR  topics  could  be  added  at  any  time.  Given  the  current  sophistication
of  available  Internet  search  and  alert  tools,  an  open  SBIR  solicitation  would  have
the  same  effect  as  regularly  scheduled  solicitations  in  providing  small  businesses  a
simple means for learning about opportunities available in the program.
Q2. What  improvements  would  you  recommend  in  the  award  application  process
which would lower application costs for small businesses and reduce the funding
gap between Phase I and II awards?

A2. It is not clear that the application process for Phase I awards could be improved
significantly to lower application costs without detracting from competition or reduc-
ing  the  amount  information  required  to  make  informed  award  decisions  and  collect
information  necessary  to  manage  and  monitor  the  SBIR  program.  Phase  II  award
costs  could  be  reduced  in  some  cases  by  making  Phase  II  an  option  on  the  initial
Phase I contract. (The term ‘‘option’’ as used here is different than the Phase I Op-
tion  program  that  provides  bridge  funding  when  a  Phase  II  award  is  anticipated.)
This would also have the added benefit of reducing the funding gap between Phase
I  and  Phase  II.  Rather  than  have  the  small  businesses  prepare  a  second  proposal
and enter into a second contract, a Phase II option would allow contracting officers
to  simply  exercise  the  option  upon  successful  completion  of  Phase  I  and  a  decision
by the benefited command, program office, laboratory or research center to continue
the work.

Since  Phase  I  studies  are  usually  feasibility  studies,  managing  Phase  II  awards
as options on the Phase I contract will require some additional work and innovation
in  drafting  and  negotiating  the  Phase  I  contract.  For  example,  there  would  need  to
be provisions that allow for adjustments in the technical direction of the project and
in  the  anticipated  cost  of  Phase  II.  Nevertheless,  the  additional  effort  could  be  re-
warded by much less effort in making Phase II awards and a much reduced funding
gap between research phases.
Q3. You  make  the  case  for  flexible  program  administration,  including  award  size.
In  addition  to  award  size,  what  other  specific  areas  of  program  administration
would  benefit  from  flexibility?  Please  describe  how  flexibility  should  be  imple-
mented? Is there a need for statutory change?

A3. I  mentioned  above,  in  answer  to  Question  1,  that  solicitations  should  be  more
frequent,  or  there  should  be  some  provision  for  an  ‘‘open’’  solicitation  to  make  the
initiation  of  SBIR  research  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  DOD’s  technology
customers.  In  addition,  the  actual  schedule  and  pace  of  the  research  should  be  re-
sponsive  to  the  requirements  of  the  DOD  technology  customer  and  to  the  progress
of the research. For example, in some cases, Phase I might require very little time.
By  using  a  Phase  II  contract  option,  as  I  described  in  Question  2,  Phase  II  could

77

be  started  very  quickly.  Depending  on  the  research,  such  an  approach  would  have
the benefit of moving the technology through research and development much more
quickly.

I  believe  the  current  SBIR  law  already  allows  enough  flexibility  with  regard  to
project  and  solicitation  schedule  flexibility.  At  issue  are  established  procedures  for
managing the SBIR program in DOD. These procedures evolved mainly in response
to  process  efficiency  requirements.  Legislation  that  requires  administrative  funding
for the SBIR program to be drawn from the SBIR set-aside could change the incen-
tives  that  make  process  efficiency  in  the  DOD  SBIR  program  more  important  than
research utilization.

Flexibility  concerning  the  kinds  of  research  and  development  appropriate  to  the
SBIR program would also be very useful. The word ‘‘innovation’’ does not just mean
cutting-edge science and technology. In fact, and as currently recognized in the law,
one common interpretation of innovation is the development of existing science and
technology  for  new  uses.  Some  examples  of  how  to  be  more  innovative  about  ‘‘inno-
vation’’ are illustrative.

a. The  SBIR  program  could  be  a  particularly  effective  resource  for  conducting
engineering  improvement  programs  for  already  fielded  items  of  equipment.
Program  offices  managing  fielded  equipment,  particularly  when  there  is  no
product improvement program approved, usually have very few resources for
improving the equipment they manage; for example, developing more robust
components  to  replace  ones  that  wear  out  quickly.  The  SBIR  program  can
be  this  kind  of  resource,  providing  development  funds  that  potentially  im-
prove equipment performance and save other resources.

b. The SBIR program could be engineered into a resource for the rapid develop-
ment  of  technology  urgently  needed  by  deployed  forces.  Though  there  are
other programs and processes to do this, realigning funding can be time con-
suming. The SBIR program could be an accessible source of innovation fund-
ing that doesn’t need reprogramming.

c. Provide  SBIR  awards  to  take  a  technology  through  several  steps  in  develop-
ment. For example, a Phase I and II award might be used to develop a brass-
board prototype of a technology, a second Phase I and II might take the tech-
nology  from  brass-board  to  operational  prototype  and  a  third  Phase  I  and  II
might provide for full up testing and product refinement. (There are some ef-
forts along these lines now.)

A broad, legislative restatement of what is meant by innovation and how that ap-
plies  to  the  SBIR  program  would  help  resolve  debate  about  the  appropriate  use  of
SBIR resources.
Q4. What  specific  percentage  administrative  cost  recovery  of  the  SBIR  set-aside  dol-
lars  do  you  recommend  and  what  types  of  administrative  costs  would  you  in-
clude; what would you exclude?

A4. There  are  a  number  of  research  management  comparisons  that  can  be  used  to
develop  an  estimate  for  a  specific  percentage  administrative  cost  recovery  of  the
SBIR  set-aside  dollars.  For  example,  the  Navy’s  SBIR  program  appears  to  be  more
successful  in  commercializing  its  research  results.  That  program  taxes  its  RDT&E
accounts an additional 6.5 percent of the value of the SBIR set-aside to fund admin-
istrative  and  commercialization  costs.  Commercial  venture  capitalists  draw  an  an-
nual management fee that averages about 2.5 percent of funds under management,
plus  they  earn  a  significant  portion  (∼20  percent)  of  any  return  on  investment  that
is  earned.  In  the  DOD,  the  account  for  RDT&E  Management  Support  averaged
nearly  eight  percent  between  FY  2000  and  FY  2008.  Based  on  these  benchmarks,
I recommend that the percentage administrative cost recovery of the SBIR set-aside
dollars be at least six percent, and perhaps even higher.

Administrative cost recovery funds should be allowed to address most administra-
tive  costs  associated  with  managing  the  SBIR  program,  including  contract  manage-
ment, topic and solicitation writing, proposal evaluation, technical support and over-
sight, and the programmatics associated with integrating SBIR research with other
acquisition and R&D programs.

Whether  administrative  cost  recovery  funds  should  be  allowed  to  fund  business
development  activities  for  participating  DOD  SBIR  companies  is  a  matter  that  re-
quires  more  research  and  explicit  policy  decisions  concerning  these  kinds  of  activi-
ties.  In  fact,  current  law  already  allows  some  SBIR  funds  to  be  used  for  these  pur-
poses.
Q5. In your written testimony, you say there are Department of Defense SBIR award
winners  in  what  you  describe  as  ‘‘research  houses’’  who  provide  research  as  a

service but without the ultimate goal to develop a marketable product. Why don’t
these  firms  focus  on  commercialization?  How  widespread  is  this  practice?  What
can be done to focus on the commercialization goals of the SBIR program?

A5. The  business  model  of  these  firms  is  to  provide  a  service,  and  that  service  is
research.  Firms  that  focus  on  research  as  service  do  so  because  selling  research
services  can  be  a  successful  business  model.  Research  is  also  what  motivates  the
people  in  these  firms  rather  than  the  other  tasks  that  go  into  commercialization,
such  as  marketing,  sales,  product  development  and  manufacture.  Research  services
like  this  are  also  important  to  organizations  that  require  the  work  but  don’t  have
an in-house capability for it and, for any number of reasons, do not want to develop
the capability.

In the SBIR program, research houses can be very valuable contributors, provided
that  their  work  will  ultimately  result  in  a  product,  process  or  technology  used  by
the  DOD.  A  mechanism  for  enforcing  this  requirement  is  available  in  the  Commer-
cialization Achievement Index (CAI). Research houses that conduct numerous SBIR
projects should be able to achieve reasonable CAIs through licensing fees, follow-on
research contracts and other additional investment from companies interested in the
technology.  Those  that  do  not  achieve  reasonable  CAIs  should  not  continue  to  re-
ceive SBIR awards.

Our research did not examine how widespread this business model is.
Getting  more 

the  commercialization  goals  will  require  more
‘‘mainstreaming’’  of  the  DOD  SBIR  program  into  the  acquisition  activities  of  the
DOD. So long as most of the DOD SBIR program is managed from the laboratories
and R&D centers, technology transition and commercialization will remain difficult.
Management  of  the  program  should  be  more  aligned  with  sources  of  SBIR  funds.
Since the DOD’s acquisition programs provide most SBIR funds (6.4 and 6.5 dollars
represent  the  largest  categories  of  DOD  RDT&E  funding)  this  kind  of  alignment
would  give  acquisition  program  managers  greater  control  of  SBIR  funds  and
projects.  In  keeping  with  my  theme  above,  if  acquisition  managers  are  given  more
control of SBIR projects, they should also be given the resources to adequately man-
age and integrate the research into their programs.

It  should  be  recognized  that  in  recent  years  there  have  been  efforts  to  make  the
DOD’s acquisition community more involved in the SBIR program. With the possible
exception  of  the  Navy,  these  efforts  remain  inadequate,  however,  and  more  needs
to be done.
Q6. You recommend increasing the role of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) acqui-
sition  staff  in  managing  SBIR  projects,  such  as  in  award  topic  selection.  What
are the current best practices in DOD which support integration with DOD’s ac-
quisition processes? Is a change in the statute needed?

focus  on 

A6. The  Navy  currently  provides  examples  of  best  practices.  It  does  a  number  of
things  differently,  and  these  appear  to  have  had  an  impact  on  commercialization
success.

First, the Navy directly funds SBIR technology transition management. It collects
an additional .1625 percent on top of the 2.5 percent of extramural R&D to provide
funding for technology transition assistance and management.

Second, the Navy participates in all four DOD SBIR solicitations.
Third,  the  Navy’s  philosophy  concerning  use  of  SBIR  resources  seems  to  be  that
organizations  should  benefit  from  the  program  more  in  relation  to  the  contribution
they make toward the program.

Fourth,  the  Navy  has  personnel  at  each  SYSCOM/PEO  funded  by  and  dedicated

to managing the SBIR program.

Fifth,  the  Navy’s  leadership  appears  to  be  pushing  management  of  SBIR  projects
down through the PEO structure to individual program management offices (PMO).
This is currently most evident in NAVSEA and NAVAIR, where topic selection, pro-
posal  review,  and  project  oversight  are  managed  by  personnel  in  the  PMOs  and
PEOs,  rather  than  the  laboratories  and  R&D  centers.  This  greatly  increases  the
chances  that  a  particular  project  will  be  responsive  to  the  needs  of  an  acquisition
activity.

Legislation that could support these kinds of best practices include:

a. Allowing funding of SBIR administration costs from the SBIR ‘‘tax’’ on extra

mural R&D.

b. Requiring  some  percentage  of  SBIR  projects  be  managed  by  the  acquisition
community. The actual percentage should probably be made a function of the
SBIR tax the programs in each PEO pay into the SBIR program.

79

c. Legislatively defining ‘‘innovation’’ and ‘‘commercialization’’ such that pursuit
of  the  SBIR  program’s  innovation  and  commercialization  goals  will  nec-
essarily require more participation by the acquisition community.

d. Requiring  greater  application  of  commercialization  achievements  as  a  pro-

posal evaluation criterion.

Q7. You  describe  the  DOD  SBIR  leadership  focus  is  on  statutory  compliance  rather
than research outcome and utilization. Given this assessment, what is your view
on doubling the size of the SBIR program? You also suggest the question around
increasing  small  business  participation  should  be  on  increasing  the  quality  of
the  participation  not  the  overall  number  of  companies  participating.  Is  this  a
current problem?

A7. The  DOD  SBIR  program  should  not  be  doubled  in  size  until  and  unless  it  is
demonstrated  that  the  results  of  the  research  are  being  incorporated  into  DOD
equipment,  processes,  or  other  DOD  R&D  activities.  This  demonstration  requires
that  appropriate  and  measurable  metrics  be  defined  and  goals  established  that
benchmark acceptable SBIR research utilization success.

The  most  consistent  complaint  we  heard  from  the  small  business  SBIR  program
participants  was  that  there  was  no  path  to  take  their  research  forward  after  the
end  of  each  project.  Therefore,  by  ‘‘quality  of  participation,’’  I  mean  that  SBIR  re-
search  projects  should  be  selected  and  managed  so  that  they  directly  support  and
are  integratable  into  DOD  acquisition  programs  and  research  initiatives.  This  kind
of  participation  is  much  more  likely  to  result  in  the  results  of  the  research  being
incorporated into DOD equipment or contributing to important research efforts. Too
often,  SBIR  projects  today  are  managed  as  something  outside  mainstream  efforts
and  result  only  in  reports  that  are  rarely  read  after  the  conclusion  of  the  project.
Simply  increasing  the  number  of  small  business  participants  will  not  relieve  this
issue.  On  the  other  hand,  if  SBIR  projects  are  perceived  as  valuable  contributors
to acquisition program success or to research that leads to future acquisitions, then
demand  for  SBIR  resources  will  increase,  and  more  small  businesses  will  seek  par-
ticipation in the program.
Q8. What do you see are the most significant data gaps with respect to program eval-
uation  and  the  most  effective  ways  to  address  these  gaps  in  the  future?  Who
needs  to  gather  this  information,  and  what  are  the  impediments  to  compiling
this information today?

A8. The DOD SBIR program currently collects sales and additional investment data
from  companies  that  previously  participated  in  the  federal  SBIR  program  and  are
making a new SBIR proposal. This data can provide insights into whether SBIR re-
search is being used in the development of military equipment. Additional data that
is more specific on actual use could provide greater insight. Such data might include
the  specific  examples  of  use,  time  to  use  and  TRL  levels.  Actual  metrics,  however,
will  require  additional  development  to  determine  what  information  can  be  feasibly
collected. Whatever metrics are ultimately required, they need to be collected on an
on-going  basis  and  would  best  be  collected  by  SBIR  managers  assigned  to  specific
PM/PEO offices, laboratories and R&D centers.

The  ability  to  collect  adequate  data  for  assessing  the  DOD  SBIR  program  is  cur-
rently impeded by two things. First, metrics for assessing SBIR program success are
ill-defined and actual reporting requirements are focused on program execution. Sec-
ond,  the  resources  dedicated  to  managing  the  SBIR  program  are  too  few  to  ade-
quately  evaluate  and  oversee  the  program  much  beyond  the  execution  metrics  that
are reported up through the DOD, to the SBA and ultimately to Congress.
Q9. Please  recommend  how  you  would  structure  on-going  administrative  oversight
and  evaluation  of  the  DOD  SBIR  program?  Are  these  recommendations  appro-
priate to other SBIR agencies?

A9. Oversight  of  the  SBIR  program  needs  to  be  more  closely  tied  to  the  program’s
legislative purpose. In order to make this possible, specific criteria and benchmarks
that  are  directly  related  to  the  program’s  legislative  purpose  must  be  established,
and  metrics  that  can  be  used  to  assess  how  well  the  SBIR  program  is  addressing
the criteria and meeting the benchmarks must be developed, and the data collected.
Reporting  requirements  for  the  SBIR  program  also  need  to  be  more  closely  tied  to
the legislative priorities for the program.

In addition, the structure of SBIR oversight and evaluation responsibilities should
more  closely  align  to  the  legislative  priorities.  For  two  of  the  services  and  to  some
extent  at  the  DOD  level,  much  of  the  oversight  and  evaluation  responsibility  is  es-
tablished in Science and Technology organizations, such as the Office of the Director
of  Defense  Research  and  Engineering  (DDRE)  and  the  Director  for  Research  and

Laboratory  Management  in  the  Army.  These  organizations  certainly  have  a  stake
in  the  SBIR  program  and  should  retain  organizational  responsibility  for  oversight
and  evaluation  of  SBIR  projects  that  are  comparable  to  research  conducted  under
the DOD’s RDT&E research categories 6.1 through 6.3. However, acquisition organi-
zations  should  have  organizational  responsibility  for  oversight  and  evaluation  of
SBIR  projects  that  are  comparable  to  research  conducted  under  the  DOD’s  RDT&E
6.4, 6.5 and 6.7 research categories.

The DOD’s current SBIR management structure is too lean to provide more than
program  execution  oversight  and  some  level  of  policy  guidance.  Adequate  oversight
of  SBIR  program  utilization  is  not  practicable  without  sufficient  information  to  in-
form  evaluation  and  people  to  actually  conduct  evaluations.  Since  the  DOD  SBIR
program  consists  of  two  to  four  thousand  on-going  projects  and  many  thousands  of
completed  projects,  and  because  these  are  research  projects  whose  transition  into
fielded products is a very complex process, evaluating success is necessarily a labor
intensive endeavor. That is one reason why I recommend at least six percent of the
program  funds  be  set-aside  for  administrative  costs.  More  personnel  are  needed  at
the DOD level, the service/agency level and the major command/PEO level to collect,
analyze and report progress in the DOD SBIR program.

Administrative  oversight  and  evaluation  of  the  SBIR  program  should  be  struc-
tured to the purpose of the parent organization. Since these purposes vary, and our
research  did  not  examine  other  SBIR  organizations  in  detail,  I  cannot  comment  on
how they should structure their SBIR program oversight and evaluation.
Q10. Looking  at  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA),  how  well  has  SBA  done  to
date  in  providing  management  and  oversight  of  the  SBIR  program?  What  do
you recommend to improve management and oversight?

A10. Our research did not examine SBA practices with regard to the SBIR program,
so I cannot comment on Question 10.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jon  Baron,  Executive  Director,  Coalition  for  Evidence-Based  Policy,

Council for Excellence in Government

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. How should we address the situation of recipients of multiple SBIR awards who
have no record of commercialization? How widespread is this practice, and what
has  been  the  impact  on  the  program?  How  could  award  criteria  be  revised  and
applied  by  review  committees  to  be  sure  prior  award  and  commercialization  ex-
perience is considered by the review panel?

A1. The  GAO  studies  of  the  SBIR  program,  and  DOD  data,  show  that  some  SBIR
companies—perhaps  as  many  as  half  of  those  that  have  participated  long  enough
to  build  a  track  record—consistently  are  unable  to  convert  their  SBIR  awards  into
viable new products sold to commercial or government customers.

To ensure that an SBIR applicant’s prior award and commercialization experience
is  considered  by  agency  review  panels,  I’d  suggest  that  an  applicant’s  track  record
in commercializing its prior SBIR awards comprise at least 30 percent of its evalua-
tion  score.  As  noted  in  my  testimony,  some  agencies  such  as  DOD  collect  excellent
data  on  companies’  commercialization  track  records,  which  could  readily  be  used  in
this process.

This  criterion  would  only  apply  to  applicants  that  have  won  a  sizable  number  of
prior  SBIR  awards  (e.g.,  at  least  three  prior  phase  II  awards);  thus  applicants  that
are  relatively  new  to  the  SBIR  program  would  not  be  affected  by  this  policy.  (An
agency  could  even  give  such  new  SBIR  applicants  a  competitive  priority—e.g.,  10
extra points out of 100—if the agency wishes to encourage their participation in the
program.)
Q2. You  describe  firms  who  are  consistently  unable  to  convert  their  SBIR  awards
into viable new projects. You provide examples of agency approaches to improve
SBIR  award  company  entrepreneurial  skills.  Would  you  please  identify  which
approaches you believe are most effective?

A2. I  think  the  most  promising  approaches  are  to  incentivize  firms  to  (i)  hire  indi-
viduals with the experience and motivation to commercialize, and (ii) give these in-
dividuals a key role in running the company. Suggested incentives are discussed in
response to the next question. Based on my experience and discussions with compa-
nies  that  have  been  highly  successful  in  commercialization,  I  believe  that  bringing
such  experienced  individuals  into  the  company  is  likely  to  be  more  effective  than
training or providing other assistance to existing company personnel who have little
background in commercialization.
Q3. What  types  of  incentives  do  you  recommend  to  significantly  improve  commer-
cialization?  Please  also  describe  how  these  incentives  should  be  administered,
considering the different skill sets of award winners.

A3. Revising the SBIR proposal evaluation criteria to give greater weight to an ap-
plicant’s  commercialization  track  record,  as  described  under  question  1,  would  be  a
powerful incentive.

Another  strong  incentive  would  be  to  provide  a  larger  phase  II  award,  and/or  a
competitive priority in the phase II proposal evaluation process, to SBIR companies
that  obtain  at  least  a  partial  match  of  funds  (cash,  not  in-kind)  from  a  third-party
investor.  The  National  Science  Foundation’s  ‘‘Phase  II–B’’  award,  and  DOD’s  ‘‘Fast
Track’’  and  ‘‘Phase  II  Enhancement’’  policies  are  specific  versions  of  this  approach.
The  rationale  for  this  approach  is  that  an  investor’s  hard  commitment  of  matching
funds  is  a  strong  endorsement  of  the  SBIR  company’s  entrepreneurial  capabilities
and the market size (commercial or military) for its technology. The National Acad-
emy  of  Sciences’  study  of  DOD’s  Fast  Track  provides  initial  evidence  that  this  ap-
proach yields much higher commercialization and research outcomes.

You might consider including both of these incentives in the reauthorization legis-

lation.
Q4. What  do  you  think  would  be  the  impact  of  doubling  the  size  of  the  SBIR  pro-
gram  by  increasing  the  set-aside  to  five  percent,  including  the  impact  on  the
competitiveness  of  the  awards  and  the  potential  for  commercialization  of  the
projects?

A4. I  think  it’s  hard  to  project  the  impact  of  doubling  the  SBIR  set-aside.  I  think
it  might  be  more  productive  for  the  reauthorization  bill  to  focus  on  revising  the  in-

centives  in  the  existing  SBIR  program,  as  discussed  above,  because  there’s  strong
reason  to  believe  that  doing  so  could  greatly  increase  the  program’s  contribution  to
American technological and economic capabilities.
Q5. You  recommend  agencies  be  directed  to  allocate  one  percent  of  SBIR  funds  to
conduct scientifically rigorous evaluations of new approaches to build awardees’
entrepreneurial  skills?  What  information  is  required  and  is  it  feasible  to  collect
this information? Who do you recommend conduct these evaluations?

A5. As  I  discuss  in  my  testimony,  scientifically  rigorous  evaluations  of  new  ap-
proaches  to  administering  the  SBIR  program—such  as  the  incentives  I  describe
above—are  often  feasible  at  modest  cost  and  with  minimal  administrative  burden.
For  example,  an  agency  could  randomly  assign  half  of  its  SBIR  awardees  to  a
‘‘treatment’’ group that is eligible for a larger phase II award if it obtains matching
funds  from  a  third-party  investor  (as  is  done  under  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion’s  ‘‘Phase  II–B’’  process),  and  its  other  awardees  to  a  control  group  that  partici-
pates  in  the  agency’s  usual  SBIR  process,  without  this  Phase  II–B.  The  evaluation
would then track commercialization outcomes for the two groups over time, to deter-
mine  whether  the  Phase  II–B  incentive  made  a  difference  in  such  outcomes.  At
agencies  such  as  DOD  that  already  track  commercialization  outcome  data  for  most
of  their  SBIR  awardees,  this  rigorous  study  could  be  conducted  at  a  low  cost  by
using  such  data—perhaps  $250,000  per  year  over  five  years  as  a  rough  estimate.
In addition to tracking commercialization outcomes, the evaluation could also sur-
vey  the  agency  scientists  or  engineers  who  monitored  the  SBIR  projects  to  assess
whether the projects in the treatment group made a greater or smaller contribution
to the agency’s research goals than the projects in the control group.

To conduct such a study, I would suggest that the agency engage an independent
evaluation firm with a demonstrated track record in conducting high-quality evalua-
tions using random assignment.
Q6. Looking  at  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA),  how  well  has  SBA  done  to
date in providing management and oversight of the SBIR and STTR Programs?
What do you recommend to improve management and oversight?

A6. SBA  has  played  a  very  useful  role  in  making  sure  that  the  agencies  follow  the
clear, streamlined SBIR procedures set out in the SBA policy directive, and that the
program  is  administered  in  a  fairly  consistent  way  across  the  agencies.  This  is  an
important  role,  because  it  ensures  that  firms  which  are  new  to  the  government
granting and procurement process can compete on the basis of merit with firms that
have more experience with the government process. Put another way, SBA is an ef-
fective counter-weight to the pressures that often exist in the agencies to complicate
the  SBIR  application  and  review  process.  I  would  suggest  that  the  reauthorization
legislation and/or report language focus SBIR on this key role and not, as some have
suggested,  on  other  aspects  of  program  administration  where  SBA  has  less  institu-
tional expertise (e.g., collecting commercialization outcome data).
Q7. You  have  significant  experience  with  the  STTR  program  in  addition  to  SBIR.
What  separate  recommendations  would  you  make  for  the  STTR  program  to  im-
prove program efficiency and effectiveness?

A7. The  STTR  program  serves  as  an  important  complement  to  the  SBIR  program
by  harnessing  a  new  and  different  source  of  innovative  ideas—ideas  that  originate
with a scientist or engineer in a university or federal laboratory. These researchers
cannot participate in the SBIR program in a central way—e.g., as principal investi-
gator—as long as they remain primarily employed at their research institution.

Because  STTR  projects  include  significant  involvement  of  research  institutions—
which  sometimes  don’t  have  a  strong  interest  in  technology  commercialization—I’d
suggest  it  is  particularly  important  for  the  program  to  ensure  that  the  small  busi-
nesses  partnering  with  the  research  institutions  have  strong  commercialization  ca-
pabilities.  Thus,  incentives  such  as  those  I  outline  under  Questions  1  and  3,  and
in my testimony, may be especially important to include in the statutory authoriza-
tion of STTR.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Robert N. Schmidt, Founder and President, Cleveland Medical Devices,

Inc., and Orbital Research, Inc.

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. You have proposed increasing the set-aside for the SBIR program to five percent
over  time.  The  current  Administration’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative
would  double  funding  in  the  physical  sciences  for  NSF,  DOE  and  NIST.  Simi-
larly, NIH funding doubled between FY99–FY03. What is the basis for your rec-
ommendation?  How  much  funding  would  the  SBIR  program  be  if  your  rec-
ommendation  is  implemented  and  Congress  also  funded  the  President’s  budget
proposals for NSF, DOE, and NIST?

A1. SBTC recommends that the SBIR allocation be gradually increased to five per-
cent  for  two  major  reasons.  First,  there  are  new  needs  within  the  Program.  These
include  the  need  to  increase  award  sizes,  which  have  not  been  adjusted  in  fifteen
years,  the  need  to  strengthen  SBIR  Phase  III,  and  the  need  to  provide  the  partici-
pating agencies with additional administrative funds.

Second,  we  believe  that  Congress  should  acknowledge  the  proven  capabilities  of
the  SBIR  Program—as  well  as  a  growing  gap  between  where  American  scientists
and engineers actually are and where federal R&D dollars are going. For almost ten
years, SBIR companies have been obtaining more patents than all U.S. universities
combined. Today it’s about 30 percent more. Meanwhile, smaller companies are em-
ploying  an  increasing  share  of  the  Nation’s  scientists  and  engineers.  Today,  about
a third of all U.S. scientists and engineers—and more than half of those in the pri-
vate sector—work for smaller companies. Yet the percentage of federal R&D dollars
awarded  to  smaller  companies,  including  SBIR  companies,  is  an  astonishingly  low
4.3  percent.  And  SBIR  is  the  only  Program  that  Congress  has  ever  devised  which
actually succeeds in empowering small technology-based companies to obtain federal
R&D contracts.

Gradually increasing the SBIR allocation would not only build on the proven suc-
cess of the SBIR Program. It would also tap into a huge pool of underutilized R&D
talent.  And  it  would  increase  the  share  of  federal  R&D  dollars  awarded  to  small
companies from today’s 4.3 percent to perhaps six or 6.3 percent.

As  we  suggested  in  our  testimony,  SBTC  favors  the  Administration’s  American
Competitiveness  Initiative.  We  think  it  is  needed,  and  we  hope  Congress  approves
it.

Having said that, we would note certain limitations to the ACI. The FY 07 appro-
priations  for  the  agencies  covered  by  ACI  was  $10.6  billion.  The  FY  08  request  for
the same agencies is $11.5 billion, an increase of less than $1 billion (and less than
eight  percent),  if  approved  by  Congress.  The  FY09  request,  whatever  it  may  be,  is
the last budget that the current Administration will be able to monitor and promote
through  the  Congressional  appropriations  process.  These  requests,  then,  represent
only  modest  increments  compared  to  the  ‘‘doubling’’  of  the  R&D  budgets  of  these
agencies by 2016 that the ACI envisions.

Such  an  outcome  is  highly  speculative  at  a  time  of  large  budget  deficits  and

changing political leadership, but, again, we hope it occurs.

Yet even if the FY08 and presumably higher FY09 requests are approved, the in-
creases  that  NSF,  DOE  and  NIST  would  receive  will  affect  only  a  small  fraction  of
the government-wide SBIR Program.

For  FY05,  the  most  recent  year  for  which  SBIR  data  is  relatively  complete,  the

agency SBIR budgets were as follows:

• DOD $1.2 billion
• NIH $525 million
• DOE $104 million
• NSF $61 million
• NIST $3.1 million

The  DOD  SBIR  Program  accounts  for  more  than  half  of  the  government-wide
SBIR  Program  funds.  The  Administration  request  for  DOD  science  and  technology
funds in FY08 is $10.8 billion, down nearly 20 percent from the FY07 appropriation
of $13.3 billion, and more than offsetting the request for increased R&D funding for
the ACI agencies.

Looking  at  the  broader  DOD  RTD&DE  budget  outlays,  these  are  reduced  from

$75.5 billion in 2007 to $72.9 billion in 2008 in the Administration’s budget.

NIH accounts for about another one-third of all SBIR funds, and that funding ap-
pears  to  be  flat  or  increasing  more  slowly  than  inflation  for  the  foreseeable  future.
This year’s NIH request, for example, is 1.1 percent below last year’s actual.

Such  decreases  will  likely  exceed  by  a  wide  margin  any  R&D  funding  increases
in  the  much  smaller  NSF,  DOE,  and  NIST  R&D  budgets,  and  therefore  the  SBIR
Programs that are based on them.

Comparing  the  actual  number  of  SBIR  awards  made  in  FY05  (the  last  year  for

which such data is relatively complete):

• DOD made 3082 awards,
• NIH made 1160,
• DOE made 427,
• NSF made 252 and
• NIST made just 23.

Clearly,  with  DOD  declining  and  NIH  flat,  the  other  three  agencies  would  have

to make up an enormous amount of ground to grow the entire SBIR Program.

Will  they?  Looking  beyond  the  current  Administration’s  FY08  budget  submission
next  January,  (and  the  budget  that  it  submits  during  its  waning  hours  in  January
2009), there is no solid indication of where federal R&D funding is actually headed.
A new Administration and a new Congress in January 2009 will certainly have their
own  set  of  priorities,  not  only  for  R&D  in  general,  but  also  for  the  types  of  R&D
to be funded.

SBTC’s recommendation for a gradual, phased increase in the proportion of R&D

dollars allocated to the SBIR Program is based on three major factors.

of a reality.

• First, award sizes need to be increased to account for inflation and other cost
factors  since  the  award  sizes  were  last  set  in  1992.  A  permanent  inflation-
adjustment  mechanism  needs  to  be  set  in  place.  But  doing  this  will  shrink
the  overall  reach  of  the  Program—its  numbers  of  awards,  its  technologies
accessed, and its awardees—unless the Program itself grows.
• Second, agencies need to be incentivized to make SBIR Phase III much more
• And  third,  some  new  funds  need  to  be  allocated  to  the  administrative  and
management  expenses  associated  with  agency  participation  in  the  Program.
Along  with  that  is  the  simple  fact  that  SBIR  works.  With  more  of  the  Nation’s
science  and  engineering  talent  migrating  into  smaller  companies,  and  with  SBIR
having  a  demonstrated  record  as  the  only  successful  method  yet  devised  for  pro-
viding  these  smaller  companies  with  access  to  federal  R&D  contracts,  it  is  hard  to
see  how  the  Federal  Government  can  continue  meeting  its  R&D  needs  at  a  reason-
able cost without a strengthened SBIR program.
Q2. If the set-aside is doubled, will this be at the expense of university research, cut-

ting their research budgets? Please explain.

A2. If  overall  federal  R&D  funding  increases  under  the  ACI,  as  anticipated  in  the
above  question,  then  the  dollars  actually  going  to  universities  may  well  increase,
even with a slightly larger SBIR Program allocation.

But the larger point is this: SBTC does not at all view university R&D and SBIR
R&D  as  mutually  exclusive.  Rather,  we  see  the  two  as  mutually  reinforcing.  As  we
noted in our testimony, many, if not most, SBIR companies utilize university exper-
tise. I myself have partnered with 14 universities in my SBIR work.

A recent study by the New England Innovation Alliance (NEIA) examined the uni-
versity ties of 17 SBIR companies responding to a poll. These companies had a com-
bined  total  of  175  subcontracts  to  101  different  universities,  for  an  average  of  10.3
subcontracts to universities per company. An average of about six universities were
funded by each company.

Thus  my  companies  CleveMed  and  Orbital  Research,  which  have  contracted  with
14  universities  (or  an  average  of  seven  per  company)  fall  close  to  the  norm  of  the
NEIA study.

The  NEIA  study  also  found  that  the  companies  it  examined  provided  a  total  of
$28,124,005 subcontracting dollars to universities. These university subcontracts in-
volved 243 faculty members and grad students.

As my own experience and the data from the study show, the SBIR Program helps
universities  attract  and  retain  talented  science  and  technology  faculty  by  linking
those  faculty  members  to  remunerative  outside  commercial  projects.  Faculty  mem-
bers contracting individually with the companies in the NEIA study received an ad-
ditional $3,108,700 directly in funding.

85

Moreover, within just these 17 SBIR companies that NEIA polled:

• nine firm founders were university faculty members
• 49 firm executives held academic positions
• 45 firm employees or consultants held faculty positions
• 33  firm  employees  came  from  science  and  technology  graduate  school  pro-
• 25 firm employees were currently adjunct professors at universities

grams, and

Not  only  do  these  SBIR  firms  offer  R&D  employment  and  contracting  opportuni-
ties to universities and faculty members, they also provide a significant spur for re-
searchers  to  focus  their  efforts  on  innovations  that  will  aid  the  universities  finan-
cially  and  have  a  positive  economic  impact  on  the  locality,  the  region  and  even  the
Nation, particularly by creating new jobs, a key goal of the SBIR Program.

In  general,  SBIR  projects  can  help  universities  commercialize  research  by  identi-
fying  ongoing  R&D  with  potential  downstream  commercial  applications,  leading  to
new revenue streams to the universities through sales and licensing.

For their part, universities are increasingly active in creating spin-off companies,
especially  in  economically  distressed  areas.  For  example,  in  Cleveland,  The  Cleve-
land Clinic is looked upon as an engine of economic growth, and the SBIR program
is  an  integral  part  of  the  Clinic’s  strategy.  If  a  slightly  larger  SBIR  Program  were
to  translate  into  a  small  incremental  decrease  of  a  few  percentage  points  in  basic
research dollars available to research institutions like The Cleveland Clinic, that de-
crease could be more than offset by gains to the research institutions from royalties,
sponsored  research,  and  capital  appreciation  from  equity  they  hold  in  these  spin-
offs—many  of  them  SBIR  Program  awardees—not  to  mention  the  value  to  the  Na-
tion of the new jobs and products created by these companies. In the long run, such
a  strategy  would  help  research  institutions  enhance  their  own  assets  and  endow-
ments, and become less dependent on the Federal Government for research funding.
And  just  as  SBIR  companies  depend  on  the  flow  of  new  science  and  engineering
graduates  from  the  universities,  so  also  the  universities  need  to  demonstrate  the
availability  of  attractive  yet  realistic  job  opportunities  to  appeal  to  students  in  the
first  place.  For  many  prospective  science  and  engineering  students,  the  challenges
and  the  relative  freedom,  as  well  as  the  upside  income  potential,  of  working  in  a
leading-edge small company, will be exactly what they are looking for. SBIR compa-
nies offer students not only vivid examples of future employment, but practical and
near-term internship opportunities to experience first-hand the world of innovative,
small  company  R&D.  My  own  company  offers  about  a  dozen  college  internships  a
year, for example.

Because  SBTC  sees  this  university-small  company  relationship  as  so  symbiotic,
we have asked Congress to phase in a tripling of the STTR Program, which directly
links universities and small companies in federally-funded R&D.
Q3. You  recommend  increasing  award  size  but  firmly  limit  the  ability  of  agencies
to exceed SBIR award caps. Would this strict cap have a negative impact on any
agencies  funding  projects  which  contribute  to  their  overall  mission?  Please  ex-
plain your reply and identify what should be the source of funds if review panels
determine additional funds are needed to appropriately fund SIBR projects.

A3. With  respect  to  the  award  size  caps,  SBTC  generally  endorses  the  formula  ap-
proved  by  the  Senate  Small  Business  and  Entrepreneurship  Committee  last  year.
That  formula  would  set  the  caps  at  $150,000  for  Phase  I  and  $1,250,000  for  Phase
II, and would allow for annual inflation adjustments The Senate bill also would per-
mit agencies to exceed these caps by 50 percent in selected instances. Thus, the ini-
tial Phase I ‘‘override’’ would be $225,000; the Phase II, $1,875,000.

Congress does have a ‘‘balancing act’’ to deal with on this issue.
Relatively small caps permit the agencies to explore innovative ideas without cre-

ating major economic fallout if the innovations don’t pan out.

Then,  too,  the  purpose  of  the  SBIR  Program  since  its  inception  has  been  to  har-
vest  as  much  of  the  small  company  R&D  relevant  to  the  Federal  Government’s
needs  as  possible.  Historically,  these  companies  and  their  technologies  have  been
largely  precluded  from  the  federal  R&D  contracting  process.  Keeping  the  award
sizes  small  helps  promote  a  broad  search  for  promising  innovations  and  promising
companies.

These  basic  thrusts  need  to  be  maintained.  Agencies  do,  after  all,  have  other
sources  of  funds  to  expand  the  funding  for  exceptionally  meritorious  individual
projects.

Still,  the  SBIR  Program  also  needs  to  be  flexible.  Perhaps,  instead  of  using  the
50 percent override mechanism favored by the Senate bill, Congress could authorize

participating  agencies  to  allocate  as  much  as  10–15  percent  of  their  overall  SBIR
funds  to  individual  projects  that  hold  unusual  promise  for  helping  an  agency  meet
its mission.

But  we  must  be  realistic  about  how  much  additional  technological  advance  the
agencies  can  achieve  by  shifting  these  limited  SBIR  funds.  For  example,  the  entire
annual  SBIR  budget  at  NIH  would  not  suffice  to  put  a  single  new  drug  through
human  testing.  The  October  2006  Milken  Institute  study  that  we  have  provided  to
the  Subcommittee,  Financial  Innovations  for  Accelerating  Medical  Solutions,  notes
the  scale  of  funding  needed  and  suggests  a  number  of  (non-SBIR)  financing  solu-
tions to meet such biomedical needs.
Q4. In  your  testimony,  you  support  addressing  commercialization  funding  gaps  and
comment favorably on several agency efforts. Based upon the experience of SBTC
member companies, which programs are most promising?

A4. From  what  SBTC  has  observed  and  learned  from  federal  agencies  and  SBIR
companies,  the  most  promising  commercialization  activities  currently  underway  in
the  SBIR  Program  are  the  ‘‘II–B’’  awards  in  the  Navy  submarine  program,  NSF’s
‘‘Phase II–B,’’ and NIH’s ‘‘Phase II continuation’’ awards. While the details of these
programs  differ  to  suit  different  agency  needs,  all  appear  to  be  working.  The  Com-
mercialization  Pilot  Program  (CPP),  approved  by  Congress  last  year,  is  showing
great promise at DOD, but initial results are a year or so away.

The  term  ‘‘commercialization’’  is  a  relative  one,  however.  For  agencies  like  DOD,
and  to  a  significant  extent  NASA  and  DOE,  commercialization  entails  insertion  of
the technology into larger systems that the agency itself is acquiring. Such agencies
need  to  be  incentivized  to  do  exactly  this,  since  they  are,  in  effect,  the  customers
for the technology.

For agencies that expect the private sector to develop and acquire the technology,
such  as  NIH  and  NSF,  commercialization  entails  incentives  to  bring  partners  into
the  development  and  marketing  phases  of  the  technology.  As  NSF  and  NIH  have
shown, there is more than one way to do this successfully. SBTC believes the SBIR
reauthorization  should  state  what  Congress  expects  from  the  agencies  regarding
commercialization, but should give them the flexibility to address that goal in their
own ways.

It  should  be  noted  that  when  SBIR  was  created  in  1982,  Congress  foresaw  the
need  to  include  customer  acceptance  testing  in  the  SBIR  program.  Section  9  (e)  (4)
of the statute defines ‘‘research and development’’ to include ‘‘(B) a systematic study
directed  specifically  toward  applying  new  knowledge  to  meet  a  recognized  need;
or  (C)  a  systematic  application  of  knowledge  toward  the  production  of  useful  mate-
rials, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development and improve-
ment of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements.’’
Q5. You recommend Congress provide incentives to agencies to match the success in
SBIR Phase I and II in SBIR Phase III. What incentives specifically do you rec-
ommend? What should be included in the expenditures you recommend for test-
ing and evaluation? How should this be funded?

A5. To  advance  Phase  III  of  the  SBIR  Program,  SBTC  recommends  that  Congress
devote  about  one-third  of  the  phased  increase  in  SBIR  (that  we  have  requested)  to
Phase  III  incentives.  These  incentives  should  include  funds  for  testing  and  evalua-
tion,  as  well  as  the  movement  of  SBIR  technologies  into  the  acquisition  processes
of agencies like DOD, NASA and DOE, (as discussed above in answer 4).

In  the  case  of  DOD,  most  Phase  II  SBIR  technologies  exit  the  SBIR  Program  at
‘‘Technology  Readiness  Level  4’’  (TRL  4).  This  technology  will  need  to  be  advanced
to  about  Technology  Readiness  Level  8  (TRL  8)  in  order  to  be  inserted  into  main-
stream DOD acquisition programs.

Agencies like DOD—that have an unfortunate history of paying large contractors
to reinvent SBIR technologies—should be incentivized to purchase the original SBIR
technologies instead.

As  an  example,  one  approach  at  DOD  might  be  to  offer  an  award  fee  to  prime
contractors  on  programs  over  $100,000,000  that  insert  the  SBIR  technology  into
major  systems  or  that  provide  subcontracts  to  SBIR  companies  equal  to  or  greater
than  a  set  percentage  of  the  prime  contract.  For  NASA,  DOE  and  DOT,  a  similar
award  fee  could  be  provided  for  prime  contractors  on  programs  over  $10,000,000  if
they meet similar conditions.

Agencies  that  don’t  purchase  technologies,  or  that  don’t  purchase  many  tech-
nologies,  should  be  incentivized  to  identify  successful  commercialization  paths  and
strengthen them. But to reiterate the earlier point, SBTC urges Congress to set the
goals  in  this  area  while  leaving  it  up  to  the  agencies  to  invent  the  best  approaches
to meeting the goals.

Q6. You  recommend  re-allocating  one  percent  of  SBIR  total  dollars  to  new  agency
administrative  costs?  What  administrative  costs  should  be  included?  What  do
you estimate to be the cost for each of these activities?

A6. SBTC  recommends  that  Congress  allot  one  percent  of  total  new  SBIR  dollars
to  new  administrative  costs.  We  believe  the  agencies  should  have  some  flexibility
in  allocating  these  funds.  Salaries  and  expenses  of  new  personnel  devoted  exclu-
sively  to  the  SBIR  Program  will  absorb  some  of  the  dollars;  new  conferences  and
manuals might absorb others. COTR’s could be given funding for site visits and co-
ordination. The agencies should be required to report to Congress regularly on how
they are using the new dollars. For its part, Congress should monitor these reports
carefully, to be sure that the new funds are not being used to displace existing SBIR
administrative  and  management  funds,  and  are  not  being  diluted  by  allocations  to
personnel and programs that have other tasks besides SBIR.

To  the  largest  extent  practical,  training  and  mentoring  funds  should  be  made
available  directly  to  the  SBIR  companies.  Within  certain  guidelines,  these  compa-
nies  should  decide  on  their  own  best  use  of  the  funds.  The  same  is  true  of  the  con-
tent  of  the  training.  Agencies  cannot  always  know  what  a  company’s  competencies
and needs are. Companies should be able to choose training options.
Q7. You  noted  in  your  testimony  the  importance  of  effective  management  and  over-
sight  of  SBIR/STTR  programs.  How  well  has  SBA  done  to  date  in  providing
management and oversight? What needs to be done to strengthen the SBA Office
of Technology?

A7. With respect to SBA, SBTC would note that while the SBIR Program has quad-
rupled  over  the  past  twenty  years,  SBA’s  staffing  resources  for  administering  it
have declined by 50 percent. This has led to problems like slower turnaround times
on agency waiver decisions, slower posting of SBIR award information and statistics
on  the  SBA  website,  and  less  oversight  and  coordination  with  the  agencies.  With
more  personnel,  SBA’s  Office  of  Technology  could  provide  more  timely  and  helpful
guidance  for  participating  agencies  in  the  SBIR  Program,  as  well  as  more  targeted
oversight data for Congress. It will also allow the SBA to coordinate ‘‘best practices’’
sharing  and  training  among  the  agencies.  Congress  also  should  consider  elevating
the Office of Technology within SBA to signal the importance of its mission.
Q8. In your written testimony, you identify an issue with intellectual property rights
of SBIR companies. Would you please explain the issue and the remedy you rec-
ommend?

A8. The  intellectual  property  rights  case  that  SBTC  referenced  in  its  testimony  is
Night  Vision  v.  U.S.,  relating  to  the  use  of  an  SBIR  company’s  proprietary  tech-
nology by the Air Force. The plaintiffs allege that the Air Force ‘‘reverse engineered’’
their  technology  and  then  gave  the  resulting  intellectual  property  to  another  con-
tractor  to  further  advance  the  technology.  Whatever  the  merits  of  the  allegation,  it
would appear that the Court misinterpreted Congressional intent with respect to IP
rights  in  the  SBIR  Program  (and  predecessor  legislation  like  the  Bayh-Dole  Act),
thereby setting an unfortunate precedent. For a strong SBIR program and a strong
American  technology-based  economy,  it  is  imperative  that  the  IP  rights  of  SBIR
technology remain with the small business, and not be usurped by the government.
This  will  allow  the  SBIR  companies  to  grow  the  technologies  that  they  created.
SBTC intends to work with Congress to clarify these points for the courts going for-
ward.
Q9. You  state  in  your  written  testimony  that  250  SBTC  firms  have  won  SBIR
awards. Which agencies are the primary sources of award funds to SBTC firms?
What  percentage  received  awards  from  DOD  and  NIH?  What  percentage  of  the
250 SBTC companies has commercialized products?

A9. SBTC’s  members  who  have  obtained  SBIR  contract  awards  are  distributed
across  federal  agency  SBIR  Programs  in  roughly  the  same  proportions  as  the  rel-
ative  sizes  of  Programs.  For  example,  DOD,  which  accounts  for  a  bit  over  half  of
the  SBIR  Program  dollars,  also  accounts  for  about  half  of  SBTC’s  SBIR  awardee
members.  NIH,  which  represents  about  a  third  of  the  SBIR  Program,  also  rep-
resents about a third of SBTC’s SBIR members. And so on. As to commercialization,
the last time we sampled SBTC members on this question, the results were distrib-
uted  in  a  ‘‘bell  shaped  curve,’’  with  most  SBIR  awardees  having  commercialization
scores of around 50 percent.

Questions submitted by Representative Judy Biggert
Q1. Your  written  testimony  states  that,  ‘‘Thanks  to  their  deep-pocket  backing,  the
companies that the VCs fund will be able to submit multiple proposals per solici-
tation.’’ Given your concern about the number of proposals submitted and poten-
tially  the  number  of  SBIR  awards  granted  to  a  particular  company,  do  you
think it would be reasonable to limit the number of grants any one company can
receive in a year or over 10 years across all agencies?

A1. The  question  as  formulated  equates  two  very  different  issues.  The  first  issue
is  how  Congress  should  respond  to  the  prospect  of  large  companies  devising  strate-
gies  to  siphon  off  funds  that  are  legally  restricted  to  small  business.  The  second
issue  is  what  steps,  if  any,  Congress  or  an  agency  might  take  to  limit  the  number
of SBIR contracts awarded to individual small companies.

The essence of the first issue is preventing potentially illegal activity and uphold-
ing  the  integrity  of  a  program  that  Congress  and  the  American  people  expect  to  be
dedicated to small business.

The  essence  of  the  second  issue  is  selecting  the  most  effective  policies  within  a

small business program.

As far as having large companies illegally undermine this or any other small busi-
ness program, SBTC is opposed to it. As far as the policy choice of whether to limit
the number of SBIR contract awards that an individual company may obtain, SBTC
understands  both  sides  of  the  issue,  but  believes,  on  balance,  this  would  not  be  de-
sirable—just  as  it  would  not  be  desirable  to  limit  the  number  of  R&D  awards  to
major universities or large businesses.

SBIR is a highly competitive program. Usually, there are between four and thirty
proposals for every award. The proportion of applicant companies obtaining contract
awards  varies  between  agencies,  from  about  one  in  five  applicants  to  about  one  in
12.

By contrast, this intensity of competition is hardly ever seen in larger federal con-
tracts. Except in rare circumstances, neither the agencies nor Congress question the
awarding  of  multiple,  non-competitive  R&D  contracts  to  large  companies  and  major
universities.

Thus,  SBIR  companies  must  struggle  much  harder  against  competitors  to  prove
the value of an innovation than do most of their larger counterparts, such as major
‘‘defense contractors’’ (whose very name suggests their focus on repetitive DOD con-
tracts) or major universities seeking large research grants from NIH.

SBTC  supports  the  overall  SBIR  goal  of  securing  the  widest  possible  array  of
needed R&D from small business. But we also believe that it makes little sense for
federal  agencies  to  bypass  the  best  technologies  to  emerge  from  these  crucibles  of
SBIR competition—and select the second or third best solutions to the government’s
needs—simply  to  prevent  a  small  business  from  obtaining  one  too  many  SBIR  con-
tracts.

Given  the  SBIR  Program’s  increasing  emphasis  on  commercialization,  SBIR
awardees also represent a significant public benefit. This benefit takes on added im-
portance  in  an  environment  of  global  competitive  challenges,  many  of  them  techno-
logical,  faced  by  the  United  States.  It  would  be  most  unfortunate  to  undermine
these benefits of the SBIR Program.

It  is  the  companies  who  have  won  a  number  of  SBIR  contracts—most  of  whom
have  relatively  high  commercialization  scores—that  are  more  likely  to  be  commer-
cializing the technology—domestically and globally.

Two examples from my companies: Cleveland Medical Devices is beginning to pen-
etrate Asian markets. We are now receiving orders from Malaysia, Singapore, India,
and the Philippines for our sleep apnea diagnostic devices.

Orbital  Research  is  developing  a  third  generation  of  flight  control,  which  we  call
Aerionics.  We  recently  received  third  party  confirmation  of  interest  from  South
Korea, where the technology would be used on a missile defense system. The South
Koreans  say  that  they  believe  Orbital  Research  is  the  ‘‘leading  company  in  the
world’’ in this new technology.

Why  would  we  cut  off  promising  research  like  this  to  hold  small  companies  to  a
set number of awards? We don’t do that with defense contractors or leading univer-
sities.  Why  would  we  declare  the  most  promising  new  companies  as  personas  non-
grata, just when they are starting to deliver on the whole long-term promise of the
SBIR Program? That would surely tempt some such companies—that U.S. taxpayers
have  invested  in—to  relocate  in  countries  like  Singapore  that  invest  much  more
heavily in new technology than the U.S. does, on a per capita basis.
Q2. Your  companies  have  successfully  participated  in  the  SBIR  program.  Prior  to
2003,  did  you  encounter  problems  participating  in  the  SBIR  program?  What  is

89

the number of SBIR awards that companies that you lead received prior to 2003
and have received since 2003?

A2. As  my  companies  became  more  technologically  mature  and  more  acquainted
with  the  SBIR  Program,  their  performance  improved.  This  has  nothing  to  do  with
date  of  2003  or  any  other  particular  year.  It  has  everything  to  do  with  the  compa-
nies’ internal trajectories of technological and business development. But to answer
the  question,  prior  to  the  date  of  2003,  Cleveland  Medical  Devices  won  36  Phase
I  and  21  Phase  II  awards,  an  average  of  about  five  per  year.  Orbital  Research  won
31  Phase  I  and  14  Phase  II  awards,  also  an  average  of  about  five  per  year.  From
2003 to the present, CleveMed won 22 Phase I awards and 17 Phase II awards, an
average  of  about  eight  a  year,  and  Orbital  won  23  Phase  I  awards  and  10  Phase
II  awards,  an  average  of  about  six  per  year.  There  has  never  been  a  ‘‘spike’’  in  the
number of our awards. They increased incrementally. So, too, did the college interns
that we trained, the work with our university partners, (now numbering 14), as well
as  the  jobs  and  inward  investment  that  we  provided  in  inner  city  Cleveland—to-
gether with the awards that the companies won from Harvard University, Inc maga-
zine, and others for these accomplishments.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Gerard  J.  McGarrity,  Executive  Vice  President  of  Scientific  and  Clin-

ical Affairs, VIRxSYS Corporation

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. What  changes  to  the  SBIR  program  do  you  recommend  to  increase  the  number
of  small  businesses  applying  for  awards  in  the  life  sciences?  In  your  response,
please  estimate  the  typical  dollar  cost  to  a  firm  to  prepare  an  application  in
Phase  I  and  Phase  II,  and  the  size  of  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  awards  that  would
attract more SBIR applicants in the life sciences. What types of flexibility in the
application process are important to applicants?

A1. The primary reason small biotechnology companies are not taking advantage of
the  SBIR  program  is  that  many  of  the  companies  are  ineligible  for  the  program
based upon their capital structure. As a result of a 2003 Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ) ruling companies with majority-venture capital backing are ineligible to com-
pete  for  SBIR  grants.  Small  biotechnology  companies  do  not  have  product  revenue,
so  companies  have  to  raise  funds  through  venture  capital  in  exchange  for  equity  in
the  company.  As  a  result  of  these  capital  needs,  a  significant  portion  of  bio-
technology companies are ineligible to compete under the 2003 ALJ ruling, and sub-
sequent  change  in  SBA  policy.  Biotechnology  companies  will  apply  for  these  grants
if  Congress  clarifies  that  those  domestic  companies  with  fewer  than  500  employees
can  compete  for  these  grants.  A  recent  survey  of  144  small  emerging  biotechnology
companies’ CEOs and CFOs found that 84 percent of companies would apply for an
SBIR grant if they were eligible despite their capital structure.1

While  the  cost  of  the  application  will  likely  vary  depending  on  the  companies  ex-
perience  with  writing  grant  applications,  in  my  experience  with  the  SBIR  program
it  takes  approximately  two  months  of  staff  time  for  two  senior  staff  to  apply  for  a
Phase  I  SBIR  grant,  costing  in  the  range  of  $20,000–$30,000.  To  apply  for  a  Phase
II  SBIR  grant  usually  requires  3–4  staff  and  four  months  time,  costing  approxi-
mately  $80,000-100,000.  These  estimates  are  based  on  experience  with  one  com-
pany.

The broad scope of the SBIR program requires that maximum flexibility is main-
tained  so  that  grants  can  serve  a  variety  of  agency  missions.  Likewise,  differences
in product development timelines require agency flexibility so that SBIR grants are
meaningful  across  industries.  For  example,  in  the  biotechnology  industry  it  takes
eight  to  10  years  or  more  to  bring  a  product  to  market.2 Such  flexibility  should  in-
clude  award  size  and  the  ability  to  directly  obtain  a  Phase  II  grant  where  the
science merits such flexibility.
Q2. Please  explain  your  views  on  how  the  NIH  peer  review  groups  accesses  whether

a project is adequately funded.

A2. The  peer  review  process  is  the  only  appropriate  mechanism  for  making  factual
funding determinations. While it is not a perfect system, and in some circumstances
errors  may  occur,  it  is  a  system  in  which  a  group  of  scientific  experts  evaluate  the
appropriateness of the budget. When I was in academia, I served on an NIH Study
Section for several years. I have also been a grant reviewer for the NIH since I have
been  in  industry.  I  have  always  been  impressed  with  the  enthusiasm  and  the  com-
petence of the reviewers.

It is reasonable to allow or even encourage agencies to establish suggested guide-
lines for determining the budget for an award, but ultimately strict rules and limita-
tions are arbitrary and will minimize the ability to get the most of the SBIR awards.
This may be an appropriate area for the agency or department in question to deter-
mine how often budgets are accepted as submitted and how often they are adjusted
upwards or downwards. Typically, the budget is adjusted downward, because the re-
viewers  do  not  see  the  justification  for  certain  requested  items.  On  the  other  hand,
the first SBIR grant that my former company Intronn received, the reviewers actu-
ally increased the requested budget because they were impressed with the potential
of the technology.
Q3. You  have  described  the  importance  of  venture  capital  in  meeting  the  capital
needs of biotechnology companies because of the high cost and length of product

development.  If  a  venture  capital  firm  has  already  invested  in  an  SBIR  award
recipient,  how  could  the  SBIR  program  be  structured  to  encourage  the  venture
capital company to provide additional investment and commercialization assist-
ance for the SBIR project beyond that offered by the SBIR award itself?

A3. Typically,  biotechnology  companies  will  receive  venture  capital  financing  for  a
lead  product  and  would  like  to  obtain  SBIR  funding  for  early  stage  products  that
may be viewed as too high risk for venture capital investment. SBIR grants provide
an  opportunity  for  companies  to  start  or  restart  research  on  a  product  that  may  be
sitting on the shelf due to lack of funding. SBIR funds will therefore provide an op-
portunity to further along development of this project, through proof of concept and
feasibility.  This  furtherance  of  development  alone  makes  the  research  more  attrac-
tive to venture capitalists. Additionally, there is strong evidence that the SBIR pro-
gram  creates  a  ‘‘halo  effect’’  that  attracts  private  investment  because  the  research
has received a certification of sorts from the granting agency.3 While venture capital
investment  in  biotechnology  companies  remains  strong,  the  majority  of  the  invest-
ment occurs in later stage companies or projects, especially those that are in Phase
II  clinical  trials.  It  is  much  harder  to  attract  investments  in  pre-clinical  projects.
In addition to the inherent benefits of the SBIR program with regard to attracting
additional  investment,  Congress  should  provide  additional  flexibility  to  agencies  to
implement  demonstration  projects  in  Phase  III.  For  example,  an  agency  could  pro-
vide  matching  funds,  up  to  specified  dollar  amount,  in  Phase  III  to  companies  that
receive  private  sector  investment  for  the  SBIR  project  within  a  specified  amount  of
time  upon  completing  Phase  II  grants.  Any  such  demonstration  projects  could  be
shared  with  all  the  agencies  and  departments  participating  in  the  SBIR  program,
so  best  practices  can  be  identified.  However,  given  the  breadth  of  agencies,  depart-
ments,  and  participating  industries  demonstration  may  not  be  appropriate  for  all
facets of the SBIR program.

Finally,  given  that  the  SBIR  program  rightly  invests  in  high-risk  research,  it  is
appropriate  that  some  of  the  funded  research  will  not  produce  the  intended  out-
comes and attract private sector investment. This is similar to the research funding
that the NIH provides to the academic community. It is important to also be mind-
ful  that  the  focus  on  commercialization  should  not  drive  the  granting  agencies  and
departments to award grants to projects that are ‘‘safe.’’ Doing so would undermine
one of the unique contributions that the SBIR program makes to greater knowledge
and the economy.
Q4. SBIR  awards  are  granted  in  support  of  agency  missions—in  the  case  of  NIH,
to  make  medical  discoveries  that  improve  health  and  save  lives.  If  the  market
opportunity for an SBIR project is small, what would encourage venture capital
company  financial  support  and  commercialization  assistance  for  the  SBIR
project over time?

A4. There  are  a  variety  of  factors  that  venture  capitalists  consider  when  deter-
mining whether or not to invest in research, including, but not limited to, the qual-
ity  of  the  science,  stage  of  development,  intellectual  property  protections,  market
size, existence of similar or competing products, quality of management team, qual-
ity  of  scientific  expertise,  and  possible  insurance  coverage  and  reimbursement  pol-
icy.  Likewise,  a  company  with  a  platform  technology  will  conduct  a  similar  assess-
ment in determining which therapeutic areas to focus development of a product. Not
all  these  factors  are  given  equal  weight,  and  strength  in  one  particular  area  may
overcome weaknesses in another area. Venture capital companies review the oppor-
tunity  in  its  totality.  Additionally,  venture  capital  companies’  estimation  of  oppor-
tunity of particular research will not be unanimous.

It is the case that many biotechnology products in development are for non-tradi-
tional  markets,  such  as  for  orphan  diseases  or  for  diseases  predominately  found  in
the  third  world.  The  barriers  to  bringing  orphan  drugs  to  market  have  been  well
recognized  by  Congress  and  are  the  basis  for  the  Orphan  Drug  Act  of  1983.  This
law  aims  to  provide  incentives  through  market  exclusivity  and  tax  credits  for  pri-
vate  sector  investment  in  orphan  products.  In  2001,  the  Department  of  Health  and
Human Services Office of Inspector General studied the impact of the Orphan Drug
Act  and  found  that  it  was  particularly  successful  in  attracting  venture  capital  fi-
nancing  for  orphan  products  being  developed  by  biotechnology  companies.4 A  BIO

survey  found  that  80  percent  of  private  biotechnology  companies  pursuing  an  or-
phan product have also received venture capital.5

Despite the fact that orphan products often successfully attract venture capital fi-
nancing,  it  continues  to  be  an  area  with  additional  challenges.  This  is  also  true  for
biotechnology  products  being  developed  to  treat  illness  predominately  affecting  the
third  world.  Foundations  have  been  particularly  effective  in  supplementing  funding
for  orphan  products  and  third  world  diseases.  For  example,  the  Cystic  Fibrosis
Foundation has invested or committed $290 million to early stage development work
since 1998.6 Similarly, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is supporting research
and development in the private sector for therapies and vaccines for Malaria, Tuber-
culosis, and diarrhea, amongst other diseases.7 These foundations can help fill gaps
that exist in traditional venture capital financing.

As  a  part  of  Phase  III  SBIR  commercialization,  the  NIH  could  facilitate  con-
necting  companies  that  are  pursuing  research  in  orphan  diseases  or  diseases  im-
pacting  the  third  world  with  the  appropriate  foundations  that  are  making  venture
capital investments in these areas.
Q5. What  criteria  do  venture  capital  companies  use  when  making  a  decision  to  in-
vest in a company and a specific project? If a company has venture capital fund-
ing  and  a  company  project  receives  an  SBIR  award,  but  the  project  does  not
meet  venture  capital  criteria  for  investment  upon  completion  of  Phase  II,  how
will  that  project  be  managed?  For  such  an  SBIR  project,  what  are  the  possible
options and issues in spinning out that project to another company?

A5. As previously stated, there a variety of factors that venture capitalists consider
when  determining  whether  or  not  to  invest  in  research,  including,  but  not  limited
to, the quality of the science, stage of development, intellectual property protections,
market  size,  existence  of  similar  or  competing  products,  quality  of  management
team, quality of scientific expertise, and possible insurance coverage and reimburse-
ment  policy.  Not  all  these  factors  are  given  equal  weight,  and  strength  in  one  par-
ticular  area  may  overcome  weaknesses  in  another  area.  Venture  capital  companies
review  the  opportunity  in  its  totality.  Additionally,  venture  capital  companies’  esti-
mation of opportunity of particular research will not be unanimous.

For  example,  the  May  22,  2006  Bioentrepreneur  article,  Trendspotting:  Betting
strong but playing safe, found ‘‘Venture capital investors also appear to be investing
more effort in ensuring that the clinical development program described in a poten-
tial  portfolio  company’s  business  plan  makes  sense  and  is  realistic.  Because  setting
the  wrong  goals  in  the  program  or  getting  the  timing  wrong  by  just  a  little  bit  can
have  disastrous  consequences  in  subsequent  fund-raisings,  VCs  are  engaging  med-
ical  consultants  as  clinical  advisory  panels  to  validate  and  modify  the  programs  as
a  prelude  to  making  their  investments.  The  panels  are  asked  to  determine,  among
other  things,  whether  the  investors  are  funding  to  the  appropriate  endpoints  based
on the correct assumptions.’’

A biotechnology company’s subsequent management of a project that has not been
successful  in  attracting  venture  capital  will  likely  depend  on  the  reason  for  its  fail-
ure to attract investment. If the project is failing to get additional financing because
research  into  the  proposed  biologic  mechanism  failed  to  produce  expected  results,
then  the  project  may  no  longer  be  pursued  or  require  a  reworking  and  return  to
proof of concept stage. Alternatively, if the lack of investment is being driven by con-
cerns  about  the  company’s  management  or  research  team,  then  a  company  has  the
opportunity  to  bring  in  additional  personnel  resources,  consultants,  or  enter  into  a
joint venture to address the concern.

Alternatively,  if  the  reason  that  venture  capital  firms  are  not  interested  in  a
project is due to the small market size, SBIR grants can serve as a critical resource
in  driving  the  project  forward.  As  described  above,  SBIR  awards  can  be  combined
with Foundations and private philanthropy to bring a therapeutic solution to a com-
mercially unattractive disease.

It is in a biotechnology company’s interest to pursue as many potential therapies
as  is  possible  because  it  diversifies  the  risk  in  a  scientific  area  with  a  high  failure
rate.  As  such,  a  biotechnology  company  is  likely  try  to  address  the  concerns  being
raised by venture capital companies if it is possible and reasonable to do so. Outside
of  these  efforts,  other  options  that  exist  include  the  before-described  opportunities

with  foundations  and  possibly  licensing  the  technology  to  a  company  that  has  com-
plementary technology or expertise in this area in order to further the research.
Q6. What definition do you recommend for an eligible venture capital company when
determining eligibility of an SBIR applicant? What would this definition include
what would it exclude?

A6. Allowing small (fewer than 500 employees) domestic companies the opportunity
to  compete  for  SBIR  grants  is  important  to  the  SBIR  program  and  the  industries
or  companies  that  are  currently  excluded  based  upon  their  capital  structure.  Small
domestic  companies  with  private  investment  from  eligible  venture  capital  compa-
nies, foundations, and trusts should be eligible to apply for SBIR grants. Currently,
a  company  with  any  of  above  mix  of  investment  that  exceeds  51  percent  ownership
is precluded.

As  it  relates  to  determining  an  eligible  venture  capital  company,  there  are  exist-
ing  references  in  current  law,  listed  below,  that  should  encompass  US  venture  cap-
ital  companies.  Additionally,  BIO  supports  excluding  venture  capital  companies  es-
tablished  by  large  corporations  from  the  definition  of  an  eligible  venture  capital
company for the purposes of SBIR.
(1) Venture Capitol Operating Companies

These are VCs defined in a Labor Dept. regulation, 29 CFR 2510.3–101(d), whose
managers  have  some  ‘‘management  rights’’  with  respect  to  the  portfolio  companies
in  which  they  invest,  and  exercise  such  rights  in  at  least  one  such  portfolio  com-
pany. Such management rights are not inconsistent with minority VCOC ownership
positions.  For  example,  having  a  single  Board  seat  constitutes  a  ‘‘management
right,’’ even though it affords no VC control over management and operations of the
small business.
(2) VC firms registered under the 1940 Investment Company Act

Most  VCs  with  greater  than  100  employees  are  required  to  register  with  Securi-

ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the 1940 Investment Company Act.
(3)  VC  firms  not  required  to  register  with  SEC,  because  they  fall  within  a  1940  Act
exception for firms with <100 investors

This covers most smaller VCs—including most VCs that invest in small, emerging

companies—who tend to have fewer than 100 employees.
Q7. In your written testimony you cite 252 FDA approved biologics developed by BIO
companies,  and  32  percent  of  the  companies  and  affiliates  received  an  SBIR/
STTR  award.  What  percentage  of  the  companies  and  affiliates  that  received
SBIR/STTR awards also received venture capital backing?

A7. 162 companies were involved in the development of the 252 FDA approved bio-
logics.  Of  those,  52  were  past  SBIR  or  STTR  award  recipients.  Of  those  52  compa-
nies  39  or  75  percent  definitively  received  venture  capture  capital  financing  prior
to becoming a public company. For the other 13 companies BIO was unable to deter-
mine  if  they  received  venture  capital  financing,  either  because  the  company  has
merged  or  changed  ownership  a  number  of  times,  or  because  existing  databases  on
private  companies  were  not  in  existence  prior  to  the  company  going  public.  How-
ever,  it  would  be  unusual  that  a  biotechnology  company  would  secure  sufficient  in-
vestment from individuals alone prior to becoming public.

Questions submitted by Representative Judy Biggert
Q1. Can  you  illustrate  for  me  why  a  health  sciences  company  with  venture  capital
financing,  even  significant  financing,  would  desire  to  participate  in  the  SBIR
program,  where  the  award  sizes  are  significantly  smaller  than  a  round  of  ven-
ture financing?

A1. A  biotechnology  company  is  a  collection  of  research  projects.  A  recent  BIO  sur-
vey found that on average an emerging biotechnology company has five products in
development.  The  typical  biotechnology  company’s  lead  product  will  be  in  Phase  II
clinical trials, with one product in Phase I clinical trials, and three products in pre-
clinical development. A biotechnology company will most likely be able to raise ven-
ture  capital  for  their  lead  product  and  maybe  the  product  in  Phase  I  clinical  trials
as well.

These  venture  capital  funds  are  generally  not  interchangeable;  but  instead  funds
are tied to specific development milestones for a specific product. Most often compa-
nies  are  unable  to  use  venture  capital  funds  for  a  lead  product  to  conduct  pre-clin-

ical  research  and  development.  However,  SBIR  grants  provide  an  ideal  opportunity
to  further  very-early  stage  development  without  diluting  a  company’s  equity.
Through  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  awards  the  research  project  can  be  furthered  to  the
point where it is considered attractive to venture capital investment.
Q2. What role have SBIR grants historically played in your industry?
A2. For  the  first  twenty  years  of  the  SBIR  program  biotechnology  companies  were
able  to  compete  for  SBIR  grants.  In  biotechnology,  the  SBIR  program  has  played
a  role  in  advancing  the  science  and  research  of  companies  that  have  ultimately
brought  a  product  to  market.  For  example,  there  are  163  companies  and  affiliates
involved in the development of the 252 FDA approved biologics, 32 percent of those
companies and affiliates have received at least one SBIR/STTR award. Additionally,
the Small Business Technology Council’s written testimony before the Subcommittee
highlighted 13 outstanding SBIR graduates of which were four biotechnology compa-
nies (Amgen, Biogen, Genzyme, and Chiron).

This  record  clearly  shows  that  the  original  SBIR  system  was  working.  Bio-
technology companies with highly innovative technologies and program were able to
compete  for  limited  funds  and  bring  many  of  these  breakthrough  products  to  suc-
cessful treatments of patients who had no alternatives.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu
Q1. What  changes  to  the  SBIR  program  do  you  recommend  to  increase  the  number
of  small  businesses  applying  for  awards  in  the  life  sciences?  In  your  response,
please  estimate  the  typical  dollar  cost  to  a  firm  to  prepare  an  application  in
Phase  I  and  Phase  II,  and  the  size  of  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  awards  that  would
attract more SBIR applicants in the life sciences. What types of flexibility in the
application process are important to applicants?

A1. One  of  the  key  elements  in  applying  for  awards  in  the  SBIR  program  is  the
timing  from  initiation  of  a  proposal  to  award  then  the  timing  from  completion  of
the Phase I to Phase II. Upon recognition of a grant opportunity for a Phase I SBIR,
the  time  required  to  formulate  the  hypothesis  and  consider  alternatives,  perform
background and literature searches, develop the project plan, determine the budget,
and  develop  an  initial  commercialization  strategy  takes  (as  suggested  by  NIH)  at
least  three  months  to  prepare  properly.  The  effort  during  this  time  varies  but  can
easily  exceed  a  cumulative  80  man-hours  of  preparation,  writing,  and  internal  re-
view  prior  to  submission  of  the  grant.  If  an  academic  or  clinical  institution  is  in-
volved,  then  there  are  also  significant  contractual  issues  to  be  addressed  up  front
that can add time and legal expense. Further, if regulatory submissions (either ani-
mal  or  human)  are  needed,  then  there  is  significant  effort  in  obtaining  the  appro-
priate  approvals  prior  to  submission.  When  using  an  external  agency  to  assist  in
compiling  the  grant,  the  preparation  time  is  not  significantly  reduced  as  there  is
much  interaction  in  translating  the  requirements,  tasks  and  reviewing  the  output.
Between  the  internal  staff  time  and  consultants  (for  grant  writing,  regulatory  sub-
missions, and legal contracts) the estimated costs for a Phase I grant surely can ex-
ceed $15,000. In a Phase I grant this is money that has a low percentage yield and
is  only  potentially  realized  in  6–9  months  after  the  grant  is  submitted.  Alternative
approaches may be to have an initial (faster) Phase I review that could provide feed-
back on the acceptability of the proposal prior to committing to regulatory and con-
tractual  arrangements.  Another  approach  may  be  to  combine  Phase  I  &  II  approv-
als, such that when Phase I milestones are reached the grant continuation to Phase
II is automatic. This would avoid funding gaps between grant phases and mean that
the initial capital risk of developing the proposal has a larger payoff.
Q2. Please  explain  your  views  on  how  the  NIH  peer  review  groups  assess  whether

a project is adequately funded?

A2. The  only  feedback  we  have  on  our  prepared  grant  budgets  to  date  has  been
‘‘seems  appropriate.’’  As  we  have  been  working  with  the  NIH  on  our  budgets  we
have been encouraged, during early discussions, to budget what is appropriate with
justification  for  the  amount.  This  has  allowed  us  to  fund  the  scope  of  work  ade-
quately.
Q3. You  have  described  the  importance  of  venture  capital  in  meeting  the  capital
needs of biotechnology companies because of the high cost and length of product
development.  If  a  venture  capital  firm  has  already  invested  in  an  SBIR  award
recipient,  how  could  the  SBIR  program  be  structured  to  encourage  the  venture
capital company to provide additional investment and commercialization assist-
ance for the SBIR project beyond that offered by the SBIR award itself?

A3. Additional award levels for matching venture funding toward commercialization
of  a  grant  project  may  attract  additional  investment.  Thus  an  SBIR  award  to  com-
plete the technical/clinical aspects of the proposal could be made once a venture cap-
ital  firm  invests  in  the  commercialization  strategy.  This  would  help  mitigate  the
risk  to  the  VC  firm  of  technical  risk  and  let  their  investment  focus  on  the  market
and sustainability risk. Similar to having a academic/clinical collaborator sign on to
assist in demonstration of certain technical or clinical aspects of the SBIR, the ven-
ture  firm  could  be  signed  on  to  assist  in  funding  the  commercialization  aspects  of
the SBIR.
Q4. SBIR  awards  are  granted  in  support  of  agency  missions—in  the  case  of  NIH,
to  make  medical  discoveries  that  improve  health  and  save  lives.  If  the  market
opportunity for an SBIR project is small, what would encourage venture capital
company  financial  support  and  commercialization  assistance  for  the  SBIR
project over time?

A4. I’m  not  sure  that  SBIR  funding  would  necessarily  help  attract  venture  capital
to  a  specific  small  market  opportunity.  If  the  Principal  Investigator  has  a  dem-
onstrated track record of being able to attract SBIR support to multiple projects, has
good  peer  review  feedback  (that  may  be  separate  from  grant  review),  and  can  as-
semble the funded SBIR projects into a cohesive commercialization plan, there may
be an opportunity of attracting venture financing. One key to this is developing rela-
tionships with the funding agency that can speak to the venture investor community
to establish the worth of the discoveries and potential for commercialization.
Q5. What  criteria  do  venture  capital  companies  use  when  making  a  decision  to  in-
vest in a company and a specific project? If a company has venture capital fund-
ing  and  a  company  project  receives  an  SBIR  award,  but  the  project  does  not
meet  venture  capital  criteria  for  investment  upon  completion  of  Phase  II,  how
will  that  project  be  managed?  For  such  an  SBIR  project,  what  are  the  possible
options and issues in spinning out that project to another company?

A5. Certainly  the  venture  community  is  in  the  business  of  risking  capital  for  a  re-
turn to its investors. Given that the VC is investing in the performance of the com-
pany, its primary criteria is based on management’s competency in adding value to
the product portfolio to allow a return on money invested. If a project has a manage-
able  technical  risk,  there  is  compelling  clinical  need,  management  has  capabilities
to achieve significant relevant milestones, and there is a clearly articulated strategy
to achieve a return on investment for the VC, then there should be a clear decision
to invest. If the SBIR program can provide quantification of technical risks, clinical
need  and  demonstration  of  managements  ability  to  achieve  milestones,  then  it
should positively influence investment decisions.

If  a  completed  Phase  II  SBIR  does  not  fit  within  the  companies  strategic  vision
or  opportunity  assessment,  it  should  be  determined  if  it  is  a  marketable  asset
through  licensing  or  outright  sale.  Certainly  intellectual  property  rights  and  con-
fidentiality  may  be  at  issue  if  a  project  is  spun-out  to  another  company.  Of  course
this is a risk that has to be weighed against the potential gains from marketing the
asset.
Q6. What definition do you recommend for an eligible venture capital company when
determining  eligibility  of  an  SBIR  applicant?  What  would  this  definition  in-
clude; what would it exclude?

A6. As a small business program, I believe that the criteria should be employee size
(as  it  is  now)  and  the  revenue/net  profit  size  to  qualify  as  a  small  business  entity.
The  current  small  business  definition  based  on  size  of  500  employees  seems  quite
large.  I  would  base  the  employee  count  strictly  on  full  time  equivalents  (FTE’s)  on
payroll. Further, once a company has reached a critical mass of revenue and bottom-
line  net  profit,  it  should  be  able  to  self-fund  its  research.  It  seems  that  once  a  rea-
sonable amount of revenue is available to fund research, it should be used to do so.
A  benchmark  of  revenue  generating  public  companies  could  be  used  perhaps  to  set
this  bar.  Thus  a  company  with  revenues  of  $20–$50  million  and  5–7  percent  avail-
able  for  research  investment  could  be  considered  as  too  mature  for  the  SBIR  pro-
gram.

Beyond  the  size  constraint,  I  would  also  include  the  ability  of  the  company  to
demonstrate  results  of  impact  of  past  funded  projects  (that  have  been  funded
through Phase II) to have a revenue impact. Without this type of feedback into the
system,  it  could  be  just  funding  good  grant  writers  without  achieving  the  desired
results of making ‘‘medical discoveries that improve health and save lives.’’

Finally,  I  would  redefine  the  term  ‘‘individuals’’  to  allow  venture  capital  backed
companies  to  participate  in  the  program  and  redefine  the  affiliation  rules  for  port-
folio companies.

From  my  understanding,  sound  venture  capital  firms  seek  out  the  best  tech-
nologies  and  management  teams,  which  may  be  the  same  teams  securing  SBIR
grants. The SBIR grant program is one of the key elements in creating a new com-
pany,  especially  in  the  life  sciences  sector.  SBIR  grants,  coupled  with  venture  cap-
ital, provide the critical working capital used by scientists and companies in the dis-
covery  of  new  technologies  and  new  therapeutics.  For  the  past  20  years,  the  dual
financing sources of the SBIR program and the venture capital community have al-
lowed  many  promising  companies  to  conduct  groundbreaking  scientific  research
while  simultaneously  building  viable  businesses  that  bring  innovative  products  to
the marketplace.

STATEMENT OF MS. LINDA OLIVER

ACTING DIRECTOR

OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS

OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

(ACQUISITION, TECHNOLOGY & LOGISTICS)

Review of the Department of Defense (DOD)
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)

and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs

Chairman  Wu,  Congressman  Gingrey  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Tech-
nology and Innovation, House Committee on Science and Technology:

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  submit  a  written  statement  about  the  Small
Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  and  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer
(STTR)  programs  as  you  consider  reauthorization  of  the  SBIR  program  in  the  year
of its 25th anniversary. I welcome this opportunity because these programs have be-
come  important  tools  for  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  to  seed  innovation  in
our  industrial  base,  and,  in  so  doing,  develop  firms  to  supply  leading-edge  tech-
nologies to meet warfighter needs today and in the future.

It  is  the  fundamental  mission  of  the  Department  of  Defense  to  fight  and  win  our
nation’s wars. In a time of war, the challenges are myriad, as we must sustain crit-
ical  operations  around  the  world  while  also  preparing  for  the  future—being  ready
to  face  the  threats  of  tomorrow.  Tasks  of  particular  importance  are  the  supply  of
materiel  to  the  warfighter  to  defeat  identified  threats,  and  the  exploration  and  de-
velopment  of  technologies  to  enable  new  or  lower  cost  capabilities.  To  these  ends,
the  Department  has  established  key  goals  to  ensure  we  are  investing  in  the  right
technologies,  and  cultivating  an  industrial  base  capable  of  meeting  our  strategic
needs.  The  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  play  roles  in  achieving  both  of  these  goals.
Specifically,  consistent  with  statute,  this  means  to  seed  technologies  through  small
firms  which  may  eventually  provide  a  materiel  solution  to  our  nation’s  warfighting
soldiers,  sailors,  marines  and  airmen,  either  directly  as  a  product  or  service,  or  as
part of a larger weapon or support system.

It is our obligation as public officials to ensure that we are using taxpayer dollars
as  productively  and  efficiently  as  possible  for  their  intended  purpose.  In  that  vein,
today  I  will  address  the  questions  presented  to  me  in  your  invitation  and  will  also
highlight  actions  the  Department  has  undertaken  to  improve  our  Program.  We  at
the Department are always ready to work with the Congressional oversight commit-
tees,  other  participating  federal  agencies  and  the  Small  Business  Administration
(SBA) to ensure that the SBIR and STTR programs are as effective as they can pos-
sibly be.
Program Overview

The  DOD  SBIR  Program  encompasses  twelve  constituent  Military  Department
and Defense Agency programs. The participating elements of DOD, hereafter in this
testimony referred to as ‘‘Components,’’ include, in order of largest to smallest budg-
et  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2007  the:  Air  Force,  Navy,  Army,  Missile  Defense  Agency
(MDA),  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA),  Office  of  the  Sec-
retary  of  Defense1 (OSD),  Joint  Office  of  Chemical  and  Biological  Defense  (CBD),
U.S.  Special  Operations  Command  (SOCOM),  Defense  Threat  Reduction  Agency
(DTRA),  Defense  Microelectronics  Activity2 (DMEA),  Defense  Logistics  Agency
(DLA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency3 (NGA). The Department’s SBIR
budget  is  determined  by  a  statutory  2.5  percent  assessment  of  its  extramural4 re-
search,  development,  test  and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  budget.  Each  Component’s  por-
tion  of  the  overall  program  is  managed  to  be  responsive  to  its  specific  mission  and

1 The  OSD  Program  includes  funds  drawn  from  the  Defense  Health  Program  (DHP)  and  is
managed by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Science & Technology) within
the Office of the Director, Defense Research & Engineering.

2 DMEA and DLA are new SBIR participants in FY07.
3 NGA is a voluntary participant in SBIR.
4 Extramural  is  defined  as  the  sum  of  the  total  RDT&E  obligations  minus  amounts  obligated
for  such  activities  by  employees  of  the  participating  agency  in  or  through  government-owned,
government-operated facilities.

corresponding  technology  development  needs  while  also  being  consistent  with  over-
arching Department science and technology guidance.

In  terms  of  budget,  the  Department’s  Program  represents  over  50  percent  of  the
total  federal  SBIR  budget,  which  exceeds  two  billion  dollars.  The  DOD  SBIR  Pro-
gram  has  experienced  substantial  growth  in  recent  years,  more  than  doubling  in
size  from  FY  1999  to  FY  2005  to  over  one  billion  dollars,  and  it  continued  to  grow
through  FY  2007  to  over  $1.13  billion.  This  expansion  is  driven  directly  by  growth
in  underlying  RDT&E  budget,  as  the  set-aside  percentage  has  remained  constant
over  this  period  of  time.  In  FY06,  883  topics  attracted  13,253  Phase  I  proposals,  a
rate  of  15  proposals  per  topic—about  the  average  of  the  prior  four  years.  The  De-
partment awarded 1,862 Phase I contracts and 1,172 Phase II contracts.

Which  firms  received  these  contract  awards?  The  recipients  are  all  types  of  tech-
nology-focused firms from across the country. To a great extent, these are very small
firms. In FY 2006, 68 percent of Phase I contracts were awarded to firms with fewer
than  25  employees,  while  over  42  percent  were  awarded  to  firms  with  fewer  than
10  employees.  This  shows  that,  to  a  great  extent,  the  Department  taps  entrepre-
neurial firms. Entrepreneurial firms tend to offer the most ground-breaking, poten-
tially  disruptive  innovation—the  type  that  fundamentally  changes  how  a  capability
is  provided.  Also  importantly,  the  DOD  SBIR  Program  is  an  entry  point  for  firms
new to the defense business—those seeking to develop a military customer base. In
FY  2006,  21  percent  of  SBIR  Phase  I  award  winners  were  first-time  SBIR  award
recipients.  And  among  the  rest  of  the  firms  receiving  Phase  I  awards  in  FY  2006,
44  percent  had  previously  been  awarded  four  or  fewer  Phase  II  contracts.  Based
again  on  FY  2006  data,  22  percent  of  Phase  I  award  winners  were  minority-  or
women-owned firms, or from Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zones, indi-
cating that a significant portion of resources is utilizing this segment of the business
base, consistent with one of the primary goals of the SBIR program. Since the incep-
tion  of  the  SBIR  program  in  1983,  the  Department  has  awarded  nearly  $11  billion
to qualifying small firms through over 44,500 contracts.

Examining these statistics, it is clear that the DOD SBIR Program is a very large,
resource  intensive  enterprise.  The  central  challenge  is  to  make  the  best  possible
small  business  technology  investments  for  our  warfighters  with  the  resources  the
Congress  provides  us.  That  concludes  a  brief  overview,  focusing  on  the  DOD  SBIR
Program. Let me now move on to address the specific questions posed in the invita-
tion  letter  with  these  overview  remarks  serving  as  background  for  the  discussion.
Program Efficiency and Effectiveness

The  SBIR  and  STTR  programs,  due  to  the  sheer  volume  of  topics,  proposals,  and
awards demand efficiency in execution. In the time since the SBIR program was last
authorized  in  2000,  the  Department  has  provided  over  $5  billion  in  extramural  re-
search and development funding to qualifying small businesses through over 17,000
Phase  I  and  Phase  II  contracts.  On  average,  the  Department  has  consistently  met
the  goals  of  awarding  phase  I  contracts  within  four  months  of  solicitation  closing,
and  awarding  phase  II  contracts  within  six  months  of  the  conclusion  of  the  cor-
responding phase I contracts.

For administrative efficiency and to make it easier for small businesses to interact
with  the  Department,  all  approved  topics  from  participating  components  are  pack-
aged into one solicitation and pre-released to the public for a four-week period. Dur-
ing this period, interested firms may seek additional technical information from the
technical  points  of  contact,  as  necessary,  to  clarify  the  topics.  The  solicitation  then
opens  for  a  four-week  period  during  which  proposals  are  received.  Throughout  the
pre-release  and  solicitation  periods,  interested  firms  may  ask  questions  about  the
topics  of  interest  via  the  online  SBIR/STTR  Interactive  Topic  Information  System
(SITIS).  After  the  solicitation  closes,  all  proposals  are  reviewed  by  government  sci-
entific and technical personnel.

This process occurs three times per year for SBIR and once for the STTR program.
SBIR Phase II proposals are submitted to the Department to meet deadlines estab-
lished  by  participating  DOD  components.  Topic  generation  and  review,  as  well  as
solicitation pre-release, release and proposal submission are entirely electronic, con-
ducted  through  the  DOD  SBIR  Worldwide  Web  site  (www.dodsbir.net).  These  elec-
tronic systems have helped enable the DOD SBIR and STTR programs to accommo-
date  an  increase  in  the  number  of  solicitations  conducted  and  proposals  received
while meeting time-to-award goals.

The high watermark for SBIR/STTR’s effect success or effectiveness in the Depart-
ment  is  bringing  leading-edge  technology  solutions  to  the  warfighter  by  leveraging
the unique, entrepreneurial power of small businesses. Of course, the dictionary def-
inition of efficiency is the ratio of the useful output (effect) of a program to the total
input. We’ve discussed the inputs, or costs, elsewhere in this statement. Let’s spend

a few moments on the outputs. Accurately quantifying the full impact of technology
innovation  is  a  challenge.  We  measure  program  output  in  the  form  of  both  docu-
mented success stories and commercialization data, using follow-on sales and invest-
ment as a proxy for value creation.

The  Department  collects  commercialization  data  from  firms  on  all  Phase  II  con-
tracts and asks firms to keep this data current. Updates are requested annually and
when  firms  submit  proposals.  Both  the  strength  and  weakness  of  this  data  set  is
that it is self-reported by firms. The Department is thus reliant upon them to report
accurate and timely figures. A drawback to this reporting process is that we do not
capture  commercialization  accruing  to  firms  that  have  ‘‘graduated’’  from  the  pro-
gram,  growing  to  be  ineligible  for  future  awards  either  through  organic  expansion
or via acquisition.

Commercialization  may  be  quite  substantial,  perhaps  rendering  our  data  a  con-
servative estimate of program impact. Despite this limitation, Phase II investments
of  $6.7  billion  in  fiscal  years  1984–2004  have  generated  total  reported  commer-
cialization  of  nearly  $13  billion  in  sales,  additional  R&D,  and  capital  investment.
Allowing  three  to  four  years  after  the  completion  of  Phase  II  for  commercialization
to  develop,  about  65  percent  of  SBIR  topics—statements  of  technology  need—gen-
erate  some  recorded  commercialization,5 while  nearly  30  percent  of  topics  generate
commercialization in excess typical investment levels.6 Considering these aggregate
program output measures, the SBIR and STTR programs are stimulating the devel-
opment  and  sales  of  innovation  within  the  Department  and  the  broader  economy.
In  addition  to  measuring  financial  outcomes,  we  track  program  success  stories,
which demonstrate in a more concrete way the value the SBIR and STTR programs
bring to specific customers. Perhaps the most vivid example of such a success story
is Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI) and Enhance Small Arms Protective Inserts
(E–SAPI)  plates,  which  protect  warfighters  in  theaters  of  operation  from  assault
rifle  and  other  small  arms  fire.  Based  on  work  done  under  FY  2000  and  FY  2003
Navy  SBIR  contracts  for  vehicle  armor,  and  a  significant  amount  of  follow-on  re-
search  and  development,  ArmorWorks,  Inc.  of  Tempe,  Arizona  developed  high  tech-
nology  body  armor  plates  for  the  Interceptor  Body  Armor  System  using  advanced
ceramic materials. To date, the firm has supplied hundreds of thousands of ceramic
armor plates for use in personal (SAPI and E–SAPI), vehicular and aircraft applica-
tions, saving lives of U.S. warfighters every day.

A  second  excellent  example  of  a  success  story  is  the  Army  SBIR-originated  Cock-
pit Air Bag System, designed and manufactured by Simula, Inc of Phoenix, Arizona.
Composed of air bags, gas generators, and a unique three-axis crash sensor, the sys-
tem  is  designed  to  protect  helicopter  aircrew  from  potentially  fatal  impacts  in  the
event  of  a  crash.  The  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force,  and  Federal  Aviation  Administration
all participated in the joint development of this system, leveraging prior SBIR-fund-
ed work and leading to a 2001 production contract. Simula, Inc. has already fielded
the system on hundreds of DOD aircraft.

A  third  example  of  a  success  story  is  the  Phraselator,  a  hand-held  speech  trans-
lation  device  developed  by  Marine  Acoustics,  Inc.  (MAI),  a  veteran-owned  small
business based in Middletown, Rhode Island, through an FY 2001 DARPA SBIR ef-
fort.7 Following  the  terrorist  attack  in  September  of  2001,  just  seven  months  into
their  Phase  II  contract,  DARPA  requested  that  MAI  accelerate  development  of  a
prototype  Phraselator.  MAI  proved  quite  capable,  delivering  200  units  in  a  matter
of  weeks  to  U.S.  military  forces  for  use  in  Afghanistan  during  Operation  Enduring
Freedom. Over 5,000 Phraselators are now in use in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around
the  world,  and  they  were  used  extensively  in  tsunami  relief  efforts.  There  is  poten-
tially  a  large  commercial  market  for  the  devices,  which  are  particularly  helpful  in
law enforcement and medical applications where situational urgency may not allow
time for an interpreter to arrive on the scene.

A final example highlights the ability of SBIR-funded technologies to save the De-
partment money by providing capabilities at a lower cost. It also highlights how two
military departments can work together to develop mutually beneficial technologies
and  then  employ  the  technology  rapidly  to  meet  an  emerging  warfighter  need.
JENTEK  Sensors,  Inc  of  Waltham,  Massachusetts  developed  a  thin,  conformable

6 Commercialization  figures  are  drawn  from  the  firm-reported  DOD  SBIR  Commercialization
Database  and  encompass  phase  I  awards  made  1990–2003.  Topic  commercialization  rates  are
calculated  as  the  mean  of  yearly  averages  over  this  period  of  time.  Considering  only  DOD-de-
rived  sales  or  investment  (via  prime  or  subcontract),  42  percent  of  topics  generated  some  com-
mercialization while 13 percent generated commercialization in excess of the typical investment
amount. Typical investment is set at $850,000, the combined value of Phase I and Phase II con-
tracts based on statutory guidelines.

sensor  system  to  perform  inspections  on  difficult-to-access  locations  of  military  sys-
tems. Using the same Phase III contract, Navy Depots were purchasing the sensors
to  inspect  P–3  propeller  blades  while  the  Air  Force  was  adding  additional  funding
to  miniaturize  the  sensors  for  use  in  difficult-to-access  areas.  A  serious  problem
emerged  with  weld  joints  on  some  compressor  blades  threatening  planes  to  be
grounded.  The  technology  available  at  the  time  was  to  disassemble  and  X-ray  each
blade at a cost of $200,000 and considerable down time. In response to a Wednesday
phone  call,  Jentek  quickly  found  a  solution  employing  the  Air  Force  modifications
under  development.  On  the  following  Monday,  depot  technicians  were  able  to  com-
plete  a  plane  inspection  in  an  hour  using  the  ‘‘meandering,  wandering  magne-
tometer’’ technology at a cost of less than $20,000.
Contract Award Guidelines: Flexibility Is Key

In FY 2006, the average DOD Phase I award was $89,300 and the average Phase
II  was  $720,800.  Approximately  30  percent  of  these  awards  were  modified  due  to
participation  in  the  Fast  Track  and  Phase  II  Enhancement  programs  or  to  address
technical  or  mission  needs.  Among  this  set  of  awards,  the  average  contract  award
was about $135,000 for Phase I and $1.1M for Phase II.

Current  contract  award  guidelines  are  $100,000  for  Phase  I  and  $750,000  for
Phase  II.  These  have  been  in  place  since  1992  for  the  SBIR  program  and  have  not
been increased to reflect inflation’s impact on the price of research and development.
The Department would support any SBA effort to increase these statutory and regu-
latory guidelines.

The cost of technology development and prototyping is part dependent on the type
of  technology  being  developed—some  technologies  are  more  expensive  than  others.
For  example,  manufacturing-related  initiatives  can  run  into  the  millions  of  dollars
to  effectively  prototype  and  demonstrate.  Additionally,  test,  evaluation  and  valida-
tion can be quite expensive for technologies destined for military use. Thus, regard-
less  of  the  level  of  the  award  guidelines,  technology  cost  variability  and  the  often
high  cost  of  bringing  technologies  to  a  transition-ready  maturity  level  militate  for
flexibility  in  program  execution.8 Thus,  the  Department  appreciates  the  flexibility
to  judiciously  go  beyond  the  proscribed  guidelines  when  necessary  to  be  responsive
to technology transition opportunities and produce successful outcomes.
Small Business Participation: Competition Provides Program Vitality

By almost any measure, the interest and participation in the SBIR and STTR pro-
grams has been strong. Small business participation in the DOD SBIR & STTR pro-
grams has been very strong. In fiscal years 2003–2006, the Department received an
average of about 15 proposals per SBIR topic and 11 proposals per STTR topic. Prior
to  that,  between  fiscal  years  1998  and  2001,  the  average  was  under  11  proposals
per SBIR topic and nine proposals per STTR topic. The programs fund only the best
proposals  in  Phase  I  and  only  the  ‘‘best-of-the-best’’  go  on  to  Phase  II.  Historical
Phase I funding rates are 14 percent for SBIR and 20 percent for STTR, with Phase
II conversion rates of just below 50 percent for both programs.9

Outreach activities are important to ensure that small businesses have the oppor-
tunity  to  learn  about  the  programs.  Outreach  is  primarily  conducted  through  at-
tending  conferences  planned  for  this  purpose,  and  through  making  information
available  to  the  public,  primarily  via  the  Internet.  The  Department  and  its  compo-
nents  support  as  many  conferences  as  time  and  resources  allow.  Strong  support  of
two  national  conferences  and  several  regional  and  state  events  is  the  norm.  Addi-
tionally,  information  contained  on  the  DOD  and  on  DOD  component  web  pages  is
quite significant, permitting interested firms to learn virtually anything they might
want to know about the programs. To supplement, the Department staffs a toll-free
help-desk to answer questions firms have about the programs.

As discussed earlier, the SBIR and STTR programs are often gateways to the de-
fense  market  space  for  firms,  a  way  for  firms  to  test  the  market  and  be  tested  as
a potential new supplier. In fiscal year 2006, around 20 percent of Phase I awardees
were first time award recipients while 29 percent of phase II award recipients never
received  a  phase  II  award  before.  These  are  important  benchmarks.  To  maintain  a
vital,  innovative  supplier  base,  particularly  for  new  technologies,  it  is  imperative
that the Department encourage new and non-traditional firms to get involved.

8 As  a  general  rule,  a  Technology  Readiness  Level  (TRL)  of  at  least  six  (meaning  a  prototype
has been demonstrated on a relevant environment) is required for system development to begin.

Financing and Commercialization

The  Department  employs  several  mechanisms  to  address  the  funding  gaps  in  the
phased  award  structure,  increase  private  equity  participation,  provide  commer-
cialization  assistance,  and  ultimately  help  increase  small  businesses’  share  of  fed-
eral  procurement  and  non-SBIR/STTR  R&D.  First,  commercialization  potential
plays  a  central  role  in  proposals  and  source  selection.  Two  of  three  criteria  address
this issue:

• qualifications  of  the  firm  and  team  to  perform  the  research  and  development

and commercialize the results, and;

• the commercialization10 potential of the proposed solution.

Further, firms with four or more prior SBIR Phase II contracts are assigned a Com-
mercialization  Achievement  Index  (CAI)  score,  which  is  a  measure  of  how  well  the
firm  has  commercialized  prior  SBIR  technology  relative  to  peers  with  the  same
number of Phase II awards. Firms with a CAI in the lowest fifteen percentile—those
with the worst record of commercialization—receive fewer points in source selection.
To  address  the  funding  gap  between  Phase  I  and  Phase  II,  many  DOD  compo-
nents employ a Phase I contract option to fund research and development while the
Phase II proposal is evaluated for funding. When this approach is taken, it virtually
always  takes  the  Phase  I  award  amount  above  the  statutory  and  regulatory  guide-
line,  triggering  a  reporting  requirement.  The  Fast  Track  program  also  offers  gap
funding to qualified proposals while also attracting external matching funds.

The Phase II Enhancement program (also known as Phase II Plus) offers program
funding  to  match  qualifying  external  funding,  sometimes  (but  not  always)  from  a
non-SBIR/STTR  DOD  source  such  as  a  laboratory  or  system  program  office,  to  fur-
ther  develop,  demonstrate,  test,  and  validate  the  technology.  The  Department’s
analysis  shows  that  both  the  Fast  Track  and  Phase  II  Enhancement  programs  are
associated with systematically higher levels of commercialization.

As  with  the  Phase  I  contact  option,  Phase  II  Enhancements  virtually  always  in-
crease the Phase II award level beyond the statutory and regulatory guidelines, trig-
gering  a  reporting  requirement.  Preliminary  analysis  shows  there  is  more  interest
among  the  components  in  performing  Phase  II  Enhancements  than  in  Fast  Track.
This  is  probably  because  the  matching  funds  are  brought  to  bear  later  in  the  re-
search  and  development  cycle  when  technology  transition  issues  are  more  likely  to
be defined, and the potential of the technology is better understood.

Technical  assistance  programs  offer  federal  agencies  the  opportunity  to  provide
targeted  aid  to  SBIR  and  STTR  award  recipients  to  increase  their  chances  of  suc-
cess.  Section  9(q)  of  the  Small  Business  Act  currently  permits  $4,000  per  Phase  I
award  and  $4,000  per  year  per  Phase  II  award  to  be  used  to  provide  such  assist-
ance.  However,  to  make  the  authority  more  useful  and  effective,  the  Department
recommends a couple of changes:

tion; and,

• increase  to  $5,000  per  Phase  I  award  to  reflect  the  economic  impact  of  infla-
• increase  Phase  II  assistance  to  up  to  $8,000  per  year,  and  permit  federal
agencies  to  provide  the  assistance  directly  or  through  the  Phase  II  contract.
The  suggested  increase  in  the  level  of  assistance  for  Phase  II  reflects  a  more  real-
istic cost of providing meaningful assistance to firms that need to cultivate markets
for  their  innovations  while  simultaneously  developing  their  technologies  and  capac-
ity to produce them.

Within the DOD program, few components currently provide direct commercializa-
tion assistance. The adjustments suggested above and in the section 824 of the Ad-
ministration’s proposed National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 for-
warded to the Congress on February 6, 2007 (NDAA for FY08), will make the tech-
nical assistance more attractive and probably increase the likelihood that DOD com-
ponents and other federal agencies will use the authority.

10 Commercialization  refers  to  the  process  of  developing  marketable  products  or  services  and
producing  and  delivering  products  or  services  for  sale  (whether  by  the  originating  party  or  by
others), to government and/or non-government markets. Funds data reported as commercializa-
tion  includes  the  receipt  of  money  for  the  performance  of  follow-on  R&D  (as  government-sup-
plied Phase III funds or other sources) and the collection of funds from investors. A related term
is SBIR Phase III, which refers specifically to work that derives from, extends, or logically con-
cludes effort(s) performed under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other
than the SBIR program. Phase III work is thus typically oriented toward commercializing SBIR
research  or  technology.  The  terms  are  often  used  synonymously  and  interchangeably  when  de-
scribing outcomes beyond SBIR Phase II.

Administrative Costs

107

SBIR/STTR  program  administration  is  quite  resource  intensive.  This  is  in  large
part due to the phased program structure and contract award guidelines, which re-
sult in thousands of individual contracts. Each contract requires associated Depart-
mental  overhead  for  topic  development  and  review,  pre-release  and  solicitation
interaction with industry, technical evaluation and source selection, contracting, and
technical  oversight  and  coordination,  among  other  activities.  Preliminary  estimates
by  the  RAND  Corporation  put  this  overhead  at  or  above  five  percent  of  program
budget, varying by component.11

The  SBIR  and  STTR  set-aside  budgets  are  drawn  from  previously  programmed,
budgeted  and  appropriated  funds  for  other  programs,  which  when  budgeted  con-
tained resources for administration of these funds. Thus, the SBIR and STTR budg-
ets contain funds that were identified to support administrative activities. However,
the set-aside budgets for SBIR or STTR may not be used to support program admin-
istration. Support funding thus must be drawn from other sources.

A  legislative  change  proposed  by  section  823  of  the  NDAA  for  FY  2008  would
allow  up  to  three  percent  of  the  SBIR  and  STTR  set-aside  budgets  to  be  used  to
fund  administrative  expenses.  The  most  important  activities  requiring  these  re-
sources are contracting, technical oversight, and program coordination with systems
developers  and  end-users.  Benefits  derived  from  this  change  will  ultimately  mani-
fest themselves in overall program performance, such as through the aggregate rate
and  magnitude  of  commercialization  achieved.  Modification  of  the  current  discre-
tionary technical assistance authority (15 U.S.C. 638(q) ), as suggested above, would
provide  ample  resources  for  this  task,  particularly  when  combined  with  resources
made  available  through  the  Commercialization  Pilot  Program  (CPP)  authority  (15
U.S.C.  638(y) ).  Lastly,  I  would  caution  against  raising  the  program  set-aside  from
the  current  2.5  percent  absent  analytically  solid  determination  that  such  a  change
would produce value in excess of the additional direct and opportunity costs it would
impose.
Conclusion

To conclude, I would like to recognize the efforts of our DOD SBIR program man-
agers and the civilian and uniformed technical representatives and contracting offi-
cers, as well as contractors that support them. These dedicated, professional individ-
uals  work  hard,  day  in  and  day  out,  to  ensure  that  our  SBIR  dollars  are  spent  on
the most promising and relevant technologies. They don’t always see immediate re-
sults from their labors—that is the nature of early-stage research and development
(R&D).  However,  when  projects  develop  into  useful  military  products,  the  fruits  of
their  labor  can  be  seen  saving  lives  and  contributing  to  a  wide  variety  of  missions
in  Iraq,  Afghanistan,  and  elsewhere  around  the  world.  We  need  not  look  further
than  these  places  to  see  that  the  program  can  make  a  positive  impact,  and  that  is
due directly to their efforts.

In  summary,  again  I  thank  you,  Chairman  Wu,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on
the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs.  I  hope  my  testimony  has  provided  you  with  an  un-
derstanding  of  how  we  run  the  program  at  the  Department  and  will  assist  in  you
and  your  colleagues  as  you  consider  program  reauthorization.  I  would  be  happy  to
answer any questions you and the Members of the Subcommittee may have.

STATEMENT OF DR. NORKA RUIZ BRAVO

DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH

OFFICE OF EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee:  I
am Dr. Norka Ruiz Bravo, Deputy Director for Extramural Research at the National
Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  an  agency  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services  (HHS).  The  NIH  is  the  primary  federal  agency  for  conducting  and  sup-
porting biomedical research.

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  for  the  record  testimony  about  the  Small
Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  program  and  the  Small  Business  Technology
Transfer  Program  (STTR)  and  ways  to  strengthen  the  participation  of  small  busi-
nesses in the NIH SBIR/STTR programs.
IMPORTANCE OF SBIR/STTR PROGRAMS AT NIH

The  NIH  mission  is  to  uncover  new  knowledge  that  will  lead  to  better  health  for
everyone.  Helping  to  lead  the  way  toward  important  medical  discoveries,  NIH-sup-
ported  scientists  investigate  ways  to  prevent  disease  as  well  as  investigate  the
causes, treatments, and cures for diseases and disabilities. The key to achieving our
mission  is  that  the  rapid  and  fundamental  advances  in  biomedical  and  behavioral
sciences will be translated into prevention strategies and clinical treatments for rare
and common diseases and then further applied to real-world practice. With new sci-
entific  discoveries  comes  the  opportunity  for  small  businesses  to  translate  research
results into the commercial marketplace.

The SBIR/STTR programs provide qualified small business concerns with opportu-
nities  to  propose  innovative  ideas  and  to  explore  their  technological  potential.
Projects  funded  through  the  NIH  SBIR/STTR  programs  focus  on  commercialization
of the outcomes of research. The SBIR/STTR programs are fully integrated into the
NIH  research  agenda,  particularly  with  respect  to  promoting  innovative,  cutting-
edge research ideas, as well as translating scientific findings and advances into tan-
gible  benefits  for  the  American  people.  Thus,  they  serve  to  supplement—but  not
supplant or diminish—the traditional research programs of NIH.

The  NIH  SBIR  program  and  STTR  program  represent  about  98  percent  and  100
percent, respectively, of HHS’ programs in these areas. The NIH contributes the sec-
ond largest amount of SBIR/STTR funding across the Federal Government. In fiscal
year  (FY)  2006,  the  NIH  SBIR  program  provided  over  $580  million  to  fund  1,275
new  Phase  I  (feasibility  testing)  and  Phase  II  (product  research  and  development)
SBIR  projects.  We  provided  more  than  $70  million  to  fund  nearly  200  new  Phase
I  and  Phase  II  STTR  projects.  Since  the  programs’  inception,  the  NIH  has  invested
more  than  $5  billion  in  more  than  19,000  projects  to  over  5,000  small  businesses.
PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS: BRINGING IDEAS TO LIFE

The NIH SBIR/STTR programs are focused on creating research opportunities for
U.S. small businesses to stimulate technological innovation and to translate discov-
eries  into  products/services  that  will  improve  human  health.  The  programs  seek  to
fund  the  most  scientifically  promising  projects  for  which  private  and  public  funds
are not traditionally available. As noted from the few examples below, the program
has  shown  that  tangible  scientific  benefits  can  result  from  a  small  investment  in
early-stage ideas with commercial potential but uncertain verification or feasibility.
• GlycoFi  Inc.  (NH),  a  biotherapeutics  company,  used  the  NIH  SBIR  program
to  explore  the  feasibility  of  making  injectable  proteins—so  called  ‘‘biotech
drugs’’—using  a  glycoengineered  yeast  strain.  GlycoFi’s  work  is  an  example
of  exciting  translational  research  where  they  use  an  innovative  approach
called  GlycoDesignΤΜ to  control  a  protein’s  glycans  (sugars)  in  order  to  opti-
mize  a  therapeutic  protein.  GlycoFi  demonstrated  successfully  the  technical
feasibility to develop a yeast system for producing therapeutic drugs in large
scale.  In  May  2006,  this  six-year-old  company  was  acquired  by  Merck  &  Co.
for  about  $400  million  in  cash,  the  largest  such  deal  ever  reported  for  a  pri-
vate biotechnology company.
• IntraLase  Corporation  (CA)  used  SBIR  funding  to  develop  a  safer  and  more
precise  way  to  create  the  corneal  flap  in  LASIK  surgery.  Today,  using  a
bladeless  technology  to  generate  light  pulses  as  short  as  one-quadrillionth  of
a  second,  IntraLase’s  femtosecond  laser  technology  is  improving  the  safety
and efficacy of laser vision correction.

• Electrical  Geodesics  Inc.  (OR)  has  used  the  SBIR  program  to  develop  impor-
tant research tools. It has developed a new generation of high-resolution elec-
troencephalogram (EEG) measurement and analysis systems for use in medi-
cine,  psychology,  and  neuroscience  research.  Based  on  a  patented  Geodesic
Sensor Net technology, EGI’s systems are now in use in research laboratories
in  the  U.S.,  Europe,  and  Asia,  in  projects  ranging  from  infant  language  com-
prehension to EEG pathology in dementia.

• Altea  Therapeutics  (GA)  has  used  NIH  SBIR  funding  to  develop  the  Pass-
PortΤΜ System,  which  enables  fast,  controlled  delivery  of  drugs  (e.g.,  insulin)
and  vaccines  painlessly  through  the  skin  using  a  needleless  infusion  patch.
These  examples  demonstrate  why  the  SBIR/STTR  programs  are  important  to  the
innovation  process.  Marking  the  25th  year  of  the  existence  of  the  SBIR  program,
the time is ripe to reflect on how the programs have evolved and matured over time
and  to  consider  ways  to  develop  program  operations  to  improve  program  efficiency
and effectiveness.
PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY IS KEY: ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL

The SBIR program now includes 11 participating agencies, each with very diverse
missions. NIH attributes the success and effectiveness of its program to several fac-
tors,  the  most  significant  of  which  is  flexibility  in  our  proactive  administration  of
the  program  to  accommodate  the  changing  nature  of  biomedical  and  behavioral  re-
search  while  increasing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  program.  These
changes were focused on addressing the needs of a diverse business community, in-
cluding  multiple  industries,  different  technology  sectors,  and  diverse  product  out-
comes.

Examples  of  program  flexibility  include  the  ability  to  provide  funding  levels  that
in  some  instances  exceed  the  norm  established  in  Small  Business  Administration
(SBA) guidelines; the ability to propose research projects in the fields that have the
most biological potential; the use of less rigid receipt dates; the permissibility of ap-
plication resubmissions and gap funding options, including a Phase I/Phase II Fast-
Track  option  to  accelerate  projects  that  have  great  potential  for  commercialization;
and the opportunity to compete for Phase II Competing Renewal awards for projects
that must address FDA regulatory requirements (e.g., clinical evaluation).

Simply stated, one size does not fit all. Flexibility is key, particularly in address-

ing the current challenges noted below.
PHASE I/PHASE II AWARD LEVELS

The  median  award  size  in  FY  2006  was  $143,725  for  Phase  I  and  $415,952  per
year for Phase II projects. Our experience is that the conduct of certain types of bio-
medical research, such as nanotechnology, clinically-related studies, vaccine develop-
ment, and drug discovery, do not routinely lend themselves to prescribed maximum
time  and  dollar  levels.  NIH  appreciates  the  flexibility  that  the  SBA  has  provided
to exceed their guidelines, where appropriate, for particular projects, rather than to
restrict  ideas  to  projects  that  can  only  be  conducted  under  a  prescribed  amount  of
time and money. Accordingly, we encourage small business concerns to propose real-
istic  budgets  and  project  periods  appropriate  for  the  successful  completion  of  an
SBIR project.
SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION

Outreach  is  an  important  link  to  the  participation  of  small  businesses  in  the
SBIR/STTR  programs.  We  are  continually  enhancing  our  outreach  efforts  at  con-
ferences  and  forums  aimed  at  increasing  participation  of  all  small  businesses,  and
particularly  socially  and  economically-disadvantaged  and  women-owned  small  busi-
nesses;  the  Small  Business  Veterans  Conference  and  the  Alabama  A&M  University
2007  SBIR/STTR  Small  Business  Conference  are  just  two  examples.  In  addition  to
outreach, NIH provides administrative supplements to NIH SBIR/STTR awardees to
improve  the  diversity  of  the  research  workforce  by  supporting  and  recruiting  stu-
dents, post-doctorates, and eligible investigators from groups that have been shown
to be under-represented.
SUSTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE SBIR PROGRAM

Small  businesses  are  increasingly  recognized  as  important  contributors  and  part-
ners to technological innovation. Yet small business participation in the NIH SBIR/
STTR programs is experiencing another trend of decreases. SBIR/STTR has been de-
creasing since FY 2004, as it did in FY 2001, at a time when non-SBIR applications
have  increased  significantly.  In  FY  2006,  NIH  saw  a  nearly  15  percent  decrease
from the number of SBIR applications submitted in FY 2005 (see chart below). This

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00115 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

reoccurrence of decreases is of serious concern to NIH, and we understand that sev-
eral other agencies are also experiencing a decrease in submissions.

110

The  downward  trend  may  be  the  result  of  several  factors.  Some  firms  are  no
longer  eligible.  Some  have  gone  out  of  business.  Some  firms  are  new  start-ups  that
have not yet fully developed the necessary infrastructure to successfully compete for
an  award.  Some  believe  the  time  and  cost  for  applying  relative  to  the  award  levels
is  not  a  sufficient  opportunity  incentive.  (Only  about  one-third  of  our  SBIR  and
STTR  awardees  are  new  to  the  program  each  year.)  NIH  encourages  small  busi-
nesses  to  participate  in  the  SBIR/STTR  programs  and  to  use  the  programs  as  one,
but not the only, resource for funding innovative, commercially viable ideas. In con-
sidering  ways  to  increase  the  participation  of  innovative  small  businesses  in  the
SBIR/STTR  programs,  NIH  plans  to  give  preference  to  new  firms  that  have  never
received NIH SBIR/STTR awards and/or to firms that respond to agency-specific pri-
orities,  given  a  firm’s  level  of  expertise  and  evidence  of  likely  ability  to  produce  in-
novative products.
FINANCING AND COMMERCIALIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

SBIR/STTR  program  reauthorizations  have  consistently  emphasized  the  goal  of
addressing  financing  gaps  toward  product  commercialization  by  requiring  agencies
to  include  as  a  review  criterion  the  commercial  potential  of  proposed  projects.  To
help  NIH  SBIR  awardees  navigate  this  proverbial  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  and  move  their
products  into  the  marketplace,  NIH  has  developed  a  menu  of  technical  assistance
programs  that  provide  technical  and/or  commercialization  assistance  specific  to  the
companies’ individual needs. These programs are:

Technology  Niche  Assessment  (TNAΤΜ)  Program:  The  TNAΤΜ program  assesses
the market opportunities and needs and concerns of the end-users and helps to dis-
cover new markets for possible entry.

CAP:  CAP  provides  Phase  II  awardees  with  assistance  in  developing  and  imple-
menting an appropriate business strategy that will help commercialize the products
that  have  resulted  from  their  SBIR  research  projects.  CAP  is  having  positive  im-
pacts on some SBIR companies seeking investments and partnerships. For example,
Cytograft  Tissue  Engineering  (CTE)  received  SBIR  funding  that  enabled  the  com-
pany  to  explore  the  potential  of  an  innovative  technology  to  create  a  living  blood
vessel  called  LifelineΤΜ.  This  exciting  medical  advancement  has  potential  for  coro-
nary  bypass  candidates,  lower  limb  amputation  candidates,  and  hemodialysis  pa-
tients. As a CAP participant, CTE has raised $17 million in private equity financing
to fund some of their clinical studies.

Pilot Manufacturing Assistance Program: In FY 2007, NIH initiated a pilot assist-
ance  program  together  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program to help companies with mak-
ing manufacturing decisions when developing their operational transition strategies
(e.g.,  method  of  scale-up,  quality  control,  prototyping,  facility  design,  vendor  identi-
fication and selection, plant layout).

111

NIH believes the technical assistance to SBIR awardees is very important in help-

ing companies transition to the marketplace.

PARTNERS: GOVERNMENT AND SMALL BUSINESS

The overarching intent of the SBIR program was stated best by President Reagan
in signing the initial legislation: ‘‘We in government must work in partnership with
small  businesses  to  ensure  that  technologies  and  processes  are  readily  transferred
to  commercial  applications.’’  As  researchers  tackle  ever  more  complex  biomedical
challenges  and  the  rising  cost  of  scientific  research,  strategic  partnerships  between
NIH  and  private  industry  are  becoming  more  important  for  advancing  science  and
communicating results of medical advances to improve the quality of life for all peo-
ple.

NIH is committed to increasing the participation of small businesses in the SBIR/
STTR  programs,  ensuring  that  only  small  business  concerns  receive  SBIR/STTR
awards, and encouraging the participation of new start-up SBIR/STTR firms by giv-
ing them preference in award selection, much like new investigators are often given
preference  in  traditional  research  grant  programs  (see  http://grants.nih.gov/
grants/new¥investigators/institute¥center¥practices.htm).  We  need  to  find  ways  to
innovate  and  collaborate,  and  promote  scientific  advances,  and  take  advantage  of
every opportunity to improve public health.
CONCLUSION

In  conclusion,  it  is  our  intention  and  hope  that  SBIR/STTR  programs  will  con-
tinue  to  maintain  their  integrity  and  ensure  that  technology  developments  will  be
translated and disseminated for the benefit of all Americans.

Thank you for the opportunity to share with you my thoughts regarding the SBIR/

STTR programs.

STATEMENT OF LARRY JAMES

SBIR/STTR PROGRAM MANAGER
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee:  thank  you  for  giving  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  (DOE)  the  opportunity  to  provide  this  Statement  for  the  Record
about  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  and  Small  Business  Tech-
nology Transfer (STTR) programs at the Department.

The  DOE  Office  of  Science  (SC)  manages  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  for  the
Department  and  has  done  so  since  the  SBIR  program  was  formed  in  1982  and  the
STTR  program  in  1992.  In  addition  to  SC,  six  other  DOE  programs  participate  in
the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs:  the  Offices  of  Fossil  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency  and
Renewable  Energy,  Nuclear  Energy,  Environmental  Management,  Defense  Nuclear
Nonproliferation, and Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The Department’s
naval  reactors  and  weapons  activities  programs  are  exempt  by  law  and  do  not  con-
tribute to SBIR and STTR programs.

The  SBIR/STTR  programs  are  viewed  within  the  Department  like  any  other  re-
search and development (R&D) program, namely, as a vehicle by which the Depart-
ment  accomplishes  its  R&D  objectives.  The  Department  has  benefited  from  small
business participation through the research and resultant new knowledge and tech-
nologies  developed  by  small  businesses  that  have  supported  various  Department
R&D  activities  over  the  years.  Examples  of  commercialization  successes  from  the
programs include development of new photovoltaic systems for utility scale solar en-
ergy production, shock-resistant and temperature-tolerant ceramics for more energy
efficient engines, and fast-growing hybrid poplar trees as a sustainable and economi-
cal  biomass  energy  source.  Successful  collaborations  between  small  businesses  and
the  DOE  laboratory  complex  have  also  led  to  new  insights  and  innovative  tech-
nologies that enable advancement of the Department’s program missions; for exam-
ple,  technologies  that  will  significantly  improve  the  performance  of  current  and  fu-
ture DOE scientific user facilities.
Program Effectiveness

The  statutory  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  have  several  purposes:  (a)  to  stimulate
technological innovation; (b) to use small businesses to meet federal R&D needs; (c)
to  foster  and  encourage  participation  by  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged
small businesses; and (d) to increase private sector commercialization of innovations
derived from federal R&D.

In  accordance  with  the  U.S.  Small  Business  Administration’s  (SBA)  SBIR  Policy
Directive, the SBIR program is administered in three phases. Phase I is to evaluate
the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of ideas that appear to have commer-
cial  potential  or  meet  the  internal  needs  of  the  Department.  Phase  II  builds  on
Phase I work and comprises the core research and development effort. Phase III re-
fers  to  work  that  derives  from,  extends,  or  logically  concludes  efforts  performed
under  SBIR  funding  agreements,  but  is  not  itself  funded  by  the  SBIR  program.
Phase  III  work  is  typically  oriented  towards  private  sector  commercialization  or  di-
rect  transition  of  the  SBIR  research  or  technology  into  the  Department’s  research
complex.  That  is,  the  SBIR  funding  pays  for  research  or  R&D  meeting  DOE  objec-
tives  (Phases  I  and  II);  non-SBIR  capital  provides  follow-on  developmental  funding
to meet commercial or program specific objectives (Phase III).

The SBIR and STTR programs both involve a two-phased research approach. The
major  difference  between  the  SBIR  and  the  STTR  programs  is  that  STTR  grants
must involve substantial cooperative research collaboration between the small busi-
ness and a research institution. At least 40 percent of the research or analytical ef-
fort  must  be  allocated  to  the  small  business,  and  at  least  30  percent  of  the  effort
must  be  allocated  to  a  single  research  institution.  The  percent  set-aside  for  the
STTR  is  small,  0.3  percent,  relative  to  the  SBIR  set-aside  at  2.5  percent  of  federal
agency extramural R&D budgets.

The Department’s SBIR and STTR programs’ goals include: 1) funding high qual-
ity projects with relevance to the Department’s mission needs; 2) increasing private-
sector  commercialization  and  Departmental  transition  of  technology  developed
through  DOE  SBIR-supported  R&D;  3)  stimulating  technological  innovation  in  the
private sector; and 4) improving the return on investment from federally-funded re-
search for economic and social benefits to the Nation.

The  Department  believes  its  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  are  meeting  these  objec-
tives.  SBIR  and  STTR  program  performance  compares  favorably  with  that  of  other
DOE research programs. The DOE SBIR and STTR programs have and continue to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:27 Apr 19, 2008 Jkt 034718 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\042607\34718 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

113

support  high-quality,  competitive  R&D,  which  results  in  spin-off  companies,  new
technologies, and knowledge which all contribute to advancing DOE missions.

DOE’s SBIR program is also a model for the provision of commercialization assist-
ance.  According  to  the  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA),  DOE  was  the  first
agency  to  offer  commercialization  assistance  to  awardees,  beginning  in  1990.
Awards  from  the  SBIR  program  help  small  businesses  attract  outside  investment
by  affirming  that  the  companies  have  excellent  technical  capability,  thus  reducing
some  of  the  uncertainty  involved  in  early-stage  investment.  Several  comprehensive
reviews of the federal SBIR and STTR programs by the Government Accountability
Office (GAO) have found it to be successful in enhancing the role of small businesses
in  federal  R&D  across  the  participating  agencies,  stimulating  commercialization  of
research  results,  and  supporting  the  participation  of  small  businesses  (Testimony
Before  the  Subcommittee  on  Environment,  Technology,  and  Standards,  Committee
on  Science,  House  of  Representatives,  Federal  Research:  Observations  on  the  Small
Business  Innovation  Research  Program,  June,  28  2005,  GAO–05–861T,  and  ref-
erences therein).

The  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  DOE  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  could  po-

tentially be improved with two changes in the allocation of set-aside funds:
(1) Increase the provisions for discretionary technical assistance within the existing
set-aside  allowed  by  law  under  SBIR.  SBA-directed  funding  limits  in  Phase  I  and
Phase II are not adequate to support a strong technical assistance program, includ-
ing  commercialization  assistance.  Currently  up  to  $4,000  in  Phase  I  (above  the
awarded amount) can be used per award for commercialization assistance activities
and  up  to  $4,000  per  year  per  award  in  Phase  II  (included  as  part  of  the  awarded
amount)  can  be  used  towards  these  activities.  SBIR  Phase  II  recipients  have  indi-
cated  in  qualitative  surveys  that  the  commercialization  assistance  programs  and
services  offered  by  DOE’s  SBIR  program  are  valuable  to  their  product  development
and  commercialization  efforts.  Also,  quantitative  data  from  DOE’s  SBIR  Commer-
cialization  Opportunity  Forum  Program,  a  program  that  helps  companies  develop  a
business plan and interact with potential strategic allies and investors, indicate that
more  than  50  percent  of  the  graduates  from  the  program  received  follow-on  invest-
ment within 18 months.
(2)  Make  a  small  fraction  of  the  existing  set-aside  available  for  agency  administra-
tive  purposes.  Appropriate  operating  resources  are  important  to  maintain  and  con-
tinue  to  improve  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs.  The  use  of  a  small  percentage  of
the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs’  funds  for  administrative  purposes  could  improve
their  effectiveness  by  providing  the  resources  for  better  evaluation  of  the  successes
of  participating  small  businesses  and  their  impacts  on  DOE  mission  goals.  For  ex-
ample,  such  resources  would  allow  program  staff  to  improve  Phase  III  follow-up,
track  commercialization  and  non-commercialization  successes,  and  provide  more
outreach  to  increase  small  business  participation.  More  comprehensive,  long-term
data collection would allow better assessment of the results of the programs and en-
able the programs to adjust management practices as appropriate.

A  key  element  in  the  success  of  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  is  the  flexibility
of  the  SBA  Policy  Directive  which  lays  out  the  basic  rules  by  which  each  agency
manages  its  mission  specific  programs.  Each  of  the  federal  agencies  which  partici-
pate in the SBIR/STTR program manages its program through processes that work
best  for  that  agency.  Efforts  to  restrict  this  framework,  which  has  evolved  over  the
24-year  history  of  the  SBIR  Program,  would  be  a  step  backward  and  would  limit
the agencies’ ability to meet the goals of the program.
Award Levels

The SBA is currently considering new award level upper limits for the SBIR pro-
gram to account for inflation. In general, higher award level limits will give agencies
added flexibility in managing their programs and enable support of a broader range
of innovative technology proposals.
Small Business Participation

Over  the  24  years  of  its  existence,  the  DOE  SBIR  Program  has  matured  and
evolved  significantly.  We  have  issued  25  Phase  I  solicitations,  reviewed  approxi-
mately  31,797  proposals,  and  selected  for  funding  4,413  Phase  I  projects  and  1,816
Phase II projects. The SBIR budget for Fiscal Year 2006 was $114 million. The De-
partment  received  1,309  Phase  I  grant  applications  from  809  companies,  of  which
1,021 were sent out for external peer review. We selected 260 applications for Phase
I awards resulting in grants to 173 small businesses in 33 states. Sixty-seven of the
290  grantees  were  first  time  winners  with  DOE.  Thirty-four  of  the  67  were  first
time  applicants  to  DOE.  Thirty-one  applicants  selected  for  funding  were  from  so-

cially  and  economically  disadvantaged  small  businesses  and  thirteen  were  from
small businesses located in a HUBZone (historically underutilized business zone). In
FY  2006,  the  Department  received  226  Phase  II  proposals  and  funded  123  awards
to 96 small businesses. Approximately 95 percent of Phase I awardees submit Phase
II proposals.

Below are additional statistics from prior years:

DOE  actively  participates  in  national,  regional,  and  state  sponsored  outreach  ac-
tivities,  as  do  other  federal  agencies,  to  engage  small  businesses  and  provide  infor-
mation  and  resources  to  better  position  them  to  participate  in  the  SBIR  and  STTR
programs.  These  outreach  activities  generally  consist  of  two-  to  three-day  con-
ferences  featuring  presentations  and  panel  discussions  involving  agency  program
managers and experts in the areas of proposal preparation and budget formulation.
One-on-one  meetings  with  prospective  small  businesses  are  also  provided  to  allow
attendees  to  discuss  their  technology  concepts  and  how  they  might  address  agency
needs. Agency participation in these outreach activities is often limited, however, by
an agency’s limited administrative resources.

The  DOE  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  facilitate  and  participate  in  presentations
and  panel  discussions  at  the  Department’s  annual  Small  Business  Conference.
These conferences typically draw between 400–600 participants each year and have
been  successful  in  attracting  a  significant  number  of  small  and  economically  dis-
advantaged  businesses  that  are  strongly  encouraged  to  consider  SBIR  and  STTR
program opportunities. Continued outreach efforts by the federal agencies’ programs
are  important.  Likewise,  efforts  by  State  Economic  Development  Agencies  have
shown  significant  success  in  helping  their  small  business  communities  pursue  fed-
eral SBIR and STTR funding opportunities.
Financing and Commercialization

Because  the  Department  has  flexibility  to  provide  partial  funding  as  soon  as
Phase  II  awardees  are  selected,  we  are  able  to  minimize  any  gaps  in  financing
under the SBIR and STTR phased award structure. Phase II awardees are typically
selected within a reasonable period following their completion of the Phase I grant.
The  current  SBIR  Policy  Directive  encourages  each  agency  to  develop  a  program
that  reduces  the  time  between  issuance  of  SBIR  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  awards  and
provides the agency flexibility for optimal implementation.

As stated earlier, increasing the amount of the existing set-aside allowed for tech-
nical  assistance,  including  commercialization  assistance  activities,  could  potentially
improve the commercialization success of SBIR R&D supported by the federal agen-

cies.  The  Commercialization  Opportunity  Forum  Program  in  which  DOE  SBIR
grantees  are  invited  to  participate  brings  small  businesses  with  promising  tech-
nologies  face-to-face  with  potential  investors.  This  program,  conducted  by  a  private
organization  competitively  selected  and  under  contract  with  DOE,  provides  small
businesses  the  opportunity  to  work  with  professionals  first  to  develop  and  refine  a
business  plan  and  business  plan  presentation.  Then  small  businesses  are  brought
together  with  decision-makers  from  appropriate  partnering  and  funding  sources  in
a  two-day  forum  that  includes  both  formal  presentations  and  informal  networking
opportunities.  While  every  small  business  supported  by  the  DOE  SBIR  program
theoretically has access to commercialization assistance services, in fact, because of
resource  limitations,  not  every  small  business  is  able  to  participate  in  the  Oppor-
tunity Forum, which involves direct contact with private equity firms. Additional re-
sources  for  commercialization  assistance  through  programs  like  the  Opportunity
Forum  could  help  more  participating  small  businesses  develop  business  plans  for
their  technologies  and  access  the  private  equity  and  investment  markets  essential
to successful commercialization.
Multiple Venture Capital Majority Ownership

The  Department  recognizes  the  positive  impact  that  opening  up  competition  to
multiple  venture  capital  (VC)  majority-owned  small  businesses  may  have  on  stimu-
lating technology development, increasing private sector commercialization from fed-
eral R&D, and meeting agency mission needs. DOE has concerns, however, with re-
spect to how opening up the competition to multiple VC majority-owned small busi-
nesses may impact the participation of small businesses which lack the financial re-
sources  of  multiple  VC  majority-owned  companies.  Because  DOE  provides  financial
assistance in the form of Phase I and Phase II research grants to the successful ap-
plicant,  there  is  no  financial  risk  to  the  company  if  the  research  and  development
of  a  proposed  technology  does  not  result  in  a  commercial  product  in  the  near-term.
The financial risk to these companies comes in Phase III, once the SBIR and STTR
programs’  funding  is  no  longer  provided  and  small  businesses  must  pursue  outside
financial resources for further development and commercialization.

Opening  up  competition  to  multiple  VC-majority  owned  companies  may  have  the
effect  of  squeezing  out  new  technology  start-up  businesses  that  have  been  the  suc-
cess stories of the SBIR and STTR programs and may limit the ability of the federal
program  to  increase  the  participation  of  small  businesses  in  federal  R&D,  particu-
larly participation by socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. In-
terested  venture  capital  companies  have  sufficient  opportunity  to  provide  financial
support  to  the  small  businesses  directly  through  equity  ownership  once  the  tech-
nology has proven itself in Phase II. SBA is currently addressing this issue through
its  public  rule-making  process.  SBA  has  issued  an  Advance  Notice  of  Public  Rule
Making  and  is  reviewing  the  pros  and  cons  of  a  possible  change  in  eligibility  re-
quirements.
Raising the Set-Aside Percentage

Since  its  inception,  the  Department  has  invested  almost  $1.5  billion  in  SBIR/
STTR  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  grants.  In  return,  approximately  60  percent  of  Phase
II-supported  companies  have  earned  a  total  of  more  than  $1.6  billion  in  sales  and
$1.3 billion in additional Phase III development funding—67 percent of which came
from  non-federal  sources—helping  the  Nation  capitalize  on  its  substantial  R&D  in-
vestment.

As  the  Committee  considers  SBIR  Reauthorization,  the  issue  of  raising  the  set-
aside percentage is likely to be a subject of debate. The Department of Energy works
hard  to  maintain  a  strong  and  appropriately  balanced  core  research  program
through  R&D  supported  at  universities,  the  DOE  national  laboratories,  and  U.S.
small  businesses.  The  Department  believes  the  current  set-aside  is  adequate.  At  a
time  when  budgets  are  particularly  constrained,  we  do  not  advocate  increasing  the
set-aside  for  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs.  We  are  most  concerned  that  such  an
increase would negatively impact other areas of the Department’s research portfolio,
including  maintaining  core  research  funding  at  universities.  The  Department  rec-
ommends  that,  before  any  increase  in  the  set-aside  percentage  is  considered,  im-
provements  in  program  efficiency  and  effectiveness  be  explored—for  example,
through  change  to  the  allocation  of  existing  set-aside  resources  to  allow  additional
support  for  technical  assistance  and  commercialization  assistance,  as  well  as  for
agency administrative expenses. Such changes may better position small businesses
to  develop  and  commercialize  their  technologies  and  maximize  their  contribution  to
agency  mission  needs  without  compromising  agencies’  broader  mission  commit-
ments.

Conclusion

Again,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  want  to  thank  you  for
the  opportunity  to  provide  this  statement  from  the  Department  of  Energy.  We  are
committed  to  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  which  have  proved  their  value  over
many years, and we look forward to working with this committee and others on re-
authorization  to  continue  and  further  improve  their  efficacy  for  the  agencies  which
support them and the businesses which emerge and grow from them.

STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS A. COMSTOCK

DIRECTOR, INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM OFFICE

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  submit  a  statement  for  the  record  to  discuss  NASA’s  Small  Business  Innovation
Research (SBIR) Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Pro-
gram.  The  SBIR/STTR  programs  are  managed  by  the  Innovation  Partnerships  Pro-
gram  Office  (IPPO)  whose  primary  mission  is  to  provide  leveraged  technology  and
capabilities  to  NASA  programs  and  projects  through  partnerships  with  industry,
academia, government agencies, and national laboratories.

The SBIR/STTR programs provide an opportunity for small, high technology com-
panies  and  research  institutions  to  participate  in  government  sponsored  research
and  development  efforts  on  key  technology  needs.  Below,  I  have  addressed  the  six
issues  posed  by  this  Subcommittee:  program  effectiveness,  award  level,  small  busi-
ness participation, financing and commercialization, administrative cost and venture
capital.
Program Effectiveness

Many  technologies  funded  by  SBIR/STTR  have  made  important  contributions  to
NASA  programs  and  projects,  and  many  have  also  been  commercial  successes  that
are  bringing  important  benefits  to  society.  The  agency  is  actively  working  to  in-
crease  the  number  of  NASA-funded  SBIR/STTR  technologies  with  applicability  and
adequate maturity for use in NASA’s missions and projects.

Some  examples  of  SBIR/STTR  technologies  that  are  making  important  contribu-

tions to some of NASA’s programs and projects are provided below:

• NASA’s  Mars  Exploration  Rovers  are  using  SBIR  technologies  including  lith-
ium  ion  batteries  from  Yardney  Technical  Products  of  Pawtucket,  Con-
necticut,  heat  switches  from  Starsys  Research  of  Boulder,  Colorado,  and
ASCII chips from Maxwell Technologies of San Diego, California.
• Space  Shuttle  return-to-flight  after  the  Columbia  accident  used  SBIR-devel-
oped wireless sensors from Invocon of Cunroe, Texas, for the impact detection
system  in  the  wing  leading  edge  of  the  Shuttle.  These  wireless  sensors  are
also  used  for  vehicle  health  monitoring  and  microgravity  instrumentation  on
the International Space Station.
• The  Cassini-Huygens  Mission  now  at  Saturn  used  several  SBIR  technologies
including  a  helium  magnetometer  from  Polatomic  of  Richardson,  Texas,  a
coilable  boom  to  deploy  the  magnetometer  from  AEC–Able  of  Goleta,  Cali-
fornia, and filters for several instruments on the spacecraft from Barr Associ-
ates of Westford, Massachusetts.
• The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  is  using  a  miniature,  high  speed,  vibration  free
• The  heat  shield  on  the  return  capsule  for  the  Stardust  mission—first  ever
sample  return  from  a  comet,  and  fastest  ever  Earth  entry  at  12.9  Km/sec—
was  enabled  by  an  SBIR  with  Fiber  Materials  Incorporated  (FMI)  of
Biddleford,  Maine.  FMI  scaled  up  the  heat  shield  fabrication  technology  for
Phenolic  Impregnated  Carbon  Ablator  (PICA)  from  ∼0.1m  maximum  size  at
the time, to the ∼1.0m size needed for Stardust.

turbo-alternator from Creare of Hanover, New Hampshire.

A  few  examples  of  successful  commercialization  of  SBIR/STTR  technologies  are
provided below, and from the breadth of examples it is evident that SBIR/STTR pro-
gram technologies have potential application in every key industrial sector:

• An  STTR  contract  from  NASA’s  Langley  Research  Center  led  to  application
of  ultra-precise  GPS  for  tractor-steering  systems.  Developed  by  Novariant
Corporation  of  Menlo  Park,  California,  these  systems  are  in  use  around  the
world increasing crop yields, reducing chemical use and conserving irrigation
water.
• Weston Solutions of West Chester, Pennsylvania, is using a technology devel-
oped through NASA STTR funding to clean up high concentrations of harmful
chlorinated  solvents  from  dye  and  paint  manufacturers,  dry  cleaners,  chem-
ical  manufacturers,  metal  cleaning  and  degreasing  facilities,  pharmaceutical
and aerosol manufacturers, and other industries.
• Quantum Devices of Barneveld, Wisconsin, has commercialized light-emitting
diode  (LED)  chips  funded  through  SBIR  at  NASA’s  Marshall  Space  Flight
Center.  Initially  used  to  grow  plants  on  the  Space  Shuttle  and  International

Space  Station,  these  lights  are  now  used  for  healing  wounds  and  providing
temporary  relief  from  chronic  pain  due  to  arthritis,  stiffness,  and  muscle
spasms.
• Triangle  Research  and  Development  Corporation  of  Research  Triangle  Park,
North  Carolina,  has  used  a  robotic  vision  system  and  SBIR  funding  from
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center to develop sophisticated crash test dum-
mies  and  models  being  used  by  automobile  and  component  manufacturers  in
vehicle testing worldwide.
• Mineral  identification  technologies  for  Mars  rovers,  developed  with  SBIR
funding from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has been commercialized by
InPhotonics of Norwood, Massachusetts for use by U.S. law enforcement agen-
cies  and  military  personnel  to  identify  suspicious  liquid  and  solid  substances
through glass and plastic packaging materials.
• Ballistic  Recovery  Systems  of  St.  Paul,  Minnesota,  has  commercialized  a
lightweight parachute developed with SBIR funding from NASA’s Langley Re-
search Center, for emergency use by small airplanes, saving many lives.
• Alcon  Laboratories  of  Fort  Worth,  Texas  has  used  laser  tracking  technology
for  spacecraft  rendezvous  and  docking,  developed  with  SBIR  funds  from
NASA’s  Johnson  Space  Center,  to  commercialize  an  eye-tracking  device  for
LASIK surgery that tracks eye movements at four times the established safe-
ty margin.

Both  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  have  evolved  and  matured  over  time  and
NASA  continues  to  pursue  ways  to  improve  program  efficiency  and  effectiveness.
NASA  is  seeking  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  through  achieving  in-
creased infusion into programs and projects. By increasing the degree of integration
of  SBIR/STTR  investments  into  the  overall  technology  development  portfolio  of
NASA’s  four  Mission  Directorates  (Science,  Aeronautics,  Space  Operations,  and  Ex-
ploration  Systems),  SBIR/STTR  investments  will  address  specific  technology  gaps,
be complementary to other investments, and achieve greater infusion.

Each  of  the  11  agencies  participating  in  the  SBIR  program  implements  the  pro-
gram a little differently, based on their mission objectives. Flexibility in the admin-
istration of the program—not using a ‘‘one size fits all’’ approach—has been critical
to  its  success.  The  ability  for  each  agency  to  adjust  funding  levels,  define  areas  of
research  or  subtopics  of  priority,  pursue  opportunities  for  cost  sharing,  have  all
greatly  enhanced  the  ability  to  accelerate  projects  that  have  potential  for  infusion
into  agency  Mission  programs  and/or  commercialization.  Flexibility  does  contribute
to program effectiveness by allowing agencies to tailor to their specific needs.
Appropriate Program Award Levels

Adjusting  the  maximum  award  levels  for  phase  1  and  2  to  account  for  inflation
would  be  desirable,  if  agencies  retained  the  flexibility  to  adjust  awards  as  appro-
priate within those bounds. While higher awards would result in fewer awards, the
advances  achieved  by  those  awardees  would  be  greater  given  the  increased  level  of
funding. A key obstacle for achieving infusion or commercialization success is devel-
oping  technologies  of  sufficient  maturity  or  ‘‘technology  readiness  level’’  in  NASA
jargon. Higher award levels would help increase the maturity of technologies result-
ing from the SBIR/STTR investments, thus reducing the risk of incorporating those
technologies into missions and increasing the likelihood of infusion.
Small Business Participation

Participation in NASA’s SBIR/STTR programs has continued to be more than sat-
isfactory. NASA continues to host a population on average of proposal submits that
range between 1,700 and 2,200 proposals annually. NASA’s outreach efforts at con-
ferences  and  workshops  continue  to  focus  on  increasing  participation  by  the  small
business community. NASA continues to see a flow of firms new to the NASA SBIR
program each year and NASA’s SBIR program is working closely with NASA’s Office
of Small Business Programs (OSBP) to more effectively reach socially and economi-
cally-disadvantaged  and  women-owned  small  businesses.  Achieving  higher  infusion
into programs and projects, a key objective of NASA’s SBIR/STTR program, will re-
sult in increased Phase III funding for small businesses.
Financing and Commercialization

NASA  is  pursuing  several  program  improvements  targeted  at  enhancing  tech-
nology  infusion  into  NASA  programs,  as  well  as  commercialization  assistance  spe-
cific  to  the  companies’  individual  needs.  NASA  has  recently  consolidated  its  SBIR/
STTR program structure to reduce administrative overhead and to focus more clear-
ly  on  the  infusion  of  SBIR/STTR  technologies  into  the  agency  mission  programs.

119

Providing  commercialization  assistance  as  an  integral  part  of  SBIR/STTR  awards
could be beneficial, particularly if the award levels were increased, as business acu-
men  is  not  always  present  in  technological  innovators.  Existing  Phase  III  SBIR/
STTR  authorities  allow  access  to  SBIR/STTR  firms  for  continued  technology  devel-
opment  work  with  non-SBIR  program  funding  on  a  sole-source  basis,  without  the
need  for  a  ‘justification  for  other  than  full  and  open  competition’  or  JOFOC.  This
authority has been beneficial and NASA is seeking to make fuller use of this author-
ity.  It  provides  incentives  for  NASA’s  development  programs  and  their  prime  con-
tractors  to  continue  funding  SBIR  technologies,  and  has  great  potential  to  increase
the  infusion  of  SBIR/STTR  technologies  into  NASA  programs  and  projects,  and  to
increase the amount of federal procurement funding going to SBIR/STTR firms.
Administrative Costs

Administrative  cost  continues  to  be  a  challenge  in  the  SBIR/STTR  programs.  In
October  2006,  NASA  initiated  a  new  consolidated  structure  for  the  NASA’s  SBIR/
STTR  programs.  The  new  program  structure  seeks  to  reduce  program  administra-
tive cost, increase operational efficiency, and supports an additional set of objectives
focused  on  technology  infusion  of  SBIR/STTR  developed  results  into  Mission  Direc-
torate programs, while leveraging more of their resources for administrative support
in  the  program.  Allowing  agencies  to  use  a  portion  of  SBIR/STTR  program  funds
to support administrative costs would give agencies more flexibility.
Venture Capital Majority Ownership

The  objective  of  SBIR/STTR  is  to  support  small  businesses  that  are  contributing
to  agency  missions  and  the  Nation’s  economy.  The  willingness  of  venture  capital
firms  to  invest  in  a  small  business  is  a  positive  indicator  that  people  who  are  put-
ting  their  money  at  risk  believe  in  the  success  of  a  company.  Thus,  some  venture
capital participation might be a good indicator of the likelihood of a small business’s
future  success.  Venture  capital  companies,  and  other  commercial  partners,  are  en-
couraged to invest in SBIR awardees and may own up to 49 percent of an awardee
firm’s equity, so long as they do not have the power to control the firm.

However,  because  a  lack  of  access  to  capital  is  one  of  the  defining  characteristics
of  small  business,  a  majority  ownership  by  venture  capital  organizations  may  indi-
cate  that  business  is  no  longer  appropriately  labeled  small  and  its  participation  in
the  SBIR/STTR  program  needs  to  be  reviewed  by  the  Small  Business  Administra-
tion (SBA) to ensure that its participation continues to meet the intent of the SBIR/
STTR  legislation.  In  addition,  we  have  to  ask  whether  funds  provided  by  venture
capital  firms  might  merely  be  a  substitute  for  set-aside  SBIR  funds  that  might  be
more  productively  used  for  projects  with  no  venture  capital  participation.  SBA  has
issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule-making (ANPRM) and is addressing this
issue through its public rule-making process.

In  closing,  NASA  supports  the  SBIR/STTR  programs.  Technological  innovation  is
vital  to  the  performance  of  NASA’s  Mission  and  the  Nation’s  prosperity  and  secu-
rity.

STATEMENT OF THE

COOPERATIVE STATE RESEARCH EDUCATION

AND EXTENSION SERVICE

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

We appreciate this opportunity to submit this statement to the Committee regard-
ing  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Program  administered  by  CSREES  on
behalf  of  all  USDA  agencies.  The  mission  of  the  Cooperative  State  Research,  Edu-
cation  and  Extension  Service  (CSREES)  at  the  United  States  Department  of  Agri-
culture  (USDA)  is  to  advance  knowledge  for  agriculture,  the  environment,  human
health  and  well-being,  and  communities  through  national  program  leadership  and
federal assistance. In this statement we will provide an overview of the USDA–SBIR
program and attempt to answer the specific questions posed by the Committee.

Within USDA, the staff functions necessary to administer the SBIR program have
been centralized in CSREES in order to provide the SBIR community effective, effi-
cient  and  consistent  service.  These  staff  functions  include  solicitation,  review  and
evaluation  of  proposals,  award  administration  and  post-award  management.
CSREES has well refined systems and procedures for administering grant programs
due to a long history of managing extramural research grants. USDA and CSREES
are very proud of this program that has supported over 1,600 research and develop-
ment  projects  since  its  inception  in  1982,  allowing  hundreds  of  small  businesses  to
pursue innovative ideas and explore their technological potential.

Overall  there  are  eight  USDA  agencies  with  research  and  development  budgets
that set aside 2.5 percent of their extramural research and development awards for
the SBIR program. These agencies are Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Animal
and  Plant  Health  Inspection  Service  (APHIS),  Cooperative  State  Research,  Edu-
cation  and  Extension  Service  (CSREES),  Economic  Research  Service  (ERS),  Forest
Service  (FS),  National  Agricultural  Statistics  Service  (NASS),  Rural  Development
(RD), and Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). In fiscal year 2006 these agencies con-
tributed  over  $19.5  million  to  SBIR.  Of  the  total  USDA  funding,  approximately  82
percent is contributed by CSREES, about 12 percent is contributed by ARS and ap-
proximately three percent is contributed by the Forest Service.

The USDA–SBIR program administered by CSREES has two types of awards. The
first  is  for  Phase  I  feasibility  studies  that  can  be  up  to  $80,000  for  eight  months
and  the  second  is  for  Phase  II  research  and  development  grants  that  can  be  up  to
$350,000  for  24  months.  Approximately  90  Phase  I  feasibility  grants  and  35–40
Phase II research and development grants are awarded annually. Successful comple-
tion of a Phase I study is prerequisite to receipt of a Phase II grant. Of the applica-
tions  received,  15  to  17  percent  of  the  Phase  I  and  50  to  60  percent  of  the  Phase
II proposals have been funded each year.

An important aspect of the SBIR program is post-award management. Most of the
effort  is  directed  toward  Phase  II  projects  that  have  demonstrated  technical  feasi-
bility  in  Phase  I  and  are  continuing  their  research  and  development.  A  commer-
cialization  assistance  program  is  offered  to  new  Phase  II  winners  so  that  grantees
can work with a contractor who helps identify potential commercialization partners,
markets or new business opportunities. In addition, the USDA’s SBIR National Pro-
gram  Leaders  conduct  occasional  site  visits  and  work  closely  with  all  of  the  Phase
II projects to provide advice and guidance. Since successful commercialization often
takes  several  years,  the  USDA  SBIR  program  maintains  contact  with  past  Phase
II  winners  for  many  years  in  an  effort  to  document  those  projects  which  achieve
commercial success.
Program Effectiveness

The Committee has asked whether the SBIR program is meeting its objectives to
stimulate  and  commercialize  innovation  in  support  of  agency  missions  through  ex-
panded  small  business  participation  in  extramural  federal  R&D  and  how  program
efficiency and effectiveness could be improved.

The USDA–SBIR program has effectively supported innovative R&D projects that
have  led  to  commercialization  of  important  new  technologies  that  have  benefited
many  aspects  of  American  agriculture  and  rural  development.  However,  SBIR  pro-
gram  managers  believe  they  could  encourage  more  participation  by  small  business
firms  by  increasing  awareness  of  the  SBIR  opportunities  through  attendance  at
State and regional meetings. Program managers also believe site visits would allow
them to work with current grantees and help them more rapidly achieve commercial
success.  Therefore  we  recommend  allowing  a  small  percentage  of  SBIR  program
funds be made available for these activities.

Award Levels

The  Committee  has  asked  what  the  appropriate  award  levels  are  in  light  of  typ-
ical  project  costs  to  support  agency  missions,  the  trends  in  seed  and  early  stage  fi-
nancing  and  the  fact  that  there  has  not  been  an  inflationary  adjustment  in  award
levels since 1992.

Given  the  size  of  the  USDA–SBIR  budget,  current  award  levels  are  sufficient  to
meet  our  needs.  USDA  would  have  no  objection  if  the  maximum  award  levels  were
increased  beyond  the  current  $100,000  for  Phase  I  and  $700,000  for  Phase  II
awards.  However,  any  such  increase  would  not  directly  affect  our  program  because
we are currently limiting grant levels to $80,000 for Phase I and $350,000 for Phase
II.
Small Business Participation

The Committee has asked how the programs can increase the participation of in-
novative  small  business  in  federal  R&D  including  the  total  number  of  small  busi-
nesses,  their  geographic  distribution,  and  participation  of  minority  and  disadvan-
taged firms.

As noted above, one way to increase small business participation in the SBIR pro-

gram is through more effective outreach efforts.
Financing and Commercialization

The  Committee  has  asked  what  common  program  elements  are  needed  across  all
agencies  to  address  financing  gaps  in  the  Phased  award  structure  to  provide  com-
mercialization assistance.

Different  SBIR  programs  use  different  approaches  to  deal  with  the  funding  gap
between  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  projects.  USDA  allows  companies  to  eliminate  this
funding  gap  through  a  combination  of  a  no-cost  extension  of  the  Phase  I  project  to-
gether  with  pre-award  authorization  on  the  Phase  II  award.  Other  Departments
allow  companies  to  submit  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  proposals  simultaneously.  In  re-
ality,  however,  very  few  companies  choose  to  take  advantage  of  either  of  these  op-
tions.

Regarding  commercialization  assistance,  many  SBIR  programs  offer  commer-
cialization assistance in Phase I and/or Phase II. The dollar limit on this assistance
has been set at $4,000 for over 10 years.
Administrative Costs

The Committee has asked how program administration costs should be addressed
in  reauthorization  in  light  of  the  fact  that  program  costs  are  currently  paid  out  of
non-SBIR funds.

SBIR  programs  are  not  currently  allowed  to  use  any  program  funds  for  adminis-
trative  purposes.  This  has  become  a  serious  problem  for  the  USDA–SBIR  program.
The  administrative  costs  for  the  SBIR  program  have  to  come  from  the  limited  gen-
eral administrative funds within CSREES. We recommend allowing a small percent-
age  of  the  SBIR  program  funds  to  be  used  for  administrative  purposes  to  improve
overall program effectiveness. These purposes should include travel support for out-
reach efforts, support for commercialization assistance and support for the proposal
review process.

As  one  example,  the  USDA  SBIR  program  would  like  to  be  able  to  offer  Phase
II grant awardees a very successful private sector commercialization assistance pro-
gram that costs $12,000 per company. Unfortunately, the lack of adequate adminis-
trative support funds coupled with the commercialization assistance limits precludes
the use of this valuable assistance. Funds to support this program could be available
if administrative costs were allowed.
Conclusion

In closing the SBIR program has been effective and has encouraged business ini-
tiative and innovation in the agricultural sector of our economy. Since its inception,
over  1,600  innovators  and  entrepreneurs  have  received  the  resources  they  needed
to  examine  the  commercial  feasibility  of  their  ideas  and  many  of  these  have  gone
on  to  achieve  some  measure  of  commercial  success.  With  several  relatively  simple
modifications  we  can  improve  on  this  successful  track  record  and  help  even  more
small businesses, which in turn will help expand job opportunities in rural America
and keep America’s agriculture strong.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments.
