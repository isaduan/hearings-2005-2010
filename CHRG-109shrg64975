THE  DIGITAL  TELEVISION  TRANSITION 

TUESDAY,  JULY  12,  2005 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10  a.m.  in  room  SR– 
253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,  Chairman 
of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The CHAIRMAN. Good morning. Thank you all for coming. 
This hearing is going to examine issues relating to setting a hard 
date to complete the DTV transition. We believe a hard date is nec-
essary.  The  issue  has  been  in  the  works  since  1996.  Public  safety 
needs  spectrum  for  interoperability  for  new  services.  Consumers 
need  to  get  better  video  and  audio  services  and  more  over-the-air 
programming. And consumers will also get a new series of services 
recovered  from  the  700  megahertz  spectrum  that  will  be—such  as 
wireless broadband. 

It’s the feeling of this committee that we must balance broadcast 
cable  and  satellite  interests  with  regard  to  digital  and  analog  car-
riage  after  the  analog  broadcasts  cease.  Broadcasters  want  to  en-
sure  that  all  of  their  signals  are  seen  by  as  many  viewers  as  pos-
sible. Cable wants time to proceed with their own digital transition, 
and  doesn’t  want  to  have  to  immediately  deploy  cable  converter 
boxes to all of the analog subscribers. And satellite is worried about 
spectrum  concerns  related  to  high  definition  that  could  force  them 
to  significantly  reduce  the  number  of  local-to-local  markets  that 
they can serve due to capacity restraints. 

So,  we  look  forward  to  receiving  your  testimony.  And  there’s 

going to be some coming and going here today, I’m sure. 

Senator McCain, do you want to go first, please? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you  for 

holding this hearing. 

I believe that retrieving the analog spectrum and completing the 
digital  television  transition  is  the  most  critical  communications 
issue facing the 109th Congress. 

For  over  20  years,  regulators  in  Washington  have  been  debating 
the  transition  to  digital  television.  It  was  during  the  1980s  that 
broadcasters  first  brought  forth  policy  proposals  on  high-definition

television.  Some  believe  that  broadcasters  sought  the  transition, 
not  to  provide  clearer  pictures  and  better  sound  to  their  viewers, 
but, rather, to prevent competition from the new broadcast stations 
and wireless carriers that the FCC had considered licensing on un-
used channels. 

According to one observer, Tom Hazlett, the history of DTV reads 
like  a  Russian  novel.  It  was  born  not  in  the  laboratory,  but  on  K 
Street,  an  attempt  by  broadcasting  lobbyists  to  block  land-mobile 
services from gaining access to UHF spectrum, despite pressing de-
mands  for  more  wireless  telephone  competition.  In  an  aggressive 
lobbying  campaign,  Congress  was  to  give  broadcasters  new  spec-
trum  for  digital  broadcasting  for  free.  I  have  often  referred  to  this 
as  the  Great  $70  Billion  Giveaway.  And  according  to  the  Tele-
communications  Act  of  1996,  this  great  taxpayer  rip-off  was  to 
occur  by  December  31,  2006;  thereby,  allowing  the  broadcasters 
over  10  years  to  prepare  viewers  and  stations  for  this  new  age  of 
television.  However,  shortly  thereafter,  broadcasters  changed  their 
mind  and  persuaded  Congress,  in  1997,  the  Balanced  Budget  Act, 
to  provide  an  exception  to  the  December  31,  2006,  date  by  requir-
ing communities to meet an 85 percent penetration test before ana-
log broadcasting could end. 

Last  year,  at  a  Commerce  Committee  hearing,  then-FCC  Chair-
man  Michael  Powell  testified  that  this  85  percent  penetration  test 
could  result  in  the  DTV  transition  being  put  off  for  decades,  or 
multiple decades. 

I  remind  my  colleagues  that  it  took  color  television  20  years  to 
hit 85 percent penetration, and VCRs 16 years to reach that pene-
tration.  The  problem  is,  we  don’t  have  another  20  years  to  wait. 
The  spectrum  controlled  by  television  broadcasters  is  essential  to 
providing  our  police,  fire,  and  other  emergency-response  personnel 
the necessary tools to communicate with each other in the event of 
another—national emergency. 

The  use  of  this  spectrum  for  public  safety  communications  was 
one  of  the  key  recommendations  of  the  9/11  Commission,  still  at-
tempting to be blocked by the National Association of Broadcasters. 
The  bombings  last  week  in  London  reinforced  the  immediate  need 
for  the  spectrum.  CNN  reported  that  members  of  Scotland  Yard 
were  unable  to  communicate  during  their  response  to  the  bomb-
ings, because they lacked sufficient spectrum. Scotland Yard had to 
borrow  spectrum  from  a  wireless  carrier,  Vodafone;  thereby,  pre-
venting  millions  of  callers  from  reaching  loved  ones  on  their  cell 
phones to share news of their safety. 

We  can  act  now  to  prevent  a  similar  problem  in  the  United 
States. Our Nation can’t wait any longer. Last month, I introduced 
S.  1268,  the  Spectrum  Availability  for  Emergency  Response  and 
Law  Enforcement  to  Improve  Vital  Emergency  Services  Act,  which 
would  provide  our  Nation’s  first  responders  with  additional  spec-
trum  by  January  1,  2009.  I  wish  the  date  could  have  been  sooner, 
but,  after  talking  to  public  safety  organizations  and  broadcasters, 
I thought, and decided, that December 31, 2008, presents the most 
reasonable  deadline.  I  introduced  this  bill,  Mr.  Chairman,  because 
I  promised  police,  firefighters,  and  other  emergency-response  per-
sonnel I would continue the fight on their behalf.

I’m proud that Chairman Stevens has announced his intention to 
provide  the  spectrum  to  public  safety  organizations  by  January  1, 
2009. I hope that others will join in ensuring that public safety per-
sonnel  have  the  communications  tool  necessary  to  protect  our  Na-
tion. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  don’t  have  to  repeat  again  the  benefits  of  com-
pleting this transition. They’re not only are related to our Nation’s 
public  safety;  the  liberation  of  spectrum  will  unleash  a  multitude 
of  new  commercial  wireless  services,  and  new  opportunities  for 
more broadband deployment and competition. Freeing the spectrum 
would  allow  us  to  rely  more  heavily  on  the  market,  rather  than 
government, to regulate telecommunications. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  hope  that  we  can  act,  and  act  quickly,  on  this 
issue.  If  there  is  another  national  emergency,  the  first  responders 
are unable to communicate with each other. I think one of the most 
disgraceful chapters in the history of this committee, and Congres-
sional oversight, is the way that the National Association of Broad-
casters  has  continued  to  block  this  transition,  and  free  up  this 
transition. If there’s a national emergency before our first respond-
ers get this spectrum, they bear a heavy burden. 

Mr. Chairman, I thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Burns? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator BURNS. I want to reiterate and build off of what Senator 
McCain has said. I think he makes a point. But one thing that we 
have  not  done  in  this  whole  transition  thing  is  to  make  sure  that 
the  market  works,  and  that  consumers  get  what  they  want.  The 
discussion  has  been  about  hard  dates,  mandates,  new  FCC  rules, 
and  the  like.  I  wonder  whether  we  should  be  listening  to  con-
sumers, who are our constituents, a great deal more than we have 
so  far  before  making  any  big  decisions.  But,  at  the  same  time, 
there  is  also  evidently  not  much  awareness  out  there—in  fact,  I 
would say pretty close to none at all—that this is really happening, 
and  that  government  is  getting  ready  to  take  away  analog  spec-
trum;  and  so,  make  literally  millions  of  television  sets  inoperable 
in every home in America. 

So  far,  the  public  education  effort  seems  to  have  been  inad-
equate, to say the least. So, I would hope that we would hear testi-
mony this morning that would give us some indication in which di-
rection  the  market  wants  to  go.  And  our  dedication  to  the  people, 
not  only  that  are  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  broadcasting, 
whether  it  be  cable,  or  dish,  or  over-the-air,  that—where  the  con-
sumers  are.  And  I  think  we  have  to,  in  order—if  we  are  to  fulfill 
our responsibility in promoting diverse information, news, and pub-
lic safety, and also entertainment, then all of them have to be con-
sidered on that basis. 

So,  I  thank  the  panel  for  attending  this  morning.  We  look  for-
ward to your hearing. But, I’ll tell you right now, I’m looking at the 
consumers,  their  cost,  and  whether  the  market  can  make  the  ad-
justment. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Lautenberg?

Senator LAUTENBERG. I would defer to Senator Inouye. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  would  ask  that  my  statement  be  made  a  part 

of the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
I want to thank the Chairman for holding two hearings today on the many issues 
raised  by  the  digital  television  transition.  Over  the  course  of  these  hearings,  I  am 
optimistic that the testimony will not only help us understand these difficult issues, 
but provide us with the tools to address them successfully. 

Not a single stakeholder denies that we need to bring the digital television transi-
tion  to  a  successful  close.  We  all  benefit  by  bringing  consumers  better  quality  tele-
vision service, providing public safety with the spectrum it needs to protect our com-
munities,  and  unleashing  new  and  innovative  wireless  services  using  the  spectrum 
that will be reclaimed. 

Only with a realistic ‘‘hard deadline’’ will we reap these rewards. More important 
that  being  realistic  in  terms  of  timing,  any  legislation  establishing  a  hard  deadline 
must include a plan to ensure that all consumers can transition to digital with rel-
ative  ease.  It  also  must  establish  what  carriage  requirements  should  apply  to  local 
broadcast signals during and after the transition. Finally, it must maximize the ben-
efits to consumers from the return of the analog spectrum. 

To  be  successful,  we  must  address  these  complex  public  policy  issues  head  on.  A 
decision driven purely by budget considerations, rather than good public policy, will 
fail  to  generate  the  benefits  we  all  hope  to  achieve.  Moreover,  if  we  fail  to  tackle 
the  difficult  issues  that  confront  us,  we  will  only  create  an  artificial  and  illusory 
deadline. 

First  and  foremost,  our  efforts  to  bring  the  digital  transition  to  a  close  must  re-
spond  to  challenges  that  consumers  will  face  in  meeting  any  date  certain.  Even 
today,  citizens  all  across  this  country  are  purchasing  analog  sets  with  an  expecta-
tion they would work for the life of the set. They did not ask for a digital television 
transition  and,  in  many  cases,  are  still  unaware  that  the  country  is  in  the  midst 
of a transition. Regardless of the total number of affected television sets, those citi-
zens reliant on over-the-air television signals face the prospect of a total loss of tele-
vision service. The magnitude of this potential disruption demands that we do more 
than simply hope for the best. 

This  transition  will  only  go  smoothly  if  we  help  these  consumers  acquire  the 
equipment  necessary  to  receive  the  digital  signal,  and  this  means  subsidizing  the 
purchase of digital-to-analog converters. If we attempt to end analog television serv-
ice  for  the  cheapest  possible  cost  and  create  a  meager  consumer  subsidy  based  on 
the  study  projecting  the  lowest  number  of  affected  sets,  I  believe  we  are  inviting 
problems. 

If,  instead,  we  create  a  robust  subsidy  program  with  a  comprehensive  consumer 
education and outreach plan, and all affected parties come to the table with innova-
tive  solutions,  the  result  may  well  be  that  the  number  of  affected  consumers  will 
be smaller than projected and the excess funds can be returned to the Treasury. 

We know well that the potential benefits of this transition are substantial, includ-
ing  economic  growth  and  job  opportunities  from  the  new  uses  of  the  returned  spec-
trum. And I am certain that those benefits will be cited repeatedly today in support 
of  a  hard  deadline.  We  will  also  hear  that  the  estimate  from  the  Congressional 
Budget  Office  that  the  auction  of  the  analog  spectrum  will  bring  the  Treasury  $10 
billion is conservative. 

In the current budget climate, we face difficult decisions about how to use our lim-
ited funding resources, but we must not be penny-wise and pound foolish. If we are 
unwilling  to  commit  up-front  the  necessary  funds  and  to  create  the  comprehensive 
education and outreach plan that is required to ensure a smooth transition, we risk 
delaying  unnecessarily  the  economic  and  public  safety  benefits  from  reclaiming  the 
analog spectrum. 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  of  the  witnesses  on 

these complex issues.

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And 
it’s  good  that  we’re  holding  this  hearing,  both  hearings  today,  on 
the transition to digital television. 

Now, we know from our listening sessions in recent months, and 
from  the  diverse  constituencies  that  are  represented  here  today, 
that  this  transition  poses  many  opportunities,  but  also  many  chal-
lenges.  However,  upon  completing  the  DTV  transition,  consumers 
will  enjoy  a  better  television  viewing  experience.  DTV  is  going  to 
provide  viewers  with  sharper  pictures,  wider  screens,  CD-quality 
sound, and better color rendition, all distinct advantages. 

Unfortunately, most Americans have little or no awareness about 
the  magnitude  of  this  transition  that’s  about  to  occur.  And,  also, 
they  don’t  really  understand  what  it  is  that  they’re  going  to  get, 
the  benefits  that  will  accompany  this  change.  And  later  on  we’re 
going  to  hear  from  the  public  safety  community,  which  will  be  one 
of the main beneficiaries of the transition. 

The  transition  to  digital  television  will  free  up  valuable  spec-
trum, which will improve the safety of the public, as our Chairman 
announced  this  morning,  through  enhanced  communications  and 
reduced interference for first responders. 

This morning’s hearing is also important because we need broad-
casters,  cable,  satellite,  and  public  television  to  work  together  and 
to make the transition as smooth and as fair as possible. The tran-
sition  will  ultimately  be,  as  I  said,  a  truly  positive  step,  not  just 
in terms of what’s gained by the return of the analog spectrum, but 
also the improvement from digital programming. 

And I take the public-interest obligation of our broadcasters very 
seriously. I know that our Nation’s public television stations strive 
to  offer  innovative,  educational,  and  community  programs.  And 
there  are  many  examples  of  that  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey. 
WNJN, the New Jersey Network, was already using its digital sig-
nal to transmit job-training data last year. And I want to hear from 
those  on  the  panel  about  other  ways  that  DTV  transition  can  en-
hance  local  content,  and  increase  civic  and  educational  program-
ming. 

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I  think  you’ve  handled  this  extremely 
well, in terms of the listening sessions, in terms of having all of the 
voices that really have something constructive to say about how we 
get—where we go and how we get there. So, I look forward to hear-
ing  from  all  sides  as  we  review  the  best  approach  to  the  looming 
DTV transition. It can’t be a spectators’ game, as far as we’re con-
cerned.  We  have  to  encourage  the  pace  and  the  quality  of  the 
change, and the cost. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.

I  would  like  to  just  thank  you  for  holding  this  very  important 
hearing. I know there are a lot of different interests that we’ll hear 
from in this panel, and one later on, from broadcasters, to cable op-
erators, to electronics producers. 

For  me,  this  is  a  quality-of-life  issue  for  the  public.  We’ve  got 
issues here related to improving education, homeland security, and, 
I think, in a large way, American competitiveness. I think it’s time 
to get on with this transition. I think the taxpayers have paid dear-
ly for this transition to occur. 

I’m looking forward to hearing from all of the panelists today on 
how  we  can  make  this  happen,  as  soon  as  possible,  in  a  way  that 
would  be  least  disruptive  to  those  in  the  industry,  but  the  most 
beneficial for our consumers and taxpayers. 
So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
[The prepared statement of Senator DeMint follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 
Good afternoon. Thank you, Chairmen Stevens and Inouye for holding this second 
DTV hearing of the day, this one focusing on the spectrum issues and public safety 
aspects to digital television transition. 

The  lesson  of  the  9/11  attacks  was  clear.  Public  Safety  needs  interoperable  com-
munications.  Providing  public  safety  with  the  needed  spectrum  will  be  the  start  of 
that. 

Unfortunately,  public  safety  cannot  start  until  the  digital  transition  in  complete 

and the broadcasters vacate the analog spectrum. 

One of the short-term risks we face in cutting off the analog broadcasts is the reli-
ance on free-over-the-air television in the event of a natural disaster. This is of par-
ticular concern to me as a Senator from a coastal state. I would like to see the var-
ious  facets  of  the  telecom  industry  meet  the  demand  for  emergency  information, 
much like the Amber Alert system. I think this would go a long way to saving lives 
in all kinds of emergencies. 

I thank the witnesses for coming here this afternoon to share their expertise and 
recommendations with us on how best to achieve this goal as quickly and efficiently 
as possible. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. 
Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
This  is  something  that  we  very  much  need  to  get  done.  And 
maybe the good news is that everyone who steps up to this debate 
suggests  that  this  is  important,  this  is  a  transition  we’re  all  com-
mitted  to.  I  think  there’s  general  consensus  that  we  need  to  set  a 
date  for  the  transition.  But,  unfortunately,  that  seems  to  be  about 
where the agreement ends. 

We  will  not  get  this  done,  and  we  will  not—certainly  not  get  it 
done successfully—unless we’re willing to make some difficult deci-
sions,  unless  we’re  willing  to  show  some  leadership  on  this  issue, 
and unless we’re willing, frankly, to set aside a lot of the competing 
interests  here  and  really  focus  on  what  makes  the  most  sense  for 
our public-spectrum policy, and what makes the most sense for the 
consumers. 

If  we  want  to  complete  the  digital  conversion,  then  we  need  to 
set  a  date  and  work  to  make  sure  that  that  date  that’s  set  is  suc-
cessful in its implementation. If we don’t want to make this transi-

tion, if we don’t actually want to complete this, then I think people 
that have a vested interest in slowing down or opposing the process 
should  be  honest  and  step  forward  and  say,  ‘‘You  know,  we’re  not 
for  this.  We  actually  don’t  want  to  go  ahead  into  an  all-digital 
world,  because  we  think  it  will  hurt  our  business  model,’’  or,  ‘‘We 
think  we’ll  lose  money,’’  or,  ‘‘We  don’t  want  to  return  the  spec-
trum.’’ Whatever your issue may be, you need to put it on the table 
and be honest about it. 

When  we  go  to  a  fully  digital  world,  there  are  some  television 
sets manufactured in the 1970s, and the 1980s, and the 1990s, and 
even  a  few  in  the  2000  era,  that  will  not  directly  receive  digital 
transmissions.  We  need  to  deal  with  that.  We  will  deal  with  that. 
But  one  thing  we  should  not  have  in  this  debate  is  interests 
using  consumers  as  a  scapegoat,  as  a  boogeyman,  in  order  to  fur-
ther  their  own  interests.  I  think  that’s  something  that  we  need  to 
avoid.  It’s  been  done  across  the  board.  Congress  is  doing  this  be-
cause we believe a digital system is in the consumer’s interest and 
in  the  public  interest.  And  I  think  the  consumers  will  be  well 
served.  I  think  it’s  shortsighted  at  best,  disingenuous  at  worst,  to 
argue a position that consumers aren’t intelligent enough to handle 
this transition. That’s essentially what we’re getting from some in-
terests—again, across the spectrum. 

The  broadcasters  argue  that  the  consumers  won’t  be  well  served 
and  consumers  won’t  be  able  to  handle  this  transition,  in  order  to 
slow  it  down  or  to  prevent  certain  frequencies  from  going  to  the 
public-safety  interest.  The  cable  operators  argue  that  they  need 
down-conversion;  otherwise,  consumers  will  be  confused,  and  they 
won’t be able to get their MTV or whatever other program it is that 
they’re  used  to  or  expecting.  The  public  interest  and  consumer 
groups argue that consumers will be confused unless we have large 
government  subsidies  and  new  government  mandates.  Everyone  is 
using the specter of consumer confusion to further their own inter-
est.  And  I  think—well,  I  think  it  does  the  American  public  a  dis-
service to suggest that they can’t handle this transition. 

When  we  set  a  date,  we  will—and,  I  think,  we  must,  set  a  firm 
date—we’re  going  to  have  subsidies  for  the  conversion,  of  some 
sort.  I  think  we  all  recognize  that.  We  shouldn’t  make  it  a  cum-
bersome program. We should target that subsidy, to the extent that 
it’s needed. But we will have a mechanism in place for this. 

We will have to tackle two new mandates; so the number of TVs 
that  are  sold  that  will  not  be  able  to  receive  digital  TVs  directly 
will continue to shrink. I hope, and I believe, that the providers of 
subscription services, whether it’s cable or satellite, will argue that 
their  number  of  consumers  will  increase,  and  that  will  also  mini-
mize  the  dislocation  and  the  difficulty  of  consumers.  There  are  a 
lot of things that will be put in place in this legislation to minimize 
the  difficulties  of  consumers  when  the  transition  takes  place.  But, 
for  those  consumers  that  might  need  to  go  out  and  buy  an  $80  or 
$100,  or  even  a  $200,  converter  box,  I  don’t  think  it  will  cause  a 
national  crisis,  when  and  if  we  reach  that  day,  when  there  is  a 
small  percentage  that  are  in  that  position.  To  suggest  that  there 
will  be  some  national  crisis,  in  order  to  defend  your  political  or  fi-
nancial interests, I don’t think serves the crafting of this legislation 
very well.

I  hope  that  those  are  principles  or  concerns  that  color  this  de-
bate,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  hope  that  members  of  this  committee  show 
a  little  bit  more  leadership  on  this  issue  than,  perhaps,  we’ve  had 
in  the  past,  because  that’s  going  to  absolutely  be  required  if  we’re 
going to get any legislation done. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
All  statements  of  the  Senators,  opening  statements,  will  be 

placed in the record as though read. 

My  intention  is  to  ask  each  of  the  witnesses  at  the  table  now  to 
present their comments, not more than 5 minutes, if you will. And 
we  will  print  all  of  your  statements  in  the  record  completely,  also. 
And then we’ll have a series of questions from our committee. 

So, because of no reason, other than you’re over there, Mr. Fritts, 

we’ll call on you first. 

STATEMENT OF EDWARD O. FRITTS, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS (NAB) 

Mr. FRITTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Co-Chairman Inouye, 

and members of the Committee. 

In  1996,  local  television  broadcasters  and  Congress  entered  into 
a public/private partnership to bring the future of television to the 
American  consumer.  When  we  undertook  this  endeavor,  Congress 
was  seeking  to  promote  a  number  of  goals.  Key  among  them  was 
ensuring  that  America’s  system  of  broadcasting  remains  the  most 
technologically-advanced source of news, local information, and en-
tertainment. 

Local  television  is  as  vital  a  part  of  America’s  way  of  life  today 
as  it  was  when  we  started  the  journey,  back  in  1996.  This  past 
weekend,  with  the  Florida  hurricane,  local  Florida  television  sta-
tions  kept  the  public  informed,  calm,  and  safe.  Yesterday,  the 
President  of  the  American  Red  Cross  commented  on  our  stations, 
and I quote, ‘‘Time and again, Americans rely on local broadcasters 
to  provide  critical  information  that  saves  lives  and  offers  hope  in 
times  of  need,’’  unquote.  It’s  valuable  services  like  these  that  will 
be  strengthened  and  enhanced  when  the  digital  television  transi-
tion is successfully completed. 

Broadcasters  accept—let  me  underscore—broadcasters  accept 
that  Congress  will  implement  a  2009  hard  date  for  the  end  of  the 
analog broadcasts. And we’re ready. We’ve done our part. We’ve in-
vested  billions  to  put  up  more  than  1,500  local  digital  stations  on 
the air, right now. 

As Congress and the affected parties work to end this transition, 
one  stakeholder  must  be  central,  and  that’s  the  consumers.  This 
committee  and  Congress  should  ensure  that  consumers—our  view-
ers,  your  constituents—can  enjoy  the  benefits  of  a  fully  developed, 
free,  local  digital  television  system.  For  instance,  after  the  transi-
tion in 2009, if you’re a cable subscriber with both analog and dig-
ital  sets  in  your  home,  you’ll  want  the  analog  sets  to  work  in  ana-
log, and you’ll want your digital sets to work in digital. Consumers 
should be empowered to make that choice about which signal to re-
ceive, not the cable gatekeeper. 

Consumer  interest  should  also  drive  the  debate  in  the  area  of 
full-signal  carriage.  Today,  some  585  television  stations  across  the

country  are  using  DTV  to  split  their  signal  into  multiple  program-
ming  streams.  This  practice,  called  multicasting,  holds  one  of  the 
great  promises  of  the  digital  transition;  namely,  more  free  local 
programming options for the public. 

What’s  taking  place  in  the  market  right  now?  An  example: 
WDBJ,  in  Roanoke,  Virginia,  broadcasts  CBS  programming  in 
HDTV;  and,  through  multicasting,  the  station  also  offers  a  pro-
gramming  feed  with  extended  coverage  of  breaking  news,  ACC 
sports,  and  Virginia  Tech  football  games.  And  dozens  of  market 
stations are multicasting to supply network programming that was 
previously  not  there.  For  example,  in  Tallahassee,  CBS  affiliate 
WCTV  uses  multicasting  to  also  supply  the  UPN  Network  to  pro-
gramming viewers. 

Multicasting  means  greater  opportunities  to  serve  diverse  demo-
graphics.  Ninety  stations  nationwide  are  multicasting  in  foreign- 
language programming. The languages range widely from German, 
to  Korean,  to  Spanish,  to  Vietnamese.  And  most  important  from 
the  consumer  standpoint,  these  services  are  free.  Regrettably,  in 
many cases cable operators refuse to provide these services to their 
subscribers.  If  the  cable  monopolies  strip  these  free  services  from 
broadcaster  signals,  it  will  be  difficult  for  stations  to  fully  develop 
multicasting. 

The history of the television industry offers some lessons here. It 
was  only  after  Congress  passed  the  1992  Cable  Act,  that  guaran-
teed  cable  carriage,  that  networks  like  FOX,  UPN,  the  WB, 
Telemundo,  and  Univision  fully  matured.  Likewise,  cable  carriage 
would be necessary for new multicasting programming to bloom. 

Let’s  be  clear,  the  multicast  issue  is  not  about  capacity.  Regard-
less of whether they multicast or do a single stream of HDTV pro-
gramming,  a  broadcaster’s  digital  signal  takes  up  no  more  band-
width  on  the  cable  system.  In  fact,  with  new  compression  tech-
nologies, whether a station multicasts or not, they will occupy one- 
half  of  the  cable  bandwidth  they  took  up  in  the  analog  world.  The 
cable system will get back the rest. 

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  move  to  DTV  has  always  been,  first  and 
foremost,  about  consumers—your  constituents  and  our  viewers. 
America’s  local  broadcasters  share  your  goal  of  successfully  com-
pleting this DTV transition. We are here to work with you in mov-
ing this legislation that will complete this transition; that will free 
the  analog  spectrum  for  other  uses,  and,  ultimately,  will  bring  the 
full benefits of the highest digital technology to the American tele-
vision viewer. 

Thank you for the opportunity to participate, and I look forward 

to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD O. FRITTS, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS (NAB) 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Commerce 
Committee  today.  I  am  Edward  O.  Fritts,  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of 
the  National  Association  of  Broadcasters  (NAB).  NAB  is  a  nonprofit,  incorporated 
association  of  radio  and  television  stations,  which  serves  and  represents  the  Amer-
ican broadcasting industry. 

The television broadcast industry as a whole will spend, by the end of the transi-
tion  process,  approximately  10–16  billion  dollars  to  convert  from  analog  technology

to  digital  technology.  Today,  1,508  television  stations  are  broadcasting  digital  sig-
nals, which reach over 99.9 percent of the television households in the country. The 
promise  of  this  technology  for  both  television  broadcasters  and  viewers  is  great. 
Broadcasters will be better able to serve their audiences by offering vastly improved 
picture  quality  including  high  definition  (HD),  more  diverse  program  offerings  on 
multiple streams, and even nonprogram services such as data services. The promise 
of  digital  television  services  for  broadcasters  and  viewers  alike  will  be  curtailed, 
however, and broadcasters’ investment at least partially stranded, if cable operators 
are allowed to exercise unchecked their power to refuse carriage of multiple streams 
of digital broadcast material. 

Accordingly,  my  remarks  today  will  address  the  importance—for  both  the  broad-
cast  industry  and  the  viewing  public—of  cable  carriage  for  local  broadcasters’  full 
digital signals, including their multicast programming streams. Full signal carriage 
will help ensure a vibrant, free over-the-air digital broadcasting system, and the de-
velopment  of  diverse  programming  to  even  better  serve  broadcasters’  local  commu-
nities.  It  will  also  advance  the  digital  transition,  thereby  speeding  the  clearing  of 
spectrum for the provision of vital public safety services. Moreover, the rapid growth 
of  cable  capacity  in  recent  years  has  rendered  negligible  any  burden  that  carriage 
of  broadcasters’  full  digital  signals  (including  any  multicast  programming  streams) 
imposes on cable operators. Particularly in light of this tremendous growth in cable 
capacity, a Congressional requirement that cable operators carry local broadcasters’ 
multicast  programming  streams  offered  free  over-the-air  will  clearly  pass  Constitu-
tional muster. 
Full  Signal  Carriage  Will  Help  Preserve  Our  System  of  Free,  Over-the-Air 

Local Broadcast Television in the Digital Age 

The  Cable  Television  Consumer  Protection  and  Competition  Act  of  1992  (Cable 
Act),  was  based  on  the  premise  that  ‘‘must-carry’’  would  preserve  the  benefits  of 
free,  over-the-air  local  broadcast  television,  particularly  for  those  viewers  who  did 
not subscribe to cable.1 The Supreme Court agreed and recognized that preservation 
of  our  system  of  broadcasting  was  ‘‘an  important  governmental  interest.’’ 2 As  we 
change  our  system  of  broadcasting  from  analog  to  digital,  there  is  no  reason  to  di-
vert  from  this  simple  truth.  Cable  carriage  of  the  full  digital  signal,  whether  one 
HD  or  multiple  program  streams,  would  similarly  help  preserve  our  system  of  free, 
over-the-air local broadcasting, especially for the benefit of viewers solely dependent 
on this means of receiving programming. 

In the 1992 Cable Act, Congress made ‘‘unusually detailed statutory findings’’ re-
garding the ability and incentive of cable operators to refuse carriage of the signals 
of  many  broadcasters,  as  well  as  the  harm  resulting  from  that  refusal.  Turner,  512 
U.S.  at  646.  Congress  found  that  ‘‘because  cable  systems  and  broadcast  stations 
compete  for  local  advertising  revenue,’’  and  ‘‘because  cable  operators  have  a  vested 
financial  interest  in  favoring  their  affiliated  programmers  over  broadcast  stations,’’ 
cable operators have a ‘‘built-in economic incentive’’ not to ‘‘carry local broadcast sig-
nals.’’  Id.  Congress  concluded  that  ‘‘absent  a  requirement  that  cable  systems  carry 
the signals of local broadcast stations, the continued availability of free local broad-
cast television would be threatened.’’ Id. Indeed, without the 1992 Cable Act, ‘‘cable 
systems  would  likely  carry  significantly  fewer  over-the-air  stations,’’  ‘‘station  reve-
nues  would  therefore  decline,’’  and  the  ‘‘quality  of  over-the-air  programming  on 
these stations would almost inevitably suffer.’’ 3 

The  Federal  Communications  Commission’s  refusal  to  recognize  a  carriage  re-
quirement for broadcasters’ multicast programming streams within their digital sig-
nals  has  endangered  the  vibrant,  free  over-the-air  service  that  Congress  explicitly 
sought to protect in the Cable Act.4 Cable operators today compete with local broad-
cast  stations  even  more  fiercely  for  advertising  revenue,  and  continue  to  have  ‘‘a 
vested financial interest in favoring their affiliated programmers over broadcast sta-
tions,’’ thus retaining an ‘‘economic incentive’’ to refuse to ‘‘carry local broadcast sig-
nals.’’ 5 The  consequences  of  the  FCC’s  action  giving  cable  operators  the  power  to 
refuse  carriage  of  significant  broadcast  programming  makes  effective  competition 
between  broadcasters  and  cable  operators  virtually  impossible.  Cable  systems  now 
have  the  ability  to  deny  their  direct  competitors—the  broadcasters—access  to  their 
subscribers,  totaling  two-thirds  of  the  potential  audience,  for  any  innovative  digital 
multicasting  services.  Broadcasters  deprived  of  the  ability  to  take  advantage  of  the 
full economic opportunity that digital technology offers will be unable to compete ef-
fectively  for  the  critical  advertising  revenue  upon  which  broadcasters  (unlike  cable 
operators)  almost  solely  depend.  The  absence  of  a  multicast  carriage  requirement 
therefore threatens to undermine the viability of local broadcast stations in the dig-
ital  age,  leading  to  precisely  the  decline  in  the  quality  and  diversity  of  over-the-air 
programming  that  Congress  sought  to  forestall  in  the  Cable  Act.  And  not  only  will

11 

television stations and our system of local broadcasting be injured—viewers who de-
pend  on  over-the-air  broadcasting  for  their  entertainment  and  information  will  be 
the ultimate losers. 

The  dangers  presented  by  the  FCC’s  refusal  to  grant  full  signal  carriage  will  be 
particularly  acute  for  over-the-air  viewers  served  by  broadcasters  in  small  and  me-
dium markets. As the Commission itself has recognized, ‘‘the ability of local stations 
to  compete  successfully  in  the  delivered  video  market  [has  been]  meaningfully  (and 
negatively)  affected  in  mid-sized  and  smaller  markets.’’ 6 Given  the  already  fragile 
financial  condition  of  many  smaller  market  television  broadcasters,  the  economic 
threat posed by cable companies’ failure to carry multicasting streams is real. Lack 
of  full  signal  carriage  will  have  a  major  impact  on  broadcasters’  ability  to  sustain 
the  very  significant  costs  associated  with  the  digital  transition,  including  the  costs 
of  developing  new  and  innovative  programming  for  multicast  channels.  These  costs 
are  proportionally  much  greater  for  broadcasters  in  small  and  medium-sized  mar-
kets.  Multicasting  would  permit  broadcasters  to  spread  the  costs  of  providing  this 
new  programming  (including  local  news  and  information)  over  more  revenue 
streams.  Offering  multiple  programming  streams  will  also  enhance  broadcasters’ 
ability  to  compete  with  multichannel  cable  operators  for  the  limited  pool  of  adver-
tising  dollars.  Thus,  the  absence  of  a  full  signal  carriage  requirement  will  be  espe-
cially  deleterious  for  broadcasters  in  medium  and  small  markets  and  for  smaller, 
less  profitable  broadcasters  in  all  markets,  the  very  stations  that  will  likely  not  be 
carried via retransmission consent negotiations. 

For  these  reasons,  the  governmental  interest  in  a  vibrant,  free  over-the-air  local 
broadcasting system would be directly advanced by preventing cable operators from 
blocking  the  growth  of  new  programming  options,  including  multicast  program 
streams.  Congress  has  a  clear  ‘‘interest  in  preserving  a  multiplicity  of  broadcasters 
to  ensure  that  all  households  have  access  to  information  and  entertainment  on  an 
equal  footing  with  those  who  subscribe  to  cable.’’  Turner,  520  U.S.  at  194.  A  full 
signal  carriage  requirement  is  essential  to  preserving  a  competitively  healthy  local 
broadcasting system providing a rich mix of over-the-air programming, especially for 
viewers solely dependent on free television. 
Full  Signal  Carriage  Will  Promote 

the  Development  of  Diverse 

Programming for the Viewing Public as a Whole 

Beyond  preserving  the  benefits  of  free,  over-the-air  broadcasting,  Congress  found 
in the 1992 Cable Act, that ‘‘must-carry’’ promoted the widespread dissemination of 
information  from  a  multiplicity  of  sources.7 When  approving  the  analog  must-carry 
rules, the Supreme Court agreed that this also is an important governmental inter-
est. Turner, 512 U.S. at 662–63. A full digital carriage requirement would similarly 
promote the development and dissemination of diverse programming from a variety 
of sources for all television viewers, whether they subscribe to cable or not. 

Broadcast signals are the only channels on a cable system (except for local access 
and  PEG  channels)  that  are  not  under  the  control  of  a  single  voice,  the  cable  oper-
ator.  Congress  has  found  that  a  ‘‘primary  objective  and  benefit  of  our  Nation’s  sys-
tem of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of programming,’’ 
and that ‘‘[b]roadcast stations continue to be an important source of local news and 
public affairs programming and other local broadcast services critical to an informed 
electorate.’’ 8 Increasing  the  opportunity  for  local  television  stations  to  provide  new 
and innovative digital services directly advances these Congressional goals, particu-
larly  in  light  of  current  concerns  over  clustering  and  consolidation  in  the  cable  in-
dustry.9 Carriage of broadcasters’ multicast program streams will in fact guarantee 
that  additional  programming  sources  not  under  the  control  of  a  cable  operator,  are 
widely  accessible  and  added  to  the  information  mix  available  to  both  cable  sub-
scribers and over-the-air viewers alike in communities throughout the country. 

A  brief  sampling  of  the  multicast  services  that  television  stations  are  currently 
providing,  or  plan  to  offer,  is  instructive.  As  shown  below,  local  broadcasters  are 
using, and plan to use digital multicasting streams to provide a wide variety of pro-
gramming  that  is  currently  not  available  either  over-the-air  or  on  most  cable  sys-
tems.  And  much  of  this  programming  is  exactly  the  type  of  local  and  informational 
programming that Congress sought in the Cable Act to promote. 

According  to  Decisionmark,  a  media  technology  company,  585  television  stations 
currently  offer  at  least  some  multicast  programming,  and  many  of  these  stations 
offer  three  or  more  multicast  channels.  This  programming  includes  news,  weather, 
sports, and religious material. This multicast programming also includes content in 
foreign  languages  ranging  from  Arabic  to  Vietnamese,  with  a  number  of  stations 
providing Spanish multicast programming. 

Broadcasters have also described their multicast programming and their plans for 
multicasting  in  numerous  submissions  to  the  FCC.10 For  example,  NBC  affiliated

stations want to multicast weather channels, as well as local alerts, and traffic and 
travel-related  information.  CBS  and  NBC  affiliates  are  planning  local  news  chan-
nels that would offer local news and extended coverage of local events, local sports, 
and AMBER alerts for missing children.11 The New York Times Broadcasting Group 
is  exploring  ways  to  use  multicasting  to  provide  focused  local  news  to  viewers  in 
particular  towns  and  communities.  The  CBS  affiliate  in  Toledo,  Ohio,  is  exploring 
opportunities  for  multicasting  state  legislative  debates,  mayoral  press  conferences, 
city  council  hearings,  and  school  committee  hearings.  The  ABC  affiliate  in  Fresno, 
California, aired full screen election results on its second channel during the guber-
natorial  recall  election.  Beyond  utilizing  multicast  capabilities  to  offer  increased 
local  news  and  other  local  programming  including  public  affairs,  weather  and 
sports,  broadcasters  have  also  indicated  their  interest  in  using  multicasting  to  air 
minority-oriented, children’s, and educational programming.12 

Broadcast  stations  are  currently  offering  multicast  programming  and  hope  in  the 
future  to  offer  even  greater  amounts  and  types  of  multicast  services.  However,  the 
absence of any assurance of multicast carriage is a powerful disincentive for broad-
casters  to  invest  the  considerable  sums  needed  to  develop  multiple  streams  of  lo-
cally-oriented  and  other  innovative  multicast  programming.  For  example,  DIC  En-
tertainment has stated that its plan to offer nationally a free, advertiser-supported, 
over-the-air  digital  children’s  television  service  is  practically  infeasible  in  the  ab-
sence  of  mandatory  carriage  for  multicast  streams.13 No  free,  over-the-air  service 
dependent upon advertising revenue can hope to survive if it is not carried by cable 
systems, and can therefore be received only by that relatively small segment of the 
viewing  public  that  does  not  subscribe  to  cable.  Broadcasters  will  be  reluctant  to 
bring  their  multicast  service  plans  to  fruition  in  the  absence  of  a  clear  full  digital 
signal carriage requirement. Stations rightly fear that they will be unable to obtain 
carriage on many cable systems, and that their substantial investments in multicast 
services  will  be  stranded.  As  a  result,  cable  subscribers  and  non-subscribers  alike 
will  be  deprived  of  the  full  benefits  that  digital  technology  enables,  including 
multicast programming selected to reflect the tastes and needs of their local commu-
nities. 

Commercial  broadcasters  have  in  fact  experienced  substantial  difficulties  in  ob-
taining  full  signal  carriage  through  negotiations  with  cable  operators.14 The  agree-
ment  reached  between  public  television  stations  and  the  cable  industry  pertaining 
to  carriage  rights  does  not  in  any  way  suggest  that  commercial  broadcast  stations 
will  be  similarly  successful  in  negotiating  carriage  for  multicast  programming  on 
reasonable terms. Unlike public stations, commercial stations directly compete with 
cable for advertising dollars, so cable operators have greatly increased incentives to 
deny full signal carriage to commercial stations.15 

In light of the multicast services currently offered by broadcasters and their plans 
to  develop  further  multicast  streams  to  serve  their  local  communities  with  a  wide 
range  of  programming,  allowing  cable  operators  to  exercise  unchecked  their  power 
to  refuse  carriage  of  this  valuable  programming  does  not  serve  the  public  interest. 
A  full  signal  carriage  requirement  would  ensure  that  broadcasters’  multicast  pro-
gramming  streams  can  be  accessed  by  that  majority  of  the  viewing  public  sub-
scribing to cable, and would therefore serve Congress’ interest in promoting the de-
velopment  and  dissemination  of  a  wide  variety  of  programming  from  a  multiplicity 
of sources. 
Full Signal Carriage Will Advance the Digital Transition 

The  offering  of  attractive  digital  programming,  including  multicast  programming, 
by  local  television  stations  will  provide  incentives  to  consumers  to  purchase  digital 
reception  capability  (such  as  an  HD  receiver  or  a  converter  that  will  allow  viewing 
of digital programs on analog sets), thereby facilitating the end of the digital transi-
tion.16 For  example,  WDBJ  in  Roanoke,  Virginia,  which  provides  two  locally-origi-
nated multicasting services, ‘‘is helping to stimulate consumer sales of digital tuners 
in  [its]  viewing  area.’’  To  accelerate  the  digital  transition,  the  station  ‘‘has  fostered 
two-way  communication  with  viewers  owning  digital  receivers  and  HDTV  sets’’  by 
sending  regular  e-mail  updates  about  WDBJ’s  digital  HD  and  multicast  services  to 
customers who have told the station they have digital sets.17 

If, however, broadcasters’ multicast programming streams are not carried on cable 
systems, then viewers subscribing to cable will be unable to receive those program-
ming  streams  even  if  they  purchase  digital  receivers—which  will  obviously  reduce 
the  incentive  of  consumers  to  obtain  digital  reception  capability.  The  absence  of  a 
full signal carriage requirement will accordingly retard the pace of the digital tran-
sition,  which  does  not  serve  the  public  interest.  Beyond  clearing  spectrum  for  auc-
tion and, ultimately, the provision of new wireless and other services for consumers,

advancing the digital transition will, most importantly, clear spectrum for the provi-
sion of vital public safety services. 
Particularly  in  Light  of  the  Rapid  Growth  in  Cable  Capacity,  the  Burden 

of Full Signal Carriage on Cable Operators Would Be Negligible 

Not only will requiring carriage of multicast digital programming streams provide 
myriad  benefits  to  the  viewing  public  and  to  our  system  of  free,  over-the-air  broad-
casting, such a carriage requirement will entail little burden on cable operators, par-
ticularly  in  light  of  the  tremendous  expansion  in  cable  capacity  in  recent  years.  In 
fact, requiring digital cable carriage of all of the separate free programming streams 
of  a  broadcaster’s  digital  signal  imposes  no  greater  burden  than  requiring  carriage 
of  a  broadcaster’s  single  digital  channel  (which  is  clearly  already  required  by  the 
1992  Cable  Act).  A  digital  broadcast  signal  will  include  19.4  megabits  per  second 
of data within 6 MHz of spectrum whether it contains one program stream or mul-
tiple streams. From the perspective of the cable operators’ capacity to carry the dig-
ital  broadcast,  there  is  simply  no  difference  between  a  broadcaster’s  decision  to 
broadcast its signal as a single stream or as multiple streams. 

As  an  absolute  matter,  moreover,  the  total  cable  capacity  to  be  used  by  a  digital 
broadcast signal is substantially less than the capacity used to carry a single analog 
signal.  Because  of  modulation  techniques  available  to  digital  cable  operators,  car-
riage  of  the  entire  digital  broadcast  signal  will  use  only  3  MHz  of  cable  capacity. 
Indeed,  cable  systems,  when  responding  to  an  FCC  survey  about  cable  capacity, 
agreed  that  while  cable  carriage  of  one  analog  broadcast  television  signal  required 
a full 6 MHz cable channel, two digital broadcast television signals could be carried 
on that same channel.18 Thus, at the end of the digital transition, digital cable sys-
tems  will  use  only  half  the  capacity  to  transmit  local  broadcast  signals  than  they 
needed for the same stations’ analog signals. And, as discussed above, a broadcaster 
using  its  digital  channel  to  air  multiple  standard  definition  streams  occupies  no 
more cable capacity for the digital signal, as a practical matter, than a broadcaster 
airing  a  single  HD  programming  stream,  which  cable  operators  will  clearly  be  re-
quired to carry pursuant to existing statutory mandates. 

The  alleged  burden  on  cable  operators  of  carrying  broadcasters’  digital  multicast 
programming  streams  is  further  shown  to  be  insignificant  when  one  considers  the 
remarkable  growth  in  the  capacity  of  cable  systems  in  recent  years.  One  estimate, 
drawn  from  the  cable  industry’s  own  responses  to  an  FCC  survey,  concluded  that 
cable program capacity increased 83.5 percent from 1999 to 2003, and additional in-
creases  in  capacity  have  and  will  continue  to  come  online.  Weiss  Study  at  27.  The 
capacity  of  the  average  cable  system  has  grown  so  large  that,  combined  with  the 
benefits  of  digital  compression  technology,  requiring  cable  systems  to  carry  all  free 
programming streams of digital stations would not foreclose cable systems from car-
rying other programs of their choice. Likewise, it would not diminish cable program-
mers’ opportunities to place their programs onto cable systems. 

Indeed, the announced plans of cable operators belie their claims that capacity is 
limited.  Multichannel  News  recently  reported  that  ‘‘[a]ll  the  major  MSOs  have  an-
nounced  plans  to  launch  digital  simulcast—or  are  actively  launching  it—in  their 
systems.’’ 19 Digital  simulcasting  involves  carrying  all  signals  on  a  cable  system— 
cable and broadcast—in both analog and digital formats. Although carrying all pro-
gramming in both digital and analog formats would certainly use far more capacity 
than  carriage  of  local  broadcasters’  digital  signals  (including  their  multicast  pro-
gram  streams),  Comcast’s  Senior  Vice  President  of  Engineering  Operations  stated, 
‘‘[w]e  have  plenty  of  capacity  on  the  network  side.’’ 20 As  another  news  reports  con-
cluded, ‘‘[i]t would seem unlikely that [Comcast and Time Warner] would have a ca-
pacity problem with dual carriage’’ (i.e., carrying both broadcasters’ analog and dig-
ital signals during the digital transition), if ‘‘voluntary dual carriage is their publicly 
announced  business  plan.’’ 21 This  committee,  therefore,  cannot  take  seriously  cable 
operators’  claims  that  carriage  of  broadcasters’  digital  multicast  program  streams 
imposes a material capacity burden on cable systems. 
Requiring  Cable  Operators  To  Carry  Local  Stations’  Full  Digital  Signals 

Would Clearly Be Constitutional 

In  the  absence  of  a  burden  on  cable  systems  from  the  carriage  of  broadcasters’ 
multicast programming streams, a full signal carriage requirement would pass con-
stitutional  muster.  Indeed,  given  the  expansion  of  cable  capacity  previously  de-
scribed, carriage of local broadcast digital signals would not have a material impact 
on  cable  speech,  and  thus  a  full  signal  carriage  rule  should  not  even  be  subject  to 
a First Amendment question. 

As  discussed  in  detail  above,  the  burden  imposed  by  carriage  of  multiple  broad-
cast  streams  of  a  single  digital  signal  is  no  more  than  the  burden  imposed  by  car-

riage  of  a  single  digital  broadcast  signal.  Further,  the  burden  imposed  by  carriage 
of  a  digital  broadcast  signal—whether  multiple  streams  or  a  single  stream—is  less 
as  an  absolute  matter  than  the  burden  imposed  by  analog  must-carry  approved  by 
the Supreme Court in the Turner cases.22 In addition, due to the explosion of cable 
capacity,  and  the  lack  of  any  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  full  power  local 
television stations, the relative burden imposed by carriage of these stations’ signals 
is  now  a  fraction  of  that  approved  in  the  Turner  cases.  Indeed,  even  the  carriage 
of  both  the  analog  and  digital  signals  of  all  local  commercial  television  stations 
would  occupy  a  far  smaller  percentage  of  cable  capacity  than  did  carriage  of  only 
analog stations when the must-carry statute went into effect.23 The Supreme Court 
in  Turner  regarded  that  burden  as  minimal  and  acceptable,  particularly  in  light  of 
the  important  benefits  afforded  by  must-carry.24 Clearly,  the  smaller  burden  pre-
sented by requiring carriage of broadcasters’ digital multicast programming streams 
should not raise any serious First Amendment questions. 

In  sum,  given  the  increase  in  cable  capacity  in  recent  years,  only  a  tiny  fraction 
of that capacity will be devoted to carrying local broadcasters’ digital signals, includ-
ing  their  multicast  programming  streams.  Consequently,  a  full  signal  carriage  re-
quirement  would  not  have  a  remotely  significant  impact  on  the  programming 
choices  made  by  cable  systems,  or  the  opportunity  of  cable  programmers  to  obtain 
carriage.  Because  cable  programming  choices  would  not  be  materially  affected  by 
any  digital  must-carry  obligations,  no  First  Amendment  issue  would  even  be  impli-
cated by a full digital signal carriage requirement.25 By upholding the analog must- 
carry rules, which represented an absolutely and relatively greater burden on cable 
operators  than  digital  must-carry  obligations  would,  the  Supreme  Court  settled  the 
question of the constitutionality of any full signal carriage requirement. 
Conclusion 

Mr.  Chairman,  NAB  and  its  television  stations  members  are  committed  to  com-
pleting  the  digital  transition  expeditiously,  and  to  bringing  the  benefits  of  digital 
technology to viewers throughout the country. Digital broadcasting promises both to 
enhance  the  competitive  viability  of  local  commercial  television  stations,  and  to 
bring  improved  video  services  to  the  viewing  public.  But  the  full  benefits  of  digital 
technology  may  not  be  realized  if  cable  operators  are  allowed  to  prevent  the  vast 
majority  of  television  viewers  from  accessing  the  multiple  streams  of  digital  broad-
cast  material  offered  by  local  television  stations.  Requiring  cable  systems  to  carry 
broadcasters’  multicast  programming  streams  will  help  ensure  a  vibrant,  free  over- 
the-air  local  broadcasting  system,  will  promote  the  development  of  diverse  digital 
programming, and will advance the digital transition. These benefits can, moreover, 
be  achieved  without  burdening  cable  systems  or  infringing  the  First  Amendment 
rights of cable operators. Again, NAB wishes to express its appreciation to the mem-
bers  of  the  Commerce  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  and  for  their  atten-
tion today.

13 See  Petition  for  Reconsideration  of  DIC  Entertainment  Corporation,  CS  Docket 
98–120 at 3 (filed April 21, 2005). DIC stated that no competitive children’s service 
of the kind it envisioned can expect to arrange reasonable carriage terms with cable 
operators  ‘‘that  have  significant  reasons  to  protect  the  children’s  services  they  are 
already  carrying.’’  Because  a  number  of  cable  operators  now  have  their  own  local 
or regional news channels, they are also unlikely to carry a competitive multicasting 
news stream from a local broadcast station. 

14 Decisionmark  has  noted  the  substantial  percentage  of  multicasting  commercial 
stations  that  cannot  obtain  carriage  for  even  one  multicasting  service.  Even  large 
television  groups,  including  LIN  Television,  Hearst-Argyle  Television,  and  the  New 
York  Times  Broadcasting  Group,  have  cited  their  inability  to  successfully  negotiate 
with many cable operators for multicast carriage. And if these groups cannot obtain 
carriage  for  their  multicast  services,  then  smaller  broadcast  groups  or  stand-alone 
stations would very likely experience even greater difficulties in obtaining carriage. 
For  instance,  Marantha  Broadcasting  Company  in  Pennsylvania  has  reported  that 
it  has  been  unable  to  negotiate  carriage  with  large  cable  operators  for  its  24-hour 
local weather multicast service. 

15 See  47  U.S.C.  § 521  note  (Cable  Act  § 2(a)(15)).  And  as  discussed  above,  broad-
casters  and  cable  operators  compete  much  more  fiercely  today  for  advertising  rev-
enue than they did when the Cable Act was passed.

than carrying just one 6 MHz analog signal in one cable channel. 

23 According  to  the  Weiss  Study,  based  on  the  cable  industry’s  own  reports  of  its 
capacity, in 1993, when the (analog) must-carry rules first became effective, carriage 
of  local  commercial  stations  occupied  13.35  percent  of  the  capacity  of  the  average 
cable system. By 1999, cable capacity used by local commercial stations fell by more 
than half to 6.25 percent. The study estimated that only 8.46 percent of cable capac-
ity would be needed for transmission of both analog and digital local commercial sig-
nals  when  all  stations  were  transmitting  two  signals  during  the  digital  transition. 
And the study concluded that when analog broadcasting ceased altogether, carrying 
all local digital commercial signals would occupy only 2.63 percent of cable capacity.

STATEMENT  OF  MANUEL  ABUD,  VICE  PRESIDENT/GENERAL 
MANAGER,  KVEA–TV,  LOS  ANGELES,  CA;  ON  BEHALF  OF 
TELEMUNDO 
Mr.  ABUD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Co-Chairman  Inouye, 

members of the Committee. 

My name is Manuel Abud. I’m Vice President and General Man-
ager  of  KVEA  Television,  Channel  52,  which  is  a  Television 
Telemundo Station, in Los Angeles. And I thank you for the oppor-
tunity to testify today on behalf of Telemundo regarding issues sur-
rounding the digital television transition. 

My  appearance  before  you  today  is  not  simply  as  a  Telemundo 
executive, or even as a broadcaster; I’m also testifying in my capac-
ity  as  a  member  of  the  Hispanic  community.  My  community  is  de-
pendent  on  Spanish-language  over-the-air  broadcasting  as  a  pri-
mary  source  of  news  and  local  information.  My  station  alone  does 
19.5  hours  per  week  of  local  Spanish-language  news  to  serve  our 
viewers. 

Forty-three  percent  of  Spanish-speaking  households  watch  over- 
the-air  television,  exclusively.  Moreover,  digital  television  tech-
nology  has  failed  to  make  significant  inroads  into  the  Hispanic 
community.  If  Congress  produces  DTV  legislation  that  fails  to  ex-
tend  the  benefits  of  DTV  to  all  consumers,  Spanish-language  tele-
vision viewers will be disproportionately harmed. 

Telemundo  supports  a  hard  cutoff  date  for  ending  analog  broad-
casts,  but  setting  a  hard  deadline  remains  only  one  piece  of  the 
puzzle. Several other components must be addressed in order to en-
sure  that  the  transition  to  digital  television  is  one  that  consumers 
will view as a net gain, and not as a net loss. 

First,  a  subsidy  is  needed  for  consumers  to  purchase  digital-to- 
analog converters. We must ensure that households that rely exclu-
sively  on  over-the-air  broadcasting,  such  as  the  mainly  Spanish- 
speaking  households,  are  not  literally  left  in  the  dark  once  analog 
television is shut off. Failure to include a consumer assistance pro-
gram in DTV legislation will have a disproportionately negative im-
pact on Spanish-language households. 

Second, MVPD carriage of digital multicast is essential. The abil-
ity to send multiple additional free channels of programming with-
out  using  additional  spectrum  allows  broadcasters  to  serve  their 
local communities better than ever before through hyper-local news

and  community  information,  local  political  coverage,  and  local 
weather and traffic. Multicast channels also permit more rapid, de-
tailed,  and  geographically  targeted  dissemination  of  local  and  na-
tional emergency information. 

What excites me most about multicasting is that it would enable 
Telemundo  to  greatly  expand  the  amount,  breadth,  and  quality  of 
free  broadcast  programming  serving  Hispanic  communities.  This 
could  make  a  very  meaningful,  positive  contribution  to  Spanish- 
speaking  citizens.  Absent  a  meaningful,  must-carry  requirement 
that  includes  multicast  carriage,  this  digital  dividend  will  be  sac-
rificed. 

Without having assurances that the entire Spanish-language au-
dience  will  have  access  to  multicast  programming  channels,  we 
cannot  create  a  workable  business  model  with  which  to  fund  this 
initiative.  As  a  result,  ironically,  as  Congress  is  requiring  millions 
of  consumers  to  invest  in  new  digital  equipment  in  order  to  watch 
television,  it  will  simultaneously  be  depriving  them  of  one  of  the 
most important benefits they will receive for their purchases. 

Third,  consumers  must  have  access  to  DTV  signals  in  un-de-
graded form. A conversion to DTV that requires consumers to pur-
chase  new  equipment,  and  yet  diminishes  or  denies  consumers  ac-
cess to HDTV, a paramount benefit of digital television technology, 
makes  absolutely  no  sense.  Multichannel  video-programming  pro-
viders  must  be  required  to  retransmit  any  and  all  broadcast  sig-
nals,  including  high-definition  programming  on  their  basic  tier  in 
its  original  format  and  quality  to  all  subscribers.  Additionally,  if  a 
cable operator chooses to down-convert any digital broadcast signal 
at  the  cable  headend,  it  should  be  permitted  to  do  so  only  as  long 
as  the  cable  operator  does  the  same  for  all  broadcast  channels  it 
retransmits.  Absent  such  a  requirement,  a  cable  operator  could 
choose to provide an analog feed of only the top network affiliates, 
and  leave  in  the  lurch  the  analog  viewers  of  smaller  religious  and 
foreign-language broadcast channels, including Telemundo. 

Finally,  every  stakeholder  has  a  responsibility  to  augment  their 
efforts  to  educate  Americans  about  the  digital  transition.  Tele-
mundo supports mandated point-of-sale consumer notices by retail-
ers and manufacturers. 

Thank you, again, for this opportunity to appear before you today 
and  share  with  you  concerns  of  Spanish-speaking  Americans  who 
have much to gain, but also much to lose in this digital transition.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MANUEL ABUD, VICE PRESIDENT/GENERAL MANAGER, 

KVEA–TV, LOS ANGELES, CA; ON BEHALF OF TELEMUNDO 

Chairman  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye,  and  members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is 
Manuel  Abud,  and  I  am  the  Vice  President  and  General  Manager  of  KVEA–TV, 
Channel  52,  Telemundo’s  station  in  Los  Angeles,  California.  Thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity  to  testify  before  you  today  on  behalf  of  Telemundo  regarding  issues  sur-
rounding the transition to digital television. 

I testify today not simply as a Telemundo executive, or even just as a broadcaster, 
but  also  as  a  member  of  the  Hispanic-American  community,  and  as  a  Spanish  lan-
guage  speaker.  Many  members  of  my  community  speak  Spanish  as  their  primary 
language, and are dependent on Spanish language over-the-air broadcasting as their 
primary  source  of  news  and  local  information.  We  are  the  ‘‘go  to’’  source  for  news 
and  information  for  the  Spanish  speaking  community.  The  work  of  this  committee 
ultimately  will  determine  to  what  extent  Spanish  language  television  viewers  con-

tinue  to  have  critical  access  to  free  over-the-air  Spanish  language  television  in  the 
digital era. 

Households where Spanish is the primary language are far more likely to rely on 
over-the-air  television  than  other  households.  Nationally,  43  percent  of  households 
where  Spanish  is  the  primary  language  spoken  watch  over-the-air  television  exclu-
sively. At the same time, analysis of the consumer market reveals that digital tele-
vision  technology  has  failed  to  make  significant  inroads  into  the  Hispanic  commu-
nity.  Nielsen  data  indicates  that  the  use  of  DTV  receivers  in  Hispanic  households 
nationally  is  the  lowest  among  all  consumer  groups.  As  a  result,  if  Congress  fails 
to  produce  a  final  DTV  transition  plan  that  focuses  on  extending  the  benefits  of 
DTV to all consumers, Spanish language television viewers will be subject to a dis-
proportionate share of the resulting harm. In short, we really need the Congress to 
get the DTV transition RIGHT. 

Getting  it  right  means  ensuring  that  Spanish-speaking  consumers  have  access  to 
the revolutionary benefits that digital television offers, especially high-definition tel-
evision  programming  and  multicasting.  It  also  means  that  our  audiences  are  not 
disenfranchised,  whether  they  rely  on  over-the-air  broadcasting,  cable,  or  satellite 
for their television. The disruption and cost accompanying the DTV transition must 
be kept to a minimum. 

As this committee works to craft digital television transition legislation, it is crit-
ical  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  need  to  bring  the  digital  television  transition 
to  a  close,  while  also  protecting  the  overwhelming  majority  of  consumers  who  still 
only  have  analog  television  sets,  and  ensuring  that  the  exciting  new  services  that 
digital  technologies  enables  are  available  and  enjoyed  by  all  consumers,  especially 
minority and lower-income consumers. 

Telemundo supports a hard cut-off date for ending analog broadcasts. But setting 
a hard deadline remains only one piece of the puzzle. Several other components also 
must  be  addressed—simultaneously—in  order  to  ensure  that  the  transition  to  dig-
ital television is one that consumers will view as a net gain and not a net loss. For 
instance,  the  millions  of  consumers  who  rely  exclusively  on  over-the-air  broad-
casting—many  of  whom  are  Hispanic  and  lower-income—must  have  some  Federal 
support  for  their  purchase  of  equipment  that  will  ensure  their  sets  do  not  go  black 
the  day  analog  broadcasts  cease.  These  consumers,  as  well  as  those  receiving  local 
broadcast  signals  via  cable  or  satellite,  also  cannot  be  denied  the  full  value  and 
suite of benefits offered by digital television—this especially includes additional free 
digital channels that broadcasters provide, and HDTV without degradation. Finally, 
especially if a hard deadline is set, every stakeholder has a responsibility—actually, 
I  believe  it’s  more  of  an  opportunity—to  educate  every  American  about  the  transi-
tion  and  what  they  need  to  know  to  make  it  themselves.  I  address  each  of  these 
issues briefly below. 
A  Subsidy  Is  Needed  for  Consumers  To  Purchase  Digital-to-Analog 

Converters 

There  has  been  much  discussion  of  the  need  for  some  form  of  Federal  assistance 
to  consumers—especially  those,  like  many  Hispanic  and  lower-income  citizens,  who 
rely  exclusively  on  over-the-air  broadcasting—who  will  need  to  purchase  additional 
equipment  to  receive  digital  television  signals.  While  Telemundo  is  not  suggesting 
any  particular  approach,  we  do  support  the  inclusion  of  a  consumer  assistance  pro-
gram  that,  at  a  minimum,  ensures  that  households  exclusively  reliant  on  over-the- 
air  broadcasting  are  not  literally  left  in  the  dark  once  analog  television  is  shut  off. 
As I previously noted, failure to include a consumer assistance program in DTV leg-
islation  will  have  a  disproportionately  negative  impact  on  Spanish  language  house-
holds, who are not currently purchasing DTV products, and who will be hit hardest 
when  the  final  cut-off  date  arrives.  A  subsidy  program  to  defray  the  costs  of  a  dig-
ital-to-analog  converter  box  is  a  necessity  in  any  mandated  end  to  the  digital  tele-
vision transition. 
MVPD Carriage of Digital Multicast Programming Is Essential 

Digital  television  enables  broadcasters  to  offer  four  or  more  programming  chan-
nels  in  place  of  their  one  analog  channel  without  using  any  additional  spectrum. 
Multicasting  allows  broadcasters  to  serve  their  local  communities  better  than  ever 
before by providing multiple streams of locally-produced or community-oriented pro-
grams,  including  but  not  limited  to:  ‘‘hyper-local’’  news,  covering  smaller  parts  of 
large  metropolitan  areas,  programming  that  covers  local  political  issues  and  can-
didates; newscasts that serve specific segments of the local market; local events, in-
cluding  school  and  amateur  sports  activities;  and  local  weather,  traffic,  and  emer-
gency information.

In this time of heightened alert against terrorism, local broadcast stations are the 
first providers of emergency news and information to the public concerning not only 
actual or potential terror threats to public safety, but also local emergency incidents 
such as chemical spills, dangerous storms, floods, escaped prisoners, and similar in-
cidents of urgent import. Multicast channels permit the rapid dissemination of such 
information  in  much  greater  detail  by  enabling  stations  to  target  information  for 
particular communities on particular streams. 

Beyond  emergency  or  local  information,  the  increasingly  diverse  character  of 
American  society  makes  the  availability  of  Spanish  language,  local  television  pro-
gramming  critically  important  in  permitting  Spanish  language  speaking  residents 
to  become  better  integrated  into,  and  function  more  effectively  in  the  communities 
in  which  they  reside.  Multicasting  increases  the  ability  of  broadcast  stations  to 
transmit  Spanish  language  programming  to  Spanish  speaking  populations  within 
their  service  area.  Absent  a  meaningful  must-carry  requirement  that  includes 
multicast carriage, this digital dividend will be sacrificed. 

Telemundo  and  other  broadcasters  cannot  avail  themselves  of  the  powerful  bene-
fits  of  multicasting  in  the  marketplace  absent  cable  and  satellite  carriage  of 
multicast programming channels. Broadcast television in any language is advertiser 
supported,  and  our  ability  to  attract  advertising  dollars  is  directly  tied  to  the  num-
ber of viewers we have the opportunity to attract to our programming. The majority 
of all television viewers watch broadcast television via cable or satellite, and if those 
services do not carry multicast programming services the overwhelming majority of 
television viewers will not have the opportunity to see them. 

As  a  result,  the  fundamental  basis  upon  which  must-carry  has  been  traditionally 
supported  by  Congress—the  preservation  of  free  over-the-air  television—is  critical 
in  the  context  of  multicasting.  Absent  Congressional  support  for  multicast  must- 
carry,  Telemundo  and  other  Spanish  language  broadcasters  will  have  no  economic 
model  upon  which  to  rely  to  offer  Spanish  language  viewers  new  and  innovative 
multicast  programming  services.  As  Congress  is  requiring  millions  of  consumers  to 
invest  in  new  digital  equipment  in  order  to  watch  television,  it  will  simultaneously 
be  depriving  them  of  one  of  the  most  important  benefits  they  will  receive  for  their 
purchases.  Failure  to  include  multicast  must-carry  in  a  final  DTV  transition  bill 
strikes  at  the  core  of  the  critical  balance  between  reward  and  risk,  upon  which  the 
success of the DTV transition rests. 
Consumers Must Have Access to DTV Signals in Un-Degraded Form 

A  conversion  to  DTV  that  requires  consumers  to  purchase  new  equipment,  and 
yet diminishes or denies consumers’ access to HDTV—a paramount benefit of digital 
television  technology—makes  absolutely  no  sense  at  all.  Multichannel  video  pro-
gramming providers must be required to retransmit any and all broadcast signals— 
including high definition programming—in its original format and quality to all sub-
scribers. Moreover, any DTV transition legislation should require that digital broad-
cast  signals  be  carried  on  a  basic  tier  of  service.  Both  of  these  requirements  serve 
consumers  of  pay  television  services  well  because  they  will  ensure  they  can  receive 
one of the principal benefits of DTV technology—the glorious video and audio qual-
ity of high definition—at affordable rates. 
If Cable Operators Are Given Flexibility To ‘‘Down-Convert,’’ They Must Be 

Required To Do So on a Nondiscriminatory Basis 

Should a cable operator wish to downconvert a digital signal at the cable headend 
to  ensure  continued  service  to  analog  cable  subscribers,  it  should  be  permitted  to 
do  so  only  so  long  as  the  cable  operator  also  provides  an  undegraded  digital  signal 
on the same tier as that down-converted signal. However, if a cable operator avails 
itself of this option, it must be required do so on a nondiscriminatory basis. Absent 
such a requirement, a cable operator could choose to provide an analog feed of only 
the  top  network  affiliates  its  carries,  and  leave  in  the  lurch  the  viewers  of  smaller, 
religious and foreign-language broadcast channels, including Telemundo. This would 
make us unacceptably vulnerable to losing our analog cable subscribers unless cable 
operators decide to give all analog cable subscribers a set top box. Don’t bet on that. 
Cable  industry  leaders  have  repeatedly  stated  that  they  do  not  want  to  disrupt 
analog  cable  subscribers  as  the  DTV  conversion  occurs.  All  we  are  saying,  to  quote 
President Reagan, is: ‘‘Trust, but verify.’’ 
Consumer Education 

Finally, a hugely important component of any DTV transition legislation must be 
consumer  education—every  stakeholder:  retailers,  manufacturers,  cable  operators, 
and, of course, local broadcasters and broadcast networks, must significantly ratchet 
up  their  efforts  to  inform  consumers  about  the  impending  shut  off  of  analog  tele-

vision,  and  their  need  to  purchase  digital  tuning  equipment  in  order  to  continue  to 
receive free broadcast services. 

This  must  be  done  as  soon  as  possible.  It  must  be  well-coordinated,  understand-
able  to  the  average  citizen,  and  ubiquitous.  In  particular,  Telemundo  believes  it  is 
critical  that  consumers  considering  the  purchase  of  an  analog-only  television  be  in-
formed at the point-of-purchase—by the retailer or other seller, whether in a brick- 
and-mortar retail store or a website, and by manufacturers, through a product label, 
about  the  conversion  date,  the  need  for  digital  tuning  capability,  and  the  potential 
limitations of analog-only equipment. 

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today,  and  share  with  you  con-
cerns of Spanish speaking Americans who have much to gain but also much to lose 
in the digital television transition. I stand ready to work with each Member of this 
Committee to ensure that final digital television transition legislation serves the in-
terests of our Nation and of all television viewers. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Our  next  witness  is  Kyle  McSlarrow,  President 
and CEO of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. 

STATEMENT OF KYLE MCSLARROW, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

NATIONAL CABLE & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION 

(NCTA) 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Co-Chairman,  members  of 
the  Committee,  I  appreciate  your  invitation  to  appear  here  today. 
I  applaud  your  committee’s  leadership  to  address  the  return  of 
the analog spectrum from broadcasters, particularly for public-safe-
ty  purposes.  That  is  why,  Mr.  Chairman,  when  you  asked  us  for 
our  assistance  we  committed  to  provide  a  constructive  solution  for 
cable customers. 

Our proposed solution is to provide cable operators the flexibility, 
once  the  analog  spectrum  has  been  returned,  to  down-convert  the 
digital  signals  from  must-carry  broadcasters.  What  this  means,  as 
a practical matter, is that the over-40-million cable customers who 
can  only  receive  an  analog  service  will  enjoy  the  same  service  the 
day after the transition that they received the day before. It means 
that many stations, including public television stations, network af-
filiates,  and  other  stations  that  have  negotiated  agreements  with 
the  cable  industry,  would  be  carried  in  digital,  just  as  they  are 
today.  It  means  that  those  of  our  customers  who  have  the  capa-
bility  to  receive  high-definition  television  signals  will  continue  to 
receive increasing numbers of high-definition channels from among 
the  23  cable  networks  offering  high  definition,  and  many  commer-
cial  and  public  broadcasters,  as  well.  And,  though  it  will  cost  the 
cable  industry  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  to  re-engineer  our  facili-
ties to provide for down-conversion, it won’t cost the government a 
dime. But, instead of embracing this solution, the broadcasters con-
tinue to ask you for special favors. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  broadcasters  are  urging  you  to  impose  re-
quirements  on  the  cable  industry  that  they  have  repeatedly  failed 
to convince Congress and the FCC to impose and that would be un-
constitutional under the Turner line of Supreme Court cases. 

The  most  plausible  interpretation  is  that  the  broadcasters  hope 
to  goad  the  cable  industry  into  joining  them  in  their  passive-ag-
gressive opposition to a hard date. Perhaps a more charitable inter-
pretation is, they view this as one more opportunity to make a land 
grab.  In  any  event,  they  are  making  your  task  harder,  not  easier. 
Broadcasters are not the only ones in America making the transi-
tion to digital, and they should not be given preferential treatment

in  a  competitive  marketplace,  especially  by  government  mandate. 
However  they  describe  it,  what  they’re  asking  for  is  obvious:  gov-
ernment-mandated carriage of both an analog and a digital version 
of  the  same  signal,  and  carriage  of  multiple  streams  of  program-
ming. 

The  broadcasters  seem  not  to  understand  that  cable,  in  addition 
to  being  a  television  provider,  is  also  the  largest  broadband  pro-
vider  in  the  United  States.  We  have  one  pipe,  upgraded  with 
fiberoptic technology, with very robust capacity, but it is not unlim-
ited. By law, we already have to offer public access and other pub-
lic educational and governmental video programming. We also have 
to  offer  carriage  to  every  broadcaster  who  chooses  must-carry.  We 
offer  increasing  numbers  of  digital  and  high-definition  program-
ming. And that one cable connection to the home allows us to offer 
not just linear channels of video, we plan to offer video-on-demand, 
including  high-definition  video-on-demand.  That  one  cable  connec-
tion  allows  us  to  offer  highspeed  Internet  services.  It  allows  us  to 
offer circuit-switch telephone services and, increasingly, Voice-over- 
Internet-protocol telephone service. That pipe also allows us to pass 
data  back  and  forth  for  current  and  new  applications  of  two-way 
services. 

All  of  this  requires  a  lot  of  capacity,  but  we  are  in  an  incredibly 
competitive market. We have to continue innovating. So, for exam-
ple,  in  the  next  few  years  we  plan  to  offer  Internet  speeds  of  up 
to  160  megabits  per  second,  compared  with  the  average  of,  say,  5 
megabits  per  second  today.  That  is  the  kind  of  broadband  deploy-
ment  that  most  of  the  members  of  this  committee  want  to  see  de-
ployed.  But  to  do  that  means  we  have  to  use  from  four  to  eight 
times  the  bandwidth,  or  capacity,  as  we  do  today  to  deliver  this 
next generation of high-speed Internet service. 

That  kind  of  innovation  doesn’t  just  happen;  it  requires  a  regu-
latory  framework  that  provides  certainty  and  that  rewards  invest-
ment.  And  the  kind  of  investment  we  have  made,  nearly  $100  bil-
lion  over  the  least  10  years,  is  what  it  took  to  put  us  in  this  posi-
tion.  That  kind  of  investment  will  not  happen  if  someone  can  just 
come off the sidelines and take capacity for themselves. If that hap-
pens,  innovation  will  suffer,  because  some  services  won’t  stay  on 
our pipe, and some services will never make it on. That is precisely 
the kind of choice about innovation and services that a free market 
should determine, not a government mandate. 

Mr. Chairman, I would just make one final point. This committee 
can discharge its responsibilities and advance public safety without 
wading  into  this  morass.  Nothing  the  broadcasters  have  proposed 
has  the  slightest  bearing  on  how  you  can  best  ensure  the  return 
of the spectrum, and how you can do so with a minimum of incon-
venience to consumers. 

We  have  tried  to  provide  you  a  sensible  approach  to  assist  your 
efforts,  and  we  look  forward,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  continuing  to  work 
with you and members of this committee on this important legisla-
tion. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KYLE MCSLARROW, PRESIDENT/CEO, 
NATIONAL CABLE & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION (NCTA) 

Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Co-Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is  Kyle 
McSlarrow.  I  am  the  President  and  CEO  of  the  National  Cable  &  Telecommuni-
cations  Association,  and  it  is  a  privilege  to  appear  before  you  today.  NCTA  is  the 
principal  trade  association  for  the  cable  television  industry  in  the  United  States.  It 
represents  cable  operators  serving  more  than  90  percent  of  the  Nation’s  66  million 
cable  television  households  and  more  than  200  cable  program  networks,  as  well  as 
equipment suppliers and providers of ancillary services to the cable industry. 

I  appreciate  your  invitation  to  testify  on  pending  Congressional  efforts  to  speed 
the  transition  to  digital  television.  As  I  have  mentioned  during  our  listening  ses-
sions with this committee, cable is at the forefront of the digital revolution and was 
the  first  industry  to  deliver  on  the  promises  of  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act, 
including  high-speed  access  to  the  Internet  and  facilities-based  competition  for  the 
telephone companies. Cable was also the first in 2002 to respond to the FCC’s calls 
for assistance in expediting the broadcasters’ transition to digital television.1 

Mr.  Chairman,  while  the  cable  industry  has  taken  no  formal  position  on  a  ‘‘hard 
date’’  for  the  broadcasters’  return  of  the  analog  spectrum,  we  understand  and  ap-
plaud your committee’s leadership in grappling with the important policies inherent 
in the return of that spectrum, particularly for public safety purposes. 

That  is  why  when  you  asked  us  for  our  assistance,  we  committed  to  providing  a 
constructive solution for an early return of the spectrum that would ensure all cable 
customers would face a seamless transition at no cost to the government. 

Our solution is to provide cable operators the flexibility, once the analog spectrum 
has  been  returned,  to  ‘‘down-convert’’  the  digital  signals  from  must-carry  broad-
casters at the cable headend. 

What  this  means,  as  a  practical  matter,  is  that  the  over  40  million  cable  cus-
tomers who can only receive an analog service will not lose access to must-carry sta-
tions, and will enjoy the same service the day after the transition that they received 
the day before. 

It  means  that  many  stations—including  public  television  stations,  network  affili-
ates,  and  other  stations  that  have  negotiated  retransmission  consent  agreements 
with the cable industry—would be carried in digital as well, just as they are today. 
It means that those of our customers who have the capability to receive high defi-
nition  television  signals  will  continue  to  receive  increasing  numbers  of  high  defini-
tion  channels  from  among  the  23  cable  networks  offering  high  definition  and  many 
commercial and public broadcasters as well. 

And, although it will cost the cable industry tens of millions of dollars to re-engi-
neer  our  facilities  to  provide  down-conversion,  it  won’t  cost  the  government  a  dime. 
Our  solution  is  straightforward.  Our  solution  does  not  attempt  to  make  other  in-
dustries’ businesses more difficult. And our solution allows this committee, and Con-
gress, to concentrate on how to address those Americans who only receive over-the- 
air video programming. 

But instead of embracing our down-conversion solution, the broadcasters continue 

to ask for special favors. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  broadcasters  are  urging  you  to  impose  requirements  on  the 
cable  industry  that  they  have  repeatedly  failed  to  convince  Congress  and  the  FCC 
to  impose,  and  that  would  be  unconstitutional  under  the  Turner  line  of  Supreme 
Court cases. 

Broadcasters  are  not  the  only  ones  in  America  making  the  transition  to  digital, 
and they should not be given preferential treatment in a competitive marketplace— 
especially by government mandate. 

Whether the proposal is called ‘‘either/or,’’ or down-conversion ‘‘in addition’’ to dig-
ital must-carry, what they are asking for is obvious: carriage of both an analog and 
a  digital  version  of  the  same  signal.  But  dual  must-carry—and  multicast  must- 
carry,  another  one  of  the  broadcasters’  proposals—will  do  nothing  to  forward  the

of commercial and public television stations and cable program networks that offered HDTV pro-
gramming,  (2)  offering  value-added  DTV  programming  that  would  create  an  incentive  for  con-
sumers  to  purchase  DTV  sets,  (3)  placing  orders  for  integrated  HD  set-top  boxes  with  digital 
connectors, and (4) providing these boxes to customers who requested them.

digital  transition  and  harms  consumers,  cable  operators,  and  cable  programmers 
alike. 

The  broadcasters’  attempts  to  appropriate  additional  channel  capacity  on  cable 
systems through dual and multicast must-carry will harm consumers by slowing the 
deployment  of  broadband  and  a  host  of  other  new  digital  services.  The  reason  is 
simple: these services—such as 100+ megabits per second Internet access, VoIP tele-
phone  service,  and  digital  programming  tiers—all  compete  for  a  finite  amount  of 
space  on  cable  systems.  The  more  the  broadcasters  get,  the  less  capacity  there  is 
for innovative new applications sought by our customers. 

Awarding  the  broadcasters  dual  or  multicast  must-carry  rights  would  do  nothing 
to  further  ensure  the  viability  of  programming  from  a  multiplicity  of  sources.  It 
would,  however,  use  valuable  capacity  on  cable  systems  that  would  otherwise  be 
available  to  cable  operators  and  non-broadcast  cable  program  networks  to  offer  the 
array  of  services  that  provides  the  greatest  value  to  consumers.  Both  dual  must- 
carry and multicast must-carry are at odds with fundamental First Amendment and 
Fifth Amendment rights, and do not pass muster from either a public policy or legal 
standpoint. 

However,  this  committee  can  discharge  its  responsibilities  and  advance  public 
safety  without  wading  into  this  morass.  Current  law,  which  gives  broadcasters  the 
right  to  mandatory  carriage  of  their  primary  digital  video  stream  after  the  transi-
tion  is  complete  and  the  broadcasters  are  transmitting  exclusively  in  digital,  pre-
sumes a world in which the vast majority of consumers have digital televisions. An 
early return of the spectrum before most customers have purchased TVs with digital 
tuner  changes  that  picture  and  requires  a  little  flexibility.  If  you  adopt  our  down- 
conversion  proposal,  you  can  guarantee  that  66  million  cable  households  will  have 
access to the same programming the day after the transition as the day before. You 
will also allow the cable industry to continue to rollout broadband services and serve 
greater numbers of customers with digital and high definition programming. 
The  Cable  Industry  Is  Leading  the  Broader  National  Transition  to  the 

Digital Age 

In  the  United  States,  the  broadcasters’  transition  from  analog  to  digital  is  only 
a  small  part  of  the  larger  digital  transition  that  is  occurring  in  every  area  of  our 
Nation’s  economy.  Since  1996,  when  Congress  enabled  cable’s  investment  in  new 
technology  and  programming  by  substantially  reducing  regulation,  cable  operators 
have nearly rebuilt their facilities.2 With an investment of almost $100 billion, oper-
ators have replaced coaxial cable with fiber optic technology, and installed new dig-
ital  equipment  in  homes  and  system  headends,  thus  enabling  the  transmission  of 
voice, video, and Internet services in digital format. As a result, cable customers are 
already  enjoying  a  full  complement  of  digital  programming  and  advanced  informa-
tion services independently of the broadcasters’ conversion to digital. 

For example, cable customers can purchase digital programming tiers that include 
a  diverse  array  of  video  networks  and  commercial-free  music  channels.  Digital  cus-
tomers  also  have  access  to  video-on-demand  programming,  digital  video  recording, 
and  enhanced  electronic  program  guides.  These  features  allow  programs  to  be 
viewed at the customer’s convenience and at a time of the customer’s choosing. They 
also  allow  cable  subscribers  to  block  access  to  programming  they  do  not  want  their 
children  or  households  to  see.  All  of  cable’s  digital  services  can  be  enjoyed  by  con-
sumers  with  analog  TV  sets  who  use  digital  set-top  boxes  that  convert  digital  sig-
nals  to  analog.  More  innovative  interactive  video  services  are  on  the  way,  in  addi-
tion  to  the  Internet  and  digital  telephone  services  that  are  already  attracting  large 
numbers of customers. 

Cable  customers  with  high  definition  TV  (HDTV)  sets  have  even  more  options.3 
They can receive a wide selection of programming transmitted in high definition, in-
cluding 23 HD cable networks that transmit much of their programming in high def-
inition.4 In  addition,  cable  operators  are  now  voluntarily  carrying  the  digital  chan-

2 In  return  for  deregulation,  the  cable  industry  promised  Congress  and  American  consumers 
that it would provide: (1) facilities-based competition to the telephone companies, and (2) a new 
generation of advanced information and video services—both of which we have done. 

3 The cable industry is rapidly rolling out high definition programming. As of January 1, 2005, 
cable  companies  had  launched  high  definition  television  service  on  systems  passing  92  million 
homes. At least one cable operator in all of the top 100 markets now offers HDTV, and HD over 
cable is available in 184 of the 210 U.S. television markets.

nels  of  a  substantial  number  of  over-the-air  broadcast  stations  in  addition  to  those 
stations’ analog signals—either through retransmission consent agreements with in-
dividual commercial stations 5 or voluntary initiatives such as cable’s recent carriage 
agreement with public television stations.6 Significantly, cable’s contractual carriage 
agreement  with  public  television  stations  was  reached  through  private  negotia-
tions—not Federal legislation or FCC regulations. 
Cable’s Carriage of Broadcast Signals Today 

The  vast  majority  of  cable  customers  have  analog  television  sets,  and  most  of 
those  sets—as  in  over-the-air  households—are  not  equipped  with  digital  set-top 
boxes.7 Today,  cable  operators  provide  the  analog  signals  of  virtually  all  local  tele-
vision stations, which can be viewed by all customers—those with and without dig-
ital boxes, and those with and without digital television sets. In addition, operators 
provide the digital signals of some, but not all, broadcast stations—especially those 
that  provide  compelling  digital  programming  that  is  likely  to  enhance  the  value  of 
cable service for the growing number of customers with high definition sets. 

Cable’s  current  carriage  practices  fully  comply  with  what  both  the  marketplace 
and  the  ‘‘must-carry’’  rules  dictate.  Existing  law  requires  cable  operators  to  carry 
the  analog  signals  of  all  ‘‘must-carry’’  broadcast  stations  during  the  digital  transi-
tion,  while  making  carriage  of  the  digital  signals  optional  and  subject  to  ‘‘retrans-
mission  consent’’  agreements  with  broadcasters.  The  FCC  has  recognized  that  re-
quiring ‘‘dual carriage’’ of the analog and digital signals of all must-carry stations— 
regardless  of  whether  the  digital  programming  is  valuable  to  the  cable  households 
capable  of  viewing  it  on  their  TV  sets—would  do  nothing  to  further  the  purposes 
of the must-carry requirements, or the digital transition while unduly burdening the 
First Amendment rights of cable operators and programmers. 

This sensible balance, which serves the interests of must-carry broadcasters, cable 
operators,  cable  programmers,  and  cable  customers  alike,  can  be  preserved  without 
any  disruption  to  cable  customers  after  broadcasters  stop  transmitting  analog  sig-
nals—with one key adjustment. Current law requires cable operators to carry must- 
carry signals without ‘‘material degradation.’’ The FCC has interpreted this to mean 
that—after  the  transition,  when  broadcasters  are  transmitting  only  in  digital—‘‘a 
broadcast  signal  delivered  in  HDTV  must  be  carried  in  HDTV.’’ 8 This  ‘‘no  material 
degradation’’  requirement  makes  sense  if—as  is  the  case  under  current  law—the 
transition  to  digital-only  broadcasting  does  not  occur  until  most  households  are 
equipped  to  receive  digital  signals  on  their  television  sets.  However,  if  Congress  is 
going  to  impose  a  ‘‘hard  date’’  before  most  consumers  have  digital  sets  or  set-top 
boxes,  then  the  requirement  to  transmit  the  broadcasters’  digital  signals  in  ‘‘un-de-
graded’’  digital  format  will  be  costly  and  disruptive  for  cable  customers  who  do  not 
have  digital  TVs  or  set-top  boxes,  i.e.,  most  of  our  subscribers.  It  will  require  them 
to acquire digital sets or set-top boxes to continue watching the same broadcast pro-
gramming that they watch today. 

To prevent this costly disruption, Congress should allow cable operators to ‘‘down- 
convert’’ the digital signals of must-carry broadcasters to analog at the headend and 
provide  the  primary  video  programming  stream  of  those  down-converted  signals  to 
cable  homes  in  lieu  of  the  primary  digital  video  stream.  This  will  ensure  that  all 
cable households can receive the programming provided by those must-carry broad-
casters without having to purchase digital television sets or digital set-top boxes. 

Households  with  HDTV  sets  would,  of  course,  be  able  to  watch  the  increasing 
number  of  HD  channels,  as  they  do  now.  I  would  note  that  cable  operators  would 
still  have  every  incentive  to  voluntarily  provide  the  digital  signal—as  they  fre-
quently  do  today—in  addition  to  the  down-converted  analog  signal  if  the  digital 

5 As  of  January  1,  2005,  cable  operators  voluntarily  carried  504  digital  broadcast  signals—a 

66 percent increase over the 304 stations carried in December 2003. 

6 On  January  31,  2005,  NCTA  reached  agreement  with  the  Association  of  Public  Television 
Stations  (APTS)  to  ensure  that  the  digital  programming  offered  by  local  public  TV  stations  is 
carried on systems serving the vast majority of cable subscribers across the Nation. The boards 
of NCTA, APTS, and PBS ratified the agreement on February 4, 2005. 

7 There are approximately 172 million television sets in the 66 million cable households across 
the  country.  26  million  cable  homes  subscribe  to  digital  service,  but  not  all  digital  households 
have digital boxes on all their TVs. This means that there are approximately 28 million analog 
TVs  in  digital  homes  that  will  require  boxes  after  the  transition.  If  one  adds  these  28  million 
sets  to  the  approximately  106  million  analog  TVs  in  homes  with  only  analog  cable  service  (41 
million), there are a total of around 134 million analog TV sets in cable homes that will require 
digital  boxes  in  order  to  get  digital  service.  The  cost  of  deploying  134  million  set-top  boxes  is 
$9  billion  for  a  simple  $67  digital-to-analog  box  and  $29  billion  for  a  $200  interactive  digital 
cable box.

version  were  uniquely  compelling  and  attractive  to  customers  with  digital  and 
HDTV equipment. As a result, a ‘‘hard date’’ transition to digital broadcasting would 
be seamless and non-disruptive for cable customers. 

Today,  we  offer  analog  to  our  analog  customers,  analog  and  digital  to  our  digital 
customers,  and  increasingly  the  opportunity  for  customers  with  high  definition  sets 
to watch a growing number of channels in high definition. In addition, many of our 
operators  have  already  announced  their  own  plans  to  simulcast  analog  channels  in 
digital.  And  what  is  true  today  will  still  be  true  the  day  after  the  transition  under 
our proposal. In the meantime, increasing numbers of our subscribers will continue 
to  switch  to  digital  services,  and  many  of  them  will  become  high  definition  sub-
scribers.  We  believe  our  proposal  minimizes  costs  and  inconvenience  to  consumers, 
and allows you as policy-makers not to have to worry about disrupting anyone who 
is a cable customer—and to do so at no cost to the government. 

We are pleased to see that the SAVE LIVES Act (S. 1268), introduced by Senators 
McCain  and  Lieberman,  appears  to  recognize  the  consumer  benefits  of  permitting 
down-conversion in lieu of digital carriage.9 While we have concerns about the bill’s 
‘‘convert  one-convert  all’’  obligation  on  any  operator  who  chooses  to  down-convert, 
the  bill  recognizes  that  this  obligation  should  end  when  it  is  no  longer  necessary 
to  ensure  the  continued  ability  of  audiences  for  foreign-language  and  religious  tele-
vision  broadcast  stations  to  view  the  signals  of  such  stations.  Finally,  the  bill  also 
recognizes  that  only  a  single  digital  program  stream  from  each  broadcaster  should 
be  entitled  to  carriage  on  a  cable  operator’s  basic  service  tier.  Thus,  S.  1268  offers 
a sound starting point for crafting a digital transition bill that best serves the inter-
ests of consumers and is fair to all of the affected industries. 
Dual  and  Multicasting  Must  Carry  Are  Likely  To  Be  Found  Unconstitu-

tional 

A. Down-Conversion and Dual Carriage 

Cable operators seek authority to fulfill their must-carry obligations in some cases 
by  carrying  a  down-converted  analog  signal  in  lieu  of  a  broadcaster’s  digital  signal. 
Some  commercial  broadcasters  are  insisting,  however,  that  cable  operators  be  per-
mitted to carry down-converted analog versions of their digital signals only in addi-
tion  to—not  instead  of—the  original  signals.  This  would  effectively  impose  a  dual 
carriage  obligation  if  operators  wanted  to  make  broadcast  signals  readily  available 
to  the  majority  of  their  customers  who  do  not  have  digital  equipment—as  they 
would  obviously  have  to  do.  Any  such  dual  carriage  requirement  would  impose  un-
tenable  burdens  on  cable  operators  and  programmers  alike  and  should  be  rejected. 
• By preempting an excessive amount of capacity on cable systems, dual carriage 
would interfere with the ability of cable operators to offer consumers the broad-
est array of programming, and to deploy broadband and innovative digital serv-
ices. 
• Dual must-carry would be especially unfair to non-broadcast program networks 
(such  as  A&E’s  Biography  Channel,  C–SPAN,  Discovery  Kids  Channel,  Hall-
mark Channel, The Outdoor Channel, Oxygen, Sı´ TV, and TV One), which have 
no  guarantee  that  their  programming  will  be  carried  in  analog  or  digital  for-
mat—much less in both. 

As  the  FCC  has  determined,  imposing  such  burdens  on  cable  operators’  and  pro-
grammers’ speech would raise serious Constitutional problems, because it would not 
advance  the  governmental  interests  identified  by  the  Supreme  Court  as  justifica-
tions for ‘‘must-carry’’ rules—or any other valid government interest. Specifically, 

• Dual  carriage  will  do  nothing  to  preserve  or  enhance  the  availability  or  quality 
of  broadcast  signals  available  to  over-the-air  viewers.  To  the  contrary,  guaran-
teed carriage of a broadcaster’s signal in analog and digital format will diminish 
the broadcaster’s incentive to provide programming that is uniquely compelling 
in its digital format, e.g., HDTV. 
• Dual carriage will do nothing to promote the dissemination of information from 
a  multiplicity  of  sources  since  the  two  channels  would  simply  be  digital  and 
down-converted analog versions of the same programming. Indeed, it would have 
the opposite effect: it would decrease the multiplicity of voices by granting pref-
erential  treatment  to  one  broadcaster  over  different  programming  from  other 
sources. 

9 While  S.  1268  establishes  a  baseline  digital  carriage  requirement  with  respect  to  any  must- 
carry station that relinquishes its analog spectrum, it gives cable operators the flexibility to con-
vert digital signals to analog at the headend ‘‘notwithstanding’’ this baseline requirement.

26 

• Dual  carriage  will  do  nothing  to  promote  the  purchase  of  digital  sets  by  con-
sumers  or  set-top  boxes  by  cable  operators  since  cable  systems  already  provide 
a  broad  array  of  digital  and  high  definition  programming  (both  broadcast  and 
non-broadcast).  In  these  circumstances,  the  additional  carriage  of  must-carry 
broadcast stations in digital format will provide no additional incentive to cable 
customers to purchase digital equipment. 

Not surprisingly, the FCC has voted twice (by a margin of 5–0 in 2005) that dual 
carriage would raise serious First Amendment problems, and should not be imposed 
under the current must-carry statute. Changing the law to allow cable operators to 
carry  down-converted  analog  versions  in  lieu  of  digital  versions  of  must-carry  sig-
nals  makes  good  sense.  But  changing  the  law  in  a  manner  that  effectively  requires 
cable operators to carry must-carry signals in both digital and analog formats would 
not only be counterproductive and contrary to the public interest, it would be uncon-
stitutional as well. 
B. Multicast Must Carry 

If  Congress  grants  cable  the  authority  to  fulfill  its  must-carry  obligations  by  car-
rying down-converted analog signals, all cable customers will be able to watch those 
signals—the  same  channels  of  programming  that  we  are  required  to  carry  today— 
without  having  to  acquire  additional  set-top  boxes  or  new  digital  television  sets. 
Meanwhile,  cable  operators  would  continue,  voluntarily,  and  pursuant  to  retrans-
mission  consent,  to  carry  additional  digital  signals  from  broadcasters  who  provide 
compelling  high  definition  and  multicast  programming  that  is  attractive  to  cable 
customers. 

But commercial broadcasters are continuing to urge Congress to force cable opera-
tors  to  carry  every  digital  multicast  channel  from  every  must-carry  broadcast  sta-
tion. 10 Never  mind  that  they  failed  to  persuade  the  FCC  that  such  a  requirement 
was  in  any  way  necessary  to  preserve  the  viability  and  availability  of  over-the-air 
broadcast  stations,  or  that  it  would  promote  the  availability  of  broadcast  program-
ming  from  a  variety  of  sources.  The  broadcasters  also  failed  to  persuade  the  FCC 
that  such  a  requirement  could  be  implemented  without  burdening  cable  operators 
and  programmers  in  a  way  that  raised  serious  Constitutional  problems.  But  broad-
casters  are  now  hoping  that  the  same  arguments  that  failed  to  persuade  the  Com-
mission will somehow prove persuasive here. 

There  is  no  reason  why  they  should.  A  multicast  must-carry  requirement  would 
force cable operators to use channel capacity that they spent nearly $100 billion de-
ploying  (so  that  they  could  offer  compelling  programming  and  advanced  broadband 
services)  to  carry  the  broadcasters’  multicast  programming  instead.  While  this 
trade-off  would  reduce  the  value  of  cable  service  to  cable  customers,  it  would  do 
nothing to preserve the availability—and would be more likely to diminish the qual-
ity—of over-the-air television from a multiplicity of sources. 

First of all, we should put to rest the notion, which the broadcasters keep resusci-
tating,  that  cable  operators  have  anticompetitive  reasons  for  refusing  to  carry  the 
broadcasters’ multicast programming—even if consumers find it attractive. In 1992, 
when Congress enacted the current must-carry provisions, it worried that such dis-
crimination  might  occur  with  respect  to  the  broadcasters’  analog  signals.  But  when 
the  Supreme  Court  narrowly  upheld  (5–4)  the  Constitutionality  of  analog  must- 
carry,  a  majority  of  the  Court  found  that  this  was  not  a  supportable  justification 
for the rules.11 

Whatever  fears  Congress  may  have  had  in  1992,  the  subsequent  launch  of  two 
vigorous  and  successful  national  direct  broadcast  satellite  (DBS)  services  has  re-
moved  any  likelihood  that  a  cable  operator  could  profitably  refuse  to  carry  a  pro-
gramming  service—broadcast  or  non-broadcast—that  would  attract  a  significant 
viewership  and  might  be  carried  by  its  competitors.  The  Supreme  Court  found  no 
basis  for  such  fears  in  1997,  and  today,  with  satellite  competition  stronger  than 
ever,  the  prospect  of  anticompetitive  conduct  by  cable  operators  is  even  more  re-
mote. As an argument for multicast must-carry, it is a red herring. 

In fact, where broadcasters are currently offering compelling digital content, cable 
operators are voluntarily agreeing to carry such programming. At present, cable op-
erators  have  agreed  to  carry  the  digital  signals  of  over  500  unique  broadcast  sta-
tions,  and  this  includes  not  only  HDTV  signals  but  also  multicast  streams.  Of 
course, operators continue to carry the broadcasters’ analog channels as well.

being circulated in Congress by the National Association of Broadcasters.

ring  in  part)  (‘‘I  join  the  opinion  of  the  Court  except  insofar  as  [it]  relies  on  an  anticompetitive 
rationale.’’)

• As  of  May  2005,  cable  operators  were  carrying  commercial  broadcasters’ 
multicast  programming  in  over  50  markets  ranging  from  many  of  the  Nation’s 
largest (including at least 7 of the top 10 markets) 12 to numerous small to mid- 
sized markets across the country. For example, in the Washington metropolitan 
area, Comcast is carrying WJLA’s local Weather Now channel (ABC) and WRC’s 
Weather  Plus  channel  (NBC),  as  well  as  WETA’s  Prime,  Kids,  and  Plus  chan-
nels (PBS). 

• In  January  2005,  NCTA  and  the  Association  of  Public  Television  Stations 
(APTS) entered into an agreement that ensures that local public television sta-
tions’  digital  programming—including  multicast  channels—is  carried  on  cable 
systems serving the vast majority of cable customers across the Nation. 

• Comcast has digital carriage agreements with public broadcasters in at least 45 
markets, and has reached digital multicast carriage agreements with a growing 
number  of  commercial  broadcasters  for  channels  that  Comcast  believes  bring 
value to its customers. 

• During  the  recent  NCAA  men’s  college  basketball  tournament,  CBS  stations  in 
a  dozen  markets  offered—and  cable  operators  agreed  to  carry—extra  games  on 
multicast channels. 

The Supreme Court found that the analog must-carry requirements were justified 
as  a  means  for  preserving  the  viability  of  over-the-air  broadcast  stations  and  the 
availability of programming from a multiplicity of sources. It found, after remanding 
the  matter  to  the  FCC  to  develop  an  extensive  evidentiary  record,13 that  non-car-
riage  of  a  broadcaster’s  single  analog  channel  would  threaten  the  viability  of  a  sig-
nificant  number  of  broadcasters,  and  therefore,  threaten  to  reduce  the  diversity  of 
programming  sources  available  over-the-air.  But  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that 
mandatory  carriage  of  multiple  program  streams  provided  by  every  broadcaster  is 
necessary to protect against such threats. 

Although the broadcasters persistently claim that a multicast must-carry require-
ment  is  essential  to  maintain  their  economic  viability,  they  have  not  produced  a 
shred of evidence demonstrating that this is the case. They certainly had ample op-
portunity  to  do  so  throughout  the  FCC’s  lengthy  rulemaking  proceeding.  Yet  the 
Commission found nothing in the record to support their claim: 

Unlike  in  the  analog  carriage  debate,  here  broadcasters  fail  to  substantiate 
their  claim  that  mandatory  multicasting  is  essential  to  ensure  station  carriage 
or  survival.  Broadcasters  argue  that  carriage  of  multicast  streams  is  essential 
to  help  them  develop  and  support  additional  programming  streams,  but  they 
have  not  made  the  case  on  the  current  record  that  these  additional  program-
ming  streams  are  essential  to  preserve  the  benefits  of  a  free,  over-the-air  tele-
vision  system  for  viewers.  Broadcasters  will  continue  to  be  afforded  must-carry 
for  their  main  video  programming  stream,  which  can  be  in  standard  definition 
or  high  definition,  and  any  additional  material  that  is  considered  program-re-
lated.  Broadcasters  can  also  rely  on  the  marketplace  working  without  manda-
tory  carriage  in  order  to  persuade  cable  systems  to  carry  additional  streams  of 
programming. There is evidence from the record, as well as news accounts, that 
cable  operators  are  voluntarily  carrying  the  multiple  streams  of  programming 
of  some  broadcast  stations,  including  public  television  stations,  that  are  cur-
rently  multicasting.  . . .  Under  these  circumstances,  the  interests  of  over-the- 
air television viewers appear to remain protected.14 

Indeed,  while  broadcast  groups  have  argued  that  multicast  carriage  is  especially 
vital to the survival of smaller and financially weaker broadcast stations, one inde-
pendent  broadcaster,  Entravision  Holdings,  LLC,  specifically  told  the  FCC  that  it 

12 In at least one additional top 10 television market, cable carried the multicast signal of the 

recent NCAA men college basketball tournament games. 

13 In  remanding  the  case,  the  Court  made  clear  that  it  is  not  sufficient  merely  to  assert  that 
must-carry rules are necessary to prevent some hypothetical harm: ‘‘That the Government’s as-
serted interests are important in the abstract does not mean, however, that the must-carry rules 
will  in  fact  advance  those  interests.  When  the  Government  defends  a  regulation  on  speech  as 
a means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms, it must do more than simply ‘posit 
the existence of the disease sought to be cured.’ Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC, 768 F. 2d 1434, 
1455 (CADC 1985). It must demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, 
and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.’’ Turner

and other similarly situated independent broadcasters have little to gain—and much 
to lose—from a multicast must-carry requirement. According to Entravision: 

Network-affiliated  broadcasters  have  characterized  multicast  services  as  an  in-
tegral component of the future business plans of broadcasters, and as indispen-
sable to a successful DTV transition and the continuing vitality of free over-the- 
air  television  service.  However,  while  digital  multicast  services  may  already  be 
a  reality  for  some  network  affiliates  with  the  programming  and  financial  re-
sources to advance and support such technology, independent stations simply do 
not  have  access  to  the  programming  or  the  capital  to  invest  in  such  technology 
at this time, or in the foreseeable future. 15 

As  a  result,  Entravision  noted  that  ‘‘. . . multicasting  will  simply  increase  the 
power of network-affiliated stations and further diminish the ability of independent 
broadcasters to make their voices heard.’’ 16 

As  this  broadcaster  suggests,  a  multicast  carriage  requirement  will  not  serve— 
and  may  actually  disserve—the  purpose  of  promoting  the  availability  of  program-
ming  from  a  variety  of  sources.  The  FCC  itself  found  it  hard  to  see  how  carriage 
of multiple streams from the same broadcast station could serve such a purpose: 

[B]ased on the current record, there is little to suggest that requiring cable op-
erators  to  carry  more  than  one  programming  stream  of  a  digital  television  sta-
tion  would  contribute  to  promoting  ‘‘the  widespread  dissemination  of  informa-
tion from a multiplicity of sources.’’ Under a single-channel must-carry require-
ment,  broadcasters  will  have  a  presence  on  cable  systems.  Adding  additional 
channels  of  the  same  broadcaster  would  not  enhance  source  diversity.  Further-
more,  programming  shifted  from  a  broadcaster’s  main  channel  to  the  same 
broadcaster’s  multicast  channel  would  not  promote  diversity  of  information 
sources.  Indeed,  mandatory  multicast  carriage  would  arguably  diminish  the 
ability of other, independent voices to be carried on the cable system. 17 

Nor  would  a  multicast  carriage  requirement  do  anything  to  promote  the  digital 
transition  by  accelerating  the  acquisition  and  use  of  digital  equipment—television 
sets  or  set-top  boxes—by  cable  customers.  Cable  customers  already  have  access  to 
hundreds  of  channels  of  programming,  including  many  channels  of  high  definition 
programming. It is unlikely that the availability of additional digital multicast pro-
gramming  will  persuade  any  additional  customers  to  acquire  digital  sets  or  set-top 
boxes. 

Since a multicast carriage requirement would not serve the purposes that justified 
the analog must-carry provisions—or any other important government policy—there 
is  no  basis,  Constitutional  or  otherwise,  for  imposing  the  burdens  of  such  a  require-
ment on cable operators and programmers. 

But  that  does  not  deter  the  NAB,  which  asserts  that  mandatory  carriage  of 
multicast streams would not require any more capacity than is required of cable op-
erators  under  current  law,  and  would  pose  no  Constitutional  problems.  The  broad-
casters’ claim is wrong, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. 

First,  if  Congress  adopts  a  hard  date  that  ends  the  transition  before  most  cable 
customers have purchased digital television sets or digital set-top boxes, a multicast 
requirement  almost  certainly  will  take  up  more  capacity  than  is  currently  used  to 
carry  broadcast  stations.  This  is  because  cable  operators  will  need  to  down-convert 
and carry each broadcaster’s primary video signal in analog format, using the same 
6  MHz  they  use  today  to  carry  such  stations.  Any  requirement  to  carry  additional 
digital multicast signals will add to this burden on cable’s capacity. 

Second, ‘‘current law’’ contemplates that broadcasters must return their free ana-
log  spectrum  and  that  they  are  entitled  to  carriage  of  their  one  ‘‘primary’’  digital 
video signal after the transition. Adding a multicast carriage requirement to this ob-
ligation  obviously  increases  the  burden  on  a  cable  system’s  capacity,  and  restricts 
an  operator’s  ability  to  deploy  significant  new  services  and  applications  that  en-
hance the value of cable service to local consumers. 

In  any  event,  the  burden  of  a  must-carry  requirement,  for  Constitutional  pur-
poses, is not simply the physical amount of channel capacity an operator is required 
to  devote  to  must-carry,  but  the  extent  to  which  must-carry  obligations:  (1)  intrude 
on  a  cable  operator’s  editorial  discretion  to  use  his  system’s  capacity  in  a  manner

that  best  serves  viewers,  and  (2)  discriminate  against  cable  programmers  who  do 
not  have  the  broadcasters’  preferential,  guaranteed  access  to  channels  on  a  cable 
system. 

As I have mentioned, cable operators have invested nearly $100 billion in facility 
upgrades  to  bring  a  variety  of  new  digital  broadband  services  to  their  customers. 
Each channel that would have to be used to carry a must-carry stream of broadcast 
programming in lieu of some other service imposes an incremental burden that can 
only be justified if it advances an important government interest. 

Any multicast programming that is likely to be attractive to viewers will be—and 
is  already  being—carried  by  cable  operators.  But  requiring  cable  operators  to  carry 
every multicast stream of every broadcast station would impose significant burdens 
on the speech rights of cable operators and cable program networks, and would dis-
serve  the  interests  of  cable  customers.  Imposing  a  multicast  requirement  would 
raise serious Constitutional problems under the First Amendment. A multicast car-
riage  requirement,  like  dual  must-carry,  would  also  raise  serious  Fifth  Amendment 
problems.  It  would  result  in  the  permanent,  physical  occupation  of  a  substantial 
portion of a cable operator’s system without just compensation—indeed, without any 
compensation at all. 
Conclusion 

Congress  should  reject  the  broadcasters’  renewed  calls  for  digital  must-carry,  in-
cluding  dual  must-carry  and  multicast  must-carry.  When  the  broadcasters  suggest 
that  they  are  not  asking  for  dual  must-carry  but  want  ‘‘either/or’’  carriage  or  car-
riage  of  ‘‘just’’  their  digital  signal,  policymakers  should  realize  that  these  proposals 
are  tantamount  to  dual  must-carry.  In  what  is  still  primarily  an  analog  television 
world, cable companies cannot plausibly be expected to cutoff the bulk of their video 
customers  by  carrying  only  digital  signals  during  the  broadcasters’  transition  to 
DTV. 

If  Congress  decides  that  the  analog  spectrum  needs  to  be  returned  before  most 
television  viewers  are  equipped  to  receive  digital  signals,  there  is  a  way  of  mini-
mizing  consumer  costs  and  service  disruptions.  Instead  of  permitting  operators  to 
carry down-converted signals in addition to mandated carriage of the digital signals 
transmitted  by  must-carry  broadcasters,  one  need  only  to  allow  carriage  of  down- 
converted signals in lieu of the digital signals, while giving operators the discretion 
to carry both the down-converted and digital versions of the signal. Mandating dual 
carriage  or  multicast  carriage  would  do  nothing  further  to  advance  any  legitimate 
public  policy  objective,  and  would  only  impose  Constitutionally  impermissible  bur-
dens on cable operators and cable program networks.

I’m  also  Vice  Chairman  of  the  American  Cable  Association, 
whose  member  companies  provide  cable  and  broadband  service  in 
rural areas in every state represented on the Committee. 

I believe you stand at a historic moment when we shift from the 
analog  world  to  the  exciting  digital  future.  As  you  consider  how 
best  to  address  the  DTV  transition,  there  are  two  separate,  but 
intertwined,  sets  of  issues:  first,  the  cost  and  the  technical  chal-
lenges  with  completing  the  transition,  and,  second,  the  problems 
with retransmission consent and programming practices. 

For  the  transition  to  be  a  success,  it  must  work  for  all  Ameri-
cans, including those in more rural areas. The cost of the transition 
will  have  a  disproportionate  impact  on  rural  customers  and  sys-
tems.  ACA  has  some  ideas  on  how  to  deal  with  this,  and  I’d  like 
to highlight two. 

First,  that  cable  operators  need  to  have  the  flexibility  to  down- 
convert  digital  signals  without  the  burden  of  mandated  dual  car-
riage.  Smaller  systems  need  this  flexibility,  because  they  cannot 
support the costly infrastructure necessary to provide these redun-
dant  channels.  What  may  be  more  compelling  for  you  is  that,  by 
facilitating down-conversion, it will minimize the cost of the transi-
tion  by  ensuring  that  the  government  will  not  have  to  put  a  box 
in every TV in every customer’s home. 

And,  second,  satellite-delivered  local-to-local  signals  need  to  be 
available  to  rural  cable  operators  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis.  In 
some  markets,  digital  signals  will  not  be  strong  enough  to  reach 
the headend, meaning that viewers who previously could receive an 
analog  signal  are  now  left  without  a  picture,  a  situation  known  as 
the ‘‘digital cliff.’’ The price of not fixing this problem is that many 
consumers  in  compliant  systems  will  find  themselves  staring  at 
blank TV screens. 

As  for  the  second  set  of  issues,  outdated  retransmission  consent 
and  programming  rules  must  be  addressed  during  this  transition. 
Many of us are already seeing abusive behavior by big broadcasters 
as  they  exploit  government-granted  powers  for  their  benefit.  My 
company,  like  many  ACA  member  companies,  have  invested  mil-
lions  of  dollars  to  do  its  part  to  embrace  the  transition  by  upgrad-
ing  systems  to  launch  DTV,  only  to  have  some  broadcasters  use 
their  market  power  to  hold  up  retransmission  consent.  Some  are 
demanding unreasonably high fees just to grant access to DTV sig-
nals,  and,  incredibly,  others  will  not  even  have  the  courtesy  to  re-
turn our calls as we seek to carry those signals. 

And  it  gets  worse,  some  broadcasters  are  now  demanding  sub-
stantial cash payments from smaller cable operators. Typically, I’m 
hearing  demands  of  50  cents  to  a  dollar  more  per  channel,  which 
adds  up  to  rate  increases  of  two  to  five  dollars  per  month  for  each 
subscriber  for  the  same  broadcast  signals  they  receive  today.  In 
some  markets,  these  demands  are  only  made  of  the  small  opera-
tors.  Big  cable  companies  are  paying  nothing,  while  rural  cus-
tomers  are  being  gouged  for  cash.  The  sole  reason  this  can  occur, 
broadcasters  have  market  power  granted  to  them  by  the  laws  and 
regulations  of  the  analog  era.  I  believe  the  intent  of  the  retrans-
mission consent laws were to protect localism, not to promote prof-
iteering.  This  situation  occurs  for  many  reasons,  but,  most  impor-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

31 

tantly,  broadcasters  use  exclusivity  to  block  cable  operators  from 
obtaining network signals at a lower cost. 

Fortunately,  there  are  solutions  to  this  problem,  and  I  will  sug-
gest  three  here.  One,  eliminate  exclusivity  when  a  broadcaster 
elects  retransmission  consent  and  seeks  additional  consideration 
for  carriage.  Two,  prohibit  any  party,  including  a  network,  from 
preventing  a  broadcast  station  from  granting  retransmission  con-
sent.  And,  three,  to  codify  the  retransmission  consent  conditions 
imposed on the NewsCorp/DIRECTV merger to apply to all retrans-
mission consent agreements. 

In  summary,  the  retransmission  consent  and  broadcast  exclu-
sivity  regulations  have  been  used  by  the  networks  and  stations  to 
raise rates and force unwanted programming onto consumers. This 
must stop. But it won’t, unless Congress acts. 

Finally,  I  would  encourage  you  to  at  least  pierce  the  program-
ming  veil  of  secrecy  by  authorizing  the  FCC  to  obtain  specific  pro-
gramming contracts and rate information in order to develop a pro-
gramming  price  index.  The  PPI  would  be  a  simple,  yet  effective, 
way to gauge how programming rates rise and fall, while still pro-
tecting the proprietary elements of individual contracts. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  committee  stands  today  at  the  threshold  of 
a new digital world, but the challenges are many and the risks are 
great. Clearly, rural America and its service providers have unique 
financial  and  geographic  challenges  to  face  when  making  this  con-
version.  Additionally,  outdated  regulatory  structures  that  raise 
rates  and  force  programming  on  our  constituents  must  be  aban-
doned. 

I  hope  that  you  will  be  able  to  address  both  of  these  problems, 

and I appreciate the opportunity to testify on ACA’s views. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Knorr follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRICK KNORR, GENERAL MANAGER, SUNFLOWER 

BROADBAND; VICE CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CABLE ASSOCIATION (ACA) 

Introduction 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. 
My  name  is  Patrick  Knorr,  and  I  am  General  Manager  of  Sunflower  Broadband, 
an independent cable business based in Lawrence, Kansas, currently serving 35,000 
customers. My company provides cable television, digital cable, high-speed Internet, 
local  phone  service,  digital  video  recorders,  and  other  advanced  services  in  eight 
smaller systems and rural areas throughout Northeast Kansas. 

I  am  also  the  Vice  Chairman  of  the  American  Cable  Association.  ACA  represents 
nearly 1,100 smaller and medium-sized independent cable businesses. These compa-
nies  do  one  thing—serve  our  customers,  who  are  found  in  areas  the  bigger  compa-
nies don’t serve. ACA members don’t own programming or content; nor are they run 
by  the  large  media  companies.  Collectively,  ACA  members  serve  nearly  8  million 
customers, mostly in smaller markets. Our members serve customers in every state, 
particularly those of this committee. 

I believe you stand at an historic moment, when we shift from the 1970s-era poli-
cies  of  the  analog  world  to  the  exciting  and  enticing  future  that  the  digital  revolu-
tion  can  provide.  All  of  us  here  today  want  our  constituents  and  customers  to  re-
ceive the best in advanced, high-speed, digital services. The transition to digital tele-
vision  is  an  important  step  in  the  right  direction.  But  at  the  same  time,  all  of  us 
here today want to ensure that no one is left behind as we actually move from ana-
log to digital. 

As  we  look  today  at  ideas  and  proposals  concerning  the  transition  to  digital  tele-

vision, there are two realities this Committee must take into account. 

The  first  reality  is  that  the  transition  to  digital  television  is  both  a  question  of 
technology and of public policy—a reality recognized by the existence of this hearing 
and the very necessity of a DTV bill. Many very important and relevant public pol-

32 

icy issues exist today concerning the digital pipe and the content that flows through 
it.  Issues  such  as  ‘‘rising  cable  and  satellite  rates,’’  ‘‘media  consolidation,’’  ‘‘inde-
cency,’’ ‘‘retransmission consent abuse,’’ ‘‘family programming tiers’’ and the ‘‘Digital 
Divide,’’ cannot be viewed as separate from the DTV transition. In fact, these policy 
issues  are  the  central  focus  of  your  constituents  and  our  customers.  Moving  a  lim-
ited  DTV  bill  will  only  postpone  and  exacerbate  marketplace,  media,  programming, 
and pricing problems that already exist back home in your districts. The transition 
from analog to digital, and the underlying need for legislation to facilitate that shift, 
provides you with the first appropriate opportunity to address these germane issues 
in a comprehensive manner, and I encourage you to take advantage of this moment. 
Digital platforms can provide consumers with a wondrous world of new and valu-
able  programming.  But  if  you  allow  the  old  rules  to  stay  in  place,  it  will  just  be 
more  of  the  same.  To  move  forward  on  just  one  technological  aspect  of  the  digital 
revolution without moving forward on the broader content and programming issues 
would  be  the  equivalent  of  putting  a  fancy  new  engine  in  a  rusty  old  car,  thus  se-
verely  limiting  how  far  and  how  fast  you  can  really  go.  To  provide  consumers  with 
the greatest benefit, it is imperative that you break with the past and recognize that 
some old ideas no longer serve the greater good. 

I  strongly  urge  this  committee  to  seize  this  moment  to  restore  the  balance  of 
power  between  programmers,  operators,  media  consortiums,  and  broadcasters.  In 
short, it’s time to recalibrate for the digital world so that each is subject to the cre-
ative power of competitive market forces and to the consumers they serve. 

Moving  on  to  the  second  reality,  DTV  transition  proposals  that  require  dual  car-
riage  of  broadcast  signals  will  threaten  ACA  members’  very  survival  and  ability  to 
provide  advanced  services  such  as  high-speed  Internet,  VoIP  and  VOD.  Unless  the 
specific  financial  realities  of  smaller,  independent  providers  are  addressed  in  any 
DTV bill, consumers and communities across America will lose access to signals and 
services they rely on today. In fact, what worries me is that without efforts to help 
these systems make the transition, many of the small businesses that provide video 
and  broadband  services  in  rural  America  will  cease  to  exist,  and  the  digital  divide 
will actually grow. 

Out  in  the  smaller  communities  ACA  members  serve,  literally  from  Alaska  to 
Maine,  Hawaii  and  Florida,  it  is  our  core  video  business  that  allows  us  to  finance 
and  provide  the  high-speed  services,  including  digital  television,  which  everyone 
wants  in  order  to  bridge  the  Digital  Divide.  It  is  independent  cable  companies  like 
mine  that  provide  broadband  services  to  small  towns  throughout  the  country.  Sat-
ellite  providers,  telephone  giants,  or  major  cable  companies—unlike  ACA’s  mem-
bers—are not rushing to serve these communities, and I can appreciate why. Large 
companies  will  never  come  rushing  into  these  communities  because  of  the  cost  and 
difficulty of providing service in rural America. The headlines you read about in the 
media  are  about  new  services  and  suites  of  services  offered  to  larger  communities. 
If  ACA  members’  video  service  cannot  survive,  I  can  assure  you  we  will  not  be 
around  to  offer  the  cable  modem  services  these  communities  need,  and  the  DTV 
services this committee wants. In short, video programming is not ‘‘just’’ about pro-
gramming  choices  and  rates,  but  it  is  also  the  foundation  upon  which  advanced 
services, including DTV, are built. 

As  a  result,  there  are  four  fundamental  and  specific  changes  that  must  be  made 
if your goal is to provide the greatest diversity of video, DTV and advanced services, 
and  to  ensure  that  all  consumers—even  in  smaller  markets  and  rural  areas—have 
access to them. The four changes are: 

1.  Ensure  that  consumers  in  smaller  markets  and  rural  areas  are  not  left  be-
hind  in  the  digital  transition.  Take  into  account  and  address  the  unique  finan-
cial,  technical,  and  operational  requirements  of  those  companies  that  will  be 
providing DTV service in rural America. 
2.  Update  and  change  the  current  retransmission  consent  rules  to  help  remedy 
the imbalance of power caused by media consolidation. 
3.  Correct  rules  that  allow  for  abusive  behavior  because  of  media  consolidation

What Needs To Be Changed and Why 
1. Ensure That Consumers in Smaller Markets and Rural Areas Are Not Left Behind 
in the Digital Transition—Take Into Account and Address the Unique Financial, 
Technical,  and  Operational  Requirements  of  Those  Companies  That  Will  Be 
Providing DTV Service in Rural America 

Several  current  DTV  legislative  proposals  would  require  cable  operators  to  carry 
the  primary  digital  signal  of  all  broadcast  stations,  but  allow  the  cable  operator  to 
also  simultaneously  down-convert  certain  commercial  and  educational  stations  to 
analog, and then require the cable operator to carry both digital and analog signals 
all on the broadcast basic tier. From the perspective of the independent cable opera-
tors  serving  rural  America  today,  this  is  no  choice  at  all  for  the  following  reasons: 
Dual  Carriage.  Independent  cable  operators  in  smaller  markets  and  rural  areas 
cannot  afford  the  transition  and  equipment  costs  to  transmit  solely  digital  signals. 
They  will  need  to  down-convert  digital  signals  to  analog  so  that  their  subscribers 
in smaller markets and rural America will have a signal to receive. If dual carriage 
is the only option, most small systems will be unable to comply because of the limi-
tations  of  their  systems  will  prevent  them  from  carrying  those  signals—the  actual 
carrying  capacity  of  the  pipe  into  the  home  will  be  too  small.  In  addition,  the  cost 
of just carrying the digital signal for most ACA members would be more than $1,000 
per  subscriber.  That’s  a  cost  that  many  smaller  systems  cannot  support.  Addition-
ally, such a solution would force every customer in my market to have a set-top box 
or  new  digital  television  set  for  every  TV  in  the  house.  In  short,  the  requirement 
for  dual  carriage  of  both  the  digital  and  analog  signal  will  impose  significant  addi-
tional unrecoverable costs, and siphon off precious bandwidth used today to offer ad-
vanced  communications  services  like  high-speed  Internet,  VoIP,  and  VOD,  to  name 
a few. 

Hard  Deadline.  Current  DTV  proposals  would  impose  a  hard  deadline  of  Decem-
ber  31,  2008,  when  all  analog  transmission  by  broadcast  stations  must  cease.  The 
‘‘hard  deadline’’  for  the  digital  transition  will  disproportionately  impact  ACA  mem-
bers in rural America and their subscribers in at least two ways: 

• Some  ACA  members  in  remote  areas  are  subject  to  the  ‘‘digital  cliff’’  effect. 
When  broadcasters  turn  off  their  analog  signal  these  members  will  be  unable 
to pick up any signal to retransmit to their subscribers because of the technical 
characteristics  of  the  digital  signal.  If  a  cable  operator  cannot  pick  up  the  dig-
ital  signal,  its  subscribers  are  even  less  likely  to  be  able  to  pick  up  the  off-air 
signal with a home antenna. 
• Cable  subscribers  in  rural  areas  are  less  able  to  afford  digital  receivers  or  con-

verters than subscribers in urban areas. 

Retransmission  consent.  As  previously  discussed,  some  broadcasters  are  already 
using  their  DTV  signal  as  a  lever  to  impose  more  tying  demands  and  higher  fees 
for  retransmission  consent  on  cable  operators.  In  some  cases,  some  of  the  largest 
broadcasters  have  ignored  ACA  members  request  for  DTV  retransmission  consent. 
When  a  broadcaster  refuses  to  grant  consent  to  a  smaller  operator,  or  demands  ex-
orbitant  fees  or  costly  tying  arrangements,  this  behavior  impedes  the  DTV  transi-
tion. The bill must address these problems to ensure the increased bandwidth avail-
able  in  the  digital  world  will  not  just  become  increased  opportunity  for  more  un-
wanted  programming  and  higher  rates  to  be  leveraged-down  to  consumers  in  rural 
America. 

Digital-to-analog  conversion.  ACA  members  support  the  concept  of  allowing  the 
digital-to-analog  conversion,  without  imposition  of  a  dual  carriage  requirement. 
Such  a  decision  would  allow  smaller  systems  to  minimize  the  disruption  to  their 
consumers  and  would  ensure  our  continued  viability.  Unfortunately,  current  DTV 
proposals  will  first  require  consumers  to  purchase  new  equipment.  Second,  these 
proposals  will  place  an  insurmountable  economic  burden  on  operators  by  forcing 
them  to  replace  their  networks.  (See  Exhibit  1)  The  simplest  solution  would  be  to 
give operators the flexibility to down-convert digital signals at the headend without 
the dual carry obligation. 

The  stark  reality  is  that  ACA  members,  without  changes  to  current  DTV  pro-
posals  that  reflect  their  unique  circumstances,  face  serious  financial  hardship.  This 
means  that  consumers  served  by  ACA  members  in  most  of  the  states  represented 
on  this  committee  may  lose  their  provider  and  all  of  the  advanced  services  these 
companies provide. 

Some  may  say  that  the  loss  in  the  marketplace  of  certain  providers  like  ACA 
members  is  simply  a  function  of  survival-of-the-fittest.  We  would  argue  that  rural 
America  deserves  competition  in  the  video  marketplace  just  like  the  rest  of  the 
country.  They  also  deserve  to  experience  the  advanced  services  that  bigger  entities

are  rushing  to  provide  in  more  populated  and  profitable  areas.  The  reality  is  that 
in  the  rural  markets  ACA  member  companies  serve  and  operate,  larger  cable  tele-
vision  providers  will  not  fill  in  the  service  gaps  if  ACA  members  are  forced  to  exit 
their business. 

Solutions  to  ensure  no  consumer,  community,  or  provider  are  left  behind  in  the 

DTV transition: 

• Provide the ability to down-convert digital signals to analog without the obliga-

tion for dual carriage; 

• Assist independent cable operators to upgrade facilities to avoid the digital cliff 
effect  and  to  be  able  to  receive  and  transmit  DTV  signals  to  their  consumers; 
• Allow  waivers  of  the  carry-one-carry-all  requirement  to  ease  the  burden  on 

smaller operators; 

• Make  adjustments  to  retransmission  consent  rules  and  exclusivity  regulations. 
ACA  and  its  members  understand  and  support  the  need  for  the  Committee  to 
move  swiftly  to  recapture  analog  spectrum  for  other  noble  purposes.  However,  we 
strongly caution the Committee to consider the real possibility of leaving consumers, 
and providers in smaller markets and rural America, out in the cold with no choices, 
no signals and lost services. We hope to work with the Committee to develop a DTV 
transition  bill  that  will  recognize  the  unique  circumstances  faced  by  providers  and 
consumers in smaller markets and rural areas so that the DTV transition will take 
place  in  positive  ways  for  all  consumers,  not  just  those  located  in  populated  areas. 
2.  Current  Retransmission  Consent  Rules  Must  Be  Updated  To  Help  Remedy  the 

Imbalance of Power Caused By Media Consolidation 

The  current  retransmission  consent  and  broadcast  exclusivity  laws  and  regula-
tions limit consumer choice, and impede independent cable operators’ ability to com-
pete  in  smaller  markets  and  rural  America  by  permitting  distant  media  conglom-
erates  to  charge  monopoly  prices  for  programming.  This  situation  must  not  be  car-
ried forward into the post-DTV world. 

Current  laws  and  regulations  allow  broadcasters  to  combine  retransmission  con-
sent  and  market  exclusivity  into  a  monopolistic  hammer.  Both  of  these  rules  were 
created  to  preserve  local  broadcasting,  but  now  large  media  companies  use  those 
rules  to  hold  localism  hostage  to  increase  profits,  and  gain  wide  distribution  for 
niche  programming  like  SoapNet  and  more  recently  LOGO,  a  gay-themed  Viacom 
Network. These same practices that were used with analog broadcasting are already 
being applied to the digital world, accelerating the problem. 

Across  America  our  association  members  and  their  customers  are  seeing  early 
signs  that  broadcasters  are  using  this  leverage  to  lean  excessively  on  independent 
cable  operators  to  extract  cash.  ACA  member’s  systems  usually  serve  only  a  small 
fraction  of  the  households  in  any  DMA  and  have  no  leverage  in  negotiations  with 
broadcasters. Collectively our ACA members serve no more than 8 percent of all tel-
evision  households  and  most  of  rural  America.  We  estimate  that  this  year  broad-
casters will leverage retransmission consent rules to extract an additional $1 billion 
from consumers served by ACA members for the ‘‘privilege’’ to receive free over-the- 
air  signals.  The  average  increase  in  basic  cable  rates  as  a  result  could  well  be  $2– 
$5 per subscriber per month! Remember, for the consumer, they will not experience 
any improvement in service, nor receive any new programming despite being forced 
to pay this increase. 

And  broadcasters  don’t  only  demand  cash  for  the  right  to  carry  their  local  tele-
vision stations. Some members of the largest media conglomerates require our cable 
companies  to  carry  affiliated  satellite  programming  in  local  systems,  and  even  in 
systems  outside  of  the  member’s  local  broadcast  market.  In  this  way,  ownership  of 
a broadcast license is used to force carriage of, and payment for, affiliated program-
ming  by  consumers  who  do  not  even  receive  the  broadcast  signal  at  issue.  These 
forced  carriage  requirements  are  also  responsible  for  forcing  on  some  of  the  most 
objectionable  and  indecent  content  on  television  today,  such  as  SpikeTV,  F/X,  and 
Soap Net, among many others. 

Unless  this  Committee  addresses  these  issues,  price  increases  from  broadcaster 
demands  for  cash  and  additional  channels  will  continue  unabated  in  the  digital 
world. In fact, increased bandwidth will only add fuel to this fire. Large media com-
panies  are  using  the  free  spectrum  licenses  granted  by  the  government  for  local 
broadcasting to pad margins and to leverage often questionable nationally delivered 
content. How those licenses are used is fundamentally part of Congress’s obligation 
in  managing  the  transition  of  licenses  from  analog  to  digital.  Congress  created  the 
retransmission  consent  laws  in  1992,  to  protect  localism  and  must  change  them  in

2005,  to  protect  consumers  from  the  consequences  of  media  consolidation  in  a  new 
digital world. 

Broadcasters  and  programmers  get  away  with  these  abuses  today  because  the 
pricing of retransmission consent does not occur in a competitive market. Under the 
current regulatory scheme, media conglomerates and major affiliate groups are free 
to  demand  monopoly  ‘‘prices’’  for  retransmission  consent,  while  blocking  access  to 
readily available lower cost substitutes. 

They do so by two methods: 
• First,  the  network  non-duplication  and  syndicated  exclusivity  laws  and  regula-
tions allow broadcasters to block cable operators from cable-casting network and 
syndicated  programming  carried  by  stations  outside  of  the  broadcaster’s  pro-
tected  zone.  In  other  words,  the  conglomerate-owned  station  makes  itself  the 
only  game  in  town,  and  can  charge  the  cable  operator  a  monopoly  ‘‘price’’  for 
its  must-have  network  programming.  The  cable  operator  needs  this  program-
ming to compete. So your constituents end up paying monopoly prices. 
• Second,  the  media  conglomerates  require  network  affiliates  to  sign  contracts 
that prevent the affiliate from selling their programming to a cable operator in 
a  different  market.  Again,  the  conglomerate-owned  and  operated  stations  are 
the only game in town. 

In these situations, the cable companies’ only defense is to refuse to carry the pro-
gramming. This has virtually no effect on the media conglomerates, but it prevents 
your  constituents  from  receiving  must-have  network  programming  and  local  news. 
This result directly conflicts with the historic goals and intent of the retransmission 
consent and broadcast exclusivity rules, which were to promote consumer choice and 
localism. 

There are ready solutions to this dilemma. When a broadcaster seeks a ‘‘price’’ for 
retransmission  consent,  give  independent,  smaller  and  medium-sized  cable  compa-
nies the ability to shop for lower cost network programming for their customers. 

Accordingly, in our March 2, 2005, Petition for Rulemaking to the FCC, ACA pro-
posed the following adjustments to the FCC’s retransmission consent and broadcast 
exclusivity regulations: 

• One:  Maintain  broadcast  exclusivity  for  stations  that  elect  must-carry  or  that 
do  not  seek  additional  consideration  for  retransmission  consent.  This  ensures 
must-carry remains the primary option for programmers and ensures ‘‘localism.’’ 
• Two:  Eliminate  exclusivity  when  a  broadcaster  elects  retransmission  consent 
and  seeks  additional  consideration  for  carriage.  If  the  programmer  decides  to 
forego  their  must-carry  rights  in  the  hopes  of  putting  together  a  business  deal 
with  an  operator,  allow  the  operator  to  negotiate  freely  without  having  their 
hands tied. 
• Three:  Prohibit  any  party,  including  a  network,  from  preventing  a  broadcast 

station from granting retransmission consent. 

On  March  17,  2005,  the  FCC  released  ACA’s  petition  for  comments.  By  opening 
ACA’s  petition  for  public  comment,  the  FCC  has  acknowledged  that  the  current  re-
transmission  consent  and  broadcast  exclusivity  scheme  requires  further  scrutiny. 
Before codifying a new regulatory regime for digital television that carries all of the 
baggage  from  the  analog  world  with  it,  Congress  should  ask  similar  questions,  and 
make  the  important  decision  to  update  current  laws  to  rebalance  the  role  of  pro-
grammers and providers. 

Congress, too, should revisit the retransmission consent laws to correct the imbal-
ance caused by the substantial media ownership concentration that has taken place 
since  1992.  One  solution  is  to  codify  the  retransmission  consent  conditions  imposed 
on  Fox/News  Corp./DIRECTV  to  apply  across  the  retransmission  consent  process. 
The  three  key  components  of  those  conditions  include:  (i)  a  streamlined  arbitration 
process; (ii) the ability to carry a signal pending dispute resolution; and (iii) special 
conditions for smaller cable companies. 

In  summary,  the  retransmission  consent  and  broadcast  exclusivity  regulations 
have  been  used  by  the  networks  and  stations  to  raise  rates  and  to  force  unwanted 
programming  onto  consumers.  This  must  stop,  but  it  won’t  unless  Congress  acts.  If 
a  station  wants  to  be  carried,  it  can  elect  must-carry.  If  a  station  wants  to  charge 
for  retransmission  consent,  let  a  true  competitive  marketplace  establish  the  price. 
3.  Correct  Rules  That  Allow  for  Abusive  Behavior  Because  of  Media  Consolidation 

and Control of Content 

What  most  consumers  do  not  understand  is  that  my  independent  company,  and 
ACA member companies, must purchase most of their programming wholesale from 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

just  four  media  conglomerates,  referred  to  here  as  the  ‘‘Big  Four’’—Disney/ABC, 
Viacom/CBS,  News  Corp./DIRECTV/Fox,  and  General  Electric/NBC.  All  of  these 
companies  have  at  their  core  one  of  the  top  four  national  broadcast  networks.  In 
dealing  with  the  Big  Four,  all  ACA  members  continually  face  contractual  restric-
tions that eliminate local cable companies’ flexibility to package and distribute pro-
gramming  the  way  our  customers  would  like  it.  Instead,  programming  cartels, 
headquartered  thousands  of  miles  away,  decide  what  they  think  is  ‘‘valuable’’  con-
tent and what our customers and local communities see. On a basic level the digital 
transition  is  a  fundamental  paradigm  shift  that  could  be  very  disruptive  for  con-
sumers. Addressing these abuses is an opportunity for Congress to: (1) provide tan-
gible  benefits  to  consumers;  (2)  fulfill  the  true  promise  of  the  digital  transition  by 
providing  more  choice  and  control  to  consumers;  and,  (3)  to  make  a  consolidated 
media more accountable to people they serve. 

To fix this situation, Congress must update and reform the rules so that: 

a.  Local  providers  of  all  forms  and  customers  have  more  choice  and  flexibility 
in how programming channels are priced and packaged, including the ability to 
sell programming channels on a theme-based tier if necessary; 
b. Tying through retransmission consent must end. Today, the media giants hold 
local  broadcast  signals  hostage  with  monopolistic  cash-for-carriage  demands  or 
demands  for  carriage  of  affiliated  media-giant  programming,  which  was  never 
the intention of Congress when granting this power; 
c.  The  programming  pricing  gap  between  the  biggest  and  smallest  providers  is 
closed  to  ensure  that  customers  and  local  providers  in  smaller  markets  are  not 
subsidizing large companies and subscribers in urban America; and, 
d.  The  programming  media  giants  must  disclose,  at  least  to  Congress  and  the 
FCC,  what  they  are  charging  local  providers,  ending  the  strict  confidentiality 
and non-disclosure dictated by the media giants. Confidentiality and non-disclo-
sure mean lack of accountability of the media giants. 

Let me explain. 

Forced Cost and Channels 

For  nearly  all  of  the  50  most  distributed  channels  (see  Exhibit  2),  the  Big  Four 
contractually  obligate  my  company,  and  all  ACA  members,  to  distribute  the  pro-
gramming  to  all  basic  or  expanded  basic  customers  regardless  of  whether  we  think 
that  makes  sense  for  our  community.  These  same  contracts  also  mandate  carriage 
of less desirable channels in exchange for the rights to distribute desirable program-
ming. 

A small cable company that violated these carriage requirements would be subject 
to  legal  action  by  the  media  conglomerates,  and  for  ACA’s  members,  this  is  a  very 
real threat. 

These carriage restrictions prohibit ACA members from offering more customized 
channel  offerings  that  may  reflect  the  interests  and  values  of  our  specific  commu-
nity.  Thus,  any  interest  we  may  have  in  offering  a  family  tier  as  the  basic  tier  to 
our  constituencies  is  made  virtually  impossible  because  of  the  corporate  decisions 
made by the Big 4 and the terms and conditions they impose on our companies. 
More Forced Cost and Channels Through Retransmission Consent 

As previously discussed, retransmission consent has morphed from its original in-
tent to provide another means to impose additional cost and channel carriage obliga-
tions.  As  a  result,  nearly  all  customers  have  to  purchase  basic  or  expanded  basic 
packages filled with channels owned by the Big Four (See Exhibit 3). 
Forced Carriage Eliminates Diverse Programming Channels 

The  programming  practices  of  certain  Big  Four  members  have  also  restricted  the 
ability  of  some  ACA  members  to  launch  and  continue  to  carry  independent,  niche, 
minority,  religious,  and  ethnic  programming.  The  main  problem:  requirements  to 
carry  Big  Four-affiliated  programming  on  expanded  basic  eliminate  ‘‘shelf  space’’ 
where the cable provider could offer independent programming. 

If  new  independent  programmers  are  to  provide  outlets  for  this  type  of  program-
ming  to  reach  consumers,  you  must  ensure  that  they  are  not  subject  to  the  hand-
cuffs current programming practices place upon them. 
Local Flexibility Is Needed 

In  order  to  give  consumers  more  flexibility  and  better  value,  changes  in  current 
wholesale  programming  practices  and  market  conditions  are  needed  for  all  pro-
viders. Operators must be given more flexibility to tailor channel offerings that work 
best in their own local marketplaces.

37 

As  I  have  stated,  the  Big  Four  condition  access  to  popular  programming  on  a 
range  of  distribution  obligations  and  additional  carriage  requirements.  These  re-
strictions  and  obligations  eliminate  flexibility  to  offer  more  customized  channel 
packages in local markets. 

It’s  important  to  point  out  that  neither  my  company,  nor  any  ACA  member,  con-
trols  the  content  that’s  on  today’s  programming  channels.  That  content—decent  or 
not—is controlled by the media conglomerates that contractually and legally prevent 
us from changing or preempting any questionable or indecent content. 

However, if my company and other ACA members had more flexibility to package 
these  channels  with  the  involvement  of  our  customers,  current  indecency  concerns 
raised by both Congress and the FCC could also be addressed. 
Price Discrimination Against Smaller Cable Companies Makes Matters Worse 

The  wholesale  price  differentials  between  what  a  smaller  cable  company  pays  in 
rural America, compared to larger providers in urban America, have little to do with 
differences  in  cost,  and  much  to  do  with  disparities  in  market  power.  These  dif-
ferences  are  not  economically  cost-justified  and  could  easily  be  replicated  in  the  IP 
world as smaller entrants are treated to the same treatment our members face. 

Price discrimination against independent, smaller and medium-sized cable compa-
nies  and  their  customers  is  clearly  anti-competitive  conduct  on  the  part  of  the  Big 
Four—they offer a lower price to one competitor and force another other competitor 
to pay a 30–55 percent higher price for the same programming. In this way, smaller 
cable systems and their customers actually subsidize the programming costs of larg-
er urban distributors and consumers. This sad reality should not carry-over with the 
digital transition. 

In  order  to  give  consumers  in  smaller  markets  and  rural  areas  more  choice  and 
better  value,  media  conglomerates  must  be  required  to  eliminate  non-cost-based 
price discrimination against independent, smaller and medium-sized cable operators 
and customers in rural America. 

With  less  wholesale  price  discrimination,  ACA  members  could  offer  their  cus-
tomers  better  value  and  stop  subsidizing  programming  costs  of  large  distributors. 
Basis for Legislative and Regulatory Action 

Congress  has  the  legal  and  Constitutional  foundation  to  impose  content  neutral 
regulation  on  wholesale  programming  transactions.  The  program  access  laws  pro-
vide  the  model  and  the  vehicle,  and  those  laws  have  withstood  First  Amendment 
scrutiny. This hearing provides the Committee with a key opportunity to help deter-
mine  the  important  governmental  interests  that  are  being  harmed  by  current  pro-
gramming practices. 

Furthermore,  based  in  large  part  on  the  FCC’s  actions  in  the  DIRECTV-News 
Corp. merger, there is precedent for Congress and the FCC to address the legal and 
policy concerns raised by the current programming and retransmission consent prac-
tices  of  the  media  conglomerates.  The  FCC’s  analysis  and  conclusions  in  the  News 
Corp.  Order  persuasively  establish  the  market  power  wielded  by  owners  of  ‘‘must 
have’’  satellite  programming  and  broadcast  channels,  and  how  that  market  power 
can  be  used  to  harm  consumers.  That  analysis  applies  with  equal  force  to  other 
media conglomerates besides News Corp. 
Pierce the Programming Veil of Secrecy—End Nondisclosure and Confidentiality 

Most programming contracts are subject to strict confidentiality and nondisclosure 
obligations, and my company, and ACA members are very concerned about legal re-
taliation by certain Big Four programmers for violating this confidentiality. Ask me 
what I have to pay to receive a given channel and I cannot tell you because of terms 
and  conditions  the  conglomerates  insist  upon.  Why  does  this  confidentiality  and 
nondisclosure  exist?  Who  does  it  benefit?  Consumers,  Congress,  the  FCC?  I  don’t 
think  so.  Why  is  this  information  so  secret  when  much  of  the  infrastructure  the 
media giants benefit from derives from licenses and frequencies granted by the gov-
ernment? 

Congress  should  obtain  specific  programming  contracts  and  rate  information  di-
rectly  from  the  programmers,  either  by  agreement  or  under  the  Committee’s  sub-
poena  power.  That  information  should  then  be  compiled,  at  a  minimum,  to  develop 
a  Programming  Pricing  Index  (PPI).  The  PPI  would  be  a  simple,  yet  effective  way 
to  gauge  how  programming  rates  rise  or  fall  while  still  protecting  the  rates,  terms, 
and conditions of the individual contract. By authorizing the FCC to collect this in-
formation  in  a  manner  that  protects  the  unique  details  of  individual  agreements, 
I cannot see who could object. 

Armed  with  this  information,  Congress  and  the  FCC  would  finally  be  able  to 
gauge  whether  rising  cable  rates  are  due  to  rising  programming  prices  as  we  have 
claimed,  or  whether  cable  operators  have  simply  used  that  argument  as  a  ruse.  A

38 

PPI  would  finally  help  everyone  get  to  the  bottom  of  the  problems  behind  higher 
cable  and  satellite  rates.  We  at  ACA  are  so  convinced  that  this  type  of  information 
will  aid  you  in  your  deliberations  that  we  challenge  our  colleagues  in  the  program-
ming  marketplace  to  work  with  us,  and  this  committee,  to  craft  a  process  for  the 
collection of that data. 

In  short,  without  disclosure,  there  is  no  accountability.  The  digital  transition  is 
about  how  to  manage  broadcasting  in  America,  and  is  an  opportunity  to  make 
things fundamentally better for consumers. 
4. Make Access To Quality Local-Into-Local Television Signals Available 

In  the  first  section  of  my  testimony,  I  outlined  the  enormous  technical,  financial, 
and  operational  challenges  facing  independent  cable  in  smaller  markets  and  rural 
areas  to  accomplish  the  DTV  transition.  While  we  are  committed  to  making  the 
transition  work,  it  will  be  no  small  feat  to  make  this  transition  happen  in  ACA 
members’ marketplaces without putting the many advanced services we now provide 
at great risk. 

Another  important  reality  about  digital  signals  is  that  they  will  not  likely  have 
the  same  distribution  range  as  the  analog  signals  they  replace.  One  way  to  help 
solve  this  problem  is  to  grant  cable  access  to  local-into-local  television  signals  al-
ready being delivered by direct broadcast satellite (DBS) companies. 

The  digital  spectrum  assigned  will  not  have  the  same  propagation  qualities  as 
many of the analog signals they replace. As a result, while most metropolitan cable 
operators  and  DBS  will  have  access  to  improved  digital  signals,  some  rural  cable 
operators will find they no longer can receive any usable signal at all. This is what 
is  refered  to  as  the  digital  cliff.  In  local-into-local  markets,  DBS  can  deliver  clear, 
local broadcast signals regardless of distance from transmitters. ACA members and 
their  buying  representative,  the  National  Cable  Television  Cooperative  in  Lenexa, 
Kansas,  have  asked  both  DIRECTV  and  EchoStar  for  the  right  to  buy  and  pay  for 
access  to  DBS’  local-into-local  signals  where  a  good  quality  signal  is  not  available 
over-the-air.  However,  the  DBS  duopoly  refuses  to  allow  rural  cable  systems  to  re-
ceive  these  DBS-delivered  broadcast  signals,  even  though  DBS  now  sells  the  same 
signals to private cable operators, satellite master antenna system owners, and sev-
eral Bell companies. 

Ironically,  DBS  now  refuses  to  grant  access  to  its  programming,  despite  the  fa-
vored  regulatory  treatment  it  received  to  have  access  to  cable  programming.  The 
ability  to  receive  local  broadcast  signals  was  the  reason  Congress  enacted  the  Sat-
ellite Home Viewer Improvement Act in 1999, which Congress recently reauthorized 
through  SHVERA.  But  SHVERA  does  nothing  to  solve  the  local  signal  problem  for 
rural cable operators and customers. 

Congress  can  solve  this  problem  by  revising  the  retransmission  consent  laws  as 

follows: 

In  markets  where  a  satellite  carrier  delivers  local-into-local  signals,  that  sat-
ellite  carrier  shall  make  those  signals  available  to  MVPDs  of  all  types  on  non-
discriminatory  prices,  terms  and  conditions  where  the  MVPD  has  the  consent 
of the broadcaster to retransmit the signal. 

ACA’s  recommended  revisions  to  the  laws  and  regulations  governing  retrans-
mission  transmission  consent  and  broadcast  exclusivity  are  modest.  But  they  will 
advance  the  widespread  dissemination  of  good,  quality  local  broadcast  signals  to 
your  constituents,  and  will  address  the  serious  competitive  imbalance  currently 
hurting  small  market  and  rural  cable  systems.  Carrying  this  restrictive  situation 
into  the  DTV  world  would  further  compound  this  mistake.  All  video  vendors  must 
be  able  to  have  access  to  quality  signals  if  they  are  going  to  be  viable  competitors 
within in the DTV marketplace. 
Conclusion 

This  Committee  stands  today  at  the  threshold  of  the  new  digital  world,  but  it  is 

also a precipice. The challenges are many and the risks are great. 

The  DTV  transition  provides  you  with  the  power  to  determine  whether  to  recog-
nize  that  rural  America  and  its  service  providers  have  unique  financial  and  geo-
graphic challenges to face while making this conversion. At the same time you have 
the  opportunity  to  repudiate  outdated  regulatory  structures  that  raise  rates  and 
force  programming  on  your  constituents,  while  replacing  it  by  injecting  market- 
based solutions. 

I  hope  you  will  be  able  to  address  both  halves  to  this  problem,  and  I  appreciate 
the  opportunity  to  testify  on  behalf  of  the  ACA’s  many  members’  views  on  these 
matters.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD SLENKER, EXECUTIVE VICE 

PRESIDENT, TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING 

OPERATIONS, DIRECTV, INC. 

Mr.  SLENKER.  Chairman  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye,  and  members 
of the Committee, my name is Richard Slenker, and I’m the Execu-
tive  Vice  President  of  Technology  and  Engineering  Operations  at

DIRECTV.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  on  behalf  of 
DIRECTV regarding the digital television transition. 

I  have  two  simple  messages  today.  First,  DIRECTV  is  spending 
billions  of  dollars  on  satellites  that  will  allow  us  to  offer  as  many 
as  1,500  local  channels  in  high  definition  by  2008,  all  without  a 
government  mandate  of  any  kind.  Second,  DIRECTV’s  ability  to 
offer  these  local  high-definition  channels  will  be  seriously  com-
promised, if not totally eliminated, if Congress adopts onerous car-
riage requirements. 

While  the  requirements  would  burden  cable  operators,  they 
would cripple DIRECTV’s high-definition local plans. In 1999, Con-
gress  granted  satellite  operators  the  right  to  carry  local  broadcast 
stations.  In  doing  so,  Congress  created  a  ‘‘carry  one/carry  all’’  re-
gime  for  satellite  that  reflected  the  technological  differences  be-
tween  satellite  and  cable.  This  unleashed,  for  the  first  time,  real 
competition  to  cable,  and  the  result  has  been  nothing  short  of  as-
tounding. 

In 1999, the DBS industry had ten million customers. Today, sat-
ellite  has  more  than  25  million  customers.  This  extraordinary  suc-
cess  is  due,  in  no  small  measure,  to  the  fact  that  Congress  recog-
nized  the  differences  between  satellite  and  cable  technology,  and 
crafted a law that takes these differences into account. As a result, 
DIRECTV  has  invested  billions  of  dollars  to  provide  analog  local 
broadcast  stations  in  135  local  markets  serving  over  93  percent  of 
U.S. television households. 

We are now extending this commitment to the provision of high- 
definition  local  broadcast  channels,  once  again  investing  billions  of 
dollars  to  design  and  launch  four  next-generation  satellites.  This 
investment  will  drive  vigorous  competition  with  cable,  and  hasten 
the digital transition, all to the benefit of the American public. 

Our  ability  to  bring  this  digital  and  high-definition  broadcast 
programming  to  U.S.  consumers  will  collapse  if  satellite  operators 
are forced to carry broadcasters’ multicast channels or all free bits. 
Any  material  increase  in  existing  carriage  obligations  will  cripple 
our high-definition plans and undermine the ability of DBS to com-
pete effectively with cable. 

To appreciate why any additional carriage requirements on DBS 
would  have  such  a  devastating  effect,  it’s  important  to  understand 
the  capacity  limitations  and  technical  differences  between  satellite 
and cable. 

Quite simply, satellite has far less capacity to carry local signals 
than do cable operators. This reflects the differences between offer-
ing  local  signals  on  a  national  satellite  platform  versus  a  local 
cable system. While a typical cable system may only retransmit 10 
to  15  broadcast  signals  at  a  time,  DIRECTV  must  simultaneously 
retransmit over 1,000 broadcast signals from a single satellite con-
stellation. 

DIRECTV  has  met  this  challenge  by  employing  state-of-the-art 
technology. First, DIRECTV has launched spot-beam satellites that 
create  additional  capacity  by  reusing  spectrum  in  different  geo-
graphic  areas.  Second,  we  increase  capacity  by  using  advanced 
compression,  a  technique  for  mathematically  removing  redundant 
and unneeded digital bits.

DIRECTV  believes  its  future  lies  in  bringing  its  customers  more 
high-definition  programming,  particularly  local  stations  in  high 
definition. Our plans depend critically on two factors: first, the abil-
ity  to  use  cutting-edge  technology,  especially  use  of  advanced  com-
pression techniques; and second, the carriage of a broadcaster’s pri-
mary signal only. Both of these elements are crucial, because even 
compression  has  its  limits.  The  amount  of  underlying  broadcast 
content to be carried must be reasonable. 

If  DIRECTV  must  carry  each  broadcaster’s  multicast  program-
ming,  we  will  be  forced  to  cut  back  dramatically  on  the  number  of 
markets we currently serve. Thus, it is imperative that the satellite 
carriers  be  allowed  to  transmit  only  the  compressed  primary  video 
signal  if  they  are  to  continue  providing  local-into-local  service  in  a 
substantial number of the Nation’s markets. 

DIRECTV  is  able  to  retransmit  local  broadcast  signals  in  the 
first  place  because  the  ‘‘carry  one/carry  all’’  rules  specify  only  that 
DIRECTV  retransmit  the  primary  video  and  accompanying  audio 
signals  of 
local  broadcast  stations,  and  specifically  permits 
DIRECTV  to  use  reasonable  compression  techniques  in  such  re-
transmissions.  DIRECTV  can,  thus,  meet  its  statutory  obligations, 
all  the  while  maintaining  the  digital  clarity  that  has  become  the 
hallmark of our service. 

Imposing  a  multicast,  must-carry,  or  all-free-bits  obligation  on 
DBS  would  force  DIRECTV  to  scrap  its  local-into-local  high-defini-
tion  plans  and  shrink  its  local-into-local  broadcast  service,  casting 
an  ominous  shadow  over  what  has  been  an  extremely  successful 
Congressional  effort  to  promote  competition  in  the  video  market-
place.  We  encourage  Congress  to  maintain  policies  that  preserve  a 
vibrant,  competitive  video  marketplace  that  has  reaped  enormous 
benefits for the American public. 

Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I’d like to thank 
you for allowing me to give DIRECTV’s perspective on these issues, 
and I’m happy to take your questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Slenker follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD SLENKER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING OPERATIONS, DIRECTV, INC. 

Chairman  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye,  and  members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is 
Richard  Slenker  and  I  am  the  Executive  Vice  President,  Technology  and  Engineer-
ing  Operations  at  DIRECTV  Inc.  (DIRECTV).  I  am  responsible  for  the  day-to-day 
operations  of  DIRECTV’s  satellites,  broadcast  centers,  and  other  technologies  used 
to provide direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service. Thank you for inviting me to tes-
tify on behalf of DIRECTV regarding the digital television (DTV) transition. 

I  have  two  simple  messages  for  you  today.  First,  DIRECTV  is  spending  billions 
of  dollars  on  satellites  that  will  allow  us  to  offer  as  many  as  1,500  local  channels 
in  high-definition  (HD)  by  2008—all  without  a  government  mandate  of  any  kind. 
Second,  DIRECTV’s  ability  to  offer  these  local  HD  channels  will  be  seriously  com-
promised,  if  not  totally  eliminated,  if  Congress  adopts  onerous  carriage  require-
ments.  While  such  requirements  would  burden  cable  operators,  they  would  cripple 
DIRECTV’s HD local plans. 

In  1999,  Congress  granted  satellite  operators  the  right  to  carry  local  broadcast 
stations.  In  doing  so,  Congress  created  a  ‘‘carry  one  carry  all’’  carriage  regime  for 
satellite that reflected the technological differences between satellite and cable. This 
unleashed, for the first time, real competition to cable, and the result has been noth-
ing  short  of  astounding.  In  1999  the  DBS  industry  had  10  million  customers—and 
today  satellite  has  more  than  26  million  customers.  This  extraordinary  success  is 
due  in  no  small  measure  to  the  fact  that  Congress  recognized  the  differences  be-
tween satellite and cable technology, and crafted a law that takes these differences

into  account.  As  a  result,  DIRECTV  has  invested  billions  of  dollars  to  provide  ana-
log  local  broadcast  stations  in  over  135  local  markets,  serving  over  93  percent  of 
U.S. television households. 

We  are  now  extending  this  commitment  to  the  provision  of  high  definition  local 
broadcast  channels.  We  are  investing  billions  more  to  design  and  launch  four  next- 
generation  satellites  over  the  next  several  years.  These  satellites,  which  markedly 
extend  the  state-of-the-art  in  the  satellite  industry,  will  have  the  capacity  for  as 
many  as  1,500  high  definition  local  broadcast  channels.  This  investment  will  drive 
vigorous  competition  with  cable  and  hasten  the  digital  transition,  all  to  the  benefit 
of the American public. 

I  must  caution  members  of  the  Committee  that  our  ability  to  bring  this  digital 
and  high  definition  broadcast  programming  to  U.S.  consumers  will  collapse  if  sat-
ellite  operators  are  forced  to  carry  broadcasters’  multicast  service  or  ‘‘all  free  bits.’’ 
Any material increase in existing carriage obligations will cripple our high definition 
plans and undermine the ability of DBS to compete effectively with cable. 

DIRECTV  urges  Congress  not  to  let  this  happen.  Congress  should  build  on  the 
success  of  ‘‘carry  one/carry  all’’  such  that  the  ‘‘the  practical  differences  between  the 
two  industries  are  recognized  and  accounted  for’’  in  the  digital  world.  In  this  way, 
Congress will ensure that the vibrant competitive marketplace we experience today 
will continue to exist tomorrow. 
DIRECTV  Relies  on  State-of-the-Art  Technology  To  Retransmit  Local 

Stations 

Given  its  dominance  in  the  video  market,  it  is  understandable  that  the  focus  of 
the  policy  debate  has  centered  on  cable  television.  But  it  is  critically  important  for 
policymakers  to  account  for  the  capacity  limitations  and  technical  differences  be-
tween  DBS  and  cable  in  any  DTV  legislation.  Otherwise,  expanded  digital  carriage 
requirements  will  threaten  DIRECTV’s  HD  rollout  in  markets  across  the  country, 
which would only serve to harm competition in the video marketplace. 

First,  satellite  has  far  less  effective  capacity  to  carry  local  signals  than  do  cable 
operators.  This  reflects  the  difference  between  offering  local  signals  on  a  national 
satellite platform vs. a local cable system. 

A  typical  cable  central  office,  or  ‘‘headend,’’  collects  over-the-air  broadcast  signals 
from  the  surrounding  community  and  retransmits  those  signals  to  viewers.  Thus, 
a  cable  system  will  typically  retransmit  ten  to  fifteen  broadcast  signals  at  a  time. 
DIRECTV, by contrast, must retransmit broadcast signals in markets from coast to 
coast  from  a  single  satellite  constellation,  the  satellite  equivalent  of  the  cable 
headend. DIRECTV today retransmits the signals of over 1,000 local stations simul-
taneously. This requires an enormous amount of capacity and has been the principal 
engineering challenge DIRECTV has faced over the past 5 years. 

DIRECTV  has  met  this  challenge  by  employing  state-of-the-art  technology.  First, 
DIRECTV  has  launched  spot-beam  satellites  that  create  additional  capacity  by 
reusing spectrum in different geographic areas. The more traditional CONUS-beam 
satellites  have  a  single,  multi-frequency  (or  multi-transponder) 1 footprint  that  cov-
ers  the  entire  continental  United  States.  While  CONUS  satellites  are  excellent  for 
retransmitting national programming, using them to retransmit local broadcast pro-
gramming  is  a  very  wasteful  use  of  spectrum.  For  example,  if  DIRECTV  wanted  to 
retransmit  a  Boston  station  on  a  CONUS  satellite,  it  would  have  to  retransmit  the 
station  to  the  entire  United  States,  even  though,  by  law,  only  Boston-area  sub-
scribers  could  watch  it.  Naturally,  if  one  were  to  try  to  retransmit  local  broadcast 
stations  in  every  market  throughout  the  country  via  CONUS  satellites,  capacity  on 
the  satellites  would  quickly  be  exhausted  leaving  little,  if  any  room  for  national 
cable programming. 

By  contrast,  spot-beam  satellites  are  much  better  for  the  retransmission  of  local 
broadcast  signals  because,  rather  than  ‘‘seeing’’  the  entire  United  States  with  a 
large  number  of  transponders,  they  ‘‘see’’  multiple,  discrete  areas,  each  with  only 
one  or  two  transponders.  Spot  beam  satellites  thus  allow  the  geographic  ‘‘reuse’’  of 
satellite  frequencies—as  transponders  operating  over  the  same  frequencies  can  si-
multaneously  transmit  signals  to  Houston  and  Chicago.  This  reuse  is  akin  to  your 
car  radio—there  might  be  FM  stations  operating  at  99.5  in  Washington,  D.C.,  New 
York,  and  Boston,  and,  as  long  as  they  are  far  enough  apart,  they  do  not  interfere 
with  one  another.  Thus,  the  99.5  frequency  is  ‘‘re-used’’  among  these  three  cities. 

1 A single DBS transponder covers 24 MHz of spectrum.

By covering discrete and non-overlapping geographic areas, satellite spot-beams can 
accomplish much the same thing.2 

The  second  technique  used  to  increase  capacity  is  compression,  a  technique  for 
mathematically  manipulating  information  to  remove  redundant  and  unneeded  bits. 
In  the  early  1990s,  compression  rates  were  roughly  5:1  (meaning  that  you  could  fit 
five  cable  channels  or  broadcast  signals  on  a  standard  24  MHz  DBS  transponder). 
Today, for standard definition television signals, compression rates are typically be-
tween 11:1 to 12:1, and further improvements are on the horizon. Compression rates 
for  HD  signals  are,  of  course,  much  lower—but  these,  too,  are  expected  to  improve. 
Take,  for  example,  the  Washington  D.C.  designated  market  area.  DIRECTV  sat-
ellites  have  a  spot  beam  with  two  transponders  covering  the  region  around  Wash-
ington,  D.C.  At  12:1  compression,  the  retransmission  of  each  of  Washington’s  12 
analog broadcast stations in standard definition format can be achieved while leav-
ing additional capacity for carriage of local signals in the other markets covered by 
the  same  spot  beam.  However,  if  DIRECTV  were  required  to  carry  each  station’s 
multicast signal without using compression, it would have to allocate up to an entire 
transponder  to  each  station.  Under  this  scenario,  DIRECTV  could  carry  only  two 
Washington  stations,  and  thus,  under  the  current  ‘‘carry  one  carry  all’’  rules, 
DIRECTV could not retransmit any local signals to Washington (much less have ca-
pacity remaining to support local service in other markets within the beam). Accord-
ingly,  the  spot  beam  infrastructure  that  DIRECTV  has  developed,  and  deployed  at 
a  cost  of  billions  of  dollars,  would  be  rendered  essentially  useless.  Moreover,  even 
if  it  were  possible  to  take  all  of  the  frequencies  DIRECTV  currently  uses  for  local 
signal  carriage  nationwide  and  dedicate  them  to  providing  local  stations  in  Wash-
ington at a 1:1 compression ratio, there still would not be sufficient capacity to serve 
even this single market. 

The  bottom  line  is  that,  if  you  want  to  know  how  much  capacity  a  satellite  oper-
ator  has  to  retransmit  local  broadcast  signals  in  a  particular  market,  you  need  to 
know not just how many transponders the satellite operator has, but also how many 
transponders  are  available  in  the  spot  beam  covering  that  market,  as  well  as  how 
much the satellite operator is able to compress the signal while still maintaining sig-
nal quality. 
When the Transition Ends, Cable Will Set Aside Less Bandwidth for Broad-

cast Signals While DBS Will Dedicate More 

The cable industry does not face the same technological hurdles or bandwidth con-
straints as DBS when it comes to delivering local broadcast stations. And more im-
portantly,  the  end  of  analog  broadcasting  will  result  in  a  huge  spectrum  windfall 
for the cable industry. Today, cable provides local broadcast signals in an analog for-
mat. Assuming the absence of additional carriage obligations, by switching to digital 
and  employing  compression  techniques,  cable  operators  will  be  able  to  reduce  the 
amount  of  bandwidth  they  set  aside  for  broadcasters  by  at  least  100  percent,  and 
in  many  cases,  much  more.  The  same  is  not  true  for  DBS.  We  have  always  been 
digital, and have already realized the efficiencies and bandwidth savings made pos-
sible by advanced modulation, coding, and most importantly, digital compression. As 
these  techniques  have  improved,  DIRECTV  has  been  able  to  ‘‘fit’’  more  analog 
broadcast  channels  into  spot  beams.  HD  programming,  however,  contains  far  more 
data  than  analog,  requiring  far  more  capacity  even  after  compression.  Thus,  HD 
broadcasting will require significantly more bandwidth than DIRECTV dedicates to 
broadcasters  today.  And,  any  kind  of  multicasting  or  ‘‘free  bit’’  requirement  would 
only further exacerbate this discrepancy imposing a far greater burden on DBS than 
on cable. 
Multicast Proposals Would Cripple DIRECTV’s Local-Into-Local HD Service 
DIRECTV  is  able  to  retransmit  local  broadcast  signals  in  the  first  place  because 
the  ‘‘carry  one  carry  all’’  rules  specify  only  that  DIRECTV  retransmit  the  ‘‘primary 
video  [and]  accompanying  audio’’  signals  of  local  broadcast  stations.  They  rightfully 
do  not  mandate  the  amount  of  bandwidth  that  DIRECTV  must  use  to  retransmit 
the signals, or that DIRECTV must retransmit signals that do not relate to the pri-
mary  video  feed.  Indeed,  the  law  specifically  permits  DIRECTV  to  use  ‘‘reasonable 
compression techniques’’ in such retransmissions. DIRECTV can thus meet its stat-

2 To give you an idea of how important this technology is, DIRECTV has 46 DBS frequencies, 
10 of which have been dedicated for use in spot beams to deliver nearly 900 local broadcast sta-
tions. If these same frequencies were used in CONUS beams, they could carry only on the order 
of  120  stations.  Clearly,  DIRECTV’s  use  of  advanced  spot  beam  technology  has  been  the 
lynchpin of its local service capability.

utory  obligations,  while  reducing  the  bandwidth  of  the  signals,  all  the  while  main-
taining the digital clarity that is a hallmark of our service. 

Some  broadcasters,  however,  want  to  change  this  formulation  for  the  retrans-
mission  of  DTV  signals.  They  say  that  satellite  carriers  should  be  required  to  re-
transmit  not  just  the  ‘‘primary  video’’  of  digital  signals,  but  also  multicast  services 
or in the alternative ‘‘all free bits.’’ What that really means is that satellite carriers 
would  be  required  to  retransmit  the  entire  bit  stream  of  a  broadcaster’s  digital 
transmission—including  redundant  and  other  bits  unnecessary  for  a  quality  digital 
video signal, and even bits that have nothing to do with video service at all.3 Were 
such  a  rule  applied  under  today’s  carry  one  carry  all  regime,  this  would  mean  that 
satellite operators would have to offer such a ‘‘pipe’’ to all broadcasters in a market 
before retransmitting the digital signals of any such broadcaster. As my earlier dis-
cussion of the Washington, D.C. market illustrates, if that were the rule, DIRECTV 
would  be  carrying  local  stations  in  a  handful  of  markets  versus  the  135  we  are  in 
today. 

DIRECTV  believes  its  future  lies  in  bringing  its  customers  more  high-definition 
signals,  particularly  local  stations  in  high  definition.  Moreover,  those  signals  will 
have to be of sufficient quality to compete with the high-definition offerings of cable 
operators, or DIRECTV will likely lose subscribers to cable. Our plans depend criti-
cally  upon  two  factors:  (1)  the  ability  to  use  cutting-edge  technology,  especially  the 
use of advanced compression techniques, and (2) the carriage of a broadcaster’s pri-
mary  video  signal  only.  If  DIRECTV  is  required  to  carry  each  broadcaster’s 
multicast  programming,  we  will  be  forced  to  cut  back  dramatically  on  the  number 
of digital markets we can serve. 
Multicast  Must  Carry  Penalizes  Creative  Entrepreneurs  and  Threatens 

MVPD Competition 

Our  decision  to  invest  billions  of  dollars  in  order  to  provide  a  local-into-local  HD 
broadcast service is a response to the demands of our customers and the competitive 
environment  in  which  we  operate.  It  would  truly  be  unfortunate  if  Congress  were 
to jeopardize this competition, and our ability to meet consumer demand, by impos-
ing a multicast must-carry obligation on DBS. 

Quite  frankly,  the  broadcasters  have  not  made  a  compelling  case  as  to  why  their 
existing must-carry rights—carriage of their primary video and accompanying audio 
signal—should  be  dramatically  increased  in  a  digital  world.  Broadcasters  play  an 
important role in their local communities and are required to serve the public inter-
est in exchange for their use of the public airwaves. They play a special and unique 
role  in  our  society  and  enjoy  a  special  and  unique  privilege  in  the  guaranteed  car-
riage  of  their  programming  on  cable  and  satellite  systems.  That  privilege  will  re-
main undiminished once the transition to digital broadcasting is complete. But if the 
broadcasters want to exploit the opportunities that the digital era offers by creating 
new  content  and  new  services,  there  is  simply  no  reason  why  they  shouldn’t  have 
to compete with every other entrepreneur with a good idea. Mandating the carriage 
of  any  new  service  a  digital  broadcaster  may  offer  is  unfair  to  every  other  non- 
broadcast  programmer,  and  will  force  MVPD  platforms  to  use  precious  bandwidth 
based on government fiat rather than consumer demand. 

The  MVPD  marketplace  is  competitive  and  will  respond  to  compelling  ideas.  If 
broadcasters  create  new  programming  services  that  consumers  demand,  competing 
distribution  platforms  will  want  to  carry  it  (to  the  extent  they  have  capacity  to  do 
so).  Conversely,  imposing  a  multicast  must-carry  obligation  on  DBS  would  force 
DIRECTV to scrap its local into local HD plans and shrink its local into local broad-
cast  service,  casting  an  ominous  shadow  over  what  has  been  a  successful  Congres-
sional effort to promote multichannel video competition. 

We  encourage  Congress  to  maintain  policies  that  preserve  a  vibrant  competitive 

video marketplace that has reaped enormous benefits for the American public. 

Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  al-
lowing me to give DIRECTV’s perspective on these issues. I am happy to take your 
questions. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
The  last  witness  is  Mr.  John  Lawson,  President  and  CEO  of  the 

Association of Public Television Stations.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN LAWSON, PRESIDENT/CEO, 
ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC TELEVISION STATIONS (APTS) 

Mr.  LAWSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Co-Chairman,  it’s  good  to  see 
you again. I’m still exhausted after the CPB hearing yesterday, and 
I’m  not  sure  how  you  do  this  every  day.  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  on  behalf  of  the  local 
public television stations. 

Public  television  has  been  a  leader  in  the  digital  transition. 
We’ve raised, with your help, over $1.1 billion for the digital build-
out. We’ve launched exciting new services in high definition, multi-
casting, and wireless data delivery. 

Last January, we concluded a landmark agreement that guaran-
tees that multiple digital channels from every public television sta-
tion  will  be  carried  on  every  major  cable  system  in  America.  And 
my  Association  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  have  a 
cooperative  agreement  to  use  digital  public  television  to  upgrade 
the aging Emergency Alert System. 

We’re  truly  serious  about  completing  the  transition.  We’re  pre-
pared  to  work  with  you  to  provide  solutions  to  make  a  hard  date 
a  reality.  The  single-greatest  barrier  to  success  is  the  public’s  lack 
of  understanding  about  the  conversion  to  DTV  and  what  it  really 
means  for  them.  There  needs  to  be  a  well-planned,  adequately 
funded,  closely  coordinated  campaign  to  reach,  especially,  the  tens 
of  millions  of  households  who  depend  upon  over-the-air  reception. 
We need to make it seamless for them to go digital. This campaign 
should begin soon, and continue until every household is converted. 
Without  this  focus,  Congress  and  we  will  have  a  consumer  train 
wreck  on  our  hands,  and  the  hard  date  could  be  postponed  for 
years. 

Public  television  would  prefer  to  be  part  of  a  large  coalition  of 
stakeholders  informed  by  the  SwitchCo  model  in  the  U.K.  But, 
whatever  the  model,  public  television  is  willing  to  play  a  leading 
role  in  this  campaign.  And  we’re  suited  to  do  this  for  a  number  of 
reasons: 

First,  the  over-the-air-reliant  TV  viewers  are  our  viewers.  Re-
search indicates that the over-the-air households correlate strongly 
with  public  television’s  viewer  base.  When  they  watch  television, 
these people tend to watch PBS. Other OTA viewers are dispropor-
tionately  low-income,  rural,  Spanish-speaking,  and  elderly,  and  we 
also effectively reach them with our programming. 

Based on examples from Europe, consumers will actually buy set- 
top boxes if they see a value in doing so, which usually means they 
get  more  free  channels  through  DTV.  Public  television,  here,  pro-
vides that value, because we offer multicast programming, new free 
channels that are only available through digital reception. 

Finally,  Americans  trust  public  television,  as  confirmed  in  poll 
after  poll.  And  we  have  a  Universal  Service  mandate.  We  believe 
public  television  is  in  a  unique  position  to  reach  the  last  holdouts, 
and help them go digital. 

Is there a cost to supporting consumer education? Yes. But com-
bined with appealing new digital broadcast services, it could mean 
the  government  pockets  a  greater  share  of  auction  revenue.  The 
set-top-box subsidy could be reduced, because consumers will actu-
ally seek the converter box in the marketplace.

Senators,  you  have  assisted  public  television  immensely  in  con-
verting  to  DTV.  Now  is  the  chance  to  leverage  that  investment,  to 
make us partners in completing the digital transition. 

We also believe other elements are needed for success: 
First,  our  agreement  with  NCTA  guarantees  carriage  of  our 
multicast  programming  on  cable  systems.  We’re  also  talking  with 
ACA.  But  there  are  no  provisions  in  law,  and  no  voluntary  agree-
ments  in  place  yet,  with  the  direct  broadcast  satellite  operators; 
and,  one  way  or  the  other,  we  must  guarantee  digital  carriage  on 
DBS. 

Second,  we  need  guaranteed  carriage  on  new  technology  plat-
forms,  and  we  are  having  promising  discussions  with  the  telco’s, 
I’m happy to report. 

Third,  along  with  libraries,  museums,  and  universities,  we  urge 
passage  of  S.  1023,  the  Digital  Opportunity  Investment  Trust,  or 
DOIT,  which  was  introduced  this  year  by  Senators  Dodd,  Snowe, 
Durbin,  and  Burns.  DOIT  proposes  to  use  a  portion  of  spectrum 
auction revenue to capitalize a trust fund which would support the 
creation of digital content to serve the education needs of this coun-
try. DOIT is a historical descendant of the Land Grant College Act 
and  the  GI  bill,  both  of  which  led  to  monumental  expansions  in 
educational access for Americans. 

Finally,  we  hope  the  Senate  will  continue  its  historic  bipartisan 
role  in  support  of  public  broadcasting.  The  Labor-HHS  appropria-
tions bill is being marked up today, and we urge you to provide full 
funding  for  public  television  and  radio.  And  we  greatly  appreciate 
the  positive  comments  yesterday.  Investing  in  public  television  is 
a great investment for the digital transition. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN LAWSON, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC TELEVISION STATIONS (APTS) 

Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Inouye,  other  members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for 

inviting me to testify on behalf of the local public television stations. 

delivery. 

Public television has been a leader in the digital transition. 
• We’ve raised, with Congress’ help, over $1.1 billion for the digital build-out. 
• We’ve launched exciting new services in HDTV, multicasting, and wireless data 

• Last  January,  we  concluded  a  landmark  agreement  that  guarantees  that  mul-
tiple  digital  channels  from  every  public  television  station  will  be  carried  on 
every major cable system in America. 

• And my Association and the Department of Homeland Security have a coopera-
tive  agreement  to  use  digital  public  television  to  upgrade  the  aging  Emergency 
Alert System. 

We  are  truly  serious  about  completing  our  march  to  what  we  call  digital-only 
broadcasting.  For  these  reasons,  we  are  prepared  to  do  what  we  can  to  make  a 
‘‘hard date’’ a reality. We want to work with you to provide solutions for a successful 
transition. 

The single most significant barrier is the American public’s lack of understanding 
about  the  conversion  to  digital  television  and  what  it  means  to  them.  There  needs 
to  be  a  well-planned,  adequately  funded,  closely  coordinated  effort  to  educate  and 
inform  the  general  public.  We  must  reach  the  tens  of  millions  households  who  de-
pend upon over-the-air reception and make it seamless for them to go digital. With-
out  this  focus,  we,  and  Congress,  will  have  a  consumer  train  wreck  on  our  hands, 
and the hard date could be postponed by years.

We  need  a  consumer  awareness  campaign  that  begins  soon  and  continues  until 
every household has been converted. And like any campaign, it should use a variety 
of media and outreach tactics—especially television spots. 

Public  television  would  prefer  to  be  part  of  a  large  coalition  of  stakeholders,  in-
formed  by  the  SwitchCo  model  in  the  United  Kingdom.  But  whatever  the  model, 
PTV is willing to play a leading role in this campaign. 

We are in a unique position to play a central role for a number of reasons. 
• The over-the-air reliant TV viewers are our viewers. Research indicates that the 
OTA  households  correlate  strongly  with  public  television’s  viewer  base.  When 
they  watch  television,  these  people  tend  to  watch  PBS,  even  more  than  people 
with cable or satellite. 

• Other OTA viewers are disproportionately low-income, rural, Spanish-speaking, 
and elderly viewers, all of whom we reach with our programming, in some cases 
more than any other medium. 

• Based  on  examples  from  Europe,  consumers  will  actually  buy  set-top  boxes  if 
they  see  a  value  in  doing  so,  which  usually  means  they  get  more  free  channels 
through  DTV.  Public  television  here  provides  that  value,  because  we  offer 
multicast programming—new free channels that are only available through dig-
ital reception. We are the leaders, by far, in the broadcasting industry, in offer-
ing new digital channels. 

• Finally, there is the trust factor. Americans trust public television, as confirmed 
in poll after poll. We also have a Universal Service mandate. We believe public 
television  is  in  a  unique  position  to  reach  the  last  hold-outs  and  help  them  go 
digital. 

Is there a cost to supporting consumer education? Yes, but I also believe the more 
we  invest  in  consumer  education,  the  less  the  government  will  have  to  use  auction 
revenue  to  subsidize  set-top  boxes.  Ultimately,  consumer  education,  combined  with 
appealing  new  digital  broadcast  services,  could  mean  the  government  pockets  a 
greater  share  of  auction  revenue,  because  consumers  will  seek  the  converter  boxes 
in  the  marketplace.  (Please  refer  to  Appendix  A  for  a  more  detailed  description  of 
a proposed consumer education campaign involving the public television system.) 

Senators,  you  have  assisted  public  television  immensely  in  converting  to  DTV. 
Now  is  a  chance  to  leverage  that  investment,  to  make  us  partners  in  our  Nation’s 
drive to complete the digital transition. 

Beyond  consumer  education  and  technical  assistance,  we  believe  there  are  other 

elements necessary for a successful transition. 

• First,  our  agreement  with  the  National  Cable  &  Telecommunications  Associa-
tion  and  its  members,  guarantees  carriage  of  public  television’s  multicast  pro-
gramming  on  cable  systems.  But  there  are  no  provisions  in  law,  and  there  are 
no  voluntary  agreements  to  ensure  carriage  of  broadcasters’  digital  signals  on 
direct broadcast satellite systems. One way or another, we must guarantee car-
riage of our digital signals on DBS. 
• Second, we need guaranteed carriage on new technology platforms. We are hav-
ing promising discussions with the telcos, who tell us that they want public tele-
vision’s digital content. But again, one way or the other, we need to ensure pub-
lic television is carried and every American has access. 
• Third,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  has  extended  its  agreement  with 
our  Association  under  which  we  have  conducted  a  pilot  project  to  develop  the 
Digital  Emergency  Alert  System  for  the  National  Capital  Region.  We  are  now 
entrusted  with  planning  the  national  rollout  of  the  D–EAS  using  digital  public 
television  stations  and  the  PBS  satellite  interconnection  system  as  the  back-
bone.  DHS  is  creating  a  system—through  the  dual  use  of  our  infrastructure— 
that  enables  the  President  to  communicate  instantly,  through  many  different 
communications devices, to the greatest number of Americans in a national cri-
sis.  We  are  requesting  an  authorization  to  fund  additional  connections  to  this 
backbone so that state and local authorities can also originate emergency alerts 
for distribution over the system. 
• Fourth, APTS urges the passage of S. 1023, the Digital Opportunity Investment 
Trust (DOIT), which was introduced this year with Senators Dodd, Snowe, Dur-
bin, and Burns as co-sponsors. DOIT proposes to use a portion of spectrum auc-
tion revenue to capitalize a trust fund, which would support the creation of dig-
ital  content  to  serve  the  education  needs  of  this  country.  This  proposal  is  the 
historical  descendant  of  the  Land  Grant  College  Act  and  the  GI  Bill,  both  of 
which led to monumental expansions in educational access for Americans.

• Finally, we hope the Senate will continue its historic, bipartisan role in support 
of  public  broadcasting.  The  Labor-HHS-Education  appropriations  bill  is  being 
marked  up  today,  and  we  urge  you  to  provide  full  funding  for  public  television 
and radio. It is a great investment in the digital transition. 

Thank you. 

APPENDIX A—HOW TO MAKE THE ‘‘HARD DATE’’ LESS HARD ON VIEWERS: A 

PROPOSED CONSUMER EDUCATION INITIATIVE BY PUBLIC TELEVISION STATIONS 

Public  Television  has  embraced  the  digital  transition  for  one  simple  reason:  we 
recognized  early  the  rich  dividends  in  expanded  services—from  HD  to  multicasting 
to  data-casting—that  digital  technology  would  make  possible  for  our  stations  to  de-
liver.  For  Public  Television,  the  transition  is  succeeding  on  the  provider  side,  but 
we fear the consequences for households relying on over-the-air (OTA) service if we 
fail to prepare them for the final chapter of the transition. 
The Problem: Shutting Off Analog Means Potentially Stranding Viewers 

Whether viewed from a political, economic, or public service perspective, stranding 
large  numbers  of  viewers  when  analog  signals  are  turned  off  is  an  outcome  all 
stakeholders  in  the  digital  transition  want  to  avoid.  It  is  estimated  that  up  to  22 
million  households  rely  exclusively  on  analog  service—and  that  those  households 
are disproportionately lower-income, rural, and/or elderly. 
The Solution: Public Television Stations Lead a Public Education Effort 

The  key  to  a  successful  transition  for  OTA  households  is  reaching  the  affected 
households  with  good  information.  With  nearly  90  million  viewers  tuning  in  each 
week,  and  nearly  70  percent  of  households  tuning  in  at  least  once  a  month,  Public 
Television  has  the  capacity  to  reach  nearly  every  American  affected  by  the  analog 
shut-off. 

We propose a public education effort that might include, but is not limited to: 
• The  creation  of  on-air  spots  to  alert  viewers  to  the  impending  analog  shut-off, 
explain  why  the  conversion  is  taking  place,  and  inform  them  of  the  steps  they 
can take to receive a digital signal by the shut-off date; 
• The creation of local non-broadcast outreach efforts aimed at educating targeted 
audiences about the transition, and the means to ensure continuation of service 
in a digital format; 
• Convening  local  partnerships,  including  retailers,  other  broadcasters,  consumer 
electronics  manufacturers,  and  social  service  organizations  to  reach  affected 
consumers throughout each community; 
• Serving as a local dissemination point of contact for set-top boxes (STBs) to eli-
• Provide  technical  assistance  for  consumers  to  help  ensure  they  can  install  the 

gible households as defined by Congress; and 

needed technology and receive over-the-air digital signals. 

Why Public Television? 

Public  Television  reaches  99  percent  of  the  American  public.  Moreover,  a  recent 
study  commissioned  by  the  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting  found  that  house-
holds dependent on over-the-air reception are more likely than others to be regular 
public television viewers. 

More importantly, we know we can effectively educate Americans about the value 
of  digital  broadcast  technology  because  we’ve  already  done  it.  Long  before  there 
were any transmitters up and operating: 

Sears, and Costco—who used them to promote HD and sell HDTV sets. 

• In  1998–99,  PBS  and  the  Harris  Corporation  created  the  DTV  Express,  a  66- 
foot  truck  carrying  a  fully  integrated  digital  television  station  and  HD  theater. 
The DTV Express traveled the country, providing seminars for state legislators, 
educators, funders, engineers, and consumers. 
• PBS  created  HD  spots  for  major  retailers—including  Best  Buy,  Circuit  City, 
• Local  stations  have  engaged  in  extensive  outreach  and  education  to  consumers 
and potential content providers—from the local Rotary club to the annual meet-
ing  of  the  National  Association  of  State  Universities  and  Land  Grant  Colleges. 
• PBS.org  features  a  special  DTV  section  including  a  layman’s  ‘‘crash  course’’  on 
DTV, local station guides, technical information, and related links. Local station 
websites are providing similar information.

Thanks  in  part  to  these  efforts,  Public  Television  has  raised  approximately  $1.1 
billion, including $479 million from state governments, to fund the digital build-out. 
We are grateful to have the Federal Government as a major partner in this regard; 
beginning  in  Fiscal  Year  2001,  Congress  has  appropriated  about  one-third  of  the 
funding raised to date. 
Americans Trust Their Local Public Television Stations 

Polling  consistently  confirms  the  high  degree  of  value  and  trust  that  Americans 
place  in  public  broadcasting.  At  a  time  when  we  are  asking  Americans  to  ‘‘sur-
render’’  a  technology  to  which  they  have  grown  accustomed,  and  embrace  a  new 
technology,  it  makes  sense  to  place  a  trusted,  local  institution  at  the  center  of  a 
comprehensive public education initiative. We see this as a natural extension of our 
public service mission. 

APPENDIX B 

LOOKING OUT FOR NUMBER TWO 

By Mark Schubin (May 2005) 

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, says U.S. analog TV may not be broadcast after 
December  31,  2006.  So  why  does  House  Commerce  Committee  head  Joe  Barton 
want new legislation with a ‘‘hard date’’? It’s because the 1997 Act has three excep-
tions. 

The  first  is  rarely  mentioned.  It  states  that,  if  an  ABC,  CBS,  Fox,  or  NBC  outlet 
is  legitimately  not  yet  broadcasting  digitally  by  the  end  of  2006,  no  station  in  its 
market need shut down its analog TV broadcasts. No one expects that. 

The third is often mentioned. It’s referred to as the ‘‘85 percent rule,’’ though that 
percentage doesn’t appear in the Act. It allows analog broadcasts to continue in any 
market  where  15  percent  of  households  or  more  do  not  have  digital  TV  reception 
equipment  and  also  don’t  subscribe  to  a  cable,  satellite,  or  other  service  providing 
signals from each digital station in that market. 

There  are  questions  about  whether  cable  systems  carry  each  TV  broadcaster  in 
all  markets.  Fifteen  markets  have  more  than  19  stations  each,  and  in  each  there 
are  stations  more  than  55  miles  from  the  center.  But  the  FCC  could  come  up  with 
a  definition  of  ‘‘market’’  that  eliminates  those  problems,  and  the  proportion  of  U.S. 
households  that  subscribe  to  a  multichannel  service  are  already  around  85  percent 
and growing. 

That leaves exception number two. Analog TV may continue in any market where 

‘‘digital-to-analog converter technology is not generally available.’’ 

The  FCC’s  ‘‘tuner  mandate’’  has  dramatically  increased  the  number  of  digital-TV 
receivers.  It  kicked  in  last  July  only  for  50  percent  of  TVs  larger  than  35-inches, 
and  by  year  end,  it  had  already  caused  a  150  percent  increase  in  digital-TV  recep-
tion devices. But that’s receivers, not converters. 

In  February  2004,  KCSM,  a  public-TV  station  in  San  Mateo,  CA,  found  out  that 
its  lease  on  its  analog  transmission  tower  would  not  be  renewed.  The  station  had 
been  broadcasting  digitally  since  September  2003,  and  was  in  a  market  that  had 
greater-than 80 percent cable penetration and 9 percent local-into-local satellite car-
riage. So they decided—pending FCC approval—to drop their analog transmissions. 
They  did  everything  right.  They  contacted  all  of  the  cable  and  satellite  systems 
serving their market to ensure continued carriage via their digital broadcasts. They 
contacted local retailers. They informed viewers of the impending change on the air 
and  via  their  website.  They  compiled  lists  of  receivers.  They  provided  reception  in-
structions.  They  trained  staff  to  field  inquiries  from  viewers.  Then,  in  late  May 
2004, they pulled the plug. 

Viewers  whose  screens  went  dark  overwhelmed  the  station  with  calls.  About  10 
percent  ‘‘would  not  be  consoled.’’  Another  45  percent  wanted  to  keep  watching  but 
didn’t want cable, satellite, or new equipment. The remaining 45 percent wanted to 
learn what they had to do to keep watching. So the station staff told them. 

Then,  according  to  KCSM  Director  of  Technology,  Michelle  Muller,  reporting  on 
the  experience  at  the  PBS  Technology  Conference  last  month,  the  station  got  a  dif-
ferent  kind  of  call.  A  local  retailer  begged  them  to  stop  sending  customers  over  be-
cause there was nothing to sell them. 

Consider a consumer electronics manufacturer’s position. The ‘‘tuner mandate’’ re-
quires TVs to be equipped with digital-reception circuitry, and most households sub-
scribe  to  cable  or  satellite  and,  therefore,  don’t  need  a  ‘‘digital-to-analog  converter.’’ 
So  why  build  and  distribute  them?  The  proportion  of  digital-TV  reception  provided 
by converters is steadily dropping.

ital cliff’’? 

51 

On  February  28,  the  FCC  Media-Bureau  staff  issued  a  report  indicating  that  a 
‘‘natural retirement’’ analog-TV shut-down date—when all analog sets wear out and 
are  replaced—would  be  2032.  As  for  KCSM,  they  lost  38  percent  of  their  audience. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all. 
I’m  going  to  have  some  written  questions  that  we’ll  submit  to 
you. I believe it would be best if we moved through to every mem-
ber, if possible, this morning. 

But I do have one question of Mr. Knorr. Tell me, what’s a ‘‘dig-

Mr.  KNORR.  A  ‘‘digital  cliff’’  is—the  digital  signals  work  dif-
ferently than the analog signals. You might think of it—people are 
more  familiar  with  cell  phones,  and  an  analog  cell  phone,  when 
you’re  on  the  edge  of  the  signal,  you  could  still  talk,  but  it  might 
be  fuzzy.  When  you  have  a  digital  cell  phone,  you  either  can  talk 
or you can’t. The signal just goes off. And that is what’s commonly 
referred  to  as  a  ‘‘digital  cliff,’’  is  that  it  either  works  or  it  doesn’t. 
There is no inbetween. There’s no little-bit-fuzzy with a digital sig-
nal. 

And  so,  a  cable  operator,  as  many  of  our  members  are,  that  are 
on the fringe of a broadcaster’s signal, they can receive that signal 
today, but it’s very likely that, when the conversion to digital hap-
pens, that signal will go away—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Oh, I see. 
Mr. KNORR.—and they will not be able to receive it. 
The CHAIRMAN. They would not receive the signal that would be 

digital, then, right? 

Mr. KNORR. Correct. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Even  though  they  were  receiving  analog,  even 

though maybe dimly, right? 

Mr. KNORR. Correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  If  there’s  no  objection,  we’ll  take  a  5-minute 

round. That’ll take us an hour. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Fritts,  before  I  proceed,  I  gather  that  this 
is  your  last  year  as  President  and  CEO.  If  that’s  the  case,  I  wish 
you very well. 

Mr. FRITTS. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you for all your service these past years. 

I appreciate it very much. 
Mr. FRITTS. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  You’re  presuming  we  won’t  get  him  up  here 

[Laughter.] 
Senator INOUYE. Mr. Lawson just spoke of the successful negotia-
tions he’s had, and you suggested that your broadcasters may have 
some  difficulty  because  you  compete  with  cable  operators.  Do  you 
have any evidence of this? 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Senator  Inouye,  we  have  met  with  the  cable  indus-
try,  at  the  request  of  some  members  of  this  committee,  on  several 
occasions, and have advanced the same ideas that we’re advancing, 
in  terms  of  multicasting,  and  have  been  soundly  turned  away  for 
that. And I think it’s for competitive reasons. 

again.

If a local station is able to offer new services—take, for instance, 
the  services  that  the  public  stations—arrangement  that  they  have 
made  with  the  cable  association.  They  are  no  threat  to  the  cable 
industry. They don’t compete. These are public stations that are of-
fering additional services. 

Many of the services that broadcasters would offer would be pre-
sumed to be somewhat competitive to the cable industry. The cable 
industry,  as  you  know,  owns  not  only  the  pipe,  but  they  also  own 
a  large  chunk  of  the  programming  that  goes  down  that  pipe;  and, 
therefore, it’s been difficult for us to get a dialogue started. 

And  what  we’re  proposing  is  the  same  amount  of  spectrum  be 
used  that  was  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  the  1992  Cable 
Act. And we believe that by not using more spectrum—and, in fact, 
less  spectrum  in  the  future—that  this  will  provide  additional  free 
services to the American consuming public. And I would think that 
ultimately would provide additional interest in cable carrying those 
signals. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. Knorr, do you wish to comment? 
Mr.  KNORR.  Yes.  We,  as  a  cable  operator,  someone  who’s  in  the 
field—I  like  more  local  content,  if  it’s  real  local  content.  That  is 
beneficial for me in a competitive environment. I mean, that’s why 
we  carry  PBS  Kids.  I  mean,  it’s  a  very  valuable—it’s  good-quality 
programming for our consumers. 

What we can’t afford to do with our spectrum is carry what may 
be  a  national  weather  feed  from  every  broadcaster  in  the  market 
that’s  completely  redundant,  or  to  carry  additional  shopping  chan-
nels from broadcasters, and use up that spectrum. And to say that 
we’re  going  to  use  less  spectrum  is  false.  Maybe  in  10  years,  we’ll 
use less spectrum. But, in the short term, it’s critical, as even NAB 
has  stated,  to  provide,  where  possible,  analog  and  digital  signals. 
I  mean,  that’s  a  competitive  advantage  that  we  want  to  do,  if  we 
have the capacity to do it. 

The  problem  that—as  a  cable  operator,  that  I  have  is,  we’ve 
spent millions of dollars to invest to create capacity to provide new 
and  advanced  services;  whereas,  broadcasters  have  been  granted 
spectrum,  and  then  granted  additional  spectrum  to  get  through 
this  transition  for  free.  And  then  now  they  are  trying  to  dictate 
what to do with the spectrum that we paid to install, and not give 
us the ability to manage that to the benefit of our consumers. 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Just  to  follow  up  on  that,  in  terms  of  multicasting, 
we have said that we would be glad to engage with the Committee, 
both  here  and  in  the  House,  to  provide  quantifiable  public-interest 
obligations on these multicast channels. And we would be happy to 
engage  in  that  dialogue  to  make  sure  that  these  services  that  are 
going to be offered are relevant to the local community and impor-
tant to all consumers. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Do  you  have  any  views  on  down-conversion  by 

cable operators? 

Mr. FRITTS. As we embrace this transition and go forward, what 
we’re  proposing  is  what  the  former  Chairman  of  NCTA  proposed, 
Michael  Willner,  in  testimony  before  Congress,  wherein  he  sup-
ported  legislation  and  positions  saying  that  analog  sets  should  be 
carried in analog and digital sets should be carried in digital as we 
go through this transition.

Ultimately,  the  transition  will  be  over,  analog  will  be  shut  off, 
presumably  at  a  date  in  2009.  And,  when  that  occurs,  obviously 
that spectrum goes back, much of it, to the cable industry, and, ob-
viously, a large amount, one-third of it, goes back for governmental 
purposes. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. McSlarrow, do you have any views? 
Mr. MCSLARROW. What happens when you get to the date of the 
transition  is  that,  as  Eddie  just  said,  an  analog  signal  goes  away 
and  a  digital  signal  comes  in.  So,  if  you’re  a  cable  operator,  you’re 
taking  a  digital  signal,  but  most  of  our  customers  today,  and  in 
2009, are going to be customers who can only receive an analog sig-
nal,  one  way  or  another.  So,  what  we  have  proposed  is  that  we 
down-convert  the  digital  signal  to  make  sure  everybody  who  has 
got an analog receiver is going to receive an analog signal. But re-
call  that  even  today  many  people  are  digital  cable  customers  and 
receive many digital channels. That will still be the case in the fu-
ture.  And,  in  fact,  it’ll  be  increasing  in  numbers.  And  many—and 
we’re  hoping  growing  numbers—receive  high  definition  today.  And 
that will continue to be the case, and into the future. 

So,  in  terms  of  our  proposal,  the  transition  is  seamless.  People, 

from 1 day before to the day after, will not notice a difference. 

There  is  a  semantic  difference  between  what  NAB  is  saying  and 
what  we’re  saying,  that  makes  all  the  difference  in  the  world. 
We’re saying, give us the flexibility to down-convert. We’re the ones 
who  have  to  respond  to  the  customer.  We  don’t  deliver,  they  go  to 
my  colleague  over  here,  two  steps  down.  So,  we  have  every  incen-
tive. The government can’t give us any more incentive to make this 
work right for our consumers. 

What  Eddie,  and  NAB  are  saying  is,  instead,  force  us  to  carry 
both  the  digital  signal  and  the  analog  signal  for  every  must-carry 
station  in  every  market  for  every  operator  in  America.  And  they 
don’t all have the capacity. 

Mr.  FRITTS.  And  we’re  not—if  I  could  follow  up  on  that—we’re 
not  suggesting  that  cable  systems  that  don’t  have  the  capacity  be 
burdened  with  this.  The  Supreme  Court  said  one-third  of  the  ca-
pacity  on  cable  carriage,  and  very  few,  if  any,  cable  systems  have 
approached  must-carry  of  up  to  one-third  of  channel  capacity  in 
this. And so, what we’re saying is, when the conversion date occurs, 
in  2009,  analog  signals  go  away,  and  then  it  all  becomes  digital, 
and  then  analog  spectrum  goes  back  to  the  government,  and  the 
cable  industry  recaptures  that  which  was  being  used  to  transmit 
the analog signals. 

Senator INOUYE. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes.  I  would  urge  that—I  assume  the  witnesses 
can  see  the  lights,  as  we  can  see  them,  I  hope,  but  we  are  on  a 
tight time frame here this morning, so I would hope that we’d stay 
within 5 minutes. 

Senator McCain? 
Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  am  concerned  about  a  lot  of  aspects  of  this  issue,  and  a  lot  of 
them are being explored by other questions, but I’m most concerned 
about  the  freeing-up  of  spectrum  for  first  responders.  Events  in 
London  indicated  that  this  should  reinforce  our  view  of  this  as  a 
compelling issue.

As  you  may  know,  I  served  on  the  Commission  that  the  Presi-
dent  appointed  to  examine  the  weapons  of  mass  destruction  issue. 
Every  witness  before  that  Commission  said  they  believed  there 
would  be  another  attack  on  the  United  States.  Today,  our  first  re-
sponders  do  not  have  the  ability  to  communicate  with  each  other. 
So, I have a simple question. And now we’re looking at December 
31, 2008, which is two and a half years from now. I’m not sure that 
the  United  States  of  America  can  wait  that  long.  I  have  one  ques-
tion for the panel. What do we need to do to free-up this spectrum 
for  first  responders  as  quickly  as  possible,  and  how  soon  can  that 
be? 

And I’ll begin with you, Mr. Lawson. 
Mr. LAWSON. Senator, I believe the key is to provide for a smooth 

transition for the over-the-air—— 

Senator MCCAIN. How long would that be, Mr. Lawson? 
Mr.  LAWSON.  Well,  we’re  not  afraid  of  an  end-of-2008  hard 

Senator MCCAIN. End of 2008. 
Mr. LAWSON.—but there has to be—I believe that even if you es-
tablish  a  hard  date,  it  could  fail.  You  could  end  up  pushing  that 
date  back  if  the  consumer  side  of  this  transition  is  not  carefully, 
carefully managed. 

Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Slenker? 
Mr.  SLENKER.  Senator,  we  would  agree  with  the  date  that  the 

Congress put forth, in terms of a hard date. I do—— 

Senator  MCCAIN.  You  know,  we’ve  had  hard  dates  before,  Mr. 

date—— 

Slenker. 

Mr.  SLENKER.  Yes,  and  what  I  was  going  to  say  is  that  I  think 
the hard facts of the matter are that there are hundreds of millions 
of  analog  television  sets  in  use  in  the  United  States.  And  so,  that 
date should—and I agree with you—should be based on a date that 
is  something  that  can  be  achieved,  while  also  providing  the  cov-
erage that’s required by consumers and the American public. 

Senator MCCAIN. Go ahead, Mr. Knorr. 
Mr.  KNORR.  I  think  we  could  support  an  end-of-2008  hard  date. 
The  issue  for  us  is—just  as  everybody  has  articulated—would  be 
consumers.  And  for—as  a  cable  operator,  if  we  have  the  flexibility 
to  manage  our  bandwidth  and  our  capacity,  I  think  we’ll  be  in  a 
good position to help manage that transition. 

Mr. MCSLARROW. If you told us today that we were going to move 
to  a  hard  date,  we’d  need  18  months  to  re-engineer  our  facilities 
to  do  down-conversion.  And  so,  we’ll  be  ready  whenever  you  set  a 
date. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  How  would  that  happen,  to  get  it  done  in  18 

months, Mr. McSlarrow? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Basically,  we  have  to  go  into  each  of  our  cable 
headends  and  re-engineer  them,  and  allow  for  the  digital  signal  to 
go analog out. Some clearly would happen earlier than 18 months, 
but  to  get  them  all  done  throughout  America  would  be  about  18 
months. 

Senator MCCAIN. And that would mean provision of set-top boxes 

for over-the-air television viewers? 

Mr. MCSLARROW. No. In this case, if we do it at the headend, we 
won’t have to do truck rolls, and it won’t require delivering set-top

boxes  to  each  consumer.  We  could  just—we  can  re-engineer  the 
cable headend to take care of all the customers delivered service by 
that headend. 

Mr. ABUD. Senator, we’re ready, and we support a hard date. But 
please  remember  that  the  hard  date  is  only  one  component  in  the 
big  puzzle  of  this  new  transition.  But,  as  far  as  a  broadcaster,  I’m 
currently broadcasting analog and digital. So—— 

Senator MCCAIN. Yes, I know you are. I know very well that you 
are.  In  fact,  you  will  continue  to  broadcast  analog,  which  is  what 
we  need  for  the  first  responders  now,  for  many,  many  years.  And 
if  the  85  percent  penetration  rule  continues,  as  Chairman  Powell 
stated  before  this  committee,  it  could  be  decades—decades  before 
we get the analog spectrum for the first responders. 

Mr.  Abud,  what  do  I  tell  the  Fire  Chief  and  the  Police  Chief  in 
my  home  state,  in  Phoenix,  Arizona?  What  do  I  tell  them?  That 
they’re  not  going  to  get  this  spectrum  that  they  need  to  commu-
nicate with each other until you decide that every ‘‘i’’ is dotted and 
every ‘‘t’’ is crossed? 

Mr. ABUD. Senator, we’re ready. And—— 
Senator MCCAIN. Tomorrow. 
Mr.  ABUD.  The  headend  is  only  one  part  of  this  puzzle,  but  we 

are ready—— 

Senator  MCCAIN.  You’re  ready  to  give  up  your  analog  spectrum 

tomorrow to the first responders. 

Mr.  ABUD.  In  most  of  the  stations  we  are,  and  we  will  be  ready 

by December 2008. 

Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Fritts? 
Mr.  FRITTS.  Senator  McCain,  we  understand  the  December  31, 
2008,  or  somewhere  in  2009,  hard  date.  We  assume  that  the  85 
percent  goes  away  as  a  part  of  the—enacting  legislation  that 
you’re—— 

Senator MCCAIN. Although you supported strongly the 85 percent 

rule as it was put in previously. 

Mr. FRITTS. That is true. And I will say to you—— 
Senator  MCCAIN.  Knowing  full  well  that  it  would  take  decades, 
as Chairman Powell stated, before there would be 85 percent pene-
tration? 

Mr. FRITTS. I will say to you that our board met just 3 weeks ago 
and indicated that we would accept a hard date, as selected by this 
committee,  and  understood  the  fact  that  when  that  hard  date  took 
place  the  85  percent  would  go  away.  And  that’s  the  position  that 
the NAB is taking now. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Burns? 
Senator  BURNS.  When  the  cables—Mr.  McSlarrow,  when  the  ca-
bles  talk  about—or  Mr.  Knorr—I  think—better  directed  at  him. 
You spoke awhile ago about free spectrum and the transition over. 
And  what  spectrum  do  you  use  in  a  cable  business  that  you  had 
to purchase? 

Mr. KNORR. What we have to do is, we have to invest in the elec-
tronic hardware that is installed in people’s backyards that deliver 
the signal to the homes. And those vary——

Senator  BURNS.  In  other  words,  when  you  talk  about  that,  you 
don’t talk about spectrum, you talk about capacity, as far as band-
width, is that correct? 
Mr. KNORR. Correct. 
Senator BURNS. In other words, you just buy a bigger pipe. 
Mr. KNORR. Well, we have to—yes, we have to upgrade our tech-
nology,  and  we  use  spectrum  up  to—cable  operators  use  it  up  to— 
one gigahertz is the spectrum we use, but it is confined to the wire 
and is not over-the-air spectrum. 

Senator  BURNS.  That’s  what  I  thought.  When  you  talk  about 

spectrum, you talk about bandwidth on a wire. 

Mr. KNORR. Correct. 
Senator  BURNS.  You  didn’t  purchase  that.  You  purchased  it  be-

cause you had to buy a bigger wire, more than anything else. 

Mr. KNORR. Correct. 
Senator  BURNS.  But  you’re  going  to  have  to  have  some  sort  of  a 
wire,  whether  it  be  optics  or  whether  it  be  cable  or  copper.  And, 
of  course,  all  of  that  is—the  old  copper  and  the  old  cable  is  gone. 
In other words, you’re in optics right now, and that’s where the fu-
ture  is,  because  that  gives  you  increased  capacity  without  increas-
ing  the  size  of  your  pipe.  And  that  sometimes  is—the  American 
public, they don’t understand that. Spectrum is—spectrum is what 
we use over-the-air. That’s what you buy, or that’s what you have. 
And that’s where I’m going. 

Mr.  KNORR.  I  think  an  important  consideration  is  that,  either 
way, it’s capacity. And just like the—a broadcaster could not broad-
cast  a  digital  and  analog  signal  on  the  capacity  they  had  15  years 
ago;  they  had  to  get  additional  capacity,  and  that’s  in  the  form  of 
over-the-air  spectrum.  And,  in  our  case,  that  additional  capacity  is 
in the form of more expensive wires and fiberoptics. 

Senator  BURNS.  If  they  operate  all  of  those  in  six  megahertz, 

does that impact on your capacity? 

Mr.  KNORR.  If  they  could  provide  the  analog  signal,  and  the  HD 
signal,  and  the  multicast  all  in  the  six  megahertz,  it  is  true  that 
it  would  not  impact  us.  However,  that  is  not  the  case.  It’s  mis-
leading  to  say  that  cable  gets  that  spectrum  back,  because,  as  Mr. 
McSlarrow  said,  the  customers  can—will  continue  to  have  analog 
sets  past  2009.  And  unless  you  want  to  increase  the  problem  and 
make it larger, cable operators need the flexibility to down-convert 
and to help make that problem smaller. 

Senator  BURNS.  But  could  they  operate  in  that  six  megahertz? 

Could you broadcast an analog and a—— 

Mr. KNORR. No. 
Senator BURNS.—digital signal in that six megahertz? 
Mr. KNORR. No, we cannot. 
Senator BURNS. OK. 
The CHAIRMAN. Can I ask a question? It won’t—— 
Senator BURNS. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN.—come off your time. Won’t you be sending a dig-

ital signal to your digital subscribers at the same time? 

Mr. KNORR. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. But you say—— 
Mr. KNORR. But we’d need additional capacity to do——

The  CHAIRMAN.  When  a  broadcast  signal  comes  through,  it  has 

to be down-graded to analog. 

Mr.  KNORR.  For  it  to  reach  analog  sets,  we’d  have  to  down-con-
vert  it,  so  that’s  all  I—that’s  our  spectrum  problem,  is,  we  have  to 
send out multiple signals to our customers. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  What  about  the  subscribers  out  there  that  have 

gone digital? 

Mr.  KNORR.  We  would  send  out  a  digital  signal  to  them,  where 

we have the capacity to do—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Digital  for  the  over-the-air/must-carry  group. 
You  say  you  would  downgrade  the  analog  signal.  So  it  would  be 
passed through only as analog, right? 

Mr. KNORR. I’m sorry? 
Mr. MCSLARROW. Mr. Chairman? 
The CHAIRMAN. Isn’t that right? Am I hearing right? 
Mr.  MCSLARROW.  You  are  right.  I  mean,  what  we’re  suggesting 
is  that  we  take  the  digital  signal  and,  for  the  analog  customers, 
down-convert  it  to  analog.  The  digital  customers  are  going  to  re-
ceive many of the same digital signals they receive today. 

The CHAIRMAN. But are you transmitting that over-the-air broad-

casted digital signal to that digital—— 

Mr. MCSLARROW. In most cases, yes—and increasing. 
The CHAIRMAN. In most cases. 
Mr.  MCSLARROW.  In  most  cases.  And  there  may  be  a  station 
somewhere,  where  we  don’t  have  enough  capacity  to  do  both,  but 
it  is  our  intent  today,  just  as  we  do  today,  to  continue  doing  both. 

The CHAIRMAN. I’m sorry. Mr. Burns? 
Senator  BURNS.  I’m  going  to  sit  here  and  listen,  because  I’m— 
I would turn back the balance of my time. I’ve just got some ques-
tions that have to be asked, sort of, privately, so go to the next per-
son. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  You  shouldn’t  say  that.  You  shouldn’t  say  that. 

That’s—— 

DeMint. 

Senator BURNS. Why? If they can be private, I can be private. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir, you may. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  You’re  the  boss.  Sorry  to  interrupt  you,  though. 

I didn’t mean to interrupt your train of thought. 

Senator BURNS. No, I’ve got—go to the next guy. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  All  right.  The  next  person,  then,  is  Senator 

Senator DEMINT. Senator Burns, I probably should ask mine pri-

vately, too—— 
[Laughter.] 
Senator DEMINT.—because I’ll show my ignorance here. 
But I’m trying to imagine the industry in a few years, with a lot 
of  new  technology.  I  know  Mr.  Fritts  is—one  of  the  issues  that’s 
difficult  for  you  is  the  required  multicast  on  cable,  DIRECTV.  But 
you will continue—broadcasters will continue to broadcast a digital 
signal.  Am  I  correct?  I  mean,  it  will  be  a  broadcast  signal  that  I 
could still receive at my home with digital receiver capabilities, cor-
rect? 

Mr. FRITTS. That’s correct, yes, sir.

Senator  DEMINT.  In  the  future,  if  I  wanted  to  be  hooked  up  to 
my  local  cable  operator  to  receive  all  the  channels  I  wanted,  but 
also  have  a  little  switch  where  I  could  receive  ten  multicast  sta-
tions  from  my  local  NBC  affiliate,  that  that  technology  is  not  dif-
ficult, correct? 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Depending  on  whether  you  get  close  enough  to  the 

television station to get a good signal, that’s correct. 

Senator  DEMINT.  Right.  If  I’m  within—whatever—I  can  receive 
that. So, it sounds like with—in the future, that if I want multicast 
local  television  programming,  if  I  want  to  receive  dozens  of 
multicasts  from  my  local  affiliates,  that  I  could  easily  have  that 
technology  available,  if,  as  a  consumer,  I  wanted  it,  at  no  addi-
tional cost to myself, because you’re going to continue to broadcast 
that digitally. Is that correct? 
Mr. FRITTS. That is correct. 
Senator DEMINT. OK. So, the argument that we must force these 
cable folks to carry five or ten stations from all broadcasters, in my 
mind,  is  somewhat  questionable  that  that  needs  to  be  a  govern-
ment  mandate  if,  as  a  consumer,  I  can  receive  it  free,  with  prob-
ably a little additional technology at home. 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Senator  DeMint,  you  have  the  same  situation  today 
that  this  committee  and  this  Congress,  in  1992,  looked  at  and 
thought  that  there  was  a  governmental  interest  in  carrying  local 
television stations on the cable system. And it went to the Supreme 
Court. 

Senator DEMINT. You’re talking about primary carry. 
Mr. FRITTS. I’m talking about the carriage. And what we’re talk-
ing  about  now  is  not  increasing  the  bandwidth  or  the  space  that’s 
used;  we’re  talking  about—when  we  are  all  digital—let’s  say,  in 
2009—we’re  talking  about  returning  all  of  our  analog  spectrum, 
which is a third of what we use now; plus, the cable gets additional 
spectrum, because we are taking the analog signal off of cable, be-
cause we’re broadcasting only digitally. 

Senator  DEMINT.  Right.  But  you  are  talking  about  using  the 
transition to digital as a way to get additional requirements of sta-
tions  that  you  broadcast  imposed  on  cable  and  DIRECTV.  I  mean, 
this was—— 

Mr. FRITTS. It’s the same amount of space. If we wanted to slice 
that  space  up  and  have  one  HDTV  channel,  it  uses  the  same 
amount  of  space.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  broadcaster  wanted  to 
provide  additional  services  for  the  local  community—and,  again, 
we’ve agreed that we would be happy to sit down and discuss quan-
tifiable  public-interest  obligations  of  broadcasting  local  services  for 
that—so, we’re using the same amount of spectrum, we’re just slic-
ing it, for a period of time, to multicast. 

Senator DEMINT. I understand. Thank you, sir. 
I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

The  questions  from  Senator  Inouye,  I  thought,  got  the  folks  en-
gaged  in  trying  to  get  this  into  a  practical  understanding  for  us, 
as well as the questions of Senator DeMint. 

My  goal,  by  the  way,  in  all  of  this,  is  to  get  to  wireless 
broadband,  which  I  think  is  very  important  for  rural  areas.  And  I 
understand the needs for public safety and so forth, but I think the 
innovations  and  the  technology  advancements,  particularly  in  get-
ting  wireless  broadband  into  rural  areas—for  that  matter,  any-
where  else—as  another  option  is  the  most  compelling  reason  for 
this. 

Hearing  all  the  witnesses  here,  they’re  all  for  a  general  hard 
date,  as  opposed  to—including  listening  to  Mr.  Fritts  and  the  3- 
week-old position of the National Association of Broadcasters—and 
just  having  a  hard  date,  rather  than  some  quantifiable  level  of  ca-
pabilities  for  customers,  consumers,  to  receive  over-the-air  broad-
casting,  which  gets  to  the  main  problem  that  I—you’re  all  talking 
about  all  of  your  different  angles  and  what’s  your  competitive  ad-
vantage,  one  way  or  the  other.  And  I  understand.  I  don’t  like  gov-
ernment  mandates.  I’m  thinking,  though,  of  how  many  television 
sets  right  now  are  not  capable  of  receiving  digital  broadcasts, 
whether  via  cable,  via,  obviously,  over-the-air,  and,  I  suppose,  as 
well, on satellite. 

The  reality  is,  my  household  is  probably  like  many  others  who 
receive  cable,  and  that  is,  you  have  certain  TVs  that  are  on  cable, 
and you have some TVs that are over-the-air. In your family room, 
it’s cable. Maybe your bedroom, it’s cable. But then, in the kitchen, 
the  guest  bedroom,  so  forth,  if  you  have  a  little  TV,  it’s  over-the- 
air. 

So,  if  you  could—our  experts  here,  could  you  share  with  us  just 
the very practical problem of not wanting TVs to go off. If you want 
an  uproar  from  the  people  of  this  country,  have  their  TVs  go  off. 
And I find it very interesting that the date for this is December 31, 
2008,  as  opposed  to  the  Summer  of  2008,  where  you  know  darn 
well  what  the  issue  would  be,  in  all  of  those  elections.  And  it’s 
about  a  bunch  of  irate  people  who,  whether  they  live  in  cities  or 
out  in  the  country,  are  upset  that  this  isn’t  working  out,  or  you 
have folks coming in, putting set-top boxes on. 

So,  here’s  what  we  need  to  solve.  How  can  we  make  sure  that 
these  investments  that  people  have  made  in  these  TV  sets—and, 
unfortunately,  TV  sets  are  being  sold,  today,  that  are  not  digital- 
capable.  I  understand  the  marketplace.  The  reason  for  it  is  that 
those  digital  TV  sets  cost  substantially  more  than  an  analog  set, 
so people make that decision. 

If  any  of  you  could  share  with  the  Committee  and  the  American 
people  how  many  TVs  right  now—if  this  were  done,  let’s  say,  next 
month,  how  many  TVs  would  not  be  capable  of  receiving  a  digital 
signal?  And  then,  what  is  a  practical  way  that  we  can  absolutely 
ensure, as best we can, logically—and we’re never—it’s never going 
to be perfect, especially when the Government’s involved—but, how 
can we assure that, when this date occurs, you’re not going to have 
a lot of people with sets that they turn on, on that morning of Jan-
uary 1, New Year’s Day, not on for broadcast airwaves?

Mr. FRITTS. We have done some research on that, Senator Allen, 
and what we’ve learned is that there are roughly 20 million homes 
that are not connected to cable or to satellite. 

Senator ALLEN. How many television sets are not? 
Mr.  FRITTS.  Seventy-three  million  television  sets  are  unwired  in 
today’s  marketplace.  We  have  entered  into  a  joint  venture  to  help 
build—or  to  help  get  an  RFP  started  to  build  a  converter  box  that 
will  convert  those  over-the-air  sets  and  make  them  digital-capable 
through  the  converter  box.  Now,  they’re  analog  sets  with  a  con-
verter  box  that’ll  down-convert  the  digital  signal,  and  hopefully  in 
the $50 to $70 price range. 

There  has  been  a  discussion  at  this  table—and  in  the  House,  as 
well—about  some  form  of  taking  some  of  the  money  from  the  auc-
tions  and  providing  that  for  a  subsidy.  Our  position  on  that  is  to 
leave  that  to  you,  Members  of  Congress,  as  to  determine  best  how 
to go about that. 

The  numbers  that  we’re  quoting  are  also  essentially  the  same 
numbers  the  GAO  is  reporting,  and  also  the  same  numbers  that 
the Consumer Federation reported. Actually, the Consumer Federa-
tion was a little higher than ours. 

So,  if,  on  January  1,  2009,  all  analog  broadcasting  ceased,  we 
would have to have an education campaign in advance of that. We 
would have to have converter boxes—which, by the way, we’re will-
ing to undertake—over-the-air radio and television is willing to un-
dertake this campaign to help assure that Americans—— 

Senator  ALLEN.  Let  me  interrupt,  because  my  time  is  running 

Mr. McSlarrow talked about the down-converting as—that’s only 
going  to  work,  though,  for  those  television  sets  that  are  actually 
hooked  up  to  the  cable.  It  seems  to  me  a  logical  approach.  What’s 
your  view  on  allowing  them  to  do  that,  rather  than  having  to  put 
boxes on sets that are hooked up to cable? 

Mr.  FRITTS.  As  long  as  all  stations  in  the  marketplace  are  cov-

out. 

ered, we agree with that. We think it makes sense. 

Mr. ABUD. Senator, just quickly, if I may? 
Senator ALLEN. Sure. 
Mr. ABUD. Just remember that in the case of the Hispanic audi-
ence,  43  percent  of  my  audience  rely  on  over-the-air  television. 
And,  ironically,  this  segment  of  the  population  relies  more  on  the 
services we provide as a local television station. 

Senator  ALLEN.  So,  you  would  see  this  as  a  practical  problem, 
going  into  those  households  of  your  population  that  you’re  talking 
about, and putting in boxes—set-top boxes. 

Mr. ABUD. Yes. 
Senator ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time’s up.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And  I,  like  Senator  McCain,  have  a  variety  of  areas  of  interest 

in this, but none more important than the first-responder. 

The year 2008—and I agree with the Constitutional State of Vir-
ginia  Senator’s  analysis,  it’s  a  little  unsettling.  Some  could—said 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

61 

you could do that before that, but we need to free up spectrum for 
first  responders.  I  don’t  know  how  many  people  think  that  there 
will  be  an  attack  on  this  country  before  2008,  or  before  2007,  but 
my guess would be it’s a majority of people, who know what they’re 
talking about. And so, this isn’t just, kind of, a telecommunications 
discussion; this is a question of questions, bottom-line matters. It’s 
also  a  question  of  national  responsibility,  national  security,  which 
changes the whole debate. 

So,  to  me,  we  need  to  have  a  significant  portion  of  the  spectrum 
proceeds  to  be  set  aside  for  first  responders,  some  of  whom  are— 
just don’t have the infrastructure—or maybe I should say, many of 
whom don’t have the infrastructure to be able to receive what they 
will  need.  And  so,  you  know,  I  fully  support  making  first  respond-
ers in New York City and Los Angeles fully able. I also know very 
well  the  situation  in  my  own  state,  which  is  a  highly  rural  one, 
where  first  responders  cannot  communicate  with  each  other.  I’ve 
met  with,  I  think,  virtually  all  of  them  and—in  the  counties—and 
some  of  them  still  use  911  when  they’re  trying  to  get  attention. 
And  I  don’t  like  that.  I  don’t  know  how  much  money’s  going  to  be 
available,  in  terms  of  the  spectrum.  Senator  McCain’s  bill  talked 
about a billion dollars. That was a good start on it. But the auction 
of  the  broadcast  spectrum  provides  an  opportunity  to  be  able  to 
help  some  of  these  first  responders.  And  I’m  interested  in  the  dif-
ference between the need to help them and the question of running 
a business, and how those two may or may not conflict. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  having  this  hearing  today.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  know 

we have a number of witnesses before us today so I will be very brief. 

I  support  the  adoption  of  a  hard  date  of  January  1,  2009,  as  you  have  suggested 
for  completing  the  digital  television  transition.  I  believe  that  we  must  move  as 
quickly as possible to free-up the broadcast spectrum for our first responders. 

As importantly as freeing-up spectrum for first responders is, I believe we should 
seriously consider setting aside a significant portion of the proceeds of the spectrum 
auction for grants to first responders for emergency communications equipment and 
infrastructure. 

I  fully  support  making  sure  first  responders  in  urban  areas  have  the  spectrum 
they need, but for West Virginia, at least, the biggest obstacle to creating an inter-
operable public safety communications network is not available spectrum, but rath-
er  available  funds  for  equipment  purchase.  I  know  our  Co-Chairman  knows  very 
well the tightness of the budget for the foreseeable future. The auction of the broad-
cast  spectrum  provides  a  source  of  funding  that  our  first  responders  urgently  need. 
Much of the discussion today will center on how to make sure consumers are not 
left  in  the  dark  after  the  transition  to  digital  television.  I  believe  that  the  Com-
mittee  should  create  as  a  robust  consumer  subsidy  plan  as  necessary  to  make  sure 
no one will lose their over-the-air signals. 

Finally,  I  believe  the  Committee  needs  to  address  the  size  of  the  blocks  of  spec-
trum  that  will  be  auctioned  off  from  the  transition.  Because  spectrum  is  sold  in 
large  blocks,  my  state  often  does  not  see  the  level  of  investment  in  wireless  tech-
nologies  as  it  might  otherwise.  I  believe  we  need  to  allocate  smaller  blocks  of  spec-
trum  so  smaller  companies  in  rural  areas  can  purchase  spectrum  to  build  wireless 
networks where larger national companies choose to not to invest. 

Again,  thank  you  for  holding  this  important  set  of  hearings,  and  I  look  forward 

to hearing from our panel. 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Well,  Senator,  I’ll  take  a  crack  at  it.  I  think— 
the  way  I  think  about  this  is,  there  are  really  two  large  groups  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

62 

people out there who are affected by the transition, in terms of the 
spectrum—— 

The CHAIRMAN. They can’t hear you in the back of the room. 
Mr. MCSLARROW. Is that better? OK. 
Two  groups  of  people.  One  are  the  over-the-air  customers  of 
broadcasters.  The  other  are  cable  and  satellite.  There  is  one  set  of 
issues  related  to  those  customers  who  are  over-the-air.  But,  in  our 
case,  there  are  really  two  ways  of  coming  at  this.  If  the  spectrum 
goes  away  for  the  public  safety  purposes  you  just  identified,  which 
we  all  in  this  room  acknowledge  are  important,  either  you  can 
hand  everybody  a  box—$67  for  a  box,  for  a  cheap  digital-to-analog 
converter,  $200  for  a  fully  interactive  two-way  box—or  you  can 
allow the cable industry to spend its own money and down-convert 
at the headend. And the difference is, if you had to hand everybody 
a  box,  it  would  be  about  $9  billion.  Some  of  that,  most  of  that, 
would  probably  have  to  be  subsidized  by  the  government,  because 
there’s  no  principled  reason  why  a  cable  customer  should  not  re-
ceive  a  subsidy  if  over-the-air  customers  are  receiving  a  subsidy. 
We’re proposing a solution that means you don’t have to deal with 
that at all. We’ll take care of it. 

So, that’s the tradeoff, in terms of the two types of universes that 
you  have  as  a  business  matter,  taking  into  account  the  important 
public policies that you’ve identified. 

The CHAIRMAN. For the information of everyone, this afternoon— 
that  covered  system  there—we  will  demonstrate  the  signal  that 
will come over on analog or on digital to—this afternoon. 

Mr.  SLENKER.  Currently,  DIRECTV,  as  part  of  its  service,  pro-
vides  boxes  that,  in  fact,  do  this.  And  we  provide  that  equipment 
today for free, as a part of this monthly subscription that takes the 
local  channels  in  the  130-plus  markets  and  analog-to-digital  con-
verts  them,  so  that,  on  a  regular  analog  set  at  home,  a  digitized 
version  of  the  local  stations  are  there.  And  I’d  like  to  think  that’s 
part of the growth that satellite has experienced. It hasn’t all come 
from cable; it’s come from some over-the-air folks that now are able 
to  get  good,  crisp,  digital  signals  of  their  over-the-air  stations  lo-
cally, now through this satellite technology. 

Mr.  KNORR.  I  think  there  is  an  important  piece  that  is  almost 
whizzing by. A lot of times—NAB’s numbers, when they talk about 
cable getting spectrum back, or they talk about only this many mil-
lion  customers  being  affected,  they’re  overlooking—both  of  those 
can’t  be  true  at  the  same  time.  If  only  that  many  customers  are 
going to be affected, cable has to have the opportunity to down-con-
vert  and  offer  signals  to  those  analog  customers  that  don’t  have  a 
box, or else that problem becomes infinitely larger, as much as ten-
fold. 

To  use  your  example,  those  TVs,  if  you’re  a  cable  customer, 
they’re  not  being  counted  in  NAB’s  numbers,  because  you  have 
cable,  so  obviously  you  have  those  signals.  And,  through  cable,  if 
we  can  down-convert  and  continue  to  provide  analog  signal,  you 
can  get  those—you  can  hook  those  up  to  cable.  I  mean,  that’s  the 
advantage of cable. 

In rural markets, some of those systems don’t have the capacity, 
and  they  may  even  need  assistance  to  down-convert  those  signals, 
but those customers will not suffer, as NAB describes, by not being

63 

able  to  get  the  digital  signal,  because  of  my  friend  to  the  left.  I 
mean,  those  markets  are  competitive.  If  a  cable  operator  doesn’t 
have  the  capacity  to  offer  those  digital  signals,  they  can  still  get 
those  digital  signals,  and  that  becomes  a  free-market  competitive 
issue to determine whether or not that cable operator can afford to 
upgrade its capacity. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  OK,  can  I—Mr.  Chairman,  can  I  just— 
thank you for allowing me to interrupt and point out that the fund-
ing  for  first  responders  is  about  a  half-billion  dollars,  so  far,  less 
than  it  was  last  year.  So,  I  think  this  is—puts,  in  some  conflict, 
bottom-line thinking and national need. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Ensign? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Senator ENSIGN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  want  to  make  a  couple  of  points,  and  then  get  to  a  couple  of 

quick questions. 

You know, if we’re looking at this from the consumer standpoint, 
in  my  mind,  the  more  free-market  this  is,  the  less  government- 
mandated it is. The bottom line, the consumer’s going to benefit in 
the end. We do have some national security concerns with the first 
responders,  especially  today,  that  indicate  the  importance  of  free-
ing-up this spectrum. As far as jobs in the United States, the inno-
vation  that  can  happen  if  this  spectrum  is  freed  up,  we  can’t  even 
imagine  the  type  of  technologies  that  will  develop  when  this  spec-
trum  is  freed  up.  There  are  a  lot  of  compelling  reasons.  And  I’m 
glad  to  hear  everybody—that  everybody  is  for  a  hard  date  today, 
and  we  need  to  make  that,  and  we  need  to  stick  to  a  hard  date. 
And I think some of the concerns that we’ve heard today about— 
Senator  Allen,  when  you  talked  about  making  sure  that  nobody’s 
set  is  turned  off.  A  lot  of  this,  and  almost  all  of  it,  is  really  just 
a technology issue. It really is. None of those sets need to be turned 
off with a hard date. It’s a question of how, though, we do the sub-
sidy,  how  we  get  those  converter  boxes  to  those  analog  televisions. 
And I believe that all of that can be worked out amongst the Com-
mittee, as we move forward with a bill. 

What  I  want  to  get  to  is,  because  we’ve  heard  about  this  down- 
conversion,  and  there  are  different  issues,  from  what  I  under-
stand—down-conversion  cable  versus  satellite.  Because  we  heard 
about  the  capacity  on  this  must-carry.  We’ve  heard  the  broad-
casters  say  that  they  want  basically  the  same  amount  of  spectrum 
that they have today. When they give up the analog spectrum, they 
just  want  the  same  amount  of  spectrum  they  now  have  on  cable. 
From  what  I  understand,  especially  with  satellite,  that’s  different. 
You’re  going  to  need—if  you  have  that  down-conversion,  you’re 
going  to  have  limitations,  when  you  down-convert,  on  what  you 
could  carry.  And  it  would  hurt  local-in-local  programming  on  the 
satellite  if  all  of  these  must-carry  channels  were  required  for  you. 

Mr. Slenker, could you address that? 
Mr.  SLENKER.  That’s  absolutely  correct,  Senator.  I  think,  as 
we’ve  pointed  out,  we  have  fixed  licensed  spectrum  for  satellite, 
and we literally count the amount of digital bits today that we can 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

fit  into  that  fixed  spectrum.  We  use  state-of-the-art  compression 
technology to maximize the number of local stations in a spot-beam 
market-by-market fashion, to squeeze as many markets within the 
United States with the full number of stations in that market. But 
should we be required to carry additional content in those markets, 
that will exceed the available—not only the available spectrum, but 
also the state-of-the-art, in terms of technology. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  I  want  to  explore  this  whole  must-carry,  you 
know,  today  versus  what  the  broadcasters  would  like  to  see  in  the 
future. Mr. Fritts, your—let’s just say, for instance, that some kind 
of  compromise  was  reached,  and,  instead  of  everything  that  you 
want, there was, you know, one or two stations, or whatever, addi-
tional that you were putting in the pipe. And a lot of the argument 
has  been  because  of  local  programming.  OK?  Would  you  support, 
for instance, say, something like that, if a compromise was reached, 
an additional station, or whatever it was, that the 80 percent of the 
content  is  original  local  programming—that  kind  of  a  test  for  that 
addition? 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Senator  Ensign,  I  think  what  we  would  be  happy  to 
do  is  sit  down  and  figure  out  what  makes  sense,  what  the  right 
number  is.  I  don’t  know  if  it’s  80,  or  50,  or  40,  or  whatever  the 
right number is. But, please understand, we would be happy to sit 
down  and  guarantee  that  there  would  be  quantifiable  public-inter-
est  obligations  on  those  additional  channels  that  would  be  under 
the multicasting rules. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  The  reason  I  bring  this  up  is  because  I  think 
that  the  consumers  are  really  the  ones  who  will  make  the  choice 
in  the  future.  In  other  words,  if—you  know,  the  consumer’s  not 
going  to  want  82  shopping  channels  or  82  weather  channels,  or 
whatever  it  is,  and—because  I  guarantee  if  cable—if  the  consumer 
wanted  it,  and  cable  wasn’t  providing  it,  these  satellite  guys  will. 
And  if  the  consumer—if  your  content  is  good  enough,  if  your  de-
mand  is  good  enough,  they’re  going  to  have  to  carry  it.  And  it 
would  seem  to  me  that  the  consumers  making  the  choice  when 
we’re  going  through,  that’s—we  should  not  be  picking  the  winners 
and  losers  here.  We  should  be  allowing  the  consumer  to  pick  the 
winners and losers amongst you, and let you all compete. And, you 
know, some of you might have a little bloody nose at the end of the 
day, but the bottom line is, is that’s what a free market is supposed 
to  be  about,  is  government  not  picking  the  winners  and  losers,  or 
at least as much as possible. 

Now, we are making a transition—and there are always winners 
and losers when you go in a transition area—but, in the future, we 
need  to  get  out  of  this  business,  as  much  as  possible,  and  let  you 
all compete, as much as we possibly can. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  that  in  the  future,  as  we  go  to  this—you 
know,  determining  the  subsidy,  that  is  something  that  we’re  going 
to  have  to  determine.  You  know,  should  it  be  a  government  fund? 
Should  it  be  a  private  grant  out  there  that  people  can  apply  to? 
Should  it  be  means  tested?  Should—all  of  those  issues  need  to  be 
addressed,  because  I  don’t  believe  that,  you  know,  people  like  my-
self—maybe  I  do  have  a—you  know,  a  set  in  the  back,  you  know, 
that—I don’t think that I should get a government subsidy just be-
cause  I  have  to—if  I  want  one  of  my  analog  sets  to  have  a  con-

verter  box—you  know,  whether  they’re  $40,  $50,  $60—I  just  don’t 
think  that  somebody  in  upper  income  should  have  a  subsidy.  But, 
for  some  people,  for  some  seniors  who,  necessarily,  can’t  afford  it, 
some  kind  of  subsidy  should  be  available  for  those.  And  the  tech-
nology, then, would take care of that. 

So, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Snowe? 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Well,  obviously,  there  is  a  governmental  interest  in  this  whole 
process,  because  the  Government  is  requiring  people  to  make  in-
vestment  in  digital  television,  of  some  kind  with  this  hard-fast 
date, for the obvious, you know, good public-policy reasons, because 
we need the spectrum for first responders, and otherwise. 

My  concern  is  continuing  to  preserve  the  free  over-the-air  tele-
vision, and whether or not we’re going to undermine local program-
ming  on  the  question  of  whether  or  not  cable  is  required  to  carry 
multicasting  programming.  And,  really,  that’s  the  essence  for  me, 
because,  in  the  final  analysis,  we  have  to  ensure  that  local  pro-
gramming continues. 

Frankly,  I  don’t  happen  to  think  it  should  be,  sort  of,  an  option. 
I  realize  you’d  have  to,  you  know,  download  the  analog  signal,  but 
I’m trying to figure out what is the picture in the future. 

And  I  would  like  to  start  with  you,  Mr.  Fritts.  What  is  the  pic-
ture in the future if cable is not required to carry multicasting pro-
gramming? What would that mean for local programming, primary 
broadcasters, from your standpoint? 

Mr.  FRITTS.  If  cable  were  not  required  to  carry  any  of  the 

multicast channels—— 

Senator SNOWE. Right. 
Mr.  FRITTS.—67  percent  of  the  households,  presumably,  would 
never get a chance to sample those, never get a chance to see them, 
never  know  that  they  are  there.  And,  while  there  are  70  million 
sets  in  20  million  households,  probably  not  enough  to  sustain  a 
substantial market. 

Currently,  if  public  interest  obligations  were  imposed  on  local 
broadcasters, which they are currently under the governmental in-
terest and must-carry regime, what we’re saying is, actually, when 
we turn the analog off, and cable compresses the six megahertz, it 
becomes  three  megahertz;  and  so,  they  get  50  percent  back  at  the 
end of the transition. And what we’re saying is that if there is local 
programming  that  deserves  to  be  shown  by  local  people,  then  the 
local cable monopoly ought to carry it. 

Think  about  this.  Comcast  owns  everything  on  the  eastern  sea-
board,  with  the  exception  of  Fairfax  County.  Cable  has  a  very 
strong monopoly position. They can tell a broadcaster what gets on 
and  what  doesn’t  get  on  in  this  current  regime.  There’s  only  one 
cable operator in all of these regions, and there are not two in Fair-
fax County, there are not two in these areas up and down the east-
ern  seaboard.  So,  with  their  monopoly  power,  we  think  that  it’s 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

66 

only fair that local broadcasting be continued and furthered by vir-
tue of must-carry. 

Mr. ABUD. If I may, Senator, in the case of Spanish-language tel-
evision,  we  have  a  very  close  relationship  with  our  audience.  We 
provide  them  with  news  and  information  locally  that  they  cannot 
get anywhere else. By not forcing the cable companies to carry our 
signals,  we  will  be  keeping  the  benefits  of  digital  television  from 
the  consumer.  And,  you  know,  because  of  that  relationship  that 
we’ve established with our audience, we think that’s crucial for this 
segment of the population. 

Senator SNOWE. Mr. McSlarrow? 
Mr. MCSLARROW. Senator, I will avoid the use of the tired, hack-
neyed  term  ‘‘monopoly,’’  which  everybody  throws  around.  The  fact 
is,  the  only  person  who  can  actually  force  carriage  on  anyone  is  a 
broadcaster  forcing  must-carry  on  cable.  It’s  interesting,  cable  net-
works can go up to a broadcaster and say, ‘‘Hey, carry me. The law 
tells you to.’’ So, that’s the state of the law. We live with it. 

In  the  future,  with  multicasting,  what’s  not  being  said  today  is 
that  we  have  an  agreement,  as  John  Lawson  said,  with  the  public 
television  stations  all  around  the  country  to  carry  their  multicast 
signals.  We  carry,  today,  500  multicast  signals  around  the  Nation. 
It’s  all  voluntary.  We  have  C–SPAN  cameras  here  that  the  cable 
industry funded as a public-interest obligation. 

Senator SNOWE. But I understand—— 
Mr. MCSLARROW. It’s all voluntary. 
Senator  SNOWE.  Yes,  I  understand  that.  But,  in  the  absence  of 
any  requirements,  what  ultimately  happens?  That’s  optional.  It’s 
voluntary. But if the Government views that there’s a public inter-
est  in  continuing  free  over-the-air  television,  that  you  have  local 
programming,  where  does  that  stand  in  the  long-term  future,  be-
yond  2009?  And  it  is  no  different  than  the  1992  Cable  Act,  when 
we required a must-carry provision. I’m not sure I see a major dis-
tinction  in  that  regard.  We’re  just  moving  to  an  advanced  stage  of 
technology now, that we’re requiring, we’re imposing on consumers. 
But  yet  we  don’t  want  to  lose  the  public  interest  of  having  free 
over-the-air television. 

That’s what I’m grappling with here, because I really do see that 

as the essence—— 

Mr. MCSLARROW. I don’t think—— 
Senator SNOWE.—of what it’s all about. 
Mr.  MCSLARROW.—I  don’t  think  anybody  disagrees  with  the  im-
portance  of  over-the-air  broadcasting.  And  I  have  no  doubt  that  it 
will maintain a viable presence in the future. And I have no doubt 
that,  just  as  we  do  today,  voluntarily,  we  will  increasingly  carry 
multicast  signals  from  many  commercial  broadcasters,  as  well  as 
the  public  television  stations  around  the  country.  That  is  a  dif-
ferent thing from saying that, in every circumstance, multicast car-
riage should be mandated. 

Mr.  KNORR.  I’d  like  to  even  further  expand  on  that.  Where  we 
see—I  mean,  there  are  many  broadcasters  that  barely  make  the 
minimum  requirements  for  local  content  today  with  their  primary 
signal.  In  addition,  as  the  question  was  asked  earlier  about  an  80 
percent  local  content,  and  the  response  was,  ‘‘Oh,  maybe  that 
should  be  60,  or  40,  or  whatever  make  sense,  as  long  as  it’s  meas-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

67 

urable.’’  Well,  1  percent’s  measurable.  I  mean,  what—how  much 
local coverage there is from broadcasting is going to be up to broad-
casters, not cable companies. 

In our market, we’re not a Comcast, we invest in a local channel 
that we carry only on our cable system, and it is the only local cov-
erage  for  the  markets  we  serve.  The  broadcasters  don’t  serve  that. 
We step up, as a cable operator, and do live 6 and 10 o’clock news 
to cover our market area, because local is very important. 

So, I think, as a cable operator, I am happy to embrace local, as 
long  as  it’s  really  local  and  not  just  a  facade  of  local  to  put  in  a 
shopping channel or some other filler. 

Senator SNOWE. Did you want to speak to that? 
Mr. SLENKER. Yes, Senator, if I may. Senator, DIRECTV believes 
so  much  in  the  importance  of  the  primary  local  television  signal, 
the  single  local  television  signal,  that  we  are,  without  government 
mandate,  spending  billions  of  dollars  to  build-out  the  ability  to  re-
transmit  1,500  local  high-definition  signals.  So,  I  would  like  to 
think we’re in the forefront of delivering those high-definition local 
digital  signals  to  the  American  public  without  any  kind  of  govern-
ment mandate. 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Well,  in  fact,  they  do  have  a  government  mandate: 
carry-one/carry-all.  If  they  carry  one  local,  they  have  to  carry  all. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Vitter is recognized for 5 minutes. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  wanted  to  build  on  Senator  Allen’s  comments  and  questions 
about  the  challenge  of  conversion.  And  I  guess  my  comments  and 
questions  are  really  focused  by  the  last  several  weeks,  in  my  part 
of the world, in Louisiana. 

We  had  a  tropical  storm.  We  barely  missed  a  hurricane.  Lou-
isiana is a relatively poor state. We have a much, much higher per-
centage  of  non-cable-hookup  sets.  And  so,  that  over-the-air  broad-
cast is an absolutely essential component for public safety, particu-
larly when we face regular threats on the Gulf from hurricanes. So, 
making sure that every set gets this capability to remain operating 
is  no  trivial  matter,  and  it’s  not  merely  a  matter  of  convenience. 
It absolutely goes to the core of public safety. 

I’m concerned about first responders, and homeland security, and 
all of that. That’s a legitimate concern essentially on the other side 
of the issue, pushing for quicker conversion. But, in my part of the 
world,  the  dominant  concern  is  the  one  I’m  talking  about  with  re-
gard to weather and hurricane threats. 

And so, I guess, to be very blunt, I hear this talk, ‘‘Well, it’s just 
a  matter  of  technology.  Clearly,  this  can  be  done.’’  I  think  it  is  a 
much,  much  bigger  project,  with  a  lot  more  room  for  pitfalls  than 
that  sort  of  throwaway  response  admits  to.  I  mean,  this  is  a  big 
project,  to  make  sure  that  TV  sets,  particularly  in  rural  areas  and 
where  poor  folks  live,  aren’t  just  shut  off.  And  I  guess  I’d  invite 
some  more  elaboration  on  how  we  really  get  that  done  and  don’t 
leave people, particularly poor folks and those in rural areas, in the 
lurch, not just for entertainment, but for essential public safety in-
formation.

Mr. LAWSON. Senator, we had an experience in the San Francisco 
Bay area last year. Our station, KCSM, the public station, the com-
munity-college  licensee,  had  a  tower  issue,  and  they  really  had  to 
make  a  choice  between  analog  broadcasting  and  digital  broad-
casting.  They  chose  digital,  and  they  did  everything  right.  They 
went  on  the  air  for  weeks  and  months.  They  did  publicity.  They 
tried  to  negotiate  carriage  with  cable  and  satellite,  with  some  suc-
cess. 

The  day  comes  that  they  turn  off  analog,  and  it  was  chaos.  The 
retailers  in  the  area  called  the  station  saying,  ‘‘Don’t  send  people 
to us. We don’t have converter boxes to sell them. We can get them 
on the Internet for $400 that will do high-definition TV.’’ But these 
are  people—elderly  people,  who  wanted  to  do  their  yoga  in  the 
morning.  The  station  ends  up  losing  38  percent  of  its  audience 
share. 

I agree. I share your concerns, and Senator Allen’s concerns. We 
can  make  a  hard  date,  but  you’re  talking  about  a  major  project. 
We’re  talking  about  a  Y2K-level  project,  to  convert  21  million  peo-
ple. 

As  I  said  to  the  listening  session,  that  was  a  successful  model. 
Let’s  look  at  the  conversion  of  the  metric  system  as  a  model  that 
didn’t work. So, it has to be carefully planned. 

And, in terms of public safety, I would like to reiterate that pub-
lic  broadcasters  working  with  our  commercial  colleagues  of  all  dif-
ferent media are making bandwidth available to the Department of 
Homeland Security for an upgrade to the Emergency Alert System. 
And  that  will  depend,  in  part,  upon  over-the-air,  but  there  are 
also—we’re looking to get that signal to all sorts of devices, like cell 
phones.  But  it  still  depends  on  a  robust  digital  over-the-air  broad-
cast signal. 

Mr.  ABUD.  If  I  may  add,  like  I  was  talking  about,  the—our  rela-
tionship  with  the  Hispanic  community,  our  consumer  really  needs 
us.  They  look  at  us  as  a  lifeline,  which  is  not  the  case  of  the  gen-
eral-market audience. Sometimes they call us, even before they call 
911, to report issues or problems. And in order for us to give them 
better  service,  just  to  give  you  an  example,  we  have  initiatives 
right  now  with  the  Los  Angeles  education  school  district.  We  are 
the  partners  to  provide  support  to  the  parents  in  how  they  help 
their kids going through school. Having the multicast will allow us 
to  expand  on  those  services,  but  I  need  to  have  the  must-carry  in 
order  for  those  services  to  reach  all  of  the  population  and  not  only 
those that get over-the-air. 

Mr.  FRITTS.  Senator,  I  used  to  operate  radio  stations  in  Lou-
isiana, so I’m familiar with the territory, and also concur that this 
is  a  herculean  problem.  But  if  the  Congress  says  2009  is  the  date, 
we  will  run  the  necessary  campaigns.  We’ll  help  develop  the  tech-
nology  to  make  sure  that  as  few  people  as  possible  are  displaced. 
Because  every  time  we  lose  a  television  set  to  technology,  if  you 
will, we’ve lost an opportunity. Our audience falls. 

And we agree with you that local television is so important, espe-
cially  when  you  have  so  many  hurricanes,  and  tornadoes,  and  bad 
weather  that  comes  through.  Not  just  that,  but  on  everyday  local 
information.  And  we  think  the  best  way  to  do  it  is  to  continue  the

must-carry regime that was laid out in 1992, following the govern-
mental interest, which was supported by the Supreme Court. 

Senator VITTER. Can I just interject? How does that continuation 
of must-carry really address the conversion issue I’m talking about? 
I  don’t  get  it.  I  mean,  I’m  talking  about  people  without  cable.  So, 
what does must-carry have to do with that? 

Mr.  FRITTS.  It  doesn’t  have  anything  to  do  with  people  without 

cable. 

Senator VITTER. OK. That’s what I’m talking about. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Gentlemen,  if  I  may,  we’re  going  to  have  a  fol-
low-on  hearing  at  2:30  today.  I  have  just  a  couple  of  questions,  if 
I might ask. I didn’t ask any at the beginning. 

Mr. Fritts, after you go digital, what’s the future of the over-the- 
air broadcasting for those people who don’t want to pay, who want 
their  own  set  free  to  the  consumer,  but  supported  by  advertisers? 
What’s the future of that system? 

Mr. FRITTS. We think it’s going to be robust, a robust system that 
will  continue  providing—it’s  going  to  be  in  a  very  competitive 
world, even more competitive in the future than it has been. Broad-
casters who specialize in localism, who provide more localism, rath-
er  than  less,  will  be  successful.  Those  who  scale  away  from  that 
and  try  to  provide  just  a  national  service  only,  in  my  view,  will 
have a more difficult time—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Congress has mandated that we’ll be digital after 

a certain date. 

Mr. FRITTS. That’s correct. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  But  we  will  have  set-top  boxes  that  will  reduce 
the  digital  to  analog  during  the  period  until  the  people  get  digital 
TV, right? 

Mr. FRITTS. That’s the current plan, yes, sir. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Now,  Mr.  McSlarrow,  what  do  we  do  about  the 
emergency  over  the—emergency  concepts  in  areas  that  are  just  to-
tally cable, and cable goes off the air? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Well,  I  mean,  we  have  to  rely  on  the  fact  that 

we have other ways to communicate. 

The CHAIRMAN. I want to know what that is. You know, it’s—you 
don’t  carry—you  don’t  have  the  ability  for  emergency  broadcasting 
back over-the-air again, do you? 

Mr. MCSLARROW. No, not currently. No, you’d have to rely on ei-

ther radio, or wireless, or some other form of communication. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  So,  in  the  things  that  Senator  Vitter  is  talking 
about—and, God knows, we all have our own earthquakes, and tor-
nadoes, and tidal waves—is over-the-air system still in the national 
interest  that  we  preserve  over-the-air,  and  preserve  it  in  a  digital 
basis, if possible? 

Mr. MCSLARROW. Absolutely. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  then,  why  do  you  suggest,  once  we  go 
through  the  process  of  converting  over-the-air  to  digital,  you  want 
to  downgrade  it  to  analog  until  your  customers  get  over  the—set- 
top  boxes?  You  don’t  want  us  to  provide  set-top  boxes  to  your  cus-
tomers. Why is that? 

Mr. MCSLARROW. I think it’s more you don’t want to, because it’ll 
cost $9 billion; whereas, we can down-convert at the headend, take 
care  of  this  at  our  own  cost,  give  people  exactly  the  same  service.

The  reason  we  need  to  down-convert  is,  we  have  40  million  house-
holds—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  But  if  those  customers  out  there  don’t  have  dig-

ital, they’re your guys’. 

Mr. MCSLARROW. Right. 
The CHAIRMAN. They have a set. They could pick up the over-the- 

air digital if they had a set-top box. 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Actually,  if  they  have  a  digital  TV,  they  could 

pick it up over-the-air, as well. 

We’re talking about your—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  But,  by  definition,  they  don’t  have  a  digital  TV. 

Mr. MCSLARROW. Our analog customers? Correct. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Your  analog  customers  are  sitting  out  there  in 
rural  Louisiana,  or  an  island  in  Hawaii  or  somewhere  in  Alaska, 
but  they’re  on  a  cable  system,  but  those  sets  will  pick  over-the-air 
broadcasting if they dial it in right, right? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  If  they  have  a  digital-to-analog  converter  box 

with it, yes. 

now. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes.  But  these  signals  are  going  to  be  digital 

Mr. MCSLARROW. Correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. But those sets are still analog. And you want us 
to maintain them in analog for a period of time, until you get ready 
to convert them. I don’t understand that. 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  No,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’m  sorry,  I  haven’t  been 
clear.  No,  we’re  all  for  the  transition  to  digital.  What  we’re  saying 
is,  when  it  comes  down  to  the  point  where  we  have  to  distribute 
a  signal  to  an  analog  customer,  we  need  to  be  able  to  give  them 
an  analog  signal.  Digital  signals  will  go  to  digital  customers.  So 
we’re not—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  But  your  signals  are  going  out  in  digital  to  your 

cable clients that have them, aren’t they? 
Mr. MCSLARROW. And we can do both. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  why  don’t  you  want  to  do  both—do  must- 

carry? 

question. 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  We  don’t  want  to  do  both  in  every  single  cir-
cumstance for every single operator for every single station. That’s 
when  you  get  into  real  capacity  crunches.  But  we  would  love  to  be 
able to carry as much as we can. And we will. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  promised  we’d  be  finished  by  noon.  One  last 

How  many  analog  customers  do  you  expect  to  have  on  your  sys-
tem  in  2009,  if  we  make  that  the  hard  date?  How  many  sets  will 
still  be  on  cable  systems  that  are  analog,  and  will  remain  analog 
until something changes? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  We  currently  have—I  think  our  estimate’s  134 
million  analog  TV  sets  in  cable  customer  households,  and  40  mil-
lion of those households are just analog, period. I don’t know what 
our  estimates  are  for  2009.  I  don’t  think  it  will  be  too  much  dif-
ferent.  We  have  26  million  digital  subscribers  now.  We’re  adding, 
you know, probably a million a year. But you’re still going to prob-
ably  have  roughly  50  percent  of  our  customers,  by  2009,  who  will 
still receive analog——

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  unless  we  do  something  about  it,  these  for-
eign  producers  of  our  TVs—and  I  don’t  know  of  any  that  are  pro-
duced  at  home—will  continue  bringing  into  the  United  States  sets 
that  look  like  they’re  digital,  but  they’re  not  digital-ready.  Unless 
we do something, all the televisions that come in from now on will 
still be analog until we mandate it, isn’t that right? 

Mr.  MCSLARROW.  Well,  you  can  buy—I  mean,  you  can  buy  them 

The CHAIRMAN. But they’re not all—— 
Mr. MCSLARROW. I think—— 
The CHAIRMAN.—they could bring in digital sets starting in Octo-

ber if we told them that’s all they could bring in. 

Mr. MCSLARROW. Well, they sell digital sets now, Mr. Chairman. 

today. 

And I think the key is notice, notice to consumers. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  How  much  longer  do  you  think  we  should  allow 

the sale of analog sets in the United States? 

Senator BURNS. To follow up on that, if the Senator would yield, 
what if we mandated a chip in every television—new television set 
to be sold today, that it could receive analog or digital already built 
into the set? What would happen? 

Mr. KNORR. I think—— 
The CHAIRMAN. The price would go up. 
Mr.  KNORR.  Yes,  I  think  that  would  be  a  question  for  the  elec-
tronics—but  I  assume  that  price  might  go  up,  but  I  think  that  the 
sooner the digital chips are in the TV sets, the sooner that acceler-
ates the transition. I mean, as a cable operator, I have no problem 
with  the  government  wanting  to  buy  converter  boxes  for  all  my 
analog customers. You know, I don’t have any objection to that. But 
I  think  we  can  make  that  not  necessary.  As  several  people  have 
outlined,  the  natural  transition  process,  from  the  time  the  signals 
are  available,  which  has  really  only  been  the  past  couple  of  years, 
is  a  10-,  to  15-,  to  even  20-year  process.  And  what  we’re  saying  is, 
as cable operators, we can facilitate that natural process by, at the 
same  time,  getting  spectrum  released  sooner,  without  forcing  cus-
tomers to accelerate that natural transition process. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all very much. 
We’re  going  to  convene  this  afternoon  at  2:30.  And  at  the  begin-
ning  of  that  meeting,  we  will  have  the  demonstration  of  the  im-
proved signal concept. 

Thank you. 
[Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the hearing was recessed.]

THE  DIGITAL  TELEVISION  TRANSITION— 

AFTERNOON  SESSION 

TUESDAY,  JULY  12,  2005 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:30  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  second  session  of  this  DTV  hearing  will 
focus on the use of analog spectrum by public-safety and high-tech 
groups.  It  will  also  consider  consumer  education  about  the  DTV 
transition. And, last, we’ll examine how a subsidy program for set- 
top boxes should be designed, and what it would cost. 

We have six witnesses. But before we start, I want to begin with 
a  demonstration  of  the  set-top  boxes,  which  Mike  Kennedy,  from 
Motorola, has agreed to demonstrate for us. 

Now,  Mike,  you  might  want  to  wait,  though,  for  some  of  the 

other, sort of—we call them, tardy, OK? 

[Laughter.] 
[Senators appear.] 
The CHAIRMAN. We do believe we’re going to have a full—not al-
most—an  almost  full  bench.  I’d  prefer  it  to  wait,  if  that’s  all  right 
with you. You’re going to be here for a while, anyway. Can we put 
that off? 

Mr. KENNEDY. That’s fine. Absolutely fine. 
The CHAIRMAN. And then, after it’s over, for the audience’s infor-
mation, Mr. Kennedy has agreed to turn this thing around and let 
you  all  see  the  same  thing.  We  couldn’t  set  it  up  on  both  sides  at 
the same time. 

So, why don’t we start, then, with the concept of the hearing? Let 
me  first  call  upon  Mike  Kennedy,  Senior  Vice  President  of  Motor-
ola.  What  we’re  going  to  do—do  you  all  have  any  opening  state-
ments here this afternoon? 

Well,  we’ll  just  go  across  the  panel,  as  we  did  this  morning,  and 
then  have  questions  from  each  Senator,  when  they  come  in.  But 
we’ll  pause,  when  we  get  a  sufficient  number,  to  have  Mr.  Ken-
nedy’s presentation of this. 

Mike?

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL D. KENNEDY, SENIOR VICE 

PRESIDENT, AMERICAS COUNTRY MANAGEMENT; 

DIRECTOR, GLOBAL GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, MOTOROLA 
Mr. KENNEDY. Good afternoon, Chairman Stevens, and members 

of the Committee. 

My  name’s  Mike  Kennedy,  and  I  have  responsibility  for  Country 
Management for North and South America, as well as Government 
Relations,  for  Motorola,  worldwide.  It’s  an  honor  to  be  here  with 
you today. 

As you know, Motorola is the original high-tech startup company, 
with  over  75  years  of  technology  heritage.  We  developed  the  first 
cell  phone,  and  have  a  65-year  history  of  providing  ever-advancing 
communications  systems  for  public  safety.  Today,  Motorola  is  a 
leading  provider  of  solutions  for  cellular,  wired,  and  wireless 
broadband, first responders, and cable communications. 

I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for scheduling this hearing, 
and I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to dis-
cuss  the  promise  of  completing  the  DTV  transition  for  America’s 
consumers and first responders. 

Before I discuss the importance of the spectrum for public safety, 
I  would  like  to  talk  briefly  about  the  benefits  that  will  arise  from 
portions  of  the  700  megahertz  spectrum  that  are  to  be  used  for 
commercial services. The characteristics of this spectrum provide a 
unique opportunity for the development of new wireless broadband 
service  providers,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  The  favorable  propa-
gation  characteristics  of  the  700  megahertz  band  means  that 
broadband  services  could  be  initially  deployed  with  only  one-quar-
ter of the infrastructure that would be necessary in other spectrum 
allocations commonly used for WiFi-type services. 

Affordable  wireless  broadband  will  provide  enormous  benefits  to 
the American public, including providing access to information and 
services  such  as  telemedicine,  so  that  doctors  can  remotely  treat 
patients,  assist  in  delicate  medical  procedures,  and  transmit  large 
medical files; telework, allowing work from home or other locations, 
thereby  reducing  travel  time,  increasing  efficiency,  and  providing 
people  in  remote  areas  greater  opportunities  for  employment;  and 
distance  learning,  providing  greater  opportunities  for  America’s 
youth to get a quality education. These are just a few of the exam-
ples of the almost limitless applications and opportunities provided 
by affordable broadband. 

In  addition,  we  can  improve  the  quality  of  mission-critical  infor-
mation  to  our  front-line  responders.  For  example,  an  officer  or  an 
agent could transmit video of a potential biological weapon and get 
real-time counsel from a remote expert. Police could instantly send 
or receive a photograph of an abducted child. Firefighters could ac-
cess building blueprints, hydrant locations, and hazardous-material 
data.  Unfortunately,  these  benefits  for  our  safety  and  security 
await Congressional action on DTV. 

As  you  explore  ways  to  complete  the  DTV  transition,  we  encour-
age  you  to  continue  your  examination  of  the  provision  of  converter 
boxes to analog TV consumers who do not subscribe to cable or sat-
ellite TV services. To make the transition a success, consumer edu-
cation, the converter box, and a hard date will combine for a pain- 
free end to antique analog TV services.

Motorola estimates the price to a consumer for a digital-to-analog 
converter  box  that  would  facilitate  the  transition  on  January  1, 
2009,  to  be  $50.  Anybody—this  is  an  example—in  fact,  this  is  a 
working  converter  box  here  that  I  will  demonstrate  at  your  pleas-
ure a little later—anybody can make this box. It’s a one-time mar-
ketplace.  And  we  would  encourage  you  to  examine  it.  As  you  look 
to  craft  policy  to  provide  converters  for  Americans  who  watch  TV 
over-the-air  with  analog  sets,  we  think  the  affordable  price  of  this 
box can really help. 

Mr. Chairman, at that point, what I would like to do is hold the 
rest  of  my  remarks.  And  I’ll  be  happy  to  offer  the  demonstration 
when you want me to. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Kennedy follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL D. KENNEDY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAS 

COUNTRY MANAGER; DIRECTOR, GLOBAL GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, MOTOROLA 

Good  morning,  Chairman  Stevens,  Co-Chairman  Inouye,  and  members  of  the 

Committee. 

My name is Mike Kennedy, and I am the Americas Country Manager for Motorola 
and  head  of  Global  Government  Relations  for  the  company.  We  have  served  state, 
and local public safety and Federal law enforcement and their technology needs for 
more than 65 years. We also created the walkie-talkie for the warriors of WWII, the 
pager,  the  satellite  phone,  the  cell  phone,  and  now  we  are  working  to  obsolete  the 
cell  phone  with  mobile  devices  that  will  be  more  like  universal  remote  controls  for 
life. 

I want to express my appreciation to you, Mr. Chairman, for scheduling this hear-
ing  to  address  the  need  to  provide  timely  and  specific  access  to  much-needed  spec-
trum  in  the  700  MHz  band  to  America’s  first  responders  and  for  other  wireless 
broadband  purposes.  You  and  Senator  Inouye  have  been  great  champions  for  the 
public  safety  community  and  the  need  to  end  the  digital  television  transition  with 
a fixed date. 

As  you  know,  the  report  of  the  National  Commission  on  Terrorist  Attacks  Upon 
the United States (hereinafter the ‘‘Report’’) highlighted the critical need of the pub-
lic  safety  community  to  have  access  to  additional  spectrum  for  its  mission-critical 
communications needs. 

It  is  an  honor  to  be  here  with  you  today  to  discuss  how  we  can  implement  one 
of  the  recommendations  of  the  Report  that  remains  un-legislated,  and  provide  for 
a safer America by ensuring that first responders have the resources needed for life- 
saving  communications.  The  horrible  events  last  week  in  London  further  amplify 
the  need  to  provide  our  emergency  responders  with  the  tools  necessary  to  respond 
as quickly and effectively as possible. 

Ending  the  digital  television  transition,  as  you  know,  also  frees  up  spectrum  for 
advanced  commercial  services.  These  services  will  enable  greater  connectivity  for 
rural  areas,  greater  competition  in  the  provision  of  broadband,  and  new  mobile  ap-
plications  to  link  people  with  technology’s  promise  no  matter  where  they  may  be: 
in  the  home,  at  work,  in  the  car,  or  out  and  about  going  about  living  their  lives. 
Motorola’s Technology Heritage 

Motorola  is  a  leading  provider  of  communications  and  information  solutions,  in-
cluding  public  safety,  private,  commercial  wireless,  cable,  and  wireline  communica-
tions.  We  have  more  than  six  decades  of  experience  in  meeting  the  mission-critical 
needs of our public safety customers. We offer an extensive portfolio of solutions spe-
cifically  designed  to  meet  the  rapidly  evolving  safety  and  security  needs  of  these 
customers.  Our  solutions  include  interoperable  mission-critical  radio  systems  based 
on  the  P25  public  safety  interoperability  standard;  command  and  control  solutions; 
identification  and  tracking  solutions;  information  management  for  criminal  justice 
and civil needs; and physical security and monitoring solutions. 

In 2002, our public safety business in Motorola received the Malcolm Baldrige Na-
tional  Quality  Award,  the  Nation’s  premier  award  for  performance  excellence  and 
quality  achievement.  We  continually  strive  to  translate  the  quality  processes  upon 
which this award was based into high quality and reliable communications systems 
for  our  public  safety  customers.  Motorola  works  very  closely  with  our  customers  to 
help  them  implement  communications  capabilities  needed  for  both  every  day  mis-
sion critical needs and catastrophic events.

Motorola  invented  the  cell  phone  in  1973.  Today  we  are  leader  in  multi-mode, 
multi-band communications products and technologies and are transforming the de-
vice  formerly  known  as  the  cell  phone  into  a  universal  remote  control  for  life.  We 
are advancing seamless mobility with innovative technology solutions and delivering 
proven capabilities in cellular, wireless broadband and wireline access technologies, 
with  recognized  leadership  in  integrating  core  networks  through  wireless  IP,  wire-
less softswitch and IP multimedia subsystems. As the largest cable set-top box pro-
vider,  we  are  providing  scalable,  integrated  end-to-end  systems  for  the  delivery  of 
broadband services that keep consumers informed, entertained, and connected. 

As a company, Motorola has also been a leader in developing and providing tech-
nology  for  the  broadcast  and  cable  industries.  In  1947,  we  built  one  of  the  first  af-
fordable TV sets, which was offered to consumers for under $200. In 1957, the com-
pany built the technology for the first pay-per-view cable event. In 1963, as TV up-
graded from black and white to color, Motorola developed the first truly rectangular 
picture tube for color television in a joint venture with the National Video Corpora-
tion. The tube quickly became the standard for the industry. In 1972, we developed 
the first remote-controlled set-top box, and in 1992, Motorola helped launch the dig-
ital  revolution  by  proposing  to  the  government  a  concept  that  no  one  else  had  seri-
ously  considered—transitioning  from  analog  to  digital  technology  to  drive  the  mar-
ket to high-definition TV (HDTV) and facilitate the recovery of spectrum. 
Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report 

The Report by the 9/11 Commission extensively reviewed how emergency respond-
ers  communicated  or,  in  too  many  cases,  were  unable  to  communicate,  during  the 
tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001.  The  Report  notes  that  there  was  substantial 
inability to communicate on the needed level of interoperability at the World Trade 
Center, the Pentagon, and in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 

While  it  is  clear  that  prior  coordination,  advanced  preparation,  and  training  by 
responding  agencies  greatly  enhanced  communications  among  emergency  personnel 
when  it  was  done,  all  too  often  this  prior  planning,  coordination,  and  training  did 
not  occur,  and  the  ability  of  multiple  agencies  to  work  together  to  maximize  their 
life-saving efforts was frustrated. 

Planning  and  coordination  can  only  go  so  far,  however,  to  provide  effective  com-
munications  in  an  emergency.  Absent  proper  equipment  and  resources  communica-
tions  capabilities  can  quickly  become  overwhelmed,  greatly  diminishing  their  effec-
tiveness.  Proper  resources  not  only  include  radios  that  can  interoperate  among 
agencies  using  a  common  standard,  but  also  spectrum  to  ensure  the  availability  of 
sufficient  system  capacity.  The  9/11  Commission  recognized  this  fact  and  rec-
ommended that Congress legislate the expedited and increased assignment of radio 
spectrum for public safety. 

Motorola,  the  Nation’s  major  law  enforcement  and  fire  fighting  organizations,  as 
well  as  the  associations  representing  America’s  cities,  counties,  and  mayors  fully 
support  this  recommendation.  The  spectrum  referred  to  in  the  report  is  in  the  700 
MHz band. Public safety identified the need for this spectrum 8 years ago in a Sep-
tember 11, 1996 report by the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee. That re-
port,  rather  eerily,  indicated  that  the  24  MHz  under  consideration  today  should  be 
available within 5 years. As we all know, 5 years later the horrific terrorist attacks 
on  our  soil  gave  rise  to  the  9/11  Commission,  which  again,  urged  that  these  fre-
quencies  be  made  available  to  public  safety.  In  the  absence  of  these  frequencies 
being  available  to  public  safety  for  their  critical  communications  needs,  the  Nation 
unfortunately  is  needlessly  less  equipped  than  it  should  be—in  an  area  we  know 
how  to  fix—to  protect  the  American  people.  After  the  first  report  was  published, 
Congress  acted  quickly,  to  allocate  this  spectrum  to  public  safety  in  1997.  Unfortu-
nately, since then, public safety’s ability to use this spectrum has been greatly ham-
pered  or  stopped  in  the  areas  where  it  is  most  needed—the  major  urban  centers. 
The reason is the continued use of the spectrum for analog broadcast television serv-
ices absent a date-certain as to when the spectrum will be fully transferred to public 
safety’s  use.  The  communication  needs  of  public  safety  are  too  important  to  allow 
this uncertainty to continue. 

Swift action by this Congress can provide public safety access to one of the funda-
mental building blocks of an effective communications system—spectrum. Congress’ 
commitment  made  in  the  Intel  Reform  bill,  passed  in  December,  to  pass  legislation 
this  year  to  end  the  DTV  transition  was  excellent,  and  we  urge  you  not  to  be  de-
terred. 

Current  law  sets  December  31,  2006,  as  the  date  for  clearing  television  from  the 
band.  However,  this  is  not  a  firm  date.  Broadcasters  do  not  have  to  clear  the  band 
until  85  percent  of  the  households  in  their  service  areas  have  the  capability  to  re-

Under  current  law,  while  TV  incumbents  are  required  to  vacate  this  spectrum  at 
the  end  of  2006,  they  can  receive  an  unlimited  extension  of  this  deadline  based  on 
the state of the transition in their particular market. So, in reality, there is no ‘‘hard 
date’’ when the transition will end and the spectrum will really be accessible to pub-
lic safety and wireless broadband service providers everywhere. This is not the opti-
mal  situation  for  the  public  safety  or  high  tech  communities  and  those  they  serve. 
We  commend  and  encourage  efforts  by  this  Committee  to  act  on  the  recommenda-
tion  of  the  9/11  Commission  that  legislation  be  enacted  that  would  clear  this  spec-
trum nationwide for public safety as close to year-end 2006 as possible. We also ap-
plaud  Senators  McCain  and  Lieberman  for  their  dedicated  efforts  to  help  advance 
this need with their SAVE LIVES Act. We eagerly look forward to the direction that 
you,  Mr.  Chairman,  will  take  and  offer  our  support,  in  advance,  to  you  on  this  vi-
tally important initiative. 
Converters  Can  Enable  a  Date-Certain  for  the  Transition,  Increase 
Channels,  and  Provide  a  Clearer  Picture  for  Consumers  With  Analog 
TVs 

While clearing the 700 MHz spectrum for public safety will affect a small number 
of viewers relative to the improved security gains for many, Motorola believes there 
are  options  for  mitigating  the  over-the-air  impact  while  affording  the  invaluable 
benefits of completing the full transition to digital television. Completing the transi-
tion  to  digital  television  will  have  numerous  benefits,  including  spectrum  for  ad-
vanced  public  safety  and  consumer  services,  enhanced  and  expanded  viewing  op-
tions for the public, more efficient use of the spectrum, and the likelihood that dig-
ital stations will provide a wide variety of data and other services to the public. 

The Congress could realize the gains of the transition as early as possible by set-
ting  a  hard  date  for  the  transition,  and  ensuring  that  viewers  continue  to  have  ac-
cess  to  free  over-the-air  television  by  providing  inexpensive  digital-to-analog  over- 
the-air  converter  boxes  to  those  that  need  them.  A  similar  approach  was  used  in 
Berlin, Germany, to ensure a seamless and pain-free crisp analog-to-digital TV tran-
sition.  This  was  achieved  through  the  provision  of  converter  boxes  to  some  TV  con-
sumers  who  did  not  subscribe  to  cable  or  satellite  TV  service  and  maintained  an 
analog TV set. We believe this is a positive step that could provide a real path for-
ward  on  how  to  solve  the  transition  here  in  the  U.S.  The  Berlin  Model  worked.  To 
make it a success, consumer education, a converter box subsidy, and a hard transi-
tion  date  combined  for  a  real  win.  This  type  of  approach  can  allow  this  Congress 
to reach a solution that addresses the needs of all stakeholders. The status quo can-
not be allowed to stand. A simple technology solution that you can enable will guide 
the public and industry through the transition, and fulfill the Committee’s years old 
vision of making available the advanced services in the 700 MHz band that will ben-
efit the American people. 

Motorola  is  a  TV  set-top  box  provider.  In  comments  to  the  FCC  almost  one  year 
ago, we stated that—assuming that the market is driven by a hard deadline of De-
cember  31,  2006,  for  the  end  of  the  DTV  transition—we  estimated  that  the  cost  of 
a  digital-to-analog  over-the-air  converter  box  would  be  approximately  $67  per  unit. 
That estimate was based on the best possible foreseeable technology and implemen-
tation  information  available  at  that  time.  Today,  we  are  pleased  to  be  able  to  say 
that  our  estimate  was  a  conservative  one.  Suppliers  are  making  changes  that  pro-
vide  better  integration  of  the  converter  components,  and  prices  are  moving  down. 
We would now expect that a $67 dollar price would be achievable earlier than origi-
nally expected, and believe that this downward trend will continue. We expect that 
by  January  1,  2009,  converters  would  be  available  for  approximately  $50  assuming 
that a hard deadline for the end of the digital transition is set. 

The implications of this $50 figure are profound. Such a price per unit would peg 
the  cost  of  providing  one  digital-to-analog  converter  box  for  every  exclusively  over- 
the-air  household,  based  on  studies  by  the  Consumer  Electronics  Association,1 at 
around  $660  million.  Asking  consumers  to  contribute  $20  toward  the  box  would  re-
duce  the  government  cost  to  around  $400  million,  and  also  help  minimize  fraud. 
While  the  population  will  grow,  these  over-the-air  TV  numbers  will  continue  to  de-
cline  dramatically  by  January  1,  2009.  As  CEA  testifies  today,  in  2005,  approxi-
mately 12 percent of the Nation’s households rely on over-the-air TV, and at the end 
of 2008, they project the number to drop to 6.8 percent, or about 60 percent of what 
it  is  today.  Applying  this  trend  to  the  above  figures,  a  $50  converter  box  provided 
to  every  exclusively  over-the-air  household  would  cost  the  government  approximately

tribution.

The cost to provide converters to those who need them is much less than the an-
ticipated  spectrum  auction  proceeds  for  the  commercial  digital  wireless  broadband 
licenses that would occupy the reclaimed analog TV spectrum. 

Upon  conclusion  of  the  transition,  viewers  who  receive  their  television  program-
ming through cable or satellite will not have to make any changes to continue using 
their existing analog television sets. The relatively small percentage of viewers who 
receive  their  television  programming  directly  from  over-the-air  broadcasts  will  be 
able to continue using their existing television sets, although a digital-to-analog con-
verter will be needed to do so. 

The  converter  receives  the  digital  signal  and  converts  it  to  an  analog  signal  that 
analog  TVs  recognize.  They  are  easy  to  install  and  use.  The  converter  is  connected 
between the antenna and television using standard cables and connections. The con-
nections are compatible with even the oldest television sets. 

There are a number of advantages to receiving digital signals even while viewing 
an analog television. Digital TV signals are less prone to interference and generally 
provide a clearer picture than analog signals. The converted digital signals are free 
from  the  ‘‘ghosts’’  and  ‘‘snow’’  experienced  with  off-air  analog  signals.  This  provides 
an  improved  viewing  experience  and  a  significantly  better  picture  over  fair  quality 
analog  transmissions.  Going  digital  also  gives  broadcasters  the  opportunity  to  pro-
vide  over-the-air  viewers  with  more  channels  and  viewing  options.  With  digital, 
broadcasters can send multiple channels of programming in the same space that one 
analog  channel  occupies.  The  digital-to-analog  converter  recognizes  all  of  these 
channels  and  displays  them  independently  on  existing  analog  televisions.  Many 
broadcasters  are  already  taking  advantage  of  this  opportunity  to  provide  viewers 
with more programming and information by providing multiple channels of over-the- 
air  content,  including  additional  programming  or  local  news  and  weather  informa-
tion. 

Setting  a  firm  transition  date  is  critical  to  resolve  the  current  chicken  and  egg 
conundrum of the DTV transition. As you know, doing so will not only provide criti-
cally needed spectrum for public safety, but will also unlock new entertainment and 
information  services  for  consumers,  and  will  provide  additional  opportunities  for 
American  industry.  Wireless  communications  provide  our  first  responders  with  the 
right information, at the right time and in the right place, whether that information 
is voice, data, or video. 
Public Safety Needs 700 MHz Spectrum for Critical Technologies 

Motorola’s  partnership  with  the  public  safety  community  over  the  years  has 
taught  us  that  first  responders  need  systems  designed  specifically  for  mission  crit-
ical operations to get the job done. For example, as with most of the Northeast and 
Midwest, the State of Michigan was confronted with a large-scale emergency during 
the  August  2003  blackout.  Despite  the  failures  experienced  by  various  commercial 
carrier  networks  in  Michigan,  and  surrounding  states,  due  to  these  power  outages, 
Michigan’s  nearly  12,000  public  safety  radios  experienced  no  interruptions  in  com-
munications.  Police  officers,  firefighters,  and  EMS  providers  worked  as  a  team  in 
real-time to serve the public. Michigan had control over its communications because 
it  had  created  a  statewide  mission  critical  network  designed  specifically  for  cata-
strophic  situations  and  events,  including  the  disruption  of  normal  power  sources. 
While  many  public  safety  entities  also  use  public  carrier  networks  for  less  critical 
communications, there is no substitute for mission critical systems when the safety 
of first responders, and the public they serve is at risk. 

Effective  mission  critical  mobile  and  portable  communications  systems  are  abso-
lutely  essential  to  public  safety  operations.  Police  officers,  firefighters,  emergency 
medical  personnel,  and  their  departments  use  mobile  and  portable  communications 
to exchange information that can help protect public safety officials and the citizens 
they  serve.  Traditionally,  this  information  was  mostly  exchanged  by  voice.  Increas-
ingly,  as  public  safety  entities  strive  to  increase  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  to-
day’s world, they also need the capability to reliably transmit and receive high per-
formance data, still images, and video. Spectrum is the road upon which such com-
munications travel, and increased communications requirements lead to the need for 
more spectrum. 

Based on a thorough justification of need, Congress and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission dedicated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band to state and 
local public safety in 1997. The FCC established specific nationwide interoperability 
channels  within  this  spectrum  allocation,  as  well  as  both  narrowband  and 
broadband  channels  to  support  a  variety  of  identified  public  safety  communications 
requirements.

However,  8  years  later,  incumbent  television  stations  operating  on  channels  62, 
63,  64,  65,  67,  68,  and  69  prevent  public  safety  access  to  this  essential  resource  in 
most  major  urban  areas  where  the  demand  for  more  spectrum  is  the  greatest.  The 
recent focus on increased interoperability and Homeland Security make availability 
of this public safety spectrum nationwide even more critical. 
These channels are critical to public safety for two reasons: 

(1)  Together,  the  new  700  MHz  and  current  800  MHz  bands  provide  the  best 
opportunity  to  integrate  interoperable  communications.  The  700  MHz  band’s 
proximity  to  the  800  MHz  band  allows  public  safety  agencies  to  expand  their 
current  800  MHz  narrowband  voice  and  data  systems  for  interoperability  and 
regional  coordination  on  an  ‘‘intra’’  as  well  as  ‘‘inter’’  agency  basis.  Equipment 
operating  in  these  combined  frequency  bands  on  the  FCC-endorsed  Project  25 
interoperability standard is commercially available today. The FCC has granted 
each  state  a  license  to  operate  such  narrowband  communications  in  the  700 
MHz  band.  Localities  throughout  the  country  are  actively  engaged  in  spectrum 
planning  at  700  MHz,  a  prerequisite  for  obtaining  their  own  FCC  licenses.  For 
example, after a year-long review by the FCC, the Southern California regional 
plan  was  approved,  but  TV  incumbency  prevents  actual  use  of  the  spectrum  in 
much of that area. 
(2)  700  MHz  is  the  only  dedicated  spectrum  allocation  where  public  safety  can 
implement  advanced  mobile  wide  area  systems  that  bring  high-speed  access  to 
databases,  the  intranet,  imaging,  and  video  to  first  responders  out  in  the  field. 
This  technology  offers  a  whole  new  level  of  mobile  communications  capabilities, 

which is far beyond today’s voice and low-speed data applications. For example: 

a.  An  officer  or  agent  could  transmit  video  of  a  potential  bomb,  or  biological 
weapon and get real-time counsel from an expert in another location. 
b.  Local  or  State  police  could  instantly  send  or  receive  a  photograph  of  a  miss-
ing or abducted child. 
c.  Crime  scene  investigators  can  transmit  live  video  of  footprints,  fingerprints, 
and evidence to speed analysis and apprehension of perpetrators. 
d.  Firefighters  can  access  building  blueprints,  hydrant  locations  hazardous  ma-
terial data, and other critical information. 
e.  Paramedics  can  transmit  live  video  of  the  patient  to  doctors  at  the  hospital 
that would help save lives. 

Motorola previously conducted wideband trials together with public safety entities 
in  Pinellas  County,  Florida  and  the  City  of  Chicago.  We  are  also  proud  to  be  part 
of  the  broadband  demonstration  that  is  being  led  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Tech-
nology  Officer  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Government  (OCTO).  That  system  pro-
vides  coverage  throughout  most  of  the  District,  and  is  providing  valuable  informa-
tion  to  law  enforcement  agents.  We  are  proud  to  be  working  with  the  OCTO  on  an 
innovative  solution  that  will  deliver  powerful  applications  to  the  front-line  first  re-
sponders here in our Nation’s Capitol. All of these trials operate under experimental 
700  MHz  licenses  from  the  FCC.  The  capabilities  demonstrated  are  the  emerging 
powerful multi-media applications that will bring public safety communications into 
the Twenty-First Century. 

As you know, the 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band is allocated for state 
and local public safety use. Congress, in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Pre-
vention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–458), signed into law in December, directed the 
Federal Communications Commission, along with the Department of Homeland De-
fense and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, to con-
duct an assessment of public safety spectrum needs to determine whether this allo-
cation  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  communications  needs  of  public  safety.  This  effort 
is ongoing, and is especially important as we see the demand for information, exem-
plified  by  trials  like  the  one  here  in  the  District,  grow  for  access  to  full  broadband 
services for public safety. 

In addition, while this allocation will be available for state and local law enforce-
ment,  no  comparable  spectrum  allocation  exists  for  meeting  the  Homeland  Security 
requirements  of  Federal  agencies  or  critical  infrastructure  entities.  Such  interoper-
ability  among  state  and  local  first  responders,  Federal  agencies  and  critical  infra-
structure entities will best be achieved through the availability of comparable spec-
trum resources. These issues must be carefully considered in order to provide a com-
prehensive and long-term solution that meets America’s security needs. 

Once cleared, the original 24 MHz of spectrum allocated to Public Safety in 1997, 
will support narrowband and wideband applications for State and Local government 
agencies. Narrowband 12.5 kHz channels provide the capacity for voice and text-like

80 

data. This will help promote interoperability as public safety entities necessarily ex-
pand their capabilities. Notably, narrowband radios which support both 700 and 800 
MHz  in  one  radio  are  already  available.  As  users  purchase  additional  radios  for 
their 800 MHz systems, they will have the capability to use the 700 MHz band once 
it  is  cleared.  Wideband  spectrum  at  700  MHz  supports  applications  such  as  image- 
rich records access and higher speed video streaming over wide areas. 

The  Public  Safety  community,  the  FCC  and  multiple  equipment  manufacturers 
have  already  spent  considerable  time  and  resources  to  develop  the  operational  and 
technical  rules  for  that  24  MHz  of  spectrum.  In  addition,  both  narrowband  and 
wideband interoperability standards have been developed and are supported by mul-
tiple  competitive  manufacturers.  For  example,  the  TIA902  SAM  standard  for  wide-
band  public  safety  operations  at  700  MHz  has  been  developed  and  unanimously 
adopted  by  the  public  safety  community  and  multiple  competitive  manufacturers. 
Subsequently,  the  TIA  902  wideband  standard  was  endorsed  by  the  Public  Safety 
community and specifically recommended for FCC adoption. 
700 MHz Spectrum Holds the Promise of Economic Benefits and Growth 

In  addition  to  the  24  MHz  of  spectrum  allocated  to  public  safety  in  the  700  MHz 
band,  there  is  84  MHz  of  spectrum  allocated  for  commercial  uses.  Of  this,  24  MHz 
has  already  been  licensed,  although  use  is  severely  limited  due  to  continued  use  of 
the  spectrum  by  TV  broadcasters.  Of  the  108  megahertz  to  be  reclaimed,  60  mega-
hertz remain to be licensed. This spectrum holds tremendous promise as a home for 
another  generation  of  advanced  wireless  broadband  services  that  that  will  provide 
American  citizens  with  greater  access  to  information,  and  provide  immense  eco-
nomic benefits from greater productivity. 

The  societal  benefits  of  providing  access  to  broadband  services  can  not  be  ques-

tioned. Broadband access enables powerful applications. For example: 

• Telemedicine  so  that  doctors  can  remotely  treat  patients  that  are  too  frail  or 
injured  to  travel  to  an  expert  medical  facility,  to  remotely  assist  in  a  delicate 
medical  procedure,  or  to  transmit  large  medical  files  or  information  for  evalua-
tion at an expert specialized facility. 

• Telework,  which  allows  workers  to  work  from  home  or  other  locations  outside 
of  the  regular  company  office.  This  reduces  travel  time  to  work,  can  increase 
efficiency  and  provide  people  in  remote  areas  greater  opportunities  for  employ-
ment. 

• Digital  government  so  that  leaders  can  provide  citizens  greater  access  to  gov-

ernment services through e-government initiatives. 

• Advanced farming to improve and increase the efficiency of monitoring and con-
trolling of agricultural resources, increasing crop and livestock yields by alerting 
farmers to problem areas, and providing farmers access to the information nec-
essary to take corrective action. These technologies can reduce the costs associ-
ated with distribution of farm products, and can increase the safety of food sup-
ply by enabling better tracking of products through the production and distribu-
tion network. 
• Distance  learning  so  that  all  Americans  have  access  to  the  best  possible  edu-
• Increased  access  to  services  and  opportunities  for  persons  with  disabilities  will 

cation on an equal footing. 

strengthen their participation in the information economy. 

These are just a few examples of the almost limitless applications and opportuni-

ties provided by broadband. 

While  the  benefits  of  broadband  are  clear,  America’s  commitment  to  widespread 
cost-effective  deployment  of  broadband  is  not.  The  United  States  has  steadily 
slipped  down  the  broadband  deployment  slope  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  world, 
and  now  ranks  16th  in  broadband  subscribers  as  a  percentage  of  the  population. 
The  spectrum  that  will  be  made  available  at  700  MHz  as  a  result  of  the  transition 
to  digital  television  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  provide  facilities-based  com-
petitive  broadband  services.  The  favorable  propagation  characteristics  of  the  700 
MHz band will allow broadband services to be initially deployed with approximately 
25 percent of the infrastructure that would be necessary in the 2.4 GHz band, which 
is  commonly  used  for  WiFi  today,  considerably  reducing  the  costs  of  deployment. 
These  propagation  characteristics  also  allow  for  easier  penetration  through  and 
around potential obstacles to deploying wireless services in higher frequency bands. 
The characteristics of this spectrum make it ideal for both mobile and fixed services. 
Exclusive  licenses  for  use  of  these  frequencies  will  allow  operators  to  provide  the 
highest quality service in terms of reliability, and will provide incentives for efficient

81 

use.  Such  an  opportunity  could  significantly  advance  efforts  to  provide  broadband 
services to all Americans. 

The  economic  benefits  of  this  spectrum  are  enormous.  Estimates  of  the  auction 
revenues  from  this  spectrum  range  from  $10  billion  toward  $30  billion.  This  pales 
in comparison, however, to the economic benefits to society. When considering such 
implications  as  increased  productivity  for  the  Nation,  and  lower  costs  of  services  to 
consumers  due  to  making  this  spectrum  available  for  better  uses  than  merely  ana-
log  TV,  the  economic  benefit  to  America  was  recently  estimated  at  $233  billion  to 
$473 billion dollars in a report by the Analysis Group.2 

Significant  steps  have  already  been  taken  that  will  provide  for  rapid  commercial 
use  of  this  spectrum  when  it  is  fully  available.  Standards  bodies,  including  the  3rd 
Generation  Global  Partnerships  and  the  Telecommunications  Industry  Association 
have  already  adopted  standards  for  use  of  technology  in  this  spectrum.3 Standard-
ized  technology  will  lower  the  cost  of  equipment  and  provide  for  rapid  acceptance 
of  equipment  and  services.  In  addition,  companies  that  have  licenses  in  this  spec-
trum  band  have  begun  to  deploy  systems  in  the  limited  areas  not  encumbered  by 
broadcast  stations.  For  example,  Qualcomm  has  developed  its  MediaFLOTM system 
to  provide  voice  and  data  multimedia  to  mobile  devices.  Such  innovative  tech-
nologies hold the promise of providing consumers with access to exciting new levels 
of information and entertainment. 

In closing, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, we urge you not to be 
deterred  from  sticking  as  close  as  possible  to  the  original  December  31,  2006  goal. 
Making  this  spectrum  available  for  new  innovative  technologies  to  support  first  re-
sponders and consumers nationwide anytime near the end of 2006, will not happen 
without  you.  The  Report  of  the  9/11  Commission  has  reaffirmed  the  need  for  this 
spectrum  and  added  new  impetus  to  making  it  available  to  our  Nation’s  First  Re-
sponders.  We  urge  you  to  take  swift  action  this  year  to  make  this  important  long- 
awaited objective a reality for law enforcement, fire fighters, emergency medics, and 
your constituents. As we have just seen, our allies in London were attacked by ter-
rorists.  All  of  the  experts  tell  us  that  it  is  not  a  matter  of  if,  but  when,  will  they 
strike us here again. Communications tools are vital in these emergencies. We know 
this and we know how to make them available—it starts with ending the DTV tran-
sition. 

Motorola stands ready to support this Committee to help minimize the impact on 
the viewing public of making 700 MHz spectrum available, and to put this spectrum 
to  its  highest  and  best  use—protecting  American  citizens.  We  respectfully  urge  the 
Congress  to  take  action  to  implement  the  recommendation  of  the  9/11  Commission 
to  make  the  700  MHz  spectrum  fully  available  to  public  safety  by  a  date  certain 
as soon as possible. 

Thank you.

Washington,  D.C.  I  serve  as  the  Chairman  of  the  Communications 
and  Technology  Committee  of  the  International  Association  of 
Chiefs  of  Police,  a  position  I’ve  held  for  more  than  27  years.  I  also 
serve as the Communications Advisor for the Major City Chiefs As-
sociation,  the  National  Sheriffs  Association,  and  the  Major  County 
Sheriffs Association. 

In addition to these organizations, today I’m also speaking on be-
half  of  the  Association  of  Public  Safety  Communications  Officials 
International,  better  known  as  APCO,  the  Police  Executive  Re-
search  Forum,  the  International  Association  of  Fire  Chiefs,  the 
Congressional Fire Services Institute, National Association of State 
EMS  Directors,  the  National  Association  of  Counties,  and  the  Na-
tional League of Cities. 

Citizens  rely  upon  their  local  and  state  police  agencies,  sheriffs 
offices,  fire  departments,  emergency  medical  services,  and  other 
public-safety  agencies  to  come  to  their  assistance  wherever  and 
whenever needed, whether it is a crime in progress, a civil disturb-
ance, a building fire, a forest fire, an automobile accident, a health 
emergency, a natural disaster, or, as we learned on 9/11, a terrorist 
attack. Citizens assume that those first responders will get the call, 
and will have the communications tools they need to address emer-
gencies quickly and efficiently. 

Radio  spectrum  is  critical  for  public-safety  agencies  to  maintain 
the  communications  capability  they  need  to  protect  the  safety  of 
life and property. However, in 1996, a blue-ribbon committee deter-
mined  that  public-safety  agencies  did  not  have  sufficient  radio 
spectrum to do their jobs. 

Congress  responded  in  1997,  by  directing  the  FCC  to  reallocate 
24  megahertz  of  spectrum  in  the  700  megahertz  band  for  public- 
safety services. Unfortunately, the 700 megahertz band public-safe-
ty spectrum continues to be blocked by television stations on Chan-
nels 63, 64, 68, and 69, and, to some degree, on adjacent Channels 
62,  65,  and  67,  especially  in  the  major  metropolitan  areas.  Under 
current  law,  these  stations  are  permitted  to  stay  in  the  band  until 
December  31,  2006,  or  when  85  percent  of  the  households  in  their 
market areas have the ability to receive DTV signals, whichever is 
later. 

In  the  meantime,  the  public-safety  spectrum  needs  identified  in 
1996  have  worsened,  especially  since  9/11,  as  police,  sheriffs,  fire, 
and  EMS,  and  other  public-safety  agencies  are  being  asked  to  as-
sume  greater  roles  in  protecting  homeland  security.  A  current  ex-
ample  is  last  week’s  tragic  bombings  in  London,  and  the  height-
ened security now placed on our Nation’s public transportation sys-
tems. 

Anytime  there  is  a  terrorist  attack  against  the  U.S.,  or  in  any 
other part of the world, public safety must have even more effective 
and  interoperable  radio  communications  capability.  Therefore,  the 
public-safety community supports legislative efforts that call for an 
early and firm date by which broadcasters must clear the channels 
occupied in the 700 megahertz band. 

The  700  megahertz  band  is  critical  for  public-safety  agencies  to 
alleviate  dangerous  congestion  on  many  existing  radio  systems, 
which places first responders and the public at risk. The spectrum 
also will facilitate new and expanded multi-agency communications

83 

systems  to  promote  interoperability  among  first  responders  in  the 
field. 

Finally,  additional  spectrum  will  allow  for  deployment  of  new 
public-safety communications technologies. However, until the Con-
gress  establishes  a  date  certain  for  TV  broadcasters  to  vacate  the 
700  megahertz  band,  most  public-safety  agencies,  and  state  and 
local  governments  cannot  begin  significant  planning  and  funding 
for new radio systems on that spectrum. The 9/11 Commission spe-
cifically  recommended  that  Congress  support  legislation  providing 
for  the  expedited  and  increased  assignment  of  radio  spectrum  for 
public-safety purposes. In response to this recommendation, the In-
telligence  Reform  and  Terrorism  Prevention  Act  of  2004,  included 
a  sense  of  the  Congress  that  this  issue  must  be  addressed  in  the 
First Session of the 109th Congress. 

In addition to our urgent need for the 24 megahertz of spectrum 
previously  allocated  by  Congress  for  public  safety,  the  tragic  ter-
rorist acts of September 11, 2001, and advances in technology have 
intensified  the  need  for  further  allocations  to  provide  for  public- 
safety-area wireless broadband data networks. 

In  order  to  aid  this  effort,  the  Intelligence  Reform  Act  required 
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  Federal  Commu-
nications  Commission  to  analyze  this  spectrum  requirement  and 
report back to Congress later this year. Therefore, we support lan-
guage  in  S.  1268,  the  SAVE  LIVES  Act,  that  would  permit  Con-
gress  to  designate  additional  public-safety  spectrum  in  the  700 
megahertz band following completion of those studies. 

In closing, I would again stress that the public-safety community 
supports  legislative  efforts  that  call  for  an  early  and  firm  date  by 
which  broadcasters  must  clear  these  channels  occupied  in  the  700 
megahertz band. 

Thank you very much.

assume  that  those  first  responders  will  get  the  call,  and  will  have  the  communica-
tions tools they need to address emergencies quickly and efficiently. 

Radio  spectrum  is  critical  for  public  safety  agencies  to  maintain  the  communica-
tions  capability  they  need  to  protect  the  safety  of  life  and  property.  However,  in 
1996,  a  blue  ribbon  committee  (the  Public  Safety  Wireless  Advisory  Committee  or 
‘‘PSWAC’’) determined that public safety agencies did not have sufficient radio spec-
trum to do their jobs. Among PSWAC’s recommendations was that 25 MHz of spec-
trum  be  made  available  from  TV  channels  60–69  (the  700  MHz  band)  within  5 
years.1 Congress  responded  in  1997,  by  directing  the  FCC  to  reallocate  24  MHz  of 
spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety services. 

Unfortunately, the 700 MHz band public safety spectrum continues to be blocked 
by television stations on channels 63, 64, 68, and 69 (and, to some degree, adjacent 
channels 62, 65, and 67), especially in major metropolitan areas. Under current law, 
these  stations  are  permitted  to  stay  in  the  band  until  December  31,  2006,  or  when 
85  percent  of  the  households  in  their  market  areas  have  the  ability  to  receive  DTV 
signals, whichever is later. 

In  the  meantime,  the  public  safety  spectrum  needs  identified  in  1996  have  wors-
ened,  especially  since  9/11,  as  police,  sheriffs,  fire,  EMS,  and  other  public  safety 
agencies  are  being  asked  to  assume  greater  roles  in  protecting  homeland  security. 
A current example is last week’s tragic bombings in London, and the heightened se-
curity  now  placed  on  our  Nation’s  public  transportation  systems.  Any  time  there  is 
a  terrorist  attack  against  the  U.S.  or  in  any  other  part  of  the  world,  public  safety 
must  have  even  more  effective  and  interoperable  radio  communications  capability. 
Therefore,  the  public  safety  community  supports  legislative  efforts  that  call  for  an 
early  and  firm  date  by  which  broadcasters  must  clear  the  channels  occupied  in  the 
700 MHz band. 

The 700 MHz band spectrum is critical for public safety agencies to alleviate dan-
gerous congestion on many existing radio systems, which places first responders and 
the public at risk. In much of the nation, there are no longer any frequencies avail-
able  for  new  or  expanded  public  safety  radio  systems.  As  a  result,  too  many  first 
responders are crowded on common channels, blocking critical communications, both 
on  a  day-to-day  basis  and,  especially,  when  major  emergencies  occur.  Once  cleared 
of TV stations, the 700 MHz band channels will facilitate expansion of public safety 
systems  already  operating  in  the  adjacent  800  MHz  band,  and  the  construction  of 
many new public safety radio systems across the Nation. 

A  key  benefit  of  the  700  MHz  band  spectrum  is  that  it  will  allow  for  new  and 
expanded  multi-agency  communications  systems  to  promote  interoperability  among 
first responders in the field. While there are many causes and solutions to the inter-
operability  problem,  in  many  cases  the  most  effective  long-term  solution  is  to  con-
solidate  agencies  on  the  same  radio  system,  or  at  least  on  systems  in  compatible 
frequency  bands.  Some  states  and  counties  have  built  such  multi-agency  systems 
(often in the now-crowded 800 MHz band), and many others would do so if sufficient 
radio  spectrum  were  available.  Clearing  the  700  MHz  spectrum  would  also  allow 
many existing 800 MHz systems to expand their capacity to accommodate additional 
public  safety  agencies.  The  FCC  rules  for  the  700  MHz  band  also  ensure  that  all 
radios  operating  within  the  700  MHz  band  will  include  designated  interoperability 
channels and a common digital interoperability standard (Project 25). 

Additional  spectrum  will  also  allow  for  deployment  of  new  public  safety  commu-
nications technologies, such as mobile data networks that will provide first respond-
ers with access to critical information in the field. Today, agencies seeking to imple-
ment new data networks are often stymied by the lack of sufficient radio spectrum. 
The public safety benefits of the 700 MHz band are very real. However, until Con-
gress  establishes  a  date  certain  for  TV  broadcasters  to  vacate  the  700  MHz  band, 
most  public  safety  agencies  and  state/local  governments  cannot  begin  significant 
planning and funding for new radio systems in that spectrum. 

The  9/11  Commission  specifically  recommended  that  Congress  support  legislation 
providing  ‘‘for  the  expedited  and  increased  assignment  of  radio  spectrum  for  public 
safety  purposes.’’  In  response  to  this  recommendation,  the  Intelligence  Reform  and 
Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, included a Sense of Congress that this issue must 
be addressed in the First Session of the 109th Congress. 

In  addition  to  our  urgent  need  for  the  24  MHz  of  spectrum  previously  allocated 
by  Congress  for  public  safety,  the  tragic  terrorist  acts  of  September  11,  2001,  and 
advances  in  technology  have  intensified  the  need  for  further  allocations  to  provide 
for  public  safety  wide-area  wireless  broadband  data  networks.  The  National  Intel-

1 As  I  and  others  have  often  noted,  the  date  of  the  PSWAC  report  was  September  11,  1996. 
Exactly  5  years  later,  on  September  11,  2001,  the  spectrum  identified  by  PSWAC  was  still  not 
available for public safety use in most of the Nation.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
The  next  witness  is  Charles  Townsend,  who  is  the  Chairman— 

I guess you’re CEO of Aloha Partners. 

STATEMENT OF CHARLES C. TOWNSEND, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

ALOHA PARTNERS, LP 

Mr. TOWNSEND. Thank you. 
Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Stevens,  Co-Chairman  Inouye,  and 

members of the Committee. 

My  name  is  Charlie  Townsend,  and  I’m  President  and  Founder 
of Aloha Partners. I’ve been in the telecommunications industry for 
the  past  25  years,  and  I  have  founded  two  cellular  telephone  com-
panies, and been President of one cable TV company. 

About 5 years ago, I concluded that wireless broadband business 
had the potential to be as successful as the cellular telephone busi-
ness is today; however, the key to that success will be the spectrum 
that is used to deliver the service. 

I believe that 700 megahertz is the optimum spectrum to deliver 
wireless broadband. As a result, I founded Aloha Partners in 2001, 
and was the largest buyer of licenses in the original 700 megahertz 
auction. Aloha has invested over $100 million in 700 megahertz li-
censes.  It  is  now  the  largest  700  megahertz  licensee,  holding  li-
censes that cover over 175 million people, roughly 60 percent of the 
United States. 

Aloha  has  been  actively  evaluating  potential  uses  for  700  mega-
hertz  spectrum  for  the  past  3  years,  and  is  planning  on  launching 
several  market  trials  in  the  next  12  months.  Aloha  has  also  been 
approached by a number of Fortune 500 companies about potential 
joint ventures and uses of the spectrum. 

As  a  result,  Aloha  is  in  a  unique  position  to  provide  the  Com-
mittee  with  information  regarding  potential  uses  of  the  700  mega-
hertz  spectrum,  who  is  likely  to  bid  for  the  remaining  licenses  in 
the 700 megahertz auction, and what the benefits of the DTV tran-
sition are likely to be. 

The  DTV  transition  offers  five  major  benefits  for  U.S.  house-

holds. I will focus on two of them today: 

The first is broadband. The United States is lagging behind other 
developed  countries  in  broadband  penetration.  This  is  primarily 
due  to  two  factors—the  lack  of  availability  of  broadband  in  rural 
regions of the United States, and the lack of broadband competition 
in urban markets. 

Last  year,  the  Pew  Charitable  Trust  conducted  an  extensive 
study of broadband in rural and urban markets. The study showed 
that  25  percent  of  all  American  homes  only  have  access  to  one  or 
no  broadband  providers.  The  study  also  showed  that  nearly  one  in 
three  rural  homes  do  not  have  access  to  any  form  of  broadband.

86 

Seven  hundred  megahertz  frequencies  have  the  potential  to  solve 
both of these problems, because 700 megahertz is the most cost-ef-
fective frequency available to provide wireless broadband service. 

In  addition  to  broadband,  Aloha  believes  a  number  of  Fortune 
500 companies plan to use 700 megahertz for new wireless services. 
These  companies  fall  into  two  groups:  the  companies  planning  to 
use  700  megahertz  for  WiMAX  broadband  technology  and  compa-
nies  planning  to  use  700  megahertz  for  mobile  TV.  Aloha  believes 
that the companies that will participate in the 700 megahertz auc-
tion  include  major  cable  companies,  such  as  Comcast,  Cox,  and 
Time Warner. These companies recognize that they need a wireless 
product  to  bundle  with  their  telephone  and  video  offerings.  Major 
ISPs like AOL, AT&T, and Covad recognize that they can no longer 
rely  on  the  Bell  operating  companies  to  deliver  their  broadband 
product,  and  they  will  need  700  megahertz  spectrum  to  bridge  the 
last mile. 

Aloha believes that a second group of bidders is interested in of-
fering  mobile  TV  and  mobile  music.  Most  major  entertainment 
companies  are  likely  to  recognize  that  mobile  TV  and  music  serv-
ices  will  be  the  next  major  growth  industry  in  the  entertainment 
business. As a result, potential bidders may include companies like 
Sony, Disney, and Time Warner that will want to control the tech-
nology and method of distribution for this market. 

However,  it  is  important  to  appreciate  that  all  of  these  compa-
nies  recognize  that  time-to-market  is  critical  for  their  success.  At 
present,  it  appears  that  the  remaining  60  megahertz  of  700  mega-
hertz  spectrum  will  not  be  available  for  another  3  years.  Any  fur-
ther  delay  in  getting  to  market  is  likely  to  influence  their  willing-
ness  to  participate  in  the  auction,  or  pay  significant  sums  for  the 
spectrum. 

In conclusion, Aloha has been fortunate to purchase a large block 
of 700 megahertz and be exposed to many opportunities to use 700 
megahertz, for wireless broadband, and mobile TV and music serv-
ices. Aloha is prepared to bid on additional 700 megahertz licenses 
as  soon  as  they  are  available.  Aloha  urges  this  Senate  Commerce 
Committee  to  accelerate  the  DTV  transition  so  that  these  addi-
tional services may be available. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHARLES C. TOWNSEND, PRESIDENT, ALOHA PARTNERS, LP 
My  name  is  Charlie  Townsend,  and  I  am  the  President  and  Founder  of  Aloha 
Partners. I have been in the telecommunications industry for the past 25 years, and 
have been President of three cellular companies and one cable TV company. I found-

Aloha  has  been  actively  evaluating  potential  uses  for  700  MHz  spectrum  for  the 
past 3 years, and is planning on launching several market trials in the next twelve 
months.  Aloha  also  has  been  approached  by  a  number  of  Fortune  500  companies 
about potential joint ventures and uses of its spectrum. 

As a result, Aloha is in a unique position to provide this Committee with informa-
tion  regarding  potential  uses  of  700  MHz  spectrum;  who  is  likely  to  bid  for  the  re-
maining licenses in the 700 MHz auction; and what the benefits of the DTV Transi-
tion are likely to be. 

The DTV Transition offers five major benefits for U.S. households: 

(1) Better Television Picture Quality 
(2) More Broadband Competition 
(3) New Wireless Services 
(4) Better Emergency Communications 
(5) Value to the U.S. Economy 

Better Television Picture Quality 

Nearly  10  years  ago,  the  Senate  passed  the  original  DTV  legislation.  You  envi-
sioned that consumers would receive better picture quality and more channels. That 
vision is as true today as it was a decade ago. Digital TV will significantly improve 
television  pictures  for  everyone . . . not  just  for  those  who  have  digital  TV  sets. 
Digital TV signals are less affected by interference than analog signals and usually 
provide  clearer  pictures  than  traditional  analog  reception.  Digital  signals  eliminate 
the  ghosting  and  snow  that  many  over-the-air  households  currently  experience. 
Most people have focused on the benefits that people with new digital sets and high 
definition  sets  will  receive.  These  newer  television  sets  are  primarily  in  cable  and 
satellite  homes.  Little  attention  has  been  focused  on  the  significant  improvement 
that  will  be  seen  on  analog  sets  in  over-the-air  homes.  I  would  like  to  focus  on  the 
benefits  that  people  with  analog  over-the-air  sets  will  receive.  Last  week,  I  person-
ally  visited  Motorola’s  office  here  in  Washington,  and  was  able  to  see  a  demonstra-
tion of their latest digital set-top box. This allowed me to compare what a DTV sig-
nal looks like when you use a converter for your analog over-the-air television. Mo-
torola  showed  side-by-side  comparisons  of  the  current  over-the-air  analog  picture 
and  the  new  over-the-air  digital  picture  when  seen  on  an  analog  set.  I  am  glad  to 
report  that  I  did  not  need  an  electrical  engineering  degree  to  tell  the  difference. 
While  I  am  not  a  technical  expert  on  television  picture  quality,  I  would  say  there 
was  a  significant  improvement  in  the  digital  signal  viewed  on  the  analog  set,  prob-
ably a 25–50 percent improvement. Not only was the picture quality more vivid and 
bright  with  the  digital  Over-The-Air  picture,  but  the  snow  and  picture  fade  that  I 
could  see  on  the  analog  television  set  was  absent  from  the  digital  picture.  My  con-
clusion  was  that  if  you  can  give  everyone  access  to  those  new  digital  signals,  you 
are going to have a lot of very happy Over-The-Air television viewers out there. 
More Broadband Competition 

Broadband  has  the  potential  to  be  one  of  this  country’s  key  economic  engines  for 
the  next  10  years.  Unfortunately,  the  United  States  is  falling  behind  countries  like 
China,  Japan,  Korea,  and  even  Iceland,  with  respect  to  broadband.  This  is  due  in 
considerable  part  to  two  factors:  the  lack  of  availability  of  broadband  in  rural  re-
gions  of  the  U.S.,  and  the  lack  of  broadband  competition  in  urban  markets.  Last 
year, the Pew Charitable Trust conducted an extensive study of broadband in rural 
and  urban  areas.  That  study  showed  that  25  percent  of  all  American  homes  only 
have  access  to  one  or  no  broadband  providers.  The  study  also  showed  that  nearly 
one  in  three  rural  homes  do  not  have  access  to  any  form  of  broadband.  700  MHz 
frequencies  have  the  potential  to  solve  both  of  these  problems;  because  700  MHz  is 
the most cost-effective frequency available to provide wireless broadband. 

Studies  have  consistently  shown  that  700  MHz  can  provide  broadband  service  in 
rural  areas  at  half  to  one  third  the  cost  of  the  1900  MHz  personal  communications 
services  frequencies  used  by  the  cellular  carriers  (see  Attachment).  700  MHz  can 
provide  broadband  services  in  rural  areas  at  one  fourth  to  one  sixth  the  cost  of  the 
2400  MHz  WiFi  and  MMDS  (now  BRS)  frequencies  used  by  unlicensed  owners  and 
by  companies  such  as  Sprint  and  Nextel.  700  MHz  has  the  advantage  of  traveling 
further  and  being  able  to  penetrate  walls,  dense  foliage,  and  other  obstructions 
without the deterioration of signal experienced with either 1900 MHz or 2400 MHz 
wireless  transmissions.  These  features  make  700  MHz  the  ideal  frequency  for  pro-
viding wireless broadband in both rural and urban markets. Not only can 700 MHz 
be  used  to  provide  high-speed  Internet  access,  but  it  can  also  offer  low-cost  VoIP 
service  for  voice  customers.  What  this  means  is  that  rural  areas  that  were  pre-
viously ‘‘unreachable’’ can now get broadband service on an affordable basis.

The Digital Divide Can Be Closed 

America  has  always  been  a  land  of  opportunity.  However,  the  advancements  in 
Internet  access  have  not  made  those  opportunities  available  to  everyone.  Late  last 
year, the NTIA announced results of an additional study of broadband in rural and 
urban  areas.  The  NTIA  findings  were  very  similar  to  those  in  the  Pew  Internet 
study. NTIA concluded, however, that differences in broadband penetration are due 
not  to  lack  of  interest  in  broadband,  but  rather  to  lack  of  broadband  availability  in 
rural  areas.  Almost  one  out  of  four  homes  in  rural  areas  have  no  access  to 
broadband  service,  compared  to  urban  areas  where  95  percent  of  homes  can  get  at 
least one broadband provider. The NTIA concluded that wireless technologies using 
frequencies  like  700  MHz  ‘‘are  better  suited  at  present  than  cable  or  DSL  for  pro-
viding  high-speed  Internet  access  in  areas  whose  population  density  is  low.’’  In  es-
sence,  broadband  has  created  two  groups  of  households:  the  haves  and  the  have- 
nots. The 700 MHz spectrum can close that gap. 
The Rural Paradox 

Some  broadcasters  have  portrayed  rural  areas  as  having  the  most  to  lose  in  the 
DTV  transition.  Paradoxically,  rural  areas  are  likely  to  lose  the  least  and  gain  the 
most from the DTV transition. Compared to urban areas, rural areas will likely face 
fewer transition issues because cable and satellite service penetration rates already 
are high, and rising, in rural areas. At the same time, broadband availability is low 
and unlikely to rise unless 700 MHz spectrum is freed-up for this purpose. 

For  example,  Montana  has  an  estimated  86  percent  of  its  homes  covered  by  sat-
ellite  and  cable.  That  leaves  about  50,000  of  the  households  that  are  receiving  TV 
Over-The-Air  and  potentially  in  need  of  assistance  to  complete  the  transition.  On 
the other hand, more than 175,000 households are estimated to be unable to receive 
broadband  because  they  live  in  low-density  areas.  In  other  words,  the  number  of 
households in Montana that are being deprived of broadband is over three times as 
large as the number of households that may be affected by the DTV transition. Mon-
tana is not an isolated case. A number of states represented on this committee face 
the  same  situation:  Arkansas,  Louisiana,  Maine,  Mississippi,  Nebraska,  North  Da-
kota, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. The beauty of the DTV transition 
is  that  these  states  will  be  the  biggest  beneficiaries  of  the  transition;  because  the 
DTV  transition  not  only  will  solve  their  broadband  problem,  but  also  will  deliver 
better TV reception to Over-The-Air households in the process. 
Aloha Introductory Markets 

Aloha plans to conduct several trial markets to demonstrate the 700 MHz benefits 
for wireless broadband. Later this year, Aloha will launch a trial in Tucson, Arizona, 
to  demonstrate  the  700  MHz  coverage  advantages  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas. 
In the first half of 2006, Aloha will launch a trial in a top 20 market to demonstrate 
how  public  safety  groups  and  commercial  broadband  can  be  combined  on  the  same 
network and integrated together. 
New Wireless Services 

Based  on  discussions  Aloha  has  had  with  a  number  of  Fortune  500  companies, 
Aloha  expects  the  700  MHZ  auction  to  be  highly  competitive.  Aloha  believes  that 
these  companies  plan  to  use  700  MHz  for  a  number  of  new  wireless  services.  The 
potential  bidders  probably  will  fall  into  two  groups:  (1)  companies  planning  to  use 
700  MHz  for  WiMax  broadband  technology  and  (2)  companies  planning  to  use  700 
MHz for Mobile TV. 

Aloha  believes  that  the  companies  that  may  participate  in  the  700  MHz  auction 
include  major  cable  companies  like  Comcast,  Cox,  and  Time  Warner.  These  compa-
nies recognize that they need a wireless product to bundle with their telephone and 
video offerings. Major ISPs like AOL, AT&T, and Covad recognize that they can no 
longer rely on the Bell operating companies to deliver their broadband product and 
that  they  will  need  700  MHz  spectrum  to  bridge  the  last  mile.  Large  satellite  com-
panies like EchoStar and DIRECTV and wireless operators like T-Mobile, Alltel, and 
Clearwire  also  will  be  interested  in  using  700  MHz  WiMax  to  compete  in  both  the 
data and VoIP markets. 

Aloha  believes  that  the  second  group  of  bidders  is  interested  in  offering  Mobile 
TV  and  Mobile  Music.  Qualcomm  already  owns  some  700  MHz  spectrum  and  has 
announced  an  $800  million  commitment  to  roll  out  Mobile  TV  and  Music  services 
nationwide.  Crown  Castle  also  owns  spectrum  and  plans  to  roll  out  Mobile  TV  and 
Music services in major markets next year. Major entertainment companies are like-
ly  to  recognize  that  mobile  TV  and  music  services  will  be  the  next  major  growth 
opportunity in the media entertainment business. As a result, potential bidders may

include companies like Sony, Disney, and Time Warner that will want to control the 
technology and method of distribution for this new market. 

However,  it  is  important  to  appreciate  that  all  of  these  companies  recognize  that 
‘‘time-to-market’’ is critical for their success. At present, it appears that the remain-
ing  60  MHz  of  700  MHz  spectrum  will  not  be  available  for  another  3  years.  Any 
further  delay  in  getting  to  market  is  likely  to  influence  their  willingness  to  partici-
pate in the auction or pay significant sums for the spectrum. 
Better Emergency Communications 

Many  people  have  discussed  the  value  that  700  MHz  can  bring  public  safety 
through  voice  communications  and  low-speed  data.  However,  there  are  also  some 
significant benefits that can come from 700 MHz high-speed Internet access as well. 
Police  can  compare  on-line  finger  prints  and  watch  videos  real-time  to  monitor 
emergency  situations.  Fire  Departments  can  view  schematics  of  buildings  and  haz-
ardous material locations while at the scene of a fire. And EMTs can transmit EKGs 
and send videos of injuries from the location of the emergency. 
Value to U.S. Economy Is Significant 

Aloha has estimated in previous filings with the House Commerce Committee that 
the remaining 700 MHz spectrum could generate between $20 to $30 billion for the 
U.S. Treasury if an auction were held in the near future. Since that filing, a number 
of noted economists have indicated that the benefits to the U.S. economy should not 
be viewed solely in terms of one-time auction revenues, but also in terms of broader 
economic  potential.  Coleman  Bazelon,  noted  economist  and  Vice  President  of  the 
Analysis  Group,  has  estimated  that  the  700  MHz  spectrum  could  generate  up  to 
$475 billion in benefits to the U.S. economy. 
The Sooner the 700 MHz Auction the Better 

There has been some discussion that delaying the 700 MHz auction may be bene-
ficial.  However,  it  is  unclear  to  me  who  will  benefit  from  any  further  delays.  The 
sooner the spectrum is auctioned: 

1. The sooner millions of U.S. television viewers will see significantly improved 
pictures. 
2. The sooner there will be additional broadband competition in urban and rural 
markets. 
3.  The  sooner  new  wireless  services  will  be  available  throughout  the  country. 
4. The sooner emergency communications will be improved. 
5.  The  sooner  the  U.S.  economy  will  generate  up  to  $475  billion  in  economic 
benefits. 
Conclusions 

Aloha  has  been  fortunate  to  purchase  a  large  block  of  700  MHz,  and  be  exposed 
to  many  opportunities  to  use  700  MHz  for  Wireless  Broadband  and  Mobile  TV  and 
Music services. Aloha is prepared to bid on additional 700 MHz licenses as soon as 
they  are  available.  The  United  States  economy,  TV  households,  rural  communities, 
and  first  responders  will  all  be  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  auction  of  700  MHz  spec-
trum.  Aloha  urges  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee  to  accelerate  the  DTV  transi-
tion so that these benefits will be realized sooner rather than later.

STATEMENT  OF  GENE  KIMMELMAN,  SENIOR  DIRECTOR  OF 
PUBLIC  POLICY  AND  ADVOCACY,  CONSUMERS  UNION;  ON 
BEHALF  OF  CONSUMERS  UNION  AND  CONSUMER 
FEDERATION OF AMERICA 
Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Co-Chairman 
Inouye, members of the Committee. On behalf of Consumers Union, 
the print and online publisher of Consumer Reports, we appreciate 
the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  We  totally  concur  with  the  notion 
that  it  is  time  for  more  spectrum  to  be  made  available  for  public 
safety,  and  endorse  your  desires  to  free  up  the  analog  spectrum 
that broadcasters have been using. But I want to spend a few min-
utes  with  you  walking  through,  in  practical  terms,  what  it  means 
for consumers. 

You  heard  the  back  and  forth  between  the  cable  and  broadcast 
industry  earlier  today  as  to  how  the  market  could  or  should  work. 
This  is  a  funny  market  for  consumers.  As  the  Committee  well 
knows,  this  is  one  of  those  markets  where  more  players  come  in, 
there’s more technology than ever before, and prices keep going up 
and  up,  and  it  doesn’t  quite  seem  to  work  the  way  competition  is 
supposed to. 

So, what happens here with people’s TVs? Well, by our surveying 
we  find  that  there  still  are  at  least  15  percent  of  American  con-
suming households that just rely on over-the-air television. I think 
most  surveys  show  similar  numbers.  More  than  16  million  house-
holds  get  their  television  service  over-the-air.  When  you  cutoff  the 
analog signal, those television sets will not work. 

But  that’s  not  the  whole  story.  In  asking  consumers  who  get 
cable  and  satellite  whether  they  also  have  television  sets  that  are 
not hooked up to those services, we find that there are as many as 
45  million  additional  sets  that  consumers  say  are  not  used  for 
DVDs,  are  not  used  to  play  games,  that  are  used  to  receive  over- 
the-air  signals,  in  addition  to  their  cable  and  satellite  hookups. 
Those  analog  sets  will  also  go  black  after  this  transition.  And  we 
find,  as  you  well  know,  most  consumers  don’t  just  have  one  tele-
vision set; on average, they have at least two. 

So, what’s the issue for consumers? Well, these are all folks who 
went  out  and  bought  a  television,  where  the  retailers  told  them, 
manufacturers told them, ‘‘It will work. It’ll receive over-the-air sig-
nals.’’ They have a full expectation that every dollar they spent on 
those sets would get them over-the-air signals. 

If  you  transition,  give  back  analog  spectrum  for  a  very  worthy 
cause,  for  public  safety  and  for  more  competition,  those  people  are 
left in the dark without a converter box, like Mr. Kennedy is show-
ing you. Who pays? 

Well,  there  obviously  are  concerns  here  for  low-income  con-
sumers,  people  of  limited  resources.  There  are  concerns  in  rural 
areas,  where  television  service  may  be  more  important  than  any-
where else. And we believe those people ought to be held harmless. 
But  think  about  it  for  a  minute.  Why  should  anyone—anyone,  re-
gardless  of  income—have  to  pay  just  to  keep  their  television  set 
working,  particularly  in  an  area  where  we’re  talking  about  freeing 
up  spectrum  to  auction  off,  as  Mr.  Townsend  indicates,  to  many 
highly  well-financed  commercial  entities  that  want  to  enter  the 
market, provide new services, and that will be bringing in revenue

for the Federal Treasury? Why not use those proceeds, the first dol-
lars  available  from  those  auctions,  to  ensure  that  consumers  are 
not  worse  off  as  a  result  of  this  transition?  Let’s  make  sure  that 
people’s TV sets keep working. And let’s also make sure that what 
we get out of this truly is a benefit to the public. 

Mr.  Townsend  indicates  a  wonderful  new  development,  more 
competition  in  the  broadband  area—we  welcome  that,  but  we  also 
note  that,  in  the  other  part  of  this  marketplace,  we’ve  had  enor-
mous  consolidation.  SBC  buying  AT&T,  Verizon  buying  MCI.  We 
see  very  few  options,  as  Mr.  Townsend  pointed  out,  for  broadband 
service,  and  a  great  need,  particularly  for  rural  and  lower-income 
people. Wireless broadband offers a possibility of prices as much as 
50  percent  lower  than  many  of  the  offerings  we’re  seeing  in  the 
marketplace today, from cable modem service, from the Bell compa-
nies  with  their  DSL  services.  It’s  critical  that,  if  you  move  to  free 
up  this  spectrum  and  put  it  out  to  auction,  that  we  not  allow  the 
largest companies that currently dominate the market to dominate 
it even further. 

And,  finally,  with  all  this  spectrum  available  and  the  important 
needs  of  broadband,  we  urge  you  to  consider  really  creating  an 
open  space,  some  unlicensed  area  where  new  players  can  come  in 
using  new  technologies—WiFi  mesh  networks—to  bring  us  more 
choices,  more  competition.  The  competition  you  heard  about  this 
morning  between  broadcasters  and  cable  is  a  funny  kind  of  com-
petition.  It’s  over  numbers  of  channels  on  the  system,  it’s  over  ad 
revenue. 

Senator Ensign, you pointed out that consumers ought to be able 
to  pick  the  winners  and  losers.  I’m  totally  with  you  on  that.  Con-
sumers all want that. The problem is, cable companies decide what 
channels  go  on  their  systems.  Consumers  don’t  decide  what  chan-
nels  go  on.  Broadcasters  decide  what  cable  channels  they’re  going 
to bundle with their broadcast channels and pressure cable compa-
nies  to  either  take  them  or  leave  them.  Broadcasters  offer  a  won-
derful local service, but do you realize that half of all broadcasters 
in this country don’t even do local news? Do not even produce local 
news? There are a lot of problems in what cable and broadcast are 
offering.  I  leave  it  to  you  to  pick  the  winners  and  losers  there. 
What’s important for consumers is to have—to win by having more 
choices in the marketplace. 

So, we urge you, as you go through this transition and bring back 
spectrum, please hold consumers harmless, and please devise rules 
so that we end up with more players, more competition, and, hope-
fully,  more  broadband  available  so  that  consumers  get  better  serv-
ices at lower prices. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GENE KIMMELMAN,  SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY 
AND ADVOCACY,  CONSUMERS UNION;  ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS UNION AND 
CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA 
Consumers  Union 1 and  Consumer  Federation  of  America 2 appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity to testify on the transition from analog to digital television. The digital tran-
sition,  as  envisioned  by  the  1996  Telecommunications  Act,  has  failed,  requiring  ad-
ditional Congressional action. That legislation will determine whether the transition 
to digital television will ultimately benefit American consumers with more program-
ming  and  telecommunications  choices,  or  whether  it  will  impose  billions  in  direct 
costs on consumers and exacerbate concentration in telecommunications markets. 

To ensure the outcome is the former not the latter, any legislation that this Com-

mittee takes up on the digital transition must: 

• Ensure that consumers do not bear the direct costs of the transition, which are 
estimated to be $3.5 billion or more, or suffer from the loss of television signals 
they rightfully expect to receive; 

• Promote market competition, rather than consolidation, through appropriate al-
location  of  the  108  MHz  of  returned  spectrum  to  new  entrants  and  smaller  ex-
isting market players, particularly in the area of broadband wireless; 

• Promote  unlicensed,  or  open-market,  use  of  spectrum  by  both  commercial  and 
noncommercial  entities  of  a  portion  of  either  the  reclaimed  or  digital  spectrum 
to  promote  competition,  foster  advanced  communications  services,  and  bridge 
the digital divide by promoting universal, affordable access to broadband Inter-
net; and 

• Prevent  further  concentration  of  local  media  markets  by  addressing  ownership 
restrictions  for  dominant  local  broadcast  outlets  in  the  post-transition,  digital 
environment. 

We  look  forward  to  working  with  members  of  the  Committee  to  ensure  that  any 
legislation on the digital television transition incorporates these core consumer pro-
visions. We elaborate on these critical needs below. 
Hold Consumers Harmless 

Consumers buy televisions with the reasonable expectation that they will be able 
to  receive  free  over-the-air  television  broadcasts  over  the  life  of  their  televisions. 
And  that  life  can  be  substantial.  Research  from  Consumer  Reports  shows  that  tele-
visions  are  the  workhorses  of  consumer  electronics:  they  last  for  decades.  Even 
today,  as  Congress  focuses  on  a  hard  digital  television  transition  date,  millions  of 
consumers  are  buying  new  analog  sets  on  the  assumption  they  will  work  for  years 
to  come.  A  federally  mandated  transition  to  digital  turns  that  assumption  on  its 
head: for consumers relying on over-the-air broadcasts, their sets will be useless for 
their primary purpose. 

An  artificial,  government-imposed  mandatory  transition  to  broadcasting  solely 
using  digital  signals  will  create,  at  a  minimum,  a  monumental  inconvenience  for 
consumers who will be forced to purchase a costly converter box to ensure their tele-
visions  will  keep  working.  And  if  Congress  gets  this  wrong,  the  transition  will  not 
merely  inconvenience  consumers,  which  is  nuisance  enough,  it  will  impose  on  them 
direct costs of $3.5 billion or more. 

Therefore,  any  conversion  to  digital  television  must  ensure  that  the  analog  sets 
now in use will continue to function after the transition without imposing additional 
costs on consumers. 

The  number  of  consumers  that  could  be  left  in  the  dark  by  the  digital  transition 
is substantial. New consumer research conducted by Consumers Union and the Con-

1 Consumers Union is a nonprofit membership organization chartered in 1936, under the laws 
of  the  State  of  New  York  to  provide  consumers  with  information,  education  and  counsel  about 
goods, services, health and personal finances, and to initiate and cooperate with individual and 
group efforts to maintain and enhance the quality of life for consumers. Consumers Union’s in-
come  is  solely  derived  from  the  sale  of  Consumer  Reports,  its  other  publications  and  from  non-
commercial  contributions,  grants  and  fees.  In  addition  to  reports  on  Consumers  Union’s  own 
product  testing,  Consumer  Reports  with  more  than  5  million  paid  circulation,  regularly,  carries 
articles on health, product safety, marketplace economics and legislative, judicial and regulatory 
actions which affect consumer welfare. Consumers Union’s publications carry no advertising and 
receive no commercial support. 

2 The Consumer Federation of America is the Nation’s largest consumer advocacy group, com-
posed  of  over  280  state  and  local  affiliates  representing  consumer,  senior  citizen,  low-income, 
labor,  farm,  public  power,  and  cooperative  organizations,  with  more  than  50  million  individual 
members.

sumer  Federation  of  America 3 shows  that  about  four  in  ten  American  households, 
or  about  42  million  households,  continue  to  rely  on  about  80  million  over-the-air 
televisions (OTA-only sets) for some or all of their television viewing. Given very low 
sales of digital-ready televisions in recent years, virtually all of these sets are likely 
to be capable of receiving only analog signals. 

Of  the  42  million  households  with  OTA-only  sets,  about  16  million  rely  solely  on 
about  35  million  over-the-air  televisions  to  watch  television  programming.  The  re-
maining 26 million households with OTA-only sets are those that subscribe to cable 
and  satellite  services,  but  also  rely  on  up  to  an  additional  45  million  OTA-only 
sets—those not connected to the subscription service but used for over-the-air broad-
cast program viewing. These are sets that are used, for example, in the kids’ rooms, 
the  kitchen,  the  home  office,  and  so  forth.  For  cable/satellite  households,  our  esti-
mates explicitly excluded unconnected sets that were NOT used at all for broadcast 
viewing. 

We  present  these  estimates  not  as  exact  numbers  of  households  and  analog  sets 
directly  affected  by  the  transition,  but  rather  as  an  indicator  of  what  the  ‘‘real’’ 
numbers  are  likely  to  be.  There  has  been  substantial  confusion  over  the  number  of 
over-the-air reliant households to which Congress will need to provide compensation 
for the costs of converter boxes required to keep their otherwise fully functional TV 
sets working. At the high-end were estimates by the National Association of Broad-
casters and the Government Accountability Office that found 73 million over-the-air 
sets in use. At the low-end were estimates by the Consumer Electronics Association 
that  found  only  33  million  such  sets.  Based  on  our  research,  we  believe  the  latter 
estimate  dramatically  understates  the  number  of  over-the-air  reliant  sets,  and  that 
the  NAB/GAO  estimates  are  more  likely  in-line  with  reality.  Even  after  adjusting 
the NAB estimates by different assumptions, such as the number of sets per house-
holds,  65  million  represents  the  lower  bound  estimate  of  the  number  of  OTA  sets 
in American households. 

As  Congress  considers  whether  and  how  much  to  compensate  consumers  for  the 
costs  imposed  on  them  by  the  government-mandated  transition,  CU  and  CFA  be-
lieve  it  should  allocate  proceeds  from  the  auction  of  reclaimed  spectrum  to  a  com-
pensation  program  in  an  amount  which  reflects  the  number  of  OTA-only  sets  and 
OTA-only  households  at  the  highe-  end  of  estimates  provided  to  date.  Relying  on 
lower  estimates  could  lead  Congress  to  understate  the  number  of  households  af-
fected,  the  total  costs  to  consumers  and  the  level  of  the  compensation  necessary  to 
hold  consumers  harmless  from  the  Congressionally-mandated  transition  to  digital 
television. 

Based  on  higher  estimates  of  OTA-only  sets  and  the  GAO’s  estimate  of  a  cost  of 
$50  per  converter  box,  the  federally-imposed,  mandatory  transition  to  digital  TV 
could impose costs of $3.5 billion or more on consumers just to keep their sets work-
ing. 

As  shocking  as  these  aggregate  numbers  are,  the  costs  to  individual  households 
will  likewise  by  substantial.  The  digital  conversion  effectively  increases  the  cost  of 
television sets consumers have already purchased. According to the Consumer Elec-
tronics Association, a 25-inch television—the most popular set—sells, on average, for 
about $200. A $50 converter box effectively increases the cost of that set by 25 per-
cent. The costs of smaller sets selling for $100 would effectively increase by 50 per-
cent. Given that, according to both our estimates and those of the GAO, the average 
over-the-air household has two televisions, the costs for them are double—effectively 
a  consumer  tax  of  $100  or  more  just  to  facilitate  a  transition  that  benefits  broad-
casters, equipment makers, retailers, and other industry players. 

While  we  support  proposals  that  attempt  to  hold  cable  and  satellite  subscribers 
harmless  by  providing  for  down-conversion  of  digital  signals,  down-conversion  does 
not address unconnected analog sets in cable and satellite subscriber-households. As 
noted above, the some 25 million households that fall into this category have reason-
able  expectations  that  those  sets  will  continue  to  work.  These  households,  as  well 
as  those  that  rely  solely  on  over-the-air  programming,  should  be  compensated  for 
the costs of the converter boxes required to keep these sets working. 

We hope Congress agrees that this is an unacceptable cost for consumers to bear, 
regardless  of  their  income,  just  to  be  able  to  view  over-the-air  broadcasts  their  sets 
used to receive. 

Therefore, we urge Congress to establish and fully fund a program that will com-
pensate  all  households  that  continue  to  rely  on  over-the-air  sets  for  the  full  costs 
of  digital-to-analog  converter  boxes  required  to  keep  sets  functioning.  Even  using 
the conservative estimate of spectrum auction revenue of $10 billion that the digital

transition facilitates, the Committee would be able to both meet its budget reconcili-
ation  obligations  and  fully  compensate  all  households  with  over-the-air  reliant  sets 
for the costs of converter boxes. 

This  principle  is  not  new  to  Congress.  The  Commercial  Spectrum  Enhancement 
Act  (CSEA),  enacted  in  2003,  has  been  instrumental  in  encouraging  the  develop-
ment  of  new  uses  for  spectrum.  But  that  law  also  stipulates  that  auction  proceeds 
must cover 110 percent of the costs of relocation. For DTV transition legislation, the 
Committee therefore should adopt a principle similar to that embodied in the CSEA. 
Consumers have not demanded or driven this transition, which largely benefits oth-
ers,  and  they  should  not  be  asked  to  bear  its  costs.  According  to  the  New  America 
Foundation, sales of televisions with digital broadcast tuners represented just 4 per-
cent  of  all  televisions  sales  in  2004,  suggesting  consumer  demand  for  digitally 
broadcast television is quite small. Indeed, the transition largely benefits other par-
ties: the broadcasters who requested the transition in the first place; the electronics 
manufacturing  industry  which  will  sell  millions  of  converter  boxes  and  expensive 
digital  televisions;  and  the  dominant  telecommunications  providers  that  seek  li-
censes for the additional spectrum freed by the transition. 

The  digital  transition  may,  if  managed  appropriately,  provide  significant  public 
benefits.  But,  unquestionably,  it  will  be  viewed  as  an  abject  failure  by  consumers 
if they are forced to bear the costs of acquiring digital-to-analog converter boxes, or 
face  the  equally  unpalatable  alternative  of  losing  access  to  over-the-air  television. 
Promote Market Competition With Licensed and Open-Market Spectrum 

Congress  has  the  unique  and  important  opportunity  during  this  transition  to  en-
sure  that  reclaimed  spectrum  will  be  used  to  facilitate  robust  competition  in  the 
broadband market—providing new opportunities for smaller companies, new market 
entrants,  and  other  wireless  providers  to  access  valuable  spectrum  that  will  allow 
them to better serve their customers and effectively compete in the marketplace. 

Statistics  supplied  by  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  and  JPMorgan 
show  that  the  high-speed  data  marketplace  is  highly  concentrated;  in  fact,  it  has 
become a cozy duopoly. Cable providers and telephone companies have each divided 
and conquered their markets, and don’t compete against each other outside of their 
territories.  As  a  result  of  weak  competition,  broadband  penetration  in  the  U.S.  is 
proceeding  at  a  slower  rate  than  many  other  countries—the  U.S.  now  ranks  16th 
in  the  world.  Without  competitive  alternatives,  broadband  Internet  access  will  re-
main  a  service  available  only  to  consumers  in  those  markets  deemed  desirable  by 
dominant providers—and then only at the high prices these monopoly providers de-
mand. Rural and low income communities are left behind. Spectrum policies adopted 
as part of the digital transition can remedy the problem or exacerbate it. 

A  quick  glance  at  the  remaining  alternatives  demonstrates  that  it  is  up  to  Con-
gress,  through  the  spectrum  policies  it  designs  in  any  digital  transition  legislation, 
to provide new competitive opportunities in broadband: 

• Broadband-Over-Power-Lines  (BPL)  and  community  fiber-to-the-home  (FTTH): 
BPL is an exciting new technology that delivers broadband over a wire already 
available  in  nearly  every  home  in  the  country—electrical  wiring.  Though  its 
rollout  has  been  limited  to  date,  it  offers  significant  potential  for  the  delivery 
of  affordable,  high-speed  Internet.  Similarly,  FTTH  uses  fiber  initially  laid  by 
utilities  for  their  own  purposes,  like  meter-reading  to  deliver  broadband  serv-
ices.  In  some  communities,  publicly  owned  utilities  are  offering  high-speed 
Internet  through  BPL  and  FTTH.  Unfortunately,  despite  the  enormous  poten-
tial  for  these  technologies  to  facilitate  universal  broadband  access,  more  than 
a  dozen  states  have  erected  roadblocks—or  even  banned—communities  and  the 
utilities  they  own  from  providing  these  advanced  services.  These  roadblocks— 
and  Federal  preemption  efforts  like  those  already  introduced  in  the  House  of 
Representatives—could  prevent  BPL  and  FTTH  from  providing  ubiquitous  ac-
cess to broadband Internet. 
• Wireless  Broadband  (WiFi):  WiFi,  offered  today  by  many  by  Wireless  Internet 
Service  Providers  (WISPs)  across  many  of  America’s  cities  and  towns,  uses  a 
limited  band  of  unlicensed,  or  open-market  spectrum  that  was  originally  allo-
cated to it because no one else wanted this ‘‘junk band.’’ WiFi is now relied upon 
by millions for their primary broadband connectivity, and millions more for sec-
ondary, mobile connectivity. 
Importantly,  the  costs  of  providing  wireless  broadband  appear  to  be  signifi-
cantly lower than wired solutions, keeping costs to consumers affordable. Today, 
consumers  enjoy  wireless  broadband  services  for  as  little  as  $15  per  month— 
less  than  half  the  cost  of  most  wired  broadband  services  offered  by  telephone 
or  cable  companies.  Those  dominant  providers  also  typically  require  consumers

to  purchase  bundled  services—telephone  or  cable  service—in  order  to  receive 
broadband access, or charge much higher rates for unbundled broadband Inter-
net. 
WiFi  is  already  an  economic  generator  for  thousands  of  small  and  mid-sized 
businesses  that  provide  ‘‘hot  spots’’  in  places  where  people  gather  like  coffee-
shops,  conference  centers  and  airports.  But  companies,  communities  and  non- 
profits are also using WiFi to connect parks, neighborhoods, and even to entire 
cities and towns. NYCWireless, a New York nonprofit, provides affordable wire-
less  service  to  Bryant  Park  in  Midtown  Manhattan.  Now  it’s  working  with 
churches  and  community  groups  to  provide  service  in  Harlem  neighborhoods 
and  housing  developments.  Tribal  Digital  Village  is  a  network  of  18  tribal  vil-
lages east of San Diego. It delivers high-speed Internet service to many commu-
nity  centers  in  their  area,  and  uses  the  bandwidth  for  language  preservation 
programs. It is currently developing a web portal that meets local needs. Tribal 
youth  even  train  adults  how  to  use  the  technology,  benefiting  everyone.  The 
Alaska Marine Highway System, a project of the Department of Transportation 
uses WiFi to connect its ships to their network when they are at sea. 
WiFi  offers  great  promise  for  providing  ubiquitous  broadband  access  across  the 
nation.  This  is  particularly  important  for  rural  or  underserved  urban  markets, 
where  existing  cable  or  DSL  providers  are  not  offering  service.  But  equally  im-
portant,  wireless  providers  can  offer  an  affordable  competitive  alternative  to 
areas that have access only to a single high-priced, monopoly provider. 
But  the  growth  potential  of  this  now  $10  billion  industry  is  limited  because 
under  current  licensing  schemes,  WiFi  is  limited  to  the  unlicensed  2.4  and  5 
GHz bands—spectrum that does not allow signals to pass easily through obsta-
cles, such as trees or walls. These bands are also extremely crowed; WiFi shares 
this  spectrum  with  hundreds  of  consumer  electronic  devices.  In  order  for  wire-
less  broadband  to  become  an  option  for  more  Americans,  providers  need  access 
to  unlicensed  low-frequency  spectrum  below  1  GHz—less  crowded  spectrum 
with propagation characteristics that allow it to travel though buildings, moun-
tains, and other obstacles. 

It  is  imperative  that  the  American  public  is  able  to  better  utilize  the  two  incred-
ibly  valuable,  publicly  owned  blocks  of  spectrum,  which  today  are  under  the  near- 
exclusive  control  of  the  broadcasting  industry  at  no-cost  to  them:  the  digital  band 
below  698  MHz  which  broadcasters  will  retain;  and  the  700  MHz  band,  which  will 
be reclaimed after the transition. 

As  part  of  the  digital  transition,  Congress  must  ensure  that  both  reclaimed  and 
digital  spectrum  will  be  used  to  foster  universal  access  to  broadband  and  foster 
stronger market competition. We offer the following recommendations: 
1. Promote Improved Competition Through Spectrum Auction Policy 

If  the  merger  between  Sprint  and  Nextel  is  approved,  just  three  companies  will 
dominate  the  wireless  industry.  The  owners  of  two  of  those  wireless  companies— 
Verizon  Wireless  and  Cingular—are  near-monopoly  telephone  companies  that  also 
dominate local and long-distance calling throughout the United States. Other, small-
er wireless companies remain minor players that lack the spectrum needed to com-
pete and match services over the long-term. 

But  if  rights  to  the  valuable  spectrum  that  will  be  freed  up  by  the  transition  are 
available  only  to  the  dominant  wireless  carriers  as  smaller  players  are  priced  out 
of  the  market,  the  auctions  will  only  make  a  badly  concentrated  market  even  less 
competitive—undercutting  quality-of-service,  reducing  choices,  and  inflating  prices. 
Without  the  proper  safeguards  in  place,  Congress  virtually  ensures  the  auctioning 
of spectrum to dominant providers that already control the bulk of this concentrated 
market  and  who  will  be  unlikely  to  offer  more  affordable  wireless  Internet  services 
that compete with their wired offerings. 

Newly  available  spectrum  could  be  used  for  wireless  broadband  in  rural  and 
urban  communities.  Even  licensed  options  could  be  new  alternatives  to  the  incum-
bents  for  high-speed  Internet  access.  The  Congress  should  ensure  that  of  the  esti-
mated 60 MHz to be returned and offered at auction, adequate spectrum is set aside 
for  auction  to  new  market  entrants  and  small  existing  players.  Doing  so  will  put 
pressure  on  the  largest  market  players  to  compete,  resulting  in  lower  consumer 
prices, higher quality, and expanded choices. 
2.  Promote  Universal  Access  to  Broadband  by  Allocating  Spectrum  for  Unlicensed 

Use 

Congress  also  has  a  unique  opportunity  during  the  transition  to  use  portions  of 
the returned spectrum to grow unlicensed, or open-market, uses of spectrum. Open-

market spectrum expands the ability of ordinary citizens to use and share the public 
airwaves.  But  the  potential  to  further  expand  the  ability  of  people  to  use  their  air-
waves is constrained by relegating unlicensed use to higher-frequency ‘‘junk bands.’’ 
As  noted  above,  the  ‘‘junk  bands’’  were  given  this  moniker  precisely  because  the 
signals  that  can  be  transmitted  at  these  frequencies  are  limited—they  do  not  pass 
easily  through  walls  or  trees  like  TV  signals  do.  And  many  other  devices—like  ga-
rage door openers, microwaves, and cordless phones—use the same space. 

If  the  principle  of  sharing  the  spectrum  in  a  non-interfering  manner  is  extended 
to portions of lower frequency spectrum below 1 GHz, the potential to deliver wire-
less  broadband  and  other  communications  services  at  lower  costs  will  expand  dra-
matically.  Congress  can  and  should  expand  the  space  in  which  the  unlicensed  or 
noncommercial  use  of  the  airwaves  is  encouraged  and  allowed.  It  can  do  so  in  fol-
lowing ways: 

• First,  it  should  set  aside  a  portion  of  the  reclaimed  spectrum  to  be  dedicated 
for unlicensed use. A set-aside of 18 to 20 MHz of recovered spectrum on a na-
tionwide basis would open adequate space to promote unlicensed uses. 
• Second,  it  can  set  aside  a  small  part  of  the  digital  spectrum  for  unlicensed  use 
by  allowing  non-interfering  use  of  white  spaces,  or  through  appropriate  assign-
ment  of  new  digital  channels.  Congress  cannot  ignore  the  fact  that  the  digital 
spectrum  is  the  largest  part  of  the  spectrum  made  available  to  private  entities 
not subject to auction.4 With the windfall provided to broadcasters in the 6 MHz 
they  will  be  allowed  to  retain,  broadcasters  will  be  able  to  provide  six  or  more 
digital  channels—far  more  than  ever  anticipated  when  Congress  enacted  the 
1996 Telecommunications Act—where they previously offered one. 
Fortunately,  the  digital  spectrum  can  be  allocated  in  a  manner  that  enables 
broadcasters to offer a full slate of digital multicasts while leaving enough room 
for unlicensed wireless Internet services in these low frequency bands; 
These proposals for unlicensed use of the digital bands could be particularly ef-
fective  in  encouraging  wireless  broadband  deployment  in  rural  areas  where 
more  white  space  is  available  and  fewer  channels  are  occupied.  Under  current 
rules  and  proceedings,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  has  moved 
only haltingly to expand the non-interfering uses of the spectrum. A clear public 
policy  promoting  the  non-interfering  use  of  spectrum  would  speed  the  process 
along, and allow unlicensed sharing of spectrum to advance much more rapidly. 
The unlicensed use of even a small portion of newly available spectrum would pro-
vide  untold  public  benefits.  Among  many,  the  most  notable  is  the  opportunity  to 
support  expansion  of  community  wireless  Internet  services,  offering  perhaps  the 
first meaningful opportunity for bridging the digital divide that has confounded pol-
icymakers for more than a decade. 
Address Media Ownership 

At  a  time  when  concerns  about  competition,  cost,  and  diversity  of  programming 
have  prompted  a  revisiting  of  media  ownership  rules,  the  DTV  transition  could 
worsen the problem in local markets. Congress should not ignore the serious impli-
cations digital transmission has on media concentration. 

We  have  significant  concerns  about  the  power  provided  to  local  news  companies 
that  already  own  and  control  local  newspapers  and  radio  stations  being  provided 
with the capacity to offer six or more digital channels where they previously offered 
one. 

Though all local broadcasters will receive the same new digital capacity, they can-
not  all  take  equal  advantage  of  it.  Only  a  few  stations  in  any  market  currently 
produce  or  offer  local  news.  Those  that  do  will  gain  even  more  market  control  in 
a multicast digital environment. 

A  Consumers  Union/Consumer  Federation  of  America  study  of  station  ownership 
between 1975 and 2000, found that the number of television station owners fell from 
540  to  360,  and  the  overall  number  of  stations  rose.  But  the  number  of  TV  news-
rooms  declined  during  this  same  period.  In  fact,  only  half  of  all  broadcast  TV  sta-
tions provide news. Stations with newsrooms, particularly those affiliated with large 
news  conglomerates,  will  be  better  able  to  utilize  the  additional  digital  capacity, 
dominating local news carriage, reducing diversity of news and information, and in-
creasing  the  volume  and  impact  of  a  single  owner’s  voice  in  the  news  marketplace 
in their community. 

4 Certain parts of the spectrum have been set aside or assigned for public governmental uses, 
like defense, safety and education, and not subject to auction. The original cellular licenses were 
also given to licensees.

To address this problem, Congress should: 
• prevent  broadcasters  from  holding  two  television  licenses  in  a  community;  and 
• prevent television broadcasters from also owning a daily newspaper in the same 

market. 

In  2003,  millions  of  Americans,  a  bipartisan  coalition  from  the  House,  a  majority 
of  the  Senate,  and  leaders  from  both  parties  raised  concerns  about  media  conglom-
erates  owning  two  stations  in  most  markets,  or  three  stations  in  the  largest  ones. 
Unless Congress acts to prevent it, the digital transition has the very real potential 
to substantially increase the ability of a few broadcast giants to dominate local news 
markets nationwide. 
Serving the Public Interest 

In  exchange  for  the  privilege  of  free  and  exclusive  use  of  the  public  airwaves, 
broadcasters must serve the ‘‘public interest, convenience and necessity’’ through the 
fulfillment  of  public  interest  obligations,  such  as  the  provision  of  educational,  civic, 
political,  and  other  programming.  Among  many  shortcomings  of  these  obligations, 
however,  has  been  the  ability  of  the  broadcasters  themselves  to  define  what  con-
stitutes  programming  in  the  public  interest.  In  addition,  compliance  with  overly 
vague  obligations  is  difficult  both  to  verify  and  enforce.  In  short,  these  obligations 
have failed to serve the public. 

The  FCC  should  hold  broadcasters  accountable  for  their  public  interest  obliga-
tions,  both  now  and  after  the  DTV  transition,  preferably  through  quantifiable  and 
enforceable requirements. These are worthy goals and they should be met. However, 
given  the  historical  and  inevitable  shortcomings  of  these  obligations,  improvements 
to  the  public  interest  obligation  in  any  digital  transition  legislation  will  be  insuffi-
cient to adequately serve the public interest. 

Such  provisions  are  neither  an  effective  nor  equivalent  substitute  for  legislative 
requirements  allocating  spectrum  to  promote  market  competition  and  unlicensed 
use for requirements allocating a portion of retained spectrum for independent local 
news,  information,  or  entertainment  programming.  Setting  aside  a  portion  of  the 
airwaves  for  unlicensed,  open  use  would  expand  the  ability  of  people  to  speak  with 
electronic  voices  in  a  manner  the  promotes  free  speech  rights  more  dramatically 
than any single act Congress has taken since exclusive licenses were introduced. 

There  is  little  debate  that,  to  date,  the  imposition  of  vague  obligations  on  broad-
casters has failed the public interest. In order to meet public needs, Congress must 
address  the  critical  competitive,  diversity,  and  ownership  concentration  issues  we 
have  raised  in  our  testimony  through  the  effective,  equitable,  and  appropriate  allo-
cation of one of the most valuable publicly owned resources—radio spectrum. If Con-
gress takes these steps, it will provide far more meaningful public benefits than any 
improvement to public interest obligations can offer. 
Summary 

Consumers  will  not  thank  Congress  for  digital  television  if  it  also  means  they 
have  Congress  to  thank  for  the  cost  of  inconvenience,  of  paying  for  converter  boxes 
out of their own pockets, or the higher prices of new TVs, computers, or equipment 
to  integrate  their  home  entertainment  systems.  The  enormous  costs  of  the  digital 
transition should be paid for by the ample proceeds generated by the auction of re-
claimed spectrum, and by the many industry players that will profit from this tran-
sition. 

Digital  television  is  a  positive  technology  that  has  the  potential  to  benefit  con-
sumers  and  the  public  as  a  whole.  But  that  potential  can  only  be  realized  through 
the  appropriate  spectrum  policies  adopted  as  part  of  the  transition  that  promote 
competition and innovation in the telecommunications market that will lower prices, 
improve service, and expand choices for consumers. 

We look forward to working with the Committee in stimulating a rapid transition 
to  digital  television  broadcasting  and  to  craft  legislation  that  will  resolve  these  im-
portant issues for both consumers and affected industries.

STATEMENT OF GARY J. SHAPIRO, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ASSOCIATION (CEA) 

Mr. SHAPIRO. The Consumer Electronics Association is a national 
trade  association  of  some  2,000  technology  companies.  Many  of 
your  colleagues  have  seen  us  best  at  the  International  Consumer 
Electronics  Show  in  Las  Vegas,  Nevada,  the  world’s  largest  tech-
nology  show—in  the  world’s  best  trade-show  location,  too,  I  might 
add. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  SHAPIRO.  These  are  the  PC-makers,  the  digital  television, 
cellular  telephone—these  are  the  companies  that  have  driven  the 
economy, driven technology. We also have retailers as members, as 
well,  and  these  are  the  companies  which  are  bringing  the  future. 

The CHAIRMAN. Are these manufacturers? 
Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Manufacturers,  retailers  and  integrators,  distribu-
tors.  Mostly  manufacturers,  overwhelmingly.  The  large  and  small 
mom-and-pop manufacturers all over the country—— 

The CHAIRMAN. Any TV manufacturers—— 
Mr. SHAPIRO. Almost every TV-maker. To be a member, you must 
be  a  U.S.  company  with  U.S.  presence  of  some  type.  You  might 
be—a  few  of  them  are  overseas-headquartered,  but  they  have  U.S. 
facilities.  But,  overwhelmingly,  they  are  U.S.-owned-and-operated 
companies. 

The CHAIRMAN. But do they manufacture here? 
Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Yes.  We  have—we  employ,  in  the  consumer  elec-
tronics  industry,  probably  almost  two  million  people  indirectly,  di-
rectly, several hundred thousand. 
The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you. 
Mr.  SHAPIRO.  It’s  a  much  larger  industry  than  broadcasting,  ac-

tually. 

ogy. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Start the clock. Thank you. My apol-

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Stevens. 
Thank  you,  Co-Chairman  Inouye  and  members  of  the  Committee. 
We support, as a trade association, our 2,000 member companies, 
a  hard  deadline  to  the  end  of  analog  broadcasting.  That  will  bring 
the certainty we will need. It’ll be a win-win situation for all stake-
holders.  It’ll  allow  manufacturers  and  retailers  to  label  analog 
products.  And,  of  course,  it  will  foster  innovation.  And,  as  we 
heard, it will strengthen our national security. 

Now,  thanks  to  great  products,  great  content,  intense  competi-
tion,  and,  quite  frankly,  falling  prices,  digital  television  sales  are 
setting  records  virtually  every  quarter.  If  Congress  sets  a  hard 
deadline, we expect to have sold 97 million digital television tuners 
by 2009, and we estimate that, by that date, we’ll have digital tele-
vision tuners in 86 percent of American homes. 

Of  course,  the  digital  television  is  succeeding,  the  transition  is 
succeeding,  because  consumers  are  learning  about  digital  tele-
vision.  We’ve  run  some  award-winning  promotional  efforts.  We’ve 
done  lots  of  things  to  inform  consumers  about  this  great  product. 
But we support the consensus on a late-2008 hard cut-off date. And 
with a hard deadline, stations will know what to broadcast, manu-
facturers  and  retailers  will  know  what  to  make  and  to  stock,  and 
consumers  will  know  what  to  buy.  The  stakes  are  very  high  here.

And,  of  course,  we  recognize  the  concerns  that  Mr.  Kimmelman 
expressed, about disenfranchising consumers. But, indeed, the data 
shows  that  the  number  of  consumers  in  the  category  has  been 
somewhat exaggerated. 

If  there’s  any  doubt  about  this,  consider  the  total  lack  of  outcry 
when  it  was  announced  that  NFL  Monday  Night  Football  will  not 
be  broadcast  free  over-the-air;  in  the  future,  it  will  only  be  cable 
or satellite. No articles were written. No consumer complaints were 
received. Indeed, nearly 87 percent of American TV homes now re-
ceive  their  broadcast  programming  via  cable  or  satellite.  Further-
more,  only  37.7  million  of  the  285  million  television  sets  used  in 
the U.S. are used to view over-the-air programming. That’s only 11 
and  a  half  percent  of  the  TV  sets  are  even  using  an  antenna  now 
to  get  over-the-air  programming.  This  means  that  if  analog  ceased 
tomorrow,  less  than  13  percent  of  the  population  would  not  have 
access to a broadcast signal. 

And,  in  those  homes  that  do  have  cable  or  satellite,  we’ve  asked 
them, we’ve surveyed them. What did we find? Only 14 percent use 
an  antenna  on  their  second,  third,  or  fourth  television.  And,  of 
course, as we proceed toward the deadline, cable and satellite pene-
tration will go up, and these numbers will diminish, in terms of the 
impact. 

But  what  about  the  people  that  don’t  subscribe  to  cable  or  sat-
ellite?  Our  research  shows  that  this  population’s  decision  not  to 
subscribe  to  cable  or  satellite  is  not  made,  generally,  for  economic 
reasons.  These  are  people  for  whom  television  is  not  a  high  pri-
ority. And three-quarters of these analog-only homes are willing to 
buy a new TV, buy a $50 decoder, or subscribe to cable or satellite. 
Some consumers will be affected by a hard date, and that’s why we 
understand your interest in creating a program to allow consumers 
to have access to low-cost digital-to-analog converters. 

The  simple  fact  is  that,  while  an  analog  broadcasting  cutoff  is 
important for our Nation, it will only have a small practical impact 
on  the  viewing  habits  of  vast  majority  of  Americans.  And,  for  this 
reason,  we  commend  you  for  your  suggestion  that  analog  broad-
casting end by January 1, 2009. 

Now, our primary goal, of course, is to make the DTV transition 
as  consumer-friendly  as  possible,  and  that’s  why  we  support  the 
hard cutoff date. But we are concerned about some proposals to ac-
celerate  the  digital  deadlines  in  a  way  that  will  harm  consumers 
and  create  significant  disruptions  at  retail.  This  would  be  unfortu-
nate. Actually, government set these dates. The manufacturing and 
retail community relied upon these dates. And now we’re being told 
that perhaps they should be accelerated aggressively for the 13- to 
24-inch  category,  which  is  the  lower-cost  televisions.  That  would 
have an enormous impact on television reception devices. These are 
VCRs,  DVDs,  and  digital  video  recorders.  And  it  would  dramati-
cally  increase—perhaps  even  double—the  price  of  most  affordable 
small-screen TV sets, or force manufacturers to now produce those 
models, rather than be in noncompliance. This would be an impact 
that  consumers  would  see  from  this  DTV  transition.  They’ll  walk 
in  their  store,  and  the  lowest-priced  TV  sets  have,  all  of  a  sudden, 
doubled in cost.

We  urge  the  Committee  to  also  address  the  important  issue  of 
signal degradation if the signal comes in through cable. And we en-
sure  that  the  digital  signal  be  carried  under  all  circumstances. 
Where cable operators are carrying broadcast signals digitally, they 
should  not  be  allowed  to  reduce  the  quality  of  the  signal,  or  the 
sound  quality,  or  eliminate  program-related  material.  If  a  broad-
caster is actually providing a full HDTV signal in Dolby digital sur-
round-sound,  then  that  is  what  HDTV  owners  who  subscribe  to 
cable should see and hear. 

Of  course,  we  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  bring  about 
this  glorious  DTV  transition  to  a  successful  and  timely  conclusion. 
Meanwhile,  we’ll  continue  our  unprecedented  efforts  to  educate 
consumers  about  digital  television.  And  I,  personally,  pledge  our 
CEA  support  and  commitment  working  with  you  and  other  stake-
holders,  to  ensure  a  speedy  and  consumer-friendly  transition  and 
a prompt return of the analog broadcast spectrum. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Shapiro follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARY J. SHAPIRO, PRESIDENT/CEO, 

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ASSOCIATION (CEA) 

Chairman Stevens, Co-Chairman Inouye and members of the Committee: 
Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  discuss  our  Nation’s  progress  in  the  transition  to 
digital  television  (DTV),  and  the  steps  that  should  be  taken  to  conclude  the  transi-
tion in the most beneficial and understandable manner. 

I  represent  the  Consumer  Electronics  Association  (CEA),  the  principal  U.S.  trade 
association of the consumer electronics and information technology industries. CEA’s 
2,000  members  include  virtually  every  DTV  manufacturer.  Our  members  invented 
DTV,  and  we  are  thrilled  by  its  astounding  marketplace  success.  CEA  also  rep-
resents  the  cutting-edge  information  technology  companies  who  will  use  the  recov-
ered analog broadcast spectrum to provide all Americans with innovative new wire-
less products and services. 

CEA  strongly  supports  the  enactment  of  a  hard  deadline  for  the  end  of  analog 
broadcasting. A hard deadline will bring certainty to the DTV transition. It will pro-
vide  a  ‘‘win-win’’  scenario  for  all  stakeholders,  while  fostering  innovation  and 
strengthening  homeland  security  and  public  safety.  We  urge  you  to  include  a  hard 
analog cutoff date in any DTV legislation this committee considers. 
DTV Sales Continue to Rapidly Increase 

Our  most  recent  sales  figures  show  that  the  first  4  months  of  2005  brought  the 
greatest volume of DTV sales ever recorded, with 3 million DTV products accounting 
for $4.7 billion of consumer investment and contribution to the robust U.S. economy. 
This  is  a  remarkable  45  percent  increase  in  unit  sales  from  the  same  time  period 
in 2004. 

More than 17 million DTV products have been sold since the first HDTV sets hit 
the  market  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1998.  Americans  already  have  invested  an  as-
tonishing $25 billion in DTV products. HDTV is the driver behind these phenomenal 
sales  figures,  with  high-definition  displays  and  receivers  representing  85  percent  of 
the DTV products sold to date. 

Sales are being driven by the rapid price declines that are typical of our industry. 
DTV prices are 75 percent lower than they were 5 years ago and are still declining 
by  approximately  15  percent  each  year.  Today  there  are  numerous  DTV  options 
under  the  $700  mark,  and  even  some  expected  soon  for  as  low  as  $400.  Over  the 
next  2  years,  our  members  plan  to  introduce  $60  digital-to-analog  converters  that 
will allow analog TVs to receive digital TV broadcasts. 

Meanwhile,  DTV  products  have  spread  from  specialty  retailers  and  major  con-
sumer  electronics  chains  into  warehouse  clubs,  mass  merchants,  and  now  discount 
stores like Wal-Mart and Target. 

When consumers walk into retail stores, they now enjoy an unprecedented variety 
of  DTV  products  to  meet  their  needs  and  budgets.  Buyers  can  choose  from  a  vast 
array  of  compelling  displays  from  traditional  CRT  sets  to  cutting-edge  new  tech-
nologies like plasma, LCD, DLP, and LCoS.

Most  important  to  the  current  debate  is  the  fact  that  consumers  now  can  choose 

from 200+ ‘‘integrated’’ models that include over-the-air ATSC tuners. 

To put this in perspective, digital television has been adopted twice as quickly as 
color television. While it took color television 10 years to achieve 5 percent penetra-
tion  from  introduction,  digital  television  products  are  already  in  16  million  Amer-
ican homes. 

Indeed, overall revenues from digital TV now outpace those from analog TV. Tele-

vision manufacturing is now a digital industry. 

As  impressive  as  those  numbers  sound,  we  are  only  beginning  to  move  up  the 
‘‘hockey  stick  curve’’  of  sales,  especially  with  respect  to  integrated  DTV  sets 
equipped with digital over-the-air (ATSC) tuners. CEA forecasts that 9 million inte-
grated  DTVs  will  be  sold  this  year,  16.7  million  in  2006,  27  million  in  2007,  and 
33 million in 2008. 

Including  set-top  boxes,  by  2009,  we  will  have  sold  97  million  DTV  tuners,  and 
we estimate that over-the-air tuners will be found in 86 percent of American homes. 
At the same time, sales of analog sets are declining precipitously. We project sales 

to decline 36 percent in 2006, and an additional 53 percent in 2007. 
CEA Is the Leader in DTV Consumer Education 

The  CE  industry  has  every  business  incentive  to  educate  consumers  about  the 
qualities  and  features  of  the  DTV  they  want  to  purchase.  That  is  why  CEA  runs 
an  extraordinary  educational  effort  to  ensure  that  consumers  are  fully  informed 
about their DTV options. 

Just  last  month,  the  National  Association  of  Consumer  Agency  Administrators 
(NACAA)  presented  CEA  and  the  FCC  with  the  prestigious  Achievement  in  Con-
sumer Education Award for our joint efforts in informing consumers about the tran-
sition  to  DTV,  and  helping  consumers  make  the  digital  choices  that  are  right  for 
them.  We  are  committed  to  continuing  our  educational  efforts  with  the  FCC,  and 
invite  all  interested  parties  to  join  in  our  campaign  to  inform  Americans  about  the 
digital transition. 

As the primary conduit to consumers, it is critical that retail floor staff is properly 

equipped to provide accurate and easy-to-understand information. 

CEA  aggressively  responded  to  this  challenge  and  created  a  comprehensive  DTV 
retailer-training  program  called  CEKnowHow 
(it  can  be  viewed  online  at 
www.ceknowhow.com).  This  program  is  available  to  all  retailers  over  the  Internet. 
It equips them with the most up-to-date online training for sales associates, so that 
they can effectively respond to consumer inquiries on DTV and HDTV. 

CEA also designed, printed, and made available to retailers a ‘‘tip sheet’’ that ex-
plains  the  DTV  transition  and  basic  DTV  terms  and  technology.  In  late  2004,  CEA 
partnered  with  the  FCC  and  the  Consumer  Electronics  Retailers  Coalition  (CERC) 
to  distribute  more  than  750,000  copies  of  the  tip  sheet  to  consumers,  retailers,  and 
professional home theater installers. 

More  recently,  the  Consumer  Electronics  Retailers  Coalition  (CERC)  issued  its 
own  retail  consumer  guide,  ‘‘What  you  need  to  know  about  the  ‘DTV  Transition’’— 
A Dozen Questions & Answers,’ that focuses on the choices that consumers will have 
when analog broadcasting ends. This is available at www.ceretailers.org. 

Over  the  last  year,  CEA  also  visited  with  major  consumer  electronics  buying 
groups  and  talked  to  more  than  2,000  dealers  to  bring  them  the  latest  information 
on the DTV transition. We have collaborated with Comcast on an educational DVD 
that  covers  DTV  information  ranging  from  basic  definitions  to  the  equipment  re-
quired  to  receive  and  view  HDTV  content  via  antenna,  satellite  or  cable  delivery. 
CEA  also  is  making  every  effort  to  reach  out  directly  to  consumers.  Millions  of 
readers across the country saw our inserts in TV Guide and Sports Illustrated mag-
azines  explaining  the  basics  of  DTV,  how  to  get  a  signal,  what  product  choices  are 
available,  and  so  on.  We  also  have  showcased  HDTV  before  hundreds  of  thousands 
of  consumers  through  exhibits  at  home  design  shows,  and  trade  exhibitions,  and 
viewing parties in public venues across the Nation. 

CEA exposes millions of consumers to HDTV through our nationally pre-packaged 
video and news releases, as well as our national CEA media tour. And our quarterly 
HDTV Guide is the single most authoritative list of the DTV products and program-
ming currently available. 

Meanwhile,  CEA  has  taken  the  lead  in  promoting  consumer  awareness  and  use 
of  over-the-air  digital  television  reception.  Through  our  AntennaWeb  program,  con-
sumers  can  visit  a  website  (www.antennaweb.org),  enter  their  home  address,  and 
find  the  optimal  outdoor  television  antenna  for  their  specific  location.  This  site  re-
ceives approximately 100,000 hits per month. 

We  also  see  it  as  our  obligation  to  recognize  those  who  are  going  above  and  be-
yond  the  call  of  duty  in  furthering  the  DTV  transition.  Every  year,  our  Academy

of  DTV  Pioneers  honors  the  best  of  the  best  in  HDTV  programming,  reporting  and 
retailing. And, as it should be, every year the categories get more crowded and com-
petitive. 

This  is  just  a  sampling  of  CEA’s  strong  commitment  to  educating  consumers  and 

retailers about the DTV transition. 

In  short,  for  the  DTV  transition,  everything  is  moving  rapidly  in  the  right  direc-
tion.  Product  sales  continue  to  rise,  as  prices  decline.  The  amount  and  variety  of 
HDTV  programming  continues  to  increase.  Content  delivery  industries  are  increas-
ingly  jumping  onto  the  HD  bandwagon.  Exciting  new  products  are  rolling  into  the 
marketplace.  Consumer  and  retailer  education  is  advancing.  By  almost  any  meas-
ure, digital television is a marketplace success. 

Now is the appropriate time to take the next step and bring the broadcast digital 
transition to a successful conclusion, just as envisioned by this Committee when the 
Congress  loaned  public  spectrum  to  the  broadcasters  for  the  DTV  transition  a  dec-
ade ago. 
The Time for a Hard Deadline Is Now 

The 700 MHz band currently occupied by analog broadcasters is beachfront prop-
erty on the spectrum landscape. The prompt recovery of this spectrum by Congress 
will  produce  immense  public  interest  and  economic  benefits  while  fostering  innova-
tion and protecting our national security. 

First, the analog TV broadcast spectrum is ideal for advanced wireless broadband 
applications. A hard date will spur innovators to develop a broad range of new wire-
less technologies and services. These new wireless services will offer unprecedented 
access  to  rural  and  underserved  areas,  while  creating  competition  that  will  drive 
down prices for all wireless consumers. 

A hard date also will fundamentally change and accelerate the DTV marketplace. 
With the certainty of a hard deadline, stations will know what to broadcast, manu-
facturers will know what to make, retailers will know what to stock, and consumers 
will  know  what  to  buy.  With  the  completion  of  the  digital  transition  now  an  immi-
nent reality, all affected industries will shift our consumer education efforts into an 
even higher gear. 

But  the  rationale  for  a  hard  date  goes  deeper  than  promoting  new  technologies 
and  broadband  access.  As  reinforced  by  recent  evacuation  of  the  White  House  and 
this  Capitol,  the  gravest  threat  to  our  safety  is  another  national  calamity  like  we 
suffered  on  September  11,  2001.  It  is  now  more  apparent  than  ever  the  700  MHz 
band  held  by  broadcasters  is  essential  to  the  swift  and  effective  response  of  Home-
land Security, police, firefighters, and other first responders. 

That  is  why  the  Association  of  Public  Safety  Communications  Officials  has  im-
plored  you  to  set  an  analog  broadcasting  cutoff  date,  stating  that  ‘‘the  security  of 
our  homeland  and  the  lives  and  property  of  our  citizens  as  well  as  our  responders 
are at stake.’’ 

The  key  to  unleashing  these  benefits  is  for  a  hard  date  to  be  set,  and  set  now. 
The Vast Majority of Americans Now Choose Cable or Satellite To Provide 

Their Television Programming 

Americans  now  have  more  ways  to  receive  video  programming  than  ever  before. 
The  vast  majority  of  Americans  receive  local  and  network  broadcast  signals  via 
cable and satellite (and will soon have these services available via telephone, mobile, 
and wireless broadband). Meanwhile, the statistics show that a small and declining 
number  of  households  now  rely  exclusively  on  a  free  over-the-air  broadcast  signal, 
and a minimal number of TV sets are actually used to watch broadcast TV. 

If  there  is  any  doubt  about  this,  consider  the  total  lack  of  public  outcry  over  the 
recent  announcement  that  Monday  Night  Football,  a  long  staple  of  broadcast  TV, 
will soon be available only to satellite and cable households. 

Indeed, our research shows that only 32.7 million (or 11.5 percent) of the 285 mil-
lion television sets used in the United States are used to view over-the-air television 
programming. 

This phenomenon is driven by the fact that television today is largely a wired (i.e., 
cable  or  satellite)  service.  Of  the  nearly  110  million  American  homes  with  at  least 
one TV, 60 percent receive a cable signal, and 24 percent receive a DBS signal. Our 
research  shows  that  roughly  2  percent  receive  both  cable  and  DBS,  while  another 
2 percent of homes use their sets exclusively with VCRs, DVD players, or videogame 
systems and do not use their sets with over-the-air or subscription services. 

In  total,  approximately  86  percent  of  American  homes  get  their  TV  signal  from 
cable  or  satellite  (and  thus  network  and  local  broadcast  feeds).  This  means  that  if 
the analog cutoff occurred today, approximately 12 percent of the population of 110

104 

million  TV  households  would  not  have  access  to  a  broadcast  signal  through  cable 
or satellite. 

And  this  number  is  shrinking  every  year.  Cable  and  satellite  penetration  con-
tinues to grow by about one to 2 percentage points annually. What’s more, the mar-
ket research firm Sanford Bernstein has just concluded that cable and satellite sub-
scribers are growing 3.6 percent annually. 

With only 32.7 million sets used to view over-the-air television, it is clear that the 
vast majority of TVs in the U.S. are not used for this purpose. The number of over- 
the-air  homes  will  decline  even  further  as  more  and  more  Americans  pay  to  sub-
scribe  to  TV  services,  including  new  technologies  such  as  Internet-Protocol  TV,  and 
television via telephony, and over powerlines. Additionally, growing broadband pen-
etration will continue to change how Americans receive their programming. In fact, 
broadcasters are increasingly providing their content through other means including 
the  Internet  and  mobile  phones.  Just  recently,  Verizon  announced  a  deal  where  it 
would provide NBC’s feed over its fiber network. 

With  respect  to  consumers  with  neither  cable  nor  satellite,  our  research  shows 
that  this  population’s  decision  not  to  subscribe  generally  is  not  driven  by  economic 
reasons. Indeed, our data shows that 68 percent choose not to subscribe for a reason 
other  than  cost—with  almost  a  third  reporting  that  they  do  not  subscribe  because 
they ‘‘don’t watch that much TV.’’ 

Those who do not subscribe to cable or satellite watch on average 30 percent less 
television  per  week  than  cable  and  satellite  subscribers.  Nearly  six  of  ten  say  tele-
vision simply is not a high priority for them. Fewer than three in ten indicate that 
insufficient funds play a role in their decisions not to subscribe to cable or satellite 
television. 

I should note that this population of over-the-air households does not eschew tech-
nology.  Seventy-nine  percent  of  antenna-only  households  own  a  home  radio;  sixty 
percent  own  a  cell  phone  and  desktop  or  laptop  PC;  and  forty-eight  percent  have 
some type of dial-up or broadband Internet connection. 

Some  opponents  of  a  hard  deadline  raise  concerns  about  the  unconnected  analog 
TV  sets  in  households  that  subscribe  to  satellite  or  cable  TV,  and  claim  that  most 
of  these  sets  are  used  with  antennas  for  watching  over-the-air  analog  signals.  In 
fact, primary viewing most often occurs on the TV that is connected to pay services. 
Of  the  173.3  million  sets  in  cable  homes,  only  4.4  million  are  used  to  receive  over- 
the-air broadcasts. More often, the unconnected TVs are shunted to a less used room 
and hooked up with a DVD player, VCR, or video game. Indeed, our research shows 
these  sets  are  used  at  least  half  the  time  for  one  of  these  many  alternate  uses.  In 
addition,  as  many  cable  companies  no  longer  have  a  monthly  charge  for  additional 
outlets, this issue has become increasingly irrelevant for cable homes. 

In  households  utilizing  an  antenna,  TVs  connected  to  the  antenna  are  often  pri-
marily  used  for  an  activity  other  than  watching  broadcast  television.  Of  the  25.9 
million  sets  in  exclusively  over-the-air  homes,  3.4  million  are  used  exclusively  for 
watching  pre-recorded  content,  playing  video  games,  and  other  non-broadcast  uses. 
Further, in these households, the TV connected to an antenna is used approximately 
40 percent of the time with DVD players, VCRs, and videogame systems. 

Our research indicates that three-quarters of antenna-only households are willing 
to  take  some  sort  of  voluntary  action  to  ensure  that  they  continue  to  receive  tele-
vision programming when analog broadcasts end. Twenty-two percent indicated that 
they would buy a new TV capable of receiving DTV signals; forty-two percent would 
buy  a  $60  set-top  converter;  9  percent  would  start  subscribing  to  cable  or  satellite; 
and  22  percent  would  do  nothing  since  the  TV  isn’t  used  to  watch  over-the-air 
broadcasts. 

At  the  same  time,  we  must  acknowledge  that  some  consumers  may  be  adversely 
impacted  by  a  hard  date.  That’s  why  we  respect  and  understand  the  interest  of 
some policymakers in creating a program whereby those viewers would have access 
to low-cost digital-to-analog converters. In the past, our members have testified that, 
with  economies  of  scale,  converter  prices  will  be  in  the  $60  range  by  the  time  of 
the  proposed  cut-off  date.  One  extremely  serious  development  that  will  interfere 
with this projection would be the imposition of state or national energy usage man-
dates  on  converters,  which  would  adversely  impact  converter  price  and  availability. 
By  the  time  of  a  year-end  2008  cut-off—combining  present  adoption  trends  for 
cable and satellite, and forecasts for uptake of recently announced TV services from 
telcos  like  Verizon  and  SBC,  as  well  as  the  jump  in  purchases  likely  to  occur  with 
a  hard  cutoff  date—the  number  of  American  homes  that  would  lose  their  primary 
video signal will likely would be closer to 6.8 percent. 

We  are  aware  that  certain  other  surveys  purport  to  show  a  much  higher  level  of 
reliance  on  over-the-air  broadcasting.  However,  CEA  stands  firmly  by  our  survey 
and  data  results.  We  are  extremely  proud  of  our  long-standing  dedication  to  pro-

viding  accurate  and  sound  information  to  policymakers,  the  technology  industry, 
and the financial community. 

Compared  to  other  surveys,  our  data  is  extremely  comprehensive.  To  our  knowl-
edge,  CEA’s  new  research  is  the  only  survey  that  asks  about  the  specific  usage  of 
each and every individual set in a household. Unlike other surveys, we also limited 
our  survey  to  TVs  in  the  household  that  had  been  turned  on  within  the  prior  3 
months,  thereby  allowing  us  to  have  an  accurate,  real  world  analysis  of  TVs  that 
are actually in use. 

The  accuracy  of  the  various  survey  methodologies  and  results  are  important  be-
cause  they  indicate  the  potential  cost  of  proposed  programs  to  minimize  the  viewer 
impact  of  the  analog  cutoff.  We  are  glad  to  provide  CEA’s  complete  survey  docu-
ments and offer to further analyze the data in any way that assists Congress in de-
veloping proposals to minimize viewer impact. 

The  simple  fact  is  that,  while  an  analog  broadcasting  cut-off  is  important  for  our 
nation,  it  will  have  no  impact  on  the  viewing  habits  of  the  vast  majority  of  Ameri-
cans.  We  believe  the  types  of  education  and  public  awareness  steps  that  have  been 
discussed  with  your  colleagues  can  effectively  address  the  needs  of  those  who  wish 
to rely only on broadcast television. 
CEA  Endorses  a  Hard  Deadline,  and  Offers  Suggestions  To  Bring  About  a 

More Expeditious Transition 

In  the  United  States,  the  transition  to  digital  television  has  always  been  envi-
sioned  as  having  two  purposes.  The  first  was  to  bring  the  wonders  of  digital  TV, 
and  especially  high-definition  TV  to  American  consumers.  The  second  was  to  cap-
ture the public interest and economic benefits of the return of the analog spectrum. 
We  are  now  well  on  our  way  toward  accomplishing  the  first  objective,  and  it  is 

appropriate that we turn our attention to the second. 

CEA  unequivocally  endorses  the  establishment  of  January  1,  2009,  for  the  recov-
ery  of  the  analog  spectrum.  The  setting  of  a  date  certain  will  benefit  consumers  as 
spectrum  is  reallocated  for  purposes  ranging  from  public  safety  communications  to 
exciting new services such as wireless networking and Internet access. 

CEA offers a number of suggestions that will help this Committee craft legislation 
to  hasten  the  digital  transition,  while  ensuring  the  most  expeditious,  practical,  and 
consumer friendly result. 

Specifically, we recommend the following: 
1. Tuner Mandate Acceleration: A current FCC proceeding seeks comment regard-
ing  the  acceleration  from  July  1,  2007,  to  no  later  than  December  31,  2006,  of  the 
requirement  for  manufacturers  to  include  over-the-air  tuners  in  13  to  24  inch  sets 
and other TV reception devices (such as VCRs, DVDs and DVRs). 

In  terms  of  any  proposals  to  accelerate  the  tuner  mandate  requirements,  we  are 
concerned  that  any  proposed  changes  in  the  existing  requirements  would  severely 
reduce the retail market for these products. 

Manufacturers  need  a  minimum  of  18  to  24  months  to  plan,  develop,  and  deploy 
new equipment. An accelerated tuner mandate could force some manufacturers who 
determine  that  meeting  the  new  regulations  are  not  feasible  (and  fear  inability  to 
comply  with  the  FCC’s  regulations)  to  move  to  tunerless  sets  or  to  stop  manufac-
turing  altogether  the  small-screen  TV  models  which  cannot  be  fitted  with  digital 
tuners—which many manufacturers are reluctant to do, and which would defeat the 
purpose of the tuner mandate itself. 

Even  if  manufacturers  were  able  to  meet  a  foreshortened  production  schedule,  a 
date  any  earlier  than  March  2007,  could  result  in  cost  increases  that  the  market-
place  cannot  sustain.  Of  course,  this  assumes  that  legislation  would  be  enacted  in 
September 2005, to ensure an 18-month manufacturing schedule that would enable 
manufacturers to meet a March 2007, date. Some of our members believe that accel-
erating  the  tuner  deadline  for  13  to  24  inch  sets  and  other  TV  reception  devices  to 
any  earlier  than  March  2007,  would  double  the  development  costs  for  manufactur-
ers,  as  well  as  double  the  price  of  a  typical  13  inch  television  to  consumers.  Retail-
ers  have  pointed  out  that  their  customers  buy  TVs  in  this  product  category  often 
out  of  necessity;  many  buy  a  $69  TV  on  a  layaway  plan.  If  the  product  is  rejected 
by lower income and other consumers because the price exceeds their budget, it will 
not  be  carried  by  retailers  and,  eventually,  not  produced  by  manufacturers.  This 
helps  neither  broadcasters,  consumers,  nor  the  transition,  and  irrespective  of  any 
later subsidy plan, places the burdens of the transition on those who can least afford 
it. 

The  FCC  and  the  Congress  have  consistently  recognized  the  18-month  manufac-
turing  cycle  when  they  have  imposed  requirements  on  TV  set  manufacturers.  The 
V-chip and closed captioning regulations are key examples.

The  unfortunate  result  of  an  overly-aggressive  acceleration  of  the  tuner  mandate 
deadlines would be to decrease the number of DTV tuners in the marketplace, which 
clearly does not serve the transition. 

We  recognize  there  is  a  growing  consensus  that  some  acceleration  of  the  FCC’s 
present July 1, 2007 deadline is desirable. While manufacturers have relied in good 
faith  on  the  existing  July  2007  date,  CEA  believes  that  March  2007  is  the  earliest 
possible date, consistent with the manufacturing and retail placement cycle, for the 
integration of digital reception capability into 13″ to 24″ sets and other devices hav-
ing  an  analog  tuner.  Any  deadline  prior  to  March  2007  will  only  result  in  the  ab-
sence  of  smaller  TVs  and  other  products  from  the  marketplace  as  they  are  pulled 
from distribution in advance of the deadline. 

A March 2007 date allows time for economies of scale to develop. This will lessen 
the  ‘‘sticker  shock’’  for  consumers,  allowing  these  products  a  chance  to  compete 
against  less  expensive,  tuner-less  alternatives.  Indeed  S.  1268  (the  SAVE  LIVES 
Act) sponsored by Senators McCain and Lieberman, proposes a March 1, 2007 date 
in order to minimize market disruption and consumer harm. 

2. Digital Carriage and Non-Degradation: We urge the Committee to address the 
important  issue  of  signal  degradation,  and  ensure  that  a  digital  signal  is  carried 
under  all  circumstances.  It  is  fundamental  that  when  cable  operators  are  carrying 
broadcast  signals  digitally,  they  should  not  be  allowed  to  reduce  the  sound  or  pic-
ture quality, or alter or eliminate program related data. American households—most 
of  whom  are  cable  customers—have  invested  more  than  $25  billion  dollars  in  high- 
definition  televisions.  If  a  broadcaster  is  providing  HDTV  programming  and  Dolby 
Digital  surround  sound,  then  that  is  what  HDTV  owners  who  subscribe  to  cable 
should see and hear. 

3.  Television  Labeling:  CEA  fully  supports  educational  labels  in  connection  with 
analog  televisions  when  paired  with  the  certainty  of  a  hard  date.  However,  manu-
facturers will need 120 to 180 days to include the labels on the product itself to in-
corporate  this  extra  step  into  the  manufacturing  cycle.  A  period  of  90  days  would 
be required if the label is designed as a sticker placed on the outside of the product 
packaging.  Any  shorter  notice  would  mean  that  highly  automated  production  lines 
would  have  to  be  stopped  and  re-organized  at  great  cost,  or  else  the  labels  would 
have to be added manually at similarly great cost. Conversely, with enough advance 
notice to automate the labeling process, labeling is of course a much less significant 
cost. 

Retailers also have accepted an obligation, once a hard date is set, to display con-
sumer  advisory  labels  in  the  vicinity  of  sets  with  only  analog  tuners  and  in  their 
web-based  marketing—in  each  case  with  some  variations  according  to  the  store  ar-
rangement  and  means  of  display.  Additionally,  they  have  indicated  that  they  plan 
to  assist  their  customers  with  supplemental  materials  and  to  propose  options  to 
their customers targeted to the customer’s specific needs. In order to prevent screen 
damage  upon  removal  by  a  consumer  or  retailer,  consideration  should  be  given  re-
garding  the  necessity  of  placing  the  label  ‘‘on-the-screen’’  so  long  as  it  is  attached 
to the product as shipped. 

CEA urges that any label language should be concise—otherwise, consumers may 
not  read  or  understand  it.  CEA  and  the  Consumer  Electronics  Retailers  Coalition 
recommends the following language: 

‘‘This  TV  has  only  an  ‘analog’  broadcast  tuner  so  will  require  a  converter  box 
after  [date]  to  receive  over-the-air  broadcasts  with  an  antenna,  because  of  the 
transition  to  digital  broadcasting  on  that  date.  (It  will  continue  to  work  as  be-
fore with cable and satellite TV systems, gaming consoles, VCRs, DVD players, 
and similar products.)’’ 

We  suggest  that  the  FCC  be  tasked  to  work  with  industry  and  consumers  to  de-
velop  an  appropriate  label  along  these  lines,  as  proposed  in  S.  1268,  the  SAVE 
LIVES bill. 

4.  Channel  Allotments:  CEA  supports  a  timetable  of  December  31,  2006,  as  the 
final  date  for  the  FCC  to  issue  final  broadcaster  channel  allotments,  and  an  addi-
tional  7  months  to  conclude  any  reconsideration  of  such  allotments.  We  urge  the 
Committee not to extend the reconsideration period beyond 7 months, as this could 
cause the final end-date for analog broadcasting to slip to 2010. 

5.  Broadcaster  Disclosures:  In  light  of  our  own  aggressive  consumer  education  ef-
forts,  CEA  has  been  disappointed  with  the  paltry  level  of  DTV  consumer  education 
offered  by  the  broadcasters  to  date,  especially  the  almost  complete  lack  of  broad-
caster-sponsored  public  service  announcements  (PSAs).  We  urge  the  Committee  to 
address  this  issue,  and  we  urge  that  any  legislation  require  increased  broadcaster- 
consumer  education  activities.  Specifically,  the  Committee  should  consider  starting 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

107 

the  required  announcements  at  least  1  year  before  analog  shut-off,  and  increasing 
the number of ads from two per day—at least in months closest to the analog shut- 
off—and  imposing  separate  educational  requirements  on  networks,  as  well  as  local 
broadcasters. This makes sense because broadcasters are the ones with a vested in-
terest in transitioning the remaining over-the-air viewers to digital. Broadcasting is 
a powerful and effective communications medium, and it is essential that the broad-
casters themselves step up and do their part to educate the Nation about the transi-
tion to digital television. 

6.  Broadcaster  Compliance:  Ensure  that  broadcasters  comply  with  Federal  Com-
munications  Commission  maximization/replication  requirements.  As  of  today,  more 
than 100 stations have requested a waiver and extension of the FCC’s July 1, 2005 
requirement  for  maximization  and  replication  for  stations  affiliated  with  a  top-four 
network  and  located  in  the  top-100  markets.  Broadcasters  must  comply  with  FCC 
rules  to  ensure  a  successful  and  rapid  transition.  Despite  the  broadcasters’  words 
about  the  importance  of  the  DTV  transition  and  all  they  have  expended  to  convert 
to  digital,  the  real  test  is  what  they  are  doing.  They  are  seeking  extensions  and 
waivers today, just as they have been doing for the last 5 years. Only a hard shut- 
off  date  enacted  into  law  will  make  them  realize  that  the  DTV  conversion  is  inevi-
table and for real. 
Conclusion 

Setting a realistic date certain for the end of analog broadcasting and the recovery 
of the analog spectrum for new purposes is the right thing to do. It is right for con-
sumers,  it  is  right  for  innovation,  and  it  is  right  for  America’s  national  security.  A 
hard  deadline  will  help  foster  the  creation  of  new,  high-skill  jobs,  and  it  will  pro-
mote America’s technology leadership in an increasingly competitive world. 

We commend the Committee for its efforts to bring the broadcast DTV transition 
to a successful and timely conclusion. In the meantime, we will continue our efforts 
to  educate  consumers  about  digital  television.  I  pledge  CEA’s  continuing  commit-
ment  to  working  with  this  committee  and  other  stakeholders  to  ensure  the  most 
timely  and  consumer  friendly  transition,  as  well  as  a  prompt  return  of  the  analog 
broadcast spectrum. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
And, last witness, Michael Calabrese, the Vice President and Di-
rector  of  Wireless  Future  Program  for  the  New  America  Founda-
tion. 

Mr. Calabrese? 

STATEMENT  OF  MICHAEL  CALABRESE,  VICE  PRESIDENT/ 
DIRECTOR,  WIRELESS  FUTURE  PROGRAM,  NEW  AMERICA 
FOUNDATION 
Mr.  CALABRESE.  Yes,  good  afternoon.  My  name  is  Michael 
Calabrese. I direct the Wireless Future Program with New America 
Foundation,  which  is  a  nonpartisan  policy  institute  here  in  Wash-
ington. Thank you for inviting my testimony today. 

The  TV  band  has  become  a  vast  wasteland  of  underutilized  air-
waves that are urgently needed for both public safety and for wire-
less  broadband  services,  which  I’ll  emphasize.  On  average,  a  high- 
powered  TV  station  operates  on  each  of  those  channels  in  only  15 
of  the  Nation’s  210  local  television  markets.  And  in  every  market, 
a low and steadily shrinking share of American homes rely on over- 
the-air reception at all. 

Because  of  the  urgent  need  to  reallocate  these  frequencies,  it  is 
critical that Congress not repeat the mistake of the Balanced Budg-
et  Act  of  1997.  The  1997  Budget  Act  set  a  deadline  for  TV  band 
auctions,  but  not  a  policy  to  ensure  that  the  spectrum  would  be 
cleared  by  a  date  certain.  As  a  result,  in  2002,  most  of  those  auc-
tions were canceled, or generated very low returns, for one primary 
reason: wireless firms are not willing to pay market prices for spec-
trum  indefinitely  encumbered  by  politically  powerful  TV  stations.

But  a  credible  hard  deadline,  one  reinforced  by  a  broad  consumer 
compensation program, can spin straw into gold. 

Based  on  recent  private-spectrum  transactions  and  public  bids, 
the ten channels that could be licensed are expected to generate be-
tween  $15  and  $30  billion.  Because  this  auction  value  vastly  ex-
ceeds  the  Committee’s  budget  requirements,  we  recommend  that 
Congress use this opportunity to make three telecom policy invest-
ments with long-term benefits for the general public. 

The  first  is  a  broad-based  converter  rebate  that  ensures  all 
households  still  relying  on  analog  over-the-air  are  held  harmless. 
By earmarking a relatively small share of the expected auction rev-
enues  for  a  consumer  compensation  fund,  Congress  can  both  pro-
tect  vulnerable  consumers,  and  ensure  that  potential  wireless  bid-
ders’ business plans will not be disrupted by a voter backlash. 

Providing  one  $50  converter  box  or  rebate  to  each  of  the  16  mil-
lion  households  that  rely  exclusively  on  over-the-air  reception 
would  cost  about  $800  million.  Providing  one  rebate  to  each  of  the 
44  million  households  that  report  relying  at  all  on  over-the-air  re-
ception  for  their  local  channels  would  cost  about  $2.2  billion.  So, 
that’s the range. 

In  either  case,  the  cost  represents  merely  a  fraction  of  the  rev-
enue  that  TV  band  auctions  will  raise  if,  and  only  if,  bidders  are 
confident the deadline for clearing those channels will not again be 
delayed.  Although  a  means-tested  compensation  program  would  be 
less  expensive,  we  believe  it  is  neither  administratively  practical 
nor  fair.  If  the  Committee  does  not  choose  to  means  test  the  con-
sumer rebate, we believe that, on balance, it would be most cost ef-
ficient to reimburse qualified retailers. 

Qualified  retailers  could  be  required  to  offer  converters  certified 
by  the  FCC  to  limit  the  consumer  share  of  the  cost  to  a  small  co- 
pay and to provide the degree of technical support. If possible, any 
rebate  program  should  also  give  consumers  the  choice  to  use  it  to 
offset  the  cost  of  a  converter  box,  a  new  digital  TV,  or  even  a  sat-
ellite  dish  or  cable  set-top  box,  since  any  of  these  devices  will  pre-
serve access to broadcast channels. 

The  second  public  investment  that  should  be  part  of  this  transi-
tion involves promoting the rapid deployment of affordable and mo-
bile broadband services. Because wireless signals at this frequency 
pass easily through walls and trees, reallocating the 700 megahertz 
band  could  jumpstart  the  deployment  of  more  affordable  wireless 
broadband connections, particularly in rural areas. 

The  U.S.  has  fallen  from  third  to  16th  in  broadband  adoption 
worldwide over the past 5 years, according to the ITU. The lack of 
affordable  highspeed  Internet  access  for  millions  of  homes  and 
small  businesses  in  the  U.S.  is  a  threat  to  American  competitive-
ness. We recommend that Congress address this broadband gap by 
using  the  DTV  transition  to  encourage  both  licensed  and  unli-
censed  wireless  broadband  networks  as  competitive  alternatives  to 
wireline cable, and DSL offerings. 

Thousands of mostly rural commercial Internet service providers, 
or  WISPs,  and  dozens  of  municipalities,  already  use  the  crowded 
unlicensed band at 2.4 gigahertz to deploy WiFi and other wireless 
connections to hundreds of thousands of businesses and consumers, 
at  distances  of  up  to  30  miles.  The  problem  is  that  the  unlicensed 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

109 

WiFi  bands  are  small  and  shared  with  over  200  million  consumer 
devices, from microwave ovens to cordless phones. 

The  DTV  transition  can  promote  rapid,  affordable  broadband  in 
two ways. First, from the ten channels now designated for auction, 
the FCC should be directed to reallocate at least three, roughly 20 
megahertz,  for  shared  unlicensed  use.  Second,  the  FCC  should  be 
directed to complete its pending rulemaking that would open unas-
signed TV channels below Channel 52 for unlicensed public access, 
subject to strict rules to avoid interference. 

Finally,  the  $15  billion  to  $30  billion  market  value  of  the  ten 
channels  available  for  auction  makes  possible  a  third  investment. 
Any  auction  of  the  people’s  airwaves  should  be  seen  as  an  oppor-
tunity  to  invest  in  the  digital  future  of  our  public  media  and  edu-
cational  institutions.  The  proceeds  exceeding  the  CBO  score  could 
be  earmarked  to  capitalize  a  trust  fund,  to  finance  ongoing  invest-
ments in both educational public media and e-learning content and 
applications.  We  recommend  that  the  Committee  incorporate  with-
in this DTV legislation funding for the Digital Opportunity Invest-
ment  Trust,  or  DOIT  Act  that  was  introduced  in  May  by  Senator 
Burns, Senator Snowe, here on your committee, as well as Senators 
Dodd and Durbin, which earmark spectrum revenue for these pur-
poses. 

Thank  you  for  your  time,  and  I  look  forward  to  answering  any 

questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Calabrese follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL CALABRESE, VICE PRESIDENT/DIRECTOR, 

WIRELESS FUTURE PROGRAM, NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  members  of  the  Committee,  for  this  opportunity 
to testify today. My name is Michael Calabrese, Vice President of the New America 
Foundation,  a  nonpartisan  policy  institute  here  in  Washington.  I  direct  New  Amer-
ica’s  Wireless  Future  Program,  which  is  dedicated  to  promoting  more  efficient  and 
fair access to the public airwaves. 

I  will  focus  largely  on  the  opportunity  to  use  this  DTV  legislation  to  advance  the 
national  interest  in  more  rapid  and  affordable  deployment  of  high-speed  broadband 
access, particularly in rural and other underserved areas. Because the market value 
of  the  channels  designated  for  auction  vastly  exceed  the  Committee’s  budget  re-
quirements, I believe the Committee should use this bill to pursue policies that will 
be  far  more  beneficial  to  the  Nation  than  a  budget-driven  bill  that  merely  maxi-
mizes short-term auction revenues. 

Several years ago we began urging members of this committee to set a hard dead-
line for the end of the digital TV transition—and to make that deadline realistic by 
earmarking  a  portion  of  the  resulting  spectrum  revenue  to  compensate  consumers 
needing  to  purchase  a  digital-to-analog  converter  box.  TV  channels  52  to  69  have 
become  a  vast  wasteland  of  underutilized  airwaves  that  are  urgently  needed  for 
both  public  safety  and  for  wireless  broadband  services.  On  average,  a  high-power 
TV station operates on each of those channels in only 7 percent of the Nation’s 210 
local  television  markets;  and  in  every  market,  a  low  and  steadily  shrinking  share 
of  American  homes  rely  on  over-the-air  (OTA)  reception  at  all  (see  Table  1  below).

The Importance of Reallocating Airwaves From Broadcast to Broadband 

The DTV transition no longer has anything to do with high-definition TV, or with 
U.S. competitiveness in TV manufacturing, as Congress was led to believe a decade 
ago.  Today  the  true  threat  to  American  competitiveness  is  the  lack  of  affordable, 
high-speed Internet access for millions of homes and small businesses. The U.S. has 
fallen  from  3rd  to  16th  in  broadband  adoption  worldwide  over  the  past  5  years,  ac-
cording  to  the  International  Telecommunications  Union  (ITU).  Last  fall,  a  Fortune 
magazine  cover  story  reported  that  ‘‘nearly  everyone  in  South  Korea  has  Internet 
access  that  puts  Americans  to  shame.’’  In  South  Korean  cities,  ‘‘broadband  is  as 
basic  a  utility  as  water  and  electricity  . . .  ordinary  households  get  faster  Internet 
connections  than  all  but  the  biggest  U.S.  businesses.’’  The  typical  cable  and  tele-
phone broadband connection here is ten times slower than the 20 megabits-per-sec-
ond speeds offered in South Korea for the same price or less. This ‘‘broadband gap,’’ 
if it continues, will result in slower rates of U.S. innovation, e-business creation, job 
growth, and technological competitiveness in an increasingly digital world.

The  DTV  transition  provides  an  opportunity  for  Congress  to  open  a  third  and 
more  affordable  broadband  pipe  to  homes  and  small  businesses.  Industry  studies 
show  that  because  TV  band  frequencies  (700  MHz  band)  propagate  easily  through 
obstacles,  such  as  walls  and  trees,  access  to  these  low  frequencies  can  reduce  the 
deployment costs for wireless networks by a factor of three or more compared to cel-
lular bands above 2 GHz. Congress can choose to rely on the cable and telco wireline 
duopoly  to  trench  fiber  to  every  home  and  business—or  at  least  those  in  locations 
that  will  be  profitable  to  connect.  Or  we  can  open  the  broadband  pipe  the  public 
already  owns—the  public  airwaves—as  a  common  carrier  for  communities,  entre-
preneurs and innovation. 

Because  of  the  urgent  need  to  reallocate  these  frequencies,  it  is  critical  that  that 
Congress  not  repeat  the  mistake  of  the  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997.  In  an  effort 
to  score  revenue,  the  1997  OBRA  set  a  deadline  for  TV  band  auctions,  but  not  a 
policy  to  ensure  that  the  spectrum  would  be  cleared  by  a  date  certain.  As  a  result, 
in  2002,  most  of  the  auctions  were  canceled  or  generated  very  low  returns  for  one 
primary reason: wireless firms are not willing to pay market prices for spectrum in-
definitely encumbered by politically-powerful TV stations. But a credible hard dead-
line  for  channel  clearance—one  reinforced  by  a  broad  consumer  compensation  pro-
gram—can spin straw into gold. In addition to cellular incumbents, many new wire-
less  service  providers  are  expected  to  bid  on  700  MHz  licenses,  as  they  are  so  well 
suited  for  video,  mobile,  and  other  consumer  broadband  applications.  Based  on  re-
cent  private-spectrum  transactions  and  public  bids—for  cellular  spectrum  with  far

less valuable propagation characteristics—the 10 channels that could be licensed are 
expected to generate between $15 and $30 billion.1 

The  tremendous  market  value  of  the  10  channels  (60  MHz)  available  for  auction 
gives Congress the leeway to avoid passing another shortsighted, budget-driven bill. 
Because  auctioning  even  40  MHz  of  TV  band  spectrum  will  generate  $10  billion  or 
more, we recommend that Congress use this opportunity to make three telecom pol-
icy investments with long-term benefits for the general public: 

• A  broad-based  consumer  converter  box  rebate  that  ensures  all  households  that 

still rely on analog over-the-air reception are held harmless. 

• The reallocation of 20 of the 60 MHz of spectrum available for wireless services 
to  unlicensed  broadband  networks,  as  well  as  the  opening  of  unassigned  DTV 
channels in each market for sharing by low-power unlicensed devices. 

• The  earmarking  of  TV  band  auction  revenue  in  excess  of  the  CBO  ‘‘score’’  into 
a  trust  fund  to  help  finance  the  digital  future  of  public  broadcasting  and  e- 
learning technologies. 

The  ‘‘Last  Granny  Rule’’:  A  Small  Share  of  the  Auction  Revenue  Can 
in 

Compensate  Consumers  and  Ensure  No  Additional  Delay 
Reallocating TV Frequencies 

Because ‘‘free’’ TV has taken on the nature of an entitlement in American culture, 
legislation  that  makes  analog  TV  sets  obsolete  will  be  keenly  felt,  even  in  middle- 
class homes, as a type of ‘‘taking.’’ This is the unwritten obstacle to ending the DTV 
transition that we have called the ‘‘Last Granny Rule’’: even if the FCC or Congress 
sets  a  hard  deadline,  it  will  be  subject  to  delay  (or  defeat)  if  a  substantial  share 
of  voters  relying  on  analog  OTA  view  the  government  as  making  their  TVs  useless 
without  the  purchase  of  a  converter  box  (or  new  DTV).  Manufacturers,  including 
LG/Zenith and Zoran, now estimate that in mass production, a digital-to-analog con-
verter would sell for $50. 2

* The  FCC’s  Report  Concerning  Over-the-Air  Broadcast  Television  Viewers  notes  that  14.98  percent  of  U.S. 
TV  households  rely  exclusively  on  OTA,  citing  the  2005  MVPD  Report.  See:  FCC,  ‘‘Media  Bureau  Staff  Report 
Concerning  Over-the-Air  Broadcast  Viewers,’’  February  28,  2005,  and  FCC,  ‘‘Annual  Assessment  of  the  Status

*** NAB/MSTV  data  indicates  28  million  unwired  sets  are  in  use  in  the  Nation’s  92.3  cable/DSL  households.

210. 

**** Option  #4  is  the  solution  most  called  for  by  the  NAB,  which  assumes  that  a  converter  subsidy  be  made 
available for every analog TV set in all households that rely on OTA (i.e., all sets not connected to cable, DBS, 
or another subscriber service.) 

By earmarking a relatively small share of the expected auction revenues for a con-
sumer  compensation  fund,  Congress  can  both  protect  vulnerable  consumers  while 
also ensuring potential wireless bidders that their business plans won’t be disrupted 
by  a  voter  backlash.  As  the  table  just  above  demonstrates,  providing  one  $50  con-
verter  box  to  each  of  the  16  million  households  that  rely  exclusively  on  OTA  recep-
tion  would  cost  about  $800  million.  The  cost  of  one  converter  box  for  each  of  the 
nearly  44  million  households  (including  28  million  cable  and  DBS  subscribers)  that 
report  relying  at  all  on  OTA  reception  is  $2.2  billion. 3 In  either  case,  the  cost  rep-
resents  merely  a  fraction  of  the  revenue  that  TV  band  auctions  will  raise  if,  and 
only if, bidders are confident the deadline for clearing those channels will not again 
be delayed. 
Options for Making Consumer Rebate Generally Available 
1. A Consumer Mail-In Rebate 

• Advantages:  Rebate  forms  can  be  used  to  limit  eligibility—or  limit  the  number 

of subsidies per household—by tracking consumer information. 

• Disadvantages:  Consumers  must  pay  up-front  before  getting  a  refund,  which 
disproportionately  impacts  low-income  and  fixed-income  households;  the  paper-
work required to process rebate applications would be costly for both consumers 
and government; it may be impossible to limit the subsidy to low-income house-
holds without costly and intrusive cross-checking through IRS. 

2. A Qualified Retailer Rebate 

• Advantages:  Consumers  are  not  required  to  pay  anything  up-front;  offering  the 
converter  ‘‘free,’’  or  at  very  low-cost  (co-pay),  eliminates  ‘‘red  tape’’  for  the  cus-
tomer,  reduces  administrative  costs,  and  enhances  satisfaction  with  process; 
participating  retailers  could  be  required  to  offer  optional  installation  and/or 
technical support services. 

• Disadvantages:  Retailers  cannot  limit  the  eligibility,  or  number  of  converter 
subsidies,  by  household  (individuals  acquiring  converters  from  multiple  stores); 
limits  could  be  enforced  only  by  mailing  a  coupon  to  each  eligible  household 
(e.g., one per household via counties). 

3 NAB/MSTV data indicates 28 million unwired sets are in use in the Nation’s 92.3 cable/DSL 
households.  Approximately  30  percent  of  subscription  TV  households  would  thus  have  any  use 
for  a  converter  subsidy.  See  NAB/MSTV,  Comments,  In  the  Matter  of  Over-the-Air  Broadcast 
Viewers, August 11, 2004, MB Docket 04–210.

3.  A  Refundable  Tax  Credit  (Refund  Occurs  Whether  There  Is  A  Tax  Liability  Or 

Not) 

• Advantages:  Easier  to  confer  a  means-tested  subsidy;  reduces  fraud  by  linking 
to  consumer  information;  administratively  efficient  if  done  during  a  single  tax 
year. 
• Disadvantages:  Lower  take-up  rate  possible  among  low-income  households  who 
lack easy access to tax information, or do not file taxes at all; substantial time- 
delay between purchase and the tax refund; additional tax form complexity. 

We believe that a means-tested compensation program is neither administratively 
practical  nor  fair.  Verifying  eligibility  requires  access  to  tax  return  information— 
which rules out rebating the subsidy directly to retailers. A mail-in application (Op-
tion  1  above),  premised  on  the  consumer’s  estimate  of  family  income,  would  raise 
concerns about privacy and accuracy. While a refundable tax credit (Option 3 above) 
could  piggy-back  the  existing  individual  tax  return  process  by  adding  a  line  for  a 
single  tax  year,  consumers  would  need  to  pay  first,  wait  months  for  a  refund,  and 
be able to show a proof of purchase if audited. It would also deter low-income earn-
ers not required to file. 

Because the auction of the public’s airwaves will generate more than enough rev-
enue to compensate consumers, it seems only fair to offer at least one rebate to each 
household. Indeed, the government’s failure to require warnings on analog TVs pur-
chased during the past five-to-ten years will only heighten the perception among the 
middle-class  that  they  should  be  compensated  for  a  policy  change  that  forces  them 
to  purchase  a  converter  box  or  new  digital  TV.  Although  the  18-month  transition 
in  Berlin,  Germany,  relied  on  a  means-tested  subsidy—the  government  purchased 
and distributed DTA converters directly to 6,000 very low-income households—more 
affluent  households  also  immediately  received  a  far  greater  number  of  digital  OTA 
channel selections in return for purchasing a converter or new DTV. 

If  the  Committee  does  not  choose  to  means-test  the  consumer  rebate,  we  believe 
that  on  balance  it  will  be  most  cost-efficient  to  reimburse  ‘‘qualified’’  retailers  (Op-
tion  2  above).  These  retailers  would  need  to  agree  to  offer  converters  certified  by 
the FCC, to limit the consumer share of the cost (e.g., a small ‘‘co-pay’’), and to pro-
vide  a  degree  of  technical  support.  If  eligibility  is  limited  to  one  rebate  per  house-
hold,  a  coupon  could  be  mailed  to  each  household.  If  possible,  any  rebate  program 
should  give  consumers  the  choice  to  use  it  to  offset  the  cost  of  a  converter  box,  a 
new  digital  TV,  or  even  a  satellite  dish  or  cable  set-top  box,  since  any  of  these  de-
vices will preserve access to broadcast channels and serve the policy purpose of the 
DTV transition. 
The  DTV  Transition  Should  Facilitate  Both  Licensed  and  Unlicensed 

Wireless Broadband Deployment, Particularly in Rural Areas 

New  wireless  networks  are  extending  more  affordable  broadband  access  to  new 
communities  in  every  state,  spurring  economic  development  and  helping  to  bridge 
the  digital  divide.  Clouds  of  wireless  connectivity  now  cover  college  campuses  and 
downtown  business  districts—‘‘hot  zones’’  that  expand  on  the  WiFi  ‘‘hot  spots’’  now 
offering unwired Internet connections at 18,000 locations nationwide. 4 These zones, 
in turn, are becoming clouds, extending ubiquitous broadband access to entire towns 
and  counties.  Commercial  wireless  Internet  service  providers  (WISPs)  are  con-
necting  homes,  farms,  and  small  businesses  to  broadband  at  distances  of  up  to  30 
miles.  Municipal  networks—in  small  towns  like  Chaska,  Minnesota,  and  in  rural 
villages  like  Coffman  Cove,  Alaska—are  blanketing  under-served  areas  with  high- 
speed Internet access at affordable prices. In other towns—such as Scottsburg, Indi-
ana—public-private  broadband  networks  have  saved  jobs  by  keeping  businesses 
from  moving  out.  And  in  other  towns—such  as  Granbury,  Texas,  and  San  Mateo, 
California—these same networks serve as mobile communications systems for police 
and other public safety agencies. 

What all of these innovative broadband networks have in common is the tiny sliv-
er  of  unlicensed  frequencies  they  use  to  transmit  signals.  In  fact,  far  more  homes 
and  small  businesses  now  rely  on  wireless  Internet  services  delivered  over  unli-
censed  spectrum,  while  very  few  last-mile  broadband  connections  (and  zero  munic-
ipal wireless hot zones) have been deployed on licensed bands. Thousands of mostly 
rural  commercial  Internet  service  providers  (WISPs),  and  dozens  of  municipalities 
and  nonprofit  community  networks,  already  use  the  crowded  2.4  GHz  unlicensed 
band to deploy wireless connections to hundreds of thousands of businesses and con-
sumers.  Unlicensed  spectrum  has  spurred  billions  of  dollars  in  economic  activity,

saved  jobs,  and  opened  up  new  opportunities  for  local  economic  development,  par-
ticularly in rural areas. 

WiFi  is  just  the  beginning  of  a  wireless  paradigm  shift—a  radio  revolution  pre-
mised  on  shared,  unlicensed  access  to  the  airwaves  that  will  determine  if  the  U.S. 
will  be  a  leader  or  a  laggard  in  the  next  generation  of  Internet  technologies.  Like 
licensed cellular providers, who need more and better spectrum to meet the growing 
demand  for  wireless  data  services,  an  allocation  of  low-frequency  spectrum  for 
shared,  unlicensed  access  will  promote  the  deployment  and  lower  the  cost  of  Inter-
net  access  provided  by  entrepreneurial  WISPs  and  community  networks.  The  prob-
lem  is  that  the  WiFi  band  (2.4  GHz)  is  small,  uneconomical,  and  shared  with  well 
over  200  million  consumer  devices,  from  microwave  ovens  to  cordless  phones,  and 
baby monitors. Opening returned (and unassigned) TV band spectrum for WISP and 
community  access  on  an  unlicensed  basis  will  greatly  stimulate  broadband  deploy-
ment, rural access, and growth in America’s high-tech sector. 

We  recommend  that  Congress  use  the  DTV  transition  to  encourage  both  licensed 
and unlicensed wireless broadband networks as competitive alternatives to wireline 
cable and DSL offerings. DTV transition legislation can accomplish this in two ways: 
First,  from  the  60  MHz  (10  channels)  in  the  700  MHz  band  now  designated  by 
the  FCC  for  auction  and  exclusive  licensing,  the  FCC  should  be  directed  to  reallo-
cate  20  MHz  for  shared,  unlicensed  use  under  Part  15  rules.  Even  if  only  40  MHz 
is auctioned for exclusive use, this is in addition to the 90 MHz reallocated for auc-
tion  next  year  under  the  Commercial  Spectrum  Enhancement  Act  signed  into  law 
just last December. In the low-frequency, high-penetration frequencies below 2 GHz 
(the  ‘‘beachfront’’  spectrum),  26  MHz  is  currently  allocated  for  unlicensed  devices 
versus roughly 290 MHz for licensed cellular services.5 

Second, the bill should direct the FCC to complete its pending rulemaking (Docket 
04–186)  that  would  open  unassigned  TV  channels  below  Channel  52  for  unlicensed 
public  access,  subject  to  rules  designed  to  avoid  risk  of  harmful  interference  to  the 
dwindling  number  of  over-the-air  DTV  consumers.  Even  after  the  DTV  transition, 
Channels 2 through 51–288 MHz of prime spectrum—remain designated exclusively 
for TV broadcasting. Yet only about seven TV stations are licensed to operate at full 
power  in  each  market,  on  average.  Even  fewer  stations  operate  in  some  rural  mar-
kets. As former FCC Chairman Michael Powell recognized when he initiated the no-
tice  of  proposed  rulemaking  last  year,  the  unassigned  ‘‘white  space’’  can  be  opened, 
on  a  market-by-market  basis,  for  shared,  unlicensed  use  by  operators  using  equip-
ment certified by the FCC to ensure there is no interference with licensed DTV sta-
tions on nearby frequencies. 

Unfortunately,  this  rulemaking  has  drawn  intense  opposition  from  the  broadcast 
lobby, which would rather keep open the possibility of owning or using today’s wast-
ed guard band spectrum in the future. To ensure that this vast ‘‘white space’’ waste-

5 In  the  nearby  but  less  valuable  2–3GHz  band,  the  ratio  of  licensed  cellular  to  unlicensed 
spectrum  is  less  than  the  ratio  below  2  GHz,  but  still  more  than  two  to  one.  The  unlicensed 
WiFi  band  at  2.4  GHz  has  83.5  MHz  of  spectrum,  but  the  licensed  cellular  bands,  mostly  at 
2.5 GHz, occupy more than 200 MHz of spectrum.

land is used for affordable broadband and wireless innovation more broadly, we rec-
ommend that Congress adopt findings to that effect and direct the FCC to complete 
the proceeding within 6 months. 
Auction  Revenue  Above  the  ‘‘Score’’  Should  Be  Designated  To  Capitalize  a 
Trust  Fund  for  the  Digital  Future  of  Public  Broadcasting  and 
E-Learning Technology 

While reclaiming spectrum for public safety and advanced wireless services is crit-
ical,  we  urge  Congress  to  take  advantage  of  the  resulting  auction  revenue  windfall 
to  ensure  that  our  Nation’s  public  service  media  can  thrive  in  this  digital  future. 
Public  broadcasting  is  uniquely  positioned  to  be  a  leading  part  of  the  solution  to 
many  of  the  fundamental  challenges  facing  our  society.  It  can  harness  digital  tech-
nologies  to  expand  public  media  services  in  education,  homeland  security,  public 
health, and civic affairs that would not otherwise be available on commercial chan-
nels—and it can create wholly new and dynamic approaches over both added digital 
channels  and  over  the  Internet  and  other  new  media  platforms.  Nowhere  is  an  en-
hanced  role  for  public  service  media  more  vital  than  for  early  childhood  learning, 
as  well  as  for  learning  lifelong.  America’s  classrooms  and  homes  could  better  boost 
academic  achievement  if  they  had  ready  access  to  the  high-quality  multimedia  re-
sources  that  are  needed  to  engage  teachers  and  students  in  information  age  learn-
ing. 

Over the past 6 months, I have had the honor of directing the Digital Future Ini-
tiative,  a  panel  of  prominent  leaders  from  both  inside  and  outside  of  the  public 
broadcasting  system,  which  has  been  meeting  to  consider  how  public  broadcasting 
should  reshape  its  role  and  exploit  emerging  digital  technologies  to  meet  critical 
public  needs,  particularly  in  education.  This  Digital  Future  Initiative,  Co-Chaired 
by Jim Barksdale, the former CEO of Netscape, and Reed Hundt, former Chairman 
of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission,  will  issue  a  report  by  September  that 
will describe why an investment in a modernized and expanded public service media 
system  would  be  so  beneficial  for  the  nation.  We  hope  you  will  consider  this  need 
in thinking about the value of reinvesting spectrum revenue to enhance the Nation’s 
digital future. 

Any  auction  of  the  people’s  airwaves  should  be  seen  as  an  opportunity  to  invest 
in the digital future of our public media and educational institutions. As noted ear-
lier,  because  the  TV  band  auctions  are  likely  to  yield  more  revenue  than  the  Con-
gressional  Budget  Office  will  officially  project,  we  recommend  that  the  proceeds  ex-
ceeding the CBO ‘‘score’’ be earmarked to capitalize a trust fund to finance ongoing 
investments in both educational media and e-learning content and applications. Leg-
islation  that  does  exactly  this  was  introduced  by  two  members  of  this  Committee 
in  May.  Senators  Snowe  and  Burns,  along  with  Senators  Dodd  and  Durbin,  have 
introduced  a  trust  fund  proposal  that  would  be  funded  from  earmarked  spectrum 
revenue—the Digital Opportunity Investment Trust (DOIT) Act. The DOIT Act calls 
for  the  creation  of  a  trust  to  finance,  among  other  things,  the  digitization  of  mate-
rials  stored  in  museums  and  libraries,  as  well  as  research  and  development  to  im-
prove  digital  educational  content,  media,  and  methods.  The  DOIT  Act  includes  an 
annual  21  percent  set-aside  to  public  broadcasting  entities  for  digital  educational 
content development.6 That Act should be incorporated into the DTV transition leg-
islation. 

Finally, while broadcasters lobby for multicast must-carry rights, they oppose any 
expansion  of  their  public  interest  programming  obligations.  The  U.S.  stands  apart 
from  the  developed  world  in  giving  commercial  broadcasters  free  must-carry  rights 
and  the  option  to  negotiate  payments  from  cable  and  DBS  systems  (retransmission 
consent).7 Licensees should be required to use DTV’s enormously increased capacity 
to  expand  the  coverage  of  diverse  viewpoints  and  of  local  civic  affairs  and  election 
contests.  In  exchange  for  their  far  more  valuable  DTV  licenses,  Congress  could  re-
quire  broadcasters  to  air  a  minimum  of  3  hours  per  week  of  local  civic  or  electoral 
affairs  programming.8 Studies  have  shown  the  many  ways  in  which  broadcasters 
fail to deliver meaningful coverage of local civic and electoral affairs:

• Local  public  affairs  accounts  for  less  than  one  half  of  1  percent  of  all  program-

ming on local television stations, according to a 2003 study.9 

• Elections  below  the  Presidential  level  receive  meager  coverage.  During  several 
weeks  leading  up  to  the  2002  midterm  elections,  most  newscasts  on  local  TV 
stations contained virtually no election coverage at all.10 

• While  cutting  campaign  coverage,  broadcasters  are  airing  more—and  making 
more money from—paid political advertising than ever before. In the 2004 elec-
tions, candidates, parties, and independent groups spent $1.6 billion on TV ads 
in  the  Nation’s  100  largest  media  markets—more  than  double  the  $771  million 
spent in 2000.11 

We  believe  that  like  the  current  minimum  standard  for  airing  children’s  edu-
cational programming, a license renewal processing guideline that called on stations 
to air a minimum amount of programming related to local civic issues and elections, 
under their own editorial control, would not present Constitutional problems. Alter-
natively,  commercial  broadcasters  should  pay  an  annual  spectrum  user  fee  to  fi-
nance a trust fund for the digital future of public broadcasting and educational con-
tent more broadly.12 
Conclusion 

Local  TV  broadcasting,  perhaps  the  most  profitable,  legal  business  in  America 
today,  has  arguably  received  the  largest  government  subsidies  in  U.S.  history.  Yet, 
there  is  no  end  in  sight  to  the  digital  TV  transition.  Every  year  this  delay  imposes 
an  opportunity  cost  of  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  on  taxpayers  and  consumers  who 
are  deprived  of  both  payment  for  commercial  use  of  the  public  airwaves,  and  the 
economic  value  that  spectrum-starved  wireless  broadband  services  providers  could 
provide more efficiently at low frequencies. 

We  urge  Congress  to  foreclose  any  further  delay  by  setting  a  fixed  deadline  for 
the  return  and  clearance  of  TV  Channels  52–69.  The  best  means  to  this  end  is  a 
broad-based  consumer  converter  box  rebate  that  ensures  all  households  that  still 
rely on analog over-the-air reception are held harmless. The resulting certainty will 
ensure the public receives full market value from the auction of a portion of the re-
turn  channels.  However,  we  also  strongly  recommend  that  roughly  one-third  (20 
MHz)  of  the  TV  band  spectrum  reallocated  for  wireless  services  be  reserved  for 
shared,  unlicensed  wireless  broadband,  which  is  particularly  important  for  extend-
ing affordable Internet access to rural and other under-served areas. 

Finally, we recommend that auction revenue that exceeds the CBO ‘‘score’’ be des-
ignated to capitalize a trust fund to finance the digital future of public broadcasting 
and for e-learning services, such as in the proposed Digital Opportunity Investment 
Trust legislation. 

Thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  testify.  I  will  be  most  happy  to  respond 
to  any  questions,  or  to  assist  staff  as  the  Committee  develops  its  own  solution  to 
this important problem. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you very much. 
Mr. Kennedy, I think that we’ve a attrited a little bit, so we have 
lost  part  of  your  audience.  But  I  think  we  should  proceed  now,  if 
we may. 

Mr. KENNEDY. My pleasure, Senator.

ceivers,  which  makes  them  easy  to  carry  over  here  to  show  you. 
But these are equivalent to the television receiver that we all have 
at home somewhere, often in that upstairs bedroom. 

I’ve  got  this  receiver  hooked  to  that  $50  converter  box  that  I 
talked  about.  This  receiver  is  not  hooked  to  the  converter  box. 
They’re  receiving  an  off-the-air  analog  television  signal  through 
that  rabbit-ear  antenna  over  there.  So,  you  can  see,  by  that,  this 
is a very similar situation to what we would have at home. 

This  is  Channel  4  here  in  Washington,  D.C.  I  hope  you  can  see 
it. It’s right off of that antenna, over-the-air analog broadcast. You 
can  see,  the  picture  has  what  we  would  call  interference,  or  snow, 
in it. It’s not a very clear picture. It’s perhaps a watchable picture, 
but it’s certainly not a very good picture. 

Now  I’m  going  to  bring  up  the  same  channel  that’s  been  passed 
through  this  converter  box.  I  hope  you  can  all  see  the  difference. 

Senator BURNS. Is that the same station? 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Same  station,  slightly  delayed,  because  there’s  a 
little  bit  of  processing  in  the  converter  box.  So,  you’re—now,  you 
wouldn’t notice this at home—you wouldn’t have the two sets next 
to each other—but there’s a slight delay. You can certainly see the 
interference here, and the interference is gone there. 

Senator  BURNS.  Now,  I  have  cable  on  that  channel  in  my 

house—— 

Mr. KENNEDY. You have cable. 
Senator  BURNS.—in  Arlington,  and  I  get  the  same  lines  off  that 

cable as you’re getting right there. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. KENNEDY. I think the problem is, Senator—— 
Senator BURNS. I pay $47 for those lines. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. KENNEDY. You must not be using a Motorola set-top box. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. KENNEDY. We’ll come out and take a look at that. 
Senator DEMINT. Is this a digital signal? 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  This  is  a  digital  signal,  where  it  says  ‘‘converted 
over-the-air.’’  Pardon  me,  the  converter  box  is  taking  the  digital 
signal  that’s  being  broadcast  by  Channel  4  today.  It  is  formatting 
that to display it on an analog television. 

Senator DEMINT. Now, on the right, we have a digital signal—— 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  On  the  right,  you  have  an  analog  signal.  That’s 

today’s over-the-air television. That’s exactly what you have. 

Senator DEMINT. So, you have simulcast of analog and digital. 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Yes.  Yes.  So,  we  get  a  cleaner  picture.  And  then 
if  I  can—let  me  go  back  here.  A  number  of  TV  broadcasters  are 
also  using  their  digital  signal  to  multicast,  to  send  more  than  one 
signal  out  to  their  audience.  Here  you  can  see,  this  is  Channel  4, 
their  second  channel.  So,  not  only  with  this  converter  box  do  you 
get  a  cleaner  TV  signal,  but  you  get  additional  channels  to  watch. 
And, as I go through these, Channel 7, their main broadcast, Chan-
nel 7, their second signal—that’s not possible on the analog set. 

Senator DEMINT. If it was a digital-only signal, would the TV on 

the right be blank? 

Mr.  KENNEDY.  Yes,  if  the  analog  signal  were  turned  off.  In  fact, 
that’s  why—one  thing  we’re  here  to  talk  about  today,  the  15  per-

is—— 

cent,  roughly,  of  the  homes  with  sets  out  there  who  would  not  be 
able to receive a digital signal, absent some sort of a converter like 
this. 

And let me just show you one other thing. Channel 26 is actually 
broadcasting  four  multicast  channels.  So,  this  is  the  second  Chan-
nel  26,  second  channel.  You  can  see,  here  is  Channel  26  for  kids. 
Senator  DEMINT.  Could  they  do  ten  channels  if  they  wanted  to? 
Mr. KENNEDY. I’m not that good of an engineer. I think there are 

about—four or five is about the limit. 

The CHAIRMAN. Is that digital-ready—is it total-digital now? This 

gone up. 

Mr. KENNEDY. It’s total-digital. 
The CHAIRMAN.—digital receiver, digital signal. 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Yes,  the  digital  signal  is  being  broadcast  by  the 
television  station,  and  it’s  being  received  by  this  digital  receiver, 
this converter box, and turned into an analog signal. 
Senator DEMINT. I think we just saw a digital cliff. 
The CHAIRMAN. No, that’s the reverse of a cliff, because this has 

Senator DEMINT. But it’s going down. 
The CHAIRMAN. No, it’s—it’s a digital signal coming in—— 
Senator DEMINT. There it went. 
The CHAIRMAN.—on analog, and turned into digital. 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Right.  No,  I’m  sorry,  sir.  This  is  a  digital  signal 
coming in, being converted to analog so we can see it on an analog 
television. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Oh,  I—yes,  he’s  right,  then.  All  right.  I  was 

wrong. 

Mr.  KENNEDY.  That’s  it.  As  I  said  earlier,  we—with  a  hard  date 
for  DTV  transition,  we’d  have  that  box  on  the  market  in  January 
of 2009, for $50. 

The CHAIRMAN. Ooh, that’s a wake-up call. 
Well,  we  do  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Kennedy.  That’s  inter-
esting  to  see.  A  colleague  of  mine,  my  age,  says,  at  the  time  when 
you  get  a  digital  signal  on  a  digital-ready  set,  it’s  like  being  in  a 
new generation. It’s really a wonderful opportunity. 

We  are  at  the  point  where  we’ll  ask  members  if  they  have  any 

questions. 

Senator Inouye? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  would  like  to  ask  Chief  McEwen  a  question, 
if I may. If Congress establishes a hard date, how long will it take 
your organizations to build systems and acquire the equipment nec-
essary to put the 24 megahertz of spectrum into use? 

Mr. MCEWEN. Well, that’s the heart of the issue for public safety, 

to be very honest, and I appreciate the question. 

Without a date certain, nobody will plan to use the spectrum, be-
cause  they  can’t  get  the  funding  that  will  be  committed  either  by 
local,  state,  or  Federal  sources.  And,  to  be  very  honest  with  you— 
I  don’t  want  to  speak  for  Mr.  Kennedy,  but  we’ve  been  told  by  the 
manufacturers  that  they  aren’t  even  going  to  begin  to  produce 
equipment that we could use until there is a date certain, because, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00122 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

119 

for instance, if you establish a date certain of 2008, and they start-
ed  to  develop  equipment  today  for  our  use,  that  could  be  obsolete 
in  two  or  3  years,  and  they  could  develop  much  better  equipment, 
you know, at the time that they know that this is going to be pur-
chased.  Nobody  is  going  to  purchase  equipment  until  they  can  use 
it. So it’s kind of a difficult problem for us. 

So,  the  issue  here  is  that  if  you  start—to  give  you  an  example 
to  try  to  answer  your  question—if  you  were  to  start  to  develop  a 
system,  if  we  had  a  date  certain  of  today,  and  we  started  today,  it 
takes about a year of planning, and licensing, and developing your 
whole  plan.  It  takes  another  year  of  putting  out  a  request  for  pro-
posal  for  the  equipment  that  you’re  going  to  purchase,  and  a  deci-
sion  has  to  be  made  to  purchase  equipment.  And  it  takes  another 
year  for  that  equipment  to  be  purchased,  or  to  be  built,  and  to  be 
actually  put  into  service.  So,  it  takes  about  a  minimum  of  3  years 
from  the  date  we  start  that  process.  So,  if  you  give  us  a  date  cer-
tain,  we  can  actually  begin  to  develop  that  strategy  at  that  point 
in time when we know there is a date certain. 

Does that answer the question? 
Senator  INOUYE.  Yes.  In  other  words,  if  we  delay  the  hard  date 

too long, we’ll be having several disasters before you’re finished. 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  I  would  say  that’s  very  likely.  I  mean,  that’s  a 
very  sad  situation  that  could  happen.  I  mean,  no  matter  what  you 
do  today—we’ve  been  waiting  since  1997,  when  the  Congress  told 
the  FCC  to  give  us  this  spectrum,  so  there’s  been  a  whole  series 
of  years  we’ve  been  waiting.  This  is  an  important  thing  for  us,  to 
get that date set. 

Senator INOUYE. Well, I’m certain that all of the members of the 
Committee  support  your  efforts.  We’ll  have  to  work  out  some  way 
to accommodate you. 

Mr. Kennedy? 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Senator,  thank  you.  I  just  wanted  to  underscore 
one point. Because the problems that Mr. McEwen talks about are 
very  real  problems  for  the  public-safety  community  and  for  manu-
facturers,  one  of  the  things  that  we  have  done  is,  we  have  already 
implemented some of these frequencies in some of the public-safety 
systems we sell today. In other words, the frequencies we’re talking 
about here are adjacent to currently licensed and used frequencies. 
And  we’ve  taken  the  opportunity  to  load  them  into  some  of  our 
walkie-talkies, our police radios. There are about 100,000 out there 
in service now. They can’t be turned on, they can’t be used in these 
frequencies,  because  of  the  issues  with  DTV.  But  we  have  tried  to 
get, sort of, a jumpstart on getting the right kind of radios into the 
public-safety marketplace. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Kennedy,  since  you’re  on  there,  you  said 
that  the  converter  boxes  will  be  available.  When  will  these  boxes 
be available? 

Mr.  KENNEDY.  I  said  January  of  2009.  We  need,  again,  the  cer-

tainty of a hard date to really commit to the program. 

Senator INOUYE. That’s providing the hard date is 2006? 
Mr. KENNEDY. I’m assuming 2008. 
Senator  INOUYE.  Should  consumers  have  the  ability  to  get  sub-

sidized converter boxes?

120 

Mr. KENNEDY. You know, I think that’s a question, really, for the 
Committee. The box is not that complicated to build. It—you know, 
it’s—it  could  be  built  by  other  manufacturers  also.  It  isn’t,  in  a 
sense,  the—from  our  perspective,  the  business  of  selling  the  box  is 
not  really  the  goal  here.  Our  goal  is  to  try  to  help  free  up  all  of 
the radio spectrum. 

Senator  INOUYE.  I’d  like  to  follow  up  on  a  question  that  the 

Chairman asked. Are there any U.S. manufacturers of TV sets? 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  I  assume  that’s  for  me.  Yes,  there  are.  In  fact, 
there  is  significant  manufacturing  which  occurs  in  the  United 
States,  of  projection  and  cathode-ray  tubes  in  Pennsylvania  and  in 
California, I believe, and in Arkansas, as well. And I can follow up 
in writing. 

There’s  a  lot  of  talk,  though.  The  broadcasters  have  said  foreign 
manufacturers—they  have  certainly  done  a  good  job  of  trying  to 
create that impression. 

We  have  almost  two  million  jobs  in  the  United  States  connected 
with  the  consumer-electronics  industry.  And,  to  the  extent  that 
manufacturing  has  shifted  abroad,  it’s  shifted  from  Mexico  to 
China, it hasn’t shifted from the U.S. out. And these are, you know, 
very low-scale factory jobs. 

The  reality  is,  there’s  a  tremendous  amount  that’s  done  in  the 
United  States  with  chip  development,  with  designs,  with  sophisti-
cated  displays  of  the  entire  range  of  the  consumer  electronics  in-
dustry.  And  certainly  there’s  a  tremendous  amount  of  manufac-
turing of TV sets that occurs abroad. 

The  reality  is,  the  entire  industry  is  one  which  is  multinational 
and  is  pulling  along  a  good  portion  of  the  U.S.  economy,  and  that 
goes  from  TVs  and  displays  to  all  sorts  of  devices.  The  average 
American  family  now  owns  25  consumer  electronics  products. 
These  are  devices  which  are  making  a  huge  difference  in  our  pro-
ductivity, in our ability to telework, and everything else. 

So, coloring this as an issue of overseas production is very decep-
tive, because, again, it was from Mexico to China, to a large extent. 
But  manufacturing  occurs  all  over  the  world,  and  especially  if  you 
look  at  components  and  chips,  a  lot  of  that  occurs  in  the  United 
States. 

Senator INOUYE. My time is up now. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Burns? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator BURNS. Thank you. 
Just  for  the  record,  we’ve  got  all  kinds  of  spectrum  out  there. 
Why,  this  700  megahertz,  does  it  become  very  important?  What  is 
it—anybody,  anybody  answer  that.  This  is  a  technical  question,  I 
know.  Why  does  that  work,  and  not  the  600,  or  the  800,  or  what-
ever? Give me an idea. 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  Public  safety  is  in  multiple  bands.  We  go  into  the 
30 toP megahertz band, we’re in the 150 megahertz band, we’re in 
the 450, we’re in 700 to 800. And we’ve got some new 4.9 gigahertz. 
So, we’re all over the place. And the main reason is that spectrum 
is—as  you  know,  is  a  valuable  commodity,  and  there  isn’t  enough 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

121 

spectrum  in  any  one  place  to  allocate  it  without  displacing  other 
people for public-safety’s needs. 

The Congress and the FCC, in 1996, made the decision that, be-
cause  of  the  way  this—this  analog  conversion  to  digital  was  going 
to take place, that it was an opportunity for public safety to get the 
additional  spectrum  that  they  needed.  That’s  why  that  particular 
band.  There  isn’t  any  spectrum  currently  available  in  those  other 
bands  that  you’re  suggesting.  So,  that’s  why  it’s  important  to  us. 
Senator  BURNS.  In  other  words,  you  chose  to  displace  the  broad-

cast industry—— 

Mr. MCEWEN. No. 
Senator BURNS. What? 
Mr. MCEWEN. No, we didn’t choose it. The FCC and the Congress 
knew  that  this  spectrum  was  going  to  be  available  when  the  con-
version from analog—I mean, if you understand, when you go from 
an  analog  channel  this  wide,  down  to  digital  channels  this  wide, 
that  left  spectrum.  And  the  decision  was  made  that  this  was  spec-
trum  that  would  be  good  for  the  use  of  public  safety.  And  it’s  very 
good for mobile-type communications. 

Senator  BURNS.  But  it  does  not  contain  any  other  quality,  other 

than that, then there’s just a big chunk of it. 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  And  it’s  very  good  for  mobile-type  use,  is  the  pur-

pose for us. It’s very—— 

Senator  BURNS.  We’ve  somebody  else  who  wants  to  talk.  Yes? 

Yes? 

Mr. CALABRESE. Senator, the—when you get below—it’s very im-
portant to get below one gigahertz, for broadband. I mean, I’m sure 
there  are  reasons,  for  public  safety,  but  I’m  familiar  with  wireless 
broadband.  Vulcan  Ventures  and  other  firms  have  done  studies 
that  show  that  the  deployment  cost  for  a  wireless  broadband  net-
work  drops  by  a  factor  of  at  least  three  when  you  compare,  for  ex-
ample, deploying broadband in the WiFi band, which is up, say, at 
2.4 gigahertz, compared to being below one gigahertz. 

So,  for—one  reason  is,  then,  you  can  go  out  and  build  a  rural 
broadband  network  at  one-third  the  cost  if  you  get  into  the  TV 
band. And the other reason we look at the TV band is because, you 
know,  the—even  after  the  DTV  transition,  broadcasting  will  have 
49 channels, 288 megahertz of that prime spectrum, and yet there’s 
only  an  average  of  seven  full-power  stations  operating  in  each  of 
the  Nation’s  210  markets.  So,  even  though  there  might  be  20  in 
New  York  or  Los  Angeles,  when  you’re  in  Alaska  or  some  other 
states there may only be four, or five, or six, and yet we’re wasting 
all of that prime spectrum that could really lower the cost of rural 
broadband deployment. 
Senator BURNS. Yes? 
Mr. TOWNSEND. Senator, is this a trick question? 
Senator BURNS. Sort of. 
Mr. TOWNSEND. OK, I’ll try it. 
Senator BURNS. Throw me a tricky answer. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr.  TOWNSEND.  We’ve  operated  at  many  different  frequencies— 
at  1900,  800,  700—as  you  know,  I  think—that’s  why  I  asked  you 
that  question—for  every  700  megahertz  of  spectrum  that  you  go 
up—from  0  to  700,  700  to  1400,  1400  to  2100—the  distance  that

that  signal  can  travel  gets  cut  in  half.  So—I  mean,  just  generally; 
it’s  not  exactly  right,  but  that’s  generally  it—so,  a  700  megahertz 
signal can travel about two and a half times as far as a 1900 PCS 
signal. That’s a big deal. It means that you can cover 1,000 square 
miles with a single cell site, compared to four cell sites at 1900. So, 
the  cost  of  deploying  a  nationwide  network,  particularly  in  rural 
areas, is dramatically cheaper at 700. 

The  second  advantage  is  that  the  700  megahertz  signal,  kind  of, 
goes  straight.  So,  it  goes  right  through  walls,  and  buildings,  and 
everything  else.  Whereas,  the  1900  signal  has  that  old  sine  curve 
you saw in math class. And when it hits a wall, it bounces off. So, 
the 1900 signals can’t get into buildings as well. 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  And  the  reason  that’s  important  is  for  public  safe-
ty.  For  example,  the  firemen  that  were  in  the  World  Trade  Center 
on September 11th, they could have gotten the signal with a broad-
cast signal. With other higher frequencies, it doesn’t go through the 
concrete.  The  broadcasters  had  the  spectrum  about  50  years  ago, 
when  science  was  a  lot  less  sophisticated,  and  it’s  huge.  This  six 
megahertz  is  just  huge  for  each  broadcaster.  And  what  the  transi-
tion’s  actually  doing  is,  they’re  keeping  essentially  the  same 
amount  of  spectrum  they  had,  in  terms  of  their  ability  to  send  out 
a  signal,  but  it’s  just  being  used  more  efficiently,  and  the  holes  in 
the  Swiss  cheese  are  being  transferred  over,  back  to  the  public  for 
other purposes. 

Senator BURNS. OK. Now, I have a—now, should it be—anybody 
who wants to answer this—in other words, you’re asking Congress 
to  set  policy,  basically.  So,  you  say  it’s  insignificant  that  we  have 
only 11 percent of the people out there who depend on over-the-air 
broadcast, who do that now. And you said it was not necessary, for 
economic problem—economic reasons. Is that correct, Gary? 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Yes. 
Senator BURNS. OK. We are going to—we are going to, then, set 
policy  that  tells  America,  from  this  point  on—from  2008,  the  end 
of  2008—that  all  Americans  will  have  to  pay  for  their  news,  their 
sports, their entertainment—— 

Mr. SHAPIRO. No. That’s not—— 
Senator BURNS.—that used to come over—— 
Mr. SHAPIRO. Senator, with respect, that’s not what we’re saying. 
The  world  has  dramatically  changed.  Americans  now  have  the 
choice  of  six  or  seven  different  ways  of  getting  information  into 
their  home—broadcast,  cable,  cellular—the  broadcast  one  is  free; 
there  are  other  ones  that  are  relatively  free,  also.  WiFi  is  almost 
free now. But the fact is, if only one out of ten Americans are using 
over-the-air  broadcasts  to  get  a  signal,  those  Americans—you’re 
looking  at  some  types  of  policies  which  would  allow  those  Ameri-
cans  to  have  alternatives,  either  through  some  types  of  rebate,  or 
the ability to get a converter. The fact is that one out of four Amer-
ican  families  buys  a  new  TV  set  every  year  anyhow.  As  we  go  on 
five  or  10  years  from  now,  that  will  make  a  difference.  The  costs 
will go down so much, it would be incorporated. 

What  I’m  saying  is,  look  at  one  future  of  the  TV  set  which  is 
barely  used  today,  and  Congress  is  going  to  give  three  or  4  years’ 
notice to American consumers that that will be turned off. Just the 
way  people  buy  computers  today,  they  don’t  expect  them  to  be

working in five or 10 years. This is a feature. The fact is, most TV 
sets  are  used  for  cable,  satellite,  DVD,  games.  The  over-the-air 
broadcast component is barely used today. And, yes, it’s significant 
to the people that use it, but if you consider the alternatives which 
would allow those Americans that want to go out and get that con-
verter box—subsidized, low-cost, rebate, whatever it is—the ability 
to do that, I predict that that will be a very small number of Amer-
icans. 

It happened in Berlin. Berlin went over to digital television, and 
the  government  was  absolutely  shocked  that,  of  all  the  Berlin  citi-
zens  who  were  eligible  to  go  get  this  free  thing,  only  a  few  thou-
sand  out  of  the  tens  of  thousands  who  were  eligible  actually  went 
and  got  it.  They  ended  up  with  a  lot  of  converter  boxes  they 
couldn’t  get  rid  of  because  the  Germans  basically  wanted—didn’t 
care about over-the-air. 

Senator BURNS. Anybody else want to comment on that? 
Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  Senator  Burns,  if  I  could  just  say,  quickly,  I’m 
pretty  stunned  at  Mr.  Shapiro’s  cavalier  attitude  about  this.  I 
mean, I’m sure—they sell a lot of electronic equipment. They make 
money  doing  it.  I  understand  they  want  to  sell  more.  But,  by  our 
count,  there  are  80  million  sets  out  there  that  could  go  black  that 
people are using today, not for games. 

Now, I’m not trying to scare anybody. A $50 converter box would 
be  a  wonderful  thing  to  come  to  the  market,  and  we  want  public 
safety to be taken care of, but we need to do this responsibly. These 
are  TV  sets  that  people  are  actually  using,  they  say  they’re  using. 
Now,  if  the  consumer  electronics  industry  thinks  there  are  fewer, 
I  urge  you  to  have  them  indemnify  and  cover  the  cost  of  the  $50 
box  if  they’re  so  sure.  I  don’t  believe  their  numbers  are  right.  But, 
more importantly, these are sets that work today. Why should peo-
ple  have  to  pay  just  to  keep  those  sets  working?  If  they’re  going 
to—if  they  want  to  buy  a  digital  TV,  if  they  want  to  buy  a  set-top 
box,  if  they  want  to  buy  anything,  wonderful,  we’re  all  for  it.  But 
if  they  just  want  to  keep  their  television  sets  working  to  get  over- 
the-air signals, why should they have to pay? 

Senator BURNS. You want to respond to that, Mike? 
Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, Senator. 
The CHAIRMAN. This will be the last response. 
Senator BURNS. OK. 
Mr. KENNEDY. OK. Senator, all I wanted to add is that this con-
verter  box  allows  television  to  continue  to  work.  It’s  sort  of  a  fu-
ture-proof  on  your  analog  TV  set.  So,  we  are  not  here  asking  the 
Congress  to  turn  off  television.  Absolutely  not.  We’re  asking  the 
Congress  to  make  available  spectrum  for  public  safety  and  other, 
sort  of,  great  growth  wireless  services  in  the  United  States.  And 
we’re demonstrating a solution that basically takes care of the indi-
vidual viewers at—the few remaining viewers that are still looking 
at over-the-air broadcasts. So—— 

Senator BURNS. OK. 
Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. 
Senator Ensign?

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Senator ENSIGN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I want to just address a couple of things that—Mr. Kimmelman, 
you  talked  about  holding  harmless  the  consumer.  But,  you  know, 
in  all  of  the  consumers—the  fact  is,  in  this  new  world  with  this 
spectrum  freed  up,  the  spectrum  is  going  to  get  more,  not  less. 
There  are  going  to  be  so  many  more  services.  You  talk  about,  you 
know,  the  people  in  Alaska  and  Montana  that,  right  now,  cannot 
get  broadband.  OK?  And  that  digital  divide  is  going  to  get  wider 
without this spectrum being freed up. The consumer is going to get 
more. Those televisions are not going to go black. Those televisions 
just  need  to  have  converters,  and  the  converters  are—the  tech-
nology  is  very  simple  technology.  The  $50  number—you  know,  I 
can’t  tell  you  how  many  different  manufactures  I’ve  heard  from 
that  that  $50  number  is  a  very  conservative  number.  It  could  be 
even  as  low  as  $35–$40.  The  fact  that—how  many  of  our  house-
holds  today  have  computers?  They  pay  a  lot  more  than  $35–$40, 
and  they  expect  those  computers  to  last  three,  maybe  four—and 
if—some  people  will  maybe  go  five  or  6  years  if  they’re  real  anti-
quated,  but,  basically,  they’re  thinking  about  turning  those  things 
over  that  often.  A  $50,  you  know,  converter  box  is  really  not  a  lot. 
And,  for  those—and  I  believe,  you  know,  we  can  have  some  kind 
of  a  program—I’m  not  sure  exactly  what  it  will  look  like  now—for 
those  low-income  people  that  want  to  convert  over,  or  that  need  a 
little  subsidy,  or  say  they  want  a  subsidy,  put  it  out  there.  And  I 
think  that—I  agree,  I  think  the  same  thing  will  happen  as  hap-
pened in Germany. I think you put it out there and very few people 
will  take  advantage  of  it.  But,  for  those  who  need  the  satisfaction 
of that, the policymakers need that satisfaction out there, put it out 
there.  I  don’t  have  a  problem  with  that.  That’s  a  compromise  that 
we can make. 

But,  you  know,  for  people  like  us,  here  at  this  table,  or  you,  or 
the people in the audience here, we don’t need a subsidy for a little 
converter  box  for  those  televisions  that  are  analog.  I  have  eight 
TVs  in  my  house,  in  every  little  room,  and  every  one  of  those  are 
analog. OK? Now, I plan on—you know, soon, a couple of the main 
TVs—you know, going to the consumer electronics show and buying 
some things. But—— 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. SHAPIRO. We appreciate that. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  But,  you  know,  I  mean,  I—there’s  no  way  I 
should  be  getting  a  subsidy,  or  people  that  can  afford  it.  It’s  not 
an  expense  that’s  of  any  significance.  The  benefits,  though,  are 
huge. 

I  want  to  address  the  cost  aspect—not  the  cost,  but  the  revenue 
aspect  of  the  spectrum.  Mr.  Townsend,  you’ve  been  quoted  before. 
The  CBO,  I  think—Mr.  Chairman,  if  I’m  not  incorrect,  CBO  esti-
mated $10 billion on the auction. Is that about right? And that was 
interesting—about  the  date  is—during  our  listening  session,  as 
some of the people—you know, the CBO was saying that the sooner 
you  do  it,  the  less  money  you  raise—during  the  listening  session, 
some of the people made the argument that the later you do it, the 
less  money  that  is  raised  because  of  compression  technology.  Mr.

Townsend,  could  you,  one,  give  us—for  the  hard  date  that’s  been 
talked  about  today,  give  us  what  your  estimate  is,  versus  the  $10 
million  the  CBO  has  estimated,  but  also  talk  about,  whether  it’s 
sooner  or  whether  it’s  later,  what  you  think  would  happen  to  the 
revenue. I mean, I think we should listen to people that have actu-
ally been out there bidding on this auction. 

Mr.  TOWNSEND.  Our  estimate  was  $20-  to  $30  billion  sometime 
in  the  next  2  years.  That  was  based  on  comparable  transactions. 
We  went  and  looked  at  what  other  people  are  buying  and  selling 
spectrum  at  1900,  which  I  don’t  think  is  as  good  as  700.  That’s 
what they’re paying today. In terms of, is it more valuable—— 

The CHAIRMAN. What was the date, now? 
Mr. TOWNSEND. I didn’t give a specific date. It was, kind of—this 
is  what  1900  is  selling  for  right  now.  I  think  if  the  date—this  is 
a tough question, because we would like to buy that right now. And 
I  think  the  companies  we’ve  talked  to  would  like  to  buy  it  right 
now.  So,  as  the  time  goes  on,  hopefully  they’ll  be  eager  to  buy  it, 
as well in the future as they are in the past. I don’t think pushing 
it out too far is a good idea. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  So,  in  other  words,  you  don’t  think  that  it’ll  be 
more valuable into the future, and there’s a chance it could be less 
valuable. 

Mr. TOWNSEND. That’s correct. 
Senator ENSIGN. OK. 
The  idea  that—I  think,  that  needs  to  be  emphasized  today,  that 
all—virtually across the board, from what we’ve heard from people, 
is a hard date. I mean, that—I don’t know if anybody else is watch-
ing  this  thing,  or  listening.  That’s  significant  news  today,  that  vir-
tually everybody that’s testified here believes that the Nation needs 
to  go  to  a  hard  date,  from  first  responders,  to  the  manufacturers 
to  the  broadcasters,  cable.  Virtually  everybody  has  agreed  that  a 
hard  date—it’s  just  some  of  the  issues  on  how  do  we  get  to  that 
hard date, how much of a subsidy, protecting the consumers—what 
are the other issues involved—the must-carry and all of that, some 
of  the  details  that  we  can  work  out,  but  the  significance,  I  think, 
of the hearing, and, I think, why it’s so significant that you’ve held 
these hearings, Mr. Chairman and Senator Inouye, is that we have 
now  a  hard  date  to  go  toward,  and  work  out  the  details  in  the 
meantime. So, I think it’s very significant, what has happened here 
today. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. MCEWEN. Senator—could I just make a comment, Mr. Chair-

man? 

The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. 
Mr.  MCEWEN.  Your  sheriff,  Bill  Young,  in  Las  Vegas,  is  in  a— 
as you know, that’s a rapidly growing metropolitan area—he is fac-
ing  this  rapidly  growing  population  and  has  increasing  congestion 
in his radio channels there. His is one of the places that is looking 
to use 700. It’s a good example of what we’re faced with around the 
country. I just wanted to make that point. 

The CHAIRMAN. Very good. 
Senator Rockefeller? No, wait. Senator DeMint’s first.

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I’ve been trying to determine the winners and losers in this tran-
sition, and it seems like the complainers are on the consumer side, 
Mr.  Kimmelman,  the  broadcasters.  And,  as  an  old  marketing  guy, 
the first thing that comes to my mind as I listen to all of this, the 
digital  transition  could  put  the  broadcasters  back  in  business. 
What  I  just  saw  here  this  morning—and  you  sitting  at  home  with 
those  rabbit  ears,  and  you’re  getting  three  or  four  lousy  signals, 
like Senator Burns gets from his cable, somehow. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DEMINT.  But,  with  the  same  rabbit  ears,  the  same  old 
analog  TV,  now,  with  broadcasters—with  the  ability  to  broadcast 
four  or  five,  and  probably  a  lot  more,  stations,  you  could  sit  at 
home  with  20  or  30  stations  on  your  old  analog  with  your  rabbit 
ears with as good a signal as anyone else could get. And people like 
me could say, ‘‘Why in the world am I going to pay for cable?’’ Then 
we’d make the cable people sharpen their pencils in the DIRECTV. 
This  seems  like  one  of  the  greatest  opportunities  for  consumers 
that  we  could  possibly  have.  Instead  of  me  paying  $50  a  month,  I 
could pay one time for a $50 converter and get free television with 
20  or  30  stations.  It  would  put  the  national  broadcasters  back  in 
business,  instead  of  spending  millions  on  one  channel  that  they 
send to their franchisees, the franchisees would become much more 
valuable.  I  just  can’t  imagine  that  the  folks  who  are  very  much 
thinking  they’re  on  the  losing  end  were  the  ones  who  will  actually 
be in the driver’s seat with this transition. 

So,  I  appreciate  the  demonstration  today.  And  if  anything’s 
wrong  with  my  logic,  Mr.  Kimmelman  or  any  of  the  rest  of  you, 
please  let  me  know.  But  I  think  what  we’ve  heard  today,  Mr. 
Chairman, it’s time to just do it and set a date certain, and get this 
thing done. And I think the market will determine the rest. 

I yield back. 
The CHAIRMAN. Very good. Thank you. 
Now Senator Rockefeller? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McEwen, I would like to ask you this question 
together with Mr. Kimmelman. After 9/11, the world changed, and 
everybody says that happily. And I find a certain kind of awkward-
ness  in  our  discussion  of  the  date  certain  by  which  we  have  to 
produce  this  thing,  which  will  allow  first  responders,  for  example, 
to be able to get what they need in order to haul people out of the 
tragedies, or a series of tragedies, which is almost certainly coming, 
and could very well come before the date. 

Now,  the  question—my  question  is  this,  and  it’s  not  a  particu-
larly friendly one, but it bothers me a lot. Another form of national 
security in this country is our dependence upon foreign oil. Ameri-
cans  are  uniquely  geared  not  to  be  able  to  address  that  problem. 
Toyota  Motor  Companies,  which  is  the  largest  corporation  in  the 
world,  I  think,  they  decided  that  they  were  going  to  address  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00130 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

127 

problem  of  energy  efficiency  in  cars.  And  they’ve  done  it  through 
the introduction of hybrid engines, and they’re going to go on from 
there. 

Now,  there  wasn’t  any  law  in  this  country  that  said  that  people 
were going to use hybrid engines, or that by a date certain we had 
to  be  using  hybrid  engines,  but  they  started  out  cautiously,  and 
they  didn’t  introduce  that  many  of  them,  and  now  the  demand  is 
so high that it takes a year to get one of these Toyota Prius, which 
are extraordinary vehicles. 

Now,  there’s  no—as  far  as  I  know,  there’s  no  date.  They  usually 
come  in  through  California,  which  is  more  receptive  to  these 
things. And the rest of us learn. 

My  question  is,  Why  is  it  that—a  company  like  Motorola,  that 
the American industry, which has direct response to the people you 
represent,  Mr.  McEwen,  that  they  have  to  be  given  a  date  certain 
in  order  to  do  something  which  they  know  darn  well  is  in  the  na-
tional  interest?  And  the  reason  they  have  to  be  given  a  date  cer-
tain,  I  think,  is  because  otherwise  they  say,  ‘‘Well,  we’re  not  sure 
people  would  buy  our  product.’’  Well,  if  this  country  is  under 
siege—and I happen to think that it is, and I happen to think that 
most  thinking  people  think  that  it  is,  and  that  there  are  going  to 
be a variety of things happening, we’re going to really need—we’re 
going to—your folks, Mr. McEwen, are going to need this capacity. 
So,  philosophically,  would  you,  Mr.  Kennedy,  address  the  con-
cept—and  you,  Mr.  Kimmelman,  address  the  concept—of  requir-
ing—and I’m all for a date certain, but how do I know that it can’t 
be 2008? How do I know it can’t be 2007? I mean, American indus-
try can respond to anything in the world. And do you have to have 
a careful roadmap laid out for you, exactly how many people would 
buy  it,  in  what  states,  and  what  would  be  the  level  of  profit,  and 
what would be the level of purchase? 

I’m  made  very  uncomfortable  by  this.  We’re  talking  strictly  na-
tional  security  here.  And  I  think  when  national  security  is  talked 
about,  the  Congress  does  all  kinds  of  extraordinary  things,  and  so 
does  private  industry.  They  rise  to  the  occasion.  This  somehow 
seems  to  separate  itself  because  it  gets  into  spectrum,  and  it  has 
a more, sort of, cerebral context to it; and, therefore, we don’t treat 
it in the same way. But, in my judgment, it gets right at the heart 
of the matter of protecting the American people. 

Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Senator, thank you. 
I  mentioned  earlier  that—I  mean,  we  certainly,  very  much,  ap-
preciate  the  concern  over  security.  We  are  the  largest  communica-
tions  supplier  to  the  first-responder  community,  I  believe.  We’ve 
taken  some  risk  ourselves.  I  mentioned  earlier  that  we  have  al-
ready  taken  our  own  risk  to  put  some  of  these  frequencies  in  sys-
tems  we’re  selling  today.  That’s  an  effort  to  lower  the  cost  for  our 
first-responder  customers  in  the  future.  We  take  the  risk  that  we 
will  never  be  able  to  activate  those  frequencies  unless  we  have  a 
hard date, or we clear the band. 

In  terms  of  the  converter  box,  we  need  about  12  or  18  months 
to gear up production of that box. We would be selling into a dimin-
ishing  market.  You’ve  heard  Mr.  Shapiro  talk  today  about—every 
year  there  are  more  digital  televisions  in  the  market  and  fewer 
analog,  and  every  year—there’s  certainly  some  question  about  ex-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00131 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

128 

actly  what  the  number  is,  but  every  year  there  are  fewer  people 
watching over-the-air broadcasts. 

So, basically, we are not—when we talk about this converter box, 
it’s  not  an  investment  in  a  future  business;  it’s  actually  an  invest-
ment  in  something  that  we  believe  would  help  make  the  spectrum 
available for first responders and for others. 

So, it—I guess that I would have to say that we’re—I think we’re 
doing  what  we  can  and  should  do  here,  by  being  here,  by  showing 
you this box. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Kimmelman? 
Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  Yes,  Senator  Rockefeller,  I  think  for  national 
security  the  American  people  would  pay  higher  taxes,  I  think  they 
would  support  every  effort  to  enhance  our  public  safety.  What  you 
are  hearing,  though,  is  that  the  market  hasn’t  developed.  Out  of 
more  than  20  million  sets  sold  last  year,  only  a  few  million  were 
digital sets. They’re expensive, and not as many people are buying 
them.  People  are  still  buying  analog  sets,  day-in  and  day-out, 
today. It’s part of the problem. 

So,  I  think  an  orderly  transition  may  be  helpful  here,  because 
spectrum is used in different ways. Your cell phone can’t work with 
Senator McCain’s provider, probably, and vice versa. I mean, we’ve 
got—I’ve  got  an  open  market  that  has  allowed  for  multiple  uses 
and  standards,  and  the  question  is,  How  many  sets  do  you  want 
people to have to buy? The benefit here is that no one should have 
to  pay  higher  taxes,  no  one  should  have  to  pay  more,  because  you 
are—you heard, 10 billion—you heard, as much as $30 billion could 
come  in  from  auctioning  this  off  in  an  orderly  way,  hopefully  to 
promote  more  competition  and  diversity  in  the  marketplace.  So, 
there is a way to do this that enhances public safety, if done appro-
priately. 

Mr.  CALABRESE.  Senator,  if  I  could  make  one  comment,  which  is 
that—I wasn’t planning to talk on this, but I do believe it’s possible 
to clear the channels for public safety ahead of the rest. You know, 
I mentioned earlier that there’s only—out of the Nation’s 210 local 
TV  markets,  there  are  only  15—on  average,  15  high-power  TV 
channels operating on any one of those channels. But on the public- 
safety  channels—63,  64,  68,  69—there  are  far  less  than  that,  be-
tween four and ten stations operating on those channels. 

And so, the DTV transition does not necessarily need to be simul-
taneous in every market nationwide. I would think you could have 
a  rolling  transition,  where  you  clear  those—clear  the  stations  that 
are  operating  on  those  four  channels  in  the  markets  where  they’re 
located.  In  other  words,  do  the  DTV  transition  in  those  markets 
first.  It  may  mean  a  more  expensive  converter  box,  but  that  may 
be a price to pay. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr.  TOWNSEND.  Could  I  just  give  you  a  quick  answer,  from  the 

commercial side? It’s different from what these guys are saying. 

That was the question I asked, How come we can’t do this faster? 
And  the  answer  I  get  from  commercial  manufacturers  of  wireless 
broadband  equipment  is,  you  give  them  a  date,  they  can  have  this 
stuff  ready  in  12  months.  When  I—if  we  were  to  get  the  broad-
casters in here and give them truth serum, I think they would tell

you  they  could  do  it  in  18  months.  So,  if  you  guys  set  a  date,  my 
guess  is—and  you  wanted  to  crack  the  whip—you  could  have  this 
done in 18 months. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator McCain? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And,  Chief  McEwen,  earlier  today  Telemundo  said  they’d  be 
ready  to  hand  over  its  broadcast  spectrum  tomorrow.  What’s  the 
earliest date public safety would be prepared to use that spectrum? 
Mr.  MCEWEN.  We  would  begin  the  planning  immediately.  If  you 
gave  us  a  date  certain  of  tomorrow,  as  I  already  have  answered 
earlier  for  Senator  Inouye,  the—it  takes  us  about  3  years.  First  of 
all, we need to get the funding. And so, we need that date—— 

Senator MCCAIN. Let’s assume you get the funding and the date. 

How long does it take you? 

Mr.  MCEWEN.  If  I  have  the  funding  and  date  today,  it  takes 
about  2  years  before  you  can  actually  implement,  turn  on  the  sys-
tem—if I had all the planning done and the funding done, and the 
funding  committed.  So,  it’s  not  a  quick  thing.  It  doesn’t  happen 
quickly. 

Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Kimmelman, you talked about the need for 
Congress  to  compensate  over-the-air  viewers  for  the  need  to  buy 
additional  equipment—in  other  words,  a  set-top  box  of  some  kind. 
Why  do  you  believe  the  government  should  compensate  the  con-
sumers and not broadcasters or other industries? Although I think 
the broadcasters may have been amply compensated with free spec-
trum, but—— 
[Laughter.] 
Senator MCCAIN. Go ahead. 
Mr. KIMMELMAN. Senator McCain, are you suggesting we should 

compensate the broadcasters? 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  Well,  I  mean,  these  are  dislocation  costs.  And 
there is precedent in law, and you have established it before, where 
there’s  dislocation  as  you  rearrange  uses  of  spectrum,  that  you 
compensate.  In  this  case,  it  is  not  the  broadcasters  who  are 
harmed. They are getting a very valuable asset for much less, and 
possibly  as  much  as  six  stations’  worth  of  capacity  for  every  one 
they had in the past. That’s an awfully valuable—— 

Senator  MCCAIN.  How  much  would  it  cost  if  we  wanted  to  pro-
vide set-top boxes for—first of all, for every household, and then for 
every television set? 

Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  By  our  estimates,  based  on  our  surveying, 
you’re  talking  $2–$3.5  billion  out  of  the  $10–$30  billion  from  spec-
trum auctions, is what it would take to take care of everybody. And 
let  me  add  that  it’s  not  just  compensation.  Senator  Rockefeller 
raised  the  issue  of  public  safety.  If  a  cable  system  goes  out  once 
you’ve  gone  digital,  and  you’re  getting  your  broadcast  signals 
digitally,  and  there  are  still  analog  sets  out  there—Senator  Vitter 
raised  it  before—how  do  people  know  about  it?  How  do  they  find 
out? It may be valuable to keep one analog set in most households, 
with  one  of  these  set-top  boxes,  so  that  you’ll  be  able  to  find  out

about  disasters  and  what  steps  to  take,  whether  they  be  from  out-
side forces or natural disasters. 

So,  there  is  a  security—a  national  security  reason,  as  well,  to 
think about making sure consumers can have access to communica-
tions over-the-air. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  If  you  noticed—if  somebody  has  told—if  you’ve 
got an over-the-air television set that’s not connected to your cable 
or satellite in your home, and we’re going to give you a set-top box, 
are you’re going to get a run on over-the-air television sets bought? 
Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  I  seriously  doubt  it,  Senator  McCain.  I  think 
that—I  mean,  people  are  buying  what  pleases  them.  People  are 
buying  digital  boxes,  expensive  boxes,  if  they  like  them.  They’re 
buying very big sets. Some people are buying small ones. And some 
people will hold them. I recognize that people buy sets all the time. 
And  Senator  Ensign  raised  it.  We’re  for  people  buying  whatever 
they want. But a lot of people hold their sets and use them for five, 
ten,  15,  even  20  years.  And  so,  even  if  they’re  buying  new  ones, 
they’re keeping the old ones. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Is  part  of  your  argument  that  we  should  buy 
the set-top boxes because it’s—there are a lot of low-income house-
holds who can’t afford to subscribe to cable or satellite? Is that part 
of your rationale? 

Mr.  KIMMELMAN.  Absolutely,  Senator  McCain.  Of  the  16  million 
who  get  over-the-air  television  only,  the  GAO  estimates  about—at 
least  40  percent  of  them  are  lower-income.  We  heard  this  morning 
that  there  is  a  large  percentage  of  Hispanic  households  who  rely 
on  over-the-air.  A  lot  of  people  with  limited  means  still  rely  on 
over-the-air television. 

Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Townsend, in your testimony you discussed 
Aloha’s  plan  to  bring  wireless  broadband  to  rural  areas,  including 
Arizona.  There  has  been  some  speculation  that  Aloha  may  flip 
these licenses to wireless carriers once a firm date is set. Is that— 
can you comment on such speculation? 

Mr. TOWNSEND. Well, nobody’s called me and made us any offers. 
Senator  MCCAIN.  I  asked  you  if  you  would  contemplate  selling. 

It’s very valuable stuff you’ve got. 

Mr.  TOWNSEND.  I  have  to  speak  as  the  CEO  of  our  company.  I 
think we believe this stuff is about the best spectrum you can have 
for  broadband  that’s  available.  We  plan  on  deploying  wireless 
broadband  over  the  next  few  years.  If  somebody  came  and  offered 
us  eight  gazillion  dollars,  I’d  have  to  ask  our  investors  what  they 
want to do. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Mr.  Kennedy,  what’s  Motorola  doing  to  ensure 
that  public-safety  equipment  is  interoperable—not  only  interoper-
able  with  other  Motorola  equipment,  but  also  with  competitors’ 
equipment? 

Mr.  KENNEDY.  Well,  Senator,  we’re  building  equipment  to  a 
standard  called  P–25.  That  is  a  federally-recognized  standard.  It’s 
a  publicly  available  standard.  A  number  of  other  manufacturers 
build  to  that  standard,  also.  So,  we  do  have  interoperability  out 
there in the marketplace. 

Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Kimmelman, how many times have we had 

a date certain?

my—— 

Mr. KIMMELMAN. Quite a few. And one of my greatest fears, Sen-
ator McCain, is that even if you move forward, in budget reconcili-
ation, with a date certain, 2 years from now we could be here again 
with  a  date  certain,  and  things  not  having  progressed  far  enough 
and you wondering whether you need to extend that date. And that 
would not be good for the American people. 

Senator MCCAIN. If history holds true, we’ll be here 2 years later. 
I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  don’t  mean  to  be  so  cynical  in 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  thank  you  very  much.  It’s  been  a  very  in-

formative hearing, so far. 

Mr.  Shapiro,  I  want  to  get  back  to  this  TV-set  question.  Now,  I 
was  told,  categorically,  there  are  no  television  sets  manufactured 
ready  for  sale  in  the  United  States,  totally.  Now,  you  say  that 
there’s  a  large  percentage.  Aren’t  you  telling  us  that  the  compo-
nents—that consumer electronics are added to some of these boxes? 
Are  you  really  producing,  from  ground  up,  more  than  half  of  the 
television sets in this country? 

Mr. SHAPIRO. I didn’t mean to imply that, Senator. I don’t believe 
we are. As I indicated, the manufacturing has shifted rapidly from 
Mexico  to  China.  I  think  the  Mexicans  are  very  upset  about  that. 
But  the  fact  is  that  some  of  the  chips  in  some  TV  sets  are  made 
in  the  U.S.  And  I’d  be  happy  to  follow  specifically,  after  this  hear-
ing, with details. 

The CHAIRMAN. It’s very important, because I think we’re seeing 
something develop here this afternoon that I didn’t anticipate, and 
I  think  that  Senator  DeMint  has  a  point  about  the  set-top  boxes. 
Is anyone manufacturing set-top boxes in this country today? 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Well,  there  are  two  major  producers  of  set-top 
boxes:  Motorola  and  Scientific  Atlanta,  two  U.S.  companies.  And, 
indeed,  Motorola  is  one  of  the  patent-holders,  I  believe,  of  the  spe-
cific  ATSC  standard,  that  it  would  be  part  of,  not  only  every  set- 
top box, but everything having to do with HDTV getting that over- 
the-air signal. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  What’s  the  production  on  your  line,  then,  Mr. 

Kennedy? 

Mr.  KENNEDY.  Well,  that’s  right.  I  don’t  have  that  figure  avail-
able. I would just comment. Manufacturing—unfortunately, there’s 
no  easy,  simple  answer  here.  As  Mr.  Shapiro  said  earlier,  it’s  a 
complicated  answer.  I  mean,  the  design  and  development  is  often 
done in the United States. 

The CHAIRMAN. You built this box, didn’t you? 
Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, we did. Yes. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. What does it cost? 
Mr. KENNEDY. We can sell it for $50. It costs something less than 

that. Again, I don’t have that at my fingertips. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  You  know,  I’ve  got  a  place  up  in  Alaska.  We’re 
there  about  12  nights  a  year.  And  I’m  paying  twice  the  cost  of  the 
set-top  box  now  just  to  keep  that  thing  on  when  I’m  not  there.  I’d 
love to have a couple of set-top boxes. 

I  think  Senator  DeMint’s  got  a  point—we  may  have  missed  that 
point, and it’s a very good one—that many people may like to con-
vert  back  to  over-the-air  if  they  had  the  set-top  boxes.  I  wish  you 
could  tell  us  what  the  production  capability  is.  Suppose  we  picked

Mr.  McEwen’s  date,  2  years,  and  said,  you  know,  it’s  a  firm,  abso-
lute  date,  it’s  going  to  take  two-thirds  to  change  it,  or  something 
like that. Now, are there going to be boxes available? 

Mr. KENNEDY. Sure. 
The CHAIRMAN. When are they going to be available? 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Sure.  We  need  12  to  18  months  to  gear  up  a  pro-
duction  run  sufficient  to  meet  the  demand  that  we  see  out  there 
now.  Now,  if  some  of  the  Senators  are  right,  and  people  start  to 
shift  back  to  over-the-air  television,  that  would  create  more  de-
mand for the product. But when we look at the number of sets that 
are  out  there  right  now—the  number  I  have  is  actually  20  million 
sets—when  we  look  at  those  sets,  we’d  need  12  to  18  months  to 
gear up in time to meet that. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  we’re  going  to  give  a  transcript  of  this 
hearing  to  CBO  and  ask  them  to  review  their  past  findings,  in 
terms  of  the  amount  that’s  going  to  come  in  from  spectrum.  Mr. 
Townsend, you may get that call, after all. 

But  I  do  think,  if  you’re  right,  Mr.  Townsend,  and  Senator 
DeMint  has  a  point,  we  ought  to  consider  listening  to  Senator 
McCain even more and bringing the date closer, rather than taking 
it out. We’re taking it out a little bit, primarily because of revenue. 
We  had  to  have  the  revenue.  We’re  mandated  to  bring  in  $4.8  bil-
lion, in this bill. So, we have to be sure we get at least that much. 
Now,  I  think  some  of  you  ought  to  give  us  some  idea  about  how 
to help on that. 

I  do  worry  a  little  bit,  though,  about—again,  about  the  problem 
of those people who are out there who cannot afford the boxes. And 
that’s  added  onto  that  $4.8  billion.  It  has  to  be  +$4.8  billion  in 
order  to—how  much  those  boxes  will  cost,  as  I  understand  it.  So, 
I do believe we have the basis for change in this bill, and—— 

You  had  a  question  that  you  wanted  to  ask,  Senator  Burns,  is 

that right? 

Senator  BURNS.  I  just  had  one  question.  Can  we  do  the  same 

thing—sorry, I didn’t have my thing—dealing with translators? 

Mr.  KENNEDY.  Yes,  translators  would  just  be  broadcasting  an 
over-the-air  analog  signal,  so  I  think  the  same  box  would  work 
with translators. 

Senator BURNS. OK. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Now,  let  me  go  back  to  one  thing  that  bothered 
me  this  morning.  And  I  think  he’s  doing  a  fine  job  for  his  associa-
tion.  Mr.  McSlarrow,  Kyle,  said  they  preferred  to  downgrade  the 
signal  when  it  came  in  so  that  the  people  who  were  using  analog 
sets on their system could get the over-the-air broadcasting on the 
existing  sets.  Now,  is  there  anyone  manufacturing  a  box  to  go  the 
other  direction?  Is  that  possible?  Could  I  have  an  analog  set  and 
buy a box that would convert it up to the digital signal? 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  You  really  need  the  digital  TV  set,  to  appreciate 
that. An analog set would only be as good as an analog set can be. 
And,  as  was  demonstrated,  almost  anything  digital  is  better,  but 
you always have—a system is only as strong as its weakest compo-
nent,  and  today  the  weakest  component  would  be  the  analog  pic-
ture. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  But  I  can’t  buy  a  box  to  put  on  my  set  to  pick 
up—they’re  going  to  be  broadcasting  over-the-air  digital,  now.  I 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:48 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 064975 PO 00000 Frm 00136 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\64975.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

133 

can’t use that to go up, though, to that set. I can only still convert 
it back to analog for me for my set. Is that right? 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Yes. Right. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  It’s  not  technically  possible  to  go  the  other  way? 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Senator,  what  this  box  does  is,  it  takes  the  over- 
the-air  digital  signal  and  converts  it  to  an  analog  signal  so  it  can 
be displayed on a conventional analog television set. 

The CHAIRMAN. Right. 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  I’m  not  aware  of  how  you  would  go—in  a  sense, 

do that in the other direction. 

Senator  BURNS.  You’ve  already  got  a  digital  set,  so  you  don’t 

have to convert it the other way, right? 

The CHAIRMAN. No, I’ve got an analog set, but I want the digital 

signal, and not just—— 

Senator BURNS. You’re going to get it. 
The CHAIRMAN. I’m only going to get the converted signal on ana-
log,  as  I  understand  it.  Correct  me  if  I’m  wrong,  Mr.  Shapiro.  Am 
I wrong? 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Part of it, you could think of it—like, you can never 
get a—if you think back to black-and-white sets, you can never get 
color on a black-and-white set, because the system doesn’t allow it. 
You had to buy the color TV set to get the color. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  that  gets  me  back  to  the  sets,  again.  Part 
of  this  equation  has  to  be  that  we  stop  sets  coming  in  that  are 
going to require people to convert. What is wrong with the sugges-
tion  that  was  made  that  we  require  anyone  producing  a  set  after, 
say—what?—November 15th in this country—or selling them—has 
to have a chip in it that converts it? What’s wrong with that? 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  I  think  what’s  wrong  with  that  is,  you  take  a  $70 
13-inch set, and you would add another $150 or so of cost to it, and 
consumers would go in and say, ‘‘Why—what happened to the price 
of the TV sets?’’ 

The CHAIRMAN. The chips only—the chips in this thing don’t cost 

that much money. 

Mr. SHAPIRO. In three or 4 years, they may not; but today to add 
that  integrated  feature  to  a  TV  set,  it  costs  a  minimum  of  $100  to 
$200, if not more. It’s a very sophisticated—almost first- or second- 
generation process now. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  how  do  we  get  away  from  the  point 

that—— 

Senator BURNS. Stick the box in. 
Mr. SHAPIRO. But the box costs that amount of money, and some-

one has to pay—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We’re  going  to  pass  a  law  that  says  that  this  is 
the  absolute  drop-dead  date.  But,  meanwhile,  the  country  gets 
flooded with these things that won’t—that are going to require set- 
top boxes to enjoy the signal. 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Yes, but nine out of ten of those are not even being 

used for analog—for over-the-air signal. 

The CHAIRMAN. You said one of our four people buying a new TV 

Mr. SHAPIRO. One out of four families every year, if not more. 
The CHAIRMAN. I’ve got to tell you, they must be producing kids, 

then, because they’ve still got their sets out there, don’t they?

134 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Well, my point—— 
The CHAIRMAN. I mean, these sets are just another added-on set 
to  the  analog  area,  is  what  I’m  telling  you;  they’re  not  coming  in 
digital. 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Well,  now  we’re  selling  more  digital  sets  than  we 
are  analog,  and  that  trend  is  going  to  increase.  If  Congress  sets  a 
hard  deadline,  that’ll  increase  even  quicker  and  more.  And  once 
Congress is—once we’re able to say, ‘‘The law is that these sets will 
no  longer  get  a  signal  after  2008,’’  the  consumer’s  going  to  start 
thinking about it. Today, forcing consumers to think about it, when 
they  see—you  know,  they  see  two  sets  side  by  side,  one  is  great, 
with a big picture, but it’s $700 more than the old analog one—but 
they may want to use that analog one for a DVD, for video games. 
That’s what these sets are really being used for. Broadcasting now 
is a very minor use of a television set. 

The CHAIRMAN. I’ve told this to my colleagues before, I don’t like 
to  confess  my  stupidity,  but  I  was  convinced,  a  year  ago,  that  the 
set I bought was digital. It’s analog. 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Well, I would like to—— 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. Right on the face, it says ‘‘digital,’’ but it’s not— 

it’s digital-ready, they told me. 

Mr. SHAPIRO. Well, once you experience HDTV, I think you’ll re-

member it, because it has such a great big wide picture. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  understand  that,  but  I  don’t  want  that  experi-
ence  for  other  people,  buying  a  set  who  think  it’s  digital  and  it’s 
not. 

Senator  BURNS.  No,  but,  listen,  I’ll  tell  you  what,  there  is  a  dif-
ference, though, Senator, between a digital TV set and a high-defi-
nition television set. Remember that. 

The CHAIRMAN. What would it take to have people agree they put 
that  on  the  set?  I  believe,  if  we  set  a  date—let’s  take  the  original 
date,  2006,  OK?  Suppose  we  said—the  place—the  country  would 
still be flooded with those sets that won’t pick up the signal. 

Mr. SHAPIRO. They would be—that would allow manufacturers to 
put  labels  saying,  ‘‘As  of  2006,  that  you  will  not  get  a  signal  on 
this, and, essentially, you’re buying a monitor, you’re buying some-
thing usable for video games, or for cable, or satellite.’’ That would 
allow that. 

But  we  are  supporting  a  hard  deadline  of  almost  any  date,  as 
long  as  there’s  a  hard  deadline.  We  want  to  see  that.  That  allows 
us to tell consumers that Congress has said this will happen. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye has a question. 
Senator  INOUYE.  I  think  we  can  reach  certain  conclusions.  First, 
every member of the panel and the Committee has used the words 
‘‘deadline,’’ ‘‘hard date,’’ ‘‘drop-dead’’—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator INOUYE.—or what have you. Second, I think we can con-
clude  that  whatever  is  involved  here  is  complex  and  complicated. 
And  I’m  just  wondering,  do  most  of  the  people  of  the  United 
States  realize  what’s  happening  in  this  room?  Do  they  know  that 
we’re  discussing  conversion?  Are  they  prepared  for  it?  If  we  sud-
denly thrust upon them a deadline, what’s going to happen?

Senator INOUYE. We’re a bunch of politicians here. 
Mr.  TOWNSEND.—you  raise  an  extremely  valid  point.  I  don’t  be-
lieve  the  American  people  have  any  idea  what  is  being  discussed, 
and  the  significance  of  it,  and  what  it’ll  mean  for  them.  And  so,  I 
believe Mr. Lawson, this morning, indicated that this needs a kind 
of Y2K preparedness. I wouldn’t want to overstate it, but there are 
a  lot  of  pieces  that  have  to  come  together  for  people  to  be  able  to 
feel  comfortable  with  changing  how  they  receive  signals  on  their 
television set, and knowing how much it’s going to cost them. 

Senator  INOUYE.  If  what  you  say  is  correct,  should  we  involve 

ourselves in some educational process? 

Mr. KIMMELMAN. Absolutely, Senator Inouye. I think if the Com-
mittee  moves  forward  with  legislation,  if  you  set  a  date,  if  you  go 
forward, it’s incumbent upon all of us to come together with an in-
formational  program.  And  it’s  really  all  the  industry.  I  know  it’s 
not  their  motivation,  but,  in  reality,  they’ll  make  a  lot  of  money 
selling  a  lot  of  equipment  here,  and  someone’s  going  to  pay  for  it. 
Whether  it’s  consumers  or  someone  else,  I  don’t  know.  And  so,  it’s 
really incumbent upon all of us to work together to make sure peo-
ple are well informed, and they know that what they buy will work 
and how it’ll work. 

Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Senator  Inouye,  we  would  welcome  your  involve-
ment.  We’ve  spent  several  years,  and  several  million  dollars  edu-
cating the public about this, and, indeed, nine out of ten American 
adults  are  now  aware  of  the  terms  ‘‘DTV’’  and  ‘‘HDTV,’’  and  over 
half  intend  that  their  next  TV-set  purchased  will  be  digital  tele-
vision. 

But, while we’ve been out there promoting over-the-air television 
and broadcasting, and having websites for how to buy an antenna, 
and  doing  all  these  things,  the  broadcasters  have  been  almost  to-
tally  silent  on  this;  and,  instead,  they’ve  focused  on  regulating 
cable,  and  regulating  satellite  and  regulating  us.  And  we’ve  been 
asking  the  broadcasters  to  step  up  and  promote  free  over-the-air 
broadcasting,  and  they  have  not.  And  I  think  this  would  be  an  ex-
cellent  opportunity—I  hope,  as  a  part  of  any  legislation,  there  is  a 
mandate that they do that. If they’re going to get this great public 
spectrum,  they  should  be  out  there  promoting  the  fact  that  there’s 
free  over-the-air  broadcasting,  and  that  there’s  HDTV,  and  they 
have not done that, to this point. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. McEwen? 
Mr.  MCEWEN.  Yes,  I  think—you  know,  I  think  the  time  has 
come. And, you know, I would encourage you to keep on the think-
ing  that  you’re  going  down  this  road,  and  that  is  that—you  know, 
what  we  were  trying  to  say,  and  we’ve  been  saying  for  years,  is 
that,  in  1997,  when  you  mandated  that  we  were  going  to  get  this 
spectrum,  if  you  had  made  the  decision  then  that  in  5  years  there 
wouldn’t  be  any  more  analog  sets  built,  that  would  have  stopped 
the problem. We wouldn’t be having this problem. And the problem 
is, today you’re re-examining that same issue. 

If  you  don’t  make  that  decision  sooner  or  later,  it’s  going  to  just 
continue to be a problem. I mean, the education is a very important 
issue, I agree with that, but you can’t start educating until you can 
tell  people  what  to  expect.  And  they  don’t  know  what  to  expect 
without you making that date certain.

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  think  it  should  have  a  double-whammy,  and 
that  is,  we  won’t  allow  a  set  to  be  sold  after  a  certain  date  that’s 
not  digital,  but  we  won’t  provide  a  set-top  box  for  any  TV  that’s 
bought  after  a  date  closer  to  us.  I  just  don’t  think  we  should  do 
that. 

Let me—— 
Mr.  SHAPIRO.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  FCC  has  done  that.  There  are 
dates that say you cannot sell an analog set, alone. And we are re-
specting those dates. 

The CHAIRMAN. They did that, but I don’t think it’s very enforce-

The CHAIRMAN. Well, we want to bring it really closer to us. 
Let me take a last comment and privilege. 
You  mentioned  the  German  experience.  Just  keep  in  mind  that 
my  state  alone  is  bigger  than  Italy,  Germany,  France,  and  Spain. 
We’ve got a different country here. You can learn much from what 
goes on on the continent. I really think we ought to think very seri-
ously  about  what  happens  to  rural  America,  in  terms  of  this  legis-
lation.  And  we,  all  of  us,  represent  portions  of  rural  America.  So, 
I think we will reflect it in the Committee. 

Anyone else have any questions? 
Yes, Mr. Kennedy? 
Mr.  KENNEDY.  Senator,  I  just  want  to  add  to  Senator  Inouye’s 
discussion  about  education.  I  think  that’s  very  important.  I  think 
that,  to  date,  the  debate  has  been  mischaracterized.  It  has  been 
mischaracterized  largely,  I  have  to  say,  by  the  broadcasters  as 
‘‘turning  off  television.’’  I  think  what  we’ve  tried  to  show  today  is 
that  it’s  not  about  turning  off  television;  it’s  about  releasing  spec-
trum  for  commercial  and  first-responder  purposes.  TV  viewers, 
over-the-air  viewers,  with  the  right  converter  box,  are  going  to  get 
more  choice,  they’re  going  to  get  better  pictures.  So,  I  think  to  un-
derscore  the  educational  need  here  to,  kind  of,  make  sure  every-
body understands what the real debate is about. 

Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. I hope you will be willing to answer questions of 

some of the people who have got very technical questions. 

Mr. Townsend? 
Mr.  TOWNSEND.  Senator,  you  know,  your  point  about  the  rural 
areas,  I  think,  has  been  a  little  misconstrued  in  some  circles.  I 
think the rural areas are going to be the big benefactors here. And 
the reason is, even though everybody thinks they’re the people who 
receive over-the-air television, that’s not true. The rural areas gen-
erally  have  a  much  lower  number  of  over-the-air  television  sets 
than  the  metropolitan  areas  do,  because  of  the  satellite  receivers. 
For  example,  in  Montana,  which  I  think  you  would  definitely  clas-
sify  as  rural,  there  are—under  10  percent  of  the  over-the-air  sets 
are receiving TV over-the-air. 

I  think  the  big  benefit’s  going  to  be—taking  Montana  or  Alaska, 
or any of these states, really—is that if you do the DTV transition,

you’re going to have very few rural people affected by the over-the- 
air  sets,  and  tons  of  them  able  to  get  rural  broadband.  And  so, 
they’re going to be—they’re not going to have much downside from 
watching TV, but they’re going to have an enormous upside by get-
ting in rural broadband. 

The CHAIRMAN. I hope you’re right. Those rich ranchers up there 
in  Montana,  they  can  afford  it.  I’m  not  sure  the  reindeer  herders 
can.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JERRY K. ROSE, PRESIDENT, 

RELIGIOUS VOICE IN BROADCASTING 

Multicast must-carry in digital television (DTV) is the single most important legis-
lative  issue  for  full-power  religious  broadcasters  in  our  country.  As  the  Committee 
considers introducing a DTV bill this session, we would like to encourage you to in-
clude  a  mandatory  multicast  must-carry  provision  to  ensure  non-major  network  af-
filiated, small, independent, religious and minority broadcasters maintain a propor-
tionate voice in the digital television landscape. 

In  this  regard,  the  following  testimony  will  provide  insight  on  four  important 
issues  raised  during  the  multicast  must-carry  debate;  offer  detailed  information  re-
garding the financial hardships being faced by RVB stations working to comply with 
the  government  mandated  build-out  to  DTV;  and  supply  information  on  the  types 
of  programming  RVB  stations  air  and  produce  and  their  programming  plans  for 
multicasting in DTV. 

First,  although  cable  operators  have  invested  millions  to  build  their  systems  out 
to  digital,  broadcasters  have  also  invested  millions,  sometimes  up  to  75  percent  of 
their  operating  budget,  to  meet  the  minimum  DTV  requirements  mandated  by  the 
Federal Government. However, cable operators made their decision based on a busi-
ness  model  that  will  reap  significant  benefits;  while  small,  independent  and  reli-
gious full-power stations were mandated to make this burdensome investment, even 
in  circumstances  where  the  business  model  was  not  a  profitable  venture  for  their 
stations. To add to the dilemma, many religious broadcasters will experience a dilu-
tion of their voice when they become one channel out of 800–1000 on a digital cable 
system  instead  of  one  of  100  channels  on  an  analog  system.  Multicast  must-carry 
offers  these  broadcasters  an  opportunity  to  maintain  a  proportionate  voice  in  the 
digital television environment. 

Second,  broadcasters  are  not  asking  cable  operators  to  carry  any  additional  spec-
trum,  not  a  single  MHz  more,  than  is  currently  being  carried  on  their  analog  sys-
tems.  Moreover,  cable  operators  can  now  compress  each  broadcaster’s  6  MHz  of 
spectrum into 3 MHz on their digital cable systems, even with multicast must-carry, 
thereby  reducing  by  50  percent  their  carriage  requirements,  and  are  not  required 
to  carry  broadcast  channels  beyond  one-third  of  their  capacity.  In  their  latest  DTV 
position  paper  dated  May  26,  2005,  the  Christian  Broadcasting  Association  quoted 
John  Alchin,  CFO  of  Comcast,  as  stating:  ‘‘We  can  turn  70–80  analog  channels  into 
1000–1600  digital  channels  with  15–20  compression  with  virtually  no  investment’’.1 
Therefore,  cable  operators  will  not  face  debilitating  capacity  issues  if  required  to 
carry  broadcaster’s  multicast  signals.  This  is  especially  significant  considering  that 
most  cable  operators  have  among  the  highest  profit  margins—40  percent  and 
more—of all telecommunications industries in the country. 

Third,  while  RVB  takes  no  position  regarding  the  recent  consolidation  of  multi- 
media  conglomerates,  media  concentration  has  contributed  to  an  increase  in  hori-
zontal  and  vertical  integration.  Greater  integration  exists  today  than  before  the 
1992  Cable  Act,  which  makes  multicast  must-carry  increasingly  important  to  pre-
serve the government’s interest in free over-the-air local broadcast television, infor-
mation from a multiplicity of sources and fair competition in the television program-
ming  market;  issues  cited  by  the  Supreme  Court  as  justification  for  must-carry  in 
Turner  Broadcasting  System,  Inc.  v.  FCC.  We  strongly  believe  there  should  be  a 
place for broadcasters who are not affiliated with major media conglomerates in the 
digital television landscape. 

This is especially important given that RVB stations provide the type of local and 
community  focused  programming  that  Congress  intended  to  preserve.  For  example, 
WLMB–TV  40  in  Toledo,  Ohio,  airs  a  weekly  program  entitled,  Find  a  Local 
Church.  The  program  features  various  places  of  worship  in  the  local  Toledo  region

so  that  those  who  are  new  to  the  area  can  familiarize  themselves  with  the  region’s 
local churches. KSCE–TV 38 in El Paso, Texas, offers several hours of Spanish-lan-
guage programming daily to serve their large Hispanic community with local public 
interest  and  education  programs.  They  also  have  3  hours  of  Arabic-language  pro-
gramming  available  on  a  weekly  basis,  including  a  women’s  interest  program. 
KTLN–TV  68  in  San  Francisco,  California,  focuses  on  Korean,  Chinese,  and  Span-
ish-language  programming  to  serve  the  diverse  demographic  of  that  area.  KTLN  is 
also  part  of  the  Total  Living  Network  in  Aurora,  Illinois,  which  produces  approxi-
mately  700  hours  of  local  programming  yearly,  including  Newsmakers,  a  program 
covering  current  events  of  importance  to  the  local  Chicago  communities.  (More  ex-
amples of programming aired and produced by RVB stations and their programming 
plans for multicasting in digital television can be found in the Appendix.) 

Cable operators argue that market forces should determine which broadcasters re-
ceive cable carriage of their multicast signals. In a perfect world, the most ‘‘compel-
ling’’ programming would receive carriage and a government mandate would be un-
necessary. However, recent events indicate that this is not always the case. For ex-
ample,  during  the  ‘‘two-dish’’  satellite  debate  in  Congress  last  session,  it  was  re-
vealed  that  satellite  television  providers  were  systematically  placing  some  highly 
rated  stations,  including  Spanish-language  and  religious  broadcasters,  on  a  second 
dish which reached a substantially diminished viewing audience. Satellite providers 
offered  no  clear  or  logical  explanation  for  this  systematic  practice  and  later  moved 
these  stations  to  the  first  dish  when  questioned  about  this  practice  by  Members  of 
Congress. 

Furthermore,  operators  found  that  a  market-based  approach  did  not  work  for 
cable  channels  under  the  proposed  a  la  carte  structure  and  informed  the  Hill  that 
many  cable  programmers  would  not  survive  without  bundling  that  assured  cable 
carriage  for  certain  channels.  Cable  argued  that  their  business  plan  could  not  be 
sustained under an a la carte structure that would allow viewers to pick and choose 
programmers  and  that  the  market  could  not  accurately  determine  what  program-
ming  was  considered  compelling  by  viewers  across  America.  Yet,  in  the  case  of 
multicast  must-carry,  cable  operators  are  urging  Congress  to  let  the  market  deter-
mine  which  broadcasters  should  receive  carriage  of  their  multicast  signals,  pri-
marily  because  they  own  competing  programming.  Arguably,  religious,  small,  inde-
pendent,  Spanish-language  and  non-major  networks  and  broadcasters  are  at  a  big-
ger disadvantage than cable channels in seeking carriage of their multicast signals. 
Cable’s  positions  on  these  two  issues  are  inconsistent  and  would  result  in  the  dis-
parate  treatment  of  broadcasters  and  would  be  detrimental  to  small,  independent 
and religious full-power broadcasters. 

The original intent of must-carry in the 1992 Cable Act was to ensure that small, 
independent and non-major media affiliated broadcasters would continue to provide 
valuable  diversity  of  programming  to  our  nation.  As  we  transition  to  digital  tele-
vision,  multicast  must-carry  will  help  small,  independent,  minority  and  religious 
broadcasters  maintain  their  voices  and  allow  them  to  continue  serving  niche  mar-
kets  with  diverse  local  and  community-focused  programming.  We  would  encourage 
the  Committee  to  consider  these  issues  as  the  DTV  bill  develops  this  session  and 
ask that it include multicast must-carry. 
Financial  Hardship  Information  of  RVB  Stations  Working  To  Comply  With 

the Government Mandated DTV Build-Out 

RVB  stations  are  experiencing  significant  financial  hardships  as  a  result  of  the 
government  mandated  DTV  build-out.  The  government  mandated  DTV  build-out 
disproportionately affects small and independent broadcasters and threatens our vi-
ability. 

RVB  stations  did  not  seek  Federal  support  for  digital  television,  nor  did  we  com-
mit  to  airing  high  definition  programming  in  exchange  for  digital  spectrum.  Major 
networks like ABC, NBC, FOX and CBS can more easily finance the transition and 
leverage  their  assets  to  negotiate  strong  retransmission  consent  agreements  and 
cable  carriage  for  their  secondary  networks,  making  DTV  a  profitable  undertaking 
for  their  companies.  Small,  independent  and  non-major  network  affiliated  broad-
casters  lack  the  power  to  negotiate  for  cable  distribution  of  our  multiple  digital 
broadcast  signals  and  need  multicast  must-carry  to  retain  a  proportionate  voice  in 
digital  television.  In  the  absence  of  multicast  must-carry,  major  networks  and 
vertically integrated cable channels are the beneficiaries of a Federal DTV mandate 
that  places  smaller  broadcasters  at  a  federally  imposed  competitive  disadvantage. 
With the foresight that forced conversion would require debilitating financial invest-
ments, dilution of our voices and reduced services for our viewers, RVB would have 
opposed Federal regulations for an unfunded digital television mandate.

Promoting  diversity  of  viewpoints  and  choices  in  the  television  medium  is  an  im-
portant  government  interest.  A  regulatory  environment  that  gives  small  and  local 
broadcasters  the  opportunity  to  maintain  existing  local  operations,  while  simulta-
neously  fostering  growth  and  a  proportionate  voice  in  digital  television,  preserves 
a basic tenant of American communication policy—promoting widespread dissemina-
tion  of  information  from  a  multiplicity  of  sources.  The  impeditive  costs  associated 
with  the  digital  television  transition,  for  non-major  network  affiliated  broadcasters 
without  the  assurance  of  multicast  must-carry,  will  continue  to  disproportionately 
affect our ability to function, considering many of us are only marginally successful 
under an analog business model. 

The  challenges  of  the  digital  transition  have  caused  some  broadcasters  to  sell 
their stations, and others will falter because of financial difficulties associated with 
the uncertainty of digital must-carry requirements. Multicast must-carry is the sin-
gle most important issue facing RVB stations as we plan for future broadcast oper-
ations in digital television.

Opportunities for Independent Broadcasters To Mitigate Costs 

The Government mandated digital build-out imposes precarious financial burdens 
on  non-major  network  affiliated  broadcasters  forced  to  finance  higher  electricity 
bills, maintenance fees, engineering and attorney costs, insurance premiums, phone 
bills, digital equipment and additional supplies and services necessary to meet DTV 
operating deadlines. Depending on the market location, RVB broadcasters have cur-
rently  expended  anywhere  from  $50,000  to  $4.5  million  to  convert  their  stations, 
and are expected to spend approximately $156,000 to $5.5 million more. 

Independent  stations  in  the  same  market  as  network-affiliated  broadcasters  may 
outlay  similar,  but  disproportionate,  costs  during  the  digital  conversion.  Expendi-
tures  by  RVB  stations  typically  cover  only  the  necessities  of  conversion  but  con-
stitute  a  large  portion  of  total  operating  revenues  and  a  significant  drain  on  re-
sources.  Following  the  digital  conversion,  independent  stations  will  have  spent  re-
sources  equivalent  to  major  network  stations  but  will  continue  to  be  systematically 
refused  MSO  carriage  of  our  multiple  signals.  We  will  not  be  able  to  use  advanced 
digital technology to defray or recoup our investments without must-carry. However, 
major network affiliated broadcasters are currently striking deals for carriage of all 
their signals including secondary network channels by using their leverage as large 
multi-tiered  media  conglomerates.  Many  RVB  stations  will  not  be  able  to  meet  fi-
nancial  obligations  resulting  from  digital  television  investments  without  assurance 
that our multicast signals will be distributed through cable. 

Table 1 reflects the to-date expenditures made by some RVB stations in prepara-
tion  for  the  digital  transition.  Also  listed  are  estimated  future  costs  necessary  to 
complete the conversion and operating costs for the year 2003.

The figures in Table 1 vary from market-to-market and the extent of actual build- 
out,  but  share  the  important  commonality  of  an  undue  burden.  The  best  use  of  the 
digital spectrum for RVB stations will likely be a combination of high-definition and 
standard  definition  programming  with  multicasting.  Each  community  will  have  a 
custom planned digital television model based on its local needs. A mixture of spec-
trum usage will allow stations to develop new and expanded community service pro-
grams,  recoup  expenses  imposed  by  the  government’s  unfunded  digital  television 
mandate,  and  ensure  that  local  communities  continue  receiving  important,  demo-
graphically  tailored  and  inspirational  programming  from  a  multiplicity  of  sources. 
All RVB member stations have reduced operating costs to fund the digital transi-
tion by limiting or eliminating valuable programming. Such decisions are among the 
most  difficult  to  make.  Our  stations  are  struggling  with  the  burden  of  developing 
digital  programming  plans  in  an  uncertain  regulatory  environment,  while  simulta-
neously laboring to finance the costs of digital build-out. Multicast must-carry is the 
lynchpin to our viability. 
Multicast  Must-Carry  Is  Necessary  To  Create  Parity  Between  Analog  and  Digital 

MSO Carriage Requirements 

Must-carry  legislation  was  enacted  to  protect  small,  independent  and  non-major 
network  affiliated  local  broadcast  voices  that  were  being  denied  carriage  by  cable 
operators.  The  Commission’s  ‘‘primary  video’’  ruling  adversely  affects  the  balance 
created  in  the  1992  Cable  Act  and  unduly  burdens  smaller  broadcasters  struggling 
with the transition. 

Recent  reports  indicate  that  major  broadcast  networks  have  either  signed  or  are 
negotiating  multicast  carriage  agreements  for  their  digital  signals.  Major  networks 
have  historically  used  their  leverage  to  negotiate  successful  retransmission  consent 
agreements  and  multicast  carriage  deals  are  expected.  Major  network  affiliated 
broadcasters,  including  their  commonly  owned  secondary  networks,  have  a  distinct 
advantage in developing digital television business and programming plans because 
they can capitalize on advanced technology with the understanding that cable opera-
tors will carry all their new programming streams. 

For  instance,  Viacom,  which  owns  CBS,  possesses  the  leverage  to  negotiate  car-
riage  of  its  broadcast  and  cable  channels,  including  MTV,  through  its  commonly 
owned  cable  networks  that  are  affiliated  with  cable  distributors.  We  are  not  affili-
ated  with  profitable  and  dominant  major  network  broadcasters  that  can  negotiate 
multicast  carriage  of  secondary  networks,  like  NBC  and  Telemundo  or  CBS  and 
UPN; while leveraging their main broadcast channel feed. As independent stations, 
we  would  hope  that  our  programming,  public  services  and  audience  loyalty  would 
prompt  cable  to  carry  our  multicast  signals.  However,  this  has  not  been  the  case 
and in instances where local cable systems have entertained our requests for dialog 
on  digital  carriage,  we  have  been  informed  that  their  corporate  offices,  located  in 
distant cities, have policies against carriage of independent station’s multicast chan-
nels. 

Regardless of our extensive record of public service and community support, inde-
pendent full-power stations will continue to be systematically rebuffed when seeking 
carriage  of  multiple  signals  in  the  absence  of  a  FCC  mandate.  However,  trends  in 
digital  carriage  requirements  show  that  multicasting  is  an  important  component  to 
the  future  of  digital  television.  In  order  to  compete  in  digital  television  with  major 
networks, their affiliates and other cable programmers, we must be able to maintain 
parity in the television medium.

Evidence of RVB Stations Experiencing Financial Difficulty Is Pandemic 

143 

The following are examples of RVB member experiences with the digital television 

transition: 

Mr.  Jamey  Schmitz  of  WLMB–TV  40  in  Toledo,  Ohio,  runs  a  nonprofit,  commer-
cial  television  station  primarily  funded  by  viewer  contributions  with  additional  fi-
nancial  support  from  advertising  revenues.  To-date,  they  have  incurred  DTV  costs 
of  $412,000,  $12,000  of  which  was  expended  on  electricity  alone.  WLMB  estimates 
that $156,000 is necessary to complete the transition. Moreover, if the transition ex-
tends beyond the 2006 target date, WLMB will be required to replace a dated analog 
transmitter at a cost of $500,000—a significant investment for this station. 

WLMB has been on the air for 5 years and won the prestigious National Religious 
Broadcaster’s Television Station of the Year award for 2 consecutive years, 2003 and 
2004.  The  station  is  a  valuable  part  of  the  Ohio  community  because  of  its  locally 
produced  shows  that  reflect  the  unique  characteristics  of  the  market.  WLMB  and 
its  viewers  were  disappointed  when  the  station  suspended  plans  to  invest  in  new 
community-based  programming,  including  popular  local  high  school  sports,  due  to 
the financial burdens of the digital transition. WLMB is contemplating infomercials 
as  a  source  of  revenue;  although  Mr.  Schmitz  and  his  colleagues  would  prefer  to 
focus  on  the  public  service  and  community  programming  that  continue  to  make 
WLMB a successful, valuable and beloved community broadcast station. 

Ms. Grace Rendall of KSCE–TV 38 in El Paso, Texas, estimates that their annual 
operating  expenses  for  their  digital  TV  station  will  exceed  $500,000  per  year.  This 
figure  is  in  addition  to  their  analog  expenses  and  significantly  higher  than  KSCE’s 
2003  total  gross  revenues  of  $360,541.  As  a  non-commercial  station  dependent  on 
viewer contributions, KSCE has already borrowed $15,000 and anticipates financing 
an  additional  $1.6  million  to  comply  with  the  government-mandated  build-out.  Ms. 
Rendall  has  encountered  resistance  in  securing  additional  financing  because  of  the 
perception  that  declining  revenue  will  be  realized  from  the  digital  operations  of 
KSCE without cable carriage of their multicast signals. 

KSCE has engaged outside help to supplement its small staff and identify outside 
funding  sources,  conduct  audits  for  grant  proposals  and  hire  personnel  to  plan  and 
implement  the  digital  conversion.  The  financial  difficulties  KSCE  is  facing  have 
caused  an  indefinite  delay  of  plans  for  developing  new  and  expanded  free  program-
ming. KSCE is a small station suffering from a loss of valuable time, resources and 
assets which they are investing to meet the FCC’s imposed digital deadlines. 

Mr.  Ken  Mikesell’s  digital  stations,  WTGL–DTV  53  and  WLCB–DTV  46  in  Or-
lando, Florida, will cost an additional $75,000 per year to operate, in addition to an-
nual  debt  servicing  and  programming  costs  associated  with  the  transition.  An  in-
vestment of $5.5 million more is necessary for DTV completion. Borrowing funds for 
this  venture  is  difficult  because  lenders  express  concerns  about  the  negative  finan-
cial implications of independent broadcasters’ ability to service debts without a clear 
digital  multicast  must-carry  requirement.  Mr.  Mikesell’s  financial  struggles  have 
forced  him  to  downsize  from  25  to  14  employees.  He  continues  to  seek  funding 
sources to avoid disenfranchising his remaining employees and the elderly, minority 
and  poor  communities  of  Orlando,  that  comprise  the  majority  of  his  viewing  audi-
ence, and rely on the important local programming his stations provide. 

Mr.  Bob  D’Andrea,  Chairman  of  Christian  Television  Network  (CTN)  and  owner 
of  Florida  stations  WCLF–TV  22  in  Tampa  Bay;  WHBR–TV  33  in  Pensacola; 
WRXY–TV  49  in  Fort  Myers;  and  WFGC–TV  61  in  West  Palm  Beach,  expects  his 
annual  operating  expenses  to  increase  an  additional  $166,000  for  DTV  operations. 
Mr. D’Andrea has borrowed $5 million of the $7 million currently necessary for the 
digital  build-out  of  his  Florida  stations,  and  estimates  financing  another  $700,000 
for  completion.  The  Christian  Television  Network  (CTN)  is  currently  airing  both 
analog and digital signals from their stations and requested FCC authority to cease 
analog broadcasting operations to reduce costs. The FCC denied their request, forc-
ing CTN to implement across-the-board cutbacks. 

Mr.  Mike  Smith’s  digital  operations  for  WLFG–TV  68  in  Grundy,  Virginia  and 
WAGV–TV  44  in  Harlan,  Kentucky,  have  increased  annual  operating  expenditures 
by  $150,000.  Moreover,  maintaining  the  new  digital  equipment  requires  specialized 
engineering  costs  of  $100,000  during  the  first  year  and  $120,000  for  subsequent 
years.  Insurance  for  the  WLFG  and  WAGV  buildings  and  their  new  digital  equip-
ment, and higher phone bills associated with the remote control transmitter that op-
erates  from  the  studio,  have  placed  major  financial  burdens  on  Mr.  Smith’s  oper-
ations. In an attempt to mitigate costs, Mr. Smith began airing infomercials, which 
he removed after receiving negative feedback from his viewer base. He continues to 
look  for  creative  cost  cutting  and  financing  arrangements  to  support  his  broadcast 
operations,  but  is  experiencing  significant  difficulties  and  sees  multicasting  as  the

only  way  to  maintain  and  increase  his  viewing  audience  and  sustain  a  viable  busi-
ness model for his digital stations. 

Dr.  James  Thompson  has  borrowed  $400,000  to  build  out  of  his  stations  WATC– 
TV  57  Atlanta,  GA,  and  WGGS–TV  16  Greenville,  SC,  and  must  acquire  an  addi-
tional  $2  million  to  complete  construction.  An  annual  debt  service  of  $75,000  plus 
a yearly increase of $12,000 in expenses for DTV operations has forced Dr. Thomp-
son  to  contemplate  infomercials  to  meet  rising  costs,  a  measure  he  hopes  to  avoid 
through increased programming revenues from multicasting. 
Without a Multicast Must-Carry Requirement, the Financial Burdens Imposed by the 
DTV  Transition  Will  Perpetuate  the  Loss  of  Independent  Religious  Broadcast 
Voices and a Diversity of Viewpoints 

When  the  DTV  build-out  was  announced,  some  family-friendly  and  spiritual 
broadcasters  sold  their  stations  because  the  costs  of  providing  DTV  services  were 
not  feasible  without  the  assurance  of  cable  carriage  for  digital  signals.  The  mission 
of  religious  broadcasters  is  unique,  in  that  RVB  member  stations  are  not  driven  by 
profit maximization. Our success is measured by the positive impact we have on our 
local  communities  and  viewing  audience,  and  we  will  continually  resist  compro-
mising programming choices aimed at serving our loyal constituencies. 

However,  small  and  independent  stations  with  limited  resources  will  not  survive 
a  DTV  transition  that  imposes  severe  financial  burdens  without  multicast  require-
ments  for  cable  operators.  The  systematic  refusal  by  cable  operators  to  carry  the 
multicast signals of smaller independent broadcast stations has resulted in system-
atic  refusals  by  financial  institutions  to  invest  in  our  digital  businesses.  Our  sta-
tions simply cannot survive in a digital television world where the Federal Govern-
ment  places  us  at  a  non-functional  competitive  disadvantage.  Should  multicast 
must-carry not be enacted in the near term, America will permanently lose valuable 
independent television voices—and these stations will never be part of the television 
landscape again. 

As  the  transition  to  digital  television  continues  to  offer  viewers  new  and  innova-
tive  programming,  it  is  essential  that  there  remain  a  place  for  small,  independent 
and  non-major  network  affiliated  broadcasters.  It  should  be  noted  that  these  sta-
tions  face  tremendous  difficulties  in  seeking  to  get  their  multicast  signals  carried 
even  when  they  offer  compelling  local  programming  and  possess  a  strong  and  loyal 
audience. 

In  fact,  research  indicates  that  81  percent  of  programmers  are  affiliated  with  a 
major  media  company.2 Thus,  small,  independent  and  religious  broadcasters  who 
are  not  affiliated  with  a  major  media  conglomerate  lack  the  leverage  to  negotiate 
with  cable  operators  to  receive  carriage  of  their  multicast  signals  in  digital  tele-
vision. Given the dilution of their voices in digital television, it is certain that some 
of these stations will either be forced to enter into some type of financial ownership 
or affiliate agreement with major media conglomerates or go dark. 

This would be tragic considering that the original intent of must-carry in the 1992 
Cable  Act  was  to  ensure  that  small  and  independent  broadcasters  would  continue 
to provide valuable diversity of programming to our nation. As we transition to dig-
ital  television  multicast  must-carry  will,  in  many  cases,  provide  the  only  assurance 
that small, independent, minority and religious broadcasters can maintain a propor-
tionate voice and continue serving niche markets with diverse local and community- 
focused  programming.  We  would  encourage  the  Committee  to  consider  these  issues 
as  the  DTV  bill  develops  this  session  and  ask  that  it  include  multicast  must-carry. 

APPENDIX A 

Examples  of  Current  RVB  Programming  and  Projected  Multicast 

Programming 

Mike  Reed  plans  on  utilizing  the  benefits  of  multicasting  to  further  expand  the 
fifty  hours  of  local  programming  his  station,  KMCT–TV  39,  airs  each  week  in  the 
West  Monroe,  Louisiana  area.  KMCT’s  current  programming  includes  Fully  Alive, 
a  live,  one-hour  nightly  talk  show  hosted  by  Mr.  Reed,  which  brings  diverse  people 
from  the  community  together  to  discuss  issues  of  the  day.  Guests  include  Members 
of  Congress,  Louisiana  Governors  and  local  Mayors  who  speak  on  topics  such  as 
health,  marriage  and  other  local  concerns.  During  the  show  KMCT  has  a  phone 
bank available for viewers to call in with questions, concerns or comments. Lessons 
from  God’s  Word,  hosted  by  Pastor  Eugene  Brown,  provides  a  spiritual  outlet  for 
those  who  cannot  leave  their  homes  because  of  injury  or  illness.  Let  God  Be  True

is  a  locally-produced  show  that  airs  the  preaching  of  area  churches  and  highlights 
the  teachings  of  Pastor  Larry  Burrel,  who  uses  graphs  and  visual  aids  to  educate 
viewers.  Sacred  Conversations  is  a  locally-produced  show  hosted  by  Mr.  Robert 
Charles  Payne,  a  West  Monroe  businessman,  and  previous  football  coach  for  West 
Monroe High School. Mr. Payne invites guests to speak about issues facing the com-
munity, including sports, health and disciplines of life. 

KMCT’s  programming  schedule  is  replete  with  locally-produced  shows  that  pro-
vide  valuable  services  to  Louisiana  communities.  KMCT  would  utilize  the  benefits 
of multicasting to lengthen and expand their current programming to include a 24- 
hour  church  channel  that  would  cover  local  services  and  church  sponsored  commu-
nity  activities.  Additionally,  KMCT  would  like  to  air  a  24-hour  children’s  channel 
and  24-hour  youth  channel  with  programs  focused  on  the  specific  interests  of  these 
age  groups.  In  an  effort  to  promote  student  sports  in  the  area,  KMCT  would  like 
to  expand  local  sports  coverage  by  devoting  a  channel  to  playback  shows  of  Neville 
High School and Ouachita High School. Each of these schools currently airs an hour 
per  week  of  game  highlights  and  interviews  with  coaches  and  players.  Ouachita 
High School also interviews students to discuss activities on campus including clubs, 
organizations  and  other  school  sponsored  programs.  KMCT  supports  the  develop-
ment  of  broadcasting  and  production  experience  for  students  at  the  University  of 
Louisiana  at  Monroe  and  Grambling  University,  which  has  a  predominantly  Afri-
can-American student body, by hiring them to work at the station and cover issues 
relating  to  their  university,  including  local  sports.  The  close  proximity  between 
KMCT  and  several  high  schools  and  universities  will  facilitate  increased  coverage 
of  local  sports  and  student  activities  through  multicasting,  and  facilitate  employ-
ment opportunities in broadcasting. 

Richard Hawkins is the General Manager of WLLA–TV 64, the only independent 
station in the Kalamazoo-Grand Rapids-Battle Creek market. WLLA offers a variety 
of  family-friendly  programming,  boasting  the  most  hours  of  local  programs  in  the 
market—17  hours  per  week.  Among  the  shows  WLLA  airs  is,  Transformed,  a  daily 
show hosted by Pastor Joel A. Brooks, Jr. that focuses on the African-American con-
stituency through programming that promotes racial harmony. Mr. Brooks leads an 
inter-denominational  and  multi-racial  congregation  of  2,000  people.  Getting  a  Grip 
is a unique show, hosted by one of the few female Pastors in Kalamazoo. Mrs. Beth 
Jones’  teachings  extend  to  the  community  at  large  and  reflect  a  female  perspective 
on the Christian doctrine. Pastor Duane VanderKlok hosts Walking by Faith, a daily 
teaching  and  bible  study  program  that  breaks  from  tradition  by  taking  viewers  on 
adventures  that  relate  to  bible  stories,  including  hunting  expeditions.  Pastor  Addis 
Moore  hosts  Mt.  Zion  Baptist  Church,  another  program  that  targets  the  African- 
American population and focuses on the needs of that community. 

In addition to valuable local church programming, WLLA works with the Western 
Michigan University (WMU) to air local coach’s shows, as well as men and women’s 
basketball  games.  In  association  with  the  Michigan  High  School  Athletics  Associa-
tion,  WLLA  is  committed  to  annually  airing  the  girl’s  high  school  volleyball  cham-
pionships  from  the  WMU  campus,  which  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  these 
young girls to gain public exposure. WLLA would use digital technology to multicast 
a  24-hour  channel  of  other  local  sports.  Other  digital  program  plans  include  a  24- 
hour  channel  of  family-friendly  and  wholesome  programming,  and  a  youth  channel 
with music and programs to benefit young people. 

Dr. James Thompson has developed a loyal and devoted following in South Caro-
lina,  due  to  his  remarkable  thirty-year  record  of  broadcast  public  service  to  Green-
ville,  and  its  surrounding  areas  with  his  station,  WGGS.  He  has  similar  stature  in 
Atlanta,  Georgia,  where  he  owns  a  second  television  station,  WATC.  Most  notably, 
Dr.  Thompson  and  his  wife  Joanne  host  The  Nightline,  a  live  two-hour  weeknight 
call-in  program  on  WGGS,  which  gives  people  from  the  community  an  opportunity 
to discuss a variety of local interests. Discussion topics have included conversations 
on current weather conditions and crop conditions; oral histories of South Carolina; 
highlights of area elderly and indigent care services as well as conversations on how 
issues of national significance affect South Carolinians. The Atlanta station, WATC, 
devotes  the  same  amount  of  time  and  resources  to  their  live,  local  nightly  show. 
WGGS’ daily variety program, The Peggy Denny Show, offers cooking and household 
tips  and  reviews  of  local  arts  and  politics.  Nancy’s  Heartbeat,  hosted  by  Nancy 
Corso, Greenville’s local chiropractor with a Master’s Degree in Trauma, is a weekly 
show  on  fitness  and  the  latest  news  in  medicine.  Jewish  Jewels  is  a  show  that  fo-
cuses on the Jewish religion and those who practice the faith in the area. 

Since  the  beginning  of  the  Iraqi  War,  Dr.  Thompson’s  stations  have  been  airing 
a  daily  scroll  of  the  names  of  the  local  soldiers  who  are  committed  to  active  duty 
in Iraq and ask viewers to send prayers and well wishes to the troops. WGGS keeps 
a  phone  bank  of  volunteer  ‘‘listeners’’  who  comfort  lonely  or  in  need  viewers  in  the

area  and  refers  more  troubled  individuals  to  local  crisis  help  groups.  WATC  also  is 
the  home  to  a  unique  program,  The  Gravedigger  Show,  hosted  by  Joe  Oreskovich, 
a  former  homeless  man  who  was  rescued  by  the  local  fire  department.  Joe  inter-
views  firemen,  policemen,  doctors,  politicians  and  others  to  inspire  and  provide  re-
sources,  guidance  and  hope  to  those  in  most  need  and  at-risk,  including  alcoholics, 
the unemployed, and the indigent. 

Our stations seek the ability to multicast to expand current programs and invest 
in developing new and original programming. On numerous occasions, North Green-
ville  College  has  asked  us  to  air  student  produced  shows  (a  request  that  is  usually 
unable  to  be  granted  because  of  established  programming  commitments).  With  the 
ability to multicast, we could provide the College its own channel, which would ben-
efit both the students and the community. Moreover, because of its geographical lo-
cation,  WATC  would  like  to  air  a  24-hour  gardening  and  agricultural  channel,  in 
addition  to  a  24-hour  sports  channel  that  will  focus  on  elementary,  secondary  and 
college  level  sports.  Finally,  we  would  continue  to  reach  out  to  the  community  by 
providing a vocational and employment channel that would be a resource for job an-
nouncements,  provide  information  on  various  trades  and  professions  and  promote 
employment in the area. 

Grace  Rendall  and  KSCE–TV  38  in  El  Paso,  Texas,  play  a  unique  role  in  their 
diverse  community  by  providing  bilingual  and  local  programming  to  the  ethnic  and 
religious  groups  in  the  region.  KSCE  airs  daily  programming  in  English  and  Span-
ish  and  provides  valuable  media  resources  for  El  Paso’s  large  Hispanic  community, 
which  has  limited  family-friendly  programming  choices.  Additionally,  KSCE  airs  a 
variety  of  programs  that  cater  to  the  sizable  El  Paso  Jewish  community,  like  the 
Monday  thru  Friday  showing  of  the  daily  news  by  the  Israel  Broadcast  Authority 
from  Jerusalem  and  Jewish  high  holy  season  shows.  KSCE  is  also  the  only  broad-
cast  station  in  the  area  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  estimated  3,000  Arab-speaking 
population.  They  broadcast  3  hours  a  week  in  Arabic,  with  teaching,  music  and  a 
woman’s  interest  roundtable.  With  the  ability  to  multicast,  KSCE  is  interested  in 
continuing  its  diversity  outreach  by  dedicating  two  digital  channels  to  full  time 
Spanish-language formats—one for general purpose and the second for a youth and 
adult educational needs. 

Steve Easom’s KSBI is the last locally owned station in the Oklahoma City, Okla-
homa  market,  and  it  provides  more  local  programming  than  all  full  power  stations 
in that DMA combined. With the ability to multicast, KSBI is committed to increas-
ing  the  youth,  elderly  and  Hispanic  focused  programming  that  they  currently  pro-
vide.  In  addition,  they  seek  to  expand  their  local  sports  coverage  and  unique  pro-
gramming. For instance, the Oklahoma City area boasts a strong hunting and fish-
ing community. KSBI produces and airs a program, On the Water and In the Woods 
with  Cody  and  Cody,  a  hunting  and  fishing  show  hosted  by  two  local  Oklahoma 
teens  that  focuses  on  hunting  safety  from  the  experiences  of  teenagers.  Further-
more,  when  a  local  major  network  affiliated  station  was  not  able  to  air  Oklahoma 
State  University  and  University  of  Oklahoma  coach’s  football  playbacks  because  of 
their  affiliate  obligations,  KSBI  negotiated  for  carriage  of  the  programs.  As  part  of 
the  agreement,  KSBI  stipulated  that  it  would  not  run  overtly  sexual  ads  that  may 
be offensive to a family audience during playback airings. Not only did the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma accept these conditions, but the head athletic director commended 
Mr. Easom for ‘‘raising the bar’’ in this area. 

Belarmino  ‘‘Blackie’’  Gonzalez’s  station,  KCHF  in  Santa  Fe,  New  Mexico,  is  dedi-
cated  to  offering  the  communities  of  New  Mexico  positive  informational  and  enter-
tainment  choices.  KCHF  plays  an  active  role  in  the  Santa  Fe  area  through  shows 
like  Issues  &  Answers,  a  weekly  program  hosted  by  New  Mexico’s  Press  Secretary 
that  invites  representatives  of  state  government  agencies  to  discuss  valuable  state 
programs  that  are  available  to  New  Mexicans.  Additionally,  KCHF  highlights  local 
charitable  causes  including  efforts  to  help  victims  of  the  Los  Almos  fires.  Comfort 
My People supports Israeli victims of terrorism through the United Jewish Commu-
nities’ programs. With added ability to multicast, KCHF hopes to take their current 
youth  programming  block  and  develop  a  channel  that  expands  its  reach  to  young 
people with shows like The Real, which discusses issues affecting teens and provides 
community  outreach  and  help  hotlines  for  at-risk  youth.  With  multicasting,  KCHF 
would expand their Spanish-language programming by developing a channel specifi-
cally focused on family-friendly programs for the Hispanic community in New Mex-
ico. 

Jamey  Schmitz  of  WLMB  Toledo,  Ohio,  has  committed  to  using  the  benefits  of 
multicasting  to  serve  local  viewers  by  providing  a  worship  channel  that  would  fea-
ture 24-hours of local area religious-related services. This channel would include ex-
panded versions of WLMB’s Pastor’s Point and Find a Local Church, programs that

denominations  have  been  represented  on  these  half  hour  weekly  programs.  Cur-
rently, the station has a backlog of over one hundred community leaders and venues 
awaiting  the  opportunity  to  feature  their  services.  In  many  cases,  these  shows  are 
the  only  television  exposure  that  churches,  synagogues  and  cultural-specific  reli-
gious  organizations  including  African-American  and  Hispanic  parishioners  are  af-
forded.  These  shows  have  been  extremely  successful  in  helping  new  Toledo  area 
residents and those new to faith find a place of worship for their families. 

WLMB would also reach out to the growing Hispanic community in Ohio, by start-
ing  a  24-hour  Spanish-language  channel  that  would  expand  upon  of  their  current 
weekly half hour Spanish-language program, which is the only foreign language pro-
gram in the entire market. WLMB regularly receives requests from Hispanic leaders 
to  include  updates  of  local  Latino-sponsored  events  on  the  show.  As  this  segment 
of  the  population  continues  to  grow,  the  ability  to  reach  these  viewers  through  a 
channel  devoted  to  their  specific  needs  would  utilize  free-over-the-air  broadcasting 
in a manner consistent with the objectives enumerated in Turner v. FCC. Addition-
ally, WLMB would like to start a 24-hour youth channel (a G rated MTV type chan-
nel)  that  would  provide  local  teens  the  opportunity  to  become  involved  in  the  pro-
duction, filming and editing of television programs. Toledo teens would have a local 
outlet  to  air  programming  that  is  timely  and  relevant  to  their  evolving  needs  and 
interests.  WLMB  envisions  expanding  their  current  music  video  show  that  features 
local artist’s interviews and family-friendly music videos. Finally, WLMB is pleased 
that in 2004, it will begin airing the Toledo Mud Hens baseball games. The beloved 
Mud  Hens  are  the  farm  team  for  the  Detroit  Tigers.  With  multicast,  WLMB  would 
air  24-hour  local  news  and  sports  channels,  as  a  collaborative  effort  with  organiza-
tions like the Mud Hens and area high schools and colleges. 

Ken Mikesell’s Orlando, Florida station, WTLG, would use its additional channels 
for Spanish and Asian language content; educational programs including PBS shows 
not  aired  in  the  market;  shows  serving  central  Florida’s  large  population  of  seniors 
and  children;  a  civic  and  local  government  channel  to  inform  the  transient  popu-
lation of available public services; and other locally-produced programs. The station 
would  expand  upon  its  regular  programs  featuring  local  nutritionists,  physicians, 
counselors and other community leaders who discuss health, psychological and spir-
itual  needs  of  the  community.  WTLG  produces  the  Easter  Sunrise  service  at  Sea 
World,  in  Florida,  for  uplink  to  stations  across  the  country,  including  the  Armed 
Services  Network,  which  it  carries  to  all  U.S.  military  bases.  WTLG  is  extremely 
active with local social and civic organizations and uses its airwaves to promote in-
terest  and  support  for  worthwhile  projects.  For  instance,  the  station  organizes  food 
drives for local ministries; arranged for receipt of over 5,000 turkeys to the Destiny 
Food Center in Orlando for Thanksgiving 2002; provided ‘‘Bags of Joy’’ to over 2000 
families through Harvestime International in Sanford; works with Operation Christ-
mas  Child,  run  by  Reverend  Billy  Graham’s  son  Franklin,  to  supply  toys,  toiletries 
and  clothing  to  the  needy;  and  participates  in  many  other  rewarding  ventures.  As 
a  melting  pot  for  many  ethnicities,  Orlando  is  the  perfect  example  of  a  community 
in need of additional local programming choices to serve its diverse constituents. 

Christian  Television  Network  (CTN),  headquartered  in  Clearwater,  Florida,  is 
dedicated  to  bringing  positive  Christian  programming  with  family-friendly,  whole-
some  messages  to  its  viewers  from  all  socio-economic  backgrounds.  Since  its  incep-
tion  twenty  years  ago,  CTN,  its  Tampa  Bay  station  WCLF,  and  its  founder  Bob 
D’Andrea  have  developed  unique  local  programs  including,  Bay  Focus,  an  original 
show that features and highlights ministries in central Florida that are involved in 
charitable activities to feed the homeless, create support centers in inner cities, and 
provide assistance to the needy. CTN also devotes numerous hours of programming 
to youth and Latinos with original programs like La Vida Ahora (Today’s Life), Vida 
Dura (A Hard Life), Kids Like You, and Kids on the Move. CTN also owns full-power 
stations  including  WHBR-Pensacola,  WHTN-Nashville,  WVLR-Knoxville,  WRXY-Ft. 
Myers, WFGC-Palm Beach, and WGNM-Tampa. With the ability to multicast, CTN 
will  further  develop  and  expand  programming  that  distinguishes  CTN  from  other 
broadcasters. 

While  not  a  24-hour  religious  station,  KIKU  in  Honolulu,  Hawaii,  is  unique  in 
that  it  broadcasts  in  eight  languages  every  week  providing  Hawaiian  Asian  lan-
guage  constituents  with  the  only  free-over-the-air  broadcast  programming  in  their 
native  languages.  Shows  like  Korean  Christian  Broadcasting,  Chinese  Community 
Broadcasting  in  Mandarin  and  Kikaida,  entertain  and  inform  those  who  have  no 
other sources of broadcast programming in their native languages. KIKU would use 
multicasting  for  specialized  local  Asian  language  channels.  For  example,  KIKU’s 
Community Calendar, a bi-weekly English service, could be translated into different 
Asian  languages.  The  diverse  Hawaiian  community  depends  on  KIKU’s  program-
ming and multicasting would provide a much-needed outlet for these services.

Finally,  Total  Living  Network  (TLN)  is  a  Chicago-based  organization  with  a  San 
Francisco affiliate, KTLN. TLN’s main objective is to produce and distribute original 
programming  for  the  TLN  schedule  and  the  broader  family-friendly  broadcast  mar-
ketplace. The unique programming TLN provides includes Aspiring Women, a show 
designed to address the concerns of modern women of all ages and backgrounds; and 
Health  Town,  an  invigorating,  healthy  lifestyles  show  for  the  entire  family.  TLN 
also produces Solid Rock VDO, an inspirational and entertaining music video show. 
All  Around  Rockford  is  a  show  that  highlights  ministries  in  the  community.  Mr. 
Jerry  Rose,  President  of  TLN,  hosts  Newsmakers  a  public  affairs  program  that  ad-
dresses difficult issues with supplemental media resources including a panel of jour-
nalists  who  discuss  current  events.  Newsmakers  was  nominated  for  an  Emmy  for 
Outstanding  Achievement  for  Information  Program-Public  Affairs  Series.  TLN  also 
works  with  several  community-based  nonprofits,  such  as  Kids  Around  the  World, 
Pregnancy  Care  Center,  Noah’s  Ark  Animal  Sanctuary,  Rockford  Rescue  Mission 
and  Motherhouse  to  provide  public  service  announcements  and  broadcast  exposure 
for  their  causes.  TLN  has  found  that  their  locally  tailored  programming  brings 
members  of  the  community  together.  Specifically,  TLN  focuses  its  outreach  efforts 
on  issues  to  help  viewers  cope  with  addiction,  physical/mental  abuse,  health,  grief, 
homelessness,  gangs,  divorce  and  sexual  assault.  Multicasting  would  give  TLN  the 
opportunity to expand its services and the positive programming. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS RETAILERS COALITION 

(CERC) 

Consumer  Electronics  Retailers  have  been  involved  in  the  transition  to  digital 
techniques  since  1985,  when  they  helped  introduce  the  digital  audio  Compact  Disc. 
Two decades later, it is high time to complete this transition. The single most effec-
tive  thing  that  the  Congress  can  do  is  to  set  a  clear,  definite,  unconditional  date 
for the cessation of analog broadcasts. 

CERC  members  include  specialist  retailers  Best  Buy,  Circuit  City,  RadioShack, 
and Tweeter, general retailers Target and Wal-Mart, and the three major retail as-
sociations—the North American Retail Dealers Association, the National Retail Fed-
eration, and the Retail Industry Leaders Association. 
A Hard Date for Cessation of Analog Television Broadcasts 

CERC  has  long  favored  a  ‘‘hard’’  and  unconditional  date  for  moving  exclusively 
to digital terrestrial broadcasts. In light of the complex budgetary and other factors 
involved,  we  have  not  presumed  to  tell  the  Congress  what  that  date  should  be. 
CERC  agrees  with  the  witnesses  and  Committee  members  who  participated  in  the 
July 12 hearings that it should be no later than January 1, 2009. 

The key factor. from CERC’s perspective, is that the date be reliable and uncondi-
tional,  so  that  if  we  tell  consumers  that  analog  terrestrial  broadcasting  via  an  an-
tenna  will  not  be  delivered  after  that  date,  it  will  be  a  truthful  statement.  We  do 
not  want  to  be  in  the  position  of  telling  customers  to  buy  or  not  to  buy  products 
based on inaccurate or unverifiable information. 

Once the transition date is clearly and reliably set, we and our vendors can start 
advising  consumers  that,  on  a  specific  future  date,  they  will  need  to  rely  on  alter-
natives to receiving analog signals from an antenna. 
Public Education 

Even  without  approaching  the  question  of  whether  a  consumer  will  be  impacted 
by the cessation of analog broadcasts, advances in technology keep offering new op-
tions  and  choices  to  consumers.  Most  of  these  have  little  or  nothing  to  do  with 
whether an over-the-air tuner is included. They are: 

pect ratio (4x3). 

• Transmission  and  Display  formats—High  Definition;  Enhanced  Definition; 
Standard Definition—digital (progressive); Standard Definition—interlaced (dig-
ital or analog). 1 
• Program and screen formats—Widescreen aspect ratio (16x9) or ‘‘traditional’’ as-
• Signal  acquisition—Antenna;  cable;  satellite;  and  now 
‘‘wireless,’’  and 
• Tuning, authorization, and payment—In the receiver; in a ‘‘set-top box’’ or PVR 
or  other  device;  or  through  a  ‘‘CableCARD’’-enabled  set  that  allows  purchase  of 
premium channels without a set-top box. 

‘‘broadband’’ variations. 

1 Transmission may be in one signal format but display in another.

• Types  of  displays—‘‘Traditional’’  and  ‘‘slim’’  cathode  ray  tube  (direct  view  and 
rear-projection);  LCD  panel;  plasma  panel;  LCD  rear-projection;  DLP  rear-pro-
jection; LCoS rear-projection; and DLP and other projectors. 

• Types of storage devices—VCRs; DVRs (removable media); PVRs (non-removable 

media) and variations (PCs, game players, hand-held devices). 

• Types  of  interfaces  between  devices—composite  analog;  component  analog  (SD); 
component analog (HD): DVI/HDMI; Firewire; USB; wireless variations; and as-
sociated  forms  of  copy  protection  which  triggers  only  for  certain  programming. 
These  features  and  facilities  represent  essential  progress.  But  the  availability  of 
such  a  wide  array  of  features  requires  retailers  and  manufacturers  to  provide  in-
creased customer guidance. Consumer electronics retailers serve our customers best 
by  trying  to  ‘‘qualify’’  the  customer—ascertain  his  or  her  needs  and  wants,  home 
room size and space, viewing and recording practices, potential for a home network, 
and  budget.  We  then  proceed  through  a  series  of  questions.  What  is  your  program-
ming  preference?  How  do  want  to  receive  it—off  air,  cable,  ‘‘telco,’’  satellite,  Inter-
net?  Do  you  want  the  option  of  moving  programming  throughout  the  house?  What 
devices  do  you  already  have?  How  many  of  those  would  you  like  to  keep?  How  im-
portant  is  sound;  do  you  want  all  your  products  linked  to  a  home  theater  receiver 
and speakers? Do you know about HDTV? Will you want to record HDTV? The sales 
associate then identifies the combination of display formats and features, signal ac-
quisition choices, and home network options that give the consumer what he or she 
needs.  Today,  unless  the  consumer  has  already  firmly  decided  upon  a  specific  pur-
chase—and  with  the  aid  of  Internet  research,  many  have—retailers  can  not  serve 
the  consumer  by  offering  products  on  an  isolated  basis.  Retailers  must  determine 
how  all  of  the  devices  will  fit  together  and  to  do  this  the  retailer  has  to  consider 
the whole picture. 
The CERC Guide to the DTV Transition 

CERC  members  have  continually  updated  their  consumer  information,  in  our 
product  displays,  advertising,  and  websites,  to  explain  to  consumers  the  sometimes 
dizzying  array  of  choices  in  this  transitional  environment.  We  have  also  worked 
with the FCC and the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) to develop, publicize 
and  distribute  a  ‘‘DTV  Tip  Sheet’’  with  core  information  about  digital  television 
products and services. 

In June, CERC released a 3-page consumer guide, What You Need To Know About 
The  ‘‘DTV  Transition’’—A  Dozen  Questions  &  Answers,  to  address  the  more  par-
ticular issues that arise from the planned end to analog broadcasts. 2 CERC’s press 
release that accompanied the Guide said: 

‘‘[W]e thought we should assemble for consumers what is now known about the 
prospects  for  analog  TV  broadcasts  to  be  shut  off.  and  what  this  may  mean  for 
them.  We’ve  tried  to  put  together  answers  to  the  most  basic  questions,  but  not 
to  mislead  consumers  by  omitting  future  options  or  considerations.  At  the  mo-
ment  there’s  no  way  to  do  this  in  less  than  three  pages  of  print.  We’d  prefer 
to have a shorter piece with fewer variables, but we don’t want to tell customers 
anything that’s inaccurate or incomplete.’’ 3 

CERC  also  invited  anyone  who  thinks  the  Guide  is  inaccurate,  incomplete,  or 
could  be  condensed,  to  propose  changes  to  be  incorporated  in  future  releases.  The 
key  to  cutting  down  the  number  of  variables,  however,  lies  in  definitive  action  by 
the Congress on the issues that give rise to the present uncertainties. 
Text and Placement of Label for TV Receivers Lacking Digital Tuners 

CERC’s specific suggestions as to any mandatory point of display labeling require-

ments—once a ‘‘hard date’’ has been set—are as follows: 

Text.  The  label  should  be  as  concise  as  possible,  while  not  misleading  the  con-
sumer  or  unnecessarily  driving  him  or  her  to  more  expensive  products.  Based  on 
our  experience  as  retailers,  we  are  concerned  that  too  long  a  label  will  not  be  read 
by  many  consumers.  We  want  any  advisory  label  to  be  readily  understood  when 
placed on or near a product on a retail shelf. So, if there is to be an advisory label, 
CERC has proposed one (subsequently endorsed by the CEA) that consumers would 
be likely to read and understand: 

2 The Guide is available on the front page of the CERC website, www.ceretailers.org; it is pro-
vided for the record as an Appendix to this submission. CERC indicated in its press release that 
it has no objection to other entities reproducing or distributing the Guide.

Notice:  This  TV  has  only  an  ‘analog’  broadcast  tuner  so  it  will  require  a  con-
verter  box  after  [date]  to  receive  over-the-air  broadcasts  with  an  antenna,  be-
cause  of  the  transition  to  digital  broadcasting  on  that  date.  (It  should  continue 
to  work  as  before  with  cable  and  satellite  TV  systems,  gaming  consoles,  VCRs, 
DVD players, and similar products.) 

Placement.  The  label  should  he  packed  with  or  affixed  to  the  television  receiver, 
so  a  retailer  would  have  the  choice  of  leaving  the  label  on  the  set  for  shelf  display, 
or  moving  it  to  the  vicinity  of  the  set  (so  as  not  to  cover  the  screen).  It  should  also 
be printed on the outside of boxes. 

• The  labels  should  be  packed  with  the  covered  TV  receivers,  to  reduce  uncer-
tainty  and  to  avoid  mistakes,  at  retail,  about  the  products  to  which  the  labels 
apply.  To  avoid  screen  damage  upon  removal  by  a  retailer  or  consumer,  the 
label should not necessarily have to be ‘‘on the screen’’ so long as it is attached 
to the product as shipped. 

• The retailer should be able either to leave the label on the product for shelf dis-
play, or move this label to the vicinity 4 of the point of product display. If a label 
is  affixed  to  a  screen,  it  should  not  necessarily  have  to  remain  there,  as  this 
could make it difficult for consumers to compare products. 

• The  label  text  should  also  be  printed  on  the  outside  of  the  retail  boxes  for  the 
products  to  which  it  applies,  because  some  retailers  display  TV  products  only 
in  the  closed  boxes.  Requiring  that  these  boxes  be  opened  could  lessen  a  con-
sumer’s confidence that he or she is receiving a factory-fresh product. 

• We  believe  that  Internet-based  sellers  (including  our  own  sites)  should  have 
equivalent ‘‘labeling’’ obligations at their own ‘‘point of display’’ for the product, 
or, if there is no ‘‘display,’’ at the point of sale. 

Subscription Carriage of Local Digital Broadcasts 

Much of the discussion of alternatives in the CERC Guide arises from uncertainty 
as  to  whether,  and  to  what  extent,  local  digital  broadcasts  will  be  carried  to  con-
sumer homes by subscription services such as cable and DBS. CERC has no position 
on  the  ultimate  outcome  of  the  heated,  ongoing  debate  between  the  broadcast  and 
cable  industries  on  this  score.  Some  elements  pertaining  to  such  carriage,  however, 
seem to be widely agreed upon in principle: 

• That many consumers—up to half of all cable subscribers—now watch broadcast 
channels, without aid of either a set-top box or an antenna, via the analog car-
riage  of  analog  broadcast  signals  over  cable  to  consumers’  homes,  where  these 
signals are directly tuned by the analog tuners of these consumers’ TVs. 
• That it is possible to maintain this carriage, even after analog broadcasts cease, 
via the tuning of the equivalent digital local broadcast at a cable ‘‘headend,’’ and 
the conversion or translation 5 of that broadcast into an analog transmission for 
carriage to these consumers’ homes, exactly as occurs today. 
• That it is more efficient, in a community of, e.g., 200,000 such viewers, for this 
conversion to occur once, at the cable headend, rather than 200,000 times—once 
in each consumer’s home. 
• That  in  order  for  these  ‘‘basic  cable’’  consumers  to  be  able  to  receive  such  car-
riage as they do today, without leasing a set-top box, they will need TV receiv-
ers  with  analog  tuners—a  point  that  is  often  overlooked  in  discussions  of  why 
there  remains  a  legitimate  consumer  demand  for  TV  receivers  with  (only)  ana-
log tuners. 

CERC believes that the highly nuanced debate about the circumstances and obli-
gations adhering to such carriage produced a somewhat confusing record in the July 
12 hearings. It believes that there is actually no serious controversy about the basic 
points laid out above, and that these points should be clearly understood as a basis 
for legislative determinations. 

4 CERC  believes  that  a  display  requirement  of  a  label  ‘‘in  the  vicinity’’  of  the  product  on  the 
shelf  is  more  realistic  than  the  ‘‘adjacent  to’’  language  of  the  House  Staff  Draft—depending  on 
how ‘‘adjacent’’ is interpreted, this might not be possible without blocking other important infor-
mation or features of the product or of another product on display. 

5 This  has  also  been  discussed  as  ‘‘down-conversion,’’  which  CERC  believes  to  be  an  unneces-
sarily  freighted  term.  Sustaining  a  previously  received  analog  broadcast  service  to  a  consumer, 
via conversion from digital, actually is likely to result in an improvement in the received signal. 
A  ‘‘down-conversion’’  occurs  only  if  the  broadcast  signal  is  not  also  passed  along  as  a  digital  si-
mulcast (as it generally is today) in its original resolution.

Obligations on Other Industries 

151 

Broadcasters should be obliged to make consumers aware of their digital channels 
and of the Transition. CERC. like CEA. has been disappointed with the lack of effort 
to date on the part of broadcasters to educate the consumer about the DTV Transi-
tion,  and  was  pleased  to  hear,  on  July  12,  a  commitment  by  NAB  to  do  so,  as  well 
as NAB’s endorsement of a January 1, 2009 ‘‘hard date.’’ These steps will be a wel-
come change from newspaper advertisements apparently aimed at further confusing 
the public about the transition by saying or implying that viewers would necessarily 
have  to  buy  a  new  TV  receiver  after  the  transition  date.  That  this  is  not  the  case 
was amply demonstrated at the July 12 hearings. 

CERC hopes that broadcasters will join in our effort to give consumers a full and 
candid  view  of  their  options,  as  they  appear  now,  and  as  they  will  appear  once  the 
Congress has set a real transition date and has determined what the broadcast car-
riage  rules  will  be.  In  the  meantime,  retailers  have  every  incentive  to  offer  con-
sumers  their  most  fully-featured  products,  rather  than  the  less  fully  featured  prod-
ucts  that  often  have  lower  profit  margins.  But  retailers  also  are  obliged  to  serve, 
first  and  foremost,  the  actual  needs  of  the  customer,  which  vary  greatly  according 
to circumstance and preference. 

The  ability  of  retailers  to  sell  products  with  integrated  broadcast  tuners  is  not 
helped  by  the  fact  that  most  broadcasters  are  not  airing  their  digital  channels  at 
full power, or conspicuously promoting their digital channels through on air or print 
advertising. It is in our interest to sell products with DTV tuners, but we need help 
from the broadcasters in interesting our customers in buying them. 
Provisions Re ‘‘Tuner Mandate’’ 

Thus far, under the FCC’s ‘‘Tuner Mandate’’ regime, our experience has been that 
a  government  mandate  trying  to  force  all  shoppers  to  buy  features  that  many  or 
most do not in fact, need can be counterproductive to the success of the Transition.6 
We  therefore  caution  against  trying,  in  this  legislation,  to  use  a  government  man-
date  rather  than  the  ‘‘hard  date’’  itself  as  the  main  instrument  for  influencing  sup-
ply  and  demand.  In  particular,  we  are  concerned  about  provisions  that  would  run 
ahead of feasible design, engineering, and production cycles: 

all; 

• They  would  likely  drive  the  market  toward  products  with  no  off-air  tuners  at 
• They  would  deny  useful  products  to  those  consumers  least  able  to  afford  tele-
• They would be inconsistent with, and detract from, the provisions (as discussed 
above) that recognize cable headend conversion to analog transmission as meet-
ing Transition requirements. 

vision receivers; and 

The  FCC’s  Tuner  Mandate  has  proved  a  fragile  instrument  for  driving  the  tele-
vision  receiver  market  toward  the  inclusion  of  DTV  tuners.  Even  the  requirement 
that  100  percent  of  a  size  category  of  television  receivers  must  include  DTV  tuners 
can  have  only  limited  impact  on  consumer  choices,  because  not  all  video  display 
products  are  ‘‘television  receivers.’’ 7 In  an  era  in  which  more  than  85  percent  of 
households  are  connected  to  cable  or  satellite,  the  hard  fact  is  that  most  consumer 
displays  for  video  programming  may  not  need  to  be  ‘‘television  receivers’’—that  is, 
the  displays  meet  consumer  needs  without  relying  on  any  TV  tuner,  analog  or  dig-
ital, because they receive their programming from a cable, satellite, or other set-top 
box over non-broadcast interfaces. 

CERC  would  oppose,  in  particular,  any  provision  that  would  move  the  existing 
FCC  Mandate  date  for  televisions  with  screen  sizes  of  13  through  24  inches,  and 
other products containing television tuners (such as VCRs, ‘‘PVRs,’’ and DVD record-
ers),  up  to  a  date  any  earlier  than  March  1,  2007,  because  it  would  likely  destroy, 

6 We have found the mandate to equip 50 percent of all displays of 36 inches and above with 
digital tuners to be particularly counterproductive. By rationing the ultimate supply of products 
without such tuners, it has encouraged retailers to secure their supplies by ordering these prod-
ucts up-front, and to await price cuts on the products that contain tuners, because manufactur-
ers will be required to sell these whether or not there is a demand for them. Such demand will 
be limited because, while many consumers may need or want terrestrial tuners in their displays, 
most  of  our  customers  are  cable  and  satellite  subscribers  who  might  not  need  or  want  to  pay 
for a broadcast tuner. 

7 A  ‘‘Television  Receiver’’  is  a  product  having  an  off-air  broadcast  tuner  and  antenna  termi-
nals. The Tuner Mandate requires only that products with analog off-air tuners must have dig-
ital off-air tuners as well. A consumer display product, such as a PC monitor, may have a vari-
ety of interfaces to accept both analog and digital television signals from cable, satellite, or other 
set-top boxes, yet lack any off-air tuner, so it is not a ‘‘Television Receiver.’’

rather than enhance, these product categories. Such a provision would damage both 
the transition and the least-affluent portion of the viewing public.

• First,  these  sets  are  very  severely  affected  by  price  considerations.  A  consumer 
who  buys  a  $69  13-inch  color  television  is  generally  moved  by  necessity,  more 
than  by  a  search  for  the  most  compelling  experience.  CERC’s  general  retail 
members  have  noted  that  many  of  these  sets  are  bought  on  layaway,  by  cus-
tomers  who  do  not  have  bank  accounts.  Even  semiconductor  maker  Zoran, 
which has no retail experience and has made predictions based on assumptions 
that are at best aggressive and at worst unrealistic, admits that adding a DTV 
tuner  in  the  timeframe  now  under  discussion  would  increase  the  cost  of  such 
a  product  by  ‘‘around  $80–$100  depending  on  the  brand  and  model.’’ 8 Having 
the price of a $69 color TV go to $169 by July 1, 2006, would eviscerate the low- 
end  of  this  product  category,  punishing  the  consumers  who  are  least  able  to  af-
ford television receivers. 

• If small TVs become too expensive for their market, the only alternative would 
be  product  lines  of  ‘‘receivers’’  with  no  off-air  tuners  at  all.  We  have  seen  this 
class  of  ‘‘monitor’’  product  emerge  already  in  the  large-screen  category,  even 
though the DTV tuner is a much smaller component of the cost of a large-screen 
television. A 22 inch LCD display with no tuner, for example, could be an alter-
native  for  a  consumer  who  relies  on  a  cable  or  satellite  set-top  box  anyway.9 
• Driving  analog  tuners  out  of  inexpensive  televisions  seems  especially  counter-
productive in light of the expectation, discussed above, that cable operators will 
convert  DTV  broadcasts  to  analog  broadcast  transmissions  at  their  headends, 
so that consumers with analog tuner TVs will be served. If TV sets do not have 
analog  tuners,  there  is  no  point  in  converting  signals  to  analog  at  cable 
headends.  ‘‘Basic  cable’’  customers  who  rely  on  analog  tuners  to  tune  these 
channels  will  be  sorely  surprised  when  their  sets  have  no  place  to  plug  in  the 
cable. 

• The  Congress,  concerned  as  it  is  about  consumers  who  must  bear  the  costs  of 
the transition, needs to confront the fact that a low-end TV with only an analog 
tuner may be the only affordable option for some consumers. To drive these sets 
out of the market prematurely, by advancing Tuner Mandate dates that double 
the  prices  of  such  sets,  is  to  place  the  burden  of  the  Transition  on  those  who 
are least able to afford it. 

CERC has not asked that the existing Tuner Mandate dates for 13 inch receivers 
be pushed back. But we think it would be contrary to the legislation’s purposes, and 
very  unfair  to  low-income  consumers,  to  try  to  move  them  up.  The  same  is  even 
more  true  for  receivers  with  screen  sizes  below  13  inches.  CERC  and  CEA  will  be 
presenting  evidence  to  the  FCC  that,  for  the  smallest  categories  of  TVs,  and  for 
VCRs and other small chassis devices that lack TV screens, the design, engineering, 
and production resources of manufacturers are simply not available to produce such 
products for sale by a date any earlier than March 1, 2007; and to the extent some 
might  be  available,  the  cost  is  likely  to  be  prohibitive  for  the  (largely  low-income) 
consumers who define the market for such products.10 
Consumer Subsidies 

CERC has not presumed to tell the Congress whether there should be such a sub-
sidy  or  who  should  be  eligible  to  receive  it.  Nevertheless,  we  all  stand  ready  and 
willing  to  assist  with  our  nationwide  distribution  abilities.  But  we  do  have  a  few 
concerns  over  how  a  subsidy  might  be  applied  or  administered.  Our  core  concerns 
are these: 

• Congress  should  not  attempt  to  fix  the  prices  of  real-world  products  based  on 
the funds available for a subsidy. There are too many variables, including large 

8 See Zoran May 16, 2005, ex parte letter in FCC Docket No. 05–24. 
9 We had hoped that prospective inclusion of the ‘‘CableCARD’’ feature, which can be inexpen-
sively added to products with DTV tuners, would heighten their appeal to consumers, but unfor-
tunately  these  products  are  not  being  promoted  by  the  cable  industry,  and  issues  have  been 
raised  as  to  their  technical  support.  Of  the  approximately  one  million  such  TV  receivers  sold 
to date, only about 40,000 are being served by CableCARDs. 

10 TV manufacturers have been fully engaged in phasing DTV tuner capacity into their larger 
products  first,  in  accordance  with  the  existing  FCC  mandate.  Their  necessary  engineering,  de-
sign,  and  production  resources  are  still  engaged  in  this  effort  and  cannot  instantly  be  turned 
to the separate engineering and production requirements posed by different and smaller chassis 
products.

differences in the projections of costs 2 years hence, and of the number of house-
holds and sets for which there is a demand.11 
• We  believe  that  any  subsidy  should  flow  directly  from  the  government  to  eligi-
ble consumers. Retailers’ role in the process should be limited to doing what we 
do  best:  providing  the  best  product  that  fits  the  consumer’s  needs  and  desires. 
However,  as  stated  above  we  stand  ready  and  willing  to  assist  in  any  reason-
able  subsidy  program.  There  are  retailers  in  every  neighborhood  in  America 
that  could  assist  in  product  distribution.  But  the  program  must  be  sufficiently 
simple, must minimize financial risk to the retailer, and provide reasonable in-
centive to participate. 
• CERC would have specific concerns over a subsidy program that would require 
retailers  to  advance  the  subsidy  amount  to  consumers,  and  to  recover  it  from 
the government: 
—Any retailer reimbursement program should be a direct obligation of the U.S. 
Government  for  each  sale  of  a  specified  product.  Reimbursement  within  a 
standard commercial time-frame should be assured. 

—A number of specific questions with respect to eligibility, reimbursement, and 

avoiding and accounting for fraud, would need to be addressed.12 

Several  CERC  members  have  been  interviewed  by,  and  voiced  their  views  and 
concerns to, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Budg-
et  Office.  The  members  of  CERC  know  that  the  issue  of  the  subsidy  is  a  difficult 
one. While we take no position on whether there should or should not be a subsidy, 
we  can  provide  real-world  input  as  to  how  programs  might  operate  and  assist  the 
Committee in avoiding purported solutions based on unrealistic assumptions. 

CERC  and  its  members  stand  ready  to  assist  the  Committee  in  addressing  any 
or  all  of  the  issues  discussed  in  this  submission.  We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to 
provide this submission, and its Appendix, for the record. 

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE ‘‘DTV TRANSITION’’— 

A DOZEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

1. What is ‘‘DTV?’’ 

DTV stands for ‘‘digital television,’’ or, in this case, the broadcasting of digital tel-
evision  by  local  TV  broadcasters.  The  signals  are  sent  from  local  transmitters,  over- 
the-air, to homes, by modern digital techniques rather than the older ‘‘analog’’ meth-
ods that are not as efficient. 
2. What is ‘‘HDTV?’’ 

HDTV  (short  for  High  Definition  Television)  is  the  highest  quality  form  of  DTV. 
Not all DTV broadcasts are in HDTV and not all DTV receivers can display HDTV. 
Broadcasts  in  HDTV  are  available  only  on  DTV  broadcast  channels—they  are  not 
available over analog broadcast channels. (HDTV is also available from digital cable, 
satellite, and other services.) 
3. What is the ‘‘DTV Transition?’’ 

In  the  next  few  years,  it  is  likely  that  over-the-air  broadcasting  of  free  TV  (from 
broadcast transmitters to homes) will move exclusively to ‘‘digital’’ channels, and the 
more  familiar  ‘‘analog’’  channels  will  be  switched  off.  Already,  almost  all  broad-
casters are using two sets of channels—the newer ‘‘digital’’ channels, and the ‘‘ana-

11 There are potential regulatory hurdles. as well. For example, California recently established 
an  energy  standard  of  8  watts  in  ‘‘on’’  mode,  1  watt  in  ‘‘standby’’  mode  for  converter  boxes— 
an  unrealistic  standard,  unlikely  to  be  met  by  the  ‘‘converter’’  displayed  during  the  hearing.  If 
such  state  provisions  are  not  pre-empted  in  the  subsidy  law  they  could  impede  acquisition  of 
products or increase costs. 

12 These  questions  include:  How  to  prevent  false  claims?  Would  all  retailers,  no  matter  how 
large or small, be audited regularly by the government? How to apply the program to Internet- 
based  merchants;  how  to  find  them  to  audit  the  bona  fides  of  their  claims  for  reimbursement? 
CERC  members  are  concerned  that  the  opportunities  for  abuse  presented  by  such  a  reimburse-
ment  program—as  to  which  internal  accounting  data  would  be  the  only  evidence  of  actual 
sales—would lead either to loss of credibility for all claims, or to government and retail auditing 
costs that are dramatically out of scale to the amounts being claimed. Would eligibility require-
ments for retailers be imposed? Would attempts be made to artificially set or define retail prices 
for  particular  products?  Would  adequate  provision  be  made  for  the  expenses  imposed  on  retail-
ers? CERC would oppose both retailer eligibility requirements and attempts to set or pre-define 
the  retail  price  of  products.  Retailers  should  be  reimbursed  for  their  transaction  and  shipping 
costs, including the direct and indirect costs of audits.

log’’  channels  that  have  been  in  use  since  the  1940s.  It  is  these  ‘‘analog’’  channels, 
by  which  you  are  accustomed  to  identifying  your  local  broadcasters,  that  are  being 
replaced by different, digital channels that in most cities are already on the air. 
4. Will there be any charge to receive these digital channels? 

No,  broadcasts  that  are  now  free  (or  advertiser-supported)  to  consumers  who  re-
ceive  them  via  antennas  are  expected  to  remain  free.  (It  is  possible  that  additional 
‘‘pay’’ services may be launched in the future, but these are not expected to replace 
the free services offered today.) 
5. Why will over-the-air broadcasting stop on the ‘‘analog’’ channels? 

For  more  than  half  a  century,  TV  broadcasts  have  used  the  technology  that  was 
invented  in  the  1920s  and  1930s,  and  refined  (by  adding  color)  in  the  1950s.  In 
1997, when broadcasters became interested in HDTV, and in order to find additional 
space  for  emergency  communications  and  advanced  services,  the  Congress  decided 
that it was time for TV broadcasting to move to more modern and efficient ‘‘digital’’ 
techniques,  which  support  HDTV  or,  alternatively,  allow  broadcasters  to  offer  more 
channels  to  viewers.  So,  Congress  instructed  the  Federal  Communications  Commis-
sion (‘‘FCC’’) to assign to broadcasters new ‘‘DTV’’ channels and, after a ‘‘DTV Tran-
sition’’ period, to have the broadcasters return their old analog channels. 

• Once  DTV  broadcasts  are  up  and  running  (as  they  are  now  in  many  commu-
nities)—and  consumers  are  able  to  receive  them  (which  many  are,  particularly 
over digital cable and satellite services)—the ‘‘analog’’ channels with which most 
consumers presently identify local TV stations, are supposed to disappear. Their 
frequencies will be re-assigned for other uses through an ‘‘auction.’’ Holding an 
auction  for  these  frequencies  will  free  up  space  for  new  ‘‘broadband’’  and  other 
communication  services,  and  will  help  emergency  responders  to  coordinate  their 
communications.  (Finding  new  frequencies  for  emergency  communications  be-
came a high priority after September 11, 2001.) 

6. When will over-the-air broadcasting on the analog channels stop? 

Congress’s original target date was the end of 2006, but you have not heard much 
about  it  because  this  date  was  subject  to  a  number  of  conditions—primarily,  the 
readiness,  as  judged  by  the  FCC,  of  most  consumers  to  receive  the  newer  digital 
broadcasts—and  these  conditions  are  unlikely  to  be  met  by  the  end  of  2006.  How-
ever,  pressed  by  the  need  to  ‘‘recover’’  this  valuable  spectrum  for  other  uses,  and 
with  the  facilities  for  digital  broadcasting  now  well  established,  Congress  is  consid-
ering new legislation that would set a clear, definite and unconditional date for ana-
log broadcasts to stop—the transition would have to be complete by January 1, 2009. 
7.  I  now  subscribe  to  cable  or  satellite.  Do  I  need  to  be  concerned  about 

an end to free, over-the-air analog broadcasts? 

You  will  probably  not  notice  much  change  for  those  TVs  hooked  up  to  your  cable 
or satellite service, but you might be missing out on some opportunities. Cable oper-
ators  pick  up  most  local  broadcasts  at  a  central  location  and  send  them  to  homes 
over cable; satellite services increasingly are able to do this as well. It is likely that 
they  will  continue  to  provide  whatever  free  local  broadcast  programming  they  cur-
rently provide to you, even after there is this change in broadcasters’ means of trans-
mission. However: 

• If you have TVs in your house that are not hooked up to your cable or satellite 
service,  and  rely  on  an  antenna  to  receive  conventional  broadcasts,  you  will 
need to make alternative arrangements to keep watching these TVs. 
• In the future, cable operators might also move to ‘‘all digital’’ means of delivery, 
which  could  mean  you  would  need  to  lease  a  ‘‘set-top  box’’  or  own  a  TV  with  a 
digital cable tuner (such as one with a ‘‘CableCARD’’ slot) to continue to receive 
the channels you now view on a conventional TV. 
• If  a  local  broadcaster  launches  several  new  digital  channels,  a  cable,  satellite, 
or other programming service operator might not agree, or be required, to carry 
all of their local digital or HDTV broadcasts. You might, therefore, need a DTV 
or HDTV tuner and an antenna in order to receive those channels. 

8. Does my TV have a DTV tuner? What about my VCR, DVD recorder, PVR, 

DVR, etc.? 

The  only  televisions  that  have  DTV  tuners  are  those  that  have  been  sold—since 
about 1998—as having an ‘‘integrated’’ HDTV broadcast tuner (also called an ‘‘ATSC 
Tuner’’).  Most  of  these  products  are  also  capable  of  displaying  HDTV,  so  they  are 
sometimes advertised or sold as ‘‘HD Built-in.’’ (A set sold as ‘‘HD-ready’’ is capable

155 

of  displaying  HDTV  but  does  not  have  a  built-in  HDTV  tuner.)  Recently  the  FCC 
has  started  requiring—on  a  phased-in  basis—that  larger  TVs  with  ‘‘analog’’  tuners 
also  be  marketed  with  built-in  or  separate  DTV  tuners,  so  you  should  be  seeing 
more  and  more  ‘‘integrated’’  or  ‘‘built-in’’  products  in  stores.  (Some  of  these  may  be 
‘‘DTV’’ or ‘‘EDTV’’ sets that cannot display full HDTV.) 

• Separate HDTV broadcast tuner products have been available for several years. 
(You  are  likely  to  know  if  you  have  one.)  Once  Congress  passes  its  ‘‘transition’’ 
legislation,  you  can  expect  to  see  ‘‘DTV  Broadcast  Converter’’  products  that, 
when  hooked  up  to  an  antenna,  convert  the  new  digital  broadcast  signal  to  an 
old analog signal that your older TV can tune and display. 
• Most  VCRs,  DVD  recorders,  personal  video  recorders  (PVRs)  and  digital  video 
recorders  (DVRs)  do  not  presently  have  HDTV  or  DTV  broadcast  tuners,  even 
though they may record by digital means. (However, if one of these products has 
a  slot  for  a  ‘‘CableCARD,’’  it  probably  also  has  an  HDTV  or  DTV  broadcast 
tuner.) ‘‘DVRs’’ provided by cable operators do not have digital broadcast tuners 
(cable operators use a different means to transmit digital signals), but some pro-
vided  by  satellite  operators  do.  The  considerations  for  supporting  these  non-TV 
products are similar to those for your present TVs. 

9.  What  does  the  future  shutoff  of  the  analog  channels  mean  to  me  if  I  am 

shopping for a new TV? 

If  you  plan  to  purchase  a  new  TV  that  will  rely  on  a  rooftop  or  indoor  antenna, 
you may want to make sure that it has an integrated (built-in) HDTV or DTV tuner. 
In  fact,  as  noted  above,  FCC  rules  now  require  of  TV  manufacturers  that  any  TV 
with  a  screen  size  of  36  inches  or  greater  that  has  an  analog  broadcast  tuner  must 
also have a DTV broadcast tuner built-in or marketed to retailers with the set. This 
requirement  is  being  phased-in  to  all  sets  and  other  products  that  have  analog  TV 
tuners. (‘‘Monitors,’’ however, such as those used with computers, need not have any 
tuner.)  One  bonus:  Many  of  these  ‘‘built-in’’  sets  also  have  slots  for  CableCARDS 
which, when provided by your cable operator, allow you to tune premium cable chan-
nels (including HDTV channels) without needing a set-top box. This gives you an ad-
ditional choice if, in the future, you might plan to subscribe to a cable service. 

• If your new set is going to be hooked up to a cable, satellite, or telephone com-
pany  video  programming  service  instead  of  to  an  antenna,  you  may  not  need 
a DTV broadcast tuner. You can expect to receive all of the broadcast channels 
that  you  are  accustomed  to  watching  if  they  are  carried  by  this  operator.  How-
ever: 
—If  these  broadcast  channels  are  not  carried,  or  are  not  carried  in  full  HDTV 
resolution, you will need an antenna to get the remaining local channels, and 
your set would need an HDTV or DTV tuner built-in or added on (depending 
on  whether  the  channels  you  want  include  HDTV  broadcasts  and  whether 
your  set  can  display  HDTV).  For  local  information,  see  www.antennaweb.org. 
—You  may  in  the  future  need  to  lease  a  set-top-box  from  your  cable,  satellite, 
or  telephone  company,  particularly  if  your  new  set  does  not  accept  a 
CableCARD. 

10.  What  does  the  future  shut-off  of  the  analog  channels  mean  to  me  in 
watching the TVs now in my home that are not connected to a cable or 
satellite service? 

If your TV is not currently hooked-up to an antenna (for example, it is being used 
to  play  video  games,  or  to  watch  DVDs  or  camcorder  movies,  etc.),  nothing  will 
change, because only free over-the-air broadcasts will be affected by this DTV broad-
cast  transition.  If  your  existing  TV  currently  relies  on  an  antenna  to  receive  free 
broadcast  programming  (and  it  does  not  have  an  ‘‘integrated  DTV  tuner’’),  you  will 
have several options: 

• You  could  subscribe  to  a  cable,  satellite,  or  other  program  delivery  service  that 
carries  the  broadcast  programming  in  which  you  are  interested.  If  you  are  al-
ready  a  cable,  satellite,  or  other  programming  service  subscriber,  you  can  ex-
tend your hook-up to reach this TV. To continue to rely on an antenna, you will 
need an external ‘‘DTV Broadcast Converter’’ product. 
• If  your  set  is  ‘‘HD-ready’’  you  will  want  a  tuner  that  can  display  HDTV  broad-
casts  in  full  HDTV  resolution  (rather  than  ‘‘down-converting’’  them  to  a  Lesser 
format). 
• If your set is a ‘‘standard’’ television, you will want to obtain a ‘‘DTV Broadcast 
Converter’’  product  that  converts  a  ‘‘DTV’’  or  ‘‘HDTV’’  broadcast  to  a  standard

‘‘analog’’  output  that  your  TV  can  receive—either  as  ‘‘channel  3  or  4’’  or  one  of 
the  other  standard  inputs  that  your  TV  already  has.  The  Congress  is  consid-
ering  whether  or  not  to  assist  some  or  all  consumers  in  obtaining  these  con-
verters,  but  no  decision  has  yet  been  made  on  this  issue.  Relatively  inexpensive 
DTV Broadcast Converter products are likely to show up in stores once the leg-
islation has passed, and the ‘‘transition date’’ is known for sure. 

11. What else do I need to know about HDTV? 

High  Definition  Television,  or  ‘‘HDTV,’’  is  the  more  general  name  for  showing 
video in a new and better format—a wider screen with about 5 times the picture in-
formation. All types of video displays—conventional picture tubes, the various sorts 
of  projection  TVs,  and  the  new  ‘‘flat  panels’’—can  show  HDTV  if  they  are  designed 
to  handle  all  of  this  video  information  in  the  new  format.  You  can  expect  a  product 
to tune or display HDTV only if it was sold or advertised as such. 

• If  your  existing  set  is  not  ‘‘HD-ready’’  or  ‘‘HD  built-in’’  (‘‘integrated’’)  it  will  not 
display an HDTV signal in full quality, even if an ‘‘HDTV broadcast converter’’ 
is attached to it. 
• If  your  existing  set  is  ‘‘HD-ready’’  it  should  display  an  HDTV  quality  picture 
when  an  HDTV  broadcast  converter  is  attached  (but  will  display  only  a  stand-
ard quality picture from a ‘‘DTV Broadcast Converter’’ that is not advertised as 
HDTV). 
• For  your  existing  TV  that  cannot  handle  HDTV  a  ‘‘DTV  Broadcast  Converter’’ 
should  tune  the  HDTV  broadcast  channels,  but  provide  them  to  your  set  in  the 
standard  quality  format  that  your  set  can  display.  (Some,  but  not  all,  of  these 
might also provide HDTV-quality signals to ‘‘HD-ready’’ sets.) 

12. What is ‘‘EDTV?’’ 

Enhanced Definition Television, or ‘‘EDTV,’’ refers to the capability of displays to 
show  pictures  at  about  the  same  quality  level  as  DVDs—better  than  pictures  from 
standard  analog  broadcasts,  but  not  of  the  same  quality  as  an  HDTV  display.  For 
such  a  set,  you  might  get  better  performance  from  a  broadcast  converter  product 
that  has  enhanced  capabilities  as  well.  For  further  information  on  display  formats, 
see  the  Consumer  Electronics  Association’s  HDTV  Consumer  Guide  at  http:// 
farsight.decisionmark.com/docs/cea.pdf.
