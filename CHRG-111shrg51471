NOMINATIONS  TO  THE 

EXECUTIVE  OFFICE  OF  THE  PRESIDENT 
AND  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  COMMERCE 

THURSDAY,  FEBRUARY  12,  2009 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:20  a.m.,  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  John  D.  Rockefeller 
IV, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

The CHAIRMAN. Let us have our witnesses come. 
Now, we are doing something a little different today, and that is 
that we are going to do two witnesses at once. This is not to dimin-
ish,  obviously,  either  one  of  them,  because  that  is  an  impossibility 
just by their nature, but it is simply so that we can cross-question 
if  we  wish  and  because  it  saves  time  and  because  we  want  to  get 
their nominations moving as fast as possible. 

Members should also be aware that on February 26 we will have 
hopefully,  if  the  paperwork  is  done—and  it  should  be—our  Sec-
retary  of  Commerce  before  us  on  February  26.  So  mark  that  down 
and please be sure to be here for that. 

Dr.  Holdren,  you  are  in  the  White  House,  and  so  why  don’t  you 

make your opening statement? 

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN P. HOLDREN, DIRECTOR- 

DESIGNATE, OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY, 

EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator 
Hutchison,  Members  of  the  Committee.  It  is  an  honor  and  a  privi-
lege to appear before you as President Obama’s nominee for Direc-
tor  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy.  That  office  has 
two  broad  areas  of  responsibility,  and  if  confirmed  by  the  Senate, 
I will give my enthusiastic attention to both of those. 

One  of  them  is  policy  for  science  and  technology,  meaning  poli-
cies  for  strengthening  the  research  and  development  enterprise  in 
the public and private sectors, for science and technology education 
and  training,  and  for  fostering  the  conditions  under  which  ad-
vances  in  science  and  technology  can  be  translated  into  economic, 
environmental, and security benefits for society at large. 

The other side of the office’s responsibilities are science and tech-
nology  for  policy,  which  means  ensuring  that  insights  from  science

and  engineering  are  available  to  our  elected  leaders  as  they  shape 
economic policy, defense policy, health policy, environmental policy, 
and so on. 

OSTP  has  the  challenge  of  covering  both  of  those  broad  and  de-
manding  domains  in  the  White  House,  in  interaction  with  other 
Executive  Branch  agencies,  and  in  interaction  with  the  Congress, 
with a modest staff and budget. And that means we need to recruit 
very  high  caliber  people  both  for  the  professional  staff  and  for  the 
volunteer but senior advisors on the President’s Council of Advisors 
on Science and Technology, and it means that we have to use that 
in-house talent to reach out to and draw on the advice of the wider 
science and engineering communities. 

I  would  like  now,  if  I  may,  to  offer  a  few  brief  thoughts  about 
the  major  challenges  facing  our  country  at  the  intersection  of 
science  and  technology  with  the  economy,  the  environment,  and 
with national security, and about how the work of OSTP relates to 
those challenges. 

American  investments  in  science  and  engineering  have  driven 
much  of  the  economic  growth  that  our  country  has  enjoyed  for  the 
past  half  century,  by  most  accounts  50  to  85  percent  of  it.  Two- 
thirds  of  our  productivity  gains  in  the  recent  decades  are  directly 
attributable to scientific and technological advances, and in today’s 
time  of  economic  crisis,  we  have  to  resist  the  temptation  to  reduce 
our investments in these foundations of our prosperity. 

In  this  connection,  I  want  to  give  special  mention  to  the  impor-
tance  of  R&D  in  our  space  program.  Maintaining  and  expanding 
our capabilities in space is sometimes regarded as a luxury that we 
should do less of in the face of more pressing earthbound concerns. 
I  think  that  would  be  false  economy.  Space  is  crucial  to  our  na-
tional  defense.  It  is  crucial  to  civil  as  well  as  military  communica-
tions  and  geopositioning.  It  is  crucial  to  weather  forecasting  and 
storm monitoring, crucial to observation and scientific study of the 
condition of our home planet’s land, vegetation, oceans, and atmos-
phere,  and  it  is  crucial  to  scientific  study  and  exploration  looking 
outward. As with the rest of our fundamental and applied research 
enterprise, investments in space are a bargain. 

In  concert  with  helping  to  nurture  the  R&D  enterprise  in  gen-
eral, OSTP has an important function in promoting the translation 
of  the  results  of  R&D  into  new  products  and  services  that  benefit 
Americans  through  widespread  application.  This  country  has  long 
demonstrated a high capacity for turning novel ideas into new busi-
nesses  and  improved  services.  Fostering  this  capacity  for  trans-
lating science and technology into widespread benefit is going to be 
crucial  in  rebuilding  our  economy,  as  well  as  in  addressing  our 
most  pressing  challenges  in  energy,  environment,  health,  and  na-
tional security. 

Development  of  new  technologies  and  providing  incentives  for 
their widespread adoption is going to be particularly crucial at the 
demanding  intersection  of  energy,  national  security,  and  climate 
change.  Providing  the  affordable  and  reliable  energy  that  our  eco-
nomic  well-being  requires,  while  also  addressing  the  dangers  of 
global  climate  change  and  over-dependence  on  imported  oil,  are 
challenges  demanding  the  utmost  in  collaboration  among  the  rel-

ative Executive Branch agencies, the Congress, and the private sec-
tor. 

Information technology has been a key driver of our productivity 
growth  in  recent  decades,  and  it  has  fundamentally  changed  the 
way  people  worldwide  communicate  and  work.  But  we  have  just 
seen the beginning of what can be achieved. Information technology 
has  vast  potential  to  improve  health  care,  to  increase  energy  effi-
ciency, to monitor climate and other environmental conditions, and 
to  manage  the  immense  amounts  of  data  from  scientific  efforts 
from the Human Genome Project to the Large Hadron Collider. 

Better  use  of  existing  and  new  information  technologies  is  also 
going  to  be  a  key  ingredient  to  improving  K–12,  college,  and  uni-
versity education in this country and not just to produce the future 
cohorts  of  scientists,  engineers,  and  mathematicians  that  we  are 
going to need. It is also going to be key in upgrading the country’s 
entire workforce and providing Americans with the tools they need 
to  participate  successfully  in  our  democracy  in  an  era  where 
science,  technology,  and  information  are  becoming  ever  more  im-
portant. 

I want to mention finally the crucial roles that science and tech-
nology play in our country’s capacity to deal with threats to our se-
curity both at home and abroad. Those include the need to address 
complex  new  challenges  (asymmetric  conflicts,  urban  operations, 
cyber  threats,  potential  terrorist  access  to  weapons  of  mass  de-
struction),  as  well  as  all  the  familiar  but  continuously  changing 
challenges  (nuclear  and  biological  weapons,  ballistic  missile  and 
missile  defense  technology,  scientific  intelligence  gathering,  among 
others).  The  superb  research  done  in  the  Defense  Advance  Re-
search  Projects  Agency  and  other  parts  of  the  defense  research  es-
tablishment  has  contributed  to  United  States  security  for  genera-
tions,  and  I  regard  it  as  a  continuing  obligation  of  OSTP  to  help 
see that this continues. 

OSTP’s role in the security domain has an international coopera-
tion dimension as well and appropriately so, given the existence of 
many  security  problems  that  can  more  readily  be  addressed 
through  multilateral  agreements  and  cooperation  rather  than  uni-
lateral  action.  Nuclear  nonproliferation  is  a  prime  example,  but 
arms control agreements and mechanisms more broadly continue to 
be  an  important  element  of  our  national  security  portfolio.  Science 
and technology are essential elements of improving our capacity to 
verify  existing  arms  control  agreements,  as  well  as  to  help  decide 
what additional ones are in our national interest. 

In conclusion, while our country clearly faces immense challenges 
in  the  economic,  environmental,  health,  and  security  domains, 
among  others,  it  is  equally  clear  that  science  and  technology  can 
be  key  ingredients  in  turning  those  challenges  into  opportunities. 
But the pace of the advances we need for these purposes cannot be 
taken for granted. How quickly or slowly we get them is a substan-
tial  part  a  matter  of  policy.  The  Office  of  Science  and  Technology 
Policy can play a crucial role, in cooperation with the other Execu-
tive  Branch  agencies  and  the  Congress,  in  making  it  possible  for 
us to reap these rewards sooner rather than later. 

If  the  Senate  confirms  me  for  the  position  of  Director  of  OSTP, 
I would hope to work particularly closely with the members of this

Committee, which has long been a source of bipartisan support for 
the efforts needed to maintain America’s leadership across the fron-
tiers of science, engineering, and innovation. 

I thank you for your attention. I will be pleased to try to answer 

[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Dr. 

any questions you have. 

Holdren follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN P. HOLDREN, DIRECTOR-DESIGNATE, OFFICE OF 

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY, EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 

It is a singular honor and privilege to appear before this Committee as President 
Obama’s nominee for Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) 
within the Executive Office of the President. I contemplate the opportunity of serv-
ing  in  this  capacity,  if  confirmed  by  the  U.S.  Senate,  with  a  mixture  of  pride  and 
humility. 

I  am  proud  to  have  been  nominated  by  President  Obama  to  work  with  him  and 
the  Congress  to  sustain  and  strengthen  our  world-leading  science  and  engineering 
enterprises,  which  are  so  crucial  to  our  economic  prosperity,  our  security.  and  the 
quality of our environment, and to ensure the science and technology advice our pol-
icy-makers need is always the best it can be. 

But I am also humbled by the magnitude of these tasks, as well as by the respon-
sibility to live up to the standard set by the extraordinary line of distinguished sci-
entists  who  have  served  in  similar  roles  under  Republican  and  Democratic  Presi-
dents since MIT’s Vannevar Bush served as President Roosevelt’s science and tech-
nology advisor in World War II. 

Science and technology policy consists of two major strands: policy for science and 
technology—namely, the policies related to strengthening the research and develop-
ment  enterprise  in  the  public  and  private  sectors,  to  science  and  technology  edu-
cation and training, and to fostering the conditions under which advances in science 
and  technology  are  translated  into  economic,  security,  and  environmental  benefits 
for  society  at  large;  and  science  and  technology  for  policy—meaning  the  use  of  in-
sights from science and engineering in the formation of those parts of economic pol-
icy,  defense  policy,  space  policy,  health  policy,  environmental  policy,  agricultural 
policy,  and  so  on,  where  such  insights  are  needed  to  help  shape  sensible  policies. 
OSTP  has  the  great  challenge  of  covering  this  wide  and  critically  important  ter-
rain  in  the  White  House,  and  in  interaction  with  other  Executive  Branch  agencies 
and  the  Congress,  with  a  modest  staff  and  budget.  This  requires  recruiting  very 
high-caliber people both for the professional staff and for the volunteer but very sen-
ior  advisors  on  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology 
(PCAST),  and  using  the  connectivity  of  the  staff  and  PCAST  to  draw  on  the  advice 
and  analysis  of  the  best  of  the  rest  of  the  science  and  engineering  communities. 
Making  all  of  this  work  well  is  a  task  that,  if  confirmed,  I  would  give  great  atten-
tion. 

Besides efficiency in the use of the available human resources, a further key chal-
lenge  for  OSTP  is  carrying  out  its  responsibility  to  ensure  the  science  and  tech-
nology  advice  the  President  and  Congress  receives,  whether  from  inside  or  outside 
the government, is as objective and accurate as the state of the relevant fields per-
mits,  regardless  of  the  political  implications.  If  confirmed,  I  will  consider  this  one 
of my highest obligations, which would extend to working with the Federal agencies 
that  generate  and  process  scientific  and  technological  information  to  be  sure  the 
best  technical  judgments  of  the  scientists  and  engineers  working  there  are  never 
censored or distorted for ideological reasons. 

I would like to briefly offer some thoughts about major challenges facing our coun-
try  at  the  intersection  between  science  and  technology  and  the  economy,  the  envi-
ronment,  and  national  security,  and  how  the  work  of  OSTP  relates  to  addressing 
these challenges. 

American investments in science and engineering have driven most of the innova-
tions  that  underpin  our  economy  today.  A  wide  variety  of  studies  conclude  that  be-
tween  50  and  85  percent  of  the  growth  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  half-cen-
tury—and two-thirds of our productivity gains in recent decades—are directly attrib-
utable  to  scientific  and  technological  advances.  In  today’s  time  of  economic  crisis, 
we must resist the temptation to reduce our investments in these foundations of our 
prosperity. 

U.S.  scientific  leadership  requires  both  creating  an  environment  that  encourages 
private  investment  in  research  and  development  while  maintaining  strong  and  bal-

anced Federal research programs that support the promising areas of R&D that are 
too far from obvious application, too uncertain in outcome, too costly, or too related 
to public as opposed to private goods to attract private funding. 

In  this  connection,  I  want  to  give  special  mention  to  the  importance  of  R&D  in 
our  space  program.  Maintaining  and  expanding  our  capabilities  in  space  is  some-
times regarded as a ‘‘luxury’’ we should do less of in the face of more pressing earth-
bound  concerns.  But  that  would  be  false  economy.  Space  is  crucial  to  our  national 
defense; to civil as well as military communications and geo-positioning; to weather 
forecasting  and  storm  monitoring;  to  observation  and  scientific  study  of  the  condi-
tion of our home planet’s land, vegetation, oceans, and atmosphere; and to scientific 
study and exploration looking ‘‘outward’’ that is increasing our understanding of the 
physical universe and our place in it. 

I  also  want  to  note  the  importance  of  the  sustainability  and  predictability  of  the 
Federal  investment  in  science  and  engineering.  The  ‘‘boom  and  bust’’  cycles  that 
have characterized much Federal support in these domains over the past forty years 
are inefficient and disruptive of scientific progress. 

In  concert  with  helping  to  nurture  the  R&D  enterprise  in  general,  OSTP  has  an 
important  function  in  promoting  the  translation  of  the  results  of  R&D  into  new 
products  and  services  that  benefit  Americans  through  widespread  application.  This 
country  has  long  demonstrated  a  high  capacity  for  turning  novel  ideas  into  new 
businesses  and  improved  services  in  domains  ranging  from  medical  diagnostics,  to 
instant  access  to  information,  to  entertainment.  Fostering  this  capacity  for  trans-
lating  science  and  technology  into  widespread  benefit  will  be  crucial  in  rebuilding 
our economy as well in addressing our most pressing challenges in energy, environ-
ment, health, and national security. 

Development  of  new  technologies  and  providing  incentives  for  their  widespread 
adoption  will  be  particularly  crucial  at  the  demanding  intersection  of  energy,  na-
tional  security,  and  climate  change.  Providing  the  affordable  and  reliable  energy 
that our economic well-being requires while addressing the dangers of global climate 
change and over-dependence on oil from politically fragile regions are challenges de-
manding the utmost in collaboration among the relevant Executive Branch agencies, 
the Congress, and the private sector. 

While  climate  change  is  the  most  demanding  of  all  environmental  challenges  in 
terms  of  what  will  be  required  of  science  and  technology  in  order  to  bring  it  under 
control, there are many other environmental problems we dare not neglect: air qual-
ity, water quality, toxic substances in our soil and foods, the condition of the forests 
on  our  territory  and  the  oceans  on  our  borders,  and  biodiversity,  to  mention  some 
of the most important. 

I  know  this  Committee  is  well  aware  that  bringing  science  and  engineering  to 
bear on solving these problems and thereby improving the environmental component 
of  human  well-being  can  also  be  a  boost  to  the  economy,  not  a  drag,  by  virtue  of 
the jobs and investment associated with these efforts. 

Information technology has been a key driver of our productivity growth in recent 
decades  and  has  fundamentally  changed  the  way  people  worldwide  communicate 
and  work.  But  we  have  just  seen  the  beginning  of  what  can  be  achieved.  Informa-
tion technology has vast potential to improve health care, increase energy efficiency, 
monitor  climate  and  other  environmental  conditions,  and  manage  the  immense 
amounts of data from scientific efforts from the Human Genome Project to the Large 
Hadron Collider. 

Additionally,  we  can  and  should  use  existing  information  technologies—and  the 
better  ones  yet  to  come—to  bring  the  U.S.  Government  into  the  21st  century  by 
streamlining internal operations, cutting costs, increasing information security, and 
making  Federal  agencies  more  responsive  to  inputs  from  outside  the  government. 
Better use of the existing and new information technologies will also be a key in-
gredient in the improvement of K–12, college, and university education in this coun-
try,  not  only  to  produce  the  future  cohorts  of  scientists,  engineers,  and  mathemati-
cians  we  will  need,  but  also  to  upgrade  the  country’s  entire  workforce  and  provide 
Americans  with  the  tools  they  need  to  participate  successfully  in  our  democracy  in 
a milieu where science, technology, and information are becoming ever more impor-
tant. 

Last, but certainly not least, I want to mention the crucial roles that science and 
technology  play  in  our  country’s  capacity  to  deal  with  threats  to  our  security  both 
at  home  and  abroad.  These  include  the  need  to  address  complex  new  challenges— 
asymmetric  conflicts,  urban  operations,  peacekeeping  missions,  cyber  threats,  and

Projects  Agency  and  other  parts  of  the  defense  research  establishment  has  contrib-
uted  to  U.S.  security  for  generations,  and  I  regard  it  is  a  continuing  obligation  of 
OSTP to help see that this continues. 

The  ‘‘national  security’’  and  ‘‘international  affairs’’  aspects  of  OSTP’s  role  in  the 
security domain are, of course, tightly intertwined, not least because there are many 
security  problems  that  either  can  only  be  solved  or  are  most  easily  solved  through 
multilateral agreements and cooperation rather than unilateral action. Nuclear non-
proliferation  is  a  prime  example,  but  arms-control  agreements  and  mechanisms 
more broadly continue to be an important element of our national-security portfolio. 
Science  and  technology  are  essential  elements  of  improving  our  capacity  to  verify 
existing arms-control agreements, as well as to help decide what additional ones are 
in our national interest, and OSTP has a role to play in that. 

Another  aspect  of  OSTP’s  responsibilities  in  the  global  arena  relates  to  inter-
national research partnerships in science and in the technologies needed to address 
challenges  that  can  only  be  surmounted  by  multilateral  collaborations,  such  as  cli-
mate change, oil-import vulnerabilities, and the condition of the world’s oceans. The 
cost  and  complexity  of  cutting-edge  accelerators,  telescopes,  and  certain  experi-
mental  energy  technologies  (such  as  the  ITER  fusion  experiment)  are  good  reason 
in  themselves  for  sharing  the  costs  and  risks  internationally.  I  have  been  involved 
in international cooperation on fusion and other energy technologies since 1971, and 
if confirmed by the Senate I will be most eager to put the insights derived from that 
experience to good use in OSTP. 

In conclusion, while our country clearly faces immense challenges in the economic, 
environmental,  health,  and  security  domains,  among  others,  it  is  equally  clear  that 
science  and  technology  can  be  key  ingredients  in  turning  those  challenges  into  op-
portunities.  It  is  likewise  true  that  in  science  itself  we  are  on  the  threshold  of  re-
markable new discoveries about the universe, about how our own planet and its liv-
ing  systems  work,  and  about  how  we  learn,  think,  and  remember.  And  we  are  on 
the verge of huge advances in computing and other information systems, in biotech, 
in nanotech, in greentech, and in the intersection of these domains. 

But  the  pace  of  these  advances  is  not  automatic.  How  quickly  or  slowly  we  get 
them is in substantial part a matter of policy. The Office of Science and Technology 
Policy in the Executive Office of the President can play a crucial role, in cooperation 
with  the  other  Executive  Branch  agencies  and  the  Congress,  in  making  it  possible 
for us to reap these rewards sooner rather than later. 

If the Senate confirms me for the position of Director of the Office of Science and 
Technology  Policy,  I  would  hope  to  work  particularly  closely  with  the  members  of 
this  Committee,  which  has  long  been  a  source  of  steady,  bipartisan  support  for  the 
efforts  needed  to  maintain  America’s  leadership  across  on  the  frontiers  of  science, 
engineering, and innovation. 

I will be pleased to try to answer any questions you may have.

13.  Have  you  ever  been  a  candidate  for  and/or  held  a  public  office  (elected,  non- 
elected,  or  appointed)?  If  so,  indicate  whether  any  campaign  has  any  outstanding 
debt, the amount, and whether you are personally liable for that debt. 

No, nothing in this category. 
14.  Itemize  all  political  contributions  to  any  individual,  campaign  organization, 
political  party,  political  action  committee,  or  similar  entity  of  $500  or  more  for  the 
past  10  years.  Also  list  all  offices  you  have  held  with,  and  services  rendered  to,  a 
state or national political party or election committee during the same period. 

Our  political  contributions  have  been  modest  and  we  have  not  kept  good  records 
of them. To the best of my recollection, those in the last 10 years have been as fol-
lows: 

My wife and I made contributions totaling $2,000 to the Presidential campaign 
of President-elect Barack Obama in 2008. 
We contributed (I believe) $1,000 to the Presidential campaign of Senator John 
Kerry in 2004. 
We contributed (I believe) $1,000 to the Presidential campaign of Vice President 
Gore in 2000. 
We contributed (I believe) $500 to one or more of Senator John Kerry’s re-elec-
tion campaigns. 
We contributed (I believe) $500 to one or two of Congressman Rush Holt’s elec-
tion campaigns. 

I provided modest amounts of advice on climate-change and energy issues to both 
the  Clinton  and  Obama  Presidential  campaigns  during  the  primaries,  and  subse-
quently to the Obama campaign during the general election. I was designated a sur-
rogate  for  Senator  Obama  on  energy  and  climate-change  issues  during  the  general 
election but never performed in this role. 

I  was  a  member  of  Scientists  and  Engineers  for  Kerry  during  the  2004  Presi-
dential campaign and gave a number of speeches in this role in Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
and New Mexico. 

I was a member of Scientists and Engineers for Gore during the 2000 Presidential 
campaign  and  participated  in  some  conference-call  meetings  on  strategy  for  mobi-
lizing  support  for  Vice  President  Gore  in  the  science  and  engineering  communities. 
I  have  held  no  other  offices  or  rendered  any  other  services  for  state  or  national 

political parties or action committees in this period.

18.  Given  the  current  mission,  major  programs,  and  major  operational  objectives 
of  the  department/agency  to  which  you  have  been  nominated,  what  in  your  back-
ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualifies  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in the Executive Office of the 
President has the responsibility to provide independent advice to the President and 
Vice President on the science and technology (S&T) aspects of all of the policy issues 
with  which  they  are  concerned,  including  national  and  homeland  security,  energy, 
environment, health, transportation, information infrastructure, agriculture, and the 
roles  of  science  and  technology  in  the  economy,  as  well  as  issues  of  the  S&T  work-
force  and  S&T  education  and  training.  OSTP  also  provides  input,  in  coordination 
with  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  on  the  S&T  content  of  the  President’s 
annual  budget  request  to  the  Congress  and  carries  out  a  variety  of  other  functions 
relating  to  the  two-way  communications  about  S&T  matters  between  the  Executive 
Office of the President and the Congress; among the relevant Executive Branch de-
partments,  agencies,  and  offices;  and  among  S&T  offices  and  ministries  around  the 
world. 

Assets  I  would  bring  to  the  role  of  OSTP  Director  in  leading  these  diverse  and 

complex efforts include: 

• unusually  broad  interdisciplinary  training  and  experience  across  multiple  sci-
entific  and  engineering  fields  and  substantive  focuses  (aerospace  engineering, 
space  science,  plasma  physics,  nuclear  weapons,  energy  technology,  climate- 
change  science,  technology  assessment),  plus  extensive  working  collaborations 
with  biologists,  economists,  and  political  scientists  on  the  interactions  of  phys-
ical, biological, and socioeconomic dimensions of national and global challenges; 
• substantial  experience  working  in  and  with  many  of  the  relevant  sectors  (uni-
versities,  national  laboratories,  corporations,  foundations  and  other  NGO’s, 
state  and  national  government,  and  a  wide  variety  of  international  S&T  agen-
cies and organizations); 

• close interactions on S&T issues with Members of Congress on both sides of the 
aisle  (dating  back  to  my  first  Congressional  testimony  before  the  Honorable 
George Brown, long-time Chair of the House Committee of Science, in 1970) and 
extending  to  work  with  Senators  Nunn,  Lugar,  and  Domenici  in  the  1990s  and 
2000s  on  nuclear  threat  reduction  in  Russia  and  with  Senators  Domenici  and 
Bingaman over the past few years on national energy legislation; 

• extensive experience in advising Executive Branch departments and agencies on 
S&T  matters  through,  e.g.,  my  membership  on  and  chairmanship  of  many  Na-
tional  Academies  committees  over  the  years  (advising  the  State  Department, 
Defense  Department,  Energy  Department,  and  National  Nuclear  Security  Ad-
ministration,  among  others),  my  service  on  the  first  Energy  Research  Advisory 
Board to the Secretary of Energy (1978–1979) and on subsequent advisory com-
mittees to the DOE on fusion energy through 1994; 

• my  experience  on  President  Clinton’s  Committee  of  Advisors  on  Science  and 
Technology,  lodged  administratively  in  OSTP,  from  its  inception  in  1994  until 
the transition of 2001 (during which time I led PCAST studies requested by the 
President  on  protecting  nuclear-weapon  materials  against  terrorists  and 
proliferators,  the  U.S.  fusion  energy  research  program,  U.S.  Federal  energy 
R&D  for  the  challenges  of  the  21st  century,  and  the  Federal  role  in  inter-
national cooperation on energy-technology innovation, as well as serving as U.S. 
co-chair  of  a  bilateral  U.S.-Russian  commission  on  plutonium  management  re-
porting to Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin); 

• my  experience  building  bipartisan  consensus  on  energy  and  climate-change 
issues through my co-chairmanship of the National Commission on Energy Pol-
icy; and

• long  and  systematic  study  of  the  S&T  advisory  apparatus  of  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment,  beginning  with  participation  in  the  hearings  and  deliberations  that 
led  to  establishment  of  the  Congressional  Office  of  Technology  Assessment  in 
1972  and  including  teaching  and  research  leadership  on  Federal  science  and 
technology  policy  in  my  role  as  Director  and  Faculty  Chair  of  the  program  on 
Science, Technology, and Public Policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Govern-
ment from 1996. 

In  the  last  connection,  I  want  to  add  that  I’ve  had  the  great  privilege  of  being 
mentored  by  and/or  working  closely  with  five  previous  Presidential  science  advi-
sors—George  Kistiakowsky  (Eisenhower),  Jerome  Wiesner  (Kennedy,  Johnson), 
Frank Press (Carter), Jack Gibbons (Clinton I), and Neal Lane (Clinton II). I worked 
very  closely  with  both  Dr.  Gibbons  and  Dr.  Lane,  and  with  all  of  their  OSTP  Asso-
ciate  Directors,  during  the  two  Clinton  terms.  And  I  am  well  acquainted  with  the 
current OSTP Director, Honorable John H. Marburger, having spent time with him 
discussing science and technology policy issues before and during his term. 

I want to serve in this position because I believe our country faces both immense 
challenges and immense opportunities across a range of important issues where the 
wise use of insights from science and applications of technology are going to be cru-
cial  in  determining  the  outcomes,  and  because  I  believe  the  OSTP  Director  can  po-
tentially play an important role in helping the administration and the Congress get 
the outcomes we need. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

Proper  management  and  accounting  controls  are  essential  in  any  governmental 
organization,  as  well  as  in  any  corporation  or  nonprofit.  The  fact  that  OSTP  is  a 
relatively  small  operation,  with  about  65  staff  and  an  annual  budget  of  about  $6 
million,  does  not  alter  that  reality  in  any  way.  And,  of  course,  the  Director  has  the 
primary  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  proper  management  and  accounting  con-
trols are in place and for overseeing their implementation. 

I  currently  manage  an  operation  of  similar  size  (50  staff,  annual  budget  of  about 
$8.5 million) in my role as President and Director of the Woods Hole Research Cen-
ter  (since  June  2005  and  member  of  the  Board  since  1994).  The  Center’s  books  are 
subject to the professional annual audits required of any such organization, as well 
as to annual audits by the Federal Government because of the grants and contracts 
we  hold  from  Federal  agencies.  Those  audits  have  been  spotless  during  my  tenure, 
as  they  were  during  the  tenure  of  my  predecessor.  (I  am  only  the  second  Director 
the Center has had since its founding in 1985.) 

I  have  also  managed  similar  sized  academic  operations  at  both  Harvard  and  the 
University  of  California,  Berkeley:  As  a  Trustee  of  the  MacArthur  Foundation  for 
14  years,  long-time  member  of  the  Budget  Committee  of  that  Board,  and  Chair  of 
its  Institutional  Policy  Committee  in  2002–5,  I  have  had  shared  responsibility  for 
overseeing the finances and management of a much larger organization. 

20.What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the department/agen-

cy, and why? 

1.  In  a  way,  the  biggest  challenging  facing  OSTP  is  and  always  has  been  how 
to meet its very diverse and substantial responsibilities with the small staff and 
budget  at  its  disposal.  This  challenge  translates  into  the  need  to  recruit  ex-
tremely talented, organized, and dedicated staff members—starting with the As-
sociate  Directors  but  extending  right  down  through  the  administrative  staff— 
who will be both ingenious and hard-working in order to get it all done. 
2.  Another  (and  related)  top  challenge  is  to  develop  the  needed  working  rela-
tionships—with the President and Vice President, with the OMB and NSC and 
NEC, with the other S&T-rich Executive Branch departments and agencies, and 
with the Congress—without which there is no hope of OSTP doing the job that 
is  needed  from  it.  Meeting  this  challenge  is  a  matter  of  investing  the  effort  to 
create  and  nurture  those  relationships  (an  effort  that  must  start  with  but  can-
not  be  limited  to  the  OSTP  Director),  which  means  a  lot  of  listening,  not  just 
talking. 
3. The challenges of process that I mentioned first are large, but not larger than 
the  challenges  of  substance  faced  by  OSTP  in  formulating  advice—augmenting 
that of the other relevant departments, agencies and offices and recognizing the 
prerogatives  of  the  Congress—about  S&T  and  the  economy,  S&T  and  national 
and  homeland  security,  S&T  for  national  and  global  public  health,  the  role  of 
S&T  in  addressing  the  energy/climate-change/oil-dependence  challenge,  and 
more. Distilling all this down to one challenge (as required by the question’s re-

15 

quest  for  a  total  of  only  three)  motivates  me  to  put  it  as  follows.  Our  society’s 
well-being  rests  equally  on  three  pillars:  economic  conditions  and  processes 
(jobs,  income,  wealth,  trade  . . .),  socio-political  conditions  and  processes  (na-
tional  and  homeland  security,  personal  safety,  justice,  equity,  access  to  and 
quality  of  health  care  and  education  . . .),  and  environmental  conditions  and 
processes  (clean  air  and  water,  functioning  nutrient  cycles,  a  stable  and  favor-
able climate . . .). All three pillars are essential, just as a three-legged stool col-
lapses  if  any  single  leg  fails.  The  challenge  facing  OSTP  and  all  other  organs 
of  government  that  deal  with  science  and  technology  is  to  help  figure  out  how 
government, business, academia, and foundations and other NGO’s can more ef-
fectively collaborate in developing and applying science and technology in ways 
that strengthen all three legs simultaneously. 

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 
other  continuing  dealings  with  business  associates,  clients,  or  customers.  Please  in-
clude information related to retirement accounts. 

I receive a circa 50%-time salary from Harvard University in connection with my 

professorship in the John F. Kennedy School of government. 

I receive a circa 50%-time salary from the Woods Hole Research Center in connec-

tion with my position as President and Director there. 

This  balance  shifts  to  approximately  70%–30%  in  favor  of  the  Woods  Hole  Re-
search Center in the summer and semesters when I am carrying a reduced teaching 
load. 

I  am  vested  in  the  retirement  plans  at  both  Harvard  and  the  Woods  Hole  Re-
search  Center.  I  am  also  vested  in  the  retirement  plan  at  the  University  of  Cali-
fornia,  Berkeley,  where  I  was  on  the  faculty  from  1993  to  1996,  and  in  the  TIAA– 
CREF retirement program in connection with earlier service at the Lawrence Liver-
more Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology. 

I have no deferred compensation arrangements with any of the institutions where 
I have been employed, and I have no other continuing business or financial dealings 
of any kind. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation, or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? If so, please explain. 

If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, I will take a public-service leave of absence from 
Harvard  University,  effective  immediately  upon  confirmation.  There  is  no  expecta-
tion  on  Harvard’s  part  or  mine  that  I  would  be  carrying  on  any  activity  or  practice 
at or for Harvard during the period of my service with the government. 

If confirmed by the Senate, I will resign my position at the Woods Hole Research 
Center,  effective  immediately  upon  confirmation.  There  is  no  expectation  on  the 
Center’s  part  or  mine  that  I  would  carry  on  any  activity  or  practice  at  or  for  the 
Woods Hole Research after confirmation to my government position. 

I  would  also  resign,  effectively  immediately  upon  confirmation,  from  all  boards 
and  other  advisory  positions  in  which  I  currently  serve,  and  I  would  undertake  no 
other commitments of this type during the period of my service in government. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated. 

In  connection  with  the  nomination  process,  I  have  consulted  with  the  Office  of 
Government  Ethics  and  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President’s  designated  agency 
ethics  official  to  identify  potential  conflicts  of  interest.  Any  potential  conflicts  of  in-
terest  will  be  resolved  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  an  ethics  agreement  that  I 
have entered into with the EOP’s designated agency ethics official. 

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have  had  during  the  last  10  years,  whether  for  yourself,  on  behalf  of  a  client,  or 
acting  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict 
of interest in the position to which you have been nominated: None. 

5. Describe any activity during the past 10 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public 
policy. 

In 1999, in my capacity as a member of President Clinton’s Committee of Advisors 
on Science and Technology, I chaired a PCAST study, at the President’s request, of 
the  Federal  role  in  international  cooperation  on  energy-technology  innovation.  The 
President’s intent was for this study’s arguments and recommendations to influence 
the relevant portions of his FY2001 budget request to the Congress, and it was also

16 

his  stated  hope  that  these  arguments  and  recommendations  would  influence  the 
Congress  to  approve  the  relevant  items  in  his  request.  At  his  direction,  following 
completion  of  the  report,  I  met  with  relevant  agency  heads  and  then  with  some  of 
the  Members  of  Congress  most  concerned  with  these  matters  to  explain  the  rec-
ommendations. 

From 2000 to 2002, I served as the Chair of a National Academy of Sciences Com-
mittee conducting a study originally requested from the Academy by President Clin-
ton on the topic of technical issues relating to ratification of the Comprehensive Nu-
clear Test Ban Treaty. This followed the Senate’s vote in 1999 not to consent to rati-
fication  of  the  indicated  treaty.  The  President’s  stated  intent  in  requesting  the 
study, which was ultimately delivered to the Bush administration and to the Senate 
Foreign  Relations  Committee  in  2002,  was  to  assemble  authoritative  information 
and  analysis  on  the  main  technical  issues  that  had  been  advanced  in  the  Senate 
debate  as  question  marks  about  the  wisdom  of  ratifying  the  treaty.  The  intent  was 
clearly  to  contribute  to  the  knowledge  base  for  a  yea  or  nay  vote  on  ratification  of 
the treaty if and when it was re-submitted to the Senate. 

From  1996  to  the  present  I  have  been  one  of  the  principal  investigators  of  a 
project  in  the  Belfer  Center  for  Science  and  International  Affairs  at  the  Kennedy 
School of Government called ‘‘Managing the Atom’’ and focusing, in part, on the ade-
quacy  of  the  programs  of  the  U.S.  Government  and  other  governments  to  keep  nu-
clear  weapons  and  nuclearweapon-useable  materials  out  of  the  hands  of  terrorists 
and proliferant states. Reports over the years from this project, which has been sup-
ported  mainly  by  the  Nuclear  Threat  Initiative  (Co-Chaired  by  Senator  Sam  Nunn 
and  Ted  Turner  and  led  by  former  Undersecretary  of  Energy  Charles  Curtis),  have 
made recommendations on opportunities, priorities, and budgets for the U.S. govern-
ment’s  efforts  in  this  domain.  These  recommendations,  some  authored  and  all  ap-
proved  by  me,  were  intended  to  influence  budget  requests  and  appropriations  and 
were  regularly  briefed  to  relevant  Executive  Branch  officials  and  Members  of  Con-
gress to try to achieve this. 

From  2002  to  the  present,  I  have  served  as  one  of  three  Co-Chairs  of  the  inde-
pendent,  foundation-funded,  bipartisan  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy, 
which  consists  of  prominent  experts  on  energy  technology,  policy,  and  regulation 
from  academia,  business,  labor,  and  NGO’s,  as  well  as  individuals  with  high-level 
state  and  Federal  Government  experience  in  the  energy  domain,  and  which  is  de-
voted  to  developing  consensus  recommendations  on  U.S.  energy  policy  that  might 
command  bipartisan  support  in  the  U.S.  Congress.  Our  December  2004  and  April 
2007  recommendations  (all  unanimous)  have  been  briefed  to  Executive  Branch  offi-
cials  and  relevant  Members  of  Congress  in  the  hope  of  constructively  influencing 
U.S. energy policy. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

In  connection  with  the  nomination  process,  I  have  consulted  with  the  Office  of 
Government  Ethics  and  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy’s  designated 
agency ethics official to identify potential conflicts of interest. Any potential conflicts 
of interest will be resolved in accordance with the terms of an ethics agreement that 
I  have  entered  into  with  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy’s  designated 
agency ethics official. 

C. LEGAL MATTERS 

1.  Have  you  ever  been  disciplined  or  cited  for  a  breach  of  ethics  by,  or  been  the 
subject of a complaint to any court, administrative agency, professional association, 
disciplinary committee, or other professional group? If so, please explain: No. 

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  any  Federal, 
State,  or  other  law  enforcement  authority  of  any  Federal,  State,  county,  or  munic-
ipal entity, other than for a minor traffic offense? If so, please explain: No. 

3.  Have  you  or  any  business  of  which  you  are  or  were  an  officer  ever  been  in-
volved  as  a  party  in  an  administrative  agency  proceeding  or  civil  litigation?  If  so, 
please explain: No. 

4.  Have  you  ever  been  convicted  (including  pleas  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere)  of 
any  criminal  violation  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense?  If  so,  please  explain:  No. 
5.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  race,  religion,  or  any  other  basis?  If  so,  please 
explain: No. 

6.  Please  advise  the  Committee  of  any  additional  information,  favorable  or  unfa-
vorable,  which  you  feel  should  be  disclosed  in  connection  with  your  nomination:  I 
believe  that  my  answers  to  this  questionnaire  have  disclosed  everything  of  rel-
evance.

D. RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMITTEE 

1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with deadlines for infor-

mation set by Congressional committees? Yes. 

2.  Will  you  ensure  that  your  department/agency  does  whatever  it  can  to  protect 
Congressional  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  from  reprisal  for  their  testimony  and 
disclosures? Yes. 

3.  Will  you  cooperate  in  providing  the  Committee  with  requested  witnesses,  in-
cluding technical experts and career employees, with firsthand knowledge of matters

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  We  decided  that  we  would  actually 
have  both  witnesses  give  testimony  back  to  back,  and  then  that 
would  encourage  us  to  cross-question  them  and  have  all  kinds  of 
fun. 

To  introduce  Dr.  Lubchenco  is  Senator  Ron  Wyden,  who  is  from 

the State of Oregon. So please proceed. 

STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator  WYDEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much.  As  an 
alum of this Committee, I know how much you value good science. 
I  have  worked  with  many  of  you  over  the  years  in  this  very  com-
mittee  room,  spent  a  number  of  years  I  think  on  the  perch  right 
next  to  Senator  Nelson.  So  we  appreciate  the  good  work  that  you 
all  do  to  promote  particularly  sensible  science  and  scientific  integ-
rity. 

And  Dr.  Jane  Lubchenco’s  career  has  essentially  been  built 
around those kinds of principles. She is a star on our faculty at Or-
egon  State  University.  But  when  you  look  at  her  extraordinary 
track  record,  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  she  is  the  bionic  woman  of 
good science. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  WYDEN.  She  has  managed  to  do  just  about  everything, 

winning respect in every quarter. 

For  example,  she  has  already  served  as  scientific  advisor  to  two 
different  administrations.  She  served  President  Clinton,  for  exam-
ple, for two terms on the National Science Board, and she was part 
of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  in  a  climate  change  report  to 
President  George  Herbert  Walker  Bush.  So  I  think  all  of  us  who 
have  toiled  on  this  climate  change  issue  understand  it  is  not  ex-
actly  for  the  faint-hearted.  You  are  going  to  have  to  be  bipartisan, 
and  Dr.  Lubchenco  has  already  shown  with  her  previous  service

and  the  respect  she  won  in  two  different  administrations  that  she 
is a very up to that. 

At  Oregon  State,  Dr.  Lubchenco  has  had  the  opportunity  to  con-
front  many  of  the  issues  that  NOAA  is  going  to  face  on  a  daily 
basis.  She  studied  marine  ecosystems  around  the  globe.  She  has 
worked to bring her conclusions home, again advising policymakers 
of both political parties. 

She  was  a  recipient  of  the  2002  Heinz  Award  for  the  environ-
ment. I note Senator Kerry’s long history on these issues. And here 
is  what  the  Heinz  Award  said  in  recognizing  her.  ‘‘She  has  shown 
that while science should be excellent, pure, and dispassionate, sci-
entists should not sacrifice a right and must not ignore the respon-
sibility  to  communicate  their  knowledge  about  how  the  earth  is 
changing  or  to  say  what  they  believe  will  be  the  likely  con-
sequences of different policy options.’’ 

So  we  have  in  Dr.  Lubchenco  somebody  who  has  been  driven  by 
the  effort  to  dispassionately  find  the  facts.  Her  scientific  contribu-
tions  are  recognized  worldwide.  She  has  been  named  one  of  the 
most  highly  cited  ecologists  in  the  world,  and  as  I  mentioned,  for 
her great record, she has repeatedly been recognized. 

Let  me  close  by  saying,  Mr.  Chairman  and  colleagues,  we  so 
value  Dr.  Lubchenco  in  Oregon.  We  would  not  give  her  up  under 
normal  circumstances.  She  is  such  a  valuable  asset  and  has  won 
so  much  respect  from  scientists  across  the  philosophical  spectrum 
and policymakers that we would not give her up unless there were 
a chance to come to the aid of our country at a critical time. Every-
one  in  this  room  understands  that  if  we  are  going  to  make  endur-
ing  changes  in  climate  change,  they  are  going  to  have  to  be  bipar-
tisan. They are going to have to be driven by good science and find-
ing  the  facts.  That  is  what  Dr.  Lubchenco’s  career  has  been  all 
about,  and  it  is  why  I  come  before  you  today  to  give  her  a  rec-
ommendation this morning and look forward to her serving in this 
critical position. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and colleagues. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Wyden, very much. 
Dr.  Lubchenco,  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony  which  is  just 

redolent with enthusiasm and promise. 

STATEMENT OF DR. JANE LUBCHENCO, UNDERSECRETARY- 
DESIGNATE OF COMMERCE FOR OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE, 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Hutchison, 
distinguished members of the Committee. It is a deep honor for me 
to be here today. 

Senator Wyden, I greatly appreciate your very kind remarks, and 
I  value  the  time  that  you  took  to  come  here  today.  I  know  it  is  a 
very, very busy day. 

I  am  here  with  the  love  and  support  of  a  wonderful  family,  and 
I  wish  to  thank  my  91-year-old  mother,  a  pediatrician,  my  late  fa-
ther,  a  surgeon  and  Army  captain  for  enabling  their  six  daughters 
to pursue their dreams while instilling in each of us a strong sense 
of values, family, love, and heritage. I am grateful to my sisters too 
for  teaching  me  the  merits  of  compromise  and  balance.  I  am  very 
pleased that my husband Bruce and my son Duncan are able to be

here today, and I am grateful to them for their continuing love and 
encouragement.  And  my  thanks  to  my  wonderful  staff  and  col-
leagues  in  Oregon  and  around  the  country  for  their  overwhelming 
support. 

I  first  became  enamored  with  the  oceans  during  a  college  class 
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. To a Colorado native, life in the sea 
seemed  exotic  and  endlessly  fascinating.  Little  did  I  realize  then 
that  life  in  the  oceans  is  also  essential  to  human  well-being  and 
prosperity along the coasts, as well as inland. 

I  have  been  a  professor  of  marine  biology  at  Oregon  State  Uni-
versity  since  1977.  I  lead  a  large  team  of  scientists  studying  the 
marine ecosystems off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and Cali-
fornia.  We  focus  on  understanding  how  the  ecosystem  is  changing 
and  how  society  might  recover  and  sustain  the  jobs,  recreational 
opportunities,  healthy  seafood,  and  wild  beauty  that  all  depend 
upon  healthy  ocean  ecosystems.  I  have  spent  my  entire  career  fo-
cused  on  connections,  the  connections  between  land,  sea,  and  air 
and the connections between people and ecosystems. 

I  would  bring  to  NOAA  a  firm  belief  that  science  should  inform, 
not  dictate  decisionmaking,  a  deep  respect  for  multiple  points  of 
view, a wealth of experience leading complex projects and organiza-
tions.  And  I  believe  that  these  experiences  have  prepared  me  well 
to serve the Nation by leading NOAA. 

NOAA is, indeed, the crown jewel of the Commerce Department. 
It  is  an  indispensable  partner  with  the  private  sector  in  creating 
jobs  along  the  coasts  and  inland.  NOAA  helps  protect  lives  and 
property  in  times  of  natural  disaster.  It  is  a  trusted  steward  of  a 
bounty of marine and coastal resources, and it is the premier Gov-
ernment agency for applied science. 

Working  with  you  and  using  the  best  available  science  as  our 
guide,  here  is  what  I  think  we  could  do.  We  can  add  hundreds  of 
millions  of  new  dollars  to  the  economy  by  bringing  back  fisheries, 
both  commercial  and  recreational.  We  can  improve  fishing  and 
farming,  lower  insurance  rates,  and  make  air  travel  safer  by  im-
proving  weather  forecasting.  We  can  spur  the  creation  of  new  in-
dustries,  for  example,  by  improving  climate  forecasting  to  enable 
better  decisions  about  infrastructure,  public  safety,  and  consumer 
needs.  And  we  can  protect  and  recover  the  bays,  beaches,  rivers, 
and oceans that amaze, inspire, and connect us all. 

My vision for NOAA is strongly colored by the experiences I had 
traveling  around  the  country  with  the  Pew  Oceans  Commission 
doing public hearings in many coastal communities. The consistent 
theme  that  we  heard  from  CEOs  to  fishermen’s  wives,  from  farm-
ers  to  coastal  residents  was  the  same:  an  intimate  connection  be-
tween people and oceans. 50 percent of Americans live on the coast. 
Most of the rest love to visit clean beaches and eat healthy seafood. 
Indeed,  60  percent  of  the  country’s  GDP  comes  from  coastal  com-
munities. 

Now  our  country  must  rise  to  a  new  challenge,  dealing  with  the 
impacts  of  a  changing  climate.  I  have  heard  firsthand  from  busi-
ness  leaders  and  elected  officials  about  the  urgent  need  for  better 
information about likely local impacts of climate change. From con-
cern about droughts and sea level rise to changes in the chemistry

of  the  ocean,  there  is  a  real  hunger  for  more  and  better  informa-
tion. 

If  confirmed,  I  will  work  to  create  a  National  Climate  Service 
similar  to  the  National  Weather  Service  within  NOAA.  NOAA  is 
the best agency in the Government to synthesize the scientific data 
on  climate  change  and  create  products  and  services  that  can  be 
used  by  the  public  to  guide  important  decisions  such  as  where  to 
build  a  road  or  a  wind  turbine.  This  idea  has  been  studied  by  the 
agency,  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  and  by  this  com-
mittee.  It  is  an  idea  whose  time  has  come,  and  I  would  like  to 
make it happen. 

Being the Administrator of NOAA is a big job. Some of the chal-
lenges  I  know  well:  ending  overfishing,  anticipating  the  con-
sequences  of  climate  change,  preparing  for  natural  disasters  in  a 
time  when  resources  are  tight,  restoring  ecosystems  on  which  we 
depend  for  food,  water,  livelihoods  and  other  challenges  I  am  just 
learning.  Getting  the  satellite  program  back  on  track  is  chief 
among them. 

If confirmed, I would work hard with Members of this Committee 
and  the  Senate  and  the  House  in  realizing  the  great  potential  in-
herent  in  NOAA.  Together,  we  can  provide  America  the  best  cli-
mate  change  science,  restore  her  oceans’  vitality,  and  recharge  our 
economy, putting us on a path to sustainability. 

Again,  thank  you  very  much  for  your  courtesy,  Mr.  Chairman 
and  members  of  this  committee.  I  look  forward  to  your  questions. 
[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Dr. 

Lubchenco follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. JANE LUBCHENCO, UNDERSECRETARY-DESIGNATE OF 

COMMERCE FOR OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 

Mr. Chairman, Senator Hutchison, and distinguished members of the Committee, 
I  am  honored  to  appear  before  you  as  President  Obama’s  nominee  for  Undersecre-
tary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  and  Administrator  of  the  National 
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration.  I  am  grateful  for  the  courtesy  shown  to 
me by the Members of this Committee with whom I have visited over the past sev-
eral weeks, and I am eager to continue and deepen our dialogue. 

I  come  before  you  today  with  the  love  and  support  of  a  wonderful  family.  I  wish 
to  thank  my  91-year  old  mother,  a  pediatrician,  and  my  late  father,  a  surgeon  and 
Army  Captain,  for  encouraging  and  enabling  their  six  daughters  to  pursue  their 
dreams while instilling in each of us a deep sense of values, family, love and herit-
age. I thank my sisters for teaching me the merits of compromise, humility and bal-
ance. I’m pleased that my husband Bruce and son Duncan are able to be here today 
and  I’m  grateful  to  them  for  their  continuing  encouragement  and  love.  And  I  wish 
to  thank  my  staff  and  colleagues  in  Oregon  and  around  the  country  for  all  of  their 
support. 

I was fortunate to grow up in Colorado where I developed a deep appreciation for 
the land—hunting and fishing with my father, hiking and camping with family and 
friends.  I  also  grew  to  understand  the  pervasive  importance  of  weather,  especially 
from  family  stories  about  the  extended  droughts  in  South  Carolina  in  the  late  20’s 
that triggered my paternal grandparents’ move to Colorado. 

I  first  became  enamored  with  the  oceans  during  a  college  class  in  Woods  Hole, 
Massachusetts. To a Colorado native, the life in the sea seemed exotic and endlessly 
fascinating.  Little  did  I  realize  then  that  life  in  the  oceans  is  also  essential  to 
human  prosperity  and  well-being—both  along  the  coasts  and  inland.  My  exposure 
to the oceans was love at first sight and my life’s work was set in motion. 

I am currently a professor of marine biology and zoology at Oregon State Univer-
sity,  where  I  have  taught  since  1977.  I  lead  a  large  interdisciplinary  team  of  sci-
entists  studying  the  large  marine  ecosystem  off  the  coasts  of  Washington,  Oregon 
and California. We focus on understanding how the ecosystem is changing and how 
society  might  recover  and  sustain  the  jobs,  recreational  opportunities,  healthy  sea-

food and wild beauty that all depend upon healthy ocean ecosystems. Indeed, I have 
spent my entire career focused on the connections between the land, sea and air and 
between people and the land and ocean. 

Throughout  my  teaching,  leadership  of  large  organizations,  and  participation  in 
public service, I have emphasized the important role of clear scientific input in deci-
sionmaking.  I  have  stressed  my  belief  that  science  should  inform,  not  dictate,  deci-
sion-making. 

I have gained a wealth of experience in leading large, complex projects and orga-
nizations  and  serving  on  Boards  of  Directors  for  major  foundations  and  organiza-
tions. These projects, organizations and boards include the American Association for 
the  Advance  of  Science,  the  International  Council  for  Science,  the  Partnership  for 
Interdisciplinary  Studies  of  Coastal  Oceans,  the  National  Science  Board,  the  David 
and  Lucile  Packard  Foundation,  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium,  the  Environmental 
Defense Fund and Oregon Governor Kulongoski’s Advisory Group on Global Warm-
ing.  I  believe  that  these  experiences  have  prepared  me  well  to  serve  the  Nation  by 
leading NOAA. 

My  students  have  always  been  an  inspiration.  Young  minds  are  adept  at  chal-
lenging one’s thinking and introducing novel ideas. If I was talking with them right 
now  about  NOAA,  and  why  I’m  so  excited  to  have  the  honor  of  being  nominated  to 
lead the agency, I’d say this. 

NOAA  is  the  crown  jewel  of  the  Commerce  Department.  It  is  an  indispensible 
partner  with  the  private  sector  in  creating  jobs  and  growth  all  along  our  coasts.  It 
is also the trusted steward of a bounty of marine resources that belong to all Ameri-
cans.  It  helps  to  protect  lives  and  property  in  times  of  natural  disaster.  And  it  is 
the premier government agency for applied science. 

I tell my students that science is more than just fascinating knowledge, it is also 
useful  knowledge.  I  believe  passionately  that  science  should  inform  our  decisions. 
I  can  think  of  no  better  place  to  use  my  knowledge  and  experience  than  at  NOAA. 
Working  with  you,  and  using  the  best  available  science  as  our  guide,  here  is  what 
I think we can do. 

improving weather forecasting. 

back fisheries—both commercial and recreational. 

• We  can  add  hundreds  of  millions  of  new  dollars  to  the  economy  by  bringing 
• We  can  improve  farming,  lower  insurance  rates,  and  make  air  travel  safer  by 
• We  can  spur  the  creation  of  new  industries.  Improved  climate  forecasting,  for 
example,  can  serve  as  the  backbone  of  new  enterprises  helping  businessmen 
and  public  servants  alike  make  better  decisions  about  infrastructure,  public 
safety, consumer needs and product research and development. 
• We can protect and recover bays, beaches, rivers and oceans that amaze, inspire 

and connect us all. 

My love of oceans, scientific knowledge and ability to find common ground among 
diverse perspectives led to my service on the Pew Oceans Commission and the Joint 
Ocean  Commission  Initiative.  I  have  spent  a  good  deal  of  time  thinking  about  the 
future of NOAA and its work. My vision for NOAA is strongly colored by the experi-
ence  of  traveling  around  the  country  doing  public  hearings  with  the  Commission. 
We listened to people from all walks of life—on the coasts and in the heartland. The 
consistent theme from CEOs to fishermen’s wives, from farmers to coastal residents 
was  the  same:  There  is  an  intimate  connection  between  Americans  and  our  coasts 
and  oceans.  Fifty  percent  of  us  live  in  coastal  areas;  most  of  the  rest  love  to  visit 
beaches and eat seafood. Sixty percent of the country’s GDP is generated in coastal 
communities.  NOAA  and  Congress  have  the  job  of  protecting  the  oceans  and  Great 
Lakes. But it is not just protecting nature for its own sake. Jobs and a healthy envi-
ronment go hand-in-hand—in the ocean as well as on the land. 

Now  our  country  must  rise  to  a  new  challenge—dealing  with  the  impacts  of  the 
changing  climate.  In  my  work  on  the  Ocean  Commissions,  I  heard  firsthand  from 
businesses  and  state  and  local  governments  about  the  need  for  better  information 
and  predictions  about  the  impacts  of  climate  change  in  communities  all  across  this 
country. From concern about droughts and sea level rise to changes in the chemistry 
of  the  ocean,  there  is  a  real  hunger  for  more  and  better  information.  If  confirmed, 
I will work to create a National Climate Service, which would be similar to the Na-
tional Weather Service, within NOAA. NOAA is the best agency in the government 
to synthesize the scientific data on climate change and create products and services 
that  can  be  used  by  the  public  to  guide  important  decisions  such  as  where  to  build 
a  road  or  wind  turbines.  This  idea  has  been  studied  by  the  agency,  the  National 
Academy  of  Sciences,  and  by  members  of  this  Committee.  It  is  an  idea  whose  time 
has come, and I would like to make it happen.

Being the Administrator of NOAA is a big job. Some of the challenges I know well 
from my work: Ending overfishing; anticipating the consequences of climate change; 
preparing  for  natural  disasters  in  a  time  when  resources  are  tight;  restoring  eco-
systems on which we depend for food, water and livelihoods. 

Other  challenges  I’m  just  learning.  Getting  the  satellite  program  back  on  track 
is  chief  among  them.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  strengthen  NOAA  as 
a  partner  with  business  in  creating  economic  growth  and  as  a  trusted  steward  of 
America’s oceans, Great Lakes and coasts. 

I  have  great  admiration  for  the  legions  of  dedicated  scientists  and  other  talented 
professionals at NOAA. I know that this Committee and the Congress has been very 
supportive of NOAA and its work. I relish the opportunity to lead the team. I pledge 
to bring transparency, fairness, integrity and accountability to the job, using a con-
sultative  and  collaborative  approach.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work  hard  with  the  Mem-
bers  of  this  Committee,  the  Senate,  and  the  House  in  realizing  the  great  potential 
inherent  in  NOAA.  Together  we  can  provide  America  the  best  climate  change 
science, restore her ocean’s vitality and recharge our economy, putting us on a path 
to sustainability.

pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

NOAA  is  the  Nation’s  premier  science  agency  focusing  on  exploring,  under-
standing, explaining and managing our oceans and atmosphere. My scientific career 
has  been  spent  at  exactly  this  nexus.  My  research  has  focused  on  the  oceans  and 
on the connections between the land, sea and air. Through my teaching and partici-
pation  in  public  service,  I  have  emphasized  the  role  of  clear  and  current  scientific 
input  in  decision-making.  I  have  also  always  stressed  my  belief  that  science  should 
inform  decision-making.  It  should  not  dictate  decisions.  I  have  led  large,  complex 
projects  and  organizations  and  served  on  Boards  of  Directors  for  major  foundations 
and  non-governmental  organizations.  These  projects,  organizations  and  boards  in-
clude  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science,  the  International 
Council for Science, the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans, 
the  National  Science  Board,  the  David  and  Lucile  Packard  Foundation,  the  Mon-
terey Bay Aquarium, and the Environmental Defense Fund. I believe that I can uti-
lize my knowledge, skills and experience to serve the Nation by leading NOAA. 

19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

As the top executive in NOAA, it will be my responsibility, if confirmed, to make 
sure  that  the  agency  has  proper  management  systems  and  accounting  controls  in 
place  and  working,  and  I  take  that  responsibility  very  seriously.  I  will  personally 
devote  time,  resources  and  attention  to  making  sure  that  the  proper  internal  con-
trols are in place and that there is oversight of the ‘‘business’’ of NOAA. In my more 
than thirty-year career as a scientist, simultaneously managing multiple ongoing re-
search  projects,  and  other  scientific,  academic,  and  policy  endeavors,  I  have  gained 
a  wealth  of  experience  in  running  an  enterprise.  I  understand  firsthand  how  to 
manage  budgets,  build  a  management  team,  maximize  human  resources,  and  solve 
problems to deliver tangible results. 

20.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/ 

agency, and why? 

I believe the top three challenges facing NOAA are the satellite program, fisheries 
management, and ensuring that the Nation is prepared to deal with the impacts of 
climate change, including changes in weather patterns and disasters. Fixing the sat-
ellite  program  is  key  to  NOAA’s  ability  to  forecast  accurately  extreme  weather 
events. The current problems must be solved. The cost overruns are a serious drain 
on  the  NOAA  and  Federal  budgets  and  they  reflect  poorly  on  the  agency.  Ending 
overfishing  by  2011  is  required  by  the  newly  amended  Magnuson-Stevens  Act,  and 
will require making difficult choices involving fishing jobs and fishing communities. 
It will require time, attention and an ability to balance competing interests. Climate 
change  is  one  of  the  greatest  challenges  facing  our  nation;  NOAA  can  play  a  key 
role  in  helping  us  to  forecast  likely  changes  and  adapt  to  the  inevitable  impacts  of 
climate change that we will face in the years ahead. I look forward to working with 
the Committee on all of these challenges, if I am confirmed.

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation, or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? If so, please explain. 

Oregon State University (OSU). If confirmed, I will go on leave of absence without 

pay from my faculty position at Oregon State University. 

I  will  continue  to  participate  in  the  State  of  Oregon  Employees  Retirement  Sys-
tem.  No  further  contributions  will  be  made  by  Oregon  State  University  during  my 
leave of absence. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated. 

I  have  worked  with  the  Office  of  Government  Ethics  to  develop  an  agreement  on 

avoiding potential and actual conflicts of interest. 

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have  had  during  the  last  10  years,  whether  for  yourself,  on  behalf  of  a  client,  or 
acting  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict 
of interest in the position to which you have been nominated. 

I  have  worked  with  the  Office  of  Government  Ethics  to  develop  an  agreement  on 

avoiding potential and actual conflicts of interest. 

5. Describe any activity during the past 10 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public 
policy. 

I  have  never  been  a  registered  lobbyist.  I  believe  that  it  is  important  to  provide 
scientific information to policymakers in order to help inform their decisions. For ex-
ample, I have testified before Congress on numerous occasions, briefed the President 
and  Vice  President,  served  on  The  National  Science  Board  and  Committees  of  the 
National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  National  Academy  of  Engineering,  and  par-
ticipated  in  nongovernmental  activities  providing  input  to  governmental  bodies  or 
individuals,  such  as  the  Aspen  Institute  Congressional  Program.  These  activities 
have all been listed in answers to earlier questions. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

I  have  worked  with  the  Office  of  Government  Ethics  to  develop  an  agreement  on 
avoiding  potential  and  actual  conflicts  of  interest.  Should  other  issues  arise,  I  will 
seek  the  counsel  of  the  Office  of  Government  Ethics  and  where  appropriate,  would 
recuse myself from a decision or take any other steps necessary to in order to avoid 
an actual or appearance of a conflict of interest. 

C. LEGAL MATTERS 

1.  Have  you  ever  been  disciplined  or  cited  for  a  breach  of  ethics  by,  or  been  the 
subject of a complaint to any court, administrative agency, professional association, 
disciplinary committee, or other professional group? If so, please explain. 

Our  neighborhood  association  was  involved  in  a  water  dispute  in  which  a  subset 
of households filed suit against the rest of the group. My husband and I were named 
in the group that was sued. It was resolved out of court. 

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  any  Federal, 
State,  or  other  law  enforcement  authority  of  any  Federal,  State,  county,  or  munic-

3.  Have  you  or  any  business  of  which  you  are  or  were  an  officer  ever  been  in-
volved  as  a  party  in  an  administrative  agency  proceeding  or  civil  litigation?  If  so, 
please explain: Please see C.1 above. 

4.  Have  you  ever  been  convicted  (including  pleas  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere)  of 
any  criminal  violation  other  than  a  minor  traffic  offense?  If  so,  please  explain:  No. 
5.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  race,  religion,  or  any  other  basis?  If  so,  please 
explain: No.

cluding technical experts and career employees, with firsthand knowledge of matters 
of interest to the Committee? Yes. 

4.  Are  you  willing  to  appear  and  testify  before  any  duly  constituted  committee  of 
the  Congress  on  such  occasions  as  you  may  be  reasonably  requested  to  do  so?  Yes. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Thank you for your state-

ment. 

You have talked about the importance of the integrity of science, 
and  I  mentioned  the  Johns  Hopkins/Isaac  Newton  approach.  You 
follow  the  truth  wherever  it  is.  I  am  not  a  scientist.  If  I  were 
trained  as  a  scientist,  I  think  I  would  rigidly  and  forever  believe 
what you both said. 

It  gets  difficult  in  government  because  there  are  a  lot  of  other 
points of view. Take climate change. I support that. There are a lot 
of people who produce coal in my State who are maybe less enthu-
siastic about it, but so be it. 

How  do  you  protect  the  integrity—this  is  for  each  of  you—of 
science?  Because  science  is  something  which,  through  your  work, 
has  led  you  to  a  conclusion—perhaps  two,  but  at  least,  let  us  say, 
a conclusion: this is a better way to go than this way. How do you 
protect  that  when  you  are  being  buffeted  by  a  variety  of  other  in-
terests within government? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  might  begin  and  I  will  let 
my colleague continue. I believe very firmly that the role of science 
is  to  inform  our  understanding  and  inform  our  decisions.  The 
science  does  not  tell  us  what  to  do.  It  helps  us  understand  what 
is  happening,  how  things  are  changing,  and  what  the  likely  con-
sequences of different policy choices might be. It is one of a number 
of factors that I believe should be taken into account in making po-
litical  decisions.  Those  decisions  will  also  include  values,  econom-
ics,  politics,  and  other  kinds  of  information.  My  hope  is  that  the 
scientific  information  would  be  available  in  relevant  and  under-
standable  ways  to  help  inform  those  decisions  but  not  necessarily 
to  dictate  any  particular  outcome.  The  choices  that  you  make  are 
often social decisions that should rely on the science. 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Let  me  just  add  to  what  my  colleague  has  said, 
with which I fully agree. I often say to my students in the first lec-
ture in a course I have taught for many years about environmental 
and resource science for policy that the scientific facts are never ev-
erything in decision-making and policymaking, but they are usually 
something.  They  are  relevant  in  various  ways  to  the  policy  deci-
sions  that  are  being  made.  And  I  think  it  is  always  important, 
therefore, to distinguish between the best assessment scientists can 
offer of our current understanding of situations that bear on policy 
versus,  on  the  other  hand,  the  range  of  policy  preferences  which 
will  ultimately  enter  the  debate  based  on  the  diverse  kinds  of  fac-
tors that Dr. Lubchenco has mentioned. 

The  America  COMPETES  Act,  signed  into  law  in  August  2007, 
actually  requires  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Policy  to  develop  and  issue  an  overarching  set  of  principles 
to ensure the open communication of data and results from Federal 
scientists  and  to  prevent  the  intentional  or  unintentional  suppres-
sion  or  distortion  of  such  research  findings.  That  is  actually  a  big 
challenge  in  thinking  about  scientific  integrity  in  the  Federal  Gov-

ernment.  I  think  getting  it  done  is  going  to  require  clarifying  poli-
cies for disseminating research results, developing processes for ap-
pealing those dissemination decisions, and providing training to in-
form,  reinforce  and  update  managers,  researchers,  and  the  public 
information staffs on those policies. It is a big challenge, but we are 
going to get it right. 

The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Holdren, there are many scientists out there. 
Just  take  climate  change.  I  mean,  there  are  some  scientists—I 
mean, there are some sort of bogus papers put out and conclusions 
reached,  but  there  are  many  scientists  who  have  very,  very  dif-
ferent  views  about  what  the  irreversible  date  might  be,  for  exam-
ple,  on  climate  change;  or  how  serious  is  climate  change;  or  what 
do we have to do to measure its seriousness. And there are remark-
able differences from scientists on that subject. Yet they are all sci-
entists. How do you resolve that? 

Dr. HOLDREN. Well, let me say, first of all, that there has always 
been,  always  will  be  diversity  of  opinion  among  scientists  about 
any  complicated  issue.  Scientists  are  as  diverse  a  group  as  any 
other  you  will  find,  and  people  come  to  different  conclusions  about 
how to interpret the same data. This is routine. 

My  position  would  be  that  in  matters  of  public  policy,  policy-
makers should bet with the odds. You look at the range of scientific 
opinion. You look at the center of gravity of that scientific opinion. 
You look at what the bodies that have accumulated the most expert 
knowledge and brought it to bear on the question have to say. You 
can  never  conclude  that  any  particular  interpretation  in  science  is 
final.  All  science  is  contingent;  it  could  change  with  new  informa-
tion,  new  data,  new  observations,  new  analysis.  But  if  you  are 
making  policy,  it  is  wise  in  my  judgment  to  go  with  the  opinion  of 
the  bulk  of  the  part  of  the  scientific  community  that  has  studied 
that particular question. 

In  the  case  of  climate  change,  immense  effort  has  been  devoted 
to  determining  what  that  center  of  gravity  of  scientific  opinion  is. 
It  is  available  to  us  in  the  reports  of  the  National  Academy  of 
Sciences, in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, in the reports of distinguished bodies all around the world 
who  have  focused  the  relevant  expertise  available  to  them  on  this 
question.  And  the  basic  conclusions  of  all  of  those  groups  are  the 
same.  Climate  change  is  real.  It  is  accelerating.  It  is  caused,  in 
substantial  part,  by  human  activity.  It  is  dangerous  and  it  is  get-
ting more so. 

There  are  lots  of  details  on  which  you  can  find  lots  of  difference 
of  opinion,  but  the  mainstream  view  is  the  one  I  have  just  stated. 
And  if  I  were  a  policymaker  betting  the  public’s  welfare  on  an  in-
terpretation of science, I would go with the mainstream. 

The CHAIRMAN. All right. My time is up. Senator Hutchison, the 

Ranking Member. 

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
My  first  question  is  administrative  basically,  but  I  think  it  was 
said  by  Senator  Wyden—and  I  think  all  of  us  who  have  served  on 
this  committee  agree  that  we  have  been  bipartisan  and  we  have

been very strong for science and technology and research. My ques-
tion  to  both  of  you  is,  will  our  Committee,  every  member  of  our 
Committee, minority as well as majority, be able to call your offices 
for  help  within  your  agencies  with  data  that  we  might  need?  In 
other  words,  will  you  answer  questions  and  give  the  same  type  of 
help to every member of our Committee? 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Absolutely, Senator. 
Dr. HOLDREN. The same. I have always worked with members on 
both  sides  of  the  aisle  in  both  the  House  and  the  Senate.  I  do  not 
even  ask  my  potential  employees  what  their  political  affiliation  is. 
I look forward to working with all of you. 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you very much. 
Let me just say a couple of things that are very important to me 
in  the  experience  that  I  have  had  on  this  committee.  Number  one 
is  the  great  need  that  was  shown  in  the  report,  ‘‘Rising  Above  the 
Gathering Storm,’’ for more research into the basic sciences to stay 
on top of the fields of the hard sciences and, second, the encourage-
ment  of  teaching  and  recruiting  young  people  to  be  interested  in 
taking the courses in middle and high school so that they will take 
the courses in college, which I think you addressed somewhat. 

But  in  the  National  Science  Foundation,  for  instance,  the  social 
sciences have become I think a fairly large part, sometimes taking 
away  from  the  hard  sciences.  And  I  hope  that  we  can  know  where 
our  needs  are  and  our  priorities  right  now,  and  that  is  to  stay  on 
top  of  the  innovation  and  technological  advances  that  have  kept 
our  economy  strong  through  the  years.  So  that  is  one  area  that  I 
would like to discuss. 

Second,  my  colleague,  Senator  Nelson,  and  I  have  been  very  in-
terested in NASA and space, and the fact that we are going to have 
a  gap  of  5  or  6  years  when  Americans  will  not  be  able  to  fly  into 
space  is  not  acceptable  to  us.  And  I  would  like  to  ask  Dr.  Holdren 
if  you  are  committed  in  your  position  in  the  White  House  to  per-
haps  having  the  National  Space  Council  revived  where  there  is  a 
policy  focus  on  the  concerns  that  we  have  about  our  space  flight 
gap,  as  well  as  the  ability  to  use  the  Space  Station  for  basic  re-
search,  which  was  a  function  of  Senator  Nelson’s  and  my  author-
ization  of  NASA  that  we  did  designate  a  part  of  the  Space  Station 
as a national laboratory so that there could be more research influx 
from  outside  agencies,  which  has  begun  to  occur.  But  if  we  cannot 
get there, it is going to be hard to fulfill those missions. 

Dr.  Holdren,  will  you  make  NASA  and  science  in  space  a  pri-
ority,  and  do  you  have  any  thoughts  about  the  National  Space 
Council being a part of the White House to look at the overall focus 
of NASA? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  short  answer  to  the 
second  question  is  yes.  It  is  a  priority,  and  we  have  been  looking 
at  what  the  best  way  to  resurrect  the  National  Space  Council  in 
the White House would be. I think that is going to happen. 

And there is no question that the gap in our capacity to put peo-
ple in space is a matter of great concern with the Shuttle program 
coming to an end and its successor program not yet ready. We are 
looking at that very carefully, and I would look forward to working 
with  you  and  Senator  Nelson  and  the  other  members  of  this  com-
mittee  on  how  we  can  shrink  that  gap.  It  is  going  to  be  a  great

challenge, of course, particularly in these difficult budget times, but 
we  are  committed  to  figuring  that  problem  out  because  it  is  very 
important. 

On your first question about fundamental research, again I com-
pletely agree that we need to pay very careful attention to the ade-
quacy  of  our  support  for  fundamental  research  in  this  country. 
That  fundamental  research  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  Gov-
ernment  simply  because  when  you  are  talking  about  high-risk, 
high-pay-off,  long-term  kinds  of  investigations  where  the  imme-
diate  benefits  are  not  so  obvious,  nobody  but  the  Government  is 
going  to  invest  the  sums  of  money  needed  to  get  that  done.  And 
at  the  same  time,  it  is  relatively  cheap  compared  to  many  other 
things that we do. 

The America COMPETES Act, which really emerged in part from 
the  report  you  mentioned,  ‘‘Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,’’ 
embodied  the  recommendation  of  that  report  that  research  at  the 
NSF,  at  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  and 
in  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  should  be  ramped  up  at  a  rate  that 
would double it in 7 years. And that was authorized in the America 
COMPETES  Act.  I  think  it  is  a  good  idea.  I  think  we  will  pursue 
very  vigorously  every  way  at  our  disposal  to  try  to  see  that  that 
happens, although again it will be a huge challenge in the current 
budget environment. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Let  me  just  say—and  I  do  have  a  question 
for Dr. Lubchenco—that I would add NASA in there as well for the 
capabilities  to  use  the  Space  Station  and  other  areas  of  basic  sci-
entific  research  that  can  be  done  best  in  space,  as  you  are 
prioritizing. 

The other issue that I have—for the past two Congresses, I have 
introduced legislation to increase weather modification and mitiga-
tion  research.  My  original  bill  was  to  put  it  in  NOAA  because  I 
thought  that  would  be  the  better  place  for  it.  I  did  not  get  any-
where,  and  it  was  suggested  that  perhaps  we  should  put  it  in  the 
White  House  to  be  in  the  science  office,  the  OSTP.  And  it  died 
there as well. 

My question to you is—I really think it should be in NOAA with 
support  from  OSTP,  but  here  is  my  question.  You  talk  about  cli-
mate  change  research.  There  are  today  14  agencies  of  the  Federal 
Government  overlooking,  overseeing,  and  promoting  research  into 
climate change, which clearly means there is no focus and no strat-
egy  that  has  really  brought  us  into  what  I  think  is  a  cohesive  pol-
icy. 

But  mitigation  and  modification  has  really  not  come  to  the  fore-
front, and with the violence in weather that we see, which has cer-
tainly hit my State, has hit Senator Martinez and Senator Nelson’s 
State  very  hard—we  just  saw  it  in  Oklahoma  last  week—I  believe 
it  is  time  for  us  to  step  back  and  say  is  there  something  that  we 
are  doing  that  is  making  a  difference  in  this  violence  of  weather 
or  is  there  something  we  could  do  that  would  affect  it,  either  pro 
or con. 

For instance, is there something that could be done to lessen the 
impact  of  a  hurricane  when  it  is  still  out  in  the  far  miles  of  the 
ocean away from land, or is there something that could be done in 
tornadoes,  or  is  there  something  that  is  happening  when  we  actu-

44 

ally  do  weather  modification  in  cloud  seeding  in  one  area  that 
makes an avalanche occur in another area? 

I  do  not  know  the  answers,  and  I  do  not  know  if  it  is  positive 
or  negative.  But  it  seems  to  me  that  if  we  are  going  to  look  at  cli-
mate change, weather mitigation and/or modification should also be 
something  that  we  try  to  do  research  on  to  determine  if  there  is 
something  that  can  be  done  or  if  something  is  done  in  one  place, 
would it affect another place. 

And  I  would  ask  both  of  you  to  address  if  you  think  this  is  wor-
thy, where you think it would most likely reside, and would either 
of  you  be  willing  to  help  work  on  something  that  would  move  this 
priority up in the climate change arena as well. 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Let  me  take  a  first  crack  at  that,  and  then  I  will 

turn it over to my colleague. 

People have for years been studying the possibilities for weather 
modification,  not  just  rain  enhancement,  but  trying  to  ameliorate 
the power of the most powerful storms. It is an immense challenge 
because the power of nature manifested in these ways is enormous 
and  it  is  difficult  to  influence  or  steer  it.  But  I  believe  that  such 
work  needs  to  continue.  It  would  need  to  continue  even  if  we  did 
not  have  reason  to  be  concerned  about  human  influences  on  large 
and powerful storms because even before human influences, we all 
know those storms can do tremendous damage. 

So  I  think  it  is  a  worthy  area  of  further  research.  I  think  it 
should be expanded, along with many other things that need to be 
expanded in our study of weather and climate. 

You  mentioned  14  agencies.  We  have  in  the  Global  Change  Re-
search  Program,  authorized  in  the  Global  Change  Research  Act  of 
1990,  a  framework  for  integrating  the  efforts  in  those  14  agencies 
and  to  making  sure  that  important  issues  do  not  fall  between  the 
chairs and that, at the same time, unnecessary duplication is elimi-
nated. I think that Act is in need of updating and expansion by the 
Congress,  and  there  have  been  bills  in  both  the  Senate  and  the 
House  that  contain  a  lot  of  the  needed  ingredients,  and  I  would 
very  much  want  to  work  with  this  committee  and  others  to  make 
sure that that gets done. 

I  think  that  the  weather  modification  issue  that  you  are  inter-
ested  in  would  be  something  that  could  well  be  pursued  in  NOAA. 
There may be other agencies that are interested in it. From OSTP’s 
standpoint,  I  would  certainly  want  to  be  involved  in  the  coordina-
tion  that  makes  sure  that  the  important  research  that  needs  to  be 
done gets done in the place best suited to do it. 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Senator, part of your question alluded to the im-
portance of weather forecasting, and I would note that fully a third 
of the U.S. GDP is dependent on accurate weather forecasting and 
that our ability to do that is, in fact, the product of lots of research 
in the past and ongoing research to make it even better and better. 
I  agree  with  you  completely  that  it  is  appropriate  to  go  beyond 
simple  forecasting  and  to  do  the  fundamental  research  that  is  ap-
propriate  to  help  us  understand  if  it  is  possible  and,  if  so,  how  to 
modify  the  impact  of  some  of  these  weather-related  disasters  but 
also  to  guide  our  understanding  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  ef-
forts.  I  am  a  strong  believer  in  the  importance  of  fundamental  re-
search  to  help  do  the  kinds  of  things  that  are  needed  by  society.

As  to  where  it  best  fits,  I  cannot  give  you  that  answer  now,  but 
I  would  be  willing  to  work  with  you,  if  I  am  confirmed,  and  with 
my colleague, Dr. Holdren, and try to figure this out.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHNNY ISAKSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA 

Senator ISAKSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I have to say of all the nominees by the President for his Cabinet 
or  for  White  House  appointments  that  I  have  interviewed,  Dr. 
Lubchenco is the most engaging and qualified. And I had a delight-
ful meeting with her, and I have absolutely no questions of her be-
cause with all the ones I asked her yesterday she was spot-on. 

But Dr. Holdren, who I am sorry I did not get the chance to meet 
with, in your opening statement made a statement that hits at the 
heart of the discussion we had yesterday, Dr. Lubchenco. 

In  fact,  Dr.  Lubchenco  and  I  are  going  to  do  a  scuba  diving  trip 

in the spring. We both share that affinity, among other things. 

Dr.  Holdren,  when  you  were  talking  about  the  two  strands  that 
dictate  policy  and  science  and  technology,  you  said  the  following: 
‘‘meaning  the  use  of  insights  from  science  and  engineering  in  the 
formation  of  those  parts  of  economic,  defense,  space,  health,  envi-
ronmental  policy,  agricultural  policy,  and  so  on,  where  such  in-
sights are needed to help shape sensible policies.’’ 

My  question  yesterday  of  Dr.  Lubchenco  was:  in  the  Savannah 
River  basin  between  Georgia  and  South  Carolina,  we  are  in  a  cat-
egory  4  drought,  as  are  we  in  the  ACT  and  the  ACF.  In  the  ACT 
and  the  ACF,  there  is  litigation  that  is  dictating  water  flows,  but 
in the Savannah River basin, it is being done by the Corps of Engi-
neers outside of litigation. 

Recently  the  cfs  flow  was  increased  by  500  cfs  out  of  Lakes 
Hardwell and Thurmond into the Savannah River in order to raise 
the level so as to protect a sturgeon. And this is not an endangered 
species  suit.  NOAA  was  asked  to  opine  as  to  what  the  release 
should  be  and  they  did,  and  in  reading  it,  it  appeared  to  fit  more 
of an insight than evidence. 

So  my  question  to  you  is  this.  Given  that  water  is  so  essential 
to  the  life  of  human  beings  and  so  essential  to  our  well-being  and 
given  that  there  are  many  policies  agriculturally,  environmentally, 
and otherwise, where NOAA or scientists are asked to opine to de-
termine  what  those  releases  are,  should  that  not  be  best  based  on 
scientific evidence rather than insight? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  I  guess  that  is  a  question  to  me  or  to  both  of  us? 
Senator  ISAKSON.  It  is  kind  of  a  speech.  I  am  sorry  about  that. 
But  it  is  really  important  because  we  are  so  concerned  that  opin-
ions  overtake  facts,  and  the  next  thing  you  know  you  are  making 
decisions  based  on  an  insight  but  not  really  sound  scientific  evi-
dence. 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Well,  again  I  would  say  the  short  answer  is  yes. 
We,  of  course,  would  want  to  base  policies  where  science  is  ger-

mane  on  the  best  scientific  understanding  that  can  be  brought  to 
bear,  and  in  circumstances  where  that  does  not  happen  because  of 
lack of coordination among different agencies, because perhaps one 
has  gotten  advice  from  a  place  that  did  not  have  the  best  current 
understanding,  we  need  to  work  on  fixing  that.  But  there  is  no 
question,  I  think,  that  everybody  who  pays  attention  to  the  inter-
section  of  science  and  public  policy  wants  that  communication  be-
tween  science  and  policy  to  be  communicating  the  best  under-
standings that we have. 

Senator  ISAKSON.  Well,  I  appreciate  that  answer,  which  is  very 
much similar to the answer that Dr. Lubchenco gave me yesterday. 
And  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  with  NOAA  when  we 
deal with these issues that affect my State or really our region, be-
cause  most  all  these  are  interstate  issues  not  intrastate  issues,  to 
make  sure  we  are  always  getting  the  best  scientific  evidence  we 
can to dictate the right policy that affects the people we represent. 
But  I  wish  you  the  best  and  I  look  forward  to  our  scuba  diving 

trip, Dr. Lubchenco. 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator ISAKSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Isakson. 
Senator Nelson? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator  NELSON.  Picking  up  on  the  Ranking  Member’s  ques-
tions—and by the way, Mr. Chairman, I am really excited to be the 
chairman of the Science and Space Subcommittee. I am going to try 
to do you a good job. 

I  am  really  very  excited  about  the  quality  of  nominees  that  we 

have in front of us, and I am very heartened by their answers. 

Now,  just  following  up  on  Senator  Hutchison’s  comments  about 
changing weather, we might not be able to change weather, but we 
can sure try to track weather and more accurately measure it. 

Dr.  Lubchenco,  you  and  I  have  talked  about  the  need  for  en-
hanced cooperation between NASA and NOAA, the earth-observing 
satellites,  NPOES  and  GOES–R.  And  that  is  a  big  order  because 
those two agencies have not necessarily cooperated in the past. Do 
you want to comment for the record on that? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  believe  that  both  NOAA  and  NASA 
intend  to  have  the  best  possible  relationships.  I  think  we  can  al-
ways  improve  on  relationships.  As  you  are  aware,  there  is  a  third 
entity  involved  in  these  satellites,  and  that  is  the  Department  of 
Defense. It is my opinion that some of the difficulties that we have 
gotten  into,  in  terms  of  the  two  satellite  programs  you  mentioned, 
are  partly  a  reflection  of  the  tripartite  arrangement  among  those 
three  agencies  that  has  not  worked  to  the  extent  that  it  needs  to. 
I think that is an embarrassment. I think it needs to be fixed, and 
one  of  my  highest  priorities  is  to  work  with  my  colleagues,  if  I  am 
confirmed,  in  those  agencies,  and  with  the  Office  of  Science  and 
Technology  Policy,  and  with  you  to  fix  this  problem  and  put  it  be-
hind us.

Senator  NELSON.  I  have  the  privilege  of  chairing  that  Sub-
committee  in  the  Armed  Services  Committee  as  well,  and  I  want 
to work with you on that to see if we can smooth this out. 

Now,  Dr.  Holdren,  I  was  really  very  heartened  to  hear  your  re-
sponse  to  Senator  Hutchison  about  the  National  Space  Council. 
Just  for  the  record,  I  want  it  established  that  then-candidate 
Obama  clearly  came  out  and  stated  that  he  wanted  to  reactivate 
the  National  Space  Council  within  the  White  House.  Do  you  want 
to say any more for the record here about that in addition to what 
you have said to Senator Hutchison? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Well,  I  am  certainly  happy  to  reiterate  that  the 
President  remains  committed  to  that  pledge.  And  as  I  mentioned 
before, we are in discussion about the best way to do it, but I have 
no doubt that it is going to happen. 

Senator  NELSON.  Well,  that  is  great  because  one  of  the  failings 
in the past—and not just with this immediate past Administration, 
but  previous  ones—is  that  NASA  becomes  the  handmaiden  of  the 
Office  of  Management  and  Budget.  And  that  is  not  the  way  to  set 
policy  by  having  some  green  eyeshade  person  over  there  deter-
mining  what  the  policy  is,  whether  we  are  talking  about  NASA  or 
NOAA or whatever it is. But that is the way it has been in the past 
and, therefore, another reason at the high councils of high Govern-
ment  policymaking  to  have  such  a  council  right  within  the  White 
House. 

You  are  going  to  have  four  associate  directors.  Do  you  want  to 

tell us quickly what those are going to be? 

Dr. HOLDREN. Certainly, Senator. The four will be the same four 
Senate-confirmed  associate  director  positions  that  existed  in  the 
Clinton  administration.  There  will  be  an  associate  director  for 
science,  an  associate  director  for  technology,  an  associate  director 
for environment, and an associate director for national security and 
international affairs. 

Senator  NELSON.  And  how  are  you  going  to  coordinate  with  oth-
ers that get into energy and climate change policies, such as Carol 
Browner,  Dr.  Chu,  Nancy  Sutley,  as  well  as  the  NOAA  Adminis-
trator? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  The  first  thing  I  would  say  about  that  is  that  the 
job of OSTP has always been about coordination. All of these issues 
are issues that get pursued in multiple agencies inside and outside 
the  White  House  and  are  dealt  with  by  multiple  Congressional 
committees.  So  I  regard  one  of  the  primary  challenges  and  one  of 
the primary functions of OSTP to be building the relationships that 
enable  those  interactions  to  work  in  a  collaborative  and  efficient 
way.  I  think  the  people  who  have  been  named  to  the  other  posi-
tions  you  have  mentioned  in  the  energy  domain  are  people  of  very 
high caliber. They are also people that I happen to have known and 
worked  with  for  a  long  time.  I  have  known  and  worked  with  Dr. 
Lubchenco  for  a  long  time.  And  I  think  as  a  result,  in  part,  of  the 
long-standing  collegial  relationships  which  we  have  in  this  set  of 
people, we are actually going to be able to work this very well. 

Senator  NELSON.  By  the  way,  Dr.  Lubchenco,  also  in  accurately 
measuring  the  weather:  that  also  directly  affects  NOAA  in  having 
the  assets  that  it  needs  in  space  to  measure  the  weather  and  pre-
venting  a  potential  problem  of  the  increased  accuracy.  This  is  a

problem  that  we  now  have  on  the  paths  of  hurricanes  on  that  sin-
gle-point failure: if the G–4 airplane is down for maintenance or be-
cause of an accident, there is an issue of having some backup there. 
I  want  to  ask  you.  You  said  at  the  end  of  your  statement,  Dr. 
Lubchenco,  that  you  want  to  create  a  National  Climate  Service 
within NOAA. How is that organization going to interact and affect 
NASA’s earth science programs? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  the  vision  for  the  National  Climate 
Service would be a collaboration across a number of relevant agen-
cies. NOAA currently has a wealth of climate data. It has deep ex-
perience  in  assembling  those  data  and  putting  them  into  models 
that help us understand how the climate system works. And we are 
at  a  point  now  where  we  are  able  to  do  short-term  forecasting  of 
climate-related  events  like  El  Nin˜ os,  for  example,  that  have  huge 
consequences  for  weather  patterns  around  the  world.  The  concept 
is  to  build  on  the  very  successful  model  of  the  National  Weather 
Service and to do the same for climate services, but it clearly is an 
operation that would interact, in a very collaborative, collegial fash-
ion, with a number of other agencies that have information or need 
of those kinds of data. 

Senator NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Nelson. 
Senator Martinez? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MEL MARTINEZ, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator MARTINEZ. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and let 
me  tell  you  it  is  a  real  pleasure  to  join  the  Committee  and  I  look 
forward  to  working  with  you  and  the  other  members  of  the  Com-
mittee  on  issues  that  are  vitally  important  to  our  Nation  and  the 
world. 

The CHAIRMAN. We are glad you are here. 
Senator MARTINEZ. Thank you. 
I  wanted  to  offer  to  Dr.  Lubchenco  and  Senator  Isakson  the  op-
portunity  to  do  their  scuba  diving  trip  in  the  Florida  Keys  where 
I  think  you  will  find  an  incredible  natural  resource  in  our  marine 
sanctuary, as well as at the Dry Tortugas where the NOAA people 
do  a  fantastic  job  of  keeping  an  eye  on  that  valuable  resource  as 
well.  So  anyway,  come  down  to  Florida.  I  will  be  glad  to  host  you. 
I am sure Senator Nelson would join me in that. 

For the last two Congresses, I have been working with others in 
trying  to  advance  legislation  that  would  promote  a  national  hurri-
cane  research  initiative  to  improve  the  understanding  of  hurri-
canes, as well as the forecasting and preparedness. This came from 
a  recommendation,  a  report  by  the  National  Science  Board,  which 
I  would  commend  to  your  reading.  It  would  marshal  the  resources 
of  various  Government  agencies  and  research  universities  and  pri-
vate  sector  partners  to  improve  knowledge  of  hurricane  intensity, 
storm surges, and observation. 

The  whole  concept  is  that  if  we  know  better  not  only  that  it  is 
coming  next  Tuesday  but  how  strong  it  is  going  to  be  or  what  the 
surge  with  it  is  going  to  be,  because  oftentimes  we  find  that  much 
of the damage, as we know in my colleague, Senator Vitter’s State

in  New  Orleans,  is  the  sea  surge  that  sometimes  does  the  greater 
damage, not the wind damage. 

Would you commit to improving, Dr. Lubchenco, our ability to do 
the research and perhaps to encourage this type of legislation that 
would  give  you  the  ability  to  do  better  forecasting  on  hurricanes? 
Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  first  of  all,  thank  you  for  mentioning 
the wonderful work that NOAA scientists and employees have been 
doing in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and the Dry 
Tortugas,  in  particular.  It  is  a  remarkable  accomplishment.  And  a 
real  credit  to  everyone  who  has  been  involved.  So  thank  you  for 
recognizing  their  hard  work  and  their  wonderful  accomplishments. 
I think that we have seen the benefits of research into hurricane 
forecasting,  and  I  note  the  remarkable  improvements  that  have 
been  accomplished  over  the  last  couple  of  decades  in  terms  of  our 
ability  to  predict  hurricanes  and  thereby  save  many  thousands  of 
lives,  as  well  as  avoided  evacuations.  We  have  seen  the  power  of 
investment  in  fundamental  research  that  has  brought  about  those 
increases.  I  believe  there  is  more  benefit  to  come  from  that,  and  I 
would agree with you wholeheartedly that additional research into 
improved  forecasting,  not  just  for  the  path  of  hurricanes,  but  for 
storm surge and the other consequences that can be very damaging 
would be a smart investment. 

Senator  MARTINEZ.  We  need  to  work  on  mitigation  efforts  as  it 
relates  to  hurricanes  because  I  think  the  damage  could  be  greatly 
reduced if we do the right preparation. 

And  while  passing  accolades,  I  think  the  National  Hurricane 
Center  in  Miami,  by  the  way—those  folks  do  a  tremendous  job. 
They are very dedicated people. There are certain times of the year 
when  those  of  us  who  live  in  vulnerable  areas  like  Florida  stay 
pretty much glued to what they have to say. So it is very, very im-
portant work as well. 

We  have  had  some  issues  in  Florida  relating  to  fishing  quotas, 
and  it  is  an  area  where  sometimes  a  lot  of  controversy  arises  be-
cause sometimes the research does not match up with what the ex-
perience  seems  to  be  on  the  field,  if  you  will.  It  is  an  area  where 
I  hope  perhaps  you  will  attempt  to  put  some  common  sense  into 
the science to ensure that we are doing what is really best. 

We  want  to  protect  our  fisheries.  We  want  to  protect  the  re-
sources.  We  want  to  protect  the  different  species,  but  at  the  same 
time,  a  lot  of  people  depend  on  fishing  for  a  livelihood  whether  it 
is  related  to  commercial  fishing  or  simply  tourism  and  enjoyment. 
And we have run into some conflict there over the recent days, and 
I wanted to highlight that to you and commend it for some analysis 
and study on your part. 

I  do  not  know  that  I  want  to  take  sides  on  that  because  I  am 
not  a  scientist,  and  I  know  I  want  the  resources  there  for  my 
grandchildren, but I also want to make sure that when I hear com-
plaints that sometimes seem to be based on common sense that we 
are  not  putting  the  practical  aspects  of  this  ahead  of  what  might 
be  on  a  scientific  notional  basis  wrong.  So  I  am  not  so  sure  that 
is a question, more of a comment. 

With respect to the National Climate Service, having been in the 
Executive Branch, there is a certain reality, and I do not know how 
one  frees  themselves  from  the  clutches  of  OMB.  If  you  can  pull  it

off  in  this  Administration,  you  have  my  congratulations.  I  never 
could  manage  that  at  HUD  during  the  time  that  I  was  there,  but 
I wish you well in that to both of you. 

But the reality is that when you look at initiating something like 
a national climate service, what is going to suffer or what is going 
to  be—in  other  words,  how  do  we  make  that  work?  I  can  under-
stand  that,  but  I  do  not  want  it  to  be  at  the  expense  of  the  other 
work  that  is  so  very  important  that  we  are  doing  with  weather 
today.  So  can  you  maybe  comment  on  that  and  how  you  intend  to 
approach it? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  have  not  yet  had  an  opportunity  to 
dig deeply into all of the thinking that has been done about the Na-
tional Climate Service. I think that it is a very compelling concept. 
The  information  that  I  have  seen  is,  I  think,  suggestive  that  there 
is  real  opportunity  here.  What  the  trade-offs  would  be  and  exactly 
how  it  would  organized  is  yet  to  be  defined.  I  would  look  forward 
to  working  with  the  other  relevant  agencies  and  with  this  com-
mittee in helping to outline what that looks like. 

Senator  MARTINEZ.  And  Dr.  Holdren,  in  the  moment  I  have  re-
maining,  I  just  wanted  to  tell  you  that  I  worked  with  a  number  of 
other colleagues here on the America COMPETES Act, and I think 
it is a terribly important initiative. I hope that you will give it the 
necessary  passion  and  interest.  I  believe  that  our  competitiveness 
vis-a`-vis  the  world  is  one  of  our  real  upcoming  challenges  which 
goes  beyond  climate  and  other  issues,  but  it  really  has  to  do  with 
human capital. 

I  have  been  involved  also  on  the  issues  relating  to  immigration, 
and  I  think  as  we  look  forward  to  some  sort  of  sensible  immigra-
tion  policy  for  the  future  of  this  country,  that  we  also  should  look 
to  human  capital  and  how  we  can  utilize  the  immigration  laws— 
sensible  immigration  reform  that  our  country  so  desperately 
needs—to ensure that we are not just utilizing it as a means of pro-
moting family reunification, but we also view it as a way of improv-
ing  our  competitiveness  in  the  world  and  as  a  natural  resource  in 
terms of human capital. 

Dr. HOLDREN. Well, I agree with all of that, Senator, and I would 
certainly,  if  confirmed  by  the  Senate,  be  giving  a  lot  of  attention 
to  making  sure  that  the  America  COMPETES  Act  is  appropriately 
pursued across the many agencies that it affects. 

Senator MARTINEZ. Thank you very much, both of you, and thank 

you for serving and thank you to your families. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Martinez. 
Senator Begich? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK BEGICH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  BEGICH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you  for 
allowing  me  to  shift  up  here.  I  appreciate  it.  I  do  not  know  if,  be-
cause I had no microphones there, there was a purpose.

Senator  BEGICH.  After  8  weeks,  they  have  figured  it  out  that 
they  do  not  want  me  to  say  too  much.  But  no,  Mr.  Chairman,

And we have two very good nominees here, based on the informa-
tion  I  have  read.  I  have  some  very  parochial  questions.  Of  course, 
from  Alaska,  we  would.  And  then  I  have  some  general  questions 
based on your testimony, which I want to follow up. 

Dr.  Lubchenco,  we  had  a  great  conversation.  I  think  it  was  yes-
terday. I have lost track of time here. No day is the same anymore 
here.  But  I  want  to  get  specific  on  a  couple  things,  and  a  couple 
of the issues are, again, very parochial. 

But  in  regards  to  fish  farming,  Alaska  has  banned  fish  farming. 
We  now  produce—about  62  percent  of  the  landed  seafood  stock  in 
this country comes from Alaska. And I think we have probably the 
best managed fisheries in this country just by the way we do it and 
it  is  solely—or  I  should  say,  probably  95  percent  based  on  science. 
Sometimes  other  issues  get  connected  to  it,  and  I  think  that  is 
what  has  made  us  successful  in  how  we  have  managed  the  efforts 
of Alaska’s seafood that feeds this world in a lot of ways. 

Can  you  give  me  your  thoughts  and  opinions  in  regards  to  sup-
port or, I would hope the next statement would be the more logical 
one, no support of aquaculture in Federal waters? Farming. 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  understand  that  there  are  very  real 
and  legitimate  questions  that  have  been  raised  about  offshore 
aquaculture.  It  is  my  view  that  aquaculture,  wherever  it  is  prac-
ticed, is a very key element of our food production systems and that 
certain  types  of  aquaculture  are  much  more  benign  in  terms  of 
their  potential  impact  on  the  environment.  I  believe  that  there 
needs  to  be  scientifically  grounded  information  about  how  to 
achieve  aquaculture  that  is  sustainable,  in  other  words,  without 
adversely impacting the local or regional environment and without 
having negative consequences on wild-caught fisheries. 

I  do  not  believe  that  we  have  identified  the  right  conditions 
under  which  aquaculture  is  sustainable.  I  would  make  that  a  pri-
ority  if  I  were  confirmed.  Those  statements  pertain  to  aquaculture 
in  general,  and  as  you  are  well  aware,  there  are  more  than  220 
species  that  are  farmed  by  aquaculture  and  each  one  has  different 
issues and where it happens is critically important. 

So  I  am  not  prepared  to  put  offshore  aquaculture  off  the  table 
at  this  point.  I  do  believe  that  we  should  not  move  ahead  in  doing 
that  at  scale  until  we  are  convinced  that,  in  fact,  it  can  be  done 
in a way that is not damaging. 

Senator  BEGICH.  Let  me  do  additional  follow  up  to  that  with  re-
spect to specifically Alaska, where the Alaska community has made 
a  position  to  ban  it.  With  waters  off  the  shores  of  Alaska,  with  re-
spect and understanding to where Alaska is and the communities— 
and there is no question in my mind we have the most sustainable 
fisheries  in  this  country.  So  how  would  you  look  at  Alaska  and 
their aspects of what they have done in making that determination 
or that decision? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  have  great  respect  for  the  positions 
that Alaska has taken on this issue, and I believe that this is actu-
ally  an  opportunity  to  have  a  productive  Federal-State  dialogue 
about practices in either State waters that affect Federal waters or 
Federal  waters  that  affect  State  waters  and  to  come  to  an  agree-
ment  about  what  actually  is  going  to  work  for  all  of  the  species 
that,  in  fact,  go  back  and  forth  across  State  and  Federal  waters.

We  need  to  think  about  this  more  holistically  and  this  is  a  prime 
opportunity to do that. 

Senator BEGICH. Excellent. 
One  other  question.  I  think  in  the  past  you  have  been  on  record 
at least with previous administrations utilizing the Antiquities Act 
to  close  large  areas  in  the  Pacific  area.  And  it  is  not  required  that 
there be a NEPA or that even stakeholders are part of the process. 
How  do  you  see  your  role  here  now?  Because  when  you  are  on 
this side of the equation, it is a little different. And how do you see 
ensuring  that  there  is  a  process  clearly  with  stakeholders  and  a 
NEPA-like  or  a  NEPA  process  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  good  sci-
entific evidence that is on the table? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Thank  you  for  that  question,  Senator.  I  have 
seen firsthand scientific information that suggests that marine pro-
tected  areas  and  no-take  marine  reserves  can,  in  fact,  bring  huge 
benefit  both  in  terms  of  protecting  natural  resources  and  in  some 
cases in helping to restore depleted fisheries. 

More  to  the  point,  though,  is  the  process  by  which  decisions  are 
made  to  utilize  this  particular  tool.  It  is  my  belief  that  the  best 
processes  and  ones  for  which  decisions  will  be  respected  and  en-
dure  are  processes  that  involve  strong  stakeholder  input,  public 
participation,  and  open  and  transparent  decisionmaking,  much  as 
what  is  embodied  in  the  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Act.  So  my 
commitment,  should  I  be  confirmed  as  Administrator  of  NOAA, 
would  be  to  ensure  that  we  do  have  an  adequate  public  process 
that is open and transparent. 

Senator BEGICH. Thank you very much, Doctor. 
I  have  just  a  couple  seconds.  Dr.  Holdren,  I  did  not  want  to  feel 
like  you  were  left  out.  So  I  am  going  to  give  you  some  questions 
in  writing.  I  do  not  know  if  there  will  be  a  second  round  or  not, 
but I will do that. 

you. 

The CHAIRMAN. There will be a second round. 
Senator  BEGICH.  Then  I  will  hold  my  question  for  you.  Thank 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  should  announce,  incidentally,  before  I  call  on 
Senator  Snowe,  that  both  Senator  Hutchison  and  I  read  the  FBI 
checks on these two distinguished folks, and it is some of the easi-
est reading I have ever been through.

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator  SNOWE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  want  to  wel-
come our two distinguished witnesses, both of whom are steeped in 
peer-based,  sound  science  which  we  certainly  welcome  because  so 
much of the credible science is going to dictate some crucial policies 
in  your  respective  fields  and  jointly  when  it  comes  to  climate 
change. So the expertise and experience and background and quali-
fications  that  you  both  bring  to  that  endeavor  is  certainly  going  to 
be  helpful  to  those  of  us  as  policymakers  and  especially  in  some 
very contentious debates. 

Dr.  Holdren,  I  have  worked  with  you  on  the  International  Panel 
on Climate Change, which I co-chaired with the Honorable Stephen

Byers,  a  member  of  Parliament  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  you 
contributed  so  much  and  worked  so  hard  on  the  10  recommenda-
tions  that  were  provided  back  in  2005  that  actually  are  more  rel-
evant than ever at a time when we are trying to establish, I think, 
some  advisory  guidelines  for  the  developed  and  the  developing 
countries,  especially  those  countries  like  the  United  States  and 
China and India outside the Kyoto Protocol. 

Obviously,  in  considering  the  debate  on  climate  change  and  de-
termining  what  is  going  to  be  our  policy,  what  is  going  to  dictate 
the level of emissions reductions in climate change legislation that 
will  be  debated  before  the  Congress  obviously  is  to  avert  the  tip-
ping  point  of  raising  the  earth’s  temperature.  And  we  are  about 
what?  350  parts  per  million  at  this  point.  What  are  you  going  to 
be advising the President in this regard? Because, obviously, it can 
make a difference by 2050 whether we are reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions by 50 percent, 65 percent, 70 or 80 percent. 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Well,  thank  you,  Senator.  We  are  at  about  385 
parts per million of carbon dioxide today in the atmosphere. There 
is, as you know, a complicated relationship between what the emis-
sions are and what the concentrations ultimately become. 

The  President  has  taken  the  position—took  the  position  very 
strongly in the campaign—that the United States should be aiming 
to reduce its emissions by something like 80 percent by 2050. That 
would be compatible with a global strategy that would have a rea-
sonable chance of confining the global average surface temperature 
increase to about 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. And 
that, in turn, I think would give us a reasonable chance of avoiding 
some of the worst possible outcomes from climate change. I believe 
the President remains committed to that goal. 

Obviously,  it  will  be  a  great  challenge  to  get  there,  but  I  will 
point  out  that  there  will  also  be  tremendous  opportunities  associ-
ated with getting there in terms of the kinds of innovation in clean 
energy and increased energy efficiency that will create jobs and en-
able this country to maintain and improve its competitive position. 
The  issue,  of  course,  as  you  have  mentioned,  does  involve  other 
countries as well. It is not possible for the United States to address 
this  question  by  itself.  We  will  need  to  bring  China  and  India  and 
the other major developing countries, as well as the other industri-
alized  countries,  along  in  this  process  of  reducing  emissions.  I  am 
actually  quite  optimistic  about  that,  and  I  know  the  President  is, 
in  part  because  the  major  developing  country  emitters  like  China 
and  India  have  recognized  that  climate  change  is  already  harming 
them and it cannot be fixed without them. So I think we are going 
to see a process of engagement with those big emitters in the devel-
oping world, as well as with our industrial country partners. 

Senator SNOWE. So you do not see any need at this point to make 

any adjustments on that recommendation. 

Dr. HOLDREN. The whole question of exactly how to construct our 
intersecting energy and climate policies going forward is, obviously, 
going to be a question intensely discussed and interacted about be-
tween  the  Administration  and  the  Congress.  You  know,  I  think  at 
this  point  the  President  has  laid  out  his  general  aims,  and  he  will 
be interested in pursuing those.

But  there  is  no  question  that  this  is  a  complicated  domain  in 
which there is going to be a lot of discussion. A lot of different pro-
visions,  a  lot  of  different  approaches  will  be  discussed.  The  Con-
gress is clearly going to have a tremendous role to play in this, and 
of course, we are looking forward to your leadership, among others, 
because  you  have  been  a  leader  in  this  domain  in  the  Senate  and 
in the world. 

But it is going be a long slog. I do not want to kid anybody. This 
is going to be tough to fashion the policies that will get us and the 
rest  of  the  world  to  where  we  should  want  to  be  in  order  to  mini-
mize  the  risks  of  climate  change  of  a  magnitude  that  we  would 
have difficulty dealing with. 

Senator SNOWE. I appreciate that. 
Dr. Lubchenco, we talked in our office the other day on a number 
of issues and most notably as well on the fisheries. And I expressed 
to  you  at  the  time  my  deep  concern  about  the  tremendous  divide 
and  polarization  that  exists  between  our  fishing  communities  and 
the  men  and  women  in  the  fishing  industry  in  New  England  and 
certainly  in  the  State  of  Maine  and  the  administrators  and  regu-
lators.  I  have  never  seen  it  more  polarized  in  my  13  years  that  I 
have  served  in  a  leadership  capacity  on  the  Subcommittee  on 
Oceans and Fisheries, both as Chair and as Ranking Member. 

And  most  recently  with  the  groundfish  industry  and  the  interim 
rule  that  was  just  recently  announced  that  essentially  reduces  the 
days at sea by 60 percent to 20 days, that is about 3 weeks to make 
a  living  in  the  groundfishing  industry.  It  is  devastating,  obviously, 
as  I  have  indicated  to  you,  particularly  because  the  New  England 
Fisheries  Council  in  a  15  to  1  decision  favored  an  alternative,  and 
it  totally  dismissed  the  decisions  made  by  all  15,  and  the  1  was, 
of  course,  the  Regional  Administrator  who  dismissed  the  rec-
ommendation. So here we are with 20 days at sea. 

What  bold  steps  will  you  take  to  repair  this  relationship?  Be-
cause it clearly needs to be repaired. There is a lack of trust, right-
fully so, given the arbitrariness of the regulatory process and regu-
lators  that  have  totally  ignored  and  dismissed  and  overridden  the 
concerns  of  the  fishing  community.  They  are  going  to  be  dev-
astated. We need to preserve the fish and the fishing stock and we 
also need to preserve the communities. 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Senator, I believe it is time to create a new cli-
mate of trust—to have trust in the data, to have trust in the proc-
ess,  and  to  have  trust  in  the  diverse  points  of  view.  I  agree  with 
you  completely  that  the  polarization  has  really  permeated  and 
poisoned all of the discussions. It appears to be a seriously dysfunc-
tional relationship. 

I  would  pledge  to  make  every  attempt  to  try  to  begin  to  rebuild 
the  trust.  I  have  seen  a  number  of  programs  where  scientists  and 
fishermen  together  are  taking  the  data  that  they  can  both  believe 
in  and  both  rely  upon  to  serve  as  a  basis  for  having  a  reasonable 
discussion  about  making  what  are  inevitably  some  very  tough 
choices.  There  are  not  easy  choices  here.  And  it  is  often  a  choice 
between today and tomorrow. 

We  have  seen  the  strong  benefit  of  rebuilding  stocks.  The  12 
stocks  that  have  been  rebuilt  since  2001  now  bring  in  over  $2  bil-

lion into our economy. Yet jobs today are critically important, even 
more so than they might have been even just a few years ago. 

So  there  are,  indeed,  difficult  decisions  and  difficult  choices. 
Those  choices  will  be  no  less  difficult  but  more  acceptable  if  there 
is  a  better  climate  of  trust,  and  I  would  pledge  to  work  with  you 
to try to begin to build that and change the tenor of the discussion 
and the responses to the decisions. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  very  much  appreciate  that,  and  I  thank  you 

both. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Snowe. 
Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  and 
I look forward to working hard on the issues before this committee 
facing  this  Congress.  I  want  to  thank  you  for  your  leadership.  I 
know  there  is  a  lot  to  do  from  the  reauthorization  of  the  FAA  to 
the  digital  TV  transition,  to  helping  our  captive  shippers,  some-
thing  that  I  know  you  care  a  lot  about.  And  I  am  very  much  look-
ing forward to it. 

I  want  to  thank  you  also  for  the  Subcommittee  Chairmanship.  I 
look forward to chairing the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, In-
novation, and Export Promotion. We are going to have a busy agen-
da. 

And  I  also  welcome  our  two  nominees  here.  I  note,  Dr. 
Lubchenco, that everyone keeps inviting you to go scuba diving off 
the  coast  of  Florida  and  other  places.  I  could  only  invite  you  to  go 
scuba diving in Lake Superior, which would be slightly chilly. 

In fact, you may have heard I, for 2 years, served on the Oceans 
Subcommittee being the only non-ocean Senator on there, but Lake 
Superior  is  very  important,  and  the  Great  Lakes,  to  that  Sub-
committee as well. And the economic and environmental challenges 
to  our  Great  Lakes  continue  to  mount  on  a  daily  basis,  from  the 
depletion  of  commercial  fishing,  something  Senator  Snowe  men-
tioned off the coast of Maine, to health concerns posed by contami-
nated seafood, to the local effects of global climate change. 

We  have  issues  with  Lake  Superior.  We  have  had  some  decreas-
ing  water  levels  that  many  believe  may  be  due  to  climate  change. 
They got up slightly last year, but overall they have been at an all- 
time low and it is believed that is because the ice has melted more 
quickly.  So  the  water  levels  have  gone  down  and  our  barges  are 
having  trouble  getting  in  and  it  is  less  economical  for  commerce. 
Up in Duluth, we have had many invasive species that are deci-
mating  the  lake’s  ecosystems  and  damaging  with  both  commercial 
and  recreational  activities.  And  the  harbor  and  open  water  infra-
structure that used to manage these problems continues to deterio-
rate  with  age,  something  I  am  sure  you  will  hear  about  as  well 
from Congressman Oberstar over on the House side. 

I  believe  the  work  of  NOAA’s  Great  Lakes  Environmental  Re-
search Laboratory is essential to properly sustain the Great Lakes’ 
ecosystems. And I wondered your views about addressing the ongo-
ing  environmental  initiatives  being  handled  by  the  Great  Lakes 
laboratory.

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Thank you, Senator. I embrace the challenge of 
coming  up  to  speed  on  many  of  the  issues  in  the  Great  Lakes  be-
cause,  of  course,  I  am  less  familiar  with  those.  Because  I  have  not 
been  at  NOAA,  I  have  not  had  an  opportunity  to  be  briefed  on  all 
of  the  work  of  that  laboratory.  I  am  aware  of  a  number  of  col-
leagues who work in that laboratory and have great respect for the 
work  that  they  do,  but  I  do  not  pretend  to  know  it  in  any  great 
depth.  I  would,  if  confirmed,  look  forward  to  learning  a  lot  more 
about it and working closely with you to make it be the best it can 
be. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Well, thank you. 
And  you  also  indicated  your  support  for  the  creation  of  a  Na-
tional Climate Service within NOAA. And I also hope that you will 
consider the Great Lakes as part of that as well. 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Absolutely, Senator. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  OK,  very  good.  As  I  noted,  we  really  have 
seen a lot of changes because of the climate change issue, and they 
are  very  different  than  the  sea  levels  rising.  We  have  seen  the 
waters going down. 

The invasive species issue is something this Committee has grap-
pled with, and we would really like to do more on that. And many 
of  these  species  enter  our  waters  through  the  ballast  water  dis-
charged by ocean-faring vessels as they enter U.S. ports. Could you 
talk about that issue and if you have considered that? We have had 
some disputes about getting this done, and I really believe we need 
to be pragmatic and get something done on the ballast water issue. 
Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  we  have  seen  huge  increases  in  the 
number  of  invasive  species  around  the  United  States  and,  indeed, 
globally. As you are well aware, there is strong evidence that many 
of  those  species  are  introduced  through  ballast  water  being  trans-
ported from one country to another or one part of a country to an-
other part. 

This  is  an  area  where  I  believe  there  are  opportunities  for  re-
search to help understand how to better treat ballast water. There 
are existing techniques that involve exchange of ballast water mid- 
ocean,  so  if  a  vessel  is  coming  from,  let  us  say,  Europe  over  to  the 
Great  Lakes,  to  discharge  its  ballast  in  the  middle  of  the  Atlantic 
and  take  in  oceanic  water  that  is  less  likely  to  have  invasive  spe-
cies  for  coastal  areas,  Great  Lakes  areas.  Those  techniques  incur 
some cost and under bad weather conditions can, in fact, be a risk 
in terms of safety. So they are not perfect. 

I believe that there is ample opportunity to do a better job of rec-
ognizing  the  destabilizing  impact  of  these  invasive  species  and  the 
economic  consequences  of  them  much  more  broadly  than  is  cur-
rently appreciated and make better progress in figuring out how to 
prevent  them  from  becoming  established  to  begin  with.  This  is 
partly an area of research and partly an area where it is a matter 
of  policy—just  deciding  how  important  it  is  to  actually  have  the 
kinds of regulations that would make a difference in this area. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Very  good.  Thank  you.  And  I  know  with 
Senator  Cantwell’s  leadership  with  the  work  that  she  has  done 
with oceans, and the Chairman’s leadership here, I am hopeful we 
will  be  able  to  get  something  done.  As  you  know,  there  has  been 
some pending legislation about ballast waters that has been sitting

around for a while. I have only been here 2 years, but it seems like 
2 years too long. So we hope to get something done.

Dr.  Holdren.  I  hope  with  our  Subcommittee  on  Innovation  and 
Competitiveness, we will be able to work with you in the future as

Senator Vitter? 

STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator  VITTER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thanks  to  both  of 

you for being here. 

Dr.  Holdren,  one  of  the  lines  from  the  President’s  inaugural  ad-
dress,  which  I  most  appreciated,  was  his  comment  about  science 
and honoring that and not having it overtaken by ideology. My con-
cern is that as one of his top science advisors, many statements you 
have  made  in  the  past  do  not  meet  that  test,  and  so  I  wanted  to 
explore that. 

One is from a 1971 article with Paul Ehrlich titled ‘‘Global Ecol-
ogy’’  in  which  you  predicted  that  ‘‘some  form  of  eco-catastrophe,  if 
not thermonuclear war, seems almost certain to overtake us before 
the  end  of  the  century.’’  Do  you  think  that  was  a  responsible  pre-
diction? 

Dr. HOLDREN. Well, thank you, Senator, for that question. 
First  of  all,  I  guess  I  would  say  that  one  of  the  things  I  have 
learned  in  the  intervening  nearly  4  decades  is  that  predictions 
about the future are difficult. That was a statement which at least 
at  the  age  of  26  I  had  the  good  sense  to  hedge  by  saying  ‘‘almost 
certain.’’ 

The  trends  at  the  time  were  not  positive  either  with  respect  to 
the dangers of thermonuclear war or with respect to ecological dan-
gers  of  a  wide  variety  of  sorts.  A  lot  of  things  were  getting  worse. 
I  would  argue  that  the  motivation  for  looking  at  the  downside 
possibilities,  the  possibilities  that  can  go  wrong  if  things  continue 
in  a  bad  direction,  is  to  motivate  people  to  change  direction.  That 
was  my  intention  at  the  time.  In  many  respects,  there  were 
changes  in  direction  which  reduced  both  the  probability  of  nuclear 
war,  in  part  through  arms  control  agreements,  and  there  were 
changes  in  direction  in  national  and  international  policy  with  re-
spect  to  environmental  problems,  including  a  good  many  laws 
passed by this Congress. 

Senator VITTER. Given all of that context, do you think that was 

a responsible prediction at the time? 

Dr. HOLDREN. Senator, with respect, I would want to distinguish 
between predictions and description of possibilities which we would 
like  to  avert,  and  I  think  it  is  responsible  to  call  attention  to  the 
dangers  that  society  faces  so  we  will  make  the  investments  and 
make the changes needed to reduce those dangers. 

Senator  VITTER.  Well,  I  would  call  ‘‘seems  almost  certain’’  a  pre-

diction, but that is just a difference of opinion. 

Specifically, what science was that prediction based on?

58 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Well,  it  was  based  in  the  ecological  domain  on  a 
lot  of  science,  on  the  evidence  of  the  accumulation  of  persistent 
toxic substances in the body fat of organisms all around the planet, 
on  the  rise  of  the  atmospheric  concentrations  of  carbon  dioxide,  of 
sulfur  oxides,  of  particulate  matter,  on  trace  metals  accumulating 
in  various  parts  of  the  environment  in  large  quantities,  the  de-
struction of tropical forests at a great rate—— 

Senator  VITTER.  Has  all  of  that  dramatically  reversed  so  that 

this almost certainty has, obviously, been averted? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Some  of  it  has  reversed,  and  I  am  grateful  for 
that. Again, I think it has been reversed in part because of sensible 
laws passed by the U.S. Congress signed by various Presidents. 

Some of it has not reversed. We continue to be on a perilous path 
with  respect  to  climate  change,  and  I  think  we  need  to  do  more 
work to get that one reversed as well. 

Senator VITTER. OK. 
Another  statement.  In  1986,  you  predicted  that  global  warming 
could cause the deaths of 1 billion people by 2020. Would you stick 
to that statement today? 

Dr. HOLDREN. Well, again, I would not have called it a prediction 
then and I would not call it a prediction now. I think it is unlikely 
to happen, but it is—— 

Senator VITTER. Do you think it could happen? 
Dr. HOLDREN. I think it could happen, and the way it could hap-
pen  is  climate  crosses  a  tipping  point  in  which  a  catastrophic  de-
gree  of  climate  change  has  severe  impacts  on  global  agriculture.  A 
lot of people depend on that. 

Senator VITTER. So you would stick to that statement? 
Dr. HOLDREN. I do not think it is likely. I think we should invest 

effort, considerable effort, to reduce the likelihood further. 

Senator  VITTER.  But  you  would  stick  to  the  statement  that  it 

could happen—— 

Dr. HOLDREN. It could happen. 
Senator VITTER. One billion by 2020. OK. 
Dr. HOLDREN. It could. 
Senator VITTER. In 1973, you encouraged a ‘‘decline in fertility to 
well below replacement’’ in the United States because ‘‘280 million 
in 2040 is likely to be too many.’’ What would your number for the 
right population in the U.S. be today? 

Dr. HOLDREN. I no longer think it is productive, Senator, to focus 
on  the  optimum  population  for  the  United  States.  I  do  not  think 
any of us know what the right answer is. When I wrote those lines 
in  1973,  I  was  preoccupied  with  the  fact  that  many  problems  the 
United  States  faced  appeared  to  be  being  made  more  difficult  by 
the rate of population growth that then prevailed. I think everyone 
who  studies  these  matters  understands  that  population  growth 
brings  some  benefits  and  some  liabilities.  It  is  a  tough  question  to 
determine which will prevail in a given time period. 

But  I  think  the  key  thing  today  is  that  we  need  to  work  to  im-
prove the conditions that all of our citizens face economically, envi-
ronmentally,  and  in  other  respects,  and  we  need  to  aim  for  some-
thing that I have for years been calling sustainable prosperity. 

Senator VITTER. Well, since we are at 304 million, I am certainly 

heartened that you are not sticking to the 280 million figure.

But much more recently, namely a couple weeks ago in response 
to  my  written  questions,  you  did  say  on  this  matter  ‘‘balancing 
costs  and  benefits  of  population  growth  is  a  complex  business,  of 
course,  and  reasonable  people  can  disagree  about  where  it  comes 
out.’’  I  will  be  quite  honest  with  you.  I  am  not  concerned  about 
where you or I might come out. I am scared to death that you think 
this  is  a  proper  function  of  Government,  which  is  what  that  sen-
tence clearly implies. Do you think determining optimal population 
is a proper role of Government? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  No,  Senator,  I  do  not  and  I  certainly  did  not  in-
tend  that  to  be  the  implication  of  that  sentence.  The  sentence 
means  only  what  it  says,  which  is  that  people  who  have  thought 
about these matters come out in different places. 

I  think  the  proper  role  of  Government  is  to  develop  and  deploy 
the  policies  with  respect  to  economy,  environment,  and  security 
that  will  ensure  the  well-being  of  the  citizens  we  have.  I  also  be-
lieve that many of those policies will have the effect and have had 
the effect in the past of lowering birth rates, because when you pro-
vide  health  care  for  women,  opportunities  for  women,  and  edu-
cation, people tend to have smaller families on average. And it ends 
up  being  easier  to  solve  some  of  our  other  problems  when  that  oc-
curs. 

Senator  VITTER.  Final  question.  In  2006,  obviously  pretty  re-
cently, in an article, The War on Hot Air, you suggested that global 
sea levels could rise by 13 feet by the end of this century. Now, in 
contrast  to  that,  the  IPCC’s  2007  report  put  their  estimate  at  be-
tween  7  and  25  inches.  So  their  top  line  was  25  inches,  about  2 
feet. What explains the disparity? Why is the IPCC 600 percent off 
in their top level assessment? 

Dr. HOLDREN. The disparity, Senator, is that the IPCC chose not 
to include in that numerical estimate the mechanisms by which the 
great  ice  sheets  on  Antarctica  and  Greenland  could  disintegrate 
very rapidly in a warming world. What they considered is the effect 
of—— 

Senator VITTER. Do you think it was a mistake? 
Dr.  HOLDREN.  No,  I  do  not  say  it  was  a  mistake.  In  the  IPCC’s 
report, it says we are not going to include those rapid mechanisms 
because  our  models  are  not  yet  good  enough  to  represent  them 
quantitatively  in  terms  of  how  much  they  could  do  by  a  particular 
year. 

My  statement  was  based  on  articles  in  the  journals  of  Science 
and  Nature—peer-reviewed  publications  by  some  of  the  world’s 
leading specialists in studying ice, who had concluded that twice in 
the  last  19,000  years  in  natural  warming  periods  of  similar  pace 
to  the  warming  period  that  we  are  experiencing  now  in  large  part 
because  of  human  activities,  sea  level  went  up  by  as  much  as  2  to 
5 meters per century. 

The  2006  quote  was  not  from  an  article  I  wrote.  It  was  from  an 
interview  in  which  I  was  quoted,  where  I  had  mentioned  that  re-
search  which  had  indicated  that  those  high  rates  were  possible. 
And the IPCC did not refute that. It simply said our models cannot 
represent the phenomena that produce these high rates in the past, 
so  we  have  produced  an  estimate  that  only  includes  some  of 
the——

Senator  VITTER.  So  bottom  line,  do  you  think  the  better  worst 

case estimate is 25 inches or 13 feet? 

Dr. HOLDREN. The newer analyses that have been done since the 
IPCC  report  came  out  indicate  that  the  upper  limit  for  the  year 
2100  is  probably  between  1  and  2  meters,  and  those  are  the  num-
bers that I now quote because they are the latest science. 
Senator VITTER. So you would no longer quote 13 feet. 
Dr.  HOLDREN.  I  would  no  longer  quote  13  feet  because  newer 

science indicates that the upper limit is only about 6.5 feet. 

Senator VITTER. But going back to my first question. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator is almost at 10 minutes. 
Senator  VITTER.  Just  a  final  followup.  You  would  still  say—I 
think  you  did—that  1  billion  people  lost  by  2020  is  still  a  possi-
bility? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  It  is  a  possibility  and  one  we  should  work  ener-

getically to avoid. 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator  Cantwell,  followed  by  Senator  Warner. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too look forward 
to  working  with  you  in  your  capacity  as  Chairman  of  this  Com-
mittee  and  working  with  you  on  the  Oceans,  Atmosphere,  and 
Coast Guard Committee. 

And  thank  you  to  both  of  the  nominees  before  us  today.  We  ap-

preciate your willingness to serve. 

I  am  sure  my  questions  may  be  seen  as  a  little  more  specific  to 
the  Pacific  Northwest  region,  but  I  hope  you  will  indulge  me  be-
cause I have many. And I will start with you, Dr. Lubchenco. 

Obviously,  the  Columbia  River  salmon  biological  opinion  has 
come  a  long  way,  but  not  without  a  lot  of  court  intervention.  So  I 
guess  I  would  like  to  start  with:  do  you  think  that  poor  manage-
ment  within  the  Government  led  to  those  court  interventions  and 
decisions? And what would you do to avoid that same—what would 
you  change  under  NOAA  to  make  sure  that  we  do  not  end  up  in 
the courts again? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  think  this  has  been  one  of  the  most 
challenging  issues  for  the  Pacific  Northwest.  I  think  the  situation 
that  we  are  in  now  is  a  result  of  a  long  history  of  finger-pointing 
at  other  drivers  of  change,  both  on  the  land  side  and  the  ocean 
side, and that there was a significant amount of time lost to denial 
of a problem and trying to blame it on someone else instead of mov-
ing on with achieving solutions. 

I  have  not  had  the  benefit  of  briefings  from  NOAA’s  staff  about 
the  current  state  of  play  and  would  pledge  to  you  to  come  up  to 
speed  on  that,  if  I  am  confirmed,  as  soon  as  possible  and  to  work 
with  you  to  try  to  identify  the  ways  that  we  can  resolve  these 
issues. I simply do not have enough information. 

Senator CANTWELL. How confident are you, though, that you can 
keep us out of the courts by having a strong management response, 
as opposed to punting and then having the courts decide? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Obviously,  it  would  be  much  better  not  to  have 
to  have  it  go  to  the  courts,  and  I  would  make  every  effort  to  do 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

61 

that. I do not have enough information right now to know how pos-
sible that is. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  think  what  we  will  do  is  follow  up  with 
some  specific  questions  on  that  then.  So  maybe  it  will  give  you  a 
chance to become a little more familiar with it. 

A second issue which you and I have had a chance to talk about 
in my office is obviously the impact of hurricane-force winds off the 
coast  of  Washington,  and  we  have  had  quite  a  bit  of  damage  from 
this in the last couple of seasons. Obviously, we have a huge Dopp-
ler  radar  gap  there.  Do  you  agree  that  we  need  to  solve  this  prob-
lem? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Absolutely,  Senator,  and  it  seems  like  it  is  one 

that is solvable. 

under your tenure time? 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  would  you  say  that  this  would  be  solved 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  I  would  anticipate  working  with  you  to  solve 

that. 

few years? 

Senator CANTWELL. Do you think we can solve it within the next 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Senator, you are probably a better judge of that 

than I am, but I would—— 

more than a few years. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  would  hope  your  tenure  time  would  be 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  I  would  like  to  solve  this,  and  I  would  work 
with  you  to  try  to  do  that.  I  do  not  know  how  long  it  is  going  to 
take. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  The  Puget  Sound  Partnership  is  an  innova-
tive  collaborative  effort  in  the  Northwest  I  think  you  are  familiar 
with. It is an eco-based management approach to our fisheries and 
ecosystem  and  ocean  governance.  If  confirmed,  would  you  put  re-
sources toward this kind of effort in helping Puget Sound on its re-
covery plans? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  agree  with  you  completely  that  this 
is  a  model  partnership  in  part  because  it  acknowledges  the  deep 
interactions  between  a  variety  of  different  sectors  on  the  land  side 
and  how  those  activities  affect  the  health  and  well-being  of  Puget 
Sound  and,  therefore,  the  people  in  the  Puget  Sound  area.  I  think 
it  is  a  model  that  is  eminently  worthy  of  supporting  and  of  emu-
lating. I think it is a really nice partnership. 

The  extent  to  which  I  would  have  resources  available  to  con-
tribute  significantly  I  cannot  judge  at  this  time.  Part  of  my  chal-
lenge  is  that  because  I  have  only  been  a  nominee,  I  have  not  been 
able  to  be  at  NOAA.  I  have  not  had  briefings  on  issues  in  depth, 
including the budget. So I need to come up to speed on that before 
giving  you  a  more  definitive  answer  on  that.  But  I  do  believe  the 
partnership  is  extremely  important  and  I  would  hope  there  would 
be opportunity to support it financially as well as verbally. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Let  us  try  the  southern  resident  orca  popu-
lation.  Obviously,  NOAA  has  already—basically  it  said  that  it  be-
lieves  that  it  can  take  this  from  an  endangered  species  to  a 
delisting  of  the  species  back  to  levels,  they  think,  from  maybe  28 
years ago. So if confirmed, under your leadership, what kind of re-
sources do you see dedicated to delisting that population?

62 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  I  cannot  answer  the  resources  ques-
tion.  I  can  tell  you  that  I  think  that  this  is  something  that  is  ex-
tremely important and I would make it a priority. 

Senator CANTWELL. Do you think 28 years is a reasonable recov-

ery time? 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Senator, I assume that those numbers are part-
ly  a  function  of  analyses  based  on  the  growth  rates  of  the  popu-
lations  and  the  extent  to  which  they  are  currently  under  stress.  I 
have  not  looked  at  those  analyses  in  depth  but  I  would  anticipate 
doing so and would be eager to do so. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  do  not  want  to  ignore  Dr.  Holdren.  Maybe 

we can get him in on this question. 

Last year the Coast Guard Commandant testified before our Sub-
committee  that  as  far  as  resources,  he  thought  that  we  had  inad-
equate  resources  to  respond  to  oil  spills  in  the  Arctic.  And  I  want 
to know if either of you believe that our Government has the capa-
bility  to  effectively  respond  in  the  Arctic  Ocean  and  what  the  Ad-
ministration can promise us that we will be doing to better protect 
that area. 

Dr. HOLDREN. Well, Senator, I do think that we have been devot-
ing  inadequate  resources  to  our  ability  to  operate  in  the  Arctic.  I 
think  we  are  down  to  two  heavy  icebreakers  in  the  Coast  Guard, 
both  near  the  end  of  their  operational  life.  That  is  a  particularly 
serious  problem  for  our  capacity  to  operate  in  the  Arctic  in  an  era 
when  other  countries  are  expanding  their  activities  there.  The  ca-
pacity to respond to oil spills is, in my judgment, also not adequate, 
and  I  think  we  are  going  to  have  to  take  a  careful  look  at  how  to 
increase  the  resources  available  to  the  Coast  Guard  and  the  other 
relevant  agencies  so  that  we  can  do  a  better  job  in  that  important 
region.  That  is,  again,  something  else  that,  if  confirmed,  I  would 
certainly  expect  to  be  working  with  members  of  this  Committee 
about. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you very much. I see my time has ex-

pired, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. 
Senator Warner? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK WARNER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator WARNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the op-

portunity to be here and welcome the nominees. 

One  of  the  things  I  am  still  mastering—Dr.  Holdren,  maybe  you 
can  help  me  on  a  technology  piece  here—is  as  a  freshman  Senator 
how  you  appear  at  three  different  hearings  that  are  scheduled  si-
multaneously. I have not mastered that yet. So my apologies about 
missing the front part of the hearing. 

I  do  want  to  start  with  you,  Dr.  Holdren,  though.  One  of  the 
areas that I am very interested in that the President has proposed 
is the creation of a chief technology officer that I believe will be re-
porting  to  you.  This  is  something  we  have  done  in  the  Common-
wealth  of  Virginia.  We  elevated  technology  to  a  cabinet  level  posi-
tion.  We  created  a  CIO.  I  think  it  was  one  of  the  things  that  led 
us to being named the best-managed State in the country.

As you look at the CTO position, do you see it more as an inter-
nal  function  working  with  the  CIO  at  OMB  to  bring  about  greater 
technology and efficiency inside the Federal Government, or do you 
see  this  as  another  kind  of  outreach  officer  to  spur  innovation 
across the broader technology community? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Well,  thank  you  for  that  question.  Because  no 
CTO  has  been  announced  yet  and  certainly  is  not  on  board  yet,  it 
is a little difficult to talk in detail about the division of responsibil-
ities.  But  I  think  the  concept  has  been  that  the  CIO  in  the  Office 
of  Management  and  Budget  is  basically  a  position  focused  on  the 
use  of  information  technology  within  the  Government  to  improve 
the  operations  of  the  Government,  to  improve  transparency,  open-
ness, efficiency, and so on, and the CTO position has been seen pri-
marily as an outward-reaching position whose primary responsibil-
ities are to see that we do a better job of exploiting not only infor-
mation technology but opportunities in other domains of technology 
to feed into the economic recovery that we so badly need and to ad-
dress the other major challenges that the country faces. I think the 
reason the President committed so early to creating a new CTO po-
sition, which the Government has never had, was to be able to bet-
ter  bring  technology  to  bear  on  these  big  challenges  for  the  whole 
society. 

Senator  WARNER.  So  you  would  envision  this  individual’s  scope 

being broader than IT and outward-looking. 

Dr. HOLDREN. Yes, absolutely. 
Senator WARNER. How about, though, the role—I understand the 
CIO role, the CIO role mostly focusing on the IT space, but as you 
think beyond IT, how you bring technology functionality to internal 
workings of Government, would that be CTO or CIO? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Again,  it  is  a  little  difficult  to  speculate  in  great 
detail  because  some  of  what  these  positions  will  be  will  depend  on 
the  characteristics  of  the  people  who  occupy  them,  and  that  is,  ob-
viously,  not  yet  settled.  But  I  think  across  the  domain  of  tech-
nology—information  technology,  communications  technology,  bio-
technology, nanotechnology—obviously there are opportunities both 
inside  and  outside  the  Government.  There  are  opportunities  to 
bring  additional  insights  about  technology  to  bear  on  questions  of 
national security, for example, inside the Government. 

But  again,  I  believe  that  the  President’s  primary  intention  and 
primary  aim  with  the  CTO  position,  which  has  been  on  his  policy 
agenda  since  early  in  the  campaign,  is  to  address  more  effectively 
the  opportunities  for  advanced  technology  to  be  brought  to  bear  in 
society  as  a  whole,  not  just  in  the  Government.  That  does  not  ex-
clude doing so in the Government. 

Senator  WARNER.  I  would  hope  as  this  role  is  fleshed  out—and 
recognizing  it  is  a  new  position  and  it  could  have  quite  a  large 
brief—I  would  hope  that  you  would  look  at  those  States  who  have 
maybe  gone  before.  And  we  have  made  mistakes.  I  think  actually 
Senator Cantwell’s State, Washington State, has been active in this 
area, but there may be lessons learned. 

Dr. HOLDREN. We will certainly be doing that. 
Senator  WARNER.  Dr.  Lubchenco,  let  me  welcome  you  as  well.  I 
may  be  somewhat  following  Senator  Cantwell  on  a  more  region- 
specific item and recognize that you may not be fully briefed up on

this.  But  what  is  critically  important  to  Virginia  and  the  sur-
rounding  States  is  the  health  of  the  Chesapeake  Bay,  and  NOAA 
has  played  an  important  role  in  that.  It  seems  like  over  the  last 
25  years,  we  have  been  partners  with  NOAA  and  we  oftentimes 
have  not  even  met  the  thresholds  that  we  would  have  hoped  to 
have met. I would argue that at least in recent years, the District, 
Virginia, Maryland, and States in the bay watershed have actually 
stepped  up  with  financial  resources  in  fairly  substantial  amounts. 
I  guess  what  I  would  ask  is,  recognizing  you  are  not  even  con-
firmed  yet,  but  do  you  have  a  sense  of  what  additional  authorities 
beyond  just  funding  that  NOAA  might  need  to  be  a  better  partner 
with  the  States  on  restoration  of  the  Chesapeake  Bay?  For  exam-
ple,  I  know  there  is  a  bay  monitoring  program  involving  a  series 
of  buoys  out  throughout  the  bay  that  seems  a  little  undermanned 
at this point. But if you could just speak to that specifically, if you 
have any knowledge, and then generally about the bay. 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Senator, I do not know the answer to your ques-
tion about relevant authority, and I would pledge to find out about 
that at the earliest possible moment. 

What I do think the Chesapeake Bay situation brings to the fore, 
though,  are  the  challenges  inherent  in  managing  activities  that 
cross  not  only  the  land  and  in  this  case  the  estuary,  the  bay,  but 
also  that  cross  multiple  jurisdictions,  local,  State,  multiple  States, 
as well as different State and Federal agencies. And that has been 
a  challenge.  I  think  the  model  of  working  across  those  and  setting 
up a multistate process is a good model. I think we have seen that 
some parts of that worked better than others, and having adequate 
funding was certainly one of the challenges. 

But  Chesapeake  Bay  really  is  a  microcosm  of  a  lot  of  the  larger 
ocean issues, coastal issues in particular, where there are activities 
on  land  that  impact  the  quality,  the  health  of  the  ecosystems  and 
therefore  the  resources  and  the  jobs  that  are  available,  and  fig-
uring  out  the  right  mechanisms  to  do  that  integration  is  a  huge 
challenge. 

One  of  my  goals  at  NOAA  is  to  bring  a  more  holistic  under-
standing  of  these  interactions  across  different  sectors  and  to  think 
about  marine  spatial  planning  in  a  comprehensive  sense  with  all 
appropriate parties and to do a better job of resolving issues before 
they get to be so incredibly challenging that it is very, very difficult 
to do something about them. 

Senator  WARNER.  Well,  thank  you.  I  would  simply  add  that  as 
the  Nation’s  largest  estuary  and  one  that  still  remains  in  great 
jeopardy, I do believe the States in the state compact have stepped 
up  their  game  over  the  last  4  or  5  years,  both  in  terms  of  water 
standards, in terms of runoff, in terms of funding. But we have not 
had  a  collaborative  partner  at  the  Federal  level,  and  we  look  for-
ward  to  having  that  kind  of  collaboration  going  forward.  So  thank 
you. 

Dr. LUBCHENCO. Great. I look forward to that, Senator. 
Senator WARNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Warner. 
I  will  just  conclude  my  part.  Senator  Begich  then  has  a  follow- 
up  question,  and  then  I  will  have  a  statement  to  make  before  we 
conclude.

This  is  not  part  of  your  responsibility,  Dr.  Holdren,  but  I  judge 
you  to  be  of  such  a  high  caliber  that  I  know  that  you  will  accept 
this responsibility. 

I think one of the greatest embarrassments in the United States 
of  America  is  the  fact  that  we  have  an  air  traffic  control  system 
which  is  analog.  We  are  the  only  country  in  the  western  world.  In 
fact,  Mongolia  is  ahead  of  us.  They  are  building  a  digital  GPS  air 
traffic  control  system.  The  consequences  of  this  are  overwhelming 
because  if  it  were  to  be  solved,  it  might  clear  up  delays  by  30  per-
cent or more. 

What  I  am  saying  to  you  is  that  we  have  a  President  now  who 
seems to be enormously interested in technology and efficiency and 
doing  things  in  the  right  way.  You  will  have  the  opportunity,  be-
cause of your position, of being face to face with him. We have tried 
in  our  committee  to  do  this,  and  we  can  never  get  the  money  be-
cause  of  various  reasons.  I  do  not  know  if  the  President  is  aware 
of  this  or  not  because  I  have  not  talked  with  him  about  it,  but  I 
just hope very much that you will. I think it is a supremely impor-
tant  national  requirement.  It  does  fit  into  science  and  technology. 
The  science  and  the  technology  are  all  solved  and  they  are  avail-
able.  It  is  the  fact  that  we  will  not  put  them  to  work.  And  I  hope 
that you will agree to do that. 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Well,  Senator,  you  were  generous  saying  it  is  not 
my  responsibility  because,  in  fact,  it  is  my  responsibility  anyplace 
that  science  and  technology  are  not  being  put  to  the  appropriate 
and  needed  uses  across  all  the  domains  of  the  Federal  agencies.  I 
am  supposed  to  look  for  the  gaps  and  help  see  that  the  holes  are 
filled. And this is a gap. It is an important one. The President actu-
ally  has  recognized  it.  It  is  certainly,  if  you  will  forgive  this  par-
ticular  metaphor,  on  the  radar  screen  of  the  administration,  and  I 
am determined to fix it and I know the President is determined to 
fix it. 

The CHAIRMAN. My day is brighter. 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, sir. 
Dr.  Lubchenco,  I  would  like  you  to  do  something  for  me,  when 
confirmed.  The  National  Weather  Service  provides  the  Federal 
Aviation  Administration  with  weather  forecasting  services,  and 
there is this rather large controversy that is going on right now be-
cause the suggestion is because—as you know, if you take off from 
Dulles,  you  get  passed  on  from  what  they  call  TRACON  to 
TRACON.  And  there  are  now  21  of  them  across  the  country,  and 
there is a suggestion that it be reduced to two. That would be high-
ly efficient. That is met with some resistance, obviously, from some 
of  the  employees.  And  then  there  are  some  who  say  that  it  could 
involve safety issues. 

But I think it is one of those things that—because it does involve 
weather, the National Weather Service, I think it is something that 
you  could  help  in  trying  to  resolve.  It  is  not  so  much  a  study  or 
a commission I am looking for. It is a bringing together of the par-
ties so that we can quickly proceed one way or another. 

Would you put your attention to that?

Dr. LUBCHENCO. I certainly would, Mr. Chairman. I do not know 
the  details  of  this  issue.  I  appreciate  that  it  is  an  important  one, 
and I would look into it. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Begich? 
Senator BEGICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Dr. Holdren, I am going to kind of read the question here. I have 

a question then, for both of you I just have a request. 

First  off,  I  appreciate  both  of  you  talking  about  the  Arctic  policy 
and  how  important  that  is,  and  I  think  that  is  a  huge,  evolving 
issue  that  the  administration  and  the  Congress  will  continue  to 
deal with. 

The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 created the U.S. Arc-
tic  Research  Commission  as  an  independent  agency  that  provides 
goals  for  Arctic  research,  and  created  the  interagency  Arctic  Re-
search  and  Policy  Committee  which  implements  these  goals.  The 
Commission, the Committee, your office, and the Office of Manage-
ment  and  Budget  have  specific  responsibilities  outlined  in  the  act. 
Yet,  to  be  very  frank  with  you,  these  entities  have  never  really 
worked together, never presented a combined budget for this effort. 
Will  you  use  your  office  to  lead  this  effort,  once  and  for  all,  to 
get a combined effort from a budgetary standpoint and from reach-
ing the policy goals? 

Dr.  HOLDREN.  Yes,  Senator.  That  is  an  easy  one.  The  OMB  and 
the  OSTP  are  supposed  to  work  together  on  discharging  those 
kinds  of  responsibilities,  making  sure  that  interdisciplinary  cross- 
agency  efforts  and  new  initiatives  of  this  sort  are  included  in  the 
science  and  technology  funding  priorities  going  forward.  I  am  not 
familiar  with  all  the  details  of  this  case  and  how  it  has  been  han-
dled in the past, but I can certainly promise you—— 

Senator BEGICH. We will provide you with some material. 
Dr. HOLDREN. And I can certainly promise you that, if confirmed, 
I  will  take  that  up  with  the  OMB  Director  as  part  of  our  mandate 
to  get  these  science  and  technology  priorities  right  in  the  budget 
going forward. 

Senator BEGICH. Excellent. 
And  just  one  request  for  both  of  you,  not  for  today.  But  as  I  sat 
here  listening  to  all  the  questions,  most  of  them  relevant  to  your 
positions and the issues of what you are talking about, Arctic policy 
is  going  to  be  huge.  And  I  would  just  be  interested  from  your  per-
spective—I  am  a  very  visual  person,  and  I  am  afraid  to  ask  this 
question  because  I  am  afraid  of  what  the  outcome  will  look  like. 
But  how  you  see  and  whom  you  see  will  be  involved  in  the  deci-
sions  of  Arctic  policy  into  the  future  by  agency,  so  a  very  visual 
chart  for  me  would  be  very  helpful.  I  am  afraid  to  ask  for  this  be-
cause  I  am  afraid  that  every  Department  division  of  the  Federal 
Government now believes they have a role in it, which is great, ex-
cept it will be probably the most disorganized effort. So I would be 
curious  at  some  point  if  you  could  provide  to  me,  whichever  one  of 
you that would be the most appropriate, a chart of how you see and 
what  agencies  you  see—because  I  know  there  are  jurisdiction 
issues.  I  know  in  Congress  there  are  jurisdiction  issues.  But  if  we 
do  not  figure  that  out,  we  are  never  going  to  get  to  a  comprehen-
sive policy. So I will just leave that request with you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Senator Cantwell? 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
This  for  Dr.  Holdren  or  Dr.  Lubchenco.  How  do  you  intend  to 
make sure that agencies like NOAA have adequate say in our Gov-
ernment’s policy choices, especially as it relates to offshore drilling? 
And  the  reason  I  bring  this  up—and  I  know  my  colleague  from 
Alaska might be leaving. Maybe he will stay. Yes, have a seat. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  CANTWELL.  In  a  letter  commenting  on  the  EIS  for  the 
Chukchi  Sea  oil  and  gas  drilling  plan,  the  National  Marine  Fish-
eries  Service  wrote  the  Minerals  Management  Service  analysis  did 
not  present  a  strong  enough  case  to  NMFS  that  the  marine  re-
sources would be adequately protected. Yet, this advice, along with 
similar  advice  from  EPA  and  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  was  ig-
nored by the Minerals Management Service. So what do you intend 
to  do  to  make  sure  that  these  agencies  who  are  in  charge  of  pro-
tecting  these  resources  are  heard  on  these  important  issues  as  it 
relates to offshore drilling? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  Senator,  you  have  highlighted  what  I  believe  is 
one  of  the  real  challenges  of  different  agencies,  different  jurisdic-
tions having different kinds of responsibilities, all of which overlap 
in  the  same  place.  I  believe  that  the  sectoral  management  of  dif-
ferent  activities  in  oceans  does  not  serve  us  well  and  needs  to  be 
converted  into  a  more  thoughtful  mechanism  for  doing  more  holis-
tic planning of which activities’ and which sectors’ uses are compat-
ible with one another in a particular place. And this inevitably, as 
you have highlighted, entails interagency not only coordination and 
cooperation, but a mechanism for—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I  mean,  to  be  blunt,  it  sounds  like  the 
Minerals  Management  agency  blew  off  NMFS.  So  what  are  you 
going to do to make sure that that does not happen again? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  I  anticipate  working  directly  through  the  Sec-
retary of Commerce and with the other relevant Secretaries, for ex-
ample,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  but  also  utilizing  the  Council 
on Environmental Quality and the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy to help establish from the outset a mechanism for not letting 
that happen. 

Senator CANTWELL. Dr. Holdren? 
Dr.  HOLDREN.  If  I  can  add  one  thing  to  that.  There  is  an  entity 
called  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  which  has  ex-
isted  in  the  White  House,  organized  by  the  Office  of  Science  and 
Technology  Policy,  but  bringing  together  all  of  the  Executive 
Branch  agencies  typically  at  the  deputy  level  that  have  roles  in 
science  and  technology.  And  this  is  a  place  where  in  the  past  one 
has  been  able  to  address  crosscutting  and  overlapping  jurisdiction 
issues effectively. In the last 8 years, it has languished. It was not 
really  fully  utilized  in  the  last  administration,  but  our  intention— 
certainly  my  intention,  if  confirmed,  would  be  to  revive  it  and  uti-
lize  it  fully  to  try  to  reduce  the  sorts  of  problems  that  you  point 
to here. 

The  other  thing  I  would  mention  again  is  I  think  we  have  in 
prospect  a  set  of  people  across  the  relevant  agencies  who  are  un-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

commonly  experienced  at  communicating  with  each  other,  and  be-
yond  the  structural  approaches  to  this  through  the  NSTC,  for  ex-
ample, I think we are going to have some success in avoiding these 
problems that come from crosscutting issues and overlapping juris-
dictions just because we are going to talk to each other more. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  one  area  in  which  I  think  we  need  to 
better  understand  the  response  is  on  the  Office  of  Response  and 
Restoration  for  oil  spills,  and  we  certainly  have  not  funded  that 
program at the level of the President’s request. What do you think 
the  impact  of  that  is  on  cutting  back  on  our  Nation’s  oil  spill  re-
sponse capabilities? 

Dr.  LUBCHENCO.  I  think  it  puts  us  at  risk  that  is  not  really  ac-

ceptable, Senator. 

Senator CANTWELL. Dr. Holdren? 
Dr. HOLDREN. I agree. We need to fix it. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. 
Dr.  HOLDREN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  realize  I  am  in  danger  of  failing 
to introduce my family and friends who have accompanied me here 
and  have  supported  me  in  this  hearing.  I  do  want  to  mention  that 
my  wife  of  43  years,  Dr.  Cheryl  Holdren,  is  right  behind  me,  and 
that  some  of  our  dearest  friends  from  Woods  Hole,  Bill  and  Pi 
Smith, have come to lend their moral support as well. So I wanted 
to thank them for that before we go any further. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes.  I  think  thanking  your  wife  for  being  here 

is probably pretty important. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  would  like  to  conclude  this  with  the  following 

comments. 

Number  one,  this  is  what  you  hope  for  in  Government.  Dr. 
Holdren,  you  are  happily  ensconced  exactly  where  you  are.  I  can 
even  give  you  your  address.  But  it  is  a  very  good  life  that  you  are 
leading. The same with you, Dr. Lubchenco. And yet you are giving 
that  up  for  the  purpose  of  coming  to  serve  your  Government.  And 
I think you do that, one, because you suspect that this is an admin-
istration  which  really  cares  about  what  you  do.  It  is  going  to  re-
spond to what you do. 

But  more  importantly,  I  think  that  you  are  both  very  worried 
about  the  future  of  the  planet  and  the  oceans  and  the  earth  and 
the people thereon and the wildlife thereon and the fish life there-
in. So it is a noble service that you do, and I do not think it should 
be left unthanked, even before you are confirmed, for your willing-
ness to do this. They talk about a new generation of concern about 
Americans,  but  mostly  at  that  level  they  are  talking  about  the 
younger people who came up through various campaigns, et cetera. 
And  you  are  both  very  young,  and  I  understand  that.  It  is  a  mag-
nificent service that you do our country and we are very, very lucky 
that you are doing it. 

With that in mind, before Senator Hutchison left, we agreed that 
we  would  try  to  move  your  nominations  by  unanimous  consent  on 
the floor of the Senate. Now, that means that we do not do it with-
in the Committee. But speed is very important here, for you to get

that, and I want you to know that.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

I  am  pleased  to  welcome  Jane  Lubchenco  and  my  good  friend  John  Holdren,  two 
of the most powerful voices in the scientific community on the issue of global climate 
change.  The  only  downside  that  I  can  think  of  with  respect  to  John’s  nomination 
is  that  I  won’t  get  to  visit  him  in  Falmouth  anymore.  John  has  been  an  incredible 
resource to the Woods Hole Institute and to the Kennedy School at Harvard Univer-
sity.  More  importantly,  he  has  been  a  tremendous  voice  on  the  critical  challenge  of 
global  climate  change,  and  we  are  very  fortunate  that  he  will  bring  that  voice  to 
this Administration. 

We  are  facing  a  true  crisis,  and  we  need  leaders  who  understand  the  scope  and 
urgency  of  the  problem  and  are  committed  to  taking  action  to  both  reduce  our  do-
mestic greenhouse gas emissions and actively reengage with the international proc-
ess.  The  reality  is  that  today,  the  most  critical  trends  and  facts  all  point  in  the 
wrong direction. CO2 emissions grew four times faster during the last 8 years than 
they  did  in  the  1990s.  Two  years  ago  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
Change  issued  a  series  of  projections  for  global  emissions,  based  on  likely  energy 
and land use patterns. Well, today emissions have actually moved beyond the worst 
case scenarios predicted by all of the IPCC’s models! Our oceans and forests are los-
ing their natural ability soak up and store greenhouse gases. This is a stronger cli-
mate forcing signal than expected, arriving sooner than expected. 

NOAA has a particularly important role in designing our Nation’s climate change 
research, assessment and response program, which frankly has been shamefully ne-
glected over the past 8 years. Dr. Lubchenco, I am encouraged by the work that has 
already  been  done  to  design  a  National  Climate  Service,  a  concept  that  Senator 
Snowe  and  I  first  advanced  last  year  in  the  Global  Change  Research  Improvement 
Act. I look forward to working together to ensure that the National Climate Service 
serves  an  important  function  in  providing  key  climate  information  to  mayors,  Gov-
ernors,  natural  resource  managers,  and  other  experts  working  on  the  ground  to  re-
spond to the ongoing impacts of global climate change. 

Dr.  Holdren,  as  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  you  will 
serve  as  a  trusted  voice  at  the  center  of  the  President’s  approach  to  climate  policy. 
I look forward to working with you to guide an agenda that focuses on clean energy 
and  climate  technology.  As  the  President  continues  to  build  his  budget  request,  I 
also  trust  that  you  will  serve  as  a  forceful  voice  within  the  Administration  for  full 
funding  of  the  America  COMPETES  Act.  In  2004,  China  graduated  six-hundred 
thousand engineers. The United States graduated just seventy-thousand. We cannot 
continue  to  ignore  the  fact  that  our  fiercest  competitors  on  the  global  stage  are  out 
performing us in the classroom and in the laboratory. 

Finally,  yesterday  the  House  of  Representatives  passed  H.R.  554,  the  National 
Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009. In the coming weeks, I’ll be re-
introducing companion legislation in the Senate, and I look forward to working with 
you  to  ensure  that  the  U.S.  is  in  position  to  drive  innovation  in  the  field  of  Nano-
technology  while  also  taking  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  nanotechnology  is 
safe for consumers, for workers, and for the environment. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
Mr.  Chairman:  I  am  pleased  today  to  express  my  support  for  the  confirmation  of 
Dr. John Holdren as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and 
Dr. Jane Lubchenco as the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.  Both  of  these  individuals  are  renowned  scientists  with  a  deep  un-
derstanding  of  the  environmental  challenges  we  currently  face—particularly  with 
respect  to  climate  change.  These  nominations  reflect  the  Obama  Administration’s

72 

strong  commitment  to  restoring  the  prominence  of  science  to  our  Nation  and  truly 
represent the change we have all been anticipating. 

I am confident that Dr. Holdren’s experience both as a scientist as well as a long-
time  advisor  on  science  and  technology  policy  will  provide  a  strong  foundation  for 
his work leading and coordinating our Nation’s many research and development pri-
orities. 

Dr.  Holdren’s  work  on  the  causes  and  consequences  of  global  environmental 
change  and  analysis  of  energy  technologies  and  policies  is  well  known.  As  Chair  of 
the  Environment  and  Public  Works  Committee,  developing  a  comprehensive  policy 
to  mitigate  and  respond  to  climate  change  is  one  of  my  greatest  priorities.  As  Con-
gress moves forward with a climate change bill this year, I look forward to working 
with  Dr.  Holdren  to  address  the  many  environmental  problems  that  our  commu-
nities, our Nation and our planet are facing. 

I  am  also  pleased  that  Dr.  Holdren  is  committed  to  help  coordinating  a  com-
prehensive  Federal  effort  to  bolster  America’s  competitiveness  in  science  and  tech-
nology,  and  meeting  the  goals  set  in  the  America  COMPETES  Act  passed  in  2007. 
Dr. Lubchenco’s broad expertise as a marine scientist and experience formulating 
recommendations  on  ocean  policymake  her  exceptionally  well  qualified  to  lead  the 
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  the  agency  responsible  for  co-
ordinating our Nation’s ocean research and policy programs. 

Dr.  Lubchenco  is  a  well-known  research  scientist  whose  expertise  bridges  a  wide 
range  of  issues  under  NOAA’s  jurisdiction,  including  the  impacts  of  climate  change 
on ocean ecosystems. 

Dr.  Lubchenco’s  work  to  promote  the  communication  of  science  to  policymakers 
makes  her  a  particularly  ideal  choice  for  this  position.  As  Founder  of  the  Aldo 
Leopold Leadership Program and a Founding Principal of the Communication Part-
nership  for  Science  and  the  Sea,  she  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to  improving 
the integration of science and policy. 

I  am  confident  that  Dr.  Lubchenco  has  a  deep  understanding  of  the  myriad 
threats facing our oceans and effective strategies for addressing them. As a Commis-
sioner for the Pew Oceans Commission and Joint Oceans Commission Initiative, Dr. 
Lubchenco  worked  to  identify  priorities  for  improving  management  of  our  oceans. 
My National Oceans Protection Act, which I introduced in the 109th and 110th Con-
gresses  and  plan  to  reintroduce  again  soon,  would  implement  the  recommendations 
of  these  Commissions  as  well  as  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy.  I  look  for-
ward  to  working  with  Dr.  Lubchenco  to  advance  these  priorities  in  this  Congress. 
I am truly inspired by the nomination of these two distinguished individuals and 
look forward to working with them to promote the scientific innovation that will fos-
ter our economy and provide us with the tools necessary to protect our communities 
from environmental degradation. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  As  Administrator,  your  Federal  fishery  management  responsibility 
will  be  substantial.  Our  fisheries  are  not  only  in  need  of  strong  conservation  man-
agement,  but  also  are  a  central  component  to  our  economy.  How  do  you  intend  to 
make  our  fisheries  sustainable  and  profitable,  while  meeting  the  requirements  of 
the  recently  reauthorized  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Manage-
ment Act? 

Answer.  I  support  the  goal  of  ending  overfishing  but  also  recognize  this  will  be 
a difficult task, one that will require the cooperation and commitment of the fishing 
industry  to  rebuild  these  resources.  The  Act  is  clear  that  annual  catch  limits  must 
be in place by 2010 that prevent overfishing. I understand that the regional fishery 
management  councils  are  working  hard  with  NOAA  to  meet  this  goal.  The  health 
of  our  marine  fish  stocks  is  directly  linked  to  the  health  of  many  coastal  commu-
nities. I will work with the councils and all stakeholders to ensure that overfishing 
is ended by the statutory deadline of 2010, based on the best science available, while 
carefully considering the economic consequences of our actions. 

Question  1a.  Are  there  any  new  approaches  you  intend  to  consider  for  improving 
the  performance  of  fishery  management,  particularly  regarding  strengthening  our 
Nation’s regulatory enforcement capabilities? 

Answer.  Providing  the  funding  needed  to  fully  implement  the  Magnuson-Stevens 
Act  is  not  only  critical  to  an  industry  that  contributes  over  $30  billion  to  the  U.S. 
Gross  National  Product,  but  also  to  ensuring  recreational  fishing  opportunities  and 
a  nutritious  source  of  food  for  Americans.  I  understand  NOAA  has  carefully  re-
viewed  the  requirements  associated  with  the  new  Magnuson-Stevens  Act,  and  has 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

73 

requested some significant increases to meet the statutory requirements in the last 
2  years.  I  believe  it  is  time  to  fully  fund  implementation  of  the  Magnuson  Act  and 
to provide sufficient funding for enforcement. I also believe we need to look at what 
has worked in some fisheries, such as a system of catch-shares as opposed to strin-
gent  ‘‘command  and  control’’  type  regulation,  and  see  if  we  have  sufficient  data  to 
make that system work in other fisheries. 

I also understand that NOAA just provided Congress a list of the worst offending 
countries with respect to IUU fishing—and that it included such countries as China 
and  Italy.  It  is  not  fair  to  our  fishermen  to  hold  them  to  a  higher  standard  than 
we  are  willing  to  require  of  the  rest  of  world’s  fish  products  that  are  sold  in  the 
United  States.  It  is  imperative  that  we  work  internationally  to  end  the  overfishing 
crisis  and  soon.  If  confirmed,  I  will  take  hard  look  at  the  problem  of  how  to  stop 
illegal fish from coming into the U.S. 

Question  2.  Dr.  Lubchenco,  many  of  the  issues  within  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  are  new  to  me  and  I  am  looking  forward  to  learning 
more about ocean and coastal management. Two topics that you have written exten-
sively  about  are  ecosystem-based  management  and  marine  protected  areas.  Could 
you tell me a bit more about your philosophy on using these two approaches as man-
agement tools for our oceans? 

As  Administrator,  what  steps  would  you  take  to  move  toward  a  more  ecosystem 
view  of  ocean  conservation  and  management,  including  improving  resilience  of 
coastal  communities  and  marine  ecosystems  and  resources  given  the  expected  im-
pacts of global warming and ocean acidification? 

Answer.  Ecosystem-based  management  is  far  superior  to  managing  ocean  re-
sources  on  a  sector-by-sector  basis  and  I  would  like  to  see  states  and  local  govern-
ments working toward using this approach. NOAA should lead by example—NOAA 
should look at its own management decisions on a more ecosystem basis rather than 
by sector or statute. I hope to implement greater regional governance within NOAA 
across  its  programs.  My  predecessor,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  began  the  difficult 
process of breaking down the ‘‘silos’’ within NOAA. If confirmed, I would like to con-
tinue and increase those efforts. 

Marine  protected  areas  are  one  tool  that  can  be  used  to  rebuild  fisheries,  safe-
guard ocean resources before they become depleted, and help ensure healthy oceans. 
Marine Protected Areas can be used in combination with other tools. However, each 
area  in  the  ocean  is  unique,  and  regulatory  options  should  be  evaluated  on  a  case- 
by-case  basis  to  determine  which  combination  of  tools  is  most  appropriate  to  meet 
the stated goals and objectives of the region. When declaring sanctuaries or marine 
protected  areas,  I  believe  we  must  ensure  an  open  and  inclusive  process  that  pro-
vides  all  stakeholders  an  opportunity  to  participate  as  described  in  both  the  Na-
tional Marine Sanctuaries Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 

Question  3.  Given  that  piecemeal  efforts  to  advance  offshore  aquaculture  are  oc-
curring, what is your position on the need for or your support of creating a national 
framework  for  aquaculture  in  the  United  States?  What  environmental  controls  are 
needed  to  support  the  industry  without  impacting  wild  fish  stocks  and  their  eco-
systems?  What  do  you  see  as  the  largest  barriers  to  a  healthy  U.S.  aquaculture  in-
dustry? 

Answer. Offshore aquaculture may be an important part of our future food supply. 
We need to put our best scientists to work to figure out if it is possible to raise fish 
in the open ocean in a manner that produces safe seafood and does not cause lasting 
harm to the marine environment. We are not there yet. Moreover, there are no per-
mits  yet  available  for  open  ocean  aquaculture  in  Federal  waters.  NOAA  does  not 
have  a  fully  implemented  national  aquaculture  program,  or  even  authority  to  issue 
these permits—it is still in the research and development phase. I will take a hard 
look  at  what  is  being  considered  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  to  determine  if  it  is  within 
the  Department’s  authority  to  allow  aquaculture  there.  Regardless,  we  must  begin 
to  develop  the  technology  and  the  permitting  process  to  be  prepared.  I  will  work 
with Congress to do just that. 

Question  4.  Dr.  Lubchenco,  in  December  of  last  year,  the  Government  Account-
ability Office released a report on the National Marine Fisheries Service and marine 
mammal protection. The report concluded that the National Marine Fisheries Serv-
ice  relies  on  incomplete,  outdated,  or  imprecise  information  about  human-caused 
mortality for many marine mammals stocks. Are you aware of this issue within the 
National Marine Fisheries Service? 

Answer. I was not aware of this issue. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. 
Question 4a. What steps do you plan on taking to address this issue? 
Answer.  I  will  re-double  the  agency’s  effort  to  conserve  marine  mammals  in  the 
face  of  increasing  threats  from  humans,  including  requesting  additional  funding  if 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

it  is  needed  to  meet  the  agency’s  statutory  obligations  under  the  Marine  Mammal 
Protection Act and Endangered Species Act. 

74 

Question 4b. I know there are a multitude of issues that need your immediate at-
tention  once  you  are  confirmed  as  the  next  Administrator  of  NOAA,  will  marine 
mammals be one of the issues on your radar screen? 

Answer. Absolutely, yes. 
Question  5.  Dr.  Lubchenco,  I  am  concerned  with  the  status  of  the  International 
Whaling  Commission.  If  confirmed  for  Administrator  of  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  what  steps  do  you  plan  to  take  to  try  and  strengthen 
the  International  Whaling  Commission  and  reduce  the  number  of  whales  that  are 
still killed each year? 

Answer.  Unfortunately,  despite  the  International  Whaling  Commission  (IWC) 
moratorium on commercial whaling, there are thousands of whales killed each year 
and their meat ends up being sold in markets in Japan, Iceland and Norway. I will 
work  to  see  that  the  scientific  whaling  loophole,  and  others  like  it  that  allow  com-
mercial whaling to continue, are closed. 

Question  5a.  Do  you  believe  an  essential  role  for  the  United  States  is  to  ensure 

whale conservation becomes and remains the IWC’s focus? 

Answer. Yes. I believe that the IWC must re-focus itself on conservation and deal-
ing  with  the  many  threats  to  whales  that  exist  today—including  climate  change, 
marine pollution, and ocean noise. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK BEGICH TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  Some  62  percent  of  the  Nation’s  seafood  is  landed  in  Alaska,  none  of 
its  fish  stocks  are  considered  overfished  and  wide  areas  of  ocean  have  been 
proactively closed to fishing to protect subsea habitat. As managed by the North Pa-
cific Fishery Management Council, Alaska is generally considered to have one of the 
best managed fisheries in the world yet some have proposed changes in the regional 
fishery management council structure to address overfishing and other issues appar-
ent  elsewhere  in  the  Nation.  What  changes  do  you  propose  in  the  regional  council 
process and how might that affect the regulatory process in Alaska? 

Answer.  I  wish  to  commend  the  North  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council  for 
its  recent  decision  to  study  fishing  in  the  Arctic  before  beginning  to  permit  fishing 
at  industrial  levels.  I  applaud  their  taking  the  long-term  view.  I  do  not  currently 
envision changing the council process. 

Question  2.  Catch  share  systems  have  been  proposed  as  a  way  to  advance  con-
servation,  safety  and  market-focused  fishery  management  goals.  Many  Alaska  fish-
eries—pollock,  halibut  and  crab—already  operate  under  such  systems.  Critics  have 
criticized  privatizing  a  public  resource.  Do  you  support  implementation  of  catch- 
share programs? 

Answer.  Yes.  Recent  scientific  studies—and  the  performance  of  many  of  Alaska’s 
fisheries—show  that  those  fisheries  operated  with  catch  share  management  have 
better  environmental  and  economic  records  than  other  fisheries  managed  without 
them.  On  the  topic  of  privatization,  fisheries  are  a  public  trust  resource,  meaning 
they  belong  to  all  Americans.  The  law  and  court  decisions  make  it  clear  that  catch 
shares  are  a  privilege  not  a  right.  They  do  not  change  the  fact  that  fisheries  are 
a public trust resource. Most management without catch shares has been proven to 
be  inadequate  to  meet  NOAA’s  public  trust  responsibilities.  One  of  the  best  ways 
to  ensure  the  public  will  benefit  from  healthy,  profitable  fisheries  into  the  future 
is to add catch shares to our management tool box. 

Question 2a. If so, would you support initial quota allocations that respect the his-

torical participation of crewmembers, as well as skippers and owners? 

Answer. Yes. Catch share systems are flexible and can accommodate share alloca-
tions to skippers, crew, communities, sectors, and others. I look forward to working 
with  the  Fishery  Management  Councils  on  a  wide  variety  of  catch  share  designs 
that will ensure we have healthy marine ecosystems and healthy fishing economies. 
Question  2b.  Given  the  variability  in  fisheries,  do  you  see  a  need  for  national 

standards for such programs? 

Answer. The Magnuson-Stevens Act has standards and guidelines to assist in the 
implementation of catch shares. I believe we need more expertise on these programs 
but one thing emerging from the research is that there is no one type of catch share 
program  that  works  for  every  fishery.  Catch  shares  designs  need  to  be  tailored  to 
the individual fishery and marine ecosystem.

Question  3.  Will  you  have  a  deputy  in  your  office  that  focuses  solely  on  oceans 

and fisheries issues? 

Answer. Yes, I intend to appoint an Assistant Secretary for Oceans. 
Question  4.  Alaska  coastal  communities  that  depend  on  ocean  resources  for  sub-
sistence,  commercial  and  recreational  uses  are  often  faced  with  critical  resource  re-
lated  issues.  The  Sea  Grant  program,  funded  in  part  by  NOAA,  works  to  bridge 
science  and  technological  information  with  coastal  residents  to  help  them  make  in-
formed  decisions.  In  Alaska  there  are  10  extension  agents  spread  throughout  the 
state. Nationally Sea Grant is affiliated with 32 top universities across the Atlantic, 
Pacific  and  Gulf  coasts  and  the  Great  Lakes  conducting  scientific  research,  edu-
cation,  training,  and  extension  projects  designed  to  foster  science-based  decisions 
about  the  use  and  conservation  of  our  aquatic  resources.  Regrettably,  Sea  Grant’s 
funding has stagnated over the last 6 years. 

As  NOAA  Administrator,  will  you  support  the  Sea  Grant  program  and  help  it  to 
grow  so  that,  as  these  big  issues  come  before  us—notably  climate  change  and  its 
impact  on  our  marine  resources,  our  coastal  residents  can  adapt  at  the  most  local 
of levels? 

Answer. Yes. I am a strong supporter of the Sea Grant program. 
Question  5.  Scientists  and  Alaska  coastal  communities  are  becoming  more  and 
more concerned about the effects of ocean acidification on our marine life. It is pre-
dicted that the average acidity of the oceans could triple by the end of this century, 
which  could  have  a  devastating  effect  on  marine  life.  How  should  the  Nation  best 
approach the issue of ocean acidification? 

Answer.  The  problem  of  ocean  acidification  is  quite  alarming.  The  most  obvious 

way we can address it is by reducing our carbon emissions. 

Question  6.  NOAA  currently  conducts  significant  research  in  Alaska.  Unfortu-
nately,  most  of  the  research  vessels  doing  Alaska  research  are  home-ported  outside 
of  the  state,  either  in  Oregon,  Washington  or  California.  Will  you  work  with  the 
Alaska  delegation  so  more  research  vessels  conducting  Alaska  research  are  based 
in Alaska? 

Answer.  I  am  not  yet  deeply  familiar  with  the  specific  issues  regarding  home 
porting  of  NOAA  research  vessels.  But  if  confirmed,  I  will  study  these  issues  and 
look forward to working with the Alaska delegation on this issue. 

Question 7. Icebreakers are a critical need in Arctic research and our Nation’s two 
polar-class  icebreakers,  operated  by  the  Coast  Guard,  are  more  than  30  years  old, 
far  beyond  their  service  lives.  A  recent  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report  con-
cluded  that  ‘‘U.S.  icebreaking  capability  is  at  risk  of  being  unable  to  support  na-
tional  interests  in  the  north  and  the  south.’’  Will  you  commit  to  supporting  re-in-
vestment in such infrastructure, critical to the conduct of scientific research? 

Answer. Yes. I believe these are critically important for our Nation. 
Question  8.  NOAA  is  responsible  for  mapping  and  surveying  our  coasts,  which  is 
critical data for marine transportation, resource development, environmental protec-
tion  and  recreation  but  some  critical  shortfalls  are  apparent  across  the  Nation  and 
in Alaska, especially due to Arctic warming and erosion. How will you address this 
survey shortfall and will you continue to use private contractors to assist in this ef-
fort? 

Answer. I will work to obtain the funding necessary for survey work, particularly 
in Alaska, where I understand there have been minimal surveys. This survey work 
is  critical  to  navigation  safety  there,  particularly  as  shipping  traffic  is  expected  to 
increase in the Arctic. 

Question  9.  NOAA  listed  beluga  whales  as  an  endangered  species  last  October. 
The  listing  means  any  Federal  agency  that  funds  or  authorizes  activities  that  may 
affect the whales in the area must first consult with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service  to  determine  the  potential  effects  on  the  whales.  This  ruling  could  affect 
fishing and oil and gas development in Cook Inlet, expansion of the Port of Anchor-
age,  a  vital  lifeline  for  most  Alaskans  and  the  U.S.  military  presence  there,  and 
could necessitate expensive modifications to Anchorage’s wastewater treatment facil-
ity,  which  the  EPA  has  determined  does  not  affect  belugas.  I  am  not  aware  of  any 
scientific  information  showing  that  either  of  these  activities  have  any  effect  on 
beluga populations. As NOAA Administrator, how will you deal with agencies regu-
lating these industries and activities as it relates to the beluga listing? Will you as-
sure Alaskans that all decisions will be based on the best available science? 

Answer. I will always work to ensure that the agency’s decisions are based on the 
best available scientific information. I pledge to look into this situation, recognizing 
that  the  listing  decision  is  already  made.  I  will  review  implementation  of  the  deci-
sion,  particularly  what  mitigation  measures  are  required  to  try  to  ensure  that

Anchorage and the surrounding areas.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BARBARA BOXER TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question 1. As a Commissioner for the Pew Oceans Commission and Joint Oceans 
Commission  Initiative,  you  worked  to  identify  priority  actions  for  addressing  the 
challenges  facing  our  oceans.  Some  of  the  recommendations  highlighted  by  these 
Commissions  included  the  need  for  a  national  ocean  policy  and  national  and  re-
gional  ocean  governance  reform.  What  role  do  you  see  for  NOAA  in  implementing 
these reforms, and what challenges does the agency face in doing so? 

Answer.  I  support  a  NOAA  organic  act.  As  a  member  of  the  Pew  and  the  Joint 
Ocean Commissions, I have studied this issue. This is another good idea whose time 
has come. Ocean issues will not get the attention and focus they deserve in the gov-
ernment without a NOAA organic act. Currently NOAA’s organization and authori-
ties are a patchwork quilt of overlapping jurisdictions with other agencies, that can 
hinder  efficient  decision-making  on  issues  concerning  the  ocean  and  its  resources. 
Question 2. As you know, the oceans play a tremendous role in controlling Earth’s 
climate and are being severely impacted by climate change. As the NOAA Adminis-
trator, how will you work with other agencies such as NASA and the EPA to provide 
the  tools  necessary  for  understanding  and  responding  to  climate  change?  What  do 
you see as some of the top priorities for NOAA, both in terms of research and man-
agement, on this issue? 

Answer.  I  believe  we  need  a  National  Climate  Service  to  meet  the  needs  of  our 
Nation  to  better  understand  climate  impacts  and  deliver  information  critical  to  ad-
aptation,  mitigation,  and  management  planning.  Climate  change  is  and  will  con-
tinue  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  challenges  facing  our  Nation.  Working  with 
many other agencies, including the EPA, Department of Interior, Department of En-
ergy  and  Department  of  Agriculture,  the  White  House,  NOAA  should  lead  a  Na-
tional  Climate  Service  based  on  its  existing  statutory  mandates  to  provide  climate 
information  and  services  and  experience  managing  end  to  end  climate  operations. 
NOAA can build upon its strong climate monitoring, research, and assessment capa-
bilities,  and  translate  climate  data  and  research  into  information  and  services  that 
address  the  needs  of  stakeholders  at  the  local,  state,  regional,  and  national  level. 
Question 3. The number of commercial and industrial uses in Federal waters has 
been  growing  and  will  likely  continue  to  grow  in  the  future.  Proposals  for  new  off-
shore  activities  such  as  oil,  gas,  and  renewable  energy  production,  aquaculture,  or 
military  exercises  have  often  been  controversial  due  to  their  potential  impacts  on 
marine  ecosystem  health  and  existing  uses  of  marine  resources.  For  some  of  these 
activities,  NOAA  is  not  the  lead  Federal  agency  of  jurisdiction.  As  Administrator, 
how  will  you  work  to  promote  NOAA’s  coordination  with  other  agencies  in  evalu-
ating  and  managing  these  activities?  Will  you  involve  states  in  decisions  about  the 
use of Federal waters off their coasts? 

Answer. NOAA should lead the Federal Government’s efforts to coordinate the de-
velopment  of  our  offshore  resources.  Our  nation  needs  an  integrated  ocean  plan  so 
that  we  can  ensure  the  most  efficient  and  environmentally  sound  development  and 
use of these important ocean resources. I believe states must be our partners in this 
endeavor.  I  will  use  NOAA’s  existing  authorities  to  accomplish  this  planning  and 
where appropriate permitting. 

Question  4.  When  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management 
Act was reauthorized in 2006, Congress reaffirmed its commitment to rebuild stocks 
in as short a time as possible, not to exceed 10 years in most cases. The reauthoriza-
tion  strengthened  existing  mandates  to  prevent  and  end  overfishing  through  a  sys-
tem of science-based catch limits and accountability measures. The National Marine 
Fisheries  Service  published  a  final  rule  on  January  16,  2009  containing  the  guide-
lines  necessary  to  implement  these  requirements.  Would  you  be  willing  to  provide 
some additional technical guidance and policy directives to avoid the misinterpreta-
tion of some potentially unclear provisions in the rule? Also, more broadly, how will 
you  ensure  that  the  proper  guidance  and  tools  are  in  place  to  end  overfishing  by 
2011 and rebuild depleted stocks in as short a time-frame as possible? 

Answer.  I  understand  the  concern  about  the  guidelines  but  I  have  not  reviewed 
them  in  detail  yet.  If  confirmed,  I  will  give  them  a  hard  look  and  look  forward  to 
working with you on implementation. It is important that this rule on setting catch 
limits  be  done  right.  If  it  is  not,  then  we  won’t  be  able  to  end  overfishing  by  2011.

Question 5. I am personally very interested in marine mammal conservation, par-
ticularly since over 1/3 of the world’s whale and dolphin species, including 6 threat-
ened  or  endangered  whale  species,  spend  part  of  the  year  in  California’s  waters. 
Since many of these species are highly migratory, their protection hinges on our col-
laboration  with  other  nations.  Two  issues  that  particularly  concern  me  right  now 
are  the  future  of  the  United  States’  dolphin-safe  tuna  label,  which  I  worked  along 
with  the  current  Vice  President  to  establish,  as  well  as  the  potential  resumption  of 
commercial whaling. What role do you see for NOAA in formulating a United States 
position on these issues and working with international governments and organiza-
tions to advance that position? 

Answer.  I  believe  NOAA  should  take  the  lead  in  formulating  U.S.  positions  on 
these important issues. I look forward to working with other governments and non- 
governmental organizations to ensure even greater protections for whales and other 
marine mammals and to promote seafood integrity and safety. 

Question  6.  As  a  widely  respected  research  scientist  who  has  worked  to  promote 
greater communication of science to policymakers, you obviously understand the im-
portance  of  scientific  integrity  and  transparency.  I  appreciate  your  affirmation  of 
this philosophy in your testimony. Under the Bush Administration, there were seri-
ous  concerns  about  political  suppression  and  manipulation  of  scientific  work  at 
agencies. As Administrator of NOAA, how will you work to promote scientific integ-
rity at NOAA and elevate the role of science in policy decisions regarding our oceans 
and atmosphere? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  unbiased  and  authoritative  science  is  the  bedrock  upon 
which sound environmental decisions are made. A resilient society and economy de-
pend  on  informed  decisions  regarding  environmental  challenges  and  resource  man-
agement issues. If confirmed, I will ensure that NOAA will provide the Nation with 
scientifically  rigorous,  unbiased  assessments  of  the  often  difficult  and  controversial 
environmental challenges and opportunities facing us. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question 1. As you know, salmon recovery is a shared effort of numerous entities 
at  many  levels.  For  example,  the  Washington  Department  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  is 
responsible  for  a  great  deal  of  scientific  monitoring  of  ESA-listed  stocks  in  the  Co-
lumbia River. While I’m sure that as a scientist you’re dedicated to ensuring NOAA 
uses  the  best  available  science  for  managing  these  stocks,  a  major  limiting  factor 
is the availability of the data and monitoring we need to understand them. How do 
you plan to address current shortfalls in our data and monitoring of ESA-listed Co-
lumbia River stocks (such as lower Columbia Coho)? What is NOAA’s role in ensur-
ing  that  data  collection  and  monitoring  is  increased  and  improved—particularly 
when  many  of  NOAA’s  partners  like  state  resource  agencies  are  faced  with  enor-
mous  budget  cuts?  Does  this  mean  NOAA  will  devote  the  resources  needed  to  fill 
in those gaps? 

Answer.  NOAA  cannot  do  its  job  without  sufficient  funding.  NOAA  needs  more 
funding  and  I  will  work  with  OMB  and  the  Congress  to  get  it.  NOAA’s  FY  2009 
budget  request  is  $4.1  billion.  NOAA’s  appropriation  has  been  flat  at  $3.9  billion 
since FY 2005, while its mandates and the demand for its services have grown. With 
sufficient  funding  I  believe  we  can  improve  the  agency’s  data  collection  and  moni-
toring. . 

Question  1a.  What  linkage  do  you  see  between  harvest  and  hatcheries?  Should 
salmon  and  steelhead  stocks  listed  for  protection  under  the  Endangered  Species 
Act—for  which  Northwest  ratepayers  are  paying  approximately  $900  million  a 
year—be  subject  to  such  robust  harvest  levels?  How  do  you  balance  these  two  re-
sponsibilities  to  achieve  recovery?  Since  NOAA  is  endorsing  many  of  the  proposed 
hatchery  reforms,  what  is  NOAA’s  role  in  helping  to  provide  the  resources  needed 
to actually make those reforms happen? 

Answer.  I  am  not  familiar  with  the  specific  issues  regarding  harvest  levels  and 
hatchery reforms in Washington, but if confirmed I will study this issue closely and 
look forward to working with you on a balanced approach. In general, I believe that 
the science does not dictate policy decisions but should inform them. 

Question  2.  Individual  quota  share  programs  have  been  implemented,  or  are  in 
development,  in  a  number  of  fisheries  important  to  Washington  state  fishers  and 
processors,  including  fisheries  for  Alaska  pollock,  Pacific  whiting,  Alaska  flatfish 
and  North  Pacific  crab.  What  is  your  view  on  Limited  Access  Privilege  Programs 
(LAPPs)?

78 

In  the  2006  Magnuson  Act  reauthorization  process,  many  cited  Federal  fisheries 
management  off  Alaska  as  a  model  for  management  of  U.S.  fisheries  and  proposed 
amendments to incorporate Alaska groundfish management requirements, including 
catch limits and catch accounting, into the Act. Do you agree that the North Pacific 
Council  has  a  good  record  in  managing  groundfish  stocks  and  do  you  support  the 
council process going forward? 

Answer. In general, I support catch share programs, but recognize the challenges 
of  design  and  implementation.  There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  solution  when  it  comes 
to  fisheries  management.  In  addition,  I  want  to  restate  my  support  for  the  recent 
decision  by  the  North  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council  to  study  fishing  in  the 
Arctic before beginning to permit fishing at industrial levels 

Question  2a.  Some  advocate  shutting  down  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries 
in some Federal waters using the Antiquities Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries 
Act,  a  new  Marine  Protected  Areas  regime,  a  national  network  of  Ocean  Heritage 
Areas,  and  other  processes.  What  is  your  view  on  using  these  processes  as  opposed 
to  continuing  to  use  the  regional  fishery  management  council  process  for  making 
policy decisions of this nature? 

Answer. I firmly believe that the designation and ongoing management of marine 
protected  areas  should  involve  a  highly  collaborative  public  process,  as  exemplified 
by  the  authority  provided  under  NOAA’s  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Act  and  the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. I feel strongly and will work to ensure that any marine na-
tional  monument—or  portion  thereof—for  which  NOAA  has  been  or  will  be  dele-
gated  management  responsibilities  should  have  the  same  protections,  management 
tools,  and  robust  public  involvement  that  are  available  for  national  marine  sanc-
tuaries. 

Question  3.  Are  you  acquainted  with  NOAA’s  efforts—through  a  formal  procure-
ment process—to find a new homeport for its Marine Operations Center-Pacific, now 
in Seattle? Will you affirm that the final decisionmaker in the procurement process 
for  relocating  MOC–P  will  afford  a  full  and  fair  opportunity  to  all  who  submit  an 
offer for a new location for the MOC–P? 

Answer. Absolutely, yes. 
Question 3a. I understand that the competitive process for deciding the new loca-
tion  for  the  MOC–P  will  be  decided  on  a  ‘‘best  value’’  basis.  While  that  is  a  good 
basis on which to make a final decision, it is somewhat subjective. Will you commit 
to having the definition of ‘‘best value’’ include a location’s comprehensive total cost 
to the government (not only for the real estate lease, but for cost of ship operations 
and costs borne by the NOAA workforce subject to this relocation)? 

Answer. I am not familiar with the specific issues regarding what constitutes the 
best  value  in  determining  the  home  port  of  a  fleet,  but  if  confirmed  I  will  study 
them and will work with you on this issue 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  Dr.  Lubchenco,  you  are  a  world-renowned  scientist  and  have  taken 
great strides toward integrating ecological systems and human health, the economy, 
social  justice  and  national  security  issues.  Given  NOAA’s  responsibility  to  balance 
resource  conservation  with  fisheries  regulations,  and  a  mandate  to  also  ensure  eco-
nomic  viability  where  possible,  how  will  you  seek  to  move  forward  with  an  inte-
grated approach to the implementation of Magnuson-Stevens? For example how will 
you  balance  the  multiple  interests  for  an  integrated  approach  to  management  in 
areas  such  as  turtle  protection,  marine  mammals,  and  depleted  stocks?  How  will 
novel  technology  or  non-traditional  elements  (such  as  local  knowledge  as  observa-
tion,  aquaculture  technology  advances,  or  on-the-ground  partnerships  with  non- 
NOAA entities) contribute to your overall integrated management plan? 

Answer. Throughout my teaching, leadership of large organizations, and participa-
tion in public service, I have emphasized the important role of clear scientific input 
in decisionmaking. I have stressed my belief that science should inform, not dictate, 
decision-making.  Decisions  should  be  based  on  a  range  of  factors  including  values, 
economics,  politics,  and  science.  In  other  words,  scientific  information  alone  should 
not  drive  decisions,  but  it  should  be  available  in  an  understandable,  relevant,  sa-
lient, and credible fashion so that it can be taken into consideration. Scientific infor-
mation should clearly articulate what is known and what is not known about a par-
ticular  topic,  and  with  what  degree  of  certainty.  It  should  describe  what  is  known 
about how systems work, how they are changing and the likely consequences of dif-
ferent  policy  choices.  Policy  decisions  on  marine  fisheries  and  endangered  species

79 

are made by government leaders who attempt to balance various concerns, but these 
decisions  should  be  informed  by  the  best  scientific  information  available,  in  con-
sultation with all interested parties. 

Question 2. In recent years, NOAA has moved toward a regional approach for pro-
viding products and services to the public. One key element of a successful regional 
effort  is  the  ability  to  provide  national  leadership  and  direction,  regional  priority 
setting,  and  the  ability  to  address  local  issues  of  need.  Will  you  plan  to  continue 
NOAA’s efforts in regionalization? If so, how will the regional concept be integrated 
with  other  on-the-ground  engagement  efforts,  including  communications,  education, 
extension and training? Given that Hawaii is unique in its geographic isolation and 
given  that  many  local  issues  are  in  fact  regional  issues  in  Hawaii,  how  might  Ha-
waii  move  forward  with  regionalization  in  a  manner  that  serves  as  an  example  for 
the agency? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  ecosystem-based  management  is  far  superior  to  managing 
ocean  resources  on  a  sector-by-sector  basis.  This  is  particularly  true  because  each 
geographic region is unique. I would like to see states and local governments work-
ing toward using this approach. NOAA should lead by example—NOAA should look 
at  its  own  management  decisions  on  a  more  ecosystem  basis  rather  than  by  sector 
or statute. I hope to implement greater regional governance within NOAA across its 
programs.  My  predecessor,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  began  the  difficult  process  of 
breaking  down  the  ‘‘silos’’  within  NOAA.  If  confirmed,  I  would  like  to  continue  and 
increase  those  efforts.  I  would  welcome  the  opportunity  to  work  with  you  on  this 
effort. 

Question 3. NOAA’s portfolio covers a diverse spectrum of responsibilities and as-
sets,  ranging  from  individual  on-the-ground  researchers  to  large-scale  satellite  ac-
quisition  and  operations.  Arguably,  NOAA’s  satellite  program  expenditure  is  on  a 
dramatically  different  scale  than  most  of  NOAA’s  other  programs.  As  you  seek  to 
ensure  that  NOAA’s  satellite  program  remains  on  track,  how  will  you  address  the 
issue of scale? What is your plan going forward to ensure that NOAA’s satellite pro-
gram  will  be  able  to  deliver  the  data  required  by  researchers  while  still  remaining 
cost-effective and efficient in its use of resources? 

Answer. The cost overruns and delays in the NOAA satellite program are a huge 
problem that impacts the entire agency. We must ensure that the cost overruns end 
so  that  other  programs  do  not  have  to  continue  to  shrink  in  order  to  pay  for  the 
satellite  program  at  NOAA.  I  will  make  this  a  priority.  Indeed  I  would  like  to  con-
vert  a  staff  level  political  appointee  position  at  NOAA  into  an  Assistant  Secretary 
position to oversee on a daily basis the weather and satellite programs. In addition, 
the  continuity  of  climate  data  is  critical  to  our  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  cli-
mate change in society, and will be a priority under my leadership given the policy 
efforts  this  data  will  support.  NOAA  must  have  an  additional  $74  million  included 
in  its  FY09  budget  to  develop  and  reinstall  key  climate  sensors  back  onto  the 
NPOESS  program.  The  continuation  of  this  funding  will  be  crucial  to  continuing 
this effort to ensure the future of the climate record. I believe this funding may have 
been  included  in  the  stimulus  legislation  recently  passed  by  Congress.  If  not,  I  will 
work with the Appropriations Committee to see that this funding is included in the 
2009 final spending bill. 

Question 4. My constituency and that of my colleagues in the House are small is-
land  arcs  in  the  Pacific.  Fish  and  sustainable  fishing  are  an  intimate  part  of  the 
culture of my region and help define us as Pacific Islanders. 

Fishing  methods  have  changed  over  the  centuries  but  it  is  important  that  Pacific 
Island fishing cultures be sustained and that the economic development of the indig-
enous people includes greater participation in sustainable fisheries. 

The importance of fishing to the region as a whole is exemplified by the attention 
devoted to fisheries in the Pacific Islands Regional Organizations, The Pacific Com-
munity  (22  independent  Pacific  Island  Nations  and  Territories)  and  the  Pacific 
Forum (14 independent Pacific Island Nations plus Australia and New Zealand). 

The  Pacific  Community’s  largest  program  is  fisheries  and  fisheries  development. 
The  Pacific  Forum  established  its  own  fishery  management  organization,  the 
Forum  Fisheries  Agency  to  ensure  that  Pacific  Islanders  obtain  the  maximum  ben-
efit from the fishery resources in their EEZs. 

Will  you  be  supportive  of  mechanisms  in  the  MSA  such  as  the  Alaska-Western 
Pacific  Community  Development  Programs,  which  are  intended  to  foster  greater 
participation and benefits from fishing for native peoples? 

Answer.  I  am  generally  supportive  of  the  rights  of  native  peoples  to  fish.  I  am 
not familiar with the specific programs you describe, but I look forward to learning 
more about them if confirmed.

Question  5.  As  a  legislator  I  am  aware  of  the  many  statutes  with  which  fisheries 

80 

managers must comply when developing fishery management measures. 

These  include  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act,  Na-
tional  Environmental  Policy  Act  and  Small  Business  Regulatory  Enforcement  Fair-
ness Act among many others, as well, of course, as the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 

U.S. fisheries are among some of the most stringently managed fisheries globally, 
and  a  major  benefit  of  this  management  has  been  a  steady  decline  in  the  number 
of stocks that are overfished and subject to overfishing. 

However,  U.S.  fishery  management  continues  to  be  undermined  by  misinforma-
tion  campaigns  which  distort  the  excellent  science  conducted  by  NOAA  Fisheries. 
A  recent  publication,  Ocean  Conservation  and  the  End  of  Overfishing,  mistakenly 
reports Hawaii’s bottomfish as being subject to overfishing, which is contrary to the 
2008 NOAA stock assessment. Second, this publication reports that decline of monk 
seals  in  Hawaii  is  due  to  overfishing  of  their  food  species,  which  is  contrary  to  the 
information  contained  in  the  NOAA  monk  seal  recovery  plan  and  at  odds  with  the 
deliberations of the monk seal recovery team. 

Can you please outline how you will defend NOAA’s fisheries science and the Re-
gional  Fishery  Management  Councils’  management  record  from  being  undermined 
by such campaigns? 

Answer.  I  am  not  familiar  with  the  situation  surrounding  Hawaii’s  groundfish  or 
the  monk  seal  recovery  plan  proposed  by  NOAA.  If  confirmed,  I  will  look  into  this 
issue.  In  general,  I  support  the  goal  of  ending  overfishing  but  I  also  recognize  this 
will be a difficult task and will require the cooperation and commitment of the fish-
ing  industry  to  rebuild  these  resources.  The  health  of  our  marine  fish  stocks  is  di-
rectly linked to the health of many coastal communities. I will work with the coun-
cils  and  all  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  overfishing  is  ended  by  the  statutory  dead-
line of 2010, based on the best science available, while carefully considering the eco-
nomic consequences of our actions. 

Question 6. As I’ve already noted, U.S. fisheries are among some of the most strin-
gently  managed  fisheries  globally.  However,  80–90  percent  of  all  seafood  consumed 
in  the  U.S.  is  imported  from  other  countries.  Many  of  these  countries  have  either 
little  to  no  sustainable  fishery  management,  or  fail  to  comply  by  their  own  or  even 
international  fishery  management  regimes.  In  my  own  region,  Spanish  and  Ecua-
dorian purse seiners have regularly made incursions into the U.S. EEZ in the West-
ern Pacific to fish for tuna. Also, there are already signs that other parts of the Pa-
cific  are  gearing  up  to  supply  the  Hawaii  market  with  bottomfish  after  the  2011 
shutdown  of  the  Northwestern  Hawaiian  Islands  bottomfish  fishery.  Please  explain 
how  you  will  work  to  level  the  playing  field  for  U.S.  fishermen  with  respect  to  im-
ports and import substitution? 

Answer.  It  is  not  fair  to  our  fishermen  to  hold  them  to  a  higher  standard  than 
we  are  willing  to  require  of  the  rest  of  world’s  fish  products  that  are  sold  in  the 
United States. 

It  is  imperative  that  we  work  internationally  to  end  the  overfishing  crisis  and 
soon.  If  confirmed,  I  will  take  hard  look  at  the  problem  of  how  to  stop  illegal  fish 
from  coming  into  the  U.S.  The  U.S.  must  be  very  tough  at  regional  fisheries  man-
agement organizations (RFMOs) and in other international fora on the nations that 
continue to break the rules and exploit loopholes in ocean governance systems. 

Question  7.  In  2007  NOAA  was  provided  $65  million  for  education  and  outreach. 
It  is  my  understanding  that  very  few  if  any  dollars  were  devoted  to  fisheries.  Of 
all  the  NOAA  line  offices,  fisheries  is  the  most  complex  because  it  affects  not  only 
marine ecosystems but also seafood safety, people’s jobs and management at domes-
tic  and  international  levels.  How  do  you  plan  to  provide  funding  to  NMFS  and  Re-
gional  Fishery  Management  Councils  for  fishery  education  and  outreach  to  engage 
the  public  in  supporting  fishery  management  and  understanding  the  diverse  and 
complex nature of the fishery management process? 

Answer.  NOAA  cannot  do  its  job  without  sufficient  funding.  NOAA  needs  more 
funding and I will work with OMB and Congress to get it. NOAA’s FY 2009 budget 
request  is  $4.1  billion.  NOAA’s  appropriation  has  been  flat  at  $3.9  billion  since  FY 
2005,  while  its  mandates  and  the  demand  for  its  services  have  grown.  With  suffi-
cient funding I believe we can improve our fishery management process. 

Question 8. Since the advent of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, in 1976, the Regional 
Fishery  Management  Council  appropriation  has  experienced  some  increase  for  new 
mandates  but  not  as  rapidly  as  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  budget.  For 
example,  in  the  decade  between  1996  and  2006,  the  Council’s  budget  increased  by 
50  percent  from  about  $10  million  to  $15  million,  while  over  the  same  time  period 
the NMFS budget jumped from $300 million to $800 million, or a rise of nearly 200 
percent.  Even  funding  for  the  National  Marine  Sanctuary  Program  (NMSP)  has

81 

risen  to  a  level  more  than  double  that  of  Regional  Fishery  Management  Councils. 
However,  Council  responsibilities  deal  directly  with  issues  such  as  jobs  for  fisher-
men and others in the seafood industry, the importance of sustainable food security 
and  the  need  to  minimize  carbon  footprints  through  fostering  local  fishing  indus-
tries.  The  2006  reauthorization  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  included  several  new 
mandates for the Regional Fishery Management Councils, including establishing an-
nual catch limits and accountability measures. The NOAA Planning, Programming, 
Budgeting and Execution System (PBBES) supports a base budget of about $30 mil-
lion  for  the  Regional  Fishery  Management  Councils.  How  will  you  ensure  that  the 
Regional  Fishery  Management  Councils  are  adequately  funded  to  meet  all  their  re-
sponsibilities under the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 2009, 2010 and beyond? 

Answer.  I  will  need  the  support  of  key  Members  of  Congress  to  obtain  additional 
funding for NOAA and look forward to working with you and your staff on this im-
portant  challenge.  NOAA  cannot  do  its  job  without  sufficient  funding.  NOAA  needs 
more  funding  and  I  will  work  with  OMB  and  Congress  to  get  it.  NOAA’s  FY  2009 
budget  request  is  $4.1  billion.  NOAA’s  appropriation  has  been  flat  at  $3.9  billion 
since FY 2005, while its mandates and the demand for its services have grown. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  Last  August,  this  Committee  held  a  hearing  on  our  Nation’s  failure 
to  invest  in  next-generation  climate  modeling  capability.  As  a  result,  we  are  falling 
behind  in  our  ability  to  predict  climate  impacts  at  the  regional  and  local  scale.  At 
that  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  the  need  for  an  integrated,  interagency  effort 
to  address  the  range  of  research,  software,  data  storage  and  computing  challenge 
associated  with  climate  modeling.  How  should  that  be  structured?  What  is  the  ap-
propriate role for NOAA? 

Answer.  I  believe  we  need  a  National  Climate  Service  to  meet  the  needs  of  our 
Nation  to  better  understand  climate  impacts  and  deliver  information  critical  to  ad-
aptation, mitigation, and management planning. Working with many other agencies, 
including the EPA, the White House, Department of Interior, Department of Energy 
and  Department  of  Agriculture,  NOAA  should  lead  a  National  Climate  Service 
based  on  its  existing  mandates  to  provide  climate  information  and  services  and  ex-
perience  managing  end  to  end  climate  operations.  NOAA  can  build  upon  its  strong 
climate  monitoring,  research,  and  assessment  capabilities,  and  translate  climate 
data  and  research  into  information  and  services  that  address  the  needs  of  stake-
holders at the local, state, regional, and national level. 

Question  2.  The  New  England  groundfishery  is  facing  unprecedented  challenges, 
as  it  looks  to  implement  a  sector-based  management  plan  in  2009.  Do  you  believe 
that  sector-based  management  will  provide  an  effective  mechanism  to  support  the 
rebuilding  goals  of  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  while  providing  a  lifeline  for  the  re-
gion’s fishermen? 

Answer.  I  believe  a  sector-based  approach  is  a  useful  idea  to  pursue,  particularly 
since the measures that have been used in the past have not served our dual goals 
of supporting both fishermen and the resources. 

Question  2a.  What  role  will  you  personally  take  in  implementing  sector-based 

management and ensuring the survival of the New England groundfishery? 

Answer. I will be personally engaged in this issue, along with a strong team I will 

recruit to NOAA. 

Question  3.  Illegal,  unreported  and  unregulated  fishing  poses  a  tremendous  chal-
lenge  for  the  sustainability  of  our  ocean  and  fisheries  resources.  The  absence  of 
sanction  measures  within  the  Regional  Fisheries  Management  Organizations 
(RFMOs)  appears  to  be  a  significant  challenge  in  enforcing  any  strong  fisheries 
management measures within those organizations. Do you agree that this is a prob-
lem?  Will  the  U.S.  propose  more  stringent  sanction  measures  within  the  RFMOs 
that it plays an active role in? 

Answer.  Illegal,  unreported  and  unregulated  fishing  is  a  terrible  problem,  as  is 
the  failure  of  IFMs  to  address  it  with  real  sanctions.  The  U.S.  must  be  very  tough 
at  the  International  Commission  for  the  Conservation  of  Atlantic  Tunas  (ICCAT) 
and in other international fora on the nations that continue to harvest species such 
as blue fin tuna at unsustainable levels. I believe that it is important to understand 
the science and use it to guide decision-making. Unfortunately, ICCAT has been ig-
noring the science and now the blue fin population is on the verge of collapse. I will 
work to change this if I am confirmed.

Question  4.  As  you  know,  the  International  Whaling  Commission  (IWC)  is  the 
body  charged  with  the  conservation  of  the  world’s  whales.  The  IWC  is  at  a  cross-
roads,  and  a  new  proposal  regarding  coastal  whaling  appears  to  support  partial  re-
sumption  of  commercial  whaling.  As  NOAA  Administrator,  will  you  seek  to 
strengthen  the  existing  commercial  whaling  moratorium?  Do  you  plan  to  serve  as 
the head of the U.S. delegation to the IWC? 

Answer.  Unfortunately,  despite  the  International  Whaling  Commission  (IWC) 
moratorium on commercial whaling, there are thousands of whales killed each year 
and their meat ends up being sold in markets in Japan, Iceland and Norway. I will 
work  to  see  that  the  scientific  whaling  loophole,  and  others  like  it  that  allow  com-
mercial whaling to continue, are closed. I have not made final decisions on the IWC 
after Dr. William Hogarth’s term expires later this year. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  Would  you  ever  recommend  using  the  Antiquities  Act  to  designate  a 

marine protected area? 

Answer.  Antiquities  Act  decisions  are  made  by  the  President.  He  ultimately  has 
the  discretion  to  use  this  authority  regardless  of  my  recommendation.  However,  I 
would  advise  the  President  that  he  consider  all  the  tools  at  his  disposal,  including 
the  NMSA  and  MSA.  I  would  also  strongly  recommend  that  decision-making  proc-
esses  be  open,  transparent  and  informed  by  science  as  I  have  discussed  in  earlier 
questions.  Further,  I  would  advise  where  there  are  many  constituencies  and  many 
concerns—for  instance  in  an  area  that  is  highly  utilized  by  recreational  and  com-
mercial  fishermen—the  President  should  ensure  that  there  is  substantial  consulta-
tion  with  user  groups  and  accommodations  of  their  concerns  regardless  of  the  au-
thority used to make the designation. 

Question 2. Are you aware of any current proposals, either in the Administration 
or  from  environmental  groups,  to  use  the  Antiquities  Act  to  declare  marine  monu-
ments  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico?  If  such  a  proposal  would  come  before  the  President, 
would you support or oppose such action? 

Answer. I an not aware of any proposals being considered by this Administration 
to  use  the  Antiquities  Act  to  declare  a  marine  monument.  If  such  a  proposal  were 
to arise, I would advise the President as described above. 

Question 3. What role do you feel an adjacent coastal State should have in deter-

mining the location and potential restrictions of a marine protected area? 

Answer.  As  recognized  in  many  statutes,  states  have  a  substantial  stake  in  deci-
sion-making  regarding  management  of  coastal  and  marine  resources.  I  believe  that 
states  and  the  Federal  Government  should  be  vital  partners  who  work  together  to 
restore  and  protect  our  coastal  and  marine  ecosystems  and  communities.  If  con-
firmed,  I  would  look  to  existing  partnerships  as  possible  models,  for  example  those 
in  California,  Rhode  Island,  and  Massachusetts.  These  partnerships  provide  dif-
ferent approaches to improving ocean management, including establishing protected 
areas,  in  state  waters.  Among  other  things.  I  believe  NOAA  should  provide  them 
any requested technical assistance in that process. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  To  understand  policies  and  priorities,  one  need  look  no  further  than 
the budget. I was pleased to see an increase in the previous administration’s budget 
request  for  FY  2009  putting  NOAA’s  overall  request  above  $4  billion  for  the  first 
time. But such increases have not been adequately represented across all of NOAA’s 
functions. In fact, absent an increase in funding for satellite programs, the 2009 re-
quest  was  a  flatline,  and  the  National  Ocean  Service  (NOS)  and  National  Marine 
Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  actually  experienced  a  decrease  of  nearly  $50  million 
each. It is in the process of allocating scarce funding resources that we truly reveal 
what  programs  we  want  to  carry  out  and  in  what  manner,  and  how  we  rank  the 
importance of various programs. That is why, Dr. Lubchenco, I want to understand 
how you are preparing to provide leadership in NOAA’s budget process. 

What  is  your  opinion  of  the  adequacy  of  NOAA  funding  under  the  8  years  of  the 
Bush Administration? While you have yet to put your mark on the FY10 budget re-
quest,  what  is  your  plan  for  working  with  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
to make sure that these other non-satellite programs—fisheries, endangered species

research,  ocean  science,  marine  mammals,  and  so  on—receive  the  appropriate  level 
of funding? 

Answer.  Both  Republicans  and  Democrats  in  Congress  have  told  me,  and  I  agree 
that NOAA needs more funding for FY10 and beyond if confirmed, I will work with 
OMB  and  the  Congress  to  get  it.  The  additional  funding  for  NOAA  in  the  stimulus 
package  will  help  with  funding  satellites  that  have  been  eating  away  at  resources 
for other programs within NOAA. As you noted, NOAA’s appropriation has been flat 
at  $3.9  billion  since  FY  2005,  while  its  mandates  and  the  demand  for  its  services 
have  grown.  I  will  also  work  to  ensure  that  going  forward  NOAA’s  budget  process 
is  robust,  forward-looking.  and  adequately  accounts  for  the  Nation’s  needs  for  oce-
anic and atmospheric information and services. 

Question  2.  As  NOAA  Administrator,  you  will  be  responsible  for  the  Bush-estab-
lished  Climate  Change  Science  Program  Office—the  CCSP—that  has  all  but  sub-
sumed the U.S. Global Change Research Program—the GCRP—that Congress estab-
lished  under  law  in  1990.  In  reality,  the  research  office  has  lacked  any  high  level 
Agency attention for at least the last 4 years. Understanding the science of climate 
change  is  critical  in  developing  a  response  to  the  massive  problem  as  well  as  dis-
seminating the data and information to develop momentum for major changes in en-
ergy and environmental policy as the U.S. Congress begins to debate climate change 
legislation this year and the U.S. negotiates an international climate change treaty. 
How do you believe NOAA should be updating or restructuring its policies for its 
Federal research program office for research and distribution of climate change data 
so  it  can  be  utilized  by  other  Administration  officials,  Congress,  and  regional  and 
local policymakers and stakeholders? 

Answer.  I  believe  we  need  a  National  Climate  Service  to  meet  the  needs  of  our 
Nation  to  better  understand  climate  impacts  and  deliver  information  critical  to  ad-
aptation, mitigation, and management planning. Working with many other agencies, 
including the EPA, Department of Interior, Department of Energy and Department 
of  Agriculture,  NOAA  should  lead  a  National  Climate  Service  based  on  its  existing 
statutory  mandate  to  provide  climate  information  and  services.  NOAA  can  build 
upon  its  strong  climate  monitoring,  research,  and  assessment  capabilities,  and 
translate  climate  data  and  research  into  information  and  services  that  address  the 
needs of stakeholders at the local, state, regional, and national level. 

Question  3.  Dr.  Lubchenco,  as  you  and  I  discussed  in  depth  at  the  hearing,  we 
must find ways to improve the relationship between NMFS and New England’s fish-
ermen. As long as this contentious relationship continues, it will undermine any at-
tempts  to  move  forward  with  credibility  and  cooperation.  I  truly  appreciate  your 
commitment  to  improving  the  ‘‘climate  of  trust’’  in  the  region,  and  I  hope  to  work 
with you closely to achieve this. 

Are  you  willing  to  commit  to  closely  examining  the  culture  and  attitudes  perva-
sive  in  the  Northeast  Regional  Office  and  its  leadership,  and  report  back  to  me  on 
the changes you make to improve the way it interacts with fishermen? 

Answer. To improve the relationship between the Agency and the fishing industry 
and fishing dependent communities, it would be beneficial for NMFS to increase its 
social science capabilities. This would enable the Agency to understand the impacts 
of  regulations  prior  to  their  implementation  and  plan  accordingly  to  mitigate  the 
negative  effects.  In  addition,  this  would  go  a  long  way  in  building  more  productive 
relationships  between  the  Agency  and  communities.  However,  in  order  to  increase 
social science capabilities, NMFS will need to hire many additional individuals with 
this type of expertise. 

Question  3a.  Can  you  commit  to  putting  a  greater  emphasis  on  NMFS  socio-eco-
nomic funding, research, and assessment, so that you have a greater understanding 
of  the  attitudes  and  behaviors  of  fishing  community  members  that  NMFS  is  trying 
to regulate? 

In your response to a pre-hearing question from one of my colleagues on the Com-
mittee,  you  answered  that  you  believed  being  asked  to  choose  between  protecting 
the  environment  and  expanding  the  economy  was  a  ‘‘false  choice’’  and  that  both 
could  and  should  be  accomplished  simultaneously.  I  happen  to  agree  with  that  as-
sessment, so I would ask you: 

Do you believe that ‘‘false choice’’ also applies to the manner in which we manage 
our  fisheries?  Can  we  balance  concerns  for  the  long-term  health  of  the  fish  stocks 
with the short term health of our fishing communities? 

The  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  mandates  that  NMFS  minimize  the  socioeconomic 
ramifications  of  its  fishery  management  plans  on  our  communities  while  achieving 
optimum  yield  from  the  fishery.  Do  you  feel  that  balance  is  being  achieved  today? 
Answer.  Yes.  I  am  fully  committed  to  improving  the  relationship  between  NOAA 
and  fishermen  all  over  the  country,  including  in  New  England.  I  will  personally

work  to  improve  the  trust  between  the  agency  and  fishermen,  and  look  forward  to 
regularly reporting back to you on the changes we are making. In addition, I intend 
to  hire  a  senior  advisor,  who  will  report  directly  to  me,  whose  entire  responsibility 
will  be  to  conduct  outreach  to  commercial  and  recreational  fishermen  and  fishing 
communities.  I  will  also  commit  to  putting  greater  emphasis  on  understanding  the 
perspectives  of  fishermen  and  fishing  communities  and  the  socio-economic  dimen-
sions of the regulations imposed by the agency. If confirmed, I look forward to work-
ing with you on this effort. We must work together to help solve these difficult prob-
lems.  The  viability  of  our  fisheries  depends  upon  healthy  fish  populations  and 
healthy oceans. We must find a way to achieve long term sustainability for our fish-
eries  in  New  England  and  elsewhere.  Fishing  is  an  important  way  of  life  and  an 
integral part of our coastal heritage and culture. 

Question  4.  As  a  world-class  scientist,  Dr.  Lubchenco,  you  have  been  at  the  fore-
front  of  scientific  advancement  and  you  understand  the  importance  of  data  collec-
tion, data management, and data interpretation—and the need to ensure objectivity 
and  integrity  throughout  the  scientific  process.  But  so  often  in  fisheries  manage-
ment,  NMFS  lacks  the  stock  assessment  funds  and  resources  that  are  necessary  to 
gather enough data to support quality and timely analyses. As a result, our Council 
members  are  forced  to  make  management  recommendations  based  on  incomplete 
data,  different  conclusions  from  competing  models,  and—as  a  result—a  significant 
range of scientific uncertainty. And now the stakes are higher, because the Magnu-
son-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 mandates science-based catch limits. 

What  is  your  philosophy  about  making  policy  and  management  decisions  in  the 

face of scientific uncertainty? 

Given  the  fact  that  there  will  always  be  some  degree  of  scientific  uncertainty  in 
fisheries management, would you direct NMFS to follow a strict precautionary prin-
ciple that sets stronger fishing limits until there is proof that stocks can withstand 
more  fishing?  If  so,  how  do  you  know  when  you  have  enough  evidence  to  serve  as 
this proof, and who would shoulder the burden of proof? 

Are there alternatives to the precautionary principle that you would support, such 
as  adaptive  management,  that  would  allow  managers  to  strike  a  balance  between 
harvesting and resource conservation? 

Answer.  My  philosophy  as  a  policymaker  is  to  make  the  best  decisions  possible 
in  the  face  of  scientific  uncertainty.  As  a  principle,  it  is  better  to  he  precautionary, 
but  policymakers  must  also  be  practical.  Ultimately,  I  will  be  guided  by  the  law, 
and the Magnuson Act Amendments mandate an end to overfishing by 2011. If con-
firmed,  I  pledge  to  work  with  you  and  to  never  surprise  you  with  a  decision  that 
negatively impacts fishermen in your state. 

Question 5. Not only does NMFS need to collect more data, but they need to help 
make  this  information  accessible  and  credible  in  the  eyes  of  fishermen.  Dr. 
Lubchenco, you and I discussed how cooperative research can help to bridge this gap 
between  the  industry  and  scientists.  But  the  fact  is,  various  forms  cooperative  re-
search has been around for at least a decade, and it has been occurring at the same 
time  that  trust  between  scientists  and  fishermen  has  evaporated.  This  may  have 
something  to  do  with  a  45  percent  decrease  in  funding  from  $18  million  in  2007— 
already  pitifully  low  given  that  national  landings  value  in  our  fisheries  is  over  $4 
billion annually—to just over $10 million in 2008. 

Since  traditional  cooperative  research  has  had  limited  and  mixed  success  in  im-
proving  the  scientist-fisherman  relationship,  how  would  you  propose  improving  the 
way cooperative research is done in the Northeast and throughout the Nation? 

What  steps  would  you  take  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  cooperative  research, 
and ensure that it is actually used in making and improving management decisions? 
Answer.  In  my  own  experience  I  have  seen  cooperative  research  programs  work 
very  effectively  on  the  West  Coast.  I  have  not  studied  in  depth  the  problems  with 
them in the Northeast region, but if confirmed, I pledge to do so. I will use my expe-
rience  to  evaluate  what  has  worked  and  what  has  not  with  these  cooperative  re-
search programs, and report back to you. 

Question  6.  As  you  become  more  familiar  with  the  New  England  groundfishery, 
I’m  sure  you’ll  learn  about  its  history  with  management  based  on  allocating  days- 
at-sea  and  the  steps  the  Council  is  taking  to  shift  to  sector-based  management— 
a management method allowing fishermen more control through self-selecting, coop-
erative  organizations.  Completing  this  transition  may  not  be  possible,  however,  if 
NMFS’s  proposed  interim  rules  are  allowed  to  proceed.  By  slashing  days-atsea  by 
sixty  percent  in  many  cases  leaving  fishermen  with  just  20  days  to  go  fishing, 
NMFS’s  rules  would  bankrupt  the  industry—including  infrastructure,  shoreside 
support, and seafood industries—and this change could be irreversible, especially in 
Maine where so many fishermen have already left.

Dr.  Lubchenco,  I  understand  that  NMFS’s  interim  proposed  rules  are  a  product 
of the Bush Administration, so you cannot speak to their formation. But under your 
leadership, what direction would you give NMFS for guiding its work in developing 
the final groundfishing rule? 

Specifically, would you direct them to use direction, already in the Magnuson-Ste-
vens  Act  and  regulatory  guidelines,  for  appropriately  considering  and  weighing  the 
social and economic impacts of these rules? 

Would you direct NMFS to use the flexibility it has under the MSA which specifi-
cally  allows  temporary  interim  rules  to  allow  limited  overfishing  on  a  limited 
bases—in  combination  with  accountability  measures—so  other  management  objec-
tives could be achieved in future years? 

Can  you  commit  to  giving  more  consideration  to  approving  the  interim  rules  pro-
posed—and  overwhelmingly  approved  twice  by  the  Council—that  would  allow  more 
fishing  but  still  mandate  accountability  measures  for  overfishing  and  meet  other 
legal requirements? 

Answer. I understand that the New England groundfish rules have been an ongo-
ing  controversy,  most  recently  in  the  courts  and  also  in  the  New  England  Fishery 
Management Council. If confirmed, I will review the proposed interim final rule and 
ensure it fully complies with all the provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, includ-
ing the requirement to weigh the social and economic impacts of these rules. 

Question  7.  The  concept  of  ecosystem  management  has,  as  you  know  better  than 
any  of  us,  been  around  for  decades.  I  agree  that  fisheries  management  should  con-
sider  and  incorporate  diverse  information  inputs  and  explore  new  models  to  under-
stand and explain ecosystem function. Beyond these basic ideas, however, the defini-
tion of ‘‘ecosystem management’’ is still unresolved in the academic community. Sev-
eral  groups,  including  your  Pew  Ocean  Commission,  have  advocated  for  ecosystem 
management of fisheries, and I’m curious to learn where you stand on this as a pil-
lar of fisheries policy. 

What  is  your  definition  of  ‘‘ecosystem  management’’  today  and  how  would  you 

apply this to marine fisheries? 

Do you think that there is consensus across the academic, industry, and environ-
mental  communities  about  what  ecosystem  management  is  and  how  it  is  carried 
out? 

Do  you  think  that  fisheries  ecosystem  management  should  be  mandated  by  law, 
or do you think NOAA has sufficient authority to move in this direction now, as evo-
lution  of  the  field  permits?  If  you  do  not  think  NOAA  has  the  authority  to  incor-
porate  more  ecosystem  information  in  management  as  it  becomes  available,  exactly 
what is preventing this? 

Answer.  I  believe  strongly  in  the  use  of  ecosystem-based  management,  and  there 
is  growing  consensus  on  its  use.  Ecosystem-based  management  is  far  superior  to 
managing ocean resources on a sector-by-sector basis and I would like to see states 
and  local  governments  work  toward  using  this  approach.  I  believe  NOAA  should 
lead  by  example—NOAA  should  look  at  its  own  management  decisions  on  a  more 
ecosystem  basis  rather  than  by  sector  or  statute.  I  hope  to  implement  greater  re-
gional  governance  within  NOAA  across  its  programs.  My  predecessor,  Admiral 
Lautenbacher, began the difficult process of breaking down the ‘‘silos’’ within NOAA. 
If confirmed, I would like to continue and increase those efforts. 

Question 8. The economic impacts of endangered species listing can exacerbate an 
already  fragile  economy.  Clearly,  we  must  protect  our  endangered  species  and  live 
up to the intent of the landmark Endangered Species Act, at the same time I think 
we  can  all  agree  that  it  is  incumbent  on  Federal  agencies  that  they  provide  the  re-
sources  to  implement  the  species  recovery  plans.  In  my  home  state  of  Maine,  how-
ever, we have failed to receive even a modest amount of funding to restore our salm-
on  fisheries,  while  massive  amounts  of  resources  are  dedicated  on  the  West  Coast. 
Clearly, there needs to be a comprehensive plan to restore the salmon fisheries, and 
the  State  of  Maine  has  worked  tirelessly  to  coordinate  with  the  Federal  agencies. 
At  the  same  time,  bureaucracy  has  prevented  the  Federal  Government  from  effec-
tively and efficiently working with the State of Maine to develop a recovery strategy. 
One major cause of this failure on the part of the Federal Government is that both 
the Interior Department and NOAA jointly implement ESA issues involving Atlantic 
salmon, while on the Pacific coast, NOAA is the clear lead authority. While I strong-
ly  believe  that  the  Interior  Department  should  be  a  partner  in  recovery  efforts, 
NOAA’s  expertise  in  both  ocean  and  river  ecosystems,  should  be  the  lead  agency. 
Do  you  believe  that  NOAA  should  be  the  lead  agency  in  implementing  recovery 
of  the  Atlantic  salmon?  Do  you  believe  that  current  Federal  resources  dedicated  to 
species recovery are sufficient to develop sustainable populations?

Answer. I am not yet familiar with the specific issues regarding recovery of Atlan-
tic  salmon  in  Maine,  and  the  interagency  jurisdictional  issues  involved.  But  if  con-
firmed  I  will  study  these  issues  and  will  answer  your  questions  regarding  them.  I 
will  also  work  with  you  to  obtain  additional  funding  for  recovery  efforts  because  in 
my experience these are generally underfunded. 

Question  9.  International  Conservation  and  Trade  Sanctions:  Sections  609  and 
610  of  the  High  Seas  Driftnet  Fishing  Moratorium  Protection  Act—which  were 
added  as  part  of  our  last  Magnuson  Reauthorization—provide  your  agency  with  an 
extraordinary  new  set  of  powerful  tools  to  combat  IUU  fishing  and  to  improve  pro-
tected  species  conservation  through  bycatch  reduction.  In  particular,  as  we  have 
learned  through  the  painful  failures  of  ICCAT  to  conserve  bluefin  tuna—the  use  of 
trade  sanctions  to  control  the  market  for  fish  harvested  illegally  appears  to  be  the 
only  effective  tool  left  to  prevent  the  wholesale  destruction  of  some  international 
fisheries.  Similarly,  the  blatant  disregard  for  bycatch  conservation  in  foreign  fish-
eries  such  as  the  failure  to  use  circle  hooks  and  other  proven  techniques  in  their 
pelagic  longline  fisheries  completely  undermine  very  comprehensive  U.S.  efforts  to 
protect  bycatch  species  such  as  sea  turtles  developed  in  close  cooperation  with  our 
own swordfish and tuna longline fisheries. Will you aggressively implement and en-
force these provisions? What are the consequences if you don’t? 

Answer.  It  is  not  fair  to  our  fishermen  to  hold  them  to  a  higher  standard  than 
we  are  willing  to  require  of  the  rest  of  world’s  fish  products  that  are  sold  in  the 
United  States.  At  the  same  time  the  U.S.  has  an  important  leadership  role  to  play 
by  setting  the  best  possible  example  for  the  rest  of  the  world.  It  is  imperative  that 
we  work  internationally  to  end  the  overfishing  crisis  and  soon.  If  confirmed,  I  will 
take  hard  look  at  the  problem  of  how  to  stop  illegal  fish  from  coming  into  the  U.S. 
The  U.S.  must  be  very  tough  at  regional  fisheries  management  organizations 
(RFMOs)  and  in  other  international  fora  on  the  nations  that  continue  to  break  the 
rules and exploit loopholes in ocean governance systems. If confirmed, I will aggres-
sively  implement  and  enforce  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act 
and the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Act. 

Question 10. A similar provision lies in the Marine Mammal Protection Act which 
requires  other  nations  to  achieve  the  same  standards  of  marine  mammal  bycatch 
protection  as  are  required  in  U.S.  fisheries  in  order  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  selling 
their  fish  on  the  U.S.  market.  (MMPA  section  101(a)(2)  16  U.S.C.  1371(a)(2)).  Al-
though  Congress  clearly  intended  that  the  failure  to  achieve  U.S.  standards  would 
result  in  a  trade  sanction,  it  appears  your  agency  and  others  have  never  imple-
mented this provision of law. The Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition al-
most  a  year  ago  (March  4,  2008)  asking  the  Departments  of  Commerce,  Treasury 
and Homeland Security to ban imports of swordfish from countries that have failed 
to  submit  proof  that  they  have  met  the  U.S.  standards  as  required  by  law.  Do  you 
support aggressive implementation of this authority? 

I  understand  a  proposed  rule  has  been  issued  to  seek  comments  on  this  petition, 
but given the extraordinary delay in responding so far—what do you envision is the 
time-frame for implementing this law? Are there other fisheries than swordfish that 
should be addressed as well? 

Answer.  I  am  not  yet,  familiar  with  the  specific  issues  regarding  trade  sanctions 
in fisheries, and would look to my colleagues in the Administration for their exper-
tise  in  these  issues.  In  general.  I  support  the  use  of  all  available  tools  to  stop  the 
unfair trade in illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing for swordfish, tunas and 
other pelagic species. If confirmed, I would move quickly to make progress on these 
issues. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHNNY ISAKSON TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question 1. Describe your expectation of how sound science should inform marine 

and endangered species issues. 

Answer. Throughout my teaching, leadership of large organizations, and participa-
tion in public service, I have emphasized the important role of clear scientific input 
in decisionmaking. I have stressed my belief that science should inform, not dictate, 
decision-making.  Decisions  should  be  based  on  a  range  of  factors  including  values, 
economics,  politics,  and  science.  In  other  words,  scientific  information  alone  should 
not  drive  decisions,  but  it  should  be  available  in  an  understandable,  relevant,  sa-
lient, and credible fashion so that it can be taken into consideration. Scientific infor-
mation should clearly articulate what is known and what is not known about a par-
ticular  topic,  and  with  what  degree  of  certainty.  It  should  describe  what  is  known

about how systems work, how they are changing and the likely consequences of dif-
ferent policy choices. 

Policy  decisions  on  marine  fisheries  and  endangered  species  are  made  by  govern-
ment  leaders,  and  should  be  informed  by  the  best  scientific  information  available, 
in consultation with all interested parties. 

Question 2. NOAA Marine Fisheries recently declared that flow reductions in the 
drought-stricken  Savannah  River  would  be  adverse  to  the  endangered  Short  Nose 
Sturgeon.  Yet  no  science-based  analysis  was  conducted  to  justify  this  adverse  find-
ing,  and  neither  I  nor  my  staff  has  been  given  any  data  by  NOAA  to  support  the 
decision. Given your view on the use of science in policymaking and regulation (see 
above), was the adverse finding appropriate? 

Answer.  I  am  not  familiar  with  the  NOAA  decision  regarding  the  Short  Nose 
Sturgeon.  If  confirmed,  I  will  immediately  look  into  this  issue  and  provide  an  an-
swer. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

DR. JANE LUBCHENCO 

Question  1.  Recreational  fishermen  and  conservationists  were  pleased  on  Sep-
tember  26,  2008  when  President  Bush  signed  an  amendment  to  Executive  Order 
#13474. It stated that ‘‘recreational fishing shall be managed as a sustainable activ-
ity  in  national  wildlife  refuges,  national  parks,  national  monuments,  national  ma-
rine sanctuaries, marine protected areas, or any other relevant conservation or man-
agement area or activities made under any Federal authority, consistent with appli-
cable  law.’’  Do  you  plan  to  ask  the  new  Administration  to  uphold  this  EO  or  will 
you move to repeal it? 

Answer. If confirmed, I do not intend to seek changes to this Executive Order. 
Question 2. In establishing any Marine Protected Area (MPA), the Magnuson Act 
requires: (1) an open, public process that is based on the best scientific information 
available; (2) criteria to assess the conservation benefits of the closed area; (3) estab-
lishment of a timetable for review of the closed area’s performance that is consistent 
with  the  purposes  of  the  closed  area,  and  (4)  that  it  be  based  on  an  assessment  of 
the benefits and impacts of the closure. Do you plan to follow the statutes? 

Answer. Absolutely. 
Question  3.  President-Elect  Obama  stated  in  the  October  2008  edition  of  Sport 
Fishing  magazine  that  ‘‘The  decision  to  establish  marine  reserves  should  be  made 
as  a  result  of  a  transparent,  science-based  process  and  be  the  least  intrusive  pos-
sible  to  get  the  job  done.’’  Given  your  advocacy  in  favor  of  No  Fishing  Zones,  will 
you support the President-Elect’s position as outlined in his interview? 

Answer. Yes. 
Question 4. What is the largest number of people you have ever actually been re-

sponsible for? What was that role and what kind/level of staff were you leading? 

Answer.  I  have  led  numerous  large,  complex  projects  and  organizations  and 
served  on  Boards  of  Directors  for  major  foundations,  governmental  organizations 
and  non-governmental  organizations.  These  projects,  organizations  and  boards  and

direction, policy and management of the organization. 

In my more than thirty-year career as a scientist, simultaneously managing mul-
tiple ongoing research projects, and other scientific, academic, and policy endeavors, 
I  have  gained  a  wealth  of  experience  in  running  an  enterprise.  I  understand  first-
hand  how  to  manage  budgets,  build  a  management  team,  maximize  human  re-
sources, do strategic planning and solve problems to deliver tangible results. 

Question  5.  I’d  like  to  know  if  there  are  any  efforts  being  made  on  finding  ways 
to  accurately  predict  fog  and  confirm  its  density/duration/extent,  particularly  on 
shipping channels leading to major ports. Is there any infrared or other commercial 
vision  technology  available  that  can  see  through  fog  accurately  and  enable  ships, 
aircraft  and  vehicles  to  move  safely?  This  is  one  area  where  marine  technology  is 
lagging  and  causing  long,  unexpected  delays  for  marine  and  other  transportation 
services, especially in winter months. 

Answer.  I  do  not  know  if  NOAA  is  conducting  research  on  fog  prediction.  If  con-
firmed, I will look into your question immediately and provide you with an answer. 
Ensuring  maritime  safety  is  a  very  important  part  of  NOAA’s  mission—it  is  a  re-
sponsibility I take very seriously. 

Question  6.  What  is  your  opinion  of  Congressman  Oberstar’s  ‘Clean  Water  Res-
toration Act’ and making every stream, pond or puddle subject to Federal regulation 
under the Clean Water Act? 

Answer. I have not studied Congressman Oberstar’s proposal. If confirmed, I will. 
But  since  NOAA  does  not  have  authority  to  act  under  the  Clean  Water  Act,  I  will 
defer  to  my  colleagues  in  other  agencies  for  their  interpretation  of  this  legislation. 
Question  7.  If  you  have  a  choice  between  protecting  the  environment  and  in  turn 
shrinking  the  economy  or  expanding  the  economy  and  improving  the  environment 
as technologies advance, which would you choose as the appropriate policy decision? 
Answer.  I  do  not  believe  that  protecting  the  environment  shrinks  the  economy— 
in  my  view  this  is  a  false  choice.  Our  environment  is  better  managed  than  it  was 
in  the  early  1970s  when  the  country  first  started  passing  modern  environmental 
protection laws. Yet this environmental protection has not caused economic collapse. 
In  fact,  our  economy  has  increased  in  size  nearly  10  times  over  that  period.  In  my 
years  of  research  and  study,  I  have  found  that  the  failure  to  protect  the  environ-
ment  and  our  precious  natural  resources  is  far  more  expensive  to  society  and  the 
economy  in  the  long  run,  than  the  immediate  costs  associated  with  environmental 
protection.  Any  short-run  costs  to  protect  the  environment  generally  result  in 
human  health  benefits  as  well  as  a  sustainable  economy  that  will  provide  jobs  and 
profits not just today but for our children and their children. The key for the govern-
ment is to create incentives to ensure that technology improvements keep pace with 
overall economic growth, and to invest in cutting edge science and technology. 

Question  8.  The  state  of  California  has  proven  what  a  disaster  cap-and-trade  can 
be  for  an  economy.  California  moved  forward,  despite  an  economic  downturn,  on  a 
cap-and-trade  program  that  was  justified  by  issuing  what  almost  all  experts  agree 
was  a  rigged  study  on  the  economic  impact  of  the  cap-and-trade  system.  When  the

California Air Resources Board (CARB) asked five independent economists to do an 
analysis of the regulations and the study, Harvard’s Robert Stavins, chairman of the 
Federal Environmental Protection Agency’s economic advisory committee under Bill 
Clinton,  stated  that  ‘‘None  of  us  knew  who  the  other  reviewers  were,  but  we  all 
came up with almost the same conclusion. The report was severely flawed and sys-
tematically  underestimated  costs.’’  These  ‘‘underestimations’’  have  been  a  disaster 
for  the  state  of  California  forcing  the  state  to  shed  more  jobs  than  any  other  since 
2007. The fact is that climate change legislation will be expensive and energy inten-
sive  industries  will  move  overseas.  What  can  we  do  to  prevent  what  has  happened 
in  California  from  happening  to  the  rest  of  the  country?  In  addition,  what  can  we 
learn from the California debacle? 

Answer.  I  have  not  studied  the  California  situation  you  describe.  It  is  my  under-
standing  that  California’s  cap-and-trade  policies  will  not  go  into  effect  until  2012. 
However,  because  NOAA  does  not  have  authority  for  regulating  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  or  for  setting  energy  policy,  this  is  not  an  issue  for  which  I  would  have 
responsibility. NOAA’s role is to ensure that policymakers have the best possible sci-
entific understanding of the extent and impacts of climate change so that regulation 
and  policies  can  reflect  this  information.  If  l  am  confirmed,  I  would  work  hard  to 
discharge  this  responsibility  efficiently  and  effectively.  Some  of  the  impacts  of  cli-
mate  change  that  are  relevant  to  these  discussions  include  sea  level  rise,  changes 
in  air  and  water  temperature,  changing  patterns  of  drought  and  intense  precipita-
tion,  and  increasing  acidity  of  oceans.  NOAA  should  play  the  role  of  honest  broker 
in climate discussions by providing credible scientific data and analysis to assist pol-
icymakers in Congress, state and local governments, and the private sector in devel-
oping appropriate policies. 

Question 9. How does an increase in the cost of energy affect low-income families? 
Answer.  NOAA’s  mission  does  not  include  energy  policy  matters.  If  confirmed  I 
would look to Congress and my colleagues in the relevant agencies for this informa-
tion. NOAA does have a key role to play here in helping Americans across the socio- 
economic spectrum make cost-saving decisions about a wide variety of matters from 
weatherization to storm preparation by providing high quality weather and climate 
forecasting services 

Question  10.  What  kind  of  ‘‘flexible  mechanisms’’  for  industry  and  energy  pro-
ducers would you like to see available in future climate change legislation? In addi-
tion, serious concerns have been raised in regards to the loss of manufacturing jobs 
here  in  the  United  States  to  our  international  competitors  over  the  last  decade,  in 
large  part  due  to  the  cost  of  doing  business  (regulatory  and  energy)  here  in  the 
United  States.  How  do  you  think  climate  regulation,  such  as  ‘‘cap  and  trade’’  or  a 
carbon  tax,  help  make  manufacturers  more  competitive  so  we  can  retain  industry 
and jobs? 

Answer.  There  is  no  doubt  that  our  planet  is  warming,  and  the  impacts  of  that 
warming are profound and must be dealt with. If I am confirmed as NOAA Adminis-
trator,  my  primary  concern  will  be  to  ensure  that  businesses  as  well  as  Federal, 
state  and  local  governments  have  the  information  they  need  to  deal  with  the  im-
pacts  of  climate  change.  I  also  hope  that  NOAA  can  play  the  role  of  honest  broker 
in the climate debate by providing uninhibited scientific data and analysis that can 
assist  policymakers  and  Congress  in  developing  regulatory  mechanisms  for  dealing 
with greenhouse gas emissions. 

Question 11. It has been noted by a number of industry representatives that some 
of the climate change proposals over recent years would result in the most expensive 
regulatory  scheme  in  U.S.  history.  In  light  of  the  incoming  Administration’s  efforts 
to  pass  a  ‘stimulus’  package  that  may  well  exceed  $1  trillion,  would  the  cost  to  in-
dustry of complying with climate change regulation be counterproductive? 

Answer.  I  understand  that  regulations  impose  costs  on  the  businesses  that  must 
comply  with  them.  However,  it  has  been  pointed  out  that  the  costs  of  NOT  dealing 
with  climate  change  are  immense  and  potentially  devastating  to  our  economy  and 
society. l note that there are also strong arguments that controlling greenhouse gas 
emissions  will  spawn  a  new  wave  of  technologies  and  business  opportunities  that 
will  both  expand  our  economy  and  improve  our  competitiveness.  Market  based 
mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will create incentives for the devel-
opment  of  new  technologies  that  are  more  energy  efficient  and  less  harmful  to  the 
environment,  and  eventually  will  result  in  more  jobs  and  revenue  for  the  economy 
than  our  current  dependence  on  fossil  fuels.  Regardless  of  these  considerations, 
NOAA  is  not  directly  responsible  for  setting  these  policies.  Its  role  is  to  assisting 
policymakers  by  providing  information  about  ongoing  changes  in  the  climate  and 
likely impacts of future climate changes.

Question  12.  Do  you  support  the  use  of  the  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Act,  in-
cluding  all  the  critical  public  and  transparent  processes  under  the  Act,  to  establish 
future marine protected areas or other marine restricted areas? 

Answer. Yes. 
Question 13. Aerial photography is a commercial activity. It is recognized as such 
in  OMB  Circular  A–76  and  by  virtue  that  other  agencies  (USGS,  FEMA,  TVA, 
USDA,  Corps  of  Engineers)  contract  such  work  to  the  private  sector  in  Louisiana 
and  other  states.  Yet  NOAA  is  still  in  the  business  of  owning  and  operating  their 
own aerial photo planes, and recently buying new ones, and owning cameras, includ-
ing  new  digital  aerial  cameras,  and  collecting  their  own  aerial  photography  when 
this capability already exists in a superior capacity in more than 100 private firms. 
Do you believe it is appropriate for NOAA to be competing with and duplicating the 
private  sector  in  Louisiana  and  other  states,  and  operating  a  commercial  activity 
within the Commerce Department? 

Answer.  I  am  not  yet  familiar  with  the  specific  issues  regarding  NOAA’s  aerial 
photo planes and equipment or OMB Circular A–76. If confirmed, I assure you that 
I  will  study  this  issue  carefully  and  ensure  that  NOAA  resources  are  used  wisely 
and efficiently. 

Question 14. Since 1998 U.S. Department of Commerce Inspector General Reports 
and  GAO  reports  recommended  that  NOAA’s  aircraft  fleet  and  hydrographic  ships 
be privatized, not expanded. In 2000, a NOAA-financed report was conducted by an 
organization  called  ‘‘Mitretek’’  found  that  NOAA’s  aircraft  used  for  aerial  photog-
raphy, is twice as expensive to operate as the equipment used by the private sector 
in  Louisiana  and  other  states.  Will  you  look  at  NOAA  eliminating  these  activities, 
and  help  our  private  sector,  and  our  small  business  in  Louisiana  and  other  states, 
by potentially privatizing these activities, particularly when the GAO, Commerce IG 
and NOAA’s own study show the taxpayer can be better served by contracting these 
services to the more efficient private sector? 

Answer.  I  understand  the  need  to  save  costs  and  minimize  duplication  with  the 
private  sector.  If  confirmed.  I  assure  you  that  1  will  study  this  issue  carefully  and 
ensure that NOAA resources are used wisely and efficiently. 

Question  15.  For  over  a  decade,  Congress  has  been  encouraging  and  indeed  man-
dating  that  NOAA  transition  from  in  house  performance  to  contractor  performance 
of  its  surveying  and  mapping  related  requirements,  including  charting  and  hydro-
graphic surveying. This has been a bipartisan push as not only Congress, but it was 
also  a  Clinton  Administration’s  National  Performance  Review  (also  known  as  Rein-
venting Government) championed by then-Vice President Gore. What steps will you 
take to follow this bipartisan initiative? 

Answer. If confirmed, I pledge to review the studies you mentioned—the GAO Re-
port,  Commerce  IG  report,  and  other  relevant  information—and  review  the  merits 
and cost effectiveness of targeted contractor performance. 

Question 16. Over the past decade, there has been a tendency to seek advice from 
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  to  help  resolve  uncertainties  and  internal  dis-
putes.  This  tendency  reflects  the  hard  reality  that  science  is  not  always  easy  and 
that people can differ and still be responsible and well-meaning. Do you support the 
continued  role  of  the  NAS  to  address  science  issues?  Given  the  delay  this  often 
causes,  do  you  have  an  idea  of  an  alternative  dispute  resolution  forum  that  could 
assist? 

Answer.  I  value  the  important  role  that  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  plays 
in  providing  external  assessments  of  the  state  of  scientific  knowledge  about  key 
issues or reviews of important existing or proposed programs. I also respect the sci-
entific expertise within NOAA. Each has its place. As a scientist, if I am confirmed. 
I  intend  to  pay  close  attention  to  ensuring  that  NOAA  bases  its  decisions  on  the 
best possible scientific information regardless of the source. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO DR. JOHN HOLDREN 

Question  1.  What  do  you  foresee  as  your  greatest  challenge  as  Director  of  OSTP 

(Office of Science and Technology Policy)? 

Answer.  In  a  way,  the  biggest  challenging  facing  OSTP  is  and  always  has  been 
how  to  meet  its  very  diverse  and  substantial  responsibilities  with  the  small  staff 
and  budget  at  its  disposal.  This  challenge  translates  into  the  need  to  recruit  ex-
tremely  talented,  organized,  and  dedicated  staff  members—starting  with  the  Asso-
ciate  Directors  but  extending  right  down  through  the  secretaries—who  will  be  both 
ingenious and hard-working in order to get it all done. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

91 

Another  (and  related)  challenge  is  to  develop  the  needed  working  relationships— 
with the President and Vice President, with the OMB and NSC and NEC, with the 
other  S&T-rich  Executive  Branch  departments  and  agencies,  and  with  the  Con-
gress—without  which  there  is  no  hope  of  OSTP  doing  the  job  that  is  needed  from 
it.  Meeting  this  challenge  is  a  matter  of  investing  the  effort  to  create  and  nurture 
those  relationships  (an  effort  that  must  start  with  but  cannot  be  limited  to  the 
OSTP Director), which means a lot of listening, not just talking. 

These  challenges  of  process  are  large,  but  not  larger  than  the  challenges  of  sub-
stance faced by OSTP in formulating advice—augmenting that of the other relevant 
departments,  agencies  and  offices  and  recognizing  the  prerogatives  of  the  Congress 
about S&T and the economy, S&T and national and homeland security, S&T for na-
tional  and  global  public  health,  the  role  of  S&T  in  addressing  the  energy/climate- 
change/oil-dependence  challenge,  and  more.  The  challenge  facing  OSTP  and  all 
other  organs  of  government  that  deal  with  science  and  technology  is  to  help  figure 
out  how  government,  business,  academia,  and  foundations  and  other  NGO’s  can 
more  effectively  collaborate  in  developing  and  applying  science  and  technology  in 
ways that address all these dimensions of the well-being of our citizens. 

Question  2.  Dr  Holdren,  it  has  been  said  that  climate  change  is  an  issue  that  we 
need  to  innovate  our  way  out  of,  not  regulate  our  way  out  of.  As  the  Director  of 
OSTP, what role do you see yourself playing in technology innovation to address cli-
mate change? 

Answer.  Science,  technology,  and  innovation  are  all  going  to  be  crucial  in  mas-
tering  the  climate-change  challenge.  We  need  to  work  harder  on  the  science  of  cli-
mate change in order to better understand the ways in which the climate is chang-
ing  and  is  likely  to  change  going  forward  and  to  better  understand  all  of  the  lever-
age  points  and  possibilities  for  mitigation  and  adaptation.  We  need  to  make  more 
extensive  use  of  technologies  already  in  hand  for  more  efficient  energy  conversion 
and end-use, lower-carbon electricity generation and liquid-fuel production, and soil 
and forest management to minimize greenhouse-gas emissions. And we need innova-
tion—research,  development,  demonstration,  and  accelerated  deployment—of  im-
proved  and  new  options  for  doing  all  of  these  things  more  efficiently,  less  expen-
sively, and with smaller unwanted side effects. 

With  respect  to  the  science  dimension,  it  is  in  the  nature  of  the  problem  that 
much  of  the  relevant  work  will  need  to  be  funded  and  coordinated  by  the  Federal 
Government, and this means that OSTP should play a role. While most of the fund-
ing in this domain will come through the budgets of NOAA, NASA, NSF, DOE, De-
partment  of  Interior,  Department  of  Agriculture,  EPA,  and  more,  OSTP  has  a  re-
sponsibility to work with OMB and the Congress to see that the needed budgets ma-
terialize and that the tasks are appropriately allocated and coordinated across agen-
cies. This obligation will entail, among other things, working to ensure that the pro-
visions  of  the  Global  Change  Research  Act  (GCRA),  including  modifications  to  it 
likely to be enacted in the new Congress, are properly carried out, and that the Cli-
mate  Change  Science  Program  (CCSP)  that  operates  under  that  act  fulfills  its  re-
sponsibilities and reaches its full potential. OSTP also has a responsibility to ensure 
that  the  findings  of  these  scientific  efforts  are  made  known  to  the  decisionmakers 
in both the Executive Branch and the Congress who need this information in order 
to craft appropriate policies for meeting the climate challenge. 

With respect to the technology and innovation dimensions, the role of the private 
sector  will  be  larger  and  that  of  the  government  small  in  comparison  to  that,  but 
nonetheless  critical  in  relation  to  augmenting  the  incentives  for  firms  and  individ-
uals to choose climate-friendly technologies and for firms to invest in the R&D need-
ed  to  develop  better  ones,  as  well  as  in  contributing  funding  for  early-stage  and 
high-risk R&D where the private sector on its own would do less than society needs. 
The  government’s  role  in  the  technology  and  innovation  aspects  of  the  response  to 
the  climate  challenge  must  also  include  fostering  public-private  partnerships  in  in-
novation  where  the  comparative  advantages  of  both  sectors  are  brought  to  bear,  as 
well as helping with the financing of costly demonstration projects (such as for CO2 
capture and sequestration) where the scale and risk of the needed efforts would in-
hibit  solely  private  approaches.  While,  again,  many  Executive  Branch  departments 
and  agencies  as  well  as  the  Congress  must  be  and  are  involved  in  shaping  and  im-
plementing  these  functions,  a  number  of  which  are  carried  out  under  the  auspices 
of  the  Climate  Change  Technology  Program  (CCTP)  created  under  the  GCRA,  the 
OSTP has an important facilitating and coordinating role. 

Two  further  roles  of  OSTP  in  relation  to  the  climate-change  challenge  should  be 
mentioned, and both have to do with the ‘‘P’’ in OSTP. The existing technologies ger-
mane  to  addressing  the  challenge  will  not  be  deployed,  nor  will  improved  and  new 
ones be developed and deployed, with the pace and in the magnitude that the chal-
lenge  requires  unless  and  until  there  are  national  policies  in  place  that  either  re-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

92 

quire increased use of such technologies or reward their use by penalizing emissions 
of  greenhouse  gases.  In  this  respect,  meeting  the  challenge  is  not  a  matter  of  inno-
vation  or  regulation  but  rather  of  innovation  and  regulation.  And  OSTP  has  a  role 
in helping to ensure that the people crafting the policies have the information they 
need—about  the  science  of  climate  change  and  its  impacts  and  about  the  tech-
nologies  available  to  respond  to  it—in  order  to  make  those  policies  both  adequately 
responsive and technically and economically realistic. 

The  other  relevant  role  of  OSTP  in  the  policy  domain  relates  to  policy  for  the 
strengthening  of  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  (STEM)  edu-
cation our country will need if we are to have the workforce required, going forward, 
to  expand  and  sustain  research  and  innovation  addressing  the  climate  challenge, 
and if we are to have the degree of public understanding of that challenge, and the 
role  of  science  and  technology  in  addressing  it,  required  to  gain  and  sustain  the 
public’s support for the needed efforts. 

Question  2a.  Can  you  outline  a  strategy  to  make  coal  compatible  with  a  safe  cli-

mate? 

Answer.  The  key  here  is  to  finish  developing  and  demonstrating,  and  then  to 
widely  deploy,  technologies  that  can  capture  and  sequester  away  from  the  atmos-
phere  the  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  that  burning  coal  ordinarily  releases  to  the  atmos-
phere. I’m on record in the reports of the independent, bipartisan, foundation-funded 
National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy  (in  which  I  have  served  as  Co-Chair),  and 
elsewhere,  as  favoring  increased  public  and  private  investment  in—and  public-pri-
vate  partnerships  for—research,  development,  and  demonstration  of  such  tech-
nologies. President Obama is also on record favoring this approach, and funding for 
pursuing  it  will  be  part  of  the  $150  billion  he  has  committed  to  spend  over  a  ten- 
year period on clean energy technologies. 

Demonstration  and  pilot-scale  facilities  have  established  or  are  in  the  process  of 
establishing  the  feasibility  of  all  of  the  major  components  needed  for  CO2 capture 
and sequestration (CCS) by a number of different routes, and CCS is being practiced 
on a near-commercial scale using CO2 sources other than coal-burning in several lo-
cations  around  the  world.  It  is  time  to  put  all  of  the  ingredients  together  in  some 
integrated  demonstrations  of  CCS  in  large  coal-burning  power  plants,  using  coals 
of  different  types,  technologies  that  would  be  suitable  for  retrofit  of  existing  plants 
as  well  as  others  that  would  only  attractive  in  plants  built  from  scratch,  and  dif-
ferent geologic formations for the sequestration stage. 

Such projects will help to determine which approaches to capture are going to be 
most versatile and economical and to better characterize the sequestration perform-
ance of a variety of candidate geologic environments. In parallel, work will be need-
ed  to  determine  how  best  to  address  legal  and  regulatory  issues  that  would  arise 
with large-scale use of these technologies. 

CCS will not be inexpensive. Given the cost, CCS technologies for coal-fired power 
plants  will  not  be  deployed  on  a  large  scale  unless  this  is  required  by  regulations 
or  motivated  with  incentives  in  the  form  of  significant  financial  rewards  for  reduc-
ing  CO2 emissions  (achievable,  for  example,  with  tradable  emissions  permits  or  a 
carbon tax). In other words, getting CCS implemented will require significant policy 
initiatives aimed at that result. 

Question 2b. Dr Holdren, you have said that a market signal is necessary for the 
development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies with ongo-
ing  coal  use.  What  role  can  OSTP  (Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy)  play  as 
Congress and the Federal agencies determine what that market may look like? 

Answer. The national climate policy that the country will need in order to get on 
a  path  of  reductions  in  greenhouse-gas  emissions  corresponding  to  the  President’s 
announced  goals  in  this  domain  will  emerge  from  collaboration  and  interaction  be-
tween  the  Executive  Branch  and  the  Congress.  Within  the  executive  branch,  many 
different  departments  and  agencies  will  be  involved,  and  in  recognition  of  the  size 
of the associated coordination challenge a new position of Energy-Climate Policy Co-
ordinator  has  been  created  in  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President  and  filled  by 
former EPA Administrator Carol Browner. The role of OSTP in this process will be 
to  ensure  that  all  of  the  relevant  science  and  technology  information  needed  as 
input to the crafting of sensible climate-policy proposals is available to the President 
and Vice President, to Ms. Browner, to the inter-agency process they will lead, and 
to  see  that  this  science  and  technology  information  is  shared  as  well  with  the  Con-
gress. 

Question 3. Dr. Holdren, coordinating climate science research across the Federal 
Government  is  challenging  given  the  number  of  Federal  agencies  involved  and  dif-
ferent  agency  priorities.  As  the  Director  of  OSTP  (Office  of  Science  and  Technology

Policy),  how  do  you  propose  prioritizing  climate  science  research  efforts  and 
strengthening U.S. research efforts on climate change? 

Answer. If confirmed, I will see that OSTP works with NOAA, NASA, NSF, DOE, 
EPA  and  the  other  relevant  executive-branch  departments  and  offices,  as  well  as 
with the Congress, to ensure . . . 

1.  that  the  Nation  has  a  strong,  integrated  climate-science  program  to  observe, 
understand, predict, and respond to climate change; 
2.  that  OSTP  and  OMB  lead  an  interagency  process  of  budget  coordination, 
identification of areas in need of augmentation, and justification of the budgets 
proposed to Congress; 
3.  that  currently  missing  and  much  needed  capacity  is  added  in  adaptation  re-
search as well as in assessment, outreach, communication, and climate services; 
4. that the requisite 10-year plan, annual report, and National Assessments are 
produced  regularly  and  provide  Congress  with  useful,  policy-relevant  informa-
tion; and 
5.  that  the  USA  is  a  strong  partner  in  international  assessments  and  global 
monitoring. 

I would expect to give early priority, in these efforts, to: (a) bolstering our capacity 
to  monitor  climate  change  and  its  impacts,  including  not  only  expanding  our  moni-
toring networks on land and on the oceans but also strengthening our faltering sys-
tem  of  Earth-observation  satellites;  (b)  substantially  boosting  efforts  in  adaptation 
research; and (c) producing the sorts of integrated assessment of the pace, patterns, 
and regional impacts of climate change that will be needed by the Obama Adminis-
tration  and  the  Congress  as  input  to  their  deliberations  on  the  goals  and  measures 
to be embraced for both mitigation and adaptation. 

Question  4.  Do  you  believe  that  the  current  level  of  Federal  funding  for  research 
and  development  is  adequate?  Are  there  any  areas  you  feel  need  immediate  atten-
tion? 

Answer.  I  believe  we  are  substantially  under-investing  in  research  and  develop-
ment.  Both  President  Obama  and  Congress  have  recognized  this  funding  shortfall 
and have committed to doubling Federal R&D investments in coming years. As one 
recent report concluded, ‘‘Unless substantial investments are made to the engine of 
innovation—basic  scientific  research  and  development—the  current  generation  may 
be  the  first  in  our  country’s  history  to  leave  their  children  and  grandchildren  a 
lower sustained standard of living.’’ 1 

Federal  support  for  the  physical  sciences  and  engineering  has  been  declining  as 
a fraction of GDP for decades, and, after a period of growth of the life sciences, the 
National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  budget  has  been  steadily  losing  buying  power 
for  the  past  5  years.  As  a  result,  our  science  agencies  are  often  able  to  support  no 
more  than  one  in  five  of  the  proposals  that  they  receive,  arresting  the  careers  of 
our young scientists and blocking our ability to pursue many remarkable recent ad-
vances. 

There  is  now  a  growing  recognition  that  new  investments  in  federally  sponsored 
research  can  be  a  direct  investment  in  America’s  future  economic  prosperity.  It  is 
now  well  understood  that  since  World  War  II,  more  than  half  of  overall  economic 
growth is attributable to innovation. 

One key area where we are under funding research is in the area of stem-cell re-
search. Human embryonic stem cells have great potential for treating a wide variety 
of diseases and health conditions and for providing new insights into human devel-
opment  and  disease.  The  Obama  Administration  will  reverse  the  Bush  Administra-
tion’s ban on Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research on cell lines created 
after  August  9,  2001  by  Executive  Order  and  will  allow  all  scientists  to  participate 
in  this  important  new  field,  in  accord  with  the  rigorous  ethical  guidelines  proposed 
by the National Research Council. 

Question  4a.  Do  you  believe  that  the  current  balance  of  Federal  funding  for  re-
search  and  development  across  science  and  engineering  disciplines  is  appropriate? 
If not, how do you believe the portfolio of funding should be rebalanced? 

Answer. One of the important roles of OSTP and its director is helping to achieve 
balance  in  our  Federal  R&D  portfolio.  I  am  not  yet  familiar  enough  with  all  of  the 
portfolio’s  pieces  to  offer  any  specific  thoughts  at  this  time  on  what  rebalancing 
might be needed. If confirmed, I will certainly work closely with the relevant cabinet

departments  and  agencies,  the  OMB,  and  the  Congress  to  arrive  at  a  coordinated 
and balanced R&D funding portfolio for contemporary conditions and challenges.

Question  4b.  Do  you  believe  that  interdisciplinary  research  is  sufficiently  sup-
ported? If not, what actions would you take to increase the funding to support such 
research? 

Answer. Many of the most exciting opportunities in research lie at the boundaries 
between disciplines. Multidisciplinary research is important for achieving many crit-
ical  national  goals,  moreover,  because  the  challenges  we  face—whether  in  innova-
tion for economic growth, or developing a climate-friendly energy system, or making 
our  society  more  secure  against  terrorists—can  only  be  successfully  addressed  by 
combining tools, techniques, and insights from researchers in different fields. 

Funding  interdisciplinary  work  can  be  challenging,  in  part  because  of  the  added 
complexity  of  peer  review  in  interdisciplinary  domains  and  in  part  because  such 
work  can  be  seen  as  competing  with  established  fields  of  research  in  a  ‘‘zero-sum 
game.’’ This problem can be greatly reduced if total Federal investments in research 
are  expanding  in  the  manner  that  President  Obama  and  the  Congress  have  envi-
sioned,  so  that  interdisciplinary  efforts  can  be  expanded  without  reducing  support 
for more traditional areas of research. 

Question 5. Dr. Holdren, do you see a role for the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy  to  help  the  Federal  Government  improve  acquisition,  management  and  over-
sight of civilian satellite programs? 

Answer.  OSTP  can  play  an  important  role  in  coordinating  interagency  satellite 
policy.  I  believe  we  must  increase  government  oversight  and  improve  the  inter-
agency partnerships central to the management of civilian satellite programs, which 
among other things are critical to the Nation’s climate and weather forecasting. 

We  need  to  proactively  manage  our  programs  to  avert  future  cost  and  schedule 
overruns.  Agencies  must  work  together  to  manage  the  contractors  building  these 
satellites and demand cost and schedule accountability. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BARBARA BOXER TO 

DR. JOHN HOLDREN 

Question  1.  There  are  many  areas  where  the  jurisdictions  of  scientific  agencies 
overlap,  particularly  with  respect  to  environmental  issues  such  as  climate  change. 
Federal agencies have been criticized in the past for a lack of coordination on these 
areas of overlap, leading to duplicative efforts or incomplete information. As the Di-
rector  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  part  of  your  responsibilities 
will entail leading interagency efforts to develop sound science policies and budgets. 
How  will  you  promote  coordination  among  agencies  on  long-term  climate  change 
data  collection  and  analysis,  as  well  as  research  on  the  environmental  and  health 
impacts of nanotechnology? 

Answer. We face enormous challenges in energy and climate and need to act both 
quickly  and  carefully.  An  effective  strategy  will  affect  many  parts  of  our  economy, 
and  many  different  Executive  Branch  agencies,  as  well  as  the  Congress,  will  have 
roles  in  developing  and  implementing  it.  Fortunately  the  President  has  assembled 
a  team  of  leaders  in  the  energy  and  climate  domain  who  are  not  only  experienced 
but who have nearly all worked with each other previously; this will make coordina-
tion  easier.  As  Director  of  OSTP  (if  confirmed),  I’d  also  plan  to  harness  the  inter-
agency  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC),  which  has  traditionally 
been coordinated by OSTP, to the task of helping ensure effective, coherent prepara-
tion of plans, budgeting, and execution of multi-agency efforts. (On this issue, please 
see also my answers to Senator Rockefeller’s questions 3 and 4, above.) 

Nanotechnology  has  the  potential  to  lead  to  major  economic  and  other  societal 
benefits, such as low-cost solar cells, smart anti-cancer therapeutics, sensors for en-
vironmental monitoring, and breakthroughs in our ability to store and process infor-
mation. It is clear, however, that we need to increase our understanding of the envi-
ronment,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  risks  associated  with  nanotechnology.  I  am  com-
mitted  to  using  the  NSTC  to  identify  gaps  in  our  current  nano-EHS  research  port-
folio and to increase the exchange of information among science agencies, regulatory 
agencies,  and  external  stakeholders.  Our  strategy  will  build  on  the  existing  work 
of  the  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implications  (NEHI)  Working 
Group,  and  will  incorporate  information  from  a  recent  National  Research  Council 
review along with inputs from stakeholders in industry, academia, and non-govern-
mental organizations. 

Question 2. As you know, the economic stimulus bill includes funding for basic sci-
entific research and development across several agencies and missions. How do you

plan  to  help  coordinate  these  investments  and  ensure  that  this  money  is  allocated 
effectively,  efficiently  and  responsibly  across  the  many  agencies  with  science  and 
technology related missions? 

Answer. The stimulus investments in basic R&D in various agencies are not only 
crucial for creating new jobs and opportunities for today, they are essential for cre-
ating  the  new  industries  and  long-term  opportunities  that  we  will  need  for  tomor-
row.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work  closely  with  these  agencies  to  ensure  that  these  in-
vestments  produce  results.  In  addition,  I  intend  to  work  closely  with  the  Nation’s 
Chief  Technology  Officer  and  a  new  Open  Government  Initiative  to  transform  gov-
ernment through transparency, participation, and collaboration. At the heart of this 
effort  is  a  new  website  called  recovery.gov  which  is  an  unprecedented  effort  focused 
on  ensuring  that  stimulus  dollars  are  used  effectively,  efficiently,  and  responsibly. 
Question  3.  I  appreciate  the  commitment  you  expressed  in  your  statement  to  ele-
vating  the  role  of  science  in  formulating  policy  decisions  and  revitalizing  our  econ-
omy. I would just like you to elaborate more on one aspect of science that you only 
touched on briefly—ocean science. How will you work to ensure that adequate fund-
ing  and  technical  resources  are  devoted  to  achieving  the  Ocean  Research  Priorities 
Plan and Implementation Strategy, including reevaluating and revising the strategy 
as necessary? 

Answer.  Oceans  are  crucial  to  our  well-being  because  they  play  a  central  role  in 
global  weather  and  climate,  are  a  major  source  of  protein  for  much  of  the  world’s 
population, provide employment in fisheries and recreation, serve as home to much 
of  the  planet’s  biodiversity,  and  more.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work  with  NOAA  and 
other  relevant  agencies,  as  well  as  with  the  Congress,  to  complete  and  implement 
the  strong,  integrated,  well-managed  program  of  ocean  research  and  stewardship 
that  is  essential  to  sustain  a  healthy  and  productive  marine  environment  and  the 
communities  that  depend  upon  it.  The  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  and  Imple-
mentation Strategy developed by the NSTC’s Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science 
and  Technology  in  the  last  administration  appears  to  provide  a  useful  framework 
for  analyzing  needs  and  moving  ahead  with  meeting  them,  but  I  would  want  to 
study  it  more  closely  and  seek  input  from  the  relevant  Executive  Branch  agencies 
and  committees  of  Congress  before  reaching  any  conclusions  about  what  revisions 
in it might be warranted. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

DR. JOHN HOLDREN 

Question 1. Costs for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Sat-
ellite  System  have  spiraled  out  of  control  from  $6.5  billion  to  at  least  $92.5  billion. 
Isn’t one of the challenges facing this program the fact that it’s a tri-agency acquisi-
tion involving NOAA, NASA and DOD? 

Answer.  Yes.  The  management  of  the  NPOESS  program  and  ensuring  continuity 
of weather and climate data need to be important priorities for the administration’s 
leadership  team.  The  tri-agency  leadership  in  NOAA,  NASA,  and  DOD  needs  to  be 
better coordinated and more clearly focused on oversight of and accountability from 
the  program  contractors,  and  if  confirmed  as  Director  of  OSTP  I  would  expect  to 
help with that. 

Question  1a.  I’m  going  to  be  holding  Dr.  Lubchenco’s  feet  to  the  fire  on  this,  but 
wouldn’t  you  agree  that  because  this  troubled  program  involves  three  agencies,  she 
can’t do this alone? 

Answer.  I  have  known  and  worked  with  Dr.  Lubchenco  for  more  than  20  years, 
and  I  have  immense  confidence  in  her  abilities.  But  certainly  in  the  multi-agency 
activity in question there is a role for both OMB and OSTP in helping with manage-
ment and coordination. 

Question  1b.  Wouldn’t  you  agree  that  she  is  going  to  need  help  from  higher-up 

Answer. Absolutely. 

in the Administration to make this work? 

Answer. I am confident that whatever help she needs will be provided. 
Question  1c.  Can  you  promise  me  that  you  and  others  in  the  White  House  will 
help apply the pressure needed to fix this program and make this tri-agency acquisi-
tion work? 

Answer. Yes. 
Question  2.  If  nominated,  will  you  work  with  me  and  Committee  to  pass  climate 
change  adaptation  legislation  that  will  help  ensure  our  government  takes  climate 
change  into  account  when  investing  taxpayer  dollars  in  various  infrastructure 
projects and in managing our Nation’s public lands?

96 

Question 3. I recall you were a member of the Presidential Committee of Advisors 
on  Science  and  Technology  (PCAST)  Energy  Research  and  Development  Panel  that 
issued  the  November  1997  report  entitled  ‘Federal  Energy  Research  and  Develop-
ment for the Challenges of the Twenty-First Century’. Among other things, that re-
port  proposed  funding  levels  for  a  variety  of  clean  energy  technologies  that  to  its 
credit  has  sewed  as  the  basis  for  these  types  of  investments  for  over  the  past  dec-
ade.  Looking  back  at  the  report,  where  do  you  believe  that  the  PCAST  panel  hit 
the  mark,  where  do  you  believe  that  its  aim  was  a  little  off,  and  looking  forward, 
do  you  see  a  need  for  a  major  recalibration  of  priorities  within  our  Nation’s  clean 
energy portfolio? 

Answer. I appreciate these kind comments about the 1997 PCAST report on Fed-
eral energy R&D that I chaired. In the intervening decade and more it has become 
clear that the climate-change driver of energy R&D requirements—which is far from 
the  only  driver  but  was  recognized  by  our  Committee  already  in  1997  as  the  most 
demanding  one—is  even  more  demanding  than  we  thought  in  terms  of  the  kinds 
and  degree  of  energy-technology  improvements  that  will  be  required  if  the  climate- 
change challenge is to be adequately and affordably addressed. 

And,  although  we  recognized  at  the  time  that  the  Federal  Government  needs  to 
play  a  role,  in  concert  with  the  private  sector,  in  commercial-scale  demonstration 
as  well  as  in  R&D  of  some  of  the  needed  advanced  technologies,  it  is  now  clearer 
how large and costly that role needs to be. That is why the Obama campaign talked 
about  $15  billion  per  year  for  clean  energy  research,  development,  and  demonstra-
tion (RD&D) for the next 10 years. One place we certainly missed the mark in 1997 
was  in  seriously  understating  what  should  be  spent  on  research  and  development 
of CO2 capture and sequestration. 

Several substantial efforts at designing a suitable portfolio of clean-energy RD&D 
going  forward  have  been  underway  over  the  past  couple  of  years  in  the  National 
Research Council, in a set of university and NGO efforts funded by the Doris Duke 
Charitable  Foundation,  and  elsewhere,  and  some  of  these  are  expected  to  release 
their  findings  over  the  next  few  months.  I  know  that  Secretary  Chu  and  his  staff 
at  DOE  will  be  reviewing  the  existing  portfolio  there,  and  the  plans  for  the  next 
few  years,  in  light  of  all  these  findings  as  well  as  their  own  internal  analyses.  The 
Obama  Administration’s  energy-climate  principals’  group  being  convened  by  Carol 
Browner will be looking at this question in the context of all of the relevant Execu-
tive  Branch  agencies.  As  I  am  part  of  that  process  and  will  continue  to  be  if  con-
firmed  by  the  Senate  as  Director  of  OSTP,  I  don’t  want  to  pre-empt  it  here  with 
too many of my personal views. I can certainly assure you that this question of the 
clean-energy  RD&D  portfolio  is  one  I  and  others  in  the  Administration  are  giving 
the  closest  scrutiny  and  will,  obviously,  be  in  close  touch  with  the  Congress  about. 
Question 4. Should we as a Nation be concerned with the increasing globalization 
of  R&D  and  innovation?  What  are  some  of  the  things  you  plan  to  do  as  the  Presi-
dent’s  science  advisor  to  ensure  continued  U.S.  competitiveness  in  the  global  mar-
ketplace of R&D and innovation? 

Answer.  Ensuring  that  the  U.S.  continues  to  lead  the  world  in  science  and  tech-
nology will be a central priority for me if I am confirmed as Director of OSTP. Our 
talent for innovation is still the envy of the world, but we face unprecedented chal-
lenges  that  demand  new  approaches.  I  am  especially  concerned  that  we  have  been 
reducing  support  for  science  at  a  time  when  many  other  nations  are  increasing  it, 
a  situation  that  already  threatens  our  leadership  in  many  critical  areas  of  science. 
This  competitive  situation  may  only  worsen  over  time  because  the  number  of  U.S. 
students pursuing technical careers is declining. The U.S. ranks 17th among devel-
oped nations in the proportion of college students receiving degrees in science or en-
gineering; we were in third place thirty years ago. 

That is why I believe we must increase funding for basic research in physical and 
life  sciences,  mathematics,  and  engineering  at  a  rate  that  would  double  basic  re-
search budgets over the next decade. We need to increase research grants for early- 
career  researchers  to  keep  young  scientists  entering  these  fields.  We  need  to  in-
crease  support  for  high-risk,  high-payoff  research  portfolios  at  our  science  agencies. 
And  we  need  to  invest  in  the  breakthrough  research  we  need  to  meet  our  energy 
challenges and to transform our defense programs. 

Question  5.  What  do  we  need  to  do  as  a  Nation  to  convince  more  women  and 
underrepresented  minorities  to  pursue  career  paths  in  Science,  Technology,  Engi-
neering, and Mathematical fields? And if they do choose to pursue careers in STEM 
fields, what, if any, policies can be put in place to make it easier for them to remain 
in these career paths. 

Answer. I would be especially proud, if confirmed, to serve a President who under-
stands the importance of women and minorities in science. For example in the U.S. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Senate,  Senator  Obama  passed  three  amendments  to  the  America  COMPETES  Act 
to  increase  participation  of  women  and  underrepresented  minorities  in  the  profes-
sions of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; to offer competitive state 
grants  to  support  summer  term  education  programs  to  help  students  develop  skills 
in math and problem solving; and to establish a mentoring program for women and 
minorities as they advance in those fields. 

All  Americans  will  need  strong  STEM  backgrounds  to  participate  effectively  in  a 
competitive global economy. President Obama has made it clear to me that this will 
be one of my most important responsibilities if confirmed. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

DR. JOHN HOLDREN 

Question  1.  Last  August,  this  Committee  held  a  hearing  on  our  Nation’s  failure 
to  invest  in  next-generation  climate  modeling  capability.  As  a  result,  we  are  falling 
behind  in  our  ability  to  predict  climate  impacts  at  the  regional  and  local  scale.  At 
that  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  the  need  for  an  integrated,  interagency  effort 
to  address  the  range  of  research,  software,  data  storage  and  computing  challenge 
associated  with  climate  modeling.  How  should  that  be  structured?  What  is  the  ap-
propriate role for NOAA? 

Answer.  I  understand  the  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act  includes 
$170  million  for  NOAA  to  address  critical  gaps  in  climate  modeling  and  establish 
climate data records for continuing research into the cause, effects and ways to miti-
gate  climate  change.  NOAA  will  clearly  have  an  instrumental  role.  But  we  can  do 
more across agencies as well to build on our climate modeling capabilities. This new 
funding is another important piece of the interagency efforts to be coordinated with 
other  climate  science  efforts  as  needed  to  ensure  an  integrated  research  effort.  Im-
proving  our  climate  modeling  capability  is  critical  to  furthering  our  understanding 
of the impacts of climate change in society, and will be a priority under my leader-
ship at OSTP, if confirmed. 

Question  2.  The  underlying  authorizing  legislation  for  the  National  Nanotechnol-
ogy  Initiative  allows  the  President  to  ‘‘establish  or  designate’’  an  advisory  board 
composed  of  members  with  expert  knowledge  of  nanotechnology  from  academia,  in-
dustry,  and  non-profit/advocacy  organizations.  President  Bush  opted  to  designate 
PCAST  (President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology)  instead  of  ap-
pointing  a  new  advisory  board.  However,  many  criticized  this  move,  citing  that 
PCAST did not have the specific expert knowledge to review the NNI. According to 
a National Academies of Science review on the NNI, they state that: 

Answer.  While  the  designation  of  PCAST  as  the  NNI  advisory  panel  testifies  to 
the importance of the initiative, it lacks an independent advisory group with specific 
expertise  in  nanoscience  and  nanotechnology.  Such  a  dedicated  panel  could  provide 
advice  on  setting  priorities,  balancing  large-scale  and  individual  investigator  re-
search, and the value of high-risk, high pay-off interdisciplinary research. 

As  a  result,  the  NAS  recommended  that  ‘‘The  Federal  Government  should  estab-
lish an independent advisory panel with appropriate experience to facilitate cutting- 
edge research on and responsible development of nanotechnology.’’ 

OSTP  transition  team  members  have  indicated  that  they  prefer  not  to  establish 
a new board and will continue to rely on PCAST. They believe that the new PCAST 
would be a vastly improved advisory mechanism, but the concern still remains that 
given  PCAST’s  wide  mandate  to  advise  on  all  aspects  of  science  and  technology, 
there is insufficient expertise in nanotechnology to provide proper oversight over the 
NNI. 

Question 2a. Do you believe that the President should appoint an independent ad-
visory board to review the NNI, as mandated by law? If no, please explain why you 
feel  that  conducting  oversight  over  the  NNI  through  PCAST  is  sufficient?  In  my 
nanotechnology  bill  that  I  introduced  last  year,  I  make  it  very  clear  the  need  for 
an independent advisory board with specific nanotechnology expertise. Will you com-
mit to working with me on this matter as we move forward on this legislation? 

Answer.  My  current  view  is  that  the  President  will  be  best  served  by  having 
PCAST,  with  its  diverse  group  of  distinguished  experts  in  science,  technology,  and 
innovation from industry and academia, function as the sole Presidential-level advi-
sory  committee  on  S&T.  I  believe  that  establishing  multiple  Presidential  advisory 
committees  will  diminish  the  influence  and  effectiveness  of  any  one  of  them.  As  a 
practical  matter,  given  all  of  the  competing  demands  on  the  President’s  schedule, 
he  is  unlikely  to  be  able  to  have  meaningful  interaction  with  more  than  one  such 
committee.

On important topics such as nanotechnology, however, I will recommend that the 
President establish committees under the aegis of PCAST that will have the stature 
and in-depth expertise needed to provide the Administration with high-quality, inde-
pendent  advice  on  the  important  issues  you  raise.  I  look  forward  to  working  with 
you on this topic to meet our shared goals. 

Question 3. Nanoscale science, engineering and technology—commonly referred to 
collectively as nanotechnology—is believed by many to offer extraordinary economic 
and  societal  benefits.  Congress  has  demonstrated  continuing  support  for  nanotech-
nology  and  has  directed  its  attention  primarily  to  three  topics  that  may  affect  the 
realization  of  this  hoped  for  potential:  Federal  research  and  development  (R&D)  in 
nanotechnology;  U.S.  competitiveness;  and  environment,  health,  and  safety  (ENS) 
concerns.  In  2000,  the  United  States  launched  the  world’s  first  national  nanotech-
nology program. Since then, the Federal Government has invested nearly $10 billion 
in  nanoscale  science,  engineering,  and  technology  through  the  U.S.  National  Nano-
technology  Initiative  (NNI).  U.S.  companies  and  state  governments  have  invested 
billions more. As a result of this focus and these investments, the United States has, 
in  the  view  of  many  experts,  emerged  as  a  global  leader  in  nanotechnology.  How-
ever, the competition for global leadership in nanotechnology is intensifying as coun-
tries and companies around the world increase their investments. The Federal Gov-
ernment  has  invested,  through  FY2009,  nearly  $10  billion  in  nanotechnology  R&D. 
What  role  can  the  Federal  Government  play  in  further  helping  industry  commer-
cialize this research? 

Answer.  The  NNI  can  expand  its  role  in  promoting  nanotechnology  transfer  and 

commercialization for societal benefit by: 

a.  Coordinating  with  regional,  state,  and  local  organizations  supporting  nano-
technology development and commercialization; 
b. Working with industry through mechanisms such as the Nanomanufacturing, 
Industry Liaison and Innovation Working Group; 
c.  Taking  advantage  of  programs  such  as  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Re-
search (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STIR); 
d. Supporting additional public-private partnerships using mechanisms such as 
the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative  and  other  government-industry-univer-
sity collaborations. 

Question 3a. Environmental, health, and safety issues have become a top concern 
about  nanotechnology.  How  much  additional  funding  should  be  provided  to  support 
EHS  research?  How  should  this  money  be  allocated  among  agencies?  Should  a  por-
tion  of  these  funds  be  used  as  a  central  funding  source  to  respond  to  needs  that 
agencies  are  not  currently  addressing?  If  so,  how  should  such  a  funding  source  be 
structured and managed? 

Answer.  I  share  the  goal  of  promoting  the  responsible  development  of  nanotech-
nology.  OSTP  is  carefully  evaluating  proposals  for  targeted  funding  increases  for 
nano-related EHS research. There are important knowledge gaps in the EHS dimen-
sions of nano identified that we should address quickly as possible. I do not believe 
that  there  is  a  single  agency  that  is  in  a  position  to  sponsor  or  conduct  all  of  the 
necessary research. This is because of the important roles played by a variety of dif-
ferent  agencies  on  the  environment,  occupational  safety,  the  oversight  of  drugs, 
medical devices, and consumer products, and the management of the National Toxi-
cological Program. 

Question 3b. Do you believe that rapid advances in nanotechnology, biotechnology, 
and  other  emerging  fields  present  any  challenges  to  the  U.S.  and  global  regulatory 
systems? If so, how might you seek to address them? 

Answer.  In  many  instances,  emerging  technologies  have  advanced  more  rapidly 
than  our  ability  to  establish  a  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  that  maxi-
mizes  the  economic  and  societal  benefits  while  managing  the  risks.  For  example,  it 
is  clear  that  there  are  gaps  in  our  understanding  of  the  EHS  dimensions  of  nano-
technology.  It  is  likely  that  several  key  regulatory  agencies  will  need  to  increase 
their capacity to promote the responsible development of nanotechnology. There are 
also  important  questions  a  out  how  to  apply  existing  laws  and  regulations  to  nano-
technology-based products. If confirmed, I am committed to working closely with the 
relevant agencies to create a sound policy and regulatory framework. 

Question 4. Patients and researchers have been frustrated for 7 years as they try 
to forge ahead in one of the most promising areas of biological research—embryonic 
stem cell research. The progress that has been made in just a decade is astounding 
and  the  expectations  for  therapeutic  applications  for  the  results  of  this  research 
have  never  been  higher  for  the  millions  of  patients  around  living  with  disease  for 
which this research holds out hope. But, researchers are grappling with Federal re-

99 

strictions  on  funding  the  equivalent  of  tying  one  hand  behind  their  back.  Can  we 
assume relief is forthcoming so we can get the Federal Government fully behind this 
research? 

Answer.  Yes.  Stem  cell  research  holds  the  promise  of  improving  our  lives  in  at 
least  three  ways—by  substituting  normal  cells  for  damaged  cells  to  treat  diabetes, 
Parkinson’s  disease,  spinal  cord  injury,  heart  failure  and  other  disorders;  by  pro-
viding  scientists  with  safe  and  convenient  models  of  disease;  and  by  helping  to  un-
derstand fundamental aspects of normal development and cell dysfunction. 

For  these  reasons,  I  strongly  support  expanding  research  on  stem  cells.  I  believe 
that the restrictions that President Bush has placed on funding of human embryonic 
stem  cell  research  have  handcuffed  our  scientists  and  hindered  our  ability  to  com-
pete  with  other  nations.  I  expect  President  Obama  to  lift  the  current  funding  ban 
soon. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK WARNER TO 

DR. JOHN HOLDREN 

Question.  In  follow  up  to  our  previous  exchange,  I  would  appreciate  a  further 
elaboration  of  President  Obama’s  and  your  vision  concerning  the  role  of  the  CTO. 
Virginia  and  other  states  that  have  created  a  cabinet-level  Secretary  of  Technology 
can provide valuable insight regarding this position. I recognize that this individual 
has not yet been chosen, but can you elaborate on what you consider to be the most 
important  qualities  and  characteristics  for  the  position?  Will  this  person  look  out-
ward toward the private sector to identify innovative techniques and practices to be 
incorporated  within  the  Federal  Government?  Also,  how  will  this  person  interact 
with  other  agencies  and  what  role  will  the  CTO  have  in  terms  of  policy  execution 
in each realm? 

Answer.  Indeed,  Virginia  has  been  a  leader  and  provides  an  important  model  for 
the  Federal  CTO.  As  you  know  in  the  21st  century,  our  economic  success  will  de-
pend  not  only  on  our  ability  to  invent  new  technologies  but  also  in  our  ability  to 
harness  the  power  and  potential  of  new  technologies  to  address  some  of  our  most 
pressing problems. 

That  is  why  President  Obama  has  promised  to  appoint  the  Nation’s  first  Chief 
Technology Officer (CTO)—to ensure that our government and all its agencies have 
the  right  infrastructure,  policies  and  services  for  the  21st  century.  The  CTO  will 
have  a  specific  focus  on  transparency,  by  ensuring  that  each  arm  of  the  Federal 
Government  makes  its  records  open  and  accessible  as  the  E-Government  Act  re-
quires.  The  CTO  will  also  focus  on  using  new  technologies  to  solicit  and  receive  in-
formation  back  from  citizens  to  improve  the  functioning  of  democratic  government. 
While  a  CIO  may  be  more  inward  facing,  the  CTO  may  be  more  outward  facing 
and can help ensure technological interoperability of key government functions. For 
example,  the  Chief  Technology  Officer  will  oversee  the  development  of  a  national, 
interoperable  wireless  network  for  local,  state  and  Federal  first  responders  as  the 
9/11  Commission  recommended.  This  will  ensure  that  fire  officials,  police  officers 
and  EMTs  from  different  jurisdictions  have  the  ability  to  communicate  with  each 
other  during  a  crisis  and  we  do  not  have  a  repeat  of  the  failure  to  deliver  critical 
public services that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

DR. JOHN HOLDREN 

Question 1. In 1971, in an article with Paul Ehrlich titled Global Ecology, you pre-
dicted  that  ‘‘some  form  of  ecocatastrophe,  if  not  thermonuclear  war,  seems  almost 
certain  to  overtake  us  before  the  end  of  the  century.’’  Now  that  it  is  2008,  what  is 
the reason neither of those things happened? 

Answer.  One  of  the  many  things  I  have  learned  in  the  nearly  four  decades  since 
I  wrote  those  words  is  that,  as  Enrico  Fermi  famously  said,  ‘‘Predictions  are  dif-
ficult,  especially  about  the  future.’’  But  even  then,  at  the  age  of  26,  I  knew  enough 
to hedge a little bit: I did say ‘‘almost certain.’’ 

I  do  think  that  we  were  at  least  as  lucky  as  we  were  smart  in  managing  to  get 
through  the  decades  of  the  Cold  War  without  a  nuclear  war—there  were  certainly 
a number of close calls. I think that most of the presidents, generals, and admirals 
who commanded our nuclear forces through those years would agree we were lucky. 
A number of them have told me as much. 

As for ecological catastrophe, there’s no agreed definition on precisely what would 
qualify,  but  certainly  there  are  reasonable  people  who  would  argue  we  are  in  the 
middle  of  a  number  of  them:  the  staggering  rate  of  species  extinctions  (for  which 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

100 

the  best  estimates  are  in  the  range  of  100  to  1000  times  the  extinction  rate  over 
most  of  pre-human  time);  the  expanding  dead  zones  in  coastal  seas;  the  decline  in 
the  global  populations  of  sharks,  billfish,  and  tuna  to  perhaps  10  percent  of  their 
pre-human levels; and the continuing rapid deforestation of the tropics. 

To the extent that nothing that everybody would agree is a full-blown catastrophe 
has yet materialized, I would say, as in the case of nuclear war, that we have been 
partly smart and partly lucky. On the smart side, since 1971 the world rate of popu-
lation  growth  has  fallen  by  almost  half;  we  have  developed  and  deployed  tech-
nologies that have reduced the amount of energy and other physical resources need-
ed to make a dollar of GDP and that have reduced the amount of pollution emitted 
in the course of providing a kilowatt-hour of electricity or a pound of steel; we have 
established  Marine  Protected  Areas  where  fish  stocks  can  recover  from  over-exploi-
tation; and we have invested substantial resources in cleaning up inland waters and 
toxic waste dumps. 

Those  are  outcomes  that  those  of  us  who  were  issuing  warnings  about  environ-
mental  dangers  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  were  recommending  at  the  time  as  ways 
to  reduce  those  dangers.  Our  aim  in  discussing  the  harm  that  was  likely  to  occur 
if  society  did  not  take  evasive  action  was  to  help  bring  that  evasive  action  about. 
I am happy to say that environmental laws passed by the U.S. Congress—including 
NEPA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Surface Mining Act, the Endan-
gered  Species  Act,  the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act,  the  Resource  Conservation 
and Recovery Act, and CAFE´ standards—played a large part in this country’s doing 
what was needed to reduce some of the biggest dangers. 

Question  2.  In  1986,  you  predicted  that  global  warming  would  cause  the  deaths 
of one billion people by 2020. Paul Ehrlich attributes this claim to you in his article 
The  Machinery  of  Nature.  Do  you  believe  that  number  is  still  accurate?  If  not,  can 
you give us a revised number? 

Answer.  I  believe  what  I  wrote  was  that  global  climate  change  could  cause  the 
deaths of a billion people by 2020. This was not a prediction but a statement about 
what  could  happen  if  climate  change  crossed  a  tipping  point  in  the  intervening  pe-
riod,  leading  to  large  declines  in  food  production.  I  think  this  is  not  likely,  but  I 
believe  it  is  a  ‘‘downside’’  outcome  that  we  should  be  investing  significant  effort  to 
avoid. 

Question 3. In 1978 you stated in a University of Houston Law Review, that ‘‘peo-
ple are the bane of rational energy policy.’’ Can you explain what you meant by that 
and who or what would be appropriate for drafting rational energy policy? 

Answer.  The  sentence  as  a  whole  said  the  following:  ‘‘However,  if  people  are  the 
bane  of  rational  energy  planning,  they  are  also  its  goal.’’  As  explained  in  the  sur-
rounding  text,  what  I  meant  was  that  the  best-laid  plans  are  often  thwarted  by 
human  frailty  and  unpredictability  (oil  tankers  running  aground,  actions  of  the 
OPEC cartel, etc) and also that people often want contradictory things from energy 
policy:  they  want  their  energy  to  be  convenient,  reliable,  free  of  environmental  im-
pacts and political liabilities, and dirt cheap; and if there are going to be some envi-
ronmental  impacts,  they  want  them  to  be  in  somebody  else’s  back  yard.  The  sur-
rounding  text  also  explained  that  saying  people  are  the  goal  of  energy  planning 
means we should not be interested in expanding energy supply for its own sake, but 
rather  in  doing  so  in  ways  and  for  purposes  that  increase  the  sum  of  human  well- 
being. 

One  reason  energy  policy  is  so  challenging,  as  I  argued  in  that  article,  is  that 
there is no ‘‘free lunch’’ in energy supply. The energy options that are the cheapest 
are  often  the  dirtiest  ones  (as  coal  power  plants  without  environmental  controls 
demonstrate) or the most problematic from the political and security standpoint (as 
the  cheap  imported  oil  of  the  early  1970s  demonstrated).  And  if  nobody  is  willing 
to  accept  any  environmental  intrusion  at  all  from  energy  systems—no  coal  mines 
or  drilling  rigs  anywhere,  no  pipelines  across  the  tundra,  no  transmission  lines  or 
windmills spoiling the view—that’s eventually going to mean not having the energy 
we need. 

Developing  sensible  energy  policy  would  be  easier  if  we  who  have  studied  the 
issue—scientists and Senators alike—did a better job of educating the public to un-
derstand  that  there  are  tradeoffs  in  getting  the  energy  we  need  and  that  cheaper 
is not always better (particularly if the low monetary cost comes from not including 
in the price of energy the cost of limiting environmental damages and national-secu-
rity  liabilities  that  otherwise  not  just  the  users  of  the  energy  but  the  whole  society 
will have to live with). I note that the thrust of my 1978 article in the Houston Law 
Review,  which  was  entitled  ‘‘Coal  in  Context:  Its  Role  in  the  National  Energy  Fu-
ture,’’  was  precisely  that  coal  is  so  important  to  U.S.  energy  supply  that  we  simply 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

101 

must  make  the  effort  to  reduce  its  environmental  impacts  to  the  point  that  contin-
ued use of coal will be environmentally tolerable and acceptable to the public. 

I  believe  that  the  most  appropriate  people  to  be  making  energy  policy  are  our 
elected representatives, meaning, at the national level, the Congress and the Presi-
dent  and  Vice  President.  Obviously,  these  elected  leaders  need  to  be  informed  by 
the best advice they can get from their appointed staffs and the agencies over which 
these appointees preside and, of course, by the views of business people, academics, 
NGO’s  of  all  varieties,  and  the  wider  public.  Making  sure  that  our  elected  leaders 
and all those who report to them or seek to influence them are well informed about 
the  scientific  and  technological  dimensions  of  the  energy-policy  choices  (and  other 
policy  choices!)  faced  by  our  Nation  will  be  important  to  getting  the  best  possible 
results.  The  White  House  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  that  I  hope  to 
have  the  privilege  of  directing  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  helping  to  ensure 
that this information flow works as it should. 

Question  4.  In  1973  you  encouraged  a  ‘‘decline  in  fertility  to  well  below  replace-
ment’’  in  the  United  States,  because  ‘‘280  million  in  2040  is  likely  to  be  too  many.’’ 
This was in your article ‘‘Population and the American Predicament.’’ Currently the 
U.S.  population  is  304  million.  What  are  your  thoughts  at  this  juncture  on  the  ap-
propriate population level? 

Answer. Population growth brings both benefits and liabilities. In the 1973 article 
cited,  I  offered  the  personal  judgment  that  the  then  U.S.  population  of  212  million 
was  more  than  large  enough  to  provide  most  of  the  benefits  associated  with  high 
population  and  that  further  growth  was  likely  to  increase  costs  more  than  it  in-
creased  benefits.  Balancing  costs  and  benefits  of  population  growth  is  a  complex 
business,  of  course,  and  reasonable  people  can  disagree  about  where  it  comes  out 
For  my  part,  I  don’t  pretend  to  know  what  the  best  eventual  population  for  the 
United  States  would  be.  That  is  partly  a  matter  of  how  good  our  technology  and 
our  management  can  be  in  the  future,  partly  a  matter  of  environmental  and  re-
source constraints that are still imperfectly understood, and partly a matter of social 
preferences  that  are  well  outside  the  domain  of  science  and  technology  policy  in 
which I’d be engaged if the Senate confirms me as Director of OSTP. 

Question 5. In 2006, in the article The War on Hot Air, you suggested that global 
sea  levels  could  rise  by  13  feet  by  the  end  of  this  century.  However,  in  the  IPCC’s 
2007  report  the  suggested  potential  is  a  rise  of  13  inches.  Can  you  explain  the  se-
vere disparity, and if you still believe the rise will be 13 feet? 

Answer. The indicated article was not written by me, but it quoted a figure I had 
given  in  a  speech  as  near  the  upper  end  of  the  uncertainty  range  for  the  amount 
of sea-level rise that could occur by 2100. 

There  is  no  disagreement  in  the  Earth-science  community  about  the  amount  of 
sea-level  rise  that  would  eventually  result  from  disappearance  of  the  great  ice 
sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. The answer given by the IPCC and ice experts 
everywhere  is  7  meters  (23  feet)  if  the  Greenland  ice  sheet  disappears,  another  5 
meters  (16  feet)  if  the  most  vulnerable  part  of  the  Antarctic  ice  sheet  disappears, 
and  a  total  of  about  70  meters  (230  feet)  if  the  world  got  so  warm  that  all  of  the 
Antarctic  ice  sheet  as  well  as  that  of  Greenland,  plus  all  of  the  mountain  glaciers, 
melted entirely. 

What  is  much  more  uncertain  is  how  rapidly  the  increase  in  sea  level  from  ice 
loss  could  happen,  given  warming  at  rates  projected  to  be  possible  in  this  century 
and  beyond.  The  IPCC’s  2007  report  gave  a  range  of  7  inches  to  25  inches  for  the 
amount  of  sea-level  rise  projected  for  2100,  taking  into  account  the  thermal  expan-
sion  of  a  warming  ocean  and  gradual  melting  of  mountain  glaciers  and  the  Green-
land  and  Antarctic  ice  sheets.  But  the  report  also  noted  that  phenomena  known  to 
have  occurred  in  natural  warming  periods  in  the  past  are  capable  of  causing  much 
more  rapid  disintegration  of  the  ice  sheets—and  correspondingly  faster  sea-level 
rise—which  the  IPCC  did  not  put  into  its  estimate  because  the  dynamics  of  these 
processes  are  not  yet  well  enough  understood  to  include  them  in  the  quantitative 
models. 

Scientists  who  study  the  climate  of  prehistoric  times  (using  a  variety  of  kinds  of 
evidence preserved in tree rings, ice sheets, corals, sediments, and the like) reported 
in 2005 that there were two natural warming periods in the last 19,000 years when 
these faster modes of ice-sheet disintegration raised the level of the oceans at a rate 
of as much as 2 to 5 meters (6.5 to 16 feet) per century. This was the basis of state-
ments  I  made  subsequently  to  the  effect  that  increases  in  this  range  could  not  be 
ruled out under the similarly rapid warming forecast for the 21st century. 

Studies  published  since  then  have  indicated  that  the  upper  limit  of  sea-level  rise 
to  be  expected  by  2100  is  1–2  meters.  This  remains  a  very  active  area  of  research, 
and  the  best  estimate  could  change  again,  but  since  these  latest  reports  came  out 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

102 

I have been citing the 1–2 meter (3.3 to 6.6 feet) estimate of the upper limit as the 
most up-to-date that is available. 

Question  6.  You  have  consistently  held  the  position  that  environmental  damage 
is  directly  proportional  to  economic  growth.  Are  you  of  the  position  that  we  can  no 
longer grow the economy without doing damage to the environment? 

Answer. What I have said is that environmental impact would grow in proportion 
to economic growth if ‘‘technology’’ stayed constant, where ‘‘technology’’, as explained 
in my writings about this, is shorthand for the particular mixture of goods and serv-
ices  and  technologies  for  providing  them  that  generate  the  economic  activity  re-
corded  in  GDP  and  are  also  responsible  for  the  impact  of  this  activity  on  the  envi-
ronment.  Of  course,  technology  does  not  stay  constant  over  time.  The  mix  of  goods 
and services changes and the technologies used to provide them changes. The tech-
nology factor can get better (smaller impact per dollar of GDP) if the economic mix 
becomes  less  impact-intensive  (e.g.,  less  heavy  manufacturing,  more  services)  or  if 
the  particular  technologies  used  become  environmentally  less  disruptive  per  unit  of 
good or service. It can also get worse. If we want to hold environmental impact con-
stant or reduce it as our economy grows, the only way to do so is to make sure that 
the  technology  factor  improves  at  a  rate  equal  to  or  faster  than  the  rate  at  which 
the  economy  is  growing.  This  is  one  of  the  key  reasons  it’s  so  important  to  invest 
in  science  and  technology—so  we  will  have  the  technologies  available  to  achieve 
these  improvements  at  the  needed  pace.  President  Obama  is  committed  to  seizing 
the  opportunities  presented  by  science,  engineering,  and  innovation  to  protect  the 
environment and grow the economy, and if confirmed by the Senate I will all I can 
to help in that effort. 

Question 7. What is your definition of ‘‘fear mongering?’’ 
Answer. To fear-monger is to arouse concerns about dangers one knows are imagi-
nary, or to arouse concerns out of proportion to the magnitude one believes the real 
dangers to have. It would be fear mongering to say, without evidence, that an aster-
oid is about to strike the Earth and wipe out life here. But it is not fear-mongering 
to  tell  a  home-owner  that  his/her  house  could  burn  down,  perhaps  killing  the  occu-
pants  as  well  as  destroying  the  investment,  and  that  therefore  it  would  be  wise  to 
dispose  of  the  oily  rags  in  the  garage  and  buy  some  smoke  alarms  and  some  fire 
insurance.  Nor  should  such  warnings  be  characterized  after  the  fact  as  fear 
mongering even if, in the whole tenure of the home-owner in the house, it does not 
burn down, or if it does but the smoke alarms save the occupants and the insurance 
recoups the financial loss. 

Question  8.  Specifically  list  forms  of  energy  that  you  find  acceptable  as  a  way  of 
growing  the  economy.  in  addition,  please  list  the  forms  of  energy  that  cannot  be 
used to grow the economy without destroying the environment. 

Answer.  I  have  been  saying  and  writing  for  forty  years  that  we  don’t  have  the 
luxury  of  insisting  on  perfection  in  our  energy  sources,  because  all  of  them  have  li-
abilities of one sort or another and the fact is we need energy to meet basic human 
needs and to expand and sustain economic prosperity. I think the answer is to con-
tinue  to  invest  in  research  and  development  to  improve  the  energy  sources  we  al-
ready  have  and  to  invent  additional  ones,  in  order  to  have  the  best  portfolio  of  op-
tions  possible  at  any  given  time,  and  then  to  let  the  marketplace,  as  modified  by 
policy  and  other  manifestations  of  the  public’s  wishes,  choose  the  mix  that  will  be 
used. 

I wrote in 1971 that I thought we’d find the quickest, least expensive, least envi-
ronmentally  disruptive  energy  source  for  the  decades  ahead  to  be  increased  energy 
efficiency—using  lights,  appliances,  building  envelopes,  cars,  airplanes,  and  manu-
facturing processes that deliver more product or service for less energy—so that the 
energy saved could be used elsewhere in the economy. That proved to be true. From 
1970  to  2005  the  amount  of  primary  energy  needed  to  make  a  real  dollar  of  GDP 
in the United States fell two-fold. This meant that more energy was made available 
to  our  economy  in  this  period  from  these  savings  than  was  provided  by  the  expan-
sion of all other energy sources combined. I believe that this will continue to be true 
for at least the next few decades, as well. 

But  efficiency  improvements  cannot  do  the  whole  job.  Even  compact  fluorescent 
bulbs  and  LED  lighting  still  use  electricity,  and  the  most  fuel-efficient  hybrids  on 
the  road  still  use  hydrocarbon  or  alcohol  fuels.  We  will  continue  to  need  a  portfolio 
of  ways  to  provide  electricity,  portable  fuels,  and  heat.  I  think  that,  for  the  imme-
diate future, the ingredients of that portfolio will need to continue to include: 

• petroleum-derived  fuels  for  our  motor  vehicles  and  aircraft  especially,  but  with 
due attention to reducing the ecosystem impacts of getting those fuels domesti-
cally,  the  foreign-policy  liabilities  and  economic  vulnerabilities  of  getting  them 
abroad, and the emissions from burning them;

• biofuels derived from currently practical as well as new feedstocks in ways that 
reduce  petroleum  dependence  and  greenhouse-gas  emissions  while  minimizing 
competition with food production and destruction of forests; 

• natural  gas,  which  is  the  cleanest-burning  and  least  CO2-intensive  of  all  of  the 
fossil fuels, as well as the one most conducive to electricity generation and com-
bined  heat  and  power  (CHP)  at  high  efficiency  and  relatively  low  capital  cost; 
• coal,  from  which  more  than  half  of  U.S.  electricity  currently  comes,  but  which 
is also our most environmentally disruptive energy source and warrants efforts 
to  move  as  rapidly  as  practicable  toward  less  damaging  ways  of  mining  it  and 
toward  the  capacity  to  capture  and  sequester  away  from  the  atmosphere  most 
of the CO2 that would otherwise be released from burning it; 

• nuclear  energy,  currently  accounting  for  20  percent  of  U.S.  electricity  supply,  a 
proportion that could be expanded with the benefit of reduced emissions of CO2 
and criteria air pollutants; 
• hydropower, for which the best sites for large installations in the United States 
are  mostly  already  in  use,  but  which  has  additional  potential  in  small-hydro 
and  run-of-river  installations  with  due  attention  to  minimizing  environmental 
impacts; 

• wind power, which is currently the least expensive of the ‘‘new renewables’’ for 
electricity generation and also has arguably the lowest environmental impact of 
any  of  the  currently  available  electricity-generating  technologies  (although  still 
not zero, as objections on grounds of visual intrusion and impacts on birds and 
bats demonstrate). 

Other energy sources of promise that we should be working to develop or improve 
in terms of their competitiveness include hot-dry-rock geothermal energy, solar-ther-
mal  electricity  generation,  solar-photovoltaic  electricity  generation,  direct  solar  pro-
duction  of  hydrogen,  energy  from  ocean  currents  and  waves,  and  fusion.  I  believe 
that President Obama’s plan to invest $150 billion over 10 years in improving exist-
ing  energy  sources  and  developing  new  ones  will  be  a  great  boost  in  getting  us 
where we need to go. 

Energy  sources  I  think  would  be  problematic  to  increase  significantly  in  connec-
tion with fueling U.S. economic growth, because of the environmental or security im-
pacts of such expansion, include: 

not designed to be retrofitted to do so; 

• oil  imports  from  politically  unstable  regions  and  from  countries  that  use  their 
oil-import  revenues  for  purposes  inimical  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States; 
• new  coal-burning  power  plants  that  do  not  capture  and  sequester  CO2 and  are 
• coal-to-liquids and other synfuels technologies that do not use CO2 capture and 
sequestration  to  achieve  at  least  neutrality  in  ‘‘well-to-wheels’’  CO2 emissions 
compared to gasoline produced from crude petroleum; 
• biofuels  technologies  that  compete  directly  with  food  production  and  thus  drive 
up food prices, or that result in deforestation or other forms of land-use change 
that lead to net increases in CO2 emissions; 

Question  9.  Do  you  believe  California  has  been  a  good  model  for  cap-and-trade, 
and  how  are  low-income  families  affected  by  the  cost  of  energy?  In  addition,  what 
are  your  thoughts  on  the  statement  that  ‘‘economic  development  is  the  key  to 
human well-being?’’ 

Answer. California’s cap-and-trade policies, which are part of a bill passed by the 
California legislature in 2006 (AB32), will not go into effect until 2012. The program 
is designed to return California to 1990 emissions levels by 2020, which is the same 
figure  as  mentioned  by  President  Obama  during  the  campaign  as  a  prospective  in-
termediate goal for the country as a whole. The President has also made clear that 
he favors a cap-and-trade approach to emissions reductions, but the extent to which 
the  details  of  the  Federal  approach  do  or  do  not  resemble  those  of  the  California 
plan  remains  to  be  worked  out  by  the  administration  in  concert  with  the  Congress. 
Of  course,  charging  a  price  for  emitting  CO2 will  necessarily  increase  the  cost  of 
using  fossil  fuels.  But  this  will  not  necessarily  increase  the  overall  cost  of  energy 
services,  because  higher  fossil  fuel  prices  will  motivate  increased  private  invest-
ments in energy-efficiency improvements that will save money at the higher energy 
prices  by  reducing  the  amount  of  energy  needed  to  deliver  a  given  service  and  be-
cause  part  of  the  revenues  from  auctioning  the  emission  permits  is  likely  to  be  in-
vested  by  the  government  in  additional  energy-efficiency  programs  that  will  have 
similar effects.

As  a  general  matter,  poor  people  are  the  most  vulnerable  segment  of  our  society 
to  increases  in  energy  costs.  That  vulnerability  can  be  reduced,  however,  with  pro-
gressive  rate  structures  ensuring  that  any  overall  price  increases  are  born  mainly 
by the larger users and by devoting a part of permit revenues to programs that pro-
vide insulation, energy-efficient windows, compact fluorescent bulbs, and the like to 
poor people. 

I  certainly  believe  that  economic  development  is  one  of  the  keys  to  improving 
human well-being. I have been emphatic in my writings and speeches over the years 
that  human  well-being  rests  on  a  foundation  of  three  pillars—economic,  environ-
mental,  and  sociopolitical  (where  the  last  includes  national  and  personal  security, 
personal freedoms, access to a working system of justice, etc.). It is my position that 
all  three  pillars  are  indispensable,  in  the  same  sense  that  a  three-legged  stool  falls 
down  if  any  one  leg  fails.  It  is  therefore  important  to  be  sure  that,  in  seeking  to 
strengthen any one of the legs, we do not do so in ways that seriously weaken either 
one  of  the  others.  That  is  a  challenge  to  which  science  and  technology  have  much 
to contribute. 

Question 10. In regards to malaria deaths, how many people have died of malaria 

globally since banning DDT for the use of malaria suppression? 

Answer.  Malaria  remains  a  terrible  scourge  across  much  of  the  world’s  tropical 
and subtropical area, killing 900,000 people per year. But I don’t believe lack of use 
of  DDT  has  been  a  significant  contributor  to  our  failure  to  better  control  this  dis-
ease.  Under  the  international  agreement  governing  DDT  use—the  Stockholm  Con-
vention  on  Persistent  Organic  Pollutants—governments  believing  that  they  need 
DDT  for  malaria  control  can  and  do  get  exemptions  to  use  it,  and  they  are  not  ex-
pected  to  stop  using  it  until  they  are  satisfied  that  alternatives  are  workable  for 
their specific needs. 

The World Health Organization’s attempt in the 1950s and 1960s to eradicate ma-
laria  with  a  massive  DDT-spraying  program  did  help  to  control  malaria  for  a  time, 
but  it  ultimately  failed  mainly  because  many  species  of  mosquito  around  the  world 
evolved resistance to DDT. This plus growing evidence of harm to humans and other 
animals  from  DDT  and  its  breakdown  products  led  most  countries  to  give  up  DDT 
use  for  malaria  control  in  favor  of  integrated  approaches  combining  elimination  of 
mosquito  breeding  sites,  biological  controls,  spraying  of  alternative  chemicals,  and 
early  detection  and  prompt  treatment  of  malaria  cases.  The  plan  that  President 
Obama  has  announced  to  eliminate  the  scourge  of  malaria  worldwide  by  2015  en-
tails  working  in  partnership  with  developing  countries,  donor  nations,  and  private 
and non-profit organizations to achieve universal access to these proven, integrated 
approaches to prevention and treatment 

Question 11. Do you still support government funded sterilization as a useful tool 

for de-development of industrialized economies? 

Answer.  I  have  never  supported  government-funded  sterilization.  The  term  ‘‘de- 
development’’  was  used  by  me  and  some  of  my  co-authors  for  a  few  years  in  the 
1970s but then abandoned as unhelpful. At the time, further development in the in-
dustrialized  nations  was  seen  as  entailing  large  increases  in  emissions  of  toxic  and 
climate-altering  substances,  habitat  destruction,  extinction  of  species,  and 
unsustainable  practices  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  forestry.  My  co-authors  and  I 
explained  that  by  ‘‘de-development’’  we  meant  scaling  back  these  harmful  practices 
by,  for  example,  reducing  per-capita  energy  use  through  improvements  in  energy 
end-use  efficiency,  doing  the  same  with  water  use,  and  making  products  that  last 
longer  and  are  designed  for  easy  recycle.  The  term  I  have  lately  been  using  in  dis-
cussing  what  I  think  we  should  be  aiming  for  in  these  and  related  respects  is  not 
‘‘de-development’’ but ‘‘sustainable prosperity.’’ 

Question 12. One of the few guarantees of climate change legislation is that if will 
increase  the  cost  of  electricity  to  consumers  and  energy  to  industry.  How  does  this 
create jobs and at what point is an increase in the cost of electricity on low-income 
families unacceptable? 

Answer. As discussed in my answer to question 9, above, measures to reduce the 
emissions of CO2 will initially increase the unit costs of electricity and fuel, but re-
sponses to these increases are likely to include energy-efficiency improvements that 
reduce  the  amount  of  electricity  or  fuel  needed  to  provide  a  given  service,  thus  re-
ducing  the  adverse  economic  impact  on  the  consumer.  Impacts  on  low-income  fami-
lies  can  be  ameliorated  through  utility  (electricity  and  natural  gas)  rate  structures 
and through programs that use some of the revenues from the sale of emissions per-
mits to help the poor with energy-saving investments. 

Creating  economic  incentives  to  reduce  greenhouse-gas  emissions  by  charging  for 
emissions  permits  will  stimulate  investment  in  research,  development,  demonstra-
tion, and deployment of improved and new technologies both for using energy more

efficiently in the production of the goods and services that people want and for pro-
viding electricity and fuel in ways that emit less greenhouse gases than today’s en-
ergy-supply technologies do. These investments will lead to the creation of new jobs 
and the founding of new businesses, just as control of conventional air pollution and 
water  pollution  starting  in  the  1970s  led  ultimately  to  a  set  of  environmental-  pro-
tection businesses that today generate hundreds of billions of dollars of annual rev-
enue in this country. 

Question  13.  Dr.  Holdren,  you  have  made  a  number  of  astonishingly  dire  pre-
dictions  over  the  past  four  decades  of  approaching  environmental  catastrophes  that 
would lead to widespread human suffering and death. Have any of these predictions 
come  true?  Why  do  you  think  that  is?  Do  you  think  that  any  of  your  predictions 
are  still  likely  to  come  true  in  the  future?  Which  ones?  Do  you  think  it  would  be 
advisable  to  base  important  public  policies  on  any  of  these  predictions  or  on  simi-
larly  wild-eyed  predictions  that  you  may  develop  while  serving  as  White  House 
science, not science fiction, adviser? 

Answer. Statements I have made about dangers from nuclear weapons, pressures 
on  supplies  of  food  and  water,  pollution,  and  impacts  of  climate  change  have  been 
intended  not  as  predictions  but  as  projections  about  where  we  were  heading  and, 
thus, why it would be a good idea to change course in ways that would reduce these 
dangers.  To  the  extent  that  some  of  the  potential  harm  identified  in  these  projec-
tions  has  not  yet  happened  or  has  not  happened  to  the  degree  I  said  was  possible, 
I  believe  this  is  at  least  partly  because  society  did  take  construction  actions  to  re-
duce the dangers. (I listed a number of those constructive actions, including a num-
ber  of  environmental  laws  passed  by  the  U.S.  Congress  and  signed  into  law  by  six 
U.S.  presidents  of  both  parties,  in  my  answers  to  the  pre-hearing  questions.)  I  be-
lieve  that  identifying  possible  adverse  outcomes  of  actions  taken  or  not  taken,  as 
well  as  identifying  and  analyzing  appropriate  strategies  for  reducing  the  dangers, 
is  as  appropriate  in  the  domain  of  science  and  technology  policy  as  it  is  in  the  do-
main  of  economic  policy,  and  if  confirmed  by  the  Senate  as  Director  of  the  Office 
of Science and Technology Policy I would take this responsibility seriously. 

Question 14. Dr. Holdren, you have been a tireless advocate for drastic reductions 
in population. You have also advocated de-development and reductions in the stand-
ard  of  living  in  the  developed  economies.  Do  you  favor  mandatory  government-en-
forced  reductions  in  population  in  this  or  any  other  country?  Have  you  ever  com-
mended  China’s  one-child  policy?  1  assume  you  support  abortion.  Have  you  also 
commended  Dutch-style  euthanasia  policies?  Do  you  welcome  the  financial  crisis 
and  economic  recession  as  a  way  to  accomplish  your  goals  of  de-development  and 
lower living standards? Why not? 

Answer.  Actually,  I  have  written  relatively  little  on  population  issues  since  the 
1970s.  I  do  not  favor  government-enforced  reductions  in  population  in  the  United 
States  or  elsewhere.  I  do  not  favor  the  harsh  measures  employed  in  China  in  favor 
of  that  country’s  one-child-per-family  policy.  I  do  not  favor  euthanasia.  I  am  ap-
palled  by  the  current  financial  crisis  because  of  its  adverse  impacts  on  the  well- 
being of U.S. citizens and people around the world. My use of the term ‘‘de-develop-
ment’’ three decades ago was in the context of aspects of economic growth, as it was 
then  being  pursued,  that  were  causing  considerable  harm.  As  indicated  in  my  an-
swers  to  pre-hearing  questions,  I  concluded  long  ago  that  the  term  was  poorly  cho-
sen, and I have ever since been using the terms ‘‘sustainable development’’ and ‘‘sus-
tainable  prosperity’’  to  convey  what  I  think  we  should  be  trying  to  achieve.  My  in-
terest in the interaction of science and technology with the human condition has al-
ways been to try to ensure that science and technology are used to increase the sum 
of  human  well-being,  taking  into  account  well-being’s  environmental  and  socio-
political aspects as well as its economic aspect. I wish anyone who doubts this would 
read  my  2007  Presidential  address  for  the  American  Association  for  the  Advance-
ment  of  Science,  ‘‘Science  and  Technology  for  Sustainable  Well-Being″,  which  was 
published  in  the  25  January  2008  edition  of  SCIENCE  and  is  available  online  at 
http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/319/5862/424. 

Question 15. Dr. Holdren, you are a man of strong political convictions. It appears 
that  you  have  often  put  your  scientific  position  and  expertise  in  the  service  of  your 
political  commitments.  It  appears  that  you  have  sometimes  forced  the  science  to  fit 
your  agenda.  Don’t  you  think  this  disqualifies  you  for  the  roles  of  WH  science  ad-
viser and director of OSTP? The science adviser is charged with providing the Presi-
dent  with  objective  and  useful  scientific  information  and  analysis  to  inform  policy 
choices.  The  OSTP  serves  as  a  conduit  for  the  entire  scientific  community,  not  just 
one  politically-engaged  part  of  it,  to  share  its  knowledge  and  views  and  concerns 
with  the  administration.  The  science  adviser  and  OSTP  director  is  not  supposed  to 
push a policy agenda or to fit or cherry pick the scientific facts and evidence to sup-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:35 May 12, 2010 Jkt 051471 PO 00000 Frm 00109 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\51471.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

106 

port  a  particular  agenda.  Do  you  think  that  a  person  of  such  strong  political  com-
mitments as you have can check those commitments at the door? If so, do you think 
that  some  of  the  scientists  you  have  attacked  and  criticized  would  be  able  to  check 
their  views  at  the  door  if  they  were  nominated  to  serve  as  science  adviser.  For  ex-
ample, Professor Richard S. Lindzen of MIT has much more professional competence 
as  a  climate  scientist  than  you  do.  In  fact,  I  note  that  you  are  not  a  climate  sci-
entist.  Professor  Lindzen  has  published  many  highly  regarded  papers  in  atmos-
pheric physics and has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences for ap-
proximately  thirty  years.  He  has  also  commented  on  the  public  policy  debate  on 
global warming, although he has never promoted a political agenda in the way you 
have. Do you think Professor Lindzen is qualified to be White House science adviser 
and director of OSTP? Would you support his confirmation if he were nominated at 
some point in the future? 

Answer.  With  respect,  I  disagree  with  the  question’s  characterization  of  how  I 
have conducted myself over my four-decade career working on issues of science and 
technology  as  they  affect  public  policy.  My  policy  preferences  on  issues  where  in-
sights  from  science  and  technology  are  germane  have  been  shaped  by  my  under-
standing  of  the  relevant  science  and  technology,  not  the  other  way  around.  (That 
is  not  to  say  that  insights  from  science  and  technology  always  tell  us  what  policies 
to  prefer;  more  often  than  not  they  do  not  suffice  for  that.  But  they  do  often  tell 
us something about what policy needs to achieve or to avoid.) 

As  to  whether  I  am  a  climate  scientist,  the  question  appears  to  embody  a  rather 
narrow  definition  of  what  a  climate  scientist  is.  I  do  not  have  a  degree  in  meteor-
ology, but I do hold a tenured full professorship in one of the leading university de-
partments of Earth Science in the world. I have two degrees in aeronautics and as-
tronautics  from  MIT  in  which  my  major  fields  of  study  were  fluid  dynamics  and 
aerospace engineering, and a PhD from Stanford that included further study of fluid 
dynamics  and  a  doctoral  thesis  on  theoretical  plasma  physics.  Fluid  dynamics  is 
what  governs  the  motions  of  the  atmosphere.  The  mathematics  of  plasma  physics 
is  very  similar  to  the  mathematics  used  in  modeling  the  Earth’s  climate.  I  have 
been  teaching  environmental  science,  including  the  science  of  climate  change,  for 
more than 35 years at Caltech, the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard, 
and I have been publishing peer-reviewed articles and reports about the causes and 
consequences of climate change, and the remedies for it, for even longer. 

While I am not willing to engage, in this venue, in a comparison of my qualifica-
tions to be Director of OSTP with those of others, I will note that I am a long-time 
member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of En-
gineering, a Fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Academy of 
Arts  and  Sciences,  and  a  former  President  and  Chair  of  the  Board  of  the  American 
Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science  (elected  by  the  membership  of  this,  the 
largest  general  science  society  in  the  world  and  the  publisher  of  the  journal 
SCIENCE). I believe I was nominated by President Obama to serve as his Assistant 
for Science and Technology and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy  not  only  because  of  my  knowledge  of  and  contributions  to  the  issue  of  climate 
change  (although  that  is  certainly  one  of  the  important  science  and  technology 
issues  facing  this  administration  and  this  country)  but  also  because  of  my  experi-
ence with a variety of other environmental issues; with nuclear and nonnuclear en-
ergy technologies; with space science and technology; with nuclear weapons, nuclear 
arms  control,  and  nonproliferation;  with  international  cooperation  in  science  and 
technology;  and  with  the  study  and  practice  of  how  science  and  technology  policy 
work in the White House. 

Question  16.  Dr.  Holdren,  you  have  been  dismissive  and  have  sometimes  sneered 
at  the  views  of  highly  qualified  professional  climate  scientists,  who  are  often  de-
scribed in the media as climate skeptics, and even though you are not a climate sci-
entist.  People  such  as  Professor  Richard  Lindzen  of  MIT,  Professor  John  Christy  of 
the  University  of  Alabama  at  Huntsville,  Dr.  Roy  Spencer  of  the  University  of  Ala-
bama  at  Huntsville,  Professor  Patrick  Michaels  of  the  University  of  Virginia,  and 
Professor  Emeritus  and  former  director  of  the  U  S.  Weather  Service  Fred  Singer. 
Have  you  ever  called  any  of  these  distinguished  scientists  (or  any  scientists  I 
haven’t named) ‘‘deniers’’, thereby implying that they are somehow similar to Holo-
caust  deniers,  simply  because  they  have  expressed  views  you  disagree  with.  If  you 
are confirmed, what evidence can you offer that you would be able to consider fairly 
and to represent their expert views? Will you continue to denigrate expert scientific 
views  you  disagree  with  and  the  scientists  who  hold  them  while  serving  President 
Obama? 

Answer.  I  would  not  say  I  have  ‘‘sneered’’  at  the  views  of  any  of  the  individuals 
named in the question, although I have certainly disagreed publicly with a number 
of specific arguments that some of these individuals have advanced. Most of the in-

dividuals named do not deny that climate change is occurring or that human activi-
ties  have  something  to  do  with  it,  but  rather  take  the  view  that  the  uncertainties 
are  larger  and  the  most  likely  consequences  smaller  than  what  most  climate  sci-
entists believe to be the case. In the rare instance that one finds a climate scientist 
of  any  sort  who  actually  denies  that  human  activities  are  changing  the  climate  of 
the  Earth,  I  would  say  that  the  term  ‘‘climate-change  denier’’  is  accurate  without 
imputing  any  similarity  or  relationship  to  those  who  deny  the  reality  of  the  Holo-
caust. These are very different kinds of denial. 

Question 17. Dr. Holdren, you have made many strong claims about global warm-
ing  and  its  impacts.  Rather  than  listing  those  claims,  can  you  provide  evidence  for 
some  of  them?  You  have  stated  that  global  warming  is  accelerating  and  happening 
faster than predicted. Can you show any satellite or surface global temperature data 
sets  that  support  your  claim?  Are  you  aware  of  any  data  sets  that  do  not  support 
your  claim?  What  criteria  have  you  applied  to  prefer  one  temperature  data  set  to 
another?  You  have  stated  that  the  impacts  of  global  warming  are  already  apparent 
and worse than predicted Can you comment on some of these? For example sea level 
rise.  What  is  your  view?  Is  it  supported  by  the  IPCC’s  Fourth  Assessment  Report? 
For  example,  you  have  claimed  that  droughts,  Moods,  and  storms  are  also  increas-
ing  as  a  result  of  global  warming.  What  professional  expertise  has  allowed  you  to 
pick  out  and  prefer  a  few  studies  that  support  your  claim  out  of  the  many  studies 
that do not? Since you are not a climate scientist, you may not be aware of the sci-
entific literature that does not support your alarmist views. Therefore, we would be 
happy  to  share  some  of  those  studies  with  you  and  invite  your  comments  on  them. 
Answer. The question mentions the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. It is a fine 
compilation  of  much  of  the  evidence  for  the  statements  I  have  made  about  global 
climate change and its impacts. 

Where  the  question  implies  that  the  IPCC  Fourth  Assessment  does  not  support 
what  I  have  said  (namely,  about  the  potential  extent  of  sea-level  rise  in  the  21st 
century),  I  have  already  explained  in  my  written  answers  to  pre-hearing  questions, 
as well as in the oral Q&A portion of my hearing, that the IPCC report itself makes 
clear that the authors chose to present quantitative estimates only for those contrib-
uting phenomena that they felt could be modeled reasonably accurately at the time 
they  wrote.  This  excluded  the  mechanisms  for  rapid  ice  sheet  disintegration  that 
paleoclimatological studies have indicated were responsible for rates of sea level rise 
of  2  to  5  meters  (6.6  to  16  feet)  per  century  during  natural  warming  periods  in  the 
past 20,000 years (see R. B. Alley et al., Science, 310: 456–460, 2005; J. T. Overpeck 
et al., Science 311: 1747–50, 2006). The IPCC authors actually made clear that their 
lower  figures,  which  included  only  thermal  expansion  of  sea  water  and  the  gradual 
melting of land ice, were neither a ‘‘best estimate’’ nor an ‘‘upper bound’’ of sea-level 
to be expected by 2100 because of the exclusion of the faster mechanisms from their 
quantitative analysis. As I indicated in my earlier answers, a series of studies pub-
lished  since  the  IPCC  report  was  finalized  suggest  that  the  best  current  estimate 
of  the  maximum  sea-level  rise  to  be  expected  by  2100  is  1–2  meters,  i.e,  3.3  to  6.6 
feet (see, e.g., S. Rahmstorf, Science 315: 368–370, 2007; W. T. Pfeffer et al., Science 
321: 1340–43, 2008, and references therein). 

In addition to the reports of the IPCC, accessible accounts of the evidence for the 
character  and  impacts  of  global  climate  change,  with  extensive  references  to  the 
peer-reviewed scientific literature, can be found in the reports on the subject of the 
U.N. Scientific Expert Group on Climate Change and Sustainable Development, for 
which  I  was  one  of  the  coordinating  lead  authors  (www.unfoundation.org/SEG/); 
the  U.S.  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (http://dels.nas.edulglobalchange);  the  U.S. 
National  Center  for  Atmospheric  Research  (www.ucar.edu);  and  the  U.K.  Meteoro-
logical  Office  (www.met-office.gov.uk),  as  well  as  on  a  myriad  of  websites  run  by 
(e.g.,  www.columbia.edu/∼jeh1/, 
some  of 
stephenschneider.stanford.edu, www.realclimate.org).

Besides these relatively comprehensive accounts of the scientific evidence relating 
to  climate  change  and  its  impacts,  I  offer  the  following  as  recent  substantiation,  in 
the  peer-reviewed  literature,  of  what  I  have  characterized  as  the  ‘‘mainstream’’  or 
‘‘center  of  gravity’’  position  on  specific  points  to  which  the  question  calls  attention:

I  do  not  agree  with  the  question’s  suggestion  that  only  a  few  studies  support  my 
characterizations  of  current  understandings  in  climate  science  while  many  do  not. 
Indeed,  I  believe  that  the  opposite  is  true,  at  least  if  one  confines  attention  to  the 
peer-reviewed scientific literature. 

Of course, one does not determine what is most likely to be correct only by count-
ing up the numbers of scientific papers on each side of an issue; if one has the back-
ground  needed  to  do  so,  one  reads  the  analyses,  examines  the  data  and  the  argu-
ments,  and  tries  to  reach  a  reasoned  conclusion  about  which  findings  should  be 
taken  most  seriously.  In  every  scientific  field,  many  things  make  it  into  the  peer- 
reviewed literature that subsequently are shown to be incorrect. (This was the case 
with  some  of  the  early  interpretations  of  satellite  data  on  tropospheric  tempera-
tures, appearing to show a cooling rather than the expected warming.) That is why 
it  is  so  important  to  stay  up  to  date,  and  also  why  the  reports  of  the  National  Re-
search  Council  and  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change—in  which 
leaders  in  the  field  devote  great  effort  to  sorting  out  the  science  that  stands  up  to 
scrutiny from the science that does not—have such high credibility. 

Question  18.  Dr.  Holdren,  on  global  warming  and  several  other  scientific  issues 
with  important  public  policy  consequences,  your  views  in  my  opinion  are  not  well 
supported in the expert scientific literature and in fact have been described, perhaps 
uncharitably,  as  being  on  the  kooky  fringe.  As  scientific  adviser,  how  will  you  put 
aside your own non-mainstream personal views and represent mainstream scientific 
views  on  global  warming  and  other  scientific  topics  that  have  serious  ramifications 
for public policy? 

Answer.  As  indicated  in  the  preceding  answer,  I  do  not  agree  with  the  question’s 
premise  that  my  views  on  climate-change  science  are  not  well  supported  in  the  ex-
pert  scientific  literature  and  that  they  differ  from  mainstream  scientific  views  on 
the  topic.  I  consider  the  mainstream  views  to  be  those  presented  in  the  reviews  of 
climate science issued by the National Research Council and the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change and summarized periodically in statements issued by, e.g., 
the  presidents  of  the  national  academies  of  science  of  most  of  the  countries  that 
have  such  academies,  the  leaderships  of  the  principal  professional  societies  dealing 
in  the  physical  and  Earth  sciences,  and  so  on.  (A  compilation  of  those  statements 
is available at http://www.logicalscience.com/consensus/consensusD1.htm.) 

I  believe  it  would  be  my  responsibility  as  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  and 
Technology,  if  confirmed  by  the  U.S.  Senate,  to  communicate  to  the  President  and 
others the content of these mainstream views as well as the range of scientific opin-
ion  diverging  from  the  mainstream,  in  both  the  more  optimistic  and  more  pessi-
mistic  directions,  and  my  best  judgment  about  the  implications  for  policy  of  the 
ranges of disagreement and uncertainty that exist. As in other subject areas, in de-
veloping these formulations I would expect to draw upon the insights and judgments 
of experts on the OSTP staff, on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and 
Technology, in cabinet departments and other Federal agencies as appropriate, and 
across the wider science and technology communities. 

Question  19.  Dr.  Holdren,  during  your  nomination  hearing  you  mentioned  that 
you  still  believe  one  billion  people  will  die  from  global  warming  by  2020.  You  also 
mentioned that in your scientific predictions you have ‘‘hedged your bets’’ and ‘‘were 
within  the  scientific  feeling  at  that  time.’’  When  you  advise  the  President  do  you 
plan on ‘‘hedging your bets’’ and going with the ‘‘feeling at the time?’’

Answer.  With  respect,  I  did  not  say  I  believe  a  billion  people  will  die  from  the 
impacts of climate change by 2020; I said I believe such a terrible outcome remains 
possible,  and  I  explained  that  the  way  this  could  come  about  would  be  if  global  cli-
mate  crossed  a  tipping  point  into  a  climate  regime  that  drastically  reduced  world 
food production. (On climate tipping points and their possible imminence, please see, 
e.g.,  Lenton,  T.  M.,  et  al.,  Proceedings  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  105(6): 
1786–1793,  2008;  on  the  vulnerability  of  world  food  production  to  climate  change, 
please  see,  e.g.,  Lobell,  D.  L.,  et  al.,  Science  319,  607–610,  2008,  and  D.  S.  Battisti 
and R. L. Naylor, Science 323: 240244, 2009.) 

More  generally,  the  future  being  inherently  uncertain,  all  statements  about  it 
should  be  ‘‘hedged’’;  that  is,  the  uncertainty  should  be  acknowledged,  and  the  as-
sumptions  on  which  particular  projections  or  scenarios  are  based  should  be  stated. 
I have always tried to do that, although this is not necessarily apparent when some-
one quotes a single sentence or part of a sentence out of context. I have also always 
tried to base my statements about trends and associated risks on the best scientific 
information  and  judgments  available  at  the  time.  (If,  in  the  press  of  oral  Q&A  at 
my  hearing,  I  ended  up  saying  ‘‘scientific  feeling’’  rather  than  ‘‘scientific  under-
standing’’ or ‘‘scientific judgment’’, I regret the imprecision.) Of course, scientific in-
formation  gets  better  as  time  goes  on,  and  I  hope  that  my  capacity  to  assess  such 
information—and to draw upon others to help me assess it—has also improved over 
time.
