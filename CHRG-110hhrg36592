3. Hearing Issues

• Impact of Bayh-Dole. What has been the impact of the current implementa-
tion of Bayh-Dole on federally funded university research, and the technology
transfer and commercialization of that research?

• University-Industry  Relations.  How  has  Bayh-Dole  shaped  university-in-
dustry  research  collaboration?  Are  there  differences  in  interpretation  of  the
statute and regulations by universities and industry? Are there differences in
the impact across industry sectors, or for large and small businesses?

• Impact  of  Globalization.  What  is  the  possible  effect  of  the  increasing
globalization  of  research?  Are  U.S.  companies  turning  to  foreign  universities
for  research  collaboration?  How  do  the  intellectual  property  and  business
practices  at  U.S.  universities  compare  to  universities  in  other  developed  and
developing countries?

• Impact  on  Universities  and  Innovation.  Has  Bayh-Dole  influenced  basic
university  research,  academic  collaboration  and  the  broad  dissemination  of
knowledge? In what ways does the law promote innovation; has it created any
barriers?

• Legislation.  What  changes  in  Bayh-Dole  legislation,  if  any,  may  be  appro-
priate as we look to the next 25 years, to promote innovation, commercializa-
tion of federally funded research, and U.S. economic development?

4. Background—Bayh-Dole Legislation

P.L. 96–517, Amendments to the Patent and Trademark Act of 1980, commonly re-
ferred to as Bayh-Dole, promoted the utilization of inventions arising from federally
supported  research  and  development.  Bayh-Dole  had  other  important  policy  objec-
tives including (emphasis added):

• to encourage maximum participation of small business firms in federally

supported research and development efforts;

• to promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit orga-

nizations, including universities;

• to ensure that inventions made by nonprofit organizations and small busi-
ness  firms  are  used  in  a  manner  to  promote  free  competition  and  enter-
prise without unduly encumbering future research and discovery;

• to  promote  the  commercialization  and  public  availability  of  inventions

made in the U.S. by U.S. industry and labor;

• to ensure that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally sup-
ported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect the pub-
lic against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.

The  legislation  was  motivated  by  a  number  of  concerns  in  the  1970s.  The  U.S.
lacked  a  uniform  patent  policy  for  federally  funded  research,  and  inventions  from
this  research  were  not  leading  to  commercial  products  and  services.  The  Federal
Government retained title to the inventions and licensed technology on a non-exclu-
sive  basis,  providing  insufficient  incentive  to  make  the  sizable  investment  required
to commercialize early stage, high-risk technologies.

Under  Bayh-Dole,  a  uniform  technology  transfer  policy  was  created  along  with
new  incentives  for  commercialization.  Non-profit  organizations,  including  univer-
sities,  and  small  businesses,  could  take  title  to  inventions  based  upon  federally
funded R&D, and license technology to companies with exclusive licenses.

The  broader  economic  conditions  were  also  important  factor  shaping  Bayh-Dole.
The U.S. economy was in a recession, productivity was declining, and the U.S. faced
growing competition internationally from Germany and Japan. Promoting university
based innovation and technology transfer to industry was seen as an important pol-
icy lever to counter these developments.
5. Hearing Issues
Impact of Bayh-Dole. The impact of Bayh-Dole can be measured in terms of tech-
nology  innovation  (patent  disclosures  and  application),  licenses  granted,  and  new
company spin-offs. It can also be measured in financial returns to the university to
support further research and new jobs created in the region.

According to the most recent published survey for FY 20051 from the Association
of  University  Technology  Managers  (AUTM)  of  their  membership,  4,932  new  li-
censes  were  signed  in  2005  with  28,349  active  licenses.  527  new  products  were  in-
troduced in 2005 from 151 organizations, and cumulatively 3,641 new products were
introduced  between  FY98  through  FY05.  628  new  spinoff  companies  were  created
in 2005; 5,171 since 1980.

In 2005, technology transfer offices received 17,382 invention disclosures and filed
9,536 patent applications of which 69.9 percent were provisional applications which
gave a one year opportunity to test company interest before filing a full utility appli-
cation.  Technology  transfer  offices  licensed  primarily  to  startups  (12.7  percent),
small  companies  (50.2  percent),  and  large  companies  (30.9  percent).  37  percent  of
total licenses and options reported in the survey were exclusive licenses.

However,  the  financial  returns  to  universities  from  licensing  or  equity  positions
in spin-off companies are highly concentrated. Of 141 universities with licensing in-
come  in  1999  and  2000,  22  universities  received  almost  80  percent  of  the  income
and five universities received over 45 percent of the licensing income.2 This pattern
has  resulted  in  some  universities  taking  a  broader  view  of  the  appropriate  metrics
of technology transfer activity to include regional economic development.

University-Industry  Relations.  Bayh-Dole  has  also  shaped  university-industry
research  collaboration  in  areas  beyond  direct  licensing.  Industry  collaborates  with
universities across a wide spectrum of activities from the exchange of ideas and re-
searchers  to  transactions  involving  intellectual  property.  There  is  a  perception  that
Bayh-Dole has broadly influenced these activities.

Much  of  university  licensing  activity  is  focused  on  biotechnology  where  there  is
potentially  larger  financial  return  to  the  university,  or  at  least  the  potential  for
some  ‘‘big  wins.’’  In  fact,  the  Biotechnology  industry  traces  its  explosive  growth  to
three events in 1980: the Supreme Court decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty (find-
ing  that  Congress  had  intended  patentable  subject  matter  to  ‘‘include  anything
under  the  sun  that  is  made  by  man’’),  Bayh-Dole,  and  P.L.  96–480,  the  Stevenson-
Wydler  Technology  Innovation  Act  of  1980,  which  covers  technology  transfer  from
federal laboratories.
Impact of Globalization. In  the  late  1970s,  the  U.S.  faced  increasing  competition
from Germany and Japan. Today, globalization is a much broader force with the in-
creasing globalization of not only manufacturing and services, but research activities
as  well.  U.S.  companies  are  beginning  to  turn  to  foreign  universities  for  research
collaboration. This is in part driven by difference in business practices between U.S.
and foreign universities and the opportunity for greater control of intellectual prop-
erty. Agreements can be reached in days to weeks compared to what can be months
and years in the U.S.
Impact on Universities and Innovation. There have been concerns raised about
the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole  on  the  broad  university  research  enterprise  as  well  as  the
role  of  universities  in  the  dissemination  of  knowledge.  In  particular,  with  Bayh-
Dole’s  focus  on  ‘‘downstream’’  commercialization  of  research,  there  is  concern  that
there  is  a  negative  impact  on  collaboration  and  innovation  ‘‘upstream’’  in  basic  re-
search.3

Recently,  several  universities  and  the  Association  of  American  Medical  Colleges
(AAMC) released a white paper, ‘‘In the Public Interest: Nine Points to Consider in
Licensing  University  Technology.’’ 4 The  paper  captures  shared  perspectives  of  the
participating university research officers and licensing directors on policy issues re-
lated to university technology transfer, in particular, when universities license tech-
nologies  ‘‘in  the  public  interest  and  for  society’s  benefit.’’  The  paper  identified  nine
points  and  provided  example  licensing  clauses  to  address  each  point.  The  nine
points included:

• Universities  should  reserve  the  right  to  practice  licensed  inventions  and  to

allow other non-profit and governmental organizations to do so.

• Exclusive  licenses  should  be  structured  in  a  manner  that  encourages  tech-

nology development and use.

• Strive to minimize the licensing of ‘‘future improvements.’’
• Ensure broad access to research tools.
• Consider including provisions that address unmet needs, such as those of ne-
glected patient populations or geographic areas, giving particular attention to
improved therapeutics, diagnostics and agricultural technologies for the devel-
oping world.

Legislation.  What  changes  in  Bayh-Dole  legislation  or  regulations,  if  any,  may  be
appropriate to address these issues as we look to the next 25 years, to promote inno-
vation,  commercialization  of  federally  funded  research,  and  U.S.  economic  develop-
ment? The issues may be directly tied to the Bayh-Dole statute or a matter of imple-
mentation of the law.

The  issues  raised  include  addressing  incentives  that  discourage  scientific  sharing
of  information,  protecting  access  to  research  tools,  and  the  role  government  should
play  in  pricing  to  increase  humanitarian  access  to  products  and  services  such  as
therapeutic drugs.5

Chairman  WU.  Welcome  everyone,  to  this  afternoon’s  general
hearing  on  Bayh-Dole  legislation  and  its  effect  on  our  economic
competitiveness and our university enterprise.

It has been a quarter century since Bayh-Dole was enacted. It is
time  to  assess  the  impact  of  that  legislation,  and  whether  we  can
improve  technology  transfer  from  the  federal  investment  in  re-
search. I want to mention that this will be only the first of several
hearings  on  technology  transfer.  At  this  point  in  time,  it  is  my  in-
tention  to  hold  further  subcommittee  hearings  on  Stevenson-
Wydler legislation.

It  took  a  good  while,  perhaps  close  to  20  years,  to  achieve  pas-
sage of the Bayh-Dole legislation. The House Committee on Science
and Technology held hearings in 1979 and 1980 on the original leg-
islation,  and  this  committee  has  been  a  very  strong  supporter  of
improving technology transfer.

The  broad  economic  conditions  during  the  time  of  passage  of
Bayh-Dole  were  a  factor  in  shaping  it.  The  U.S.  economy  was  in  a
deep  recession.  Productivity  was  declining,  and  our  country  faced
growing competition internationally from both Germany and Japan
and certain other countries. At that point in time, I was beginning
to practice law in Silicon Valley, and quite frankly, there were folks
who  said  that  Silicon  Valley  was  going  to  die,  and  that  we  just
weren’t going to compete in high tech any more. And there are oth-
ers,  policy-makers  in  Washington,  D.C.,  who  said  potato  chips,  sil-
icon  chips,  it  hardly  matters  which  one  it  is,  because  it  is  just  all
about money. And that is not true.

Now,  promoting  university-based  research  and  its  subsequent
technology  transfer  to  industry,  was  seen  at  that  time,  and  con-
tinues  to  be  seen  as  a  very,  very  important  policy  tool  to  counter
international  competition,  and  to  stimulate,  irregardless  of  inter-
national competition, domestic, economic, and job growth.

The purpose of this hearing is to assess the current implementa-
tion  of  Bayh-Dole  from  the  perspectives  of  universities  and  indus-
try,  and  to  hear  recommendations  to  improve  the  implementation
of Bayh-Dole, as we look forward to the next quarter century.

A few key questions that we will consider. What has been the im-
pact of the current implementation of Bayh-Dole on federally fund-
ed university research, technology transfer, and the commercializa-
tion of that research? How has Bayh-Dole shaped university-indus-
try  research  collaboration?  Are  there  differences  in  interpretation
of the statute and regulations by universities, industry, and others?
What is the possible effect of the increasing globalization of the re-
search  enterprise?  Are  U.S.  companies  turning  to  foreign  univer-
sities  for  research  collaboration?  Are  foreign  companies  turning  to
U.S. universities to the same extent? How do the intellectual prop-
erty and business practices at U.S. universities compare to univer-
sities  in  other  developed  and  developing  countries?  Has  Bayh-Dole
influenced  basic  university  research,  academic  collaboration,  and
the  broad  dissemination  of  knowledge?  In  what  way  does  the  law
promote  innovation?  Has  it  created  any  barriers?  Finally,  how  can
we  improve  technology  transfer  as  we  look  forward  to  the  next  25
years,  to  promote  innovation  and  commercialization  of  federally
funded research, and promote U.S. economic development?

All  of  these  questions  are  on  the  table  today,  and  in  our  subse-
quent hearings, we look forward to hearing the thoughts of our wit-
nesses,  and  also  of  the  comments  and  questions  from  our  fellow
members of this subcommittee.

And now, I would like to recognize my colleague and good friend,
the ranking member from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, for his opening re-
marks.

[Statement of Mr. Wu follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  afternoon’s  general  hearing  on  Bayh-Dole.
More  than  25  years  have  passed  since  Bayh-Dole  was  enacted.  It  is  time  to  assess
the impact of Bayh-Dole and how we can improve technology transfer from Federal
investment  in  R&D.  I  want  to  mention  that  this  will  be  our  first  hearing  on  tech-
nology transfer issues. The Subcommittee will hold a subsequent hearing on Steven-
son-Wydler.

It took almost 20 years to achieve passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. Indeed the House
Committee on Science and Technology, held hearings in 1979 and 1980 on the origi-
nal legislation. This committee has been a strong supporter of improving technology
transfer.

Broad  economic  conditions  were  a  factor  shaping  Bayh-Dole.  The  U.S.  economy
was in a recession, productivity was declining, and the U.S. faced growing competi-
tion  internationally  from  Germany  and  Japan.  Promoting  university  based  innova-
tion  and  technology  transfer  to  industry  was  seen  as  an  important  policy  lever  to
counter  these  developments.  And  it  still  is  today  as  we  face  greater  global  competi-
tion—which now includes R&D.

The purpose of this hearing is to assess the current implementation of Bayh-Dole
from the perspectives of universities and industry, and to hear recommendations to
improve the current implementation as we look toward the next 25 years.

A few key questions we will consider today:

• What has been the impact of the current implementation of Bayh-Dole on fed-
erally  funded  university  research,  technology  transfer  and  commercialization
of that research?
• How  has  Bayh-Dole  shaped  university-industry  research  collaboration?  Are
there  differences  in  interpretation  of  the  statute  and  regulations  by  univer-
sities and industry?
• What  is  the  possible  effect  of  the  increasing  globalization  of  research?  Are
U.S. companies turning to foreign universities for research collaboration? How
do  the  intellectual  property  and  business  practices  at  U.S.  universities  com-
pare to universities in other developed and developing countries?
• Has  Bayh-Dole  influenced  basic  university  research,  academic  collaboration
and  the  broad  dissemination  of  knowledge?  In  what  ways  does  the  law  pro-
mote innovation; has it created any barriers?

And finally,

• How  can  we  improve  technology  transfer  as  we  look  to  the  next  25  years,  to
promote innovation, commercialization of federally funded research, and U.S.
economic development?

All these questions are on the table today for comment and discussion by our wit-

nesses and we look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Now, I would like to recognize my colleague and the ranking member from Geor-

gia, Dr. Gingrey, for his opening remarks.

Mr. GINGREY. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, and certainly, I ap-

preciate your holding this hearing on the Bayh-Dole Act.

And certainly, as you point out, it is a timely issue. We have just
celebrated  the  Act’s  25  years  of  existence.  I  agree  with  you,  Mr.
Chairman, the time is indeed right to look at the program, and see
where  we  can  improve  it,  and  ensure  that  the  next  25  years  are
just as successful as have been the past 25 years.

In  The  Economist,  and  this  is  a  quote:  The  Bayh-Dole  Act  is
‘‘probably  the  most  inspired  piece  of  legislation  to  be  enacted  in

America over the past half-century.’’ I don’t think that is an embel-
lishment,  when  we  think  about  the  remarks  that  you  just  heard
from the Chairman, in regard to the global economy, and what our
concerns might be as we go forward.

The Bayh-Dole Act was passed in an era of deep concern that the
United  States  was  indeed  losing  that  competitive  edge  to  some  of
these foreign countries, certainly, India and China, to name two big
ones.  Its  impact  in  reversing  that  trend  has  been  phenomenal.  In
fact,  Bayh-Dole  has  been  the  most  successful  technology  transfer
program ever implemented. Prior to Bayh-Dole, only five percent of
government-owned  patents  were  ever  used  in  the  private  sector.
Let me repeat that. Only five percent of government-owned patents
were ever used in the private sector.

Since  the  passage  of  this  landmark  legislation,  there  has  been  a
tenfold increase in academic patents. It is often said that the clear-
est  form  of  flattery  is  imitation.  Well,  countries  all  over  the  world
are  indeed  copying  Bayh-Dole,  from  the  Europeans  to  the  govern-
ments of Japan and India, and I am sure China as well. As we are
now  combating  the  often  negative  effects  of  globalization,  perhaps
there  is  no  better  time,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  see  if  there  are  any  im-
provements that we can make in this law.

Some of the principal players in this program, businesses do say
that  it  has  become  increasingly  difficult  to  come  to  an  agreement
with universities. I hope we will be able to find out in this hearing
what is the problem. And so, instead, some businesses say they are
increasingly making the sort of cooperative agreements that Bayh-
Dole  is  supposed  to  facilitate  in  this  country,  but  they  are  making
them with foreign universities, not American universities. It is sort
of a globalization of research, if you will.

So,  we  need  to  ensure  that  Bayh-Dole  meets  the  21st  Century
needs of both business and universities, in order to ensure that the
United  States’  competitiveness  is  first  and  foremost;  because  we
are,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  in  an  economic  war.  Make  no  mistake
about  that.  The  Economist  went  further,  and  said,  and  I  quote:  ‘‘A
dollar’s worth of academic invention or discovery requires upwards
of  $10,000  of  private  capital  to  bring  it  to  market.’’  So,  clearly,
there  is  a  need  to  marry  private  enterprise  with  university  re-
search,  as  Bayh-Dole  intended,  when  it  was  originally  passed  25
years ago.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  indeed,  as  a  graduate  of  the  Georgia  Institute
of  Technology,  would  like  to  plug  my  alma  mater  at  every  shame-
less opportunity, I appreciate your holding this hearing on such an
important  topic,  and  I  do  look  forward  to  hearing  from  all  of  our
witnesses, not just the one from Georgia Tech.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Good Afternoon Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing on the Bayh-
Dole  Act.  It’s  a  timely  issue,  as  we  have  just  celebrated  the  Act’s  first  25  years  in
existence.  I  agree  with  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  time  is  indeed  right  to  look  at

tive  edge  to  foreign  countries.  Its  impact  in  reversing  that  trend  has  been  phe-
nomenal.

In fact, Bayh-Dole has been the most successful technology transfer program ever
implemented.  Prior  to  Bayh-Dole,  only  five  percent  of  government  owned  patents
were  ever  used  in  the  private  sector.  Since  passage  of  this  landmark  legislation,
however, there has been a tenfold increase in academic patents.

It  is  often  said  that  the  clearest  form  of  flattery  is  imitation.  Well,  countries  all
over  the  world  are  copying  the  Bayh-Dole  Act—from  the  Europeans  to  the  govern-
ments of Japan and India.

As we are now combating the often negative effects of globalization, perhaps there
is no better time to see if there are any improvements to be made to the Bayh-Dole
law.

Some of the principal players in this program—businesses—do say that it has be-
come  increasingly  difficult  to  come  to  agreement  with  universities.  Instead,  some
businesses say that they are increasingly making the sort of cooperative agreements
that Bayh-Dole is supposed to facilitate, but they are making them with foreign uni-
versities—a  sort  of  globalization  of  research.  We  need  to  ensure  that  Bayh-Dole
meets  the  21S‘  Century  needs  of  both  businesses  and  universities,  in  order  ensure
that U.S. competitiveness is first and foremost.

Further,  according  to  The  Economist,  ‘‘A  dollar’s  worth  of  academic  invention  or
discovery  requires  upwards  of  ten  thousand  dollars  of  private  capital  to  bring  [it]
to  market.’’  Clearly  there  is  a  need  to  marry  private  enterprise  with  university  re-
search, as Bayh-Dole intended.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  your  holding  this  hearing  on  such  an  in  important

topic. and I look forward to hearing from all of the witnesses. Thank you.

Chairman  WU.  Well,  Dr.  Gingrey,  I  think  that  Georgia  Tech  al-
ways  has  a  better  football  team  than  Oregon  Health  and  Science
University.

If  there  are  Members  who  wish  to  submit  opening  statements,

your statements will be added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Throughout the twentieth century, the United States led the world in university-

driven research and development.

This  research  inspired  much  of  the  innovation  upon  which  we  have  come  to  rely.
From  the  Internet  boom  to  countless  medical  breakthroughs,  university  research
has benefited us all.

There  is  no  doubt  that  our  world  class  university  system  with  federal  support,
such as the Bayh-Dole Act, is one of the reasons our nation has enjoyed the techno-
logical success that it has.

This  law  enabled  the  spread  of  government  funded  research  from  the  world  of
ideas  into  the  world  of  application.  The  patent  transfer  policy  enabled  businesses
to focus on production, while the government took on the risk associated with uncer-
tain research projects.

Since  enactment,  Bayh-Dole  related  development  has  created  over  a  quarter  of  a
million  jobs  and  added  $40  billion  annually  to  our  economy.  In  my  district,  Bayh-
Dole has benefited Arizona State University.

The advancement of communications technology and global trade agreements has
led  to  the  inevitable  re-examination  of  university,  government,  and  business  re-
search partnerships.

As  we  consider  the  next  twenty-five  years  of  this  legislation,  the  growing  global

market cannot be too far from our consideration.

We must strive to maintain the high intellectual standards of our top universities,
and  ensure  that  their  research  makes  it  into  real-world  applications  through  stra-
tegic business and government partnerships.

I am looking forward to hearing from our witnesses to see how we can accomplish

these complementary goals.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman WU. As our witnesses are well aware, your time is lim-
ited to five minutes. Please feel free to summarize your written tes-
timony, and now, let me introduce the witnesses.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ARUNDEEP  S.  PRADHAN,  DIRECTOR,
TECHNOLOGY  AND  RESEARCH  COLLABORATIONS,  OREGON
HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY; VICE PRESIDENT FOR AN-
NUAL  MEETINGS  AND  BOARD  OF  TRUSTEES,  ASSOCIATION
OF UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY MANAGERS
Mr.  PRADHAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and
honorable Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this oppor-
tunity  to  testify  before  you  today  on  the  important  topic  of  the
Bayh-Dole  Act.  In  addition  to  my  role  as  Director  for  Technology
and  Research  Collaborations  at  Oregon  Health  &  Science  Univer-
sity, I am also on the Board of Trustees for the Association for Uni-
versity Technology Managers, or AUTM.

I  have  been  asked  to  provide  my  opinion,  as  well  as  express  the
views  of  the  AUTM  Board,  on  various  topics  related  to  the  Bayh-
Dole Act, and how it relates to academic technology transfer. These
views  are  a  result  of  my  19  years  of  experience  in  this  industry,
covering three institutions in Utah, Colorado, and now, Oregon. We
believe  that  the  Bayh-Dole  has  been  instrumental  in  accelerating
innovation  in  the  United  States,  and  hopefully,  will  continue  to  be
a key factor in driving U.S. innovation policy for the next 25 years.
As  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  stated,  The  Economist  called  the
Bayh-Dole  Act  one  of  the  most  possibly  inspired  pieces  of  legisla-
tion to be enacted in America, that unlocked inventions and discov-
eries throughout the United States. The Bayh-Dole Act is as viable
today  as  it  was  when  conceived  and  passed,  and  I  believe  that  we
are  only  seeing  the  proverbial  tip  of  the  iceberg.  The  impacts  of
Bayh-Dole are diverse, such as the 5,000 companies that are based
on  university  research,  the  1.25  products  per  day  that  have  been
introduced  as  a  result  of  that  over  the  last  10  years,  the  260,000
jobs that have been created, and the addition of over $40 billion an-
nually  to  the  U.S.  economy.  The  Biotechnology  Industry  Organiza-
tion, or BIO, has identified over 350 drugs based on federally fund-
ed  research  that  are  either  available  now,  or  are  currently  in  clin-
ical trials.

Another  impact  of  Bayh-Dole,  according  to  the  former  President
of  the  NASDAQ,  is  that  approximately  30  percent  of  its  value  is
rooted  in  university-based  federally  funded  research,  which  might

never have been realized but for Bayh-Dole. State investment in in-
novation  has  also  been  a  key,  although  unanticipated  outcome  of
the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  Just  since  2005,  19  states  have  begun  initia-
tives  targeted  to  innovation,  representing  approximately  $4  billion
in the next 10 years.

A  key  similarity  to  a  number  of  these  initiatives  is  the  role  of
universities  as  drivers  of  regional  economic  development.  In  Or-
egon,  for  example,  several  such  programs  are  coordinated  through
the  Oregon  Innovation  Council.  Signature  research  centers  in  the
field  of  nanotechnology,  bio-economy,  and  sustainable  technologies,
and  drug  development  and  translational  research,  funding  of  pro-
grams  to  foster  university-industry  partnerships  in  seafood,  manu-
facturing, and food technologies, and the creation of university ven-
ture  development  funds  through  Oregon  tax  credits,  all  come  to-
gether in Oregon’s investment into resources that foster innovation
and development.

With  respect  to  university-industry  interactions,  it  is  an  issue  of
competing  cultures  and  drivers,  trying  to  create  partnerships  for
societal and mutual benefit. These differences are most often high-
lighted  in  negotiations  regarding  the  right  to  publish  and  intellec-
tual  property.  These  issues  do  not  arise  directly  from  Bayh-Dole,
but from the fundamentally different roles that universities and in-
dustry play in society.

Any partnership based on economic incentives needs to be fair to
both  parties  in  order  to  succeed.  It  is  therefore  incumbent  on  both
parties  to  recognize  the  synergies  and  differences,  as  well  as  fed-
eral and State regulations and policies that play a role to arrive at
mutually  beneficial  partnerships.  The  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  one  such
example.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  fundamentally  provides  a  simple  structure
that  works  as  intended,  and  should  not  be  substantially  altered.
Further, the Bayh-Dole Act offers great opportunity to ensure that
technology  can  be  appropriately  packaged  and  commercialized.  As
you  yourself  suggested,  one  dollar  of  academic  research  requires
$10,000 of development to make it into a product. The Nine Points
to Consider document that is being promoted by a number of orga-
nizations  in  AUTM,  for  example,  begins  to  provide  consistency  to
the implementation of Bayh-Dole to arrive at these objectives.

If anything, Bayh-Dole needs to be strengthened, starting with a
comprehensive look at programs and initiatives being implemented,
successful  technology  transfer  programs,  local  and  regional  factors
that  contribute  to  the  success  of  commercializing  federally  funded
research. One such example would be to provide effective oversight,
which  would  be  able  to  address  the  implementation  of  Bayh-Dole
across federal agencies.

In summation, I would like to emphasize that technology transfer
at  universities,  as  it  exists  today,  is  a  complex  process  that  has
multiple  roles,  ranging  from  being  good  stewards  of  public  re-
sources  to  participants  in  economic  development.  These  roles  are,
in  turn,  defined  by  local,  regional,  and  national  needs  and  regula-
tions.

It  is  critical  that  the  U.S.  preserve  Bayh-Dole  and  its  funda-
mental  elements,  and  continue  to  support  funding  of  basic  re-

search,  so  that  our  country  can  maintain  its  leading  edge  in  inno-
vation in this increasingly competitive global environment.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ARUNDEEP S. PRADHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  and  honorable  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today  on  the  impor-
tant topic of the Bayh-Dole Act which has been instrumental in accelerating the evo-
lution  of  innovation  in  the  United  States,  and  hopefully  will  continue  to  be  a  key
factor in driving the U.S. innovation policy for the next 25 years.

My name is Arundeep S. Pradhan, and I am currently the Director of Technology
and Research Collaborations at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in
Portland, Oregon and serve on the Board of Trustees for the Association of Univer-
sity  Technology  Managers  (AUTM).  AUTM  is  a  nonprofit  organization  dedicated  to
promoting,  supporting  and  enhancing  the  global  academic  technology  transfer  pro-
fession  through  education,  training  and  communications.  AUTM’s  more  than  3,500
members, primarily managers of intellectual property, represent more than 300 uni-
versities,  research  institutions  and  teaching  hospitals  as  well  as  numerous  busi-
nesses and government organizations.

My  office  at  OHSU  is  responsible  for  managing  and  commercializing  the  intellec-
tual assets of the university; forging ties with industrial partners; and participating
in  various  programs  and  initiatives  with  institutional,  local,  State  and  regional
groups to align the interests of universities, city and State constituencies as to effec-
tively achieve success in technology transfer objectives.

I have been asked to give my opinion, as well as express the views of the AUTM
Board,  on  various  aspects  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  (35  U.S.C.  200–212)  and  how  it  re-
lates  to  academic  technology  transfer.  These  views  are  a  result  of  my  19  years  of
experiences  in  this  industry,  which  began  as  a  student  working  in  the  technology
transfer  office  at  the  University  of  Utah  where  we  established  the  culture  for  col-
laborating  not  only  with  numerous  start-up  companies,  but  also  with  existing  com-
panies in the fields of biotechnology, pharmaceutics, electronics and software. I sub-
sequently spent five years at the Colorado State University Research Foundation in
Fort Collins, where we continued the proactive approach to collaborating with State,
local and regional organizations to further technology transfer and economic impact
missions of the university.
Historical Perspective

In 1980 prior to the Bayh-Dole Act, the Federal Government held title to approxi-
mately  28,000  patents  of  which  fewer  that  five  percent  were  licensed  to  companies
for commercialization into products per the 1998 GAO Report on the Act. This lack
of  commercialization  can  be  attributed  to  several  factors,  among  which  are  a  lack
of  incentives  for  universities  and  faculty  to  engage  in  technology  transfer,  patent
policy  that  varied  by  federal  agency,  and  a  lack  of  clarity  of  ownership  of  patents
developed under federal funding.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  represented  a  fundamental  change  in  government  patent  pol-
icy. It provided ownership and title to any invention made in whole or in part with
federal  funds  under  Bayh-Dole  to  universities  and  small  business.  The  government
reserved  for  itself  a  royalty-free  license  to  practice  any  such  invention  for  govern-
mental purpose. Further, the Bayh-Dole Act was instrumental in establishing a Fed-
eral  patent  policy  that  was  uniformly  applied  to  all  of  its  agencies,  as  well  as  pro-
viding  the  first  statutory  authority  for  the  government  itself  to  obtain,  own  and  li-
cense patents.

The  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  has  been  instrumental  in  recognizing
that  federal  patent  policy  is  an  integral  part  of  U.S.  competitiveness  and  helped  to
shape  the  current  environment  in  which  we  function.  This  committee  not  only  was
instrumental  in  fashioning  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  but  also  the  Federal  Technology
Transfer  Act  in  1986.  We  thank  you  for  your  foresight  in  establishing  policies  that
have helped the U.S. be a leader in innovation.
Summary Conclusions
1. Impact  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  on  Research,  Technology  Transfer  and  Commer-

cialization
On  December  14,  2002,  The  Economist  stated  that  ‘‘Possibly  the  most  inspired
piece  of  legislation  to  be  enacted  in  America  over  the  past  half-century  was  the
Bayh-Dole  Act  of  1980.  Together  with  amendments  in  1984  and  augmentation  in

1986,  this  unlocked  all  the  inventions  and  discoveries  that  have  been  made  in  lab-
oratories  throughout  the  United  States  with  the  help  of  taxpayer’s  money.  More
than  anything,  this  single  policy  measure  helped  to  reverse  America’s  precipitous
slide into industrial irrelevance.’’ The Bayh-Dole Act truly has been instrumental in
achieving that goal.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  as  fully  viable  today  as  it  was  when  passed  in  1980.  Since
1980,  American  universities  have  spun  off  more  than  5,000  companies,  which  have
been  responsible  for  the  introduction  of  1.25  products  per  day  into  the  marketplace
and have contributed to the creation of over 260,000 jobs. The result has been a con-
tribution of over $40 billion dollars annually to the American economy.

The  Biotechnology  Industry  Organization  (BIO)  has  identified  60  drugs  derived
from university research, and there are over 300 biotechnology therapeutic products
based on federally funded research that are now in clinical trials. Examples of these
include  the  Hepatitis  B  Vaccine  (Fox  Chase  Cancer  Center);  New  Therapeutics  for
Prostate Cancer (OHSU); New Treatments for Heart Disease (Emory University).

These breakthroughs of commercial applications occur not only in the field of bio-
technology and life sciences, but in all fields ranging from electronics to agriculture

2. How has the Bayh-Dole Act Shaped University-Industry Relations?

Prior  to  passage  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  and  with  no  uniform  government  patent
policy  in  place,  each  of  the  government  agencies  had  developed  its  own  patent  pol-
icy.  The  majority  of  those  were  ‘‘title’’  policies,  where  ownership  resided  in  the  gov-
ernment as represented by the agency. Most agencies had also adopted a non-exclu-
sive licensing policy to such inventions. As a consequence industry was highly reluc-
tant to obtain non-exclusive licenses from the government knowing it could not real-
ly  exercise  control  over  the  invention  licensed  and  that  a  competitor  could  obtain
a  similar  license.  Simply  put,  there  was  no  reward,  in  the  form  of  marketplace  ex-
clusivity  to  justify  the  risk  and  expense  necessary  to  develop  an  invention  for  the
market.

Moreover,  industry  was  reluctant  to  fund  research  at  the  universities  for  fear  of
government  funds  ‘‘contaminating’’  the  research  that  was  sponsored  and  because  of
the  ‘‘title’’  policy  adopted  by  the  agencies,  depriving  the  particular  sponsor  of  the
right to assert ownership to any invention arising from the sponsored research. The
‘‘contamination’’  principle  was  particularly  onerous  since  there  was  no  de  minimis
amount  of  federal  funding  specified  for  triggering  the  government’s  right  to  take

title to an invention and even a single dollar of government money co-mingled with
the  industry-sponsor  research  funds  could  permit  the  government  to  assert  rights
to the invention or, at least, put a cloud on the title.

The  passage  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  established  certainty  of  title  in  and  to  inven-
tions  conveyed  to  the  universities  under  the  Act  and  alleviated  the  industry-spon-
sor’s fears, thereby encouraging additional sponsorship, collaborative efforts, and ex-
panded  licensing  opportunities.  Since  the  government  retains  a  non-exclusive  right
to inventions made in whole or in part with government funds but only for govern-
mental purposes, the relationship with the private sector is truly a university-indus-
try-government relationship and one which industry has been willing to accept.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  has  made  institutions  more  aware  of  their  role  in  being  good
stewards  of  public  resources,  including  capturing  a  fair  economic  value  of  federally
funded research contributions, and as Bayh-Dole requires, reinvesting any return in
research  and  education.  While  Bayh-Dole  does  not  directly  govern  industry  spon-
sored research, it establishes good practices within our offices that ensure that fed-
erally-funded technologies are commercialized for the public benefit, both as a result
of  licensing  inventions  directly  from  federally  funded  research  as  well  as  obtaining
exclusive licenses to inventions resulting from industry sponsored research. It is in-
cumbent on both sectors to foster, encourage and grow these collaborations.
3. Effects of Globalization of Research

The  global  environment  has  changed  considerably  in  the  last  two  decades.  Coun-
tries,  such  as  Germany,  United  Kingdom,  Singapore,  China  and  India,  are  increas-
ingly  pumping  resources  into  research  and  development  and  establishing  ties  be-
tween  industry  and  academic  institutions.  The  technological  and  basic  research
leads  that  the  U.S.  has  enjoyed  over  the  last  two  decades  should  not  be  taken  for
granted.  Recognizing  the  success  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  in  the  U.S.,  other  countries
are emulating our lead by passing similar laws. Bayh-Dole has reduced certain bar-
riers for collaborations with companies and also encouraged entrepreneurship across
all  aspects  of  university  research.  This  entrepreneurial  environment  provides  a  key
element  in  attracting,  training  and  retaining  students,  young  faculty  and  thought
leaders when other countries are becoming more welcoming to entrepreneurship.

Mr. Chairman, I understand that the Committee has heard reports that industry
is  looking  for  research  partners  overseas  because  they  find  it  so  hard  to  negotiate
with universities in the United States. I cannot vouch for whether those reports are
accurate, or what role different factors, including cost, play in those decisions. I can
speak to my experiences and to the issues that take up the most time in university
negotiations with industry.

The biggest, most time-consuming issue involves faculty researchers’ right to pub-
lish  their  research  findings  and  share  the  research  data  with  their  colleagues.  This
is a core issue for universities. The ability of faculty to publish, and thus to advance
the  state-of-the-art,  is  central  to  our  mission  and  is  probably  the  most  important
method of knowledge transfer we have. Intellectual property rights are also a point
of  negotiations.  They  are  complicated  because  a  fair  allocation  of  rights  and  access
to rights really depends on the particular facts of the research. It is hard to articu-
late  a  general  rule  for  what  is  fair  because  the  facts  and  circumstances  are  so  im-
portant. These issues do not arise from Bayh-Dole, but from the fundamentally dif-
ferent roles that universities and industry have in society.

In my capacity at OHSU, as well as historically, I have seen significant increases
in  university-industry  partnerships.  Over  the  last  five  years  at  OHSU,  the  number
of industry-sponsored research agreements has doubled and the amount of research
funding  has  almost  tripled.  I  feel  that  these  collaborations  will  continue  to  grow  in
the  future.  It  is  critical  that  the  U.S.  preserve  Bayh-Dole  and  its  fundamental  ele-
ments and continue to support the funding of basic research so that our country can
maintain our leading edge in innovation in this increasingly competitive global envi-
ronment.
4. The Bayh-Dole Act’s Influence on Basic Research

A study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) indi-
cates  that  there  is  no  significant  ‘‘negative’’  impact  of  technology  patents  and  com-
mercialization on scientific research in terms of access and sharing. There has how-
ever, been net positive outcome in terms of collaborations with industry, as is high-
lighted  by  the  fact  that  the  U.S.  has  seen  a  significant  increase  in  joint  industry-
university  scientific  papers  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  cited  as  a  signifi-
cant achievement for science in their annual Science and Engineering Indicators.

In  2006,  key  individuals  from  the  university  technology  transfer  community  and
Association  of  American  Medical  Colleges  (AAMC),  developed  ‘‘Nine  Points  to  Con-
sider  when  Licensing  University  Technology’’  (attached).  This  document  has  been

adopted  by  AUTM  and  recommended  to  its  members;  the  list  of  signatories  is  now
kept  by  the  AUTM,  much  like  AUTM  serves  as  a  repository  for  signatories  of  the
Uniform Biological Materials Transfer Agreement. This document is a set of guiding
principles  that  illustrate  general  good  practices.  The  first  point  in  this  document  is
to reserve the right to practice licensed inventions and to allow other non-profit and
government organizations to do so. The National Institutes of Health which provides
substantial funding for basic research also supports this approach. While Bayh-Dole
allows licensing of inventions for commercialization, it does not preclude use of such
inventions  for  continued  research.  This  and  the  other  points  in  this  document  are
meant to provide good practice guidelines for licensing. As each negotiation and re-
lationship is unique, it is incumbent to strike a balance between the business needs
of our industry partners as well as the fulfillment of the core mission of the univer-
sities.
5. Bayh-Dole: The Next Twenty-five Years

The architects of the Bayh-Dole Act, in which this committee played a role, exhib-
ited  profound  insight  as  Bayh-Dole  serves  as  the  foundation  for  technology-based
economic  development  by  allowing  universities  to  work  regionally  with  established
or start up companies to launch new products to benefit the public and at the same
time,  remains  flexible  to  encourage  partnerships  across  a  broad  spectrum  of  indus-
tries for a wide variety of technologies that are commercialized under different busi-
ness models. Bayh-Dole has been instrumental in linking the Federal and State gov-
ernments,  research  universities,  small  business  and  the  corporate  worlds  [11].  Be-
cause  the  impact  of  the  Bayh-Dole  is  now  far  reaching  and  affects  the  economy  at
multiple levels, any changes, if warranted at all, need to be evaluated prudently and
carefully  to  avoid  disruption  of  the  innovation  ecosystem.  I,  the  AUTM  Board  of
Trustees,  as  well  as  other  organizations,  believe  that  Bayh-Dole  works  well  as  in-
tended  and  we  anticipate  that  Bayh-Dole  will  continue  to  accelerate  technology
transfer and foster university-industry partnerships far into the future.
What has been the impact of Bayh-Dole on federally funded research and technology
transfer and commercialization of that research?

It has now been twenty eight years since Bayh-Dole passed. In those twenty eight
years  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  has  had  tremendous  impact  on  the  innovation  economy  of
the United States and has become the model for technology-based economic develop-
ment  not  only  in  the  U.S.,  but  on  a  global  scale.  Countries  such  as  Japan,  United
Kingdom, Germany and others hope to achieve the same success as we have in the
U.S.,  and  even  developing  countries  are  instituting  means  to  utilize  their  univer-
sities’ talents and research results to boost their economies.

The fundamental stated goal of Congress in passing the Bayh-Dole Act was to pro-
mote the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research and de-
velopment.  I,  as  well  as  the  AUTM  Board,  believe  that  those  goals  have  been
achieved and we are becoming more effective in how this intention is implemented.
One clear indicator of innovation is the increase in ‘‘invention disclosures’’ from uni-
versity  faculty.  There  is  imaginative  research,  at  which  faculty  excels,  from  which,
in turn, arises invention and innovation. The increase in invention disclosures is an
indication that there has been a cultural change in how faculty and academic insti-
tutions  view  transferring  the  results  of  research  in  a  manner  to  further  benefit  the
public.  In  addition  to  the  traditional  method  of  publishing  research  results  which
continues  to  be  pursued  vigorously,  universities  and  their  faculty  are  increasingly
aware  that  commercialization  of  research  results  can  significantly  impact  society
through  improving  the  health,  welfare  and  safety  of  the  public.  And,  as  with  any
cultural changes, it takes time; it is not something that will be adopted at the turn
of a switch. In 1980, approximately 25 U.S. universities had technology transfer of-
fices  and  no  uniform  federal  patent  policy  existed.  Today,  more  than  230  U.S.  uni-
versities  support  such  offices.  In  1980,  only  a  few  patents  were  issued  to  univer-
sities.  Today,  universities  are  granted  approximately  four  percent  of  U.S.  patents.
This success has its roots in the Bayh-Dole Act.

The academic community and federal agencies continue to find new ways to inno-
vate.  This  is  evidenced  by  new  programs,  such  as  NIH’s  Clinical  and  Translational
Science  Awards  that  encourage  interdisciplinary  collaborations,  collaborations  with
companies and movement of research from the bench to its applications. While this
may  indicate  a  willingness  to  use  federal  research  funding  to  implement  applica-
tions  of  basic  research,  the  emphasis  of  federally  funded  research  clearly  continues
to  be  on  basic  research.  A  recent  study  conducted  by  the  AAAS  concludes  that  sci-
entific  research  has  not  been  hindered  significantly  by  technology  patents  and  li-
censing  activities  [4].  Therefore,  federally-funded  inventions  can  continue  to  stimu-
late more research while being developed into useful, commercial products.

There  are  annual  increases  in  the  activities  and  outcomes  that  AUTM  has  been
tracking  for  the  last  fifteen  years.  Since  1980,  there  are  now  over  28,000  active  li-
censes of technologies to companies, and, 5,171 spin-off companies based on univer-
sity  research  [2].  A  great  majority  of  these,  in  fact,  arose  during  the  last  decade,
indicating an acceleration of the rate at which research is transferred into the mar-
ket place. These numbers only tell part of the story. Over the last two years, AUTM
has documented specific societal impact through the Better World Reports that con-
tain descriptions of university-based discoveries and inventions that have had a sig-
nificant impact on the health of our citizens and the economic well-being of our soci-
ety.  This  is  not  the  only  measure  of  the  innovation  economy  on  which  the  success
of  Bayh-Dole  should  be  based.  According  to  the  former  President  of  the  NASDAQ
stock market, an estimated 30 percent of its value is rooted in university-based, fed-
erally  funded  research  results  which  might  never  have  been  realized  but  for  the
Bayh-Dole Act. Technology transfer as it exists today is a complex process that has
multiple roles and objectives defined by local, regional, and national needs and regu-
lations.

Since  1997,  when  AUTM  started  tracking  this  metric,  3,641  new  products  were
introduced in the economy, 527 in 2005 alone. This represents 1.25 products per day
[2].  This  illustrates  significant  innovation  occurring  in  our  universities  and  nation
that  is  directly  based  on  federally  funded  research  at  universities  and  small  busi-
nesses.

State  investment  in  innovation  has  also  been  a  key,  although  unanticipated,  out-
come  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  A  significant  number  of  these  investments  involve  aca-
demic  institutions  which  are  viewed  as  key  partners  and  drivers  of  regional  eco-
nomic development. Since 2005, 19 states have begun initiatives targeted to innova-
tion in the form of investment into university R&D; these include providing private
sector  R&D  incentives  to  partner  with  academic  institutions,  new  business  innova-
tion  support,  and  tax  credits  for  new  business  R&D  investment.  This  incremental
investment  represents  approximately  $4  billion  in  the  next  ten  years  and  is  only  a
sample of programs being initiated by various states.

In Oregon, as in many other states, several programs were initiated to encourage
the  transfer  of  research  from  research  institutions  to  the  marketplace.  In  the  last
six years, Oregon has committed to the formation of Signature Research Centers in
the  fields  of  nanotechnology,  bio-economy  &  sustainable  technologies,  and  drug  de-
velopment  and  translational  research,  the  purpose  of  which,  among  other  things  is
to foster university-industry partnerships. The Oregon universities have been active
in this field in the last decade.

• Since  the  Oregon  Nanoscience  and  Microtechnologies  Institute  (ONAMI)  has
been  in  existence,  ONAMI  has  been  able  to  leverage  State  and  federal  re-
sources  for  cutting  edge  research  and  launch  start-up  companies  such  as
HomeDialysis+  (a  light-weight  medical  device  that  will  allow  patients  with
failing kidneys to receive dialysis over night in their own homes).
• Research  at  Oregon  Health  &  Science  University  has  been  the  basis  of  over
• Oregon  is  unique  in  the  creation  of  University  Venture  Development  Funds,
by offering donors State tax credits, which are paid back to the state through
generation of income resulting from commercialization of university research.
All  of  these  programs  and  activities,  not  only  in  Oregon,  but  across  the  country

60 start-up companies, half of which have been started since 2002.

in different states reflect the impact of Bayh-Dole.
How has Bayh-Dole shaped University-Industry research collaborations?

Federally funded research leverages a tremendous amount of investment into the
research  and  development  infrastructure.  This  occurs  not  only  in  the  form  of  direct
investment  into  research  by  non-federal  entities  but  ranges  from  investment  into
companies  that  are  spun  off  and  investment  into  products  that  are  developed  from
licensed technologies.

Bayh-Dole  has  encouraged  the  formation  of  productive  university-industry  part-
nerships, especially in light of diminishing resources at all levels. The demise of cor-
porate  research  laboratories  has  led  to  the  increasing  tendency  of  U.S.  industry  to
look to universities to perform research that a decade or two ago industry was more
likely  to  perform  itself.  Both  companies  and  universities  seek  to  leverage  their  re-
spective expertise in science and product development to further advance respective
goals.  While  AUTM  does  not  directly  track  the  number  of  industry-university  re-
search collaborations, the number of such research collaborations seems to be on the
increase. While the absolute number of dollars spent on research at academic insti-
tutions  has  increased,  the  latest  data  indicate  that  the  relative  percentages  from

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

17

federal,  industrial  and  non-federal  sources  have  been  relatively  stable  for  the  last
decade  [2].  At  a  time  where  the  resources  for  research  and  development  have  not
kept  pace  with  need,  it  is  important  to  recognize  these  cultural  differences  and  ar-
rive  at  pragmatic  solutions  that  benefit  both  industry  and  universities.  This  rep-
resents  a  highly  effective  mechanism  through  which  technology  is  transferred  and
not always in the form of patents and licenses.

It  is  important  to  highlight  at  this  point  the  differences  in  culture  between  aca-
demia  and  industry,  and  even  within  industry,  variations  in  culture  by  industry
cluster  as  well  as  by  the  size  of  a  company  and  institutions.  These  cultural  dif-
ferences  have  led  either  to  successful  collaboration  or  complete  breakdown  of  com-
munication between respective participants [3]. A fundamental tenet of a university
is  the  broad  dissemination  of  knowledge  through  peer-review  publications  and  edu-
cation  and  training  of  students.  Companies  maintain  a  more  secretive  environment
for their proprietary technologies and to ensure a return to their shareholders. Uni-
versity-industry partnerships in the field of biological or life sciences are most often
highlighted as these products require significant investment by industry and remain
visibly  available  for  many  years.  In  other  fields  where  an  exclusive  position  is  less
critical  and  product  life  cycles  are  measured  in  months,  federally-funded  research
still  plays  a  role  as  academic  institutions  transfer  both  knowledge  and  technology
developed under federal funding.

Any partnership which is based on economic incentives needs to be fair to the par-
ties in that arrangement. It is therefore incumbent on both parties to recognize the
synergies,  differences,  as  well  as  activities  that  may  be  prohibited  not  only  by  fed-
eral  statute,  but  also  State  laws  and  regulations  and  policies  to  arrive  at  mutually
beneficial  partnerships  [5].  The  Bayh-Dole  Act,  while  significant,  represents  one  of
several  pieces  of  legislation  that  plays  a  role  in  defining  the  interactions  and  rela-
tionships between academic and non-profit research institutions and industry.
What is the possible effect of the increasing globalization of research?

U.S.  universities  and  companies  increasingly  function  in  a  global  environment.
Both universities and companies have to therefore recognize additional cultural dif-
ferences  and  address  issues  that  arise  from  crossing  international  borders.  These
differences  are  also  evident  in  dealing  with  local  divisions  of  larger  multinational
companies which now have access to expertise and facilities on a global basis.

Universities have traditionally fostered research collaborations both nationally as
well  as  internationally.  The  issues  of  intellectual  property  development  have  not
typically  been  a  stumbling  block  in  such  collaborations.  As  other  countries  see  the
success of Bayh-Dole, they have increased their respective funding of basic research
and  implemented  laws,  regulations  and  policies  that  mimic  Bayh-Dole  in  an  effort
to become successful in the innovation economy. Whereas in the U.S., federal fund-
ing  for  research  has  grown  in  the  last  decade,  but  has  been  flat  over  the  last  few
years—increasing  number  of  applicants  for  the  same  size  pie—this  is  also  true  for
industry  based  research  funding  at  universities.  This  only  serves  to  highlight  the
increasing amount of competition for limited research resources in the U.S.

However, a large proportion of university-industry collaborations involve not large
multinational  companies,  but  more  medium  and  small  businesses  that  do  not  have
the resources for international collaborations. For U.S. institutions, this means that
actual barriers in collaborating with industry need to be reduced and perceived bar-
riers need to be addressed in order to achieve success in this area.
How has Bayh-Dole influenced Basic Research?

As  indicated  earlier,  an  AAAS  study  indicates  that  there  is  no  significant  impact
of  technology  patents  and  commercialization  on  scientific  research.  This  study  sur-
veyed  respondents  in  the  U.S.,  United  Kingdom,  Germany  and  Japan.  This  is  true
of  collaborations,  access  to  research  tools  and  publications  especially  between  aca-
demic  institutions.  Such  interactions  between  institutions  and  industry  are  also
commonplace, but usually proceed at a slower pace due to the differing cultures.

Bayh-Dole in giving great impetus to technology transfer and to cultural changes
on  how  best  to  utilize  research  results  for  the  public  benefit,  providing  some  focus
on the potential commercial applications derived from basic research. Most research
results  still  get  published  without  the  need  for  review  for  patent  protection.  There
is a small subset of research results that technology transfer staff as well as faculty
are learning to recognize to have commercial potential that does get published after
review,  and  if  necessary  after  filing  for  appropriate  protection.  It  is  the  intent  of
academic  institutions  to  pursue  commercialization  of  those  research  results  for  the
public benefit, but not to obstruct others from doing research in the same field.

What  changes  in  Bayh-Dole  if  any,  may  be  appropriate  as  look  to  the  next  25  years
to  promote  commercialization  of  federally  funded  research  and  U.S.  economic  devel-
opment?

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  fundamentally  provides  a  simple  structure  that  works  as  in-
tended  and  should  not  be  substantially  altered.  Further,  Bayh-Dole  offers  greater
opportunity  to  ensure  that  technology  can  be  appropriately  packaged  and  commer-
cialized. If anything, this opportunity needs to be strengthened. There are numerous
initiatives  that  are  being  implemented  at  the  State  and  regional  levels  that  are  fa-
cilitating  the  transfer  of  federally  funded  research  into  commercial  applications.  A
comprehensive  look  at  such  initiatives  can  be  conducted  to  determine  appropriate
models  for  adoption.  In  addition,  there  are  several  outstanding  technology  transfer
programs  that  have  been  successful  that  can  provide  information  on  creating  infra-
structure  that  leads  to  effective  transfer.  It  must  also  be  taken  into  accord  that
local,  regional,  and  State  stakeholders  also  play  a  significant  role  in  the  commer-
cialization of federally funded research.

Any development of programs that would augment Bayh-Dole should take into ac-
count  such  regional  drivers,  industry-academic  institution  cultural  differences,  re-
sources  allocated  for  technology  transfer  at  institutions,  education  and  training  of
technology transfer professionals as well as university faculty and staff, and appro-
priate metrics.

One  glaring  weakness  in  the  current  law  is  the  absence  of  effective  Executive
branch oversight. Congress made it clear that it expects for this function to be per-
formed by an entity with both the policy background and clout to insure that federal
agencies  do  not  start  interpreting  the  law  on  their  own.  We  have  noticed  that  the
implementation  of  Bayh-Dole  is  increasingly  uneven  across  federal  agencies.  The
oversight  authority  has  been  moved  over  the  years  from  the  Office  of  Federal  Pro-
curement  Policy  to  the  Department  of  Commerce.  It  is  now  time  to  re-examine  the
current  assignment  of  this  oversight  role  since  the  Department  of  Commerce  has
now  shown  little  interest  in  fulfilling  this  responsibility  for  many  years  and  in  fact
recently abolished the office that previously had been assigned the oversight respon-
sibilities.  Without  continued  effective  central  oversight,  agencies  may  tend  increas-
ingly  to  subordinate  Bayh-Dole  to  individual  policy  and  program  priorities  and  ob-
jectives, thus weakening the ability to accomplish the broader Bayh-Dole goals, and
we  will  de-evolve  back  into  the  situation  Congress  passed  Bayh-Dole  to  remedy:
agencies  developing  their  own  patent  policies  to  the  detriment  of  the  American
public’s health and future prosperity.

One  thought  is  that  this  oversight  authority  might  be  better  implemented  in  the
Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy.  While  this  makes  sense  in  looking  at  the
Executive  branch  organization  chart,  to  really  be  effective  what  is  really  needed  is
having someone who understands the importance of Bayh-Dole at the helm.
General Conclusions

Studies have found that universities are now drivers of regional economic develop-
ment  that  encourages  the  development  of  technology  based  clusters  which  are  im-
portant  factors  and  may  be  attributable  to  Bayh-Dole.  Many  countries  are  now
adopting Bayh-Dole type laws, as they see its successful implementation in the U.S.
The benefits derived directly as well as indirectly from Bayh-Dole are extensive and
should not be treated lightly due to a few anecdotal incidents.

The primary missions of universities to maintain academic freedom to conduct re-
search,  educate  and  train  students,  and  pursue  and  disseminate  knowledge  for  the
public benefit are protected by Bayh-Dole. In the course of the last 25 years, univer-
sities have learned a tremendous amount on how to interact with industry. Univer-
sities  are  learning  to  recognize  that  relationships  with  industry  are  dynamic;  vary
with industry sectors; and, above all that we must adapt to changing environments
as  per  the  respective  sectors.  As  I  have  indicated,  the  concerns  of  industry  do  not
lie with the Bayh-Dole Act itself, but in the manner in which some universities have
chosen  to  implement  it,  taking  a  narrow  perspective  on  what  defines  technology
transfer. In order to address this, several universities created, and the AUTM Board
of Trustees and additional universities have endorsed, the ‘‘Nine Points to Consider
when Licensing University Technology.’’ These points not only address licensing but
can also be applied broadly to university-industry research relationships.

While the Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to collect royalties from the licensing
of subject inventions, the core mission of universities remains education and genera-
tion  and  dissemination  of  new  knowledge.  Some  universities  may  focus  purely  on
the  licensing  revenues  to  measure  success  of  academic  technology  transfer,  but  the
real  impact  is  reflected  in  the  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  American  public.  In  addi-
tion,  many  inventions  generate  little  revenue,  and  the  amount  of  revenues  that  a
particular university receives is usually minuscule compared to the size of that uni-

versity’s  research  budget.  A  part  of  the  dissemination  mission  is  to  provide  the  in-
formation, whether it is in the form of education or in the form of technology trans-
fer,  to  those  who  can  best  utilize  it  for  the  public  benefit.  Prior  to  Bayh-Dole,  this
was  primarily  in  the  form  of  publications,  and  as  we  now  know,  it  takes  more.  It
has  taken  us  over  twenty-five  years  to  get  to  this  point,  and  we  should  not  disrupt
this trend. I, AUTM, as well as other organizations, believe that the Bayh-Dole Act
will continue to be a catalyst for innovation in the U.S. economy for the next twen-
ty-five years as well.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Mr. Pradhan. Dr. Butts.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  SUSAN  B.  BUTTS,  SENIOR  DIRECTOR,  EX-
TERNAL  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY  PROGRAMS,  THE  DOW
CHEMICAL COMPANY
Dr.  BUTTS.  Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee,  it  is  my  privilege  to  address  you  on  the
topic  of  Bayh-Dole,  the  next  25  years.  My  name  is  Susan  Butts,
and  I  am  the  Senior  Director  of  External  Science  and  Technology
Programs at The Dow Chemical Company. My group oversees, does
external  research  collaborations  around  the  world.  I  am  also  the
Vice  President  of  the  University-Industry  Demonstration  Partner-
ship,  an  organization  operating  under  the  auspices  of  the  Govern-
ment-University-Industry  Research  Roundtable,  which  is  in  the
National Academies.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  an  important  and  pivotal  piece  of  legisla-
tion  that  has  produced  many  benefits.  However,  as  you  consider
the next 25 years of Bayh-Dole, there are three key points to keep
in mind. First, although the Bayh-Dole Act has enabled the licens-
ing  of  federally  funded  technology  from  universities  to  industry,  it
has  also  created  expectations  for  control  of  intellectual  property
that actually discourage research collaborations with industry.

Second,  most  foreign  universities  offer  companies  much  more  fa-
vorable  rights  to  intellectual  property  arising  from  the  research
that  they  fund.  This  is  causing  companies  to  do  more  of  their  uni-
versity  research  collaborations  abroad.  Both  of  these  trends  could
have an adverse impact on U.S. competitiveness, since they will di-

minish  U.S.-based  collaborations,  which  can  generate  new  knowl-
edge, technologies, business opportunities, and jobs.

Third,  small  changes  in  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  and  tax  regulations
to clarify the intent of Congress relative to the treatment of inven-
tions  resulting  from  industry-funded  research,  could  significantly
improve  the  climate  for  university-industry  research  partnerships
in the United States.

I  am  sure  that  we  will  hear  many  different  points  of  view  in  to-
day’s  hearing.  The  important  issue  is  not  whether  Bayh-Dole  is
good  or  bad,  but  rather,  that  it  has  taken  the  U.S.  down  a  path
that  has  diverged  from  most  of  the  rest  of  the  world,  in  terms  of
university-industry  interactions.  Some  aspects  of  this  path  have
been  very  beneficial.  Other  aspects  have  been  detrimental.  The
challenge for our Nation is to put the United States on a new path
that will fully engage our vast technology resources from industry,
universities, and National Laboratories, to maximize U.S. competi-
tiveness in technology and innovation.

Innovation  is  the  translation  of  ideas  into  products.  It  happens
in  different  ways  and  different  technologies  and  industries.  In  my
written  testimony,  I  have  tried  to  reflect  issues  and  concerns  that
are broadly held across industries, but we should keep in mind that
there  are  important  differences.  In  industries  like  pharmaceuticals
and  chemicals,  innovation  is  a  discrete,  long,  and  costly  process.
Products  have  a  long  lifetime,  and  business  success  is  gained
through exclusive access to key patent protected products and proc-
esses.  In  industries  like  information  technology,  innovation  is  a
rapid,  continuous  process.  Each  product  embodies  many  tech-
nologies  and  devices,  products  have  a  short  lifetime,  and  business
success  is  gained  through  rapidly  getting  the  next  product  to  mar-
ket.

Pharmaceuticals  and  information  technology  define  two  ends  of
the  innovation  spectrum  for  technology-intensive  industries.  In
order  for  university-industry  collaborations  to  be  productive  and
mutually  beneficial,  they  must  be  flexible  enough  to  accommodate
the  whole  innovation  spectrum.  Globalization  is  a  reality.  U.S.-
based  companies  must  compete  effectively  in  the  global  market-
place in order to stay in business.

Globalization  also  brings  home  the  responsibility  that  govern-
ment,  industry,  and  universities  share  to  solve  the  most  serious
challenges  facing  mankind,  that  know  no  national  boundaries.
Challenges  like  climate  change  and  sustainable  energy,  food,  and
water.  My  employer,  The  Dow  Chemical  Company,  has  committed
to  meeting  corporate  sustainability  goals  to  help  address  these
challenges.  We  will  have  to  make  significant  technology  break-
throughs  to  meet  these  goals,  and  we  want  to  partners  with  the
best  university  researchers  to  do  this.  Unfortunately,  the  barriers
that we experience in working with U.S. universities often cause us
to seek out research partners with universities in other parts of the
world.

I believe that the Bayh-Dole Act is fundamentally sound with re-
gard to its stated purposes, but has gotten off-track in implementa-
tion, primarily through misapplication to research that is privately
funded  rather  than  government  funded.  This  causes  U.S.  univer-
sities to impose their rights and obligations under Bayh-Dole to re-

search that is funded by industry profits rather than taxpayer dol-
lars.

Clarification  of  the  intent  of  Congress,  and  the  laws  and  regula-
tions  that  impact  industry  funded  research  at  universities,  could
greatly  enhance  the  flexibility  that  both  parties  have  in  dealing
with  foreground  intellectual  property,  could  speed  the  process  to
negotiate research agreements, and thus, foster more university-in-
dustry partnerships in the United States.

Thank you for your attention, and I would welcome questions.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Butts follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SUSAN B. BUTTS

Chairman  Wu,  Ranking  Member  Gingrey,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  it
is  my  privilege  to  address  you  on  the  topic  of  Bayh-Dole—The  Next  25  Years.  My
name  is  Susan  Butts,  and  I  am  the  Senior  Director  of  External  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Programs  at  The  Dow  Chemical  Company.  My  group  oversees  all  of  Dow’s
research collaborations with universities, independent laboratories, government lab-
oratories,  and  government  agencies  around  the  world.  Dow  is  the  second  largest
chemical  company  in  the  world,  and  we  spend  over  one  billion  dollars  every  year
on research. Most of that funding is spent on internal programs but we also support
almost  200  external  sponsored  research  collaborations,  research  grants,  and  re-
search consortium memberships. I am also the current Vice President of the Univer-
sity-Industry  Demonstration  Partnership,  an  organization  operating  under  the  aus-
pices  of  the  Government-University-Industry  Research  Roundtable  which  is  in  the
National Academies.

There  are  three  key  points  that  I  would  like  to  make.  First,  although  the  Bayh-
Dole  Act  has  enabled  the  transfer  of  technology  developed  with  federal  funds  from
U.S. universities to industry it has also contributed to a contentious climate around
the  issue  of  intellectual  property  (IP)  rights  which  discourages  research  collabora-
tions  between  industry  and  U.S.  universities.  Second,  most  foreign  universities,
which  do  not  have  the  IP  expectations  created  by  Bayh-Dole,  allow  industry  re-
search  sponsors  to  own  or  control  inventions  resulting  from  the  research  that  they
fund.  This  much  more  favorable  treatment  of  IP  is  causing  companies  to  do  more
of  their  sponsored  research  abroad.  Both  of  these  trends  will  have  an  adverse  im-
pact  on  U.S.  competitiveness  since  they  will  diminish  U.S.-based  collaborations
which can generate new knowledge, technologies, and business opportunities. Third,
small changes in the Bayh-Dole Act and tax regulations to clarify the intent of Con-
gress  relative  to  ownership  or  control  of  intellectual  property  resulting  from  indus-
try-sponsored  research  could  improve  the  climate  for  university-industry  research
partnerships in the United States.

The Bayh-Dole Act is an important and pivotal piece of legislation. It has success-
fully  accomplished  one  of  its  primary  stated  purposes—to  promote  the  commer-
cialization  of  federally  funded  university  research.  There  has  also  been,  however,  a
negative and unintended consequence. Namely, that U.S. universities, in stark con-
trast with most foreign universities, have become substantially less attractive as re-
search partners for companies. As U.S. universities increasingly focus on controlling
intellectual  property  and  maximizing  their  revenues  from  licensing  inventions  they
have  become  more  like  competitors  than  partners  to  companies  that  sponsor  re-
search with their faculty and students. This is occurring at a time when global sci-
entific  challenges,  such  as  climate  change,  renewable  energy,  health,  and  nutrition
require collaboration like never before.

In  1980  when  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  was  passed  the  Federal  Government  was  the
main  source  of  funding  for  research  and  development  in  the  United  States  so  re-
search partnerships with companies were neither common nor necessary for univer-
sities.  Universities  published  their  research  results  and  companies  used  the  pub-
lished information to assist their internal research programs. Now, however, indus-
try spends twice as much on research and development as the Federal Government
so industry could be a significant source of research funding for universities (Figure
1).[1]  More  importantly,  such  research  collaborations  would  benefit  the  U.S.  econ-
omy  by  speeding  the  development  of  new  products  that  draw  on  both  company  and
university  technology  and  capabilities.  This  is  unlikely  to  happen,  however,  as  long
as companies and universities are at odds on how to treat intellectual property that
comes  from  company-sponsored  research.  Although  the  amount  of  university  re-
search funding from companies has grown steadily over the last 25 years it still rep-
resents  a  small  percentage  of  the  total  received  by  U.S.  universities  (Figure  2).[1]

In  a  speech  given  in  the  fall  of  2006  Dr.  John  Marburger,  Director  of  the  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy,  made  the  following  observation  about  the  necessity
of looking beyond the Federal Government to find sufficient funding to sustain U.S.
university research: ‘‘More likely in the foreseeable future is an increasing intensity
of competition for a large and expanding but finite federal research fund by a grow-
ing  number  of  research  capable  universities. . ..  More  promising  is  the  prospect  of
increasing  the  share  of  research  funding  contributed  by  the  states  and  by  the  pri-
vate  sector,  particularly  by  industries  that  benefit  from  technologies  that  build  on
the scientific products of the universities. Unlike the Domestic Discretionary budget,
the  assets  of  the  private  sector  do  grow  with  GDP,  and  industrial  investment  in
R&D  has  consequently  increased  much  more  rapidly  than  the  federal  contribu-
tion.’’[2]

Impact of Bayh-Dole

Bayh-Dole recognized a fundamental reality—that companies are the primary en-
gine  for  technology  commercialization  and  the  primary  channel  for  getting  new
products  to  market  for  the  benefit  of  society.  Neither  the  government  nor  univer-
sities  can  or  should  fulfill  those  roles.  So,  in  order  to  develop  nascent  inventions
from  the  university  and  deliver  them  as  new  products  to  the  market  place  compa-
nies are an essential partner. By giving universities the right to take title to inven-
tions from federally funded research and the obligation to try to commercialize those
inventions through licensing, the Bayh-Dole Act provided the legal framework to fa-
cilitate  the  transfer  of  technology  from  universities  to  industry.  This  has  undoubt-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

edly  benefited  the  United  States.  Since  universities  were  allowed  to  set  licensing
fees  and  royalties  and  to  keep  all  the  licensing  revenue  Bayh-Dole  also  created  the
expectation  that  universities  should  control  intellectual  property  and  generate  in-
come  from  their  inventions.  As  financial  pressures  on  universities  have  increased
the  prospect  of  filling  the  funding  gap  through  licensing  revenue  is  very  attractive.
However,  although  licensing  income  has  grown  steadily  as  university  technology
transfer offices have licensed significant numbers of inventions, the total net licens-
ing  revenues  reported  by  universities  to  the  Association  of  University  Technology
Managers  are  not  sufficient  to  fill  the  research  funding  gap.  In  fact,  the  licensing
income  is  only  about  one  third  of  the  total  research  funding  that  the  same  univer-
sities  are  receiving  from  industry  (Figure  3).[3]  Thus,  it  seems  that  the  best  inter-
ests  of  the  universities  will  not  be  served  by  trying  to  increase  licensing  revenue
at the expense of research funding from industry.

Influence of Bayh-Dole on University-Industry Research Collaborations

Bayh-Dole  has  undoubtedly  fostered  some  university-industry  collaborations  but

it has had the unintended consequence of impeding many more.

Bayh-Dole  has  enabled  licensing  transactions  and  some  new  research  to  support
the  transfer  of  the  inventions.  For  instance,  when  a  company  licenses  a  university
invention that resulted from federal funding it may choose to engage the faculty in-
ventor  in  follow-on  research  to  further  develop  or  refine  the  invention  for  commer-
cial  practice.  This  is  more  likely  to  happen  when  the  licensee  is  a  small  company
with limited internal research and development capabilities.

Bayh-Dole  has  not,  however,  fostered  research  partnerships—those  in  which  a
company  is  not  seeking  to  license  an  existing  university  invention  but,  rather,  to
engage  a  faculty  member  and  his  or  her  students  to  perform  research  of  interest
to  the  company.  In  those  research  partnerships  the  company  provides  the  funding
for  the  research  (including  university  overhead),  frames  the  research  problem,  and
may provide other resources to the university project such as company-generated re-
search or testing results, proprietary technical, business or market information, non-
commercial  samples  or  prototypes,  access  to  company  facilities,  and  consultation
with  company  researchers.  In  return,  the  faculty  member  and  student(s)  have  an
interesting real-world research problem to work on and usually the right to publish
the  research  results.  These  company-sponsored  projects  thereby  support  the  edu-
cational, research, and information dissemination missions of the university.

There  is  a  fundamental  difference  between  federally  funded  research  and  com-
pany  funded  research.  In  the  former  case  the  funding  comes  from  tax  dollars  so  it
is  reasonable  to  promote  a  use  of  resulting  inventions  in  a  manner  that  generally
benefits society. That societal benefit comes in two ways: invention licensing income
provides financial support for the university and successful commercialization of in-
ventions  brings  new  products  to  the  public.  The  university,  the  licensee,  and  tax
payers  all  benefit.  In  the  latter  case,  that  of  company  sponsored  research,  the  re-
search funding comes from the company’s owners or shareholders and not U.S. tax-
payers  in  general.  Company  profits  pay  for  the  research  investment,  and  company

owners/shareholders  expect  this  investment  to  produce  a  return  which  generally
comes from a competitive advantage for its products in the market place.

U.S. universities have taken the position that virtually all privately sponsored re-
search  is  at  least  ‘‘touched’’  in  some  way  by  federal  funds  and,  therefore,  subject  to
the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  By  this  reasoning  it  then  follows  that  the  university,  not  the
sponsor,  should  own  and  control  any  inventions  resulting  from  the  sponsored  re-
search  and  that  the  university  should  be  free  to  license  these  inventions  as  it  sees
fit. This very broad interpretation seems to be in conflict with both the stated inten-
tion of the Act and the language of the implementing regulations. In fact, the policy
and objective section of the Bayh-Dole Act lists, among others, the following two ob-
jectives:  to  promote  collaboration  between  commercial  concerns  and  nonprofit  orga-
nizations,  including  universities  and  to  promote  the  commercialization  and  public
availability  of  inventions  made  in  the  United  States  by  United  States  industry  and
labor.[4]  The  section  of  the  implementing  regulation  which  defines  its  scope  states:
‘‘To the extent that a non-government sponsor established a project which, although
closely  related,  falls  outside  the  planned  and  committed  activities  of  a  government-
funded  project  and  does  not  diminish  or  distract  from  the  performance  of  such  ac-
tivities,  inventions  made  in  performance  of  the  non-government  sponsored  project
would  not  be  subject  to  the  conditions  of  these  regulations.  An  example  of  such  re-
lated  but  separate  projects  would  be  a  government  sponsored  project  having  re-
search  objectives  to  expand  scientific  understanding  in  a  field  and  a  closely  related
industry  sponsored  project  having  as  its  objectives  the  application  of  such  new
knowledge to develop usable new technology.’’[5]

Before  beginning  a  company-sponsored  research  project  the  university  and  spon-
sor  generally  execute  a  research  agreement  that,  among  other  things,  determines
how any inventions that may occur will be treated. As mentioned above U.S. univer-
sities  generally  claim  ownership  of  inventions  made  by  their  faculty  and  students
in  the  course  of  performing  research  sponsored  by  a  company.  The  research  agree-
ment terms typically offered by U.S. universities give the sponsor a time-limited op-
tion to negotiate a license for the invention and require the research sponsor to pay
patenting  costs.  The  sponsor  has  to  pay  for  the  research  and  pay  for  the  patenting
without  any  guarantee  that  it  can  obtain  a  license  at  a  reasonable  cost.  In  fact,  if
the  sponsor  and  university  cannot  reach  agreement  on  the  value  of  the  invention
and  licensing  terms  then  the  university  is  free  to  license  the  invention  to  another
company,  even  a  competitor  of  the  research  sponsor.  This  is  indeed  a  ‘‘nightmare
scenario’’  for  the  company  sponsoring  the  research  because,  although  it  framed  the
research  problem  and  paid  for  the  research  activity,  the  resulting  invention  could
give  a  competitive  advantage  to  its  competitor!  Because  of  these  risks  and  uncer-
tainties  many  companies  hope  that  no  inventions  result  from  their  sponsored  re-
search at U.S. universities. This is an unfortunate situation since it limits the scope
of the research partnerships and the potential benefit from them, for all parties.

For industries like my own (the chemical industry) patents are critical to business
success. The cost of taking an invention from concept to commercial product is very
high  and  the  probability  of  success  is  low.  It  is  not  unusual  for  development  and
commercialization  to  take  10  to  15  years.  Construction  of  a  world-scale  chemical
plant  costs  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  Products  and  plants  have  a  long  life
cycle.  Most  chemical  companies  are  unwilling  to  make  such  a  large  investment  un-
less they have the protection provided by ownership or exclusive control of the sup-
porting  product  and  process  patents.  They  are  also  unwilling  to  make  these  invest-
ments if their licensing fees and royalty obligations make the profit margins too low.
Effects of the Increasing Globalization of Research

Global  competition  is  an  inevitable  consequence  of  capitalism  and  free  trade,  two
of the foundations of the U.S. economy. U.S. companies must produce products that
are  better  or  less  expensive  than  those  produced  by  competitors  in  order  to  stay  in
business.  U.S.  companies  also  want  to  access  to  foreign  markets  in  order  to  grow.
These  and  other  factors,  (fast,  reliable,  and  inexpensive  global  telecommunications
and  air  travel  to  name  a  few)  have  led  U.S.-based  companies  to  expand  their  re-
search,  manufacturing,  and  marketing  assets  abroad.  This  expansion  leads  natu-
rally  to  the  establishment  of  research  partnerships  with  universities  located  in  the
same regions as the company’s research or manufacturing facilities.

At  the  same  time  companies  are  finding  that  research  partnerships  with  foreign
universities offer a distinct advantage with regard to intellectual property use. Most
foreign universities, in both the developed and developing world, readily provide the
research  sponsor  with  exclusive  or  controlling  access  to  inventions  resulting  from
the  research.  Such  exclusivity  comes  through  a  variety  of  treatments  of  inventions
ranging from outright assignment of ownership to the sponsor to joint ownership to
granting  of  an  exclusive  license.  In  most  cases,  the  exclusive  access  is  provided  in

return for payment of the cost of the research and the cost of obtaining the patent.
In some cases, the company sponsor pays an additional, modest, predetermined fee.
Figures  4  and  5  provide  data  to  support  the  observation  that  foreign  universities
provide  more  favorable  intellectual  property  terms  to  research  sponsors.  In  2003
Dow  compared  the  intellectual  property  terms  from  more  than  one  hundred  spon-
sored  research  agreements  between  Dow  and  universities  around  the  world.  Figure
4 shows that in 69 percent of agreements with U.S. universities the university took
title  to  sole  inventions  (those  made  by  faculty  or  students  in  the  course  of  per-
forming the research sponsored by Dow). In contrast, Figure 5 shows that in 85 per-
cent  of  agreements  with  foreign  universities  sole  university  inventions  were  as-
signed to Dow or Dow was made a joint owner.

It  has  also  been  Dow’s  experience  that  it  is  much  faster  and  easier  to  negotiate
a  research  agreement  with  foreign  universities.  Not  only  does  this  allow  research
projects to get started in a timely manner but it also reduces the transactional costs
associated  with  the  negotiation.  In  2002  Dow  measured  the  average  cycle  time  for
executing  a  research  agreement  with  U.S.  universities.  We  found  that,  on  average,
it took over five months from the time that the Dow researcher and faculty member

finalized  the  research  plan  until  both  parties  signed  the  research  agreement.  The
most  time-consuming  step  was  negotiating  the  intellectual  property  terms.  In  some
cases  we  were  not  able  to  reach  an  agreement,  and  we  just  walked  away  from  the
project.  In  contrast,  when  we  set  up  agreements  with  universities  outside  the  U.S.
most  negotiations  were  quite  fast  and  easy,  being  completed  in  a  few  weeks  rather
than many months.

The  high  quality  of  research  being  performed  at  many  universities  outside  the
U.S.,  the  favorable  intellectual  property  terms  that  these  same  institutions  offer  to
research sponsors, and the relative speed and ease of negotiating the supporting re-
search agreements makes it increasingly attractive for companies in the U.S. to set
up  more  of  their  research  partnerships  with  universities  abroad.  At  a  recent  meet-
ing  of  the  External  Technology  Directors  Network,  a  working  group  within  the  In-
dustrial  Research  Institute,  members  of  the  network  conducted  a  straw  poll  to  find
out  whether  member  companies  were,  indeed,  increasing  the  amount  of  their  spon-
sored  research  being  done  abroad.[6]  Of  the  23  companies  represented  at  the  meet-
ing 17 responded that they are doing more of their sponsored research with foreign
universities  than  they  did  in  the  past.  Of  the  17  who  responded  in  the  affirmative,
nine agreed that either better intellectual property terms and/or ease of negotiating
the  agreements  were  major  reasons  for  their  decision  to  do  more  work  with  foreign
universities.
Influence of Bayh-Dole on Academic Collaborations and the Broad Dissemi-

nation of Knowledge

Bayh-Dole  has  had  both  positive  and  negative  influences  on  academic  collabora-
tions and dissemination of information. Academic collaborations are fostered by the
fact that all universities have clear and equal standing with regard to their faculty’s
inventions  that  come  from  collaborations  in  which  each  party  receives  funding  di-
rectly from the Federal Government. The situation is more complicated when there
are joint inventions or when funding flows from one university to another since each
party strives to maximize its rights to intellectual property.

Perhaps  the  most  serious  impediment  to  academic  collaboration  occurs  when  a
university  fails  to  make  research  results  or  materials  available  to  the  rest  of  the
research  community.  Material  transfer  agreements  between  institutions  have  be-
come very difficult to negotiate. Some universities have elected to patent and license
research tools that result from federally funded research. It is hard to make a com-
pelling  argument  that  society  is  better  served  by  limiting  access  of  the  research
community to research tools developed with federal funding. Such tools have a lim-
ited number of potential users in the research community and don’t have to be com-
mercialized  in  order  to  be  useful.  Patent  protection  is  not  needed  because  little  or
no  investment  is  required  to  make  the  tools  available  for  others  to  use.  Putting  re-
search  tools  into  the  public  domain  satisfies  the  intent  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  with
regard  to  public  benefit.  Generating  income  and  limiting  access  appear  to  be  the
main reasons for universities to patent and license research tools.[7]
Changes in Bayh-Dole Legislation Needed to Promote U.S. Economic Devel-

opment

U.S. competitiveness and, hence, U.S. economic development will be adversely im-
pacted if no improvements are made in the climate for university-industry research
and  development  partnerships.  The  U.S.  economic  engine  cannot  be  fully  engaged
and functional if the three main components of the technology enterprise (Industry,
Universities,  and  Government  Laboratories)  do  not  work  together  effectively  to  in-
vestigate  science  and  translate  technology  into  new  products.  U.S.  companies  with
technology-based  products  will  do  more  and  more  of  their  research  collaborations
with  foreign  universities.  The  potential  impact  on  U.S.  competitiveness  of  such  a
shift is well described in the report from The National Academies, Rising Above the
Gathering Storm.[8] Many individuals and organizations, such as the University-In-
dustry  Demonstration  Partnership,  are  working  to  lower  the  barriers  to  research
collaborations  between  universities  and  companies  in  the  U.S.  but  there  are  still
some  practices  and  expectations  regarding  intellectual  property  as  well  as  some
statutory and regulatory issues that are problematic.

The Bayh-Dole Act, largely through misinterpretation or misapplication, is offered
as one of the main reason why universities must own inventions resulting from com-
pany-sponsored  research  and  should  have  the  freedom  to  license  these  inventions
as  they  choose.  This  problem  could  be  mitigated  by  the  addition  of  language  which
further  clarifies  the  intent  of  Congress  relative  to  university  research  supported
with  private,  rather  than  government,  funding.  In  particular,  clarification  of  cir-
cumstances  under  which  private  and  federal  funding  of  related  research  can  exist
simultaneously  without  Bayh-Dole  rights  and  obligations  being  triggered  would  be

very helpful. It would also be very helpful to change some of the tax code provisions,
mainly Revenue Procedure 97–14 (recently superseded by Revenue Procedure 2007–
47)  which  creates  a  safe  harbor  for  universities  relative  to  their  tax-exempt  bonds
only as long as they do not give preference in licensing foreground inventions to an
industry sponsor of research. Finally, some of the economic pressures on universities
which  cause  them  to  try  to  maximize  their  licensing  revenue  could  be  relieved  by
raising or eliminating the federal cap on overhead rates.

Although the focus of today’s hearing is on how Bayh-Dole has affected university-
industry relations it is worthwhile to remember that Bayh-Dole also applies to com-
panies  that  receive  research  funding  directly  from  government  agencies.  A  white
paper  prepared  by  the  Integrated  Dual-use  Commercial  Companies  (IDCC)  organi-
zation  makes  the  following  observations  and  recommendations:[9]  ‘‘Several  aspects
of the Bayh-Dole Act represent major barriers preventing most technology rich com-
mercial  companies  from  even  considering  performing  R&D  with  the  Government
when there could be laboratory developments with Government funding with signifi-
cant  commercial  application.  Some  of  the  concerns  raised  regarding  the  Bayh-Dole
Act  include  the  inability  to  keep  a  patentable  invention  a  trade  secret,  the  breadth
of  the  Government-purpose  license,  march-in  rights,  and  the  broad  definition  of
‘‘subject  invention,’’  which  includes  inventions  conceived  (and  possibly  even  pat-
ented)  prior  to  entering  into  the  funding  agreement,  but  first  actually  reduced  to
practice under the funding agreement. Other concerns are the mandatory disclosure,
election  and  filing  requirements  for  subject  inventions,  which  can  potentially  result
in  forfeiture  of  title  to  the  inventions  if  the  requirements  are  not  timely  followed.
An  additional  concern  is  the  Preference  for  U.S.  Industry  requirement,  which  pro-
hibits  the  contractor  from  granting  an  exclusive  license  to  use  or  sell  a  subject  in-
vention in the U.S. unless the licensee agrees that any product embodying the sub-
ject  invention  will  be  substantially  manufactured  in  the  U.S.  These  concerns  have
resulted  in  recommendations  from  both  Government  and  industry  that  they  be  ad-
dressed.’’[10]

‘‘Most  of  these  industry  concerns  could  be  simply  addressed  by  amending  Section
35 U.S.C.  § 210(c) to provide that if a funding agreement is made with a contractor
that  is  subject  to  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  (35  U.S.C.  §§ 200–212),  any  rights  of  the  Gov-
ernment  or  obligations  of  the  contractor  relating  to  patents  described  in  35  U.S.C.
§§ 202–204,  may  be  negotiated  between  the  Government  and  the  contractor  to  re-
duce such Government rights or contractor obligations, if the head of the contracting
activity determines that the interest of the Government and the general public will
be  served  thereby.  This  same  right  to  negotiate  reduced  Government  rights  or  re-
duced  contractor  obligations  relating  to  patents  would  apply  to  those  contractors
that are large businesses and that are subject to the Statement of Government Pat-
ent Policy issued on February 18, 1983.’’[11]

In summary, the Bayh-Dole Act is an important piece of legislation that has pro-
duced many benefits. The unintended negative impact on research collaborations in-
volving  industry,  universities  and  government  can  be  mitigated  through  relatively
minor changes in the law and related regulations.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  WAYNE  C.  JOHNSON,  VICE  PRESIDENT,
WORLDWIDE  UNIVERSITY  RELATIONS,  HEWLETT-PACKARD
COMPANY
Mr.  JOHNSON.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished
Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to speak
with you today on the subject of Bayh-Dole, the next 25 years.

I  am  Wayne  Johnson,  Vice  President  of  University  Relations,
Worldwide,  from  Hewlett-Packard  Company.  My  focus  is  on  bring-
ing  universities  and  industry  together  to  work  collaboratively,  for
mutual benefit and for our innovation system.

I  have  been  working  in  this  area  for  over  20  years,  representing
companies  such  Raytheon,  Microsoft,  and  now  Hewlett-Packard.
For  the  past  three  years,  I  have  been  working  on  the  cross-indus-
try,  cross-university  efforts  at  GUIRR,  the  Government  University
Industry  Research  Roundtable,  part  of  the  National  Academies
here  in  Washington.  I  have  been  leading  one  of  the  efforts  at
BASIC,  the  Bay  Area  Science  and  Innovation  Consortium  in  Cali-
fornia,  and  I  am  a  founding  sponsor  of  the  UIDP,  the  federal  Uni-

versity  Industry  Demonstration  Partnership,  also  here  in  Wash-
ington.  The  goal  of  these  efforts  has  been  to  remove  the  barriers
that  prevent  universities  and  industry  from  working  together,  and
to understand deeply the partnership models and operating param-
eters  that  will  work  successfully,  given  the  myriad  of  challenges
that both parties face.

Personally, I care deeply about U.S. universities and their ability
to  work  with  industry.  I  believe  that  ability  of  these  two  types  of
partners  to  come  together  around  important  problems  and  inter-
esting  research  areas  is  a  very  important  part  of  our  future,  and
our ability to be successful and to lead the world in innovation.

Now,  you  can  hear  me.  I  have  three  key  points  and  two  rec-

ommendations for you to consider. First, my key points.

My  first  point  is  that  the  information  technology  or  IT  industry
does  not  believe  in  ‘‘home  run  patents.’’  Last  week,  one  of  my  col-
leagues went to a nearby office supply store, and purchased an HP
Color printer, color copier, scanner, and photo printer all in one for
$79.99.  Today’s  products,  such  as  PCs,  PDAs,  printers,  and  cell
phones,  et  cetera,  are  sophisticated,  complex  aggregations  of  hard-
ware,  software,  systems,  and  services.  Each  one  contains  literally
hundreds  of  patented  concepts  and  implementations.  And  yet,  no
single  concept  or  implementation  makes  or  breaks  the  success  of
the  product.  Each  key  concept  can  be  designed  around  or  imple-
mented  differently.  Therefore,  the  sort  of  home  run  patents,  which
have  high  commercial  value,  rarely  exist,  and  do  not  drive  innova-
tion in the IT industry.

My second point is, one of the key original goals of the Bayh-Dole
legislation was to ‘‘promote collaboration between industry and uni-
versities.’’ I am here to tell you today that unfortunately, it has had
the  opposite  effect.  One  of  my  research  colleagues  has  told  me  at
HP  Labs  that  he  has  been  able  to  set  up  research  collaboration
with  elite  universities  in  Russia  within  a  few  days  and  just  a  few
phone calls. Our experience in negotiating collaborative agreements
with  U.S.  universities  is  that  it  can  take  as  long  as  two  years  or
more,  if  indeed,  we  ever  reach  such  an  agreement  over  IP  rights.
These types of situation have led to what we call a silent breaking,
where many companies in our industry simply walk away, because
it is too costly and takes too long to reach an agreement.

My third point is that while intellectual property rights, patents,
and strong IP position have been critical to our success in the past,
it  is  innovation  and  collaboration,  together  with  strong  relation-
ships and interactions between U.S. universities and industry, that
will drive our future success.

Our  success  depends  on  the  ability  of  universities  to  cultivate
and  develop  world  class  talent  through  high  quality  education  of
students,  and  this,  in  turn,  depends  on  the  relevant  and  chal-
lenging educational experiences between universities and industry.
The shift away from collaboration is one of the reasons why the si-
lent  breaking  represents  such  a  threat  to  our  long-term  success  in
the  IT  industry  and  to  the  health  of  our  innovation  system  in  the
United States. And Bayh-Dole in its present form does not address
the  particular  issue  of  interaction,  collaboration,  and  strong  rela-
tionships.

Here  are  my  two  recommendations.  My  first  recommendation  is
that  we  don’t  feel  that  Bayh-Dole  should  be  changed,  for  two  rea-
sons.  Bayh-Dole  provides  IP  protection  for  industry  and  business
models  that  depend  on  a  few  enabling  key  patents  for  competitive
advantage,  and  as  has  been  mentioned  previously,  certainly  in  the
pharmaceutical  industry.  It  also  establishes  a  uniform  approach  to
ownership  and  licensing  of  intellectual  property,  superior  to  the
IPA process that it replaced.

In addition, my second recommendation is to launch a new focus
on  innovation,  one  that  makes  this  country  a  hotbed  of  collabora-
tion,  one  that  highlights  the  differences  between  invention  and  in-
novation,  and  that  understands  that  superior  value  can  be  created
through  innovation,  one  that  enacts  policies  to  bring  innovation  to
the forefront, both for our industry’s success and America’s success
for  the  next  25  years.  When  we  look  into  the  future  from  an  IT
company  perspective,  we  believe  that  the  focus  on  patents  will
wane over time, and many of the things that drive innovation, from
our  experience,  are  in  the  details,  and  those  details  are  not  about
technology licensing.

Thank you for your attention and the opportunity to testify here

today.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WAYNE C. JOHNSON

Introduction

Good  afternoon  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee.
Thank-you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  on  the  subject  of  ‘‘Bayh-
Dole—The Next 25 Years.’’

I’m  Wayne  Johnson,  Vice-President  of  University  Relations,  Worldwide,  from
Hewlett-Packard  Co.  My  focus  is  on  bringing  universities  and  industry  together  to
work collaboratively, for mutual benefit and for our innovation system.

I’ve  been  working  in  this  area  for  over  20  years,  representing  companies  such  as
Raytheon,  Microsoft,  and  now  Hewlett-Packard.  For  the  past  three  years,  I’ve  been
working  on  the  cross-industry,  cross-university  efforts  at  GUIRR  (the  Government
University  Industry  Research  Roundtable),  part  of  the  National  Academies  here  in
Washington.  I’ve  been  leading  one  of  the  efforts  at  BASIC  (the  Bay  Area  Science
and  Innovation  Consortium  in  California),  and  I’m  a  founding  sponsor  of  the  UIDP
(the  federal  University  Industry  Demonstration  Partnership,  also  here  in  Wash-
ington.) The goal of these efforts has been to remove the barriers that prevent uni-
versities and industry from working together, and to understand deeply the partner-
ship models and operating parameters that will work successfully, given the myriad
of challenges that both parties face.

Personally,  I  care  deeply  about  U.S.  universities  and  their  ability  to  work  with
industry.  I  believe  that  ability  of  these  two  types  of  partners  to  come  together
around important problems and interesting research areas is a very important part
of  our  future,  and  our  ability  to  be  successful  and  to  lead  the  world  in  innovation.
Outline of Key Points and Recommendations
Key Points

Before getting into the details of my testimony this afternoon, there are three key

points and two recommendations that I’d like for you to consider.

Please note the opinions expressed here are from an information technology indus-
try perspective, and are not intended to reflect the issues and concerns of other indus-
tries  such  as  Life  Sciences,  etc.,  which  we  understand  to  have  very  different  needs.
1. We  in  the  information  technology  (‘‘IT’’)  industry  do  not  believe  in  ‘‘Home-Run’’

Patents
• Today’s products are sophisticated, complex aggregations of software, systems
• Each  one  contains  literally  hundreds  of  patented  concepts  and  implementa-

and services (such as the personal computer, PDA or cell phone)

• Yet  no  one  concept  or  implementation  ‘‘makes  or  breaks’’  the  success  of  the

product

• ‘‘Home-Run’’ patents do not drive innovation in the IT industry

2. One of the key, original goals of the Bayh-Dole legislation was. . .to promote col-

laboration between industry and universities. . .
• Unfortunately,  it  has  had  just  the  opposite  effect  of  what  was  in-

tended

3. While  intellectual  property  (IP)  rights,  patents,  and  a  strong  IP  position  have

been critical to our success in past,
• It  is  innovation,  collaboration,  and  strong  relationships  and  interactions  be-

tween U.S. universities and industry that will drive our future success

• And  Bayh-Dole,  in  its  present  form,  does  not  address  the  particular

issues of interaction, collaborations, and strong relationships

Recommendations
1. At this time, we recommend that Bayh-Dole not be changed.

• Bayh-Dole provides IP protection for industries and business models that de-

pend on a few enabling patents for competitive advantage

• It also establishes a uniform approach to the ownership and licensing of intel-

lectual property, far superior to the IPA process that it replaced

2. In  addition,  we  recommend  a  new  focus  on  innovation—one  that  makes  this

country a ‘‘hot-bed’’ of collaboration
• One that distinguishes the differences between invention and innovation, and
that  understands  the  superior  value  that  can  be  created  through  innovation
• And one that enacts policies to bring innovation to the forefront, both for our

industry’s success and for America’s success during the next 25 years

• When  we  look  into  the  future  from  the  IT  industry  perspective,  we  believe
that the focus on patents will wane. Many of the things that drive innovation,
from  our  experience,  are  in  the  details,  and  those  details  are  not  about  tech-
nology licensing.

Innovation & the IT Industry Perspective

The  information  technology  (‘‘IT’’)  industry  has  followed  a  unique  evolution

throughout the past five decades.

Initially,  the  efforts  of  university  researchers  and  companies  were  largely  decou-
pled, with universities focusing on basic research, and companies working to develop
‘‘stand-alone’’  products.  Innovation  efforts  were  typically  focused  on  creating  tech-
nologies that would enable new categories of products, such as printers, calculators,
computers, etc.

As technology advanced and products grew more sophisticated in their capability,
the focus of innovation moved to combining these products into systems. An example
of such a system is the personal computer which integrates processors, memory, and
video into an extremely useful, powerful, and low-cost system.

And  as  these  systems  became  more  advanced,  they  became  linked  together  into
networks,  creating  a  widely  available  information  infrastructure.  The  emphasis  in
innovation is now on how to create services that make sophisticated tasks both pos-
sible  and  pervasive,  creating  a  whole  new  wave  of  communication  and  information
capabilities enabling the Internet, cell phones, iPods, etc.

Innovation  in  today’s  world  requires  the  combined  efforts  of  multiple  companies,
partnering  across  multiple  industries  to  bring  a  competitive  offering  to  the  cus-
tomer.  Even  the  seemingly  simple  printer  shown  here  involves  multiple  research
disciplines and numerous sciences in its creation, design, and development.

In this new model of product development, ‘‘goodness’’ is equated with the success
of  many  varied  players  in  the  resulting  ecosystem,  all-the-while  competing  with
each other to make contributions to and gain the loyalty of the end-consumer. Their
primary mode of operation is innovating, creating more novel and unique value, and
driving prices down so that more people can benefit from the products and services
being  offered.  For  example,  printers  that  once  only  printed  black  &  white  text  and
sold for hundreds of dollars, can now print color documents and photographs, make
color copies, and scan documents, all-in-one, and sell for $79.99. People using print-
ing  services  enjoy  the  experiences  of  sharing  photos  with  family  and  friends  any-
where  in  the  world,  as  their  printer  interfaces  with  the  Internet  and  uploads  their
favorite photos automatically for sharing with others.

The  pace  of  innovation  in  the  IT  industry  is  accelerated,  marked  by  very  rapid
time-to-market. Product development cycles are 9–15 months and product life times
are in the range of three to six months. The phrase that probably best characterizes
this  industry  and  its  unrelenting  pace  of  new  value  creation  is  ‘‘innovate  or  die.’’
The Myth of ‘‘Home-Run’’ Patents

‘‘Home-run’’  patents  are  those  which  are  key  enablers  for  unique  products  or
spawn  whole  new  industries,  and  represent  massive  potential  licensing  revenue
windfalls for a university. Some universities have built their technology transfer of-
fices  (TTOs)  around  the  belief  that  the  next  ‘‘home-run’’  patent  is  imminent,  eager
to  capture  a  significant  windfall.  Other  universities  have  been  driven  by  the  fear
of  being  known  as  the  TTO  that  let  the  ‘‘big  one’’  get  away.  This  set  of  beliefs  is
reinforced by the universities’ TTO focus on licensing revenue as a measure of their
success.

These  beliefs  are  driving  the  universities  to  behave  as  if  the  major,  if  not  only,
mechanism  for  transferring  new  knowledge  is  through  patenting  and  licensing.
However,  there  are  many  mechanisms  for  disseminating  new  knowledge  out  from
universities, including student hiring, publications, conferences, informal exchanges,
visiting researchers, etc.

For  IT  companies,  the  perspective  about  intellectual  property  is  quite  different.
Most  IT  products  involve  the  combined  use  of  hundreds  of  patented  ideas.  Many  of
these  patents  are  incremental  advances  and  concepts  for  which  there  is  no  single
patent  that  defines  a  key  enabling  technology.  Due  to  the  large  number  of  patents
in a typical IT product, companies will not pursue royalty-bearing licenses with uni-
versities. Also, the IP in IT products is unlikely to be clearly unique and defensible,
since  other  approaches  are  generally  feasible,  making  it  difficult  and  expensive  to
protect.  For  many  IT  companies,  the  role  of  IP  is  to  accelerate  product  de-
velopment,  rather  than  to  enable  it.  It’s  not  about  the  value  of  a  single  patent
(since  it  is  relatively  easy  to  design  around  any  IP  that  might  present  a  problem);
it’s  more  about  the  exchange  of  ideas  and  collaborative  research  that  builds  out  an
ecosystem which utilizes the technologies being developed.

As a company in the IT industry, we don’t believe in ‘‘home-run’’ patents, and we
don’t  believe  that  they  exist  (for  us).  Innovation  is  driven  by  the  knowledge  that  is
created  through  collaboration  and  the  flow  of  ideas,  by  working  with  leading  re-
search  centers  and  doing  good  research,  and  by  hiring  well-educated  students  into
the research and development activity.

Bayh-Dole: Its Goals and Results

As  we  have  reviewed  the  original  intent  of  the  Bayh-Dole  legislation,  three  of  its

major goals are identified as—

1. to  promote  the  utilization  of  inventions  arising  from  federally  supported  re-

search and development,

2. to encourage maximum participation of small business firms in federally sup-

ported research and development efforts,

3. to  promote  collaboration  between  commercial  concerns  and  nonprofit  organi-

zations, including universities

Promoting Industry-University Collaboration

In this testimony, we will take an in-depth look goal #3 (above), from the perspec-

tive of the IT industry.

How  well  did  Bayh-Dole  do  in  terms  of  its  objective  to  promote  collaboration?
From  the  results  that  have  been  observed  over  the  past  10  years,  we  would  have
to  give  it  a  poor-to-failing  grade.  Unfortunately,  much  of  what  has  actually  hap-
pened has been exactly the reverse of what was intended, when the legislation was
written.

1. Bayh-Dole  has  contributed  to  shifting  the  focus  and  attention  of  joint  re-
search  towards  rights,  ownership,  and  the  licensing  of  intellectual  property,
and away from collaboration, partnership, and innovation.

2. Bayh-Dole  has  accelerated  the  building  of  a  bureaucracy—the  technology
transfer offices in U.S. universities. Since the inception of Bayh-Dole in 1980,
more than 65 U.S. universities have put into place technology transfer offices
as  a  way  of  dealing  with  the  increasing  emphasis  on  monetizing  intellectual
property, the belief in ‘‘home-runs,’’ and the shortfalls in university funding.
3. The  existence  of  these  technology  transfer  offices  has,  in  turn,  constrained
(not  amplified)  the  flow  of  knowledge  and  research  outward  from  univer-
sities.  The  TTOs  have  focused  almost  exclusively  on  patenting  and  licensing
revenues,  and  in  many  cases  operate  independently  of  the  industrial  liaison
offices,  the  sponsored  projects  offices,  and  other  mechanisms  that  univer-
sities use to promote engagement and interaction with industry. One notable
exception  to  this  phenomenon  is  where  the  TTOs  have  been  combined  with
Industrial  Liaison  Offices  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  engagement
model  between  universities  and  industry  (e.g.,  the  UC–Berkeley  IPIRA
model.)

4. The  increased  focus  on  rights,  licenses,  and  revenues  has  strained  the  al-
ready  challenging  and  tenuous  relationships  that  have  existed  between  U.S.
companies  and  universities.  This  shift  in  focus  towards  ‘‘intellectual  prop-
erty’’ has made it more difficult for these two parties to work together. It has
fueled  mistrust,  escalated  frustration,  and  created  a  misplaced  goal  of  rev-
enue  generation,  which  has  moved  the  universities  and  industry  farther
apart than they’ve ever been.

5. The  process  of  negotiating  agreements  that  specify  how  to  work  together  in
joint research areas have turned into disagreements over IP rights and own-
ership, and taken up to 2+ years to converge, if indeed both parties ever
come  to  mutual  agreement.  Often,  both  parties  give  up,  disengage  from  the
negotiation  process,  and  resolve  never  to  try  and  engage  with  each  other
again in joint collaborations.

6. The  inability  to  reach  agreement,  and  the  frustration,  mistrust,  and  dam-
aged  relationships  over  IP  rights  have  contributed  to  a  ‘‘silent  breaking,’’
where  companies  decide  that  it’s  too  costly  and  too  much  trouble  to  try  and
work  with  universities.  Companies  then  ‘‘walk  away’’  and  find  other  part-
ners such as the elite universities in Russia, India, and China, who are more
flexible  in  their  working  arrangements,  are  easier  to  work  with,  and  are
more agile and speedy in their negotiations.

7. If  effect,  what  Bayh-Dole  has  done,  is  rather  than  create  a  congressionally-
mandated  reason  for  universities  and  industry  to  work  together  for  mutual
benefit  and  increased  societal  benefit,  is  to  organize  a  ‘‘shot-gun  wedding,’’
where  both  parties  are  trying  to  do  the  right  thing,  but  it  simply  doesn’t
work  because  the  focus  is  misplaced  on  rights,  ownership,  and  revenue  gen-
eration.

While the overall practice of collaboration has eroded significantly in the past dec-
ades,  it’s  important  to  note  that  not  all  universities  have  jumped  on  the  IP  band-

52

wagon and focused on IP solely as a source of revenue for their institutions. In our
experience  there  are  some  universities  that  can  strike  an  appropriate  balance  be-
tween  fostering  collaborative  relationships  with  industry,  and  at  the  same  time
managing the rights and patents associated with IP development. Universities such
as Purdue, Georgia Tech, UC–Berkeley, and Stanford seem to know how to balance
all of these needs, and still keep a focus on becoming the partners of choice for U.S.
companies.

Innovation, Globalization, and New Interaction Models

While universities and the IT industry have been experiencing increasing relation-
ship difficulties during the past decade, the world situation has been changing dra-
matically.

When Bayh-Dole was created, it was enacted to address a particular situation and
need,  at  the  time.  Now,  27  years  later,  the  U.S.  IT  industry  (as  well  as  others)  is
challenged with a new set of circumstances—the forces of globalization, rapid time-
to-market, increasing sophistication of products and services, and the need for both
rapid technological and market innovation.

With the Internet and the ready availability of global supply chains, we are expe-
riencing  an  unprecedented  ‘‘flattening’’  of  the  world  and  a  ‘‘leveling  of  the  playing
fields’’ which before were thought to be the exclusive purview of U.S. industry. The
expanded information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, together
with the increased emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
education globally, has created a situation where literally anyone anywhere can cre-
ate an innovative product or service, and bring it to market quickly. In this modern,
interconnected  world,  new  companies,  new  industries,  and  whole  new  ecosystems
are created in a fraction of the time that it used to take for them in past to become
established.

The  ‘‘speeding  up’’  of  the  world’s  rapid  pace  of  development  is  requiring  that  we
find  new  models  and  ways  of  working  together,  to  match  the  accelerating  pace  of
global innovation.

In light of this, we observe the following situations:

1. Today,  most  new  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  compa-
nies  (even  small  ones  of  5–10  employees)  are  structured  to  be  ‘‘global,’’  from
the  outset.  One  does  not  have  to  be  a  big  company,  to  be  a  global  company
anymore.  For  example,  every  university  graduate  with  entrepreneurial  aspi-
rations  can  start  out  their  career,  linking  with  fellow  students  from  other

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

53

countries,  and  is  enabled  to  access  design,  development,  and  manufacturing
facilities on a global basis.

2. Global  companies  can  work  with  anyone,  anywhere  on  the  planet,  and  are
not  constrained  to  working  with  university  partners  in  a  single  country,  re-
gion,  or  location.  They  can  choose  partners  who  have  knowledge,  ideas,  in-
sights,  and  interesting  research  to  offer,  and  who  are  not  constrained  or
slowed down by bureaucracies focused on rights, IP ownership, and licensing
revenues.

3. As  the  need  for  speed  and  rapid  innovation  has  increased,  university  TTOs
have slowed down and impeded the process of collaboration, and made their
institutions  increasingly  more  unattractive  and  difficult  to  work  with.  This
has,  in  turn,  encouraged  companies  to  find  other  university  partners  to  en-
gage  with,  typically  outside  the  U.S.  It  has  shifted  the  sponsorship  of  re-
search,  the  vigorous  multi-disciplinary  interactions,  and  the  flow  of  ideas  to
universities in other countries. In terms of innovation and the future of suc-
cess of U.S. industry, this is a most distressing development.

4. The decreasing interaction and engagement of U.S. universities with compa-
nies  threatens  to  reduce  the  relevance  of  their  research  and  the  quality  of
their students, and therefore erodes one of the major foundations of the U.S.
national innovation ecosystem.

The Technology Transfer Model

While  companies  go  in  search  of  willing  partners  who  are  easy  to  work  with  on
a  global  basis,  universities  find  that  they  are  becoming  increasingly  isolated  from
industry  engagement,  and  are  more  reliant  than  ever  on  government  funding  and
sponsorship.

Perhaps even more worrisome is that the focus on intellectual property of the past
two  decades  has  had  the  unintended  effect  of  institutionalizing  an  engagement
model which is now obsolete in the modern world.

In  the  old  way  of  operating,  research  ideas  were  conceived  of,  developed,
prototyped,  and  then  shown  to  industry  partners  for  evaluation,  further  engage-
ment, and hopefully transferred into one or more product development efforts. Usu-
ally,  universities  worked  independently  during  the  early  years  of  technology  re-
search, and then when they ‘‘had something’’ that was tangible and interesting, they
went searching for industrial partners.

This  research-then-transfer  model  (more  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘‘technology
transfer’’)  worked  well  20+  years  ago  when  the  pace  of  innovation  was  a  lot  slower
than  it  is  today,  when  globalization  was  relatively  unheard  of,  and  when  the  world
was  a  lot  less  competitive  in  the  drive  to  bring  valuable  products  and  services  to
market quickly. Back then, we were afforded the luxury of creating something first,
and  then  searching  for  an  application  of  what  was  hoped  to  be  a  ‘‘valuable  tech-
nology.’’

Collaborative Engagement Models

As  the  pace  of  innovation  has  quickened,  particularly  in  the  past  decade,  the  re-
search-then-transfer  model  has  been  quietly  rendered  obsolete.  Today,  the  develop-
ment and engagement models of choice favor multiple partners from the outset, en-
gaging  in  the  free-flow  of  ideas,  simultaneously  envisioning  many  different  applica-
tions  for  their  work,  and  creating  different  types  of  products  and  systems  that  the
technologies might be used in.

These new collaborative interaction models are inherently more parallel, more vig-
orous  and  engaging,  and  involve  multiple  partners  (even  competitors)  working  in
tandem  on  their  own  ideas  of  what  particular  idea  or  innovation  that  will  provide
new  value  to  the  marketplace.  They  can’t  want  for  a  single  contribution  to  be  re-
searched,  perhaps  with  a  wrong  or  misguided  target  application  in  mind,  and  then
have to redo the research later.

Some of the key points around innovation and interaction models are:

1. Technology  transfer  is  an  inherently  serial  process,  takes  too  long,  usually
directs research along a single vector of target application, and runs the risk
of  missing  the  more  useful  applications  of  technology,  when  the  work  is  at
a ‘‘transferable stage.’’

2. The idea of ‘‘valuable technology sitting on the shelf’’ at major research uni-
versities  is  flawed.  Much  of  the  value  coming  out  of  the  innovation  process
lies  in  the  targeting  of  early  stage  ideas  to  target  applications  and  uses  of
the  technology.  This  is  not  where  universities  can  engage  from  a  position  of
strength.

3. Technology  transfer  focuses  institutions  on  ‘‘things’’—rights,  patents,  li-
censes, etc. These are late-stage, after-the-fact indicators that something val-
uable has been going on between interested parties.

4. Collaborative  models  are  more  parallel,  intensive,  open  processes  that  gen-
erate a flow of ideas, and calibrate directions and likely results quickly. They
involve  multiple  research  perspectives,  and  often  result  in  a  particular  idea
or  concept  being  effectively  utilized  in  multiple  places,  across  multiple  dis-
ciplines, and enabling multiple commercialization efforts to be undertaken si-
multaneously.

5. Collaborative  models  engage  universities  and  industrial  partners  at  the  be-
ginning  of  the  process,  there  ideas  are  soft  and  malleable,  and  could  go  in
a  myriad  of  directions.  With  multiple  partners  present,  concepts  and  ideas
can  be  developed  in  many  different  directions,  simultaneously  from  the  be-
ginning.

6. Collaborative  models  are  more  efficient—they  minimize  the  risk  of  devel-
oping a research work on one particular line of application, and then finding
out late in the process that the wrong path was chosen.

7. Collaborative  models  focus  on  people,  capability  development,  the  flow  of
ideas.  They  foster  relationship-building,  help  to  build  trust,  and  avoid  the
traps of negotiating who owns what, and what monies should flow to whom,
before the work is ever done.

This shift to more interactive and engaging research and development models fa-
vors  the  processes  of  rapid  knowledge  creation,  the  free  flow  of  ideas  and  concepts,
the parallel development of multiple target applications of an idea or technology. In
this  new  model,  no  single  idea  or  concept  becomes  the  driving  force  behind  compel-
ling  new  value—it  now  takes  a  whole  array  of  new  ideas  and  concepts  woven  to-
gether  in  such  a  way  as  to  make  the  new  product  or  system  revolutionary  at  the
time  it’s  interested.  As  we  stated  earlier,  no  single  idea  can  be  a  ‘‘home  run,’’  and
the  value  of  a  single  patent  without  a  whole  series  of  others  that  complement  it,
is essentially trivial.

University-Industry Relationships

Another important consequence of becoming overly focused on IP, rights, and own-
ership,  is  the  damage  that  is  done  to  long-term  industry-university  relationships.
Universities  have  a  wide  range  of  support  needs.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the  IP-fo-
cused negotiations which impede collaboration, and the escalating frustrations, mis-
trusts,  and  ill-will  that  result  from  not  being  able  to  reach  agreement,  have  caused
incredible  damage  to  these  relationships.  Yet  the  damage  goes  far  beyond  the
bounds of the sponsored research agreement itself.

In actuality, the funding that sponsored research generates for many universities,
is  usually  only  a  very  small  portion  of  their  total  income.  Yet  the  negative  percep-
tions,  the  ill-will,  and  the  memories  that  are  generated  from  failed  negotiations—
the silent breaking, and the walk-away behaviors—have significant spill-over effects
into  other  sources  of  sponsorship  for  the  university.  Long  after  a  single  negotiation
has  failed,  the  reluctance  to  participate  in  other  areas  of  support  such  as  gifts,
grants,  endowments,  research  contracts,  consulting  arrangements,  and  others  lives
on.  The  negative  consequences  to  the  universities  on  a  long-term,  aggregate  basis
dwarf  any  amount  of  money  that  could  ever  be  recouped  through  IP  licenses  and
royalties.

Summary

For  the  IT  industry  to  be  successful  in  the  coming  decades,  we  must  distinguish
between  inventions  (which  take  us  quickly  into  IP  rights,  ownership,  patents,  and
licensing  discussions)  and  innovation  which  is  the  life-blood  of  the  IT  industry.  We
must  recognize  that  there  are  different  business  models  operating  across  different
industry  sectors,  and  while  a  strong  IP  position  may  adequately  cover  the  needs  of
some  industries,  the  need  for  a  focus  on  innovation,  collaboration,  and  new  eco-
system development goes largely unaddressed.

To make the IT industry competitive, we need to begin by creating strong support
for industry-university collaboration, and begin to put into place what I call Innova-
tion 3.0—the next version of a rapid, vigorous, and healthy innovation environment.
We  must  help  make  U.S.  universities  the  global  partners  of  choice,  in  this  new,
global and ‘‘flattened’’ world, and shift the focus of attention back to people, the flow
of ideas, and mutually beneficial interactions. Bayh-Dole, as it is presently written,
does  not  accomplish  this,  but  rather  shifts  attention  away  from  people  and  ideas
(the raw materials of innovation) to IP, rights, licenses, and the ownership of things.
Bayh-Dole also makes a dangerous leap, in that it confuses invention with innova-
tion,  and  reinforces  a  language  and  a  vocabulary  solely  around  rights  and  owner-
ship.  These  elements  are  late-stage  artifacts  of  an  obsolete  technology  transfer
model, which runs the risk of putting America out of the loop of a competitive, glob-
al marketplace where value is created and true innovation takes place independent
of any country, policy, region, or institution.

With  Bayh-Dole  and  other  legislation  we’ve  tried  to  address  the  protection  of  in-
ventions through a strengthening of IP policy. It’s time to do something for the other
half  of  the  equation—Ignite  Innovation,  the  life-blood  of  new  industries  and
the foundation of economic development.

And that time is now!
Thank-you for your attention, and for the opportunity to testify here today.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Johnson.  Professor

Lemley, please proceed.
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  MARK  A.  LEMLEY,  PROFESSOR  OF  LAW,
STANFORD  LAW  SCHOOL;  DIRECTOR,  STANFORD  PROGRAM
IN LAW, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY
Dr.  LEMLEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  distinguished  Members
of  the  Subcommittee.  I  am  Mark  Lemley.  I  teach  at  Stanford  Law
School. I want to make it clear that I am here speaking on my own
behalf,  and  not  Stanford’s.  In  fact,  I  suspect  I  will  say  at  least  a
few things that will horrify them.

Bayh-Dole fundamentally changed the way universities approach
technology  transfer,  and  you  can  see  that  best  in  the  statistics.
Universities  obtain  16  times  as  many  patents  today  as  they  did  in
1980.  Now,  everybody  is  getting  more  patents,  but  still,  univer-
sities’  share  of  all  patents  in  the  United  States  is  more  than  five
times greater than it was before Bayh-Dole.

Universities  license  those  patents  for  upwards  of  $1  billion  a
year. The effects of this surge in university patenting, I think, have
been  both  good  and  bad.  On  the  positive  side,  I  think  that  the
Bayh-Dole Act has had the effect, has achieved the goal, of encour-
aging university inventors to patent inventions, and to license pat-
ents  to  private  companies  that  can  make  use  of  them.  So,  the  risk
that  inventions  were  languishing  in  universities,  that  they  were
never  commercialized,  has  I  think  been  addressed  in  significant
measure  by  Bayh-Dole.  And  particularly  in  the  biomedical  area,
these  university-private  partnerships  have  been  responsible  for  a
number  of  significant  breakthroughs,  and  I  think  we  are  going  to
hear about at least one in a moment.

On  the  negative  side,  universities,  I  think,  too  often  look  to  the
short run bottom line, how do I maximize my revenue from licens-
ing  fees,  and  setting  their  licensing  priorities,  not  to  the  broader
picture  of  how  can  I  best  improve  technology  transfer  for  the  ben-
efit of society. Particularly in the information technology industries
we  have  just  heard  about,  there  is  a  sense  that  university  patents
are  interfering  with,  rather  than  promoting  the  dissemination  of
technical knowledge to the world at large, that universities are fil-
ing  lawsuits  to  try  to  restrict  the  use  of  this  technology,  and  that
they are adversaries, not partners, in the deployment of technology.
There  is,  in  fact,  the  situation  has  gotten  so  bad  that  one  infor-
mation  technology  official  has  publicly  referred  to  universities  as
‘‘crack  addicts,’’  driven  by  ‘‘small-minded  tech  transfer  offices  ad-
dicted  to  patent  royalties.’’  Now,  I  don’t  think  the  situation  is  as
bad as all that, or at least not as bad as all that most of the time,
but  the  fact  that  there  is  this  widely  divergent  view  between  dif-
ferent  industries  suggests  that  we  have  got  an  issue,  or  a  problem
we  need  to  address,  and  the  testimony  here,  the  very  different  ap-
proaches we have heard so far, I think, is evidence of that.

The  need  for  Bayh-Dole  is  greatest  in  the  biomedical  industry,
where  the  FDA  approval  process,  and  the  hundreds  of  millions  of
dollars,  and  the  years  of  regulatory  approval  that  are  required  to
develop  new  drugs,  mean  that  just  coming  up  with  an  idea  for  a
drug  is  only  the  very  beginning  of  the  process,  and  that  if  there
isn’t  exclusivity  associated  with  that  drug,  no  one  is  going  to  take

58

it  all  the  way  through  the  regulatory  environment.  By  contrast,  in
a  field  like  computer  software,  exclusivity  not  only  often  isn’t  nec-
essary, but it can actively interfere with the use of the technology.
The solution, I think, is largely in the hands of universities, rath-
er  than  legislative  response  to  Bayh-Dole.  Universities  need,  I
think,  to  take  a  broader  view  of  their  role  in  technology  transfer.
Technology  transfer  from  universities  ought  to  have  as  its  goal
maximizing the social impact of technology, not simply maximizing
a university’s licensing revenue.

Sometimes,  that  means  patenting  an  invention  and  granting  an
exclusive license. That is going to be true in a lot of cases, in which
there  is  a  long,  expensive  commercialization  process  that  has  to
happen after the invention has been made. Sometimes, it will mean
patenting  the  invention  but  granting  nonexclusive  licenses  to  all
comers. That is especially true of keystone or enabling technologies,
the  kinds  of  technologies  that  open  up  an  entirely  new  field.  So,
university patenting was responsible for breakthroughs in chimeric
DNA  and  in  DNA  manipulation,  in  monoclonal  antibodies.  Those
patents were all licensed on a nonexclusive basis to all comers, and
I think the industry benefited from that. If we decided that one and
only  one  company  can  have  control  over  recombinant  DNA  tech-
nology,  or  one  and  only  one  company  can  have  control  over
monoclonal  antibodies,  I  think  the  biotechnology  industry  would
not be as vibrant and as diverse as it is today.

And  sometimes,  I  think,  promoting  social  technology  transfer
means foregoing patent protection altogether. So, universities have
an  obligation,  a  role,  to  try  to  figure  out  not  just  what  maximizes
the  bottom  line,  but  what  actually  is  going  to  achieve  the  goal  of
commercialization.

The  government  has  an  important  oversight  role  in  this  process.
I  think  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  contains  various  provisions  designed  to
limit  exclusive  licensing  of  federally  owned  inventions,  and  to  step
in  to  require  reasonable  licensing  of  university  owned  inventions,
so-called  march-in  rights  in  particular  circumstances.  So,  my  rec-
ommendation,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  is  not  that  we  rewrite  Bayh-
Dole,  not  that  we  change  it  in  fundamental  ways,  but  that  univer-
sities  need  to  pay  attention  to  the  characteristics  of  the  invention
and the technology, and that if they don’t, there is an oversight role
for  government  to  step  in  and  make  sure  that  the  licensing  occurs
on the most reasonable and most favorable terms.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK A. LEMLEY

Summary of Testimony

The Bayh-Dole Act was enacted in 1980 in order to make it easier for universities
to  transfer  technology  to  the  private  sector,  and  to  solve  the  perceived  problem  of
inventions  made  in  universities  languishing  there,  rather  than  being  deployed  to
solve real world problems.

Bayh-Dole  fundamentally  changed  the  way  universities  approach  technology
transfer.  Universities  obtain  16  times  as  many  patents  today  as  they  did  in  1980,
and  their  share  of  all  patents  is  five  times  greater  than  it  was  before  Bayh-Dole.
They license those patents for upwards of $1 billion a year in revenue.

The effects of this surge in university patenting have been both good and bad. On
the  positive  side,  it  seems  clear  that  the  Act  has  achieved  its  goal  of  encouraging
university  inventors  to  patent  those  inventions  and  to  license  those  patents  to  pri-

vate  companies  that  can  make  use  of  them.  Particularly  in  the  biomedical  area,
these university-private partnerships have been responsible for a number of signifi-
cant breakthroughs.

On  the  negative  side,  universities  have  too  often  looked  to  the  short-run  bottom
line  in  setting  their  licensing  priorities,  granting  exclusive  rights  to  breakthrough
technologies  to  businesses  that  may  not  be  best  suited  to  exploit  them  for  the  ben-
efit of society as a whole. Particularly in the information technology (IT) industries,
there  is  a  sense  that  university  patents  are  interfering  with  rather  than  promoting
the dissemination of technical knowledge to the world at large. The growing number
of  university-filed  and  university-sponsored  patent  lawsuits  in  the  IT  industries,
many  in  association  with  non-practicing  entities  (or  so-called  ‘‘patent  trolls’’),  has
added  to  the  sense  in  those  industries  that  universities  are  often  adversaries,  not
partners, in the deployment of technology.

The  problem  in  my  view  is  not  with  Bayh-Dole  per  se,  but  with  the  way  it  has
sometimes  been  implemented  without  sufficient  sensitivity  to  the  very  different
characteristics of different industries. The need for Bayh-Dole is greatest in the bio-
medical  industry,  where  the  FDA  approval  process  and  the  hundreds  of  millions  of
dollars  required  to  develop  new  drugs  means  that  few  will  see  an  idea  through  to
fruition without the promise of exclusivity. By contrast, in a field like computer soft-
ware, exclusivity not only isn’t necessary but may actively interfere with the use of
the technology.

Universities  should  take  a  broader  view  of  their  role  in  technology  transfer.  Uni-
versity  technology  transfer  ought  to  have  as  its  goal  maximizing  the  social  impact
of technology, not merely maximizing the university’s licensing revenue. Sometimes
this will mean patenting an invention and granting an exclusive license. Sometimes
it  will  mean  granting  nonexclusive  licenses  to  all  comers.  And  sometimes  it  should
mean  foregoing  patent  protection  altogether.  For  Bayh-Dole  to  work  as  intended,
universities  must  look  beyond  their  short-run  profit  and  think  about  what  is  best
for society as a whole.

The  government  has  an  important  oversight  role  in  this  process.  Bayh-Dole  con-
tains various provisions intended to limit the exclusive licensing of federally owned
inventions  (35  U.S.C.  § 209)  and  to  step  in  to  require  reasonable  licensing  of  a  uni-
versity-owned  invention  (35  U.S.C.  § 203).  To  date,  those  provisions  have  not  been
used  to  exercise  effective  oversight  over  university  licensing.  But  they  could  be.
What  is  required,  then,  is  not  new  legislation  as  much  as  greater  vigilance  on  the
part of both universities and federal funding agencies to ensure that university pat-
enting serves its intended purpose and is not misused. Congress should exercise its
oversight  function  to  ensure  that  this  happens,  but  it  does  not  need  to  change  the
Act.

If  Congress  were  to  rewrite  Bayh-Dole,  the  one  change  I  would  encourage  is  the
removal of the provisions (such as 35 U.S.C. § 204) that discriminate against foreign
businesses and international trade. They are the product of an earlier era of protec-
tionism, and seem out of place in the global marketplace in which we find ourselves.
Doubtless  American  universities  have  ample  incentive  to  support  local  businesses;
they  should  not  be  precluded  from  licensing  their  inventions  to  whoever  can  best
provide the benefits of those inventions to the American consumer.

Are Universities Patent Trolls?1

I. Complaints About University Patents

MARK A. LEMLEY2

The  confluence  of  two  significant  developments  in  modern  patent  practice  leads

me to write a paper with such a provocative title.3
A. The Rise of Patent Holdup

The first development is the rise of hold-up as a primary component of patent liti-
gation and patent licensing. You can call this the troll problem if you like.4 I prefer
to  think  of  it  as  the  hold-up  problem.  But  whatever  we  call  the  problem,  it  seems
quite  clear  that  more  and  more  patent  litigation  is  being  filed,  and  significant
money is being made, by non-manufacturing entities—entities that don’t themselves
actually  make  the  product  and  in  many  cases  don’t  actually  engage  in  developing
the  technology  very  far  at  all.  Many  of  these  entities  also  engage  in  tactics  that
allow them to lay low and then take a mature industry by surprise once participants
in  the  industry  have  made  irreversible  investments.5 The  holdup  or  troll  problem
is particularly significant in component-driven industries, notably information tech-
nology  (IT),  where  the  problem  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  a  product  developer
such as Intel that must aggregate thousands of different inventions into its semicon-
ductor  chip  is  vulnerable  to  hold-up  by  any  one  of  the  thousands  of  inventors.  Pat-
ent  owners  in  those  component  industries  can  capture  far  more  than  the  intrinsic
value  of  their  invention,  because  under  long-standing  patent  law  patent  owners
have  the  right  not  just  to  sue  and  get  paid  the  percentage  of  the  value  contributed
by  their  invention  but  to  enjoin  the  sale  of  Intel’s  entire  chip  until  it  can  design  a
new  chip  that  avoids  infringing  that  patent,  something  that  might  take  years  and
require  investing  billions  of  dollars  in  a  new  fab.6 These  factors  have  combined  to
produce  the  growth  industry  of  the  new  millennium:  patent  hold-up.  Hundreds  of
companies are engaging in efforts to capture not just the value of what you contrib-
uted to as an invention, but a disproportionate share of somebody else’s product.
B. The Rise of University Patenting

The second development in the last three decades is the massive surge in univer-
sity  patenting.7 Universities  obtained  sixteen  times  as  many  patents  in  2004  as  in

4 The term ‘‘patent troll’’ was coined in the late 1990s by Peter Detkin, then assistant general
counsel  at  Intel,  to  refer  to  patent  owners  who  hide  under  bridges  they  did  not  build  to  pop
out  and  demand  money  from  surprised  passers-by.  I’ll  talk  about  some  definitions  of  ‘‘patent
troll’’ at the end of this paper.

1980,8 and universities had 1000 times as many technology transfer offices.9 In sig-
nificant measure this is a result of the Bayh-Dole Act,10 which not only permits but
encourages  university  patenting  of  federally-funded  inventions.  But  it  is  also  a  re-
flection of the growth in importance of patents more generally. Those university pat-
ents  don’t  sit  dormant;  universities  license  them  to  companies  for  over  $1  billion  a
year in revenue.11 Patents are now a significant contributor to some university bot-
tom  lines.  And  importantly,  more  and  more  university  patents  are  patents  on  the
very  earliest  stages  of  technology.  It  is  universities,  perhaps  not  surprisingly  given
their role in basic research, who are patenting the basic building blocks in new tech-
nologies. We see this with particular force in nanotechnology, an area I have studied
in detail.12 Universities, which account for one percent of patents on average across
all  fields,  account  for  12  percent  of  all  patents  in  nanotechnology,  and  more  than
two-thirds  of  what 
in
nanotechnology.13 The other area in which university patents are significant is bio-
technology, where they represent about 18 percent of all patents.14 As a result, uni-
versities have met a much bigger role in patenting than they ever have before.

At  the  confluence  of  these  developments  is  a  growing  frustration  on  the  part  of
industry with the role of universities as patent owners. Time and again, when I talk
to  people  in  a  variety  of  industries,  their  view  is  that  universities  are  the  new  pat-
ent  trolls.  One  even  referred  publicly  to  universities  as  ‘‘crack  addicts’’  driven  by
‘‘small-minded tech transfer offices’’ addicted to patent royalties.15

Why  such  a  vehement  reaction?  One  important  reason  is  that  universities  are
non-manufacturing  entities.  They  don’t  sell  products.  I  don’t  think  that  necessarily
means they’re bad actors. But it does mean that their incentives in dealing with the
patent  system  align  in  many  ways  with  those  of  private-sector  patent  licensing
shops.  One  of  the  assumptions  corporations  in  patent-intensive  industries  (such  as
IT or increasingly biotechnology) make about patenting is symmetry: that if a com-
petitor sues you for infringement you can sue them back. That symmetry deters pat-
ent  litigation  in  the  industries  in  which  it  operates.16 But  that  symmetry  doesn’t
exist for non-manufacturing entities. Universities aren’t going to cross license. They
aren’t  going  to  trade  their  patents  away  in  exchange  for  a  cross-license,  because
they  don’t  need  a  license  to  other  people’s  patent  rights.17 Instead,  they  want
money. And to an IT general counsel who deals with dozens of threats of suit every
year,  any  patent  owner  in  that  position  looks  an  awful  lot  like  a  patent  troll.  In
short, there’s definitely a sense among industry representatives that universities are
greedy when it comes to licensing patents.

Compounding  the  perception  of  greed  is  that  university  patent  licensing  offices
have  strong  institutional  incentives  to  grant  exclusive  rather  than  non-exclusive  li-

8 Before  1980,  universities  worldwide  obtained  about  250  U.S.  patents  a  year.  In  2003,  they
obtained  3933  patents,  an  almost  sixteen-fold  increase.  See  Bernard  Wysocki  Jr.,  College  Try:

censes, for various reasons. First, exclusive licensing royalty rates are almost always
higher  than  non-exclusive  rates.  That’s  not  surprising,  since  the  licensee  is  getting
more from an exclusive license than from a non-exclusive license. From the perspec-
tive  of  a  tech  transfer  office  focused  on  this  quarter’s  bottom  line,  that  higher  roy-
alty  rate  is  hard  to  turn  down.  Second,  the  companies  with  which  they  are  negoti-
ating  often  want  exclusivity.18 They  are  especially  likely  to  get  it  if  the  company
in  question  is  a  faculty-organized  startup.19 Finally,  exclusive  licensees  often  pay
the cost of patent prosecution, a relatively small savings but an immediate one that
impacts  the  tech  transfer  office’s  bottom  line.  The  result  is  that  the  overwhelming
majority of university patent licenses are exclusive. In the nanotech licenses I stud-
ied  (just  a  few  dozen,  admittedly),  between  95  and  100  percent  of  the  university  li-
censes granted were exclusive.20 One example from the biotechnology field of an ex-
clusive  license  to  an  enabling  technology  is  WARF’s  field-exclusive  license  to  Geron
of  all  stem  cell  patents,  granted  shortly  before  those  stem  cell  patents  became  ex-
traordinarily valuable because the Bush administration obstructed the development
of new stem cell lines.21

In  fact,  however,  this  higher  royalty  rate  may  or  may  not  translate  into  a  higher
revenue  stream  for  the  university.  Whether  it  does  depends  on  the  nature  of  the
technology  being  licensed.  For  certain  basic  building  blocks—what  I  call  ‘‘enabling
technologies’’—opening  up  licensing  to  many  innovators  who  can  develop  different
uses  will  generate  substantial  improvements,  while  giving  an  exclusive  license  to
only  one  person  will  generate  fewer  improvements.22 And  exclusive  licenses  can
block  any  development  of  a  technology  if  the  licensee  doesn’t  deliver.23 Even  if  in
the long run non-exclusive licensing of many technologies actually increases univer-
sity  revenue,  in  the  short  run  a  university  tech-transfer  office  seeking  to  maximize
the amount of money that the office generates will tend to grant exclusive licenses.
Exclusive  licenses  aren’t  necessarily  bad—a  point  I  discuss  below—but  they  raise
concerns about the effective diffusion of new technologies.

A final reason for industry concern about university patenting is that universities
are  increasingly  enforcing  their  patents.  Recent  years  have  seen  high-profile  cases
litigated  to  judgment  by  the  University  of  California,  the  University  of  Rochester,
Harvard,  MIT,  Columbia  and  Stanford,  and  suits  filed  by  many  other  universities.
One  notable  example  is  Eolas  Technologies  v.  Microsoft,24 in  which  the  University
of  California  licensed  a  software  patent  to  a  company  that  really  does  look  like  a
patent troll however you want to define that term, and then shared with that com-
pany a jury award of $535 million against Microsoft.25

Universities,  recognizing  patent  licensing  and  litigation  as  an  important  revenue
source in the modern environment, have been active in politics, largely in alignment
with the life sciences industries (from which most university patent revenue comes)

in  opposing  most  of  the  effective  pieces  of  draft  patent  reform  legislation.  Univer-
sities helped argue for eliminating from the 2005 patent reform bill any restrictions
on  both  injunctive  relief  and  continuation  applications.  The  most  recent  version  of
the  patent  reform  bill26 also  faced  attacks  from  some  universities  seeking  to  elimi-
nate the move to first inventor to file, which doesn’t benefit them because they tend
to file later than commercial entities, and eliminate the creation of prior user rights,
which also don’t benefit them since they aren’t generally using the inventions. These
university  preferences  shouldn’t  be  surprising,  at  least  if  we  view  the  university  as
a  profit-maximizing  entity  rather  than  one  concerned  with  the  social  good.  Like
other non-manufacturing entities, after all, universities are first and foremost intel-
lectual property (IP) owners, not IP licensees.

The result is a felt sense among a lot of people that universities are not good ac-
tors  in  the  patent  system.  Given  the  difficulty  anyone  has  had  in  defining  a  patent
troll,  it  is  easy  to  move  from  that  conclusion  to  the  idea  that  universities  are  trolls
too. I think it is worth questioning that leap. There is something going on here, but
I’m not sure that it is reasonable to equate university patents with private troll be-
havior.  The  common  refrain  in  complaints  about  patent  trolls  is  that  they  are  not
contributing  anything  to  society,  but  rather  obtaining  and  asserting  patents  cov-
ering technology independently developed by defendants. The question remaining to
be  answered  is  whether  the  same  is  true  of  university  patents.  In  other  words,  it’s
worth asking whether society needs or wants university patents at all.
II. Do We Need University Patents?

From  the  perspective  of  the  university,  one  justification  for  university  patents
may be to fund universities. More money is better than less money, and the billion
dollars a year in licensing is a substantial new revenue source for universities, most
of  which  goes  to  research  and  some  of  which  goes  to  education.  If  you  think  those
things  are  under-funded  in  our  society  today,  as  I  tend  to  believe,  generating  that
additional  revenue  sounds  useful  in  a  way  that  paying  for-profit  licensing  shops
doesn’t. But that additional revenue is not costless. It’s money that comes out of in-
dustry pockets, and at least some of that money otherwise would have gone into in-
dustry research and development, or to selling better products, or to providing prod-
ucts more cheaply. So it’s worth thinking about the costs of patents as a pure wealth
transfer  mechanism.  And  most  economists  would  agree  that  if  our  goal  is  to  ade-
quately  fund  higher  education,  patent  litigation  is  an  inefficient  way  of  doing  so.27
Further, there are some who claim that a culture of patenting imposes costs on the
university  or  on  academic  research  more  generally.28 University  scientists  focused
on  patenting  may  delay  or  even  forego  publication  in  favor  of  IP  protection.29 And
there  is  a  substantial  literature  on  how  the  shift  to  university  patenting  has  actu-
ally  moved  universities  away  from  basic  research  and  towards  more  applied  re-
search  in  ways  that  are  arguably  bad  for  society  in  the  long  run.30 The  risk  is  not
so much that individual professors will change their research habits as that the de-
partments that grow and the hiring slots that become available will go to those who
engage  in  revenue-generating  applied  research.  Of  course,  government  and  private
foundation  grants  can  come  with  conditions  attached,  and  can  also  direct  research
to particular ends, so in practice they aren’t perfect funding mechanisms either.

Why  else  might  society  need  university  patents?  The  classic  justification  for  pat-
ents—creating incentives to innovate—arguably isn’t nearly as important in the uni-
versity context as in the private sector. I think it unlikely that university scientists
would not do research or invent in the absence of patent protection. There are plen-
ty of other incentives for university scientists to engage in research, including curi-
osity,  academic  prestige,  and  tenure  and  promotion.  Further,  university  inventors
are  generally  funded  by  grants  or  departmental  revenue,  must  assign  their  rights

to  the  university,31 and  don’t  necessarily  see  any  tangible  benefit  from  university
patenting of their inventions. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean that patents have
no  additional  effect.  It  may  be  that  patents  generate  some  revenue  which  is  re-
funded to the researcher’s department and supports further research, and even that
the  prospect  of  that  additional  funding  motivates  some  research.  But  the  contribu-
tion  of  patents  to  university  incentives  to  innovate  seems  smaller  than  in  profit-
driven companies.

The final reason we might want university patents—and the argument that actu-
ally  prevailed  in  the  Congressional  debates  over  Bayh-Dole—is  the  commercializa-
tion  argument.  Unlike  the  classic  incentive  story,  commercialization  theory  argues
that it is not so much the act of invention but the act of turning that invention into
a  marketable  product  that  requires  investment  and  therefore  the  exclusion  of  com-
petition.32 According  to  this  theory,  university  inventions  will  languish  and  not  be
commercialized  unless  we  give  someone—initially  the  university,  but  presumably
eventually  a  private  company  to  which  the  right  is  licensed  or  transferred—control
over the invention and therefore incentive to invest in developing and marketing it.
This argument seems particularly strong with respect to university inventions, since
we  can  reasonably  expect  those  inventions  involve  more  basic  research,  and  there-
fore to be made at an earlier stage, than private inventions.

There is some debate as to whether the commercialization theory is actually true
of  university  inventions.  Mowery,  Nelson,  Sampat,  and  Ziedonis  have  a  very  inter-
esting book in which they suggest that Bayh-Dole was based on concerns that were
mis-  or  at  least  overstated.  They  argue  that  there  was  a  good  deal  of  technology-
transfer without university patents in the decades before Bayh-Dole, and that even
today  there  is  plenty  of  university  technology  transfer  that  occurs  in  the  absence
of patents.33 By contrast, the prevailing wisdom seems to be that university patents
increase commercialization, and therefore that Bayh-Dole has been a success.34 Cer-
tainly  they  increase  commercialization  deals  between  universities  and  companies,35
though it is hard to know the extent to which that simply reflects the fact that once
a  patent  issues  the  company  in  question  needs  a  license  in  order  to  commercialize
the technology.

My own view is that the validity of commercialization theory depends a great deal
on the industry in question and the particular nature of the technology. In the phar-
maceutical and biotechnology industries, where coming up with an invention is only
the  first  step  down  a  very  long  road  of  regulatory  process  that’s  going  to  take  hun-
dreds  of  millions  of  dollars  and  several  years,  the  commercialization  argument
makes some sense. The university generally isn’t going to engage in that regulatory
process,  and  arguably  we  need  to  give  somebody  exclusive  rights  to  induce  them  to
make  the  regulatory  investments  that  the  university  itself  isn’t  going  to  make.  We
give  the  right  to  the  university,  but  we  do  so  expecting  that  they  will  transfer  or
exclusively  license  that  right  to  a  private  company  that  will  recoup  the  hundreds
of  millions  of  dollars  they  spend  in  clinical  trials,  product  development,  and  mar-

keting.36 Other  industries  might  also  have  a  long  post-invention  development  cycle
and  therefore  be  good  candidates  for  commercialization  theory.  That  might  be  true
of  basic  building  block  technologies  like  nanotechnology,  where  we  expect  a  very
long  road  between  the  development  of  the  invention  and  the  ultimate  commer-
cialization,37 though it is likely too early to say for sure how nanotech will develop.
In these industries, Bayh-Dole is probably a good thing.

On  the  other  hand,  I’m  quite  confident  that  central  control  is  not  necessary  to
produce  commercialization  in  the  majority  of  other  industries.38 Bear  in  mind  that
the commercialization story is at base anti-market: it assumes, contrary to centuries
of  economic  learning,  that  ordinary  profit  motives  will  not  produce  efficient  alloca-
tion of resources and that we need to vest exclusive control of a technology or mar-
ket  in  one  actor  in  order  to  get  that  efficient  allocation.39 Even  if  we  think  that’s
true  in  the  pharmaceutical  or  biotechnology  industries  because  of  the  regulatory
barriers  to  entry  in  those  markets,  we  should  not  conclude  exclusivity  is  always  or
even  generally  required  to  encourage  a  company  to  bring  a  product  to  market.40 In
the  IT  industries,  and  even  in  industries  like  medical  devices,  there  is  no  reason
to believe that exclusive rights are necessary to encourage commercialization of the
technology.  It  is  true  even  in  those  industries  that  when  an  inventor  has  gotten  to
the point where she can patent something, there may still be development and mar-
keting work to be done. But we get plenty of both in a competitive marketplace be-
cause  the  companies  who  engage  in  product  development  and  marketing  can  reap
enough  of  the  benefits  of  that  investment  to  make  it  worthwhile.  And  indeed  we
have  seen  an  enormous  number  of  technologies  commercialized  out  of  universities
throughout the 20th Century without need of university patents. Think of the com-
puter, the world-wide-web, search engines, relational databases, and any number of
software programs.41

The  need  for  university  patents,  in  short,  depends  critically  on  the  technology  at
issue.  I  think  much  of  the  industry  frustration  with  the  role  of  university  patents
stems  from  the  failure  of  some  university  technology  transfer  offices  to  recognize
and  adapt  to  these  technology  differences.  As  noted  above,  technology  transfer  of-
fices  have  strong  incentives  to  maximize  revenue  from  patent  licensing.  To  achieve
this,  they  have  adopted  the  life  sciences  model,  where  exclusive  rights  and  patents
seem  to  make  sense  because  of  the  regulatory  delays,  as  their  general  approach  to
patent  licensing.  But  they  are  increasingly  using  it  in  software  and  other  informa-
tion technologies.42 The result is frustration on the part of industry counterparts in
industries  like  computers  or  telecommunications  that  are  more  interested  in  free-
dom to operate than in exclusive rights over a new technology. It may also be frus-
tration  on  the  part  of  tech  transfer  offices;  less  than  one  percent  of  all  university
patent  licenses  generate  over  $1  million  in  revenue.43 And  efforts  to  commercialize
the  rest  is  what  leads  to  a  lot  of  the  more  worrisome  patent  licenses  in  cases  like
Eolas.

36 Interestingly,  though,  even  industry  players  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  sometimes  la-
ment  university  reliance  on  exclusive  licensing.  See  Thomas  J.  Siepmann,  The  Global  Expor-
tation  of  the  U.S.  Bayh-Dole  Act,  30  U.  Dayton  L.  Rev.  236  (2004)  (quoting  Joshua  Kalkstein,
corporate counsel for Pfizer).

37 Lemley, supra note ¥¥, at 628–29.
38 Empirical  evidence  supports  the  conclusion  that  patenting  reduces  rather  than  increases
technology  diffusion  overall.  Murray  and  Stern  find  that  patenting  is  associated  with  reduced
citation to an academic publication associated with the patent. Fiona Murray & Scott Stern, Do
Formal Intellectual Property Rights Hinder the Free Flow of Scientific Knowledge? An Empirical
(working  paper  2005),  available  at  http://pa-
Test  of  the  Anti-Commons  Hypothesis

should be the opposite.

39 See  Mark  A.  Lemley,  Ex  Ante  Versus  Ex  Post  Justifications  for  Intellectual  Property,  71

U. Chi. L. Rev. 147 (2004) (making this point).

40 More  and  more  property  rights  scholars  seem  to  forget  the  benefits  of  a  market  economy.
Michael  Abramowicz,  for  instance,  claims  that  we  may  not  get  efficient  entry  of  Indian  res-
taurants  into  particular  neighborhoods  unless  we  grant  some  sort  of  regional  exclusivity.
Abramowicz,  supra  note  ¥¥,  at  ¥¥.  Maybe  he’s  right,  but  I  doubt  it.  The  market  has  worked
pretty well in the past, and we should be reluctant to forego its benefits unless we’re quite sure
that the alternative will be better.

III. Lessons From the University Patent Experience
A. Towards an Enlightened University Patent Policy

Universities  should  take  a  broader  view  of  their  role  in  technology  transfer.  Uni-
versity  technology  transfer  ought  to  have  as  its  goal  maximizing  the  social  impact
of technology, not merely maximizing the university’s licensing revenue.44 A univer-
sity  is  more  than  just  a  private  for-profit  entity.  It  is  a  public-regarding  institution
that  should  be  advancing  the  development  and  spread  of  knowledge  and  the  bene-
ficial  use  of  that  knowledge.  Sometimes  those  goals  will  coincide  with  the  univer-
sity’s  short-term  financial  interests.  Sometimes  universities  will  maximize  the  im-
pact of an invention on society by granting exclusive licenses for substantial revenue
to a company that will take the invention and commercialize it. Sometimes, but not
always. At other times a non-exclusive license, particularly on a basic enabling tech-
nology,  will  ultimately  maximize  the  invention’s  impact  on  society  by  allowing  a
large  number  of  people  to  commercialize  in  different  areas,  to  try  out  different
things and see if they work, and the like.45 Universities can still earn revenue from
nonexclusive licenses, and for enabling technologies they might even maximize their
revenue in the long-term by granting nonexclusive rather than exclusive licenses.46
University  policies  might  be  made  more  nuanced  than  simply  a  choice  between  ex-
clusive and nonexclusive licenses. For example, they might grant field-specific exclu-
sivity, or exclusivity only for a limited term, or exclusivity only for commercial sales
while  exempting  research,47 and  they  might  condition  continued  exclusivity  on
achievement  of  certain  dissemination  goals.48 Finally,  particularly  in  the  software
context,  there  are  many  circumstances  in  which  the  social  impact  of  technology
transfer  is  maximized  either  by  the  university  not  patenting  at  all  or  by  granting
licenses  to  those  patents  on  a  royalty-free  basis  to  all  comers.49 Open  source  soft-
ware development is one example, but hardly the only one.50

If  we  are  to  achieve  the  goal  of  maximizing  the  social  benefit  of  a  university  in-
vention  to  society,  universities  must  first  recognize  their  proper  role  in  society  and
how that role affects patent policies. An important first step in that education proc-
ess is to end the isolation of university technology transfer or licensing offices from
the rest of the university.51 If universities treat licensing offices as revenue genera-
tion  devices,  evaluated  on  how  much  money  they  bring  in  each  quarter,  the  result

44 For a similar view, see Robert E. Litan et al., Commercializing University Inventions: A Bet-

ter Way, NBER Working Paper (April 2007).

45 See  Lemley,  Nanotechnology,  supra  note  ¥¥,  at  ¥¥;  Ted  Sabety,  Nanotechnology  Innova-
tion and the Patent Thicket: Which IP Policies Promote Growth?, 15 Alb. L.J. Sci. & Tech. 477,
510–12 (2005) (both making this argument).

46 The  key  university  patents  on  enabling  technologies  in  biotechnology,  issued  to  Cohen  and
Boyer  for  the  creation  of  chimeric  organisms  and  to  Axel  for  methods  of  inserting  genes  into
a cell, were licensed nonexclusively because of NIH requirements. See Wysocki, supra note  ¥¥,
at A1. They made enormous sums of money for Stanford, UC, and Columbia, arguably because,
not in spite of, the nonexclusivity of the licenses. See Sally Smith Hughes, Making Dollars Out
of DNA: The First Major Patent in Biotechnology and the Commercialization of Molecular Biol-
ogy,  1974–1980,  92  ISIS  541,  570  &  n.77  (2001);  Wysocki,  supra  note  ¥¥,  at  A12.  Amy
Kapczynski  has  argued  that  open  licensing  may  be  profitable  for  universities  more  generally,
not  just  with  enabling  technologies.  Amy  Kapczynski  et  al.,  Addressing  Global  Health  Inequi-
ties: An Open Licensing Approach for University Innovations, 20 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1031, 1040
(2005). I am less persuaded by this broader argument.

47 For examples of such approaches, including Stanford’s and WARF’s, see Ritchie de Larena,

supra note ¥¥, at 1420.

48 Stanford  University  has  a  relatively  enlightened  university  technology  transfer  policy  that
uses  all  of  these  intermediate  mechanisms.  Conversations  with  Linda  Chao,  Stanford  Office  of
Technology  Licensing  (May  2006).  Stanford’s  official  policy  is  at  http://otl.stanford.edu/inven-
tors/resources/otlandinvent.html

49 For  a  general  argument  along  these  lines,  see  Brett  M.  Frischmann,  An  Economic  Theory
of  Infrastructure  and  Commons  Management,  89  Minn.  L.  Rev.  917  (2005).  See  Stanford  Office
of  Technology  Licensing  Policies,  http://otl.stanford.edu/inventors/policies.html#research  (‘‘In-
ventors  may  place  their  inventions  in  the  public  domain  if  they  believe  that  would  be  in  the
best  interest  of  technology  transfer’’).  And  some  have  argued  for  open  licensing  of  university
pharmaceutical inventions in the developing world. See, e.g., Amy Kapczynski et al., Addressing
Global  Health  Inequities:  An  Open  Licensing  Approach  for  University  Innovations,  20  Berkeley
Tech. L.J. 1031 (2005). By contrast, Arti Rai documents the difficulties scientists have had per-
suading universities to build an open source model for collaborative biotechnology research. See

will  be  university  patent  policies  that  are  not  always  or  even  often  consonant  with
the  ultimate  public  interest.52 The  problem  is  even  worse  if  universities  outsource
their  technology  transfer  functions  altogether  to  private  licensing  shops.53 If  a  uni-
versity  thinks  of  its  role  in  society  as  a  whole,  if  it  treats  patent  licensing  as  one
aspect  of  a  broader  technology  transfer  policy,  it  can  and  should  develop  more  en-
lightened  policies.  A  number  of  universities  have  taken  significant  steps  in  this  re-
gard, but more remains to be done.
B. Legal Constraints on Unenlightened Universities

If  universities  don’t  develop  such  policies  voluntarily,  society  may  have  other
mechanisms  to  ensure  that  university  patents  don’t  impede  innovation.  Federal
funding  agencies  can  play  a  role.  The  National  Institutes  of  Health  has  at  various
times in the past imposed mandates requiring universities to grant certain types of
licenses  to  their  work.54 The  Bayh-Dole  Act  permits  the  government  to  exercise
‘‘march-in  rights,’’  requiring  that  particular  patents  be  licensed  on  non-exclusive
terms.55 Alternatively,  as  universities  become  more  and  more  vulnerable  to  patent
infringement suits themselves,56 private sector patent owners may be able to create
some  of  the  symmetry  that  drives  cross-licenses  in  industries  like  semiconductors
by  obtaining  patents  that  universities  infringe  and  threatening  to  assert  them
against  any  university  who  sues  them  for  patent  infringement.57 These  measures
might  turn  out  to  be  necessary,  but  I’d  like  to  see  us  try  first  to  solve  the  problem
not  by  imposing  a  solution,  but  by  encouraging  universities  to  take  the  first  step
in recognizing their social responsibility associated with their patents.
C. Broader Lessons: Who Is a Patent Troll?

Finally, I think we can learn something about the raging debate over who’s a pat-
ent  troll  and  what  to  do  about  trolls  by  looking  at  university  patents.  Universities
are  non-practicing  entities.  They  share  some  characteristics  with  trolls,  at  least  if
the term is broadly defined, but they are not trolls. Asking what distinguishes uni-
versities  from  trolls  can  actually  help  us  figure  out  what  concerns  us  about  trolls.
One  of  the  differences  between  universities  and  private  licensing  shops  is  that  uni-
versities are by and large not engaged in hiding the ball, waiting until people have
developed an industry and then popping up and demanding a disproportionate share
of  royalties  based  on  irreversible  investments.58 There  are  occasional  examples  of
that,59 and they should be condemned, but it’s not the ordinary case with a univer-
sity license. Instead, most university licenses have a major technology transfer com-
ponent.  A  nonexclusive  patent  license  is  effectively  nothing  more  than  forbearance
from  suit  in  exchange  for  money.60 By  contrast,  most  university  licenses  give  the
licensee  not  just  the  right  to  avoid  a  lawsuit,  but  also  provide  valuable  know-how.
Indeed, many also involve continued work by the inventor, particularly if the license
is  to  a  start-up  and  is  exclusive.  That  sort  of  technology  transfer  is  something  we
want to encourage for reasons Rob Merges has explained: granting IP rights allows
us  not  to  be  constrained  by  a  particular  definition  of  the  firm  and  forced  do  all  of
our innovation in house. It allows us to have markets for technology.61 Markets for
technology contribute more to society than markets for litigation rights.62 University
patent  owners  aren’t  trolls  in  my  view  when  they  contribute  previously  unknown

52 See  Ritchie  de  Larena,  supra  note  ¥¥,  at  1416–17  (‘‘One  point  that  most  technology-trans-
fer  managers  agree  upon  is  that  it  is  not  wise  to  judge  a  university’s  technology-transfer  office
solely on licensing income.’’).

53 For example, the University of Colorado has outsourced much of its patent licensing to Com-

petitive Technologies Inc.

54 See Bernard Wysocki Jr., College Try: Columbia’s Pursuit of Patent Riches Angers Compa-
nies, WALL ST. J., Dec. 21, 2004, at A1 (noting that the NIH required Professor Axel at Colum-
bia  to  license  his  fundamental  patents  on  methods  of  inserting  genes  into  cells  nonexclusively
and at a reasonable royalty).

56 See, e.g., Madey v. Duke University, 307 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
57 There  may  be  practical  reasons  why  this  last  option  is  unlikely,  however.  See  Elizabeth  A.
Rowe, The Experimental Use Exception to Patent Infringement: Do Universities Deserve Special
Treatment? 57 Hastings L.J. 921, 940–44 (2006).

technology  to  society,  rather  than  just  imposing  costs  on  others  by  obtaining  and
asserting legal rights over inventions independently developed by others.63

In the abstract, I think we could successfully define patent trolls by distinguishing
between  cases  in  which  non-manufacturing  entities  license  only  the  right  not  to  be
sued from cases in which the patent owner actually engages in technology transfer.
But  that’s  only  in  the  abstract.  Were  a  court  ever  to  announce  such  a  definition,
it would immediately be gamed. All true trolls would start passing on some manda-
tory  know-how  along  with  their  patent  licenses,  in  order  to  avoid  being  categorized
as trolls.

What we ought to do instead is abandon the search for a group of individual com-
panies to define as trolls. We shouldn’t focus on the question of who is per se a bad
actor.  In  my  view,  troll  is  as  troll  does.  Universities  will  sometimes  be  bad  actors.
Nonmanufacturing patent owners will sometimes be bad actors. Manufacturing pat-
ent  owners  will  sometimes  be  bad  actors.  Instead  of  singling  out  bad  actors,  we
should  focus  on  the  bad  acts  and  the  laws  that  make  them  possible.  We  will  solve
the troll problem not by hunting down and eliminating trolls, but by hunting down
and  eliminating  the  many  legal  rules  that  facilitate  the  capture  by  patent  owners
of a disproportionate share of an irreversible investment. We should focus on reform
of current continuation practice, which allows patent owners to hide the true nature
of  their  invention  until  late  in  the  process  and  facilitates  their  later  claiming  to
have  invented  something  they  did  not.64 We  should  focus  on  reform  of  the  willful-
ness  doctrine,  under  which  a  patent  owner  can  get  treble  damages  from  an  inde-
pendent  inventor  merely  by  telling  them  about  the  patent  and  which  has  the  per-
verse  effect  of  causing  people  to  try  to  avoid  learning  of  patents.65 We  should  focus
on reform of royalty calculation rules that give a disproportionate award of damages
to  patent  owners  in  component  industries  because  they  don’t  adequately  take  ac-
count  of  the  contributions  of  other  aspects  of  the  invention.66 And  we  should  take
the  opportunity  presented  by  the  Supreme  Court’s  eBay  decision67 to  craft  intel-
ligent standards for deciding when to grant injunctive relief. If we change the rules
that  make  patent  hold-up  such  an  attractive  revenue  generator,  we  won’t  have  to
worry about the question of whether or not universities—or anyone else—are patent
trolls. We will have eliminated the problem of opportunistic behavior that interferes
with innovation, something we want to stop regardless of what we call it.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MARK A. LEMLEY

Widely  recognized  as  a  preeminent  scholar  of  intellectual  property  law,  Mark
Lemley is a prolific writer, having published over 70 articles and six books, and an
accomplished  litigator,  having  tried  cases  before  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court,  the  Cali-
fornia  Supreme  Court,  and  federal  district  courts.  His  major  contributions  to  legal
scholarship focus on how the economics and technology of the Internet affect patent
law,  copyright  law,  and  trademark  law.  Professor  Lemley  has  testified  numerous
times  before  Congress  and  the  California  legislature  on  patent,  trade  secret,  anti-
trust,  and  constitutional  law  matters  and  currently  serves  as  of  counsel  at  Keker
& Van Nest in their intellectual property and antitrust divisions. Before joining the
Stanford  Law  School  faculty  in  2004,  he  was  a  Professor  of  Law  at  the  University
of California at Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) and at the University of Texas
School of Law, and served as of counsel at Fish & Richardson. He clerked for Judge
Dorothy W. Nelson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Chairman WU. Thank you very much, Dr. Lemley, and I will not
relay  your  comments  to  your  colleagues  at  Stanford.  Dr.  Allen,
please proceed.

63 Indeed,  Jerry  and  Marie  Thursby  argue  that  the  continued  role  of  the  inventor  in  tech-
nology  transfer  is  critical  to  the  success  of  university  licenses.  Jerry  G.  Thursby  &  Marie  C.

to  limit  continuations,  though  whether  the  proposals  will  be  implemented  is  uncertain  at  this
writing. See United States Patent and Trademark Office, Changes to Practice for Continuing Ap-
plications,  Requests

on  my  past  experiences  as  a  researcher  and  transferor  of  tech-
nology,  and  what  this,  perhaps,  has  taught  me.  And  I  think  that
this  experience  also  reflects  upon  some  of  the  questions  the  sub-
committee has asked.

Some years ago, I was sponsored in my Georgia Tech capacity by
the  Department  of  Defense  on  the  topic  of  intelligent  turbine  en-
gines. This was a university interdisciplinary research program ad-
ministered  by  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  my  portion  of  the
project was to develop a pressure sensor that could be used in par-
ticular  locations  in  jet  engines  to  allow  optimal  engine  perform-
ance.  I  worked  with  a  Ph.D.  student,  and  we  designed,  fabricated,
and  tested  a  new  type  of  pressure  sensor  that  was  small.  It  would
operate  in  harsh  environments,  and  able  to  be  communicated  with
in a wireless fashion.

The  results  of  my  research  were  provided  to  the  Department  of
Defense, and are currently being built upon by NASA, and in addi-
tion, the research results were patented by Georgia Tech, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act. Conference publica-
tions,  journal  publications,  and  a  Ph.D.  thesis  were  all  written  on
this work, and were all disseminated as an ongoing part of the aca-
demic  research,  and  the  patenting  did  not  interfere  with  that  in
any way.

I began discussions a few years later with a medical doctor, who
was interested in adapting new technologies to create the next gen-
eration  of  medical  devices,  and  after  several  discussions,  we  noted
that the pressure sensor that we developed for harsh environments
in  engines  might  also  be  applicable  in  another  harsh  environment,
the human body.

We formed a company called CardioMEMS, dedicated to commer-
cialization  of  this  technology.  CardioMEMS  licensed  some  of  the
key patents, including the two cited from this DOD program, exclu-
sively  in  a  specific  field,  that  of  medical  devices.  Based  on  these
patents, CardioMEMS engineers further developed wireless sensors
to  monitor  aneurysms  that  have  been  repaired  by  physicians,  and
the  sensors  are  used  to  provide  information  to  the  physicians,  so
they can monitor whether aneurysm repair is working.

The  government  funding  provided  by  DOD,  that  was  directed  to
the  development  of  the  sensor,  was  approximately  half  a  million
dollars,  and  today,  CardioMEMS  has  received  approximately  $50
million  in  private  equity  investment,  so  that  is  a  ratio  of  about
$100  of  private  investment  for  each  dollar  of  government  invest-
ment. The company currently employs over 100 people. Its sensors
are  FDA  approved,  and  in  fact,  we  are  cited  in  the  2005  FDA  an-

nual  report  as  an  example  of  a  device  ‘‘that  we  believe  will  have
a particular impact on patient care.’’

Having  clear  access  to  the  intellectual  property  developed  in  the
academic laboratory, through the mechanism of the Bayh-Dole Act,
was the prerequisite for CardioMEMS’ success, because as many of
us know, in order to secure venture funding, it is necessary to have
clear intellectual property rights to the inventions being developed.
Speaking  more  generally,  the  benefits  of  Bayh-Dole  are  numer-
ous and well documented. One of the most significant contributions
in  the  Act  may  be  that  it  ensures  nondiscriminatory  access  to  and
benefit  from  the  technologies  that  result  from  our  public  invest-
ment  in  university  research.  This  allows  the  creation  of,  in  the
United  States,  of  new  products,  new  companies,  and  new  markets.
In  2003,  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology  affirmed  the  success  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  and  noted  that
other nations are attempting to replicate this model.

Another  significant  benefit  of  Bayh-Dole,  and  one  that  we  might
think  about  in  our  discussions  of  industry-wide  differentiation,  is
the flexibility of the law. By not constraining the use of Bayh-Dole,
a  variety  of  approaches,  including  exclusive  and  nonexclusive  li-
censing,  exclusive 
fields  of  use,  such  as  the
CardioMEMS  example,  which  did  not  preclude  further  licensing  in
areas  such  as  jet  turbine  engines,  and  also,  the  use  of  territories,
universities  and  companies  are  able  to  tailor  their  agreements  for
specific  industries,  technologies,  and  applications,  under  the  exist-
ing legislation.

Today,  U.S.  industry  continues  to  face  competitive  pressures
globally, and the need for basic research as the foundation of inno-
vation  still  exists.  While  cultural  differences  sometimes  strain  col-
laboration  between  industry  and  academia,  I  firmly  believe  the
Bayh-Dole  Act  has  helped  foster  a  new  and  highly  successful  era
of collaboration, by establishing a uniform federal invention policy,
encouraging  universities  to  develop  relationships  with  industry
through  commercialization  of  inventions,  and  establishing  pref-
erence for manufacturing of products in the United States.

licensing 

in 

Based on the objective numerical successes of the Act, as well as
my own personal experiences with CardioMEMS, I feel strongly we
should  not  alter  in  any  significant  way  the  legislation  that  has
been  so  successful,  and  that  the  rest  of  the  world  is  using  as  a
model of innovation.

In summary, thank you again for the opportunity to comment on
my  experiences,  and  on  the  topic  of  Bayh-Dole,  and  I  would  be
happy to answer any questions.

J.M. Pettit Professorship in Microelectronics. Georgia Tech was founded in 1885 and
is one of the Nation’s top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to
improving  the  human  condition  through  advanced  science  and  technology.  Georgia
Tech’s  campus  occupies  400  acres  in  the  heart  of  the  city  of  Atlanta,  where  more
than 17,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive a focused, technologically-
based  education.  Georgia  Tech  also  has  satellite  campuses  worldwide.  Georgia
Tech’s  vision  and  mission  is  to  define  the  technological  research  university  of  the
21st century, and educate the leaders of a technologically-driven world.

This  hearing  is  focused  on  the  next  25  years  of  technology  transfer  governed  by
the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  In  order  to  comment  on  the  next  quarter  century,  I  will  rely
upon  my  past  experience  as  a  researcher  and  transferor  of  technology.  This  experi-
ence also reflects upon the questions the Subcommittee has asked of me.

In  the  mid  to  late  1990s  and  in  my  capacity  as  a  Georgia  Tech  professor  I  was
involved  with  a  Multi-disciplinary  University  Research  Initiative  (MURI)  program
on  Intelligent  Turbine  Engines.  As  defined  by  the  Department  of  Defense,  ‘‘The
MURI program is a multi-agency DOD program that supports research teams whose
efforts intersect more than one traditional science and engineering discipline. Multi-
disciplinary team effort can accelerate research progress in areas particularly suited
to this approach by cross-fertilization of ideas, can hasten the transition of basic re-
search  findings  to  practical  applications,  and  can  help  to  train  students  in  science
and/or engineering in areas of importance to DOD.’’ 2

The  particular  program  was  sponsored  by  the  Army  Research  Office  and  was  on
the  topic  of  ‘‘Intelligent  Turbine  Engines.’’  My  portion  of  the  project  was  to  develop
a pressure sensor that could be used in particular locations in the engine to provide
control  signals  to  ensure  optimal  engine  performance.  Working  with  a  Ph.D.  stu-
dent,  we  designed,  fabricated,  and  tested  a  new  type  of  pressure  sensor  that  was
(1) small in size; (2) capable of operating in harsh environments, such as high tem-
perature; and (3) capable of wireless interrogation.

The  results  of  my  research  were  provided  to  the  Army.  In  addition,  the  research
results  were  patented  by  Georgia  Tech3 in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the
Bayh-Dole  Act.  Conference  publications4,  journal  publications5,  and  a  Ph.D.  thesis6
were written and disseminated as an ongoing part of this academic research.

In  the  2000–2001  timeframe,  I  began  discussions  with  a  medical  doctor  who  was
interested  in  exploiting  microelectromechanical  systems  (MEMS)-based  manufac-
turing technologies to create a new generation of medical devices. Wireless sensors,
that could sense disease states from within the body, were a particular interest area
of both of us; from his perspective as a clinician and from mine as an engineer. After
several discussions, we noted that the turbine engine sensor developed for harsh en-
vironments  under  the  MURI  research  program  might  also  be  applicable  in  another
harsh  environment,  the  human  body.  We  formed  a  company,  Cardiomems7,  dedi-
cated to the commercialization of this technology. Cardiomems licensed key patents,
including  the  two  cited  from  the  MURI  project,  exclusively  in  the  field  of  medical
devices.  Based  on  these  patents,  Cardiomems  engineers  developed  wireless  sensors
as monitors of endovascularly-repaired abdominal aortic aneurysms. The sensors are
integrated  with  an  external  measurement  antenna.  A  real-time  waveform  of  the
pressure  environment  of  the  excluded  aneurysm  is  extracted  and  provided  to  the
physician to diagnose the state of the aneurysm repair.

The government funding provided by the Army Research Office that was directed
to the development of this sensor was approximately $500,000. To date, Cardiomems
has  received  approximately  $50  million  in  private  equity  investment,  a  ratio  of  ap-
proximately  $100  of  private  investment  for  each  $1  of  government  investment.
Cardiomems currently employs over 100 people. Its wireless pressure sensors for an-
eurysm sensing were cleared for sale in the United States by the FDA in late 2005
and to date thousands of people have received them.

One  of  the  key  due  diligence  reviews  prior  to  any  private  equity  investment  is  a
thorough  review  of  the  intellectual  property  licensed  by  the  company,  and  it  was
clearly  stated  by  investors  that  a  strong  intellectual  property  position  would  be  a

prerequisite  for  any  investment.  Without  this  strong  position,  enabled  by  licensing
the critical technologies from Georgia Tech, in my opinion it would have been impos-
sible  for  the  company  to  have  raised  funding  for  this  product.  Due  in  part  to  the
strong IP position the company holds as enabled by the Bayh-Dole Act, the medical
community  now  has  available  a  commercial  device  that  has  helped  thousands  of
people,  won  multiple  awards,  and  was  cited  in  the  2005  annual  report  of  the  Food
and Drug Administration as a device ‘‘that we believe will have a particular impact
on patient care.’’ 8

To  summarize  this  portion  of  my  testimony,  what  these  experiences  have  taught
me  is  that  the  commercialization  process  has  many  challenges.  By  far  the  largest
challenge  is  the  development  effort  required  to  transform  academic  discoveries  into
useful,  commercial,  salable  products  (as  I  mentioned  above,  this  effort  at  least  for
Cardiomems was in dollar terms approximately a 100:1 ratio), and includes not only
further  technical  development,  but  also  legal  issues,  raising  funds,  liability  protec-
tion,  and  securing  regulatory  approval.  However,  before  embarking  on  any  of  these
additional  challenges,  and  before  raising  the  first  dollar  from  private  investments,
Cardiomems  negotiated  for  licenses  to  the  intellectual  property  with  the  university
holders.  Having  clear  access  to  the  intellectual  property  developed  in  the  academic
laboratory  through  the  mechanisms  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  was  the  prerequisite  for
Cardiomems’ success.

Although I have spoken previously from my viewpoint as an academic researcher
and given a single example of Bayh-Dole-enabled success, it is clear that the Bayh-
Dole Act has had a broad and profound effect on academic technology transfer more
generally.  In  the  first  twenty-five  years  after  its  passage,  there  was  a  ten-fold  in-
crease  in  academic  patent  portfolios  according  to  statistics  maintained  by  the  Asso-
ciation of University Technology Managers. If, as some have said, innovation is the
intersection of invention and opportunity, this wave of innovation created 5,000 new
businesses,  3,641  new  products,  and  generated  300,000  jobs.9 Annually,  U.S.  re-
search  universities  and  institutions  receive  about  sixty-seven  percent  of  their  re-
search funding from the Federal Government).10 Inevitably, simply because the vast
majority of inventions in universities arise in the course of federally-funded projects,
universities’ obligations under Bayh-Dole will shape administrative systems for han-
dling intellectual property, irrespective of the funding source.

In  the  State  of  Georgia  the  economic  impact  of  technology  transfer  activities  at
universities  is  profound.  Georgia  Tech  ranked  9th  on  the  U.S.  Patent  and  Trade-
mark Office’s List of Top 10 Universities Receiving the Most Patents in 2005 (April
6, 2006). In announcing the list, Jon Dudas, Under Secretary of Commerce for Intel-
lectual  Property  noted  that  ‘‘America’s  economic  strength  and  global  leadership  de-
pend  on  continued  technological  advances.  Ground-breaking  discoveries  and  pat-
ented  inventions  generated  by  innovative  minds  at  academic  institutions  have  paid
enormous  dividends,  improving  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  generations  of  Ameri-
cans.’’ That certainly seems to be the case in Georgia. In our most recent fiscal year,
Georgia  Tech  executed  42  licenses  and  options,  most  for  more  than  one  patent.  In
fiscal  year  2006,  ten  new  companies  were  formed  based  Georgia  Tech  technologies;
between  2001  and  2006,  that  list  includes  53  companies.  Since  1999,  companies
from the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC)11, a business incubator
that is part of Georgia Tech’s Enterprise Innovation Institute, have raised over one
billion  dollars  in  venture  capital.  In  2006,  10  of  the  top  25  largest  venture  capital
deals in Georgia—including the two largest—went to ATDC companies, representing
21 percent of investments in Georgia.

The  most  significant  contribution  of  the  Act  may  be  that  it  ensures  non-discrimi-
natory access to and benefit from the technologies that result from the public invest-
ment  in  university  research.  Small  businesses  receive  preference  under  Bayh-Dole
but  the  marketplace  establishes  the  consideration  for  the  license.  As  a  condition  of
federal awards, universities are obligated to take steps to make nascent technologies
available  to  the  public  by  licensing  them  to  entities  that  have  the  ability  to  bring
them  to  the  marketplace.  Universities  must  ensure  that  licensees  meet  milestones
for  development  of  the  technologies  or  products.  Universities  provide  the  govern-
ment  with  a  royalty-free  right  to  use  the  technology  for  government  purposes.  Fi-
nally,  in  the  relatively  rare  event  that  the  university  receives  royalties  under  a  li-
cense, its share of the funds may only be used to further research and the education
of students. This reinvestment in research and education benefits both industry and

the public through building research capacity in the public space and expanding the
high tech workforce.

The  impact  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  varies  across  industry  sectors.  Biotechnology,
medical device, and pharmaceutical companies typically must have the ability to ob-
tain  exclusive  licenses  to  intellectual  property.  In  this  sector,  new  products  tend  to
have  fewer  components.  They  also  must  meet  expensive,  time-consuming,  but  nec-
essary regulatory requirements to bring a product to market. By comparison, in the
electronics sector, where the long-term value of specific intellectual property is vari-
able,  access  to  a  wide  portfolio  of  patents  may  be  necessary  to  develop  a  product.
Product  realization  tends  to  be  more  rapid.  Similarly,  different  licensing  strategies
may apply in dealing with small companies, in particular start-ups, than with larger
companies.  And,  in  a  number  of  circumstances,  the  competitive  advantage  afforded
through  exclusivity  may  be  absolutely  critical  to  justify  the  risk  undertaken  by  a
company  in  developing  a  product  from  a  promising  early-stage  university  tech-
nology, as it was in the case of Cardiomems. As technology transfer within U.S. uni-
versities has matured over the past twenty-five years, this need for different licens-
ing strategies across and within industry sectors has become widely recognized. For-
tunately, the authors of the Act anticipated this need and provided universities with
the flexibility to pursue exclusive or non-exclusive licensing strategies.

Challenges  do  exist  in  the  relationship  between  American  companies  and  univer-
sities.  The  primary  cultural  differences  between  them  stem  from  their  divergent
missions and result from differences in their research agendas and positions on the
dissemination  of  knowledge.  In  2004,  the  National  Academies  of  Sciences’  Govern-
ment  University  Industry  Research  Roundtable  served  as  the  neutral  convener  for
a collaborative effort of the National Council of University Research Administrators
and  the  Industrial  Research  Institute  that  would  lead  to  an  open  dialogue  about
these cultural differences. It was hoped that the conversation would lead to new ap-
proaches  that  could  respect  the  missions  of  higher  education  and  private  industry
and their respective contributions to innovation. In April 2006, this group published
Guiding Principles for University-Industry Endeavors12 which examines the perspec-
tives of universities and industries and identifies the common ground and the sym-
biotic  relationship  between  American  companies  and  universities.  These  Guiding
Principles can serve as a roadmap for building collaboration and have the potential
to  foster  stronger  ties  among  those  with  common  interests.  However,  an  examina-
tion of this document reveals that the treatment of inventions that arise from feder-
ally-funded  research  at  universities  is  not  a  factor  in  the  relationship  between  in-
dustry and universities.

The Subcommittee asks about the possible effects of the globalization of research.
Universities  in  the  United  States  have  traditionally  welcomed  students  from
around the world. Faculty members have for many decades engaged in open collabo-
rations  in  research  and  educational  programs  with  colleagues  in  other  countries.
Universities  have,  therefore,  had  long  experience  in  competing  globally  for  talented
students  and  faculty  and  competing  globally  in  scholarship  and  intellectual  output.
For  the  last  half  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  United  States  was  undoubtedly  the
world’s  leader  in  science  and  technology.  Even  as  European  universities  rebuilt  fol-
lowing  World  War  II,  other  nations’  research  institutions  have  emerged  and  grown
along with R&D investment in those countries. Scientific and technological research
as  a  global  phenomenon  has  been  studied  intensively  in  recent  years  by  a  number
of  organizations  including  the  National  Academies  of  Sciences,  The  President’s
Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology  (PCAST),  and  the  National  Science
Board.

The  Committee  on  Science,  Engineering  and  Public  Policy  of  the  National  Acad-
emies  stated  in  200613,  ‘‘Many  international  comparisons  put  the  United  States  as
a  leader  in  applying  research  and  innovation  to  improve  economic  performance’’.
However,  both  this  report  and  the  PCAST  report,  Sustaining  the  Nation’s  Innova-
tion  Ecosystems:  A  Report  on  Information  Technology  Manufacturing  and  Competi-
tiveness14,  noted  that  other  nations  are  catching  up  to  U.S.  leadership  in  informa-
tion technology research and development. In its Science and Engineering Indicators
200615,  the  National  Science  Board  characterized  the  link  between  innovation  and
economic competitiveness by asserting that,

Increasingly,  the  international  competitiveness  of  a  modern  economy  is  defined
by  its  ability  to  generate,  absorb,  and  commercialize  knowledge.  Although  it  is
no  panacea,  scientific  and  technological  knowledge  has  proven  valuable  in  ad-
dressing  the  challenges  countries  face  in  a  variety  of  areas  such  as  sustainable
development, economic growth, health care, and agricultural production. Nations
benefit  from  R&D  performed  abroad,  but  domestic  R&D  performance  is  an  im-
portant  indicator  of  a  nation’s  innovative  capacity  and  its  prospects  for  future
growth, productivity, and S&T competitiveness.

This report also found that the majority of research and development in the world
is  still  performed  by  a  small  number  of  wealthy  nations  but  that,  as  in  many  sec-
tors,  emerging  economies  are  investing  increased  resources  in  research.  The  Na-
tional  Science  Board  identified  the  following  factors  in  assessing  a  country’s  R&D
performance and innovation capabilities:

engineers

• The culture of cooperation between R&D performing sectors
• The  ability  of  a  country  to  train  and  retain  its  highly  skilled  scientists  and
• Strong intellectual property laws and a strong patent system
• Governmental, legal, and cultural restrictions
• The presence of a sophisticated, demanding, and wealthy domestic market for
• The quality of research institutions (universities and government facilities) as
quantitatively  assessed  by  objective  measures  of  research  output  and  peer
rankings

innovation

• Research infrastructure including facilities and instrumentation.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  a  key  element  in  several  of  these  factors.  The  Act  is  part
of  strong  protections  for  intellectual  property  that  arises  from  federally-funded  re-
search and helps ensure that entrepreneurs can find the sophisticated, wealthy, de-
manding  investors  and,  ultimately,  markets  for  new  technologies.  Bayh-Dole  also
contributes  to  the  strength  and  quality  of  U.S.  research  universities.  In  2003,
PCAST affirmed the success of the Bayh-Dole Act and noted that other nations are
attempting  to  replicate  this  model.  As  Senator  Birch  Bayh  commented  in  a  speech
last year to the Licensing Executives Society, ‘‘It is no accident the rest of the world
is  copying  the  Bayh-Dole  model.  The  European  Union,  Japan,  China,  India  and
many  others  hope  to  tap  their  own  cutting  edge  university  research  to  win  the  fu-
ture  economic  race.  We  in  the  United  States  cannot  afford  to  rest  on  our  laurels.’’
For  example,  Japan,  clearly  recognized  as  a  world  economic  leader  with  a  focus  on
technology  markets,  began  implementing  laws  in  the  1990’s  that  contained  provi-
sions  similar  to  the  U.S.  Bayh-Dole  Act.  Other  countries  throughout  the  world  now
recognize the importance of protecting intellectual property, having laws that allow
their  universities  to  assert  rights  in  employee  created  intellectual  property,  and  of
benchmarking  the  system  that  resulted  from  the  passage  of  Bayh-Dole.  As  Senator
Bayh  further  noted,  ‘‘When  India  decided  that  it  wanted  to  start  being  a  creator  of
technology and not an exporter of scientists to the West, it began protecting intellec-
tual property.’’

Finally,  the  Subcommittee  has  asked  what  changes  might  be  appropriate  as  we

look forward to the next 25 years of Bayh-Dole.

The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology undertook a year-
long  study  of  the  results  of  the  federal  investment  in  research  and  development.
Their  Report  on  Technology  Transfer  of  Federally  Funded  R&D:  Findings  and  Pro-
posed  Actions16 was  submitted  to  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  on
May 13, 2003. I commend this report, which offers a thorough analysis of technology
transfer  by  a  panel  representing  both  higher  education  and  industry,  to  the  Sub-
committee  and  have  included  it  as  an  appendix  to  this  written  testimony.  While
PCAST  made  a  number  of  recommendations  to  the  Department  of  Commerce  and
others regarding education and implementation, their conclusion is:

‘‘Existing technology transfer legislation works and should not be altered.’’

By almost any objective standard, the Bayh-Dole Act has been an exceptional suc-
cess. More compelling than the 4,932 new licenses signed, the 527 new products in-
troduced into the market or the 628 new companies formed in 2005 according to the
AUTM’s U.S. Licensing Survey are the individual technology realization stories cap-
tured  in  their  The  Better  World  Report  first  published  last  year.  This  report  takes

an in-depth look at twenty-five innovations derived from academic research that has
had a dramatic impact on the world. Whether it is the story of Taxol® and the more
than  two  million  women  worldwide  who  have  taken  the  drug  to  fight  ovarian  and
breast cancer, the SpeechEasy®  device that has helped thousands of individuals af-
fected  with  stuttering,  GoogleΤΜ and  its  more  than  10,000  employees,  or  countless
others, including the Cardiomems story, the success of academic technology realiza-
tion  is  clear.  This  is  a  significant  improvement  from  when  intellectual  property  re-
sulting from federally funded research was available to all non-exclusively and near-
ly 30,000 patents laid dormant.

Over twenty-five years ago, Senator Birch Bayh opened the hearings on the legis-

lation with the following statement:

‘‘The  United  States  has  built  its  prosperity  on  innovation.  That  tradition  of  un-
surpassed innovation remains our heritage, but without continued effort it is not
necessarily  our  destiny.  There  is  no  engraving  in  stone  from  on  high  that  we
shall remain No. 1 in international economic competition. In a number of indus-
tries  we  are  no  longer  even  No.  2.  New  incentives  and  policies  are  needed  to  re-
verse this trend.’’

Today,  U.S.  industry  continues  to  face  competitive  pressures  globally.  The  need
for  basic  research  as  the  foundation  of  innovation  still  exists.  And,  while,  cultural
differences  sometimes  strain  collaboration  between  industry  and  academia,  the
Bayh-Dole  Act  has  helped  foster  a  new  and  highly  successful  era  of  collaboration
by  establishing  a  uniform  federal  invention  policy,  encouraging  universities  to  de-
velop  relationships  with  industry  through  commercialization  of  inventions,  and  es-
tablishing preference for manufacturing of products in the United States.

Based on the objective, numerical successes of the Act as well as my personal ex-
periences  with  Cardiomems,  I  feel  strongly  we  should  not  alter  in  any  significant
way  the  legislation  that  has  been  so  successful,  and  that  the  rest  of  the  world  is
using as the model of innovation.

Thank you again for this opportunity to comment on my experiences and the topic
of Bayh-Dole. I am pleased to respond to any requests the Subcommittee may have
for additional information regarding my testimony.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  WU.  I  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for  your  very  illu-
minating  testimony,  and  now,  we  will  turn  to  questions.  And  at
this  point,  we  will  open  for  our  first  round  of  questions,  and  the
Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.

Mr.  Pradhan,  you  believe  that  Bayh-Dole  has  stimulated  tech-
nology transfer, and also, done a reasonable job of encouraging pro-
ductive university-industry partnerships. It appears from our panel
of  witnesses  that  this  view  is  not  universally  shared,  and  I  would
like  to  give  you  and  the  other  witnesses  an  opportunity  to  discuss
this  issue  in  this  forum,  and  then,  to  drill  down,  and  get  a  little
bit  more  granularity  on  that  discussion,  about  where  the  problems
exist,  and  where  they  do  not,  whether  it  applies  uniformly  across
different fields.

And  Mr.  Pradhan,  let  me  turn  it  over  to  you,  and  then,  we  will

do this first four minutes in a discussion format.

Mr.  PRADHAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  I  do  believe  that  there
are  more  collaborations,  effective  collaborations  that  are  occurring
between universities and industry at this juncture than there have
been  before.  My  personal  experiences  in  this  have  been  very  posi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

95

tive. At every institution that I have been at, the amount of indus-
try collaborations has progressively increased.

I  have  been  at  Oregon  Health  and  Science  University  for  three
years, and even in the three years that I have been there, the num-
ber of collaborations has doubled, and the amount of research fund-
ing  changing  hands  has  tripled.  And  this  is  across  all  sectors.  We
have  effectively  partnered  with  companies  in  the  IT  industry.  We
continue  to  effectively  partner  with  companies  for  drug  develop-
ment, for clinical trials, and for basic research.

I  think  one  of  the  fundamental  aspects  that  one  has  to  keep  in
mind  are  the  different  cultures  that  each  industry  brings  to  the
table,  and  the  culture  of  collaboration  at  a  university.  Intellectual
property  itself  is  not  a  stumbling  block,  in  my  opinion.  Access  to
intellectual  property  is  determined  by  the  nature  of  the  project.  It
is determined by what outcomes are being sought, and it is also de-
termined  by  what  relative  contributions  are  made  prior  to  the  re-
search  project  actually  coming  together  between  a  company  and  a
university.

So,  I  think  the  fundamental  aspect  of  being  pragmatic,  and  ap-
proaching  this  in  a  collaborative  way,  tends  to  alleviate  a  number
of  the  problems  that  we  have  heard.  It  is  true  that  you  can’t  rely
on  patents  in  the  IT  industry  to  generate  royalties.  In  fact,  if  you
take  a  look  at  a  printer  or  at  a  computer,  there  is  upwards  of  500
patented  technologies  that  go  into  that.  The  price  pressure  for
those in the marketplace is to keep the prices down, and——

Chairman  WU.  Arun,  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  summarize  your
comments.  I  will  extend  the  same  courtesy  to  other  members  who
are here. We will permit panelists to finish comments on the same
question  asked,  but  I  am  going  to  run  over  my  first  five  minutes,
but  the  prerogative  of  the  chair,  we  will  stay  here  as  long  as  we
need to to run through all of my questions in cycle.

Mr. PRADHAN. I will be brief. In summation, I think the problem

are not insurmountable.

Chairman  WU.  Dr.  Butts  and  Mr.  Johnson,  your  comments,  per-
haps, and then, perhaps Dr. Lemley, you would like to clean up on
this, and Dr. Allen, I don’t mean to exclude you, if you have some-
thing you need after that also, please.

Dr.  BUTTS.  Yes,  just  a  couple  of  thoughts  to  share.  The  growth
in  the  number  of  partnerships  is  really  a  general  phenomenon.  In
fact,  as  companies  have  moved  from  the  old  model  of  having  the
big,  central  research  organization,  to  recognizing  that  it  is  more
productive  to  use  external  resources,  I  think  in  general,  the  num-
ber  of  collaborations  happening  is  increasing.  So,  not  just  between
companies in the U.S. and U.S. universities, but around the world,
in other sorts of collaborations. So, I don’t think that is necessarily
the best metric for the state of the relationship.

But  I  would  also  say  that  in  negotiations,  my  experience  has
been  that  universities  and  companies  are  both  trying  to  do  the
right  thing  for  their  institutions,  and  so,  what  they  are  trying  to
do  is  live  by  their  expectations,  or  in  some  cases,  of  the  univer-
sities’ patent policies, that dictate how intellectual property should
be handled.

And where we see the difficulty, often, is in the timeline. So, the
difference  in  the  university  mission  and  the  sense  of  time,  versus

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

96

a corporate mission, and the sense of time. So, for instance, within
Dow, our projects are all on a project timeline, with milestones and
decision  points,  and  when  we  spend  five  months  negotiating  an
agreement, it may be that the research project, when it finally gets
started,  delivers  its  results  too  late  to  be  useful.  So,  to  me,  it  is  a
very important issue around how long it takes to reach agreement,
even if we eventually get there.

Chairman WU. Thank you. Mr. Johnson, your comments.
Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  have  three  of  them.  Well,  one  of  the  things  that
is, I think, apparent so far is that the IT industry is really different
than  some  of  the  others  that  we  have  been  talking  about.  In  fact,
you  know,  if  you  look  at  what  we  do  as  a  practice,  we  actually
cross-license even our own inventions to our competitors, otherwise,
we don’t have a product. So, I think in any kind of situation where
you  are  dealing  with  a  certain  vertical  industry,  the  universities,
I  think,  need  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  that  is,  you  know,
our  expectation.  Our  time  to  market  is  three  to  six  months.  Our
cost per unit keeps doing down, so to be competitive, we really need
to do that.

I  would  also  say  that  there  is  a  difference  between  universities.
I  mean,  I  manage  the  entire  strategic  university  portfolio  across
Hewlett-Packard, so I have an insight into a broad range of univer-
sities  here  and  overseas.  I  think  it  differs  between  universities
even  in  the  U.S.  We  have  universities  where  we  are  more  able  to
negotiate  these  patents  more  quickly,  or  licenses,  and  ones  that
don’t.  So,  I  think  to  some  degree,  it  is  a  function  of  the  leadership
and the strategic thinking of the university.

I would also comment that I don’t think industry is blameless in
this.  There  are  some  companies  that  haven’t  developed  the  right
strategy,  and  don’t  understand  the  difference  in  cultures.  If  you
don’t figure out what the cultural differences are, you are not going
to  have  a  very  good  relationship,  and  you  are  not  going  to  work
quickly to get something done.

And  I  would  say,  from  an  IT  industry  perspective,  the  fact  that
we  are  a  global,  clearly  a  global  activity,  we  need  to  go  places
where the technology, the localization, so we are constantly looking
for  opportunities  to  go  somewhere  else  that  we  can  get  the  work
done as quickly as possible.

From a U.S. perspective, I don’t think this is necessarily bad, but
if  we  end  up  going  only  outside  the  U.S.,  it  would  clearly  be.  So,
I  think  the  issue  of  the  global  industries,  and  Dow,  I  think,  is  an-
other example, we go where the information is, where the talented
people are, and the ability to get the work done more rapidly.

So,  I  think  all  of  those  are  factors  that  makes  the  IT  industry

somewhat different.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  for  your  comments,  Mr.  Johnson,  and
I  think  that  something  that  you  said  triggered  in  my  mind  that
perhaps  one  of  the  ignored  factors  in  competitiveness  for  the  long
term  is  our  visa  policy,  and  we  will  hold  hearings  in  the  Science
Committee on that issue later.

Dr. Lemley or Dr. Allen, any comments on this, and then, we will

turn it to Dr. Gingrey.

Dr.  LEMLEY.  Well,  so,  I  think  that  the  most  successful  examples
of  university-private  collaboration  have  been  in  what  Mr.  Johnson

called  the  home  run  patents,  the  very  successful  new  inventions
that  can  then  form  the  basis  of  a  product  that  is  sold  in  the  mar-
ketplace.  Those  are  the  ones  where  the  patent  needs  to  be  turned
into  a  product  that  is  commercialized.  They  tend  to  be  in  the  bio-
medical space, though there are exceptions to that.

And the problem comes about when universities take that lucra-
tive  licensing  model  for  home  run  patents,  and  they  try  to  apply
it  to  the  patent  that  is  one  component  out  of  500  in  a  product.
There,  not  only  are  you  having  to  deal  with  the  other  patents,  but
you have also got the problem, you have less need for this commer-
cialization.  You  are  not  building  a  product  around  this  patent.  It
is one piece in a much larger puzzle.

Dr.  ALLEN.  So,  one  thing  that  I  heard  from  all  of  our  panelists
was that perhaps it is not so much changes in the Bayh-Dole legis-
lation itself that is important, as it is education of some of the uni-
versities and technology transfer offices to these differences.

And  we  do  have,  within  the  current  legislation,  this  flexibility
available to us to do both kinds, the home run kind of licensing and
the  nonexclusive  licensing  to  all  comers.  I,  personally,  as  a  re-
searcher,  have  been  involved  in  both,  where  appropriate,  and  I
think that would be a good model, perhaps, for us to consider.

Chairman WU. We will return to this topic, but my time has ex-

pired long ago. Dr. Gingrey.

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you. And it really is a segue
into my question, and I am going to address it first to Dr. Lemley,
because he commented on it first.

You  were  talking  in  your  testimony,  Dr.  Lemley,  and  you  men-
tioned  biotech  and  pharmaceutical  companies  benefit  from  patents
due  to  the  high  R&D  costs,  and  the  lengthy  process  of  commer-
cialization.  And  I  want  to  know,  and  we  will  start  with  you,  and
then,  the  other  witnesses  may  comment,  are  you  suggesting  that
Congress  might  consider  creating  product-specific  or  industry-spe-
cific  patent  regulations  that  are  different?  And  we  will  start  with
you, Doctor.

Dr.  LEMLEY.  I  think  that  is  a  possibility,  though  I  would  look  at
it as a last resort, in part, because it is very difficult to draw lines
that  cleanly  divide  technologies,  so  there  are  all  sorts  of  examples.
One  that  comes  to  mind  immediately  is  bioinformatics,  which  is
this  interesting  crossover  of  biotechnology  and  computer  software
in  the  service  of  trying  to  kind  of  mine  and  rationalize  bio-
technology data.

I  do  think  it  is  a  problem.  I  think  it  is  a  problem,  the  industry
specificity,  that  we  ought  to  try  to  solve  at  the  university  level.  It
is  something  that  we  could  solve  at  the  government  level,  if  need
be,  though  my  preference  would  be,  rather  than  industry-specific
rules  and  legislation,  having  the  PTO  or  some  other  agency  with
enough  authority  to  make  a  case  by  case  decision,  that  here  is  a
circumstance  in  which  we  want  to  march  in  and  require  nonexclu-
sive licensing.

Mr. GINGREY. I think, maybe Dr. Allen, you had mentioned some-
thing  in  your  last  comment,  if  you  would  like  to  pick  up  on  what
Dr. Lemley just said.

Dr. ALLEN. That is right, and I do agree that different industries,
as  I  mentioned,  do  need  different  treatments,  so  to  speak,  but  I

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

98

really  don’t  believe  that  treatment  at  the  level  of  legislation  is  re-
quired. I think it is more, perhaps, in the regulation and implemen-
tation or interpretation of the legislation where that might be most
useful.

Otherwise, we will wind up with situations where companies are
struggling to define their products in one area or another, in order
to  receive  favorable  treatment,  perhaps,  under  certain  differen-
tiating patent rules or what have you.

Mr. GINGREY. Dr. Pradhan, and then, we will go to Dr. Butts and

Mr. Johnson.

Mr.  PRADHAN.  I  agree  with  Drs.  Lemley  and  Allen.  It  is  very
hard to legislate patent policy by industry sector. In fact, the exam-
ple  that  Dr.  Allen  used,  where  the  original  invention  occurred  for
smart  turbine  engines  is  now  being  applied  in  healthcare,  is  very
illustrative  of  how  widely  some  university  inventions  can  be  ap-
plied,  and  from  the  university  perspective,  we  actually  cross  a  lot
of industry sectors with any particular invention.

Dr.  BUTTS.  I  am  concerned  that  a  legislative  remedy  that  in-
volved  defining  industries  or  technologies  would  only  complicate
the situation, and I would prefer to see more flexibility, so that in-
dividual companies and universities felt that they were freer to ne-
gotiate  and  agreement  that  made  sense  for  the  particular  cir-
cumstances of the project.

Mr. JOHNSON. I would agree also with Susan’s point on trying to
figure out what industry specifically to add up and put in a certain
column.  I  would,  however,  say  that  our  typical  interaction  with  a
university,  where  we  walk  in  to  try  to  sponsor  research,  we  are
looking  to  find  some  of  the  best  people  in  the  world  which  are
there.  They  have  already  done  the  research,  that  is  why  we  know
that  they  are  there.  We  come  in,  we  say  we  want  to  sponsor  you
with,  say,  $100,000,  and  the  first  comment  out  of  the  other  side  is
well,  it  has  got  to  be  an  exclusive  license,  and  we  own  all  the
rights.

This  idea  that  our  major  negotiating  position  is  to  have  a  non-
exclusive,  royalty-free  license,  especially  when  we  are  funding  the
research,  we  think  that  is  reasonable.  That  is  a  win-win.  So,  even
though Bayh-Dole provides for the possibility of both, I will tell you
that  the  conversation,  90  percent  of  the  time,  does  not  go  there.
And  that  is  what  often  takes  the  six  months,  nine  months,  a  year,
year and a half, 18 months, for us to get done. So, even though the
flexibility is there, that isn’t where the negotiation starts.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Dr. Gingrey. Let me follow up on that

before I turn to a related topic.

Mr.  Johnson,  you  said  that  when  you  come  in  with  potentially
$100,000  on  the  table  for  sponsored  research,  frequently  the  goal
is  to  have  a  nonexclusive,  royalty-free  license  from  any  resulting
technology. I would like to hear from you, and perhaps some of the
other  folks  who  are  familiar  with  university  policy,  what  prevents
that  particular  deal  from  working  quickly,  when  there  are  poten-
tially  other  revenue  opportunities  from  that  particular  sponsored
research?

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  think  it  starts  out  from  the  premise  that  the
blockbuster  patent  or  the  pharmaceutical  way  of  doing  business  is
the  best  way  to  do  business.  I  think  there  is  an  expectation  there

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

99

will be more outcome or wealth for the university if that is the ap-
proach  that  is  taken.  I  also  think,  based  on  our  experience,  that
when we negotiate these things, it often ends up with an individual
researcher, or an HP attorney, and the technology transfer office in
the university, that no one has thought about the broader implica-
tions,  both  strategic  and  business,  that  need  to  be  thought  about
as we are discussing this. So, our remedy, that we have worked on
in California, which has actually moved in the right direction, is to
move  the  whole  conversation  upstream,  to  understand  why  is  a
company coming to this university. Yes, it is about the technology,
but typically, it is about a long-term strategic partnership.

At the Provost level, this conversation goes great. At the legal or
lawyer  level,  it  goes  downhill  quickly,  and  so,  our  remedy  for  that
is  really  to  get  people  engaged  at  a  much  higher  level  in  under-
standing  why  the  two  organizations  are  coming  together.  That  is
often much more effective, and is the only effective way to get this
to  happen  more  quickly,  so  it  is  almost  a  conditioned  response.
Here is some money, oh, I want an exclusive license. You don’t get
the nonexclusive, royalty-free license, which is effectively what the
IT  industry  does  among  itself.  This  isn’t  something  new.  This  is
how  we  build  our  industry.  IBM,  HP,  Microsoft,  we  all  cross-li-
cense.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Johnson,  and  we  will
let  other  folks  comment  on  this,  if  folks  have  a  comment,  in  one
moment.  Mr.  Johnson,  and  this  is  related  to  the  question  of  what
works  and  what  doesn’t.  In  your  written  testimony,  you  list  Pur-
due,  Georgia  Tech,  University  of  California,  and  Stanford  as  insti-
tutions  that  perhaps  do  a  better  job  of  striking  a  balance  to  pro-
mote  technology  transfer.  What  is  different  in  the  practices  among
what you would characterize as successful institutions, versus some
others  that  you  negotiate  with?  And  Dr.  Allen,  you  referred  to,  we
don’t  need  legislation,  we  need  better  behavior,  so  let  us  circle  in
on  what  that,  what  the  behavior  is,  and  what  the  mechanisms
might be for any potential improvements.

Mr.  JOHNSON.  So,  I  would  say,  generally  speaking,  that  the  li-
censing  offices  at  those  universities  are  staffed  with  some  of  the
best  people  that  we  know  in  the  university  community.  They  are
able to, there is a philosophy of staffing at that level, meaning very
high  level  kind  of  capability.  I  would  also  say  that  as  I  mentioned
before,  that  there  is  an  understanding  of  the  strategic  partnership
in  all  of  those  universities,  all  the  way  up  to  the  President  level,
of  what  combining  with  HP  means  from  their  perspective.  I  would
also  say  that  we  have  been  engaged  in  that  process  in  all  of  those
universities  for  maybe  10  or  15  years,  so  long-term  strategic  part-
nerships have been developed.

And  in  the  case  of  Berkeley,  recently,  we  have  worked  on  this
very long activity of looking at what are the strategic reasons that
we are engaged with Berkeley, and then, we filter that all the way
down  into  the  licensing  office.  So,  again,  it  is  not  a  one  decision,
one  license  negotiation.  It  is  done  at  a  very  high  strategic  level.
And  it  seems  that  all  of  those  universities  more  or  less  operate
under those circumstances.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you.  Arun,  I  believe  you  had  some  com-

ment on this, or the prior exchange.

100

Mr. PRADHAN. This, as well as the prior exchange. I tend to agree
with  Mr.  Johnson,  with  respect  to  establishing  strategic  alliances
between  universities  and  industry.  However,  taking  the  IT  model
and  drilling  down  a  little  further,  as  you  suggested,  most  univer-
sities  would  be  willing  to  grant  nonexclusive  licenses,  but  often-
times,  where  the  communication  breakdown  occurs  is  that  even  in
the  cross-licensing  realm,  for  example,  universities  need  to  be  able
to  license  other  practitioners  in  the  IT  industry,  if  they  are  to  de-
rive revenue.

And so, there is an issue with respect to sublicensing rights that
often  comes  up.  A  nonexclusive,  irrevocable,  royalty-free  license
that  is  sublicensable  does  nothing  for  an  academic  institution  at
that  point.  And  it  is  hard  to  comment  on  the  aspects  of  any  one
particular  negotiation,  but  these  are  just  some  of  the  principles
that  we  try  to  keep  in  mind  as  we  move  forward.  Where  if  we  un-
derstand  what  the  needs  are,  and  the  company  understands  what
the  institution  needs  are,  then  we  can  often  arrive  at  an  amicable
resolution.

Chairman  WU.  I  want  to  let  the  other  three  witnesses  comment
on  this  particular  exchange,  and  for  the  next  five  minutes  that  I
have,  Dr.  Allen,  you  mentioned  that  statutory  approaches  may  not
be  appropriate,  but  that  perhaps  a  regulatory  approach  or  some-
thing  more  flexible  might  work.  What  I  have  been  racking  my
brain  about  since  you  made  that  comment  is  that  we  do  not  have
an  SEC,  we  do  not  have  an  FDA.  We  might  not  want  to  have  any
of those things in this particular arena, but I will save that for the
next round of questions.

Do any of the other witnesses have comments on what Mr. John-

son and Mr. Pradhan have commented on?

Dr.  BUTTS.  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  options  that  are  on
the table in licensing, and actually, contrary to Wayne’s experience,
typically,  when  we  are  working  with  a  university,  what  they  are
comfortable  offering  us  is  an  option  to  negotiate  a  license  to  fore-
ground  inventions,  with  no  certainty  that  we  will  be  able  to  come
to  terms  or  no,  really,  indication  of  what  we  might  have  to  pay  to
get  the  license.  And  for  us,  that  is  really  the  biggest  problem.  We
would be happy often to have the exclusive, but it is a difficult deci-
sion  for  our  management  to  justify,  to  go  into  a  very  open-ended
situation,  especially  if  we  have  contributed  more  than  just  money
to  fund  the  project.  If  we  have  provided  background  research  re-
sults,  we  may  be  providing  noncommercial  samples  or  prototypes,
plus  input  from  our  researchers.  So,  in  that  case,  we  have  made  a
pretty  significant  investment,  and  having  an  open-ended  situation
is really very difficult for us to live with.

Chairman  WU.  Well,  what  Mr.  Johnson  said  earlier  makes  me
think  that  this  course  of  dealing,  a  long  course  of  dealing  between
a private entity and a university, helps establish some parameters,
and  it  makes  me  think  that,  perhaps,  if  there  were,  shall  we  say,
a range of reason, that if you were getting a license to license, that
if one had a range of reason set of expectations, I mean, that is one
of the problems, that there might not be that.

Do  any  of  the  other  witnesses  have  a  comment  on  this,  before  I

turn to the next set of—please proceed.

101

Dr.  LEMLEY.  Just  briefly,  I  think  part  of  the  problem  is  one  of
bureaucratic  structure  and  incentives.  If  you  are  dealing  with  an
office  of  technology  licensing  that  is  judged  at  the  university  by
how  much  money  it  generates  in  licensing  revenue  at  the  end  of
the  day,  their  incentives  are  different,  and  not  necessarily  aligned
with  the  incentives  of  the  broader  university.  And  one  of  the
things,  I  think,  that  distinguishes  Mr.  Johnson’s  more  enlightened
or  easier  to  deal  with  universities,  and  I  am  delighted  to  see  mine
on  the  list,  is  that  the  relationship  is  a  broader  one.  It  is  not  just
with  a  discrete  office  of  technology  licensing.  It  is  with  a  broader
group.  It  is  with  individual  departments,  and  the  office  of  tech-
nology  licensing  has  an  understanding  that  maximizing  revenue  is
one goal, but it is not the only goal.

Chairman  WU.  And  Dr.  Allen,  feel  no  compulsion  to  comment,

but if you would like.

Dr.  ALLEN.  So,  very  briefly,  I  would  just  point  out  that  of  the
vast majority of industry contracts that I have in my lab at Georgia
Tech,  they  are  either  donations  from  industry,  who  have  given
money  for  support  of  students  or  what  have  you  without  any  con-
cern for intellectual property issues, or they are exactly the type of
contract  that  are  being  discussed  where,  in  consideration  for  the
sponsorship of the research contract, a nonexclusive, royalty-free li-
cense is given for the foreground intellectual property.

So, I know it is possible.
Chairman WU. Thank you. Dr. Gingrey.
Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I hope my question
is  not  the  same  question.  I  think  when  you  got  into  your  second
five minute round, you may have touched on what I wanted to give
Dr.  Allen  an  opportunity  to  discuss.  Georgia  Tech  is  one  of  those
that  were  mentioned,  the  five  or  six  research  universities  that  in-
dustry,  whether  it  is  Dow  Chemical  or  Hewlett-Packard,  has  been
fond  of  the  relationship,  if  you  will.  I  want  to  specifically  ask  Dr.
Allen,  because  you  mentioned  some  with  Georgia  Tech  that  moved
a  number  of  innovations  from  the  lab  into  real  commercial  prod-
ucts.

What  do  you  think  are  the  characteristics  of  Georgia  Tech  that

allow it to be so effective at this process?

Dr. ALLEN. I think that——
Mr. GINGREY. And like universities?
Dr.  ALLEN.  Yes,  of  course.  I  believe  that  one  of  the  things  that
Georgia  Tech  has  always  had  a  history  of  is  a  long  relationship
with  industry,  a  relationship  that  has  been  focused  on  being  able
to  do  the  applied  end  of  engineering  research  in  terms  of  a  broad
spectrum,  so  we  certainly  have  our  basic  science  departments,  but
we  span  a  broad  spectrum  all  the  way  to  applied  engineering,  and
even  to  work  that  is  done  not  with  students,  of  course,  but  work
for the government, which is kept classified.

As  a  result,  I  think  that  there  has  been  a  value,  placed  on  the
faculty,  or  the  faculty  have  felt  that  there  is  value  in  commer-
cialization,  so  in,  and  it  is  certainly  not  a  universal  sentiment.
Some  faculty  feel  that  commercialization  is  something  that  should
be left to others. I believe at the universities that are cited by Mr.
Johnson, there is a feeling that commercialization is part and par-
cel  of  what  at  least  the  engineering  faculty  are  supposed  to  be

doing.  In  some  sense,  it  is  a  final  validation  of  the  engineering  re-
search  that  we  are  doing,  if  at  the  end  of  it,  someone  is  willing  to
pay for using that particular product.

I  also  think  that  one  of  the  things  that  we  don’t  do  at  Georgia
Tech is that we don’t look to the value of licensing revenue as add-
ing  to  a  huge  percentage  of  the  industry  income.  And  I  hesitate  to
read  these  numbers  into  the  Congressional  Record,  because  I  am
doing  them  from  memory,  but  I  believe  that  annually,  the  Georgia
Tech does about $80 million of industry research, which represents
about  21  percent  of  Georgia  Tech’s  total  research  budget,  and  of
that, about 1 percent is revenue from licensing.

And  so,  if  you  look  at  these  numbers,  and  say  well,  I  am  going
to double the licensing revenue, perhaps, and cut the industry con-
tracts by a factor of two, I don’t think that anyone at Georgia Tech
would  be  very  happy  with  that.  So,  I  think  that  that  is  another
piece  of  what  we  do,  is  to  make  sure  that  the  technology  licensing
is  serving  the  industry  contract  piece,  rather  than  the  other  way
around.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Any  other  comments  from  witnesses?  Yes,  Dr.

Dr. BUTTS. I would like to make a comment. I think what we are
seeing at an institution like Georgia Tech is very enlightened lead-
ership around the whole process of working with industry, and the
recognition that quickly coming to an agreement is really beneficial
to  both  parties,  and  that  both  benefit  more  by  doing  that  than  by
either  one  holding  out  to  try  to  get  the  best  possible  deal.  So,  I
think  institutions  where  there  is  a  recognition  that  this  is  a  good
thing,  to  have  these  research  projects  go  forward,  and  have  these
collaborations  occur,  and  all  the  benefits  that  come  from  those,  in-
cluding  opportunities  for  students  and  things,  is  worth  not  wor-
rying about, perhaps, losing a little bit on the financial side.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  I  will  yield  back,

and look forward to the next round.

Chairman WU. Thank you very much. Dr. Allen, you refer to per-
haps regulatory oversight, and Dr. Lemley, you refer to, essentially,
important  Congressional  oversight  function  in  making  Bayh-Dole
and  technology  transfer  in  general  work  a  little  bit  better.  What
kind of oversight do you all have in mind, and I would like to have
the  other  witnesses  comment  on  this,  to  the  extent  that  you  all
have some thoughts on this also. Dr. Lemley or Dr. Allen.

Dr.  ALLEN.  I  think  oversight  can  be  performed  at  many  levels,
and  one  of  the  ones  that  comes  to  mind  immediately  to  me  is
whether  or  not,  and  I  almost  hesitate  to  use  this  term,  the  trade
association,  if  you  will,  or  perhaps,  the  Association  of  University
Technology  Managers,  might  not  be  a  place  where  there  is  peer
pressure based oversight to make sure that these sorts of favorable
intellectual property provisions that we have talked about, are im-
plemented  in  the  appropriate  places.  I  think  that  that  is  certainly
a place to start, rather than, perhaps, immediately leaping to Con-
gressional oversight.

There  is  a  motion  to  do  this.  My  understanding,  we  heard  men-
tioned  earlier  the  Nine  Points  to  Consider  of  the  AUTM,  and  per-
haps,  that  is  a  place  that  we  can  start,  and  build  upon  within  the
university community.

Dr.  LEMLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  what  I  was  referring  to  in  my  testi-
mony  is  something  that  is  already  in  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  Section
203 of the Patent Code, which leaves open the possibility that fed-
erally  funded  inventions  that  are  patented  and  licensed  under
Bayh-Dole,  are  subject  to  what  are  called  march-in  rights,  in  cir-
cumstances in which the agency doing the funding determines that
the invention is either not being licensed appropriately, or has been
licensed  exclusively  to  someone  who  is  not,  in  turn,  commer-
cializing  it.  That  provision,  I  think,  gives  the  government,  and  the
agencies  who  are  most  directly  responsible  for  funding  the  inven-
tion, a decent amount of discretion and power to solve problems as
they arise, at least in theory.

It  has,  in  practice,  never  been  used.  Perhaps  that  is  because  we
have never run into one of these situations, but I think it may also
be  that  there  is  a  bit  of  unnecessary  timidity  on  the  part  of  the
agencies to be the first one to actually exercise this right.

Chairman  WU.  Well,  Dr.  Lemley,  since  you  are  speaking,  let  me
invite  you  to  continue.  Stanford  did  some  interesting  nonexclusive
licensing, starting, I believe, in the late ’70s and maybe early ’80s.
The  shape  of  our  biotechnology  industry  would  be  very,  very  dif-
ferent  had  those  licenses  been  exclusive,  rather  than  nonexclusive.
To  the  extent  that  you  are  familiar  with  the  history,  can  you  tell
us how Stanford, or the tech licensing folks at Stanford, went about
the university’s decision to make those nonexclusive, and therefore,
broadly practicable licenses?

Dr.  LEMLEY.  As  I  understand  it,  and  this  is  secondhand,  my  un-
derstanding,  in  particular,  of  the  licensing  of  the  licensing  of  the
Cohen-Boyer  patents  on  DNA,  which  were  the  fundamental  Cali-
fornia and Stanford patents, was that they were nonexclusive, and
available to all comers, in significant part because the National In-
stitutes  of  Health  required  that  they  be,  or  at  least,  strongly  en-
couraged  it.  This  was  in  the  time  prior  to  Bayh-Dole,  so  there
weren’t rules with respect to university patenting that were across
the  board.  Individual  government  departments  set  up  their  own
rules,  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  strongly  encouraged
nonexclusive licensing.

I don’t know, I wasn’t around, and I haven’t talked to the people
at  Stanford  at  the  time,  whether  that  is  something  they  would
have  done  anyway  in  the  absence  of  that  government  encourage-
ment.

Chairman  WU.  I  am  afraid  I  am  showing  that  I  am  getting  long
in  the  tooth.  I  was  a  student  hanging  around  during  those  days,
but  of  course,  I  didn’t  know  any  of  that  was  going  on.  Actually,
there  were  some  professors,  saying  that  they  had  something  inter-
esting, but they didn’t think that there would ever be any commer-
cial value to it.

Following  up  on  that,  if  we  do  have,  in  some  respects,  a  divide
between  some  of  the  life  sciences  and  some  of  the  chemical  com-
pounds, and let us just say, call it the world of electronics and soft-
ware,  where  there  is  a  lot  of  cross-licensing,  and  cycle  times  are  a
lot  higher,  would  a  parallel  approach,  where  individual  agencies
that  are  grant-giving  agencies,  have  some  more  leeway,  and  have
some  more  influence  over  setting  up  some  guidelines  for  tech  li-
censing,  would  that  be  helpful  to  some  of  the  problems  that  Dr.

Butts  and  Mr.  Johnson,  you  all  have  experienced  from,  you  know,
sitting  from  your  perspective.  And  Arun,  we  will  get  you  your
chance to comment on that, too.

Dr. BUTTS. Actually, our problems don’t really occur when we try
to  license  inventions  that  came  from  federal  funding.  I  think  we
understand  how  that  process  occurs.  It  is  more  when  we  want  to
invest  in  the  research,  and  make  sure  that  we  understand  what
rights  we  will  have  to  the  resulting  intellectual  property.  And  I
think it would be hard, there, for the federal agencies to have very
much constructive impact.

In  fact,  my  belief  is  that  Bayh-Dole  really  shouldn’t  apply  in
cases  where  the  company  is  funding  that  research,  and  I  think
what would be helpful is a clarification that that really was not the
intention of Congress that Bayh-Dole would apply to every research
project going on in the university, regardless of the source of fund-
ing.

Chairman WU. We will come back to that in the next round. Mr.

Johnson or——

Mr.  JOHNSON.  So,  I  have—well,  I  have  a  different  industry,  but
I would say that the whole issue around the understanding of this
as  an  issue  needs  to  get  raised.  You  know,  we  have  done  work  for
three  or  four  years  at  GUIRR,  under  the  National  Academies.  I
think there needs to be a National Academy level discussion about
what  the  needs  of  these  two  industries  are,  and  that  people  would
better understand what good approaches would end up with, when
we would go about this.

I  just  think  the  conversation  ends  up  at  the  wrong  level.  Our
work  in  the  Bay  Area,  we  found  there  were  a  lot  of  belief  systems
that  operate  below  the  radar  screen,  that  basically  make  people
feel  that  this  is  a  money-maker,  and  in  fact,  when  you  look  at  our
industry,  it  is  not.  So,  it  is  a  lose-lose.  So,  I  think  a  discussion
needs to go on at some place. Maybe the National Academies would
be  the  right  place,  but  some  convening  power,  where  everybody
would  really  understand  what  the  issues  are  here.  It  is  really  a
lack of understanding.

Chairman  WU.  We  are  starting  that  conversation  today,  but  you
are  right.  We  may  need  to  take  it  somewhere  else.  Mr.  Pradhan,
if  you  have  any  comments,  and  then,  we  will  flip  it  back  over  to
Dr. Gingrey.

Mr. PRADHAN. Just a very brief comment that, as Dr. Butts sug-
gested, that the role of federal agencies is not necessarily to deter-
mine  what  happens  to  inventions  from  industry-university  collabo-
rations.  That  actually  falls  on  different  shoulders,  and  has  to  do
with  tax  laws  and  what  is  defined  as  unrelated  business  income
tax.  And  so,  there  are  multiple  issues,  as  always,  that  come  into
a  decision-making  process,  and  it  is  not  just  one  regulation  or  one
set of policies or the other.

Chairman WU. Thank you. Dr. Gingrey.
Mr. GINGREY. I was discussing with my staff, earlier today, in re-
gard  to  preparation  for  this  hearing,  and  I  asked  them  a  question,
and  I  think  that  they  satisfactorily  answered  my  question,  and  I
know  that  you  will  do  the  same.  So  I  already  anticipate  the  an-
swer,  but  it  may  be  that  some  of  the  people  that  are  in  the  room
today  would  like  to  hear  this  question.  The  Federal  Government,

through its various and sundry programs, sponsors research in our
public and private colleges and universities across the country, and
it  is  not  an  insignificant  amount  of  money,  whether  it  is  coming
through  the  National  Science  Foundation’s  budget  or  wherever.
And then, one of these home runs occur.

My  question  to  them  was,  how  does  the  taxpayer,  that  is  gener-
ating  all  this  revenue,  the  $3  trillion  or  so  that  we  seem  to  spend
every  year,  how  do  they  get  reimbursed?  Why  don’t  they  have  an
exclusive  license  or  a  royalty  position  in  regard  to  one  of  these
home  run  discoveries?  And  I  would  just  like  to  hear  you  comment
on  that,  and  your  general  impression  of  maybe  a  misperception  in
regard  to  that,  and  we  can  start  from  my  left  to  right  with  Dr.
Pradhan.

Mr. PRADHAN. Thank you, Mr. Gingrey.
It is—every invention that gets licensed out of an academic insti-
tution  needs  substantial  development  that  needs  to  happen,  and
there is an issue of taking the revenues from that licensing and re-
investing  it,  and  universities  have  effectively  done  that,  so  any
amount  of  income  that  comes  in  is  reinvested  into  the  system.
Bayh-Dole  requires  that  we  share  those  revenues  with  the  inven-
tors,  which  we  do,  and  then,  we  reinvest  a  majority,  if  not  all  of
it, into the research and education enterprise, and the training en-
terprise of the university. So, I think that the public has a net ben-
efit that arises from that.

Dr.  BUTTS.  I  think  the  foundation  behind  Bayh-Dole  is  that  the
public benefits, because the product gets into the marketplace, and
you know, the question, I think you were raising is, is that fair, be-
cause  the  company  that  gets  the  license  gets  a  lot  of  benefit,  but
I  think  that  was  really  the  concept,  that  in  order  to  get  products
into the marketplace, you had to provide a business benefit, so that
companies  would  take  the  risk  and  make  the  investment  to  do  it.
Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  guess  I  would  similarly.  I  think,  you  know,  the
ability  for  companies  like  Hewlett-Packard  to  create  jobs,  and  to
create new industries in the United States, where people pay taxes,
and  have,  you  know,  a  viable  economic  sense  of  being,  is  really  a
result  of  this.  I  think  innovation  is  the  key  to  our  world  economic
competitiveness,  and  this  sort  of  research  allows  us  to  stay  ahead
of the curve. You know, everybody else in the rest of the world has
really  benchmarked  us,  China,  India,  Singapore,  they  have  taken
our  best  practices,  they  have  gone  off,  and  now,  they  are  com-
peting, and they are competing very well.

So,  I  think  the  degree  to  which  we  can  benefit  U.S.  companies

in the U.S., creating jobs, is really the way this gets paid back.

Dr.  LEMLEY.  Everything  that  the  three  witnesses  have  just  said
is true, but of course, it is true only in the circumstances in which
we  wouldn’t  have  gotten  the  commercialization  of  the  invention
that  was  federally  funded  without  Bayh-Dole  and  university  pat-
enting.  If  we  had  a  circumstance  in  which  we  would  have  gotten
the technology to the public without the patenting, and they would
have paid less money for it, then the public is contributing money,
but  they  are  not  getting  the  full  benefits  of  it.  And  that,  I  think,
is why there is a greater opportunity or role for the government to
have  this  occasional  oversight,  to  make  sure  that  the  results,  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00109 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

106

fruits of federally funded inventions aren’t locked up unfairly, or in
ways that might damage public health.

Dr.  ALLEN.  I  have  a  slightly  different  view  than  my  four  col-
leagues.  I  think  that  it  is  very  rare  that  the  home  run  invention
is worked on and available in the academic laboratory, to the point
where  it  is  ready  to  be  lifted  directly  from  the  laboratory  and  put
into commercialization. I quoted what turns out to be relatively in-
expensive  factor  of  $100  of  private  investment  required  for  every
dollar  of  public  investment,  and  I  heard  quoted,  The  Economist,
$10,000 of private investment for every dollar of public investment.
Certainly, it is true that this is going to be industry specific, but
I  think  that  unless  we  have  the  capability  of  exclusive  access  to
some  of  these  home  run  patents,  we  will  never  get  through,  in  my
particular case, the regulatory hurdles associated with a new med-
ical  device.  And  I  would  point  out  as  well  that  the  companies  that
are  commercializing  these  are  not  only  benefiting  themselves,  but
also,  all  of  their  employees,  all  of  the  new  jobs  that  are  created,
and so forth, a very important factor.

Mr. GINGREY. And I thank all of the panelists. And obviously, the
more  jobs,  the  more  people  pay  in  taxes,  the  multiplied  effect  of
that,  making  our  country  more  globally  competitive,  and  I  hope,  if
we  have  another  round,  that  I  will  get  an  opportunity  to  come
back,  and  maybe  ask  the  question  about  that  global  competitive-
ness as well.
Thank you.
Chairman  WU.  Dr.  Gingrey,  I  can  guarantee  you  another  round.
I  understand,  Dr.  Lemley,  that  you  may  have  a  flight  this  after-
noon, and we want to be sensitive to your schedule. And so, I think
that I have one further inquiry, based on comments that you made
earlier,  and  I  think  I,  and  the  rest  of  the  committee  would  dearly
appreciate your sticking with us as long as you possibly can.

You  mentioned  that  one  of  the  challenges,  one  of  the  opportuni-
ties  or  challenges,  is  to  get  universities  to  take  a  broader  view  of
their  role  in  society,  and  in  tech  transfer,  to  maximize  all  of  the
different roles, which a major research university should be playing
in  our  society.  What  are  some  of  the  things  that  can  be  done,  cul-
turally,  within  a  university,  or  statutorily,  or  through  financing
mechanisms, to encourage that kind of shift? What are some of the
things that might be helpful in reorganizing the tech transfer func-
tion  within  a  university,  to  try  to  serve  that  broader  societal  func-
tion?

Dr.  LEMLEY.  It  is  an  important  question,  and  I  want  to  start  by
confessing  a  fair  bit  of  ignorance,  so  I  will  offer  some  suggestions,
but  there  are  people  far  more  qualified  than  I  to  talk  about  the
kind of organizational structure of universities.

But I think one thing that clearly can be done is the kind of best
practices benchmarking among universities that we have heard dis-
cussed here today. If it is, in fact, the case that from the industry’s
perspective, there are some universities that are perceived as hard
to  deal  with  and  others  that  are  perceived  as  easier  to  deal  with,
and  that  as  a  result,  university  collaborations  with  private  sectors
are  flowing  to  those  universities,  then  I  think  there  is  an  oppor-
tunity  for  a  trade  association,  like  AUTM,  to  sit  down  and  figure

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

107

out  what  does  make  that  work,  do  that  kind  of  best  practice
benchmarking.

The other thing I would suggest, with respect to the organization
of the universities is that the more isolated the technology transfer
office is from the mainstream life of research in the university, the
more likely I think we are to see the kind of short run, profit maxi-
mizing mentality that I was concerned about. And so, anything you
can  do  to  build  the  technology  transfer  office  more  clearly  into  the
Vice  Provost  for  Research  or  whatever  the  departmental  structure
is, to make sure that those technology transfer offices are rewarded
not  just  by  how  much  money  did  you  get,  but  also,  by  some  other
measure of number of collaborations or university satisfaction, and
probably, I think, also, the sort of logical endpoint of that is to dis-
courage  what  I  have  seen  some  universities  from  doing,  which  is
to  entirely  outsource  the  function  of  technology  transfer  to  a  pri-
vate company, that is just in the business of holding and licensing
university patents.

Chairman  WU.  Before  we  broaden  that  discussion  to  the  rest  of
the panel, let me ask you, Dr. Lemley, is there a problem with the
metrics?  Because  one  of  the  easy  things  to  do  when  you  are  run-
ning  a  business  or  running  any  kind  of  enterprise  is  to  count  dol-
lars, and you know, sometimes, you just count what you can count,
and  then,  you  wind  up  with  a  metric  that  doesn’t  serve  anyone
well.

Is there a problem with metrics in this arena?
Dr. LEMLEY. Yeah, I think there is, because as Mr. Johnson indi-
cated,  in  the  information  technology  industries,  a  lot  of  the  value
of  patents  to  private  companies  comes  not  in  the  form  of  revenue
that they generate, but in the form of cross-licensing or freedom to
operate,  and  that  is  the  sort  of  value,  those  inventions  have  the
sort  of  value  that  easily  gets  lost  if  all  we  are  counting  is  what  is
the percentage of the royalty, or what is the total number of dollars
that are coming in at the end of the day.

Chairman WU. Do any of you have suggestions about alternative

metrics, or as a best practices suggestion? Arun?

Mr. PRADHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
AUTM  has  been  engaged  in  an  effort  to  look  at  the  metrics  and
surveys that currently get published in the AUTM licensing survey.
Just  as  a  brief  point  of  history,  the  licensing  survey  began  in  the
early  ’90s,  as  a  means  of  benchmarking  institutions  with  each
other, to take a look at what activities were being performed by the
respective technology transfer offices.

Seventeen years later, the role of technology transfer, as we have
heard in this panel and in this discussion, has changed. We partici-
pate  much  more  in  economic  development.  We  participate  much
more in strategic alliances. The models for industry, the models for
the  way  that  industry  does  business,  have  changed,  and  over  the
last year, our Vice President for Metrics and Surveys has been en-
gaged  in  an  activity  with  the  funding  from  the  Kauffman  Founda-
tion  and  others,  to  review  what  additional  measures  need  to  be
looked at, what outcomes need to be looked at, not just activity.

Chairman WU. Mr. Johnson.
Mr. JOHNSON. You know, I think it comes back, so you get what
you measure, and if you are measuring licensing income, then peo-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

108

ple  will  be  eager  to  do  that.  I  think  that  is  90  percent  of  what  is
at the difficulty of the licensing offices that we have trouble negoti-
ating with. One of the major a-ha moments that I had in our work
out  in  the  Bay  Area  centered  around,  when  I  finally  realized  that
the  average  amount  of  industrial  or  sponsored  research  is  some-
where between 5 and 7 percent of the total research or the univer-
sity budget, depending on how you define it.

In the cases that have been mentioned previously, Georgia Tech,
and MIT would be another example, their amount of industry fund-
ing  is  on  the  order  of  20,  over  20  percent.  So,  again,  you  see  the
difference  in  philosophy  of  engaging  as  a  strategic  partner,  where
that  is  a  viable  outcome  of  the  work  that  faculty  are  supposed  to
be doing. It is part of the mission statement, but in the case of the
average, it is 5 to 6 percent, so you might ask well, what else could
you  measure?  Well,  companies  give  money  in  many  ways.  There
are grants that go without any licensing requirements at all. There
is philanthropy. There are gifts from companies. If you measure all
the  places  along  this  continuum,  you  can  see  that  if  you  pick  one
specific  area  that  generates  5  percent,  it  might  impact  all  of  the
others.  And  the  others  are  actually  much  bigger,  so  in  the  cases
that  work,  Berkeley  would  be  a  good  example,  the  Provost  there
has actually pulled the industry sponsored research and the licens-
ing  office  together,  and  they  are  measured  on  the  net  outcome  of
both. So, I think that is a best practice. That has actually substan-
tially  reduced  the  amount  of  time  that  we  take  to  negotiate  with
UC Berkeley.

Dr. BUTTS. I agree there are two ways to win, then, either to se-
cure  a  license,  or  to  have  a  sponsored  research  agreement.  So,  I
certainly feel that having, because there are typically two separate
offices  in  universities  that  deal  with  those  things,  so  if  you  have
both  technology  transfer  and  sponsored  programs  reporting  to  the
same  person,  then  there  is  the  ability  to  measure  that  bigger  im-
pact, whether it is in money coming in for research or money com-
ing  in  for  licensing.  So,  I  definitely  feel  that  that  is  what  distin-
guishes some of the universities that are easiest to work with.

Chairman WU. Thank you very much. Dr. Gingrey.
Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I  want  to  have  Dr.  Pradhan  comment  a  little  bit  about  the  Nine
Points, in regard to licensing university technology. Because I think
in his written testimony, that is a very interesting concept. But be-
fore  that,  I  want  to  turn  to  Dr.  Butts  and  Mr.  Johnson,  and  ask
this basic question.

What  are  the  reasons  your  companies,  maybe  Mr.  Johnson  feels
more  strongly  about  this,  Dr.  Butts,  than  you  do,  that  it  is  easier
to  deal  with  foreign  universities,  and  seek  partnerships  there?
Where  is  there  such  a  roadblock,  as  it  seemed  that  Mr.  Johnson
had  a  lot  of  heartburn  over?  Let  us  cut  to  the  chase  on  that,  and
tell us what the problems are, and maybe Dr. Pradhan can say how
the Nine Points recommendation could solve those problems.

Mr.  JOHNSON.  Well,  I  think  if  you  look  at  the  reasons  why  com-
panies  actually  do  research  overseas,  it  is  many  faceted.  Matter  of
fact, referenced in my testimony is the Thursby study called ‘‘Here
or There,’’ sponsored under GUIRR, and with Kauffman, about why
do  we  actually  go  to  do  this.  So,  part  of  the  answer  around  why

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

investments,  as 

the fact that our competitors out there, these are governments driv-
ing  university 
I  have  said  before,  have
benchmarked us, have looked at our best practices, and by the way,
I don’t think they think Bayh-Dole is a best practice, per se. I think
what they are looking at is the level of investment, the encourage-
ment of engineering graduates in the technology field of science.

So,  when  we  go  there,  they  are  eager  to  collaborate.  They  are
eager  to  compete.  We  have  significant  presences  in  all  those  coun-
tries, manufacturing and R&D. We go there for access to talent, the
access  to  the  resources  provided,  and  the  marketplace  that  we  are
trying to sell in. So, it is a combination of factors as to why we are
there  in  the  first  place.  Then,  when  we  get  there,  and  we  develop
the  partnerships,  we  find  that  this  eagerness  allows  them  to  want
to  participate  with  Hewlett-Packard  or  Microsoft  or  IBM.  They
really move rapidly to complete the research agreements. And it is
not really encumbered by any of the issues that we find in the U.S.
So,  we  are  there  for  certain  purposes  that  are  strategic  to  our
company, and then, the ease of doing business is much better, and
then,  we  run  into  the  roadblock  in  the  U.S.  at  some  places,  so  the
natural answer is to go there instead of here.

Dr.  BUTTS.  Well,  I  welcome  the  chance  to  address  this  question,
because  I  would  like  to  mention  something  that  hasn’t  come  up  in
our  discussion  today,  and  that  is  that  useful  inventions  are  rare
outcomes  from  sponsored  research  at  universities.  So,  in  fact,  one
of  the  reasons  why  foreign  universities  are  easier  to  collaborate
with  is  that  what  they  really  want  is  the  partnership.  They  would
like  to  have  the  funding  for  their  research,  and  they  would  like  to
have  the  opportunity  for  their  faculty  and  students  to  work  with
companies  who  are  providing  interesting  problems  for  them,  and
recognize  that  the  chances,  let  alone  a  home  run  invention,  but
even just an invention that is useful, are small.

So,  I  think  that  what  we  see  outside  the  U.S.  is  that  there  is  a
heavy  focus  on  the  value  of  the  research  partnership,  and  all  the
benefits  that  flow  from  that,  and  very  little  concern  about  what  if
there  is  a  patent.  So,  the  whole  approach  outside  the  U.S.  is  dif-
ferent, and it is really focused on the research and the partnership,
and  not  on  potential  value  of  investments  that  might  come  from
the research.

Mr. GINGREY. Dr. Pradhan.
Mr.  PRADHAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Gingrey.  The  Nine  Points  docu-
ment is something that establishes consistent guidelines across in-
stitutions. It is meant to be flexible. It is meant to promote licens-
ing  approaches,  as  the  introduction  suggests,  for  comparable  tech-
nologies, and does vary considerably from industry sector to indus-
try sector.

What  it  does  establish  are  the  protection  of  certain  core  values
that a university, or an academic institution has. For example, the
right  to  publish.  For  example,  the  making  research  tools  broadly
available  across  industry  sectors,  as  well  as  to  other  institutions.
The  right  to  practice  the  licensed  technology,  and  allow  other  aca-
demic institutions to practice that technology, as well.

So,  then,  extrapolate  that  to  also  successful  practices,  and  work-
ing  with  companies  on  research.  In  terms  of  using  similar  ap-
proaches, which is taking a look at things by, sector by sector, pre-

serving  rights  to  use  it  ourselves,  and  then,  moving  forward.  So,  I
think  it  starts  the  process  of  consistent  implementation  of  Bayh-
Dole.

Chairman WU. Thank you, Dr. Gingrey.
I  would  like,  in  a  few  minutes,  to  turn  to  whether  some  of  the
Nine  Points  would  be  basis  for  more  of  a  guideline  focus.  Now,  we
have  just  spent  some  time  talking  about  changes  that  one  might
make in the university enterprise. I would like to focus now on the
phenomenon  of  going  overseas  with  sponsored  research,  and  to
what  extent  is  this  driven  by  sort  of,  if  you  will,  free  market  hun-
ger  for  collaboration,  and  to  what  extent  are  there  sometimes,  I
just  read  about  this  at  times,  if  you  want  to  sell  airplanes  in  cer-
tain  places,  there  is  a  co-production  requirement  at  times.  Are  we
facing  some  of  those  issues  in  sponsored  research,  as  we  look  at
Russia,  China,  India,  or  some  other  places  around  the  world?  Do
we run across that kind of conversation?

Dr. BUTTS. We have not encountered that, Chairman Wu. In fact,
our research with universities is often so far upstream that it is not
really  tightly  linked  to  our  manufacturing,  so  I  think  the  issue
comes  up  more  when  companies  want  to  market,  sell,  or  manufac-
ture in a foreign country. For the most part, our research is really
driven by the more fundamental side, and so, we have not encoun-
tered those sorts of requirements.

Mr. JOHNSON. I would say we encounter those from time to time,
and  I  think  it  is  more  about  if  you  fall  into  the  role  of  corporate
responsibility,  being  a  good  corporate  citizen.  If  you  are  HP,  and
you are only selling in that country, and they have a broader objec-
tive, we want to be their partner, their long-term partner.

Chairman  WU.  So,  it  may  not  be  expressly  said,  but  it  is  one  of

the, perhaps, understandings of life.

Mr.  JOHNSON.  It  is  implicit  that  you  are  investing,  I  mean,  the
best partnerships, and this includes the supply chain business, the
success of supply chains.

Chairman WU. Please proceed.
Mr.  JOHNSON.  The  success  of  supply  chains  is  sort  of  not  throw-
ing  it  over  the  wall  and  asking  people  to  come  up  with  the  lowest
price.  It  is  investing  in  your  other,  in  the  other  ecosystem.  So,  I
think  that  is  true  in  countries  around  the  world.  I  also  would  tell
you  that  there  are  many  countries  coming  to  us  with  research  in-
vestments,  laboratory  facilities,  saying  please  come  here,  we  want
HP or Microsoft or IBM to be part of this.

And there is a third situation that I can cite in Brazil, where the
tax  law  gives  an  incentive  to  work  with  universities.  Instead  of
paying taxes, we are allowed to invest as a tax nonpayment, to pay
it  into  research  that  we  fund  and  we  direct  inside  university  sys-
tems.  So,  I  mean,  that  is  a  win-win.  We  didn’t  pay  tax,  but  we
funded  research  inside  a  university.  So,  we  have  an  extensive
amount  of  university  research 
it  was  an
incentivization through the tax system, as one example.

in  Brazil,  but 

Chairman  WU.  Does  anybody  else  want  to  comment  on  this  fac-

tor, before we move on?

There  was  some  mention  of  Tax  Code  issues,  and  I  want  to  ask
about  that,  and  then,  Arun,  I  want  to  turn  to  you  for  other  poten-
tial  barriers  to  tech  transfer.  There  was  some  mention  of  tax

issues,  the  treatment  of  bonds  that  are  used  to  finance  buildings
and limitations on unrelated business income.

For  those  who  choose  to  or  want  to,  can  you  address  that  issue

for me briefly, clearly?

Dr.  BUTTS.  I  would  like  to  give  it  a  try.  I  will  do  my  best.  I  am
not a tax expert, but as you have already mentioned, many univer-
sities  use  tax  exempt  bonds  to  finance  building  facilities,  and  in
order  to  preserve  the  tax  exempt  status  of  the  bonds,  they  have
been  given  a  safe  harbor  by  the  IRS  with  regard  to  doing  collabo-
rative research. And basically, as long as they stay within that safe
harbor, they know that their bonds are protected.

And  the  safe  harbor  is  actually,  from  an  industry  standpoint,
pretty  small,  and  it  says  that  you  cannot  give  preference  to  a  re-
search sponsor in licensing foreground inventions, and that for uni-
versities  to  stay  in  that  safe  harbor,  they  have  to  be  careful  that
they  are  making  sure  that  they  can  show  that  they  are  licensing
an invention at a fair market value. If you don’t know what the in-
vention  is,  it  is  hard  to  show  that  if  you  agree  up  front  what  the
invention  is  going  to  cost,  that  it  is  a  fair  market  value.  So,  that
provision  really  makes  it  extremely  difficult  for  a  company  like
mine  to  have  the  assurance  that  we  would  like  that  we  are  going
to be able to execute a license that we feel is done at a reasonable
cost, if the university has to stay in that safe harbor.

Chairman  WU.  Anyone  else  wish  to  address  that  issue,  before
we—Mr.  Pradhan,  I  believe  that  in  your  written  testimony,  you
mentioned that there are some barriers to technology transfer. Can
you,  can  we  come  back  to  that,  and  address  what  barriers  you  are
talking about, what can be done to eliminate some barriers, wheth-
er they are real or perceived, what federal statutes there might be,
what State statutes there might be?

Mr. PRADHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  think  some  of  the  real  barriers  are  exactly  what  we  have  re-
ferred to here. The Tax Code, for example, is a potential barrier in
effective  collaborations  and  licensing.  There  are  perceived  barriers
with respect to positions that a particular entity might take in the
negotiation  process,  and  are  attributed  to  Bayh-Dole.  I  don’t  think
that  a  negotiation  is  anything  more  than  that.  It  is  a  negotiation,
and  also,  from  my  perspective,  from  my  personal  experience  in
working  with  companies,  and  we  have  discussed  this  a  little  bit,
when  you  are  able  to  sit  down  with  them  and  articulate  to  them
some  of  the  issues  with  respect  to,  for  example,  the  tax  laws,  the
business  model,  that  would  derive  benefit  for  an  academic  institu-
tion  versus,  so,  for  example,  nonexclusive,  royalty-free  licensing
versus exclusive licensing, that those barriers tend to go away.

So,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  one  of  the  most  effective  means  of
achieving  success  is  education,  but  not  only  at  the  academic  insti-
tution  level,  but  also,  at  a  company  level.  I  think  we  understand
some  of  the  issues  that  relate  to  us.  We  are  not  as  cognizant  of
some  of  the  issues,  as  they  relate  to  companies.  And  the  flip  side
of  that  is  also  true,  that  they  understand  some  of  the  issues  that
are  very  important  to  them,  but  don’t  completely  understand  the
issues as they relate to academic institutions.

So,  in  very  brief  summary,  I  think  it  is  a  matter  of  educating
both sides, with respect to effective means of establishing licensing
partnerships, as well as research partnerships.

Chairman  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  think  I  heard  most  of
that,  but  the  rest  of  it,  I  will  read  from  the  written  record.  My
apologies  to  you  all,  or  perhaps  you  will  be  relieved.  We  do  have
a  series  of  seven  or  eight  votes  coming  up,  and  I  think  that  the
right  thing  and  the  humane  thing  to  do  is  to  recess  the  panel  in
about ten minutes.

A couple of you have obliquely, or perhaps a little bit more than
obliquely,  referred  to  issues  where  despite  the  fact  that  research
may be privately funded, that the direct research is privately spon-
sored  research,  that  there  is  a  line  drawing  challenge  in  negoti-
ating  with  universities,  and  that  this  is  probably  a  challenge  on
both,  for  both  parties,  but  what  a  university  takes  title  to,  versus
what  is,  shall  we  say,  sponsored  research  uncontaminated  by  fed-
eral funds. For those who choose to address this issue, can you illu-
minate  the  outlines  of  that  issue  a  little  bit  more  for  the  Com-
mittee?

Dr. BUTTS. I would like to address that issue. I think that we see
a  whole  range  of  ways  of  looking  at  how  Bayh-Dole  should  apply,
and  one  that  I  frequently  hear  from  universities  is  the  statement,
if  one  federal  dollar  touches  your  project,  then  Bayh-Dole  has  to
apply.  And  I  think  in  reading  the  implementing  regulations  that
that  clearly  was  not  the  intention,  and  that  what  you  really  need
to do is look at the statement of work for the program that is being
funded privately, and if, in fact, it is not overlapping with any work
that  is  being  funded  by  the  Federal  Government,  then  I  think
Bayh-Dole should not apply.

But  I  think  there  is  some  concern  in  the  university  community
about not doing something that will cause difficulty with their fed-
eral  sponsors,  so  the  easy  answer  is  take  a  very  broad  interpreta-
tion,  and  say  because  we  have  so  much  federal  money  in  our  lab-
oratories, there is no way that your project cannot somehow be, can
run without being impacted by federal dollars.

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  agree  with  Susan’s  comments.  It  is  sort  of  a
mine,  yours,  or  ours  kind  of  thing.  I  mean,  this  ought  to  be  just
common  sense,  but  when  you  look  at  the  complexity  of  looking  at
prior background IP across, say, the entire University of California
system,  to  determine  whether  they  have  looked  at,  and  you  have
made  sure  that  any  possible  connection  to  your  research  has  been
identified, it is a daunting task by itself.

So, if you are making a bet on this, and you have got a large in-
stitution,  and  there  is  all  this  uncertainty,  then  what  do  you  do?
And that, again, causes a breakdown. So, it is more common sense
that  well,  this  is  fundamentally  mine,  or  mostly  yours,  and  I  am
just  trying  to  buy  into  it.  Those  are  the  sort  of  conclusions  we
would  like  to  make  rapidly,  but  this  thing  overhangs  it,  and  it  is
difficult.

arena?

Chairman  WU.  Would  legislative  clarification  be  helpful  in  this

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  will  go  out  on  a  limb,  and  say  I  think  it  might
be,  in  this  particular  case,  just  because,  you  know,  the  idea,  as
Susan  pointed  out,  just  touching  something.  I  mean,  the  Federal

Government  funds  just  about  every  kind  of  research  that  I  know,
so I am sure I am going to touch some of it. So, some clarity there,
I think would be helpful.

Chairman WU. Other viewpoints on that particular question?
Mr.  PRADHAN.  I  think  it  would  be  possibly  a  wrong  path  to  go
down,  and  provide  legislative  oversight  along  those  lines.  I  think
the issue is more of——

Chairman  WU.  Do  you  agree  that  there  is  an  essential  problem

here?

Mr.  PRADHAN.  Yes,  I  do,  but  I  don’t  think  it  is  rooted  in  Bayh-
Dole.  I  think  it  is  rooted  in  value  allocation  of  what  has,  or  going
to  be  created.  I  think  it  is  also  based  on  the  relative  contributions
that the two parties, or the three parties make to whatever occurs.
It is a question of access, and it is a question of control, and——
Chairman  WU.  Mr.  Pradhan,  then,  at  what  relative  contribution
would  you  say  this  is  sponsored  research,  privately  sponsored  re-
search,  and  not  subject  to,  shall  we  say,  Bayh-Dole  contamination,
and  at  what  percentage  would  you  say  that  this  vests  in  the  uni-
versity?

Mr. PRADHAN. I don’t think—sorry.
Chairman WU. Please proceed.
Mr.  PRADHAN.  I  don’t  think  universities  take,  or  all  universities
take  the  position  of  Bayh-Dole  contamination.  I  don’t  believe  that
that  is  an  issue  here.  We  take  a  position,  where  we  have  our  fac-
ulty,  who  are  our  employees,  and  by  policy,  need  to  assign  to  uni-
versities  intellectual  property  that  is  created  as  a  result  of  their
work. If the issue is, then, assignment of that intellectual property
back  to  a  particular  company  for  further  development,  yeah,  we
need to take a look at that carefully, and sometimes, we do, for ex-
ample, in clinical trials that we conduct, take into account what is
being  brought  to  the  table  by  the  company.  That  is  a  model  that
we can effectively use for other means, as well.

Chairman  WU.  My  apologies,  Mr.  Pradhan,  but  because  there  is
a vote clock ticking, I would like to move the discussion along, but
let  us  come  back,  perhaps,  you  all  have  some  written—things  that
you would like to submit in writing.

As  I  was  reviewing  this  issue,  one  of  the  questions  that  devel-
oped in my mind, for Dr. Butts and Mr. Johnson, we could address
this  legislatively,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  going  into  the  relation-
ship  of  sponsored  research,  that  to  the  extent  there  is  an  issue
here,  if  it  is  not  taken  care  of  by  the  relationship,  that  a  private
entity,  a  sponsoring  entity,  could  get  representations  and  warran-
ties,  and  an  undertaking  from  the  university.  You  can  already  tell
that,  you  know,  I  am  the  kind  of  guy  that  you  don’t  like  to  get  in-
volved  in  technology  licensing,  but  you  could  get  those  reps  and
warranties  from  the  university,  that  this  is  sponsored  research.
Why doesn’t that take care of it up front?

Dr. BUTTS. I just think that the issue of being able to clearly de-
fine when are federal dollars involved and when are they not is dif-
ficult,  and  I  have  had  people  say  to  me,  well,  in  order  to  do  what
you are suggesting, Mr. Chairman, this faculty member would have
to move into a different building and work in a separate laboratory,
so  that  there  was  basically  no  federal  funding  in  the  area,  which
I  think  is  really  more  than  the  Act  requires,  but  it  is  that  level  of

114

certainty that I think many people want to have, in order to make
sure  that  they  are  not  somehow  failing  to  meet  the  obligations
under Bayh-Dole.

So  I  think,  you  know,  some  clarity  about  is  it  really  that  nec-
essary to totally segregate the research, or is there a way that fed-
eral  dollars  and  industry  dollars  can  be  funding  separate  projects,
and still be, not have Bayh-Dole apply, I think would be very help-
ful.

Chairman WU. Dr. Allen.
Dr.  ALLEN.  Briefly,  I  think  that  this  is  a  very  important  point.
I  think  it  is,  in  some  sense,  almost  independent  of  Bayh-Dole.  I
think if industry comes to my laboratory to do some research, part
of the reason is because I have built up, or I, by extension, Georgia
Tech, have built up over the years expertise in an area that is very
valuable to that particular industry.

And so, I do agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the way to solve
the  issue  of  who  is  contributing  1  percent,  or  99  percent,  or  what-
ever  it  is,  to  the  ultimate  collaboration,  is  one  to  be  negotiated  be-
tween the private parties, as opposed to bringing in the Bayh-Dole
situation.

Chairman  WU.  Perhaps  you  all  are  relieved,  but  I  apologize  for
needing to bring this hearing to a close. It would not be fair to you,
or  to  the  other  attendees,  to  recess  for  seven  or  eight  votes,  and
then to come back.

I  do  feel  that  we  have  just  barely  scratched  the  surface  of  this
very important, large topic. It is my intention to return to this sub-
ject, and to try to get it right, rather than to get it fast, and some-
times, one of the most difficult things to do around this institution,
do  nothing.  And  we  will  consider  carefully  what  the  right  things
are  to  do  for  the  next  generation  of  Bayh-Dole,  which  will  affect,
I believe, several future generations of Americans.

I did not have a chance to discuss some of my experiences, either
with  domestic  universities  or,  in  particular,  with  foreign  univer-
sities, and whether the challenge is changing American conduct, or
whether the challenge is in, perhaps, developing standards for con-
duct elsewhere in the world. We will return to these subjects.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements  from  members,  and  I  do  hope  that  we  will  be  able  to
ask you all questions, and that you will continue to help us in our
consideration of these issues.

Without  objection,  so  ordered.  The  hearing  is  now  adjourned.

Thank you all very, very much.

[Whereupon, at 3:12 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Arundeep  S.  Pradhan,  Director,  Technology  and  Research  Collabora-
tions,  Oregon  Health  &  Science  University;  Vice  President  for  Annual  Meetings
and Board of Trustees, Association of University Technology Managers

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Impact of Federal Statutes
Q1. Several  witnesses  commented  in  their  testimony  that  Bayh-Dole  is  only  one  of
several federal statutes that play a role in shaping the interactions and relation-
ships between universities and industry. What are other important statutes, and
how,  if  in  any  way,  do  they  discourage  technology  transfer,  and  industry-spon-
sored university research? Do you see bright line rules which would help univer-
sities lower the perceived risk of the loss of non-profit status or federal research
funding?

A1. The  impact  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  on  research  and  university-industry  inter-
actions  has  been  much  more  positive  than  negative.  Comments  made  by  my  col-
leagues  on  the  panel  seem  to  imply  that  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  discourages  university-
industry research relations. This is erroneous.

University-industry  relations  encompass  a  variety  of  relationships,  such  as  col-
laborations,  multi-party  consortia,  material  transfers,  government-university-indus-
try partnerships, sponsored research agreements, and licensing arrangements. Each
relationship  is  defined  by  a  set  of  complex  issues  of  which  patent  ownership  (the
issue  addressed  by  the  Bayh-Dole  Act)  is  one.  Other  issues  relate  to  research  con-
ducted  in  tax-exempt  bond  financed  facilities;  valuation  of  inventions  that  have  yet
to be created; the nature of the industry sector; and, the desire of companies to ne-
gotiate payment of the full burden of expenses associated with research (reimburse-
ment  of  Facilities  &  Administrative  costs).  In  addition,  the  mission  of  a  company
typically  focuses  on  generating  revenue  through  commercialization  of  products  and
is  fundamentally  different  from  that  of  a  university  that  focuses  on  research,  edu-
cation  and  public  service.  The  Bayh-Dole  Act  remains  supportive  and  flexible  to
allow  universities  to  address  these  issues  and  the  financial  support  of  a  particular
university research laboratory.

One  of  the  other  panelists  raised  the  impact  of  the  federal  rules  governing  tax-
exempt bond financing. While these rules present limitations to pre-determining the
value  for  a  future  unknown  invention,  they  do  not  change  the  fundamental  prin-
ciples of universities to retain ownership of their technology, determine appropriate
values  for  commercial  use  of  federally-funded  technology,  and  ensure  that  these
public  assets  are  appropriately  developed  for  maximum  utilization  to  benefit  the
public. Therefore, any changes to such laws would not alter significantly the univer-
sity-industry relationship.

Even  without  the  issues  created  by  tax-exempt  bond  financing,  there  are  real
problems in establishing a value for technology that is yet to be created, as neither
the company nor the university know the actual market for the technology or what
further  development  will  be  necessary  to  bring  the  technology  to  market.  Further,
trying to pre-value the unknown inventions would create greater contention between
the  respective  parties  as  each  party  would  have  an  incentive  to  value  unknown  in-
ventions at either extreme of the spectrum. As I have stated in my prior testimony,
the issues are mainly based on the cultural distinctions between the different indus-
try  sectors  and  that  the  nature  of  the  transaction  is  a  negotiation  which  needs  to
be conducted in good faith.

In  addition,  the  Stevenson-Wydler  Technology  Innovation  Act  (15  U.S.C.  3710  et
seq.)  provides  the  basis  for  federal  agencies  and  laboratories  to  enter  into  Coopera-
tive  Research  and  Development  Agreements  (CRADAs).  CRADAs  encourage  tech-
nology  transfer  from  federal  laboratories  (including  some  managed  by  universities
and some in collaboration with universities) to the private sector.

In  summary,  I  do  not  believe  that  federal  statutes  play  a  significant  role  in  dis-
couraging  university  industry  research  relations.  Rather  the  opposite,  federal  stat-
utes  encourage  and  require  such  beneficial  relationships.  In  addition  universities
would and do accommodate industry’s desire to know the commitments for research
collaborations and follow-on licensing to the extent that we reasonable can.

Impact of State Laws
Q2. You noted in your testimony that since 2005, 19 states have launched initiatives
targeting innovation by investing in university R&D—including R&D incentives

and  tax  incentives  for  the  private  sector  to  partner  with  universities.  How  do
State  laws  shape  the  university-industry  collaboration  environment?  Do  these
laws pose any additional barriers, beyond those created by some federal statutes,
for university-industry collaboration? Please explain.

A2. Most  State  laws  are  flexible  to  encourage  university-industry  collaborations  in
various  fields  of  research.  Very  few  states  have  enacted  legislation  that  requests  a
share  of  the  licensing  income  and/or  require  that  technology  developed  be  first  li-
censed to local companies or be the basis of start-up companies in the name of eco-
nomic development. Where such State laws and regulations exist, they may pose ob-
stacles  in  venturing  with  out-of-state  companies  and  leveraging  State  and  federal
funds together. On the other hand, States laws that provide R&D tax credits to cor-
porations who fund research in the state encourage these important research invest-
ments.

The initiatives that I have outlined in my written testimony and other initiatives
of  which  I  am  aware,  do  not  limit  the  interactions  of  universities  to  local  and  re-
gional  economies.  The  initiatives  capitalize  on  the  ability  of  universities  to  retain
ownership  of  intellectual  property,  function  as  engines  for  economic  growth  in  the
region,  and  partner  with  companies  across  a  wide  range  of  disciplines.  I  am  not
aware of any of these State laws creating additional barriers for university-industry
collaboration.

Overseas University-Industry Collaboration Trends
Q3. Industry  witnesses  expressed  concern  that  policies  at  some  universities  are  dis-
couraging university-industry cooperation, and, as a result, companies are turn-
ing  to  conduct  sponsored  research  overseas.  How  are  universities  tracking  these
international  developments  and  how  are  universities  responding?  Are  there
changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  statute  that  are  needed  to  respond  to  these  develop-
ments?

A3. Policies  at  universities  protect  academic  freedom,  education  of  students,  integ-
rity of the research enterprise, and utilization of research results for the public ben-
efit  and  do  not  discourage  university-industry  research  collaborations.  The  issue  is
one  of  negotiation  and  a  meeting  of  the  minds  to  achieve  a  mutually  beneficial  ar-
rangement. Companies expand overseas due to pressures of globalization, not mere-
ly  because  U.S.  universities  are  hard  to  deal  with.  As  Mr.  Johnson  indicated  in  his
testimony, there are multiple factors that are taken into consideration; for example,
building  R&D  centers  and  working  with  overseas  universities  often  are  a  response
to  penetrating  overseas  markets.  To  blame  U.S.  universities  for  companies
outsourcing  R&D  to  foreign  universities  is  deceptive.  The  relatively  few  firms  that
assert  that  U.S.  universities  are  difficult  to  work  with  claim  that  overseas  univer-
sities are willing to agree to different terms than U.S. universities, but overseas uni-
versities have different histories, interests and drivers.

The  approach  of  U.S.  industry  in  chasing  ‘‘easy’’  foreign  universities  strikes  me
as  the  same  short-sightedness  that  led  to  the  concerns  that  resulted  in  the  Bayh-
Dole Act. In addition, most major foreign universities either have or soon will have
policies  similar  to  U.S.  universities.  Many  countries  are  investing  heavily  in  their
universities  to  entice  companies  to  establish  bases  there  and  to  benefit  from  sub-
sidized  research.  As  foreign  universities  gain  more  experience  they  will  recognize
the  importance  of  intellectual  property  in  preserving  the  integrity  of  their  research
programs as well as the damage generated by giving away all of their valuable intel-
lectual property for quick revenue enhancement. These universities will become less
likely  to  assign  away  ownership  of  invention  rights  that  are  critical  to  continuing
their research, ensuring that graduating students and collaborators can continue to
utilize  their  research  results,  attracting  future  research  funding,  and  maximizing
utilization of their technologies in multiple fields of use. We are in fact seeing these
trends in Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan. AUTM is partnering with universities and
individuals,  who  are  very  interested  in  seeking  to  replicate  U.S.  models  of  tech-
nology transfer in these countries and others.

It  also  remains  the  case  that,  some  countries’  observation  of  international  agree-
ments  and  intellectual  property  rights  is  limited  at  best.  Trying  to  enforce  agree-
ments for example in China, India and other countries is challenging and costly.

In  fact,  many  multinationals  are  coming  from  overseas  to  U.S.  universities!  For-
eign-based multinational firms are building R&D centers near U.S. universities and
entering  into  long-term  collaborations.  Further,  these  relationships  are  established
on terms that both companies and the U.S. universities find acceptable! The compa-
nies  tell  us  our  terms  are  different  than  they  encounter  with  universities  overseas,
but they understand the issues of academic freedom, advancing research, protection

of  students,  intellectual  property  rights,  and  that  this  is  the  way  that  business  is
done in the U.S. and they see the advantages.

I would also like to point out that Dr. Gary Schuster, Provost and Vice President
for  Academic  Affairs  at  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology,  testified  in  the  July  26,
2007 hearing before the House Committee on Science and Technology on the impact
of globalization of R&D and innovation on American universities. Dr. Schuster stat-
ed  that  many  foreign  companies  are  establishing  research  collaborations  with  U.S.
universities.

According to the National Science Foundation’s 2006 Science and Engineering In-
dicators,  from  1997  to  2002,  R&D  investments  made  by  foreign  firms  in  the  U.S.
grew  faster  than  R&D  investments  made  abroad  by  U.S.-based  multinational  cor-
porations.  During  2002,  while  U.S.  affiliates  of  foreign  companies  accounted  for  5.7
percent  of  the  total  U.S.  private  industry  value,  R&D  conducted  by  U.S.  affiliates
of  foreign  companies  accounted  for  14.2  percent  of  the  industry  R&D  conducted  in
the U.S. This demonstrates that the process of globalization is at work with compa-
nies investing and seeking collaborations in other countries and that, foreign compa-
nies  are  able  to  successfully  enter  into  research  collaborations  with  U.S.  univer-
sities.

Taken with the 28,000 active licenses in the U.S. between companies and univer-
sities last year to develop useful products, the many more R&D agreements in place
between  companies  and  U.S.  universities  indicates  an  enormously  active  research
enterprise.  Even  companies  espousing  that  U.S.  universities  are  hard  to  deal  with
have active, sizable research partnerships and licensing programs with U.S. univer-
sities.

In summation, policies at universities do not discourage university-industry part-
nerships;  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  plays  a  minimal  role  in  these  types  of  collaborations;
most  universities  would  like  to  establish  ties  with  industry,  but  not  at  the  expense
of  becoming  ‘‘company  shops’’;  and  companies  would  like  to  access  the  expertise  at
the U.S. universities. An example of a common negotiation is that most universities
would  be  happy  to  grant  non-exclusive  licenses  to  companies  in  the  IT  sector,  as
long  as  the  universities  retain  the  ability  to  offer  additional  non-exclusive  licenses.
However, the company’s request for non-exclusive licenses is often accompanied with
the  right  to  sub-license,  no  payments  towards  patent  expenses,  and  the  license  is
irrevocable.  Under  such  circumstances,  if  the  university  were  to  grant  such  a  li-
cense,  it  would  not  be  fulfilling  its  obligation  as  a  steward  of  public  resources  and
further, would be entering into a relationship that was not mutually beneficial.

So I am concerned and deeply puzzled by the continuing profile given to the erro-
neous  viewpoint  that  U.S.  universities  are  hard  to  deal  with,  which  is  contrary  to
the facts and appears strictly based on anecdotal evidence.

Foreign Legislation
Q4. We  hear  that  other  countries  are  copying  Bayh-Dole.  What  are  the  goals  of  the
legislation  in  countries  which  have  passed  similar  laws?  Have  differences  in
goals lead to different metrics for universities in technology transfer and univer-
sity-industry  collaboration?  Are  there  changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  statute  that  are
needed?

A4. The  objective  of  the  countries  that  are  also  emulating  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  to
quite simply duplicate the astounding success of the Bayh-Dole Act in their own ter-
ritories.  The  effect  of  these  new  changes  overseas  is  too  nascent  to  assess  their  im-
pact at this time, especially in achieving the respective objectives established by dif-
ferent  countries.  One  likely  outcome  will  be  more  consistent  treatment  and  collabo-
ration between faculty and students across the globe. As policies enabling collabora-
tion  are  regularized  to  respect  research  teams’  contributions  to  the  public,  univer-
sity-owned  intellectual  property  is  likely  to  be  treated  more  similarly,  as  has  been
achieved  with  intellectual  property  laws.  This  is  likely  to  enable  faster  validation
of  early-stage  university  technology,  and  easier  entry  into  foreign  markets  for  U.S.
companies.

I  do  not  believe  any  changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  are  required  at  this  time  to

address this issue.

In the Public Interest
Q5. Dr.  Lemley,  in  his  testimony,  said  universities  should  take  a  broader  view  of
their  role  in  technology  transfer,  maximizing  the  social  impact  of  technology.
And you included in your testimony the March 2007 white paper, In the Public
Interest:  Nine  Points  to  Consider  in  Licensing  University  Technology.  How
could  technology  transfer  and  university-industry  collaboration  be  conducted  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00122 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

119

better serve the public interest? What might the impact be on industries with dif-
ferent business models?

A5. The  most  effective  technology  transfer  occurs  when  both  parties  understand
each  other’s  needs  and  arrive  at  an  arrangement  that  is  mutually  beneficial.  Nego-
tiations and discussions between the parties should not be confused with legislative,
regulatory  or  policy  issues.  Most  universities  do  take  a  broad  perspective  when  en-
tering in to a research relationship or a licensing transaction and remain cognizant
about  different  industry  clusters  and  respective  business  models.  Some  of  the  chal-
lenges  that  universities  address  during  a  research  negotiation  include  cultural  dif-
ferences  between  the  academic  and  corporate  environments,  ownership  of  univer-
sity-developed  intellectual  property,  licensing  rights  to  such  intellectual  property,
background  rights,  confidentiality  and  publication  rights,  tax  issues,  export  control
(under certain circumstances), and access to research materials.

The  public  interest  is  served  best  when  universities  enter  into  research  relation-
ships  that  are  consistent  with  the  university  mission  of  research,  education  and
public  service.  This  includes  retaining  ownership  of  technology  that  the  university
develops and consistently ensuring that technology is transferred to the commercial
sector  in  many  different  ways—through  education,  training,  source  of  employees,
and  licenses  to  intellectual  property.  Part  of  the  obligations  under  the  Bayh-Dole
Act  requires  universities  to  ensure  that  inventions  are  diligently  developed  for  the
public  benefit.  This  requires  negotiation  of  terms  for  diligent  development  of  feder-
ally-funded  technology  as  well  as  terms  that  permit  universities  to  terminate  li-
censes where appropriate utilization is not taking place.

The  ‘‘Nine  Points’’  document  serves  as  a  guide  for  universities  to  ensure  that  the
public interests are taken into account and that any arrangement between the uni-
versity  and  a  potential  licensee  is  effective  in  the  utilization  of  the  licensed  tech-
nology.  A  number  of  the  points  articulated  in  the  document  are  currently  part  of
policy  and/or  widely  practiced.  This  document  consolidates  these  issues  into  a  suc-
cinct  guide  that  provides  a  perspective  on  why  such  issues  are  important  and  need
to be considered. We hope that the Nine Points white paper helps our industry col-
laborators to understand better the academic environment.

Small Business Perspective
Q6. In  the  hearing  we  discussed  both  university  and  large  corporation  perspectives
on  the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole.  How  do  you  think  the  experience  of  small  business
with  Bayh-Dole  differs  from  that  of  large  corporations?  Please  distinguish  be-
tween experiences you think are unique to individual industries from experiences
you believe are common to all small businesses.

A6. Many of the Nation’s large corporations have significantly reduced their efforts
to  engage  in  fundamental  research  and  development.  The  Economist  recently  ob-
served,  ‘‘Companies  tinker  with  today’s  products  rather  than  pay  researchers  to
think  big  thoughts.’’  Therefore,  a  significant  number  of  large  firms  are  not  them-
selves  as  engaged  in  early-stage  research,  and  therefore  the  Bayh-Dole  technology
transfer process, as are small businesses. The issues related to this move away from
early stage research have very little to do with the nature of university-industry re-
lations  and  more  so  with  the  need  for  these  large  corporations  to  continually  meet
targets  established  by  Wall  Street,  reduction  of  costs  and  overheads,  and  the  intro-
duction of the next version of the product at a faster pace.

Small businesses, in contrast, are a vital part of the Bayh-Dole technology trans-
fer  process.  $42  billion  was  spent  on  R&D  in  U.S.  academic  centers  in  2005.  With
the support of Bayh-Dole, universities transferred this technology primarily to small
businesses.  In  a  majority  of  these  relations,  venture  capital  and  angel  investors  fa-
cilitated  this  process  by  providing  ‘‘risk  capital’’  to  facilitate  this  process.  In  2006
alone,  venture  capitalists  made  over  3,400  investments  and  angel  investors  over
51,000  in  small  businesses,  and  together  investing  over  $50  billion  in  small  busi-
nesses.

In  return,  small  businesses  make  good  stewards  for  the  transferred  technology.
The  Small  Business  Administration  recently  said  that  ‘‘small  firm  innovation  is
twice as closely linked to scientific research as large firm innovation on average, and
so substantially more high-tech or leading edge.’’ More notably, the same SBA study
observed that small businesses are necessary to ‘‘maintain the diversity in our coun-
try’s innovative capacity which is a source of economic strength over the long-term.’’
That is because small business bring new, high-risk technologies to market, they in-
vest  in  new  business  methods  and  models,  and  they  provide  competitive  pressure
on large corporations.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00123 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

120

Therefore,  it  is  my  understanding  that  the  small  business  perspective  on  Bayh-
Dole  is  fundamentally  different  than  a  large  corporation.  Small  businesses  see  the
Bayh-Dole Act, partnerships with universities, and other sources of federal research
as  vital  to  their  future  business  objectives  and  they  act  accordingly.  Large  corpora-
tions, in contrast, invest proportionally less in university collaborations, recognizing
that, in anything, Bayh-Dole may represent a source of competitive threat to an ex-
isting product or technology’s incumbent position.

Best Practices
Q7. During  the  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  a  number  of  best  practices  which
improved  university-industry  collaboration  on  industry  sponsored  research.
Please  summarize,  in  priority  order,  your  top  recommendations  to  improve  col-
laboration on industry sponsored research.

A7. It  is  obvious  that  there  cannot  be  a  single  set  of  ‘‘Best  Practices.’’  In  fact,  the
term  ‘‘Best  Practices’’  implies  a  singular  approach  to  a  situation,  which  as  we  are
discovering is untrue. Even within the industries represented by the other co-panel-
ists (information technologies and chemicals), there is a wide spectrum of what each
seeks in their respective interactions with universities. Each technology and univer-
sity-industry  collaboration  represent  unique  sets  of  circumstances  that  must  be
carefully considered to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship to all parties. This
leads  to  a  negotiation  of  either  a  simple  or  complex  set  of  issues  to  determine  the
respective  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  under  either  a  research  agreement
or an appropriate license agreement. The same issues and drivers that apply to the
case  for  negotiating  license  agreements  can  be  extrapolated  to  negotiations  in  uni-
versity-industry  research  collaborations.  It  is  this  search  for  a  singular  set  of  Best
Practices which often blocks effective collaborations, as the circumstances regarding
early-stage research vary greatly.

The following recommendations to improve collaboration on industry sponsored re-

search would apply equally to companies as well as universities:

1. Understand the culture and needs of the other party.
2. Be  aware  of  federal  and  State  regulations  that  might  play  a  role  in  the  na-

ture of the relationship.

3. Don’t  negotiate  the  Facilities  &  Administrative  rate  associated  with  the

project.

4. Avoid pre-valuing intellectual property that has not yet been created.
5. Negotiate  separately  the  licensing  rights  to  any  background  intellectual

property.

6. Ensure  that  companies  as  well  as  the  faculty  are  aware  of  issues  related  to

conflict of interest.

7. Recognize  that  universities  must  continue  to  maintain  their  academic  prin-
ciples and are not serving as a hired company laboratory when participating
in a research collaboration.

8. Recognize  that  industry  sponsored  research  is  not  a  source  of  ‘‘un-obligated
money,’’  i.e.,  faculty  need  to  be  aware  of  the  expectations  of  the  company
when entering into a research relationship.

9. Operate with an open mind, in good faith and on a reasonable basis to arrive
at  mutually  beneficial  arrangements  on  issues  concerning  intellectual  prop-
erty; publications; and confidentiality.

Federal Government Oversight
Q8. The  Federal  Government  has  an  important  oversight  function  for  Bayh-Dole  to
insure that university patenting serves its intended purpose and is not misused.
What  specific  oversight  do  you  recommend,  including  oversight  by  individual
agencies funding federal research at universities?

A8. One  of  the  initial  purposes  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  was  to  ensure  a  streamlined
and  uniform  federal  policy  across  all  federal  agencies  with  respect  to  inventions
arising  from  federally  funded  research.  Differing  policies  by  individual  agencies
were ineffective, confusing and administratively burdensome. It is extremely impor-
tant for the Federal Government to provide strong and consistent oversight and im-
plementation of the Bayh-Dole Act in order to continue the enormous success of the
Bayh-Dole Act into the next 25 years.

Over  the  years,  a  few  agencies  have  needed  clear  guidance  on  the  proper  imple-
mentation of the Bayh-Dole Act as they have strayed from the standard clause and

established regulations. With the recent passage of the COMPETE Act and expected
elimination  of  Technology  Administration  in  the  Commerce  Department,  it  is  un-
clear  who  will  assume  the  oversight  function  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  Because  much
of the Commerce Department is focused in other areas and Commerce organizations,
such  as  NIST,  is  specifically  designed  to  function  as  a  national  research  laboratory
that  also  funds  research,  a  more  appropriate  placement  would  be  the  Office  of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) which has a broad policy focus to ensure con-
sistent  implementation  across  all  federal  agencies  and  laboratories.  We  encourage
Congress to transfer oversight function to such an office.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Susan B. Butts, Senior Director, External Science and Technology Pro-

grams, The Dow Chemical Company

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Impact of Federal Statutes
Q1. Several  witnesses  commented  in  their  testimony  that  Bayh-Dole  is  only  one  of
several federal statutes that play a role in shaping the interactions and relation-
ships between universities and industry. What are other important statutes, and
how,  if  in  any  way,  do  they  discourage  technology  transfer,  and  industry-spon-
sored university research? Do you see bright-line rules which would help univer-
sities  lower  the  perceived  risk  of  loss  of  non-profit  status  or  federal  research
funding?

A1. In addition to Bayh-Dole there are two other important federal laws and regula-
tions that impact technology-related interactions between universities and industry:
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and the clarifying Revenue Procedure 2007–47),
and  the  cost  principles,  specifically  the  cap  on  university  overhead,  described  in
OMB  Circular  A21  Section  G.8.  Each  of  these  impacts  the  university-industry  rela-
tionship in a different way which I will explain below.

There is a key distinction that I want to make before addressing the specific laws
and  regulations.  This  is  the  distinction  between  situations  in  which  university  in-
ventions  result  directly  from  research  that  is  funded  by  the  government  versus  re-
search  that  is  funded  by  industry.  In  the  former  case  no  company  has  a  vested  in-
terest  in  the  invention  so  the  university  should  take  the  commercialization  path
most  likely  to  get  the  invention  into  use  for  the  public  good.  In  the  latter  case  the
company  that  sponsored  the  research  has  made  an  investment  and  should  have
preference  in  using  patentable  inventions  that  result  from  the  research.  Industry
sponsored university research is different by nature and important to U.S. competi-
tiveness.  In  contract  to  federally  funded  basic  research  in  which  projects  are  pro-
posed by faculty members and competitive grants are awarded based on the funding
agency’s  judgment  of  technical  merit,  industry  funded  research  projects  generally
are framed by the sponsoring company based on its knowledge of the technology and
market and are intended to answer a scientific question or solve a technical problem
that  may  ultimately  lead  to  a  new  or  improved  product  or  manufacturing  process.
In  my  opinion,  the  most  significant  legislative  barrier  to  university-industry  re-
search collaborations is the understandable concern that universities have regarding
their  non-profit  status  and  the  tax-exempt  status  of  their  bonds.  The  Internal  Rev-
enue Code of 1986 sought to prevent companies or individuals from deriving private
benefit from or making private use of non-profit institutions and tax-exempt bonds.
I  am  not  qualified  to  comment  on  the  specific  language  in  the  tax  code  or  how  to
interpret it. However, there is a concern on the part of universities that giving pref-
erence to a industry research sponsor in licensing inventions resulting directly from
the  research  funded  by  the  sponsor  may  constitute  private  use  and,  therefore,  en-
danger  their  non-profit  status  as  well  as  the  tax-exempt  status  of  any  bonds  used
to finance the facility in which the sponsored research was conducted. Revenue Pro-
cedure  2007–47  (which  recently  superseded  Revenue  Procedure  97–14)  creates  a
safe  harbor  regarding  tax  exempt  bonds.  It  sets  forth  conditions  under  which  a  re-
search  agreement  does  not  result  in  private  business  use  under  the  IRS  Code  of
1986.  Section  6.02  in  the  Revenue  Procedure  describes  these  conditions  for  cor-
porate-sponsored research as follows: ‘‘. . .if any license or other use of the resulting
technology  by  the  sponsor  is  permitted  only  on  the  same  terms  as  the  recipient
would  permit  that  use  by  any  unrelated,  non-sponsoring  party  (that  is,  the  sponsor
must  pay  a  competitive  price  for  its  use),  and  the  price  paid  for  that  use  must  be
determined at the time the license or other resulting technology is available for use.
Although  the  recipient  need  not  permit  persons  other  than  the  sponsor  to  use  any
license  or  other  resulting  technology,  the  price  paid  by  the  sponsor  must  be  no  less
than  the  price  that  would  be  paid  by  any  non-sponsoring  party  for  those  same
rights.’’

This safe harbor is problematic for companies that wish to sponsor research. First,
it  provides  for  no  credit  toward  the  cost  of  the  license  to  be  given  to  the  sponsor
for the investment that the sponsor made up-front in the research. This investment
includes  not  only  the  funds  provided  to  pay  for  the  research  project  but  also  other
contributions  such  as  proprietary  information  (technical  or  business)  used  to  frame
the  research  problem,  use  of  company-developed  noncommercial  materials  or  proto-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

123

types,  and  use  of  results  of  related  research  and  testing  performed  by  the  sponsor.
Second, the university alone determines the competitive price or market value of the
license.  It  has  been  our  experience  that  universities  tend  to  overvalue  inventions,
and it is in the interest of the university technology transfer office to make the roy-
alty  as  large  as  possible.  Third,  and  most  problematic  for  many  potential  sponsors,
is  that  they  cannot  have  any  assurances  before  entering  into  the  research  agree-
ment  that  they  will  be  able  to  have  reasonable  access  to  inventions  that  may  occur
nor  that  they  can  prevent  these  inventions  from  being  licensed  to  a  competitor.  It
is very difficult for a potential industry sponsor to justify the business risk involved
in sponsoring research on the terms specified in Revenue Procedure 2007–47.

Since  these  regulations  are  peculiar  to  the  United  States  they  contribute  to  the
pressure  for  potential  industry  sponsors  to  take  their  research  projects  to  foreign
universities. I believe that the barrier to university-industry research collaborations
created  by  the  IRS  Code  and  clarifying  revenue  procedures  could  be  significantly
lowered by amending the tax code and regulations to allow the university to include
licensing terms (such as royalty rates or caps for field-specific licenses) in the spon-
sored  research  agreement  without  incurring  the  private  business  use  penalties  as
long as the research otherwise satisfies the university’s non-profit mission (e.g., the
research results will be published, the research provides an educational opportunity,
etc.). Such a change would not obligate universities to include such terms in indus-
try-sponsored  research  agreements  but  it  would  allow  them  to  do  so  without  jeop-
ardy to their non-profit and tax-exempt status. Such pre-licensing terms would then
be  subject  to  university  policy  and  negotiation  under  appropriate  circumstances.
This would not give an unreasonable private benefit to industry sponsors and would
level the playing field relative to universities in the rest of the world.

The second barrier to technology transfer and industry sponsored research is actu-
ally  an  indirect  barrier  stemming  from  the  cap  on  the  overhead  rate  that  univer-
sities  can  charge  on  their  federally  funded  research  projects.  The  federal  overhead
cap  as  proscribed  in  OMB  Circular  A21  Section  G.8  (facilities  and  administration
(F&A)  costs  are  limited  to  26  percent  of  the  modified  total  direct  costs)  has  been
in  place  for  more  than  a  decade  and  is  insufficient  to  cover  the  actual  F&A  costs
that universities now incur. Since the cap was first imposed universities have been
subject  to  numerous  additional  federal  requirements  relating  to  health  and  safety
as well as homeland security (e.g., tracking foreign students and complying with ex-
port  control  laws).  This  shortfall  in  government  funding  for  real  costs  creates  a
funding  gap  that  universities  have  to  make  up  from  other  sources.  One  source  is
licensing  revenue.  This  leads  many  technology  transfer  offices  to  seek  to  maximize
royalty income even though it may jeopardize the relationship with potential indus-
try licensees and research sponsors. I believe that the basis for the federal overhead
rate cap should be re-evaluated and that F&A charges against research grants and
contracts should reflect reasonable costs for administration, including federally-man-
dated compliance programs.

Impact of State Laws
Q2. Mr.  Pradhan  noted  in  his  testimony  that  since  2005,  19  states  have  launched
initiatives targeting innovation by investing in university R&D—including R&D
initiatives  and  tax  incentives  for  the  private  sector  to  partner  with  universities.
How do State laws shape the university-industry collaboration environment? Do
these  laws  pose  any  additional  barriers,  beyond  those  created  by  some  federal
statutes, for university-industry collaboration? Please explain.

A2. State initiatives generally have a positive but limited impact on the university-
industry  collaboration  environment.  The  impact  is  positive  because  the  incentives
generally  promote  collaborations  but  limited  because  the  incentives  usually  pertain
only to companies which have research and/or manufacturing operations within the
state. The initiatives typically are directed toward creating new technology that will
ultimately  lead  to  new  jobs  in  the  state.  This  is  understandable  since  the  funding
for  these  initiatives  comes  from  the  State’s  tax  payers.  While  these  initiatives  will
foster  more  local  research  collaborations  they  are  unlikely  to  have  a  significant  im-
pact  on  innovation  since  they  fail  to  take  into  account  the  global  character  of  re-
search  and  development.  Large  companies  will  choose  to  work  with  the  best  re-
search partners around the world, not the closest ones and successful new products
will come from the most competitive, market aligned technology.

Foreign Legislation
Q3. We  hear  that  other  countries  are  copying  Bayh-Dole.  What  are  the  goals  of  the
legislation  in  other  countries  which  have  passed  similar  laws?  Have  differences

in  goals  led  to  different  metrics  for  universities  in  technology  transfer  and  uni-
versity-industry  collaboration?  Are  there  changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  statute  that
are needed?

A3. It is true that a number of countries have implemented (e.g., Japan) or are con-
templating (e.g., India) legislation similar to the Bayh-Dole Act. They generally have
the same purpose as Bayh-Dole, namely to facilitate transfer of government funded
university  technology  to  businesses  for  development  and  commercialization  but  the
exact  mode  of  operation  reflects  national  circumstances  and  priorities.  The  U.S.  is
unusual in that the Federal Government was the largest source of research funding
when Bayh-Dole was enacted, and it is still the main source of research funding for
universities.  In  some  other  parts  of  the  world  industry  is  a  more  significant  source
of  funding  for  university  research,  and  the  nature  of  the  relationship  between  uni-
versities and industry is more symbiotic, less competitive. The universities see their
role to be education and research and industry’s role to be employment and innova-
tion. It is still the norm outside the U.S. that universities assign title to subject in-
ventions  (those  arising  from  the  sponsored  research  project)  to  the  sponsor  since  it
is  the  sponsor’s  role  to  develop  and  commercialize  the  inventions.  I  have  not  yet
seen an adverse impact on university-industry research collaborations due to Bayh-
Dole-type  legislation  in  other  countries  since  the  legislation  is  focused  on  transfer
of  government-funded  technology  rather  than  industry  sponsored  research,  and  re-
search  partnerships  with  industry,  especially  large  or  multinational  corporations,
are seen as desirable and prestigious.

I am not aware that other countries have established new or different metrics for
technology  transfer.  The  U.S.  is  still  considered  to  be  the  leader  in  moving  univer-
sity technology out to the marketplace so most countries that enact Bayh-Dole-type
legislation  will  likely  use  the  same  metrics  that  have  been  established  in  the  U.S.,
namely,  number  of  licenses  granted  and  amount  of  licensing  revenue  generated.
This could be counterproductive to university-industry research collaborations since
it focuses attention on licensing activity rather doing research and than getting new
technology to market. In my answer to Question 5 below I have provided some sug-
gestions for more appropriate and meaningful metrics.

I  believe  that  there  are  many  positive  features  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  and  that
minor  changes  could  alleviate  the  barriers  that  it  has  posed  to  university-industry
research  collaborations.  The  Bayh-Dole  Act  was  intended  to  promote  the  licensing
of inventions made with federal funding by universities to businesses for subsequent
development  and  commercialization.  It  recognizes  the  critical  need  for  a  company
to  have  a  secure  position  with  regard  to  the  university’s  intellectual  property  in
order to risk making the large investment needed to develop the invention and bring
it  to  market.  Bayh-Dole  provides  sufficient  flexibility  in  the  various  ownership  and
licensing options to accommodate a wide range of business models and industry sec-
tor needs. These options range from the university retaining title to the patent and
granting  a  royalty-free  nonexclusive  license  (which  is  often  preferred  by  industry
sectors such as information technology) or a royalty bearing exclusive license (which
is  preferred  by  the  pharmaceutical  industry  as  long  as  the  royalty  is  reasonable),
to  actual  assignment  of  ownership  of  the  invention  to  a  company  with  permission
of the federal funding agency. Bayh-Dole does not require universities to patent dis-
coveries  that  can  best  be  used  for  the  public  good  by  putting  them  into  the  public
domain  through  publication  nor  does  it  require  universities  to  charge  the  highest
royalty  that  the  market  will  bear.  Thus,  Bayh-Dole  is  a  sound  piece  of  legislation
that  reasonably  addressed  the  key  problem  at  the  time  of  its  enactment:  that  the
U.S. public saw little benefit from federally funded university inventions because in-
dustry  would  not  invest  in  developing  and  commercializing  inventions  that  were
held  in  the  public  domain.  Bayh-Dole  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  university-in-
dustry relations when taken beyond its intended and stated purpose, namely, when
used  as  a  means  for  universities  to  try  to  generate  the  maximum  licensing  income
which  makes  successful  commercialization  of  inventions  less  likely  and  when  it  is
applied  to  privately  funded  (rather  than  federally  funded)  research  which  discour-
ages  such  private  funding.  The  latter  impact  could  best  be  addressed  by  Congress
clarifying  that  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  (and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  university
there  under)  does  not  apply  when  private  (e.g.,  industry)  funds  pay  for  a  specific
research program. Such a clarification would not obligate universities to change the
way they deal with intellectual property from industry-sponsored research. It would,
however, allow those institutions that value industry partnership to have more flexi-
bility and a wider range of options regarding ownership and licensing of foreground
intellectual  property  and,  thus,  attract  more  research  collaborations  with  industry.

Preference for U.S. Industry Requirement
Q4. Dr. Butts—You commented on the ‘‘Preference for U.S. Industry requirement’’ in
Bayh-Dole  (35  U.S.C.  § 204),  and  say  that  concerns  about  this  restriction  have
resulted  in  recommendations  from  both  government  and  industry  that  this  be
addressed.  How  do  you  think  this  requirement  should  be  changed  and  what
would be the potential impact?

A4. My comment was made specifically in reference to the application of Bayh-Dole
to  direct  government  funding  of  industry  research.  However,  the  same  issues  can
occur  when  federally  funded  university  inventions  are  licensed  to  companies.  The
preference for U.S. industry requirement stipulates that any product embodying the
subject invention will be substantially manufactured in the U.S. This is problematic
to  companies  that  have  global  markets  or  foreign  affiliates  or  subsidiaries.  A  com-
pany  may  not  be  able  to  satisfy  global  demand  at  a  competitive  cost  if  most  manu-
facturing must occur in the U.S. This could be due to a lower cost of raw materials
or  labor  outside  the  U.S.  or  to  a  high  cost  of  shipping  manufactured  products  to
other parts of the world. For example, the extremely high cost of natural gas, a pri-
mary feedstock for petrochemicals in the U.S., makes commodity chemicals produced
in  the  U.S.  very  expensive  relative  to  those  produced  in  other  parts  of  the  world.
I believe that U.S. preference in manufacturing should be removed or made a ne-
gotiable term rather than a requirement. This change would make it more attractive
for  companies  with  foreign  markets  and  operations  to  work  with  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment to develop new technology that could benefit the U.S.

In the Public Interest
Q5. Dr.  Lemley,  in  his  testimony,  said  universities  should  take  a  broader  view  of
their  role  in  technology  transfer,  maximizing  the  social  impact  of  technology.
And Mr. Pradhan included in his testimony the March 2007 white paper, In the
Public  Interest:  Nine  Points  to  Consider  in  Licensing  University  Technology.
How  could  technology  transfer  and  university-industry  collaboration  be  con-
ducted  to  better  serve  the  public  interest?  What  might  the  impact  be  on  indus-
tries with different business models?

A5. I  agree  with  Dr.  Lemley’s  statement  but  I  do  not  believe  that  the  Nine  Points
document provides a reasonable approach for doing this. The Nine Points document
was written by representatives from eleven large U.S. research universities and the
Association  of  American  Medical  Colleges.  As  the  preamble  points  out,  it  reflects
certain shared perspectives that emerged from their brainstorming about university
technology licensing. It has a very strong focus on medical- and life sciences-related
research  and  licensing  of  inventions  to  companies  that  manufacture  pharma-
ceuticals or medical devices. The Nine Points document does not address other areas
of technology, such as the physical sciences or engineering, nor does it include input
from the companies that receive the licenses for university inventions. The perspec-
tive is one-sided and fails to recognize the business needs of the commercial compa-
nies  that  must  take  the  risks  and  make  the  sizable  investments  needed  to  develop
and  commercialize  the  university  invention.  In  contrast,  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  en-
lightened in its recognition that industry must have a reasonable assurance of right
to practice and competitive advantage, which may require including exclusive licens-
ing, in order to make the investment needed to bring a technology to market.

Going back to Dr. Lemley’s comment that universities should take a broader view
of  their  role  in  technology  transfer,  maximizing  the  social  impact  of  technology,  I
believe  that  it  is  important  to  recognize  the  difference  between  transfer  of  existing
technology that resulted from federally funded research on the one hand and indus-
try-sponsored  university  research  which  may  or  may  not  produce  useful  results,  let
alone  patentable  inventions,  on  the  other  hand.  Different  approaches  are  needed  to
encourage  the  two  activities  and  maximize  the  social  impact.  No  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’
approach will work.

In the first case, technology transfer from federally funded research, judicious pat-
enting and licensing of useful inventions that need protection for commercial devel-
opment  is  appropriate.  But  where  does  the  societal  benefit  come  from?  Is  it  from
maximizing  licensing  revenues  for  the  university  or  from  getting  new  products  to
market? Many universities concentrate on the former but the greater benefit to soci-
ety comes from the latter. This suggests that different metrics are needed to support
and promote the most beneficial outcome. It is better to measure inventions in com-
mercial  practice  since  this  reflects  the  real  societal  benefit  rather  than  to  measure
number of licenses or amount of licensing revenue since both can occur without suc-
cessful commercialization of the invention. The down side of measuring the number

126

of inventions in commercial practice is that the time lag between licensing and com-
mercialization may be years or even decades depending on the amount of technology
development required. A more immediate and meaningful metric than number of li-
censes is the percentage of university inventions for which one or more licenses have
been  issued.  A  higher  percentage  would  indicate  that  useful  inventions  have  been
patented and that the licensing terms are reasonable.

In  the  second  case,  industry-sponsored  university  research,  the  societal  benefit
comes  primarily  from  the  opportunities  provided  by  the  research  interaction  on  a
real-world problem between faculty and students and the industry researchers. Such
interactions  can  grow  and  lead  to  other  benefits  such  as  employment  for  graduates
and gifts from the company. The amount of research funding from industry sponsors
is  an  appropriate  and  immediate  metric.  There  is  no  guarantee  that  the  research
effort  will  produce  useful  results  and  a  patentable  invention  is  a  rare  outcome.
Fewer  than  five  percent  of  the  university  research  programs  that  my  company  has
sponsored  have  produced  an  invention  worth  patenting.  This  low  success  rate  is
common  for  early  stage  research.  Data  from  the  Association  of  University  Tech-
nology  Managers  Annual  Licensing  Surveys  shows  that,  over  a  ten  year  period  of
time, member universities reported receiving $200 billion in research funding (from
all  sources)  and  filed  50,000  patent  applications.  This  corresponds  to  a  ratio  of  $4
million of funding to each patent application.

On the other hand, the U.S. realizes considerable benefit when industry builds on
the  foundation  of  research  performed  at  universities.  Two  recent  studies  sponsored
and  published  by  the  Council  for  Chemical  Research  (www.ccrhq.org)  show  the
annualized  research  investment  and  returns  for  the  chemical  sector  in  the  United
States. The Federal Government invests about $1 billion in research in the chemical
sciences at universities and national laboratories and companies in the chemical sec-
tor  invest  an  additional  $5  billion  in  their  own  research  programs.  Together,  these
investments  yield  $40  billion  of  growth  in  GDP  and  $8  billion  in  tax  revenue  for
the Federal Government.

Small Business Perspective
Q6. In  the  hearing  we  discussed  both  university  and  large  corporation  perspectives
on  the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole.  How  do  you  think  the  experience  of  small  business
with  Bayh-Dole  differs  from  that  of  large  corporations?  Please  distinguish  be-
tween experiences that you think are unique to individual industries from experi-
ences that you believe are common to all small businesses.

A6. There are several differences between large and small companies, regardless of
industry sector, that can affect the impact of Bayh-Dole. The first is that small com-
panies  have  fewer  research  assets  (employees,  facilities,  equipment)  and,  therefore,
less  capability  to  perform  all  steps  in  the  process  from  idea  generation  to  develop-
ment  of  a  new  product  ready  for  commercial  manufacturing  and  sales.  This  makes
them more dependent on external research and intellectual property sources, includ-
ing  universities,  than  large  companies  are.  The  second  is  that  small  companies  are
often  less  able  to  support  interactions  with  distant  universities  so  they  are  more
likely  to  work  with  local  universities.  The  third  is  that  small  companies  usually
have fewer existing products to generate income so failure of even one new develop-
ment  effort  could  put  a  small  company  out  of  business.  This,  also,  can  make  them
more  dependent  on  university  partners  for  continuing  research  and  development
since  the  company  cannot  afford  to  walk  away  from  a  line  of  research  in  which  it
has invested heavily. Large companies, by contrast, develop many new product ideas
in  parallel.  Their  existing  product  lines  provide  profit  to  fuel  the  development  of
new  products.  They  can,  and  do,  abandon  product  concepts  that  do  not  meet  tech-
nical or commercial milestones and targets. They cut their losses and redirect their
research  investments.  Successful  new  products  have  to  recover  their  own  develop-
ment costs as well as the costs of the failures. While large companies value collabo-
ration  with  universities  they  usually  have  other  options  for  achieving  their  goals
and can walk away from prospective collaborations that are too risky or do not meet
their  business  needs.  They  can  do  the  work  in-house,  they  can  contract  the  work
out to a private research laboratory, or they can find a capable research partner at
another university somewhere else in the world. The net result is that small compa-
nies  are  more  negatively  impacted  when  universities  are  not  responsive  to  their
needs.  One  complaint  that  I  hear  from  my  colleagues  in  small  companies  is  that
U.S.  universities  take  too  long  to  negotiate  licensing  and  research  agreements  and
hold out for terms that are unfavorable to the company. Although both of these dif-
ficulties are damaging to the company’s business opportunities it may have no other
good alternative.

Best Practices

128

Q7. During  the  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  a  number  of  best  practices  which
improved  university-industry  collaboration  on  industry  sponsored  research.
Please  summarize,  in  priority  order,  your  top  recommendations  to  improve  col-
laboration on industry-sponsored research.

A7. Best practices need to take into account the needs and constraints of both uni-
versities and industry. A recent project sponsored by the Government-University-In-
dustry  Research  Roundtable  (GUIRR)  in  the  National  Academies  brought  together
high  level  representatives  from  a  range  of  industry  sectors,  types  of  universities,
and various federal funding agencies to suggest ways to lower the barriers, particu-
larly those involving intellectual property, to university-industry research collabora-
tions.  The  project  team  produced  a  document  called  Guiding  Principles  for  Univer-
sity-Industry 
http://www.uidp.org/
UIDP¥PUBLICATIONS.html)  which  describes  three  principles  that  should  be  fol-
lowed in order to promote win-win interactions. These principles require looking be-
yond  individual  transactions  toward  the  benefits  of  longer-term  partnerships.  The
three guiding principles are:

Endeavors 

(available 

at 

#1 A  successful  university-industry  collaboration  should  support  the  mission  of
each  partner.  Any  effort  in  conflict  with  the  mission  of  either  partner  will
ultimately fail.

#2 Institutional practices and national resources should focus on fostering long-

term partnerships between universities and industry.

#3 Universities  and  industry  should  focus  on  the  benefits  to  each  party  that
will result from collaborations by streamlining negotiations to ensure timely
conduct of the research and the development of the research findings.

It  is  also  important  to  recognize  the  circumstances  leading  to  each  research  col-
laboration, the nature of the proposed project, and the contributions that each party
makes  to  project.  This  is  difficult  to  do  when  standardized  templates  are  used  for
research  agreements  and  when  negotiations  are  policy  based  rather  than  principle
based.  The  new  University-Industry  Demonstration  Partnership  (www.uidp.org),
which  is  operating  under  the  auspices  of  GUIRR,  is  developing  a  negotiation  and
education tool that will guide prospective partners through set of questions relating
to  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  each  project  in  order  to  identify  reasonable  terms
and conditions for the research agreement. This consideration of circumstances and
contributions is particularly important when it comes to dealing with foreground in-
tellectual property that may result from the industry-sponsored project. If the spon-
sor  is  making  a  large  contribution  (funding  and  other  resources)  or  has  significant
background  intellectual  property  then  the  standard  U.S.  university  research  agree-
ment terms are typically not acceptable to the industry sponsor.

Federal Government Oversight
Q8. The  Federal  Government  had  an  important  oversight  function  for  Bayh-Dole  to
insure that university patenting serves its intended purpose and is not misused.
What  specific  oversight  do  you  recommend,  including  oversight  by  individual
agencies funding federal research at universities?

A8. I believe that a light touch is best in the area of oversight so as not to add un-
necessarily  to  the  administrative  burden  on  universities.  A  constructive  approach
would  be  for  each  agency  to  state  its  intentions  about  how  technology  developed
with its funding should be licensed and used. The NIH has provided such guidance
in the past.

Only  some  of  the  problems  with  university-industry  interactions  are  due  to  gov-
ernment laws or regulation. Other problems stem from university and company poli-
cies or practices and cannot be fixed through legislation or governmental oversight.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Wayne  C.  Johnson,  Vice  President,  Worldwide  University  Relations,

Hewlett-Packard Company

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Impact of Federal Statutes
Q1. Several  witnesses  commented  in  their  testimony  that  Bayh-Dole  is  only  one  of
several federal statutes that play a role in shaping the interactions and relation-
ships between universities and industry. What are other important statutes, and
how,  if  in  any  way,  do  they  discourage  technology  transfer,  and  industry-spon-
sored university research? Do you see bright line rules which would help univer-
sities lower the perceived risk of the loss of non-profit status or federal research
funding?

A1. There  appears  to  be  a  complex  interaction  between  the  Bayh-Dole  legislation,
tax-free  municipal  bonds,  the  IRS  federal  tax  code,  and  perhaps  other  legislation
that leads to differing and uncertain interpretations of what can and can’t be done.
I  call  it  ‘‘a  perfect  storm’’  of  things  that  are  working  against  our  efforts  to  collabo-
rate. This complex confluence of laws, tax-exempt statuses, exemptions, and obliga-
tions,  causes  universities  to  take  a  conservative  approach  and  declare  that  most,  if
not  all,  of  the  industry-sponsored  research,  should  come  under  the  Bayh-Dole  um-
brella.  While  I’m  not  an  expert  in  this  area,  I  believe  that  Susan  Butts  painted  a
pretty  vivid  picture  of  some  of  the  challenges  presented  by  this  in  her  testimony.
Although  there  are  many  challenging  areas,  I  would  like  to  briefly  elaborate  on
three examples to illustrate some of the problems.

Fair-market  value  and  the  inability  to  license  up-front:  One  of  the  major  sticking
points  arises  because  universities  feel  that  they  cannot  determine  (and  hence  li-
cense)  the  fair-market-value  of  a  future  invention  up-front,  essentially  before  the
work  has  begun.  Rather,  they  propose  to  their  industry  partners  who  sponsor  re-
search with them, to provide only an option to negotiate for a license later in time,
once  the  IP  is  created  and  its  fair  market  value  has  been  determined.  This  means
that, in the best case, the industry partners who sponsor various research activities
are  not  assured  access  to  the  inventions  that  they  are  funding.  They  are  relegated
to  having  only  an  option  to  negotiate  later  (sometimes  even  a  time-limited  option)
for  a  technology  license,  which  could  in  fact  be  declined.  In  the  worst  case,  a  com-
pany  could  even  be  prevented  from  using  a  technology  that  they  funded  and  devel-
oped,  while  the  university  shops  it  around  to  competitors,  at  a  later  date,  presum-
ably when the value is higher because the sponsoring companies have invested time
and money building products and services that utilize the technology. Still, an even
worse  situation  occurs  when  patent  aggregators  (‘‘patent  trolls’’)  buy-up  these  li-
censes  and  then  prevent  companies  from  bringing  their  own  products  to  market—
in  effect  holding  them  ‘‘hostage’’  after  significant  investment  has  been  made.  In
these  situations,  Bayh-Dole  is  not  only  having  a  chilling  effect  with  respect  to  uni-
versity-industry collaboration, it is also discouraging investment and partnership in
the very technologies that we desire to bring to market, for public benefit.

Staying within the IRS-allowed safe-harbor: We’ve been told that, in order to pre-
serve  their  tax-exempt  status  and  stay  within  allowable  guidelines  for  tax-exempt
municipal bonds, industry sponsorship of university research must stay below a cer-
tain  threshold.  (sometimes  only  five  percent,  sometimes  only  10  percent  of  a  build-
ing  or  facility  is  allowed  for  private  use.)  That  threshold  limits  industry  participa-
tion, and reduces the amount of sponsored research that the university can perform
in  these  buildings.  This  immediately  puts  joint  collaborations  into  the  positions  de-
scribed  above,  discourages  industry  participation  (other  than  philanthropic),  has  a
chilling effect on collaborative research, and prevents us from architecting the types
of partnered experiences that enrich the faculty, produce well-educated students and
give them a good experience of industry and universities working together.

Intersection of concerns: When we look at this from a higher-level, it doesn’t make
sense in aggregate form, and causes immense frustration to industry. On one hand,
we have tax-exempt bonds which lower the cost of building university buildings and
facilities—a  good  move.  We  want  private  sector  participation,  so  that  the  univer-
sities  don’t  become  islands  unto  themselves,  and  provide  rich,  relevant  experiences
for researchers and students—another desirable outcome. And then we immediately
get  into  an  argument  about  whether  or  not  we  can  work  together  and  do  work  in
a particular lab that sits within a building or facility. I’m wondering if there’s a way

to  clarify  all  this  into  an  ‘‘acceptable  use  policy’’  and  provide  operating  parameters
that foster and encourage a collaborative environment.

Avoiding  contact  and  seeking-out  neutral  territory:  When  an  industry  researcher
literally  ‘‘comes  onto  campus’’  for  the  purpose  of  interacting  and  collaborating  with
their university counterpart, there is a built-in conflict of interest that comes about.
When researchers are hired by companies, they usually assign to the company they
work for the IP rights to works that they create, while employed there. On the uni-
versity  side,  there  are  laws  that  require  universities  to  own  the  resulting  IP  that
is developed in buildings that are built with tax-exempt funds. One of our research-
ers jokingly indicated that whenever he wants to have a technical conversation with
any  of  his  university  colleagues,  he  invites  them  off-campus  to  Starbucks  which,  in
effect,  creates  a  kind  of  neutral  ‘‘de-militarized  zone’’  for  collegial  and  collaborative
discussions to take place. Here again, the collection of laws, practices, and boundary
conditions  we  are  faced  with  make  it  very  difficult  for  universities  and  industry  to
collaborate, which is exactly what me must do in order to ensure a successful future.
To  summarize,  across  the  Nation,  university  technology  transfer  offices  and  will-
ing  industry  partners  struggle  greatly  to  determine  what  they  can  and  can’t  do,  in
the face of this increasingly complex set of laws and obligations at the federal, State,
and  municipal  levels.  Whether  it’s  the  laws  themselves,  the  perception  of  what  is
required, or simply the inability to determine what can work for both sides, is irrele-
vant.  What  is  relevant  is  that  these  types  of  situations  (of  which  I  have  described
only four above) create a bureaucracy that makes it extremely difficult to work with
American universities on research of mutual interest and benefit. What can take as
long  as  two  years  to  never  to  negotiate  in  a  research  agreement  with  an  American
university, is achievable in a matter of days with universities in Russia, China, and
other  countries  (ref:  Stan  Williams  testimony,  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,
Science,  and  Transportation,  Subcommittee  on  Science,  Technology,  and  Space,
Hearing on Nanotechnology, September 17, 2002).

Impact of State Laws
Q2. Mr.  Pradhan  noted  in  his  testimony  that  since  2005,  19  states  have  launched
initiatives targeting innovation by investing in university R&D—including R&D
incentives  and  tax  incentives  for  the  private  sector  to  partner  with  universities.
How do State laws shape the university-industry collaboration environment? Do
these  laws  pose  any  additional  barriers,  beyond  those  created  by  some  federal
statutes, for university-industry collaboration? Please explain.

A2. I  am  not  directly  aware  of  any  State  laws  that  have  been  passed  addressing
these issues. However, I am aware of State funded program initiatives which began
five or six years ago in California. These included the major institute programs that
provided matching funds with the private sector, using an RFP process that picked
the  ‘‘best  of  the  best.’’  HP  has  participated  in  several  of  these  institutes,  including
CITRIS (Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society) and
CNSI  (California  NanoSystems  Institute).  These  types  of  investments  are  exem-
plary,  and  they  are  directly  tied  to  the  states  becoming  more  competitive,  as  well
as  the  U.S.  becoming  more  competitive.  I  think  that  those  ought  to  be  emulated.
Furthermore,  this  work  needs  to  be  a  combination  of  State  and  federal  programs
that will be successful in making us competitive, and one without the other doesn’t
make  sense.  If  we  are  talking  about  laws  around  R&D  incentives,  I  would  be  all
for them.

Foreign Legislation
Q3. We  hear  that  other  countries  are  copying  Bayh-Dole.  What  are  the  goals  of  the
legislation  in  countries  which  have  passed  similar  laws?  Have  differences  in
goals lead to different metrics for universities in technology transfer and univer-
sity-industry  collaboration?  Are  there  changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  statute  that  are
needed?

A3. A  number  of  countries,  such  as  Austria,  Canada,  Denmark,  France,  Germany,
Ireland, and Spain, are considering or have enacted policies with respect to innova-
tion  and  intellectual  property.  While  the  goal  of  Bayh-Dole  was  to  transfer  owner-
ship  for  publicly  funded  inventions  from  the  U.S.  Government  to  universities,  the
goal  of  the  policies  in  these  countries  is  to  change  employment  laws  for  university
professors.  They  are  no  longer  exempt  from  laws  that  give  employers  the  IP  gen-
erated  by  their  employees—this  new  focus  is  on  the  retention  of  IP  ownership  for
the benefit of the universities.

Governments  in  countries  such  as  Germany,  Sweden,  and  Japan  have  initiatives
to  encourage  the  formation  of  technology  licensing  organizations  in  universities.  In
Brazil,  their  law  is  even  stronger—it  requires  (compels)  universities  to  either  form
an  agency  to  deal  with  IP  or  to  use  one  established  by  another  university.  Their
intent  is  to  foster  innovation  and  maintain  R&D  inside  a  productive  environment,
in  order  to  provide  for  Brazil’s  technological  autonomy  and  industrial  development.
Goals  in  other  countries  are  driven  by  the  belief  that  the  U.S.  university  system
has  a  big  impact  on  our  innovation  economy.  They  are  copying  our  policies  without
completely understanding our context. For example, UK universities like Oxford and
Cambridge  are  not  as  well-funded,  so  having  the  universities  own  and  license  IP
does  not  make  sense.  Some  people  like  David  Mowery  of  Stanford  have  postulated
that  uninformed  emulation  of  Bayh-Dole  could  be  counterproductive  in  other  coun-
tries,  because  a  focus  on  licensing  as  the  primary  channel  for  technology  transfer
can have a chilling effect on the other (multiple) channels for moving knowledge and
technology out into society.

Although  many  university  TTOs  in  the  U.S.  use  gross  licensing  revenue  as  a
measure of success, developing countries like Brazil and Mexico are having difficulty
applying this metric. These countries invest less in R&D overall, with much of their
investments typically accomplished through government funding. The lack of private
sector  investment  in  R&D  in  developing  countries  makes  it  much  more  difficult  for
TTOs  in  those  countries  to  derive  revenue  through  the  licensing  of  technology.  In-
stead, Brazil is using as a metric the number of patents and publications generated
by a researcher.

In discussions in Europe that I’ve had two years ago in the Glion colloquium, the
practices  that  are  similar  to  Bayh-Dole  that  have  been  transferred  seem  to  be  im-
pacting the ability to do technology transfer in a negative fashion. Most every com-
pany that attended that consortium (Nestle (USA), DuPont (USA), HP (USA), Hoff-
man-Laroche  (Switzerland),  Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft  (Germany) )  indicated  that
technology transfer had become more complicated as a result of U.S. ‘‘best practices’’
that center around Bayh-Dole. I do not know any specifics of Bayh-Dole being imple-
mented in Russia, India, or China—which have significant interest by the major pri-
vate  sector  area—but  my  work  in  other  countries  leads  me  to  believe  that  this  is
not the case.

In the Public Interest
Q4. Dr.  Lemley,  in  his  testimony,  said  universities  should  take  a  broader  view  of
their  role  in  technology  transfer,  maximizing  the  social  impact  of  technology.
And Mr. Pradhan included in his testimony the March 2007 white paper, In the
Public  Interest:  Nine  Points  to  Consider  in  Licensing  University  Technology.
How  could  technology  transfer  and  university-industry  collaboration  be  con-
ducted  to  better  serve  the  public  interest?  What  might  the  impact  be  on  indus-
tries with different business models?

A4. First, let me address the ‘‘Nine Points to Consider’’ document. As I understand
it,  this  was  a  document  prepared  by  university  vice-provosts  for  research,  research
officers, and licensing directors for university technology transfer offices (TTOs). Its
purpose  was  to  help  TTO  staff  understand  the  cumulative  impact  of  their  actions
over time—such as exclusive licensing, improvements, research tools, etc.—and how
certain types of actions can reduce the university’s future flexibility and freedom to
operate.  If  not  chosen  wisely,  actions  taken  in  the  present  by  TTOs  could,  in  some
cases,  paint  the  universities  into  a  corner  which  would  be  hard  to  remediate  later.
The  ‘‘Nine  Points’’  document  was  not  put  forward  as,  nor  was  it  intended  to  be,
a  solution  to  the  challenges  in  negotiating  university-industry  collaborations,  yet
others have offered it as such.

Because  the  ‘‘Nine  Points’’  document  is  one  of  the  few  tangible  expressions  of  de-
tailed  parameters  having  to  do  with  technology  licensing,  it  is  being  broadly  used
in ways beyond what was intended. I would like to point out that there are several
examples of contract terms and parameters in this document (as it presently stands)
that  are  simply  unacceptable  to  industry  and  could  not  be  used  as  a  basis  for  suc-
cessful negotiation, neither in IP-focused cases, nor in collaborative exchanges.

What  is  needed,  from  a  collaborative  viewpoint,  is  an  equivalent  set  of  guide-
lines—let’s call it ‘‘Points to consider in fostering collaboration and knowledge trans-
fer  via  multiple  parallel  paths.’’  There  is  a  whole  spectrum  of  ways  that  knowledge
and information moves outward from universities; licensing is just one of them. Con-
sider  the  impact  of  publishing,  open  source  development,  participation  in  con-
ferences,  participation  in  professional  societies,  U–I  collaborations,  consulting.  For
decades,  it  has  been  widely  recognized  that  the  best  method  of  knowledge  transfer
is  students—highly  educated,  well  prepared  students  that  move  to  industry  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:34 Jan 19, 2008 Jkt 036592 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\T&I07\071707\36592 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

132

other  career  destinations  and  utilize  their  knowledge  for  societal  benefit.  And  this
is in keeping with the core mission and primary focus of the university—to produce
highly educated students.

What we are experiencing now is a shift in focus away from knowledge and people
(students) to licenses and things (‘‘technology that is presumably sitting on a shelf’’)
for which it is possible to maximize revenue through technology transfer offices. Our
experience is that the goal of maximizing revenue is getting in the way of increasing
the transfer, dissemination, and utilization of knowledge and information (for public
benefit),  and  at  the  same  time,  taking  us  away  from  the  core  mission  and  purpose
of education.

In  considering  the  original  question,  ‘‘How  could  technology  transfer  and  univer-
sity-industry collaboration be conducted to better serve the public interest?’’ I would
submit  that  the  metrics  are  currently  inappropriate  and  misguided.  This  has  been
written  about  by  several  authors  in  various  papers.  They  observe  that  university
TTOs are acting as if driven by a patent mentality, and a maximization of revenue
objective.  Yet  what  is  needed  is  a  flow  of  knowledge  and  ideas  out  to  the  public
through  multiple  avenues  (again,  technology  licensing  is  only  one),  and  an  under-
standing of the benefits of working collaboratively at multiple levels across the uni-
versity-industry space.

Even in the case of technology licensing and ‘‘deals,’’ the current metrics are still
misguided.  As  has  been  pointed  out  in  the  literature,  it  would  better  serve  our  col-
lective  interests  if  TTOs  were  to  maximize  the  number  of  deals  that  they  do  (with
a  goal  of  maximizing  the  amount  of  technology  transfer),  rather  than  maximizing
the  revenue  that  can  be  gotten  from  the  smallest  number  of  deals.  The  dynamics
that  support  revenue  maximization  (as  opposed  to  transfer  maximization)  force  the
TTOs  into  the  role  of  ‘‘gate-keepers’’  that  slow  the  flow  of  knowledge  and  informa-
tion,  which  is  again,  directly  in  conflict  with  what  Bayh-Dole  was  intended  to
achieve.  One  research  vice  provost  (whom  I  have  a  lot  of  respect  for)  tells  his  staff
repeatedly that, ‘‘the worst deal that we can make is ‘no deal,’ ’’ thereby emphasizing
the  whole  picture  of  multiple  contributions  to  society,  and  a  focus  away  from  rev-
enue maximization of a single deal.

From  my  point-of-view,  Dr.  Lemley’s  point  is  extremely  well  taken.  There  is  a
much  broader  role  that  universities  can  play.  The  revenue  objective  is  taking  us
away  from  solid  and  productive  university-industry  relationships  and  interactions,
away  from  knowledge  transfer  and  collaboration,  and  is  putting  us  on  a  dangerous
path of ‘‘go-it-alone’’—which is, again, the opposite of what Bayh-Dole was trying to
achieve.  In  terms  of  licensing,  the  lure  of  revenue  maximization  is  amplifying  the
‘‘home  run’’  patent  mentality,  which  mostly  applies  to  the  pharma  and  bio-tech  in-
dustries.  Studies  have  shown  that,  if  one  removes  the  university  licensing  revenue
received  from  pharma  and  bio-tech  ‘‘home  run’’  patents,  most  university  TTOs  do
not  even  recover  enough  revenue  to  cover  their  own  administrative  costs.  So,  in  ef-
fect, what is happening is the dream of ‘‘home run patents’’ and revenue maximiza-
tion  is  being  chased  by  a  bureaucracy  that  slows  the  transfer  of  knowledge  and  in-
formation,  and  erodes  industry  relationships  and  partnerships,  that  should  be  the
cornerstone  of  our  society.  Further,  it  forces  a  ‘‘one-size  fits  all’’  treatment  of  intel-
lectual property using the pharma and bio-tech models across all university-industry
negotiations.  On  the  industry-side,  it  feels  like  we  are  trading  the  bio-tech  and
pharma  industry  for  all  others,  and  ignoring  information  technology,  information
sciences, software, new media, clean energy, etc., who do not rely on the ‘‘home-run’’
patent mentality.

Small Business Perspective
Q5. In  the  hearing  we  discussed  both  university  and  large  corporation  perspectives
on  the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole.  How  do  you  think  the  experience  of  small  business
with  Bayh-Dole  differs  from  that  of  large  corporations?  Please  distinguish  be-
tween experiences you think are unique to individual industries from experiences
you believe are common to all small businesses.

A5. From a background perspective, intellectual property plays a key role for entre-
preneurial businesses, particularly in their early stages of development where start-
up  capital  is  being  sought.  Venture  capitalists  and  other  funding  sources  feel  more
confident  about  investing  in  a  company  which  has  a  defensible  IP  that  can  con-
tribute  to  a  distinctive  advantage,  than  they  do  in  funding  companies  with  com-
petencies that are un-established, unproven, and perhaps easily duplicated. Even if
their  patents  are  not  yet  granted,  but  still  applied  for,  intellectual  property  owner-
ship gives them an added measure of credibility when seeking financing.

Since most of my career has been doing work involving larger companies and uni-

versities, I don’t have the additional perspective to comment beyond this.

Best Practices
Q6. During  the  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  a  number  of  best  practices  which
improved  university-industry  collaboration  on  industry  sponsored  research.
Please  summarize,  in  priority  order,  your  top  recommendations  to  improve  col-
laboration on industry sponsored research.

A6. From  my  experience,  let  me  first  say  that  the  overarching  theme  of  best  prac-
tice is to understand that it is a long-term strategic multilevel partnership that de-
velops the best results. I’ve been working in the university-industry space for many
years,  and  have  found  that  companies  and  universities  need  to  understand  this  as
a basis for everything they do.

Second,  universities  and  companies  need  to  set  an  appropriate  high-level  context
and value the collaborative relationship more than they do any single activity or op-
portunity,  utilize  their  interpersonal  networks  to  advantage,  and  value  research
support  as  highly  as  license  revenue.  These  higher-level  philosophies  or  operating
parameters give valuable guidance to individuals and departments acting on behalf
of  the  institution  or  company,  in  this  space.  We  also  need  to  recognize  that  there
are  multiple  paths  for  universities  to  get  their  knowledge  and  information  trans-
ferred for societal impact.

Third,  I  would  recommend  that  we  follow  the  Sponsored  Research  Interaction
Process (SRIP) which was developed under BASIC (the Bay Area Science and Inno-
vation Consortium). While the typical negotiation begins at a difficult entry point—
emphasizing  draft  agreements  which  quickly  lead  to  polarized  positions,  the  SRIP
model starts with the leadership of each organization committing to the relationship
and  the  negotiating  team  focusing  on  the  collaborative  intent  and  the  building  of
a shared understanding. Our experience in using this process yields a 10X improve-
ment  in  negotiating  a  collaboration  agreement—from  20+  months  to  two  months!
The essence of the SRIP model is:

• Build a team. Convene teams with the appropriate members on both the uni-
versity  and  industry  sides.  Each  team  member  should  have  a  clearly  identi-
fied  role.  Have  a  lead  person  in  each  team  accountable  for  getting  to  timely
agreement.  Have  the  principals  and  negotiators  meet  face-to-face  to  build  re-
lationships and enhance rapport.
• Set  expectations.  It  should  be  possible  to  get  to  agreement  with  1–2  face-to-
face  meetings,  a  couple  of  phone  calls,  and  a  final  closing  meeting,  all  in  a
few days, spread over 3–4 weeks. Instill in the team a sense of urgency. This
activity  shouldn’t  drag  on,  nor  should  it  be  overly  burdensome  or  time-con-
suming.
• Work  from  the  big  picture  (model).  Set  goals  at  the  right  level  to  gain  agree-
ment,  and  establish  metrics  (such  as  the  total  amount  of  research  funding)
that reflect relationship-level thinking and not just transaction-level thinking.
• Utilize a process that the team commits to use (secure ‘‘buy-in’’). Secure strong
sponsorship  and  commitment  to  making  it  work.  Educate  all  team  members
about the process that they will use to communicate.
• Work  the  process  creatively.  All  concerned  must  be  prepared  to  offer  creative
• Have  an  escalation  path.  When  stuck,  leaders  must  elevate  reasoning  to  a
higher-level  of  intent,  focusing  on  the  broader  collaborative  relationship  and
how the planned research work will benefit both industry and university.

insights for working through tough problems and navigating impasses.

Federal Government Oversight
Q7. The  Federal  Government  has  an  important  oversight  function  for  Bayh-Dole  to
insure that university patenting serves its intended purpose and is not misused.
What  specific  oversight  do  you  recommend,  including  oversight  by  individual
agencies funding federal research at universities?

A7. I  think  that  we  ought  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  whether  the  goals  of
the  legislation  are  being  met,  from  a  technology  transfer  point  of  view.  Two  key
goals of the Bayh-Dole legislation are to promote the utilization of inventions arising
from  federally  supported  R&D,  and  to  promote  collaboration.  Is  it  really  accom-
plishing  these  goals?  In  aggregate,  or  only  in  specific  situations?  How  would  we
know?

While  we’ve  not  been  recommending  changes  to  the  legislation,  many  times
throughout my testimony, as well as in the testimony of others, we’ve indicated that
the exact opposite of what was intended to happen, is what has happened. This leg-
islation  didn’t  get  put  into  place  yesterday.  It’s  27  years  old,  and  we’ve  had  plenty

of time to figure it out. The results we have now are the results we’re likely to have
in  the  future.  If  it  were  up  to  me,  I  would  focus  on  developing  metrics  to  ensure
that  the  intent  of  the  legislation  is  being  met.  In  industry,  we  understand  the  im-
portance  of  having  a  closed-loop  mandate  for  organizations—including  a  goal/objec-
tive statement, a set of operational parameters, and a set of metrics to ensure that
things stay on track.

In  the  world  arena,  knowledge  exchange  and  collaborative  engagements/partner-
ships  are  now  the  norm.  They  are  supplanting  technology  transfer  as  the  contem-
porary  operating  model  for  accomplishing  joint  work.  Technology-transfer,  and  the
operating  model  that  lies  beneath  it,  made  sense  30  years  ago.  It  is  now  obsolete
in the IT, information sciences, and software industries. The properties of this oper-
ating  model  are  such  that  it  yields  results  that  are  poorly  targeted,  takes  too  long
in  development,  misses  out  on  important  opportunity  windows,  encourages  go-it-
alone approaches, engages single (vs. multiple stakeholders), does not have a collec-
tive  amplifying  effect  on  innovation,  nor  does  it  support  the  development  of  broad
ecosystems of value delivery. Our industry has moved beyond the technology-trans-
fer  paradigm,  more  into  the  collaborative  arena  with  multiple  industry  partners
working with multiple universities, for both individual and collective benefit.

We  know,  anecdotally,  that  Bayh-Dole  has  broadly  hurt  collaboration,  and  in  the
best  of  cases,  at  least  made  it  more  difficult.  We  also  know  that,  in  many  cases,
Bayh-Dole  has  brought  to  the  forefront  a  university  focus  on  licensing,  at  the  ex-
pense  of  the  other  forms  of  knowledge  transfer  and  relationship  development,  not
the  least  of  which  is  the  education  of  students.  Within  this  licensing  focus,  we’ve
seen  that  universities  have  been  focused  on  maximizing  revenue  from  the  few  pat-
ents that have high potential value (the ‘‘home-run’’ patents, typical of the pharma/
bio-tech industry), and not the aggregate portfolio of technology that could be trans-
ferred and gotten ‘‘out-there’’ for public benefit. They’ve been optimizing for a return
of  total  revenue,  and  not  maximizing  the  total  transfer  of  a  portfolio  of  technology
(which, again, was what was intended by the legislation.)

The  goals  of  Bayh-Dole  were  right  for  the  time.  If  we  had  also  created  the  com-
panion  metrics  when  the  legislation  was  written,  I  believe  that  we  would  have
avoided  many  of  the  traps  and  pitfalls,  and  would  now  know  with  certainty  where
we are, and how much we’ve fallen short of the original intent.

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Impact of Federal Statutes
Q1. Several  witnesses  commented  in  their  testimony  that  Bayh-Dole  is  only  one  of
several federal statutes that play a role in shaping the interactions and relation-
ships between universities and industry. What are other important statutes, and
how,  if  in  any  way,  do  they  discourage  technology  transfer,  and  industry-spon-
sored university research? Do you see bright line rules which would help univer-
sities lower the perceived risk of the loss of non-profit status or federal research
funding?

A1. I do not know of other federal statutes that discourage technology transfer and
industry-sponsored  university  research.  One  set  of  federal  statutes  and  regulations
that  bear  on  this  issue  involve  government  procurement,  and  particularly  Depart-
ment  of  Defense  procurement.  Because  the  DOD  often  develops  inventions  in  the
course  of  designing  specifications  for  private  companies  to  supply,  DOD  regulations
governing IP ownership and technology transfer are critically important.

Impact of State Laws
Q2. Mr.  Pradhan  noted  in  his  testimony  that  since  2005,  19  states  have  launched
initiatives targeting innovation by investing in university R&D—including R&D
incentives  and  tax  incentives  for  the  private  sector  to  partner  with  universities.
How do State laws shape the university-industry collaboration environment? Do
these  laws  pose  any  additional  barriers,  beyond  those  created  by  some  federal
statutes, for university-industry collaboration? Please explain.

A2. State laws generally are aimed at encouraging, not discouraging, university re-
search and development and university-private sector partnerships. But they can oc-
casionally raise issues. For example, the State of California has funded stem-cell re-
search by public initiative. Part of that initiative requires that inventions developed
through  State  funding  be  licensed  in  a  way  that  benefits  the  State  of  California.
While  this  makes  sense  given  the  State  funding,  it  may  impose  barriers  to  broad
licensing of the results of that research to private companies outside California, de-
pending on how the law is interpreted.

Foreign Legislation
Q3. We  hear  that  other  countries  are  copying  Bayh-Dole.  What  are  the  goals  of  the
legislation  in  countries  which  have  passed  similar  laws?  Have  differences  in
goals lead to different metrics for universities in technology transfer and univer-
sity-industry  collaboration?  Are  there  changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  statute  that  are
needed?

A3. Foreign  countries  are  generally  seeking  direct  foreign  investment  in  research
and development. While some foreign countries that pass Bayh-Dole type legislation
may  be  particularly  interested  in  the  results  of  their  own  funding,  my  impression
is  that  more  commonly  they  are  seeking  to  eliminate  any  perceived  barriers  that
prevent  multinational  companies  from  investing  in  university  research  in  their
countries and licensing the resulting innovations on an exclusive basis.

Preference for U.S. Industry Requirement
Q4. You recommend in your testimony removing provisions in Bayh-Dole which dis-
criminate against licensing university inventions to foreign businesses (35 U.S.C.
§204). Would you please explain your recommendation and its potential impact?
A4. I  am  a  believer  in  free  trade,  particularly  in  IP.  I  think  that  in  the  modern,
globalized world, there is no reason to prevent universities from licensing their tech-
nology  to  the  company  or  companies  best  positioned  to  maximize  its  impact  in  the
world.  Sometimes—usually—those  companies  will  be  local,  but  not  always.  If  no
good local alternatives are available, universities should not have to choose an infe-
rior licensing deal simply to encourage local manufacture.

It  is  possible  that  eliminating  section  204  will  encourage  some  licensing  to  move
offshore,  but  I  think  any  such  effect  is  likely  to  be  minimal.  And  even  if  that  hap-

136

pens,  it  will  be  offset  by  the  benefits  to  American  consumers  of  having  university
technology licensed more efficiently, and by the possibility that American companies
can license technology from foreign universities.

In the Public Interest
Q5. You  recommended  in  your  testimony  that  universities  should  take  a  broader
view  of  their  role  in  technology  transfer,  maximizing  the  social  impact  of  tech-
nology.  And  Mr.  Pradhan  included  in  his  testimony  the  March  2007  white
paper, ‘‘In the Public Interest: Nine Points to Consider in Licensing University
Technology.’’  How  could  technology  transfer  and  university-industry  collabora-
tion  be  conducted  to  better  serve  the  public  interest?  What  might  the  impact  be
on industries with different business models?

A5. I  believe  the  nine  points  Mr.  Pradhan  offered  are  a  sensible  place  for  univer-
sities  to  start  in  achieving  what  I  believe  must  be  their  overarching  goal:  to  maxi-
mize the beneficial social impact of new technology. Taking that goal seriously will,
I  suspect,  mean  that  licensing  will  look  different  in  different  industries.  In  par-
ticular, I think it likely that exclusive licenses will make sense primarily in the bio-
medical  and  nanotechnology  industries,  which  require  a  lot  of  time  and  effort  to
turn  an  invention  into  a  marketable  product  acceptable  to  regulators.  By  contrast,
I  think  exclusive  licenses  in  the  information  technology  industries  would  be  quite
rare under this approach.

Small Business Perspective
Q6. In  the  hearing  we  discussed  both  university  and  large  corporation  perspectives
on  the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole.  How  do  you  think  the  experience  of  small  business
with  Bayh-Dole  differs  from  that  of  large  corporations?  Please  distinguish  be-
tween experiences you think are unique to individual industries from experiences
you believe are common to all small businesses.

A6. I  believe  the  effect  on  small  businesses  is  bound  up  with  the  industry-specific
nature  of  the  best  practices  I  just  noted.  Small  businesses  that  are  started  around
a  university  invention  usually  want  exclusive  licenses  to  develop  and  practice  that
invention. Under the approach I outlined, this will likely be common in some indus-
tries but not others. On the other hand, an exclusive license benefits only one busi-
ness, large or small, and disadvantages all others. Small businesses who do not need
to  invest  large  sums  in  making  an  invention  marketable  will  benefit  from  a  non-
exclusive  license,  because  they  will  all  be  free  to  compete  to  make  the  invention.

Best Practices
Q7. During  the  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  a  number  of  best  practices  which
improved  university-industry  collaboration  on  industry  sponsored  research.
Please summarize, priority order, your top recommendations to improve collabo-
ration on industry sponsored research.

A7. My  top  three  priorities  for  university  best  practices  are:  (1)  adopt  as  a  goal
maximizing the social impact of the licensed technology, not short-term revenue. (2)
structure  and  reward  university  licensing  offices  as  part  of  the  broader  mission  of
technology  transfer,  and  not  on  their  short-term  bottom  line.  (3)  avoid  exclusive  li-
censes unless necessary to bring the technology to market, and if exclusive licenses
are necessary, set benchmarks and required practices to ensure that the licensee is
effectively commercializing the technology and not merely interfering with the abil-
ity of others to do so.

Federal Government Oversight
Q8. The  Federal  Government  has  an  important  oversight  function  for  Bayh-Dole  to
insure that university patenting serves its intended purpose and is not misused.
What  specific  oversight  do  you  recommend,  including  oversight  by  individual
agencies funding federal research at universities?

A8. I believe granting agencies should require reports on patents produced as a re-
sult  of  their  grants,  to  whom  those  patents  were  licensed,  and  under  what  condi-
tions.  They  should  also  require  that  those  licenses  be  made  public.  They  should
monitor  progress  under  the  license  periodically,  and  should  have  a  mechanism  to
field  and  evaluate  complaints  about  the  licensee  if  the  licensee  is  interfering  with
the implementation of the licensed technology. If necessary, agencies should be will-

or compel broader licensing on reasonable terms.

Questions submitted by Chairman David Wu

Impact of Federal Statutes
Q1. Several  witnesses  commented  in  their  testimony  that  Bayh-Dole  is  only  one  of
several federal statutes that play a role in shaping the interactions and relation-
ships between universities and industry. What are other important statutes, and
how,  if  in  any  way,  do  they  discourage  technology  transfer,  and  industry  spon-
sored  research?  Do  you  see  any  bright-line  rules  which  would  help  universities
lower the perceived risk of the loss of non-profit status or federal funding?

A1. The  relationship  between  universities  and  industry  is  broad  and  multifaceted.
Interactions  range  from  universities  providing  a  highly  skilled  workforce  for  U.S.
companies  to  private  industry  support  for  the  mission  of  universities  through  phi-
lanthropy.  University  research  is  just  one  part  of  that  relationship  and  even  that
is  highly  variable  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  research  problem.  Some  research
problems  center  on  fundamental  inquiry,  some  build  on  background  intellectual
property developed by one or both parties over an extended period of time, and some
are  simply  short-term  tactical  problems—just  to  name  a  few.  In  many  cases  a  pro-
gram of research will proceed over a long period of time and be funded by the U.S.
Government, private industry, and non-profit organizations that fund research. The
Council on Governmental Relations and the National Council of University Research
Administrators  have  both  published  documents  identifying  the  many  federal  stat-
utes  that  control  university  research  in  all  these  circumstances.  I  will  not  attempt
to  re-address  those  here  but  will  mention  the  area  of  law  and  regulation  affecting
university  technology  transfer  that  is  most  often  cited  after  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  the
tax code.

I am not an expert in tax law. It is my understanding that the general framework
for  the  treatment  of  tax  exempt  organizations  that  perform  research  and  transfer
technology  is  that  such  institutions,  since  they  benefit  from  public  investment  by
virtue of their tax exempt status, must take steps to ensure that the public benefits
from  the  results  of  the  research,  including  patents,  by  making  them  available  on
a non-discriminatory basis. When universities take title to intellectual property that
results  from  research,  regardless  of  the  sources  of  funds  for  that  research,  and  li-
censes  it  to  an  entity  that  has  or  can  attract  the  resources  necessary  to  develop  it
into a new product, good or service, it seems to me it meets that test of public ben-
efit.  Exclusive  licensing  may  be  necessary  for  early  stage  technologies  that  require
significant investment and require long lead times to ensure that investors have in-
centive to develop the technology. Non-exclusive licensing is a valid approach in in-
dustries,  such  as  some  sectors  of  information  technology,  where  cross-licensing  is
common  and  the  life  of  technologies  is  relatively  short.  The  ability  of  universities
to accept funds from industry and once the research is conducted license technology
to  industry  on  reasonable  market-based  terms  does  not  seem  to  be  impeded  by  the
tax code.

The  roles  and  importance  of  the  most  common  modes  of  technology  transfer,  the
education  of  students  and  the  publication  of  research  findings,  should  not  be  over-
looked or underestimated. Students that graduate from the leading research institu-
tions  in  the  United  States  carry  with  them  to  their  eventual  employers  in  private
industry  a  wealth  of  know-how  gained  from  their  participation  in  research.  Simi-
larly,  the  robust  body  of  peer-reviewed  literature  in  each  discipline  is  a  primary
mode  of  dissemination  of  research  results  both  to  industry  and  the  public.  The  tax
code supports these important modes of technology transfer. Two of the purposes for
which  university  research  may  be  considered  to  be  in  the  public  interest  are  the
education of university students and undertaking research that will be published in
treatises, theses, or other forms available to the public. Taken together with a third
purpose,  discovering  a  cure  for  a  disease,  the  tax  code  supports  the  mission  of  re-
search universities in serving the public including all sectors of private industry.

Finally,  the  tax  code  anticipates  that  research  will  be  undertaken  by  tax  exempt
organizations such as universities to aid a community or geographic area in attract-
ing  or  retaining  industry.  This  is  consistent  with  the  mission  of  research  and  tech-
nology  transfer  by  universities.  The  existence  of  major  research  universities  is  an
often-cited  reason  for  the  success  of  localities  where  high-tech  industries  have  blos-

somed. This is likely to result from a combination of the availability of exciting new
technologies  based  on  federally-funded  research  and  accessible  to  industry  because
of  Bayh-Dole,  a  highly  educated  workforce,  and  closely  available  research  facilities
to  address  industry’s  questions  through  sponsored  research  and  collaboration  with
top scientists and engineers.

Impact of State Laws
Q2. Mr.  Pradhan  noted  in  his  testimony  that  since  2005,  19  states  have  launched
initiatives targeting innovation by investing in university R&D—including R&D
incentives  and  tax  incentives  for  the  private  sector  to  partner  with  universities.
How do State laws shape the university-industry collaboration environment? Do
these  laws  pose  any  additional  barriers,  beyond  those  created  by  some  federal
statutes, for university-industry collaboration? Please explain.

A2. States have a legitimate interest in promoting strong interactions between uni-
versities  and  private  industry  for  continued  economic  development  including  cre-
ation  of  new  ventures  and  building  new  or  existing  industries.  As  noted  above,
strong research universities are correlated with development of high tech industries.
For  example,  in  my  home  state  the  Georgia  Research  Alliance  (GRA),  a  public-pri-
vate collaboration between the State of Georgia and private industry, has for a num-
ber  of  years  fostered  innovation  through  support  for  research  in  Georgia’s  univer-
sities.  GRA  achieves  its  goals  through  strategic  investments  at  the  state’s  leading
research universities in eminent scholars, research laboratories and equipment, na-
tional  centers  for  research  and  innovation  and  technology  transfer  programs.  The
support through endowed chairs and funds for equipment has been invaluable in ex-
panding  the  research  capabilities  of  institutions  in  Georgia.  GRA  supports  tech-
nology transfer by matching research funds for translational research. Translational
research  occurs  at  the  critical  stage  of  technology  development  between  the  labora-
tory and the working prototype or demonstration of market feasibility.

State  governments  provide  significant  support  for  State  universities.  Some  State
universities are State agencies or units of State government and subject to the stat-
utes  and  regulations  that  apply  to  such  agencies.  State  governments  may  seek  to
ensure  that  tax-payers  in  the  state  benefit  from  the  State’s  investment  in  research
infrastructure.  Benefits  to  tax-payers  may  take  the  form  of  economic  development,
new  products  or  services,  increased  research  revenue  that  ultimately  furthers  the
university’s  public  benefit  mission,  or  revenue  from  intellectual  property  that  can
be  reinvested  in  research  and  education  at  the  university  where  the  discovery  was
made.  The  treatment  of  intellectual  property  contemplated  by  Bayh-Dole  addresses
the needs of State government to ensure public benefit and reinvestment in research
and education.

University  requirements  based  on  State  laws  that  lead  to  protracted  negotiation
of research agreements with industry are not generally laws that deal with intellec-
tual  property  matters.  Rather,  those  cited  by  industry  as  impediments  are  most
often  issues  surrounding  indemnification  provisions,  dispute  resolution,  or  open
records.  When  a  State  agency  is  one  of  the  parties  to  an  agreement,  it  is  probably
reasonable for laws that apply to State contracts to be accommodated.

Foreign Legislation
Q3. We  hear  that  other  countries  are  copying  Bayh-Dole.  What  are  the  goals  of  the
legislation  in  countries  which  have  passed  similar  laws?  Have  differences  in
goals lead to different metrics for universities in technology transfer and univer-
sity-industry  collaboration?  Are  there  changes  to  the  Bayh-Dole  statute  that  are
needed?

A3. I do not have detailed knowledge of the specific foreign initiatives or legislation
referred to in this question so it would be inappropriate for me to speculate beyond
my experience in this area. However, I have also noted that in visits to universities
in  other  countries,  specifically  Japan,  Korea,  and  Switzerland,  that  the  American
model  of  university-based  intellectual  property  creation,  protection,  and  licensing  is
being held forward as a model to be duplicated.

In the Public Interest
Q4. Dr.  Lemley,  in  his  testimony,  said  universities  should  take  a  broader  view  of
their  role  in  technology  transfer,  maximizing  the  social  impact  of  technology.
And Mr. Pradhan included in his testimony the March 2007 white paper, In the
Public  Interest:  Nine  Points  to  Consider  in  Licensing  University  Technology.

ducted  to  better  serve  the  public  interest?  What  might  the  impact  be  on  indus-
tries with different business models?

A4. I  agree  that  universities  should  be  mindful  of  the  public  interest  in  their  re-
search,  education  and  technology  transfer  activities.  In  the  Public  Interest:  Nine
Points  to  Consider  in  Licensing  University  Technology  enumerates  the  tenets  of  li-
censing in the public interest as articulated by the signatory universities. However,
licensing  generally  involves  patented  intellectual  property  or  software  protected  by
copyright.  Technology  transfer  also  takes  place  at  universities  in  many  other  ways
including  the  education  of  undergraduate  and  graduate  students,  publication  of  re-
search  findings  in  peer-reviewed  publications,  continuing  education  programs,
symposia  and  seminars.  Balancing  these  modes  of  dissemination  of  new  knowledge
is critical to maximizing the social impact of research. The following practices in the
conduct of university-industry collaborations particularly tend to serve the public in-
terest:

• Contractual assurance that researchers are able to freely publish research re-
sults. Allowances for brief delay so that patent protection can be obtained do
not impede this practice.

ticipation in symposia and seminars.

• Supporting graduate student research as part of the collaboration.
• Encouraging the exchange of university and industry scientists and their par-
• Encouraging  a  number  of  companies  to  support  research  in  university  re-
search  centers  focused  on  problems  in  a  particular  industry  or  technology
area  such  as  the  Engineering  Research  Centers  funded  by  the  National
Science  Foundation  which  requires  that  universities  recruit  industry  mem-
bers for the center.

Patented  intellectual  property  and  copyright  software  are  often  best  brought  into
public  use  by  commercial  entities  that  develop  technology  and  the  market  for  it.
There  are  numerous  examples  of  new  drugs,  medical  devices,  telecommunications
technologies,  and  information  technologies  that  resulted  from  university  research
that  have  changed  or  even  saved  the  lives  of  Americans.  Licensing  of  such  tech-
nology  serves  the  public  interest.  Milestone  and  diligence  provision  in  the  license
ensure  that  the  companies  that  license  such  technologies  take  the  steps  necessary
to  bring  the  technology  to  the  marketplace.  Common  license  terms  further  protect
the  public  interest.  By  reserving  the  right  to  practice  such  technology  in  research
and permit other universities and non-profits to do so, universities ensure that fur-
ther development can take place. Granting exclusive rights to a defined field of use
in  a  license  encourages  development  and  application  of  a  transformational  tech-
nology in more than one industry. These and similar license provisions help in find-
ing  the  balance  between  broad  access  to  technology  and  maintaining  the  value  of
the business opportunity for licensees.

Small Business Perspective
Q5. In  the  hearing,  we  discussed  both  university  and  large  corporation  perspectives
on  the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole.  How  do  you  think  the  experience  of  small  business
with  Bayh-Dole  differs  from  that  of  a  large  corporation?  Please  distinguish  be-
tween experiences you think are unique to individual industries from experiences
you believe are common to all small businesses.

A5. Bayh-Dole  is  particularly  valuable  to  small  businesses  in  the  United  States.
Often  lacking  the  infrastructure  and  funds  to  fully  exploit  in  isolation  their  inven-
tions,  small  businesses  rely  on  partnerships  with  noncompetitive  institutions  such
as  universities  that  have  more  infrastructure,  expertise,  and  resources.  Bayh-Dole
helps  ensure  that  intellectual  property  can  be  created  and  protected  during  this
process. In many small business enterprises, especially in the medical and pharma-
ceutical  arenas,  the  ability  to  protect  the  intellectual  property  created  in  a  small
business-university  research  partnership  (as  opposed  to  allowing  it  to  proceed  into
the  public  domain)  is  essential  to  future  funding  and  success  of  the  business,  as  I
mentioned  in  my  previous  testimony.  In  other  areas  such  as  telecommunications,
where freedom to practice is often as important as exclusivity, universities can still
utilize  the  Bayh-Dole  mechanism  to  nonexclusively  license  intellectual  property  to
multiple  small  businesses,  ensuring  that  the  commercial  potential  of  the  federally-
funded research is not lost.

In  addition  to  pre-existing  small  businesses,  Bayh-Dole  provides  impetus  for  the
creation  of  small  companies  based  on  university-owned  intellectual  property.  In  my
experience,  such  spinouts  are  either  based  on  university-owned  inventions  pre-

141

viously created using federal funding (and are therefore direct beneficiaries of Bayh-
Dole),  or  are  created  with  the  willing  participation  of  industry  sponsors  of  the  re-
search. In the latter case, the originally-sponsoring industrial concern will typically
accept  an  equity  stake  in  the  new  small  business,  usually  in  return  for  an  initial
investment. It is typical that the new company’s intellectual property relies on back-
ground  intellectual  property  held  by  the  university  and  created  with  federal  fund-
ing.  The  Bayh-Dole  act  allows  this  important  background  property  to  be  both  pro-
tected as well as licensed to the new concern.

Finally,  Small  Business  Innovative  Research  (SBIR)  grants  and  analogous  di-
rected  federal  funding  are  an  essential  resource  for  the  creation  and  support  of
small  businesses.  Often,  for  the  infrastructure,  expertise,  or  other  reasons  cited
above,  small  businesses  will  partner  with  universities  in  the  performance  of  these
grants.  Bayh-Dole  acts  as  a  ‘regularizer’  allowing  straightforward  negotiation  be-
tween  federally-funded  small  businesses  and  universities  while  simultaneously  pre-
serving the abilities of both parties to protect the produced intellectual property es-
sential for future company growth.

Best Practices
Q6. During  the  hearing,  the  witnesses  discussed  a  number  of  best  practices  which
improved  university-industry  collaboration  on  industry  sponsored  research.
Please  summarize,  in  priority  order,  your  top  recommendations  to  improve  col-
laboration on industry sponsored research.

A6. The  relationship  between  universities  and  industries  is  best  facilitated  by  rec-
ognition  and  understanding  of  the  respective  missions,  needs,  and  intents  of  both
parties.  Universities  exist  to  create  and  transfer  knowledge  through  their  edu-
cational  and  research  programs.  Companies  focus  on  improving  products  and  proc-
esses  in  order  to  enhance  shareholder  value.  In  many  cases  these  interests  are
aligned and synergistic. Both parties serve the public best when new products, serv-
ices, cures for diseases are made available to the public and that often leads to prof-
itable  business  and  economic  growth.  In  the  area  of  human  resources,  universities
provide an educated workforce and leaders in science, technology and business while
the  private  sector  creates  jobs  and  opportunities  for  those  highly  skilled  workers.
Research  needs  and  technology  transfer  practices  may  vary  from  discipline  to  dis-
cipline and among industry sectors. A best practice exists when these differences in
mission and role in society are recognized and valued in the university research re-
lationship.

Practices  that  enhance  understanding  and  improve  the  research  relationship  be-
tween  universities  and  industries  have  been  documented  several  times.  Most  re-
cently, the Council on Governmental Relations published a brochure, University In-
dustry  Research  Relationships,  which  is  available  from  that  organization  and  dis-
cusses the context and models for collaboration. The National Academies of Sciences
convened,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Government  University  Research  Roundtable,
a group of companies and universities to examine the research relationship between
academia  and  industry.  This  group  formed  the  University-Industry  Demonstration
Partnership  (UIDP)  the  purpose  of  which  is  to  nourish  and  expand  collaborative
partnerships between university and industry in the United States. After much dis-
cussion  about  the  missions,  values  and  constraints  of  both  parties,  the  UIDP  pub-
lished  a  document  entitled  Guiding  Principles  for  University-Industry  Endeavors.
That document is available on their website at http://www7.nationalacademies.org/
guirr/Guiding¥Principles.pdf. Best practices might be summed up in terms of find-
ing  common  ground  and  alignment  of  interests.  As  COGR  states  in  University  In-
dustry  Research  Relationships,  ‘‘many  successful  relationships  between  universities
and  industry  have  been  implemented  and  many  involve  the  parties  reaching  com-
promises  regarding  intellectual  property  that  satisfy  the  requirements  of  both  par-
ties.’’

Federal Government Oversight
Q7. The  Federal  Government  has  an  important  oversight  function  for  Bayh-Dole  to
insure that university patenting serves its intended purpose and is not misused.
What  specific  oversight  do  you  recommend,  including  oversight  by  individual
agencies funding federal research at universities?

A7. It  is  my  understanding  that  the  oversight  focal  point  for  Bayh-Dole  has  been
shifted  within  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  the  National  Institute  of  Standards
and  Technology.  I  believe  the  Department  of  Commerce  should  re-elevate  the  over-
sight function to the Secretary’s level or other high-level position to insure the nec-

STATEMENT OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION

Summary

The  Biotechnology  Industry  Organization  (BIO)  appreciates  this  opportunity  to
provide  the  perspective  of  its  members  on  the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  BIO  represents  over
1,100  companies,  universities  and  research  institutions  using  biotechnology  to  re-
search  and  develop  cutting  edge  health  care,  agricultural,  industrial  and  environ-
mental products and applications.

The  biotechnology  industry  is  one  of  the  most  R&D-intensive  and  capital-focused
industries in the world. The industry is primarily made up of small companies that
are  unprofitable  and  that  lose  billions  of  dollars  annually.  ’bet  it  holds  the  promise
for  a  cutting  edge  cure  for  Alzheimer’s,  drought  resistant  crops,  or  the  next  alter-
native energy source. With over 1,400 companies, many of which spun out of univer-
sity  research,  the  U.S.  leads  the  world  in  biotechnology  R&D.  In  2005,  the  U.S.
biotech industry spent $20 billion on research and development, and since its incep-
tion  roughly  two  decades  ago,  has  put  into  the  hands  of  the  public  more  than  300
biotech  products,  including  lifesaving  and  life-enhancing  health  care  treatments,
and  hundreds  of  diagnostic  tests.  The  industry  has  already  developed  dozens  of  in-
sect-resistant crops and environmentally friendly industrial applications.

All  of  this  accomplishment  has  occurred  despite  the  decades-long  development
time,  massive  investment  needs,  and  complex  regulatory  process  the  industry  must
face  before  bringing  its  products  and  applications  to  market.  The  Milken  Institute,
in  a  2006  report  entitled  ‘‘Mind-to-Market:  A  Global  Analysis  of  University  Bio-
technology  Technology  Transfer  and  Commercialization,’’[i]  identified  five  key  fac-
tors  that  contribute  to  the  successful  commercialization  of  university  biotechnology
research: a consistent and transparent national innovation policy that recognizes in-
tellectual  property  protection  and  promotes  entrepreneurial  capitalism;  the  avail-
ability  of  funding  and  venture  capital;  biotechnology  clusters  not  restricted  by  geo-
graphic borders; robust university technology transfer mechanisms; and patents and
licensing.

The  U.S.  system  of  commercializing  scientific  discoveries  has  made  it  the  world
leader  in  the  area  of  biotechnology  in  large  measure  because  it  takes  into  account
the factors identified by the Milken Report. However, this was not always the case.
Indeed, rapid commercialization of scientific discovery did not fully come about until
the  enactment  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  in  1980.  Prior  to  enactment  of  this  legislation,
publicly-funded research was owned by the government and offered for licensing on
a  non-exclusive  basis  or  simply  dedicated  to  the  public.  There  was  little  incentive
for  businesses  to  undertake  the  financial  risk  to  develop  a  product.  The  result  was
that  only  five  percent  of  publicly-funded  discoveries  were  ever  developed  into  new
or improved products.[ii] The Bayh-Dole Act allowed universities and research insti-
tutions  to  patent  and  retain  title  to  their  inventions.  Moreover,  the  Act  allowed  for
flexibility  in  licensing  of  publicly-funded  inventions  without  excessive  government
intervention. The motivation to license the technology in expectation of royalty pay-
ments  was  created.  This  provided  a  necessary  impetus  for  the  transfer  of  publicly-
sponsored research to the private sector, thereby dramatically stimulating the com-
mercialization  of  Federal  Government-supported  research.  The  result,  among  other
things, is the existence of innovative new therapeutics, diagnostics and tools, indus-
trial processes and agricultural products for the benefit of society.

From  the  perspective  of  the  biotechnology  industry,  over  the  past  25  years  the
Bayh-Dole  Act  has  accomplished  more  than  its  goal  of  turning  publicly-fielded  re-
search  into  useful,  commercial  products.  It  has  also  served  as  a  basic  tool  for  eco-
nomic  development  and  job  creation  in  the  United  States.  In  its  policy  statement
on July 24, 2007, the National Governors Association recognized the import of Bayh-
Dole and university technology transfer as catalysts for innovation and R&D.

The  Bayh-Dole  Act  has  become  a  template  for  innovation  and  economic  develop-
ment  for  other  enterprising  countries  such  as  India  and  China.  The  Milken  report
shows  that,  while  universities  in  the  United  States  have  clearly  set  the  standard
in commercializing research, other countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have
recognized the role of universities in spurring the biotechnology industry. The study
suggests that, in order for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in innovation, it must
continue  to  field  research  and  university  technology  transfer  offices,  encourage  the
transfer  of  innovative  research  to  the  private  sector,  and  ensure  strong  intellectual
property (IP) protection.

BIO applauds this committee’s oversight of this critically important Act to ensure
that  the  next  25  years  of  Bayh-Dole  provide  even  greater  benefit  to  the  American
public  and  the  world  community.  In  its  oversight  capacity,  this  Committee  should
carefully consider how pioneering policies like the Bayh-Dole Act have helped to cre-

ate  the  biotechnology  industry  and  U.S.  leadership  in  this  area,  as  well  as  the
broader economic and societal benefits from the Act.
The Role of Patents in Biotechnology

In  BIO’s  view,  efficient  technology  transfer  is  intricately  linked  to  strong  IP  pro-
tections  and  free  market  incentives.  In  the  context  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  patents
serve  as  the  legal  instrument  used  in  the  transfer  of  technology,  information  and
know-how.  Commercializing  an  invention  in  the  biotech  sector  is  a  lengthy  process
requiring significant amounts of capital, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
While government funding and research is critical in biotech R&D, substantial addi-
tional  financing  from  the  public  and  private  capital  markets  is  required  to  actually
take  the  product  from  the  idea  stage  to  one  that  can  be  used  by  the  public.  Let’s
take  as  an  example  a  typical  health  care-related  biotech  discovery.  A  researcher,
typically  in  a  publicly-funded  laboratory,  discovers  a  gene  whose  presence  is  only
found  in  a  particular  type  of  cancer.  The  researcher  also  determines  that  the  pres-
ence  of  this  gene  signals  the  presence  of  a  quantifiable  amount  of  a  particular  pro-
tein.  Translating  this  initial  discovery  into  a  therapeutic  application  can  take  dec-
ades  and  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  However,  it  is  at  this  early  stage  when
the promise of a therapy is on the horizon that the researcher can seek patent pro-
tection  on  the  various  aspects  of  the  discovery.  By  way  of  a  patent,  the  researcher
can  generate  interest  in  the  further  development  of  this  potential  new  product  by,
for  example,  out-licensing  the  invention,  or  forming  a  spin-off  company  focusing  on
the  R&D  of  this  early-stage  discovery.  In  both  cases,  the  patent  is  the  asset  that
creates  a  forward  trajectory  for  the  project.  In  the  former  case,  an  interested  com-
pany  partner  would,  among  other  things,  review  the  strength  and  scope  of  the  EP
protecting  the  early-stage  discovery  to  determine  the  worth  of  the  investment.  In
the latter case, the IP generates the interest of institutional investors, venture cap-
italists,  or  other  partners  encouraging  the  creation  of  an  early-stage  company.  In
any  event,  the  early-stage,  publicly-funded  discovery  is  now  on  its  way  to  develop-
ment. Of course the road to development from this point is long and torturous, and
often  fraught  with  set  backs,  but  the  transfer  of  technology  is  complete  and  the
wheels are set in motion.

From this point on, patents play a significant role in investment of capital in the
biotechnology  markets.  Investors  measure  opportunities  in  the  biopharmaceutical
and  pharmaceutical  sector  through  potential  sales  of  the  drug/product,  the  market
exclusivity prospect through patent protection, other forms of marketing exclusivity
(such as orphan drug exclusivity), or other means to gauge the strength and predict-
ability of patent protection.

The  ancillary  benefits  of  this  ecosystem  to  the  economy  in  the  form  of  jobs,  tax
revenue and new companies should not be overlooked. According. to the Association
for  University  Technology  Managers’  (AUTM)  annual  report[iii],  the  Bayh-Dole  Act
continues to create hundreds of companies and tens of thousands of new jobs annu-
ally. Virtually every state has a biotechnology center or initiative.

If  the  major  policy  objective  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  to  use  the  patent  system  to
promote  the  commercialization  and  utilization  of  inventions  arising  from  federally-
supported  research  or  development,  then  the  biotechnology  sector  is  an  exemplary
measure  of  its  success.  The  Bayh-Dole  Act  provides  the  environment  for  bio-
technology companies to take the risk of investing in biotechnology R&D. It provides
the lure of market exclusivity as the incentive for companies to work ’in cooperation
with  public  institutions.  There  is  little  misunderstanding  of  the  primary  obligation
that  companies  have  under  Bayh-Dole  to  commercialize  the  licensed  technology.
This  point  is  solidified  by  the  statute’s  provision  that  failure  to  commercialize  a  li-
censed  federally-funded  invention  can  be  the  basis  for  government  march-in  rights.
While  BIO  believes  that  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  is  working  quite  well,  there  are  ways
to  ensure  that  maximum  benefit  is  continually  derived  from  its  provisions.  As  an
example,  BIO  urges  that  the  patent  system  should  be  kept  strong  and  predictable.
Congress is currently considering patent reform legislation that, iii its current form,
could  negatively  impact  commercialization  of  publicly-funded  research  by  under-
mining  the  strength,  value,  and  predictability  of  patent  protection.  This  would,  in
turn, make it much less likely that companies and venture capital companies would
invest  in  risky,  cutting-edge  research,  resulting  in  publicly-funded  research  sitting
on laboratory shelves. BIO recently testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
about its views on patent reform, and the university technology transfer community
has weighed in with similar concerns.[iv]

In  addition,  consistent  and  transparent  implementation  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act,  to-
gether with a cataloguing of ‘‘best practices’’ and successful partnerships, would pro-
vide more efficient transfer of technology. Congress should consider funding studies

150

that would aid in the identification and compilation of such best practices and iden-
tify how best to support the technology transfer offices in their overall mission.

In this spirit, BIO cautions against policies that would weaken market incentives
through  excessive  government  intervention.  We  can  point  to  lessons  learned  in  the
1990s  in  studying  the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  Concerns  that  health  care  reform  proposals
from the early 1990s could lead to price controls led to serious perturbations in the
market  for  biotechnology  investment.  The  impact  of  potential  price  controls  on  the
biotechnology  industry  was  immediate  and  powerful.  The  capital  markets  crashed
and investment in biotech research nearly dried up.

A  similar  result  occurred  in  1999  when  President  Clinton  and  Prime  Minister
Blair  were  cited  in  the  press  as  supporting  the  notion  that  certain  classes  of  pat-
ented  genetic  information  should  be  freely  available  to  all  at  the  time  the  human
genome  was  ‘‘unraveled.’’  Despite  a  clear  correction  by  the  President  the  next  day,
it took six months for the biotechnology capital markets to recover.

In  both  cases,  a  threat  to  free-market  protection  and  undermining  intellectual
property  rights  drove  investors  away  froth  biotechnology  research.  The  Bayh-Dole
Act was designed to facilitate the transfer of publicly-funded research to the private
sector for further development and commercialization. The careful balance set forth
in the Act has been hugely successful. We have learned from history that excessive
government  intervention  can  disincentivize  biotechnology  companies  from  under-
taking  the  huge  risks  to  bring  innovative  products  and  services  to  all  Americans.
Conclusion

The  legislative  framework  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  has  worked  well  over  these  25
years. The House Committee on Science and Technology is to be commended for un-
dertaking  this  examination  of  the  Bayh-Dole  Act.  BIO  appreciates  the  opportunity
to  provide  insight  into  the  impact  of  Bayh-Dole  on  the  biotech  industry  and  to  de-
scribe  the  nature  of  the  industry  and  its  contributions  to  the  improvement  of  the
human condition. BIO’s members are strong supporters of the Bayh-Dole Act, which
has opened the door to the creation of many biotechnology companies that have de-
veloped  important  advances  and  cutting-edge  solutions  to  some  of  the  world’s  most
intractable problems. We caution against policies that would weaken market incen-
tives  through  excessive  government  intervention.  We  urge  Congress  to  continue  its
far-sighted  approach  to  innovation  as  it  continues  oversight  of  the  effective  imple-
mentation of the Bayh-Dole Act.
