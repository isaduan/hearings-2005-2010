HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Cyber Security: U.S. Vulnerability

and Preparedness

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On Thursday, September 15, 2005, the House Science Committee will hold a hear-
ing  to  examine  the  extent  of  U.S.  vulnerability  to  cyber  attacks  on  critical  infra-
structure  such  as  utility  systems,  and  what  the  Federal  Government  and  private
sector are doing, and should be doing, to prevent and prepare for such attacks. The
hearing  will  also  examine  what  duties  should  be  given  to  the  new  Assistant  Sec-
retary  for  Cyber  Security  and  Telecommunications  at  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security.
2. Witnesses

sion  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS).  Prior  to  joining  DHS,  he
served  as  senior  advisor  for  Information  Technology  Security  and  Privacy  to  the
President’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.
Mr. John Leggate is  the  Chief  Information  Officer  at  BP  Inc.  (formerly  known  as
British  Petroleum).  In  addition,  he  is  Chairman  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officers’
Roundtable  on  Digital  and  Cyber  Infrastructure  Security  at  the  industry  organiza-
tion Business Executives for National Security.

mation  Officer  of  The  Dow  Chemical  Company.  In  addition,  he  leads  the  Chemical
Sector Cyber Security Information Sharing Forum, an industry association.
Mr. Gerald Freese is the Director of Enterprise Information Security at American
Electric Power, one of the largest electric utilities in the United States. He has also
been  active  in  the  North  American  Electric  Reliability  Council-coordinated  develop-
ment of cyber security standards for the energy industry.
Mr. Andrew Geisse is the Chief Information Officer of SBC Services Inc. (formerly
Southwestern  Bell  Corporation),  the  largest  telecommunications  carrier  in  the
United States.

3. Overarching Questions

• How  do  critical  infrastructure  sectors  depend  on  public  and  private  informa-
tion systems? What are the possible consequences for these sectors of disrup-
tion or attack on their information systems? What steps are being and should
be taken to secure these systems?

• What are the most critical responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS) in cyber security for critical infrastructure sectors, and what are
the  most  urgent  steps  the  new  Assistant  Secretary  for  Cyber  Security  and
Telecommunications should take?

• In what areas are current cyber security technical solutions for critical infra-
structure  sectors  inadequate?  Where  is  further  research  needed  to  mitigate
existing  and  emerging  threats  and  vulnerabilities?  How  should  federal  agen-
cies,  such  as  DHS,  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),  the  National  In-
stitute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  and  the  Defense  Advanced  Re-
search Projects Agency (DARPA), and academic researchers work with indus-
try to define priorities and support research in these areas?

4. Issues
Is  the  U.S.  adequately  protecting  critical  information  systems  and  is  the
U.S. able to detect, respond to, and recover from a cyber attacks on critical
infrastructure?

While  industry  and  the  Federal  Government  have  increased  their  focus  on  cyber
security  in  recent  years,  vulnerabilities  remain,  and  many  experts  believe  the  U.S.
needs to do more. An informal survey by a business group early this year found that
in  the  telecommunications,  energy,  chemical,  and  transportations  industries,  execu-
tives estimated that 20 to 35 percent of their revenue depends directly on the Inter-
net. Yet despite the crucial role of information technology, the vulnerabilities in in-
formation technology systems are myriad . About 10 new entries are added each day
to  the  National  Vulnerability  Database  (maintained  by  the  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology),  which  contains  about  12,000  entries  describing
vulnerabilities  in  commonly  used  information  technology  products.  (Statistics  about
attacks  on  critical  infrastructure  are  hard  to  obtain  because  such  attacks  are  often
not reported.)
Is  there  are  clear  line  of  responsibility  within  the  Federal  Government  to
deal with cyber security?

When  DHS  was  formed  in  2002,  cyber  security  responsibilities  (other  than  re-
search and development) were assigned to the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure
Protection.  Ever  since,  industry  representatives  have  repeatedly  expressed  concern
that  cyber  security  has  been  a  distant  second  to  physical  security  in  DHS’s  critical
infrastructure protection activities and that the lack of a high-level official dedicated
to cyber security has meant that the Department has failed to devote attention and
resources  to  cyber  security.  In  May  2005,  the  Government  Accountability  Office
(GAO)  found  that  DHS  was  having  trouble  with  a  number  of  its  cyber  responsibil-
ities,  including  developing  national  cyber  threat  and  vulnerability  assessments  and
government/industry  contingency  recovery  plans  for  cyber  security,  establishing  ef-
fective  partnerships  with  stakeholders,  and  achieving  two-way  information  sharing
with these stakeholders. (The summary of this report is included in Attachment A.)
In response to Congressional and industry concerns, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity created in July the new position of Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and
Telecommunications  to  bring  a  higher  profile  to  this  area  and  high  level  attention
to these problems. The position has not yet been filled.
Are  private  companies  doing  enough  to  secure  their  information  systems?
To what extent are they coordinating with each other and the Federal Gov-
ernment on cyber security?

The record is mixed. For many companies, it can be difficult to quantify the risks
associated with their dependence on information systems and hence difficult to jus-
tify  investment  in  cyber  security.  In  other  cases,  the  relevant  cyber  security  tech-
nologies  may  not  be  available.  In  many  industries,  companies  have  undertaken
cyber  security  activities  within  industry  organizations  to  set  standards,  share  best
practices,  and  work  with  information  technology  companies  to  improve  the  security
of  information  systems  and  increase  their  cyber  security  options.  (The  companies
testifying  have  generally  been  leaders  in  taking  cyber  security  seriously.)  In  some
cases, cyber security work has been hampered by the problems in the Federal Gov-
ernment described above. Industry groups have indicated that they do not yet trust
the  processes  for  sharing  sensitive  information  related  to  their  cyber  security  with
the  government  and  have  not  yet  been  convinced  of  the  value  of  information  and
services DHS would provide in return.
What should the priorities be for federal cyber security research and devel-
opment programs? Is funding for these programs adequate?

Recommended  areas  for  federal  cyber  security  research  in  general  were  outlined
in the recent report1 of the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee
(PITAC)  and  include  monitoring  and  detection  technologies,  software  quality  assur-
ance processes, authentication techniques, mitigation and recovery technologies, and
metrics,  benchmarks,  and  best  practices.  The  PITAC  report  recommended  substan-
tial  increases  in  funding  at  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),  DHS,  and  the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). (Currently, funding for cyber
security  research  programs  at  NSF  and  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and

curity:  A  Crisis  of  Prioritization,  on  March  18,  2005.  It  is  available  on  line  at  http://

Technology  (NIST)  is  well  below  the  levels  authorized  in  the  Cyber  Security  Re-
search  and  Development  Act.)  The  Cyber  Security  Industry  Alliance,  an  association
of  cyber  security  software,  hardware  and  services  companies,  the  Internet  Security
Alliance, an association of information security users from sectors such as banking,
insurance, and manufacturing, and the Information Technology Association of Amer-
ica, a trade association of the information technology industry, have all also publicly
recommended  increased  federal  funding  for  cyber  security  research  and  develop-
ment.

5. Brief Overview

• Critical  infrastructure2 sectors  include  electric  power  generation  and  trans-
mission,  oil  and  gas  production  and  distribution,  communications,  chemicals,
food production, banking and finance, transportation systems, and water proc-
essing systems. These sectors are increasingly dependent on information sys-
tems  to  administer  business  operations  (such  as  billing  and  supply  chain
management)  and  to  monitor  and  control  physical  operations  (such  as  manu-
facturing processes and distribution systems).

• As reliance on information technology grows, the number of ways that critical
infrastructure systems can be interfered with and the extent of disruption or
damage that can be created via such interference is also growing. In addition,
the potential impact of a combined physical and cyber attack on a critical fa-
cility—e.g., using disruption of information systems to interfere with response
and recovery after an explosion—would be severe.

• Some cyber security products and techniques (such as firewalls, intrusion de-
tection  systems,  and  virus-protection  checks)  can  be  used  to  safeguard  many
types  of  standard  information  systems  (e.g.,  protecting  billing  systems  and
customer  databases).  However,  specialized  information  technology  products
are  often  used  to  manage  and  control  critical  infrastructure  facilities.  These
process control systems often use customized or older hardware and software
and have different performance requirements and hence may require special-
ized security solutions and strategies.

• In May 2005, GAO assessed the DHS role in cyber critical infrastructure pro-
tection  and  found  that  DHS  was  having  trouble  with  a  number  of  its  cyber
responsibilities,  including  developing  national  cyber  threat  and  vulnerability
assessments  and  government/industry  contingency  recovery  plans  for  cyber
security  (including  a  plan  for  recovering  key  Internet  functions),  establishing
effective  partnerships  with  stakeholders,  and  achieving  two-way  information
sharing with these stakeholders.
• In  response  to  stakeholder  and  Congressional  concerns  that  DHS  needed  to
make information security, particularly information security for critical infra-
structure  sectors,  a  higher  priority,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  an-
nounced in July 2005 that the Department would create a new position of As-
sistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications. This new posi-
tion will have responsibility for identifying and assessing the vulnerability of
critical  telecommunications  infrastructure  and  assets,  providing  timely  and
usable  threat  information,  and  leading  the  national  response  to  cyber  and
telecommunications attacks.
• In  information  technology  systems,  new  vulnerabilities  and  new  threats
emerge  regularly  and  spread  quickly.  Cyber  security  research  programs  sup-
ported  by  the  Federal  Government  and  the  private  sector  develop  tools  that
provide  security  in  the  current  environment,  as  well  as  produce  the  defenses
against  the  next  generation  of  cyber  security  risks.  Following  passage  of  the
Cyber  Security  Research  and  Development  Act  in  2002,  funding  for  National
Science  Foundation  programs  in  this  area  has  increased;  however,  at  the
same  time  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  funding  for  un-
classified  research  in  cyber  security  has  dropped  significantly.  Other  federal
cyber security research and development programs exist, particularly at DHS
and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, but these are rel-
atively small.

2 As  defined  in  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act  (P.L.  107–56),  critical  infrastructure  is  ‘‘systems  and
assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruc-
tion of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic
security, national public health and safety, or any combination of those matters.’’ This definition
is used broadly throughout the Federal Government.

6. Background
Critical Infrastructure Sectors and Information Security

6

Critical  infrastructure,  as  defined  in  the  USA  PATRIOT  Act,  is  ‘‘systems  and  as-
sets,  whether  physical  or  virtual,  so  vital  to  the  United  States  that  the  incapacity
or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on secu-
rity,  national  economic  security,  national  public  health  and  safety,  or  any  combina-
tion of those matters.’’ Examples of critical infrastructure include electric power gen-
eration  and  transmission,  oil  and  gas  production  and  distribution,  communications,
chemicals, agriculture and food processing, banking and finance, transportation sys-
tems,  and  water  processing  systems.  Because  of  its  vital  role  in  the  U.S.  security,
economy,  and  quality  of  life,  the  elements  of  the  U.S.  critical  infrastructure  are  a
potential  target  for  terrorists,  who  could  use  physical  or  cyber  attacks  to  interfere
with, disrupt, damage, or destroy important facilities and capabilities.

Industry  is  increasingly  dependent  on  information  technology  for  both  business
operations and process controls, and many of these information systems directly use,
or  are  accessible  through,  public  systems  (e.g.,  the  Internet)  and  technologies  (e.g.,
Wi-Fi and common operating systems). Yet the Internet was not designed with secu-
rity in mind.

Control systems (systems that run manufacturing and distribution facilities) raise
different  security  issues  than  do  the  business/administrative  systems.  It  is  harder
to shut the control systems down to make changes in software or hardware because
doing  so  means  shutting  down  an  industrial  operation,  such  as  chemical  manufac-
turing  or  electricity  generation.  In  addition,  the  control  systems  operate  equipment
that  represents  a  major  capital  expense  and  that  is  replaced  or  upgraded  less  fre-
quently  than  are  business  systems.  As  a  result,  security  fixes  to  control  systems
often require retrofitting, rather than just waiting for equipment to be replaced. Fi-
nally, while business systems (for activities like billing) are relatively similar across
industries,  the  control  systems  generally  use  specialized  protocols  and  configura-
tions specific to a particular industry. As a result, customized security solutions and
strategies, including specialized testing, need to be developed.

Industry  responses  to  cyber  vulnerability  has  depended  on:  (1)  the  type  of  infor-
mation systems used in the sector, (2) how clear the risks associated with cyber at-
tacks  are,  (3)  what  the  value  and  return  on  investment  in  cyber  security  would  be,
(4) the availability of relevant cyber security technologies, and (5) (sometimes) what
governmental  action  has  been  taken  or  is  perceived  as  having  the  potential  to  be
taken.  For  example,  the  financial  and  banking  industries  were  very  aggressive  in
adopting information security technologies, due in part to the fact that technologies
to  protect  information  and  communications  (the  primary  need  in  this  area)  have
been a focus of cyber security development efforts for a long time because the extent
of the vulnerability was very clear.

In  other  industries,  there  are  a  variety  of  cyber  security-focused  activities  under-
way. In the electric power industry, the North American Electric Reliability Council
(an  industry  coordination  group)  recently  developed  and  adopted  an  interim  cyber
security  standard  that  outlines  minimum  requirements  needed  to  ensure  the  secu-
rity of electronic exchange of information needed to support grid reliability and mar-
ket  operations;  work  on  a  permanent  standard  is  underway.  In  addition,  Congress
has  focused  attention  on  cyber  security  as  a  key  element  of  ensuring  electric  reli-
ability and drinking water safety. The Environmental Protection Agency has worked
with the industry on understanding how their water processing facilities depend on
information systems and what risks that creates.

The  chemical  sector  has  developed  a  Chemical  Sector  Cyber  Security  Program,
which  is  building  on  existing  cooperative  industry  groups  to  carry  out  cyber  secu-
rity-specific  activities.  A  sector-wide  cyber  security  strategy  was  organized  in  2002,
and  activities  currently  underway  include  work  on  establishing  management  prac-
tices,  guidelines,  and  standards,  on  information  sharing,  and  on  encouraging  accel-
erated development of improved security technologies. In addition, the chemical sec-
tor  companies  involved  with  the  program  support  legislation  that  will  establish  na-
tional  security  guidelines  for  chemical  facilities,  require  companies  to  conduct  site
vulnerability assessments and implement security plans, and create strong enforce-
ment authority to help ensure facilities and systems are secure.

In  addition  to  specific  cyber  security  activities,  all  critical  infrastructure  sectors
have Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), which provide a forum for
companies  to  exchange,  analyze  and  disseminate  information  about  vulnerabilities,
threats,  and  incidents  in  a  trusted  environment.  (The  establishment  of  ISACs  was
mainly  a  response  to  Presidential  Decision  Directive  63  (issued  in  1998),  which  en-
couraged industry to form such groups. Each ISAC has a different structure and re-
lationship with the government, depending on the specific industry’s needs, history,

and regulatory environment.) In general, discussion of cyber security issues are con-
sidered  an  important  element  of  ISAC-based  interactions,  and  cross-sector  discus-
sions of cyber security issues are coordinated by the information technology sector’s
ISAC.
Department of Homeland Security Cyber Security Activities and Responsibilities

Cyber security activities at DHS are carried out in two directorates: the National
Cyber Security Division (NCSD), located in the Information Analysis and Infrastruc-
ture  Protection  Directorate,  is  responsible  for  operational  cyber  security;  and  the
Science  and  Technology  Directorate  is  responsible  for  cyber  security  research  and
development programs.

Operational Cyber Security at DHS

After the recently completed department-wide Second Stage Review, the Secretary
of Homeland Security has proposed and begun to implement a number of organiza-
tional  changes,  including  the  creation  of  an  Assistant  Secretary  for  Cyber  Security
and  Telecommunications  position.  This  office  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  and
assessing the vulnerability of critical telecommunications infrastructure and assets,
providing  timely  and  usable  threat  information,  and  leading  the  national  response
to  cyber  and  telecommunications  attacks.  (To  date,  the  NCSD  has  reported  to  the
existing  Assistant  Secretary  for  Infrastructure  Protection;  going  forward,  the  new
Assistant Secretary will be parallel to this position.3 )

The responsibilities of the NCSD are defined by several documents, including the
National  Strategy  to  Secure  Cyberspace,  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive
7 (HSPD–7) on Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection,4
the  Interim  National  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan,  and  the  National  Response
Plan. In FY06, $73 million was requested for NCSD, a $6 million increase from the
level  appropriated  for  FY05.  The  NCSD’s  mission,  as  defined  in  HSPD–7,  includes
analysis, warning, information sharing, vulnerability reduction, mitigation, and aid-
ing  national  recovery  efforts  for  critical  infrastructure  information  systems.5 Cur-
rently,  within  these  broad  goals,  three  areas  of  particular  concern  and  focus  for
NCSD  in  the  area  of  critical  infrastructure  protection  are  (1)  strategies  to  improve
the  resiliency  of  the  Internet  against  disruption,  (2)  improving  the  security  of  con-
trol systems, and (3) improving software assurance (trying to move from patch man-
agement to systems that emphasize security as software is being developed).

One of the most important activities of NCSD is coordination with the private sec-
tor  on  efforts  to  reduce  vulnerabilities  and  minimize  the  severity  of  cyber  attacks.
Information  sharing  is  necessary  to  ensure  awareness  of  vulnerabilities,  and  ways
to mitigate vulnerabilities, awareness of threats and attack methods, and prepared-
ness  for  response  and  recovery.  Companies  are  expected  to  be  a  source  of  informa-
tion about what problems they are experiencing and what solutions have been effec-
tive,  while  the  government  (primarily  via  DHS)  is  expected  to  be  a  source  of  infor-
mation about threats. Both government and industry acknowledge that information
sharing  needs  to  be  improved.  Industry  has  been  reluctant  to  share  sensitive  infor-
mation  incidents.  In  addition,  it  has  been  unclear  whether  DHS  has  developed  the
policies or attracted the expertise to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive informa-
tion and to provide reliable analysis and feedback about threats and potential solu-
tions.

A  variety  of  activities  are  underway  in  the  NCSD  to  carry  out  its  mission.  These
include  the  U.S.  Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team  (US–CERT),  which  was  es-
tablished in 2003 as a partnership between DHS and the public and private sectors.
US–CERT 
threats  and
vulnerabilities,  disseminating  cyber  threat  warning  information,  and  coordinating

for  analyzing  and  reducing  cyber 

is  responsible 

3 The  new  Assistant  Secretary  for  Cyber  Security  and  Telecommunications  will  be  Presi-
dentially  appointed,  but  not  Senate  confirmed.  The  new  position  was  announced  on  July  13,
2005, but as of the date of this hearing an appointment had not yet been made.

4 Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  7  (HSPD–7)  on  Critical  Infrastructure  Identifica-
tion,  Prioritization,  and  Protection  is  available  on  line  at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/re-
leases/2003/12/20031217-5.html.

5 To  meet  its  responsibilities  from  HSPD–7,  as  well  as  other  national  strategies  and  plans,
NCSD has defined for itself six core goals: (1) establish a National Cyber Security Response Sys-
tem to prevent, detect, respond to, and reconstitute rapidly after cyber incidents; (2) work with
public  and  private  sectors  to  reduce  vulnerabilities  and  minimize  the  severity  of  cyber  attacks;
(3) promote a comprehensive national awareness program to empower American businesses, the
general workforce, and the general population to secure their own parts of cyberspace; (4) foster
adequate  training  and  education  programs  to  support  the  Nation’s  cyber  security  needs;  (5)  co-
ordinate  with  the  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  communities  to  identify  and  reduce  threats
to cyberspace; and (6) build a world-class organization that aggressively advances its cyber secu-
rity mission and goals in partnership with its public and private stakeholders.

incident  response  activities.  Another  key  NCSD  activity  is  organizing  exercises  to
test  preparedness  and  response  plans  for  cyber  attack.  The  next  such  exercise  is
scheduled  for  November  2005  and  will  include  public  and  private  sector  partici-
pants,  including  companies  from  the  energy,  financial,  and  transportation  sectors.

Cyber Security Research and Development at DHS

Research  and  development  related  to  cyber  security  are  the  responsibility  of  the
DHS  Science  and  Technology  Directorate.  In  FY06,  $16.7  million  was  requested  for
the  cyber  security  programs  in  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate,  a  $1.3  mil-
lion  decrease  from  the  level  appropriated  for  FY05.  Specific  programs  focus  on  im-
proving  the  security  of  Internet  communication  protocols  and  developing  tech-
nologies to enhance the cyber security of critical infrastructure sectors, including of
process control systems. Support and coordination is also provided for the collection
of  large-scale  data  sets  about  network  behavior  that  researchers  can  use  to  better
understand  problems  with  networks  and  design  potential  solutions.  Testbeds  are
also  a  critical  element  of  DHS  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  cyber  security
programs.  They  provide  support  for  and  participate  in  the  NSF-funded  Defense
Technology  Experimental  Research  (DETER)  testbed  (described  below).  They  also
work  with  the  Department  of  Energy  (at  Sandia  and  Idaho  National  Laboratories)
to  support  a  control  systems  testbed,  which  is  critical  for  design  and  verification  of
security technologies for control system applications. Since these systems often oper-
ate with real-time consequences and continuously or almost continuously, any secu-
rity  solution  must  be  designed  for  the  configuration  in  which  the  equipment  and
software is used and rigorously tested in realistic situations.
Cyber Security at Other Government Agencies and Interagency Coordination

Operational Cyber Security

Each  critical  infrastructure  sector  is  associated  with  a  lead  government  agency.
For  some  sectors  (e.g.,  chemicals,  transportation  systems,  information  technology
and  telecommunications),  the  lead  agency  is  DHS,  but  for  many  other  sectors,  an-
other  agency  is  the  lead  (e.g.,  the  Department  of  Energy  for  the  electric  power  and
oil and gas sectors, the Environmental Protection Agency for water treatment facili-
ties,  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  for  banking  and  finance,  and  the  Department
of  Agriculture  for  the  food  sector).  However,  HSPD–7,  the  2003  Presidential  Direc-
tive that designated the lead agencies, also clearly articulated that DHS would con-
tinue to maintain an organization to serve as a focal point for the security of cyber-
space.  For  example,  DHS,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD),  and  the  Department
of Justice co-chair the interagency National Cyber Response Coordination Group. In
addition  to  coordinating  with  other  agencies  on  the  cyber  security  of  critical  infra-
structure  facilities,  DHS  also  works  with  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,
which  has  significant  responsibilities  for  the  security  of  the  Federal  Government’s
information systems.

Cyber Security Research and Development Programs

Significant cyber security research and development programs are underway in a
variety  of  federal  agencies,  including  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),  the
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  and  the  Defense  Advanced
Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA).  The  programs  at  NSF  and  NIST  were  author-
ized by the Cyber Security Research and Development Act (P.L. 107–305).

At  NSF,  cyber  security  research  is  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  the  Cyber
Trust  program,  which  supports  projects  designed  to  make  networked  computer  sys-
tems  more  predictable,  more  accountable,  and  less  vulnerable  to  attack  and  abuse.
This  program  is  funded  at  $65  million  in  FY05,  and  the  projects  supported  cover
a wide variety of information security areas. Critical infrastructure applications are
included;  in  August  2005,  NSF  provided  funding  to  a  new  center  at  the  University
of  Illinois  to  perform  research  to  support  the  design,  construction  and  validation  of
a  secure  cyberinfrastructure  for  the  next-generation  electric  power  grid.  (Both  the
Department  of  Energy  and  DHS  have  pledged  to  collaborate  with  NSF  to  fund  and
manage  this  effort.)  Another  relevant  project  is  the  Cyber  Defense  Technology  Ex-
perimental  Research  (DETER)  testbed,  which  provides  an  experimental  environ-
ment  in  which  government,  academic,  and  industry  cyber  security  researchers  can
safely analyze and measure attacks and develop attack mitigation and confinement
strategies.  (DHS  also  provides  some  funding  for  DETER.)  These  research  and
testbeds  projects  also  have  educational  elements,  as  the  laboratories  supported  by
those  funds  become  centers  of  expertise  in  information  systems  for  critical  infra-
structure  and  train  the  personnel  that  critical  infrastructure  companies  and  infor-
mation  technology  companies  need  to  improve  the  security  of  critical  infrastructure
sector  applications.  In  addition  to  its  cyber  security  research  programs,  NSF  also

supports  cyber  security  education  activities,  including  scholarships  and  curriculum
development (these programs received $16 million in FY05).

9

At NIST, cyber security activities are centered in the Computer Security Division,
which  was  funded  at  $19  million  in  FY05.  The  division’s  activities  include  devel-
oping standards, metrics, tests, guidelines, and validation programs related to infor-
mation security and studying and raising awareness of information technology risks,
vulnerabilities,  and  protection  requirements.  NIST  also  has  specific  responsibilities
under  the  Federal  Information  Security  Management  Act  of  2002  for  developing
standards  for  federal  information  systems  security  and  supporting  federal  agencies’
cyber security efforts. An example of a recent NIST cyber security project (supported
by  DHS)  is  the  August  2005  launch  of  the  National  Vulnerability  Database,  which
contains  about  12,000  entries  describing  vulnerabilities  in  commonly-used  informa-
tion technology products. (About 10 new entries are added each day.) The database
integrates all publicly available U.S. Government vulnerability resources and is de-
signed to provide references to industry resources.

A number of other agencies, mainly in DOD, have cyber security research and de-
velopment activities. The DOD activities focus mainly on specific information assur-
ance requirements related to DOD’s military and intelligence missions. The Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  programs  are  focused  primarily  on  applications  related  to  the  en-
ergy  and  electric  power  sectors  (as  in  the  work  on  control  systems  testbeds  at  De-
partment of Energy laboratories described above).

All  of  these  programs  are  coordinated  through  the  National  Science  and  Tech-
nology Council’s (NSTC’s) Interagency Working Group on Critical Information Infra-
structure  Protection  Research  and  Development.  In  response  to  recommendations
from  the  President’s  Information  Technology  Advisory  Committee,  this  interagency
group has recently been reformulated to report to both the NSTC Subcommittee on
Infrastructure  and  its  Subcommittee  on  Networking  and  Information  Technology
Research  and  Development.  This  group  has  recently  begun  work  on  defining  top
cyber  security  research  and  development  needs  and  mapping  those  needs  against
current federal activities.

Critical Infrastructure Protection: Department of Homeland
Security Faces Challenges in Fulfilling Cyber Security Re-
sponsibilities

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REPORT GAO–05–434

http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05434.pdf

Excerpt: Results in Brief

As the focal point for critical infrastructure protection, DHS has many cyber secu-
rity-related roles and responsibilities that are called for in law and policy. These re-
sponsibilities  include  developing  plans,  building  partnerships,  and  improving  infor-
mation  sharing,  as  well  as  implementing  activities  related  to  the  five  priorities  in
the national cyberspace strategy: (1) developing and enhancing national cyber anal-
ysis and warning, (2) reducing cyberspace threats and vulnerabilities, (3) promoting
awareness  of  and  training  in  security  issues,  (4)  securing  governments’  cyberspace,
and  (5)  strengthening  national  security  and  international  cyberspace  security  co-
operation.  To  fulfill  its  cyber  security  role,  in  June  2003,  DHS  established  the  Na-
tional Cyber Security Division to serve as a national focal point for addressing cyber
security and coordinating the implementation of cyber security efforts.

While  DHS  has  initiated  multiple  efforts,  it  has  not  fully  addressed  any  of  the
13  key  cyber  security-related  responsibilities  that  we  identified  in  federal  law  and
policy,  and  it  has  much  work  ahead  in  order  to  be  able  to  fully  address  them.  For
example, DHS (1) has recently issued the Interim National Infrastructure Protection
Plan,  which  includes  cyber  security  elements;  (2)  operates  the  United  States  Com-
puter  Emergency  Readiness  Team  to  address  the  need  for  a  national  analysis  and
warning  capability;  and  (3)  has  established  forums  to  foster  information  sharing
among federal officials with information security responsibilities and among various
law  enforcement  entities.  However,  DHS  has  not  yet  developed  national  threat  and
vulnerability  assessments  or  developed  and  exercised  government  and  government/
industry  contingency  recovery  plans  for  cyber  security,  including  a  plan  for  recov-
ering  key  Internet  functions.  Further,  DHS  continues  to  have  difficulties  in  devel-
oping  partnerships—as  called  for  in  federal  policy—with  other  federal  agencies,
State and local governments, and the private sector.

DHS faces a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to fulfill its cyber
CIP responsibilities. Key challenges include achieving organizational stability; gain-
ing  organizational  authority;  overcoming  hiring  and  contracting  issues;  increasing
awareness about cyber security roles and capabilities; establishing effective partner-
ships  with  stakeholders  (other  federal  agencies,  State  and  local  governments,  and
the private sector); achieving two-way information sharing with these stakeholders;
and  demonstrating  the  value  DHS  can  provide.  In  its  strategic  plan  for  cyber  secu-
rity, DHS has identified steps that can begin to address these challenges. However,
until  it  effectively  confronts  and  resolves  these  underlying  challenges,  DHS  will
have  difficulty  achieving  significant  results  in  strengthening  the  cyber  security  of
our  nation’s  critical  infrastructures,  and  our  nation  will  lack  the  strong  cyber  secu-
rity focal point envisioned in federal law and policy.

We  are  making  recommendations  to  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to
strengthen the Department’s ability to implement key cyber security responsibilities
by completing critical activities and resolving underlying challenges.

DHS  provided  written  comments  on  a  draft  of  this  report  (see  app.  III).  In  brief,
DHS  agreed  that  strengthening  cyber  security  is  central  to  protecting  the  Nation’s
critical  infrastructures  and  that  much  remains  to  be  done.  In  addition,  DHS  con-
curred with our recommendation to engage stakeholders in prioritizing its key cyber
security  responsibilities.  However,  DHS  did  not  concur  with  our  recommendations
to identify and prioritize initiatives to address the challenges it faces, or to establish
performance metrics and milestones for these initiatives. Specifically, DHS reported
that its strategic plan for cyber security already provides a prioritized list, perform-
ance  measures,  and  milestones  to  guide  and  track  its  activities.  The  department
sought additional clarification of these recommendations. While we agree with DHS
that  its  plan  identifies  activities  (along  with  some  performance  measures  and  mile-
stones) that will begin to address the challenges, this plan does not include specific
initiatives that would ensure that the challenges are addressed in a prioritized and
comprehensive  manner.  For  example,  the  strategic  plan  for  cyber  security  does  not
include  initiatives  to  help  stabilize  and  build  authority  for  the  organization.  Fur-

ther,  the  strategic  plan  does  not  identify  the  relative  priority  of  its  initiatives  and
does  not  consistently  identify  performance  measures  for  completing  its  initiatives.
As  DHS  moves  forward  in  identifying  initiatives  to  address  the  underlying  chal-
lenges  it  faces,  it  will  be  important  to  establish  performance  measures  and  mile-
stones for fulfilling these initiatives.

DHS  officials  (as  well  as  others  who  were  quoted  in  our  report)  also  provided  de-
tailed  technical  corrections,  which  we  have  incorporated  in  this  report  as  appro-
priate.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The Committee will come to order.
Before  we  proceed  with  today’s  hearing,  the  Committee  must

first dispense, very briefly, with some administrative business.

I  recognize  Mr.  Gordon  to  offer  a  request  regarding  Democratic

subcommittee membership.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
By direction of the Democratic caucus of the Science Committee,
I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  ratify  the  election  of  Representative
Dennis Moore of Kansas to the Subcommittee on Research, thereby
filling one of the existing Democratic vacancies.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Without objection, so ordered.
That concludes the Committee’s organizational business.
And we will now proceed with the hearing.
And  incidentally,  I  can’t  imagine  any  hearing  any  place  on  this
Hill,  including  what  our  colleagues  in  the  Senate  are  doing  with
the  Roberts  nomination,  that  exceeds  the  importance  of  the  topic
being  discussed  here  today.  And  I  am  so  appreciative  of  the  wit-
nesses  who  have  agreed  to  share  with  us  and  enlighten  us  on  a
very important subject matter. And I want you to know how much
we  welcome  your  appearance,  because  you  are  facilitators.  We
learn  from  you.  We  like  to  think  all  Members  of  Congress,  we  are
all alike. We like to think we have got all of the answers. We don’t
even  know  some  of  the  questions.  But  I  do  know  this,  that  cyber
security is critically important. And what we are about today takes
us further down the path of dealing in a responsible way with this
very important subject.

So  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  morning’s  hearing  on
cyber security, a subject that has long been the focus of the Science
Committee.

The Nation has been making progress in developing ways to fend
off  and  respond  to  cyber  attacks.  For  example,  federal  agencies
have been implementing our Cyber Security Research and Develop-
ment Act, and when I say ‘‘our,’’ I say it proudly. That is the result
of  this  committee’s  work,  albeit  at  funding  levels  significantly
below what we would wish, and quite frankly, what is needed.

Homeland  Security  Secretary  Michael  Chertoff,  responding  to
calls  from  industry  and  the  Congress,  has  created  the  position  of
Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security. But as our witnesses today
will  make  clear,  we  still  have  a  very  long  way  to  go.  We  still  pay
inadequate  attention  to  cyber  security  research  operations  in  both
the  government  and  private  sector.  We  shouldn’t  have  to  wait  for
the cyber equivalent of Hurricane Katrina to realize that we are in-
adequately  prepared  to  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  cyber  at-
tacks.  And  a  cyber  attack  can  affect  a  far  larger  area  at  a  single
stroke than can any hurricane. Not only that, given the increasing
reliance  of  critical  infrastructures  on  the  Internet,  a  cyber  attack
could result in deaths as well as in massive, massive disruption to
our economy and daily life.

There is another lesson we should take from Katrina beyond the
need to prepare for real dangers that have not been recently expe-
rienced, and that is not to focus exclusively on terrorism. Cyber at-
tacks  could  occur  from  any  number  of  sources  and  motivations,
even  from  error,  not  just  from  foreign  or  domestic  terrorists  who
would do us harm.

So our goal this morning is to help develop a cyber security agen-
da for the Federal Government, especially to provide assistance for
the  new  Assistant  Secretary.  I  never  want  to  sit  on  a  special  com-
mittee  set  up  to  investigate  why  we  were  unprepared  for  a  cyber
attack. We know we are vulnerable. It is time to act.

And  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  and  the  guid-

ance that they might give us to do just that.

With  that,  I  am  pleased  to  recognize  my  partner,  my  colleague,

my friend, Mr. Gordon from Tennessee.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I want to welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing on cyber security, a subject

that has long been a focus of the Science Committee.

The Nation has been making progress in developing ways to fend off and respond
to  cyber  attacks.  For  example,  federal  agencies  have  been  implementing  our  Cyber
Security  Research  and  Development  Act,  albeit  at  funding  levels  significantly  below
what  we  would  wish.  Homeland  Security  Secretary  Michael  Chertoff,  responding  to
calls  from  industry  and  the  Congress,  has  created  the  position  of  Assistant  Sec-
retary for Cyber Security.

But  as  our  witnesses  today  will  make  clear,  we  still  have  a  very  long  way  to  go.
We still pay inadequate attention to cyber security research and operations in both
the government and private sector.

We  shouldn’t  have  to  wait  for  the  cyber  equivalent  of  a  Hurricane  Katrina—or
even  and  Hurricane  Ophelia  might  serve—to  realize  that  we  are  inadequately  pre-
pared to prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks.

And  a  cyber  attack  can  affect  a  far  larger  area  at  a  single  stroke  that  can  any
hurricane. Not only that, given the increasing reliance of critical infrastructures on
the Internet, a cyber attack could result in deaths as well as in massive disruption
to the economy and daily life.

There’s  another  lesson  we  should  take  from  Katrina  beyond  the  need  to  prepare
for  real  dangers  that  have  not  been  recently  experienced.  And  that  is  not  to  focus
exclusively on terrorism. Cyber attacks could occur from any number of sources and
motivations—even from error—not just from foreign or domestic terrorists.

So  our  goal  this  morning  is  to  help  develop  a  cyber  security  agenda  for  the  Fed-
eral  Government,  especially  for  the  new  Assistant  Secretary.  I  never  want  to  have
to  sit  on  a  special  committee  set  up  to  investigate  why  we  were  unprepared  for  a
cyber attack. We know we are vulnerable, it’s time to act.

I look forward to hearing our witnesses’ guidance on how to do just that.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As  usual,  I  want  to  concur  with  your  remarks,  particularly  in

context to the urgency and the seriousness of this issue.

Today’s  hearing  has  two  important  purposes:  to  assess  the
progress  in  improving  the  security  of  computer  systems  on  which
critical  industries  rely,  and  to  explore  why  progress  has  been  so
slow.

Networked  information  systems  are  key  components  of  many  of
the  Nation’s  critical  infrastructures,  including  electrical  power  dis-
tribution,  banking,  finance,  water  supply,  and  telecommunications.
Computer  system  vulnerabilities  persist  worldwide,  and  the
initiators of random cyber attacks that plague the Internet remain
largely unknown.

But  we  know  that  many  international  terrorist  groups  now  ac-
tively  use  computers  and  the  Internet  to  communicate,  and  they
are  clearly  capable  of  developing  or  acquiring  the  technical  skills
to  direct  a  coordinated  attack  against  networked  computers  in  the
United States.

The  disruptions  and  economic  damages  that  could  result  from  a
successful cyber attack to one or more of our critical infrastructures

could  be  substantial.  And  damage  to  water  supply  systems  or  to
the  chemical  processing  plants,  for  example,  could  also  create  life-
threatening consequences.

Following the events of 9/11, ensuring that security of critical in-
frastructure  has  become  a  national  priority,  but  progress  in  secur-
ing the cyber infrastructure has simply been too slow.

A  presidential  directive  from  the  Clinton  Administration,  PDD–
63,  instituted  policies  and  established  a  new  organization  to  im-
prove  the  Nation’s  ability  to  detect  and  respond  to  cyber  attacks,
including  mechanisms  to  improve  communications  between  the
public  and  the  private  sectors  regarding  cyber  security  matters.
Subsequently,  the  new  Department  of  Homeland  Security  was
charged to be the government’s focal point for cyber security.

And  yet,  in  a  report  released  this  summer,  GAO  found  that  the
Department  of  Homeland  Security  has  not  yet  developed  national
cyber threat and vulnerability assessments or government/industry
contingencies  to  recovery  plans  for  cyber  security.  This  is  simply
not good enough.

Recent events make all too clear that inadequate recovery plans,
either  by  design  or  execution,  have  dire  consequences  for  the  citi-
zens’  health  and  well  being.  Inaction  can  be  an  enemy  just  as  le-
thal as terrorists.

GAO stressed that to be successful in meeting its responsibilities,
the  Department  will  need  to  achieve  organizational  stability  for
cyber  security  activities,  including  the  elevation  of  its  function
within the Department.

In addition, GAO indicates the Department must work to develop
effective partnerships with stakeholders, and then achieve two-way
information sharing with those stakeholders.

Today, we have an opportunity to hear from some of those stake-
holders  about  what  is  being  done  within  their  industry  sectors—to
improve  cyber  security,  where  they  now  stand,  and  what  could  be
done to accelerate progress.

I  am  interested  in  hearing  about  their  relationship  to  and  inter-
actions  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  in  their
views  on  how  the  government  can  be  more  effective  in  achieving
the overall goal of cyber security for critical infrastructures.

We  need  to  understand  what  the  fundamental  impediments  are
to  securing  cyberspace  and  to  take  appropriate  action  to  overcome
them.

And  let  me  just  conclude  by  saying  this.  As  I  was  reviewing  the
briefing  material  for  this  hearing,  it  is  inevitable  that  you  look  at
it  in  context  to  Katrina.  And  some  might  say,  ‘‘Well,  the  financial
services,  you  know,  if  a  bank  in  New  Orleans  or  electrical  power
or a telecommunication outfit has several pipes that burst and they
are flooded, well, you know, at least an inconvenience, but the pri-
vate sector will come in and, through competition, will take care of
those customers.’’

But what if all of the banks, what if all of the power systems go
out  of  order?  Well,  it  goes  beyond  just  being  a  regional  concern.  It
becomes  a  national 
It  means  heartache  and
distraughtness  for  those  individuals  there,  but  for  the  American
public,  it  means  a  big  bill.  We  are  spending  $200  billion  or  more
to clean up the mess from Katrina.

You know, I don’t want to see, as the Chairman said, you know,
I  don’t  want  to  be  here  at  a  hearing  later  on  saying,  ‘‘What  went
wrong?  And  how  can  we  improve  this  thing?’’  I  mean,  the  fact  of
the  matter  is  that  when  the  price  of  gas  is  stable,  you  know,  no-
body  is  really  complaining,  but  when  it  spikes  up  and  again,  this
is  a  private  sector  matter—but  when  it  spikes  up,  the  public  says,
‘‘Where are the bums in Washington? What are you doing?’’

Well, you know, we want to get in front of this. And quite frank-
ly, after four years of Homeland Security working on this problem,
we  are  not  where  we  need  to  be,  and  we  are  not  where  we  should
be.  I  hope  that  this  will  be  an  impetus  today  to  change  that  and
to move that forward.

And  so  with  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  again  join  you  in  welcoming
these  witnesses.  This  is  an  important  hearing,  and  I  look  forward
to moving forward with it.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Today’s hearing has two important purposes: To assess progress in improving the
security  of  computer  systems  on  which  critical  industries  rely  and  to  explore  why
progress has been so slow.

Networked information systems are key components of many of the Nation’s crit-
ical  infrastructures,  including  electric  power  distribution,  banking  and  finance,
water supply, and telecommunications.

Computer  system  vulnerabilities  persist  worldwide,  and  the  initiators  of  random

cyber attacks that plague the Internet remain largely unknown.

But we know that many international terrorist groups now actively use computers
and  the  Internet  to  communicate,  and  they  are  clearly  capable  of  developing  or  ac-
quiring  the  technical  skills  to  direct  a  coordinated  attack  against  networked  com-
puters in the United States.

The  disruptions  and  economic  damages  that  could  result  from  a  successful  cyber
attack to one or more of our critical infrastructures could be substantial. And dam-
age  to  water  supply  systems  or  to  chemical  processing  plants,  for  example,  could
also create life threatening consequences.

Inaction can be an enemy just as lethal as terrorists.

We need to understand what the fundamental impediments are to securing cyber

space and to take appropriate action to overcome them.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  calling  this  hearing,  and  I  look  forward

to our discussion with the panel.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  examine  the  current  state  of  cyber  security,  how  various  critical  infrastructure
sectors  depend  on  information  systems,  and  what  is  and  should  be  done  to  secure
these systems. In addition, I am pleased today’s hearing will also explore the respec-
tive  roles  of  the  Federal  Government  and  private  sector  with  respect  to  cyber  secu-
rity.

Certain socio-economic activities are vital to the day-to-day functioning and secu-
rity  of  the  country;  for  example,  transportation  of  goods  and  people,  communica-
tions, banking and finance, and the supply and distribution of electricity and water.
Domestic security and our ability to monitor, deter, and respond to outside acts also
depend  on  some  of  these  activities  as  well  as  other  more  specialized  activities  like
intelligence gathering and command and control of police and military forces. A seri-
ous disruption in these activities and capabilities could have a major impact on the
country’s well-being.

Even  before  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  2001,  concerns  had  been  rising
among security experts about the vulnerabilities to attack of computer systems and
associated  infrastructure.  Yet,  despite  increasing  attention  from  Federal  and  State
governments  and  international  organizations,  the  defense  against  attacks  on  these
systems  has  appeared  to  be  generally  fragmented  and  varying  widely  in  effective-
ness.  Concerns  have  grown  that  what  is  needed  is  a  national  cyber  security  frame-
work—a  coordinated,  coherent  set  of  public-  and  private-sector  efforts  required  to
ensure an acceptable level of cyber security for the Nation.

While  industry  and  the  Federal  Government  have  increased  their  focus  on  cyber
security  in  recent  years,  vulnerabilities  remain,  despite  passage  of  the  Cyber  Secu-
rity Research and Development Act. The bill authorized $903 million over five years
for  new  federal  programs  to  ensure  that  the  U.S.  is  better  prepared  to  prevent  and
combat terrorist attacks on private and government computers. The legislation was
developed following a series of post-September 11, 2001 Science Committee hearings
on  the  emerging  cyber  terrorist  threat  and  the  lack  of  a  coordinated  U.S.  response.
Despite  this  legislative  and  programmatic  initiative,  our  computer  and  communica-
tions  networks,  upon  which  the  country’s  economic  and  critical  infrastructures  for
finance,  transportation,  energy  and  water  distribution,  and  health  and  emergency
services depend, are still among the Nation’s vulnerabilities.

Valid  concerns  remain  that  the  U.S.  is  still  not  appropriately  organized  and  pre-
pared  to  counter  and  respond  to  cyber  security.  Multiple  federal  agencies,  as  well
as institutions of higher education and the private sector, have critical roles to play;
yet, no enactment of or planning for the National Strategy has occurred and coordi-
nation is was lacking among agencies as they developed their research and develop-
ment  budget  requests  for  FY  2006.  The  absence  of  a  clear  advocate  for  cyber  secu-
rity at the Department of Homeland Security, coupled with the multiple senior DHS
cyber security officials leaving the department sends a clear signal to Congress that
the National Cyber Security Division does not have enough authority to work effec-
tively with the private sector. I am aware that legislation has been proposed to ele-
vate  the  head  of  the  cyber  security  office  to  the  assistant  secretary  level  to  give
cyber security more visibility within DHS and to allow higher level input to national
policy decisions, and consider this a positive step in the right direction.

I  again  thank  the  witnesses  for  being  with  us  today  and  providing  testimony  to

our committee.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member,  I  am  pleased  that  the  Science  Committee

is discussing our nation’s cyber security today.

I  appreciate  each  guest  being  here  today.  You  all  are  uniquely  qualified  to  speak
about  how  well  our  infrastructure  and  policies  are  set  up  to  handle  disruptions  or
attacks on critical information systems.

Every year, the world relies more heavily on information technology. We view our
banking accounts over the Internet, we apply for loans on-line, we even pay our bills

on-line. We manage our prescriptions on-line, and there’s not much today we DON’T
do on-line.

We hear of small- and large-scale breaches in the security of our on-line informa-
tion.  One  situation  that  comes  to  mind  is  of  a  large  bank  that  had  to  contact  all
of its members because sensitive financial information had become insecure.

Congress needs to exert leadership in the area of cyber security. Our current sys-
tem contains a patchwork of programs that represents neither an efficient nor effec-
tive coordinated federal effort.

I  am  interested  to  hear  from  today’s  witnesses  how  we  can  improve  our  current

efforts in this critical area.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back and reserve the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for hosting this hearing. Mr.
Purdy,  Mr.  Leggate,  Mr.  Freese,  Mr.  Kepler,  and  Mr.  Geisse,  thank  you  for  joining
us  today  to  discuss  the  future  cyber  security  of  our  nation.  I  am  very  interested  in
how we can improve this critical infrastructure and our nation’s security.

In  May  2005,  the  GAO  released  a  report  entitled  ‘‘Critical  Infrastructure  Protec-
tion: Challenges in Addressing Cyber Security.’’ I hope that you will touch on some
of the issues raised in this report and suggest potential options to ensure the secu-
rity  of  our  cyber  infrastructure.  Information  sharing  lapses  between  the  public  and
private  sectors  is  one  of  the  most  critical  areas  raised  by  the  GAO  study.  It  is  my
hope  that  today’s  hearing  will  help  us  understand  opportunities  for  improvement.
We are pleased to have you with us and I look forward to hearing your testimony.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Gordon,  for

those very well thought out and well reasoned arguments.

Once  again,  as  so  frequently  occurs  on  this  committee,  there  is
not  strong  disagreement.  There  is  strength  in  the  compatibility  of
our views as we go forward on a very important subject.

Part  of  the  problem  is  over  at  the  Roberts  hearing  there  are
probably  200  press  people.  You  know  how  this  announcement  of  a
hearing  on  cyber  security  is  greeted  outside  the  Committee  room?
With  a  muffled  yawn,  ‘‘Oh,  what  is  cyber  security?’’  This  is  a  very
important topic.

So let me, once again, express to all of you my deep and personal
appreciation for your willingness to be guides for those of us sitting
on this side of the witness table.

And Mr. Purdy, please relay to the Secretary our appreciation for
the  fact  that  he  has  announced  the  creation  of  the  Assistant  Sec-
retary  for  Cyber  Security  position.  I  would  hope  that  would  be
filled in a timely manner. I know attention is diverted in this crit-
ical period, in the aftermath of Katrina. All of the resources of the
Federal Government, on the domestic side, are focused on that, un-
derstandably  so.  But  that  soon  will  be  over.  We  are  on  the  way  to
recovery  and  rebuilding  one  of  the  most  important  areas  of  the
country.

Now  we  have  got  to  get  on  with  the  job  of  cyber  security.  And
I  will  say  to  my  friends  down  in  the  Administration,  particularly
those  who  have  the  heavy  responsibility  of  working  for  OMB,  the
Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  that  I  would  remind  them  that
we  passed  the  Cyber  Security  Research  and  Development  Act  in
2002. It wasn’t yesterday. It wasn’t last month. It wasn’t last year.
It was 2002.

But  unfortunately,  we  don’t  control  the  purse  strings.  So  we  can
determine the seriousness of the problem. We can provide direction
in  authorizing  funds  to  address  the  problem  in  a  comprehensive
and  meaningful  way,  but  we  don’t  control  the  purse  strings.  The

appropriators, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, do.
The people developing the budget, the people at OMB, do. And they
better  get  a  message  from  this  hearing:  this  is  a  priority  subject
and it better get the priority attention it deserves, including within
DHS  and  within  the  entire  Executive  Branch  and  the  Legislative
Branch of government.

Now  with  that,  let  me  introduce  our  panel  of  very  distinguished
witnesses:  Mr.  Donald  Purdy,  Acting  Director,  National  Cyber  Se-
curity  Division,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security;  Mr.  John
Leggate,  Chief  Information  Officer  and  Group  Vice  President,  Dig-
ital  &  Communications  Technology,  BP;  Mr.  David  Kepler,  Cor-
porate Vice President of Shared Services and Chief Information Of-
ficer,  the  Dow  Chemical  Company;  Mr.  Gerald  Freese,  Director  of
Enterprise Information Security, American Electric Power.

And  for  the  purpose  of  an  introduction,  the  Chair  is  pleased  to

recognize Mr. Akin.

Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I really appreciate this opportunity to introduce a native son
of  the  Show  Me  State,  Andy  Geisse,  the  Chief  Information  Officer
of  SBC.  Andy  grew  up  in  my  hometown  in  St.  Louis,  earned  a
Bachelor’s  degree  in  economics  and  mathematics  from  the  Univer-
sity  of  Missouri,  Columbia,  and  an  MBA  from  Washington  Univer-
sity also in St. Louis.

And  he  has  had  a  long  and  illustrious  career  with  SBC  Commu-
nications, starting back in 1979 where he began as Assistant Man-
ager in the comptroller’s department of SBC’s predecessor corpora-
tion, Southwestern Bell. He then held a variety of information tech-
nology,  sales,  and  strategic  marketing  positions,  including  serving
as the Director for Wireless Product Development for Southwestern
Bell  Mobile  Systems,  and  Vice  President  and  General  Manager  for
Southwestern  Bell  Mobile  Systems’  Oklahoma  and  West  Texas  re-
gions.

In  1995,  he  moved  to  Santiago,  Chile,  and  served  as  Vice  Presi-
dent and Chief Executive Officer of VTR Cellular. He later became
President of the Board of STARTEL Communications, the first na-
tionwide cellular company in Chile. SBC has interests in both com-
panies.

In  January  of  1998,  Andy  moved  to  New  York  as  President  and
General  Manager  of  SBC’s  Cellular  One  upstate  New  York  sub-
sidiary.  Later,  he  moved  and  became  Vice  President  of  Enterprise
and  OSS  Systems  for  SBC  and  its  subsidiaries  located  in  Cali-
fornia.  In  October  of  1999,  Andy  was  appointed  Senior  Vice  Presi-
dent, Enterprise Software Solutions, responsible for cooperate-wide
software solutions where he relocated again to San Antonio, Texas.
And boy, the mileage is piling up here, Andy.

SBC  Communications  is  an  important  and  valued  corporate  cit-
izen  of  St.  Louis  and  Missouri.  It  has  been  a  distinct  pleasure
working  with  the  fine  employees  of  SBC  to  ensure  the  citizens  of
my District receive excellent telecommunications services.

On  behalf  of  Chairman  Boehlert  and  other  Members  of  this  fine

committee, welcome to Congress, Andy. Thank you.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Wow.  That  is  quite  an  introduction.  You
know what I learned from that? It is an experience in upstate New
York that makes you a very valued member for this panel.

Mr.  AKIN.  He  has  got  something  for  everybody,  Mr.  Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Akin.
And I ask unanimous consent that our colleague, Mr. Sessions of
Texas, be permitted to sit in on this hearing. He is a very valuable
Member  of  the  entire  Congress  and  one  who  is  deeply  and  person-
ally  interested  in  the  matter  before  the  Committee.  Mr.  Sessions,
do you have anything you would care to say?

Mr.  SESSIONS.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  so  much.  It  is  good  to
be  back  over  here.  I  have  been  gone  from  the  Science  Committee
now for seven years.

Mr.  Chairman,  one  might  assume,  after  Mr.  Akin  and  myself,
that  it  is  an  Andy  Geisse  Day  in  Congress,  but  I  wanted  to  take
just a moment. He has been properly introduced by the gentleman
from  Missouri.  Mr.  Geisse  and  I  have  known  each  other  for  22
years,  during  which  time  I  have  known  Andy  and  his  family.  Dur-
ing  the  service  that  I  spent  some  two  years  as  Vice  Chairman  of
the  Cyberscience  Research  and  Development  Subcommittee  for
Homeland  Security,  I  counted  on  Andy  to  provide  information  to
me, background information that would help me to better serve not
only  this  nation,  but  also  that  committee.  And  I  am  very  happy
that  SBC  has  chosen  to  send  Mr.  Geisse  up  here.  He  is  a  dear
friend, and I think he will add a lot to today’s hearing.

And I want to thank you for allowing me to sit with you and the

Members of this committee.

I yield back the time.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Sessions.  I  do

appreciate it.

Now  to  our  witnesses.  And  the  rule  here  is  essentially  the  same
as  in  most  Committees.  We  ask  that  you  try  to  summarize  your
opening  statement  in  five  minutes  or  thereabouts.  And  I  am  usu-
ally  offended  when  I  make  that  announcement,  because  we  have
very distinguished witnesses who have so much to offer and to ask
them  to  capsulize  their  thinking  in  300  seconds  or  less  is  sort  of
unrealistic.  And  so  the  Chair  is  not  going  to  be  arbitrary.  You  are
the  only—part  of  the  only  panel  we  will  have  before  us  today,  and
you  all  have  so  much  value  to  add  to  our  knowledge  base.  So  I

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  DONALD  ‘‘ANDY’’  PURDY,  JR.,  ACTING  DI-
RECTOR,  NATIONAL  CYBER  SECURITY  DIVISION,  DEPART-
MENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Mr. PURDY. Good morning, Chairman Boehlert and distinguished
Members of the Committee. My name is Andy Purdy. I am the Act-
ing  Director  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  National
Cyber Security Division.

I  am  delighted  to  appear  before  you  to  share  the  work  of  NCSD
and  those  with  whom  we  are  partnering  to  secure  our  national
cyberspace and critical infrastructure.

Pursuant  to  President  Bush’s  Homeland  Security  Presidential
Directive  7  (HSPD–7),  our  Infrastructure  Protection  Office  devel-
oped the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) to serve as
a guide for addressing critical infrastructure and key resource pro-

tection.  It  sets  forth  a  risk  management  framework  for  public  and
private  sector  stakeholders  to  work  together  to  identify,  prioritize,
and conduct vulnerability assessments of critical assets and key re-
sources  in  each  sector.  It  also  includes  the  identification  of  inter-
dependencies  of  critical  assets  and  key  resources  both  within  and
across  sectors  as  well  as  providing  priority  protective  measures
that  owners  and  operators  of  such  assets  should  undertake  to  se-
cure them.

DHS  recognizes  that  more  than  85  percent  of  the  critical  infra-
structure  is  owned  by  the  private  sector  and  that  the  development
and enhancement of public-private partnership is paramount to se-
curing our nation’s assets.

As such, private sector-led sector coordinating councils are being
established  to  work  with  their  appropriate  sector-specific  agency
via the government coordinating councils, which represent the gov-
ernment  agencies  that  have  a  role  in  protecting  their  respective
sectors.

Our  Division  was  created  in  response  to  President  Bush’s  Na-
tional  Strategy  to  Secure  Cyberspace  as  a  national  focal  point  for
cyber  security.  Given  today’s  interconnected  environment  and  the
Department’s  integrated  risk-based  approach  to  critical  infrastruc-
ture  protection,  our  mission  is  to  work  collaboratively  with  public,
private,  and  international  entities  to  secure  cyberspace  and  Amer-
ica’s  cyber  assets.  To  meet  that  mission,  we  developed  a  strategic
plan  that  is  closely  aligned  with  the  Strategy,  HSPD–7,  the  Na-
tional  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan,  and  the  Cyber  Annex  to  the
National Response Plan.

To  carry  out  our  mission  and  related  responsibilities,  we  have
identified  two  overarching  priorities:  to  build  an  effective  National
Cyberspace Response System, and implement a cyber risk manage-
ment program for critical infrastructure protection.

A  core  component  of  our  first  priority  is  the  US–CERT  Oper-
ations  Center  that  is  a  partnership  between  the  Department  and
the  public  and  private  sectors  to  address  cyber  security  issues.  It
provides  a  national  coordination  center  that  links  public  and  pri-
vate  response  capabilities  to  facilitate  information  sharing  and  co-
ordinated  response  to  help  maintain  the  continuity  of  our  nation’s
cyber infrastructure.

We worked with the Department of Defense and the Department
of Justice to form the National Cyber Response Coordination Group
that is the principle interagency mechanism to prepare for and re-
spond  to  cyber  incidents  of  national  significance  that  was  formal-
ized in the Cyber Annex to the National Response Plan.

An important element of our response system is our ability to ad-
dress the global nature of cyberspace. Implementation of our inter-
national  cyber  security  strategy  and  its  related  outreach  and  col-
laboration objectives is well underway. Such international coopera-
tion  contributes  to  our  overall  global  situation  awareness  and  inci-
dent  response  capabilities  in  an  area  in  which  information  moves
at Internet speeds and traditional borders do not apply.

To  advance  the  second  priority  of  cyber  risk  management,  we
have  incorporated  a  risk  management  approach  aligned  with  the
interim  NIPP  into  its  effort  to  better  assess  the  threat  and  reduce
the risk to our national cyberspace. Risk management includes risk

assessment  based  on  threat,  vulnerabilities,  and  consequences  as
well  as  efforts  to  reduce  the  risk  by  addressing  vulnerabilities  be-
fore  an  attack  occurs  and  mitigating  and  managing  the  con-
sequences of a cyber attack that does occur.

Regarding  reducing  risk,  our  sector-specific  responsibilities  with-
in  the  Department,  among  others,  including  the  information  tech-
nology  sector,  which  we  are  the  lead  for,  and  the  telecommuni-
cations sector, which our partner agency, the National Communica-
tions System, is responsible for.

The NIPP also includes a cross-sector cyber responsibility for us.
In  addition  to  our  specific  responsibilities,  there  are  three  major

components of our risk mitigation approach.

First,  we  have  established  the  Internet  Disruption  Working
Group  with  the  National  Communications  System  to  address  the
resiliency and recovery of Internet functions in the case of a major
cyber  incident.  The  Department  of  Treasury  and  the  Department
of Defense are also engaged, and the working group is acting to ex-
tend  the  partnership  to  representatives  in  the  private  sector  as
well as international stakeholders.

Next,  the  interdependency  between  physical  and  cyber  infra-
structures  is  hardly  more  acute  than  in  the  use  of  control  systems
as integral operating components of many of our critical infrastruc-
tures.

Interestingly,  these  control  systems  are  implemented  with  re-
mote  access,  open  connectivity,  and  connections  to  open  networks,
such  as  corporate  intranets  and  the  Internet.  These  make  critical
infrastructure  assets  more  automated,  more  productive,  more  effi-
cient,  more  innovative,  but  they  also  may  expose  many  of  those
physical assets to physical consequences from cyber-related threats.
The  third  major  component  of  our  effort  is  the  Software  Assur-
ance  Program.  Defects  in  software  can  be  exploited  to  launch  crit-
ical  cyber  attacks,  and  we  have  developed  a  comprehensive  soft-
ware  assurance  framework  that  addresses  people,  process,  tech-
nology,  and  acquisition  through  the  software  development  process.
I  hope  we  have  the  opportunity  in  the  questions  to  discuss  our
cyber R&D agenda and our relationship with the Science and Tech-
nology  Director  to  fund  those.  We  are  committed  to  achieving  suc-
cess in our goals and objectives, but we cannot do it alone. We will
continue  to  work  with  government  and  the  private  sector  to  lever-
age  the  efforts  of  all  so  we,  as  a  Nation,  are  more  secure  in  cyber-
space and in our critical infrastructures.

Again,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today,

and I look forward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Purdy follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DONALD (ANDY) PURDY, JR.

Good  morning  Chairman  Boehlert  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee.
My name is Andy Purdy, and I am the Acting Director of the Department of Home-
land  Security’s  National  Cyber  Security  Division  (NCSD).  I  am  delighted  to  appear
before  you  today  to  share  with  you  the  work  of  the  NCSD  and  those  with  whom
we  are  partnering  to  secure  our  national  cyberspace  and  critical  infrastructure.  In
my  testimony  today,  I  will  provide  an  overview  of  NCSD,  our  operating  mandates,
our  mission  and  goals,  our  priorities,  and  the  programs  in  which  we  are  engaged
to meet those missions and goals.

DHS and Critical Infrastructure Protection

23

Over  the  course  of  the  past  several  months  Secretary  Chertoff  conducted  a  sys-
tematic evaluation of the Department’s operations. On July 13th, Secretary Chertoff
announced  his  six  point  agenda  for  the  path  ahead  for  the  Department.  As  part  of
this agenda, the Secretary announced several Departmental organizational changes.
Among  these  was  the  creation  of  a  new  Preparedness  Directorate  which  would
house a newly created office of the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Tele-
communications.  Currently,  cyber  security  is  addressed  by  the  NCSD,  one  of  four
divisions  in  the  Office  of  Infrastructure  Protection  (IP),  located  within  the  Informa-
tion Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate.

In  December  2003,  President  Bush  issued  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Direc-
tive  7:  Critical  Infrastructure  Identification,  Prioritization,  and  Protection  (HSPD–
7), which established a national policy for federal departments and agencies to iden-
tify and prioritize United States critical infrastructure and key resources and to pro-
tect them from terrorist attacks. Among other things, HSPD–7 identified 171 critical
infrastructure  and  key  resource  sectors  and  assigned  responsibility  for  each  to  a
Sector Specific Agency (SSA), with DHS serving as the overall program coordinator.
Additionally,  HSPD–7  set  forth  how  DHS  should  address  critical  infrastructure
protection, including ‘‘summary of activities to be undertaken in order to: define and
prioritize, reduce the vulnerability of, and coordinate the protection of critical infra-
structure and key resources.’’ 2

To  meet  this  mandate,  IP  developed  the  National  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan
(NIPP), a plan that is to serve as the guide for addressing critical infrastructure and
key  resource  protection.  It  sets  forth  a  risk  management  framework  for  public  and
private sector stakeholders to work together to identify, prioritize, and conduct vul-
nerability assessments of critical assets and key resources in each sector. It also in-
cludes  the  identification  of  interdependencies  of  critical  assets  and  key  resources
both within and across the sectors, as well as providing priority protective measures
that  owners  and  operators  of  such  assets  should  undertake  to  secure  them.  Recog-
nizing that more that 85 percent of the critical infrastructure is owned and operated
by the private sector and that the development of public-private partnership is para-
mount  to  securing  our  nation’s  assets,  private  sector-led  Sector  Coordinating  Coun-
cils  (SCCs)  are  being  established  to  work  with  their  appropriate  SSA  via  Govern-
ment  Coordinating  Councils,  which  represent  the  government  agencies  that  have  a
role in protecting the respective sectors.

Currently,  the  office  of  Infrastructure  Protection  is  finalizing  the  NIPP  and  it  is
expected to be released later this year. This finalized document will refine the pub-
lic-private partnership model and a process for protecting our critical infrastructures
from physical or cyber attack or natural disasters.
DHS and Cyber Security

In  June  2003,  in  response  to  the  President’s  National  Strategy  to  Secure  Cyber-
space  and  HSPD–7,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  created  the  NCSD  as  a
national  focal  point  for  cyber  security.  The  national  strategy  established  the  fol-
lowing five national priorities for securing cyberspace:

Priority I:
Priority II:

Priority III:

Priority IV:
Priority V:

A National Cyberspace Security Response System
A National Cyberspace Security Threat and Vulnerability Re-
duction Program
A National Cyberspace Security Awareness and Training Pro-
gram
Securing Government’s Cyberspace
National Security and International Cyberspace Security Co-
operation

1 The  NIPP  identifies  the  following  Critical  Infrastructure  Sectors  and  Key  Resources:  Food
and  Agriculture;  Public  Health  and  Health  Care;  Drinking  Water  and  Wastewater;  Energy;
Banking  and  Finance;  National  Monuments  and  Icons;  Defense  Industrial  Base;  Information
Technology; Telecommunications; Chemical; Transportation Systems; Emergency Services; Post-
al  and  Shipping;  Dams;  Government  Facilities;  Commercial  Facilities;  Nuclear  Reactors,  Mate-
rials, and Waste.

Given  today’s  interconnected  environment  and  DHS’s  integrated  risk-based  ap-
proach  to  critical  infrastructure  protection,  NCSD’s  mission  is  to  work  collabo-
ratively  with  public,  private,  and  international  entities  to  secure  cyberspace  and
America’s cyber assets. To meet that mission, NCSD developed a Strategic Plan that
establishes a set of goals with specific objectives for each goal, and milestones asso-
ciated  with  each  objective.  The  Strategic  Plan  goals,  which  are  closely  aligned  with
the  Strategy,  HSPD–7,  the  NIPP,  and  the  Cyber  Annex  to  the  National  Response
Plan, are as follows:

1. Establish  a  National  Cyberspace  Response  System  to  prevent,  detect,  re-

spond to, and reconstitute rapidly after cyber incidents;

2. Work with public and private sector representatives to reduce vulnerabilities

and minimize severity of cyber attacks;

3. Promote  a  comprehensive  awareness  plan  to  empower  all  Americans  to  se-

cure their own parts of cyberspace;

4. Foster  adequate  training  and  education  programs  to  support  the  Nation’s

cyber security needs;

5. Coordinate  with  the  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  communities  to  iden-

tify and reduce threats to cyberspace; and

6. Build a world class organization that aggressively advances its cyber security

mission and goals in partnership with its public and private stakeholders.

To  meet  these  goals,  NCSD  is  organized  into  four  operating  branches  to  address
the various aspects of the risk management structure: (1) U.S. Computer Emergency
Readiness Team (US–CERT) Operations to manage the 24–7 threat watch, warning,
and  response  capability  that  can  identify  emerging  threats  and  vulnerabilities  and
coordinate  responses  to  major  cyber  incidents;  (2)  Strategic  Initiatives  Branch  to
manage activities to advance cyber security in critical infrastructure protection, con-
trol  systems  security,  software  development,  training  and  education,  exercises,  and
standards  and  best  practices;  (3)  Outreach  and  Awareness  Branch  to  manage  out-
reach, cyber security awareness, and partnership efforts to disseminate information
to  key  constituencies  and  build  collaborative  actions  with  key  stakeholders;  and  (4)
Law  Enforcement  and  Intelligence  Branch  to  coordinate  and  share  information  be-
tween these communities and NCSD’s other constituents in the private sector, pub-
lic  sector,  academia,  and  others,  and  also  to  coordinate  interagency  response  and
mitigation  of  cyber  security  incidents.  Together,  these  branches  make  up  NCSD’s
framework  to  address  the  cyber  security  challenges  across  our  key  stakeholder
groups  and  build  communications,  collaboration,  and  awareness  to  further  our  col-
lective capabilities to detect, recognize, attribute, respond to, mitigate, and reconsti-
tute after cyber attacks.
Cyber Security Priorities: Response and Risk Management

The  Strategy,  HSPD–7,  and  the  NIPP  provide  NCSD  with  a  clear  operating  mis-
sion  and  national  coordination  responsibility.  To  carry  out  this  mission  and  its  re-
lated responsibilities, NCSD has identified two overarching priorities: to build an ef-
fective national cyberspace response system and to implement a cyber risk manage-
ment program for critical infrastructure protection. Our focus on these two priorities
and  related  programs  addresses  the  overarching  NIPP  Risk  Management  method-
ology and establishes the framework for securing cyberspace today and a foundation
for addressing cyber security for the future.
Priority 1—Cyber Incident Management: A National Cyberspace Response System

A core component of NCSD and our effort to establish a National Cyberspace Re-
sponse  System  is  the  US–CERT  Operations  Center.  US–CERT  was  established  in
September  2003  as  a  partnership  between  DHS  and  the  public  and  private  sectors
to address cyber security issues. Building upon an initial partnership with the Com-
puter Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC) in Carnegie Mel-
lon University’s Software Engineering Institute, US–CERT now provides a national
coordination  center  that  links  public  and  private  response  capabilities  to  facilitate
information  sharing  across  all  infrastructure  sectors  and  to  help  protect  and  main-
tain  the  continuity  of  our  nation’s  cyber  infrastructure.  The  overarching  approach
to this task is to facilitate and implement systemic global and domestic coordination
of deterrence from, preparation for, defense against, response to, and recovery from
cyber incidents and attacks across the United States, as well as from the cyber con-
sequences of physical attacks or natural disasters.

US–CERT  has  four  major  programs  of  activity.  First,  US–CERT  is  DHS’s  24–7–
365 cyber watch, warning, and incident response center, and it provides coordinated
response  to  cyber  incidents,  a  web  portal  for  secure  communications  with  private

and  public  sector  stakeholders,  including  critical  infrastructure  owners  and  opera-
tors,  a  daily  report,  a  public  website  (http://www.us-cert.gov/),  and  a  National
Cyber  Alert  System,  which  provides  timely,  actionable  information  to  the  public  on
both  technical  and  non-technical  bases.  Second,  US–CERT  conducts  malicious  code
analysis, provides malware technical support, and conducts cyber threat and vulner-
ability analysis. Third, US–CERT manages a situational awareness program and an
Internet  Health  and  Status  service  used  by  50  government  agency  computer  secu-
rity incident response teams. Fourth, US–CERT manages programs for communica-
tion  and  collaboration  among  public  agencies  and  key  network  defense  service  pro-
viders.  In  line  with  NCSD’s  close  working  relationship  with  NCS,  US–CERT  works
closely with the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications (NCC) to ad-
dress  and  mitigate  cyber  threats  including  response  and  recovery.  US–CERT  also
maintains a presence in the HSOC to ensure coordination throughout DHS.

As  noted,  NCSD  has  initiated  a  number  of  activities  specifically  to  assist  federal
agencies in protecting their cyber infrastructure. NCSD established the Government
Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (GFIRST) to facilitate interagency
information  sharing  and  cooperation  across  federal  agencies  for  readiness  and  re-
sponse  efforts.  GFIRST  is  a  group  of  technical  and  tactical  practitioners  of  security
response  teams  responsible  for  securing  government  information  technology  sys-
tems. The members work together to understand and handle computer security inci-
dents  and  to  encourage  proactive  and  preventative  security  practices.  The  purpose
of the GFIRST is to:

guidance;

• Provide  members  with  technical  information,  tools,  methods,  assistance,  and
• Coordinate proactive liaison activities and analytical support;
• Further the development of quality products and services for the Federal Gov-
• Share specific technical details regarding incidents within a trusted U.S. Gov-
• Improve incident response operations.

ernment environment on a peer-to-peer basis; and

ernment;

GFIRST  meets  on  a  regular  basis  and  held  its  first  annual  conference  in  April
2005  with  more  than  200  participants  from  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments.
The conference was a major success for US–CERT, and GFIRST has established fur-
ther  lines  of  communications  across  organizations.  The  technical  workshops  and
speakers stimulated many technical interchanges regarding cyber first responder ac-
tivities.  In  another  step  forward,  GFIRST  held  its  first  classified  threat  briefing
with  DHS  Office  of  Information  Analysis  (IA),  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency,  De-
partment of Defense, and National Security Agency in June 2005.

US–CERT  utilizes  a  secure  collaboration  platform,  the  US–CERT  Portal,  to  sup-
port  cyber  information  sharing  and  collaboration  among  the  GFIRST  community,
and  other  cyber  and  critical  infrastructure  communities,  such  as  the  ISACs.  The
US–CERT  Portal  is  being  integrated  into  the  Homeland  Security  Information  Net-
work  (HSIN)  and  bridges  the  gap  between  the  Government  Coordinating  Councils,
the  Sector  Coordinating  Councils,  ISACs,  and  other  private  critical  infrastructure
information-sharing entities.

In addition to GFIRST, NCSD worked with the Department of Defense (DOD) and
the Department of Justice (DOJ) to form the National Cyber Response Coordination
Group (NCRCG) to provide a Federal Government approach to coordinated cyber in-
cident  response.  NCSD  created  a  Cyber  Annex  to  the  recently  issued  National  Re-
sponse  Plan  (NRP)3 that  provides  a  framework  for  responding  to  cyber  incidents  of
national significance. As such, the Cyber Annex formalized the NCRCG as the prin-
cipal federal interagency mechanism to coordinate preparation for, and response to,
cyber  incidents  of  national  significance.  The  co-chairs  of  the  NCRCG  are  DHS/
NCSD, DOJ, and DOD. An additional 13 federal agencies with a statutory responsi-
bility  for  and/or  specific  capability  toward  cyber  security,  including  the  intelligence
community,  comprise  the  membership.  NCSD  serves  as  the  Executive  Agent  and
point of contact for the NCRCG. The NCRCG has developed a concept of operations
(CONOPS)  for  national  cyber  incident  response  that  will  be  examined  in  the  Na-
tional  Cyber  Exercise,  Cyber  Storm,  to  be  conducted  by  NCSD  in  November  2005,
with public and private sector stakeholders.

The NCRCG is also reviewing capabilities of federal agencies from a cyber defense
perspective  to  better  leverage  and  coordinate  the  preparation  for  and  response  to
significant cyber incidents. This effort will entail the following components:

age to maximize interagency coordination of cyber defense capabilities;

• Mapping  the  current  capabilities  of  government  agencies  related  to  cyber  de-
fense relative to detection and recognition of cyber activity of concern, attribu-
tion, response and mitigation, and reconstitution;
• Identifying  capabilities  within  the  government  that  US–CERT  should  lever-
• Performing a gap analysis to identify the surge capabilities for possible lever-
age by, or collaboration with, the US–CERT for cyber defense issues in order
to  detect  potentially  damaging  activity  in  cyberspace,  to  analyze  exploits  and
warn potential victims, to coordinate incident responses, and to restore essen-
tial services that have been damaged; and
• Consider  establishing  formal  resource  sharing  agreements  with  the  other
agencies per the cyber defense coordination needs identified through the proc-
ess identified above.

An  important  element  of  a  National  Cyberspace  Response  System  is  our  ability
to address the global nature of cyberspace. Implementation of NCSD’s international
cyber  security  strategy  and  its  related  outreach  and  collaboration  objectives  is  well
underway, as we participate in bilateral and multilateral outreach efforts and have
established  cooperative  programs  with  key  allies  and  countries  of  interest.  Such
international cooperation contributes to our overall global situational awareness and
incident  response  capabilities  in  an  area  in  which  information  moves  at  Internet
speed and traditional borders do not apply.

With  our  efforts,  accomplishments,  and  on-going  programs,  NCSD  has  made  sig-
nificant  progress  in  managing  cyber  incidents  and  has  taken  substantial  strides  to-
ward  building  a  National  Cyberspace  Response  System.  We  know  there  is  more  to
do, and we are enhancing and evolving our readiness and response programs to fur-
ther our efforts and address this dynamic environment.
Priority 2—Cyber Risk Management: Assessing the Threat and Reducing the Risk

NCSD  incorporated  a  risk  management  approach  aligned  with  HSPD–7  and  the
resulting interim NIPP into its effort to better assess the threat and reduce the risk
to  our  national  cyberspace.  Risk  management  includes  risk  assessment  based  on
threat, vulnerabilities, and consequences, as well as efforts to reduce the risk by ad-
dressing  vulnerabilities  before  an  attack  occurs,  and  mitigating  and  managing  the
consequences  of  a  cyber  attack  that  does  occur.  The  NIPP  risk  management  frame-
work  entails  work  with  the  intelligence  community,  law  enforcement,  and  the  pri-
vate sector to better understand the cyber threat and a collaborative partnership be-
tween  the  private  sector  and  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments  looking  at  peo-
ple,  cyber,  and  physical  assets  to  identify  and  prioritize  those  assets,  assess
vulnerabilities,  and  coordinate  the  protection  of  critical  infrastructure  and  key  re-
sources.

With regard to assessing the threat, NCSD collaborates with the law enforcement
and  the  intelligence  communities  in  a  number  of  ways.  DHS  assisted  in  the  coordi-
nation of cyber-related issues for the ‘‘National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) of Cyber
Threats  to  the  U.S.  Information  Infrastructure.’’  The  resulting  classified  document
issued  in  February  2004  details  actors  (nation  states,  terrorist  groups,  organized
criminal  groups,  hackers,  etc.),  capabilities,  and  intent  (where  known).  In  addition,
NCSD  has  infused  cyber  requirements  into  the  Standing  Information  Needs  (SINs)
and Priority Information Needs (PINs) for the intelligence community and continues
to  collaborate  with  them  through  IA  to  characterize  cyber  threats  for  accuracy.  Fi-
nally, the NCRCG includes law enforcement and intelligence agencies and has work-
ing groups addressing botnets and attribution issues.

The  private  sector  is  also  a  resource  for  threat  and  risk  related  information,  and
NCSD  works  with  its  industry  stakeholders  to  gather  and  communicate  that  infor-
mation.  The  US–CERT  Internet  Health  Service  enables  US–CERT  to  gather  infor-
mation from private sector resources regarding vulnerabilities, network attacks, and
malicious code activity and provide that information to federal agencies. In addition,
NCSD has identified preparedness and response as a key area of joint public-private
effort and is working with the critical infrastructure sectors to identify attack/threat
scenarios  against  which  proactive  protective  measures  can  be  taken  and  response
plans  can  be  developed.  And,  DHS  utilizes  the  ISACs  and  critical  sector  elements
of the HSIN to obtain and share cyber security information.

With  regard  to  reducing  the  risk,  DHS’s  SSA  responsibilities  under  the  NIPP  in-
clude  the  Information  Technology  (IT)  Sector  and  the  Telecommunications  Sector.
Specifically,  NCSD  coordinates  the  IT  Sector,  and  the  National  Communications
System  (NCS),  another  of  the  divisions  in  the  IP  directorate,  coordinates  the  Tele-
communications  Sector.  Reflecting  the  increasing  convergence  between  these  two
communications sectors in today’s market, NCSD and NCS work together closely to

coordinate  all  efforts  to  protect  the  Nation’s  critical  cyber  systems  and  the  tele-
communications transport layer.

The  NIPP  includes  a  cross-sector  cyber  responsibility  for  NCSD  in  addition  to  its
IT Sector responsibility. The cross-sector responsibility is the collaborative effort be-
tween DHS/NCSD and the SSAs to ensure that deployed cyber elements have been
secured  in  an  appropriate  and  consistent  manner  across  sectors.  NCSD  is  respon-
sible for providing cyber guidance to all sectors assisting them in understanding and
mitigating  cyber  risk  (including  cyber  infrastructure  vulnerabilities)  and  in  devel-
oping effective and appropriate protective measures. This guidance includes contrib-
uting cyber elements to the NIPP, reviewing the cyber aspects of the respective Sec-
tor  Specific  Plans  (SSPs),  and  delivering  cyber  Critical  Infrastructure  Protection
(CIP) training to SSAs to help them enhance the cyber aspects of their SSPs.

To implement these two NIPP Cyber elements, NCSD works with the Information
Technology  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Center  (IT–ISAC)  and  the  newly  es-
tablished  Information  Technology  Sector  Coordination  Council  (IT–SCC),  as  well  as
with the SSAs, ISACs and emerging SCCs in the other sectors.

In addition to NCSD’s specific NIPP responsibilities, there are three major compo-
nents to our cyber risk mitigation approach: the Internet Disruption Working Group
(IDWG),  the  Control  Systems  Security  Program,  and  the  Software  Assurance  Pro-
gram.

Protection  of  critical  cyber  assets  goes  hand-in-hand  with  protection  of  critical
telecommunications  assets;  accordingly,  NCSD  and  NCS  are  working  closely  to-
gether  to  collaborate  on  issues  related  to  threats,  identification  of  critical  cyber  as-
sets, vulnerability and risk assessments, and development of appropriate protective
measures  that  could  be  recommended  for  implementation  by  owners/operators.
Within  the  NIPP  framework,  NCSD  and  NCS  established  the  Internet  Disruption
Working Group (IDWG) in December 2004 to address the resiliency and recovery of
Internet  functions  in  case  of  a  major  cyber  incident.  The  Department  of  Treasury
and  the  Department  of  Defense  are  also  engaged,  and  the  working  group  is  acting
to extend the partnership to representatives from the private sector as well as inter-
national  stakeholders.  The  IDWG  reflects  the  convergence  of  telecommunications
and  information  technology  sectors  in  today’s  environment  and  the  emergence  of
Next  Generation  Networks  (NGN)  that  will  compose  the  Internet  of  the  future.  An
initial  focus  of  the  working  group  is  to  identify  near-term  actions  related  to  situa-
tional  awareness,  protection,  and  response  that  government  and  its  stakeholders
can  take  to  better  prepare  for,  protect  against,  and  mitigate  nationally  significant
Internet disruptions.

The  interdependency  between  physical  and  cyber  infrastructures  is  hardly  more
acute than in the use of control systems as integral operating components by many
of  our  critical  infrastructures.  ‘‘Control  Systems’’  is  a  generic  term  applied  to  hard-
ware, firmware, communications, and software used to perform vital monitoring and
controlling  functions  of  sensitive  processes  and  enable  automation  of  physical  sys-
tems.  Specific  control  systems  used  in  the  various  critical  infrastructure  sectors  in-
clude  Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA)  systems,  Process  Control
Systems (PCS), and Distributed Control Systems (DCS).

Examples  of  the  critical  infrastructure  processes  and  functions  that  control  sys-
tems  monitor  and  control  include  energy  transmission  and  distribution,  pipelines,
water  and  pumping  stations,  telecommunications,  chemical  processing,  pharma-
ceutical production, rail and light rail, manufacturing, and food production. Increas-
ingly, these control systems are implemented with remote access, open connectivity,
and  connections  to  open  networks  such  as  corporate  intranets  and  the  Internet.
These  sophisticated  information  technology  tools  are  making  our  critical  infrastruc-
ture  assets  more  automated,  more  productive,  more  efficient,  and  more  innovative,
but  they  also  may  expose  many  of  those  physical  assets  to  physical  consequences
from new, cyber-related threats and vulnerabilities.

To  assure  immediate  attention  is  directed  to  protect  these  systems,  NCSD  estab-
lished  the  Control  Systems  Security  Program  to  coordinate  efforts  among  Federal,
State, and local governments, as well as control system owners, operators, and ven-
dors to improve control system security within and across all critical infrastructure
sectors.  As  part  of  this  Program,  NCSD  developed  a  Control  Systems  Strategy  that
incorporates five highly integrated goals to address the issues and challenges associ-
ated  with  control  systems  security.  As  such,  our  control  systems  activities  support
NCSD’s overall efforts to address cyber security across critical infrastructure sectors
over  the  long-term,  as  well  as  the  US–CERT’s  capability  in  the  management,  re-
sponse,  and  handling  of  incidents,  vulnerabilities,  and  mitigation  of  threat  actions
specific  to  critical  control  systems  functions.  NCSD  also  recognizes  the  significant
attention being paid to PCS and SCADA security by various industry organizations

in  developing  encryption  standards,  cryptography,  modeling,  and  other  tools  to  im-
prove cyber security of control systems.

NCSD also established the US–CERT Control Systems Security Center (CSSC) in
partnership with Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and other Department of Energy
National  Laboratories4 in  June  2004.  The  CSSC  is  involving  other  partners  from
control systems industry associations, universities, control systems vendors, and in-
dustry  experts.  Since  its  establishment,  the  CSSC  has  made  considerable  progress
and some of its major accomplishments include:

• Established the US–CERT CSSC assessment and incident response facility lo-
cated  at  INL  and  a  US–CERT  Support  Operations  Center  for  Control  Sys-
tems;
• Established  relationships  with  more  than  25  potential  industry  partners  and
completed  several  agreements  that  established  initial  assessment,  analysis,
and vulnerability reduction plans within various industry sectors;
• Created  the  Critical  Infrastructure  Cyber  Consequence  Matrix  to  determine
the  industries  of  most  concern,  and  a  list  of  specific  sites  from  the  National
Asset  Database  where  Control  Systems  could  cause  a  negative  consequence
due to failure or attack;
• Created  a  quantitative  control  systems  cyber  risk/decision  analysis  measure-
• Established  the  Process  Control  System  Forum  (PCSF)  (in  partnership  with
DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate) with industry, academia, and gov-
ernment to accelerate the development of technology that will enhance the se-
curity,  safety,  and  reliability  of  Control  Systems,  including  legacy  installa-
tions.

ment methodology; and,

At  the  same  time  that  the  telecommunications  and  financial  sectors  have  in-
creased their dependence on information systems overall for information flows, serv-
ice provision, and financial transactions, the energy, chemical, nuclear, food and ag-
riculture, transportation, and water sectors have become increasingly dependent on
process control systems for their critical operations. To more fully utilize the Matrix
for analysis on the nature of consequences of attacks on the various sectors for risk
management purposes, more information is needed about how these various sectors
are using process control systems and the subsequent interdependencies.

Future  FY05  and  FY06  activities  for  NCSD’s  Control  Systems  Security  Program

include efforts to:

owners and operators;

• Develop  a  comprehensive  set  of  control  systems  security  assurance  levels  for
• Sponsor government/industry workshops to increase awareness among control

• Develop the US–CERT CSSC web page for information exchange.

tools to provide response teams a web-based application to assess impacts;

vulnerabilities and recommendations to protect against cyber threats; and

The  third  major  component  of  NCSD’s  cyber  risk  management  program  is  our
Software  Assurance  Program.  Software  is  an  essential  component  of  the  Nation’s
critical  infrastructure  (power,  water,  transportation,  financial  institutions,  defense
industrial  base,  etc);  however,  defects  in  software  can  be  exploited  to  launch  cyber
attacks  as  well  as  attacks  against  the  critical  infrastructure.  NCSD  developed  a
comprehensive  software  assurance  framework  that  addresses  people,  process,  tech-
nology, and acquisition throughout the software development lifecycle.

As  part  of  the  shared  responsibility  approach  to  cyber  security,  DHS  is  working
to  achieve  a  broader  ability  to  routinely  develop  and  deploy  trustworthy  software
products. As such, DHS is shifting the security paradigm from ‘‘patch management’’
to ‘‘software assurance’’ by encouraging U.S. software developers to raise the bar on
software  quality  and  security.  In  collaboration  with  other  federal  agencies,  aca-
demia, and the private sector, we are:

• Sponsoring  the  development  of  a  repository  of  best  practices  and  practical

guidance for the software development community;

ment.

DHS  will  seek  to  reduce  risks  by  raising  the  level  of  trust  for  all  software,  mini-
mizing vulnerabilities and understanding threats. DHS will collaborate with govern-
ment, industry, academic institutions, and international allies to achieve these soft-
ware assurance objectives.

Another  important  cyber  element  of  national  infrastructure  protection  is  the  pro-
liferation of the Internet in our society and daily lives. To mitigate the risks inher-
ent  in  the  rapidly  growing  user  base  and  increasing  usage,  NCSD  is  engaged  in  a
cyber security awareness program that leverages a variety of partners including the
National  Cyber  Security  Alliance,  the  Multi-State  ISAC,  and  the  Federal  Trade
Commission,  among  others,  to  reach  out  to  the  home  user,  K–12,  small  business,
and  higher  education  audiences  to  raise  the  American  public’s  awareness  of  cyber
risks and security measures.
Research  and  Development  for  Cyber  Security  and  Critical  Infrastructure

Protection

Cyber-related research and development (R&D) is vital to improving the resiliency
of  the  Nation’s  critical  infrastructures.  This  difficult  strategic  challenge  requires  a
coordinated and focused effort from across the Federal Government, State and local
governments,  the  private  sector,  and  academia  to  advance  the  security  of  critical
cyber systems.

A  critical  area  of  focus  for  DHS  is  the  development  and  deployment  of  tech-
nologies  to  protect  the  Nation’s  cyber  infrastructure,  including  the  Internet  and
other critical infrastructures that depend on IT systems for their mission. Two com-
ponents  within  DHS  share  responsibility  for  cyber  R&D,  with  the  Science  &  Tech-
nology  (S&T)  Directorate  serving  as  the  primary  agent  responsible  for  executing
cyber security R&D programs. NCSD has responsibility for developing requirements
for DHS’ cyber security R&D projects.

The  S&T  Directorate’s  mission  is  to  conduct,  stimulate,  and  enable  research,  as
well  as  to  develop,  test,  evaluate,  and  transition  homeland  security  capabilities  to
federal,  State  and  local  operational  end-users.  The  goals  of  the  DHS  S&T  Direc-
torate’s Cyber Security R&D program are to:

nologies and to ensure the security of new emerging systems;

• Perform  R&D  aimed  at  improving  the  security  of  existing  deployed  tech-
• Develop  new  and  enhanced  technologies  for  the  detection  of,  prevention  of,
and  response  to  cyber  attacks  on  the  Nation’s  critical  information  infrastruc-
ture; and
• Facilitate  the  transfer  of  these  technologies  into  the  national  infrastructure

as a matter of urgency.

NCSD supports the overall DHS R&D mission by identifying areas for cyber inno-
vation and coordinating with S&T. NCSD collects, develops, and submits cyber secu-
rity  R&D  requirements  to  provide  input  to  the  federal  cyber  security  R&D  commu-

5 The  National  Information  Assurance  Partnership,  established  in  August  of  1997,  is  a  joint
effort  between  NIST  and  NSA  to  provide  technical  leadership  in  security-related  information
technology test methods and assurance techniques. NIAP uses the Common Criteria to evaluate
and  certify  commercial  off  the  shelf  (COTS)  products.  There  has  been  much  discussion  in  past
years on the effectiveness (time and cost) of the NIAP process. As a result, the National Strategy
to Secure Cyberspace recommended an independent review of the program be conducted to make
recommendations for its improvement.

nity  and  specifically  to  inform  the  DHS  S&T  Directorate’s  cyber  security  research
priorities.

DHS  S&T’s  Cyber  Security  Research  and  Development  Center  is  currently  work-
ing  on  several  projects  that  support  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Strategy
to  Secure  Cyberspace,  while  addressing  the  vulnerabilities  of  critical  systems  and
infrastructures. The major areas are:

• Working  with  industry  to  develop  secure  routing  protocols  for  the  core  of  the

• Development of a cyber security test bed for researchers and developers.
• Establishment  of  a  large  database  of  anonymized  data  collected  from  the

threats.

To  support  and  document  cyber  security  R&D  initiatives  across  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment,  NCSD  participates  in  the  Cyber  Security  and  Information  Assurance
Interagency  Working  Group  (CSIA  IWG),  co-chaired  by  S&T  and  the  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP).  Participants  include  the  National  Science
Foundation  (NSF),  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA),  the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and many others. By report-
ing  to  both  the  Infrastructure  Subcommittee  and  NITRD,  the  CSIA  IWG  is  posi-
tioned to coordinate cyber security and information assurance R&D across agencies,
while ensuring that the security of critical infrastructures is emphasized. The CSIA
IWG is currently completing the Federal Cyber Security and Information Assurance
R&D Plan.
Moving Forward

In connection with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, efforts are under-
way  to  assess  cyber  threats,  reduce  vulnerabilities  and  identify  significant  inter-
dependencies.  These  efforts  will  be  fully  implemented  as  the  SSAs  implement  their
portion  of  the  NIPP.  In  partnership  with  NCS  and  other  agencies,  we  are  working
through the Internet Disruption Working Group to address the resiliency and recov-
ery of Internet functions in the case of a major cyber incident. We have established
a  Control  Systems  Security  Program  to  address  core  operating  systems  of  critical
infrastructure  sectors.  And,  we  are  working  with  the  government,  private  sector,
and academia to promote the integrity and security of software. We continue to en-
hance our cyber incident readiness and response system, and we coordinate with our
private  sector  stakeholders  to  provide  protective  guidance  to  our  stakeholders
through  US–CERT.  We  are  conducting  a  major  exercise  later  this  year  to  test  the
Cyber  Annex  to  the  National  Response  Plan.  Through  this  effort,  we  will  pull  to-
gether appropriate entities in the Federal Government, State governments, and ap-
propriate  private  sector  stakeholders  to  test  our  capabilities  and,  subsequently,  to
improve our incident management process.

We  are  committed  to  achieving  success  in  meeting  our  goals  and  objectives,  but
we  cannot  do  it  alone.  We  will  continue  to  meet  with  industry  representatives,  our
government  counterparts,  academia,  and  State  representatives  to  formulate  the
partnerships  needed  for  productive  collaboration  and  leverage  the  efforts  of  all,  so
we,  as  a  nation,  are  more  secure  in  cyberspace  and  in  our  critical  infrastructures.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I would be happy

to answer any questions you may have at this time.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DONALD A. (ANDY) PURDY, JR.

In  October  2004,  Donald  A.  (Andy)  Purdy,  Jr.  was  appointed  by  Secretary  Ridge
as  the  Acting  Director  of  the  National  Cyber  Security  Division  (NCSD)  for  the  De-
partment of Homeland Security, within the Information Analysis and Infrastructure
Protection  (IAIP)  Directorate.  The  IAIP  Directorate  identifies  and  assesses  a  broad
range  of  intelligence  information  concerning  threats  to  the  people  and  communities

of  the  United  States  and  to  protect  the  critical  infrastructure  systems  vital  to  our
national  security,  governance,  public  health  and  safety,  economy,  and  national  mo-
rale.

The  NCSD’s  mission,  in  cooperation  with  public,  private,  and  international  enti-
ties, is to secure cyberspace and America’s cyber assets. The key components of this
mission  involve:  (1)  implementation  of  the  National  Strategy  to  Secure  Cyberspace
and the DHS Strategic Plan; and (2) implementation of priority protective measures
to secure cyberspace and to reduce the cyber vulnerabilities of America’s critical in-
frastructures.

Prior  to  joining  the  Department,  Mr.  Purdy  worked  on  assignment  to  the  White
House  as  Deputy  to  the  Vice  Chair  and  Senior  Advisor  for  IT  Security  and  Privacy
to  the  President’s  Critical  Infrastructure  Protection  Board  (PCIPB)  working  on  the
development of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. With the PCIPB, Purdy
worked in the areas of cyber crime, privacy protection, government procurement and
maintenance  of  more  secure  products  and  systems,  security  of  the  financial  sector’s
information systems, and in promoting information sharing in industry sectors such
as health care and finance. In April 2003, Mr. Purdy came to the Department where
he  worked  on  the  cyber  tiger  team  to  help  design  and  launch  the  NCSD  in  June
2003.  Following  that  he  served  as  Acting  Director  until  Amit  Yoran  was  appointed
Director in the Fall of 2003.

Immediately  prior  to  his  assignment  to  the  White  House  staff,  Mr.  Purdy  served
as  Chief  Deputy  General  Counsel  and  later  as  Acting  General  Counsel  for  the  U.S.
Sentencing  Commission.  The  Sentencing  Commission  is  charged  with  promulgating
and  updating  the  Federal  Sentencing  Guidelines  for  individuals  and  organizations,
and for providing counsel to the Congress and others about federal sentencing prac-
tices  and  policies.  At  the  Sentencing  Commission  Mr.  Purdy  served  as  a  member
of  the  senior  management  team  and  provided  legal,  strategic,  administrative,  and
ethical advice to the Chair and Commissioners, Staff Director and Unit Chiefs.

Mr.  Purdy  graduated  from  the  College  of  William  and  Mary  and  the  University
of Virginia Law School. After receiving his law degree, Purdy served as an Assistant
Attorney  General  in  Missouri,  and  then  as  Senior  Staff  Counsel  to  the  U.S.  House
of  Representatives  Select  Committee  on  Assassinations’  investigation  of  the  assas-
sination  of  President  Kennedy.  He  subsequently  served  as  an  Assistant  U.S.  Attor-
ney  in  Philadelphia  where  he  concentrated  on  investigating  and  prosecuting  white
collar  crime.  Following  his  service  as  a  federal  prosecutor,  Mr.  Purdy  returned  to
Washington,  D.C.  to  serve  as  Counsel  to  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  Com-
mittee on Standards of Official Conduct (Ethics).

Mr. Purdy then moved to investigative work in network news, working as an As-
sociate Producer for the NBC News magazines First Camera and Monitor, and then
as the Producer for News and Politics for the CBS News broadcast NIGHTWATCH.
Subsequently, while at the Sentencing Commission, Mr. Purdy was detailed to Cap-
itol  Hill  where  he  worked  as  Counsel  to  the  U.S.  Senate  Impeachment  Trial  Com-
mittee  for  the  impeachment  trial  of  then-chief  federal  judge  Walter  Nixon  of  Mis-
sissippi.

Mr.  Purdy  lives  in  Bethesda,  Maryland,  with  his  wife  Robin  Fader,  an  Emmy
Award winning television and commercial producer, and their daughter, Alexandra,
who is 10 years old and has a certified black belt in Tae Kwon Do.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Purdy.

Mr.  LEGGATE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you,  distin-

guished Members.

My  name  is  John  Leggate.  I  am  CIO  for  BP,  and  this  morning,
I  also  represent  BENS,  which  is  Business  Executives  for  National
Security in the U.S., a large organization whose interest, of course,
is  improving  the  nature  of  business  and  its  dependency  on  the
Internet.

By  way  of  context,  also,  BP  happens  to  be  the  biggest  provider
of oil and gas in the United States. So, in fact, in our normal busi-

ness,  we  take  the  whole  issue  of  national  security  as  a  very,  very
fundamental part of what we do for the United States.

32

Anyway,  going  on  from  that,  this  topic,  as  you  said,  Mr.  Chair-
man,  has  actually  been  in  our  minds  for  some  time.  It  has  been
around,  and  I  think  what  I  would  like  to  do  here  is  point  to  two
things just to simply portray a little bit more of why this is so im-
portant  today  and  a  few  ideas  on  the  way  forward  above  and  be-
yond what is said here.

Almost  by  stealth  since  the  fail  of  the  dot-com  era  companies
have actually been moving towards the Net progressively. We have
done  survey  work,  and  our  most  recent  survey  would  say,  in  the
energy sector, the chemicals and transport sector, up to 30 percent
of their revenues come from work done on the Internet today in the
United  States.  In  a  sense,  the  dependency  is  very  clear  and  grow-
ing.

And the second point, after Mr. Purdy’s point, the nature of busi-
ness  automation  regarding  running  process  plants,  refineries,  and
chemical plants are now moving to a place where they look simply
like  regular  computers.  They  are  not  different  systems  anymore.
And the capacity for these systems then to be impaired is quite im-
portant. In fact, with time, we see a bigger growth in what we call
machine-to-machine  information  flow  than  simply  humans  on  the
Internet,  per  se.  I  mean,  today,  in  the  world,  I  think  at  any  point
in  time,  200  million  people  are  on  the  Internet  with  a  billion  pos-
sible connections going on.

So moving on from that to say this is a big issue. The thing that
I  would  note,  it  isn’t  simply  cyber  security  but  the  confluence  of
cyber and physical security in the Internet. Solving the cyber issue
doesn’t  solve  the  reliability  or  the  vulnerability  of  the  Internet.
There  are  number  of  points  in  the  world  which  are  well  disclosed
where  big  nodes  come  together.  There  are  critical  points  that  you
can  find.  If  you  choose  to  scan  the  Internet,  you  will  see  these
today  where  it  all  comes  together.  And  of  course,  it  is—that  be-
comes another big issue as to who is in charge. How should we se-
cure or harden these particular environments?

So another area to think about in all of this conversation is mak-
ing  sure  we  touch  on  the  edges  on  the  nature  of  the  physical  dis-
tribution of the Internet. Now you might say, ‘‘What are companies
doing  for  themselves  in  the  space,  because  clearly  they  should  be
self-reliant?’’  And  we  are  pretty  well.  But  in  a  sense,  what  we  do
control, if you like, is the last mile, the mile into our premises. But
the  millions  of  miles  of  Internet,  we  have  no  control  over  and  no
say-so  on  its  deliverability  or  its  resilience.  So  all  of  this  traffic  is
heading to a place where it is almost out of reach of the businesses,
but  because  of  economic  pressures,  efficiency,  and  almost  an  al-
ways-on environment which we demand nowadays, the job is on.

So that broadly says that the problem is real. It is big and prob-
ably  getting  bigger  with  time.  And  the  dimensions  are  not  well
aware  with  policy  makers.  In  my  job,  I  travel  around  most  of  the
world,  and  I  would  say  the  same  level  of  lack  of  knowledge  of  the
dependency of real business, if you like, world trade is now coming
to the Internet.

Look at the United States where we have eight channels of prin-
ciple  critical  national  infrastructure  and  trace  it  all  back,  most  of

it ends up somewhere back on the Internet. So if you look through
energy,  transportation,  aviation,  it  all  comes,  to  some  point,  to
some degree, to the Internet.

And  then  to  look  forward  more  optimistically  say  what  there  is
to  do,  I  would  offer  there  are  two  areas  to  think  about.  One  is  fix-
ing what we have. And we have heard from Mr. Purdy various en-
deavors  to  do  that.  I  would  only  add  to  his  remarks  and  say  what
business  would  look  at  isn’t  simply  the  risk  envelope  but  the  con-
sequences. Within a major corporation, as in BP, the number of at-
tempts  or  events  per  day  that  come  into  the  system  is  between  a
half  million  and  a  million  attempts  on  the  Internet.  Of  those,  only
a handful really matter to the company.

And  the  issue  is  how  do  you  screen  out  the  knives  on  the  Inter-
net and get to the issues that actually ultimately take out business
and  make  it  quite  difficult.  So  working  with  that,  certainly  busi-
nesses want to become more aligned with activities of the agencies
to  bring  forward  the  notion  of  risk  management  and  consequences
into  this  conversation  so  that  the  money  is  spent  wisely  on  the
right priorities. Because you can imagine, you could do a ton of re-
search across a large landscape and not nail the problem.

So  the  question  is  how  do  you  converge  the  issue  in  the  near-
term, in the course of 2006, 2007, and 2008 to put this into a much
better state? So that is one aspect of the way forward.

I  think  the  other  aspect  of  the  way  forward  is  really  a  new  con-
versation, and I will call it mixed generation Internet, not Internet
2,  which  is  basically  in  the  scientific  domain,  but  looking  20  years
out.  Most  of  all,  of  the  United  States  to  start  a  conversation  that
moves  us  to  the  next  generation,  if  you  like,  of  public  utility,  i.e.,
in order so business can progress. Already, in my travels to the Far
East,  countries  like  South  Korea  and  Japan  are  talking  of  moving
to  IPv6,  and  so  we  are  going  to  end  up,  at  some  stage,  with  dif-
ferent initiatives in different geographies but no one really holding
the game plan, the overall strategic intent, or I would call it, tech-
nology  development  map,  even  the  governments.  Who  gets  to  say
in such a complex world?

So  from  my  point  of  view,  let  me  summarize  and  say  the  issue
is  real.  We  should  not  be  distracted  into  the  near-term  issues
alone,  but  also  take  the  position,  I  think,  through  this  committee
to  discuss  what  is  the  nature  of  the  strategic  intent  for  the  future
that ensures world trade carries on in the way it is.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

BUSINESS CONCERNS FOR THE INTERNET

STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE

The Internet is rapidly becoming the backbone of the world economy. This is par-
ticularly  true  for  the  United  States  where  the  use  of  the  Internet  underpins  many
aspects of the U.S. economy and national critical infrastructure (e.g., energy, water,
transportation).  Given  this  fundamental  dependency  on  its  continuous  availability,
the public Internet must be better protected, managed and controlled. In the longer-
term,  the  U.S.  should  take  a  leadership  role  in  creating  the  next  generation  Global
Internet.

SUMMARY OF THE ISSUE

34

The  growth  of  Internet  use  has  been  nothing  short  of  extraordinary.1 Almost  by
stealth  since  the  dot  com  collapse,  governments,  public  bodies  and  large  and  small
scale businesses have been transformed to operate with the Internet as a core piece
of business infrastructure. Businesses from all over the world have found the Inter-
net  to  be  a  cost  effective  and  reliable  business  tool.  Indeed,  in  the  last  few  years,
in  addition  to  conventional  business  transactions,  many  of  the  controls  systems
(SCADA)  that  support  national  and  public  utilities  are  adopting  the  Internet  as  a
core data transport method.2 This has resulted in businesses and societies becoming
critically dependent on the continuous operation of the Internet.3

Businesses  have  moved  from  dial-up  and  dedicated  point  to  point  leased  lines  to
committing  mission  critical  digital  traffic  to  operate  on  the  Internet,  yet  with  no
practical alternative to maintain business continuity. However, the Internet is most-
ly run by groups of diverse academic and non-profit organizations which operate via
loose  consensus.  Many  governments  have  apparently  not  yet  fully  grasped  that  na-
tional and international economies and their citizens are now dependent on this net-
work of networks—i.e., the global communications backbone.

In its current operation the Internet has well known physical and logical security
weaknesses  both  nationally  and  globally.  What  is  not  truly  known  is  the  potential
business impact of these weaknesses on the U.S. and the world economy. Continued
operation is presumed, but is in no way guaranteed. This is compounded by the poor
understanding  of  dependency/interdependencies  between  companies  and  critical  in-
frastructures supporting nations/regions.

Global  competition  has  driven  the  need  for  ever  increasing  levels  of  productivity
and  innovation  from  businesses  and  this  has  driven  the  demand  for  cheaper  and
more ubiquitous communications. The nature of the architecture of the Internet has
allowed it to carry an ever increasing variety of services, with ever decreasing costs.
These  forces  are  driving  applications,  services  and  business  processes  from  every
sector  onto  the  Internet.  Businesses  that  fail  to  exploit  these  cost  and  performance
advantages are at a competitive disadvantage.

Today,  at  moment  there  are  some  200  million  individuals  active  on  the  Internet.
By  the  end  of  2005,  at  least  one  billion  people  will  have  access  to  its  enormous  re-
sources.4 Also  there  are  as  many  automated  systems—including  SCADA  systems,
CCTV,  pipelines,  electricity  grids,  e-mail  servers,  inventory  systems  and  medical
monitoring  devices.  These  systems  often  communicate  over  the  Internet  without
human  intervention.  This  machine-to-machine  communication  is  growing  dramati-
cally and could supplant interactive use by people in a few years.5

In  2004,  $6.9  trillion  of  the  $55.6  trillion  of  worldwide  trade  was  directly  trans-
acted  over  the  Internet.6 Of  the  remaining  trade  there  was  a  significant  proportion
that  relied  on  supporting  activity  using  the  Internet  for  communication—including
specification  queries,  logistics  and  links  between  internal  processes  within  compa-
nies.  Even  financial  institutions  use  the  Internet  for  many  routine  electronic  funds
transfers.7 Significantly,  in  2004  and  in  the  U.S.  alone,  14.8  million  high  tech  jobs
relied directly on the Internet.8

In the past there have been attempts to address the issues of security, operational
stability  and  reliability  but  with  limited  success.  For  example,  work  conducted  by
the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) nearly ten
years  ago,  raised  vulnerabilities  that  are  apparently  yet  to  be  addressed.9 It  set  a
goal  of  a  reliable,  interconnected,  and  secure  information  system  infrastructure  by
the year 2003. Is the context and sense of urgency different today?

This paper explains why the context is now so very different. In the ’80s and early
’90s companies were not using the Internet in anything like the same way or to the
same  scale  as  they  do  today.  Private  networks  were  the  common  means  of  commu-
nication.  The  companies  providing  Internet  infrastructure  were  justified  in  treating
identified weaknesses as rather academic and with little economic importance.

However,  things  have  changed  and  in  ways  that  often  only  businesses  directly
using the Internet can articulate.10 Companies can, and do, take security measures

to protect the systems they run and the services directly under their immediate con-
trol. But they can do little, to protect the external network infrastructure on which
they  rely  or  even  engage  in  a  meaningful  dialogue  about  fundamental  performance
expectations.  Previous  work  in  evaluating  risks  to  the  Internet  has  almost  entirely
focused  around  a  dialogue  between  supply-side  telecommunications/IT  companies
and  government.11 We  therefore  only  have  half  the  picture,  knowledge  of  inter-
dependency  between  supply  and  demand-side  for  Internet  services  clearly  needs  to
be shared.

Even  more  troubling  is  that  many  demand-side  organizations  do  not  realise  how
dependent  they  are  on  the  Internet.  Corporations  have  become  linked  to  the  Inter-
net in ways that are not always easily discerned. For example, a major corporation
that  depends  on  a  third  party’s  logistical  services  may  be  surprised  to  learn  that
their  supplier  communicates  internal  orders  and  status  using  the  Internet,  or  that
an  electric  utility  they  depend  upon  has  moved  its  process  control  network  to  run
over the Internet.

These  cascading  dependencies  all  too  quickly  create  ‘domino  effects’  that  are  not
obvious to the corporate customer or to the policy-maker. They are usually only dis-
covered  during  unplanned  outages  when  capabilities  begin  to  degrade  or  fail  in  un-
expected  ways,  or  are  discovered  during  widely-based  crisis  management  exercises.
Businesses  and  governments  can  plan  for  expected  failures.  But  even  the  best  pre-
pared  organizations  and  corporations  may  be  woefully  inadequate  in  responding  to
complex,  low  probability,  high  impact  failures.  If  a  large  scale  Internet  outage  or
significant  reduction  in  performance  were  to  occur,  the  unexpected  effects  on  whole
sets  of  industries,  utilities  and  enterprise  could  have  surprisingly  large  economic
and societal impacts.

Whether  the  failure  of  the  Internet  arises  through  error,  a  worm-writers  experi-
ment,  or  more  directed  physical  or  cyber  attacks,  vulnerabilities  exist  and  this  is
a  real  and  present  risk.  Recent  reports  about  ‘‘Cyber  attack’’  attempts  being  devel-
oped  and  the  posting  of  hacker  tools  with  directions  on  some  of  the  extremist’s
websites may be warning signs.
BROADER CONTEXT

It  is  worth  recalling  that  the  Internet  was  set  up  as  a  government  sponsored
project, with the U.S. Government as the primary customer and ‘anchor tenant.’ Its
creation was a bold and dramatic step-out that went on to evolve into a remarkable
resource  that  has  significantly  exceeded  the  wildest  imaginings  of  its  creators.  As
a result it is being used far beyond anything envisaged in the original designs.

Since  its  creation,  the  Internet  has  developed  rapidly  in  scale,  but  its  technical
design has progressed more through steady incremental evolution than through any
step  change.  The  ‘‘grass  roots’’  and  academically-based  standards  setting  process  of
the  Internet  Engineering  Taskforce  (IETF)  has  had  great  success.  However,  the
down-side of this consensus approach is that entity wide coordination and alignment
is  difficult  to  achieve  and  step  changes  are  difficult  to  implement.  Internet  stand-
ards setters are a community of interest and as such they share interests, but they
do  not  share  goals  and  timescales  in  the  way  that  a  project  with  a  clear  mandate
does.12

This  diversity  of  interest  has  been  compounded  by  the  loss  of  the  primary  cus-
tomer,  i.e.,  the  U.S.  Government,  driving  operational  performance  requirements,
since  they  have  started  to  use  alternative  infrastructures  for  extra  critical  services.
Instead of a single ‘anchor tenant,’ the Internet now has countless customers drawn
from  many  governments,  corporations  and  individual  users  and  is  thus  driven  by
a  very  diverse  range  of  agendas,  without  a  clear  priority  setting  process.  This  will
further  slow  change  and  adaptation  to  the  new  and  emerging  context  of  Internet
use.

The  question  we  need  to  ask  is  whether  incremental  change  will  be  sufficient  to
address  the  current  physical  and  digital  integrity  weaknesses.  The  current  defi-
ciencies on the Internet may well be filled by tactical repairs, but the potential gap
of predictable demand for high volume traffic with high quality services and the in-
tractable vulnerabilities will require a more radical approach. Arguably the risks we
are  seeing,  illustrated  by  spreading  worms  and  viruses  and  underlying  common
mode  weaknesses  in  technologies  and  physical  infrastructure  are  systemic  and  sys-

ture Assurance Council (NIAC).

tematic  in  nature.13 Systemic  and  systematic  risks  can  only  be  addressed  through
coordinated rather than isolated action. A fact well illustrated by other complex sys-
tems  such  as  vaccination  statistics  and  epidemiology  in  the  medical  world  and  in
the  risk  management  intervention  required  in  national  and  global  banking  sys-
tems.14 Many of these risks have no geographic or country boundaries—impact and
influence is global.

The  widespread  globalization  of  the  Internet  also  introduces  a  further  develop-
ment  complexity.  Scores  of  countries  now  have  fundamental  interests  in  its  evo-
lution and some are even orchestrating local step-changes in technology.15 However,
no country has yet felt able to propose fundamental change on a global basis. Within
the  U.S.,  the  Internet  is  seen  in  many  quarters  as  the  starting  point  for  the  Na-
tional Information Infrastructure (NII). Around the world, there is growing recogni-
tion that the set of NIIs (assuming each country commits to developing one) should
be  compatible  with  each  other  in  an—as  yet—undefined  way.  Who  should  take  the
lead  in  ensuring  this  compatibility?  There  is  clearly  an  important  role  for  govern-
ment  leadership  in  framing  this  strategic  agenda—with  strong  collaboration  with
commerce and business.

In  practice,  the  technical  scope  of  the  Internet  already  goes  beyond  that  defined
as  ‘‘Internet  services.’’  Ultimately,  the  communication  pathways  must  enter  the
user’s  machine/other  digital  devices,  pass  through  layers  of  software  and  end  up  in
applications programs. The computer industry, along with the many vendors of com-
puter-related  equipment,  must  play  a  role  in  determining  how  this  aspect  of  the
Internet will evolve and therefore form part of the supply-side. A key to the success
of the Internet is to ensure that the interested parties have an equitable way of par-
ticipating  in  its  evolution,  including  participation  in  its  evolving  standards  process
and  technology  roadmap.  A  proper  role  for  governments  would  be  to  oversee  this
process to make sure that it meets the wide spectrum of public and industry needs.
Yet  further  complexity  and  dependency  is  being  introduced  by  a  new  breed  of
service providers who are offering services that will continue to supplant alternative
networks. Telephony (through Voice Over IP), television, radio and almost all forms
of  communication  are  migrating  to  the  Internet  or  including  the  Internet  as  a  key
component in the communication path.
CONCLUSIONS ON CURRENT POSITION

the Internet.

fore not only the U.S. economy, but economies worldwide, are at risk.

• There  are  no  clear  accountabilities  or  guarantees  for  the  continuity  of  oper-
ation  of  the  Internet.  Even  weaknesses  known  about  for  some  time  have  not
yet been addressed.
• A  significant  and  growing  proportion  of  the  world  economy  is  dependent  on
• The Internet is currently subject to technical and geopolitical risk and there-
• The  U.S.  Government  itself  is  no  longer  fully  dependent  on  the  Internet,  as
it has alternative networks at its disposal for critical services. Thus the Inter-
net  has  moved  from  having  a  single  ‘anchor  tenant’  to  a  diverse  community
of  stakeholders  without  a  voice  in  the  operational  performance  expectations
of the current Internet.
• New  technologies  and  emergent  Internet  uses,  such  as  Voice  Over  IP  and
widespread  control  system  connectivity,  are  increasing  dependency  and
compounding the risk.

OPTIONS ON THE WAY FORWARD

We  would  consider  a  two-pronged  approach,  to  address  both  the  immediate  risk

and the strategic opportunity:
1. Short-Term

To  address  immediate  concerns  a  series  of  in-depth  and  as  necessary  classified
studies,  workshops  and  truly  cross-sectoral  exercises  should  be  held  to  allow  busi-
nesses  (that  deliver  critical  aspects  of  national  infrastructure—e.g.,  energy,  trans-
portation  and  financial)  and  governments  to  share  critical  information  under  the
Protected  Critical  Infrastructure  Information  (PCII)  Program.  The  goal  of  this  work

37

would  be  to  map  the  business  reliance  upon  the  Internet  against  known  areas  of
risk  and  develop  a  priority  plan  to  focus  actions  that  are  necessary  for  increasing
its robustness and integrity.

The work could start with the scope of the U.S. economy in a global context. Inter-
dependency  should  then  dictate  that  it  be  extended  in  the  first  instance  to  other
countries from the G8 and EU.
2. Medium-Term

There  is  a  need  to  create  the  next  generation  Internet  in  a  form  that  would  be
able  to  handle  the  emerging  demands  of  business,  civil  societies  and  governments.
This  would  include  the  technical  design  necessary  to  meet  physical  and  logical  di-
versity  and  resilience.  In  addition,  the  program  should  include  the  development  of
a Global Internet Management Framework that addresses broad policies and stand-
ards,  clarity  of  operational  accountabilities,  and  technology  roadmaps.  The  goal
should  be  to  assure  the  performance  and  digital  integrity  of  the  new  Global  Inter-
net,  in  terms  of  resilience  to  physical  and  cyber-security  risks,  supplier  commercial
failure, and broader geopolitical risks.

We  believe  the  U.S.  should  take  a  leading  role  in  this  proposed  global  initiative.
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  express  the  views  of  the  business  community.
I  look  forward  to  continuing  our  conversation  as  our  CEO  roundtable  at  BENS
(Business  Executives  for  National  Security)  progresses.  We  look  forward  to  contrib-
uting to the actions that we propose.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Leggate.
Mr. Kepler.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  DAVID  E.  KEPLER,  CORPORATE  VICE
PRESIDENT  OF  SHARED  SERVICES  AND  CHIEF  INFORMA-
TION OFFICER, THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY
Mr.  KEPLER.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Gordon,  for  allowing  me  to  share  my  thoughts  on  this  impor-
tant topic.

Mr.  Chairman,  before  I  begin,  our  thoughts  and  prayers  go  out
to  the  millions  of  Americans,  including  many  of  our  7,000  employ-
ees,  on  the  Gulf  Coast  who  have  lost  so  much  from  Hurricane
Katrina.

The importance of information infrastructure for communications
and  emergency  response  in  a  national  crisis  has  never  been  more
apparent.

I  am  Dave  Kepler,  Corporate  Vice  President  of  Shared  Services
and  Chief  Information  Officer  of  the  Dow  Chemical  Company,  the
world’s largest chemical and plastics producer.

I am also here as Chairman of the Executive Board of our Indus-
try  Cyber  Security  Program.  Our  mission  is  to  understand,  prior-
itize, and coordinate our efforts to address cyber security risks.

Today,  I  would  like  to  discuss  the  role  of  information  technology
in our sector, describe the cyber security threats we face, and high-
light  what  is  being  done  to  address  these  threats.  I  will  also  sug-
gest areas where I think government can help.

With $109 billion in exports, the chemical industry is the largest
exporter  in  the  U.S.  economy.  We  employ  one  million  Americans
and  are  one  of  the  largest  private  industry  investors  in  research
and development. Our products help keep the water we drink safe,
increase  productivity  of  agriculture,  enable  medical  innovations,
and are essential to homeland defense and the war on terror.

It  is  in  our  nation’s  interest  to  have  a  competitive  chemical  in-
dustry. Information technology is key in maintaining that competi-
tiveness. At Dow, information technology is fully integrated into all
aspects of our business, and advanced technology is used to secure
our  facilities.  We  rely  on  the  automation  and  integration  of  our
processes to drive productivity, quality, and safety.

The Internet is a valuable communications tool essential to pub-
lic  safety  and  emergency  response.  For  example,  when  all  of  the
phone  service  was  disrupted  from  the  hurricane,  Dow  was  able  to
use  the  Internet  and  Internet-based  phones  to  communicate  with
our people in the region.

In 2004, chemical industry executives conducted an industry vul-
nerability  assessment.  We  concluded  that,  unlike  an  attack  on
other  critical  infrastructures,  a  security  breach  from  cyber  would
not cause cascading impact across the chemical industry. However,
we  believe  the  highest  concern  for  our  industry  is  the  potential  of
a combined physical and cyber attack.

There are three specific areas for concern in the chemical indus-

One, using information on shipments, product inventory, or sites
to  construct  a  physical  attack.  That  is  why  Dow  has  set  in  place

practices, policies, and technologies to protect critical plant systems
and corporate networks.

Two,  using  false  identity  to  acquire  chemicals  for  improper  use.
Our  company  counters  this  threat  by  pre-identifying  and  verifying
customers.

Three,  gaining  inappropriate  access  to  systems  to  cause  isolated
disruptions.  At  Dow,  operating  practices  and  authentication  tech-
nologies  are  continuously  being  upgraded  to  restrict  access  based
on roles and clearances.

Our company has conducted a comprehensive cyber security risk
analysis, and we have used the Sandia National Lab’s methodology
for assessing vulnerabilities for our sites and manufacturing facili-
ties. Dow has developed a cyber security management plan, and we
continue to test and upgrade our plans in all areas of security.

But  we  cannot  address  cyber  security  threats  alone.  Security  of
the  communications  and  Internet  infrastructure  is  beyond  any  one
sector’s  control.  Protecting  these  vital  assets  from  a  significant  at-
tack, whether physical, cyber, or a combination, is of utmost impor-
tance.

So what role does government play?
The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  must  contend  with  the
real threat of attacks by people, organizations, or nations intent on
causing significant disruptions to our economy and way of life. Pro-
tecting communications in the event of a national emergency must
be  a  priority  along  with  threat  monitoring  and  modeling,  authen-
tication  methods  and  information  protection.  We  must  understand
how  to  prevent  attacks,  what  is  needed  to  defend  against  attacks,
and  how  to  recover  infrastructure  from  a  catastrophic  failure.  De-
partment of Homeland Security resources and R&D efforts must be
dedicated to the big picture.

In  closing,  we  are  encouraged  by  the  Department’s  work  to  pro-
vide—the work with the private sector to reduce vulnerabilities and
minimize  the  severity  of  cyber  attacks.  But  more  needs  to  be  done
to  share  and  protect  relevant  information  across  all  sectors  and
government.  Government  crisis  management  and  disaster  recovery
plans  must  include  industry  participation,  coordinated  emergency
response,  and  ongoing  monitoring,  and  managed  recovery  efforts
with government and industry together are critical.

Thank  you,  and  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  at  the

end.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID E. KEPLER

Thank  you  Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon  for  allowing  me  to

share my thoughts on this important topic.

Mr.  Chairman,  before  I  begin,  our  thoughts  and  prayers  go  out  to  the  millions  of
Americans,  including  many  of  our  7,000  employees  on  the  gulf  coast  who  have  lost
so much from Hurricane Katrina.

Our  number  one  priority  is  the  safety  and  well-being  of  our  employees  and  the
communities  impacted  by  this  disaster.  We  are  committed  to  safely  returning  our
facilities  to  full  operation  and  contributing  to  the  recovery  efforts.  The  importance
of  information  infrastructure  for  communications  and  emergency  response  in  a  na-
tional crisis has never been more apparent.

I’m Dave Kepler, Corporate Vice President of Shared Services and Chief Informa-
tion Officer of The Dow Chemical Company. Dow is the world’s largest chemical and
plastics producer with annual sales of over $40 billion serving customers in markets

such  as:  food,  transportation,  health  and  medicine,  personal  and  home  care,  and
building and construction.

I  am  also  here  as  the  Chairman  of  the  Executive  Board  of  the  Chemical  Sector
Cyber  Security  Program.  This  effort  was  established  in  2002  to  coordinate  the  sec-
tor’s  activity  and  to  align  with  the  U.S.  Government’s  National  Strategy  to  Secure
Cyberspace.  The  program’s  mission  is  to  understand  the  risks  we  face  as  a  sector
and  coordinate  and  prioritize  our  efforts  to  reduce  those  risks.  Leadership  for  this
program  is  provided  by  the  chemical  industry’s  leading  CIOs,  and  leverages  exper-
tise from existing organizations: chemical trade associations, the Chemical Industry
Data Exchange, and the Chemical Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

The five strategic elements of the program are:

tor cyber security

accelerate development of improved, cost-effective solutions.

The  program  produced  comprehensive  cyber  security  guidance  which  was  built
into the Responsible Care Security Code in 2004. Implementation of the Responsible
Care Security Code is mandatory for all members of the American Chemistry Coun-
cil and has also been adopted by the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers As-
sociation.

Our  sector  continues  to  work  closely  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,
standards bodies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
and industry organizations such as Instrumentation Systems and Automation (ISA)
to  share  the  latest  best  practices  and  to  develop  new  standards  to  defend  against
cyber attacks.

Today, I would like to discuss the role of information technology in our sector, de-
scribe the cyber security threats we face and highlight what is being done to address
these threats. I will also suggest areas where the government can help.

Let  me  begin  by  outlining  the  importance  of  our  sector  to  our  nation’s  economic
well-being and security—enabling 25 percent of our nation’s GDP. With $109 billion
dollars in exports, the chemical industry is the largest exporter in the U.S. economy.
We employ one million Americans and are one of the largest private industry inves-
tors  in  research  and  development.  Our  industry  makes  modern  life  possible,  from
plastics to pharmaceuticals, from cars to clothing. Our products help keep the water
we  drink  safe,  increase  productivity  of  agriculture,  and  enable  medical  innovations
that  prevent  and  treat  disease.  Our  industry  is  also  essential  to  homeland  defense
and  the  war  on  terror—making  products  that  go  into  bullet-resistant  vests,  night
vision goggles and stealth aircraft.

Our industry’s safety culture and history of cooperative voluntary initiatives, part-
nerships with local, State and Federal Government agencies, and strong support for
research  and  development,  position  us  well  to  address  new  security  challenges.  For
example, the industry joined forces to develop the American Chemistry Council’s Re-
sponsible  Care  Security  Code—building  upon  long-standing  industry  safety  and
emergency response programs.

All  aspects  of  security  are  integrated  into  the  Security  Code  including  physical
plant security, transportation security, as well as cyber security. Implementation of
the Responsible Care Security Code is mandatory for all American Chemistry Coun-
cil  members  leading  to  over  $2  billion  in  investments  to  improve  security  and  pre-
paredness across our industry.
Cyber security has been on our radar screen long before the tragic events of 9/11.
At  Dow,  for  example,  we  have  had  policies  and  practices  in  place  for  securing  our
information  assets  for  many  years.  These  cover  the  use  of  the  Internet,  integration
of systems, and automation of manufacturing control. The emergence of a significant
terrorist  threat  with  the  events  of  9/11  added  urgency  and  focus  to  our  efforts.  It
was this event that prompted the establishment of the Chemical Sector Cyber Secu-
rity program.

It’s in our national interest to have a competitive chemical industry, and informa-
tion  technology  is  key  in  maintaining  that  competitiveness.  At  Dow,  information
technology is fully integrated into all aspects of our business—research and develop-
ment,  manufacturing,  accounting,  logistics  and  sales  to  name  just  a  few.  We  also
use  information  technology  to  interact  with  government  agencies  and  to  report  our

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:26 Mar 14, 2006 Jkt 023332 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\091505\23332 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

regulatory compliance. Advanced technology is also being leveraged to secure our fa-
cilities and the distribution of our products. We rely on automation and integration
of our processes to drive productivity, quality, and safety.

At  Dow,  approximately  15  percent  of  our  orders  are  via  the  Internet,  and  nearly
all of our customers use the Internet to learn about our products, track orders, and
get  technical  support.  The  Internet  is  also  a  valuable  communications  tool—essen-
tial  to  public  safety  and  emergency  response.  For  example,  in  the  aftermath  of
Katrina when all phone service was disrupted, Dow was able to use Internet based
phones to communicate with our facilities in the region.

In  2004,  chemical  company  executives  conducted  an  industry-level  vulnerability
assessment  to  determine  the  potential  impact  of  cyber  security  threats.  We  con-
cluded  that,  unlike  an  attack  on  other  critical  infrastructures,  a  cyber  security
breach would not cause cascading impact across the chemical industry.

We  believe  the  higher  concern  for  our  industry  is  the  potential  of  a  combined

physical and cyber attack or the criminal use of illegally obtained information.

There are three specific areas of concern for the chemical industry:

1. Using  information  on  shipments,  product  inventory,  or  sites  to  construct  a
physical attack. That’s why Dow has set in place policies, practices and tech-
nologies  to  protect  the  linkage  of  critical  plant  systems  with  corporate  net-
works.

2. Using  false  identity  to  acquire  chemicals  for  improper  use.  Our  company
counters  this  threat  by  pre-identifying  and  verifying  our  customers  before
electronic orders.

3. Gaining  inappropriate  access  to  systems  to  cause  isolated  disruptions.  At
Dow, operating practices and authentication technology is continuously being
upgraded to restrict what people can do based on roles and clearances.

For obvious reasons, I cannot get into all we do to protect ourselves, but here are

some additional steps that Dow has taken to combat these threats.

Addressing people, process and technology, we have:

cident management and business continuity.

• Developed a company-wide cyber security management plan that includes in-
• Completed a comprehensive cyber security risk analysis based on the ISO in-
• Used  the  U.S.  Government  Sandia  National  Labs  methodology  for  assessing
vulnerability  of  our  sites  and  manufacturing  facilities—including  a  review  of
physical, process, and cyber vulnerabilities.

formation security standard, ISO/IEC 17799.

We continue to test and upgrade our plans in all areas of security.
Although  much  has  been  done  within  the  chemical  sector,  we  cannot  address
cyber security threats alone. Security of the Nation’s telecommunications and Inter-
net infrastructure is beyond any one sector’s control. Protecting the Nation’s critical
communication  and  information  infrastructure  from  a  significant  attack,  whether
physical, cyber, or combined, is of the utmost importance.

So, what role should the government play? While there are many issues impacting
secure  computing  today  such  as  random  hacking  and  the  e-mail  virus  of  the  day,
the Department of Homeland Security must contend with the real threat of attacks
by  people,  organizations  or  nations—intent  on  causing  significant  disruption  to  our
economy  and  way  of  life.  Targeted  attacks  that  could  have  a  major  economic  or  so-
cial impact must be the priority as well as protecting our communications capability
in the event of a national emergency.

Department of Homeland Security resources and research and development efforts
should  be  dedicated  to  addressing  these  ‘big  picture’  threats  to  benefit  all  sectors
and improve our national security. Threat monitoring and modeling, better methods
for authenticating identity, and information protection should be research priorities.
Efforts  should  include  understanding  how  to  prevent  attacks,  what  resources  and
tools  are  needed  to  defend  against  attacks,  and  what  it  would  take  to  reconstitute
our information technology infrastructure in the event of a catastrophic failure.

We are encouraged by the Department’s work with the public and private sectors
to  reduce  vulnerabilities  and  minimize  the  severity  of  cyber  attacks.  But,  more
needs  to  be  done  around  the  sharing  and  protection  of  relevant  information  across
all critical sectors and government. Finally, government crisis management and dis-
aster recovery plans must include industry participation. As witnessed in the after-
math  of  Katrina—coordinated  emergency  response,  ongoing  monitoring,  and  man-
aged recovery efforts with government and industry are critical.

We  believe  continued  and  expanded  cooperation  between  our  critical  sector,  the
Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  other  government  agencies  as  well  as  infor-

mation technology providers is vital to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance prepared-
ness.

Any efforts to improve cyber security must:

• Start  and  end  with  the  commitment  to  be  a  risk-based,  outcome-focused  pro-
gram. DHS must focus on the real threat of criminal attacks by people, orga-
nizations or nations.

• Recognize that cyber security is an integral part of overall security, and build
upon  the  work  to  date  of  the  chemical  sector  security  programs  such  as  the
Responsible Care Security Code and the Chemical Sector Cyber Security Pro-
gram.

• Recognize  the  high  degree  of  integration  of  the  chemical  sector  with  other
critical infrastructure sectors, as well as the importance of our industry to our
homeland defense and economic security.

In closing, we are committed to ensuring the security of our company and to tak-
ing  a  leadership  role  in  improving  overall  security  across  our  industry.  Information
sharing and continued cooperation between our sector and the Department of Home-
land  Security  is  critical.  Above  all  else,  efforts  must  be  focused  on  those  threats  of
greatest  impact  and  concern  to  our  national  security,  while  addressing  the  unique
needs of each sector.

Thank you and I’d be happy to answer any questions.

POWER
Mr.  FREESE.  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of  this
committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you
today.

My name is Gerry Freese, Director of Enterprise Information Se-
curity at American Electric Power. I am also here representing the
North  American  Electrical  Reliability  Council  in  Princeton,  New
Jersey.

AEP is the largest provider of electricity in the country with over

mation  security  for  all  corporate  and  operational  systems  and  net-
works, including those used in the operation of the bulk power sys-
tem.

Before  I  address  the  three  questions  posed  to  the  presenters,  I

would like to preface my remarks.

In  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  have  seen  the  suf-
fering  and  the  unprecedented  devastation  in  Louisiana  and  Mis-
sissippi.  We  have  seen  the  confusion  and  chaos  when  essential
services  were  no  longer  functioning.  We  have  seen  how  critical  in-
frastructure  can  be  destabilized  and  destroyed  when  links  are  bro-
ken  in  its  complex  chain  of  multiple  interdependencies.  Whether
the  cause  is  a  natural  disaster  or  a  terrorist  attack,  the  impact  on
people and the economy is horrendous.

Critical  infrastructure  industries,  by  virtue  of  their  interdepend-
encies, have a responsibility to work across all sectors, and this in-
cludes  the  Federal  Government,  to  mitigate  risk,  ensure  service
continuity and an expeditious recovery in the event of a natural or
manmade disaster.

This  hearing  is  timely  in  its  intent  to  explore  means  to  expand
the  cooperation  and  collaboration  between  the  private  and  public
critical infrastructure sectors.

Now for responses to the three questions.
For  the  first  question,  the  electricity  sector  has,  in  many  cases,
developed its own telecommunications network for conducting elec-
tricity operations, but it is steadily becoming more reliant on public
networks.  The  electric  sector  uses  these  public  networks  for  many
functions  with  the  net  result  that  its  interfaces  with  the  tele-
communications  sector  have  become  more  numerous  and  complex.
Both sectors are working together to better understand their levels
of  operational  integration  and  in  ways  the  vulnerability  in  either
of these sectors impacts the other.

Because  of  these  complex  and  critical  interdependencies,  it  is
fairly  clear  that  serious  damage  or  disruption  of  telecommuni-
cations  could  seriously  undermine  the  operation  and  reliability  of
the  electricity  infrastructure.  Accordingly,  the  electric  sector  has
taken  some  decisive  steps  to  secure  the  cyber  and  physical  re-
sources  and  will  continue  to  invest  in  comprehensive  and  effective
security  measures.  We  have  interim  cyber  security  standards  in
place right now and are working diligently to move through the ap-
proval  process  for  a  permanent,  more  expansive  critical  infrastruc-
ture protection standard.

The  final  product  will  strengthen  cyber  security  across  the  elec-
tric  sector  and  lay  the  groundwork  for  greater  collaboration  be-
tween industry and government.

In  response  to  the  second  question,  the  electric  industry  views
government  entities,  such  as  DHS  and  DOE,  as  partners  in  sector
cyber security. In fact, we have worked extensively with DHS, DOE
representatives,  the  National  Labs,  and  others  to  try  and  identify
areas  of  focus  for  good  security  and  determine  means  to  carry  out
what we all see as primary responsibilities for national security.

We  believe  the  office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  Cyber  Secu-
rity and Telecommunications should focus on several specific areas
covering  private  and  public  sector  cooperation.  These  areas  center
on  greater  awareness  of  critical  infrastructure  interdependencies,

information  sharing  between  government  and  the  private  sector,
and true, non-prescriptive partnerships. I would be happy to elabo-
rate  on  those  three  points  in  the  question-and-answer  period,  if  it
is possible.

As to the third question regarding possible research and develop-
ment opportunities, the electric sector is interested in continuing to
work  closely  with  DOE  on  the  work  being  done  at  the  Idaho  Na-
tional Lab. We believe it holds great promise as one of the best and
most  efficient  means  of  stimulating  research  and  developing  tech-
nical  solutions  to  the  present  cyber  security  problems.  DOE  and
DHS  have  provided  leadership  and  support  on  this  initiative,  and
the electricity industry is committed to its success.

Regarding  inadequacies  of  the  electric  sector  security  solution,
the  present  electric  infrastructure  has  been  built  over  many  years
and various types of process control systems produced by a diverse
set of vendors. These legacy systems are a large part of the reason
that  new  technology  security  solutions  cannot  be  more  widely  de-
ployed across the industry.

The long-term solution to this is to begin a process of rebuilding
the  old  infrastructure  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  replacing  it  with
next-generation equipment and technology. The new infrastructure
would be based on greater levels of security and reliability with en-
hanced  design  recognition  of  the  interdependencies  between  the
electric and telecommunications sectors.

Work is already underway in this area. The Telecommunications
and  Electric  Power  Interdependencies  Task  Force  is  exploring  the
next  generation  of  public  networks  and  how  the  electricity  sector
will  be  able  to  use  these  networks  of  the  future  through  the  em-
ployment of more sophisticated encryption technology and other se-
curity measures.

Cyber  security  is  evolving  rapidly,  and  all  of  us  working  in  the
discipline  are  tirelessly  seeking  more  effective  solutions  for  pro-
tecting our critical assets and systems. We appreciate your interest
in  this  topic  and  welcome  your  assistance  in  helping  us  to  ensure
our critical infrastructures are protected, secure, and reliable.

Thank you for your attention.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GERALD S. FREESE

Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of  this  committee,  thank  you  for  the
opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Gerry Freese. I am the Director
of Enterprise Information Security for the American Electric Power Company in Co-
lumbus,  Ohio.  AEP  is  the  largest  supplier  of  electricity  in  the  country,  with  over
five million customers in 11 states. I am responsible for information security for all
of  AEP’s  corporate  and  operational  systems  and  networks,  including  those  used  for
the operation of the bulk electric system.

My  reason  for  being  here  today  is  to  talk  about  the  cyber  security  needs  and  ac-
tivities  of  the  entire  electricity  sector,  one  of  North  America’s  most  critical  infra-
structures. During my career, I have worked with numerous industry-wide commit-
tees  addressing  the  growing  need  for  increased  security  for  information  and  cyber
systems.  This  need  is  underscored  by  the  sheer  expanse  and  diversity  of  the  elec-
tricity  sector,  which  is  made  up  of  large  and  small  entities,  publicly,  privately,  and
government owned and operated. Through industry groups and as individual compa-
nies,  we  have  always  placed  great  emphasis  and  the  highest  priority  on  the  need
to protect our information systems and effectively secure the data residing on them.
Before  I  address  the  three  questions  posed  to  the  presenters  by  the  Committee,

I want to make two points.

First,  our  industry  has  long-term  and  positive  working  relationships  with  federal
agencies,  including  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  (DOE).  We  value  these  relationships  and  want  to  work  collabo-
ratively  to  improve  them  even  further.  The  recent  recognition  from  DOE  and  DHS
of  the  Electricity  Sector  Coordinating  Council  (ESCC)  is  a  positive  step.  We  firmly
believe  the  relationships  between  federal  agencies  and  the  industry  are  working
well because both the electricity sector and the federal agencies recognize the value
in  jointly  addressing  issues.  Both  the  industry  and  government  recognize  the  dif-
ficulties posed by prescriptive mandates and overly rigid rules and regulations that
stifle creative solutions to problems.

Second, our industry continues to have concerns about the security of information
after it is provided to the government. The electric infrastructure is one of the most
critical  infrastructures  servicing  the  Nation  and  allowing  us  to  maintain  our  way
of  life.  Certain  technical,  architectural  and  operational  aspects  and  details  must  be
kept  secure  so  they  will  not  be  inadvertently  disclosed  to  those  who  would  try  to
disrupt or destroy our social, political or economic fabric. We believe the Critical In-
frastructure Information (CII) approach meets most of the needs for critical informa-
tion  protection  but  have  been  frustrated  by  an  evident  lack  of  progress  in  fully  im-
plementing this important safeguard.

I will now respond to the three questions posed by the committee. In response to
the  first  question,  the  electricity  sector  has,  in  many  cases,  built  its  own  tele-
communications networks but is steadily becoming more reliant on public networks
as well. The electricity sector uses the public networks for many functions including
customer  service  and  information  exchange  via  the  Internet.  It  also  uses  the  Inter-
net and the public networks for a limited amount of telemonitoring of the electrical
system,  although  this  varies  by  individual  electric  company.  The  interdependencies
between  the  telecommunications  sector  and  the  electricity  sector  are  numerous  and
complex.  Because  of  these  complex  and  critical  interdependencies,  serious  damage
or  disruption  of  the  telecommunications  infrastructure  would  seriously  undermine
the operation and operability of the electricity infrastructure. Both sectors are work-
ing  together  to  better  understand  their  criticality  and  the  ways  that  vulnerabilities
in either of these sectors impacts the other.

Securing  the  extensive,  distributed  and  critical  electric  power  infrastructure  is  a
huge  responsibility  that  the  electricity  industry  takes  very  seriously.  We  have  al-
ready  taken  decisive  steps  to  secure  our  cyber  and  physical  resources  and  will  con-
tinue  to  invest  in  comprehensive  and  effective  security  measures.  We  have  interim
cyber  security  standards  in  place  and  are  working  diligently  to  move  through  the
approval  process  a  permanent,  more  expansive  Critical  Infrastructure  Protection
(CIP)  standard.  The  permanent  standard  will  strengthen  cyber  security  across  the
electricity  sector  and  lay  the  groundwork  for  greater  collaboration  between  the  in-
dustry and government.

In  response  to  the  second  question,  DHS  can  assist  the  electricity  sector  in  cyber
security by continuing its support of security activities like Carnegie Mellon’s Com-
puter Emergency Readiness team. DHS also has been very supportive of other infor-
mation  sharing  activities,  which  adds  value  to  our  industry’s  security  initiatives.
Another  more  recent  example  is  the  Process  Control  Security  Forum.  This  group  is
made  up  of  several  key  industry  sectors  that  use  process  control  systems  and  in-
cludes  government  representatives,  academics,  and  vendors.  The  forum  is  working
to  develop  design  guidelines  for  the  next  generation  of  more  secure  control  systems
and  is  looking  at  what  can  be  done  to  improve  existing  systems.  As  the  forum  con-
tinues  to  make  progress,  the  possibility  of  seed  money  from  DHS  should  be  consid-
ered to stimulate the implementation of the ideas and concepts developed.

Another  way  that  DHS  can  assist  the  electricity  sector  is  by  helping  coordinate
research initiatives taking place in cyber security. Many of the most prestigious in-
stitutions  in  America  are  engaged  in  research  and  development  in  this  area.  The
missing  element  that  hinders  real  progress  is  an  overall  coordination  plan  to  avoid
competition for funding and duplication of effort. The coordination should extend be-
yond  the  borders  of  the  United  States  because  a  number  of  other  countries  such  as
Australia,  Canada,  Great  Britain,  and  Japan  have  also  made  cyber  security  a  top
priority.

The  third  question  focused  on  current  inadequacies  in  security  and  possible  re-
search  and  development  opportunities.  The  electricity  industry  is  interested  in  con-
tinuing  to  work  closely  with  DOE  on  the  work  being  done  at  the  Idaho  National
Laboratory.  We  believe  it  holds  great  promise  as  one  of  the  best  and  most  efficient
means  of  stimulating  research  and  developing  technical  solutions  to  the  present
shortfalls  in  cyber  security.  DOE  and  DHS  have  provided  leadership  and  support
on  this  initiative  and  the  electricity  industry  is  committed  to  its  success.  Again,

DHS should coordinate this work with other projects in this topic, both domestically
and internationally.

The  present  electric  infrastructure  has  been  built  over  many  years  with  various
types  of  process  control  systems  produced  by  a  large  number  of  vendors.  The  long-
term solution to present inadequacies is to build out the old infrastructure with the
next generation of technologies and equipment. The new infrastructure will be based
on greater levels of security and reliability, enhanced design, and recognition of the
interdependencies  between  the  electricity  sector  and  the  communications  sector.
Very interesting work is already taking place in this area. The Telecommunications
and  Electric  Power  Interdependencies  Task  Force  is  exploring  the  next  generation
of public networks and how the electricity sector will be able to use these networks
of  the  future  through  the  employment  of  more  sophisticated  encryption  and  other
security measures.

The cyber security arena is evolving rapidly and all of us working in the field find
it to be an exciting and stimulating professional challenge. Operational and security
technologies are changing quickly. We appreciate your interest in the topic and wel-
come  your  assistance  in  helping  us  to  ensure  that  our  critical  infrastructures  are
protected and secure well in the future. Thank you for your attention.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr.  Geisse.  After  that  wonderful  introduction  by  Mr.  Akin,  I

want to make sure we hear you.

STATEMENT OF MR. ANDREW M. GEISSE, CHIEF INFORMATION

OFFICER, SBC SERVICES, INC.

Mr. GEISSE. It doesn’t go against my five minutes, does it?
Okay. Thank you, Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,
other  Members  of  the  Committee.  And  I  would  like  to  thank  Con-
gressmen  Akin  and  Sessions  for  that  unexpected  and  kind  intro-
duction.

I am pleased to represent SBC Communications on this panel fo-

cused on cyber security within critical industries.

SBC has a long history of providing reliable communication serv-
ices.  We  provide  voice  and  data  communication  services  as  a  local
exchange  carrier  in  13  states.  We  also  provide  services  nationally
as  a  long  distance  provider,  data  services  provider,  and  Internet
services.  We  have  a  national  wireless  presence  with  BellSouth  in

Cingular Wireless, and we recognize the importance of our nation’s
critical communications infrastructure and the role that it plays for
the security of the United States and its citizens. Integrity and reli-
ability  of  our  networks  have  been  cornerstones  of  the  communica-
tions industry.

At  SBC,  we  implement  both  physical  and  cyber  security  meas-
ures  that  protect  both  our  customer-serving  networks  as  well  as
our internal information systems networks. Physical security meas-
ures include things like guard services, card key IDs, visible badge
policies, video monitoring, and in special cases, biometric type secu-
rity.

Information  security,  though,  begins  with  the  employee,  and  it
begins as being part of our code of business conduct that every em-
ployee has to read and sign off on each year. We segment our inter-
nal  network  connections  from  our  external  network  connections
using  various  security  technologies  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  our
networks.  We  keep  our  internal  core  business  network  separate
from  the  general  employee  network,  and  we  use  virus  protection
software, of course, on all of our PCs as well as our e-mail servers.
Proactive  vulnerability  scanning  is  a  key  part  of  our  strategy,
and  it  is  something  that  we  do  on  a  daily  basis.  SBC  maintains
close  ties  to  government  agencies  responsible  for  national  security.
We  work  closely  with  them  on  a  daily  basis  to  receive  and  share
security-related  information.  Examples  are  the  National  Security
Telecommunications  Advisory  Council,  the  National  Coordinating
Center  Telecom  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Center,
Infragard, and the National Security Information Exchange.

Continued  government  focus  on  security  standards  and  collabo-
rative  support  organizations  is  seen  positively  by  SBC;  providing
research  assistance,  grants,  and  funds  to  focus  the  information
technology  industry  to  work  towards  security  standards  and  best
practices  is  absolutely  necessary.  It  is  important  that  the  govern-
ment  provides  to  the  critical  industries  that  are  part  of  our  infra-
structure  the  best  practices  that  they  learn  from  their  own  cyber
security agencies.

Society  in  the  21st  century  is  rapidly  changing  with  increasing
reliance on information technologies. Users expect that they be mo-
bile and that they have access to the Internet and e-mail wherever
they are. Providing secure services in the environment becomes in-
creasingly important and challenging. Federal programs could help
educate and assist consumers to understand their roles and respon-
sibilities in a connected world.

As recognized by the Department of Homeland Security, the Na-
tion  is  dependent  on  the  critical  infrastructure  of  communications,
banking  and  finance,  power,  food,  health,  information  technology,
and  others.  A  disruption  to  any  component  of  those  affects  the
whole  infrastructure.  Securing  against  disruptions  of  any  compo-
nent is a best interest of all of us.

The  communication  industry  is  also  increasingly  dependent  on
application and information technology vendors to ensure the prod-
ucts they provide are of the highest quality and integrity. Software
and  hardware  that  does  not  meet  industry  standards  or  best  prac-
tices  require  additional  efforts  and  expense  to  meet  its  expected
function.  Vendors  that  provide  software  or  hardware  with  security

vulnerabilities  that  must  be  continually  monitored,  reviewed,
patched  drain  on  a  company’s  resources  and  a  liability  to  compa-
nies that must ensure the integrity of their own systems, data, and
services.

As a result, cyber security must become a priority in the creation
of  new  information  technologies.  To  date,  security  components  are
often  an  afterthought.  I  mean,  you  can  look  at  cellular  and  Wi-fi
when  they  first  came  out  in  the  ability  to  intercept  calls,  clone
phones, and data snooping where they could occur.

Internet protocol-based services wrestle constantly with the need
to  traverse  the  same  network  paths  where  unscrupulous  persons
may have the ability to interfere, impede, or intrude on the service
itself.  IP-based  services  must  find  new  ways  to  protect  the  content
of each packet that is carried and delivered in the shared Internet
world.  SBC  is  committed  to  work  with  the  information  industry  to
help  build  the  next  generation  of  Internet-based  voice  and  video
and data services securely.

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  your  assistance
to focus industry attention on cyber security is greatly appreciated.
We encourage the Department of Homeland Security to continue to
support research grants and assistance that focus on national cyber
security,  to  support  industry  organizations  and  government  agen-
cies  that  create  security  standards  and  best  practices,  to  continue
to  provide  early  warnings  of  security  events  through  various  gov-
ernment agencies, and to make sure that the government-identified
security  best  practices  are  shared  with  our  private,  critical  infra-
structure industries.

I would like to add that you make sure that our laws carry seri-
ous  penalties  for  cyber  security  issues  and  that  the  instigators  are
prosecuted  to  the  full  extent  of  the  law.  It  must  become  a  major
crime. It is no longer just kids playing with computers. It is a real
threat and the attacks are serious.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  here  today.  The  work
you  are  doing  is  critical  to  our  future  as  a  nation.  Cyber  terrorism
is a real threat, and we must stay diligent.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Geisse follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANDREW M. GEISSE

Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon  and  Members  of  the

Committee.

I  am  pleased  to  represent  SBC  Communications  on  this  panel  focused  on  cyber

security within our nation’s critical industries.

SBC  has  a  long  history  of  providing  reliable  communication  services.  SBC  pro-
vides  voice  and  data  communications  services  as  a  local  exchange  carrier  within
thirteen  states  and  nationally  with  long  distance,  data  and  Internet  services.  We
also  have  a  national  wireless  presence  in  Cingular  Wireless  in  a  partnership  with
BellSouth. We recognize the importance of our nation’s critical communication infra-
structure  and  the  role  it  plays  for  the  protection  of  the  United  States  and  its  citi-
zens. Integrity and reliability of our networks have been historic cornerstones of the
communications industry.

As society becomes more and more dependent on information technology, cyber se-
curity  must  be  a  priority  to  protect  the  services  provided  by  those  same  resources.
How  does  the  communications  sector  depend  on  public  and  private  infor-
mation systems?

SBC  well  understands  the  strong  connection  between  communications  security

and information technology, or what is commonly referred to as cyber security.

Behind  the  networks  that  move  voice  and  data,  are  many  applications,  private
networks, and computing resources. These resources support the operations, admin-
istration,  maintenance,  and  provisioning  services  of  our  telecommunications  infra-
structure. These information systems and networks provide SBC and other carriers
the  ability  to  manage  this  complex  industry  supporting  the  dial  tone  and  Internet
connections  that  we  have  all  come  to  expect  as  a  part  of  our  daily  lives.  Securing
these cyber resources to ensure the integrity and availability of communications net-
works is a role that SBC takes seriously, as part of its corporate culture.

SBC uses many vendor products within its information technology infrastructure.
In that regard, SBC is dependent on vendor product development in the private sec-
tor  and  delivery  of  private  sector  services  and  materials  to  support  the  information
technology  services  of  the  infrastructure.  In  this  manner,  SBC  relies  on  vendors  to
incorporate  cyber  security  best  practices,  standard  interfaces,  and  administrative
tools  within  their  products.  SBC  is  also  reliant  on  vendors  to  ensure  their  software
products can be patched easily to prevent existence of long-term vulnerabilities.

In  support  of  the  private  sector,  SBC  provides  managed  security  services  as  a
product offering. These types of services include: risk reviews and analysis, firewall
installation and monitoring, and firewall and intrusion prevention/detection reseller
for other vendor products.

For  the  consumer  space,  SBC’s  Internet  Services  organization  through  our  rela-
tionship  with  Yahoo!  provides  security  tools  to  our  Internet  Services  customers  as
part  of  their  Internet  experience.  In  this  manner,  SBC  supports  cyber  security  to
the consumer so they can better protect their home information technologies, which
in turn provides less problems to the shared Internet space.

Other  areas  where  SBC  has  focused  on  consumer  cyber  security  is  as  a  founding
member  of  the  Internet  NOC  Hotline,  which  connects  key  U.S.  and  International
ISPs. SBC is also a founding member of the Global Infrastructure Alliance for Inter-
net Security.

An  area  where  SBC  would  recommend  government  focus  is  on  the  education  of
the consumers regarding cyber security matters. End users must recognize they are
part of the interconnected world. When end-users do not understand how virus and
worm propagation can impact their home PCs, the result is a negative effect at the
Internet  level.  This  impact  is  caused  through  a  variety  of  malicious  activities,  in-
cluding,  SPAM  e-mails  and  bot-networks.  Educational  awareness  programs  should
advise users on anti-virus protection and identity theft protection.
What steps is SBC taking to secure its systems?

At SBC, we implement physical and cyber security measures that protect both our
customer-serving  network  facilities  and  our  internal  information  services.  Physical
security  measures  include  guard  services,  card  key  technologies,  visible  badge  poli-
cies, video monitoring, and, in special cases, bio-metric technologies.

Information  security  begins  with  a  cyber  security  policy  that  is  part  of  our  Cor-
porate  Code  of  Business  Conduct.  We  segment  our  internal  network  connections
from  external  networks  using  various  security  technologies  to  ensure  the  integrity
of our network. We keep our internal core business networks separate from the gen-
eral  employee  network.  Virus  protection  software  is  deployed  as  standard  on
desktops  and  e-mail  servers.  Pro-active  vulnerability  scanning  is  performed  con-
stantly to identify potential areas of risk.

SBC maintains close ties to government agencies responsible for national security.
We  work  closely  with  them  on  a  daily  basis  to  receive  and  share  security  related
information.  Examples  are  the  National  Security  Telecommunications  Advisory
Council  (NSTAC),  National  Coordinating  Center  Telecom  Information  Sharing  and
Analysis  Center  (NCC  Telecom  ISAC),  Infragard,  and  the  National  Security  Infor-
mation Exchange (NSIE).

Internally,  SBC  has  several  organizations  dedicated  to  the  security  of  our  assets.
Organizations such as our National Security/Emergency Preparedness organization,
our Asset Protection organization, and our Corporate Information Security organiza-
tion,  work  to  protect  our  customers  information  and  services,  our  employees,  and
our internal networks and data on a daily basis.

Our  SBC  Labs  business  unit  works  closely  with  technology  vendors,  academic
communities,  and  government  standards  organizations,  to  partner  and  share  infor-
mation  on  new  technologies.  Cyber  security  standards  are  always  a  priority  in  fu-
ture service and technology development and a focus of our internal auditing organi-
zation as well as external security audits.

Continued  Government  focus  on  security  standards  and  collaborative  support  or-
ganizations  is  seen  positively  by  SBC.  Providing  research  assistance,  grants,  and
funds  to  focus  the  information  technology  industry  to  work  towards  security  stand-
ards  and  best  practices  is  necessary.  It  is  important  that  the  Government  provides

55

to  the  critical  infrastructure  industries  the  learnings  and  best  practices  that  its
cyber security agencies learn.

Legislation  should  not  always  be  necessary  to  bring  industry  attention  to  tech-
nical  priorities.  However,  providing  research  assistance,  grants,  and  funds  to  focus
the  information  technology  industry  to  work  towards  security  standards  and  best
practices is necessary.
What  are  the  possible  consequences  for  the  communication  sector  of  dis-
ruption or attack on information systems?

Society  in  the  21st  century  is  rapidly  changing  with  increasing  reliance  on  infor-
mation  technologies.  Users’  expectations  are  that  they  be  mobile  and  have  instant
access  to  the  Internet  and  their  e-mail.  Providing  secure  services  in  this  environ-
ment becomes increasingly important and challenging. Federal programs could help
educate and assist consumers to understand their roles and responsibilities in a con-
nected world.

To  illustrate:  Consider  how  often  people  stop  for  gas  and  use  a  payment  card  at
the  pumps  for  convenience.  The  payment  card  transactions  must  be  carried  effi-
ciently, reliably, and securely across communications networks. This is to ensure the
gas  vendor,  the  payment  card  vendor,  and  the  customer  are  all  satisfied  that  the
transaction occurred to everyone’s expectation.

The  networks,  the  applications,  and  the  information  systems  that  are  necessary
to  complete  transactions  of  this  nature  are  part  of  our  society  on  a  daily  basis.
Cyber security is necessary to ensure the integrity of those transactions. Disruptions
within the communications sector can impact these, and other, daily activities.

Consider the impact of disrupted or unreliable communications to everyday needs,
including  how  patients  obtain  collaborative  health  care  between  multiple  providers
and  locations.  Communications  plays  ever  increasing  importance  to  health  indus-
tries,  emergency  first  responders,  911  services,  law  enforcement,  banking,  power,
and other parts of our society that serve critical functions.

With the growing use of wireless technologies, we must recognize that those wire-
less systems still rely on an underlying physical transport, use of back-end systems
and applications that may interconnect with other carriers. As we have recently wit-
nessed  in  New  Orleans  and  the  Gulf  Coast,  if  the  supporting  infrastructure  is  dis-
rupted,  communication  fails.  A  cyber  disruption  could  cause  similar  impacts  as  a
physical disruption.

While we recognize that other critical infrastructure industries are reliant on the
communications  industry  to  provide  the  network  and  communication  services,  we
also recognize that we, as an industry, are reliant on those other industries. We re-
quire  industries  such  as  electricity  and  gas,  banking  and  finance,  health,  and  gov-
ernment, to also function securely and without disruption to ensure the integrity of
our communications infrastructure.

As recognized by the Department of Homeland Security, the Nation is dependent
on  the  critical  infrastructure  of  communications,  banking  and  finance,  power,  food,
health,  information  technology  and  others.  A  disruption  to  any  component  affects
the  whole  infrastructure.  Securing  against  disruptions  to  any  component  is  in  the
best interest of all.
In  what  areas  are  current  cyber  security  technical  solutions  for  the  com-
munications  sector  inadequate?  Where  is  further  research  needed  to  miti-
gate existing and emerging threats and vulnerabilities?

The  communications  industry  is  also  increasingly  dependent  on  application  and
information technology vendors to ensure the products they provide are of the high-
est quality and integrity. Software and hardware that does not meet industry secu-
rity  best  practices  and  standards  require  additional  efforts  and  expense  to  meet  its
expected  function.  Vendors  that  provide  software  or  hardware  with  security
vulnerabilities  that  must  constantly  be  monitored,  reviewed,  and  patched,  are  a
drain  on  a  company’s  resources  and  a  liability  to  companies  that  must  ensure  the
integrity of their systems, data, and services.

SBC works diligently with software vendors that provide the foundation of the in-
formation  technology  infrastructure  to  ensure  necessary  software  security  patches
are installed to protect our complex environment. Continued focus from the Federal
Government on industry standards for secure information technology products is ap-
preciated  and  desired.  This  will  help  to  ensure  that  better  security  and  quality  is
an objective of the software, network and computer hardware industries.

NIST  (National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology)  is  one  example  of  a  col-
laborative  organization  that  has  been  helpful  in  promoting  information  security  re-
quirements  through  its  various  research  and  standards  efforts.  We,  as  a  business,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:26 Mar 14, 2006 Jkt 023332 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\091505\23332 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

look  to  leverage  those  standards  as  potential  baselines  in  our  efforts  and  are  glad
to see vendors meet such useful guidelines.
How  should  federal  agencies,  such  as  DHS,  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion,  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  and  the  Defense
Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  and  the  academic  researchers  work
with industry to define priorities for and support research in these areas?
Cyber  security  must  become  a  priority  in  the  creation  of  new  information  tech-
nologies.  To  date,  security  components  for  information  technologies  often  appeared
to be an afterthought. Examples of this can be seen in early versions of cellular and
Wi-Fi  technologies,  where  calls  could  be  intercepted,  cell  phones  cloned,  and  data
snooping could occur.

Internet Protocol (IP) based services wrestle constantly with the need to traverse
the same network paths where unscrupulous persons may have the ability to inter-
fere, impede, or intrude on the service itself. IP based services must find new ways
to  protect  the  content  of  each  packet  that  is  carried  and  delivered  in  this  shared
Internet world.

We  have  all  seen  that  virus  and  worm  attacks  have  risen  over  the  past  several
years.  Research  focus  on  how  to  prevent  the  distribution  of  malicious  content
through  virus,  worms,  and  e-mail  should  be  a  high  priority  for  all  industries  that
use the Internet for communications and business. The ability to detect and remove
unwanted  data  content  and  attacks  as  it  progresses  through  the  network  is  more
desirable  than  expecting  each  end  device  to  have  the  same  ability  to  protect  itself
from its neighbors on the networks.

Admittedly,  security  requirements  interfere  with  convenience  of  the  product  or
service  offered.  However,  we  need  cyber  security  and  software  development  stand-
ards that insist new technologies embrace security as part of their evolution and de-
velopment.  In  this  way,  society  as  a  whole  benefits  through  improved  assurance  of
integrity, reliability, service, and subsequent reduced resource costs to support those
services.

SBC is committed to work with the information industry to build the next genera-

tion of Internet-based voice, video and data communications, securely.
What are the most critical responsibilities of the Department of Homeland
Security  (DHS)  in  cyber  security  for  the  communications  sector  and  what
are  the  most  urgent  steps  the  new  Assistant  Secretary  for  Cyber  Security
and Telecommunications should take?

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  your  assistance  to  focus  industry
attention on cyber security is greatly appreciated. We encourage the Department of
Homeland Security to continue:

rity,

• to  support  research  grants  and  assistance  that  focus  on  National  cyber  secu-
• to  support  industry  organizations  and  government  agencies  that  create  secu-
• to continue to provide early warnings of security events, through various gov-
• and to make sure the security best practices that various critical government

rity standards and best practices,

ernment agencies,

agencies develop are shared with our critical infrastructure industries.

I  would  like  to  add  that  you  should  make  sure  our  laws  carry  serious  penalties
for  cyber  security  issues  and  that  the  instigators  are  prosecuted  to  the  full  extent
of the law. It must become a major crime. It is no longer just kids playing with com-
puters. The attacks are serious.

Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. The work you are doing
is  critical  to  our  future  as  a  nation.  Cyber  terrorism  is  a  real  threat  and  we  must
stay diligent.

DISCUSSION

you.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  thank  all  of

You  know,  one  of  the  dangers  of  a  hearing  dealing  with  a  sen-
sitive subject like this is that we provide fire for tabloid trash. And
I  darn  sure  don’t  want  to  go  to  my  supermarket  checkout  counter
next  week,  and  I  do  the  grocery  shopping  incidentally,  and  read  a
headline  that  says,  you  know,  ‘‘Science  Committee  Warns  Cyber
Katrina Imminent.’’

Now  having  said  that,  and  taking  that  risk,  using  DHS’s  own
color-coding  system,  I  would  say  the  threat  is,  at  a  minimum,  at
best, yellow, and perhaps even orange.

My question to all of you is do you think collectively, one, the pri-
vate  sector  gets  it  and  understands  the  full  dimensions  and  impli-
cations,  and  two,  the  government  understands  the  full  dimensions
and potential implications?

Let me ask each of you. Mr. Geisse?
Mr. GEISSE. Yes, Chairman Boehlert.
I  believe  the  private  sector  understands  it  is  critical,  and  I  also

do believe the government does as well.

But  I  think  it  is  sometimes  an  afterthought  in  the  sense  that  it
is more of a technology issue and it is not only a technology issue.
It  is  truly  a  part  of  our  critical  infrastructure  and  something  that
we have to be focused on as a country.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Freese.
Mr.  FREESE.  I  think  both  the  government  and  the  private  sector
understand  the  issues.  I  see  some  basic  fundamental  problems,
though,  in  addressing  these  issues  as  a  combined  force.  Just  as  I
referred to in my comments, information sharing with DHS has got
to  be  extremely  frustrating  for  them.  They  ask  for  information  on
critical  infrastructure  assets.  We  can’t  provide  that,  because  there
is no way that they can protect that information. It stalls the whole
process.

Chairman BOEHLERT. So it is very necessary for the government
and  the  private  sector  to  cooperate,  but  you  don’t  have  the
confidence——

Mr. FREESE. Absolutely.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.—that  the  information  you  share,  and  that
is  very  important  information  to  determine  vulnerability  and  re-
sponse capability. You are concerned about providing that, because
you  are  concerned  about  the  security  of  sharing  proprietary  infor-
mation—all right.

Mr. FREESE. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
And that has been going on for a couple of years now.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, we are going to change it.
Mr. Kepler.
Mr.  KEPLER.  Yes,  I  think  industry  has  put  the  time  into  this
thing  and  understands  the  risks-based  approach.  The  concern  I
would have is that there is a lot of problems in cyber security and
are  we  focused  on  getting  the  right  solutions  for  the  major  issues
so  at  the  end  you  can  work  on  everything  and  not  be  effective  in
anything.  And  I  think  we  really  have  to  be  focused  on  the  major,
national impacts as a first wave of fixing things.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Leggate.
Mr.  LEGGATE.  I  would  say,  in  my  experience,  that  most  boards
get it. Most boards who run serious companies understand their de-
pendency,  in  this  age,  on  this  whole  digital  environment.  So  that,
I think, is done.

Whether  small  businesses  understand  the  services  that  they

need for everyday transactions, I am not sure about that.

On  the  government  level,  I  would  say  in  the  United  States,
maybe—who  understand  entirely  departmentally  the  issue.  Where
the  challenge  comes,  I  think,  is  to  put  this  into  practical  action  in
a  timely  way  and  to  then  set  a  set  of  priorities  become  of—almost
a  national  plan  to  do  things  very  quickly  in  a  focused  way,  not
across  a  whole  landscape,  but  just  nail  the  big  issues.  And  to  me,
that is where the gap is.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Yes. And let me ask, and one of the lessons
learned from Katrina is diffused responsibility. Everybody’s respon-
sibility  tends  to  be  no  one’s  responsibility.  Where  would  you  sug-
gest the focal point should be? I am encouraged, as I hope you are,
that the Secretary has announced the creation of an Assistant Sec-
retary  for  Cyber  Security  and  Telecommunications.  Would  that  be
the  focal  point?  I  mean,  there  is  somebody  that  has  to  be  sort  of
at  the  center  of  coordinating  all  of  these  activities.  You  can’t  have
14  people  the  center  of  coordination,  because  they  don’t  coordinate
amongst themselves.

Where would you suggest that be?
Mr. Leggate.
Mr.  LEGGATE.  Well,  I  would  separate  the  notion  of  coordination
from accountability. So coordination is a fine thing to do, and done
well  is  good.  But  where  do  we  look  for  the  ultimate  accountability
for the service level we get from the Internet? To whom do we look
of that? And so I think big steps to go forward to improve coordina-
tion,  but  I  do  think  at  some  level  we  must  actually  break  through
into accountabilities that isn’t visible today.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Kepler.
Mr. KEPLER. Yes. I think information technology is pervasive, so
the idea that you would have a focused effort on cyber security, we
think,  is  exactly  correct.  But  to  John  Leggate’s  point  is  that  when
you  think  about  emergency  response,  you  think  about  physical  se-
curing  of  critical  infrastructure.  Those  also  have  Internet  impacts.
So  the—you  can’t  separate  all  of  these  things  in  the  Departments
and  have  them  link  together.  You  have  to  have  coordination  but
then  recognition  that  these  bodies  really  have  to  work  together  to
come  with—come  up  with  common  capabilities  to,  you  know,  de-
fend, protect, and respond.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Freese.
Mr. FREESE. I agree. I think the coordination, I think, should lie
at that new position’s role. But again, and I may sound like a bro-
ken  record  here,  but  if  there  is  going  to  be  a  coordination  point,
there has to be representation, and strong representation, from the
private  sector  to  assist  in  that  coordination,  because  I  have  seen
too  many  times  in  the  past,  it  looks  like  a  good  thing  to  do  from
an overall perspective, but it is not focused to where it really needs
to be.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Geisse.

Mr.  GEISSE.  Well,  I  think  you  brought  up  a  good  point,  Mr.
Chairman.  I  think  we  have  lots  of  agencies  focused  on  cyber  secu-
rity, but we don’t have a single, real focal point. And maybe by the
Department of Homeland Security setting this up, it should help do
that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. So I would take it that your reaction is the
same  as  mine:  the  welcoming  of  the  announcement  by  the  Sec-
retary  that  we  are  going  to  have  a  new  Assistant  Secretary  for
Cyber Security and Telecommunications, the sooner the better.

Mr. GEISSE. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. But that is progress. We are moving in the

right direction.

The  red  light  is  on  for  me.  And  I  have  got  to  practice  what  I

preach, so I have got to shut up and now recognize Mr. Gordon.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  because  we  do  have  that  red  light,  in  all  due  respect,  I
would  like  for  you  to  try  to  be  crisp  in  your  answers.  And  let  me
tell  you,  I  want  to  ask  each  of  our  industry  sector  representatives
to tell me what they think about how vulnerable your sector might
be  to  a  serious,  focused,  cyber  attack;  what  could  be  the  con-
sequences  of  that  attack  for  your  industry;  and  what  role  would
you  suggest  for  Homeland  Security  or  other  parts  of  the  Federal
Government  in  trying  to  help  you  develop  a  plan  and  also  more
preferably, avoid that, and then if there is something that happens,
the recovery?

And  while  you  are  thinking  about  that,  let  me  quickly  ask  a

question for Mr. Purdy.

Mr.  Purdy,  I  recognize  you  are  just  recently  been  appointed  the
Acting Director of the agency, and so all of the either omissions or,
probably  more  likely,  the  low  priority  that  the  agency  has  placed
toward cyber security over the last four years can’t be laid at your
feet. But it seems like your testimony mostly was a litany of things
you  want  to  do  or  you  are  starting  to  do  and  that,  really,  the  only
plans  are  really  just  a  framework  document.  This  is  concurred  by
the  General  Accounting  Office,  which  had  a  report  this  summer
that said the DHS has not yet developed national cyber threat and
vulnerability  assessments  or  government  industry  contingency  re-
covery  plans  for  cyber  security.  And  so  my  really  simple  question
is, when do you estimate these assessments and recovery plans will
be in place?

Mr.  PURDY.  Well,  attempting  to  comply  with  your  request  that
we be succinct, let me say that I am proud to associate myself with
the  activity  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  since  it  was
set up. I worked on the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace on
the  White  House  staff  and  then  came  over  to  the  Department  to
help set up this agency, and I have been Acting Director since Oc-
tober of last year.

We  have  made  tremendous  progress  in  building  our  watching

warning capability——

Mr. GORDON. Yes, and I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but I said
one simple question. When do you estimate that these assessments
and recovery plans will be in place?

Mr.  PURDY.  We  have  a  couple  different  levels.  The  fundamental
response  to  attacks  is  the  ESF–2,  is  the  communications  piece,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:26 Mar 14, 2006 Jkt 023332 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\091505\23332 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

61

which  is  we  have  a  close  partnership  with  NCS  and  NCSD,  that
is  in  place.  It  is  operational.  There  is  a  long  history  of  the
communications——

Mr. GORDON. Was it in place when the General Accounting Office

did their report this summer?

Mr. PURDY. Yes, it was.
Mr. GORDON. Well, they didn’t seem to think it was in place.
Mr.  PURDY.  Well,  reading  the  entire  GAO  report,  there  is  a  rec-

ognition of tremendous progress we have made——

Mr. GORDON. Recently.
Mr. PURDY.—in a number of places.
Mr. GORDON. Right. Recently.
Mr.  PURDY.  And  the  ESF–2  is  a  long-standing  product  of  a  pub-
lic/private  partnership  with  the  private  sector  that  has  stood  the
test  of  time,  and  we  are  proud  to  be  associated  with  that.  The  ac-
tual  assessment  of  risk  is  part  of  the  National  Infrastructure  Pro-
tection  Plan.  The  base  plan  will  be  out  later  this  year,  and  each
individual sector is working on developing——

Mr.  GORDON.  You  said  the  base  plan.  That  will  still  just  be  the

Mr.  PURDY.  Yeah,  the  federal  plan,  the  more  detailed  guidance

framework?

of——

Mr. GORDON. But again, I just had a very simple question. When
do  you  estimate  these  assessments  and  recovery  plans  will  be  in
place?

Mr.  PURDY.  There  are  two  different  elements.  There  is  the  as-

sessment and there is recovery.

Mr. GORDON. Okay.
Mr.  PURDY.  The  National  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan  is  part
of  the  assessment.  We  are  also,  within  the  Information  Analysis
and  Infrastructure  Protection  Division,  doing  a  risk  assessment  of
cyber  that  is  one  of  the  priority  efforts  to  fuse  intelligence,  to  map
the threat against the risk. So that is going to be ready very soon.
The  National  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan,  the  risk  assessment
piece,  will  be  early  next  year  as  to  when  that  part  of  the  assess-
ment is completed.

Mr.  GORDON.  Right.  Thank  you.  I  just  didn’t  want  to  take  time

from these other folks.

Now, if you could, I would like to hear about your sectors.
Mr. LEGGATE. Okay. Let me speak for that.
I  answer  your  question  in—although  it  is  a  simple  question,  in

The  first  one  is  today,  2005,  I  will  take  a  point  in  time  in  2007
or 2008. So given we are still in the process of migration from pri-
vate networks to the Internet, the consequences would be moderate
in  the  near-term,  because  we  haven’t  fully  migrated  to  the  new
way. I would suggest to you that by 2007 and 2008, this is the tip-
ping  point  when  most  the  business  will  run  that  way.  And  at  that
point, I would suggest, it might be catastrophic.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  is  there  a  role  for  the  United  States  Federal
Government  to  play  in  helping  you  avoid  catastrophe  or  to  recover
from it if it did occur?

Mr.  LEGGATE.  I  think,  absolutely,  going  back  to  the  Chairman’s
remarks  about  setting  up  a  new  post  within  the  Department,  I

two ways.

think  the  issue  is  to  make  progress  and  retain  focus  to  put  things
in place in the near time frame rather than taking five or six years
to move to a better place.

Mr.  KEPLER.  Yes,  if  you  take  the  first  point,  which  is  what  I  do
believe  is  a  major  risk  or  consequence  here,  if  communications,
both  voice  and  the  Internet,  is  the  key  vulnerability  in  my  mind
and  risk.  If  communication  stops,  commerce  stops.  And  if  commu-
nications isn’t there, you can’t recover. So really, looking at a major
catastrophic  failure  in  communications  is  really  the  real  critical
issue,  in  my  mind,  around  cyber  security.  And  so  when  you  ap-
proach  that,  what  are  the  major  risk  areas  for  that  to  happen  we
will  have  to  address,  and  not  only  recover  and  response,  but  part
of addressing with risk is containment and mitigation. So when we
have  those  risks,  we  do  see  parts  of  the  infrastructure  fail,  but  we
can’t  have  it  cascade  and  completely  fail.  So  how  do  you  contain
those  failures  is  something  that  we  need  to  work  on,  and  that
needs to be collectively done between the government and industry
to model those threats and to come up with response positions.

Mr. FREESE. From the electric sector, it measures very well with
what  he  is  saying.  The  telecommunications  infrastructure  and  the
electric  infrastructure  are  very  closely  matched.  A  problem  with
telecommunications  will  impact  the  electric  control  systems,  in
most cases. If I look at it strictly from an electric company—or elec-
tric  sector  perspective,  we  are  vulnerable  to  an  undetermined  ex-
tent  based  on  the  number  of  utilities  that  are  in  the  country  and
the  number—the  amount  of  information  that  is  shared  even  be-
tween utilities is very scarce. I can say if we have network security
in  place,  if  we  have  our  communications  security  in  place,  we  are
all right. But I don’t know how many of the companies are in that
situation.  I  would  say  the  government  can  assist  with  that  by,  as
I  mentioned,  keeping  the  R&D  programs  with  the  Idaho  National
Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Sandia in place, and working
on cyber solutions that we need now. I mean, research and develop-
ment  for  long-term  solutions  is  great,  but  we  have  some  pressing
issues now.

Mr.  GEISSE.  I  guess  I  would  add,  for  the  communications  indus-
try, it is very similar to the other industries with one exception. We
keep our network, general purpose type network for our customers,
independent and separate of the Internet network to try to prevent
that sort of issue to begin with.

And  I  think  you  also  asked  what  do  we  do  about  it  if  that  hap-
pens,  we  have  a  very  focused  effort,  something  that  we  constantly
test  and  for  disaster  recovery.  If  we  have  a  disaster  like  that,  how
do we bring up a duplicate, for example, network operations center.
We have duplication throughout our network to prevent it.

I think the government can help in a lot of ways. One is hearings
like  this  that  put  some  focus  on  it  are  important.  I  think  doing
R&D and research is important. But I also think, from my own per-
spective, there are reasons for these attacks, and you need to start
treating them just like you are treating terrorists and other things
and actually go after them and prevent it before it happens.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you very much.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
The gentleman’s time has expired.

And before I turn to the eloquent Mr. Akin, just let me point out
the  private  sector.  All  of  your  affiliations  have  active  lobbying  ef-
forts  on  Capitol  Hill.  And  my  experience  with  lobbyists;  they  are
very  valuable  assets.  They  provide  additional  information  to  us,
and hopefully we listen to both sides of the story, but that you have
got  to  attach  a  higher  priority  to  lobbying  the  Congress,  our  col-
leagues  outside  this  committee,  who  don’t  really  understand  the
full dimensions of this yet to, when you call on the Members, advo-
cate  for  more  R&D,  for  example,  into  cyber  security,  for  better  co-
ordination, for more attention.

And  so  please  carry  that  back  to  your  hired  guns,  so  to  speak.
And  I  use  that  as  a  positive  not  a  pejorative.  But  you  have  got  to
focus on the importance of this subject. And tomorrow’s papers will
come  out.  The  evening  news  will  come  out.  Then  this  won’t  even
be  mentioned  anyplace,  because,  as  I  say,  in  most  quarters  it  is
greeted  with  a  muffled  yawn,  and  yet  we  know,  you  know  in  your
sharing  with  us,  how  important  this  is  and  the  potential  impact  it
could have on our entire economy.

So with that, let me turn to the always eloquent Mr. Akin.
Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  will  try  not  to  be  too  long  in  my  eloquence  here.  I  just  had  a

couple of quick questions.

And  let  me  explain  where  I  am  coming  from.  I  am  also  serving
on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  and  one  of  the  things  that  the
House is doing is trying to do a complete analysis of where we are
relative  to  defense  and  all.  So  my  questions  are  more  directed  to-
ward a situation where somebody, even a major nation state, might
try to precipitate some coordinated attack in this area.

So my first question is kind of a simple one. After September 11,
cell  phones  and  phones  became  pretty  much  inoperative.  Was  that
because of the volume of traffic?

Mr.  GEISSE.  I  guess  I  will  answer  that  one,  Congressman  Akin.
Are you talking about specifically in New York?
Mr.  AKIN.  Well,  actually,  here  in  DC,  cell  phones  were  useless.

You couldn’t get a call or anything.

Mr.  GEISSE.  I  am  not  familiar  with  that,  but  my  guess  I  mean,
the reality is of how those networks are designed, there is a limited
amount of frequency that you get from the Federal Government for
those  networks,  and  as  a  result,  a  limited  number  of  calls  you  can
do at any one time. And I imagine the call volumes were way high
that day.

Mr. AKIN. So consequently, that would jam everything up?
Mr.  GEISSE.  Well,  I  am  sure  there  is  a  certain  amount  of  calls
that would get through. But one of the things that we do that you
may  not  be  aware  of  is  for  the  Federal  Government,  in  an  emer-
gency  like  that,  we  reserve  a  certain  amount  of  the  network  for
them, from a priority perspective for calls.

Mr.  AKIN.  Okay.  Now  let  us  say  that  we  are  talking  about  more
this organized sort of attack type of situation. First of all, just sim-
ply how vulnerable are we? And second of all, what are some of the
first things that you would do to try to protect against that?

Mr.  GEISSE.  As  part  of  the  co-chairs  of  the  National  Cyber  Re-
sponse  Coordination  Group  in  Department  of  Defense,  and  their
representatives  include  those  from  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  and

the Joint Task Force on Global Network Operations, we have been
doing  tabletop  exercises  among  the  membership  at  the  National
Defense University to make sure we have the communication paths
and processes in place to make sure we have a coordinated govern-
ment response to such attacks.

Mr. AKIN. Anybody else want to take a shot at that?
Mr. KEPLER. I would just say that when you get prepared for the
scenario  you  are  talking  about,  you  have  to  worry  about  diversity
before  you  start,  so  we  would  look  at  cell  phones,  land  lines,  pri-
ority  lines,  multiple  carriers,  Internet  communications,  so  the
whole  concept,  I  think  in  this  environment,  is  diversity  so  you  can
respond  over  whatever  happens  to  be  up  at  the  time.  That  is  the
key point in my mind.

Mr.  AKIN.  So  you  are  saying  have  enough  backup  kinds  of  sys-
tems that are going different ways that you could run things a dif-
ferent direction?

Mr.  KEPLER.  It  is  hard  in  scenario  planning  to  target  an  exact
backup.  That  is  why  I  think  diversification  of  different  types  of
routing,  circuitry,  different  methods,  whether  that  is  satellite  or
whatever, are pretty key, because then you would have to take out
different types of infrastructure, which is a challenge.

Mr.  GEISSE.  I  would  like  to  add  one  thing,  Congressman  Akin.
I  know  of  at  least  one  situation  that  is  public,  it  was  in  the  pri-
vate sector, where a cyber attack was used specifically to gather in-
formation from a competitor, so they put out a virus that basically
the  company  didn’t  even  know  was  there,  collected  data,  trans-
mitted  it  back.  And  so  I  think  that  type  of  attack  that  you  bring
up is very possible, and I think part of it is we have to start getting
proactive.  We  can’t  keep  sitting  back  and  preventing  after  we  see
the worm, after we see the virus. We have to start getting and cre-
ating  technologies  that  go  out  and  prevent  it  before  it  ever  hap-
pens.

Mr.  AKIN.  Right.  So  now  some  of  what  we  have  got  is  going  to
be software-related types of attacks. Some are going to be just sim-
ple  hardware  things  like,  you  know,  an  electromagnetic  pulse  or
something that is just simply blowing up a communications hub or
something, right? And so what you are saying is a diversity of ways
of  moving  information  is  probably  your  best—and  you  are  saying
that  we  are  making  some  progress  in  that  regard  or  that  we  still
have—what is your—what would you say would be our level of vul-
nerability? Could you just hit the system in a couple of places and
shut  the  country  down  or  would  it  be  pretty  hard  to  just  pick  sev-
eral things to do?

Mr.  FREESE.  From  the  communications  perspective,  as  it  applies
to  electricity,  you  could  shut  down  various  areas  and  regions.  I
don’t think you could shut down the entire country. That is a—that
is  kind  of  a  misconception.  You  could  take  out  a  significant  region
of power and communications, however.

Mr. AKIN. From an electric grid point of view?
Mr.  FREESE.  From  an  electric  and  a  communications  point  of

view.

Mr. AKIN. Yeah.

Mr.  FREESE.  I  don’t  think  you  would  have  an  entire  country
down  from  a  telecommunications  perspective  from  a  localized  at-
tack against a certain region.

Mr. AKIN. Again——
Mr. GORDON. Would the gentleman yield? Ask him how long. He

is going to be down for how long?

Mr. AKIN. Go ahead. Yeah.
Mr.  GORDON.  If  you  would.  I  mean,  you  say  we  would  be  down,

but for what period of time?

Mr. FREESE. Well, that depends on a lot of different things. It de-

pends on what you have for backup communications.

Mr.  GORDON.  Are  we  talking  minutes,  hours,  or  days,  or  weeks?
Mr. FREESE. I would say, in some cases, hours, some cases, days.
He would be better to tell you how long it would take telecommuni-
cations to come back up.

Mr. AKIN. Yes. You can go ahead and respond.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you.
Mr. GEISSE. Yes, sir.
From  a  communications  perspective  on  a  cyber  attack,  the  way
we do our networks, it wouldn’t affect the communications network
itself,  because  we  keep  it  independent.  But  what  it  does  impact  is
the systems we use to monitor it, to provision it, to make sure that
we  can  keep  the  network  up.  And  that  is  why  it  is  still  extremely
critical. And I think that Mr. Leggate made a point earlier on that
as the future goes on, and more and more things run on the Inter-
net  itself,  we  more  and  more  vulnerable  versus  the  separate  net-
works that we have today.

Mr.  AKIN.  So  to  some  degree,  the  lack  of  sophistication,  if  you
will,  or  the  duplication,  is  giving  us  a  lot  more  protection  than  we
would have in the future? That is a point several of you have made
then.

Yes.  Well,  I  think  my  time  has  expired,  and  I  don’t  want  to  be

excessively eloquent, so——

be excessively eloquent.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, all right. Fine. We will permit you to

But Mr. Purdy, you had your hand up.
Mr. PURDY. Yes. I just wanted to mention that in a major situa-
tion,  we  have  the  critical  infrastructure  warning  information  net-
work that is a survivable network connecting our Department with
various  critical  sectors  in  the  country,  including  electricity,  infor-
mation technology, and telecommunications, State Homeland Secu-
rity Advisors, sector-specific agencies, and resources in each critical
infrastructure,  and  we  are  building  out  that  network  to  greater
connectivity over time.

Chairman BOEHLERT. When the warning is issued, hopefully the
message  is  not  only  heard  but  heeded.  I  would  point  out  that  one
of  the  agencies  under  the  jurisdiction  of  this  committee  is  NOAA,
which  is  the  parent  agency  for  the  National  Weather  Service,  and
if you are looking for bright lights in the aftermath of Katrina, one
of  the  bright  lights  is  that  the  National  Weather  Service,  on  five
o’clock, on the Friday preceding the Monday morning when Katrina
actually  hit  land,  the  National  Weather  Service  put  out  an  alert,
a  weather  alert  that  a  category  four  or  five  hurricane  was  due  to
hit  within  72  hours.  That  went  to  every  emergency  responder,

portunity.

every  state  capitol,  every  major  city,  but  some  people  didn’t  pay
much attention.

Mr. Honda.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate this op-

There  are  two  arenas  I  would  like  to  just  bring  up,  and  it  has
been  touched  upon  a  little  bit.  But  one  is,  I  represent  Silicon  Val-
ley, and in our valley, we house the backup data and even the pri-
mary  data  of  many  businesses.  Perhaps  some  of  yours  are  housed
there.  And  maintaining  both  the  integrity  of  and  the  appropriate
access  to  this  data  is  essential  for  normal  operations.  But  in  the
event  of  not  only  a  cyber  attack,  you  have  made  some  comments
in  that  arena  and  physical  attack,  but  coupled  physical  and  cyber.
I  am  not  sure  that  that  was  discussed  very  fully.  And  also  a  re-
sponse  on  how  we  would  be  responding  to  a  natural  disaster.  And
I  bring  that  up,  because  my  valley  is  situated  between  the  San
Andreas  Fault  and  the  Hayward  Fault.  And  I  am  not  sure  that
that  kind  of  an  incident  or  occurrence  has  been  thought  of.  And
given  Katrina,  I  think  that  natural  disasters  we  found  that  some-
times  it  creates  a  lot  of  unintended  consequences  that  we  have  to
anticipate.
The other question is the information sharing and exchange, that
has always been something I have been concerned about since 9/11.
And  in  terms  of  cyber  security  and  information  exchange,  where
are we in the Department of Homeland Security in that effort? And
I would like to know what the private sector feels that we are, and
what  grade  would  you  give  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security
at this point in time? And then I suspect that we are going to have
a  new  Assistant  Secretary  of  Cyber  Security.  What  advice  would
you  give  that  person  at  this  point  in  time  relative  to  information
sharing?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KEPLER. Let me try to answer maybe a couple from my view.
The one point you made, if you think of weather systems, we are
getting  a  lot  better  at  modeling  hurricanes.  If  you  think  of  earth-
quakes,  we  are  getting  better,  but  not  nearly  to  the  sophistication.
To other external threats, we don’t have the same type of modeling
and  predictive  capabilities.  So  part  of  the  response  is  getting  that
predictive  capability.  So  we  really  need  to  think  about  that  as  we
go  forward  and  look  at  strengthening  that.  That  is  one  of  my——
Mr. HONDA. Does our—do we have a redundant system that will

accommodate all of those three areas?

Mr. KEPLER. Well, there are just a couple of areas we are talking
about.  One  is  the  prediction  so  you  can  become  better  prepared  in
stages. You go closer like you would. Another activity is to have di-
versification  of  your  infrastructure  and  recovery  protocols,  so  most
major companies are positioned to have recovery plans, crisis man-
agement  plans  in  place.  We  have  corporate  crisis  management
plans  since  the  late  ’80s.  When  9/11  occurred,  we  actually  invoked
that.  We  weren’t  majorly  impacted,  to  one  of  the  other  points  ear-
lier, some of the small businesses and structures that may not have
that level of sophistication.

I  think  it  is  also  a  challenge  in  terms  of  information  sharing,
which  is  critical  in  protecting  and  responding.  The  private  sector

is bound between antitrust laws and Freedom of Information issues
and  sharing  information.  That,  to  me,  is  a  critical  issue  that  we
still  need  to  balance  on.  So  while  you  are  trying  to  address  this
thing,  we  can  actually  be  non-compliant  with  other  laws.  So  how
we  really  focus  on  that  information  sharing  is  really  a  critical  as-
pect of it.

Mr. HONDA. Thank you.
Mr. FREESE. I would like to add something about the natural dis-

asters response you were talking about.

Even during Katrina, there was some extensive physical damage
to the electric infrastructure, to the communications infrastructure,
and  several  others.  Okay.  And  that  is  going  to  happen  regardless
of  what  type  of  natural  disaster  you  have  got.  So  what  your  main
concern  is,  at  that  point,  is  making  sure  that  those  problems  don’t
cascade  outside  of  the  immediately  affected  area.  And  I  think  it
was true testimony to everybody’s professionalism down there that
the  electric  sector  maintained  power  around  the  area.  There  were
no cascading failures. Communications was set up via the Internet
and  temporary  communications,  so  there  are  ways  to  do  this.  But
I don’t see a really good way around the physical damage, physical
destruction  of  the  infrastructure.  That  is  very  difficult  to  have  a
backup to outside of the affected area.

Mr.  HONDA.  And  in  the  affected  area,  was  there  a  replacement
system  that  took  place  of  the  current  power,  no  pun  intended,  not
electrical power, because people were afraid——

Mr. FREESE. No.
Mr. HONDA.—of electrocution?
Mr. FREESE. No, there was not. There were substations that were
damaged and put out of service. There were lines down. That type
of  physical  damage  just  takes  time  to  repair.  Now  there  are  ways
of  bringing  temporary  transformers  in,  those  types  of—getting  the
lines  back  up,  temporary  lines  run,  but  that,  of  course,  takes  time
and effort and significant funding.

Mr. HONDA. Would wireless and satellite connections replace that

loss of——

Mr. FREESE. From the communications perspective, yes.
Mr.  GEISSE.  Yes.  For  example,  in  Hurricane  Katrina,  one  of  the
first things we did is send down—we call them ‘‘cellular on wheels.’’
They  are  basically  cell  sites  that  are  built  into  a  truck.  We  sent
over 300 of those down there immediately for—so that we could set
up cellular service in Katrina.

Mr.  HONDA.  Was  that  private  sector  strategy  or  was  that

something——

Mr. GEISSE. Private sector strategy.
Mr.  HONDA.  And  is  that  something  that  we  should  look  at  in

terms of the government’s side?

Mr. GEISSE. Well, I guess here is my answer because I think your
question  is,  as  I  understand,  and  it  is  well  founded.  I  mean,  you
know,  we  have  had  many  disasters  in  California  from  the  fires
down  in  LA  to  the  mudslides  to  our  own  issues  with  flooding  and
weather. And we have response units within our company to go out
and  handle  those  types  of  situations  so  that  we  can  get  service  up
and repaired as quickly as possible. And it is not as simple as just
dropping  in  a  second  system,  because  really,  in  many  cases,  like,

68

for example, the fires down there, we had burned up wires that we
had  to  go  in  and  replace  and  put  up  and  running  and  working.  I
think  what  the  government  can  help  on  this,  and  I  think  it  has
been  brought  up  here  several  times,  is  start  focusing  this  as  a
major  issue  and  that  we  are  all  prepared,  as  different  industries,
to work together in a real disaster.

Mr. FREESE. If I may just finish up with one thing about the in-
formation exchange in DHS. As I mentioned earlier, that has been
a  problem  for  the  last  few  years,  and  I  am  not  sure  that  I  under-
stand  exactly  why,  because  DHS  has  a  PCII  program  developed
and  in  place.  This  was  essentially  going  to  let  private  industry
present information to the government that would be protected and
would  not  be  disclosed  without  the  private  industry’s  permission.
I am not sure where that stands right now. If Mr. Purdy could give
me an update on that program, I would appreciate it.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Mr.  Purdy,  and  then  we  will  go.  Mr.

Honda’s time is expired. We are generous.

Mr.  PURDY.  Yes,  the  PCII  program,  which  has  been  operating
under an interim rule since the time it went into effect, will be sub-
ject  to  a  final  rule.  It  is  under  current  consideration  by  the  DHS
General  Counsel,  Phil  Perry.  We  expect  that  revised  rule  to  come
out  momentarily.  But  in  the  meantime,  we  are  trying  to  facilitate
information  sharing,  building  on  some  key  legacy  organizations,
such as the NCC ISACs, the NCC generally, but we have leveraged
the source of information across the federal agencies, so we get bet-
ter  information  now,  and  now  we  can  share  it.  Plus,  we  have  en-
hanced  the  information  we  get  from  the  intelligence  and  the  law
enforcement  folks,  and  we  can  put  out  targeted  bulletins  to  the
technical or non-technical sector, to government or the private sec-
tor,  that  we  don’t  associate  with  the  source  of  the  information.  So
we  can  get  sensitive  law  enforcement-sensitive  information,  classi-
fied information that we can turn into actionable guidance. In addi-
tion,  we  are  building  a  North  American  Incident  Response  Group
of  private  sector  folks.  We  met  last  week  in  Silicon  Valley  with  a
number of companies out there. We have a meeting that is ongoing
right now in Arlington with a number of companies. We are trying
to build that capability. The ISACs, we met with the ISAC council
with  the  Assistant  Secretary  earlier  this  week.  The  sharing  of  in-
formation with the ISACs is a fundamentally important thing.

In  addition,  there  has  been  a  robust  sharing  among  ISACs  that
is  centered  by  the  IT  ISAC.  We  have  our  US–CERT  secure  portal
that  has  2,000  private  and  governmental  folks  involved  in  sharing
information  in  a  secure  environment.  We  are  going  to  tie  in  that
IT  ISAC  information  sharing,  because  we  believe  it  is  a  combina-
tion  of  building  trust,  giving  value,  because  we  have  a  major  pri-
vate sector retreat next week that the private sector is hosting. We
want  to  share  what  we  know,  what  of  that  do  they  want,  and  let
us accelerate the mechanisms for getting that information. Because
folks,  if  they  go  to  the  effort  or  decide  whether  to  go  to  the  effort
to share information, it is important to protect it, but it is also im-
portant  for  them  to  think  somebody  cares  about  it,  somebody  uses
it,  and  we  provide  value  back  to  the  private  sector.  And  we  are
committed to do that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Purdy.

The Chair recognizes Dr. Bartlett.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Leggate, in your written testimony, you note that businesses
and  governments  can  plan  for  expected  failures.  But  even  the  best
prepared  organizations  and  corporations  may  be  woefully  inad-
equate  in  responding  to  complex,  low-probability,  high-impact  fail-
ures. If a large-scale Internet outage or significant reduction in per-
formance  would  occur,  the  unexpected  effects  on  whole  sets  of  in-
dustries, utilities, and enterprise could have surprisingly large eco-
nomic  and  social  impacts.  For  the  few  moments  that  we  have,  I
would  like  to  engage  you  in  a  discussion  of  the  ultimate  low-prob-
ability,  high-impact  failure,  and  that  is  a  nuclear  EMP  attack  on
our country.

For several years, I have been concerned with this, and I got leg-
islation about three years ago to set up an EMP Commission which
acted for two years, chaired by Dr. Bill Graham, Rumsfeld’s deputy
in his emerging ballistic missile threat commission. They have now
issued  their  report.  Senator  John  Kyl  has,  in  the  last  few  weeks,
had  a  piece  in  the  Washington  Post  reflecting  his  concern  for  this.
Newt  Gingrich  and  his  colleague,  Bill  Forstchen,  have  written  a
fascinating  novel,  which  will  be  out  next  summer.  I  encourage  you
to  read  that.  It  is  called  ‘‘One  Second  After.’’  They  have  done  very
good  research.  It  is  quite  accurate.  Because  even  the  level  of  con-
cern may be classified, I will only tell you that within the Pentagon
now, there is a growing concern for a nuclear EMP attack.

The Russian generals can tell us things that I maybe cannot tell
you, because they would be classified, but the Russian generals tell
us  that  they  have  developed  a  nuclear  EMP  weapon  that  will
produce 200 kilovolts per meter, that a large weapon detonated 300
miles high over the center of our country, Iowa or Nebraska, would
blanket  the  whole  country,  and  at  its  margins,  would  be  100  kilo-
volts per meter. The Russian generals tell us that the 200 kilovolts
per  meter  is  several  times  the  level  to  which  we  tested.  I  cannot
tell  you  to  which  we  tested.  I  think  that  is  classified,  but  the  Rus-
sian  generals  say  that  that  is  several  times  the  level  to  which  we
tested.  And  at  the  margins,  it  is  probably  a  couple  of  times  to  the
level at which we tested.

My question is what are we doing to prepare for an EMP attack?
The  Commission,  by  the  way,  noted  that  this  is  one  of  a  few  inci-
dents that could, you know, and I am going to put their caution in
the common vernacular, it could end life as we know it. What prep-
arations  are  we  making  for  this  low-probability,  high-impact  prob-
ability?

And I would like to ask Mr. Freese, if a failure of the power sys-
tems  resulted  in  the  loss  of  our  major  transformers,  how  long
would  it  take  to  get  a  new  one,  and  where  would  you  go  to  get  a
new one?

Mr. FREESE. Okay. We have multiple sizes of transformers. Some

of them are readily available in spare parts.

Mr. BARTLETT. But isn’t it true, sir, that the larger ones that we

don’t even make in this country——

Mr. FREESE. Yes, sir. I——
Mr.  BARTLETT.—it  would  take  you  maybe  18  months  to  get

one——

Mr. FREESE. Yes, sir.
Mr. BARTLETT.—ordered from overseas?
Mr. FREESE. I was going to mention that at the——
Mr. BARTLETT. That is correct?
Mr.  FREESE.  There  are  some  major  transformers  that  are  not
made  in  this  country,  made  in  Europe  and  in  Asia,  and  it  would
take  up  to  18  months  to  get  one  sent  over  to  the  United  States.
That  is  one  at  costs  of  several  million  dollars.  And  we,  frankly,
don’t have a lot of those spare parts laying around.

Mr. BARTLETT. But you do have a few spare transformers?
Mr. FREESE. Yes.
Mr. BARTLETT. They are in the field?
Mr. FREESE. Yes.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  They  are  beside  the  transformer  that  if  it  went
out,  you  couldn’t  serve  your  customers.  But  an  EMP  attack  would
take out both of them, would it not?

Mr. FREESE. Yes, sir, it would.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  hope  that  my  colleague,  Dr.  Ehlers,  has  an  op-

portunity to pursue this, because already our yellow light is on.

But  I  want  to  ask  each  of  you  the  level  of  concern  in  your  dis-

cipline about EMP attack and what you are doing.

Let  me  start  with  Mr.  Purdy.  What  is  your  level  of  concern,  sir,

and what are you doing about it?

Mr.  PURDY.  Well,  this  issue  is  concerned  in  the  larger  context  of
the full potential threats to the telecommunications infrastructure.
The Department of Homeland Security is working with the Depart-
ment of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency to ongoing assess
the  developments  of  the  kinds  of  technology  you  are  talking  about
to  consider  the  full  range  of  these  kinds  of  threats  against  various
sectors,  including  the  use  of  EMP  and  telecommunications  electro-
magnetic disruptive effects.

Mr. BARTLETT. Sir, when will you, because our time is very short,
when  will  you  be  able  to  tell  us  of  our  level  of  vulnerability  and
your  recommendations  for  what  we  do  about  it?  Just  tell  us  when
you will be able to tell us that.

Mr. PURDY. Well, we already made recommendations and mitiga-
tive measures have been taken to enhance the equipment providing
greater protection in the event of an EMP threat.

Mr. BARTLETT. My red light is on. Let me just make one observa-

tion and ask if this is not correct.

We  have  SCADA  systems  and  we  have  computers  embedded  in
those, and it is my understanding that we may not even know who
made  those  computers.  And  if  we  know,  they  may  no  longer  be
available,  there  are  so  many  of  those  that  it  would  be  impossible
to harden them, and that unless we are going to replace all of those
SCADA  systems,  we  are  going  to  remain  vulnerable  to  a  pretty
broad scale shutdown of our infrastructure in the event of an EMP
attack. That is correct?

Mr. FREESE. Well, sir, I mentioned it earlier that our electric in-
frastructure  is  made  up  of  a  lot  of  legacy  systems  that  don’t  sup-
port  new  technological  security  protections  and  it  will  take,  prob-
ably,  a  new  generation  of  infrastructure  to  completely  eradicate
those  from  the  system.  Right  now,  we  are  working  with  obsolete
equipment in a lot of cases.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  know  my  red  light  is  on,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  just
want to note that although not one in 100 of our citizens may know
about nuclear EMP attack, I will assure you, sir, that every one of
our potential enemies knows all about it, and it is in their open lit-
erature.

Thank you very much.
Mr. AKIN. [Presiding] Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.
Mr. Miller.
Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The  9/11  Commission  said  that  private  sector  preparedness  for
terrorism attack now must be regarded as part of the cost of doing
business, certainly for critical industries and any kind of critical in-
frastructure.  And  you  can  no  longer—no  industry  that  is  part  of
our  critical  infrastructure  can  ever  claim  again  that  a  nuclear—
that  a,  excuse  me,  terrorist  attack  is  not  foreseeable.  It  must  be
foreseeable. Do all of you agree with that?

Yes, sir.
Mr.  LEGGATE.  I  would  say  the  point  you  come  to  is  the  range  of
scenarios  that  companies  use  to  do  their  testing  of  their  systems
that, in a sense, prior to 9/11, we wouldn’t have conceived——

Mr. MILLER. Right.
Mr.  LEGGATE.—events  of  this  kind.  But  what  we  have  to  do  is

learn from 9/11, learn from the tsunami——

Mr. MILLER. Right.
Mr. LEGGATE.—New Orleans, and also from the bombing in Lon-
don,  for  example,  which  we  have  been  involved  in  managing.  So
each  one  creates  a  new  set  of  situations,  and  then  companies,  and
I  would  make  a  plug  for  this,  really  have  to  really  run  these  sce-
narios  hard  and  find  out,  I  would  call  it  the  disconnected  pieces,
the  things  that  you  wouldn’t  have  predicted  that  show  up.  And  it
also  applies  at  the  national  level  as  well.  So  there  is  enormous
value  in  running  these  scenarios.  Then  to  find  out  the  things  that
do fail well ahead of time.

And number two, prepare your management teams, either at the
country  level  or  the  corporate  level,  to  respond  effectively  during
difficult situations.

Mr. MILLER. Okay. Yes, I agree with you. You can’t just respond
to  the  things  that  have  already  happened.  Be  prepared  for  things
that we know can happen, because they have happened. We really
do  need  smart  people  lying  awake  at  three  o’clock  in  the  morning
trying  to  figure  out  what  could  happen  next  and  how  to  be  pre-
pared for that.

The 9/11 Commission also said that we needed to develop stand-
ards  for  preparedness  in  the  private  sector  that  does  provide  for
business  continuity  and  mitigation,  redundancy,  and  that  those
kind  of  commonly  understood  standards,  they  praised  the  stand-
ards  developed  by  the  American  National  Standards  Institute,
ANSI,  should  become  the  standard  of  care  for  purposes  of  legal  li-
ability.  Is  there  anything  like  that  in  the  cyber  field?  Is  there  any
kind  of  standard  of  care  that  is  the  industry  standard  that  is  well
understood  this  is  what  you  do  to  be  prepared  against  a  cyber  at-
tack?

Yes, sir.

Mr.  FREESE.  Yes,  sir.  In  the  electric  sector,  we  have  the  North
American  Electric  Reliability  Council,  twelve  hundred  cyber  secu-
rity standards. These have been in place for almost two years, and
they  provide  a  very,  very  solid  best  practices  approach  to  securing
critical  security  systems  and  other  critical  systems  against  cyber
attack.  It  extends  into  business  continuity,  disaster  recovery,  per-
sonnel  issues,  background  checks,  network  security,  transmission
security,  and  communications  security.  So  these  are  in  place  right
now.

Mr.  MILLER.  Okay.  And  Mr.  Purdy,  does  the  Homeland  Security
Department embrace the finding of the 9/11 Commission that there
should  be  legal  liability  for  the  failure  to  prepare  up  to  the  stand-
ard of care in industry?

Mr.  PURDY.  We  have  not  taken  a  position  on  whether  there
should be liability in that instance. What we are finding is that the
interpretation  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  statute,  requiring  that  the
CEOs  and  Boards  of  Directors  exercise  due  care  in  their  risk  miti-
gation  processes  has  led  the  CEOs  to  fashion  their  risk  mitigation
strategies  based  on  best  practices.  NIST  provides  very  substantial
guidance  on  best  practices  for  information  systems.  The  FISMA
standards  for  federal  systems  provides  similar  guidance,  and  we
are  working  with  NIST  on  additional  guidance  along  those  areas.
Mr.  MILLER.  Okay.  The  usual  legal  liability  is  for  the  damages
that  would  be  foreseeable  from  a  failure  to  abide  by  the  legal
standard of care. Mr. Freese, for instance, in the energy area in the
electric grid, what would be the foreseeable loss from a cyber terror
attack that was foreseeable, should have been foreseeable, and that
the failure to abide by industry standards had led to it?

Mr. FREESE. Please rephrase the question for me.
Mr.  MILLER.  Okay.  I  will  admit  that  was  a  little  garbled.  I  will

try that again.

What is a foreseeable loss, not just to a power company, but from
all  of  those  who  do  business  with  it  who  depend  upon  it  for  their
power from a cyber security attack?

Mr.  FREESE.  Well,  it  is  going  to  be  very  significant.  From  the
electric  sector,  it  is  one  of  the  primary  critical  infrastructures  in
the  country.  There  is  virtually  nothing  that  doesn’t  use  electricity.
Businesses,  the  military,  everything  uses  electricity.  If  you  have  a
major  cyber  attack  that  takes  out  an  entire  region  of  the  country,
everyone is going to be impacted within that region. I mean, there
is—there  are  some  backup  generators.  There  are  backup  power
supplies, but essentially, a lot of companies are going to take major
losses, financial losses, if there is a major outage that lasts any pe-
riod of time.

Mr. AKIN. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mrs. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  Kepler  and  Mr.  Freese,  you  both  mentioned  your  work  with
the National Laboratories on your critical infrastructure protection
efforts. Could you give us a little more detail about your work with
the Labs? And have they been helpful?

Mr. KEPLER. Yes, I would be happy to do that.
To  link  the  two  discussions  up  here,  from  an  American  Chem-
istry  Council  point  of  view,  we  have  a  concept  called  ‘‘Responsible

Care’’ that we expect our members to subscribe to. In that is a cer-
tain  set  of  management  practices  of  how  you  approach  all  aspects
of  stewardship  in  your  industry,  including  security.  And  in  that  is
embedded  cyber  security.  With  that,  these  are  management  prac-
tices,  and  you  need  to  establish  standards  of  how  you  do  that  in
compliance. You don’t want to subscribe to exact solutions, because
this is such a dynamic area. So we have worked with organizations
that have been outlined, as well as international standards organi-
zations,  and  tried  to  build  those  in.  For  example,  in  plant  vulner-
ability,  assessments  and  design  is  a  great  example.  Just  the  cor-
porate  management  systems  for  how  you  put  in  place  corporate
governance of security, including cyber security as well.

Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Freese.
Mr.  FREESE.  We  have  worked  significantly  with  the  Idaho  Na-
tional Lab and Pacific Northwest National Lab on SCADA, specifi-
cally. We are looking at encryption technologies, encryption of con-
trol  signals  to  prevent  interception  or  injection.  We  are  looking  at
secure  authentication.  And  this  is,  again,  this  is  trying  to  secure
the current systems we have now prior to any long-term R&D com-
ing  into  fruition.  There  is  a  SCADA  testbed  at  the  Idaho  National
Lab that is extremely valuable. It can be used to solve a lot of prob-
lems  with  information  security,  especially  if  it  is  coordinated  with
the—they  also  have  an  energy  infrastructure  set  up  at  Idaho  Na-
tional  Lab  that  has  got  end-to-end—well,  for  an  example  of  infra-
structure for telecommunications and electricity, you can do end-to-
end testing, and you don’t have to bother with piece meal solutions.
You  can  go  and  do  an  entire  range  of  trial  and  error.  And  I  think
those  programs  are  extremely  valuable,  and  they  are  not  made
enough use of right now. And I think we should expand the use of
those,  particularly  in  the  SCADA  testbed.  There  is  a  lot  of  equip-
ment that is used commonly by many, many companies, and those
would  apply  particularly  well  to  that  particular  test  environment.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you.
And  Mr.  Purdy,  you  know,  the  Labs  do  have  expertise  in  both
computers  and  the  networks  and  the  critical  infrastructure  protec-
tions.  To  what  extent  is  your  Division  working  with  the  National
Labs and the U.S. research universities?

Mr. PURDY. One of the highest priority programs for NCSD is our
Control  Systems  Security  Program.  We  funded  it  at  over  $11  mil-
lion  in  2005,  and  the  President’s  budget  proposes  over  $15  million
in  2006.  At  the  heart  of  that  is  our  work  with  the  Idaho  National
Lab and the partnership with the other Labs and partnership with
the  Department  of  Energy  on  their  area  of  responsibility,  and  the
Science and Technology Directorate. So that is a hugely significant
area  that  we  are  working  in  close  partnership,  not  only  with  the
Labs, but the key private sector folks. We helped form, for example,
the Process Control Systems Forum, which is made up of hundreds
of owners and operators. In addition, NIST has an Advisory Group
of  owners  and  operators.  We  are  working  with  DOE  to  build  the
network of the control systems owners and operators so that we get
the  shared  information  on  attacks  and  failures  and  that  we  can
have  a  continuous  loop,  but  it  has  R&D  aspects,  incident  response
aspects,  and  there  are  short-  and  long-term  benefits  to  this  pro-
gram.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you.
And then time for one more question to Mr. Freese again.
One aspect of cyber security is making sure that the Internet and
other  information  networks  are  up  and  running.  And  isn’t  elec-
tricity  critical  to  keeping  the  information  networks,  like  the  Inter-
net, operational? So if so, then cyber security is critical to your core
business of energy production and distribution. But your core busi-
ness  also  is  critical  to  the  cyber  security  of  other  sectors  of  the
economy  and  the  Nation  as  a  whole.  Is  the  energy  sector  giving
equal  attention  to  cyber  security  and  the  protection  of  critical  en-
ergy  infrastructure?  Is  one  more  important  than  the  other  or  are
they the same? It seems like we have got the chicken and the egg,
which is going to be——

Mr.  FREESE.  Yeah,  it  is  kind  of  a  chicken  and  the  egg  situation.
But  I  believe  sincerely  that  the  energy  sector  is  extremely  aware
of  their  responsibilities  to  the  rest  of  the  country  to  provide  com-
munications,  the  Internet,  all  of  those  things.  We  are—we  have
formed major industry groups to look at security within the indus-
try  itself  across  the  sector,  physical  and  cyber  security,  physical
primarily  to  protect  the  cyber  assets.  And  we  take  that  very  seri-
ously.  And  we  understand  that  there  are  these  interdependencies
that  we  are  a  primary  part  of  in  a  lot  of  areas  in  a  lot  of  critical
infrastructure sectors.

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay. Thank you.
My time has expired.
Mr. AKIN. Ms. Johnson.
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  submit  my  entire  statement  to  the
record  and  welcome  this  esteemed  panel.  And  let  me  apologize  for
having to——

Mr.  AKIN.  Without  objection,  that  will  be  entered  in  the  record.
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you.
I apologize for having to dash out and come back.
And  Mr.  Geisse,  welcome.  I  know  two  of  your  colleagues,  John
Mumford, whom I served in the Texas Senate with on the Finance
Committee,  and  Mr.  Whitacre  that  I  have  known  for  20  some
years. So welcome to this committee.

I  have  some  questions  that  I  am  asking  anyone  to  answer.  And
maybe  you  have  already  answered,  and  if  you  have,  just  tell  me,
and I apologize for asking again.

But  what  is  known  about  the  vulnerabilities  of  different  sectors
of the economy that rely on networked information systems, and to
what  extent  can  the  seriousness  of  the  threat  be  quantified  or
prioritized?
Go ahead.
Mr.  PURDY.  The  National  Infrastructure  Advisory  Council,  a
Presidential Advisory Group, made up of private sector individuals,
has done an assessment of the risk and threat to the different crit-
ical  infrastructure  sectors  and  the  dependency  of  those  sectors  on
each  other.  That  is  not  available  for  public  dissemination.  We  are
using  that  as  part  of  our  process  of  identifying  the  cyber  risk  as-
sessment as part of our fusion of the intelligence vulnerability and
consequences  information  and  in  our  work  on  developing  scenarios
that  I  talked  about  in  my  testimony  so  that  we  can  understand

what is necessary to mitigate the possibility of those vulnerabilities
being exploited, how are we going to respond to those, and how are
we  going  to  reconstitute.  And  we  look  forward  to  that  being  a
strong public/private partnership.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you.
Anyone else?
Thank you very much.
Is the government sponsoring enough R&D in an effort to aid the

public sector with cyber security?

Yes.
Mr. PURDY. Let me answer the question this way.
The Federal Government, under HSPD-7, has coordinated, under
the  leadership  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  the
President’s Science Advisor, and the Science and Technology Direc-
torate. They will be issuing a national cyber R&D plan in the very
near  future  which  will  serve  the  benefit  of  scoping  out  what  needs
to  be  done.  They  also  had  an  interagency  group  to  identify  and
track  what  is  happening  and  what  needs  to  be  happening  in  cyber
security. It is my hope that as the articulation of what needs to be
done  and  the  specific  requirements  are  laid  out,  then  those  who
feel that the priorities aren’t the right priorities or feel that the re-
sources aren’t the right ones, then, perhaps, can suggest where the
extra emphasis and resources need to be placed.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Do  I  have  a  little  bit  more  time  for  another  ques-

tion? I guess——

Mr. AKIN. The gentlelady does have a minute and 43 seconds.
Ms. JOHNSON. Okay. Thank you.
There  are  two  aspects  of  cyber  security  that  I  have  concern
about,  because  of  my  constituency  and  because  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity.  One  is  that  I  have  not  met  a  person  who  is  not  suspicious  of
all  of  their  business  being  available  through  the  networks.  And  I
would  like  some  comment  on  that  on  just  how  secure  that  is,  and
two, for terrorist attacks.

So I invite anyone to comment to see what we need to do or what

is the risk or what is real and what is imagined.

Mr.  KEPLER.  On  the  second  part,  I  think  when  you  look  at  the
access  to  terrorism,  this  is  a  critical  issue  in  terms  of  the  amount
of  information  we  want  to  provide  in  this  country  versus  how  that
information  could  be  used  against  us.  And  certainly,  I  mean,  that
is one of the public policy things that needs to be addressed. What
we want to do is be able to have an open environment between the
right  people  to  make  sure  we  can  assess  threat.  The  challenge  is
once you start to look at those vulnerabilities and make them pub-
lic,  they  provide  information  to  our  enemies  as  well.  And  the  chal-
lenge we have is some things that may not be related to terrorism
directly  can  be  used  as  information  to  create  attacks.  And  I  think
we  have  to  spend  a  lot  of  time  on  public  policy  and  on  research  to
figure  out  how  to  segment  those  two  issues  and  keep  them  bal-
anced.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Are  you  doing  any  kind  of  PR  to  allay  the  fears
of  Americans  who  think  that  telephone  companies  and  everybody
else snoop into their business by computer and Internet?

Mr. GEISSE. Telephone companies snooping?

76

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Anything  wired,  people  think  they  can  listen  to
their  conversations,  get  into  their  private  business,  look  at  where
they shop, all of that.

Mr. GEISSE. Well, I think, you know, I will answer your question
in  that  your  concern  about  terrorist  attack,  your  concern  about  in-
formation being available on the Internet are real issues, and they
are  issues  that  industry  has  to  constantly  be  looking  at  to  protect
our customers’ information, which, for example, we do in the phone
company religiously. I mean, we take it very, very serious, our cus-
tomer information and protecting it, and are constantly looking for
ways to prevent attacks on that information.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you.
Would  anybody  else  like  to  comment  or  do  you  think  you  are

saved by the bell?

Mr. AKIN. The gentlelady’s——
Ms. JOHNSON. My time is up.
Mr. AKIN.—time is——
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. AKIN.—expired, and we have a vote on the House Floor, but

if Dr. Ehlers can go quickly, we can get that in, I think.

Mr. EHLERS. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I will try to be pretty rapid.
First of all, to respond to my colleague who just asked the ques-
tion  about  telephone  companies  snooping.  I  grew  up  in  southwest
Minnesota,  a  very  small  town,  hand  crank  telephone  on  the  wall,
a  switchboard  sitting  downtown  with  an  operator,  and  I  can  tell
you,  she  knew  more  about  the  business  of  everyone  in  the  town
than anyone else did. So I suspect there is considerably less snoop-
ing  by  telephone  companies  by  electronics  than  there  was  back
then. But it is certainly a worthwhile question to ask.

I would like to, first of all, just sitting here trying to put this all
in perspective, it seems to me that most of the discussion has been
about cyber security in the sense of software, and that is, of course,
a  major  concern.  It  is  a  concern  both  in  terms  of  industrial  espio-
nage,  as  it  is  called,  certainly  a  concern  in  terms  of  national  secu-
rity. But then there is also the hardware factor, which was brought
up  by  my  colleague  from  Maryland.  And  since  we  are  both  sci-
entists,  maybe  we  have  good  reason  for  both  worrying  about  the
same thing, namely the hardware security.

We  have  known  about  nuclear  EMP  for  a  long  time.  And  I  hap-
pen to be a nuclear physicist and worked at Livermore for one sum-
mer,  years  ago.  And  I  never  worried  that  much  about  it,  because,
frankly,  I  thought  mutually  assured  destruction  was  pretty  clear
policy in that there is no benefit in any country to set off a nuclear
weapon  far  above  another  country  knowing  that  they,  in  turn,
would  have  their  systems  destroyed.  I  do  worry  about  it  much,
much  more  now,  and  I  think  Dr.  Bartlett’s  fear  is  well  founded  in
the  sense  that 
if  you  don’t  have  a  country  that  can  be
counterattacked,  and  if  your  goal  is  to  disable  your  opponent  as
much  as  possible  and  to  cause  grief  and  pain  and  terror,  the  EMP
is  a  very  good  way  to  do  it,  if  you  can  manage  to  get  the  weapon
and the launch vehicle. And I think it is something we have to take
very  seriously.  Mr.  Freese,  I  think  you  were  a  little  optimistic  in
saying  it  would  only  affect  certain  areas  of  the  country,  but  it  de-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:26 Mar 14, 2006 Jkt 023332 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\091505\23332 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

77

pends, again, on the size of the weapon. We are not hardening our
equipment.

And I was struck by a phrase that Mr. Kepler offered earlier that
when  communication  stops,  commerce  stops.  And  I  would  even  ex-
tend  that  beyond  that.  When  commerce  stops,  then  life  is  endan-
gered  and  perhaps  life  stops,  because  with  the  proliferation,  and  I
have been worrying about this for about 10 years now. I never wor-
ried  about  it  too  much  until  the  proliferation  of  the  Internet,  but
today,  so  much  commerce  is  done  over  the  Internet.  But  also,  the
proliferation  of  microprocessors  and  automobiles  and  everywhere
else.  And  an  EMP  would  not  only  affect  communications  but  also
transportation.  How  many  of  us  would  be  able  to  drive  our  car
after  an  EMP  had  wiped  out  the  processors?  And  there  are  some
250, typically, microprocessors in the average American automobile
today.  How  would  trucks  be  able  to  deliver  a  product?  How  would
people  get  food  and  water?  I  mean,  this  is  really  a  doomsday  sce-
nario.

And Mr. Purdy, I hope that you and others are worrying a great
deal  about  this,  because  what  we  really  need  in  place  is  an  infra-
structure  that,  at  least  in  an  emergency  basis,  would  replace  the
infrastructure  that  we  are  becoming  so  dependent  on  through  our
use of microprocessors, Internet, and so forth.

And  I  would  like  to  give  any  of  you  time  to  react  to  my  com-
ments.  Maybe  I  am  off  base,  and  if  so,  I  would  like  to  hear  that.
But if you could, briefly make a comment.

Mr. Kepler.
Mr. KEPLER. Yes, Congressman.
I think one of the key issues as we talk about industry and gov-
ernment  relationship  is  understanding  the  roles  and  responsibil-
ities.  It  is  probably  not  practical  for  companies  to  go  address  that
problem.  That  requires  government  from  that  type  of  level,  and
that  is  my  broader  point  is  these  major  issues  need  to  be  led  by
government in terms of how we address in the sectors need to sup-
port.  There  are  things  the  sectors  need  to  do,  but  there  are  things
the government needs to do in that environment.

Mr.  EHLERS.  If  I  may  just  interject.  It  seems  to  me  your  role,
however, is to try to harden your facilities so that you can continue
to operate.

Mr.  KEPLER.  Absolutely,  and  that  is  why  we  need  diversification
and structure. One point that has been brought up is the idea that
the older technology can’t be replaced, and that is true, but also the
older  technology  is  less  vulnerable  to  the  newer  threats.  So  it  is  a
real delicate balance in terms of putting this new technology in, be-
cause  it  is  actually  more  vulnerable  because  of  its  complexity  and
size. So that is why I think we have got to be really careful of just
putting  technical  solutions  in  and  not  having  the  broad  policy  un-
derstandings and risk balancing here.

Mr.  EHLERS.  That  is  precisely  the  point,  and  the  policy  has  to
come  from  the  Federal  Government,  but  also  the  industry  has  to
be aware of the need to harden their facilities as much as they can
so at least emergency services can continue.

Mr. KEPLER. We agree with that.
Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Purdy, do you have a comment?

Mr. PURDY. I will have to defer to National Communication Sys-

tems on your follow-up question.

Mr. EHLERS. Any other comments?
I  think  everyone  is  eager  to  go  vote,  and  I  am  as  popular  as  a
skunk at the tea party at this point, so I will defer to the Chairman
and yield back.

Mr. AKIN. No, you are very popular, Dr. Ehlers.
And—but your time has expired.
And  now  all  of  our  time  is  expired,  because  we  have  got  to  go

vote.

We  will  leave  the  record  open  for  five  days  for  Members  to  sub-

mit additional written questions for the witnesses.

And  I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  your  time  and  your  testi-
mony.  You  are  experts  in  your  fields,  and  you  have  added  to  our
understanding, and we thank you.

And the Committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Donald ‘‘Andy’’ Purdy, Jr., Acting Director, National Cyber Security Di-

vision, Department of Homeland Security

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Measuring Cyber Security
Q1a. How do you measure national cyber security?
A1a. National cyber security is a rapidly changing area in which a dynamic market
drives  the  continuous  emergence  of  new  technologies  and  an  evolving  threat  envi-
ronment.  As  a  result,  measuring  national  cyber  security  is  an  important  but  chal-
lenging goal.

Organizations, including all levels of industry, government, and academia, do not
necessarily  have  total  network  cognizance,  which  prevents  them  from  being  able  to
measure their own level of security. To create an assessment of national cyber secu-
rity,  an  entity  would  require  accurate  reporting  from  all  organizations  that  rely  on
cyber  systems  on  their  own  individual  networks.  Until  all  organizations  achieve
this, it will be very difficult to measure national cyber security.

NCSD  is  working  toward  achieving  greater  situational  awareness  through  efforts
with: federal agencies, such as federal agency network monitoring; the private sector
through  interaction  with  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Center  (ISACs);  and,
international  partners  through  the  international  Computer  Emergency  Response
Team collaboration. Enhanced situational awareness will help to provide a better es-
timation  of  the  state  of  cyber  security  and  identify  methods  of  measuring  changes
and improvement.

In  addition,  NCSD’s  responsibilities  under  the  National  Infrastructure  Protection
Plan (NIPP) for the IT Sector and cyber guidance across the critical infrastructures,
will  involve  working  with  key  governmental  entities  and  the  private  sector  to  com-
plete  a  sector  specific  plan  that  when  implemented  will  help  to  create  a  national
assessment  of  cyber  risk,  together  with  the  prioritization  of  cyber  risk  mitigation
measures. Several critical infrastructure cyber measures and metrics will be tracked
across  each  sector  based  on  the  Sample  Cyber  Measures  and  Metrics  being  devel-
oped for the NIPP.

The Counter-intelligence community also supports these efforts from the perspec-
tive of cyber espionage threat assessments. Foreign intelligence services are increas-
ingly  using  cyber  espionage  as  a  means  for  collecting  sensitive  information.  We  are
developing  methodologies  for  identifying  their  cyber  capabilities  and  for  assessing,
in more precise form, the damage to national security that might be caused by var-
ious cyber intrusion incidents.
Q1b. How  do  you  determine  if  the  Nation’s  level  of  cyber  vulnerability  is  being  re-

duced?

A1b. In order to determine whether the Nation’s level of cyber vulnerability is being
reduced,  NCSD  undertakes  a  risk  management  approach  that  includes  measuring
threat, vulnerability, and consequences.

There  are  a  number  of  DHS  initiatives  underway  that  examine  cyber-related
vulnerabilities in addition to physical risk and vulnerability assessments. In coordi-
nation  with  the  private  sector,  DHS  is  identifying  cyber  vulnerability  assessment
best practices. This effort began with an evaluation of various methodologies in use
throughout  the  public  and  private  sectors.  In  addition,  NCSD  is  working  closely
with  other  DHS  components  to  ensure  that  cyber  aspects  of  threat,  consequence,
and vulnerability analysis are consistently and appropriately included in risk meth-
odology efforts. These efforts include the Risk Analysis and Management for Critical
Asset  Protection  (RAMCAP),  the  Vulnerability  Identification  Self  Assessment  Tool,
Comprehensive Reviews, and Site Assistance Visits.

NCSD  is  sponsoring  several  exercise  initiatives  that  will  enhance  U.S.  prepared-
ness in the event of a cyber incident and improve communication, coordination, and
procedures between DHS, other government agencies, the public and private sectors,
and with select foreign partners. In February 2006, NCSD will conduct the National
Cyber Exercise: Cyber Storm, which will test federal response to a cyber-related in-
cident  of  national  significance;  examine  state,  federal  and  international  intra-gov-
ernmental  coordination;  and  emphasize  public/private  cooperation  and  communica-
tions  using  the  energy,  information  technology,  telecommunications  and  transpor-
tation  sectors.  In  addition  to  Cyber  Storm,  NCSD  has  also  coordinated  extensively
with and supported the creation of two regional partnerships in the Gulf Coast and
the  Pacific  Northwest  consisting  of  public  and  private  sector  entities.  In  each  of

81

these regions, NCSD has facilitated a tabletop exercise designed to raise awareness
of  infrastructure  interdependencies  and  to  identify  ways  to  improve  regional  pre-
paredness.  Collaboration  with  State/local  government  and  private  sector  companies
has  been  instrumental  in  the  success  of  our  regional  efforts  in  the  Gulf  Coast  and
Pacific  Northwest.  Through  direct  interaction  and  collaboration  during  exercises  in
these regions, NCSD has developed significant partnerships with the public and pri-
vate  sectors  to  better  prepare  for  and  become  more  capable  of  preventing,  respond-
ing to, and recovering from a major cyber incident.

Cyber exercises provide the environment to develop, coordinate, rehearse, and re-
fine  key  processes;  integrate  infrastructure  protection  activities  within  other  na-
tional-level plans; establish mechanisms for coordination and information exchange;
and identify interdependencies, overlaps, and gaps so that all the critical infrastruc-
ture  stakeholders  at  every  level  are  better  prepared  for  and  more  capable  of  pre-
venting,  responding  to,  and  recovering  from  a  major  cyber  incident,  thereby  reduc-
ing exposure to cyber vulnerabilities.
Q1c. How do you decide what is ‘‘secure enough’’?
A1c. Determining  a  sufficient  level  of  security  is  variable  depending  on  the  specific
needs  of  an  organization  and  the  specific  assets  involved,  their  risk  tolerance,  and
the  availability  of  resources.  By  following  established  set  standards  such  as  Inter-
national  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  17799,  an  international  security
standard  that  includes  a  comprehensive  set  of  controls  comprising  best  practices  in
information  security,  as  well  as  conducting  risk  assessments,  entities  may  deter-
mine  their  ideal  security  level.  This  determination  must  be  based  upon  the  results
of  a  risk  assessment  in  which  government  and  the  private  sector  respectively,  can
reasonably  decide  what  level  of  risk  is  acceptable  or  what  areas  need  improvement
and additional effort. Entities will make the determination regarding whether or not
improvements and additional effort are necessary, based on availability of resources
concerning their risk assessments and acceptable levels of risk.
Q1d. Are government mandates needed to increase the Nation’s progress on securing

information systems and to get to ‘‘secure enough’’?

A1d. Government  mandates  would  likely  not  increase  the  Nation’s  progress  on  se-
curing  systems  to  reach  a  state  of  ‘‘secure  enough.’’  This  is  largely  due  to  the  fact
that  a  state  of  ‘‘secure  enough’’  will  differ  for  each  entity  utilizing  information  sys-
tems  and  the  fact  that  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  formulate  a  mandate  that  en-
hances security in a way that can evolve with the dynamic security and technology
environment. Each operating environment is different and each entity, public or pri-
vate, must determine what is needed to continue their individual critical operations
based on their distinct environment. These case-specific needs will evolve over time.
A  comprehensive  awareness  program  to  include  the  promotion  of  a  risk  manage-
ment approach, as well as accepted best practices and standards, is a more effective
tool  for  enhancing  cyber  security  and  achieving  a  greater  state  of  security.  Under
the  NIPP  framework,  metrics  are  being  developed  to  improve  the  measurement  of
cyber security across critical infrastructure sectors.
Q2. Information Sharing
Q2a. What  information  would  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  find  most
helpful  to  receive  from  critical  infrastructure  and  information  technology  com-
panies?  What  do  you,  or  would  you,  do  with  this  information,  and  how  would
you protect sensitive information?

A2a. Industry  information  can  allow  NCSD  (in  partnership  with  other  government
entities  and  the  private  sector)  to  identify  critical  assets  and  interdependencies,
vulnerabilities,  and  problematic  cyber  incidents  and  activity,  assess  cyber  risk  and
prioritize measures to reduce vulnerabilities and cyber risk, generally, and minimize
the  severity  of  cyber  attacks  by  timely  warnings  and  by  increased  awareness  and
outreach  efforts  to  improve  the  cyber  security  of  critical  infrastructures.  DHS  has
established  mechanisms,  such  as  the  Protected  Critical  Infrastructure  Information
program  (PCII),  to  encourage  industry  to  submit  proprietary/sensitive  information
that will be protected and exempt from public disclosure as determined by the PCII
program.  In  addition,  entities  may  securely  submit  information  through  the  United
States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US–CERT) secure website.

Industry  and  government  can  provide  many  forms  of  information  that  are  bene-
ficial  to  NCSD.  First,  identification  of  cyber  points  of  contact  within  organizations
allows 
threats  and
vulnerabilities  to  the  appropriate  parties.  Second,  industry  reporting  of  any  cyber
incidents  (e.g.,  worms,  viruses,  attacks,  etc.)  to  the  US–CERT  provides  NCSD  the

information  on  cyber 

to  disseminate 

the  US–CERT

ability  to  enhance  cyber  situational  awareness  across  all  sectors  as  well  as  to  pro-
vide  alerts  and  warnings  back  to  the  public.  In  addition,  of  particular  importance
from the private sector is information about major impacts that affect critical infra-
structure operations.

Third, the sharing of vulnerability assessment information with NCSD, including
methodologies  used,  consequences  of  loss,  and  interdependencies,  can  assist  NCSD
in the identification of multi-sector cyber vulnerabilities and in collecting best prac-
tices that can be shared across sectors. Information on the cyber vulnerabilities the
private  sector  is  most  concerned  about,  tactics  that  might  be  used  to  exploit  these
vulnerabilities,  or  the  likelihood  from  their  perspective  that  these  vulnerabilities
could  be  exploited,  will  assist  NCSD  in  determining  the  state  of  cyber  security  for
the IT Sector and the Nation. Fourth, it is important for NCSD to receive informa-
tion  on  current  protective  measures,  business  continuity  plans,  and  current  levels
of  resources  applied  to  cyber  security.  Insight  into  this  information  can  enable
NCSD  to  work  even  more  effectively  with  industry  to  address  vulnerabilities  and
further  enhance  protective  measures.  Fifth,  NCSD  is  working  with  critical  infra-
structure  owners  and  operators,  vendors,  and  other  security  partners  to  promote
control  systems  security.  Information  on  control  system  architectures,  protective
measures, metrics, and research and development will further enhance NCSD’s situ-
ational  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  state  of  control  systems  security  and
the  ability  to  provide  protective  measures  that  are  relevant  and  meaningful  to  the
industry.
Q2b. Are  you  currently  receiving  the  information  you  need?  What  are  the  principal
barriers to information sharing? Are changes in legislation or regulations need-
ed to overcome these barriers?

A2b. While  NCSD  does  receive  information  from  various  stakeholders,  we  believe
that  we  can  improve  upon  our  current  level  of  analysis  with  more  information.  We
continue  to  encourage  companies,  government  agencies,  and  others  to  share  infor-
mation as described above.

Perhaps  the  greatest  barrier  to  private  sector  information  sharing  with  the  gov-
ernment  is  concern  about  the  possible  release  of  shared  information  to  the  public,
either  unintentionally  or  by  legal  statute,  such  as  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act
(FOIA).  There  is  a  concern  that  the  release  of  shared  information  by  either  means
could  potentially  lead  to  the  exploitation  of  any  disclosed  vulnerabilities  by  mali-
cious  actors,  cause  damage  to  corporate  reputation,  and/or  result  in  legal  con-
sequences.

DHS,  through  the  PCII  program  office,  is  pursuing  ways  to  make  the  resulting
program as effective as possible in furthering information sharing between the pub-
lic  and  private  sectors  by  providing  industry  protections  and  assurances  through
statutory exemption categories, as afforded by Congress.
Q3. Response to Cyber Attacks
Q3a. If  the  information  systems  of  a  critical  infrastructure  company  were  attacked
today,  is  the  U.S.  prepared  to  detect  the  attack  and  repel  it  or  repair  the  sys-
tems quickly?

A3a. Approximately  eighty-five  percent  of  the  information  infrastructure  is  owned
and operated by the private sector; consequently, the majority of response activities
reside with the private sector. In the case of attack on private sector infrastructure,
NCSD’s  role  includes  providing  support  to  the  private  sector  in  the  form  of  warn-
ings,  incident  response  coordination,  technical  support,  and  coordination  with  law-
enforcement  as  warranted.  In  addition,  NCSD’s  US–CERT  provides  a  national  co-
ordination center that links public and private response capabilities to facilitate in-
formation sharing across all infrastructure sectors and to help protect and maintain
the  continuity  of  our  nation’s  cyber  infrastructure.  US–CERT  serves  as  a  24x7x365
cyber  watch,  warning,  and  incident  response  center,  and  provides  coordinated  re-
sponse to cyber incidents, a web portal for secure communications with private and
public sector stakeholders, a daily report, a public website (http://www.us-cert.gov/),
and  a  National  Cyber  Alert  System,  which  provides  timely,  actionable  information
to  the  public  on  both  technical  and  non-technical  bases.  US–CERT  also  conducts
malicious  code  analysis,  provides  malware  technical  support,  and  conducts  cyber
threat and vulnerability analysis. US–CERT works to advance relationships with in-
frastructure  owners  and  operators  to  confirm  attacks  and  enhance  coordinated  re-
sponse activities.

In  addition,  if  the  attack  rises  to  the  level  of  a  cyber  incident  of  national  signifi-
cance,  the  National  Cyber  Response  Coordination  Group  (NCRCG)  will  help  to  co-
ordinate  the  federal  response,  including  law  enforcement  and  the  intelligence  com-

83

munity,  with  that  of  the  private  sector.  NCSD  co-chairs  the  NCRCG  with  the  De-
partment  of  Justice  and  the  Department  of  Defense.  An  additional  thirteen  federal
agencies  with  a  statutory  responsibility  for  and/or  specific  capability  toward  cyber
security,  including  the  intelligence  community,  are  members.  NCSD  serves  as  the
Executive Agent and point of contact for the NCRCG. As directed by Homeland Se-
curity Presidential Directives 5 and 8, NCSD helped to create a Cyber Annex to the
National  Response  Plan  (NRP)1 that  provides  a  framework  for  responding  to  cyber
incidents  of  national  significance.  The  Cyber  Annex  establishes  the  NCRCG  as  the
principal Federal Government cyber response body.

The  government  is  prepared  to  respond  to  major  cyber  incidents  in  coordination
with  the  private  sector  and  is  working  to  formalize  incident  response  coordination
by ensuring that standard operating procedures work in unison. NCSD is also work-
ing to facilitate, enhance, and ensure public-private coordination during major cyber
incidents.
Q3b. What about if it were an attack on the Internet?
A3b. As  stated  above,  because  approximately  85  percent  of  the  information  infra-
structure is owned and operated by private industry, the majority of mitigation and
restoration  activity  is  borne  by  private  industry.  In  this  regard,  NCSD’s  US–CERT
is enhancing relationships with Internet owners, operators, and other associated in-
dustries to aide in incident coordination and communications with all players to fa-
cilitate rapid response to a significant cyber event or incident. Specifically, the US–
CERT maintains regular communications with the Information Technology Informa-
tion  Sharing  and  Analysis  Center  (ISAC)  and  the  Telecommunications  ISAC.  Addi-
tionally, US–CERT has established relationships with the Financial and Multi-State
ISACs  and  is  well  coordinated  with  the  ISAC  Council  that  includes  ISACs  from
other  critical  infrastructures.  US–CERT  is  prepared  to  reach  out  and  alert  those
within  the  ISAC  communities  and  affected  infrastructure  sectors  when  necessary.
A  large-scale  attack  on  the  infrastructure  of  the  Internet  may  constitute  a  cyber
incident  of  national  significance  that  would  activate  the  NCRCG.  The  NCRCG  is
also  building  a  more  robust  partnership  with  the  IT  sector,  with  Internet  Service
Providers,  and  through  NCSD’s  responsibilities  for  the  cyber  component  of  the  Na-
tional  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan  (NIPP)  to  enable  a  collaborative,  coordinated
approach to attack mitigation and recovery.

The NCSD also co-chairs the Internet Disruption Working Group (IDWG) with the
National Communications Systems (NCS). The IDWG was established by the NCSD
and  NCS  to  form  a  strategic  partnership  with  other  key  government  agencies.  Its
focus is to identify and detail actions that can be taken in the near-term to enhance
Internet  resilience.  An  initial  goal  of  the  IDWG  was  to  reach  out  to  private  sector
stakeholders.  A  one-day  IDWG  Forum  was  conducted  on  November  29,  2005  as  an
initial  undertaking  to  bring  subject  matter  experts  together  around  a  common  con-
cern:  Internet  disruption  and  hardening  with  a  focus  on  gathering  feedback  on  the
most  likely  risk  scenarios  facing  the  Internet  infrastructure  today.  Emphasis  was
placed on discussing immediate near-term needs and requirements for industry-gov-
ernment coordination in preparation for or during an Internet disruption of national
significance.  The  IDWG  will  analyze  outcome  data  from  the  forum  to  develop  near-
term  action  plans  for  risk  preparedness,  vulnerability  mitigation,  and  response  and
reconstitution. Information will be provided to the NCS, NCRCG and the US–CERT
for consideration as input to the update of the NRP/ESF–2 which is the overarching
National  plan  for  communications  recovery/reconstitution  activities.  Near-term  ac-
tion plans are scheduled to be completed by the end of the 2nd quarter, FY06.
Q3c. What  role  can  and  should  DHS  and  other  public  and  private  organizations

play in these response activities?

A3c. Although  the  private  sector  owns  and  operates  such  a  large  part  of  the  infor-
mation  infrastructure,  and  that  infrastructure  represents  a  critical  national  asset,
response  activities  reside  with  both  the  private  sector  and  the  government.  DHS’s
role is to ensure the coordination and effectiveness of government preparedness and
response efforts in partnership with the private sector.

US–CERT  is  the  operational  arm  for  DHS’s  coordinated  cyber  preparedness  and
response  and  collaborates  with  affected  parties  to  assist  with  rapid  response.  US–
CERT  also  builds  situational  awareness,  provides  malicious  code  and  vulnerability
analysis,  disseminates  timely  alerts  and  warnings,  participates  in  exercises,  devel-
ops and refines standard operating procedures, and provides training.

As discussed above, the Cyber Annex to the National Response Plan (NRP), which
provides  a  framework  for  responding  to  cyber  incidents  of  national  significance,  es-
tablishes  the  NCRCG  as  the  principal  Federal  Government  response  body.  The
NCRCG  will  engage  the  applicable  private  sector  entities  to  ensure  both  the  feasi-
bility and comprehensiveness of the mitigation and recovery strategy.
Q3d. What  are  the  barriers  to  DHS,  companies,  or  other  organizations  providing  a

quick, effective, and coordinated response?

A3d. NCSD  views  the  current  challenges  to  include  clearly  defined  roles  and  re-
sponsibilities  for  response  activities.  Delineating  roles  and  responsibilities  between
the  public  and  private  sectors  with  regard  to  response  is  well  underway.  The  US–
CERT  Concept  of  Operations  (CONOPS)  provides  federal  agency  reporting  and  co-
ordination, while the NCRCG CONOPS provides response to a cyber incident of na-
tional  significance.  US–CERT  and  NCRCG  continue  to  refine  draft  Standard  Oper-
ating  Procedures  (SOPS)  to  ensure  systemization  and  coordination  of  response  ac-
tions.  Also,  as  stated  above,  NCSD  is  working  to  facilitate,  enhance,  and  ensure
public-private coordination during major cyber incidents.

NCSD’s  Cyber  Storm  exercise  seeks  to  test  whether  in  the  event  of  an  incident,
the  public  and  private  sectors  are  prepared  to  act  in  a  coordinated  fashion.  By  ex-
amining  homeland  security  cyber  response  and  recovery  mechanisms,  NCSD  can
evaluate  the  existing  resources  and  procedures  to  recommend  improvements  to  in-
formation  sharing,  processes,  and  policies  for  a  more  coordinated  and  robust  na-
tional cyber incident preparedness and response. Specifically, Cyber Storm will pro-
vide  the  opportunity  for  the  lead  agencies  in  the  Federal  Government  to  examine
their SOPS and CONOPS in a controlled environment and make revisions based on
the outcome of the exercise.
Q4. Cyber Security R&D
Q4a. What are the biggest technology gaps, or areas where research and development
(R&D)  are  most  needed,  that  you  see  in  trying  to  protect  information  systems
across critical infrastructure sectors?

A4a. For cyber security research and development (R&D) within the Department of
Homeland Security, the Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate coordinates with
the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD). NCSD collects, develops, and submits
cyber  security  R&D  requirements  to  provide  input  for  the  S&T  Directorate’s  cyber
security  research  priorities  and  to  the  federal  cyber  security  R&D  community.  The
most  significant  technology  gaps  where  R&D  is  needed  to  protect  information  sys-
tems  across  critical  infrastructure  sectors  fall  into  three  categories:  (1)  technologies
that  are  applicable  to  standard  network-based  information  systems,  [the  Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate is ad-
dressing some of these through existing and planned programs within the Cyber Se-
curity  portfolio];  (2)  technologies  that  are  applicable  to  distributed  control  systems
[the  S&T  Directorate  is  addressing  these  issues  through  existing  programs  within
the Critical Infrastructure portfolio—see Q02935]; and (3) technologies that are rel-
evant  when  enterprise  information  systems  are  directly  connected  to  distributed
control systems.

Technologies needing further R&D related to distributed control systems are:

— Efficient, intelligent, cross-domain intrusion detection systems
— Effective authentication and authorization technologies
— Methods  for  testing  and  verification  of  solutions  to  retrofit  existing  systems
— Automated security assessments
— Efficient, low-cost encryption technologies
— Improved  technologies  for  non-intrusive  testing  methods  for  secondary  (su-

pervisory) instrumentation systems.

Improved  technologies  needing  further  R&D  related  to  enterprise  systems  con-
nected  to  distributed  control  systems,  but  are  not  currently  commercially  available
are:

— System-wide intrusion detection and prevention systems
— Intelligent firewalls
— Multi-level security systems
— High-level auditing and reporting systems

veloping an agenda for the R&D listed above. The Plan responds to significant driv-
ers for improved federal cyber security and information assurance R&D arising from
current federal priorities, as outlined in the 2005 report of the President’s Informa-
tion  Technology  Advisory  Committee  (PITAC)  and,  additionally,  the  following  docu-
ments:  the  OSTP/OMB  Memorandum  on  Interagency  R&D  Priorities  for  FY  2007;
Cyber  Security:  A  Crisis  of  Prioritization,  the  2003  National  Strategy  to  Secure
Cyberspace; and the 2002 Cyber Security Research and Development Act (Public Law
107–305).  The  purpose  of  the  Plan  is  to  provide  baseline  information  and  an  initial
technical  framework  for  a  coordinated  multi-agency  R&D  effort  in  cyber  security
and  information  assurance.  The  Plan  was  developed  by  the  Cyber  Security  and  In-
formation  Assurance  Interagency  Working  Group  (CSIA  IWG)  of  the  National
Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The CSIA R&D Plan has been coordinated,
and  is  consistent  with  the  National  Critical  Infrastructure  Protection  Research  and
Development Plan, developed by OSTP and the S&T Directorate.

The  CSIA  IWG  was  established  by  the  Subcommittee  on  Infrastructure  and  the
Subcommittee  on  Networking  and  Information  Technology  Research  and  Develop-
ment (NITRD). The purpose of the IWG is to coordinate policy, programs, and budg-
ets  for  cyber  security  and  information  assurance  (CSIA)  R&D.  This  includes  identi-
fying  and  integrating  requirements,  conducting  joint  program  planning,  and  devel-
oping  joint  strategies  for  the  CSIA  R&D  programs  conducted  by  agency  members
of  the  Subcommittees.  For  the  purposes  of  this  document,  CSIA  includes  funda-
mental and applied R&D, technology development and engineering, demonstrations,
testing and evaluation, and education and training; and ‘‘agencies’’ refers to federal
departments, agencies, directorates, institutes, and other organizational entities.

The following federal agencies are represented on the IWG:

• Department of Commerce:

— National Institute of Standards and Technology

• Department of Defense:

— Office  of  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Science  &  Tech-

nology

— Defense Information Systems Agency
— Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
— Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy
— National Security Agency
— Technical Support Working Group (joint with Department of State)

• Department of Energy
• Department of Health and Human Services:

— National Institutes of Health
• Department of Homeland Security:

— National Communications System
— National Cyber Security Division
— Science and Technology Directorate

• Department of Justice
• Department of State
• Department of Transportation:

— Federal Aviation Administration

• Department of the Treasury
• Central Intelligence Agency
• Environmental Protection Agency
• National Aeronautics and Space Administration
• National Science Foundation

Q4b. What  federal  R&D  programs  exist  in  these  areas  and  what  are  their  funding

levels?

A4b. We  refer  you  to  the  Federal  Plan  for  Cyber  Security  and  Information  Assur-
ance  Research  and  Development  (CSIA  R&D  Plan)  for  a  consolidated  list  of  R&D
programs in the areas listed above, broken out by federal agency. The Plan also in-
cludes detailed funding information for each of the programs.

The  federal  agency  funding  information  gathered  during  the  CSIA  Plan  process
was pre-decisional and of varying granularity; it was collected only to provide a pre-

liminary indication of federal agency spending emphases in cyber security and infor-
mation assurance. Thus, the baseline findings derived from this information should
be  viewed  as  useful  in  the  aggregate,  but  not  a  comprehensive  source  of  detailed
investment data.

DHS’s  S&T  Directorate  and  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP)
prepare an annual Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) R&D Plan, as mandated
by  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  (HSPD)–7.  The  first  of  these  plans  is
available  to  the  public.  It  specifically  addresses  and  combines  ongoing  R&D  activi-
ties and future goals for both cyber and physical domains. This plan has been thor-
oughly coordinated across multiple federal agencies and includes input from the pri-
vate  sector,  academia,  and  the  national  laboratories  through  a  series  of  facilitated
technical  workshops.  The  plan  was  developed  under  the  auspices  of  the  Infrastruc-
ture  Subcommittee  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC),  over-
seen  by  OSTP.  The  subcommittee  further  acts  as  an  integrating  mechanism  for
input  and  planning  efforts  conducted  by  two  interagency  working  groups,  one  fo-
cused on physical security and one focused on cyber security, that report to the Sub-
committee.

Within the DHS S&T Directorate, the CIP and Cyber Security portfolios have sev-

eral programs linking cyber security research to critical infrastructure protection:

• Process Control System Forum (PCSF)—This forum was established this year
to  accelerate  the  development  of  technology  that  will  enhance  the  security,
safety, and reliability of process control system (PCS) and supervisory control
and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  systems.  The  Forum  provides  a  united  venue
for  industry  and  government  (including  DHS’s  S&T  Directorate,  DHS’s  Na-
tional Cyber Security Division, and other partners) to work together in evalu-
ating, specifying, developing, refining, and testing new technologies. The S&T
Directorate has expended $1.5M in FY 2004, and obligated another $1.5M in
FY 2005. In FY 2006, it is anticipated that an additional $750K will be used
to fund PCSF.

• Control  System  Security  Test  Center  (CSSTC)—In  collaboration  with  the  De-
partment  of  Energy  (DOE)  and  its  resources  and  testing  facilities,  this  pro-
gram  focuses  on  developing  procedures  for  enumerating  the  vulnerability  of
process  control  systems  to  cyber  attack  and  finding  solutions  to  correct  these
weaknesses.  This  is  intended  to  be  a  close  private/public  partnership  effort
with  the  critical  infrastructure  industries  that  use  and  manufacture  process
control  systems.  The  CSSTC  is  run  out  of  the  National  Cyber  Security  Divi-
sion; funding does not come from the Science and Technology Directorate.

• Linking  the  Oil  &  Gas  Industry  to  Improve  Cyber-Security  (LOGIC)—This
public-private partnership is aimed at reducing vulnerabilities in process con-
trol environments used in the oil and gas sector by establishing a framework
for  assessing  risks,  evaluating  new  technologies,  and  providing  an  environ-
ment  for  collaborative  cyber-security  projects.  Currently  in  planning  stages,
this  effort  brings  together  government  and  private  sector  stakeholders  to
identify a working model for leveraging the collective resources of the oil and
gas sector, government agencies, and national laboratories to improve process
control  system  security.  In  FY  2006,  the  S&T  Directorate  intends  to  fund
LOGIC and $500K.

• Small  Business  Innovative  Research  (SBIR)  Awards—In  FY  2004,  13  Phase
I  SBIR  projects  were  awarded  in  the  area  of  process  control  system  security.
In  FY  2005,  Phase  II  SBIRs  were  awarded  to  a  subset  of  the  Phase  I  per-
formers, on the following topics:

— Advanced Security for SCADA Systems;
— Protection  of  SCADA  Systems  Using  Physics  Based  Authentication  and

Location Awareness;

— Improved Security Information Management for SCADA Systems;
— A Robust Secure Management System for SCADA/EMS Operations; and
— A  Toolkit  for  Next  Generation  Electric  Power  SCADA  Security  Protec-

tion and Research.

In  SBIRs  for  SCADA/Process  Control  Security,  the  S&T  Directorate  has  com-

mitted/obligated approximately $3.75M for the Phase II efforts.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Earlier  this  year,  GAO  reported  to  Congress  (GAO–05–827T)  that  the  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  ‘‘has  not  yet  developed  national  cyber  threat  and
vulnerability assessments or government/industry contingency recovery plans for
cyber security, including a plan for recovering key Internet functions.’’

Q1a. What is the current status of progress toward developing national cyber threat
and vulnerability assessments, and by what date or dates do you estimate such
assessments will be completed?

A1a. As part of NCSD’s participation in the development of the National Infrastruc-
ture  Protection  Plan  (NIPP),  the  NIPP  Base  Plan  discusses  cyber  security  and  the
cross-sector  cyber  element  of  critical  infrastructure  and  key  resources  protection
across all 17 critical infrastructure sectors. It also highlights cyber security concerns
in an appendix that provides additional details on processes, procedures, and mech-
anisms  needed  to  achieve  NIPP  goals  and  the  supporting  objectives  for  cyber  secu-
rity.  The  cyber  security  appendix  specifies  cyber  responsibilities  for  security  part-
ners,  processes  and  initiatives  to  reduce  cyber  risk,  and  milestones  and  metrics  to
measure progress on enhancing the Nation’s protection of cyber infrastructure.

The draft NIPP Base Plan was released for final review and comment on Novem-
ber  2,  2005  and  addresses  the  federal,  State,  territorial,  tribal,  local,  and  private
sector roles and responsibilities for critical infrastructure protection. It will be com-
pleted in early 2006. The 17 critical infrastructure and key resource (CI/KR) Sector-
Specific Plans (SSPs) will further detail risk reduction strategies related to their re-
spective  critical  cyber  infrastructure.  The  SSPs  will  be  completed  in  180  days  after
the publication of the NIPP Base Plan.

In addition to physical risk and vulnerability assessments, there are a number of
DHS  initiatives  underway  that  examine  cyber-related  vulnerabilities.  DHS,  in  co-
ordination with the private sector, is identifying cyber vulnerability assessment best
practices. This effort began with an evaluation of various methodologies from across
public  and  private  sectors.  NCSD  is  also  working  closely  with  other  DHS  compo-
nents to ensure that cyber aspects of threat, consequence, and vulnerability analysis
are  consistently  and  appropriately  included  in  risk  methodology  efforts.  These  ef-
forts  include  the  Risk  Analysis  and  Management  for  Critical  Asset  Protection
(RAMCAP),  the  Vulnerability  Identification  Self  Assessment  Tool,  Comprehensive
Reviews, and Site Assistance Visits. To achieve this objective, NCSD will:

1) Support the development of cyber components of RAMCAP.
2) Complete its evaluation of public and private sector vulnerability assessment
methodologies  and  document  best  practices  in  Q1FY06  for  integration  into
other efforts;

3) Integrate  cyber  issues  and  best  practices  into  DHS  risk  management  and
vulnerability  assessment  methods  and  tools  through  ongoing  and  continued
collaboration  and  coordination  with  DHS  entities  as  methods  and  tools  are
implemented; and

4) enhance  understanding  of  the  impact  of  cyber  attacks  by  analyzing  the  con-
sequences (i.e., economic, human, physical) of cyber attacks on critical infra-
structure sectors by Q3FY06.

In  addition,  NCSD’s  US–CERT  Control  Systems  Security  Program  and  the  US–
CERT  Control  Systems  Security  Center  (CSSC)  work  to  reduce  control  system
vulnerabilities in our critical infrastructure. The Control Systems Security Program
coordinates  efforts  among  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments,  as  well  as  control
system  owners,  operators,  and  vendors  to  improve  control  system  security  within
and  across  all  critical 
infrastructure  sectors  by  reducing  cyber  security
vulnerabilities  and  risk.  The  US–CERT  CSSC  coordinates  control  system  incident
management,  provides  timely  situational  awareness  information,  and  manages  con-
trol  system  vulnerability  and  threat  reduction  activities.  The  US–CERT  CSSC
brings  together  government,  industry,  and  academia  to  reduce  vulnerabilities,  re-
spond to threats, and foster public/private collaboration. NCSD and the Control Sys-
tems Security Program are also working with other DHS components to ensure that
control  systems  security  is  integrated  into  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  meth-
odologies and tools designed for use across multiple sectors.

Further,  to  reduce  control  system  vulnerabilities  in  our  critical  infrastructure,
CSSC  developed  a  draft  cyber  security  protection  framework  for  identifying  control
systems security protection measures and comparing them against existing security
standards.  The  framework  provides  a  systematic  methodology  for  assessing  the
cyber  security  posture  of  control  systems.  It  is  designed  to  reduce  the  burden  on

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:26 Mar 14, 2006 Jkt 023332 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\091505\23332 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

88

owners and operators by providing them with a means to select protective measures
that apply to their specific architecture and operating environment and reduce their
respective risk.

As part of this framework, the CSSC also has capabilities at Idaho National Lab-
oratory to perform vulnerability assessments of control systems. The CSSC is work-
ing  with  commercial  vendors  and  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  complete  assess-
ments of three different control systems to identify cyber vulnerabilities, reverse en-
gineer  exploits,  and  provide  solutions  to  secure  vendor  systems.  A  code-based  anal-
ysis  has  also  been  conducted  in  cooperation  with  a  vendor/manufacturer  to  identify
possible vulnerabilities and recommendations to secure the system.

The cyber security protection framework also leverages best practices from indus-
try  for  securing  control  systems  against  cyber  attacks  and  organizes  them  so  the
control  systems  community  can  identify  specific  solutions  to  their  security
vulnerabilities.  As  part  of  the  framework,  implementation  tools,  such  as  a  ‘‘self-as-
sessment tool,’’ have also been developed to allow owners and operators of industrial
control  systems  to  perform  on-site  self-assessments  against  a  database  of  cat-
egorized security requirements.

In  addition,  NCSD’s  Law  Enforcement/Intelligence  Branch  has  multiple  efforts
underway  in  this  area.  For  example,  the  Law  Enforcement/Intelligence  Branch,  in
collaboration  with  the  Homeland  Infrastructure  Threat  and  Risk  Assessment  Cen-
ter,  (HITRAC),  has  created  a  draft  Domestic  Cyber  Risk  Estimate  to  evaluate  the
threats emanating from inside the U.S., to complement international threat assess-
ments  completed  by  the  intelligence  community.  HITRAC  is  comprised  of  subject
matter  experts  from  the  Office  of  Infrastructure  Protection  and  the  Office  of  Intel-
ligence and Analysis.
Q1b. What is the current status of progress toward developing government/industry
contingency  recovery  plans  for  cyber  security,  including  a  plan  for  recovering
key Internet functions, and by what date or dates do you estimate such recovery
plans will be completed?

A1b. DHS  is  confronting  this  security  challenge  through  the  work  of  the  Internet
Disruption  Working  Group  (IDWG),  a  partnership  between  the  NCSD  and  the  Na-
tional  Communications  System  (NCS).  To  initiate  the  substantive  work  of  IDWG,
the NCSD conducted a one-day IDWG Forum with major public sector partners and
subject matter experts in late November 2005. Participants at the Forum will work
to  continue  to  collaboratively  work  in  identifying  actions  that  can  be  taken  in  the
near-term to better protect against, respond to, and reconstitute following an Inter-
net  disruption.  Topics  discussed  included:  risk  scenarios;  path  forward/near-term
protective  measures;  key  Internet  infrastructure  components;  path  forward/near-
term response; scope of disruption analysis (or ‘‘thresholds’’); and path forward/near-
term response.

The  IDWG  will  analyze  outcome  data  to  develop  near-term  action  plans  for  risk
preparedness, situational awareness, vulnerability mitigation, and response and re-
constitution.  Information  will  be  provided  to  the  NCS,  NCRCG,  and  the  US–CERT
for consideration as input to the update of the National Response Plan (NRP)/Emer-
gency  Support  Function  (ESF)  #2,  which  is  the  overarching  National  plan  for  com-
munications recovery/reconstitution activities. Near-term action plans are scheduled
to be completed by the end of the 2nd quarter, FY06. Action plans will be composed
detailing  near-term  steps  for  industry  and  government  to  increase  Internet  resil-
iency.

In  addition,  the  Emergency  Support  Function  #2,  Communications,  is  one  of  fif-
teen  emergency  support  functions  (ESF)  maintained  by  the  Federal  Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) as part of the Federal Response Plan (FRP). The Na-
tional  Communications  System  (NCS)  is  responsible  for  ESF  #2,  which  ensures  the
federal  telecommunications  support  to  federal,  State  and  local  response  efforts  fol-
lowing  a  Presidentially  declared  major  disaster,  emergency  or  extraordinary  situa-
tion  under  the  FRP.  Because  the  Internet  backbone  is  telecom-based,  NCS’s  exper-
tise will help to promote the survivability of the Internet and recovery after disrup-
tion. NCSD and NCS have agreed to explore the need for possible recommendations
to  revise  ESF–2  to  ensure  that  cyber  is  appropriately  accounted  for  (with  SOPs  as
appropriate).
Q2. The  Critical  Infrastructure  Information  (CII)  program,  which  is  authorized  by
the statute creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is intended to
protect  cyber  security  related  information  provided  voluntarily  to  DHS  by  the
private sector. In response to a question at the hearing, you indicated that DHS
has interim rules in place for instituting the CII program.

89

Q2a. What  is  the  current  status  of  the  CII  program  and  by  what  date  do  you  esti-

mate that the final rule for its implementation will be in place?

A2a. The Department has synthesized the comments received and has reviewed the
operating  experience  with  the  program  to  date.  The  item  has  a  very  high  priority;
however,  DHS  is  committed  to  making  sure  that  the  rule  and  the  Program  work
effectively  for  the  Department  and  critical  infrastructure  owners/operators,  and
thus, the draft document has been undergoing further refinement. In the meantime,
based on its operating experience, the PCII Program Office has already been imple-
menting changes in its operating procedures to respond to some of the issues raised
in the comments to make PCII more flexible/useful for submitters. The editing proc-
ess  is  nearing  completion.  Before  going  to  the  Federal  Register,  the  Rule  must  be
submitted  to  OMB  for  interagency  coordination.  The  Department  is  committed  to
working  to  resolve  any  issues  that  may  arise  there  as  quickly  as  possible.  The  rule
will  be  published  as  a  Final  Rule  and  DHS  will  continue  to  work  with  submitters
and government users to address implementation issues as they arise.

In  addition  to  these  efforts  toward  a  Final  Rule,  approximately  a  year  ago,  DHS’
PCII Office implemented a way for companies to sign up to submit protected critical
infrastructure  information  to  NCSD  on  a  recurring  basis  through  the  secure  US–
CERT  Portal.  Since  then,  NCSD  has  been  working  toward  a  mechanism  to  enable
companies to submit protected information on an episodic basis, rather than having
to  pre-enroll.  This  mechanism  is  scheduled  to  be  implemented  in  early  2006.  Addi-
tionally, the Department has been working to establish a pilot with the NCSD/US–
CERT  submissions  to  allow  the  submitter  to  request  limited  dissemination  of  their
information. This effort is expected to be active in early 2006 as well.
Q2b. What are the principal concerns of the private sector thus far regarding imple-
mentation  of  the  CII  program,  and  how  is  DHS  responding  to  these  concerns?
A2b. One  of  the  main  concerns  frequently  expressed  by  the  private  sector  with  re-
spect to the PCII Program is dissemination of information shared by the private sec-
tor.  Several  organizations  have  stated  that  they  would  contemplate  sharing  cyber
related  information  with  NCSD  if  dissemination  of  their  information  were  limited
to only NCSD. As a result, NCSD has begun working with the PCII Program Office
in ‘piloting’ the capability for an entity to submit CII information directly to NCSD
and  request  that  information  be  limited  in  its  dissemination  to  only  NCSD.  We  ex-
pect this pilot effort, consistent with the interim final rule, to be operational shortly.
Q3. In  his  testimony,  Mr.  Freese  indicated  that  the  Process  Control  Security  Forum
is  doing  good  work  in  developing  design  guidelines  for  the  next  generation  of
more  secure  control  systems,  and  he  suggested  the  need  for  support  from  DHS
for  seed  money  to  support  the  implementation  of  ideas  and  concepts  developed
by the Forum.
What is your view of the value of the Process Control Security Forum, and what
is your response to Mr. Freese’s suggestion?

A3. The  Process  Control  Systems  Forum  (PCSF)  is  an  industry  lead  group  com-
prised  of  many  interest  and  working  groups  with  the  focus  of  securing  legacy  and
next  generation  control  systems.  The  PCSF  is  sponsored  by  the  Department  of
Homeland  Security’s  Science  &  Technology  (S&T)  Directorate.  The  NCSD  co-chairs
the PCSF and supports the PCSF in their mission to accelerate the design, develop-
ment,  and  deployment  of  more  secure  control  and  legacy  systems  currently  embed-
ded  with  our  nation’s  critical  infrastructure.  The  NCSD  Control  Systems  Security
Program’s  (CSSP)  goal  is  to  reduce  the  risk  from  a  cyber  attack  to  control  systems
associated  with  our  nation’s  critical  infrastructure.  The  NCSD  CSSP  provides  rec-
ommendations for areas of research and development (R&D) to the S&T Directorate
as gaps and vulnerabilities are identified in control system cyber security.

NCSD’s  CSSP  is  an  active  participant  within  the  PCSF.  The  CSSP  leads  several
interest groups within the PCSF in order to inform and receive comments on CSSP
initiatives,  such  as  the  Control  Systems  Security  Framework  and  Self-Assessment
tool  and  control  systems  security  focused  standards.  The  value  of  the  PSCF  is  its
ability  to  reach  out  to  representatives  of  the  critical  infrastructure  sectors,  such  as
chemical, water, energy, and telecommunications, which utilize Process Control Sys-
tems (PCS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). The NCSD ac-
tively engages with the PSCF to reach vendors and asset owners as part of its out-
reach efforts. More recently, for example, the NCSD CSSP published the Hurricane
Katrina  Control  Systems  Assistance  Informational  Paper,  which  provided  guidance
for rebuilding and securely restarting control systems. The paper is available on the
PCSF website, as well as the NCSD US–CERT website.

Question submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. I  understand  that  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  created  the  new  position
of Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security and Telecommunications. Why has this
position not yet been filled, and when will it be filled?

A1. As with other key leadership positions, the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Secu-
rity and Telecommunications position requires a unique skill set of managerial and
substantive  expertise  and  we  are  in  the  process  of  reviewing  the  qualifications  of
several  candidates.  The  Department  will  move  forward  with  the  process  of  identi-
fying a suitable nominee as quickly as possible.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  John  S.  Leggate,  Chief  Information  Officer  and  Group  Vice  President,

Digital & Communications Technology, BP Plc., United Kingdom

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Measuring Cyber Security
Q1a. How do you measure your company’s cyber security?
A1a. We  assess  our  capability  to  manage  security  vs.  the  risk,  assessed  through  a
combination of assessment of threats against the company, the potential weaknesses
in systems and processes and the impact that such exposures could have.
Q1b. How  do  determine  if  your  company’s  level  of  cyber  vulnerability  is  being  re-

duced?

A1b. The assessment approach stated above measures risk reduction activities such
as device patching and the relevance of such actions.
Q1c. How do you decide what is ‘‘secure enough’’?
A1c. The impact assessment, measuring financial and non-financial impact (such as
safety,  environment,  effect  on  society,  regulatory  compliance  and  reputation)  deter-
mines  whether  something  matters  to  the  company.  The  likelihood  of  the  event,  as-
sessed by threat intelligence and effectiveness of controls determines how much ac-
tion needs to be taken.
Q1d. Are there specific metrics you use in evaluating the cyber security of your com-

pany?

A1d. We  use  specific  metrics  relating  to  the  effectiveness  of  particular  controls  or
the trend of threats. We have a scale used for assessing impact for the most signifi-
cant  risks.  (Broader  concepts  such  as  value  at  risk  have  as  yet  proved  illusory  in
the case of operational risks).
Q1e. How should the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determine if the Na-

tion is making progress?

A1e. Firstly,  through  risk  assessment  of  security—what  is  at  risk  and  how  well  is
it  protected,  the  capabilities  deployed,  measured  in  the  form  of  skilled  people,  de-
ployed security technologies and processes. Secondly through the number of security
events being reported.
Q1f. Are  government  mandates  needed  to  increase  the  progress  and  get  to  ‘‘secure

enough’’?

A1f. The  government  should  always  avoid  mandating  specifics,  as  true  knowledge
of the most appropriate control always exists within the sector (no matter which sec-
tor).  However,  government  should  mandate  processes  and  actions  that  ensure  that
cross-sector risks are identified and picked up and that sectors measure themselves
against their own standards.
Business Case for Cyber Security
Q1g. Within  your  company,  how  do  you  make  the  business  case  for  the  costs  associ-
ated  with  more  secure  information  technology  products?  What  can  the  Federal
Government do to help you make this case and make investment in cyber secu-
rity more attractive?

A1g. The  security  requirements  for  information  technology  products  are  generally
little  more  than  the  basics  of  good  integrity,  i.e.,  no  vulnerabilities.  The  addition  of
simple  security  measures  like  frrewalls  and  anti-virus  and  next  generation  protec-
tion of data is just good business. No special action is required outside normal good
business practice. The government need take no additional action.
Q2. Information Sharing
Q2a. What  information  would  you  find  most  helpful  to  receive  from  the  government
(especially  DHS)  or  from  other  companies  when  you  are  making  decisions  re-
lated to what cyber security you need. When responding to an attack or an inci-
dent?

A2a. Threat  information  about  new  risks  and  problems  being  encountered  in  near
real-time.

92

Q2b. What information have you been asked for by DHS that you feel uncomfortable

providing and why?

A2b. Detail of security events and known vulnerabilities. We have no assurances as
to  the  protection  of  our  information,  who  has  access  to  it  and  how  it  will  be  used.
Additionally  we  are  concerned  that  there  will  be  demands  put  on  the  individuals
dealing with the incident that are no in the best interest of our company.
Q2c. What are the principal barriers to information sharing: Are changes in the leg-

islation or regulations needed to overcome these barriers?

A2c. Simple trust between one person and another. It takes time to build and needs
processes to bed in before it works. Changes in process such as a move from ISACs
to central DHS actions was a backward step in this fragile trust model. Government
funding to help the information sharing infrastructure is invaluable in getting over
the  lead  time  between  starting  and  seeing  value  (which  is  a  barrier  for  company
funding).
Q3. Responding to Cyber attacks
Q3a. If  the  information  systems  of  a  critical  infrastructure  company  were  attacked
today,  is  the  U.S.  prepared  to  detect  the  attack  and  repel  it  or  repair  the  sys-
tems quickly?

A3a. It  depends  on  the  industry,  the  nature  of  the  attack  and  the  company  itself.
Response  would  range  from  excellent  to  poor.  As  a  whole  the  U.S.  Government
would  probably  not  be  of  much  help  in  helping  critical  infrastructure  companies;
however,  the  company  themselves  may  be  prepared  to  handle  the  majority  of  at-
tacks.
Q3b. What about if it were an attack on the Internet?
A3b. There  is  no  coordinated  response  to  an  Internet  attack.  Recovery  would  be  by
adhoc  action  and  if  unlucky  could  be  catastrophic  if  the  impact  spread  across  sec-
tors. Lots of very good technical people work on an adhoc basis but there is NO stra-
tegic plan or coordinated effort.
Q3c. What  role  can  and  should  DHS  and  other  public  and  private  organizations

play in these response activities?

A3c. DHS  itself  can  do  little  in  the  response,  this  has  to  be  done  by  the  companies
that own the infrastructure itself. DHS can help best in analysis, preparedness and
planning.
Q3d. What  are  the  barriers  to  DHS,  companies  or  other  organizations  providing  a

quick, effective and coordinated response?

A3d. Poor  planning  and  lack  of  understanding  of  interdependencies  and  weak
points  but  most  of  all  TRUST.  DHS  has  done  little  to  foster  trust  with  the  critical
infrastructure companies.
Q4. International Cyber Security
Q4a. In  your  experience  working  with  multiple  Federal  Governments  on  cyber  secu-
rity,  what  notable  differences  exist  between  the  approach  of  the  U.S.  and  that
of other countries?

A4a. The U.S. approach is paradoxical, there seems to be good funding in total but
this is not integrated into a focused program. The lack of continuity and lack of se-
niority  in  the  cyber  security  part  of  DHS  has  led  to  fragmentation  of  the  program
with many activities being started but few big wins to point at. Cyber Security has
taken a back seat especially in R&D—DHS S&T is only spending about $15 million
on cyber security.
Q4b. Are other countries supporting activities that the U.S. should be doing too?
A4b. Delivery  of  specifics  such  as  practical  solutions  from  funded  research,  novel
cyber-intelligence,  and  user-led  security  solutions  fora  have  all  been  seen  to  add
great value in the programs of some other countries.
Q5. What  is  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  doing  to  foster  private  sector  ef-
forts  in  cyber  security  and  what  could  the  agency  do  that  it  is  not  doing  now?
A5. The  ISACs  presented  a  great  opportunity  for  private  sector  engagement,  but
DHS has programmatically eliminated independent ISACs. The initiatives should be
given focus and direction to have specific rather than generic work programs.

Q6. Are  effective  practices  procedures  and  technologies  now  available  to  guard

against the adverse impacts of cyberspace vulnerabilities?

A6. As  we  digitize  more  and  more  we  need  to  have  a  significant  improvement  in
software engineering to create systems of adequate integrity. This philosophy is still
not present in the IT industry.
Q7. Are there shortcomings for particular critical infrastructure areas?
A7. As traditional process control technologies such as SCADA/DCS continue to in-
tegrate  with  Commercial  Off  The  Shelf  IT  systems  we  see  vulnerabilities  and
threats  being  introduced  into  environments  that  cannot  be  changed  to  deal  with
them.  A  new  class  of  co-existing  security  protection  is  required  to  address  legacy
systems until such time as new, built-secure technologies can take their place.

Responses by David E. Kepler, Corporate Vice President of Shared Services and Chief

Information Officer, The Dow Chemical Company

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert

pany?

enough’’?

A1. Dow Chemical has a disciplined process to manage risk and address cyber secu-
rity in our company. The metrics established in this framework allow us to analyze
our  effectiveness  against  priorities,  understand  internal  support  for  addressing
these  priorities,  and  identify  strengths  and  areas  for  improvement  in  our  efforts.
This  framework  also  provides  a  valuable  mechanism  to  compare  our  own  priorities
and  self-assessments  against  those  of  peer  companies.  Our  processes  are  based  on
industry standards and best practices.

Today’s world requires us to maintain constant vigilance and effort to ensure our
security.  There  is  no  foreseeable  point  where  we  as  a  company  can  declare  we  are
‘‘secure  enough.’’  We  must  continue  to  assess  our  risk  and  vulnerabilities  applying
the  necessary  investments,  resources  and  management  systems  to  effectively  man-
age risk and mitigate vulnerabilities on an on-going basis.

The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  cannot  be  everything  to  everyone.
Instead, it is in our national interest for DHS to place a priority and focus on cyber
threats of significant consequence that could interrupt our nation’s critical informa-
tion  and  communications  infrastructure  or  cause  significant  disruption  to  our  econ-
omy.  DHS  should  be  measured  by  how  well  they  plan,  defend,  and  respond  to  such
threats of national consequence.
Q2. Business Case for Cyber Security

Within  your  company,  how  do  you  make  the  business  case  for  the  costs  associ-
ated  with  more  secure  information  technology  products?  What  can  the  Federal
Government  do  to  help  you  make  this  case  and  make  investment  in  cyber  secu-
rity more attractive?

A2. Information systems are critical to Dow Chemical’s business operations and are
integral  to  the  competitive  advantage  of  our  company.  Ensuring  the  reliability  and
security of our systems, processes, and information is of the utmost importance. The
business case for cyber security is very simple for us. If our critical information sys-
tems  or  manufacturing  control  systems  are  compromised,  our  ability  to  conduct
business is compromised. Investments are based on impact to our current operations
and stakeholders, not for benefit return.
Q3. Information Sharing

• What information would you find most helpful to receive from the government
(especially  DHS)  or  from  other  companies  when  you  are  making  decisions  re-
lated to what cyber security you need. When responding to an attack or an in-
cident?
• What information have you been asked for by DHS that you feel uncomfortable
• What are the principal barriers to information sharing: Are changes in the leg-

providing and why?

islation or regulations needed to overcome these barriers?

A3. DHS  should  strive  to  provide  specific  information  regarding  pending  threats,
likely  attacks,  and  recommended  response  plans  where  possible.  Although  under-
standing this is not always feasible, it is necessary to have an ongoing, two-way dia-
logue  with  critical  infrastructure  sectors  on  the  current  threat  environment,  likely
trends, and potential mitigation options.

We  believe  DHS  has  established  programs,  such  as  PCII,  and  continues  to  revise
theses programs as necessary to enable the effective sharing of information from the
private sector to DHS. However, we believe DHS and the private sector communica-
tions  need  to  be  protected  in  both  directions  to  enable  dialogue  on  highly  sensitive
areas.  PCII  only  protects  information  we  submit,  it  does  not  promote  reverse  shar-
ing. An additional concern is the growing number of requests from federal agencies
outside  DHS  and  State  agencies  for  security  and  proprietary  sensitive  information
that could otherwise be protected as PCII. If requested under broad authority grant-
ed  by  various  laws  and  statutes,  the  information  would  be  considered  ‘‘independ-
ently obtained,’’ and would not be protected under existing DHS programs.

Further, even programs within DHS, such as protection of SSI, are not consistent
with  PCII  and  do  not  offer  equivalent  protections.  Efforts  must  be  taken  to  har-
monize the protection of information within DHS and across all governmental agen-
cies  to  ensure  that  critical  security  information  is  not  compromised  and  that  devel-
opment of important security information and sharing of such information is encour-
aged.  We  believe  that  DHS  should  be  empowered  as  the  central  agency  responsible
for the protection of security sensitive and proprietary sensitive information. Redun-
dant  requests  from  other  agencies  should  be  limited,  and  if  information  sharing  is
required across federal, state and local agencies, it must have the same level of pro-
tections provided by PCII.
Q4. Responding to Cyber attacks

• If  the  information  systems  of  a  critical  infrastructure  company  were  attacked
today,  is  the  U.S.  prepared  to  detect  the  attack  and  repel  it  or  repair  the  sys-
tems quickly?

• What about if it were an attack on the Internet?
• What  role  can  and  should  DHS  and  other  public  and  private  organizations
• What  are  the  barriers  to  DHS,  companies  or  other  organizations  providing  a

play in these response activities?

quick, effective and coordinated response?

A4. The  U.S.  must  be  prepared  to  address  high  consequence  cyber  attacks  to  our
nation’s  critical  information  and  communications  infrastructure.  Research  and  de-
velopment  efforts  need  to  be  focused  on  how  best  to  anticipate  and  model,  detect,
defend, and respond to significant interruptions to the Internet and communications
infrastructure.  More  needs  to  be  done  to  focus  attention  on  these  high  risk  con-
cerns—ensuring  adequate  planning,  resources,  and  management  structure  are  in
place to respond to these high-risk scenarios. Less engagement in security and reli-
ability solutions is needed as this is being addressed by marketplace forces.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. What is the Department of Homeland Security doing to foster greater private sec-
tor  efforts  in  cyber  security  and  what  could  the  agency  do  that  it  is  not  doing
now?

A1. DHS is currently initiating a number of projects they believe will increase cyber
security  in  the  private  sector.  However,  these  efforts  are  not  well  coordinated  with
the  private  sector  and  appear  to  lack  coordination  within  the  agency  itself.  A  char-
tered engagement with the Chemical Sector’s Security Program is needed to under-
stand and address the highest areas of risk to our country as it relates to the chem-
ical sector.
Q2. Are  effective  practices,  procedures,  and  technologies  now  available  to  guard
against  the  adverse  impacts  of  cyberspace  vulnerabilities?  Are  there  short-
comings for particular critical infrastructure areas?

A2. Speaking  for  the  chemical  industry,  we  have  established  the  Chemical  Sector
Cyber Security Program to create guidance and reference procedures as well as best
practices  across  our  industry.  For  over  three  years,  this  program  has  actively  en-
gaged to educate large and small chemical companies and to build guidance into in-
dustry programs such as the Responsible Care Security Code.

Although technology is improving, the current approach of releasing software and
infrastructure with security vulnerabilities that requires patching later must be ad-
dressed. Information technology providers must more thoroughly test their products
for existing security threats and apply necessary protections against anticipated fu-
ture  threats.  The  market  appears  to  be  working—incenting  companies  to  provide
much  more  secure  software  and  systems.  However,  if  this  trend  does  not  continue,
government  intervention  may  be  needed  to  ensure  information  technology  is  fully

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Gerald S. Freese, Director of Enterprise Information Security, American

Electric Power

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Measuring Cyber Security
Q1a. How do you measure your company’s cyber security?
A1a. Measurement is most effective against a backdrop consisting of a security pol-
icy and standards. Measurement is accomplished in several ways, depending on the
intended focus:

• Compliance  with  internal  security  standards—measured  against  metrics  de-
rived from self-imposed security requirements (based on business drivers and
best practices).

• Compliance  with  regulatory  requirements—measured  against  externally  gen-

erated security mandates (Sarbanes Oxley, HIPAA, FERC, GLB, etc.).

• Penetration  testing—Tests  technical  security  architecture  for  vulnerabilities.
Provides  multiple  levels  of  security  gap  determinations  and  direction  for  re-
mediation.

Q1b. How  do  you  determine  if  your  company’s  level  of  cyber  vulnerability  is  being

reduced?

A1b. Using  periodic  scanning  of  networks,  servers  and  workstation  for  known
vulnerabilities;  ongoing  compliance  checks  determine  levels  of  compliance  with
standards. Compliance checks rely on the use of technical and process metrics devel-
oped through best practices or regulatory requirements.
Q1c. How do you decide what is secure enough?
A1c. ‘‘Secure enough’’ is determined through analysis of several variables; these are
risk  to  business  systems,  regulatory  requirements  and  the  level  of  security  imple-
mented in the technical architecture.
Q1d. How should DHS determine if the Nation is making progress?
A1d. DHS  must  continue  to  work  toward  comprehensive  information  sharing  with
critical  infrastructure  industries.  The  NIPP  is  an  excellent  start  toward  greater  co-
operation  but  the  PCII  program  needs  to  be  fully  implemented  and  socialized  to  be
effective.
Q1e. Are  government  mandates  needed  to  increase  the  progress  and  get  to  ‘‘secure

enough?’’

A1e. Critical  infrastructure  industries  do  not  want  government  mandates  to  in-
crease  security.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  way  for  the  government  to  effectively
help  protect  critical  infrastructure  if  its  components  do  not  have  some  consistency
in  the  level  of  risk-based  protection  they  have  in  place.  I  feel  that  at  some  point
in the future, government will step in and establish federal requirements. Hopefully
they will do it with full industry collaboration.
Q2. Business Case for Cyber Security
Q2a. Within  your  company,  how  do  you  make  the  business  case  for  the  costs  associ-

ated with more secure information technology products?

A2a. In  several  ways:  Regulatory  or  legislative  requirements;  Risk  identification
and mitigation; Cultivating strong executive support for CI protection.
Q2b. What can the Federal Government do to help make this case?
A2b. The government can provide more pertinent, substantiated threat information.
They  can  also  design  financial  assistance  for  selected  protective  measures.  These
would have to be accomplished with extensive collaboration with the private sector.
Q3. Information Sharing
Q3a. What  information  would  you  find  most  helpful  to  receive  from  the  government
(especially  DHS)  or  from  other  companies  when  you  are  making  decisions  re-
lated to what cyber security you need? When responding to an attack or an inci-
dent?

98

A3a. In question two, we discussed that there is a need for more pertinent and sub-
stantiated  threat  information  from  the  government.  When  responding  to  an  attack
or incident, government sources, outside of some law enforcement liaison, will prob-
ably  be  less  timely  than  commercial  enterprises  specializing  in  early  warning  and
incident  response  measures.  Attacks  or  exploits,  however,  are  threats  come  to  fru-
ition.  Initial  government  involvement  in  early  warning  and  threat  analysis  would
go a long way toward better prevention or deflection of these exploits.
Q3b. What information have you been asked for by DHS that you feel uncomfortable
providing? Why? What are the barriers to information sharing? Are changes in
legislation or regulations needed to overcome these barriers?

A3b. On  numerous  occasions,  federal  and  State  DHS  authorities  have  asked  us  for
information  on  our  critical  assets  and  on  the  protective  measures  (physical  and
cyber) surrounding them. Without the PCII program in place, we are very reluctant
to provide that data, and have repeatedly declined their requests. We cannot be sure
under the current situation of only partial implementation of the PCII program who
will  have  access  to  that  data.  Once  PCII  is  fully  established  and  implemented,  we
will  revisit  information  sharing  and  support  the  effort.  We  are  committed  to  doing
all we can to help the government protect our nation’s critical infrastructure.
Q4. Responding to Cyber Attacks
Q4a. If  the  information  systems  of  a  critical  infrastructure  company  were  attacked
today, is the U.S. prepared to detect the attack and reel it or repair the systems
quickly?

A4a. While  there  are  many  companies  that  have  successfully  repelled  one  or  more
major cyber attacks, many more have not and a good number could not. Those that
have  the  security  technology  and  mature  incident  response  programs  are  usually
well  equipped  to  handle  both  directed  and  general  cyber  attacks.  Those  that  have
few technical solutions in place or that have poorly defined incident response proce-
dures are often victims of even the most well-known and preventable threats. So the
answer  to  this  question  must  be  qualified  with  an  ‘‘it  depends  on  who  is  attacked’’
caveat.  Overall  as  a  country  I  believe  we  are  not  well  equipped  to  repel  such  at-
tacks.
Q4b. What about if the attack were on the Internet?
A4b. If  attacks  are  recognized  quickly  (very  likely)  and  there  are  preventive  meas-
ures  already  in  place  and  properly  configured,  responses  after  a  major  Internet  at-
tack can probably effectively thwart attackers. These measures range from network
and system processes to equipment/communication redundancy.
Q4c. What  role  can  and  should  DHS  and  other  public  and  private  organizations

play in these response activities?

A4c. DHS should be providing the most up to date threat data available, along with
analysis  of  potential  and  actual  cyber  threats.  In  addition,  they  should  provide
awareness information to companies that is substantive, citing examples of attacks,
providing  recommended  solutions  and  adding  real  value  to  the  knowledge  base.  To
make  this  more  meaningful,  DHS  might  want  to  make  this  a  collaborative  effort
with  commercial  companies  that  already  have  a  large  critical  infrastructure  cus-
tomer base.
Q4d. What  are  the  barriers  to  DHS  companies  or  other  organizations  providing  a

quick, effective and coordinated response?

A4d. I  can’t  speak  for  other  companies,  but  regarding  DHS,  it  needs  to  staff  its
ranks with true cyber security experts and be willing to pay the costs of their exper-
tise.  This  does  not  mean  hiring  the  standard  group  of  government  contractors.  It
means  recruiting  individuals  from  the  commercial  world  that  have  industry  credi-
bility, can offer real knowledge and experience and feel that protecting critical infra-
structure is a vital mission for our national security.
Q4e. What is DHS doing to foster greater private sector efforts in cyber security, and

what could the agency do that it is not doing now?

A4e. DHS seems to be addressing most of the right areas as evidenced by the NIPP
draft.  They  are  also  increasing  involvement  in  industry  groups,  making  sure  their
message is being effectively communicating. What they could add is accurate threat
data and greater awareness of the impact that cyber attacks can have on the infra-
structure and economy.

And  they  will  keep  improving.  The  problem  is  that  these  are  not  used  consistently
across all infrastructure organizations. Unfortunately, with cyber security we’re still
only as strong as our weakest link.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Measuring Cyber Security

How  do  you  measure  your  company’s  cyber  security?  How  do  you  determine  if
your company’s level of cyber vulnerability is being reduced? How do you decide
what  is  ‘‘secure  enough’’?  Are  there  specific  metrics  you  use  in  evaluating  the
cyber security of your company? How should the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity  (DHS)  determine  if  the  Nation  is  making  progress?  Are  government  man-
dates needed to increase the progress to get to ‘‘secure enough’’?

A1. There is no single metric or measurement that suffices to describe a company’s
cyber  security  readiness.  SBC  proactively  determines  the  cyber  security  readiness
of  its  environment  through  the  use  of  internal  and  external  audit  reviews,  secure
system  management  compliance,  application  security  compliance,  routine  scans  to
identify vulnerabilities, and periodic component review within the infrastructure. In
addition,  an  annual  assessment  of  deployed  security  solutions  is  conducted  based
upon  new  or  changing  requirements  and  conditions.  SBC  also  has  a  team  of  IT  Se-
curity professionals dedicated to the protection of its internal cyber resources. A key
metric  for  SBC  is  the  number  of  attempted  and  investigated  intrusions  within  the
environment and the corrective actions taken to address them.

As a way to measure private companies’ progress towards cyber security, the De-
partment of Homeland Security could use publicly reported information, such as an-
nual Sarbanes-Oxley disclosure reports.

Government mandates should not be necessary. The DHS could focus on cyber se-
curity  best  practices  and  standards.  Also  helpful  would  be  tools  so  companies  could
measure their compliance towards those best practices.
Q2. Business Case for Cyber Security

Within  your  company,  how  do  you  make  the  business  case  for  the  costs  associ-
ated  with  more  secure  information  technology  products?  What  can  the  Federal
Government  do  to  help  you  make  this  case  and  make  investment  in  cyber  secu-
rity more attractive?

A2. SBC  well  understands  the  need  for  cyber  security,  within  the  company  infra-
structure  and  as  a  service  we  can  provide  to  users  of  our  data  products.  Business
cases  to  support  cyber  security  preparedness  to  protect  internal  cyber  resources
must clearly define the risks to the business, the security tools needed and processes
required, and then should be evaluated based on needs of the business. Most often,
business cases supporting cyber security are developed because of new business op-
portunities,  changing  cyber  technologies,  new  identified  vulnerabilities,  growth  of
our environment, or new legislative requirements.

Awareness of cyber security to the public can show a positive impact to businesses
that  help  support  cyber  infrastructure  (i.e.,  Internet).  The  more  people  understand
virus  protection,  anti-spam  tools,  identity  theft  protection,  and  phishing  risks,  the
better  the  Internet-connected  community  and  services  can  perform  on  their  behalf.
Government  education  programs  that  could  also  be  used  within  businesses  would
help defray internal education costs.
Q3. Information Sharing
Q3a. What  information  would  you  find  most  helpful  to  receive  from  the  government
(especially  DHS)  or  from  other  companies  when  you  are  making  decisions  re-
lated  to  what  cyber  security  you  need?  When  responding  to  an  attack  or  inci-
dent?

A3a. SBC would find it helpful if information from the DHS includes: current cyber
vulnerabilities,  attack  methods,  and  attack  sources.  The  most  current  information
helps  us  prepare  strategies  to  deal  with  new  sources  of  attack  and  new  methods  of
attack.  The  same  can  be  said  when  responding  to  an  incident.  Understanding  how
an  attack  may  occur  and  from  where  allows  SBC  to  better  prepare  defenses  that
could block specific protocols or specific IP addresses.
Q3b. What information have you been asked for by DHS that you feel uncomfortable

providing? Why?

A3b. Information  that  SBC  has  been  asked  to  share  that  has  made  us  uncomfort-
able  includes  items  that  we  consider  private  within  the  company  and  restricted  to

only  employees  with  a  need  to  know.  Examples  include  our  private  address  spaces,
server specifics (numbers, types, versions, and locations), vendors used and security
infrastructure  components.  Typically,  we  are  uncomfortable  with  sharing  informa-
tion that could be used to allow specific, targeted attacks against SBC. We also have
an  expectation  from  and  an  obligation  to  our  customers  to  keep  their  information
private  and  secure.  Release  of  customer  information  to  law  enforcement  should  al-
ways follow the same strict protocol as any other subpoenaed information.
Q3c. What are the principal barriers to information sharing? Are changes in legisla-

tion or regulations needed to overcome these barriers?

A3c. It  has  been  our  experience  that  the  principal  barriers  to  information  sharing
between  companies  are;  competition  within  an  industry,  potential  negative  public
perception  if  cyber  security  intrusions  occur,  and  the  FOIA  or  other  disclosure  acts
requiring  federal  agencies  to  disclose  meeting  proceedings  or  information  provided.
Q4. Responding to Cyber Attacks

If  the  information  systems  of  a  critical  infrastructure  company  were  attacked
today, is the U.S. prepared to detect the attack and repel it or repair the systems
quickly?  What  about  if  it  were  an  attack  on  the  Internet?  What  role  can  and
should  DHS  and  other  public  and  private  organizations  play  in  these  response
activities? What are the barriers to DHS, companies, or other organizations pro-
viding a quick and effective and coordinated response?

A4. I  believe  most  large  companies,  especially  those  within  the  critical  infrastruc-
ture, understand cyber security is a part of doing business within our Internet-con-
nected  world,  today,  and  have  taken  precautionary  measures  to  detect  and  protect
against attacks.

The Internet itself is constantly attacked. The Internet, by definition, is a network
of networks, and, as such, Internet service providers have an ability to segment por-
tions of the network to prevent rampant abuse, if necessary.

Communications is the chief barrier to DHS’ ability to coordinate a rapid and co-
ordinated  response  to  Internet  problems.  To  provide  a  coordinated  response,  the
DHS  needs  the  ability  to  contact  key  Internet  providers  to  focus  on  the  immediate
attack.  This  is  not  unlike  the  telecommunications  requirement  to  have  a  National
Security  Emergency  Preparedness  (NSEP)  organization  which  focuses  on  national
telco events.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. What is the Department of Homeland Security doing to foster greater private sec-
tor  efforts  in  cyber  security,  and  what  could  the  agency  do  that  it  is  not  doing
now?

A1. SBC maintains close ties to government agencies responsible for national secu-
rity.  We  work  closely  with  them  on  a  daily  basis  to  receive  and  share  security  re-
lated  information.  The  DHS  is  encouraged  to  continue  to  support  the  efforts  of  the
following:  the  National  Security  Telecommunications  Advisory  Council  (NSTAC),
National  Coordinating  Center  Telecom  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Center
(NCC  Telecom  ISAC),  FBI’s  Infragard,  and  the  National  Security  Information  Ex-
change (NSIE).

DHS  support  of  public  awareness  and  education  programs  focused  on  cyber  secu-
rity  would  be  a  pro-active  effort  to  help  companies  and  the  public  be  more  aware
of cyber security and the role they play to protect themselves.
Q2. Are  effective  practices,  procedures,  and  technologies  now  available  to  guard
against  the  adverse  impacts  of  cyberspace  vulnerabilities?  Are  there  short-
comings for particular critical infrastructure areas?

A2. SBC utilizes security technologies and practices to guard against adverse cyber
security  vulnerabilities.  We  believe  security  tools  and  practices  exist  for  industries
to  protect  themselves.  Our  challenge  is  addressing  new  vulnerabilities  as  they  ap-
pear.  This  requires  technologies  and  processes  to  continuously  react  to  the  ever-
changing  environment.  Consumers  and  industry  must  continue  to  hold  vendors  ac-
countable  and  to  focus  their  efforts  on  providing  products  and  tools  to  meet  cyber
security best practices. Vendors need to recognize that cyber security is an adminis-
trative intensive effort and tools are needed to relieve this pressure.
