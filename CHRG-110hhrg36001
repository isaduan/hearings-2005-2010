Research, Education and Training
Programs to Facilitate Adoption

of Solar Energy Technologies

TUESDAY, JUNE 19, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Tuesday, June 19, 2007 the House Committee on Science & Technology, Sub-
committee  on  Energy  and  Environment  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on
the Discussion Draft sponsored by Rep. Giffords which establishes several important
research, education, and training programs to facilitate the adoption of solar energy
technologies.

This  bill  addresses  issues  in  solar  research,  education,  and  training  not  covered
by  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005.  These  include  a  research  and  development  pro-
gram on thermal energy storage technologies for concentrating solar power, a study
to determine the necessary steps to integrate concentrating solar power plants with
the regional and national electric grid, a program to ensure that a sufficient number
of  people  are  properly  trained  to  install  and  maintain  solar  energy  equipment,  and
the  establishment  of  a  solar  energy  research  and  information  program,  modeled  on
similar  such  programs  for  the  beef  and  dairy  industries.  The  program  is  supported
by pooling funds from the private sector for the research and promotion of the solar
power industry as a whole.

This  hearing  will  seek  to  address  the  following  issues  relating  to  the  discussion

Draft:

regional and national electric grid be useful?

• Is  thermal  energy  storage  technology  important  to  the  viability  of  concen-
trating  solar  power?  Would  the  increased  research  and  development  on  ther-
mal  storage  proposed  significantly  accelerate  the  advancement  of  this  tech-
nology?
• Would a study on how to integrate concentrating solar power plants with the
• Is  there  a  sufficient  number  of  people  trained  to  install  and  maintain  solar
energy equipment to meet the current and future needs of the solar industry?
Are  such  programs  necessary  or  useful  for  prospective  solar  panel  installers
and potential consumers?
• How would the solar research and information program for the solar industry
authorized  in  the  bill  help  to  support  research  and  promote  the  adoption  of
solar power across the Nation?

Background

The  Discussion  Draft  contains  4  basic  components,  as  described  above.  The  first
two are specifically related to concentrating solar power (CSP). A 2006 report by the
Western Governors’ Association assessed the overall near-term potential for CSP ca-
pacity in the American Southwest, taking into account areas of high solar ray inten-
sity, near-level land, non-sensitivity to CSP use, and proximity to transmission. The
resulting  set  of  potential  plant  sites  totaled  200  GW  of  potential  power  production.
To  put  this  in  perspective,  the  electric  generating  capacity  of  the  entire  United
States  is  currently  about  1,000  GW.  Some  significant  challenges  remain  to  wide-
spread implementation of CSP, however.

CSP  plants  produce  electric  power  by  converting  the  sun’s  energy  into  high-tem-
perature  heat  using  various  mirror  configurations.  The  heat  is  then  channeled
through  a  conventional  generator.  These  plants  consist  of  two  parts:  one  that  col-
lects  solar  energy  and  converts  it  to  heat,  and  another  that  converts  heat  energy

to electricity. Thermal energy storage technology allows this heat to be retained for
later  use  in  generating  electricity,  such  as  during  periods  of  passing  clouds  or  into
the evening. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 establishes a CSP research and develop-
ment program, but storage is not included in the language. Section 3 of the Discus-
sion  Draft  authorizes  a  program  dedicated  to  advancing  research  and  development
in  thermal  energy  storage  for  CSP.  Section  4  of  the  Discussion  Draft  tasks  the  De-
partment of Energy (DOE) with conducting a study on methods to integrate concen-
trating  solar  power  with  regional  electricity  transmission  systems,  and  to  identify
new  transmission  or  transmission  upgrades  needed  to  bring  electricity  from  high
concentrating  solar  power  resource  areas  to  growing  electric  power  load  centers
throughout  the  United  States.  The  results  of  this  study  will  help  define  a  roadmap
for  large-scale  implementation  of  CSP  to  meet  the  Nation’s  growing  energy  needs.
The  other  two  components  of  Discussion  Draft  address  the  solar  industry  in  gen-
eral. Having a certified, well-trained workforce to install and maintain solar energy
products  is  critical  to  the  success  of  the  industry.  Some  states,  such  as  New  York
and  Florida,  working  with  local  community  colleges,  businesses,  the  Interstate  Re-
newable Energy Council (IREC), and the North American Board of Certified Energy
Practitioners  (NABCEP)  have  recently  established  successful  programs  to  create  a
workforce  to  meet  local  demand,  however  there  is  currently  no  federal  program  to
help establish or improve these training programs across the Nation. Section 5 cre-
ates such a program, authorizing $10 million in each year from FY08 through FY12.
This  section  instructs  DOE  to  ensure  sufficient  geographic  distribution  of  training
programs  nationally,  and  to  only  award  grants  for  programs  certified  by  the  Insti-
tute  of  Sustainable  Power  or  equivalent  industry-accepted  quality-control  certifi-
cation  institution,  or  for  new  and  growing  programs  with  a  credible  path  to  certifi-
cation.

A successful model for promoting a particular U.S. commodity, rather than an in-
dividual brand, has been demonstrated by the agriculture industry. Funded entirely
by  a  small  portion  of  industry  revenues  and  overseen  by  the  USDA,  organizations
such as the Cattlemen’s Beef Promotion and Research Board and the National Dairy
Board  were  created  to  coordinate  mutually  beneficial  research  efforts  and  increase
awareness of their industry as a whole, as well as ensure that consumers knew the
proper  certification  standards  to  seek  out  before  making  a  purchase.  Modeled  after
these  examples,  Sections  6–13  create  the  Solar  Industries  Research  and  Promotion
Board,  overseen  by  DOE,  which  would  similarly  plan  and  conduct  mutually  bene-
ficial solar industry research efforts, increase awareness of solar as an energy option
across the Nation, and ensure that consumers know what certifications a technician
should  have  for  installation  or  maintenance  of  solar  energy  equipment.  The  Solar
Energy  Industries  Association  (SEIA)  has  expressed  a  strong  interest  in  creating
such a program.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Welcome  to  today’s  hearing  entitled  ‘‘Research,
Education  and  Training  Programs  to  Facilitate  Adoption  of  Solar
Energy Technologies.’’ I want to thank Chairman Gordon, Ranking
Member  Hall,  Chairman  Lampson  and  Ranking  Member  Inglis  for
holding this hearing on solar energy this morning. Solar energy of-
fers  one  of  the  best  solutions  to  the  greatest  challenges  facing  our
nation,  global  warming,  dependence  on  foreign  oil  and  concerns
about American competitiveness.

It  has  tremendous  potential  across  the  United  States,  especially
in  regions  like  Southern  Arizona,  where  we  have  over  300  days  of
sunshine every single year.

Solar  energy,  as  we  all  know,  is  a  nonpartisan  issue.  The  sun
beats  down  on  Republicans  and  Democrats  and  Independents  with
equal intensity, and we could all benefit from harnessing the power
of the sun. It stimulates business development. It creates new jobs,
helps protect our environment, and promotes energy independence.
My legislation, entitled the Solar Energy Research and Advance-
ment Act of 2007, will move solar energy forward by targeting some
of  the  gaps  that  several  experts  have  identified  in  our  national
solar energy strategy.

Today  we  are  going  to  hear  from  experts  on  the  discussion  draft
that  was  earlier  circulated.  This  is  a  great  first  step  in  the  overall
solar energy agenda for the 110th Congress. I am considering other
pieces  of  legislation  and  I  know  that  other  House  committees  are
looking  at  solar-related  bills  as  well.  As  we  move  forward,  the  cu-
mulative  efforts  to  focus  on  the  use  of  solar  energy  should  be  very
positive.

Let  me  briefly  summarize  the  four  components  of  this  bill.  The
first  component  would  establish  a  Thermal  Energy  Storage  Re-
search  and  Development  Program  within  the  Department  of  En-
ergy.  This  will  help  us  solve  perhaps  the  most  significant  problem
with concentrated solar power technology: energy storage. We need
more  advanced  technology  so  that  we  can  store  solar  energy  pro-
duced  during  the  day  and  use  it  at  night  or  on  a  cloudy  day.  This
is  all  about  energy  reliability  and  viability.  We  need  to  assure  the
public  that  they  will  have  enough  electricity  when  the  sun  goes
down and when they need it.

The  second  component  would  require  DOE  to  conduct  two  con-
centrating  solar  power  commercial  application  studies.  One  would
study  methods  to  integrate  concentrated  solar  power  energy  into
regional  electricity  transmission  systems.  The  best  time  of  the  day
to produce and use solar energy is from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. We need
to research how to connect the major solar power plants to the elec-
tric  grid,  relieve  expensive  demand  on  electric  utilities  and  use
solar energy during these peak hours. It also makes sense to exam-
ine how to bring electricity from high solar resource areas like Ari-
zona  and  Nevada  to  other  parts  of  the  United  States  that  have
other energy needs as well.

The other study would require DOE to inform Congress on meth-
ods to reduce the amount of water consumed by concentrating solar
power  systems.  CSP  has  its  greatest  potential  in  the  southwest
United  States,  and  like  all  power  plants,  it  requires  tremendous
use  of  water.  Given  the  strain  on  water  resources  already  in  this

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

6

region,  we  must  research  ways  to  research  water  consumption  so
that we can realize the benefits of CSP technology.

The  third  component  of  the  legislation  will  authorize  a  competi-
tive grant program at DOE to create and strengthen solar industry
workforce  training  and  internship  programs  in  installation,  oper-
ation  and  maintenance  of  solar  energy  products.  The  goal  of  this
program  is  to  ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  well-trained  individ-
uals  to  support  the  expansion  of  the  solar  energy  industry.  If  we
want  to  increase  our  use  of  solar  energy,  we  have  to  make  sure
that  we  have  a  trained  and  qualified  workforce.  This  section  will
promote job growth in a fast-growing solar industry.

Lastly, we have got beef for dinner and we have all got milk, but
who  has  gone  solar?  The  fourth  component  of  this  bill  will  create
a  Solar  Energy  Industries  Research  and  Commercial  Application
Board  to  plan  and  coordinate  projects  of  research  and  commercial
application, certification, information and other purposes of benefit
to  the  application  of  solar  technologies  and  educate  people  on  why
we  need  to  be  doing  this.  This  public-private  partnership  will  also
help the general public understand how they can benefit from solar
energy  technology.  I  want  to  note  that  this  program  will  be  paid
for by the solar industry and will cost the taxpayer absolutely noth-
ing.  It  is  important  to  my  constituents  and  all  the  other  people’s
constituents as well.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the

aisle to pass this important legislation.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Giffords follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE GABRIELLE GIFFORDS

I  want  to  thank  Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Member  Hall,  Chairman  Lampson,

and Ranking Member Inglis for holding this hearing on solar energy today.

Solar  energy  offers  one  of  the  best  solutions  to  the  greatest  challenges  facing  our
nation—global  warming,  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  and  concerns  about  American
competitiveness.

It  has  tremendous  potential  across  the  United  States,  especially  in  regions  like

Southern Arizona, where we have over 300 days of sunshine every year.

Solar  energy  is  a  non-partisan  issue.  The  sun  beats  down  on  Democrats,  Repub-
licans,  and  Independents  with  equal  intensity,  and  we  can  all  benefit  from  har-
nessing the power of the sun.

It  stimulates  business  development,  creates  new  jobs,  helps  protect  our  environ-

ment, and promotes energy independence.

My legislation, entitled the Solar Energy Research and Advancement Act of 2007,
will  move  solar  energy  forward  by  targeting  some  of  the  gaps  that  several  experts
have identified in our national solar energy strategy.

Today,  we  will  hear  expert  opinions  on  the  discussion  draft  that  was  circulated.
This  is  a  great  first  step  in  the  overall  solar  energy  agenda  for  the  110th  Con-
gress. I am considering other pieces of legislation, and I know that other House com-
mittees  are  looking  at  solar-related  bills.  As  we  move  forward,  the  cumulative  ef-
forts to advance the use of solar energy should be very positive.

Let me briefly summarize the four components of this bill.
The  first  component  would  establish  a  ‘‘Thermal  Energy  Storage  Research  and
Development  Program’’  within  the  Department  of  Energy.  This  will  help  us  solve
perhaps the most significant problem with concentrating solar power technology: en-
ergy  storage.  We  need  more  advanced  technology  so  that  we  can  store  solar  energy
produced  during  the  day  and  use  it  at  night  or  on  a  cloudy  day.  This  is  all  about
energy  reliability  and  viability.  We  need  to  assure  the  public  that  they  will  have
enough electricity when the sun goes down.

The  second  component  would  require  DOE  to  conduct  two  ‘‘Concentrating  Solar

Power Commercial Application Studies.’’

One  would  study  methods  to  integrate  concentrating  solar  power  energy  into  re-
gional electricity transmission systems. The best time of the day to produce and use
solar energy is from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. We need to research how to connect major solar

power plants to the electric grid, relieve expensive demand on electric utilities, and
use  solar  energy  during  these  peak  hours.  It  also  makes  sense  to  examine  how  to
bring  electricity  from  high  solar  resource  areas,  like  Arizona  and  Nevada,  to  meet
energy needs throughout the United States.

The other study would require DOE to inform Congress on methods to reduce the
amount of water consumed by concentrating solar power systems. CSP has its great-
est  potential  in  the  Southwest  United  States,  and  like  all  power  plants,  it  requires
the  use  of  water.  Given  the  strain  on  water  resources  in  this  region,  we  must  re-
search ways to reduce water consumption so that we can realize the benefits of CSP
technology.

The third component of this legislation will authorize a competitive grant program
at  DOE  to  create  and  strengthen  solar  industry  workforce  training  and  internship
programs  in  installation,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  solar  energy  products.  The
goal  of  this  program  is  to  ensure  an  adequate  supply  of  well-trained  individuals  to
support  the  expansion  of  the  solar  energy  industry.  If  we  want  to  increase  our  use
of  solar  energy,  we  have  got  to  make  sure  that  we  have  a  trained,  qualified  work-
force. This section will promote job growth in the fast-growing solar industry.

Lastly,  we’ve  got  beef  for  dinner,  and  we’ve  all  got  milk.  But  who’s  gone  solar?
The fourth component of this bill will create a Solar Energy Industries Research and
Commercial Application Board to plan and coordinate projects of research, commer-
cial application, certification, information, and other purposes of benefit to the appli-
cation  of  solar  technologies.  This  public-private  partnership  will  also  help  the  gen-
eral  public  understand  how  they  can  benefit  from  solar  energy  technology.  I  want
to  note  that  this  program  will  be  paid  for  by  the  solar  industry  and  will  cost  the
taxpayer absolutely nothing.

I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  to  pass

this important legislation.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  The  Chair  now  recognizes  the  Ranking  Member

from South Carolina, Mr. Inglis, for an opening statement.

Mr. INGLIS. I thank the Chair for holding this legislative hearing

on facilitating the adoption of solar energy technologies.

Solar  energy  occupies  just  a  sliver  of  the  global  energy  market.
However,  when  you  consider  the  Earth  receives  more  energy  from
the  sun  in  just  one  hour  than  the  world  uses  in  a  whole  year,  it
makes  sense  that  we  should  look  into  making  that  thin  sliver  into
a  big  piece  of  the  energy  pie.  With  some  advancements  in  tech-
nology  and  conversion  efficiencies,  solar  will  fit  the  bill  for  our  en-
ergy goals: clean, renewable and abundant.

Today  we  are  going  to  discuss  draft  legislation  that  seeks  to  ad-
dress  ways  that  the  Federal  Government  can  help  speed  commer-
cial viability of solar energy. I look forward to hearing from our ex-
pert panel of witnesses as to how we might meet our goals.

Madam Chairman, as we discuss these proposals today and move
to markup, I hope we give adequate time to make this bill as good
as  it  can  be.  America’s  scientists,  engineers,  inventors  and  entre-
preneurs  realize  the  potential  of  solar  power  and  other  renewable
sources,  and  I  hope  we  can  set  policies  that  facilitate  the  develop-
ment, the best development of those sources.

Thank  you  again  for  holding  the  hearing  and  I  look  forward  to

hearing from our witnesses.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

I  am  very  pleased  to  be  here  this  morning  to  discuss  the  legislation  proposed  by
my colleague from Arizona, Rep. Giffords. Solar energy holds great promise and po-
tential to deliver clean, affordable electricity to homes and businesses across the Na-
tion.

Rep. Giffords has identified several areas where federal support could further the
goal  of  diversifying  our  energy  supply  by  expanding  the  adoption  of  solar  energy
technologies.  The  basic  and  applied  research  and  development  programs  that  we
have invested in through the Department of Energy over the years have yielded sig-
nificant  advancements  in  solar  energy  technologies.  Our  challenge  now  is  to  move
these technologies into the market place more aggressively.

I  also  serve  on  the  Committee  on  Agriculture.  In  the  agricultural  sector,  USDA
has managed numerous promotion programs for agricultural commodities that have
helped  to  educate  consumers  about  the  nutritional  benefits  of  different  foods  and
have  expanded  markets  for  all  commodity  producers.  I  believe  it  provides  a  good
model for solar energy technologies and will deliver additional applied research and
information  designed  to  communicate  with  the  general  public  to  support  the  entire
solar industry.

My  home  State  of  Texas  has  moved  aggressively  to  encourage  the  development
of  renewable  energy.  We  have  abundant  solar  resources  that  could  be  used  to  fur-
ther  expand  our  renewable  energy  portfolio.  As  several  of  our  witnesses  will  point
out  today,  the  U.S.  has  significant  solar  potential  that  we  are  not  yet  taking  full
advantage of. We can no longer afford to overlook obvious opportunities to diversify
our energy supply.

I  commend  my  colleague  for  her  work  on  this  legislation  and  I  look  forward  to
moving  it  forward  in  our  committee  very  soon.  We  have  an  excellent  panel  of  wit-
nesses  today  that  will  help  us  to  refine  this  legislation  and  expand  our  use  of  the
abundant, clean source of energy.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  Morning.  Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  for  holding  today’s  hearing  to  receive
testimony on the discussion draft legislation sponsored by Congresswoman Giffords.
The  bill  establishes  research,  education,  and  training  programs  to  facilitate  the
adoption of solar energy technologies.

My  home  State  of  Illinois  has  a  plentiful  supply  of  coal,  which  is  why  our  region
specializes in clean coal research and demonstration projects. In the West, solar en-
ergy and thermal energy storage is also an environmentally friendly energy source.
Regardless  of  where  you  live  in  the  country,  I  believe  it  is  important  to  invest  in
multiple energy sources to ensure the U.S. has diverse a energy portfolio.

Specifically, the Discussion Draft with regard to thermal energy storage addresses
an  important  issue  related  to  solar  energy  and  its  impact  on  utilities.  Adding  ther-
mal  storage  to  concentrated  solar  power  (CSP)  plants  enables  solar  energy  to  be  a
potentially  provided  at  a  low  cost,  which  is  critical  for  our  nation’s  economy.  Fur-
ther,  the  discussion  draft  also  addresses  transmission  integration,  an  important
issue for CSP plants.

Similar to clean coal technologies, cost is the greatest obstacle with regard to pro-
ducing  solar  power.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  on  how  the  solar
research and information program for the solar industry authorized in the bill would
help to support research and promote the adoption of solar power across the Nation.
With that, I again thank the Chairman for calling this hearing.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  fabu-
lous,  fabulous  panel  of  witnesses  with  some  Arizona  connections,  I
would  also  like  to  point  out.  I  always  bring  it  back  to  Arizona.  We
have Mr. Hayden, who is Solar Technology Coordinator for Arizona
Public  Service  Corporation.  Mr.  Rhone  Resch  is  the  President  of
the Solar Energy Industries Association. Ms. Jane Weissman is the
Executive Director of the Interstate Renewable Energy Council and
the  Vice-Chair  of  the  North  American  Board  of  Certified  Energy
Practitioners. I just have to mention that Ms. Weissman earlier has
talked  about  1991  at  the  Westford  Look  Hotel  in  Tucson  where  a
lot of this work actually began, so I think that is pretty interesting.
We  also  have  Professor  Joseph  Sarubbi,  who  is  the  Chair  of  the
Building  Systems  Technology  Department  at  Hudson  Valley  Com-
munity  College,  and  Mr.  Daniel  Arvizu,  who  is  the  Director  of  the
Department  of  Energy’s  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory
and originally from Douglas, Arizona. So that is very cool.

So  as  our  witnesses  should  know,  spoken  testimony,  we  would
like  to  try  to  limit  to  five  minutes  after  which  the  Members  of  the
Committee  will  have  five  minutes  to  ask  questions,  and  as  far  as
I  know,  we  are  okay  on  time  in  terms  of  votes,  so  no  particular
pressure  here  to  speed  through  this.  But  let  us  get  going  with  Mr.
Hayden, please.
STATEMENT  OF  MR.  HERBERT  T.  HAYDEN,  SOLAR  TECH-
NOLOGY  COORDINATOR,  ARIZONA  PUBLIC  SERVICE  COM-
PANY, PHOENIX, ARIZONA
Mr. HAYDEN. Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee,
my  name  is  Herbert  T.  Hayden.  I  am  the  solar  technology  coordi-
nator for Arizona Public Service Company, APS, in Arizona. Thank
you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  to  you  today  regarding  concen-
trating  solar  power,  or  CSP.  CSP  is  a  technology  of  great  interest
to  APS  for  its  potential  to  provide  lower  cost  and  more-reliable
solar power in the desert Southwest.

I  would  like  to  submit  my  written  comments  to  you  and  briefly
summarize  them  now  on  the  main  points,  which  are,  number  one,
the importance of thermal energy storage to the viability of concen-
trating  solar  power;  number  two,  the  importance  of  reduction  of
water use to the viability of concentrating solar; and number three,
how a study to integrate concentrating solar power plants with the
electric  grid  can  facilitate  the  commercialization  and  implementa-
tion of large-scale CSP.

APS  is  the  largest  and  longest  serving  electric  power  utility  in
Arizona,  the  fastest  growing  state  in  the  Nation.  We  are  adding
customers  at  three  times  the  national  average  and  electricity  de-
mand  is  growing  at  four  times  the  national  average.  To  meet  this
rapid  growth  in  electricity  demand,  Arizona’s  electric  utilities  are
investing  over  $2  billion  a  year  in  infrastructure.  Plans  for  the  fu-
ture  include  conventional  generation,  new  transmission  and  dis-
tribution, and an increased focus on conservation and cost-effective
renewable energy resources.

In  Arizona,  our  most  abundant  renewable  resource  is  sunshine.
For the past 15 years, my responsibility has been to work with the
solar  industry  and  researchers  around  the  United  States  and  the
world  to  bring  lower  cost  and  reliable  solar  electricity  to  our  cus-
tomers. From a technology perspective, our primary focus has been
on technologies that can be lower cost on a utility scale in the near-
term.  As  early  as  1995,  the  APS  STAR  Center  was  a  test  site  for
dish Stirling systems and for the advancement of concentrating PV
systems,  both  of  which  are  forms  of  concentrating  solar  power.
Based  on  inquiries  from  companies  around  the  world,  it  seems
clear  that  our  work  has  helped  stimulate  the  growing  interest  in
concentrating solar power technology.

One of the most successful CSP technologies to date are the solar
trough  systems  that  use  solar  heat  to  drive  turbine  engines  and
generators.  For  more  than  a  decade,  solar  trough  plants  in  Cali-
fornia  have  been  the  largest  collection  of  solar  power  in  the  world
and  they  have  operated  well.  CSP  is  currently  the  most  cost-effec-
tive  solar  technology  for  large-scale  use  and  has  the  potential  to
compete with conventional generation in the near- to mid-term.

Because of this potential, last year APS completed the first solar
trough  plant  in  the  United  States  in  over  14  years,  the  one-mega-
watt  APS  Saguaro  Solar  Trough  plant  near  Tucson,  Arizona.  Our
intent of that project was to help reestablish and again advance the
U.S. solar trough technology. In short order, the APS plant was fol-
lowed by a much larger project in Nevada which has benefited from
the new solar collector design experience gained in the APS project.
An important attribute of the CSP systems is the ability to incor-
porate thermal storage into the design to improve the reliability of
power  output.  This  is  an  extremely  important  feature  that  many
intermittent renewable resources such as PV and wind do not have.
All  renewables  have  value  for  the  ability  to  help  reduce  the  use  of
fossil  fuels  but  the  ability  to  store  the  thermal  energy  for  times
when it is needed provides for a reliability that does not exist with
intermittent resources. This is especially critical to utilities because
they  have  the  obligation  to  provide  reliable  power  at  all  times.  It
is commonly considered that solar provides power when it is need-
ed the most, during the daytime. This is largely true but there are
fluctuations  due  to  clouds  and  a  rolloff  of  solar  before  the  late  day
hours of high power consumption. For example, power consumption
in  Arizona  reaches  a  peak  in  the  months  of  July,  August  and  Sep-
tember  and  the  summer  heat  results  in  heavy  air  conditioning
loads.  During  that  period,  Arizonans  use  the  most  energy  between
5 and 7 p.m. when they go home, increase the air conditioning and
do  things  for  their  lives.  But  unfortunately,  the  solar  resource
peaks  sometime  in  the  mid-afternoon  and  tails  off  significantly  as
the  sun  lowers  on  the  horizon.  Thermal  storage  has  the  potential
to  bridge  the  gap  between  maximum  solar  generation  and  peak
customer  demand  by  extending  the  hours  of  operation  sufficiently
to cover much of the evening demand.

There has already been some support in the national labs for the
development  of  thermal  storage  concept  and  we  recognize  and  ap-
preciate  that  past  support.  However,  the  resources  are  apparently
limited  in  comparison  to  the  substantial  expense  of  a  meaningful
development and test plant. Certainly a dedicated research and de-

11

velopment  program  on  thermal  storage  could  significantly  accel-
erate the use of this promising technology.

Another key area for improvement of CSP is water use. The cur-
rent  design  of  large  CSP  plants  use  water  simply  for  cooling  a
power  plant  in  the  same  way  that  water  is  used  for  conventional
power  plant  cooling.  Though  CSP  technology  has  been  successful
with its current water cooling approaches, growth in the desert has
placed  ever-increasing  demands  on  water  use  and  reductions  in
water use would increase the attractiveness of CSP.

On  the  third  topic  relating  to  CSP  of  the  study  of  integrating
large  CSP  plants  into  the  regional  and  national  electric  grid,  it  is
true  that  planning  for  CSP  does  raise  numerous  issues  including
the  availability  of  land,  land-use  issues  such  as  water  and  permit-
ting, and increasingly, the availability of transmission facilities and
transmission capacity to deliver the energy to load centers from the
areas  where  solar  might  be  developed.  Transmission  is  generally
constrained  in  much  of  the  West  and  significant  new  transmission
investment  is  needed  in  the  coming  years  for  all  types  of  genera-
tion, renewable or conventional. The Southwestern states and utili-
ties,  including  APS,  are  considering  the  needs  and  benefits  for
transmission  to  ensure  a  robust  grid  to  meet  the  needs  of  the
West’s rapidly growing population. A federal study of the potential
for  the  integration  of  CSP  into  the  transmission  plans  would  be
timely and supportive of the further commercial implementation of
CSP and could help address the same kind of issues that have been
encountered in the successful growth of the wind industry.

So finally, we are currently leading a group of southwestern utili-
ties  in  the  exploration  of  a  250-megawatt  CSP  plant  to  be  built  in
the  Southwest.  In  the  process,  we  have  run  into  these  issues—
transmission,  water,  et  cetera.  Also,  land  on  federal  land  could  be
considered.

So  finally,  I  would  just  say  that  we  believe,  APS  believes  that
large-scale CSP has very good potential to provide cost-effective en-
ergy to the United States. We also believe that the U.S. industries
have still been a leader in concentrating technologies and have the
opportunity  to  benefit  by  that,  and  finally  that  CSP  can  be  im-
proved  with  the  additional  of  thermal  storage  and  with  reduction
of water use and the proper integration of CSP in the national grid.
Thank  you,  Madam  Chairman  and  the  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee  for  the  opportunity  to  share  these  observations  with  you,
and  I  would  be  available  to  answer  questions  if  I  can.  Thank  you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HERBERT T. HAYDEN

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  a  pleasure  to  provide  testimony
to you regarding 1) the importance of thermal energy storage technology to the via-
bility  of  concentrating  solar  power,  and  2)  how  a  study  to  integrate  concentrating
solar power plants with the electric grid can facilitate the commercialization and im-
plementation of large-scale CSP.

Arizona  Public  Service  Company  (APS)  is  the  largest  and  longest  serving  electric
power  utility  in  Arizona.  Arizona  is  also  the  fastest  growing  state  in  the  United
States.  APS  is  adding  customers  at  three  times  the  national  average  and  our  cus-
tomers’  electricity  demand  is  growing  at  four  times  the  national  average.  To  meet
this rapid growth in electricity demand Arizona’s electric utilities are investing over
$2 billion a year in infrastructure. Plans for the future include conventional genera-
tion, new transmission and distribution and an increased focus on conservation and
cost effective renewable energy resources.

In  Arizona  our  most  abundant  renewable  resource  is  sunshine.  And,  for  the  past
15  years,  my  responsibility  has  been  to  work  with  the  solar  industry  and  research-
ers  around  the  U.S.  and  the  world  to  bring  lower  cost  and  reliable  solar  electricity
to our customers.

APS’ first work in the solar technology area was .in 1954 when APS helped orga-
nize the first International Solar Energy Exposition in Phoenix, AZ that lead to the
formation  of  the  International  Solar  Energy  Society.  In  the  1970’s,  APS  applied
early  solar  PV  technology  in  remote  off-grid  telecommunications  applications,  and
since the early 1980’s APS has been an active participant in the study and develop-
ment of solar energy for large scale utility use.

In  1988,  the  APS  Solar  Technology  Applied  Research  (STAR)  center  was  devel-
oped to support the advancement of solar resources, including field operation of both
photovoltaic  (PV)  and  concentrating  solar  technologies.  Our  early  work  at  STAR
gave APS the expertise and experience to undertake several noteworthy projects in-
cluding  Arizona’s  first  customer-sited  PV  systems  tied  to  the  grid,  and  Arizona’s
first  utility  scale  grid-tied  solar  PV  system.  APS  is  proud  to  provide  solar  services
to  the  National  Park  Service  and  several  military  bases  in  Arizona  to  assist  with
the use of PV in support of remote off-grid operations. And, we currently have over
five  MW  of  PV  tracker  power  plants  in  operation  providing  reliable  solar  energy  to
our customers.

From  a  technology  development  perspective  our  primary  focus  has  been  on  large
scale  solar  technologies.  As  early  as  1995,  APS  STAR  center  was  a  test  site  for  the
dish Stirling systems, and the advancement of Concentrating PV (CPV) systems. We
have  more  then  10  years  experience  operating  silicon  CPV,  and  three  years  ago  in-
stalled  the  Nation’s  first  grid-tied  triple-junction  high  concentration  PV  system.
Based upon inquiries from companies around the world it seems clear that our CPV
work  has  helped  stimulate  new  interest  in  CPV  technology.  And  while  there  is  sig-
nificant CPV work now being undertaken in other countries, it is my belief that the
United  States  remains  in  the  technological  lead  of  this  very  promising  solar  tech-
nology.

In  another  very  promising  technology  area,  APS  has  supported  the  advancement
of  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP).  These  technologies  are  ‘‘thermal  electric  sys-
tems’’ that use solar heat to drive engines and generators. CSP thermal systems in-
clude solar trough concentrator systems and central receiver (power tower) systems
that  use  many  mirrors  to  focus  light  on  a  central  solar  collector.  CSP  also  include
solar dish Stirling systems and other advanced solar concepts.

The solar trough systems are worth particular note. For more then a decade solar
trough  systems  in  California  have  been  the  largest  collection  of  solar  power  in  the
world,  and  they  have  operated  well.  CSP  is  also  currently  the  most  cost  effective
solar  technology  and  has  the  greatest  potential  to  compete  economically  with  con-
ventional generation in the near to mid-term.

Because  of  this  potential,  just  last  year,  APS  constructed  the  first  solar  trough
plant in the U.S. in over 14 years. Our intent was to help to re-establish and again
advance  the  U.S.  solar  trough  technology.  The  plant  is  the  one  MW  APS  Saguaro
Solar Trough plant, near Tucson, Arizona.

While not part of the Saguaro design, an important attribute of the solar thermal
CSP systems is the ability to incorporate thermal storage techniques into the design
to  improve  the  reliability  of  power  output.  This  is  an  extremely  important  feature
that  many  intermittent  renewable  resources  such  as  PV  and  wind  do  not  have.
While  all  renewables  have  value  for  their  ability  to  help  reduce  the  use  of  fossil
fuels,  the  ability  to  store  the  thermal  energy  for  times  when  its  needed  provides  a
level of reliability that does not exist with intermittent resources. This is especially
critical to utilities that have an obligation to provide reliable power at all times.

Common  wisdom  is  that  solar  technologies  produce  power  when  it  is  needed  the
most,  during  the  daytime.  While  this  is  largely  true,  there  are  exceptions  that  are
not  obvious  such  as  fluctuations  due  to  clouds  and  a  mismatch  to  late-day  power
consumption.  This  latter  exception  is  the  norm  for  Arizona  and  most  of  the  desert
southwest.  In  the  southwest,  power  consumption  reaches  its  peak  in  the  months  of
July,  August  and  September,  when  the  summer  heat  result  in  heavy  air  condi-
tioning  loads.  The  correlation  between  power  consumption  and  high  summer  tem-
peratures are a good match for CSP however the correlation is not as perfect as one
might  expect.  In  a  24  hour  period,  Arizonan’s  use  the  most  energy  in  the  early
evening,  between  5  and  7  p.m.,  when  they  return  home  from  work,  turn  down  the
air  conditioning,  cook  dinner,  do  laundry  and  generally  go  about  their  lives.  Unfor-
tunately, solar electricity production, even from CSP, does not match this hourly de-
mand profile very well. Solar electricity production reaches its peak levels sometime
in the mid-afternoon and tails off significantly in the early evening as the sun low-

ers  on  the  horizon.  Thermal  storage  has  the  potential  to  bridge  the  gap  between
maximum generation and peak demand.

Without  the  availability  of  solar  energy  during  the  peak,  utilities  must  look  to
other  reliable  resources  like  natural  gas  to  meet  customer  demand.  But,  thermal
storage has the real potential to change utility resource decisions because with stor-
age  CSP  systems  will  be  able  to  reliably  serve  customers  when  electricity  costs  are
the highest.

There  currently  exists  some  support  in  the  national  labs  for  the  development  of
the  thermal  storage  concept,  which  we  recognize  and  appreciate.  However  the  re-
sources are apparently limited in comparison to the substantial expense of a mean-
ingful development and test plant. Certainly a dedicated research and development
program  on  thermal  storage  could  significantly  accelerate  the  use  of  this  promising
technology.

The  second  topic  of  discussion  relating  to  CSP  is  the  integration  of  large  CSP
plants into the regional and national electric grid. This topic raises numerous issues
including  availability  of  land  for  large  scale  installation,  land-use  issues  such  as
water  use  and  permitting  and  the  availability  of  transmission  facilities  and  trans-
mission  capacity  to  deliver  the  energy  to  load  centers.  The  cost,  timing  and  risks
associated with each of these factors must also be considered.

One  additional  aspect  of  large  scale  CSP  that  must  be  considered  is  the  status
of  financial  incentives.  Currently,  the  30  percent  Investment  Tax  Credit  (ITC)  for
solar  has  resulted  in  projected  project  costs  that  are  significantly  more  competitive
than any time in the past. But without a long-term extension of the ITC, many large
scale  CSP  projects  will  never  be  launch  due  to  the  time  it  takes  to  address  the
issues  noted  in  the  preceding  paragraph.  Large  scale  CSP  plants  require  three  to
five  years  from  commitment  to  start  up  Today,  the  ITC  is  set  to  expire  at  the  end
of  2008.  The  one  to  two  year  ITC  extensions  that  have  been  typical  in  previous
years, will not provide sufficient certainty to enable major CSP development. Long-
term extension of the ITC is critical to CSP development.

One critical aspect of the ITC is the fact that it is not available to public utilities.
The restriction needlessly narrows application of the credit and is unfair to U.S. citi-
zens because the vast majority purchase power from a public utility, as it is defined
by  the  tax  code.  Therefore,  a  utility  wishing  to  plan  a  large  CSP  resource  would
need to assume no ITC, or secure a third-party owner of the plant. This current pol-
icy forcing a third-party relationship to take advantage of the ITC creates unneces-
sary  uncertainty  and  costs  to  the  system.  It  forces  the  utility  and  regional  grid  to
consider the operational and financial risks inherent in any third party relationship
thus affecting the utility operating strategies. These risks can certainly be analyzed
and  managed  but  create  a  potential  sub-optimum  situation  when  they  are  the  only
strategy available.

While  there  are  numerous  issues  to  be  addressed,  APS  is  bullish  about  CSP  and
is  leading  a  group  of  southwestern  utilities  exploring  a  250  MW  CSP  plant  in  the
desert  southwest.  We  have  found  several  constraints  to  a  successful  project  includ-
ing  the  financial  factors  associated  with  the  end  of  the  ITC  in  2008,  and  the  lack
of  transmission  capacity.  In  fact,  transmission  is  generally  constrained  in  much  of
the west and significant new transmission investment is needed in the coming years
for all types of generation be they renewable or conventional generation. New trans-
mission  is  being  planned  throughout  the  west  and  in  California  and  Texas  specifi-
cally  to  access  renewable  resources  including  wind  and  geothermal.  Others  states
and  utilities,  including  APS,  are  studying  their  needs  for  both  intra  and  interstate
transmission  to  ensure  a  robust  grid  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  West’s  burgeoning
population.  The  studies  include  the  ability  to  reach  those  areas  of  the  west  with
abundant low cost renewable resources.

Answers  to  the  questions  about  CSP,  and  indeed  renewables  in  general,  are  not
simple.  Intermittent  renewable  resources  such  as  wind  and  solar  present  special
economic challenges for transmission investment because they do not efficiently uti-
lize the transmission investment at all times. Wind integration studies have and are
being  performed.  We  believe  CSP  has  a  significant  potential  to  provide  large
amounts  of  renewable  energy  to  the  U.S.  and  that  a  federal  study  on  transmission
for large scale CSP would be beneficial and appropriate.

Finally  the  issue  of  locating  large  scale  CSP  on  federal  land  should  be  inves-
tigated  and  analyzed.  By  its  nature,  solar  technologies  require  significant  geo-
graphic footprints. A general rule of thumb for a solar installation is five to 10 acres
per megawatt. That means for a single 250 megawatt facility, 1,250 to 2,500 contig-
uous  acres  of  land  would  be  required.  Considering  that  the  Federal  Government  is
the  largest  land  owner  in  the  U.S.,  a  study  of  federal  land  in  high  solar  resource
areas that may be made available for CSP development would also be beneficial and
appropriate.

In  summary,  APS  is  proud  of  its  contributions  to  the  advancement  of  solar  tech-
nologies  including  CSP,  but  more  needs  to  be  done.  APS  believes  that  large  scale
CSP has the best potential to provide cost effective solar energy to the U.S. and this
potential  improves  dramatically  with  the  addition  of  thermal  storage.  Under-
standing  how  these  large  CSP  installations  will  impact  the  regional  and  national
grid  must  be  understood.  We  support  federal  funding  for  a  CSP  integration  study.
We encourage additional federal attention and support for CSP and welcome the op-
portunity to continue to work with the U.S. national labs and the solar industry on
the further advancement of solar resources into our national energy portfolio.

Thank you Mr. Chairman and the Members of the Committee for the opportunity

to share these observations and opinions with you.

BIOGRAPHY FOR HERBERT T. HAYDEN

Since  1993,  Herb  Hayden  has  led  the  development,  construction  and  operation  of
solar  power  plants  for  APS,  the  largest  and  longest-serving  electric  utility  in  Ari-
zona.  Over  six  Megawatts  (MW)  of  solar  generation  has  been  installed  to  date  by
APS,  including  photovoltaic  (PV)  and  advanced  concentrator  solar  power  systems
(CSP). These CSP systems include Concentrating PV (CPV) and one MW of Concen-
trating Solar Trough thermal generating systems.

Herb  has  managed  the  development  of  new  solar  technologies  that  have  placed
APS  in  a  leadership  role  for  solar  systems  of  particular  promise  for  utility  use.
These  include  larger-scale  PV  tracking  systems  using  present-day  commercial  PV
panels,  and  the  high  concentration  PV  (CPV)  and  dish-engine  systems  that  are
emerging  to  address  the  price  and  supply  limitations  of  conventional  PV  products.
Much  of  this  work  is  visible  at  the  APS  Solar  Test  And  Research  (STAR)  center,
where new solar technologies are under test in the Arizona environment.

In addition to grid-connected solar, Herb initiated the development of the APS Re-
mote  Solar  Electric  Service.  This  program  provided  off-grid  solar  power  services  to
50  homes  and  ranches  in  Arizona,  as  well  as  several  unique  larger  scale  ‘‘solar  hy-
brid’’  systems  for  military,  national  park  and  commercial  customers  in  the  U.S.
southwest and Mexico.

Herb  is  a  PE  in  Arizona,  having  received  his  BSEE  with  honors  from  Arizona
State  University  in  1983.  Prior  to  his  solar  work  at  APS,  Herb  performed  project
management  and  engineering  for  APS  telecommunications  systems,  and  worked
four years at Motorola in the development of advanced electronic systems.

STATEMENT OF MR. RHONE RESCH, PRESIDENT, SOLAR

ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION

Mr.  RESCH.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson,  Congresswoman
Giffords  and  the  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  for  providing  me
the  opportunity  to  testify  on  these  important  issues  this  morning.
My name is Rhone Resch. I am President of the Solar Energy In-
dustries  Association,  a  trade  group  here  in  Washington  that  rep-
resents over 500 companies and over 20,000 people employed in the
U.S.  solar  energy  industry  including  hundreds  of  small  businesses
throughout the United States.

I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  and  its  staff  for  providing
true  leadership  in  advancing  solar  energy  in  the  United  States.  A
key element of leadership is providing the opportunity to empower
others to lead and today you seek to empower individual Americans
to  strengthen  our  energy  independence,  to  become  high-tech  work-
ers,  adopters  and  advocates  for  solar  technologies  that  can  help
meet America’s energy challenges in the 21st century.

With  regard  to  the  establishment  of  a  check-off  program  for
solar, I would like to convey three points. First, the high priority—
the highest priority for the solar energy industry is the creation of
a  long-term  incentive  for  solar  to  help  lower  costs  and  provide  a
clear  market  signal  to  manufacturers  to  actually  expand  produc-
tion.  Only  then  will  we  have  a  supply  to  meet  the  demand  of  an
educated  market  and  only  then  will  a  check-off  program  succeed.
Second,  solar  energy  technologies  provide  significant  energy  secu-
rity,  environmental,  and  economic  benefits  to  the  American  public
and  must  be  a  significant  part  of  our  energy  portfolio  going  for-
ward.  And  third,  the  solar  industry  would  greatly  benefit  from  the
creation of a federal check-off program just as dozens of other U.S.
industries have benefited from these programs.

While  solar  prices  have  dropped  by  90  percent  in  the  last  25
years, solar is still two to three times as expensive as the national
retail  electricity  rates.  Furthermore,  the  United  States  has  been
eclipsed  by  Germany,  Japan  and  China  in  the  manufacturing  and
use  of  solar.  Incredibly,  Germany  installs  eight  times  the  amount
of  solar  each  year  as  the  United  States  despite  having  the  same
amount of sunlight as Anchorage, Alaska, as you can see from this
map  here.  When  you  do  look  at  that  map,  you  can  see  that  the
United States really does have world-class solar resources in all 50
states. Certainly if you can make solar work well in Germany, you
can  make  it  work  well  in  all  50  states  in  the  United  States.  But
Germany enjoys market leadership because its government has en-
acted  long-term  incentive  policies  that  have  jump-started  the  in-
stallation  market.  Congress  is  currently  considering  legislation  to
extend the federal solar investment tax credits for homeowners and
businesses, H.R. 550, the Securing America’s Energy Independence
Act.  Specifically,  these  bills  will  create  an  eight-year  extension  in
expansion of the ITC for commercial systems and an eight-year ex-

tension  in  expansion  for  the  residential  systems.  I  want  to  com-
mend  Chairman  Gordon,  Subcommittee  Ranking  Member  Inglis,
Congresswoman Giffords, Congressman Udall, Congressman Baird,
Congressman Bartlett, Congressman McCaul for co-sponsoring this
important legislation without which a check-off program would not
galvanize in the United States. We need to have this policy support
in  place  to  make  the  domestic  industry  competitive  in  the  global
marketplace  for  solar  technologies,  and  I  respectfully  request  that
the  Committee  reach  out  to  Chairman  Rangel  of  the  Ways  and
Means  Committee  and  ask  him  to  support  the  provisions  in  H.R.
550  and  the  tax  title  of  the  energy  bill  which  will  be  marked  up
tomorrow.

Solar  energy  is  the  Nation’s  most  abundant  energy  resource  and
it  can  greatly  improve  the  U.S.’s  ability  to  have  a  secure  and  reli-
able energy supply. Solar requires no field to operate and our pan-
els  are  warrantied  to  last  for  20  to  25  years,  and  you  will  see  a
panel  being  put  up  here  in  just  a  minute,  and  this  is  one  of  the
things  to  point  out.  Once  you  install—once  you  buy  and  install  a
solar system on your house, it is like buying a car with all the gas
you  will  need  for  it  for  its  entire  lifetime.  Sure,  it  has  most  of  a
cost  upfront  but  it  will  hedge  the  consumer  against  rising  energy
prices in the future. And on a community scale, solar can help sta-
bilize  volatile  electricity  prices  and  relieve  tight  markets  for  nat-
ural  gas  by  reducing  demand  during  midday  peak  when  the  most
expensive, least efficient generation is used.

Moreover,  solar  is  the  cleanest  method  of  electricity  generation.
Electricity  for  solar  produces  no  air  pollution,  no  water  pollution,
no  noise  pollution,  no  radiation,  no  solid  waste,  has  no  impact  on
wildlife,  except  maybe  inconveniencing  the  squirrels  that  are  run-
ning  around  on  your  roof,  and  uses  no  water  for  generating  elec-
tricity,  an  increasingly  important  issue  for  the  fast-growing  com-
munities of Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, California and Colorado,
as Herb just pointed out.

As  we  begin  to  tackle  climate  change  in  a  real  manner,  keep  in
mind  that  over  the  40-  to  50-year  life  of  a  solar  electric  system,
every  kilowatt  of  solar  electric  power  reduces  217,000  pounds  of
CO2.

Finally,  as  today’s  hearing  demonstrates,  there  are  tremendous
economic benefits to be gained form increasing our use of solar en-
ergy.  Solar  photovoltaic  creates  32  jobs  per  megawatt,  more  than
any  other  form  of  energy.  Solar  could  provide  more  than  tens  of
thousands  of  new  jobs  in  the  coming  decade  in  manufacturing,  en-
gineering, construction and installation, investing America’s energy
dollars in America’s workers.

If  we  are  to  begin  harnessing  this  potential,  we  must  signifi-
cantly  increase  consumer  education  and  awareness  of  solar  tech-
nologies.  While  the  public  strongly  supports  the  increased  use  of
solar,  market  research  shows  a  broad  gap  in  the  understanding
that  solar  electricity  operates  just  like  regular  electricity  and  that
solar can work anywhere in the United States. Many outdated mis-
conceptions exist that the technology must be overcome in order for
consumers’  use  to  increase  of  solar.  As  you  can  see,  this  is  a  solar
electric panel. Most people still think that solar looks like the tech-
nology  on  Skylab,  checkerboard  pattern,  inefficient  use.  This  is

made by a company in the United States. It looks like a flat-screen
TV. It is the most efficient panel made in the world, 22 percent effi-
cient,  absolutely  gorgeous.  I  actually  put  it  up  on  my  house  last
year.  It  generates  about  85  percent  of  my  electricity  right  here  in
Washington, D.C. It is very exciting. But consumers lack the infor-
mation  on  how  to  find  solar  companies  and  what  solar  products
might be available, and most solar installation companies are small
businesses,  typically  employing  no  more  than  a  few  dozen  people
and lacking the budget to reduce a broad swath of consumers.

So in short, the solar industry needs to launch a national aware-
ness  campaign  and  numerous  other  industries  have  provided  us
with  a  blueprint  to  do  so.  Congressionally  created  check-off  pro-
grams  have  served  as  the  backbone  of  many  industries’  successful
promotion campaigns. Mr. Chairman, I am sure we are all familiar
with the dairy industry’s ‘‘Got Milk,’’ the cotton industry’s ‘‘Cotton,
The  Fabric  Of  Our  Lives’’  and  the  National  Pork  Board’s  ‘‘Pork,
The  Other  White  Meat.’’  But  Mr.  Chairman,  no  pork  was  involved
in the creation of these campaigns, at least no Congressional pork.
Rather,  these  industries  pooled  their  resources  through  a  com-
prehensive program to fund consumer education. A ‘‘Got Solar’’ pro-
gram,  if  you  will,  would  provide  major  benefits  to  the  American
public.  Consumers  would  be  able  to  obtain  market  information  on
product and company quality and become educated about local and
national  energy  use  patterns.  Meanwhile,  local  solar  installers
would  benefit  from  broad  public  outreach  that  they  would  other-
wise be unable to afford and see the resultant growth in their busi-
ness.

To  be  clear,  consumer  awareness  is  only  one  major  obstacle  to
the widespread use of solar and a check-off program can only work
if  we  have  proper  market  incentives  and  market  mechanisms  in
place.

I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to
speak,  and  I  am  available  to  answer  any  questions  that  you  may
have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Resch follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RHONE RESCH

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  for  providing  me

the opportunity to testify today.

On  behalf  of  over  500  companies  and  more  than  20,000  employees  in  the  U.S.
solar energy industry, I would like to express support for the Solar Energy Research
and  Advancement  Act  of  2007,  legislation  that  would  help  solar  energy  to  make
major  strides  in  contributing  to  a  clean,  domestic,  renewable  supply  of  electricity
that  is  of,  by,  and  for  the  American  people.  SEIA  applauds  Congresswoman
Gabrielle Giffords for her visionary leadership in introducing this bill.

My  comments  today  will  focus  on  the  importance  of  a  solar  check-off  program,  or
‘‘Got Solar,’’ to the future utilization of solar energy resources in the U.S. Aside from
cost,  the  greatest  obstacle  to  solar  reaching  a  wider  domestic  market  is  education
and public awareness. With respect to a ‘‘Got Solar’’ program, I would like to convey
the following points:

• Greater use of carbon-smart, domestic solar energy would have myriad energy

security, economic, and environmental benefits for the American public.

• While the public broadly supports the greater use of solar energy, most Amer-
icans  do  not  have  a  basic  understanding  of  solar  technology  products  or  how
to purchase them.

• Educating  the  public  on  solar  energy  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  the
solar  industry,  but  most  solar  installers  are  small  businesses  that  lack  the
means to reach a broader swathe of consumers.
• Building  on  dozens  of  U.S.  industries’  successful  examples,  Congress  should
establish a coordinated program of promotion and research, funded by indus-
try at no cost to the government, to increase consumer education about solar
energy.
• Finally, a check-off program will only succeed if appropriate incentives are in
place,  including  an  eight-year  extension  of  the  federal  investment  tax  credits
(ITC).

Public Benefits of Solar Energy

The  U.S.  solar  energy  industry  is  growing  and  providing  more  carbon-smart,  do-
mestic energy every year. Solar energy technologies can provide major energy secu-
rity, environmental, and economic benefits to the American public, all of which will
be realized with broader consumer awareness and adoption of solar.
Energy Security

As Congress looks to increase the use of carbon-smart renewable energy, it is crit-
ical  that  priority  be  placed  on  technologies  that  also  improve  U.S.  energy  security.
Solar energy, in all of its forms, is a technology that can greatly improve the U.S.’s
ability to have a secure and reliable energy supply.

The  electricity  infrastructure  in  the  U.S.  is  aging  and  energy  consumers  are  in-
creasingly subject to outages that affect critical infrastructure and disrupt business.
The  blackout  of  August  2003  in  the  Northeast,  triggered  by  a  tree  limb  landing  on
power lines, cost consumers and businesses tens of billions of dollars. Unfortunately,
this  event  is  not  unique  and  will  occur  with  greater  frequency  if  Congress  does  not
take steps to diversify our energy portfolio.

The  good  news  is  that  this  event  could  easily  have  been  avoided  through  greater
use  of  solar  energy.  A  2004  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  study  entitled  Solution
to  the  Summer  Blackouts?  concludes  that  if  solar  energy  had  met  just  one  percent
of  local  peak  demand,  we  would  have  avoided  the  August  2003  blackout  and  other
local brown-outs. DOE’s explanation was simple: high air conditioning loads stressed
the grid and created the circumstances for the blackout. This extreme load occurred
on  one  of  the  hottest  and  sunniest  days  during  the  summer—the  exact  time  when
output from solar systems is greatest. DOE also concluded that over reliance on cen-
tral  generating  stations  led  to  grid  fatigue  and  failure.  This  infrastructure  vulner-
ability could have been minimized through greater reliance on distributed solar en-
ergy.

Photovoltaic  (PV)  and  solar  water  heating  systems  are  distributed  generation
(DG)  technologies.  Like  other  DG  technologies,  they  provide  energy  at  the  point  of
consumption rather than at a central power plant hundreds of miles away. As such,
DG  does  not  rely  on  vulnerable  regional  transmission  lines  and  local  distribution
networks. By producing energy at the source of consumption, solar power alleviates
stress and vulnerability on the grid.

The  DOE  study  also  concluded  that  investing  in  solar  energy  is  a  more  economi-
cally efficient and cost effective way to improve our energy infrastructure than cap-
ital  intensive  and  often  community-opposed  transmission  line  upgrades  and  brand-
new transmission lines. In sum, using solar energy is a cost-effective, affordable way
to  alleviate  stress  on  the  electricity  grid  and  improve  the  overall  reliability  of  our
electricity infrastructure.

Solar is also the most reliable source of energy. This reliable track record has re-
sulted  in  wide  deployment  of  the  technology  in  applications  where  power  interrup-
tions are unacceptable, including: oil and gas industry use of solar energy to power
pumps  and  meters  at  remote  locations;  telecommunications  industry  use  of  solar  to
power relay stations and remote equipment; and, every satellite that has been sent
out into space in the last 30 years has been powered by solar energy.

Ironically,  energy  industry  acceptance  of  the  technology  stands  in  stark  contrast
to  consumer  behavior.  Consumers  are  investing  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in
small gasoline-powered generators. During grid failure and electricity outages, elec-
tronic gasoline pumps at the gas stations do not operate, rendering many generators
idle  because  of  fuel  shortage.  Solar  energy  is  a  technology  that  can  provide  reliable
power during power outages.

Finally,  solar  stabilizes  volatile  energy  prices,  a  critical  energy  security  issue  af-
fecting the U.S. today. In the last five years, consumers have seen electricity prices
escalate  between  20  and  78  percent.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  seen  the  price  of
natural  gas  triple  and  the  price  of  gasoline  routinely  exceed  $3.00  per  gallon.  Each

year  the  cost  of  energy  is  taking  a  larger  percentage  of  a  family’s  income  than  at
any other time in U.S. history. This energy inflation vulnerability especially impacts
the poor and elderly on fixed incomes.

Solar  can  help  address  this  vulnerability  because  it  requires  no  fuel  to  operate.
Although  a  solar  system  is  more  expensive  up  front,  there  are  no  additional  costs
for operating a system once installed. Furthermore, solar panels are guaranteed for
20–25 years, allowing consumers to ‘‘lock in’’ their electricity prices for decades. Rec-
ognizing the upward trend in energy costs, incentivizing the use of a technology that
requires no fuel inputs is an important element of any energy security plan.
Energy Independence

Solar  energy  is  a  domestic  and  abundant  energy  source  in  the  U.S.  The  U.S.  has
the best solar resources of any developed country in the world. Proportionally, U.S.
solar  energy  resources  exceed  those  of  fossil,  nuclear  or  other  renewable  energy  re-
sources. Despite this tremendous advantage, the U.S. has failed to capture and har-
ness  this  free  and  readily  available  energy.  In  2006,  solar  energy  produced  just  1/
30th of one percent of all electricity in the U.S.; Germany in contrast, with the solar
resources  of  Alaska,  installed  seven  times  more  solar  energy  property  than  the  en-
tire U.S.1

The  U.S.  is  over-dependent  on  foreign  sources  of  energy.  Demand  for  natural  gas
continues  to  rise,  primarily  for  electricity  generation.  Increasingly  we  are  turning
to countries like Algeria to provide us with liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet our
growing  demand.  According  to  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  41  new
LNG  terminals  are  proposed  for  construction  in  U.S.  harbors  and  off  U.S.  beaches.
Constructing these plants will exacerbate our addiction to foreign sources of energy.
Our desire for energy independence demands a different course.

Solar  energy  directly  displaces  natural  gas  used  for  heating  homes  and  water.  In
a home, solar can directly replace natural gas used to heat radiant systems and can
displace up to 70 percent of the natural gas used to generate hot water. Many coun-
tries  that  do  not  have  a  domestic  source  of  fossil  fuels,  including  Spain  and  Israel,
mandate  that  all  new  homes  must  have  solar  water  heating  systems  installed.  The
U.S. can demonstrate similar energy independence by using market incentives that
spur solar investment and market growth.

Solar energy also displaces natural gas used to generate electricity. Almost all in-
termediate  and  peaking  electricity  plants  use  natural  gas  as  the  source  of  energy.
These  plants  are  often  very  inefficient  and  produce  expensive  electricity.  Solar  en-
ergy, which generates electricity from 8 A.M.–7 P.M. daily, can displace these ineffi-
cient,  high  cost  power  plants,  and  become  a  reliable  source  of  firm,  dispatchable
power. Given the high price of natural gas to key industrial sectors and consumers,
the U.S. can no longer afford to neglect its abundant solar resources.

In addition to tempering natural gas demand growth, solar can also generate elec-
tricity  to  be  used  by  plug-in  hybrids  and  electric  vehicles,  thereby  displacing  gaso-
line  derived  from  foreign  oil  supplies.  Imagine  a  gasoline-free  electric  vehicle  that

also  uses  electricity  derived  from  the  sun  rather  than  a  coal-fired  plant.  The  tech-
nology is advancing rapidly in this direction.
Environmental Benefits

Though  the  environmental  benefits  of  solar  energy  might  be  considered  a  given,
it  is  worth  highlighting  several  points.  Solar  is  the  cleanest  method  of  energy  gen-
eration,  in  terms  of  avoided  air,  waste  and  noise  pollution,  energy  payback,  water
conservation,  avoided  radiation  and  harm  to  wildlife,  or  environmental  risk  in  the
event of an accident.

Solar  energy  produces  no  greenhouse  gases,  no  acid  precipitation  or  toxic  emis-
sions,  and  no  other  air  pollution  of  any  kind.  Over  the  40–50  year  life  of  a  solar
electric  system,  every  kilowatt  (kW)  of  solar  electric  power  reduces  217,000  pounds
of carbon dioxide, 1500 pounds of sulfur dioxide, and 830 pounds of nitrogen oxides
emissions as compared to electricity produced by conventional generation.2

Photovoltaic solar energy generates electricity without use any water. In contrast,
fossil fuel and nuclear based electricity generation use substantial amounts of water
to run steam turbines. Across the western United States, approximately 40 percent
of  fresh  water  withdrawals  are  used  for  electric  generation.3 If  water-starved  com-
munities like Phoenix and Las Vegas are to continue growing, we must place great-
er emphasis on water-free electricity generating technologies.

Concerns  have  been  raised  whether  the  energy  used  to  produce  solar  panels  is
surpassed by the amount of energy generated from the panels. This energy relation-
ship  is  referred  to  as  the  ‘‘energy  payback  period.’’  Currently,  the  energy  payback
for  PV  panels  varies  from  1–4  years  depending  on  different  manufacturing  vari-
ables.  This  means  that  a  PV  panel  with  a  life  expectancy  of  40–50  years  will  gen-
erate  between  10  and  50  times  more  energy  than  was  required  to  create  the  panel.
Despite  this  superior  ‘‘energy  return  on  investment,’’  the  manufacturing  process  is
still growing more efficient every year as the scale of production increases.4
Strong Public Support Exists for Greater Solar Development

Polls  consistently  reflect  that  the  American  public  strongly  supports  the  acceler-
ated use of solar technologies. For example, a 2005 poll by the Yale Center of Envi-
ronmental  Law  and  Policy  2005  found  that  90  percent  of  Americans  support  build-
ing  more  solar  power  facilities  to  help  reduce  U.S.  dependence  on  energy  imports.
A  Roper  Public  Affairs  poll  conducted  in  May  2007  found  that  nearly  90  percent  of
Americans  believe  home  builders  should  offer  solar  power  as  an  option  for  all  new
homes  constructed.  And  73  percent  of  those  surveyed  in  another  Roper  survey  in
2006  said  that  solar  energy  technology  is  more  important  today  than  ever  in  re-
sponding to America’s energy challenges.

In general, Americans would like to see the Federal Government take a more ac-
tive role in promoting solar development. A February 2006 poll by the Pew Research
Center  found  that  82  percent  of  respondents  favored  increasing  federal  funding  for
research  on  wind,  solar  and  hydrogen  technology.  A  March  2006  ABC  News/Time/
Stanford  University  poll  found  that  87  percent  favored  tax  breaks  for  companies  to
produce more electricity from water, wind and solar. Note that these policies would
require the use of taxpayer funds, unlike a check-off program.

Finally,  polling  surveys  demonstrate  that  Americans  are  willing  to  pay  more  for
solar  technologies  under  certain  conditions.  An  April  2007  study  by  the  New  York
Times and CBS News found that 75 percent of Americans were willing to pay more
for  solar  electricity  if  it  helped  reduce  global  warming.  Meanwhile,  one-half  of  re-
spondents  in  the  May  2007  Roper  survey  said  they  would  spend  up  to  10  percent
more  for  a  solar-equipped  house  when  told  that  solar  homes  have  a  proven  higher
resale  value.  A  majority  of  respondents  cited  the  financial  and  energy  savings  of  a
solar  system  as  the  main  benefit  of  buying  a  solar  system,  indicating  that  con-
sumers  are  assessing  solar  for  its  potential  savings  benefits  and  would  support  a
program that drives down the cost of solar.
Need for Improved Consumer Education About Solar

However,  while  87  percent  of  respondents  to  the  New  York  Times/CBS  News  poll
supported  the  use  of  solar  to  generate  electricity,  just  three  percent  of  respondents
said that they used solar to generate heat, hot water, or electricity. That is actually
a  far  higher  solar  use  percentage  than  amongst  the  American  public  at  large,  but
it nevertheless illustrates the gap between broad public support for solar and its de
minimis use today.

Though  growing  exponentially  and  constantly  innovating,  the  U.S.  solar  industry
is still in a nascent period. As mentioned above, solar PV provides less than 1/30th
of  one  percent  of  the  current  U.S.  electricity  supply.  Furthermore,  PV  is  primarily
a  distributed  generation  technology  that  is  installed  on  the  rooftops  of  homes  and
businesses throughout the U.S.—a paradigm shift from the traditional model of cen-
tralized  electricity  generation.  Most  solar  installation  companies  are  small  busi-
nesses, typically employing no more than a few dozen people, and lacking the budg-
et to reach a broad swathe of consumers.

Thus,  even  as  consumers  embrace  the  idea  of  solar  power,  they  are  usually  not
fully  aware  of  its  capabilities  and  they  have  misconceptions  about  how  a  solar  en-
ergy  system  works  in  a  home.  Market  reports  demonstrate  a  lack  of  consumer  un-
derstanding  that  solar  electricity  operates  just  like  regular  electricity  and  is  the
same kind of electricity that a local utility company provides. 29 percent of respond-
ents  to  the  May  2007  Roper  survey  were  not  aware  that  solar  energy  can  power
common  electric  devices  like  computers  or  appliances.  A  number  of  common  myths
persist  about  modern  solar  technology,  such  as  the  belief  that  solar  will  not  work
in places outside of the Sunbelt or that solar devices require more energy to manu-
facture than they produce in their lifetime, and these myths often inhibit consumer
consideration of solar as a viable energy source.

Furthermore, consumers lack information on how to find solar companies or what
solar  products  might  be  available.  On  a  daily  basis,  the  most  common  phone  calls
to SEIA come from consumers who ask, ‘‘Where can I find solar for my home?’’ The
industry has taken a number of steps to centralize this type of information, includ-
ing  the  development  of  a  national  solar  installer  directory,  Findsolar.com.  Individ-
ually,  several  companies  have  undertaken  consumer  awareness  campaigns  that
focus  on  basic  technology  education.  Yet  these  efforts  clearly  do  not  equate  to  the
potential reach of a national consumer awareness campaign.
Benefits of a Solar Check-Off Program

A  ‘‘Got  Solar’’  program,  based  on  a  successful  model  used  by  other  industries,
would address the above concerns by creating an industry-funded national education
campaign  on  the  benefits  of  solar  energy.  Collectively,  the  industry  would  pool  its
resources through an industry-wide program to fund this educational effort.

SEIA  anticipates  major  benefits  both  to  the  consumer  and  to  the  industry  with
the  creation  of  a  check-off  program.  Consumers  would  increasingly  have  the  infor-
mation they need to ‘‘go solar.’’ As the availability of market information increases,
consumers would be better able to conduct due diligence on product and firm quality
before  purchasing  a  system.  Educated  consumers  could  convince  their  businesses,
local utilities, and public representatives to adopt solar energy and promote its use.
And  the  program  would  also  help  to  drive  down  the  costs  of  solar  to  the  consumer
over  time,  creating  a  market  demand  signal  that  would  help  companies  to  rapidly
increase production for the U.S. market and achieve economies of scale.

22

The  solar  industry  would  also  reap  the  benefits  of  increased  consumer  education
and  focused  demand,  which  would  translate  into  industry  growth.  A  vibrant  and
well-functioning  market  system  would  greatly  help  to  make  the  domestic  industry
competitive  in  the  global  marketplace  for  solar  energy  technologies.  The  benefits  of
increased awareness of solar would accrue to a wide group of small-to mid-sized in-
dustry  players  (installers,  local  integrators,  equipment  suppliers),  many  of  whom
would not be able to afford this type of broad public outreach and education.
Successful Precedents for a Solar Check-Off Program

The ‘‘Got Solar’’ program is based on a very successful model used in other indus-
tries  to  increase  consumer  awareness  of  their  product.  Check-off  programs  have
helped  fund  the  dairy  industry’s  ‘‘Got  Milk’’  campaign,  the  American  Egg  Board’s
‘‘Incredible Edible Egg,’’ the America’s Cotton Producers and Importers’ ‘‘Cotton, the
Fabric of Our Lives,’’ and the National Pork Board’s ‘‘Pork, the Other White Meat.’’
In  each  case,  a  piece  of  legislation  similar  to  the  ‘‘Got  Solar’’  program  created  a
board  that  collects  a  small  assessment  from  each  of  the  industry’s  members.5 The
funds are then directed toward education and public awareness campaigns.

Two examples of well-functioning check-off programs can be found in the oil heat-
ing and beef industries. The oil heating industry pushed for passage of the National
Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA) Act of 2000, which assesses a charge of $.002 per
gallon  produced  on  members  of  the  oil  heating  industry.  The  program  has  allowed
an  otherwise  fragmented  industry  to  pool  its  resources  for  advertising  and  also  for
crucial  research  and  development.  NORA  uses  the  funds  to  help  development  new
oil heating technologies, bringing better products with higher efficiencies to the pub-
lic.

In  another  well-known  example,  the  Beef  Promotion  and  Research  Act  of  1985
charges  cattle  producers  and  importers  $1  per  head  of  cattle,  with  the  assessments
overseen  by  the  Beef  Board  and  going  to  fund  the  National  Cattlemen’s  Beef  Asso-
ciation. The program brings in millions of dollars per year to fund public education
and  advertising  campaigns,  including  the  popular  ‘‘Beef,  It’s  What’s  for  Dinner’’
campaign. This check-off program has been the backbone of the modern beef indus-
try in the United States.

The beef industry’s check-off program has undergone close economic analysis since
it  was  established.  The  most  recent  report,  by  Dr.  Ron  Ward  of  the  University  of
Florida, studying the check-off program from 2000–2004, showed the program to be
an exceptionally good method of growing an industry’s market. The study found that
for  every  dollar  invested  in  the  check-off  program,  there  was  an  industry  return  of
$5.6
Need for Legislative Authority

For  a  solar  check-off  program  to  be  effective,  it  must  be  established  through  the
legislative  process.  Historically,  industries  have  organized  voluntary  check-offs,  but
they  account  for  only  a  small  share  of  all  funding  for  generic  efforts.  Hundreds  of
mandatory  farm  commodity  promotion  programs  have  been  legislated  by  states  or
the  Federal  Government.  Nine  out  of  ten  U.S.  farmers  were  contributing  to  one  or
more of these efforts by the mid-1990s.7

5 Examples of statutes establishing check-off programs include: National Oilheat Research Al-
liance  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§ 6201;  Commodity  Promotion,  Research,  and  Information  Act,  7  U.S.C.

and Wheat Foods Research and Nutrition Education Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 3401–3417; Floral Research
and  Consumer  Information  Act,  7  U.S.C.  §§ 4301–4319;  Dairy  Production  Stabilization  Act,  7

The adoption of a check-off program would ensure that all companies, both domes-
tic  and  foreign,  participate  in  a  campaign  to  educate  consumers  on  solar  energy
technologies.  Authority  to  collect  assessments  is  facilitated  by  the  government  for
the practicalities of dealing in interstate commerce and the realities of enforcement
to eliminate the problem of ‘‘free riders,’’ or nonpaying companies that might other-
wise benefit economically from programs that others have funded.

The  establishment  of  legislative  authority  would  help  ensure  that  a  solar  check-
off program would succeed. Though it may be viewed as an industry-imposed ‘‘tax,’’
it  is  a  tax  that  is  established  by  the  industry,  with  the  blessing  of  members  of  the
industry,  and  for  the  benefit  of  the  industry.  Thus,  the  industry  would  have  the
power  to  periodically  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  program,  with  a  focus  on  its
economic benefits to industry members.
Comments on the Solar ERA Proposal

SEIA  requests  a  few  key  modifications  to  the  proposed  check-off  program  in  the
Solar  ERA  Act.  First,  current  language  would  exclude  SEIA  from  nominating  its
member  companies  to  the  Board  of  the  new  organization,  and  SEIA  would  not  be
able  to  have  a  representative  participate  on  the  Board.  As  the  national  trade  asso-
ciation  representing  the  industry,  SEIA  would  appropriately  play  a  significant  role
in  a  national  industry  consumer  awareness  and  education  campaign.  Therefore,  we
request  that  the  criteria  for  eligible  groups  be  modified  to  provide  SEIA  with  the
opportunity to nominate candidates and directly participate in Board activities.

Second,  while  we  support  a  scheduled  industry  referendum  on  the  continuation
of  the  program,  we  believe  that  the  current  22-month  target  date  does  not  provide
enough time for the creation of a new organizational infrastructure and the develop-
ment,  testing,  and  execution  of  a  national  campaign.  We  request  that  the  target
date  be  set  no  earlier  than  four  years  from  the  passage  of  legislation.  Additionally,
we believe that the current 10 percent threshold of companies needed to request fu-
ture referenda is too low and could potentially derail the program from being effec-
tive, and we propose that the threshold be raised to a minimum of 25 percent.
Conclusion

A  ‘‘Got  Solar’’  program  would  be  a  sound  investment  in  our  country’s  energy  fu-
ture. By providing a mechanism to increase consumer awareness about solar energy
products,  we  can  empower  the  American  consumer  to  become  part  of  the  solution
to  the  energy  challenges  we  face  as  a  society.  A  check-off  program  would  see  more
of our energy purchasing dollars go towards an economically vibrant domestic man-
ufacturing  and  installation  base,  and  promote  a  carbon-smart,  domestically  pro-
duced energy source from the most abundant source on the planet—the sun.

Thank  you  very  much  for  your  consideration  of  my  testimony.  I  look  forward  to

answering any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR RHONE RESCH

Rhone  Resch  is  the  President  of  the  Solar  Energy  Industries  Association  (SEIA),
the  national  trade  association  of  the  solar  energy  industry.  In  this  capacity  he  is
responsible for managing all aspects of the trade association and ensuring their suc-
cess in advancing solar energy in the U.S.

SEIA  represents  all  solar  technologies  and  serves  as  the  voice  of  solar  energy  in
the United States and is responsible for all market analysis and lobbying on behalf
of the solar industry with Congress and the Administration. SEIA’s recent successes
include  the  creation  of  the  residential  and  commercial  tax  credits  in  the  2005  En-
ergy Policy Act and an expansion of the Department of Energy’s solar program budg-
et from $84 million to $175 million. SEIA also orchestrates public campaigns work-
ing with the media to help shape public support for solar energy.

Mr.  Resch  has  over  15  years  of  experience  in  clean  energy  and  energy  efficiency,
both  in  the  private  sector  and  the  Federal  Government.  Prior  to  coming  to  SEIA,
he  was  Senior  Vice  President  of  the  Natural  Gas  Supply  Association,  a  trade  asso-
ciation  that  represents  both  major  and  independent  companies  that  produce  and
market natural gas.

In  addition  he  has  served  as  Program  Manager  at  the  EPA’s  Climate  Protection
Division  in  the  Office  of  Air  and  Radiation,  where  he  developed  and  implemented
energy  efficiency  programs  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  hazardous  air

Ms.  WEISSMAN.  Madam  Chairman,  Chairman  Lampson,  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee  and  staff,  I  am  very  encouraged  to  be  here
this morning and I really thank you for the opportunity.

This  is  a  perfect  time  to  be  talking  about  training  and  building
a confident and strong workforce for solar energy. Solar electric in-
stallations  grew  by  over  40  percent  in  2006.  If  we  meet  the  goals
of  the  photovoltaic  industry  roadmap,  direct  employment  will  in-
crease from 20,000 now to 62,000 in 2015. By the U.S. Department
of Energy’s own estimates, as many as 5,000 trained installers may
be  needed  to  accomplish  their  new  Solar  America  Initiative.  Many
recent  and  well-documented  reports  and  research  show  continued
and robust investment and growth for the solar energy market, but
as  the  market  grows,  so  does  the  need  for  quality  and  accessible
training opportunities for these new green collar jobs.

The  good  news  is  that  the  framework  is  in  place  to  give  us  the
tools  we  need  to  develop  a  strong  workforce.  NABCEP,  the  North
American  Board  of  Certified  Energy  Practitioners,  offers  profes-
sional  credentials  for  renewable  energy  installers.  Since  2003,
NABCEP  has  certified  365  solar  electric  installers  from  40  states.
NABCEP  certifications  are  based  on  strict  psychometric  guidelines
and  credentialing  principles.  The  process  is  rigorous  for  the  appli-
cant and requires documenting experience and passing a four-hour
exam.  NABCEP’s  competency  standard  sends  a  clear  message  to
consumers  and  public  officials  that  the  industry  stresses  safe  and
ethical  business  practices  and  high-quality  workmanship  stand-
ards. The bar has been raised for professional services in the solar
industry.

While  NABCEP  certifies  the  installer,  IREC,  the  Interstate  Re-
newable  Energy  Council,  accredits  the  training  programs  and  cer-
tifies the instructors. Credentials are awarded using standards de-
veloped  by  the  Institute  for  Sustainable  Power.  These  standards
ensure  legitimacy  of  what  is  being  taught  and  by  whom.  A  system
of  review  and  audit  provides  a  means  to  compare  content,  quality
and resources across a broad range of training.

We see promising trends for new practitioner programs. Commu-
nity  colleges,  as  my  colleague,  Joe  Sarubbi,  will  talk  about,  and
technical  schools  are  offering  renewable  energy  courses.  These
range  from  stand-alone  courses,  new  energy  certificates  and  asso-
ciate  degree  programs.  Classes  are  expanding  from  three-  to  five-
day workshops to semester-long courses.

The Committee asked me three questions. Question number 1: Is
there  a  sufficient  number  of  people  trained?  As  market  perform-
ance  continues  to  grow,  the  number  of  current  training  opportuni-

ties falls far short of meeting the demand for qualified workers. We
need  more  classroom  and  hands-on  training  tailored  to  meet  local
labor  needs.  Alliances  need  to  be  developed  and  advisory  commit-
tees  established  between  training  centers  and  local  business.  The
curriculum  needs  to  include  real-world  preparation  with  field  and
on-the-roof internships.

Question  2:  Are  such  programs  necessary  or  useful?  The  current
training  programs  are  a  start  at  providing  a  critical  service  that
supports a strong and growing solar industry. However, their reach
is  limited  and  training  opportunities  need  to  be  broadened.  We
must  make  sure  that  training  programs  are  teaching  students  the
right  skills  to  do  a  good  job,  that  the  facilities  include  the  right
equipment  and  hardware,  that  safe  practices  are  utilized  and  that
teachers  are  qualified.  While  many  states  support  workshops  and
training programs, New York provides a national model for us. In-
staller training is a top priority for NYSERDA, the New York State
Energy  Research  and  Development  Authority.  To  date,  NYSERDA
has  invested  nearly  $1  million  to  develop  seven  accredited  solar
training  centers  across  the  state.  NYSERDA’s  program  is  one  to
emulate  and  replicate  as  it  serves  as  a  proven  model  for  future
training programs.

Question  3:  How  can  the  quality  of  training  programs  be  en-
sured?  Training  needs  to  be  based  on  industry  standards  so  that
students  are  taught  the  right  skills  with  the  right  equipment.  We
recommend  the  following.  Training  should  lead  to  defined  work-
place  knowledge,  skills  and  abilities.  Training  should  address
issues  of  safety,  codes  and  core  competencies  of  an  industry-ap-
proved  task  or  job  analysis.  Training  should  be  in  an  environment
with appropriate facilities, tools and safe practices. Training should
offer a formal and planned learning structure where the learner re-
ceives  some  sort  of  feedback  and  their  progress  is  monitored  and
training  programs  and  learning  objectives  should  be  assessed  and
receive independent approval or accreditation.

We  have  the  foundation  in  place  for  training  and  developing  a
strong workforce. NABCEP’s third-party certification programs are
a means for consumers to identify qualified workers. NABCEP has
set  industry  standards  high.  Now  we  need  to  provide  the  training
to meet these standards.

Madam  Chair,  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity.  Members  of  the
Committee,  thank  you,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  ques-
tions.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Weissman follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JANE M. WEISSMAN

Mr.  Chairman,  Representative  Giffords,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank
you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss education and training
programs to facilitate the adoption of solar energy technology.

I  am  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Interstate  Renewable  Energy  Council,  a  non
profit  organization  working  with  state  agencies,  communities  and  industry  across
the  country.  Along  with  technical  assistance,  targeted  outreach,  promoting  uniform
guidelines and standards, and consumer protection, we focus on some of the current
and  often  difficult  issues  facing  expanded  renewable  energy  use  such  as  connecting
small-scale  renewables  to  the  utility  grid  and  developing  quality  assessment  pro-
grams  for  renewable  energy  professionals,  products  and  training  programs.  The
Interstate  Renewable  Energy  Council  offers  third-party  verification  of  training  pro-
grams  and  instructors  using  an  application  and  audit  assessment  process  based  on
standards  developed  by  the  Institute  for  Sustainable  Power  which  is  used  inter-

nationally.  This  framework  of  standards  and  metrics  verify  that  training  programs
and  instructors  have  met  predetermined  and  consistent  criteria.  The  Interstate  Re-
newable Energy Council is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.

I  also  serve  as  the  Vice  Chair  of  the  North  American  Board  of  Certified  Energy
Practitioners,  NABCEP,  a  national,  non  profit  corporation  offering  professional  cre-
dentials for renewable energy installers. NABCEP was started in 2002 with the first
certification  program  for  solar  electric  installers  launched  in  2003.  To  date,  there
are  365  certified  solar  electric  installers  from  40  states.  Both  the  photovoltaic  and
solar  thermal  programs  are  based  on  strict,  psychometric  principles  and
credentialing  guidelines.  It  is  a  rigorous  process  requiring  documentation  of  experi-
ence  and/or  training  and  the  passing  of  a  four-hour  exam.  NABCEP’s  competency
standards  for  certification  sends  a  clear  message  to  consumers  and  public  officials
that  the  Industry  stresses  high  quality,  safe  and  ethical  business  practices  and
workmanship  standards.  The  bar  has  been  raised  for  professional  services  for  the
solar industry.

This  is  a  perfect  time  to  be  talking  about  training  and  building  a  competent  and

strong workforce.

The solar industry reports that solar electric installations grew by over 20 percent
in 2006. If the goals of the Photovoltaic Industry Road Map are met, total installed
capacity  could  increase  to  9,600  MW  by  2015.  Direct  employment  would  increase
from 20,000 now to 62,000 by 2015.1

The  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  estimates  that  as  many  as  5,000  trained  install-

ers may be needed by 2015 to accomplish their new Solar America Initiative.2

A  survey  conducted  by  the  investment  bank  Jefferies  &  Company  in  February
2007  said  that  among  renewable  energy  sources,  solar  power  is  viewed  as  likely  to
contribute most to the world’s primary energy supplies by 2020.3

According  to  a  report  released  in  March  2007  by  Clean  Edge,  global  clean-energy
markets  are  ready  to  quadruple  in  the  next  decade,  growing  from  $55.4  billion  in
revenues in 2006 to more than $226.5 billion by 2016 for four technologies—biofuels,
wind power, solar photovoltaics and the fuel cell and distributed hydrogen market.4
Add  to  these  facts  and  market-based  predictions  rising  retail  electric  grid  prices,
volatile  pump  prices,  climate  change,  the  increasing  value  of  energy  independence,
and new and expanded state and federal policies. All of these influences are result-
ing in new ‘‘green-collar’’ jobs.
Training Trends

Over the years, the renewable energy industry has been fortunate to have a num-
ber  of  training  centers—the  Florida  Solar  Energy  Center,  Solar  Energy  Inter-
national, the Midwest Renewable Energy Association, the North Carolina Solar Cen-
ter  and  the  Great  Lakes  Renewable  Energy  Association.  These  dedicated  programs
have provided us with experienced instructors and well-trained students. But as the
market grows, so does the need for quality and accessible training opportunities.

We are starting to see encouraging trends.5

courses.

• More and more Community Colleges and Technical Schools (high schools and
private)  are  offering  Renewable  Energy  Courses.  These  range  from  stand-
alone  courses,  new  energy  certificates,  associate  degree  programs,  and  cus-
tomized training for business and industry.
• Classes  are  expanding  from  three-  to  five-day  workshops  to  semester-long
• Students range anywhere from 18–45 years of age. They may be existing col-
lege students in energy programs, other technology disciplines, existing trades
people, those looking at changing careers or those who are currently working
in the industry and are upgrading their skills and knowledge.
• Some  Community  Colleges  are  incorporating  renewable  and  alternative  en-
ergy  technology  into  existing  trade  programs  such  as  construction,  electrical,
Heating,  Ventilation  &  Air  Conditioning,  and  industrial  maintenance  trades
programs.

In Eugene, Oregon, Lane Community College Energy Management Program offers
a degree and certificate program with a concentration for Renewable Energy Techni-
cians.6

Cape Cod Community College Construction Technology program was recently relo-
cated  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Environmental/Renewable  Energy  Program.  All  of
the  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  courses  will  be  electives  for  the  Con-
struction Tech program.

The  curriculum  at  two  technical  high  schools  on  Cape  Cod  in  Massachusetts  has
been  developed  so  that  renewable  energy  is  integrated  into  existing  shops  and  aca-
demic areas with articulations at Cape Cod Community College.

In  January  2006,  Austin  Community  College  and  the  Texas  State  Energy  Con-
servation  Office  advertised  the  offering  of  a  48-hour,  14-week  course  in  solar  elec-
tricity. The class at Austin Community College sold out two weeks ahead of the offi-
cial  start  date  prompting  Austin  Community  College  to  offer  a  second  section  for
the 2006 winter semester.

In November 2005, Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, New York opened
its  photovoltaic  laboratory  providing  students  hands-on  experience  installing  photo-
voltaic systems. The courses are included in the college’s Electrical Construction and
Maintenance program curriculum.

Madison Area Technical College’s Consortium for Education in Renewable Energy
Technology  is  a  partnership  among  multiple  institutions  to  share  instructional  re-
sources  and  expertise.  The  curriculum  is  designed  to  supplement  traditional  degree
and apprenticeship programs and serve the needs of workers and employers.

The  Renewable  Energy  Diploma  Series  at  North  Carolina  State  University  is
structured  so  that  intensive  technology  training  covers  not  only  the  technical  as-
pects but also the policy and business parts of the industry.

Through  internship  programs,  students  are  gaining  in-field,  on-the-roof  installa-
tion  experiences  in  New  York  through  the  state  and  industry  mentor/student  pro-
gram.  The  program  is  administered  by  the  New  York  Solar  Energy  Industry  Asso-
ciation  and  supported  by  the  New  York  State  Energy  Research  and  Development
Authority (NYSERDA).

And the National Joint Apprenticeship & Training Program, the training arm for
the  IBEW,  offers  its  members  and  local  unions  quality  training  in  photovoltaics.  In
fact, they just published a text book on Photovoltaic Systems, which is an important
contribution to training around the country.
Question 1. Is there sufficient number of people trained and if not, is there

a sufficient number of training programs?

If  market  past  performance  continues  and  current  projections  are  realized,  these
emerging training opportunities fall far short of expected demand for qualified work-
ers. The Solar Energy Industries Association predicts that direct employment could
increase  from  20,000  now  to  62,000  by  2015.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  esti-
mates that 5,000 trained installers could be needed to meet their goals. To date, we
have just 365 certified solar electric installers and 40 certified solar thermal install-
ers.  While  there  are  more  installers  who  have  not  become  NABCEP-certified,  and
while  some  of  them  hold  licenses  providing  evidence  of  competency,  there  is  still  a
growing demand for trained and qualified workers.

And, even though we are seeing more Community Colleges and other educational
providers  offer  training  programs  and  even  with  distance  learning  and  web-based
instructional opportunities, we need more classroom and hands-on training tailored
to meet local labor needs. We need to see alliances developed and advisory commit-
tees  established  between  training  centers  and  local  business  and  industry.  Cur-
riculum  needs  to  include  real-world  preparation  for  solar  installers  with  field  and
laboratory experiences provided.
Question  2. Are  such  programs  necessary  or  useful  for  prospective  solar

panel installers and consumers?

The programs described above are providing a critical service to support a strong
and growing solar industry. However, their reach is limited and training opportuni-
ties need to be broadened.

As part of the Solar America Initiative (SAI), the DOE Solar Energy Technologies
Program  is  analyzing  the  current  situation  to  identify  needs  for  the  training  and
certification  of  photovoltaic  system  designers  and  installers.  A  task  force  has  been
convened to study and report on these issues.

As training programs are offered by a variety of educational providers, how do po-
tential  students  know  that  they  will  be  taught  the  skills  and  knowledge  they  will
need  to  do  a  good  job?  Do  the  facilities  include  the  right  equipment  and  hardware
for  training?  Are  there  procedures  that  ensure  safety  and  safe  practices?  Are  the
programs  managed  in  a  fiscally  responsible  way?  Are  the  teachers  qualified?  These
are some of the questions that come to mind as more courses are offered and enroll-
ment increases.

While many states support workshops and training programs, New York provides
a national model. Installer training is a top priority for the New York State Energy
Research  and  Development  Authority.  NYSERDA  is  supporting  the  development  of
an  in-state  network  of  training  programs  to  provide  accessible  and  quality  instruc-
tional  opportunities  for  those  already  in  the  renewable  energy  trades  or  for  those
who  are  planning  to  enter  the  profession.  To  date,  NYSERDA  has  invested  nearly
$1,000,000 in developing seven accredited solar training centers and continuing edu-
cation programs across the state, partnering with SUNY Delhi, SUNY Farmingdale,
the Ulster County Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), Alfred Uni-
versity,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College,  the  City  University  of  New  York  and
local Joint Apprenticeship & Training Committees/IBEW.

The  NYSERDA  program  is  one  to  emulate  and  replicate  as  it  serves  as  a  proven

model for future training programs.
Question 3. How can the quality of training programs be ensured?

Training needs to be based on industry standards so that students are taught the

right skills with the right equipment.

The  Interstate  Renewable  Energy  Council,  with  input  from  industry  and  edu-
cation  subject  matter  experts,  recommends  the  following  guidelines  for  practitioner
training:

• Training should be designed to provide educational, training, and skill devel-
opment  experiences  that  lead  to  defined  workplace  knowledge,  skills,  and
abilities.

• Training should appropriately addresses issues of safety, codes, and core com-

petencies of an industry-approved task or job analysis.

safe practices as well as administrative and managerial quality.

• Training should be taught in an atmosphere with appropriate facilities, tools,
• Training  should  offer  a  formal  and  planned  learning  structure  where  the
learner receives some sort of feedback and the learner’s progress is monitored.
• Training should be taught under the administration of a legally registered en-
• Training  programs  and  learning  objectives  should  be  assessed  and  receive

tity.

independent approval or accreditation.

Closing Remarks

The  foundation  is  in  place  for  training  and  developing  a  strong  workforce.
NABCEP’s  third-party  verification  and  certification  programs  result  in  a  means  for
consumers  to  identify  qualified  installers  and  encourage  the  development  of  a  well-
qualified  workforce.  NABCEP  has  set  industry  standards  high. . .now  we  need  to
provide the training to meet these standards.

Mr. Chairman, Representative Giffords and Members of the Committee, this con-

cludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to take any questions.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JOSEPH  T.  SARUBBI,  PROFESSOR/DE-
PARTMENT  CHAIR,  BUILDING  SYSTEMS  TECHNOLOGY  DE-
PARTMENT, HUDSON VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE
Mr.  SARUBBI.  Thank  you.  Madam  Chair,  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee, it is certainly an honor and a pleasure for me to appear be-
fore you today to discuss the value of training programs for the in-
stallation  and  maintenance  of  photovoltaic  systems.  I  truly  believe
the  timing  is  right  for  our  country  to  invest  in  renewable  energy
technologies.  We  are  witnessing  a  renaissance  in  thinking  about

the  way  we  generate  and  use  energy  in  America  and  solar  power
is a key component of this new mindset.

As  we  continue  to  embrace  solar  power,  we  need  a  well-training
workforce  to  be  responsive  to  this  fast-growing  industry  to  ensure
success  and  our  country  has  the  educational  infrastructure  at  the
post-secondary level capable of creating a skilled workforce in pho-
tovoltaic installation and maintenance.

At the forefront of this training are community colleges. With the
right  resources,  I  have  witnessed  firsthand  the  ability  of  commu-
nity  colleges  to  quickly  take  action  and  develop  credit  and  non-
credit courses, certificate programs as well as associate’s degrees to
develop  a  skilled  workforce  in  myriad  occupations.  Hudson  Valley
Community College can certainly be viewed as a case study for de-
veloping  a  successful  solar  energy  training  program.  We  have
gained  national  and  international  recognition  for  our  PV  installers
programs  and  our  training  facilities.  Our  success  was  based  on
three  variables.  First,  a  government  agency  such  as  the  New  York
State  Research  and  Development  Authority,  who  provided  the
funding stream through grant opportunities as well as tremendous
guidance  to  help  ensure  success  along  with  other  organizations
such  as  the  Interstate  Renewable  Energy  Council  and  the  North
American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners, who are guiding
us  toward  accreditation.  The  second  variable  is  collaborating  with
the  local  certified  PV  companies  with  the  expertise  to  recommend
the  best  equipment  for  training,  advice  on  curriculum  and  on-the-
job  training  for  our  students,  and  third,  well-trained  faculty  to  de-
liver high-quality education.

Now, we weren’t sure what was going to happen when we started
this process but to steal the baseball analogy, build it and they will
come, certainly held true for our solar training programs. Once the
word  got  out,  interest  came  quickly  and  is  growing  fast  in  many
ways.  From  PV  companies  expressing  interest  in  hiring  our  stu-
dents,  from  individuals  interested  in  gaining  the  solar  training,
from  homeowners  seeking  information  about  having  solar  systems
installed,  and  from  other  schools  interested  in  learning  from  our
success, there has been tremendous synergy surrounding the devel-
opment of our solar training program, so much so that Hudson Val-
ley Community College hosted the first-ever national conference for
educators and trainers on renewable energy training and energy ef-
ficiency  workforce  education,  and  that  happened  last  November
with educators and school administrators from other 30 states and
six  countries.  We  had  somebody  come  from  Australia  who  was  in-
terested  in  seeing  what  we  were  doing.  It  was  tremendously  suc-
cessful and we are hosting a second conference in March 2008, and
I  share  that  because  great  things  have  come  out  of  us  starting  a
training program in the solar industry. Members of the community
now have another career path. Solar companies are happy because
they  can  expand  their  services  as  more  and  more  homeowners
clamor  for  solar  power,  all  leading  to  job  growth  and  economic  de-
velopment.  Furthermore,  our  success  has  opened  the  door  to  de-
velop  wonderful  partnerships  with  local  solar  installation  compa-
nies  as  well  as  large  solar  manufacturing  companies  such  as  Sun
Power,  who  uses  our  facilities  for  training,  and  they  are  a  Cali-

fornia-based  company  and  they  come  to  Troy,  New  York,  to  utilize
our facilities.

In closing, I can’t emphasize enough the importance of solar—you
know,  certified  solar  training  programs  in  ensuring  the  continued
growth of the solar industry. It is a critical cog in the wheel of suc-
cess. Without sound training programs, that wheel might keep roll-
ing  for  a  while  but  it  will  break  down.  I  ask  the  Members  of  this
Committee  to  please  consider  supporting  this  exciting  bill  and
thank you for giving me the opportunity to present my thoughts on
this, and I will certainly entertain questions afterwards.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPH T. SARUBBI

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it’s  an  honor  and  a  pleasure  for  me
to appear before you today to discuss the value of training programs for the installa-
tion and maintenance of photovoltaic systems.

The timing is right for our country to invest in renewable energy technologies and
develop  a  workforce  that  will  meet  the  demands  of  the  ever-growing  solar  energy
industry.  We  are  witnessing  a  renaissance  in  thinking  about  the  way  we  generate
and use energy in America and solar power is a key component of this new mindset.
In  fact,  there  is  a  real  grassroots  effort  to  increase  the  use  of  ‘‘green’’  energy  tech-
nology  and  its  time  for  a  national  policy  to  keep  this  momentum.  Moreover,  our
country has the educational infrastructure at the post-secondary level to respond to
the challenges of creating a skilled workforce in photovoltaic (PV) installation. What
we  need  is  a  comprehensive  national  plan  for  training  that  will  help  spur  further
development and interest in solar energy.

At the forefront of training a workforce to meet the needs of this emerging indus-
try  are  community  colleges.  While  most  four-year  institutions  gain  notoriety  for  re-
search  and  development,  it’s  community  colleges  that  are,  and  will  continue  to  be,
responsive  to  national,  state  and  local  initiatives  that  drive  the  development  of
training programs. With the right resources, I’ve witnessed first-hand the ability of
community colleges to quickly take action and develop credit and non-credit courses,
certificate programs, and new associate’s degrees that act as a catalyst for economic
growth  by  providing  skilled  workforces.  For  example,  Hudson  Valley  Community
College is a comprehensive institution that serves the greater Capital Region of up-
state New York. With more than 70 degree and certificate programs and more than
12,000  students,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  has  positioned  itself  as  a  true
partner with businesses and government agencies in the region and across the state.
The  college  has  received  national  and  international  recognition  for  its  world-class
technologies programs, and its photovoltaic training program is no exception.

At  the  forefront  of  the  college’s  success  with  solar  energy  training,  are  the  part-
nerships  forged  with  government  agencies  such  as  the  New  York  State  Research
and Development Authority (NYSERDA), which offers numerous grant opportunities
in  renewable  energy  technology  training.  In  fact,  NYSERDA’s  funding  program  for
the  development  of  photovoltaic  installers  was  the  catalyst  and  mechanism  that  al-
lowed  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  to  invest  in  PV  training.  By  reaching  out
to  local  PV  Companies,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  was  able  to  tap  into  ex-
perts in the field who are Certified PV installers as recognized by the North Amer-
ican Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). With their help, as well as
assistance  from  NYSERDA,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  was  able  to  create,
in a rather short period of time, a nationally recognized facility to train PV install-
ers  (see  exhibits  1–3).  The  college  developed  credited  PV  courses  to  augment  its
Electrical  Construction  and  Maintenance  Associate’s  Degree  program,  as  well  as  a
State  University  of  New  York  (SUNY)  approved  Photovoltaic  Installers  Certificate
Program.  In  addition,  through  the  college’s  Workforce  Development  Institute,  nu-
merous  non-credit  PV  installer  training  programs  have  been  developed  and  are  of-
fered on an on-going basis.
Demand for Solar Energy Training

This  collaborative  effort  between  government,  education  and  business  has  gen-
erated  significant  interest  and  demand  throughout  New  York  State  and  the  entire
northeast.  The  perfect  analogy  to  this  venture:  ‘‘build  it  and  they  will  come’’  could
not  be  anymore  true.  The  college  was  cautious  in  its  approach  to  the  number  of
skilled  PV  workers  it  planned  on  training,  not  yet  understanding  the  market  de-
mands.  Today,  it’s  safe  to  say  that  the  college  underestimated  the  public  interest

and  PV  company  needs  as  the  solar  industry  has  witnessed  exponential  growth  in
the number of installations of the past few years. For example, in 2003, NYSERDA
received  80  applications  for  funding  assistance  of  solar  installations.  By  2006  that
number  grew  to  286  applications,  and  2007  is  on  pace  to  well  exceed  400  applica-
tions (source: NYSERDA). Other agencies such as Long Island Power Authority ob-
served similar growth. Ever since Hudson Valley Community College began to show-
case its photovoltaic program and corresponding facilities, interest has grown at the
same  rate.  I  receive  inquiries  from  individuals  seeking  to  obtain  photovoltaic  skills
via  e-mail  and  phone  on  a  regular  basis.  During  the  past  year,  five  (5)  companies
from  throughout  the  region  have  inquired  about  the  availability  of  PV  students  for
employment.  One  local  certified  photovoltaic  installation  company  started  its  busi-
ness in 2004 and had $80,000 in sales. In 2005 the company increased its sales rev-
enue to $300,000 and by the end of 2006 it reached $1.2 million. This same company
has  a  sales  revenue  projection  for  2007  that  will  exceed  $2.4  million.  Another  PV
company  stated  that  they  need  to  hire  three  (3)  installers  for  every  $1  million  in-
crease  in  PV  sales  procured.  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  is  witnessing  this
growth  first  hand  and  is  positioning  itself  to  meet  the  increase  demand  for  install-
ers.
Students Finding Jobs in the Solar Industry

As  I  stated  earlier,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  was  originally  unsure  of
the potential growth of the photovoltaic industry and decided to move cautiously to-
wards training a workforce that exceeded demand. Our strategy was to supplement
an  already  popular  and  successful  Electrical  Construction  and  Maintenance  associ-
ate’s  degree  program  by  introducing  photovoltaic  courses  as  an  additional  load  to
students’ schedules. The college limited the number of students who could enter the
‘‘PV  Program’’  to  eight  to  12  students  a  year.  The  college  just  completed  its  second
year of training. Of the eighteen (18) students who completed the PV program four
(4)  chose  to  immediately  enter  the  PV  field  while  the  others  sought  employment
with  the  myriad  opportunities  in  the  electrical  industry  that  each  student  is  af-
forded  upon  graduation,  such  as  electricians,  electronic  technicians,  electric  line
workers, electrical estimators, assistant project designers, etc. This spring, one par-
ticular PV company alone sought to hire four installers and two designers, but they
inquired  too  late  to  capture  a  good  portion  of  our  electrical  students  who  had  the
PV installation skills, as many already secured employment in other areas. The col-
lege  is  starting  its  PV  Installers  Certificate  program  this  fall  and  is  currently  ac-
cepting  applications  of  students  for  the  one-year  program.  This  certificate  program,
coupled with our Workforce Development Institute non-credit PV training programs,
should help reduce the current shortage of trained PV installers.
Involvement of Local Business and the State of New York in Building Cur-

riculum

The success of Hudson Valley Community College’s PV training programs and the
development  of  its  photovoltaic  laboratory  wouldn’t  be  possible  without  the  funding
initiatives and guidance provided by NYSERDA, as well as the expertise offered by
local PV companies. Both were instrumental and paramount to the advancement of
a  first-class  training  program.  In  addition  to  the  excellent  laboratory  facilities,
which  were  funded  through  a  NYSERDA  grant,  our  partnership  with  a  local  PV
company created the opportunity for students to work out in the field on actual resi-
dential  installations  thereby  augmenting  their  training  skills  (see  exhibits  4  &  5).
Such  a  relationship  has  helped  ensure  that  our  students  enjoy  high  passage  rates
for  the  North  American  Board  of  Certified  Energy  Practitioners  Photovoltaic  Entry
Level  Certificate  of  Knowledge.  Furthermore,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  is
currently working with the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) as it posi-
tions  itself  to  become  a  national  accredited  training  institution  as  well  as  offering
accredited  training  programs.  The  college  expects  to  be  accredited  near  the  end  of
the year.

Yet  it’s  the  local  and  state  partnerships  that  allowed  Hudson  Valley  Community
College  to  be  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  community.  Through  NYSERDA’s  net-
working  Hudson  Valley  was  able  to  forge  a  solid  partnership  with  California-based
SunPower Corporation. SunPower, seeking an East Coast presence for their growing
business,  donated  equipment  for  the  faculty  and  students  of  the  College  to  utilize
in exchange for SunPower’s use of our photovoltaic laboratory at intermittent times
throughout  the  year  (see  exhibits  6–8).  This  relationship  gave  our  students  greater
exposure  to  more  types  of  photovoltaic  equipment  and  practices.  SunPower  has  en-
joyed their relationship with the college and is currently seeking additional avenues
of  training  with  Hudson  Valley.  Moreover,  other  types  of  training  associated  with
photovoltaic  installations  have  emerged  that  is  equally  important  to  the  success  of

solar  technologies.  Local  building  inspector  training  as  well  as  augmented  training
on  electrical  codes  will  ensure  quality  installations.  When  New  York  State,  edu-
cational institutions and businesses are all invested in developing beneficial training
programs  such  as  photovoltaic  installation,  then  the  link  between  job  growth  and
economic development becomes transparent.

Photovoltaic training programs, much like other technology training programs are
expensive by nature. Yet, if done right, the high academic quality of such programs
becomes apparent and is usually successful in fulfilling its mission. Community col-
leges  are  the  best  fit  to  offer  such  training  programs,  but  because  of  the  shear  na-
ture  of  funding  community  colleges  need  financial  assistance  to  develop  first  class
training  programs.  Continued  partnering  with  government  agencies  and  businesses
that  have  a  vested  interest  in  such  programs  could  help  build  a  national  program
that will facilitate the adoption of solar technology.

STATEMENT OF DR. DANIEL E. ARVIZU, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL
RENEWABLE  ENERGY  LABORATORY,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF
ENERGY
Dr. ARVIZU. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Members
of  the  Committee,  for  this  opportunity  to  discuss  important  issues
related  to  the  Nation’s  energy  policies  to  meet  our  future  energy
needs. I am the director of the National Renewable Energy Labora-
tory  in  Golden,  Colorado,  and  NREL,  as  we  call  it,  is  the  U.S.  De-
partment  of  Energy’s  primary  laboratory  for  research  and  develop-
ment  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  technologies.  I  am
honored to be here to speak with you today. I might note, as I pref-
ace my remarks, that I started in the solar business more than 30
years ago as a young engineer working on solar power towers, con-
centrating  solar  power  at  Sandia  National  Laboratories,  and  we
have come a long way in that time.

I  applaud  the  Committee  for  its  continuing  examination  of  solar
and  other  resources  of  renewable  electricity  and  fuels.  If  we  are  to
ensure  the  Nation  receives  the  full  range  of  benefits  from  renew-
able  energy  technologies,  we  need  to  carefully  balance  and  blend
new  technology,  market  acceptance  and  government  policies.  It  is
not  a  question  of  whether  to  rely  on  the  market,  on  the  research
or on the government action. As we work together, we need to solve
our  energy  problems  by  deploying  all  of  these  things  simulta-
neously. DOE’s Solar Energy Research Program supports the devel-
opment  and  deployment  of  solar  energy  technologies  and  systems
that can help meet our nation’s electricity needs and reduce stress
on  our  electricity  infrastructure.  The  solar  program  supports  re-
search at NREL as well as other institutions in photovoltaics, con-
centrating  solar  power,  solar  heating  and  lighting.  Through  the
President’s  Solar  America  Initiative,  the  SAI,  the  Nation’s  goal  is
to reduce the cost of solar photovoltaic technologies so they become
cost-competitive and effective with other sources of electricity in all
major  U.S.  markets  by  the  year  2015.  Although  the  bulk  of  the
U.S.  national  program  is  focused  on  photovoltaics,  I  will  focus  my
remarks today, oral remarks, that is, on concentrating solar power,
CSP, since that is really the topic of the discussion draft. It is pri-
marily addressing where CSP fits into the overall portfolio.

Recent  developments  in  the  western  U.S.  illustrate  the  growing
concern  over  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  consequently  a  market  cli-
mate is opening up that is furthering the encouragement to deploy
concentrating  solar  power  certainly  in  the  U.S.  Southwest.  In  the
United States, nine CSP power plants totaling 354 megawatts have
been  operating  reliably  in  California  for  the  past  16  years  and
there  seems  to  be—we  seem  to  be  poised  for  some  growth.  These
plants  are  especially  interesting  because  with  the  addition  of  ther-
mal  storage,  they  are  ideally  suited  to  meet  peak  demands  of  en-
ergy use in the Southwest. Until recently, however, this CSP tech-
nology has been stagnant, and as with all new energy technologies,
cost  is  the  issue.  CSP  has  had  additional  challenges  in  that  this
technology  requires  scale  to  achieve  its  ultimate  cost-effectiveness.
Couple the scale issue with high upfront capital costs and what you
have  is  a  pretty  high  investment  risk  that  really  is  difficult  in  the
traditional marketplace. In 2003, the solar program at the Depart-
ment  of  Energy  addressed  cost  by  commissioning  a  detailed  tech-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

nical analysis of what this technology could produce, and it was re-
viewed subsequently by the National Academies and I participated
on  that  panel.  The  cost  of  CSP  at  that  point  was  concluded  that
even  though  at  that  time  it  was  around  12  to  14  cents  a  kilowatt-
hour, that it could ultimately be down in the six to five cents a kil-
owatt-hour,  and  we  believe  that  today  even  though  costs  could  be
exceeded.

The  discussion  draft  language  on  thermal  energy  storage  ad-
dresses  an  important  issue  related  to  the  intermittent  nature  of
solar  energy  and  its  impact  on  utilities  and  the  potential  for  low-
cost  and  efficient  thermal  storage  is  one  of  the  key  long-term  at-
tributes  of  large-scale  CSP  technologies.  The  ability  of  CSP  tech-
nologies  to  store  energy  presents  an  opportunity  for  DOE  and
NREL to establish an R&D effort that focuses on solar technologies
that can produce baseload power at five cents a kilowatt-hour, and
these  systems  could  include  storage  of  up  to  17  hours  that  would
compete  for  firm  power  from  coal  power  plants,  especially  when
they are outfitted with carbon sequestration technology. So it is ex-
pected  that  an  aggressive  R&D  program  could  achieve  these  cost
goals by the year 2020.

The discussion draft also addresses transmission integration, and
an  important  issue  for  CSP  is  that  CSP  is  best  when  the  sun  is
most  intense  and  you  have  cloudless  days,  as  we  do  in  the  sunny
Southwest.  So  plants  are  often  located  in  desert  or  semi-arid  loca-
tions  where  very  few  people  live.  Transmission  lines  are  required
to  bring  that  power  from  remote  locations  to  the  urban  load  cen-
ters. Throughout the West, access to transmission is generally lim-
ited  because  many  lines  operate  at  or  near  capacity.  While  trans-
mission  is  a  problem,  it  is  particularly  difficult  for  solar  because
solar  power  plants  need  to  be  located  where  the  solar  resource  is
and  they  do  not  always  have  close  access  to  existing  transmission
lines. Additional transmission lines would allow solar energies from
the  Southwest  to  provide  a  very  significant  fraction  of  the  overall
total  electricity  needs  of  the  country.  So  early  market  penetration
of CSP could be driven by long-term extension of 30 percent invest-
ment  tax  credits  for  commercial  solar  technologies,  but  if  the  cost
of  CSP  power  is  too  high  when  the  tax  credits  expire,  the  market
will be significantly impacted because there will be a downtown in
that technology. An objective of our program is to see that the De-
partment of Energy’s CSP R&D activities would be to decrease the
cost  of  the  technology  in  a  timely  fashion  so  the  market  remains
healthy when tax credits might expire.

The  Solar  America  Initiative  of  the  Department  has  doubled  the
effort  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of  photovoltaics  in  the  market-
place  and  earlier  this  year  12  technology  pathway  partnership
projects  were  selected  to  receive  up  to  $168  million  over  the  next
three  years  and  the  awardees  contributing  over  50  percent  of  the
funding.  The  new  portfolio  continues  our  historic  investment  in
thin  films  and  increases  support  significantly  for  concentrating
photovoltaics and silicon technologies.

In  summary,  to  address  our  near-term  needs  in  solar  power,  we
need a national strategy that promotes deployment of solar systems
and  processes  that  are  ready  to  serve  us  today.  At  the  same  time,
to  address  our  longer-term  needs  and  achieve  a  truly  significant

contribution  from  solar  power  technologies,  we  must  make  a  new
major commitment to the research required to deliver the next and
subsequent  generations  of  concentrating  solar  power,  photovoltaics
and  other  new  technologies.  We  also  need  to  invest  in  the  infra-
structure  and  in  the  workforce  required  to  promote  sustainable
businesses  and  job  creation.  The  good  news  is  that  the  U.S.  can
take back the global leadership that it once had in the solar energy
field. What is likely to be one of the most important new industries
of the century is solar energy through investing wisely now and in
the  future.  The  timing  is  fortuitous  because  by  most  accounts,  the
next  big  major  market  for  global  renewable  energy  use  is  here  in
the United States.

I would be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DANIEL E. ARVIZU

Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to discuss important issues related
to the Nation’s energy policies to meet our energy demands for the future. I am the
director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado.
NREL  is  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s  primary  laboratory  for  research  and  de-

ment  policies.  It  is  not  a  question  of  whether  to  rely  solely  on  the  market,  or  on
new  research,  or  on  government  action,  as  we  work  to  solve  our  energy  problems.
To  accelerate  deployment  of  renewable  energy  technologies,  we  need  to  effectively
combine all three.

It’s  also  crucial  that  this  mix  of  technology,  markets  and  policies  be  crafted  so
that  each  works  in  conjunction  with  the  others.  The  reality  is  that  distinct  renew-
able  energy  technologies—be  they  solar  photovoltaic,  solar  thermal,  wind,  biomass
power,  biofuels  or  geothermal—are  in  different  places  in  terms  of  their  economics,
technological  maturity  and  market  acceptance.  While  a  broad  range  of  policies  are
needed  to  spur  on  these  varied  technologies,  the  specifics  of  policies  and  incentives
to  be  enacted  ideally  must  be  tailored  to  fit  the  unique  requirements  of  each  of  the
systems and devices we are seeking to deploy.

My  testimony  will  address  the  Committee’s  Solar  Discussion  Draft,  share  with
you  related  activities  underway  in  the  Solar  Energy  Program  of  the  Department  of
Energy’s  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  and  provide  some  spe-
cific  reactions  to  the  draft  from  our  laboratory’s  perspective.  I  should  note  that  on
behalf  of  DOE,  the  Administration  has  not  had  sufficient  time  to  coordinate  inter-
agency  views  on  the  Discussion  Draft,  but  the  Department  wants  to  provide  some
preliminary comments.
SOLAR  POWER:  CURRENT  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM
AND  POTENTIAL  CONTRIBUTION  TO  THE  NATION’S  ENERGY
PORTFOLIO

DOE’s Solar Energy Program sponsors research, development, and deployment of
solar  energy  technologies  and  systems  that  can  help  meet  our  nation’s  electricity
needs  and  reduce  stress  on  our  electricity  infrastructure.  The  Solar  Program  sup-
ports  research  in  photovoltaics  (PV),  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP),  and  solar
heating  and  lighting.  Through  the  President’s  Solar  America  Initiative  (SAI),  a
major  effort  within  his  Advanced  Energy  Initiative,  the  Solar  Energy  Program  goal
is to reduce the cost of solar photovoltaic technologies so that they become cost-com-
petitive with other sources of electricity in all major U.S. markets by 2015.

The SAI is being implemented at a critical time in the evolution of the global solar
market.  Worldwide  growth  rates  for  photovoltaics  have  averaged  well  over  35  per-
cent  for  the  last  five  years,  which  means  the  amount  of  installed  solar  power  dou-
bles every four years or less. However, this rapid growth is from a very small base;
PV still accounts for less than one percent of electricity generation worldwide. Pres-
ently,  several  nations—including  China,  Germany,  India,  Japan,  South  Korea,  and
Taiwan—are attempting to attain larger shares of the global photovoltaic market by

making  significant  public  investments  to  spur  private  industry.  At  the  same  time,
technology improvements and State incentives are stimulating domestic demand for
photovoltaic  systems  in  the  U.S.  The  Solar  America  Initiative  will  provide  the  in-
vestment  needed  to  expand  U.S.  advantages  in  product  design  and  manufacturing,
assuring that American technologies play a leading role in the growing domestic and
global markets for solar electricity.

The  SAI  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  focus  our  efforts  on  accelerating  cost
reductions and manufacturing scale-up of the domestic photovoltaic industry to cap-
italize on this opportunity. As we work to increase our energy independence and re-
duce  our  impact  on  environmental  resources,  solar  technologies  offer  an  attractive
carbon-free, pollution-free energy resource.

In Fiscal Year 2007, President Bush requested $148 million for SAI—a 78 percent
increase  over  pre-initiative  levels—and  the  significant  Fiscal  Year  2007  Congres-
sional  appropriation  demonstrated  that  our  nation’s  leaders  are  in  agreement  that
developing  cost-competitive  solar  technologies  is  an  important  priority.  The  SAI
R&D efforts supported by this funding are expected to expand domestic installed PV
generating  capacity  up  to  10  GW  by  2015.  Beyond  enabling  increases  in  manufac-
turing capacity, these projects will help put U.S. industry on track to reduce the cost
of  electricity  produced  by  PV—from  current  levels  of  $0.18—$0.23  per  kWh  to
$0.05—$0.10  per  kWh  by  2015—a  price  that  is  competitive  in  markets  nationwide.
STATUS OF CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER (CSP) MARKETS

Recent developments in the western United States illustrate the growing concern
over  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  consequently,  a  market  climate  that  is  open  to
further deployment of concentrating solar power (CSP) in that region of the country.
In  September  2006,  California  enacted  the  California  Global  Warming  Solutions
Act  of  2006,  which  requires  the  state  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25
percent by 2020.1 In March 2007, California and four other western states (Arizona,
New Mexico, Oregon, Washington) announced the Western Regional Climate Action
Initiative2 in which they agreed to work together to cut their states’ greenhouse gas
emissions. With the large solar resources available in the Southwest, CSP-generated
electricity could play an important role in helping these states meet their emissions
reduction  goals.  In  the  longer-term,  CSP-generated  electricity  could  help  all  the
states reduce their greenhouse emissions.

Solar  energy  is  the  southwest’s  most  abundant  renewable  resource.  In  fact,  Cali-
fornia,  Arizona,  and  New  Mexico  have  enough  combined  solar  energy  to  provide  all
the power needed by the entire country. CSP technology is the least expensive solar
technology for providing large quantities of electrical power, and with sufficient stor-
age,  it  can  deliver  baseload  power.  At  a  time  when  large  quantities  of  carbon-free
power  will  be  needed;  CSP  power  plants,  constructed  primarily  of  concrete,  glass,
and steel, can be quickly constructed and brought on line. The yearly CO2 emissions
from a 1,000 MW coal plant are approximately 2,300,000 tons. The yearly CO2 emis-
sions  from  a  1,000  MW  CSP  plant  would  be  nearly  zero  (there  may  be  some  need
for  grid  power  during  the  operation  of  the  plant).  With  access  to  adequate  trans-
mission,  CSP  could  even  provide  inexpensive  carbon-free  electricity  beyond  the
Southwest to other regions of the U.S.

In the U.S., nine CSP power plants totaling 354 MW have been operating reliably
in  California  for  over  16  years,  and  CSP  seems  poised  to  grow  significantly  in  the
state.  Each  of  the  three  major  California  utilities  (Southern  California  Edison,  San
Diego  Gas  and  Electric,  and  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric)  have  signed  power  purchase
agreements  for  a  CSP  project  or  have  indicated  an  intent  of  doing  so.  In  August
2005, Southern California Edison (SCE) signed a power purchase agreement for 500
MW  of  CSP  dish-engine  systems  on  a  4,500  acre  site  near  Victorville,  CA,  with  an
option to expand the project to 850 MW. In September 2005, San Diego Gas & Elec-
tric (SDG&E) signed a power purchase agreement for a 300 MW dish-engine project
in California’s Imperial Valley, with an option of expanding the project to 900 MW.3
In  August  2006,  the  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company  initiated  plans  with  Luz  II,
LLC, to purchase at least 500 MW of solar energy beginning in the spring of 2010.4
The  State  of  Nevada  has  put  in  place  tax  credits  enabling  the  construction  of  a
64  MW  CSP  project  near  Las  Vegas  that  recently  came  on  line.  Nevada  Power  will
purchase  the  power  from  the  plant.  A  one  MW  CSP  system,  completed  in  2006,  is

operating  in  Arizona  for  Arizona  Public  Service.  In  addition,  several  other  utilities,
under  the  leadership  of  Arizona  Public  Service,  are  investigating  the  potential  of
forming a consortium that would buy power from a 250 MW CSP plant built in Ari-
zona.

The  southwestern  states  also  have  strong  renewable  portfolio  standards  (RPS)
which  require  that  a  specific  portion  of  a  state’s  electricity  consumption  be  met  by
renewable  energy  by  a  certain  year.  RPS’  are  chief  among  the  state  policies  that
promote  renewable  energy,  and  some  even  specify  that  a  certain  amount  of  power
must come from solar energy.
CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER TECHNOLOGY STATUS

As  with  all  new  energy  technologies,  cost  is  an  issue.  But  CSP  has  an  additional
challenge:  the  technology  requires  scale  to  achieve  its  ultimate  cost  effectiveness.
Couple  the  scale  issue  with  high  up-front  capital  costs  and  the  investment  risk  is
too large for current market conditions.

The Solar Program addressed the cost issue by commissioning a detailed technical
analysis  of  CSP  by  an  independent  engineering  firm  and  then  having  the  analysis
reviewed by the National Research Council. Sargent and Lundy (S&L) was selected
to conduct this analysis on the basis, among other factors, of its independence from
the  CSP  industry  and  its  recognized  performance  in  conducting  due  diligence  stud-
ies for the fossil power industry. S&L estimated that the cost of CSP technology can
be significantly reduced from 12–14 cents/kWh (as of 2003). Sargent & Lundey pre-
dicts projects ultimate costs for CSP troughs at 6.2 cents/kWh and power towers at
5.5 cents/kWh. Sandia and NREL (Sunlab) predict costs could be even lower.

Since  the  S&L  report  was  completed  in  2003,  the  experience  gained  from  trough
plants  being  built  in  the  U.S.  and  Spain  is  enabling  industry  to  lower  their  cost
through mass production and building larger plants. Since the S&L report was writ-
ten,  the  price  of  steel,  concrete,  copper,  and  other  commodity  materials  have  risen.
Although the numbers, as of 2007, are low, the figure continues to show the poten-
tial for CSP cost reduction.

Because sunshine is most intense during the hot summer months when air condi-
tioners  are  working  the  hardest,  solar  energy  is  a  good  match  for  a  utility’s  peak
load.  With  3–5  hrs.  of  storage,  CSP  is  also  a  good  match  to  a  utility’s  intermediate
load. After gaining market penetration within the intermediate and peak load mar-
kets, however, CSP could expand into baseload generation markets through the ex-
panded  use  of  thermal  storage,  thereby  providing  a  renewable  alternative  to  base-
load  coal  power.  CSP  technologies  convert  solar  energy  into  thermal  energy  which
is  then  stored  in  large  tanks.  This  is  an  efficient  way  of  keeping  the  energy  until
it’s  needed,  at  which  time  the  hot  fluid,  often  a  molten  salt  mixture,  is  pumped  to
a power block where it is converted to electrical power through a turbine.
The Role of Thermal Energy Storage and Transmission Integration

The Discussion Draft language on thermal energy storage addresses an important
issue  related  to  the  intermittent  nature  of  solar  energy  and  its  impact  on  utilities.
Adding thermal storage to concentrating solar power (CSP) plants enables solar en-
ergy  to  be  provided  any  time,  day  or  night,  that  power  is  needed.  Thermal  storage
also has the potential for being low cost. An independent study by Sargent & Lundy
concluded  that  CSP  costs  could  be  reduced  to  between  4.3  and  6.2  cents/kWh  by
2020 for technology that utilizes thermal energy storage.5

The potential for low-cost and efficient thermal storage is one of the key long-term
attributes  of  large-scale  CSP  technologies.  Key  advantages  of  thermal  energy  stor-
age are:

• High  Value  Dispatch  of  Electricity:  Without  thermal  energy  storage,  solar
power  is  an  intermittent  power  resource,  dependent  on  when  the  sunshine.
Thermal  energy  storage  allows  the  collection  of  solar  energy  to  be  separated
from the generation of electric power, providing the ability to dispatch genera-
tion when the value for electricity is highest.
• Firming  Delivery  for  Solar  Power:  The  ability  to  store  energy  and  dispatch
solar power when it is needed helps make solar power plants a more reliable
or firm power resource for the utility. Firming of delivery is an important as-
pect  of  supporting  the  economics  of  solar  power  plants  through  utility  capac-
ity payments.
• Increasing the Annual Capacity Factor: Solar power generating systems with-
out  thermal  storage  achieve  capacity  factors  in  the  range  of  25–30  percent.

With  the  addition  of  advanced,  low-cost  thermal  energy  storage,  systems  can
be  economically  sized  to  allow  capacity  factors  of  75  percent  or  higher.  As  a
result,  with  the  addition  of  thermal  energy  storage  it  is  possible  for  solar
power plants to operate at or near baseload conditions.

The  ability  of  CSP  technologies  to  store  energy  presents  an  opportunity  for  DOE
to establish an R&D effort that focuses on a solar technology that can produce base-
load power at about five cents/kWh. Such systems would include 13–17 hrs. of ther-
mal storage and would compete with the cost of power from coal plants using carbon
sequestration  technology.  It  is  expected  that  an  aggressive  R&D  program  could
achieve the cost goal by 2020.

The Discussion Draft also addresses transmission integration, an important issue
for  CSP  plants.  CSP  works  best  where  the  sun  is  most  intense  and  there  are  few
cloudy  days,  so  plants  are  often  located  in  desert  or  semi-arid  locations  where  few
people  live.  Transmission  lines  are  required  to  bring  the  power  from  these  remote
locations to urban load centers. Throughout the West, access to transmission is gen-
erally limited because many lines currently operate at or near capacity. While trans-
mission  is  a  problem  for  all  new  power  generation,  it  is  particularly  difficult  for
solar because solar power plants need to be located where the solar resource is best
and  these  are  not  always  near  existing  transmission  lines.  Addition  transmission
lines could allow solar energy from the Southwest to provide up to 6,800 GW of elec-
tricity to the U.S.
POTENTIAL R&D AND MARKET STRATEGY FOR CSP TECHNOLOGY

During  the  last  three  years,  representatives  of  the  DOE  and  NREL  solar  pro-
grams  have  met  with  the  energy  and  economic  advisors  to  governors,  energy  regu-
lators, state legislators, utilities, and other stakeholders in California, Nevada, Ari-
zona, and New Mexico. These meetings were to provide the states the economic, en-
vironmental,  and  energy  benefits  of  CSP.  Each  state  expressed  an  interest  in  CSP,
although their interest was tempered by the high cost of the technology. They were,
however,  encouraged  by  the  Program’s  projections  of  significant  cost  reduction  and
also  showed  interest  in  finding  ways  to  encourage  the  deployment  of  CSP  in  their
states.  Nevada  subsequently  implemented  tax  incentives  that  have  led  to  the  con-
struction of a 64 MW CSP plant outside of Las Vegas.

Utilities have demonstrated a serious interest in CSP for several reasons:

tion and increase grid reliability.

• The  widespread  availability  of  solar  energy  throughout  the  Southwest  pro-
vides utilities with flexibility in locating CSP plants near existing or planned
transmission lines.
• Placing  CSP  plants  on  the  ‘‘right’’  side  of  congestion  can  reduce  grid  conges-
• CSP  electricity  production  aligns  closely  with  periods  of  peak  electricity  de-
mand, reducing the need for investment in new generating plants and trans-
mission system upgrades.
• Thermal storage or the hybridization of CSP systems with natural gas avoids
the  problems  of  solar  intermittency  and  allows  the  plant  to  dispatch  power
to the line when it is needed.
• Large  centrally-located  power  plants  are  the  types  of  systems  that  the  utili-
• Once the CSP plant is built, its energy costs are fixed; this stands in contrast
to  fossil  fueled  plants  that  have  experienced  large  fluctuations  in  fuel  prices
during the last several years.
• The economic studies performed by the states show that a relatively small up-
front  investment  can  result  in  downstream  tax  revenues  for  the  State  and
local governments.

ties have operated for years and with which they are most comfortable.

Utility  representatives  expressed  particular  interest  in  CSP  because  its  ability  to
store  energy  enables  solar  power  to  be  dispatched  to  the  grid  through  their  entire
period  of  peak  demand,  or  whenever  else  it  is  needed.  CSP  was  also  attractive  to
them  because  of  its  size  (50–250MW),  use  of  conventional  steam  turbine  power
blocks, and the ability to hybridize CSP plants with natural gas.

Utilities  have  indicated  that  even  with  storage  and  the  other  advantages  men-
tioned  above,  it  is  hard  for  them  to  justify  purchasing  CSP  power  above  10  cents/
kWh when they can buy less expensive wind power. In California, utilities can pass
along the higher cost of renewable energy to their rate payers as long as it’s under
about 10 cent/kWh. Reaching 10 cent/kWh is thus important for early market pene-
tration.  The  federal  investment  tax  credit  is  important  because  it  does  much  to
bridge the cost gap. It is also important for the cost of CSP power to be at 5–7 cents/

47

kWh  by  2015.  So  early  market  penetration  of  CSP  could  be  driven  by  a  long-term
extension of the 30 percent investment tax credit for commercial solar technologies.
But  if  the  cost  of  CSP  power  is  too  high  when  the  tax  credit  expires,  the  market
will take a significant downturn or become completely stagnant. An objective of the
DOE and NREL CSP R&D activities would be to decrease the cost of the technology
in a timely enough fashion so the market remains healthy when the tax credits ex-
pire.

To  achieve  this  objective,  we  must  reduce  CSP  costs  to  provide  intermediate
power  at  5–7  cents/kWh  with  4–6  hrs.  of  thermal  storage.  These  activities  would
focus  on  developing  the  solar  collector,  receiver,  and  other  components  of  trough
plants to attain the system goal.

To  reach  the  long-term  objective  of  providing  baseload  power,  we  will  need  to  es-
tablish  feasibility,  develop  components,  evaluate,  and  test  new  system  concepts  be-
yond the trough plant design. The concepts likely to be examined include power tow-
ers, distributed power towers, concentrating line focus receiver (linear Fresnel), and
dishes  w/storage.  The  criteria  for  developing  these  technologies  will  include  a  de-
tailed analysis that defines the current state of the technology, the needed advance-
ments in efficiency and cost of each component, the development and manufacturing
pathways  needed  to  achieve  the  goal,  the  time  to  achieve  the  advancements,  and
the ability of the industry partner to commercialize the technology.
THE PHOTOVOLTAICS R&D STRATEGY

Prior  to  January  2006,  our  research  focused  on  technical  progress  through  in-
creasing  the  conversion  efficiencies  of  solar  cells  and  reducing  the  manufacturing
costs of photovoltaic modules. Our national laboratories—NREL and Sandia—imple-
mented  this  R&D,  which  included  providing  relatively  stable  funding  to  companies
and  universities,  resulting  in  steady,  incremental  progress.  Hundreds  of  individual
projects  were  funded  at  the  national  laboratories,  universities,  and  companies  that
generated continued interest in photovoltaics throughout the country.

But this picture changed after January 2006. We began with a change in program
strategy,  along  with  a  fresh  look  at  the  solar  energy  industry  by  the  investment
community,  and  supportive  policies  from  numerous  State  and  local  programs.  The
focus  of  our  research  shifted  from  technical  progress  on  components  to  integrated
PV  systems.  Under  the  new  strategy,  companies  funded  by  SAI  are  expected  to  de-
velop  products  for  priority  markets,  and  industry  is  expected  to  influence  the  re-
search agenda for the national laboratories and universities.

Dramatic  progress  is  anticipated  from  multiple  competitive  solicitations,  coupled
with an aggressive process to evaluate results and eliminate awardees showing less
than substantial progress. The first set of large awards, called Technology Pathway
Partnerships,  will  support  multiple  industry-led  partnerships  over  the  full  value-
chain,  whereas  smaller  projects  will  target  earlier-stage  technologies.  Public  atten-
tion will be attracted to these high-visibility projects, with the intent of stimulating
consumer interest and eliminating barriers to PV deployment.

Perhaps  the  most  dramatic  evidence  of  this  new  strategy  was  DOE’s  significant
investment in a new funding opportunity for industry-led Technology Pathway Part-
nerships.  Entrance  criteria  for  commercial  applicants  included  prototype  compo-
nents, pilot production demonstration, and an established business case. At the end
of three year projects, awardees were expected to have commercial PV systems and
subsystems  with  annual  production  of  greater  than  25  MW.  These  partnerships  in-
clude collaboration with national laboratories, universities, and suppliers to focus on
the development, testing, demonstration, validation, and interconnection of PV com-
ponents, systems and manufacturing equipment. Through these efforts, the Partner-
ships are expected to reduce the installed cost to consumers to $0.05–$0.10 per kWh
by 2015—a price low enough to open up all major U.S. electricity markets.

Earlier this year, 12 Technology Pathway Partnership projects were selected to re-
ceive up to $168 million in DOE funding over the next three years, with the award-
ees  contributing  over  50  percent  of  the  funding  for  these  projects.  Representing  a
broad  cross-section  of  U.S.  industry,  the  projects  involve  more  than  50  companies,
14 universities, three non-profits, and two national laboratories in 20 states. The se-
lected projects’ leaders are Amonix, BP Solar, Boeing, Dow Chemical, General Elec-
tric,  Miasole,  Nanosolar,  SunPower,  United  Solar  Ovonic,  Konarka,  GreenRay  and
Soliant. This new portfolio continues our historical investment in thin films and in-
creases  support  significantly  for  concentrator  photovoltaics  and  crystalline  silicon
technologies.  The  portfolio  is  intended  to  deliver  on  the  near-term  potential  in  resi-
dential  markets  and  commercial  markets,  which  are  targeted  by  32  percent  and  48
percent  of  the  funding,  respectively,  with  longer-term  utility  markets  following  at
20 percent.

In addition to the Technology Pathway Partnerships, DOE will be releasing a va-
riety of other funding opportunities to round out the PV R&D pipeline. These oppor-
tunities  will  focus  on  developing  new  materials  and  processes  for  solar  electric  con-
version, transitioning fundamental science studies into the fabrication of new PV de-
vices, shortening the timeline for companies to transition pre-commercial PV module
technologies  into  full-scale  manufacturing,  supporting  university  materials  science
and  process  engineering  research  and  improving  inverters  and  power  electronics  in
distributed PV systems.
THE NREL PHOTOVOLTAICS R&D PROGRAM

The  Solar  Energy  Research  Institute  (SERI),  now  NREL,  was  originally  created
to  develop  the  technologies  needed  to  foster  a  dynamic  solar  industry.  Our  Labora-
tory  has  succeeded  in  large  part  at  fulfilling  this  charter  and  has  been  vital  to  the
development  of  the  PV  industry.  In  recent  years,  this  industry  has  seen  dynamic
change and significant growth—thanks to past R&D successes at NREL.

Importantly,  this  change  has  included  the  emergence  of  significant  internal  R&D
at  start-up  and  established  companies,  as  well  as  a  proliferation  of  PV  research  at
university  laboratories  around  the  country.  With  the  industry  and  academic  ele-
ments of the domestic PV R&D community changing significantly, in early 2007 we
began  to  reexamine  our  research  strategy  to  ensure  that  it  will  be  complementary
and relevant in years to come.

During  spring  of  2007,  we  began  formulating  a  new  multi-year  research  plan—
with associated personnel and equipment plans—that recognizes this changing mar-
ket  context  and  is  being  developed  with  input  from  industry  and  academic  collabo-
rators. This planning process is intended to ensure the long-term vitality of NREL’s
research and its mission to help foster and sustain a strong American industry.

The new plan resulting from this process will improve on the existing concept for
managing  NREL’s  PV  R&D  portfolio  in  several  critical  ways:  (1)  For  a  given  tech-
nology  development  ‘‘roadmap,’’  the  plan  will  more  explicitly  link  the  parameters
targeted  for  device  performance  or  process  development  to  the  market  impact  they
would make if commercialized (e.g., in terms of change to commercial module costs,
manufacturing  equipment  capital  cost,  or  manufacturing  bills  of  materials);  (2)  It
will  specifically  identify  the  conditions  and  parameters  under  which  a  given  device
technology  or  process  will  be  sufficiently  proven  to  be  transferred  via  licensing  or
other  means  for  commercialization;  (3)  It  will  exhibit  changing  priorities  over  time,
as  research  tasks  in  various  areas  are  planned  to  be  completed  and  as  new  tech-
nologies emerge for further development; and (4) The plan will explicitly identify re-
search tasks that will be performed in industry, academia, or other institutions that
are relevant to the activities and outcomes of NREL research activities.

We  are  extremely  excited  about  our  progress  thus  far  under  the  new  strategic
planning  process.  And  we  look  forward  to  sharing  the  resulting  R&D  priorities  and
management procedures in October 2007, at the start of our next fiscal year.
PHOTOVOLTAICS PROGRAM OUTCOMES AND BENEFITS

Upon  realizing  the  SAI  goal,  it  is  expected  that  roughly  two  million  metric  tons
per  year  of  carbon  emissions  will  be  avoided  by  2015  and  PV  will  provide  approxi-
mately five GW of electricity generating capacity—displacing roughly the equivalent
of five coal-fired power plants—enough to energy to power about 1.25 million house-
holds. This is equivalent to 10 times the amount of PV installed today.6

Distributed  solar  technologies  will  enable  our  ultimate  goal  of  affordable  zero  en-
ergy  homes  and  buildings  which  fulfills  the  President’s  Advanced  Energy  Initiative
vision  of  changing  the  way  we  power  our  homes  and  businesses.  Net-zero  energy
homes  and  buildings  produce  as  much  energy  as  they  consume  through  improved
efficiency  combined  with  renewable  energy,  such  as  solar,  providing  needed  power
and offsetting any utility-provided energy over the course of a year. Optimizing the
balance of energy efficiency improvements and solar PV will result in the most cost
effective  net  zero  energy  home  or  building  and  connecting  the  solar  PV  system  to
the grid can allow customers to sell the excess solar energy back to the utility.

Highly  efficient  buildings  with  distributed  technologies  reduce  peak  demand,  and
will ease the need for expensive new generating capacity, transmission and distribu-
tion lines as our economy grows. Building-integrated PV can make the buildings sec-
tor  a  source  of  energy  diversity  and  low  carbon  electricity  (the  building  sector  cur-

rently accounts for 39 percent of U.S. energy use). Total energy use in the buildings
sector is projected to increase an additional 30 percent through 2025, and we believe
that solar PV can meet much of this demand.

As the Committee’s Discussion Draft notes, educating energy consumers is critical
to achieving the market goals I have previously indicated. One of the ways we edu-
cate  Americans  about  the  new  choices  they  have  in  heating,  cooling  and  powering
their  buildings  is  a  unique  project  that  encourages  the  development  of  zero  energy
homes  called  the  Solar  Decathlon.  The  Decathlon,  sponsored  by  DOE,  challenges
schools  of  architecture  and  engineering  to  design  solar  powered,  zero-carbon,  self-
sustaining  houses  from  the  ground  up  to  see  which  house  is  the  most  aesthetically
pleasing  and  which  house  performs  the  best.  Twenty  collegiate  teams  from  the
United  States,  Canada,  Puerto  Rico,  Spain,  and  Germany  will  participate  in  this
year’s  competition,  which  will  be  held  on  the  National  Mall  from  October  12–20,
2007.  The  public  is  invited  to  visit  the  solar  village  and  tour  the  houses,  which
showcase the latest green building and energy efficient technologies.
BUILDING ON MOMENTUM: STRATEGY & PRIORITIES FOR 2007

During the first 18 months of the Solar America Initiative, DOE and NREL have
worked  together  to  implement  a  broad-reaching  change  in  strategy  with  one  clear
purpose:  to  make  PV  technologies  cost-competitive  in  all  major  domestic  grid-tied
markets  by  2015.  We  emphasize  that  this  change  was  not  implemented  simply  for
the  sake  of  change.  But  rather,  to  take  advantage  of  progress  in  module  efficiency
and  fabrication  principally  achieved  by  industry,  universities,  and  the  national  lab-
oratories  over  the  years.  These  successes  form  the  foundation  for  the  PV  systems
that we will be supporting in the future.

Priorities  in  2007  include  continuing  to  implement  the  funding  opportunities  de-
scribed  above.  We  will  also  establish  the  framework  for  additional  university  in-
volvement  in  the  Technology  Pathway  Partnerships  and  calibrate  our  Laboratory’s
research portfolio and future role. And finally, we will ramp-up our efforts in testing
and  evaluation  of  new  product  designs—an  activity  that  is  critical  to  assuring  the
reliability of the new products we are developing with industry.
SUMMARY:  BALANCING  SHORT-  AND  LONG-TERM  R&D  INVESTMENTS

IN SOLAR POWER

To  address  our  near-term  needs  in  solar  power  we  need  a  national  strategy  that
promotes  the  deployment  of  solar  systems  and  processes  that  are  ready  to  serve  us
today. At the same time, to address our longer-term needs and achieve a significant
contribution from solar power technologies, we must make a major new commitment
to  the  research  required  to  deliver  the  next,  and  subsequent,  generations  of  CSP,
PV and other new technologies.

The  good  news  is  that  the  United  States  can  take  back  the  global  leadership  it
once  had  in  the  solar  energy  field—what  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  most  important
new  industries  of  this  century—through  investing  wisely  now  and  into  the  future.
The  timing  is  fortuitous,  because  by  most  accounts  the  next  big  market  for  global
renewable energy in here in the United States.

Thank you.

DISCUSSION

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you so much all of you for your opening re-
marks.  We  have  a  good  amount  of  Members  here  so  I  want  to  get
going  pretty  quickly.  Let  us  try  to  limit  questions  and  answers  to
five minutes and see how far we get.

SOLAR ENERGY IN GERMANY

I  would  like  to  kick  off  with  some  of  the  comments  Mr.  Resch
made in terms of what we can be doing as a country in comparison
to  Germany.  What  happened  in  Germany,  and  for  the  panel,  you
know,  what  can  we  learn  from  them,  what  are  the  take-aways,
what are some of the mistakes and the pitfalls?

Mr. RESCH. Thank you, Congresswoman. What Germany did first
and  foremost  was  to  make  a  long-term  investment  in  solar  energy
and  they  did  it  during  the  worst  economic  downtown  since  World

War II. So what they basically said is, we need to diversify our en-
ergy  portfolio,  we  are  becoming  increasingly  dependent  upon  nat-
ural  gas  coming  from  Russia,  and  they  felt  it  was  very  important
to  look  at  what  natural  resources  they  did  have  in  place,  and  that
is certainly solar, although their resources are lower than ours was
one of those resources, and they looked at all renewables including
wind and geothermal and biomass. They created a structure which
is a 20-year incentive structure to encourage the use of renewables.
It is called a feed-in tariff, or the EEG is the acronym in Germany,
and  what  it  does  is  provide  again  a  fixed  incentive  over  a  long  pe-
riod  of  time.  It  doesn’t  really  translate,  if  you  will,  to  the  United
States  because  our  electricity  laws  are  very  different  but  the  most
important  thing  that  they  did  was  to  give  a  long-term  incentive
structure.  Now,  what  has  happened  is,  manufacturing  has  ex-
panded  rapidly  in  Germany  and  they  have  created  almost  40,000
new  jobs  in  Germany  in  the  last  five  years  because  of  the  EEG.
These are manufacturing jobs in eastern Germany, a lot of installa-
tion  jobs.  You  are  seeing  solar  go  up  on  barns,  on  homes,  on  fac-
tories,  really  all  over  the  country,  and  they  have  gone  from  being
a country that ignored, if you will, solar to being the global leader.
They  install  eight  times  as  much  PV  as  we  do  each  year.  They  in-
stall  about  80,000  solar  water  heating  systems  each  year.  In  the
United States, we install about 6,000 solar water heating systems.
And  because  of  that,  they  have  really  created  an  economic  force
and  growth  in  Germany  that  frankly  hasn’t  been  seen  since  the
high  tech,  frankly  the  chip  industry  is  a  classic  example,  the  U.S.
technology  invented  in  the  United  States  being  commercialized  by
the  Germans  and  the  Japanese  and  increasingly  the  Chinese.  So
what they have done is provide a long-term incentive and structure
for encouraging people to use solar.

SOLAR CHECK-OFF PROGRAM

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you.  How  would  the  proposed  solar  re-
search  and  promotion  program  or  the  check-off  program  enable  in-
dustry to promote the use of solar power in a way that it currently
cannot,  and  why  is  the  involvement  of  the  Department  of  Energy
for this program so useful?

Mr.  RESCH.  The  check-off  program  really  does  several  things.
First  and  perhaps  most  important  is,  it  allows  all  of  the  industry
to  collectively  pool  its  resources  together.  So  when  you  look  at  all
of the individual companies that are out there, they just don’t have
the budgets, if you will, to do a national campaign on their own or
even  a  branding  or  marketing  campaign  but  the  beautiful  thing
about  a  check-off  program,  it  is  a  very,  very  small  surcharge  that
then  collectively  and  certainly  over  time  creates  a  pool  of  money
that  then  can  be  used  for  education  and  outreach.  The  second  is
really  the  public  perception  on  solar.  When  you  do  the  polling  and
you ask people what do they think of solar, they want to see more
solar, they want to use more solar. My gosh, you know, you inven-
tory—you  ask  anybody  in  this  audience  behind  me,  I  guarantee
half  the  people  would  say—or  more  would  say  I  want  to  put  solar
on  my  house  at  some  point  in  the  future.  But  they  need  to  figure
out how to do that. We need to have a mechanism that allows con-
sumers  to  learn  more  about  solar,  to  learn  that  this  is  what  solar

looks  like.  It  is  a  beautiful  thing.  It  is  elegant  technology,  you
know,  that  it  has  incredible  environmental  benefits,  that  although
the costs may be high up front in the long run, it does pay for itself
over  time  and  can  be  a  good  hedge  against  let  us  just  say  higher
energy  prices.  So  that  type  of  mechanism  needs  to  be  pulled  to-
gether,  and  what  we  have  found  is  that  programs  like  ‘‘Got  Milk’’
and  the  pork  program  and  the  cattlemen’s  programs  have  worked.
They  have  worked  effectively  for  agriculture  and  industries  that
again are diverse, that have, you know, literally thousands of small
farmers  or  that  have  hundreds  of  major,  you  know,  agricultural
providers  but  that  collectively  when  they  pool  their  resources  can
get  something  done.  I  think  the  Department  of  Energy  becomes  a
critical  entity  because  it  allows,  let  us  just  say  the  government
input  and  coordination  on  research  and  public  perception  and  so
what  we  would  want  to  make  sure  is  anything  that  we  are  doing
with  this  program  is  operating  in  a  very  consistent  manner  with
the  Solar  America  Initiative  and  research  and  development  pro-
grams  that  are  going  on  in  the  DOE,  in  large  part  to  make  sure
that there is no duplication and that the federal resources are used
as  effectively  as  possible  but  also  to  get  the  insight  from  the  re-
searchers around the country into this program.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you.
The  Chair  now  recognizes  Ranking  Member  Hall.  Thank  you  for

being here.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, ma’am. Thank you very much, and thanks
for  a  good  panel  here,  and  Rhone,  good  to  see  you  again.  You  are
too young, but——

Mr. RESCH. That is changing quickly, sir.
Mr. HALL.—I think you are going to be a fast learner, and I like

your natural-gas background.

COMPARISON OF SOLAR ENERGY TO ANWR

Mr.  Hayden,  in  your  testimony  you  have  advocated  a  study  on
locating  large-scale  concentrated  solar  power  on  federal  land,  and
you said a single 250-megawatt facility would occupy 1,250 to 2,500
contiguous  acres  of  land.  With  the  hard,  cold  facts  being  that  the
proposed  drilling  areas  for  ANWR  is  2,000  acres,  I  believe  that  is
the  correct  figure,  with  the  potential  for  recovering  over  10  billion
barrels  of  oil,  a  possible  50  percent  increase  in  total  U.S.  proven
reserves  creating  roughly  one  million  jobs  here  in  the  United
States,  my  question  is,  can  a  solar  installation  produce  this  much
of a return on the same amount of land or more?

Mr. HAYDEN. Thank you, Congressman, for the question.
Mr.  HALL.  Did  you  write  the  question?  You  didn’t  send  me  the

question, did you? I really want a good answer.

Mr. HAYDEN. You asked the question in terms of I think produc-
tivity  of  the  land  is,  and  obviously  we  all  understand  that  that  is
a  very  complex  topic  to  look  at  productivity  of  land  use  and  so  I
think  there  would  be  a  very  imperfect  comparison  between  an
ANWR drilling site and a solar site. In fact, if we look at what the
challenges are to making solar actually competitive, you know, just
on shear costs, we are challenged in the sense that nature has put
together  the  fossil  fuel  resources  into  highly  dense  form  and  ex-
tracting  it  with,  you  know,  resource  extraction  may  not  have  a

52

large  footprint  but  the  counterbalance,  the  land  use  of  the  solar
does not deplete the resource. It is working in real time to harvest
sunlight.  Secondly,  there  is  a  ripple  effect  where  the  technology  is
advanced  into  bringing  the  solar  into  play.  So  I  would  agree  with
you that if you look at the footprint alone as one metric competing
against  fossil  fuel  in  a  highly  dense  form  is  very  challenging  for
any  renewable  but  if  you  look  at  how  fossil  fuel  over  its  entire  life
cycle  of  being  replaced  could  compete  with  solar,  then  solar  now
has an advantage because the technology is very efficient in terms
of,  say,  nominally  25  percent  conversion  of  sunlight  into  energy
where fossil fuel has a much lower efficiency on its entire basis. So
all  these  things  are  of  course  arguable  in  how  you  look  at  it  but
the  solar  technology  does  have  the  opportunity  to  deliver  forever
and——

Mr. HALL. They could exist and be compatible together?
Mr.  HAYDEN.  I  think  that  is  a  very  important  point.  We  have
seen  in  my  work  of  trying  to  combine  mining  uses,  for  example,
where they have buffer zone and land with productive uses of solar.
Mr.  HALL.  With  us  being  so  totally  dependent  upon  people  that
really  don’t  trust  us  and  we  don’t  trust,  sitting  here  with  a  fear
that  China  will  offer  them  a  buck  a  barrel  more  than  we  are  pay-
ing  them,  do  you  like  the  comparison  when  they  say  don’t  disturb
little ANWR, the pristine little area of ANWR when it is 19 million
acres  and  we  are  using  2,000.  Did  you  hear  the  comparison  that
it  would  be  like  putting  a  postage  stamp  at  the  end  of  a  tennis
court and saying that ruined the whole tennis court? The good com-
bination  of  the  two  with  solar  would  be  the  same.  It  doesn’t  hurt
the land at all.

Mr.  HAYDEN.  Well,  I  am  not  sure  that  Alaska  would  be  a  great
place for the solar equipment. It would generate pretty good during
half the year and not so good during the other half of the year, but
I  think  there  is  a  lot  of  opportunity  for  hybrid  composite  uses  of
land.

MORE ON SOLAR CHECK-OFF PROGRAM

Mr.  HALL.  But  you  make  another  point  there.  If  it  is  dark  half

the year, what are they hiding up there anyway?

I  have  one  other  question  of  Dr.  Arvizu  on  the  neutrality  of  the
Department  of  Energy  on  check-offs.  Are  there  any  other  check-off
programs  at  DOE?  Should  there  be  a  generic  renewable  check-off
program? Is that a good use of DOE’s resources? I will just give you
the full barrel.

Dr.  ARVIZU.  Thank  you.  Actually  there  are  merits  to  what  I  be-
lieve  are  intended  in  terms  of  the  value  that  check-off  programs
bring.  I  think  the  rationale  at  the  Department  of  Energy  is  what
is  the  role  of  the  Department  and  how  should  it  endorse  or  other-
wise  encourage  what  we  think  are  very  appropriate  education  pro-
grams,  and  I  think  Mr.  Resch  actually  articulated  very  nicely  the
benefits  and  the  value  that  educating  the  public  has  in  terms  of
promoting the use of renewable energy. The question is still I think
an  open  one  inside  the  Department  as  to  whether  or  not  the  De-
partment  has,  you  know,  a  role  that  couldn’t  be  satisfied  by  per-
haps  closer  coordination  with  the  private  sector.  One  of  the  things
we  are  trying  to  do  at  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory

is  connect  very  closely  with  the  industry  and  with  the  private  sec-
tor  to  make  sure  that  our  goals  and  objectives  are  aligned  and
these  public-private  partnerships  provide  as  much  benefit  both  to
the  taxpayer  as  well  as  to  the  private  sector.  In  the  end,  this  is
about making investments. This is about having return on those in-
vestments,  putting  market  signals  where  the  value  is  extracted,
and  we  have  got  a  lot  of  work  to  do  in  those  particular  areas.  So
the  check-off  program,  although  it  is  important,  isn’t  the  highest
priority that we are working on but we see the merit and the value
of it and open for discussion as to——

Mr.  HALL.  My  time  is  up.  If  I  had  more  time,  I  would  ask  you
if being open, you mean they are going to remain neutral on check-
off,  and  question,  why  shouldn’t  DOE  be  focused  on  research?  And
I may write you a letter and ask you those things.

Thank you, Madam Chairman.
Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  and  let  me  also  note  that
in  this  draft  legislation,  no  money  would  come  directly  from  DOE
from the check-off. It would all come from the private sector.

The Chair recognizes Mr. McNerney.
Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mrs.  Chairwoman,  and  I  just  want
to  say  that  I  am  very  excited  about  the  future  of  solar  and  I  ap-
plaud you for the bill. It is a nicely crafted bill.

MANUFACTURING COST FOR SOLAR ENERGY

You  know,  the  real  limitation  for  solar.  You  have  talked  about
education.  Education  is  a  limiting  factor  but  the  real  limitation  is
the price. I come from the wind industry and what happens in that
industry  is  that  as  we  get  on  the  manufacturing  curve,  the  cost
goes  down  just  out  of  production  volume,  but  I  am  not  convinced
that  is  the  case  with  solar,  especially  with  photovoltaic.  So  my
question I guess for Dr. Arvizu is, do you see the technology in pho-
tovoltaic  and  in  CSP  leading  to  lower  cost  with  increasing  volume
or  again  is  some  type  of  technical  limitation  going  to  prevent  the
cost  from  coming  down,  and  if  not,  could  you  kind  of  go  into  that
a little bit for me?

Dr.  ARVIZU.  Yeah,  sure,  and  I  know  that  Mr.  Resch  has  some-
thing else to say as well. I would offer that the incentive programs
that  have  been  put  in  place  both  in  Germany  and  in  Japan  have
demonstrated  very  clearly  that  with  these  policy  measures  and  in-
centives  and  encouraging  a  market  which  now  has  exponential
growth does in fact reduce the cost, and what we are seeing is that
the  costs  are  coming  down,  things  like  balance  assistance  cost  in-
verters  and  installation  costs  and  things  that  relate  to  siting  and
installation are all in fact now a much smaller fraction of the over-
all system cost than they used to be. So it does inform our research
programs  because  I  think  there  is  plenty  of  space  and  opportunity
to  reduce  costs  both  on  what  I  call  the  business  end  of  the  tech-
nology  which  has  to  do  with  the  conversion  process  from  solar  to
electricity,  and  whether  that  is  at  the  cell  level  for  crystalline  sil-
icon  technology  or  at  the  module  level  when  it  is  thin-film  tech-
nology,  we  see  tremendous  progress  being  made  there,  and  it  is  a
matter of a lot more volume, a lot of learning curves. Clearly first-
generation  technology  is  on  an  S  curve,  if  you  are  familiar  with
how  technology  finds  its  way  into  the  marketplace,  and  you  prob-

54

ably  need  to  jump  onto  second-generation  technology,  which  is  a
different S curve with different learning curves.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  We  are  past  second-generation  technology  with

solar photovoltaic now, aren’t we?

Dr.  ARVIZU.  Well,  not  in  the  parlance  that  we  use.  You  know,
first-generation  technology  is  the  technology  I  started  with  in  the
1980s  and  it  is  the  staple.  I  sponsored  this  research  literally  in
1985 with Dick Swanson at Stanford University. It is now commer-
cial  product.  Technology  that  we  are  working  on  in  the  laboratory
now  is  what  we  call  second  generation—thin  films,  concentrating,
a  variety  of  high-efficiency  technologies.  There  is  yet  a  third  gen-
eration.  That  is  the  organic,  really  high  efficiency,  I  call  it  revolu-
tionary.  It  is  maybe  a  few  years  down  the  road  but  we  are  right
now trying to get second generation into the marketplace. So there
is a lot of room to be had and I think what you will find is maybe
these  companies  are  investing  in  second-generation  technology
today.

Mr.  RESCH.  And  Congressman,  if  I  could  just  add  a  couple  of
points  in  response.  We  have  seen  historically  the  price  of  solar
come  down  so  when  the  incentives  for  solar  were  dropped  in  1983,
the market continued. I mean, it dropped but, you know, we contin-
ued  to  use  solar  energy,  and  since  1983  we  have  seen  the  price  of
photovoltaics come down by 90 percent. The learning curve that we
have  seen  is  for  every  doubling  of  manufacturing  capacity,  we  see
about a 20 percent reduction in the price of photovoltaics. So what
is really needed is a long-term stable driver for the market so that
if  I  am  a  manufacturer,  I  am  going  to  scale  up  my  production.  I
mean,  most  of  the  manufacturing  facilities  are  20-,  30-,  40-mega-
watt  plants.  That  is  pretty  small.  We  need  gigawatts-scale  plants,
and  the  only  way  you  are  going  to  get  that  is  by  providing  a  long
enough  incentive  so  that  you  can  make  sure  your  investment  in
that  plant  is  actually  returned.  And  the  example  I  use  for  wind,  I
think  we  are  probably  a  decade  behind  wind.  Wind  has  had  the
production  tax  credit,  granted  on  and  off,  but  they  have  had  the
production  tax  credit  for  14  years.  Solar  has  had  the  investment
tax credit for about 17 months. So, you know, the market is really
just starting in the United States with respect to any kind of mar-
ket  incentives  coming  from  the  Federal  Government,  so  we  are
hopeful  we  will  see  a  long-term  incentive  that  will  spur  manufac-
turing, then drive down costs.

TAX INCENTIVES FOR SOLAR ENERGY

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  And,  you  know,  in  wind,  the  tax  credits  had  a
big impact. The initial tax credits were investment tax credits and
they  caused  a  lot  of  substandard  equipment  to  be  put  in  the  field
and  it  kind  of  hurt  the  industry’s  reputation  for  years  and  years.
What sort of tax incentive do you think would be the most effective
for solar then, given that history?

Mr. RESCH. Because solar tends to be distributed generation and
having  a  very  high  upfront  cost,  we  found  that  the  investment  tax
credit works best. At the end of the day, the investment tax credit
isn’t large enough for you to put in expensive non-operating equip-
ment.  Everything  is  UL  listed.  Everything  comes  with,  you  know,
certification. Everything has to be grid connected, and with the in-

vestment tax credit, it still has to pay for itself in a reasonable pe-
riod of time. So we are seeing the commercial segment of the mar-
ketplace,  so  think  of  Lowe’s,  think  of  Home  Depot,  Fresh  Field
stores putting solar up on their roofs where you have got an energy
manager  and  you  have  got  an  account  watching  to  make  sure  the
system  performs,  very  sophisticated  equipment  that  is  performing,
so the ITC works best for us.

Mr. MCNERNEY. I mean, basically what you have just said is that
the  investment  tax  credit  is  probably  more  effective  than  produc-
tion tax credits for solar?

Mr. RESCH. That is correct. The production tax credit is—the bot-

tom line is yes, the ITC works better than the PTC.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thanks for your honesty there. I am out of time.
Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Inglis.

TAX INCENTIVES AND NET METERING OF SOLAR ENERGY

Mr.  INGLIS.  Following  up  on  Mr.  McNerney’s  questions,  what
should be more effective, some kind of tax credit or a net metering
kind of proposal?

Mr.  RESCH.  You  really  need  both.  Net  metering  allows  the  sys-
tem  to  work  effectively,  so  just  to  give  you  an  example,  on  a  day
like  today,  even  though  I  am  using  air  conditioning  at  my  house,
I  am  generating  excess  electricity.  If  Jane  was  living  next  door  to
me,  it  would  be  going  into  her  house  and  it  would  be  going  into
Hal’s  house  as  well,  and  what  that  does  is,  it  really  stabilizes  the
grid.  It  allows  utilities,  if  you  will,  although  they  are  still  going  to
buy  peak  demand,  to  have  less  congestion,  less  constraint  on  the
distribution grid.

Mr.  INGLIS.  It  also  makes  it  much  more  attractive  for  me  to  put

into a system, right, because——

Mr. RESCH. Then you wouldn’t have to buy a battery backup sys-
tem that would store, so it actually is a lower cost. You almost use
the grid, if you will, as your battery or as your reserve.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Right,  and  I  would  also  have  the  capacity  to  recoup
some of my investment. I mean, we have to figure out a way to pay
for this thing, putting it on my roof, and so a tax credit is one pos-
sibility. Another possibility is net metering.

Mr. RESCH. Net metering, it differs by every state. Right now we
don’t  have  net  metering  laws  so  what  exists  in  Maryland  is  very
different  from  what  we  have  in  Virginia,  which  is  very  different
from  what  we  have  in  D.C.  And  so  it  is  very  difficult  from  a  busi-
ness model to determine which one is the right one. If we had uni-
form  net  metering,  that  would  make  a  very  big  difference,  and  if
you had time-of-use rates, which means that you are paying for the
price of—the real cost of the electricity on a day like today, I guar-
antee  Pepco  as  they  are  pulling  in  new  demand  isn’t  paying  eight
cents  per  kilowatt-hour.  They  are  probably  paying  20  cents  a  kilo-
watt-hour.

MORE ON SOLAR CHECK-OFF PROGRAM

Mr.  INGLIS.  Something  tells  me  that  our  friends  at  Energy  and
Commerce would say they have jurisdiction over that, that net me-
tering  thing,  but  it  is  fun  to  dream  about  such  topics.  Anyhow,  so

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

how about—speaking of jurisdiction, is this a voluntary check-off or
a mandatory check-off?

Mr.  RESCH.  It  is  a  mandatory  check-off  program  that  companies
then  have  the  option  of  opting  out  and  so  it  becomes  voluntary
after it is created.

Mr. INGLIS. And how does that work?
Mr.  RESCH.  You  would  pay  into  it  and  then  you  have  the  oppor-
tunity  to  request  a  refund.  So  what  this—the  way  the  structure
works,  and  this  is  a  very  important  part,  especially  as  the  U.S.
market  continues  to  develop  is,  we  are  importing—we  may  be  im-
porting more and more panels from China to avoid a free ridership
use  structure  of  the  program  so  that  everybody  pays  into  it  ini-
tially.  If  they  decide  they  don’t  want  to  support  the  program  for
whatever  reason,  then  they  can  opt  out  and  get  a  reimbursement
for the money that they paid in.

Mr.  INGLIS.  So  what  free  rider  would  not  go  to  that  extra  step
of  asking  for  a  refund?  Just  a  lazy  free  rider  that  doesn’t  realize
their opportunity or——

Mr.  RESCH.  It  forces  them  to  get  involved.  It  forces  them  to  see
the  merits  of  a  program.  It  forces  them  to  either  sit  on  the  board
or  at  least  engage  with  the  board  as  to  what  the  program  is  all
about  and  at  least  they  understand  it  so  they  are  making  a  con-
scious  decision  as  opposed  to  an  ignorant,  I  don’t  want  to  get  in-
volved  decision,  and  there  is  probably  peer  pressure  that  would
keep people to participate. I am sure that exists in agriculture too.
Mr. INGLIS. I ask this question—does anybody know, is this a se-
quential referral or something or—to Energy and Commerce. Do we
have jurisdiction over it? I don’t know. It is an interesting question
if we would have jurisdiction over such a mandatory check-off.

I yield to the Chair.
Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Mr.  Inglis,  when  we  put  this  legislation  together,
we  were  obviously  looking  at  jurisdiction.  Because  we  had  a  panel
that  was  qualified,  we  thought  it  was  important  to  come  and  have
a  discussion  about  this  because  this  is  one  of  the  main  parts  of
what would be so helpful for the industry. That is why we are still
working on that.

STORAGE AND EFFICIENCY OF SOLAR ENERGY

Mr. INGLIS. And a question for the panel is, which is more crucial
to  it?  Is  it  a  storage  question  or  the  efficiency  question—efficiency
of  conversion?  As  I  understand  it,  the  solar  cells—I  wish  I  knew
how to explain it. Roscoe will explain it to us next. He has got the
next question, to explain this conversion issue and the efficiency of
it.  I  don’t  know  how  to  express  it.  But  we  are  talking  a  lot  about
storage  here  and  we  are  not  talking  much  about  the  efficiency  of
the conversion.

Mr.  ARVIZU.  Let  me  take  a  stab  at  that.  I  think  it  really  comes
down to the economics. It really comes down to how many cents per
kilowatt-hour  am  I  paying  life  cycle  for  the  power.  When  you  add
storage  to  concentrating  solar  power,  you  improve  or  increase  the
value by a tremendous amount because, as Rhone talked about ear-
lier,  you  are  putting—you  are  allowing  there  to  be  essentially
power generation at a time when you may in fact have peak power
use,  which  there  is  a  higher  value  on  that  certainly  to  the  utility.

57

I  know  that  in  Spain  there  is  a  feed-in  tariff  as  well  and  they  put
a  big  premium  on  having  storage,  in  other  words,  being  able  to
generate  electricity  even  past  the  normal  sunlight  hours,  and  by
putting  in  the  generation,  the  developers  actually  get  an  18—I  am
sorry—an 80 percent additional return on investment by putting in
the storage, so that is just in economic terms. The efficiency is im-
portant.  Typically  the  cost  is  important  so  it  is  the  efficiency  and
a  cost  tradeoff  so  sometimes  you  have  high  efficiency,  high  cost,
sometimes  you  have  low  efficiency,  low  cost.  Sometimes  those  are
equivalent,  and  if  there  is  a  tradeoff,  I  think  you  need  to  go  back
to  how  many  cents  per  kilowatt-hour  life  cycle,  you  know,  all  in,
all  out  kind  of  a  metric  to  determine  which  one  has  the  most
attractiveness to it.

Mr.  HAYDEN.  If  I  could  jump  in,  there  is  a—Congressman,  there
is a diversity of technologies in the solar field which is a good char-
acteristic  of  the  technology  space.  We  are  going  everywhere  from
the  photovoltaics  that  Rhone  brought  the  example  of  to  concen-
trating  solar  power,  which  is  large  scale,  and  if  I  can  kind  of  put
the  example  out  there  of,  people  are  very  concerned  about  what
their  price  of  electricity  is  primarily  until  the  lights  go  out  and
then all of a sudden they start having concern about the reliability
of electricity, and so around the world prices of electricity and reli-
ability  both  vary  situationally.  As  we  start  with  solar  today,  the
primary focus outside of this proposed work is on efficiency. Every-
one  is  looking  at  cost.  But  as  solar  becomes  more  successful,  just
like  wind  has  become  more  successful,  then  greater  attention  gets
paid to the reliability. So it depends on where you are in the devel-
opment. First you worry about cost. Then you worry about cost plus
reliability, and I think that is what is looked at here is that we are
starting  to  be  more  realistic  about  solar  than  we  were  a  few  years
ago.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Bartlett, please.

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUPPORT FOR SOLAR ENERGY

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  Thank  you  for  your  testi-
mony.  There  are  three  groups  in  our  country  that  ought  to  have
common cause in wanting to move away from fossil fuels to renew-
ables,  solar  included,  and  I  am  wondering  if  those  three  groups
have joined—have locked arms or are they now criticizing the other
group’s  premise.  One  is  the  global  warming  people,  and  of  course,
after  you  have  paid  the  carbon  price  of  producing  the  solar  panel,
there  is  no  carbon  emission  in  producing  power.  There  are  the  na-
tional  security  people,  who  lament  the  fact  that  we  are  so  depend-
ent on foreign oil and to the extent we can use solar, we are going
to  use  less  foreign  oil.  And  there  are  the  peak  oil  people  who  be-
lieve  that  although  we  may  muddle  through  the  global  warming
and  the  national  security,  there  is  no  muddling  through  peak  oil.
If  it  is  not  there,  it  is  not  there.  And  these  three  groups  ought  to
have  common  cause.  Have  they  locked  arms  or  are  they  still  criti-
cizing each other’s premise?

Mr.  RESCH.  I  think  everyone  has  been  very  busy  and  focused  on
their  own  respective  issues,  but  having  said  that,  there  is  a  very
clear  unification  that  these  three  issues  need  to  be  addressed  in  a
very  similar  fashion.  They  are  not  mutually  exclusive.  They  have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

58

to be dealt with at the same time, and I would say that the groups
working  on  global  warming,  national  security,  peak  oil  and  cer-
tainly solar, we are engaged with all three of those groups.

COMPARISON OF CENTRALIZED TO DISTRIBUTED SOLAR

ENERGY

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Well,  the  solutions  to  those  problems  are  exactly
the  same:  move  away  from  fossil  fuels  to  sustainable  renewables
and of course solar is a big one of those. If you have grid tie, what
is the advantage of a large, centralized production rather than put-
ting it over 1,000 home rooftops? I would think that the most wide-
ly—the more widely dispersed it is, the better off it is. So why are
we focusing on these big facilities out in the desert that are a long
way  from  populations,  and  of  course  the  further  you  move  these
electrons  over  the  wire,  the  fewer  of  them  reach  the  other  end  of
the  wire,  unlike  you  putting  a  gallon  of  oil  in  the  pipeline  1,000
miles away, you get a gallon of oil. You put electrons in a wire, and
if you are far enough away you get none of them out the other end
of  it.  So  I  am  having  trouble  understanding  why  we  are  focusing
on  these  large,  centralized  productions  rather  than  distributing
them widely over thousands of house roofs.

Mr.  ARVIZU.  Let  me  start.  I  think  our  infrastructure  today  is
based  on  a  concept  of  big  power  plants,  big  wires,  and  so  a  lot  of
it  has  to  do  with,  so  how  do  we  assimilate  into  the  infrastructure
of  today.  There  is  actually  a  cost  issue,  the  larger  scale  and  cer-
tainly  in  the  case  of  concentrating  solar  power,  one  can  make  the
case  that  there  is  actually  better  economics  if  you  aggregate  large
scale,  put  this  thing  all  centrally  located.  There  is  a  value  of  dis-
tributed  generation,  which  I  think  is  to  your  point  that  I  think  we
probably  miss  and  don’t  fully  appreciate,  and  to  a  large  degree  we
kind  of  discriminate  against  distributed  generation  because  it  is
difficult  to  hang  those  onto  the  grid  today.  We  do  need  an  intel-
ligent grid. We need a grid that can accommodate a distributed set
of  generation  facilities  but  it  is  more  difficult  today  to  do  that.  I
think  ultimately  we  get  to  a  point  where  I  think  distributed  gen-
eration is valued at perhaps a premium as opposed—because it al-
lows you lots of other flexibilities. But in today’s environment, cen-
tral  station  power  is  what  utilities  like,  and  when  you  start—you
are  talking  about  RPSs  and  those  things  as  we  have  in  Colorado.
The way you get there most quickly is large solar farms, large wind
farms,  and  that  is  the  kind  of  thing  that  people  are  looking  at.  I
think  ultimately  we  will  get  to,  I  think,  the  broader  question  that
you are asking, which is the value of distributed generation.

NET METERING

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you.  Unless  you  are  producing  more  elec-
tricity  this  month  than  you  use,  don’t  you  automatically  have  net
metering? If you take the meter out and reverse it, you run it back-
wards.  So  if  you—that  is  why  they  put  a  seal  on  it,  by  the  way,
so  you  can’t  do  that.  Don’t  you  automatically  have  net  metering
whether the power company wants it or not if you have solar pan-
els on your roof?

59

Mr.  RESCH.  No,  you  do  not.  It  depends  entirely  on  your  meter.
If  you  have  your  standard  spinning  meter,  the  answer  is  yes,  you
have  the  capability  of  net  metering,  but  it  is  entirely  dependent
upon  the  law  of  that  state.  Each  state  has  different  net  metering
laws. In some cases you might spin it backwards and they are only
going to pay you wholesale electricity prices rather than retail elec-
tricity  prices.  In  some  cases  they  are  going  to  charge  you  a  sur-
charge  for  transmission  and  distribution.  It  differs  by  state,  every
state.

RELIABILITY OF SOLAR ENERGY

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  have  a  question—we  need  to  standardize  that,
of  course,  but  I  have  a  question  about  grid  tie  and  reliability.  I
have  a  wind  machine  I  put  up  and  I  find  out  that  it  is  a  grid-tie
wind  machine  and  it  has  to  see  120  or  it  won’t  produce  any  elec-
tricity. As soon as it stops seeing 120, it stops producing electricity.
Now, I understand the reason for that is you don’t want to electro-
cute  the  poor  lineman  who  has  come  to  fix  the  wire  because  you
are still pumping juice into it after it is down, but just when I need
it most, it is not there. Wouldn’t you think that we would be inter-
ested in some backup wherever you have solar panels on your roof,
and shouldn’t we have systems where you can now isolate yourself
from the grid and produce electricity for yourself with some storage
on site? Just when I need it most, now it is not there.

Mr. RESCH. I think you are seeing significant advancements cer-
tainly  in  the  private  sector,  also  the  National  Renewable  Energy
Laboratory  (NREL)  with  respect  to  storage  technologies  so  your
typical  lead  acid  batteries,  your  car  batteries  are  your  best  option
today.  I  think  within  a  couple  of  years  you  will  see  some  very  so-
phisticated  storage  technologies  at  a  much  lower  price  that  allow
you to do that, sir.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Even  if  I  have  the  storage  facility,  my  wind  ma-
chine  stops  working  when  it  doesn’t  see  120,  or  240.  It  just  quits.
Mr.  RESCH.  I  am  afraid  that  is  a  subject  for  another  panel.  This

is just a solar group.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  When  you  talk  of  turning  that  off,  I  understand
the  need  for  it.  You  don’t  want  to  be  pumping  electricity  into  the
wire when the lineman thinks it is dead so you are going to electro-
cute  him.  I  understand  that.  But  you  need  a  way  to  isolate  your
home so you still can run your freezer and have lights and so forth
when the power is off, don’t you?

Dr.  ARVIZU.  You  do,  and  there  is  power  electronics  that  we  are
now working on to solve those kinds of problems so that it is much
more  user  friendly.  We  have  not  really  focused  on  those  stand-
alone power applications as effectively as we can or should have be-
cause  other  things  have  taken  priority  but  we  are  working  on
those.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you.
Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.

SOLAR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAM

ing, and people are really interested obviously. They come out there
to  get  out  of  the  cold  and  the  rain  and  the  snow  and  people  want
to  take  advantage  of,  you  know,  the  wonderful  sunlight  we  have.
So in terms of this training, what kind of skill shortage do you pre-
dict  in  the  future  related  to  solar  installation  and  maintenance
with  this  increased  demand,  and  can  this  legislation  address  this
looming  shortage?  And  also  if  the  two  of  you  would  address  the
question on whether or not we have communities with these train-
ing  programs  that  have  actually  seen  an  improvement  in  terms  of
the quality of the installers of the solar panels.

Ms.  WEISSMAN.  Thank  you  for  the  question,  Madam  Chair.  I
think  without  a  doubt,  you  know,  what  we  are  starting  with,  our
goal  here  is  to  have  a  strong  market.  In  order  to  have  a  strong
market, we need to have qualified installers. We need to make sure
that  consumer  confidence  is  ensured,  that  you  pay  the  money  that
you are paying for a system that is installed properly and that you
don’t have to come back for service calls or for fixing the initial in-
stallation. In order to get to that point, you need training to make
sure that we have a good installer population as well as good prod-
uct  to  put  out  on  the  roof  or  in  the  field.  We  are  certainly  finding
that those installers that go through the North American Board of
Certified  Energy  Producers  (NABCEP)  certification  program  are
demonstrating  a  higher  level  of  quality  of  installation.  Now,  that
does  not  mean  that  people  who  are  not  NABCEP  certified  are  not
qualified.  I  don’t  want  to  imply  that.  But  we  are  finding  that  hav-
ing  to  go  through  the  NABCEP  credentialing  process  really  takes
a  hard  look  at  some  of  the  most  important  issues  including  famili-
arity  with  the  national  electrical  code,  making  sure  that—you
know, understanding orientation, understanding attachment to the
roof,  understanding  wiring,  understanding  all  the  different  major
tasks and subtasks that are necessary to do a competent job so that
we  are  finding  that  what  the  NABCEP  certification  program  is
doing is not only certifying and making sure that we have qualified
workers  but  we  are  making  sure  that  the  training  is  set  to  those
standards  to  make  sure  that  they  know  what  they  are  doing,  and
I  think  that  what  NABCEP  has  done  in  addition  to  elevating  the
workforce, it has also increased the need for good training and edu-
cation.  And  we  get  calls  all  the  time,  we  get  e-mails  all  the  time,
where  can  I  get  training  so  I  can  become  NABCEP  certified.  So
what we are seeing is that not only is the credential a great signal
to  consumers  but  it  is  also  increasing  the  need  for  better  training.
Mr. SARUBBI. If I could add to my colleague Jane here, New York
State  Energy  Research  Development  Authority  (NYSERDA)  has
tied  their  incentive  package  to  people  who  are  certified,  NABCEP
certified.  So  at  least  the  homeowners  who  are  reaping  the  benefits
of  this  incentive  are  at  least  assured  that  they  are  getting  it  from
a  certified  installer,  so  that  is  helping  improve  the  standards.  And
as  Jane  mentioned,  we  are  getting  a  lot  of  phone  calls  for  training
in Hudson Valley with the sponsorship of the Interstate Renewable
Energy  Council  (IREC)  as  well  as  NYSERDA  are  doing  national
electrical  code  training  seminars,  you  know,  for  the  electrical  in-
spectors  out  there  but  also  building  inspectors.  We  are  doing  spe-

have  to  go  out  and  approve  in  the  community.  So  that  in  itself  is
helping  the  standards  increase  alone.  And  it  is  amazing.  We  had
a  web  site  put  up  just  a  few  months  ago  as  we  were  getting  our
solar  program  off  the  ground  and  the  amount  of  hits  that  we  are
getting on that web site, you know, showing the interest, you know,
from  the  community  out  there  is  tremendous  and  I  am  getting
nervous from the amount of e-mails that I am receiving on a daily
basis  from  people  who  are  interested  in  the  training,  either  to  re-
ceive  the  training  or  homeowners  who  are  interested  in  actually
have  somebody  who  is  certified,  you  know,  to  be  able  to  install  it,
so  they  are  coming  to  Hudson  Valley.  That  is  where  they  looking
for  that  information  because  they  are  going  out  in  the  web:  who
can  I  get  to  come  install  a  nice  solar  system  on  the  house  that  I
know  it  is  going  to  be  a  credibly  installed  system  and  it  is  going
to be—you know, meet all the standards of industry. So we are see-
ing that growth.

Ms. GIFFORDS. The Chair recognizes Mr. Udall.

MORE ON SOLAR WORKFORCE TRAINING

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  wanted  to  come  and
hear  from  the  panel  today.  This  is  an  area,  as  you  all  know,  of
great fascination but also great potential. I also wanted to show my
solidarity  with  Dr.  Arvizu,  who  heads  up  the  National  Renewable
Energy Laboratory, which is in part located in my district in Colo-
rado. This is such an exciting time for us I think as a country and
as  a  broad  industry.  In  Colorado  we  recently  passed  Amendment
37, which put a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in place for the
State of Colorado, and I took advantage of that opportunity. I now
have  a  three  and  one  half  kilowatt  system  on  my  roof.  It  is  fun  to
make electricity and at the right time of day to go out and see the
meter  running  backwards  and  knowing  that  you  are  not  only  re-
ducing  your  own  bill  but  you  are  putting  some  power  back  on  the
grid.  So  I  want  to  thank  the  Chairwoman  for  holding  this  really,
really important hearing and giving us the opportunity as Members
of Congress not only to learn more about what the potential is but
also what we can do to help provide greater incentives. Having ar-
rived late, I don’t know all the questions that have been asked but
I am curious, given the great team that came to install the system
on  my  home,  what  sorts  of  stories  that  the  panel  has  heard  both
positive and in some cases negative about workers without training
attempting  to  install  solar  panels.  I  don’t  know  who  would  be  best
to speak to that question. Ms. Weissman?

Ms. WEISSMAN. Thank you, Congressman. Well, there are always
stories  to  tell,  and  I  think  that  we  were  finding  problems.  We  are
seeing  the  problems.  You  know,  shading  is  a  big  issue.  Certainly
in some parts of the country with, you know, the trees, a small tree
today  could  be  a  big  tree  tomorrow  and  so  are  seeing  that  those,
you  know,  installers  who  are  not  properly  trained  are  not,  you
know,  realizing  that  shading  is  a  real  issue,  and  if  they  don’t  see
the  tree  and  the  leaves  and  even  the  trees  in  the  winter  when
there  are  no  leaves  in  certain  parts  of  this  country  that  this  will
be  a  problem.  Most  states  do  require  that  a  licensed  electrician  do
the final hookup of the system, and we think that is great and that
is  how  it  should  be,  but  what  we  are  also  finding  is  that  different

trades  who  know  their  trade  very  well  may  not  know  solar  very
well, and so certainly training is very important on the actual, you
know,  the  characteristics  of  solar  and  the  technology  and  what  is
needed  to  put  up  a  good  system.  So  what  we  are  finding  and  you
know,  what  we  are  seeing  now  too  with  more  incentives  going  on
both  at  the  State  level  and  the  federal  level,  is  what  we  want  to
prevent  is  any  guy  or  gal  with  a  truck  and  a  ladder  to  think  they
can  put  this  stuff  up  on  the  roof.  That  is  not  true.  You  know,  it
is  going  to  be  a  problem.  So  that  even  those  people  that  may  feel
that  they  are  doing  a  good  job  may  in  fact  not  be.  It  was  inter-
esting,  when  we  started  NABCEP,  the  certification  program,  we
had  a  lot  of  the  old  timers  say,  you  know,  I  am  not  going  to  take
a  test,  I  know  what  I  have  been  doing,  I  have  been  doing  this  for
20 years, grandfather me in, and we said absolutely not; we are not
going  to  give  you  a  seal  of  approval.  You  know,  if  you  know  what
you  are  doing,  you  are  going  to  pass  this  four-hour  exam  and,  you
know,  that  will  show  proof  that  we  can  give  you  the  certification
mark. So we are pretty serious in terms of making sure that if we
are  going  to  certify  somebody,  they  know  what  they  are  doing  and
prevent  some  of  the  stories  that  we  have  heard  or  that  we  have
seen,  some  of  the  mistakes  that  have  been  made,  some  of  the  stu-
pid  mistakes  that  have  been  made  out  in  the  field.  What  we  want
to  make  sure  is  customers  are  going  to  get,  you  know,  a  well-run
system that is going to last a long time.

Mr.  RESCH.  And  just  to  add  one  other  comment.  The  IBEW  has
done,  I  think  an  excellent  job  in  training  in  certain  key  markets
but  starting  to  go  national  training  their  members  to  certify  and
install  solar  systems  in  an  appropriate  manner.  So  I  think  that—
when you start to see that shift where you have large trade unions,
where  you  have,  you  know,  large  roofer  groups  starting  to  reach
out and train and educate and, if you will, give them new skill sets,
I  think  that  is  a  fundamental  sea  change  in  the  capability  of  in-
stallers  going  forward.  Certainly  linking  with  Jane’s  program  at
NABCEP is absolutely critical as well.

Ms.  WEISSMAN.  But  if  I  can  just  add  onto  Mr.  Resch’s  comment,
the  International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  (IBEW)  and
the  National  Joint  Apprenticeship  and  Training  Committee
(NJATC)  do  sit  on  the  board  of  directors  of  the  North  American
Board  of  Certified  Energy  Practitioners  so  we  have  been  very  in-
volved  with  the  union  from  day  one.  In  addition,  the  NJATC,  the
training  arm  for  the  IBEW,  just  published  a  fantastic  textbook  on
photovoltaic systems which I know that a lot of the community col-
leges are beginning to use as their main learning tool.

Mr. UDALL. I see my time has expired. If the Chairwoman would

indulge me for 30 more seconds?

Speaking to your comment about shading not only with leaves on
trees  but  the  tree  branches  themselves,  that  was  one  of  the  proc-
esses we had to go through. We had a big old cottonwood tree that
was  blocking  at  certain  times  of  the  day  the  system,  and  I  found
out  in  the  process  of  installing  the  system  that  if  you  have  any
shading  on  any  part  of  the  system,  it  affects  the  overall  system  in
very dramatic ways. So we had to make the decision. It was almost
like  letting  go  of  your  firstborn  child,  taking  down  this  tree,  but  I
was  convinced  that  taking  down  the  tree  was  worth  the  pain  be-

cause  of  the  benefits  that  you  accrue,  and  I  was  told  that  taking
down  the  tree  but  at  the  same  time  installing  the  system  was  the
equivalent of planting 100 more trees. So I hope that sales job was
accurate. This was a learning process for myself and my family.

I  thank  the  Chairwoman  for  her  indulgence  and  for  holding  this
very, very important hearing. These technologies and what our eco-
nomic future will involve. It is also about energy security and about
environmental benefits, so this is very, very important. Thank you.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Inglis.
Mr.  HAYDEN.  Could  I  add  to  some  of  those  comments,  Madam
Chair?  Some  comments  have  been  made  including  yours  just  now
which  I  would  like  to  kind  of  try  to—understanding  though  that
the  issues  that  we  are  running  into  about  the  shading,  the  tree,
distributed—point up that there is need for more than one piece of
the solar solution and the distributed solution that has a lot of pub-
lic  popularity  has  its  limits  that  are  important  for  us  to  overcome
to get a large percentage of our energy to come from solar. For ex-
ample, we have our solar test site in Tempe, Arizona, and I can tell
you that the college students that live in the condos and the urban
area,  they  do  not  have  the  option  of  having  solar  on  their  roof.  I
live  in  Tempe,  and  even  though  I  work  on  solar,  my  solar  panels
are  with  APS’s  site  at  Prescott,  Arizona,  and  the  reason  is,  as  an
engineer I know that they are far more productive than they would
be  on  my  roof,  and  that  is  important  to  me.  If  I  am  going  to  see
a  lot  of  our  resources  put  into  a  very  important  solar  panel  and
also find storage options, I don’t want to see them wasted in an im-
perfect  application.  So  to  address  some  of  the  points  made,  there
is—about 85 percent of the energy that comes from a Four Corners
power plant makes it to the customer in Phoenix. The highest frac-
tion  of  that  energy  goes  over  the  wires.  The  wires  are  very  good
at delivering energy. So even though we do see the value of rooftop
solar,  it  certainly  won’t  get  us  to  the  40  percent-type  number  that
solar  I  think  could  get  if  we  are  allowed  to  build  larger  facilities
that  are  more  efficient,  bring  the  power  in  to  where  it  is  needed,
and secondly, to bring in the storage technologies that would allow
the  utility  to  help  provide  that  backup  power  that  otherwise  these
panels  can’t  do  on  their  own.  So  it  underscores  I  think  one  of  the
values  of  this  discussion  is  that  it  is  not  a  one  size,  one  solution
fits  all.  If  we  want  mainstream  America  to  use  solar,  we  have  got
to make it easy. We can’t just make it for us environmentally moti-
vated folks to be the only ones using solar. Thank you.

EFFICIENCY OF SOLAR ENERGY

Mr. INGLIS. A follow-up on that. If the efficiency of the conversion
were  higher,  it  would  make  the  distributed  more  attractive,  right?
Mr.  HAYDEN.  No,  not  at  all.  The  efficiency  is  a  good  parameter
but the fluctuation is the issue that talks about reliability. In fact,
when  we  build  a  project  of  any  size,  we  have  to  look  at  the  reli-
ability on customers. The Congressman talked about the wind sys-
tem  tripping.  That  also  affects  things  like  your  power  electronics,
manufacturing businesses, power quality. So if you do have an effi-
cient  system  that  is  good  for  its  economics  but  there  will  be  inter-
ruptions  from  clouds.  There  will  be  interruptions  for  other  reasons
and we have to match the load.

STORAGE FOR SOLAR ENERGY

Mr.  INGLIS.  Which  brings  me  to  the  other  question  which  is
about the storage issue which, from what I have been hearing this
morning,  is  crucial.  It  seems  that  the  section  of  the  bill—sections
of the bill dealing with that are relatively brief. Is there something
else  we  should  be  saying  in  those  sections  about  storage  besides
what we are saying here?

Mr.  HAYDEN.  We  discussed  that  before.  We  provided  testimony
on  that  very  subject  because  we  see  more  than  just  the  thermal
being  possible  storage  solutions.  The  thermal  is  worth  mentioning
because in the case of certain technologies, thermal is very directly
used but there is other proven large-scale solar technology for stor-
age—I  am  sorry—storage  technologies  such  as  compressed  air  en-
ergy  storage,  other  things  that  while  we  are  all  waiting  and  work-
ing on the new batteries, there are things that can be done sort of
on a regional basis.

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  suppose  these  battery  breakthroughs  really  could
also  be  the—I  mean,  there  are  a  number  of  things  that  if  they
broke could make it so that there—if we had the breakthroughs in
a  various  number  of  areas,  you  would  have  wide  scale—more  use
of the resource, right?

Dr. ARVIZU. There is no question about that. Storage has contin-
ued, as I call it, to be the Achilles heel of renewable energy in gen-
eral. If we just had a better storage system—we have been working
on batteries for a very long time, literally, you know, decades. And
progress is slow. Progress—we are making progress but progress is
slow,  and  I  think  ultimately,  you  know,  converting  wind  and  the
other  intermittent  type  of  resources  to  some  sort  of  energy  carrier
like  hydrogen  or  compressed  air,  whatever  it  might  be,  is  really
going  to  change  the  economic  equation  considerably.  I  know  I  sit
on  the  National  Science  Board  and  we  are  doing  things  for—actu-
ally  trying  to  provide  power  at  the  South  Pole  while  we  are  doing
some fairly energy-intensive experiments, and what are looking for
stand-alone  systems  that  are  not  polluting,  because  right  now  we
have  got—we  are  polluting  in  the  southern  hemisphere  because  of
all  the  diesel  fuel  that  we  are  using  down  there.  And  we  are  look-
ing  for,  you  know,  some  of  these  advanced  concepts  that  down
there  you  would  pay  an  exorbitant  amount  of  money  for  that  par-
ticular  application  and  there  are  some  things—we  are  looking  at
how  can  you  convert  wind  energy  to  hydrogen  and  to  use  it  when
you essentially—when the wind doesn’t blow or solar energy to hy-
drogen  or  a  variety  of  other  technologies  and  things,  and  I  think
ultimately you need to look at that whole system’s architecture. So
you  need  to  look  at  them  in  the  broadest  context.  You  know,  I  am
very  bullish  on  the  fact  of  zero-energy  buildings.  We  use  more  en-
ergy  in  buildings  than  in  most  any  other  application  that  we  have
and  so  the  distributed  value  on  a  building  that  is  efficiently  de-
signed  with  its  own  power  generation  source  and  its  own  storage
has great value and benefit. At the systems level, is it still a little
bit  costly  although  we  are  making  huge  progress  and  we  have  got
examples  of  Habitat  for  Humanity  homes  that  generate  more  en-
ergy  that  they  consume,  and  so  it  can  be  done  on  a  modest  build-
ing,  and  it  is  a  matter  of  changing  a  variety  of  things.  It  is  what

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

65

we  talked  about  earlier,  bring  the  price  signal  where  the  decisions
are  being  made.  You  know,  construction  for  buildings  is  not
incentivized to save energy. And so all those things need to be part
of the package and I think we need to look more holistically at the
whole issue.

CONVERSION TO HYDROGEN

Mr. INGLIS. To the objection I hear, and when I talk about hydro-
gen, about why convert, just out of curiosity, it is not exactly a sub-
ject of this hearing but why convert to hydrogen in those cases you
talked  about,  particularly  at  the  Poles  where  Dr.  Bartlett  and  I
saw the same thing you are talking about, diesel fuel being brought
in  belching  out  the  smokestacks  when  we  got  a  lot  of  wind  and  a
solar there.

Dr.  ARVIZU.  The  why  convert  part  is  because  it  really  is  an  ele-
gant solution. You don’t pollute anything, obviously. You convert—
you know, you change water to hydrogen and oxygen and then you
use  the  energy  and  it  converts  back  to  water.  It  is  very  costly  at
this  point  and  that  is  the  reason  that  we  don’t  do  it  more,  you
know, uniformly elsewhere. But in that particular environment, the
cost  that  you  pay  for  the  energy  of  transporting  fossil  fuel  down
there  is  exorbitant  and  there  is  just  no  reason  why  you  wouldn’t
in terms of economics do the thing that is less environmentally in-
sulting than the other thing.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you.
Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. Thank you.

MORE ON SOLAR CHECK-OFF PROGRAM

Mr. Resch, you know, as in some other fields, global warming, for
instance, everybody talks about the cost and the fears and the pro-
jections  and  predictions  and  all  but  most  of  those  people  that  are
recommending that we just go all out on global warming fail to talk
about cost. They shy away from that. They don’t want to talk about
who  has  to  go  by  the  cash  register  at  a  time  when  China  is  pol-
luting  on  an  increasing  ratio  with  coal.  So  I  will  ask  you  some-
thing. How about the industry? Has anyone expressed any concern
about  planning  the  assessment,  and  will  this  result  in  increased
cost to the consumer? I don’t see how you can keep from it, but you
would  have  to  answer  that.  And  how  much  would  the  assessment
be  and  how  is  it  going  to  be  done,  case-by-case  basis  or  individ-
ually?

Mr. RESCH. Thank you for your question, and with respect to the
check-off  program,  I  think  there  is  initially  concern  about  what  is
the right way to structure it, where do you assess within the solar
stream,  how  far  upstream,  how  far  downstream,  do  you  assess  at
the  installer  or  do  you  assess  at  the  manufacturer,  should  it  in-
clude all equipment, should it just include PV modules, what about
solar  water  heating.  There  are  a  lot  of  questions  and  I  think  good
questions  that  need  to  be  resolved  and  I  think  the  way  this  pro-
gram  is  structured  is,  it  has  flexibility,  that  all  the  rules  are  not
set  in  stone,  that  there  is  an  opportunity  to  adjust  the  rate  or  de-
termine an appropriate rate that would actually produce an appro-

priate  amount  of  money  that,  you  know,  first  the  industry  is  will-
ing  to  spend  and  raise  and  that  it  doesn’t  penalize  the  consumer
or penalize the manufacturer to the greatest extent. So, you know,
I  would  say  we  don’t  have  all  the  answers  but  part  of  that  is  the
discussion  with  the  Department  of  Energy  and  getting  the  board
together  to  determine  what  is  the  right  level  and  just  make  sure
all the right players are involved. I mean, we have a couple of sug-
gestions in our written testimony for improvements to the program
and  I  think  what  you  will  find  is  that  most  or  all  of  the  manufac-
turers  will  agree  that  what  is  needed  is  a  campaign  along  these
lines.  They  may  disagree  on  timing  when  that  program  should  be
in  place  but  all  of  them  want  to  participate  and  make  sure  they
have a voice in the development of that program.

Mr.  HALL.  Well,  we  got  airliners  that,  all  except  Southwest,  are
going  broke  flying  full  and  going  broke  because  of  fuel  and  they
have to turn to the consumer. You might hear in the city of Wash-
ington  the  cab  drivers  I  think  at  midnight  last  night  increased
their  minimum  fee  to  $2.50  instead  of  $1.50.  That  has  gone  up  al-
most  50  percent.  How  are  we  going  to  keep  the  assessment  from
going to the consumer? Why wouldn’t it?

Mr.  RESCH.  Well,  there  is  two  ways  to  look  at  it,  one  of  which
is  that  as  there  is  more  competition,  there  is  a  lot  more  pressure
on  the  price  downward,  and  when  you  look  at  the  oil  and  gas  in-
dustry  other  than  propane,  they  shy  away  from  any  kind  of  struc-
ture along these lines because it actually goes back to the producer,
that  the  costs  are  passed  back  to  the  producer,  not  onto  the  con-
sumer because the consumer is only willing to spend so much, and
what  we  have  really  seen  in  the  solar  industry  in  the  last  couple
of  years  is  increased  competition,  increased  competition  to  put
cheaper  panels.  They  are  scaling  up  manufacturing.  Prices  are
coming  down.  You  know,  feedstock  materials  are  starting  to  in-
crease  in  supply  and  again  putting  downward  pressure  on  the
price.  It  is  unclear.  I  mean,  I  think  if  you  were  to  step  back  with
an  economist,  you  would  have  one—two  economists,  one  of  them
would  say  it  is  going  to  be  passed  on  to  the  consumer,  the  other
would say that the manufacturers will absorb the cost. But I think
what  we  are  looking  for,  you  know,  is  a  level  of  assessment  that
is  small  enough  so  that  it  is  not  a  major  hit  on  either  side,  the
manufacturer’s  side  or  the  installer’s  side  but  yet  collectively  as
this industry grows, we can use those resources to educate the pub-
lic on the benefits of solar energy.

Mr. HALL. To be continued?
Mr. RESCH. To be continued. Absolutely.
Mr. HALL. Let me ask the panel, if I have some more time here.
The  language  of  the  bill  provides  for  criminal  penalties  for  release
of  information  obtained  under  the  authority  of  the  Act  to  ‘‘any
agency  or  officer  of  the  United  States  for  any  purpose  other  than
implementation  of  this  Act.’’  What  information  do  you  think  they
are  seeking  to  protect  here?  What  is  being  protected,  and  do  you
agree that criminal penalties are necessary?

Mr. RESCH. Well, I think a lot of it is confidential business infor-
mation  and,  you  know,  I  think  that  part  of  that  provision  you  are
referring  to  goes  back  to  the  hey,  you  know,  we  need  you  to  open
your  books  in  order  for  us  to  make  sure  that  what  you  are  report-

ing  to  us  is  accurate  if  you  are  participating  in  this  program  and
that  if  that  information  leaks  out-a  lot  of  it  is  CBI  that  you  would
want  to  make  sure  that  companies  are  comfortable  with  the  gov-
ernment  looking  into  their  books  with  respect  to  confidential  busi-
ness information, if I am referring to the section of the bill that you
are.

Mr. HALL. It is a mandatory program?
Mr.  RESCH.  It  is  a  mandatory  program  that  companies  can  opt

Mr.  HALL.  And  it  is  pretty  strong  language,  ‘‘any  agency  or  offi-
cer,’’ that provides for criminal penalties. That is pretty strong. Do
you agree that criminal penalties are necessary?

Mr. RESCH. I think that what——
Mr. HALL. You may not have an opinion.
Mr.  RESCH.  This  program  is  modeled  after  the  existing  agri-
culture programs and, you know, what I would say is, certainly we
can  discuss  the  right  way  to  ensure  compliance  and  maybe  that  is
an  overly  aggressive  way  and  maybe  the  way  it  works  in  agri-
culture  shouldn’t—you  know,  we  shouldn’t  be  doing  it  in  energy.
But  I  would  say  this  is  modeled  after  existing  programs.  So  it
seems  to  have  worked  previously  but  certainly  there  is  opportuni-
ties to modify it if necessary.

Mr.  HALL.  My  time  is  up.  There  is  a  lot  more  we  could  discuss,

but I can do that with you by letter. I thank you.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Hall.

MORE ON SOLAR CHECK-OFF PROGRAM

And Mr. Resch, just to clarify, how many other programs are out
there  that  we  are  looking  at?  I  know  we  talked  about  milk,  we
talked about beef.

Mr.  RESCH.  There  are  17  programs  right  now  between  energy

and agriculture that are promotion programs along these lines.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  And  have  there  been  problems  with  companies
and  confidentiality  and  issues  like  this  in  the  past  that  we  know
of?

Mr. RESCH. I would have to get back to you on that. I don’t have
specific  examples.  I  imagine  that  they  are  consistently  written  in
the  same  manner  in  order  to  address  concerns  that  have  been
raised in the past but I am not entirely sure.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Hall, we will get back to you on that because

I am curious as well.

Mr. Bartlett.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  would  just  like  to  note
that  if  there  were  an  unending  succession  of  ANWRs  and  we  were
willing to pay the price for sequestering the CO2, we wouldn’t need
to  be  talking  about  solar,  would  we?  But  the  reality  is  that  there
is  not  an  unending  succession  of  ANWRs.  I  have  ten  kids,  15
grandkids and two great-grandkids, and wouldn’t it be nice if I left
them  a  little  energy  for  their  future,  which  is  one  of  the  reasons
I  won’t  vote  to  drill  in  ANWR  until  they  commit  to  me  they  are
going  to  use  all  the  energy  from  ANWR  to  invest  in  alternatives
because  today  we  have  no  surplus  energy  to  invest  in  alternatives
or oil wouldn’t be $69 a barrel, right?

I  would  also  like  to  note  that  unless  you  are  making  hydrogen
from  a  non-fossil  fuel,  using  hydrogen  probably  results  in  a  larger
carbon footprint than not using it unless you are going to use it in
a fuel cell, which we don’t yet have because you will always get less
energy from the less hydrogen that you get from the energy source
in  which  you  produced  it.  If  that  is  a  fossil  fuel,  obviously  burning
hydrogen in a reciprocating engine is going to leave a larger carbon
footprint than if you hadn’t used the original fuel. Just noting how
we are creatures of habit, I was at the South Pole twice in the last
five  years.  For  six  months  the  sun  shines  all  day,  every  day  and
the  wind  never  stops  blowing,  and  we  create  essentially  all  of  our
power there from flown-in diesel. Now, is that dumb? We are really
creatures of habit, aren’t we?

You  know,  the  sun  is  93  million  miles  away.  I  have  a  place  in
West  Virginia.  My  friends  are  amazed  that  I  make  ice  from  the
sun. I have a Sun Frost refrigerator hooked up. But I put my first
solar  panels  on  the  roof.  I  have  153  acres.  They  said,  why  in  the
devil  are  you  doing  that.  You  know,  the  sun  is  93  million  miles
away.  If  I  put  it  on  the  roof  or  on  the  ground  beside  the  building,
it  makes  no  difference  as  far  as  the  sun  is  concerned.  It  is  very
much  cheaper  and  easier  to  put  it  down  on  the  ground.  So  unless
you  are  in  a  subdivision  and  have  got  to  put  it  on  your  roof,  don’t
put  it  on  your  roof.  It  is  a  whole  lot  easier  to  maintain  on  the
ground.  A  big  cost,  a  big  part  of  the  cost  of  putting  in  these  solar
panels  is  just  the  carpentry  or  whatever  you  want  to  call  it  to
mount  these  things,  and  you  don’t  need  to  have  some  guy  do  that,
you know. The Home Depot has a great slogan, ‘‘You can do it. We
can  help.’’  We  need  to  be  telling  these  people  how  to  mount  it.  I
don’t  have  any  problem  with  a  certified  electrician  hooking  up  the
power. Wiring them and hooking it is a very small part of the cost
of putting them in, and you don’t need to have somebody come put
it in. If you can change a faucet washer, you can install solar pan-
els.  It  really  isn’t  that  tough.  So  I  would  just  encourage  you,  you
don’t need to further increase the cost of putting these in. You can
do it; we can help, and we need some help out there like, you know,
you don’t put it where it is going to be shaded and so forth.

MORE ON STORAGE FOR SOLAR

Let  me  ask  you  a  question  about  storage.  Isn’t  it  true  that  for
these large facilities, it is hard to beat the battery that never fails,
which is—unless you have to replace the pump or the turbine. Why
don’t we just pump water uphill and then let it flow back when we
need  the  energy?  Isn’t  that  about  as  good  a  battery  as  we  can  get
with about as high efficiency as any battery we have got?

Mr. HAYDEN. Simple answer, yes.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  Yes.  If  the  project  permits  it,  why  shouldn’t  we

be doing that everywhere?

Mr.  HAYDEN.  Well,  everywhere  including  desert  climates  where
water  is—Arizona  is  an  example  where  it  is  done  today  on  hydro
plants that exist. Creating a new hydro plant just for that purpose
would require a high reservoir, a low reservoir, water, et cetera. So
those  are  the  practical  issues.  I  do  recognize  pumped  hydros  being
a  very  excellent  efficient  solution  when  you  can  do  it.  Compressed
air  is  another  one  that  we  are  looking  at  it  because  it  has  similar

favorable attributes, different implementation. But in terms of Ari-
zona  as  an  example,  most  of  the  lakes,  water  flows  downhill  so
there are those places where it has been done, Roosevelt Lake and
others,  I  believe,  but  I  think  that  in  terms  of  creating  new  lakes
just for that purpose, that would be quite a challenge on the water
side.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  There  are  a  lot  of  places  where  the  topography

and the water available——

Mr.  HAYDEN.  If  I  may,  I  know  that  those  discussions  have  been
taken to the dam operators and they have had challenges in terms
of their most economical operation of that asset. So you would have
to take that question to some of the existing dam operators.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  would  just  like  to  note  that  if  you  don’t  have
electricity,  the  thing  you  miss  the  most  is  lights,  and  it  is  very
easy,  and  I  would  encourage—I  would  hope  that  we  would  encour-
age  people  if  they  are  putting  in  a  stand-alone  system  that  they
use  direct  current  lights.  You  don’t  need  an  inverter.  It  is  really
simple. You have a solar panel and you have lights, and if they are
direct current, they work, and there is really nothing to fail. So the
first  thing  you  miss  in  your  home  when  the  electricity  goes  off  is
the  lights  go  off,  and  if  you  are  looking  at  those  things  that  make
life comfortable, you know, being able to see and have lights is very
essential, and that is pretty much a failsafe system if you have di-
rect  current,  DC.  If  you  have  120  volts,  you  got  that  really  com-
plicated  inverter  full  of—I  don’t  trust  computers  in  these  little
things. They may or may not work. The lead acid battery works all
the  time,  doesn’t  it?  And  you  don’t  need  anything  in  between  the
battery and your 12-volt or 24-volt or 48-volt valise on your fluores-
cent lights, do you? It is a very efficient use of electricity and very
failsafe,  and  I  think  more  people  ought  to  be  encouraged  to  put
those  in,  and  that  is  so  you  can  see  your  way  around  the  house
when the lights go out, right?

Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.

WATER USE FOR CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER

We don’t have a tremendous amount of time left and I would like
the  panel  to  focus  a  few  minutes  on  this  issue  of  water,  and  Mr.
Hayden, perhaps Dr. Arvizu as well. You know, obviously out west
we do have some real issues in terms of just not having the water.
We have got 25 million users on the Colorado River right now. We
are in a drought. We have increased demands of the current water
supply that we do have. So I am interested in terms of the require-
ments for a CSP plant. Can they be built to use air cooling instead
of  water  cooling  enabled  to  eliminate  the  water  requirements,  and
are  water  constraints  an  obstacle  to  the  wider  adoption  in  your
opinion of CSP technologies?

Mr.  HAYDEN.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  Yes,  water  is  an  issue.
It  is  one  of  the  issues  that  is  on  the  sequence  of  working  through
the  biggest  challenge  of  cost  just  to  get  us  started  which  fortu-
nately,  in  my  years  of  working  this,  I  see  a  lot  of  progress  right
now  so  I  am  happy  to  hear  that  we  are  starting  to  look  at  the
water, meaning that we are serious about this moving forward, and
it  is  absolutely  an  issue.  The  present  day  CSP  systems  use  water

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

for  cooling  to  about  the  extent  that  a  conventional  power  plant
does, and therefore it is acceptable in some views but we would like
to  do  better.  Obviously  a  lot  of  farmland  is  getting  converted  for
residential  largely  because  of  water  so  the  water  situation  is  not
static.  It  is  becoming  more  of  a  pressure.  So  in  every  sense  if  we
want  to  use  more  of  this  energy  technology,  reducing  water  use  is
important. In terms of the present-day designs, there is something
called  air  cooling  where  they  replace  the  water  evaporation  cycle
with  fans  and  just  move  the  air  through  a  radiator-type  structure.
That  can  be  done  today  but  it  wasn’t  the  economical  solution  for
the  present-day  installations.  It  is  available  today  but  we  would
like  our  cake  and  eat  it  too.  We  would  like  it  to  be  available  and
also  more  efficient  and  less  costly.  Secondly,  I  will  mention  that
other  concentrating  solar  power  technologies 
including  con-
centrated  photovoltaics,  dish  engine  technologies  don’t  use  water
cooling  at  all.  So  when  we  again  talk  about  CSP,  usually  we  are
talking  about  the  trough  technology  with  water  cooling  but  there
are  other  technology  solutions  that  will  compete  with  the  trough
and  so  a  trough  needs  to  try  to  move  itself  forward  with  water  re-
duction  and  at  the  same  time  these  other  technologies  might  come
forward  and  be  low-water-use  technologies.  In  fact,  we  sometimes
notice  how  little  water  is  valued  on  a  dollar  basis  and  yet  how
much it is valued on an emotional basis, and that sort of contradic-
tion  is  what  we  are  grappling  here  with  on  its  application  with
solar.

Dr.  ARVIZU.  If  I  could  add  just  a  little  bit  on  that.  Absolutely,  I
think  we  have  been  looking  at  technologies  that  really  don’t  use,
you  know,  any  water  that  is  not  self-contained  in  the  system.  You
know,  for  a  long  time,  I  can  remember  in  the  1980s  we  looked  at
a  variety  of  gas-cooled  reactors.  We  looked  at—we  have  actually
the best heat transfer medium for these concentrating thermal sys-
tems  is  typically  a  molten  salt  or  something  that  has  got  a  very
high specific heat to it. So you don’t have really a contained water
need  for  the  actual,  you  know,  working  end  of  those  particular
plants  and  there  are  ways  to  get  around  having  to  use  any  water
if  you  really  chose  to  do  that,  but  it  is  a  matter  of  economics.  It
is  a  matter  of  pushing  the  technology  and  making  it  most  cost-ef-
fective.  And  there  is  in  fact  as  Mr.  Hayden  says  this  whole  idea
that  you  can  put  concentrating  photovoltaics.  The  biggest  problem
with these concentrating systems, as I mentioned in my testimony,
is  the  upfront  capital  cost,  and  one  of  the  things  that  we  are  look-
ing  at  is  how  can  you  reduce  that  cost  dramatically  in  some  of
these concentrating—troughs in fact are some things that are being
pioneered right now in Australia that are I think very cost-effective
and  also  can  be  done  in  a  manner  that  is  very,  very  miserly  rel-
ative  to  the  water  use.  So  this  is  not  a  problem  that  I  believe  is
in  any  way  a  showstopper  or  couldn’t  be  overcome  but  for  the  will
and the R&D program that goes along with trying to stand up with
some pilots to make sure that it operates the way we think it ought
to.

CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  A  couple  other  questions,  because  I  know  we  are
running  out  of  time.  First  of  all,  APS,  Mr.  Hayden,  I  understood

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

71

took 14 years to construct the solar trough, 14 years, I think. Why
was  the  hiatus  so  long,  and  is  that  something  that  we  can  learn
from as well?

Mr.  HAYDEN.  Well,  the  proper  way  to  look  at  that  14  years  is,
no  one  had  done  it  in  14  years  and  we  chose  to  pursue  that,  and
I  will  give  you  a  pragmatic  answer.  I  have  been  going  to  DOE
meetings  for  all  my  career  and  having  the  solar  industry  run  up
and say buy 100-megawatt power plant and everything will be fine.
Now,  we  are  talking  about  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  when
they  do  that  and  we  under  a  regulated  structure  do  not  have  the
opportunity to just spend hundreds of millions of dollars that is not
least cost so what we chose to do was to challenge those solar com-
panies to make a small-scale plant just to prove that they could get
on their feet again because the present regime of folks making the
trough is not the same folks that built it decades ago and they ac-
tually  needed  to  give  a  new  start.  So  literally  when  they  built  our
first  megawatt,  it  was  all  of  a  sudden  kind  of  a  deer  in  the  head-
lights  moment  when  oh,  you  mean  we  really  have  to  build  this
thing, and they had fundamental decisions such as were they going
to  use  aluminum  or  were  they  going  to  use  steel,  who  were  they
going to get their tubes from. So fortunately, even though one one-
megawatt  is  a  very  small  project,  it  gave  them  the  opportunity  to
start getting it together, and then when they had the 64-megawatt
opportunity in Nevada, they had momentum. All I can say that we
did  was,  we  broke  the  ice.  We  didn’t  have  dollars  available  under
our  regulated  structure  to  buy  hundreds  of  megawatts  but  we  did
have the dollars available to break the ice.

MORE ON SOLAR WORKFORCE TRAINING

Ms. GIFFORDS. Before I turn to Mr. Inglis, Mr. Resch, if you could
address  Mr.  Bartlett’s  comments  about—and  I  know  he  had  to
leave—about  just  anyone  being  able  to  kind  of  put  on  these  solar
panels  and—I  mean,  I  am  not  an  expert  but  it  sounds—what  I
have seen is pretty complicated stuff.

Mr.  RESCH.  There  is  two  points  I  will  make  there.  First  is  that
Home Depot does sell solar panels in New Jersey and in California,
and  if  you  wanted  to  go  out  and  by  a  solar  system,  you  could  do
it.  Say  you  have  a  garden  shed  and  you  wanted  to  put  lights  up
in  the  back,  very  simple,  you  know,  something  you  could  do.  You
are  dealing  with  electricity  so  you  have  got  to  be  smart  about  it
and so you don’t want anybody—you don’t want your kids running
out  there  and  playing  around  with  it.  I  mean,  it  is  electricity.  But
when you really do step back and understand electricity, it is fairly
understandable.  Now,  he  is  referring  to  a  direct  current,  a  DC,
versus  what  we  actually  use  in  our  homes,  which  is  alternating
current,  so  it  gets  a  little  more  complicated.  You  have  more  equip-
ment.  I  decided  to  use  a  contractor  to  install  the  solar  system  in
my  house  because  I  don’t  want  to  climb  up  on  a  roof,  first  of  all.
Second  of  all,  I  don’t  really  understand  electricity  all  that  well  in
the  sense  of  how  I  install  it  in  my  home,  and  just  like  anything
else,  I  went  out  and  I  got  three  bids,  and  so  when  Congressman
Udall  was  talking  about  shading  and  all  the  rest,  well,  you  know,
there is a little bit of the buyer beware. You want to get three bids,
just  like  you  would  for  any  system.  When  you  install  an  air  condi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

72

tioning system in your house, a hot water heater, you are going to
get  a  couple  of  bids  and  then  find  out  which  one  is  the  best  and
which  one  seems  the  most  knowledgeable.  So  I  would  tend  to  say
that  we  are  not  quite  there  with  the  technology  to  say  it  is  plug
and  play,  any  consumer  could  go  out  and  just  quickly  install  it  on
their  house  with  respect  to  photovoltaics.  I  think  we  will  get  there
at some point in time. We are not there yet.

Mr.  SARUBBI.  Can  I  just  add  to  that?  Teaching  electricity  in  my
entire  career  and  former  electrician,  I  would  be  a  little  nervous  to
know that homeowners were going to go out on a regular basis and
install  systems,  you  know,  when  we  talk  about  grounding  needs,
when  we  start  talking  about  liability  because  the  first  time  there
is a fire at somebody’s house, the thing you hear most often is that
it  came  from  electricity,  it  was  an  electrical  problem.  So  we  cer-
tainly  don’t  want  to  create  that  environment  with  the  solar  indus-
try  where  people  are  going  to  Home  Depot  and  not  that  they  can’t
buy  that  small  type  of  system  but  if  I  am  going  to  be  putting  a
3KW,  seven  or  even  10KW  system  on  my  house,  I  want  to  know
that  it  is  installed  by  a  certified,  you  know,  company  that  I  have
got  longevity  with  that  system  and  so  I  would  be  a  little  leery
about  moving  in  that  direction  at  this  point  in  the  industry.  And
DC in reference to AC, converters today are so much more efficient
and  reliable,  you  know,  that  I  don’t  see  the  conversion  of  moving
to  DC,  you  know,  in  our  house,  direct  current  power  and  retro-
fitting  all  our  lights  for  that,  you  know,  environment,  as  opposed
to staying with alternating current just doesn’t make sense at this
point.

MORE ON SOLAR CHECK-OFF PROGRAM

Mr.  INGLIS.  Just  one  quick  follow-up.  We  were  talking  earlier
about the reporting requirements and the disclosure of information,
and  did  anybody  want  to  make  any  further  comments  about  that?
Is  there  something  about  the  disclosure  of  information  that  was  of
concern in previous programs, these 17 programs?

Dr.  ARVIZU.  I  am  not  exactly  sure  what  the  major  issues  were.
We are aware of some lawsuits that have been brought against the
U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  based  on  those  programs.  It  kind
of—it  highlights  the  fact  that  there  is  a  liability  issue  or  risk  that
comes  along  with  monitoring  or  administering  one  of  these  pro-
grams, and I don’t have the details of that but I would suggest that
there is a lot more to be—to explore regarding what assumption of
liabilities there are in administering the program.

Mr. INGLIS. I have no further questions, Madam Chair.
Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Before  bringing  this  hearing  to  a  close,  I  just
want  to  thank  all  of  our  panelists  and  I  really  want  to  thank  you

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Herbert  T.  Hayden,  Solar  Technology  Coordinator,  Arizona  Public

Service Company, Phoenix, Arizona

As the Solar Technology Coordinator for APS, my field of activity has been on the
technological  assessment  and  advancement  of  solar  technologies.  I  am  pleased  to
offer my views on the technical topics such as thermal energy storage, solar integra-
tion  to  regional  transmission  grids,  and  reduction  of  water  consumption  as  these
issues  relate  to  larger  scale  solar  technologies  such  as  concentrated  solar  projects
(CSP).

However,  there  are  other  aspects  of  the  proposed  legislation  pertaining  to  work-
force training and the promotion of solar power anti certification, which are policies
more  directly  impacting  manufacturers  and  installers  of  photovoltaic  systems  (PV),
and  other  solar-related  equipment.  Those  questions  would  be  better  answered  by
those  individuals  who  are  more  familiar  with  the  public  policy  concerns  associated
with the development of the solar industries. My answers in those areas are limited
and  I  respectfully  defer  to  others  who  may  feel  qualified  to  address  those  issues.

Q1. Are  you  familiar  with  the  Institute  of  Sustainable  Power?  Do  you  feel  com-
fortable having them run a certification program? What type of a fee would you
envision  would  be  required  for  them  to  ‘‘certify’’  workforce  training  programs?

A1. I am not familiar with the Institute of Sustainable Power
Q2. Have  you  reviewed  the  legislation  being  proposed  here  today?  Do  you  think  it
makes  sense  to  create  two  additional  layers  of  bureaucracy  for  the  Secretary  of
Energy to promote solar power or do you feel it would be easier to just give DOE
a grant to promote solar power? Please explain.

A2. We  believe  the  objectives  of  the  legislation  regarding  thermal  storage  and  CSP
are appropriate and productive. I have not reviewed the referenced legislation in re-
gards  to  the  education  and  promotion  of  solar  power,  and  I  do  not  have  an  opinion
on those aspects.
Q3. Do  you  think  solar  power  needs  to  be  promoted  in  order  to  be  successful  as  an

energy resource?

A3. I  believe  that  solar  power  is  a  proven  energy  technology,  however  the  costs  of
solar  are  still  too  high  for  it  to  compete  as  an  energy  resource  of  substantial  scale.
Solar costs can be further reduced as the technology advances and matures, and in-
centives  for  the  use  of  solar  will  allow  that  to  happen  more  quickly.  Promotion  of
the benefits of solar power can also encourage the use of solar.
Q4. Do you support the language in the bill that requires private companies to open

their books and records to Members of the Board for inspection?

A4. I have no opinion on this question.
Q5. The  language  of  the  bill  provides  for  criminal  penalties  for  release  of  informa-
tion  obtained  under  the  authority  of  the  Act  to  ‘‘any  agency  or  officer  of  the
United  States  for  any  purpose  other  than  implementation  of  this  Act.’’  What  in-
formation do you believe this language is seeking to protect? Do you agree crimi-
nal penalties are necessary?

A5. I have no opinion on this question.
Q6. The language of section 9 requires the continuation of the solar promotion board
and  committee  should  be  contingent  upon  a  vote  by  the  manufacturers  and  im-
porters.  Would  you  support  a  referendum  prior  to  creation  of  the  Board  and
Committee? Why or why not?

A6. I have no opinion on this question.
Q7. What  enforcement  by  the  Secretary  of  Energy  do  you  envision  that  might  war-
rant  a  civil  penalty  for  noncompliance  under  section  10  of  this  bill?  Is  this  sec-
tion necessary?

A7. I have no opinion on this question.
Q8. What type of investigation do you believe it would be necessary for the Secretary

of Energy to conduct under Section 11 of this bill?

A8. I have no opinion on this question.
Q9. How will your organization benefit from this legislation?
A9. APS, as a public utility with a strong commitment to the development of renew-
able  energy  resources  would  derive  benefits  from  a  comprehensive  energy  bill  that
a) provided incentives for utility use of solar, such as the ITC, and b) aided in tech-
nical areas such as thermal energy storage, reduced water consumption, and the in-
tegration of CSP facilities with regional transmission grids.
Q10. What kind of yearly revenues does the solar industry have which could be used

in a promotion program as envisioned by the legislation?

A10. I do not have the knowledge of the facts pertaining to solar industry revenues.
Q11. Where  does  each  of  you  see  solar  power  as  a  part  of  the  Nation’s  energy  mix

by 2015 by percentage if this bill is enacted?

A11. Solar is the largest renewable energy resource in Arizona. If you add the possi-
bility  of  integrating  solar  energy  into  the  regional  transmission  grid  and  improving
its  availability  with  storage  or  other  methods,  the  contribution  of  solar  energy  in
sunny regions like the southwest could help states in the southwest and west reach
their  overall  renewable  energy  goals,  which  currently  range  from  10  percent  to  20
percent  or  more.  I  am  not  in  a  position  to  determine  how  this  would  translate  to
the  Nation’s  energy  mix  as  a  whole,  where  other  renewable  energy  resources  may
also  contribute  a  substantial  share  of  the  Nation’s  energy  mix.  However,  from  a
technical  perspective,  the  intermittent  nature  of  solar  energy  resources  requires
utilities  to  rely  heavily  upon  conventional  energy  resources  to  meet  customer  de-
mands and to protect infrastructure. If technology is developed to allow for solar en-
ergy storage or other means of making the output of a solar plant firm and reliable,
this would make solar energy more viable for a greater share of the Nation’s energy
mix.
Q12. What  is  your  view  of  cost  sharing  of  the  training  programs  between  the  states

and Federal Government?

A12. I have no opinion on this question.
Q13. Are the unions opposed to the training provisions in the bill?
A13. I have no information on this topic.
Q14. Is  the  Draft  discussion  draft  duplicative  of  any  current  programs?  If  so  which
ones?  What  are  the  metrics  that  will  evaluate  success  of  the  training  or  solar
programs?

A14. I have no information on this topic.
Q15. Recognizing  the  scarce  resources  of  the  Federal  Government,  would  you  rather

see tax dollars go to innovative technologies or advertising solar power?

A15. From  my  perspective  as  a  technologist,  federal  support  for  innovative  tech-
nologies is critical. However, the question about whether advertising is a more effec-
tive  way  to  use  tax  dollars  is  outside  of  the  purview  of  my  work  and  is  an  issue
better answered by others.
Q16. In your opinion why does the contribution of solar power remain relatively low?

Is it ultimately due to the cost?

A16. Cost is certainly a major reason the contribution of solar power in the overall
energy  mix  remains  low  today.  In  addition,  most  solar  technologies  generate  elec-
tricity  only  when  the  sun  is  shining  so  other  sources  of  electricity  are  necessary  to
provide  firm  electric  power  in  response  to  customer  demand.  For  those  solar  power
technologies  that  include  storage  capability,  cost  continues  to  be  a  factor  since  the
cost  of  storage  adds  to  the  overall  cost  of  the  infrastructure.  Both  issues  will  need
to  be  addressed  for  solar  to  become  a  larger  part  of  the  electric  energy  mix  for  any
electric power utility.
Q17. The  Thermal  Energy  Storage  Section  of  the  discussion  draft  is  quite  brief  and
your  testimony  seems  to  focus  on  the  need  for  a  great  deal  of  research  and  de-
velopment  into  the  area  of  thermal  energy  storage.  What  elements  do  you  feel
should be addressed in a thermal energy storage research and development pro-
gram?

A17. As to the elements that should be addressed in a thermal research and devel-
opment  program,  the  key  is  that  the  market  related  to  this  technology  responds  to
demonstrated  solutions.  Therefore,  even  existing  technology  concepts  could  be  more

rapidly  accepted  as  economically  feasible  if  there  was  a  commercial  demonstration,
and  one  that  exhibited  favorable  cost,  environmental  and  reliability  features.  Stud-
ies  and  lab  validations  are  an  essential  first  step.  However,  to  attract  the  kind  of
up-front  capital  needed  for  a  commercial  project,  a  significant  demonstration  with
an ongoing field operation may prove necessary to satisfy investors.
Q18. Are  you  supportive  of  a  check  off  program  for  solar  energy  as  included  in  the

discussion draft? Would ASP be a participant?

A18. My  understanding  is  the  term  ‘‘check-off  program’’  relates  to  a  program  for
solar  education  and  promotion  that  would  apply  to  manufacturers  and  importers  of
solar  products.  Whether  APS  would  be  a  subject  to  such  a  check-off  program  will
depend on a variety of factors, therefore we would seek clarification of how the pro-
gram could apply to a utility that could be working with solar products.
Q19. You mention the use of federal land for locating large scale CSP. What environ-
mental,  including  siting  concerns,  do  you  see  being  faced  by  such  a  project?
2,500 contiguous acres of land is how big of an area? Can you give me a frame
of reference?

A19. In regards to the reference to 2,500 acres of land, consider that a square mile
‘‘section’’ of land is 640 acres. The 2,500 acre suggestion would be about four square
miles, and could accommodate sufficient CSP facilities for the generation of approxi-
mately  500  MW  of  power.  The  factors  that  would  have  to  be  considered  as  part  of
a  site  selection  would  be  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  consideration  of  im-
pacts  on  adjoining  property  uses,  the  available  natural  resources,  zoning  restric-
tions, taxes, etc.
Q20. You’ve  testified  that  CSP  is  ‘‘the  most  cost  effective  solar  technology’’  and  the
one that has the ‘‘greatest potential to compete economically’’ with conventional
generation.  What  are  the  relative  costs  between  CSP  and  conventional  genera-
tion?  Could  you  elaborate  on  the  figures  you  are  using?  Follow  up—You  have
testified in favor of a long-term extension of the 30 percent Investment tax cred-
it  (ITC).  How  long  is  ‘‘long-term’’  in  your  mind?  And  as  you’ve  said  the  poten-
tial  for  CSP  to  be  competitive  is  so  great,  would  it  be  so  without  the  ITC  in
place.

A20. Projects  with  commercially  demonstrated  CSP  technologies  are  being  offered
at  less  than  twice  the  cost  of  conventional  generation,  sometimes  significantly  less,
but  not  quite  competitive  with  conventional  generation.  These  current  project  costs
are dependent on the 30 percent ITC, currently available to third-party owners. The
ITC  reduces  the  cost  sufficiently  to  make  large  scale  CSP  attractive  to  many  utili-
ties.  If  the  ITC  is  not  extended,  we  believe  large  scale  CSP  plants  will  be  simply
too expensive and will not be constructed in the foreseeable future. Large scale CSP
plants  take  a  minimum  of  three  to  five  years  to  site,  permit  and  construct.  Con-
sequently,  the  ITC  should  be  extended  for  a  minimum  of  five  years,  but  ten  years
would  be  preferable.  We  believe  that  ten  years  would  be  sufficient  to  generate  nu-
merous projects resulting in greatly reduced costs and a sustainable industry, inde-
pendent of tax credits.
Q21. Would  you  favor  extending  the  30  percent  ITC  to  public  utilities?  If  it  were  to
be  extended  to  these  entities,  would  it  make  sense  to  place  greater  costs  for  re-
search,  training,  land  use  and  environmental  concerns  and  the  overall  pro-
motion of solar power on these public utilities?

A21. Generally,  we  favor  the  use  of  a  meaningful  ITC  program  as  an  incentive  to
public utilities for the investment in renewable energy facilities such as CSP. How-
ever,  an  ITC  has  to  be  carefully  weighed  by  an  organization  contemplating  using
the  ITC  to  see  if  its  operations  qualify,  and  whether  the  conditions  on  the  ITC  can
be met.
Q22. Mr.  Hayden,  you  mention  in  your  testimony  that  one  of  the  main  issues  with
solar  and  wind  energy  is  their  intermittency.  You  suggest  that  we  need  more
R&D into the area of storage. Are the storage issues different between wind and
solar  energy?  Should  we  focus  our  energies  on  storage  for  stationary  applica-
tions generally so that we could use the research for more than just solar tech-
nologies?  Without  adequate  storage  technology,  how  much  growth  can  reason-
ably be expected in the solar energy market?

A22. Wind  and  solar  energy  definitely  have  different  storage  issues  in  terms  of
availability  and  compatibility  with  current  technologies.  Wind  energy  technologies
and  the  various  kinds  of  solar  energy  technologies  would  integrate  differently  with
the known available storage technologies, such as thermal, compressed air, pumped

hydro,  and  batteries.  For  example,  any  source  of  electric  energy  could  be  used  to
drive  the  compressor  of  a  compressed  air  storage  system,  or  to  pump  water  for  a
hydro-storage system, which stores the energy for later use. However, since the CSP
systems use thermal processes, they have a unique opportunity to use thermal stor-
age more directly by storing solar heat before it is used to make electricity.

In  summary,  a  broad  support  of  stationary  storage  solutions  in  conjunction  with
the  development  of  CSP  resources  is  a  good  idea,  and  thermal  storage  technology
is  particularly  well  associated  with  current  CSP  plans.  Without  some  means  of  ad-
dressing the availability of intermittent renewable energy sources, and providing in-
centives such as ITC and rate recovery, public utilities like APS will continue to find
it difficult to expand solar energy in its energy mix. APS regards all of these issues
as important to the further development of renewable energy resources and without
some  changes  in  these  areas,  electric  utilities  will  continue  to  primarily  rely  upon
traditional energy resources to meet their customer needs and protect existing infra-
structure.

Responses by Rhone Resch, President, Solar Energy Industries Association

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

The  Solar  Energy  Industries  Association  thanks  the  Subcommittee  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  and  to  provide  written  responses  to  questions  asked  by  the  Com-
mittee  Ranking  Member.  On  the  questions  pertaining  to  workforce  training,  we
would defer to those expert witnesses who appeared before the Subcommittee to tes-
tify specifically on the workforce provisions in the discussion draft. Should you have
additional questions either relating to or independent of the responses below, please
do not hesitate to contact our offices at your convenience.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Have  you  reviewed  the  legislation  being  proposed  here  today?  Do  you  think  it
makes  sense  to  create  two  additional  layers  of  bureaucracy  for  the  Secretary  of
Energy to promote solar power or do you feel it would be easier to just give DOE
a grant to promote solar power? Please explain.

A1. SEIA  reviewed  the  discussion  draft  prior  to  the  hearing  and  has  since  had  the
opportunity  to  review  the  provisions  that  were  passed  out  of  the  Committee.  Based
on our reading of the draft, the primary composition of the Board, and the direction
it  is  to  provide,  will  come  from  industry.  The  participation  of  the  Secretary  of  En-
ergy on the Board seems appropriate, given the large role the DOE plays in the de-
velopment  of  solar  technologies,  but  it  seems  clear  that  the  solar  industry  will  (ap-
propriately)  remain  the  lead  agent  in  disseminating  information  about  solar  prod-
ucts.
Q2. Do  you  think  solar  power  needs  to  be  promoted  in  order  to  be  successful  as  an

energy resource?

A2. Solar  power,  particularly  in  the  distribution  generation  model,  requires  in-
creased  consumer  awareness  in  order  to  achieve  greater  deployment.  As  we  have
stated in written testimony to the Committee,

Though  growing  exponentially  and  constantly  innovating,  the  U.S.  solar  indus-
try is still in a nascent period. . .solar [photovoltaics] provides less than 1/30th
of  one  percent  of  the  current  U.S.  electricity  supply.  Furthermore,  PV  is  pri-
marily  a  distributed  generation  technology  that  is  installed  on  the  rooftops  of
homes  and  businesses  throughout  the  U.S.—a  paradigm  shift  from  the  tradi-
tional model of centralized electricity generation. Most solar installation compa-
nies are small businesses, typically employing no more than a few dozen people,
and lacking the budget to reach a broad swath of consumers.
Thus, even as consumers embrace the idea of solar power, they are usually not
fully  aware  of  its  capabilities  and  they  have  misconceptions  about  how  a  solar
energy system works in a home. Market reports demonstrate a lack of consumer
understanding  that  solar  electricity  operates  just  like  regular  electricity  and  is
the same kind of electricity that a local utility company provides. 29 percent of
respondents  to  the  May  2007  Roper  survey  were  not  aware  that  solar  energy
can  power  common  electric  devices  like  computers  or  appliances.  A  number  of
common  myths  persist  about  modern  solar  technology,  such  as  the  belief  that
solar will not work in places outside of the Sunbelt or that solar devices require
more  energy  to  manufacture  than  they  produce  in  their  lifetime,  and  these
myths  often  inhibit  consumer  consideration  of  solar  as  a  viable  energy  source.
Furthermore,  consumers  lack  information  on  how  to  find  solar  companies  or
what  solar  products  might  be  available.  On  a  daily  basis,  the  most  common
phone calls to SEIA come from consumers who ask, ‘‘Where can I find solar for
my  home?’’  The  industry  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  centralize  this  type
of information, including the development of a national solar installer directory,
Findsolar.com.  Individually,  several  companies  have  undertaken  consumer
awareness campaigns that focus on basic technology education. Yet these efforts
clearly  do  not  equate  to  the  potential  reach  of  a  national  consumer  awareness
campaign.

Therefore, we believe that a national campaign promoting solar energy would sig-

nificantly increase solar’s market growth.
Q3. Do you support the language in the bill that requires private companies to open
their  books  and  records  to  Members  of  the  Board  for  inspection?  The  language
of  the  bill  provides  for  criminal  penalties  for  release  of  information  obtained

81

under  the  authority  of  the  Act  to  ‘‘any  agency  or  officer  of  the  United  States  for
any  purpose  other  than  implementation  of  this  Act.’’  What  information  do  you
believe  this  language  is  seeking  to  protect?  Do  you  agree  criminal  penalties  are
necessary?

A3. All  corporations  have  confidential  business  information  that  must  be  safe-
guarded  in  order  to  encourage  companies  to  do  business  in  the  U.S.  The  relevant
provisions of this discussion draft are designed to facilitate the collection of market
data  for  purposes  of  levying  assessments  on  producers,  while  safeguarding  data
from dilatory or improper use. We perceive that this approach borrows largely from
the legislation used to create other industry check-off programs and would welcome
a continuing dialogue on how best to achieve effective reporting and compliance.
Q4. The language of section 9 requires the continuation of the solar promotion board
and  committee  should  be  contingent  upon  a  vote  by  the  manufacturers  and  im-
porters.  Would  you  support  a  referendum  prior  to  creation  of  the  Board  and
Committee? Why or why not?

A4. SETA  would  be  open  to  a  referendum  prior  to  the  creation  of  the  Board  and
Committee.  Furthermore,  it  is  our  understanding  that  the  industry  would  have  the
power  to  periodically  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  program,  with  a  focus  on  its
economic  benefits  to  industry  members.  This  is  appropriate  given  that  then  solar
check-off  program  is  funded  by  a  tax  that  is  established  by  the  industry,  with  the
blessing  of  members  of  the  industry,  and  for  the  benefit  of  the  industry  as  well  as
the general public.
Q5. What  enforcement  by  the  Secretary  of  Energy  do  you  envision  that  might  war-
rant  a  civil  penalty  for  noncompliance  under  section  10  of  this  bill?  Is  this  sec-
tion necessary?

A5. In  studying  existing  check-off  programs,  it  appears  common  that  enforcement
powers  are  granted  to  eliminate  the  problem  of  ‘‘free  riders,’’  or  nonpaying  compa-
nies  that  might  otherwise  benefit  economically  from  programs  that  others  have
funded.  Without  enforcement  provisions,  programs  would  be  less  likely  to  ensure
that all companies participate.
Q6. What type of investigation do you believe it would be necessary for the Secretary

of Energy to conduct under Section 11 of this bill?

A6. Most  likely,  any  such  investigations  would  be  pursuant  to  issues  of  compliance
with the assessment process.
Q7. How will your organization benefit from this legislation?
A7. SETA  is  a  501(c)(6)  non-profit  association  that  works  to  make  solar  power  a
mainstream and significant component of the U.S. energy supply. As the discussion
draft  currently  provides,  SETA  would  be  able  to  serve  on  the  promotion  board  and
play  a  role  in  designing  and  implementing  a  national  consumer  awareness  cam-
paign.  In  doing  so,  SEIA  would  address  one  of  its  core  functions:  to  educate  con-
sumers on the benefits of solar technologies.
Q8. What  kind  of  yearly  revenues  does  the  solar  industry  have  which  could  be  used

in a promotion program as envisioned by the legislation?

A8. Globally, the solar photovoltaic industry manufactured 2.2 Gigawatts of product
in  2006.  The  U.S.,  with  seven  percent  market  share,  manufactured  PV  products
worth slightly more than $1 billion, with a net export of 10 percent of product.
Q9. Where  does  each  of  you  see  solar  power  as  a  part  of  the  Nation’s  energy  mix  by

2015 by percentage if this bill is enacted?

A9. As  stated  in  SEIA’s  testimony,  a  check-off  program  will  only  succeed  if  appro-
priate  incentives  are  in  place,  including  an  eight-year  extension  of  the  federal  in-
vestment  tax  credits  (ITC).  Over  the  past  decade,  due  to  a  lack  of  progressive  na-
tional  policy,  the  U.S.  has  lost  global  leadership  in  the  race  to  attract  solar  energy
manufacturing,  installation,  and  jobs.  Long-term  demand-side  incentive  policies  in
Japan  and  Europe  have  spurred  the  formation  of  hundreds  of  new  companies  and
tens  of  thousands  of  new  solar  industry  jobs  in  those  countries;  Germany,  with  the
solar  resources  of  Anchorage,  AK,  installs  eight  times  more  PV  each  year  than  the
entire  U.S.  With  appropriately  designed  incentive  policies  and  increased  consumer
awareness, we anticipate that solar power could provide 10–15 percent of new incre-
mental generating capacity annually in the U.S. by 2015.
Q10. I  note  that,  as  indicated  in  Section  2(7),  the  program  is  generally  intended  to
improve  the  ‘‘competitive  position. . .of  solar  energy  products  in  the  market-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:06 Dec 20, 2007 Jkt 036001 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061907\36001 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

82

place.’’  Because  the  program  includes  importers,  apparently  this  means  pro-
moting  all  solar  products  (including  German)  against  other  technologies.  Does
this matter to American producers?

A10. We  anticipate  that  U.S.  companies  would,  by  far  and  away,  benefit  the  most
from  a  strong  demand  signal  in  the  U.S.  market.  One  of  the  realities  of  solar  com-
merce  is  that  companies  generally  prefer  to  manufacture  high-tech  products  close
to where the markets are, rather than ship them overseas and go through an exten-
sive distribution system. In Germany, a national feed-in tariff incentive program for
solar  PV  has  helped  to  industrialize  some  of  that  country’s  most  economically  de-
pressed regions. In the U.S., the states with the best-designed and long-term incen-
tive  programs  have  attracted  the  most  development.  Thus,  in  the  current  race  for
global  solar  energy  leadership,  increasing  consumers’  awareness  and  demand  for
solar is one of the optimal methods for growing the U.S. industry.
Q11. Has the SEIA tried to do a voluntary check-off program?
A11. SEIA  has  not  tried  to  implement  a  voluntary  check-off  program.  In  formu-
lating our testimony on the discussion draft, we looked at other industries that had
implemented check-off programs. Historical examination shows that industries have
indeed organized voluntary check-offs, but they account for only a small share of all
funding  for  generic  efforts.  It  seems  likely  that  the  establishment  of  legislative  au-
thority helps ensure the efficacy of check-off programs. This authority facilitates the
practicalities  of  dealing  in  interstate  commerce  and,  as  mentioned  above,  helps  to
eliminate the problem of ‘‘free riders,’’ or nonpaying companies that might otherwise
benefit economically from programs that others have funded.
Q12. In your testimony, you talk mostly about distributed generation technologies of
solar  energy.  Do  you  see  more  of  a  potential  for  solar  energy  on  this  smaller
scale or as a large solar power plant?

A12. We  believe  that  there  is  a  vital  role  both  for  distributed  solar  generation  and
for  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP)  in  the  U.S.  energy  portfolio.  Both  PV  and  CSP
provide  high-value  electricity  during  peak  demand  hours,  from  10  A.M.  to  5  P.M.
on  hot,  sunny  days,  thus  helping  to  conserve  the  use  of  valuable  natural  gas.  The
Western  Governors’  Association  Solar  Task  Force  recently  identified  200  GW  of
prime  potential  sites  for  CSP  in  the  Southwest,  including  several  sites  in  Texas.
Furthermore,  a  study  by  Navigant  Consulting  found  that  eligible  rooftop  space  in
the  U.S.  could  provide  700  GW  of  PV.  We  encourage  the  greater  use  of  CSP  and
PV alike.
Q13. How  many  members  does  the  SEIA  have?  How  many  member  organizations  I
companies  would  benefit  from  additional  funding  for  research?  How  many
member organizations/companies would not?

A13. SEIA  represents  over  550  companies  involved  in  the  U.S.  solar  energy  indus-
try. Through our weekly newsletters and alerts, we actively encourage our members
to participate in collaborative R&D efforts with the Department of Energy under the
President’s  Solar  America  Initiative,  announced  by  the  White  House  in  the  2006
State  of  the  Union  and  first  funded  in  FY  2007.  The  DOE  Solar  Energy  Tech-
nologies Program has, at the time of this writing, announced two rounds of funding
awards.  The  recipients  are  consortia  of  industry  (usually  several  companies  per
award), national laboratories, universities, and non-profits. While it would be impre-
cise  to  guess  how  many  companies  would  benefit  from  future  research  funding,  we
anticipate that such funding would continue to be directed towards collaborative re-
search teams incorporating companies from throughout the solar value chain.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jane  M.  Weissman,  Executive  Director,  Interstate  Renewable  Energy

Council; Vice Chair, North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1a. Are you familiar with the Institute for Sustainable Power?
A1a. Yes.

The  Institute  for  Sustainable  Power’s  (ISP)  accreditation  and  certification  pro-
grams began 1996. International renewable energy, education, training, and accredi-
tation  experts  worked  to  create  ISPQ  Standard  #01021,  which  provides  the  guide-
lines and sets the bar for the accreditation of training programs and the certification
of trainers in the renewable energy field. The objectives of the Standard are:

• to  provide  training  programs  worldwide  with  a  harmonized  training  content-
and  delivery-guide  for  the  knowledge  and  skills  competencies  for  renewable
energy workforces;

• to  increase  the  confidence  level  that  industry,  employers,  consumers,  fin-
anciers,  and  governments  can  have  in  the  participating  training  programs
and  trainers  by  providing  a  globally  accepted  process  of  evaluation  and  sur-
veillance (audit and periodic re-evaluation) of training programs and trainers,
and periodic re-evaluation of the standards; and

• to encourage safety and the training of safe practices within the industry.

In  2005,  ISP  decentralized  operations  and  created  licensees  for  operations  in  the

United States, the UK and the Asia-Pacific area.

As  of  July  2005,  the  Interstate  Renewable  Energy  Council  (IREC)  is  the  North
American  Licensee  for  the  Institute  for  Sustainable  Power’s  Quality  (ISPQ)  Inter-
national  Standard  #01021  for  Renewable  Energy  Training  Accreditation  and  In-
structor  Certification  programs.  IREC  is  responsible  for  the  full  accreditation  and
certification  cycle  including  processing  applications,  assigning  registered  auditors,
awarding  the  credential,  and  maintaining  all  records  of  applicants,  candidates  and
certificants.

IREC awards formal recognition for five (5) ISPQ designations:

1. Accreditation for Training Programs
2. Accreditation for Continuing Education Providers
3. Certification for Independent Master Trainers
4. Certification for Affiliated Master Trainers
5. Certification for Instructors

Using the ISPQ International Standard #01021 as a guide, with an approved Task
Analysis  as  the  content  standard,  IREC’s  ISPQ-Registered  Auditors  evaluate  can-
didates  for  accreditation  and  certification  through  a  desk  and/or  on-site  audit.  The
Auditors prepare the results of their evaluation and report to the IREC ISPQ Award
Committee  which  is  responsible  for  the  final  decision  on  training  accreditation  and
trainer certification.

Two  attached  documents  demonstrate  the  rigor  and  depth  of  the  ISPQ  process:
Standard #01021 and the Candidate Handbook. For further information, please visit
www.isaausa org.
Q1b. Do you feel comfortable having them run a certification program?
A1b. Yes. The Interstate Renewable Energy Council has been working for over two
decades  as  a  non-profit  organization  committed  to  moving  renewable  energy  re-
sources into the marketplace. IREC emphasizes education and outreach, stakeholder
coordination,  technical  assistance,  workforce  development,  the  adoption  and  imple-
mentation  of  uniform  guidelines  and  standards,  and  consumer  protection.  IREC  is
known for its ability to identify critical issues, build networks, and develop and dis-
seminate  information  tools  that  make  the  work  of  solar  energy  stakeholders  more
effective. The Council has a proven track record for producing material and products
with  the  highest  professional  standards,  meeting  deadlines  and  managing  its  oper-
ations efficiently and effectively. (www.irecusa.org)

IREC’s  Accreditation  and  Certification  Programs  receive  counsel  and  oversight
from  a  national,  10-person  advisory  board  which  includes  trainers,  industry,  and
credentialing and education experts.

Q1c. What  type  of  fee  would  you  envision  would  be  required  for  them  to  ‘‘certify’’

workforce training programs?

A1c. To  date,  below  is  the  current  fee  application  and  maintenance  fee  structure.
The  fees  are  purposely  kept  low.  In  this  early  stage  of  operation,  the  fee  structure
does not support the full management and administration of the ISPQ process.

Q2. How will your organization benefit from this legislation?
A2. IREC’s goal is a simple one—to guarantee quality training for the solar energy
practitioner.  The  ISPQ  process  is  a  rigorous  one  and  there  has  been  considerable
resources spent to make this credentialing process fair, based on industry-developed
standards,  and  provide  non  bias,  third-party  assessment  of  training  programs.  All
documents and procedures have received subject-matter expert and legal review. We
would  like  to  see  this  legislation  encourage  the  ISPQ  assessment  process  but  our
goal is to make sure that there is assessable, quality training available for solar en-
ergy installers.
Q3. What  is  your  view  of  cost  sharing  of  the  training  programs  between  the  states

and Federal Government?

A3. When possible, IREC encourages cost sharing especially for states with System
Benefit  Funds.  However,  we  do  not  think  that  states  without  these  funding  re-
sources should be penalized. We recommend that cost sharing is encouraged but not
required.
Q4. Are the unions opposed to the training provisions in the bill?
A4. We have not had any direct conversations with the unions in regard to this bill.
However, the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (NJATC) sup-
ports  ISPQ  goals  and  its  mission,  and  intends  to  facilitate  voluntary  JATC  partici-
pation  in  the  ISPQ  framework.  NJATC  is  presently  seeking  Accredited  Training
Program  status  under  ISPQ  for  Solar  Photovoltaic  (PV)  Systems.  The  scope  of  this
accreditation will cover the new NJATC Solar PV System curriculum, its ITC facili-
ties  in  Alcoa,  TN,  NJATC  instructors,  its  program  administrative  policies  and
courses offered by NJATC. We would be happy to provide contact information to the
NJATC.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Joseph  T.  Sarubbi,  Professor/Department  Chair,  Building  Systems

Technology Department, Hudson Valley Community College

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1a. Are You familiar with the Institute for Sustainable Power?
A1a. Yes.
Q1b. Do you feel comfortable having them run a certification program?
A1b. Yes. The Institute for Sustainable Power has worked hard to ensure that com-
panies, installers, and training institutions meet rigorous standards that will make
certain the type of reliability needed for positive industry growth and consumer con-
fidence.  I  have  intimate  knowledge  of  ISP’s  standards  and  believe  they  do  well  to
manage quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC).
Q1c. What  type  of  fee  would  you  envision  would  be  required  for  them  to  ‘‘certify’’

workforce training programs?

A1c. An  exact  figure  is  difficult  for  me  to  ascertain.  To  ensure  that  all  institutions
applying for accreditation meet ISP standards a site visit to the institution seeking
accreditation by the ISP evaluation team is essential. In Hudson Valley Community
College’s situation, the New York State Energy Research and Development Author-
ity  provided  the  resources  to  allow  the  College  to  position  itself  for  Accreditation.
National  sponsorship  of  ISP  could  reduce  the  costs  associated  with  institutional  ac-
creditation and help these institutions move swiftly, yet responsibly, towards accred-
itation.  The  Interstate  Renewable  Energy  Council  (IREC)  developed  a  fee  structure
for evaluation of solar programs and institutions seeking accreditation, and Hudson
Valley  Community  College  is  working  within  these  fee  guidelines.  I  am  confident
in IREC’s ability to manage the costs associated with accreditation and certification.
Q2a. Have you reviewed the legislation proposed here today?
A2a. Yes.
Q2b. Do  you  think  it  makes  sense  to  create  two  additional  layers  of  bureaucracy  for
the Secretary of Energy to promote solar power or do you feel it would be easier
to just give DOE a grant to promote solar power? Please explain.

A2b. The  Solar  Energy  Industries  Research  and  Promotion  Board,  as  well  as  the
Solar Energy Industries Research and Promotion Operating Committee make sense
in that they will be strong advocates for the advancement of the solar industry. The
members  of  the  Board,  as  well  as  the  Committee,  will  be  stakeholders  in  the  solar
industry and will provide a platform for sound solar energy initiatives. While an ar-
gument  could  certainly  be  made  that  we  are  creating  more  levels  of  bureaucracy,
in this case, I believe the layers are valid; especially knowing that (1) no Board and
Committee members will receive compensation for their service, and (2) most, if not
all, Board and/or Committee members will be utilizing the resources, staffs, and fa-
cilities of existing organizations.
Q3. Do you believe solar power needs to be promoted in order to be successful as an

energy resource?

A3. Yes.  There  is  a  certain  level  of  complacency  that  exists  in  our  society  and  I’ve
learned  throughout  the  years  that  an  effectively  promoted  initiative  has  positive
outcomes. There are many examples to point to, some of which were identified dur-
ing  the  hearing.  I  truly  believe  that  an  educated  public  is  our  strongest  asset  and
right  now  I  don’t  believe  that  the  Nation  yet  fully  understands  the  value  of  invest-
ing  in  solar  power,  especially  the  younger  generation.  The  same  could  be  said  for
other renewable energy resources.
Q4. Do you support the language in the bill that requires private companies to open

their books and records to Members of the Board for inspection?

A4. I don’t have the expertise to adequately answer this question.
Q5. The  language  of  this  bill  provides  for  criminal  penalties  for  release  of  informa-
tion  obtained  under  the  authority  of  the  Act  to  ‘‘any  agency  or  officer  of  the
United  States  for  any  purpose  other  than  the  implementation  of  this  act.’’  What
information  do  you  believe  this  language  is  seeking  to  protect?  Do  you  agree
criminal penalties are necessary?

A5. Again,  I  believe  I  don’t  have  the  expertise  to  adequately  answer  this  question.
Q6. The language of section 9 requires the continuation of the solar promotion board
and  committee  should  be  contingent  upon  a  vote  by  the  manufacturers  and  im-
porters.  Would  you  support  a  referendum  prior  to  creation  of  the  Board  and
Committee? Why or why not?

A6. Again,  I  believe  I  don’t  have  the  expertise  to  adequately  answer  this  question.
Q7. What  enforcement  by  the  Secretary  of  Energy  do  you  envision  that  might  war-
rant civil penalty for noncompliance under section 10 of this bill? Is this section
necessary?

A7. Again,  I  believe  I  don’t  have  the  expertise  to  adequately  answer  this  question.
Q8. What  type  of  investigation  do  you  believe  it  would  necessary  for  the  Secretary

of Energy to conduct under section 11 of this bill?

A8. Again,  I  believe  I  don’t  have  the  expertise  to  adequately  answer  this  question.
Q9. How will your organization benefit from this bill?
A9. Hudson  Valley  Community  College  received  a  grant  from  the  New  York  State
Energy  Research  and  Development  Authority  to  establish  our  solar  program.  As  a
leader in solar training Hudson Valley Community College will be able to seek addi-
tional  resources  to  develop  new  solar  training  programs  that  are  responsive  to  the
industry,  as  well  as  expand  our  existing  program  offerings.  As  the  solar  industry
grows,  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  would  seek  additional  funding  for  solar
programmatic  initiatives  which  include  resources  for  additional  faculty,  curriculum
development, and enhanced training facilities to react to industry trends.
Q10. What kind of yearly revenues does the solar industry have which could be used

in a promotion program as envisioned by the legislation?

A10. Again, I believe I don’t have the expertise to adequately answer this question.
Q11. Where  does  each  of  you  see  solar  power  as  a  part  of  the  Nation’s  energy  mix

by 2015 by percentage if this bill is enacted?

A11. This bill will go a long way towards making the United States a national play-
er in the solar power generation industry, and inform the world that we are serious
about renewable energy.
Q12. What is your view on cost sharing of the training programs between the states

and Federal Government?

A12. Again, I believe I don’t have the expertise to adequately answer this question.
Q13. Are the unions opposed to this training bill?
A13. Quite  the  contrary.  The  International  Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers,  for
example,  is  very  invested  in  training  their  journeyman  in  solar  installation  tech-
nology.  They  see  economic  growth  and  job  creation  with  this  bill.  One  only  has  to
look at New York City’s ‘‘Million solar roofs’’ initiative to see the impact on job cre-
ation as a valid example.
Q14. Is  the  draft  discussion  draft  duplicative  of  any  current  programs?  If  so  which
ones?  What  are  the  metrics  that  will  evaluate  success  of  the  training  or  solar
programs?

A14. A handful of states, such as California, New Jersey, and New York, have solar
training  initiatives  that  have  proven  track  records,  but  the  United  States  needs  a
national  program  to  ensure  the  type  of  growth  that  it  aspires  to  reach  by  2015.  A
national  program  will  ensure  other  states  will  have  the  opportunity  to  enhance  job
creation in the solar industry.
Q15. Mr.  Sarubbi,  you  have  demonstrated  that  the  photovoltaic  program  at  your
community  college  is  in  high  demand  and  has  been  able  to  seek  out  several
business  partners.  Does  the  Federal  Government  need  to  be  involved  to  ‘‘spur’’
further collaborations?

A15. Absolutely!  Our  success  was  driven  by  a  collaborative  effort  between  a  State
government  agency,  as  well  as  national  organizations  such  as  IREC,  with  the  re-
sources and guidelines to establish an effective solar training program, and an edu-
cational institution with the vision to see the value of this training. The government
resources  gave  the  college  the  confidence  to  move  forward,  which  made  attracting
support  from  local  solar  companies  viable.  Our  growth  is  still  contingent  on  pro-
curing  resources  that  would  allow  the  College  to  expand  its  offerings  and  further

develop  partnerships.  It’s  all  about  confidence.  Having  the  DOE  as  a  sponsor  of
solar training programs will spur confidence and ensure industry growth.
Q16. As your program has grown, have you had to advertise your services?
A16. Interestingly,  the  College  has  gained  significantly  in  ‘‘free’’  advertisement  as
news agencies continue to report on the success of our solar training programs, fur-
ther  spurring  interest  in  the  community.  The  ‘‘press’’  has  helped  us  ‘‘get  the  word
out’’  and  the  College  has  been  the  beneficiary  of  this  exposure.  The  College  also
maintains  a  website  link  dedicated  to  solar  training  which  continues  to  garner  at-
tention from those seeking information about gaining solar training.
Q17. What we’ve heard today from a number of experts that explain that solar tech-
nologies  are  rapidly  changing  and  evolving.  Do  you  offer  a  continuing  edu-
cation program to meet these changing demands?

A17. Absolutely!  Hudson  Valley  Community  College  has  a  Workforce  Development
Institute  that  seeks  to  continuously  provide  training  to  meet  the  needs  of  industry
and solar training is no different. For example, as state and local building and elec-
trical  codes  change  to  adapt  to  the  changing  solar  technology,  the  College  provides
workshops for code inspectors to keep them abreast of these latest technological ad-
vances.  The  College  is  currently  developing  ‘‘advanced’’  solar  training  courses  that
will  be  offered  through  Workforce  Development  to  keep  Certified  Installers  ‘‘fluid.’’
Q18. Has the Department of Energy assisted you in anyway? If so, how?
A18. At  this  stage  I  am  not  aware  of  any  direct  assistance  from  the  Department
of Energy.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Daniel  E.  Arvizu,  Director,  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,

U.S. Department of Energy

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. Are  you  familiar  with  the  Institute  of  Sustainable  Power?  Do  you  feel  com-
fortable having them run a certification program? What type of a fee would you
envision  would  be  required  for  them  to  ‘‘certify’’  workforce  training  programs?
A1. I am familiar with the Institute for Sustainable Power which coordinates, devel-
ops,  and  maintains  international  standards  for  the  evaluation  and  qualification  of
renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency  and  distributed  generation  training  providers.
ISP has a solid reputation for the quality of the work it does. I am not in a position
to comment on an appropriate fee for certifying workforce training programs.

I  would  suggest,  however,  that  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  Solar  Program
be consulted on options for improving training and certification of solar energy pro-
fessionals.  As  part  of  its  Solar  America  Initiative,  the  DOE  has  created  a  program
to improve and expand solar installer training in cooperation with the North Amer-
ican  Board  of  Certified  Energy  Practitioners  (NABCEP).  The  DOE’s  efforts  in  this
area may be of interest to the Committee.
Q2. Have  you  reviewed  the  legislation  being  proposed  here  today?  Do  you  think  it
makes  sense  to  create  two  additional  layers  of  bureaucracy  for  the  Secretary  of
Energy to promote solar power or do you feel it would be easier to just give DOE

A2. I will defer to DOE on this question.
Q3. Do  you  think  solar  power  needs  to  be  promoted  in  order  to  be  successful  as  an

energy resource?

A3. As Americans begin to enjoy more options as to where they get their power and
fuel,  I  believe  they  need  clear,  credible  and  consistent  information  about  all  energy
sources to help them make informed decisions about which options to choose.
Q4. Do you support the language in the bill that requires private companies to open

their books and records to Members of the Board for inspection?

A4. I will defer to DOE on this question.
Q5. The  language  of  the  bill  provides  for  criminal  penalties  for  release  of  informa-
tion  obtained  under  the  authority  of  the  Act  to  ‘‘any  agency  or  officer  of  the

A11. This  bill  addresses,  and  in  some  cases  expands  on,  a  number  of  important
areas of solar energy research, development and demonstration currently sponsored
by the DOE. It identifies critical research on thermal storage for concentrating solar
power  technologies  that  will  make  those  technologies  significantly  more  valuable  to
utilities  interested  in  integrating  them  within  their  system.  It  also  calls  for  con-
tinuing  studies  of  that  integration  with  a  particular  focus  on  water  issues  critical
items for successful market penetration of CSP.

I  would  suggest  that  the  DOE  be  consulted  regarding  the  additional  demonstra-
tion  programs  the  bill  mandates  for  daylighting,  solar  air  conditioning,  and
photovoltaics. The DOE is currently expanding its efforts on demonstration and de-
ployment of distributed solar and building efficiency technologies, and I believe that
commercialization of these technologies will occur most rapidly if it is pursued with-
in the context of the broader requirements and opportunities in the buildings sector.
Together, these various efforts will reinforce the DOE programs to move solar en-
ergy  into  position  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  the  U.S.  energy  picture  by
2015. The amount of solar power in our future energy mix will depend on a number
of  factors,  but  supporting  legislation  can  help  accelerate  the  amount  we  have  in
2015.
Q12. What  is  your  view  of  cost  sharing  of  the  training  programs  between  the  states

and Federal Government?

A12. I will defer to DOE on this question.
Q13. Are the unions opposed to the training provisions in the bill?
A13. NREL is not qualified to answer this question.
Q14. Is  the  Draft  discussion  draft  duplicative  of  any  current  programs?  If  so  which
ones?  What  are  the  metrics  that  will  evaluate  success  of  the  training  or  solar
programs?

A14. I  will  defer  to  DOE  on  the  first  part  of  the  question  dealing  with  duplication
of  current  programs.  As  to  metrics  for  evaluating  the  success  of  training  and  other
solar programs, the major metric for the Solar Program is the levelized cost of elec-
tricity. The attached slide presents the goal of the solar program to have competitive
prices of electricity in the three market sectors (residential, commercial, and utility)
by  2015.  A  secondary  goal  is  to  have  about  4  gigawatts  of  installed  solar  power  by
2015.
Q15. In  your  testimony  you  state  that  the  ‘‘Solar  Energy  Program  goal  is  to  reduce
the  cost  of  solar  photovoltaic  technologies  so  that  they  become  cost  competitive
with  other  sources  of  electricity  in  all  major  U.S.  markets  by  2015.’’  Are  you
on track to reach this goal? What major hurdles would prevent you from doing
so?

A15. The  current  DOE  Solar  Program  in  photovoltaics  is  designed  to  make  solar
electricity cost competitive in the three major markets—residential, commercial, and
utility—by  2015  through  the  President’s  Solar  American  Initiative.  This  initiative
builds  on  the  experience  with  bringing  down  the  costs  of  solar  electricity  from  suc-
cessful  programs  in  Japan  and  Europe.  The  program  is  currently  on  track  to  meet
these  2015  targets  for  the  U.S.  consumer.  Technology  investments  and  consistent
policies  are  both  important,  but  to  ensure  success,  to  increase  the  technical  leader-
ship  of  the  U.S.  in  this  expanding  high-technology  business,  and  to  build  a  solid
technical workforce in the U.S. economy, the investment in R&D both in the short-
and long-term, must be strong, consistent and sustainable.
Q16. You  mention  that  CSP  power  plants  can  be  quickly  constructed.  How  quickly
and  how  much  do  they  cost  to  build?  Are  there  any  NIMBY  issues  involved
with their siting and construction?

A16. SolarGenix recently completed construction of a 64 MW plant near Las Vegas,
Nevada. Construction of the 64 MW plant took approximately one year to complete.
This matches previous experience in the late 80’slearly 90’s where nine CSP plants
were built in the Mojave Desert over a period of six years.

It  is  hard  to  predict  NIMBY  issues.  CSP  plants  tend  to  be  located  in  desert  re-
gions  not  ideal  for  residential  development.  However,  as  is  the  case  in  California,
concerns have risen over the development of CSP on sensitive habitats (e.g., Desert
Tortoise). As with other forms of conventional or renewable generation, construction

of  new  transmission  or  upgrades  of  existing  transmission  can  raise  regional  con-
cerns.
Q17. Are there any CSP plants with thermal storage in operation today? Are any hy-
brid  CSP/natural  gas  plants  in  operation?  If  not,  when  can  we  expect  to  see
them running?

A17. All of the existing nine parabolic trough plants operating in the Mojave Desert
are  hybridized  with  natural  gas,  therefore  supplying  100  percent  of  their  rated  ca-
pacity  during  peak  utility  periods.  Two  plants  under  construction  in  Spain  (antici-
pated  to  be  operational  in  2008  and  2009)  will  use  6–7  hours  of  two-tank  indirect
molten  salt  storage.  However  storage  costs  need  to  be  reduced  before  such  plants
would be considered economically competitive.
Q18. How  does  this  legislation  fit  within  the  Administration’s  energy  initiatives?  I
know  that  the  Administration  announced  $168  million  to  help  reduce  the  cost
of solar energy.

A18. I will defer to DOE on this question.
Q19. Has  the  Administration  done  a  cost  estimate  of  the  bill?  Page  20  calls  for  an

unlimited authorization. What is your estimate?

A19. I will defer to DOE on this question.
Q20. Solar power has had problems with environmental concerns with toxic like cad-
mium  used  in  some  photovoltaic  cells.  Does  CSP  use  cells  that  contain  these
kinds of materials that might cause environmental concerns? Are there any en-
vironmental concerns as to land use, etc.?

A20. Concentrating  Solar  Power  systems  use  thermal  energy  to  drive  an  energy
conversion device (steam/gas turbine or Stirling engine) rather than solar cells. Heat
transfer  fluids  used  by  some  systems  can  consist  of  synthetic  oils  or  molten  salts
can both be considered hazardous but have been widely used and permitted in com-
mercial  or  demonstration  plants  in  California.  Land  use  can  be  a  concern  where
plants  are  being  considered  near  sensitive  habitat  areas  (e.g.,  the  Desert  Tortoise
in  California’s  Mojave  Desert).  Parabolic  trough  and  power  tower  plants  require
water  for  cooling  (as  with  conventional  generation)  although  dry  cooling  designs
have been studied and are being considered for future plants.
