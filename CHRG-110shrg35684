THE  STATE  OF  THE  AIRLINE  INDUSTRY:  THE 
POTENTIAL  IMPACT  OF  AIRLINE  MERGERS 
AND  INDUSTRY  CONSOLIDATION 

WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY  24,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:15  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  If  I  may,  I  would  like  to  submit  my  statement 
on  the  airline  industry,  and  yield  the  chair  to  Senator  Rockefeller. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Over  the  past  5  years,  the  airline  industry  has  suffered  its  worst  financial  per-
formance in the history of commercial flight. Collectively, domestic air carriers have 
lost nearly $40 billion, but after intense restructuring among the major carriers, the 
industry may have turned a corner. Even conservative estimates suggest the airline 
industry  will  turn  a  profit  of  $4  billion  in  2007.  Despite  this  positive  outlook,  most 
industry  observers  warn  that  external  factors  or  other  negative  business  trends 
could dramatically impact any potential profits next year or beyond. 

In  this  climate,  US  Airways  has  proposed  a  merger  with  Delta  Air  Lines  that 
many believe would lead to rapid consolidation of the legacy air carriers serving the 
United  States.  Due  to  the  industry-wide  implications  of  the  proposed  consolidation, 
it  is  critical  that  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee  review  and  understand  the  po-
tential  effects  of  such  a  deal.  Aviation  is  vitally  important  to  our  Nation’s  system 
of  transportation  and  commerce.  We  must  be  quite  certain  that  the  likely  benefits 
of various merger proposals far outweigh any potential consequences. 

Financial  analysts  generally  agree  that  consolidation  will  be  good  for  the  airline 
industry  because  it  will  quickly  ease  problems  of  overcapacity.  However,  industry 
is  just  one  part  of  the  equation  the  Congress  must  consider.  We  must  also  weigh 
the  extent  to  which  consolidation  is  in  the  best  interest  of  consumers,  particularly 
since  the  impact  of  decreased  capacity  on  travelers  and  local  communities  is  less 
clear.  Multiple  mergers  would  reduce  air  service  where  combined  route  structures 
overlap  significantly,  and  consequently  allow  industry  to  raise  fares  and  maintain 
much higher fares. Both of these consequences—fewer options and sustained higher 
prices—hurt  the  consumer.  Further,  airline  workers,  who  have  already  given  so 
much  in  wage  and  benefit  cuts  during  the  past  5  years,  would  have  to  compete  for 
the fewer jobs that remain after consolidation of the fleet. 

In the coming months, the Commerce Committee will be working on a significant 
reauthorization  of  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA).  We  will  continue  to 
closely  follow  the  state  of  the  industry  and  the  impact  of  airline  mergers  on  the 
American  public.  If  the  benefits  of  consolidation  are  less  than  promised,  we  will 
have  to  consider  addressing  this  matter  in  the  context  of  the  FAA  reauthorization 
legislation we plan to develop this Congress.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  [presiding]  I  thank  the  Committee  Full 

Chairman, will the Committee Full Chairman be waiting? 

I do not have an opening statement, I’m going to encourage other 
members to just insert an opening statement into the record so we 
can get right to Senator Isakson, and get right to the witnesses. 

Will  the  Chairman  be  able  to  ask  the  first  round  of  questions? 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Good. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  But  I’m  just  going  to  put  my  statement  in  the 

record. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  As  I  will.  I  will  put  my  statement  in  the 
record.  I  hope  all  members  will  put  their  statement  in  the  record, 
and thus will save us some time. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Mr.  Chairman,  could  we  just  have  unanimous 

consent that all members may file an opening statement? 

The CHAIRMAN. Is there any objection to that? 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. That’s a better idea. 
The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

We are approaching the thirtieth year of airline deregulation. Airline deregulation 
changed  the  very  nature  of  air  travel  in  this  country.  For  millions  of  Americans  in 
large  urban  areas,  it  ushered  in  an  era  of  affordable  air  travel,  but  for  hundreds 
of  small  communities,  including  all  of  West  Virginia’s,  deregulation  meant  a  loss  of 
service  and  convenience,  and  often  higher  prices.  It  seemed  to  me  that  the  big  jets 
disappeared from West Virginia within days of deregulation. 

Deregulation brought dramatic change to the airline industry. The only constants 
deregulation brought to the airline industry was brutal competition and financial in-
stability. Legendary airlines such as Pan Am, Eastern Airlines, and TWA could not 
survive the competitive onslaught that deregulation brought nor could many others. 
However,  deregulation  allowed  airlines  like  Southwest  and  other  low-cost  carriers 
to  thrive  and  provide  consumers,  mostly  in  large  markets,  lower  fares  and  more 
choices. 

In  the  industry’s  frequent  periods  of  financial  trouble,  airlines  either  merged  or 
went  out  of  business.  It  comes  as  no  surprise  that  after  the  last  several  years  of 
serious  financial  difficulty  that  the  industry  is  on  the  precipice  of  consolidation 
again. With the proposed merger of US Airways, the product of a recent combination 
of US Airways and America West Airlines itself, and Delta Air Lines, all other leg-
acy airlines would likely seek partnerships of their own. 

However, the consolidation this time would be different and have far greater con-
sequences.  In  previous  rounds  of  consolidation,  regional  carriers  merged  to  create 
larger  airlines  to  allow  them  to  compete  or  healthy  carriers  bought  the  assets  of 
weak  carriers.  No  one  merger  threatened  the  competitive  balance  of  the  industry. 
If  the  largest  carriers  in  the  industry  decided  to  merge,  our  Nation  would  have  a 
dramatically different aviation market. We would go from having six major network 
carriers to three, which would have major policy implications for this country, espe-
cially in the area of small community air service. 

There  is  no  question  that  our  airline  industry  is  just  emerging  from  one  of  the 
most difficult periods in its history. U.S. air carriers are beginning to see the results 
of  ongoing  cost  reduction  efforts  and  increased  passenger  flow.  The  Air  Transport 
Association,  the  primary  trade  organization  of  the  Nation’s  airlines,  recently  pro-
jected an aggregate net profit of $2 billion to $3 billion for 2006, and more than $4 
billion  aggregate  net  profit  in  2007  on  operating  revenues  exceeding  $150  billion. 
Despite  this  recent  economic  upturn  in  the  industry,  we  must  remember  that  be-
tween 2001 and 2005, the domestic U.S. airline industry posted $35 billion in cumu-
lative net losses. The poor financial performance of air carriers over this period was 
heavily exacerbated by a number of external factors, beginning with the September

11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which precipitated a dramatic slowdown in air passenger 
traffic. 

We  must  also  remember  that  this  return  to  profitability  has  not  come  without  a 
price.  The  legacy  carriers  have  aggressively  sought  to  cut  costs  by  reducing  labor 
expenditures  and  by  decreasing  capacity  through  cuts  to  flight  frequency,  use  of 
smaller  aircraft,  or  the  elimination  of  service  to  some  communities.  Airlines  cut  al-
most  140,000  jobs  in  the  last  5  years.  Those  employees  who  kept  their  jobs  did  so 
by  accepting  billions  of  dollars  in  wage  and  benefit  reductions.  The  airlines  have 
used  bankruptcy  to  terminate  defined-benefit  pension  plans,  costing  the  Pension 
Benefit Guarantee Corporation and airline employees billions of dollars. 

There is clearly a strong probability that air fares will continue to go up in a num-
ber  of  markets.  Consolidation  may  accelerate  this  trend.  No  one  wants  to  advocate 
for  higher  air  fares  for  consumers,  but  for  too  long,  the  competitive  environment 
that  carriers  faced  forced  them  to  offer  their  services  at  an  unrealistic  cost.  Finan-
cially weak carriers may produce benefits for consumers who have choices, but they 
are devastating for small communities. 

As  we  all  know,  small  and  rural  communities  are  the  first  to  bear  the  brunt  of 
bad  economic  times  and  the  last  to  see  the  benefits  of  good  times.  The  general  eco-
nomic  downturn  in  the  aviation  industry  over  the  last  5  years  has  placed  excep-
tional  burdens  on  air  service  to  our  most  isolated  communities.  In  West  Virginia, 
Tri-State  Airport  in  Huntington  lost  service  to  Pittsburgh  and  Atlanta,  the  Har-
rison-Marion  Regional  Airport  in  Clarksburg  lost  service  to  Cincinnati  and  Wash-
ington, D.C. 

As  the  Government  Accountability  Office  has  noted,  most  small  communities’ 
service  levels  remain  far  below  their  pre-September  11th  levels  despite  the  airlines 
increasing  capacity  levels.  West  Virginia  has  five  communities  that  currently  only 
have  one  air  carrier.  The  proposed  merger  between  US  Airways  and  Delta  would 
put 100 percent of West Virginia’s second largest airport, Tri-State, and over 60 per-
cent  of  our  largest  airport,  Yeager  Airport,  into  the  hands  of  into  the  hands  of  one 
company.  Because  of  the  lack  of  competition  in  many  West  Virginia  markets,  air 
service options are extremely limited and fares are high. 

The  airline  industry’s  restructuring  has  been  brutal  and  it  may  not  be  over.  Al-
though there is a positive outlook for the immediate future, the long-term financial 
outlook  for  the  industry  is  still  uncertain  at  best.  The  industry  has  enormous  debt 
levels, fuel prices are vulnerable to spiking upward, and newly found pricing power 
may collapse as competition increases. 

Over the last 2 years, I have met with almost every major airline Chief Executive 
Officer  (CEO).  I  have  heard  most  of  them  advocate  for  consolidation  within  the  in-
dustry.  I  am  not  unilaterally  opposed  to  consolidation,  but  I  believe  that  every 
transaction  has  to  be  considered  on  its  own  merits.  I  know  that  our  Nation  needs 
a  financially  healthy  airline  industry.  Air  service  to  small  communities  in  my  state 
and  across  the  country  depends  on  network  carriers  who  use  hub-and-spoke  oper-
ations.  We  do  not  have  any  other  options.  Low-cost  carriers  are  not  going  to  serve 
West Virginia’s communities because they are too small. 

Our  hearing  today  will  allow  to  examine  the  potential  impact  another  round  of 
consolidation  would  have  on  the  airline  industry  and  the  communities  and  con-
sumers they serve. Given that this proposed merger between US Airways and Delta 
Air  Lines  could  set  off  a  round  of  industry  consolidation,  this  Committee  needs  to 
understand  the  effects  consolidation  would  have  on  competition  and  small  commu-
nity air service. 

My  state  needs  healthy  network  carriers  if  we  are  to  attract  new  air  service.  At 
present,  low-cost  carriers  are  not  going  to  fill  the  service  void  in  our  markets.  Con-
gress and the Administration need to develop policies that promote competition but 
also  make  sure  all  communities  have  access  to  affordable  air  service.  Balancing 
these competing values will not be easy. 

As much as I believe that regulating the airline industry again is necessary, I rec-
ognize that we are not going back. The industry is far too changed and far too global 
for  us  to  return  to  a  completely  regulated  environment.  However,  I  am  becoming 
increasingly  convinced  that  some  regulation  may  become  an  option  to  make  sure 
small communities are not harmed by consolidation. 

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. I know that the future of the 

airline industry will be a continuing issue for this Committee. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I’d like to now introduce Senator Isakson 
for  whom  I  have  a  particularly  high  regard,  for  reasons  which  he 
knows,  and  I  know  and  many  folks  in  Appalachia  know.  And  he

asked  if  he  could  make  a  statement,  and  I  was  more  than  happy 
to allow him to do that. 

Senator Isakson, you may proceed. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHNNY ISAKSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA 

Senator  ISAKSON.  Thank  you  Chairman  Rockefeller,  Chairman 
Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens.  I  appreciate  you  giving  me  this 
courtesy. I asked to do this today because I wanted to introduce the 
President and CEO of Delta Air Lines. 

I  wanted  to  introduce  him  for  a  couple  of  reasons.  He’s  a  very 
humble man, and I was afraid he wasn’t going to tell you all of the 
great  things  about  what  he  and  Delta  Air  Lines  and  employees 
have done during difficult times. 

But second, I think it’s important to have a perspective into why 
the  Commerce  Committee  is  looking  into  the  state  of  aviation  in 
this country, and what has gotten us to the point that we are. 

My  background  in  this  is  not  just  by  being  from  Atlanta  and 
knowing  Delta.  My  background  is,  in  the  6  years  preceding  my 
election to the U.S. Senate, I served on the Aviation Committee in 
the  House.  I  was  there,  and  saw  the  after-effects  of  9/11  on  the 
aviation  industry,  watched  with  horror  what  happened  in  that  af-
fair.  Watched  further  as  gas  prices  spiraled,  and  the  cost  of  run-
ning  of  an  airline  spiraled  out  of  sight,  with  little  or  no  control. 
And  I  watched  a  great  airline,  Delta,  go  through  very  difficult 
times, as did every airline in the aviation business. I watched them 
go  to  the  depths,  and  I’ve  watched  them  now  come  back  to  the 
heights of what everybody would hope would happen. 

Delta  Air  Lines,  under  the  leadership  of  Jerry  Grinstein,  have 
done  some  truly  amazing  things.  When  the  company  went  into 
bankruptcy,  it  had  heavy  debt,  it  had  many,  many  problems  with 
contracts,  it  had  many,  many  problems  with  costs,  it  had  many, 
many  challenges  with  configuration  of  aircraft,  and  it  had  many 
ways in which it could go. But Jerry Grinstein decided it would go 
one way, and that’s up. And he joined with his employees, together 
as equals, to make this airline back into one of the truly great air-
lines of the United States of America. 

Jerry  Grinstein  has  a  great  history  in  transportation.  He  was 
President  of  Burlington-Northern,  and  presided  over  the  largest 
merger  to  create  the  largest  railroad  in  the  country,  when  they 
purchased Santa Fe. 

Before that, he ran Western Airlines as President and CEO. And 
his most important accomplishment, I think this Committee would 
recognize,  is  he  was  Chief  Counsel  to  the  Commerce  Committee  of 
the U.S. Senate, preceding those accomplishments. 

Delta  Air  Lines  has,  in  a  short  period  of  time  under  his  leader-
ship,  emerged  as  a  great  airline.  It  went  into  bankruptcy  with  the 
goal  of  emerging  competitive  and  strong,  and  honoring  its  commit-
ments  to  its  employees,  and  to  its  customers.  Delta  Air  Lines  has 
cut  its  costs,  reconfigured  its  aircraft,  aggressively  gone  into  inter-
national  markets,  made  its  fares  more  affordable,  and  the  attitude 
of  its  employees  give  it  one  of  the  highest  service  rankings  of  any 
airline in the industry.

That doesn’t happen by accident, and it particularly doesn’t hap-
pen  when  someone’s  in  bankruptcy.  It  happens  when  a  company 
comes  together  and  decides  on  greatness.  Delta  has  joined  in  that 
greatness. 

As  you  look  around  this  room  today,  you’ll  see  pilots,  flight  at-
tendants,  rank-and-file  employees  up  and  down,  here  to  support 
their President, and that airline. And it should not go unnoticed on 
behalf  of  the  U.S.  Senate,  that  it  was  Delta  Air  Lines  that  went 
into  bankruptcy,  wanting  to  emerge  with  a  commitment  to  honor 
its pensions to its rank-and-file employees. 

In an age where pension funds are more often than not jettisoned 
under the PBGC, Delta went into bankruptcy wanting to come out 
honoring  that  commitment.  With  the  help  of  the  Chairman  of  this 
Subcommittee,  the  Members  of  the  U.S.  Senate,  by  a  vote  of  95– 
3,  then-pension  rules  were  modified  in  this  country,  and  Delta  Air 
Lines is honoring that commitment today, and it’s not on the backs 
of the taxpayers of the United States of America. 

All  of  that  has  happened  under  the  quiet,  calm  and  dedicated 
leadership  of  a  great  president  of  a  great  airline.  Delta  Air  Lines. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to introduce Jerry 
Grinstein,  and  tell  his  story.  And  like  most  everybody  in  Atlanta, 
Georgia,  and  like  the  buttons  all  of  these  employees  wear,  when 
you’re  from  Atlanta,  you  feel  like  Delta  Air  Lines  is  your  airline. 
They’ve  done  a  wonderful  job.  They  deserve  to  emerge  from  bank-
ruptcy and compete again as the airline they have always been. 

And  I  thank  the  Chairman,  the  Vice  Chairman,  and  all  of  you 

for your attention, and your courtesy in holding this hearing. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Thank  you,  Senator  Isakson.  And  I  must 
comment  that  in  my  several  years  on  the  Committee,  I’ve  never 
known such an eloquent speech to be given without the advantage 
of a single note. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ISAKSON. Poor eyesight. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  The  second  panel  will  consist  of  Andrew 
Steinberg, who is Assistant Secretary of Aviation and International 
Affairs,  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation;  Mr.  Doug  Parker, 
Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  US  Airways;  Mr.  Gerald 
Grinstein,  who  is  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Delta  Air  Lines;  Mr. 
Robert  Roach,  Jr.,  General  Vice  President,  Transportation,  The 
International  Association  of  Machinists  and  Aerospace  Workers; 
and, Dr. Mark Cooper, who is Director of Research, Consumer Fed-
eration of America. 

If you gentlemen could come forward as quickly as possible. I will 
ask  that  you  try  to  hold  your  remarks  to  5  minutes.  That’s  asking 
a  lot,  but  we  need  to  have  that  to  move  forward—we  have  a  vote 
coming up at 11:30, that is very disruptive, as the Senate often is— 
and I wanted to give members a chance to ask you questions. 

Mr. Steinberg, we’ll start with you.

STATEMENT  OF  HON.  ANDREW  B.  STEINBERG,  ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY  FOR  AVIATION  AND  INTERNATIONAL  AFFAIRS, 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Mr.  STEINBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  Members  of 
the Committee, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to ap-
pear today at this timely and important hearing. 

Before  I  share  our  thoughts  about  the  state  of  the  industry  and 
the  role  of  consolidation  and  industry  restructuring,  I’d  like  to 
briefly  explain  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  role  in  review-
ing proposed mergers and acquisitions in the airline industry. 

While we closely monitor all such transactions, and review them 
to  assess  their  effect  on  domestic  competition,  airline  economic  fit-
ness,  safety,  international  alliances,  and  route  authorities,  as  well 
as  customer  service,  it  is  the  Department  of  Justice  that  retains 
primary antitrust jurisdiction. Of course, we work closely with Jus-
tice, and we share our findings with them, but the decision wheth-
er to challenge a particular transaction under the antitrust laws is 
the province of the Antitrust Division. 

Having  said  that,  we  at  DOT  obviously  take  a  keen  interest  in 
all such proposals, given their potential impact on the national air 
transportation system. 

The  U.S.  airline  industry  is  at  something  of  a  crossroads.  The 
last several years, as Senator Isakson noted, marked, perhaps, the 
most  trying  period  in  the  history  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry  since 
deregulation.  The  attacks  of  September  11,  the  war  on  terror,  the 
resulting new security burdens, SARS, and of course the markedly 
higher  cost  of  fuel,  have  all  made  running  an  airline  a  much  more 
challenging endeavor than ever before, and that’s saying a lot. 

But  thanks,  in  part,  to  the  sacrifices  of  airline  stakeholders,  in-
cluding  employees,  suppliers  and  creditors,  through  multiple 
rounds  of  bankruptcy,  it  appears  that  the  industry  is  poised  to  re-
turn to broad-based profitability in 2007. 

It’s a remarkable story. In the past 5 years, our network carriers 
slashed  their  annual  non-fuel  costs  by  nearly  $20  billion,  and  im-
proved  their  productivity  by  30  percent.  Yet,  during  the  same  pe-
riod  of  time,  air  travel  has  also  become  safer,  cheaper  and  more 
abundant  than  ever  before.  And  the  good  news  for  consumers  is 
that  the  very  circumstances  that  have  kept  fares  low  in  the  past, 
are now, I think, pervasive in the marketplace and should endure, 
even  if  we  see  some  restructuring,  and  even  as  consolidation 
unfolds, and that’s good for competition. 

What  are  these  factors?  Well,  they  include  the  continued  growth 
of low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines in the domestic market, 
and the competitive responses that they unleash; the availability of 
essentially perfect price information for consumers via the Internet; 
and  the  lower  cost  structures  that  have  now  made  profits  possible 
even in a lower fare environment. And the proof is in the pudding, 
as  they  say.  The  average  price  of  a  ticket  for  an  industry  average 
trip of 882 miles has actually fallen since 2000, from $125 to $109, 
and this despite, again, the dramatic increase in fuel prices. 

The recent encouraging financial results of our airlines, both net-
work,  and  most  of  the  low-cost  point-to-point  carriers  suggests  we 
are  in  something  of  an  equilibrium,  in  which  the  industry  can 
produce very low fares, and abundant service options in most parts

of the country, while enjoying modest profitability. The question is, 
over  the  long-term,  can  we  sustain  that  balance?  And  to  do  so,  I’d 
like to just note several problems. 

First, our network carriers remain very highly leveraged, despite 
having  shed  a  great  deal  of  debt  in  the  past  5  years  while  in,  or 
near, bankruptcy. Second, industry results are still heavily depend-
ent on even minor fluctuations in the two largest cost inputs, which 
are  fuel  and  labor.  Third,  several  of  our  biggest,  and  potentially 
most  lucrative,  international  markets  are  still  not  open  to  our  car-
riers,  at  least  not  entirely,  and  these  include  routes  to  the  United 
Kingdom,  China,  Japan,  and  parts  of  Latin  America.  Fourth, 
anachronistic  restrictions  on  cross-border  investment  artificially 
hamper  the  ability  of  our  airlines  to  capitalize  on  their  inherent 
network strengths, and operate as global companies. Fifth, the con-
tinuous cycle of failure and domestic bankruptcy in the last several 
years in the United States has obviously been damaging to the in-
dustry  as  a  whole;  and  that  means  our  carriers  must  play  catch- 
up,  in  terms  of  renewing  their  fleets,  investing  in  technology  and 
enhancing  their  products.  Sixth,  our  air  traffic  system  is  becoming 
increasingly  outmoded,  and  cannot  support  the  near-tripling  of  ca-
pacity that we think is needed to meet the growth and demand for 
air transportation in the next two decades. 

Now,  the  question  of  consolidation  and  industry  structure,  I 
think,  should  be  considered  in  the  context  of  dealing  with  all  of 
these  problems,  and  what  emerges  to  us  from  this  picture,  is  an 
overriding policy goal of having a healthy domestic airline industry 
that can broadly serve the needs of the public. 

While the focus of this hearing is on mergers, industry consolida-
tion, of course, can take a number of different forms, not just M&A 
activities,  but  also  asset  sales  of  airplanes,  gates  and  routes,  or 
even market exit. The Department of Transportation does not nec-
essarily  view  mergers  as  a  panacea  to  industry  problems.  Mergers 
are  complex  and  demanding  endeavors  that  have  a  poor  track 
record  in  the  airline  industry  because  they’re  difficult  to  execute. 
But some have been successful. 

At  the  same  time,  all  major  airlines  today  are,  in  fact,  the  prod-
uct  of  at  least  one  merger,  including  both  Delta,  and  obviously  US 
Airways. 

Consolidation  itself,  we  think,  is  part  of  the  natural  evolution  of 
any  business,  and  is  an  inevitable  by-product  of  having  a  deregu-
lated industry. While I can’t comment on any specific transaction— 
and,  in  fact,  none  is  pending  right  now  for  our  review—I  can  say 
what our goals would be in reviewing proposed mergers. 

In addition to the obvious one—— 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Mr.  Steinberg,  if  I  can  interrupt.  What 
you  have  to  say  is  extremely  important,  but  you  should  know  that 
you’re  already  over  the  time  limit,  and  simply  to  be  fair  to  all  the 
others to be able to speak, try and wrap up. 

Mr. STEINBERG. I’m almost done, Senator, thank you. 
While  I  can’t  comment  on  a  specific  transaction,  I  will  tell  you 
about the goals we will pursue in examining proposed mergers. Ob-
viously, one is low fares. But also our interests include encouraging 
the  use  of  market  forces  to  encourage  efficient  and  well-managed 
carriers  to  earn  adequate  profits  and  attract  capital,  ensuring  con-

sumers  in  all  regions  of  the  United  States  have  access  to  afford-
able, regularly scheduled air transportation, and strengthening the 
competitive  position  of  U.S.  carriers,  to  ensure,  at  least,  equality 
with  foreign  air  carriers.  There’s  no  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’  way  to  view 
airline mergers. And so, I think when it comes to consolidation, we 
have to keep an open mind toward any and all proposals. 

I think I’ll stop there. Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Steinberg follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR 

AVIATION AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Stevens, and members of the Committee: 

Introduction 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  to  discuss  the  state  of  the 
U.S.  airline  industry,  the  role  of  the  Federal  Government  in  the  industry’s  ongoing 
restructuring,  and  the  prospect  of  consolidation.  This  is  an  important  and  timely 
hearing. Although I cannot discuss the specifics of any potential merger transaction, 
I  can  shed  some  light  on  our  outlook  for  the  industry,  the  role  of  consolidation  in 
the context of a deregulated business, and the process the Department of Transpor-
tation  will  use  in  reviewing  an  airline  merger  should  a  transaction  be  presented  to 
us. 
State  of  the  U.S.  Airline  Industry:  Short-Term  Recovery,  Long-Term 

Challenges 

Let  me  begin  with  the  state  of  the  airline  industry.  The  U.S.  airline  industry  re-
mains in the midst of an historic restructuring. Over the last 5 years, U.S. network 
airlines  have  reduced  their  annualized  mainline  costs  excluding  fuel  by  more  than 
25  percent,  or  nearly  $20  billion.  While  some  of  the  cost  savings  were  the  product 
of identifying greater operational efficiencies, most of the savings were generated by 
renegotiation  of  existing  contractual  arrangements  with  creditors,  aircraft  lessors, 
suppliers and airline employees and achieved either through the bankruptcy process 
itself or under threat of bankruptcy. 22 percent of industry capacity is still operated 
in bankruptcy—down from a high of 46 percent in 2005 but still substantial by any 
measure. The result is that several carriers that were on the precipice of liquidation 
just  5  years  ago  now  have  much  lower  cost  structures  that  should  allow  them  to 
return to profitability over the short term. 

The financial crisis that necessitated this massive restructuring and the sacrifices 
of  our  largest  airlines  and  their  employees  was  produced  by  the  confluence  of  in-
tense  competition,  structural  conditions  in  the  industry,  and  a  series  of  exogenous 
events  that  temporarily  depressed  air  travel  demand  or  increased  costs  (e.g.,  the 
September 11th terrorist attacks, the war on terror, greater security burdens, SARS, 
and  much  higher  fuel  prices).  During  this  difficult  period  certain  sectors  of  the  in-
dustry  fared  relatively  better  than  the  network  airlines,  including  low-cost  and  re-
gional carriers and cargo/express operators. 

In  addition  to  geopolitical  challenges,  the  industry  has  also  found  pricing  to  be 
increasingly competitive. Low-cost carriers (LCC’s) increased their share of the mar-
ket  from  23  percent  to  30  percent  during  this  time  period,  bringing  prices  down  on 
many  origin-destination  routes  (‘‘citypairs’’)  to  the  benefit  of  air  travel  consumers. 
At  the  same  time,  the  percentage  of  business  travelers  willing  to  pay  substantially 
higher  ‘‘walk  up’’  or  unrestricted  fares  has  steadily  fallen.  These  trends  have  been 
enhanced by the growth of the Internet as a mainstream marketing and distribution 
channel, creating an environment of nearly perfect price information for both leisure 
and  business  travelers,  further  curtailing  the  ability  of  network  carriers  to  charge 
significantly  higher  prices  to  the  most  time-sensitive  passengers.  As  a  result,  aver-
age  yields  fell  from  14.2  cents  per  revenue  passenger  mile  (RPM)  in  2000  to  11.1 
cents  in  2005,  before  bouncing  back  to  12.4  cents  in  2006.  To  put  that  in  more  un-
derstandable terms, the decline means that the price of a ticket for an industry-av-
erage, 882-mile trip has declined from $125 to $109. 

This  decline  in  average  fares  came  despite  the  dramatic  increase  in  the  price  of 
jet  fuel  over  the  past  18  months.  Prior  to  their  recent  moderation,  fuel  prices  more 
than  doubled  from  approximately  $1.03/gal  jet  kerosene  in  mid-2004  to  over  $2.23/ 
gal in mid-2005 and remained near $1.91/gal throughout much of 2006. Jet kerosene 
is  now  $1.62/gal  in  the  spot  market,  brought  down  by  the  very  recent  declines  in 
the price of crude oil from which jet kerosene is derived. Fuel is now either the first

or  second  largest  expense  category  depending  on  the  airline,  representing  on  aver-
age  about  26  percent  of  cost.  Each  one-cent  increase  in  the  price  of  a  gallon  of  fuel 
translates into an additional $193 million annual expense for the industry. U.S. air-
lines  have  responded  to  the  challenge  of  high  and  increasing  fuel  prices  with  oper-
ational  and  technological  changes  that  have  cut  fuel  consumption  during  the  past 
5 years, resulting in cost savings for the airlines, and cuts in emissions that benefit 
the  environment.  Nevertheless,  fuel  prices  present  a  major  challenge  to  the  health 
of  the  industry  in  an  environment  in  which  airlines  are  obviously  not  able  to  pass 
on  the  full  brunt  of  these  higher  costs  to  their  customers.  In  effect,  the  growth  in 
the fuel expense burden has masked the tremendous progress made by network car-
riers  in  cutting  their  costs  to  levels  that  are  much  more  competitive  with  low-cost/ 
low-fare  carriers.  Thus,  on  the  positive  side,  if  the  very  recent  moderation  in  fuel 
prices  continues,  the  industry  is  poised  to  reap  material  financial  benefit  in  the 
short  term,  although  again  it  is  unlikely  they  would  realize  the  full  benefit  of  such 
savings. Overall, fuel price uncertainty will continue to motivate industry-wide cost 
discipline. 

Airlines have focused on six areas of cost reductions: 
• Labor—Taking  a  clear  view  of  the  necessity  of  cost  reductions,  labor  and  man-
agement have negotiated contracts that have generated major savings. In some 
cases, those reductions have been imposed through the bankruptcy process. U.S. 
network  carriers  have  reduced  their  annualized  labor  costs  by  over  $11  billion 
over the last 5 years. 
• Fuel—Fuel  saving  initiatives  such  as  single-engine  taxiing,  more  efficient  fuel- 
reserve  practices,  and  installation  of  winglets  have  resulted  in  significant  cost 
savings. 
• IT/Reservations/Customer  Service—Technology-driven  enhancements  to  airline 
websites and self-service kiosks have not only reduced the cost of bookings and 
passenger  handling,  but  have  also  improved  the  ability  of  carriers  to  generate 
additional  revenue  at  the  airport  from  passengers  willing  to  trade-up  to  pre-
mium  services  such  as  service  class  upgrades,  one-day  admission  to  airport 
lounges, or even exit-row seating. 
• External  Distribution/Commissions—The  airlines  renegotiated  contracts  with 
global  distributions  systems  (GDS),  further  reduced  travel  agent  commissions, 
and successfully induced travelers to book directly with carrier websites, which 
have  resulted  in  substantial  annualized  air  carrier  savings.  GDS  booking  fees 
have declined approximately 15 percent since mid-2003. 
• Fleet/Maintenance—Fleet rationalization continues at a number of airlines both 
inside  and  outside  of  bankruptcy.  Carriers  are  retiring  older,  maintenance-in-
tensive, fuel-guzzling fleets with new aircraft that in many cases allow for com-
mon type-ratings, thus reducing training, spares, and maintenance expense. 
• Pension—Bankruptcy  has  allowed  several  carriers  to  significantly  reduce  pen-
sion  expenses.  Furthermore,  recent  pension  legislation  will  lessen  funding  re-
quirements,  thereby  improving  cash-flow.  The  result  has  been  to  shift  to  the 
Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  (PBGC)  an  increasingly  large  burden  of 
funding  the  pensions  of  airline  workers.  According  to  the  PBGC,  airline  pen-
sions today represent at least 38 percent of PBGC claims—but airlines paid just 
2.6 percent of premiums. 

For  2006,  according  to  Wall  Street  analysts,  the  industry  will  record  its  first  an-
nual profit since 2000, estimated to be $2 billion on revenues of nearly $123 billion, 
for an approximate return on sales of 2 percent. The industry is also forecast to post 
profits  this  year,  estimated  to  be  approximately  $6  billion  on  revenues  of  approxi-
mately $128 billion, or a 5 percent return. Over the short-term, network airlines are 
expected  to  maintain  capacity  and  cost  control.  If  the  recent  moderation  in  fuel 
prices  continues,  airlines  will  reap  even  more  financial  benefits  from  the  structural 
changes made in their business models. 

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  over  the  last  several  years  the  significant  and 
ongoing  expansion  in  the  scope  of  low-cost  carrier  operations  within  the  domestic 
market  has  not  only  resulted  in  lower  fares,  but  has  substantially  expanded  the 
availability  of  those  low  fare  offerings  much  more  broadly  than  ever  before.  Con-
sumers  in  many  markets  where  deeply  discounted  fares  were  either  unavailable  or 
offered  with  very  limited  capacity  now  have  a  low-cost  carrier  option—-and,  of 
course,  this  service  has  had  the  effect  of  reducing  the  fares  that  network  carriers 
offer  in  these  markets  as  well.  The  price  discipline  created  by  a  plethora  of  LCC 
offerings is pervasive. 

Short-term  prospects  for  the  industry  this  year  appear  quite  favorable  based  on 

the following factors:

riers. 

demand. 

• Positive revenue trends due to slower domestic capacity growth and very strong 
• Higher  average  yields  in  part  due  to  less  capacity  pressure  from  low-cost  car-
• Strong economic growth in the United States. 
• Continued cost discipline. 
• Improved balance sheets with encouraging levels of current free cash-flow. 
• Recent decline in fuel prices. 
With  a  favorable  supply-demand  dynamic  in  place  for  the  domestic  airline  indus-
try, we expect the positive revenue trend to continue in the near-term. On the sup-
ply  side  of  the  equation,  network  carrier  available  seat  miles  (ASMs)  are  expected 
to  increase  no  more  than  3  percent,  with  the  bulk  of  the  growth  in  international 
markets. In fact, network domestic capacity is expected to decline. Most capacity in-
creases will come from greater aircraft utilization, another sign of improved produc-
tivity. Conversely, according to analysts, domestic ASM growth for the low-cost car-
riers  will  continue  growing  over  10  percent,  resulting  in  continuing  share  gains  for 
LCCs in the domestic market. Overall, industry-wide domestic capacity is projected 
to  increase  2.6  percent.  On  the  demand  side  of  the  equation,  load  factors  have 
reached  record  levels,  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  airline  revenue  management 
systems, which should enable the network carriers in particular to improve the fare 
mix and thus overall revenues. 

Over the long term, however, the outlook for the U.S. airline industry is more un-
certain.  The  industry  faces  persistent  structural  problems  that  must  be  addressed 
if  we  are  to  avoid  facing  another  wave  of  bankruptcies  in  the  next  economic  down-
town,  and  if  the  industry  is  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  very  substantial  progress 
made in lowering unit costs. These problems are discussed below: 

First, many network carriers remain highly leveraged despite shedding significant 

debt while in or under the threat of bankruptcy. 

Second, the two biggest inputs into the industry’s cost structure—fuel and labor— 
are by no means fixed and thus the lower-cost foundation supporting break-even re-
sults in 2006 and modest profitability in 2007 is impermanent. With respect to labor 
costs, history suggests that organized groups will gradually seek to recoup the wage 
rate  reductions  acceded  to  in  economic  downturns  and  will  do  so  at  the  earliest 
stages  of  industry  recovery,  which  we  are  now  seeing.  With  respect  to  fuel,  given 
the  airlines’  inability  to  pass  on  the  full  impact  of  higher  fuel  prices  to  their  cus-
tomers, their bottom line remains quite sensitive to fluctuations. 

Third, several of the biggest and most important international markets still have 
unnecessary  constraints  on  competition—including  the  United  Kingdom,  China, 
Japan,  and  several  countries  in  Latin  America—that  effectively  protect  foreign  air-
lines and raise costs for U.S. carriers and consumers. 

Fourth, cross-border investment restrictions artificially raise the cost of capital to 
U.S.  carriers.  Those  restrictions  also  prevent  U.S.  carriers  from  optimizing  their 
business models and taking advantage in international flying of their inherent net-
work  strength  (a  result  of  operating  out  of  the  world’s  single  largest  aviation  mar-
ket) and their newly minted, lower cost structures. 

Fifth, the continuous cycle of domestic bankruptcies has required U.S. carriers to 
reduce  capital  expenditures  substantially  in  order  to  bolster  beleaguered  balance 
sheets.  This  has  meant  delaying  much  needed  investments  in  fleet  renewal,  new 
technologies,  and  product  enhancements  to  remain  competitive.  This  deficiency  is 
becoming increasingly serious, especially as our carriers must vie with foreign rivals 
that have surged ahead in making such investments. 

Finally,  any  discussion  of  the  structural  challenges  facing  the  U.S.  airline  indus-
try must also include mention of the apparent effects of the bankruptcy process not 
only  on  those  firms  that  are  forced  to  seek  protection  under  the  bankruptcy  code, 
but  also  on  the  rest  of  the  industry  that  attempts  to  operate  without  those  protec-
tions.  Respected  airline  industry  analysts  have  frequently  observed  that  the  airline 
industry  is,  paradoxically,  relatively  easy  to  enter  and  hard  to  leave—sometimes 
characterizing this phenomenon as an ‘‘exit barrier’’ for failed firms that is the inad-
vertent  consequence  of  the  Chapter  11  reorganization  process.  They  point  out  that 
airline stakeholders (lenders, suppliers and employees)—any one of whom could sin-
gly  cause  an  air  carrier’s  demise—rarely  force  such  an  outcome  and  instead  trade 
in old contractual arrangements and debt for new ones. And the net result of those 
decisions is, perversely enough, that those carriers who manage to avoid bankruptcy 
eventually find themselves at a serious competitive disadvantage. 

The  airline  industry  is  particularly  susceptible  to  this  phenomenon  because  the 
business  is  highly  responsive  to  economic  cycles.  Just  as  most  network  airlines  are

now expected to turn an operating profit, most lost substantial sums in the last sev-
eral  years;  when  one  carrier  finds  itself  in  trouble,  typically  most  others  do.  Con-
sequently, when one firm falls behind on its aircraft lease payments, its lessors may 
lack  the  economic  leverage  to  reclaim  assets  (because  they  cannot  redeploy  them 
profitably elsewhere)—and thus don’t. This is compounded by the ability of airlines 
operating  in  Chapter  11  to  win  significant  savings  on  their  leases  and  postpone  re-
confirmation  of  leases,  allowing  bankrupt  airline  managers  to  ‘‘time’’  the  bottom  of 
the  market  and  gain  a  capital  cost  advantage  over  their  competitors.  Airports  that 
are  reliant  on  large  airline  tenants  face  a  similar  bargaining  dynamic  in  difficult 
financial  times  for  the  industry  and  must  also  make  concessions  that  keep  failing 
companies afloat. Organized labor usually makes the same decision; that it is better 
to keep their employer alive even at much lower wage rates than suffer the job and 
retirement benefit losses of failure. Similarly, the liquidation of an airline will ordi-
narily leave a debtor far worse off than a restructuring in bankruptcy—even one in 
which  creditors  get  relatively  little  on  the  dollar—because  even  the  prospect  of  a 
major  airline  shutting  down  will  practically  halt  ticket  sales,  forcing  assets  to  be 
sold at ‘‘fire sale’’ prices. Yet precisely because of the underlying volatility of the in-
dustry,  the  airlines  in  effect  offer  a  huge  ‘‘option  value’’  to  their  stakeholders;  that 
is,  the  risk  of  continuing  to  invest  in  or  extend  credit  to  a  bankrupt  or  near-bank-
rupt  airline  is  outweighed  by  the  potential  reward  if  the  company  should  survive. 
All  of  this  ensures  that  even  failing  airlines  will  almost  always  have  access  to  cap-
ital, thus perpetuating the cycle of failure. 

While  these  structural  conditions  cloud  the  long-term  outlook  for  airlines,  once 
they  are  addressed,  the  industry  can  more  easily  meet  the  public’s  expectation  of 
low fares, reliable service for smaller communities, and innovative product offerings 
that are competitive in a global marketplace. Indeed, the role of international mar-
kets and the growth opportunities they now present for U.S. network airlines should 
not  be  underestimated.  I  am  confident  that  if  we  can  avoid  another  cycle  of  bank-
ruptcies,  there  is  every  reason  to  expect  U.S.  airlines  to  succeed  in  exploiting  their 
advantages to profit from the tremendous growth opportunities offered by the liber-
alization  of  international  aviation  markets  through  ‘‘Open  Skies’’  Agreements.  And 
ultimately,  this  will  redound  to  the  benefit  of  U.S.  consumers  in  the  form  of  more 
service to more destinations at lower fares. 
Role  of  Government:  Consolidation 

the  Context  of  Complete 

in 

Deregulation 

These  observations  about  the  short-  and  long-term  state  of  the  airline  industry 
necessarily  implicate  the  question  of  the  appropriate  role  of  government  in  the  in-
dustry’s  ongoing  restructuring.  By  deregulating  the  airline  industry  in  1978,  Con-
gress  set  the  U.S.  Government  permanently  on  the  path  away  from  intervention  in 
the  marketplace.  This  was  a  wise  choice.  The  Department  of  Transportation  has 
long  believed  that  deregulation  has  been  a  success  in  producing  widespread  service 
with  low  fares,  while  achieving  a  spectacular  safety  record.  The  American  people 
continue  to  enjoy  the  most  abundant,  most  reliable,  safest,  and  most  affordable  air 
transportation  in  our  Nation’s  history.  Noting  the  success  of  airline  deregulation, 
Congress  went  on  to  deregulate  motor  carriers,  railroads,  electricity,  energy,  tele-
communications,  and  financial  services.  As  governments  around  the  world  have  in-
creasingly  opted  for  market-based  approaches,  deregulation  has  become  the  default 
policy of the global economy. 

As we examine developments in the airline industry and consider the appropriate 
policy  response  toward  them,  the  Department  of  Transportation  strives  to  apply  a 
‘‘value-added’’ test for regulatory burdens. Simply put, at a time when the industry 
is  buffeted  by  so  many  forces—some  attributable  to  the  marketplace,  some  to  geo-
political challenges—government needs to ensure that each of its regulatory require-
ments  continues  to  serve  a  valid  public  purpose,  and  the  interests  of  the  American 
people and the U.S. economy. 

The Bush Administration has been applying that test rigorously, and finding ways 
to  reduce  further  the  regulatory  burden  while  protecting  the  traveling  public.  For 
example, we eased the requirements on airports relating to the filing of competition 
plans. We repealed in their entirety DOT’s 20-year-old regulations governing the use 
of  computer  reservation  systems.  We  created  an  expedited,  simplified  procedure  to 
award  ‘‘route  integration  authority’’  for  5  years  to  all  U.S.  carriers  who  apply  for 
it.  We  have  eased  tariff  filing  requirements  for  the  airlines  of  countries  with  which 
the  U.S.  enjoys  a  liberal  aviation  relationship.  And  we  simplified  the  requirement 
for  disclosure  of  code-share  and  long-term  wet  lease  arrangements  in  print  adver-
tising. 

Our  efforts  to  get  unnecessary  government  constraints  out  of  the  way  of  innova-
tion are further evidenced by our persistent pursuit of liberalized bilateral air serv-

ices agreements, adhering to the Open Skies model wherever possible. Working with 
the Department of State, and with the support of other agencies, we now have over 
70 Open Skies partners. The U.S. Government has thereby created new commercial 
opportunities  for  U.S.  carriers  while  bringing  the  benefits  of  affordable  air  travel 
across the world to American consumers and to foreign citizens desirous of spending 
money here. 

We  need  to  fully  understand  the  problems  affecting  airlines  and  should  take  ad-
vantage of the current environment—in which the domestic airline industry appears 
to be in the midst of a robust cyclical recovery—by completing the work of deregula-
tion. If we want a sustained recovery and the benefits that will bring to consumers 
we  need  to  ensure  that  government  does  not  purposefully  or  inadvertently  prevent 
the  industry  from  undertaking  the  restructuring  demanded  by  market  forces.  This 
may necessitate a reexamination of regulatory and policy assumptions in key areas 
like bankruptcy, pension funding, labor relations, and aviation infrastructure financ-
ing  and  development.  Our  policies  in  each  of  these  areas  undoubtedly  come  with 
burdens and benefits not only for the flying public, but also for taxpayers, investors, 
and employees. We need to better understand the aggregate impact of these policies 
and  ensure  that  they  do  not  inadvertently  create  obstacles  to  an  efficient  and  com-
petitive industry in the long run. 

This  same  philosophy  will  inform  the  Department’s  approach  to  larger  policy 
questions  involving  the  issue  of  ‘‘consolidation.’’  The  history  of  deregulation  has 
shown quite clearly that American travelers and shippers can support a mix of car-
rier  types  with  different  business  models.  The  challenge  we  face  is  to  ensure  that 
our  regulatory  regime  does  not  stand  in  the  way  of  marketplace  forces  that  would 
otherwise  result  in  new  entry,  business  combinations,  asset  sales  or  even  exit.  In 
a  dynamic  market,  new  entry  acts  as  a  force  that  disciplines  incumbents  and  thus 
ideally fosters innovation and efficiency. Just as new entrant firms must be afforded 
competitive  access  to  satisfy  marketplace  demands,  we  must  allow  failing  firms  to 
exit  the  business  if  market  forces  decide  that  assets  should  be  reallocated  to  more 
efficient  firms.  This  is  a  natural  consequence  of  a  deregulated  industry  and  the 
mechanism by which market forces ensure that the needs of American travelers and 
shippers are met in the most efficient way possible. 

Industry  consolidation—regardless  of  the  sector—fundamentally  occurs  in  three 
different  ways—through  the  combination  of  firms,  through  asset  sales,  or  through 
the exit of failed companies. Business combinations are not necessarily an elixir for 
any  industry,  much  less  the  domestic  airline  business.  Merging  two  air  carriers  is 
a  demanding  and  extremely  complex  endeavor  that  requires  effectively  combining 
route  networks,  information  technology  systems,  aircraft  fleets,  and  perhaps  most 
daunting, two different workforces. As a result of these many complexities, mergers 
usually  fail  in  the  airline  industry,  but  some  don’t,  and  we  should  be  open  to  both 
possibilities. 

Completing the work of deregulation—the centerpiece of our policy—means better 
understanding the role that applying our competition laws has played, if any, in im-
peding  market  forces  that  may  benefit  the  public  interest.  In  this  context,  it  is  im-
portant  to  emphasize  that  the  Department  of  Transportation  must  fulfill  a  broader 
set of statutory policy objectives than does competition law. While protecting the in-
terest  of  U.S.  consumers  in  having  access  to  low  airfares  remains  paramount,  Con-
gress  has  also  instructed  the  Secretary  of  Transportation,  in  carrying  out  the  De-
partment’s  responsibilities  to  consider  other  important  goals:  including  the  use  of 
marketplace forces to encourage efficient and well-managed air carriers to earn ade-
quate  profits  and  attract  capital,  to  ensure  that  consumers  in  all  regions  of  the 
United States have access to affordable, regularly scheduled air service, to promote 
a  viable,  privately-owned  United  States  air  transport  industry,  and  to  strengthen 
the  competitive  position  of  air  carriers  to  at  least  ensure  equality  with  foreign  air 
carriers. Our analysis of a proposed merger will necessarily be informed by all these 
considerations. 

However, before I leave this discussion on the role of government, I want to note 
that there is an important area where government can, and must, play a major role 
in driving change and innovation. Infrastructure constraints, and the resulting con-
gestion  problems  are  a  significant  long-term  difficultly  facing  the  airline  industry. 
Congestion problems are widespread: travelers are delayed, airlines incur additional 
costs,  and  economic  activity  reliant  on  air  service  is  slowed.  Air  traffic  is  expected 
to  approximately  triple  by  2025  and,  without  action,  congestion  will  become  crip-
pling. 

In  order  to  address  this  problem,  the  Department  of  Transportation  is  working 
along  side  several  other  Federal  agencies  including  the  Departments  of  Defense, 
Homeland  Security,  Commerce,  NASA,  and  the  White  House  Office  of  Science  and 
Technology  Policy  to  develop  the  Next  Generational  Air  Transportation  System,

what  is  known  as  ‘‘NextGen’’.  These  efforts,  spearheaded  by  the  Federal  Aviation 
Administration, are being coordinated through the Joint Planning and Development 
Office (JPDO), which is staffed by officials from all of these agencies. 

NextGen  promises  to  revolutionize  the  way  in  which  air  traffic  moves  by  using 
networked  information,  satellite-based  navigation,  enhanced  aircraft  capabilities, 
new  flight  procedures,  and  automation  among  other  things.  These  technologies  will 
allow more efficient use of physical aviation infrastructure, thus boosting the capac-
ity  of  our  system  and  facilitating  greater  economic  growth.  We  believe  that,  in  cre-
ating NextGen, the Federal Government is contributing an essential element to the 
long-term success of the U.S. airline industry. 
DOT’s Role in the Review of Merger Transactions 

Now that I’ve provided some insight into our perspective, let me explain how the 
review  process  within  the  Department  might  transpire  should  any  proposed  trans-
action move forward. 

In  addition  to  requiring  bankruptcy  court  approval,  the  proposed  merger  would 
be  reviewed  by  both  the  Antitrust  Division  of  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the 
Department of Transportation. The Antitrust Division is responsible for determining 
whether  the  transaction  will  be  challenged  under  the  antitrust  laws.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  would  conduct  its  own  competitive  analysis  of  the  proposed 
merger and by practice will submit its views and findings to the Antitrust Division 
privately. 

DOT  would  also  consider  a  wide  range  of  public  interest  issues  involving,  among 
other  things,  route  transfers,  economic  fitness,  code-sharing,  and  possible  unfair  or 
deceptive practices. In practice, we would not formally consider such issues until the 
Antitrust Division advised us that it did not intend to challenge the transaction. 

If a proposed transaction involved the acquisition of international routes, consum-
mating the merger might entail the transfer of certificate authority to a new entity. 
By  statute,  49  U.S.C.  41105,  we  may  approve  a  transfer  only  if  we  find  that  it  is 
consistent  with  the  public  interest.  We  must  analyze  the  transfer’s  impact  on  the 
viability of each airline party to the transaction, competition in the domestic airline 
industry, and the trade position of the United States in the international air trans-
portation  market.  As  a  practical  matter,  transfers  are  important  only  when  the  ac-
quired airline holds route authority in limited-entry markets. We would only decide 
whether to approve the transfer after we had established a formal record and given 
all  interested  persons  the  opportunity  to  comment.  Our  discussions  with  the  Anti-
trust  Division  on  a  proposed  merger  would  likely  include  a  discussion  of  the  com-
petitive effects of the transfer of any international routes. If the Department deter-
mines  that  the  transfer  would  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest  on  competitive 
grounds  or  for  another  reason,  the  Department  could  disapprove  the  transfer  in 
whole or part. Alternatively, the Department may condition its approval on require-
ments that would protect the public interest. 

Usually, a proposed merger will result in a new corporate entity under new own-
ership,  and  when  that  is  the  case,  the  Department  would  conduct  a  fitness  review, 
including  a  review  of  airline  management,  financials  and  compliance  disposition. 
The Department would also review any codeshare arrangements concluded between 
the  merging  carriers  under  49  U.S.C.  41720.  In  the  Department’s  experience,  code- 
share arrangements would likely be necessary during the early phases of integration 
post-merger. Meanwhile, the Department would also have to evaluate the impact of 
a merger on any domestic marketing agreements or international alliances. As U.S. 
airlines  participate  in  all  three  worldwide  alliances,  some  of  which  enjoy  antitrust 
immunity  from  the  Department  and  some  of  which  don’t,  we  would  need  to  review 
how the changes in alliance memberships affect airline competition. 

The  Department  has  the  obligation  under  49  U.S.C.  41712  to  protect  consumers 
from  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  by  airlines.  In  carrying  out  that  responsibility, 
we  could,  if  appropriate,  review  the  proposed  merger’s  arrangements  to  protect  the 
rights of consumers. For example, it could be necessary to assess whether the merg-
ing  airlines  plan  to  give  consumers  reasonable  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  adjust 
to any changes in the frequent flyer programs. 
Conclusion 

The  issue  of  ‘‘consolidation’’  should  thus  be  understood  in  the  broader  context  of 
allowing  deregulation  to  address  the  airline  industry’s  problems.  An  industry  that 
is  truly  subject  to  marketplace  forces  will  often  go  through  phases  of  restructuring 
or  consolidation.  This  can  occur  in  a  variety  of  forms—not  necessarily  just  mergers 
and  acquisitions.  The  airline  industry  is  very  dynamic.  Thus  government  policy 
should  evolve  in  parallel  constantly  taking  into  account  rapidly  changing  economic 
conditions,  competitive  environment,  and  industry  innovation.  The  government,  ab-

sent  a  clear  and  convincing  need  to  protect  the  traveling  public,  should  not  stand 
in the way of market forces acting to address structural problems within the indus-
try. 

To be sure, mergers are not a panacea for the industry’s long-term problems. Be-
cause  of  the  complexity  of  integrating  different  labor  forces  and  fleets,  many  merg-
ers in the airline industry have failed to fully achieve their creators’ objectives. But 
we should not assume that having fewer network carriers necessarily translates into 
detriment to consumers. To the contrary, an industry populated by several success-
ful  firms  could  contain  intense  and  diverse  forms  of  competition  as  we  can  see  in 
other  industries,  such  as  the  cargo/express  delivery  business  in  which  a  few  large 
firms compete vigorously not only on price but also on product innovation. 

Let  me  be  clear,  however.  My  remarks  today  should  not  be  interpreted  as  an  en-
dorsement  or  rejection  of  any  particular  transaction  or  combination  of  transactions, 
or of mergers as the optimal way to address the structural conditions that have im-
peded innovation. Each proposed transaction must and will be considered on a case- 
by-base  basis.  The  airline  industry  should  be  held  to  the  same  antitrust  standards 
as  every  other  industry  and  certainly  there  will  be  transactions  that  fail  to  satisfy 
a  rigorous  antitrust  test.  But  as  the  Department  of  Transportation  examines  such 
transactions,  it  will  do  so  with  a  variety  of  statutory  policy  objectives  in  mind,  not 
the least of which is our obligation to ensure a viable airline industry that can meet 
the transportation needs of the American people. 

Thank you, and I would be pleased to take any questions.

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Steinberg,  very  much. 
And  we  now  turn  to  Doug  Parker,  Chairman  and  CEO  of  US  Air-
ways. 

STATEMENT OF W. DOUGLAS PARKER, CHAIRMAN/CEO, 

US AIRWAYS GROUP 

Mr.  PARKER.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Stevens,  other 
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you very much for 
the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  some  of  the 
issues confronting our industry. 

I’m  Doug  Parker,  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  US 
Airways.  I  became  CEO  after  the  September  2005  merger  of  US 
Airways  and  America  West  Airlines.  I’m  very  proud  to  be  here 
today, representing our nearly 35,000 employees. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Could you move the microphone just a bit 

Mr. PARKER. I’ll try. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Mr.  PARKER.  It  has  been  5  years  since  I  addressed  Congress, 
shortly  after  the  tragic  events  of  September  11th,  and  the  airlines 
industry,  at  that  time,  was  in  a  precipitous  financial  tailspin.  But 
Members of this Committee, and others in Congress, stood with the 
industry  in  a  much-needed  show  of  support.  We  were  grateful  for 
your  leadership,  but  none  of  us  could  have  foreseen  the  severity 
and duration of the crisis that faced airlines. 

Oh, I needed to turn it on. That’s the first step. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. That would be helpful. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. PARKER. I told you it has been 5 years. 
Since  2001,  the  industry  has  experienced  24  Chapter  11  filings, 
and five liquidations, $35 billion in cumulative losses, and 154,000 
of our employees have lost their jobs. The severe impact of multiple 
shocks  to  the  aviation  industry  caused  us  to  repeatedly  come  back 
to Congress for help. 

While  you  did  help,  we  also  heard  the  message—and  appro-
priately  so—that  Federal  support  should  be  the  exception,  and  not

the rule. And that it was time, as an industry, that we got our own 
house  in  order.  At  America  West,  now  US  Airways,  we  took  that 
message to heart. We believed that if we aggressively managed our 
cost, and made things easier and simpler for customers, they would 
respond, and we would return to profitability. We were right. 

Consumers  responded  favorably.  So  much  so,  that  through  the 
hard  work  of  our  employees,  by  2004  we  had  returned  our  airline 
to  profitability.  In  2005,  we  merged  with  US  Airways,  a  leading 
East  Coast  carrier  that  was  then  facing  significant  financial  prob-
lems. We believed that a merger with US Airways presented an op-
portunity to strengthen our own company, provide a brighter future 
for nearly 35,000 employees of US Airways and America West, and 
a stronger airline for the communities and customers we served. 

At  the  time  of  the  merger,  we  faced  many  skeptics  who  did  not 
believe that this deal, or any other large scale airline merger could 
work. The results speak for themselves. 

Today,  the  new  US  Airways  is  the  most  profitable  network  car-
rier in the United States, with 2006 profits projected at better than 
$500 million. Our market capitalizations increased from about $150 
million to over $5 billion in just over a year. 

For our people, we combined a fragile America West and a failing 
US  Airways  into  a  strong,  viable  competitor,  and  saved  the  jobs  of 
over 30,000 hardworking, frontline employees. Not only did we not 
furlough  anyone,  but  since  the  merger,  we’ve  hired  4,000  new  em-
ployees. To be clear, these are baggage handlers, flight attendants, 
pilots—who  not  only  did  not  lose  their  jobs,  but  will  benefit  from 
approximately  $58  million  in  profit-sharing  payments  to  be  paid 
this quarter. 

With  our  current  cash  position  of  over  $3  billion,  our  financial 
stability has improved the job security of all of the members of our 
team.  Our  merger  has  also  made  things  better  for  the  66  million 
passengers that flew with US Airways last year, to more than 250 
communities. Our larger, combined airline offers a bigger network, 
with more flights to more destinations. Consumers have also bene-
fited from our low-cost pricing philosophy, which brings lower fares 
to markets big and small, throughout our network. 

Some  examples  of  the  thousands  of  routes  where  we  have  re-
duced fares by up to 83 percent, include: Augusta, Georgia; Hunts-
ville,  Alabama;  Huntington,  West  Virginia;  Syracuse,  New  York; 
Wilmington,  North  Carolina;  Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania;  and  most 
recently,  Charlottesville,  Virginia.  In  fact,  we’ve  lowered  fares  to 
over 1,100 markets since our merger. 

I’m  also  proud  to  report  that  the  U.S.  taxpayer  has  benefited 
from  our  merger,  as  our  financial  success  allowed  us  to  repay  the 
America  West  and  US  Airways  loans  from  the  Federal  Govern-
ment.  The  loans  were  paid  early,  with  interest,  and  with  a  profit 
of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury. 

In short, the merger has been a tremendous success for everyone. 
And we are continuing to work hard to wrap up the few remaining 
steps necessary to get to a complete integration of the two carriers. 
But the success of that merger doesn’t mean we can stop striving 
to  improve  ourselves,  particularly  in  this  brutally  competitive  in-
dustry.  We  believe  we  have  an  opportunity  to  make  US  Airways  a 
better  and  more  efficient  competitor  through  our  proposed  merger

with  Delta.  We  believe  the  proposed  merger  would  be  good  for  all 
employees.  There  would  be  no  furloughs  of  front-line  employees  of 
US Airways or Delta, and we will raise every employee to the high-
est common labor cost. 

We  believe  the  proposed  merger  would  be  good  for  the  commu-
nities we serve. No domestic city with US Airways or Delta service 
today  will  be  without  service  after  the  merger,  and  no  hub  will  be 
eliminated. In addition, we believe the merger will be good for con-
sumers.  We  will  implement  our  customer-friendly  pricing  in  more 
markets to more destinations. 

Even  after  this  merger,  our  industry  will  still  be  highly  frag-
mented, and highly competitive. Low-cost carriers are committed to 
continued, aggressive expansion. This is an important time for our 
industry.  The  market  is  bringing  about  positive  change,  and  it 
should  be  allowed  to  continue.  I  would  encourage  Congress  to  let 
the  market  work,  so  long  as  any  transaction  is  compliant  with  the 
antitrust  laws.  My  fear  is  that,  if  we  do  not  do  that,  future  hear-
ings will not be on the opportunities facing our industry, but about 
the  overwhelming  challenges—and  ultimately,  the  need  for  addi-
tional industry bailouts. 

Mr. Chairman, Senator Stevens, other distinguished Members of 
the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  visit  with  you 
today, and I look forward to answering your questions at the appro-
priate time. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Parker follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF W. DOUGLAS PARKER, CHAIRMAN/CEO, 

US AIRWAYS GROUP 

Mr. Chairman, Senator Stevens, 
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the  issues 
confronting our industry. I am Doug Parker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
of US Airways Group. I have spent over twenty years in the airline industry, start-
ing with American Airlines, followed by Northwest Airlines, and then joining Amer-
ica  West  Airlines  in  1995  as  Senior  Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer.  I 
became  Chairman  and  CEO  of  US  Airways  after  the  September  2005  merger  of 
America West and US Airways. I am proud to be here representing the 35,000 em-
ployees  of  US  Airways  Group.  Every  day,  we  operate  almost  4,000  flights  to  nearly 
250  communities  in  the  United  States,  Caribbean  and  Europe.  Our  outstanding 
frontline  employees  are  represented  by  the  following  labor  unions—ALPA,  AFA, 
IAM, CWA/IBT, and the TWU. 

It has been 5 years since I last appeared before you. Today, I would like to speak 

to you about three issues— 

1. The State of the Industry Since I Last Spoke With You; 
2. The Successful Merger of America West and US Airways; and 
3. The Future Prospects for the Airline Industry. 

It was shortly after the tragic events of September 11, when I last addressed the 
Congress. The airline industry was in a precipitous financial tailspin when Members 
of this Committee and others in Congress stood with the industry by demonstrating 
leadership  and  conviction  in  enacting  legislation  to  provide  much  needed  liquidity 
to  our  industry.  The  measures  passed  by  Congress—direct  cash  transfers,  the  cre-
ation  of  a  loan  stabilization  board,  and  relief  on  war  risk  insurance  premiums, 
among other actions—enabled the industry to cover its basic operating expenses, in-
cluding  paying  employees  and  serving  communities  at  a  time  when  commercial 
loans and financing were unavailable at any cost. 

All of us in the industry were grateful for the help of the Nation. And we all knew 
that  the  industry,  like  America,  had  been  changed  forever.  But  none  of  us  could 
have foreseen the severity and duration of the crisis that faced airlines. Since 2001 
there have been: 

• 24 domestic Chapter 11 filings and 5 liquidations;

• $35 billion in cumulative losses; and 
• 154,000 airline industry employees laid off or terminated. 
The severe impact of multiple shocks to the aviation industry caused the industry 
to  repeatedly  come  back  to  Congress  for  help  on  a  regular  basis.  While  Congress 
did  help,  we  also  heard  the  message—and  appropriately  so—that  Federal  support 
should  be  the  exception,  and  not  the  rule—and  that  it  was  time,  as  an  industry, 
that  we  got  our  own  house  in  order.  At  America  West—now  US  Airways—we  took 
that message to heart. 

As a result, at America West, we re-doubled our efforts to lower costs and improve 
our  business  plan.  We  simplified  our  fare  structure  for  the  benefit  of  consumers  by 
lowering  many  of  our  everyday  walk-up  fares,  eliminating  Saturday-night  stay  re-
quirements  and  reducing  the  number  of  fare  categories  that  we  sold.  Not  only  did 
we simplify those areas where passengers interacted with the airline, we also inter-
nally  examined  all  our  business  processes  and  procedures.  By  eliminating  ineffi-
ciency and waste, we were able to further lower our costs. 

We  believed  if  we  aggressively  managed  our  costs  and  made  things  easier  and 
simpler  for  customers  they  would  respond,  and  we  would  return  to  profitability. 
Consumers responded favorably to our new policies and pricing, so much so that by 
2004, through the hard work of all of our employees, we had turned around our air-
line and returned it to profitability. 

As  we  returned  to  profitability,  we  sought  strategic  opportunities  to  strengthen 
our  company  for  the  longer  term.  In  2005,  we  were  presented  with  an  opportunity 
to  join  with  US  Airways,  a  leading  East  Coast  carrier  that  was  then  facing  great 
difficulty.  Through  its  two  bankruptcies  the  carrier  had  made  great  strides  in  low-
ering  its  overall  cost  structure,  but  given  the  inroads  made  by  low-cost  competitors 
in its core markets, it was unclear that US Airways would ever emerge from its sec-
ond  bankruptcy.  We  believed  that  a  merger  with  US  Airways  presented  an  oppor-
tunity  to  strengthen  our  own  company  and  provide  a  brighter  future  for  the  nearly 
35,000 employees of US Airways and America West. 

Many  experts  questioned  our  strategy.  We  had  named  our  merger  with  US  Air-
ways  ‘‘Project  Barbell.’’  One  industry  analyst  called  it  ‘‘Project  Dumbbell.’’  A  na-
tional newspaper featured a headline that proclaimed ‘‘America West Foolishly Bets 
the  Farm.’’  Yet,  despite  negative  press,  we  raised  over  $1.5  billion  in  equity  and 
partner  financing—the  most  ever  raised  by  a  U.S.  airline.  I  am  proud  to  say  that 
for  our  employees,  our  shareholders,  and  our  customers  that  ‘‘foolish  bet’’  has  paid 
off  handsomely.  Indeed,  we  posted  a  profit  for  the  first  three  quarters  of  2006,  and 
are  one  of  the  only  network  carriers  to  forecast  a  profit  for  the  fourth  quarter.  The 
front-line  employees  of  US  Airways  and  America  West  who  sacrificed  so  much  to 
turn  around  and  then  merge  our  companies  will  receive  2006  profit  sharing  pay-
ments in March. In fact, year-to-date through September 2006, our total accrual for 
profit sharing was $48 million. We fully anticipate that amount to increase after we 
report our fourth quarter results next week. 

Since  the  merger,  we  have  worked  to  instill  our  customer-focused  mantra  across 
our  larger,  combined  workforce.  We  have  continued  to  implement  popular  fare  re-
ductions  in  diverse  markets  such  as  Syracuse,  NY;  Washington,  D.C.;  Huntsville, 
AL;  Greensboro,  NC;  and  Augusta,  GA.  Most  recently,  we  have  lowered  fares  in 
Harrisburg,  PA.  In  total,  we  have  lowered  fares  by  as  much  as  83  percent  on  over 
1,100 markets. 

These fare reductions have proven beneficial to consumers and communities, par-
ticularly  so  in  smaller  communities  where  they  have  helped  small  airports  retain 
their local traffic base, and kept local travelers flying from their hometown airport, 
instead of driving to other airports. 

We  are  proud  to  have  brought  low  fares  to  communities  that  have  never  been 
served  by  an  airline  with  a  low-fare  mindset.  US  Airways,  however,  offers  more 
than  just  low  fares.  We  offer  service  to  234  destinations  in  the  United  States  and 
28 countries, including 19 European destinations with new service to Athens, Brus-
sels  and  Zurich  starting  this  summer.  We  also  offer  first-class  seating,  a  generous 
frequent-flier program and the ability to connect to cities all over the world through 
our various code sharing agreements. 

What we don’t offer is the old legacy airline mindset. After September 11, we rec-
ognized the structural changes that were necessary to survive. Our industry is con-
tinuing  to  evolve,  but  it  is  clear  that  the  days  of  high-fare,  high-cost  airlines  are 
gone,  and  that  low-cost  carriers  are  growing  and  thriving.  At  the  same  time,  the 
low-cost  carrier  business  model  of  point-to-point  flying  is  limited  and  cannot  serve 
all passengers, especially those who want to fly to international destinations or the 
smallest of communities. We believe our hybrid model, drawing upon the best of the 
traditional  airline  model  and  the  best  of  the  low-cost  model  is  the  right  plan  for 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

today and for tomorrow. For price sensitive passengers, we offer low fares. For other 
passengers who want enhanced frequent flier benefits or access to a global network 
of  destinations—we  offer  those  as  well.  In  a  deregulated  industry,  there  is  ample 
room  for  both  point-to-point  carriers  and  healthy  network  carriers  such  as  US  Air-
ways. 

Financially,  the  new  US  Airways  has  been  a  success.  Our  stock  appreciated  45 
percent in 2006, and we made over $400 million in profits (excluding special items) 
in the first 9 months of 2006. This has enabled us to lower our costs further by re-
structuring  our  debt  to  more  favorable  terms,  reducing  credit  card  holdbacks  and 
increasing  cash-flow.  As  I  mentioned,  we’ve  set  aside  approximately  $50  million  in 
profits, to date, to share with our outstanding frontline employees, not management. 
Finally,  one  other  significant  financial  accomplishment  was  the  complete  and  early 
repayment of both America West’s and US Airways’ ATSB loans ahead of schedule, 
with interest. 

Mr. Chairman, we are proud of our accomplishments, our employees, and our air-
line  in  successfully  navigating  the  challenging  years  since  2001.  Despite  naysayers 
and doubters at each and every critical juncture, we have remained loyal to our be-
liefs  that  if  we  managed  our  business  well  and  gave  customers  what  they  wanted, 
our version of a network carrier would be successful. 

While  we  believe  we  have  done  well,  we  know  we  can’t  rest  on  our  laurels.  We 
owe  it  to  our  shareholders  and  employees  to  constantly  look  for  ways  to  make  our 
company even more competitive in order to face the future and all that it may hold. 
With  that  in  mind,  we  decided  to  launch  a  public  offer  for  Delta  Air  Lines  on  No-
vember 15, 2006, after our private approaches were rebuffed. I would add that this 
transaction  is  different  than  the  norm,  as  Delta  is  in  bankruptcy.  In  this  situation, 
it  is  Delta’s  creditors,  not  management  or  shareholders  that  ultimately  are  respon-
sible for deciding Delta’s future. 

One  of  the  key  reasons  why  we  believe  Delta  is  an  attractive  merger  partner  is 
that  Delta’s  bankruptcy  provides  an  opportunity  for  Delta  to  restructure  and  lower 
its  costs.  US  Airways  successfully  did  this  in  its  bankruptcies,  and  its  lower  cost 
structure  is  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  success  of  the  America  West/US  Airways 
merger. We believe this success can be replicated and exceeded by a merger of Delta 
and  US  Airways.  Allow  me  to  highlight  some  key  metrics  and  commitments  of  our 
proposal: 

served by the new Delta after the merger; 

a promise we made and kept in the US Airways/America West merger; 

• $1.65 billion in projected annual cost savings and synergies; 
• No  furloughs  or  layoffs  of  frontline  employees  of  either  US  Airways  or  Delta, 
• All  domestic  airports  that  have  US  Airways  or  Delta  service  today  will  be 
• The new Delta also will be one of the most financially stable airlines in the in-
dustry. The company will be well-financed to meet its current and long-term ob-
ligations,  as  well  as  have  a  comfortable  cash  reserve  to  withstand  industry 
downturns; and 
• Finally,  the  new  Delta  will  have  a  management  team  that  understands  how  to 
integrate two large, complex airlines. We have been there before, and know we 
can do a great job with Delta. 

Some  critics  cynically  dismiss  this  merger  as  an  attempt  to  generate  a  windfall 
for US Airways’ shareholders and executives on the backs of the sacrifices made by 
Delta’s  employees  during  the  bankruptcy.  Such  criticism  misconstrues  the  philos-
ophy  that  guides  the  US  Airways’  management  team  and  Board  of  Directors.  Our 
management  team  is  not  made  up  of  financiers  and  other  ‘‘Wall  Street’’  types  who 
are  here  for  the  deal  and  then  move  on  to  some  other  transaction  with  no  regard 
for  the  employees.  Rather,  we  are  all  airline  people.  Most  members  of  the  senior 
management team have 10 years or more running airlines. Put simply, we love this 
industry. That is why we are trying to build a network airline that can compete suc-
cessfully  against  all  carriers:  low-cost,  traditional,  and  international  mega-carriers. 
In  order  to  do  that,  we  need  to  build  an  airline  that  is  strong  financially  and  able 
to withstand the next external shock or economic down-cycle that hits our industry: 
• For  consumers  this  means  their  favorite  flights  and  services  are  there  for  the 
• For  communities,  it  means  a  partner  and  corporate  citizen  that  also  is  in  the 
• For our employees, we want a company where their jobs and benefits are stable 
not just during the industry peaks, but also during the inevitable difficult times 
that are a fact of life in our industry. 

community for the long term, with service stability and certainty; and 

long term, as are their frequent flier miles;

Since this Committee last reviewed an airline merger some 6 years ago, a lot has 
changed  in  the  airline  industry.  Six  years  ago,  although  Southwest  had  a  national 
presence,  airlines  such  as  JetBlue,  AirTran  and  Frontier  were  scarcely  known  be-
yond  their  home  bases.  Since  the  industry  began  to  emerge  from  the  depths  of  the 
immediate  post-9/11  time  period,  it  is  low-cost  carriers  Southwest,  JetBlue  and 
AirTran  that  have  led  the  industry,  with  both  profits  and  growth.  A  few  examples 
of this growth include: 

• Since 2004, Southwest has started service in 4 major airline hub markets—Den-
ver,  Philadelphia  and  Pittsburgh  and  Washington  Dulles,  adding  126  new  de-
partures in these markets; 
• JetBlue added 16 new markets in 2006 and has already announced new service 
to San Francisco this year. In addition, JetBlue serves 23 markets from Boston, 
having only started service there in 2004; and 
• AirTran has grown both internally through the delivery of at least one airplane 
per  month  since  2005,  and  also  is  seeking  to  grow  through  an  acquisition  of 
Midwest Airlines. 

Passengers have responded. Six years ago, low-cost carriers accounted for a small 
fraction  of  the  market.  Today  these  carriers  account  for  approximately  30  percent 
of all domestic traffic and an even larger share along the Eastern Seaboard. As tra-
ditional  carriers  have  redeployed  aircraft  from  domestic  routes  to  international 
routes, new entrants have moved to take advantage of the opportunities created. In-
deed, these new entrant carriers are no longer afraid to compete head-to-head with 
traditional  carriers.  For  proof  of  these  carriers’  popularity  and  strength  one  need 
only look at Southwest’s entry into markets such as Baltimore-Detroit, Philadelphia- 
Columbus,  and  Denver-Chicago,  or  the  fact  that  JetBlue  offers  a  competing  shuttle 
service within the Northeast as an alternative to the Shuttle flights operated by US 
Airways and Delta. 

The  low-cost  carriers  are  continuing  to  grow.  Today  traditional  airlines  are  only 
now  looking  at  re-fleeting  their  mainline  operations,  with  deliveries  largely  pushed 
out  beyond  2010.  By  contrast,  new  entrant  carriers  have  placed  firm  orders  for  al-
most  335  aircraft  over  the  next  5  years.  These  new  entrants  and  low-cost  carriers 
provide  head-to-head  competition,  for  they  are  the  price  leaders  in  city  pairs  where 
they  compete  and  they  influence  pricing  in  nearby  markets.  Our  experience  has 
been that passengers will drive 60, 90 or even 120 minutes for a lower fare. Today, 
we  face  low-cost  carrier  pricing  from  airlines  such  as  Southwest,  JetBlue  and 
AirTran,  whose  combined  market  share  currently  approaches  one-third  of  the  do-
mestic  market.  After  the  merger,  81  percent  of  US  Airways/Delta  passengers  will 
have  low-cost  carrier  competition  at  their  local  airports.  An  additional  13  percent 
will have access to such service within 100 miles. 

We  fully  expect  that,  for  example,  by  lowering  fares  in  Harrisburg,  PA,  US  Air-
ways will recapture traffic that has been driving from Central Pennsylvania to Bal-
timore  for  lower  fares.  This  phenomenon  is  repeated  in  communities  big  and  small 
throughout the United States. The old US Airways would lose money on every ticket 
sold were it to have lowered fares in markets where it did not directly face low-cost 
competition,  in  places  such  as  Harrisburg,  PA,  Wilmington,  NC  or  Huntsville,  AL. 
In sharp contrast, the new US Airways has a cost structure that permits it to lower 
fares  and  remain  profitable,  and  indeed,  we  have  to  in  order  to  compete  with  the 
growing low-cost carriers. 

We believe that through our proposed merger we have the same potential to ben-
efit consumers that we did in the US Airways/America West merger. With the abil-
ity to lower costs, gain efficiencies and adjust flying to better align demand and ca-
pacity,  we  believe  we  can  lower  fares  in  dozens  of  new  markets  and  communities, 
just  as  we  are  doing  at  US  Airways  today.  Moreover,  passengers  will  benefit  from 
the  ability  to  get  to  more  destinations  via  more  routings;  it  is  far  more  likely  that 
thanks  to  the  new  Delta  more  passengers  will  be  able  to  get  to  their  destination 
at a time convenient for them and at a price that is reasonable, than would be pos-
sible under either stand-alone Delta or US Airways. 

Because  lots  of  misinformation  and  confusion  has  surrounded  our  bid  for  Delta, 

we want to provide you with the clear facts: 

1.  Every  U.S.  city  currently  served  by  either  airline  will  continue  to  have  serv-
ice from the new company. 
2. On the labor front, we have made several commitments to the employees and 
unions  of  US  Airways  and  Delta.  We  have  committed  to  moving  to  the  highest 
common  denominator  on  labor  costs  for  all  employee  groups.  We  have  com-
mitted  to  not  furlough  frontline  employees  of  either  US  Airways  or  Delta.  In-
stead, we plan to manage the mainline operational employee reductions through

attrition and other voluntary means, just as we did successfully in the US Air-
ways/America  West  merger.  We  have  committed  to  allowing  Delta’s  employees, 
the  vast  majority  of  whom  are  not  represented  by  a  union,  to  decide  for  them-
selves  the  question  of  union  representation,  and  to  do  so  without  management 
opposition.  And  we  have  committed  to  honoring  the  terms  of  all  labor  agree-
ments—including  the  Delta  pilot  agreement.  Finally,  and  importantly,  we  will 
not close any hubs in either the current Delta or US Airways’ networks. 
3. We expect that at the appropriate time the Department of Justice (DOJ) will 
fully  investigate  the  merger.  We  plan  to  work  cooperatively  with  DOJ  during 
the investigation and have begun to do so already. We spent a lot of time prior 
to making our bid for Delta considering the many potential antitrust issues, and 
we  believe  that  our  transaction  is  beneficial  for  consumers,  communities  and  a 
major step toward building a company that will provide stability for its employ-
ees over the long-term. 
4. This merger is in the best interest of consumers. Our synergies are not predi-
cated on raising fares. They are predicated on gaining efficiencies by cutting du-
plicative costs in locations served today by both US and Delta. If we were plan-
ning,  as  our  critics  claim,  to  gain  synergies  by  raising  fares,  that  plan  would 
fail  in  the  long  run,  because  low-cost  carriers  would  come  in  and  undercut  the 
higher fares. The industry is brutally competitive today and will remain so even 
after  this  merger.  Our  model  is  based  on  a  sustainable  plan  to  serve  markets 
at  a  lower  cost,  and  thereby  be  able  to  compete  with  low-cost  carriers  on  price. 
The decisions that we make will be decisions that we believe are in the best inter-
ests  of  the  employees  and  shareholders  of  the  new  Delta  and  the  consumers  and 
communities we will serve. But, they are by no means zero-sum decisions. New en-
trants  and  low-cost  carriers  have  hundreds  of  aircraft  deliveries  scheduled  for  the 
coming  months  and  years.  These  carriers  can  and  will  quickly  capitalize  on  new 
market or growth opportunities. Indeed, AirTran, JetBlue and Southwest have pub-
licly  expressed  interest  in  acquiring  divested  assets  as  a  result  of  the  merger.  In 
the  current  environment,  the  loss  of  a  carrier  in  a  market  or  a  drop  in  frequencies 
does not equal a permanent loss of competition. What drives airline expansion deci-
sions  is  demand,  and  demand  is  driven  by  continued  economic  growth  and  expan-
sion.  As  the  national  economy  continues  to  grow  and  regional  economies  grow  even 
faster, demand for air travel will continue to encourage new market entry by tradi-
tional and low-cost carriers alike, as well as by new start-up airlines with business 
plans that have not yet been born. 

Our  industry  stands  at  a  crossroads.  We  can  continue  down  the  current  path  of 
boom and bust uncertainty, or we can chart a new course. The question that legisla-
tors  and  policymakers  face  is  simple;  shall  we  embrace  change  to  better  serve  our 
customers, employees and communities, or are we content with a future of continued 
financial uncertainty and government bailouts? We believe—and our experience has 
proven—that we have to break with the failed policies of the past in order to provide 
a more sustainable future for all stakeholders. 

Whether or not our industry is on the cusp of a major consolidation period, I don’t 
know. What I do know is that our industry remains extremely fragmented with sub-
stantial  levels  of  excess  capacity.  After  the  merger,  and  the  announced  capacity  re-
ductions,  our  industry  will  remain  highly-competitive,  and  consumers  will  continue 
to  enjoy  high-service  levels  and  low  fares.  We  have  put  forth  a  fair  and  equitable 
proposal,  which  we  have  enhanced  to  make  even  more  compelling,  to  merge  with 
Delta while the carrier is still in bankruptcy, and to make the combination of Delta 
and  US  Airways  into  a  stronger,  more  competitive  carrier  than  either  carrier  can 
become  on  its  own.  Put  simply,  in  this  merger,  1+1  most  definitely  equals  3,  just 
as it did with our prior merger. 

While  being  a  good  corporate  citizen  is  important  to  US  Airways,  and  we  know 
to  Delta  as  well,  the  most  important  group  of  stakeholders  are  our  customers  and 
the  frontline  employees.  Delta’s  historical  reputation  for  customer  service  was  not 
developed in the boardroom or the executive offices. It is earned every day on every 
flight  by  one  of  the  most  dedicated  and  professional  workforces  in  the  industry.  I 
pledge  to  you  today  that  we  will  not  furlough  any  frontline  employees  of  Delta  or 
US  Airways  as  part  of  this  merger.  We  will  align  the  work  group  cost  structures 
between current US Airways and Delta employees, and going forward we will move 
to  the  higher  cost  scale.  In  fact,  the  day  after  the  merger  closes  Delta  employees 
won’t notice any changes—not even a change to the name of the airline. Over time, 
we will seek to take the best practices from either Delta or US Airways and stand-
ardize them across the new combined airline. Our ultimate goal is to build a strong-
er and more secure future for all of our stakeholders.

Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Stevens,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  visit  with  you 

today. I look forward to answering any questions the Committee might have. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Chairman? May I interrupt? 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Absolutely. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  note  that  a  quorum  is  present  such—may  I 
temporarily  recess  the  aviation  hearing,  and  return  to  Executive 
Session and adopt the Committee rules? 

[Recess of hearing 10:35 a.m.] 
[Hearing re-convened.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Our  next  witness  will  be  Mr.  Gerry 
Grinstein. And we’re very happy to have you here, sir, and we look 
forward to your testimony. 

STATEMENT OF GERALD GRINSTEIN, 

CHIEF EXCUTIVE OFFICER, DELTA AIRLINES 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. The technology has changed dramatically since I 

was here, too. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. Thank you. 
I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  my  views  about  the  im-
pact of consolidation on the airline industry, generally, and US Air-
ways hostile takeover attempt of Delta, specifically. 

In  case  there’s  any  question  of  the  hostile  nature  of  it,  take  a 
look behind me at all of the people from Delta who have come here 
today  to  let  you  know  by  their  presence  how  strongly  they  feel 
about this. 

Congress  is  right  to  carefully  examine  this  important  public  pol-
icy  issue,  because  the  decisions  made  now  will  effect  the  competi-
tive  landscape  for  years  to  come.  Your  decisions  on  consolidation, 
including any decisions made about the proposed US Airways/Delta 
merger,  will  impact  consumers  and  communities  across  the  coun-
try. If this deal is allowed to go forward, it most certainly will trig-
ger  broad  industry  consolidation,  and  the  likely  outcome  will  leave 
US  Airways/Delta,  the  weakest  of  the  carriers,  with  little  West 
Coast and Asia presence, and a staggering debt load of $24 billion. 
In  many  ways,  the  market  has  already  helped  restructure  the 
airline industry, so it is not clear to me that consolidation is inevi-
table. But, if consolidation does happen, it should happen in a way 
that  does  not  unfairly  penalize  employees,  does  not  harm  con-
sumers  and  communities,  and  provides  long-term  value  for  all 
stakeholders. 

To  ensure  this,  each  transaction  should  be  evaluated  on  its  own 
merits.  A  US  Airways/Delta  merger,  a  merger  that  is  even  more 
anti-competitive  than  the  proposed  United/US  Air  merger  rejected 
in  2001  by  the  Department  of  Justice  after  18  months  of  hearing, 
is  the  poster  child  of  the  worst  kind  of  merger,  and  on  its  merits, 
should be rejected. 

Of  course  we  take  seriously  our  fiduciary  duty  to  maximize  the 
value  of  our  company  for  our  creditors.  Some  of  our  work  in  this 
area has generated rumors and speculation. One such is that Delta 
is  negotiating  with  Northwest.  Let  me  be  very  clear  about  that— 
we are not negotiating any such deal with Northwest. 

Importantly,  the  US  Airways  deal  would  reverse  the  hard  work 
and remarkable progress Delta people have made restructuring our

airline.  In  just  16  short  months  since  filing  for  Chapter  11,  Delta 
is poised to emerge from bankruptcy this spring, as a strong, fierce-
ly competitive, and stand-alone airline. 

Using  the  bankruptcy  process  the  right  way,  Delta  people  have 
transformed our company’s business model, and will soon realize a 
healthy,  financially  viable  company  with  the  best  balance  sheet 
and  the  lowest  cost  structure  among  the  network  carriers.  We’ve 
reduced  our  debt  load  from  $17  billion  to  a  projected  $7.5  billion. 
We’ve  eliminated  $2  billion  in  annual  costs.  We’ve  generated  a 
sound  liquidity  position,  and  our  business  plan  calls  for  profit-
ability, and we will attain that. 

We’ve  right-sized  our  domestic  network,  adding  more  profitable 
international  markets.  Delta  provides  service  to  209  domestic  and 
95  foreign  destinations.  We  have  undertaken  the  largest  inter-
national  expansion  in  history.  We  are  now  the  number  one  U.S. 
carrier across the Atlantic. 

As a real testament to Delta people during this time of upheaval 
and  uncertainty,  the  company’s  operating  performance  and  cus-
tomer satisfaction scores have actually improved, earning Delta the 
number  two  spot,  barely  behind  the  number  one,  in  the  J.D.  Pow-
ers survey for 2006. As a result of Delta’s people’s efforts, our com-
pany  will  emerge  as  a  formidable  global  competitor  with  an  esti-
mated  consolidated  equity  value  of  between  $9.4  billion  and  $12 
billion—and,  as  I  noted  before,  one  of  the  strongest  balance  sheets 
in the industry. 

So, unlike US Airways’ situation before it was acquired by Amer-
ica  West,  Delta  does  not  need  to  be  acquired  to  be  saved—nothing 
could be further from the truth. It is clear that what Delta employ-
ees have worked and sacrificed together to realize is achievable and 
well in sight. This is the moment they deserve, and this is the mo-
ment  US  Airways’  merger  proposal  would  unfairly  and  unneces-
sarily  take  away  from  them.  Delta  people  deserve  to  determine 
their own destiny. 

With  me  today  is  Captain  Lee  Moak,  Chairman  of  the  Delta 
chapter  of  ALPA,  the  union  representing  6,500  pilots.  And,  by  the 
way, Delta has called all of the pilots off of its furlough list, so we 
are—now have grown to—everyone has been offered a position. We 
also  have  members  of  Delta’s  Board  Council,  the  group  rep-
resenting  nearly  40,000  Delta  employees,  and  Cathy  Cone,  Chair-
man  of  Delta’s  Retiree  Committee,  representing  more  than  36,000 
retired Delta people and their families. They are steadfastly united 
in  their  opposition  to  the  US  Airways  deal,  and  let  me  note  that 
ALPA and the retirees are two of the largest creditors of Delta. 

Among  the  many  issues  of  concern—justifiably  worried  about,  is 
the  estimated  10,000  jobs  that  will  likely  be  eliminated  due  to  the 
10  percent  capacity  reduction  US  Airways  has  said  will  take  place 
as a result of a merger with Delta. Each has a prepared statement 
for  the  Committee,  and  I  would  ask  that  those  be  included  in  the 
record, if that could be done. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. And they will be included. 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. Thank you. 
The US Airways/Delta merger also must be rejected and opposed 
because  it  is  blatantly  anti-competitive.  As  the  overlapping  route 
chart on the easel here graphically shows—and, by the way, that’s 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

23 

US Airways’ chart—Delta and US Airways compete extensively up 
and  down  the  Eastern  Seaboard,  and  in  routes  to  many  western 
states.  They  are,  in  fact,  our  largest  competitor,  and  I  believe  we 
are their largest. 

Our  hubs  are  natural  competitors,  due  to  their  geographic  prox-
imity.  We  jokingly  refer  to  them  as  the  ‘‘three  twins  and  the  tri-
plets.’’ My written submission has substantial analysis and data on 
that,  and  I  won’t  go  into  it  now  at  the  moment.  But,  this  merger 
will  create  a  near-monopoly  with  over  90  percent  passenger  share 
in  more  than  1,500  markets  affecting  over  8.5  million  passengers. 
And  there  are  nearly  4,000  city  markets  where  33  million  pas-
sengers will see a significant reduction in competitive choice. Small 
communities will certainly suffer. 

With less competition, fares will increase. Again, US Airways de-
nies  this,  but  one  only  has  to  look  at  the  track  record.  Since  its 
merger  with  America  West,  for  every  market  where  US  Airways 
has  lowered  fares,  the  average  fares  increased  in  four  times  as 
many markets. Maybe that’s why tens of thousands of people from 
all 50 states and 105 countries have joined together in the rallying 
cry, ‘‘Keep Delta my Delta.’’ 

This  deal  is  bad  for  Delta  people,  bad  for  the  traveling  public, 
and  bad  for  small  communities.  And  this  hostile  takeover  is  noth-
ing  more  than  a  company’s  ill-conceived  plan  to  eliminate  its  prin-
cipal competitor, and it should be rejected. 

Thank you very much, I’m sorry I went over the time. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Don’t be. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Grinstein follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GERALD GRINSTEIN, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DELTA AIR LINES 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Commerce  Committee,  we  appreciate  the  op-
portunity to testify today about the potential impact of airline mergers and consoli-
dation.  Obviously,  the  immediate  issue  of  the  US  Airways  hostile  takeover  attempt 
is  of  serious  concern  to  Delta  and  104,000  active  and  retired  Delta  people—all  of 
whom  have  participated  in  this  company’s  remarkable  financial  turnaround  and 
care  deeply  about  its  future.  Clearly,  if  this  transaction  occurs,  the  impact  on  the 
industry  will  extend  well  beyond  our  airline.  We  are  grateful  to  the  Committee  for 
its vigilance and willingness to examine this proposed take over more closely. 

A  primary  reason  for  Congress  to  examine  the  competitive  impact  of  this  deal  is 
that  it  will  trigger  broad  industry  consolidation.  Almost  every  day  brings  a  new 
media report on potential mergers in the airline industry, most of which are stated 
openly as direct reactions to US Airways’ bid. And if this anti-competitive proposed 
merger  gains  approval  despite  its  substantial  adverse  impacts  on  competition,  con-
sumers, communities, and employees, virtually any other airline merger would like-
ly pass regulatory muster. In our view, the likely outcome of follow-on consolidation 
would be to leave the combined Delta and US Airways as the weakest carrier, with 
little West Coast and Asian presence and a staggering debt load. 

We  believe  US  Airways’  unsolicited  and  anticompetitive  proposal  does  not  meet 
antitrust  standards,  and  would  harm  employees,  consumers  and  communities.  It 
would  create  a  much  weaker  combined  carrier  that  would  threaten  the  future  sta-
bility  of  our  Nation’s  air  transportation  industry.  It  would  reverse  the  remarkable 
progress Delta has made. Let me be clear—this is a hostile takeover bid; not a con-
sensual merger. 
1. Delta Is Poised to Emerge From Bankruptcy as a Strong Airline 

Delta  has  made  enormous  progress  over  the  past  16  months  in  transforming  the 
airline  into  a  strong,  healthy,  and  vibrant  competitor.  In  September  2005,  faced 
with  unrelenting  competitive  and  economic  pressures  and  a  staggering  $17  billion 
debt  load,  Delta  filed  for  Chapter  11  protection.  While  many  companies  use  the 
bankruptcy  process  simply  to  shore  up  their  balance  sheet  and  reduce  debt,  our 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

24 

company undertook a top-to-bottom re-engineering that touched every aspect of how 
we do business. We are using the bankruptcy process appropriately: to improve and 
strengthen our airline. 

As they have throughout this company’s 76-year history, Delta people stepped up 
to  these  challenges.  In  every  area  of  our  airline,  at  every  level,  they  participated 
fully  in  the  long,  demanding  restructuring  process.  The  result  has  been  a  remark-
able turnaround with accomplishments that include: 

• Reduced costs and improved unit revenue, positioning the airline to emerge from 
Chapter  11  with  the  lowest  unit  costs  of  any  network  carrier.  Delta  has  im-
proved productivity and eliminated approximately $2 billion in annual costs. 

• A  stronger,  more  balanced  network  as  a  result  of  rapid  expansion  of  inter-
national routes with the highest profit potential. In the past year Delta has un-
dertaken  the  largest  international  expansion  in  its  history,  and  we  are  now  #1 
in the transatlantic market. 

• Significantly  reduced  net  debt  from  $17  billion  to  an  anticipated  $7.5  billion  by 

the end of 2007. 

• Improved  liquidity  position  and  profitability,  totaling  $2.7  billion  in  cash,  cash 
equivalents  and  short-term  investments  as  of  November  30,  2006.  Delta  will 
emerge with the strongest balance sheet among network airlines. 

• An  expected  consolidated  equity  value  on  exiting  Chapter  11  estimated  between 
$9.4  billion  and  $12  billion—compared  to  essentially  zero  equity  value  only  16 
months  ago.  US  Airways’  unsolicited  offer  clearly  recognizes  the  value  Delta 
people have helped create. 

Importantly,  customer  service  standards  and  operational  performance  were  not 
sacrificed to achieve these gains. Passenger ratings instead increased, with the pres-
tigious  J.D.  Power  and  Associates  customer  satisfaction  survey  for  2006  ranking 
Delta as one of the top two domestic network airlines. 

Last month, Delta filed its Plan of Reorganization with the bankruptcy court. We 
are  now  poised  to  exit  bankruptcy  this  spring  as  one  of  the  best  positioned  airlines 
in  the  country  based  on  financial  strength,  profit  potential,  and  a  cost  structure 
among  the  lowest  of  any  traditional  network  carrier.  Our  global  network  provides 
access to more than 300 U.S. destinations and 52 foreign countries. The stage is set 
for Delta to emerge as a powerful, competitive force to be reckoned with—unless US 
Airways’  takeover  bid  is  allowed  to  derail  our  momentum  and  jeopardize  our  hard- 
won gains. 

Given  Delta’s  restored  financial  and  competitive  strength,  this  deal  is  not  at  all 
comparable  to  America  West’s  acquisition  of  US  Airways  out  of  bankruptcy.  That 
purchase  was  a  rescue  mission  of  a  failing  carrier  that  was  struggling  to  avoid  liq-
uidation. 

Compared  to  our  stand-alone  plan  for  reorganization  then,  the  US  Airways  bid 
produces  inferior  value  for  Delta’s  stakeholders.  US  Airways’  offer  is  structurally 
flawed  and  raises  overwhelming  regulatory  and  labor  issues  that  would  weaken 
Delta  going  forward.  Among  the  many  examples  is  fleet  efficiency.  Before  filing  for 
bankruptcy,  Delta  had  14  fleet  types.  Today,  we  have  eight,  all  manufactured  by 
Boeing (Exhibit A). 

Although US Airways recently raised its bid, which Delta’s Board plans to review 
shortly, management’s preliminary reaction is that the revised proposal does not ad-
dress the serious flaws our analysis identified in the original bid. 

So, Delta remains focused on emerging from Chapter 11 this spring. A successful 
emergence requires a complex and highly coordinated series of events and resources. 
Timing  is  crucial,  especially  since  many  essential  elements  such  as  financing  ar-
rangements are outside Delta’s control. If US Airways’ proposal is not stopped now, 
the  regulatory  and  bankruptcy  review  process  could  take  as  much  as  a  year,  even 
if  it  is  rejected  eventually  based  on  antitrust  and  anticompetitive  grounds.  Leaving 
Delta in bankruptcy limbo creates risks for all stakeholders, including creditors, cus-
tomers, employees, and vendors—a situation that is simply unnecessary. 

Of course, we take seriously our fiduciary duty to maximize the value of our com-
pany  for  our  creditors.  Some  of  our  work  in  this  area  has  generated  rumors  and 
speculation.  One  such  rumor  is  that  Delta  is  negotiating  a  merger  or  similar  deal 
with Northwest. One point we want to make very clear: We are not negotiating any 
such deal with Northwest. However, in the face of US Airways’ hostile takeover bid, 
our  Official  Creditors  Committee  asked  us  to  help  gather  information  about  poten-
tial strategic alternatives from other airlines, including Northwest. To that end, we 
recently  retained  an  investment  banker  to  obtain  that  information,  a  far  cry  from 
negotiating for a merger. We are compiling this information, but there has not been

25 

any negotiation regarding a merger or similar deal with Northwest or any other air-
line. 
2. Delta People Deserve To Determine Their Own Destiny 

When  Delta  entered  Chapter  11,  the  people  of  this  airline  came  together  and  de-
termined  to  do  whatever  was  necessary  to  save  their  company.  They  worked  hard, 
long  hours  through  months  that  included  first  terrible  hurricanes  in  Florida  and 
then  the  devastation  of  Katrina.  For  many  at  Delta,  those  crises  affected  not  only 
their  jobs,  but  also  their  families,  homes  and  friends.  They  implemented  the  trans-
formation of our airline, from restructuring hubs to the largest international expan-
sion  in  our  history.  They  watched  as  co-workers  and  friends  left  as  part  of  regret-
table  but  necessary  job  reductions.  When  the  cleaning  of  aircraft  interiors  didn’t 
meet  their  standards,  they  volunteered  their  own  time  on  overnight  shifts  where 
people from throughout the company showed up to scrape gum off seat bottoms and 
sweep  the  jetways.  They  sacrificed  financially,  too,  from  pay  cuts  to  reductions  in 
benefits,  from  health  insurance  to  vacation  time,  to  the  loss  of  any  equity  value 
their years with Delta had earned them. 

They  tirelessly  developed,  implemented,  and  refined  the  changes  required  to  re-
build  the  airline’s  financial  position,  brand,  and  customer  service—believing  all  the 
while  they  were  restoring  not  only  Delta’s  future,  but  their  own.  And  by  all  rights, 
it should be. The exit from bankruptcy our company is poised to make is what Delta 
employees have worked and sacrificed together to achieve. This is the moment they 
deserve.  And  this  is  the  moment  US  Airways’  merger  proposal  would  unfairly  take 
away  from  them.  From  the  lost  opportunity  to  share  in  the  benefits  of  the  equity 
value  their  blood,  sweat  and  tears  have  created  to  the  likely  loss  of  an  estimated 
10,000 Delta jobs, Delta people are understandably and deeply concerned. 

As  soon  as  US  Airways’  hostile  takeover  bid  was  made  public,  Delta  employees 
and  retirees  erupted  in  an  overwhelming  grassroots  demonstration  of  opposition  to 
the proposed merger, followed by an outpouring of support for Delta’s plan of reorga-
nization. The Delta Board Council, a group representing Delta employees in various 
workgroups, quickly produced tens of thousands of buttons, wristbands and T-shirts 
bearing  a  ‘‘Keep  Delta  My  Delta’’  message.  The  result  has  been  a  nationwide  cam-
paign  with  a  website  that  has  so  far  collected  over  100,000  signatures  on  petitions 
opposing  the  proposed  merger,  and  generated  more  than  155,000  letters  to  Capitol 
Hill. 

The  Delta  unit  of  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association,  which  represents  our  airline’s 
pilots,  also  has  voiced  its  strenuous  opposition.  They  have  stated  clearly  and  pub-
licly  that  the  foundation  of  the  US  Airways  proposal—including  the  10  percent  ca-
pacity reduction and related job losses—cannot be accomplished consistent with the 
requirements of the Delta-ALPA collective bargaining agreement. Delta pilot leader-
ship  has  openly  stated  its  commitment  to  do  everything  possible  to  stop  this  deal, 
allocating $15 million toward that effort. 

Delta  people  are  united  in  their  strong  opposition  to  US  Airways’  proposal,  rep-
resenting  as  it  does  the  worst  possible  combination  with  the  most  negative  impact 
on virtually all constituencies. 
3.  US  Airways’  Proposal  Fails  Absolutely  To  Meet  Antitrust  Standards  and 

Would Reduce Competition and Harm Consumers 

US  Airways’  principle  goal  in  its  hostile  takeover  attempt  is  to  eliminate  its  key 
competitor. Delta is the airline with which US Airways’ network overlaps most, with 
the  highest  number  of  overlapping  markets  and  hubs.  No  merger  in  the  history  of 
this  industry  has  ever  been  approved  by  the  Department  of  Justice  with  anywhere 
near  this  degree  of  network  redundancy.  That’s  why  US  Airways  believes  this  will 
create cost synergies. This merger is being proposed to cut service, shrink hubs and 
increase prices. 

US  Airways’  proposal  to  merge  with  Delta  will  harm  competition.  In  a  pro-com-
petitive  merger,  the  two  airlines’  routes  do  not  overlap  excessively;  they  are  com-
plementary.  Joining  complementary  networks  can  enhance  competition  and  create 
consumer  benefits  that  result  in  lower  prices  and  increased  service  options.  Such 
mergers  can  provide  benefits  to  consumers,  communities  and  employees,  as  well  as 
creditors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. 

By contrast, US Airways’ proposed takeover of Delta is the poster child of an anti-
competitive  merger.  Delta  and  US  Airways  are  each  other’s  most  direct  and  perva-
sive  competitors.  The  combined  networks  almost  totally  overlap.  If  a  picture  is 
worth  a  thousand  words,  the  full  story  is  shown  in  the  map  marked  (Exhibit  B). 
The  Delta/Western  merger  in  1987  illustrates  a  pro-competitive  merger,  com-
bining  two  complementary  networks  with  very  few  overlaps.  Delta’s  network 
strength  in  the  South  and  East,  joined  with  Western’s  network  strength  in  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

26 

West, did not reduce competition. Instead, an expanded network of services provided 
a  platform  for  growth  and  significant  additional  value  for  customers,  communities 
and stockholders. 

The  America  West/US  Airways  merger  in  2005  arguably  could  be  considered  an-
other  example  of  a  complementary  merger.  Combining  the  two  geographically  dis-
tinct  route  systems  added  network  strength  and  scope  without  reducing  competi-
tion—an important distinction. 

Mr.  Chairman,  time  will  tell  whether  the  US  Airways/America  West  merger  will 
be  successful  or  not;  it  is  not  yet  complete.  US  Airways  has  made  numerous  prom-
ises and commitments on jobs, fares, and services, based on their experience in the 
America  West/US  Airways  combination.  But  one  thing  is  clear:  in  terms  of  size, 
scope,  overlap  and  competitive  redundancy,  it  is  totally  absurd  to  compare  that 
merger to the proposed merger between Delta and US Airways. 
Impact on Consumers and Communities 

US Airways and Delta compete directly in thousands of markets up and down the 
Eastern Seaboard and in many transcontinental markets from western states, to the 
East,  South  and  Southeast.  That’s  because  all  of  our  hubs  are  in  close  geographic 
proximity to US Airways’ hubs, as illustrated in (Exhibit C). 

• Delta’s Atlanta hub competes against US Airways’ nearby Charlotte hub. 
• Delta’s Cincinnati hub competes against US Airways’ Pittsburgh hub. 
• Delta’s JFK hub competes against US Airways’ Philadelphia hub. 
• Delta’s Salt Lake City hub competes against US Airways’ hubs at Phoenix and 

Las Vegas. 

Each of these hubs draws traffic from smaller cities, gathering enough passengers 
to  make  connecting  service  to  other  smaller  markets—or  to  other  big  markets  or 
even  international  destinations—sufficiently  profitable  to  continue  operating.  For 
example,  a  customer  traveling  today  between  Tallahassee,  Florida  and  Boston  can 
choose a connection through Atlanta on Delta or through Charlotte on US Airways. 
If  a  merger  were  to  occur,  the  merged  carrier  would  significantly  down-size  service 
at  one  or  more  of  the  competing  hubs—with  Charlotte  almost  certainly  losing  out 
in this example. 

While US Airways has said no city would be dropped from the combined carrier’s 
network, they also have admitted that the claimed cost synergies of the deal require 
at  least  a  10  percent  cut  in  capacity.  While  we  believe  this  number  is  understated, 
even a 10 percent capacity reduction requires elimination of flights and jobs equiva-
lent  to  about  200  airplanes.  Where  would  those  cuts  occur?  At  hubs,  most  likely 
leaving  only  one  of  the  current  two  or  three  operating  as  a  major  hub,  and  in  com-
munities served by those hubs. 

Cuts in competition are expected to: 
• Create  a  near  monopoly—more  than  90  percent  passenger  share—in  more  that 

1,500 markets affecting 8.5 million passengers annually. 

• Reduce  competition  on  31  overlapping  nonstop  markets,  impacting  more  than

ing approximately 33 million customers each year. 

US  Airways  contends  that  concerns  about  increased  fares  and  service  reductions 
are  unfounded.  Their  rationale  is  that  so-called  low-cost  carriers,  or  LCCs,  such  as 
Southwest  or  AirTran  and  other  airlines  will  fill  any  service  or  competition  gaps 
their proposed merger might create—a speculative claim at best. 

The primary loss of competition and service will be in the city pairs currently con-
nected  by  one-stop  service  operating  over  the  two  airlines’  competing,  overlapping 
hubs,  as  noted  earlier.  But  LCCs  are  highly  unlikely  to  replace  the  loss  of  a  com-
peting  hub  at  Charlotte,  Pittsburgh,  Cincinnati,  or  Salt  Lake  City,  for  two  primary 
reasons. 

First, unlike traditional network carriers such as Delta and US Airways, the LCC 
business  model  is  different  from  the  hub-and-spoke  system  of  gathering  travelers 
from  small  markets  into  hubs  where  they  connect  to  their  destination.  Instead, 
these  carriers  have  typically  cherry-picked  markets  with  enough  passengers  to  fly 
non-stop,  without  connecting  through  a  hub.  Since  2000,  they  have  expanded  pri-
marily into larger markets with over 7 million annual passengers. 

Second,  the  rapid  LCC  expansion  of  recent  years  has  slowed  considerably  in  the 
face of an airline industry which, in order to survive, has become far more efficient 
and competitive. As recent reports from JetBlue, AirTran, and others indicate, prof-

its are slowing—and along with them, so are orders for the new jets required to fuel 
their previous level of growth. 

After American acquired TWA in 2001, TWA’s major hub at St. Louis, which com-
peted  directly  with  American’s  hubs  at  Chicago-O’Hare  and  Dallas-Ft.  Worth,  was 
closed. In the interim years, even during the period when LCCs still were expanding 
rapidly, no carrier has stepped in to replace the lost hub service. 
Small  Communities  Will  Suffer  Significant  Loss  of  Service  and  Economic  Benefits 
The  major  loser  in  this  proposed  takeover  is  small  communities. 1 US  Airways’ 
plan  is  to  cut  capacity  in  connecting  markets  to  achieve  cost  efficiencies.  This  will 
be  devastating  to  dozens  of  small  cities  because  both  Delta’s  and  US  Airways’  net-
works  serve  a  greater  portion  of  these  markets  than  the  other  legacy  or  network 
carrier. For example, Delta serves 144 small cities. 

These two carriers are often the only competitors in these markets, so competition 
will suffer and consumers will have fewer choices as a result. For example, the com-
bined carrier would operate: 

• More  than  90  percent  of  all  service  at  Greenbrier/Lewisburg,  Huntington/Ash-

percent control in 10 markets served from those cities; and 

• More  than  90  percent  of  flights  at  Florence  and  Hilton  Head  and  60  percent 
to  70  percent  at  Myrtle  Beach,  Charleston,  Colombia;  and  Greensville/ 
Spartanburg—including more than a 90 percent monopoly in 30 to 40 markets. 
A  merger  between  Delta  and  US  Airways  would  make  the  combined  carrier  the 
largest  in  127  small  markets,  as  defined  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration 
(Exhibit D). 

Once again, US Airways’ claim that LCCs will fill the void belie the facts. Of the 
127  small  cities  where  a  combined  US  Airways/Delta  carrier  would  dominate,  only 
14 currently are served by LCCs (Exhibit E). Business travelers typically weigh the 
price differential between their time and higher fares and decide not to drive to air-
ports where LCCs operate when local service is offered. 
Fares Are Unlikely to Fall as Competition Is Reduced 

land, and Charleston, West Virginia; 

• 60  percent  of  all  seats  at  Portland  and  Bangor,  Maine,  including  more  than  90 

US  Airways  also  has  said  that  as  a  ‘‘price  maverick’’  and  a  ‘‘price  leader,’’  con-
sumers should not be concerned that it would increase fares even if the merger were 
allowed, despite a new-found domination in thousands of markets. The carrier actu-
ally  claims  to  have  reduced  fares  since  the  US  Airways/America  West  merger  in 
2005. 

The  facts  paint  a  different  picture.  US  Airways  is  a  price  leader,  but  in  an  up-
ward, not downward direction. In reality, the airline has increased the average price 
paid  by  consumers  in  four  times  as  many  markets  as  it  has  decreased  them.  US 
Airways  claims  that  it  has  reduced  fares  in  1,000  cities,  but  there  are  nearly  6,600 
cities  where  consumers  are  paying  higher  fares  than  they  were  before  US  Airways 
merger  with  America  West  (Exhibit  F).  These  increases  were  attained  through  a 
combination of actual fare increases as well as restrictions placed on the availability 
of  lower  fares.  Again,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  the  America  West  merger, 
unlike  the  proposed  US  Airways/Delta  merger,  was  not  about  eliminating  your  pri-
mary competitor. 

Also,  US  Airways  has  given  few  specifics  about  how  it  might  reduce  capacity  by 
10  percent  while  maintaining,  much  less  increasing,  current  revenues—unless,  of 
course,  the  combined  carrier  raises  fares.  All  indications—and  all  past  evidence— 
point to price increases for consumers should this merger go forward. 
4.  US  Airways’  Proposed  Takeover  of  Delta  Would  Have  Major  Adverse 
Impact  on  Washington-Reagan  National  and  New  York’s  LaGuardia 
Airports 

The potential anticompetitive impact of US Airways’ takeover attempt also would 
extend  to  Washington  National  and  New  York-LaGuardia  airports.  The  combined 
carrier would overwhelming dominate at these unique airports with restricted entry 
due  to  slot  controls  imposed  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  and  limited 
gates (Exhibit G). For example: 

• At Washington National, a merged US Airways/Delta would operate nearly four 
times  more  slots  as  its  next  largest  competitor,  even  after  divesting  one  of  the

Shuttles.  Contrary  to  US  Airways  claims,  divestiture  of  one  of  the  Shuttles 
won’t solve the problem. 

• At  New  York-LaGuardia,  the  combined  carrier  would  operate  almost  twice  as 
many  slots  as  the  next  largest  competitor,  even  after  divestiture  of  one  of  the 
Shuttles. 

• The  two  carriers  also  would  control  38  percent  of  the  gates  at  LaGuardia  and 

46 percent of the gates at Reagan Washington National. 

• Delta and US Airways are currently the only carriers with enough slots to serve 
small  communities  from  LaGuardia  and  Washington  National.  Those  services 
would be reduced, if not eliminated entirely, should US Airways’ proposal be al-
lowed  to  occur  because  additional  slots  and  gates  would  have  to  be  divested  to 
meet  DOJ  approval  (if  it  could  be  met  at  all),  and  the  new  carriers  would  not 
be able to serve those small communities with their smaller portfolios of divesti-
ture obtained slots at those airports (Exhibit H). 

5. The Proposed Merger Would Make Delta a Weaker and Less Competitive 

Carrier 

Despite  Delta’s  massive  restructuring  and  incredible  progress  since  September 
2005,  our  airline  will  end  up  as  a  weaker,  less  competitive  company  if  US  Airways 
is allowed to proceed with its take-over. 

The combined company would have a staggering debt burden of $24 billion—even 
higher than Delta’s debt when it entered Chapter 11—and far higher than the $7.5 
billion  projected  for  an  independent,  stand-alone  Delta,  following  our  exit  from 
bankruptcy  this  spring.  The  size  of  debt  does  matter  in  the  airline  industry.  A 
mountainous  debt  load  like  that  proposed  by  US  Airways  would  place  the  merged 
US Airways/Delta one crisis away from financial collapse. 

The  combined  carrier  would  have  no  significant  presence  in  Asia  and  the  West 
Coast.  It  would  be  competing  against  carriers  with  far  more  extensive  global  net-
works.  It  would  be  the  weakest  and  least  efficient  of  the  major  carriers  when,  not 
if, follow-on mergers occurred. 

A combined carrier would face significant employee integration problems. US Air-
ways is far from completing the labor integration made necessary by its merger with 
America West. To add more then 45,000 Delta professionals to the mix, all of whom 
are  vehemently  opposed  to  this  merger,  is  a  recipe  for  disaster.  The  Delta  pilots 
have  publicly  stated  that  US  Airways’  plans  for  reducing  capacity  would  violate 
their  contract.  Dissatisfied  Delta  people  likely  will  see  their  hard-earned  gains  dis-
appear. The traveling public will likely see service and operational performance de-
clines. All of this will disrupt Delta people’s lives as well as the service received by 
the traveling public. 

Employee  integration  would  be  further  complicated  by  pension  issues.  Delta  and 
Delta  people  joined  together  to  minimize  cuts  to  their  health  programs,  and  also, 
with the help of Congress, to preserve the already-earned pension benefits of 91,000 
Delta  employees  and  retirees.  US  Airways,  on  the  other  hand,  turned  all  of  its  em-
ployees’ pension plans over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, 
with a liability of $4.8 billion. 

Yet  another  concern  in  a  service  industry  where  employee  engagement  is  crucial 
would be the pending reduction of an estimated 10,000 jobs, though US Airways de-
nies  that  such  job  reductions  would  occur.  In  reality,  the  number  of  employees  em-
ployed  by  US  Airways/America  West  at  the  time  of  the  merger  was  43,000—that 
number  has  fallen  by  8,000  to  the  current  figure  of  35,000.  The  simple  fact  is  that 
the  combined  US  Airways  and  Delta  will  not  be  able  to  sustain  as  many  jobs  as 
the two companies do now. Regardless of how the process is defined, eliminating 10 
percent capacity across the system, consolidating operations at airport facilities, and 
consolidating  administrative  and  management  staff  will  lead  to  significant  job  re-
ductions, despite US Airways’ assertions to the contrary. 
Summary 

The  central  question  for  this  Committee  to  consider  is  which  is  better  for  con-
sumers,  the  hundreds  of  communities  served  by  Delta,  and  the  employees  whose 
blood, sweat and tears have earned them the right to participate in Delta’s success, 
as well as Delta’s creditors and other stakeholders? 

• To have Delta emerge as a strong, stand-alone competitive force? 
• Or to allow US Airways to merge with Delta, by far its largest competitive rival, 
thus  reducing  competition  in  thousands  of  markets;  eliminating  service,  espe-
cially  to  smaller  communities;  eliminating  10,000  jobs;  and  creating  an  airline 
with a precariously high debt load?

And also ask, is this what the people of Delta Air Lines deserve for all their hard 

work? 

Clearly,  Delta  would  be  much  weaker  financially  and  competitively  if  this  take-
over  bid  were  to  succeed.  All  Delta  stakeholders  and  the  public  will  benefit  from  a 
stand alone, independent Delta. 

Again,  our  company  sincerely  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  submit  this  testi-
mony  to  the  Committee  and  we  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  might 
have.

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Grinstein, very much. 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. Thank you. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  And  now  we  call  on  Mr.  Robert  Roach, 
Jr.,  General  Vice  President  of  Transportation,  The  International 
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 

STATEMENT  OF  ROBERT  ROACH,  JR.,  GENERAL  VICE 
PRESIDENT  OF  TRANSPORTATION,  THE  INTERNATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS 
Mr.  ROACH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  for 
the  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  on  behalf  of  the  Machinists  Union 
throughout North America. 

My name is Robert Roach, Jr., I’m General Vice President of the 
International  Association  of  Machinists,  and  I’m  appearing  on  be-
half of the International President Robert Thomas Buffenbarger. 

The Machinist Union is the largest airline union in North Amer-
ica.  We  represent  more  than  100,000  airline  employees  working  in 
every classification, including flight attendants, ramp service work-
ers,  mechanics,  and  public  contact  employees.  And  I’ve  been  privi-
leged  to  come  before  this  Committee  on  two  previous  occasions 
since 9/11, and I thank you for the invitation this week. 

The history since 9/11, the last 6 years, have been the most tur-
bulent  years  in  airline  history,  with  bankruptcy  after  bankruptcy, 
and  employees  being  forced  to  take  pay  cuts,  benefits  reductions 
and have lost billions and billions of dollars worth of pensions that 
were promised to them. 

The  next  step  appears  to  be  consolidation.  However,  consolida-
tion  brings  with  it  very  difficult  tasks—merges,  hubs,  routes,  inte-

gration  of  aircraft,  a  maintenance  program,  you’re  fixing  competi-
tion, and consumer pricing are very few of the issues that must be 
resolved. 

The  most  important  issue  that  must  be  resolved  is  the  integra-
tion  of  the  workforce.  That’s  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  con-
fronting an airline merger. 

The  failed  US  Airways/United  merger  cost  United  Airlines  hun-
dreds  of  millions  of  dollars,  which  could  have  been  used  to  avoid 
bankruptcy,  as  they  assigned  over  500  management  personnel  to 
work on that particular merger. We had done a study on that par-
ticular  merger,  and  we  saw  that  they  did  not  have  a  plan  to  inte-
grate  the  maintenance  program,  integrate  the  employees,  and  we 
advised  them  of  such,  and  we  opposed  that  merger.  However,  we 
believe that had they not gone down that road for 18 months, that 
$500  million  would  have  been  in  the  coffers  of  United  Airlines, 
maybe our pensions would have been saved, and maybe they would 
not have gone into bankruptcy. 

Another  impact  on  the  airline  industry  was  the  American  Air-
lines/TWA merger, in which TWA employees were promised jobs at 
American  Airlines.  Subsequent  to  9/11,  the  overwhelming  majority 
of  those  employees  are  gone—on  furlough,  or  have  been  forced  to 
retire prematurely. Those employees now, the flight attendants, are 
losing  their  recall  rights,  the  flight  attendants  are  losing  their  re-
call rights, and will not have any other jobs in the airline industry, 
and again, the loss of pensions. 

The  US  Airways  proposed  merger  with  Delta  Air  Lines—I’ve 
been  asked  on  numerous  occasions,  Can  it  work?  Will  it  work?  Do 
you  support  it?  Don’t  you  support  it?  And  my  answer’s  been  very 
clear—it’s a very difficult job to merge an airline, and what has to 
happen,  you  have  to  look  at  the  people  involved,  the  management 
people  involved,  and  do  they  have  the  capability  to  merge  an  air-
line? 

I say that that question is still open. America West merged with 
US  Airways  in  2005.  We  have  yet  been  able  to  reach  a  transition 
agreement  with  US  Airways  management.  There  is  not  a  mainte-
nance  program  in  place  on  America  West  or  US  Airways.  We  be-
lieve  that  those  things  must  happen  first,  before  we  can  consider 
another merger, into another larger airline. 

If  we  take—if  US  Airways  or  Delta  Air  Lines  takes  their  eye  off 
the ball, then we could have a catastrophe within the airline indus-
try.  We  have  put  together  a  merger  team  of  economists,  profes-
sionals,  lawyers  and  employee  representatives,  and  we  are  pre-
pared to sit with US Airways, and Delta and any other airline and 
evaluate their proposal and see whether that proposal is sufficient. 
Today,  we  believe  we  are  close  to  an  agreement.  We  are  tens  of 
millions of dollars apart. It is disheartening to our members as we 
are  only  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  apart,  that  billions  are  being 
thrown  into  a  merger,  without  regard  to  resolving  those  particular 
issues.  So  again,  we  say  that  the  issue  remains  unresolved  in  our 
minds,  however,  with  an  agreement,  the  transition  from  America 
West  to  US  Airways,  or  vice  versa,  we  believe  that  the  possibility 
exists that we can work together to resolve those issues. 

Again, we don’t have sufficient information. We believe that that 
investigation  must  be  very  transparent.  We  must  understand  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

34 

business  plan,  we  must  understand  the  maintenance  program,  we 
must understand what happens to the employees in that particular 
transaction. And we have the people, and we’re prepared to do that 
in a confidential basis, with our professional people. 

We  must  remember,  that  in  the  last  5  years,  billions  of  dollars 
of  pensions  have  been  terminated.  The  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty 
Corporation is now $18.1 billion in deficit. Many of the airline peo-
ple that we represented would have lost their pensions, had we not 
been  able  to  transition  them  to  an  IAM  multi-employer  plan.  But 
others,  in  other  classifications,  working  at  these  airlines,  do  not 
have  any  pension  today.  And  any  time  we  think  about  a  merger, 
or  an  acquisition  of  an  airline,  that  must  be  taken  into  consider-
ation.  And  I  would  ask  the  Congress,  and  this  Committee,  to  take 
that  into  consideration  in  their  deliberations  of  any  merger  trans-
action. 

Again,  we  must  look  at  the  combined  indebtedness  of  the  car-
rier—and  again,  we  will  look  at  that  from  a  professional  stand-
point,  and  see,  and  look  at  the,  this  particular  map  that  was  up 
there—put  those  airlines  together,  and  we  have  the  people.  We’ve 
been  involved  in  every  major  transaction,  bankruptcy,  merger, 
since  deregulation.  We  have  the  people  in  place  that  can  help  and 
assist in that transaction. And if we find it is not going to be a suc-
cessful  venture  for  the  communities  that  these  airlines  represent, 
the people that we represent, and for the flying public, we will op-
pose it. But, at this point, we don’t have sufficient information. 

We must also remember, that oil prices—— 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Mr.  Roach,  are  you  approaching  the  con-

clusion? 

Mr. ROACH. I’m coming right to the conclusion, right now. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Mr. ROACH. I don’t know how you do that. 
We  must  remember,  that  oil  prices  were  once  $80  a  barrel.  It’s 
now down to close to $50. A well-known oil trader named T. Boone 
Pickens  says  we’ll  see  $100  before  we  see  $40.  We  will  evaluate 
that—as President Bush said last night—we have too much of a de-
pendency on foreign oil. So, we have a very significant situation we 
must  evaluate.  Again,  the  door  is  open,  however,  we  must  transi-
tion America West in US Airways, before we can transition US Air-
ways into Delta Air Lines. 

Thank you for allowing me to speak here, and we’re prepared to 

answer any questions that the Committee may have.

The  last  6  years  have  been  the  most  tumultuous  in  the  history  of  the  airline  in-
dustry. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 nearly destroyed the industry, so much so that 
Congress had to take action, providing grants and loans to ensure its survival. Sub-
sequently, the industry has experienced the loss of over one hundred thousand jobs. 
Airlines used the bankruptcy process to obtain onerous concessions from their work-
ers.  This  has  lead  to  the  outsourcing  of  jobs,  further  erosion  of  earnings,  and  the 
destruction  of  pension  plans.  Since  2001,  169,000  employees  have  lost  jobs  in  the 
industry  and  195,500  hard-working  employees  and  retirees  saw  their  nest  egg  de-
stroyed,  their  pensions  shattered.  This  has  devastated  the  morale  and  efficiency  of 
those  employees  left  working.  Now  that  the  reaction  to  9/11  is  behind  us  and  the 
last two airlines remaining in bankruptcy are expected to emerge in the near future, 
the stage is set for the next chapter in our saga—industry consolidation. 

The  merger  of  two  or  more  air  carriers  is  not  a  simple  process.  There  are  many 
aspects to be considered in an airline merger; the integration of routes, consolidation 
of  hubs,  blending  of  aircraft  and  effects  on  competition  and  consumer  pricing  are 
but some of the many intricacies of a merger. Perhaps the biggest challenge in any 
merger  is  the  integration  of  the  workforce  so  that  the  newly  merged  carrier’s  em-
ployees  can  work  most  efficiently  under  common  conditions.  Rumors  of  a  merger 
prompt  endless  speculations  from  industry  analysts,  insiders  and  casual  observers. 
Mergers, however, don’t fail or succeed on such speculation. Sound business and in-
tegration plans are essential if a merger is to be successful. 

Carelessly  proposing  a  merger  could  create  such  an  atmosphere  that  the  carriers 
involved  may  be  adversely  affected.  In  2000,  United  Airlines  assigned  hundreds  of 
management employees to coordinate its failed merger with US Airways. Instead of 
focusing  on  United’s  operations,  tremendous  resources  were  wasted  on  a  merger 
that  had  little  chance  of  success.  The  Machinists  objected  to  the  merger  because 
management  failed  to  plan  for  fair  integration  of  the  workforce,  the  meshing  of 
maintenance programs and to develop stable business projections. Had management 
at the time listened to the Machinists Union, it would have been quite evident that 
the proposed United-US Airways merger was DOA. More importantly, it would have 
saved  the  company  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  that  may  have  been  helpful  in 
preventing the subsequent bankruptcy of that airline. 

What  constitutes  a  successful  merger  is  debatable.  In  our  opinion,  a  merger 
should be judged on its impact on employees, communities and passengers. Employ-
ees  have  been  devastated  in  the  past  as  a  result  of  airline  mergers.  There  must  be 
a qualified management team with the requisite skills to facilitate a smooth integra-
tion of work groups from the different airlines. Otherwise, a merger could be disas-
trous. 

When American Airlines purchased TWA out of bankruptcy in 2001, commitments 
were  made  to  TWA  employees.  American’s  then  CEO  Donald  Carty  testified  before 
this  Committee  and  said,  ‘‘We  look  forward  to  adding  TWA’s  20,000  employees  to 
the  American  Airlines  family,’’  and  that  American  was  willing  to  make  ‘‘commit-
ments  to  the  20,000  TWA  employees  and  their  families  that  no  one  else  would 
make.’’ In spite of these assurances, the overwhelming majority of former TWA em-
ployees  are  no  longer  employed  by  American  Airlines.  Thousands  of  mechanics, 
ramp workers, customer service agents, flight attendants and pilots who were prom-
ised careers with American are no longer working in the industry. Additionally, fur-
loughed  former  TWA  flight  attendants  are  now  losing  their  recall  rights  for  jobs  at 
American. 

Communities also often suffer in mergers. American Airlines promised the city of 
St. Louis that it would maintain TWA’s hub operation at Lambert Field. That once 
bustling  hub  with  over  300  flights  per  day  has  now  been  reduced  to  less  than  100. 
When  considering  the  merger  of  two  airlines,  it  is  important  to  look  at  how  their 
management has handled past mergers. In 2005, US Airways merged with America 
West Airlines. As a result of post-2001 restructuring, employees at both airlines suf-
fered  tremendous  hardships.  Since  9/11,  US  Airways’  employees  have  been  forced 
to  endure  two  separate  bankruptcies  and  three  consecutive  reductions  in  their 
wages and benefits. 

US  Airways  has  not  yet  negotiated  a  transition  agreement  with  the  Machinists 
Union  that  would  merge  the  mechanic  and  related  workforces  of  the  two  airlines. 
The  failure  to  reach  an  agreement  means  the  maintenance  programs  at  America 
West and US Airways have yet to be integrated. Nor has the fleet service operation 
at  the  combined  carrier  been  integrated.  The  failure  to  merge  the  groups  has  re-
sulted in employees at the same airport doing the same job, but working under dif-
ferent  work  rules  and  receiving  dissimilar  wages  and  benefits.  In  our  opinion,  that 
is  a  very  inefficient  way  to  operate  an  airline,  especially  in  today’s  cost  conscious 
environment. This is clearly a recipe for turmoil.

In  the  midst  of  an  incomplete  merger,  US  Airways  has  now  made  a  $10  billion 
bid for Delta Air Lines. The financial sacrifices of US Airways’ employees are what 
put  the  airline  in  a  position  to  make  such  a  proposal.  The  employees’  issues  must 
be  addressed  at  the  bargaining  table  before  US  Airways  can  merge  with  any  other 
airlines. 

Proposed  mergers  must  further  be  scrutinized  to  ensure  that  employees’  hard 
earned  nest  eggs—their  pensions—are  preserved.  The  Machinists  Union  has  mem-
bers  at  US  Airways,  United  Airlines,  Aloha  Airlines,  British  Airways,  and  Air  Mi-
cronesia who still have a defined benefit pension plan, the multi-employer IAM Na-
tional  Pension  Plan.  Our  members  at  Northwest  Airlines  will  participate  in  the 
same  pension  plan  when  that  carrier  emerges  from  bankruptcy.  IAM-represented 
Continental  Airlines  flight  attendants  are  currently  voting  to  join  the  secure  IAM 
National  Pension  Plan.  Although  the  IAM  has  been  successful  in  negotiating  new 
pensions  for  our  members,  many  other  airline  employees  have  lost  the  advantages 
of  a  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  At  a  time  when  airline-sponsored  pension  plans 
have either been terminated or underfunded, preserving existing pension plans, and 
extending benefits to employees without pensions, is a priority for the IAM. 

We recommend that this Committee consider whether any merger could result in 
the  termination  of  pension  plans.  The  terminated  plans  would  become  the  burden 
of  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation,  which  currently  has  an  $18.1  billion 
deficit.  Ultimately,  many  of  the  workers  affected  by  pension  terminations  will  be-
come the responsibility of the Federal and State governments. 

The  Machinists  formed  a  Transportation  Merger  Team  to  protect  the  interests  of 
IAM  members  affected  by  airline  mergers.  Comprised  of  employee  representatives, 
attorneys,  economists  and  research  specialists,  our  team  is  prepared  for  any  poten-
tial  industry  consolidation.  We  are  also  prepared  to  evaluate  any  proposed  merger 
and  determine  whether  it  would  serve  the  interests  of  our  members,  an  airline’s 
most  important  asset,  and  the  interests  of  the  flying  public.  For  this  to  occur  we 
need a transparent process that allows for information sharing. This can be accom-
plished  while  respecting  the  airlines’  need  for  confidentiality.  Once  US  Airways  re-
solves its issues with integrating employees from its last merger, our team of profes-
sionals  is  prepared  to  work  with  US  Airways  and  any  potential  merger  partners  to 
evaluate future mergers. We know that when airlines are in trouble, the first people 
they  look  to  for  help  are  their  employees.  Let  airlines  demonstrate  beforehand  that 
the merger they are proposing will not have additional adverse effects on loyal em-
ployees. 

There  are  numerous  media  reports  of  alleged  merger  talks  between  a  number  of 
carriers.  United  is  rumored  to  be  talking  with  Continental,  Northwest  with  Delta, 
Continental  with  Northwest,  United  with  Delta.  A  very  significant  question  must 
be  asked  of  any  merger,  ‘‘What  happens  if  oil  goes  back  to  $80.00  a  barrel?  Can 
these  combined  entities,  with  enormously  increased  debt,  survive? ’’  T.  Boone  Pick-
ens, a well-known and successful oil trader, has publicly stated we will see $100.00 
per  barrel  before  we  see  $40.00  per  barrel.  Can  a  merged  carrier  survive  under 
those circumstances? 

Therefore,  we  will  look  at  any  proposed  merger  with  those  factors  in  mind.  We 
urge  this  Committee  to  utilize  similar  criteria  in  evaluating  whether  any  airline 
merger will be successful. 

Mergers have been a part of the airline industry since its inception; however, air-
line  consolidations  are  fraught  with  difficulties.  The  Machinists  Union  has  been  in-
volved  in  nearly  every  airline  merger  since  airline  deregulation.  We  are  prepared 
to protect the interests of all affected workers by working with airline management 
and the appropriate government bodies to avoid the pitfalls of previous mergers. To 
do so, we need: (1) proper information, (2) a transparent process, and (3) a manage-
ment  team  that  demonstrates  an  ability  to  work  with  its  employees.  Without  such 
a  process,  we  will  be  left  with  no  choice  but  to  openly  oppose  any  merger  that  we 
determine  to  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  working  people  and  their  families,  the 
flying  public,  and  the  airlines  themselves.  On  behalf  of  the  more  than  100,000  air-
line workers who are members of the IAM, I implore you to work with the Machin-
ists and other airline unions to ensure employees are not adversely affected by any 
airline mergers. 

We  are  aware  that  some  of  the  mergers  being  contemplated  would  have  included 
greater  foreign  investment  and  control  than  is  currently  allowed.  I  thank  Congress 
and  especially  this  Committee  for  its  work  to  stop  the  crusade  to  allow  greater  for-
eign  control  of  U.S.  airlines.  I  also  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to 
speak with you today. I am happy to answer any questions. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Roach, very much.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  MARK  N.  COOPER,  DIRECTOR  OF 
RESEARCH,  CONSUMER  FEDERATION  OF  AMERICA;  ON 
BEHALF  OF  CONSUMER  FEDERATION  OF  AMERICA  AND 
CONSUMERS UNION 
Dr.  COOPER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman, 
members of the Committee. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to 
appear  before  you  today  to  present  the  consumer  view  on  the  cur-
rent  state  of  the  airline  industry,  and  the  impact  of  some  pending 
mergers that are on the table, and being discussed. I will offer the 
views  of  the  Consumer  Federation  of  America,  and  Consumer’s 
Union. 

If mergers like the US Air hostile takeover of Delta are necessary 
to  save  the  airline  industry,  then  Congress  must  confront  the  fun-
damental  failure  of  the  unregulated  airline  market,  to  meet  con-
sumers’  needs,  and  protect  the  public  in  half  the  country.  If  these 
mergers  go  forward,  this  Nation  will  be  divided  between  major 
urban areas, primarily on the coast, where consumers have a num-
ber  of  choices,  and  a  modest  level  of  competition,  and  the  rest  of 
the  country,  where  small  cities  and  rural  areas  have  little—if 
any—service,  and  even  mid-sized  cities  are  the  captives  of  virtual 
monopolies in fortress hubs. 

The  so-called  low-cost  airlines  have  not  entered  those  markets, 
and  would  leave  half  the  country  unserved.  The  fiction  of  competi-
tion  as  the  primary  means  of  consumer  protection,  and  industrial 
organization,  will  have  to  be  abandoned,  if  these  mergers  between 
large legacy carriers go forward. 

Looking back at theories of low-cost entrance, economies of scale, 
and cost savings synergies, ignores fundamental changes that have 
taken place in the industry, and the current structural condition in 
the  industry.  In  the  past  several  years,  competition  from  low-cost 
entrants has not disciplined dozens of price increases. Low-cost en-
trants  have  not  entered  these  markets—they  cherry-pick  high-vol-
ume  routes.  Capacity  has  been  shed,  and  costs  have  been  slashed 
by  the  legacy  carriers.  So  the  claim  that  entry  by  low-cost  carriers 
would  discipline  prices,  and  protect  the  public,  has  lost  its  teeth. 
It  was  a  great  theory  before  the  last  half-decade.  It  doesn’t  work 
anymore. 

Once  this  facade  is  stripped  away,  one  cannot  ignore  the  likely 
and  obvious  impacts  of  these  mergers.  Reduced  service,  eliminate 
choice, and price increases. We have not opposed every merger that 
comes down the runway. Certainly not geographic extension merg-
ers,  like  US  Air/America  West.  But,  we  urge  you  to  send  a  strong 
message to the airlines and the antitrust authorities, that mergers 
which  move  thousands  of  routes  to  monopoly,  duopoly  or  triopoly 
status, are not acceptable. 

The  antitrust  authorities  do  not  have  responsibility  for  the  over-
all  structure  of  the  industry—you  do.  The  antitrust  officials  can 
only  attempt  to  promote  and  preserve  competition,  but  if  there  is 
not enough competition, there is not an awful lot they can do about 
it, especially when they are concerned about financial stability.

It  is  the  Congress  that  has  the  obligation  to  protect  the  large 
numbers  of  consumers,  who  will  not  be  protected  by  effective  com-
petition.  To  have  a  world-class  economy  in  the  21st  century,  we 
must  have  a  world-class  airline  sector,  that  serves  the  entire  con-
tinent—this vast continent. 

As  I  testified  on  September  20  before  the  Congress,  just  a  few 
short days after the horrible events of 9/11—air travel is infrastruc-
ture  in  the  21st  century.  These  mergers,  this  hearing,  are  a  wake- 
up call. We must have a public policy that balances the goals of ef-
ficiency,  and  financial  stability,  with  a  need  to  serve  the  public— 
all  of  the  public—and  protect  consumers—all  consumers—not  just 
half  the  consumers  who  will  be  lucky  enough  to  have  the  benefits 
of competition. 

I  commend  you  for  holding  this  hearing,  and  look  forward  to 
working with you on this very difficult and important set of issues. 
We’ve emerged from a very, very dark period in this industry, and 
it’s really time for public policy to make sure we get the airline sec-
tor that this Nation needs. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  MARK N.  COOPER,  DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, 
CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA;  ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER FEDERATION OF 
AMERICA AND CONSUMERS UNION 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, 
My name is Dr. Mark N. Cooper. I am Director of Research of the Consumer Fed-
eration  of  America.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  address  the  issue  of  mergers  in 
the  airline  industry.  I  appear  before  you  today  on  behalf  of  the  Consumer  Federa-
tion  of  America 1 and  Consumers  Union 2 to  express  our  deep  concern  about  the 
pending merger wave in the airline industry. 

In  June  2000  testimony  on  ‘‘The  Proposed  United  Airlines/US  Air  Merger’’  before 
the Senate Antitrust Committee, I opened my testimony with the following observa-
tion: 

There  are  some  mergers  to  which  policymakers  and  the  Department  of  Justice 
should just say ‘‘no!’’ This is one of them. This merger would reduce competition 
in an industry that already suffers from a general lack of competition. It would 
trigger  a  round  of  mergers  that  would  leave  consumers  with  fewer  and  fewer 
choices across the Nation. New airlines would find it harder and harder to enter 
these more concentrated, integrated markets that would result. 
There  was  a  time  when  airline  problems  were  largely  problems  for  business 
travelers,  but  that  has  changed.  The  rapid  growth  of  personal  income  over  the 
past  decade  has  made  air  travel  much  more  common  among  residential  con-
sumers,  in  spite  of  sharply  rising  ticket  prices.  As  a  result,  consumer  groups 
such  as  CFA  have  become  more  and  more  concerned  about  the  failures  of  the

airline  market—poor  service  and  the  abuse  of  market  power  in  a  highly  con-
centrated industry. 3 

In March of 2001, we were confronted with a merger wave; I expressed consumer 
concern  about  the  emerging  industry  structure  at  a  hearing  in  the  House  of  Rep-
resentatives as follows: 

With  two  mergers  pending  between  major  airlines  and  a  third  being  widely 
talked about, there can be no more uncertainty about the structure of the indus-
try. The airline industry is in the process of organizing itself into a private car-
tel. Two or three dominant firms will control the vast majority of traffic through 
monopoly airports in fortress regions embedded in national networks that rarely 
compete with one another. 4 

Exactly  6  months  later,  testifying  a  few  days  after  the  events  of  September  11, 
2001, I again urged the Congress not to forget the consumer in writing public policy 
to deal with the airline industry. 

In addition to ensuring a more secure air travel network, it is absolutely appro-
priate  for  Congress  to  require  fairer  competition,  better  service  and  more  effec-
tive  consumer  protection  in  exchange  for  assistance  to  commercial  operators. 
The airline industry was falling seriously short in these crucial areas before the 
attack. 5 

The  mergers  that  are  on  the  table  today,  such  as  the  Delta-US  AIR  merger  or 
those that are being contemplated trigger all of our concerns, and are actually worse 
from  the  competition  and  consumer  point  of  view  than  the  United/US  Air  merger 
that we opposed in 2000. 6 I again urge the Congress to keep the consumer interest 
front and center when it examines these mergers. 

We  have  not  opposed  every  airline  merger  that  comes  down  the  runway.  The  US 
Air-America  West  merger  was  generally  a  geographic  extension  merger  with  little 
overlap  in  route,  which  we  did  not  oppose,  although  it  has  had  some  anti-competi-
tive  effects.  However,  we  do  oppose  mergers  that  have  significant  anti-competitive 
effects and there can be little doubt that the mergers on the table will have severely 
anti-competitive 7 and  anti-consumer 8 effects.  The  industry  has  repeatedly  claimed

6 Justin  Bachman,  ‘‘Airline  Mergers:  Ready  for  Takeoff? ’’  BusinessWeek.com,  December  22, 
2006: Delta contends that such a behemoth would never pass regulatory muster and has assem-
bled  a  detailed  power  point  scenario  of  job  cuts,  reduced  flights,  hub  domination,  and  higher 
fares  that  would  make  almost  any  consumer  advocate  cringe.  Dave  Carpenter,  ‘‘Airline-Merger 
Talks:  How  Will  Fliers  Fare? ’’  Associated  Press,  December  14,  2006:  Despite  numerous  recent 
fare  increases,  however,  ticket  prices  are  still  too  low  for  airlines’  liking  as  they  scramble  to 
boost  profits  in  the  face  of  soaring  jet-fuel  prices.  The  industry’s  solution?  Reduce  the  number 
of available seats by gobbling each other up. A wave of U.S. airline mergers could mean higher 
prices for travelers as overlapping routes are eliminated, experts said Wednesday as discussions 
between  United  Airlines  and  Continental  Airlines  coincided  with  an  announcement  by  AirTran 
of  plans  to  buy  Midwest.  And  just  last  month  US  Airways  began  a  hostile  bid  for  Delta  Air 
Lines. W. Schoen, ‘‘Airline Mergers Won’t Help Passengers: Travelers Face Packed Planes, High-
er  Fares  as  Industry  Consolidates,’’  MSNBC,  December  14,  2006:  Though  it’s  far  from  certain 
that  any  of  these  deals  will  go  through,  such  mergers  would  likely  give  the  remaining  carriers 
more  clout  in  raising  fares,  according  to  Jerome  Chandler,  a  contributing  editor  to  Frequent 
Flyer  magazine.  ‘‘It’s  Economics  101,’’  he  said.  ‘‘If  you  have  fewer  players  in  the  industry,  you 
are going to have higher fares. It’s almost inevitable. Mergers are about what’s good for the air-
lines—not necessarily what’s good for consumers.’’ 

7 Jeff  Bailey,  ‘‘Big  Consolidated  Airline  Inc.:  A  Wave  of  Merger  Deals  May  Increase  Profits, 
Fares and the Crowding of Flights,’’ The New York Times, December 14, 2006, C–1: Mr. Leonard 
(Chief  Executive  of  AirTran)  may  relish  his  role  as  underdog  but  that  is  not  why  he  hopes  the 
carriers  (Delta  and  US  Airways)  merge—he  just  wants  to  see  fewer  jets  in  the  sky.  After  all, 
US  Airways’  proposed  takeover  would  reduce  the  two  airlines  combined  jet  fleet  about  10  per-
cent. That, in turn, would allow the merged Delta—and AirTran—to raise fares on many routes, 
significantly increasing profits. 

8 Brad  Foss,  ‘‘Airline  Mergers  Could  Raise  Fares  in  2007,’’  KiplingerForecasts.com:  Kevin 
Mitchell,  however,  said  ticket  prices  would  rise  significantly  and  the  public  can  expect  service 
disruptions, repercussions from labor strife and more job insecurity in the airline industry if the

that  anticompetitive  mergers  are  crucial  to  the  viability  of  the  industry,  but  that 
has not generally been the case. The effect over time is to leave the consumer with 
less competition and an industry that is no healthier. 

We  have  had  a  hiatus  in  consolidation  in  the  industry  in  the  past  half  decade, 
as  the  industry  restructured, 9 but  that  does  not  change  the  fundamental  concerns 
about  anti-consumer  and  anti-competitive  effects  of  mergers  in  this  industry.  The 
elimination  of  competition  and  the  reinforcement  of  dominant  fortress  hubs  inevi-
tably  raise  concerns  about  rising  prices.  Competitive  entry  in  the  industry,  to  the 
extent  it  can  discipline  the  abuse  of  market  power,  is  highly  restricted,  limited  to 
selective,  high  volume  routes  and  markets.  The  so-called  low-cost  airlines  would 
leave more than half the country unserved. 

As  travelers  fall  under  the  control  of  one  airline,  the  ability  of  new  entrants  to 
crack  markets  is  reduced.  It  becomes  harder  and  harder  to  attract  passengers  to 
flight  segments  and  the  necessary  scale  of  entry  gets  larger  and  larger.  The  incon-
venience, and in many cases, the impossibility of inter-airline travel, give the airline 
enhanced  market  power  over  the  traveler.  Travelers  thus  suffer  the  typical  effects 
of the abuse of market power—fewer choices, higher prices and lower quality. Low- 
cost  airlines  selectively  enter  the  high  volume  routes,  leaving  much  of  the  country 
with  little  competition.  The  past  history  of  mergers  suggests  that  consumers  will 
end up with higher prices, less service and the industry will remain in turmoil. 

The  fact  that  the  industry  goes  through  wild  boom  and  bust  cycles  is  not  a  jus-
tification  for  letting  down  our  guard  against  the  abuse  of  market  power.  At  a  min-
imum,  the  boom  and  bust  cycles  create  cycles  of  uneven  service;  at  a  maximum,  it 
strands  consumers.  Having  gone  through  a  series  of  bankruptcies  and  a  large  loan 
guarantee program to bail the industry out, we are faced with a massive consolida-
tion  and  Congress  must  ask  where  is  the  public  interest  in  all  this?  How  will  the 
consumer be served? 

Backward looking analyses based on pre-2000 industry behavior that claim the so-

rear  view  mirror,  such  analyses  ignore  the  fundamental  shifts  in  the  industry  that 
suggest  low-cost  entrants  simply  will  not  restrain  price  increases  on  the  many 
routes that lack sufficient competition today and would have competition further re-
duced by these mergers.

2006. Big carriers operate on the hub-and-spoke model and are looking to merge with a similar 
operation  to  complement  their  existing  routes.  Smaller  carriers  aren’t  appealing  because  they 
just don’t fly to enough places.

• The  so-called  legacy  carriers  have  substantially  modified  their  cost  structures, 

so the claim of bloat has lost its credibility. 14 

41 

Backward  looking  analyses  of  previous  mergers  do  not  lay  our  concerns  to  rest 

either, for two reasons: 

• First, the underlying motivations for past mergers differs from those being con-
templated today. The economic rationales offered had a more plausible basis to 
claim  they  would  be  consumer  friendly,  even  though  they  have  not  worked  out 
that way. 15 
• Second,  even  with  these  more  benign  justifications,  the  history  of  past  mergers 

is far from encouraging. 16 

Antitrust  analysis  recognizes  that  the  failing  firm  defense  will  allow  apparently 
anticompetitive  mergers  to  go  forward  when  they  would  not  usually  pass  muster. 
However,  this  defense  is  valid  only  in  the  context  of  an  industry  that  is  otherwise 
competitive and exhibits a healthy competitive structure. That is not the case within 
the airline industry. 

This  is  an  infrastructure  industry  of  vital  importance  to  the  Nation  and  there  is 
serious  doubt  that  the  current  approach  to  industrial  organization  can  provide  the 
full, nationwide service that a continental, world class economy needs. Policymakers 
face a fundamental challenge. If these mergers go forward under the claim that they 
are necessary to save the industry, then the basic premises of the approach to public 
policy must be questioned because the fiction of competition can no longer be main-
tained for a large part of the Nation. 

This  Committee  does  not  review  mergers,  but  it  has  the  ultimate  responsibility 
for  the  public  policy  that  deeply  affects  the  industrial  organization  of  the  industry. 
I  urge  you  to  send  a  strong  signal  that  if  the  industry  tries  to  go  down  the  path 
of  massive  consolidation  it  will  find  a  Congress  ready,  willing,  and  able  to  prevent 
the abuse of consumers that inevitably follows from such a concentrated market. 

The  assumption  that  markets  are  the  best  way  to  organize  an  industry  is  just 
that,  an  assumption.  The  assumption  must  be  rebuttable,  if  economics  is  to  be  an 
empirical  science.  Policymakers  must  accept  that  sometimes  there  are  market  fail-
ures  and  take  the  appropriate  actions  to  ameliorate  the  problem. 17 In  the  airline 
industry,  with  its  boom  and  bust  cycles,  its  fits  and  starts  of  competition,  and  for-
tress hubs, where half the markets are competitive and half are captive monopolies 
a potential merger wave demands close scrutiny. 

There are a range of policies that could be pursued. 
First, if the Congress wants to stick to the market model, it must urge regulatory 
authorities  to  just  say  no  to  those  mergers  that  are  anticompetitive.  Certainly,  the 
US  Air-Delta  and  United-Continental  mergers  fit  the  bill.  Close  analysis  of  route

breathing  room,  thanks  to  fundamental  restructurings  and  somewhat  higher  fares.  That,  in

2007,’’ KiplingerForecasts.com. After several years of financial darkness, U.S. airlines are seeing 
rays of hope. Passenger demand is stronger and costs are under control. 

15 Ed Perkins, ‘‘Are Airline Mergers Good of Bad for Consumers?,’’ Smarter Travel, November 
30, 2006: One overriding fact governs the outcome: The Incentive for the merger is almost solely 
to reduce competition. In the past, airlines have merged for three basic reasons: (1) The earliest 
focused  mainly  on  extended  geographic  scope,  such  as  Delta  with  Western,  US  Airways  with 
PSA, American with Reno, and even the recent America West with US Airways; (2) A few prior 
mergers  were  designed  to  rescue  a  failing  line,  such  as  American  with  TWA;  and  (3)  Some  of 
the earlier mergers were designed to take advantage of the economics so scale, such as the con-
solidation of several smaller lines into Hughes Airwest. But even the industry now admits that 
future  mergers  among  mega-carriers  will  be  aimed  almost  solely  at  reducing  competition. 
They’re  already  so  big  that  extra  size  doesn’t  help  lower  costs,  and  they  already  cover  most  of 
the  Nation.  But  reduced  competition  would  likely  produce  many  rewards,  allowing  the  remain-
ing  airlines  to  hike  rates—and  probably  reduce  service  levels—even  further.  Also,  mergers 
would  probably  involve  the  shutting  down  of  several  adjacent  ‘‘hubs,’’  where  local  travelers 
would see substantial reductions in service. 

16 Jerry Chandler, ‘‘Airline Mergers? Not So Fast,’’ Cheap Flights Limited, December 15, 2006: 
Of  the  six  major  mergers  I  just  touched  on,  four  essentially  failed  to  live  up  to  their  purported 
promise—US  Air/Piedmont,  US  Air/PSA,  Northwest/Republic,  and  Pan  Am/National.  A  fifth, 
American/TWA,  resulted  in  the  downsizing  of  St.  Louis.  Only  Delta/Western  really  worked  for 
airlines and airline passengers alike. No, past history doesn’t dictate present success.

overlap  and  hub  proximity  suggests  that  these  mergers  will  have  substantial  anti- 
competitive  effects  that  will  be  impossible  to  ameliorate  with  traditional  antitrust 
remedies. 18 

Traditional  antitrust  remedies  for  the  anticompetitive  effects  of  mergers  are  not 
likely  to  be  effective  in  these  cases.  The  spin-off  of  some  assets  to  repair  the  com-
petitive  harms  in  the  markets  would  occur  in  city-pairs  that  are  already  insuffi-
ciently  competitive.  They  have  not  experienced  competitive  entry  and  it  is  difficult 
to see how the spin-off will result in sustained competition if these mergers are ap-
proved.  Consumers  would  suffer  severe  price  increases  before  entry  might  occur. 19 
The  antitrust  authorities  will  also  have  to  micro-manage  the  gates  and  slots  at 
regional  hubs  where  the  merger  eliminates  competition  to  ensure  that  they  result 
in  sustained  competition  on  a  large  number  of  routes.  If  not,  consumers  would  be 
left with reduced competition and declining service, but this is an approach the anti-
trust  authorities  hesitate  to  take  and  generally  refuse  to  engage  in  for  the  long 
term. 

Broader  policies  to  protect  consumers  in  an  industry  were  competition  is  weak-
ened  generally  fall  outside  of  the  purview  of  the  anti-trust  authorities. 20 Occasion-
ally,  an  antitrust  consent  decree  will  set  prices  for  a  short  period  of  time,  although 
that  is  frequently  for  inputs  in  a  vertically  integrated  production  chain,  not  retail 
prices to the public. 

Merger  waves  start  with  one  deal  and  the  antitrust  authorities  tend  not  to  take 
a  broad  view  of  the  wave. 21 They  simply  cannot  see  the  forest  for  the  trees.  It  is 
the  Congress  that  must  take  the  broad  view  and  recognize  that  when  it  comes  to 
competition,  a  forest  with  too  few  trees  is  very  bad  for  consumers.  The  best  way  to 
stop the wave is to stop the first merger, which would be Delta-US Air in this case, 
particularly when it has such pervasive anticompetitive effects. 

In  sum,  the  antitrust  authorities  cannot  approve  mergers,  like  Delta-US  Air  or 
similar  mergers  and  pretend  that  competition  will  protect  consumers  in  the  large 
number  of  markets  that  are  presently  inadequately  competitive  and  in  which  com-
petition  will  be  further  reduced.  If  antitrust  authorities  conclude  that  consolidation 
is  necessary  to  restore  the  financial  health  of  the  industry,  then  they,  along  with 
the  Congress,  must  give  up  the  fiction  of  market  competition  as  the  primary  ap-

18 Brad Foss, ‘‘Airline Mergers Could Raise Fares in 2007,’’ KiplingerForecasts.com: Regulators 
could look at the combined airlines added strength in the Northeast as detrimental to competi-
tion, with Continental’s Newark hub and United’s at Washington-Dulles. Marilyn Geewax, ‘‘Key

with  hubs  in  Atlanta  and  Charlotte,  NC.  Justin  Bachman,  ‘‘Airline  Mergers:  Ready  for  Take-
off?,’’ BusinessWeek.com, December 22, 2006: Delta contends that such a behemoth would never 
pass  regulatory  muster  and  has  assembled  a  detailed  PowerPoint  scenario  of  job  cuts,  reduced 
flights,  hub  domination,  and  higher  fares  that  would  make  almost  any  consumer  advocate 
cringe. 

19 Ed Perkins, ‘‘Are Airline Mergers Good or Bad for Consumers?,’’ Smarter Travel, November 
30,  2006:  Not  all  air  travelers,  however,  will  feel  the  pinch  equally.  On  many  of  the  Nation’s 
busiest  routes,  low-fare  lines  such  as  AirTran,  JetBlue,  and  Southwest  will  continue  to  set  the 
ceiling  on  fares,  even  the  largest  old-time  airline  can’t  raise  fares  much.  Travelers  on  those 
routes  will  probably  see  little  effect.  But  travelers  to  or  from  smaller  cities,  where  no  low-fare 
line flies, are likely to get stung, big time. If US Airways acquires Delta, travelers in the South-
east are particularly likely to be gouged. 

20 Ed Perkins, ‘‘Are Airline Mergers Good of Bad for Consumers?,’’ Smarter Travel, November 
30, 2006: When it approves big airline mergers, the government often imposes conditions to pro-
tect  at  least  some  level  of  competition . . . In  my  view,  however,  it  is  time  for  a  different  gov-
ernment focus. Route adjustments are no longer as important as the once were. Instead, I’d like 
to  see  regulators  accept  the  inevitability  of  reduced  competition  and  require  merged  airlines  to 
provide  other  offsetting  benefits.  Among  the  possibilities:  (1)  Increased  compensation  for  invol-
untary  bumping.  (2)  Expanded  definition  of  bumping  to  include  factors  other  than  overbooking. 
(3) Compensation for delayed baggage delivery. (4) Guaranteed levels of seats for frequent flyers.

proach  to  industrial  organization  for  the  airline  industry.  They  must  provide  con-
sumers  with  much  greater  non-market  protections  against  the  abuse  of  the  market 
power that will inevitably result from a merger wave in this industry. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much, Dr. Cooper. 
I  now  call  upon  the  Chairman  of  the  full  Committee,  or  Vice 
Chairman of the full Committee, as he prefers to be called, for the 
first round of questions. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Secretary Steinberg, you’ve just heard Dr. Cooper’s testimony. Do 

you believe that his concerns are valid? 

Mr. STEINBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Any  time  there’s  consolidation,  we  have  to  look  at  the  effects  on 
consumers.  I  think  it’s  hard  to  generalize  about  any  specific—gen-
eralize  about  whether  mergers  are  ‘‘bad’’  or  ‘‘good’’  for  consumers. 
It’s highly dependent on the specifics of a transaction. 

In  general,  I  would  say  that,  that  healthy  network  carriers  that 
earn  adequate  profits  are  actually  good  for  smaller  communities, 
and  good  for  consumers,  because  they  can  afford  the  breadth  and 
scope of service that we want to deliver. 

In  any  situation  in  which  there’s  excess  concentration,  obviously 
we  have  to  be  careful  of  prices  going  up.  But,  I  think  what  we’ve 
seen over the years is an intensely competitive industry, character-
ized by many carriers. And today we have six network carriers, and 
we have several low-cost carriers. 

And, in fact, the most successful carrier by, really, any measure, 
is not the largest, at all. And that’s Southwest Airlines. So, it’s very 
hard  to  generalize  that  a  merger,  per  se,  will  lead  to  harm  to  con-
sumers. 

We do think there are execution risks in mergers, that can result 
in  bad  business  combinations.  But,  the  role  of  government,  obvi-
ously,  is  to  protect  consumers,  by  focusing  on  ease  of  entry  into 
markets, and the ability of the marketplace to support competition. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Can  you  assume  that  it  will  result  in  fewer 

choices? Higher prices for consumers? 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  Again,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  it  really  depends 
on  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Certainly,  in  the  short  term,  any 
merger  results—by  definition—in  fewer  choices.  But,  what  we’ve 
seen  over  the  years  is  a  tendency  of  the  marketplace  to  respond. 
And new carriers can come in and lower prices. 

And  that’s  not  to  say  that  we’re  proposing  mergers,  as  a  way  to 
‘‘save’’  the  industry.  Quite  to  the  contrary.  We’re  just  saying  the 
marketplace should be allowed to operate. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Grinstein,  do  you  believe  that  Dr.  Cooper’s 

concerns are valid? 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  I  do.  I  think  that  they’re  valid  because  this  in-
dustry—I’m  a  slow  learner—because  this  industry  has  improved 
itself  dramatically  in  the  last  2  or  3  years,  and  I  think  that  point 
is  well  taken.  If  you  look  back  2  or  3  years  ago,  the  network  car-
riers  were  on  the  run.  They  were  in  serious  trouble.  They  were  fi-
nancing  themselves  by  drawing  down  their  balance  sheets,  and 
they were failing in competition with the low-cost carriers. 

Since then, a number of us have restructured ourselves—most or 
many of them in bankruptcy, but some outside of bankruptcy—and 
in  that  process,  they  have  completely  rebuilt  the  way  they  operate

the  airlines.  In  Delta’s  case,  we’ve  gone  from  a  company  that  was 
18  percent  international,  up  to  35  percent,  and  headed  toward  50 
percent,  because  we’re  finding  that  a  better  use  of  our  equipment, 
and  a  much  more  stable  fare  environment.  So,  we’ve  completely 
changed things. 

In  the  process  of  doing  that,  the  low-cost  carriers  have  not  been 
as  fortunate.  And  what  was  predicted  as  straight  upward  growth 
has  changed.  In  the  case  of  AirTran,  they  have  deferred  deliveries 
of  aircraft;  in  the  case  of  JetBlue,  they  have  sold  airplanes,  and 
they, too, have deferred delivery of aircraft. 

So,  the  network  carriers  have  traction  now,  they  are  performing 
well.  The  business  plan  that  we  have,  and  that  I  think,  the  others 
have,  all  indicate  that  they’re  going  to  be  profitable  in  2007  and 
going  ahead  because  of  all  of  the  changes  made.  So,  I  think  that 
these—these  companies  have  gotten  the  traction,  and  I  think  that 
when  Dr.  Cooper  points  to  the  inherent  competitive—loss  of  com-
petitive force—from the public interest point of view, that that will 
happen  in  certain  mergers.  And  the  one  in  front  of  you  today  is, 
I think, blatantly anti-competitive. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Parker, what are your thoughts? 
Mr.  PARKER.  Well,  I  disagree.  And  I  point  back  to  the  success  of 
the  US  Airways/America  West  merger.  When,  in  fact,  what  we 
have  done  is  increased  service  that  would  not  be  there,  had  that 
merger not happened, saved jobs that wouldn’t be there, and given 
consumers more choice. 

I  believe  that  the  biggest  competitive  threat  to  the  network  car-
riers  are  the  low-cost  carriers,  and  for  those  who  have  concerns 
about  small  communities—which  those  low-cost  carriers  will  never 
serve—they  should  be  very  concerned  about  the  health  of  the  net-
work airlines. 

The low-cost carriers, since 2000, 2000 to now, have grown at 20 
percent per year. Not 20 percent in total, 20 percent per year, each 
year.  At  the  same  time,  network  airlines  have  shrunk,  each  year, 
about  3  percent.  That  is  not  a  good  trend  for  small  communities. 
Because if that trend continues, it won’t be long until network car-
riers  are  a  much,  much  smaller  percentage  of  the  total,  and  you 
will  continue  to  see  service  on  a  point-to-point  basis—not  to  those 
communities. 

We  need  to  encourage  an  airline  industry  that  allows  network 
carriers the ability to be profitable instead of having us in this con-
tinuous  cycle  of  coming  back  to  you  every  5  or  6  years  and  asking 
for help. And again, all I would ask is that we let competition con-
tinue under the laws in place. I believe, firmly, that the transaction 
we  propose  would  easily  pass  Department  of  Justice  scrutiny,  due 
to the fact that our industry is so intensely competitive. 

The CHAIRMAN. We have been told that the immediate impact of 
this  merger,  if  it  goes  through,  would  be  a  10  percent  reduction  in 
personnel, is that correct? 

Mr. PARKER. That is not correct. Our plan is to reduce the capac-
ity—and this may be the source of confusion—to reduce the capac-
ity  in  the  system  by  about  10  percent.  What  that  does  is  allow  us 
to reduce costs, and in doing so, still serve the same number of cus-
tomers.  This  in  turn  allows  us  to  compete  with  low-cost  carriers. 
So, as we reduce capacity by 10 percent, still serve all of these mar-

kets that are being served today, the result is we have lower costs, 
and retain the vast majority of the revenue. This is where the net-
work synergies are generated. 

As  it  relates  to  employees:  our  commitment  is  to  ensure  that  no 
front-line  employees  are  furloughed.  We  will  get  the  airline  right- 
sized  to  that  smaller  size  over  time,  but  the  right  way  to  do  that, 
as  we  found  in  our  past  merger,  is  allow  this  to  happen  through 
attrition—people  who  choose  to  leave,  of  course,  leave.  And  we 
don’t  need  to  replace  them  at  a  slightly  smaller  airline.  But  we 
would not reduce the employees by 10 percent upon the merger. 

What  we  would  do  is  allow  people  to  leave  of  their  own  volition, 
and not replace them over time. We find that to be—in addition to 
being  the  right  thing  for  our  employees  for  morale,  it’s  also  the 
right  business  decision.  Because  the  fact  of  the  matter  is—as  I 
noted  in  my  testimony—US  Airways/America  West,  which  reduced 
capacity even more than that, has already hired 4,000 people in the 
14 months since we completed that merger. So, it doesn’t make any 
sense to—the right business decision is to run with a slightly high-
er than necessary complement of employees through the transition 
period, and to not do any reductions in force immediately.

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
I  want  to  ask  just  two  questions  of  Mr.  Steinberg.  I’ve  been  told 
that  if  this  merger  goes  forward,  the  one  we’re  talking  about  here 
now,  that  it’s  just  the  first  of  a  series  of  mergers.  Do  you  predict 
that  if  this  merger  goes  forward,  there  will  be  a  series  of  mergers 
within the industry? 

Mr. STEINBERG. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. 
You  know,  we  often  hear  about  the  so-called  ‘‘domino  effect’’  if 
this  proposed  transaction,  or  a  similar  one,  goes  forward.  And  I 
think, as much as I’d like to say yes or no, and answer the question 
definitively, I don’t think we can. 

Management of the network carriers, I think, will have to evalu-
ate  their  competitive  position,  based  on  the  specifics  of  a  trans-
action,  if  it  goes  forward.  Mergers  are  difficult  things  to  pull  off 
successfully.  So,  it’s  no  easy  decision  to  simply  decide,  in  response 
to  a  competitor,  that  we’ll  go  buy  or  merge  with  another  compet-
itor.  Because,  as  I  said,  earlier  history  shows  that  most—but  not 
all—airline mergers have not succeeded. 

Mr. Grinstein and Mr. Parker—everyone around the table knows 
I’m  provincial—I  recently  had  a  report  that,  as  a  matter  of  fact, 
two of my staff were stuck in Fairbanks for 3 days and couldn’t get 

I  do  agree  that  size  and  scope  in  the  airline  business  are  impor-
tant,  and  therefore,  management  of  network  carriers  will  look  at 
the resulting competitive playing field and make a decision. But as 
to  this  particular  proposal,  I  think  it’s  very  hard  to  answer  your 
question definitively. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Thank  you.  I  hope  that  it  does  not  result  that 

way, if a merger takes place.

out  or  get  new  reservations.  Both  of  our  international  airports  are 
near  two  large  military  bases  with  all  the  change  and  rotations 
going on, it’s not sufficient air service. What effect would this merg-
er  have  on  states  like  mine?  Seventy  percent  of  our  cities  can  be 
reached  only  by  air,  and  the  major  carriers  are,  in  fact,  the  back-
bone of our total, across-the-state service. We are one-fifth the size 
of  the  United  States—are  we  going  to  lose  service,  in  terms  of  the 
number  of  flights,  if  this  merger  takes  place?  And  what’s  going  to 
be  the  effect  on  the  customers?  I  think  Dr.  Cooper’s  ringing  a  bell 
for  you  all,  I  hear  this  from  very  conservative  people  in  my  State. 
They’re  talking  about  asking  Congress  for  re-regulation  of  the  air-
lines,  because  of  the  lack  of  service.  Now,  what’s  going  to  happen 
if these mergers take place? 

Mr. Grinstein? 
Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  Well,  I  believe  that  that  necessarily  is  going  to 

result in loss and decline of service. 

Let  me  go  back  and  comment  about  something  that  will  lead  us 
into  that  question.  The  idea  that  the  America  West/US  Air  is  a 
model  for  what  would  happen  with  Delta  and  US  Air  is  a  strange 
flight of fancy. That was an end-to-end merger. There was virtually 
no overlap. America West was in extremis, and US Air’s Chairman 
said  that,  ‘‘We  have  burned  all  of  the  furniture,  and  the  company 
is in a death spiral.’’ 

But, these companies are not in death spirals, and they’re not at 
that  point.  And  what  they  need  are  the  opportunity  to  grow  and 
expand. I’ve mentioned earlier—— 

Senator STEVENS. Jerry, I only have two more minutes left. 
Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  OK,  I’m  going  to  build  to  that.  I  believe  this 
merger  will,  of  necessity,  lead  to  loss  of  service  opportunities,  re-
ductions  in  service.  If  you  believe  that  with  the  kind  of  debt  that 
this company is going to have, that you’re not going to reduce your 
hubs,  you’re  not  going  to  reduce  frequencies,  you’re  not  going  to 
consolidate  flights,  and  reduce  planes—you  believe  in  Tinker  Bell. 
It has to happen. 

Senator STEVENS. Thanks. 
Mr. Parker? 
Mr. PARKER. This merger would not result in any change in serv-
ice to Alaska. US Airways flies to Alaska, as does Delta. We would 
have no intention of changing that, nor the routes that are served, 
including  the  code  share  that  exists  today  with  Delta  within  Alas-
ka. 

Senator  STEVENS.  If  you  complete  this  merger,  do  you  con-

template any further additions to your company? 

Mr. PARKER. Excuse me, I’m sorry, Senator? 
Senator STEVENS. If you complete this merger, do you see that— 

you getting even bigger and forcing another merger? 

Mr. PARKER. Right now, we’re just focused on this one, and I—— 
Senator STEVENS. Where do you buy your airplanes? 
Mr.  PARKER.  We  haven’t  bought  an  airplane  in  quite  some  time, 
Senator. Our airline, like most network carriers have gone through 
reductions. 

We  do  have  in  our  fleet  today  a  combination  of  both  Boeing  and 
Airbus  airplanes—about  half  of  each.  We  are  currently  looking  to 
replace airplanes, and we have bids out to both of those companies.

If,  indeed,  this  merger  went  through,  that  would  significantly  tilt 
that balance toward Boeing. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Where  does  Delta  buy  their  airplanes,  Jerry? 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. We have an all-Boeing fleet. Senator, they are at 
57 percent Airbus, and they have the—they are the only American 
company to order the A–350 which will be the replacement aircraft 
for  the  767,  which  is  the  large  one  that  we  fly  now  in  our—most 
of our international markets. And we exist with an all-Boeing fleet. 
What you have to have—I mean, you can screw up a lot of things 
in  the  airline  industry,  but  you  have  to  have  fleet  simplification, 
and by having a consistent manufacturer and supplier, it gives you 
that opportunity. 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you for your courtesy. 
I must leave to make a quorum in another committee, Mr. Chair-

man. Thank you. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Stevens. 
A  slightly  offbeat  question.  If  consolidation  were  to  take  place 
within  the  airline  industry,  we  may  have  only  three  network  car-
riers  left,  and  these  three  carriers  would  control  80  percent  of  the 
market. I’ve dealt for 30 years with these exact same kinds of prob-
lems with the steel industry in West Virginia. The result has never 
been happy. The result has always been fewer employees, and mas-
sive conflicts and crises over health and retirement benefits. 

Now,  at  the  present  rate,  19  percent  of  the  share—nobody  has 
more  than  19  percent  of  the  passenger  aviation  market.  American 
has  19  percent,  United  has  15  percent,  Delta  has  15  percent, 
Northwest  has  10  percent,  Continental  has  10  percent,  Southwest 
has 9 percent, US Airways has 8.8 percent. 

Now,  Dr.  Cooper  might  suggest,  as  he  did,  that  maybe  the  Fed-
eral Government should return to regulating at least these markets 
where  competition  does  not  exist.  And  I  then,  sort  of,  throw  in  ad 
hoc,  ad  hominen  comment  to  Mr.  Steinberg  how  enthusiastic  he 
must be against the captive shipper problems in railroads, because 
he’s described that precisely with respect to airlines. So, a lot of the 
industry  analysts  anticipated  that  if  US  Airways/Delta  merger  oc-
curs, it would lead to the other four major carriers merging as fol-
lows: United and Continental, American and Northwest. 

If  this  occurs,  US  Airways  and  Delta  would  have  25  percent  of 
the  market,  United  and  Continental  would  have  26  percent  of  the 
market, America and Northwest would have 29 percent of the mar-
ket—these  three  carriers  would  control  80  percent  of  the  aviation 
market. 

So,  I  simply  take  you  back—Senator  Dorgan  and  I  are  very 
strong  advocates,  and  others  here,  Senator  Lott,  Senator  Snowe, 
many  others  here—are  very  upset  about  what  happens  in  end-of- 
the-food-chain  markets,  and  the  prices,  and  the  service.  We  have 
lost service, fundamentally. We can’t exist with that. We’re a state 
that’s  no  less  important  than  any  of  the  other  49.  We  treat  our-
selves as such, and we try to make policy which takes that into ac-
count.  What’s  wrong  with  that  idea,  other  than  it’s  unusual?  I 
would ask of the two CEOs. 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  It’s  interesting  you  raised  that,  Mr.  Chairman, 
because in 1999, this Committee adopted a resolution in opposition 
to  the  US  Air/United  Airlines  merger,  saying  that  it  would,  of  ne-

tion. 

cessity,  lead  to  three  network  carriers.  And,  so  history  is  now,  8 
years later, repeating itself. 

I  do  think,  Senator,  that  you  are  going  to  have  a  loss  of  service 

to small communities—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. That’s not answering my question. 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. I’m sorry, I must have misunderstood your ques-

Senator ROCKEFELLER. No. I assume the loss of service. 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. Right. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. What I’m asking is, should there cease to 
be a deregulated market in the, as Dr. Cooper, I believe, suggested, 
in  those  stressed,  rural,  end-of-the-food-chain  States,  where  there 
can be no other solution to adequate passenger traffic? 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  Well,  you  have  that  now,  in  the  sense  that  you 
have  assistance  for  Essential  Air  Service  to  certain  commu-
nities—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Essential Air Service doesn’t do anymore, 
Jerry Grinstein—I hate to say that to you, but it doesn’t do it any-
more. 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  Well,  there  are  a  number  of  communities  that 

are benefiting, there may be more that need it. 

Let me come at it, if I may, at another angle. I think the smaller 
communities  need  the  service,  and  that  this  Committee—recog-
nizing  its  public  interest  responsibilities—is  going  to  try  to  find  a 
way  to  get  it.  I’m  not  sure  that  it  has  to  be  done  by  re-regulation, 
or deregulation. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Why,  because  it’s  radical?  Or  because  it 

doesn’t make sense to you? 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. Well, I don’t have any difficulty with radical pro-
posals.  In  fact,  the  more  groundbreaking  they  are,  in  some  ways, 
the more interesting they get. So that is not my issue with it. 

But,  I  think  that  the  best  way  to  do  it  is  to  provide  incentives 
for  the  companies  to  serve  those  markets.  And  our  experience—— 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Incentives?  The  government  would  pro-

vide incentives? 

don’t tell me—— 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. Well, you may not do it in the form of cash. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Essential Air Service doesn’t do it, please 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  No,  no,  no—I  understand  that.  Essential  Air 
Service does some of it, but not enough of it. There are other ways 
of doing it. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  But  it’s  not  enough,  it  doesn’t  do  it.  It’s 
got to be enough, or it doesn’t count. I don’t want to interrupt you, 
but I want to give Mr. Parker a chance to respond. 

Mr.  PARKER.  I’d  be  happy  to.  Any  radical  ideas  you  have,  Sen-

ator, as to ways that we can improve service—— 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  No,  sensible  ideas  which  some  might  call 

Mr. PARKER. All right, perfect. Even better yet, sensible and rad-
ical  ideas—we’d  love  to  listen  to  them.  I  agree  with  your  concern 
that  providing  air  service  to  small  communities  is  becoming  more 
and more difficult. I would argue that the market force that’s caus-
ing  this  is  the  continued  decline  of  the  network  airlines.  And  left 
to  the  policies  we’ve  had  to  date—in  particular,  not  allowing  mar-

radical.

ket forces to work, as it relates to things like mergers and acquisi-
tions,  would  absolutely  result  in  a  weaker  set  of  service  to  small 
communities, because our airlines would be weaker and weaker. 

But  to  the  extent  that  you  or  anyone  else  has  sensible  and  rad-
ical ideas on ways that we can provide service in a way that is eco-
nomic to the airlines, we’d love to hear those. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  And  it  is  not  radical—I  would  say  to  my 
colleagues—it is not radical if it works for the small and rural com-
munities which are represented by so many of us around this table. 
It’s  only  radical  because  it  was  changed  earlier.  We  deregulated. 
And to not regulate the parts that don’t need it, but to regulate the 
parts that you both admit, do need it, and which can not be served 
properly,  unless  there’s  some  arrangement  of  that  sort,  I  think 
then bears Committee scrutiny. 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  You  know,  it’s  interesting,  Mr.  Chairman,  of  the 
209  domestic  markets  that  Delta  serves,  144  are  defined  as  ‘‘small 
markets’’ by the FAA. So, our system of network carriage that has 
the types of aircraft that can feed those into hubs and then deliver 
them  into  markets  is  exactly  what  you  want  to  have  happening, 
and that’s exactly the mission that we have, as a company. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Good. 
Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Senator. 
My  home  is  in  Minnesota,  and  as  you  know,  that’s  the  home  of 
Northwest Airlines, with Minneapolis/St. Paul as its hub, with over 
30,000  employees,  serving  millions  of  Minnesotans  as  well  as  peo-
ple  across  the  country.  I  know  my  colleague  from  South  Dakota 
knows this is true. 

And  Northwest,  as  you  know,  is  also  in  bankruptcy.  And  when 
I  was  hearing  the  Senator  from  Georgia  talk  about  the  sacrifices 
of the employees of Delta during this time, I thought about our own 
employees  at  Northwest  Airlines—the  pilots,  the  flight  attendants, 
and the machinists, and everyone who joined together and took in-
credible cuts to be able to keep Northwest Airlines afloat. 

And, of course, I’m concerned about what happens here would be 
good  for  consumers,  and  for  employees  and  for  the  industry,  and 
isn’t just happening because bankruptcy provides an opportunity to 
do  something.  And  I  think  we  have  to  look  at  this  as  the  industry 
as a whole, instead of just this one incident. 

My  question,  first  of  all,  would  be  about—to  you,  Assistant  Sec-
retary. About the, this idea of alliances, as opposed to mergers. One 
thing that I know that Delta has been in alliance—correct me if I’m 
wrong—— 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. No, that’s true. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—with  Northwest,  as  well  as  with—and 
Northwest has also been in alliance with Continental. And in your 
testimony,  you  mentioned  briefly  this  concept  of  alliances.  And  I 
just  wondered  if  you  could  elaborate  on  that  more,  and  what  are 
the  prospects  for  these  type  of  alliances  that  fall  short  of  mergers, 
and what have they produced? 
Mr. STEINBERG. Thank you.

50 

Alliances  have  played  a  role  in  the  airline  industry  for  a  long 

time, actually. Co-Chairs go back, probably, 20 years or more. 

Generally  speaking,  alliances  have  been  most  effective  in  inter-
national  markets  that  are  otherwise  closed,  or  not,  not  completely 
open to our carriers. And they’ve been most effective in those mar-
kets. 

On the domestic front, of course, any proposed alliance has to be 
reviewed for antitrust considerations and they can raise some com-
petitive—competitive  issues.  Alliances  that  create  new  service  are 
good  for  consumers,  because  they  enable  passengers  to,  you  know, 
experience new product offerings. Alliances that are simply pricing 
agreements can be bad for consumers. 

I think, as the industry continues to restructure, what we’ll prob-
ably  see  is  less  of  a  focus  on  alliances,  domestically,  and  either 
stand-alone companies, or some other form of consolidation. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And then my other question would be along 
the lines of what Senator Rockefeller was asking about. And that’s, 
while we have a hub in Minnesota, we still have a number of com-
munities  that  are  of  the—what  did  he  say?  The  ‘‘end-of-the-food- 
chain’’? And if you’ve ever landed in Bemidji, Minnesota in a snow-
storm,  you  know  what  I’m  talking  about.  And  I—and  you  didn’t 
have an opportunity to answer that, I’d just like—— 

Mr. STEINBERG. OK. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—your  answer  to  what  you’ve  seen  these 
consolidations  have  done  to  the  rural  communities  in  our  country. 
Mr.  STEINBERG.  Yes,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  address 

that, I think that is a very difficult question. 

Since September 11th, we’ve seen a growth in the number of Es-
sential  Air  Service  communities.  So,  with  the  decline  of  the  health 
of  the  network  carriers,  we’ve  seen  more  and  more  need  for  sub-
sidies. And that’s occurred during a period in which there, frankly, 
hasn’t  been  all  that  much  consolidation.  So,  I  think  the  issue  is: 
How  do  you  serve  these  markets  profitably?  The  reason  that  there 
isn’t  enough  service  today  is  that  airlines  can’t  make  money  serv-
ing  those  markets.  As  airlines  become  more  profitable,  and  their 
networks  become  larger,  it  becomes  that  much  easier  to  serve  so- 
called ‘‘thinner’’ markets with fewer passengers. 

So, I think, contrary to what some have suggested, actually hav-
ing  fewer,  healthier  network  carriers  might  end  up  resulting  in 
more service to your smaller communities, as they attempt to serve 
the entire country on a network basis. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  with  this  merger,  would  this  enlarge 

the network? Because you’re talking about—— 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  Well,  I  think  the  map,  you  know,  speaks  for 
itself,  and  I  don’t  really  want  to  comment  on  the  specifics  of  the 
transaction—I’ve  observed  where  the  hubs  are,  the  proposed,  com-
bined carrier. And we can all make our own, you know, judgments 
based on that. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Mr.  Parker,  do  you  have  anything  to  add? 
Mr.  PARKER.  No,  other  than  that  I  would  agree  with  Mr.  Stein-
berg, as I’ve already said. I firmly believe that strong network air-
lines in our current structure is what small communities need if— 
to ensure consistent and reliable air service. And, right now, we do 
not have strong network airlines.

51 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. Well I—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Go ahead. 
Mr.  GRINSTEIN.—on  the  alliance  issue,  I  think  that’s  one  of  the 
unexplored opportunities in the business. The—there are a number 
of  things  that  airlines  can  do  together,  without  affecting  price,  but 
which would provide for cooperation and modern technology, and so 
my  feeling  is  that  where  you  have  an  alliance,  as  we  have  with 
Northwest and Continental, that you should explore things such as: 
common  IT  platforms,  common  purchasing,  and  other  things  that 
produce significant cost savings, and move on. 

Oddly  enough,  I  agree  with  Mr.  Parker,  that  the  service  to  the 
smaller  communities  is  helped  by  healthy  network  carriers.  But, 
what you don’t want is to have one strong competitor swallowed up 
by  another  strong  competitor.  What  you  want  is  to  have  them  out 
competing  and  trying  to  expand  in  the  marketplace  and  develop 
that feed into the hubs. And so there are situations where, I think, 
mergers  may  strengthen  the  company.  But  where  there’s  a  signifi-
cant overlap, and I think that it’s going to lead, of necessity, to re-
ductions in service, as opposed to expansions. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
And  I  thank  each  of  you  for  your  very  persuasive  statements.  I 
think  we  ought  to  invest  in—more  in  railroading  in  this  country, 
and  Amtrak,  and  get  it  up  to  snuff,  so  that  we  can  relieve  some 
of the pressure that we see placed on the airline business. 

But  one  thing  I  don’t  understand  is,  how  these  little  guys  came 
into  the  industry,  and  came  under  your  tent  walls,  and  created 
such  good  businesses?  Why  didn’t  it  happen  with  the  legacy  air-
lines?  Why  weren’t  they  able  to  step  down,  or  whatever  they  had 
to  do  to  compete  with  these?  With  the  Blues  and  the  Southwests, 
and—? Mr. Parker? 

Mr.  PARKER.  First  off,  I  would  argue  that  it’s  good  to  have  a 
structure whereby startup airlines can come in. And if they can do 
a  better  job,  they  should  be  allowed  to  come  in.  And  these  airlines 
have figured out a better model. They’ve come in with a lower cost 
structure  than  we  have,  and  this  is  good  for  consumers  and  good 
for  the  United  States.  To  have  a  system  that  allows  competition, 
and  that  encourages  competition,  is  exactly  what  we  should  have. 
And what these airlines have done. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  that  is  business  that  you’d  like  to 

have—— 

ment does that statement make?

Mr. PARKER. Oh, would I like to have it? I’d prefer to own South-

west Airlines than US Airways, yes, sir.

Mr. PARKER. For the record, I don’t own either. But, my point is, 
the Southwest model is a much better model, but it can’t be recre-
ated.  They  have  done  a  very  good  job.  And  the  question—if  your 
question  is,  Why  didn’t  the  legacy  airlines  go  and  do  the  kind  of 
things that JetBlue has done? We didn’t have the cost structure at 
that time. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Let  me  ask  you  this.  You  made  a  bold 
commitment  here,  that  you  intend  to  reduce  capacity  of  the  com-
bined  airline  by  10  percent,  not  let  a  single  employee  go.  But,  10 
percent  of  the  system  may  involve  something  like  10,000  mainline 
jobs, and up to 200 aircraft. How will you keep so many employees 
around, and still satisfy Wall Street, and your obligation to pay off 
the other debt that you’re acquiring? 

Mr.  PARKER.  We  would  do  it  by  gradually,  over  time,  getting  to 
the  right  size.  The  aircraft  would  go  away  immediately,  through 
Delta’s  bankruptcy  process.  As  I’ve  already  stated,  as  it  relates  to 
the  employees,  our  view  is—because  we  need  very  much  to  have 
our  employees  working  with  us  on  this  transaction,  we  would  not 
go  and  furlough  any  front-line  employees.  What  we  would  do  is, 
allow those who want to leave, over time, to leave—— 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  let  me  put  the  question  this  way. 
Two  airlines  have  largely  different  fleets  of  aircraft.  One  of  the 
benefits  of  the  merger  is  the  fact  that  you  can  reduce  the  types  of 
aircraft that you utilize. Now, how do you do that, cut the capacity 
by 10 percent, and not let go of a single mechanic? 

Mr. PARKER. Actually, we would keep a mix of fleet types and in-
deed,  Senator,  I  do  want  to  be  clear—my  view  is  that  over  time, 
we  would  need  fewer  mechanics  than  the  two  airlines  have  today, 
initially. We would eventually hire them all back. But, the way we 
would get there would not be to go through and furlough members 
of  Mr.  Roach’s  Machinist  Union.  What  we  would  do  is,  leave  those 
around  until  people  decide  to  leave—which  they  do  in  our  busi-
ness—and we just wouldn’t replace them. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  time  is  short.  So,  I  want  to  ask  one 
last  thing  here,  of  you.  And  that  is—the  pension  benefit,  the  pen-
sion  were—obligations  were  reduced  by  $5  billion  as  a  result  of 
your reorganization. If you can come up with $5 billion in cash for 
the  merger,  shouldn’t  US  Airways  pay  those  pensions  back  before 
buying other airlines? 

[Applause.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I’m  sorry,  but  that  does  none  of  you  any 
good.  And,  if  that  happens  again,  those  who  make  such  interrup-
tion will be cleared from the room. 

Mr.  PARKER.  Senator,  as  you  well  know,  given  your  business 
background,  the  $5  billion  is  not  our  money.  And  indeed,  it’s  more 
than  $5  billion—we  actually  have  committed  financing  for  this 
merger  of  around  $8  billion  at  this  point—that  money  is  not  ours, 
that  money  is  Citigroup’s  money  and  Morgan  Stanley’s  money, 
which they are willing to loan to us if we do this transaction. We’re 
not  using  cash  on  hand,  and  we  don’t  have  anything  like  that 
amount  of  cash  on  hand.  They’re  willing  to  loan  it  to  us  for  this 
transaction.  Your  suggestion  is  much  like  someone  saying  to  the 
mortgage  lender,  ‘‘Please  lend  me  the  money,  but  I  don’t  want  to 
buy the house.’’ That money only comes to us if we acquire the air-

line,  because  they  know  full-well  the  value  that  can  be  created  by 
putting  these  two  companies  together,  and  they  know  they  will  be 
paid back. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  That’s  a  very  large  hope,  and  I’m  con-

cerned about that. 

Mr. Grinstein, how large were the bonuses paid in your company 
when  the  bankruptcy  proceedings  came  along?  You  said  that  after 
December  2004,  you  had  gotten  past  the  bankruptcy  issue.  How 
long  did  it  take  before  you  filed,  and  what  did  you  do  about  bo-
nuses to the senior executives during that period? 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. I—we filed in 2005. There were no bonuses paid. 
We did not seek KERPs—Key Employee Retention Programs when 
we filed, although we could have, legally. And there are no bonuses 
in  place  now  for  any  executive,  at  all.  They,  the,  everyone  gets  a 
flat salary, and that’s it. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. So, there haven’t been any bonuses paid in 

the last couple of years? 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  No,  that  is  correct,  Senator.  There  have  been  no 

bonuses paid in the last couple of years. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  All  opening  statements  are  included  in 

the record, as will yours be. 

Senator Snowe? 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Obviously, as one who represents a rural State, I’ve seen the evo-
lution  of  deregulation  since  1978.  There’s  no  question  that  rural 
States, like Maine, and West Virginia, and North Dakota, have ex-
perienced,  you  know,  the  downside  of  deregulation  and  borne  the 
brunt, you know, of higher costs and less service. 

Now, we’ve been fortunate to have benefited by both US Air and 
Delta  services  to  Maine.  You  know,  we’re  essentially  regional  air-
ports,  or  Essential  Air  Service.  There’s  also—I  think  it’s  indis-
putable—that  rural  states  have,  you  know,  bore  the  dispropor-
tionate  burden  any  time  there  is  consolidation  or  any  times  there 
are  difficulties  within  the  industry.  I  think  it’s  important  for  this 
Committee  to  examine  the  overall  issue  of  these  mega-mergers.  I 
think  we’re  on  the  cusp  of  more,  potentially,  and  I  think  we  really 
do have to examine the risks, and the ramifications for, you know, 
the  entire  country.  And  when  I  looked  at  that  map  of  the  overlap-
ping hub structure, that concerns me, and the whole network. 

Because,  I  think  what’s  different,  in  this  instant,  Mr.  Parker, 
than  the  merger  you  had  with  America  West,  is  the  fact  that  you 
weren’t overlapping network structures. So, the inevitable will hap-
pen. Which is to say that we’re going to, you know, lose service and 
also, I think, result in higher prices. One or the other. And, frank-
ly,  our  areas  of  the  country  are  ones  to  first  experience  higher 
prices  and  less  service.  And  the  last  to  reap  the  benefits  of  any 
change. 

So,  you  know,  I  hear  what  you’re  saying.  It’s  hard,  you  know, 
down  the  road—today,  you  know,  you’ve  obviously  expressed  good 
intentions about, you know, maintaining the same service, not fur-
loughing personnel. On the other hand, what does it mean for even,

you  know,  the  short  term,  or  the  long  term  and  how  viable  that 
could be, given the fact that you’re assuming a debt load of $24 bil-
lion? Doesn’t that put your airline even in greater risk, potentially? 
What  I  hear  the  choice  is,  that  you’re  not  going  to  get  the  low- 
cost carriers into your smaller markets, and that’s true. And that’s 
true.  On  the  other  hand,  we’re  left  with  the  choice  of  having  one 
dominant  carrier,  potentially,  in  our  smaller  markets.  But,  if  you 
should  fail,  then  what  do  we  have?  And  I  think  that  is  the  risk 
here. 

It’s hard to believe that we’ll continue the same service. And two 
of our airports, in Portland and Bangor, for example, if we had this 
combination,  then  we  would  have  11  or  12  city  pairs.  Without  any 
competition,  that  would  really  represent  a  market  share  of  more 
than 90 percent of the passengers. 

So,  I’d  like  to  hear  from  you  how  you  think  it  will  not  increase 
the  risk  to  your  company,  leveraging  this  kind  of  debt  for  the  fu-
ture. 

Mr. PARKER. I’m happy to answer that, and to go back and cover 

your overlap question, as well. 

As  it  relates  to  the  debt  load,  an  absolute  level  of  debt  is  not  a 
particularly meaningful number in and of itself. For example, Gen-
eral  Electric  has  $400  billion  of  debt.  General  Electric  is  an  enor-
mous  company  that  has  enormous  profits.  What  matters  is  if  you 
can service the debt. 

What  we  have,  in  this  case,  is  a  larger  airline,  that  has  higher 
profitability,  and  as  a  result,  can  service  the  debt.  And  I  feel  ex-
tremely  comfortable  that  the  balance  sheet  that  the  US  Airways/ 
Delta  merger  creates,  would  be  the  strongest  in  the  industry. 
Today,  US  Airways  is  the  strongest.  The  new  US  Airways  would 
be  the  strongest  of  the  network  airlines  in  terms  of  debt,  so,  I  do 
not  believe  that  is  a  concern.  But  thank  you  for  the  concern,  and 
believe me, it’s something we’re extremely focused upon. 

As  it  relates  to  the  overlap  question,  and  as  it  relates  to  small 
cities  like  those  in  Maine:  First  off,  on  the  overlap  piece—it  is  not 
the  number  of  overlaps  that  matter,  it  is  the  extent  of  competition 
on  those  overlaps.  And  again,  when  you  take  the  time  to  actually, 
not  just  look  at  a  map,  but  to  actually  go  and  do  the  analysis  on 
a  market-by-market  basis,  what  you  will  find,  is  that  those  mar-
kets are intensely competitive. 

Finally,  one  of  the  things  that  I  would  like  to  point  out  is,  our 
pricing  philosophy  at  US  Airways.  Coming  from  America  West—a 
low-cost carrier—we actually understand that if we try and charge 
people in places like Portland, Maine higher fares than are ration-
al, those people will end up driving to Manchester, as they’re doing 
today.  And  we  have  gone  through,  in  a  number  of  places  already 
throughout the country, and lowered fares. 

A  number  of  communities  who  have  submitted  letters  to  the 
Chairman about their support for this, without going through them 
all,  it  will  just  reference  the  final  sentence  from  Huntsville,  Ala-
bama,  it  says,  ‘‘Huntsville  International  feels  it’s  time  for  change, 
and  we  believe  that  Delta/US  Airways  should  be  given  the  chance 
to be the catalyst to foster lower fares, and more service, for small-
er communities.’’

One of the radical changes we’ve made, with our pricing philosophy 
at US Airways, one that you would see at the new Delta—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Snowe and Mr. Parker—I need to 
interrupt  at  this  moment  to  say  that  a  vote  is  gone  off,  and  what 
I  would  like  to  suggest  is  I  will  stay  here—Senator  Lott,  you’re 
next? 

Senator LOTT. If I could go, because I will—— 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Yes, you’re next, I hope you will stay, you 
are the next up, so that will have to be your judgment listening to 
that. 

But, we are going to try and just keep this going. But, if anybody 

leaves me out to dry, I’m going to remember it for 30 years. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. PARKER. I’m not getting up, Senator. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Yes, Senator Lott. 
Senator LOTT. May I proceed then? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman for having this hearing. Of 
course, it was described as a hearing on the state of the airline in-
dustry, and the health of the airline industry, broader than just the 
mergers. But, I think it’s a part of the process, it’s very important, 
we  need  to  think  very  carefully  about  how  we  do  our  job  this  year 
in  support  of  the  aviation  industry.  We  are  going  to  have  to  deal 
with  the  FAA  reauthorization,  and  so  to  have  these  hearings  are 
very, very good. 

Thanks—welcome all of you here, and thank you to our panel, all 
of  you,  for  your  testimony.  I  find  it  very  interesting.  To  the  two 
CEOs  here,  let  me  congratulate  both  of  you,  you  obviously  have 
been  doing  an  outstanding  job  as  the  head  of  your  airlines,  and 
you’ve made, you know, very fine statements here today. 

You  know,  we  are  making  progress  in  aviation.  I  do  think  the 
quality of our leadership, our CEOs, has improved, markedly, in re-
cent  years.  Your  industry—airlines  are  making  important  moves: 
coming out of bankruptcy, and even making money, Heaven forbid, 
and that’s all very good. 

I think that your merger with America West has worked well for 
you, but I’m a little concerned as you’re still working through that 
process, now you’re—you know, you’re making a big leap here, and 
trying to take on this next merger. 

And, I must say, you are an aggressive suitor. But the lady from 
the  South,  Atlanta,  does  not  seem  to  want  to  be  forced  into  this 
shotgun wedding. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LOTT.  And  so,  generally  speaking,  I  don’t  oppose  merg-
ers.  I  think  mergers  that  can  make  good  business  sense,  and  if 
they’re  not  anti-competitive,  completely,  or  cut  back  on  service,  let 
the process work.

But there’s something that does bother me, first of all, when it’s 

56 

a hostile effort. How do you respond to that, Mr. Parker? 

Mr. PARKER. Well, we didn’t want this to be hostile, indeed, we’d 
prefer  it  not  to  be.  But  I  fully  understand  Delta  management’s  re-
sponse. 

But  we  have  an  obligation  as  well,  Senator,  to  the  people  that 
I  work  for,  and  the  people  that  work  for  me,  to  do  what’s  best  for 
our  company,  and  to  ensure  that  we’re  building  a  company  that  is 
as strong as it can possibly be. And what I believe fully, is that US 
Airways,  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  is  an  outstanding  company  that’s 
going to have a fantastic stand-alone if this merger doesn’t happen. 
Having  said  that—and  furthermore,  as  much  as  I  enjoy  this,  I 
could  be  sitting  at  home  and  not  testifying  in  front  of  you  about 
why  it’s  so  important  to  do  this.  I  could  have  an  easier  life  than 
this,  Senator.  But  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  it’s  my  job,  to  go  do 
what  I—to  go  do  what  the  people  that  pay  me,  pay  me  to  do,  to 
go  try  and  build  something  better.  And  I  have  an  obligation  to  do 
that,  as  I  know  you  appreciate.  And  that’s  why  we’re  going  for-
ward. 

It’s  not—it’s  not  as  simple  as  when  someone  tells  you  ‘‘no,’’  you 
go away. When indeed, you have an obligation to fulfill for the peo-
ple that work for you. 

Senator LOTT. Have you made any commitments to your employ-
ees  about  transferring  bargaining  rights  to  the  merged  company? 
Mr. PARKER. No, sir, the situation is as follows. We have, as Mr. 
Roach  can  tell  you,  a  heavily  unionized  workforce  at  US  Airways. 
Delta has only one union—two, actually—but is not very unionized 
at  all.  What  we  have  said,  is  we  will  let  our  employees  decide.  We 
will  neither  ask  people  to  be  represented,  organized—by  organiza-
tions  that  they  don’t  want  to  be,  but  furthermore,  we’re  not  going 
to  fight  organization  efforts  from  union.  If  they  can  convince  peo-
ple, that’s what they want to do. We happen to believe that unions 
at  airlines  are  not  necessarily  a  bad  thing  that  need  to  be  fought. 
What  we  need  to  do  is  work  together  and  get  contracts  that  make 
sense.  But,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  we  will  not  oppose  if,  indeed, 
our employees decide that’s what they want to do—— 

Senator LOTT. All right, thank you. 
Mr.  Grinstein,  first,  thank  you  for  what  you’ve  done.  I  think 
you’ve  done  an  outstanding  job  at  Delta,  you’ve  made  a  lot  of 
progress. I presume, and hope that you’re getting ready to come out 
of  bankruptcy  and  you’re  going  to  retake  your  position  of  promi-
nence, of service in the aviation industry, and I appreciate that. I’m 
sorry you’re having to be tied up with this process when you really 
need to be, I think, focusing on other things. 

My  greatest  concern  is  that  this  could  mean  less  service.  You 
know, I just, I think when you look at the routes, duplication of the 
routes—I  mean,  it  would  lead  to  some  of  these  routes  being  elimi-
nated.  I  don’t  see  how  you  could  do  otherwise.  I  don’t  think  it 
would make good business sense in a merged arrangement. How do 
you respond? 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  Well,  of  course,  I  agree  with  that.  I  think  that 
when  you  get  into  the  level  of  debt  that  you’re  talking  about  with 
this company, that you’re going to have to trim it significantly, and 
among  the  things  that  you’re  going  to  trim  is  service  to  smaller

communities. And those markets that go from three to two competi-
tors,  and  from  two  to  one  competitors  are  going  to  pay  part  of  the 
price, and the other part of the price is you’re just not going to con-
tinue service in those. 

Senator  LOTT.  There’s  something  worse  than  prices  that  are  too 
high.  And  that’s  no  service.  We’ve  dealt  with  both  of  those.  Now, 
I  admit,  your  pricing  system  makes,  you  know—maybe  it  makes 
sense  to  you,  but  the  people  don’t  like  it,  don’t  appreciate  it.  And, 
you  pay  an  outrageous  price  to  fly,  just  to  Atlanta.  And  then  you 
can  fly,  you  know,  all  over  the  dang  country,  to  the  big  cities,  for 
one-third the price. 

So, the main thing is, I want reasonable prices. Not outrageously 
low  prices—you  can’t  make  any  money  when  it  costs  more  for  gas 
to  drive  to  a  site  than  it  does  to  pay  for  a  plane  flight.  So,  I  do 
think  the  industry  as  a  whole  needs  to  have  some  system  that 
makes more sense in regard to fares, reasonable and fair fares. Not 
just necessarily $200 fare, but, you know, I think the risk here is— 
in  the  industry  as  a  whole—and  I  realize  there  are  some  small 
communities and areas where you’ve—maybe you’ve been providing 
service that doesn’t make sense. You’re not going to be able to con-
tinue to do it, you’re going to have to cut back. 

But,  this  merger  causes  me  concerns,  and  I  just  wanted  to  get 

that on the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Lott. 
There’s been a revision. We, in fact, have two votes. We are, how-
ever,  a  very  loyal  band  of  Commerce  Committee  Members,  we  will 
be back, and Mr. Steinberg—if you could maintain your position be-
tween those two CEOs—— 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. STEINBERG. I’ll keep them apart from each other. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  We  would  appreciate  it.  About  15  min-

utes. 

[Recess.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. We’re waiting for Senator Dorgan, who is 
on  his  way  back.  And,  for  Senator  Cantwell,  who  is  on  her  way 
back. And people can talk. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Steinberg, maybe I’ll just take advan-
tage of my colleague’s absence, and simply ask you that—this ques-
tion. 

Mr. Parker testified that there would be very little impact on the 
communities  if  the  proposed  merger  went  through,  Mr.  Grinstein 
testified  that  there  would  be  significant  negative  impact.  In  evalu-
ating  mergers—which  I’m  sure  you  have—and  their  impact  on 
small,  smaller  communities—have  you  come  up  with  any  wisdom? 
Mr.  STEINBERG.  Senator  Rockefeller,  I  think  that  the  answer  to 
the question of what will happen, of course, very much depends on 
the  decisions  that  a  combined  entity  would  make  about  continu-
ation of the hub structure that’s now in place. Obviously, it stands 
to  reason  that  if  the  result  of  the  transaction  that  a  hub  is 
downsized  or  closed,  then  you  probably  would  see  a  reduction  of 
some sort, in service, to some communities. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  You  are,  you’re  astudiously  and  admi-

rably neutral.

[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Let me try this—— 
Mr. STEINBERG. Well—— 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Would  it  be  possible  to  construct  a  care-
fully  regulated  service  into  carefully  selected  rural  communities 
who  really  do  depend  on  it,  and  unlike  captive  shippers,  who  do, 
then,  raise  the  price  to  whatever  they  want,  regardless  of  their 
protestations—have dual capacity in those areas? 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  I  think  we  need  to  work  hard  to  find  a  way  to 
improve service to small communities, because clearly that remains 
to  be  the  biggest  problem  from  deregulation.  I  don’t  think  that  re- 
regulation  will  work.  And  the  reason  is,  that,  if  you  re-regulate 
service in small communities it won’t, by definition, have an impact 
on  service  elsewhere.  There’s  no  way  to  separate  out  the  markets. 

I do think that—— 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Well,  then,  is  there  a  construct,  which 
does not involve re-regulation, which is not there for impact on the 
rest of the route? 

Mr. STEINBERG. Yes. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Is  there  a  construct  which  you  have 

thought of, which has been kicked around—— 

Mr. STEINBERG. Yes. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER.—which could be possible? 
Mr.  STEINBERG.  One  of  the  things  that  we’re  at  the  beginning 
stages  of  looking  at  is  ways  to  encourage  more  service  to  small 
communities  through  the  use  of  the  new  class  of  jets  that  are  out 
there, which are smaller, cheaper to operate and—well, I can’t say 
that today they would allow such service—over the long-term, they 
should allow such service. 

If you combine a new fleet of, sometimes they’re called, very light 
jets  but  they’re  basically,  they’re  jets  that  carry  many  fewer  pas-
senger,  with  new  technologies  that  allow  us  to  aggregate  demand 
by  passengers.  And  you  can  envision,  at  some  point  in  the  future, 
a  much  more  vibrant  network  where  there  would  be,  what  we 
would  call  ‘‘on-demand’’  service  for  people  living  in  small  commu-
nities that could be operated profitably. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  A  final  question  before  I  yield  to  Senator 
Dorgan. Would these jets contemplate carrying more than 12 to 15 
passengers? 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  I  think  the  current  breed  of  jets  are  around  six 
passengers,  but  I  think  over  time,  what  you’ll  see  with  improve-
ments  in  manufacturing  these  composite  materials  is,  jets  of  all 
stripes,  if  you  will.  But  the  point  is,  that  they  are  jets,  so  the  cus-
tomer  experience  over  time  would  be  markedly  better  than  it  is 
today with smaller planes. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Those customers that get on. 
Can  I  ask  my  staff  to  work  with  you  to  try  and  figure  other 
ways?  I  think  there  is  a  solution  here,  I  don’t  think  it’s  easy,  it’s 
given  to  all  kinds  of  pre-determined,  horrible  words  like  re-regula-
tion, which is the railroad’s favorite word. But I don’t think it nec-
essarily has to come down to that, but it has to come down to some-
thing in that order. 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  I  would  very  much  welcome  the  opportunity  to 

do that——

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Mr. STEINBERG. This is a very high priority for us. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Senator Rockefeller, thank you very much. 
Mr. Steinberg, first with regard to your testimony—I’m a big fan 
of  the  marketplace,  I  used  to  teach  a  little  economics,  I  think  the 
market system is the best method of allocating goods and services, 
but  it  also  needs  a  referee.  And,  as  I  read  your  statement  it  is— 
the market forces have to determine everything. 

You know, I was telling somebody once about Judge Judy on tele-
vision,  that  out-of-sorts  television  judge  earns  $25  million  a  year, 
according  to  a  report  I  saw,  and  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  Supreme 
Court  earns,  what,  $180,000  or  $200,000  a  year.  That  market  sys-
tem.  Or  a  third  baseman  earning  the  equivalent  of  1,000  elemen-
tary school teachers—the market system. 

So,  I  love  the  market  system,  but  it  needs  a  referee.  Sometimes 
perverse  results  come  from  the  market  system.  And  if  we  are  only 
concerned  about  the  ‘‘market,’’  with  respect  to  air  service,  you 
know, it might well be the market would say air service only exists 
between major cities. 

I  just  want  to  make  a  couple  of  comments,  and  then  ask  some 
questions.  Deregulation  has  given  us  two  levels  of  air  service—one 
is an urban level of air service that is wonderful, if you’re fortunate 
enough  to  live  in  Chicago  and  want  to  travel  to  New  York,  or  Los 
Angeles,  God  bless  you,  you’re  going  to  have  lots  of  opportunities, 
and  competition  for  fares,  and  low  fares.  And  if  you,  however,  live 
in a rural area, tough luck. 

So,  you  can  go  to  a  travel  agent,  and  you  can  say  to  the  travel 
agent  this,  ‘‘I  want  to  travel  twice  as  far  and  pay  half  as  much,’’ 
and the travel agent would say, ‘‘Well, how about traveling half as 
far  and  paying  twice  as  much.’’  That’s  exactly  the  case,  traveling 
from  here  to  Los  Angeles,  or  here  to  Bismarck.  Do  I  like  that?  Of 
course not. I don’t think it makes any sense at all. 

Now,  there’s  a  natural  tension  here,  and  it  relates  to  this  hear-
ing,  tension  with  respect  to  the  airline  industry,  in  which  network 
carriers  have  created  post-deregulation  a  hub-and-spoke  system. 
And  unregulated  hub-and-spoke  system  in  which  the  big  airlines 
dominate  their  hubs.  I  like  the  hub-and-spoke  system,  because  it’s 
the only way the spokes get service into a hub, and then move any-
where. 

Other  airlines  have  decided,  ‘‘We’re  not  interested  in  hub-and- 
spoke  systems,  we  want  to  pick  city  pairs  where  we  can  make 
money.’’  And  so,  you  all,  Mr.  Parker,  you  with  really  a  wonderful 
look in your eyes as you contemplated owning Southwest—you look 
at  that  and  say,  ‘‘What  a  wonderful  model!’’  It’s  certainly  not  a 
wonderful  model  for  much  of  rural  America,  is  it?  Because  that 
model would obliterate the hub-and-spoke system. 

And  so,  I  say  all  that  because,  as  I  said,  if  you’re  leaving  today 
flying  across  the  country,  you’re  going  to  get  a  much  better  deal 
than  leaving  today  to  fly  halfway  across  the  country.  And  that’s  a

shame.  It’s  a  shame  for  a  lot  of  consumers  out  there  who  get  in-
jured by these policies and by these issues. 

I am not a fan of mergers. I’m not a fan of—I wasn’t a fan when 
United  wanted  to  buy  US  Air.  Mr.  Parker,  when  America  West 
wanted  to  buy  US  Air,  it  occurred  to  me  it  was  a  minnow  swal-
lowing  a  sick  whale.  And,  somehow,  apparently  something  has 
worked  here,  and  so,  good  for  you.  I  admire  that.  But,  look—that 
is  a  different  transaction,  America  West  buying  US  Air,  than  two 
network  carriers  deciding  that  they’re  going  to  marry  up.  Or,  in 
this case, there was no romance, so there’s not a marriage, it’s one 
network  carrier  saying,  ‘‘I’m  going  to  take  over  the  other  network 
carrier.’’ 

I’m not a big fan of that, because inevitably what is going to hap-
pen  is,  the  other  network  carriers  are  going  to  decide,  ‘‘We’ve  got 
to  merge.’’  It’s  going  to  be,  I  think,  American/Northwest,  Conti-
nental/United—we’re  going  to  see  transactions  in  those  areas.  And 
so, I don’t think that gives consumers more choices, I think it gives 
them  fewer  choices.  I  don’t  think  it  gives  them  more  competition, 
I  think  it  gives  them  less  competition.  I  think  concentration  is  the 
exact opposite of competition. 

So,  having  said  all  of  that,  let  me  ask  a  couple  of  questions,  if 
I  might.  Mr.  Parker,  you  first.  If  Delta  were  not  in  bankruptcy, 
would you be pursuing this transaction? 

Mr.  PARKER.  Most  likely  not.  I  can’t  say  that  for  certain,  of 
course,  but  most  likely  not.  Much  of  the  value  that  is  created  is 
through Delta’s bankruptcy, to restructure the route network by re-
turning aircraft to lessors, which is dramatically easier through the 
bankruptcy. 

Senator  DORGAN.  You  can  actually  abrogate  contracts  and  take 
those  assets,  the  airplane  assets  and  get  rid  of  them?  Bankruptcy 
gives  you  a  much,  a  much  more—I  should  say,  it  gives  you  an  op-
portunity  you  wouldn’t  have,  were  Delta  not  in  bankruptcy,  right? 
Mr.  PARKER.  It  makes  the  ability  to  return  aircraft  to  lessors 
easier,  which  is—we  believe  one  of  the  ways  of  reducing  the  cost 
structure  of  the  airline  to  compete  with  low-cost  carriers  is  one  of 
the  basic  tenants  of  this.  And  yes,  the  bankruptcy  process  facili-
tates that. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Airlines  have  had  very  significant  financial 
trouble—I  respect  and  understand  that.  It’s  been  tough,  especially 
for  the  network  carriers—for  a  lot  of  reasons.  But,  it  is  also  the 
case, I think, that some bankruptcy filings were a result of the pre-
vious  bankruptcy  bill  passed  by  Congress,  and  the  effective  date, 
and were defensive filings to allow them to do certain things to be-
come, perhaps, more competitive with low-cost carriers. Would that 
be the case, you think? I would ask either of the CEOs. 

Mr. PARKER. If they were defensive filings? 
Senator DORGAN. Yes. 
Mr.  PARKER.  Before  the  law?  I  don’t  know,  I  haven’t  filed  bank-

ruptcy. 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. The—if I understood your question, Did the com-
panies race to file before the new bankruptcy law took effect? Was 
that—— 

Senator DORGAN. Congress passed a new bankruptcy law—— 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. Right, right.

Senator  DORGAN.—it  had  an  effective  date  on  it,  and  there  were 
certain advantages to, to filing prior to the effective date. And some 
airlines,  I  believe,  took  advantage  of  that  for  their  own  reasons,  is 
that correct? 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. Well, I can only talk about Delta, because I don’t 
know—the  only  other  company  that  filed  at  the  same  time,  or  ap-
proximately  the  same  time—exactly  the  same  time—was  North-
west Airlines. 

But  in  our  case,  there  were  two  changes  that  Congress  made  in 
the bankruptcy law that affected it. One was the ability to get what 
we call KERBs, Key Employee Retention compensation pieces, and 
the  other  was  the  limit  on  the  amount  of  time  that  the  debtor— 
management had the right to oppose the plan. 

In Delta’s case, we did not ask for KERBs, so it was not relevant 
to us, the timing. And, we are well ahead of the schedule that was 
there. So, it was not a motivating factor for Delta, at all. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I’m  interested  in  what  this  proposal  means  for 
the  consumer,  the  employees  of  the  industry  and  finally,  for  the 
corporations  themselves.  I’m  not  unmindful  of  the  fact  that  you 
need to make a profit. We need to have an airline industry that is 
profitable—I  understand  that.  The  question  is,  how  is  it  struc-
tured? 

And  I  started  by  telling  you  that  I  have  great  angst  about  what 
has  happened  in  recent  years  since  deregulation.  I  don’t  think  de-
regulation  has  served  rural  interests  at  all,  rural  States’  interests 
at  all—I  think  it’s  been  devastating.  And  so,  as  I  take  a  look  at 
what’s  happening  in  these  kinds  of  discussions,  it  was  US  Air/ 
United  and  then  this  one,  and  this  would  be  followed  by,  at  least, 
two  or  three  more.  As  I  take  a  look  at  that,  it  doesn’t  seem  to  me 
like there’s any discussion of the type that Senator Rockefeller has 
been  asking  about—what  about  us?  What  about  the  folks  in  the 
rest  of  the  country?  I  mean,  tell  me,  if  you  would—both  of  you,  I 
guess,  perhaps  Mr.  Parker  first—tell  me  why  this  merger,  or  this 
acquisition  by  US  Air  is  the  best  choice  for  consumers,  employees, 
and  for  the  country?  And  Mr.  Grinstein,  tell  us  why  this  is  an 
awful choice, for the same groups, OK? 

Mr.  PARKER.  Right.  As  it  relates  to  consumers,  again,  the  con-
sumers  after  this  merger  would  have  more  choices  to  fly  to  more 
places, we would not eliminate service in any city that we fly, and 
you  would  have  the  benefit  of  a  stronger  airline.  And  getting  back 
to your small community question, Senator, I reiterate my firm be-
lief  that  the  best,  in  our  current  structure—notwithstanding  Sen-
ator  Rockefeller’s  ideas  that  he  may  have  on  changing  the  struc-
ture—in  the  current  structure,  the  best  way  to  ensure  that  small 
communities have continuous and good service is to ensure that the 
network  airlines  are  healthy.  And  that  has  been,  that  has  been 
much of the problem over the last, several years, in my view. Is the 
constant  churn  that  has  gone  through  network  airlines  that  make 
it—where you see communities like yours lose and add service, and 
lose  service.  And  it  also  creates  problems  for  all  of  the  employees, 
as well. 

Senator  DORGAN.  But,  Mr.  Parker,  I  don’t  disagree  with  you,  I 
agree  with  you  on  that  point.  I  think  it’s  important  that  network 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

airlines  be  healthy,  especially  those  that  have  hub-and-spoke  sys-
tems that serve our rural areas. 

But  your  airline  is  a  network  airline  and  you’ve  described  your 
health—you’re  making,  you’re  profitable  at  this  point—so  at  this 
point,  why  is  that  not  enough,  and  why,  why  is  there  not  a  risk 
for  you,  now,  to  absorb  another  major  airline—is  there  not  a  risk 
in  that,  to  move  you  to  a  situation  that  is  different  than  you  have 
today? 

Mr. PARKER. I think it dramatically reduces the risk of the com-
bined  companies.  Again,  and  again,  to  go  back  to  a  real-world  ex-
ample—we took America West Airlines that was not doing particu-
larly  well,  US  Airways  that  was  on  the  brink  of  liquidation,  the 
whale that the minnow swallowed, in your terms—— 
Senator DORGAN. Sick, actually, sick whale, I said. 
Mr.  PARKER.  Sick  whale.  Our  employees  said  we  were  hitching 
our  boat  to  the  Titanic.  So,  I  heard  all  of  those  things.  The  reality 
is, what happened is, we took that sick whale, we took that Titanic, 
and  we  turned  it  around.  And  small  communities  that  would  not 
have service today had we not gotten that—a number of small com-
munities  would  not  have  service  today  if  we  hadn’t  gotten  that 
done, and 30,000 employees would be out of work. 

Healthy network airlines are the most important thing in today’s 
structure  to  provide  service  to  small  communities.  I  believe  that  a 
merger  of  US  Airways  and  Delta  makes  both  of  our  companies 
stronger,  and  that,  therefore,  is  better  for  consumers  throughout 
the United States. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  appreciate  the  Chairman  indulging  me  on 
time,  I  know  my  colleague,  Senator  Cantwell,  has  questions  as 
well. 

I  want  to  make  the  point—you  could  make  the  same  argument, 
one  I  support,  about  strengthening  network  carriers—you  could 
make  the  same  argument  in  support  of  the  next  three  mergers 
coming up to one carrier, with a seamless transaction for the coun-
try.  It’s  important  for  the  health  of  the  network  carrier.  The  ques-
tion  is,  what  will  this  merger  really  mean  for  the  consumer,  and 
the rest of the country? 

And  if  I  might  ask  Mr.  Grinstein,  then,  to  answer  the  question, 
if  you  would,  why  is  this  a  terrible  idea  for  consumers,  employees, 
and for the country? 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  Well,  in  the  first  place,  we—these  are  not 
unhealthy companies at this point. I know that US Airways is pro-
jecting  a  profit  and  a  performance,  they’ve  indicated  already  that 
they’re  talking  about  fleet  replacement  and  discussing  that.  Delta 
has—is  on  a  business  plan  that  is—exceeding  its  business  plan, 
Delta’s  projection  is  that  it  will  be  profitable,  it  will  be  able  to  af-
ford aircraft, it will be able to compensate its employees, it will be 
able to give them the kinds of career satisfaction that they are enti-
tled to have, and it will be a growing company. 

As I mentioned, we’ve called back all of the pilots on our furlough 
list,  we  have  almost  called  all  of  our  flight  attendants  back  from 
the furlough list, so Delta is not a company that is unhealthy. They 
are  two  healthy  companies  that  are  competing  in  essentially  the 
same market.

I think it’s a bad deal for a number of reasons. In the first place, 
from the employee point of view, you want to have approximately— 
you  would  have  the  10  percent  cut.  You’re  talking  about  approxi-
mately  200  aircraft,  and  all  of  the  people  that  go  with  it.  What 
we’re listening to is, ‘‘I don’t intend to stop serving the hubs, I don’t 
intend  to  stop,  to  reduce  employment  other  than  by  attrition,  I 
don’t intend to raise fares,’’ but there’s no one to enforce it. 

If you take a look at St. Louis, when American bought TWA, they 
said, ‘‘We will expand international service, and we will expand do-
mestic  service.’’  If  you  take  a  look  there  today,  domestic  service  is 
down  about  60  percent,  there  are  about  70  percent  fewer  seats  on 
the  market,  and  the  low-cost  carriers,  Southwest,  has  gone  down 
18 percent. And there’s no international service except one a day— 
one a week—to Puerto Vallarta. 

So  if  history  tells  us  anything  about  it,  it  doesn’t  work.  And, 
you’re  going  to  have  lay  offs.  You  don’t  have  anyone  to  enforce 
that—it’s not a contract, it is—believe me, trust me, I’ve done it be-
fore.  But,  what  you’re  talking  about  with  America  West  and  US 
Airways is not an example like anything that will go ahead. 

But, in terms of service to small communities—are you better off 
with six network carriers, or are you better off with three? Are you 
better  off  with  more  hubs,  or  with  fewer  hubs?  Are  you  better  off 
having  those  network  carriers  fiercely  competing  with  each  other, 
trying  to  get  into  those  markets,  taking,  for  example,  Mr.  Stein-
berg’s  example  of  the  new,  very  light  jets  that  are  coming  in,  and 
trying to serve all of those markets to feed into a network? 

Because,  approve  this,  and  what  you  are  approving  sets  such  a 
low  standard  that—how  are  you  going  to  say  ‘‘no’’  to  Continental 
and  United?  How  are  you  going  to  say  ‘‘no’’  to  Northwest  and 
American?  You  will  devolve  into  three  network  carriers.  And  once 
that happens, you won’t get the same level of service. 

When we talk—let me just say a word about debt. The comment 
was that companies have huge debts, like General Electric. General 
Electric is a perfect example. 

In  General  Electric  capital,  they  have  about  a  $400  billion  debt. 
Three  hundred  and  ninety-five  billion  dollars  of  that  is  in  General 
Electric capital, because they’re constantly churning and trading it. 
But  in  the  rest  of  the  manufacturing  company,  they  only  have  a 
debt  of  about  $5  billion,  and  $100  billion  of  revenue.  So,  it’s  a  to-
tally diff—it’s like comparing the rock of Gibraltar to a sand dune. 
It’s a fundamentally different kind of business. 

When  you  look  at  the  frailty  and  the  fragility  and  the  volatility 
in this business, you can’t service that kind of debt without making 
fundamental  changes,  and  when  you  have  an  overlap  like  this, 
you’re  going  to  have  hub  reductions,  you’re  going  to  have  service 
reductions to smaller communities, you’re going to lose frequencies, 
and there is no way. And the history of it in US Airways’ own case, 
is  that  a  number  of—almost  70  percent  of—their  small  hubs  had 
significantly reduced service. 

So,  it  is  not  a  good  deal  for  the  consumer,  for  the  small  commu-
nity, and it sure as hell isn’t a good deal for all of these people who 
have  worked  so  damned  hard  for  Delta  Air  Lines,  and  have  in-
vested  their  careers  in  it,  and  they’re  entitled  to  get  the  benefits 
of it. And——

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Senator  Dorgan,  I’d  like  to  move  on  to 

Senator Cantwell. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, I hope to talk to Dr. Cooper and 
Mr.  Steinberg  at  some  point,  and  maybe  I  will  a  little  later,  but  I 
thank the witnesses for their responses. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Cantwell. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And  I  thank  Senator  Dorgan,  although  my  questions  are,  really, 
I  think,  along  the  lines  that  you  were  exploring,  which  I  think  is 
a very important issue. 

GAO recently did a report in 2006 that said since 1980, the aver-
age  fares  for  flights  over  1,500  miles  has  declined  by  52  percent, 
while those for trips shorter than 250 miles have just fallen 13 per-
cent.  So,  those  small  markets  that  you  were  just  alluding  to,  and 
that many of my colleagues alluded to earlier in their questioning, 
are  important  issues  for  us.  How  do  you  maintain  those  markets? 
How do you maintain competitive fares for those markets? So that’s 
something  that,  I  think,  is  very  important,  Mr.  Chairman,  in  this 
discussion. 

I  am  concerned  about  the  history  of  these  two  stories.  And,  I’m 
trying  to  understand,  Mr.  Parker,  and  Mr.  Grinstein,  about  this 
process. Delta has gone from $17 billion down to $7 billion in their 
reorganization  of  debt,  and  in  the  meantime,  basically  kept  pen-
sions  for  90,000  employees.  And  yes,  while  there  are  people  here 
today  that  represent  a  worker  agreement  on  10,000  of  those  em-
ployees for a new retirement plan. 

On  the  other  side,  US  Air  hasn’t  completed  its  merger  yet,  and 
yet  in  that  process,  you  know,  you’ve  come  to  the  U.S.  Senate  for 
$900 million in a package, a part of what was the post-9/11 efforts, 
and  in  the  meantime  dumped  the  pension  program  for  35,000  em-
ployees.  So,  I’m  not  sure  why  the  people  in  the  back  of  the  room 
really  aren’t  the  question  here,  the  picture  of  the  two  different  ap-
proaches. 

So,  Mr.  Grinstein  and  Mr.  Parker,  first  of  all,  I  want  to  ask  you 

if you plan to reinstate the defined benefit retirement plan? 

And  second,  Mr.  Grinstein,  I’d  like  to  ask  you,  How  did  you  go 
through  this  bankruptcy  process,  and  considering  these  pension 
programs,  as  it  relates  to  the  efficiencies  that  you  also  have  to 
achieve  in  trying  to  keep  this  balance  between  large  and  small 
markets? 

And  Dr.  Cooper,  last,  to  you,  do  you  think  that  US  Air  can 
achieve  these  efficiencies  that  it  is  describing  in  this  merger  and 
consolidation? 

Mr.  PARKER.  Thanks.  First  off,  as  it  relates  to  the  US  Airways 
pension  history,  I  wasn’t  there—to  be  clear—that  doesn’t  mean  I 
don’t know anything about it. But what I do—my understanding is 
that  without  terminating  the  pension  plans,  that  company  was 
going to liquidate. And they went through a bankruptcy court proc-
ess  to  do  that.  The  laws  that  have  since  been  passed  by  Congress, 
that I believe were good laws, were not in place then. Despite then- 
US Airways management trying to lobby for such a law, they didn’t

have the ability to do what Delta has the ability to do. So, the only 
choice  available  for  that  management  team,  my  understanding  is, 
was to terminate those plans. The alternative—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Will you reinstate them? 
Mr. PARKER. Well, as we move forward, if we move forward with 
the  Delta  plan,  we  would  abide  by  all  of  the—the  plans,  the  pen-
sions  would  be  exactly  the  same  as  the  Delta  employees  have 
today, we’d make no changes to it. 

Senator CANTWELL. How could you make no changes to it? 
Mr.  PARKER.  We  don’t  have  any  intention  to  change  the  exist-

Mr.  PARKER.  I  don’t  believe  the  company  can  afford  reinstating 

the pension plans for the US Airways employees. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  you  would  just—you  are  just  saying  you 
would  keep  the  good  business  practice  that  Delta  has  had  to  go 
through in its reorganization and its process, but not adhere to re-
instating those benefits for US Air employees. 

Mr.  PARKER.  The  benefits  for  the  US  Airways  employees  have 
been  assumed  by  the  PBGC,  and  that’s  where  that  obligation  lies. 
And we would abide by the obligations to the Delta employees and 
move forward. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Do  you  understand  how  that  sounds  to  a 
Member who voted for that $900 million bailout plan, and then the 
PCBG  is  picking  up  the  pensions,  and  you’re  asking  me  to  take 
over a larger airline that has gone through the hard work of bank-
ruptcy  and  making  these  decisions,  but  in  that  bankruptcy  deci-
sions,  basically  did  keep  the  pensions  for  the  majority  of  their  em-
ployees?  And  is  in  a  battle,  a  working  relationship  with  the  pilots 
that  are  here  today,  to  try  to  figure  out  how  to  move  forward?  So, 
there has been a lot of sacrifice and a lot of balance. 

Mr.  PARKER.  Oh,  absolutely.  And,  believe  me—this  is  not  about 
us  trying  to  ignore  the  sacrifices  that  have  happened  at  Delta  Air 
Lines. The people have been through an amazing amount, and the 
company  has  done  a  fantastic  job.  Never  have  we  stated  that  this 
is  about  our  ability  to  do  it  better  than  Delta  has  done  it,  I  think 
they’ve done an admirable job, I know the people have done a fan-
tastic  job  and  have  gone  through  a  number  of  concessions,  as  has 
the  entire  industry—including  the  people  of  US  Airways.  We  have 
all had to go through the same thing. 

What  I  believe,  unfortunately,  is  our  work  isn’t  done.  And,  if  all 
we  do  is  let  it  settle  with  a  bunch  of  airlines  coming  out  of  bank-
ruptcy,  and  then  going  back  to  where  we  were,  which  is,  ‘‘Oh,  fuel 
prices  are  falling,  the  economy’s  coming  back,  let’s  just  keep  the 
status  quo,’’  we’re  going  to  be  back  here  in  5  or  6  years,  Senator, 
asking you for other bailouts. And I don’t want to do that. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well—— 
Mr. PARKER. What I want to do is come up with a, with an indus-
try that can actually succeed through good times and bad times, so

we  don’t  have  to  go  ask  our  employees  for  concessions,  and  so  we 
don’t have to come back here and ask you to bail us out. 

Senator CANTWELL. Mr. Grinstein? 
Mr. GRINSTEIN. How did we get from 17 to 7? A variety of ways. 
We  basically  said  that  we  would  cut  $3  billion—$2  billion  of  costs 
out, and we would so restructure the airline that we’d add another 
billion in revenue. And I will tell you that we’re well ahead of that 
plan. 

We included in our calculation trying to retain those pensions, if 
we  could  get  Congress  to  pass  the  Pension  Protection  Act—and  as 
you  recall,  fortunately,  at  the  last  moment,  we  got  it.  And  so  we 
were able to honor the pensions of the 90,000 non-pilot employees. 
Some of it was renegotiating aircraft leases I mean, we were pay-
ing  $225,000  for  a  plane,  we’re  now  paying  $75,000.  We  had  to  go 
through the negotiations for airport leases and all of our suppliers, 
and  so  we  took  enormous  costs  out.  But  we  always  felt  that  we 
were going to be obligated—that we were obligated, a commitment 
had  been  made,  and  we  had  to  preserve  as  much  of  that  pension 
as we possibly could, and that has led us to where we are. 

The  creditors’  committee  represents  a  large  portion  of  the  debt, 
but  the  largest  single  group  of  our  creditors  would  be  the  PBGC, 
the pilots and the retirees. That’s how we got where we are. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  if  this  hostile  takeover  actually  hap-

pened, then instead of $7 billion, what would the debt be? 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. Twenty-four billion dollars. 
Senator CANTWELL. Dr. Cooper, on efficiencies? 
Dr. COOPER. Well, if you look at the story you’ve heard today: the 
route  overlap,  the  capacity  reductions,  the  labor  issues,  and  the 
promises that you’ve heard about, ‘‘We won’t cut this, we won’t cut 
that,’’—it  doesn’t  add  up.  And,  you  can  see  the  Members  of  this 
Committee—to  use  an  expression  from  a  lots  of  the  parts  of  the 
Members  of  this  Committee:  that  dog  won’t  hunt.  It  just  doesn’t 
add up. 

And  so,  in  the  end,  when  you  look  at  this  merger,  and  you’re 
being  given  examples  about  America  West,  US  Air—which  we  did 
not  oppose—completely  different  kind  of  merger.  You’re  told  that 
the  industry’s  going  to  go  back  to  where  it  was,  and  we’ll  be  back 
here asking for more money—this industry is different. It has radi-
cally  transformed  itself  in  the  last  5  years.  So,  the  story  just 
doesn’t make sense. 

If you look at the history of these kinds of mergers, where you’re 
eliminating  overlap,  where  you’re—clear  plans  to  dramatically  re-
duce  capacity,  you’re  either  creating  lots  of  monopoly  cities,  which 
you  are  then  subject  to  abuse  of  market  power,  or  you’re  going  to 
lose service. 

If  you  try  to  write  in  merger  conditions  all  of  the  promises  that 
were made here today, that company would squeal like a stuck pig. 
Tell you that, ‘‘Hey, we can’t go forward on this, the bankers would 
probably  bail.’’  Because,  if  you  try  and  do  the  math,  the  bankers 
will  look  and  say,  ‘‘Hey,  this  doesn’t  add  up  anymore,  we’re  not 
going to put our capital at risk.’’ 

So,  the  simple  fact  of  the  matter  is  that—and  this  Committee 
knows  full  well,  I’ve  heard  it  expressed—the  only  way  to  stop  this 
merger wave is to stop the first merger. If you don’t like the picture

you  see  at  the  end  of  the  three  or  four  mergers  that  are  being 
talked  about,  somebody  has  to  stand  up  and  say,  ‘‘Wait  a  minute, 
this one is anti-competitive.’’ 

If  we  want  to  have  network  carriers,  we  can  accomplish  this  in 
a  way  in  which  we  have  some  competition,  where  people  are 
healthy,  they’ve  shown  that  they  can  get  that  way,  they’ve  taken 
the  hard  steps,  and  to  allow  an  anti-competitive  merger,  I  think, 
consumers  will  be  hurt.  Because,  you  simply  are  eliminating  too 
much competition. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Mr.  Steinberg,  did  you  want  to  comment  on 
that  GAO  report  about  the  small  markets  only  having  a  slight  de-
crease  in  price  while  the  large  markets  had  all  the  competition 
which  would  lead  one  to  think  that  this  would  leave  the  smaller 
hubs with even more challenging times and higher prices? And for, 
you  know,  for  the  Washington  State  economy  and  I’m  assuming 
some  of  my  other  western  colleagues,  but  probably  it’s  in  lots  of 
other states whose economies depend on relationships like, between 
Seattle  and  Spokane  and  various  parts  of  our  State,  we  count  on 
having good competition for price and fare. 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  And  we  recognize  that.  One  of  the  explicit  goals 
of  DOT  in  looking  at  economic  issues  is  to  ensure  a  competitive 
breadth  of  service  to  small  communities,  which  means  enough 
flights at the right prices. The difficulty, of course, is that in a de-
regulated  environment,  there’s  only  so  much  the  Government  can 
do  to  make  that  happen.  This  is  the  observation  that  fares  have 
gone down in markets where there’s lots of competition and they’ve 
not gone down in other markets isn’t at all surprising to me. That’s 
what one would expect to happen. 

Deregulation  has  been  a  big  success  in  producing  low  fares  for, 
you  know,  millions  of  Americans  in  most  markets,  but  there’s  no 
question  that  in  some  of  the  smaller  markets,  it  has  not  been  as 
successful.  And  that’s  why  we  recognize  that  there  do  need  to  be 
other constructs for fixing the problem. 

But, going back to the discussion we had earlier, it does seem to 
me  that  healthy  network  carriers  will  support  more  service.  Be-
cause  the  first  service  to  go  when  they  start  losing  money  is  the 
service with the fewest passengers and the thinnest profit margins. 
That’s why I said earlier, since September 11th, without significant 
consolidation,  there  has  been  a  decline  in  service  to  small  commu-
nities. 

Senator CANTWELL. And I’m assuming you don’t define ‘‘healthy’’ 

as only two or three large carriers? 

Mr.  STEINBERG.  That’s,  you  know,  I  don’t  think  there’s  a  magic 
number.  There  are  industries  that  are  quite  competitive  where 
there  are  just  a  couple  of  companies,  like  UPS  and  FedEx  would 
be  an  example  of  one.  There  are  other  industries  where  you  need 
to  have  more  to  ensure  that  consumers  get  the  benefit  of  lower 
fares. 

But  as  I  said  in  my  opening  statement—this  industry,  you  don’t 
want to place too much reliance just on market share. Because you 
have  the  presence  of  companies  like  Southwest—and  admittedly, 
they  don’t  go  everywhere—that  have  had  an  enormous  impact  on 
the  fare  structure  generally.  You  have  an  environment  where, 
thanks to the Internet, essentially perfect pricing information, and

you  do  now  have  lower  cost  structures  which,  as  I  said  before,  I 
mean,  the  situation  we’re  now  in,  I  think,  we  can  say  for  the  first 
time, the network industry has the ability to provide low fares, but 
still make some profits. 

But  I  don’t  mean  to  minimize  the  significance  of  the  issue  that 
you  raise—it’s  a  very  important  issue,  with  obvious  economic  con-
sequences  for  the  communities  that  are  involved.  And  we  have  to 
work  very  hard,  and  I’d  like  to  work  with  the  Committee  on  ways 
we can incentivize more service. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  just  as  an  example,  the  wine  industry 
in Washington State, in Walla Walla is a growing, diverse industry. 
And  air  flight  service  into  that  area  is  of  great  economic  impor-
tance  to  a  whole  new  industry  that  hadn’t  previously  existed  so, 
getting good flights—— 

Dr. COOPER. The UPS/FedEx example really rung a bell, because 
you  know,  let’s  not  forget  we  have  the  Postal  Service.  And  we’ve 
got  a  firm  commitment  to  that.  And  UPS  and  FedEx  compete  for 
certain  kinds  of  traffic,  certain  types  of  packages,  in  certain  types 
of  markets.  And  that’s  essentially  the  kind  of  problem  we  have  in 
this industry. Is that, there’s a lot of the, you know, the small mar-
ket,  you  know,  simple  transportation  that  the  competitive  part 
won’t deliver. 

So,  that  analogy  is  actually,  it  rings  the  bell,  you  know,  we  still 
have  a  Postal  Service  that  moves  an  awful  lot  of  letters  that  the 
other two guys are not interested in moving. And, if you try to tell 
them, ‘‘Move those letters,’’ the price of delivering a letter, as much 
as  we  complain  about  it  today,  would  go  through  the  roof,  if  you 
left it to the marketplace. 

So, we’ve got this challenge of recognizing the broad public inter-
est,  and  also  having  the  benefits  of  competitive  markets  in  some 
places. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  your  in-
dulgence, and I hope that we’ll continue to look at this, as Dr. Coo-
per and others said. You know, there was a San Jose Mercury news 
article about how—I think it was an editorial—that lawyers, inves-
tors and bankers and airline executives come out as the likely win-
ners,  but  where  are  travelers  and  the  labor  unions  that  are  part 
of  this  organization?  So,  I  think  we  really  need  to  keep  our  eye  on 
this, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for this hearing. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. 
And  just  before—Senator  McCaskill  is  on  her  way  back,  hur-
riedly, and we have Senator Dorgan back, and I’m going to ask one 
more question. 

You  can  not  on  the  basis  of  America  being  America,  allow—not 
just  a  Walla  Walla,  which  has  a  coming  industry,  and  a  growing 
industry,  which  the  airlines  recognize—but  a  state  like  West  Vir-
ginia,  or  Montana,  or  South  Dakota  which  could  have  growing  in-
dustries  but  have  not  yet  shown  them.  But  if  there  were  air  serv-
ice, it would really make it possible, and it’s easy to prove. And my 
question  is  this,  to  both  of  the  CEOs:  If  we  were  to  try  to  find  a 
way to get both of you or other iterations of you into rural commu-
nities  by  means  other  than  the  classic  market  system,  would  you 
be  amenable?  And,  before  you  answer  that,  when  I  say  ‘‘re-regu-
late,’’ of course, the whole world goes crazy. I mean, I’ve seen CEOs

of  railroad  companies  levitate,  to  the  extent  that  they  could  levi-
tate. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  It  is  a  horrible  word.  So,  we  banish  that 
word from the dictionary, and we use creative, alternative thinking 
to  help  Americans  arrive  at  their  just  fruits,  and  communities 
which  do  everything  they  can  in  the  world  to  try  and  make  that 
attractive. Could you both live with an effort that Secretary Stein-
berg  and  a  number  of  us  made,  which  potentially  could  end  up 
being  in  law?  Or  being  in  practice?  Where  smaller  communities 
were served? Not just by Essential Air Service—you’ve got to have 
at  least  three  flights  a  day  to  do  anything,  OK?  That—you  don’t 
exist if you don’t have three flights a day. Would you be willing to 
listen to a construct of that sort? 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. The answer is, I would welcome the opportunity, 
on behalf of Delta, to work with the Department of Transportation 
to see if we can come up with something that addresses that. 

I  think  what  you’re  talking  about  is  something  that  recognizes, 
simultaneously,  the  needs  of  those  small  communities  and  also  is 
something that the airlines can do to provide adequate service, and 
still  work  toward  replacing  their  fleet  and  making  all  the  kind  of 
human and material investment—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Well, I was saying something more, I was 
saying something that Senator Dorgan said, former professor of ec-
onomics,  as  we  all  know.  And  that  is,  that  he  believes  fully  in  the 
free market system, but there has to be a referee. 

Small  American  communities,  who  have  real  Americans  who  go 
to  war,  to  fight  and  do  all  kinds  of  good  things  for  this  country 
have a right to a future. Would you be willing to contemplate a ref-
eree  of  how—whatever  description—to  see  if  we  can  solve  that 
problem? 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. If we can work with you toward defining the role 

of that referee, the answer is yes. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. That’s not an answer. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  You  have  to  work  with  the  Secretary  of 

Transportation. 

Mr. GRINSTEIN. OK. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  will  work  with  him,  and  therefore  you 
will  be  working  with  me,  but  you’ll  be  working  with  him,  so  there 
will be something more official about it. 

Mr. PARKER. My answer is yes. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Senator Dorgan? 
Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  saw  that  pained  look  on  your 

face when I came back—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  No,  no.  I  was  worried  that  you  weren’t 

going to stay long enough. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  Right.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  should  confess  at  the 
outset, I have been wrong about things with the airlines from time 
to  time.  And  I—at  a  previous  hearing  we  had  airline  CEOs  come 
and  testify,  and  it  was  during  restructuring  and  when  everything

was  changing,  and  I  said  to  them—they  talked  about  their  new 
market  plan  was  to  sell  food  to  passengers,  and  I  said,  ‘‘I  would 
like very much to get the list of the names of people who are actu-
ally willing to pay for airline food, I have some things to sell them 
myself.’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Senator DORGAN. It turns out I was wrong about that, I’ve actu-
ally been on airplanes and watched people buy food, so congratula-
tions. 

It is, you know, the airline industry is absolutely essential to this 
country.  This  country’s  economy  cannot  exist  without  a  health  air-
line industry. And, I think my colleague just described it very well 
a moment ago, my colleague, Senator Rockefeller. There are plenty 
of  areas  in  this  country  where,  but  for  better  airline  service,  there 
would  be  companies  that  might  well  want  to  do  business  there, 
might  well  want  to  create  a  plant  there,  hire  some  people  there. 
But, they see where that community is with respect to airline serv-
ice,  there’s  one  airline  coming  in  there,  because  they’ve  dominated 
a  hub  and  they’re  on  the  spoke—nobody  else  is  going  to  show  up 
to compete, because that’s not the way the system works anymore. 
So, they’re consigned forever to inadequate service. 

And  that—the  reason  I  wanted  to  come  back  is  just  to  explore 
this  tension  between  the  market  system—Mr.  Steinberg,  you  actu-
ally were worshipping in a couple of spots in this statement of the 
marketplace,  which  I  have  great  respect  for.  ‘‘By  deregulating  the 
airline  industry,’’  I’m  quoting  you,  ‘‘Congress  set  the  U.S.  Govern-
ment permanently on the path away from intervention in the mar-
ketplace.’’ 

You  know,  some  things  are  universal  in  nature.  For  example, 
telecommunications—we  work  on  that.  We  decide  it’s  much  higher 
cost  for  telephone  units  in  my  hometown  of  300  people—much 
higher  cost  per  unit,  than  in  Chicago.  But,  we  have  a  Universal 
Service  Fund  to  drive  down  those  costs  in  high-cost  areas.  Why? 
Because  universal  service  is  important.  A  telephone  in  my  home-
town makes the telephone in Donald Trump’s office more valuable, 
because he can call my hometown, not that he would. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator DORGAN. But, you understand my point? 
Mr. STEINBERG. Yes. 
Senator DORGAN. The same is true with air service. Not that ev-
erybody  should  get  it,  but  that  countries  should  not  have  a  divide 
in  which  you’ve  got  great  service,  multiple  choices,  lower  prices, 
then you’ve got folks out at the end of a spoke that are stuck. 

And,  Dr.  Cooper,  you’ve  talked  about  this  some,  let  me  ask  you 
this  question,  and  then,  I  see  my  colleague  Senator  McCaskill’s 
here and wants to inquire. If a hub-and-spoke system did not exist 
in this country at this point, isn’t it the case that many areas—far 
more  areas—would  have  no  service.  Is  anybody  going  to  come  in 
and  say,  ‘‘You  know,  the  city  pairs  I  want  to  serve—I  want  to  cre-
ate  an  airline,  because  I  want  to  serve  from  Bismarck  to  Eau 
Claire, Wisconsin, non-stop.’’ It won’t happen. 

So, what happens if a hub-and-spoke system does not exist? 
Dr.  COOPER.  Senator,  you  use  the  word  ‘‘pick,’’  that  the  new  en-
trants  ‘‘pick’’  the  cities—I  use  the  word  ‘‘cherry  pick,’’  which  gives

it a different connotation, because that’s exactly what will happen. 
We will lose these network carriers, that’s my first response. 

My  second  response  is,  we  actually  forget  our  history.  I  under-
stand  regulation  is  a  dirty  word  and  I  said  unregulated,  but  the 
point, we forget that we did not build these networks without sub-
stantial infusion of public funds—both railroad and airlines, right? 
We  gave  away  mail  contracts  and  made  them  very  lucrative,  we 
subsidized  airports,  we  gave  away  land  grants,  we  gave  telephone 
companies  franchises.  We  have  never  built—this  is  a  vast,  under- 
populated continent compared to the rest of the world. So, when we 
build these networks—whether it’s telecom or railroads or airlines, 
we understand that there is a public commitment. Mr. Parker talks 
about  coming  back  and  asking  for  help—well,  some  of  us  look  at 
this as a way you do public finance. And you understand the bene-
fits of making life in rural America bearable. 

So  we  have,  we  feed  ourselves  with  fewer  on  the  land  than  any-
body else in the history of the planet, by a mile. Precisely because, 
we understood over the last century that we were one country, and 
there’s  a  benefit  to  be  had  by  having  a  relatively  even  standard  of 
living. 

If  you  abandon—the  challenge  in  the  airline  industry,  unlike 
some of the other industries is that, there are lots of places it looks 
like  it  could  be  competitive.  And  so  we’ve  got  this,  what  I  called, 
an  airline  divide.  Just  sometimes  we  talk  about  the  digital  divide 
we’re  now  worried  about  in  telecom  in  rural  areas.  So  that,  you’ve 
got this problem of, you can show a significant number of markets 
where  competition  can  work.  And  we  tend  to  get  the  ideological 
statements  that,  therefore,  we  should  only  do  competition.  And  we 
stop  thinking  about  how  we  balance  those  two,  because  we  have 
lots of markets where it can’t work. 

Senator DORGAN. Dr. Cooper, my time is up. 
The  stakes  here  are  very  high.  This  is  a  subject  that’s  very  im-
portant—important to both of the carriers, but important to the en-
tire  country,  because  other  carriers  will  be  involved,  inevitably. 
And this has been a, for me, a very interesting opportunity. 

I,  the  Chairman  did  not,  but  I  did  resist  the  opportunity  to  talk 
about railroads, although I’ve got so much to say about the railroad 
issue, having worked with Senator Rockefeller on it. 

But,  I  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for  coming.  I  think  this  has 
been  a  great  dialogue,  and  an  important  dialogue  on  something 
that’s very important to the country. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. And it’s about to get even better. 
Senator McCaskill? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 

Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman 
for  the  patience,  and  Senator  Dorgan  for  continuing  to  find  out 
good information while I had an opportunity to get here. 

Let me first ask—thank you all for being here this morning—let 
me  first  ask  the  two  CEOs  to  give  us  the  total  amount  of  money 
that your airlines received from taxpayers since 9/11? 

Mr.  PARKER.  Received  from  taxpayers—the  U.S.—again,  I’ll  do 

my best.

The  old  America  West  received  a  loan  guarantee  per  the  Air 
Transportation  Stabilization  Act  of—by  recollection—$400  million. 
I  believe  US  Airways  received  one  of  approximately  a  billion  dol-
lars,  I  could  be  off  on  that  by  some  amount,  so  that’s  $1.4  billion, 
and  then  both  airlines  shared  in  their  fair  share  of  the  $5  billion 
that  Congress  delivered  in  a  grant  to  airlines,  also  as  part  of  the 
same act of 9/11. I don’t know what the share of the $5 billion was, 
probably something around $400 or $500 million. 

Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  Yes,  Delta  did  not  get  an  ATSB  loan,  they  did 
share  in  the  $5  billion  grant,  and  my  recollection  is  that  it  was 
somewhat less than a billion dollars. 

Senator MCCASKILL. And, refresh my memory—were both of your 

airlines profitable last year? 

Mr. PARKER. Ours was—last year being 2006? 
Senator MCCASKILL. Yes. 
Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  No.  We  were  in  bankruptcy  and  we  were  not 
profitable  last  year.  But  a  large  part  of  that  was  the  cost  of  bank-
ruptcy. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  You  know,  I  have  really  mixed  emotions 
about  this  subject.  I  care  very  much  about  the  health  of  American 
airlines,  for  many  different  reasons,  but  at  the  same  time,  I  have 
a  great  deal  of  angst  over  what  has  happened  to  the  former  TWA 
employees. 

Currently, there are only 7 percent of the former TWA workforce 
that are employed by American Airlines. They have just completed 
a study of 500 of the furloughed flight attendants. Forty-eight per-
cent of them are 55 or older; 58 percent of them are heads of house-
holds; 46 percent of them have not found full-time employment; 16 
percent have had to relocate to find employment; 47 percent report 
their  income  has  been  reduced  by  50  percent  or  more;  49  percent 
have  had  to  tap  into  their  401Ks,  their  IRAs  and  other  retirement 
funds;  42  percent  have  received  Federal,  state  or  local  charitable 
aid; 36 percent have had to move or downsize; 35 percent have de-
pleted  75  percent  or  more  of  their  savings;  42  percent  have  been 
diagnosed  with  a  medical  condition  since  furlough;  31  percent  re-
port  their  children’s  educational  needs  have  been  adversely  im-
pacted;  and  81  percent  report  their  lifestyle  has  been  negatively 
impacted since furlough. 

And, of course, I understand 9/11 happened. But, I also do know 
that  the  CEO  of  American  said  to  Congress  at  that  time  how  they 
were  going  to  take  care  of  the  TWA  employees.  And  TWA—Amer-
ican  was  profitable  last  year,  I  know  they’ve  struggled,  but  they 
were  profitable  last  year,  and  now  we  have  a  looming  issue  that, 
I think, has to be addressed by Congress, which is the recall rights 
of  some  of  those  employees,  that  their  recall  rights  are  expiring. 
And  some  think  they’re  expiring  because  American’s  waiting  them 
out, because of their seniority and the financial impact their re-em-
ployment would have on American. And if they just wait them out 
past  the  5  years,  then  they  can  hire  anew,  and  avoid  a  lot  of  the 
legacy costs. 

So,  I  would—and  by  the  way,  we  still  don’t  have  an  American 
flight  between  Kansas  City  and  St.  Louis.  I  believe  they’re  going 
to announce a new flight in Missouri, which I’m thrilled about, and 
I  congratulate  them  on  that,  but  we  have  one  option.  We’re  not

talking  about  between,  the  end-of-the-food-chain.  We’re  talking 
about  two  major  metropolitan  areas  in  Missouri,  and  there’s  one 
option for travelers. 

And,  so  I  would  appreciate  Mr.  Parker  and  Mr.  Grinstein,  and 

Mr. Steinberg, your comments on that. 

Mr. PARKER. I’m first, I guess. 
Again,  without—in  fairness  to  the  people  in  American,  who  I 
can’t  speak  for,  and  how  that  happened,  and  what  commitments 
they  made,  what  I  can  tell  you  is—the  statistics  you  rattled  off 
about  the  TWA  employees,  unfortunately  can  be  said  about  a  lot 
of  employees  in  our  industry.  It  happened  worse  to  TWA  in  total, 
because,  one,  that  airline  was  near  liquidation  when  American  ac-
quired it, and in doing so made the choice to put the TWA employ-
ees  at  the  bottom  of  the  seniority  scales  in  most  cases.  So,  when 
9/11  hit,  and  American  had  to  do  furloughs—like  all  of  us  did— 
those people were gone first. And I’m just—explaining facts, not an 
opinion  as  to  why  that—if  that  was  fair  or  not.  But  that’s  what 
happened to those employees. 

Those employees suffered, you know, again, the unfortunate sta-
tistics  you  rattled  off  can  be  said  about  US  Airways  employees, 
Delta  employees,  all  employees  of  legacy  airlines  who  have  gone 
through enormous angst. 

So, at any rate, what that means as it relates to this transaction, 
you know, all I can tell you, Senator, our view is, by putting these 
two companies together, we make them stronger. And we’re looking 
to make a stronger airline. 

I am not making promises that I do not believe, and I do not do 
that,  and  I  wouldn’t  do  that—everything  that  I’ve  said  about  com-
mitment  to  fares,  commitment  to  services  are  things  I  believe  and 
that we will do. And that I tell you with all sincerity. 

So,  again,  it’s  hard  for  me  to  try  and—to  try  and,  you  know,  go 
and,  go  back  to  what  happened  in  2000  with  American  and  TWA 
and  use  that  to  explain  what  can  happen  here.  But  all  I  can  tell 
you  is,  I  do  not  believe  it’s  a  parallel  situation  because—and  what 
I  can  tell  you  for  certain  is,  I  would  ask  that  you  don’t  take  the 
fact that people made commitments to you, and then—for whatever 
reason—weren’t able to—— 

Senator MCCASKILL. Well, I wasn’t here, I’m new. 
Mr. PARKER. Your constituents. Weren’t here, and weren’t able to 
deliver  upon  them.  I  would  just  ask  that  you  don’t  hold  that 
against  us,  and  the  commitments  we’re  making,  because  we  make 
these in all earnestness, and that’s what we believe is going to hap-
pen. 

Mr. STEINBERG. Thank you, Senator. 
The last 5 years has been, you know, as I said earlier, very pain-
ful for employees across the board. And, I think, something like we 
saw  in  that  loss  in  jobs  of  about  155,000  in  the  airline  industry, 
and  obviously,  the  TWA  jobs  were  part  of  that.  So,  there  has  been 
considerable pain, across the board. 

I  agree  with  Mr.  Parker  that—as  I  recall  it,  at  the  time,  TWA 
was  in  very  dire  straits.  It’s  not,  you  know,  therefore,  you  know, 
clear looking back that they would have survived, and you wouldn’t 
have had the same kinds of very painful dislocations.

The best way to prevent this from happening, again, is to ensure 
that  we  have  an  industry  that  can  both  produce  low  fares,  and 
profits  for  its  owners  and  increase  employment.  Over  time,  cities 
like  St.  Louis  have  had  difficulty,  historically,  supporting  a  hub. 
And  that’s  just  simply  a  function  of  the  size  of  the  population  and 
the  size  of  the  local  economy.  As  the  economy  improves,  I  think 
you’ll see, you know, the possibility of more service. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Yes,  because  now  our  taxpayers  have  in-

vested a lot of money in a new runway. 

Mr. STEINBERG. Yes, and you have a great—— 
Senator MCCASKILL. We have a saying—— 
Mr. STEINBERG.—a great airport. 
Senator MCCASKILL.—‘‘if you build it, they will come’’? 
Mr. STEINBERG. Yes. 
Senator MCCASKILL. Well, we only hope. 
Mr. STEINBERG. Thank you. 
Mr.  GRINSTEIN.  One  of  the  reasons  why  we’re  so  opposed  to  this 
merger is that it contemplates taking out 10 percent of the fleet of 
Delta, which is 200 aircraft. And, what you’d be looking at—despite 
all  of  the  assurances  that  you’re  going  to  maintain  employment  at 
the same level—200 aircraft is about the size of AirTran Airways— 
it  is  a  large  change.  And  there  is  no  way  you  can  maintain  all  of 
the  employment  that  goes  with  it  and  at  the  same  time  meet  debt 
obligations and handle that. 

In terms of the situation in St. Louis—I am sure that the Amer-
ican  executives  that  promised  that  there  would  be  more  inter-
national  service,  more  flying,  more  employment,  and  everything 
else,  meant  every  word  of  it.  I  am  sure  that  they  were  as  com-
mitted to it as Mr. Parker is. 

But,  it  is  a  volatile  industry,  and  there  are  changes  that  take 
place,  and  there  is  no  one  to  enforce  those—it  is  not  a  contract.  It 
is not something that is signed, that you can check on and enforce 
performance. So, at the end of the day, you can take their word for 
it, but circumstances will come along. And if you take a look at St. 
Louis  today,  they  have  60  percent  fewer  flights,  they  have  73  per-
cent  fewer  seats  in  that  market.  The  thought  that  LCCs  will  come 
in  has  not  proved  accurate,  because  Southwest  Airlines  has  re-
duced its flying by about 18 percent. 

So, while I hope that things work out with the runway, it is just 
an  indicator  of  the  kind  of  things—that  there  is  no  one  to  enforce. 
And  you  don’t  have  any  international  service,  in  Mexico  and  Can-
ada, except one flight a week to Puerto Vallarta. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  And  I  want  to  be  fair  to  American—I  do 
know that one of the reasons that the TWA folks got stapled at the 
bottom had to do with decisions within the various unions at Amer-
ican  at  the  time,  and  wasn’t  completely  within  the  control  of  the 
corporate structure. 

But saying that—I opened with my questions about the taxpayer 
money because, you know, I think—I don’t want to lose sight of the 
fact  that  we  had  a  national  catastrophe.  And  I  think  the  Federal 
Government  responded  to  do  what  was  necessary  to  help  this  in-
dustry because of that catastrophe. 

But  implicit  in  that,  I  think,  is  an  agreement  that  there  be  fair 
treatment  to  the  men  and  women  who  lost  their  jobs  as  a  result 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

75 

of  that  catastrophe.  And  I  worry  that  in,  in  some  of  the  decision-
making that’s going on—I understand the bottom line, and I under-
stand the need for profit. But, I think there have been so many ex-
amples  that  we  have  seen  in  corporate  America,  where  the  deci-
sions have not been as accommodating to the people at the middle 
and  the  bottom,  as  they  have  been  to  those  at  the  very,  very  top. 
You  know,  mediocre  CEOs  are  getting  hundreds  of  millions  of 
dollars.  Somebody  who’s  spent  40  years  of  their  lives  making  sure 
that the people who traveled on TWA were doing so safely, are out 
of  work.  And  meanwhile,  the  taxpayers  have  spent,  literally,  bil-
lions of dollars trying to bail out this industry. 

And, I just didn’t want this hearing to conclude without express-
ing  how  strongly  I  feel  that,  if  there  are  going  to  be  mergers— 
which I have a lot of trepidation about, based on Dr. Cooper’s testi-
mony and other readings I’ve done—I, for one, am going to be hol-
lering  about  these  people  and  their  security,  and  their  pensions, 
and  their  ability  to—and  there  is  no  reason  why—no  one,  I  don’t 
think  anyone  is  asking  that  the  TWA  employees  be  put  back  to 
work.  I  think  what  they’re  saying  is,  I  think,  that  they’re  willing 
to make concessions. I think what they’re saying is, to wait out our 
recall  rights—under  the  circumstances  of  hundreds  of  millions  of 
dollars of taxpayer money flowing to that airline—to wait them out, 
to me, just seems fundamentally unfair. 

Yes, Mr. Roach? 
Mr. ROACH. Yes, I’m a TWA employee. These two gentlemen over 
here  are  former  TWA  employees  out  of  St.  Louis.  And  what  hap-
pened  to  TWA  is  that—is  the  same  thing  that  could  happen  here, 
with  US  Airways  and  Delta.  The  fact  the  transition  was  not  com-
pleted  when  they  took  TWA  over,  the  fact  that  the  seniority  issue 
was  not  resolved,  and  it  was  left  to  a  political  process  rather  than 
a  business  process—all  of  those  TWA  people  went  to  the  bottom. 
I  don’t  really  have  much  to  say,  I,  people  have  been  asking  all 
of  these—I’m  the  employee  representative  here.  And  the  fact  re-
mains,  you  can’t  take  10,000  people,  and  say  you’re  going  to  float 
around  the  airports  until  you  decide  to  retire.  What  we  are  pro-
posing  to  America  West  and  US  Airways  is  that,  we  guarantee 
work.  We  bring  work  in-house,  similar  to  what  American  is  doing, 
through  efficiency  process,  bring  money  to  the  bottom  line,  those 
people will have something to do. 

So,  there  are  a  lot  of  things  that  have  to  happen  here.  And,  to 
be  quite  frank,  an  experienced  team—and  that’s  why  we’re  trying 
to work with Mr. Parker, on US Airways/America West, to give him 
that  experience—because  some  of  things  that  he’s  said  are  well- 
meaning,  are  not  plausible  in  the  real  world.  I’ve  been  in  this  in-
dustry  30  years.  We  could  work  with  him,  but  he’d  have  to  finish 
this transaction first. 

You see, you can’t have Delta Airline employees with one pension 
plan,  and  US  Airways  with  another  pension  plan—the  law  don’t 
allow  it.  We  have  to  have  a  transition  agreement,  we  have  to  put 
all of those things together. 

We’re  trying  to  resolve  those  issues,  right  now.  Yes,  this  very 
panel. I was at the doctor’s office yesterday, a lady pulled up to me, 
she  said,  ‘‘I’m  from  TWA,  I  lost  my  job,  I  had  to  go  back  to  school 
and relocate,’’ Jerry Mitchell. She said, ‘‘Give them my phone num-

76 

ber  if  you  want  me  to  call  them.’’  These  transactions  are  very  dif-
ficult.  The  process  is  very  difficult.  And  as  well-meaning  as  people 
might be, they just don’t come easy. 

And  therefore—I’m  going  to  say  it  again—you’ve  got  to  finish 
transaction  one,  before  you  go  to  transaction  two.  You  cannot  put 
together  a  maintenance  program—when  you  don’t  have  a  mainte-
nance program at US Airways, you cannot put a maintenance pro-
gram in again at Delta Air Lines. It is impossible. 

We’re  willing  to  work  with  them,  we’ve  got  a  proposal  on  the 
table  to  resolve  those  issues.  And  if  you  can’t  resolve  those  issues 
on  US  Airways  and  America  West,  you  damn  sure  can’t—excuse 
my language—resolve them on Delta Air Lines. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Your language is excused. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Roach. 
Thank you all, very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much, Senator McCaskill. 
I  have  two  things  to  say:  Number  one,  is  that  I  think  this  has 
been a really, really useful hearing. And, one of the things that has 
happened to me during the course of it is that I have sort of taken 
on  another  iteration.  And  that  is  the  health  of—that  America  is 
fair. We may or may not be, should be in Iraq—that’s for everybody 
to  decide.  But,  we  have  a  fair  system.  Little  states  have  two  Sen-
ators, huge states have two Senators—it makes no difference, we’re 
based  upon  equality.  We  don’t  live  up  to  it  always,  but  that  is  our 
standard. 

And,  what  strikes  me  is  that,  in  the  automobile  industry,  Gen-
eral  Motors  never  paid  any  attention,  until  Toyota  and  Nissan 
came into Southern California and had a friendly air pollution-con-
trol  district  in  that  area,  and  then  10  years  later,  General  Motors 
began  to  pay  a  little  bit  of  attention.  You  don’t  have  that.  You 
don’t—you  have  foreign  competition,  but  you  don’t  have  foreign 
competition for little places. 

Therefore, I am very intrigued, Secretary Steinberg, by your com-
ing  workload.  And  that  is  to  try  and  find  a  way  which  does—and 
only the silliest person could say that this invalidates the American 
culture,  corporate  culture  or  otherwise—it’s  simply  trying  to  solve 
a  problem  for  people  who  need  a  problem  solved.  Amongst  whom 
are  many  absolutely  brilliant  entrepreneurs,  if  they  were  given  a 
chance. Or even if they’re not. 

So,  I  want  this  to  be—this  has  been  a  very  long  hearing,  and  I 
apologize  to  all  of  those  who  have  had  to  stand,  and  those  who’ve 
squiggled  and  wormed,  squirmed  and  all  of  the  rest  of  it—I  don’t 
care.  It’s  been  a  really  good  hearing.  And  we  have  a  new  concept 
on  the  table  here:  How  can  we  be  fair;  and  genuinely  be  fair,  to 
small communities? 

And  the  small  communities  are  not  to  be  categorized  as  the  dis-
advantaged. They’re not to be categorized as some attention deficit 
disorder  group  of  people—they  deserve  our  help,  and  I,  as  Chair-
man of this Committee, am determined to deliver it to them. 

So that, we have agreed, Secretary Steinberg, that you, my staff, 
and  others—and  I  assume  the  help  of  Mr.  Grinstein,  and  Mr. 
Parker,  Dr.  Cooper,  you,  sir—that  we  are  going  to  figure  out  some

way  to  try  and  make  this  work.  Let  us  not  fall  down  on  the  angst 
that’s  been  caused  by  the  word  regulation  or  re-regulation.  That’s 
stupid. We’re above that. 

My  announcement,  finally,  is  that  the  next  meeting  of  the  Com-
merce  Committee  will  be  at  2:30  on  January  31  for  an  Executive 
Session  to  consider  the  Committee’s  budget  resolution—you  won’t 
want to miss that.

Chairman Inouye, thank you for scheduling our hearing today on the state of the 
airline industry and the potential impact of airline industry mergers and consolida-
tion. I would also like to thank our witnesses for their participation. 

Since  Congress  passed  the  Airline  Deregulation  Act  in  1978,  the  airline  industry 
has  experienced  its  fair  share  of  mergers,  acquisitions,  liquidations,  and  consolida-
tion.  The  face  of  the  airline  industry  is  always  evolving  and  the  free  market  has 
proven to be beneficial to the airline industry and the flying public. 

The  airline  industry  is  still  in  a  time  of  transition,  and  is  re-making  itself  in  the 
aftermath  of  the  September  11th  attacks.  We  have  seen  a  number  of  bankruptcies, 
but  the  overall  health  of  the  airline  industry  seems  to  be  improving  as  tough  re-
structuring  plans  are  completed  and  implemented.  The  line  between  the  low-cost 
carriers and the legacy carriers draws closer each day. 

Today,  I  am  hopeful  the  Committee  does  not  get  bogged  down  in  the  details  of 
one  proposed  merger,  but  looks  at  the  overall  health  of  the  airline  industry  as  we 
move forward. 

Congress created a merger process, and if a large-scale airline merger is proposed, 
I  expect  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Department  of  Transportation  to  thor-
oughly  review  the  implications.  Congress  should  be  hesitant  to  get  involved  in  any 
one merger. 

I  remain  open  to  the  idea  of  airline  consolidation,  if  it  leads  to  an  improved  eco-
nomic  health  of  the  industry.  If  a  merger  makes  business  sense  for  the  companies 
and the traveling public is not adversely impacted, I don’t see why Congress should 
get involved. 

I welcome our witnesses and look forward to the testimony. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

The  viability  of  the  airline  industry  has  been  as  issue  as  long  as  I  have  been  in 
Congress.  One  hundred  and  sixty  two  carriers  have  filed  for  bankruptcy  since  de-
regulation in 1978, which means that nearly every major airline has filed for bank-
ruptcy at some point and some more than once. 

The  airline  industry  lost  more  than  $30  billion  between  2001  and  2005,  with  the 
legacy  airlines  accounting  for  more  than  $28  billion  of  these  losses.  These  losses 
came  about  despite  Congress  providing  $5  billion  in  direct  compensation  to  the  air-
lines, $10 billion in loan guarantees, insurance aid, pension assistance, and liability 
protection. 

There  has  been  a  bit  of  good  news  recently  for  the  large  carriers.  Several  legacy 
carriers  posted  profits  in  2006  for  the  first  time  in  5  years,  while  several  low-cost 
carriers  did  not.  This  led  the  Wall  Street  Journal  to  write  a  headline  that  was  un-
thinkable just a year ago: ‘‘Legacy Airlines may Outfly Discount Rivals.’’ Airline an-
alysts  expect  the  industry  to  earn  about  $1.1  billion  in  2006,  which  would  be  the 
first industry profit since 2000, and earn a record profit in 2007 of $6.1 billion. 

Today  we  meet  to  review  the  most  recent  proposed  consolidations  of  US  Airways 
and  Delta,  and  AirTran  and  MidWest  Airlines.  Some  believe  consolidation  is  nec-
essary  to  maintain  the  health  of  the  industry,  while  others  believe  such  consolida-
tion  may  reduce  competition  and  harm  consumers.  If  history  provides  any  insight, 
markets  have  generally  become  more  competitive  as  the  industry  consolidates.  Ac-
cording  a  2005  GAO  report,  the  average  number  of  competitors  increased  from  2.2 
per market in 1980 to 3.5 in 2005. 

It  is  important  to  remember,  however,  that  history  is  not  the  determining  factor. 
The  Department  of  Justice  will  perform  a  thorough  antitrust  review.  The  Depart-
ment has scrutinized numerous airline mergers and consolidations, and I respect its 
role in the review process and look forward to the Department’s findings.

The  current  condition  of  the  industry  and  its  future  prospects  are  of  paramount 
concern.  There  is  no  dispute  about  the  importance  of  aviation  to  our  national  econ-
omy and I hope Congress can continue to work with the industry to ensure a robust 
national air transportation system. 

I  thank  our  witnesses  for  being  here  and  hope  they  will  be  able  to  shed  light  on 

what the future holds for the industry. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

I  am  pleased  that  the  Committee  is  having  this  hearing  today  to  look  at  the  eco-
nomic health of the airline industry. As we all know, the airlines have gone through 
some  very  difficult  times  since  9/11.  Many  of  them  have  been  through  bankruptcy 
and very painful restructuring. 

But recently things seem to be improving. Carriers are emerging from bankruptcy 
and  some  are  even  making  money.  So  it  is  very  appropriate  for  this  Committee  to 
get an update on the financial state of the industry. We want to know if things are 
truly  getting  better  and  if  the  industry  has  turned  the  corner,  or  if  this  is  just  a 
temporary  situation.  We  also  should  discuss  what,  if  any,  public  policy  changes  we 
should  consider  to  improve  the  health  of  the  industry.  Since  we  have  a  major  avia-
tion reauthorization bill this year that we need to pass, this is a very timely discus-
sion. 

There will also be lots of discussion today about possible mergers between various 
airlines.  I  hope  we  don’t  get  too  caught  up  in  debating  the  pros  and  cons  on  any 
particular merger and lose sight of the big picture. 

I  have  to  say  that  I  generally  don’t  see  anything  wrong  with  mergers.  If  the  pri-
vate  markets  decide  that  it  makes  financial  and  economic  sense  to  merge  one  or 
more  companies,  I  am  not  sure  that  Government  should  second  guess  such  a  deci-
sion. In my view, there eventually will be mergers in the airlines industry and there 
probably should be. As we have seen, the current size and structure of the industry 
has  resulted  in  massive  losses  over  the  last  years  with  devastating  effects  on  em-
ployees. So maybe we should let some of these companies merge and see what hap-
pens. Could it actually get worse? 

Of  course,  I  am  not  sure  that  the  merger  between  US  Air  and  Delta  is  the  best 
possible  combination.  There  may  be  other  combinations  that  may  make  sense  from 
a financial or industry perspective. 

Finally,  Congress  has  set  up  a  process  as  the  Department  of  Justice  and  at  the 
Department  of  Transportation  to  review  mergers.  If  we  get  to  the  point  were  this 
merger goes forward, then that process should run its course. I don’t think Congress 
should intervene legislatively while the merger is under review. 

I look forward to hearing from the witnesses. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 
Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  other  Members  of  the  Committee, 
thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing  today.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  our  witnesses 
for  taking  time  out  of  their  busy  schedules  to  testify  before  our  Committee  today. 
Air travel is vital to our Nation’s economy and the airline industry is at an impor-
tant  point  in  its  history.  The  industry  is  recovering  and  moving  past  pre-9/11  high 
marks  in  terms  of  passengers  and  other  metrics.  Many  of  the  legacy  carriers  have 
gone  through  bankruptcy  and  reworked  their  debt  and  their  overhead  costs.  Many 
observers are hoping our airlines will soon start running in the black. How the air-
line industry reacts to market pressures, along with how Congress and the Federal 
regulatory agencies treat the airline industry, could have consequences on air travel 
into  the  next  generation.  This  means  we  all  better  get  it  right.  It  is  my  hope  that 
the  airlines,  along  with  the  government  regulators  can  strike  the  balance  between 
the  need  for  efficiencies  and  the  need  for  competition.  Air  travelers  will  win  if  the 
airline  industry  has  the  right  balance  of  scale  efficiencies  and  healthy  competition. 
I hope we can get there.

CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES 

Washington, DC, January 23, 2007 

Hon. JAMES OBERSTAR, 
Chair, 
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
Hon. PETER F. COSTELLO, 
Chair, 
House Subcommittee on Aviation, 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Costello: 

Please  accept  our  belated  congratulations  on  your  new  positions.  We  write  to  ex-
press  our  strong  support  for  your  plans  to  conduct  hearings  on  airline  consolida-
tion’s effect on American workers and travelers. 

Given  the  recent  increase  in  airline  mergers,  we  feel  that  it  is  timely  for  a  com-
prehensive  assessment  of  airline  mergers  and  its  affect  on  communities  across  the 
Nation.  As  you  know,  the  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transpor-
tation plans a public review of this issue tomorrow. 

Two  weeks  ago,  US  Airways  increased  its  hostile  takeover  bid  to  $10.2  billion  in 
its  attempt  to  acquire  Delta  Air  Lines.  If  successful,  this  merger  would  create  the 
world’s  largest  airline.  Our  constituents  have  expressed  concerns  that  the  proposed 
union could result in significant job loss, fewer seats, and higher ticket prices. 

Delta  currently  employs  about  50,000  people  nationwide  more  than  half  of  whom 
are  employed  in  the  Atlanta  area.  As  a  result  of  the  merger,  3,000  jobs  will  be  lost 
in  the  Atlanta  headquarters  and  an  additional  2,200  positions  in  the  region.  The 
proposed  10  percent  capacity  reduction  of  a  merged  Delta-US  Airways  could  also 
lead to the loss of thousands of jobs across the country. 

The two carriers’ overlapping flight routes further impress the national impact of 
airline  mergers.  Many  are  concerned  that  in  25  eastern  and  southern  airports,  the 
combined Delta and US Airways would become the dominant carrier, carrying more 
than  half  of  the  capacity  at  the  airport.  The  negative  impact  on  these  airports  and 
the communities and passengers they serve could be disproportionately high. For ex-
ample,  airline  travelers  could  witness  reductions  in  flight  options  and  increases  in 
airfare prices. 

Finally, we would like to underscore the need for Congressional investigation and 
oversight  on  the  history  of  airline  mergers  and  bankruptcy  from  the  perspective  of 
the average airline employee. In the case of Delta, a loyal and determined workforce 
of  mechanics,  flight  attendants,  pilots,  reservation  clerks,  ground  crews,  and  others 
have sacrificed a lot, including cuts in wages and pensions, to keep Delta operating 
and  help  its  emergence  from  bankruptcy.  US  Airways  is  currently  working  to  ad-
dress  its  current  America  West  merger  problems  that  include  numerous  computer 
and  service  complications,  multiple  un-integrated  labor  contracts,  and  a  variety  of 
complaints from current employees about issues of seniority, pay, and benefits. The 
morale  and  economic  impact  of  the  airline  consolidation  movement  on  these  hard-
working Americans should be a component of your investigations. 

A  robust  Congressional  review  of  how  the  Delta-US  Airways  and  other  industry 
mergers affect airline employees and air travelers around the country is much need-
ed. We appreciate your attention to this important issue. 

Sincerely, 

Members  of  Congress:  John  Lewis,  David  Scott,  John  Barrow,  Henry  C. 
‘‘Hank’’ Johnson, Jr., Sanford D. Bishop, and Jim Marshall.

GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

Via electronic transmission (January 23, 2007) 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Re:  Comments  on  proposed  US  Airways-Delta  Air  Lines  Merger  for  Committee’s 
January 24, 2007 Hearing To Examine the Potential Impact of Airline Merg-
ers and Industry Consolidation on the Airline Industry 

Dear Senator Inouye: 

I  am  writing  to  support  the  Committee’s  examination  of  the  potential  impact  of 
mergers  and  industry  consolidation  on  the  airline  industry.  My  Office  is  currently 
participating  in  a  multi-state  attorney  general  inquiry  into  the  antitrust  issues 
raised  by  the  proposed  US  Airways-Delta  Air  Lines  merger.  Although  our  inquiry 
has  not  been  completed  and  no  conclusion  has  been  reached  regarding  a  merger’s 
overall  effect  on  competition,  my  staff  has  identified  several  issues  that  may  help 
to focus the Committee’s work in this area: 
1. How Would a Merger Affect Competition at Major, Capacity-Constrained 

Airports, Like Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)? 

DCA is the airport of choice for many of those who visit the District of Columbia 
for  governmental  or  commercial  business.  Compared  to  other  area  airports,  DCA  is 
particularly  convenient  for  travelers  who  wish  to  leave  D.C.  during  the  late  after-
noon-to-evening rush hour period. 

In addition, DCA is a capacity-constrained airport with limited slots. US Airways 
operates approximately 47 percent of these slots and Delta Air Lines operates about 
another 14 percent. A combined US Airways/Delta Air Lines, with about 60 percent 
of the slots at DCA, may be able to exercise market power and charge an increased 
premium for selected categories of passengers flying to and from DCA, such as busi-
ness class passengers on certain routes. Another capacity-constrained airport where 
US  Airways  and  Delta  Air  Lines  together  operate  a  majority  of  the  slots  is  New 
York’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA). 
2.  How  Would  the  Merger  Affect  Competition  in  the  Provision  of  Shuttle 

Flights Between the Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston Areas? 

Currently, U.S. Airways and Delta Air Lines are the only airlines offering shuttle 
service between DCA and LGA. Absent divestiture of substantial shuttle operations 
to  a  strong  competitor,  a  combined  US  Airways/Delta  Air  Lines  would  dominate 
shuttle service between the Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston areas. Shuttle 
service  between  capacity-constrained  airports,  like  DCA,  LGA,  and  Boston’s  Logan 
International  Airport  (BOS),  would  seem  to  be  especially  vulnerable  to  exercises  of 
market  power  by  a  dominant  provider  because  potential  competitors  are  likely  to 
find it relatively difficult to introduce or expand service at these airports. 
3.  How  Would  the  Merger  Affect  Competition  in  the  Provision  of  Airline 
Service  Between  Areas  With  Hub  Airports,  Like  the  Washington,  D.C. 
Area, and Small Cities? 

A US Airways/Delta Air Lines merger could have a disproportionately adverse im-
pact  on  competition  in  the  provision  of  airline  service  between  major  metropolitan 
areas and small cities. 

Airlines  that  have  hub  operations  in  the  Washington,  D.C.  area—including  US 
Airways  and  Delta  Air  Lines  at  DCA,  and  United  Airlines  at  Washington  Dulles 
International  Airport  (IAD)—may  have  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  provision  of 
service to small cities. These airlines are able to offer flights to and from small cities 
that  serve:  (1)  to  connect  the  small  cities  to  the  Washington,  D.C.  area  as  a  point 
of  origin  or  destination;  and  (2)  to  connect  the  small  cities  to  other  cities,  using  a 
Washington,  D.C.-area  airport  as  a  hub.  In  many  cases,  it  may  be  the  availability 
of passengers who are using a Washington, D.C.-area airport only as a hub that al-
lows  an  airline  to  fill  the  large  planes  that  can  provide  economical  service  between 
the Washington, D.C. area and many small cities. 

If,  following  a  merger,  hub  operations  at  DCA  and  IAD  were  largely  controlled 
by  US  Airways/Delta  Air  Lines  and  United  Airlines,  these  airlines  could  have  the 
potential  to  dominate  service  between  the  Washington,  D.C.  area  and  small  cities. 
Competitors  lacking  a  hub-like  presence  in  the  area  may  find  it  difficult  or  impos-
sible to maintain competitive service on these routes, as illustrated by Independence 
Air’s  unsuccessful  effort  to  offer  many  flights  between  small  cities  and  IAD.  Since 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

83 

Independence  Air’s  exit  from  the  market  about  a  year  ago,  airfares  have  increased 
dramatically on many routes from IAD and DCA. 
4. How Would the Merger Affect Overall Trends in the Airline Industry? 

Because  US  Airways  and  Delta  Air  Lines  operate  large,  overlapping  networks,  a 
merger would have the potential to affect competition with respect to numerous city 
pairs  over  a  large  portion  of  the  United  States.  On  routes  now  served  by  both  air-
lines,  adverse  competitive  effects  may  include  higher  ticket  prices  and  discontinu-
ation  of  currently  scheduled  flights.  In  addition,  a  merger  of  this  size  could  rapidly 
trigger ‘‘defensive mergers’’ by other major airlines, leading to what Kevin Mitchell, 
the Chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, warns could be the ‘‘ ‘tsunami’ of air-
line  industry  consolidation  most  feared  by  business  travel  advocates.’’  (quoted  by 
CNNMoney.com,  Dec.  13,  2006,  http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/13/news/compa-
nies/airlineslmergers/index.htm). 
Conclusion 

Any anti-competitive effects of a merger of US Airways and Delta Air Lines would 
have the potential to increase prices and reduce service for many routes serving the 
Washington,  D.C.  area,  as  well  as  for  many  more  routes  serving  other  areas  of  the 
country. In addition, such a merger could trigger a series of defensive mergers lead-
ing to much greater industry consolidation in a relatively short period of time. 

Thank you for the opportunity to share with you some of the issues that we have 
identified in the course of our inquiry. Should your Committee hold further hearings 
on  the  issue  of  airline  industry  consolidation,  the  state  attorneys  general  partici-
pating  in  this  multi-state  effort—as  well  as  those  participating  in  the  broader  Air-
line  Working  Group  of  state  attorneys  general—would  welcome  the  opportunity  to 
present further information and analysis for your consideration. 

Acting Attorney General for the District of Columbia 

LINDA SINGER, 

Any requests from the Committee’s staff regarding this matter should be directed 

to Senior Assistant Attorney General Don A. Resnikoff. 

Very truly yours, 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT MECHANICS FRATERNAL ASSOCIATION 

I am Stephen MacFarlane, Assistant National Director for the Aircraft Mechanics 
Fraternal Association (AMFA), a craft union representing nearly 9,700 aviation me-
chanics  and  related  employees  at  United,  Alaska,  Southwest,  Northwest,  Mesaba, 
Horizon,  and  ATA.  I  am  writing  to  share  my  organization’s  concerns  regarding 
mergers  and  consolidation  within  the  airline  industry.  We  understand  that  consoli-
dation within the industry is likely, and we are not necessarily opposed to consolida-
tion per se, however, AMFA believes there are facts that Congress should take into 
consideration regarding any proposed merger. 

Having endured devastating job losses and drastic reductions in pay and benefits 
coerced from airline workers throughout the industry over the past 5 years, we can’t 
help  but  flinch  at  the  prospect  of  another  corporate  tactic  that  has  the  potential  of 
delivering yet another blow to the livelihoods of airline workers. 

The  government  has  already  provided  great  assistance  to  the  airline  industry  in 
the  form  of  the  ATSB,  where  $5B  in  taxpayer  dollars  was  given  to  the  industry 
without any guidance as to how the airlines were to spend the money. Another $10B 
was  made  available  for  loans  to  assist  the  ailing  industry.  While  this  is  laudable, 
no  help  was  forthcoming  to  the  tens  of  thousands  of  workers  who  lost  their  jobs  as 
a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 

Additionally,  Federal  bankruptcy  laws,  never  intended  to  be  used  as  a  strategic 
tool  for  competitive  purposes,  were  turned  against  workers  as  Federal  judges  aided 
executive  management  teams  in  extracting  severe,  painful,  and  permanent  conces-
sions from American airline workers. 

During mergers of airlines in the 1970s and 1980s the government recognized the 
peril  to  workers  that  mergers  presented  and  insured  that  workers  were  not  abused 
by  these  business  transactions.  In  1972,  with  the  merger  of  Allegheny  Airlines  and 
Mohawk  Airlines,  Labor  Protective  Provisions  (LPP’s)  were  established  to  prevent 
corporations  from  using  mergers  as  a  means  to  circumvent  labor  contracts.  In  light 
of  the  devastation  delivered  to  tens  of  thousands  of  airline  workers  in  the  form  of 
terminated pensions, twenty-five percent and greater pay reductions, increased med-
ical premiums, and permanent job losses it would be proper for the 110th Congress 
to  once  again  enact  these  protections  so  that  airline  workers  are  not  unnecessarily

placed  in  peril  at  the  hands  of  another  government-sanctioned  industry  consolida-
tion. 

Sections 3 and 13 of the LPP’s set out the criteria for merging carriers’ workforces 
and the time-frame in which to accomplish this oftentimes difficult task. The provi-
sions  ensure,  rightly,  the  maintaining  of  seniority  lists  and  collective  bargaining 
agreements for employee groups, as well as spelling out a framework for arbitration 
in  the  event  that  the  merging  of  workforces  does  not  go  smoothly.  As  the  US  Air/ 
AmericaWest  situation  shows  us,  the  need  for  a  concrete  time-frame  in  these  mat-
ters  is  imperative,  as  the  merged  carrier  remains  without  a  maintenance  program 
and  a  collectively  bargained  agreement  for  its  yet-to-be-merged  workforce.  Further-
more,  if  as  Mr.  Parker  claims,  there  would  be  no  employee  furloughs  or  layoffs,  it 
follows that the LPP’s should be enacted for the simple reason that they are appar-
ently benign in this situation. 

Mr.  Chairman,  we  acknowledge  the  value  and  benefit  of  having  a  viable  airline 
industry  that  provides  great  mobility  and  swift  commerce  for  our  nation,  however, 
the  other  part  of  the  equation  is  a  stable  and  productive  middle-class  that  contrib-
utes to the economic vibrance and tax base of the American economy. Labor Protec-
tive Provisions must be a part of any mergers that are approved by the Federal Gov-
ernment to ensure a balance of power exists between workers and corporations. 

Airline  workers  are  already  smarting  from  the  last  bus  that  ran  us  over,  please 

do not give the corporations another green light to mow us down once again. 

Having worked in the airline industry for twenty-five years and lived through two 
mergers,  Hughes  Airwest/Republic  and  Republic/Northwest,  I  can  attest  first-hand 
to  the  harm  that  can  befall  workers  caught  up  in  airline  mergers.  If  you  have  any 
questions or concerns that I might address please contact me. 

Thank you. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD P. FABERMAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

AIR CARRIER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA 

Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  as  Executive  Director  of  the  Air 
Carrier  Association  of  America  (ACAA),  an  organization  that  represents  low-fare/ 
high-service  carriers  and  the  communities  they  serve,  I  am  very  happy  to  provide 
comments on the effect of mergers and consolidation on this industry. 

This hearing comes at a time when extremely limited competition exists in many 
of  the  Nation’s  largest  airports  and  markets.  As  a  result,  low-fare  carriers  are 
blocked  from  providing  low  fares  and  travel  options  for  many  American  travelers. 
It is of utmost importance that we take steps to bring back the benefits of competi-
tive  markets,  including  airfare  and  air  carrier  choices  for  Americans  who  rely  on 
those options for business, leisure, and last-minute travel. 
ACAA Members Provide Benefits to Consumers and Communities 

Our  air  carrier  members  operate  thousands  of  daily  flights  to  approximately  150 
destinations.  Their  traffic  is  growing  at  a  rate  of  about  twenty  percent  (20  percent) 
per  year.  These  carriers  serve  large,  medium,  and  small  hubs  and  have  various 
focus cities which include small communities. They offer full-size jet service in most 
of  these  markets.  By  introducing  flights  in  small  communities  and  creating  focus 
markets, these carriers connect those cities to leisure and business markets, as they 
have done at Akron-Canton Airport, Newport News/Williamsburg International Air-
port,  Southwest  Florida  International  Airport,  Atlantic  City  International  Airport, 
Wichita Mid-Continent Airport, Billings Logan International Airport, and Cheyenne 
Airport.  Once  initial  entry  into  a  market  is  made,  the  carrier  can  expand  beyond 
the  traditional  business  routes  by  adding  additional  service  to  other  destinations. 
This  results  in  substantial  benefits  to  the  local  airport  and  the  entire  region  it 
serves.  In  the  previously  mentioned  markets  and  others,  our  member  carriers  have 
significantly  expanded  passenger  numbers  and  brought  millions  of  dollars  in  cus-
tomer  savings  and  economic  growth.  They  want  to  expand  more  in  all  markets!  To 
continue to add all size communities to their route systems, these carriers must ob-
tain  additional  access  to  major  business  markets  such  as  LaGuardia  Airport  (LGA) 
and  Ronald  Reagan  Washington  National  Airport  (DCA),  two  markets  currently 
closed  to  expansion.  Therefore,  we  continue  to  push  for  open  markets  consistent 
with  deregulation.  If  consumer  benefits  are  to  exist,  it  is  essential  that  the  govern-
ment expand competitive options on a day-to-day basis, particularly as the industry 
experiences further mergers and consolidation.

Mergers and Consolidation 

85 

Since  the  birth  of  deregulation,  the  industry  has  experienced  examples  of  airline 
consolidation and mergers and has seen dozens of airlines terminate operations. The 
industry  and  the  U.S.  economy  will  only  remain  healthy  if  real  competition  is  al-
lowed  to  flourish.  Unfortunately,  real  competition  is  currently  blocked  at  many  of 
the  Nation’s  airports.  At  these  airports,  mergers  could  worsen  the  situation  by  giv-
ing the newly merged airline even greater market and airport dominance. Although 
we must be cautious about mergers and consolidation, they can also offer opportuni-
ties to improve competition and benefit the industry—as long as the government de-
mands spin-offs from the merging carriers to promote competition. In the past, con-
solidation  or  bankruptcy  has  opened  the  door  to  new  competitive  opportunities.  In 
order  to  ensure  that  competition  does  not  disappear,  merging  airlines  must  be  re-
quired  to  spin-off  assets  that  would  otherwise  increase  their  market  control.  In  the 
past,  the  Department  of  Justice  has  required  dominant  merging  carriers  to  divest 
certain assets including gates, airport facilities and access to airports. It is expected 
and  important  to  require  the  merging  carriers  to  give  up  some  of  their  assets.  By 
redistributing such resources to limited incumbents and new entrants, mergers can 
actually improve competition and help build a healthier industry. 

It  is  therefore  essential  that  Congress  not  only  require  government  agencies  to 
fulfill  their  responsibilities  in  promoting  competition  on  a  regular  basis,  but  also 
send a message that mergers between dominant carriers will occur only if consider-
able assets are made available to other carriers. It is absolutely crucial that the in-
dustry  have  significant  competition  to  survive  and  thrive,  but  this  is  not  possible 
when  only  a  few  carriers  control  the  Nation’s  airports.  When  proposed  mergers  are 
on  the  table,  the  highest  priority  must  be  to  guarantee  that  they  will  not  further 
limit competition. If implemented carefully and with an eye toward improving com-
petition, mergers can have positive impacts on the competitive state of the industry 
and can improve travel options for air travelers. 

Consumer  choice  and  travel  options  at  individual  airports  and  within  the  entire 
industry must be preserved. Consolidation is inevitable, but the industry must take 
immediate  steps  to  provide  opportunities  for  competition.  LGA  is  one  airport  se-
verely  lacking  in  travel  options  because  access  by  new  entrants  is  blocked  by  gov-
ernment  regulations.  At  LGA,  new  carriers  are  only  allowed  to  operate  ten 
roundtrips,  while  legacy  carriers  at  the  same  airport  have  hundreds  of  arrival  and 
departure authorizations. At DCA the situation is equally extreme—AirTran, Spirit 
and  Frontier  only  have  a  few  roundtrips,  while  the  legacy  carriers  dominate  with 
hundreds  of  flights.  The  current  regulations  have  not  been  modified  to  reflect 
changes  in  the  industry  and  this  has  resulted  in  some  very  closed  airports,  many 
of which have absolutely no opportunities for new entry. If the Nation’s largest car-
riers  are  allowed  to  merge,  steps  must  be  taken  to  preserve  competition.  Without 
such steps, mergers could force out limited incumbents and new entrants and some 
markets could lose all service or be blocked from obtaining low-fare service options. 
For  these  reasons,  the  US  Airways/Delta  merger  must  be  put  on  hold  until  the 
carriers  demonstrate  how  they  will  spin-off  assets  to  ensure  that  competition  ex-
pands and is not further limited. 
Conclusion 

Even without adding the complication of mergers or consolidation, the government 
should  be  continuously  taking  action  to  promote  competition.  Unfortunately,  this 
has  not  happened,  so  with  mergers  on  the  table,  it  is  now  even  more  important  to 
make  changes  that  foster  a  strong  airline  industry.  Taking  significant  assets  from 
the merging airlines and redistributing them to low-cost carriers will provide travel 
options  and  consumer  benefits.  In  its  review  of  access  to  closed  airports,  DOT/FAA 
have complete legislative authority to implement control access and airport facilities 
changes at airports. 1 

1 The  Congestion  Management  Rule  for  LaGuardia  Airport  NPRM,  specifically  highlights  its 
ability to allocate departure and arrival authorities at restricted airports to promote competition 
by emphasizing that the Secretary of Transportation is required to consider objectives that fur-
ther  the  public  interest,  including:  Keeping  available  a  variety  of  adequate,  economic,  efficient, 
and  low-priced  air  services;  placing  maximum  reliance  on  competitive  market  forces  and  on  ac-
tual  and  potential  competition;  avoiding  airline  industry  conditions  that  would  tend  to  allow  at 
least  one  air  carrier  unreasonably  to  increase  prices,  reduce  services,  or  exclude  competition  in 
air transportation; encouraging, developing, and maintaining an air transportation system rely-
ing  on  actual  and  potential  competition;  encouraging  entry  into  air  transportation  markets  by 
new  and  existing  air  carriers  and  the  continued  strengthening  of  small  air  carriers  to  ensure 
a more effective and competitive airline industry; maintaining a complete and convenient system 
of  scheduled  air  transportation  for  small  communities;  ensuring  that  consumers  in  all  regions

It  is  time  to  send  a  message  to  legacy  carriers  that  competition  in  this  country 
will  be  protected  and  that  ‘‘Open  Kkies’’  is  a  goal  for  the  United  States  and  not 
merely  for  international  destinations.  Therefore,  while  mergers  are  underway,  the 
industry  must  at  the  same  time  make  changes  freeing  up  airport  facilities  for  lim-
ited incumbents that operate full-size jets. 

The choice is to either allow legacy carriers to continue to dominate markets and 
close doors to competition or to give all consumers true choices. The American public 
wants choices. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  and  the  Committee  for  addressing  this  important 
issue.  This  Committee  has  in  the  past  been  instrumental  in  promoting  competitive 
options.  Without  improved  access  and  a  more  competitive  industry,  the  traveling 
public  will  not  have  the  fares  and  options  necessary  for  business,  leisure,  and  last- 
minute travel. The merger discussions cannot be considered unless the dream of de-
regulation and true competition for all is fully addressed. 

AMERICAN SOCIETY OF TRAVEL AGENTS 

Alexandria, VA, January 23, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 

The  American  Society  of  Travel  Agents  (ASTA)  supports  your  leadership  action 
in  conducting  a  January  24  hearing  on  the  potential  impact  of  airline  mergers  and 
industry  consolidation  within  the  U.S.  airline  industry.  At  present,  while  ASTA  is 
reserving judgment regarding particular airline combinations, we remain vigilant of 
the  grave  consequences  further  industry  consolidation  will  have  on  the  Nation’s  air 
transportation system. 

The threat to competition from airline combinations is extremely serious as it per-
tains to both consumers and travel sellers. Congress and the Department of Justice 
should  apply  the  highest  standards  of  scrutiny  to  any  proposals  for  mergers  or  ac-
quisitions  among  major  carriers.  There  is  no  hard  evidence  that  for  sustained  peri-
ods airline mergers have reduced costs or produced efficiencies that benefit the trav-
eling public. 

Historically airlines have used brute market power to shift costs to consumers and 
travel agents, thus lightening the cost load on their books. These cost shifts are not 
evidence of efficiencies attributable to consolidation but are a means to disguise the 
carriers’ inability to discard ineffective models of operation. 

As the number of major carriers decreases, the airline industry will ultimately see 
each  other  as  more  similar  than  as  different  in  the  way  that  Southwest  Airlines, 
for example, remains different in today’s marketplace. In such circumstances, there 
is no doubt that the industry’s behavior will likely be more parallel rather than com-
petitive  in  nature.  Congress  cannot  count  on  Southwest  Airlines  and  JetBlue  to 
maintain competitive vitality in the national carrier industry. 

Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  crucial  that  the  U.S.  air  transportation  system  continue  to 
maintain its competitiveness, which results in better service and lower fares for con-
sumers.  ASTA  thanks  you  again  for  conducting  this  extremely  important  hearing. 

Sincerely, 

CHERYL COREY HUDAK, CTC 

President.

87 

My name is Captain Lee Moak, and I am the Chairman of the Delta Master Exec-
utive  Council  of  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association  (ALPA),  the  union  that  represents 
the 6,500 pilots of Delta Air Lines. I am an international 767 captain and a 19-year 
employee  of  Delta  Air  Lines.  Prior  to  my  career  at  Delta,  I  served  this  Nation  as 
a  United  States  Marine  Corps  fighter  pilot,  and  as  I  joined  Delta,  I  transitioned  to 
the  Naval  Air  Reserve  Force  to  finish  my  military  career  as  a  U.S.  Navy  fighter 
pilot. 

I mention my military credentials because as I continue, I want to emphasize that 
I  am  proud  of  my  service  which  included  the  defense  of  our  American  way  of  life 
including a free market economy. But our Nation’s aviation industry is unique, and 
careful government scrutiny and oversight must ensure that any potential industry 
consolidation is in the best interests of the traveling public. 

On  November  15,  2006,  US  Airways  management  announced  an  unsolicited  hos-
tile  proposal  whereby  US  Airways  would  takeover  Delta  Air  Lines  in  exchange  for 
US Airways stock and borrowed cash (debt). 

The employees of Delta Air Lines stand firmly united in our opposition to the US 

Airways hostile takeover of our company. 
Airline Industry Consolidation 

Many leading industry experts suggest, and we recognize, that eventually, indus-
try  consolidation  is  not  only  likely,  but  probable  and  perhaps  even  inevitable.  With 
that in mind, I want to make the following point: 

We support a free market solution that includes rational industry consolidation; 
consolidation  that  does  not  lead  to  reduced  service,  increased  fares  and  other 
problems for the industry’s constituents. 

In the future, sensible airline consolidation opportunities may occur. If faced with 
such  an  opportunity,  the  pilots  of  Delta  Air  Lines  are  interested  in  participating  in 
the  ‘‘right’’  consolidation  effort,  a  consensual  merger  with  a  rational  mix  of  routes, 
employees  and  resources,  and  with  the  absence  of  major  antitrust  and  other  detri-
mental  issues.  The  ‘‘right’’  merger  opportunity  could  draw  our  support  and  result 
in a successful merger that benefits everyone involved—the traveling public, the cor-
porations, the employees, and the communities we serve. 

The hostile attempt by US Airways to takeover Delta Air Lines is not that merg-

er. 

Instead, US Airway’s proposal is an opportunistic effort under this Nation’s bank-
ruptcy  laws  that  would  harm  the  traveling  public,  the  communities  we  serve,  and 
the  career  prospects  of  Delta,  America  West  and  US  Airways  employees.  As  such, 
the  Delta  pilots  and  all  Delta  employees  strongly  oppose  the  US  Airways  merger 
attempt  and  support  Delta  and  its  management’s  efforts  to  reorganize  as  a  stand- 
alone company. 
Background 

On  September  11,  2001,  terrorists  used  commercial  airliners  as  weapons  of  mass 
destruction  to  attack  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  events  changed  our  lives 
forever  and  also  marked  the  beginning  of  drastic  change  for  America’s  aviation  in-
dustry.  The  following  years  were  marked  by  record  industry  financial  losses,  sky-
rocketing  oil  prices,  increased  security  costs,  government-backed  loans  through  the 
Air  Transportation  Stabilization  Board  (ATSB),  and  numerous  airline  bankruptcies 
(including US Airways in bankruptcy twice) and even liquidations. 

Delta Air Lines was not immune from the pressures of the post-9/11 environment. 
The Delta pilots recognized the immensity of the challenges our company faced and 
in  December  2004,  the  Delta  pilots  reached  a  consensual  concessionary  agreement 
with Delta management valued at $5 billion which included a 32.5 percent pay cut. 
The agreement was designed to help Delta avoid Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
Despite  the  term  ‘‘protection,’’  we  knew  then  as  we  know  now  that  bankruptcy  is 
a horrible place to be, and we took the action we felt necessary to try and help our 
company avoid bankruptcy if at all possible. 

Unfortunately,  despite  our  enormous  concessions,  Delta  management  did  file  for 
protection  under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code  in  September  2005.  At 
the time, the industry was still hemorrhaging, and many familiar with the econom-
ics of the industry believed Delta might not survive. 

But  to  paraphrase  Mark  Twain,  the  reports  of  Delta’s  demise  were  greatly  exag-
gerated.  Delta  has  used  Chapter  11  to  reorganize,  a  reorganization  that  has  been 
fueled in large part by further substantial concessions from the Delta pilots and our 
fellow Delta employees. As a result, less than 18 months after Delta filed for Chap-
ter  11,  Delta  is  poised  to  emerge  from  bankruptcy  as  a  strong,  stand-alone  compet-
itor  in  today’s  dynamic  marketplace.  In  short,  Delta  has  used  the  Chapter  11  reor-

ganization  process  to  make  a  remarkable  financial  recovery  in  a  relatively  short 
time (United Airlines spent over 3 years in bankruptcy for example.) 

As employees of Delta Air Lines, we are looking forward to Delta’s exit from bank-
ruptcy,  an  exit  marked  not  by  a  merger  or  acquisition,  but  by  the  emergence  of  a 
new,  fiscally  healthy  and  competitively  strong  Delta—a  Delta  poised  for  long-term 
success. But with bankruptcy exit on the horizon, our company has now come under 
a hostile takeover attack from a competitor. Now that the hard work is almost com-
plete,  US  Airways  and  short-term  money  financiers  see  an  opportunity  to  profit 
from  Delta’s  restructuring  efforts  while  at  the  same  time  eliminating  a  major  com-
petitor. 

Delta  management  is  committed  to  exiting  bankruptcy  as  a  stand-alone  airline, 

and the employees of Delta Air Lines share that commitment. 
US Airways/Delta—the Perfect Storm 

The US Airways hostile takeover proposal is the wrong merger at the wrong time. 
A  widely  diverse  group  of  industry  analysts,  corporate,  labor  and  government  lead-
ers all agree that of all possible merger scenarios, US Airways and Delta is the sin-
gle  worst  possible  airline  combination.  The  proposal  is  the  ‘‘perfect  storm’’  of  every-
thing  that  can  go  wrong  with  an  airline  merger,  putting  at  risk  the  concerns  and 
choices  of  the  traveling  public,  the  communities  we  serve,  employees  and  even  the 
success of the corporation itself. Today, I want to address just four of the many con-
cerns and how they relate to airline employees: 

1. Antitrust Issues 
2. Operational Issues 
3. Labor Issues 
4. Financial Issues 

1. Antitrust Issues 

A  rational  airline  merger  would  ideally  consist  of  a  complementary  route  struc-
ture  that  expands  travel  opportunities  to  the  traveling  public  at  reduced  cost  while 
minimizing  route  overlap.  Synergies  would  not  come  at  the  expense  of  employees. 
Take,  for  example,  the  case  of  the  Delta/Western  merger  in  1986.  This  merger  is 
widely  viewed  as  one  of  the  most  successful  mergers  in  aviation  history.  Below  are 
pre-merger route maps of Delta and Western. Note the strength of Delta in the east 
and Western in the west. 

An overlay of these two pre-merger route maps demonstrates that with almost no 
overlap,  the  merger  allowed  the  combined  airline  to  realize  true  synergy  and  in-
creased  choice  for  the  traveling  public  while  minimizing  route  overlap,  redundant 
operations, and lost jobs.

The  route  overlap  is  staggering.  Competition  would  be  reduced  on  thousands  of 
city-pairs  across  the  Nation.  A  recent  independent  analysis 1 showed  that  the  pro-
posed takeover would result in: 

• A virtual monopoly on 159 major routes. 
• Overlap on 274 major routes. 
• A monopoly in seven cities where Delta and US Airways are now the only com-

petitors.

• More  than  50  percent  of  the  flights  in  key  airports  such  as  New  York’s 
LaGuardia  and  Washington’s  Reagan  National  airports  would  be  operated  by 
the merged airline. 

In  addition  to  the  virtual  certainty  of  fare  increases,  there  is  the  issue  of  jobs. 
US  Airways  management  claims  that  no  frontline  employee  jobs  will  be  lost  (never 
mind  that  ‘‘frontline’’  has  no  universal  definition),  but  this  is  simply  not  a  credible 
statement.  The  fact  is  that  their  plan  calls  for  ‘‘network  rationalization’’  including 
the  divestiture  of  one  of  the  two  Northeast  Shuttle  operations  and  at  least  a  10- 
percent  capacity  reduction.  US  Airways  management  has  also  indicated  on  numer-
ous  occasions  that  they  would  be  more  than  willing  to  divest  whatever  additional 
routes  and  assets  are  necessary  to  address  antitrust  concerns,  concerns  that  they 
claim do not exist in the first place. 

This  should  be  a  clear  indication  to  all  involved  that  the  US  Airways  proposal  is 
not  so  much  about  merging  as  it  is  about  misusing  the  bankruptcy  process  to  evis-
cerate  a  competitor.  With  divestitures  come  job  losses  and  the  proposed  combined 
route map speaks for itself. Despite claims by US Airways management, Delta esti-
mates that up to 10,000 jobs would be lost as a result of this merger and we concur 
with those estimates. 
2. Operational Issues 

Almost  2  years  ago,  America  West  merged  with  US  Airways,  a  bankrupt  airline 
that, unlike Delta, was failing—a rudderless ship foundering on the edge of liquida-
tion. US Airways was in its second bankruptcy in as many years, without a business 
plan,  without  a  management  team,  unable  to  capture  revenue  or  control  costs.  US 
Airways was at the mercy of the ATSB and its aircraft lessors, and they were going 
out  of  business.  Like  the  current  proposal,  many  promises  of  synergies  were  made. 
But  now  that  America  West  and  US  Airways  have  attempted  to  consummate  the 
merger, how has that worked out? 

• US Airways has failed to integrate facilities at most airports. 
• US Airways has failed to integrate their flight operations. 
• US Airways has failed to integrate their reservations systems. 
• US  Airways  has  failed  to  integrate  their  passenger’s  check-in  and  passenger 
• US Airways has failed to merge the seniority lists of their employees. 
Recently, my counterpart at US Airways, Captain Jack Stephan, issued this state-

handling operations. 

ment: 

‘‘Although  they  have  had  ample  time  and  opportunity,  US  Airways  hasn’t  yet 
merged  US  Airways  and  America  West,  and  they  have  not  integrated  the  pilot 
groups  under  one  contract.  I  don’t  expect  that  they  will  be  capable  of  merging 
a third airline into the fold.’’ 

And my counterpart at America West, Captain John McIlvenna, added: 

‘‘[US  Airways]  Management  cannot  successfully  merge  without  labor  on 
board. . . . US  Airways,  despite  its  statements  to  its  investors  and  the  finan-
cial community, has not completed the business of integrating US Airways and 
America West. This failure calls into question their ability to successfully merge 
three  airlines,  continue  to  serve  their  passengers,  deliver  dividends  to  their  in-
vestors, and maintain a motivated employee base.’’ 

Post-merger  labor  integration  is  a  mess.  In  fact,  in  less  than  2  weeks,  at  Reagan 
National  Airport  just  a  short  distance  away,  the  US  Airways  pilots  led  by  their 
union’s  Strike  Preparation  Committee  will  conduct  picketing  operations  with  the 
theme  ‘‘We  are  at  war,’’  as  they  escalate  their  fight  for  a  fair  single  contract  under 
Doug Parker’s definition of a successful merger. 

The  bottom  line?  Despite  public  claims  to  the  contrary,  the  US  Airways/America 
West merger is far from complete. Captain McIlvenna is absolutely correct—US Air-
ways management cannot successfully merge without labor onboard. 

On behalf of the over 45,000 employees of Delta Air Lines, I am here to testify that 
we are not onboard for the hostile takeover of our company—not now, not tomorrow, 
not ever! 

My suggestion to Mr. Parker is this: If you want to run an airline, why don’t you 

start with the one you already have? 
3. Labor Issues 

In addition to the current in-house labor issues that US Airways management has 
failed  to  address,  US  Airways  management  ignores  provisions  of  the  collective  bar-

91 

gaining agreement that defines the relationship between Delta Air Lines and its pi-
lots,  despite  public  claims  to  the  contrary.  The  Delta  pilots  have  worked  under  a 
collective bargaining agreement—a labor contract—for almost seven decades. During 
the course of Delta’s bankruptcy, the Delta pilots and Delta management negotiated 
a  consensual  contract  at  great  expense  to  the  Delta  pilots.  That  is  one  reason  the 
U.S.  Trustee  appointed  ALPA  as  one  of  only  nine  members  on  the  Official  Com-
mittee  of  Unsecured  Creditors  and  why  ALPA  holds  one  of  the  largest  of  all  unse-
cured claims in Delta’s bankruptcy. 

The  pilot  contract  was  ratified  by  the  Delta  pilots  and  received  the  approval  of 
Delta  management,  the  Official  Committee  of  Unsecured  Creditors  and  the  Bank-
ruptcy  Court.  That  contract  contains  provisions  that  are  inconsistent  with  US  Air-
ways’ ability to achieve its proposed ‘‘synergies.’’ Given those provisions, many of the 
proposed  synergies  will  not  materialize.  Without  those  materialized  synergies,  the 
illusion of financial benefit evaporates. 

To date, US Airways management has refused to discuss the pilot contract in any-
thing other than superficial terms and they appear not to even understand its impli-
cations.  For  example,  in  response  to  just  a  single  contractual  provision,  CEO  Doug 
Parker  has  been  quoted  as  saying,  ‘‘We  don’t  know  enough  about  the  contract  and 
how  this  clause  came  to  be.’’  The  Delta  pilot  contract  is  a  part  of  Delta’s  Plan  of 
Reorganization  (POR)  and  must  be  a  part  of  any  such  POR.  Most  importantly,  the 
Delta  pilot  contract  is  binding  on  any  successor  or  affiliate,  including  a  transaction 
where Delta is bought by another carrier or holding company. 

Pilot  contract  issues  will  not  go  away  regardless  of  how  much  money  is  thrown 
at  this  merger.  Further,  the  Delta  pilots  will  not  change  any  provision  of  our  con-
tract in order to facilitate the hostile takeover of our company. 
4. Financial Issues 

There  are  a  number  of  issues  surrounding  the  financing  of  this  hostile  takeover 

attempt that I’d like to address individually. 

The  US  Airways  proposal  would  burden  the  combined  corporation  with  well  over 
$20 billion in debt, more debt than Delta owed when it entered bankruptcy in Sep-
tember  2005,  and  well  over  twice  the  debt  of  Delta’s  stand-alone  plan.  US  Airways 
management claims the ‘‘synergies’’ of the merger will allow the debt to be serviced. 
However, the synergies are grossly overstated. Further, any student of the American 
aviation industry will recognize that airline profits are based on razor-thin margins. 
Record profits in our industry are on a scale that would cause a management team 
to  be  fired  in  many  other  industries  with  similar  debt  loads.  No  airline  corporation 
has successfully serviced that level of debt for any substantial length of time. 

How can US Airways afford to make this offer? During the course of its own bank-
ruptcies,  US  Airways  dumped  $5  billion  of  pension  obligations  onto  the  lap  of  the 
Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  (PBGC).  Further,  both  US  Airways  and 
America  West  took  advantage  of  taxpayer-backed  loans  through  the  Air  Transpor-
tation  Stabilization  Board,  loans  that  have  yet  to  be  fully  repaid,  and  were  in  fact 
renegotiated  during  the  merger  of  US  Airways  and  America  West  (repayments  are 
scheduled  to  begin  later  this  year  and  stretch  through  2010).  Without  those  loans, 
according  to  Doug  Parker,  ‘‘America  West  probably  wouldn’t  have  survived  and 
without  America  West,  US  Airways  probably  wouldn’t  have  survived.’’ 2 Now,  with 
pension obligations shed and the assistance of the U.S. taxpayer, US Airways is able 
to  attract  the  financing  necessary  to  prey  on  their  most  significant  competitor  who 
did  not  use  an  ATSB  loan  and  who  fought  for  and  successfully  saved  most  of  their 
employee’s  pensions.  If  US  Airways  is  suddenly  flush  with  extra  cash,  perhaps  in-
stead  of  attempting  to  abuse  this  Nation’s  bankruptcy  laws,  those  ATSB  loans 
should be repaid and the pensions of their employees reinstated. 

Finally,  in  the  area  of  finances,  it  is  worth  looking  at  who  is  behind  the  curtain 
of  this  hostile  takeover  attempt.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  roughly  50  percent  of 
US Airways’ outstanding shares are owned by hedge funds with no long-term inter-
est  in  the  success  of  either  US  Airways  or  Delta.  Hedge  funds  focus  on  short-term 
financial gain and thrive on market volatility other investors shun. In addition, you 
may have heard of moves by a self-anointed ad hoc ‘‘Unofficial Committee of Unse-
cured Claimholders’’ that is supporting Parker’s efforts. These creditors also consist 
largely of hedge funds and financial institutions with no long-term interest in seeing 
either  Delta  or  US  Airways  succeed.  They  are  in  it  simply  for  the  short-term  gain. 
The  method  behind  their  perceived  gains  would  consist  almost  solely  of  forcing 
Delta Air Lines to remain in bankruptcy longer in order to wrest further concessions 
from  employees  and  reject  leases  on  aircraft  and  facilities.  Given  the  unique  quali-

ties  of  our  Nation’s  aviation  industry,  it  is  crucial  that  certain  segments  of  Wall 
Street not be allowed to drive public policy. 
Conclusion 

The  American  aviation  industry  has  been  through  the  worst  period  in  its  history 
in the last several years. Now, after numerous corporate restructurings, both in and 
out  of  bankruptcy,  there  are  strong  indications  of  an  industry  on  the  rebound.  Ca-
pacity is under control; there is no ‘‘need’’ to remove capacity through consolidation. 
Oil prices have moderated (for now.) Individual airlines have begun to see the fruits 
of their restructuring efforts and report profits again, several for the first time since 
9/11. 

If  the  Committee  would  indulge  me,  I  would  like  to  conclude  by  reiterating  what 

I stated at the beginning of my testimony. 

In the future, there may be airline merger opportunities that make sense. If faced 
with  the  possibility,  the  Delta  pilots  are  interested  in  participating  in  the  ‘‘right’’ 
consolidation  effort,  a  consensual  merger  with  a  rational  mix  of  routes,  employees 
and resources, and of the absence of antitrust and other issues that burden the cur-
rent proposal. The ‘‘right’’ merger opportunity could draw our support and result in 
a successful merger. 

The US Airways proposal is not that merger. Instead, US Airway’s proposal is an 
opportunistic effort under this Nation’s bankruptcy laws that would harm the trav-
eling  public,  the  communities  we  serve,  and  the  career  prospects  of  Delta,  America 
West and US Airways employees. As such, the Delta pilots and all Delta employees 
strongly oppose the US Airways merger attempt and support Delta and its manage-
ment’s efforts to reorganize as a stand-alone company. 

On  behalf  of  the  over  one  hundred  thousand  active  and  retired  professionals  of 

Delta Air Lines, thank you for the opportunity to be heard. 

COALITION FOR A PASSENGERS’ BILL OF RIGHTS 

January 21, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Inouye: 

As  you  may  know,  a  number  of  us  recently  endured  a  terrible  and  traumatic  or-
deal  at  the  hands  of  a  major  airline  during  the  New  Year’s  holiday.  As  concerned 
citizens,  we  are  now  respectfully  requesting  your  help  in  ensuring  that  our  experi-
ence  of  chaos  and  desperation  is  never  again  repeated  by  any  other  airline  in  the 
U.S. 

On December 29, 2006, we were on American Airlines Flight 1348 from San Fran-
cisco, California to Dallas, Texas. After being diverted to Austin, Texas due to heavy 
storms  in  Dallas,  hundreds  of  us,  including  families  with  young  children,  some  el-
derly, and some disabled persons, were forced to wait almost 9 hours on the tarmac 
of  Austin  Bergstrom  International  Airport,  enclosed  in  a  plane  with  no  running 
water  and  no  working  bathroom  facilities.  Additionally,  the  only  food  on  our  flight 
(AA  1348)  consisted  of  a  few  pretzel  snack  bags.  The  dead  cabin  air  became  stale 
and later polluted when the toilets began to overflow with human waste. There were 
other  flights,  too,  on  the  tarmac  that  day,  that  sat  for  protracted  times  with  disas-
trous results. 

In  light  of  this  horrific  experience,  and  most  importantly,  the  dismissive  attitude 
of  the  airlines  in  not  seeking  to  remedy  it  in  any  way,  we  are  forming  a  coalition 
of  travelers  whose  focus  it  is  to  develop  an  air  travelers’  bill  of  rights.  Enough  is 
enough.  This  is  not  the  first  nor  will  it  be  the  last  time  that  this  degrading  and 
humiliating treatment occurs. Without some corrective action, air travelers are sure 
to  continue  to  experience  being  treated  as  cattle  in  an  increasingly  uncompetitive 
airline industry. 

We  are  thus  hoping  that  the  Commerce  Committee  will  be  willing  to  commence 
hearings on legislation to create a passenger bill of rights. In addition, we are hope-
ful  that  the  Committee  will  consider  formally  recommending  to  the  Department  of 
Justice  and  Department  of  Transportation  that  a  passenger  bill  of  rights  should  be 
a  condition  of  approval  of  airline  acquisitions,  for  instance  Delta  Air  Lines  by  US 
Air. Such consumer-related conditions are common in business mergers and acquisi-
tions.  For  example,  the  Federal  Government  conditioned  AT&T’s  acquisition  of 
BellSouth with a host of consumer-related concerns.

93 

We  are  attaching  to  this  letter  a  proposed  draft  of  a  passenger  bill  of  rights  that 
includes  guarantees  for  basic  customer  service  standards,  caps  on  the  amount  of 
time  any  delayed  flight  can  be  kept  in  limbo  on  the  tarmac  without  allowing  pas-
sengers  to  de-plane,  and  to  ensure  that  the  dehumanizing  treatment—like  that 
which  we  experienced  in  Austin  where  food  and  essential  needs  are  withheld  for 
hours—cannot  occur.  We  are  also  urging  the  formal  implementation  of  a  Passenger 
Review Committee, not made up of non-airline executives and employees, but rather 
passengers and consumers—that would have the formal ability to review and inves-
tigate complaints. Our full set of recommendations is enclosed below. 

Indeed, in this context, history is repeating itself. For just back in 1999, customer 
service  had  reached  new  lows  when  Northwest  airlines  kept  thousands  of  pas-
sengers  trapped  on  grounded  planes  in  Detroit  for  hours.  Responding  to  the  tidal 
wave of consumer complaints, legislators then introduced a passenger bill of rights. 
The  airlines  sought  to  stave  off  the  legislation  by  initiating  their  own  set  of  non- 
binding ‘‘promises.’’ But as the Los Angeles Times recently reported, and a according 
to a report by the Department of Transportation, each of these promises was broken 
as easily as it was made in successive years. 

On  behalf  of  passengers  of  American  Airlines  flights  1348,  534,  1008  and  anyone 
who  has  been  forced  to  sleep  in  a  terminal  because  of  airline  delays,  anyone  who 
has  experienced  mind-numbing  delays  and  cancellations,  anyone  who  has  experi-
enced  the  blithe  and  dismissive  rudeness  that  too  frequently  accompanies  the  poor 
service, we are hopeful that you can help us light the fire of a new and long overdue 
consumer  movement  that  will  give  air  travelers  the  respect  and  fair  treatment  we 
deserve.

• Publish  and  update  monthly  on  the  company’s  public  website  a  list  of  chron-
ically  delayed  flights,  meaning  those  flight  delayed  thirty  minutes  or  more,  at 
least forty percent of the time, during a single month. 
• Compensate  ‘‘bumped’’  passengers  or  passengers  delayed  due  to  flight  cancella-
tions or postponements of over 12 hours by refund of 150 percent of ticket price. 
• The  formal  implementation  of  a  Passenger  Review  Committee,  not  made  up  of 
non-airline  executives  and  employees  but  rather  passengers  and  consumers— 
that would have the formal ability to review and investigate complaints. 
• Make  lowest  fare  information,  schedules  and  itineraries,  cancellation  policies 
and  frequent  flyer  program  requirements  available  in  an  easily  accessed  loca-
tion and updated in real-time. 
• Ensure  that  baggage  is  handled  without  delay  or  injury;  if  baggage  is  lost  or 
misplaced,  the  airline  shall  notify  customer  of  baggage  status  within  12  hours 
and provide compensation equal to current market value of baggage and its con-
tents. 
• Require that these rights apply equally to all airline code-share partners includ-

ing international partners. 

JANUARY 22,  2007  PRESS RELEASE—PASSENGERS STRANDED ON AMERICAN AIRLINES 
FLIGHT 1348  CALL ON THE U.S.  SENATE TO MAKE PASSENGERS BILL OF RIGHTS 
A PRIORITY 

Bill of Rights Sought as Precondition to Upcoming Airline Merger 

Napa Valley, CA—A group of passengers who were recently stranded on American 
Airlines  flight  #1348  for  over  8  hours  with  no  food  or  access  to  bathroom  facilities 
today called on Members of the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Trans-
portation  &  Infrastructure  Committee  to  hold  hearings  on  a  comprehensive  Pas-
sengers  Bill  of  Rights.  The  Passenger  Bill  of  Rights  would  modernize  and  improve 
airline industry standards for customer service. The group is also calling upon Mem-
bers to urge the Department of Transportation and Department of Justice to condi-
tion  the  merger  of  US  Airways  and  Delta  Air  Lines  on  the  adoption  of  such  a  Bill 
of Rights. 

‘‘We  feel  that  enough  is  enough.  This  is  not  the  first  time,  nor  is  it  likely  to  be 
the  last,  that  this  kind  of  degrading  treatment  is  visited  on  passengers,’’  said  Kate 
Hanni, one of the passengers from American Airlines flight 1348. ‘‘Thousands of le-
gitimate  complaints  by  travelers  mistreated  by  the  airlines  are  regularly  dismissed 
or inadequately addressed by the industry.’’ 

‘‘As  Congress  considers  airline  mergers,  it  is  the  perfect  time  to  finally  give  con-
sumers  and  taxpayers  what  we  deserve:  a  comprehensive,  enforceable  Passenger 
Bill of Rights,’’ added Hanni. 

On  December  29,  2006,  the  passengers  on  American  #1348  were  on  their  way 
from San Francisco, California to Dallas, Texas, and were diverted to Austin, Texas 
due to heavy storms in Dallas. In Austin, the passengers were forced to wait in the 
cabin for almost 9 hours with no running water and no working bathroom facilities. 
There  was  virtually  no  food,  and  the  stale  air  quickly  became  polluted  because  of 
a  sanitary  system  that  met  its  capacity.  Passengers  are  yet  to  receive  any  expla-
nation or apology from the company. 

Consumer-related  conditions  on  mergers  are  commonly  adopted,  including  most 
recently  with  the  AT&T/BellSouth  merger.  The  airlines  successfully  fought  and 
killed  Passenger  Bill  of  Rights  legislation  in  1999—a  move  that  was  initiated  after 
airlines kept thousands of passengers trapped on grounded planes for hours. 

Poor  customer  service  by  the  big  airlines  has  dramatically  worsened  over  the 
years.  One  recent  government  report  showed  that  the  airline  industry  reported  a 
six-year  low  in  on-time  statistics  in  November  2006.  Other  reports  have  shown  in-
creasing delays and declining customer service. 

The  passengers  of  American  Airlines  flight  1348,  534  and  1008  announced  they 
would  be  forming  a  national  grassroots  coalition  comprised  of  concerned  taxpayers 
and consumers dedicated to passing the Bill of Rights.

DELTA BOARD COUNCIL 

January 19, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 

The Delta Board Council, peer-selected employee advocates to the company’s sen-
ior  management  and  its  Board  of  Directors  for  the  nearly  40,000  ground  employees 
and  flight  attendants  of  Delta  Air  Lines,  is  writing  to  express  on  behalf  of  Delta 
employees  worldwide  our  resolute  and  unified  opposition  to  US  Airways’  proposed 
hostile takeover of Delta. 

Delta employees have made significant sacrifices since our company entered bank-
ruptcy.  We  have  endured  pay  cuts,  reductions  in  medical  benefits,  relocations,  and 
furloughs.  It  has  been  a  painful  experience  for  all.  Despite  these  hardships,  we  are 
unified  in  our  fight  against  this  hostile,  unsolicited  takeover  attempt  and  we  stand 
together in support of our company and its future for many reasons. 

First,  our  leadership  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  employees  by  leading 
the  effort  to  retain  our  pensions,  and  it  is  this  leadership  we  support.  Rather  than 
discard  all  pension  obligations,  we  together  fought  for  and,  with  the  determined  ef-
forts  of  Congressional  leaders,  achieved  legislation  that  provided  us  the  ability  to 
preserve  pensions  for  approximately  90,000  active  and  retired  non-pilot  employees. 
By  contrast,  US  Airways  defaulted  on  all  of  its  defined  benefit  pension  plans— 
though  somehow  it  came  up  with  the  funds  to  try  to  buy  our  airline.  This  is  not 
the type of leadership we could ever support. 

Second,  after  having  made  tremendous  sacrifices,  Delta  employees  have  been  a 
key  component  in  catalyzing  our  resurgence  as  a  vibrant,  customer-focused  airline 
and  we  have  earned  the  right  not  to  have  the  results  of  our  hard  work  and  our  in-
vestment  in  our  company  taken  from  us  or  placed  at  risk  by  the  US  Airways  deal. 
We  are  certain  that  US  Airways’  unsolicited  takeover,  based  on  shrinkage,  will 
reverse  our  progress.  It  will  dilute  our  brand.  It  will  negatively  impact  our  ability 
to deliver superior service. It will forever alter our culture of caring for, and dedica-
tion to, our customers and the communities we serve. 

Moreover, US Airways has made it clear that its bid depends on Delta remaining 
in  bankruptcy  during  a  very  arduous  regulatory  review  which,  in  view  of  the  com-
plexity  of  our  industry,  could  take  a  year  or  more.  The  longer  Delta  remains  in 
bankruptcy, the more everything we have worked so hard together to accomplish is 
at  risk—a  situation  we  are  unwilling  to  accept  because  we  were  forced  to  remain 
in bankruptcy by US Airways. 

Third,  we  believe  in  our  plan  and  want  to  emerge  from  bankruptcy  as  a  strong, 
stand-alone  company.  Our  leadership  has  worked  tirelessly  to  craft  a  plan  that  is 
working  for  Delta  employees,  our  customers,  the  communities  we  serve,  and  our 
other stakeholders. In short, Delta leaders and our people have engineered a resur-
gence  that  will  be  an  example  in  the  industry  for  years  to  come.  We  deserve  this 
chance at success and all of the potential it holds for Delta people. 

When  we  compare  what  Delta  management  has  said—and  proven—to  us  against 
US Airways’ record, our choice is clear and compelling. Through our efforts—on our 
aircraft,  behind  our  ticket  counters  and  reservation  desks,  in  our  hangars,  and  ev-
erywhere else we support Delta passengers—Delta is rapidly becoming the industry 
standard  in  passenger  satisfaction.  By  contrast,  US  Airways  does  not  even  appear 
to have the objective of achieving customer service excellence. 

Fourth,  we  are  concerned  about  the  loss  of  Delta  jobs  and  benefits  as  a  result  of 
this  merger.  In  a  recent  open  letter,  US  Airways  talked  carefully  about  avoiding 
‘‘layoffs’’  of  ‘‘frontline’’  employees.  In  reality,  the  US  Airways  plan  would  require 
that  capacity  be  reduced  by  at  least  10  percent.  That  in  turn  can  only  be  accom-
plished  by  eliminating  flights,  paring  our  fleet,  and  eliminating  approximately 
10,000  jobs.  We  are  convinced  that  their  assurance  about  frontline  employees  is 
merely tactical. It is one which, given US Airways’ contentious relationship with its 
own  employees—thousands  remain  on  furlough  15  months  after  they  merged  with 
America  West—gives  us  no  confidence  in  whatever  public  proclamations  are  made 
by US Airways. 

Moreover,  US  Airways  makes  no  effort  to  hide  the  fact  that  thousands  of  super-
visory and administrative employees will be fired or laid off, or, in their words, they 
will become bit players in pursuit of ‘‘synergies.’’ 

In  contrast,  in  2006  Delta  offered  recall  to  more  than  340  pilots,  approximately 

900 maintenance professionals and approximately 1,200 flight attendants.

96 

For  these  reasons,  we  are  steadfast  in  our  belief  that  a  strong  Delta  is  a  Delta 
that  emerges  from  bankruptcy  as  a  stand-alone  Delta.  To  that  end,  we  have 
launched a website, www.keepdeltamydelta.org, which is a public affirmation of our 
views and highlights our efforts throughout the world to rally opposition to US Air-
ways’  hostile  takeover  attempt.  The  site  shows  the  negative  impact  state-by-state 
that a US Airways/Delta merger likely would have on consumers and communities. 
Significantly,  the  site  also  has  attracted  more  than  100,000  signatures  from  Delta 
employees,  retirees,  frequent  flyers,  and  concerned  customers  in  support  of  a  letter 
opposing  US  Airways’  hostile  takeover  attempt.  In  that  letter,  we  sum  up  our  posi-
tion: 

We’ve  worked  hard  to  strengthen  and  improve  our  airline.  We  deserve  the 
chance  to  succeed  and  benefit  from  our  contributions,  which  we  have  accom-
plished together. We do not deserve to lose our jobs and benefits or to have US 
Airways place at risk the results of our hard work. 

Because Delta employees have so much at stake in our airline, because we believe 
that US Airways’ proposal is bad for our employees, customers, the communities we 
serve  and  our  other  stakeholders,  and  because  we  have  confidence  in  our  manage-
ment and in our plan, we have asked Gerald Grinstein, Delta’s Chief Executive Of-
fice, to deliver this letter to you when he testifies before the Committee on January 
24. We speak for our fellow employees. Jerry speaks for us. 

Sincerely, 

The  Delta  Board  Council:  Beth  Graham,  In-Flight  Representative;  Anne 
Larkin, ACS Representative; Bill Morey, Reservation Sales & City Ticket Of-
fices; Chris Muise, Supervisory & Administrative; Jack Roth, Technical Oper-
ations.

Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 

Dear Mr. Chairman: 
I  am  writing  on  behalf  of  the  nearly  10,000  non-pilot  retirees  and  dependents  of 
Delta  Air  Lines  who  are  members  of  the  Delta  Air  Lines  Retirement  Committee 
(DALRC),  which  I  chair.  I  also  write  to  you  on  behalf  over  36,500  Delta  non-pilot 
retirees, spouses, and survivors I represent as chair of the Section 1114 Committee 
appointed  by  the  bankruptcy  court  in  the  Delta  Air  Lines  case  to  represent  them 
in protecting their retiree medical benefits in Delta’s bankruptcy case. 

We welcome the Committee’s review of airline mergers and of the US Air takeover 
attempt  in  particular.  Our  message  to  the  Committee  is  simple.  We  are  absolutely 
opposed to a US Air-Delta merger. 

Delta  was  an  extraordinary  company  to  work  for,  and  even  in  difficult  times  it 
has  been  a  very  different  company  than  US  Air.  During  its  bankruptcy,  Delta  suc-
cessfully  lobbied  for  Congressional  legislation  that  would  allow  it  to  keep  its  prom-
ises  to  its  many  thousands  of  non-pilot  active  and  retired  employees  and  avoid  ter-
minating  their  pensions.  Facing  the  same  obstacles  in  their  efforts  to  reduce  cost 
and exit bankruptcy, US Air, in its two bankruptcies, eliminated its employees and 
retirees  pensions,  saddling  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  with  billions 
of  dollars  of  liabilities.  Delta  is  now  poised  to  achieve  profitability,  thanks  to  the 
enormous sacrifices of its employees and retirees, and is ready to emerge from bank-
ruptcy.  But  instead,  as  part  of  a  merger  US  Air  wants  Delta  to  remain  in  bank-
ruptcy  for  many  more  months  to  wring  out  additional  ‘‘synergies.’’  We  know  what 
that  means—more  Delta  employees  involuntarily  joining  the  ranks  of  our  retirees 
and perhaps even more retiree give backs. 

A US Air takeover will be bad for Delta employees and bad for US Air employees. 
‘‘Synergies’’  means  more  jobs  lost  and  fewer  choices  for  travel  for  the  customers  we 
serve.  And  US  Air’s  proposed  takeover  means  burdening  the  combined  airline  with 
billions of dollars of additional debt. Airlines are subject to cyclical economic swings 
and outside event risks that are hard to manage. An airline burdened by additional 
debt might not survive the next crisis. 

A  US  Air  takeover  would  not  just  reduce  competition.  US  Air  would  be  an  espe-
cially  chancy  partner  for  Delta.  Fifteen  months  into  its  merger  with  America  West, 
US  Air  still  has  not  settled  labor  issues  with  its  employees  and  has  not  merged  its 
separate reservations systems. US Air’s proposed takeover will require them to take

on  a  third  reservation  system,  additional  labor  contracts,  incompatible  fleets  and 
different domestic and international code-sharing arrangements. 

There  are  many  problems  with  US  Air’s  hostile  takeover  proposal—questionable 
revenue assumptions, huge new debt, and it fails antitrust law scrutiny—but for us, 
the  equation  is  simple.  If  Delta  succeeds  as  an  independent  airline,  Delta  retirees 
will  preserve  what  remains  of  our  benefits  for  which  we  worked  so  hard  and  that 
are so critical for so many of us. 

As  you  consider  the  state  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry,  and  hear  pronouncements 
from experts that there is excess capacity or that additional efficiencies are possible 
through  consolidation,  please  consider  two  things.  Those  high  sounding  phrases 
mask genuine human consequences. Real people lose jobs and pensioners lose health 
benefits and income security we worked a lifetime to achieve. 

And consider also that a US Air takeover is only possible because of the different 
way  the  two  companies  have  chosen  to  deal  with  their  employees  and  retirees  pen-
sion  obligations.  Delta  has  worked  to  continue  to  provide  the  earned  pension  bene-
fits  it  promised  to  its  many  thousands  of  non-pilot  employees  and  retirees,  and  is 
selling  at  a  discount  because  of  those  remaining  obligations.  US  Air  is  essentially 
using  the  savings  it  got  by  dumping  its  employees  and  retirees  pension  obligations 
to now fund this takeover attempt. 

US Air’s unwanted offer to Delta is a bad deal for Delta, for both airlines’ employ-
ees,  for  our  retirees,  for  the  security  of  our  pension  system,  for  customers,  and  for 
competition.  It  should  not  survive  antitrust  review,  but  if  it  did,  it  would  produce 
an  airline  so  burdened  with  debt,  at  the  next  difficulty  (and  in  the  airline  industry 
there are many) the combined airline would plunge back into bankruptcy. 

Please  accept  my  thanks  and  that  of  all  Delta  retirees  for  considering  our  views. 
As  a  gesture  of  our  true  solidarity  with  Delta  Air  Lines,  I  have  asked  Mr.  Gerald 
Grinstein to deliver this letter to you personally. 

Respectfully, 

CATHY CONE, 

Chair. 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 

Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 26, 2007 

FREDERICK C. FORD, A.A.E. 

Dear Chairman Inouye: 
I  am  writing  you  and  your  fellow  Members  of  the  Committee  on  Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation as a ‘‘friend of the Committee’’ and respectfully request 
this document be entered into the record of the aforementioned hearing on January 
24, 2007. 

Please allow me to present my credentials. 
I  am  a  former  General  Manager  of  Dallas/Fort  Worth,  Texas  International  Air-
port,  Director  of  Aviation  for  the  Massachusetts  Port  Authority  and  Vice  President 
of Pan American World Airways. 

My  current  business  as  a  consultant  causes  me  to  travel  over  150,000  air  miles 
per  year  and  I  am  a  member  of  the  US  Airways  and  Delta  Air  Lines  frequent  flier 
programs and often fly over 100,000 mile per year on Delta. 

Senator  Boxer  may  be  familiar  with  my  testimony  before  the  House  Government 
Operations  Subcommittee  in  the  investigation  of  Pan  Am  103  during  which  I  be-
came  an  advocate  for  the  families  of  the  victims  and  this  evidences  that  I  am  not 
a  blind  supporter  of  the  airlines  or  the  airline  industry.  I  am,  in  fact,  an  advocate 
for the consumer and passenger rights. 

I  respectfully  submit  that  I  am  reasonably  qualified  to  comment  on  the  topic  of 
airline  mergers  and  their  impact  on  the  industry,  employees  and  traveling  public. 
If  I  may,  I  would  like  to  submit  my  views  as  to  the  merits  and  impacts  of  the 

hostile merger/acquisition of Delta Air Lines by US Airways. 

As  a  preface  to  my  remarks  I  submit  that  I  have  not  been  the  recipient  of  any 
compensation or consideration of any kind by either Delta Air Lines or US Airways. 

Allow me to comment first from the airport operator viewpoint. 
As the former CEO/COO of airports large and small served by Delta, US Airways 
and  others,  I  submit  that  Delta  Air  Lines,  in  its  past  and  current  configurations, 
has  always  been  regarded  as  a  ‘‘people’’  airline.  Whether  it  is  for  its  passengers  or 
its employees, Delta, from its very inception in Monroe, Louisiana, has always taken 
pride in serving its customers with reasonably good service and lowest possible fares 
and has always considered its relationships with its employees as a partnership. 

Delta’s  employees,  in  the  mid-1980s,  bought  a  Boeing  767  for  Delta  as  a  gesture 
of  support,  appreciation  and  loyalty  to  their  company  to  evidence  this  partnership.

Delta  has  always  been  amongst  the  first  of  major  airlines  to  outreach  to  cities 
they  serve  and  to  airports  from  which  they  operate  to  support  local  initiatives 
whether  they  be  for  charitable  purposes  or  new  facility  construction  such  as  Ter-
minal  A  in  Boston,  where,  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  9/11,  Delta  recommitted 
to its financial support. Delta stood tall for Boston and New England. 

Delta has a corporate philosophy of being a partner with communities they serve 
and  they  have  always  been  there  to  support  the  airport,  city  and  state  from  which 
they  operate  whether  it  be  for  an  aircraft  to  use  for  a  disaster  drill  or  to  providing 
representation  from  senior  management  to  seek  solutions  to  serious  local  issues 
such  as  congestion  at  La  Guardia  or  the  recovery  of  traffic  from  the  impacts  of  9/ 
11. Delta is a solid community citizen. 

From an airline employee perspective, Delta has always been a leader in fairness 
of  policies  and  compensation  to  its  employees  as  evidenced  by  it  being  one  of  very 
few large companies where the employees, in general, have not felt the need to have 
collective bargaining representation. 

One  just  has  to  look  at  the  history  of  mergers  and  acquisitions,  namely  the  days 
of  the  Texas  Air  Corp  acquisitions  of  People  Xpress,  Eastern,  and  Frontier  or  the 
ill-fated Pan Am/National Airlines merger where corporate cultures, union mistrust 
of management and the creation of monopoly markets caused employee unrest, loss 
of wages, benefits, retirement programs and employee life savings. 

An  industry  that  once  was  considered  to  be  among  the  very  best  places  to  work 

has become, in many cases, one step above temporary employment. Why? 

It is because of corporate greed and not caring about employees, passengers, pub-
lic  and  private  debt  obligations  or  the  economic  futures  and  well  being  of  families 
of thousands of employees! It may be called the Icahn-Lorenzo Effect! 

While  Delta  has  sought  and  received  sacrifices  from  its  employees,  it  is  largely 
intact  from  whence  the  latest  rounds  of  airline  restructuring  began.  It  still  has 
many  senior  30-plus-year  employees  and  it  treats  its  employees  with  respect  and 
dignity. 

Delta’s  leadership,  from  Mr.  Grinstein,  Mr.  Whitehurst  and  Mr.  Macenczack  at 
corporate  headquarters  to  39  year  employee  Lois  Goral  at  the  Crown  Room  in  Bos-
ton  have  been  dedicated  to  providing  service  at  levels  where  the  customer  is  com-
pletely  unaware  of  the  financial  standing  of  the  company.  At  Delta,  people  come 
first! 

Airline mergers and acquisitions do result in higher fares, reduced levels of serv-
ice  and  declines  in  service  levels.  The  cliche´ ‘‘competition  is  good  for  the  consumer’’ 
didn’t  start  with  the  airline  business  but  it  is  well  stated.  The  market  is  better 
served  with  competition . . . just  ask  Senator  Schumer,  where  the  State  of  New 
York and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey provided support and assist-
ance  to  JetBlue  to  foster  competition,  increase  employment,  provide  service  to  un-
derserved communities and, most of all, create economic development. 

Mr.  Chairman,  please  count  this  very  experienced  traveler  to  be  a  supporter  of 
market driven economics rather than forced and unwelcome consolidation. There are 
no  beneficiaries  other  than  the  investment  bankers  and  stock  options  for  the  cor-
porate raiders. 

Let  Delta  and  other  carriers  explore  together  in  a  voluntary  manner  rather  than 
cheating  thousand  of  employees,  numerous  cities  and  town,  and  purchasers  of  air-
port  facility  bonds.  These  companies  are  public  utilities  and,  therefore,  the  public 
interest must be considered from all perspectives. 

There  is  a  very  simple  question  and  answer  to  the  suggested  benefits  proffered 
by  US  Airways.  Is  the  elimination  of  a  great  company  and  the  destruction  of  the 
futures of thousands of employees and families a justifiable price to pay so one seg-
ment of the market can fly once per year to Disney World for under $200.00? I think 
not! 

Thank  you  very  much  for  considering  these  thoughts.  You  and  the  Members  of 
the  Committee  have  a  daunting  task  to  consider  and  the  well-being  of  thousands 
of  people  relying  upon  your  diligent  and  thorough  review  of  the  matter.  The  delib-
erations  may  be  difficult  but  the  wrong  answer  may  create  an  abundance  of  per-
sonal  bankruptcies,  lost  savings  and  a  retirement  of  lost  dreams.  Please  use  your 
wisdom thoughtfully. 

Sincerely, 

FREDERICK C. FORD, A.A.E.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG 

99 

Question  1.  The  point  of  consolidation  is  to  address  the  fundamental  problem  of 
overcapacity that has plagued the industry over the past several years. It is a mat-
ter  of  too  many  seats  chasing  too  few  consumers.  Recently,  however,  trends  have 
turned  in  the  opposite  directions.  Airlines  have  constrained  growth,  and  even  cut 
capacity  in  some  cases,  and  load  factors  are  at  all  time  highs.  Given  these  trends, 
is consolidation really needed? 

Answer.  The  term  ‘‘consolidation’’  inevitably  evokes  the  idea  of  mega-mergers 
when  discussing  the  airline  industry.  As  stated  in  my  written  testimony,  my  view 
is  that  mergers  are  by  no  means  an  elixir  for  the  airline  industry.  Merging  two  air 
carriers is a complex, risky, and expensive endeavor. I think there are two questions 
that should be considered: whether consolidation is necessary and whether it is de-
sirable. The question of whether consolidation is necessary is best answered directly 
by the marketplace itself. The trends cited in your question such as airlines cutting 
capacity and increasing load factors are best characterized as airlines’ tactical meas-
ures  to  regain  their  financial  footing  in  the  immediate  term.  Consolidation,  on  the 
other  hand,  involves  long-term  strategic  decisions  of  airlines’  to  merge  with  other 
firms,  sell  certain  assets,  or  to  even  exit  the  marketplace.  These  types  of  decisions 
are  not  typically  made  in  direct  response  to  the  vagaries  of  business  cycles.  Rather 
these  decisions  take  into  account  a  long-term  view  of  the  competitive  landscape, 
macroeconomic  trends,  and  resource  constraints.  The  free-market,  and  not  the  gov-
ernment,  is  the  best  arbiter  to  assimilate  all  the  data  and  deliver  an  optimal  out-
come. 

This  is  not  to  say  the  government  does  not  have  an  important  role.  Rather  it  is 
important for the government to keep an open mind and maintain a neutral stance 
acting  only  when  there  is  clear  evidence  that  the  public  interest  would  be  harmed 
by a transaction or other event. Both DOT and the Department of Justice are poised 
to  evaluate,  and  if  necessary,  remedy  anticompetitive  effects  such  as  higher  fares 
or  reduced  service  options  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of  consolidation.  However  as 
I  state  above,  I  believe  it  is  important  that  the  government  take  a  neutral  stance 
and keep an open mind as mergers may very well succeed in some instances. 

As  to  whether  consolidation  is  desirable,  it  depends  on  the  ultimate  objective. 
Consolidation could possibly reduce the volatility associated with extreme boom-and- 
bust  cycles  that  have  historically  affected  the  industry.  U.S.  airlines  have  done  a 
remarkable  job  at  increasing  efficiency  and  cutting  costs  in  the  past  5  years.  How-
ever,  I  do  not  believe  the  long-term  volatility  that  plagues  the  airline  industry  is 
truly gone despite recent reductions in capacity. Rather I think it is has been simply 
obscured  by  relatively  good  macroeconomic  conditions  and,  if  history  is  any  guide, 
will return during the next economic slowdown. 

Question  2.  Is  it  possible,  particularly  if  one  merger  leads  to  a  flurry  of  activity, 
that  the  efficiency  benefits  of  consolidation  will  be  outweighed  by  higher  fares  and 
fewer service options? 

Answer.  To  paraphrase  your  second  question,  you  ask  whether  it  is  possible  that 
a  wave  of  mergers  resulting  from  a  domino  effect  precipitated  by  a  single  merger 
could  result  in  higher  fares  and  fewer  service  options  that  offset  any  efficiency 
gains?  It  is  far  from  certain  that  a  single  merger  would  beget  a  series  of  mergers. 
In  any  case,  entry  into  the  airline  industry  remains  essentially  unfettered.  The  dif-
ficulties of the past 5 years have not deterred entrepreneurs from starting new low- 
cost  carriers  (LCC)  nor  has  it  deterred  existing  low-cost  airlines  from  expanding. 
The LCCs and their ability to enter markets serve as formidable check on the pric-
ing power of large airlines in most of the Nation. Mergers are often sought in order 
to  attain  new  efficiencies.  Thus  I  think  it  is  entirely  plausible  that  certain  mergers 
could result in intensified competition within the industry. 

Question  3.  What  are  the  potential  benefits  of  consolidation  given  the  current 

state of the airline industry? 

Answer.  In  response  to  your  question  about  the  potential  upside  of  consolidation, 
I think there is the potential for consolidation to create benefits for the public. One 
potential  benefit  would  be  intensified  competition  amongst  airlines  as  airlines  with 
newly attained efficiencies aggressively leverage those gains in the marketplace. An-
other potential benefit is that consolidation could spur new forms of competition. In 
the United States, air travel has become increasingly commoditized and with terms 
of  competition  primarily  limited  to  price  and  schedules.  Consolidation  could  lead  to 
the emergence of new business models that compete on the basis of different product 
attributes  such  as  on-board  service.  Another  possible  benefit  of  consolidation  would 
be  a  more  stable  airline  industry  consisting  of  companies  with  the  financial  where-
withal  to  weather  business  cycles.  In  addition  to  layoffs  and  painful  wage  cuts,  the

most  recent  downturn  precipitated  a  series  of  pension  defaults  that  not  only  de-
prived  airlines  employees  and  retirees  of  their  benefits  but  also  exposed  the  tax-
payer  to  a  potential  liability.  These  are  not  harbingers  of  a  healthy  industry.  Thus 
I believe to the extent consolidation may foster financial stability within the indus-
try, it could be considered a benefit. 

Question 4. Some industry experts suggest that consolidating down to three large 
airlines is needed to best ensure the financial stability of the airline industry. What 
is your view of this? Would this appropriately balance the need for ensuring the fi-
nancial stability of the industry with consumer interests? 

Answer.  I  do  not  believe  there  is  a  ‘‘magic’’  number  of  large  airlines  that  would 
ensure  the  financial  stability  of  the  airline  industry.  As  you  note  many  commenta-
tors  suggest  that  three  airlines  would  be  optimal,  but  I  think  the  more  important 
underlying idea in their observations is that market forces are trying to rationalize 
the industry and could result in fewer (but larger) network carriers. 

Question  5.  Mergers  have  a  history  of  problems  in  the  airlines  industry.  To  what 
extent  is  it  likely  a  merger  could  actually  realize  the  efficiencies  given  the  difficul-
ties of integrating labor forces and other complex issues? 

Answer. It is extremely difficult to say in general whether a merger could actually 
realize  the  efficiencies  that  may  exist.  Even  with  a  specific  hypothetical,  it  would 
be  a  challenging  intellectual  exercise  to  make  such  a  prediction  with  a  high  degree 
of  confidence.  Historically,  some  airlines  mergers  have  successfully  generated  effi-
ciencies  while  others  have  not  succeeded  for  the  reasons  you  have  cited.  As  I  men-
tioned earlier, I think the best stance for the government would be to let the market 
determine  the  merits  of  a  particular  transaction  and  intervene  only  when  there  is 
a clear risk to the public interest. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG 

Question 1. Can you describe in detail the Department of Transportation’s role in 
the  review  process  and  how  it  would  determine  whether  the  merger  strengthens  or 
reduces competition? 

Question  2.  Is  there  are  threshold  that  you  use  in  individual  markets  where  you 
don’t  allow  an  air  carrier  to  have  more  than  a  certain  percentage  of  the  market? 
What’s the cutoff? 

Answer to Questions 1 and 2. Airline mergers are reviewed by both the Antitrust 
Division  of  the  Department  of  Justice  (Antitrust  Division)  and  the  Department  of 
Transportation (DOT). The Antitrust Division is responsible for determining wheth-
er  the  transaction  will  be  challenged  under  the  antitrust  laws.  DOT  conducts  its 
own competitive analysis of proposed mergers and by practice submits its views and 
findings  to  the  Antitrust  Division  privately.  DOT’s  analysis  is  based  on  traditional 
antitrust  precepts  that  define  markets  typically  as  city  pairs  such  as  Boston-Char-
lotte  or  Baton  Rouge-Los  Angeles.  DOT  measures  the  concentration  using  metrics 
such as the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI) and assesses the overall competitive 
effect that the proposed merger would likely have in affected markets. We also look 
at  other  factors  such  as  airport  capacity  constraints  that  tend  to  increase  the  risk 
of competitive harm. The more likely a merger is to increase concentration, the more 
likely  it  is  to  be  deemed  anticompetitive  and  thus  subject  to  challenge  or  remedial 
measure. There is not, however, any threshold percentage for market share that will 
automatically indicate whether a merger may lead to anticompetitive effects. 

Finally, DOT’s competitive analyses may also encompass issues such as effects on 
network  competition,  effects  on  service  to  small  communities,  and  whether  a  trans-
action may constitute an unfair method of competition or a deceptive trade practice. 
Question 3. In your written testimony, you make clear that the government should 
not  ‘‘purposefully  of  inadvertently  prevent  the  industry  from  undertaking  the  re-
structuring  demanded  by  the  market  forces,’’  and  that  this  philosophy  applies  to 
consolidation. Do you feel consolidation is necessary or inevitable, and do you think 
it will benefit the airline industry? 

Question 3a. If so, how will the Department of Transportation review this merger 
objectively  if  its  philosophy  is  that  the  government  should  let  market  forces  work 
themselves out? 

Question 3b. If this merger is approved, what happens in small markets that may 
only  have  3  or  4  carriers  that  both  US  Airways  and  Delta  serve  that  would  see  4 
carriers reduced to 3 or 3 carriers reduced to 2? What action would the Department 
take to ensure competition in those markets?

101 

Question  3c.  What  action  would  the  Department  take  in  Boston  or  any  market 
that both airlines serve if another airline isn’t interested in that market in the wake 
of any divestitures that the new airline would have to make? 

Answer.  The  question  of  whether  consolidation  is  necessary  is  best  answered  di-
rectly  by  the  marketplace  itself.  Trends  such  as  airlines  cutting  capacity  and  in-
creasing  load  factors  are  best  characterized  as  airlines’  tactical  measures  to  regain 
their  financial  footing  in  the  immediate  term.  Consolidation,  on  the  other  hand,  in-
volves  long-term  strategic  decisions  of  airlines’  to  merge  with  other  firms,  sell  cer-
tain  assets,  or  to  even  exit  the  marketplace.  These  types  of  decisions  are  not  typi-
cally  made  in  direct  response  to  the  vagaries  of  business  cycles.  Rather  these  deci-
sions  take  into  account  a  long-term  view  of  the  competitive  landscape,  macro-
economic  trends,  and  resource  constraints.  The  free-market,  and  not  the  govern-
ment, is the best arbiter to assimilate all the data and deliver an optimal outcome. 
Consolidation  may  benefit  the  airline  industry  although  that  is  not  a  certainty. 
It  could  result  in  a  more  stable  airline  industry  consisting  of  companies  with  the 
financial  wherewithal  to  weather  business  cycles.  In  the  relatively  fragmented  in-
dustry  we  have  today,  each  economic  downturn  brings  with  it  painful  and  some-
times dramatic rounds of layoffs, pay cuts, and bankruptcy filings. The most recent 
downturn  precipitated  a  series  of  pension  defaults  which  not  only  deprived  airlines 
employees and retirees of their benefits but also exposed the taxpayer to a potential 
liability. These are not harbingers of a healthy industry. Thus I believe to the extent 
consolidation  may  foster  financial  stability  within  the  industry,  it  would  be  a  ben-
efit. 

DOT  does  not  prejudge  the  competitive  effects  of  any  proposed  merger.  Instead, 
we  review  each  transaction  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  We  have  ample  authority  and 
opportunity to consider whether a proposed merger would substantially reduce com-
petition  and  to  coordinate  with  the  Department  of  Justice  any  proposed  remedies. 
The issue of remedies to the proposed US Airways/ Delta merger with regard to Bos-
ton or other markets, is moot. US Airways has withdrawn its takeover bid. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG 

Question.  The  skies  have  been  pretty  bumpy  for  airlines  in  recent  years.  The  Air 
Transportation  Stabilization  Board  (ATSB)  guaranteed  billions  in  loans  and  pen-
sions  have  been  dumped  on  the  PBGC.  This  essentially  means  the  merger  is  being 
funded by the taxpayers. And with a ‘‘new Delta’’ looking to end up with $23 billion 
in  debt—up  from  the  $10  billion  Delta  would  hold  coming  out  of  bankruptcy.  What 
kind  of  stability  concerns  does  that  raise?  Are  there  any  indications  that  taxpayers 
would  end  up  bailing  out  a  ‘‘new  Delta’’  on  a  grander  scale  than  we’ve  already  had 
to do? 

Answer.  As  you  are  aware,  US  Airways’  takeover  bid  for  Delta  has  been  with-
drawn.  Many  critics  of  the  takeover  bid  raised  concern  over  the  amount  of  debt  in-
volved  in  the  transaction—specifically,  concern  that  the  ‘‘new’’  Delta  would  have 
been  excessively  leveraged  upon  its  exit  from  bankruptcy,  thereby  weakening  its 
overall prospects for success. Going forward, DOT will continue its practice of care-
fully  monitoring  the  financial  condition  of  airlines  in  order  to  assess  the  impact  of 
any  particular  carrier’s  distress  on  the  overall  health  of  the  air  transportation  sys-
tem. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG 

Question.  Labor  costs  are  one  of  the  highest  costs  for  air  carriers.  Is  it  an  unfair 
competitive  advantage  for  airlines  to  be  required  to  fully  fund  their  employee  pen-
sion  plans  while  others  are  relieved  of  pension  obligations  through  bankruptcy  or 
other procedures? 

Answer. It is true that labor costs constitute a major portion of U.S. airlines’ total 
costs.  It  is  also  true  that  a  major  source  of  financial  distress  for  certain  legacy  car-
riers is the size of the accumulated pension liability. Most of the major carriers have 
under-funded  their  employee’s  pensions  by  billions  of  dollars.  Several  carriers  have 
declared  bankruptcy  and  used  the  bankruptcy  process  to  terminate  their  pension 
plans  and  offload  the  costs  to  the  Federal  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation 
(PBGC).  As  a  result  of  accumulated  losses  and  pension  fund  shortfalls,  the  airlines 
account  for  almost  40  percent  of  PBGC  claims.  And  while  accounting  for  almost  40 
percent  of  claims  from  failed  plans,  the  airlines  have  paid  approximately  3  percent 
of the total premiums in the history of the guarantee fund, according to the PBGC.

Respected  airline  industry  analysts  have  frequently  observed  the  airline  industry 
is,  paradoxically,  relatively  easy  to  enter  and  hard  to  leave—sometimes  character-
izing  this  phenomenon  as  an  ‘‘exit  barrier’’  for  failed  firms  that  is  the  inadvertent 
consequence  of  the  Chapter  11  reorganization  process.  They  point  out  that  airline 
stakeholders  (lenders,  suppliers  and  employees)—any  one  of  whom  could  singly 
cause an air carrier’s demise—rarely force such an outcome and instead trade in old 
contractual  arrangements  and  debt  for  new  ones.  And  the  net  result  of  those  deci-
sions  is,  perversely  enough,  that  airline  employees  make  big  sacrifices,  and  that 
those carriers who manage to avoid bankruptcy eventually find themselves at a seri-
ous competitive disadvantage. Given that one of DOT’s statutory mandates is to ‘‘en-
courage efficient and well-managed air carriers to earn adequate profits and attract 
capital’’, this situation is problematic. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG 

Question 1. If the US Airways/Delta merger were approved by the Department of 
Justice,  many  believe  it  would  send  a  signal  to  the  other  four  legacy  carriers  that 
consolidation  is  acceptable.  Do  you  think  that  the  other  legacy  carriers  would  want 
to merge in order to remain competitive? 

Answer. The proposed takeover bid by US Airways for Delta has been withdrawn 
by  the  management  of  US  Airways.  However,  industry  analysts  and  policymakers 
debate  whether  the  US  Airways/Delta  transaction  would  have  triggered  a  wave  of 
mergers. It is not clear. 

The possibility of a domino effect resulting in a wave of mergers would be depend-
ent  on  the  nature  of  the  initial  transaction.  A  carrier  would  likely  evaluate  the  im-
pact  of  a  merger  between  two  (or  more)  of  its  competitors  on  its  own  competitive 
position  and  then  determine  whether  a  strategic  response  is  necessary  or  prudent. 
In  some  cases,  a  merger  or  acquisition  could  be  the  optimal  response.  In  making 
this  decision,  carriers  are  likely  to  evaluate  not  only  the  scale  and  scope  of  the  ini-
tial  transaction,  but  also  other  factors  such  as  execution  risk,  potential  antitrust 
remedies,  and  an  evaluation  of  alternatives  to  a  follow-on  merger  transaction,  such 
as organic growth, market innovation, or marketing alliances. 

Question  2.  What  would  be  the  effect  on  the  flying  public  if  the  U.S.  had  only 

three major airlines instead of six? 

Answer. Because we review mergers on a case-by-case basis, DOT has not had oc-
casion  to  consider  whether  consolidation  resulting  in  three  versus  six  network  car-
riers would be in the public interest. Nor do we normally opine on the myriad hypo-
thetical  situations  often  discussed  in  the  media.  But  I  believe  it  is  far  from  certain 
that  a  single  merger  would  beget  a  series  of  mergers.  In  any  case,  entry  into  the 
airline  industry  remains  essentially  unfettered.  The  difficulties  of  the  past  5  years 
have  not  deterred  entrepreneurs  from  starting  new  low-cost  carriers  (LCC)  nor  has 
it deterred existing low-cost airlines from expanding. Additionally, the low-cost car-
riers  and  their  ability  to  enter  markets  serve  as  a  formidable  check  on  the  pricing 
power of large airlines in much of the Nation. 

Question  3.  What  impact  would  such  a  merger  have  on  low-cost  carriers  like 

Southwest? 

Answer. The airline industry is highly competitive. History has shown that when 
carriers merge or exit a market, other domestic carriers may enter and fill the serv-
ice void. Low-cost carriers such as Southwest are the fastest growing carriers, often 
exceeding  10  percent  growth  in  capacity  per  year.  It  is  likely  that  low-cost  carriers 
will continue to expand capacity and serve new markets, regardless of merger activ-
ity among the legacy carriers. 

Question 4. If this merger ultimately does not go through, what do you see is the 

future of the six ‘‘legacy carriers?’’ 

Answer.  US  Airways’  withdrawal  of  its  takeover  bid  for  Delta  has  not  lessened 
DOT’s  monitoring  of  the  financial  performance  of  U.S.  airlines.  As  I  stated  in  my 
written  testimony,  short-term  prospects  for  the  airline  industry  appear  quite  favor-
able based on the following factors: 

demand. 

• Positive revenue trends due to slower domestic capacity growth and very strong 
• Higher  average  yields  in  part  due  to  less  capacity  pressure  from  low-cost  car-
• Strong economic growth in the United States. 
• Continued cost discipline.

• Improved balance sheets with encouraging levels of current free cash-flow. 
Over the long term, however, the outlook for the U.S. airline industry is more un-
certain.  The  industry  faces  persistent  structural  problems  that  must  be  addressed 
if  we  are  to  avoid  facing  another  wave  of  bankruptcies  in  the  next  economic  down-
turn,  and  if  the  industry  is  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  very  substantial  progress 
made in lowering unit costs. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

HON. ANDREW B. STEINBERG 

Question. As the airline industry continues to consolidate it is inevitable that anti- 
trust  concerns  arise.  In  the  case  where  the  proposed  mergers  would  result  in  the 
creation  of  a  ‘‘mega-carrier’’  with  a  significant  percentage  of  the  domestic  market 
under their control, how can we ensure that the consolidation of this carrier’s over-
lapping  route  structure  will  not  result  in  a  lack  of  competition  that  will  negatively 
affect the American traveler, especially in relation to low volume flight routes where 
low-cost  carriers  are  not  likely  to  enter  into  competition  with  the  larger  airlines? 
Answer.  Today,  the  airline  industry  is  extremely  competitive,  with  six  network 
(hub-and-spoke)  airlines  and  several  low-cost  airlines  that  effectively  set  prices  for 
the  entire  industry.  The  industry  is  somewhat  less  concentrated  today  than  it  was 
30  years  ago  prior  to  deregulation.  Entry  into  the  industry  remains  easy  and,  con-
versely,  several  factors  (described  at  greater  length  in  my  written  testimony)  have 
combined to create ‘‘exit barriers.’’ 

While  the  Department  of  Justice’s  Antitrust  Division  (DOJ)  has  primary  jurisdic-
tion  to  review  proposed  mergers  and  prevent  those  that  substantially  lessen  com-
petition,  the  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  also  reviews  mergers  to  make 
sure consumers are more broadly protected. Under our governing statute DOT pur-
sues  several  statutory  goals:  promoting  competition,  encouraging  efficient  and  well- 
managed  air  carriers  to  earn  adequate  profits,  strengthening  the  competitive  posi-
tion  of  U.S.  airlines  in  relation  to  foreign  air  carriers,  and  protecting  the  interests 
of  small  communities  in  maintaining  access  to  the  air  transportation  system.  (See 
49  U.S.C.  Section  40101.)  DOT,  in  consultation  with  DOJ,  carefully  reviews  each 
major  airline  transaction  on  a  case-by-case  basis  evaluating  changes  in  concentra-
tion that it creates across all routes. 

I  recognize  the  mandate  that  Congress  has  given  DOT  to  ensure  that  small  com-
munities  receive  adequate  and  affordable  air  service.  We  consider  this  issue  to  be 
a  relevant  and  crucial  part  of  any  merger  investigation  we  do.  It  is  important  to 
note, however, that service to small communities often depends on the overall finan-
cial  success  of  the  hub-and-  spoke  networks  of  larger  carriers.  This  is  because  it  is 
the  thinner  routes  (i.e.,  with  fewer  passengers)  that  tend  to  be  the  least  profitable 
and thus the first to be eliminated in bad financial times. In fact, over the last sev-
eral years, as our network carriers lost record sums, they reduced capacity and the 
size of their networks, directly resulting in cutbacks in service on low volume routes. 
(During the same period, obligations of the Essential Air Service program grew com-
mensurately). Thus, it is not apparent that preventing consolidation would improve 
small community air service. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

GERALD GRINSTEIN 

Question 1. It is a significant concern of mine that any consolidation in the airline 
industry does not adversely affect the airline customer in our smaller communities. 
With  a  number  of  smaller  communities’  airports  already  suffering  from  high  ticket 
costs and a lack of flight options, how will the continued consolidation of the indus-
try affect these communities in the future? And in particular how will the proposed 
merger  between  US  Airways  and  Delta  affect  the  small  communities  in  Louisiana? 
Answer. Impact on small communities would really depend on the type of consoli-
dation.  For  example,  end-to-end  mergers  among  U.S.  airlines  could  improve  service 
options  and  fares  for  small  communities.  However,  mergers  between  carriers  with 
dramatically  overlapping  networks—like  the  proposed  US  Airways-Delta  merger— 
would  have  a  very  negative  impact  on  those  communities,  mainly  because  the  so- 
called  benefits  from  such  a  merger  would  come  from  reduction  of  capacity,  which 
would  reduce  service  options  and  raise  fares.  And,  the  sorts  of  communities  that 
would  be  negatively  impacted  are  not  the  sort,  as  Mr.  Parker  admitted  earlier  in 
this  hearing,  that  low-cost  carriers  would  flock  to  serve.  So,  the  small  communities 
wouldn’t likely see replacement service or low fares any time soon.

Question  2.  Delta  Air  Lines  employs  over  400  people  in  Louisiana  and  has  had 
a  long  and  distinguished  history  in  my  home  state  from  it’s  inception  in  Monroe, 
Louisiana in 1928. I am concerned that the further consolidation of the industry will 
lead  to  many  of  these  people  losing  their  livelihoods.  How  is  the  industry  going  to 
consolidate  and  reduce  fleet  capability  to  remain  profitable  while  not  dismissing  a 
good number of their employees? 

Answer. The impact on employees of industry consolidation would really hinge on 
the sort of merger sought. An end-to-end merger where two carriers that don’t have 
overlapping  networks  get  together,  resulting  in  new  service  options  for  passengers, 
would  be  challenging  from  an  employee  standpoint,  since  you  would  likely  have  to 
merge  different  cultures—but  it  wouldn’t  necessarily  result  in  job  losses.  However, 
consolidation  between  overlapping  carriers  like  a  US  Airways-Delta  merger  would 
definitely result in job losses. Many of the so-called ‘‘benefits’’ to be gained from the 
proposed US Airways-Delta merger will come from the immediate elimination of 10 
percent  capacity.  In  our  estimate,  that  equates  to  about  200  aircraft—larger  than 
AirTran’s  entire  fleet—that  are  supported  currently  by  about  10,000  employees.  A 
company  could  not  operate  profitably  with  10,000  extra  employees  sitting  around— 
the  financiers  would  never  allow  it—and  attrition  won’t  occur  quickly  enough  to 
eliminate  those  positions.  So,  you’d  see  significant  job  losses,  coming  in  particular 
from communities where the carriers overlap. 

Question  3.  As  the  airline  industry  continues  to  consolidate  it  is  inevitable  that 
anti-trust  concerns  arise.  In  the  case  where  the  proposed  mergers  would  result  in 
the creation of a ‘‘mega-carrier’’ with a significant percentage of the domestic market 
under their control, how can we ensure that the consolidation of this carrier’s over-
lapping  route  structure  will  not  result  in  a  lack  of  competition  that  will  negatively 
affect the American traveler, especially in relation to low volume flight routes where 
low-cost  carriers  are  not  likely  to  enter  into  competition  with  the  larger  airlines? 
Answer. Again, it depends on the sort of merger—an end-to-end merger might en-
hance competition by providing new access for passengers to a global network. How-
ever,  there’s  really  no  way  to  police  the  impact  of  a  ‘‘mega-carrier’’  that  dominates 
specific  regions  of  the  country,  once  that  sort  of  merger  is  executed,  and  I  would 
say  that  in  the  case  of  a  US  Airways-Delta  merger,  if  the  DOJ  approved  it—and 
it  wouldn’t  likely  do  so—you  absolutely  could  not  make  such  a  guarantee.  Millions 
of Americans would be negatively impacted with higher fares and fewer service op-
tions,  and  many  of  those  impacted  would  be  in  cities  where  low-cost  carriers  would 
not  serve.  Fortunately,  the  Department  of  Justice’s  role  in  reviewing  a  proposed 
merger is to assess the competitive impact, and DOJ follows very specific guidelines 
based on U.S. antitrust law in conducting those reviews. DOJ will either determine 
that  the  proposal  will  not  negatively  impact  competition,  it  will  suggest  remedies 
that  would  mitigate  the  impact  on  competition  but  allow  the  proposal  to  proceed, 
or  it  will  challenge  it  on  the  grounds  that  it  will  so  negatively  impact  competition 
that  it  should  not  be  approved.  These  reviews  take  a  significant  amount  of  time 
when there are competitive issues involved, and again, in our view, it would not ap-
prove the proposed US Airways/Delta merger. 

Question  4.  I  understand  that  currently  Delta  Air  Lines  would  be  $8  billion  in 
debt  after  emerging  from  bankruptcy  if  this  merger  is  unsuccessful.  US  Airways 
claims that in order to maximize the synergies of the two companies it is necessary 
to  merge  with  Delta  prior  to  their  emerging  from  bankruptcy.  Is  it  correct  that 
under the proposed merger plan the combined debt of Delta and US Airways would 
reach $25 billion? 

And, how is the creation of a larger airline with a larger debt load going to under-
go  the  trials  associated  with  a  merging  successfully,  provide  a  quality  product  to 
their customers, and become profitable at the same time? 

Answer. In answer to your first question, yes—with US Airways increased bid, the 
total  long-term  debt  load  carried  by  the  combined  carrier  would  be  approximately 
$25 billion, which in this industry, is an absolute recipe for disaster. A merged Delta 
and  US  Airways  would  have  massive  labor  integration  and  fleet  integration  chal-
lenges, not to mention customer service issues associated with having to merge oper-
ations,  IT  systems,  frequent  flier  programs,  and  other  facets  of  the  business.  Car-
rying  that  kind  of  debt  load  would  cripple  the  new  entity,  making  it  nearly  impos-
sible  to  invest  in  any  substantial  way  in  the  product,  fleet  or  facilities  because  of 
the  need  to  service  the  interest  on  that  debt.  Any  sort  of  hiccup—whether  an  eco-
nomic  downturn,  security  scare,  labor  action—would  bring  the  new  entity  to  its 
knees. 

Question 5. Mr. Grinstein, I understand that you were on the first of many flights 
that  Delta  sent  into  the  disaster  zone  following  Hurricane  Katrina  to  bring  relief 
supplies and to help relocate stranded passengers and community members. I know

that Delta was born in Monroe and I want to thank you and your company for your 
efforts  on  behalf  of  the  State  of  Louisiana.  We  appreciate  the  loyalty  and  sense  of 
social responsibility that Delta displayed following such a monumental disaster. 

Mr.  Grinstein  and  Mr.  Parker,  I  would  like  to  know  if  the  humanitarian  efforts 
of  an  airline  would  be  hampered  through  consolidation  or  if  we  can  count  on  a 
merged US Airways and Delta to be capable of providing aid in the event of future 
disasters. 

Answer.  Senator,  thank  you.  Delta  has  a  long  and  proud  history  with  the  State 
of  Louisiana,  and  we  were  honored  to  be  able  to  provide  relief  flights  to  bring  sup-
plies to the region and ferry survivors out in the wake of Katrina. It would certainly 
be my hope that humanitarian efforts would not be hindered by industry consolida-
tion.  But,  if  a  merger  of  the  sort  proposed  by  US  Airways  with  Delta  occurred—a 
merger  which  would  significantly  weaken  the  carrier  with  an  astronomical  debt 
load,  major  labor  integration  challenges,  increased  costs  associated  with  a  more 
complicated fleet, and decimated morale—it might be difficult to provide such relief 
in the future. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

GERALD GRINSTEIN 

Question  1.  Robert  Crandall,  the  former  American  Airlines  CEO,  wrote  an  op-ed 
in  the  Wall  Street  Journal  in  December  that  lauded  consolidation  and  said  specifi-
cally  of  US  Airways’  bid  that  ‘‘any  potential  anti-competitive  effects . . . would  be 
quickly tempered by the response of these low-cost carriers.’’ Delta has asserted that 
low-cost  carriers  would  not  come  into  markets  where  both  US  Airways  and  Delta 
have a large presence. Can you respond to Mr. Crandall’s assertion and explain your 
own  view?  Which  specific  markets  would  not  be  served  by  a  low-cost  carrier  if  US 
Airways is forced to divest routes? 

Answer.  Low-cost  carriers  are  not  likely  to  save  the  day  in  the  numerous  small 
cities that are currently served by both Delta and US Airways but will be dominated 
by the new combined carrier, resulting in fare increases and reduced service options 
after  the  merger.  Air  service  to  many  of  these  small  cities  works  economically  only 
because  of  the  availability  of  small  aircraft—50  and  70  seat  regional  jets—to  serve 
them.  Low-cost  carriers  simply  don’t  have  the  equipment  or  the  business  model  to 
be  able  to  serve  these  cities  effectively.  They  fly  bigger  aircraft—like  Boeing  737s 
or Airbus 320s—and serve markets with much larger Origin and Destination traffic 
than  many  of  the  cities  that  would  be  impacted  negatively  from  this  merger.  Only 
14  of  the  127  small  communities  that  will  be  impacted  by  this  merger  currently 
have  low-cost  carrier  service.  Further,  the  recent  history  of  low-cost  carrier  expan-
sion  shows  that  impacted  small  communities  are  unlikely  to  see  relief—since  2000, 
93  percent  of  low-cost  carrier  growth  has  been  in  large  and  medium  sized  cities. 
Only  117  of  1,633  new  average  daily  departures  since  2000  have  been  in  small  or 
non-hub  airports.  Cities  impacted  specifically  by  a  Delta-US  Airways  merger  would 
likely  include:  Florence,  SC;  Huntington,  WV;  Charlottesville,  VA;  Scranton,  PA; 
Montgomery, AL; Bristol, TN; and many others. 

Question 1a. Beyond the US Airways offer, do you think consolidation is good for 

didn’t have similar route structures? 

As  I  said  earlier,  we  are  not  now  considering  or  negotiating  any  merger.  A  good 
merger  would  be  one  where  the  carriers  have  similar  cultures  and  networks  that 
complement  each  other,  rather  than  overlapping  each  other.  A  good  merger  would 

the industry or inevitable? 

Answer.  Consolidation  may  be  beneficial  at  some  point,  but  how  it  happens  and 
among  which  industry  players  are  the  critical  questions.  The  airline  industry  has 
undergone radical transformation since 9/11. By almost any measure, it is clear that 
the  industry’s  health  is  improving—traffic  has  grown  while  capacity  has  flattened, 
we are seeing record load factors, the gap between breakeven and actual load factors 
has  almost  been  eliminated,  yields  are  improving,  and  costs  are  declining.  Our 
workforces  have  shrunk  28  percent  since  9/11  (154K  jobs)  but  our  people  are  more 
productive than ever. We’ve seen pricing power return and a number of carriers op-
erate in the black in 2006. Whether consolidation is necessary to make the industry 
stable  in  the  long  term  is  arguable  at  this  point.  Critical  factors  in  healing  the  in-
dustry  include  maintaining  capacity  discipline,  network  carriers  having  worldwide 
reach  (to  be  insulated  from  regional  shocks),  and  low-cost  carriers  keeping  their 
costs  under  control.  One  thing  I  can  state  definitively  is  that  bad  consolidation— 
such  as  a  merger  between  major  competitors  with  overlapping  networks—like  US– 
DL—would harm the industry immeasurably. 

Question  1b.  Would  you  be  more  receptive  to  this  offer  if  US  Airways  and  Delta 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 29, 2010 Jkt 035684 PO 00000 Frm 00109 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\35684.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

106 

be  one  where  each  partner  brings  unique  strengths  to  the  table  and  adds  value  by 
increasing  the  other’s  reach  globally.  Even  at  that,  I  firmly  believe  that  airline 
mergers are very difficult to execute, and even the good ones carry significant chal-
lenges with them. The U.S. industry is just now entering a period of renewed health 
and  pricing  power—engaging  in  any  merger  before  U.S.  carriers  are  consistently 
healthy would be unwise. 

Question  2.  Delta’s  Board  of  Directors  rejected  US  Airways’  offer  in  December. 
However,  Delta’s  creditors  and  a  bankruptcy  court  may  decide  that  US  Airways’ 
offer  is  better  than  your  own  reorganization  plan  and  approve  it.  The  Departments 
of  Justice  and  Transportation  may  then  decide  that  it  doesn’t  reduce  competition 
and allow it to proceed as long as US Airways divests certain routes. Why shouldn’t 
this merger go through if those parties conclude that competition won’t be reduced? 
Answer. Even with significant divestiture—which would significantly diminish the 
value  of  this  proposed  merger—the  Department  of  Justice  will  still  be  highly  likely 
to conclude that this merger is anticompetitive and it would not approve it. By every 
measure,  the  overlap  between  Delta  and  US  Airways’  networks  is  more  significant 
and  this  proposed  merger  is  more  anticompetitive  than  the  proposed  US  Airways/ 
United  Airlines  merger,  which  DOJ  deemed  anticompetitive  and  decided  to  chal-
lenge after 18 months of review. Regardless, the U.S. industry is just now entering 
a  period  of  renewed  health  and  pricing  power—engaging  in  any  merger  before  U.S. 
carriers are consistently healthy would be unwise.

Question.  Delta  has  a  reservations  center  in  Tampa,  along  with  flight  attendant 
and maintenance bases at Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. What is your view 
of  the  impact  of  a  merger  with  US  Airways  on  the  employees  that  work  at  these 
locations? 

Answer.  Delta  employs  almost  5,000  people  in  the  State  of  Florida.  US  Airways’ 
business plan calls for elimination of 10 percent of Delta and US Airways’ combined 
capacity,  which  will  mean  the  immediate  elimination  of  nearly  200  aircraft  and 
10,000 jobs. Mr. Parker has stated repeatedly that the merger needs to be executed 
before  Delta  exits  bankruptcy.  This  is  because  it  is  so  much  easier  to  reject  leases 
and contracts while in bankruptcy, and because many of the ‘‘synergies’’ US Airways 
plans  to  achieve  will  come  about  through  those  rejections.  With  that  in  mind,  it  is 
very  conceivable  that  the  reservations  center,  and  flight  attendant  and  mechanics 
bases, could be downsized dramatically if not eliminated in their entirety.

Question 1. Labor costs are one of the highest costs for air carriers. Is it an unfair 
competitive  advantage  for  airlines  to  be  required  to  fully  fund  their  employee  pen-
sion  plans  while  others  are  relieved  of  pension  obligations  through  bankruptcy  or 
other procedures? 

Answer.  Bankruptcy  laws  were  enacted  by  Congress  to  permit  companies  to  re-
structure  their  outstanding  financial  obligations—which  can  include  pension,  em-
ployee  and  vendor  contracts,  facilities  and  equipment  leases  and  others—according 
to  legal  standards  that  are  applied  by  bankruptcy  courts.  Where  a  choice  must  be 
made  between  requiring  an  airline  to  meet  all  of  its  outstanding  financial  obliga-
tions  and  liquidating  that  airline,  a  bankruptcy  court  decides  whether  meeting  its 
obligation  will  permit  or  prohibit  it  from  restructuring  successfully  and  emerging 
from  bankruptcy.  In  many  cases  in  the  last  couple  of  decades,  including  those  of 
Continental, US Airways, United, and even Delta’s pilot plan, the bankruptcy courts 
have  ruled  that  pension  plans  must  be  terminated  or  the  airlines  would  liquidate, 
taking  with  them  the  jobs,  service,  and  other  economic  benefit  they  drive.  It  is  not 
for  me  to  decide  whether  all  of  those  courts’  decisions  were  fair.  What  I  will  say 
is  that  a  company  should  do  everything  it  can  to  meet  its  pension  obligations.  In 
Delta’s case, we froze our pilot and non-pilot plans so that they would not generate 
additional liability after they were frozen. Because of the pilot plan’s lump sum fea-
ture however, the bankruptcy court determined that Delta could not survive without 
terminating  that  plan.  We  implemented  a  defined-contribution  plan  for  our  pilots 
that features a significant Delta contribution, and will provide a replacement retire-
ment  plan  for  our  non-pilot  employees.  We  also  led  a  two  and  a  half  year  battle  to 
include  alternative  funding  schedules  for  airlines  in  pension  reform  legislation  that

has  enabled  us  to  save  the  previously  earned  benefits  of  our  91,000  of  active  and 
retired non-pilot employees. 

107 

Question  2.  Since  December  31,  2004,  what  is  the  total  amount  of  bonuses  paid 

to your management team? 

Answer. None. 
Question 3. Do you have any plans for restoring terminated employee pension pro-

grams at a future date, after the company emerges from bankruptcy? 

Answer.  Delta  sponsored  two  primary  defined  benefit  pension  plans  for  our  em-
ployees—one  for  pilots  and  one  for  non-pilots.  Delta  was  able,  through  enactment 
of  the  Pension  Reform  Act  signed  into  law  last  year,  to  save  the  previously-earned 
pension benefits of our 91,000 active and retired non-pilot employees, so no plan res-
toration is necessary. Delta’s pilot plan was partially frozen in 2004, a new defined 
contribution  plan  was  introduced  at  that  time,  and  that  defined  contribution  plan 
continues  to  provide  active  Delta  pilots  with  a  competitive  pension  plan.  Because 
the  Pension  Reform  Act  provided  no  relief  from  the  unaffordable  costs  resulting 
from  the  pilot  defined  benefit  plan’s  lump  sum  feature—expected  to  exceed  more 
than  $1  billion  in  the  near  term  alone—the  bankruptcy  court  and  the  PBGC  ap-
proved  termination  of  that  plan  in  late  2006,  in  essence  concluding  that  its  termi-
nation was necessary for Delta to survive. Delta agreed to pay the PBGC very sub-
stantial additional value to assist the PBGC in meeting the unfunded liability of the 
pilot  plan,  and  as  such,  does  not  plan  to  restore  that  plan.  PBGC  has  also  waived 
its right to call for restoration of the Delta pilot pension plan. The company has esti-
mated  that  even  with  the  termination  of  the  pilot  plan,  current  Delta  pilot  retirees 
will  receive  on  average  approximately  $75,200  in  annualized  pension  benefits,  in-
cluding the value of lump sum benefits received.

Question 1. Six years ago, this Committee held hearings on the then-wave of air-
line  consolidation  and  the  proposed  United-US  Airways  merger,  which  was  ulti-
mately challenged by the Department of Justice and several state attorneys general. 
Some argue that the landscape has changed since that time, in particular the emer-
gence  and  predominance  of  low-cost  carriers  today.  I  would  like  to  hear  your  per-
spective  on  how  things  have  changed  and  whether  those  changes  mean  much  for 
a proposed merger of two airlines like Delta and US Airways with significantly over-
lapping route networks. 

Answer. What is key here is that whatever has happened to the airline industry, 
the  law  hasn’t  changed.  DOJ  still  applies  antitrust  law  as  it  has  done  since  it  op-
posed  the  2000  UA/US  Air  merger.  It  cannot  ignore  its  own  merger  guidelines, 
which  look  at  impact  on  city-pair  competition,  impact  on  business  travel,  and  re-
gional  concentration.  The  industry  has  changed,  of  course.  Low-cost  carriers  are  a 
much larger part of the airline industry today than they have been in the past. They 
are  profitable,  although  that  is  changing;  they  are  very  competitive,  and  they  have 
increased  their  market  share  by  67  percent.  However,  they  have  not  expanded  into 
small and non-hub communities—those which would be most significantly and nega-
tively  impacted  by  a  US/DL  merger—nor  will  they  expand  into  those  markets  be-
cause  of  their  fleet  types  and  their  business  models.  LCCs  generally  serve  markets 
with  at  least  500K  originating  passengers  per  year.  Over  100  of  the  cities  that  will 
see  reduced  competition  and  higher  fares  from  a  US–DL  merger  do  not  have  now, 
and  are  not  likely  to  get  an  LCC.  Furthermore,  as  an  Aviation  Daily  article  from 
last week examined, the lines are blurring between network airlines and LCCs. LCC 
costs are rising and profits shrinking, while network carriers have changed dramati-
cally  since  9/11  to  survive  head-to-head  competition  with  LCC’s.  I  would  not,  if  I 
were  a  passenger  in  Pasco,  WA  or  Salina,  KS,  want  to  rely  on  their  expansion  into 
my community for relief from a new monopoly. 

Question 2. Should this offer be accepted and approved by the Department of Jus-

tice, who are the ‘‘winners’’ and ‘‘losers?’’ 

Answer.  The  biggest  losers  would  be,  by  far,  the  passengers  Delta  and  US  Air-
ways  currently  serve  in  small  communities,  as  they  would  see  increased  fares  and 
reduced  service  options,  and  have  little  hope  of  being  rescued  by  a  low-cost  carrier. 
Our  employee  workforce  would  be  dramatically  harmed  as  they  would  face  the  loss 
of at least 10,000 jobs and the reversal of all their hard work and sacrifice over the 
last  few  years—the  new  carrier  would  struggle  to  integrate  union  and  non-union 
workforces  and  cultures,  it  would  see  a  staggering  debt  load,  an  incredibly  complex 
fleet,  and  diminished  salaries  and  revenues.  Winners—short-term  speculators  on

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

W. DOUGLAS PARKER 

Question  1.  It  is  a  significant  concern  of  mine  that  any  consolidation  in  the  air 
line industry does not adversely affect the air line customer in our smaller commu-
nities.  With  a  number  of  smaller  communities’  airports  already  suffering  from  high 
ticket  costs  and  a  lack  of  flight  options,  how  will  the  continued  consolidation  of  the 
industry affect these communities in the future? And in particular how will the pro-
posed  merger  between  US  Airways  and  Delta  affect  the  small  communities  in  Lou-
isiana? 

Answer.  On  January  31,  US  Airways  withdrew  its  offer  to  merge  with  Delta  Air 
Lines.  US  Airways  was  informed  that  Delta’s  Official  Unsecured  Creditors’  Com-
mittee  would  not  meet  our  demands  by  the  February  1,  2007  deadline  we  had  pre-
viously established. US Airways’ offer of $5.0 billion in cash and 89.5 million shares 
of US Airways stock would have expired on February 1st, unless there was affirma-
tive  support  from  the  Official  Unsecured  Creditors’  Committee  for  commencement 
of  due  diligence,  making  the  required  Department  of  Justice  filings  under  Hart- 
Scott-Rodino, as well as the postponement of Delta’s hearing on its Disclosure State-
ment scheduled for February 7, 2007. 

I pledged repeatedly on behalf of US Airways that, had the proposed merger gone 
forward, all existing U.S. destinations served today by US Airways and Delta would 
have  remained  part  of  the  new,  improved  network.  The  ‘‘New’’  Delta  would  have 
provided  communities  served  by  both  carriers  with  access  to  a  wider  range  of  net-
work options. Furthermore, consumers would have benefited from our low fare busi-
ness  philosophy.  As  your  question  expressly  indicates,  service  to  smaller  commu-
nities in Louisiana today is limited and costly. We had hoped to help address those 
very concerns with the merged company we sought to create. 

Question  2.  Delta  Air  Lines  employs  over  400  people  in  Louisiana  and  has  had 
a  long  and  distinguished  history  in  my  home  state  from  it’s  inception  in  Monroe, 
Louisiana in 1928. I am concerned that the further consolidation of the industry will 
lead  to  many  of  these  people  losing  their  livelihoods.  How  is  the  industry  going  to 
consolidate  and  reduce  fleet  capability  to  remain  profitable  while  not  dismissing  a 
good number of their employees? 

Answer.  Again,  the  US  Airways  proposal  to  merge  with  Delta  was  withdrawn  on 
January 31. I pledged repeatedly on behalf of US Airways that no frontline employ-
ees of either airline would have lost their jobs involuntarily as a result of the merg-
er.  Further,  all  employees  within  individual  work  groups  would  have  been  moved 
to  the  higher  existing  labor  cost  of  either  airline.  Those  commitments  would  have 
been kept had the merger gone forward. 

Question  3.  As  the  air  line  industry  continues  to  consolidate  it  is  inevitable  that 
anti-trust  concerns  arise.  In  the  case  where  the  proposed  mergers  would  result  in 
the creation of a ‘‘mega-carrier’’ with a significant percentage of the domestic market 
under their control, how can we ensure that the consolidation of this carrier’s over-
lapping  route  structure  will  not  result  in  a  lack  of  competition  that  will  negatively 
affect the American traveler, especially in relation to low volume flight routes where 
low-cost  carriers  are  not  likely  to  enter  into  competition  with  the  larger  airlines? 
Answer.  Had  our  proposal  to  merge  with  Delta  Air  Lines  gone  forward,  the  De-
partment  of  Justice  would  have  conducted  a  full  and  thorough  evaluation  of  the 
transaction to ensure that the benefits to consumers would have outweighed any po-
tential  negative  impact.  Ample  and  adequate  authority  is  vested  in  DOJ  under  the 
time-tested laws in place for evaluating business transactions such as our proposal. 
We  are  confident  that  DOJ  would  have  exercised  its  lawful  authority  in  the  best 
interests  of  the  American  traveler.  We,  of  course,  were  confident  that  our  proposal 
would  have  passed  muster  with  the  Department  of  Justice  and  that  consumers 
would have, in fact, benefited from a merger between US Airways and Delta. 

Question  4.  I  understand  that  currently  Delta  Air  Lines  would  be  $8  billion  in 
debt  after  emerging  from  bankruptcy  if  this  merger  is  unsuccessful.  US  Airways 
claims that in order to maximize the synergies of the two companies it is necessary 
to  merge  with  Delta  prior  to  their  emerging  from  bankruptcy.  Is  it  correct  that 
under the proposed merger plan the combined debt of Delta and US Airways would 
reach $25 billion?

And, how is the creation of a larger airline with a larger debt load going to under-
go  the  trials  associated  with  a  merging  successfully,  provide  a  quality  product  to 
their customers, and become profitable at the same time? 

Answer.  A  merger  between  US  Airways  and  Delta  would  have  created  a  signifi-
cantly  larger  airline  with  much  greater  capacity  to  generate  revenue.  An  absolute 
level  of  debt  is  not  a  particularly  meaningful  number  in  and  of  itself.  For  example, 
General Electric has $400 billion of debt. Yet General Electric is an enormous com-
pany  that  has  enormous  profits.  What  matters  is  whether  a  company  can  service 
the debt. It is revealing to note that those willing to provide the financing necessary 
to pursue our proposed merger with Delta were clearly unconcerned about the abso-
lute level of debt. 

Question 5. Mr. Grinstein, I understand that you were on the first of many flights 
that  Delta  sent  into  the  disaster  zone  following  Hurricane  Katrina  to  bring  relief 
supplies and to help relocate stranded passengers and community members. I know 
that Delta was born in Monroe and I want to thank you and your company for your 
efforts  on  behalf  of  the  State  of  Louisiana.  We  appreciate  the  loyalty  and  sense  of 
social responsibility that Delta displayed following such a monumental disaster. 

Mr.  Grinstein  and  Mr.  Parker,  I  would  like  to  know  if  the  humanitarian  efforts 
of  an  airline  would  be  hampered  through  consolidation  or  if  we  can  count  on  a 
merged US Airways and Delta to be capable of providing aid in the event of future 
disasters. 

Answer.  I  trust  you  are  aware  that  Delta  was  not  alone  in  providing  aid  to  your 
constituents  in  the  wake  of  Hurricane  Katrina.  The  relief  effort  mounted  coopera-
tively by the Nation’s airlines occurred just prior to the consummation of the merger 
between  America  West  Airlines  and  the  old  US  Airways.  Both  companies—US  Air-
ways  and  America  West—participated  significantly  in  that  effort,  as  did  virtually 
every other major airline. As the communities we serve will no doubt attest, the new 
US  Airways  is  a  solid  corporate  citizen,  contributing  many  thousands  of  dollars  in 
cash,  goods,  and  services  to  many,  many  causes  worthy  of  support.  Likewise,  our 
employees  donate  countless  hours  of  their  own  time  in  the  service  of  community 
causes. You need not be concerned that a merged US Airways and Delta would have 
been any less willing or able to engage in the kind of humanitarian efforts brought 
to bear by the Nation’s airlines to assist the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

W. DOUGLAS PARKER 

Question 1. You have been a strong advocate for consolidation in the airline indus-
try. Yet, according to the GAO, the new US Airways-America West has only cut its 
fleet  by  10  percent.  It  also  continues  to  operate  as  two  separate  airlines  for  all  in-
tents  and  purposes.  At  the  same  time,  you  have  promised  not  to  eliminate  jobs  or 
cut  service  if  the  government  approves  your  bid  to  acquire  Delta.  If,  as  you  argue, 
the  industry  needs  to  consolidate,  shouldn’t  there  be  a  real  downsizing  that  results 
in fewer costs? 

Question 1a. What benefit does your merging with Delta have for the industry be-
yond  acquiring  a  competitor  if  you  don’t  plan  on  significantly  reducing  overhead 
costs or selling a significant amount of infrastructure? 

Question 1b.For instance, you have promised $1.65 billion in savings, but the com-
bined  debt  of  the  new  airline  would  be  $24  billion,  more  than  the  combined  debt 
of both airlines currently. That certainly offsets any cost savings. Wouldn’t you need 
to cut costs more than $1.65 billion to make this deal work? 

Question 1c. How do you intend to pay down the estimated $24 billion in debt that 

the new airline would owe? 

Question  1d.  If  the  Department  of  Justice  approves  the  deal,  isn’t  it  likely  that 
you will be forced to divest routes and assets which would force you to make layoffs? 
How can you promise not to cut jobs this early in the process? 

Answer.  On  January  31,  US  Airways  withdrew  its  offer  to  merge  with  Delta  Air 
Lines.  US  Airways  was  informed  that  Delta’s  Official  Unsecured  Creditors’  Com-
mittee  would  not  meet  our  demands  by  the  February  1,  2007  deadline  we  had  pre-

Question 1. Competition is the key here; more carriers competing on a route gives 
travelers more choices, which keeps costs down. It’s my understanding that the pro-
posed  merger  would  give  the  new  airline  a  90  percent  share  of  travelers  from  Flor-
ida  cities  to  370  locations  around  the  globe.  Can  you  explain  how  that  would  not 
result in higher costs for Floridians? 

Answer.  On  January  31,  US  Airways  withdrew  its  offer  to  merge  with  Delta  Air 
Lines.  US  Airways  was  informed  that  Delta’s  Official  Unsecured  Creditors’  Com-
mittee  would  not  meet  our  demands  by  the  February  1,  2007  deadline  we  had  pre-

of  due  diligence,  making  the  required  Department  of  Justice  filings  under  Hart- 
Scott-Rodino, as well as the postponement of Delta’s hearing on its Disclosure State-
ment scheduled for February 7, 2007. 

Had  our  proposal  to  merge  with  Delta  Air  Lines  gone  forward,  the  Department 
of  Justice  would  have  conducted  a  full  and  thorough  evaluation  of  the  transaction 
to ensure that the benefits to consumers would have outweighed any potential nega-
tive  impact.  Ample  and  adequate  authority  is  vested  in  DOJ  under  the  time-tested 
laws in place for evaluating business transactions such as our proposal. We are con-
fident  that  DOJ  would  have  exercised  its  lawful  authority  in  the  best  interests  of 
the  American  traveler.  We,  of  course,  were  confident  that  our  proposal  would  have 
passed  muster  with  the  Department  of  Justice  and  that  consumers  would  have,  in 
fact, benefited from a merger between US Airways and Delta. 

Question 2. You’ve said cost savings could come from cutting ‘‘marginal capacity,’’ 
but  what  guarantee  can  you  give  that  you  won’t  simply  cut  from  an  entire  region? 
My rural constituents (Pensacola, Tallahassee, Panama City) don’t have a whole lot 
of choices to begin with. 

Answer.  Again,  the  US  Airways  proposal  to  merge  with  Delta  was  withdrawn  on 
January  31.  I  pledged  repeatedly  on  behalf  of  US  Airways  that,  had  the  proposed 
merger gone forward, all existing U.S. destinations served today by US Airways and 
Delta  would  have  remained  part  of  the  new,  improved  network.  The  ‘‘New’’  Delta

range  of  network  options.  Furthermore,  consumers  would  have  benefited  from  our 
low fare business philosophy. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO

Question 1. Labor costs are one of the highest costs for air carriers. Is it an unfair 
competitive  advantage  for  airlines  to  be  required  to  fully  fund  their  employee  pen-
sion  plans  while  others  are  relieved  of  pension  obligations  through  bankruptcy  or 
other procedures? 

Answer.  Through  the  bankruptcy  proceeding  and  as  a  result  of  laws  sought  by 
Delta and passed last year by the U.S. Congress, Delta Air Lines has been substan-
tially relieved of its pre-bankruptcy pension obligations. Lawfully achieved, we don’t 
know  of  any  reason  why  pension  relief  is  any  more  unfair  for  one  airline  than  for 
another. 

Had  the  former  US  Airways  not  been  lawfully  relieved  of  pension  obligations 
through  bankruptcy,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  America  West  Airlines  would  have 
sought to merge with the company. At the time of that merger, the former US Air-
ways  was  in  serious  financial  distress.  Had  the  America  West/US  Airways  merger 
not gone forward, it is virtually a certainty that many thousands of former US Air-
ways employees would have lost their jobs. 

Question  2.  If  the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  requires  US  Airways  to 
restore its pension programs to pre-termination status, how will this affect US Air-
ways’ ability to compete in the airline industry? 

Answer.  We  do  not  believe  the  PBGC  will  seek  to  impose  pension  obligations  of 
the former US Airways on the newly formed company resulting from the merger of 
America  West  Airlines  and  the  old  US  Airways.  Should  the  agency  attempt  to  do 
so, we do not believe it would ultimately succeed under existing law.

Question  1.  You  have  stated  that  a  merged  US  Airways  and  Delta  would  reduce 
available seat miles by 10 percent while increasing revenues per available seat mile 
3.5 percent. Does this mean fewer seats at higher prices? 

Question 2. US Airways has hubs in Charlotte, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, 
and  Las  Vegas,  while  Delta  has  hubs  in  Atlanta,  Cincinnati,  Dallas/Ft.  Worth,  and 
Salt  Lake  City.  The  Charlotte  and  Atlanta  hubs  have  very  similar  overlays.  There 
have  been  reports  that  with  a  US  Airways/Delta  merger,  the  Charlotte  hub  could 
see  as  much  as  a  50  percent  reduction  in  flights.  What  do  you  plan  to  do  with  the 
Charlotte/Atlanta hubs? 

Question 3. The Department of Justice is expected to look at cities served and city 
pairs  served  to  determine  whether  the  proposed  merger  will  substantially  increase 
market  concentration  and  decrease  competition.  US  Airways  and  Delta  serve  many 
of  the  same  destinations,  especially  along  the  East  Coast  and  South.  It  has  been 
reported  that  a  merged  airline  would  be  the  largest  airline  in  155  of  350  airports 
served.  It  has  also  been  reported  that  the  merger  would  result  in  over  2,000  city 
pairs where the combined airline would have a 90 percent market share. Should the 
merger  occur,  how  will  the  combined  city  pairs  impact  airports  like  LIT  and  XNA 
in  Arkansas,  which  are  currently  served  by  both  airlines—can  consumers  expect  a 
reduction in flights, fewer destinations, a decrease in service or increased fares? 

Answer to Questions 1–3. On January 31, US Airways withdrew its offer to merge 
with  Delta  Air  Lines.  US  Airways  was  informed  that  Delta’s  Official  Unsecured 
Creditors’  Committee  would  not  meet  our  demands  by  the  February  1,  2007  dead-
line we had previously established. US Airways’ offer of $5.0 billion in cash and 89.5 
million  shares  of  US  Airways  stock  would  have  expired  on  February  1st,  unless 
there was affirmative support from the Official Unsecured Creditors’ Committee for 
commencement  of  due  diligence,  making  the  required  Department  of  Justice  filings 
under Hart-Scott-Rodino, as well as the postponement of Delta’s hearing on its Dis-
closure Statement scheduled for February 7, 2007.

Question 1. Can you give me an overview of how US Airways has worked to inte-

grate your America West members since the merger? 

Answer.  The  Machinists  Union  and  US  Airways  began  integration/transition  ne-
gotiations  immediately  after  the  National  Mediation  Board  certified  the  Machinists 
as  the  collective  bargaining  representative  for  the  combined  airline’s  15,000  Fleet 
Service Workers (May 11, 2006) and Mechanic & Related and Maintenance Training 
Specialist employees (August 11, 2006). The goal of these negotiations is to integrate 
workers from both airlines under a single agreement and seniority list for each clas-
sification.  Currently,  former  America  West  employees  work  under  collective  bar-
gaining  agreements  negotiated  by  their  former  unions  while  US  Airways  workers 
in these classifications work under Machinist Union contracts. Employees doing the 
same job for the same company have different work rules, wages and benefits, which 
is divisive and inefficient. US Airways has failed to negotiate in good faith to reach 
an agreement. Meanwhile, the airline’s CEO and other top management officials re-
ceive  generous  bonuses  and  stock  as  a  reward  for  delaying  negotiations  and  pre-
venting employees from receiving benefits from the merger. 

Question  2.  Assuming  that  Delta’s  creditors  approved  the  US  Airways’  offer,  and 
based  on  your  experience  with  US  Airways,  do  you  believe  that  layoffs  are  inevi-
table? 

It  is  my  opinion  that  a  merger  the  size  of  the  once-contemplated  US  Airways/ 

Delta merger could not be accomplished without major layoffs.

Question.  Labor  costs  are  one  of  the  highest  costs  for  air  carriers.  Is  it  an  unfair 
competitive  advantage  for  airlines  to  be  required  to  fully  fund  their  employee  pen-
sion  plans  while  others  are  relieved  of  pension  obligations  through  bankruptcy  or 
other procedures? 

Answer.  Bankruptcy  makes  it  too  easy  for  airlines  to  shed  pension  obligations. 
Airlines  should  work  with  their  unions  to  develop  creative  solutions  to  address  a

pension  shortfall  before  it  becomes  a  critical  issue.  The  Machinists  Union  advised 
United  Airlines  in  2000,  5  years  before  they  terminated  their  pensions,  that  our 
analysis  showed  they  were  headed  for  a  major  pension  funding  problem.  The  Ma-
chinists  Union  offered  solutions,  such  as  freezing  the  company  sponsored  plan  at 
that  time  and  transitioning  into  the  IAM’s  multi-employer  National  Pension  Plan. 
United refused, and the IAM’s predictions came true. Following the terminations of 
the  company  sponsored  plans,  United’s  IAM  members  now  participate  in  the  IAM 
National Pension Plan. Unfortunately, United’s refusal to address the problems ear-
lier cost its employees dearly because of the loss of promised benefits.

Question. Should the Department of Justice allow this merger, would this lead to 
other  mergers  among  other  ‘‘legacy-carriers’’  in  the  industry?  What  impact  might 
this have on labor? 

Answer.  Although  this  merger  offer  has  been  withdrawn,  the  danger  of  other 
mergers  still  linger.  I  believe  that  if  any  two  legacy  carriers  merge  it  will  ignite  a 
frenzy  for  the  others  to  pair  up  or  be  left  at  a  competitive  disadvantage.  Airline 
mega-mergers  are  designed  to  reduce  redundancies,  and  that  means  a  loss  of  jobs. 
Thousands  of  TWA  workers  are  still  out  of  work  following  its  2001  merger  with 
American Airlines. The mergers being contemplated today would lead to even great-
er job loss.

Since the merger proposal was obviously based entirely on a US Airways scheme 
to use bankruptcy to abrogate contracts and the anticompetitive nature of the merg-
er was make overwhelmingly clear at the hearing and elsewhere, most of the ques-
tions are moot. 

Question 1. In your written testimony, you state that the US Airways/Delta merg-
er  will  ‘‘have  substantial  anti-competitive  effects  that  will  be  impossible  to  amelio-
rate with traditional anti-trust authorities,’’ and that ‘‘the spin-off of some assets to 
repair  the  competitive  harm  in  the  markets  would  occur  in  city  pairs  that  are  al-
ready  insufficiently  competitive.’’  Can  you  give  me  an  example  of  a  divestiture  that 
US  Airways  would  be  forced  to  make  that  would  not  attract  a  new  carrier  and 
would result in less competition in that market? 

Answer. I have no specific example in mind. 
Question 2. Why would traditional anti-trust authority fail to ensure competition? 
Answer.  Because  they  have  been  captured  by  the  theory  of  efficiency  at  the  ex-
pense of competition and have been asleep at the switch for the better part of a dec-
ade. 

Question  3.  Can  you  give  me  examples  of  markets  that  both  US  Airways  and 

Delta serve that are insufficiently competitive? 

Answer.  All  of  the  routes  served  by  2,  3,  or  4  are  certainly  not  sufficiently  com-

petitive. The 5 and 6 carrier routes are also a source of concern. 

Question  4.  How  many  markets  would  experience  a  decline  in  competition  if  this 

merger is approved? 

Answer. The best count I saw was 1,000 to 2,000 routes. 
Question  5.  Have  you  reviewed  US  Airways  ticket  prices  since  it  merged  with 

America West? Have they increased, and if so, where? 

Answer.  I  have  not  reviewed  their  prices  specifically.  However,  I  believe  there 

have been industry-wide price increases. 

Question 6. Is there a historical example that you can give of two airlines in simi-
lar size and route structure to US Airways and Delta that resulted in higher fares? 
Answer.  The  history  of  the  mergers  outlined  in  my  testimony  shows  a  pattern  of 
price  increases.  The  closest  similar  proposed  merger—US  Airways/  United,  was  op-
posed by the Department of Justice. 

Question 7. Can you list any small markets that aren’t served by low-cost carriers 

that would see a decrease in competition if the merger is approved? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  most  of  the  1,000  to  2,000  routes  that  involve  a  2-to-1  or 
3-to-2  merger  fall  into  this  category,  as  the  low-cost  airlines  tend  to  serve  much 
higher volume routes.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

DR. MARK N. COOPER 

Question.  The  skies  have  been  pretty  bumpy  for  airlines  in  recent  years.  The  Air 
Transportation  Stabilization  Board  (ATSB)  guaranteed  billions  in  loans  and  pen-
sions  have  been  dumped  on  the  PBGC.  This  essentially  means  the  merger  is  being 
funded by the taxpayers. And with a ‘‘new Delta’’ looking to end up with $23 billion 
in  debt—up  from  the  $10  billion  Delta  would  hold  coming  out  of  bankruptcy.  What 
kind  of  stability  concerns  does  that  raise?  Are  there  any  indications  that  taxpayers 
would  end  up  bailing  out  a  ‘‘new  Delta’’  on  a  grander  scale  than  we’ve  already  had 
to do? 

Answer.  We  opposed  the  lavish  bailout  of  the  industry  last  time.  Delta  has  done 
a  good  job  of  lowering  its  costs  without  abandoning  its  social  responsibilities.  I 
would assume that a second loan would not be forthcoming if Delta again gets into 
trouble.
