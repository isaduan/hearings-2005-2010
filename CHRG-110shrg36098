RENOMINATION  OF  CHARLES  D.  SNELLING 
TO  BE  A  MEMBER  OF  THE  METROPOLITAN 
WASHINGTON  AIRPORTS  AUTHORITY 

THURSDAY,  MAY  24,  2007

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:04  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Today  we  will  consider  the  nomination  of  Mr. 
Charles  D.  Snelling  to  be  a  Member  of  the  Metropolitan  Wash-
ington Airports Authority. 

Mr. Snelling has come before us previously and serves on the Au-
thority  today.  By  all  accounts,  Mr.  Snelling  has  been  regarded  as 
highly  competent  and  effective  during  his  tenure  with  the  Metro-
politan Washington Airports Authority. 

I look forward to hearing about your experiences working on the 
Authority  and  any  views  you  may  have  about  how  Congress  can 
help ensure the success of the mission of the Authority. 

Mr. Snelling? 
Mr. SNELLING. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. It may please you to know that we have received 
no objection. It seems like everyone loves you, and they approve of 
you, or at least——
STATEMENT  OF  HON.  CHARLES  DARWIN  SNELLING,  RENOMI-
NATED  TO  BE  A  MEMBER  OF  THE  METROPOLITAN  WASH-
INGTON AIRPORTS AUTHORITY 
Mr.  SNELLING.  It  does  please  me  to  know  that,  Mr.  Chairman. 
And  I  thank  you  very  much  for  that  warm  and  fine  invitation. 
It’s—I’m  coming  here  often  enough  so  I’m  beginning  to  feel  com-
fortable. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. SNELLING. I am Charles Snelling, the President’s nominee to 
a second term as Member of the Metropolitan Washington Airports 
Authority  Board  of  Directors.  I  am  delighted  to  appear  before  you 
again. 

I was here last September, in 2006, in a hearing on my nomina-
tion  to  this  same  position.  Although  the  Committee  reported  my

nomination  unanimously,  the  Senate  did  not  act  on  its  report,  and 
the President nominated me again in January. 

The President appoints three directors of the Airports Authority, 
and the three of us are proud to be amongst the most active mem-
bers  of  this  13-member  board.  We  each  chair  a  Committee  that 
meets  monthly.  For  2  years,  I  served  as  Chairman  of  the  Finance 
Committee,  and  I’ve  recently  been  named  Chairman  of  the  new 
Planning and Construction Committee. 

As I have advised this Committee before, my prior experience on 
the  board  at  Lehigh  Valley  Hospital,  a  billion-dollar  charity,  has 
proved most helpful training for my service to the Airports Author-
ity. 

Mr.  Chairman,  as  most  Senators  use  our  airports,  I  think  it’s 
useful to mention briefly the major issues which are pressing on us: 
First,  as  you  may  be  aware,  the  Airports  Authority  is  about  to 
assume  the  responsibility  for  the  construction  of  the  Metrorail  ex-
tension  that  will  connect  the  entire  region  with  Dulles  Airport,  a 
project we will finance, in large part, with tolls from the Dulles Toll 
Road. We have been engaged in difficult negotiations over the price 
of  the  rail  project,  but  have  managed  to  agree  on  a  contract  that 
sets  the  price  within  the  Federal  Transit  Administration  efficiency 
standards. It now appears that we will soon be engaged in rail con-
struction  at  the  same  time  as  airport  construction.  We  relish  the 
challenge. 

On the aviation side, our efforts are both to attract new services 
and  to  make  sure  our  facilities  are  ready  to  handle  the  continuing 
growth.  At  Dulles,  as  you  know,  we’re  building  an  underground 
people mover, and the project is on schedule, and the trains should 
start running in 2009. 

We will continue to build out our master plan with an extension 
to  the  existing  midfield  terminals  and  the  ultimate  construction  of 
parallel  midfield  terminals.  Those  new  midfield  terminals  are  still 
off  in  the  future,  but  I’m  confident  that  they  will  be  built  sooner 
than anyone might expect. 

At Reagan National, we’re scrambling to build additional parking 
capacity to accommodate passenger growth caused by flights added 
over  the  last  several  years.  As  you  may  know,  our  garages  are 
often full on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. 

Traffic  has  been  growing  steadily  at  Reagan  National,  at  18.5 
million for the last 12 months, up 2.4 percent over the same period 
last  year.  At  Dulles,  there  was  a  little  decline  for  the  same  12-
month  period,  reflecting  the  sudden  demise  of  Independence  Air. 
But  Dulles  has,  in  fact,  fully  recovered.  The  month  of  March  2007 
showed a 13.7-percent growth over March in 2006. Our anticipation 
is  that  the  number  of  Dulles  passengers  will  continue  to  grow 
smartly.  Total  passengers  for  the  12-month  period  were  23.6  mil-
lion. 

More  interesting  than  the  numbers  are  the  new  services  being 
introduced at Dulles. Thus far in 2007, we have new daily services 
to  Beijing,  Rome,  Huntsville,  and  additional  flights  to  Seoul  and 
London.  As  the  year  goes  on,  we  will  have  new  service  to  Madrid, 
Panama  City,  Doha,  Dublin,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  Oklahoma  City. 
Flights  to  Addis  Ababa  will  double  to  four  per  week.  Washington’s 
air service is matching its significance as a world-class capital city.

Mr.  Chairman,  it’s  just  over  20  years  since  Congress  agreed  to 
turn  over  Dulles  and  National,  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Air-
ports,  to  the  independent  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Au-
thority. In my opinion, this has proved to be a most wise and bene-
ficial  decision.  I  look  forward  to  continuing  the  Authority’s  excel-
lent  record  as  we  face  the  future,  dealing  with  the  ever-changing 
aviation world. 

Thank  you  for  considering  my  nomination  to  the  board  of  the 
Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Authority.  I’d  be  very  happy  to 
answer any questions you might have, sir. 

[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Mr. 

Snelling follow:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES DARWIN SNELLING, RENOMINATED TO BE A 

MEMBER OF THE METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON AIRPORTS AUTHORITY 

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: 
I  am  Charles  Snelling,  the  President’s  nominee  to  a  second  term  as  a  Member  of 
the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board of Directors. I am delighted 
to appear before you again. 

I  was  last  here  in  September  2006,  in  a  hearing  on  my  nomination  to  the  same 
position. Although the Committee reported my nomination unanimously, the Senate 
did not act on its report, and the President nominated me again in January. 

The  President  appoints  three  Directors  of  the  Airports  Authority,  and  the  three 
of us are proud to be among the most active members of the 13-member Board. We 
each  chair  a  Committee  that  meets  monthly.  For  2  years,  I  served  as  Chairman  of 
the Finance Committee, and have recently been named Chairman of a new Planning 
and Construction Committee. As I have advised this Committee before, my prior ex-
perience  on  the  Board  of  the  Lehigh  Valley  Hospital,  a  billion-dollar  charity,  has 
proven most helpful training for my service on the Airports Authority. 

Mr.  Chairman,  as  most  Senators  use  our  Airports,  I  think  it  useful  to  mention

ture, but I am confident they will be built sooner than anyone now expects.

I  have  written  regular  columns  commenting  on  economic,  political  and  social

ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualifies  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

Extensive  experience  with  aviation.  I  am  a  licensed  pilot  and  hold  land,  single-
and  multi-engine,  and  instrument  ratings,  as  well  as  a  glider’s  license.  I  have  been 
a  pilot  for  more  than  50  years  and  have  about  6,000  hours  of  total  time.  I  owned 
and operated my own aircraft for about 50 years. I was appointed by Governor Tom 
Ridge  as  Chairman  of  the  Pennsylvania  Aviation  Advisory  Committee,  and  I  pre-
viously  served  as  a  Governor  of  the  Lehigh-Northampton  Airport  Authority,  which 
operates  the  Lehigh  Valley  International  Airport.  I  have  had  extensive  experience 
as  a  board  member  of  private  and  public  organizations,  some  of  very  substantial 
size. 

Ronald  Reagan  Washington  National  and  Washington  Dulles  International  Air-
ports  are  facilities  of  the  greatest  importance  to  our  Capital  and  our  Nation.  I  be-
lieve I can continue to make a contribution to these Airports’ well being. 

18. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to ensure that the 
department/agency  has  proper  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience to you have in managing a large organization? 

My  responsibilities  as  a  Member  of  the  Board  of  the  Metropolitan  Washington 
Airports  Authority  is  to  work  with  my  fellow  board  members  to  clearly  enunciate 
policy, objectively monitor outcome data in terms of how successful we are in achiev-
ing  our  goals,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  chief  executive  officer 
and  his  staff,  and  to  be  vigilant  in  supervising  and  insisting  on  the  highest  level 
of honesty and integrity throughout the organization. 

MWAA  has  an  Audit  Committee,  on  which  I  serve,  which  meets  regularly  and  is 
very  active.  We  have  a  national  outside  auditor.  As  Chairman  of  the  Finance  Com-
mittee I have had intimate knowledge of and every opportunity to oversee MWAA’s 
integrity. 

19.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/

agency, and why? 

(1) Financial management that ensures the Authority’s ability to provide facilities 
needed  by  air  travelers  at  a  price  which  air  travelers  can  afford;  (2)  protecting 
Washington’s airports from adverse effects of the financial turmoil in the airline in-
dustry;  and  (3)  successful  undertaking  and  completion  of  the  rail  line  from  Wash-
ington to Dulles via Tysons Corner. 

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 
other  continuing  dealings  with  business  associates,  clients,  or  customers.  Please  in-
clude information related to retirement accounts: Not applicable. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? No. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated. 

All  my  investments,  obligations,  liabilities  and  other  relationships  have  been  re-
viewed at the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) and at the Airports Authority. We 
all  agree  that  none  presents  a  risk  of  conflict  of  interest.  A  copy  of  my  OGE  Form 
450 has been provided to the Committee. 

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have  had  during  the  last  10  years,  whether  for  yourself,  on  behalf  of  a  client,  or 
acting  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict 
of interest in the position to which you have been nominated: I cannot identify any. 
5.  Describe  any  activity  during  the  past  10  years  in  which  you  have  engaged  for 
the  purpose  of  directly  or  indirectly  influencing  the  passage,  defeat,  or  modification 
of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public pol-
icy. 

I  have  never  been  paid  as  an  advocate  of  public  policy  or  legislation,  nor  have  I 
ever  been  a  lobbyist.  However,  I  have  in  my  regular  newspaper  column  on  politics 
and economics made public pronouncements on all manner of policy issues. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

I  would  address  any  potential  conflict  of  interest  in  accordance  with  the  Airports 
Authority  ‘‘Code  of  Ethical  Responsibilities  for  Members  of  the  Board  of  Directors’’, 
which generally provides for full disclosure and recusal for apparent conflicts.

C. LEGAL MATTERS 

1.  Have  you  ever  been  disciplined  or  cited  for  a  breach  of  ethics  by,  or  been  the 
subject of a complaint to any court, administrative agency, professional association, 
disciplinary committee, or other professional group? No. 

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  any  Federal, 
state, or other law enforcement authority for violation of any Federal, state, county, 
or  municipal  law,  regulation,  or  ordinance,  other  than  for  a  minor  traffic  offense? 
If so, please explain. 

I  have  never  been  arrested,  charged  or  held  by  any  Federal,  state  or  other  law 
enforcement  authority  for  violation  of  any  Federal,  state,  county  or  municipal  law, 
regulation  or  ordinance  other  than  for  minor  traffic  offenses.  I  have  no  knowledge 
that I have ever been investigated. 

3.  Have  you  or  any  business  of  which  you  are  or  were  an  officer  ever  been  in-

volved as a party in an administrative agency proceeding or civil litigation? No. 

4.  Have  you  ever  been  convicted  (including  pleas  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere)  of 

any criminal violation other than a minor traffic offense? No. 

5.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or 

discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, or any other basis? No. 

6.  Please  advise  the  Committee  of  any  additional  information,  favorable  or  unfa-

vorable, which you feel should be disclosed in connection with your nomination. 

I have very substantial experience as a board member, board chairman and man-
ager.  I  have  fully  participated  in  the  board  deliberations  and  decisions  at  MWAA. 
I  have  a  near  perfect  attendance  record  of  board  and  committee  meetings.  I  have 
chaired the Finance Committee, a key MWAA committee. I now chair the Planning 
and  Construction  Committee  and  I  sit  on  other  committees  of  substantial  import, 
as, for example, the Compensation Committee. 

D. RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMITTEE 

1.  Will  you  ensure  that  your  board/commission  complies  with  deadlines  for  infor-

mation set by Congressional committees? 

To the extent it is within my power as one of thirteen Directors. 
2.  Will  you  ensure  that  your  board/commission  does  whatever  it  can  to  protect 
Congressional  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  from  reprisal  for  their  testimony  and 
disclosures? 

To  my  knowledge,  this  has  not  been  an  issue  at  the  Airports  Authority,  but  I 
would  want  to  make  sure  that  such  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  did  not  suffer 
reprisals. 

3.  Will  you  cooperate  in  providing  the  Committee  with  requested  witnesses,  in-
cluding technical experts and career employees, with firsthand knowledge of matters 
of interest to the Committee? Certainly. 

4.  Are  you  willing  to  appear  and  testify  before  any  duly  constituted  committee  of 

the Congress on such occasions as you may be reasonably requested to do so? 

I  have  always  been  willing  to  appear  and  testify  on  such  occasions,  and  will  re-

main so.

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Mr. Snelling. 
I presume that the lovely lady, back of you, is your wife? 
Mr. SNELLING. That is—of 56 years—Adriane Snelling. 
The CHAIRMAN. Sixty-six years? 
Mr. SNELLING. Fifty-six. 
The CHAIRMAN. Fifty-six? I’m 1 year ahead of you. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. SNELLING. Well, it gets better every year. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Snelling,  if  you  don’t  mind,  we’ll  have  a 
short  recess.  Senator  Specter  wishes  to  be  here  to  say  a  few 
words—kind  words  about  you,  but  he’s  caught  up  in  traffic  at  this 
moment. 

Mr.  SNELLING.  I  certainly  understand,  and  I  think  it’s  very  nice 

of the Senator to come. 

The CHAIRMAN. With that thought, we’ll have a short recess. 
Mr. SNELLING. Thank you, sir. 
[Recess.]

The CHAIRMAN. Will the hearing please come to order. 
The  Committee  is  most  pleased  to  welcome  the  gentleman  from 

Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. 

STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA 

Senator  SPECTER.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  It’s  al-
ways  a  great  pleasure  to  appear  before  you,  Mr.  Chairman—Sen-
ator  Inouye.  I’ve  enormously  enjoyed  our  long  association  and 
friendship together in the U.S. Senate. Of course, compared to you, 
I’m a newcomer. I’ve only been here 27 years, which doesn’t meas-
ure up too well to your 38—37, 39——

The CHAIRMAN. Forty-nine. 
Senator  SPECTER.  Forty-nine?  Just  one  digit  off,  Mr.  Chairman. 
I  have  the  honor  today,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  introduce  to  the  Com-
mittee  Mr.  Charles  Snelling  for  reappointment  to  the  Board  of  Di-
rectors  of  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Authority.  I’ve 
known Mr. Snelling for more than two decades, and can personally 
attest to his integrity, his ability, and his public service. 

Of  direct  relevance  to  serving  on  the  Metropolitan  Washington 
Airports  Authority  is  his  extensive  experience  in  the  field  of  avia-
tion. He is a licensed pilot. He has served on the board of directors 
for the Authority since 2003, when he was originally nominated by 
President Bush and confirmed by the Senate. He was appointed, in 
2000, by Pennsylvania’s Governor Tom Ridge, to be a member and 
chair  of  the  Pennsylvania  Advisory  Committee.  He  had  served  as 
the—on  the  board  of  directors  of  the  Lehigh-Northampton  Airport 
Authority, which operates the Lehigh Valley International Airport. 
He  has  a  very  extensive  record  in  the  business  community.  He 
is President and Director of the Snelling Company and Western Le-
high  Valley  Corporation,  a  trustee  of  the  Northeast  Pennsylvania 
Management  Trust,  and  a  director  of  the  Wiley  Technologies, 
former president of the City Council of Allentown, served as trustee 
on the Lehigh Valley Hospital Health Network, 5 years in that ca-
pacity. 

And I would ask unanimous consent to insert a formal statement 

into the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Specter follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  introduce  to  the  Committee  Mr.  Charles  D. 
Snelling as a nominee for reappointment to the Board of Directors of the Metropoli-
tan  Washington  Airports  Authority.  Mr.  Snelling  has  exemplary  aviation,  business 
and leadership qualifications that I believe make him a nominee worthy of confirma-
tion. 

Mr.  Snelling  is  a  licensed  pilot  with  extensive  experience  in  the  field  of  aviation. 
He has served aptly on the Board of Directors for the Metropolitan Washington Air-
ports  Authority  since  2003,  when  he  was  originally  nominated  by  President  Bush 
and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Additionally, Mr. Snelling was appointed in 2000 
by  Pennsylvania  Governor  Tom  Ridge  to  be  a  member  and  Chair  of  the  Pennsyl-
vania  Aviation  Advisory  Committee,  on  which  he  served  until  2003.  Prior  to  this 
service,  Mr.  Snelling  served  on  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Lehigh-Northampton 
Airport Authority, which operates the Lehigh Valley International Airport. 

Mr. Snelling’s business experience includes founding Cryo-Therm, Inc., an applied 
thermodynamics  company  that  pioneered  a  number  of  energy  conversion  systems 
and  processes  that  were  utilized  by  both  military  and  industry  and  resulted  in  Mr.

Snelling holding over 20 issued patents. Mr. Snelling has also achieved remarkable 
success  in  the  field  of  private  venture  capital,  real  estate  development  and  agri-
culture.  He  is  founder  and  director  of  a  family  of  venture  funds  that  is  widely  re-
garded as leading start-up venture investors. 

In addition to his aviation and business achievements. Mr. Snelling is also a lead-
ing  political  and  civic  figure.  In  1976,  he  was  appointed  by  President  Ford  to  the 
President’s Commission on Personnel Interchange and in 1990 he was appointed to 
serve  on  the  U.S.  Small  Business  Administration’s  National  Advisory  Committee. 
He  has  also  served  as  President  of  the  City  Council  of  Allentown  (PA),  Chairman 
of  the  Republican  Finance  Committee  of  Pennsylvania  and  delegate  to  the  Repub-
lican  National  Convention.  Presently,  he  serves  on  the  Pennsylvania  Republican 
State  Committee.  Mr.  Snelling’s  civic  experience  includes  service  as  a  Life  Trustee 
of  Cedar  Crest  College  in  Allentown,  PA;  a  trustee  of  the  Foundation  for  the  Ad-
vancement  of  Monetary  Education;  and  past  president  of  the  Pennsylvania  Society, 
to name a few. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  Nation’s  air  transportation  system  is  a  vital  asset  that  must 
be  properly  managed  to  ensure  its  safety  and  efficiency.  Our  nation’s  airports,  in-
cluding  those  managed  by  the  Metropolitan  Washington  Airports  Authority,  will 
face  enormous  challenges  meeting  projected  increases  in  congestion  and  passenger 
demand in the near future. Mr. Snelling has the experience and leadership qualities 
to  help  meet  these  challenges,  and  I  support  his  nomination  and  prompt  confirma-
tion by the U.S. Senate.

Senator  SPECTER.  He  appeared  before  this  Committee  last  year, 
and was reported out to the floor. And it is always hard to see what 
happens  there,  but  there  was  a  hold,  and  we  don’t  know  exactly 
why. This is something that I have communicated to the Chairman 
about before. And it’s my hope that we’ll be able to move his nomi-
nation  through  the  Committee,  and  move  it  through  the  floor,  so 
that  he  can  take  his  position  on  this  Authority,  where  I  think  he 
can perform very, very valuable public service. 

I thank the Chair for scheduling this hearing. I would have been 
here earlier, but we are struggling to get a quorum in the Judiciary 
Committee, where, as the Chairman knows, I am ranking member. 
We had judges to report out, so that that occupied me at 10 o’clock. 
But  I  came  over  as  soon  as  we  had  finished  the  judicial  business. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Committee  is  always  pleased  to  have  the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania here. Your words are always valued, 
and your recommendation will be carried out. 

If you’ll just wait a few seconds, the record will show that no one 
has  voiced  an  objection  to  the  nomination  of  Mr.  Snelling.  And  so, 
without  objection,  the  nomination  is  approved,  and  it  will  be  re-
ported to the Senate forthwith. 

Thank you very much. The hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 10:31 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
