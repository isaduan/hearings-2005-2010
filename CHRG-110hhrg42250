U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Water Supply Challenges

for the 21st Century

WEDNESDAY, MAY 14, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Wednesday, May 14, 2008, at 10:00 a.m. the House Committee on Science and
Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  entitled  ‘‘Water  Supply  Challenges  for  the  21st  Cen-
tury.’’  The  purpose  of  the  hearing  is  to  examine  the  challenges  of  managing  water
supplies  to  meet  social,  economic  and  environmental  needs  in  the  United  States.
Population  growth,  changes  in  water  use  patterns,  competing  demands  for  water
supply,  degradation  of  water  quality,  and  climatic  variation  are  all  factors  influ-
encing  the  availability  and  use  of  water.  The  hearing  will  also  examine  the  role  of
the  Federal  Government  in  helping  states  and  local  communities  adopt  and  imple-
ment sensible and cost-effective water resource management policies.

Background

Water is necessary to every aspect of life. Although some regions of the U.S. have
limited  water  supplies,  especially  areas  west  of  the  Mississippi  River,  the  U.S.  is
endowed  with  substantial  supplies  of  fresh  water.  However,  population  growth,  in-
creased per capita water use, water quality degradation, and increased withdrawals
to  support  agricultural,  industrial,  and  energy  production  activities  combined  with
climate variability have increased water shortages across the country.

In order to meet the challenge of providing safe, reliable water supplies for society
we  need  improved  information  about  the  status  of  our  water  resources,  policies  to
encourage  water  conservation,  and  technological  improvements  that  will  enable  us
to  maintain  and  improve  water  quality  and  to  improve  our  water-use  efficiency  to
allow  us  to  accomplish  society’s  goals  with  less  water.  Through  this  hearing,  the
Committee hopes to ascertain how and to what extent water science and technology
can ease the Nation’s water resource challenges.

Assessment of U.S. Water Supply

In  the  19th  century,  U.S.  population  stood  at  a  little  more  than  five  million  citi-
zens. By 1959, the U.S. population had grown to almost 180 million people. Our pop-
ulation is now over 300 million with a one percent rate of growth. Available surface
water supplies have not increased in the United States since the 1990s, and ground-
water tables are continuing to decline.1 It is clear that the U.S. water supply cannot
support future populations and economic activity at its current rate of consumption.
In  order  to  better  manage  water  supplies,  there  is  a  critical  need  for  good  data
about our water resources and how supplies vary over time. Currently, quantitative
knowledge of water supply is inadequate in the United States.2 The U.S. Water Re-
sources  Council  completed  the  most  recent,  comprehensive,  national  water  avail-
ability and use assessment in 1978.3

In  response  to  increased  concerns  about  future  increased  water  shortages,  the
Bush  Administration  created  the  Subcommittee  on  Water  Availability  and  Quality

(SWAQ)  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council’s  Committee  on  Environ-
ment and Natural Resources to coordinate a multi-year plan to improve research on
water  availability  and  quality.  The  Subcommittee  concluded  in  a  2007  report  that
a robust process for measuring water requires a systems approach to assess surface
water, ground water, rainfall, and snowpack from the perspectives of quantity, qual-
ity, timing, and location.4

Initiatives to Address Water Supply Shortages

States have initiated a number of steps to address water shortages. These activi-
ties  include:  Development  of  drought  preparedness  plans  to  reduce  their  vulner-
ability to droughts and development of drought response plans to provide assistance
to  communities  and  businesses  that  are  vulnerable  to  drought;  monitoring  water
availability  and  water  use  of  major  water  supplies;  coordinating  management  of
ground and surface water supplies; developing and implementing policies to encour-
age water conservation and allocate water among competing uses within their juris-
dictions;  exploring  options  for  increasing  water  supply  such  as  cloud  seeding  to  in-
crease rainfall or investment in desalinization plants.

At  the  federal  level,  there  are  numerous  federal  departments,  independent  agen-
cies,  and  several  bilateral  organizations  have  some  responsibility  for  water  pro-
grams and projects within the United States. The federal agencies with primary re-
sponsibilities  for  water  resources  include:  The  Bureau  of  Reclamation  which  pro-
vides  municipal  and  irrigation  water  and  operates  hydroelectric  facilities  in  the
western  states;  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  which  has  responsibility  for  projects
involving  flood  control  and  flood  plain  management,  water  supply,  navigation,  and
hydroelectric  power  generation;  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra-
tion  which  is  responsible  for  weather  and  climate  prediction  through  the  National
Weather  Service,  including  the  operation  of  the  National  Drought  Information  Sys-
tem  and  maintains  wildlife  habitat  and  ecosystem  protection  through  its  coastal
zone  and  fisheries  management  programs;  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  which  as-
sesses  the  quality,  quantity,  and  use  of  U.S.  water  resources  and  maintains  a  na-
tional  stream  gauge  network  used  for  monitoring  stream  and  river  flows  and  flood
forecasting;  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  which  protects  public  health  and
the  environment  by  ensuring  safe  drinking  water,  controlling  water  pollution,  and
protecting ground water.

The  Federal  Government  has  also  established  standards  for  toilets  and  the  Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency recently established a voluntary program, WaterSense,
to encourage the marketing and adoption of water conserving technologies and prac-
tices.

Most  of  the  authority  for  allocating  water  resides  within  State  governments.
When water disputes arise involving two or more states, the federal government has
a  role  to  play  based  upon  Congress’s  power  to  regulated  interstate  commerce  and
through  congressional  approvals  of  binding  agreements  known  as  compacts.  The
seven  Colorado  Basin  states  have  a  long-established  compact  governing  water  allo-
cation  of  the  Colorado  River.  The  extended  drought  in  the  Southeast  has  brought
attention  to  an  ongoing  interstate  conflict  among  Alabama,  Florida,  and  Georgia
over  water  allocation  in  the  Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint  (ACF)  river  system.
According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 47 states and the District
of  Columbia  at  some  time  have  been  involved  in  disputes  over  water  that  have  re-
sulted in litigation or initiated negotiations to establish an interstate compact.5

In  a  2003  report  of  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  report,  states
identified  five  federal  actions  they  believed  could  best  support  their  efforts  to  im-
prove water management. Better coordinated federal participation in water manage-
ment  agreements  along  with  financial  assistance  to  increase  storage  and  distribu-
tion  capacity,  improved  water  data,  flexibility  in  the  administration  of  environ-
mental  laws,  and  increased  consultation  on  federal  or  tribal  use  of  water  rights.6

Economic Impacts Associated with Water Shortages

In  the  United  States,  over  50,000  water  utilities  withdraw  approximately  40  bil-
lion gallons per day of water from the Nation’s resources, to supply water for domes-

tic consumption, industry, and other uses.7 When severe water shortages occur, the
economic  effect  can  be  substantial.  According  to  a  2000  report  from  the  National
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  eight  water  shortages  from  drought  or
heat  waves  each  resulted  in  $1  billion  or  more  in  monetary  losses  over  the  past  20
years.8

An adequate supply of treated water is integral to many industries, including ag-
riculture and food processing, beverages, power generation, paper production, manu-
facturing,  and  mineral  extraction.  Water  shortages  can  negatively  affect  companies
and entire industries and reduce job creation and retention. Current industry trajec-
tories, population growth, and dwindling water supplies all point to increased water
shortages. Increased water demand will come with increased costs to all businesses,
industries, and municipalities which rely on the same water resources. The Associa-
tion  of  California  Water  Agencies  (ACWA)  reported  in  April  2008  that  California  is
now losing income and jobs due to the state’s water supply crisis.9

Water Energy Nexus

Water  is  a  vital  component  of  our  economy’s  energy  sector.  Water  is  used  for  re-
source  extraction,  refining  and  processing  and  transportation.  Water  also  is  essen-
tial  for  electricity  generation.  The  expansion  of  biofuel  supply  is  also  going  to  re-
quire  substantial  water  resources.  The  National  Research  Council  predicts  that  the
surge in ethanol production is likely to lead to adverse effects on local water sources
and water quality.10

The  use  of  water  in  the  extraction  and  processing  of  petroleum-based  transpor-
tation fuels is relatively small compared to the electric-generating industry. Accord-
ing  to  the  Department  of  Energy’s  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory,  the
thermoelectric  power  sector  accounts  for  39  percent  of  total  freshwater  withdrawal
in  the  United  States,  and  3.3  percent  of  total  freshwater  consumption.  This  con-
sumption  for  electricity  production  accounts  for  over  20  percent  of  nonagricultural
water  consumption.  Water  is  also  used  directly  in  hydroelectric  generation,  which
constituted  approximately  14  percent  of  energy  produced  in  the  United  States  in
2006 according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Not  only  do  we  need  vast  quantities  of  water  for  energy  production,  but  we  also
need  energy  to  transport  and  treat  water.  DOE  estimates  that  nationwide,  about
four  percent  of  U.S.  power  generation  is  used  for  water  supply  and  treatment.
Across the country, the amount of energy used to provide water to meet agriculture
needs  represents  the  most  significant  regional  difference.  However,  the  supply  and
transport  of  water  can  be  quite  energy-intensive.  For  example,  pumping  water  to
consumers  that  live  far  away  from  the  source  can  be  energy  intensive.  California’s
State  Water  Project  pumps  water  444  miles  of  aqueducts  from  three  recreational
lakes  in  Plumas  County  in  Northern  California  to  Riverside  County  in  Southern
California  and  is  the  state’s  largest  energy  consumer  using  between  two  to  three
percent of California’s energy (5,000 GWh per year).11

Chairman GORDON. Good morning and welcome everyone, and to
our  witnesses,  thank  you  for  letting  us  conduct  a  little  business
here.

As  was  stated,  this  is  a  busy  time.  We  have  several  Members  in
markups elsewhere. They will be coming back, but their staff is ei-
ther  here  or  in  the  anteroom  watching.  This  will  be  televised,  so
we  will  have  the  opportunity  for  this  to  go  out,  and  we  appreciate
you being here.

Water  is  an  essential  input  to  virtually  everything  we  do,  from
growing and processing food to manufacturing the products we use
to  date,  to  producing  the  energy  we  need  to  power  our  economy.
Water is essential to all life and to maintain public health and the
diversity and beauty of our environment.

The  recent  droughts  experienced  in  the  West  and  the  Southeast
and increased competition for water supplies suggest that we must
take  a  closer  look  at  how  we  are  managing  our  water  resources.
Thirty-six states expect to experience significant water shortage by
2013,  population  growth,  increased  per-capita  water  use,  degraded
water  quality,  and  climate  change  have  all  impacted  our  avail-
ability, our available supplies of water.

In  my  district  water  sources  have  dried  up,  and  wells  have  run
dry.  Towns  have  been  forced  to  implement  water  restrictions  to
deal  with  a  decreased  supply.  According  to  the  Tennessee  Valley
Authority, the first eight months of 2007 were the driest in the last
118  years  of  Tennessee  history.  When  severe  water  shortage  oc-
curs,  the  economic  impact  is  substantial.  In  2007,  the  Tennessee
Valley  Authority  was  forced  to  shut  down  a  nuclear  reactor  due  to
a lack of acceptable cooling water in the Tennessee River.

According  to  a  2000  report  from  NOAA,  each  of  the  eight  water
shortages  over  the  past  20  years  from  drought  or  heat  wave  re-
sulted  in  $1  billion  or  more  in  monetary  losses.  A  recent  report  by
J.  P.  Morgan  indicated  that  a  single  production  interruption  at  a
semiconductor plant could cost $200 million in lost revenue.

I  believe  with  investment  in  research  and  development,  public
education,  and  better  information  on  the  status  of  our  water  sup-
plies,  we  could  avoid  the  high  cost,  social  disruption,  and  environ-
mental damage associated with water shortage.

Our committee has already begun to bring forward legislation to
help us better utilize water resources. Last week the Subcommittee
on  Energy  and  Environment  reported  bills  by  Representative  Hall
and Mr. Matheson to authorize research at the Department of En-
ergy and Environmental Protection Agency on water treatment and
to increase the efficiencies of our water use.

We  will  be  looking  for  more  opportunities  to  address  this  impor-

tant issue.

I would like to thank our panelists for appearing before us today
to  share  with  us  their  views  on  the  problems  we  currently  face  in
water  supply  and  their  suggestions  for  addressing  these  problems
in  the  future,  and  I  look  forward  to  a  lively  discussion  from  this

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Good morning and welcome to today’s hearing.

Water  is  the  essential  input  to  virtually  everything  we  do—from  growing  and
processing food to manufacturing the products we use everyday to producing the en-
ergy  we  need  to  power  our  economy.  Water  is  essential  to  all  life  and  to  maintain
public health and the diversity and beauty of our environment.

The  recent  droughts  experienced  in  the  West  and  the  Southeast  and  increased
competition  for  water  supplies  suggest  that  we  must  take  a  closer  look  at  how  we
are managing our water resources.

Thirty-six  states  expect  to  experience  significant  water  shortages  by  2013.  Popu-
lation  growth,  increased  per-capita  water  use,  degraded  water  quality,  and  climate
change have all impacted our available supplies of water.

In  my  district,  water  sources  have  dried  up  and  wells  have  run  dry,  and  towns

have been forced to implement water restrictions to deal with decreased supply.

According to the Tennessee Valley Authority, the first eight months of 2007 were

the driest in the last 118 years of Tennessee history.

When  severe  water  shortages  occur,  the  economic  impact  is  substantial.  In  2007,
the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority  was  forced  to  shut  down  a  nuclear  reactor  due  to
a lack of acceptable cooling water in the Tennessee River.

According  to  a  2000  report  from  NOAA,  each  of  the  eight  water  shortages  over
the past 20 years from drought or heat waves resulted in $1 billion or more in mon-
etary losses.

A  recent  report  by  JP  Morgan  indicated  that  a  single  production  interruption  at

a semiconductor plant could cost $200 million in lost revenue.

I believe with investment in research and development, public education and bet-
ter information on the status of our water supplies we can avoid the high costs, so-
cial disruption, and environmental damage associated with water shortages.

Our committee has already begun to bring forward legislation to help us to better

utilize water resources.

Last  week,  the  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment  reported  bills  by  Rep.
Hall and Rep. Matheson to authorize research at the Department of Energy and the
Environmental Protection Agency on water treatment and to increase the efficiency
of our water use.

We will be looking for more opportunities to address this important issue.
I  would  like  to  thank  our  panelists  for  appearing  before  us  today  to  share  with
us their views on the problems we currently face in water supply and their sugges-
tions  for  addressing  these  problems  in  the  future.  I  look  forward  to  a  lively  discus-
sion from this impressive panel.

Chairman  GORDON.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  yield  to  my  dis-
tinguished  colleague  from  Texas,  our  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Hall,
for an opening statement.

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  am,  of  course,

pleased that we are having this hearing here today.

Water supply is, as you say, a very critical issue facing our coun-
try.  Water  is  the  lifeblood  of  our  economy.  Every  sector  requires  it
and  would  be  crippled  without  it.  Energy  and  agriculture  are  the
two largest consumers of water, I understand, but it is also a vital
part of manufacturing, fishing, and obviously, everyday living.

Water’s  importance  to  U.S.  prosperity  is  one  that  has  been  dis-
cussed  in  various  reports  over  the  last  decade,  government  spon-
sored and private sector alike. It has hit home for some of us where
our districts have been subjected to periods of long drought or mas-
sive  flooding.  This  Congress  is  well  aware  of  the  dangers  of  water
shortages and over-abundance.

Two years ago we passed, and the President signed, the National
Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006. We did this in
response  to  a  need  for  a  centralized  location  for  drought  informa-
tion.  I  am  very  pleased  that  Dr.  Pulwarty  is  here  to  talk  about  it.
Although  this  law  is  not  the  only  answer,  it  is  part  of  the  larger
solution required for good water policy and good management.

What we need are the proper tools and resources for local, State,
and  regional  decision-makers  to  adapt  to  changing  conditions.  I

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased we are having this hearing today. Water
supply is a very critical issue facing our country. Water is the life-blood of our econ-
omy.  Every  sector  requires  it  and  would  be  crippled  without  it.  Energy  and  agri-
culture  are  the  two  largest  consumers  of  water,  but  it  is  also  a  vital  part  of  manu-

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall, and thank you for your
hospitality.  We  had  a  hearing  down  at  Texarkana  on  the  COM-
PETES  Bill  this  Monday,  and  it  was  very  interesting.  It  adds  to
our  committee’s  institutional  memory  and  knowledge  in  this  very
important area.

And  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  all  additional  opening  state-
ments  submitted  by  the  Committee  Members  be  included  in  the
record. Without objection, so ordered.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and

Environment, this issue is very important to me.

Dallas,  as  does  other  cities,  has  a  propensity  to  flood.  Adequate  infrastructure  is

important to properly manage water and avoid flooding problems.

On  the  other  hand,  the  State  of  Texas  has  encountered  years  of  tremendous
drought. Our cattle ranchers and farmers have depended on disaster relief from the
devastating lack of water.

The Science Committee has a role to play in water issues.
We can invest in research to examine infrastructure needs.
We  can  support  efforts  to  improve  water  clarity  and  purity,  to  protect  the  health

of our populace.

society.

We  can  direct  studies  on  climate  change  and  its  impact  on  our  water  resources.
We are tasked with the responsibility of ensuring a safe, reliable water supply for

We  need  improved  information  about  the  status  of  our  water  resources  and  poli-

cies to encourage water conservation,

We must discover technological improvements that will enable us to maintain and
improve water quality and to improve our water-use efficiency to allow us to accom-
plish society’s goals with less water.

Today’s  witness  panel  includes  individuals  representing  federal  advisory  groups
such  as  the  National  Research  Council  and  National  Oceanographic  and  Atmos-
pheric Association (NOAA).

It  also  includes  academic  witnesses,  such  as  Dr.  Overpeck  from  the  University  of

Arizona and the University of California–Santa Barbara.

The  Committee  will  be  interested  to  hear  the  panel’s  suggestions  as  to  water  re-

search and development priorities at the federal level.

Again, welcome to today’s witnesses. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member

for their leadership on this issue and yield back my time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  important  hearing  on  managing  the
U.S.  water  supply.  Population  growth,  variation  in  our  climate  and  degradation  of
water quality all complicate current water supply management in our nation.

It  is  incumbent  upon  those  of  us  in  Congress  to  examine  ways  that  we  can  im-
prove  water  conservation  efforts,  and  research  both  new  technologies  such  as  desa-
linization  to  increase  water  supply  as  well  as  avenues  to  improve  water  quality.  I
am particularly concerned about water quality in my own congressional district. One
county within my district is changing from a rural to more suburban county, which
has created pressure to supply more water to more people. Septic tanks are leaking
into  tributaries  and  streams  with  the  potential  for  contaminating  water  supply.  In
another area, sewer overflows occur due to an aging infrastructure.

I am also interested in the link between energy and water, which I anticipate Dr.
Wilkinson  will  address  in  his  testimony  today.  I  would  appreciate  hearing  more
about  his  views  on  hydroelectric  power  in  this  country,  whether  this  untapped  re-
source  is  worthy  of  additional  federal  investments  and  if  he  sees  room  for  further
research into more efficient power generation from hydroelectric dams.

I would like to thank today’s witnesses, Dr. Parker, Dr. Overpeck, Dr. Wilkinson,
Mr.  Levinson  and  Dr.  Pulwarty,  for  taking  the  time  to  appear  before  us.  I  look  for-
ward to hearing all of our witness’s testimonies.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The diminishing supply of water is an issue that truly hits home.
In Arizona, our habitability is closely tied to the availability of reliable safe water

sources.

According  to  the  Arizona  Department  of  Water  Resources,  Arizona  has  experi-
enced  drought  for  over  a  decade.  The  Colorado  River  system  as  a  whole  is  now  in
its eighth year of drought.

I believe that it is absolutely critical that we address the growing shortage of our
nation’s water supply and work to establish progressive and cost-effective water re-
source management policies.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  about  the  challenges  of  managing

water supplies.
I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ADRIAN SMITH

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Water supply issues are a challenge in my home State of Nebraska. Water avail-
ability  is  a  critical  concern  in  much  of  my  district  where  center  pivot  irrigation  is
the lifeblood of farmers. A nearly decade-long drought in Nebraska’s Panhandle has
put extreme stress on water resources and those who rely on them.

Water quality problems are potentially burdensome for small towns in my district,
which  face  high  costs  for  remediation  of  their  drinking  water  supplies  in  order  to
comply  with  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  regulations  pertaining  to  natu-
rally-occurring contaminants, such as arsenic, in their wells.

Energy  is  a  topic  on  everyone’s  mind  and  many  energy  generation  methods  re-
quire  water  to  produce  power.  Hydropower,  nuclear  energy,  petroleum  refining,
clean  coal  technologies,  and  biofuels  production  all  require  large  amounts  of  water.
I  have  long  been  an  advocate  of  keeping  all  energy  options  on  the  table.  I  want  to
ensure the water needed is available for the energy choices of the marketplace.

Balancing the various uses of water is a constant challenge as various groups de-
mand  its  use  for  drinking  water;  agriculture;  energy  generation;  habitat,  especially
for endangered species; and recreation. As a Nebraskan and a Congressman, I want
to  ensure  these  demands  are  properly  prioritized,  and,  as  possible,  they  each  are
recognized for their contribution to Nebraska’s economy and quality of life.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  testimony  of  our  witnesses  and  hope  they  will  be
able to shed light on each of these problems and offer practical steps for their reso-
lution.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to working with you in the future.
Chairman  GORDON.  It  is  my  pleasure  now  to  introduce  the  wit-

nesses this morning.

Dr.  Stephen  Parker  is  the  Director  of  the  Water  Science  and
Technology  Board  at  the  National  Research  Council,  and  Ms.  Gif-
fords,  I  would  like  to  yield  to  you.  Somehow  we  always  work  Ari-
zona into most hearings, so you are up.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It is a privilege for me to introduce a tremendous colleague from
Arizona, Dr. John Overpeck, who is one of the brightest stars of the
University of Arizona. Dr. Overpeck is a Climate Systems Scientist
at  the  UofA,  where  he  is  also  the  Director  for  the  Institute  for  the
Planet, for the Study of Planet Earth, Professor of Geosciences and
a Professor of Atmospheric Sciences.

Dr.  Overpeck  has  published  over  120  papers  on  climate  and  the
environmental sciences. He recently served as a Coordinating Lead
Author  for  the  Fourth  Assessment  Report  of  the  UN  Intergovern-
mental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  which  shared  the  2007  Nobel
Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore.

And  I  want  to  thank  you  and  your  colleagues  for  coming  to
present before our committee the reports from that very important
document.

For  his  interdisciplinary  research  Dr.  Overpeck  has  also  been
awarded  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  bronze  and  gold  med-
als, as well as the Walter Orr Roberts Award of the American Me-
teorological  Society.  He  has  been  a  Guggenheim  Fellow  and  serves
on the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science Magazine.

Dr.  Overpeck’s  research  focuses  on  global  change  dynamics  with
a  major  component  aimed  at  understanding  how  and  why  key  cli-
mate  systems  vary  on  time  scales  longer  than  seasons  and  years.
Through his research Dr. Overpeck is working to help foster a new
paradigm of interdisciplinary knowledge creation between physical,
biological, and social scientists, all with the goal of serving the en-
vironmental needs of society in a more effective manner.

I am very pleased to have Dr. Overpeck here. He is an authority
in  Arizona,  and  I  am  pleased  to  have  such  a  distinguished  panel,
group  of  panelists  to  talk  about  an  issue  that  is  vitally  important
to the West and to our country.

Dr. Parker, please begin.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  STEPHEN  D.  PARKER,  DIRECTOR,  WATER
SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY  BOARD,  NATIONAL  RESEARCH
COUNCIL
Dr. PARKER. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Com-
mittee,  and  others.  I  am  Stephen  Parker  from  the  National  Re-
search Council, and I am pleased to participate in today’s hearing.
I have been in my position at the Water Science and Technology
Board  for  26  years  and  have  overseen  about  200  studies  relevant
to today’s topic. Thus my remarks are general and drawn from our
body of work, not one particular recent study.

It is hard to overstate the importance of high-quality water sup-
plies to our nation, yet in many areas supplies are essentially fixed,
and  the  quality  is  deteriorating.  At  the  same  time,  demands  for
water  to  support  population  and  economic  growth,  the  environ-
ment,  and  other  purposes  continue  to  increase.  Examples  of  the
mounting  array  of  water-related  problems  exist  in  every  region  of
the country, especially the West and Southwest.

Both of these regions have rapidly-growing populations and have
been  affected  by  climate  variability,  drought,  and  the  tightening
water  supply  picture  as  many  new  users  vie  for  limited  supplies
and call for changes to traditional allocation rules.

Lasting  solutions  to  these  challenges  of  water  supply  and  de-
mand  and  water  quality  will  require  creative  science-based  strate-
gies and innovative water technologies.

I have phrased my central concerns in the form of four questions.
If  the  answers  to  some  of  these  questions  are  no,  I  fear  that  we
may be in for a national water crisis, something like that portrayed
in the media.

Question  one,  will  there  be  sufficient  water  to  support  both  fu-
ture economic and population growth while sustaining ecosystems?
The fast-growing Southwest and Southeast face great challenges in
meeting  increasing  water  demands.  Most  of  the  sources  and  sup-
plies  of  water  for  these  regions  are  fully  allocated  among  environ-
mental,  urban,  and  agricultural  uses.  Unfortunately,  the  Nation
seems  lacking  in  a  long-term  strategic  vision  of  alternative  means
for  accommodating  growth  with  existing  supplies.  We  believe  the
Nation  has  under-invested  in  research  and  development  needed  to
help municipalities augment water supplies in this post-dam-build-
ing era. For example, through waste water reuse, desalination, and
other approaches, including aquifer storage and recovery.

Question  two.  How  effectively  can  our  water  management  sys-
tems and institutions adapt to climate change? Existing data reveal
some  significant  climate  changes  in  the  U.S.  in  recent  years.
Warmer  temperatures  in  some  regions  and  potential  impacts  on
water  supplies  are  of  special  concern.  Although  there  are  uncer-
tainties  regarding  future  climate  projections,  there  is  broad  sci-
entific agreement that rising temperatures are having a number of
effects  such  as  earlier  melting  of  snowpack,  which  affects  agricul-

tural  production,  increases  flood  risks,  and  is  forcing  changes  in
reservoir operations. Two, higher sea levels, which will increase sa-
linity  in  coastal  water  supply  aquifers  and  alter  marshes  and  wet-
lands.  And  three,  in  changing  amounts  of  precipitation  and  ex-
treme climatic events.

My  question  three.  Will  drinking  water  be  safe?  Over  the  past
100  years  investments  in  water  treatment  and  distribution  infra-
structure  has  made  the  quality  of  U.S.  drinking  water  among  the
best in the world. Today we take safe water for granted. Neverthe-
less,  new  chemicals  and  biological  agents  continue  to  emerge  and
intentional  or  unintentional  contamination  of  drinking  water  sup-
plies represents a real and continuing threat. Additionally, much of
our  urban  drinking  water  infrastructure  is  reaching  the  end  of  its
expected  lifetime  and  will  need  to  be  replaced  in  the  next  25,  10
to 25 years.

Question  four.  Can  existing  water  policies  effectively  respond  to
present and future challenges? Many of the Nation’s water policies
and  practices  were  created  and  designed  for  yesterday’s  water  re-
sources  challenges  and  are  becoming  obsolete.  For  example,  the
National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Safe
Drinking  Water  Act,  and  the  Endangered  Species  Act  were  all
passed  in  the  early  1970s.  Likewise,  many  dam  operators  and
water  allocation  plans  are  designed  for  a  set  of  users  in  an  earlier
era  and  are  being  challenged  by  increasing  demands  from  users
such as recreational, urban, and environmental interests.

It seems important that the Nation’s water management institu-
tions  and  body  politics  stay  vigilant  to  assure  and  perhaps  restore
modern  and  appropriate  management  and  legal  instruments  to
meet the challenges. The case is compelling for governmental lead-
ership  and  support  for  water  resources  research  and  maintenance
of strong governmental scientific and technical capabilities.

My  written  statement  discusses  numerous  examples  of  past  fed-
erally-funded water research that have produced significant payoffs
to  the  Nation.  The  advances  in  water  science  and  technology  that
society is now requiring are likely to be inadequate if federal action
is  not  taken  as  the  states  and  non-governmental  organizations
have limited resources to invest in required research.

That concludes my statement. I commend the Committee for rec-
ognizing  the  importance  of  water  resource  and  the  role  of  the  gov-
ernment  in  water  resources  to  the  Nation.  I  hope  you  act  quickly
and  strategically,  as  I  often  worry  that  we  are  living  on  borrowed
water  capacity,  created  by  conservative  engineers  in  the  past,  and
that our water supply cushion is disappearing.

I would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN D. PARKER

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  and  others.  My  name
is  Stephen  D.  Parker.  I  am  Director  of  the  Water  Science  and  Technology  Board
(WSTB) of the National Research Council. As you may know, the National Research

environmental needs of the United States. Population growth, changes in water use
patterns,  competing  demands  for  water  supply,  degradation  of  water  quality,  and
climatic  variations  all  are  factors  that  influence  the  availability  and  use  of  water.
I  have  held  my  position  with  the  WSTB  for  26  years  and  have  overseen  approxi-
mately  200  studies  relevant  to  the  topic  of  today’s  hearing.  Thus,  my  remarks  are
drawn  from  a  whole  body  of  work,  rather  than  just  one  recent  report.  (Note  that
my written statement has attached to it a listing of some our most relevant reports
from the past several years.) Given the nature of the WSTB mission—to help ensure
and improve the scientific basis for water management—my statement tends to em-
phasize science and research.

High  quality,  reliable  drinking  water  is  fundamental  to  human  existence  and
quality of life. Not only is water a basic human need, but adequate, safe water sup-
plies  are  crucial  to  the  Nation’s  health,  economy,  security,  and  ecosystems.  A  key
strategic  challenge  is  to  ensure  adequate  quantity  and  quality  of  water  to  meet
human and ecological needs, especially given the growing competition among domes-
tic, industrial-commercial, agricultural, and environmental uses. To successfully ad-
dress  the  Nation’s  water  resources  problems  likely  to  emerge  in  the  next  10–15
years,  decision-makers  at  all  levels  of  government  will  need  to  make  informed
choices among often conflicting and uncertain alternative actions.

There  is  abundant  evidence  that  the  conditions  of  water  resources  in  many  parts
of the United States are deteriorating. Further, demands for water resources to sup-
port  population  and  economic  growth  continue  to  increase,  although  water  supplies
generally are fixed in quantity and already are fully allocated in most areas. Exam-
ples  of  the  mounting  array  of  water-related  problems  exist  in  every  region  of  the
country.  Today,  these  problems  are  especially  pronounced  in  the  West  and  in  the
Southeast. Both these areas are sites of rapidly-growing populations and have been
affected  by  climate  variability,  drought,  and  a  tightening  water  supply  picture  as
multiple and new users vie for changes to more traditional allocation rules and pat-
terns.  Lasting  solutions  to  these  challenges  of  water  supply  and  demand  balances,
as  well  as  water  quality,  will  require  creative,  science-based,  and  economically  fea-
sible  strategies.  The  following  questions  highlight  the  central  concerns;  if  answers
to  some  of  these  questions  are  ‘‘no,’’  it  portends  a  future  with  complex  water  re-
source problems that will challenge the capacities of our scientific, engineering, and
management  organizations  charged  to  address  water  resources  issues.  (Note  that  I
do not attempt to separate water quantity from water quality considerations as the
two are inextricably linked.)

• Will there be sufficient water to both sustain ecosystems and support
future economic and population growth? The fast-growing states and cit-
ies  of  the  Southwest  face  great  challenges  in  meeting  increasing  water  de-
mands. Most of the sources and supplies of water for this arid region are fully
allocated among environmental, urban, and agricultural uses. Mechanisms for
reallocating water away from current uses, along with technological means for
augmenting  supplies,  all  have  physical,  economic,  and  social  limits.  Other
rapidly  growing  areas  of  the  Nation,  like  the  Southeastern  U.S.,  also  are  ex-
hibiting increasing vulnerability to drought. The traditional means for coping
with ever-increasing water demands was to augment supplies by constructing
more  dams.  For  a  number  of  reasons,  that  strategy  today  is  far  less  viable.
Unfortunately, the Nation has limited precedent and seemingly a lack of long-
term,  strategic  vision  for  alternative  means  for  coping  with  increasing  eco-
nomic  and  population  growth  with  existing,  limited  water  supplies.  Further-
more,  we  believe  the  Nation  has  under-invested  in  the  research  needed  to
help municipalities augment water supplies, for example through wastewater
reuse, desalination, or aquifer storage and recovery.

• How  effectively  can  our  water  management  systems  and  institutions
adapt  to  climate  change?  Existing  data  reveal  some  significant  climate
changes  in  the  U.S.  in  recent  years,  with  implications  for  water  quality  and
quantity.  Warmer  temperatures  in  some  regions,  and  potential  impacts  on
water  supplies,  are  a  special  concern.  Although  there  are  uncertainties  re-
garding  future  climate  projections,  there  is  broad  scientific  agreement  that
rising  temperatures  are  having  a  number  of  effects,  such  as  (1)  earlier  melt-
ing  of  snowpack,  which  affects  agricultural  production,  increases  flood  risks,
and is forcing changes in reservoir operations; (2) higher sea levels, which will
increase  salinity  in  coastal  aquifers  and  alter  marshes  and  wetlands;  and  (3)
changing patterns of precipitation, such that extreme climatic events may in-
crease in magnitude and frequency.

• Will drinking water be safe? Over the past 100 years, investment in water
treatment and distribution infrastructure has made the quality of U.S. drink-
ing water among the best in the world. Enormous gains in public health were
realized from the virtual elimination of typhoid and cholera, such that today,
the provision of safe supplies of drinking water is taken for granted. Nonethe-
less,  new  chemical  and  biological  agents  continue  to  emerge  and  intentional
or  unintentional  contamination  of  drinking  water  supplies  represents  a  real
and  continuing  threat.  Further,  much  of  our  drinking  water  infrastructure  is
reaching the end of its usable lifetime and will need to be replaced in the next
10–25 years.

• Will  the  quality  of  the  Nation’s  waters  be  enhanced  and  maintained?
Passage of the Clean Water Act helped the Nation make great progress during
the  1970s  and  1980s  in  improving  surface  water  quality,  through  financial
support  for  municipal  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  a  permitting  process
for  point  sources  of  water  pollution.  Today,  the  more  pressing  surface  water
quality  problem  is  non-point  source  pollution.  Effective  management  of  non-
point  source  pollution  problems  requires  good  data  on  surface  water  quality.
However,  there  are  only  limited  water  quality  data  for  many  of  the  Nation’s
rivers and streams, including some large and very important ones. For exam-
ple,  a  2008  report  of  ours  noted  the  limited  data  and  limited  monitoring  ef-
forts in many stretches of the Mississippi River, and recommended a more ex-
tensive  and  integrated  approach  to  the  river’s  water  quality  monitoring  and
assessment.  Better  information  on  water  quality,  and  better  management  of
non-point  source  pollution  problems,  also  will  require  stronger,  more  aggres-
sive federal leadership.

• Can existing water policies effectively respond to present and future
challenges?  Many  of  the  Nation’s  water  policies  and  practices  were  created
and  designed  for  an  earlier  era  of  water  resources  challenges  and  problems.
For example, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Safe  Drinking  Water  Act,  and  the  Endangered  Species  Act  all  were  passed  in
the  early  1970s.  Further,  many  dam  operations  and  water  allocation  plans,
designed for a set of users in an earlier era, are being challenged by increas-
ing demands from users such as recreational, urban, and environmental inter-
ests. Moreover, many water professionals are concerned about declining engi-
neering  and  scientific  capacity  in  the  Nation’s  key  water  resources  organiza-
tions—which is occurring at a time when the Nation needs high-level, profes-
sional expertise in its primary water institutions more than ever.

Advances in the science and technology through research needed to address these
problems  are  likely  to  be  inadequate  if  no  federal  actions  are  taken,  as  the  states
and non-governmental organizations have limited resources to invest in required re-
search. The Nation also will need stronger expertise in its leading water institutions
in  order  to  stay  abreast  of  engineering  and  scientific  developments,  and  to  be  able
to interact productively with the scientific community at large. The increasing need
to  ensure  clean  and  adequate  water  supplies,  and  to  manage  increasingly  rapid
human-induced modification of natural and social environments, make a compelling
case for governmental support of water resources research and strong governmental
scientific and technical capacity.

There are numerous examples of federal government-funded research on water re-
sources that have led to significant payoffs for the Nation. The flood forecasting sys-
tems that help save lives and protect property, and the drought forecasting systems
that  help  keep  farmers  and  municipalities  abreast  of  water  availability  conditions,
both  rest  on  federally  supported  data  gathering  and  research.  Research  in  the  past
has  led  to  the  development  of  innovative  water  and  wastewater  treatment  tech-
nologies,  such  as  membranes.  Other  examples  include  improved  management  of
salts  in  irrigated  agriculture,  and  better  understanding  of  implications  regarding
voluntary  transfers  of  water  among  different  users.  Studies  of  eutrophication  in  in-
land  waters,  mercury  deposition,  and  nitrogen  loading  in  the  Chesapeake  Bay  wa-
tershed  seem  to  provide  examples  of  federally  funded  research  that  has  improved
the  effectiveness  of  regulatory  processes.  Research  has  allowed  the  Nation  to  in-
crease  the  productivity  of  its  water  resources,  such  that  today  the  same  amount  of
water  yields,  on  average,  more  agricultural  output  than  it  did  50  or  100  years  ago.
Finally,  the  Nation  today  uses  many  aspects  of  its  water  resources  base  far  more
efficiently  than  in  the  past,  due  to  advances  in  water-efficient  plumbing  fixtures,
landscaping practices, and wastewater reuse techniques. Future scientific and tech-
nical  advances  will  be  required  to  meet  the  water  resources  needs  of  an  expanding

U.S.  population  and  to  maintain  the  quality  of  the  Nation’s  surface,  groundwater,
and aquatic systems.

That  concludes  my  statement.  I  commend  the  Committee  for  recognizing  the  im-
portance  of  water  resources—and  the  role  of  the  Federal  Government  in  water  re-
sources—to the Nation. I’d be happy to answer your questions. Thank you!

STATEMENT OF DR. JONATHAN OVERPECK, DIRECTOR, INSTI-
TUTE  FOR  THE  STUDY  OF  PLANET  EARTH;  PROFESSOR,
GEOSCIENCES  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  SCIENCES,  UNIVERSITY
OF ARIZONA
Dr.  OVERPECK.  Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Member  Hall,  Con-
gresswoman  Giffords,  and  other  distinguished  Members  of  the
Committee, I thank you for allowing me to come and discuss these
issues with you today.

One  of  our  chief  potential  challenges  to  ensuring  reliable  water
supply  will  be  climate  variability  and  also  climate  change.  And  it
appears likely that both climate variability and climate change are
already  starting  to  challenge  water  supply  in  parts  of  our  country.
in  drought.
Droughts in the West, central plains, Texas, and the Southeast all
vie  for  title  of  the  worst  current  drought.  These  droughts  now  oc-
curring  in  the  U.S.  are,  however,  modest  compared  to  the  severe
natural droughts that took place before the 20th century.

Significant  parts  of  our  nation  are  currently 

For example, western North America has seen 25-year and much
longer  megadroughts  in  just  the  last  1,000  years.  It  is  safe  to  say
that  if  the  water  supply  infrastructure  in  many  parts  of  our  coun-
try, for example, the West, were to see such a drought, it would be
overwhelmed today.
However,  what 

these  natural
megadroughts  of  the  past  is  that  we  are  not  sure  what  caused
them,  nor  are  we  confident  that  we  can  predict  them.  It  is  just  a
matter  of  time  before  we  will  get  another  megadrought,  and  this
means  that  we  should  think  seriously  about  making  our  society
more resilient in the face of megadroughts.

is  most  disturbing  about 

Now, I would like to turn to the issue of climate change. The cli-
mate  system  is  changing,  very  likely  due  to  humans,  and  this
change could also pose another major challenge to water supply in
parts  of  our  nation.  Parts  of  our  country  have  already  warmed
more  than  two  degrees  Fahrenheit  in  the  last  century  and  could
warm  another  15  or  more  degrees  by  the  end  of  the  century  if  we
don’t do something to curb emissions of greenhouse gases.

The  warming  has  already  led  to  substantial  decreases  in  spring
snowpack, which, in turn, has led to decreased flow in some major
river  systems  of  the  United  States,  including  the  Colorado  River.
Current  river  flow  estimates  for  some  parts  of  the  country,  for  ex-
ample,  the  Colorado  River,  that  serves  seven  states  and  over  30
million people, indicates that water supply could be greatly reduced
by mid century or before.

In  addition,  the  latest  climate  change  science  indicates  that
much of the conterminous U.S. could see an increase in the annual
maximum number of consecutive dry days between rainfall events,
a  decrease  in  average  soil  moisture,  and  an  increased  likelihood  of
drought.  Although  the  projected  changes  are  less  certain  outside
the  West  and  Southwest,  the  current  state  of  climate  science  sug-
gests that they, these all should be considered real possibilities for
the future.

What  then  can  we  do  about  this  challenge?  Fortunately,  there
are  some  no-regrets  actions  that  can  be  taken  regardless  of  cause,
natural  or  human-caused  climate  change.  We  need  an  accelerated
effort to understand climate-related water supply variabilities, both
physical, biological, and social.

For example, we must incorporate realistic assessments of future
climate change into water management models that are being used
to  assess  future  supply  change.  Also,  ground  water  serves  as  a
major  buffer  during  times  of  drought.  We  must  try  and  determine
how  much  ground  water  really  exists  underground  at  local  scales
around  our  country  and  how  quickly  this  ground  water  can  be  re-
charged  in  the  future,  both  by  precipitation  and  human  mecha-
nisms.

And  lastly,  we  need  to  determine,  for  example,  how  much  water
can  be  diverted  safely  from  agriculture,  another  important  buffer
in  times  of  drought,  to  uses  that  support  population  growth  in  po-
tentially water-limited regions.

Number two, we need an accelerated effort to understand climate
change  variability,  climate  variability  and  climate  change  proc-
esses, as well as how to predict them. Essential progress can be ac-
celerated  via  greater  funding  of  basic,  for  example,  National
Science  Foundation  and  use-inspired,  for  example,  NOAA,  DOE,
and NASA, climate research observation and modeling.

Number  three,  we  need  a  national  climate  service  that  is  de-
signed  to  support  local  and  regional  decision-makers  in  dealing
with climate-related reductions in water supply.

Finally, in addition to no-regrets options that I have just summa-
rized,  there  is  also  the  option  of  mitigating  or  reducing  the  likely
impacts of climate change on U.S. water supply. If we wish to fore-
stall  for  sure  potential  major  climate  change  threats  to  water  sup-
ply,  large  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  namely  80  per-
cent below 1990 levels by 2050, must be initiated soon.

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN OVERPECK

Summary

One  of  the  chief  potential  challenges  to  ensuring  a  reliable  water  supply  will  be
climate  variability  and  climate  change.  An  analysis  of  recent  climate  patterns  indi-
cates  that  both  are  already  starting  to  challenge  water  supplies  in  our  nation,  and
that  these  on-going  challenges  provide  an  important  lesson  for  the  future.  Climate
variability, in the form of decades-long drought, is a major threat to ensuring suffi-
cient  water  supplies.  Human-caused  climate  change,  including  temperature  in-
creases,  snowpack  reductions,  streamflow  decreases,  and  increased  probability  of
drought,  will  only  make  the  situation  more  challenging.  Options  for  meeting  these
climate  challenges  include  much  needed  focused  research,  a  new  national  climate
service  focused  on  local  and  regional  decision-makers,  and  a  policy  that  reduces
global  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  outlook  for  climate-related  changes  in  U.S.
water  supply  is  not  positive,  particularly  in  the  West,  Southwest,  Texas  and  into
the  Southeast.  Even  in  other  parts  of  the  Nation,  water  supply  could  become  more
limiting.  However,  the  good  news  is  that  there  is  time  to  prepare  for  increasing
water  supply  challenge,  and  to  also  avoid  water  supply  reduction  threats  deemed
dangerous. Urgent attention is warranted.

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  other  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  on  Water  Supply
Challenges for the 21st Century.

My  name  is  Jonathan  Overpeck.  I  am  the  Director  of  the  Institute  for  the  Study
of  Planet  Earth  at  the  University  of  Arizona,  where  I  am  also  a  Professor  of  Geo-
sciences  and  a  Professor  of  Atmospheric  Sciences.  I  have  published  more  than  120
papers  in  climate  and  the  environmental  sciences,  and  recently  served  as  a  Coordi-
nating Lead Author for the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Fourth Assessment (2007). I have been awarded the U.S. Department of Commerce
Bronze  and  Gold  Medals,  the  Walter  Orr  Roberts  award  of  the  American  Meteoro-
logical  Society  and  a  Guggenheim  Fellowship  for  my  interdisciplinary  research.  I
also  serve  as  Principal  Investigator  of  the  Climate  Assessment  for  the  Southwest
(CLIMAS), an interdisciplinary Regional Integrated Science and Assessment (RISA)
project  funded  by  NOAA.  In  this  capacity,  and  others,  I  work  not  only  on  climate
system  research,  but  also  on  supporting  use  of  this  research  by  decision-makers  in
society.

One  of  the  chief  potential  challenges  to  ensuring  a  reliable  water  supply  will  be
climate  variability  and  climate  change.  I  would  like  to  describe  these  challenges,
and  then  discuss  what  our  nation  can  do  to  meet  them.  A  basic  message  is  that  it
appears likely that both climate variability and climate change are already starting
to  challenge  water  supplies  in  our  nation,  and  that  these  on-going  challenges  are
an important lesson for the future.

Climate Variability, Drought and Water Supply

As  Figure  1  shows,  drought  is  currently  affecting  significant  portions  of  our  na-
tion.  Droughts  in  the  West,  Central  Plains,  Texas,  and  in  the  Southeast  vie  for  the
title  of  worst  current  drought.  Most  notably,  the  drought  in  the  West,  although  re-
cently  softened  by  good  winter  snowfall,  has  persisted  since  about  1999,  and  could
be far from over.

The  causes  of  the  current  droughts  across  the  U.S.  are  hotly  debated  in  the  cli-
mate  science  community,  but  it  is  safe  to  say  that  at  least  some  of  the  current
drought conditions are due to natural climate variability. Most likely, variability in
the  oceans  is  causing  atmospheric  circulation  to  drive  drier-than-normal  conditions
in  parts  of  our  nation.  For  example,  this  seems  to  be  the  prime  candidate  for  ex-
plaining the Southeast U.S. drought.

Drought  of  the  type  now  occurring  in  the  U.S.  is  modest  compared  to  the  more
severe  natural  droughts  that  took  place  before  the  twentieth  century.  These  earlier
droughts can be reconstructed using tree-rings, lake sediments, cave formations, and
other  natural  archives  of  past  climate.  For  example,  western  North  America,  from
deep  into  Mexico,  through  the  western  U.S.  and  into  Canada,  was  gripped  by  a  se-
vere  20-  to  25-year  drought  in  the  late  sixteenth  century.  Droughts  lasting  many
decades  occurred  during  medieval  times  in  the  West,  and  likely  had  profound  im-
pacts.  For  example,  we  now  know  from  hydrological  modeling  that  these  past
‘‘megadroughts,’’ were they to occur in the future, would have dramatic negative im-
pacts on the Colorado River and the water this river supplies to seven states.

It is safe to say that the water supply infrastructure in many parts of our country
(e.g.,  the  West)  would  be  overwhelmed  were  a  megadrought  like  those  of  the  past  to
occur again in the future. I will return to this challenge later in my testimony.

What  is  most  disturbing  about  the  natural  droughts  of  the  past  is  that  we  are
not  sure  what  caused  them,  nor  are  we  confident  that  we  can  predict  them.  Thus,
it  is  difficult  for  climate  scientists  to  say  how  long  the  current  droughts  will  last,
or  whether  they  will  intensify.  What  climate  scientists  can  say,  however,  is  that  it
would  be  foolish  to  assume  that  droughts  much  longer—and  more  severe—than
those of the last 100 years won’t happen again. It is just a matter of time, and this
means  that  we  should  think  seriously  about  making  our  society,  particularly  in
those areas that are prone to drought (e.g., see Figure 1), more resilient in the face
of future drought.

Climate Change and Water Supply

The climate system is changing, very likely due to humans, and this change could
also  pose  another  major  challenge  to  water  supply  in  parts  of  our  nation.  Although
temperatures  over  most  of  our  country  have  risen  over  the  last  100  years,  climate
change is most notable in the U.S. West and Alaska. Across the West, temperatures
have gone up by about 2°F, and more than the national average. This warming has
led to significant decreases in spring snowpack, which in turn, have led to decreased
flow  in  some  major  rivers,  including  the  Colorado  River.  These  temperature,  snow,
and  river  flow  changes  appear  to  be  due,  at  least  in  part,  to  human-caused  climate
change.  These  changes  are  also  quite  similar  to  those  projected  by  climate  models
for the future.

Furthermore,  there  are  some  indications—still  hotly  debated  in  the  climate
science  community—that  the  current  western  drought  itself  may  be  related  to
human  causes.  In  the  Southwest,  we  have  seen  a  northward  shift  in  winter/spring
storm  systems  that  seems  consistent  with  our  understanding  of  human-caused  cli-
mate  change,  and  leaves  the  region  with  below-average  precipitation.  However,  it
is  too  early  to  know  for  sure  if  the  current  western  drought,  the  worst  in  at  least
100 years, is due to humans or not. What we do know is that human-caused warm-
ing  is  making  the  impacts  of  the  drought  more  serious  than  the  cooler  droughts  of
the twentieth century.

Many of the climate changes we are currently seeing appear to be consistent with
what  climate  models  project  for  the  future.  Given  the  recent  (since  2000)  jump  in
global  carbon  dioxide  emissions  to  the  atmosphere,  we  are  now  on  track,  over  the
next  100  years,  to  warm  parts  of  the  coterminous  U.S.  by  more  than  15°F  in  sum-
mer.  This  change,  when  coupled  with  dramatic  warming  in  other  seasons  as  well,
should  drive  a  much  greater  atmospheric  demand  for  moisture,  reduced  spring
snowpack, and regional river flows in the western U.S.

Figure 2 shows only one recent estimate of how runoff, and hence river flow, could
change  in  the  next  50  years.  Other  estimates  exist,  but  for  the  Colorado  River
Basin,  almost  all  estimates  are  negative;  some  estimate  suggest  as  much  as  a  40
percent  reduction  could  occur  by  mid-century.  Future  warming  and  precipitation
change,  particularly  in  the  spring  season,  appears  to  point  only  to  one  direction  of
water supply change - down.

Might  Climate  Change  Spare  Water  Supply  in  all  but  the  West  and  South-

west?

Figure 2, as well as most other projections of future climate-related water supply,
paints a challenging picture for the West and Southwest regions of the country that
have recently been experiencing some of the fastest growing populations in the Na-
tion.  Does  this  mean  the  rest  of  the  country  is  safe  from  climate-related  reductions
in water supply? The answer is almost certainly ‘‘No.’’

In addition to the average change depicted in Figure 2, climate theory and projec-
tions also point to a human-caused increase in the frequency of drought. The recent
IPCC  (2007)  assessment  of  climate  model  projections  indicates  much  of  the
conterminous  U.S.  should  see  an  increase  in  the  annual  maximum  number  of  con-
secutive  dry  days  between  rainfall  events,  a  decrease  in  average  soil  moisture,  and
an increased likelihood of drought. Although these projected changes are less certain
outside  the  West  and  Southwest,  the  current  state  of  climate  science  suggests  they
should be considered real possibilities for the future.

The Combined Challenge of Climate Variability and Climate Change.

Current  scientific  understanding  of  both  climate  variability  (drought)  and  climate
change  indicates  that  there  is  a  real  future  likelihood  of  both  natural  and  human-
caused  reductions  in  climate-related  water  supply.  We  now  know  that  decades-long
droughts can occur naturally in parts of the U.S., just as climate change could lead
to greater aridity and an enhanced probability of drought in many parts of the coun-
try, particularly the West, Southwest, Texas, and across to the Southeast. These are
the same parts of the country that are now experiencing drought. Thus, the present
could be a window on the future.

Meeting the Climate Challenge to U.S. Water Supply.

The  future  climate  challenge  confronting  our  nation’s  water  supply  is  real,  and
will likely be due to both natural and human-caused threats. Fortunately, there are
some ‘‘no-regrets’’ actions that can be taken regardless of cause:
(1)  Call  for,  and  support,  an  accelerated  effort  to  understand  climate-re-
lated  water  supply  vulnerabilities,  both  physical,  biological,  and  social.
Much  remains  to  be  learned  about  our  nation’s  water  supply,  and  how  it  might  be
managed in the future. It is outside the scope of this testimony to go into great de-
tail, but some key questions warrant greater understanding:

• How  can  we  improve  the  current  generation  of  hydrologic  models  used  to
project  future  river  flow?  For  example,  model-based  estimates  of  future  cli-
mate-change related reductions in Colorado River flow range from small (e.g.,
10  percent)  to  large  (e.g.,  40  percent)  by  the  middle  of  the  century.  Effective
management of future water supply will require better hydrologic models.
• How best incorporate realistic assessments of future climate change into river
management  models?  This  process  has  begun,  but  needs  to  be  accelerated
given the importance of realistic projections not just of physical water supply,
but also how well these supplies can be managed to meet projected use.
• How  much  groundwater  exists  locally  around  the  country,  and  how  quickly
can  groundwater  be  recharged  in  the  future,  both  by  precipitation,  and/or
human mechanisms? Many parts of the country, particularly in the West, con-
sider  groundwater  to  be  a  principal  source  of  water,  at  least  in  times  of  sur-
face-flow shortage. And yet, precise information about the volume of these un-
derground  water  resources  is  often  not  available,  nor  is  the  full  potential  of
underground  water  banking  fully  understood.  This  limits  realistic  planning.
• How  much  water  can  be  diverted  safely  from  agricultural  use  to  uses  that
support  population  growth  in  potentially  water  limited  regions?  In  many
areas,  agriculture  accounts  for  70  percent  or  more  of  total  water  usage.  How
much  of  this  water  should  be  diverted  from  agricultural  use  in  order  to  sup-
port  population  growth,  or  is  water  left  in  agriculture  best  viewed  as  a  re-
source  that  can  buffer  long  droughts  when  other  water  resources  become  in-
adequate.  Water  left  in  agriculture  can  be  sold  to  non-agricultural  users  in
order to make up for water lost to drought. What is the true value of agricul-
tural water use?

(2) Call for, and support, an accelerated effort to understand climate varia-
bility and climate change processes, as well as how to predict them. Climate
change science has made tremendous advances in the last decade, but is still limited
due  to  incomplete  science  infrastructure  and  knowledge.  Essential  progress  can  be
accelerated  via  greater  funding  of  basic  (e.g.,  NSF)  and  ‘‘use-inspired’’  (e.g.,  NOAA,
DOE  and  NASA)  climate  change  research.  Well-planned  global  climate  observing
systems—both  in  situ  and  space-based—must  be  completed,  and  special  efforts  are
needed  to  extend  these  observing  networks  to  include  much  denser  climate-related
observations  at  the  local  to  regional  scales  so  important  for  decision-making.  Cli-
mate  modeling  capability  must  also  be  enhanced  to  improve  the  realism  of  state-
of-the-art  models,  particularly  with  regard  to  simulating  (and  predicting)  climate
variability and change at the global to regional-scales needed for enhanced planning
and decision-making.

Some  regions  with  likely  greater-than-average  exposure  to  climate-related  water
challenges, require an extra effort to understand what is at stake and what we can
do about it. For example, the Southwest U.S. is the fastest growing part of the coun-
try,  but  it  is  also  the  region  that  could  be  most  at  risk  to  water  supply  shortage.
Despite  this,  we  lack  an  adequate  understanding  of  the  summer  monsoon  system
that  brings  substantial  rainfall  to  some  parts  of  the  region.  We  can’t  say  whether
this  summer  rainfall  will  likely  go  up,  or  go  down.  We  don’t  know  the  implications
of  how  changes  in  this  basic  water  resource  could  be  managed.  As  with  other  key
regional  issues,  urgent  attention  is  needed  to  make  sure  that  some  parts  of  the
country don’t become big losers in the face of climate variability and change.
(3) Call for, and support, a national climate service that is designed to sup-
port local and regional decision-makers in dealing with climate-related re-
ductions  in  water  supply.  At  present,  the  climate-related  decision-support  needs
of  regional  stakeholders  (e.g.,  water  managers)  are  not  met  adequately.  A  number
of federal and State agencies have recognized this problem, and planning has begun
at  a  number  of  levels  for  a  more  organized,  interagency,  national  climate  service.
The key to success for such a service is that it be accountable to, and meet the needs
of,  regional  decision-makers.  This  service  should  benefit  from  the  national  climate
research,  observations  and  modeling  infrastructure  (e.g.,  within  NOAA),  and  it
should  also  benefit  from  the  experiences,  and  stakeholder-partnerships,  of  the
NOAA-funded interdisciplinary Regional Integrated Science and Assessment (RISA)
program. Any national climate service needs to have a strong accountability mecha-
nism to ensure that the regional decision-making needs are met, first and foremost.
In  addition  to  the  above  ‘‘no-regrets’’  options,  there  is  the  option  of  mitigating—

or reducing—the likely impacts of climate change on U.S. water supply:
(4)  Create  policy  that  reduces  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Current
state-of-the-art  climate  science  indicates  that  a  tighter  water  supply  could  occur  in
many parts of our nation due to climate change. Large temperature increases, great-

er atmospheric demand for moisture, increasing snow reductions, river flow declines,
and  a  likely  increase  in  the  probability  of  drought,  all  appear  to  be  already  under-
way  in  some  parts  of  the  globe,  including  the  U.S.  Climate  model  projections  indi-
cate that these trends will likely create an increasing challenge to water supply into
the  future,  to  2100  and  beyond.  A  national  climate  service  (see  #3  above)  would
serve  to  quantify  the  levels  of  climate-related  water  reductions  that  can  be  met
through  technology,  planning  and  adaptation.  Beyond  any  ‘‘adaptable’’  level  of  cli-
mate  change-related  water  supply  reduction,  however,  exists  potentially  dangerous
levels  of  climate  change  that  can  be  avoided  through  an  aggressive  effort  to  reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.

Summary

The  outlook  for  climate-related  changes  in  U.S.  water  supply  is  not  positive,  par-
ticularly in the West, Southwest, Texas and into the Southeast. Even in other parts
of  the  Nation,  water  supply  could  become  more  limiting.  However,  the  good  news
is  that  there  is  time  to  prepare  for  increasing  water  supply  challenge,  and  to  also
avoid  water  supply  reduction  threats  deemed  dangerous.  Urgent  attention  is  war-
ranted.

Thank you for the opportunity to address you today.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ROBERT  C.  WILKINSON,  DIRECTOR,
WATER POLICY PROGRAM, DONALD BREN SCHOOL OF ENVI-
RONMENTAL  SCIENCE  AND  MANAGEMENT,  UNIVERSITY  OF
CALIFORNIA–SANTA BARBARA
Dr.  WILKINSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Chairman  Gordon,
Members  of  the  Committee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  share
some  thoughts  with  you  today.  I  have  got  some  Power  Points,  and
I will try to click through them quickly.

Let  me  start  with  the  four  points  I  would  like  to  make.  Inte-
grated  policy  and  planning  I  am  going  to  pitch,  and  I  have  in  my
written testimony that we couple the science and technology assets
that we have with policy processes. Multiple benefit strategies, de-
signs for flexibility, and put it all in a climate change context.

This  is  a  map  of  total  water  withdrawals  in  the  U.S.,  and  I  will
draw  your  attention  to  the  little  mountains  off  on  the  right-hand
side  of  the  picture.  Most  of  those  are  thermal  power  plants.  I  was
asked  to  address  the  water  energy  nexus,  and  so  there  is  a  dif-
ferentiation  here  between  the  east  and  the  west  to  some  extent  as
to what we are withdrawing water for in different areas.

Many  water  systems  in  the  U.S.  are  already  over-allocated  and
stressed.  Every  major  supply  system  in  California  is  already  over-
allocated.

Here  is  a  population  growth  map  and  water  resources,  and  you
can  see  even  in  areas  that  are  marked  in  blue  in  terms  of  water
resources  when  we  look  at  the  drought  monitor  for  the  U.S.  Jona-
than  has  in  his  presentation  the  same  map  for  two  months  later,
almost  exactly,  drawn  from  the  current  map  here  in  May,  it  looks
almost  identical,  so  you  can  see  some  of  that  tremendous  drought
in  the  Southeast  is  occurring  in  areas  that  until  recently  many
thought  were  wet  and  somewhat  immune  to  the  same  kind  of
droughts.

Nearly  20  years  ago  two  of  the  stars  in  the  field  of  climate
science, Roger Evall and Paul Wagoner, made a very important ob-
servation.  Governments  at  all  levels  should  reevaluate  legal,  tech-
nical,  and  economic  procedures  for  managing  water  resources  in
the light of climate changes that are highly likely.

Indeed, we are seeing those changes unfold, and we need to visit,
again, our institutions and legal frameworks as well as our science
and technical capacity.

Just  a  quick  little  bit  of  history  of  where  we  were  only  50  years
ago  in  our  thinking  about  water  resource  management.  This  is  a
map of North America. You will see in the upper left the water col-
lection  region.  Coming  down  through  the  water  transfer  region  it
was  thought  that  Oregon  and  Washington  didn’t  need  much,  and
we  will  distribute  it  down  in  the  Southwest  and  be  very  generous
right on across the Mexican border. And you will see in the middle
of  the  picture  the  optional  water  distribution  region,  maybe  even
share some there.

This was a serious plan. Here is the plumbing for that plan, and
that was the way we were thinking about managing water through
inter-basin  transfers  only  50  years  ago.  A  lot  of  thinking  has
changed  from  the  idea  of  building  facilities  in  the  West  in  par-
ticular  with  surface  storage,  with  conveyance  systems.  We  have
some  remarkable  engineering  and  remarkable  systems,  but  we  are
having  difficulty  with  the  match  between  hydrology  and  those  sys-
tems providing for our needs.

What  we  need  is  integrated  whole-system  approaches  to  water
and  energy  management  in  the  context  of  science  and  technology,
of  climate  change,  economics,  and  environmental  concerns.  We
need  policy  strategies  that  are  designed  to  tap  multiple  benefits
and are flexible in the face of changing circumstances.

So let me briefly go through then some energy observations here.
About  nineteen  percent  of  California’s  electricity  (I  am  going  to
focus here on California, if I may) and about a third of our natural
gas goes to water. In fact, water is the top use of electricity in Cali-
fornia.  Now,  our  systems,  as  you  can  see  ground  water  and  local
water projects, actually provide the majority of water, but we have
major plumbing facilities as well.

I will run you through the State project very quickly. That is the
red  line  on  this  map.  Here  is  all  the  pumping  plants  for  that  sys-
tem.  Here  is  one  of  them,  the  largest  pumping  plant  in  the  world.
That is only half of it at the foot of the Tehachapi Mountains, and
this  is  what  it  looks  like  as  we  plot  out  all  of  the  energy  inputs  to
those systems.

Putting that on a bar chart, the red bars are the inner-base and
transfer  points,  including  the  Colorado  River  Aqueduct  and  the

State Water Project. You will note that they exceed ocean water de-
salination in terms of energy intensity already. Energy intensity is
the total amount of energy embodied in water used in a particular
place.

We  run  through  a  calculation,  California  has  been  doing  quite  a
bit of this work now, to figure out every step in that water process
and then to understand opportunities to manage it differently.

Here is one of the largest uses as you can see, single families for
the  U.S.,  not  just  California,  and  then  going  to  the,  half  this  resi-
dential, half of that is outdoors, half is indoors. Here is California’s
official State water plan, and here are the sources of water for the
next  quarter  century.  I  will  draw  your  attention  to  the  bar  on  the
right.  Urban  water  use  efficiency,  doing  something  about  that
water  use  on  the  demand  side  is  where  we  expect  to  get  most  of
our  water  in  the  future,  along  with  conjunctive  management  and
recycled water. Those are the big ones.

I am going to skip through because my time is out, but here are
some  of  those  opportunities  for  water  management  that  are  going
to  provide  the  new  water  supplies,  at  least  according  to  our  State
planning  process  in  California.  Coupled  to  that  is  capturing  storm
water  in  different  techniques  that  are  often  simple  but  very  effec-
tive, recycling water, going to hi-tech filtration, reverse osmosis for
different sources.

And  then  going  to  the  flip  of  that  very  quickly,  the  water  inten-
sity  of  energy,  actually  energy,  thermal  energy  facilities  are  the
largest use of water withdrawn in the United States along with ag-
riculture  over  a  third  and  about  a  three  percent  of  total  consump-
tion.

The federal labs are doing a lot of work on this. Analysis is indi-
cating that we have got lots of opportunities to produce energy with
very  little  or  no  water,  and  we  have  other  opportunities  that  use
tremendous amounts of water. So we have choices to make.

Quick  conclusions  then.  Water  scarcity  and  quality  will  remain
key  issues.  Vast  opportunities  do  exist,  though,  for  efficiency  im-
provements.  Science  and  technology  are  critically  important  in  ad-
dressing water supply quality challenges but policy design and im-
plementation  is  equally  as  important.  So  integrated  whole-system
planning  and  designing  policies  and  infrastructure  for  flexibility
and multiple benefits.

I pose two questions in my written testimony. How can we decou-
ple water and energy systems where there are high costs, stresses,
damages,  or  vulnerabilities  to  systems,  and  how  can  we  maximize
water  and  energy  efficiency  and  productivity  so  as  to  maximize
benefits to society?

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT C. WILKINSON

The  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  of  the  United  States  House  of  Rep-
resentatives has chosen a critically important topic with this hearing on Water Sup-
ply  Challenges  for  the  21st  Century.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  share  some
information and ideas with you today.

I will focus on the water/energy nexus as it relates to science and technology, and
also as it relates to policy design and implementation. The selection and implemen-
tation  of  policy  instruments  to  address  water  and  energy  management  challenges
is  integrally  linked  to  the  foundation  provided  by  science  and  technology.  Policy

frameworks are important in achieving positive outcomes based on our investments
in science and technology.

The two main points I would like to convey today involve the need for:

1. Integrated, whole-system approaches to water and energy management in the
context  of  science  and  technology,  climate  change,  economics,  and  environ-
mental concerns, and;

2. Policy  strategies  that  are  designed  to  tap  multiple  benefits  and  are  flexible

in the face of changing circumstances.

Due  to  the  importance  of  the  climate  change  context  for  both  water  and  energy,
I  provide  brief  comments  on  water/energy/climate  links  and  tie  them  specifically  to
science and technology policy developments, particularly at the State level.

This testimony presents both detailed California examples and U.S.-wide data and
considerations.  Because  we  have  developed  good  data  and  analyses  of  some  of  the
water/energy/climate  challenges  in  California,  I  will  focus  in  this  testimony  on  spe-
cifics from the state. The methodology and many of the lessons may be extrapolated
to other parts of the country.

The Water and Energy Context

Water  use  for  urban  and  agricultural  purposes  around  the  world  has  been  facili-
tated  through  diversions  of  surface  water  and  extraction  of  groundwater  delivered
through conveyance systems. Both water and energy are often transported over long
distances from their sources to the place where they are ultimately used. As techno-
logical  capacity  developed  over  the  past  century,  surface  water  diversions,  ground-
water  extraction,  and  conveyance  systems  increased  in  volume  and  geographic  ex-
tent. Interbasin transfers supplemented water available within natural hydrological
basins  or  watersheds.  Agricultural  and  urban  uses  of  arid  lands  were  vastly  ex-
tended by imported water. Similarly, energy systems have evolved from largely local
sources a century ago to continent-wide electricity grids and pipeline networks, and
to global supply-lines.

Rainfall  patterns  in  the  United  States  vary  widely.  In  Las  Vegas,  the  driest  of
America’s major cities, precipitation averages barely four inches (102 mm) per year.
Portland,  Oregon  has  nine  times  the  precipitation  of  Las  Vegas.  Miami,  Florida  is
doused with over 55 inches (1,397 mm) per year, and the Northeast usually receives
above 75 inches (1,778 mm) per year.

Generally,  states  east  of  the  Mississippi  have  been  assumed  to  have  abundant
water  resources  for  water  supply  purposes.  Recent  droughts  and  shortages  in  Flor-
ida  and  the  Southeast  as  well  as  other  parts  of  the  ‘‘wet’’  east  are  changing  this
perception.  West  of  the  Mississippi,  and  particularly  west  of  the  Rocky  Mountains,
federally  subsidized  engineered  systems  of  large  dams  and  aqueducts  or  pipelines
provide  water  supplies  to  many  users.  These  systems  were  constructed  during  the
1900s,  motivated  primarily  by  droughts  that  occurred  periodically.  Today,  the
sources of water for these facilities are over-allocated, and ‘‘new’’ future supplies are
increasingly  coming  from  improved  water-use  efficiency  and  recycling  rather  than
from expensive new water supply development projects.

The  focus  of  technology  development  and  policy  for  much  of  the  past  century  has
been on the supply side of both the energy and water equations. That is, the empha-
sis was on extracting, storing, converting, and conveying water and energy from nat-
ural systems to users. Water and energy policy throughout the world has generally
been  designed  to  facilitate  the  development  and  use  of  these  supply-side  tech-
nologies.  In  the  last  quarter  century,  however,  scientific  developments  and  techno-
logical  innovation  has  increasingly  been  applied  to  improvement  of  the  efficiency  of
use  of  energy  and  water  resources.  (‘‘Efficiency’’  as  used  here  describes  the  useful
work  or  service  provided  by  a  given  amount  of  water  or  energy.)  Significant  poten-
tial  economic  as  well  as  environmental  benefits  can  be  cost-effectively  achieved
through efficiency improvements in water and energy systems. Various technologies,
from  electric  motors  and  lighting  systems  to  pumps  and  plumbing  fixtures  have
vastly improved end-use efficiencies.

Today,  the  main  constraints  on  water  extractions  are  not  technology  limitations.
Indeed,  there  is  significant  spare  capacity  for  pumping  and  conveyance  in  many
areas.  The  limits  are  increasingly  imposed  by  competing  claims  on  scarce  water  re-

ronmental impacts.

Costs  of  building  and  maintaining  infrastructure  have  also  risen  dramatically.
The maintenance cost for existing water and wastewater systems is staggering. The

systems  (about  $20  billion)  in  the  United  States.1 They  also  indicate  a  need  for
about  $1  billion  per  year  to  repair  unsafe  non-federal  dams,  the  number  of  which
has increased by a third in the past decade.2

The  focus  of  technology  development  and  implementation  policy  to  meet  water
needs  is  therefore  increasingly  on  more  efficient  use  and  on  water  treatment  tech-
nologies.  Innovation  and  development  of  technology  in  the  areas  of  end-use  water
applications  and  water  treatment  has  progressed  rapidly.  Techniques  and  tech-
nologies  ranging  from  laser  leveling  of  fields  and  drip  irrigation  systems  to  the  im-
proved  design  of  plumbing  fixtures,  industrial  processes,  and  treatment  technology
have changed the demand side of the water equation. End-uses of water now require
much  less  volume  to  provide  equivalent  or  superior  services.  Rainwater  capture  for
groundwater  recharge  and  other  innovative  water  capture  strategies  are  also  en-
hancing  water  supply  reliability.  Water  supply  systems  (e.g.,  treatment  and  dis-
tribution)  are  also  becoming  more  efficient.  For  example,  geographical  information
systems  (GIS)  and  field  technologies  allow  for  improved  capabilities  to  locate  leaks
in buried pipes.

The Climate Change Context for Water Policy

Climate  change  poses  important  water  and  energy  management  challenges.
Science  is  indicating  that  the  rate  and  magnitude  of  warming  and  related  impacts
are  increasing.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change’s  (IPCC’s)  Fourth
Assessment  Report  in  2007  projected  that  the  rate  of  warming  over  the  21st  cen-
tury—up  to  11.5  degrees  Fahrenheit—would  be  much  greater  than  the  observed
changes  during  the  20th  century.  The  report  also  confirmed  that  ‘‘11  of  the  last  12
years (1995 to 2006) rank among the twelve warmest years . . . since 1850.’’ 3 (The
year 2007 has now registered as the second hottest year, extending the trend.) The
IPCC projects the following changes as a result of increased temperatures:4

• more frequent hot extremes, heat waves, and heavy precipitation events
• more intense hurricanes and typhoons
• decreases in snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, and sea ice
• rise  in  global  mean  sea  level  of  seven  to  23  inches,  however  this  projection

does not include accelerated ice sheet melting and other factors.

Climate models consistently indicate a warmer future for the U.S. West. Evidence
of  warming  trends  is  already  being  seen  in  winter  temperatures  in  the  Sierra  Ne-
vada,  which  rose  by  almost  two  degrees  Celsius  (four  degrees  Fahrenheit)  during
the  second  half  of  the  20th  century.  Trends  toward  earlier  snowmelt  and  runoff  to
the  Sacramento–San  Joaquin  Delta  over  the  same  period  have  also  been  detected.5
Water  managers  are  particularly  concerned  with  the  mid-range  elevation  levels
where  snow  shifts  to  rain  under  warmer  conditions,  thereby  reducing  snow-water
storage.  California’s  Department  of  Water  Resources,  along  with  the  California  En-
ergy  Commission,  has  been  tracking  the  climate  change  science  since  the  1980s.6
California  law  states  clearly  that  ‘‘Global  warming  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the
economic  well-being,  public  health,  natural  resources,  and  the  environment  of  Cali-
fornia.’’ 7 The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  and  variability  to  California  are
serious.8 Integrated  policy,  planning,  and  management  of  water  resources  and  en-

ergy  systems  can  provide  important  opportunities  to  respond  effectively  to  chal-
lenges posed by climate change. Both mitigation (i.e., reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions)  and  adaptation  (dealing  with  impacts)  strategies  are  being  developed.  While
both energy and water managers have used integrated planning approaches for dec-
ades, the broader integration of water and energy management in the context of cli-
mate change is a relatively new and exciting policy area.

Integrating Water and Energy Policy

Government agencies at various levels are currently integrating water and energy
policies  to  respond  to  climate  change  as  well  as  to  environmental  challenges  and
economic  imperatives.  Water  and  energy  systems  are  interconnected  in  important
ways. Developed water systems provide energy (e.g., through hydropower), and they
consume energy through pumping, thermal, and other processes. Government agen-
cies  are  looking  at  water  delivery  system  and  end-use  water  efficiency  improve-
ments,  source  switching  (e.g.,  using  recycled  water  for  industry  and  irrigation),  im-
proved rainwater capture and groundwater recharge, and other measures that save
energy by reducing pumping and other energy inputs. Recent studies are indicating
significant  opportunities  in  each  area.9 Several  California  examples  of  coupled
science/technology/policy  approaches  are  presented  here.  While  they  are  specific  to
the state, many of the basic features are similar in other states across the U.S.

New  approaches  to  the  integration  of  water,  energy,  and  climate  change  policy
and  planning,  including  policy  processes  at  the  state’s  Energy  Commission,  Public
Utilities  Commission,  Department  of  Water  Resources,  Water  Resources  Control
Board,  and  Air  Resources  Board,  are  being  developed.  Methodologies  to  account  for
embedded  energy  in  water  systems—from  initial  extraction  through  treatment,  dis-
tribution,  end-use,  wastewater  treatment  and  discharge—and  water  use  by  energy
systems,  have  been  developed  and  are  outlined  below.10 Institutional  collaboration
between energy, water, and other management authorities is also evolving.

Water is now recognized as the largest electricity use in California. Water systems
account  for  approximately  19  percent  of  total  electricity  use  and  about  33  percent
of  the  non-power  plant  natural  gas  use  in  the  state.11 The  California  Energy  Com-
mission  (CEC)  and  the  California  Public  Utilities  Commission  (CPUC)  have  both
concluded that energy embedded in water presents large untapped opportunities for
cost-effectively  improving  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)
emissions.  The  CEC  commented  in  its  2005  Integrated  Energy  Policy  Report  that:
‘‘The  Energy  Commission,  the  Department  of  Water  Resources,  the  CPUC,  local
water  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders  should  explore  and  pursue  cost-effective
water  efficiency  opportunities  that  would  save  energy  and  decrease  the  energy  in-
tensity  in  the  water  sector.’’ 12 Fortunately  this  corresponds  with  the  state’s  2005
Water Plan.13

The  California  Energy  Commission’s  staff  report,  California’s  Water—Energy  Re-
lationship,  notes  that:  ‘‘In  many  respects,  the  2005  Water  Plan  Update  mirrors  the

mission’s Integrated Energy Policy Report 2005 and the multi-agency Energy Action
Plan.’’ 14

One of the top recommendations in the California Energy Commission’s 2005 Inte-
grated Energy Policy Report (IEPR) is as follows: ‘‘The Energy Commission strongly
supports  the  following  energy  efficiency  and  demand  response  recommendations:
The  CPUC,  Department  of  Water  Resources,  the  Energy  Commission,  local  water
agencies  and  other  stakeholders  should  assess  efficiency  improvements  in  hot  and
cold  water  use  in  homes  and  businesses,  and  include  these  improvements  in  2006–
2008 programs.’’ It observes that ‘‘Reducing the demand for energy is the most effec-
tive way to reduce energy costs and bolster California’s economy.’’ 15

Improvements  in  urban  water  use  efficiency  have  been  identified  by  the  Depart-
ment  of  Water  Resources  in  its  official  State  Water  Plan  as  the  largest  new  water
supply  for  the  next  quarter  century,  followed  by  groundwater  management  and
reuse.  The  following  graph  indicates  the  critical  role  water  use  efficiency,  ground-
water  recharge  and  management,  and  reuse  will  play  in  California’s  water  future.

The  CEC  staff  report  notes  that,  ‘‘As  California  continues  to  struggle  with  its
many  critical  energy  supply  and  infrastructure  challenges,  the  state  must  identify
and address the points of highest stress. At the top of this list is California’s water-
energy  relationship.’’ 16 It  continues  with  this  interesting  finding:  ‘‘The  state  can
meet  energy  and  demand-reduction  goals  comparable  to  those  already  planned  by
the state’s investor-owned energy utilities for the 2006–2008 program period by sim-
ply  recognizing  the  value  of  the  energy  saved  for  each  unit  of  water  saved.  If  al-
lowed  to  invest  in  these  cold  water  energy  savings,  energy  utilities  could  co-invest
in  water  use  efficiency  programs,  which  would  in  turn  supplement  water  utilities’
efforts  to  meet  as  much  load  growth  as  possible  through  water  efficiency.  Remark-

ably,  staff’s  initial  assessment  indicates  that  this  benefit  could  be  realized  at  less
than  half  the  cost  to  electric  rate  payers  of  traditional  energy  efficiency  meas-
ures.’’ 17

This  finding  is  consistent  with  an  earlier  analysis  which  found  that  energy  use
for  conveyance,  including  interbasin  water  transfer  systems  (systems  that  move
water from one watershed to another) in California, accounted for about 6.9 percent
of  the  state’s  electricity  consumption.18 Estimates  by  CEC’s  Public  Interest  Energy
Research—Industrial,  Agriculture  and  Water  (PIER–IAW)  experts  indicate  that
‘‘total  energy  used  to  pump  and  treat  this  water  exceeds  15,000  GWh  per  year,  or
at least 6.5 percent of the total electricity used in the state per year.’’ They also note
that  the  State  Water  Project  (SWP)—the  state-owned  storage  and  conveyance  sys-
tem  that  transfers  water  from  Northern  California  to  various  parts  of  the  state  in-
cluding Southern California—is the largest single user of electricity in the state, ac-
counting  for  two  percent  to  three  percent  of  all  the  electricity  consumed  in  Cali-
fornia and using an average of 5,000 GWh per year.19

The  magnitude  of  these  figures  suggests  that  failing  to  include  embedded  energy
in  water  and  wastewater  systems,  and  failing  to  tap  energy  saving  derived  from
water efficiency improvements would be a policy opportunity lost.

Tapping Integrated Water/Energy Opportunities

Elements  of  typical  water  infrastructures  are  energy  intensive.  Moving  large
quantities of water long distances and over significant elevation gains, treating and
distributing it within communities, using it for various purposes, and collecting and
treating  the  resulting  wastewater,  accounts  for  one  of  the  largest  uses  of  electrical
energy in many areas.20

Water systems include extraction of ‘‘raw’’ (untreated) water supplies from natural
sources,  conveyance,  treatment,  storage,  distribution,  end-uses,  and  wastewater
treatment.  The  total  energy  embodied  in  a  unit  of  water  used  in  a  particular  place
varies with location, source, and use.

There are four principle energy elements of water systems:

1. primary water extraction, conveyance, and storage
2. treatment and distribution within service areas
3. on-site  water  pumping,  treatment,  and  thermal  inputs  (heating  and  cooling)
4. wastewater collection, treatment and discharge

Pumping  water  in  each  of  these  stages  is  energy-intensive.  Other  important  en-
ergy  inputs  include  thermal  energy  (heating  and  cooling)  applications  at  the  point
of end-use, and aeration in wastewater treatment processes.

1. Primary  water  extraction,  conveyance,  and  storage.  Extracting  and
lifting  water  is  highly  energy  intensive.  Surface  water  and  groundwater
pumping  requires  significant  amounts  of  energy  depending  on  the  depth  of
the source. Where water is stored in intermediate facilities, net energy is re-
quired to store and then recover the water.

2. Treatment  and  distribution  within  service  areas.  Within  local  service
areas, water is treated, pumped, and pressurized for distribution. Local con-
ditions  and  sources  determine  both  the  treatment  requirements  and  the  en-
ergy required for pumping and pressurization. Some distribution systems are
gravity-driven, while others require pumping.

3. On-site  water  pumping,  treatment,  and  thermal  inputs.  Individual
water users require energy to further treat water supplies (e.g., softeners, fil-
ters,  etc.),  circulate  and  pressurize  water  supplies  (e.g.,  building  circulation
pumps), and heat and cool water for various purposes.

4. Wastewater collection, treatment, and discharge. Finally, wastewater is
collected  and  treated  by  a  wastewater  system  (unless  a  septic  system  or
other  alternative  is  being  used)  and  discharged.  Wastewater  is  sometimes
pumped  to  treatment  facilities  where  gravity  flow  is  not  possible,  and  the
standard  treatment  processes  require  energy  for  pumping,  aeration,  and
other processes.

The  simplified  flow  chart21 below  illustrates  the  steps  in  the  water  system  proc-

ess.

The  energy  intensity  of  water  varies  considerably  by  geographic  location  of  both
end-users  and  sources.  Water  use  in  certain  places  is  highly  energy-intensive  due
to the combined requirements of conveyance over long distances and elevation lifts,
treatment and distribution, and wastewater collection and treatment processes. Im-
portant work already undertaken by various government agencies, professional asso-
ciations,  private  sector  users,  and  non-governmental  organizations  in  the  area  of
combined  end-use  efficiency  strategies  has  demonstrated  considerable  potential  for
improvement. Significant and profitable energy efficiency gains are possible through
implementation of cost-effective water efficiency improvements.

The Energy Intensity of Water in California: A Case Study

California’s  water  systems  are  uniquely  energy-intensive  due  in  large  part  to  the
pumping  requirements  of  major  conveyance  systems  which  move  large  volumes  of
water long distances and over thousands of feet in elevation. Some interbasin trans-

fer  systems  such  as  California’s  State  Water  Project  (SWP)  and  the  Colorado  River
Aqueduct (CRA) require large amounts of electrical energy to convey water.

Water  use  (based  on  embedded  energy)  is  the  second  or  third  largest  consumer
of electricity in a typical Southern California home after refrigerators and air condi-
tioners.22 The  electricity  required  to  support  water  service  in  the  typical  home  in
Southern California is estimated to be between 14 percent to 19 percent of total res-
idential  energy  demand.23 The  Metropolitan  Water  District  of  Southern  California
(MWD)  reached  similar  findings,  estimating  that  energy  requirements  to  deliver
water  to  residential  customers  equals  as  much  as  33  percent  of  the  total  average
household  electricity  use.24 Nearly  three  quarters  of  this  energy  demand  is  for
pumping imported water.

Water  system  operations  pose  a  number  of  challenges  for  energy  systems  due  to
factors  such  as  large  loads  for  specific  facilities,  time  and  season  of  use,  and  geo-
graphic distribution of loads. Pumping plants are among the largest electrical loads
in the state. For example, the SWP’s Edmonston Pumping Plant, situated at the foot
of  the  Tehachapi  Mountains,  pumps  water  1,926  feet  (the  highest  single  lift  of  any
pumping  plant  in  the  world)  and  is  the  largest  single  user  of  electricity  in  the
state.25 In  total,  the  SWP  system  is  the  largest  user  of  electricity  in  the  state.26 A
study  for  the  Electric  Power  Research  Institute  by  Franklin  Burton  found  that  at
a  national  level,  water  systems  account  for  an  estimated  75  billion  kWh  per  year
(about three percent of total electricity demand).27

The  schematic  below  shows  the  cumulative  net  energy,  and  the  incremental  en-
ergy inputs or outputs, at each of the pumping and energy recovery facilities of the
SWP. (Energy recovery is indicated with negative numbers, which reduce net energy
at that point in the system.)

Approximately 5,418 kWh are required to pump one acre-foot of SWP water from
the  Sacramento-San  Joaquin  Delta  to  Cherry  Valley  on  the  East  Branch,  2,580
kWh/af at Castaic on the West Branch, and 2,826 kWh/af to Polonio on the Coastal
Branch.  Approximately  2,000  kWh/af  is  required  to  pump  Colorado  River  water  to
Southern California.28 This is raw (untreated) water delivered to those points. From
there  conveyance  continues  by  gravity  or  pumping  to  treatment  and  distribution
within service areas.

Note that at certain points in the system the energy intensity is high because the
service  areas  are  located  at  higher  elevations.  At  Pearblossom  (4,444  kWh/af)  raw
water supplies are roughly equivalent to estimates for desalinated ocean water sys-
tems. (Ocean desalination is estimated at 4,400 kWh/af based on work by the author
for the California Desalination Task Force.) At Crafton Hill and Cherry Valley, the
energy  intensity  of  imported  water  is  well  in  excess  of  current  estimates  of  ocean
desalination.

The following graph shows the energy intensity of major water supply options for

actual inland and coastal locations in Southern California.

Each  bar  represents  the  energy  intensity  of  a  specific  water  supply  source  at  se-
lected locations in Southern California. The data is presented in kWh/af. Water con-
servation—e.g.,  not  using  water  in  the  first  place—avoids  additional  energy  inputs
along all segments of the water use cycle. Consequently, water use efficiency is the
superior water resource option from an energy perspective (and typically from a cost
perspective as well). For all other water resources, there are ranges of actual energy
inputs  that  depend  on  many  factors,  including  the  quality  of  source  water,  the  en-
ergy intensity of the technologies used to treat the source water to standards needed
by  end-users,  the  distance  water  needs  to  be  transported  to  reach  end-users,  and
the efficiency of the conveyance, distribution, and treatment facilities and systems.29
Note that improved efficiency (e.g., fixing leaks, replacing inefficient plumbing fix-
tures  and  irrigation  systems,  and  other  cost-effective  measures)  requires  no  water
system  energy  inputs.  Next  to  water  conservation,  recycled  water  and  groundwater
are  lower  energy  intensity  options  than  most  other  water  resources  in  many  areas
of California.30 Even with advanced treatment to deal with salts and other contami-
nants (the blue and green bars), recycled water and groundwater usually require far
less energy than the untreated imported water (red bars) and seawater desalination
(yellow  bars).  The  Chino  desalter,  a  reverse  osmosis  (RO)  treatment  process  pro-
viding high-quality potable water from contaminated groundwater (the energy figure
above includes groundwater pumping and RO filtration) is far less energy intensive
than  any  of  the  imported  raw  water.  From  an  energy  standpoint,  greater  reliance
on  water  conservation,  reuse  and  groundwater  provides  significant  benefits.  From
a greenhouse gas emissions standpoint, these energy benefits provide significant po-
tential emissions reduction benefits in direct relation to their energy savings.

Groundwater  pumping  energy  requirements  vary  depending  on  the  lift  required.

groundwater is unknown due to the lack of complete information on well-depth and
groundwater  use.  DWR  has  estimated  groundwater  use  and  average  well  depths  in
three  areas  responsible  for  almost  two-thirds  of  the  groundwater  used  in  the  state:
the Tulare Lake basin, the San Joaquin River basin, and the Central Coast region.
Based  on  these  estimates,  energy  used  for  groundwater  pumping  in  these  areas
would  average  2,250  GWh  per  year  at  a  70  percent  pumping  efficiency  (1.46  kWh/
acre-foot/foot  of  lift).  In  the  Tulare  Lake  area,  with  an  average  well  depth  of  120
feet,  pumping  would  require  175  kWh  per  acre-foot  of  water.  In  the  San  Joaquin
River and Central Coast areas, with average well depths of 200 feet, pumping would
require  292  kWh  per  acre-foot  of  water.’’ 31 Analysis  of  these  different  sources  pro-
vides  a  reasonably  consistent  result:  Local  groundwater  and  recycled  water  are  far
less energy intensive than imported water or ocean desalination.

The energy intensity of most water supply sources may increase in the future due
to  increased  concerns  regarding  water  quality.32 It  is  worth  noting  that  advanced
treatment  systems  such  as  RO  facilities  that  are  being  used  to  treat  groundwater,
reclaimed  supplies,  and  ocean  water  have  already  absorbed  most  of  the  energy  im-
pacts of higher levels of treatment. By contrast, some of the raw water supplies may
require larger incremental energy inputs in the future for treatment. This may fur-
ther advantage the local sources.

Policy  Implications:  Tapping  Multiple  Benefits  Through  Integrated  Plan-

ning

When the costs and benefits of a proposed policy or action are analyzed, we typi-
cally focus on accounting for costs, and then we compare those costs with a specific,
well-defined  benefit  such  as  an  additional  increment  of  water  supply.  We  often  fail
to  account  for  other  important  benefits  that  accrue  from  well-planned  investments
that  solve  for  multiple  objectives.  With  a  focus  on  multiple  benefits,  we  account  for
various  goals  achieved  through  a  single  investment.  For  example,  improvements  in
water  use  efficiency—meeting  the  same  end-use  needs  with  less  water—also  typi-
cally provides related benefits such as reduced energy requirements for water pump-
ing  and  treatment  (with  reduced  pollution  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  related  to
energy production as a result), and reduced water and wastewater infrastructure ca-
pacity (capital costs) and processing (operating costs) requirements. Impacts caused
by extraction of source water from surface or groundwater systems are also reduced.
Water  managers  often  do  not  receive  credit  for  providing  these  multiple  benefits
when they implement water efficiency, recharge, and reuse strategies. From both an
investment perspective, and from the standpoint of public policy, the multiple bene-
fits  of  efficiency  improvements  and  recharge  and  reuse  should  be  fully  included  in
cost/benefit analysis.

Policies that account for the full embedded energy of water use have the potential
to provide significant additional public and private sector benefits. Economic and en-
vironmental  benefits  are  potentially  available  through  new  policy  approaches  that
properly account for the energy intensity of water.

Energy  savings  may  be  achieved  both  upstream  and  downstream  of  the  point  of
use  when  the  energy  consumption  of  both  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment
systems are taken into account. Methods, metrics, and data are available to provide
a  solid  foundation  for  policy  approaches  to  account  for  energy  savings  from  water
efficiency improvements, though can and should be improved. Policies can be based
on methodologies and metrics that are already established.

Policy Precedents and the Role of Government

Water and energy are currently regulated by government because there is a com-
pelling public interest in oversight and management of these critical resources. En-
couraging  and  requiring  the  efficient  use  of  both  water  and  energy  is  a  well-estab-
lished  part  of  the  policy  mandate  under  which  government  agencies  operate.  Ineffi-
cient  use  of  water  and  energy  leads  to  public  and  private  costs  to  the  economy  and
the environment. The public interest in resource-use efficiency relates directly to en-
vironmental  impacts  and  public  welfare.  This  is  why  we  have  efficiency  standards
for  energy  and  water  resources.  Water-using  devices,  like  energy-using  devices,  are
often regulated through various policy measures including efficiency standards.

Policy  regarding  both  energy  and  water  already  addresses  water  use  and  related
embedded  energy  use.  For  example,  the  U.S.  Energy  Policy  Act  of  1992  set  stand-
ards  for  the  maximum  water  use  of  toilets,  urinals,  showerheads,  and  faucets.  (See
Table  below.)  Why  does  the  U.S.  Energy  Act  include  standards  for  water  use?  It  is
because  the  energy  required  to  convey,  treat,  and  deliver  potable  water  supplies,
and  the  energy  required  to  collect,  treat,  and  discharge  the  resulting  wastewater,
is  significant.  The  energy  savings  resulting  from  water  efficiency  are  also  signifi-
cant.

These  standards  became  effective  in  1994  for  residential  and  commercial  plumb-
ing  fixtures,  although  the  commercial  water  closet  standard  was  not  required  until
1997 because of uncertainties regarding performance of the fixtures. In this respect,
the  United  States  is  well  behind  certain  countries  of  Europe,  where  the  six-liter
water closet has been in use for many years and where horizontal axis washing ma-
chines are more common than in the United States.

In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed a reauthorization of the Federal Safe Drinking
Water  Act.  For  the  first  time,  Congress  formally  recognized  the  need  for  water  con-
servation  planning  by  allowing  individual  states  to  mandate  conservation  planning
and  implementation  as  a  condition  of  receiving  federal  grants  for  water  supply
treatment  facilities.33 This  was  a  significant  step  for  the  federal  government.  At
about the same time, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation set conservation and efficiency
requirements for those agricultural and urban water agencies that receive federally
subsidized  water  from  the  Bureau  facilities.  This  also  was  a  significant  step.  Other
federal  statutes  create  incentives  for  farmers  and  landowners  to  participate  in  soil
and  water  conservation  programs,  and  to  initiate  voluntary  water  transfers  of  con-
served water.

The significant water efficiency and conservation activity, however, takes place at
the  State  and  regional  levels.  Interest  in  water  efficiency  is  primarily  highest  in
those  regions  of  the  country  where  precipitation  is  lowest,  or  where  wastewater
treatment costs have skyrocketed. Seventeen states, representing over 60 percent of
the  Nation’s  population,  had  already  adopted  their  own  plumbing  efficiency  stand-
ards long before passage of the federal law in 1992. Fifteen states have also adopted
specific  conservation  programs,  which  vary  from  mandating  conservation  planning
by water utilities to requiring actual implementation of specific water efficiency pro-
grams.  The  states  most  active  in  conservation  activities  are:  Arizona;  California;
Colorado;  Connecticut;  Florida;  Kansas;  New  Jersey,  Oregon;  Texas;  and  Wash-
ington  State.34 Individual  cities  have  also  adopted  water  efficiency  programs  where
necessary (New York City, Boston, and Las Vegas are examples).

In  general,  where  water  supply  withdrawals  are  regulated  by  State  agencies,
water conservation is usually a prominent planning requirement for water utilities.
A  number  of  states  not  only  require  plans  of  their  water  utilities,  but  also  require
that  progress  be  demonstrated  in  water  efficiency  programs  before  approvals  for
continued  water  supply  withdrawals  are  given.  Many  states  also  condition  State
grants  for  new  facility  construction  upon  a  satisfactory  demonstration  of  conserva-
tion planning and implementation by the water utility.35

California adopted plumbing standards in 1978 for showerheads and faucets, and
water  closet  standards  in  1992.  Comprehensive  conservation  planning  was  adopted

in  1983  for  all  water  agencies  serving  more  than  3,000  connections  or  3,000  peo-
ple.36 In  a  unique  consensus  partnership,  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  was
signed in 1991 by major water utilities and environmental groups pledging to under-
take water efficiency practices (the ‘‘Best Management Practices’’).37

Environmental  Benefits  of  Integrated  Water  and  Energy  Efficiency  Strate-

gies

Water conservation is a powerful tool in the integrated resource management tool-
box.  By  reducing  the  need  for  new  water  supply  and  additional  wastewater  treat-
ment—particularly  in  areas  of  rapid  population  growth—conserved  water  allows
more  equitable  allocation  of  water  resources  for  other  purposes.  By  way  of  illustra-
tion,  one  estimate  indicates  that  the  installation  of  1.6  gallon  per  flush  toilets  in
the  U.S.  will  save  over  two  billion  gallons  per  day  nationwide  by  the  year  2010.38
These  saved  water  resources  can  be  directed  toward  future  water  supply  growth  or
other uses for the water. It ‘‘stretches’’ the available supply.

Perhaps most significantly, it has become clear in recent decades that the extrac-
tion  and  diversion  of  water  supplies  has  had  major  impacts  on  the  quality  of  the
natural environment and on individual species. Facilities built to dam, divert, trans-
port, pump, and treat water are massive projects that often cause serious and some-
times irreversible environmental impacts.

As  a  result,  water  conservation  is  playing  an  important  role  in  helping  meet  the
environmental  goals  of  many  communities.  Efficiency  programs  have  been  required
in numerous areas to help achieve some of the following results:

• Maintaining habitat along rivers and streams and restoring fisheries;
• Protecting groundwater supplies from excessive depletion and contamination;
• Improving the quality of wastewater discharges;
• Reducing excessive runoff of urban contaminants; and
• Restoring the natural values and functions of wetlands and estuaries.

The Role of Price Signals Coupled With Policy

Attention  has  turned  to  technologies  that  improve  energy  and  water-use  effi-
ciency. From industrial processes to plumbing fixtures and irrigation systems, water
is  being  used  far  more  efficiently  than  in  the  past.  One  reason  the  focus  of  techno-
logical innovation has shifted from supply development to improving efficiency is ec-
onomics.  When  water  is  cheap,  there  is  little  incentive  to  design  and  build  water-
efficient technologies. As the cost of water increases, technology options for reducing
waste  and  providing  greater  end-use  efficiency  become  more  cost-effective  and  even
profitable.  Technologies  for  measuring,  timing,  and  controlling  water  use,  and  new
innovations  in  the  treatment  and  re-use  of  water,  are  growing  areas  of  technology
development and application.

Impetus  for  scientific  inquiry  and  technology  innovation  and  development  has
been provided by both price signals (increasing costs) and public policy (e.g., require-
ments  for  internalization  of  external  costs).  Public  policy  is  increasingly  incor-
porating  these  costs,  including  those  of  climate  change,  into  resource  prices.  As
water and energy prices continue to reflect full costs, including environmental costs
previously externalized, they increase.

At the same time, technology has provided a wide range of options for expanding
the  utility  value  through  efficiencies  (less  water  and  energy  required  to  perform  a
useful service). The ability to treat and reuse water, improve energy efficiency, and
substituting  ways  to  provide  services  previously  performed  by  water  and  energy.
Broader  application  of  these  technologies  and  techniques  can  yield  significant  addi-
tional energy, water, economic, and environmental benefits.

Public  policy  can  be  designed  to  encourage  ‘‘best  management  practices’’  by  both
water  and  energy  suppliers  and  users.  Appliance  efficiency  standards  (for  both  en-
ergy  and  water)  and  minimum  waste  requirements  are  examples.  Policy  measures
have  also  been  used  to  frame  and  guide  market  signals  by  implementing  mecha-
nisms such as increasing tiered pricing structures, meter requirements (some areas
do not even measure use), and other means to utilize simple market principles and
price signals more effectively.

In an economic and resource management sense, efficiency improvements are now
considered as supply options, to the extent that permanent improvements in the de-
mand-side infrastructure provide reliable water and/or energy savings. Most experts
agree  that  coupling  technology  options  such  as  efficient  plumbing  and  energy-using
devices  to  economic  incentives  (e.g.,  rebates)  and  disincentives  (e.g.,  increasing
tiered  rate  structures)  is  the  best  strategy.  The  coupling  provides  both  the  means
to improve productive water and energy use and the incentive to do it.

Seawater Desalination’s Role in Integrated Water Supply Portfolios

Seawater  desalination  has  been  viewed  as  the  ultimate  drought  hedge,  enabling
water  providers  to  augment  water  supplies  with  desalted  ocean  water,  a  virtually
inexhaustible  water  source.  Both  the  theory  and  practice  of  desalination  date  back
to  the  ancient  Greeks  and  perhaps  earlier,  but  costs  have  held  desalination  to  lim-
ited use.

The salinity of ocean water varies, with the average generally exceeding 30 grams
per liter (g/l). The Pacific Ocean is 34–38 g/l, the Atlantic Ocean averages about 35
g/l,  and  the  Persian  Gulf  is  45  g/l.  Brackish  water  drops  to  0.5  to  3.0  g/l.  Potable
water salt levels should be below 0.5 g/l.

Reducing  salt  levels  from  over  30  g/l  to  0.5  g/l  and  lower  (drinking  water  stand-
ards) using existing technologies requires considerable amounts of energy, either for
thermal  processes  or  for  the  pressure  to  drive  water  through  extremely  fine  filters
(RO),  or  for  some  combination  of  thermal  and  pressure  processes.  Recent  improve-
ments in energy efficiency have reduced the amount of thermal and pumping energy
required  for  the  various  processes,  but  high  energy  intensity  is  still  an  issue.  The
energy  required  is  in  part  a  function  of  the  degree  of  salinity  and  the  temperature
of the water.

Seawater desalination is a primary source of water in some countries in the Mid-
dle  East.  It  is  also  becoming  an  important  resource  in  other  countries  including
Spain, Singapore, China, and Australia. A few recent examples include:

plant capable of serving 10 percent of its national water demand.39

• In  2006,  Singapore  completed  a  36  MGD  seawater  reverse  osmosis  (SWRO)
• As  of  2006,  more  than  20  seawater  desalination  plants  were  operating  in
• In  November  2006,  Western  Australia  became  the  first  state  in  the  country

China.40

to use desalination as a major public water source.41

A  number  of  desalination  plants  are  currently  being  planned  or  developed  in  the
U.S.  On  January  25,  2008,  Tampa  Bay  Water  announced  that  it  had  commenced
full operations of its 25 MGD desalination plant, presently the largest seawater de-
salination plant in North America. At full capacity, the plant will provide 10 percent
of the drinking water supply for the Tampa Bay region.42 In 2004, the Texas Water
Development  Board  (TWDB)  identified  desalination  as  an  important  strategy  for
meeting growth in water demand.43 In its 2006 update to the Governor and the Leg-
islature, the TWDB stated that ‘‘Seawater desalination can no longer be considered
a  water  supply  option  available  only  to  communities  along  the  Texas  Gulf  Coast.44
It  must  also  be  considered  as  an  increasingly  viable  water  supply  option  for  major

In  November  2007,  Poseidon  Resources  won  conditional  regulatory  approval  from
the California Coastal Commission to build a $300 million plant north of San Diego.
The  Carlsbad  Desalination  Plant  will  be  the  largest  in  the  western  hemisphere  if
completed  as  planned.  On  its  web  site,  Poseidon  reported  that  most  of  the  plant’s
capacity has already been committed to serve baseload water requirements for local
water agencies.47

Water Inputs to U.S. Energy Systems

The other side of the water/energy nexus is the water intensity of energy. In this
case,  water  inputs  to  energy  systems  are  identified  and  quantified  to  understand
where water is used, and how much is required for different types of energy sources
and services.

Water  inputs  to  energy  systems  are  significant  but  highly  variable.  For  example,
primary  fuels,  such  as  oil,  gas,  and  coal,  often  require  water  for  production,  and
they  sometimes  ‘‘produce’’  water  of  various  qualities  as  a  by-product  of  extraction.
Biofuels  may  require  water  not  only  for  irrigation  of  crops  but  also  for  production
processes.  Electricity  generation  in  thermoelectric  plants  typically  uses  water  for
cooling and other processes, although dry cooling technology exists and is improving.
Some  forms  of  electricity  production  such  as  wind  and  certain  co-generation  proc-
esses require no water at all.

The USGS estimates in its most recent analysis that 48 percent of all U.S. fresh-
water  and  saline-water  withdrawals  were  used  for  thermoelectric  power,  with  the
majority  of  the  fresh  water  extracted  from  surface  sources  (e.g.,  lakes  and  rivers)
and used for once-through cooling at thermal power plants. USGS notes that ‘‘about
52 percent of fresh surface-water withdrawals and about 96 percent of saline-water
withdrawals were for thermoelectric-power use.’’ 48

Water  is  increasingly  viewed  as  a  limiting  factor  for  thermal  power  plant  siting
and operation. Large-scale thermoelectric plants in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere
have experienced serious problems in recent years due to the lack of available cool-
ing  water.  Power  production  was  reduced  or  curtailed  in  Europe  during  the  heat

wave  in  2003,  and  power  plants  in  the  U.S.  have  been  impacted  by  low  water  and
by  elevated  temperatures,  or  both,  during  the  past  decade.  As  recently  as  this  past
winter power plant operators were concerned about the impact of the drought in the
U.S.  Southeast  and  the  potential  for  adverse  impacts  to  thermal  power  plants.  Hy-
droelectric  power  production  is  also  impacted  by  low  water  levels,  including  a  con-
tinuing long-term dry period in the Colorado River basin.

Although cooling systems account for the majority of water used in power genera-
tion,  water  is  also  used  in  other  parts  of  the  process:  water  may  be  used  to  mine,
process, or transport fuels (e.g., coal slurry lines). These processes may have impor-
tant  local  impacts  on  water  resources.  Some  energy  sources  such  as  oil  shale,  tar
sands,  and  marginal  gas  and  petroleum  reserves  may  have  additional  water  needs
and/or significant local impacts on water quality and quantity.

The U.S. National Labs have been working for several years on an ‘‘Energy/Water
Nexus’’  effort.49 A  report  entitled  ‘‘Energy  Demands  on  Water  Resources  Report  to
Congress  on  the  Interdependency  of  Energy  and  Water’’  was  submitted  to  Congress
in  2007.50 As  with  other  analyses  of  the  issue,  the  report  found  that  some  energy
systems  are  highly  dependent  on  large  volumes  of  water  resources  (and  vulnerable
to  disruptions),  while  other  energy  sources  are  independent  of  water.  Further  anal-
ysis of the opportunities for improving resilience and of beneficial decoupling water
and energy are in order.

The  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory  (NETL)  has  developed  several  stud-
ies and reports, including an updated report entitled ‘‘Estimating Freshwater Needs
to  Meet  Future  Thermoelectric  Generation  Requirements’’  in  2007.51 NETL  has
strong  expertise  on  coal  and  thermal  power  production  at  coal-fired  power  plants.
Its  study  indicates  that  water  consumption  is  projected  to  increase  over  a  range  of
scenarios,  while  extraction  is  expected  to  decline.  This  is  due  to  an  expected  shift
away  from  one-through  cooling  systems,  which  cycle  more  extracted  water  through
the  plants,  but  consume  (e.g.,  evaporate)  less  than  recycle  cooling  systems.  The
study  also  indicates  that  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  as  a  strategy  to  reduce
greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  add  significant  water  consumptive  demands  to  coal-
based power production.

Other  studies  from  federal  labs  and  research  institutions  are  exploring  links  be-
tween  energy  systems  and  water  requirements.  The  National  Renewable  Energy
Lab  (NREL),  for  example,  has  been  working  on  the  role  of  renewables  to  reduce
water demands from the energy sector.

A  recent  research  project  by  graduate  students  at  the  University  of  California,
Santa  Barbara  found  that  water  use  for  renewable  forms  of  energy  varies  substan-
tially.52 Solar  photovoltaics,  wind  turbines,  and  landfill  gas-to-energy  projects  re-
quire  very  little  water,  if  any.  Likewise,  geothermal  and  concentrating  solar  power
(CSP) systems that employ dry cooling technology also have minimal water require-
ments.  In  contrast,  irrigated  bio-energy  crops  could  potentially  consume  exponen-
tially  more  water  per  unit  of  electricity  generated  than  thermoelectric  plants.  Geo-
thermal  plants  may  also  have  high  water  requirements,  depending  on  the  geo-
thermal resource and the conversion technology employed. Many geothermal plants,
however,  rely  on  geothermal  fluids  (often  high  in  salts  or  other  minerals).  Finally,
although  reservoirs  often  have  multiple  purposes  (e.g.,  flood  control,  water  storage,
and  recreation),  evaporative  (consumptive)  losses  from  hydroelectric  facilities  per
unit of electricity are higher than many other forms of generation. As the following
graph  indicates,  water  requirements  vary  substantially,  depending  on  the  primary
fuel source and the technology employed.

The  various  water  inputs  to  energy  systems  are,  as  noted,  highly  variable.  It  is
not  at  all  clear  that  meeting  our  energy  needs  requires  large  amounts  of  water,  as
has been the case in the past. Indeed, the data above indicate that we have choices.
An  important  step  in  addressing  the  water  and  energy  challenge  is  to  analyze  the
relationships between them and the technology and policy options.

Recommendations for Further Research and Development

There are of course various approaches to meeting the challenge of water and en-
ergy in the 21st century. I am pleased to have been asked by this committee to pro-
vide some thoughts on directions for research and development.

It  is  always  useful  to  begin  by  examining  the  questions  to  be  addressed.  If  one
asks how to provide low-cost water for energy supplies and low-cost energy for water
supplies,  then  the  question  leads  to  certain  kinds  of  analysis.  This  indeed  is  how
some are framing the question at present.

It  seems  clear  that  both  water  and  energy  are  scarce  in  both  the  economic  and
physical sense, and that there are many competing demands for them. It also seems
self-evident  that  environmental  impacts  (often  externalized  in  the  past),  are  real
and  growing.  One  of  the  most  significant,  but  by  no  means  the  only  one,  is  climate
change.

These observations lead to a conclusion that we should ask a different set of ques-
tions.  It  is  tempting  to  take  this  opportunity  to  deluge  a  Congressional  Committee
with a wish-list of research ideas. Instead, I will start with just two questions:

1. How can we decouple water and energy systems where there are high costs,

stresses, damages, or vulnerabilities to systems?

2. How can we maximize water and energy efficiency and productivity so as to

reduce demands on each and maximize benefits to society?

Of  course  these  questions  involve  important  data  collection  and  analysis  of  sub-
elements of each. To take my first example, we need to identify costs (full costs and
an  accounting  for  distortions—e.g.,  subsidies  and  externalities—at  all  levels),
stresses  (e.g.,  limits  of  systems  and  things  like  the  causes  of,  probabilities  of,  and
consequences of, exceeding those limits), potential economic, environmental, and so-
cial damages (including irreversible damages), and vulnerabilities of systems to per-
turbations  caused  by  either  natural  events  (dry  spells)  and/or  of  those  with  bad  in-
tensions (national security). These are critically important questions for the Nation,
and they are not being properly asked and framed, let alone addressed.

43

The  second  question  leads  to  a  set  of  studies  that  is  long  overdue.  We  have  fo-
cused  so  heavily  on  supplying  energy  and  water  in  unlimited  quantities  at  ‘‘low
prices’’ that we have failed to ask the basic questions regarding opportunities to do
more  with  less,  let  alone  limits  of  the  capacity  of  systems  and  the  implications  of
inefficient and unproductive use (waste) of critical resources.

My recommendation to this committee is that you follow these important hearings
with a process to formulate key questions and issues to be addressed by the unsur-
passed  research,  business,  and  public  policy  capacity  of  the  United  States  in  ad-
dressing  these  critical  challenges.  The  Committee  should  give  careful  consideration
to  designing,  framing,  and  setting  forth  key  questions  to  be  addressed  by  the  re-
search and development community (which I would take to include research institu-
tions, business, NGOs, and other interested stakeholders as well as key government
agencies) to meet the challenges of water and energy for the country.

A good example of an effective collaborative along these lines that involves a num-
ber  of  federal  agencies  as  well  as  the  research  community,  local  and  State  govern-
ment, NGOs, business, and others is the Sustainable Water Resources Roundtable.53
By focusing on the key questions, the Committee can provide both the leadership

and the guidance that is needed.

Conclusion: Opportunities for Integrated Water/Energy Policy Policy

Policy  frameworks  are  critical  to  achieving  success  based  on  advances  in  science
and  technology.  In  considering  alternative  policy  strategies,  decision-makers  should
carefully  analyze  and  consider  the  potential  multiple  benefits  available  from  inte-
grated strategies.

The  United  States,  like  other  nations,  faces  formidable  challenges  in  providing
water and energy to its citizens in the face of scarcity, rising costs, security threats,
climate  change,  and  much  else.  We  are  fortunate  to  have  the  scientific  and  techno-
logical  capacity,  and  the  institutions  of  governance,  to  take  on  these  difficult  chal-
lenges.  Policy  formulation,  starting  with  Congress  asking  penetrating  and  thought-
ful  questions,  is  a  critical  starting  point.  From  this  framework,  research  and  devel-
opment strategies can be developed to address society’s challenges in effective ways.
For  the  past  century,  the  focus  of  technological  innovation  in  water  systems  was
on the extraction, storage, and conveyance of water. Huge dams, aqueduct systems,
and  ‘‘appurtenant’’  facilities  were  designed,  financed,  and  built  to  accomplish  the
task.  Major  rivers  have  been  entirely  de-watered.  The  costs—economic,  environ-
mental, and social—are evident.

Integrated  water  and  energy  management  strategies,  with  a  focus  on  vastly  im-
proved  end-use  and  economic  efficiency  for  both,  and  careful  consideration  of  alter-
native technology opportunities provided by advances in science and technology, can
provide significant multiple benefits to society. Costeffective improvements in energy
and  water  productivity,  with  associated  economic  and  environmental  quality  bene-
fits, increased reliability and resilience of supply systems (all elements of the ‘‘mul-
tiple benefits’’), are attainable.

It  may  be  worth  quoting  the  California  Energy  Commission  from  its  Integrated
Energy  Policy  Report:  ‘‘Reducing  the  demand  for  energy  is  the  most  effective  way
to reduce energy costs and bolster California’s economy.’’ 54 Consistent with this ap-
proach,  improvements  in  efficiency  are  identified  by  the  California  Department  of
Water Resources as the largest (and in fact the most certain) new water supply for
the  next  quarter  century,  followed  by  groundwater  recharge  and  water  reuse.  The
state’s Energy Commission noted: ‘‘The 2005 Water Plan Update mirrors the state’s
adopted loading order for electricity resources.’’ 55

Methodologies  and  metrics  exist  to  tap  the  multiple  benefits  of  integrated  water/
energy  strategies,  though  they  can  and  need  to  be  improved.  The  policies  required
to incentivize, enable, and mandate integrated water and energy policy exist and are
being refined to tap ample opportunities to improve both the economic and environ-
mental performance of water and energy systems.

With  better  information  regarding  energy  implications  of  water  use,  and  water
implications  of  energy  use,  public  policy  combined  with  investment  and  manage-
ment strategies can dramatically improve productivity and efficiency. Potential ben-
efits include improved allocation of capital, avoided capital and operating costs, and
reduced  burdens  on  rate-payers  and  tax-payers.  Other  benefits,  including  restora-

tion and maintenance of environmental quality, can also be realized more cost-effec-
tively through policy coordination. Full benefits derived through water/energy strat-
egies have not been adequately quantified or factored into policy.

Public concern regarding environmental costs of diverting and extracting water is
another reason for the shift in technology focus from extraction to efficiency. Precipi-
tous  declines  in  populations  of  fish,  and  damage  to  ecosystems  around  the  world,
have driven this growing call for more sustainable water systems.

Current  technology  can  provide  water  supplies  through  efficiency  improvements
at  substantially  less  cost  than  the  development  of  new  supplies  in  most  areas.  As
water  prices  increase  to  reflect  full  capital,  operating,  and  environmental  costs,  it
is likely that technology will play an even greater role in providing water efficiency
improvements.

STATEMENT OF MR. MARC LEVINSON, ECONOMIST, U.S.

CORPORATE RESEARCH, J.P. MORGAN CHASE

Mr.  LEVINSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  quite  an  honor
for  me  to  be  with  such  a  distinguished  panel  today.  I  am  going  to
speak about water supply risks and their impact on investors.

First,  it  might  help  if  I  explain  exactly  where  I  fit  in  the  Wall
Street ecosystem. I specialize in economic issues, including environ-
mental  regulation,  and  my  clients  are  institutional  investors  who
buy  publicly-traded  stock  and  bonds.  I  say  that  to  make  clear  that
I  have  no  connection  whatsoever  to  our  mergers  and  acquisitions
business  or  to  the  lending  business  or  to  the  many  other  things
that an investment bank does.

In  my  opinion,  investors  are  much  less  concerned  about  water
supply  risks  than  they  should  be.  We  recently  published  a  report,
to which the Chairman alluded, contending that water-supply risks
are  far  more  important  to  many  companies  than  investors  believe.
We  also  found  that  very  few  companies  are  fully  aware  of  these
risks.

A  lot  of  companies  now  produce  PR  brochures  that  talk  about
how  they  are  reducing  water  use  per  unit  of  output,  but  almost
none of these companies thoroughly assesses what we call its water
footprint,  which  is  the  total  usage  of  water  in  its  supply  chain,
clear  through  to  the  consumption  of  its  products.  Investors  really
have  no  way  of  evaluating  the  risk  of  business  disruption  due  to
water scarcity or of comparing risks among companies.

We think these risks take three forms. One is physical risk. That
is the most obvious. This is the risk to which the Chairman alluded
earlier  that  occurred  with  the  Brown’s  Ferry  Reactor  last  year.  It

simply  had  to  be  shut  down  because  there  was  not  enough  water
in the Tennessee River to cool it adequately.

The  second  is  a  different  situation.  It  is  regulatory  risk.  Regu-
latory  risks  involve  government  decisions  to  allocate  and  price
water  in  response  to  scarcity.  Perhaps  the  best  U.S.  example  oc-
curred in 2001, when lack of water in the Columbia and Snake Riv-
ers  caused  the  Bonneville  Power  Administration  to  curtail  elec-
tricity sales to aluminum smelters in Montana, Oregon, and Wash-
ington.  In  the  short  run,  aluminum  production  plummeted  in  the
U.S.  In  the  long  run,  the  aluminum  industry  is  leaving  the  region
because regulators responded to water scarcity by raising the price
of a key input, electricity. In 2001, there were ten aluminum smelt-
ers in the Northwest. Today there are three still operating.

The  third  set  of  corporate  risks  is  reputational.  In  a  number  of
places  around  the  world  consumers  are  taking  environmental  con-
siderations  into  account  in  deciding  which  goods  and  services  to
buy, and we think companies that are perceived as bad actors face
a serious risk of consumer backlash.

The  risks  of  water  scarcity,  of  course,  are  not  evenly  spread
through  the  economy.  In  addition  to  semiconductors  and  power
generation,  water  sensitivity  is  particularly  acute  in  the  food  proc-
essing and in oil and gas production.

I  think  food  processing  risks  are  well  known  to  people,  perhaps
less  so  in  oil  and  gas  where  there  is  now  a  lot  of  interest  in  shale
formations.  Shale  rock  contains  very  small  pores.  Basically  the  oil
or gas cannot migrate to the well readily. The way this oil is recov-
ered  is  by  injecting  large  amounts  of  water  under  high  pressure,
a  technology  called  fracture  stimulation.  This  runs  afoul  of  a  lack
of water in many places, and so the lack of water is actually inhib-
iting the recovery of oil that would otherwise be available.

The  Committee  asked  me  what  the  Federal  Government  might
do  to  facilitate  the  equitable  and  efficient  allocation  of  water  sup-
plies, and I wanted to give you three thoughts here.

First,  if  you  look  at  overall  U.S.  water  consumption,  it  has  actu-
ally  been  fairly  flat,  but  there  are  some  disturbing  trends.  An  in-
creasing share of this consumption comes from groundwater, which
suggests that surface water resources have been tapped out.

Irrigation  accounts  for  about  two-thirds  of  U.S.  groundwater
withdrawals, and this share is probably growing. I would point out
that  the  effort  to  increase  production  of  ethanol  actually  increases
the  draw  on  groundwater  by  encouraging  the  planting  of  corn  and
other crops in fairly arid regions where it has to be irrigated.

There  are  more  than  100,000  irrigation  wells  in  the  United
States,  and  only  one-seventh  of  them,  according  to  the  Agriculture
Department,  only  one  in  seven  irrigation  wells  has  a  meter  on  it.
If  something  is  not  metered,  it  is  not  being  paid  for.  And  there  is
very little incentive to conserve something that you are getting for
free.

So I would suggest that here is an area for the Committee to look
at.  I  understand  that  State  law  rather  than  federal  law  governs
groundwater, but excessive use of groundwater clearly affects inter-
state commerce, and so there is a federal interest here. And in my
view  it  would  be  useful  for  Congress  to  encourage  the  states  to
apply  methods  of  pricing  groundwater  withdrawals  to  stimulate

92

conservation.  This  should  apply  not  just  to  agriculture  but  to  all
groundwater withdrawals.

A  second  subject  in  which  Congressional  involvement  might  be
useful  is  localized  water  treatment.  Almost  all  of  our  public  sup-
plies  are  now  treated  centrally.  As  a  result,  we  are  using  drinking
water  to  water  roses  and  wash  down  parking  lots.  This  represents
a  huge  waste  of  resources.  There  is  now  a  lot  of  work  going  on  in
developing  decentralized  water  treatments.  This  is  in  the  R&D
stage by many private companies. It might be an area in which fed-
eral  research  funds  or  changes  in  federal  water  treatment  regula-
tions would be helpful.

There  is  one  other  subject  I  want  to  touch  on,  and  this  is  power
generation.  I  know  there  is  a  lot  of  talk  on  Capitol  Hill  now  about
federal  loans  or  guarantee  programs  for  new-generation  nuclear
plans  and  for  coal  plants  with  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.
Both  of  these  technologies  require  large  amounts  of  water.  I  think
it  important  that  the  social  costs  of  these  large  water  withdrawals
be  reflected  in  the  prices  users  pay  for  the  electricity  from  these
plants.  It  is  just  bad  policy  for  the  government  to  be  subsidizing
water  usage,  and  this  applies  to  power  plants  as  much  as  to  agri-
culture and other industries.

Thank you very much.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Levinson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARC LEVINSON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  name  is  Marc  Levinson,  and  I’m  an  economist  at
JPMorgan Chase in New York. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today
about water-supply risks and their impact on investors.

First,  let  me  explain  just  where  I  fit  in  the  Wall  Street  ecosystem.  I  specialize
in  economic  issues,  including  environmental  regulation,  and  my  clients  are  institu-
tional  investors  who  buy  publicly  traded  stocks  and  bonds.  I  have  no  connection
whatsoever  to  our  loan  officers  or  to  our  investment  bankers.  My  perspective  is
strictly that of investors in public companies.

In  my  opinion,  investors  are  much  less  concerned  about  water  supply  risks  than
they  should  be.  We  recently  published  a  report  contending  that  water-supply  risks
are  far  more  important  to  many  companies  than  investors  believe.  We  also  found
that  very  few  companies  seem  fully  aware  of  these  risks.  While  many  companies
now  produce  public  relations  brochures  that  tell  how  they  are  reducing  water  use
per unit of production, almost none of these companies thoroughly assesses what we
call its water ‘‘footprint,’’ the total usage of water in the production and consumption
of  its  product.  Investors  have  no  way  of  evaluating  the  risk  of  business  disruption
due to water scarcity, or of comparing risks among companies.

We  think  these  risks  take  three  forms.  The  most  obvious  is  physical  risk,  which
means  an  actual  lack  of  water.  This  could  have  heavy  costs  for  an  industry  such
as  semiconductor  manufacturing,  which  needs  massive  quantities  of  clean  water.
Intel  Corporation  alone  uses  as  much  water  each  year  as  a  city  the  size  of  Roch-
ester,  New  York.  We  estimate  that  a  single  production  interruption  at  a  semicon-
ductor  plant  could  cost  $200  million  in  lost  revenue  and  badly  hurt  the  company’s
share  price.  The  customers  waiting  for  those  semiconductors  would  suffer  financial
losses as well.

Physical  risk  is  more  common  than  generally  realized.  In  2007,  for  example,  the
Tennessee Valley Authority was forced to shut a nuclear plant because there simply
wasn’t  enough  acceptable  cooling  water  in  the  Tennessee  River.  We  don’t  think  the
TVA is the only utility that will experience this problem.

The second set of risks that companies face is regulatory. Regulatory risks involve
government  decisions  to  allocate  and  price  water  in  response  to  scarcity.  Perhaps
the  best  US  example  occurred  in  2001,  when  lack  of  water  in  the  Columbia  and
Snake Rivers caused the Bonneville Power Administration to curtail electricity sales
to  aluminum  smelters  in  Montana,  Oregon,  and  Washington.  In  the  short  run,  US
aluminum production plummeted. In the long run, the aluminum industry is leaving
the region, because regulators responded to water scarcity by raising price of a key

93

input,  electricity.  In  2001,  there  were  10  aluminum  smelters  in  the  Northwest.
Today, there are only three.

The  third  set  of  corporate  risks  arising  from  water  shortage  is  reputational.  In
a number of places around the world, consumers are taking environmental consider-
ations into account in deciding which goods and services to buy. We think companies
that are perceived as ‘‘bad actors’’ by wasting water face a serious risk of consumer
backlash.

The  risks  of  water  scarcity  are  not  evenly  spread  through  the  economy.  In  addi-
tion to semiconductors and power generation, water sensitivity is particularly acute
in food processing and in oil and gas production.

The  food  processing  sector  requires  large  amounts  of  water  in  its  supply  chain,
principally  for  crop  production.  Getting  one  pound  of  beef  to  the  consumer’s  table
in  the  United  States  requires,  on  average,  about  2,200  gallons  of  water.  Higher
input  costs,  due  in  part  to  increased  competition  for  and  uncertainty  about  water
supply, already are hurting food manufacturers.

In the oil-and-gas sector, there is a lot of excitement now about shale formations.
Shales contain rock with very small pores, such that the oil and gas within the rock
cannot  readily  migrate  to  wells.  A  technology  called  fracture  stimulation  can  help
recover  these  resources—but  it  does  so  by  injecting  large  amounts  of  water  under
high  pressure.  Water  scarcity  is  already  limiting  the  development  of  energy  shales
in several parts of the country.

The Committee has asked me what the Federal Government might do to facilitate

the equitable and efficient allocation of water supplies. Here are a few thoughts.

If  you  look  at  the  aggregate  numbers,  U.S.  water  use  has  been  fairly  flat  since
the  1980s,  at  about  400  billion  gallons  per  year.  But  there  are  disturbing  trends.
An increasing share of those 400 billion gallons per year is groundwater rather than
surface  water.  Annual  groundwater  withdrawals  rose  14  percent  between  1985  and
2000,  while  surface  water  withdrawals  were  flat.  This  suggests  that  many  rivers
and  reservoirs  are  being  fully  utilized,  so  water  users  are  increasingly  relying  on
groundwater,  which  is  subject  to  less  regulation.  This  shift  will  probably  continue,
because  climate  change  is  expected  to  reduce  the  flow  of  surface  water,  especially
in the Southwest.

Irrigation accounts for about two thirds of U.S. groundwater withdrawals. Govern-
ment promotion of biofuels has led to large increases in corn plantings in some fair-
ly  arid  states,  especially  on  the  Great  Plains,  and  it’s  likely  that  a  lot  of  this  in-
creased acreage is irrigated. This means even more demands on groundwater.

There  more  than  100,000  irrigation  wells  in  the  U.S.,  and  only  one-seventh  of
them  have  meters.  An  unmetered  well  is  likely  to  be  a  well  that  a  farmer  can  use
without  paying  for  the  water.  Of  course,  there  is  little  incentive  to  conserve  some-
thing  that  is  free.  When  the  Department  of  Agriculture  asked  farmers  about  bar-
riers  to  reducing  energy  use  or  conserving  water,  the  most  common  response  was
that  conservation  would  not  save  enough  money  to  cover  its  own  costs.  The  second
most  common  response  was  that  conservation  measures  are  not  affordable.  Both  of
these  responses  are  ways  of  saying  that  water  is  so  cheap  that  it’s  not  worth  con-
serving.

I recognize that State law, rather than federal law, usually governs groundwater.
But  excessive  use  of  groundwater  clearly  affects  interstate  commerce,  so  there  is  a
federal  interest  here.  In  my  view,  it  would  be  useful  for  Congress  to  encourage  the
states  to  adopt  methods  of  pricing  groundwater  withdrawals  to  stimulate  conserva-
tion.  Pricing  should  apply  not  just  to  agriculture,  but  to  all  users  withdrawing
groundwater.

A second subject in which Congressional involvement might be useful is localized
water  treatment.  Almost  all  of  our  public  water  supplies  are  treated  in  centralized
treatment  plants.  As  a  result,  drinking  water  is  being  used  to  water  rose  bushes
and  wash  down  parking  lots.  This  represents  a  large  waste  of  resources.  It  might
be  more  cost  effective  to  treat  water  at  individual  buildings  rather  than  centrally,
so that only water needed for human consumption is treated. Several companies are
looking into technologies for decentralized water treatment, and this may be an area
in  which  federal  research  funds  or  changes  in  federal  water-treatment  regulations
would be helpful.

There  is  one  other  subject  I  want  to  touch  on,  and  that  is  power  generation.  I
know there is a great deal of talk on Capitol Hill about federal loans or loan guaran-
tees  for  new-generation  nuclear  plants  and  for  coal  plants  with  carbon  capture  and
sequestration.  Both  of  these  technologies  require  very  large  amounts  of  water.  I
think  it  is  important  that  the  social  cost  of  those  large  water  withdrawals  be  re-
flected in the prices users pay for electricity from those plants. It’s simply bad policy
for  the  government  to  be  subsidizing  water  usage,  and  that  applies  just  as  much
to power plants as to agriculture and other industries.

tainer  Made  the  World  Smaller  and  the  World  Economy  Bigger  (Princeton  Univer-
sity Press, 2006), which has received numerous awards.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Levinson, and Dr. Pulwarty,

Dr. Pulwarty, you are recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ROGER  S.  PULWARTY,  PHYSICAL  SCI-
ENTIST,  CLIMATE  PROGRAM  OFFICE;  DIRECTOR,  THE  NA-
TIONAL  INTEGRATED  DROUGHT  INFORMATION  SYSTEM
(NIDIS),  OFFICE  OF  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  RE-
SEARCH,  NATIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINIS-
TRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Dr. PULWARTY. Good morning, Chairman Gordon, Ranking Mem-
ber Hall, and the Members of the Committee. Thank you for invit-
ing me to speak with you today on the National Integrated Drought
Information  System  and  its  role  in  addressing  some  of  our  water
supply challenges in the 21st century.

My  name  is  Roger  Pulwarty.  I  am  a  climate  scientist  in  the  Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Director of
the  National  Integrated  Drought  Information  System  or  NIDIS
Program. I have also been fortunate to be a lead author on adapta-
tion in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth As-
sessment report and on the recently released IPCC technical report
on  climate  and  water  resources,  the  results  of  which  I  was  fortu-
nate to have presented before this committee last year.

As is widely acknowledged, drought is not a purely physical phe-
nomenon,  but  is  an  interplay  between  water  availability  and  the
needs  of  humans  and  the  environment.  Drought  is  slow  in  onset
and  its  effects,  such  as  impacts  on  energy  including  hydropower,
tourism, and commodity markets, can continue to be felt long after
an event is over.

As outlined in Public Law 109–430, NIDIS is envisioned to serve
as  an  early  warning  information  system  for  managing  drought-re-
lated risks in the 21st century. Impetus for information services to
support  federal,  State,  and  local  responses  has  risen  from  ongoing

along  with  declining  water  levels  in  the  three  largest  Great  Lakes
since the late 1980s.

A great deal of progress has been made since the NIDIS Program
was  established  in  December  2006.  A  national  interagency  and
interstate  program  implementation  team  has  been  developed,  the
web-based  drought  portal  was  launched  in  November  2007.  It  now
provides  comprehensive  national-level  information  on  ongoing
drought conditions and emerging conditions. NOAA and NIDIS are
accelerating  their  improvements  of  operational  climate  forecasts
and  information  on  past  droughts  tailored  to  watersheds  and  local
scales  such  as  the  upper  basin  of  the  Colorado  and  the  Southeast,
including Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and the Carolinas.
NIDIS  works  through  numerous  federal  agencies,  tribes,  states,
and  local  governments.  As  such,  there  is  significant  leveraging  of
existing  observing  system  infrastructure  and  products  such  as  the
drought  monitor  to  provide  improved  data  streams  at  the  level  of
detail  needed  for  decision-making  at  watersheds,  Colorado  basin,
and at regional scales such as the Southeast.

Data and predictions are by themselves insufficient to ensure ad-
aptation  and  flexibility  in  the  water  resources  sector.  A  hallmark,
no pun intended, of NIDIS is the provision of decision support tools
and training, coupled with the ability of users to report local condi-
tions  back  to  the  portal.  Near-term  activities  include  tailoring  of
the  drought  portal  to  add  locally-specific  data  and  information  at
the  watershed  and  county  levels.  Water  managers  are  already  ex-
plicitly  considering  how  to  incorporate  the  potential  effects  of  a
changing climate into specific designs.

For example, in the California Southern Metropolitan Water Dis-
trict and Seattle and Las Vegas, adaptive measures have been un-
dertaken.  But  the  barriers  to  implementing  adaptive  measures  in-
clude  the  inability  of  some  natural  systems  to  adapt  at  the  rate  of
combined  demographic  pressures  and  climate,  understanding  and
quantifying  our  water  demands  and  impediments  to  the  flow  of
timely and reliable information relevant for decision-making.

Climate services designed to support adaptation, of which NIDIS
is an example, will be important in coping with current and future
extremes  and  their  effects  on  water  resources,  regardless  of  how
that  change  is  derived.  As  part  of  their  drought  management,  mu-
nicipalities and State agencies will have improved climate informa-
tion  and  forecasts  at  key  entry  points  for  allocating  domestic  and
industrial water usage.

Water resource managers will have access to more detailed infor-
mation on low-flow conditions when balancing irrigation and hydro-
power with the needs of wildlife and flows to support coastal econo-
mies.  Emergency  declarations  can  now  better  reach  out  to  those
communities  in  need  of  assistance  with  improved  information  on
the aerial extent and severity of developing droughts.

So  while  per-capita  water  use  is  declining  in  some  parts  of  the
country,  trends  and  demand,  observational  records,  and  climate
projections  provide  abundant  evidence  that  our  fresh  water  re-
sources  are  vulnerable.  Priorities  for  drought  early  warning  infor-
mation  and  decision  support  tools  to  prepare  our  nation  for  these
challenges  requires  a  mixed  portfolio  of  approaches,  including:  en-
hancing the networks of systematic observations of key elements in

the  human,  ecological,  and  physical  systems,  including  monitoring
groundwater  and  vegetation  stress;  promoting  drought  plans  that
maintain State sovereignty but responds to the needs of shared wa-
tersheds,  including  developing  trans-boundary  monitoring  and
early-warning  information  for  our  internationally-shared  water-
sheds  with  our  neighbors  to  the  north  and  the  south;  developing
drought information impact assessment tools that include the costs
and  benefits  of  various  adaptations  and  changing  water  demands;
and  finally,  developing  usable  drought  management  triggers  for
specific  planning  thresholds  and  scenarios  in  agriculture,  water,
energy, and the coast.

The  challenges  of  managing  water  supplies  to  meet  social,  eco-
nomic,  and  environmental  needs  requires  matching  what  we  do
with what we actually know. NIDIS offers the Nation a mechanism
to  achieve  this  service  requirement  by  providing  a  basis  for  inte-
grating  drought  monitoring,  research,  and  information  for  decision
support.

Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  at  this  hearing  today,  and

I am happy to answer any questions you might have.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Pulwarty follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROGER S. PULWARTY

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  in-
viting me to speak with you today about the National Integrated Drought Informa-
tion System (NIDIS); the information/data currently available to local, State and re-
gional water decision-makers; and how we can improve the information available to
these decision-makers for adapting to current and future drought conditions.

My  name  is  Roger  Pulwarty;  I  am  a  Physical  Scientist  in  the  National  Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Climate Program Office and the Direc-
tor for the U.S. National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). I had the
honor  of  serving  as  a  lead  author  on  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change  (IPCC)  Working  Group  II,  in  Chapter  17,  Assessment  of  Adaptation  Prac-
tices, Options, Constraints and Capacity, and on the IPCC Special Report on Climate
Change  and  Water  Resources  released  this  past  April.  I  am  also  a  lead  author  of
the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), Synthesis and Assessment Report
on Weather and Climate Extremes in a Changing Climate and the Unified Synthesis
Report.  My  role  in  these  reports  focuses  on  impact  assessment  and  adaptation  re-
sponses.

In general, NOAA’s climate programs provide the Nation with services and infor-
mation  to  improve  management  of  climate  sensitive  sectors,  such  as  energy,  agri-
culture, water, and living marine resources, through observations, analyses and pre-
dictions, decision support tools, and sustained user interaction. Our services include
assessments  and  predictions  of  climate  change  and  variability  on  time  scales  rang-
ing  from  weeks  to  decades  for  a  variety  of  phenomena,  including  drought.  In  this
testimony  I  will  highlight:  (1)  present  drought-related  adaptation  measures  being
undertaken  in  the  water  sector  across  the  U.S.,  and  (2)  the  role  of  the  NIDIS  in
improving our capacity for responding to drought.

Drought  is  not  a  purely  physical  phenomenon,  but  is  an  interplay  between  water
availability  and  the  needs  of  humans  and  the  environment.  Drought  is  a  normal,
recurrent  feature  of  climate  and  while  its  features  vary  from  region  to  region,
drought  can  occur  almost  anywhere.  Because  droughts  can  have  profound  societal
and environmental impacts, there are several definitions of drought, each correct in
its  use.  These  definitions  include  meteorological  drought,  which  is  defined  by  the
magnitude  of  precipitation  departures  below  long-term  average  values  for  a  season
or longer; agricultural drought, which is defined as the soil moisture deficit that im-
pacts  crops,  pastures,  and  range  lands;  and  hydrological  drought,  which  is  defined
by  significant  impacts  on  water  supplies.  NOAA  provides  information  on  all  three
types of droughts in its U.S. drought information products.

Drought is a unique natural hazard. It is slow in onset, does not typically impact
infrastructure  directly,  and  its  secondary  effects,  such  as  impacts  on  tourism,  com-
modity markets, transportation, wildfires, insect epidemics, soil erosion, and hydro-
power,  are  frequently  larger  and  longer  lasting  than  the  primary  effects.  Primary

effects  include  water  shortages  and  crop,  livestock,  and  wildlife  losses.  Drought  is
estimated to result in average annual losses to all sectors of the economy of between
$6 to $8 billion (in 2002 dollars; Economic Statistics for NOAA, April 2006, 5th edi-
tion). The costliest U.S. drought of the past forty years occurred in 1988 and caused
more  than  $62  billion  (in  2002  dollars)  of  economic  losses  (Economic  Statistics  for
NOAA,  April  2006,  5th  edition).  Although  drought  has  not  threatened  the  overall
viability  of  U.S.  agriculture,  it  does  impose  costs  on  regional  and  local  agricultural
economies.  Severe  wild  fires  and  prolonged  fire  seasons  are  brought  on  by  drought
and  strong  winds.  These  fires,  similar  to  the  ones  in  California  this  past  year,  can
cause billions of dollars in additional damages and fire suppression costs.

Recent  IPCC  reports,  including  the  recent  Technical  Report  on  Climate  Change
and  Water  Resources,  highlight  emerging  needs  for  the  development  and  commu-
nication  of  climate  and  climate  impacts  information  to  inform  adaptation  and  miti-
gation  across  sectors  when  changes  are  beyond  average  climate  conditions  and  ex-
tremes. Drought risk management provides an important prototype for testing adap-
tation  strategies  across  the  full  spectrum  of  climate  time  scales.  Most  communities
(and  countries)  currently  manage  drought  through  reactive,  crisis-driven  ap-
proaches.  Experience  shows  that  effecting  change  in  managing  climate-related  risk
is  most  readily  accomplished  when:  (1)  a  focusing  event  (climatic,  legal,  or  social)
occurs  and  creates  widespread  public  awareness;  (2)  leadership  and  the  public  are
engaged;  and  (3)  a  basis  for  integrating  monitoring,  research,  and  management  is
established. The NIDIS offers the Nation a mechanism to achieve this latter service
requirement. The IPCC Fourth Assessment (2007) and the CCSP reports offer impe-
tus  for  integrating  knowledge  about  the  nature  of  societal  and  environmental  vul-
nerability,  attribution  of  the  relative  influences  of  climate  variability  and  change,
and  for  services  to  support  federal,  State  and  local  adaptive  responses  to  the  full
spectrum  of  climate.  This  impetus  is  further  strengthened  by  the  ongoing  debates
as  seen  occurring  in  connection  with  water  scarcity  in  the  West  since  1999  and  in
the  Southeast  since  2007,  along  with  declining  Great  Lake  water  levels  since  1986.
Given  that  a  drought  occurs  when  water  supply  is  insufficient  to  meet  water  de-
mand,  drought  impacts  are  evaluated  relative  to  the  demand  from  environmental,
economic,  agricultural,  and  cultural  uses.  The  impacts  of  past  droughts  have  been
difficult  to  estimate.  This  problem  results  from  the  nature  of  drought,  which  is  a
phenomenon with slow onset and demise that does not create readily-identified and
discrete  short-term  structural  impacts.  Drought  may  be  the  only  natural  hazard  in
which the secondary impacts can be greater than the more identifiable primary im-
pacts,  such  as  crop  damage.  Impacts  may  continue  to  be  felt  long  past  the  event
itself  as  secondary  effects  cascade  through  economies,  ecosystems,  and  livelihoods.
The  National  Integrated  Drought  Information  System  Act  of  2006  (NIDIS  Act;  15
U.S.C. § 313d and § 313d note) prescribes an approach for drought monitoring, fore-
casting, and early warning at watershed, State and county levels across the United
States.  Led  by  NOAA,  this  approach  is  being  developed  through  the  consolidation
of  physical/hydrological  and  socioeconomic  impacts  data,  engaging  those  affected  by
drought,  integration  of  observing  networks,  development  of  a  suite  of  drought  deci-
sion support and simulation tools, and the interactive delivery of standardized prod-
ucts through an Internet portal (www.drought.gov). NIDIS is envisioned to be a dy-
namic  and  accessible  drought  risk  information  system  that  provides  users  with  the
capacity  to  determine  the  potential  impacts  of  drought,  and  the  decision  support
tools needed to better prepare for and mitigate the effects of drought.

As  requested  in  the  2004  Western  Governors’  Association  Report,  Creating  a
Drought  Early  Warning  System  for  the  21st  Century:  The  National  Integrated
Drought Information System, NIDIS is being designed to serve as an early warning
system for drought and drought-related risks in the 21st century. With these guide-
lines  in  mind,  the  explicit  goal  of  NIDIS  is  to  enable  society  to  respond  to  periods
of  short-term  and  sustained  drought  through  improved  monitoring,  prediction,  risk
assessment, and communication.

Over  the  next  five  years,  NIDIS  will  build  on  the  successes  of  the  U.S.  Drought
Monitor,  Seasonal  Outlooks,  and  other  tools  and  products  provided  by  NOAA  and
other  agencies  to  effect  fuller  coordination  of  relevant  monitoring,  forecasting,  and
impact  assessment  efforts  at  national,  watershed  (e.g.,  the  Colorado  Basin),  states
(e.g.,  GA,  AL,  FL),  and  local  levels.  NIDIS  is  beginning  to  provide  a  better  under-
standing of how and why droughts affect society, the economy, and the environment,
and  is  improving  accessibility,  dissemination,  and  use  of  early  warning  information
for drought risk management. The goal is to close the gap between the information
that  is  available  and  the  information  that  is  needed  for  proactive  drought  risk  re-
duction.  Federal  monitoring  and  prediction  programs  that  feed  into  NIDIS  are  also
working with universities, private institutions, and other non-federal entities to pro-
vide information needed for effective drought preparedness and mitigation.

NIDIS will provide more comprehensive and timely drought information and fore-
casts for many users to help mitigate drought-related impacts. For example, hydro-
power authorities will benefit from enhanced water supply forecasts that aim to in-
corporate improvements in monitoring soil moisture, precipitation, and temperature
for  snowpack  conditions  into  forecasting  efforts  and  drought  information  for  water
management  decisions.  Municipalities  and  State  agencies  will  have  improved
drought  information,  based  on  present  conditions  and  past  events,  and  forecasts
when allocating both domestic and industrial water usage. Water resource managers
will  have  access  to  more  information  when  balancing  irrigation  water  rights  with
the  needs  of  wildlife.  Purchasing  decisions  by  ranchers  for  hay  and  other  feed  sup-
plies  will  be  enhanced  through  the  use  of  drought  information  to  identify  areas  of
greatest  demand  and  the  potential  for  shortages.  Changes  in  water  quantity  and
quality  due  to  climate  change  and  other  factors  are  expected  to  affect  food  produc-
tion and prices. Farmers will be better positioned to make decisions on which crops
to  plant  and  when  to  plant  them.  Since  drought  information  is  used  in  allocating
federal  emergency  drought  relief,  improvements  in  monitoring  networks  will  also
lead  to  more  accurate  assessments  of  drought  and,  as  a  result,  emergency  declara-
tion  decisions  that  better  reach  out  to  those  communities  in  need  of  assistance.  An
example  of  a  specific  improvement  in  monitoring  networks  is  the  addition  of  soil
moisture  sensors  to  the  climate  reference  network  by  NOAA/NIDIS.  The  identifica-
tion  of  gaps  in  monitoring  needed  for  early  warning  system  development,  primarily
within  snow  cover,  soil  moisture,  stream  gauge,  and  ground  water  networks  (in
partnership  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey),  will  be  identified  in  NIDIS  early
warning  pilot  programs  in  selected  locations.  Also,  in  partnership  with  Department
of  Agriculture  (USDA),  priorities  for  snow  cover/snow  telemetry  sites  will  be  up-
dated  as  need  arises.  Cross-agency  partnerships  to  fill  monitoring  gaps  will  be  de-
veloped with the interagency NIDIS Executive Council.

Data  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure  effective  adaptation.  A  hallmark  of  NIDIS
is the provision of decision support tools coupled with the ability for users to report
localized  conditions.  To  this  end,  NIDIS  will  link  multi-disciplinary  observations
from  a  number  of  sources  to  ‘on-the-ground’  conditions  that  will  yield  value-added
information  for  agricultural,  recreational,  water  management,  commercial,  and
other  sectors.  Multi-disciplinary  observations  include  land  surface  conditions  (e.g.,
for  fire/fuel  risk  and  soil  moisture),  streamflow  and  precipitation  observations,  cli-
mate  models,  and  sectoral  and  environmental  impacts  information  (to  identify  po-
tential high impact areas or sectors for different types of drought events). Also, im-
pacts  information  (i.e.,  how  drought  is  affecting  a  location,  how  similar/past
droughts  have  affected  the  location)  will  be  provided  by  NIDIS,  as  required  in  the
NIDIS  Act,  and  as  recommended  by  the  Western  Governors  Report,  and  decades  of
study  on  the  types  of  information  leads  to  effective  early  warning  triggers  for  re-
sponse.

The  first  step  towards  accomplishing  these  goals  was  to  produce  an  implementa-
tion plan. With the results of deliberate and broad-based input from workshops held
with  federal,  State,  and  local  agencies,  academic  researchers,  and  other  stake-
holders, the NIDIS implementation plan was produced and published in June 2007.
To  provide  guidance  on  system  implementation,  technical  working  groups  were
formed  to  focus  on  five  key  components  of  NIDIS.  These  components  are  public
awareness  and  education,  engaging  preparedness  communities,  integrated  moni-
toring and forecasting, interdisciplinary research and applications, and the develop-
ment of a national drought information portal.

A great deal of progress has been made since the NIDIS program was established
in December 2006. The U.S. Drought Portal, launched in November 2007 and hosted
on  the  NIDIS  website  (www.drought.gov),  is  operational  and  providing  comprehen-
sive  information  on  emerging  and  ongoing  droughts,  and  enhancing  the  Nation’s
drought  preparedness.  Other  Current  NIDIS  activities  include  conducting  the  first
national workshop to assess the status of drought early warning systems across the
United States, 17–19 June, Kansas City, MO. A NIDIS Southeast drought workshop
was recently held in Peachtree City, Georgia, 29–30 April 2008 to begin coordinating
drought  early  warning  information  systems  for  the  Southeast  region  especially  for
the  Appalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint  and  the  Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa  basins
encompassing the upper watersheds of Georgia to the coastal resources of Alabama
and Florida.

While  NOAA  is  the  lead  agency  for  NIDIS,  NOAA  works  with  numerous  federal
agencies,  emergency  managers  and  planners,  State  climatologists,  and  State  and
local governments, to obtain and use drought information. NOAA routinely dissemi-
nates drought forecast information via its National Weather Service (NWS) drought
statements,  and  collaborates  with  State  drought  committees  and  the  media  to  as-
sure  NOAA  information  is  correctly  understood  and  used.  NOAA  strives  to  provide

important 

an  end-to-end  seamless  suite  of  drought  forecasts,  regional  and  local  information,
and  interpretation  via  its  Climate  Prediction  Center,  six  Regional  Climate  Centers,
Regional  Integrated  Sciences  and  Assessments  (RISA)  including  the  Southeastern
Climate Consortium, local NWS field offices and State climatologists. Efforts are un-
derway  to  improve  drought  early  warning  systems  including  coordinating  inter-
agency drought monitoring, forecasting, and developing indicators and management
triggers for societal benefit. The other major federal agencies involved in NIDIS are
the Department of the Interior, USDA, the National Aeronautic and Space Adminis-
tration,  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  the  De-
partment  of  Transportation,  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  the  Environmental  Pro-
tection Agency, and the National Science Foundation. There is significant leveraging
of  existing  observing  system  infrastructure,  data,  and  products  produced  by  oper-
ating agencies, for example, stations of the NOAA National Weather Service Cooper-
ative  Observer  Program,  USDA  Natural  Resources  Conservation  Service  SNOTEL
(SNOpack  TELemetry)  network,  Soil  Climate  Analysis  Network,  National  Climate
Data  Center  Climate  Reference  Network,  and  the  United  States  Geological  Survey
streamflow  and  ground-water  networks,  as  well  as  the  USDA-Joint  Agricultural
Weather Facility and the USDA–Natural Resources Conservation Service/Water and
Climate  Center  Weekly  Report—Snowpack/Drought  Monitor  Update.  NIDIS  also
provides  a  framework  for  coordinating  the  research  agenda  among  these  agencies.
At  present  NOAA/NIDIS  is  supporting  the  development  of  new  drought  moni-
toring  and  prediction  products  and  accelerating  future  improvements  of  NOAA’s
operational climate forecast and application products through the use of competitive
grants,  and  through  the  tailoring  of  the  U.S.  Drought  Portal  to  add  locally  specific
data  and  information  at  the  level  of  watersheds  and  counties.  Questions  being  ad-
dressed  include  early  warnings  of  low  flow  conditions  on  the  Colorado,  on  drought
and  fire  risk,  agriculture  on  the  Southern  Great  Plains  and  the  reliability  of  water
supplies in the Southeast U.S.

Information  services  for  adaptation  on  short-term  (seasonal)  or  longer-term
(multi-year)  drought,  will  be 
in  coping  with  current  climate
vulnerabilities  and  early  impacts  in  the  near-term,  and  will  help  build  resilient
economies  as  our  climate  changes,  regardless  of  how  that  change  is  derived.  It  is
important  to  note  that  unmitigated  climate  change  could,  in  the  long-term,  exceed
the  capacity  of  some  natural,  managed  and  human  systems  to  adapt  especially  in
drought prone—heavily developing regions such as the Southwest. If climate change
results in increasing water scarcity relative to demands, future adaptations may in-
clude  technical  changes  that  improve  water  use  efficiency,  demand  management
(e.g.,  through  metering  and  pricing),  and  institutional  changes  that  improve  the
tradability  of  water  rights.  If  climate  change  affects  water  quality,  adaptive  strate-
gies  will  have  to  be  developed  to  protect  the  ensuing  human  uses,  ecosystems  and
aquatic  life  uses.  It  takes  time  to  fully  implement  such  changes,  so  they  are  likely
to  become  more  effective  as  time  passes.  The  availability  of  water  for  each  type  of
use may be affected or even limited by other competing uses of the resource.

Climate is one factor among many that produce changes in our environment. De-
mographic, socioeconomic and technological changes may play a more important role
in most time horizons and regions. As the number of people and attendant demands
upon  already  stressed  river  basins  and  groundwater  sources  increase,  even  small
changes in our climate, induced naturally or anthropogenically, can trigger large im-
pacts on water resources. Present hydrological conditions are not anticipated to con-
tinue into the future (the traditional assumption). It will be difficult to detect a clear
climate  change  effect  within  the  next  couple  of  decades,  even  if  there  is  an  under-
lying trend. Consequently, methods for adaptation in the face of these uncertainties
are  needed.  Early  warnings  of  changes  in  the  physical  system  and  of  thresholds  or
critical points that affect management priorities become important. Water managers
in some states are already considering explicitly how to incorporate the potential ef-
fects  of  climate  change  into  specific  designs  and  multi-stakeholder  settings.  Inte-
grated water resources and coastal zone management are based around the concepts
of flexibility and adaptability, using measures which can be easily altered or are ro-
bust  to  changing  conditions.  For  example,  in  California  and  Nevada  adaptive  man-
agement  measures  (including  water  conservation,  reclamation,  conjunctive  use  of
surface  and  groundwater,  and  desalination  of  brackish  water)  have  been  advocated
as means of pro-actively responding to climate change threats on water supply. Con-
sequently a complete analysis of the effects of climate change on human water uses
should consider cross-sector interactions, including the impacts of and opportunities
for changes in water use efficiency and intentional transfers of the use of water from
one sector to another. For example, voluntary water transfers (including short-term
water  leasing  and  permanent  sales  of  water  rights)  from  agricultural  to  urban  or
environmental  uses  are  becoming  increasingly  common  in  the  Western  United

States.  An  additional  major  challenge  in  the  coming  decades  will  be  maintaining
water  supplies  for  environmental  services,  which  support  tourism,  hunting,  fishing
and other recreational economies throughout the United States.

Adaptation  is  unavoidable  because  climate  is  always  varying  even  if  changes  in
variability are amplified or dampened by anthropogenic warming. Moreover, adapta-
tion  will  be  necessary  to  meet  the  challenge  of  demographic  pressures  and  climate
trends  which  we  are  already  experiencing.  There  are  significant  barriers  to  imple-
menting adaptation in complex settings. These barriers include both the inability of
natural  systems  to  adapt  at  the  rate  and  magnitude  of  demographic,  economic,  cli-
matic  and  other  changes,  as  well  as  technological,  financial,  cognitive,  behavioral,
social  and  cultural  constraints.  There  are  also  significant  knowledge  gaps  for  adap-
tation,  as  well  as  impediments  to  flows  of  knowledge  and  information  relevant  for
decision-makers.  In  addition,  the  scale  at  which  reliable  information  is  produced
(i.e.,  global)  does  not  always  match  with  what  is  needed  for  adaptation  decisions
(i.e.,  watershed  and  local).  New  planning  processes  are  attempting  to  overcome
these barriers at local, regional and national levels in both developing and developed
countries.

Adaptive capacity to manage climate changes can be increased by introducing ad-
aptation  measures  into  development  planning  and  operations  (sometimes  termed
‘mainstreaming’).  This  can  be  achieved  by  including  adaptation  measures  in  land-
use planning and infrastructure design, or by including measures to reduce vulner-
ability  in  existing  disaster  preparedness  programs  (such  as  introducing  drought
warning systems based on actual management needs).

Major  barriers  to  implementing  adaptive  management  measures  are  adaptation
itself is not yet a high priority, and that the validity of local manifestations of global
climate  change  remains  in  question.  Coping  with  the  uncertainties  associated  with
estimates of future climate change and the impacts on economic and environmental
resources  means  we  will  have  to  adopt  management  measures  that  are  robust
enough  to  apply  to  a  range  of  potential  scenarios,  some  as  yet  undefined.  Green-
house gas mitigation is not enough to reduce climatic risks, nor does identifying the
need  for  adaptations  translate  into  actions  that  reduce  vulnerability.  By  imple-
menting  mainstreaming  initiatives,  adaptation  to  demographic  and  climate  change
will  become  part  of,  or  will  be  consistent  with,  other  well-established  programs  to
increase  societal  resilience,  particularly  environmental  impacts  assessments,  adapt-
ive management and sustainable development.

Climate variability and change affect the function and operation of existing water
infrastructure—including  hydropower,  structural  flood  defenses,  drainage,  and  irri-
gation systems—as well as water management practices. Observational records and
climate projections provide abundant evidence that freshwater resources are vulner-
able  and  have  the  potential  to  be  strongly  impacted  by  climate  variability  and
change,  with  wide-ranging  consequences  on  human  societies  and  ecosystems.  Ob-
served  warming  over  several  decades  has  been  linked  to  changes  in  the  large-scale
hydrological cycle. Several gaps in knowledge exist in terms of observations and re-
search  required  to  better  understand  the  relationship  between  climate  change  and
water  issues.  Observational  data  and  data  access  are  prerequisites  for  adaptive
management, yet many gaps exist in observational networks. It is important to im-
prove understanding and modeling of changes in climate related to the hydrological
cycle at scales relevant to decision-making. Information about the water-related im-
pacts of climate change, including their socioeconomic dimensions, is incomplete, es-
pecially with respect to water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and groundwater.

Early warning information and decision support tools that are currently being de-

veloped to better prepare our nation, locally and regionally, for drought include:

• Enhancing  networks  of  systematic  observations  of  key  elements  of  physical,
biological,  managed  and  human  systems  affected  by  climate  variability  and
change  particularly  in  regions  where  such  networks  have  been  identified  as
insufficient;

• Strengthening and expanding water conservation and efficiency programs;
• Adopting  integrated  strategies  at  the  federal  level  (including  high  level  advi-
sory  councils)  and  support  a  framework  for  collaboration  between  research
and management;

• Promoting local watershed efforts;
• Improving groundwater monitoring and management strategies;
• Developing  usable  drought  management  triggers  for  planning  in  agriculture,
• Developing  economic  impacts  assessment  tools  including  the  costs  and  bene-

water, energy, health, environment, and coastal zones;

fits of various adaptations;

• Coordinating among drought monitoring and forecasting efforts at federal re-

101

gional, State, and local levels; and

• Actively  engaging  communities  and  states  in  monitoring,  preparedness,  and

planning.

The challenges of managing water supplies to meet social, economic, and environ-
mental needs requires matching what we know with what we do. NOAA and NIDIS
provide  mechanisms  for  the  Federal  Government  to  help  agencies,  states  and  local
communities  meet  their  economic,  cultural,  and  environmental  water  management
challenges in a timely and efficient manner.

Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  at  this  hearing  today  and  I  will  be  happy

to answer any questions the Members of the Committee may have.

DISCUSSION

EXPANDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S ROLE IN WATER

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Pulwarty.  At  this  point  we
will open our first round of questions. The Chair recognizes himself
for five minutes.

When  I  was  growing  up,  my  father  used  to  tell  me  about  how
really  his  life  and  life  on  our  farm  changed  when  the  rural  elec-
trification  came  out  there.  At  that  time  we  had  a  good  well.  That
is  how  we  got  our  water,  and  my  other  grandparents,  we  had  a
good  spring,  and  everybody  had  their  own  little  tin  can  down  at
the,  or  cup  rather  down  at  the  spring.  But  those  times  have  gone.
Even  if  you  have  a  spring  or  a  well,  they  probably  are  going  to  be
contaminated now.

And  so  particularly  in  rural  America,  and  when  I  saw  rural
America, I am not talking about way out farms like we were. I am
talking  about  even  small  little  subdivisions  right  outside  of  town,
oftentimes they don’t have water. And as we call it toting water is
something that many, many Americans are doing right now.

And  constantly  folks  are  telling  me,  well,  you  know,  the  water-
line is within a mile of our home, you know, but we can’t get it the
rest  of  the  way.  So  this  is  a  real  problem.  It  is  a  problem  as  you
pointed  out  with  the  nexus  of  water  and  energy  and  manufac-
turing.  Wars  have  been  fought  and  they  will  continue  to  be  fought
over water and probably more so in the future.

So  what  I  would  like  to  do  is,  using  your  cumulative  wisdom,  is
to get some suggestions on a federal role. You have already, if any,
and  you  have  given  us  some  of  those  ideas,  but  I  want  to  be  more
narrow in the sense that this committee really only has jurisdiction
over federal research and development, I think, in this area.

And  so  I  think  we  have  been,  done  a  pretty  good  job  of  trying
to  take  good  ideas  and  build  a  consensus  and  move  them  forward.
So what I would like for you to do, what I might say in the longer-
term, is to submit back to us any suggestions you might have that
this committee can do.

But  right  now  I  would  like  to  hear  you  cumulatively  talk  about
one,  two,  or  three  of  the  maybe  most  significant  things  that  this
committee  could  come  forward  with  in  terms  of  federal  R&D.  Mr.
Matheson  and  Mr.  Hall  already  have  a  bill  on  that,  and  we  would
like to see how that, you know, that role could be expanded.

So  I  will  open  the  floor  to  whoever  wants  to  start  off.  Anyone

want to start?

Dr. OVERPECK. Without any doubt research and development can
play a huge role in how we manage our water. I think what is real-
ly the biggest problem is what we don’t know. We don’t know what
water lies underground. We don’t really know how to predict what
kind  of  stream  flows  will  occur  in  the  future,  or  how  groundwater
infiltration  will  change  in  the  future  at  the  scales  that  are  impor-
tant for decision-makers, that is, at the scale of your farm or water-
shed.

We  don’t  know  how  climate  is  going  to  vary  in  the  future  with
enough  precision  to  be  able  to  forecast  it,  and  we  don’t  know  how
climate change is going to affect our water reserves.

So  all  of  these  things  require  more  research  and  development  to
get  the  clear  answers  so  that  we  develop  our  country  and  move
populations  around  and  grow  in  a  way  that  is  sensible  and  makes
sense with regards to our true future water supply.

And I think my colleagues will talk about also as we start to de-
velop  new  energy  economy,  that  has  to  take  into  account  water.
Water is far more valuable, I think, than many of our citizens real-
ize. We have to provide the underlying framework for making good
decisions, and I think much of that stems from research and devel-
opment.

I applaud the bill that your colleagues have put together. I think
it is very important to be looking at efficiency and conservation be-
cause  certainly  we  can  save  a  lot  of  water  that  way.  Thank  you.
Dr.  PARKER.  I  would  like  to  compliment  you  on  the  creation  of
this  H.R.  3957  bill  that  I  was  handed.  I  was  just  scanning  it  and
realized  that  it  covers  everything  from  water  pricing  for  conserva-
tion  and  water  reuse  for  efficiency  of  use  of  the  resource.  I  think
Dr.  Wilkinson  mentioned  water  reclamation  in  California  and  the
use of perhaps dual systems and the use of water of various quali-
ties for various purposes.

Now,  it  is  an  infrastructure  challenge,  but  I  think  we  better  be
heading  in  that  direction,  particularly  in  the  arid  West  where  I
think  the  availability  of  the  resource  probably  may,  is  becoming  a
limiting factor.

Chairman GORDON. Anyone else?
Dr. PARKER. I think it is a terrific bill.

Chairman GORDON. Well, Mr. Matheson, being from Utah, has a

103

firsthand interest and knowledge of that.

Dr.  WILKINSON.  Just  quickly,  I  think  there  is  some  obvious  op-
portunities in technology development for efficiency. We have come
a  long  way  just  in  the  last  decade  or  two  with  the  efficiency  of  a
lot  of  plumbing  fixtures  and  a  lot  of  other  opportunities  for  laser
leveling  of  fields  and  irrigation  technologies  and  the  rest.  So  I
think  there  is  a  long  way  to  go,  and  there  is  a  lot  of  opportunities
there.

The other is water efficiency of our energy systems. What can we
do  to  develop  energy  systems  that  require  less  water  or  no  water,
and  how  can  we  develop  portfolios  of  energy  systems  that  take
pressure off of our water systems. I think those two are important
areas.

Finally,  filtering  technology.  A  lot  of  our  water  now  with  con-
cerns  about  pharmaceuticals  and  the  rest  is  going  to  be  treated  to
greater  degrees,  and  looking  for  efficient  ways  to  use  water  and  to
filter  and  treat  it  in  ways  that  meet  the  health  standards  that  we
all  want  to  see  but  do  that  efficiency  I  think  is  going  to  be  very
important.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  will  try  to  abide  by  the  rules  here.  Does

anyone else have a real quick suggestion?

Mr.  LEVINSON.  Yes,  sir.  I  did  want  to  touch  on  the  point  that
water  availability  is  not  simply  an  engineering  issue  and  an  issue
of  R&D.  I  think  that  while  the  Committee  clearly  doesn’t  have  a
tax  jurisdiction,  the  Committee  can  do  a  great  deal  to  bring  into
public  discussion  the  point  that  water  is,  in  fact,  a  scarce  resource
and needs to be priced. Because, frankly, without pricing the possi-
bilities are quite limited.

Chairman  GORDON.  But  right  now  with  our  limited  time,  but  I
am  trying  to  be  more  specific  to  what  we  can  do  from  this  com-
mittee right now, getting suggestions.

Mr.  LEVINSON.  Yes.  I  think  that  to,  while  certainly  there  is  a
need  to  promote  conservation  technology  and  that  is  all  well  and
good,  you  really  also  have  a  bully  pulpit  here  to  use  in  order  to
make clear that this is a scarce resource. There does need to be ac-
tion on the pricing front if we are actually going to have conserva-
tion.

Chairman  GORDON.  We  are  going  to  have  a  variety  of  hearings,

and we hope to do that.

Dr. Pulwarty, did you have anything you want to add?
Dr. PULWARTY. One of the major issues is developing some of the
new technologies, not only for efficiency but for the transfer of tech-
nology into practice, and I think the bills make that case.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you.  There  will  be  a  point  where  we
are  going  to  have,  as  was  pointed  out,  a  megadrought  or  other
problem  that  will  bring  the  whole  Congress,  the  Presidency  all  to-
gether  for  a  water  program,  and  what  happens  oftentimes  is  that
is, you know, the cow is out of the barn.

So  what  I  hope  that  we  can  do  is  lay  a  foundation  with  R&D  so
that at that time we can really start to implement it. What I would
request  that  you  do  is  get  back  to  the  Committee  any  suggestions
in that area that you think, again, that there is either a legislative
role or a role for us to request different agencies to be involved. We

will then try to take those ideas and build a consensus and do some
good work here.

Ms. Johnson is recognized for five minutes. Oh, excuse me. I am

sorry. Mr. Hall is recognized for five minutes.

WATER INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY ABROAD

Mr. HALL. I would always yield to Ms. Johnson if she wanted me
to,  but  let  me  get  mine  behind  us  here,  and  thanks  for  that  peek
into  your  background,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  enjoyed  that.  No  telling
how good you could have done if you would have had more opportu-
nities as a young man.

One of the old references I have always heard and any time you
get  a  speech  as  long  as  15  or  20  minutes,  someone  always  refers
to water and fire as wonderful friends but fearful enemies. And we
have  sure  experienced  that  on  more  than  one  time  on  the  plains
of  Texas  and  in  the  drought  that  we  had  and  then  the  over-avail-
ability  of  water.  So  I  guess,  Dr.  Parker,  availability  is  important,
and it is also important to manage it.

So  I  would  ask  Dr.  Parker,  we  have  to  operate  on  information
and knowledge, and what, how would you compare the information
and  technology  available  to  water  managers  in  the  United  States
to  those  in  other  nations  that  face  similar  problems  to  what  we
face?

Dr. PARKER. I would say the short answer is I think we have got
better information. I think that there are nations such as Germany
that we might be lagging behind in terms of pushing innovative al-
ternative green technologies, that kind of thing, but in terms of hy-
drologic information, et cetera, I think we are a little better off.

Mr. HALL. Well, you very ably pointed out, I think, in your testi-
mony  that  when  you  discussed  water  quality  and  how  it  has  im-
proved  since  the  passage  of  several  federal  water  laws  or  water
acts.

What  else  can  we  do  to  ensure  the  quality  and  security  of  our
water  supply?  We  have  you  here  to  testify,  and  the  Chairman  and
others  here  will  take  your  testimony,  study  it,  and  everything  you
say  is  available  to  every  Member  of  Congress  because  of  the  court
reporter that is taking it down somewhere here that will report it.
What  else  can  we  do  to  ensure  the  quality  and  security  of  our

water supply? We can pass laws. What is the next step?

Dr. PARKER. I actually edited it out of my spoken testimony some
ideas  about  non-point  source  pollution,  which  is,  it  is  not  only  a
technical  and  a  management  issue,  but  it  is  also  a  legal  issue  in
the  sense  that  where  I  referred  to  some  of  our  laws  and  practices
as  becoming  obsolete.  There  is  a  prime  example  of  an  issue  that
isn’t dealt with very well within the legislation.

We  have  done  some  work  for  EPA.  Now,  this  isn’t  the,  probably
the appropriate thing for me to say, advising them on urban water
supply  system  security.  They  have  a  research  program  in  Cin-
cinnati. It is a very good one. It is under-funded. It ought to be well
supported. It was driven by concerns about deliberate acts of harm
to water supply systems. They are doing good work. It has brought
application  beyond  the  terrorism  context,  but  I  think  it  is  kind  of
a  hand-to-mouth  operation  that  each  year  has  to  fight  for  the  lim-

ited resources. It seems under-appreciated to me to the extent that
you have any influence over that.

Mr. HALL. I thank you.

BIOFUELS

Quickly, Dr. Pulwarty, one of the benefits of NIDIS that you de-
scribed  in  your  testimony  is  that  farmers  would  be  better  posi-
tioned to make decisions on which crops to plant and when to plant
them. Now, given the overwhelming incentives we passed last year
for  biofuels  and  the  reference  to  other  crops  that  they  ought  to
plant  and  those  that  planted  other  crops  including  corn  followed
the market and the increase in reception of the benefits of planting
that.  Have  you  seen  caution  or  hesitation  on  the  part  of  farmers
to plant fuel crops after seeing the information that NIDIS has pro-
vided?  Or  is  the  monetary  incentive  overwhelming  the  risk  of  the
natural environment?

Got an answer for that?
Dr. PULWARTY. The latter.
Mr. HALL. That is a good answer, and I think my time is up.
Chairman GORDON. You are a very good witness.
Now the gentlelady from Texas is recognized.

CLIMATE AND WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
To  the  panel,  I  chair  the  Subcommittee  of  Water  Resource  and
Development  on  transportation  infrastructure,  and  we  are  dealing
a great deal with supply. I am wondering what about the tempera-
ture change affects water supply, quality or quantity?

Dr.  OVERPECK.  Well,  temperature  change  certainly  has  a  major
effect  on  water  supply.  As  temperature  goes  up,  there  is  an  in-
crease,  and  it  is  not  a  linear  increase,  in  the  amount  of  moisture
that  the  atmosphere  can  hold.  So  the  atmosphere  will  demand
more  moisture,  and  where  will  it  get  that  moisture?  It  will  get  it
from  soil,  it  will  get  it  from  forests,  it  will  get  it  from  agricultural
plants.  It  will  get  them  from  reservoirs.  It  will  get  them  from  any
open source of water, and it will draw that water out.

So these temperature changes that are coming are huge, just gi-
gantic,  and  they  will  demand  a  lot  of  water,  and  they  will  make
the  droughts  of  the  past  look  pale,  because  it  will  be  so  much  hot-
ter.

Ms. JOHNSON. Yes.
Dr.  PULWARTY.  I  wanted  to  complement  Dr.  Overpeck’s  state-
ment.  One  of  the  impacts  on  temperatures  is  on  snowpack,  and
what we have seen not only in terms of early runoff, there has been
an impact on the actual quality, the amount of water that is in the
snow.  In  2005,  2006,  on  the  upper  Colorado  we  received  105  per-
cent  of  precipitation.  Because  of  the  dryness  before  that  and  be-
cause  of  the  warmth  of  that  spring,  105  percent  of  precipitation
was reduced to about 70 percent of the reliable stream flow.

We  have  been  seeing  that  in  different  years  based  on  tempera-

ture, evaporation, and sublimation, and vegetation stress.

WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION

Ms.  JOHNSON.  I  know  that  every  major  body  of  water  in  this
country  is  contaminated,  and  I  also  know  that  we  have  a  shortage
of  expertise  in  addressing  this  issue.  And  we  have  dealt  with  that
somewhat  in  this  committee,  because  we  know  there  is  such  a
shortage of science and math engineering students.

I am wondering how would you determine that we would address
many  of  the  problems  now  as  it  relates  to  the  research  here  with
such a shortage of people? Of qualified people?

Dr.  OVERPECK.  I  think  this  goes  back  to  Congressman  Hall’s
question  between  the  United  States  and  other  countries  of  the
world,  our  advantage  is  that  we  are  an  advanced  country.  That
means that we ought to be able to bring to bear much more knowl-
edge.  Knowledge  is  power.  But  it  is  not  just  knowledge,  power  for
our country, it is power for every individual that has to make deci-
sions in their day-to-day life about water.

And so we really need programs that educate everybody, not just
the  water  managers,  but  the  people  who  use  water,  because  so
many of the solutions will require cooperation of the citizens of the
United  States  and  that  we  work  together.  There  are  huge  discrep-
ancies between the per-person water use in cities in the West that
really  are  astounding,  and  we  need  to  learn  how  to  use  our  very
valuable water treasure more carefully.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much. I am doing a series of cable
shows  on  subjects  to  try  to  begin  to  educate  the  public,  and  one  of
the  major  questions  I  still  have  is  how  do  we  pay  for  all  of  this?
We  are  looking  at  creating  a  dedicated  fund  or  maybe  the
economist——

Mr.  LEVINSON.  If  I  may,  being  the  economist  in  the  room,  offer
two thoughts on this. One is that this all doesn’t have to be in the
public sector. There is in certain areas a lot of potential for private
investment  in  water  conservation,  if  it  pays  off.  And  I,  you  know,
hate to sound like a broken record, but to a certain extent you get
back into pricing here because that is what makes it interesting for
people to buy conservation equipment.

And to the extent that there is a demand for water conservation,
there  will  be  a  lot  of  private  initiative  in  developing  ways  to  con-
serve  water  and  process  technologies  in  particular  industries,  for
example,  or  improving  irrigation  or  that  sort  of  thing.  And  there
will  be  private  people  paying  for  this  R&D.  It  doesn’t  have  to  be
done by the government.

And  second,  to  the  extent  that  it  is  priced,  part  of  the  amount
that people pay for water can, in fact, be used for public sector re-
search and public sector infrastructure in this area.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Levinson.
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much.
Chairman GORDON. And Mr. Rohrabacher, you are recognized.

Mulholland  and  other  great  champions  of  California,  well  known
and  appreciated,  and  I  wonder  if  we  are,  our  generation  is  going
to have, create a better future as the Mulhollands did for us in the
past.

Dr.  Wilkinson,  let  me  just  ask  you,  and  I  did  really  appreciate
your  detailed  analysis  of  the  California  situation.  What,  this  year
and  the  last  couple  of  years,  have  we  had  trouble  with  snowfall  in
California?

Dr. WILKINSON. Yes, indeed.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  We  did?  We  do?  Okay.  Tell  me  about  it.  Do
we,  is  the  snowpack,  I  understand  the  snowpack  in  the  Sierra  Ne-
vada is actually higher this year than it was.

Dr.  WILKINSON.  Well,  we  have  considerable  variability.  We  had
good  snowpack  earlier  in  the  year.  For  the  last  two  months  we
have  had  very  little,  and  actually  it  started  quite  late.  I  took  my
graduate  students  up  to  Yosemite  in  December,  and  we  drove
across  the  pass.  Over  the  mountains  there  was  virtually  no  snow
at all in early December. Normally, of course——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. In December?
Dr.  WILKINSON.  In  December.  Normally  we  would  have  a  lot  of

snow.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right. Okay.
Dr. WILKINSON. But between early December then when it start-
ed  snowing  and  about  two  months  ago  we  got  a  pretty  good
snowpack.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  And  on  the  average  is  it  higher  this  year

than last year?

Dr. WILKINSON. It is a little bit——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Than years in the past?
Dr. WILKINSON.—below the average level but not a huge amount.
The problem is that with very little for the last two months, we are
now  facing  very  serious  water  situation.  Of  course,  you  probably
know  last  week  they  did  the  snow  survey  at  the  Summit  by  Echo
Lake, and they were walking on soil. There was virtually no snow.
So it is quite troubling.

Now, in terms of a water supply situation this year, we certainly
are  seeing  a  very  clear  signal  that  we  are  getting  a  shift  at  mid-
elevations from snow to rain because of warmer conditions. So that
pattern is already evident.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. I just note, Dr. Overpeck, that you did
mention  that  the  droughts  were  so  much  worse  in  the  past  than
we  are  experiencing  today,  and  while  I  certainly,  you  know,  I  am
clearly  one  who  disagrees  with  the  idea  that  we  have  man-made
climate change going on, but why is it, why are you convinced that
these  droughts  in  the  past  have,  which,  of  course,  obviously  had
nothing  to  do  with  human  activity,  why  are  you  so  convinced  that
today it is all a result of human activity even though the droughts
in the past were worse than they are today?

Dr. OVERPECK. Good question. In my testimony where I was able
to  expound  a  little  bit  longer,  I  tried  to  highlight  that  we  don’t
know the origin of the current droughts. We do know that they are
being made worse by the higher temperatures. That is causing the
rain on snow problem and the early melting of the snow that is giv-
ing  California  a  little  fit  this  year.  But  we  really  don’t  know  the

that.

origin  of  these  droughts  that  are  going  on  now,  and  that  is  why  I
tried to emphasize this idea of a no-regrets approach.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  I  would  suggest  that  we  also  don’t
know  the  cause  of  the  temperature  rise.  I  have  a  lot  of  sympathy
with people who say, ‘‘Look, this is what the climate is, and we got
to  prepare  for  it  because  there  will  be  droughts,  we  need  to  do
water,  et  cetera.’’  But  when  people  have  to  lace  their  testimony
with  a  reconfirmation  of  the  man-made  global  warming  theory,  it
doesn’t add to the validity here. It doesn’t. To me it seems, frankly,
it takes away from the presentation.

One  last  thing  here,  and  I  would  like  to  note  this,  and  Mr.
Levinson  mentioned  that  nuclear  energy  uses  water.  Have  you
looked  at  the  high-temperature  gas  cool  reactor  as  a  new  type  of
reactor, and does that use the same water?

Mr. LEVINSON. I am probably not the best one here to talk about

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Let me note, Mr. Chairman——
Mr. LEVINSON. Others may be more familiar.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—traditional  nuclear  power  plants  do  use
water, obviously, because they are based on steam. There is a, and
I  keep  pushing  this  because  I  want  people  to  take  a  look  at  this
alternative,  there  is  a  high-temperature  gas  cool  reactor.  My
friends  who  believe  in  global  warming  will  love  it  as  well,  I  might
add,  because  it  is,  of  course,  clean  and  does  not  produce  ‘‘green-
house gases,’’ but it does not use the water that the traditional nu-
clear power plants do.

And  I  would  suggest  it  is  something  we  should  look  at,  because
I  do  understand  there  is  a  direct  relationship  between  the  amount
of  energy  and  water,  and  Dr.  Wilkinson,  your  testimony  was  very
insightful in that. In fact, the desalinization now actually uses less
water than we use in pumping water throughout the State of Cali-
fornia,  and  I  think  that  is  a  significant  fact  that  we  need  to  take
into consideration.

Thank you very much to the whole panel.

POPULATION GROWTH AND WATER SUPPLY CONCERNS

Mr.  BAIRD.  [Presiding]  I  thank  the  gentleman.  I  will  fill  in  for,

as Chair until Mr. Gordon returns.

I will recognize myself for five minutes.
Do  we  have  a  sense  of  carrying  capacity  of  our  country  in  terms
of how big our population can get? You know, population is growing
rather  rapidly  right  now,  and  we  are  talking  about  already  seeing
shortfalls  of  water.  Any  thoughts  of  that  in  terms  of  what  the
tradeoffs would be? Do we have some numbers that say if our pop-
ulation grows by X, then we are going to have to reduce water con-
sumption by Y? Any thoughts about that?

Dr. Wilkinson.
Dr.  WILKINSON.  I  don’t  know  the  specific  answer  in  terms  of
what number we might accommodate. I can give you, though, some
breakdown.  In  California  we  use  about  80  percent  of  the  water  for
agriculture  and  about  20  percent  for  the  urban  system  for  people
directly. In much of the west it is even more for agriculture, on the
order of 90 percent. This varies, of course, tremendously around the
country  and  the  type  of  agriculture  and  so  forth.  In  California,  a

109

lot  of  the  discussion  revolves  around  transfers  of  water  from  agri-
culture to urban.

So  in  theory,  one  could  double  the  state’s  population  and  only
take  20  percent  of  the  water  currently  going  to  agriculture.  That
would  leave  another  60  percent  still.  That  is  in  theory.  I  am  not
sure  anybody  really  wants  twice  as  many  people  in  California  or
anywhere else. We have a lot of crowding already.

But  the  transfer  of  water  back  and  forth  becomes  in  terms  of  a
limiting factor and carrying capacity an interesting question. I will
say that Los Angeles has increased by one million people and held
water  use  level.  That  means  per  capita  use  has  gone  down  consid-
erably, and that is mainly through these efficiency programs, more
efficient plumbing fixtures and the rest.

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Levinson.
Mr. LEVINSON. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to mention there is
our recent report that was referred to earlier a very interesting pic-
ture  of  population  growth  and  water  consumption  in  southern  Ne-
vada. The story there is that the local water authorities simply im-
posed very draconian measures right at the start of this decade, ba-
sically  telling  people,  no,  they  couldn’t  plant  grass  anymore,  golf
courses  couldn’t  draw  public  water  supplies  anymore,  that  sort  of
thing.  They  experienced  quite  rapid  population  growth  during  the
past  seven  or  eight  years,  and  at  the  same  time  they  experienced
a fairly sharp decline in water consumption.

So  I  think  that  the  notion  that  there  is  a  necessary  correlation
between  population  growth  and  the  growth  of  water  consumption
isn’t right.

Mr. BAIRD. Dr. Pulwarty.
Dr.  PULWARTY.  To  complement  that,  there  has  been  changes  in
the efficiency of use. We know that it took 200 tons of water to cre-
ate a ton of steel years ago. Now it takes three to four. We are see-
ing lots of reductions in the per capita use of water. But that does
not  mean  that  demand  is  not  increasing  because  population  is  in-
creasing, even if we are leveling off in terms of per capita use.

One  of  the  things  we  do  have  to  keep  in  mind  when  we  talk
about  carrying  capacity  is  also  we  are  ingenious,  you  know.  One
hundred  years  ago  we  talked  about  some  of  these  issues,  and  we
did have a lot of adaptive strategies in place. Where we are seeing
the most immediate threats are in the environmental services pro-
vided  by  the  natural  environment  in  terms  of  recreation  and  tour-
ism and the sources of our water supply. That I think is where we
will bear the brunt of immediate pressure.

WATER QUALITY CONCERNS

Mr.  BAIRD.  We  had  a  rather  disturbing  report  here  in  the  D.C.
Metro  area  about  a  month  and  a  half  or  so  ago  about  contamina-
tion of the drinking water. Admittedly in parts of a trillion but re-
ports  of  anti-seizure  medications,  a  host  of  other  medications,  et
cetera.

Two  questions.  How  common  is  this  across  the  U.S.  water  sup-
ply,  and  what  technologies  exist  today  to  get  us  actually  pure
water?  If  somebody  has  twin  boys  at  home  and  any  parent  here
could  get  him  water  out  of  the  drinking  fountain,  and  you  say  to

yourself, so what meds am I giving my kids today with their glass
of water in their sippy cup? You would feel a little bad about that.
What  can  you  tell  us  about  what  we  can  do  to  purify  the  water

further and how common this problem is?

Dr.  OVERPECK.  Well,  I  don’t  think  we  have  any  experts  here  on
that  side  of  water,  but  I  certainly  share  your  concern  as  a  parent.
And  I  know  from  my  colleagues  at  the  University  of  Arizona  that
there  is  lots  we  can  do  in  terms  of  researching  out  what  is  in  our
water and how we then treat it to remove unwanted contaminants,
because  most  of  our  water  treatment  doesn’t  deal  with  that.  And
one  of  the  solutions  down  the  road,  which  my  colleagues  in  Cali-
fornia are already adopting is essentially toilet-to-tap. We are hav-
ing to use this water that has been used before, and we will do that
more and more into the future.

So  we  better  get  some  research  going  to  figure  this  out.  That  is

Mr.  BAIRD.  A  more  appetizing  terminology  might  help  advance

all I can say.

that effort.

OCEAN DESALINIZATION’S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

One  last  question.  We  read  in  some  of  your  testimony  about  de-
salinization.  What  are  the  adverse,  or  are  there  adverse  environ-
mental  impacts  to  desalinization  if  you  have  got  a  bunch  of,  you
know, are we changing the mineral makeup of the near-shore envi-
ronment?

And  any  thoughts  on  that?  I  am  particularly  thinking  about  as
we look at ocean acidification as a byproduct of climate change and
the  reduction  of  available  carbonate.  Does  desalinization  also  take
carbonate out of the, as a mineral, take it out of the system or——
Dr.  WILKINSON.  There  are  two  primary  concerns  about  environ-
mental  impacts  from  ocean  desalinization.  One  is  the  entrapment
and  entrainment  of  marine  organisms  on  the  intake  side  of  the
equation,  and  there  are  ways  to  remedy  that  by  drawing  in  the
water through the sand and beach wells and so forth. But there are
concerns about that.

And  then  on  the  flip,  as  you  mentioned,  is  discharge,  the  brine
discharge  back  to  the  ocean,  which  is  more  saline  than  what  was
taken out because we are taking some fresh water and then return-
ing  a  saltier  mix  back  in.  Some  of  the  solutions  to  that  proposed
are to mix that with effluent from waste water systems so actually
the  salinity  is  closer  to  the  ocean,  may  not  be  a  bad  solution.  But
both of those are challenges for ocean deals.

Mr. BAIRD. Thank you very much.
Mr. Smith.

WATER STORAGE

Mr.  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  to  the  panel

for your insight on the issues.

It is interesting. I come from rural Nebraska, where irrigation is
very important. It is actually helping feed the world I would argue.
Yet I only heard a little bit about surface storage.

Dr.  Wilkinson,  would  you  say  that  surface  storage  can  perhaps

help us mitigate climate change?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00114 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

111

Dr.  WILKINSON.  Surface  storage  clearly  plays  an  important  role
already  in  our  water  supply  systems  around  the  country.  One  of
the  concerns  with  surface  storage  is  with  increased  variability  in
the  system,  as  Dr.  Overpeck  described,  we  may  need,  where  we
have  surface  systems  that  are  providing  both  flood  control  as  well
as water supply, we may need to hold those systems at lower levels
to  provide  that  flood  control  or  take  further  risks  because  of  pat-
tern changes in precipitation.

So  that  becomes  problematic.  We  would  sacrifice  water  supply
and hydropower for those systems that provide those services if we
are  to  operate  those  systems  to  deal  with  increased  flood  control
risks.

The other issue with surface storage——
Mr. SMITH. Wait. If I could have clarification. I am sorry.
Dr. WILKINSON. Uh-huh.
Mr.  SMITH.  I  am  trying  to  follow  you.  You  are  saying  that  we

Dr.  WILKINSON.  We  will  have  to  leave  more  flood  control  space

need to draw down?

during the flood.

Mr. SMITH. Because of——
Dr.  WILKINSON.  Because  of  concerns  that  we  may  have  strong
precipitation  events  that  would  fill  them  up  quickly  and  then  spill
into  flood,  and  we  have  experienced  some  of  that.  We  have  had
some  problems  around  the  country,  and  so  one  of  the  concerns
when  you  have  less  certainty  as  to  what  might  happen  with  pre-
cipitation, but an increased chance that you may have high precipi-
tation events, then to maintain that flood control system you begin
to  lose,  there  is  a  tradeoff  there.  You  begin  to  lose  some  of  that
water storage.

The  other  big  issue,  of  course,  as  Jonathan  mentioned,  with  in-
creased  temperatures,  we  are  going  to  have  increased  evaporation,
and  that  is  actually  quite  a  serious  issue  with  surface  storage,  es-
pecially  in  arid  areas.  We  are  losing  a  lot  of  water.  Now,  that
doesn’t  mean  we  are  not  going  to  continue  to  use  surface  storage
systems,  but  we  may  need  to  recalibrate  our  rural  curves  and  our
expectations  of  water  supply  coming  out  of  them  based  on  climate
change.

Mr.  SMITH.  Can  you  give  any  numbers  for  what  you  think  the
difference  is  today?  It  is,  I  think  we  might  be  able  to  agree  that
climate  change  is  a  bit  of  a  moving  target  in  terms  of  defining  it.
We  are  even  getting  away  from  the  global  warming  terminology
and  going  to  climate  change  based  on  some  of  the  numbers  of  the
last 24 months or so.

Can  you  paint  a  picture  with  numbers,  easily  understood,  per-
haps,  of  where  we  are  with  surface  storage  today,  where  we  need
to be, compared to the past 100 years or so?

Dr.  WILKINSON.  I  can’t  give  you  a  specific  number,  we  need  X
amount  more.  Of  course,  it  depends  around  the  country  what  our
water supply situation is. Let me suggest two other considerations,
though,  in  addition  to  and  coupled  with  surface  storage,  and  that
is  groundwater  management.  We  have  tremendous  opportunities
right now around the country, certainly in California we have huge
opportunities  to  manage  groundwater  more  effectively  and  to  use
groundwater  storage.  Picture  it  as  an  empty  bucket  underground,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00115 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

112

storage  potential,  that  can  be  managed.  That  is  an  opportunity,  I
think,  we  pretty  much  all  agree  is  a  priority  for  water  manage-
ment. Of course, that means maintaining quality of what gets into
the  ground  and  once  it  is  in  the  ground,  maintaining  that  quality
so we don’t have the kinds of issues that were just mentioned, the
concerns about water quality and what is safe to drink.

Mr.  SMITH.  Now,  you  said  we  needed  X  amount  more  of  what?

I think you said something like we need X amount more.

Dr.  WILKINSON.  I  can’t  tell  you  exactly  how  much  more  surface
storage  the  country  would  need,  and  part  of  that  would  depend  on
how  well  we  use  groundwater  and  how  efficiently  we  use  water.
That would, in turn, reflect what our surface storage requirements
would be nationwide.

So  I  would  have  to  think  about  it  in  the  context  of  the  demand
side, how are we using water, the other options for storage, includ-
ing  groundwater,  and  then  what  we  need  to  do  with  our  surface
storage  systems.  I  would  suggest  we  would  need  to  consider  that
as a package in the integrated way.

Mr. SMITH. And would you suggest that we need more reservoirs?
Dr. WILKINSON. I think in some places we might and some places
there  is  serious  discussion  of  removing  reservoirs.  So  I  think  you
probably  have  everything  on  the  table.  Where  do  we  need  more?
Where do we have systems that may not be cost effective and may
need to come out.

Mr. SMITH. Very good. Very good.
Dr. Overpeck.
Dr. OVERPECK. Yeah. Thank you. I mean, I think what we really
are running up against here is we don’t have the knowledge to an-
swer  your  questions.  We  don’t  know  exactly  how  the  water  supply
from  the  atmosphere  will  change  in  the  future  and  how  the  de-
mand by the atmosphere in terms of evaporation will change in the
future.  We  need  to  nail  that  down  and  factor  that  into  our  models
of both above ground and below ground storage.

But  I  do  agree  with  Dr.  Wilkinson  that  below  ground  storage
might turn out to be a much more advantageous approach, particu-
larly  in  states  like  your  own  that  have  abundant  aquifers.  We  are
already  doing  this  in  Arizona  and  many  other  states,  such  as
Texas,  are  putting  the  water  underground.  And  you  don’t  always
get out what you put in, but nonetheless, you don’t have the prob-
lem  of  evaporation  or  some  of  the  other  problems  that  are  associ-
ated with above-ground storage.

And  one  of  the  ironies  of  climate  change  is  that  with  the  prob-
ability  of  increased  frequency  of  drought  comes  a  probability  of  in-
creased flood as well. This is because the hydrologic cycle of the at-
mosphere  is  getting  accelerated,  and  there  is  more  moisture  up
there,  more  energy,  and  it  gives  us  both  extremes  in  greater  fre-
quency.

And we are already seeing this around the world.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Smith. We are trying to beat
a vote here, and Ms. Richardson has been gracious enough to yield
to Mr. Matheson, who has another commitment, and you are recog-
nized for five minutes.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY’S ROLE

Mr.  MATHESON.  Thanks,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will  be  brief  and

maybe not use all five minutes.

You  had  a  discussion  with  the  Chairman  earlier  about  the  bill  I
introduced,  the  Water  Use  Efficiency  and  Conservation  Research
Act  of  2007.  As  you  probably  know,  it  would  establish  a  research,
development, and demonstration program within the EPA’s office of
research and development to promote efficiency in conservation.

I was curious what role that the people on the panel would envi-
sion  the  EPA  should  have  in  supporting  our  long-term  water  effi-
ciency and conservation effort policies in this country?

I don’t know who wants to answer. Anyone can answer.
Dr.  WILKINSON.  Let  me  just  start  out  briefly,  I  think  that  EPA
deserves a lot of credit for some very good work over the years. The
low-impact  development,  some  of  the  slides  I  was  showing,  storm
water capture and attenuation of pollution, for example. That they
are doing very good work on water use efficiency.

Of  course,  it  is  the  1992  Energy  Act  that  includes  the  require-
ments  for  efficiency  in  plumbing  fixtures,  and  that  has  made  a
huge difference. EPA has done a lot to follow up on that, so I think
they have already done a lot of good work. I think it is a very help-
ful move in what you have proposed here to take it a step further.
Dr.  PARKER.  I  see  EPA  as  a  very  visible  entity  throughout  the
water  supply  community.  I  see  them  as  advocates  as  various  ap-
proaches  to  water  supply  and  completion.  They  are  out  at  con-
ferences, they are in regulatory situations, they are in planning ac-
tivities.  There  is  only  so  much  that  they  can  do,  though,  to  advo-
cate without putting a little money on the table. And their research
budget has been cut back so severely in the last few years they are
losing their credibility.

I  think  you  have  nailed  it  with  this,  to  give  them  a  little  bit  of

money to push just what is needed.

Mr. MATHESON. I appreciate that, and I notice in your testimony
and  reports  from  your  organization,  Dr.  Parker,  you  make  a  num-
ber of recommendations for additional research.

Could  you  maybe  offer  just  your  opinion  about  what  you  think
are the highest priorities or the most critical areas where we ought
to  be  investing  in  R&D,  looking  out  over  the  next  20,  30  years  for
where we want to go? What do you think are the best priorities for
R&D on water conservation and water use?

Dr.  PARKER.  I  think  we  need  to  invest  more  in  dual  water  sys-
tems. I think we need to invest more in the institutional side of the
house.  It  is  severely  neglected.  Ms.  Johnson  from  Texas  was  talk-
ing  about  her  concern  about  human  resources,  and  I  interpreted
her  concern  as  being  professionals  in  the  field  but  then  the  con-
versation  took  sort  of  the  direction  of  public,  the  level  of  how  in-
formed the public is.

But the truth is is that in terms of having professionals available
to address problems and staff our agencies and our consulting com-
panies,  et  cetera,  is  really  in  sorry  shape.  The  dwindling  research
budget  for  graduate  students  in  universities  is  not  adequate  to
produce  the  people  that  we  need  in  our  field  just  when  the  prob-
lems are becoming most challenging. And the social science side of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00117 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

114

it has always been neglected. The water policy experts that I know
are all in their 60s. So we are losing the few that we have.

So  the  social  sciences,  innovative  supply  technologies,  conserva-
tion,  I  think  our  hydrologic  networks  are  probably  adequate,  but
they have been allowed to be eroded.
Mr. MATHESON. I appreciate that.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague letting me go.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  and  now  Mr.  Hall  is  recognized
for  a  quick  question,  and  then  we  are  going  to  finish  up  with  Ms.
Richardson.

CAN WE CAPTURE AND STORE RAIN WATER?

Mr.  HALL.  I  ask  the  question  of  Dr.  Pulwarty.  Something  that
has been bothering me for a long time, and you know, need spawns
breakthroughs  and  wars  bring  on  weaponry  like  the  Manhattan
Project  and  things  like  that.  And  shouldn’t  we  be  thinking  in  the
long-term thinking in the future of how to save water?

And  it  worries  me,  I  have  been  working  on  a  bill  trying  to  put
together  something  for  a  future,  a  study  for  the  future  of  working
on  a  bill,  maybe  even  a  sense  of  Congress  or  something  that  or
some  study  group,  when  a  bottle  of  water  gets  to  be  worth  more
than  a  good  bottle  of  beer  or  a  bottle  of  oil,  you  know,  we  got  to
go to thinking more about it.

And  I  see  in  Texas  and  west  Texas  the  rains  fall,  and  in  east
Texas rain is falling, and it goes on down to the sea. Shouldn’t we
be capturing that someday, even at 100,000 acres at a time to have
it?  And  we  don’t  have  that  need  yet,  and  it  is  too  expensive  now,
but  I  remember  when  it  was  too  expensive  to  have  a  module  for
astronauts  to  escape  a  shuttle  from.  And  we  shouldn’t  ever  think
anything  is  too  expensive  to  save  lives,  but  it  was  also  too  heavy.
Engineers  couldn’t  prove  it,  but  someday  is  there,  I  will  just  leave
this thought with you gentlemen.

Be  thinking  about  a  way  to,  giant  sumps  or  something,  to  cap-
ture that water and not let it run off to the sea and have it for the
time when we have the droughts.

Yes, sir.
Dr.  PULWARTY.  I  think  this  is  an  extremely  important  question
as  to  what  mix  and  types  of  storage  mechanisms  that  we  are,  in
fact,  talking  about,  and  at  the  same  time  have  enough  left  over  in
the system to make sure that the coastal economies that depend on
fresh water and flow for oyster beds, mussels, and other things like
that are themselves supported as a result.

One of the issues we have with withdrawing water for storage is
we  then  increase  saline  intrusion  from  salt  water  into  the  near-
shore  aquifers.  So  as  long  as  we  are  balancing  all  of  those  kinds
of issues, then I think, yes, storage is one of the options.

And we do have to think in terms of groundwater as well, simply
because if you can’t fill the reservoirs you have, extra storage does
not help us.

Mr. HALL. One day I think we will see a huge metal or otherwise
sumps under there, and at my age I don’t even buy green bananas,
so I can’t look that far. I can’t see that far ahead, but you younger
men, and this young Chairman here, I am going to get him to work

with  me  on  something  to  set  up  some  kind  of  a  study  like  that  so
we have a plan for 30 years from now.

And I will try to stay in Congress that long to see that they carry

it out.

Mr., I yield back my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  I  have  already  made
arrangements  for  Mr.  Hall  to  say  my  obituary  so,  Ms.  Richardson,
you are recognized.

MORE ON OCEAN DESALINIZATION’S ENVIRONMENTAL

IMPACTS

Ms. RICHARDSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Parker,  as  you  can  hear  from  Mr.  Hall  and  our  Chairman
here, you are in need of the next generation of water folks. As you
can  see,  we  have  got  great  folks  here  that  I  am  really  concerned
of the day when we won’t have Mr. Hall here to give us good analo-
gies.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  invite  you  and  or  maybe  one  of
the hearings we could have in the future would be about desalina-
tion.  The  largest  home  of  the  country’s  largest  and  most  advanced
federally-sponsored  seawater  desalination  research  and  develop-
ment  project  is  in  my  district.  Dr.  Wilkinson,  I  was  a  little  sur-
prised  with  your  comment  because  back  on  January  30,  2008,  the
Long  Beach  Water  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Interior,
Bureau of Reclamation constructed an under-ocean floor intake and
discharge demonstration system, which I happened to view because
it  is  right  there  at  the  Bluff  Park  where  I  walk  my  dogs  on  the
weekend. And the only other similar facility is in Japan, and I was
particularly, caught your comment because it was founded that es-
sentially  the  underwater  ocean  floor  intake  system,  the  ecological
impacts  of  entrainment  and  impingement  typically  associated  with
open  ocean  intakes  are  avoided  with  this  system,  which  is  what
when  you  were  asked  the  question.  And  this  natural  biological  fil-
tration  process  reduces  the  organic  and  suspended  solids  largely
eliminating  the  need  for  additional  pretreatment,  which  reduces
the overall energy footprint and cost of operation.

So I am not sure if you are familiar with the success of what we
recently  had.  The  project  was,  as  I  said,  recently  completed.  I
think,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  would  be  well  worth  either  one  of  us  tak-
ing a trip. We can take a Tennessee guy and have you have a real
good  time  in  California,  or  we  could  have  a  hearing  here.  I  think
there has been some very recent information.

And  Dr.  Wilkinson,  I  am  not  sure  if  you  are  familiar  with  those
results,  but  they  have  been  substantial  to  the  impacts  of  being
nearly  30  percent  more  energy  efficient  than  the  reverse  osmosis
technology system.

Dr.  WILKINSON.  I  think  you  are  exactly  right.  The  Long  Beach
project is quite good, and the Bureau of Reclamation has been help-
ing.

My  point  was  that  using  that  kind  of  an  intake  avoids  the  en-
trainment  and  impingement,  so  that  is  one  of  the  opportunities
where  the  geology  supports  it  to  use  that  kind  of  system.  I  think
that  is  a  success,  and  I  think  they  are  doing  some  very  good  work
in Long Beach.

Ms.  RICHARDSON.  So,  in  terms  of  funding  and  research  and
things  that  we  can  do,  I  think  it  is  a  valid  area  for  us  to  consider.
Chairman  GORDON.  I  certainly  agree.  I  just  talked  to  our  staff
and  she  said  that  we  need  to  be  sure  to  get  somebody  in  on  a  fu-
ture  hearing.  Her  response  was  that  we  have  been  talking  with
them extensively, and the term she used about what they are doing
was  ‘‘fascinating.’’  So  I  am  glad  that  is  coming  out  of  Long  Beach,
and we want to continue to learn more about it.

Ms. RICHARDSON. Thank you.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you.  We  are  maybe  eight  minutes
away from a vote, so let me thank our witnesses for appearing here
today.  Under  the  rules  of  the  Committee  the  record  will  be  held
open  for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements
and  additional  questions  that  they  might  have  of  the  witnesses.  I
ask  witnesses  if  you  will  respond  to  us  if  you  see  particular  areas
of federal R&D and also if you know a particular agency you think
where  that  should  be  carried  out.  Such  information  would  be  most
welcome, and it will be a part of our thought process.

And this hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:31 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Stephen D. Parker, Director, Water Science and Technology Board, Na-

tional Research Council

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Please  provide  the  Committee  with  recommendations  of  additional  Federal  re-

search and development to increase water supply and water use efficiency.

A1. See  Confronting  the  Nation’s  Water  Problems  (2004)1 by  a  committee  of  the
Water Science and Technology Board. This report was called for by a Congressional
mandate  and  would  seem  to  provide  a  very  complete  response  to  this  question.  See
in particular the executive summary and Table 3–1 for particulars.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In your testimony, you point out a number of issues that exist do to aging infra-
structure  and  outdated  water  management  systems.  If  you  were  to  prioritize
these  issues,  which  we  are  often  called  on  to  do  as  lawmakers  with  limited
funds, which of these issues would you address first? What viable solutions exist
that need to be adopted on a broad scale? Which area has been lacking research
that we now need to devote resources to?

A1. Personally,  I  believe  federal  leadership  through  EPA  programs  or  research
funding should give priority to (not necessarily in order):

• water reuse for potable and non-potable purposes, including use of dual water

supply systems;

• alternative, innovative, green urban stormwater and combined sewer overflow

system design and management; and

• water demand management approaches.

Q2. In  recent  years  we  have  been  exploring  a  number  of  new  energy  sources  to  try
to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  fossil  fuels;  however,  as  you  know,  a
number of these alternative energy sources require large amounts of water. How
do  those  changes  in  societal  preferences  affect  your  calculations  on  available
water resources?

A2. The  ‘‘water-energy’’  nexus  presents  many  challenges  to  those  concerned  with
water requirements for energy development and energy requirements for water sup-
ply. The WSTB has been unsuccessfully trying to develop a comprehensive study in
this area. We have few positions as an entity and my personal experience is limited.
My  only  recommendations  would  be  that  consideration  of  energy  alternatives  take
into  account  very  carefully  the  water  implications.  This  does  not  appear  to  have
been  the  case  in  the  crafting  of  biofuels  policy  as  indicated  in  a  2007  WSTB  report
Water Implications of Biofuels Production in the United States (summary attached).
Q3. In order to face the coming challenges in water availability and quality, we need
qualified  scientists  and  engineers.  Could  you  discuss  the  number  of  graduate
and  post-graduate  students  going  into  water  issues  versus  other  scientific  pur-
suits?  Is  this  enough  to  provide  critical  information  to  decision-makers  over  the
next few decades? What can be done to encourage greater interest in this subject?
A3. The  issue  you  identify  is  worrisome.  I  have  no  real  numbers,  as  perhaps  the
National  Science  Foundation  might,  but  it  appears  that  new  folks  are  not  entering
the water field and that our workforce is aging. It seems that restoration of respect-
able  funding  levels  for  water  resources  research  might  reverse  the  problem,  as  we
certainly  are  going  to  have  well  qualified  people  in  many  disciplines,  including  the
social  sciences,  to  help  address  the  increasingly  complex  problems  that  are  emerg-
ing. The attached Confronting the Nation’s Water Problems (2004) should help shed
some light.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Federal  drinking-water  quality  regulations  for  naturally  occurring  toxins,  such
as  arsenate,  can  be  burdensome  to  small  communities,  as  costs  of  remediation
are  very  high  and  far  beyond  the  budget  of  a  small  town.  Are  these  challenges
best addressed at the local, State, or national level, and what types of solutions
should be proposed?

A1. This  question  identifies  a  very  large  and  challenging  issue  that  affects  a  fifth
of  the  U.S.  population.  It  is  also  a  problem  being  addressed  by  EPA.  In  1997  the
WSTB  published  Safe  Water  from  Every  Tap:  Improving  Water  Service  to  Small
Communities,  a  report  that  provides  guides  on  relevant  technological,  financial,  in-
stitutional,  and  operational  issues.  The  report  is  attached  in  pdf;  I  personally  have
not  tracked  EPA  follow  through.  You  might  peruse  this  report  or  its  summary  and
then ask EPA for information and opinions.
Q2. What are your views on balancing the demand for various uses of water, includ-
ing,  drinking  water;  agricultural  uses;  energy  generation;  habitat,  especially  for
endangered species; and recreation?

A2. Conflicting  demands  are  presenting  themselves  in  many  regions  of  the  Nation,
and conflicts are not limited to arid areas. The ACF–ACT basins in GA–FL–AL pro-
vide  a  vivid  example  and  there  will  be  more  of  this  in  the  future.  Each  case  is
unique  and  it  is  hard  to  generalize,  but  in  my  opinion  decisions  must  be  informed
by  advanced  simulation/optimization  models,  with  visualization  capabilities,  to
produce  results  for  discussions  by  experts  in  all  relevant  disciplines  and  decision-
makers  along  with  all  stakeholders.  Not  everyone  is  going  to  get  everything  they
desire but consensus on outcomes can be achieved. It is unfortunate that the venues
for  such  decision-making  were  effectively  eliminated  with  the  demise  of  the  many
river  basins  in  the  early  1980s.  In  my  opinion,  such  river  basin  commissions  may
have been ahead of their time and should be resurrected.

Question submitted by Representative Russ Carnahan
Q1. Could  better  data  and  monitoring  improve  water  quality  and  quantity  for  St.

Louis and surrounding areas?

A1. Yes.  Such  data  would  be  necessary  but  insufficient.  The  attached  2008  WSTB
report  Mississippi  River  Water  Quality  and  the  Clean  Water  Act:  Progress,  Chal-
lenges,  and  Opportunities  discusses  this  and  describes  several  implementation  ac-
tions that should be pursued at the federal, State, and local levels.

Question submitted by Representative David Wu
Q1. It  is  important  that  states  and  local  communities  are  part  of  the  discussion  re-
garding  water  challenges.  However,  I  am  worried  that  some  stakeholders  may
have been overlooked. The United States has unique political relationships with
more  than  560  tribes.  Many  of  these  tribes  have  treaties  with  the  United  States
that recognize tribes continue to have certain rights; in some cases this includes
water. This is a very important topic we are discussing here today and all stake-
holders  should  have  a  voice  at  the  table.  Has  your  board  included  tribes  in  its
work? If not, why has this not been done? Will you include tribes in the future?
A1. Yes.  The  WSTB  has  engaged  tribes  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  in  its
work—both as committee members and as ‘‘resource people’’ to help inform our proc-
ess.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jonathan  Overpeck,  Director,  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Planet  Earth;

Professor, Geosciences and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Arizona

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Please  provide  the  Committee  with  recommendations  of  additional  federal  re-

search and development to increase water supply and water use efficiency.

A1. Several federal research and development efforts would contribute to increasing
water supply, and/or using our water supply more efficiently. These include:
1) A well-funded multi-year (I suspect at least 10 years would be needed) National
Water Supply Science and Assessment Program. This effort would undoubtedly
have  to  be  multi-agency  (e.g.,  NOAA,  NSF,  USGS,  NASA,  USDA),  and  ensure  at
least  50  percent  of  the  funds  were  targeted  at  the  extramural  research  community
(e.g.,  universities  and  private  firms)—to  ensure  maximum  peer-review,  regional
focus,  and  interdisciplinarity.  This  Program  could  be  part  of,  and  would  benefit
greatly from, a National Climate Service (see more below) that was explicitly di-
rected to include water supply in its mandate. Major foci should include:

1a)  documenting  the  size  and  quality  of  current  below-ground  water  resources
at the scale of one kilometer or less. This is currently not known for most parts
of  the  country,  and  would  require  drilling,  geophysics,  modeling  and  data  syn-
thesis.
1b) obtaining much improved estimates of likely future climate-related changes
in  water  availability,  in  terms  of  rainfall,  snow,  evaporation  run-off,  stream-
flow,  aquifer  recharge  and  other  metrics.  This  will  require  substantial  climate
research (e.g., to understand the dynamics of the North American monsoon and
tropical  storms),  climate  modeling  and  hydrological  modeling.  The  goal  should
be  to  make  substantial  improvements  on  the  climate  and  water  projections  in-
cluded  in  the  Fourth  Assessment  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change  (2007).  Close  partnership  between  the  scientific  research  community
and  regional  water-related  decision-makers  is  critical,  and  the  program  should
focus significant funding on the regional science and assessment often neglected
in federal R&D programs.
1c) a thorough investigation of how well the Nation’s current water storage sys-
tem  is  working,  and  how  it  can  be  augmented,  e.g.,  by  increased  above-ground
and  below-ground  storage.  This  investigation  should  factor  in  climate  change
(1b,  above),  as  well  as  possible  social  and  environmental  issues  that  are,  or
could  emerge  as,  problems.  Although  the  promise  of  further  above-ground  stor-
age  is  limited,  below-ground  storage  potential  has  not  been  thoroughly  evalu-
ated.
1d)  a  complete  interdisciplinary  (e.g.,  natural  science,  social  science,  economics
and law) examination of how water is currently used, and how greater efficiency
could  be  achieved.  Studies  of  this  type  have  occurred,  but  they  have  tended  to
be  small,  short-term,  and  not  interdisciplinary  enough  to  guide  effective  policy
at  both  national  and  regional  scales.  All  aspects  of  water  use  need  to  be  exam-
ined, understood, and optimized for maximum efficiency.

2)  An  improved  Integrated  National  Climate  and  Water  Monitoring  System
is  needed  to  track  water  supply,  water  quality  and  water  use  projections,  and  to
help  update  them  as  will  inevitably  be  needed.  The  system  should  be  designed  to
support water-use policy and to give stakeholders a comprehensive inventory of local
to  national  water  supplies  (below  and  above  ground)  at  any  given  point  in  time,
from  the  present  into  the  future.  Over  the  past  couple  decades,  streamflow  moni-
toring (gauging) has declined due to funding cuts just as water supply concerns have
become  more  acute.  The  same  holds  true  for  climate  monitoring  at  the  local  to  re-
gional  scales  needed  for  water  supply  prediction.  The  proposed  Integrated  National
Climate and Water Monitoring system should include monitoring of all underground
resources,  and  should  be  designed  to  support  the  proposed  (#1  above)  National
Water  Supply  Science  and  Assessment  Program  and  other  water  storage  programs.
3)  A  funded  National  Water  Oversight  Program  or  Commission  is  needed  to
ensure that all policy decisions made at local to national levels include scientifically
robust  assessments  of  their  possible  impact  on  water  supply.  For  example,  as  the
Nation explores alternative energy solutions, water requirements (savings or usage)

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00181 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

178

should  be  factored  in.  The  same  holds  true  for  public  lands  and  agricultural  policy.
Water supply is too important to be just an afterthought.
4) A national Water Education initiative is needed in order to make sure that our
citizens  understand  water  supply  issues  broadly  (e.g.,  including  climate  and  energy
issues)  and  are  prepared  to  work  together  to  ensure  the  Nation’s  water  supply  into
the future. Essential parts of this initiative should include K–12 education, informal
programs,  and  university  training,  and—especially  critical—the  next  generation  of
water  supply  scientists  and  engineers.  As  water  supplies  become  more  limited  due
to  population  increases,  aquifer  depletion,  and/or  climate  change,  the  need  for  this
expanded workforce will only increase.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. One of the things that has been stressed in recent National Academies of Science
reports is the need for more regional modeling and greater information resources
at  the  regional  level.  You  state  in  your  testimony  that  the  current  warming  has
led  to  a  decrease  in  spring  snow-pack.  Given  that  this  year  was  a  record  year
for  snowfall  in  the  Rockies,  what  is  your  confidence  level  regarding  the  fall  off
of spring snowpack attributable to climate change versus natural climate varia-
bility?

A1. I  strongly  concur  with  the  NAS-stated  need  for  great  focus  on  regional  climate
and  water  research,  observation,  modeling  and  assessment.  All  of  the  research  and
development  initiatives  that  I  advocate  in  this  document  need  to  have  greater  re-
gional  focus  than  is  the  norm  for  federal  programs.  The  reason  for  more  regional
focus is simply because most decisions, particularly with respect to water, are made
at  the  regional-scale.  Also,  our  scientific  understanding  of  physical  processes  (e.g.,
climatic  and  hydrologic)  at  the  regional  scale  lags  understanding  at  broader  scales.
This limits effective regional decision-making.

Both  natural  climate  variability  and  human-caused  climate  change  are,  and  will
increasingly  be,  water  supply  concerns,  particularly  in  the  U.S.  West  and  South-
west. Because there is substantial climate variability from year to year, and particu-
larly  with  respect  to  precipitation,  it  is  dangerous  to  read  much  into  what  happens
in any given year. The details of the most recent ‘‘water year’’ (starting in October,
2007) have not all been analyzed yet, but the trend over the last couple decades has
been  toward  an  increasingly  small  spring  snowpack  at  the  scale  of  the  U.S.  West.
This has recently been attributed in the peer-reviewed scientific literature to warm-
er temperatures, and also—in the same study—connected to a trend toward smaller
Colorado  River  flows.  Thus,  there  may  always  be  exceptions  in  any  given  year,  but
the longer-term trend is what we should be focused on and worried about.
Q2. In  your  written  statement,  you  include  a  figure  from  the  IPCC  that  illustrates
the  changes  in  runoff  projected  by  the  mid-21st  century  relative  to  the  average
run  off  from  1900–1970.  Isn’t  it  true  that  the  early  part  of  the  20th  century  is
recognized as being an unusually wet period and that rainfall and water supply
were  at  the  high  range  of  natural  variability?  Does  this  IPCC  figure  take  into
account  such  that  this  level  of  run  off  may  not  have  been  average,  but  in  fact
above average if looking over a longer period of time?

A2. Parts  of  the  20th  century  do  appear  to  have  been  wetter  than  the  long-term
(e.g.,  1000  year)  average  in  some  regions  (e.g.,  much  of  the  U.S.  West,  particularly
the  Southwest  and  region  of  the  Colorado  River).  The  figure  in  my  testimony  was
not  from  the  IPCC  4th  Assessment,  but  rather  was  from  the  more  recent  work  of
Milly et al., 2008 (reference included in my written testimony). They probably used
the  1900-1970  average  because  run-off  records  exist  for  this  period  across  the  U.S.
(and much of the globe), and because they considered the period to be representative
of  what  many  people  think  of  as  ‘‘average.’’  This  period  did  include  the  extremely
wet period of the 1920’s (when the Colorado water allocations were made), but also
the  drier  periods  of  the  1930’s  and  50’s.  In  their  work,  Milly  et  al.,  do  not  compare
projected future runoff with the longer-term average, perhaps because it is not pos-
sible to calculate the longer-term (multi-century) average for all of the U.S.
Q3. Dr. Overpeck, in your testimony you call for a national climate service designed
to support local and regional decision-makers in dealing with climate-related re-
ductions  in  water  supply.  How  would  such  a  service  differ  from  NIDIS  and  its
current  mission?  Would  you  envision  expanding  the  role  of  NIDIS  or  creating
another entity?

A3. Although  it  is  still  young,  NIDIS  should—in  addition  to  being  a  valuable  pro-
gram  in  the  face  of  drought—be  considered  an  excellent  ‘‘pilot’’  for  some  of  what  a

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00182 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

179

National Climate Service should be. NIDIS was designed to deal with drought, par-
ticularly  at  the  regional  scale  so  important  to  decision-making,  and  it  should  grow
and flourish in that capacity. The design of a National Climate Service should learn
from  NIDIS,  as  well  as  other  existing  programs,  but  it  should  be  a  new  program
with a broader mission.

Without  any  doubt,  a  National  Climate  Service  should  be  designed  to  be—first
and  foremost—responsive  to  the  needs  of  regional  decision-makers:  those  that  have
a true ‘‘stake’’ in climate variability and climate change. In this respect, a National
Climate  Service  should  be  designed  not  just  after  the  innovative  aspects  of  NIDIS,
but should also be heavily informed by the design and successes of the Regional In-
tegrated Sciences and Assessment (RISA) Program funded out of the NOAA Climate
Program  Office  (http://www.climate.noaa.gov/cpo¥pa/risa/); 
indeed,  much  of
NIDIS  was  informed  by  this  NOAA  RISA  program.  One  of  the  key  innovations  of
the RISA program is sustained partnership between regional science experts and re-
gional  decision-makers.  Another  innovation  is  that  the  RISA’s  enable  interagency
and  interdisciplinary  collaboration,  and—first  and  foremost—serve  to  be  constant
champions of regional climate and water science. The needs of regional stakeholders
should then drive a much larger integrated, multi-agency, National Climate Service
that  meets  those  needs  via  interdisciplinary  climate  system  (including  water!)  re-
search, observations, modeling and assessments.

Because NOAA is by far the strongest climate agency in the Federal Government,
they should lead the National Climate Service. However, the trickiest part, perhaps
other  than  funding,  will  be  to  devise  a  new  mechanism  to  ensure  that  (1)  multi-
agency partners truly work together, (2) use their funding within, and among agen-
cies  as  intended,  and  (3)  work—as  a  priority—to  meet  the  needs  of  the  regional
stakeholders.  Some  entity,  such  as  a  Commission  of  regional  scientists  and  stake-
holders, is needed that reports both to Congress and the White House, and that has
a responsibility to verify that funds are being used to—first and foremost—meet the
needs  of  the  regional  stakeholders.  Otherwise,  interagency  cooperation  and  coordi-
nation  will  not  be  optimal,  as  many  current  ‘‘interagency’’  programs  unfortunately
demonstrate.

One  of  the  primary  benefits  of  a  new  National  Climate  Service  would  be  to  pro-
vide  advantage  to  the  Nation,  and  its  regional  stakeholders,  in  adapting  to  climate
change  as  well  as  natural  climate  variability—including  drought.  I  am  currently
working  with  a  national  group  of  regional  climate  (i.e.,  RISA)  scientists  to  develop
a  more  comprehensive  plan  for  a  regionally  driven  National  Climate  Service,  and
I  will  forward  our  proposed  plan  to  you  and  your  committee  as  soon  as  we  have  a
complete document.
Q4. Dr.  Overpeck,  in  your  testimony  you  discuss  the  vulnerability  of  the  Southwest
to climate change related drought and you also point out the many times in the
past  the  Southwest  has  dealt  with  drought.  Given  the  susceptibility  of  this  re-
gion to drought, would you say it is more important to invest in research to pre-
dict  it  or  research  to  mitigate  the  effects  and  explore  other  ways  to  increase  po-
tential supply?

A4. The  Southwest  U.S.,  extending  from  California  into  Texas,  and  northward  into
the  central  Rockies,  is  going  be  increasingly  challenged  by  water  supply  problems
no  matter  what.  The  region  is  prone  to  more,  and  longer  droughts,  than  the  rest
of the Nation, and climate change is already making the situation worse with higher
temperatures,  less  spring  snowpack,  and  declining  river  flow.  It  is  safe  to  say,  that
the  situation  could  easily  get  worse,  but  it  is  also  safe  to  say  that  there  are  things
we can do about it.

We need to take both climate change (and drought) adaptation and mitigation se-
riously.  This  means  the  region,  hopefully  with  help  from  the  Nation  as  a  whole
(which  also  has  a  stake  in  climate  change  and  drought),  must  learn  to  use  water
more  wisely,  but  also  do  whatever  it  can  to  reduce  future  threats—namely  climate
change—to  water  supply.  In  my  response  to  Chairman  Gordon’s  question  above,  I
have outlined some important research and development initiatives that could help,
and  because  of  the  inevitable  climate  and  water  challenges  facing  the  Southwest,
I  am  a  strong  advocate  for  a  National  Climate  Service  (also  see  above).  For  these
same  reasons,  I  think  it  is  also  imperative  that  the  nations  of  the  globe—with  the
United  States  in  the  lead—start  working  aggressively  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions  to  80  percent  below  1990  levels  by  2050.  To  say  that  Southwesterners—
Arizonans and Texans alike—have a real stake in all these efforts is an understate-
ment.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Nebraska’s  panhandle  has  experienced  nearly  a  decade  of  severe  drought.  What
steps  or  technologies  are  needed  to  prepare  for  and  mitigate  long-term  drought?
A1. Clearly  Nebraska  has  a  major  stake  in  seeing  something  done  about  drought,
just  as  we  in  the  Southwest  do.  Fortunately,  what  I  have  outlined  above  summa-
rizes the national research and development efforts needed by Nebraska and neigh-
boring  states.  In  the  past,  I  have  researched  what  the  Dust  Bowl  drought  did  to
the  Nebraska  region,  and  I  learned  first-hand  that  the  record-hot—and  wilting—
temperatures of the 1930’s will seem cool in comparison with what will likely come
if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced dramatically and quickly. Nonetheless,
the  climate  change  already  in  the  pipeline  (due  to  inertia  in  the  climate  system)
AND  natural  drought  variability,  means  that  the  people  of  Nebraska  and  sur-
rounding states must also prepare for, and adapt to, likely future drought. My fore-
going responses should help understand what is needed.
Q2. What are your views on balancing the demand for various uses of water, includ-
ing,  drinking  water;  agricultural  uses;  energy  generation;  habitat,  especially  for
endangered species; and recreation?

A2. This is as much a values question as it is scientific. I value each of the entities
that  you  mention,  and  I  also  have  faith  that  our  country  can  figure  out  a  way—
using  knowledge  and  technological  innovation—to  keep  all  of  these  entities  healthy
and  in  the  balance.  However,  we  cannot  do  this  assuming  business  as  usual,  and
that  is  why  I  have  suggested  a  number  of  research  and  development  programs  in
my  foregoing  responses.  It  is  also  why  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  cutting  global
greenhouse  gas  emissions  to  at  least  80  percent  below  1990  levels  by  2050.  We  do
not want to sacrifice any of these fundamental—and valued—entities.

Your question raises one additional critical point: the role of water in energy pro-
duction. I note this in my above responses, but also would be a supporter of a mas-
sive (ca. $50–$100B/year) government effort to develop new and improved energy al-
ternatives that will speed the much needed greenhouse gas emission reductions that
are  needed  to  curb  climate  change,  as  well  as  to  make  our  country  truly  energy
independent and a global leader in energy technology sales. I bring this up here be-
cause  it  is  critical  that  we  factor  in  water  demand  as  we  develop  new  sources  of
energy: the climate-water-energy nexus is critical not just for Nebraska, but for our
entire nation.

Question from Representative David Wu
Q1. Western  communities,  specifically,  have  unique  circumstances  and  relationships
with  tribal  governments  as  it  relates  to  water.  Tribes  often  have  priority  water
rights  that  states  and  local  governments,  and  other  users,  must  account  for
when  creating  water  plans.  As  far  as  partnerships  go,  what  types  of  opportuni-
ties  exist  for  collaborative  efforts  that  recognize  tribal  water  rights  and  support
both non-tribal and tribal efforts?

A1. I  am  not  a  Native  Nations  water  rights  specialist,  but  I  live  in  state,  and  in
a  region,  blessed  with  many  Native  American  neighbors.  In  this  context,  I  have
worked  with  some  of  our  regional  Tribes  on  climate-related  issues.  In  my  foregoing
responses,  I  have  emphasized  the  need  to  drive  research  and  development—includ-
ing  a  National  Climate  Service—with  the  needs  of  regional  decision-makers.  In  the
Southwest,  and  across  the  U.S.,  the  Tribes  are  at  the  table  as  important  regional
stakeholders.  As  it  stands,  we  don’t  have  the  institutions  that  treat  climate  and
water  supply  issues  (including  energy—another  key  issue  in  Indian  Country)  holis-
tically, and that is what I am advocating in my foregoing responses. Any legislation
that comes to pass needs to be crafted to ensure the Tribes, and their members, are
fully invested partners in the activities that result.

On a slightly more personal side, I recently supervised a Navajo graduate student
who  just  received  her  Master’s  degree  after  completing  a  Four-Corners  climate  and
society  (agriculture  and  ranching)  thesis.  Her  focus  included  helping  leaders  and
kids on the Navajo Nation learn about climate issues. There is a clear need for more
such  graduate  students,  and  the  Federal  Government  could  help  with  funding  at
both  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  levels.  The  desire  is  often  there,  but  funding
and appropriate opportunities can be harder to find—especially for the interdiscipli-
nary  knowledge  creation  and  learning  that  is  needed.  Climate  and  water  partner-
ships would undoubtedly benefit from such increased funding for education.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Marc  Levinson,  Economist,  U.S.  Corporate  Research,  J.P.  Morgan

Chase

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Please  provide  the  Committee  with  recommendations  of  additional  Federal  re-

search and development to increase water supply and water use efficiency.

A1. The greatest urgency involves exploration of pricing schemes to encourage con-
servation.  Federal  R&D  money  would  be  well  spent  in  the  agricultural  area,  devel-
oping  crop  varieties  that  require  less  irrigation,  but  there  is  little  incentive  for  de-
veloping and planting such crops so long as most farmers are able to draw on water
for  free.  It  might  also  be  worth  considering  a  requirement  for  Congress  to  evaluate
water  impacts  when  considering  legislation;  such  a  requirement  might  have  been
useful  during  consideration  of  last  year’s  law  increasing  the  renewable  fuels  stand-
ard  and  this  year’s  farm  bill.  I  think  there  will  be  ample  private  funding  available
for  R&D  into  water-conservation  and  decentralized  water-treatment  technologies  if
these are economically viable, and no federal R&D effort is required.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. You mention in your testimony the concept of a water ‘‘footprint.’’ Could you pro-
vide  us  with  a  couple  of  examples  of  companies  that  are  aware  of  their  water
footprint and steps they may be taking to address their water footprint?

A1. We have examined a limited number of companies around the world and do not
claim  to  have  complete  information  on  this  subject.  Among  the  companies  we  have
examined,  only  Unilever  has  ever  reported  its  water  footprint.  Subsequent  to  the
publication  of  our  recent  report  on  this  subject,  other  food  and  beverage  companies
have  advised  us  that  they  intend  to  do  further  analysis  of  their  water  footprints.
In  general,  large  food  manufacturers  appear  to  recognize  that  they  can  achieve  the
largest  reductions  in  their  water  footprints  by  encouraging  greater  water  efficiency
among agricultural suppliers, and some are starting to examine this issue.
Q2. You  discuss  in  your  testimony  that  companies  face  regulatory  risks  in  the  form
of  allocation  and  price  controls  when  water  becomes  scarce.  In  your  work,  has
JPMorgan  Chase  found  any  regulatory  reform  options  that  might  address  such
problems  such  that  water  utilized  responsibly  while  business  can  remain  on
track?

A2. Yes,  we  have  seen  two  types  of  regulatory  reforms  that  are  important  in  this
way.  First,  there  are  a  number  of  jurisdictions  that  have  imposed  significant  cost
increases for water. Unfortunately, these increases often affect only customers draw-
ing  water  from  municipal  systems,  not  agricultural  and  industrial  users  that  draw
water  directly  from  rivers  or  groundwater  sources.  Better  pricing  schemes  are  ur-
gently needed. Second, some jurisdictions have imposed strong non-price regulations
that  limit  water  usage,  such  as  requiring  the  use  of  recycled  water  to  irrigate  golf
courses or barring the use of grass in landscaping in desert areas. We are not aware
of  jurisdictions  that  have  adopted  regulations  concerning  allocation  of  water  in  the
event of physical scarcity.
Q3. You  mention  nuclear  power  as  an  energy  source  that  utilizes  large  amounts  of
water  and  therefore  includes  a  ‘‘societal’’  cost  that  should  be  factored  into  the
price  users  pay  for  electricity  for  these  plants.  Should  the  same  hold  true  from
other sources of power, including renewables, such as biofuels and solar?

A3. Certainly. Water is a scarce resource, and its cost should be borne by those who
consume  it.  Biofuels  impose  very  heavy  water  demand,  particularly  by  encouraging
the  cultivation  of  corn  in  water-scarce  areas.  In  the  case  of  solar,  the  water-related
cost is likely to occur mainly in the manufacturing process rather than at the gener-
ating site.
Q4. In  your  testimony  you  touch  upon  the  impact  increased  biofuels  production  has
on  water  usage.  In  examining  the  development  of  the  biofuels  industry,  has
JPMorgan Chase performed an analysis of the water usage associated with feed-
stocks other than corn for biofuels production? Are there drought resistant plants
that could provide biofuels feedstock at lower ‘‘water’’ cost?

A4. We have not performed an analysis of the water usage associated with biofuels
feedstocks.  This  would  require  complex  modeling,  as  much  of  the  impact  is  likely

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00185 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

attributable to changed patterns of land use arising from higher crop prices. For ex-
ample,  ethanol  has  led  to  a  large  increase  in  cultivated  corn  acreage  in  the  Great
Plains  states;  whereas  corn  grown  for  ethanol  in  Ohio  might  not  require  extensive
irrigation,  corn  grown  for  ethanol  in  Nebraska  is  likely  to  require  heavy  irrigation.
The  intrusion  of  cultivation  into  former  conservation  reserve  areas,  another  con-
sequence  of  U.S.  biofuels  policy,  also  increases  water  demand  while  potentially  re-
ducing the recharge of aquifers. Switchgrass and sorghum are frequently mentioned
as  plants  with  lower  water  requirements  that  are  suitable  for  ethanol,  but  suitable
varieties  are  not  presently  commercially  available.  In  any  event,  their  impact  on
water  consumption  would  depend  upon  whether  they  supplant  corn  production  in
arid  locations,  or  whether  they  are  planted  in  even  more  arid  locations  and  serve
to increase the total amount of land under cultivation.
Q5. Please expand on your comments alluding to the fact that several companies are
looking  into  technologies  for  decentralized  water  treatment  and  that  federal
R&D  funds  may  be  helpful?  If  we  were  to  decentralize  water  treatment  for
human  consumption,  how  would  we  ensure  that  all  water  for  human  consump-
tion  met  baseline  standards?  What  regulatory  mechanisms  would  be  needed?
What  would  the  costs  associated  with  such  a  change  from  centralized  to  decen-
tralized water treatment be for a city like Washington, DC?

A5. I’m not sure the need here is for federal funding, as I hear anecdotally that con-
siderable  venture  capital  is  active  in  the  field  of  decentralized  water  treatment.  A
more important issue may be whether federal water-treatment regulations inadvert-
ently  favor  large-scale  municipal  plants  over  smaller-scale  treatment.  For  the  cost
reasons you indicate, it is probably not cost-effective to decentralize water treatment
in  an  area  where  centralized  treatment  is  already  in  use.  However,  it  may  well  be
sensible  to  consider  decentralized  treatment  for  new  housing  subdivisions,  large  of-
fice  complexes,  and  rural  areas  being  connected  to  piped  water  for  the  first  time.
Decentralized  treatment  effectively  requires  two  sets  of  supply  pipes,  one  for  puri-
fied water and the other for non-potable water, which would be connected to outdoor
spigots, cooling towers, and similar uses, but not to indoor plumbing.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Many  energy  generation  methods  require  water  to  produce  power.  Hydropower,
nuclear energy, petroleum refining, clean coal technologies, and biofuels produc-
tion all require large amounts of water. What steps should be taken in both the
public and private sectors to address water-use challenges as energy demand in-
creases?

A1. I think the big issue here is that subsidies encourage energy consumption with-
out regard to the social costs involved in producing the energy. It would be desirable
for Congress to pay more attention to the water impacts when crafting energy legis-
lation, and for energy produces to be forced to pay a reasonable price for the water
they  draw.  It  is  worth  considering  whether  closed-loop  recycling  systems  should  be
mandated  at  new  energy  facilities.  This  undoubtedly  would  raise  energy  costs,  but
is highly desirable from the viewpoint of water conservation.
Q2. If  new  hydropower  facilities  were  to  be  built  to  meet  the  growing  energy  needs
of  the  United  States,  what  would  be  the  main  water-use  challenges  that  would
need to be addressed?

A2. I  do  not  expect  extensive  construction  of  hydropower  facilities  in  the  U.S.,  due
both to environmental concerns and to the fact that many of the most suitable loca-
tions are already in use. My comment on this is that in the past we have mistakenly
relied  almost  entirely  on  supply-side  measures  to  meet  water  demand.  It  is  highly
desirable  to  provide  incentives  to  limit  demand,  and  pricing  is  the  best  mechanism
for this purpose.
Q3. Mr. Levinson, my home State of Nebraska has a large agricultural industry, and
irrigation  is  a  common  practice  in  much  of  my  district.  You  mentioned  in  your
testimony  that  groundwater  use  should  be  governed  by  federal,  rather  than
State, law. What federal legislation would you propose for the best allocation of
ground-  and  surface-water,  and  what  would  be  the  major  benefits  of  regulation
on a federal level, instead of a State level?

A3. My  testimony  was  not  that  the  Federal  Government  should  take  control  of
groundwater  use,  but  rather  that  the  Federal  Government  should  explore  methods
of  requiring  states  to  adopt  groundwater  pricing  schemes.  I  note  that  the  Federal
Government  uses  its  budgetary  powers  to  impose  many  such  obligations  on  states,

by threatening to withhold grants for particular programs unless State governments
take  specific  actions.  This  same  approach  could  be  used  to  force  states  to  adopt
schemes to price both groundwater and surface water. As a practical matter, I think
it would be extremely difficult for the Federal Government to make detailed alloca-
tion  and  pricing  decisions  at  a  great  remove  from  the  affected  communities,  so  I
think  it  is  wiser  to  leave  this  task  to  lower  levels  of  government  within  broad  pa-
rameters.
Q4. What are your views on balancing the demand for various uses of water, includ-
ing,  drinking  water;  agricultural  uses;  energy  generation;  habitat,  especially  for
endangered species; and recreation?

A4. I  have  no  particular  views  on  this  subject.  Insofar  as  the  subject  of  my  testi-
mony  is  concerned,  I  think  it  would  be  helpful  if  those  responsible  for  planning  for
water  scarcity  were  to  outline  in  advance  a  series  of  emergency  conservation  meas-
ures  in  priority  order,  so  that  individuals  and  companies  would  be  able  to  have  a
better  sense  of  the  likelihood  that  their  supplies  would  be  curtailed  in  the  event  of
severe supply shortfalls.

Questions submitted by Representative David Wu
Q1. How  do  we  ensure  that  rural  minority  communities  are  addressed  when  we
build out water infrastructure? Many of these areas have little to no existing in-
frastructure in place, and I’m afraid if they are not a part of our plans, we will
be  significantly  short-changing  a  large  population.  What  roles  can  corporations
play in this?

A1. Please see my response to Representative Hall’s question concerning decentral-
ized  treatment,  which  may  provide  a  more  cost-effective  alternative  for  rural  com-
munities  than  laying  supply  pipes  for  great  distances.  There  has  been  considerable
private  investment  in  water-distribution  systems,  but  whether  such  companies
would  find  it  attractive  to  invest  in  a  relatively  small-scale  distribution  system
would depend on the specifics.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Roger  S.  Pulwarty,  Physical  Scientist,  Climate  Program  Office;  Direc-
tor, The National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), Office of Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Research, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion, U.S. Department of Commerce

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Please  provide  the  Committee  with  recommendations  of  additional  Federal  re-

search and development to increase water supply and water use efficiency.

A1. Some  of  the  relevant  priorities  identified  by  the  National  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Council’s  Subcommittee  on  Water  Availability  and  Quality  are:  (1)  Quanti-
fying the future availability of freshwater in light of both withdrawal uses, and eco-
system uses; (2) Assessing and predicting the effectiveness of land use practices and
watershed  restoration  on  water  quality  and  ecosystem  health;  (3)  Developing  infor-
mation and efficiency tools to aid in water management including wastewater reuse
and  low-water-use  crops;  and  (4)  Improve  linkages  between  climate  and  hydrologic
prediction models and their applications.

To  address  these  priorities,  we  will  need  to  focus  on  improvements  in  the  ability
of  climate  models  to  recreate  the  recent  past  as  well  as  make  projections  under  a
variety  of  forcing  scenarios.  Research  should  focus  on  the  development  of  a  better
understanding of the physical processes that produce extremes and how these proc-
esses  change  with  climate  as  well  as  the  reconciliation  of  model  projections  of  in-
creasing  drought  severity,  frequency,  or  duration  for  different  regions  of  the  U.S.
The  creation  of  annually-resolved,  regional-scale  reconstructions  of  the  climate  for
the  past  2,000  years  would  help  improve  our  understanding  of  present  rates  of
change in the context of very long-term regional climate variability.

Development  of  improved  recharge  monitoring  techniques  and  social  science  re-
search on the severity of drought impacts and institutional responses (to understand
the  effects  of  human  activity  on  groundwater  recharge)  would  provide  information
needed to increase our water supply.

In  addition,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  response  of  the  biological  commu-
nity  to  changes  in  streamflow  and  stream  temperature,  clarity,  and  chemistry,
which are key issues in addressing instream flows and aquatic needs. It is also im-
portant  to  understand  the  degree  to  which  aquifer  storage  is  changing  and  will
change  in  the  future  (given  various  climate,  land  and  water  use  patterns),  in  addi-
tion  to  how  changes  in  groundwater  will  affect  streamflow  and  surface-water  flow
as a result of water management activities, land-use change, climate change, diver-
sions, and storage.

Adaptive  measures  include  both  demand  and  supply  side  approaches.  Demand-
side  measures  include  water  recycling,  reducing  irrigation  demand,  water  markets,
and economic incentives such as metering and pricing. Supply-side measures include
conjunctive surface-groundwater use, increases in storage capacity, and desalination
of sea water. Critical issues over the near term include: (1) ensuring adequate water
to maintain environmental services that support economic and cultural benefits; (2)
ensuring  development,  marketing,  and  adoption  of  efficient  technologies,  and  (3)
managing  information  needed  to  coordinate  data  collection  and  quality  control,
which will allow us to transform data and forecasts into accessible, credible, and us-
able  information  for  early  warning,  risk  reduction  and  adaptation  practices  in  the
water resources sector.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In  his  testimony,  Mr.  Levinson  mentioned  that  the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority
had to shut a nuclear plant since there was not enough cooling water in the Ten-
nessee River. What monitoring, prediction, risk assessment, and communication
tools  could  NIDIS  provide  for  existing  plants  to  avoid  such  a  circumstance?
Similarly,  what  monitoring,  prediction,  risk  assessment,  and  communication
tools  could  NIDIS  provide  so  that  states  and  companies  could  make  informed
decisions as to where to site a nuclear power plant, or any other type of electrical
power plant, in relation to water access?

A1. To  clarify,  and  for  the  record,  the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority  (TVA)  advises
that its Brown’s Ferry Nuclear Plant was not shut down because of a lack of cooling
water. The plant was derated because of a permitting agreement with the Alabama
Department  of  Environmental  Management  that  states  TVA  will  not  exceed  a  24-
hour downstream average temperature of more than 90 degrees.

Demand  for  energy  increases  demand  for  freshwater  supplies,  and  increased  de-
mand on water requires additional energy to store and transport water. Freshwater
withdrawals  for  energy  account  for  39  percent  of  total  withdrawals  in  the  United
States.  Transportation  of  water  to  produce  energy  introduces  additional  costs  in
plant  design.  Increases  in  water  temperature  in  streams  and  reservoirs  can  reduce
the  water’s  effectiveness  as  cooling  water  for  nuclear  plants  (as  occurred  at  the
Browns Ferry nuclear plant in Alabama in 2007).

As  part  of  its  forecast  of  precipitation,  NIDIS  communicates  forecasts  of  ambient
air temperature. This is useful because there is a close correlation between air and
stream  temperatures.  The  Department  of  the  Interior  (the  U.S.  Geological  Survey
and  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service)  and  others  can  use  NIDIS  information  to
provide  improved  information  regarding  potential  risks  of  high  temperature
instream events.

NIDIS  could  provide  valuable  information  used  to  make  more  informed  decisions
for  the  siting  of  nuclear  power  plants.  Plant  sitings  require  assessments  of  munic-
ipal and industrial demands and associated water supply reliability. NIDIS can pro-
vide information on past drought records for a particular location, water supply reli-
ability  for  projected  uses,  and  air  temperature-stream  temperature  relationships.
NIDIS  works  with  states,  communities,  and  agencies  to  enable  development  of  risk
assessment tools based on past events and forecasted droughts.
Q2. In your testimony, you discuss the need to develop adaptive measures to increase
the available water supply or use water more efficiently to address threats to the
water  supply.  I  have  introduced  legislation  that  would  encourage  research  into
treating  water  derived  from  underground  when  extracting  oil  and  gas  to  utilize
it  for  other  purposes.  Is  this  the  type  of  adaptive  measure  you  would  encourage
us to explore?

A2. NOAA does not have an established position on H.R. 2339, but as a researcher
on  adaptation  strategies,  my  answer  would  be:  Yes.  Sixty-five  percent  of  the  pro-
duced water generated in the U.S. (over one trillion gallons in 1993) is injected back
into the producing formation, 30 percent is injected into deep saline formations, and
five  percent  is  discharged  to  surface  waters.  The  produced  water  typically  contains
a  mix  of  contaminants,  including  high  saline  levels.  Standards  of  treatment  for
reuse  are  set  by  industry  technical  organizations  such  as  the  American  Petroleum
Institute (API) and the Oil Producers Association. The API has listed carbon absorp-
tion, air stripping, filtration, biological treatment, ultraviolet light, and chemical ox-
idation as potential treatments.

Standards  for  produced  water  disposal  are  determined  by  State,  national,  and

international regulatory bodies. Key questions to be addressed include:

(1) What  technologies  exist  to  treat  produced  water  to  disposal  or  re-injection

standards and what water quality standards must be met?

(2) How much would this cost?

Q3. Several  reports,  and  some  of  the  witnesses  who  testified  at  the  hearing,  have
called  for  the  creation  of  a  National  Climate  Service.  Would  NIDIS  be  a  good
platform to emulate for the collection, organization and dissemination of all cli-
mate  information  and  products?  Or  does  the  shear  volume  of  climate  informa-
tion  require  a  larger  or  more  complex  set  up?  Would  NIDIS  be  integrated  into
such a service, or would it stay a separate entity?

A3. The  NIDIS  structure  could  provide  guidance  for  the  development  of  a  National
Climate  Service.  NOAA  and  our  partner  agencies  are  still  in  the  process  of  devel-
oping an operational definition of ‘‘climate’’ services (i.e., examining how these serv-
ices  are  different  from  ‘‘weather’’  services)  and  completing  its  analysis  of  what  is
lacking  in  the  way  such  services  are  currently  delivered  throughout  the  Federal
Government. Any National Climate Service would likely focus on a broader class of
issues  and  information  users,  and  could  provide  an  umbrella  for  programs  such  as
NIDIS  by  developing  a  cross-agency  partnership  to  sustain  comprehensive  observa-
tions  and  monitoring  systems,  and  provide  for  state-of-the-art  research,  modeling,
predictions, and projections.

NIDIS  could  function  within  this  broader  system,  and  would  continue  to  inform
collaborative  coordination  and  planning  and  act  to  identify  innovations  in  drought
preparedness  for  transferability  to  other  parts  of  the  country.  NIDIS  is  in  essence
a decision support system; its main function is to develop, deliver, and communicate
drought  information,  forecasts  impacts,  information  for  preparedness  and  risk  re-
duction (or more generally valued climate services).
Q4. The  National  Science  and  Technology  Council’s  Subcommittee  on  Water  Avail-
ability and Quality, or SWAQ, released a report last year about science and tech-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:46 Sep 30, 2008 Jkt 042250 PO 00000 Frm 00189 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL08\051408\42250 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

nology requirements for water availability and quality. This report was a follow-
up to their 2004 report. In both papers, the Subcommittee strongly recommends
that  the  U.S.  develop  a  standardized  and  integrated  measuring  measures  and
create  an  account  of  its  water.  Although  they  suggest  that  some  agencies  have
been  involved  in  bringing  this  project  together,  would  NIDIS  be  an  appropriate
place for the dissemination of this type of data? Or should it be housed in a sis-
ter  program,  that  would  feed  information  into  and  receive  information  from
NIDIS, but be separate for separate management and decision-making purposes?
A4. NIDIS  should  not  be  tasked  with  the  full  collection  and  archiving  of  such  data
but as a recipient or client to help shape the collection by advising on priorities (e.g.,
key  areas  for  monitoring  improvements)  through  its  focus  on  drought  response  and
risk reduction; a separate program working with NIDIS would be most appropriate.
NIDIS  would  be  a  good  coordinator  for  integrated  information,  acting  as  a  clear-
inghouse for information that feeds into specific early warning and decision support
systems,  and  would  provide  a  catalyst  for  drought  mitigation  practice.  Data  on
water availability and quality would feed into NIDIS’ early warning design.
Q5. Would you give an example of what Federal, State and non-governmental moni-
toring  programs  feed  into  NIDIS?  How  much  do  these  monitoring  efforts  cost?
Are there gaps in the monitoring system? If so, where do they occur?

A5. Given  its  preliminary  status,  main  inputs  into  NIDIS  so  far  are  from  federal
agencies, such as NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey (e.g., Stream Gauge Network),
and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (e.g.,  Soil  Climate  Analysis  Network).  In
addition, recent efforts have begun to include water and reservoir levels in partner-
ship with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and states. In
June  2008,  NIDIS  convened  a  national  workshop  on  the  status  of  drought  early
warning  system  across  the  U.S.  States,  private  sector  (energy  water,  agriculture)
and  Tribal  representatives  at  the  conference  agreed  to  engage  with  NIDIS  on  data
provision  and  integration.  These  are  actively  being  pursued  for  inclusion  (with  ap-
propriate  data  standards)  into  the  U.S.  Drought  Portal,  and  are  important  for
supplementing and improving the U.S. Drought Monitor in locations with pilot early
warning systems in development.

The  original  recommendations  for  NIDIS  (in  the  2004  Western  Governors’  Asso-
ciation  report)  included  supporting  county-level  monitoring,  because  droughts  are
declared  at  the  county  level.  At  that  recommended  density,  there  are  still  gaps  in
our  monitoring  network.  NOAA  is  addressing  these  through  the  Historical  Climate
Network Modernization and the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) network.

The needs for improved monitoring are in groundwater quantity and quality, soil
moisture, high elevation snowpack runoff timing, and ecosystems. These characteris-
tics  are  important  in  modulating  streamflow.  Data  on  these  variables  are  not  yet
collected  using  standardized  approaches  at  similar  spatial  or  temporal  scales,  and
the  long-term  viability  of  the  data  collection  efforts  is  uncertain.  Recent  initiatives
such  as  the  National  Environmental  Status  and  Trends  Indicators  action  plan  and
pilot  activity  would  provide  guidance  on  assimilating  and  archiving  existing  data.
A comprehensive groundwater-level network may be needed to assess groundwater-
level changes, the data from which should be easily accessible in real time.

Soil  moisture  in  the  first  one  or  two  meters  below  the  ground  surface  regulates
land-surface  energy  and  moisture  exchanges  with  the  atmosphere,  and  plays  a  key
role  in  flood  and  drought  genesis  and  maintenance.  Soil  moisture  deficit  partially
regulates  plant  transpiration  and,  consequently,  constitutes  an  effective  diagnostic.
Active  and  passive  microwave  data  from  polar  orbiting  satellites  or  reconnaissance
airplanes  provide  some  estimates  of  surface  soil  moisture  with  continuous  spatial
coverage.  However,  these  approaches  are  limited  in  that  they  only  measure  soil
moisture  within  the  first  few  centimeters  of  the  soil  surface,  and  they  are  reliable
only when vegetation cover is sparse or absent. NIDIS recently (February 2008) con-
vened  a  small  workshop  to  assess  the  reliability  of  such  sensors  for  soil  moisture
measurements.

The  lack  of  long-term  soil  moisture  data  over  vast  areas  of  the  United  States  af-
fects  how  well  soil  moisture  is  incorporated  into  hydrologic  models  for  watersheds
or  large  regions.  NIDIS,  in  collaboration  with  the  National  Climatic  Data  Center
(and  with  USDA  Natural  Resources  Conservation  Service  (NRCS)’s  Soil  Climate
Analysis Network to complement their network), is in the process of deploying over
100  soil  moisture  sites  around  the  country.  Even  a  few  long-term  monitoring  net-
works  of  soil  moisture  would  substantially  decrease  the  uncertainty  in  predicting
processes  that  are  critically  dependent  on  soil  moisture  levels  (like  flow,  water
chemistry,  and  plant  response).  Similarly,  the  uncertainty  of  predictive  models  for
managing  water  supply  in  western  streams  reflects  the  density  of  stream  flow  and

rainfall  monitoring  networks,  because  the  amount  and  the  quality  of  data  in  areas
characterized  by  high  spatial  variability  in  precipitation  determine  the  reliability
and precision of such models. Inclusion of nonagricultural areas, along with a long-
term  commitment  for  high  quality  data  will  assist  water  resources  analysis  on  cli-
matic and regional scales.

The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  has  the  beginnings  of  a  ground-water  network  in  the
Ground  Water  Climate  Response  Network.  This  network  provides  ground-water
level  data  from  167  of  the  366  Climate  Divisions  in  the  United  States  and  Puerto
Rico. About half of the data in this network are accessible in real time.
Q6. Recognizing  that  this  is  a  fairly  new  effort,  how  successful  has  NIDIS  been  in
predicting  expected  drought  areas  thus  far?  What  resources  or  assistance  would
you need to improve your ability to make such predictions?

A6. Historically, skill in predicting drought has not been very high. However, there
are  climate  regimes  in  which  predictability  of  seasonal  drought  has  improved,  par-
ticularly  during  El  Nin˜ o  or  La  Nin˜ a  conditions.  NOAA’s  Climate  Prediction  Center
has  shown  demonstrable  skill  in  predicting  drought  at  seasonal  time  scales,  during
El Nin˜ o or La Nin˜ a events (and in particular during the winter). However, El Nin˜ o
and La Nin˜ a conditions are only active about half the time. Prediction of multi-sea-
son  and  multi-year  drought  has  not  been  successful.  NIDIS  has  been  successful  in
developing  a  nascent  system  for  monitoring  the  climate  and  identifying  potential
drought conditions as they evolve, but additional time will be required before we see
great improvement in drought prediction.

Predictions could be improved through increased focus on multi-season and multi-
year drought prediction capabilities, through focused research on drought prediction.
In the interim, some significant improvements in prediction are possible through im-
proved  monitoring  of  all  the  components  of  the  climate  system  related  to  drought.
These  components  include  estimates  of  rain  and  snow,  snowpack  depth  and  liquid
water equivalent, as well as estimates of the soil characteristics, ground water, and
vegetation.  Improved  monitoring  requires  better  integration  of  data  from  observa-
tion systems that already exist (computers to store, merge, analyze and provide the
data)  as  well  as  installation  of  additional  observation  equipments  (e.g.,  in  situ  in-
struments  and  satellite  sensors)  where  needed.  Monitoring  of  the  physical  climate
system must also be augmented by estimates of the demand for water resources im-
posed by agriculture, industry, and population shifts and growth. A ‘‘drought’’ is not
felt until available water is insufficient to meet specific needs.
Q7. Have  you  received  all  the  necessary  information  from  State  and  local  partners?

What about federal agencies? What barriers have you encountered?

A7. Agencies  and  states  have  been  very  responsive  by  providing  information  and
data sets to be linked to NIDIS activities.

As conceived in NIDIS, coordination includes:

• Establishment of a national research agenda,
• Efforts targeted at emerging problems, (e.g., as in the Southeast in 2007),
• Sustained attention on identifying monitoring and forecasting gaps, and
• A  competitive  grants  and  contracts  program  to  addresses  national  research

needs not addressed by specific agency missions.

Coordination can facilitate technology transfer from research organizations to user
communities.  However,  agencies  must  maintain  a  high  level  of  leadership,  account-
ability and autonomy.

In the next few years NIDIS will begin to tailor the Drought Portal for multi-state
watersheds.  This  will  provide  a  mechanism  for  more  fully  understanding  the  bar-
riers  to  integrating  State  and  local  partner  data  and  information  for  early  warning
information needs.
Q8. In an ideal world, how far into the future would your predictions need to be able

to reach to fully prepare or mitigate the effects of an impending drought?

A8. The  time  it  takes  to  fully  prepare  or  mitigate  the  effects  of  an  impending
drought  varies  depending  on  the  specific  problem(s)  being  addressed.  For  agri-
culture,  predictions  are  required  for  three  to  six  months  ahead  of  an  impending
drought event. However, the sustainability of economic activities and environmental
goals  requires  warnings  of  droughts  onset,  areal  extent,  and  potential  duration  (a
season,  a  year  or  a  decade  or  longer),  and  potential  impacts  on  each  of  these  time
scales. This is especially the case in regards to urban water needs in the west, forest
health,  low  flow  thresholds  for  meeting  interbasin  transfer  requirements,  energy
plant siting, and environmental flows.

Q9. How well known is the drought portal? Does the website collect statistics on hits
per  month  or  types  of  users  it  is  getting?  What  can  be  done  to  ensure  that  this
portal  becomes  a  well-known  information  source  with  farmers  and  local  water
managers as it is with universities and State governments?

A9. NIDIS  is  actively  engaging  all  of  its  partnering  agencies  to  help  educate  the
public  on  the  U.S.  Drought  Portal  (USDP).  Examples  include  the  U.S.  Department
of Agriculture, which has agricultural extension agents in nearly every county in the
Nation,  and  NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service,  which  has  local  weather  experts  in
135 offices around the country.

The  USDP  will  provide  education  and  outreach  materials,  publicly  available,
which  will  be  geared  toward  local  agency  representatives  engaging  constituents  at
the  local  level  and  touting  the  benefits  of  USDP  use.  In  addition,  representatives
of  NIDIS  are  participating  in  numerous  workshops,  forums,  and  meetings  around
the  country  in  order  to  communicate  what  is  available  on  the  USDP,  to  encourage
its  use  and  develop  its  role  in  proactive  drought  risk  management,  and  to  receive
feedback on its content.

The USDP keeps track of web hits for users entering the Portal. Currently USDP
receives 40,000 hits per month. Software is currently being developed to allow track-
ing  of  hits  to  web  pages  hosted  as  ‘‘portlets’’  within  the  USDP.  The  USDP  cannot
track its users by type at this time.
Q10. Have the droughts we have been experiencing strained our ability to meet inter-

national obligations regarding water resources?

A10. Please see the response to question 11 (below) for a combined response.
Q11. The  U.S.  shares  not  only  its  borders  with  Canada  and  Mexico,  but  it  also
shares  watersheds.  With  respect  to  this  geographical  reality,  how  has  U.S.
water  policy,  particularly  in  the  western  half  of  the  country,  affected  relations
with our neighbors?

A11. These  are  critical  concerns  and  have  been  broached  in  numerous  constituent
meetings  and  other  public  fora.  Canada  and  Mexico  are  actively  seeking  to  com-
plement  and  link  to  NIDIS  with  their  own  information,  since  droughts  cross  these
political boundaries.

The  U.S.  has  treaties  with  Mexico  over  both  the  Rio  Grande  River  and  the  Colo-
rado River. The Rio Grande agreement, resulting from a 1994 treaty, stipulates that
Mexico must allow a certain amount of water from the Rio Grande to reach the U.S.
In  return,  the  U.S.  must  provide  Mexico  with  1.5  million  acre  feet  a  year  from  the
Colorado  River.  These  commitments  have  not  entirely  been  met  on  either  side.
Drought  and  growing  economic  development  have  affected  the  ability  of  both  coun-
tries  to  meet  their  international  commitments.  Unfortunately,  the  treaty  provisions
for  allocating  shortages  during  a  drought,  and  in  fact  what  legally  constitutes  ‘‘ex-
ceptional  drought,’’  are  ambiguous  and  no  provisions  in  the  treaty  cover  the  possi-
bility of a climatic change that could alter the long-term availability of water in the
river. Research of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (Synthesis and Assess-
ment Report (SAP) 3.3, pp. 22–23; SAP 4.3, pp. 121–150) suggests that even modest
climatic  changes  might  have  serious  and  dramatic  impacts  on  the  Colorado  River
flow. Critical concerns include changes in: (1) water availability from altered precipi-
tation  patterns  or  higher  evaporative  losses  due  to  higher  temperatures;  (2)  the
seasonality  of  precipitation  and  runoff;  (3)  flooding  or  drought  frequencies;  and  (4)
the demand for and the supply of irrigation water for agriculture.

Changing  water  demands  in  the  United  States,  combined  with  climate  change,
could  seriously  compromise  hydroelectric  power  generation  and  other  uses  in  Can-
ada, especially in drier regions in southern areas of the Canadian part of the basin
(e.g.,  Okanagan  and  Osoyoos  lakes).  There  are  several  (at  least  12)  large  bilateral
drainage  basins,  or  groups  of  small  basins,  for  which  the  International  Joint  Com-
mission  has  responsibility  under  the  Boundary  Waters  Treaty  of  1909.  Many  of
these  basins,  and  their  sub-basins,  have  water-sharing  agreements  where  rivers
flow north or south across the border. In some basins, pollution control agreements
are also in place to protect ecosystems and water quality (e.g., Great Lakes–St. Law-
rence River). Climate affects both the quantity and quality of these waters, and the
ability of one country to meet its present obligations to the other.

Thirty  to  thirty-five  percent  of  the  water  in  the  Columbia  River  basin  originates
in Canada yet only 15 percent of the basin lies in Canada. On the Columbia River,
the  predicted  trend  towards  greater  flow  in  winter  and  less  flow  in  spring  is  ex-
pected to continue affecting salmon migration as well as hydropower.

Increased  evaporation  (especially  during  winter)  is  expected  due  to  warmer  tem-
peratures, which would lower Great Lakes water levels and reduce the flow of rivers

in the system, including the St. Lawrence. In the scenario described above, adverse
impacts  on  shipping,  hydroelectric  power  generation,  and  water  quality  are  pro-
jected.  A  recent  amendment  to  the  International  Boundary  Waters  Treaty  Act  by
Canada prohibits bulk-water removals and diversions from border and trans-border
waters but does not deal with attempts to divert internal Canadian waters, an issue
that a number of provinces have similarly addressed. There is also a risk that these
disagreements  will  spill  over  into  economic  policy,  trade  agreements,  and  security
arrangements.

International  obligations  have  been  met,  but  not  without  contention  during
drought situations. However, given trends in the Great Lakes, the Colorado, the Rio
Grande and the Columbia Rivers, further strains are foreseeable in the near future
and will be exacerbated during conditions of exceptional drought.

Questions submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. Nebraska’s  panhandle  has  experienced  nearly  a  decade  of  severe  drought.  What
steps  or  technologies  are  needed  to  prepare  for  and  mitigate  long-term  drought?
A1. Mitigation  options  will  be  different  for  agricultural  producers,  municipal  water
suppliers,  city  and  county  land  use  planners,  environmental  interests,  and  State
agencies, but ideally, all should be working in coordination. NIDIS works very close-
ly  with  the  National  Drought  Mitigation  Center  (NDMC)  at  the  University  of  Ne-
braska, Lincoln. The NDMC director co-chairs the interagency and interstate NIDIS
Implementation  Team  with  the  NIDIS  director.  The  following  are  collaborative  ac-
tivities led by the NDMC using, in part, funds provided by NOAA Grants:
Mitigation measures already underway:

(1) Nebraska  Rural  Response  Hotline:  Interchurch  Ministries  of  Nebraska,  an
interdenominational  non-profit  organization  based  in  Lincoln,  spearheaded
the establishment of the Nebraska Rural Response Hotline during the farm
crisis  of  the  1980s.  The  Hotline  has  grown  steadily  in  both  the  number  of
calls it receives and in the resources and partnerships available to help call-
ers,  as  responders  listened  to  needs  and  found  ways  to  meet  them.  In  2007
it took nearly 5,000 calls. Among the ways they assist are listening to indi-
vidual  farmers  and  ranchers  to  help  identify  options  in  a  crisis,  providing
vouchers  for  counseling  and  referrals  to  other  professional  services,  and  or-
ganizing  regular  workshops  around  the  state  focusing  on  needs  such  as  fi-
nancial and legal planning. Drought is one of many stressors facing the ag-
ricultural community.

(2) Nebraska  Health  &  Human  Services  is  working  with  municipalities  to  re-

duce the vulnerability of their water supplies.

(3) Increased soil moisture monitoring.

Planned mitigation measures:

Nebraska has a drought mitigation plan that has identified more strategies, some
of  which  will  require  additional  funding,  either  for  agency  staff  time  or  for  assist-
ance  or  incentives  for  farmers  and  ranchers.  The  planned  mitigation  activities  are
included in the appendices of the state’s drought plan (http://carc.agr.ne.gov/docs/
NebraskaDrought.pdf).

Some  agricultural  policies  may  lead  to  hazard-resistance  or  to  practices  that  in-
crease  vulnerability.  This  is  of  increasing  importance  because  of  the  disruptions  in
food  security  that  may  come  about  as  a  result  of  climate  change  (irrespective  of
what drives that change).
Q2. What are your views on balancing the demand for various uses of water, includ-
ing,  drinking  water;  agricultural  uses;  energy  generation;  habitat,  especially  for
endangered species; and recreation?

A2. In  addition  to  water  supply  planning,  both  urban  and  rural  land-use  practices
can  either  contribute  to  drought  vulnerability  or  to  drought  resistance.  In  most
cases,  practices  that  build  resilience  to  drought  can  also  build  resilience  to  other
possible  threats,  including  wildfires,  energy  production  reliability,  and  economic
down-turns. In general, practices that lead to increased soil fertility, redundancy in
natural  systems,  and  increased  biodiversity  build  resilience.  Practices  that  encour-
age more risk-taking and deplete natural resources faster than they are replenished
increase vulnerability.

Recreation  forms  the  backbone  of  the  economy  for  many  western  states.  The  im-
pacts of impending changes are anticipated to be felt by the environment sector, and
these will impact the environmental services that provide tourism, recreational and

other  economic  generators  for  rural  communities.  Environmental  requirements  for
water  are  actually  minuscule  compared  with  municipal,  industry,  and  agricultural
needs. In some regions environmental needs are less than 10 percent of supply with
agriculture,  household,  and  industrial  needs  accounting  for  the  rest.  The  economic
benefits  of  environmental  services  outweigh  the  costs  of  their  water  needs  and  as
such,  efficiency  in  the  other  three  sectors  will  provide  a  large  economic  and  social
benefit.  Multi-objective  planning  is  a  logical  approach  for  developing  strategies  to
pursue complex goals.
