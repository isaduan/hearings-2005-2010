WEDNESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  28,  2005

COMMITTEE COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:01  a.m.  in  room

of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Good  morning,  I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses 
who have come to be with us today, and the members of the Base-
ball  Hall  of  Fame  who  honor  us  by  coming  to  this  hearing  also. 
And,  for  those  who  believe  that  professional  sports  does  not  have 
an impact on the American public and our youth, I would point out 
an  interesting  fact  that  I  just  learned  this  morning.  A  member  of 
my  staff,  Aaron  Saunders,  was  named  after  you,  Mr.  Aaron,  after 
his  father  witnessed  your  714th  home  run  in  Cincinnati  in  1974. 
So,  we  sort  of  have  a  Senate  family  connection  to  you,  let’s  put  it 
that way. 

I  thank  Senator  McCain  for  asking  to  chair  this  hearing  and  for 
his  commitment  to  demanding  fair  competition  at  all  levels  of  our 
sports  world.  And  we  welcome  as  a  guest  member  of  this  Com-
mittee  at  this  time,  Senator  Bunning  whose  baseball  career  and 
dedication  to  preserving  the  integrity  of  our  national  game  speak 
for themselves. 

As  someone  who  pushed  for  the  creation  of  the  U.S.  Olympic 
Committee  and  who  has  been  involved  with  sports  issues  in  the 
Senate  for  over  37  years,  I  have  become  increasingly  concerned 
with  the  dramatic  increase  in  doping  at  all  levels  of  athletics,  par-
ticularly among our youth. 

In  a  2003  survey  of  over  15,000  high  school  students,  the  U.S. 
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  found  that  more  than 
6  percent  of  high  school  students  admitted  to  using  non-prescrip-
tion  illegal  steroids  at  some  point  in  their  lives.  And  that  is  unac-
ceptable to us. 

Doping  is  a  stain  on  all  levels  of  athletics.  It  taints  the  accom-
plishments  of  our  elite  athletes,  creates  unattainable  expectations 
for our young athletes, and threatens their physical well-being.

I  want  to  commend  all  of  the  leagues  for  addressing  their  drug 
problems  over  the  past  18  months.  There  are  two  key  elements  to 
an  effective  drug  policy:  deterrence  and  credibility.  Unfortunately 
I’ve got to say to you gentlemen, we would not be holding this hear-
ing if all of your policies satisfied those threshold elements. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  Senators  McCain  and  Bunning, 
and the rest of the Committee, and the Senate to report legislation, 
and  consider  legislation  on  this  subject.  John,  thank  you  very 
much.  I  know  there  are  problems  in  our  schedules  today,  I  don’t 
know  what  you’re  going  to  do.  I  am  going  to  go  to  that  meeting  at 
10:30, but I thank you for taking over, I think you ought to tell us 
what your plans are. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
Thank  you  for  your  courtesy  in  allowing  me  to  hold  the  gavel  this 
morning,  and  I  appreciate  the  many  courtesies  you’ve  extended  to 
me, but most importantly your continued involvement in this issue. 
I  will  make  a  very  brief  statement.  I  would  ask  my  colleagues 
also  to  make  brief  statements  and  then  if  it’s  agreeable,  we  have 
some special witnesses this morning that were not on the list, that 
perhaps  I  would  ask  to  come  forward  to  make  statements  as  well. 
So  again,  I  thank  you,  Senator  Stevens,  and  we’ll  just  press  on 
with  this  hearing.  Senator  Bunning,  welcome,  and  thank  you  for 
your involvement. I’ll be brief. 

Today’s  hearing  is  about  the  integrity  of  professional  sports.  It’s 
more  importantly,  perhaps,  about  young  Americans.  Young  Ameri-
cans who believe that the only way that they would be able to per-
form  at  a  Major  League  professional  level  is  through  the  ingestion 
of  performance-enhancing  drugs.  The  House  of  Representatives, 
some  time  ago  had  a  hearing  and  some  of  the  witnesses  were  the 
family  members  of  young  people  who  had  committed  suicide  while 
under the influence of these substances, and that’s really what it’s 
all about. 

There  are  some  people  who  would  say  Congress  has  no  business 
in  this  issue.  Well,  I  would  make  two  points.  One,  we  have  not 
acted—professional sports have not acted. And two, we have an ob-
ligation  to  young  people  to  do  everything  in  our  power  to  prevent 
them  from  succumbing  to  this  terrible  attraction  in  the  belief  that 
the only way they can perform at a Major League professional level 
is  if  they  ingest  these  substances.  Ask  any  high  school  coach  in 
America, as I have, many high school coaches who have told me the 
same thing. 

I  want  to  finally  say,  we  don’t  want  to  have  to  act  legislatively. 
We  know  that  this  is  a  labor  and  management  issue.  But  we  have 
the additional obligations and the fact that Major League Baseball, 
in particular, has still not been able to act. We also need to exam-
ine  what’s  going  on  with  the  other  professional  sports  regarding 
this  issue.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  be  brief  in  their  opening  re-
marks, and I would ask my friend and Baseball Hall of Fame mem-
ber, Senator Bunning to be recognized.

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM BUNNING,

U.S. SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY 

Senator  BUNNING.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  First,  I  want  to 
thank  Chairman  Stevens  and  Senator  McCain  for  the  opportunity 
to be a guest member for this hearing. Second, I and probably most 
of  the  other  Members  in  Congress  do  not  relish  the  situation  we 
are in. 

That  situation  is  being  on  the  brink  of  possibly  passing  legisla-
tion  to  clean  up  something  that  the  sports  leagues  and  players’ 
unions  should  be  able  to  clean  up  on  their  own.  But  for  whatever 
reason,  you  just  can’t  get  it  done,  and  you  can’t  get  your  act  to-
gether. 

It is impressive and amazing what you all can do. You can come 
to agreements on collective bargaining and salaries, and aspects of 
free  agency  and  trading,  and  a  host  of  other  issues.  But  for  what-
ever  reason,  some  of  you  just  cannot  strike  a  deal  on  testing  and 
penalties  for  illegal  drug  use.  I,  and  millions  of  fans,  think  that  is 
pathetic. 

Since we cannot be in the clubhouse to try and get to the bottom 
of  all  this,  we  thought  we  would  bring  you  into  this  committee 
room. We apologize for not having any showers in here. Lord knows 
we all may need a shower after this hearing to cool down, because 
it just might get a little uncomfortable in here. 

My focus is going to be on baseball, not just because I once wore 
the  uniform,  but  because  that  seems  to  be  the  biggest  problem. 
Baseball’s  Commissioner  has  put  forward  a  drug  testing  and  pen-
alty  proposal.  While  I  am  not  100  percent  in  agreement  with  it,  it 
is a start. 

While I think the Commissioner took too long to put forward his 
plan,  I  realize  he  had  to  deal  with  owners  and  build  somewhat  of 
a  consensus  with  them.  At  times  I  am  sure  it  was  kind  of  like 
herding cats for the Commissioner. 

But  the  baseball  players’  union  has  not  exactly  been  timely  and 
pro-active in addressing the steroids issue. I know a bit about base-
ball  players’  unions  because  I  and  some  of  my  former  baseball  col-
leagues here, helped start it. Some of them are here. Robin Roberts 
is  here  and  Bob  Feller  and  a  few  others.  Yes,  for  the  record  this 
conservative Republican helped form a union. Back then, it was all 
about making sure players had fair salaries and fair pensions. 

These  were  important  issues  to  help  protect  active  players  and 
retirees. But now? But now whether it is true or not, the perception 
is  that  the  baseball  players’  union  is  protecting  players  who  use 
steroids and other illegal performance-enhancing drugs. 

Believe me, that was not something we ever envisioned the play-
ers’  union  doing.  And  I  hope  it  is  not  what  the  union  is  doing.  I 
see some of my fellow Hall of Famers here. Thank you for coming. 
I spent part of my career in the American League and did not have 
to pitch to Henry Aaron very often. 

I  know  they  are  concerned  about  steroids  and  not  just  how  they 
affect the integrity of the game and the way they distort statistical 
records  that  took  years  and  years  for  some  members  sitting  out 
there to achieve. 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appreciate  it,  and  I’ll  get  with  the 

questions later on.

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Bunning,  for  everything 
that  you  do  on  this  issue  and  many  others.  Senator  Dorgan,  brief 
remarks please, from all of my colleagues. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much.  Three 
and  half  years  ago  when  I  chaired  the  subcommittee  that  dealt 
with  among  other  things,  sports,  at  your  request  I  held  the  first 
hearing,  I  believe,  on  baseball  steroids  in  this  Committee.  Let  me 
say, that some things have happened since that time, some positive 
things. But Mr. Chairman, let me tell you something that I’ve told 
you before many times. Roger Maris comes from the great State of 
North  Dakota.  In  1961  he  broke  a  34-year  record,  hit  61  home 
runs,  a  record  that  has  stood  for  34  years  and  he  did  it  without 
steroids. 

And  Mr.  Chairman,  some  of  us  think  that  home  run  record  still 
stands.  And  that’s  a  sad  comment  about  baseball.  I  regret  to  say 
that,  but  it’s  a  sad  comment  about  baseball.  We  held  the  hearing 
three  and  half  years  ago  as  I  indicated.  We  made  some  progress, 
but  I  still  find  it  unbelievable  that  not  everyone  believes  the  same 
thing.  There  ought  not  be  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  base-
ball.  There  ought  not  be  a  question  about  a  rigorous  testing  pro-
gram and there ought not be questions about penalties. 

Let  me  say,  Mr.  Fehr,  you’ve  been  here  twice,  and  in  my  judg-
ment  the  players’  union  in  baseball  has  given  ground  only  grudg-
ingly, and in every circumstance only grudgingly, arguing that this 
is a part of collective bargaining, and it’s a matter of privacy. 

Mr. Fehr, you and the players have lost that argument. It is not 
about  privacy,  and  it  is  not  about  collective  bargaining.  That  issue 
is  over.  And  I  hope  that  finally  this  hearing  will  end  the  need  for 
future hearings and everyone will understand there cannot be per-
formance-enhancing  drugs  in  professional  sports.  There  must  be 
aggressive testing and aggressive penalties for their use. 
STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH,

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Chairman McCain. Gentlemen, all of 
you, thank you for participating in this hearing. I was a very young 
boy  when  my  family  moved  from  Oregon  to  Washington  D.C.  and 
soon  I  found  myself  in  love  with  the  Washington  Senators.  One  of 
the earliest memories of my life was watching Mickey Mantle beat 
my Senators, by hitting a home run out of the park in the old Grif-
fith  Stadium.  As  an  adult  I  have  watched  and  thrilled  as  records 
have  fallen  by  today’s  great  players  and  yet  now  as  the  father  of 
a 16-year-old, watching further records that I once watched be cre-
ated.  To  watch  them  fall,  with  asterisks  by  them  is  very  dis-
tressing. 

It isn’t just that. Far more important to 16-year-olds is the exam-
ple which Major League players obviously are called upon to set for 
our young people. So I would hope, Mr. Chairman, that the leaders 
that  are  at  the  table  today,  would  understand  the  importance  of  a 
‘‘three strikes and you’re out’’ policy to set a standard that will re-
verberate  far  beyond  the  majors,  but  to  the  little  leagues  as  well.

Every time a player tests positive for drugs, he casts doubt not only 
on  his  own  achievements  but  on  the  achievements  of  all  players, 
and  I  do  respect  the  players  unions’  obligations  to  defend  every 
player.  But  I  hope  it  is  fully  understood  that  when  it  protects 
cheaters it threatens the rest of the players who are playing by the 
rules. 

I  close,  Mr.  Chairman,  by  simply  noting  a  quote  from  Little 
League  Baseball’s  International  President  to  Major  League  Base-
ball,  and  the  Major  League  Players  Association.  Said  he  ‘‘We  all 
must  accept  the  fact  that  children  are  affected  by  the  actions  of 
Major  Leaguers...tougher  polices  in  dealing  with  steroids  among 
Major  Leaguers  will  help  convey  to  young  people  the  seriousness 
with  which  this  problem  is  regarded  by  players  and  Major  League 
baseball.’’  All  of  us  in  baseball  are  counting  on  you  to  do  the  right 
thing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  may  enter 

a longer statement in the record, but just say this. 

Senator MCCAIN. Without objection. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’m  very  con-
cerned about this issue. Commissioner Selig was in Seattle in April 
and  gave  a  speech  at  a  luncheon  commemorating  and  celebrating 
Ichiro Suzuki’s accomplishments from the last season. 

At  the  time,  he  spoke  about  the  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out’’ 
policy.  And  the  Seattle  Mariners  have  taken  very  swift  action,  not 
only  with  three  Major  League  players,  but  eight  Minor  League 
players. I think our franchise has probably taken very decisive and 
swift  action.  But  yet  I’m  left  with  the  conclusion,  after  hearing  all 
of this in April and seeing all these actions in April, that somehow 
collective bargaining is stopping us from getting real results on this 
issue.  And  it  seems  that  only  will  we  get  movement  on  a  negotia-
tion between the baseball union and Major League Baseball if Con-
gress  and  the  United  States  Senate  has  hearings.  I  think  we  have 
to have more progress in this. 

Currently  steroids  have  been  used  not  only  by  professional  ath-
letes  but  younger  athletes,  and  the  fact  that  so  many  of  these 
younger  athletes  are  now  finding  this  acceptable  because  Major 
League  Baseball  hasn’t  acted  and  taken  swift  action,  I  think  is  a 
problem.  So,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing, 
and thank you for your continued leadership on this issue. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you. 
Senator Allen. 

STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE ALLEN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator  ALLEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  People  of  America 
love  sports,  and  the  reason  is,  is  that  everyone’s  got  an  equal  op-
portunity to compete and succeed based upon their own hard work, 
their strategies and execution. 

We  look  at  sports,  and  I  do,  and  I  grew  up  in  sports,  playing  it, 
with my father’s teams. But it is a meritocracy, Mr. Chairman. You 
don’t  care  about  someone’s  race,  their  religion,  their  ethnicity,  all

you  care  about  is  whether  they  can  contribute  to  the  team  effort. 
And I think this country loves sports because it is that meritocracy, 
it’s what we should aspire to for our society. 

There are certain elements of it, it’s a level playing field. It’s also 
something  that  is  admired  by  young  people.  As  a  pup  growing  up, 
I liked Johnny Unitas, and Roman Gabriel, and Deacon Jones, and 
later  on,  Billy  Kilmer  and  Diron  Talbert.  My  kids  admire  people 
like Jerry Rice, and Tim Brown, and Cadillac Williams. And others 
in  other  sports,  it  was  Jerry  West  and  Elgin  Baylor,  you  know 
you’d  think  of  them  all.  Sandy  Koufax,  Minnie  Minoso,  Ernie 
Banks, and in hockey I loved all the Montreal Canadiens. And they 
didn’t wear helmets then so you could see what they looked like on 
the ice. 

The point is people look up to these players. The integrity of the 
sport  is  essential.  Statistics  matter,  that  makes  it  interesting,  but 
especially  young  people  if  they  see  that  they  don’t  have  to  work 
hard,  lift  weights,  run,  exercise,  whatever  all  the  training  is,  and 
you can get it out of a bottle, it sends the wrong message. 

Now we’re going to be looking at legislation here, let’s make sure 
that  this  legislation  while  not  perfect,  if  the  Federal  Government 
is  going  to  act,  does  not  harm  what  some  of  the  leagues  do.  Let’s 
not stereotype every one of the leagues as being in the same situa-
tion. I look at the NFL as one who doesn’t wait around for the Fed-
eral Government or the FDA to act, they work together. 

Mr.  Upshaw  and  Mr.  Tagliabue,  and  the  players  and  owners 

work well together. 

Senator MCCAIN. The Senator’s time has expired. 
Senator  ALLEN.  I  hope  Mr.  Chairman,  that  we’re  going  to  make 
sure  as  we  work  through  here  that  this  meritocracy  will  continue 
to  be  admired.  And  I  thank  you,  and  our  witnesses  for  appearing 
today. 

Senator MCCAIN. Senator Stevens. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  and  the  witnesses  who  have 
come,  I  want  to  apologize  for  my  conflicts  today.  We’re  just  over-
whelmed with issues pertaining to Katrina and Rita, and you’ll see 
Members  come  and  go  here  while  you’re  here.  We  thought  about 
canceling  this,  but  I  think  this  is  of  overwhelming  importance  too, 
so  I  congratulate  Senator  McCain  for  wanting  to  continue.  And  I 
hope  he  does  continue,  but  there’s  a  series  of  meetings  going  on 
now that many of us will have to go to. I apologize for leaving. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Senator Stevens.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’ve  been  a 
baseball  fan  since  I  was  six,  and  I  still  am.  But  I  will  have  to  say 
that I’m mightily disillusioned by what is taking place. I agree with 
Senator  Dorgan,  that  the  Major  League  home  run  record,  was  set 
by  Roger  Maris,  and  has  never  been  broken.  I  don’t  know  why  it 
is  that  we  have  to  keep  doing  this.  We  have  these  meetings  and 
I,  for  one,  am  tired  of  them.  I  particularly  single  out  baseball,  and 
in  baseball  I  particularly  single  out  those  who  represent  the  play-
ers.  Because  I  think  they,  as  has  been  said,  negotiate  reluctantly

if at all. I think I saw a letter that was sent the day before yester-
day, not to the Commissioner but to the press. Negotiating through 
the  press,  not  with  the  Commissioner  is  not  a  very  good  idea,  and 
I don’t know from management’s point of view, whether they knew 
anything  about  the  great  chase  of  Sosa  and  McGwire,  and  what 
was  going  on  with  those  folks  and  whether  they  were  doing  that 
to  bring  baseball  back  to  where  it  belonged.  Because  baseball  had 
been  suffering  on  crowds  and  that  really  did,  in  fact,  solve  the 
problem. 

But for those of us who absolutely love the sport, who are fanati-
cally  devoted  to  it,  and  spend  too  much  time  watching  it,  as  Jim 
Bunning well knows, we can’t go on with this. I have no hesitation 
whatsoever  in  singling  out  a  particular  sport,  or  all  sports.  And 
having  Federal  legislation  that  mandates  what  they  do.  That’s  not 
what the Congress generally does with free enterprise, but if that’s 
what  it  takes  to  get  America,  the  way  America  ought  to  be,  and 
have kids looking up to athletes the way they need to, and do, then 
I’m for it. 

Senator MCCAIN. Senator’s time has expired. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  So  I  am  impatient,  I  am  angry,  I  recog-
nize  that  most  of  the  sports  here  are  doing  the  best  they  can.  But 
baseball is not. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

I  want  to  thank  Senator  McCain  for  holding  this  hearing  today,  although  I  am 
deeply  disappointed  that  we  have  to  hold  another  hearing  on  this  topic.  We  have 
a  number  of  Hall  of  Fame  baseball  players  in  attendance  today  and  I  would  like 
to recognize their continuing commitment to baseball. I know that they care deeply 
about the future of the game, as do I. 

Before  I  start,  I  wanted  to  mention  again  at  this  hearing  that  my  son  has  the 

good fortune of being married to Commissioner Tagliabue’s daughter. 

Unfortunately,  I  am  not  sure  that  everyone  here  today  shares  our  deep  concerns 
that continuing steroid use in baseball is having a devastating impact on the game 
and on the next generation of athletes. 

Eighteen  months  ago,  I  told  almost  the  exact  same  group  of  people  testifying  be-
fore  the  Committee  that  in  my  opinion  Roger  Maris  still  holds  the  single  season 
home  run  record.  The  news  stories  of  the  last  six  months  certainly  reinforce  that 
view  for  me  and  millions  of  other  fans.  I  will  reiterate  that  is  my  view  that  use  of 
steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs has no place in sports at any level, 
at any time. 

The NFL has an aggressive testing program and significant penalties for individ-
uals  who  test  positive  for  steroids  or  other  banned  substances.  The  results  of  the 
NFL’s policies can be seen in the very small percentage of players who test positive 
for banned substances. NFL players and owners recognize that their sport would be 
better off if everyone played by the same rules. 

I  know  the  National  Basketball  League  and  the  National  Hockey  League  have 
reached agreements with their respective players’ unions on steroid policies. It is my 
understanding  that  these  policies  will  go  into  effect  during  the  2006  season.  I  am 
pleased to see that these leagues have endorsed substantially more rigorous testing 
regimes  as  well  as  much  more  significant  penalties  for  their  players  who  test  posi-
tive for illegal substances. 

Unfortunately, Major League Baseball and its players have not achieved the same 
level  of  consensus  on  this  issue,  which  is  outrageous  given  the  fact  that  baseball  is 
the sport with the largest problem. 

I  will  also  reiterate  that  I  place  much  of  the  blame  squarely  on  the  players,  who 
continue  to  resist  meaningful  testing  and  disciplinary  measures.  I  also  blame  the 
owners  who  have  spent  more  of  their  energy  managing  the  public  relations  aspect 
of  steroids  abuse  instead  of  focusing  their  energies  on  cracking  down  on  the  prob-
lem.

I  am  a  co-sponsor  of  legislation  that  would  take  steroids  policy  out  of  the  hands 
of the leagues. I did not take this step lightly. It was a sign of my growing frustra-
tion with baseball and other leagues’ inability to police themselves. I know the wit-
nesses  will  offer  a  number  of  criticisms  of  the  bills,  many  of  them  are  valid.  I  cer-
tainly  do  not  want  Federal  rules  that  are  weaker  than  what  the  various  leagues 
have adopted. 

I  want  Major  League  Baseball  and  its  players  to  view  this  hearing  as  the  second 
strike. You do not want to make a third appearance before this Committee explain-
ing  why  you  cannot  make  a  voluntary  system  work.  I  also  want  to  make  it  clear 
that  I  will  be  closely  monitoring  how  the  NHL  and  NBA  implement  their  new  pro-
grams.  Too  much  is  at  stake.  Most  importantly,  the  health  of  young  people  is  at 
risk. You are role models. You set examples. 

You  must  do  the  right  thing  or  Congress  will  step  in  and  make  you  do  it.  If  it 
does  not  appear  that  the  leagues  are  making  any  real  progress  in  addressing  this 
issue, I will work with Senator McCain, Senator Bunning, and others to pass legis-
lation. 

I look forward to hearing from the panel today.

Senator MCCAIN. Senator Sununu. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  don’t  have  an 
opening  statement  and  I  appreciate  the  panel  being  here.  I’m  sure 
there are zillions of other places you would rather be. But I do ap-
preciate the NFL and the other professional sports leagues for pro-
viding the model for testing that they have. Of course I appreciate 
the  Commissioner  and  those  in  Major  League  Baseball  for  at  least 
beginning the process of implementing a testing plan and look for-
ward  to  hearing  how  the  implementation  of  that  plan  has  pro-
gressed, how it might be improved, and appreciate the time. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator MCCAIN. Senator Nelson. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the consequences of 
what we’re talking about today are enormous, because we’re seeing 
the spread of the use of steroids among young athletes particularly 
in  high  school.  Their  steroid  use  is  up,  it’s  more  than  doubled 
among  high  school  students  from  1991  to  2003,  according  to  the 
Centers  for  Disease  Control.  Last  year,  one  school  district  in  my 
state, Polk County, became the first in Florida to establish random 
testing  for  high  school  athletes.  And  then  the  Florida  legislature 
tried  and  failed  to  require  steroid  testing  for  all  high  school  ath-
letes,  the  schools  and  the  states  push  back  by  saying  that  it’s  too 
costly.  So  I’m  directing  our  staff  to  draft  Federal  legislation  that 
would  help  states  with  the  resources  they  need  to  curb  the  use  of 
steroids.  It  would  provide  Federal  grants  directly  to  the  states,  so 
that they can develop and implement steroid testing programs. 

And  I  think  in  conclusion  I’ll  say,  I  think  it’s  time  for  all  of  you 
to get involved in these kinds of ways, and I ask each of you testi-
fying today to begin a major multi-sport, national advertising cam-
paign, and it could be paid for by the leagues and their players and 
it could be directed at young people. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator MCCAIN. Senator Lautenberg.

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I 
want  to  have  a  few  words,  not  strictly  as  a  Senator,  but  also  as  a 
grandfather. And one of my grandsons who’s 9 years old follows the 
New York Yankees so ardently that last spring before baseball sea-
son  began,  he  wrote  an  article  that  assessed  the  Yankees  chances 
of winning their division this year. The article was very insightful, 
it  revealed  the  extent  of  his  love  for  the  game  of  baseball  and  his 
allegiance  to  that  particular  team.  Any  other  team  representation 
here,  forgive  me.  He  looks  up  to  the  players,  and  in  his  eyes,  they 
truly  loom  larger  than  life.  And  of  course  there  are  millions  of 
young  people  like  my  grandson,  they  idolize  professional  athletes 
who  play  baseball,  football,  basketball,  you  name  it.  And  I  would 
hate to have to explain to my grandson or any other young person 
that  this  respect  and  admiration  was  misplaced.  I’d  hate  to  have 
to  break  his  heart  by  telling  him  that  some  of  his  heroes  were 
cheating. And I’d hate to——

Senator  MCCAIN.  I’d  like  to  remind  the  Senator,  we  have  a  two-

minute time limit here this morning. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  OK.  We’re  just  about  there.  And  I’d  hate 
to see a game that’s inspired generations of Americans, become for-
ever  tainted  by  scandal.  Mr.  Chairman,  we’ve  come  to  realize  that 
this  is  really  a  serious  problem.  And  I  commend  you  for  holding 
this hearing. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Mr. Chairman, 
I want to speak not as a Senator, but as a grandfather. 
One of my grandsons follows the New York Yankees so ardently, that last spring, 
before  the  baseball  season  began,  he  wrote  an  article  that  assessed  the  Yankees’ 
chances  of  winning  their  division  this  year.  The  article  was  very  insightful  and  it 
revealed  the  extent  of  his  love  for  the  game  of  baseball  and  his  allegiance  to  the 
Yankees. 

He looks up to the players—in his eyes, they truly loom larger than life.
Of  corse  there  are  millions  of  young  people  just  like  my  grandson.  They  idolize 

professional athletes who play baseball, football, basketball, soccer and hockey. 

I  would  hate  to  have  to  explain  to  my  grandson,  or  any  other  young  person,  that 

this respect and admiration was misplaced. 

I  would  hate  to  have  to  break  his  heart  by  telling  him  that  some  of  his  heroes 

were cheaters.

And  I  would  hate  to  see  a  game  that  has  inspired  generations  of  Americans  be-

come forever tainted by scandal. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  we  have  all  come  to  realize  that  this  really  is  a  serious 
problem.  Now  it’s  time  to  get  serious  and  agree  on  a  solution  that  we  can  all  rally 
behind.

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  Senator.  Now  I  understand  that 
Commissioner  Selig  has  brought  five  individuals  with  him  this 
morning  who  are  amongst  the  most  respected  and  admired  people 
in  America.  And  if  it’s  agreeable  to  you,  Commissioner,  we’d  ask 
them  to  come  and  sit  next  to  you,  one  by  one  and  make  a  brief 
statement  since  they  have  come  here,  and  we’d  like  to  begin  with 
Hank  Aaron,  if  that’s  agreeable,  sir.  Thank  you  for  coming  this 
morning, Mr. Aaron, you honor us with your presence.

Mr.  AARON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  is  the 

first time I’ve been a lead off though. 

Senator MCCAIN. I’m sure you’ll hit a home run here. 
Mr. AARON. I’m used to cleaning up. But I’m here because of my 
involvement with the Boys and Girls Clubs for many years, and in 
traveling around the country I think I was saddened by some of the 
things  that  I  hear  from  my  colleagues  and  some  things  that  I’ve 
heard  from  drug  testing,  and  all  the  hearings.  And  I’m  here  this 
morning to support the Commissioner, and also to support tougher 
anti-drug  action.  I  think  that  we  need  to  be  concerned  with  our 
young  people  because  they  are  the  ones  that  are  the  future  of  this 
country.  And  if  we  don’t  protect  them,  are  we  not  going  to  protect 
this  country.  Baseball  is  just  a  small  part  of  all  of  the  things  that 
we  are  capable  of  doing  in  this  country.  So  I  want  to  applaud  the 
Commissioner, and I also just want to make sure that whatever we 
do, we make sure that we clean up baseball. Thank you very much. 
Senator MCCAIN. Sir, may I exercise the prerogative of the Chair 

and ask you one question? 

Mr. AARON. Sure. 
Senator MCCAIN. What should be done about records that are set 

that are tainted by the use of steroids? 

Mr.  AARON.  I  think  that’s  going  to  be—Mr.  Chairman,  I  think 
that’s  going  to  be  left  up  to  the  Commissioner  and  the  rules  com-
mittee.  They  will  probably  have  to  go  back  and  look  at  some  of 
those things that happened. That’s the only answer that I can give 
you at this time. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  sir,  and  thank  you  for  your  mag-

nificent work as an outstanding American. 

Mr. AARON. Thank you very much. 
Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Brock, welcome. 
Mr.  BROCK.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  my  name  is  Lou  Brock, 
and I’m here to represent baseball and its fight and its struggle to 
confront  steroid  use  in  America’s  sports.  I  believe  that  we  have  to 
make  some  radical  move  to  get  the  attention  of  everyone.  Radical, 
simply  meaning  that  steroids  are  radical.  And  its  movement,  and 
it  can  only  move  if  we  touch  it  with  our  hands.  So  we  need  to  be 
able  to  have  a  radical  decision.  A  radical  decision  that  points  out 
and  states  our  belief  in  America.  And  that  is  cheaters  can’t  win. 
And  steroids  has  put  us  in  a  position  that  it’s  OK  to  cheat.  And 
I think the stiffer the penalty, the greater the message will be sent. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  very  much,  sir,  and  thank  you  for 
joining  us.  Mr.  Sandberg.  Resident  of  the  great  State  of  Arizona. 
Mr.  SANDBERG.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  thank  you 
personally for all that you do for the great State of Arizona. I enjoy 
living out there, and I love the golf courses, by the way. 

Senator MCCAIN. We appreciate your taxes. 
Mr.  SANDBERG.  I’m  here  today,  because  I  love  the  game  of  base-
ball.  Exactly  two  months  ago,  I  gave  an  induction  speech  in  Coop-
erstown  and  I  reflected  on  my  career,  and  I  talked  about  players 
respecting  the  game.  Players  playing  the  game  the  right  way.  To 
me that’s respecting the uniform they wear, respecting their team, 
respecting their opponents, the media, and the fans.

We  do  have  a  problem  in  baseball,  and  using  steroids  is  not  re-
specting the game. I’m here today in hope of a strict policy for base-
ball  that  has  strict  penalties  for  the  cheaters  in  the  game.  Fifty, 
100, life, is a strict policy. And what I hope for the game is players 
that  are  respectful.  And  we  here  today  owe  America’s  pastime  a 
strict policy. Thank you. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Niekro. 
Mr. NIEKRO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator MCCAIN. Welcome, sir. 
Mr. NIEKRO. I’m here, I had the honor to play the game of base-
ball  28  years,  23  in  the  Majors,  and  5  in  the  Minor  Leagues,  I 
guess  we  just  didn’t  have  those  problems  back  there,  then.  If  we 
did,  it  certainly  wasn’t  recognized.  I  am  here  to  support  the  policy 
of the Commissioner of Baseball. I do believe that a first offender—
50  games,  sometimes  I  don’t  think  that’s  even  enough.  But  that  is 
a starting point. I have been under the guidance of Don Fehr, and 
Marvin  Miller  when  they  first  brought  the  union  together.  And 
they  have  done  a  lot  for  the  players,  extremely  a  lot.  I  would  not 
be  living  in  a  house,  and  driving  the  cars,  or  whatever  if  it  wasn’t 
for  the  association  of,  basically,  baseball  players.  But  I  do  believe 
that they can step up. I know they have been meeting a lot in try-
ing to put this problem to an end. And it is a problem. I would like 
to  see  the  Association  of  Players  come  up  and  come  to  the  level  of 
50  games,  at  least  50  games.  And  I  am  here  to  strictly  back  Mr. 
Selig’s  proposal  of  first  time  offender,  50  games,  and  sometimes  I 
don’t think that’s enough. Thank you. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, sir. Thank you for coming today. 
And finally Mr. Robin Roberts, who mentioned that his perform-

ances were far superior to Mr. Bunning’s. 

Mr. ROBERTS. That’s not true, Mr. Chairman. That’s not fair. But 
welcome  to  all  of  you.  The  last  time  I  was  here  at  a  meeting  like 
this, was when Senator Kefauver called me. And they were arguing 
about the reserve clause. And I got a—I get the same pay this time 
I think, Bud, don’t I? 

Mr. SELIG. That’s correct. 
Mr.  ROBERTS.  Jim,  Senator  Bunning.  Pardon  me,  Jimmy.  He 
mentioned  that  he  and  I  were  very  active  in  starting  the  Players 
Association, and there have been a number of items that the play-
ers  have  fought  for  and  I  disagreed  with  and  everything  else.  But 
I’m not in a position of helping out at all. But I think, overall, Jim 
and I can be proud of the fact that the Players Association and the 
owners  have  come  up  with  a  beautiful  sport,  followed  by  many 
great  athletes  still  playing.  And  what  we’re  talking  about  today  is 
certainly something that has to be reckoned with. 

Of  all  the  things  that  I’ve  agreed  with,  on  Don  and  the  Players 
Association, I disagree. I don’t believe that with his power and with 
his—that  he  can  no  longer  recognize  the  fact  that  this  has  got  to 
be  something,  he’s  got  to  say  to  the  Commissioner,  you  represent 
the fans, we represent the fans, the fans demand this, and I think 
he’ll  most  important  to  go  along  with  what  the  Commissioner  has 
proposed,  and  not  make  you  gentlemen  waste  your  time  anymore 
with that thing.

It  is  a  terrible  thing.  I  do  think  I  would  like  to  see  an  amnesty 
as far as records that have gone behind. Because nobody knows ex-
actly who did what, and as much as I respect Roger Maris, and the 
rest  of  them.  The  show  they  put  on,  the  fact  that  Barry  Bonds  is 
hitting  them  right  now,  and  I  know  he  mustn’t  be  on  them  now, 
I don’t know. But he’s a phenomenal athlete, probably the greatest 
hitter that ever lived. And you can taint him anyway you want, but 
the  guys  playing  the  game  today,  they  take  better  care  of  them-
selves, they’re outstanding athletes, and I do think that Don is the 
one that can straighten this out immediately and you guys and la-
dies can work on other things. Thank you for having me. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  sir,  thank  you  for  being  here.  And 
I  know  that’s  a  little  unusual,  but  I  thought  it  was  important  to 
hear  from  these  individuals  who  have  done  so  much  for  America’s 
pastime  and  I  appreciate  the  patience  of  our  witnesses.  And  now 
our  panel  consists  of  Allan  H.  ‘‘Bud’’  Selig,  Commissioner  of  Major 
League  Baseball,  Don  Fehr,  the  Executive  Director  and  General 
Counsel  of  the  Major  League  Baseball  Players  Association,  Paul

ciation. Welcome. We’ll begin with you, Mr. Selig. 
STATEMENT  OF  ALLAN  H.  SELIG,  COMMISSIONER,  MAJOR 
LEAGUE  BASEBALL;  ACCOMPANIED  BY  HANK  AARON,  LOU 
BROCK,  PHIL  NIEKRO,  ROBIN  ROBERTS,  AND  RYNE 
SANDBERG, MEMBERS, BASEBALL’S HALL OF FAME 
Mr.  SELIG.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
Chairman,  the  Ranking  Member  and  the  Committee  members  for 
inviting me to testify today. 

I  have  the  distinct  privilege  of  serving  as  the  ninth  Commis-
sioner  of  Baseball.  As  Commissioner,  the  most  important  point  I 
want  to  make  this  morning  is  that  my  top  priority  is  to  eradicate 
performance-enhancing  substances  from  baseball.  That  is  why  I 
proposed last April a tough, new 50-games, 100-games, life suspen-
sion  discipline  schedule  for  cheaters  who  use  steroids.  Members  of 
the Committee, it is time for this proposal to be accepted. 

As  you  know  now,  five  members  of  Baseball’s  Hall  of  Fame—
Hank  Aaron,  Lou  Brock,  Phil  Niekro,  Robin  Roberts,  and  Ryne 
Sandberg—have joined me today to support my proposal to toughen 
Major League Baseball’s drug-testing program. I also have with me 
a letter from the President of Little League Baseball urging tough-
er penalties for those who use steroids. 

I  have  often  spoken  about  baseball’s  role  as  a  social  institution, 
and  how  Jackie  Robinson  breaking  the  game’s  color  barrier  on 
April  15,  1947,  was  baseball’s  proudest  moment.  As  the  national 
pastime, we have social responsibilities that we take very seriously. 
But  meeting  those  responsibilities  can  be  difficult  and  complex. 
Baseball presently has a problem with performance-enhancing sub-

stances.  This  is  a  problem  for  several  reasons.  First,  players  who 
use steroids are cheating which directly affects the integrity of the 
game. Second, the use of steroids presents serious health issues for 
those  who  are  taking  them.  Third—and  this  directly  impacts  the 
social  responsibility  that  the  game  has  to  its  fans  and  to  the  com-
munities in which we play—the use of steroids by our players influ-
ences the youth of America. Whether we and our players like it or 
not,  they  are  role  models  and  kids  who  admire  them  are  likely  to 
emulate  what  they  do.  If  the  young  athletes  of  our  country  believe 
that  taking  steroids  may  help  them  become  Major  Leaguers,  they 
will take those substances. This must not happen. It is my goal as 
the  Commissioner  of  Baseball  to  eradicate  the  use  of  performance-
enhancing  substances  from  the  game  and  I  won’t  leave  one  stone 
unturned until that happens. 

Before  the  BALCO  investigation  and  before  President  Bush 
brought  up  the  subject  in  the  State  of  the  Union  speech,  Major 
League Baseball had recognized the seriousness of the steroid prob-
lem  and  had  begun  to  address  it.  We  banned  performance-enhanc-
ing  substances  throughout  the  Minor  Leagues  and  began  testing 
there.  But  I  could  not  unilaterally  impose  testing  in  the  Major 
Leagues,  because  drug  testing  is  a  matter  of  collective  bargaining. 
The  Major  League  Baseball  Players  Association  had  long  opposed 
any kind of testing. During our 2002 labor negotiations, testing for 
performance-enhancing substances was a priority and we were suc-
cessful,  for  the  first  time,  in  negotiating  a  testing  program.  Al-
though  it  was  not  as  comprehensive  as  I  would  have  liked,  it  was 
a first step. 

But  we  did  not  stop  there.  In  March  2004,  due  in  part  to  the 
message  from  the  President  and  this  Committee,  we  went  back  to 
the  Players  Association  and  told  them  that  the  program  we  had 
was  insufficient.  Last  January,  in  an  unprecedented  move,  Major 
League  Baseball  and  the  Players  Association  reopened  the  basic 
agreement and devised a tougher, more comprehensive drug-testing 
program that was much more effective. 

There  is  no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  the  current  testing  program 
is working. But whether or not the program is working is no longer 
the issue. The issue is integrity, my integrity, the players’ integrity, 
the  owners’  integrity,  but  most  importantly,  the  game’s  integrity. 
The integrity issue is transcendent. We must put a stop to the use 
of  steroids  and  the  best  way  is  to  put  in  place  a  drug-testing  pro-
gram  that  has  tough  discipline  and  independent  testing.  In  April, 
I  sent  a  letter  to  Don  Fehr,  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Players 
Association,  proposing  that  violators  of  the  program  be  suspended 
for 50 games for a first offense, 100 games for a second, and a life-
time  ban  for  a  third.  I  also  proposed  an  extension  of  testing  to  in-
clude  amphetamines,  increased  random  testing,  and  turning  over 
the  administration  of  the  testing  program  to  an  independent  au-
thority. 

I  believe  so  strongly  in  this  proposal  that  I  have  already  imple-
mented  the  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out’’  program  in  the  Minor 
Leagues  for  the  2006  season.  At  the  Major  League  level,  my  staff 
has diligently pressed the Players Association and, in recent weeks, 
has negotiated—as required by the National Labor Relations Act—
to effectuate the goals I articulated in my letter to Mr. Fehr. Unfor-

tunately,  the  Players  Association  has  yet  to  agree  to  the  proposal 
I made to them five months ago. This week, I received a letter from 
Mr.  Fehr  that  moves  in  the  right  direction,  but  his  reply  does  not 
go  far  enough.  Notwithstanding  my  impatience  and  profound  dis-
appointment,  I  refuse  to  give  up  and  will  continue  to  press  to 
strengthen the program. 

Senator  John  McCain  and  Senator  and  Hall  of  Famer  Jim 
Bunning each has introduced legislation that would regulate drug-
testing  programs  in  professional  sports.  It  would  be  preferable  to 
handle  this  issue  through  collective  bargaining,  but  after  waiting 
five  months  I  stand  ready  to  support  appropriate  Federal  legisla-
tion  if  Congress  becomes  convinced  that  the  collective  bargaining 
process will not yield an acceptable drug-testing program. 

While  this  process  continues,  we  have  increased  our  efforts 
where  we  can  act  unilaterally.  For  example,  in  2005,  we  signifi-
cantly increased our drug testing in the Minor Leagues, in the Do-
minican Republic and Venezuelan Summer Leagues. We conducted 
more  than  7,000  tests  and  imposed  more  than  100  suspensions  in 
the  Minor  Leagues  alone  for  players  who  tested  positive  for  per-
formance-enhancing  substances.  Recognizing  the  need  to  keep  the 
science of drug testing on the cutting edge, Major League Baseball 
has  committed  to  fund  research  by  Dr.  Donald  Catlin,  the  re-
nowned scientist who heads the World Anti-Doping Agency-accred-
ited UCLA Laboratory, in his endeavor to create a valid urine test 
for Human Growth Hormone. We are also active on the educational 
side  of  this  issue  and  have  joined  forces  with  the  Partnership  for 
a  Drug  Free  America  and  the  Taylor  Hooton  Foundation  to  help 
warn  America’s  youth  and  their  parents  about  the  health  dangers 
of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs. 

There  can  be  no  question  that  Major  League  Baseball  takes  this 
issue very seriously. As I have said many times, the elimination of 
steroids  and  performance-enhancing  substances  from  our  game 
through  a  tougher  and  more  effective  testing  program  is  essential 
to  restoring  integrity  to  the  game.  I  appreciate  the  attention  you 
are giving this issue and thank you for allowing me the opportunity 
to appear before you today.

est  moment.  As  the  National  Pastime,  we  have  social  responsibilities  that  we  take 
very seriously. But meeting those responsibilities can be difficult and complex. 

Baseball presently has a problem with performance-enhancing substances. This is 
a  problem  for  several  reasons.  First,  players  who  use  steroids  are  cheating  which 
directly  affects  the  integrity  of  the  game.  Second,  the  use  of  steroids  presents  seri-

whether  or  not  the  program  is  working  is  no  longer  the  issue.  The  issue  is

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Commissioner. 
Mr. Fehr. 

STATEMENT OF DONALD M. FEHR, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION 

Mr. FEHR. Thank you, Senator, Mr. Chairman. I guess the Chair-
man  isn’t  here  any  longer,  but  other  members  of  the  Committee, 
I  would  like  to  make  a  brief  opening,  and  ask  that  my  written 
statement be offered for the record. 

Senator MCCAIN. Without objection. 
Mr. FEHR. I’d also like to introduce Michael Weiner who’s sitting 
behind me right there. Mike is now the general counsel of the Play-
ers  Association.  I  haven’t  held  that  title  for  18  months  or  a  little 
more.  He’s  been  principally  involved  in  both  administration  and 
particularly  the  negotiations  that  Mr.  Selig  has  referred  to,  and  if 
the  matters  come  up  in  which  I  need  to  get  a  specific  answer,  I 
may ask him to reply on my behalf. 

Very briefly, Mr. Chairman, we’ve made a lot of progress. I know 
that  it  isn’t  sufficient  yet  for  some.  But  I’d  like  to  take  a  moment 
and describe it because I think that viewed fairly, it indicates that 
an  awful  lot  has  been  done.  Initially  I  would  like  to  agree  with 
Commissioner  Selig  on  one  very  important  point.  The  program  we 
have now is working. I don’t think that there is any dispute among 
us in that regard. Very briefly, at the hearing that we had in 2002 
to which I believe Senator Dorgan referred to in his opening state-
ment,  there  were  a  lot  of  things  said.  There  were  rumors  going 
around of very high percentages of Major League players that were 
using  steroids.  Remembering  however,  that  a  number  of  steroids 
were  legal  at  that  point  in  time,  such  as  Androstenedione.  We 
reached an agreement with the clubs, in which we would do a sur-
vey  test.  If  positive  tests  exceeded  a  certain  number  we  would  go 
in  2004  to  testing  with  disciplinary  consequences.  The  2003  tests 
resulted in just over 5 percent, much higher than I hoped, but that 
triggered  the  next  step,  and  in  2004  there  were  disciplinary  con-
sequences,  and  the  number  of  violations  dropped  to  about  1  per-
cent. There were 12 confirmed violations. 

Nevertheless at the hearing in March of 2004, if I recall the date 
correctly,  you  may  remember  I  was  ill  during  that  hearing  and  I 
don’t—it  may  be  fading  a  little  bit.  But  in  essence  we  were  asked 
to  do  more.  So  as  Commissioner  Selig  indicated  we  reopened  the 
agreement,  we  worked  over  that  season,  we  agreed  to  more  tests, 
we  agreed  to  off-season  tests,  we  agreed  to  increase  the  penalties, 
including  a  suspension  for  a  first-time  positive,  and  as  Senator 
Dorgan  had  requested,  public  identification  of  those  who  indicated 
that they had violated the program.

17

At  the  time,  January  of  2005,  we  had  hoped  that  we  had  taken 
a  significant  enough  step.  Players  certainly  felt  good  about  it. 
There  were  hearings  last  spring  in  the  House  in  which  we  were 
asked  once  again  to  consider  negotiations.  The  Commissioner  sent 
me a letter that he referred to in April. I responded to him the end 
of  that  month  by  indicating  that  I  would  consider  what  he  had  to 
say,  meet  with  the  players  and  discuss  it.  We  agreed  at  that  time 
that any changes would be effective for 2006, and as I indicated to 
him at the time, I was going to spend most of the summer and did, 
meeting  with  every  team,  talking  to  every  player  who  wanted  to 
talk to me, hearing all views, conveying the views of this body and 
its members and of your counterparts in the House. 

I  even  sent  tapes  of  the  House  hearings  out  to  all  of  the  clubs 

so that players could watch it if they wanted to. 

The  letter  that  I  sent  to  the  Commissioner  earlier  this  week,  I 
want  to  make  one  thing  clear,  was  not  a  new  proposal.  It  was  a 
summary  of  where  our  discussions  have  taken  us  to  date.  And 
there was nothing new in that letter to the Commissioner. Senator 
McCain  has  suggested  to  me  that  I  should  have  said  more  things 
publicly  about  our  position  before.  He  and  I  have  a  disagreement 
about that. In the past we’ve been criticized for negotiating in pub-
lic. But in any event, I wanted to make clear what our position was 
before the hearing began. 

And  we  have  reached  agreement  on  most  of  the  issues  that  are 
between  us.  We’ve  agreed  to  vastly  increase  the  number  of  tests, 
approximately  doubling  it  to  about  3,000  with  every  player  tested 
a minimum of twice. Random, unannounced testing year round; we 
have  agreed  to  a  structure  for  the  testing  of  amphetamines  which 
was  a  matter  raised  by  Senator  McCain  after  the  last  agreement 
was  reached.  And  we’re  very  close  on  a  penalty  structure.  I  don’t 
expect  that  that  will  be  a  significant  issue.  As  the  Commissioner 
said,  we’ve  reached  agreement  on  moving  a  lot  of  the  administra-
tive  functions  to  an  outside  entity  so  that  questions  that  might  be 
raised  about  that  would  no  longer  be  there.  And  the  last  major 
issue to be resolved is steroid penalties. 

And  here  again  I  think  we’re  much  closer  than  people  ever  ex-
pected  us  to  be.  On  the  second-time  penalty  we’ve  proposed  a  pre-
sumptive  penalty  of  75  games,  the  Commissioner  is  at  100,  with 
the possibility if there are mitigating circumstances it could be 50, 
if  there  are  aggravating  circumstances  it  could  be  100.  The  Com-
missioner  is  at  80,  100,  and  120.  With  respect  to  a  third  time, 
we’ve  accepted  in  principle  the  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out’’  cir-
cumstance.  Or  the  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out’’  framework,  I 
guess  perhaps  that’s  a  better  word,  with  the  provision  that  there 
be  arbitral  review  of  anything  as  severe  as  a  lifetime  sanction  to 
look at the specifics. 

Just  to  bring  everyone  up  to  date  with  matters  which  occurred 
essentially  after  my  prepared  testimony  had  been  written  on  Fri-
day,  that  I  noticed  over  the  weekend  and  I  want  to  make  certain 
there’s  no  dispute  about.  Our  proposal  on  a  third  penalty,  is  that 
the  Commissioner  may  impose  whatever  penalty  he  believes  up  to 
and  including  a  permanent  ban  as  is  appropriate  under  the  facts 
and  circumstances,  that  can  be  reviewed  by  an  arbitrator,  but  it 
could not be reduced to less than one year.

The Commissioner’s proposal is the same, except that it could not 
be  reduced  to  less  than  two  years,  which  as  I  understand  it,  and 
Bud  will  correct  me  if  I’m  wrong,  has  been  the  circumstance  for 
about  60  years  with  someone  ineligible  as  a  result  of  gambling,  or 
something like that. 

On  penalties,  the  last  thing  I’ll  say  is  that  we  believe  very 
strongly that the purpose of penalty provisions ought to be to deter. 
Not  to  punish  for  its  own  sake.  We  believe  that  the  penalty  struc-
ture  we  have  imposed  has  demonstrated  that  it  will.  The  number 
of  confirmed  positives  we  have  so  far  this  year  is  nine  and  one  of 
those  was  an  individual  in  which  the  arbitrator  found  that  the  re-
sult  had—the  positive  result  was  from  a  prior  use,  prior  to  2005 
for  which  he  had  already  been  disciplined  in  the  Minor  Leagues. 
I don’t know if that will be nine before the end of the year. We still 
have  tests  yet  to  come  and  we  have  off-season  testing  which  will 
begin  this  year.  I  would  expect  that  our  negotiations  would  con-
tinue  as  they  have  been.  The  atmosphere  which  in  baseball  has 
been for many, many years contentious on all kinds of issues as the 
Hall  of  Famers  will  certainly  remember  from  the  time  they  were 
there. These discussions have not be conducted in that atmosphere. 
It doesn’t mean that we agree on everything. 

In  conclusion,  and  I  don’t  want  to  over-extend  my  time,  Mr. 
Chairman,  we  agree  that  the  best  way  to  solve  this  matter  is 
through  collective  bargaining.  We  believe  that  we’ve  made  a  lot  of 
strides  in  the  program  which  as  the  Commissioner  indicated  is 
working  and  we  are  prepared  to  do  a  lot  more.  I  hope  and  expect 
that  when  our  negotiations  resume,  which  I  would  expect  to  be 
next week after the Jewish holidays, that we’ll be able in a reason-
able  period  of  time  to  conclude  the  discussions  on  the  issues  that 
we have remaining. 

Last  thing,  Senator  Cantwell,  I  believe,  referred  to  the  decisive 
and  swift  action  taken  by  the  Seattle  Mariners,  in  a  very  positive 
way.  The  point  I  would  like  to  make  that  with  respect  to  any  of 
those  players  who  were  on  the  40-man  roster,  that  decisive  and 
swift action was the result of and operated under the program that 
we negotiated last year. It’s not something that was done independ-
ently or outside of it. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope I did not exceed my time. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Fehr follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DONALD M. FEHR, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MAJOR LEAGUE 

BASEBALL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  name  is  Donald  M.  Fehr  and  I  am  the  Executive 
Director  of  the  Major  League  Baseball  Players  Association.  I  appreciate  this  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  today  about  what  our  union  has  done  and  is  continuing  to  do  to 
combat  the  use  of  illegal  performance-enhancing  substances  in  Major  League  Base-
ball. 

The  last  time  I  appeared  before  this  Committee,  on  March  10,  2004,  I  explained 
how  the  new  Joint  Drug  Agreement  contained  in  our  2002  collective  bargaining 
agreement  was  working.  We  had  conducted  a  year  of  survey  testing  in  2003,  which 
produced  positive  test  results  for  between  5  and  7  percent  of  players  (I  believe  the 
actual number of positive tests was in the 80s), with the result under our agreement 
being that in 2004 we were about to begin the random testing of individual players 
with disciplinary consequences. I expressed my belief that the 2004 testing program 
would  be  a  significant  deterrent  to  the  use  of  unlawful  performance-enhancing 
drugs, and that the number of positive tests would drop dramatically. I also pointed 
out  that  by  the  end  of  the  season  we  would  have  hard  data  (the  2004  results)  by

which  to  gauge  whether  our  agreement  had  been  effective,  and  whether  my  pre-
diction would prove accurate.

I  recognize  that  not  everything  I  said  that  day  was  well  received.  Chairman 
McCain  said  that  he  did  not  disagree  with  anything  in  my  opening  statement,  but 
nonetheless indicated he thought we needed a much stronger program. Senator Dor-
gan said he was disappointed that we had made so little progress since a Committee 
hearing  in  the  summer  of  2002,  and  indicated  his  dissatisfaction  that  under  our 
2002  agreement,  players  who  tested  positive  for  the  first  time  were  not  suspended 
or  publicly  identified,  but  instead  referred  to  treatment.  Based  on  these  and  other 
criticisms, the Chairman urged us to commit to revisit the issue. We did. 

We  soon  began  discussions  with  the  clubs  to  amend  our  agreement,  even  though 
we had no legal obligation to negotiate, and announced our new agreement last Jan-
uary. In it, we tried to address each of the major criticisms which had been leveled 
at  our  program:  (1)  we  added  additional  tests,  and  established  a  program  under 
which  a  player  could  never  be  certain  that  he  would  not  be  tested  again;  (2)  we 
added  off-season  testing;  and  (3)  we  increased  the  penalties,  including  the  public 
identification and suspension of a player who tested positive for the first time. While 
reluctant  to  take  this  last  step,  the  players  believed  that  public  identification  of 
those  who  test  positive  for  the  use  of  unlawful  performance-enhancing  drugs,  with 
the attendant necessary consequences of widespread criticism and shame, would be 
a significant deterrent. 

On  the  day  of  the  announcement,  Mr.  Selig  praised  both  the  agreement  and  the 
Players  Association  for  agreeing  to  an  unprecedented  mid-term  renegotiation  of  a 
significant provision in our collective bargaining agreement. In early March, he said 
he  was  ‘‘very  confident  that  we  will  effectively  rid  our  sport  of  steroids’’  in  2005. 
President Bush said the new agreement was good for baseball and good for society. 
Some Members of Congress indicated that they hoped that more would be done, but 
still  clearly  felt  that  the  new  agreement  was  a  very  positive  step.  By  all  accounts, 
we had significantly enhanced our program. At about the same time we learned that 
the 2004 program was working well. There were twelve confirmed positive tests, out 
of more than 1,100 administered. 

Both the new agreement we reached and the results in 2004—the hard data—con-
stitute  strong  evidence  of  progress.  And  yet,  only  two  months  after  the  announce-
ment  of  the  new  agreement,  and  before  we  even  were  able  to  implement  it,  we  ap-
peared  on  March  17,  2005,  before  the  House  Committee  on  Government  Reform. 
Again,  our  program  received  harsh  criticism.  I  believed  then,  and  continue  to  be-
lieve, that much of that criticism was not well-founded. 

A  few  weeks  after  the  hearing,  despite  his  previous  emphatic  support  of  the  new 
program,  Commissioner  Selig  publicly  called  for  us  to  renegotiate  yet  again.  Mem-
bers of the House Government Reform Committee, as well as the House Energy and 
Commerce  Committee  which  held  a  hearing  on  May  18,  also  asked  us  to  do  so,  as 
did  Members  of  the  Senate.  And  so,  yet  again,  we  have.  I  informed  the  Commis-
sioner  that  we  would  discuss  the  issues  with  the  players,  and  I  spent  much  of  the 
summer traveling to meet with all of the players on all 30 teams to give each player 
an opportunity to hear and discuss these difficult issues. During and subsequent to 
my  meetings  with  the  players,  we  have  been  actively  negotiating  with  the  clubs  to 
see what additional agreement we may be able to reach. 1 

Meanwhile,  we  now  have  results  from  the  2005  testing  program.  Some  believed 
there  might  be  far  more  positive  test  results  in  2005  than  in  2004  for  one  simple 
reason: many substances which were perfectly legal until last January are now ille-
gal, as a result of the passage of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. The sub-
stances covered in the bill were automatically added to our program. As a practical 
matter,  what  this  meant  was  that  a  player  could  test  positive  this  year  merely  by 
continuing to use something he had legally purchased as recently as New Years Day 
2005.  And,  of  course,  we  have  a  very  diverse  membership,  some  of  whom  live  in 
countries in which I believe some of those products can still be legally obtained. 

Those  concerns  were  not  realized.  The  2005  results  demonstrate  that  the  players 
take  our  program  seriously.  So  far  this  year  we  have  conducted  more  than  1,400 
tests. Only nine players have been suspended for testing positive, of which only five 
were full-time Major Leaguers in 2004, and only four of whom will have a full year 
of  major  league  service  in  2005.  Two  of  the  nine  had  no  Major  League  service 
through 2004; two had less than two months. And one of the nine players suspended 
did not use steroids in 2005 at all. The arbitrator found that the low level detected 

1 Both  sides  agreed  that  it  would  be  unfair  to  implement  new  testing  rules  during  the  2005 
season.  Indeed.  Mr.  Selig  said  he  thought  it  was  unfair  to  do  so  in  the  Minor  Leagues,  where 
the program is unilaterally implemented by the owners. We also believed that the results of our 
2005 testing program would be helpful to our discussions.

in  his  urine  was  the  result  of  a  prior  use,  before  the  2004  season,  for  which  this 
player had already been disciplined twice, under the Minor League program. It was 
for  that  reason  that  the  Players  Association  believed,  and  still  believes,  that  this 
third  suspension  was  fundamentally  unfair  and  inappropriate,  representing  a  kind 
of double jeopardy. 

Clearly these results are very encouraging, and one can hope that the final results 
will  demonstrate  that  Mr.  Selig’s  prediction  (that  we  will  effectively  rid  the  game 
of steroids in 2005) will turn out to be accurate. 2 

Of course, as everyone here is well aware, one of the players suspended does have 
substantial  Major  League  service.  Senator  McCain  has  indicated  that  the  suspen-
sion  of  Rafael  Palmeiro  brought  this  issue  to  the  forefront  again.  To  an  extent,  I 
feel  as  if  we  are  caught  in  a  catch-22.  Before  the  Palmeiro  suspension,  a  primary 
criticism  leveled  at  our  program  had  been  that  it  could  not  be  working  because  no 
well-known  players  had  been  suspended.  After  the  Palmeiro  suspension  we  hear 
that  the  program  cannot  be  working  because  Rafael  Palmeiro  was  found  to  be  in 
violation of the program. But you can’t have it both ways. With all due respect, our 
program is working well. It has resulted in a dramatically reduced incidence of ster-
oid use, and applies to all players equally, without regard to seniority, ability or sta-
tus  in  the  game.  Nor  does  the  Palmeiro  suspension  demonstrate  that  our  penalties 
are  inadequate.  The  consequences  of  making  this  suspension  public  have  been  dev-
astating for the player. 

Let  me  turn  now  to  our  current  discussions  with  the  owners.  Unfortunately,  as 
of  the  time  that  this  is  written,  we  have  not  yet  reached  a  comprehensive  new 
agreement,  and,  in  labor  negotiations,  no  final  agreement  is  made  until  all  out-
standing  issues  have  been  resolved.  But  we  have  made  significant  progress  in  each 
of  the  areas  of  concern  identified  by  Mr.  Selig,  and  have  reached  or  are  very  near 
agreement  on  several  of  the  key  issues  which  we  have  been  discussing.  We  have 
agreed to conduct significantly more tests. The number of tests performed each year 
would  double,  and  the  new  annual  number  of  tests  would  be  approximately  3,000. 
We  have  agreed  upon  a  framework  for  testing  for  amphetamines,  something  that 
baseball  has  never  before  tried  to  do,  and  have  essentially  agreed  on  a  penalty 
structure  for  amphetamine  positives.  We  have  offered  to  move  more  of  our  testing 
and  administrative  functions  to  an  outside  entity  in  order  satisfy  a  criticism—even 
if,  as  we  believe,  it  is  uninformed—that  we  need  to  create  more  transparency  and 
independence.  We  also  have  agreed  to  clarify  the  language  regarding  governmental 
investigations. 

However, we have yet to reach agreement on a new penalty structure to be appli-
cable to players who are found to have used unlawful steroids. Although the Players 
Association  has  made  a  proposal  for  enhanced  penalties,  we  have  been  unable  to 
meet the Commissioner’s demands, particularly with respect to penalties for a first-
time offender. Specifically, the agreement we entered into in January calls for a 10-
day suspension for a first positive. The MLBPA has proposed doubling that to a pre-
sumptive  20-game  suspension.  The  Commissioner  would  have  the  right  to  impose 
a  suspension  which  could  under  certain  circumstances  become  30  games,  and  the 
player  would  be  able  to  argue  that  the  circumstances  were  such  that  the  penalty 
should  be  reduced  (but  not  below  10  games).  Mr.  Selig’s  proposal  presumes  a  50-
game  penalty,  with  the  possibility  that  he  could  increase  it  to  60  games,  and  the 
player  could  argue  that  it  should  be  reduced  to  40.  For  a  second  violation,  the  cur-
rent  agreement  calls  for  a  30-day  suspension.  The  MLBPA  has  proposed  that  this 
be increased to a presumptive 75-game suspension, with circumstances under which 
the Commissioner could impose 100 games, and the player having the right to argue 
to  an  arbitrator  for  a  reduced  penalty,  but  at  least  50  games.  Mr.  Selig’s  proposed 
presumptive penalty is 100 games, although he could impose up to 120 games, and 
the player could argue for a lower penalty of 80 games. And for a third positive test 
result, the current agreement calls for a 60-day suspension. We have proposed that 
the new agreement give the Commissioner the right to impose whatever suspension 
he  believes  is  appropriate  and  consistent  with  just  cause,  including  a  permanent 
ban,  with  the  player  having  the  right  to  argue  to  an  arbitrator  that  the  penalty  is 
not warranted under the facts of his particular case. Mr. Selig’s position is that after 
a  third  violation,  a  player  should  be  permanently  banned,  without  arbitral  review 
or  any  other  review,  or  even  an  examination  of  the  particular  facts  and  cir-
cumstances of the individual case. 

The  clubs’  position  in  this  bargaining  seems  to  be  that  the  players  must  give  the 
clubs what they want or an even more punitive result will follow by legislation. But, 

2 The  incidence  of  positive  test  results  is  at  a  very  low  level,  and  while  zero  is  our  goal,  it 
may  be  unrealistic  to  expect  that  it  will  be  reached.  No  testing  program  has  been  entirely  free 
of positive tests. But we are already very close to that goal.

clearly, Mr. Selig does not believe that stiffer penalties are needed in order to have 
an  effective  program.  He  has  said  on  a  number  of  occasions  that  the  program  is  in 
fact working well, but that, somehow, this is not the issue and that does not matter. 
We  think  it  does  matter.  We  think  that  the  facts  do  matter,  or  they  should.  It 
is  the  very  role  and  function  of  the  Players  Association,  as  it  is  of  every  union,  to 
effectively represent its members to the best of its ability, and that includes individ-
uals who will be tested and, if appropriate, punished. So we do believe, and we must 
believe,  that  fundamental  fairness  matters,  and  that  the  penalties  should  be  de-
signed  for  effective  deterrence,  not  for  punishment  for  its  own  sake.  The  penalties 
the  clubs  are  asking  for,  and  the  ones  provided  in  the  bills  being  discussed  today, 
do not meet that standard. 

Consider  our  current  program.  While  we  do  not  have  a  system  of  absolute  strict 
liability,  we  have  agreed  that  once  a  player  tests  positive  the  burden  shifts  to  the 
player  to  show  why  he  did  not  violate  the  program.  This  obviously  puts  the  player 
in  the  nearly  impossible  situation  of  having  to  attempt  to  demonstrate  how  some-
thing  got  into  his  body  weeks  or  months  earlier.  If  he  did  not  put  it  there,  he  will 
not  know.  Clearly  there  may  well  be  results  which  are  unfair  to  the  player.  And 
while some will say that a system like this is necessary in order to have an effective 
policy, it is also a reason that first time penalties should not be overly severe—that 
is, more punitive than is necessary to deter use. 

There is also the possibility that a player will test positive as the result of a mis-
take.  The  player  may  take  a  single  pill,  not  knowing  what  it  is  or  thinking  it  is 
something  else,  and  test  positive.  And,  however  unlikely  we  hope  that  it  is,  there 
certainly is also the possibility of a player being set up by someone who puts some-
thing in his food or beverage. A Major League player is not in a position to do what 
I have heard some cyclists do, i.e., take everything he is going to consume with him 
whenever  he  travels.  And  there  is  also  the  question  of  the  science,  and  its  limita-
tions.  We  may  be  using  the  best  science  available  but,  it  will  likely  evolve.  For  ex-
ample,  we  know  things  now  that  we  did  not  know  until  very  recently.  It  used  to 
be thought that the metabolites of nandrolone were not naturally found in humans; 
now we know that in certain circumstances they can be. We also did not know that 
the  metabolites  could  grow  in  a  test  tube;  now  we  know  otherwise.  As  time  goes 
on  we  will  likely  learn  other  things  of  which  we  are  not  now  aware.  Scientific  mis-
takes will be made, and a just program must account for that reality. 

If  this  Committee  does  proceed  to  consider  legislation,  be  it  one  of  the  bills  cur-
rently  before  it  or  one  of  the  measures  under  consideration  in  the  House  of  Rep-
resentatives,  we  ask  that  it  address  several  issues  which  to  date  have  not  received 
serious  attention.  This  is  especially  true  since  different  legal  and  regulatory  con-
cerns arise when a testing program is mandated by the Federal Government as op-
posed  to  one  created  and  administered  through  collective  bargaining.  For  example, 
what  is  the  basis  for  covering  some  professional  athletes  and  not  others?  Will  cov-
ered  athletes  be  afforded  traditional  due  process  rights?  Will  covered  athletes  be 
provided the same legal protections and due process rights afforded Federal employ-
ees who are subject to random, suspicionless testing? What is the appropriate stand-
ard  to  judge  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  an  existing  penalty  structure?  What 
is  the  mechanism  for  redressing  the  injuries  suffered  by  a  professional  athlete  who 
is  incorrectly  identified  as  testing  positive?  What  scientific  standards  will  be  fol-
lowed concerning the development and implementation of new testing methodologies 
or replacing those found to be out-dated or inaccurate? And, how will the Committee 
ensure a proposed program is Constitutional? 

There are serious questions as to whether the bills before the Committee are con-
sistent  with  the  Constitution.  See,  for  example,  Chandler  v.  Miller,  520  U.S.  305 
(1997).  In  that  case  the  Supreme  Court  held  unconstitutional,  as  a  violation  of  the 
Fourth  Amendment,  a  Georgia  law  requiring  drug  testing  of  candidates  for  public 
office.  The  Federal  Government  recognized  the  principles  set  forth  in  Chandler  in 
1999  when  it  clarified  which  Federal  employees  could  be  subjected  to  mandatory 
random drug testing. Concerns regarding public safety or national security can jus-
tify such testing, the Fourth Amendment notwithstanding. Concerns regarding pub-
lic trust, reputation for integrity, honesty or responsibility, cannot. 3 

Clearly,  the  considerations  which  might  or  might  not  justify  federally  mandated 
testing  of  professional  athletes  may  be  different  than  those  which  pertain  to  State 
or  Federal  officials  or  employees,  and  no  one  can  be  certain  what  the  result  of  any 
litigation would be. But given the doubt that any such legislation would be Constitu-
tionally  valid,  along  with  the  evidence  that  the  agreement  reached  by  the  parties

in  collective  bargaining  is  successfully  dealing  with  the  problem,  legislation  at  this 
time is not warranted. Under the circumstances, the bargaining parties have a pro-
gram  whose  effectiveness  should  at  the  very  least  be  tested  over  time  before  Con-
gress wrests control of this issue from private hands. 

As  I  said,  we  have  not  yet  reached  final  agreement  with  the  clubs  on  a  new  pro-
gram,  but  we  have  on  a  number  of  important  issues.  Hopefully  we  will  be  able  to 
close on the remaining issues.

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you very much. 
Welcome, Commissioner Tagliabue. 

STATEMENT OF PAUL TAGLIABUE, COMMISSIONER, NATIONAL 

FOOTBALL LEAGUE 

Commissioner TAGLIABUE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, 
Senator  Bunning  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  The  issues  that 
the Committee is considering today are very important and clearly 
merit  the  attention  of  Congress.  Mr.  Upshaw  and  I  last  appeared 
before this Committee some 18 months ago, we’ve again submitted 
a  joint  statement  because  while  there  are  issues  on  which  we  dis-
agree  in  other  areas,  at  times  quite  sharply,  this  is  not  one  of 
them. 

We  currently  have  strong  and  effective  programs  in  place  to  rid 
our  locker  rooms  and  playing  fields  of  performance-enhancing 
drugs.  These  policies  were  put  in  place  as  long  as  18  or  20  years 
ago.  We  have  worked  since  then  with  leading  institutions  and  sci-
entists,  both  in  and  out  of  government  and  continue  to  do  so  to 
have  very  strong  programs  and  policies  to  deal  with  these  issues. 
We recognize that one of the Committee’s critical concerns is the 
extent  of  steroid  and  other  substance  abuse,  or  use  among  young 
people. We have been working with topnotch universities and med-
ical  organizations  to  create  materials  distributed  on  the  Internet 
and elsewhere for some years to discourage the use of steroids, sup-
plements  and  other  drugs  of  abuse  by  young  people.  We  have 
shared  with  the  Committee  our  ‘‘Play  Safe’’  medical  series,  our 
Coaching  Academy  publications  and  now  in  conjunction  with  the 
National Institute of Drug Abuse, we are airing anti-steroid adver-
tisements on all of our network telecasts, on other programming of 
our network partners and on our own NFL Network. 

I’ve  been  involved  with  youth  sports  my  entire  life.  I  was  fortu-
nate  enough  to  go  to  college  on  an  athletic  scholarship,  basketball 
to  be  specific.  I  wouldn’t  be  here  today,  I  wouldn’t  have  the  edu-
cation  I  had  if  I  hadn’t  been  inspired  by  my  heroes  in  basketball, 
football, baseball, hockey, track and field and other areas. So I fully 
support—and we fully support as you know, Mr. Upshaw has been 
involved  in  sports  his  whole  life,  and  he’s  more  successful  than  I, 
but we both strongly support what the Committee is doing. 

I  could  comment  on  specific  aspects  of  the  bills,  but  I  think  our 
policies  are  in  sync  with  all  of  the  critical  elements  of  the  bills. 
Both  bills  call  for  random  testing  throughout  the  year;  we  have 
that.  Both  bills  call  for  a  comprehensive  list  of  banned  substances 
and  methods;  we  have  that.  Both  bills  call  for  independent  admin-
istration of a testing program; under our program as you know, Mr. 
Chairman,  no  representative  of  the  League,  the  Players  Associa-
tion,  or  any  NFL  member  team  has  any  role  whatsoever  in  deter-
mining  who  will  be  tested,  when  a  player  will  be  tested,  or  how 
often  he  will  be  tested.  It’s  all  institutionalized  with  outside  par-

ties, and in large measure computerized and randomized with com-
puter technology. 

Both bills require the use of an independent certified laboratory, 
we  do  that.  And  we  have  funded  those  laboratories  and  are  con-
tinuing to fund new laboratories in this field. 

Both bills call for tough sanctions for violators. Our program em-
bodies  a  strict  liability  approach  under  which  players  are  strictly 
responsible  for  whatever  is  in  their  bodies  that’s  a  violation,  and 
suspensions without pay are mandatory for all offenders. 

We strongly believe in the strict liability approach rather than a 
subjective  intent  approach.  Consistent  with  the  strict  liability  ap-
proach  a  four-game  suspension,  25  percent  of  the  season  without 
pay  is  an  effective  sanction  for  a  first  offense.  We  have  had  in  the 
almost 20 years of our program only two repeat offenders, and both 
of those players retired from the game before they were suspended 
a second time. 

I believe this is a very telling measure of the effectiveness of both 

our testing and our discipline. 

In  our  prepared  statement  we  emphasize  that  we  fully  respect 
Congress’  desire  and  prerogative  to  legislate,  and  we  would  urge 
that that legislation have a certification program that would recog-
nize  in  advance  the  effectiveness  of  collective  bargaining  programs 
that serve and meet the policies and goals of the statute. And that 
there  would  be—that  is  a  feature  that  is  in  some  other  areas  of 
Federal law so that we can know in advance that what we’re doing 
complies with the Congressional mandate. 

I’ll be pleased to take questions, as will Mr. Upshaw, Mr. Chair-

man, and we thank you again for your focus on this issue. 

[The joint prepared statement of Mr. Tagliabue and Mr. Upshaw 

follows:]

JOINT PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL TAGLIABUE,  COMMISSIONER,  NATIONAL
FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND EUGENE UPSHAW,  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,  NFL  PLAYERS 
ASSOCIATION 
Chairman Stevens, Chairman McCain, and Members of the Committee: 
The issue that the Committee is considering today—the use of steroids and other 
performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports—is an important one that mer-
its thoughtful attention by the Congress. It is an issue that addresses a wide range 
of  concerns:  the  health  of  athletes  who  use  these  substances,  the  values  that  are 
promoted or debased by the use of these substances, and the proper roles of govern-
ment and the private sector in combating their use. 

In recent months this subject has commanded considerable time and attention in 
both Houses of Congress. It also has for us, but it is not a new subject in the NFL. 
For two decades, we have had very strong programs in place to rid our locker rooms 
and playing fields of performance-enhancing drugs, and League programs have been 
a positive force in helping football at all levels to address these issues. We have not 
had  all  the  answers  but  we  have  worked  with  leading  institutions  and  scientists, 
both  in  and  out  of  government,  to  stay  ahead  of  an  ever-changing  curve.  Our  poli-
cies,  which  have  included  prompt  and  stiff  sanctions  for  violators,  have  addressed 
these issues in a firm and constructive way. And we intend to continue to have very 
strong  policies  and  programs  to  deal  with  the  scientific,  medical,  ethical  and  legal 
questions surrounding the use of these substances both within and outside of profes-
sional sports. 

We  last  appeared  before  this  Committee  on  this  subject  some  18  months  ago. 
Then,  as  today,  we  submitted  a  joint  statement.  We  do  so  because  while  there  are 
issues on which we disagree—at times sharply—this is not one of them. 

We  have  previously  furnished  to  the  Committee  detailed  information  about  the 

structure and operation of our program, how it works, and the results to date.

To summarize, more than 20 years ago, in 1983, Commissioner Pete Rozelle noti-
fied all NFL players that anabolic steroids fell squarely within the League’s prohibi-
tion  against  drug  abuse  and  that  steroids  had  serious  adverse  health  effects.  In 
1987 and 1988, the League began testing for steroids to obtain a documented under-
standing of the extent of steroid use among NFL players. And in 1989, the NFL in-
stituted  discipline  for  steroid  use  with  suspensions  on  players  testing  positive  for 
prohibited  substances.  In  testimony  given  in  May  of  1989  to  the  Senate  Judiciary 
Committee, Commissioner Rozelle outlined the basis for the League’s more stringent 
approach:

‘‘The  fundamental  responsibility  of  [the  Commissioner]  is  to  protect,  as  best  he 
can,  the  integrity  of  the  game  he  oversees  and  the  public’s  confidence  in  it.  In 
my  view,  steroid  use  both  threatens  that  integrity  and  confidence  and  presents 
other significant problems as well.
‘‘Our  measures  are  designed  to  promote  common  sense,  fair  play,  and  good 
health.  If  they  do  no  more  than  generate  an  increased  awareness  among  ath-
letes at all levels of the potential risks of using steroids, our program will have 
been  a  modest  success . . . . [But]  we  hope  our  new  measures  will  be  a  much 
larger  success  and  a  significant  step  toward  eradicating  these  drugs  from  our 
sport.’’

Shortly after taking office in late 1989, Commissioner Tagliabue instituted a num-
ber  of  changes  in  the  League’s  program,  to  take  account  of  the  need  for  greater  in-
vestment  in  specialized  resources  and  increasingly  varied  and  sophisticated  testing 
techniques to deal with a growing array of substances. Those changes included year-
round random, unannounced testing for all players, new medical and scientific advi-
sors,  and  moving  all  testing  to  laboratories  certified  by  the  International  Olympic 
Committee.  Since  1993,  we  have  had  a  jointly  administered  program  by  the  NFL 
and  NFL  Players  Association.  And  the  League  and  the  NFLPA  have  met  regularly 
to  review  the  workings  of  the  program  and  to  ensure  that  we  are  continuing  to  be 
pro-active  in  responding  to  developments  of  science  and  technology,  doping  control 
research, and the policies of other organizations. For many years, we were the only 
professional  league  that  tested  for  these  substances  and  imposed  significant  dis-
cipline  for  a  positive  test.  And  our  program,  while  not  perfect,  has  worked  and 
worked well. 

In this respect, it is important to understand what a four-game suspension means 
in the NFL. It takes the player entirely out of the lineup for one quarter of our sea-
son.  In  other  leagues,  this  would  be  the  equivalent  of  a  20  or  40  game  suspension. 
If  the  suspension  begins  late  in  the  season,  it  will  carry  into  the  playoffs.  Any  sus-
pended  player  likewise  loses  a  quarter  of  his  regular  season  salary  and  may  also 
forfeit some or all of his signing or performance bonus. By any measure, it is a sig-
nificant penalty, but not a vindictive one. 

It is against this background that we offer comments on S. 1114 and S. 1334, the 
two  bills  presently  pending  before  the  Committee.  We  fully  endorse  the  goals  of 
these  bills.  In  many  respects,  the  principal  points  set  forth  in  the  bills  have  long 
been part of our own program.

• Both  bills  call  for  random  testing  of  athletes  throughout  the  year.  Our  program 
has relied on this kind of random, unannounced testing for more than 15 years. 
We  currently  conduct  more  than  9,000  unscheduled  tests  every  year  on  NFL 
players, which occur throughout the season, during the playoffs, and during our 
off-season.  Every  player  is  tested,  but  no  player  knows  when  or  how  often  he 
will  be  tested.  Earlier  this  year,  we  increased  by  a  factor  of  three  the  number 
of  off-season  tests  to  which  a  player  is  subject—at  a  time  when  the  Olympic 
drug  testing  authority  cut  in  half  the  number  of  off-season,  or  out-of-competi-
tion, tests that it performed.
• Both  bills  call  for  a  comprehensive  list  of  banned  substances  and  doping  meth-
ods. While our list of prohibited substances and methods may differ in some re-
spects  from  the  Olympic  list,  there  can  be  no  serious  question  that  our  list  is 
broad  and  comprehensive.  It  is  reviewed  every  year  and  frequently  supple-
mented. We have banned substances like androstenedione, DHEA, and ephedra 
well  before  other  sports  or  even  the  Federal  Government  did  so.  Indeed,  when 
we  appeared  before  this  Committee  last  year  it  was  to  testify  in  support  of  a 
bill that would prohibit the use of certain steroids and steroid precursors—each 
of which had already been banned in the NFL through our collective bargaining 
process.
• Both  bills  call  for  independent  administration  of  the  testing  program.  The  ran-
dom selection of players to be tested in the NFL is supervised by a medical ad-
visor  retained  jointly  by  the  NFL  and  NFLPA,  Dr.  John  Lombardo,  who  is  a 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  14:47 Aug 16, 2006 Jkt 028683 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\28683.TXT JACKF PsN: JACKF

25

recognized  expert  in  this  field.  Dr.  Lombardo  uses  a  computer-based  selection 
system  specially  designed  for  this  purpose.  Administration  of  the  testing  pro-
gram  is  independent.  No  representative  of  the  NFL,  the  NFLPA,  or  any  NFL 
member  club  has  any  role  whatsoever  in  determining  who  will  be  tested,  when 
a particular player will be tested, or how often he will be tested.
• Both  bills  require  that  a  testing  program  use  an  independent,  certified  labora-
tory.  Our  program  has  always  complied  with  this  requirement.  All  of  our  tests 
are performed at the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, which fully satisfies 
any  standard  of  independence  and  expertise.  And  we  have  partnered  with  the 
U.S.  Anti-Doping  Agency  to  finance  and  develop  a  second  certified  lab  to  per-
form  testing  and  research  on  steroids  and  other  substances.  This  new  lab  will 
be based at the University of Utah and is expected to begin operations later this 
year.
• Both  bills  call  for  tough  sanctions  for  violators.  Our  program  embodies  a  strict 
liability  approach,  with  mandatory  suspensions  for  first  offenders.  Our  sanc-
tions  are  clear,  significant  and  effective.  And,  consistent  with  both  bills,  we 
have from the beginning included a collectively-bargained appeal process.

In short, our current program satisfies all of the key requirements of the two bills 
pending before the Committee. We also incorporate one more significant feature that 
makes  our  collectively-bargained  program  superior  to  a  government  program—the 
ability  to  respond  quickly  to  changes  in  substance  use  for  doping  technology.  For 
example,  when  the  designer  steroid  THG  was  identified  in  2003,  we  retested  more 
than 2,000 urine samples—every sample in our possession—to determine the extent 
to which NFL players may have used this drug. And our policy has from the outset 
incorporated  a  ‘‘related  substances’’  provision,  to  ensure  that  minor  chemical 
changes do not allow users to escape the prohibitions of our program. 

This process of continual examination and improvement has continued into 2005. 
Before  hearings  began  in  the  current  session,  the  NFL  and  NFLPA  agreed  as  part 
of the regular review of the program to implement the following improvements:

during the off-season.

• To  reduce  the  threshold  for  a  positive  testosterone  test  from  the  previous  6:1 
testosterone-epitestosterone  ratio  to  a  ratio  of  4:1.  This  is  the  same  standard 
used for Olympic tests.
• To increase from two to six the maximum number of times players can be tested 
• To add additional substances to the list of banned substances.
The development and operation of this program, and our common commitment to 
continual examination and improvement, has never required a prod from Congress. 
Rather,  it  reflects  our  shared  commitment  to  protecting  the  integrity  of  our  game, 
preserving the health of our players, and promoting proper values among young peo-
ple. 

Where  we  differ  from  the  pending  bills  is  in  our  belief  that  a  Federally-imposed 
solution is not required in all cases. To the contrary, we believe that the government 
should  recognize  and  encourage  private  sector  solutions  through  collective  bar-
gaining, and that those solutions are preferable, particularly where—as here—there 
is  a  substantial  track  record  of  effectiveness.  Accordingly,  we  do  not  believe  either 
of these bills should be enacted into law without providing for a certification mecha-
nism  that  permits  the  continued  operation  of  collectively-bargained  programs  that 
meet Congressional policy goals. 

Our specific concerns are as follows: 
First, we do not believe there is any demonstrated basis for supplanting in all cir-
cumstances  collective  bargaining  as  the  appropriate  means  for  addressing  these 
issues.  Instead,  we  believe  that  any  bill  should  expressly  recognize  collectively-bar-
gained  solutions  and  provide  that  effective  collectively-bargained  programs  satisfy 
the requirements of the statute. 

This  is  not  a  new  concept.  On  numerous  occasions,  Congress  has  specifically  rec-
ognized  the  wisdom  of  deferring  to  solutions  reached  by  management  and  labor  in 
collective bargaining, and has provided for specific exemptions from otherwise-appli-
cable  Federal  law.  These  examples  include  the  treatment  of  collectively-bargained 
employee benefit plans, overtime and severance pay, use of immigrant workers, and 
grievance procedures. In each of these and other cases, generally-applicable Federal 
law  has  given  way  to  the  terms  of  a  collective  bargaining  agreement.  And  we  have 
substantial  concerns  about  a  regulatory  approach  displacing  and  potentially  weak-
ening a demonstrably effective program. 

Finally,  a  collectively-bargained  approach  will  have  greater  player  acceptance 

than would be the case with a government-imposed solution.

Second, a uniform system for all sports may actually lower standards in the NFL 
and  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  our  program.  One  obvious  example  is  the  in-season/
out-of-season  distinction  that  is  drawn  in  the  bills.  This  concept,  which  is  found  in 
the  Olympic  anti-doping  code,  may  be  appropriate  in  Olympic  sports,  which  are  al-
most  entirely  individual,  and  where  the  competition  is  largely  limited  to  a  number 
of  high  profile  events  over  a  two-to-four  year  period.  In  the  NFL,  that  distinction 
has  no  place  and  would  weaken  our  program  in  a  significant  way.  Rather,  we  be-
lieve that there should be one set of rules that applies throughout the year. The in-
season/out-of-season  distinction  would  needlessly  confuse  players,  send  mixed  mes-
sages  to  young  people,  and  create  significant  and  unnecessary  administrative  com-
plexities in the program. 

Another  problem  with  a  uniform  regulatory  regime  is  that  it  will  be  slower  and 
more cumbersome than our collectively bargained approach, which allows for a more 
rapid  and  certain  response  to  developments  in  doping  and  anti-doping  technology. 
As  one  example,  in  1997,  the  NFL  and  NFLPA  agreed  to  include  androstenedione 
as  a  banned  substance.  Players  testing  positive  for  andro  were  suspended.  Had  we 
been required to wait for the FTC, or for the Director of the Office of National Drug 
Control  Policy  to  make  this  determination,  NFL  players  might  have  continued  to 
use andro without penalty. 

In addition, and unlike a government program, our program is not subject to col-
lateral court challenges. The example of ephedra is instructive here. We determined 
that ephedra should be a prohibited substance at the beginning of the 2001 season. 
The  FDA  eventually  implemented  a  ban  on  ephedra  in  2004,  but  its  rules  were 
sharply  limited  by  a  Federal  judge’s  decision  earlier  this  year.  By  contrast,  agree-
ments between the NFL and the NFLPA are not subject to these kinds of court chal-
lenges since the National Labor Relations Act requires courts to give great deference 
to these kinds of employer-employee agreements. 

Regulations  issued  by  a  government  body  are,  by  nature  of  the  notice  and  com-
ment and judicial review provisions in the Administrative Procedure Act, necessarily 
subject  to  lengthy  administrative  procedures,  court  challenges,  and  potential  revi-
sion  or  invalidation  by  a  single  Federal  judge.  And  once  Congress  federalizes  drug 
testing in sports, and replaces collective bargaining under the National Labor Rela-
tions  Act  with  statutory  and  regulatory  mandates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that 
even agreed-upon provisions that exceed Federal minimums will be respected by the 
courts.  Nor  would  the  anti-injunction  provisions  of  the  Norris-LaGuardia  Act  nec-
essarily continue to apply. 

Third, the penalties required by the bills are excessive and disproportionate in the 
context  of  professional  football.  There  is  no  evidence  that  current  penalties  in  the 
NFL  are  too  low,  insufficient  to  deter  use,  or  somehow  perceived  as  insubstantial 
or  not  credible  by  players,  teams  and  fans.  From  any  perspective—financial,  com-
petitive,  and  reputational—a  mandatory  four  game  suspension  without  pay,  com-
bined with ongoing testing, is a substantial penalty that works. 

The central feature of penalties in the NFL system is that of strict liability. Play-
ers  are  told  and  clearly  understand  that  they  are  responsible  for  what  is  in  their 
bodies. There are no issues of inadvertent use or tainted supplements. Questions of 
intent  are  simply  not  relevant.  Long  experience  confirms  that  it  is  difficult  if  not 
impossible  to  administer  the  sort  of  intent-based  system  embodied  in  the  proposed 
legislation. 

The strict liability standard that we have agreed to serves a number of important 
purposes. It provides clarity for athletes, teams and fans. It is a simple and straight-
forward principle that places the responsibility where it belongs—on the player. 

It  also  promotes  fairness  and  even-handedness.  All  players  are  subject  to  the 
same rules and procedures, and players know that they will all be treated the same 
way  under  the  program.  Finally,  the  strict  liability  standard  promotes  efficient  ad-
ministration of the appeal process. Hearing officers do not have discretion to reduce 
the penalty. If the positive test is confirmed, the discipline follows automatically. 

We  believe  our  current  system  of  limited  suspensions  and  strict  liability  is  pref-
erable  to  a  system  of  much  longer  suspensions  combined  with  a  series  of  intent-
based reductions or exemptions. 

One  important  measure  of  whether  a  penalty  structure  is  effective  is  the  extent  to 
which  there  are  repeat  offenders.  In  the  NFL,  there  have  only  been  two  repeat 
positives  in  15  years,  both  of  whom  retired  from  the  game  rather  than  face  a  longer 
suspension. And the low number of repeat offenders is not because we were looking 
the other way. NFL players who test positive are tested as often as 24 times a year 
for  the  rest  of  their  career,  meaning  that  there  is  very  little  prospect  of  escaping 
detection. 

Two  other  matters  related  to  the  scope  and  effectiveness  of  the  League’s  testing 

programs also deserve mention.

27

The  first  is  the  subject  of  human  growth  hormone  (‘‘HGH’’).  We  have  prohibited 
this  substance  since  1991.  Currently,  there  is  no  readily  available  test  or  testing 
laboratory  in  the  United  States  for  HGH,  and  there  is  still  no  urine-based  test  for 
growth  hormone.  A  blood  test  was  first  used  at  last  summer’s  Olympic  games  in 
Athens,  where  300  of  the  more  than  11,000  athletes  who  competed  in  the  Games 
were  tested.  No  athlete  tested  positive.  We  are  currently  evaluating  our  next  steps 
with  respect  to  growth  hormone  and  will  continue  to  consult  with  experts  in  the 
field, including those associated with government and other leading sports organiza-
tions.  When  scientific  developments  warrant,  we  will  act  quickly  to  adjust  our  own 
policies as we have consistently done in the past. 

The second is testosterone, which we are addressing in two respects. First, to take 
account  of  the  evolving  consensus  as  to  test  protocols  for  the  testosterone-
epitestosterone ratio, we have lowered the threshold for a positive test from a ratio 
of 6:1 to a ratio of 4:1. Second, we have developed procedures to review player tests 
over time to identify unusual changes in player t:e ratios, even when below the 4:1 
threshold,  which  would  then  result  in  more  detailed  medical  review,  reasonable 
cause testing, and discipline. 

We recognize that one of the Committee’s primary concerns is the extent to which 
young  people  are  using  steroids  today.  As  Commissioner  Rozelle’s  remarks  to  the 
Senate Judiciary Committee more than 15 years ago demonstrate, this has been one 
of the primary factors underlying the NFL’s program as well. 

Among  athletes  and  coaches,  where  we  can  influence  behavior,  we  make  an  ag-
gressive  effort  to  discourage  the  use  of  steroids,  supplements  and  drugs  of  abuse. 
As  one  example  of  this,  we  have  worked  with  leading  institutions  in  medicine  and 
sports  to  create  reliable  guides  on  fitness,  nutrition,  safety  and  conditioning—enti-
tled  the  ‘‘Play  Safe!  The  NFL  Youth  Football  Health  and  Safety  Series.’’  This  four-
volume series gives players, coaches, parents and the public general information on 
football-specific  health  and  safety  issues  in  a  clear,  easy-to-understand  format. 
Needless to say, this series emphasizes that the use of performance-enhancing sub-
stances, and/or other drugs of abuse, is unacceptable. 

By  partnering  in  the  publication  of  this  series  with  leading  academic  and  public 
service organizations, we have sought to ensure that this series will be regarded as 
definitive  and  independent  and  also  widely  distributed  and  used.  The  series  editor 
is  the  Director  of  Sports  Medicine  at  Yale  University  Health  Services  and  Clinical 
Professor  of  Pediatrics  at  Yale  University  School  of  Medicine,  Dr.  Barry  Goldberg. 
The series is produced in partnership with the American College of Sports Medicine, 
the American Red Cross, the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, and the Insti-
tute for the Study of Youth Sports at Michigan State University. 

Two  of  the  four  volumes  of  this  series  deal  with  the  matters  of  direct  interest  to 
this Committee. One volume specifically discusses ‘‘Strength and Conditioning’’ and 
offers practical, step-by-step techniques to build strength, endurance and flexibility; 
improve performance; and decrease risk of injury—all without steroids or other ille-
gal  substances.  Another  volume  in  the  series,  entitled  ‘‘Health  Concerns  for  Young 
Athletes’’ includes an entire section on substance abuse and specific warnings about 
steroids, including the following:

‘‘There  should  not  be  any  controversy  about  steroid  use  in  sports;  nonmedical 
use is illegal and banned by most, if not all, major sports organizations.’’
‘‘The use of anabolic-androgenic steroids to enhance performance is not only ille-
gal, it is dangerous.’’

This series has been distributed nationwide in both print and on-line editions and 
has  been  furnished  to  the  Committee.  It  has  been  furnished  to  all  high  school  foot-
ball  programs,  and  to  our  NFL  National  Youth  Football  Partners  network,  which 
includes the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Jewish Community Centers Associa-
tion, Police Athletic Leagues, Pop Warner, and the YMCA, among others. The entire 
series is available free of charge on NFLHS.com, a high school football website pre-
sented  by  the  NFL.  The  site  also  includes  articles  and  Q&A  sessions  between  a 
former  NFL  coach  and  high  school  players  on  various  topics,  including  the  dangers 
of steroids and drug use. Among these messages: ‘‘Coaches: Please Know What Your 
Athlete  is  Taking.’’  NFL  representatives  and  other  professionals  also  address  these 
issues  at  our  annual  NFL  Youth  Football  Summit,  and  high  school  and  youth  foot-
ball  coaches  throughout  the  country  receive  our  NFL  Coaching  Academy  Playbook. 
This  publication  includes  a  chapter  devoted  to  health  and  safety  issues  that  gives 
specific  advice  to  football  coaches  on  the  dangers  of  steroids  and  steps  coaches  can 
take  to  detect  and  deter  drug  use  by  their  players.  This,  too,  has  been  furnished 
to the Committee. 

USA  Football,  a  not-for-profit  advocacy  and  educational  organization  jointly  en-
dowed  by  the  NFL  and  the  NFLPA,  has  made  a  wide  array  of  resources  available

to  parents,  coaches  and  players  across  the  Nation.  The  USA  Football  website  con-
tains  articles  on  steroids  and  drugs  of  abuse,  and  USA  Football  made  this  a  key 
focus of its health and safety efforts for 2005, including at its Huddle 2005 national 
conference  last  June.  The  message  is  always  the  same—to  play  football  in  a  way 
that  is  safe,  within  the  rules,  and  without  use  of  artificial  performance-enhancing 
products. 

In conjunction with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, we have also produced 
a series of ‘‘anti-steroids’’ public service announcements, which are being shown dur-
ing telecasts of NFL games throughout the season. 

In  sum,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  support  the  goals  of  the  legislation.  Our  record  over 
the last 15 years makes that clear. We will continue to work closely with each other, 
with  this  Committee,  and  with  those  outside  of  the  NFL  to  keep  our  game  as  free 
of  performance-enhancing  substances  as  we  can.  Our  challenge  going  forward  will 
be  to  ensure  that  our  research  is  current,  that  adequate  resources  are  available  to 
support  programs  proven  to  be  effective  with  young  people,  including  non-athletes, 
and  that  football  organizations  maintain  their  commitment  to  clean  competition  at 
all levels. We recognize that there are significant challenges ahead and we are pre-
pared  to  do  our  part  to  meet  them,  along  with  you  and  this  Committee  and  others 
in Congress who are concerned about this issue. 

Thank  you  for  inviting  us  to  appear  today  and  we  will  be  pleased  to  answer  any 

questions.

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you very much, Commissioner. 
Welcome back, Mr. Upshaw. 

STATEMENT OF GENE UPSHAW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 
NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION 

Mr. UPSHAW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I join with the Commis-
sioner,  and  we  submitted  a  joint  statement,  simply  to  emphasize 
how  strongly  we  feel  about  this.  And  why  there  is  really  no  dis-
agreement  whatsoever  when  it  comes  to  this  issue  of  steroids  and 
performance-enhancing drugs. 

I would only like to add a couple of points to the Commissioner’s 
statement and that is, the players in the National Football League 
strongly endorse this program, support this program, and continue 
to  believe  that  this  program  has  been  effective  as  it  relates  to  the 
National  Football  League.  We  looked  at  the  legislation,  and  when 
we see one-size-fits-all we see that the legislation should really ad-
dress  each  individual  sport,  but  also  allowing  the  collective  bar-
gaining  process  to  come  up  with  a  solution  that  works.  If  it  meets 
with  what  Congress  has,  as  the  Commissioner  stated,  we  think 
we’re  doing  a  very  good  job  in  the  National  Football  League.  We 
have  stayed  on  the  cutting  edge  of  change  and  changed  our  pro-
gram.  We  do  not  wait  for  anyone  else  to  act.  We  want  it  off  the 
field  because  our  players  believe  that  anyone  that  uses  drugs  are 
really cheaters. There is no room for cheaters in sports. And it also 
affects  the  integrity  of  the  game  and  integrity  of  the  contest.  We 
do  not  want  cheaters  in  our  sport,  and  will  do  whatever  we  have 
to do to keep it out. We have had unanimous support from players 
on  this  issue.  Anytime  that  a  player  has  tested  positive,  you  can’t 
find  one  player  in  the  National  Football  League,  and  I’ll  challenge 
you to do that, that supports having a cheater in the sport. 

I  will  be  welcome  and  here  to  answer  any  questions  that  you 

might have. Thank you. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, sir. 
Welcome, Commissioner Stern.

STATEMENT OF DAVID J. STERN, COMMISSIONER, NATIONAL 

BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION 

29

Commissioner STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and other Mem-
bers of the Committee for focusing on this very important problem. 
I  appeared  before  two  different  House  committees,  with  my  coun-
terpart  from  our  Players  Association  in  May,  and  we  represented 
to  them  that  we  were  in  the  midst  of  collective  bargaining  and  al-
though  we  didn’t  know,  didn’t  think,  and  our  knowledge  was  that 
this  was  not  a  major  problem,  we  understood  our  obligation  as  a 
sport  that  had  role  models.  Out  of  that  collective  bargaining,  and 
really the least contentious part of it, came an agreement that may 
sound—begin  to  sound—familiar  to  you,  that  has  four  random  un-
announced  tests,  that  has  an  expanded  list  of  prohibited  sub-
stances, all of those that were declared illegal by Congress, plus ad-
ditional  ones  that  the  World  Anti-Doping  Association  has  put  on 
the  list.  We  clearly  decided  that  it  was  better  and  more  effective 
to turn this over to a third party so that the League and the Play-
ers  Association  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  randomized  unan-
nounced  tests  and  of  course  the  results  will  be  provided  by  a 
WADA  approved  laboratory  and  they  will  be  announced,  with  re-
spect to the player and the drug, if there are any positive tests. 

Our penalties were moved up to 10 games, 25 games, a year and 
you’re  out.  We  think  that  the  strict  liability  that  we  impose  actu-
ally is stricter than the liability under WADA, which allows for ap-
peals and other delays and omission of penalty. And we think that 
collective  bargaining  has  been  effective  for  us.  If  you  nevertheless 
find  it  necessary  to  legislate  in  this  area,  my  statement  which  I 
submit  for  the  record  lists  some  areas  that  we  think  could  bear 
some  additional  focus,  and  we  look  forward  to  either  your  accept-
ance of the collective bargaining process, or such legislation as you 
care to propose. And we think that your focus on this has been very 
helpful  to  us,  as  has  the  House’s  focus  on  this.  And  we  thank  you 
for your attention. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Stern follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID J. STERN, COMMISSIONER, NATIONAL BASKETBALL 

ASSOCIATION 

Chairman  Stevens,  Chairman  McCain  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Com-

mittee: 

On behalf of the National Basketball Association (‘‘NBA’’), I appreciate the oppor-
tunity  to  testify  before  the  Committee  regarding  S.  1114,  the  ‘‘Clean  Sports  Act  of 
2005,’’ and S. 1334, the ‘‘Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act.’’

The NBA supports the efforts of this Committee and the Congress to confront and 
address  the  issue  of  steroids  and  performance-enhancing  substances  in  professional 
sports. These drugs undermine the fundamental integrity of all athletic competition; 
they pose serious health risks to the players involved; and their use in major league 
sports sends a harmful and potentially destructive message to countless young fans 
who  emulate  professional  athletes.  Steroids  and  performance-enhancing  drugs  have 
no place in the NBA. 

The  NBA  has  appeared  before  Congress  twice  this  year  in  connection  with  this 
issue.  On  those  occasions,  we  made  clear  our  intention  to  work  with  the  players’ 
union  during  then-ongoing  collective  bargaining  negotiations  to  strengthen  our  ex-
isting  drug  program.  Those  negotiations  have  now  concluded,  with  the  successful 
execution  of  a  new  labor  contract  in  July  2005.  As  part  of  that  new  contract,  the 
NBA  and  the  Players  Association  did  in  fact  agree  to  substantially  strengthen  and 
expand our drug program, particularly with respect to steroids and performance-en-
hancing substances. 

Important elements of this program now include the following:

• All  players  (veterans  and  rookies)  will  be  tested  at  random  4  times  during  the 
season, from October 1 through June 30 (a period that includes, but is not lim-
ited to, training camp, the regular season and the playoffs). Players also remain 
subject to reasonable cause testing at any time.
• Penalties for violators have increased as follows: first offense—10-game suspen-
sion; second offense—25-game suspension; third offense—1-year suspension; and 
fourth offense—dismissal and disqualification from the NBA.
• The  list  of  banned  substances  has  been  expanded  to  include  all  steroids  made 
illegal  by  the  Anabolic  Steroids  Control  Act  of  2004,  plus  additional  steroids, 
stimulants  and  other  performance-enhancing  drugs  banned  by  WADA,  and  a 
provision has been added requiring that any substance declared illegal by Con-
gress will automatically be added to the NBA’s banned substances list.
• Random  drug  tests  will  be  scheduled  by,  and  the  urine  specimens  will  be  col-
lected by, an independent testing organization, without notice to the NBA or the 
Players Association.
• When  a  player  is  suspended  for  a  violation  of  the  Program,  the  substance  for 
which  he  tested  positive  will  be  publicly  announced.  (Previously,  only  the  play-
er’s suspension was publicly announced.)
• The program maintains the involvement of a Prohibited Substances Committee, 
which is comprised of three independent experts in the field of performance-en-
hancing substances, and one representative from both the NBA and the Players 
Association.  The  Committee  is  charged  with  meeting  twice  per  year  to  review 
the list of Prohibited Substances and propose any additions or changes.
• Other  technical  changes  have  been  made  to  the  program,  such  as  lowering  the 
threshold  for  a  positive  testosterone  test  from  a  ratio  of  6:1  to  a  ratio  of  4:1, 
as  WADA  did  earlier  this  year,  and  changing  the  NBA’s  testing  laboratory  to 
one  accredited  by  WADA  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  the  most  advanced  lab-
oratory science.

As  a  result  of  these  changes,  the  NBA  and  the  Players  Association  now  have  in 
place  a  comprehensive,  effective,  and  fair  policy  for  steroids  and  performance-en-
hancing  substances.  Further,  because  the  parties  arrived  at  this  policy  by  agree-
ment—through  the  traditional  collective  bargaining  process—we  are  both  invested 
in  its  success.  The  NBA,  therefore,  does  not  believe  that  legislation  in  this  area  is 
necessary  or  appropriate.  Nevertheless,  if  this  Committee  and  the  Congress  feels 
that  legislation  must  be  enacted,  we  offer  the  following  observations  on  the  specific 
proposals contained in the Clean Sports Act of 2005 and the Professional Sports In-
tegrity and Accountability Act. 

First, while we believe it is important to prohibit a broad list of steroids and per-
formance-enhancing substances and, as a result, have agreed with the Players Asso-
ciation  to  significantly  expand  our  list  of  banned  drugs,  we  do  not  believe  that  the 
entire WADA list of prohibited substances is appropriate for the NBA. The sport of 
basketball emphasizes a specialized set of physical abilities—particularly quickness, 
agility,  and  basketball  skill—that  are  distinct  from  those  required  in  a  number  of 
other  sports.  Accordingly,  illicit  substances  that  could  assist  athletes  in  strength 
sports  (such  as  weightlifting  or  football),  power  sports  (such  as  baseball),  or  endur-
ance  sports  (such  as  cycling  or  marathon  running)  are  not  likely  to  be  of  benefit  to 
NBA  players.  We  therefore  do  not  believe  it  would  be  appropriate  to  require  the 
NBA  to  test  players  for  these  substances,  or  for  the  NBA  to  be  required  to  incur 
the substantial cost of such testing. 

Second, while stiff penalties are necessary for the legitimacy of any anti-drug pro-
gram,  we  believe  that  the  penalties  contained  in  our  new  labor  contract—and  not 
the  more  excessive  penalties  set  forth  in  the  proposed  Acts—are  fair  and  appro-
priate for our sport. A first-time offender of our steroids and performance-enhancing 
drugs  policy  will  be  suspended  from  his  team  for  ten  games.  Because  the  average 
NBA  player  now  earns  approximately  $4.5  million  per  season,  a  ten-game  suspen-
sion  would  result,  on  average,  in  a  financial  penalty  to  the  player  of  more  than 
$400,000. In addition, the player’s suspension and the prohibited substance used by 
the player will be publicly announced, which will appropriately diminish the player’s 
reputation  and  off-the-court  financial  prospects.  A  second  offense  will  result  in  a 
suspension of 25 games, resulting in an average financial penalty of over $1 million, 
and  significantly  affecting  a  player’s  ability  to  obtain  any  performance-based  bo-
nuses in his contract or prove his value for purposes of obtaining a subsequent con-
tract.  For  the  third  offense,  the  player  will  be  suspended  for  one  year.  As  noted 
above,  that  would  result  in  the  average  loss  of  income  of  $4.5  million  and  the  loss 
of one year in a career that, on average, lasts for less than 5 years. After the fourth 
strike, the player would be dismissed and disqualified from the NBA.

31

The  foregoing  penalties,  we  submit,  are  strict  enough  to  punish  violators  appro-
priately,  deter  the  use  of  steroids  and  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  the  NBA, 
and provide fair opportunities for players to conform their conduct. 

In  addition,  the  Professional  Sports  Integrity  and  Accountability  Act,  like  the 
NBA’s  current  drug  policy,  contains  a  ‘‘strict  liability’’  standard—that  is,  a  player 
can commit a violation unknowingly by, for example, ingesting a tainted nutritional 
supplement that is legally sold over the counter. Under those circumstances, a two-
year  ban  (if  the  violation  was  the  player’s  first)  or  a  lifetime  ban  (if  the  violation 
was  the  player’s  second)  are  unduly  harsh.  Indeed,  even  the  WADA  Code  does  not 
provide for strict adherence to the penalties proposed in the bill, and instead makes 
clear  (in  Section  10.5  of  the  Code)  that  special  circumstances—such  as  a  contami-
nated  supplement—should  be  taken  into  account  and  could  result  in  a  reduced  (or 
even  no)  penalty.  Fundamental  fairness  to  athletes  whose  livelihoods  are  at  stake 
should require no less. 

Third,  both  Acts  would  require  that  testing  for  steroids  and  performance-enhanc-
ing  substances  be  ‘‘independently  administered.’’  While  we  believe  the  NBA’s  drug 
program  would  meet  this  standard—because  the  scheduling  of  tests  and  collection 
of samples for all players will now be handled by a third-party testing organization 
without the participation of the NBA or the Players Association—that conclusion is 
not completely clear. The parties, of course, must pay for the services performed by 
the  third-party  testing  organization,  and  neither  Act  indicates  whether  this  fact 
would compromise the ‘‘independence’’ of the relationship. In addition, the NBA and 
the  Players  Association  will  continue  to  have  an  active  role  in  overseeing  our  drug 
program, monitoring the testing, providing input for testing protocols, imposing dis-
cipline, and making improvements—a role that fosters confidence among NBA play-
ers that the program is legitimate, impartial, and fair, which in turn helps the pro-
gram  run  smoothly.  The  NBA  would  oppose  any  legislation  that  did  not  allow  for 
this continuing involvement. 

Fourth,  neither  Act  clearly  indicates  the  forum  for  the  adjudication  of  player  ap-
peals.  (The  Clean  Sports  Act  suggests,  but  does  not  state,  that  the  forum  would  be 
the  Court  of  Arbitration  for  Sport,  which  is  used  by  USADA.  The  Professional 
Sports integrity and Accountability Act suggests, but does not state, that the forum 
would  be  selected  by  each  professional  sports  league.)  In  the  NBA,  any  disputes 
arising  under  the  drug  program  are  to  be  heard  and  resolved  by  an  independent 
grievance arbitrator, and we believe that practice should be continued. 

Fifth, while both Acts set forth certain baseline standards regarding testing, sub-
stances, and penalties, the particulars of those standards are left up to the Federal 
Trade  Commission.  Without  knowing  the  specifics  of  the  regulations,  of  course,  it 
is  not  possible  for  us  to  react  fully  to  the  proposed  legislation,  or  to  anticipate  its 
effect on the NBA. 

Sixth, Section 4(b)(7)(B) of the Act authorizes lesser penalties for players who pro-
vide information about the steroid or performance-enhancing drug use of other play-
ers. We respectfully submit that this is an inappropriate policy in a team—or any—
sport. 

Seventh, both Acts include the concept of a ‘‘therapeutic use exemption’’ for play-
ers with valid medical prescriptions. Currently, the NBA handles this issue through 
the  medical  review  process,  which  takes  place  after  an  adverse  analytical  finding 
is  reported  by  the  laboratory,  not  prior  to  the  collection  of  a  sample  as  is  required 
by  WADA.  Such  a  medical  review  process  is  used  by  employers  nationwide,  includ-
ing the Federal Government. In addition, we believe that the adoption of a WADA-
like  therapeutic  use  exemption  may  conflict  with  the  Americans  with  Disabilities 
Act. 

Finally,  Section  5  of  the  Act  sets  forth  penalties  that  would  apply  only  to  profes-
sional  sports  leagues  if  they  fail  to  implement  drug  testing  programs  that  meet  or 
exceed  the  applicable  minimum  standards.  We  assume,  therefore,  that  the  bill 
would  allow  a  sports  league  simply  to  impose  such  a  program  without  bargaining 
its provisions with the players’ union or otherwise complying with the Federal labor 
laws.  If  that  is  not  the  case,  we  would  suggest  that  the  penalties  contained  in  the 
Act be made applicable to both management and labor, thereby providing incentives 
for  both  parties  to  reach  an  agreement  in  collective  bargaining  that  meets  the  pro-
posed Federal standard. 

In summary, the NBA believes it has a strong and effective drug testing program 
in  place  for  steroids  and  performance-enhancing  substances,  and  does  not  perceive 
a  need  for  Federal  involvement  in  this  area.  If  Congress  nonetheless  sees  fit  to  es-
tablish  minimum  standards  for  such  a  program,  we  suggest  that  they  be  flexible 
enough  to  account  for  characteristics  that  distinguish  one  professional  sport  from 
another, reasonable with respect to penalties, and consistent with all other applica-
ble  laws.  In  all  events,  we  appreciate  the  Committee’s  effort  and  attention  to  this

important  matter,  and  look  forward  to  providing  any  additional  information  or  as-
sistance as necessary. 

I  thank  the  Committee  for  considering  the  views  of  the  NBA  on  this  legislation.

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. 
Mr. Davis, welcome. 

STATEMENT OF ANTONIO DAVIS, NBA PLAYER AND 

PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION 
Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Com-
mittee.  As  President  of  the  National  Basketball  Players  Associa-
tion,  I  accept  this  invitation  from  Chairman  Stevens  to  testify  in 
place  of  our  Executive  Director,  Billy  Hunter,  who  is  recovering 
from surgery. 

As  a  professional  athlete  for  over  15  years,  I  am  appreciative  of 
the  Committee’s  concern  about  the  use  of  steroids  by  professional 
athletes and others, particularly young adults and children, as evi-
denced  by  the  legislation  introduced  by  several  members  of  this 
Committee. 

I would like to begin by clearly stating the position of the NBPA. 
While  we  are  confident  in  our  belief  that  the  use  of  steroids  and 
other  performance-enhancing  drugs  is  virtually  non-existent  in  the 
NBA,  we  are  committed  to  ensuring  that  the  use  of  these  drugs 
does not ever become an issue or concern. 

To  that  end,  in  the  recently  concluded  negotiations  for  the  cur-
rent  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  between  the  NBPA  and 
NBA,  we  greatly  strengthened  the  testing  protocol  for  steroids, 
masking  agents  and  performance-enhancing  drugs  that  was  estab-
lished in the 1999 Agreement. 

It  is  vitally  important  that  the  list  of  banned  substances  for 
which  players  are  tested  remains  current.  Accordingly,  in  our  pro-
gram  that  list  is  updated  regularly  by  our  Prohibited  Substances 
Committee,  and  comprised  of  three  independent  drug  testing  ex-
perts and a representative from both the NBPA and NBA. 

While  our  anti-drug  program  has  always  had  a  strong  emphasis 
on education and treatment rather than punishment, with a stand-
ard of progressive discipline for violators, the program does provide 
for  substantial  penalties,  which  have  been  significantly  increased 
under our new agreement, for those who are caught using steroids 
and other performance-enhancing drugs. 

In  addition  to  severe  penalties  and  increased  frequency  of  test-
ing,  our  anti-drug  policy  is  focused  on  education,  treatment  and 
counseling.  During  each  season,  every  NBA  player  is  required  to 
attend  and  participate  in  meetings  where  the  dangers  of  steroid 
and  performance-enhancing  drug  use  are  discussed  by  drug  coun-
selors.  Also,  all  rookie  players  are  required  to  attend  a  week-long 
Rookie Transition Program, before the start of their first NBA sea-
son. 

Finally,  the  program’s  Medical  Director  supervises  a  national 
network  of  medical  professionals,  located  in  every  NBA  city,  avail-
able to provide counseling and treatment to players. 

We  wanted  to,  and  feel  that  we  have,  sent  a  strong  and  un-
equivocal message to society in general and our young fans in par-
ticular  that  we  do  not  condone,  support  or  accept  the  use  of 
steroids  and  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  our  sport.  Our  will-

33

ingness  to  significantly  increase  the  frequency  of  testing  that  our 
players undergo, and increase the penalties imposed upon violators 
shows  the  utmost  concern  that  we  have  for  this  societal  problem. 
We  continue  to  believe  that  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  is 
the  most  appropriate  forum  for  the  resolution  of  these  issues  and 
are  confident  that  the  changes  made  address  in  a  meaningful  way 
the concerns of the Committee, as embodied in the pending legisla-
tion. 

Congress has long given deference to parties operating under col-
lective  bargaining  agreements  to  develop  their  own  solutions  to 
problems,  properly  recognizing  that  the  parties  bound  by  a  collec-
tive  bargaining  agreement  have  a  longstanding  relationship  with 
unique  problems  and  problem-solving  methods  that  are  often  dif-
ficult to comprehend by those outside the relationship. 

While  we  fully  believe  in  and  support  the  Committee’s  and 
Congress’s goal of eliminating the use of steroids and performance-
enhancing  drugs  in  sports,  we  believe  this  goal  is  best  accom-
plished  by  the  leagues  and  players  working  together  to  accomplish 
this  universal  objective.  We  think  that  the  players,  supported  by 
the  leagues,  are  best  able  to  demonstrate  to  everyone,  especially 
our young fans, that the only way to become a professional athlete 
is by cultivating and nurturing their talent, determination, and de-
sire, and by working harder than everyone else. 

I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you 

today. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Davis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANTONIO DAVIS, NBA PLAYER AND PRESIDENT, NATIONAL 

BASKETBALL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
My  name  is  Antonio  Davis  and  I  am  the  starting  power  forward  for  the  Chicago 
Bulls  as  well  as  the  President  of  the  National  Basketball  Players  Association,  the 
labor union that represents all NBA players in collective bargaining. I appear today 
in response to the invitation of Chairman Stevens to testify. 

As  a  professional  athlete  for  over  15  years,  I  am  appreciative  of  the  Committee’s 
interest in and concern about the use of steroids by professional athletes and others, 
particularly young adults and children, as evidenced by the legislation, S. 1114 and 
S. 1334, introduced by several members of this Committee. 

I  would  like  to  begin  by  clearly  stating  the  position  of  the  NBPA.  While  we  are 
confident  in  our  belief  that  the  use  of  steroids  and  other  performance-enhancing 
drugs are virtually non-existent in the NBA, we are committed to ensuring that the 
use of such drugs does not ever become an issue of concern. 

To that end, in the recently concluded negotiations for the current Collective Bar-
gaining  Agreement  between  the  NBPA  and  NBA  we  greatly  strengthened  the  test-
ing protocol for steroids, masking agents and performance-enhancing drugs that was 
established  in  the  1999  Agreement.  Our  new  Agreement  signed  two  months  ago 
today  provides  for  random  testing  for  all  players  of  up  to  four  (4)  times  during  the 
NBA  season,  which  covers  the  period  from  the  start  of  training  camp  in  October 
through  the  NBA  Finals  in  late  June.  This  new  testing  protocol  is  a  significant 
change  from  the  prior  policy,  which  provided  for  random  testing  of  all  incoming 
players four (4) times during their rookie season and testing of veteran players once 
during the training camp period. 

Additionally,  all  players  remain  subject  to  reasonable  cause  testing  at  any  time. 
If  an  independent  expert  finds  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  a  player  is  using 
steroids the player may be tested up to four (4) times during the following six week 
period. The testing during this period may be administered at any time, without any 
prior notice to the player. 

It is vitally important in the efforts to control the usage of steroids and other per-
formance-enhancing  drugs  that  the  list  of  banned  substances  for  which  players  are 
tested  remains  current.  Accordingly,  in  our  Program  that  list  is  updated  regularly

by our Prohibited Substances Committee, comprised of three independent drug test-
ing  experts  and  a  representative  from  both  the  NBPA  and  NBA.  The  Committee 
may  be  convened  at  any  time  to  ban  a  substance  that  is  either  declared  illegal  by 
the Federal Government or is or reasonably likely to be physically harmful to play-
ers and is or is reasonably likely to be improperly performance-enhancing. I believe 
you will find our list of prohibited substances to be extremely comprehensive. 

While  our  Anti-Drug  Program  has  always  had  a  strong  emphasis  on  education 
and treatment rather than punishment, with a standard of progressive discipline for 
violators, the Anti-Drug Program does provide for substantial penalties, which have 
been  significantly  increased  under  our  new  agreement,  for  those  who  are  caught 
using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. A first time offender is auto-
matically suspended for ten (10) games and is required to enter an education, treat-
ment  and  counseling  program  established  by  the  Program’s  Medical  Director.  For 
a  second  violation  the  player  is  suspended  for  twenty-five  (25)  games  and  required 
to  re-enter  the  education,  treatment  and  counseling  program.  For  a  third  violation, 
the  player  is  suspended  for  one  (1)  year  from  the  date  of  the  offense  and  is  again 
required  to  enter  the  education,  treatment  and  counseling  program.  If  there  is  a 
fourth violation, the player is immediately dismissed and disqualified from the NBA. 
Also,  any  player  who  is  disciplined  for  conduct  involving  steroids,  performance-en-
hancing  drugs  or  masking  agents,  will  have  his  identity,  the  particular  drug  used, 
and the penalty publicly disclosed. 

In  addition  to  severe  penalties  and  increased  frequency  of  testing,  our  Anti-Drug 
Policy is focused on education, treatment and counseling. During each season, every 
NBA  player  is  required  to  attend  and  participate  in  a  meeting  where  the  dangers 
of  steroid  and  performance-enhancing  drug  use  are  discussed  by  drug  counselors. 
Also,  all  rookie  players  are  required  to  attend  a  week  long  Rookie  Transition  Pro-
gram, before the start of their first NBA season, during which numerous topics are 
addressed  in  detail,  including  the  dangers  of  using  steroids  and  performance-en-
hancing  drugs.  Finally,  the  program’s  Medical  Director  supervises  a  national  net-
work of medical professionals, located in every NBA city, available to provide coun-
seling and treatment to players. 

Since  testing  for  steroids  and  other  performance-enhancing  drugs  was  instituted 
in  1999  there  have  been  approximately  4,200  tests  conducted,  with  only  23  initial 
laboratory  positive  tests  (less  than  one  (1)  percent).  Of  the  23  tests  that  were  ini-
tially laboratory positives, only 3 satisfied the additional steps that are required for 
a  sample  to  be  confirmed  as  positive  under  our  Anti-Drug  Program,  either  because 
the player was terminated from employment prior to confirmation of his test result 
or because the Medical Director found a reasonable medical explanation for the test 
result. The three (3) players who had confirmed positive tests were immediately sus-
pended. 

Recognizing  the  increased  scrutiny  that  steroid  and  other  performance-enhancing 
drug  use  has  received  in  society,  and  particularly  in  professional  sports,  since  our 
ground  breaking  agreement  was  reached  in  1999,  we  have  implemented  significant 
and wholesale modifications in our new Anti-Drug Program to deal with the growing 
societal  problem  of  the  use  of  steroids  and  other  performance-enhancing  drugs.  We 
wanted to, and feel that we have, sent a strong and unequivocal message to society 
in  general  and  our  young  fans  in  particular  that  we  do  not  condone,  support  or  ac-
cept the use of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs in our sport. Our willing-
ness to significantly increase the frequency of testing that our players undergo, and 
increase the penalties imposed upon violators evidences the utmost concern that we 
have for this societal problem. 

We  continue  to  believe  that  collective  bargaining  is  the  most  appropriate  forum 
for  the  resolution  of  these  issues  and  are  confident  that  the  changes  made  address 
in  a  meaningful  way  the  concerns  of  the  Committee,  as  embodied  in  the  pending 
legislation, S. 1114 and S. 1334. Congress has long given deference to parties oper-
ating under collective bargaining agreements to develop their own solutions to prob-
lems,  properly  recognizing  that  the  parties  bound  by  a  collective  bargaining  agree-
ment  have  a  longstanding  relationship  with  unique  problems  and  problem  solving 
methods  that  are  often  difficult  to  comprehend  by  those  outside  the  relationship. 
While  we  fully  believe  in  and  support  the  Committees’  and  Congress’  goal  of  elimi-
nating  the  use  of  steroids  and  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  sports,  we  believe 
this goal is best accomplished by the leagues and players working together to accom-
plish  this  universal  objective.  We  think  that  the  players,  supported  by  the  leagues, 
are  best  able  to  demonstrate  to  everyone,  especially  our  young  fans,  that  the  only 
way  to  become  a  professional  athlete  is  by  cultivating  and  nurturing  their  talent, 
determination, and desire, and by working harder than everyone else. 

I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Davis,  an  excellent  statement. 

Thank you. 

Commissioner Bettman. 
STATEMENT OF GARY BETTMAN, COMMISSIONER, NATIONAL 

HOCKEY LEAGUE 

Commissioner  BETTMAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of 
the  Committee,  the  National  Hockey  League  appreciates  being 
given  the  opportunity  to  offer  comments  regarding  the  proposed 
legislation.  The  NHL  will  cooperate  in  any  way  it  can  with  the  ef-
fort  to  eliminate  performance-enhancing  drugs  from  professional 
and amateur athletics. 

While  it  is  the  leagues’  firm  belief  that  the  performance-enhanc-
ing  drug  issue  is  not  a  problem  in  the  NHL,  the  league  is  com-
mitted  to  providing  its  fans  with  outstanding  athletic  competition 
with the assurance that our game is being conducted in an environ-
ment  free  of  performance-enhancing  substances.  The  NHL’s  active 
pursuit of this objective is reflected in the creation of a program we 
just incorporated into our new collective bargaining agreement. 

The  primary  elements  of  this  program  focus  on  the  education  of 
players  regarding  the  health  risk  posed  by  the  use  of  prohibited 
performance-enhancing  substances,  the  treatment  of  players  who 
have  used  prohibited  substances,  and  the  deterrence  and  preven-
tion  of  such  use  through  random,  no-notice  testing  up  to  twice  per 
season  for  the  substances  designated  on  the  out  of  competition  list 
compiled  by  the  World  Anti-Doping  Agency.  In  addition,  the  pro-
gram  provides  for  ‘‘reasonable  cause’’  testing  of  players.  Players 
who  test  positive  will  incur  severe  disciplinary  penalties.  A  first 
positive test results in a suspension of 20 games, one quarter of the 
season, without pay. A second positive test results in a suspension 
of  60  games,  three  quarters  of  a  season,  without  pay.  And  a  third 
positive  test  results  in  a  permanent  suspension  without  pay.  A 
player so suspended can apply for discretionary reinstatement after 
a minimum period of 2 years. 

In the experience of the doctors who administer our program, the 
primary  alleged  benefit  of  steroid  use,  significant  large  muscle  de-
velopment,  is  not  consistent  with  playing  our  sport  at  the  highest 
levels. The bulkiness attributable to steroid use simply is not a de-
sired  characteristic  of  NHL  players.  To  the  extent  there  might  be 
some  limited  usage  of  performance-enhancing  substances  in  the 
NHL, we believe that our program will eradicate any such use. 

For  this  reason  the  NHL  does  not  see  the  need  for  the  proposed 
legislation  as  it  applies  or  relates  to  our  sport.  However,  should 
Congress  proceed  along  the  lines  contemplated  by  the  legislation, 
we have set out our comments in my written statement and we are 
certainly prepared to cooperate. 

I would like to briefly make the following points. We believe that 
minimal  doping  control  standards,  testing  protocols,  and  processes 
should be established by the Director of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, in consultation with the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse,  NIDA,  which  has  particular  expertise  in  addressing  sub-
stance  abuse,  the  United  States  Department  of  Transportation, 
which  is  one  of  the  largest  workplace-testing  entities  in  the  world, 
the  United  States  Anti-Doping  Agency,  USADA,  which  has  exper-

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  14:47 Aug 16, 2006 Jkt 028683 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\28683.TXT JACKF PsN: JACKF

36

tise in the non-workplace testing area, to be specific, amateur com-
petitions,  and  the  subject  sport’s  professional  league.  This  process 
would  provide  the  Director  with  the  information,  resources  and 
practical experience necessary to develop an appropriate workplace, 
and this is a workplace, testing policy for each of the sports. 

As pertaining to the NHL we’d ask the Committee to please bear 
in mind that we have certain unique issues. A third of our players 
come  from  outside  of  North  America,  85  percent  of  our  players 
come  from  outside  the  United  States,  so  issues  relating  to  which 
physicians  need  to  be  licensed  by  which  jurisdiction,  where  testing 
might  be  legal  or  illegal  in  the  off-season,  therapeutic  use  exemp-
tions,  and  testing  labs  are  all  things  that  we  think  need  to  be  rec-
onciled,  particularly  with  Canada,  as  it  relates  to  the  fact  that  we 
play over 200 of our games there. And so with respect to off-season 
testing and the like, we think that indicates why a one-size-fits-all 
solution  doesn’t  work.  We  believe  that  the  USADA  model  of  pen-
alties  of  2  years  for  a  first  test  violation,  and  lifetime  for  a  second 
violation are unduly harsh when applied in the context of the play-
ers  in  the  NHL.  Unlike  International  sports  events,  such  as  the 
World Championships and Olympics which are generally conducted 
on  an  annual  or  bi-annual  or  quadrennial  basis,  the  NHL  season 
consists  of  82  regular  season  games,  plus  playoffs.  Identical  pen-
alties in these two distinctly different environments would result in 
a disparate and unduly harsh impact on NHL players. 

Finally,  in  the  event  this  legislation  is  passed,  we  also  rec-
ommend  that  players  are  provided  in-person  education  and  train-
ing on an annual basis regarding prohibited substances, the nature 
and application of the testing program and the penalties associated 
with violations. 

The NHL believes the public is entitled to have confidence in the 
integrity  of  our  sport  and  to  be  assured  that  our  athletes  are  not 
using  performance-enhancing  drugs.  Every  professional  athlete 
does serve as a role model and with that comes a corresponding re-
sponsibility. 

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Bettman follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARY BETTMAN, COMMISSIONER, NATIONAL HOCKEY 

LEAGUE 

On  behalf  of  the  National  Hockey  League,  and  in  response  to  the  request  of  the 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (hereinafter the ‘‘Sen-
ate Committee’’), this shall constitute my written statement regarding the NHL/Na-
tional  Hockey  League  Players’  Association  performance-enhancing  Substances  Pro-
gram  and  S.  1114  and  S.  1334.  At  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  express  the  NHL’s 
appreciation  for  being  afforded  the  opportunity  to  provide  the  Senate  Committee 
with  our  comments  regarding  the  proposed  legislation.  The  NHL  undertakes  to  co-
operate in any way it can in the effort to eliminate the use of performance-enhanc-
ing drugs in professional and amateur athletics. 
NHL/NHLPA  Agreement  Regarding  Future  Testing  for  Performance-

Enhancing Drugs ″

It  is  our  conviction  that,  as  a  general  matter,  performance-enhancing  drugs  are 
not  a  pervasive  problem  in  the  NHL.  Nevertheless,  we  believe  that  fans  in  par-
ticular,  and  the  public  at  large,  are  entitled—and  deserve—to  have  confidence  that 
our  games  are  being  played  in  a  steroid-free  environment.  Accordingly,  the  NHL 
and its Players’ Association have recognized the need for a modernized drug testing 
and  performance-enhancing  substances  control  policy  that  is  specifically  directed  to 
the  prevention  of  the  use  of  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  our  sport  and,  in  con-

37

junction  with  the  recently  concluded  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  between  the 
NHL and the NHLPA, have established a jointly-administered performance-enhanc-
ing Substances Program (the ‘‘Program’’). 

The primary purposes of the Program include:
• the  education  of  Players  regarding  the  health  risks  posed  by  the  use  of  prohib-
• the treatment of Players who have used Prohibited Substances; and
• the deterrence and prevention of such use through education, random no-notice 

ited performance-enhancing substances (‘‘Prohibited Substances’’);

testing and the imposition of disciplinary penalties where appropriate.

(Attachment  I—2005  CBA,  Section  47.1)  The  CBA  provides  that  the  Program 
shall be jointly administered by a Program Committee comprised of representatives 
of the League and the NHLPA, and consulting expert doctors. 1 The responsibilities 
of the Program Committee include: 

(a) to establish a comprehensive educational program for Players on the dangers 
of Prohibited Substances and the nature of the Program;
(b) to select, and contract with, an appropriate sample collecting authority;
(c) to select, and contract with, an appropriate testing laboratory;
(d)  to  review  the  WADA  list  of  prohibited  performance-enhancing  substances 
and make recommendations to the NHL and NHLPA as to which performance-
enhancing substances on the WADA list are relevant to the sport of hockey and 
should be deemed Prohibited Substances under the Program;
(e)  to  develop  Player  and  Club  notification  procedures  for  positive  test  results;
(f)  to  oversee  the  administration  of  Player  evaluation  and  treatment  following 
positive test results; and
(g)  to  establish  standards  for  the  administration  of  ‘‘reasonable  cause’’  testing. 
(Attachment I—2005 CBA, Section 47.2)

Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Program  Committee,  the  NHL  and  the 
NHLPA  have  agreed  that  NHL  players  will  be  subject  to  testing  under  the  terms 
of  the  performance-enhancing  Substances  Program  for  the  performance-enhancing 
drugs  designated  on  the  WADA  out-of-competition  list.  It  is  our  view  that  this  list 
reflects  those  drugs  that  could  theoretically  affect  the  integrity  of  our  competition, 
our  paramount  concern.  A  copy  of  the  list  of  banned  performance-enhancing  sub-
stances  is  attached  hereto.  (Attachment  II—Prohibited  List)  The  Program  provides 
for  up  to  two  (2)  no-notice  tests  during  the  period  from  the  start  of  Training  Camp 
through  the  end  of  the  Regular  Season. 2 Positive  tests  for  performance-enhancing 
substances will result in mandatory discipline as follows: 

(1)  for  the  first  positive  test,  a  suspension  of  twenty  (20)  NHL  Games  without 
pay, and mandatory referral to the SABH for evaluation and possible treatment;
(2)  for  the  second  positive  test,  a  suspension  of  sixty  (60)  NHL  Games  without 
pay,  and  mandatory  referral  to  the  SABH  program  for  evaluation  and  possible 
treatment;
(3)  for  the  third  positive  test,  a  ‘‘permanent’’  suspension  without  pay,  although 
a Player so suspended may reapply for discretionary reinstatement after a min-
imum period of two (2) years by making an application to the Committee.

(Attachment  I—2005  CBA,  Section  47.7)  The  Program  also  provides  an  oppor-
tunity  for  a  Player  to  challenge  the  imposition  of  any  discipline  in  the  event  he  is 
able to establish an applicable therapeutic use exemption, a testing error, mistaken 
use, or the use of a tainted supplement or other product (i.e., where the Player could 
not have reasonably ascertained the presence of the Prohibited Substance). (Attach-
ment I—2005 CBA, Section 47.8) 

1 The League and the NHLPA have retained Dr. Dave Lewis of Visions Residential Treatment 
Program,  California,  and  Dr.  Brian  Shaw  of  Toronto  Hospital  and  the  Hospital  for  Sick  Chil-
dren, to serve on the Committee as consulting expert doctors. Drs. Lewis and Shaw have exten-
sive  experience  in  treating  problems  related  to  substance  abuse,  including  among  professional 
athletes,  and  have  served  as  the  NHL/NHLPA  Substance  Abuse  and  Behavioral  Health  (‘‘Sub-
stance  Abuse  Program’’  or  ‘‘SABH’’)  Program  Doctors  since  the  inception  of  the  SABH  Program 
in 1995.

2 Given the relatively short time frame between the ratification of the new CBA and the start 
of  the  2005/2006  NHL  season,  the  NHL  and  the  NHLPA  have  agreed  that,  with  respect  to  the 
2005/2006  season  only,  players  will  be  subject  to  testing  beginning  on  January  15,  2006,  after 
the  consulting  expert  doctors  have  provided  all  Players  with  an  orientation  session  regarding 
the Program.

38

The  Program  incorporates  a  mandatory  educational  component  which  provides 
that  the  Players  shall  receive:  education  on  Prohibited  Substances  and  the  nature 
of  the  Program  each  League  Year  during  Training  Camp,  provided,  however,  that 
no  testing  shall  take  place  and  no  discipline  shall  be  imposed  under  the  Program 
until the Committee has provided a Player with an orientation session regarding the 
Program, which shall include an in-person presentation on the Program and the dis-
tribution  of  informational  materials  describing  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  Program, 
including the list of Prohibited Substances, testing procedures and disciplinary pen-
alties.  Education  and  training  on  the  details  of  the  Program  will  also  be  provided 
to Club Athletic Trainers and Club physicians. Over time, and to the extent feasible, 
the  Committee  will  endeavor  to  develop  an  ‘‘approved  list’’  of  nutritional  supple-
ments,  which  will  have  been  tested  and  certified  as  being  free  of  Prohibited  Sub-
stances. 

(Attachment I—2005 CBA, Section 47.4) This provision reflects the comprehensive 
nature  of  the  Program,  and  the  belief  of  the  NHL  and  the  NHLPA  that  education 
regarding the dangers of illegal substances (both performance-enhancing and other-
wise) is, perhaps, the most effective tool in preventing use and abuse. 
NHL/NHLPA Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program 

Prior  to  the  creation  and  implementation  of  the  Program,  the  NHL  and  the 
NHLPA addressed problems of substance abuse (including abuse of performance-en-
hancing  substances)  through  the  NHL/NHLPA  Substance  Abuse  Program  (Attach-
ment  III), *  which  was  jointly  developed  and  implemented  in  1995  in  conjunction 
with  the  parties’  prior  collective  bargaining  agreement.  The  Substance  Abuse  Pro-
gram was designed to be a ‘‘comprehensive effort to address substance abuse among 
NHL  players  and  their  families,  to  treat  those  with  a  substance  abuse  problem  in 
a  confidential,  fair  and  effective  way,  and  to  deter  such  abuse  in  the  future.’’  (At-
tachment III, SABH Program Section 1) In order to accomplish these goals, the Sub-
stance  Abuse  Program  incorporates  education,  counseling,  inpatient  and  outpatient 
treatment,  follow-up  care,  and  where  appropriate,  punitive  sanctions,  up  to  and  in-
cluding  permanent  suspension  from  play  in  the  League.  On  a  going-forward  basis, 
those  players  who  are  found  to  be  using  performance-enhancing  substances  will  be 
subject to mandatory discipline as outlined above under the performance-enhancing 
Substances  Program,  and  will  also  be  referred  to  the  Substance  Abuse  Program  for 
evaluation and treatment. 

Historically,  the  players  who  have  been  treated  under  the  Substance  Abuse  Pro-
gram  have  exhibited  problems  associated  with  alcohol  and/or  ‘‘recreational’’  drug 
use, rather than steroid (or steroid precursor) use. The experience of our Substance 
Abuse  Program  in  this  regard  is  not  surprising  when  one  considers  that  primary 
of  the  alleged  benefits  of  steroid  use—significant  large  muscle  development—is  not 
consistent  with  playing  hockey  at  the  highest  levels  of  the  sport,  and  the  resulting 
bulkiness attributable to steroid use simply is not a desired characteristic of skilled 
NHL  players. 3 Nevertheless,  in  the  event  NHL  players  were  to  exhibit  symptoms 
associated  with  abuse  of  performance-enhancing  drugs,  the  Substance  Abuse  Pro-
gram  was  broad  enough  in  scope  to  provide  treatment  (and  if  appropriate,  dis-
cipline) for such players and the Substance Abuse Program Doctors were empowered 
to intervene in any manner they felt was appropriate. 
Drug Testing of NHL Players in International Hockey Competitions 

The  frequent  and  consistent  participation  of  NHL  players  in  international  com-
petitions,  and  the  drug  testing  NHL  players  undergo  in  connection  therewith,  pro-
vide objective support for our belief that the use of performance-enhancing drugs by 
NHL  players  is  negligible,  to  the  extent  it  exists  at  all. 4 Over  the  past  ten  years, 
NHL  players  have  represented  their  nations  of  origin  annually  in  connection  with 
the  IIHF  World  Championships,  twice  in  Olympic  competitions  in  1998  and  2002, 
and  just  this  past  year  in  the  2004  World  Cup  of  Hockey,  which  the  NHL  and  the 

* The information referred to has been retained in Committee files. 
3 Our  belief  that  steroid  use  is  not  desired  by  or  prevalent  among  skilled  hockey  players  is 
seemingly  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  there  have  been  only  eight  positive  results  in  approxi-
mately 3,100 tests of NHL and non-NHL players administered at the World Hockey Champion-
ships (conducted by the International Ice Hockey Federation (‘‘IIHF’’)) since 1993/94. 

4 We  are  aware  of  recent  statements  by  Dave  Morissette  and  Andrew  Peters  regarding  their 
use  of  performance-enhancing  drugs,  but  for  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  do  not  believe  that 
their  experiences  are  representative  of  the  vast  majority  of  NHL  players.  Indeed,  Dave 
Morissette played in only 11 NHL games in his career. We further note that Mr. Peters’ asser-
tion  that  he  stopped  taking  andro  after  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services 
issued  a  report  about  the  health  risks  associated  with  taking  the  substance  provides  further 
support  for  our  assertion  that  it  is  essential  to  provide  training  and  education  on  the  dangers 
of performance-enhancing drugs.

NHLPA  organized  and  sponsored.  In  connection  with  international  play,  the  NHL 
and  its  players  are  held  to  and  abide  by  the  international  standards  of  the  World 
Anti-Doping Agency (‘‘WADA’’), which have been adopted by the IIHF. 

In  the  past  ten  years,  of  the  nearly  1,000  NHL  players  who  have  participated  in 
the  IIHF  World  Championships,  the  Olympics,  and  the  World  Cup  of  Hockey  com-
petitions,  and  were  subject  to  drug  testing  in  connection  therewith,  we  are  aware 
of only three positive tests for performance-enhancing drugs. 5 And of the three, one 
of  the  players  tested  positive  for  salbutamol,  a  drug  that  is  also  used  for  asthma 
as  a  Proventil  inhaler,  and  which  may  be  used  with  a  Therapeutic  Use  Exemption. 
A second player tested positive for tramadol, a substance which is designated as an 
‘‘allowed narcotic’’ ( i.e., a prescribed painkiller). The third player established a ‘‘mis-
taken use’’ defense in connection with his use of over-the-counter nutritional supple-
ments. 
S. 1114, The Clean Sports Act of 2005 

The National Hockey League has reviewed the proposed Clean Sports Act of 2005 
and,  as  stated  above,  is  supportive  of  a  program  featuring  mandatory  testing  and 
discipline  imposed  in  connection  with  an  athlete’s  use  of  performance-enhancing 
drugs.  The  NHL  remains  of  the  belief  that,  given  the  mandatory  and  effective  Pro-
gram agreed to by the NHL and the NHLPA, which has been designed to eradicate 
the  use  of  all  performance-enhancing  drugs  from  our  game,  we  do  not  see  a  need 
for  the  proposed  legislation  as  it  would  relate  to  the  NHL.  However,  should  Con-
gress decide to proceed in this area and legislate along the lines that this proposed 
legislation  contemplates,  the  NHL’s  specific  comments  regarding  the  provisions  of 
the proposed legislation are as follows:

• The  proposed  legislation  provides  that  professional  sports  leagues  shall  be  sub-
ject to the minimum doping control standards established by the United States 
Anti-Doping  Agency  Protocol  (‘‘USADA’’)  for  Olympic  Movement  Testing,  and 
shall  consult  with  USADA  in  the  development  of  its  test  distribution  plan,  its 
drug testing protocols, and its adjudication process. We believe that the Director 
of  the  Office  of  National  Drug  Control  Policy  shall  be  responsible  for  estab-
lishing  minimum  doping  control  standards  for  each  sport,  as  well  as  test  dis-
tribution  plans,  testing  protocols  and  adjudication  procedures,  and  that  the  Di-
rector  shall  establish  the  foregoing  after  consultation  with:  (1)  the  National  In-
stitute  on  Drug  Abuse  (‘‘NIDA’’),  which  has  particular  expertise  in  addressing 
substance  abuse;  (2)  the  United  States  Department  of  Transportation,  which  is 
one of the largest workplace-testing entities in the world; (3) USADA, which has 
expertise  in  the  non-workplace  testing  arena  of  amateur  competitions;  and  (4) 
the subject professional sports league. We believe that the foregoing entities to-
gether would provide the Director with the information, resources, and practical 
experience  necessary  to  develop  an  appropriate  workplace  testing  policy  and 
procedure  applicable  to  the  employees  ( i.e.,  the  players)  for  each  professional 
sport.  We  do  not  believe  it  is  appropriate  for  the  standards  set  by  USADA  to 
set a floor for the minimum requirements applicable for the professional sports 
leagues,  by  default.  ( See  Section  4(b))  We  believe  that  the  foregoing  process 
shall  also  apply  in  the  context  of  the  annual  certifications  outlined  in  Sections 
4(b)(2) and 4(b)(3).
• Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the proposed legislation provides for ‘‘each professional ath-
lete  [to  be]  tested  a  minimum  of  5  times  each  calendar  year  that  such  athlete 
is  competing  in  games  organized  by  the  major  professional  league.’’  Section 
4(b)(1)(B)  provides  that  each  athlete  shall  be  tested  ‘‘(i)  at  least  3  times,  each 
with  no  advance  notice,  during  each  season  of  play;  and  (ii)  at  least  2  times, 
each  with  no  advance  notice,  during  the  off-season.’’  The  National  Hockey 
League  plays  its  games  in  two  different  countries  and  features  athletes  hailing 
from twenty-two countries around the globe. One-third of NHL players are from 
outside  of  North  America  and  eighty-five  percent  are  from  outside  the  United 
States. For this reason, and giving appropriate consideration to the fact that the 
NHL does not have a pervasive problem with its players using performance-en-
hancing  substances,  in-season  testing  makes  particular  sense.  While  we  do  not 

5 In  connection  with  international  competitions  in  which  NHL  players  have  participated  over 
the past ten years, the Program Doctors along with the USOC administered the pre-competition 
drug  testing  for  the  Olympics,  and  the  IOC  administered  the  in-competition  testing.  The  Pro-
gram Doctors administered the out-of-competition and in-competition testing for the World Cup 
of Hockey. The IIHF administered the in-competition testing for the World Championships. With 
respect  to  the  tests  administered  by  the  IIHF,  the  IOC  and  the  USOC,  it  is  our  understanding 
that  no  NHL  player  had  a  positive  test  result  for  performance-enhancing  drugs;  however,  we 
do not have access to specific data or testing results.

object to subjecting NHL players to random no-notice testing during the off-sea-
son,  we  would  not  advocate  that  it  be  mandatory  for  sports  leagues  in  general, 
and the NHL in particular, to conduct off-season testing given the logistical dif-
ficulties  that  would  arise  in  connection  with  testing  players  scattered  through-
out  the  world.  The  standard  adopted  by  the  NHL  and  the  NHLPA,  requiring 
up  to  two  (2)  in-season  tests,  was  designed  to  insure  the  effectiveness  of  the 
Program while recognizing the realities of professional hockey. In the event leg-
islation  is  passed  requiring  more  than  two  tests  per  calendar  year,  we  would 
advocate  that  there  be  no  more  than  four  tests  required  annually,  and  that  it 
be permissible to evenly distribute such tests once per calendar quarter.
• Section 4(b)(4) provides that ‘‘a major professional league may make exceptions 
for  any  prohibited  substances  that  have  been  properly  prescribed  by  a  doctor 
of medicine licensed in the United States for legitimate and documented thera-
peutic  purposes.’’  We  would  recommend  that  this  provision  be  clarified  to  pro-
vide that the exception may be granted retroactively by a medical review officer, 
after a player has tested positive for a banned substance in the event an inves-
tigation reveals that the substance was properly prescribed for a legitimate and 
documented therapeutic purpose. In addition, the fact that there are six (6) Ca-
nadian-based  NHL  teams  would  necessitate  that  Canadian  licensed  physicians 
also  be  authorized  to  prescribe  medications  qualifying  for  a  therapeutic  use  ex-
emption. 6 
• Section 4(b)(5) provides for the samples to be analyzed by a laboratory approved 
by  USADA.  We  would  recommend  that  Canadian-based  laboratories  approved 
by  the  World  Anti-Doping  Agency  (‘‘WADA’’)  also  be  authorized  to  analyze  the 
samples.
• Section  4(b)(6)  provides  that  a  ‘‘refusal  by  a  professional  athlete  to  submit  to 
a  test  or  a  failure  of  a  professional  athlete  to  submit  to  a  test  without  compel-
ling justification shall also be considered a positive test.’’ If the requirement re-
garding  mandatory  offseason  testing  is  maintained,  we  would  recommend  that 
the legislation address the testing of players in foreign countries (of course, any 
such  testing,  if  allowed  at  all,  would  need  to  be  performed  in  accordance  with 
applicable laws in the local jurisdiction), or alternatively, recognize as a compel-
ling  justification  the  absence  of  a  player  from  the  United  States  at  the  time  of 
a requested test, thus recognizing the international makeup of NHL players and 
the fact that many such players return to their native countries during the off-
season.
• Section  4(b)(7)  of  the  proposed  legislation  provides  for  a  minimum  suspension 
of  two  (2)  years  for  an  athlete  who  tests  positive  for  their  first  violation,  and 
for  the  ‘‘lifetime  ban  of  the  professional  athlete  from  all  major  professional 
leagues’’  for  an  athlete  who  commits  a  second  violation.  The  NHL  agrees  that 
a  player  who  tests  positive  for  performance-enhancing  drugs  should  be  subject 
to  a  significant  punishment,  and  further  agrees  that  progressive  discipline 
should  be  imposed  for  a  player  who  tests  positive  more  than  once.  We  believe 
that the USADA model penalties are unduly harsh when applied in the context 
of professional hockey players in the National Hockey League. The proposed leg-
islation incorporates a significant and meaningful penalty of a two-year ban for 
a first-time offender in the context of international ‘‘amateur’’ competitions that 
take  place  relatively  infrequently,  as  compared  to  NHL  games.  In  the  inter-
national  sports  environment,  events  are  generally  conducted  on  an  annual,  bi-
annual  or  quadrennial  basis  (e.g.,  Olympics,  World  Championships),  while  in 
the NHL, there are 82 regular season games each season in addition to playoff 
games  for  eligible  clubs.  Imposition  of  identical  penalties  in  these  two  distinct 
environments would result in a disparate, and in our opinion, unduly harsh im-
pact on NHL players. Further, given the limited career length of a professional 
athlete,  we  believe  a  two  (2)  year  suspension  for  a  first-time  offender  is  too 
harsh, resulting in an excessive impact on the athlete’s ability to earn a ‘‘liveli-
hood.’’
• Section 4(b)(9) of the proposed legislation provides that a positive test shall re-
sult in the public disclosure of the ‘‘identity of any professional player who has 
tested  positive  as  well  as  the  prohibited  substance  or  prohibited  method  for 
which he tested positive not later than 30 days after receiving the test results.’’ 
The  NHL  agrees  that  it  would  be  appropriate  to  publicly  disclose  the  name  of 

6 Canadian  NHL  team  physicians  also  may  treat  and  prescribe  medications  to  visiting  teams’ 
players—including United States-based teams—who suffer an injury while playing in one of the 
246 NHL games played in Canada.

an athlete who has tested positive for the use of a performance-enhancing drug, 
but  believe  that  prior  to  such  disclosure—and  even  in  the  event  an  appeal  is 
not  filed—it  would  be  prudent  to  implement  a  process  that  would  require  a 
medical  review  officer  to  contact  the  player  who  tested  positive  to  determine 
whether  there  is  an  legitimate  medical  explanation 7 for  the  player’s  use  of  the 
banned  substance.  If  so,  and  the  player  has  a  proper  medical  prescription  au-
thorizing the use of the substance, the positive test results should be considered 
cancelled,  penalties  should  not  be  imposed,  and  no  public  disclosure  of  the  test 
result  should  be  made.  If,  however,  a  legitimate  medical  explanation  for  the 
player’s  use  of  the  banned  substance  does  not  exist,  it  would  then  be  appro-
priate to make the positive test results public and impose discipline, in addition 
to providing counseling and treatment. 
• Section  6  of  the  proposed  legislation  provides  that  the  Commission  may  seek  a 
civil  penalty  of  not  more  than  $1,000,000  for  each  violation  of  section  4.  We 
would  advocate  that  any  such  penalty  be  assessed  to  the  parties  administering 
the collective bargaining relationship.
• In the event legislation is passed regarding performance-enhancing substances, 
we  would  recommend  that  such  legislation  include  an  obligation  on  the  profes-
sional  sports  leagues  to  provide  in-person  education  and  training  to  its  players 
on an annual basis regarding prohibited substances and the nature of the appli-
cable  testing  program,  including  the  penalties  associated  with  violations  of  the 
program.

S. 1334, Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act 

To  the  extent  S.  1334  has  provisions  identical  to  S.  1114,  the  NHL’s  comments 
regarding the proposed legislation are set forth above. The NHL’s specific comments 
regarding  the  provisions  of  S.  1334  that  are  materially  different  from  S.  1114  are 
as follows:

• Section 5(d)(1) of the proposed legislation provides for ‘‘each professional athlete 
[to  be]  tested  for  the  use  of  prohibited  substances  and  methods  no  less  than  3 
times  in  each  calendar  year  that  the  athlete  competes  in  a  professional  sports 
league.’’ Section 5(d) further provides for tests to be conducted ‘‘at random inter-
vals throughout the entire calendar year . . . ’’ As stated above, in-season test-
ing makes particular sense for the NHL. The proposed legislation seems to per-
mit  such  testing  to  occur  at  random  intervals  in  each  ‘‘third’’  of  the  calendar 
year,  thus  effectively  addressing  the  impracticalities  associated  with  off-season 
testing  of  non-North  American  based  NHL  players.  We  would  recommend  that 
each team’s entire roster of players be tested at the same time during the NHL 
season on a no-notice basis.
• Section  5(e)  of  the  proposed  legislation  provides  that  a  professional  sports 
league shall publicly disclose the name of any violator, the penalty imposed, and 
a  description  of  the  violation  ‘‘not  later  than  10  days  after  receiving  notice  of 
a  violation . . . ’’  As  stated  above,  it  is  our  view  that  public  disclosure  would 
not be appropriate until after a medical review officer has contacted the player 
who  tested  positive  to  determine  whether  there  is  a  legitimate  medical  expla-
nation for the player’s use of the banned substance, and any appeal process has 
been fully adjudicated.

The  public  is  entitled  to  have  confidence  in  the  integrity  of  competition  in  the 
game of hockey and in all professional sports, and to watch the exceptional athletes 
of  today  compete  on  a  level  playing  field,  free  of  the  influence  of  performance-en-
hancing  drugs.  Every  professional  athlete  serves  as  a  role  model,  and  with  that 
comes a corresponding responsibility to engage exclusively in conduct that will bring 
honor to himself, his team, and the game in which he earns his livelihood. For these 
reasons, we support the requirement that the NHL and the other professional sports 
leagues conduct mandatory testing on athletes for performance-enhancing drugs. 

ATTACHMENT I—ARTICLE 47—PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING SUBSTANCES PROGRAM 
47.1 Introduction. The parties agree to the establishment of a jointly-administered 
performance-enhancing  Substances  Program  (‘‘Program’’),  which  shall  have  as  its 
primary  purposes  the  education  of  Players  regarding  the  health  risks  posed  by  the 
use  of  prohibited  performance-enhancing  substances  (‘‘Prohibited  Substances’’);  the

Workplace Drug Testing Programs).

treatment of Players who have used Prohibited Substances; and the deterrence and 
prevention of such use through education, random no-notice testing and the imposi-
tion of disciplinary penalties where appropriate. 

47.2 Program Committee. The Program shall be jointly administered by a Program 
Committee (‘‘Committee’’) comprised of an equal number of League and NHLPA rep-
resentatives  and  one  (1)  consulting  expert  doctor  nominated  by  each  party.  The  re-
sponsibilities of the Committee shall include, among other things:

(a) to establish a comprehensive educational program for Players on the dangers 
of Prohibited Substances and the nature of the Program;
(b) to select, and contract with, an appropriate sample collecting authority;
(c) to select, and contract with, an appropriate testing laboratory;
(d)  to  review  the  WADA  list  of  prohibited  performance-enhancing  substances 
and make recommendations to the NHL and NHLPA as to which performance-
enhancing substances on the WADA list are relevant to the sport of hockey and 
should be deemed Prohibited Substances under the Program;
(e)  to  develop  Player  and  Club  notification  procedures  for  positive  test  results;
(f)  to  oversee  the  administration  of  Player  evaluation  and  treatment  following 
positive test results; and
(g)  to  establish  standards  for  the  administration  of  ‘‘reasonable  cause’’  testing.
The Committee shall endeavor to render unanimous decisions with respect to mat-
ters  committed  to  it  pursuant  to  this  Article.  In  the  absence  of  a  unanimous  deci-
sion, a decision by the majority of Committee members shall govern. When a major-
ity  decision  cannot  be  reached,  the  two  (2)  consulting  expert  doctors  shall  select  an 
ad  hoc  expert  doctor  who  shall  cast  the  deciding  vote  with  respect  to  the  matter  at 
issue. 

47.3 Scope of Program. The Program shall be limited to addressing the testing for 
and  use  of  prohibited  performance-enhancing  substances  (Prohibited  Substances). 
All  other  forms  of  ‘‘substance  abuse’’  and  behavioral  and  domestic  issues  requiring 
employee assistance will continue to be handled through the NHL/NHLPA Program 
for Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health (the ‘‘SABH Program’’). 

47.4  Educational  Initiatives.  Players  shall  receive  education  on  Prohibited  Sub-
stances  and  the  nature  of  the  Program  each  League  Year  during  Training  Camp, 
provided,  however,  that  no  testing  shall  take  place  and  no  discipline  shall  be  im-
posed  under  the  Program  until  the  Committee  has  provided  a  Player  with  an  ori-
entation  session  regarding  the  Program,  which  shall  include  an  in-person  presen-
tation on the Program and the distribution of informational materials describing all 
relevant aspects of the Program, including the list of Prohibited Substances, testing 
procedures  and  disciplinary  penalties.  Education  and  training  on  the  details  of  the 
Program  will  also  be  provided  to  Club  Athletic  Trainers  and  Club  physicians.  Over 
time,  and  to  the  extent  feasible,  the  Committee  will  endeavor  to  develop  an  ‘‘ap-
proved list’’ of nutritional supplements, which will have been tested and certified as 
being free of Prohibited Substances. 

47.5  Prohibited  Substances.  The  NHL  and  the  NHLPA  shall  be  responsible  for 
maintaining  the  list  of  Prohibited  Substances  (the  ‘‘Prohibited  Substances  List’’). 
Upon receiving the Committee’s recommendations made pursuant to Section 47.2(d) 
above,  the  parties  shall  confer  and  agree  upon  the  Prohibited  Substances  to  be  in-
cluded  on  the  List.  Changes  to  substances  on  the  List  may  only  be  as  negotiated 
by the NHL and the NHLPA. There shall be no retesting of samples based on newly 
discovered  substances  not  included  on  the  Prohibited  Substances  List  at  the  time 
of the original testing. 

47.6 Testing Procedures. Every NHL Player who has participated in an orientation 
session pursuant to Section 47.4 will be subject to up to two (2) no-notice tests dur-
ing the period from the start of Training Camp through the end of the Regular Sea-
son. All such tests will be conducted at the Clubs’ facility on the day of a scheduled 
practice, as opposed to on a game day. 

47.7  Disciplinary  Penalties.  Positive  tests  for  performance-enhancing  substances 

will result in mandatory discipline as follows:

(a)  for  the  first  positive  test,  a  suspension  of  twenty  (20)  NHL  Games  without 
pay,  and  mandatory  referral  to  the  SABH  Program  for  evaluation  and  possible 
treatment;
(b)  for  the  second  positive  test,  a  suspension  of  sixty  (60)  NHL  Games  without 
pay,  and  mandatory  referral  to  the  SABH  Program  for  evaluation  and  possible 
treatment;

43

(c)  for  the  third  positive  test,  a  ‘‘permanent’’  suspension  without  pay,  although 
a Player so suspended can reapply for discretionary reinstatement after a min-
imum period of two (2) years by making an application to the Committee.

47.8  Appeal  Procedures.  The  NHLPA  may,  on  a  Player’s  behalf,  appeal  a  positive 
test  to  the  Impartial  Arbitrator  on  an  expedited  basis,  utilizing  the  procedures  set 
forth  in  Article  17  of  the  Agreement.  A  strict  liability  standard  will  be  employed 
with respect to all positive tests. Notwithstanding the above, the Player shall be en-
titled  to  challenge  the  imposition  of  any  discipline  in  the  event  he  is  able  to  estab-
lish  an  applicable  therapeutic  use  exemption  (as  described  in  Section  47.9  hereof), 
a  testing  error,  mistaken  use,  or  the  use  of  a  tainted  supplement  or  other  product 
( i.e.,  where  the  Player  could  not  have  reasonably  ascertained  the  presence  of  the 
Prohibited  Substance).  To  the  extent  a  Player  successfully  establishes  a  defense  to 
a positive test, he may avoid the mandatory suspension, but will in all cases be re-
ferred  to  the  SABH  Program  for  evaluation  and  possible  treatment.  A  Player  who 
files a timely appeal may not be suspended pursuant to Section 47.7 until a decision 
on the appeal has been rendered by the Impartial Arbitrator. 

47.9  Therapeutic  Use  Exemption.  A  Player  may  apply  to  the  Committee  for  a 
therapeutic  use  exemption  with  respect  to  a  particular  Prohibited  Substance.  The 
Committee  shall  consider  and  act  upon  such  Player’s  application  expeditiously  and 
approval of the application shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

47.10  Confidentiality.  Test  results  will  be  kept  confidential,  subject  to  the  fol-
lowing limited exception: once a positive test has been confirmed after appeal to the 
Impartial  Arbitrator,  or  if  no  appeal  is  taken,  the  Player  suspended  will  be  identi-
fied, and it will be announced that the Player ‘‘ has been suspended for violating the 
terms of the NHL/NHLPA Program for performance-enhancing Substances.’’

47.11  Program  Funding.  Any  salary  forfeited  by  a  Player  by  reason  of  a  suspen-
sion imposed pursuant to Section 47.7 will be utilized to help defer the costs of both 
the  Program  and  the  SABH  Program.  All  costs  of  administering  the  Program,  in-
cluding the costs associated with mandatory no-notice testing, shall be the responsi-
bility of the NHL. 

47.12 Mandatory Legislation. The parties agree that to the extent mandatory and 
binding  legislation  goes  into  effect  that  requires  material  changes  to  the  Program, 
the provisions of the Program will become null and void and the parties will endeav-
or to collectively bargain over a revised Program that complies with such legislation 
and that is agreeable to both parties.

of  the  Prohibited  Substance  or  its  metabolites  or  markers  and/or  the  relevant 
ratio(s) in the Athlete’s Sample is attributable to a physiological or pathological con-

erence steroid profiles, for a possible Use of a Prohibited Substance. 

If  the  laboratory  has  reported  the  presence  of  a  T/E  ratio  greater  than  four  (4) 
to  one  (1)  in  the  urine,  further  investigation  is  obligatory  in  order  to  determine 
whether  the  ratio  is  due  to  a  physiological  or  pathological  condition,  except  if  the 
laboratory  reports  an  Adverse  Analytical  Finding  based  on  any  reliable  analytical 
method, showing that the Prohibited Substance is of exogenous origin. 

In  case  of  an  investigation,  it  will  include  a  review  of  any  previous  and/or  subse-
quent  tests.  If  previous  tests  are  not  available,  the  Athlete  shall  be  tested  unan-
nounced at least three times within a three month period. 

Should  an  Athlete  fail  to  cooperate  in  the  investigations,  the  Athlete’s  Sample 

shall be deemed to contain a Prohibited Substance. 
2.  Other  Anabolic  Agents,  Including  but  not  Limited  to:  Clenbuterol,  Zeranol, 

Zilpaterol.

For purposes of this section:

*‘‘exogenous’’  refers  to  a  substance  which  is  not  capable  of  being  produced  by 
the body naturally.
**‘‘endogenous’’ refers to a substance which is capable of being produced by the 
body naturally.

S2. Hormones and Related Substances 

The  following  substances,  including  other  substances  with  a  similar  chemical 
structure  or  similar  biological  effect(s),  and  their  releasing  factors,  are  prohibited:

1. Erythropoietin (EPO); 
2.  Growth  Hormone  (hGH),  Insulin-like  Growth  Factor  (IGF–1),  Mechano 
Growth Factors (MGFs); 
3. Gonadotrophins (LH, hCG); 
4. Insulin; 
5. Corticotrophins.

Unless  the  Athlete  can  demonstrate  that  the  concentration  was  due  to  a  physio-
logical  or  pathological  condition,  a  Sample  will  be  deemed  to  contain  a  Prohibited 
Substance  (as  listed  above)  where  the  concentration  of  the  Prohibited  Substance  or 
its metabolites and/or relevant ratios or markers in the Athlete’s Sample so exceeds 
the range of values normally found in humans so that it is unlikely to be consistent 
with normal endogenous production. 

The presence of other substances with a similar chemical structure or similar bio-
logical  effect(s),  diagnostic  marker(s)  or  releasing  factors  of  a  hormone  listed  above 
or of any other finding which indicate(s) that the substance detected is of exogenous 
origin, will be reported as an Adverse Analytical Finding. 
S3. Beta-2 Agonists 

All beta-2 agonists including their D- and L-isomers are prohibited. Their use re-

quires a Therapeutic Use Exemption. 

As an exception, formoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol and terbutaline, when admin-
istered  by  inhalation  to  prevent  and/or  treat  asthma  and  exercise-induced  asthma/
broncho-constriction require an abbreviated Therapeutic Use Exemption. 

Despite  the  granting  of  a  Therapeutic  Use  Exemption,  when  the  Laboratory  has 
reported a concentration of salbutamol (free plus glucuronide) greater than 1000 ng/
mL,  this  will  be  considered  as  an  Adverse  Analytical  Finding  unless  the  athlete

proves  that  the  abnormal  result  was  the  consequence  of  the  therapeutic  use  of  in-
haled salbutamol. 
S4. Agents With Anti-Estrogenic Activity 

The following classes of anti-estrogenic substances are prohibited:

1.  Aromatase  inhibitors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  anastrozole,  letrozole, 
aminogluthetimide, exemestane, formestane, testolactone.
2.  Selective  Estrogen  Receptor  Modulators  (SERMs)  including,  but  not  limited 
to, raloxifene, tamoxifen, toremifene.
3.  Other  anti-estrogenic  substances  including,  but  not  limited  to,  clomiphene, 
cyclofenil, fulvestrant.

S5. Diuretics and Other Masking Agents 

Diuretics  and  other  masking  agents  are  prohibited.  Masking  agents  include  but 
are not limited to: Diuretics*, epitestosterone, probenecid, alpha-reductase inhibitors 
(e.g.  finasteride,  dutasteride),  plasma  expanders  (e.g.  albumin,  dextran,  hydroxy-
ethyl starch). 

Diuretics include: acetazolamide, amiloride, bumetanide, canrenone, chlortalidone, 
etacrynic  acid,  furosemide,  indapamide,  metolazone,  spironolactone,  thiazides  (e.g. 
bendroflumethiazide,  chlorothiazide,  hydrochlorothiazide),  triamterene,  and  other 
substances with a similar chemical structure or similar biological effect(s).

*A Therapeutic Use Exemption is not valid if an Athlete’s urine contains a diu-
retic  in  association  with  threshold  or  sub-threshold  levels  of  a  Prohibited  Sub-
stance(s).

Prohibited Methods 
M1. Enhancement of Oxygen Transfer 

The following are prohibited:

a.  Blood  doping,  including  the  use  of  autologous,  homologous  or  heterologous 
blood or red blood cell products of any origin, other than for medical treatment.
b.  Artificially  enhancing  the  uptake,  transport  or  delivery  of  oxygen,  including 
but  not  limited  to  perfluorochemicals,  efaproxiral  (RSR13)  and  modified 
haemoglobin  products  (e.g.  haemoglobin-based  blood  substitutes,  microencap-
sulated haemoglobin products).

M2. Chemical and Physical Manipulation 

The following is prohibited: 
Tampering,  or  attempting  to  tamper,  in  order  to  alter  the  integrity  and  validity 

of Samples collected in Doping Controls. 

These  include  but  are  not  limited  to  intravenous  infusions*,  catheterisation,  and 

urine substitution.

*Except as a legitimate acute medical treatment, intravenous infusions are pro-
hibited.

M3. Gene Doping 

The  non-therapeutic  use  of  cells,  genes,  genetic  elements,  or  of  the  modulation  of 
gene expression, having the capacity to enhance athletic performance, is prohibited.

STATEMENT OF TED SASKIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE PLAYERS’ ASSOCIATION 

Mr.  SASKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Committee  Members.  I  want  to 
at the outset, clearly and emphatically state to this Committee that 
the  NHLPA  membership  and  officials  in  our  organization,  includ-
ing myself, are strongly opposed to the use of performance-enhanc-
ing  substances  by  anyone  in  our  sport.  There  are  three  main  rea-
sons  for  this  position.  First,  the  NHLPA  is  keenly  concerned  with 
protecting  its  members  personal  health.  Second,  NHLPA  members 
want  to  protect  the  competitive  integrity  and  fairness  of  their

sport.  And  third,  because  NHLPA  members  are  seen  by  young  as-
piring hockey players and fans around the world as important role 
models,  they  want  to  leave  no  doubt  about  their  opposition  to  per-
formance-enhancing substances. 

To  further  the  Committee  goal  today  to  obtain  information 
through  testimony  in  an  efficient  manner,  I  will  avoid  further  de-
scribing  details  of  our  new  program.  It  has  been  adequately  ex-
plained  by  Commissioner  Bettman,  I  support  everything  he  has 
said in describing our program. 

I  would,  however,  refer  you  to  our  written  submissions  which 
have  some  additional  background  on  that.  However,  I  think  it 
would  be  appropriate  to  make  just  a  few  comments  on  your  pro-
posed  legislation,  because—and  this  is  given  with  the  greatest  of 
respect  to  the  good  intentions  behind  the  legislation,  it  is  an  area 
in our view that is best left for individual sports leagues and play-
ers  associations  to  address  as  we  have  recently  done  through  our 
collective  bargaining  process,  particularly  so  that  the  specific  and 
different circumstances of each sport can be taken into account. 

There are a number of points I’ve detailed in my written submis-
sion from how to address frequency of testing when over 85 percent 
of  our  members  are  not  American  citizens  and  how  that  relates  to 
off-season testing. There are other points with respect to the actual 
list  of  prohibited  substances,  the  WADA  code,  which  we’ve  had 
much  experience  with  when  we  participate  in  the  Olympics,  has 
specific provisions for hockey, and you have to look at what is par-
ticular to hockey, which our program doctors have recently done in 
developing our program. 

On the therapeutic use exemptions, there is a reference to Amer-
ican  doctors  being  the  ones  who  have  to  provide  those  use  excep-
tions. With six clubs in Canada, and Canadian doctors, allowances 
would  have  to  be  made  so  that  Canadian  doctors  properly  reg-
istered  medical  practitioners  could  provide  those  therapeutic  use 
exemptions for Canadian players. 

In  short,  the  one-size-fits-all  aspect  of  the  legislation  would  be 
very problematic for hockey with the international nature and con-
stitution of our membership. 

Those are my comments, thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Saskin follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TED SASKIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL HOCKEY 

LEAGUE PLAYERS’ ASSOCIATION 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: 
My name is Ted Saskin and I serve as the Executive Director and General Coun-
sel  of  the  National  Hockey  League  Players’  Association  (NHLPA).  I  appreciate  the 
opportunity to provide this Committee with our perspective on the proposed S. 1114 
Clean  Sports  Act  of  2005  (S.  1114)  and  S.  1334  Professional  Sports  Integrity  and 
Accountability Act (S. 1334). 

Given  that  this  is  my  first  opportunity  to  appear  before  your  Committee,  I 
thought  it  would  be  useful  for  me  to  spend  a  few  minutes  providing  some  back-
ground  on  how  we  have  addressed  substance  abuse  and  the  use  of  steroids  and 
other  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  our  sport.  I  will  then  provide  my  comments 
on your proposed legislation. 

However,  before  I  address  those  two  matters  I  want  to  clearly  and  emphatically 
state to the Committee that the NHLPA membership, and officials in our organiza-
tion including myself, are strongly opposed to the use of performance-enhancing sub-
stances by anyone in our sport. There are three main reasons for this position. First, 
the  NHLPA  is  keenly  concerned  with  protecting  its  members’  personal  health.  Sec-

ond, NHLPA members want to protect the competitive integrity and fairness of their 
sport.  Third,  because  NHLPA  members  are  seen  by  young  aspiring  hockey  players 
and  fans  around  the  world  as  important  role  models,  they  want  to  leave  no  doubt 
about their opposition to performance-enhancing substances. 
NHLPA/NHL Performance-Enhancing Substances Program 

The  strong  commitment  of  the  NHLPA  membership  to  keep  hockey  free  of  per-
formance-enhancing  substances  is  best  evidenced  by  the  testing  program  that  was 
recently adopted as part of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between 
the  NHLPA  and  the  National  Hockey  League  (NHL).  The  performance-enhancing 
Substances Program (the Program), which went into effect with the execution of the 
CBA on July 15, 2005, is the first attempt to deal specifically with the issue of per-
formance-enhancing substances through a system of testing and discipline. It is my 
firm  belief  that  when  this  Program  is  fully  developed  and  operational,  it  will  serve 
as  an  effective  deterrent  to  the  use  of  performance-enhancing  substances.  The  Pro-
gram  features  a  comprehensive  educational  component,  the  prohibition  of  sub-
stances that would actually enhance performance in the sport of hockey and strong 
sanctions designed to rid the sport of these substances. We believe that by tailoring 
the  Program  to  the  specific  circumstances  of  professional  hockey,  including  the 
unique  realities  of  playing  in  the  NHL  and  the  international  nature  of  the  sport, 
we have significantly enhanced the Program’s effectiveness. 

To further the Committee’s goal today to obtain information through testimony in 
an efficient manner I will avoid further describing details of the Program’s purposes, 
design  and  operation.  Instead  I  will  refer  you  to  the  NHL’s  submission  on  the  Pro-
gram because I understand that information to be accurate. 
NHLPA/NHL Substance Abuse and Behavioural Health Program 

While the Program represents a dramatic and important new step in dealing with 
performance-enhancing  substances,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  NHLPA  and  the 
NHL have a long-standing commitment to addressing the issues of substance abuse 
and  the  use  of  performance-enhancing  substances.  In  1995,  in  conjunction  with  the 
negotiation  of  our  previous  CBA,  the  NHLPA  and  NHL  jointly  implemented  the 
‘‘NHL/NHLPA  Substance  Abuse  and  Behavioral  Health  Program  (SABH  Program). 
The SABH Program was broadly designed to address any potential substance abuse 
among NHL players and their families and to treat those problems in a confidential, 
fair and effective way. The SABH Program incorporates education, counseling, inpa-
tient  and  outpatient  treatment  and  testing,  follow-up  care  and,  where  appropriate, 
punitive sanctions, up to and including permanent suspension from play. 

Our  SABH  Program  has  worked  very  well  for  the  purposes  it  was  designed  for. 
Both the NHLPA and NHL have been pleased with its operation and results. How-
ever,  over  the  past  10  years,  and  particularly  in  recent  years,  the  issue  of  perform-
ance-enhancing  drugs  in  sport  has  become  more  prominent.  In  response  to  this 
change, our SABH Program Doctors developed and presented educational materials 
to  the  players  specifically  highlighting  the  dangers  of  steroid  use  in  at  least  4  of 
the last 7 years. Our SABH Program Doctors have confirmed to us that there is vir-
tually no steroid use in hockey, which is not surprising when one considers that the 
alleged benefits of such steroid use (enhanced bulk muscle mass) do not benefit elite 
hockey players. 

The  purported  benefits  of  steroid  use  are  simply  not  applicable  to  skilled  NHL 
players.  This  viewpoint  is  strongly  supported  by  the  fact  that  we  are  not  aware  of 
a single instance over the last 10 years in which an NHL player has tested positive 
for  performance-enhancing  drugs  during  any  of  the  many  International  Ice  Hockey 
competitions our players have participated in where there has been mandatory test-
ing. 

Specifically,  in  the  past  10  years,  hundreds  of  NHL  players  have  participated  in 
the  International  Ice  Hockey  Federation  World  Championships,  the  1998  and  2002 
Olympics and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey Competition. These NHL players were 
subject  to  the  drug  testing  protocols  in  connection  with  their  participation  in  these 
events.  These  protocols  utilized  a  substance  list  and  testing  procedures  equivalent 
to  the  current  WADA  Code.  We  are  aware  of  only  3  positive  tests  for  performance-
enhancing  drugs.  Of  these  3,  one  of  the  players  tested  positive  for  Salbutamol,  a 
drug  that  was  being  used  for  asthma  as  a  Proventil  inhaler  and  may  be  used  with 
a  therapeutic  use  exemption.  A  second  player  tested  positive  for  Tramadol,  a  sub-
stance  which  is  designated  as  an  ‘‘allowed  narcotic.’’  The  third  player  established 
a  ‘‘mistaken  use  defense’’  in  connection  with  his  use  of  over  the  counter  nutritional 
supplements. 

In short, we have been fortunate to have no issue to date with the use of perform-
ance-enhancing  drugs  by  elite  hockey  players.  Having  said  that,  I  can  give  this

Committee my complete assurance that our new Program is designed to prevent the 
use of performance-enhancing substances by any Players, however rare and isolated 
those cases may be. We fully recognize the importance of an effective Program. The 
players  I  represent  see  no  place  for  the  use  of  performance-enhancing  substances 
in our sport and are sensitive to their position as role models to many aspiring hock-
ey players and fans around the world. 
Comments  on  S.  1114,  The  Clean  Sports  Act  of  2005  and  S.  1334,  The

Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act 

My initial comment, which is given with the greatest of respect to the good inten-
tions behind the proposed legislation, is that this is an area that is best left for the 
individual  sports  leagues  and  player  associations  to  address  through  collective  bar-
gaining  so  that  the  specific  and  different  circumstances  of  each  sport  can  be  taken 
into  account.  We  believe  that  the  recently  adopted  NHLPA/NHL  Program  offers 
strong  support  for  the  proposition  that  collective  bargaining  is  the  appropriate  ave-
nue for producing effective and workable programs in professional sports. 

Now,  with  respect  to  the  specifics  of  the  proposed  legislation,  I  would  make  the 

following comments: 

Frequency of testing. Consistent with the NHL/NHLPA Program, both S. 1114 and 
S.  1334  provide  for  random,  no-notice  testing.  With  respect  to  testing  frequency, 
Section  4(b)(1)(A)  of  S.  1114  mandates  5  tests  in  each  calendar  year  that  a  player 
competes  and  Section  5(d)(1)(A)  of  S.  1334  mandates  3  such  tests.  These  require-
ments would not be practicable in our sport given the unique nature of hockey and 
the  way  Players  pass  in  and  out  of  the  League  over  the  course  of  a  season.  For  ex-
ample,  during  the  2003–04  season  there  were  1,433  Players  under  contract  to  an 
NHL  Club,  but  only  1,105  actually  competed  in  an  NHL  game.  Of  these  Players, 
32  played  in  only  one  game,  145  played  in  5  or  less  games  and  205  played  in  10 
or  less  games.  These  numbers  reflect  the  reality  that  Players  under  NHL  contract 
may  spend  the  entire  season  in  the  Minor  Leagues,  play  only  a  handful  of  NHL 
games  or  come  up  to  play  in  a  single  game  as  a  fill-in  before  flying  right  back  to 
the Minor League club the next day. It is difficult to see how a program mandating 
three  to  five  tests  for  such  Players  could  be  implemented.  It  is  with  this  reality  in 
mind that the NHLPA and NHL adopted a more flexible policy on frequency of test-
ing—a  policy  that  will  allow  regular  NHL  Players  to  be  tested  with  sufficient  fre-
quency to ensure the effectiveness of the Program. 

Timing of testing. With respect to timing, both pieces of proposed legislation man-
date testing during the off-season, with Section 4(b)(1)(B)(ii) of S. 1114 requiring at 
least  2  such  tests.  Once  again,  the  reality  of  NHL  hockey  would  render  these  re-
quirements unworkable. More than four fifths of NHL Players are from outside the 
United  States  and  many  of  these  Players  return  to  their  home  countries  in  the  off-
season, making year-round testing impracticable. In addition, we believe that timing 
parameters should take into account the scheduling difficulties faced by Players and 
Clubs. For example, it can often times take several hours to provide a urine sample 
after a player has become dehydrated following completion of a hockey game. Travel 
requirements  to  upcoming  games  will  often  require  that  players  leave  an  arena 
within one hour of completing a game to board a flight to their next city. The newly 
adopted  NHLPA/NHL  Program  prohibits  game  day  testing  in  recognition  of  these 
hockey-specific challenges. 

Prohibited  substances.  Section  4(b)  of  S.  1114  and  Section  5(b)  of  S.  1334  specify 
that the list of prohibited substances should be equivalent to the list established by 
the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA). It is our view that the list of sub-
stances  prohibited  in  the  NHL  should  be  developed  on  a  basis  that  is  relevant  to 
the  particular  sport  and  not  simply  by  adopting  the  list  formulated  by  USADA  or 
the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) for Olympic competitions. Some of the sub-
stances  prohibited  on  the  USADA/WADA  lists  are  not  performance-enhancing  and 
should not be included as part of any testing regimen governing hockey players. 

Penalties.  Section  4(b)(7)(A)(i)  of  S.  1114  and  Section  (5)(e)(1)(A)  of  S.  1334  con-
template  a  minimum  2  year  suspension  for  a  first  offense.  We  believe  that  2  years 
is  an  unreasonably  long  punishment  for  a  professional  hockey  player.  Unlike  the 
Olympics, which take place every 4 years, and are mainly a forum for amateur ath-
letes, the National Hockey League represents a career opportunity that can only be 
obtained  after  many  years  of  hard  work  and  a  substantial  amount  of  good  fortune. 
A  2-year  suspension  would  effectively  end  a  hockey  player’s  career,  stripping  him 
of  his  livelihood  on  the  basis  of  a  first  offence.  We  agree  that  meaningful  punish-
ment  is  an  important  part  of  any  testing  regimen  and  we  believe  that  our  recently 
adopted  Program  finds  the  correct  balance.  The  prescribed  20-game  suspension  for 
a  first-time  offender,  coupled  with  the  negative  public  coverage  such  an  individual 
will  receive,  will  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  offender’s  future  behavior  and  the 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  14:47 Aug 16, 2006 Jkt 028683 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\28683.TXT JACKF PsN: JACKF

49

behavior of all players. In addition, the 60-game suspension for a second offense and 
the  lifetime  ban  for  a  third  offense  are  very  substantial  penalties  that  should  oper-
ate to prevent repeat offenses. 

Public Disclosure. Both pieces of legislation call for public disclosure of an offend-
ing  player’s  identity  within  a  defined  time  period  from  the  date  of  a  positive  test 
or  notice  of  a  positive  test  (30  days  under  Section  4(b)(9)  of  S.  1114  and  10  days 
under Section 5(e)(2)(A) of S. 1334). We believe that in the interests of due process, 
no  disclosure  should  be  made  until  the  applicable  appeal  process  has  run  its  full 
course. A Player who is able to exonerate himself should not be subject to premature 
and possibly mistaken identification as an offender. 

Therapeutic  use  exemptions.  Both  pieces  of  proposed  legislation  provide  for  thera-
peutic  use  exemptions  (TUE’s),  which  are  also  an  important  component  of  the 
NHLPA/NHL  Program.  However,  Section  4(b)(4)  of  S.  1114  and  Section 
5(d)(3)(B)(iii)  of  S.  1334  require  that  the  substance  in  question  be  prescribed  by  a 
doctor licensed in the United States. This requirement would not be appropriate for 
the  NHL,  where  the  six  Clubs  based  in  Canada  employ  Canadian  doctors,  who  ad-
minister  to  mostly  Canadian  and  European  Players.  These  Players  should  be  able 
to seek TUE’s on the basis of their Canadian doctors’ prescriptions. Once again, we 
believe  that  the  collective  bargaining  process  provides  parties  with  the  ability  to 
achieve  the  same  goals  as  the  proposed  legislation,  but  in  a  manner  that  is  con-
sistent with the unique realities of their sports. 

To  close  I  want  to  again  share  the  NHLPA  members’  sentiment  that  they  want 
to do their part to maintain the public’s confidence that our sport is free of the use 
of performance-enhancing drugs. 

Thank you for inviting us to appear today.

Senator  MCCAIN.  Well,  Mr.  Saskin,  if  they  play  in  the  United 
States  of  America,  if  they’re  paid  in  the  United  States  of  America, 
and  it’s  Americans  that  patronize  their  games,  I  am  not  sympa-
thetic  to  some  problem  that  may  be  caused  by  the  fact  that  they 
live  overseas.  I  don’t  think  anyone  has  put  a  gun  to  their  heads 
and  asked  them,  or  forced  them  to  come  and  play  here.  If  they’re 
going to play in the United States of America, they should play by 
our rules. 

Mr. Fehr, you and I have known each other for many years, and 
we have been friends for many years. It was April 25th, more than 
5  months  ago  that  Commissioner  Selig  made  his  proposal.  More 
than  5  months  ago.  And  you  came  here  today  and  said  well,  we’re 
close  but  we  have  to  observe  the  Jewish  holidays  and  we  hope  to 
have an agreement by then. Are you and the players living in such 
a  rarified  atmosphere  that  you  do  not  appreciate  that  this  is  a 
transcendent issue. It was also intimated in your remarks that this 
is tied to other collective bargaining issues. Don’t you get it? Don’t 
you  get  it,  that  this  is  an  issue  which  is  greater  than  the  issue  of 
collective bargaining as I tried to say in my opening statement? It’s 
about  young  Americans  who  are  tempted  to  take  these  substances 
and some of them commit suicide. 

Don’t  you  understand  that  this  is  an  issue  of  such  transcendent 
importance  that  you  should  have  acted  months  ago?  There  should 
have been some agreement months ago. We wouldn’t be having this 
hearing I believe, the Palmiero case aside, if you had come to some 
agreement. The patience of this body, reflected by our constituents, 
is  at  an  end.  Now  could  you  give  me  a  definitive  date  when  you 
will  reach  a  final  agreement  with  Mr.  Selig,  not  associated  with 
any other collective bargaining issue? 

Mr.  FEHR.  A  number  of  things,  Mr.  Chairman.  First  of  all,  we 
have known each other and been friends for many years, and I cer-
tainly hope that will continue.

Second,  our  bargaining  is  not  tied  to  other  issues  if  I  inadvert-
ently made that suggestion that was incorrect and I was not speak-
ing  precisely.  I  was  referring  to  a  process  of  bargaining  in  prior 
years,  and  criticism  about  whether  we  said  things  publicly  or 
whether we didn’t, with the press around the negotiations. 

Third,  after  the  hearings  on  the  House  side  in  March,  and  after 
receiving the Commissioner’s letter, we had discussions both before 
and  after  that.  There  was  an  agreement  at  the  beginning  that  it 
would  be  unfair  to  have  a  change  in  the  middle  of  the  season. 
That’s  why  the  Commissioner  had  the  Minor  League  changes  take 
effect in 2006. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Did  that  preclude  you  from  reaching  an  agree-

ment? 

Mr.  FEHR.  No,  no.  Let  me  finish  Mr.  Chairman,  please.  I  then 
went—sent  the  tapes  of  the  hearings  to  all  of  the  players  and  I 
have  an  obligation  to  meet  with  them  all.  Which  I  did.  It  was  al-
ways  known  and  understood  that  we  would  get  back  to  it.  There 
were  ongoing  discussions  all  summer  long.  And  although  more  in-
tensively after my meetings with the players ended. Now in answer 
to  your  specific  question  about  a  time  deadline.  Can  I  give  you  a 
precise  date,  no.  Do  I  expect  to  know  within  the  reasonably  near 
future  whether  that  will  done,  yes.  Would  I  expect  it  to  be  by  the 
end of the World Series, I would certainly hope so. 

Senator MCCAIN. Well, the last thing that the Senator from Ken-
tucky and I and members of this Committee want to do, is pass leg-
islation.  But  we’re  at  the  end  of  the  line,  Mr.  Fehr.  We’re  at  the 
end  of  the  line  here.  How  many  more  Rafael  Palmieros  are  there 
going to be? How many statements by David Wells saying that ‘‘I’m 
sure that there are still plenty of guys in this game using steroids?’’ 
We’re  at  the  end  here,  and  I  don’t  want  to  do  it,  but  we  need  an 
agreement and we need it soon. It’s not complicated. All sports fans 
understand it. So I would, in all due respect to the Jewish holidays, 
or any other logistical problems you might have, I suggest you act, 
and act soon. 

Commissioner  Tagliabue,  there  was  a  program  called  ‘‘Costas 
Now’’  on  HBO.  On  August  12,  2005,  they  interviewed  Dr.  James 
Shortt. Dr. James Shortt said that he gave a number of NFL play-
ers  anabolic  steroids  according  to  Arman  Keteyian,  who  was  the 
one who interviewed him. ‘‘The NFL laws are such that it’s prohib-
ited to take anabolic steroids while you’re playing in the NFL. Are 
you aware of that?’’ ‘‘Yes, absolutely.’’ ‘‘But were you aware of it at 
the  time  were  you  prescribing  anabolic  steroids  to  NFL  players?’’ 
‘‘Possibly  at  some  point.’’  ‘‘How  many  NFL  players  did  you  work 
with?’’  ‘‘Let’s  say  one  to  two  dozen.’’  Arman  Keteyian  says,  ‘‘I’ve 
heard  18,  Dr.  Shortt.’’  ‘‘That  would  be  somewhere  in  that  range. 
(Smile.)’’  If  that’s  true  why  haven’t  we  had  some  detection  of  this 
kind of anabolic steroid use, Commissioner? 

Commissioner  TAGLIABUE.  Well,  those  players,  Mr.  Chairman, 
were  engaged  in  a  course  of  conduct  to  evade  detection.  This  is  a 
unique  substance,  testosterone,  it’s  a  naturally  appearing  sub-
stance,  with  a  very  complicated  test.  And  they  were  staying  under 
the  radar  screen,  in  effect.  And  we  have  a  report  on  this,  a  com-
prehensive  report  done  by  our  investigators.  We’d  be  glad  to  give

it to you. Dr. Shortt has now been indicted. We are now addressing 
the other issue that comes up in that situation which is——

Senator  MCCAIN.  Including  the  players  that  were  implicated  in 
BALCO. There were a number of baseball players that were impli-
cated there as well. 

Commissioner TAGLIABUE. You mean football? 
Senator MCCAIN. I mean football players. 
Commissioner  TAGLIABUE.  Yes,  that  was  a  substance  for  which 
there  was  no  test  known  at  the  time.  As  soon  as  the  test  was 
known,  we  applied  the  test  not  only  to  current  players,  but  to  one 
year’s  worth  of  samples,  I  believe  that  we  had  been  holding  from 
the  prior  year  and  we  found  no  other  violations  of  that  THG  sub-
stance.  We  were  very  aggressive  there  in  going  back  to  tests  that 
were taken, I believe, as long as a year earlier. 

Senator MCCAIN. Senator Bunning. 
Senator  BUNNING.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  First  of  all,  if  you 
wonder  why  we’re  really  pushing  this,  this  letter  will  indicate  to 
you  why.  This  is  from  a  Boy  Scout,  from  the  State  of  Kentucky. 
‘‘My  name  is  Joseph  Mattingly.  I  am  a  Boy  Scout  from  Troop  327. 
At  this  year’s  summer  camp,  I  am  working  on  a  merit  badge  that 
requires me to write a letter to a Member of Congress, representing 
my state, Kentucky. This letter was required to be about a national 
issue which I share the same view with you. I wrote to you because 
I  am  a  fan  of  Major  League  Baseball  and  would  agree  that  Con-
gress  should  get  involved  in  the  steroids  scandal.  I  say  this  for 
many reasons. One is that Major League Baseball needs some help. 
If they can’t clear up this problem, Congress could. Another reason 
is  that  taking  performance-enhancing  drugs  is  cheating.  Cheating 
should  not  be  the  American  way  of  doing  things.  A  third  reason  is 
that  steroids  are  drugs.  Performance-enhancing  drugs  should  be 
made illegal without a prescription.’’ And then it goes into the Hall 
of  Fame  and  things  like  that.  That’s  the  reason  that  we’re  here 
today.  Whether  you  like  it,  or  whether  you  don’t  like  it.  Now,  Don 
Fehr, I’ve known you for longer than John McCain has. 

Mr.  FEHR.  That’s  certainly  correct,  probably  about  a  decade 

Senator  BUNNING.  Now  do  you  believe  that  there  is  a  problem 

with steroids and amphetamines in baseball? 

Mr. FEHR. I believe with respect to steroids that there has been, 
the data we compiled in 2003 demonstrated that. I believe it is well 
on  the  way  to  being  eradicated.  And  I  think  that  the  agreement 
that I hope to be able to reach and that I’m certain that the players 
will ratify will make that beyond question. 

Senator  BUNNING.  Do  you  think  players  who  use  steroids  are 

longer. 

cheaters? 

Mr. FEHR. I was asked and answered that question affirmatively 

at the Government Reform Hearing last month. 

Senator  BUNNING.  Do  you  think  cheaters  should  be  allowed  to 

stay in the game? 

Mr. FEHR. I think that with respect to penalties, two things have 
to  apply.  That  you  have  to  look  at  the  facts  and  circumstances  of 
every  case.  You  have  to  make  a  judgment  as  to  what  level  of  pen-
alty  should  be  applied  in  every  case,  and  the  players  should  have

you——

an opportunity to tell his story if he thinks there are mitigating cir-
cumstances——

Senator BUNNING. Even though they test positive? 
Mr.  FEHR.  Yes.  And  that’s—and  I  don’t  understand  Senator  one 
thing,  with  respect  to  a  lot  of  the  criticism.  It’s  traditional  in  this 
country that when someone is accused of something that they have 
an  opportunity  to  tell  their  story,  to  a  neutral.  To  somebody 
who’s——

Senator BUNNING. That’s why an independent——
Mr.  FEHR.  That’s  right,  to  a  neutral,  to  an  independent.  And  to 
say, this is why you shouldn’t find that I did whatever it is they’re 
accused  of  and  if  you  find  that  I  do,  this  is  why  it  shouldn’t  be 
treated as seriously as you otherwise might. And the prosecutor, or 
in  our  business,  the  clubs,  the  Commissioner’s  office  would  cer-
tainly  have  the  right  to  say,  well  that  evidence  isn’t  very  persua-
sive,  but  not  only  that,  we  think  the  penalties  ought  to  be  in-
creased  beyond  the  presumptive  penalty.  And  the  structure  we’ve 
proposed, does that. 

Senator BUNNING. Let me ask both of you, Comissioner Fehr and 

Mr. FEHR. I don’t quite have the title, but thank you. 
Senator BUNNING. Commissioner Selig, and you, Don. It’s obvious 
to  everyone  in  this  room  that  baseball  and  the  players  only  act 
when Congress threatens you. Unless we hit you, you don’t do any-
thing. So why should we believe you’re serious now, instead of just 
passing  a  new  law  and  making  a  meaningful  drug  test  for  your 
players and for the integrity of baseball. 

Mr. FEHR. Let me respond first, since it was directed at the play-
ers, I think. And I would say two things. First of all we’ve renegoti-
ated  a  number  of  times  in  response  to  specific  criticisms  and  to 
changing events and we’re in the process of doing it again. Second, 
within  the  reasonably  forseeable  future,  I  believe  we  will  have  a 
new  agreement  and  that  can  be  judged  on  it’s  own  merits.  Third, 
in  the  end,  you  and  your  colleagues,  and  your  colleagues  in  the 
House will make a decision as to whether or not its sufficient. Part 
of  the  reason,  although  far  from  the  only  reason  that  I  went  to 
meet with the players this summer was to explain to them, and to 
every one of them individually that wanted to come to the meetings 
exactly what the reaction——

Senator  BUNNING.  Do  they  understand  how  serious  a  problem  it 

is in the public? 

Mr.  FEHR.  I  think  they  do,  although  as  you  know  like  with  any 

Senator  BUNNING.  You’re  taking  all  my  time,  and  I  don’t  have 

group——

time. 

Mr. FEHR. I apologize. 
Senator BUNNING. That’s OK. 
Mr. FEHR. I apologize. 
Senator  BUNNING.  But  in  your  written  statement,  your  legalese 
in your written statement, there are serious questions as to wheth-
er the bills before the Committee are consistent with the Constitu-
tion. And then you cite Chandler versus Miller, a case in which the 
Supreme  Court  held  unconstitutional  as  a  violation  of  the  Fourth

Amendment.  I  think  that’s  very  interesting.  Commissioner,  would 
you like to answer that? 

Commissioner  SELIG.  Thank  you,  Senator  Bunning,  I  would. 
There’s  no  question  that  from  the  late  1990s  when  I  began  to  be-
lieve that there was a problem I think we did everything we could, 
and  I  know  people  have  said  that  we’ve  been  slow  to  react  and 
that’s  a  fair  criticism.  Although,  as  I  look  back  retrospectively,  I’m 
not  sure  there’s  any  more  we  could  have  done.  The  Minor  League 
program is now five years old. We’re testing all over everywhere we 
can.  In  2002  we  got  the  first  drug  testing  program  the  sport  had 
ever had, albeit not strong enough. And I made a conscientious de-
cision  at  that  time  at  6:30  in  the  morning  that  the  sport  couldn’t 
take  another  lockout  or  strike.  And  while  I  wanted  a  tougher  pro-
gram,  it  wasn’t  there.  There’s  no  question  that  I  wish  we  were  in 
a  different  position  than  we’re  in  today.  I’ve  meant  what  I’ve  said 
here,  I’ve  said  it  all  over  the  country.  I  think  Senator  Cantwell 
heard me say this in Seattle. This is an integrity issue. 

Senator  BUNNING.  You’ll  have  a  chance  to  prove  yourself  by  the 

end of the World Series according to the Director. 

Commissioner  SELIG.  Well,  you  know  I  have  been  as  everybody 
around me knows very restless, it’s been five months. Some people 
have  even  been  critical  that  these  penalties  aren’t  severe.  But  I 
think they fit our sport. I really do. I think the independent testing 
is important. Frankly I’m anxious to get our people out of it. There 
should  never  be  a  scintilla  of  doubt  whether  the  program  is  work-
ing—I’ve said this many times but just sitting here again, just the 
fact  that  we’re  sitting  here  and  discussing  this,  we  need  to  have 
tougher  penalties,  independent  testings,  so  we  have  established 
once and for all that we are really serious about this. 

Senator MCCAIN. Senator Dorgan. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  Mr.  Fehr,  you  ap-
peared  at  the  hearing  I  chaired  in  2002,  and  many  of  the  same 
points  of  discussion  occurred  then,  and  I  indicated  in  my  opening 
statement  I  think  obviously  there’s  been  some  progress.  But  Mr. 
Fehr,  you  still  speak  as  if  this  is  negotiable.  I  submit,  that  if  you 
listen  carefully  to  Senator  McCain’s  opening  statement  and  other 
statements  from  the  House  and  Senate,  I  think  this  is  non-nego-
tiable at this point. I think you waited too long. 

And  by  that  I  simply  mean  that  we’ve  gone  way  past  the  point 
now  of  no  return.  It’s  quite  clear,  Congress  is  simply  going  to  slap 
on  a  routine  here,  or  an  approach  to  testing,  and  penalties  unless 
the Commissioner and you do it first, and so you might respond to 
this, but you still sound this morning as if this is something that’s 
part of your negotiation. I submit, I think it’s non-negotiable at this 
point. 

Mr.  FEHR.  Senator,  first  of  all  I  appreciate  your  comments  and 
the  sense  of  the  hearings  that  you’ve  referred  to.  Some  other  ones 
on  the  House  side  have  been  conveyed  to  the  players,  it’s  part  of 
what  I  did.  In  some  fashion  when  tapes  are  available  of  this  hear-
ing, I’m going to make those available to the players too, although 
it  will  be  the  off-season  and  a  little  more  difficult  to  reach  every-
body. I think that the majority of the players understand what the 
sense  of  the  Congress  is,  I  can’t  speak  for  every  single  one,  but 
that’s  my  sense  meeting  with  them.  That’s  why  we’re  engaged  in

this process. And when I use the term negotiation, what I mean by 
it  is  this.  My  obligation  as  a  representative  of  the  players,  both 
generally  and  under  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act,  is  to  nego-
tiate  on  their  behalf  what  they  believe  to  be  an  appropriate  and 
fair agreement under all circumstances, and that’s what I’m trying 
to do. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  then,  perhaps  I  was  too  personal.  Maybe 
it’s  just  the  message  to  the  players,  that  they’ve  waited  too  long. 
They’ve  waited  too  long.  It’s  over.  I  mean  this  is  not  in  my  judg-
ment  negotiable.  And  I  think  that  Chairman  McCain  and  others 
have  made  that  point.  Let  me  just  ask  Commissioner  Selig.  As  I 
understand  it,  you  have  a  Minor  League  program  that  you  put  in 
place. 

Commissioner SELIG. Yes, that is correct. 
Senator DORGAN. And tell me about that program, just a thumb-

nail sketch very quickly. 

Commissioner  SELIG.  We  put  it  in  effect  in  2001,  and  it  has 
worked well. I’ve toughened the penalties up once I began to really 
understand  the  dimension  of  the  integrity  problem.  So  next  year 
the very penalties that I’m asking the Major League Players Asso-
ciation  to  do,  are  in  effect  in  the  Minor  Leagues  and  everybody  is 
tested. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Why  did  you  put  that  in  place  in  2001,  in  the 

Minor Leagues? 

Commissioner  SELIG.  Because  I  was  very  concerned,  I  thought 

that baseball already had a very significant problem. 

Senator  DORGAN.  And  you  had  the  authority  unilaterally  to  do 

that in 2001? 

it. 

Commissioner  SELIG.  I  did  have  the  authority  to  unilaterally  do 

Senator DORGAN. Minor League only? 
Commissioner SELIG. In the Minor Leagues, yes Senator. 
Senator  DORGAN.  And  did  you  propose  that  to  the  Major  League 

Ball Players in the——

Commissioner  SELIG.  It  was  the  last  very  contentious  issue  in 
the  2002  negotiation  and  I,  of  course,  yes,  I  was  very  hopeful  we 
could do that. But as I said to Senator Bunning, I made a decision, 
which  I  think  I  would  make  again  as  tough  as  it  was,  that  we 
couldn’t get that program. We got the first testing program, but ob-
viously it didn’t have the same teeth, and it wasn’t able to produce 
what we know we must pursue. 

Senator DORGAN. If you could have imposed it unilaterally as you 
did for the Minor Leagues, would you have for the Major Leagues? 

Commissioner SELIG. Oh, of course I would have, absolutely. 
Senator DORGAN. Same program? 
Commissioner SELIG. Same program absolutely. 
Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, you know this is the third hear-
ing we’ve had and frankly, with all sports I think we had some pe-
diatric  physicians  testify  at  the  first  hearing,  talking  about  12,  13, 
14 year old kids that are out looking for things that will build their 
bodies  and  enhance  their  performance.  Why?  Because  they  read 
about others doing it. So this has a profound influence in our coun-
try,  the  issue  of  drugs  and  sports.  And  I  know  some  of  the  other 
professional sports have taken great strides. Mr. Upshaw made the

point that I’d written down somewhere that the football players be-
lieve  taking  these  drugs  is  cheating  and  they  want  cheaters  out  of 
football. 

I would assume that baseball players would feel exactly the same 
way  and  if  they  don’t,  I’m  surprised.  If  they  do  feel  the  same  way, 
it’s strange that we haven’t gotten to the point where this is solved, 
so that you don’t have to come to the Congress about it, or that we 
don’t have to call you in. 

Mr. FEHR. Would you like me to respond? 
Senator DORGAN. Yes I’d be happy to. 
Mr. FEHR. Thank you, Senator. A couple of things, first of all, the 
players  of  course  feel  that  way,  they  always  have.  That’s  why  we 
have been engaged in this process. That’s why I was given the au-
thority  to  enter  into  the  negotiations.  I  don’t  have  that  authority 
on my own. 

Senator  DORGAN.  But  you  see  my  point,  sorry  for  interrupting 
you,  but  now  you’re  talking  about  your  negotiations.  My  point  is, 
I  think  its  over.  So  you’re  still  negotiating  on  what  this  might  be. 
I  think  the  Commissioner  and  the  owners  have  told  you  what  it 
has  to  be,  the  Congress  has  told  you  what  it  has  to  be,  and  you’re 
still negotiating. That’s why I think the game is up here. I’m sorry 
to interrupt you. 

Mr. FEHR. Senator, I will certainly convey your feelings as I have 
in  the  past  and  your  colleagues  in  the  House,  and  the  other  mem-
bers  of  this  body.  That’s  something  that  I  not  only  do  I  have  an 
obligation  to  do,  but  is  very  important  to  do.  And  very  important 
for everybody to understand. 

As I indicated in my opening statement. I think we’re very close 
to  an  agreement.  I’ll  be  surprised  if  we  can’t  work  it  out.  You’ll  be 
in  a  position  to  make  judgment  as  to  the  appropriate  role  of  the 
Congress when you see the results of that. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  as  my  final  comment  let  me 
just say that I am thrilled as a young boy from a town of 300 peo-
ple to see these Hall of Famers here today. And I hope every base-
ball player in America, every baseball player in America, from little 
kids  on  up  to  the  Major  Leagues  will  understand  what  they  said. 
This  is  an  important  and  really  interesting  national  pastime.  It’s 
a  wonderful  game.  They  said  it  very  clearly.  The  first  five  state-
ments  made  to  this  Committee  said  it  all.  And  I  hope  everyone 
takes notice of that. 

Senator MCCAIN. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator Allen. 
Senator  ALLEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  commend 
the  NBA,  and  the  NHL  for  your  recent  strong  action  against  and 
putting in a program to combat drugs, the NHL in particular in the 
midst  of  all  sorts  of  other  negotiations.  The  model,  if  you  look  at 
past  performance,  is  the  National  Football  League  and  the  joint 
statement  of  Mr.  Upshaw  and  Mr.  Tagliabue  points  that  out.  As  I 
understand  it,  and  I’ll  address  you,  too,  Mr.  Upshaw  and  Commis-
sioner  Tagliabue,  as  I  understand  it,  the  NFL  banned  Andro,  they 
banned Ephedra, before the FTC, before the Office of Drug Control 
Policy, before the FDA, or most recently we passed a law last year, 
which  I’ve  co-sponsored  on  Ephedra,  but  you  did  that  before  Con-
gress, or all these agencies acted. And isn’t that true?

Commissioner TAGLIABUE. Yes, we banned Andro seven years be-
fore  it  was  banned  by  the  Federal  Government.  We  banned 
Ephedra years before it was banned by anybody else, and we have 
maintained our ban in light of Federal court rulings that have chal-
lenged  the  FDA’s  ban.  So  we  have  been  very  proactive  in  those 
areas and others. 

Senator  ALLEN.  In  your  testimony,  your  joint  testimony,  you 
talked  about  this  legislation  that  in  this  legislation  could  actually 
lower  the  standards  in  the  NFL  and  reduce  the  effectiveness  of 
your  drug  program,  could  you  elaborate  specifically  how  this  legis-
lation could weaken it. 

Commissioner  TAGLIABUE.  Well,  I  feel  as  I  said  earlier,  that  the 
strict liability approach is very important here. And a player is re-
sponsible  for  anything  in  his  body.  And  any  approach  which  gets 
into  I  didn’t  know,  I  didn’t  intend,  I  was  told  otherwise,  I  felt  the 
doctor was reliable, fill in the blank, is very problematic. I’ve been 
in  hearings  over  the  years  where  it  was  my  sister  the  registered 
nurse  who  doped  the  NyQuil  or  it  was  my  girlfriend  who  put  the 
Ephedra in my beer. It was this guy who came into my apartment 
to  rob  my  stereo  who  put  the  Andro  in  my  Wheaties.  You  can’t 
have  that.  And  I  notice  that  Commissioner  Stern  referred  to  their 
program as a strict liability program and that’s what our standard 
is,  you  are  charged  with  knowing  its  wrong.  Kids  know  it’s  wrong, 
high school coaches know it’s wrong, college people know it’s wrong. 
You’re  obligated  as  an  NFL  player  getting  paid  hundreds  of  thou-
sands  of  dollars  a  year  to  know  it’s  wrong.  And  that’s  what  are 
penalties  are  geared  to,  and  I  think  that  is  the  most  effective  ap-
proach and I think we can mesh our approach with the legislation. 
And  that’s  why  we’ve  suggested  that  a  program  like  ours  could  be 
certified  hopefully  if  it  served  all  of  the  purposes,  even  though 
maybe every individual element might not be exactly the same. But 
we  are  comfortable  with  this  legislation  on  the  basis  set  forth  in 
our statement. 

Senator  ALLEN.  Your  statement,  Mr.  Upshaw,  your  joint  state-
ment said a concept, I assume it would be like what we’ve done in 
welfare  reform,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  set  certain  standards  and  states 
meet  it  and  they’re  certified,  so  they  do  their  own  approach  and 
those  who  do  not  meet  the  standard  would  be  under  the  Federal 
laws  and  dictates.  Is  that  your  understanding  of  not  wanting  to 
lower your standards, because you all feel in the NFL that you ex-
ceed what’s in this legislation? 

Mr.  UPSHAW.  I  think  our  statement  points  that  out,  that  we 
would  be  very  comfortable  with  a  certification  procedure  that  al-
lowed  us  to  continue  doing  what  we  do,  because  we  strongly  feel 
that  it’s  working.  So  if  we  met  all  of  the  standards,  we  should  be 
able to be certified out of it. 

Senator ALLEN. I heard your motivation previously and why you 
all  wanted  to  act,  let  me  finish  off  here  with  Mr.  Fehr,  and  Major 
League  Baseball,  and  this  is  the  main  reason  that  we’re  here  and 
looking  at  legislation.  We’ve  heard  from  the  NFL  and  others  and 
why  they  want  to  do  this,  their  motivations  in  a  variety  of  ways 
of  acting  before  Congress  acts.  I  read  on  page  five  of  your  testi-
mony  you  say  that  you’ve  now  banned—one  reason  that  you  wait-
ed, is that there were perfectly legal substances until last January,

now  illegal  as  a  result  of  the  passage  of  the  Anabolic  Steroid  Con-
trol  Act  of  2004.  And  before  then  they  were  legal,  and  then  they 
were  illegal,  and  then  you  banned  them.  Note  what  Mr.  Upshaw 
was  working  with  Mr.  Tagliabue,  Commissioner  Tagliabue  have 
done. For the sake of the players health—in other words their point 
is  they  didn’t  wait  for  Congress,  or  the  Federal  Drug  Administra-
tion to act, they realized that it was not a level playing field it was 
cheating,  they  banned  it.  Now  for  the  sake  of  the  health  of  the 
players,  for  the  integrity  of  the  game,  the  message  it  sends  to 
young people, and there’s a matter of your attitude and motivation, 
Mr. Fehr? Why can’t you be more like Gene Upshaw? 

Mr.  FEHR.  Well,  let  me  say  a  couple  of  things.  First  of  all,  I 
would love to have been able to play any sport at the level that he 
did. 

Senator ALLEN. I was saying attitude and motivation, I don’t ex-

pect you to be an offensive tackle. 

Mr.  FEHR.  I  grew  up  in  Kansas  City,  Senator,  and  Mr.  Upshaw 
had the pleasure I’m sure from his standpoint, of making my root-
ing  for  the  Kansas  City  Chiefs  miserable  on  numerous  occasions, 
and  so  I  am  very  familiar  with  him,  both  before  and  now.  Let  me 
just say two things about what you’ve said. First of all, given what 
has  transpired,  would  we  have  made  the  same  judgments  retro-
spectively  about  Androstenedione  that  were  made  at  the  time,  I’m 
not  sure.  But  I  think  there  is  a  respectable  and  important  argu-
ment  that  a  lot  of  players  felt  should  be  seriously  considered.  And 
I  just  basically  want  to  mention  what  it  is.  It  was  that  if  the  Con-
gress of the United States and the appropriate Federal agencies in 
their wisdom say that Androstenedione is perfectly legal, that any-
one  can  go  into  the  store  and  buy  it.  There  isn’t  even  an  age  re-
striction on it. Then the question becomes, should someone because 
he’s  employed  in  this  particular  industry  be  prohibited  from  doing 
that which any other person in the country could do. You may dis-
agree  with  it,  as  I  said  in  retrospect  I’m  not  sure  we  would  have 
the same view, but I don’t think it’s an inappropriate view. One of 
the things that I liked very much——
Senator MCCAIN. Senator Cantwell. 
Mr. FEHR. I apologize, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Fehr,  that, 
I’ve read your letter, I’ve read it several times. It seems to me that 
Major  League  Baseball  has  gotten  the  message.  But  the  players 
union  hasn’t.  And  when  I  read  your  letter  I  don’t  think  you’re  so 
close to an agreement. It seems to me that Major League Baseball 
is  saying  clearly,  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out.’’  You’re  saying 
‘‘three strikes and you might be safe.’’

Mr. FEHR. No, I don’t think that’s right. 
Senator CANTWELL. Can I finish? 
Mr. FEHR. I apologize. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  My  colleagues  here,  on  the  Committee  and 
other  committees  are  saying  it  should  be  two  strikes  and  you’re 
out. If you go to the individual issues at debate here, first time of-
fense, Major League Baseball is saying 50-game ban. You want less 
than  that,  a  20-game  ban.  My  colleagues  are  saying  2  years.  You 
go  to  the  second  time,  again  Major  League  Baseball  has  a  100-
game  ban,  again  my  colleagues  here  are  saying  that’s  it.  You’re

done.  So  to  me  it  seems  like  you  are  at  a  much  different  place.  It 
seems  like  Major  League  Baseball  said  we’re  serious  about  this, 
and  they  went  out  and  got  serious  about  it  in  this  proposal.  This 
response that we just got, I’m assuming it just came out in the last 
couple  of  days.  So  we  had  5  months  of  not  hearing  a  lot,  now  we 
have  this  proposal.  And  so  I  don’t  get  it—I  don’t  understand  what 
is  your  sticking  point  about  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out.’’  I  don’t 
understand how you want to carve something out, that guess what, 
you  might  have  violated  it,  but  now  you  can  stay  in  Major  League 
Baseball,  because  the  whole  point  here  is  a  zero-tolerance  policy 
that we want to get to. And it’s very hard to get to a zero-tolerance 
policy.  You  can’t  have  one  and  16  teenagers  using  illegal  steroids 
and  say  that  the  Major  League  Baseball  philosophy  is  ‘‘three 
strikes and you still might be able to play baseball.’’

Mr. FEHR. Let me try and respond succinctly. I don’t want to re-
spond  to  everything  you  said.  I’m  sure  that  would  be  far  too  long 
for  purposes  of  this  hearing.  But  I’ll  be  glad  to  talk  with  you  at  a 
later  time  if  you  would  hope,  or  if  you  would  like  me  to.  Basically 
we  have  accepted  the  framework  of  ‘‘three  strikes  and  you’re  out.’’ 
Our proposal is and this is not—because the specific proposal is not 
reflected  in  that  letter.  Our  proposal  on  the  table  at  the  moment 
is——

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  this  letter  that  just  came  out  on  Sep-

tember 26th, does not reflect the current proposal? 

Mr.  FEHR.  That  letter  was  a  summary  of  bargaining  positions 
that have been taken over the summer. As I indicated in my open-
ing  statement,  the  current  proposals  on  the  table  are  these,  for  a 
third violation the Commissioner may impose whatever penalty he 
believes  is  appropriate,  that  the  facts  and  circumstances  justify. 
Provided  it’s  reviewed,  the  player  has  an  opportunity  to  tell  his 
story  and  indicate  why  he  believes  it  shouldn’t  be,  and  that  in-
cludes  permanent  ineligibility.  The  difference  between  us  at  the 
moment  is  this.  The  Commissioner  believes  that  an  arbitrator 
should not be able to reduce the penalty below 2 years, our position 
is  that  the  arbitrator  should  not  be  able  to  reduce  it  below  1  year. 
One  year  for  a  third  violation  is  the  penalty  in  some  of  the  other 
sports that you have heard today. 

When  I  indicated  in  my  opening  statement  that  I  thought  we 
were  very  close  to  an  agreement,  I  think  that’s  an  indication  of  it. 
Senator CANTWELL. Mr. Selig, does that sound like an agreement 
to  you?  It  seems  to  me  if  the  primary  premise  here  is  to  say  that 
we’re  going  to  have  a  zero  tolerance,  and  your  third  time  of  using 
a  substance  that  is  banned  you’re  supposed  to  gone  from  Major 
League  Baseball,  it’s  pretty  hard  to  say,  well  you  know  what  we’ll 
have  somebody  and  they  can  decide  at  their  discretion.  Those  are 
two different approaches. 

Commissioner  SELIG.  Well,  Senator  Cantwell,  as  you  know,  I 
have  been  very  specific  all  over  this  country  in  the  last  5  months 
about  my  proposal  and  I  really  believe—it  is  that.  Thus  50  games, 
100  games,  and  life.  And  anything  less  than  that  I  don’t  believe 
deals  with  the  integrity  problem  of  the  sport  which  I’ve  described 
before.  The  independent  testing,  it  also  cleans  up  that.  But  the 
penalties have to be severe enough, not because I don’t believe the 
current program is working. I think we’ve established that. But for

people  to  understand  that  we  really  get  it.  And  that  this  is  an  in-
tegrity question, and as far as I’m concerned this and I’ve said this 
to our own people and I’ve said it to the owners who are very sup-
portive, there’s no dissent at all. One of the few subjects in my long 
tenure  where  there’s  no  dissent,  that  it’s  50,  100  and  life.  And 
that’s exactly what it is. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, I may have a little chip on my shoulder 
because  when  I  get  up  in  the  morning  I  can’t  always  find  the  Se-
attle Mariners sports scores. But I can tell you that we’ve had some 
very  positive  sports  news  in  the  Northwest,  when  Ichiro  broke  an 
84-year  single  hit  record,  and  we  retired  a  Seattle  Mariner  who 
spent  his  entire  life,  not  shopping  around  for  higher  salaries,  but 
his  entire  life  playing  for  the  Seattle  Mariners,  Edgar  Martinez, 
and  had  a  very  great  career,  a  seven  time  all-star  who  won  two 
batting  titles.  But  those  stories  don’t  get  coverage,  this  story  is 
what gets coverage. It’s very frustrating that we’re not moving fast-
er. And I’d love to see Mr. Fehr, your latest, but I just have a feel-
ing  that  you’re  a  lot  farther  apart  on  this  than  your  letter  or  even 
your testimony will acknowledge today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. FEHR. Well, I hope that turns out not to be true. 
Senator MCCAIN. Senator Lautenberg. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thanks,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  hope  that 
something  I  might  ask  not  be  redundant  and  if  it  is  please  call  it 
to  my  attention  so  we  don’t  waste  any  time.  Mr.  Fehr,  there  used 
to  be  an  old  song,  ‘‘I  Stand  Alone.’’  You  obviously  are  standing 
alone  in  the  face  of  what  looks  like  an  easy  one  for  me.  Because 
your  resistance  suggests  that  well,  this  isn’t  so  severe  after  all.  I 
mean  the  problem  isn’t  really  that  violent.  That  it  scares  all  of  us 
who  worry  about  the  future  generations  and  about  the  sport  that 
all of us are committed to. I’m old enough that I’d be embarrassed 
to tell you the players that I knew in my day. One of them I went 
to  high  school  with  was  Larry  Dobie,  from  Patterson  and  he’s  a 
great  hero.  But  so  why  is  there  any  resistance?  This  sounds  like 
a  reasonable  thing.  It’s  punishment  fits  the  crime,  period.  And 
rather than ask the Commissioner of Baseball, whoever that might 
be  at  the  time,  to  levy  a  punishment,  how  does  the  Commissioner 
feel when, if he’s got a hitter who’s broken all the records, and has 
his team up on the edge, why shouldn’t it be a pro forma, perfunc-
tory  kind  of  thing  that  says,  that’s  it,  brother,  there’s  no  question 
about it. 

Mr. FEHR. Let me just say a couple of things in response to that, 
and  try  and  articulate  our  position.  I’ll  try  again  not  to  repeat  my 
prior comments also. I’m mindful of your suggestions about redun-
dancy.  Fundamentally  we  believe  this.  That  where  someone  is  ac-
cused of wrongdoing there needs to be an examination of what hap-
pened.  Not  generally,  not  in  the  abstract,  but  in  the  individual 
case.  And  we  believe  you  should  have  a  presumptive  penalty. 
That’s  our  proposal  and  that  structure  is  the  one  the  Commis-
sioner’s  office  is  working  with.  But  that  if  the  player  can  dem-
onstrate  to  an  arbitrator,  that  you  know  in  my  circumstance  there 
are  things  which  you  don’t  know,  which  aren’t  apparent,  which  I 
think ought to influence a decision, could be reduced a little bit. If 
the  Commissioner  believes  there  are  things  which  aggravate  it,  it 
could  be  increased.  In  terms  of  the  other  sports  and  in  standing

if I may? 

alone, let me just say as follows: I think if you look at the penalty 
levels  under  our  proposal,  putting  aside  the  Commissioner’s  pro-
posal  for  a  moment  I  don’t  think  that’s  accurate.  Our  proposal  is 
for  a  presumptive  20-game  penalty.  Twenty-game  suspension  for  a 
first  positive.  That’s  the  fractional  equivalent  of  10  games  in  the 
National  Basketball  Association  because  they  half  as  many  games 
as  we  do.  Our  proposal  that  a  presumptive  75  games  for  a  second 
penalty  exceeds  I  believe  by  some  percentage,  with  the  possibility 
of 100 games what the NFL’s is for second, and we have if the facts 
warrant  it,  the  possibility  of  a  lifetime  ban  on  a  third,  which  I  be-
lieve is sooner than in some of the other sports. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  You  know,  Mr.  Fehr,  I  think  the  question 
revolves  around,  whether  or  not  this  is  a  serious  thing  that  we’re 
discussing.  And  instead  of  trying  to  arbitrate,  well,  is  this  one 
tough, or is that one tough. Why not give it the maximum penalty 
required?  It  looks  like  baseball  has  gotten  the  message  over  the 
years  and  why  not  just  close  that  door  once  and  for  all.  I  ask——

Mr. FEHR. I’m sorry. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Well, I’d like to ask the other——
Mr. FEHR. Mr. Chair, I have a specific comment I’d like to make 

Senator MCCAIN. OK. 
Mr.  FEHR.  OK.  I’ll  be  brief  and  I  apologize,  but  let  me  draw  a 
deliberately  grossly  exaggerated  analogy  for  purposes  of  making 
the point, and perhaps this will inform you as to what our thinking 
is on this matter. 

Suppose  you  have  two  individuals,  with  a  first  violation.  One  of 
them  is  a  36-year-old  with  a  college  degree,  who  went  and  sought 
out Jose Conseco, and asked who is your supplier and got his stuff 
that  way,  and  the  other  one  is  a  19-year-old  who  was  hurt  and 
ended  up  taking  something  that  somebody  gave  his  mother  that 
she gave him, because they thought it would help him rehabilitate 
faster.  I’m  not  sure  those  two  people  ought  to  be  treated  the  same 
way.  And  they  ought  to  have  an  opportunity  to  tell  their  story.  I 
don’t  know  why  we’re  afraid  to  have  people  tell  their  story  and  let 
somebody decide. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  I  assume  that  there  isn’t  a  single 
person doing the test that’s saying, hey, this guy had this, this guy 
had  that.  If  the  19-year-old  that  you  talk  about  is  top  drawer 
enough  to  play  in  the  Major  Leagues  with  the  accompanying  sal-
ary,  with  the  accompanying  opportunities,  he  ought  to  know  darn 
well the difference between right and wrong. 

Mr. FEHR. I agree. Let me read to you the standard we have. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  No,  but  I  think  what  you  want  to  do  is 
kind  of  negotiate  around  the  edges.  And  in  my  view  that  doesn’t 
sound like it’s a real assessment of how serious this problem is. 

Senator MCCAIN. Senator’s time has expired. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Just  when  I  was  getting  so  interesting. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. FEHR. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Fehr, you say you want to probably get an 
agreement  by  the  World  Series.  One  of  your  excuses  for  not  doing 
it  is  that  players  are  spread  all  over  the  world.  Are  you  going  to 
be able to do that?

61

Mr.  FEHR.  One  of  the  things  that  came  about  as  a  result  of  my 
meeting with the players is I think I know what agreement will be 
passed and be ratified, and I would expect to do that, get the exec-
utive order to ratify it. And then work on some sort of a procedure 
to  get  the  players  to  ratify  it  off-season.  Obviously  that  will  be 
more cumbersome than in season. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  So  in  the  intervening  5  months  we  have  been 
unable  to  reach  an  agreement.  And  by  the  way,  Commissioner 
Selig,  I  don’t  agree  with  your  decision  that  you  made  at  the  last 
round  of  bargaining  to  discard  the  steroid  performance-enhancing 
drugs  issue.  I  think  it  was  a  mistake.  Commissioner  Stern,  why 
have  you  decided  not  to  conduct  random  testing  in  the  off-season? 
Commissioner  STERN.  Senator,  because  as  Commissioner 
Bettman has said, it was also our belief that the muscle mass and 
bulking  up  that  steroids  provide  was  not  a  problem  in  our  sport, 
it  wasn’t  an  issue  in  the  NBA  and  that  explained  why  we  didn’t 
have  an  issue.  We’ve  also—we’ve  been  so  accused  of  having  the 
longest  season.  Which  we  do.  We  concluded  with  our  players  that 
testing  within  the  nine-month  season,  rather  than  chasing  the 
players  all  over  during  the  summertime  was  an  appropriate  re-
sponse to the level of our concern. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Your  policy  allows  for  discretionary  reinstate-

ment after a fourth positive test. What’s the rationale for that? 

Commissioner  STERN.  Well,  you  know,  we  always  been  of  the 

view that the quality of mercy is never strained. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Well,  that’s  an  interesting  statement  but  it’s—

I don’t think——

Commissioner  STERN.  Well,  Shakespeare  I  think  made  it  first, 
and I just associate myself with it. It’s been our experience that the 
suspension—a  lifetime  suspension  with  the  possibility  of  reinstate-
ment  has  usually  been  a  lifetime  suspension.  But  if  there  is  some 
exception,  some  example  for  the  world,  for  the  kids,  for  the  very 
reasons that we’re talking about, we don’t want to rule out the pos-
sibility that it’s appropriate in the precise circumstances. 

Senator MCCAIN. The organization that has great credibility with 
those  who  are  familiar  with  the  all  aspects  of  this  issue  as  you 
sought,  is  the  United  States  Anti-Doping  Agency.  By  the  way,  be-
fore  I  say  that,  the  Congressional  Research  Service  has  reported 
the  anti-doping  policies  for  the  Olympic  movement  are  more  inde-
pendent  of  the  sports  they  regulate,  than  are  the  policies  of  Major 
League Baseball, NBA, and the NFL. They didn’t include the NHL 
because they didn’t have any regimen at that time. USADA argues 
that in order to have a truly independent and therefore truly effec-
tive  performance-enhancing  drug  testing  policy,  four  basic  compo-
nents  are  necessary:  one,  independent  development  and  manage-
ment  of  the  drug  testing  program;  two,  independent  sample  collec-
tors; three, independent analysis of the samples; and four, an inde-
pendent adjudication. All of you have some elements probably. The 
NFL  may  argue  that  they  have  all  those  components.  I’d  like  you 
to  respond  in  writing  as  to  how  you  are  in  compliance  with  those 
four  criteria  for  the  Committee  and  I  would  appreciate  that.  I’ve 
kept you here way too long. Mr. Fehr, when you contact your play-
ers you might include a letter that was written to you and to Com-
missioner  Selig,  by  the  President  of  Little  League  Baseball,  and  I

quote  from  this  letter.  ‘‘We  all  must  accept  the  fact  that  children 
that are affected by the actions of Major Leaguers. In the vast ma-
jority of cases professional athletes provide fine role models, but as 
we  have  seen,  a  few  highly  publicized  cases  can  cause  the  public 
to perceive a stain on the national pastime.’’ I hope you will include 
that  letter,  along  with  the  testimony  of  these  five  initial  witnesses 
we  had  before  this  Committee  and  perhaps  it  can  motivate  you  to 
act  in  a  more  expeditious  fashion  than  you  have  in  the  last  five 
months. 

Senator Bunning. 
Senator  BUNNING.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  know  Con-
gress has had within its power to do something that nobody really 
wants  to  do,  and  that  is  to  bring  up  the  fact  that  Major  League 
Baseball has had an exemption, for over I guess 80 years now, from 
the  Sherman  Antitrust  Act.  The  only  part  of  it  that  is  not  exempt 
is labor negotiations. The use of collective bargaining in labor nego-
tiations is under the Sherman Antitrust Act, by mutual agreement. 
You both agreed that. You look puzzled. 

Mr.  FEHR.  I  look  puzzled  Senator,  because  I  guess,  three  things. 
The  Major  League  Baseball  has  long  had  the  exemption,  the  Con-
gress  changed  that  with  respect  to  players  and  said  that  our  play-
ers  have  the  same  rights  that  players  in  the  other  professional 
sports do in the late 1990s, in the Curt Flood Act, but then the Su-
preme  Court  in  the  middle  1990s,  I  believe  it  was  the  Brown  case 
essentially  said,  that  if  you’re  operating  as  a  union,  the  antitrust 
laws have no role. That’s my understanding of the current state of 
the law. 

Senator BUNNING. But you did have a mutually-bargained agree-
ment between owners and players to exempt all labor negotiations? 
Mr.  FEHR.  We  don’t  get  to  determine  what  the  law  is,  as  you’ve 
been  reminding  us  all  morning.  That’s  the  general  law  applicable 
as I understand it to all labor negotiations. 

Senator  BUNNING.  But  you  did  collectively  bargain  that?  Wrong 

Mr. FEHR. We bargain collectively——
Senator BUNNING. Because I was with Bob——
Mr. FEHR.—under the National Labor Relations Act, yes. 
Senator BUNNING. Donald, do you really believe that after a third 
positive  test,  there’s  a  chance  that  a  player  is  not  using  some 
banned substances? 

Mr.  FEHR.  I  think  two  things.  I  think  it’s  very  unlikely,  and  I 
think the stipulation we have that even that would apply to a first 
case  on  what  the  strict  liability  is  demonstrates  our  view  on  that. 
Which  I’ll  be  glad  to  share  with  you,  or  read  into  the  record.  Sec-
ond,  however,  in  response  to  your  direct  question,  I  believe  that 
when  anyone  is  accused  of  wrongdoing  he  has  to  have  an  oppor-
tunity  as  every  American  does  anywhere  to  tell  his  side  of  the 
story, and to say if he believes——

Senator  BUNNING.  You’ve  made  that  perfectly  clear  to  everybody 

or right? 

on the panel. 

Mr. FEHR. That’s my view. 
Senator  BUNNING.  Mr.  Selig,  or  Mr.  Commissioner,  do  you  think 
it’s possible to work something out before the end of the World Se-
ries?

Commissioner  SELIG.  I  think  it’s  imperative,  Senator  Bunning,  I 
hope we can, this has been a long journey, and I’m hopeful that we 
can  because  frankly,  the  consequences  of  not  doing  it  are  really 
troubling.  And  you’ve  articulated  it  and  so  has  Senator  McCain, 
but  I’ve  worried  about  that,  so  the  answer  is  that  I  don’t  see  that 
we have a choice. But I would say this to you again——

Senator  BUNNING.  Well,  we’re  watching  with  bated  breath  al-

Commissioner  SELIG.  And  nobody  understands  that  better  than 

most. 

I do. 

Senator  BUNNING.  You  talked  about  international  positions  of 
your  players.  What  do  you  think  we  have  at  the  Major  League 
Baseball level? We have Japanese, we have Puerto Rican, we have 
Dominicans,  we  have  Venezuelans,  we  have  Nicaraguans,  we  have 
all kinds of different nationalities represented at the Major League 
Baseball  level.  So  your  exceptions  fit  Major  League  Baseball  also. 
And  we  don’t  think  that  has  a  darn  thing  to  do  with  exceptions  to 
the laws of this country. 

Mr.  BETTMAN.  Actually  I  don’t  think  we’re  seeking  to  be  exempt 
from  the  laws  of  this  country.  I  think  it’s  more  a  question  of  the 
practicalities of administering the testing in the off-season. 

Senator  BUNNING.  They  have  the  same  problem  and  they  have 
made a commitment to make sure that they can test in the off-sea-
son in those various countries. 

Mr.  BETTMAN.  Although  85  percent  of  our  players  are  from  out-

side of the United States. 

Senator  BUNNING.  I  don’t  know  what  the  numbers  are  anymore 
at  the  Major  League  Baseball  level,  but  there  are  more  and  more 
international players. 

Commissioner SELIG. A very significant number, yes. 
Mr. BETTMAN. Senator, the only point that I was seeking to make 
that  as  the  possibility  of  legislation  moves  forward,  individual  cir-
cumstances of the respective leagues. 

Senator  BUNNING.  We  would  love  to  make  the  one  size  not  fits 

all. If the penalties involved fit the problem. 

Mr. BETTMAN. We support that view. Our program has stiff pen-
alties.  We’re  not  looking  to  exempt  our  players  from  the  penalties 
because  of  national  origin,  although  we  do  have  a  practical  issue 
in  terms  of  the  proposed  legislation  limiting,  for  example,  the 
therapeutic  use  exemption  to  licensed  U.S.  physicians  since  our 
players  play  as  home  teams  and  visiting  teams  in  Canada.  We 
think  Canadian  doctors,  licensed  Canadian  physicians,  should  be 
able  to  submit  the  therapeutic  use  exemption.  We  think  that  a 
WADA-sanctioned  lab  in  Canada  should  be  appropriate  as  a 
WADA-sanctioned  U.S.  lab  is  appropriate  for  testing.  Again  we’re 
not  looking  to  exempt  ourselves  from  the  legislation,  we  want  to 
hopefully  be  in  a  position  where  it  makes  sense  because  our  busi-
ness needs are a little bit different than the other sports. 

Senator BUNNING. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator MCCAIN. Senator Allen. 
Senator ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Bunning 
for your leadership on this issue, it’s one that I share your concern 
with.  I  thank  all  our  witnesses  for  being  here,  the  bottom  line  is 
that  there  are  different  ways  that  that  each  of  these  leagues  oper-

ate,  and  I  don’t  know  how  many  of  the  Major  League  Baseball 
players,  while  they  may  come  from  the  Dominican  Republic,  or 
Panama  or  Venezuela,  or  other  countries,  how  many  become  U.S. 
citizens versus those that are Canadians, or Czechs or Swedes. Re-
gardless,  here’s  the  message  that  all  of  you—I  think  most  of  the 
leagues  have  understood  this,  and  I  think  the  Commissioner’s  un-
derstood  it  in  Major  League  Baseball  and  that  is,  that  you  ought 
to  care  as  union  leaders  for  the  health  of  your  players.  For  the 
image,  the  integrity,  the  honesty,  of  a  level  playing  field  over  your 
sport,  you  should  care  about  that.  And  I  know  the  leagues  are  all 
trying  to  get  young  people  interested  in  every  one  of  your  sports. 
And it is important for a lot of these young folks and to the extent 
that  you  are  international,  recognize  that  it  is  also  affecting  a  lot 
of young people. And they look at sport as a ticket out of the situa-
tion  they’re  in.  It’s  an  opportunity  to  live  a  better  life.  Not  only  to 
get a home for themselves, but actually maybe buy a home for their 
mother, and so it is very important when you understand the com-
petitiveness  of  sports,  the  motivation  of  athletes,  that  if  you  told 
athletes  that  if  you  didn’t  sleep,  you’ll  be  better,  they  would  try  to 
stay  awake  all  night  long.  Some  of  them  do  for  the  fun  of  it,  but 
regardless  the  point  of  the  matter  is  you  do  have  a  responsibility, 
and  I  think  three  of  the  four  leagues  here  are  addressing  it,  and 
I  hope  that,  Mr.  Fehr,  you  understand,  that  as  far  as  this  Com-
mittee  and  the  patience,  and  I’m  not  one  who  likes  the  Federal 
Government  meddling  in  things  that  are  best  decided  by  the  pri-
vate  sector  and  collective  bargaining  should  be  respected.  There’s 
going  to  be  a  third  strike  for  you  all,  if  you  don’t  listen  to  what 
Hank  Aaron  and  Robin  Roberts,  and  Lou  Brock  said.  Those  are 
powerful  words  from  the  greats  of  the  sport.  And  as  far  as  Hank 
Aaron is concerned, if a certain player breaks his home run record, 
it’s not a question of an asterisk, there’s going to be a lot of debate. 
There  probably  ought  to  an  Rx  next  to  it,  if  Hank  Aaron’s  record 
is  broken  by  a  certain  individual.  But  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman, 
for  this  hearing,  I  hope  the  pressure  will  be  on,  we’ll  be  watching 
the  World  Series  not  just  for  the—on  the  diamond,  but  hopefully 
getting  a  reasonable  drug  testing  program  for  Major  League  Base-
ball. Thank you. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  I  know  that  all  the  witnesses  who  came  here 
today  had  very  busy  schedules.  We’re  very  appreciative  that  you 
would  take  the  time  to  be  with  us,  and  I  sincerely  hope  that  this 
is  the  last  hearing  that  we  will  ever  have  on  this  particular  issue. 
And again, I am very appreciative of a lot of the progress that has 
already  been  made.  And  I  look  forward,  being  an  eternal  optimist, 
that  we  will  soon  see  a  resolution  of  this  issue  without  necessity 
or  requirement  of  legislation.  I  thank  the  witnesses  for  being  here 
today. And this hearing is adjourned. 

[Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X

PREPARED STATEMENT OF FRANK D. URYASZ, PRESIDENT, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR 

DRUG FREE SPORT, INC. 

My  name  is  Frank  D.  Uryasz,  President  of  The  National  Center  for  Drug  Free 

Sport, Inc. 

Drug Free Sport, a private company based in Kansas City, Missouri, administers 
sports  drug-testing  programs  throughout  the  United  States.  Our  staff  also  provides 
drug  and  dietary  supplement  education  programs  for  high  schools  and  colleges  and 
sponsors a ‘‘drug information hotline’’ through our Resource Exchange Center (REC) 
( www.drugfreesport.com/rec). 

I have been involved in managing national drug-testing programs for athletes for 
nearly 20 years. In July 1986, I was hired by The National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation  (NCAA)  to  establish  its  first  drug-testing  program.  While  at  the  NCAA,  I 
was also responsible for administration of all collegiate health and safety programs 
under  the  guidance  of  the  NCAA’s  medical  committee.  Under  my  guidance,  the 
NCAA drug-testing program grew from a post-season program involving about 1,200 
tests  per  year  to  a  year-round,  short-notice  testing  program  that  included  about 
10,000 tests annually. 

In the late 1990s, I was also serving on the U.S. Olympic Committee Anti-Doping 
Committee,  which  was  looking  for  a  new  model  for  Olympic  drug-testing  program 
administration.  This  preceded  the  formation  of  the  World  Anti-Doping  Agency 
(WADA)  and  the  U.S.  Anti-Doping  Agency  (USADA).  The  impetus  for  a  new  model 
was  the  desire  for  sports  organizations  to  avoid  the  actual  and  perceived  conflicts 
of  interests  that  existed  by  operating  their  own  testing  programs.  Critics  believed 
such  testing  programs  when  operated  in  house  were  lacking  the  necessary  impar-
tiality  that  would  prevent  preferential  treatment  of  high-profile  athletes.  Some  em-
barrassing cases involving sports stars supported this belief. It was at this time that 
sports  drug  testing  began  to  embrace  concepts  such  as  harmonization,  external-
ization and transparency and independent entities such as USADA and WADA were 
formed. 

In  1999,  I  left  the  NCAA  to  start  The  National  Center  for  Drug  Free  Sport.  The 
NCAA  externalized  its  drug-testing  program  to  Drug  Free  Sport  that  year.  At  that 
time, many colleges and universities also began to see the value of outside adminis-
tration  for  their  drug-testing  programs.  Today,  Drug  Free  Sport  runs  the  NCAA’s 
testing programs, testing programs for over 150 colleges and universities. testing for 
AAU Powerlifting and as of March 2005, the testing for the Minor Leagues through 
Major League Baseball. 

When Drug Free Sport administers an organization’s testing program, the organi-
zation  agrees  to  allow  Drug  Free  Sport  to  select  when  and  where  athletes  will  be 
tested and agrees to follow our strict protocol on collection and management of posi-
tive results. 

The National Football League and Major League Baseball (for the Minor Leagues) 

utilize Drug Free Sport’s ‘‘drug hotline’’ for its athletes and medical personnel. 

Drug Free Sport supports the Committee’s desire to deter the use of banned ana-
bolic  steroids  at  all  levels  of  sport.  The  public  debate  of  the  anabolic  steroid  use 
problem  in  the  United  States  has  prompted  many  communities  to  begin  a  dialogue 
on  how  best  to  keep  young  people  from  using  these  drugs.  I  have  been  involved  in 
community  forums  in  Texas,  Illinois  and  other  states,  which  would  never  have  oc-
curred  if  Congress  hadn’t  brought  the  problem  to  a  greater  level  of  awareness.  The 
National  Federation  of  State  High  School  Associations  developed  an  excellent  ster-
oid-education  campaign.  This,  too,  grew  out  of  Congress’  actions  to  bring  attention 
to  the  fact  that  high  school  students  use  steroids  to  enhance  their  appearance  and 
to improve athletic performance. 

There  is  no  question  in  my  mind  that  the  Federal  Government  has  an  important 
role  to  play  in  helping  sport  deter  the  use  of  anabolic  steroids  and  other  perform-
ance-enhancing  drugs  such  as  growth  hormone.  My  twenty  years  of  experience  in 
athletics drug-use deterrence has convinced me that the government’s resources are

best utilized in two areas: reducing access to and the supply of anabolic steroids and 
other performance-enhancing drugs in the U.S. and funding research into the detec-
tion of growth hormone and other dangerous banned drugs. 

Despite  the  best  intentions  of  members  of  this  Committee,  the  provisions  of  S. 
1114,  the  Clean  Sports  Act  of  2005,  and  S.  1334,  the  Professional  Sports  Integrity 
and  Accountability  Act,  are  flawed.  Although  the  intent  of  this  proposed  legisla-
tion—drug  free  professional  sports—is  laudable  and  no  doubt  supported  by  anyone 
who cares about sport and the athletes who participate, the legislation itself will not 
lead to the desired outcome. 

Sport  drug-testing  programs  are  complicated  to  operate.  The  drugs  change,  the 
patterns of use change, athletes can be hard to find, some athletes try to cheat, high 
profile athletes surround themselves with people who enable their drug use and an 
entire  industry  exists  to  develop  performance-enhancing  drugs  that  cannot  be  de-
tected.  All  of  this  can  be  managed,  but  this  management  requires  approaches  that 
are  appropriate  to  the  population  of  athletes  being  served.  What  works  for  the  col-
leges  probably  doesn’t  work  for  the  Olympic  athletes  and  what  works  for  Olympic 
athletes in all likelihood will not work for the pros. 

It  is  not  possible  for  me  within  the  constraints  of  this  written  statement  to  thor-
oughly outline what needs to happen in the U.S. to rid all levels of sport of the use 
of  performance-enhancing  drugs  including  steroids.  However,  I  hope  the  members 
of  this  Committee  consider  the  following  as  they  proceed  with  Federal  legislation 
to deter athletes’ use of drugs:

1. We lack evidence that the drug-testing models implemented in Olympic sport 
over  the  past  five  years  have  reduced  the  use  of  drugs  in  that  population.  It 
is simply too soon to tell and to my knowledge there is no known plan to meas-
ure this.
2.  The  creation  of  WADA  and  USADA  have  ameliorated  many  of  the  problems 
associated  with  adjudication  of  Olympic  doping  cases  but  their  processes  and 
protocols  are  extremely  expensive  to  operate  and  to  use  them  as  a  model  for 
other  levels  of  sport  will  lead  to  fewer  resources  being  used  for  testing  and  re-
search.
3.  The  goal  of  a  sports  drug-testing  program  is  to  deter  drug  use.  The  achieve-
ment of this goal cannot be measured by the number of people ‘‘caught.’’ Sports 
entities  should  be  required  to  develop  tools  to  measure  whether  their  testing 
programs are reducing drug use and should be required to publish this informa-
tion.
4.  It  is  too  soon  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  MLB’s  revised  drug-deterrence 
programs and to force an Olympic testing model on that population at this point 
is without merit.
5.  Although  we  do  not  know  with  certainty  the  extent  of  growth  hormone  use 
at the collegiate and professional sport level, we know that it is being used. The 
Federal Government must get research dollars directly to the scientists who can 
best solve this problem quickly.
6.  My  extensive  experience  with  college  football  players  has  convinced  me  that 
the  NCAA’s  and  NFL’s  steroid  testing  programs  have  significantly  reduced  the 
use  of  anabolic  steroid  use  in  the  college  football  population.  The  NCAA’s  pub-
lished national drug use studies support my position.
7.  Even  after  working  in  the  sports  drug-testing  field  for  nearly  twenty  years, 
I  remain  uncomfortable  with  the  title  ‘‘sports  drug-testing  expert’’  when  associ-
ated  with  my  name.  However,  there  are  many  people  who  enjoy  having  this 
term  associated  with  their  work,  even  though  they  have  never  run  a  sports 
drug-testing  program,  have  never  collected  a  urine  specimen  from  an  athlete, 
have never done the analytical work on a urine or blood specimen from an ath-
lete,  have  never  spent  a  week  in  a  courtroom  trying  to  explain  to  a  judge  the 
complexities  of  steroid  chemistry  nor  have  they  done  any  original  research  in 
the anti-doping field. These so called ‘‘experts’’ criticism of existing drug-testing 
programs  in  sport  undermine  the  public’s  trust  in  what  we  do  and  the  Federal 
Government should be careful when considering the accuracy of what they say.
8. The Federal Government must help sport by reducing the supply of anabolic 
steroids and growth hormone. The flow of anabolic steroids and growth hormone 
across  the  borders  and  their  availability  for  purchase  over  the  Internet  are 
problems sport cannot solve.

Thank you for the opportunity to get my thoughts before the Committee.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO ALLAN H. SELIG 

Question  1.  Commissioner  Selig,  it  occurs  to  me  that  you  may  be  a  late  convert 
to  the  anti-steroids  fold.  In  the  last  10–15  years,  when  players  who  had  never  hit 
more than a few home runs a year suddenly were hitting 30, 40, or more home runs, 
didn’t Major League Baseball look the other way at what could very well have been 
evidence of the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs? 

Answer.  The  change  in  home  run  totals  became  obvious  in  the  1990s.  Baseball 
followers, including members of the media, offered a number of explanations for the 
change,  including  expansion,  weak  pitching  and  smaller  ballparks.  There  was  little 
or  no  mention  in  the  press  or  otherwise  of  performance-enhancing  substances  as  a 
possible cause. Late in the 1990s, Baseball—as a result of the McGwire revelations 
of Andro use and other developments—became concerned that drugs might be a fac-
tor. At that time, Baseball, under my leadership, began an aggressive effort to deal 
with steroids. My staff gathered information on steroids and how they worked. Edu-
cational programs were developed at the Major and Minor League level. We also de-
veloped  and  implemented  the  industry’s  first  Minor  League  testing  program. 
Progress at the Major League level was slower due to our collective bargaining obli-
gations,  but  Baseball  was  certainly  not  ‘‘looking  the  other  way.’’  In  fact,  in  2002, 
Baseball  was  able  to  negotiate  our  first  ever  drug  testing  program  for  the  Major 
Leagues by making that topic a key priority in collective bargaining.

Question 2. What do you have to say about MLB’s marketing during that period? 
Did  you  market  the  home  run?  Didn’t  you  use  the  McGwire-Sosa  home  run  race  to 
‘‘save’’  Baseball?  Did  it  ever  occur  to  you  to  make  sure  that  all  these  home  runs—
and  I  don’t  mean  to  single  out  just  these  two  players—but  did  it  ever  occur  to  you 
to make sure that the numbers people were putting up were not tainted? 

Answer.  As  an  initial  matter,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  Baseball  had  no 
centralized marketing effort based on the popularity of the home run. The home run 
race occurred, it captured the imagination of our fans, and therefore, generated tre-
mendous  interest.  The  great  growth  of  the  game  in  recent  years  is  due  to  an  array 
of reasons more fundamental than the appeal of home runs. 

In  terms  of  investigating  whether  home  run  numbers  were  tainted,  one  must 
begin  with  the  proposition  that  the  only  way  to  determine  accurately  steroid  use  is 
through  testing.  In  1998,  Baseball  was  in  the  middle  of  a  collective  bargaining 
agreement that did not allow random testing for steroids.

Question 3. Even if it was the official policy of MLB to ban steroids and other per-
formance-enhancing  drugs—if  you  weren’t  technically  condoning  their  use—why 
isn’t  it  fair  for  observers  to  accuse  you  of  being  willfully  blind  to  what  was  going 
on? 

Answer.  Major  League  Baseball  cannot  fairly  be  accused  of  being  willfully  blind 
to  steroid  use.  In  the  1990s  people  were  not  talking  or  writing  about  steroid  use 
in  Baseball.  Over  the  period  in  question,  Baseball  gradually  became  aware  of  the 
problem  with  steroids.  As  that  awareness  grew,  Baseball  took  steps  to  combat  the 
problem.  Educational  materials  were  prepared  outlining  the  dangers  of  steroid  use. 
Major  and  Minor  League  players  were  required  to  attend  training  sessions  on 
steroids. Major League Baseball developed and implemented the first ever drug pol-
icy covering Minor League players. 

Federal  labor  laws,  of  course,  prevented  Baseball  from  unilaterally  implementing 
a similar policy at the Major League level. Consistent with its collective bargaining 
obligations, Baseball proposed a new policy in the next round of bargaining that oc-
curred  in  2001–2002.  That  policy  was  ultimately  agreed  upon  in  2002  and,  for  the 
first time, Baseball had testing. The policy has been improved twice since that time. 
Baseball  believes  that  this  course  of  conduct  is  inconsistent  with  an  assertion  of 

willful blindness. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO

ALLAN H. SELIG 

Question  1.  Isn’t  there  an  advantage  to  having  uniformity  in  testing  for  all  the 

major league sports teams? 

Answer.  It  is  very  difficult  to  develop  a  uniform  program  that  is  applicable  to  all 
sports  because  each  sport  has  unique  issues.  For  example,  on  penalties,  a  fixed  pe-
riod has different ramifications in different sports. In track and field, a two-year ban 
would  probably  cause  the  athlete  to  miss  less  than  10  important  competitions.  In 
Baseball,  a  two-year  ban  would  cover  at  least  324  games,  not  including  the  post-
season.  A  better  approach  would  be  collectively  bargained  policies  designed  to  ad-

dress the unique circumstances of each sport, assuming the policies are each strong 
enough to deter use.

Question  2.  The  current  testing  method  doesn’t  detect  all  performance-enhancing 
substances.  Why  don’t  you  use  blood  tests  which  are  better  at  detecting  substances 
like human growth hormone? 

Answer. The short answer is that the Major League Baseball Players Association 
has been unwilling to agree to blood tests. Blood testing is obviously more intrusive 
than urine testing and, in fact, urine testing is very accurate for all substances, ex-
cept human growth hormone. Major League Baseball has funded a three-year grant 
for  Dr.  Donald  Catlin,  of  the  UCLA  Laboratory,  directed  at  developing  a  urine  test 
for  human  growth  hormone.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  there  is  no  definitive 
proof as to scientific validity of the available blood test for human growth hormone. 
No governing body of a sport has disciplined an athlete based on that test. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO DONALD M. FEHR 

Question 1. In your testimony before this Committee in 2004, you stated that the 
Players Association ‘‘neither condones nor supports the use by players, or by anyone 
else,  of  any  unlawful  substance...’’  In  your  testimony  this  year,  you  seem  to  imply 
the  only  reason  that  the  MLB  Players  Association  agreed  to  negotiate  a  stronger 
steroids testing regime was because of Congressional pressure. I do not get the feel-
ing  that  you  believe  that  steroid  or  unlawful  substance  abuse  constitutes  a  real 
problem. Mr. Fehr, your previous testimony before this Committee and your written 
statement today hardly gives a strong impression that the Players Union is particu-
larly concerned about illegal substance use and its impact on the game. What is the 
Players  Association  doing  internally  to  prevent  its  members  from  cheating?  I  know 
it is a strong word, but let’s call it what it is. What are the union’s internal policies 
to prevent use of illegal substances before it occurs? 

Answer.  It  is  simply  counterintuitive  to  suggest  that  anyone  or  any  entity  cares 
more  about  the  health  of  the  players  than  those  people  who  have  dedicated  their 
professional  careers  to  their  protection.  We  have  long  been  concerned  with  the  po-
tential  consequences  of  illegal  substances.  Indeed,  it  was  our  concern  with  the  use 
of substances Congress said can be legally purchased that led to our groundbreaking 
study of andostendione, a copy of which was provided to the Committee in conjunc-
tion  with  prior  testimony.  Every  year,  the  Players  Association  meets  with  its  con-
stituents during spring training to talk about, among other things, information con-
cerning  the  use,  abuse  and  potential  consequences  of  steroids,  nutritional  supple-
ments,  and  other  substances  believed  to  augment  or  enhance  training  routines  or 
performance.  In  addition,  every  year  each  player  is  given  written  materials,  pre-
pared  in  cooperation  with  Major  League  Baseball,  concerning  these  substances.  To 
ensure  our  information  is  as  current  as  possible,  we  also  employ  the  services  of  a 
highly  qualified,  licensed  medical  practitioner  to  review  existing  medical  literature 
that  may  be  pertinent  to  our  members.  Moreover,  at  meetings  with  players,  during 
spring  training  and  throughout  the  year,  we  also  discuss  with  players  the  impor-
tance of exercising care before taking any substance reported or claimed to improve 
training  capacity,  to  increase  strength  and  endurance,  or  to  improve  performance. 
Finally,  players  are  reminded  that  they  can  contact  the  Association  at  any  time  if 
they  have  questions  about  a  product,  our  program,  or  where  they  can  receive  addi-
tional information if needed.

Question 2. In your testimony, you do not even mention the impact that your play-
ers’ conduct has on younger athletes. In fact, your testimony does not even condemn 
the use of these illegal substances as all of the other player’s testimony does. Given 
the  fact  that  so  many  young  baseball  players  are  taking  steroids,  do  you  not  feel 
an obligation to lead on this issue rather than be obstructionist? 

Answer. That is not the record. I have repeatedly made it clear that we are com-
mitted  to  dispelling  any  notion  that  the  route  to  becoming  a  Major  League  athlete 
somehow  includes  taking  illegal  performance-enhancing  substances  like  steroids.  I 
have  stated  in  both  written  and  oral  testimony  before  Congress  that  playing  Major 
League  Baseball  requires  talent,  drive,  intelligence,  determination,  and  grit,  and 
that  steroids  have  no  place  in  the  equation.  As  I  have  noted  in  past  testimony  to 
this  same  Committee,  neither  the  Players  Association  nor  its  constituents  condone 
nor  support  the  use  of  any  unlawful  substance,  nor  do  they  support  or  condone  the 
unlawful  use  of  any  legal  substance.  We  recognize  our  role  in  this  issue  and  have 
repeatedly  taken,  and  continue  to  take,  steps  to  eliminate  the  presence  of  illegal 
substances  in  our  sport  and  to  dispel  the  myth  that  steroids  and  other  illegal  per-
formance-enhancing  substances  are  the  key  to  athletic  success.  We  also  believe  we

have  a  responsibility  to  our  members  and  those  who  hope  to  play  baseball  in  the 
future to ensure that our testing program is as accurate as is scientifically possible, 
that its administration is fair and just, and that the penalties are designed to deter 
use  and  prevent  repeat  offenses,  as  opposed  to  simply  punishing  for  punishment’s 
sake.

Question  3.  Isn’t  your  strong  opposition  a  potent  signal  to  young  baseball  players 
that  these  products  are  not  really  harmful  and  imply  that  they  may  even  be  nec-
essary? 

Answer.  Our  testing  program  and  our  members’  support  for  it  are,  in  fact,  evi-
dence  that  we  strongly  oppose  the  use  of  illegal  performance-enhancing  substances 
by  anyone,  especially  young  people.  We  do  believe,  however,  that  eliminating  the 
presence  of  performance-enhancing  substances  in  professional  sports  is  only  part  of 
what needs to be done to combat the growing use and abuse of both legal and illegal 
substances  by  our  Nation’s  youth.  I  hope  the  Committee  will  not  limit  its  attention 
to  a  top-down  review  of  just  testing  programs,  but  will  also  focus  on  other  compo-
nents  of  the  problem.  For  example,  attention  needs  to  be  given  to  the  unfortunate 
reality  that  for  many  young  people,  steroids  are  still  only  a  mouse  click  away  on 
the Internet. We are now seeing that use of these products is not limited to individ-
uals  seeking  athletic  success.  And,  as  I  have  testified  before,  it  is  unfortunate  that 
our  culture  does  not  have  a  uniformly  negative  image  of  steroids,  as  evidenced  in 
the marketing campaigns of corporate giants like 3-M and Saab, or by the promotion 
of the new video game, Blitz: The League. I hope Congress will focus on these issues 
as well.

Question.  What  is  it  about  baseball  players  that  justifies  more  lenient  penalties 

for taking steroids than athletes of other sports? 

Answer. Nothing. The penalties in baseball are not more lenient. They are simply 
tailored,  as  they  are  in  other  leagues,  to  the  particular  circumstances  in  the  sport. 
The  Players  Association  believes  the  goal  of  our  program  is—and  should  be—to 
deter use of illegal substances and to prevent repeat offense. Today, in baseball, our 
players are tested throughout the year on an unannounced, random basis, which is 
not  the  case  in  other  sports.  They  are  tested  for  all  the  substances  that  the  United 
States  has  determined  to  be  illegal  steroids  and  steroid  precursors.  The  tests  are 
administered  by  independent,  qualified  experts.  The  evidence  so  far  indicates  that 
our  current  penalties  are  sufficient  to  deter  initial  use  and  repeat  offenses  without 
destroying  careers.  Nonetheless,  as  evidenced  by  our  current  negotiations,  we  are 
continuing  to  work  to  strengthen  our  program.  The  penalty  structure  for  steroids 
we have proposed to the owners, and shared with the Committee, is more restrictive 
than  the  NFL’s  program  with  regard  to  repeat  offenders,  and  it  is  either  equal  to 
or more stringent than the existing programs for steroids in the NBA and the NHL.

PAUL TAGLIABUE 

Question  1.  Isn’t  there  an  advantage  to  having  uniformity  in  testing  for  all  the 

major league sports teams? 

Answer. As between the member teams of an individual sports league, we strongly 
agree  that  there  is  an  advantage  to  uniformity  and  that  is  a  key  element  of  the 
NFL’s program. No individual team selects players for testing, conducts or schedules 
tests, reviews test data, represents the player on appeal, or makes disciplinary deci-
sions.  This  centralization  of  administration  is  critical  in  ensuring  that  the  testing 
program operates fairly and consistently for all teams and all players. 

As among sports leagues, there is substantial consistency in testing but there are 
important  differences  among  the  sports  that  warrant  tailored  administration.  For 
example, some leagues have adopted a distinction between so-called ‘‘in season’’ and 
‘‘out-of-competition’’  testing.  Under  that  model,  certain  substances  are  prohibited 
only  when  used  during  a  particular  competition,  and  athletes  are  free  to  use  those 
substances,  without  fear  of  penalty,  during  the  ‘‘off-season’’  in  that  sport.  The  NFL 
has  never  embraced  that  distinction,  believing  instead  that  a  single  set  of  rules 
should  apply  to  all  players  throughout  the  year.  Accordingly,  our  testing  program 
insists upon uniform testing for all substances on our prohibited list throughout the 
year, both in season and out-of-season. Indeed, at a time when the Olympic testing 
program has reduced its out-of-competition testing program by as much as fifty per-
cent,  the  NFL  and  NFL  Players  Association  have  agreed  to  increase—by  a  factor

70

of  three—the  number  of  off-season  tests  to  which  NFL  players  are  subject.  We  be-
lieve  that  within  certain  parameters,  leagues  should  be  able  to  determine  the  test-
ing program that best fits the needs of that particular sport.

Question  2.  The  current  testing  method  doesn’t  detect  all  performance-enhancing 
substances. Why don’t you use blood tests which are better at detecting substances 
like human growth hormone? 

Answer.  Until  the  2004  summer  Olympic  Games  in  Athens,  human  growth  hor-
mone was not tested for in any sport—amateur, professional or Olympic. At the Ath-
ens Olympics, 300 athletes—out of more than 11,000—gave blood samples that were 
tested  for  human  growth  hormone.  No  positives  were  reported.  We  have  reviewed 
closely  the  results  of  those  tests  and  other  efforts  to  identify  testing  methods  for 
growth hormone and other substances. Our own advisors, many of whom have con-
sulted closely with the Olympic movement and other sports organizations for years, 
do not believe that the blood test used last year is sufficiently validated and reliable 
to  use  on  a  widespread  basis  in  the  NFL.  Moreover,  no  lab  in  the  United  States 
is  yet  certified  to  perform  the  blood  test  used  at  the  Athens  Olympics.  We  do  not 
believe it would be sound policy to extract blood samples from NFL players and ship 
them  across  the  ocean  for  testing  in  a  lab  in  Australia  or  Europe.  Moreover,  blood 
test results have often been highly controversial and at times inconclusive. One ex-
ample  is  the  recent  suspension  of  American  cyclist  Tyler  Hamilton,  whose  appeal 
was lengthy, contentious and subject to continuing debate. 

Equally  important,  converting  to  blood  testing  would  not  strengthen  the  overall 
effectiveness  of  doping  policies.  With  respect  to  the  vast  majority  of  performance-
enhancing  drugs  including  steroids  and  stimulants,  urine  testing  is  scientifically 
more  accurate,  efficient  and  reliable.  The  arguable  benefits  of  blood  testing  relate 
only  to  growth  hormones  and  blood  doping.  Notwithstanding,  we  will  continue  to 
work  both  independently  and  in  conjunction  with  the  United  States  Anti-Doping 
Agency  and  other  organizations  to  develop  better  methods  of  testing  for  perform-
ance-enhancing  substances,  including.  human  growth  hormone.  As  part  of  that  ef-
fort,  we  have  partnered  with  USADA  to  fund  the  development  of  a  new  laboratory, 
the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory, which is based at the Univer-
sity of Utah.

Question  1.  Isn’t  there  an  advantage  to  having  uniformity  in  testing  for  all  the 

Major League sports teams? 

Answer.  The  NBA  does  not  believe  that  a  ‘‘one-size-fits-all’’  approach  is  sensible 
for  a  drug  testing  policy.  NBA  players  are  different  from  athletes  in  other  sports. 
Their  bodies  are  different  (tall  and  lean);  their  skill  sets  are  different  (quickness, 
leaping  ability);  their  training  regimens  and  schedules  are  different.  Substances 
that  may  be  of  substantial  advantage  to  athletes  in  other  sports—such  as  football 
or baseball players—may provide no advantage to basketball players. 

A  drug  testing  regime  that  was  designed  for,  among  others,  cyclists  and 
weightlifters  (such  as  the  WADA  Code)  is  certainly  not  appropriate  for  basketball 
players. 

There  are  also  other  relevant  differences  between  the  sports.  For  example,  some 
leagues (such as the NBA) have longer seasons than others, making off-season test-
ing less important. Some leagues play games every day; some only play once a week. 
Each individual league needs the flexibility to design a drug policy and testing pro-
gram that is correctly tailored to its unique circumstances. 

The NBA believes that collective bargaining is the best method for accomplishing 
this.  The  parties  to  the  collective  bargaining  relationship—here,  the  NBA  and  the 
National  Basketball  Players  Association—are  most  knowledgeable  about  their  par-
ticular  issues  and  needs.  Moreover,  a  policy  that  is  the  product  of  agreement  is  al-
most  always  superior  to  one  imposed  from  the  outside,  as  the  parties  will  be  in-
vested  in  its  success.  This  is  certainly  true  in  the  NBA,  where  the  collective  bar-
gaining process has led to a strong and effective policy against steroids and perform-
ance-enhancing drugs in our sport.

Question  2.  The  current  testing  method  doesn’t  detect  all  performance-enhancing 
substances.  Why  don’t  you  use  blood  tests  which  are  better  at  detecting  substances 
like human growth hormone? 

Answer.  Blood  testing  is  more  invasive  than  urine  testing,  and  it  raises  health 
and  safety  issues  that  are  not  present  with  urine  testing.  Further,  blood  testing  is 
only  useful  for  a  select  number  of  specialized  substances,  such  as  EPO.  (It  is  our 
understanding  that  there  is  no  universally  accepted  blood  test,  for  example,  for

human growth hormone.) Urine testing picks up all of the substances on the NBA’s 
broad  list  of  prohibited  drugs.  Since  there  is  scant  evidence  of  even  minimal  use  of 
steroids  and  illicit  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  the  NBA,  much  less  any  evi-
dence of the use of EPO, there no substantial justification for changing our accepted 
method of drug testing.

RE: NHL DRUG TESTING PROGRAM

Dear Senator McCain:
Commissioner  Bettman  requested  that  I  respond  to  your  request  for  an  expla-
nation as to whether the National Hockey League/National Hockey League Players’ 
Association’s  performance-enhancing  Substances  Program  (the  ‘‘Program’’)  features 
the following four basic components: 
1.  Independent  Development  and  Management  of  the  Drug  Testing  Pro-

gram: 

The  Program  will  be  managed  by  an  independent  entity  that  will  be  responsible 
for  hiring  independent  collectors  and  determining  when  random  no-notice  testing 
will  occur.  The  independent  entity  will  also  coordinate  with  a  WADA-certified  test-
ing laboratory to create reports of the test results. 

The  Program  was  developed  jointly  by  the  NHL  and  the  NHLPA,  and  is  jointly 
administered by a Program Committee comprised of an equal number of League and 
NHLPA representatives and two (2) consulting expert doctors, one (1) nominated by 
each  party.  (The  Program  Committee  determined  that  an  independent  entity  shall 
manage  the  Program,  as  described  above.)  The  NHL  and  the  NHLPA  strongly  be-
lieve that our collective knowledge regarding our sport, including but not limited to 
our  intimate  familiarity  with  our  schedule  (in-season  and  off-season,  game  day  and 
non-game day), the international make-up of our player population, and the history 
(or  lack  thereof)  of  performance-enhancing  drug  use  had  enabled  us  to  develop  an 
effective  and  meaningful  Program.  We  also  believe  that  our  active  management  of 
the  Program  will  enable  us  to  jointly  monitor  its  effectiveness  and  to  modify  it,  as 
necessary,  over  time,  to  ensure  that  it  functions  to  address  and  eliminate  the  use, 
however negligible, of performance-enhancing substances in our sport. 
2. Independent Sample Collectors: 

The Program will provide for independent, third-party sample collectors. 

3. Independent Analysis of the Sample: 

The samples will be independently analyzed by a WADA-approved laboratory. 

4. Independent Adjudication: 

The Program provides for the independent adjudication of appeals of positive test 
results.  Specifically,  the  Program  provides  the  ‘‘NHLPA  may,  on  a  Player’s  behalf, 
appeal a positive test to the Impartial Arbitrator on an expedited basis, utilizing the 
procedures set forth in Article 17 of the Agreement.’’ Article 17 of the Collective Bar-
gaining  Agreement  between  the  National  Hockey  League  and  National  Hockey 
League  Players’  Association  provides  for  the  parties  to  jointly  appoint  an  Impartial 
Arbitrator who serves for a period of at least one (1) year and hears and issues deci-
sions regarding disputes involving the CBA. 

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  express  our  views  regarding  the  issues  and 
questions  set  forth  above.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  you  on  this 
important matter.

RE: NHL DRUG TESTING PROGRAM

Dear Senator Lautenberg: 
Please  accept  this  letter  as  the  National  Hockey  League’s  response  to  the  fol-
lowing  questions  raised  by  you  regarding  testing  for  performance-enhancing  sub-
stances: 

Question 1. Is there an advantage to having uniformity in testing for all the Major 

League sports teams? 

Answer. We believe that it would only be advantageous to impose uniform stand-
ards on all major league professional sports if such standards were to appropriately 
recognize  and  reflect  the  unique  circumstances  and  traits  applicable  to  each  par-
ticular  sport,  without  unduly  lowering  or  raising  the  bar  applicable  to  all  sports. 
The major league professional sports are not ‘‘uniform,’’ and indeed, have numerous 
and significant differences in, inter alia, the length of and number of games in their 
playing  seasons  and  the  corresponding  length  of  their  off-seasons,  the  national  or 
international make-up of their players and teams, the average age and career length 
of  each  league’s  players,  and  significantly,  the  history  of  problems  associated  with 
the  use  of  performance-enhancing  drugs  in  the  sport.  For  example,  with  respect  to 
NHL  players,  the  applicable  standards  would  need  to  recognize  and  reflect  the 
practicalities  and  legalities  that  would  arise  from  mandatory  off-season  testing  of 
NHL players, given that our players come from twenty-two (22) countries across the 
globe,  and  eighty-five  (85)  percent  of  our  players  come  from  outside  the  United 
States, many of whom return to their country of origin during the off-season. Other 
sports  simply  may  not  need  to  address  these  circumstances.  In  addition,  while  it 
may  be  appropriate  to  spend  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  test  players  five 
(5) times during the calendar year in a sport that has a suspected or confirmed his-
tory  of  performance-enhancing  drug  use,  it  may  not  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to 
do so in a sport such as hockey which has no such historical experience. 1 Reducing 
the  attributes  of  the  testing  program  to  the  least  common  denominator  may  result 
in  an  insufficient  program  in  certain  sports,  and  rising  to  the  highest  common  de-
nominator  may  be  unduly  burdensome  on  other  sports,  without  justification.  For 
these  reasons,  we  are  not  convinced  that  it  would  be  advantageous  to  impose  uni-
form standards on all sports. 

Question 2. Why doesn’t the League use blood tests, which are better at detecting 

substances like the human growth hormone? 

Answer.  First,  we  have  not  seen  scientific  evidence  that  the  blood  tests  currently 
administered  do,  in  fact,  materially  enhance  the  ability  to  accurately  and  reliably 
detect  substances  such  as  the  human  growth  hormone.  Second,  we  believe  that  ad-
ministering  3,500  blood  tests  annually  (five  tests  per  player  for  700  NHL  players) 
would be excessively invasive, costly and time-consuming. Notably, WADA will con-
duct  a  total  of  only  88  in-competition  blood  tests  during  the  2006  Olympic  Games, 
which  involve  numerous  different  competitions  and  many  hundreds  of  athletes.  To 
the extent blood tests are used at all outside of the context of international athletic 
competitions, we believe it is similarly appropriate to do so only in very limited cir-
cumstances. 

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  express  our  views  regarding  the  issues  and 
questions  set  forth  above.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  you  on  this 
important matter. 

Sincerely, 

WILLIAM L. DALY, 
Deputy Commissioner.
