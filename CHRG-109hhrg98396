HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Options for Hubble Science

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose and General Background

On  Wednesday,  February  2,  the  Committee  on  Science  will  hold  a  hearing  to  ex-

amine the options for the future of the Hubble Space Telescope.

Launched in 1990, the Hubble is, according to the National Academy of Sciences,
‘‘arguably  the  most  powerful  single  optical  astronomical  facility  ever  built’’  and  ‘‘a
uniquely  powerful  observing  platform’’  that  has  made  ‘‘profound  contributions’’  to
the human understanding of the universe.

The  Hubble  was  designed  at  a  time  (before  the  1986  Challenger  accident)  when
it was assumed that the Space Shuttle would be used regularly to launch and serv-
ice  satellites.  As  a  result,  the  Hubble  was  launched  by  the  Shuttle  (rather  than  by
an expendable rocket) and was designed to require periodic servicing by astronauts
to remain aloft and functioning. Four missions have serviced the Shuttle (including
one that was not originally planned to correct a flaw in the Hubble’s mirror). A fifth
and  final  mission  was  scheduled  for  2004  both  to  replace  the  batteries  and  gyro-
scopes  the  Hubble  needs  to  continue  to  function  and  to  add  new  scientific  equip-
ment. (That scientific equipment has already been built and is at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Maryland.) Without servicing, the Hubble will cease functioning as
early as 2007 when the batteries run low; the exact timing is uncertain.

The  demise  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  in  February  2003  necessitated  a
change  in  the  plans  for  the  Hubble.  At  the  very  least,  the  loss  of  the  Columbia
meant a significant delay in Hubble servicing. (The Shuttle will not return to flight
earlier  than  May  2005  and  has  a  backlog  of  missions  to  construct  and  service  the
International  Space  Station  (ISS).)  But  last  January,  NASA  Administrator  Sean
O’Keefe  ruled  out  any  servicing  mission,  announcing  that  the  Shuttle  would  no
longer  fly  to  destinations  other  than  the  ISS,  citing  safety  concerns.  That  decision
appeared to doom the Hubble.

But the Hubble was given a new lease on life, when, responding to a public outcry
and pressure from Congress, NASA proposed last year to develop a robot to perform
the  necessary  servicing.  NASA  also  contracted  with  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences to review its decision.

In  December,  the  Academy  issued  a  report  that  took  issue  with  every  aspect  of
the  NASA  approach  and  recommended  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission.  The  Academy
concluded  that  the  likelihood  of  NASA’s  robotic  plan  succeeding  was  ‘‘remote.’’  The
Academy  also  found  that  a  Shuttle  sent  to  the  Hubble  faced  risks  similar  to  those
faced by a Shuttle sent to the International Space Station. (NASA plans to send the
Shuttle to the Space Station as many as 30 more times.)

Two  additional  studies  funded  by  NASA,  one  performed  internally  and  the  other
performed by The Aerospace Corporation, similarly concluded that a robotic mission
to service the Hubble would not be ready in time to save the Hubble before its bat-
teries died. (The Aerospace Corporation is a Federally Funded Research and Devel-
opment Center that works primarily for the Air Force.)

The Aerospace Corporation additionally found that a new telescope built from the
instruments  NASA  originally  planned  to  install  on  the  Hubble  would  provide  the
greatest  value  to  NASA  in  terms  of  risk  and  cost.  NASA  has  received  a  proposal,
known  has  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe,  to  build  such  a  telescope  from  the  instru-
ments that already exist at Goddard and some additional new equipment.

Recent  press  reports  have  suggested  that  in  its  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2006  budget  re-
quest, the Administration plans to cancel the robotic mission to service the Hubble,
presumably because of the costs and uncertainty about success, once again dooming
the telescope.

This hearing will help the Committee prepare for the debate over Hubble that will
come to a head once the budget request is released Feb. 7. There are basically four

options  available  with  regard  to  the  Hubble,  each  of  which  is  discussed  in  greater
detail later in this charter and in Attachment A:

4

• Do not service the telescope. The telescope will then cease to function as early
as  2007.  NASA  does  have  other  space  telescopes  in  orbit  and  others  are
planned  to  be  launched  in  2011,  but  none  has  the  same  capabilities  as
Hubble.

• Send  the  Shuttle  to  service  the  telescope.  Like  any  Shuttle  mission,  this

would put astronauts at risk. It would also delay completion of the ISS.

• Send  a  robotic  mission  to  service  the  telescope.  The  studies  mentioned  above
have  raised  grave  doubts  as  to  whether  this  mission  could  be  ready  in  time.
The contractor designing the robot takes issue with those studies.

• Launch  a  new  ‘‘platform’’  with  the  equipment  that  was  designed  to  be  added
to the Hubble (this is sometimes called ‘‘rehosting’’) and perhaps include new
equipment as well (the proposed ‘‘Hubble Origins Probe’’ or HOP). This would
leave  a  gap  in  Hubble  science,  as  the  new  platform  would  probably  not  be
ready until after the Hubble stopped operating.

All  of  these  options  raise  questions  about  cost  as  well  as  risk.  But  arguably  (see
below),  they  all  cost  in  the  range  of  $2  billion  to  complete.  Any  option,  therefore,
raises  questions  about  whether  Hubble  servicing  is  a  high  enough  priority  to  pro-
ceed  even  if  it  would  take  funds  away  from  NASA’s  other  science  plans  and  its  ex-
ploration mission.

Finally,  regardless  of  which  option  is  chosen,  NASA  will  have  to  send  a  robot  up
to  the  Hubble  around  2013  to  de-orbit  it.  Otherwise,  the  telescope  will  re-enter  the
Earth’s  atmosphere  uncontrolled,  potentially  causing  death  and  destruction  upon
landing. Designing a robot for de-orbiting the Hubble is much less complicated than
designing  one  to  service  the  telescope,  and  much  more  time  is  available  for  the
project as the Hubble is not expected to fall out of orbit for many years.
2. Overarching Questions

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1. How important are the contributions that would be expected from extending
the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  to  the  continued  advancement  of  our
understanding of the cosmos?

2. What  are  the  comparative  costs,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  of  a  Shuttle
servicing  mission,  a  robotic  servicing  mission,  and  a  mission  to  fly  elements
of a Hubble servicing mission rehosted on a new telescope?

3. Should  either  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  (whether  by  robot  or  by  Shuttle)
or  a  new  Hubble-based  telescope  be  a  higher  priority  for  funding  than  other
astronomical programs at NASA?

Academy’s  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Survey  Committee.  Dr.  Taylor  also  served
on the Academy’s Hubble Committee that was chaired by Dr. Lanzerotti.

4. Issues

These  are  some  of  the  questions  that  need  to  be  evaluated  in  deciding  what  to

do about the Hubble:

• How important is it to have the Hubble Telescope’s life extended and
its  capabilities  enhanced?  Every  ten  years  astronomers  come  together
under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences to survey their field and
develop  a  list  of  priority  research  questions  to  be  pursued  and  funded  by
NASA  (the  ‘‘decadal  survey’’).  The  most  recent  decadal  survey,  released  in
2001, assumed that Hubble would be serviced in 2004 and be available to sci-
entists until around 2010. Some of the priority projects were expected to work
in  conjunction  with  Hubble.  It  is  unclear  how  the  priorities  in  the  decadal
survey would shift if Hubble servicing were canceled, of if servicing (by Shut-
tle or robot) were to take funds from other planned science missions. It is also
unclear  where  a  project  like  HOP  would  rank  among  the  options  for  astron-
omy.

• How much time does NASA have to send a mission to the Hubble be-
fore  it  can  no  longer  be  rescued?  When  the  Hubble’s  batteries  will  run
too  low  to  protect  the  telescope  from  the  frigid  temperatures  of  space  cannot
be predicted precisely. The National Academy of Sciences’ Hubble report pro-
jected  that  the  batteries  would  most  likely  run  low  by  May  2009.  The  Aero-
space  Corporation  reached  similar  conclusions.  The  ability  of  the  Hubble  to
perform  science  is  likely  to  erode  sooner,  mostly  likely  in  April  2008,  accord-
ing  the  Academy.  NASA  could  extend  the  life  of  the  batteries  somewhat  by
putting the telescope into a ‘‘dormant’’ mode in anticipation of a servicing mis-
sion.  Any  servicing  mission  that  arrived  after  the  batteries  ran  down  would
be pointless.

• How much time would a robotic mission to service Hubble take to de-
velop?  Predicting  how  long  a  complex  space  mission  will  take  to  develop  is
fraught  with  uncertainty.  The  Aerospace  Corporation  estimated  that  a  mis-
sion  to  service  the  Hubble  robotically  would  not  be  ready  to  launch  for  at
least  65  months,  or  5.4  years,  too  late  to  rescue  the  Hubble  telescope.  NASA
claims,  however,  that  its  robotic  mission  will  be  ready  in  only  39  months,  or
3.25 years.

The crux of the dispute is the question of how novel a Hubble robotic mis-
sion  would  be.  NASA  and  MD  Robotics  point  out  that  the  ‘‘arm’’  the  robot
would  use  has  already  been  developed  and  used  by  the  Shuttle.  Skeptics
argue  that  the  ‘‘arm’’  has  not  been  used  for  an  analogous  mission  and  ren-
dezvousing  with  the  Hubble  gently  enough  to  avoid  damaging  it  will  be
tricky.

• How  much  time  would  a  Shuttle  mission  to  service  Hubble  take  to
prepare  for?  NASA  has  estimated  that  it  would  take  31  months  to  prepare
a Shuttle mission to Hubble, which includes crew training and having a back-
up  Shuttle  available  for  any  rescue  mission  (a  new  approach  in  the  wake  of
the Columbia accident). The Academy concluded that the latest a Shuttle mis-
sion to Hubble could launch and still save the telescope was May 2009.

• Where  would  the  funding  come  from  to  pay  for  a  servicing  mission
to Hubble? Past Hubble servicing missions have been paid out of the Shuttle
program’s  budget.  Since  the  last  Shuttle  was  sent  to  the  Hubble  in  2002,
NASA  has  adopted  a  new  bookkeeping  method  in  which  each  program  must
pay for activities that benefit it, even if those activities are carried out by an-
other program. Under this ‘‘full cost accounting’’ methodology, NASA’s Science
Directorate  might  be  expected  to  pay  for  all  or  part  of  a  Shuttle  mission  to
service  the  Hubble.  In  the  meantime,  the  funding  for  the  robotic  servicing
mission—contracts  have  already  been  let  to  design  the  robot—is  being  split
between  NASA’s  Science  Directorate,  in  which  the  Hubble  program  resides,
and the Exploration Directorate, which hopes to benefit from the robotic tech-
nology  that  the  Hubble  mission  would  develop.  (The  Exploration  Directorate
is  charged  with  developing  new  technology  for  the  President’s  proposal  to  re-
turn humans to the Moon.) If money for Hubble servicing started eating into
other  planned  science  projects,  support  for  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  in  the
science community might erode.

• How  much  would  a  servicing  mission  to  Hubble  cost?  Which  mission
provides  the  highest  value?  According  to  The  Aerospace  Corporation,  the
total cost of a robotic servicing mission would be roughly $2 billion. NASA es-
timated  the  cost  at  $1.3  billion.  The  initial  contracts  for  the  robotic  mission
have  come  in  at  less  than  Aerospace  had  estimated,  but  some  of  those  con-
tracts allow for cost escalation as the project continues.

According to NASA, the cost of a Shuttle servicing mission to Hubble would
cost  a  similar  amount,  $2.2  billion.  This  is  basically  NASA’s  estimate  of  the
cost  of  any  Shuttle  flight,  not  an  estimate  of  costs  unique  to  a  Hubble  mis-
sion.  Aerospace  did  not  conduct  an  independent  estimate  of  the  cost  of  a
Shuttle  servicing  mission.  The  Government  Accountability  Office  has  said  it
cannot verify NASA’s estimates of Shuttle costs.

The Aerospace Corporation found that a simple ‘‘rehosting’’ option—sending
up just the instruments already built to be added to Hubble—would also cost
about the same amount, roughly $2 billion. Proponents of HOP, which would
include additional equipment, claim that their proposal would cost about $1.5
billion.

The Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY05 that the President signed in De-
cember  specifically  included  $291  million  to  begin  work  on  the  robotic  serv-
icing  mission,  which  would  be  expected  to  launch  in  FY07.  According  to  its
latest  Operating  Plan,  NASA  plans  to  allocate  $175  million  to  the  project  in
FY05.

• Would  a  Shuttle  flight  to  Hubble  be  riskier  than  one  to  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station?  The  NASA  Administrator  has  said  that  his  deci-
sion  not  to  send  Shuttle  to  the  Hubble  was  based  in  large  part  on  his  belief
that  astronauts  would  face  a  greater  risk  on  such  a  mission  compared  to  a
mission  to  the  International  Space  Station.  NASA  has  never  provided  any
data  to  back  up  that  assertion  but  it  appears  to  be  based  on  the  assumption
that  the  ISS  can  act  as  a  ‘‘safe  haven’’  in  the  event  that  a  problem  with  the
Shuttle  is  discovered  during  a  mission.  (Shuttles  sent  to  the  Hubble  cannot
reach the ISS.) Some critics have charged that the Shuttle mission to Hubble
was  scrapped  solely  to  accelerate  the  construction  of  the  ISS.  The  National
Academy  of  Sciences  found  that  the  difference  in  risk  between  a  single  mis-
sion  to  Hubble  and  a  mission  to  the  Space  Station  is  ‘‘very  small.’’  Further-
more,  the  Academy  pointed  out  that  NASA  plans  to  send  the  Shuttle  to  the
Space Station 25 to 30 more times. The probability of another accident occur-
ring  in  30  flights  can  be  calculated  to  be  greater  than  40  percent  if  the  past
accident rate of the Shuttle (two in 113 flights) is used to predict future reli-
ability.  In  addition,  some  experts  have  argued  that  proposed  missions  to  the
Moon  and  Mars  are  likely  to  pose  much  greater  risks  to  astronauts  than  a
Shuttle mission to the Hubble.

5. Background
The Hubble Space Telescope:

The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  was  launched  from  the  Space  Shuttle  Dis-
covery  in  1990  and  has  operated  continuously  in  orbit  for  the  past  14  years.  The
Hubble  was  originally  designed  for  a  15-year  mission,  but  until  recently  NASA  in-
tended to extend its operations through 2010. The telescope was designed to be serv-
iced  by  astronauts,  and  a  series  of  four  Shuttle  servicing  missions,  the  last  flown
in 2002, have replaced nearly all of the key components except the original telescope
mirrors  and  support  structures.  Three  of  the  four  servicing  missions  added  major
new instruments, boosting the telescope’s observing capabilities.

HST is one of the most powerful optical astronomical telescopes ever built. It was
designed  to  make  observations  in  the  visible,  ultraviolet,  and  near-infrared  wave-
length portions of the spectrum, and its orbit above the Earth’s blurring atmosphere
provides an unobscured and undistorted view of the Universe.

In  its  report,  the  Academy  cited  as  the  Hubble’s  primary  scientific  achievements:

• Direct observation of the universe as it existed 12 billion years ago;
• Measurements that helped to establish the size and age of the universe;
• Discovery of massive black holes at the center of many galaxies;
• Key evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which can be
explained  only  by  the  existence  of  a  fundamentally  new  type  of  energy  and
therefore new physics; and

• Observation of proto-solar systems in the process of formation.

Prior  to  the  Columbia  Shuttle  accident,  NASA  had  scheduled  a  servicing  mission
(SM–4)  slated  for  2004  to  replace  the  batteries,  gyroscopes  and  fine  guidance  sen-
sors, all of which are showing signs of failure. SM–4 was also to install new thermal
blankets  and  two  new  science  instruments,  the  Wide  Field  Camera  3  (WFC3)  and
the  Cosmic  Origins  Spectrograph  (COS).  The  Shuttle  would  also  have  raised
Hubble’s orbit. After performing these repairs and new instruments, NASA expected
the Hubble would continue to operate for another three to five years.

Hubble is not the only space-based astronomical observatory, though it is only one
that  operates  in  optical  wavelengths.  The  Spitzer  Space  Telescope,  which  NASA
launched  in  August  2003,  has  a  2.5-year  mission  and  is  designed  to  observe  in  the
infrared  portion  of  the  spectrum.  NASA  launched  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory
in  July  1999.  While  Chandra  had  only  a  five-year  mission,  it  has  been  operating
past  its  planned  lifetime  and  continues  to  perform  well  today.  The  next  telescope
mission, scheduled for launch in 2011, is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
It  will  observe  in  the  infrared  portion  of  the  spectrum  using  the  largest  mirror  (six
meter diameter) ever flown in space. (As all of these telescopes were designed after
1986, none relies on the Shuttle for launch or requires servicing.) Scientists greatly
value  the  ability  to  do  complementary  observations  using  any  or  all  of  these  active
telescopes,  peering  at  the  same  target  at  the  same  time.  When  the  Hubble  oper-
ations cease, there will be no other space-based optical telescope available.
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board:

Following  the  Columbia  accident  in  February  2003,  NASA  appointed  the  Colum-
bia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to investigate the accident. The CAIB’s re-
port  included  15  Return-To-Flight  (RTF)  recommendations  that  it  said  should  be
completed  prior  to  NASA  resuming  Shuttle  flights,  and  an  additional  14  rec-
ommendations to assure continued safe operation.

At  times,  NASA  has  argued  that  its  decision  to  cancel  the  Shuttle  mission  to
Hubble  was  the  only  option  available  in  light  of  the  CAIB  report.  And  the  CAIB
did make some distinctions between missions to the ISS and other missions.

The  clearest  example  is  in  its  recommendation  6.4–1,  which  states  in  part,  ‘‘For
non-Station missions, develop a comprehensive autonomous (independent of Station)
inspection  and  repair  capability  to  cover  the  widest  possible  range  of  damage  sce-
narios.’’ NASA has not developed that capability. But at the request of Senator Bar-
bara  Mikulski  of  Maryland,  Admiral  Harold  Gehman,  the  Chairman  of  the  CAIB,
clarified the recommendation.

In  a  March  2004  letter,  Gehman  said  that  risk  to  the  Shuttle  needed  to  be  re-
viewed in light of all of CAIB’s recommendations, not just a single recommendation,
and  he  said  the  wording  of  the  specific  recommendation  for  non-Station  missions
meant ‘‘do the best you can.’’ He said non-ISS missions ‘‘may be slightly more risky’’
than  missions  to  the  ISS.  Admiral  Gehman  said  that  the  CAIB  had  taken  no  posi-
tion on the feasibility of a Hubble mission and that all Shuttle missions posed risks.
He concluded, ‘‘I suggest only a deep and rich study of the entire gain/risk equation
can answer the question of whether an extension of the life of the wonderful Hubble
telescope  is  worth  the  risks  involved,  and  that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  letter.’’
Gehman’s response was one impetus for the Academy study.
The Academy Report:

NASA  commissioned  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study  in  the  spring  of
2004,  in  response  to  Congressional  requests  and  shortly  after  initiating  efforts  to
study the feasibility of a robotic servicing mission. NASA asked the National Acad-
emy  of  Sciences  to  assess  ‘‘the  viability  of  a  Space  Shuttle  servicing  mission’’  that
would satisfy all of the CAIB’s and NASA’s own additional safety recommendations.
The Academy was also asked to consider the viability of a robotic servicing mission.
The  Academy’s  panel,  The  Committee  on  the  Assessment  of  Options  for  Extending
the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope (the full charter and a list of committee mem-
bers are attached), made three recommendations:

1. That  NASA  should  commit  to  a  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble  Space  Tele-
scope  that  accomplishes  the  objectives  of  the  originally  planned  SM–4  mis-
sion.

2. That  NASA  should  send  the  Shuttle  to  service  the  Hubble  as  soon  as  pos-

sible.

3. That a robotic mission approach should be pursued solely to de-orbit Hubble

after its mission is completed.

The  Academy  expressed  strong  doubts  about  the  likely  success  of  NASA’s  plans
for a robotic servicing mission, stating: ‘‘Based on extensive analysis, the committee
concluded that the very aggressive schedule for development of a viable robotic serv-

icing  mission,  the  commitment  to  development  of  individual  elements  with  incom-
plete  systems  engineering,  the  complexity  of  the  mission  design,  the  current  low
level  of  technology  maturity,  the  magnitude  of  the  risk-reduction  efforts  required,
and the inability of a robotic servicing mission to respond to unforeseen failures that
may  well  occur  on  Hubble  between  now  and  the  mission,  together  make  it  unlikely
that NASA will be able to extend the service life of HST through robotic servicing.’’
Robotics experts at NASA and its contractors dispute the Academy’s characteriza-
tion  of  the  overall  level  of  technical  maturity  of  the  robotic  mission’s  components.
For  instance,  they  argue  that  the  Shuttle’s  robotic  arm  (on  which  the  robotic  arm
for the servicing mission will be based) has suffered no mission failures in 25 years
of  use.  They  also  contend  that  the  Academy’s  assessment  of  robotics  risk  is  out  of
date since it is based on information and site visits that occurred during late spring/
early  summer  2004.  Developments  since  then,  they  say,  have  eliminated  many  of
the risks.

In  recommending  that  NASA  conduct  a  servicing  mission  with  the  Shuttle,  the
Academy  suggested  that  to  minimize  risk,  NASA  should  prepare  to  use  two  Shut-
tles—one to fly to Hubble, and the second to sit at the ready on an adjacent launch
facility to be used as a rescue vehicle should the first suffer damage that precludes
a safe return. This was based on a rescue scenario outlined in the CAIB report.

NASA argues that this proposal is not feasible because it would increase the cost
of  the  mission,  further  disrupt  the  schedule  for  completing  the  International  Space
Station,  and  put  additional  crew  at  risk  as  the  rescue  mission  would  be  unprece-
dented.  Any  rescue  mission  would  have  to  be  launched  quickly  (within  17–30  days,
depending on how much emergency power was available on the Shuttle). Astronauts
would  have  to  be  transferred  in  space  from  one  Shuttle  to  another,  a  task  NASA
views  as  without  precedent.  However,  the  Academy  report  found  that  spacewalks
‘‘for transferring the crew from a damaged vehicle on a Shuttle HST flight, although
complex, are well within the experience base of the Shuttle program.’’
The Aerospace Corporation Report:

The Academy panel relied heavily on a study produced by The Aerospace Corpora-
tion that analyzed a variety of alternative methods for extending the life of Hubble.
The  report  was  requested,  and  paid  for,  by  NASA  as  an  analysis  of  alternatives
(AoA).

Aerospace used a ‘‘blank sheet of paper’’ approach that considered generic options
rather than any specific pending proposal. As a result, it did not review the specific
robotics  work  underway  for  the  Hubble  mission,  which  was  only  in  an  early  stage
when the Aerospace study was done in any event. (The Aerospace Report was com-
pleted in August, 2004.) Aerospace also did not review NASA’s cost or schedule esti-
mates for the Shuttle, but simply accepted them as a baseline.

Aerospace  was  not  charged  with  recommending  a  specific  alternative,  but  only
with  ranking  their  relative  costs  and  benefits.  Key  findings  of  the  Aerospace  study
include:

• Robotic servicing alternatives, based on estimated development schedules, are
susceptible  to  arriving  too  late  when  Hubble  is  no  longer  in  a  serviceable
state.  Furthermore,  they  undertake  unprecedented  servicing  operations  and
are  subject  to  an  aging  observatory  that  may  fail  for  some  other  reason  fol-
lowing servicing.

• Rehost  alternatives  are  lower  risk  with  similar  cost  to  the  robotic  servicing

missions, but may result in a two- to seven-year science gap.

• SM–4  has  costs  in  the  same  range  as  the  rehost  and  robotic  servicing  alter-
natives,  has  higher  probability  of  mission  success  than  the  robotic  servicing
missions,  and  does  not  suffer  from  the  gap  in  science  associated  with  rehost
alternatives.

• Other  means  to  perform  astronaut  servicing  with  reduced  risk  such  as
launching  a  safe  haven  or  relocating  Hubble  to  the  vicinity  of  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  are  more  costly  and  take  longer  to  develop  than  SM–
4.

(Aerospace Corporation defines ‘‘Development Risk’’ for a servicing mission as the
risk  that  the  mission  can  be  developed  in  time  to  reach  the  Hubble  before  irrep-
arable  damage  occurs.  Aerospace  defines  ‘‘Mission  Risk’’  for  a  servicing  mission  as
the risk that every element of the mission will succeed as planned and the telescope
will continue to operate for another three years after being serviced.)
6. Recent Developments

NASA continues to work on a robotic servicing mission, for which the FY05 Omni-
bus Appropriations bill provided $291 million. Of this amount, NASA plans to spend
$175  million  through  Preliminary  Design  Review,  scheduled  for  late  March—the
stage at which a decision is normally made as to whether to carry on with a project.
Another  critical  stage  in  the  program’s  development,  the  Critical  Design  Review,  is
tentatively scheduled for this September.

NASA  recently  let  contracts  valued  at  $330  million  to  Lockheed  Martin  to  begin
development  work  on  a  spacecraft  that  could  be  used  for  either  a  robotic  servicing
mission  or  a  comparatively  simple  robotic  de-orbiting  mission.  A  contract  valued  at
$153 million was let to MD Robotics, a subsidiary of the Canadian firm MacDonald
Dettwiler,  to  develop  the  robotic  arm  that  would  perform  any  servicing.  The  com-
pany built the existing Shuttle robotic arm.
7. Questions Asked of the Witnesses

cy’s  alternatives  in  servicing  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  In  particular
please  explain  the  comparative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing  mission,  a  robotic  servicing  mission,  and  a  mission  to  fly  elements  of

2. How confident are you of your cost estimates for each of the options?

Dr. Lou Lanzerotti, Chairman

Please  explain  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  your  panel’s  assessment  of
options  for  extending  the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  with  a  particular  em-
phasis on the following questions:

1. What is the telescope’s contribution to science and what would be lost if the

telescope were not to be serviced and no replacement telescope launched?

2. What  are  the  comparative  costs,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  of  a  Shuttle
servicing  mission,  a  robotic  servicing  mission,  and  a  mission  to  fly  elements
of a Hubble servicing mission rehosted on a new telescope?

3. How  disruptive  to  science  would  it  be  if  Hubble’s  new  instruments  were  to
be unavailable for a number of years? Would any of your panel’s findings and
recommendations change if NASA were unable to launch a Shuttle servicing
mission in time to prevent a ‘‘gap’’ in Hubble science?

4. How  would  you  personally,  or  on  behalf  of  the  Committee,  evaluate  a  free

flyer (rehosting) instead of a servicing mission?

Dr. Steve Beckwith

1. How important are the contributions that would be expected from extending
the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  when  compared  to  advancements  ex-
pected  from  other  astronomical  programs  at  NASA  to  be  launched  in  the
next decade, such as the James Webb Space Telescope?

2. What  are  the  comparative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  a  Shuttle  servicing
mission,  a  robotic  servicing  mission,  and  a  mission  to  fly  elements  of  a
Hubble servicing mission rehosted on a new telescope?

3. Should  either  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  (whether  by  robot  or  by  Shuttle)
or a new telescope as the Hubble Origins Probe be a higher priority for fund-
ing than other astronomical programs at NASA?

Dr. Paul Cooper, General Manager

Please describe the robotic mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope that you
are  helping  to  develop  for  NASA  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  following  ques-
tions:

1. To  what  extent  do  you  agree  or  disagree  with  the  assessment  by  The  Aero-

space Corporation of a robotic servicing mission?

2. What  are  the  costs,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  of  the  robotic  servicing  mis-
sion,  compared  to  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  and  a  mission  to  fly  elements
of a Hubble servicing mission rehosted on a new telescope?

Dr. Colin Norman

Please  briefly  describe  your  proposal  for  NASA  to  build  and  fly  a  new  telescope
called  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  following  ques-
tions:

1. How,  if  at  all,  does  your  proposal  differ  from  those  analyzed  by  The  Aero-

space Corporation?

2. What  contributions  could  your  proposed  telescope  make  to  science  compared
to  those  that  could  be  made  by  the  Hubble  if  it  were  serviced  by  either  the
Shuttle or a robotic servicing mission?

3. What are the comparative costs, strengths, and weaknesses of your proposal,

a Shuttle servicing mission and a robotic servicing mission?

Dr. Joseph H. Taylor, Jr.

1. To what extent, and in what ways, was the Decadal Survey premised on the
Hubble Space Telescope having additional instruments that were to be added
by  a  servicing  mission?  Would  the  loss  of  the  Hubble  cause  you  to  entirely
rethink  your  priorities?  Would  that  change  if  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe  or
a similar rehost mission is launched?

2. How important are the contributions that would be expected from extending
the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  when  compared  to  advancements  ex-
pected  from  other  astronomical  programs  at  NASA  to  be  launched  in  the
next decade, such as the James Webb Space Telescope?

Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the

Life of the Hubble Space Telescope

Statement of Task

The  committee  will  conduct  an  independent  assessment  of  options  for  extending
the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  The  study  will  address  the  following  tasks:
1. Assess the viability of a Space Shuttle servicing mission that will satisfy all
recommendations  from  the  CAIB  (Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board),
as well as ones identified by NASA’s own Return-to-Flight activities. In mak-
ing  this  assessment,  compare  the  risks  of  a  space  Shuttle  servicing  mission
to  HST  with  the  risks  of  a  Shuttle  mission  to  the  ISS  and,  where  there  are
differences, describe the extent to which those differences are significant. Es-
timate to the extent possible the time and resources needed to overcome any
unique  technical  or  safety  issues  associated  wit  HST  servicing  that  are  re-
quired  to  meet  the  CAIB  recommendations,  as  well  as  those  from  the  Staf-
ford-Covey team.

2. Survey  other  available  engineering  options,  including  both  on-orbit  robotic
intervention  and  optimization  of  ground  operations,  that  could  extend  the
HST lifetime.

3. Assess  the  response  of  the  spacecraft  to  likely  component  failures  and  the
resulting impact on servicing feasibility, lost science, and the ability to safely
dispose of HST at the end of its service life.

4. Based upon the results of the tasks above, provide a benefit/risk assessment
of  whether  extension  of  HST  service  life,  via  (a)  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission
if  one  id  deemed  viable  under  task  #1  and/or  (b)  a  robotic  servicing  mission
if  one  is  deemed  viable  under  task  #2,  is  worth  the  risks  involved.  The  as-
sessment  should  include  consideration  of  the  scientific  gains  from  different
options  considered  and  of  the  scientific  value  of  HST  in  the  larger  context
of  ground  and  space-based  astronomy  and  science  more  broadly.  Special  at-

tention should be paid to the practical implications of the limited time avail-
able for meaningful intervention robotically or via the Shuttle.

The  committee  is  not  expected  to  make  either  organization  or  budgetary  rec-
ommendations, but it may need to consider cost as a factor in weighing the relative
benefits of alternative approaches.

The  committee  will  investigate  the  possibility  of  providing  an  interim  report  to
NASA that addresses a portion of the items in the task statement in advance of de-
livering a full final report if such an approach is deemed feasible and able to provide
early, credible answers to the questions being considered.

Committee on the Assessment of Options for Extending the

Life of the Hubble Space Telescope

Recommendations
1. The committee reiterates the recommendation from its interim report that NASA
should commit to a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope that accom-
plishes the objectives of the originally planned SM–4 mission.

2. The  committee  recommends  that  NASA  pursue  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to
HST  that  would  accomplish  the  above  stated  goal.  Strong  consideration  should
be given to flying this mission as early as possible after return-to-flight.

3. A robotic mission approach should be pursued solely to de-orbit Hubble after the
period  of  extended  science  operations  enabled  by  a  Shuttle  astronaut  servicing
mission,  thus  allowing  time  for  the  appropriate  development  of  the  necessary
robotic technology.

Findings
Chapter 3—The Impact of Hubble: Past and Future
• The  Hubble  telescope  is  a  uniquely  powerful  observing  platform  because  of  its
high angular optical resolution, broad wavelength coverage from the ultraviolet to
the  near  infrared,  low  sky  background,  stable  images,  exquisite  precision  in  flux
determination, and significant field of view.
• Astronomical  discoveries  with  Hubble  from  the  solar  system  to  the  edge  of  the
universe  are  one  of  the  most  significant  intellectual  achievements  of  the  space
science program.
• The scientific power of Hubble has grown enormously as a result of previous serv-
• The growth in the scientific power of Hubble would continue with the installation
of the two new instruments, Wide Field Camera-3 (WFC3) and the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (COS), planned for SM–4.
• A  minimum  scientifically  acceptable  servicing  mission  would  install  batteries,
• Ground-based  adaptive  optics  systems  will  not  achieve  Hubble’s  high  degree  of
image stability or angular resolution at visible wavelengths for the foreseeable fu-
ture.

gyros, WFC3, and a FGS. The installation of COS is highly desirable.

icing missions.

• Servicing Hubble expeditiously is highly desirable.

Chapter 4—HST Observatory Assessment and Lifetime Projection
• The HST avionics system is currently in a fully operable state and retains redun-
dancy  on  all  subsystems.  Its  performance  is  monitored  regularly  and  is  well  un-
derstood  by  the  operations  team  where  it  is  possible  to  credibly  forecast  system
performance, failure trends, and replacement requirements.
• Previous  human  servicing  missions  have  successfully  carried  out  unforeseen  re-
pairs  as  well  as  executing  both  planned  and  proactive  equipment  and  scientific
upgrades. The current excellent operational status of the observatory is a product
of these past efforts.
• The  robotic  mission  plan  presented  by  NASA  accomplishes  the  minimum  mission
servicing goals of installing batteries, gyros, and scientific instruments and poten-
tially  a  fine-guidance  sensor,  but  does  not  install  other  important  life-extension
upgrades  that  were  also  planned  for  SM–4.  It  is  also  unclear  whether  the  fine
guidance  sensor  replacement  or  unforeseen  repairs  can  be  effected  on  a  robotic
mission without exceptional mission complexity and associated telescope risk.

at least a 50 percent chance for success.

• The flexibility for repairing unforeseen anomalies has been demonstrated on past
Shuttle servicing mission. With this flexibility, the avionics system is projected to
operate  with  a  reliability  value  of  0.69  at  three  years  and  0.45  at  five  years  in
support of science operations following a Shuttle servicing mission.

• The  baseline  robotic  mission  is  judged  to  have  minimal  capacity  for  responding
to  and  repairing  unforeseen  anomalies.  Assuming  robotic  servicing  in  February
2009  (based  on  a  5.4  year  ‘‘most  likely’’  readiness  date),  the  system  reliability  is
projected  to  be  0.41  at  the  time  of  servicing,  0.18  after  three  years  of  post-serv-
icing science operations, and less than 0.10 at five years.

• Battery lifetime trends are consistent with supporting science operations through
April  2008  and  maintaining  the  telescope  optical  system  in  a  highly  protected
Level-1 safe-hold state until July 2009. Loss of capability to do science due to opti-
cal  failure  is  most  likely  to  occur  in  the  May  2011  timeframe  but  could  occur  as
early as December 2009 based on a worst-case projection.

• If  HST  operations  continue  as  they  are,  progressive  gyroscope  failures  are  likely
to terminate observatory science operations around September 2007. Timely tran-
sition  to  a  2-gyro  mode  after  software  validation  in  the  first  half  of  2005  could
extend science operations into the mid-2008 timeframe.

• HST gyro replacement by the Shuttle is a straightforward operation that has been
accomplished  successfully  on  past  servicing  mission.  Replacement  by  a  robotic
mission is more complex, entailing the attachment of multiple RSU and ECU ele-
ments plus interface electronics on to the WFC3 instrument. The interface to the
spacecraft  system  is  made  via  an  external  cable  routed  to  a  test  interface  on  the
telescope computer.

• FGS–2R  is  projected  to  fail  in  the  October  2007  to  October  2009  timeframe.  Its
replacement  is  important  if  FGS  redundancy  is  to  be  retained  to  support  post-
servicing  science  operations.  Replacement  of  FGS–2R  is  straightforward  on  a
Shuttle  mission  but  considered  to  be  high  risk  for  a  robotic  mission.  Therefore,
it  is  possible  to  retain  FGS  redundancy  by  Shuttle  servicing  and  potentially  is
possible via robotic servicing.

• FGS–3  is  projected  to  fail  in  the  January  2010  to  January  2012  timeframe  al-
though its life can potentially be extended through the near-term use of FGS–2R.
Failure in this timeframe will not strongly affect post-servicing science operations
if FGS–2R is replaced.

• Solar  Panel  performance  is  running  according  to  expected  trends  such  that  suffi-
cient power will be available to support HST science operations until at least 2014
in the case of either Shuttle or robotic servicing.

• Retention  of  Reaction  Wheel  Assembly  redundancy  is  important  to  maximize  the
likelihood of three to five years of post-servicing HST science operations. Replace-
ment of RWA units has been performed successfully in response to an unexpected
anomaly on two pervious Shuttle mission and is also possible, if required, on SM–
4.  Replacement  of  an  RWA  is  not  part  of  the  planned  robotic  mission  and  may
not be possible due to the RWA mounting locations on the telescope.

• Analysis  in  combination  with  long-term  avionics  monitoring  predicts  that  radi-
ation damage should not interfere with science operations through the 2010 time-
frame.  Adverse  radiation  effects  after  2010  are  more  likely,  with  an  increasing
risk  of  avionics  component  failures  if  science  operations  are  extended  until  2014.
• The  projected  termination  in  mid  to  late  2007  of  science  operations  due  to  gyro-
scope  failure  and  the  projected  readiness  in  early  2010  to  execute  the  planned
NASA robotic mission result in a projected 29-month interruption of science oper-
ations.  No  interruption  of  science  operations  is  projected  for  a  realistically  sched-
uled SM–4 Shuttle mission.

• The  planned  NASA  robotic  mission  is  less  capable  than  the  previously  planned
SM–4  mission  with  respect  to  its  response  to  unexpected  failures  and  its  ability
to  perform  proactive  upgrades.  Combined  with  the  projected  schedule  for  the  two
options, the mission risk associated with achieving at least three years of success-
ful  post-servicing  science  operations  is  significantly  higher  for  the  robotic  option
with  the  respective  risk  numbers  at  three  years  being  approximately  30  percent
for the SM–4 mission and 80 percent for the robotic mission.

Chapter 5—HST Robotic Servicing Assessment
• The  technology  required  for  the  proposed  HST  robotic  servicing  mission  involves
a level of complexity, sophistication, and maturity that requires significant devel-
opment, integration, and demonstration to reach flight readiness and has inherent
risks  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  need  to  service  Hubble  as  soon  as  possible.
• Technologies  needed  for  proximity  operations  and  autonomous  rendezvous  and

capture have not been demonstrated in a space environment.

• The addition of targets and fiduciaries and a better latching system by the astro-
nauts on the SM–4 mission will enhance the ability of the subsequently launched
de-orbit  module  to  dock  with  the  HST  and  provide  a  more  precise  alignment  for
de-orbit.

• The  control  algorithms  and  software  for  lidar  and  camera  based  control  of  the

grapple arm are mission-critical technologies that have not been flight-tested.

• Technologies  needed  for  autonomous  manipulation,  disassembly  and  assembly,
and for control of manipulators based on vision and force feedback have not been
demonstrated in space.

• The Goddard Space Flight Center HST project has a long history of HST Shuttle
servicing experience, but little experience with autonomous rendezvous and dock-
ing  or  robotic  technology  development,  or  with  the  operations  required  for  the
baseline HST robotic servicing mission.

• The proposed HST robotic servicing mission involves a level of complexity that is
inconsistent  with  the  current  39-month  development  schedule  and  would  require
an  unprecedented  improvement  in  development  performance  compared  with  that
of  space  missions  of  similar  complexity.  The  likelihood  of  successful  development
of the HST robotic servicing mission within the baseline 39-month schedule is re-
mote.

• ‘‘Conclusion’’:  The  very  aggressive  schedule  for  development  of  a  viable  robotic
servicing mission, the commitment to development of individual elements with in-
complete  systems  engineering,  the  complexity  of  the  mission  design,  the  current
low  level  of  technology  maturity,  the  magnitude  of  the  risk-reduction  efforts  re-
quired,  and  the  inability  of  a  robotic  servicing  mission  to  respond  to  unforeseen
failures  that  may  well  occur  on  Hubble  between  now  and  the  mission,  together
make it unlikely that NASA will be able to extend the science life of HST through
robotic servicing. (page 74).

• Many  of  the  concerns  raised  by  the  committee  regarding  the  risk  of  attempting
to robotically service the Hubble telescope could be mitigated for future programs
through planning for robotic servicing in the initial spacecraft design.

Chapter 6—Space Shuttle Servicing of Hubble
• A  complete  inspection  of  the  orbiter  thermal  protection  system  can  be  accom-
plished  on  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  HST  using  the  SRMS  (Shuttle  remote
manipulator system) and the SRMS/OBSS (orbiter boom sensor system).

• The  orbiter  thermal  protection  system  repairs  can  be  accomplished  on  a  Shuttle
servicing  mission  to  HST  following  the  development  of  worksite  and  repair  tech-
niques for ISS (International Space Station) to meet the CAIB (Columbia Accident
Investigation Board) and NASA requirements.

• The  ISS  safe  haven  offers  operational  flexibility  and  time  to  adapt  to  real-time
problems  in  the  case  of  a  critical  ascent  impact  event  that  is  both  detected  and
repairable,  or  that  affords  the  option  of  a  Shuttle  rescue  mission.  However,  the
availability  of  the  ISS  safe  haven  is  zero-fault-tolerant,  requires  significant  pre-
positioning  of  supplies,  and  therefore,  has  significant  risks  due  to  its  limited  re-
dundancy and margins.

• An  HST  Shuttle  rescue  mission  can  be  ready  on  the  second  launch  pad.  There
would  be  some  costs  and  ISS  schedule  delays,  principally  because  of  the  impact
of parallel orbiter processing. Limited time would be available to execute a rescue.
• Meeting the CAIB and NASA requirements (relative to inspection and repair, safe
haven,  Shuttle  rescue,  orbital  debris,  and  risk  to  the  public)  for  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing mission to HST is viable.

• The  extravehicular  activities  (spacewalks)  for  transferring  the  crew  from  a  dam-
aged vehicle on a Shuttle HST flight, although complex, are well within the expe-
rience base of the Shuttle program.

• To avoid putting the Hubble at risk and to maintain continuous science operation
the  HST  servicing  mission  could  be  flown  as  early  as  the  seventh  flight  after  re-
turn-to-flight without a critical operational impact on the ISS.
• Major  HST  mission  preparation  work  for  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  HST  can
be deferred until after return-to-flight. This would avoid a significant expenditure
of human resources until the Shuttle is flying again.
• Compared  to  the  total  cost  of  flying  a  Shuttle  flight,  the  resources  required  to
overcome unique technical or safety issues involved in flying a Shuttle mission to
HST  are  small  and  are  well  within  the  experience  base  of  work  done  in  the  past
to enable unique Shuttle missions.
• ‘‘Comment’’: The committee believes that careful planning for, and implementation
of,  the  additional  HST-unique  activities  to  meet  the  CAIB  and  NASA  require-
ments will result in substantially lower actual costs to service the HST using the
Shuttle  than  those  projected  above.  [NASA  estimates  of  $1.7B–$2.4B.]  (Page  87).
• The Shuttle crew safety risks of a single mission to ISS and a single HST mission
• In  the  case  of  every  documented  anomaly  encountered  during  the  conduct  of
extravehicular  activities  (EVAs)  on  all  four  HST  missions,  the  onboard  crew,  in
conjunction  with  its  ground-based  mission  control  team,  worked  around  each
anomaly and successfully completed every task planned for these missions.
• Space  Shuttle  crews,  in  conjunction  with  their  ground-based  mission  control
teams, have consistently developed innovative procedures and techniques to bring
about  desired  mission  success  when  encountering  unplanned  for  or  unexpected
contingencies on-orbit.

are similar and the relative risks are extremely small.

• The risk in the mission phase of a Shuttle HST servicing mission is low.

Chapter 7—Benefit/Risk Assessment of Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Options
• Although  a  quantitative  mission  risk  assessment  does  not  exist  for  either  a
human or a robotic servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, the commit-
tee’s qualitative evaluations lead it to conclude that the human servicing mission
poses  a  low  risk  to  mission  success.  Conversely,  the  robotic  mission  risk  is  high,
considering  the  short  time  frame  available  for  system  development  and  testing,
and the uncertainty concerning robotic performance.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  hearing  will  come  to  order.  I  want  to
welcome everyone here this morning for our hearing on the vexing
question  of  what  to  do  about  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  Here  is
our  quandary.  On  the  one  hand,  everyone  acknowledges  that  the
Hubble  has  been  a  sparkling  jewel  in  the  crown  of  American
science,  but  on  the  other,  there  is  disagreement  about  how  and
whether  to  save  it,  and  that  disagreement  will  come  to  a  head  in
the  coming  weeks,  once  the  proposed  budget  for  Fiscal  2006  is  re-
leased.  Regardless  of  whether  it  actually  zeros  out  a  Hubble  mis-
sion,  as  has  been  widely  rumored.  So  our  goal  this  morning  is  to
do our homework for the upcoming debate. We have before us lead-
ing authorities on the Hubble, representing a variety of viewpoints,
and  their  answers  to  our  questions  will  help  Congress  choose
among  the  options  for  the  Hubble:  letting  it  die,  saving  it  with  a
Shuttle  mission,  saving  it  with  a  robotic  mission,  or  sending  up  a
new version of the telescope.

I  think  that  Congress  faces  three  fundamental  questions  regard-
ing  the  Hubble  in  today’s  fiscal  environment.  The  broadest  is,  is
Hubble—is  it  worth  saving  the  Hubble  even  if  that  means  taking
money  away  from  other  NASA  programs  such  as  exploration?  Sec-
ond,  and  more  narrowly,  we  need  to  ask  is  it  worth  saving  the
Hubble  even  if  that  means  taking  money  away  from  other  NASA
science  programs?  And  finally,  if  the  answer  to  either  of  those
questions is yes, then we need to ask what is the best way to save
the  Hubble,  or  at  least  its  science,  in  terms  of  costs  and  risk?  I
come  to  today’s  hearing  as  an  agnostic  on  all  three  questions.  The
first  question  on  my  list,  about  the  priority  of  Hubble  in  relation
to  other  NASA  programs,  is  in  some  ways  beyond  the  scope  of  to-
day’s  hearing,  but  what  we  will  hear  today  will  help  us  evaluate
it. As I said, I don’t have a view on that right now, but let me reit-
erate  that  I  think  all  aspects  of  space  science  and  Earth  science
need  to  be  viewed  as  continuing  priorities  for  NASA,  even  as  the
Exploration  Initiative  moves  forward.  If  the  ultimate  payoff  of  ex-
ploration  is  a  changed  view  of  the  world  and  of  the  universe,  then
science like that performed by Hubble certainly is a model of explo-
ration.

We  will  get  some  answers  today  to  the  second  question  on  my
list,  about  Hubble’s  relation  to  other  science  priorities.  Astronomy
is a model for other fields in its creation of a consensus list of prior-
ities  for  every  decade.  Dr.  Taylor,  in  his  written  testimony,  gives
a  remarkably  clear  and  straightforward  answer  to  our  question
about  science  priorities,  and  let  me  thank  you,  Dr.  Taylor.  I  will
be  very  interested  to  hear  our  other  witnesses  comment  on  his
thoughts.

Finally,  on  the  narrow  question  of  how,  rather  than  whether  to
save  the  Hubble,  I  am  also  eager  to  hear  our  witnesses  interact
today.  I  am  especially  eager  to  hear  Dr.  Lanzerotti’s  response  to
Mr.  Cooper’s  testimony  about  the  feasibility  of  robotics,  and  Dr.
Norman’s  responses  to  Dr.  Lanzerotti’s  testimony  about  the  viabil-
ity of ‘‘rehosting’’ the Hubble instruments. So, I hope we can clarify
today what is at stake in upcoming Hubble debate.

I would dearly love to save the telescope. It has outperformed ev-
eryone’s  fondest  hopes,  and  has  become  a  kind  of  mascot  for
science,  maybe  even  for  our  planet.  One  can’t  help  but  root  for  it.

I  will  always  remember  when  Sean  O’Keefe  and  I  were  having
lunch  in  the  Member’s  dining  room  one  day  last  year,  and  one  of
the  waiters  came  up  to  him,  and  said:  ‘‘Save  the  Hubble.’’  And  I
didn’t  put  him  up  to  it.  But  this  can’t  be  an  emotional  decision  or
one  based  on  what  we  would  do  in  an  alternative  universe  that
lacked fiscal constraints or uncertainty.

We  have  to  make  hard  choices  about  whether  a  Hubble  mission
is  worth  it  now,  when  moving  ahead  is  likely  to  have  an  adverse
impact on other programs, including quite possibly other programs
in astronomy. The whole matter is, as I said at the outset, vexing.
I  hope  that  by  the  end  of  this  hearing,  I  will  be  better  prepared
to help make those hard choices.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I want to welcome everyone here this morning for our hearing on the vexing ques-
tion  of  what  to  do  about  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  Here’s  our  quandary:  On  the
one hand everyone acknowledges that the Hubble has been a sparkling jewel in the
crown  of  American  science,  but  on  the  other  there  is  disagreement  about  how  and
whether to save it. And that disagreement will come to a head in the coming weeks
once  the  proposed  budget  for  fiscal  2006  is  released—regardless  of  whether  it  actu-
ally zeros out a Hubble mission, as has been widely rumored.

So our goal this morning is to do our homework for the upcoming debate. We have
before  us  leading  authorities  on  the  Hubble,  representing  a  variety  of  viewpoints.
And their answers to our questions will help Congress choose among the options for

Second,  and  more  narrowly,  we  need  to  ask:  Is  it  worth  saving  the  Hubble  even  if
that  means  taking  money  away  from  other  NASA  science  programs?  And  finally,  if
the answer to either of those questions is yes, then we need to ask: What’s the best
way to save the Hubble (or at least its science) in terms of cost and risk.

I come to today’s hearing as an agnostic on all three questions.
The  first  question  on  my  list—about  the  priority  of  Hubble  in  relation  to  other
NASA programs—is in some ways beyond the scope of today’s hearing, but what we
hear today will help us evaluate it. As I said, I don’t have a view on that now. But
let  me  reiterate  that  I  think  all  aspects  of  space  science  and  Earth  science  need  to

hard  choices  about  whether  a  Hubble  mission  is  worth  it  now,  when  moving  ahead
is likely to have an adverse impact on other programs, including quite possibly other
programs in astronomy. The whole matter is, as I said at the outset, vexing. I hope
that  by  the  end  of  this  hearing,  I’ll  be  better  prepared  to  make  those  hard  choices.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr.  GORDON.  Good  morning,  and  I  would  like  to  join  the  Chair-

man in welcoming the witnesses to today’s hearing.

We have important—an important issue to address this morning,
namely,  the  future  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  The  Hubble
Space  Telescope  has  been  one  of  the  world’s  premier  scientific  in-
struments  for  more  than  a  decade.  Observations  made  by  Hubble
have greatly expanded our knowledge of the universe, and continue
to rewrite the textbook in astronomy.

Thus,  it  was  a  surprise  to  me  when  NASA  Administrator  last
year cancelled the long-planned mission to service and upgrade the
Hubble telescope. That cancellation led to a large outcry from both
scientists  and  the  public  at  large,  and  I  guess  even  a  few  waiters
in the House dining room. And through the efforts of Senators and
Representatives  of  both  parties,  including  our  own  Representative,
Mark  Udall,  NASA  became  aware  of  the  intense  Congressional  in-
terest in the future of Hubble.

As  a  result,  the  NASA  Administrator  asked  the  National  Acad-
emies  to  undertake  a  review  of  the  options  for  extending  the  life
of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  as  well  as  whether  it  makes  sense
for—from  a  scientific  standpoint  to  do  so.  The  National  Academies
accepted  the  challenge,  and  assembled  a  very  distinguished  com-
mittee to conduct the review. They delivered their report last year,
and  Dr.  Lanzerotti,  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  will  present
their findings and recommendations today.

I  must  say  that  I  was  very  impressed  with  both  the  quality  and
the  clarity  of  the  Committee’s  report.  The  Committee  worked  its
way  through  a  very  complex  set  of  issues,  and  wound  up  issuing
a  very  clear  set  of  findings  and  recommendations.  Dr.  Lanzerotti
and  his  Committee,  as  well  as  the  National  Academies’  staff,  de-
serve our thanks for a job well done.

And  at  this  point,  I  think  the  burden  of  proof  has  to  be  placed
on  anyone  who  would  differ  markedly  from  their  conclusions.  In
that  regard,  I  am  disappointed  that  NASA  was  not  invited  to  to-
day’s  hearing.  I  think  we  need  to  hear  how  NASA  views  the  Na-
tional  Academies  report,  and  how  it  plans  to  respond  to  its  rec-
ommendations.  For  example,  the  National  Academies  Committee
concluded that, and I quote: ‘‘The Shuttle crew safety risk of a sin-
gle  mission  to  ISS  and  a  single  HST  mission  are  similar,  and  the
relative  risks  are  extremely  small.’’  Does  NASA  agree  or  disagree
with that conclusion, or for that matter, how would NASA compare
the risk of having astronauts service Hubble with the risk of send-
ing  astronauts  back  to  the  surface  of  the  Moon,  and  how  would  it
compare the benefits?

In  addition,  there  are  concerns  within  the  scientific  community
that  funding  a  Hubble  service  mission  would  force  deep  cuts  in
other  planned  space  science  initiatives.  However,  when  I  asked
NASA Administrator O’Keefe to answer for the record whether the
Shuttle-related  costs  of  the  SM4  Hubble  Servicing  Mission  would
have  to  come  out  of  the  scientific  budget,  his  response  was  as  fol-
lows,  and  I  quote:  ‘‘This  long-planned  servicing  mission  is  consid-

ered  grandfathered—grandfathered  in.  Under  this  policy  and  the
projected  budget  for  the  mission  was  included—in  the  five  year
budget  run-out  under  the  Office  of  Space  Flight.’’  Where  did  the
money  go?  And  is  NASA  management  now  planning  to  walk  away
from  an  earlier  budgetary  commitment  to  the  NASA  science  pro-
gram on the allocation of the Hubble servicing cost?

These  questions  take  on  increased  importance  in  the  current
budgetary environment. We have all heard reports that the funding
for  the  servicing  Hubble  would  not  be  in  NASA’s  FY  2006  budget
request in order to free up money for other initiatives, such as the
President’s  Exploration  Initiative.  We  will  know  within  a  week
whether  or  not  these  reports  are  accurate.  If  they  are,  and  I  think
this Congress will need to take a hard look at the priorities behind
such  a  cut.  While  I  support  human  exploration  beyond  low-Earth
orbit, I want the Administration to make sure that it is adequately
paid  for,  and  not  funded  by  simply  canceling  or  cutting  other  im-
portant  activities  in  NASA  non-exploration  science  and  technology
accounts.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  morning’s  hearing  will  be  this  House  Com-
mittee’s  first  hearing  on  space  issues  in  the  109th  Congress.  I  am
confident  it  will  not  be  the  last.  There  are  a  whole  host  of  issues
related  to  NASA  and  the  Nation’s  space  and  aeronautics  program
that  need  Congress’  attention.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you
and the rest of the Committee to address those issues.

And in closing, I would like to once again welcome our witnesses,

and I look forward to their testimony.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Good morning. I’d like to join the Chairman in welcoming the witnesses to today’s
hearing. We have an important issue to address at this morning’s hearing—namely,
the future of the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Hubble Space Telescope has been one of the world’s premier scientific instru-
ments  for  more  than  a  decade.  Observations  made  with  Hubble  have  greatly  ex-
panded our knowledge of the universe—and continue to rewrite the textbooks in as-
tronomy!

Thus, it was a surprise to many when the NASA Administrator last year canceled
the  long-planned  mission  to  service  and  upgrade  the  Hubble  telescope.  That  can-
cellation  led  to  a  large  outcry  from  both  scientists  and  the  public  at  large.  And
through  the  efforts  of  Senators  and  Representatives  of  both  parties,  including  our
own Rep. Mark Udall, NASA became aware of the intense congressional interest in
the future of Hubble.

As a result, the NASA Administrator asked the National Academies to undertake
a review of the options for extending the life of the Hubble Space Telescope—as well
as  whether  it  made  sense  from  a  scientific  standpoint  to  do  so.  The  National  Acad-
emies  accepted  the  challenge,  and  it  assembled  a  very  distinguished  committee  to
conduct  the  review.  They  delivered  their  report  late  last  year,  and  Dr.  Lanzerotti,
the Chair of that committee, will present their findings and recommendations today.
I must say that I was very impressed with both the quality and the clarity of the
committee’s  report.  The  committee  worked  its  way  through  a  very  complex  set  of
issues and wound up issuing a very clear set of findings and recommendations. Dr.
Lanzerotti and his committee, as well as the National Academies staff, deserve our
thanks for a job well done.

At  this  point,  I  think  that  the  burden  of  proof  has  to  be  placed  on  anyone  who
would differ markedly with their conclusions. In that regard, I am disappointed that
NASA was not invited to today’s hearing.

I think we need to hear how NASA views the National Academies report, and how
it  plans  to  respond  to  its  recommendations.  For  example,  the  National  Academies
committee concluded that:

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

21

‘‘The Shuttle crew safety risks of a single mission to ISS and a single HST mis-
sion are similar and the relative risks are extremely small.’’

Does NASA agree or disagree with that conclusion? Or for that matter, how would
NASA compare the risks of having astronauts service Hubble with the risks of send-
ing astronauts back to the surface of the Moon? And how would it compare the ben-
efits?

In  addition,  there  are  concerns  within  the  scientific  community  that  funding  a
Hubble  servicing  mission  would  force  deep  cuts  in  other  planned  space  science  ini-
tiatives.  However,  when  I  asked  NASA  Administrator  O’Keefe  several  years  ago  to
answer  for  the  record  whether  the  Shuttle-related  costs  of  the  SM–4  Hubble  serv-
icing mission would have to come out of the science budget, his response was as fol-
lows:

‘‘This long-planned servicing mission is considered ‘grandfathered in’ under this
policy,  and  the  projected  budget  for  the  mission  was  included  in  the  five-year
budget runout under the Office of Space Flight.’’
[Source:  Record  of  2/27/02  Hearing  with  NASA  Administrator  O’Keefe,  p.  166]
Where did that money go? And is NASA management now planning to walk away
from its earlier budgetary commitment to the NASA science program on the alloca-
tion of Hubble servicing costs? These questions take on increased importance in the
current budgetary environment.

We have all heard reports that funding for servicing Hubble will not be in NASA’s
FY  2006  budget  request  in  order  to  free  up  money  for  other  activities,  such  as  the
President’s exploration initiative. We will know within a week whether or not those
reports are accurate. If they are, I think that this Congress will need to take a hard
look at the priorities behind such a cut.

While  I  support  human  exploration  beyond  low-Earth  orbit,  I  want  the  Adminis-
tration  to  make  sure  that  it  is  adequately  paid  for  and  not  funded  by  simply  can-
celing  or  cutting  other  important  activities  in  NASA’s  non-exploration  science  and
technology accounts.

Mr. Chairman, this morning’s hearing will be the Science Committee’s first hear-
ing  on  a  space  issue  in  the  109th  Congress.  I  am  confident  that  it  will  not  be  the
last—there  are  a  whole  host  of  issues  related  to  NASA  and  the  Nation’s  space  and
aeronautics programs that need Congress’s attention. I look forward to working with
you and the rest of the Committee to address those issues.

In closing, I’d again like to welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to your tes-

timony. Thank you.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Gordon,  and
just  let  me  tell  you.  We  intentionally  did  not  invite  NASA  for  two
basic reasons. One, they are unlikely to say anything much of sub-
stance  in  advance  of  the  release  of  the  budget,  and  secondly,  we
wanted  to  hear  about  hearing  all  the  options,  not  about  Adminis-
tration  policy,  and  so  that  is  what  this  hearing  is  designed  to  do,
expose us to the various options.

With  that,  let  me  proudly  introduce  the  new  Chairman  of  the
Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Mr. Calvert of California.
Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  today’s
hearing  on  the  future  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  There  is  no
doubt  that  the  Hubble  is  a  national  treasure,  extraordinary  sci-
entific  instrument.  It  opened  up  our  eyes  and  has  dazzled  us  with
images  of  galaxies,  stars,  and  planets.  The  Hubble  has  also  fun-
damentally  changed  our  understanding  of  the  universe,  and  forced
scientists to rethink many of their own theories. Thanks to Hubble,
we  have  caught  glimpses  of  black  holes.  We  have  watched  comets
slam  into  Jupiter.  We  have  seen  stars  born  and  stars  die.  These
are just a few examples of Hubble’s accomplishments.

Not  since  Galileo  first  peered  into  the  looking  glass  nearly  400
years ago has a single telescope made such a difference in the way
we  see  the  heavens.  Now,  I  am  all—sure  that  we  all  agree  that
Hubble  is  great,  but  I  suspect  there  may  be  differing  opinions  on

what  should  be  done  going  forward.  The  Hubble’s  life  is  limited.
The  window  of  opportunity  to  service  it  is  narrow,  and  the  costs
and  risks  for  servicing  a  mission  are  significant.  It  is  valuable  to
understand  and  weigh  the  options  which  may  extend  the  Hubble
Space  Telescope’s  useful  lifespan.  It  is  essential  that  we  fully  un-
derstand  the  comparative  costs,  strengths  and  weaknesses,  of  a
Shuttle  servicing  mission,  a  robotic  servicing  mission,  and  a  mis-
sion  to  fly  elements  of  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  rehosted  on  a
new  telescope.  In  addition,  an  open  and  healthy  debate  about  how
a Hubble servicing mission, whether by robot or by Shuttle, should
be  prioritized  against  funding  for  other  astronomy  programs  at
NASA is welcome.

While  the  Hubble  amazing  journey  will  some  day,  eventually,
come  to  an  end,  it  will  not  end  the  story,  just  as  Galileo’s  looking
glass wasn’t the last telescope, the next chapter will feature bigger,
better,  and  more  capable  observatories,  which  will  provide  even
more amazing discoveries.

Again,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  assembling  this  out-
standing panel. I look forward to their testimony. I look forward to
working  with  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  and  addressing  the
Hubble  Space  Telescope  and  other  important  issues  in  the  109th
Congress.  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  you  gave  me.  I  want  to
apologize in advance. I must leave around 11:15 to attend a Steer-
ing Committee, which will be deciding how the appropriations side
of this process is going to work, and so, that is also important, so—
but  I  look  forward  to  being  fully  briefed  on  this  after  the  hearing.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE KEN CALVERT

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding today’s hearing on the future of the Hubble
Space  Telescope.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Hubble  is  a  national  treasure  and  an
extraordinary scientific instrument. It has literally opened our eyes to the Universe
and dazzled us with images of galaxies, stars, and planets. The Hubble has also fun-
damentally  changed  our  understanding  of  the  Universe,  and  forced  scientists  to  re-
think  many  of  their  theories.  Thanks  to  Hubble,  we’ve  caught  glimpses  of  black
holes,  we’ve  watched  comets  slam  into  Jupiter,  we’ve  seen  stars  being  born  and
stars die, and these are but a few examples of Hubble’s accomplishments. Not since
Galileo first peered into his looking glass nearly 400 years ago has a single telescope
made such a difference in the way we see the heavens.

Now,  I’m  sure  we  all  agree  that  the  Hubble  is  great,  but  I  suspect  there  may  be
differing  opinions  on  what  should  be  done  going  forward.  The  Hubble’s  life  is  lim-
ited,  the  window  of  opportunity  to  service  it  is  narrow,  and  the  costs  and  risks  for
a  servicing  mission  are  significant.  It  is  valuable  to  understand  and  weigh  the  op-
tions  which  may  extend  the  Hubble  space  telescope’s  useful  lifespan.  It  is  essential
that  we  fully  understand  the  comparative  costs,  strengths,  and  weaknesses  of  a
Shuttle servicing mission, a robotic servicing mission, and a mission to fly elements
of  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  placed  on  a  new  telescope.  In  addition,  an  open  and
healthy debate about how a Hubble servicing mission, whether by robot or by Shut-
tle,  should  be  prioritized  against  funding  for  other  astronomy  programs  at  NASA
is welcome.

While  the  Hubble’s  amazing  journey  will  some  day  eventually  come  to  an  end,  it
will  not  be  the  end  of  the  story,  just  as  Galileo’s  looking  glass  wasn’t  the  last  tele-
scope.  The  next  chapter  will  feature  bigger,  better,  and  more  capable  observatories
which will provide even more amazing discoveries.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for  assembling  this  outstanding  panel.  I  look  forward
to  their  testimony,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  on  the  Com-
mittee in addressing the Hubble Space Telescope and other important issues in the

Now  I  want  to  apologize  at  the  outset  for  not  being  able  to  stay  for  the  entirety
of today’s hearing as I have important and requisite work to attend to as a Member
of  the  House  Steering  Committee.  I  do  look  forward  to  getting  briefed  on  the  full
debate from today’s proceedings at a later time.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Calvert.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee

to examine the options for the future of the Hubble Space Telescope.

This committee is privileged to have jurisdiction over our space programs because
we have the opportunity to consider funding requests to develop new capabilities for
exploration  on  behalf  of  all  Americans.  We  strive  to  involve  all  Americans  in  our
efforts  by  sharing  publicly  in  our  challenges  and  our  successes.  Working  in  collabo-
ration  with  NASA,  The  Aerospace  Corporation,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,
scientists,  and  other  space  industries,  it  is  important  that  this  committee  under-
stands  the  contributions  and  expectations  for  continued  funding  for  the  Hubble
Space  Telescope.  In  order  to  ensure  tax-payer  dollars  are  being  spent  wisely,  it  is
imperative  that  we  continually  evaluate  and  assess  the  effectiveness  of  our  space
programs  and  servicing  missions.  Thus,  we  need  to  listen  to  the  recommendations
and positions from our experts in the field.

I  am  aware  that  Members  of  the  science  community  are  concerned  that  a  serv-
icing mission to Hubble might come at the expense of other planned projects within
NASA’s  science  program  if  the  science  office  had  to  absorb  all  the  costs  of  a  serv-
icing mission.

I  am  pleased  the  Committee  is  having  this  hearing  today  because  it  will  help  us
prepare  for  future  hearings  once  the  Administration’s  budget  request  is  released
next week. I am aware of the possibility that a robotic mission to service the Hubble
Space  Telescope  may  be  dropped  from  the  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget.  With  four  op-
tions available to determine the course in which the Hubble Telescope will be fund-
ed, it is critical we examine each proposal very carefully.

I look forward to hearing the testimony from our panel of witnesses.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Chairman Boehlert. I thank the Chairman for calling this very impor-
tant meeting. In addition, I would like to thank our distinguished group of witnesses
for agreeing to testify here today on Options for the Hubble Telescope.

The  space  exploration  research  program  has  been  one  of  the  most  successful  re-
search  programs  in  the  history  of  this  country.  Because  of  it,  our  nation  benefited
many  lifesaving  medical  tests,  accessibility  advances  for  the  physically  challenged,
and products that make our lives more safe and enjoyable.

The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  is  a  national  asset.  Scientists  all  over  the  world  use
the  orbiting  observatory  to  get  a  view  of  the  universe  that  they  can’t  get  any  other
way.  This  telescope  has  already  made  major  contributions  to  the  science  of  astron-
omy.

However, on Saturday, Jan. 17 2004, NASA announced they will not send a sched-
uled servicing team to the Hubble Space Telescope, and instead will crash this great
scientific instrument into the ocean in 2008.

NASA, now strapped for funding, will not make the scheduled 2006 Shuttle to re-

pair failing gyroscopes and batteries.

The  resulting  void  created  by  not  scheduling  badly  needed  repairs  to  the  Hubble
leaves many questions about how we will continue our space exploration and obser-
vation programs.

I pledge to do what I can to help our space program so these important endeavors
can be achieved and the space program can flourish in the future. As a Senior mem-
ber of the Science Committee, I will work closely with my House colleagues to assist
NASA in meeting their goals.

I am a firm believer that the United States will continue our space program that

has accomplished so much in the areas of research and science.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

I’m glad to have this opportunity to express my strong support for keeping Hubble

alive and for making it more productive than it has ever been.

We all remember when Administrator O’Keefe first announced the cancellation of
the  Hubble  servicing  mission.  There  was  a  tremendous  outcry  from  the  academic
community and scientists worldwide, as well as from the general public.

Congress also expressed great concern and fought the Administrator’s decision. A
resolution  I  introduced  last  year  urging  NASA  to  appoint  an  independent  panel  of
experts to review options for carrying out the servicing mission drew 77 co-sponsors.
So I was pleased when Administrator O’Keefe saw the value in Hubble’s future sci-
entific productivity and decided to look into a number of servicing options. Congress
backed  him  on  the  decision  to  keep  Hubble  alive,  providing  nearly  $300  million  in
FY05 for a repair mission.

In  my  view,  the  best  news  of  last  year  for  Hubble  was  when  the  National  Re-
search  Council  report  called  it  ‘the  most  powerful  astronomical  facility  ever  built,’
and recommended that NASA commit to a Shuttle servicing mission to Hubble, one
that would accomplish the objectives planned for the original mission, including the
installation of the two new instruments.

So it was with great concern that I learned about NASA’s plans to zero out fund-
ing  for  a  repair  mission  in  FY06.  After  all  that  we  have  learned  from  the  Hubble
assessment  report  and  all  that  we  know  about  Hubble’s  potential  to  produce  even
more  spectacular  science  for  years  to  come,  it  is  incomprehensible  to  me  that  this
Administration  would  so  hastily  ignore  the  panel’s  scientific  recommendations  and
shut down the planned repair mission.

It is unfortunate that we don’t have a NASA witness on the panel, but I look for-
ward to hearing from all the witnesses today about how they view Hubble’s future.
In  particular,  I’d  like  to  express  my  appreciation  to  Dr.  Lanzerotti  and  the  other
members  of  the  Hubble  assessment  panel  for  the  hard  work  and  careful  analysis
that went into their report. I’d also like to thank Steve Beckwith for his dedication
to Hubble and for all that he does to help produce its amazing science and imagery.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  bringing  us  together  today  with  this  superb  panel
of  witnesses  to  examine  the  quandary  of  what  to  do  with  the  Hubble  Space  Tele-
scope  (HST).  I  am  honored  to  sit  with  you  for  the  first  time  during  my  tenure  as
a  Member  of  the  House  of  Representatives  and  I  look  forward  to  serving  the  third
Congressional district of Missouri on the Committee on Science.

The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  has  opened  the  eyes  of  astronomers  and  the  public
alike to faraway galaxies, new discoveries in the field of astrophysics and never seen
before imagery.

Today,  we  will  hear  about  the  options  available  for  coping  with  the  upcoming
Hubble  battery  failure,  which  is  anticipated  to  be  as  early  as  2007.  Various  advo-
cates propose the following four options: not service the station (which requires that
we  still  de-orbit  Hubble);  send  an  astronaut-manned  Shuttle  to  service  the  station;
send  a  robotic  mission  to  service  the  station;  or  launch  a  new  spacecraft  and  inte-
grate portions of the existing telescope into the new one. I come to this hearing with
no particular preconceived notions about which option is preferable.

In  the  future,  we  will  have  important  decisions  to  make  about  the  Hubble  Space
Telescope’s relative worth to the scientific field, the financial cost of various options,
human safety involved in a potential Shuttle mission, and the reliability of a robotic
mission.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  testimony  of  the  panelists  and  hearing  their
counsel  on  how  to  best  balance  these  multiple  concerns  while  working  to  advance
the scientific knowledge that Hubble has brought the world. Thank you.

First  commissioned  into  service  in  1990,  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  is  by  all
measures an extraordinary success in terms of the contributions it has made to fur-
ther  our  understanding  of  astronomy,  space  science,  and  physics.  Hubble’s  place-
ment above the atmosphere allows it to focus in on distant bodies free of the atmos-
pheric  interference  that  affects  all  ground  based  telescopes.  This  gives  Hubble  the
ability  to  collect  data  in  the  ultraviolet  and  near  infrared  that  are  filtered  by  the
atmosphere. Even at optical wavelengths, the Hubble produces images that are cur-
rently unmatched in clarity by any other telescope.

A  study  by  the  National  Academies  chaired  by  Dr.  Lanzerotti  reviewed  the  pop-
ular  press  and  peer-reviewed  publications  and  found  that  Hubble-generated  data
contributed  to  a  number  of  astronomical  ‘firsts’  or  the  experimental  confirmation  of
previously  proposed  theories.  Hubble  currently  has  1500  registered  users,  and  re-
quest for access exceeds that available by a factor of seven.

The  adage  that  ‘‘a  picture  is  worth  a  thousand  words’’  applies  to  the  Hubble  be-
yond the 19 terabytes of data already collected. The spectacular images we have all
seen  have  no  doubt  inspired  countless  numbers  of  students  to  consider  future  ca-
reers  in  science  and  engineering—not  just  in  astronomy,  but  in  other  disciplines
that  have  contributed  to  the  design  and  operation  of  the  Hubble,  such  as  computer
science and engineering, physics, mechanical engineering, and robotics.

The  operation  of  the  Hubble  originally  anticipated  a  series  of  servicing  missions
involving  astronauts  and  equipment  transported  by  the  Space  Shuttle.  Three  serv-
icing  missions  have  been  successfully  and  safely  completed  involving  the  replace-
ment,  repair,  or  upgrade  of  many  of  the  key  components  of  the  original  telescope.
So many improvements have been made through these three previous missions that
the  National  Academies’  report  describes  today’s  Hubble  as  different  from  the  tele-
scope that was launched in 1990.

A  fourth  and  final  Shuttle  servicing  mission  was  originally  scheduled  for  2004–
2005. After the tragic loss of the Shuttle Columbia, Administrator O’Keefe canceled
plans  for  this  scheduled  servicing  mission.  The  scientific  community  criticized  this
decision  to  abandon  support  for  the  Hubble  and  NASA  proposed  a  robotic  servicing
mission  that  would  perform  the  essential  servicing  tasks  for  the  telescope’s  contin-
ued survival. Critical components, (e.g., batteries) are nearing their end of life, and
the  spacecraft  will  likely  fail  around  the  end  of  the  decade  without  their  replace-
ment.

Without  servicing,  it  is  estimated  that  the  Hubble’s  batteries  and  other  systems
will  cause  the  irreversible  deterioration  of  the  spacecraft  sometime  between  2008
and 2009. Even if no repairs are made, a robotic mission will be needed around 2013
to initiate the controlled safe de-orbit of the spacecraft.

Aside  from  the  option  to  forego  repairs,  the  National  Academies  and  The  Aero-
space Corporation have identified three repair scenarios, each of which is estimated
to cost approximately $2 billion. Those involve:

• Send  the  Shuttle  to  service  the  telescope.  Like  any  Shuttle  mission,  this

would put astronauts at risk. It would also delay completion of the ISS.

• Send  a  robotic  mission  to  service  the  telescope.  The  studies  mentioned  above
have  raised  grave  doubts  as  to  whether  this  mission  could  be  ready  in  time.
The contractor designing the robot takes issue with those studies.

• Launch  a  new  ‘‘platform’’  with  the  equipment  that  was  designed  to  be  added
to the Hubble (this is sometimes called ‘‘re-hosting’’) and perhaps include new
equipment as well (the proposed ‘‘Hubble Origins Probe’’ or HOP). This would
leave  a  gap  in  Hubble  science,  as  the  new  platform  would  probably  not  be
ready until after the Hubble stopped operating.

Cost  estimates  were  reviewed  by  the  General  Accountability  Office,  which  found

NASA’s justification for the lacking detail or unjustifiable.

Aside  from  the  cost  issues  raised  by  the  GAO,  I  am  extremely  concerned  about
the  safety  of  all  NASA  missions.  Administrator  O’Keefe  canceled  future  Shuttle
servicing  missions  because  such  missions  lack  ‘safe  haven’  access  to  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station.  A  robotic  servicing  mission  has  been  proposed,  but  the  Na-
tional Academies and The Aerospace Corporation have both criticized that approach
because  it  involves  the  development  unproven  technologies  that  may  not  be  avail-
able before irreversible deterioration occurs to the Hubble.

A third option to re-host ground based Hubble components in a new telescope also
has  uncertainties  and  involves  a  two  year  period  between  the  demise  of  an
unserviced Hubble and the commissioning of its replacement.

Our oversight responsibilities compel us to ask the hard questions that will foster
healthy  debate  on  the  issues  associated  with  these  options.  It  is  the  job  for  all  of

that does not cause unreasonable risks to our astronauts.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Today’s list of very distinguished witnesses
impresses even those of us who have been around here a long time,
and  I  want  to  thank  all  of  them  for  being  resources  for  this  com-
mittee.  And  I  want  to  thank  you  all  for  your  testimony  submitted
in  advance,  and  as  I  indicated  in  my  opening  statement,  Dr.  Tay-
lor, it is so refreshing to have someone do what you did in your tes-
timony,  give  us  some  guidance  on  priorities.  I  have  found  through
all  my  years  on  the  Committee  that  so  often,  there  is  a  reluctance
to assign any priorities to anything by the scientific community, be-
cause  everything  is  so  darn  important,  and  they  are  reluctant  to
assign a lower category to some other discipline, because there but
for  the  grace  of  God  go  I,  say  the  people  assigning  that.  So,  thank
you very much.

Our  witnesses  today  are  Mr.  Gary  Pulliam,  Vice  President  for
Civil  and  Commercial  Operation  for  The  Aerospace  Corporation;
Dr.  Lou  Lanzerotti,  Chair,  Committee  on  the  Assessment  of  Op-
tions for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope; Dr. Jo-
seph  Taylor,  Professor  of  Physics,  Princeton  University;  Dr.  Steve
Beckwith, Director, Space Telescope Science Institute and Professor
of  Physics  and  Astronomy  at  Johns  Hopkins  University;  Dr.  Paul
Cooper, Vice President and Deputy General Manager, MD Robotics;
and Dr. Colin Norman, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Johns
Hopkins University. Thank you all very much.

I  would  ask  that  you  try  to  summarize  your  statement.  The  en-
tire  statement  will  be  in  the  record  at  this  juncture,  in  relatively
five minutes or so. 300 seconds is not nearly adequate enough time
to  say  what  you  want  to  say,  but  if  you  can  summarize  the  state-
ments, that will give us more of an opportunity to pick your brains,
and  that  is  what  we  are  here—and  that  is  what  the  mission  is  all
about.

So with that, Mr. Pulliam, you are up first.

STATEMENT  OF  GARY  P.  PULLIAM,  VICE  PRESIDENT,  CIVIL
AND  COMMERCIAL  OPERATIONS,  THE  AEROSPACE  COR-
PORATION
Mr.  PULLIAM.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  Mr.  Gordon,
Committee Members and staff. I am pleased to represent The Aero-
space  Corporation  today,  and  to  appear  to  you—to  appear  before
you as you deliberate the future of the Hubble Space Telescope.

As  a  private,  nonprofit  corporation,  The  Aerospace  Corporation
has  provided  engineering  and  scientific  services  to  government
space  organizations  for  over  40  years.  We  provide  a  stable,  objec-
tive  expert  source  of  analysis.  We  are  focused  on  the  government’s
best  interests,  with  no  profit  motive  or  predilection  for  any  par-
ticular design or technical solution.

As  our  primary  activity,  Aerospace  operates  a  federally-funded
research and development center sponsored by the Under Secretary
of  the  Air  Force  and  managed  by  the  Space  and  Missile  Systems
Center  in  El  Segundo,  California.  Aerospace  also  undertakes
projects for NASA and other civil agencies that are in the national
interest and are consistent with our corporate rule.

In June 2004, Admiral Craig Steidle, the Associate Administrator
for Exploration Systems, asked Aerospace to perform an analysis of
alternatives  for  servicing  options  for  Hubble.  Today,  I  will  briefly
describe  the  characteristics  of  an  analysis  of  alternatives,  how  we
conducted this analysis, and our findings.

An  analysis  of  alternatives  is  a  formal  analytical  tool,  which
Aerospace  has  used  on  large  Department  of  Defense  space  pro-
grams.  An  analysis  of  alternatives  is  properly  used  to  compare  al-
ternatives, and to make broad conclusions based on analytical data.
However, the analysis does not evaluate specific programs, or their
execution  to  plans,  nor  does  it  recommend  specific  solutions  to  the
problem.

For this analysis of alternatives for Hubble, we adopted our proc-
esses  to  NASA’s  needs.  We  involved  key  stakeholders  in  our  anal-
ysis,  including  the  Hubble  program  office,  and  the  Office  of  Space
Science  Evaluation  team.  Our  measures  of  effectiveness  were  cost,
schedule,  development  risk,  mission  risk,  and  capability.  For  cost,
we used life cycle cost. For the schedule measure, we used develop-
ment  time.  Development  risk  is  the  combination  of  the  probability
that Hubble will still be in the required state for servicing, and the
development  time  of  the  particular  option.  In  other  words,  an  im-
portant element of the evaluation of servicing options is can we get
there before Hubble suffers a failure. The mission risk is the prob-
ability  of  mission  success  for  any  particular  alternative.  And  fi-
nally,  a  capability  measure  is  the  estimation  of  the  instrument  ca-
pability compared to the baseline of Hubble, should the next Shut-
tle servicing mission have flown.

We  combined  several  measures  into  an  analysis  of  expected
value,  to  examine  the  cost  benefit  of  each  alternative,  compared
with its probability of success. For this analysis, there are two im-
portant  dates  to  consider,  the  need  date  for  servicing  Hubble,
which  we  estimate  to  be  early  2009,  and  the  need  date  to  de-orbit
Hubble, which we estimate to be 2013.

Mr.  Chairman,  here  are  our  findings.  As  I  present  them,  I  am
mindful  of  the  Committee’s  request  for  me  to  compare  the
strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  various  approaches.  First,  a  dis-
posal  mission  is  required  to  provide  a  controlled  re-entry.  Without
this  mission,  Hubble  would  pose  an  unacceptable  casualty  risk  to
the  population.  A  disposal  mission  does  not  prolong  Hubble’s  life,
nor enhance its science capabilities. Our analysis is that a de-orbit
mission  would  cost  between  $300  million  and  $1.1  billion,  depend-
ing on the approach taken.

Second,  a  combined  robotic  servicing  and  de-orbit  mission  would
cost between $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, and carries high risk, be-
cause  of  the  time  required  to  develop  the  capability,  and  Hubble’s
likely  degradation  or  failure  in  2008  or  2009.  Strengths  of  this  al-
ternative  are  that  it  can  extend  Hubble’s  life  expectancy  and  en-
hance its science capabilities. Weaknesses in this approach are the
requirement to arrive at Hubble before failure, performing unprece-
dented  robotic  operations,  and  the  fact  that  Hubble  may  fail  for
some other reason even after a successful servicing mission.

Third,  rehosting  options,  meaning  launching  a  new  satellite  to
perform  the  science  mission,  would  cost  $1.9  and  $2.3  billion.  This
mission  is  technically  and  programmatically  feasible.  The  strength

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

28

is  that  this  option  does  not  depend  on  Hubble’s  condition.  The
weakness  is  that  there  would  be  a  period  of  several  years  where
we would have no science, and the new observatory might not have
as robust a capability as Hubble.

Fourth,  a  baseline  servicing  Shuttle  servicing  mission,  while  not
analyzed  by  Aerospace,  may  have  a  higher  probability  of  success
than  the  robotic  mission.  We  did  not  analyze  the  strengths  and
weaknesses of the Shuttle servicing mission, but we did present the
SM4 costs and schedule estimate as a baseline comparison. And fi-
nally, safe haven options, which might allow for astronaut servicing
missions, still do not remove all of the associated risks with human
space flight.

When viewed from the expected value perspective, missions such
as  a  rehost  mission  score  well,  because  the  launch  date  is  not  tied
to  Hubble’s  demise.  In  other  words,  these  missions  have  a  higher
probability  of  success,  because  there  is  no  requirement  to  get  to
Hubble by 2009. Robotic missions, while providing an enhanced ca-
pability,  score  lower  because  of  the  aggressive  development  sched-
ule  required  to  get  to  Hubble  before  it  fails,  and  because  of  the
higher  mission  risk.  And  as  mentioned  earlier,  a  de-orbit  mission
provides no enhanced capability.

Finally,  the  Committee  asked  me  to  address  our  confidence  in
our study. This analysis of alternatives used proven tools and prov-
en  approaches,  Aerospace’s  best  technical  experts  in  the  field,  and
went  through  the  rigorous  internal  review  process  at  Aerospace.  I
see  this  as  exemplary  of  Aerospace’s  finest  analytic  capability.
However, it is important for the Committee to realize that this was
an  analysis  of  alternatives,  not  an  examination  of 
the
programmatics  of  any  particular  program  presently  in  develop-
ment.

Our analysis was completed in August 2004. A new analysis per-
formed  today,  that  included  an  independent  assessment  of  the
progress  of  the  development  of  the  robotic  and  grapple  arm  would
certainly  refine  the  results,  but  in  our  opinion,  would  not  change
the  basic  fact  that  a  robotic  servicing  mission  is  a  challenging  un-
dertaking.

Now,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity

to summarize our report, and I look forward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Pulliam follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARY P. PULLIAM

Mr. Chairman, distinguished Committee Members and staff:

I  am  pleased  to  have  the  opportunity  to  share  with  you  the  findings  of  a  recent
Aerospace  Corporation  assessment  of  robotic  servicing  alternatives  for  the  Hubble
Space  Telescope.  Before  I  begin,  I  would  like  to  present  an  overview  of  Aerospace
and how we came to provide this study for NASA.
The Aerospace Corporation

The  Aerospace  Corporation  is  a  private,  nonprofit  corporation,  headquartered  in
El  Segundo,  California.  It  was  created  in  1960  at  the  recommendation  of  Congress
and  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  to  provide  research,  development  and  advisory
services  to  the  U.S.  government  in  the  planning  and  acquisition  of  space,  launch
and  ground  systems  and  their  related  technologies.  The  key  features  of  Aerospace
are  that  we  provide  a  stable,  objective,  expert  source  of  engineering  analysis  and
advice  to  the  government,  free  from  organizational  conflict  of  interest.  We  are  fo-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

29

cused  on  the  government’s  best  interests,  with  no  profit  motive  or  predilection  for
any particular design or technical solution.

As its primary activity, Aerospace operates a Federally Funded Research and De-
velopment Center sponsored by the Under Secretary of the Air Force, and managed
by  the  Space  and  Missile  Systems  Center  in  El  Segundo,  California.  Our  principal
tasks  are  systems  planning,  systems  engineering,  integration,  flight  readiness
verification, operations support and anomaly resolution for the DOD, Air Force, and
National  Security  Space  systems.  Through  our  comprehensive  knowledge  of  space
systems  and  our  sponsor’s  needs,  our  breadth  of  staff  expertise,  and  our  long-term,
stable relationship with the DOD, we are able to integrate technical lessons learned
across  all  military  space  programs  and  develop  systems-of-systems  architectures
that integrate the functions of many separate space and ground systems.

The  Aerospace  Corporation  also  undertakes  projects  for  civil  agencies  that  are  in
the  national  interest.  Such  projects  contribute  to  the  common  good  of  the  Nation
while  broadening  the  knowledge  base  of  the  corporation.  Aerospace  has  supported
many  NASA  assessments  of  human  and  robotic  space  programs,  addressing  tech-
nical, cost and schedule risks.

Aerospace  does  not  compete  with  industry  for  government  contracts,  and  we  do
not  manufacture  products.  The  government  relies  on  Aerospace  for  objective  devel-
opment  of  pre-competitive  system  specifications,  and  impartial  evaluation  of  com-
peting concepts and engineering hardware developments, to ensure that government
procurements can meet the military user’s needs in a cost-and-performance-effective
manner.

Aerospace employs about 3,450 people, of whom 2,400 are scientists and engineers
with  expertise  in  all  aspects  of  space  systems  engineering  and  technology.  The  pro-
fessional staff includes a large majority, 74 percent, with advanced degrees, with 29
percent  holding  Ph.Ds.  The  average  experience  of  Members  of  the  Technical  Staff
(MTS) is more than 25 years. We recruit more than two-thirds of our technical staff
from experienced industry sources and the rest from new graduates, university staff,
other  nonprofit  organizations,  government  agencies,  and  internal  degree  programs.
In  January  of  2004,  NASA  Administrator  Sean  O’Keefe  announced  the  cancella-
tion  of  one  last  planned  Space  Shuttle  mission  to  service  the  Hubble  Space  Tele-
scope. Under pressure from Congress and the public, NASA agreed to look for alter-
native ways to extend Hubble’s life.
Analysis of Alternatives

NASA  requested  that  The  Aerospace  Corporation  perform  a  nonadvocate  assess-
ment  of  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  robotic  servicing  alternatives.  These  alter-
natives  encompassed  a  broad  range  of  options  in  the  following  families:  ground  life
extension, disposal, rehosting instrumentation on other platforms, robotic servicing,
and  the  baseline  Shuttle  Servicing  Mission  4  (SM–4)  previously  planned  for  2005.
In  developing  this  Analysis  of  alternatives  (AoA),  Aerospace  assessed  each  alter-
native against a set of measures of effectiveness (MOEs), which included cost, sched-
ule,  risk,  and  the  resulting  capability  of  the  alternative  to  perform  science  relative
to the planned post-SM–4 baseline.
The key findings of this AoA are:

dress the risk associated with uncontrolled HST re-entry.

• Ground-based  life  extension  does  not  replace  instruments  and  does  not  ad-
• Disposal-only  alternatives  have  relatively  low  cost,  but  provide  no  HST  life
extension or added science capability comparable to the current configuration.
• Rehost  alternatives  provide  higher  value  at  equivalent  cost  to  the  robotic
servicing  missions,  but  may  result  in  a  two-  to  seven-year  science  gap.  This
higher value results from the lower development and mission risks.
• Robotic servicing alternatives, based on estimated development schedules, are
susceptible to arriving too late. HST may no longer be in a serviceable state.
Furthermore, they are subject to an aging observatory that may fail for some
other reason during the three years following servicing.
• SM–4  has  costs  in  the  same  range  as  the  rehost  and  robotic  servicing  alter-
natives,  has  higher  probability  of  mission  success  than  the  robotic  servicing
missions,  and  does  not  suffer  from  the  gap  in  science  associated  with  rehost
alternatives.1 Other  means  to  perform  SM–4  with  reduced  risk  by  launching
a  safe  habitat  or  relocating  HST  to  the  vicinity  of  the  International  Space

1 SM–4  was  not  analyzed  by  the  study  team  but  was  included  for  completeness  as  a  baseline
for  comparison.  SM–4  and  the  safe  habitat  approaches  have  unique  human  space  flight  risks
that  were  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study  and  therefore  not  assessed.  Furthermore  they  would
compete against the ISS Shuttle manifest.

Station  (ISS)  were  examined,  but  would  require  more  development  time  and
be more costly.

Introduction

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), launched in 1990, is the first and most widely
known  of  NASA’s  great  observatory  missions.  Orbiting  the  Earth  at  an  altitude  of
320 nautical miles, HST is the only orbiting observatory outside the Earth’s atmos-
phere  with  the  capability  to  observe  simultaneously  in  the  near-IR,  visible,  and  ul-
traviolet  wavelengths.  HST  observing  sensitivity  is  beyond  what  is  achievable,  in
most  cases,  with  Earth-based  telescopes,  and  its  achievable  angular  resolution
equals or surpasses state-of-the-art ground-based facilities. During its lifetime, HST
has produced detailed images of stars, galaxies, and nebulae that have led to major
scientific discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics, and have captured the public’s
imagination with spectacular views of the universe.

HST, whose subsystems and instruments were designed to be serviced on-orbit by
astronauts  using  the  Space  Shuttle,  has  been  visited  four  times  for  this  purpose
(Servicing Missions 1, 2, 3A, and 3B). The previous Shuttle servicing missions have
accomplished  a  broad  array  of  repairs  and  upgrades,  including  the  change-out  and
installation  of  newer,  more  capable  instruments,  replacing  solar  arrays,  batteries,
and flight computers, and adding new radiators and thermal shielding.

The next Space Shuttle servicing mission, Servicing Mission 4 (SM–4), was sched-
uled for 2005 and manifested to replace the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial
Replacement  (COSTAR)  and  Wide  Field  Planetary  Camera  2  (WFPC2),  with  the
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), respectively.
SM–4  would  also  further  extend  the  observatory’s  mission  life  by  replacing  failed
components and those components approaching their end of life.2 Due to safety con-
cerns surrounding the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and crew, NASA canceled
future Shuttle flights to HST and embarked on a process to assess other options in
order  to  understand  the  implications  of  HST’s  possible  eventual  demise,  including
that of an uncontrolled re-entry. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) took
the  lead  in  developing  a  non-Shuttle-based  servicing  approach,  using  robotic  tech-
nologies. This concept, known as the Hubble Space Telescope Robotic Servicing and
De-orbit  Mission  (HRSDM),  employs  robotic  vehicles  to  accomplish  the  major  serv-
icing elements of the canceled SM–4.

In  this  context,  NASA  requested  that  The  Aerospace  Corporation  prepare  a  non-
advocate assessment of HST servicing alternatives. These alternatives encompass a
broad  range  of  options  including  doing  nothing  at  all,  minimal  replacement  of  com-
ponents  close  to  failure,  partial  and  full  replacement  of  old  instruments,  rehosting
the  existing  SM–4  replacement  instruments  or  equivalent  on  other  spacecraft,  and
providing a safe habitat in the vicinity of HST so that an astronaut-performed mis-
sion might be reconsidered. Each alternative was assessed against a set of measures
of  effectiveness  (MOEs),  which  included  cost  and  schedule,  risk,  and  the  resulting
capability of HST to perform science relative to the planned post-SM–4 baseline ca-
pability. The capability impact assessment did not address science quality or value,
nor  did  it  address  how  that  science  might  be  impacted  by  constraints  imposed  by
various alternatives. It was assumed that the science value of each instrument has
already been assessed as part of the instrument selection process. The capability im-
pact  assessment  findings  were  made  available  to  the  Office  of  Space  Science  Effec-
tiveness Team (OSSET) for comments on the impact on science value from each al-
ternative.

The study team began with research into HST design and servicing history. Next,
the team considered a broad array of alternative servicing approaches that spanned
the spectrum of options covered by the study. Finally, the team grouped and consoli-
dated similar alternatives into a final set of 21 alternatives that were representative
of the trade space to be examined. The 21 alternatives provided natural incremental
changes in the complexity of servicing operations and in capability enhancement. A
number  of  robotic  alternatives  that  bounded  the  trade  space  were  included  in  the
set, including a minimum mass alternative to de-orbit HST, and an alternative that
provided  power  and  gyro  augmentation  with  and  without  a  robotic  arm  used  for  a
grapple-assisted docking. More complex alternatives, such as one that accomplished
the  goals  of  the  GSFC  HRSDM,  and  an  ambitious  mission  to  accomplish  all  of  the
tasks from SM–4, were also included. Each alternative included a component to de-
orbit  HST  at  the  end  of  its  useful  life.  The  alternatives  were  described  with  suffi-
cient detail to allow evaluation and comparison with other alternatives.

2 In addition to COS and WFC3, SM–4 was to replace the gyros, batteries, fine guidance sen-
sors  (FGS),  and  install  the  aft  shroud  cooling  system  (ASCS)  and  thermal  protection  material.

In parallel with the development of alternatives, MOEs were defined, in terms of
cost  and  schedule,  risk,  and  capability  impact.  Cost  and  schedule  MOEs  examined
absolute cost and development time, as well as cost risk and schedule risk. The risk
MOEs included development risk and also the probability of mission success, assum-
ing the alternatives could be successfully developed. The capability impact MOE was
defined  as  the  estimated  HST  instrument  capability  associated  with  each  of  the  al-
ternatives.

A  measure  for  safety  was  also  defined  early  in  the  study  as  the  mission  risk
weighted  re-entry  casualty  expectation.  This  measure,  however,  turned  out  not  to
be  a  strong  discriminator  among  alternatives,  and  is  therefore  not  included  in  this
report. For cases where the disposal mission is successful, the re-entry casualty ex-
pectation is zero. Without the disposal mission, the casualty expectation is approxi-
mately one in 250.
Description of Alternatives

The HST study trade space examined is illustrated in Figure 1. Alternatives were
defined  in  four  broad  categories:  rehost,  disposal,  service,  and  safe  habitat.  Rehost
alternatives  flew  the  COS  and/or  WFC3  instruments  on  new  platforms.  Disposal
and  service  alternatives  were  accomplished  by  robotic  means.  Safe  habitat  referred
to  a  Shuttle-based  astronaut-servicing  mission  in  concert  with  an  astronaut  safe
habitat  in  the  vicinity  of  HST.  Because  of  recently  imposed  constraints  on  crewed
servicing since the Columbia accident, emphasis was placed on robotic servicing and
de-orbit concepts.

In  defining  specific  alternatives,  the  study  team  sought  a  reasonable  coverage  of
the trade space such as lowest-cost alternatives, alternatives that left the minimum
residual  mass  attached  to  HST,  minimal  complexity  alternatives,  and  high  com-
plexity  alternatives  in  terms  of  number  and  type  of  operations  required.  The  in-
depth  feasibility  assessment  of  the  alternatives  was  not  performed  as  part  of  this
study.  However,  a  screening  of  the  alternatives  was  performed  to  rule-out  unreal-
istic  alternatives.  Key  trades  that  manifest  themselves  in  the  MOEs  are  whether
a  robotic  arm  is  used  to  assist  in  docking  a  de-orbit  or  servicing  module  and  the
number and type of servicing operations performed.

The  decision  tree  analysis  in  Figure  1  led  to  the  following  arrangement  of  alter-
natives  (note  that  all  but  the  ‘‘do  nothing’’  alternative  include  a  de-orbit  mission):

Alternative family A: Extension of HST through non-servicing means.

A1: Maintain HST through ground-based life-extension workarounds, until end

of life.

32

A2: Rehost  replacement  instruments  on  a  new  platform  in  low-Earth  orbit

(LEO), and de-orbit HST.

A3: Rehost  replacement  instruments  or  develop  equivalent  capability  on  a  new

platform beyond LEO, and de-orbit HST.

Alternative family B: Robotic missions.

B1: Robotic docking and disposal of HST without servicing.
B2: Robotic docking and minimal servicing of life extension only, by addition of
an  external  power  and  gyro  system,  followed  at  end  of  life  by  a  separate
de-orbit mission.

B3: Life  extension  and  instrument  replacement  servicing  alternatives,  of  vary-

ing complexity, combined with a de-orbit mission.

B4: Life  extension  and  instrument  replacement  servicing  alternatives,  of  vary-

ing complexity, followed at end of life by a separate de-orbit mission.

Alternative family C: Astronaut safe habitat missions.

C1: Relocate HST to the vicinity of the ISS to provide a safe habitat for a Shut-

tle-based astronaut-servicing mission.

C2: Launch  a  habitat  module  to  the  HST  orbit,  to  provide  a  safe  habitat  for  a

Shuttle-based astronaut-servicing mission.

Alternative family D: Original Shuttle Servicing Mission 4.

D1: Proceed with originally planned SM–4.

Table  1  provides  a  summary  of  each  of  the  21  alternatives.  SM–4  was  not  ana-
lyzed as part of this study; however, it was included in the findings for comparison.
Data for the cost and schedule estimates for SM–4 were provided directly by NASA,
and are unofficial, predecisional estimates.

Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs)

Each  alternative  was  assessed  against  a  common  of  set  of  measures  of  effective-
ness (MOEs), which included cost and schedule, risk, and the observatory capability
relative to the post-SM–4 state.

The cost MOE (MOE #1) was defined to be the life cycle cost (LCC). The LCC in-
cludes (as applicable to the given alternative) servicing and de-orbit module develop-
ment, payload instrument development or modification, spacecraft bus, launch, pro-
gram management, systems engineering, mission assurance, robotics, ground system
development,  servicing  operations,  three  years  of  post-servicing  HST  mission  oper-
ations,  data  analysis,  and  reserves.  Cost  estimates  were  calculated  as  probability
density functions, based on triangular distributions for the main cost elements listed
above. The cost MOE was defined as the 75th percentile life cycle cost.

The  schedule  MOE  (MOE  #2)  was  defined  to  be  the  development  time  from  pro-
gram authority to proceed (ATP) to launch. The schedule MOE was based on sched-
ule estimating relationships developed for the rehost, de-orbit and robotic servicing,
and  safe  haven  option  families.  Like  cost,  schedule  estimates  were  also  developed
as probability distributions for use in the calculation of MOE #3.

Development  risk  (MOE  #3)  was  the  convolution  of  two  probability  distribution
functions:  the  probability  distribution  of  HST  being  in  the  required  state,  and  the
probability  distribution  of  the  development  time.  This  convolution  resulted  in  the
probability  of  HST  being  in  the  required  state  when  the  servicing  or  disposal  mis-
sion is launched. For servicing missions, the ‘‘required state’’ was defined as a state
where  a  servicing  mission  can  dock  with  HST,  either  cooperatively  or
uncooperatively,  and  where  HST  can  be  restored  to  full  operations  using  only  the
replacement  parts  associated  with  the  current  design  of  the  servicing  alternative.
For this study, this is essentially a state where gyros may have failed, but all other
subsystems  necessary  for  the  functioning  of  HST  are  operating.  For  the  disposal-
only  missions,  the  ‘‘required  state’’  was  based  on  HST  having  not  re-entered  the
Earth’s atmosphere.

The  probability  of  mission  success  (MOE  #4)  is  a  measure  of  mission  risk,  and
is  based  on  the  probability  of  successfully  completing  a  sequence  of  events,  begin-
ning  at  launch  and  including  proximity  operations  and  docking,  the  sequence  of
servicing  steps,  three  years  of  HST  mission  operations,  and  de-orbit.  This  measure
is  independent  of  development  risk.  In  the  analysis  process,  there  is  no  linkage  be-
tween  systematic  or  workmanship  errors  that  may  occur  prelaunch  during  develop-
ment, but that manifest themselves later during the mission.

The  capability  MOE  (MOE  #5)  measures  the  predicted  capability  of  the  HST  to
perform  science  relative  to  its  expected  post-SM–4  condition.  There  is  no  metric  for
future space exploration value and no weight is given to the value of one particular
scientific investigation relative to another.
Summary of Results

Figure  2  shows  MOE  #1  (life  cycle  cost)  for  the  alternatives  examined.  The  num-
bers  following  the  bars  provide  the  range  of  costs  within  each  alternative  family.
In all cases, it is assumed that each system is a new development. However, for con-
sistency, each alternative is credited with heritage for about 40 percent of the com-
ponent mass of the system. Not unexpectedly, the astronaut-servicing missions that
depend  on  a  safe  habitat  (alternative  family  C)  are  the  costliest;  while  the  disposal
alternatives  (alternative  family  B1)  are  the  least  expensive.  Note  also  that  there  is
little difference between the cost of the rehost alternatives and the robotic servicing
missions.  The  discriminator  becomes  risk,  which  will  be  discussed  in  the  sections
that follow.

The  rehost  alternatives  range  in  cost  from  $1.9B  to  $2.3B,  with  roughly  $350M
of  that  total  reserved  for  the  HST  de-orbit  mission  (represented  by  B1–A).  The  dis-
posal missions have the greatest variability in cost, ranging from $300M for the sim-
plest  de-orbit  alternative,  B1–D,  to  $1.1B  for  the  B1–B  alternative  that  uses  grap-
ple-arm-assisted  docking.  Drivers  on  the  range  of  B1  family  costs  are  whether  a
robotic arm is utilized, estimated at approximately $300M, with the associated mass
needed to support the robotic components on the de-orbit module. Additionally, inte-
gration  of  the  arm  significantly  increases  program  management,  systems  engineer-
ing, and mission assurance (PM/SE/MA) costs over the no-arm option.

For  the  servicing  alternatives,  costs  range  from  $1.3B  for  the  external  gyro  and
battery augmentation option, which doesn’t require a robotic arm (B2), to $2.2B for
alternative  B4–B,  which  uses  a  second  separate  mission  for  de-orbit.  The  cost  vari-
ations  across  the  B3  family  are  relatively  small  since  the  mass  of  these  options  is
generally insensitive to the equipment manifested and the servicing steps that need
to be accomplished.

The discriminator in the costs for the de-orbit and robotic servicing options is the
grapple arm. Once the grapple arm is included, adding the capability for a dexterous
arm enables a large array of complex servicing tasks at an incremental cost of about
$700M  over  the  armless  external  servicing  option,  B2.  The  cost  of  the  robotics  was
based  on  the  development  cost  of  the  Canadarm-Shuttle  Remote  Manipulator  Sys-
tem  (SRMS),  the  European  Robotic  Arm  (ERA)  for  the  Columbus  Orbital  Facility
of  the  ISS,  and  the  Special  Purpose  Dexterous  Manipulator  (SPDM)  developed  for
use on the ISS.

For  systems  that  do  not  use  the  grapple  arm  to  dock,  there  are  impacts  to  the
design and implementation of the docking system, the requirement for precision ma-
neuvers,  reduced  closing  velocities,  and  small  docking  forces.  In  the  case  of  a  serv-
icing  mission,  the  closing  rates  and  latching  forces  would  be  limited  so  as  not  to
damage  HST.  However,  in  the  case  of  unassisted  docking  for  the  purposes  of  de-
orbit, damage to HST may not be a central issue, and a different approach that al-
lows  higher  forces  to  guarantee  a  hard  dock  and  positive  latching  might  be  more
appropriate.

Figure 3 displays MOE #2, development schedule, and MOE #3, development risk.
The  HST  predicted  lifetime  bar  at  the  bottom  of  Figure  3  is  based  on  two  assump-
tions  on  the  application  of  the  HST  reliability  model.  The  ‘‘HST  Reliability  Model’’
end  of  serviceable  state  (EOSS)  prediction  (50th  percentile  probability  of  failure
date)  is  calculated  using  the  current  failure  rate  assumptions  in  the  reliability
model.  This  model  has  been  improved  over  the  years  by  periodically  updating  the
component failure rates based on actual HST operational data. It has been observed,
however,  that  HST  hardware  has  often  lasted  longer  than  predicted  even  with  the
periodic  updates  to  the  failure  rate  data.  Moreover,  the  reliability  model  was  origi-
nally designed and used to size the interval between servicing missions, and the va-
lidity of using the model to predict an end-of-life state has never been fully assessed.
Consequently,  experts  familiar  with  HST  often  view  the  HST  reliability  model  as
overly conservative. To address this criticism, a different approach, recommended by
NASA GSFC, to updating the failure rates was applied. In this approach, the failure
rates for the top five reliability drivers were recomputed based solely on HST oper-
ational  experience,  having  the  effect  of  significantly  deweighting  them  in  the  reli-

ability  calculation  relative  to  the  standard  HST  reliability  model.  This  approach
adds  about  12  months  of  life  to  HST  (50th  percentile)  and  is  labeled  ‘‘EOSS  GSFC
Assumptions.’’

As can be seen in Figure 3, the nominal development time exceeds the date asso-
ciated  with  the  end  of  serviceable  state  by  a  number  of  months  in  most  cases.  The
B2  servicing  option  nominal  development  time  almost  meets  this  date.  The  prob-
ability  of  HST  being  in  a  serviceable  state  is  less  than  or  equal  to  40  percent  for
the  robotic  servicing  options,  because  they  are  tied  to  a  HST  demise  in  April  2009.
The  de-orbit  alternatives  are  tied  to  the  earliest  re-entry  date  of  2014,  and  can  be
developed within this time with a very high likelihood.

The rehost options are also insensitive to the HST date of demise. However, there
is a high likelihood that the rehost options cannot be developed before the HST end
of  life,  resulting  in  a  multi-year  science  gap  with  no  HST-like  observing  capability
in orbit.

The  development  risk  for  the  SM–4  alternative  is  listed  at  74  percent.  This  cal-
culation is based on the earliest launch date provided by NASA, which is unofficial
and predecisional. In assigning the SM–4 launch date, NASA assumed that the SM–
4 mission, if it were to fly, would be launched 31 months from the ATP date of Octo-
ber  2004.  Conceivably,  the  mission  could  be  moved  forward  in  the  return-to-flight
schedule, which would decrease the development risk, with the constraint that suffi-
cient astronaut training time be provided.

Figure  4  presents  the  probability  of  mission  success  (MOE  #4),  and  provides  an
example  calculation  of  this  value  for  the  baseline  alternative,  B3–B.  The  definition
of mission success is different for each alternative and is dependent on the number
of  events  that  must  be  accomplished  to  achieve  the  final  success  state.  For  all
robotic servicing alternatives, the success state includes three years of science oper-
ations  and  a  successful  de-orbit.  Clearly,  there  are  more  events  that  could  lead  to
mission  failure  for  servicing  missions  than  for  disposal  missions.  Hence,  they  tend
to  have  a  lower  probability  of  mission  success  by  their  very  nature.  As  can  be  seen
in  the  B3–B  example  shown  in  Figure  4,  the  probability  of  mission  success  for  the
robotic servicing missions is dominated by the probability of successfully completing
the  servicing  operations  and  by  the  probability  of  HST  operating  for  three  years,
once  the  servicing  is  complete.  Due  to  the  age  of  the  HST,  after  several  years  of
post-service  operations,  other  components  and  failure  mechanisms  begin  to  domi-
nate the reliability estimates.

Note  the  63  percent  probability  of  mission  success  for  the  SM–4  alternative.  As-
tronaut  servicing  has  been  successfully  demonstrated  on  four  prior  servicing  mis-
sions. Probability of success for the servicing events is 100 percent. The Shuttle has
failed  once  on  launch  and  once  on  re-entry,  leading  to  a  99  percent  probability  of
success.  Here  again,  the  probability  driving  the  success  is  achieving  three  years  of
post-servicing operations.

Figure  5  provides  the  capability  impact  for  each  alternative  relative  to  the  post-
SM–4 baseline (MOE #5), based on historical instrument utilization patterns. Clear-
ly  the  disposal  options  have  a  resultant  relative  capability  of  zero.  The  B2  alter-
native, which provides power and rate-sensing augmentation, is also very low since
new instruments are not added. Furthermore, in the existing HST architecture, the
Near  Infrared  Camera  and  Multi-Object  Spectrometer  (NICMOS)  Cooling  System
(NCS) is powered through a separate circuit that is not accessible by alternative B2.
The result is that the NCS would need to remain operating directly off the HST bat-
tery bus, serviced by the HST solar arrays. This may not be possible once the HST
batteries  reach  a  state  where  they  can  no  longer  hold  sufficient  charge  to  support
the  NCS  load.  The  rehost  alternatives  register  at  40-  or  78-percent  of  the  full  post-
SM–4  capability.  This  calculation  is  based  on  historical  utilization  data  that  indi-
cates  that  new  instruments  generally  crowd  out  the  old  instruments  for  observing
time. This measure is imperfect since it does not account for the benefits of observ-
ing the same target simultaneously with two or more instruments, increased observ-
ing efficiency associated with the rehost alternatives outside of LEO, or the fact that
each  instrument  in  a  smaller  instrument  suite  may  receive  higher  overall  utiliza-
tion.

Since  the  capability  metric  is  based  solely  on  instrument  utilization,  all  alter-
natives that result in the same final instrument complement as the post-SM–4 con-
figuration  were  scored  100  percent.  There  are  additional  servicing  items  accom-
plished  by  SM–4,  such  as  the  installation  of  the  ASCS  radiator  on  the  external
shroud  to  provide  additional  instrument  detector  thermal  margin/control  and  im-
prove  HST’s  operational  efficiency.  This  may  provide  a  capability  benefit  through
additional  observing  time;  however,  enhancements  of  this  nature  are  not  captured
in this metric.

Figure  6  summarizes  the  five  major  MOEs  assessed  in  this  study:  cost,  develop-
ment  time,  development  risk,  mission  risk,  and  capability  impact.  Mission  risk  and
development risk are rated with qualitative descriptors. The uncertainty of the risk
assessments for the robotic servicing alternatives is higher than for the de-orbit mis-
sions  and  the  rehost  options.  While  there  are  several  missions  yet  to  be  launched
that have features similar to the robotic servicing alternatives (autonomous docking
using  grapple  arms,  proximity  operations,  etc.),  none  have  flown,  and  they  are  out-
side the historical experience base. For this reason, it is difficult to discriminate be-
tween  the  risks  associated  with  any  of  the  robotic  servicing  alternatives  when  the
development and mission risks (one minus the probability of success) cluster in the
40 to 60 percent range.

A  qualitative,  but  uncalibrated  scale  was  selected  to  bin  the  mission  risk  values
into  the  ‘‘low,’’  ‘‘medium,’’  and  ‘‘high’’  risk  categories.  In  general,  mission  success
probabilities higher than 80 percent were labeled low risk. Success probabilities be-
tween  80  percent  and  40  percent  were  labeled  medium  risk,  and  success  prob-
abilities below 40 percent were labeled high risk. For medium-risk alternatives, the
mission  risk  was  dominated  by  the  probability  of  HST  operating  successfully  for
three  years  after  the  servicing  mission  is  completed.  Hence,  all  astronaut-servicing
options,  including  SM–4,  have  at  least  medium  mission  risk.  The  medium  ranking
on the SM–4 development risk is constrained by the Shuttle launch date assumption
provided  by  NASA.  In  the  high-risk  category,  mission  risk  was  dominated  both  by
the  probability  of  success  of  the  servicing  mission,  and  the  probability  of  success  of
the three years of operations.

Figure  7  illustrates  the  results  of  combining  three  MOEs—capability  (MOE  #5),
development  risk  (MOE  #3),  and  probability  of  mission  success  (MOE  #4)—to
produce an expected value calculation:

Expected Value = MOE #3 * MOE #4 * MOE #5

This  combined  expected  value  is  plotted  against  life-cycle  cost.  Figure  7  indicates
that  the  disposal  alternatives  provide  no  value  relative  to  observatory  capability.
The  expected  value  calculation  also  indicates  that  rehosting  both  the  SM–4  instru-
ments on new platforms provides higher value at equivalent cost to the robotic-serv-
icing  missions.  This  results  from  the  lower  development  and  mission  risks,  which
includes  launch  and  on-orbit  operations,  associated  with  the  rehost  alternatives.
There is, however, a gap in science with the rehost alternatives that is not captured
in this expected value assessment.

The robotic servicing alternatives cluster in the lower right corner of the plot, sug-
gesting that the value of these alternatives is limited based on difficulty of the mis-
sion  implementation,  the  complexity  of  the  servicing  mission,  and  the  reliability  of
HST after servicing.

SM–4 has costs in the same range as the rehost and robotic-servicing alternatives.
It  has  the  added  benefit  of  higher  probability  of  mission  success  than  the  robotic
servicing  missions,  and  does  not  suffer  from  the  gap  in  science  associated  with  the
rehost alternatives.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  LOUIS  J.  LANZEROTTI,  CHAIR,  COM-
MITTEE ON ASSESSMENT OF OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE LIFE
OF  THE  HUBBLE  SPACE  TELESCOPE,  NATIONAL  RESEARCH
COUNCIL,  THE  NATIONAL  ACADEMIES;  ACCOMPANIED  BY
GENERAL  CHARLES  F.  BOLDEN,  JR.  (RET.),  SENIOR  VICE
PRESIDENT  AT  TECHTRANS  INTERNATIONAL,  INC.,  AND  JO-

OF DIRECTORS, UNIVERSAL SPACE NETWORK
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Gordon,  Members  of  the
Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today.  My
name  is  Louis  Lanzerotti,  as  the  Chairman  indicated.  I  appear  in
my capacity as Chair of the National Academies Committee on As-
sessment  of  Options  to  Extend  the  Life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Tele-
scope.

In  early  2004,  the  National  Academies  were  asked  by  Congress
and  NASA  to  examine  the  issues  surrounding  the  cancellation  in
January of that year of the final servicing for the Hubble telescope,
and to consider both the value of preserving Hubble and the poten-
tial methods for doing so.

The  Academies  formed  a  committee  of  members  of  outstanding
international  reputations  and  credentials.  The  committee  con-
cluded,  after  detailed  examination  of  the  evidence,  that  NASA
should commit to a Hubble servicing mission that accomplished the
objectives of the originally planned servicing mission.

42

The  committee’s  three  principal  conclusions  related  to  the  mis-
sion  and  the  crew  risk  of  servicing  Hubble  were  the  following.
First, the need for timely servicing of Hubble due to lifetime limits
on  various  engineering  subsystems  imposes  difficult  requirements
on the development of a robotic servicing mission. The very aggres-
sive schedule, the complexity of the mission system design, the low
current  level—current  low  level  of  technology  maturity,  with  the
notable exception of the Space Station Dexterous Manipulator Sys-
tem, make it highly unlikely that the science life of Hubble will be
extended through robotic servicing.

Secondly,  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  is  the  best  option  for  ex-
tending the life of Hubble, preparing it—and preparing it for even-
tual  robotic  de-orbit.  The  committee  believes  that  this  servicing
mission could reasonably occur as early as the seventh Shuttle mis-
sion following return-to-flight.

Thirdly,  the  committee  also  concluded  that  the  difference  in  the
crew  risk  faced  by  a  single  Shuttle  mission  to  the  Space  Station,
already accepted, I noted, by NASA and the Nation, about 25 to 30
flights,  and  the  crew  risk  of  a  single  Shuttle  mission  to  Hubble  is
very  small.  These  conclusions  were  reached  after  in  depth  analyt-
ical  examination  of  technical  data,  presentations  by  expert  wit-
nesses, extensive consultations with NASA and with industry, mul-
tiple site visits by committee members to the Goddard Space Flight
Center, the Johnson Space Flight Center.

The committee did not rely on any one source, such as the Aero-
space  report,  in  its  deliberations,  although  Aerospace  and  we  ar-
rived  at  similar  conclusions  on  some  of  the  issues.  The  committee
received  inputs  from  many  different  sources,  accepted  no  conclu-
sions  that  it  could  not  independently  verify.  Two  of  my  esteemed
committee members, General Charles Bolden, a veteran former as-
tronaut  whose  Shuttle  missions  include  the  deployment  of  the
Hubble  telescope,  and  Mr.  Joseph  Rothenberg,  former  Associate
Administrator  of  Space  Flight  at  NASA  Headquarters,  and  former
Director  of  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center,  are  present  with  me
today,  and  will  be  available,  and  I  will  call  on  them  for  answers
of some questions.

When this study was initiated, I found a broad diversity of opin-
ion  among  Committee  members  on  both  the  question  of  whether
Hubble should be preserved, agnostic, just as you said yourself are,
Mr.  Chairman,  and  if  so,  if  it  should  be  preserved,  which  method
of  doing  so  is  preferable.  After  a  vigorous  and  questioning  explo-
ration  of  the  information  presented  to  us,  many  committee  meet-
ings,  subcommittee  meetings,  the  Committee  reached  its  conclu-
sions in our report unanimously and without reservation.

And  with  regard  to  Hubble,  I  will  only  very  briefly  note,  many
of you, all three of you on the—who have spoken on the dais, have
indicated this. Results from Hubble have captured the imagination
of  scientists  and  of  the  general  public  around  the  world.  Hubble
has been one of the most important outreach instruments in terms
of  contributions  to  public  awareness  of  science  and  of  the  universe
in  which  we  live.  It  might  be  argued,  of  course,  that  the  universe
will  be  here  into  the  future,  for  other  space  missions  to  explore.
However, I would like to note that a number of NASA space astron-
omy  missions  presently  in  flight,  as  well  as  planned,  including  the

43

X-ray satellite Chandra, and the infrared satellite Spitzer, will not
be  as  productive  as  they  can  be  if  synergistic  data  were  not  avail-
able  from  Hubble  for  the  analyses  and  for  carrying  on.  My  col-
league  Professor  Taylor  here  is  here  today,  and  will  address  this
aspect of—and can address this aspect of Hubble much better than
can I.

Now,  in  comparing  the  various  options.  My  Committee’s  engi-
neering  analyses  concluded  that  Hubble  most  likely  will  need  to
terminate science operations by mid-2007. Therefore, any servicing
mission  must  be  accomplished  by  the  end  of  2007  at  the  latest  to
prevent  an  interruption  in  science,  and  to  not  have  an  impaired
Hubble  to  deal  with.  Even  NASA’s  most  optimistic  projections
places  the  robotic  mission  in  December  2007.  This  estimate  was
made  when  the  NASA  project  hoped  to  receive  full  development
funding  in  both  2005  and  2006,  something  that  has  not  occurred.
And  Mr.  Rothenberg  can  address  that  further,  if  there  are  some
questions related to that.

My committee compared a robotic servicing mission with a Shut-
tle  servicing  one.  Important  strengths  of  a  Shuttle  servicing  mis-
sion  include  it  has  been  done  before,  four  times  in  fact,  success-
fully. There is no new development required. All of the instruments
and replacement equipment have been built, so there is low sched-
ule risk. Numerous life extension upgrades that are not feasible on
a robotics mission could be carried out with a Shuttle mission, and
there  have  been—this  has  been  proven  to  be  the  case  time  and
again on the previous four missions, servicing missions.

A  human  mission  has  the  unique  ability  to  respond  to  last
minute  requirements,  usually  driven  by  unforeseen  failure,  and
again,  we  have  shown  that  in  previous  servicing  missions.  The
risks  and  costs  of  the  eventual  de-orbit  mission  for  Hubble  could
be decreased substantially by pre-positioning a docking mechanism
and associated fiducials. The main risks of a Shuttle servicing mis-
sion  are  that  the  schedule  depends  on  a  successful  Shuttle  return-
to-flight,  and  a  small  crew  risk,  as  I  noted,  by  flying  one  more
Shuttle  mission.  An  additional  Shuttle  mission  would  also  delay
Space Station assembly by three to five months.

The  strengths  of  a  robotic  mission  are  that  it  avoids  risks  to  as-
tronauts  of  one  additional  Shuttle  flight.  It  is  exciting  technology.
Some of the technology may have applications to other space activi-
ties,  although  we  have  to  recognize  that  Hubble  was  not  designed
for  robotic  servicing.  The  weaknesses  of  a  robotic  mission  are  pri-
marily  those  associated  with  successfully  achieving  an  extremely
ambitious  mission  on  a  very  aggressive  schedule,  and  a  very  real
risk to Hubble of using it as an uncooperative target vehicle for the
demonstration of unproven robotic technology.

My  committee—if  I  might  have  one  more  minute  to  address
dehosting—my  committee  had  a  number  of  important  concerns  on
practical  aspects  of  rehosting  of  Hubble  instruments.  For  com-
parable science returns, NASA would need—certainly need to com-
mit  to,  to  fly  and  build,  a  new  Hubble  telescope.  For  mission  suc-
cess,  this  program  would  require  a  commitment  of  very  significant
resources,  as  well  as  very  strong  scientific  and  political  support
over  an  extended  interval.  Such  a  program  has  never  been  evalu-
ated by the priority setting process of a Decadal Survey, which Dr.

Taylor will outline. It was not clear to my committee that rehosting
would  involve  significant  cost  savings  over  a  Shuttle  repair  mis-
sion,  particularly  given  the  uncertainties  of  developing  an  entire
new satellite that performs like the original Hubble. For these rea-
sons,  I  personally  have  strong  reservations  regarding  a  rehosting
option  for  Hubble,  as  compared  to  a  Shuttle  repair  mission.  If  a
Shuttle repair mission were proven not to be possible. For example,
if  return-to-flight  of  the  Shuttle  was  not  successful,  then  I  would
recommend that the tradeoffs involving a rehosting mission should
be reviewed by the astronomy community in the context of its over-
all  planning  for  space  astronomy  in  the  next  decade,  such—in  the
context of the Decadal Survey.

In concluding, I reiterate that my committee found Hubble to be
a scientific asset of extraordinary value to the Nation, that Shuttle
serving  is  best—servicing  is  the  best  option  for  extending  the  life
of  Hubble.  Thank  you,  and  as  I  indicated,  my  colleagues,  General
Bolden  and  Mr.  Rothenberg,  and  I  are  prepared  to  answer  your
questions.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Lanzerotti follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF LOUIS J. LANZEROTTI

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and Members of the Committee:
Thank you for inviting me here to testify today. My name is Louis Lanzerotti and
I am a Professor of Physics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and a consult-
ant  for  Bell  Laboratories,  Lucent  Technologies.  I  appear  today  in  my  capacity  as
Chair  of  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC)’s  Committee  on  Assessment  of  Op-
tions to Extend the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope.

As  you  know  the  NRC  is  the  unit  of  the  National  Academies  that  is  responsible
for  organizing  independent  advisory  studies  for  the  Federal  Government  on  science
and technology. In early 2004 the NRC was asked by Congress and NASA to exam-
ine the issues surrounding the cancellation of the final servicing mission (SM–4) for
the Hubble Space Telescope and to consider both the value of preserving Hubble and
the  potential  methods  for  doing  so.  Specifically  called  out  in  the  tasking  was  a  re-
quirement  to  survey  the  potentials  of  both  on-orbit  and  robotic  intervention.  The
National  Research  Council  formed  a  committee  under  the  auspices  of  the  Space
Studies Board and the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board to respond to this
request.

• The need for timely servicing of Hubble, due to lifetime limits on various en-
gineering  subsystems,  imposes  difficult  requirements  on  the  development  of
a  robotic  servicing  mission.  The  very  aggressive  schedule,  the  complexity  of
the over-all mission system design (which is in a rudimentary state), the cur-
rent  low  level  of  technology  maturity  (other  than  the  yet-to-be  flown  Inter-
national  Space  Station  (ISS)  Special  Purpose  Dexterous  Manipulator  System
(SPDM)  and  Grapple  Arm  (GA;  essentially  the  Shuttle  Remote  Manipulator
System  (RMS)),  and  the  inability  of  a  robotics  mission  to  respond  to  unfore-
seen failures that may well occur on Hubble between now and a robotic serv-
icing  mission  make  it  highly  unlikely  that  the  science  life  of  HST  will  be  ex-
tended through robotic servicing.
• A Shuttle servicing mission is the best option for extending the life of Hubble
and preparing the observatory for eventual robotic de-orbit; such a mission is
highly  likely  to  succeed.  The  committee  believes  that  this  servicing  mission
could occur as early as the seventh Shuttle mission following return-to-flight,

After  detailed  examination  of  the  astronomical  evidence  that  was  presented  to  it,
the  committee  concluded  that  NASA  should  commit  to  a  Hubble  serving  mission
that  accomplishes  the  objectives  of  the  originally  planned  SM–4  mission.  This  in-
cludes  the  emplacement  of  two  new  instruments,  the  Cosmic  Origins  Spectrograph
(COS)  and  the  Wide  Field  Camera-3  (WFC3),  as  well  as  refurbishments  of  those
spacecraft subsystems that are required to preserve the health and safety of the tel-
escope, both for science as well as for eventual safe de-orbiting.

The  committee’s  principle  conclusions  related  to  the  mission  risk  of  servicing

Hubble were:

at which point critical Shuttle missions required for maintaining the ISS will
have been accomplished.

It  is  obvious  that  a  robotic  servicing  mission  to  Hubble  would  involve  no  risk  to
astronauts.  However,  the  committee  was  informed  that  the  Nation  is  committed  to
25  to  30  human  Shuttle  flights  to  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  In  review-
ing all of the data presented to it, and in making use of the expertise of the commit-
tee’s  members  who  have  deep  experience  in  human  space  flight  as  well  as  in  man-
aging the Nation’s human space flight program,

• The  committee  concluded  that  the  difference  between  the  risk  faced  by  the
crew  of  a  single  Shuttle  mission  to  the  ISS—already  accepted  by  NASA  and
the  Nation—and  the  risk  faced  by  the  crew  of  a  Shuttle  mission  to  HST  is
very small. Given the intrinsic value of a serviced Hubble, and the high likeli-
hood  of  success  for  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission,  the  committee  judges  that
such a mission is worth the risk.

As I noted, these conclusions were reached after a considerable, in-depth examina-
tion  of  technical  data  and  documents,  presentations  by  expert  witnesses,  extensive
exchanges  and  consultations  with  NASA,  industry  and  academic  colleagues,  and
multiple  site  visits  to  the  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  and  the  Johnson  Space
Flight  Center.  The  committee  members  have  outstanding,  world-recognized  creden-
tials  in  not  only  the  diverse  fields  relevant  to  this  study  (ranging  from  risk  assess-
ment to astronomy) but also in their decades of direct, practical, experience with the
NASA spacecraft systems and programs that were being evaluated. Two of my com-
mittee members, General Charles Bolden, a veteran former astronaut whose Shuttle
missions  include  the  deployment  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  and  Mr.  Joseph
Rothenberg, former Associate Administrator of Spaceflight at NASA and former Di-
rector of the Goddard Space Flight Center, are present with me today and are avail-
able to answer questions.

Before  I  continue  I  would  like  to  note,  and  indeed  stress,  that  when  this  study
was  initiated,  I  found  a  broad  diversity  of  opinion  among  the  committee  members
on both the question of whether Hubble should be preserved, and if so, which meth-
od of doing so was preferable. After all, from my personal experience and the experi-
ence of some members of the committee, almost no space researcher is ever in favor
of  turning  off  an  operating  spacecraft  that  is  continuing  to  return  excellent  data.
Hence,  some  members  of  the  committee  questioned  at  the  outset  of  our  study  the
very  premise  of  keeping  Hubble  alive.  It  was  only  after  a  vigorous  and  painstaking
exploration  of  the  information  presented  to  us,  and  considerable  questioning  anal-
ysis, that the committee reached the conclusions that are found in our report. Those
conclusions were reached unanimously, and without reservation, by our entire mem-
bership.

Of the many issues considered by the committee, I have been asked to focus today
on 1) Hubble’s contribution to science and what its loss or performance interruption
would  mean,  and  the  2)  the  comparative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  a  Shuttle
servicing mission, a robotic servicing mission, and a rehosting mission. I will there-
fore devote the remainder of my testimony to these issues.
The Past and Future Contributions of Hubble

Over its lifetime, the HST has been an enormous scientific success, having earned
extraordinary scientific and public recognition for its contributions to all areas of as-
tronomy.  Hubble  is  the  most  powerful  space  astronomical  facility  ever  built,  and  it
provides wavelength coverage and capabilities that are unmatched by any other op-
tical  telescope  currently  operating  or  planned.  Much  of  Hubble’s  extraordinary  im-
pact was foreseen when the telescope was being planned. It was predicted, for exam-
ple, that the space telescope would reveal massive black holes at the centers of near-
by  galaxies,  measure  the  size  and  age  of  the  observable  universe,  probe  far  enough
back in time to capture galaxies soon after their formation, and provide crucial keys
to the evolution of chemical elements within stars.

All  of  these  predicted  advances  have  been  realized,  but  the  list  of  unforeseen
Hubble  accomplishments  may  prove  even  greater.  Hubble  did  discover  ‘‘adolescent’’
galaxies,  but  it  also  saw  much  farther  back  in  time  to  capture  galaxies  on  the  very
threshold  of  formation.  Einstein’s  theory  of  general  relativity  was  bolstered  by  the
detection  and  measurement  of  myriad  gravitational  lenses,  each  one  probing  the
mysterious dark matter that pervades galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Gamma-ray
bursts had puzzled astronomers for more than 20 years; in concert with ground and
X-ray  telescopes,  Hubble  placed  them  near  the  edge  of  the  visible  universe  and  es-
tablished  them  as  the  universe’s  brightest  beacons,  outshining  whole  galaxies  for
brief  moments.  Perhaps  most  spectacularly,  Hubble  confirmed  and  strengthened
preliminary evidence from other telescopes for the existence of ‘‘dark energy,’’ a new

46

constituent  of  the  universe  that  generates  a  repulsive  gravity  whose  effect  is  to
drive galaxies apart faster over time. The resulting acceleration of universal expan-
sion is a new development in physics, possibly as important as the landmark discov-
eries  of  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity  near  the  beginning  of  the  20th
century.

Closer  to  home,  Hubble  has  zeroed  in  on  our  own  cosmic  past  by  uncovering  vir-
tual  carbon  copies  of  how  the  Sun  and  solar  system  formed.  Dozens  of
protoplanetary disks have been found encircling young stars in nearby star-forming
regions  of  the  Milky  Way.  The  sizes  and  densities  of  these  disks  show  how  surplus
dust  and  gas  collect  near  infant  stars  to  form  the  raw  material  of  planets.  Dozens
of  large,  Jupiter-like  planets  have  been  discovered,  initially  by  other  telescopes  but
recently by Hubble using a new and more precise method. Measuring the tiny drop
in light as a planet transits the disk of its parent star, the new technique could lead
to  a  method  for  discovering  Earth-like  planets—a  discovery  with  tremendous  long-
term implications for the human race.

I would like to stress that results from Hubble—its pictures and the new concepts
that  have  flowed  from  these  images—have  captured  the  imagination  of  the  general
public,  not  only  in  our  country  but  around  the  world.  Hubble  has  been  one  of  the
most  important  outreach  instruments  in  terms  of  its  contributions  to  public  aware-
ness of science and of the universe in which we live.

Fascinating as they are, the scientific returns (and the public interest and excite-
ment) from Hubble are far from their natural end. With its present instruments the
telescope  could  continue  probing  star  formation  and  evolution,  gathering  more  data
on  other  planetary  systems,  revealing  phenomena  of  the  planets  and  comets  in  our
own  solar  system,  and  exploring  the  nature  of  the  universe  at  much  earlier  times.
Two new instruments, already built for NASA’s previously planned servicing mis-
sion (SM–4), would amplify the telescope’s capabilities by allowing qualitatively new
observations  in  two  under-exploited  spectral  regions.  Such  rejuvenation  via  new  in-
struments  has  occurred  after  every  Hubble  servicing  mission,  and  the  next  one
promises  to  be  no  different.  Wide  Field  Camera-3  (WFC3)  would  increase  Hubble’s
discovery  efficiency  for  ultraviolet  and  near-infrared  imaging  by  factors  of  10  to  30.
The  UV  channel  coupled  with  the  camera’s  wide  field  of  view  will  image  the  final
assembly  of  galaxies  still  taking  place  in  the  universe.  The  near-infrared  channel
of  WFC3  favors  discovery  of  the  very  youngest  galaxies,  whose  light  is  maximally
red-shifted.  The  available  UV,  visible,  and  near-IR  channels  will  combine  to  give  a
sweeping,  panchromatic  view  of  objects  as  diverse  as  star  clusters,  interstellar  gas
clouds, galaxies, and planets in our own solar system.

The second new instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), will increase
Hubble’s  observing  speed  for  typical  medium-resolution  ultraviolet  spectroscopy  by
at  least  a  factor  of  10  to  30,  and  in  some  cases  by  nearly  two  orders  of  magnitude.
Ultraviolet spectra carry vital clues to the nature of both the oldest and the young-
est  stars,  yet  UV  rays  are  totally  invisible  to  ground-based  telescopes.  COS  will  fill
important  gaps  in  our  understanding  of  the  birth  and  death  of  stars  in  nearby  gal-
axies.  Even  more  impressive,  COS  will  use  the  light  of  distant  quasars  to  spotlight
previously  undetectable  clouds  of  dispersed  gas  between  nearby  galaxies,  thereby
mapping in unprecedented detail the properties of the so-called ‘‘cosmic web.’’

The  future  accomplishments  I  have  described,  and  the  many  unforeseen  discov-
eries  that  are  impossible  to  predict  but  certain  to  occur,  are  what  would  be  lost  if
Hubble  was  not  serviced  or  replaced.  It  might  be  argued,  of  course,  that  the  uni-
verse  will  be  here  into  the  future  for  other  space  missions  to  explore  further.  How-
ever,  a  number  of  NASA  space  astronomy  missions  presently  in  flight  as  well  as
planned,  including  the  X-ray  satellite  Chandra  and  the  infra-red  satellite  Spitzer,
would not be as productive as they can be if synergistic data from Hubble were not
to  be  available  for  analyses.  The  most  recent  Decadal  Survey  of  Astronomy  has
predicated  its  recommendations  for  the  future  of  the  research  field,  and  for  the  fu-
ture facilities that would be needed for future advances, on the existence of Hubble
data and its use in conjunction with other NASA space astronomy missions. My col-
league  Professor  Joseph  Taylor,  a  Co-Chair  of  this  Decadal  Survey,  is  here  today
and can address this aspect of Hubble much better than can I.

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  a  central  issue  in  the  discussions  that  entered
into  our  committee’s  conclusions  is  that  the  Hubble  has  a  limited  life;  it  was  de-
signed  from  the  outset  to  be  serviced  periodically.  A  lengthy  delay  in  servicing  (the
technical  details  are  described  in  detail  in  our  report)  could  result  in  a  permanent
loss of the telescope and even in a telescope orientation that would prevent ultimate
safe de-orbit.

As shown in our report, it is most likely that an interruption of science operations
will  occur  due  to  gyroscope  failure  some  time  in  mid-2007  unless  servicing  occurs.
The  ultimate,  irreversible,  failure  of  the  telescope  in  the  next  several  years  is  de-

pendent on battery lifetime. Our committee spent a great deal of time investigating
the conditions of the batteries (with a sub group of the committee speaking to NASA
and  other  engineers,  including  the  battery  manufacturer,  and  studying  data  from
battery life tests in a laboratory) and concluded that the window for battery failure
that would end science operations opens in about May 2007. The window for poten-
tial  vehicle  failure  opens  in  2009.  While  there  are  many  considerations  in  coming
to  these  dates,  there  are  few  options  beyond  servicing  for  improving  the  outcome.
The  batteries  themselves  are  not  greatly  affected  by  lighter  loading  that  might  be
possible  by  early  termination  of  science  operations  since  operations  will  already  be
terminated at an early date due to loss of gyros.
Comparison of Robotic Servicing, Shuttle Servicing and Rehosting

Let  us  leave  aside  for  the  moment  the  issue  of  placing  the  Hubble  instruments
on  some  other  spacecraft  and  begin  with  the  realization  that,  given  the  predicted
failure  of  the  on-board  gyros,  HST  most  likely  will  need  to  terminate  science  oper-
ations  by  mid-2007.  Based  on  this  engineering  determination  which  we  believe  to
be  correct,  any  servicing  mission,  Shuttle  or  robotic,  must  be  accomplished  by  the
end  of  2007  at  the  latest  to  prevent  an  interruption  in  science.  A  delay  past  2007
not  only  results  in  increasing  odds  that  the  repair  mission  will  meet  an  impaired
Hubble  when  it  launches.  In  the  case  of  a  robotic  mission,  it  also  means  a  growing
reduction in the remaining lifespan of the serviced Hubble because, unlike a human
servicing  mission,  it  will  be  incapable  of  correcting  most  types  of  avionics  system
failures. A 2009 robotic mission would occur at a time when the telescope is already
at the fifty percent risk point.

Even  NASA’s  most  optimistic  projections  places  the  robotic  mission  in  December
2007,  and  this  estimate  was  made  when  the  NASA  project  hoped  to  receive  full
funding  for  development  in  both  2005  and  2006,  something  that  has  not  occurred.
Because the impact of reduced funding is always schedule delay, and often increased
risk,  there  is  a  low  probability  of  being  able  to  undertake  a  successful  robotic  mis-
sion in time to save HST, even if much of the hardware has already been assembled
and all of the systems testing had been successfully accomplished.

Now,  let  us  compare  a  robotic  servicing  mission  with  a  Shuttle  servicing  one.
Some  of  the  important  strengths  of  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  are  (1)  it  has  been
done  successfully  before—four  times  in  fact—so  there  is  no  new  development  re-
quired; (2) all of the instruments and replacement equipment have been built or can
be  made  ready,  so  there  is  low  schedule  risk;  (3)  numerous  life  extension  upgrades
that  are  not  feasible  on  a  robotics  mission  could  be  carried  out;  (4)  the  Shuttle  has
a  proven  capability  for  repairing  Hubble  with  one  hundred  percent  success  history
from  four  missions;  and  (5)  a  human  mission  has  the  unique  ability  to  respond  to
last-minute requirements, usually driven by unforeseen failure (such as the need for
new  magnetometer  covers  that  occurred  on  SM–1).  In  addition,  and  very  impor-
tantly,  the  SM–4  mission  could  reduce  the  risk  and  cost  of  the  eventual  de-orbit
mission for Hubble by pre-positioning a docking mechanism and associated fiducials
on  the  aft  end  of  the  telescope  so  that  the  rendezvous  and  docking  of  the  de-orbit
module would be greatly facilitated over the uncooperative target that the telescope
presently offers to any robot approaching it. The main weaknesses in a Shuttle serv-
icing  mission  are  that  the  schedule  depends  on  successful  Shuttle  Return-To-Flight
(RTF),  and  there  is  a  small  crew  safety  risk  by  flying  one  Shuttle  mission  in  addi-
tion  to  the  25  to  30  that  are  estimated  by  NASA  as  required  for  completion  of  the
ISS. The additional Shuttle mission would also delay ISS assembly by three to five
months,  thereby  increasing  slightly  Shuttle  program  costs  (in  comparison  to  total
Shuttle  program  costs)  at  the  end  of  the  Shuttle  life,  currently  projected  for  2010.
The  strengths  of  a  robotic  mission  are  (1)  it  avoids  the  risks  to  astronauts  of  one
additional Shuttle flight; (2) it is exciting technology; and (3) some of the technology
may have applications to other space activities. The weaknesses are primarily those
associated with successfully achieving an extremely ambitious mission on an aggres-
sive  schedule,  and  the  risk  to  HST  (not  only  to  HST  science  but  also  to  eventual
successful de-orbit) of using it as a target vehicle for the demonstration of unproven
technology.  It  also  has  very  large  costs,  both  near-  and  far-term  costs;  an  estimate
of  $2.2  billion  (or  more  including  launch  costs)  was  provided  to  NASA  by  the  Aero-
space  Corporation.  Those  members  of  the  committee  who  are  familiar  with  such
costs believe that this number is plausible.

From  the  risk  mitigation  viewpoint,  the  committee  stated  in  our  report  that  the
planned  use  for  the  robotic  servicing  mission  of  the  mature  ISS  robotic  arm  and
robotic  operational  ground  system  helps  reduce  both  the  schedule  risk  and  the  de-
velopment  risk  for  this  mission.  However,  the  committee  found  many  other  serious
challenges  to  the  development  of  a  successful  robotic  mission.  Some  of  these  chal-
lenges  are  due  to  the  simple  fact  that  Hubble  was  not  designed  to  be  serviced

robotically, and thus has hardware features that are designed for human, not robot,
interactions. Challenging issues for a successful robotic mission include:

• Technologies  required  for  close  proximity  operations  and  autonomous  ren-
dezvous  and  capture  of  the  telescope  have  not  been  demonstrated  in  a  space
environment.
• The control algorithms and software for several proposed systems such as the
laser  ranging  instrument  (lidar)  and  the  camera-based  control  of  the  grapple
arm are mission-critical technologies that have not been flight-tested.
• Technologies  needed  for  autonomous  manipulation,  disassembly  and  assem-
bly,  and  for  control  of  manipulators  based  on  vision  and  force  feedback  have
not been demonstrated in space.
• The Goddard HST project has a long history of Hubble Shuttle servicing expe-
rience,  but  little  experience  with  autonomous  rendezvous  and  docking  or
robotic  technology  development,  or  with  the  operations  required  for  the  pro-
posed HST robotic servicing mission.
• The Committee found that the Goddard HST project had made advances since
January  2004.  However,  the  Committee  also  found  that  there  remain  signifi-
cant  technology  challenges  and—very  significantly—major  systems  engineer-
ing  and  development  challenges  to  successfully  extend  the  lifetime  of  HST
through robotic servicing.
• The  proposed  Hubble  robotic  servicing  mission  involves  a  level  of  complexity
that  is  inconsistent  with  the  current  39-month  development  schedule  and
would  require  an  unprecedented  improvement  in  development  performance
compared  with  that  of  space  missions  of  similar  complexity.  The  committee
concluded  that  the  likelihood  of  successful  development  of  the  HST  robotic
servicing mission within the baseline 39-month schedule is remote.

Rehosting

Rehosting of the two new instruments COS and WFC3 was the final option I was
asked to discuss in my testimony today. In theory, the flight of these existing instru-
ments  on  a  new  astronomy  mission  would  be  a  possible  means  of  obtaining  some
of  the  science  that  would  otherwise  be  lost  if  Hubble  were  not  repaired  through  a
Shuttle servicing mission. The information that was provided by NASA to the com-
mittee  on  possible  rehosting  options  was  very  sketchy,  certainly  not  as  defined  and
as detailed as was much of the technical information available for servicing Hubble.
One  clear  advantage  of  any  rehost  mission  is  that  it  would  use  a  spacecraft  that
employed  current  era  technologies.  Possible  rehosting  missions  could  be  to  either  a
low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as the one that Hubble is currently flying in, or to some
other  orbit,  such  as  geosynchronous  or  a  Lagrangian  point.  It  was  unclear  to  the
committee  which,  if  any,  of  these  orbits  was  under  any  serious  consideration  by
NASA.  Thus,  I  have  to  speculate  somewhat  as  to  what  might  be  being  proposed
today, some four months after the committee’s last meeting.

A  rehost  mission  to  geosynchronous  orbit  or  to  a  Lagrangian  point  would  require
the  employment  of  launch  vehicles  that  would  permit  the  mission  to  arrive  at,  and
to  survive  there.  A  spacecraft  to  a  Lagrangian  point  location  would  likely  involve
a  thermal  design  that  was  simpler  than  is  used  on  Hubble  since  no  eclipses  would
occur in that orbit. At geosynchronous orbit, eclipses occur twice a year, such as geo-
synchronous communications spacecraft experience. The relative absence of eclipses
at  geosynchronous  or  at  a  Lagrangian  point  would  also  allow  a  higher  duty  cycle
for  the  acquisition  of  science  data.  Any  new  telescope  located  at  either  location
would  not  be  practical  to  service,  a  feature  that  has  allowed  the  HST  to  be  contin-
ually upgraded since launch.

Independent of the lack of solid technical (to say nothing of lack of schedule) infor-
mation  on  rehost  options,  the  committee  had  a  number  of  important  concerns  with
respect to the practical aspects of rehosting. In order to obtain science returns from
the COS and the WFC3 comparable to the return from the instruments if they were
flown on Hubble, the new satellite would have to carry a 2.4 meter diameter mirror,
with diffraction-limited performance down to the ultraviolet (such a mirror diameter
is  especially  necessary  for  the  science  of  the  WFC3  instrument),  together  with  a
very accurate pointing and guiding system that would be consistent with HST’s ca-
pabilities.  The  two  instruments  would  also  have  to  be  modified  from  their  present
states in order to be able to effectively use the new un-aberrated mirror that would
likely  be  designed  and  built  for  the  new  spacecraft.  (It  seems  inconceivable  to  me
that an aberrated mirror would be purposefully designed for a brand new spacecraft
just  to  match  the  Hubble’s  aberrated  mirror.)  In  essence  then,  NASA  would  need
to commit to, and to build and fly, a new Hubble telescope with an unaberrated mir-

ror.  The  original  Hubble  development  and  testing  program  involved  a  lengthy  and
costly process. For mission success, this new rehost development program would re-
quire  a  commitment  of  very  significant  resources  as  well  as  political  support  over
an interval of several years. The committee questioned whether such a commitment
is  likely  to  be  given,  let  alone  sustained  in  the  face  of  numerous  competing,  high-
priority, peer-reviewed astronomy programs that are already planned.

Even  if  the  new  Hubble  program  were  adequately  supported,  such  a  program
would  come  with  the  added  risks  that  technical  problems  could  halt  or  seriously
delay  development.  In  addition,  as  already  noted  in  the  Aerospace  Corporation  re-
port,  it  was  not  clear  to  the  committee  that  there  would  be  significant  cost  savings
over the options for a Shuttle SM–4 repair mission, particularly given the uncertain-
ties  of  developing  an  entirely  new  satellite  that  performs  like  the  original  Hubble.
Finally,  unlike  a  Hubble  repair,  a  satellite  with  rehosted  instruments  would  rep-
resent  a  significant  new  astronomy  program  that  never  was  carefully  evaluated  for
cost and schedule in the deliberative, detailed planning process that was carried out
for astronomy research in the most recent Decadal Survey—a process that involved
a great many resource and schedule trade-offs.

The SM–4 Hubble service mission has been in NASA plans and budgeting profiles
for  years.  In  contrast,  it  would  appear  that  any  consideration  of  any  rehosting  op-
tion  would  need  to  obtain  and  to  critically  evaluate  accurate  data  on  the  costs  for
a satellite development mission of a complexity almost identical to that for the origi-
nal Hubble. In addition, the review of a rehosting mission by the astronomy commu-
nity would have to establish its relative priority for funding and scheduling in terms
of planned and on-going programs.

For  these  reasons,  I  personally  would  have  strong  reservations  regarding  a  plan
to rehost the COS and the WFC3 Hubble instruments on another satellite, particu-
larly  when  compared  to  a  Shuttle  repair  mission.  If  a  Shuttle  repair  mission  were
not  possible—if  for  instance  NASA  was  not  successful  in  returning  Shuttle  to
flight—then  I  would  argue  that  the  trade-offs  of  performing  a  rehosting  mission
should  be  reviewed  by  the  astronomy  community  in  the  context  of  its  overall  plan-
ning for space astronomy in the next decade.

In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  reiterate  the  committee’s  conclusions  that  Hubble
is a scientific asset of extraordinary value to the Nation, and that Shuttle servicing
is the best option for extending the life of Hubble.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  I  am  prepared  to  an-

swer any questions that you may have.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Dr.  Lanzerotti.  I

really appreciate it. Dr. Taylor.
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOSEPH  H.  TAYLOR,  JR.,  CO-CHAIR,  AS-
TRONOMY  AND  ASTROPHYSICS  SURVEY  COMMITTEE,  NA-
TIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES
Dr.  TAYLOR.  Chairman,  Mr.  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  very  much  for  inviting  me  to  testify.  My  name
is  Joseph  Taylor,  and  I  am  Professor  of  Physics  and  former  Dean
of the Faculty at Princeton University. I appear here this morning
in my capacity as Co-Chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Sur-
vey Committee.

The  astronomy  community  has  a  long  history  of  undertaking
broad surveys of astronomical science at 10 year intervals. The sur-
veys  identify  key  scientific  questions  that  need  to  be  answered.
They lay out principal research goals for the next decade, and they
propose new facilities that will make these goals achievable. A dis-
tinguishing  feature  of  the  surveys  is  a  prioritized  list  of  missions
and  facilities  recommended  for  construction,  a  list  that  is  put  to-
gether  with  great  care.  The  National  Science  Foundation  and
NASA  both  use  the  survey  reports  as  a  basis  for  their  planning,
and the vast majority of the projects recommended in previous sur-
veys have been completed. Those projects have much to do with the
leadership  position  our  nation  enjoys  in  the  astrophysical  sciences.
The  most  recent  Survey  Committee  understood  that  a  mid-dec-
ade  servicing  mission  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  would  install
two  important  new  instruments,  a  wide  field  camera,  and  a  spec-
trograph.  The  mission  would  also  service  the  satellite  in  other
ways,  so  that  Hubble  could  remain  productive  throughout  the  dec-
ade,  at  the  end  of  which,  NASA’s  follow-on  facility,  now  called  the
James Webb Space Telescope, would become operational. The Com-
mittee was informed that the mission would cost $350 million, and
that cost estimate helped to shape our final priority list.

The Hubble telescope was a truly remarkable instrument. It has
made enormous contributions to astronomy and it has helped to in-
spire a whole generation of young Americans to go into science, en-
gineering, and the other technical fields that contribute so much to
our  national  prosperity.  My  Committee  was  charged  with  looking
ahead, however, and we concluded that answers to many of the im-
portant  astrophysical  questions  most  ripe  for  scientific  progress  in
this  decade  are  likely  to  be  found  at  spectral  wavelengths  outside
the Hubble telescope’s capabilities.

Two  of  our  three  top  priorities  are  therefore  the  James  Webb
Space  Telescope,  which  will  operate  in  the  infrared,  and  the  Con-
stellation  X-ray  Observatory.  We  can  never  be  sure  of  where  the
next scientific breakthroughs will arise, but the future of those mis-
sions seems particularly bright. The Webb telescope will be able to
observe and examine the very first galaxies that formed in our uni-
verse,  and  the  very  first—the  ignition  of  the  very  first  stars.  Con-
stellation-X will examine how matter and energy behave in the ex-
treme  environments  near  black  holes,  conditions  in  which  some  of
the most fundamental physical theories have never yet been tested.
The  Survey  Committee  made  the  tough  decision  to  push  space  as-
trophysics  into  new  frontiers  in  the  infrared  and  X-ray  regions  of

the spectrum. In this context, it is very difficult for me to say that
knowledge  of  the  premature  loss  of  the  Hubble  would  have  signifi-
cantly altered our priority list. Perhaps the Committee would have
given  higher  ranking  to  a  project  called  the  Space  Ultraviolet  Ob-
servatory,  which  was  omitted  from  our  final  list,  but  I  do  not  be-
lieve that the other priorities would have been much altered.

Mr.  Chairman,  my  Committee  was  making  judgments  about  sci-
entific  payoffs  some  years  in  the  future,  but  I  know  yours  is  grap-
pling  with  decisions  that  need  to  be  made  very  soon.  Accounting
methods  and  other  changes  at  NASA  since  completion  of  our  sur-
vey  now  make  it  seem  very  unlikely  that  a  Shuttle  servicing  mis-
sion  would  cost  the  Science  Directorate  as  little  as  $350  million.
Present estimates seem to run to at least a billion dollars, whether
the  servicing  is  done  by  manned  Shuttle  or  by  robot.  That  cost  is
roughly  the  equivalent  of  a  second  James  Webb  telescope,  and  if
borne  by  NASA’s  science  program  alone,  would  likely  delay  impor-
tant new missions under development, including those ranked very
highly across all fields of space science.

You will hear about possible rehosting of the Hubble replacement
instruments  on  a  new  satellite  called  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe.
Cost estimates for this project are also around a billion dollars, and
the  telescope  might  be  ready  by  the  year  2010.  Such  a  satellite
does  offer  significant  promise.  However,  to  start  work  on  it  now
would  be  to  insert  an  entirely  new  priority  into  the  mission  queue
without  benefit  of  comprehensive  peer  review,  like  those  under-
taken  for  all  existing  survey  priorities.  Though  from  the  point  of
view  of  the  Survey  Committee,  I  believe  that  neither  a  billion  dol-
lar  servicing  mission  nor  a  billion  dollar  rehosting  satellite  should
be  a  higher  funding  priority  than  the  new  astronomical  projects
recommended by the Committee.

Our  nation’s  science  enterprise  has  been  extremely  well  served
by having open, broadly based mechanisms for setting priorities in
astronomy,  and  by  closely  following  those  roadmaps.  I  think  you
will do well to see that the agencies continue to follow the good ad-
vice on priorities they have received.

As  you  know,  I  am  also  a  member  of  the  Committee  on  Assess-
ment of Options to Extend the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope.
I  most  heartily  endorse  that  Committee’s  recommendation  that
NASA should pursue a servicing mission to accomplish the original
objectives  of  the  SM4  servicing  mission.  However,  I  do  not  favor
such a plan, much less the launch of a wholly new satellite to host
the  Hubble  replacement  instruments,  if  it  would  require  major
delays  or  reordering  of  the  Survey  Committee’s  science  priorities.
If NASA follows such a course, I believe it will squander the excel-
lent  reputation  for  scientific  leadership  and  judgment  that  it  has
so rightly earned over the years.

Thank  you  for  your  attention,  and  I  will  be  pleased  to  answer

questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPH H. TAYLOR, JR.

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and Members of the Committee: thank

of  the  Faculty  at  Princeton  University.  I  appear  today  in  my  capacity  as  Co-chair
of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee.

As  you  know,  the  Astronomy  community  has  a  long  history  of  creating,  through
the  National  Research  Council  (NRC),  broad  surveys  of  the  field  at  ten-year  inter-
vals.  These  surveys  lay  out  the  community’s  research  goals  for  the  next  decade,
identify  key  questions  that  need  to  be  answered,  and  propose  new  facilities  with
which  to  conduct  this  fundamental  research.  The  most  recent  decadal  survey,  enti-
tled  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  in  the  New  Millennium,  was  released  in  the  year
2000.1 I have been asked to answer the following questions from my perspective as
the Co-chair of the committee that produced that report:

1. To what extent, and in what ways, was the Decadal Survey premised on the
Hubble Space Telescope having additional instruments that were to be added
by  a  servicing  mission?  Would  the  loss  of  the  Hubble  cause  you  to  entirely
rethink  your  priorities?  Would  that  change  if  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe  or
a similar rehost mission is launched?

2. How important are the contributions that would be expected from extending
the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  when  compared  to  advancements  ex-
pected  from  other  astronomical  programs  at  NASA  to  be  launched  in  the
next decade, such as the James Webb Space Telescope?

3. Should  either  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  (whether  by  robot  or  by  Shuttle)
or a new telescope such as the Hubble Origins Probe be a higher priority for
funding than other astronomical programs at NASA?

In the balance of my testimony I shall address all three questions.
Until  recently,  the  NRC  decadal  survey  was  an  activity  unique  to  the  discipline
of astronomy and astrophysics. The most recent survey involved the direct participa-
tion of 124 astronomers; moreover, the direct participants received input from many
hundreds more of their colleagues. Altogether, a substantial fraction of the Nation’s
astronomers  were  in  some  way  involved  in  the  creation  of  the  report.  By  gathering
such  broad  community  input,  the  survey  process  creates  a  document  that  reflects
the  consensus  opinion  of  the  researchers  in  the  field.  The  value  of  this  activity  to
NASA  and  the  NSF  has  been  demonstrated  in  many  ways,  and  most  recently  by
NASA’s request for the NRC to conduct similar surveys for planetary science,2 solar
and space physics,3 and Earth science.4

The  feature  of  the  decadal  Astronomy  Survey  that  distinguishes  it  from  sum-
maries  of  other  fields  of  science  is  the  prioritized  list  of  missions  and  facilities  that
are  recommended  for  construction.  This  list  is  put  together  very  carefully;  many
worthy  projects  do  not  make  the  list,  while  others  are  deferred  to  the  next  decade.
I  can  assure  you  that  the  decision-making  process  is  very  thorough  and  sometimes
leaves  some  ‘‘blood  on  the  floor,’’  metaphorically  speaking.  One  of  the  factors  that
make  the  process  possible  is  the  remarkable  success  of  the  surveys.  The  National
Science  Foundation  and  NASA  have  used  the  survey  reports  as  the  basis  of  their
planning  processes,  and  the  vast  majority  of  recommended  projects  from  previous
surveys  have  been  completed—even  if  they  have  sometimes  stretched  over  the
boundaries from decade to decade. The completed projects have much to do with the
leadership position of our national enterprise in the astrophysical sciences.

The process of priority setting is based on a set of assumptions. For the purposes
of this hearing, the most important of these is that priorities from previous decades
should be completed. For example, the year 2000 Survey reaffirmed the importance
of  completing  the  Atacama  Large  Millimeter  Array  that  had  been  recommended  in
the  1991  Survey.5 Along  the  same  lines,  the  most  recent  Survey  was  based  on  the
expectation that a Shuttle Servicing Mission would install in the Hubble Space Tele-
scope  new  instruments  called  the  Cosmic  Origins  Spectrograph  and  Wide  Field
Camera-3,  and  would  refurbish  the  satellite  in  other  ways  so  that  Hubble  would
continue to operate until 2010—about the time that the infrared James Webb Space
Telescope  (JWST)  is  planned  to  become  available.6 We  were  told  that  this  mission,
now  referred  to  as  SM–4,  would  cost  $350  million,  and  it  was  one  of  the  consider-
ations that led to the final shape of the priority list.

There  are  a  number  of  strong  arguments  for  keeping  the  Hubble  telescope  oper-
ational  until  JWST  is  ready.  The  new  instruments  will  expand  Hubble’s  reach  far-

ther  into  the  near-infrared  region  of  the  spectrum.  This  capability  will  enable  the
selection  of  potentially  interesting  targets  that  will  form  much  of  the  basis  of  the
initial  JWST  research  program.  The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  is  still  in  the  prime
of  its  scientific  life.  Even  with  some  temporarily  reduced  capacity,  astronomers  are
using it to observe objects that were thought to be beyond any telescope’s capability.
Hubble  is  also  important  to  the  Nation  for  reasons  beyond  its  immediate  scientific
contributions. According to a recent NRC study, nearly one third of all federal sup-
port  for  astronomy  research  is  tied  to  the  Hubble  telescope  and  its  affiliated  re-
search  programs.7 NASA,  in  consultation  with  the  community,  plans  to  transfer
these  programs  to  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  when  it  becomes  operational;
but the premature loss of Hubble would threaten the continuity and vitality of this
research enterprise, and this source of highly trained technical personnel for the Na-
tion.

We  all  love  Hubble.  It  is  truly  a  remarkable  instrument.  That  said,  the  object  of
my committee’s decadal survey was to look ahead and identify the tools that would
be  needed  to  continue  answering  deep  questions  about  the  Universe  and  the  most
fundamental  laws  of  Nature.  In  the  Survey  committee’s  judgment,  in  the  present
decade answers to these questions are more likely to be found in regions of the spec-
trum  outside  the  Hubble  telescope’s  capabilities.  Top  Survey  priorities  such  as
JWST and the Constellation X-Ray (Con-X) observatory will open large spectral win-
dows  on  the  universe  that  are  simply  not  available  to  instruments  on  the  ground.
While  we  can  never  be  sure  where  the  next  scientific  breakthrough  will  arise,  the
future with these missions seems very bright. JWST will be able to observe and ex-
amine  the  very  first  galaxies  that  formed  in  our  Universe,  and  to  study  the  era
when  the  first  stars  ignited.  Con-X  will  be  able  to  observe  how  matter  and  energy
behave near black holes—an extreme environment in which the laws of physics have
not yet been well tested.

The  Survey  does  not  neglect  the  optical  region  of  the  spectrum.  Two  of  the  Sur-
vey’s top three recommendations for ground-based facilities are for new optical tele-
scopes that will observe the universe in new and different ways.8 While Hubble can
do some things that are unmatched by telescopes on the ground, the choice to move
space  astrophysics  into  the  infrared  and  X-ray  regions  of  the  spectrum  was  one  of
the difficult decisions that the committee made. In this context, it is difficult to say
that  the  premature  loss  of  the  Hubble  telescope  would  significantly  alter  the  Sur-
vey’s priority list. It is possible that the committee would have given a stronger pri-
ority  to  the  Space  Ultraviolet  Observatory  (SUVO),  which  was  omitted  from  the
final priority list; but I do not believe that the rest of our list would have been very
different.

Mr.  Chairman,  the  scientific  promise  of  JWST  and  other  Survey  priorities  lies  in
the  future,  while  your  committee  is  grappling  with  decisions  that  need  to  be  made
very  soon.  Accounting  methods  and  other  changes  that  have  taken  place  at  NASA
since  the  completion  of  the  Survey  now  make  it  seem  very  unlikely  that  a  Shuttle
servicing mission would cost the science mission directorate as little as $350 million.
However  the  Hubble  telescope  is  serviced,  present  cost  estimates  seem  to  run  to  at
least $1 billion—roughly equivalent to that of a second JWST. Such a cost, if borne
by the science program, will likely delay a number of other missions that are under
development,  including  those  ranked  highly  in  NRC  decadal  surveys  across  all  of
space science.

One  option  that  I  have  not  yet  mentioned  is  to  host  the  Hubble  replacement  in-
struments  COS  and  WFC3  on  a  new  satellite  like  the  proposed  Hubble  Origins
Probe  (HOP).  According  to  the  team  proposing  HOP,  the  cost  for  such  a  mission
would also be roughly $1 billion, and the telescope would be ready by 2010. The pro-
posal  also  calls  for  an  additional  wide-field  imaging  camera.  Such  a  satellite  offers
significant promise; however, to start work on it would in essence insert a new pri-
ority  into  the  mission  queue,  without  benefit  of  the  kind  of  comparative  review  un-
dertaken  in  the  survey.  From  the  point  of  view  of  the  survey  committee,  I  believe
that neither a $1 billion servicing mission nor a $1 billion rehosting satellite should
be  a  higher  funding  priority  than  the  astronomical  science  priorities  recommended
by the survey committee.

Our  nation’s  science  enterprise  has  been  well  served  by  having  open,  broadly
based  mechanisms  for  setting  priorities  in  astronomy,  and  by  closely  following  the
wise  decisions  made  in  that  way.  A  project  similar  to  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe
could easily be included in the next Astronomy Survey, and would likely be a strong
contender then. As you know, I am also a member of the Committee on Assessment
of Options to Extend the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope. I heartily endorse that

committee’s  recommendation  that  NASA  should  pursue  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission
to Hubble so as to accomplish the objectives of the planned SM–4 mission. However,
I do not favor such a plan, much less the launch of a new satellite to host Hubble’s
replacement instruments, if it would require major delays or re-ordering of the Sur-
vey  Committee’s  science  priorities.  With  such  a  course  of  action,  I  believe  that
NASA  would  squander  the  excellent  reputation  for  scientific  judgment  and  leader-
ship that it has so rightly earned over the years.

I should stress that these opinions are my own, informed by my work on the sur-

vey and other advisory committees and by conversations with many colleagues.

Thank you for your attention, and I would be pleased to answer questions.

STATEMENT OF DR. STEVEN V.W. BECKWITH, DIRECTOR,

SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE

Dr.  BECKWITH.  Chairman  Boehlert,  Mr.  Gordon,  Members  of  the
Committee,  I  deeply  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on
behalf of the Space Telescope Science Institute.

The  Institute,  commonly  called  STSCI,  is  managed  by  OAR
under  contract  with  NASA.  The  Institute  was  set  up  24  years  ago
to  carry  out  the  science  operations  for  Hubble.  More  recently,  we
were  assigned  the  full  responsibility  of  operating  the  spacecraft
itself. We have a vital interest on behalf of astronomers worldwide
to  operate  this  in  the  most  scientifically  productive  manner  pos-
sible.

At the outset, I want to commend the Committee for holding this
hearing on the very important matter. The Hubble Space Telescope
was  designed  to  measure  the  age  of  the  universe,  explore  the  na-
ture  of  distant  galaxies,  measure  the  mass  of  black  holes,  detect
the dark matter between galaxies, study the nature of stars in the
Milky  Way  and  neighboring  galaxies,  and  even  planets  in  our  own
solar  system,  sort  of  the  whole  shebang,  as  we  say  in  astronomy.
It  made  tremendous  progress  on  all  of  these  goals  within  a  few
years  of  launch,  but  more  importantly,  Hubble  opened  up  entirely
new  fields  of  research  not  included  in  its  initial  goals.  Hubble  has
invented  or  captured  entire  subfields  of  astronomy,  such  as  the
study  of  the  creation  of  galaxies,  the  nature  of  dark  energy  in  the
early  universe,  the  study  of  atmospheric  chemistry  in  extra-solar
planets,  that  rank  among  the  premiere  scientific  problems  of  our
time.  The  United  States  has  achieved  preeminence  in  these  areas
with Hubble, a preeminence we do not want to lose.

Just  as  important  as  Hubble’s  scientific  contributions  is  its  im-
pact  on  education  and  public  awareness  of  science.  Hubble  has  be-

come  an  international  icon  of  humankind’s  scientific  prowess.  The
vivid colors and rich information content of its images with unpar-
alleled  resolution  captivate  millions  of  Americans  each  year.
Hubble’s  pictures  make  even  esoteric  concepts  about  the  universe
accessible  to  schoolchildren.  And  if  I  can  just  give  a  personal  re-
mark,  one  of  my  vivid  memories  of  coming  to  Baltimore  six  years
ago was going to Dumbarton Middle School, where both of my chil-
dren were enrolled, on parent visiting night. I saw Hubble pictures
in every classroom on my kids’ schedule, including English, health,
and  social  studies,  in  addition  to  their  science  classrooms.  Hubble
has  been  one  of  our  most  important  tools  to  excite  children  about
science  at  a  time  when  the  need  for  a  technically  astute  workforce
is more important than ever to our economic future.

An  essential  element  of  Hubble’s  enormous  success  is  NASA’s
ability  to  upgrade  the  scientific  instruments  with  modern  tech-
nology  through  servicing  by  Shuttle  astronauts.  Some  of  the  most
important  problems  Hubble  tackles,  such  as  the  dark  energy  and
extra-solar  planet  studies,  were  not  even  active  topics  of  observa-
tional research when Hubble was designed in the 1980s, and there-
fore,  were  not  part  of  Hubble’s  mission  goals.  Hubble’s  enormous
impact  in  helping  us  uncover  the  secrets  of  the  cosmos  has  come
out because it has continually improved through periodic servicing,
and  it  is  a  general  purpose  observatory  that  can  respond  to  new
discoveries in a way that particular targeted missions cannot.

At present, there is no other mission planned or under construc-
tion to duplicate Hubble’s capabilities and major strengths. It is es-
sential  that  we  complete  the  Hubble  mission,  and  let  it  fulfill  its
scientific  potential  in  preparation  for  the  era  that  will  be  domi-
nated  by  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope,  the  Terrestrial  Planet
Finder,  and  other  astronomical  missions  in  NASA’s  strategic  plan.
Fortunately, there are at least two ways to service Hubble, using
the Space Shuttle and using robots, that would realize the great fu-
ture  promise  of  NASA’s  original  plan.  Timeliness  is  an  important
element  of  scientific  success,  as  well  as  mission  success,  and  it
should be a factor in weighing any options to retain Hubble science.
Among  the  proposed  options  you  will  hear  today,  it  appears  now
that  servicing  with  astronauts  would  provide  the  most  expeditious
path. Servicing by robots would be the next most timely option, and
building  a  replacement  would  take  the  longest.  As  a  scientist,  I
would like to see our important scientific capabilities established as
soon as possible, so I favor the servicing of Hubble.

You  will  hear  different  views  today  from  others  more  expert  in
the  risks  and  costs  associated  with  each  option.  One  area  which  I
believe all speakers today will agree, however, is that it is vital for
us  to  preserve  this  scientific  and  education  capability  for  the  Na-
tion.  It  is  definitely  feasible  to  do  so,  and  it  should  become  a  very
high priority for support this year.

I will welcome your questions on any aspect of this issue. Thank

you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEVEN V.W. BECKWITH

1. What are the Hubble Space Telescope’s most important contributions to
the  advancement  of  science?  How  important  are  those  contributions

compared  to  advancements  expected  from  other  astronomical  programs
at NASA, such as the James Webb Space Telescope to be launched in the
next decade?
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was built to measure the age of the universe,
explore  the  nature  of  distant  galaxies,  measure  the  mass  of  black  holes,  detect  the
dark  matter  between  galaxies,  study  the  nature  of  stars  in  the  Milky  Way  and
neighboring galaxies and even planets in our own solar system. It made tremendous
progress  on  all  of  these  goals  within  a  few  years  of  launch.  More  importantly,
Hubble  opened  up  entirely  new  fields  of  research  not  included  in  its  initial  goals.
Hubble  looked  back  close  to  the  time  of  creation  by  observing  the  assembly  of  the
first  galaxies  when  the  universe  was  only  seven  percent  of  its  present  age,  it  con-
firmed that the universe is accelerating, one of the most profound discoveries in 100
years,  it  obtained  images  of  young  solar  systems  around  other  stars  before  planets
had formed, it detected extra-solar planetary systems and even measured the atmos-
pheric  chemistry  of  one  extra-solar  planet.  Most  recently,  Hubble  helped  discover
the most distant object in the Solar System.

The Hubble Space Telescope has far outpaced everyone’s early expectations of suc-
cess.  An  essential  element  of  that  broad  success  is  NASA’s  ability  to  upgrade  the
scientific  instruments  with  modern  technology  through  servicing  by  Shuttle  astro-
nauts. Hubble is currently poised to address several of the most important problems
in  astrophysics,  indeed,  in  all  of  science  over  the  next  five  to  ten  years,  if  new  in-
struments are installed on another servicing mission. Two of these problems, the na-
ture of dark energy that powers the acceleration of the universe and the properties
of  extrasolar  planetary  systems,  were  not  even  active  topics  of  observational  re-
search  when  Hubble  was  designed  in  the  1980’s  and  therefore  were  not  part  of
Hubble’s mission goals. Hubble’s enormous impact in helping us uncover the secrets
of the cosmos has come about because it is a multi-purpose observatory with obser-
vational powers greatly exceeding those required for a single problem or set of prob-
lems that the mission designers could divine before it was launched.

Hubble’s  discoveries  drove  it  to  the  top  of  the  Nation’s  most  productive  scientific
facilities.  By  the  metrics  we  use  to  measure  scientific  success,  Hubble  is  number
one.  It  annually  produces  more  scientific  papers  that  collectively  receive  more  cita-
tions  in  the  scientific  literature  than  any  other  astronomical  observatory  or  instru-
ment.  The  widely  used  Davidson  Science  News  metric,  NASA’s  own  measure  of  the
relative  successes  of  its  different  missions,  ranked  Hubble  number  one  in  science
impact  for  the  last  ten  years.  In  2004,  the  most  recent  year  for  which  this  metric
is  available,  Hubble  had  almost  twice  as  many  important  discoveries  as  the  next
highest producer among NASA missions, and it was the only one of the top 25 most
productive missions to gain discovery points. It shows no signs of slowing down.

Just  as  important  as  Hubble’s  scientific  contributions  is  its  impact  on  education
and  public  awareness  of  science.  Its  pictures  reveal  the  complex  structure  of  gal-
axies and nebulae. The vivid colors and rich information content of its images with
unparalleled resolution captivate millions of Americans and people around the world
each  year.  Hubble’s  pictures  make  even  esoteric  concepts  about  the  universe  acces-
sible  to  school  children.  One  of  my  first  memories  of  coming  to  Baltimore  six  years
ago was going to Dumbarton Middle School on parent visiting night where both my
children  enrolled.  I  saw  Hubble  pictures  in  every  classroom  on  my  kids’  schedule,
including English, social studies, and health in addition to their science classrooms.
Hubble  has  been  one  of  our  most  important  tools  to  excite  children  about  science
at  a  time  when  the  need  for  a  technically  astute  workforce  is  more  important  than
ever to our economic future.

At  present,  there  is  no  other  mission  planned  or  under  construction  to  duplicate
Hubble’s capabilities and major strengths. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
is designed to have the same angular resolution—or sharpness of image—as Hubble
covering  a  different  wavelength  band  and  with  greater  light  gathering  power.  The
tremendous  advances  enabled  by  Hubble  have  driven  the  scientific  community  to
pose  questions  that  were  not  even  imagined  a  decade  ago,  but  now  form  the  basis
for the JWST mission.

The  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  complements  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  as
part  of  a  continuous,  balanced  program  to  study  the  universe  with  flagship  observ-
atories. Hubble’s sensitivity to ultraviolet and visual light and its high performance
now  make  it  an  enormous  value  to  astronomy.  JWST’s  coverage  of  infrared  wave-
lengths and large collecting area will make it an essential asset when it is launched.
JWST’s  anticipated  success  in  the  future  guarantees  its  high  priority  for  the  next
decade.

Because of the strong scientific relationship between HST and JWST, the original
plan  envisioned  by  the  scientific  community  would  have  allowed  an  overlap  of  sev-

eral  years  to  accomplish  an  orderly  transition  of  observing  programs.  We  now  real-
ize  that  HST’s  future  potential  is  even  more  important  than  previously  thought
owing  to  new  discoveries  about  the  universe  and  its  constituents  from  HST  and
other  facilities.  It  is  essential  to  complete  the  HST  mission  and  let  it  fulfill  its  sci-
entific potential in preparation for the era that will be dominated by JWST, the Ter-
restrial Planet Finder, and other astronomical missions in the NASA Strategic Plan.
2. Should a Hubble servicing mission be a higher priority for funding than

other astronomical programs at NASA?
Setting  priorities  for  astronomical  programs  at  NASA  is  normally  done  in  three
ways.  The  first  is  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences’  Decadal  Surveys  done  every
ten  years  to  provide  a  long-term  look  especially  at  large  missions.  The  most  recent
Decadal  Survey  (Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  in  the  New  Millenium  2001)  consid-
ered  NASA’s  plan  to  service  Hubble  with  SM–4  and  operate  it  until  the  end  of  the
decade,  2010.  The  survey  committee  believed  that  was  a  good  plan  and  one  that
they  supported  even  with  the  demands  of  competing  new  instruments  such  as  the
James Webb Space Telescope.

The  second  is  to  have  special  ‘‘blue  ribbon’’  committees  examine  particular  issues
or proposals in between the Decadal surveys. These committees draw their members
from  the  elite  of  the  scientific  establishment  who  are  not  direct  beneficiaries  of  the
missions under review. Two such committees recently reviewed Hubble: the Bahcall
committee  (chartered  by  NASA’s  Office  of  Space  Science)  in  August  2003  and  the
Lanzerotti committee (chartered by the National Academy of Sciences) in December
2004  (Assessment  of  Options  for  Extending  the  Life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope
(2005) ).  Both  committees  had  winners  of  the  most  prestigious  research  prizes  in
science, including the Nobel prize, and the latter committee also had a large number
of  distinguished  engineers,  astronauts,  and  former  senior  managers  from  the  aero-
space  industry,  military,  and  NASA,  including  an  ex-NASA  Administrator.  Both
committees  gave  a  strong  endorsement  to  the  fifth  Hubble  servicing  mission,  SM–
4.  The  Lanzerotti  committee  stated  that  the  future  scientific  returns  from  Hubble
are  likely  to  be  as  important  as  its  past  discoveries.  No  other  NASA  mission  has
been so extensively reviewed by independent committees of such high capability and
prestige.

The  third  is  NASA’s  own  advisory  system.  In  that  system,  representatives  of  dif-
ferent  subfields  of  astronomy  advise  NASA  on  the  relative  merits  or  their  projects.
The most recent resolution about SM–4 came from the Space Science Advisory Com-
mittee (SScAC) meeting of November 2003, in which the committee reaffirmed that
continuing Hubble’s success in this decade with SM–4 is essential to a balanced pro-
gram of high-profile astronomical research.
3. What  are  the  comparative  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing mission, a robotic servicing mission, and a mission to fly elements
of a Hubble servicing mission rehosted on a new telescope?
The  Lanzerotti  report  concludes  that  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission,  SM–4,  would
give  us  the  most  scientific  capability  in  the  shortest  amount  of  time  at  the  lowest
risk  among  the  three  options.  Time  is  an  important  advantage  that  is  often  ne-
glected  as  a  factor  in  scientific  importance.  SM–4  gives  us  two  new  instruments  in
addition  to  Hubble’s  current  suite  in  about  three  years,  continuing  to  provide  over-
lap  with  NASA’s  other  Great  Observatories,  Spitzer  and  Chandra,  for  example.  It
would  extend  Hubble’s  lifetime  another  four  to  six  years  (likely  overlapping  early
operations  of  JWST),  and  it  would  provide  us  with  the  possibility  of  fixing  the  cur-
rently  inoperative  Space  Telescope  Imaging  Spectrograph  to  further  enhance
Hubble’s  scientific  power.  Since  the  instruments  and  other  components  needed  to
service Hubble are nearly ready for flight, the costs to the science budget, exclusive
of  Shuttle  infrastructure  costs,  are  likely  to  be  relatively  low  and  predictable  com-
pared  to  the  four  previous  servicing  missions.  The  chances  of  mission  success  are
very high, as the Lanzerotti report emphasized, consistent with four successful serv-
icing  missions  in  which  18  consecutive  space  walks  achieved  all  of  their  objectives.
A  successful  robotic  servicing  mission  could  give  us  much  of  the  same  new  sci-
entific  capability  as  SM–4  depending  on  how  it  is  planned,  but  somewhat  later  in
time.  It  is  unclear  how  the  cost  of  a  robotic  servicing  mission  would  be  shared  be-
tween the science budget and the budget for the new exploration initiative. It is im-
portant  to  distinguish  between  a  robotic  mission  that  has  the  capability  to  install
the  new  instruments  and  upgrade  Hubble’s  batteries  and  gyroscopes  from  one  that
simply  de-orbits  the  telescope.  NASA  has  committed  to  a  de-orbit  mission  that  by
itself  would  produce  no  new  science.  In  these  remarks,  I  refer  to  a  mission  that
would  upgrade  Hubble’s  scientific  instruments  and  increase  its  lifetime  as  well  as
install a de-orbit module.

The robotic mission would be able to install new instruments, batteries and gyro-
scopes, although it would not be able to repair some of the infrastructure items nor-
mally done by astronauts. Thus, Hubble’s lifetime following a robotic mission is like-
ly  to  be  shorter  than  that  following  SM–4,  although  an  exact  number  is  a  matter
of  debate.  The  chances  of  mission  success  with  robots  are  likely  to  be  smaller  than
for  SM–4,  simply  because  robotic  servicing  is  untested  and  without  the  flexibility
that humans bring to any task with unforeseen problems.

On the other hand, a robotic servicing mission would demonstrate new technology
that could be important to NASA’s new exploration initiative and to future scientific
facilities  that  are  not  accessible  to  humans.  Thus,  the  potentially  higher  cost  and
risk  would  be  offset  by  the  future  potential  of  using  this  technology  for  other  mis-
sions.  Indeed  a  whole  generation  of  future  scientific  missions  might  be  enabled  by
a  robotic  capability  initiated  in  this  decade.  The  robotic  option  also  has  the  advan-
tage  of  providing  Hubble  with  the  de-orbit  module  capability  it  needs  to  be  safely
de-orbited at the end of its life.

The  third  option,  rehosting,  could  recover  some  of  the  science  capabilities  of  a
fully serviced Hubble. I assume here that rehost means building an equivalent sized
telescope  to  Hubble  containing  the  two  new  instruments  already  built,  the  Cosmic
Origins  Spectrograph  (COS)  and  the  Wide  Field  Camera  3  (WFC3)  as  assumed  in
the  Aerospace  Corporation  study  of  alternatives  to  Hubble  servicing.  Such  a  tele-
scope  will  deliver  less  scientific  capability  at  a  much  later  time  with  higher  risk
than  servicing  Hubble.  The  new  telescope  would  have  to  have  a  2.4m  mirror  with
a  pointing  stability  of  a  few  milliseconds  of  arc,  the  most  challenging  part  of
Hubble’s  construction.  That  mission  would  be  launched  in  approximately  eight
years,  according  to  the  Aerospace  study.  Thus,  we  would  have  a  Hubble  Lite  with
two  working  instruments  in  2013  rather  than  a  full  Hubble  with  four  to  five  work-
ing instruments (depending on STIS) in 2007 or 2008.

Time  is  an  important  element  in  this  case,  because  Hubble  Lite  would  become
available after the currently planned launch date of JWST in 2011. JWST’s infrared
capabilities  will  supercede  those  of  WFC3.  The  lack  of  two  of  Hubble’s  current  in-
struments, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Near Infrared Camera and
Multi-Object  Spectrometer  (NICMOS)  means  that  two  of  the  four  most  compelling
future  science  projects  with  Hubble  that  I  discussed  with  the  Lanzerotti  committee
would  be  impossible.  My  understanding  from  the  Aerospace  study  is  that  even
Hubble  Lite  would  cost  the  science  budget  between  $1.5  and  $2  billion,  not  unrea-
sonable  considering  the  cost  to  build  Hubble  in  the  first  place,  but  certainly  higher
than typical costs of a Shuttle servicing mission, less than $500 million. The chances
of mission success would be lower than those for SM–4, simply because of the infant
mortality risk for all new space missions.

It  is,  of  course,  always  possible  to  propose  a  rehost  mission  with  new  capabilities
that  Hubble  does  not  have,  such  as  the  HOP  telescope  consortium  proposes.  Such
a  mission  would  be  scientifically  attractive  by  providing  even  more  capability  than
a Hubble Lite. Depending on the precise proposal and configuration, it could be de-
signed to address specific science problems, such as the dark energy problem. There
are  other  mission  proposals  to  provide  new  telescopes  with  new  capabilities  that
would  have  to  be  weighed  against  one  another,  since  none  have  yet  undergone  the
extensive  reviews  that  the  Hubble  program  has.  It  would  also  not  have  the  public
recognition  that  has  made  Hubble  so  beneficial  to  education  and  public  outreach.
I  assume  that  any  telescope  with  more  capability  than  Hubble  Lite  would  also  be
more  expensive  and  carry  more  development  risk  than  either  a  rehost  mission  or
SM–4.

BIOGRAPHY FOR STEVEN V.W. BECKWITH

Steven  Beckwith  is  the  Director  of  the  Space  Telescope  Science  Institute  on  the
campus  of  Johns  Hopkins  University  in  Baltimore,  Maryland,  and  a  Professor  of
Physics  and  Astronomy  at  JHU.  The  Institute  runs  the  science  operations  for  the
Hubble  Space  Telescope.  As  Director,  he  is  responsible  for  selecting  the  scientific
programs,  supporting  grants,  and  all  data  from  the  telescope.  The  Institute  has  a
staff of approximately 500 people, including 100 scientists and 150 engineers to sup-
port the space observatory.

He  attended  the  engineering  school  at  Cornell  University  as  an  undergraduate
from 1970 to 1973, receiving a B.S. with distinction in Engineering Physics in 1973.
From  1973  to  1978,  he  did  graduate  work  in  physics  at  the  California  Institute  of
Technology, receiving a Ph.D. in Physics in 1978. Following his Ph.D., he joined the
faculty  of  Cornell  University  in  the  astronomy  department,  where  he  taught  for  13
years  as  a  Professor  of  Astronomy.  During  that  time,  he  held  a  number  of  visiting
positions  at  Arcetri  Observatory  (Florence,  Italy),  the  University  of  California  at
Berkeley,  the  California  Institute  of  Technology,  and  the  Max-Planck-Institute  fu¨ r
Astronomie (Heidelberg, Germany). He also founded a small company with his wife,
Ithaca  Infrared  Systems,  and  served  as  President  of  the  company  from  1983  until
1989.  The  company  tested  all  the  short  wavelength  detectors  for  the  Cosmic  Back-
ground Explorer.

In  1991,  he  moved  to  Heidelberg,  Germany  as  one  of  two  directors  of  the  Max-
Planck-Institut fuer Astronomie. He became Managing Director of the that institute
in 1994, where he had responsibility for a staff of approximately 200 people and ran
the  German  national  observatory,  the  Calar  Alto  Observatory,  in  southern  Spain.
He  was  Managing  Director  until  1998,  when  he  moved  back  to  the  United  States
to become the Director of the Space Telescope Science Institute.

His  principal  research  interests  are  the  formation  and  early  evolution  of  planets
including those outside the Solar System, and the birth of galaxies in the early uni-
verse.  He  has  published  over  100  research  articles,  and  lectures  extensively  to  the
general public and professional audiences. He has won several awards in the United
States and Europe for his research and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts
and  Sciences.  He  also  contributes  his  time  to  advisory  committees  on  research  pol-
icy.  He  was  the  chairman  of  the  Science  and  Technical  Committee  of  the  European
Southern  Observatory  for  three  years,  he  chaired  the  European  panel  to  set  prior-
ities  for  space  research  for  all  wavelengths  from  the  ultraviolet  to  the  radio  spec-
trum  (Horizon  2000+),  and  he  was  recently  the  Chairman  of  the  panel  to  set  prior-
ities in ultraviolet through radio space research for the first decade of the new mil-
lennium  as  part  of  the  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Survey  Committee  of  the  Na-
tional  Research  Council  of  the  United  States,  among  other  advisory  contributions.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Dr.  Beckwith.  Dr.

Cooper.
STATEMENT OF DR. PAUL COOPER, GENERAL MANAGER, MDA

SPACE MISSIONS

Dr.  COOPER.  Mr.  Chairman,  Committee  Members,  it  is  a  great
pleasure  and  honor  to  be  here,  and  I  have  to  say  it  is  particularly
an  honor  to  be  representing  the  team  of  extraordinarily  motivated
people that are working as we speak towards the critical design re-
view  of  the  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  Mission.  My  name  is  Paul
Cooper. I am actually the—lead the space robotic activities at MDA
Space Robotics.

I  want  to  start  off  by  putting  a  little  reality  around  this  concept
of  the  robotic  space  mission.  Oh.  I  see  we  don’t  have  me  on  here.
Here we go.

Okay. I want to start out with putting a little reality around this
idea,  and  I  am  actually  going  to  run  a  little  bit  of  a  video  here.  It
is  about  one  minute.  It  starts  off  with  the  real  Hubble  and  the
Space Shuttle arm. It is—we are going to—about to do a real grap-
ple.  This  is  the  view  from  the  arm.  The  basic  goal  here  is  to  grab
this  peg.  The  part  that  I  want  you  to  realize  is  this  very  piece  of
hardware  that  is—it  is—you  are  seeing  is  what  is  planned  for  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

64

mission.  The  only  difference  between  this  piece  of  video  and  what
is really going to be planned, the astronauts are going to be on the
ground instead of the—in the Shuttle.

Once  we  grab  it,  we  do  the  dexterous  servicing.  This  beastie  is
called Dexter. This is it, in titanium glory. It has been flight quali-
fied.  It  is  ready  to  roll.  This  is  the  actual  piece  of  hardware  that
we  are  planning  to  use  to  service  the  Hubble.  It  is  ready  now.  So,
a question arises, which is can this robot do the job, and here, you
see  Dexter  actually  doing  one  of  the  tasks.  This  is  the—basically
the battery jumper cable installation task, and Dexter uses a sense
of touch, which you can more or less see in action right here. With-
out  that,  it  wouldn’t  be  possible,  but  as  you  can  see,  it  is  possible.
There  was  some  doubt  about  whether  Dexter  could  be  controlled
from  a  distance.  Here  are  some  astronauts  in  Houston.  The  robot
and  the  telescope  mockup  are  in  D.C.  here.  This  is  the  wide  field
camera  insertion.  This  is  fairly  realistic  test.  Time  delay,  it  is  the
whole  nine  yards,  no  problem.  So,  we  see  we  have  a  lot  of  reality
already  in  this  mission,  and  I  want  to  turn  now  to  talk  briefly
about the reports that have been issued about it.

This  page  is  about  as  black  and  white  as  it  can  get,  from  our
point  of  view.  I  will  start  quickly  with  the  costs.  The  Aerospace
Corporation suggested the cost of a grapple arm would be $700 mil-
lion. I have to tell you when I saw this, I was pretty amazed that—
I thought maybe we left a lot of money on the table, because frank-
ly,  our  contract  is  $154  million,  firm,  fixed  price,  can’t  go  up,  of
which  a  small  component,  $25  million,  is  for  this  grapple  arm.  So,
we—we are just puzzled by this. The same basic confusion between
this  original  estimate  and  how  our  contract  actually  come  down.
Our contract specifies delivery in 31 months, less than half the es-
timated  time,  with  penalties  if  we  are  late.  Similar  story  on  mis-
sion  risk.  This  robotic  mission  was  rated  a  high  mission  risk,  and
I invite you to look at the track record of Space Robotics, 25 years,
69 missions, not a single mission failure.

Lest  it  be  seen  like  only  the  robotic  is  the  reliable  component,
and  only  the  robotics  can  be  prepared  in  time,  the  Lockheed  story
is  the  same.  This  spacecraft  is  to  be  delivered  in  30  months,  not
66 months. If I back up for a moment and look at the total budget
picture,  there  is  this  estimate  floating  around,  $2  billion,  $2.2  bil-
lion.  We  have  these  two  contracts.  They  add  up  to  a  little  bit  less
than half a billion. We have our colleagues at Goddard. We are one
long way from $2 billion at the moment.

I want to turn briefly to the NAS appraisal. This was an extraor-
dinarily bleak appraisal of the prospects for this mission, which di-
rectly fly in the face of everything we know about the track record
for space robotics. That raises the question, how could this be? And
I  have  a  little  chart  here  that  more  or  less  explains  the  logic  that
you  have  already  heard.  What  it  comes  down  to  is  estimates  of
schedule.  The  Hubble  is  degrading.  If  we  assume  that  we  have  a
project that starts from a clean sheet, that is, we have to figure out
how to do this, it is plausible that it might take 66 months. By the
time  you  get  there,  the  telescope  is  dead.  This  is  not  a  good  plan.
This  is  not  the  reality.  The  reality  of  this  is  the  program  was
conceived  as  starting  from  a  huge  running  start.  It  is  maximally
exploiting existing technology. You saw it hanging there. The same

65

with  the  spacecraft.  The  same  with  the  LIDAR  sensor,  et  cetera,
et  cetera.  If  you  start  from  a  big  running  start,  it  is  much  more
plausible  to  assume  this  project  can  be  done  in  a  shorter  time-
frame. It is not an aggressive schedule if you don’t assume you are
starting  from  a  blank  sheet  of  paper,  and  in  fact,  we  are  also  im-
proving  the  rate  of  the  Hubble  degradation  and  the  total  picture
changes  completely  when  you  realize  that  this  assumption  was
wrong.

If  we  assume  the  schedule  can  be  met,  the  question  then  turns
to  the  real  technical  risks  of  can  we  do  this  job?  And  all  I  can  tell
you  about  this  is  you  don’t  stand  back  and  say  this  is  a  big,  com-
plicated  problem.  What  you  do  is  you  dive  in,  you  break  the  prob-
lem  down  into  pieces,  and  you  see  if  you  can  solve  the  pieces  one
by  one.  And  I  believe  on  the  chart  over  here,  you  can  see  some  of
the  progress  that  is  being  made.  One  of  the  things  we  did  is  we
relentlessly  took  a  real  robot  operating  on  real  mockup  hardware
at  Goddard,  and  we  have  now  executed  every  single  task  that  is
necessary to do the servicing and upgrade operations. This has ac-
tually  been  done.  This  is  the  most  that  we  could  possibly  do  to
prove it is possible prior to actually going and doing it with the tel-
escope.

There are other areas of risk that have been raised. For example,
the  autonomous  rendezvous.  This  is  an  interesting  one.  The  Rus-
sians  have  been  doing  this  for  20  years.  The  Air  Force  knows  that
this  is  an  important  capability  for  the  United  States.  There  is  a
mission  launching  next  month.  The  spacecraft  is  actually  being
fueled  as  we  sit  here.  This  mission  will  launch.  It  will  prove  this
technology  works  by  the  time  of  the  critical  design  review  of  the
Hubble mission, we will know whether this technology works.

The  Committee  also  asked  me  to  comment  briefly  on  the  pros
and cons of the robotics mission versus Shuttle. This is a big topic.
I have one comment to make. The NAS report focuses on the safety
advantage  of  a—or  disadvantage  of  a  single  mission.  The  bottom
line  here  is  if  we  make  a  robot  that  can  do  this  kind  of  servicing,
we have changed the safety tradeoff equation for NASA and astro-
nauts for the rest of time, not just this mission. It is a fairly signifi-
cant fact.

One  last  point  about  the  robots.  The  robots  build  a  capability
that  is  important  for  the  future,  and  for  a  variety  of  uses.  These
include the big observatories of the future of science. These include
national  security  assets  in  orbit.  And  for  sure,  the  exploration  vi-
sion which has been explicitly articulated in terms of just this kind
of robotic capability.

In  short,  we  can  do  this,  and  we  think  it  is  the  right  thing  to

do. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL COOPER

Saving Hubble Robotically: A Wise Choice

NAS Report Overstated Risks

Executive Summary

The  mission  to  save  the  Hubble  robotically  began  October  1,  2004,  with  a  huge
‘‘running  start.’’  Key  elements  of  the  system,  such  as  Dextre  (the  dexterous  robot
that  will  actually  perform  the  servicing  activities),  are  already  built.  Other  major
subsystems are ‘‘build to print’’ of existing technology or require little or no develop-
ment.

Estimates  of  schedule—can  the  mission  be  launched  before  the  Hubble  degrades
too far?—are key to evaluating whether the mission will be successful. The advisory
reports  (one  from  the  Aerospace  Corp.  and  one  from  the  National  Academy  of
Science) derived pessimistic schedule estimates from the faulty assumption that the
program would begin from scratch, with a ‘‘blank sheet of paper.’’ The real situation
clearly  contradicts  this.  One  new  piece  of  data  is  the  delivery  date  for  the  robotic
system:  31  months  (Firm  Fixed  Price  with  penalties  for  late  delivery).  This  is  less
than half the 65 months assumed by the NAS. The actual facts about cost also chal-
lenge early estimates (e.g., robotic grapple arm is $25M versus Aerospace Corp. esti-
mates of $700M).

Since  the  mission  can  be  launched  in  time  to  arrive  before  the  telescope  is  dead,
the  question  that  remains  is  technical  risk.  A  key  mission  task  entailing  some  risk
is  initially  grappling  or  grabbing  the  telescope  following  rendezvous.  This  grapple
task will be executed using a robotic grapple arm and ‘‘end effector’’ (or hand). The
end  effector  will  re-use  an  actual  flight  unit  from  the  Space  Shuttle  manipulator,
and  the  grapple  arm  for  the  mission  is  very  similar  to  the  existing  Shuttle  arms.
Over  25  years,  the  Shuttle  manipulator  has  executed  69  missions,  including  142
grapple operations, without a single mission failure. This track record includes grap-
pling the Hubble itself on five occasions.

In  short,  the  NAS  report  significantly  over-stated  the  risks  associated  with  the

robotic mission to save the Hubble.

The  NAS  report  recommended  a  Shuttle-based  rescue  mission  for  servicing
Hubble. If the decision were a simplistic man versus machine choice, the best choice
would  be  astronauts.  But  if  one  asks  the  broader  question:  ‘‘How  does  NASA  best
deploy  its  Shuttles,  astronauts,  and  robotic  technology?’’,  risking  astronaut  lives  to
change batteries seems shortsighted.

Finally,  it  was  not  within  the  scope  of  the  NAS  report  to  consider  the  value  of
the various mission options, beyond saving the Hubble. But the robotics mission has
a  clear  advantage  in  this  regard.  For  example,  there  is  little  of  value  to  be  learned
by having astronauts do something they have done four times before. The capability
for  robotic  servicing  in  space,  on  the  other  hand,  is  important  to  the  future  of
science, national security and exploration.

To  be  more  specific,  since  the  future  of  astronomy  is  with  large  instruments  out-
side the Shuttle’s reach, robots that can service and upgrade them are likely crucial
to  the  future  of  astronomy.  For  national  security,  the  ability  to  robotically  inspect
and service large DOD assets in orbit is important. And the Nation’s exploration vi-
sion has already been explicitly articulated in terms of humans and robots working
together.  Robots  will  be  necessary,  for  example,  to  assemble  and  maintain  space-
craft, staging depots, and infrastructure.

To summarize, the robotic servicing mission will be successful saving the Hubble,

while also contributing to the future of science, security and exploration.
1 Introduction

Good morning Mr. Chairman, Committee Members. It’s a tremendous honor to be
invited to be here, and it’s a particular honor to be representing the team of extraor-
dinarily  motivated  people  working  as  we  speak  towards  the  Robotic  Servicing  Mis-
sion Critical Design Review in the fall.

I  am  Paul  Cooper;  I  lead  the  space  robotics  business  at  MDA  Space  Missions,

which for 25 years has been NASA’s space robotics partner.

Let  me  first  reinforce  that  saving  the  Hubble  is  an  important  and  worthy  goal;
in fact, it is among our engineers’ proudest achievements to have played a key role
in  the  four  earlier  servicing  missions,  as  well  as  the  initial  deployment  of  the  tele-
scope.

67

Among the options for servicing the telescope, we believe that the robotic servicing
mission,  already  underway,  is  the  right  choice.  In  particular,  we  feel  that  the  re-
cently  released  reports  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  and  the  Aerospace
Corporation  have  significantly  over  estimated  the  risks  associated  with  saving
Hubble robotically.
2 The Robotic Servicing Mission

I  assume  that  the  Committee  may  already  be  aware  of  the  mission  profile  for

Hubble robotic servicing, but nevertheless here’s a quick summary:

• Launch  of  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  Robotic  Vehicle  (HRV)  on  an  Atlas

V or Delta IV expendable launch vehicle.

• The  HRV  will  consist  of  two  separate  spacecraft:  the  De-orbit  Module  (DM)

and the Ejection Module (EM).

• HRV rendezvous with HST.
• Capture  of  HST  using  a  42-foot  long  Grapple  Arm  (similar  to  the  Shuttle
Robotic  Arm  but  slightly  shorter);  the  Grapple  Arm  will  then  be  used  to  at-
tach the HRV to the HST.

• Grapple  Arm  releases  HST  and  picks  up  Dextre  (or  Special  Purpose  Dex-

terous Manipulator).

• Dextre is used to perform servicing mission tasks:
• Robotically connect new battery packs to HST
• Robotically connect new gyros to HST
• Change-out Wide Field Camera
• Change-out Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
• Other servicing tasks

• At  the  conclusion  of  the  HST  Robotic  Servicing  Mission,  the  EM  (along  with
all  the  robotic  servicing  equipment)  will  be  separated  from  the  HRV,  leaving
the DM attached to the HST.

• At  the  conclusion  of  (extended)  HST  scientific  life,  HRV–DM  will  safely  de-

orbit Hubble into the Pacific Ocean.

Figure 1 shows the Hubble with the HRV attached and the robots deployed.
The  Hubble  robotics  servicing  mission  is  also  illustrated  in  a  NASA  movie  that
can  be  found  at  the  NASA  Goddard  website  (http://hubble.nasa.gov/missions/
intro.php).

2.1 Mission Status

As of February 1, 2005 the mission has progressed significantly, and is on sched-
ule for a late 2007 launch, beginning with an October 1, 2004 start date. The major
subcontracts are in place (for the supply of the De-orbit Module and the Robotic Sys-
tem), and a large team is ramped up and working at speed both within and outside
of NASA.

The  Mission  Preliminary  Design  Review  is  scheduled  for  March  2005,  with  Crit-

ical Design Review to follow in early September 2005.

These  ‘‘design’’  reviews  suggest  that  the  mission  is  still  on  the  drawing  boards.
But  due  to  the  heavy  re-use  of  existing  technology,  progress  is  far  further  ahead
than one might envision.

For example, for the two major elements of the robot system, in one case (the use
of  the  Space  Station  Dextre  for  Hubble  instead  of  Station)  the  major  components
are  already  essentially  complete,  and  where  new  hardware  is  being  built  (e.g.,  for
the  Grapple  Arm),  we  have  already  begun  cutting  titanium  forgings  to  make  the
new gears.

In  another  example,  a  few  weeks  ago  NASA  Goddard  received  a  deliverable  from

Draper: software to control the spacecraft during autonomous rendezvous.

In other words, the robotic servicing mission is not a half-baked notional plan, but

is a rapidly maturing reality being assembled from prior work.
3 Overall Orbital Robotics Track Record

Figure  2  is  emblematic  of  the  trust  that  NASA  has  developed  in  space  robotics:
not only does it show humans and robots working together, but it shows one of the
space program’s most valuable assets—an astronaut—literally hanging from a robot
during Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA).

69

The  most  well-known  space  robot,  the  Shuttle  Remote  Manipulator  System,  has
been  flying  since  1981.  It  has  performed  69  missions  without  a  single  mission  fail-
ure.  The  same  system  has  also  been  successfully  used  four  times  to  grapple  the
Hubble  Space  Telescope  and  to  support  subsequent  EVA  servicing  missions  for  the
Hubble.

This  track  record  is  particularly  relevant  because  the  robotic  servicing  mission
plan calls for the use of a robotic arm nearly identical to the Shuttle arm, including
the  re-use  of  a  actual  Shuttle  flight  ‘‘end  effector’’  (the  ‘‘hand’’  on  the  end  of  the
arm).

More  recently,  new  robotic  systems  have  been  developed  for  the  construction  and
maintenance  of  the  International  Space  Station,  including  Dextre,  to  be  described
momentarily. Unmanned robotic missions for DOD applications in Low-Earth Orbit
(LEO) have also been developed.

Beyond LEO, the heritage and operational reliability of the many robots that have
been the workhorse of planetary science are relevant, include the current MER rov-
ers on Mars.
4 Aerospace Corporation Report

In our opinion, the Analysis of Alternatives report from the Aerospace Corporation
was overly pessimistic in its view of robotic servicing. Table 1 summarizes our view
of  the  difference  between  what  are  now  known  facts  concerning  the  robotics  ele-
ments, and what the report asserted.

4.1 Cost

The  Aerospace  Corporation  report  has  suggested  that  a  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing
Program  will  cost  more  than  US$2B,  with  a  grapple  arm  incremental  cost  of  ap-
proximately US$700M. The fact of the matter is that MDA has entered into a Firm
Fixed Price Contract with NASA at US$154M to provide a grapple arm plus a dex-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

terous robot and other accessories. (The share of the contract devoted to the grapple
arm amounts to $25M.)
4.2 Schedule

The Aerospace Corporation report suggested that a Hubble Robotic Servicing Pro-
gram will take at least 66 months to execute. Again, the fact is that on the robotics
portion  of  the  mission,  MDA  has  contractually  committed  to  NASA  to  deliver  the
robotics  systems  within  31  months,  with  the  potential  for  negative  financial  con-
sequences if delivery is late.

As for the spacecraft portion of the mission, the Aerospace Corporation has drawn
their  schedule  conclusion  based  on  a  diverse  and  not  necessarily  compatible  data
set, including a mix of manned and unmanned missions, U.S. and foreign Programs,
and so on. As shown in Figure 3, a very different perspective will emerge using data
points  that  reflect  new  spacecraft  development  that  is  not  ‘‘done  from  scratch’’  but
nonetheless yields a new integrated product. We believe that this perspective is rep-
resentative of the current Hubble Robotic Servicing Program run by NASA Goddard,
which maximizes the use of existing technologies and subsystems to support a ‘‘run-
ning start’’ and not a ‘‘white sheet of paper’’ approach. This approach suggests that
a  roughly  40  month  schedule  for  the  Program  is  entirely  plausible,  and  not  the  66
month schedule that has been suggested.

4.3 Development Risk
4.3.1 Robot System

The Aerospace Corporation report suggested that a Hubble Robotic Servicing Pro-
gram  has  high  development  and  mission  risks.  Development  risk  is  defined  as  the
risks  associated  with  preparing  the  mission  in  time.  Mission  risk  is  defined  as  the
risk associated with executing the mission successfully. (Although for the NAS mis-
sion risk was defined as the risk of failing to achieve mission objectives.)

The  overall  evaluation  was  dominated  by  the  estimate  of  the  schedule  necessary
to  mount  the  mission.  In  short,  if  the  telescope  has  a  high  likelihood  of  being  dead
by the time the rescue mission reaches it, the mission is a failure.

Because  the  Robot  System  for  Hubble  servicing  either  uses  hardware  that  is  al-
ready  built  or  leans  heavily  on  existing  hardware,  there  is  practically  no  develop-
ment  risk.  The  primary  example  is  Dextre.  A  picture  of  the  completed  and  flight-
qualified Dextre, hanging in our Cleanroom, is shown in Figure 4. This is the actual
robot  that  will  be  used  to  service  the  Hubble;  the  only  planned  change  is  to  add  an
additional camera. (A copy of Dextre will be built for later use on the Space Station.)

For  another  extremely  important  element  of  the  Robot  System—the  End  Effector
that  will  actually  grapple  the  Hubble  and  pick  up  Dextre—the  plan  is  to  re-use  a
Shuttle flight unit that has already successfully performed this critical operation on
orbit dozens of times.

In short, for the Robotic System, development risk is minimal. Hence the willing-
ness  of  the  contractor  to  enter  into  a  Firm  Fixed  Price  contract  with  a  31  month
schedule.
4.3.2 Other Mission Elements

Is  there  then  some  other  critical  mission  element  that  is  being  developed  from
scratch,  for  which  the  assumed  schedule  of  66  months  makes  more  sense?  The  an-
swer,  in  short,  is  no.  The  de-orbit  vehicle  is  also  on  an  approximately  30  month
schedule,  and  maximizes  re-use  of  existing  technology.  A  key  sensor  for  the  ren-
dezvous  (the  ‘‘lidar’’)  is  a  re-build  of  a  sensor  just  delivered  a  few  months  ago  for
a  separate  mission.  The  situation  is  similar  for  basically  all  the  key  components  of
the mission, including the software for controlling the spacecraft during rendezvous.
4.4 Mission Risk

The  Aerospace  report  analyzed  ‘‘mission  risk’’  as  the  concatenated  probability  of

failure of specific subsystems and mission tasks.

As  a  starting  point,  consider  the  Aerospace  analysis  of  the  probability  of  mission
success for the De-orbit Option using a grapple arm: 93 percent. A key thing to un-
derstand about the De-orbit mission profile is that it contains almost all the signifi-
cant risks of the servicing mission, specifically the need to autonomously rendezvous
with and grapple a potentially tumbling telescope.

Once the telescope is grappled and the rescue vehicle is berthed, the mission risk
reduces  down  to  the  risk  of  successfully  executing  the  specific  repair  and  upgrade
operations.

But  while  the  Aerospace  report  was  guessing  at  the  likelihood  of  specific  compo-
nent  and  task  failures,  NASA  Goddard  (working  in  concert  with  engineers  from
MDA Space Missions) was systematically performing each operation using real hard-
ware—that  is,  using  the  Earth-bound  version  of  Dextre  operating  on  the  Hubble
high fidelity mockup.

NASA  summarized  this  intensive  risk  retirement  activity  in  this  way:  ‘‘A  space-
flight qualified robot has successfully demonstrated that all life-extension tasks and
science instrument change-outs can be robotically performed.’’ (A comprehensive list
of  the  tasks  performed  and  the  dates  upon  which  they  were  executed  is  included
in Appendix C.)

It  would  be  difficult  to  do  further  work  to  retire  mission  risks;  the  next  logical
step is to actually execute the mission. Based on these new facts, one can now esti-
mate  the  likelihood  of  successfully  executing  the  whole  servicing  operation  as  simi-
lar  to  the  likelihood  of  succeeding  at  the  de-orbit  mission,  e.g.,  in  the  90  percentile
range.
4.5 Summary on Aerospace Report

I  would  like  to  summarize  our  reaction  to  the  Aerospace  Corporation  Report  as

follows:

• Aerospace  Corp.  Reported  Baseline  Assessment  for  Robotic  Servicing  Pro-
• Alternative  Assessment:  ∼  US$1.3B,  3.5  years  plausible,  little  development

gram: US$2B, 5.4 years, high development risk, high mission risk

risk, 90 percent or higher probability of mission success

5 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report: Risk Overstated
5.1 Overall Mission Risk Appraisal

The  NAS  report  concluded  with  a  remarkably  pessimistic  appraisal  about  the
prospects for the robotic mission: an 80 percent chance of mission failure is asserted.
This seems to fly in the face of everything known about the track record of space
robotics, so how could this conclusion have been arrived at? The assertion is derived
mainly from two guesses: a guess as to how long it will take to mount the mission,
and  a  guess  as  to  how  slowly  the  Hubble  will  degrade,  i.e.,  in  what  state  will  the
telescope be when the robotic rescue mission reaches it?

The  NAS  report  inherited  its  schedule  assumptions  in  large  part  from  the  Aero-
space report, and the same consequences follow as described earlier. Since in reality
the  Hubble  robotic  rescue  is  starting  from  a  ‘‘running  start’’  (e.g.,  maximal  utiliza-
tion of existing technology) we can reasonably expect the mission to be launched be-
fore the telescope degrades to the point where it cannot be repaired.

Also,  continuing  progress  is  being  made  in  slowing  the  Hubble’s  rate  of  degrada-
tion,  further  mitigating  the  risk  to  mission  success  from  schedule.  If  the  risks  due
to schedule are removed, what remains as a real threat to the mission’s success are
technical risks.
5.2 NAS Technical Risks

The  NAS  report  identified  a  number  of  areas  of  technical  concern.  We  discuss
these  risks,  and  highlight  in  particular  the  risk  mitigation  progress  that  has  been
made since the report was published.
5.2.1 Grapple Events

The  NAS  report  expressed  concern  that  each  grapple  event  was  a  source  of  risk,
e.g.,  initially  grappling  the  telescope,  releasing  the  telescope,  and  subsequently
grappling Dextre.1 Each event requires making a mechanical connection and in the
case of grappling Dextre, establishing an electrical connection as well.

In  a  nutshell,  this  concern  is  misplaced.  The  mission  plan  calls  for  the  re-use  of
a reliable End Effector from the Shuttle robotic arm, proven through dozens of uses
in  space.  Literally  hundreds  of  grapple  operations  have  been  performed  with  iden-
tical  hardware  over  the  past  decades.  (Appendix  A  summarizes  the  performance  of
the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System.)
5.2.2 Time-delayed Control

The  NAS  report  expressed  concern  about  the  risks  related  to  operating  on-orbit
robots from the ground via time-delayed control2. There is no doubt that time-delay
will be present when controlling the robots, since for example, the signal will travel
via the TDRSS data relay satellite.

Since  the  report  was  issued,  two  significant  developments  have  transpired  that
suggest the risks inherent in time-delayed control are less than the NAS report sug-
gests.

First, following a one-year review process, ground control of Space Station robotics
recently  passed  the  NASA  Space  Station  Safety  Review  panel  in  September  2004.
This process was driven by need: astronaut time on-orbit is scarce and valuable, and
if robots can perform mundane tasks while controlled from the ground, on-orbit pro-
ductivity  will  increase.  (This  same  trade-off  applies  more  broadly  for  the  Hubble

73

mission.)  As  one  can  imagine,  the  safety  review  involved  an  extreme  in-depth  scru-
tiny  of  the  risks  involved  with  time-delayed  control  of  on-orbit  robots.  Ground  con-
trol is set to be commissioned on-orbit in February 2005. There is no doubt that dur-
ing 2005 (prior to the Hubble robotic mission CDR in the fall), much will be learned
from operational experience. These lessons can be incorporated into planning for the
Hubble mission, which uses substantially the same ground control system.

Second,  risk  mitigation  testing  specifically  aimed  at  addressing  this  question  has
been ongoing at Goddard. Since the NAS report, numerous tests of the Earth-bound
version of the Dextre robot have been performed. Shuttle astronauts at the Johnson
Space  Center  remotely  operated  the  robot  at  NASA  Goddard  to  extract  the  Wide
Field  of  View  Camera  2  (WFOC–2)  and  insert  the  WFOC–3  overcoming  technical
challenges  such  as  control  time  delays  of  two  seconds.  In  a  separate  set  of  tests,
variable control time delays of up to eight seconds were generated during the extrac-
tion  of  the  COSTAR  instrument  and  replacement  of  the  COS  instrument.  These
tests  independently  varied  the  video  and  force  feedback  time  delays.  Other  tests
have demonstrated that astronaut control is achievable even in operations in which
astronauts are provided with inadequate camera views of the worksites. Our testing
shows that the mission is wholly feasible under the constraints of time delay.
5.2.3 Autonomous Rendezvous

The NAS report highlights the risk of autonomous rendezvous as one of the most
serious  to  be  faced  by  the  mission.  In  fact,  the  report  asserts  that  this  ‘‘has  never
been done.’’ 3

Russian spacecraft have been routinely executing automatic rendezvous and dock-
ing  missions  using  technology  developed  in  the  early  80’s.  Table  2  summarizes  au-
tonomous rendezvous and docking with Russian spacecraft.

The importance of autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations has been rec-
ognized  by  the  U.S.  space  community  for  some  time.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  a
significant development activity in place for many years, and a sequence of missions
is planned to validate and demonstrate these capabilities. All these missions will fly
prior to the Hubble mission, with time enough to incorporate ‘‘lessons learned.’’ Mis-
sions  devoted  to  examining  autonomous  rendezvous  and/or  capture/docking  include
the  XSS–11  mission  for  the  Air  Force  Research  Labs  (scheduled  for  launch  March
2005),  the  DARPA  Orbital  Express  mission  (scheduled  for  launch  in  2006),  and  the
DART mission.

The initial concepts for rendezvous and capture were developed during the Gemini
and  Apollo  programs.  The  Shuttle  has  demonstrated  that  these  can  be  performed
for  a  more  general  set  of  LEO  missions  and  has  developed  a  wide  variety  of  ap-
proach trajectories and control strategies. These missions demonstrated many of the
automated  guidance,  navigation  and  control  functions  required  today  for  autono-
mous rendezvous and capture. For both Apollo and Shuttle, the rendezvous planning
was performed on the ground, but the on-board system was able to target and auto-
matically  control  the  rendezvous  burns.  The  final  capture/docking  phase  was  con-
trolled  manually  by  the  crew.  The  Shuttle  on-board  GN&C  is  able  to  automatically
perform  many  of  the  necessary  rendezvous  functions,  including  relative  navigation,
targeting and control. Attitude control is done automatically, and translational con-
trol  is  done  manually  based  upon  Rendezvous  and  Prox  Ops  Planner  (RPOP)  soft-
ware that runs on a laptop computer in the cockpit.

The crew enters data into the laptop from the hand-held radar and the Trajectory
Control Sensor (LIDAR), and the RPOP program computes the burn plan. The crew
manually  performs  the  final  docking  maneuvers  using  the  cameras  and  data  from
the  vision  sensors.  The  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  mission  will  require  full  automa-
tion  of  these  functions,  but  the  fundamental  techniques  for  rendezvous,  proximity
operations, and capture of a stable target have been adequately demonstrated.

74

The  significant  remaining  technical  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  for  the
AR&C  phase  of  the  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  mission  are  the  autonomous  oper-
ations, and the relative sensing and subsequent capture of a tumbling target.
XSS–11

As  of  Feb.  1,  2005,  the  XSS–11  spacecraft  is  being  fueled  for  launch  in  a  few
weeks.  The  automation  aspects  of  autonomous  rendezvous  are  fully  addressed  with
the  XSS–11  mission  plan,  which  will  perform  completely  several  fully  autonomous
rendezvous  and  operations  in  proximity  to  several  uncooperative  targets.  The  soft-
ware to affect an autonomous rendezvous and capture has been developed and test-
ed in a 6 degree-of-freedom (6DOF) gantry facility at Lockheed Martin.

A  version  of  this  software  suitable  for  the  Hubble  mission  rendezvous  and  prox-
imity  operations  from  long  range  into  a  10  foot  offset  point  has  been  developed  by
Draper  Lab,  and  has  already  been  delivered  to  Lockheed  for  the  purpose  of  con-
ducting  simulation  demonstrations  of  the  autonomous  Hubble  rendezvous  and  cap-
ture.

The  XSS–11  mission  relies  on  a  laser-based  Lidar  vision  system  for  rendezvous
and  docking.  By  detecting  the  reflection  of  a  laser  beam,  the  Lidar  will  detect  fea-
tures  on  objects  that  are  less  than  half  an  inch  in  size  from  a  distance  of  almost
two  miles.  The  same  Lidar  will  be  used  on  the  Hubble  Robotic  servicing  mission.
The  on-orbit  performance  of  the  entire  XSS–11  rendezvous  system,  including  sen-
sor, will be known by the September 2005, when the Critical Design Review is sched-
uled for the Hubble robotic mission.

In  addition,  extensive  ground  validation  of  the  autonomous  capture  operations  is
ongoing  for  the  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  mission.  The  6DOF  proximity  operations
necessary  to  match  the  rotation  of  a  tumbling  HST  have  been  demonstrated  in  a
high fidelity simulation by Draper Lab. It should be noted that the estimated worst
case rotation rate is very slow at 0.22 deg/second (or only 2.2 revolutions per hour).
5.2.4 System Integration

The NAS report also highlighted the risks associated with the overall task of inte-
grating and testing the entire system. Since the NAS fact finding sessions, the pro-
gram  has  actually  begun,  and  NASA  Goddard  has  substantially  matured  its  plan
for System Integration. This plan is included as Appendix B.
5.2.5 Robotic Repair Operations Actually Performed on Hubble Mockup

One  thing  that  was  remarkable  in  its  absence  from  the  NAS  report  was  any  dis-
cussion  of  the  extensive  efforts  that  have  gone  on  at  Goddard  in  the  past  year  to
prove,  by  having  the  ground  test-bed  version  of  Dextre  actually  execute  the  oper-
ations  on  the  high  fidelity  mockup  of  Hubble,  that  all  the  operations  could  be  exe-
cuted.  In  other  words,  predominately  since  the  NAS  report  fact  finding,  a  space-
flight qualified robot has successfully demonstrated that all life-extension tasks and
science instrument change-outs can be robotically performed.
Appendix C describes these operational tests in more detail.

5.3 Robotics’ Risk Summary
5.3.1 The Robotic Mission Will Have Time and Be Flexible

Perceptions  of  how  the  robots  will  operate  can  affect  inferences  about  associated
risk.  Sometimes,  it  seems  like  people  imagine  that  the  robotic  rescue  mission  is
going  to  be  like  a  car  assembly  operation—that  it  can  only  be  done  one  way  and
if  that  way  fails  we’re  stuck.  Alternatively,  people  imagine  that  while  an  astronaut
is driving the robot from on the Earth, something is going to happen really fast that
we won’t be able to deal with.

But both these perceptions are wrong.
Previous Shuttle-based Hubble Servicing Missions, although very successful, have
relied  on  quick  execution  of  EVA  tasks  on  a  very  tight  timeline  that  is  counted  in
hours and days.

The  robots,  however,  won’t  need  oxygen,  and  we’ll  have  lots  of  time—weeks  or
months  if  necessary—to  go  slow,  evaluate  what’s  happening,  make  adjustments,
make  multiple  attempts  at  operations,  and  re-plan  if  necessary.  For  example,  we
have two arms to use, even though the nominal operations plan calls for using only
one most of the time.

We have seen with the current Mars rovers a very compelling example of how ro-
bots  can  recover  from  problems,  and  do  amazing  things  in  much  more  difficult  cir-
cumstances  (e.g.,  much  longer  time  delays  for  control)  than  what  we  are  looking  at
for Hubble.

In short, the robot mission will be much more flexible than people imagine.

5.3.2 The Next Step: Fly the Mission

It  is  our  opinion  that  the  robotic  risks  for  the  Hubble  robotic  servicing  mission
have been largely overstated by the NAS report. Key identified risks in autonomous
rendezvous and grapple have either already been largely demonstrated or are to be
fully  demonstrated  on  missions  such  as  XSS–11,  DART  and  Orbital  Express.
Ground  control  of  Space  Station  robot  has  already  passed  NASA  safety  review  and
is  scheduled  for  a  first  demonstration  in  February  2005.  Critical  Hubble  servicing
robotic  operations  have  been  tried-out  on  the  ground  using  flight-representative
robotic and Hubble mockups remotely operated over long distances. The key robotics
risks  for  the  mission,  in  our  opinion,  have  hence  been  largely  retired,  and  the  next
logical step is actually to fly it.
6 Alternative Mission Options
6.1 Shuttle Servicing Option

The NAS report recommends using a Shuttle mission to service the Hubble. If one
allows  for  the  possibility  that  a  robotic  mission  is  likely  to  be  successful,  a  robotic
option becomes the preferred option.

On this question there is no debate: ‘‘Which is more intelligent and flexible, astro-
naut or robot, and thus more likely to succeed in performing Hubble servicing activi-
ties?’’  Everyone  would  agree  that  an  astronaut  is  more  likely  to  be  successful.  This
is not, however, the fundamental question needing to be addressed.

The  broader  question  is  something  more  like:  ‘‘Given  the  available  assets  for  use
in space, including Shuttles, astronauts, robots, ELVs, etc., what is the best way of
allocating these assets to the tasks to be accomplished?’’

Servicing  the  Hubble  robotically  has  compelling  value  when  considered  in  this

light:

1) It  liberates  scarce  resources—Shuttles  and  astronauts—for  other  tasks  that

cannot be achieved using a robotic mission

2) It allows the Shuttle to be retired sooner
3) Astronaut lives are not risked on this mission
4) A  capability  is  developed  that  can  be  used  on  other  missions  (this  is  de-

scribed momentarily)

Astronauts  changing  batteries?  It  appears  short-sighted,  and  certainly  we  will

need other more economically appropriate alternatives in the long run.
6.2 De-orbit Only Option

It  is  our  understanding  that  at  a  minimum,  a  robotic  de-orbit  mission  of  the
Hubble  has  to  be  mounted,  in  order  to  avoid  an  eventual  uncontrolled  re-entry  of
the  telescope,  and  thus  ensure  public  safety.  The  Aerospace  Corporation  report  as-
serted  that  a  de-orbit  mission  using  a  robotic  grapple  arm  for  Hubble  capture  has
a 93 percent probability of mission success.

From a robotics point of view, the key fact about a de-orbit mission is this: adding
servicing  to  a  de-orbit  mission  adds  only  relatively  small  incremental  risk  and  cost.
Put another way: Since the key mission risks of ‘‘autonomous rendezvous and grap-
ple’’  are  the  same  for  the  servicing  and  de-orbit  missions,  why  not  do  the  servicing
too?

This  logic  is  particularly  compelling  if  the  telescope  is  dying  anyway,  and  there
is  little  to  lose  by  trying  to  fix  it.  The  servicing  mission  will  only  add  incremental
costs and small incremental risks, while producing very significant paybacks.
6.3 Rehosting

Another  alternative  that  has  been  proposed  is  rehosting  the  science  instruments
intended  for  the  Hubble  upgrade  on  another  new  platform  similar  to  the  Hubble.
It  is  certainly  beyond  the  scope  of  this  witness  to  comment  on  the  technical  and
economic  challenges  of  building  space  telescopes,  and  the  potential  science  value
that may result.

It may perhaps be useful to note, however:
A  new  telescope  contributes  nothing  to  the  Hubble  problems—at  a  minimum,  a
still-expensive  de-orbit-only  mission  must  be  mounted  for  Hubble.  But  the  incre-
mental cost of adding servicing to a de-orbit mission is certainly much less than the
cost of developing a rehosting solution.

Unlike  the  robotic  mission,  constructing  a  new  telescope  is  unlikely  to  make  a

substantial contribution to any other space mission goals.

7 The Future

Unlike  the  other  options  for  servicing  the  Hubble,  developing  a  robotic  servicing

capability would be extremely valuable for other national needs in space.
7.1 Science

The  future  in  astronomy  is  to  place  larger  instruments  well  beyond  low  Earth
orbit,  for  example  at  Lagrangian  Points  such  as  L2  (which  is  beyond  the  Moon).
These  distances  are  so  far  that  they  are  beyond  the  reach  of  the  Shuttle.  Robotic
servicing offers scientists the ability to upgrade these instruments as our knowledge
of  the  universe  unfolds.  The  Hubble  Robotics  Servicing  Mission  will  provide  sci-
entists with a proven method for building ever better instruments.
7.2 National Security

Akin  to  extending  the  life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  the  Department  of  De-
fense  (DOD)  is  seeking  to  extend  the  life  of  critical  military  space  assets  by  per-
forming on-orbit servicing. The XSS–11 and Orbital Express missions are developing
and  testing  the  necessary  technologies  for  servicing  military  satellites  on-orbit.  The
DOD  has  decided  to  use  robots  for  autonomous  rendezvous  and  docking,  refueling,
repair  and  other  tasks.  The  DOD  will  benefit  from  the  experiences  gained  on  the
Hubble Robotics Servicing Mission.
7.3 Exploration

Future  Space  Exploration  Programs  will  undoubtedly  need  to  maximize  sustain-
able  affordability,  maximize  safety,  improve  mission  success  effectiveness  and  ad-
vance  the  state-of-the-art  with  each  mission.  Future  missions  will  also  need  to
achieve the right balance between humans and robots working collaboratively, given
some  of  the  far  mission  locations  and  the  high  costs  and  complexity  of  conducting
human-only  missions.  Robotics  advancement  will  open  new  alternatives  that  can
contribute  increased  safety  and  mission  success,  while  lowering  overall  mission
costs. NASA is already embarking on its vision to use humans and robots in tandem
to  explore  the  universe.  Humans  are  to  perform  the  analysis  and  discovery  and
manage dynamic environments while robots will complement humans by performing
routine  tasks  such  as  the  maintenance  of  spacecraft  staging  depots  and  infrastruc-
ture.

More  specifically,  the  proposed  Hubble  Robotics  Mission  will  serve  as  a  key  step-
ping  stone  for  NASA’s  new  vision  for  Space  Exploration,  by  acting  as  a  precursor
and  testbed  for  effective  closely  coupled  human  and  robotic  partnerships  in  Explo-
ration.  Astronauts  have  already  well  proven  themselves  on  previous  Hubble  Serv-
icing  and  other  manned  missions  in  Low-Earth  Orbit  and  on  the  Moon.  Now  is  the
right  time  to  extend  the  reach  of  astronauts  by  introducing  more  sophisticated  re-
motely operated robotic capabilities.

Appendix B:

System Integration Plan for the Hubble Robotic Servicing

and De-orbit Mission (HRSDM)

HRSDM is truly a large system to design, develop, integrate, test and verify, with-
in a 39-month start to launch period of performance. This was accommodated during
selection  of  architecture  through  an  approach  that  focuses  on  a  modular,  relatively
independent, implementation. This includes:

• Stand alone De-orbit Module based on a proven spacecraft.
• Existing Robot System with International Space Station heritage.
• New  GSFC  developed  Ejection  Module  with  high  commonality  with  De-orbit

Module spacecraft bus architecture.

• An evolving Ground Station made up of existing HST ground equipment aug-
mented  with  equipment  used  during  HRSDM  elements  integration  and  test
program.

• Existing  HST  science  replacement  hardware  ready  for  incorporation  into  the

Hubble Space Telescope.

The  implementation  approach  described  above  has  three  major  features  that  will
facilitate  System  I&T.  First,  each  of  the  major  program  elements  will  be  independ-
ently  integrated,  tested  and  verified  against  their  respective  requirements.  During
that  integration  and  test  process,  simulators  from  the  interfacing  elements  will  be
used for interface validation.

Second,  a  full  up  System  Integration  and  Test  Program  of  all  of  the  elements  at
GSFC starting January 2007 one year prior to launch, will validate all system inter-
faces and complete Element Level environmental test.

Third,  all  of  the  Element  Level  ground  station  hardware  and  software  that  will
be  used  to  test  the  various  elements  at  their  developer’s  facilities,  will  be  delivered
to  GSFC  for  final  HRSDM  Level  Integration  and  Test  and  will  remain  at  the  Mis-
sion  Operations  Control  Center  through  the  Servicing  Mission,  as  applicable,
through the eventual De-orbit Mission.

The  GSFC  existing  facilities,  the  just-in-time  deliveries  of  the  HRSDM  elements,
and  the  preliminary  System  Level  integration  during  Element  I&T  are  major  con-
tributing  factors  of  a  rigorous,  albeit  short,  implementation  program.  However,  the
principal contribution is the use of existing personnel experienced on four prior serv-
icing  missions  who  have  demonstrated  their  ability  to  meet  launch  dates  without
compromising mission integrity. Building of EM in-house allows the personnel to get
involved  early  throughout  the  EM  I&T  program.  As  Robotic  System  hardware,  EM
spacecraft,  and  HST  payloads  become  available,  they  will  be  interfaced  and  tested
along with their appropriate ground stations. This enables a team to start into Sys-
tem Level I&T during EM testing from September 2006 through January 2007. Dur-
ing  the  February  2007  through  May  2007  as  the  other  elements  are  delivered,  this
experienced team will integrate the elements into the Mission System.

This still leaves six full months for System Level testing, mission simulations and

requirements verifications, before delivery of the mission to KSC for launch.

Throughout  the  mission  the  same  trained  and  experienced  work  force  will  man
the  Ground  Stations,  operate  the  HRSDM  Elements,  service  the  HST  and  de-orbit
the Ejection Module spacecraft.

STATEMENT OF DR. COLIN A. NORMAN, PROFESSOR OF

PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
Dr.  NORMAN.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,

thank you for your invitation to appear before you today.

There  have  been  many  striking  moments  during  the  Hubble
project,  times  of  tragedy  associated  with  the  Challenger  and  Co-
lumbia, character building times during the discovery of the spher-
ical  aberration  of  the  mirror,  and  then  the  correction,  in  the  flaw-
less first servicing mission.

There  have  been  times  of  great  discovery  that  have  inspired  us
all: the precise establishment of the expansion rate of the universe,
the determination of the age of the universe, a deep understanding
of the origin and evolution of galaxies, basic discoveries concerning
the  evolution  of  stars,  and  the  existence  of  massive  black  holes  at
the center of most galaxies. Indeed, Hubble discoveries have rewrit-
ten the textbooks from which our children learn.

Each  of  the  previous  servicing  missions  has  renewed  HST  and
added  significant  new  capabilities  to  the  Hubble  mission.  The
planned  SM-4  servicing  mission  would  be  no  exception.  The  sci-
entific output of discoveries coming from Hubble has been remark-
able  over  the  last  15  years.  There  is  no  doubt  that  this  great  sci-
entific  data  stream  will  continue  as  long  as  the  Hubble  mission
itself continues.

There are three options for continuing the Hubble servicing mis-
sion. Option one, a manned servicing mission, which NASA is very
experienced at executing, and which would be carried out with bril-
liance  and  precision  by  the  astronauts  as  they  have  done  for  other
servicing  missions.  Option  two,  a  robotic  servicing  mission  that
would  advance  important  technology  that  would  be  extremely  use-
ful for future exploration missions of the solar system. Brilliant en-
gineers  are  working  on  this.  Option  three,  a  free-flyer  mission,  to
be launched on a rocket, that would rehost the COS and WFC3 in-
struments on a new telescope, and would add a very new wide field
imager  that  would  be  provided  by  an  international  collaboration
with Japan. This new Hubble observatory would be a low risk, with
a  highly  optimized  scientific  return.  The  very  wide  field  imager,
with its one quarter of a billion pixels, would have a revolutionary
impact on Hubble’s science.

I  will  now  discuss  this  new  telescope  option  in  more  detail.  Al-
most a year ago, we approached NASA with the idea of a free-flyer

option  for  hosting  the  COS  and  WFC3  instruments  on  a  new  tele-
scope.  This  is  essentially  what  we  call  the  new  car  option,  with
state  of  the  art  technology.  We  have  an  experienced  team,  includ-
ing  four  current  NASA  principal  investigators.  We  have  developed
this study using the basic keep-it-simple principle. The Hubble Ori-
gins  Probe  concept  is  to  replicate  the  design  of  the  Hubble  Space
Telescope  with  a  much  lighter,  unaberrated  mirror  and  associated
lightweight  optical  telescope,  and  a  modern  spacecraft,  enabling  a
rapid  path  to  launch,  significant  cost  savings,  and  risk  mitigation.
Launch  would  be  on  an  Atlas  521  rocket.  The  very  wide  field
imager,  VWFI,  will  be  built  in  collaboration  with  our  Japanese
international  partners.  The  cost  will  be  borne  by  Japan.  The  sci-
entific  enhancement  of  the  mission  comes  from  the  fact  that  the
field  of  view  of  the  very  wide  field  imager  is  17  times  that  of  the
Advanced  Camera  currently  flying  on  Hubble,  so  we  can  map  the
heavens 17 times faster.

The  conservative  estimate  of  the  cost  of  the  HOP  project  is  ap-
proximately $1 billion, which is consistent with The Aerospace Cor-
poration  estimate  for  the  project  development  up  to  launch.  The
groundbreaking  science,  the  cutting  edge  technology  generated  in
the  development  of  new  instrumentation,  the  ability  of  Hubble
science  to  engage  the  interest  of  the  public,  and  its  impact  on  the
imagination of students, makes it worthwhile to invest this sum of
public  funds  to  complete  the  last  chapter  of  Hubble’s  remarkable
legacy.

We  have  developed  a  detailed  schedule  for  HOP  and  reasonably
estimate that from the time of the authority to proceed, it will take
65  months  to  a  successful  launch.  There  are  three  points  that  I
would  like  to  summarize  in  closing.  Point  one,  the  great  flow  of
science from the Hubble Space Telescope will continue unabated, as
long  as  it  can  be  serviced,  either  by  manned  or  robotic  missions,
or  continued  by  a  new  free-flyer  mission.  Point  two,  the  low  risk
rehost free-flyer Hubble Origins Probe mission that I have outlined
will  also  continue  the  great  Hubble  science  program  with  its  state
of  the  art  technology.  With  the  inclusion  of  the  very  wide  field
imager,  the  scientific  capabilities  would  be  very  greatly  enhanced,
and qualitatively new science can be done in some of the most im-
portant  areas  of  physics  and  astronomy.  Point  three,  HOP  can  ad-
dress  three  of  the  most  central  intellectual  issues  of  our  age,  the
nature  of  dark  energy,  the  nature  and  distribution  of  dark  matter,
and  the  prevalence  of  planets,  including  Earths,  around  other
stars.

At the beginning, I mentioned remarkable Hubble moments. This
is  another  such  moment.  It  is  time  to  decide  whether  to  proceed
with  the  Hubble  science  mission  with  any  of  the  three  options  be-
fore us. The decision is obvious. We must continue with the Hubble
adventure  to  explore  these  great  questions  further,  to  understand
more  fully  our  remarkable  universe  and  our  place  in  it.  We  must
do  this  with  intense  determination  and  energy  and  thus  continue
to  inspire  new  generations  with  the  wonder  and  thrill  of  explo-
ration and discovery.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF COLIN A. NORMAN

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to ap-

pear before you today.

There  have  been  many  striking  moments  during  the  Hubble  mission.  There  have
been dark times that overshadowed us all; namely, the tragedy of Challenger during
the pre-launch era of HST, and then more recently the Columbia tragedy.

There have been character-building times during the discovery of the spherical ab-
erration  of  the  mirror  and  then  the  correction  of  this  problem  carried  out  in  the
flawless First Servicing Mission.

Then, during the last 15 years, there have been the times of great discovery that
have  inspired  us  all.  The  precise  establishment  of  the  expansion  rate  of  the  Uni-
verse  (the  so-called  Hubble  constant),  the  determination  of  the  age  of  the  universe,
a  deep  understanding  of  the  origin  and  evolution  of  galaxies,  basic  discoveries  con-
cerning  the  origin  and  evolution  of  stars,  and  the  existence  of  massive  black  holes
at  the  centers  of  most  galaxies.  Indeed,  Hubble  discoveries  have  rewritten  the  text
books from which our children learn.

Now,  in  the  21st  Century,  astrophysics  has  assumed  a  vital  role  at  the  heart  of
physics itself and Hubble has a major role to play. The universe will be the labora-
tory in which our fundamental understanding of the laws of physics in the most ex-
treme  conditions  is  tested,  and  Hubble  is  already  making  a  major  contribution  to
this understanding.

We  now  know  that  ordinary  matter  and  light  constitute  only  a  small  fraction  (a
few percent) of the mass and energy content of the Universe. The rest is called dark
matter and dark energy. Dark energy may be associated with the cosmological con-
stant  introduced  by  Einstein.  We  know  very  little  about  these  major  components  of
our Universe. Hubble is essential to making progress in exploring the nature of the
dark matter and dark energy.

Each  of  the  previous  servicing  missions  has  renewed  HST  and  added  significant
new  capabilities  to  the  Hubble  Mission.  The  planned  Fourth  Servicing  Mission
would be no exception.

The  two  new  science  instruments  scheduled  for  the  Fourth  Servicing  Mission  are
the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide-Field Camera 3. The Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph  (COS)  will  enable  highly  significant  studies  of  the  diffuse  component
of  the  Universe  from  which  all  stars  and  galaxies  were  made.  At  least  half  of  the
ordinary  matter  in  the  Universe  may  be  identified  for  the  first  time  using  this  in-
strument  with  its  powerful  spectroscopic  capability.  Wide-Field  Camera  3  (WFC3)
has greatly enhanced power for discovery in the blue and the red region of the spec-
trum and will significantly enhance studies of galaxies and stars. Its infrared capa-
bility is essential to studies of dark energy.

The scientific output of discoveries coming from Hubble has been remarkable over
the  last  15  years.  There  is  no  doubt  that  this  great  scientific  data  stream  will  con-
tinue  as  long  as  the  Hubble  mission  itself  continues.  In  addition,  there  has  been
very significant technical spin-off into industry in the areas of precision engineering,
CCD  development,  systems  engineering,  large-scale  software  development  and
image processing, and state-of-the-art optical technology.

There are three options for continuing the Hubble science mission:

(1) A  manned  servicing  mission  which  NASA  is  very  experienced  at  executing
and  which  would  be  carried  out  with  brilliance  and  precision  by  the  astro-
nauts as they have done for the other servicing missions. The issues of safe-
ty have been reviewed extensively since the Columbia accident and my team
cannot add more to that debate.

(2) A  robotic  servicing  mission  that  would  advance  important  technology  that
would  be  extremely  useful  for  future  exploration  missions  of  the  solar  sys-
tem.  The  technical  feasibility  of  a  robotics  mission  has  been  addressed  by
the  recent  Academy  study.  However,  it  is  important  to  mention  that  out-
standing scientific and engineering efforts are being made at Goddard Space
Flight Center and elsewhere to achieve this goal.

(3) A  free-flyer  mission  to  be  launched  on  a  rocket  that  would  rehost  the  COS
and WFC3 instruments on a new telescope and would add a new Very Wide-
Field  Imager  that  would  be  provided  by  an  international  collaboration  with
Japan.  This  new  Hubble  Observatory  would  be  a  low-risk  mission  with  a
highly optimized scientific return. The Very Wide-Field Imager with its one
quarter  of  a  billion  pixels  would  have  a  revolutionary  impact  on  Hubble
science.

I will now discuss this new telescope option in more detail.

Almost  a  year  ago  we  approached  NASA  with  the  idea  of  a  free-flyer  option  for
hosting  the  COS  and  WFC3  instruments  on  a  new  telescope.  This  is  essentially
what  we  call  the  ‘‘new  car’’  option  with  state-of-the-art  technology.  We  successfully
proposed  for  NASA’s  Origins  Probes  studies  program  and  have  been  pursuing  this
NASA-funded study since that time.

We  have  an  experienced  team  including  four  current  NASA  Principal  Investiga-
tors. We have developed the study for what we call the Hubble Origins Probe (HOP)
using the basic KISS (keep-it-simple) principle. The HOP concept is to replicate the
design of the Hubble Space Telescope with a much lighter, unaberrated mirror and
associated  lightweight  optical  telescope  and  a  modern  spacecraft  enabling  a  rapid
path  to  launch,  significant  cost  savings  and  risk  mitigation.  Launch  into  low-Earth
orbit  would  be  on  an  Atlas  521  rocket.  A  general  summary  of  the  Hubble  Origins
Probe  Mission  is  given  in  Appendix  1.  Because  of  the  fast-track  schedule  for  HOP,
it would have to start the line of these Origins (or Universe) Probes.

HOP  will  fly  the  instruments  originally  planned  for  the  fourth  servicing  mission,
namely COS and WFC3, as well as a new, very-wide-field imager that will very sig-
nificantly enhance the original science mission of Hubble.

The  very  wide-field  imager  (VWFI)  will  be  built  in  collaboration  with  our  Japa-
nese international partners. The cost will be borne by Japan. The scientific enhance-
ment  of  the  mission  comes  from  the  fact  that  the  field  of  view  of  the  VWFI  is  17
times that of the Advanced Camera currently flying on Hubble and the VWFI is 3–
4  times  more  sensitive  at  critical  wavelengths.  This  means  that  we  can  map  the
heavens more than 20 times faster.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Japanese  camera  will  be  provided  for  the  use  of
the  entire  astronomical  community  and  that,  as  for  COS  and  WFC3,  time  on  this
will  be  granted  by  a  peer  review  system  that  is  based  on  the  merit  of  the  proposal
as is normal with Hubble time allocation.

Note that the empty fourth quadrant in the field of view could host an additional
instrument. One exciting possibility, which we have been discussing with our Euro-
pean and Australian collaborators, is an integral field spectrograph that could make
excellent  progress  in  studying  super  massive  black  holes  at  the  center  of  galaxies.
The  conservative  estimate  of  the  cost  of  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe  project  is  ap-
proximately $1 Billion, which is consistent with the Aerospace Corporation estimate
for  the  project  development  up  to  launch.  This  is  discussed  further  in  Appendix  2.
The  ground-breaking  science,  the  cutting-edge  technology  generated  in  the  develop-
ment  of  new  instrumentation,  the  ability  of  Hubble  science  to  engage  the  interest
of the public, and its impact on the imagination of students, make it worthwhile to
invest this sum of public funds to complete the last chapter of Hubble’s remarkable
legacy. Now, $1 billion is a great deal of money in this time of large budget deficits,
but that is what this type of space science mission costs. We argue that the Hubble
Mission  is  a  national  treasure  that  both  requires  and  is  worthy  of  the  investment
of this level of government resources. We believe that the intellectual legacy of HOP
would  be  invaluable.  The  investment  of  $1  billion  in  leading  edge  technology,  the
launch of a state-of-the-art observatory and the excitement that comes with renewed
exploration of our universe will ripple out over industry, NASA centers, universities,
and grade schools as the components are designed, built and flown and new secrets
of  the  universe  are  revealed.  HOP  will  inspire  and  motivate  young  scientists  and
engineers,  helping  seed  America  with  the  human  capital  so  vital  for  the  long-term
strength  of  our  high-tech  economy.  For  these  reasons  it  is  important  to  maintain
and  strengthen  the  partnership  between  academia  and  government  that  has  been
so vital to our exploration of space.

We  have  developed  a  detailed  schedule  for  HOP  and  reasonably  estimate  that
from  the  time  of  the  authority  to  proceed  it  will  take  65  months  to  a  successful
launch.  This  is  faster  than  the  Aerospace  Corporation  estimate  of  100  months,  but
our  team  has  in-depth  experience  and  after  an  extensive  analysis  of  the  schedule
we have concluded that the 65 months estimate is reasonable. This is discussed fur-
ther in Appendices 3 and 4. We believe launching HOP near the end of this decade
is feasible and of the utmost importance. We are motivated by our sense that great
discoveries  on  the  nature  of  the  dark  matter,  dark  energy  and  planetary  systems
around other stars are imminent and our belief that the HOP mission sits in a vital
position in the NASA roadmap, serving as an essential pathfinder to the even more
ambitious  missions  to  map  the  universe  planned  for  2015  and  beyond.  The  many
young  talented  scientists  and  engineers  currently  associated  with  Hubble  are  in
place, ready to meet the challenges and reap the challenges of HOP today. They are
a  pool  of  expertise  and  energy  which  could  dissipate  should  Hubble  science  fade  or
the gap between HOP and HST grow too long.

In  the  context  of  the  astronomical  roadmap,  our  goal  with  HOP  is  to  first  repair
the  bridge  broken  by  the  Columbia  tragedy,  and  then  drive  over  that  bridge  and

explore current territory planned on the roadmap for Hubble science. Subsequently,
using  our  newly  enhanced  capabilities,  we  can  drive  significantly  further  onwards
to explore and map quite new and interesting territories.

There are three points I would like to summarize in closing:

(1) The  great  flow  of  science  from  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  will  continue
unabated as long as it can be serviced either by manned or robotic missions
or continued by a new free-flyer mission.

(2) The  low-risk,  rehost,  free-flyer  Hubble  Origins  Probe  mission  that  I  have
outlined will also continue the great Hubble science program with its state-
of-the-art technology. With the inclusion of the Very Wide-Field Imager, the
scientific capabilities would be very greatly enhanced and qualitatively new
science can be done in some of the most important areas of physics and as-
tronomy.

(3) These Hubble-related science questions that I have been discussing, includ-
ing  the  dark  matter  and  dark  energy  that  constitute  most  of  the  Universe,
the nature of black holes, and the nature and discovery of planetary systems
around  other  stars,  are  the  subject  of  intense  study  by  astronomers  and
physicists.  Clearly  though,  these  topics  are  now  not  merely  in  a  specialized
domain for astronomers only. With HOP we can address three of these most
central intellectual issues of our age: the nature of dark energy, the nature
and  distribution  of  dark  matter  and  the  prevalence  of  planets,  including
earths, around other stars.

At  the  beginning  of  my  talk  I  mentioned  striking  moments  during  the  Hubble
mission. This is another such moment. The moment now has come to decide wheth-
er  to  proceed  with  the  Hubble  science  mission  with  any  of  the  three  options  before
us.

The  decision  is  obvious.  We  must  continue  with  the  Hubble  adventure  to  explore
these  great  questions  further,  to  understand  more  fully  our  remarkable  Universe
and  our  place  in  it.  We  must  do  this  with  intense  determination  and  energy  and
thus  continue  to  inspire  new  generations  with  the  wonder  and  thrill  of  exploration
and discovery.

HUBBLE ORIGINS PROBE (HOP)

Appendix 1:

1. Overview

A no-new-technology HST-class observatory with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
(COS),  the  Wide-Field  Camera  3  (WFC3)  and  the  very  wide-field-imager  (VWFI)  as
its core instruments can be launched to low-Earth orbit (LEO) on an Atlas 521 dur-
ing  2010  with  a  cost  of  $1  billion.  Using  technology  developed  and  perfected  since
HST was built 25 years ago, we can construct the Hubble Origins Probe (HOP) with
a much lighter unaberrated mirror and OTA than those in HST, significantly reduc-
ing  cost.  The  HOP  mission  will  be  uniquely  well  suited  to  the  study  of  the  modern
universe over the epoch where the majority of star and planet formation, heavy ele-
ment production, black hole growth, and final galaxy assembly took place. COS/HOP
will  reach  two  magnitudes  deeper  than  HST/STIS  enabling  a  broad,  deep  science
program:  from  the  physics  of  massive  star  formation  in  local  group  galaxies  to  the
atmospheres  of  giant  planets.  With  a  ∼100-fold  increase  in  the  number  of  back-
ground  quasars  available  for  absorption  studies,  COS/HOP  will  revolutionize  our
study  of  the  intergalactic  medium.  WFC3/HOP  provides  a  ∼10-fold  increase  in  dis-
covery power in the Near Infrared (NIR), and a ∼100-fold increase in the ultraviolet
(UV),  enabling  new  areas  of  survey  science,  and  addressing  fundamental  questions
about  the  origin  and  evolution  of  galaxies,  black  holes,  and  planets.  With  its  capa-
bilities focused on high resolution imaging in the ultraviolet and optical parts of the
spectrum, HOP will be a critical complement to NASA’s Spitzer and JWST missions
in the quest to understand our origins and our universe.

As  a  new  state-of-the-art  mission,  HOP  provides  unique  opportunities  to  extend
the  discovery  space  provided  by  COS  and  WFC3  on  Hubble.  We  will  turn  the  re-
quirement to replace the aberration-correction optics in COS and WFC3 into an op-
portunity to extend the wavelength range of the COS down to 110 nm, enabling crit-
ical  new  science.  Our  Japanese  partners  are  leading  the  development  of  a  high
throughput,  Very  Wide-Field  Imager  (VWFI)  that  achieves  a  field  of  view  approxi-
mately 17 times larger than the current Advanced Camera for surveys (ACS) by til-
ing one half of the unaberrated focal plane with CCDs. We have a novel optical solu-
tion  for  correcting  the  astigmatism  and  field  curvature  in  the  HST-like  wide-field
of view Ritchey-Chre´tien design and are prototyping high throughput Hammamatsu
CCDs.  High-resolution  high-throughput  multi-color  very  wide-field  imaging  from
space with HOP/VWFI would enable unprecedented studies of: the origins of galaxy
morphology;  the  nature  of  dark  energy  through  an  efficient  search  for  distant  type
Ia  SNe;  the  distribution  of  dark  matter  and  measurement  of  cosmological  param-
eters with weak gravitational lensing; the census of thousands of planetary transits
per year and, via microlensing, detection of Earth-like planets.
2. Engineering and Technical

We  have  studied  the  feasibility  of  developing  and  launching  the  HOP  in  2010  to
assure the continuity of Hubble science. The approach uses the simplest and lowest
risk  concept—a  dedicated  free-flyer  mission  carrying  COS,  WFC3  and  VWFI.  Cost
and  risk  are  minimized  by  use  of  existing  inventory  of  satellite  components  and
ground  systems  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  The  mission  is  not  constrained  to
reach Hubble before its demise and no Shuttle launch is required.

To  preclude  complete  redesign  of  the  WFC3,  the  first  order  optical  parameters  of
the optical telescope (OTA) must match those of the HST. The Science Instruments
(SI) interface will be identical to that of HST. We include three Fine Guidance Sys-
tems  (FGS)  for  fine  guidance  control  in  the  core  complement.  The  HOP  will  use  a
modern  spacecraft  with  Spitzer  heritage  and  will  be  launched  into  a  28.5  degree
∼700  km  circular  orbit  by  an  Atlas  521.  The  spacecraft  provides  the  functions  of
HST power, data handling, pointing, and communications based on SIRTF heritage.
A de-orbit module based on TDRSS heritage is added. HST-quality pointing and jit-
ter  control  is  achieved  using  the  HST  approach  with  one  HST  FGS  and  two  new
simpler FGS’s that use modern technology. A key design issue is mass reduction to
control  cost  and  complexity.  The  mass  of  the  OTA  plus  SIs  is  reduced  by  nearly  50
percent from HST. The necessary de-orbit module is a simple low-cost two-tank de-
sign. See Figures 1–3.
3. Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and Wide-field Camera 3 (WFC3)

The  COS  gratings  will  be  replaced  because  the  telescope  image  will  be
unaberrated. This opportunity will be used to shift the short wavelength cutoff from

94

1150 A˚ to 1100 A˚ . By shifting to a shorter wavelength, significant advances in inter-
galactic medium studies will be possible.

No major modifications of WFC3 are anticipated in the baseline mission. The pri-
mary  changes  will  be  the  replacement  of  a  few  components  in  the  optical  train  to
correct for the unaberrated image of the HOP telescope. No filter changes have been
base-lined.
4. Very Wide-Field Imager (VWFI)

The nature of dark energy, the nature and large-scale distribution of dark matter
and  the  demographics  of  extra-solar  planets  are  outstanding  problems  for  twenty
first  century  science.  Solving  these  problems  requires  ultra-stable,  wide-field,  dif-
fraction limited imaging in the optical and near infrared. The HOP Very Wide-Field
Imager  (VWFI)  is  specifically  designed  to  attack  these  and  other  important  origins
questions.  The  VWFI  is  a  camera  that  will  be  contributed  by  Japan.  The  Japanese
astronomy  and  industrial  team  is  being  led  by  Dr.  Saku  Tsuneta  (National  Astro-
nomical  Observatory),  and  is  drawing  on  Japan’s  deep  reservoir  of  experience  in
building instruments for space astronomy and ultra wide-field imagers and spectro-
graphs for the Subaru 8m telescope.
Hamamatsu 2K × 2K CCDs is advancing very quickly. See Figure 4.

The  Japanese  design  to  ‘‘pave’’  one  half  of  HOP’s  unaberrated  focal  plane  with

The  VWFI  will  have  a  survey  capability  17  times  greater  than  the  current  Ad-

vanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) at all wavelengths.

We  will  use  this  powerful  new  capability  to  detect  thousands  of  transits  by  plan-
ets  in  the  bulge  stars,  opening  an  exciting  era  of  planetary  demographics,  survey
for hundreds of high-z Type Ia supernovae to investigate the nature of dark energy,
and to make large area weak lensing surveys to measure the large scale distribution
of dark matter. See Figures 5–7.

HOP SCHEDULE

Appendix 4:

COMPARISON WITH AEROSPACE REPORT

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Analyses of Alternatives (AoA) Aero-
space Report identified $2B life cycle cost (including costs for government oversight,
mission  operations  and  the  cost  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  de-orbit  module)  for
the  low-Earth  orbit  (LEO)  free-flyer  mission  to  rehost  the  HST  instruments  COS
and WFC3. This mission is equivalent to the HOP.

The HOP project cost is approximately $1B ($991M) which includes only space ve-
hicle  development  costs  (Phases  B,  C  &  D)  over  a  65-month  development  span.
Thus,  the  difference  between  the  Aerospace  ($2B)  and  HOP  ($1B)  costs  represent
inclusion of different portions of very similar project cost estimates.

There  are  three  significant  differences  between  the  Aerospace  and  HOP  values.

These differences are delineated in Table 1.

1) A  major  difference  is  that  Aerospace  developed  total  life  cycle  cost,  whereas
the  presented  HOP  cost  represents  only  project  cost.  Mission  operations
($300M)  and  government  oversight  ($200M)  costs  are  not  included  in  the
HOP project cost, but are appropriately included in total life cycle costs. This
accounts for approximately $500M (50 percent of the difference). Mission op-
erations costs should be the same for HOP as for a refurbished Hubble Space
Telescope.

2) The  second  difference  is  that  the  Aerospace  rehost  mission  cost  includes
costs  for  a  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  de-orbit  only  mission  ($400M)  to
provide safe HST disposal at the end of its science mission. This work would
not  be  managed  by  the  HOP  project  office,  and  thus  is  not  included  in  the
HOP  project  cost.  This  accounts  for  approximately  40  percent  of  the  dif-
ference.  The  HOP  design  (and  project  cost)  does  include  a  HOP  integrated
de-orbit propulsion and control system that will safely dispose of HOP at the
end of its science mission.

3) The third difference is that the Aerospace estimate was developed assuming
a 100-month space vehicle development schedule, whereas the HOP estimate
was  based  upon  a  65-month  development  span.  This  accounts  for  approxi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

96

mately  $100M  (10  percent  of  the  difference).  This  number  was  derived  as-
suming  a  program  loading  of  135  EP  at  $250K  cost  per  person  per  year  for
35 months.

When  compared  on  a  project  cost  basis,  both  the  Aerospace  report  and  the  HOP
costs result in equivalent project costs of approximately $1B (including a 30 percent
contingency).

Note that although neither the Aerospace report nor the HOP costs include devel-
opment costs for the proposed very wide-field imager (VWFI), HOP costs and sched-
ules  do  include  space  vehicle  systems  engineering  and  integration  associated  with
the VWFI.

With  regard  to  the  100-month  Aerospace  and  65-month  HOP  development  sched-
ule  estimates,  the  HOP  project  office  plans  to  execute  an  efficient  65-month  space
vehicle development span as possible, while still including appropriate schedule con-
tingency for all major activities. This schedule minimizes any gap between HST and
HOP and also avoids marching army costs associated with an extended development
span. In the specific case of HOP a 65-month (5c  years) development span for HOP
is  reasonable  because  space  vehicle  design,  integration  and  CONOPS  are  being  re-
used from the highly successful HST.

Besides having achievable 12-month spans between ATP and system PDR as well
as  between  system  PDR  and  system  CDR,  HOP’s  65-month  development  span  in-
cludes  serial,  completely  independent  and  fully  funded  schedule  reserves  at  the  fol-
lowing  levels:  six  months  of  schedule  reserve  in  the  VWFI  development  (program
critical path); four months of OTA development schedule reserve; three months each
of COS and WFC3 development reserve; three months of spacecraft assembly sched-
ule reserve and four months of system-level schedule reserve between the end of en-
vironmental test and shipment to the launch base.

In  summary,  the  difference  between  the  Aerospace  and  HOP  cost  presentations
are primarily a matter of scope. The Aerospace Report’s $2B life cycle cost includes
costs  for  government  oversight,  mission  operations  (Phase  E)  and  the  $400M  cost
of the Hubble Space Telescope de-orbit module which are appropriately not included
in the $1B HOP project cost.

The  Aerospace  Report’s  100-month  schedule  is  significantly  conservative  and  ap-
propriate  were  HOP  an  entirely  new  mission  being  constructed  ab  initio.  However,
the proposed HOP is deliberately designed to allowed streamlined development. The
HOP  baseline  65-month  (5c  year)  integrated  master  schedule  has  reasonable,  12-
month spans between system design reviews, adequate instrument modification and
VWFI  development  spans,  as  well  as  serial  and  fully  funded  schedule  reserve  for
each significant activity in addition to four months of system-level schedule reserve.

BIOGRAPHY FOR COLIN A. NORMAN

Colin  Norman  is  Professor  of  Physics  and  Astronomy  at  The  Johns  Hopkins  Uni-
versity and Astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute. He works on both
theoretical  and  observational  astrophysics  in  areas  including:  the  formation,  struc-
ture, and evolution of galaxies; the physics of active galaxies, quasars, and starburst
galaxies;  the  structure  of  the  intergalactic  medium  and  the  interstellar  medium;
and, star formation.

He  was  an  undergraduate  at  the  University  of  Melbourne,  Australia,  a  graduate
student  in  Theoretical  Physics  at  Oxford  as  a  Rhodes  Scholar,  and  then  elected  as
a  Fellow  of  Magdalen  College,  Oxford.  After  his  postdoctoral  work  at  UC–Berkeley
as a Miller Fellow, Dr. Norman joined the faculty at Leiden University as an Assist-
ant  Professor  in  1978.  In  the  next  six  years  he  held,  in  addition,  appointments  at
the  Institute  of  Astronomy,  Cambridge,  the  University  of  Paris  and  the  European
Southern  Observatory.  In  1984,  he  moved  to  his  current  post  in  Baltimore.  From
1988 through 1994 he was Head of the Academic Affairs Division at the Space Tele-
scope  Science  Institute.  He  frequently  visits  the  European  Southern  Observatory
where  the  optical  work  for  this  project  was  done  using  the  eight-meter  telescope  at
the  VLT.  He  is  currently  proposing  to  create  a  new  Astrophysics  Institute  at  the
Johns Hopkins University.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Spoken  like  a  true  advocate.  Thank  you

very much, Dr. Norman.

The Chair now is pleased to recognize the Chairman of the Sub-

committee on Space and Aeronautics, Mr. Calvert.

WEBB VERSUS HUBBLE

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the cour-
tesy  to  start  early.  Dr.  Taylor,  NASA  is  developing,  as  you  have
mentioned  in  your  testimony,  a  new,  larger  telescope,  the  James
Webb Space Telescope, which is, as you know, scheduled to launch
in 2011.

How  do  the  capabilities  of  this  Webb  telescope  compare  to  what
we would get from the Hubble if it was serviced, or for that matter,
the rehosting option that Dr. Norman advocates?

Dr.  TAYLOR.  All  right.  The  Hubble  telescope  is,  of  course,  a  2.4
meter telescope. The James Webb telescope is six meters in diame-
ter,  a  very  much  larger  collecting  area.  The  James  Webb  telescope
is  optimized  for  use  in  the  infrared  part  of  the  spectrum,  the  near
infrared,  and  the  wavelength  region  is—overlaps,  but  only  a  small
amount,  so  the  differences  are  substantial,  and  as  I  attempted  to
point  out,  the  judgment  of  the  Survey  Committee,  when  this  was
done, was that pushing into this new wavelength region from space
would be extraordinarily beneficial scientifically.

I don’t want, at all, to downplay the highly desirable, very impor-
tant  science  that  will  still  be  accomplishable  by  a  refurbished
Hubble telescope.

Mr. CALVERT. In that vein, how disruptive would it be to science
and  to  the  astronomers,  and  the—your  opinion,  and  the  opinion  of
your  committee,  if  the  Hubble  was  to  cease  operation  before  the
James Webb telescope is launched?

Dr.  TAYLOR.  The  best,  by  far,  would  be  to  have  both,  but  it  was
always  understood  that  the  Hubble’s  time  would  end  at  about  the
time  that  the  James  Webb  telescope  became  available,  so  simulta-
neous  observations  were  never  thought  to  be  a  likelihood.  Keeping
the Hubble going until that time would still be very desirable.

COST AND SCHEDULE OF A ROBOTIC SERVICING MISSION

102

Mr.  CALVERT.  Mr.  Pulliam,  Dr.  Lanzerotti,  in  the  testimony,  Dr.
Cooper stated that he believes that The Aerospace Corporation, Na-
tional  Academy  reports  were  overly  pessimistic,  and  overstate  the
costs of—risks of a robotic servicing mission. And he seems to make
a strong argument—I was—I am also on the Armed Services Com-
mittee.  I  am  compelled  by  the  DOD  portion  of  that,  of  servicing
somewhere  down  the  road,  but  in  your  opinion,  both  Mr.  Pulliam
and  Dr.  Lanzerotti,  do  you  believe  it  is  possible  that  NASA  could
meet the costs and schedule that Dr. Cooper laid out?

Mr.  PULLIAM.  Mr.  Calvert,  let  me  begin.  I  think  it  is  important
when  we  talk  about  cost,  to  make  sure  we  understand  what  terms
we  are  using.  As  I  said  in  my  prefatory  remarks,  the  Aerospace
analysis  of  alternatives  was  just  that.  It  was  not  an  assessment  of
any  individual  program.  It  specifically  was  excluded  from  our  task
list  from  NASA.  It  was  an  analytical  survey.  But  that  is  not  just
throwing  a  dart  against  a  dartboard.  Our  analytical  results  came
from  a  database  which  has  results  of  hundreds  of  systems  and
thousands  of  subsystems  on  how  they  really  came  out,  not  what
was advertised at the beginning.

So,  in  the  process  of  coming  up  with  these  cost  estimates  for
these various missions, we did rely on all the data that is available
with  regard  to  cost  and  schedule.  With  regard  to  how  our  costs
were put together, through the issue of the $2 billion for rehosting,
say,  versus  a  $1  billion  cost,  again,  it  is  important  to  realize  that
the Aerospace models are all our life cycle costs. So, that means in-
cluded  in  those  costs  are  not  only  the  costs  of  building  the  instru-
ments, and the costs of building the spacecraft vehicle, but also in-
cluded in our numbers are $300 million or so of operations over the
course of the years that that module would be attached to Hubble,
or  that  a  new  instrument  would  be  in  space.  Launch  vehicle  costs
are included in our costs. I haven’t heard anybody talk about that.
And  in  all  our  missions,  we  also  include  a  de-orbit  possibility  for
Hubble, which the minimum cost for that is about $300 million, so
that must be added. Additionally, we baseline the Goddard system,
as  they  are  presently  developing  it,  in  terms  of  the  kind  of  capa-
bility.  So,  when  you  look  at  life  cycle  costs,  and  begin  to  take  out
of  that  the  elements  that  might  not  be  in  someone  else’s  estimate,
you  get  closer  on  the  numbers,  and  again,  realizing  that  our  num-
bers are analytical.

Any  program  that  looks  at  the  results  of  how  a  program  might
be cost, or might come in on schedule, certainly, the elements that
comprise  that  are  in  a  bell  curve.  If  certainly  someone  is  going  to
come in under cost and under schedule, but I must say, we see that
far  less  frequently  than  we  see  folks  who  do  find  technical  chal-
lenges,  and  do  find  costs  and  schedule  delays  as  they  go  through
programs. So, we believe our analysis rightfully looks at how things
have come out versus how they have started.

And  finally,  to  the  issue  of  the  grapple  arm,  of  a  contract  of—
a firm, fixed price contract that might be in the $150 million range
versus  Aerospace’s  advertisement  of  $700  million.  Well,  again,  our
costs  are  life  cycle  costs,  and  are  a  total  of  system  cost  for  that
arm, I am not privy to the contract for the MDA arm. That contract

had  not  been  awarded  when  we  completed  our  survey,  so  we  did
not look at that program at all, because ours was an analytical sur-
vey. But the arm to arm cost, in our estimate is about $285 million,
versus about $150 million. The remainder of our cost, and the $700
million,  are  for  things  like  interface  with  the  spacecraft,  increased
mass,  increased  power,  software,  all  the  things  that  we  know  hap-
pen  when  you  hook  up  something  like  an  arm  to  a  spacecraft  in
a way that has not been done before.

I  congratulate  the  gentleman  on  the  use  of  the  arm,  but  oper-
ating  it  on  the  Shuttle  is,  in  our  opinion,  different  than  mating  it
up to a new spacecraft also in development. With regard to the arm
being  delivered  at  the  31  month  period,  versus  our  estimate  of  64
months, we frankly didn’t find the delivery of the arm to be on the
critical  path  of  the  66  months.  It  is  the  development  of  the  inter-
faces and the entire system, and getting the spacecraft ready to go
with  an  arm  that  drove  our  estimate.  So,  that  is  how  we  came  to
our conclusions.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you.  My  time  has  expired,  but  Doctor,

would you have any further comment on that?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  If  I  have  a  moment,  I  would  like  to  refer—we
had  a  subcommittee,  chaired  by  Mr.  Rothenberg,  who  looked  at
the—who did many, many visits to look at the robotic development,
and  I  would  like  to  ask  him,  if  I  might,  to  make  some  comments
related to your question.

Mr. CALVERT. The Chairman.
Mr.  ROTHENBERG.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity.  Number  one,
I  can’t  commend  MDA  more  for  the  performance  of  their  robotics
to  date.  The  Space  Shuttle  and  Space  Station.  And  the  robot  was
never the issue. We did know from the beginning that that is what
the  project  was  baselining.  However,  I  would  point  out  that  even
in the Space Shuttle, after nine years of flying it, we were still fine-
tuning algorithms when we released the Hubble. As General Bold-
en would remember, there were differences with a mass—vehicle of
that mass that needed some fine-tuning of the algorithms on orbit.
In fact, with the Space Station, we had a few problems up front in
the initial deployment of the robotic arm that is up there today.

The  second  point  I  want  to  make  is,  the  XSS-10,  11  experiment.
I  am  well  familiar  with  it.  They  briefed  us.  We  had  discussions
with  them,  and  indeed,  the  sensor  on  board,  the  LIDAR  sensor,
which  is  an  important  part  of  the  Hubble  mission,  performs  one
part  of  the  algorithm  processing,  one  part  of  the  sensor  detection
that feeds the algorithms for the capture of Hubble. However, that
is  a  different  vehicle.  It  is—the  technology  there  is  not  dem-
onstrating  six  degrees  of  freedom,  and  capture  on  the  translation
and rotation that are really needed for the Hubble capture, so there
is  work  once  that  demonstration  is  done,  on  orbit,  assuming  that
it is successful. We are familiar with the optic sensor, and the fact
that it is the same sensor that MDA is proposing to use for Hubble,
but there is development work.

Finally,  the  experiments  done  by  the  Russians,  they  were  gen-
erally  all  the  robotic  rendezvous  and  docking  with  Progress  vehi-
cles.  That  is  all  done  with  what  is  called  a  cooperative  vehicle,  a
vehicle that actually has detection on board of an approaching vehi-
cle,  and  closes  the  loop.  Hubble  is  not  a  cooperative  vehicle.  It

doesn’t have fiduciaries on it. A number of complications associated
with it. Finally, and finally, the other important point is given the
time  and  given  the  funding  in  ’05,  that  the  project  has,  and  the
time limits, they have not received the full funding that they really
need  to  make  the  schedule  alone,  so  they  are  starting  out  behind
the eight ball to begin with.

Given all of those points, our report did consider, I think, almost
all of the aspects, and the robot itself was not the issue. It was the
system  integration,  the  algorithm  development,  the  validation  of
the algorithms, and the testing. If I deliver the robot at 31 months,
I  only  have  eight  months  left  in  which  to  integrate  and  work  out
all  the  system  bugs  with  the  whole  rest  of  the  system.  And  to  us,
that would seem like a very unreasonable, based on our experience.
Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just—
as  a  comment,  I  certainly  am  intrigued  by  this  technology,  but  it
seems to be very complex. Obviously, we have a budgeting process,
and  we  have  a  time  problem.  And  I  certainly  look  forward  to—I
would  like  to  look  at  it  from  a  DOD  perspective,  possibly  a  dem-
onstration  project  of  some  type  on  servicing  some  of  our  DOD  sat-
ellites.  This  may  be  some  kind  of  way  to  find  some  additional  re-
sources to do something like this. But——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Calvert.  Dr.
Lanzerotti, once again, for the benefit of the recorder and the audi-
ence, would you introduce your associates for the record?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Yes.  This  was  Mr.  Joseph  Rothenberg.  I  called
on him because he was the chair of our subcommittee on the robot-
ics,  and  led  that  group.  He  is  the  former  head  of  the  NASA  God-
dard Space Flight Center. Thank you for allowing me to use my as-
sociates. They bring a certain credibility to this in specialized areas
that  I  could  express,  but  I  don’t  have  the  same  level  of  credibility
that I believe my colleagues do.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  so  much  for  introducing  him,
and it is good to see you back here. This was billed as an exchange
of  views,  and  I  am  sure  that  Dr.  Cooper  has  a  somewhat  different
view of the remarks just made, so I will impose on the Committee,
and  give  him  a  couple  of  minutes  to  respond  before  we  continue
with Mr. Gordon.

Dr. Cooper.
Dr. COOPER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and——
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Everybody  knows  that  the  people  we  have

here have unquestioned credibility.

Dr. COOPER. Absolutely.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  they  have  points  of  view.  Where,  in

your estimation, did they go wrong?

Dr. COOPER. Okay. You might characterize me at the moment as
dying  to  respond  to  these  points  that  have  just  been  raised.  I  will
start  with  the  gentleman  from  The  Aerospace  Corporation.  First,
actually,  when  I  first  looked  at  the  Aerospace  Report,  I  was  ex-
tremely pleased, because it is very important, when you try to ana-
lyze a mission like this, to compare it to things that are like it, and
that  is  the  essence  of  what  The  Aerospace  Corporation  report  did.
The thing is, if you look at the total database of all space programs,
you are looking at almost entirely clean sheet programs that start-
ed from scratch, and there is almost no programs in their database

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

105

that they compared against that were, in fact, started from the be-
ginning as running start programs, and in fact, if you do the same
kind of analysis and throw some comparables in there, such as the
development  of  the  Boeing  702  commercial  communications  sat-
ellite,  you  find  a  much  different  story  about  the  schedule,  and  in
fact, the schedule looks like 40 months if you start with a running
start,  and  you  have  a  goal  to  get  there,  it  is  not  a  problem  at  all.
So, that is my first point. The second point that was raised just mo-
ments  ago,  by  the—Mr.  Pulliam,  was  with  respect  to  what  is  in-
cluded and what is not included. And I am pleased to tell you that
in  the  budget  that  I  showed  you,  it  is  approximately  a  billion  dol-
lars, the NASA project budget. It actually includes the launch. And
with respect to what is included with the robotics system, and how
hard  is  it  to  interface  to  the  spacecraft,  et  cetera,  I  am  happy  to
tell you that the $25 million I quoted includes the avionics box that
controls  the  robot  and  interfaces  with  the  spacecraft.  So,  in  my
view,  it  is  a  question  of  what,  you  know,  what  you  compare  to
when  you  look  at  The  Aerospace  Corporation  report  and  especially
the running start story.

Now,  if  I  might,  just  a  moment,  turn  to  Mr.  Rothenberg’s  com-
ments.  Boy.  The  first  thing  I  want  to  address  is  the  XSS–11  mis-
sion.  Mr.  Rothenberg  said  correctly  that  it  doesn’t  exactly  test  ex-
actly what we are doing on the Hubble. However, it does establish
a  major  credibility  point  for  the  space  program  of  the  U.S.  This  is
an  Air  Force  mission.  In  the  core  competence  of  can  we  find  a
spacecraft,  can  we  find  it,  can  we  use  sensors  that  are  very  ad-
vanced? This LIDAR thing, it can see, basically, something the size
of half an inch from a distance of two miles. So once we have done
this  mission,  we  have  gone  a  long  way,  and  the  few  additional
pieces, such as this six degree of freedom, essentially have to detect
how  the  spacecraft  is  positioned  relative  to  you.  That  part  of  it  is
not  going  to  be  done  in  XSS–11.  However,  there  is  already  on  the
plan  what  is  called  a  DTO  mission,  to  fly  that  exact  software  very
soon. So, again, this risk will have been retired far before we actu-
ally try to launch this mission and execute it.

And  one—a  couple  more  comments.  The  funding  story,  it  is  true
if  the  program  runs  out  of  money,  the  schedule  is  going  to  length-
en.  At  the  moment,  all  of  the  components  of  this  program  have
been  running  full  blast,  that  is,  there  has  been  enough  money,  so
far, that we haven’t had any slowdowns, and I encourage the Com-
mittee, of course, to keep it that way. So, that has not been a factor
to date

And one last comment, which is I very much regret the fact that
the  Committee  didn’t  come  out  to  see  the  reality  of  Dextre  in  real
life. I wish they had. Thank you for your time.

Chairman BOEHLERT. That is an open invitation, I take it.
Dr. COOPER. Oh, absolutely.

A HUBBLE SERVICING MISSION’S EFFECT ON OTHER

SCIENCE MISSIONS

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Cooper. And let
me point out that following this hearing, we will submit some ques-
tions  in  writing  to  all  of  you.  We  would  appreciate  a  timely  re-
sponse,  and  we  will  also  welcome  from  you  sort  of  a  supplemental

statement  of—based  upon  this  hearing,  some  additional  thoughts
that you think should be brought to our attention. The ideal situa-
tion  would  be  to  have  this  back  and  forth  like  we  have  right  now.
That is where we learn the most, and that is where we get out, ex-
posed into the light of day, the varying points of view. But we don’t
have unlimited time, so we will make that opportunity available to
all  of  our  witnesses,  to  supplement,  following  this  hearing,  your
written  testimony,  and  we  will  make  certain  that  all  our  members
see that, and have the advantage of that input.

Now,  it  is  my  turn.  Dr.  Taylor,  you  know,  as  I  mentioned  at  the
outset, if the Hubble servicing was going to deprive the science pro-
grams  of  more  than  a  billion  dollars,  Dr.  Taylor  said  he  would  re-
luctantly opt for letting Hubble die. You know, and that, you know,
we  try  so  very  hard  to  say  we  don’t  have  unlimited  resources  up
here.  Give  us  your  best  guidance,  and  Dr.  Taylor,  thank  you  so
much for trying to help us get it in perspective. I would like to see
what  Dr.  Lanzerotti  and  Dr.  Beckwith  and  Dr.  Norman  have  to
say. Would you agree with that assessment?

Dr. Lanzerotti.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  I  am  not  sure  I  understand  exactly  your  ques-

tion.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, you know——
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Dr.  Taylor  tried  to  help  us,  tried  to  quan-
tify.  He  said  if  it  is  going  to  cost  more  than  a  billion  dollars,  then
maybe,  because  of  the  risk  to  other  programs,  it  is  not  worth  the
price.  If  it  is  going  to  cost  less  than  a  billion  dollars,  let  us  go  for-
ward. I mean, we are all cheerleaders for Hubble.

Dr. LANZEROTTI. Okay.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  all  stand  up  and  applaud  when  we
think  about  its  accomplishment,  but  there  comes  a  point  of  dimin-
ishing returns, based upon costs and impact on other programs.

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Well,  you  have  to  recognize  Dr.  Taylor  was  a

member of my Committee.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Sure.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  And  we  had  a  unanimous  opinion.  And  unani-
mous  conclusions.  And  our  conclusions  did  not  get  into  the  ques-
tions of the place of dying Hubble with—or a dead Hubble, with the
Decadal Survey. We took it as given that the Decadal Survey of As-
trophysics  that  was  issued  in  2000  or  2001,  Joe,  was—assumed
Hubble  Servicing  Mission  4.  So  that  the  optical  astronomy  would
be  present  to  continue—optical  astronomy  would  be  present  with
the  two  new  instruments  installed  in  Servicing  Mission  4,  so  that
that  optical  astronomy,  with  the  enormous  increase  of  capabili-
ties—in—that  the  two  new  instruments  would  allow,  would  be
present  during  this  time  prior  to  James  Webb  telescope,  so  that
there  would  be  the  new  science,  plus  the  science  that  would  be
achieved  in  the  overlap  with  the  ongoing  NASA  great  observ-
atories,  the  Chandra,  the  infrared  telescope,  and  other  missions
that are up there. And so, that was the premise that our committee
went on. We did not—our committee did not redo the Decadal Sur-
vey. We did not get into this question of——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, forget about the Committee for a mo-
ment.  If  you  will  just  as  a  scientist,  I  mean—the  basic  theme  that

he  advanced,  I  mean,  if  it  is  going  to  cost  more  than  a  billion  dol-
lars, the impact on other science programs are not worth the addi-
tional costs. He guides us in that direction. And he would say, end
it and go forward with the other programs. As a scientist——

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Okay.  As  a  scientist.  I  am  not  an  astronomer.
I  think  one  of  the  reasons  why  I  was  selected  to  chair  this  Com-
mittee was the fact that I had never used Hubble, didn’t know any-
thing about Hubble practically going into this. I have done a lot of
space  research  on  unmanned  robotic  spacecraft  throughout  the
solar  system,  and  mainly,  and  often  around  the  Earth’s  environ-
ment,  for  practical  purposes,  when  I  was  at  AT&T  and  Lucent.  As
a  scientist,  I  would  say  that  if  the  billion  dollars  were  going  to
come out of some other aspect of NASA’s science program, such as
Earth  science,  such  as  solar  terrestrial  science,  then  I  would  have
a serious question about that.

With  regard  to  astronomy,  I  think  that  I  would  defer  to  the  as-
tronomers. As I said at the end of my testimony, if the Shuttle re-
pair  mission  were  not  possible,  for  instance,  return-to-flight  were
not  possible,  then  I  would  recommend  that  tradeoffs  involving  a
rehosting mission should be reviewed by the astronomy community
in the context of its Decadal Survey.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, let us hear from a couple of astrono-

mers. Dr. Beckwith.

Dr.  BECKWITH.  It  is—I  think,  in  looking  at  the  costs,  you  have
to figure out exactly how this would be paid by NASA, rather than
looking at just a lump sum. We know from four servicing missions
what the cost to the science budget of a servicing mission has been.
It  has  been  between  $300  and  $400  million.  It  is  very  easy  to  cal-
culate, because we know what the burn rate is at Goddard, and we
know what the burn rate is at the Institute, and we know the time
it takes to do the mission. That number is very well known. In the
past, NASA has charged science of order $100 million to fly a Shut-
tle  mission  to  Hubble.  I  believe  the  premise  was  that  the  Shuttle
budget  was  funded  at  some  level  of  order  $4  billion  a  year  to  pro-
vide for all the infrastructure it takes to fly the Shuttle. If you flew
the  Shuttle  to  the  station,  or  if  you  flew  the  Shuttle  to  Hubble,
they  were  still  going  to  pay  for  those  Shuttle  flights.  That—there-
fore,  they  did  not  charge  those  costs  to  science.  If,  now,  the  idea
is  that  we  will  still  spend  $4  billion  a  year  on  the  Shuttle  budget,
and  charge  an  additional  billion  dollars  for  a  Space  Shuttle  flight
to  Hubble  from  the  science  budget,  then  I  am  not  quite  sure  how
I  would  come  down.  But  that  has  never  been  the  case  in  the  past.
It  seems  to  me  if  the  science  budget  is  charged  $300  or  $400  mil-
lion for the cost of a Shuttle servicing mission, it is well worth the
cost.  If  the  science  budget  is  charged  $1  to  $2  billion  for  the  cost
of  any  of  the  options  ahead  of  us,  then  I  think  you  would  have  to
go back to the community and ask for a reprioritization.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Yeah,  well,  that  is  what  we  are  trying  to,
because, as Dr. Taylor has speculated, that appears to be the direc-
tion they are going, on the charges.

Dr.  TAYLOR.  But  let  me  say,  if  I  may,  that  I  think  Steve
Beckwith  and  I  are  in  full  agreement  on  that  point,  and  that  the
method of cost accounting has shifted here over five years or so, by
a  large  amount,  which  does  change  the  ballgame  somewhat,  and  I

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

108

think  we  have—are  fully  in  agreement  that  at  the  $300  or  $400
million level, we would surely go right ahead and do the servicing.
At $1 or $1.5 or a $2 billion level, it is not at all so clear.

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  But  why  charge  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission  a
billion dollars when you don’t charge a billion dollars for every mis-
sion  to  the  Space  Station?  There  is  going  to  be  25  or  30  Shuttle
flights  to  the  space  station.  If  you  charge  a  billion  dollars  for  each
one  of  those,  it’s  $30  billion.  That  is  almost  more  than  half  of  the
NASA  projected  budget  over  the  next  five  years.  That—there  is
some accounting here that doesn’t compute properly, if you look at
it  that  way.  So,  I  think  that  there  is  a  real  serious  accounting
issue,  and  it  is  not  that  the  Space—you  are  not  going  to  be  charg-
ing the Space Station $30 billion just for a Shuttle launch, because,
as  I  said,  it  is  more  than  half  of  the  NASA  budget  over  the  next
five  years.  So,  why  charge  a  servicing  mission  a  billion,  if  you  are
not going to do the same cost accounting for the Space Station?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Dr. Norman, you——
Dr. NORMAN. Yes.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—have some words of wisdom to share with

us?

like  to  talk  about  this 

Dr. NORMAN. Perhaps not wisdom, but I will share the words.
I  would 

in  the  context  of  the
programmatics of NASA, and as you know, there have been several
roadmapping activities at the moment, and in the context of the as-
tronomical  roadmap,  that  we  are  all  considering  at  the  moment,
our  goal  with  the  free-flyer  with  HOP,  is  essentially  to  first  repair
the  bridge  in  the  road  that  was  broken  by  the  Columbia  tragedy,
and then we wish to drive over that bridge with our new free-flyer,
and  explore  the  current  territory  that  is  planned  on  the  current
roadmap for Hubble science. This was laid out and expected in the
Academy  report,  and  is  expected  by  everybody  associated  with  the
roadmapping activities.

However,  subsequently,  we  have  the  advantage,  because  of  the
astonishing very wide field imager, that we have on HOP, of using
our newly enhanced turbocharged car, and driving significantly fur-
ther  onwards  in  the  landscape,  to  explore  and  map  quite  new  and
interesting  territories.  Another  way  to  look  at  this  is  that  we  are
trying  to  complete  the  Hubble  science  program  with  this  mission,
but do much more. I think many of you know that under consider-
ations at NASA right now, there is an Origins Probe line and a Be-
yond  Einstein  Probe  line.  These  two  have  been  merged  in  the  new
Administration,  and  we  can  call  them  the  Universe  Probe  line.
Where  the  Hubble  Origins  Probe,  the  free-flyer,  would  sit  quite
naturally,  both 
funding  and
programmatics,  is  that  you  would  see  it  completing  the  Hubble
science,  but  also,  being  first  of  this  Universe  Probe  line.  It  would
start  a  great  series  of  discovery  type  missions,  and  it  would  com-
plete the Hubble science. It would concentrate on these great issues
that  we  all,  I  think,  are  interested  in:  dark  matter,  dark  energy,
the  origin  of  planets,  and  the  associated  question  of  the  origin  of
life. This is the programmatic view.

ment’s indulgence on this budget question also, if I might.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Dr.  Cooper,  the  Chair  has  a  habit  of  in-

dulging expert witnesses.

Dr. COOPER. Okay. So, I would certainly say that this is not wis-
dom, either, along with my colleague, Dr. Norman. However, there
is  a  straightforward  view  of  the  budget  question  at  the  moment,
which  is  NASA’s  plan,  originally,  which  was—strikes  me  as  right-
headed,  was  to  split  the  cost  of  the  robotic  servicing  mission  50-50
between science and exploration. So already, you, what, reduce the
tradeoffs  for  science,  if  you  actually  have  that  scheme  go  forward.
Second  fact,  and  it  doesn’t  get  talked  about  that  much,  more  or
less,  we  have  to  do  the  de-orbit  mission,  and  the  de-orbit  mission
is,  say,  half  a  billion  dollars.  And  you  know,  you  can  look  at  a
scheme in which science, the science half pays for the de-orbit mis-
sion, and the incremental difference, which is maybe half a billion,
is  paid  for  by  exploration.  By  this  funny  math,  you  end  up  that
science gets the servicing mission for free. So, it is a thought to de-
bate.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Creative  accounting.  When  you  referred
earlier to your disappointment that the Committee didn’t visit with
you,  I  assumed  you  were  talking  about  the  Academy  Committee
and not this Committee.

Dr.  COOPER.  Correct.  Well,  I  would  love  to  have  either,  and  in
fact,  we  were  relatively  aggressively  inviting  the  Academy  Com-
mittee,  which  we  regret  that  they  didn’t  come  up,  but  you  know,
it  is  a  magnificent  thing  to  understand  the  reality  of  what  can  be
done,  and  how  it  looks  in  real  life.  I  don’t  know  if  the  video  cap-
tured it, so please do come.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  me  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for

their——

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  I  should  make  a  comment.  We  were  very  con-
cerned  at  that  time.  We  visited  Goddard  several  times,  as  I  indi-
cated,  our  subcommittee.  And  we  were  very  concerned  about  the
fact  that  at  the  time  that  the  invitations  came  to  us  by  email,
largely, at least to my attention, there was a procurement going on,
and  we  were  very  sensitive  to  that  issue.  And  so  we  did  not  go  to
Canada  for  that  purpose.  It  was  in  the  summertime,  and  it  would
have  been  nice  to  go  to  Canada  in  the  summer,  but  we  thought
ethically,  it  would  be  better  not.  But  we  did  visit  Goddard  a  num-
ber of times.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr.  Cooper.  Mr.

Gordon.

THE COST OF A SHUTTLE SERVICING MISSION

Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Listening  to  the  very
interesting  dialogue  between  Dr.  Beckwith  and  Dr.  Lanzerotti  re-
minds of that famous phrase we heard a few years ago, fuzzy math.
So, I think we need to keep that in mind. And let me bring people
back  to  something  I  said  earlier  today.  I  want  to  just  remind  you.
When  I  asked  NASA  Administrator  O’Keefe  to  answer  for  the
record  whether  the  Shuttle-related  costs  of  the  Hubble  servicing
mission would come out of the science budget, his response was as
follows, and I quote: ‘‘This long-planned servicing mission is consid-
ered  grandfathered  in.  Under  this  policy,  and  the  projected  budget
for the mission was included in the five year budget run-out under

of  the  Office  of  Space  Flight.’’  Just  to  put  this  back  in  perspective.
Now——

Mr. PULLIAM. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon.
Mr.  GORDON.  I  know  this  is  a  little  bit  complicated,  but  I—and
so  I  hate  to  say,  you  know,  I  don’t  want  to  cut  you  back,  but  Mr.
Pulliam,  if  you  could  just  be  crisp  in  some  questions  here.  In  your
testimony, you stated that the cost of the Shuttle servicing mission
is,  and  I—in  quotations,  in  the  same  range  as  the  rehost  and  the
robotic  servicing  alternative.  However,  would  it  be  accurate  to  say
that  the  Aerospace  did  not  derive  a  cost  for  the  Shuttle  servicing
mission,  but  instead,  simply  accepted  a  cost  estimate  provided  by
NASA?

Mr. PULLIAM. Mr. Gordon, that is exactly correct. NASA gave us
a  $1.9  billion  number,  and  the  time  for  the  Shuttle  mission,  to
which  we  added  $300  million  for  a  de-orbit  mission  for  a  compari-
son  across  all  options,  and  we  did  not  analyze  that  option,  nor  the
conditions that led to that number.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you. And is it also accurate to say that Aero-
space did not independently validate the cost estimate provided by
NASA?

Mr. PULLIAM. That is correct, sir.
Mr. GORDON. Okay. I am not criticizing you.
Mr. PULLIAM. Yes, sir.
Mr. GORDON. This was not your——
Mr. PULLIAM. Yes, sir.
Mr. GORDON.—your charge. I just——
Mr. PULLIAM. That is right. It is their contract——
Mr. GORDON.—want to——
Mr. PULLIAM.—and their task, and they asked us not to do that.
Mr.  GORDON.  And  are  you  aware  that  the  Government  Account-
ability Office later examined the NASA cost estimate for a Shuttle
servicing mission, and it found that, and I quote: ‘‘NASA could not
provide documented support for key portions of the estimate?’’

Mr. PULLIAM. No, sir. I am not aware of that.
Mr. GORDON. Well, just if you wanted to be more aware of it, the
source is GAO Report 05–04, page 2. And Mr. Lanzerotti, your com-
mittee expressed the belief that, and here, again, I quote: ‘‘Careful
planning  for  and  implementation  of  additional  HST  unique  activi-
ties  to  meet  CAIB  and  NASA  requirements  will  result  in  substan-
tially  lower  actual  costs  to  service  HST,  using  the  Shuttle,  than
those  projected  above.  Lower  than—i.e.,  lower  than  the  cost  esti-
mates provided by NASA. Would you like to elaborate on that?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  I  would  like  to  call  on  General  Bolden  to  make
some  comments  related  to  that,  but  as  an  introduction,  let  me  say
that  our  experience  with  NASA  costs  on  the  Shuttle  were  very
similar  to  what  has  just  been  related  here—I  didn’t  know  this  be-
fore now—but by Mr. Pulliam, in terms of the NASA estimates and
all. But we had experts on our committee, in terms of the—of expe-
rience  with  space  flight.  Mr.  Rothenberg  is  one  of  those,  having
managed  at  NASA  headquarters,  but  General  Bolden,  and  some
other  colleagues  on  the  Committee  were  experts  at  Shuttle  and
Shuttle  costs.  And  General  Bolden,  would  you—this  is  General
Charles Bolden, who is a member of our committee.

General BOLDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon. First of all,
the points that we looked at were the fact that there are a number
of things that were required to comply with the Columbia Accident
Investigation  Board,  as  well  as  the  additional  requirements  that
NASA put on themselves. Our finding was essentially that there is
basically  little,  if  any,  difference  between  the  requirements  for  a
Hubble mission and an International Space Station mission, so the
differential cost, if you will, is minimal. And I think my colleagues
have  said  maybe  $50  million  for  a  Shuttle  flight,  of  a  differential
cost,  because  inspection  and  repair,  micrometeoroid  analysis  and
protection from that, those things have to be done whether you are
flying to the International Space Station, or whether you are doing
an  independent  Hubble  Space  Telescope  mission.  So  there  is  little
difference.

Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you.  I  guess  my  concern  is  this.  The  NASA
Administrator  had  publicly  stated  that  he  was  opposed  to  flying  a
Shuttle  servicing  mission,  yet  we  have  nothing  that  has  been—
independent  validation  of  the  cost,  and  I  think  we  really  have  two
questions  here.  One  is,  what  really  is  the  cost,  and  secondly,  how
should  it  be  allocated?  And  we  just  don’t  have  that  good  answer
yet.  Dr.  Lanzerotti,  let  me  ask  you  once  again.  Your—this  com-
mittee  was  called  upon  by  Administrator  O’Keefe  to  do  this  study.
Is that correct?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Yes,  that  is  correct,  at  the  urging  of  Congress.
Mr. GORDON. Have you reported back to NASA?
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Yes, we have. We——
Mr. GORDON. Have they responded to you?
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  They  have  not  responded  formally  to  us  as  of

Mr. GORDON. Okay. But you have given them a full response.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  We  gave  them—we  briefed  several  Congres-
sional  committees,  including  some  of  the  staff  that  I  see  up  there.
We—and then we spent an hour and a half with NASA briefing our
report to the Administrator and his top staff. In December, Decem-
ber 8, I believe it was. Approximately December 8. We have not re-
ceived any formal responses back from them, as of this date.

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  that  will  be  an  interesting  response.  Again,
I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  who  have  helped  inform  us.  You  have
done  a  good  job  with  your  background.  Okay,  I  will—but  I  think
we—there  are  some  questions  that  you  can’t  answer  that  need  to
be answered before we can move forward. Dr. Taylor?

Dr.  TAYLOR.  Mr.  Gordon,  I  just  wanted  to  ask  for  a  clarification
to  be  sure  I  am  understanding  correctly.  But  are  you  saying  that
Mr. O’Keefe’s statement to you means that a Hubble servicing mis-
sion  would  not,  definitely  not  be  charged  to  the  Science  Direc-
torate?  Because  if  so,  much  of  the  things  that  I  was  talking  about
in my statement, and fearing might be the case, are moot.

Mr. GORDON. That is correct, except for the science-related costs.
Again,  let  me—but  all  I  can  do  is  quote  to  you  what  he  said——

Dr. TAYLOR. Right.
Mr. GORDON.—which I will do once again.
Dr. TAYLOR. Well, you did it twice very effectively, and I am sure

this date.

I heard what you said, and it was——

Mr. GORDON. Wish everybody else did.

Dr. TAYLOR. It was——
Mr. GORDON. Thank you so much.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Do  you  have  readily  at  hand,  or  perhaps  Dr.

Obermann has at hand, a date when that was?

Mr. GORDON. Yes, sir. It was February the 27th, 2002, at a hear-

ing here with NASA, and it was on page 166.

Dr. LANZEROTTI. Thank you very much.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you. And again, thank all of you. This is a—
it  is  an  important  question,  and  clearly,  money  is  a  part  of  the
question,  science  is  a  part  of  the  question,  and  we  are  hopefully
going to get closer to bringing all that together.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon. And it
is a very important question, and it is one that has to be asked and
answered  to  our  satisfaction,  and  the  reference  you  made  to  the
quote was back in ’02, when they were beginning to—changing the
process  of  their  accountings,  and  how  they  were  going  to  go  for-
ward, and so we are going to have NASA up here on the 17th, and
we  are  going  to  ask  specifically  that  question,  and  we  are  going  to
demand  a  very  specific  answer.  So,  Dr.  Taylor,  you  and  I  and  ev-
eryone else will be enlightened. Mr. Reichert.
THE REHOSTING OPTION

Mr.  REICHERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity to be involved in this process as a new Member of Congress.
It has certainly been an interesting discussion.

Dr.  Lanzerotti,  you  state  that  you  have  strong  reservations  re-
garding  a  plan  to  rehost  the  Hubble  cameras  on  a  new  telescope,
but Dr. Norman seems to make a solid argument for rehosting. Dr.
Lanzerotti,  can  you  expand  on  the  specific  concerns  that  you  have
with Dr. Norman’s rehosting concept, and Dr. Norman, do you have
any comments?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Let  me  say  first  that  the  concept  that  Dr.  Nor-
man, Professor Norman presented here this morning were not ones
that  we  completely  evaluated.  When  he  briefed  the  Committee,  I
don’t  recall  that  he  had  the  new  Japanese  telescope  at  that  time.
Am I mistaken on that, or not?

Dr. NORMAN. Unfortunately, you are.
Dr. LANZEROTTI. I am mistaken?
Dr. NORMAN. You are.
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Okay. So I am mistaken. He must have had the
Japanese  telescope  on  there,  but  the—there  is  no  question  in  the
Committee’s  mind  that  there  would  be  a  very  large,  a  significant
science gap between the demise of the Hubble and the rehosted in-
strument.  We  were  asked  to  look  at  the  overall  Hubble  question,
to  not  address  Hubble  prior  to  its  demise,  and  the  possible  going
into  an  unstable,  let  alone  not  useful  state,  would  not  be  wise  for
the  Nation  at  all.  If  the  decision  is  made  not  to  do  anything  with
Hubble,  we  are  going  to  have  to  address  Hubble  for  de-orbit.  We
just  can’t  leave  it  up  there  floating  around  without  addressing  the
de-orbit.

A  robotic  vehicle  has  to  attach  itself  to  Hubble  at  some  point  to
de-orbit it. Hubble has to be in a stable state. It has to be in a state
such that the gyros and the batteries make it, and particularly, the
battery lifetimes, make it such that Hubble has to be accessed. And

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00116 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

113

so,  we—for  one  of  the—for  that  reason,  for  one  of—that  is  the  one
of the reasons why we felt that just concentrating on rehosting, and
the science was not addressing the total Hubble issue, the de-orbit
issue.  We  said,  as  I  stated  in  my  oral  testimony  here,  and  I  have
in my written testimony, that the Shuttle servicing of Hubble could
emplace  fiducials,  could  emplace  grapples  on  the  telescope,  such
that  an  ultimate  de-orbit  module  would  be  much  easier  to  attach
to Hubble to do a controlled reentry into the atmosphere.

A—there is no question that a rehosted Hubble or a new Hubble
going to a different location other than low-Earth orbit would allow
one  to  have  more  science  return,  because  you  wouldn’t  have  the
eclipses  every  orbit—every  90  minutes  that  you  see  around  Earth,
for  example.  That  is  one  of  the  positives.  But  the  Committee  was
concerned, as I indicated in my testimony, was concerned that—ex-
cuse  me—excuse  me—I  don’t  want  to  contradict  myself  here—that
rehosting  would  involve,  really,  a  significant  cost  savings  over  a
Shuttle  repair  mission,  and  the—we  just  had  this  little  dialogue
here  on  fuzzy  accounting,  so  to  speak,  and  we  were—and  we  cer-
tainly  saw  the  big  gap  in  the  science.  There  would  be  no  overlap
with  the  Chandra  and  the  infrared  telescope  Spitzer,  with  a
rehosted  spacecraft.  And  so  this  program  that  has  been  proposed
by  Professor  Norman  has  never  really  been  evaluated  by  this  pri-
ority-setting  decadal  process,  and  that  is  why  I  said  personally,  I
would  recommend  the  tradeoffs  involving  a  rehosting  mission
should  be  reviewed  by  the  astronomy  community  in  the  context  of
its Decadal Survey activities.
Mr. REICHERT. Dr. Norman.
Dr. NORMAN. Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Reichert.
Firstly,  I  would  endorse  an  Academy  review  of  the  HOP  project.
I  believe  we  would  stand  tall  and  strong  against  any  such  review.
And  we  would  like  to  be  as  soon  as  possible,  so  we  can  get  going.
The main issue, I think, here is the famous so-called gap between
the  demise  of  Hubble  and  the  beginning  of  the  HOP  mission.  Cur-
rently, we envisage a 65 month schedule from authority to proceed
to launch. That puts us—that puts HOP into orbit and functioning
at the end of 2010. So, the gap would be two or three years, as was
mentioned by Mr. Pulliam in the Aerospace report. Okay. The anal-
ogy  I  would  like  to  draw  for  you  is  that—imagine  that  you  are  in
a  car,  driving  at  55  miles  an  hour,  heading  from  Washington  to
California.  Okay.  This  is  Hubble.  Okay.  So,  you  are  driving  along.
If  you  go  17  times  faster—this  is  the  wide  field  imager  capability
above  ACS—then  you  are  going  at  something  like  1,000  miles  an
hour.  It  is  the  difference  between  flying  and  driving.  So  that  even
if  there  is  a  short  gap  of  two  or  three  years,  because  of  the  factor
of  17,  we  will  complete  the  science  that  would  have  been  done  by
Hubble  in  that  intervening  two  or  three  years,  by  two  or  three
years  divided  by  17.  This  is  two  months.  So,  in  the  first  two
months, we would overcome that.

The second point about the gap is it may in fact be useful. Many
of  us  who  have  used  Hubble  for  the  last  15  years  have  much  data
that needs thinking about, reducing, thinking about, and even writ-
ing  those  papers  that  are  littering  our  desk.  A  gap  of,  say—let  us
say  this  could  take  one  year  or  so—when  the  enormous  data
stream from the very wide field imager comes down, from the quar-

114

ter  of  a  billion  pixels,  which  will  be  orbiting  in  space,  we  need  to
be  ready.  It  would  be  reasonable  to  have  some  time  to  prepare  for
this.  So,  we  have  thought  about  this  greatly  on  our  team,  and  the
response  to  this  particular  question,  from  Mr.  Reichert,  about  the
gap.  And  we  think  it  would  be  very  reasonable  to  have  a  two  or
three  year  gap.  I  think  if  there  is  a  gap  of  five  years,  for  example,
if  we  don’t  get  the  funding  that  we  need  in  the  time  that  we  need
it,  if  there  is  a  gap  of  five  years,  the  risk  is  that  we  may  lose  the
interest  of  some  of  the  brightest  young  astronomers,  the  aston-
ishing  talent  of  young  astronomers,  that  is  working  on  Hubble
today.  And  that  is  the  argument,  I  think,  for  having  the  political
will, the energy, and the determination to get this—if we decide to
do  the  free-flyer,  there  are  other  options,  of  course.  But  we  need
the political will, the energy, and the determination to hold our feet
to the fire, and NASA’s feet to the fire, get this done in 65 months,
and get on with it.

Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Norman. Thank

you, Mr. Reichert. Mr. Lipinski.

THE MANIFESTING OF A SHUTTLE SERVICING MISSION

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  for  holding
this  hearing.  It  is  a  very  interesting  hearing  to  begin  my  Congres-
sional career, and I look forward to working with you and Mr. Gor-
don  and  all  of  the  Committee  members  as  we  go  forward  during
the—during  this  Congress.  Now,  it  has  been  especially  interesting
hearing  today,  17  years  ago,  I  was  a  young,  aspiring  mechanical
engineer,  and  unfortunately,  my  hopes  were  dashed  by  The  Aero-
space  Corporation  when  they  rejected  my  job  application.  But——

Mr. PULLIAM. Oh, no.
Mr.  LIPINSKI.  But  I  think  I  have  done  okay  since  that  point.  So,
I  won’t  grill  Mr.  Pulliam  about  that.  What  I  wanted  to  ask
about——

Mr. PULLIAM. We are hiring, sir.
Mr. LIPINSKI. It is a little too late. I wanted to ask Dr. Lanzerotti
about  the  availability  of  the  Space  Shuttle.  NASA  told  Aerospace
that  it  would  be  31  months  after  authority  to  proceed  that  the
Shuttle  could  be  used  to  service  Hubble.  Your  committee’s  report
states  that  after  discussions  with  NASA,  you  determined  that  a
Hubble  servicing  mission  should  be  flown  ‘‘as  early  as  the  seventh
flight  after  return-to-flight  without  an  impact  on  the  International
Space Station.’’ So, how did you arrive at that conclusion?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Yes.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Lipinski.  I  am
pleased to answer that. I will make an introductory comment, then
I would like to call upon General Bolden. I would like to make the
introductory comment by saying that our committee used NASA in-
formation,  by  multiple  visits  to  the  Johnson  Space  Flight  Center,
but also made its own assessment by the credibility and the experi-
ence  of  the  members  of  our  committee,  who  have  been  involved  in
NASA space flight activities, both managing at Johnson, managing
at a headquarters, and flying in the Shuttle, both deploying Hubble
and  repairing  Hubble.  And  the  knowledge  base  that  they  have  on
the  experience  of  the  Space  Station,  manufacturing  and  deploy-
ment and development.

115

And with that, I would like to call upon General Bolden, who can

expand more on how the Committee arrived at some of that.

General BOLDEN. Let me try to cover two things, sir, very quick-
ly.  First  of  all,  the—our  estimate  was  approximately  18  months  to
fly  from  the  moment  that  the  Administrator  or  somebody  says
okay,  let  us  go  ahead  and  go  SM4,  fly  a  Shuttle  mission.  That  is
primarily because the mission is, we say, in the can. It is already—
the  design  of  the  mission  is  already  complete.  Some  training  was
in  progress.  It  would  be  a  matter  of  naming  a  crew,  and  from  the
time the crew is named until the time they are ready to fly is his-
torically about a year, about 12 months. So, that is where we came
up with the 18 months.

Why  the  seventh  flight?  If  you  think  about  balance,  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  needs  to  get  to  a  point  where  it  is  aero-
dynamically  and  logistically  balanced,  and  when  we  talk  to  the
NASA  people,  the  International  Space  Station  program  offices,  at
the  point  of  mission  number—the  sixth  flight  to  it,  then  it  essen-
tially  is  a  balanced  system  that  can  take  care  of  itself.  It  can  be
interrupted. It will survive everything else. So, that is why we said
as  early  as  the  seventh  mission.  Ideally,  you  would  like  to  fly  the
first flight out of the chute to Hubble, and you alleviate a lot of the
concerns  that  we  have  about  delays  with  batteries  and  gyros  and
the  other  kinds  of  things.  But  that  was  not  the  decision.  So,  the
seventh  flight  gives  us—gives  the  International  Space  Station  pro-
gram  an  opportunity  to  get  the  International  Space  Station  in  a
balanced situation, or a stable situation, such that it is a nice time
to take a break.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Does  it  matter  if  the  first  Space  Shuttle  flight

falls—gets pushed back further?

General BOLDEN. It makes a difference if the first Space Shuttle
flight  gets  pushed  back,  because  now,  you  have  to  ask  yourself,
when  does  the—if  we  are  going  to  say  the  seventh  flight  is  the
right place, when does that seventh flight fall? If the seventh flight
falls in 2009, 2010, the question that we were challenged to answer
is  already  moot,  because  our—if  you  remember,  our  charge  was  to
find—to  evaluate  options  to  save  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  So,
that  is  where  time  is  of  the  essence.  If  the  Shuttle  return-to-flight
is  delayed  by  a  number  of  years,  I  think  it  is  a  brand  new
ballgame.  We  are  not  even  talking  about  using  Shuttle  anywhere
down the line, other than maybe the first flight, the return-to-flight
flight.  So,  time  is  of  the  essence.  You  talk  about  the  2007  to  2009
timeframe,  when  you  go  beyond  that,  you  know,  you  may  as  well
start  talking  about  a  de-orbit  mission,  and  essentially  forget  about
a lot of the other things we want to do.
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Thank you, Charlie.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REHOSTING CONTINUED

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you. Dr. Taylor, I think you wanted

to respond to Mr. Reichert’s question.

Dr. TAYLOR. If it is all right, I would like to put in one more word
to—in  response  to  Mr.  Reichert’s  question.  I  appreciated  hearing
again  what  Professor  Norman  had  to  say.  You  probably  know  that
one  of  the  ways  that  we  scientists  make  progress  is  we  push  and

comment.

shove  at  each  other,  we  argue,  we  find  the  weaknesses  in  one  an-
other’s  arguments  whenever  we  can,  and  then,  in  the  end,  nature
makes  up  her  mind  about  what  is  really  the  case,  and  we  try  to
agree on it.

I  think  what  needs  to  be  clear  to  you,  Mr.  Reichert,  is  that
Hubble  light,  the  HOP  project,  does  not—it  does  some  things  ex-
traordinarily  well,  it  does  them  faster.  But  it  does  not  do  every-
thing  that  the  present  Hubble  telescope  does.  It  doesn’t  point  as
well.  It—there  are  many  other  things  which  Hubble  does  that—
which  HOP  cannot  do.  And  I  think  the—my  evaluation  of  the  loss
of  science  created  by  the  gap  of  three  years  or  whatever  it  would
be,  between  something  like  2007  and  the  end  of  2010,  is  rather
more significant than Dr. Norman suggested.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  Dr.  Beckwith,  I  think  you  wanted  to

Dr.  BECKWITH.  Well,  since  we  are  into  analogies  here  involving
automobiles  on  the  highway,  I  think  HOP  does  not  replace
Hubble’s capabilities. It has some things, as Dr. Taylor said, which
are  a  little  better,  but  the  analogy  I  would  like  is  you  are  driving
down  the  highway  at  50  miles  an  hour  in  a  car,  and  you  have  the
option  of  going  1,000  miles  an  hour  in  a  motorcycle.  Now,  if  you
alone need to get somewhere fast, that is a very useful option. But
if you want to transport your family from Baltimore to Washington,
say,  in  a  snowstorm,  it  may  be  that  that  speed  is  less  important
than  the  carrying  capacity  and  the  ability  to  stay  out  of  the  snow.
So, Hubble has been enormously successful, because it is a general
purpose  observatory  which  is  able  to  react  to  discoveries  that  we
don’t  have  the  imagination  to  predict  even  a  few  years  ahead  of
time.  And  time  and  again,  Hubble  has  shown  that  it  is  built  with
the  right  set  of  characteristics  to  probe  the  cosmos  in  ways  that,
you  know,  theorists  just  aren’t  predicting.  So,  it  is  useful  to  note
that  in  the  suite  of  programs  that  NASA  has,  it  has  a  mix  of  pro-
grams.  It  has  some  very  small,  specialized  programs.  It  has  me-
dium-sized  programs  which  are  targeted  at  particular  questions.
The  WMAP  program  for  cosmology,  the  COBE  program,  some  of
these  other  programs.  And  it  has  general  purpose  observatories.
The  general  purpose  observatories  have  been  the  most  productive
of  all  of  NASA’s  programs  by  a  long,  long  shot,  and  so  you  have
to think very carefully when you are making substitutions between
that  capability  and  a  capability  which  is  a  little  lighter,  a  little
more  specialized,  and  in  this  case,  would  be  delivered  many  years
later.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Dr. Beckwith, as an aside, can I ask, in the
examples  you  cited,  and  the  one  that  Dr.  Norman  cited,  what  as-
sumptions  are  you  using  with  respect  to  Congress’  reaction  to  my
call for increased CAFE standards?

Dr. BECKWITH. I am sorry, but that is not something I am an ex-

pert on.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you. Mr. Udall.

RISK AND A SHUTTLE SERVICING MISSION

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I,  too,  want  to  acknowl-
edge  the  great  work  that  each  one  of  you  on  the  panel  has  done
to think creatively about where we could proceed with this magnifi-

cent  instrument  that  we  call  Hubble.  I  want  to  also  thank  the
Chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member  for  the  acknowledgment  they
directed  to  me  earlier  in  the  hearing  in  regards  to  the  resolution
that  we  introduced  last  year  in  the  Congress  that  resulted,  Dr.
Lanzerotti,  in  your  panel  going  to  work  and  coming  up  with  your
important recommendations.

It  strikes  me  that  the  tone  of  this  hearing  is  that  it  is  not  if  we
are going to save Hubble, but it is how and when, and I hope that,
in the long run, is what occurs. Mr. Chairman, it also seems worth
noting  that  I  don’t  know  if  we  have  ever  held  a  hearing  where  we
talk about saving a satellite, saving an instrument. Most, if not all,
of the satellites are allowed to, or directed to fall into orbit in some
way  or  another,  and  I  think  that,  in  its  own  way,  speaks  volumes
about the importance of this instrument, and the great brainpower
that  has  been  applied  to  not  only  putting  it  into  orbit  in  the  first
place, but maintaining its life cycle as long as possible.

We have focused on budget concerns and cost accounting and try-
ing to get to the heart of that, I think, it is true there are still some
important  questions  that  have  to  be  answered.  We  have  looked  at
the robotics piece in this hearing, and Dr. Cooper, your efforts have
not  gone  unnoticed,  and  I  would  like  to  associate  myself  with  Mr.
Calvert.  I  am  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee  as  well,  and  re-
gardless  of  what  happens  with  your  mission  here,  I  think  there  is
some very important applications in the long run for what you are
doing.

I  would  like  to  turn  to  the  safety  arena,  and  direct  a  couple  of
questions at Dr. Lanzerotti. In the concerns cited by Administrator
O’Keefe  for  canceling  the  servicing  mission  was  crew  risk,  and  I
think your committee, Dr. Lanzerotti, took that issue head on, and
you stated that the Shuttle crew safety risks of a single mission to
the  Space  Station  and  a  single  Hubble  servicing  mission  are  simi-
lar,  and  the  relative  risks  are  extremely  small.  This  is  an  impor-
tant  finding.  Can  you  elaborate  on  why  your  committee  believes
that to be true?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Udall.  Yes,  I  will.  I  would  like
to  call  upon  General  Bolden  to  give  the  more  definitive  technical
answers.  I  would  like  to  say  that  the  Committee  took  this  part  of
its responsibility very seriously. Human life is at risk. But flight—
human flight in space is a very risky endeavor, and so, we took this
very  seriously.  And  we  understand  if  the  Nation  goes  into  the  di-
rection of exploration beyond low Earth orbit, it is also going to be
a very risky enterprise. We also recognized that the American pub-
lic  has  to  understand  the  risk  issues  related  to  humans  flying  in
space.  And  so,  we  called  upon  the  expertise  of  our  members  of  our
committee  who  have  flown  in  space,  who  have  managed  the  space
human  flights  program,  and  we  have  also  visited  the  Johnson
Space Flight Center several times by a subcommittee to gather the
information that we did.

And  I  would  like  to  have—if  I  might  ask  General  Bolden  to

elaborate on the findings of our committee in that regard.

General BOLDEN. Mr. Udall, thank you very much.
As  I  mentioned  before,  our  charge  was  to  look  at  options  to  as-
sess,  to  save  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  and  we  were  asked  to
look  at  the  relative  risks  between,  primarily  between  robotic,

118

human  missions.  There  are  two  risks  that  we  concerned  ourselves
with.  One  is  the  risk  to  humans.  So,  the  robotic  mission  wins  out,
unquestionably,  hands  down,  because  there  are  no  humans  in-
volved.  The  other  risk  is  one  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  And
our finding there was that because of experience and past perform-
ance,  by  a  small  margin,  a  human  mission,  a  Shuttle  mission  to
Hubble,  we  recommended  as  winning  out.  The  ancillary  point  that
we  were  asked  to  look  at  was  the  comparative  risk  between  the
International  Space  Station  mission  and  Shuttle  to  the  Hubble
Space Telescope. The risks are encountered during ascent, on orbit,
primarily  from  micrometeorite,  micrometeoroid  damage,  and  then
during entry.

For all intents and purposes, the risk to a crew, whether you are
going  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  orbit,  or  whether  you  are
going  to  the  International  Space  Station,  are  the  same  during  as-
cent.  The  primary  difference  becomes  one  of  risk  to  the  crew  on
orbit. In the International Space Station orbit, which is lower than
Hubble,  the—it  is  denser,  in  terms  of  the  amount  of  debris,  so
there  is  some  increased  risk  to  a  crew  in  a  Shuttle  in  the  orienta-
tion  that  we  dock  with  the  International  Space  Station.  There  is
less  risk  from  micrometeoroid  damage,  because  we  can  choose  our
orientation  to  put  the  orbiter  in  a  safer  orientation,  in  terms  of
micrometeoroid debris.

So, that leaves one other thing to be considered, and that is what
we call a safe haven. NASA advertises that the International Space
Station  can  provide  approximately  a  90  day  safe  haven  for  a  crew
in  the  event  that  we  find  that  there  is  some  damage.  Let  me  add
one  thing.  First,  you  have  to  find  out  that  there  is  damage  to  the
vehicle.  If  it  is  determined  that  that  damage  occurs  before  getting
to  the  International  Space  Station,  or  as  happened  on  STS–51–F,
in 1985, you don’t make it to your desired orbit, the advantage goes
away  with  the  International  Space  Station,  because  the  crew  can’t
get  there.  They  may  have  been  trying  to  get  there,  but  they  don’t
get  there  physically.  That  is  a  fact  of  life,  and  that  has  happened
to  us  on  a  previous  Shuttle  mission.  So  there,  you  lose  the  advan-
tage  of  the  safe  haven  from  the  International  Space  Station.  The
question of 90 days is one that we can argue the point. Right now,
I  don’t  think,  and  our  determination  was  that  the  International
Space  Station,  as  presently  configured,  and  as  presently—its  reli-
ability  at  present,  because  of  its  environmental  control  system,  we
don’t  think  it  can  accommodate  a  crew  of  seven  or  more  for  90
days. The Shuttle itself, if you determine early enough in the flight
that it has problems, you can do a power down, something that we
have  practiced  all  the  time,  and  you  can  get  up  to—maybe—you
can  probably  squeeze  out  30,  maybe  45  days  on  orbit,  while  you
mount  a  rescue  mission  or  whatever  it  is.  So,  the  relative  risk  be-
tween  a  mission  to  the  International  Space  Station  and  a  single
mission  to  service  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  is  minimal,  at  best.
That  was  our  assessment.  If  that  is  the  case,  then  it  says,  you
know, there is no human safety concern more from a Hubble Space
Telescope  mission  than  there  is  from  an  individual  International
Space  Station  mission.  And  if  you  look  at  25  or  30  International
Space  Station  missions,  then  it  goes  out  the  window,  astronomi-
cally more risky to complete the International Space Station.

Mr.  UDALL.  General,  thank  you,  and  you  anticipated  my  follow-
on  question  about  safe  havens,  and  the  relative  risks  between  a
Hubble mission and, actually, the station itself, and I also want to
thank you, because the Chairman is a lot more willing to let expert
witnesses  go  on,  particularly  those  who  have  served  our  country
with  distinction,  then  mere  members  of  the  Committee.  So,  thank
you for providing with me with additional minutes on a very impor-
tant question. So, thank you. Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Before  turning  to  Mr.  McCaul.  General,  I
would  like  you  to  clarify  for  the  record,  you  said  by  a  very  small
margin,  that  was  the  exact  phrase  you  used,  you  opted  for  having
astronauts  do  the  repair  rather  than  robotics.  Can  you  amplify
that?

General BOLDEN. I—my reference to a very small margin was in
terms  of  risk  to  the  crew  and  vehicle.  And  that  risk  is  small,  be-
cause the single advantage that I think, and most of my colleagues
think,  a  mission  to  the  International  Space  Station  provides  is  the
presence,  the  ready  presence  of  a  safe  heaven.  If  you  are  damaged
on ascent, and you go to the International Space Station, the crew
still  has  to  get  outside,  inspect,  determine  exactly  where  the  dam-
age  is.  They  have  to  have  a  way  to  either  repair  it—if  they  can’t
repair  it,  which  is  a  very  good  probability,  even  going  into  the  re-
turn-to-flight,  then  you  have  got  to  get  another  Shuttle  up  to  res-
cue the crew. If you go to the Hubble altitude of almost 400 miles,
and  you  determine  that  you  have  a  problem,  you  utilize  the  same
tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  for  inspection  that  we  do  when
we  get  to  the  International  Space  Station.  And  in  determining
where  we  need  to  go  and  make  the  repairs.  If  you  can’t  repair  it
at  the  International  Space  Station,  you  can’t  repair  it  in  the
Hubble  orbit.  So,  you  know,  the  risk  is  minimal,  if  there  is  a  dif-
ference.

And  the  fact  is  that  after  the  first  few  flights—after  about  the
sixth  flight  or—sixth  or  seventh  flight,  when  the  second—Node  2
is placed on the International Space Station, your ability to inspect
and  repair  at  the  International  Space  Station  becomes  essentially
identical  to  that  in  the  Hubble  orbit,  because  now,  you  are  totally
dependent  on  the  orbit—it  is  the  extension  of  the  remote  manipu-
lator  system  arm,  the  OBSS,  you  become  totally  dependent  on  the
OBSS  to  do  the  acreage  survey,  the  look  throughout  the  vehicle  to
determine  where  the  damage  is,  and  that  is  no  different  whether
you are in a Hubble orbit, or whether you are at the International
Space Station.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you. Mr. McCaul.
SHUTTLE SERVICING OPTIONS

Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome
General Bolden, who is actually a fellow Texan, here today, and he
brings a lot of experience, a lot of Shuttle missions, including to the
Hubble Space Telescope. I would say real world experience, maybe
it  is  out  of  this  world  experience,  but  I  appreciate  you  being  here.
I  have  got  a—it  is  actually  sort  of  a  follow-up  question  to  Dr.
Lanzerotti  and  General  Bolden.  In  the  effort  to  save  money,  we
have  25  to  30  Space  Shuttle  missions  budgeted.  Is  it  possible,  and
I know there is a risk involved, is it possible to have a mission that

could—that  is  going  to  the  International  Space  Station,  go  there
and  also  sort  of  go  in  a  detour  route  to  the  Hubble  telescope  to  fix
it? That is my first question.

Dr. LANZEROTTI. I think the problem there is simply one of Shut-
tle  lift  capability.  Charlie  can  correct  me  if  I  am  wrong  on  these,
because he has flown that truck, and I haven’t. But the Shuttle will
be  fully  utilized,  carrying  up  two  new  instruments,  as  well  as  all
the other equipment that are needed for the refurbishing of the tel-
escope.  And  so,  there  would  be  no  extra  cargo  bay  available  to  go
to the station. Also, they are in very different orbits. Very different
orbits. The——

Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  And  that  is  also—makes  it  impossible,  essen-

tially impossible, from the point of view of celestial mechanics.

THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE’S PROJECTED LIFE

EXPECTANCY

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Okay.  I  think  that  answers  that.  My  second  ques-
tion is to Dr. Norman, and it is my understanding that either way,
if  we  fix  the  telescope,  that  it  will  still  go  out  in  the  year  2013.  Is
that a correct assumption, or is that not?

Dr. NORMAN. Mr. McCaul, if you could clarify that a little bit.
Mr. MCCAUL. Well, if we send either robotic or the Shuttle to re-
pair  the  Hubble  telescope—maybe  I  should  ask  it  another  way.
How long would that keep the Hubble telescope alive and well?

Dr.  NORMAN.  It  is  a  good  question.  I  am  not  actually  technically
qualified  to  answer  that,  but  the  time  between  servicing  missions
is  the  order  of  three  to  five  years,  so  that  we  may  well  have  to  go
there again if we wish to keep it alive. So, that would be if we get
there  in  2008  this  time,  and  I  think  you  are  right,  the  outer  limit
would be 2013. Yes.

COST OF REHOSTING

Mr. MCCAUL. Right. And so, we are looking at, I have heard esti-
mates  from  $500  million  to  a  billion  dollars  to  fix  it,  and  I—my
next question is how much would it cost to just send a Hubble tele-
scope  with  modern  technology  that  we  have  today,  up  into  space,
with  the  possibility  of  not  having  to  repair  it  every  three  to  five
years?

Dr.  NORMAN.  Right.  The—it  costs  a  billion  dollars  to  do  the  fa-
mous  HOP  project.  We  are  not  intending  to  make  that  robotically
serviceable at the moment, although we may do this later, if we go
into detail design phase. But—so, the nominal lifetime of this new,
state  of  the  art  technology  telescope  will  be  five  years,  and  there-
fore,  it  will  go  from  2010  to  2015.  In  the  meantime,  of  course,
JWST  will  come  online,  and  other  major  facilities.  But  it  will  do
great  work  in  that  five  years.  If  the  nominal  lifetime  is  five  years,
one  might  expect  that  it  would  last  significantly  longer,  based  on
other  NASA  missions.  And  of  course,  if  one  went  into  the  robotics
issue, and said that robotics would, in fact, be ready by 2015, then
that could be the first robotic servicing mission.

Mr. MCCAUL. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Mr.  Melancon.  You  are  up.  Mr.  Matheson.

THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE AND DARK ENERGY

Mr. MATHESON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I have a ques-
tion  for  Dr.  Beckwith.  I  am  interested  in  your  thoughts  about
this—developing  greater  understanding  of  dark  energy,  and  the
role that you foresee Hubble being able to undertake in the future,
based  on  decisions  that  are  made  on  what  we  do  with  Hubble.  If
it  is  refurbished,  how  do  you  see  how  it  could  play  a  role  in  devel-
oping greater understanding for us about dark energy?

Dr.  BECKWITH.  Well,  right  now,  there  are  two  basic  possibilities
for dark energy. One is that is what Einstein envisioned in his gen-
eral  relativity  equations.  It  is  what  is  called  a  cosmological  con-
stant.  It  is  a  property  of  the  fabric  of  space-time.  And  the  other
possibility  is  it  is  something  else  that  we  don’t  know  about.  Now,
it if is Einstein’s—if it is according to Einstein’s theory, it is a con-
stant.  It  is  ever—it  is  not  changing.  And  the  easiest  way  to  verify
that  or  not  is  to  look  back  very  far  in  time  and  compare  what  the
universe was doing a long time ago with what it is doing now. And
Hubble  is  unique  for  doing  that.  That  is,  at  very  early  times,  only
Hubble  can  actually  detect  and  measure  the  supernovae  needed  to
make those measurements.

So,  as  we  speak,  Hubble  is  making  progress  on  this  problem.  It
will make a great deal of progress in three years, and with an up-
graded instrument, with the Wide Field Camera 3, its rate will also
accelerate  by  a  big  factor  over  what  it  does  today,  and  so,  it  is  en-
tirely  possible  that  with  Hubble,  you  could  rule  out  one  of  those
possibilities  in  the  next  five  years  or  so.  Now,  of  course,  we  don’t
know,  but  that  is  really,  I  would  say,  the  hope  with  Hubble,  that
we  will  know  if  it  was  Einstein  or  something  weird.  Now,  if  it  is
something  weird,  of  course,  we  don’t  really  know.  I  mean,  Hubble
will contribute, but obviously, you would have to sit back—sit down
and design a very specialized mission for it.

I  think  it  would  be  useful,  of  course,  if  the  Committee  could  es-
tablish  a  dark  energy  policy,  so  that  we  really  understood,  you
know,  what  the  Nation  wanted  to  do  on  this  problem.  But  in  fact,
I  think  that  is  going  to  be  part  of  the  science  community’s  next
Decadal Survey.

Mr. MATHESON. Would this be an example, you mentioned earlier
that we are dealing with circumstances where things are unimagi-
nable.  Is  this  an  example  of  those  things?  When  Hubble  was
launched, did we have a sense that this was going to be a field that
would be evaluated?

Dr. BECKWITH. No. There was no significant active research into
this particular problem. The breakthrough came in 1997, 1998, two
different  groups  verified  this  within  a  year,  actually,  within  six
months  of  the  time  it  was  announced,  Hubble  began  doing  this.
Hubble has now taken over an entire subfield of this research, and
it  is  completely  unique  for  looking  back  into  the  distant  time  to
see—early universe to see how much this has changed. This is one
of—I can come up with three very prominent examples that every-
body  could  understand  that  didn’t  even  become  topics  of  research
until Hubble was up there working. And in one case, it was Hubble
that generated the entire topic. So, that is the power of Hubble.

AEROSPACE CORPORATION ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS VERSUS

REALITY REGARDING A ROBOTIC SERVICING MISSION

Mr.  MATHESON.  I  have  one  other  line  of  questioning  I  wanted  to
ask, and in my limited time, this may be—limited on what you can
answer  as  well,  as  a  group,  but  general  question  based  on  The
Aerospace Corporation report. As I understand it, both the Shuttle
and  robotic  service  mission  have  comparable  life  cycle  costs,  with
the  data  that  you  were  given.  The  Shuttle’s  development  time  is
about  two  and  a  half  years.  Has—will  it  proceed  as  a  medium  de-
velopment  risk  and  mission  risk.  The  development  time  for  the
robotic  is  5.4  years,  and  is—has  what  would  be  characterized  as  a
higher development and mission risk. Now, I realize the report did
not take into account the specific robotics work already under way
in  the  summer  of  2004,  but—and  there  are  recent  reports  not
known  at  the  time  of  the  report—recent  developments  not  known
at the time the report was composed, that suggest the robotic mis-
sion  risk  and  time  was  actually  lower  than  was  asserted  before.
And you may have covered this. I apologize. I was late getting into
this  hearing,  so  this  may  have  been  covered  before  I  got  here.  If
that  is  true  that  they  are  actually  lower  than  have  been  asserted,
how  much  risk  reduction  have  we  seen,  and  how  much  time  has
been  gained  on  the  robotic  option?  That  would  be  the  question  I
would throw out. I don’t know who wants to answer that.
Mr. PULLIAM. Mr. Matheson, I would just start out——
Mr. MATHESON. Sure.
Mr. PULLIAM.—with a reiteration of what we did. The—as I have
said before, ours—as you said, ours was an analytical capability as-
sessment,  and  not  a  programmatic  assessment.  But  you  know,  the
statement  was  made  earlier  that  the  Aerospace  database  was
fraught with clean sheet of paper exercises, and that this particular
development is not a clean sheet of paper.

Mr. MATHESON. Right.
Mr. PULLIAM. I would say that, as I said to the Committee at my
opening  remarks,  our  analyses  come  from  the  analysis  of  how
things  come  out,  not  how  they  began.  So,  whatever  heritage  is  in
whatever program gets built in to the numbers we use. So, I would
say that the only way that the Congress would know that, or even
others might know that, is to look specifically at that program. But
we  would  be  the  first  to  congratulate  anyone  who  comes  in  below
cost and ahead of schedule.

Mr. MATHESON. Sure.
Mr. PULLIAM. But I think program assessments are the way one

would find that out.

Mr. MATHESON. Dr. Cooper.
Dr. COOPER. Thank you for the opportunity to respond, Congress-
man. First, a comment. You made the comment that The Aerospace
Corporation  asserted  comparable  costs  for  the  missions.  Even  as-
suming that is true, I want to point out that the value outside the
Hubble mission is not comparable. That is, there is basically noth-
ing to be learned by sending astronauts to repair the Hubble. How-
ever,  if  we  do  the  robotic  mission,  we  are  doing  a  lot  for  the  space
program  outside  saving  the  Hubble.  So,  the  costs  may  be  com-
parable, but the value is hugely different, which changes the value

equation totally. And the second part of your question was basically
how much risk has been reduced since the initial appraisal of the—
that  one,  the  best  way  I  can  characterize  that  is  how  the  process
occurs,  and  the  process  occurs  by—one  of  the  great  values  of  the
NAS  report  is  it,  as  you  would  expect,  highlighted  a  number  of
areas  of  risk.  And  as  we  understand  what  the  risk  areas  are,  we
work  relentlessly  to  eliminate  them  one  by  one.  And  a  number  of
them,  we  have  basically  disposed  of  at  this  point.  For  example,
originally, there was a great deal of concern about the time delayed
control  of  robotic  systems  in  orbit,  when  the  astronauts  driving
them  on  the  ground.  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  on  the  basis  of—for
example,  NASA  recently  actually  issued  a  safety  approval,  after  a
long scrutiny, of doing this for—controlling the space station robot,
that  we  pretty  much  know  that  one  cold.  Another  one  that  I  re-
ferred  to  earlier,  there  is  a,  you  know,  there  is  a  big—there  is  a
lot  of  specific  motor  tasks  that  have  to  be  achieved  to  service  the
telescope,  upgrade  it.  That  one,  we  have  also  gone  a  long  way  to-
wards retiring the risk on that one.

There  is  another  class  of  risks  which  are  harder  to  address,
which  are  we  haven’t  flown  autonomous  rendezvous.  We  haven’t
flown  autonomous  capture,  and  the  thing  I  would  tell  you  about
that  is  the  rest  of  the  space  community  understands  that  those
risks  are  very  important  for  a  lot  of  reasons,  DOD  reasons  among
them,  and  there  is  a  whole  sequence  of  space  flights  planned  that
are  going  to  essentially  relentlessly  eliminate  those  risks  one  by
one. And the net of this is, at the moment, our view is, by the time
we come to launch this thing, there is nothing left for us to do but
actually  go  up  there  and  do  the  mission,  because  everything  we
could possibly think of will have been covered by that point.

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Mr.  Matheson,  our  committee  was  concerned
that  some  of  these  missions  that  may  do  these  kinds  of  things  for
autonomous  rendezvous  would  be  long  after  the  necessity  for  serv-
icing Hubble.

Mr. MATHESON. Okay.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  And  so  we  were  concerned  that  you  might  not
be  able—one  might  not  be  able  to  service  Hubble  reliably  with  an
uncooperative  target  that  Hubble  presents.  You—basically,  you
have got a huge investment up there that is doing fantastic astron-
omy, and it could be—it is being used as a target for potential DOD
missions  or  whatever  else,  as  Mr.  Cooper  said.  And  our  committee
was  concerned  with  using  Hubble  as  a—just  a  target  vehicle  for
doing other things that may be applicable with—downstream.

Mr. MATHESON. I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much. Mr. Rohrabacher.

VALUE OF A ROBOTIC SERVICING MISSION TO EXPLORATION

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I
would like to thank Mr. Udall, who may have left the room by now,
for  inspiring  this  hearing,  and  you  know,  goosing  us  in  the  right
direction a few months ago. I remember people were not paying the
attention  to  this  as  we  should,  and  then,  Mr.  Chairman,  your  per-
sonal  leadership,  and  making  sure  we  have  a  hearing  as  high  a
quality  as  we  have  had  today,  has  to  be  commended.  Mr.  Cooper,
I think the last point you made, and—was something people should

focus  on,  and  that  is  your  analysis  of  the  value  of  a  successful  ro-
botics  mission,  as  compared  to  the  value  of  another  mission  that
would  be  successful.  And  I  happen  to  believe  that  part  of  what  we
are doing here is pushing the envelope on humankind’s capabilities
in space. That is part of what we are doing. We are not just fixing
the telescope. We are making sure that humans can do things that
they can’t do now in outer space, and there is a great deal of value
to  that,  and  a  great  deal  of  actually  getting  experience  in  doing
things  with  robotics,  so  I  buy  that.  I  buy  that  argument.  And  I
think that when we are analyzing what goes on here, that must be
part  of  our  decision  making  factor,  as  to  how  much  it  is  going  to
be worth to humankind to have developed further skills in the use
of robots in space.

Let me note that the situation with the Shuttle and—has not ex-
actly  been  defined  here,  and  I  would  like  to  go  into  that  for  a  mo-
ment. And the Academy report states that if the Shuttle can go up,
and  that  a  second  Shuttle  could  be  launched  if  there  is  a  rescue
mission that is needed. So, we have got that exit strategy. First of
all, is an exit strategy essential for us to be able to use the Shuttle?
That is——

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Rohrabacher.  With  regard  to

your first comment about the value of—if I might——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.—about  the  values  of  humans  and  robots  and
interactions in space for exploration. You are absolutely right. It is
a  value—but  it  also  is  a  value  judgment  in  terms  of  whether  you
want  to  use  Hubble,  this  facility  that  is  operating,  as  a  target  to
do  that  kind  of  practicing,  in  case  of  failure.  I  mean,  one  could
imagine that one could launch something else up there to do target
practice——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Of  course,  there  are  some  people,  you  have
to  remember,  who  are  arguing  just  to  bring  Hubble  down  right
now, and it is not worth doing all the rest of it.

Dr. LANZEROTTI. That is absolutely right. In my——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. So, they——
Dr. LANZEROTTI. In my——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. That is part of the equation.

SAFE HAVEN AND A SHUTTLE SERVICING MISSION

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  In  my  opening  testimony,  I  indicated  that  in-
deed—remember,  the  Committee  was  agnostic  on  that  to  begin
with.  There  are  many  members  that  thought  that  Hubble  was  not
worth saving until they dealt and did the analytical analysis. With
regard to your—but I said it is a value judgment, and indeed, that
is  a  judgment  that  the  Congress,  in  its  wisdom,  and  the  American
people  can  decide,  if  Hubble  should  be  a  target  for  practice  like
that. With—your second point, however, had to do with the standby
Shuttle. I would like to have General Bolden make a couple of com-
ments  related  to  that,  but  let  me  point  out  that  NASA’s  return-to-
flight implies a Shuttle on the launch pad for the first two launches
in  return-to-flight  at  this  point,  to  the  best  of  my  understanding.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay.
Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  It  is  not  a  requirement  for  us  to  have  a  second
Shuttle on the launch pad for a Hubble service. We point out that,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00128 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

125

since  that  is  the  case  for  the  first  two  flights,  and  if  NASA  is  con-
cerned  about  a  rescue,  then  that  would  not  be  unreasonable  to
have  for  our—for  a  Hubble  mission  as  well.  And  General  Bolden
can  relate  to  you  that  NASA  has  had  two  Space  Shuttles  on  the
pad in the past with this kind of timing.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  The  question  is,  is  if  they  are—cannot—is

that a prerequisite? If they are——

Dr. LANZEROTTI. No, it is not a prerequisite at all.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay.
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Charlie—may Charlie?
General  BOLDEN.  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  it  is  not  a  prerequisite,  as
Dr.  Lanzerotti  says.  However,  I  think  NASA  has  deemed  it  pru-
dent, and we don’t argue with that point, by what we got from our
visits  to  the  Johnson  Space  Center,  the  second  vehicle  on  the  pad
causes up to a 30 day slip in the time that you would start prepa-
ration for a—or have another Shuttle ready to back into the Inter-
national  Space  Station  flow.  If  I  may,  I  want  to  respectfully  dis-
agree with one of the things you just said, because I think it is im-
portant  for  people  not  to  mix  apples  and  oranges.  You  mentioned
the  fact  that  pushing  the  envelope—and  Dr.  Cooper  has  said  that
pushing the envelope is an important mission, or an important as-
pect  of  this  mission.  That  was  not  in  the  mission  objectives  until
today. So——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, I—let me tell you, General, it has been
in  the—in  our  agenda  since  the  forming  of  this  Committee,  and  it
may  not  be—NASA  may  not  recognize  it  as  part  of  its  goals  offi-
cially, but whatever project we are involved in should assume that,
so I don’t buy that at all.

General  BOLDEN.  I  understand.  The  other  point  to  be  made,  in
terms  of  our  report  is  people  generally  tend  to  say  that  we  oppose
the  robotic  mission.  We  encouraged  NASA  to  continue  its  develop-
ment of the robotic capability. In fact, we said that you—that they
will need the robotic capability, not only for the Exploration Initia-
tive,  but  in  order  to  de-orbit  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  So,  we
think it is critical that they continue down the road of the develop-
ment  of  the  robotic  mission.  We  all  need  to  understand  that  that
mission, however, has to be successful. And in order to optimize its
chances for success, we feel that utilizing a proven Shuttle mission
to do the servicing of Hubble, and also, installing fiducials, install-
ing  attachment  configuration  pieces  that  will  enable  Dr.  Cooper’s
robot to be—to have a better chance of correctly and effectively de-
orbiting  Hubble,  does  respond  to  one  of  NASA’s  charges,  which  is
to safely de-orbit Hubble, and lower the risk to the public at large.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Let  me  note,  if  the  Chairman  will  indulge
me,  this  isn’t  a  must  do  mission.  Obviously,  we  have  people  advo-
cating  that  we  simply  bring  it  down.  So,  it  is  not  a  must  do  mis-
sion.  Where  else  can  give  a  better  incentive  for  people  to  push  the
envelope  on  technological  know-how  than  in  a  mission,  that  if  it
fails,  it  is  not  that  great  a  failure,  because  when  people  have  al-
ready argued to bring it down in the first place.

General  BOLDEN.  Sir,  I  think  you  misunderstood  my  statement.
I—my  statement  is  what  is  essential,  if  we  are  to  comply  with
NASA’s charge, and that is to safely de-orbit Hubble, it is essential
that  a  robotic  mission  work,  and  we  feel  that  flying  the  human

servicing  mission  does  two  things.  It  optimizes,  or  it  better  en-
hances  the  probability  of  a  successful  robotic  mission  to  enable  us
to de-orbit Hubble. That is——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right. Well——
General BOLDEN. That is all——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, at the same time——
General BOLDEN. That is all I was saying.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  at  the  same  time,  putting  human  life
at  risk,  where  we  have  got  an  option  where  human  life  is  not  at
risk  at  all,  so  that  becomes  not  a  factor  to  be  even  developed.  One
more line of questioning, if I could get into, just so I will note that
to  the  degree  that  we  cannot—we  don’t  have  to  use  Shuttle,  we
shouldn’t  be  using  Shuttle  to  the  degree,  because  right  now,  we
have  had  these  two  catastrophic  accidents.  We  know  that  there  is
a  great  deal  of  risk  involved  in  the  Shuttle.  So,  that  is  something
that  we  have  to  keep  in  our  mind  as  well.  And  NASA  has  been
dragging  its  feet,  Mr.  Chairman,  on  several  areas,  where  we  are
trying to refrain from using Shuttle unless we have to. This is one
example.  Another  example  is  where  we—for  example,  where  the
Space Station can be serviced with a non-Shuttle type of operation,
maybe  even  a  private  sector  operation,  that  we  do  it  this  way.
NASA  has  been  dragging  its  feet  on  that.  Some  people  just  want
to dive back into the use of the Shuttle, as if these accidents, these
catastrophic  accidents,  didn’t  happen.  Well,  let  us—we  can’t  move
forward  on  that  basis.  And  Mr.  Cooper,  finally,  let  me  give  you  a
chance to—you have sat there, and if you are going to refute or——

Dr. COOPER. Thank you, Congressman.
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—whatever.
Dr.  COOPER.  Actually,  my  initial  reaction  was  you  were  doing  a
much  more  eloquent  job  of  stating  the  position  I  believe  than  I
could. However, I do want to object strongly, strongly to the charac-
terization of the Hubble servicing mission with robots as practicing,
and  in  fact,  let  me  tell  you  about  something.  It  is  a  DOD-funded
mission called Orbital Express. The explicit purpose of this mission
is  in  fact  to  do  this  practicing,  and  this  practicing  will  have  oc-
curred prior to when we go up to the Hubble. There will be no prac-
ticing involved in this situation.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  and  Mr.  Chair-
man,  again,  let  me  congratulate  you  for  putting  together  some
team here, that could look at all of the sides of this argument, and
give us such a—the benefit of having the value of all of their opin-
ions. We appreciate it.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  thank  you  for  contributing  to  inter-

esting exchanges. Thank you. Ms. Jackson Lee.

THE ‘‘SCIENCE GAP’’ AND REHOSTING

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  add,
too,  my  appreciation  for  this  hearing.  I  think  the  Chairman  well
knows,  and  we  have  had  some  interesting  exchanges  between  my-
self and the Chairman and other Members of the Committee. Over
the years, my concern has been the question of safety. And I am—
been, if you will, very keen on some of the testimony that we have
heard this morning, and now, this afternoon, on questions of choice,
of  what  you  would  use,  but  also,  the  variables  between  using  a

127

human  Space  Shuttle,  versus  robotic.  Let  me  also  acknowledge
General Bolden. It is good to see you again. I have been a neighbor
for  a  long  time,  and  as  you  well  know,  concerns  about  the  human
space  flight,  for  those  of  us  from  Texas,  is  personal.  And  particu-
larly  in  the  backdrop  of  the  Columbia  7  tragedy,  that  was  com-
memorated  yesterday,  I  believe  these  issues  are  extremely  impor-
tant, as well as the science that the Hubble Space Telescope allows
us  to  participate  in.  And  so  my  line  of  questioning  goes  along  the
lines  of  choices,  along  with  the  question  of  the  budget.  And  I  do
thank  the  Committee  for  the  work  that  it  has  done,  and  I  would
hope that we would move expeditiously, because you have given us
sort of a framework and a timeframe of how fast we need to move.
I am looking at a calendar—we are now looking at the reauthoriza-
tion of the Voter Rights Act of 1965. You wonder how that relates,
but we have got to get moving, because it expires within a two year
period.  You  are  telling  me  that  we  are  looking  at  expiration  of  the
Hubble  in  its  ability  to  function  very  shortly.  So,  let  me  ask  this.
On  the  rehosting,  if  we  were  to  do  the  rehosting,  there  is  a  gap  of
time  that  it  takes  to  have  that  implemented,  what  is  the  time—
what  is  the  gap  of  time?  How  long  would  that  be,  that  we  would
be  waiting,  if  we  did—if  we  opted  for  the  rehosting  and  the  build-
ing, if I understand, of certain equipment, how long would that be?
Let  me  add  to,  I  think,  an  explanation  that  General  Bolden  was
trying to give, and that is the distinction, or any sort of safety gap
between  a  human  Space  Shuttle  to  the  Space  Station  versus
human Space Shuttle to Hubble. I would like to keenly understand
whether—how  finite  that  difference  is,  and  I  would  share  with  my
colleagues,  I  take  issue  with  whether  or  not  we  should  abandon
human  Space  Shuttle.  I  absolutely  believe  we  should  not.  If  the
President  has  announced  a  space  exploration,  whether  or  not  we
use  a  different  type  of  equipment,  human  Space  Shuttle  is  going
to be very vital, or the human space opportunity is going to be very
vital.  Why  not  let  us  get  additional  expertise  by  doing  the  good
works  of  securing  the  Space  Station  or  Hubble?  So  if  I  might  ask
the  gap  on  the  rehosting,  and  then,  can  I  get  clearly,  the  distinc-
tions  of  safety  going  in  both  directions?  I  would  like—I  will  start
with Mr. Pulliam, and then, Dr. Lanzerotti, and if you would yield,
to also General Bolden as well.

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Yes,  I  intended.  After  I  have  had  my  little  one

minute——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. That is all right.
Dr. LANZEROTTI.—of fame.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Pulliam.
Mr. PULLIAM. Ms. Jackson Lee, our analyses showed that Hubble
would—probably near the end of its science life, in 2007, 2008. We
know  that  extraordinary  measures  are  being  taken  to  preserve
power  and  other  kinds  of  things  to  keep  that  science  life  going  as
long as it can. We analyzed that Hubble would be at the end of its
serviceable state in 2009, with science ending before that.

Our  estimates  for  our  completely  rebuilt,  new  rehosting  mission
were in the 2011–2012 timeframe, so you know, we banded it very
broadly by saying a two to seven year science gap. I can’t imagine,
under the analyses we did, getting much less than that. So, on the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00131 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

128

order  of  five  years,  I  would  say,  would  be  about  a  mean  on  how
long we think the science gap would be.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  And  how  great  do  you  perceive  that  science
gap  to  be,  when  I  say  we  have  five  years,  but  how  much  will  we
be set back because of that?

Mr.  PULLIAM.  Well,  I  will  have  to  defer  on  that  one.  We  deter-
mined  early  on  that  probably  in  doing  our  analysis,  we  shouldn’t
make  evaluations  about  the  science.  So,  we  went  to  what  we  call
the science surrogate, and that is what is the instrument suite that
one  would  have,  realizing  that  these  folks  to  my  left  will  use  that
to the best interest of the Nation. So, you know, if Hubble does end
its science life, and there is a number of years in the four, five, six
year  range,  with  no  science  at  all,  then  I  expect  my  colleagues  to
my left would have grave concerns about that.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Dr. Taylor.
Dr.  TAYLOR.  I  could  just  point  out  that  one  of  the  very  serious
losses, if there were a gap as large as five years, would be the loss
of people in the community who would need to find other things to
do  during  those  times,  and  probably  would  not  be  replaced.  We
would  not,  during  that  time,  be  attracting  into  doing  advanced
studies,  new  Ph.D.  students  in  the  field  and  things  like  that.  It  is
very hard to turn the progress of that kind of a background of peo-
ple off, and then turn it on again five years later.

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Thank  you.  I  have—our  committee  would  basi-
cally  agree  with  the  assessment  of  Aerospace  and  Dr.  Taylor  that
it is of the order of five years or more of this science missed. Before
I turn to General Bolden on the risk, I would like to make one com-
ment.  Dr.  Cooper  commented  about  the  Orbital  Express  mission,
which is late 2006. I would like to point out, in response to a ques-
tion  from  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  who  has  to  step  out,  I  see,  the  Orbital
Express is, again, a cooperative mission. It has cooperative targets,
like  the  Russian  missions.  It  does  not  demonstrate  Hubble  capa-
bility in its purest sense. So, I would like to get that on the record,
as well.

Now,  with  regard  to  risk,  and  some  of  your  more  detailed  ques-

tions, I will defer to my colleague, General Bolden.

SAFETY

General BOLDEN. Thank you very much, Ms. Jackson Lee. I went
back  to  my  notes  from  our  conversation  with  the  NASA  Orbiter
Project  Office,  because  I  wanted  to  make  sure  that  what  I  said  is
what  we  agree  with  NASA  on.  And  when  they  talk  about—when
we  all  talk  about  mission  risks,  or  risks  to  life,  it  comes  from  sev-
eral sources. One is debris elimination. That is mainly debris from
the  tank  or  debris  from  anywhere  else  on  the  launch  pad,  during
the  launch  process.  Everyone  agrees  that  that  risk  is  essentially
the  same.  There  is  no  difference  whether  you  are  going  to  Hubble
or  whether  you  are  going  to  the  International  Space  Station.  With
reference to debris risk on orbit, that is where there is a slight dif-
ference.  The  Hubble  altitude,  because  we  can  maneuver  the  way
that we want to, and we can put the wing into the wind, if you will,
and  I  am  using  very  loose  terms  here,  okay.  But  if  you  figure  the
debris is coming with the wind, in the Hubble altitude, we can put
the wing into the wind to minimize the risk to the vehicle. The way

that we orient the Shuttle presently to the International Space Sta-
tion,  the  belly  of  the  orbiter  is  into  the  wind.  So,  it  is  most—it  is
at  its  greatest  exposure  to  debris  risk  on  orbit  from  an  Inter-
national  Space  Station  configuration.  So,  that  makes  ISS  more
risky from that standpoint.

The  next  thing  comes  to  crew  rescue,  if  it  is—well,  we  then  go
to  inspection  and  repair.  The  inspection  process  that  has  been  de-
veloped, and continues to be developed, will need to be, by NASA’s
own  desire,  will  need  to  eventually  become  autonomous,  such  that
it  can  be  accomplished  no  matter  where  the  Shuttle  is,  whether  it
is in a Hubble orbit, or whether it is in an International Space Sta-
tion  orbit.  And  because  of  the  way  that  the  International  Space
Station  configuration  is  gradually  being  modified,  there  will  come
a day, after Node 2 is installed on the International Space Station,
that  the  Shuttle  will  need  an  autonomous  inspection  capability
anyway, because Node 2 will prevent us from being able to see and
reach  things  that  we  can  reach  right  now,  while  Hubble  is—while
the  Shuttle  is  docked  to  the  International  Space  Station.  So,  in-
spection  and  repair,  by  NASA’s  own  desire,  will  be  equal,  whether
you  are  at  the  International  Space  Station  or  whether  you  are  at
the Hubble Space Telescope.

The next thing is crew safety, and this is where the margin goes
to  the  International  Space  Station.  NASA  says  there  is  a  90  day
safe  haven  capability  at  the  International  Space  Station.  That  is
questionable,  extremely  questionable,  at  present,  because  of  the
present  state  of  the  environmental  control  system,  the  environ-
mental life support system, on the International Space Station. So,
it  can  go  somewhere  from  30  to  90  days,  where  a  crew  can  wait
for  a  rescue  mission  to  be  mounted.  When  you  power  down  the
Shuttle, once you have discovered that there is a problem, you can
have  anywhere  up  to  a  30  or  45  day  period  of  time,  where  just  an
orbiting  Shuttle  in  a  Hubble  Space  Telescope  altitude,  or—could
also  stay  with  its  own  safe  haven,  as  the  Shuttle  itself.  This  does
not  give  any  consideration  to  commercial  recommendations  of  safe
havens  that,  I  think,  some  of  your  committee,  or  staffers  have  al-
ready  seen.  So,  you  know,  the  matter  of  providing  safe  havens  to
a crew is kind of open ended, but right now, the margin there goes
to  the—to  being  docked  to  an  International  Space  Station,  hope-
fully that helps.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the Chairman for his indulgence. Does
anyone  believe  that  this  mission  should  be  scrapped,  or  that  we
should not try to save the Hubble telescope? Anyone on this panel?
So, we have a job to do. Is that correct?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

HUBBLE SERVICING AND ITS RELATION TO EXPLORATION

Mr. SODREL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a new Member of the
Committee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions,  and  as
a freshman here, I bring a business background. And if I might de-
fend those folks that are on the low side and the high side of what
a  Shuttle  costs,  cost  accounting  is  more  art  than  science,  unfortu-
nately. I mean, which of the costs are fixed, which are variable? Of

130

the fixed costs, how do you amortize them, over how many flights?
What  is  the  useful  life  of  the  asset?  I  mean,  those  are  the  kind  of
discussions  that  we  have  in  business.  You  know,  how  long  is  this
asset going to last, how much will we use it, and how much do we
need  to  charge  to  each  use  of  it?  So  those  are  not  easy  questions.
I find that costs are rarely as expensive as a pessimist would have
us  believe,  and  they  are  rarely  as  inexpensive  as  the  optimist
would have us believe. So, somewhere in the middle is probably the
cost.  And  my  question  goes  somewhat  to  that.  Did  we  consider
costs—and this, to Dr. Lanzerotti. Did the Committee consider how
the robotic mission to the Hubble would directly apply to future ex-
ploration  missions,  to  the  Space  Station,  or  the  Moon?  In  other
words,  can  we  amortize  that  cost?  Is  this  something  we  are  going
to have to develop anyway, or something that would be useful later
on? And did you consider that?

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  Our  committee  did  not  consider  that  in  depth.
I  will  ask  Mr.  Rothenberg  if  he  has  any  further  comments,  if  I
might. But the Committee did not consider that in depth. The Com-
mittee  did  have  the  feeling,  and  I  also  have  the  personal  belief,
that  when  one  does  the  Human  Exploration  Initiative,  and  con-
tinues moving humans to the Moon and possibly to Mars, that one
will  have  a  very  different  model  for  robotic  exploration.  One  will
not  have  the  model  of  a  non-cooperative  target  that  was  not  de-
signed for robotic servicing, which is the case with Hubble. And so
it would—anything that we launch into space that we want to serv-
ice robotically, and I am sure that we as a nation and internation-
ally will want to do so, we will design that from the start with that
in  mind.  Hubble  is  not  designed  for  robotic  servicing.  There  have
been many experiences that we have had with servicing Hubble by
astronauts,  where  unforeseen  things  have  been  found  on  Hubble.
When they have pulled out instrument racks to replace them, they
found  a  blanket  in  place  that  wasn’t  expected  from  the  CADCAM
drawings,  and  the  astronauts  could  handle  that.  When  one—if
one—presumably, one would design a robotic mission from scratch,
so that you wouldn’t have such things like that arise. And so, that
is—those  are  some  of  the  kind  of  issues  and  experiences  from  the
Shuttle servicing program that one has with this uncooperative tar-
get  that  wasn’t  designed  in  this  way,  that  formed  an  important
part of our committee’s deliberations.

gard?

Joe,  would  you  like  to  make  any  further  comments  in  this  re-

Mr. ROTHENBERG. Just one little, further to illustrate it. The un-
cooperative  target  is  one  piece.  The  second  is  the  actual  design  of
the vehicle in general. For example, there is multiple sockets need-
ed  to  be  carried  up  for  the  robot  to  pick  up  and  address  multiple
bolts  in  order  to  do  the  servicing.  If  one  were  designed  for  robotic
servicing  in  the  future,  and  even  with  humans,  this  became  dif-
ficult, but one designed for robotic servicing, you would have all of
the  same  bolt  sizes,  or  have  a  minimum  number  of  different  bolt
sizes,  such  that  there  is  a  minimum  number  of  motions  needed  to
get  another  socket,  bring  it  up,  and  put  it  on  the  robot,  put  it  on
the nut you are particularly trying to loosen. So, you would design
the vehicle differently, and I think that is a lesson we learned from
even  the  human  servicing  of  Hubble,  where  we  had  to  carry  up  a

tool  suite  far  beyond  what  would  normally  be  expected  if  you  de-
signed it for completely servicing.

Mr.  SODREL.  So,  just  to  follow,  then  this  is  apt  to  be  expense
rather than an investment. It is a one time expense, not something
that we would very likely use in the future.

Dr.  LANZEROTTI.  I  am  not—you  mean,  the  servicing  of  Hubble?
Mr. SODREL. Yes. I mean the robotics involved——
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Oh, the robotics.
Mr. SODREL.—in Hubble.
Dr. LANZEROTTI. Joe?
Mr.  ROTHENBERG.  No.  Clearly,  we  will  learn  something.  I  mean,
as we go through it, we are going to learn something of value. That
is not the point. I think it would be—the question is, is the invest-
ment,  if  we  were  only  doing  it  to  learn  what  it  took  to  do  explo-
ration, the right investment, or would you do it in a different way,
such as using the Dexter on the Space Station and designing some
targets  and  opportunities  to  test  actually  as  you  would  design  in
the future, and buy down the risk of future designs.

Mr. SODREL. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, and thank all of you
very much for indulging us, and going a little bit beyond the witch-
ing  hour.  We  will  follow  up  with  some  things  in  writing,  and  I
would  urge  you,  if  you  feel  that  there  is  something  more,  in  view
of  what  took  place  this  morning,  that  we  should  consider,  please
supplement your responses to our written questions with any addi-
tional comments you might care to make.

But thank you once again. Hearing adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Louis J. Lanzerotti, Chair, Committee on Assessment of Options to Ex-
tend the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope, National Research Council, The Na-
tional Academies

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. You said at the hearing that having a second Shuttle on an adjacent launch pad
ready  to  rescue  any  stranded  astronauts  in  an  emergency  is  not  a  prerequisite
for  sending  a  Hubble  servicing  mission.  Yet  NASA  has  told  the  Committee  re-
peatedly that, to provide a sufficient safety margin, a rescue Shuttle must be on
an  adjacent  launch  pad.  You  also  stated  that  General  Bolden  could  relate  past
times  when  NASA  has  had  two  Shuttles  on  the  launch  pad  simultaneously
(which  he  was  unfortunately  unable  to  do  before  the  end  of  the  hearing).  Yet
NASA  has  told  the  Committee  that  processing  two  missions  simultaneously
would be risky, highly complex, and would put an ‘‘unprecedented strain’’ on the
overall Shuttle system.

Q1a. What is your response to NASA’s assertions?
Q1b. When has NASA had two Shuttles on the launch pad simultaneously?
A1a & b. The CAIB did not require NASA to have a second Shuttle on an adjacent
launch  pad  and  ready  for  launch  to  rescue  stranded  astronauts  in  an  emergency,
nor did the CAIB require a ‘‘safe haven’’ capability. Both of these requirements were
established by NASA as its internal criteria for return to flight. The NRC committee
believes, as discussed in Chapter 6, p. 84, of its final report, that following the expe-
rience  of  flying  several  ISS  flights,  there  are  a  broad  range  of  options  for  imple-
menting a single HST servicing mission.

Two of these options would not require a Shuttle rescue mission or a safe haven.
Considerations  for  choosing  an  option  include  demonstrated  success  in  eliminating
debris during Shuttle ascent and the actual risk reduction provided by a rescue mis-
sion.  The  NRC  Committee  recognizes  that  the  ultimate  decision  on  implementing  a
HST  servicing  mission  is  the  responsibility  of  NASA.  However,  as  discussed  in
Chapter 6, p. 80, if NASA decided that an on-orbit crew rescue mission were needed,
then  a  Shuttle  HST  servicing  mission  would  require  the  on-pad  provision.  Imple-
mentation  of  a  pad  provision  on  a  single  HST  mission  was  deemed  manageable  by
the NRC Committee.

With  respect  to  NASA’s  concerns  that  processing  two  vehicles  simultaneously
‘‘. . .would be risky, highly complex, and would put an unprecedented strain on the
overall Shuttle system,’’ we note that NASA is currently processing two vehicles si-
multaneously  for  flights  STS–114  and  STS–121  and  historically  the  KSC  vehicle
processing  teams  have  always  had  two  or  three  vehicles  in  the  processing  flow  si-
multaneously  with  no  evidence  of  undo  strain  or  risk.  Actually  the  concern  is  for
conduct of simultaneous launch countdowns—that period from T minus 72 hours to
launch  (up  to  five  calendar  days).  This  concern  is  driven  by  the  required  JSC  mis-
sion control center reconfiguration for a second launch while simultaneously control-
ling  a  flight  in  progress.  NASA  also  expressed  concern  about  launch  crew  fatigue
and stress at the KSC from knowing that a launch delay of the rescue vehicle would
likely result in the loss of a stranded crew. While we accept these concerns as legiti-
mate,  they  will  also  be  present  for  any  rescue  mission  needed  to  the  ISS  (though
the  ISS  provides  some  additional  time  cushion  for  preparation).  Also,  we  believe
these concerns can be mitigated by focused management.

On  five  occasions  since  May  1995,  there  have  been  two  space  Shuttles  simulta-

neously in the launch flow on adjacent launch pads at the KSC as follows:

July 2001
Dec 1999
Oct 1995
July 1995
July 1995

STS–104 & STS–105
STS–103 & STS–99
STS–73 & STS–74
STS–70 & STS–69
STS–71 & STS–70

In  the  first  July  1995  case,  STS–70  was  actually  launched  16  days  after  the
launch of STS–71. The intervals between launches of STS–73 and STS–74 and STS–
104 and STS–105 were 23 and 29 days, respectively.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Your  committee’s  report  notes  that  NASA  has  only  committed  to  providing  a
‘‘safe  haven’’  capability  on  the  International  Space  Station  for  the  first  two
flights of the Space Shuttle after its return to flight. Your report also notes that
ISS  safe  haven  ‘‘has  significant  risks  due  to  its  limited  redundancy  and  mar-
gins.’’

Q1a. Please  elaborate  on  the  nature  of  the  risks,  and  identify  the  specific  changes
to  the  current  ISS  baseline  that  would  be  required  to  provide  a  credible  ‘‘safe
haven’’ capability on ISS for a combined ISS/Shuttle complement of 9–13 crew
members for whatever time would be required to deliver another Shuttle to the
ISS,  as  well  as  to  sustain  that  capability  through  the  completion  of  the  ISS
and retirement of the Shuttle, now scheduled for around 2010.

A1a. The concerns of the NRC Committee with respect to the risks inherent in the
ISS ‘‘safe haven’’ are related primarily to the ISS’s life support system. The life sup-
port system is currently certified for only three crew members, but after the delivery
of  the  additional  logistics  planned  for  the  LF1  manifest  (STS–114),  ISS  will  have
the  capability  to  accommodate  nine  crew  members  (two  ISS  and  seven  Shuttle).
However  due  to  the  lack  of  redundancy  this  capability  would  not  be  considered  ro-
bust.  Since  our  report  was  issued,  the  Space  Station  Program  (SSP)  has  accom-
plished  several  engineering  reassessments  and  has  taken  action  to  modify  the  LF1
manifest  to  provide  the  necessary  logistics  to  accommodate  an  ISS  crew  of  nine.  A
spare ISS Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) with spare parts, spare power
cables  for  response  capabilities  for  electrical  failures,  extra  stowage  bags  to  maxi-
mize collection and storage of orbiter-produced water while still docked to ISS, extra
Apollo  bags  for  contingency  human  waste  collection  after  the  orbiter  is  undocked,
along with other logistics provisions have all been added. The most recent SSP engi-
neering  assessment  has  created  three  ISS  scenarios  based  on  conceivable  failures
before  or  during  a  contingency  crew  stay.  The  first  scenario  (loss  of  CO2 removal
capability)  is  16  days  of  stay  time—very  similar  to  that  of  a  Shuttle  orbiter  at  the
HST.  The  second  scenario  (loss  of  O2 generation  capability)  is  45  days  stay  time.
And the third scenario (exhaustion of onboard water) is 70 days stay time.

Another  NRC  Committee  concern  about  reliance  on  ISS  as  a  ‘‘safe  haven’’  is  that
such  reliance  assumes  that  the  damage  to  the  orbiter  (or  any  other  failure)  would
not  prevent  it  from  achieving  ISS  orbit  and  docking.  In  fact,  as  demonstrated  on
STS–51F  in  July  1985,  loss  of  an  engine  during  ascent  can  result  in  a  lower-than-
desired orbit from which the ISS cannot be reached. In such an eventuality, the or-
biter would become the ‘‘safe haven’’ and, for the planned case, the crew would have
18 days of stay time.

In summary, NASA has improved the ‘‘safe haven’’ posture of the ISS but Shuttle
failure  modes  do  exist  that  would  preempt  a  docking  with  the  ISS,  and  there  are
also  potential  failures  on-board  the  ISS  that  would  severely  limit  it  as  a  ‘‘safe
haven.’’
Q1b. If  NASA  decides  not  to  continue  to  provide  a  safe  haven  capability  on  the  ISS
after  the  first  few  Shuttle  flights—as  currently  appears  to  be  the  plan—would
there be any practical difference in rescue options available for a Shuttle head-
ed towards ISS and a Shuttle headed towards Hubble?

A1b. Should NASA decide not to provide a ‘‘safe haven’’ capability on the ISS after
the first few Shuttle flights, there is still a slight advantage in terms of rescue capa-
bility  for  a  flight  to  the  ISS  as  opposed  to  one  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  As
stated  in  our  committee  report,  Chapter  6,  p.  79,  and  during  our  testimony  to  the
Science  Committee,  we  agree  with  NASA  that  the  ISS  provides  the  preferred  place
to  be  in  the  event  that  the  crew  survives  but  the  orbiter  damage  is  severe  enough
to  result  in  an  unrecoverable  vehicle.  The  ISS  would  afford  additional  time  for  a
stranded  crew  over  a  stand-alone  orbiter  and,  therefore,  increases  the  likelihood
that a rescue can be effected by contingency means. We also agree with the current
SSP  assessment  that,  by  the  time  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  is  flown,  NASA  will
have  successfully  demonstrated  that  it  fully  understands  and  has  solved  the  prob-
lem  of  debris  from  non-MMOD1  causes  and  that  therefore  the  requirement  for  a
‘‘safe haven’’ capability will have been reduced considerably.
Q2. It  has  been  asserted  that  the  National  Academies’  suggestion  that  the  Shuttle
could be maintained on orbit for 30 days while awaiting rescue does not address
the  issue  of  whether  it  would  be  possible  to  sustain  the  crew’s  lives  for  that  pe-
riod of time. How do you respond?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:15 Sep 20, 2005 Jkt 098396 PO 00000 Frm 00139 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020205\98396 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

A2. The committee naturally uses the term ‘‘safe haven’’ only to refer to a situation
in which the crew’s lives can be sustained. As stated in Chapter 6, p. 80, of the NRC
report, the Shuttle provides a ‘‘safe haven’’ for the astronauts of between 17 and 30
days,  depending  on  when  an  extreme  power-down  is  done.  If  the  full  planned
timeline  for  inspection,  data  processing  and  decision  making  is  used,  SSP  analysis
shows that 18 days are available. The NRC committee believes that the decision can
be made earlier for some scenarios, thereby increasing the time on orbit.
Q3. It  has  been  asserted  that  a  Hubble  servicing  mission  would  not  have  a  trans-
Atlantic  abort  site  available  to  it.  Is  that  correct,  and  if  so,  how  would  you  ad-
dress that concern?

A3. There has been misunderstanding of the trans-Atlantic landing abort site (TAL)
capability  as  it  relates  to  a  Hubble  servicing  mission.  A  Shuttle  mission  to  Hubble
actually  has  excess  ascent  performance,  due  to  the  relatively  light  weight  and  due
East  launch  profile  of  the  orbiter.  This  actually  results  in  an  overlap  of  the  return
to launch site (RTLS) and abort to orbit (AOA) regions, therefore negating the need
for a TAL capability. Nevertheless, should the SSP choose to insert a TAL capability
in the software for a Hubble servicing mission, the runway at Moron, Spain, is still
available for use in a TAL capability.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Some have argued that there is a large backlog of existing Hubble data waiting
to be analyzed, and thus there would be little impact on science if Hubble ceased
operations today. Do you agree or disagree?

A1. This  question  refers  to  the  large  body  of  data  known  as  the  Hubble  Archive.
The Hubble Archive is an invaluable science resource and exists because of the na-
ture of Hubble data acquisition and the timely analysis and publication of the data.
However,  the  word  ‘‘backlog,’’  is  sometimes  misunderstood  in  the  context  of  the  ar-
chive.  It  implies  that  analysis  of  Hubble  data  has  somehow  not  ‘‘kept  up’’  with  ob-
servations, so that observations have ‘‘gotten out in front’’ of analysis and therefore
observations  might  be  stopped  with  no  penalty  in  order  to  let  analysis  ‘‘catch  up.’’
This is not the case. In each proposal for new observations, the proposers must list
all  the  previous  proposals  they  have  submitted  and  the  status  of  the  data  analysis.
Unproductive proposers (those who have received data but have not analyzed them)
are  screened  out  of  the  system.  Proposers  are  aware  that  their  past  performance
will  be  scrutinized.  Since  competition  to  gain  time  on  Hubble  is  more  intense  than
for  any  other  telescope  in  the  world,  and  because  Hubble  science  is  in  itself  highly
competitive with multiple teams studying the same problem from different perspec-
tives,  Hubble  users  as  a  group  move  with  exceptional  rapidity  to  get  their  results
out  and  published  in  a  timely  manner.  This  is  one  reason  that  Hubble  productivity
in  terms  of  number  of  papers  published  and  number  of  citations  to  those  papers  is
by far the highest of any telescope in the world.

However, once data have been analyzed for their original purpose, that is not the
end  of  the  data’s  usefulness—frequently  the  data  can  reanalyzed  for  another  sci-
entific purpose. It is in this second stage that the Hubble Archive plays a scientific
role,  to  serve  as  a  repository  to  store  the  data  but  also  as  a  powerful  search  tool
to  identify  and  create  entirely  new  collections  of  data  (such  archives  are  associated
with  other  major  telescope  facilities  as  well  and  have  proven  essential  in  the
achievement of new understandings as time passes and ideas and theories change).
The reasons for reanalysis take two forms. First, it is a rare proposal that manages
to  observe  all  possible  astronomical  targets  that  are  relevant  to  the  subject.  That
would  take  too  much  time.  Rather,  the  proposer  singles  out  the  minimum  number
of  objects  that  will  suffice  to  answer  the  precise  question  posed.  Meanwhile,  other
proposers  will  have  looked  at  other  targets  in  the  same  family,  for  similar  reasons
or  perhaps  for  completely  different  reasons.  Thus,  as  time  goes  by,  the  collections
of  data  that  are  available  for  studying  any  given  problem  are  continually  growing.
This growth in numbers makes it possible to detect very subtle trends that are visi-
ble  only  with  a  very  large  number  of  objects.  The  process  is  analogous  to  sampling
the population of the United States in a census.

If  the  sample  is  tiny,  say  ten  people,  one  might  learn  only  that  roughly  half  the
population  is  male  and  half  is  female.  With  a  million  people  (carefully  selected  to
be  representative)  one  could  learn  much  more,  such  as  the  age  distribution,  coun-
tries  of  origin,  employment  figures,  etc.  In  the  same  manner,  the  growing  richness
of  the  Hubble  archive  is  enabling  more  and  more  precise  questions  to  be  asked  as
the  number  of  objects  of  a  given  type  (stars,  galaxies,  star  clusters,  etc.)  increases
from a few, to several dozen, and now in some cases to several hundreds of objects.

The  second  reason  for  the  scientific  importance  of  the  Archive  is  that  a  typical  ob-
servation usually contains much more information than was needed by the original
proposers. For example, every image that is taken contains superimposed objects in
the  background  or  foreground  along  the  same  line  of  sight.  Likewise,  nearly  every
spectrum  contains  dozens  or  hundreds  of  spectral  features  in  addition  to  the  ones
that were originally targeted. This richness encourages scientists to go ‘‘back to the
well’’ many times in order to draw every last bit of interesting science from the data.
This process is vast and will continue for many years after Hubble has stopped oper-
ating.

The response above leads to the second half of the question, which is whether the
process of data acquisition has continued long enough and the collected samples are
now sufficiently large. The answer is in fact no, for several reasons:

• The  universe  is  constantly  changing,  and  there  are  many  classes  of  objects
that  are  time-variable.  Hubble  is  still  collecting  time-series  data  on  many
such classes of objects.

• As  a  telescope  with  incredibly  broad  applications,  Hubble  is  needed  to  work
synergistically with other NASA observatories. Hubble sees nearly all objects
in  the  Universe  within  reach  of  these  other  observatories,  and  Hubble  is  the
telescope  that  gives  the  highest-resolution  picture  showing  fine  details.  As  a
result,  a  very  large  fraction  of  the  proposals  received  for  time  on  Hubble  are
being  driven  by  interesting  new  results  from  other  spacecraft  that  now  need
Hubble  follow-up  for  proper  interpretation.  Hubble  is  working  cooperatively
with  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory,  the  Spitzer  Infrared  Observatory,  the
GALEX  Ultraviolet  Explorer,  and  the  Swift  Gamma-Ray  Observatory.  These
observatories  are  all  much  younger  than  Hubble,  and  many  results  are  com-
ing  in  for  the  first  time,  inspiring  new  Hubble  projects.  For  example,  Swift
just launched last November 20, 2004.

• The  larger  field  of  view  of  the  ACS  camera,  installed  in  2002,  enabled  real
surveys to be taken for the first time by Hubble, covering nearby galaxies and
star  clusters  that  were  formerly  too  big  for  Hubble  and  enabling  maps  to  be
made of much larger portions of the distant Universe. Demand for these larg-
er surveys has not yet abated.

• Most  important  of  all,  the  SM–4  servicing  mission  would  install  two  new  in-
struments  on  Hubble.  Each  time  new  instruments  have  been  installed,  there
is  a  burgeoning  of  new  ideas  to  explore  with  them.  This  time  will  be  no  dif-
ferent. One of the new instruments is a combined ultraviolet/infrared camera
that will take images 10–50 times faster at UV and IR wavelengths than the
older cameras. The second new instrument is an ultraviolet spectrograph that
is faster by a comparable factor. These enhanced capabilities will enable huge
gains  in  understanding.  Together,  these  two  instruments  will  essentially  re-
make the Hubble observatory, for the fourth time in its history.

Q2. How  should  we  view  Hubble—and  more  broadly,  space  science  as  a  whole—in

the context of the President’s space exploration vision?

A2. The  gains  in  knowledge  made  possible  by  Hubble  strongly  support-in  fact  en-
able—the  President’s  space  exploration  vision.  Hubble  is  about  exploring:  exploring
the  vast  universe  in  which  humanity  resides.  NASA  has  been,  since  its  beginning,
an  agency  that  inspired—on  a  broad  variety  of  fronts  and  in  a  broad  variety  of
ways—by:

• Instilling  admiration  for  American  technology  by  conducting  a  dazzling  and

daring program of firsts in space exploration.

• Fostering  the  image  of  America  as  a  capable,  can-do  society  that  is  willing

to take on and conquer the most difficult challenges.

• Educating  and  inspiring  America  and  the  world  about  the  colossal  cosmic
processes that gave rise to Earth, created life, and ultimately created human
beings.

• Unveiling our species’ cosmic history and, in so doing, laying key foundational

knowledge for shaping our cosmic future.

Historically,  the  strategy  used  by  NASA  to  execute  this  larger  mission  has  been

a highly successful two-pronged strategy of ‘‘exploration’’:

• Exploration of the Solar System by humans, and
• Exploration of the Solar System (and the Universe beyond) by remotely oper-

ated observatories and landers.

138

Remotely  operated  craft  complete  the  exploration  program  by  carrying  sensors
that far outstrip human vision and by going places that humans cannot go, and the
next  generation  of  ‘‘space  robots’’  will  simply  be  the  next  step  in  NASA’s  long-term
program of substituting machines for people, when appropriate.

The  United  States  space  program  is  an  integrated  whole:  people  plus  machines
exploring space from the edge of the Earth to the edge of the Universe. It is incon-
ceivable  to  envision  a  programmatically-whole  NASA  that  does  not  pursue  explo-
ration  vigorously,  via  both  human  space  flight  and  remotely  operated  space-
craft. . .and explores not just within the Solar System but also beyond.

Viewed in this context, the Hubble Telescope repair (together with the broad suite
of  other  exciting  scientific  missions  in  flight  and  in  planning  makes  perfect  pro-
grammatic sense. While vigorously pursuing the Exploration Vision the agency must
maintain  its  current  bold  and  creative  leadership  in  robotic  exploration,  from  the
Earth  to  the  Sun,  the  planets,  and  the  distant  universe.  Hubble—the  world’s  most
powerful observatory with gold-plated scientific credentials coupled with high name
recognition and widespread public support—fits admirably into this vision.

In  repairing  Hubble,  the  human  and  remote-spacecraft  arms  of  the  NASA  pro-
gram  come  together  synergistically  to  achieve  a  goal  that  neither  could  achieve
alone.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Joseph  H.  Taylor,  Jr.,  Co-Chair,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Survey

Committee, National Research Council, The National Academies

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Should  Hubble  operations  cease  in  the  next  two  to  four  years,  what  will  be  its
impact  to  the  community  of  scientists  since,  as  you  point  out,  one-third  of  all
funding for astronomy is tied to Hubble?

Q1a. What will be its impact on the training of the next generation of scientists?
Q1b. How  could  the  impact  on  Hubble  scientists  be  minimized  if  no  servicing  mis-

sion were to occur?

A1a  &  b. If  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  becomes  inoperative  well  before  a
replacement  is  available,  graduate  students,  post-doctoral  trainees,  and  their  men-
tors will lose one of the most important sources of astronomical information. Syner-
gistic  multi-wavelength  results  obtained  nearly  simultaneously  with  the  HST  and
with  Chandra,  Spitzer,  and  ground-based  facilities  including  the  Very  Large  Tele-
scope and the Keck Telescopes will become impossible for some years; students will
gravitate to other fields, and US momentum and leadership will suffer.

I believe it would be unwise, and surely a false economy, not to proceed with the
planned SM–4 Shuttle servicing mission soon after the Shuttle returns to flight. But
if for some reason the servicing cannot be accomplished, NASA should look for other
ways to maintain its enviable and well deserved reputation for scientific leadership.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. You chaired the most recent Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
Q1a. What  did  that  Survey  assume  regarding  an  SM–4  Hubble  servicing  mission?
Q1b. Was it among the ‘‘pre-requisites’’ assumed by the Survey?
A1a  &  b. The  Survey  took  it  as  given  that  NASA  would  proceed  with  its  plans  to
keep  HST  in  good  operating  condition,  most  likely  until  (or  nearly  until)  the  Next
Generation Space Telescope is in orbit and operational.
Q2. Did  NASA  ask  any  of  the  relevant  National  Academies  committees  or  other  ap-
propriate  representatives  of  the  scientific  community  for  input  prior  to  its  deci-
sion last year not to service Hubble?

A2. As far as I know, they did not.
Q3. If the commitment made by NASA Administrator O’Keefe to Congress to ‘‘grand-
father in’’ the SM–4 Shuttle servicing mission to Hubble in the wake of NASA’s
shift  in  its  Shuttle  accounting  approach  is  preserved,  and  thus  the  Shuttle-re-
lated costs of the servicing mission are not imposed on NASA’s science program,
Q3a. Would  you  consider  having  NASA’s  science  program  pay  the  science-related
costs  of  the  servicing  mission  (estimated  to  be  $300–370  million)  to  be  con-
sistent with the assumptions of the Decadal Survey?

Q3b. Would  you  favor  an  SM–4  Shuttle  servicing  mission  to  Hubble  if  NASA’s

above-mentioned commitment to Congress is maintained?

A3a & b. I do not recall that funding details of the planned servicing mission were
explicitly discussed by the Survey Committee. We were told that the necessary serv-
icing missions were ‘‘in the budget.’’

I am definitely in favor of an SM–4 Shuttle servicing mission, as soon as possible
after  the  Shuttle  returns  to  flight.  If  the  stated  commitment  to  Congress  is  main-
tained, there should be no adverse effect on other NASA science goals recommended
by the Decadal Survey.

Question submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Dr. Taylor, your testimony mentioned the importance of concurrent science oper-
ations  by  Hubble,  the  Spitzer  Great  Observatory,  and  the  Chandra  Great  Ob-
servatory.

Q1a. Would you please explain why that synergy is important for researchers?

A1a. Many  of  the  astronomical  phenomena  in  question  are  variable  on  time  scales
from  days  to  years.  Much  of  the  potential  of  the  Chandra  Great  Observatory,  espe-
cially,  will  be  lost  if  simultaneous  (or  nearly  simultaneous)  observations  are  not
available from HST over its working lifetime.

In  addition,  it  frequently  occurs  that  important  astronomical  targets  are  first
identified  in  one  wavelength  region,  and  then  studied  even  more  effectively  in  an-
other  part  of  the  spectrum.  For  that  reason,  the  rate  of  discovery  increases  even
more  than  proportionally  when  concurrent  science  operations  are  possible  over  a
wide wavelength range.

Responses by Steven V.W. Beckwith, Director, Space Telescope Science Institute

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. At the current rate that Hubble data are studied, for how many months or years
would astronomers still be analyzing new data if the Hubble telescope ceased op-
erations  today?  Is  the  backlog  of  data  sufficient  to  fill  any  gap  between  Hubble
operations and those of the James Webb Space Telescope?

A1. The  archival  program  is  about  13  percent  of  the  total  research  program  on
Hubble.  If  new  observations  were  not  possible,  and  we  funded  archival  research  at
the  same  rate  as  new  observations,  all  of  the  useful  data  analysis  would  be  done
in  about  one  year.  Of  course,  Hubble  data  will  be  used  for  archival  purposes  for
many years to come but mostly as ancillary data to support new information coming
from operating observatories.

Currently, the Webb telescope is scheduled for launch in 2011, meaning the actual
gap would be six years, if Hubble operations ceased today. I do not believe archival
research  will  adequately  bridge  the  gap  to  the  launch  of  the  Webb  telescope,  if
Hubble operations cease early.

Most  of  the  archival  programs  rely  on  data  that  is  only  a  few  years  old.  If  there
were no more new data, we would expect even the reduced demand for archival re-
search to wane over a four-year period, say.

It  is  also  important  to  realize  that  newly  targeted  Hubble  observations  conduct
quite  different  type  scientific  investigations  than  archival  research;  the  two  are  not
interchangeable  avenues  to  discovery.  Hubble  observes  only  a  tiny  area  of  the  sky;
it is a pointed telescope as opposed to a survey telescope. It typically gathers unique
data on an object already known to be interesting, and the initial investigations get
most of the scientific value in the first publications. These very small regions of the
sky  in  the  Hubble  archive  represent  a  minuscule  section  of  the  Universe.  While
well-suited to continuing investigations of the original peculiar object that motivated
the data, they are generally not useful for random, unexpected discoveries.

Hubble  is  just  now  beginning  to  make  major  surveys  that  will  serve  as  a  legacy
for  the  future,  but  these  will  not  be  completed  if  the  Hubble  mission  ends  early,
thus depriving astronomers of the most valuable archival data they anticipate.
Q2. Should  Hubble  operations  cease  in  the  next  two  to  four  years,  what  will  be  its
impact  to  the  community  of  scientists  since,  as  Dr.  Taylor  points  out,  one-third
of  all  funding  for  astronomy  is  tied  to  Hubble?  What  will  be  its  impact  on  the
training  of  the  next  generation  of  scientists?  How  could  the  impact  on  Hubble
scientists be minimized if no servicing mission were to occur?

A2. The Hubble grants program provides approximately $24 million dollars per year
for astronomy, of which $3 million is the amount for archival research. The Hubble
program  does  support  almost  one-third  of  all  funding  for  astronomy.  When  Hubble
operations  cease,  funding  for  archival  research  on  Hubble  will  continue  to  support
research but at a dramatically reduced rate compared to the total now. It would rep-
resent a substantial loss to astronomy.

A  second  factor  is  Hubble’s  impact  in  motivating  ground-based  research.  Hubble
programs  stimulate  substantial  uses  of  our  nation’s  ground-based  facilities  such  as
the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo) and the
international  Gemini  project.  If  Hubble  ceased  operations,  many  of  those  Hubble-
generated  programs  and  the  training  they  provide  to  graduate  students  would  dis-
appear.

Questions  submitted  by  Representative  Bart  Gordon  on  behalf  of  Rep-

resentative Mark Udall

Q1. Some have argued that there is a massive backlog of existing Hubble data wait-
ing  to  be  analyzed,  and  thus  there  would  be  little  impact  on  science  if  Hubble
ceased operations today. Do you agree or disagree?

A1. I  disagree  with  the  assertion  that  there  would  be  little  impact  on  science  if
Hubble  ceased  operations  today.  My  analysis  of  our  archival  program  presented
above  indicates  that  the  backlog  of  data  would  take  the  equivalent  of  one  year  to
analyze at the present rate of funding for Hubble research; we could envision fund-
ing  archival  research  for  a  much  longer  period,  of  course,  but  at  a  reduced  rate  of
expenditure.  Even  if  we  relaxed  our  standards  for  selecting  archival  research  pro-

142

grams,  we  could  not  credibly  support  a  scientifically  compelling  program  for  more
than  two  years  at  the  same  rate  as  we  now  support  new  observational  programs.
As  I  have  noted  previously,  archival  research  and  new  Hubble  observations  are
not  interchangeable,  nor  equally  suited  to  important  discoveries.  The  former  gen-
erally  extends  our  knowledge  of  complex  problems  in  an  important  way,  but  it  is
the latter that most often leads to unexpected and ground-breaking discoveries.
Q2. You  chaired  one  of  the  Decadal  Survey  panels  that  looked  at  Hubble  and  the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Please describe how your panel prioritized
Hubble relative to JWST.

A2. Our  panel  was  given  the  task  of  ranking  the  top  priorities  for  space  research
at wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared in the decade from 2001 to 2010.
NASA’s  plan  for  that  period  contained  two  important  assumptions  that  aided  our
work:

a) The Hubble Space Telescope would be serviced at least two more times (SM–

3 and SM–4) and kept operational until 2010.

b) The  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  (called  the  Next  Generation  Space  Tele-

scope at that time) would be launched in 2007.

Those  were  two  crucial  assumptions  that  allowed  us  to  assign  priorities.  We  ex-
pected Hubble to remain operational with planned instrument upgrades throughout
the  decade  we  were  assigned  to  study.  Therefore,  we  decided  not  to  rank  it  in  our
priority  list.  Our  reasoning  was  that  any  extension  of  its  life  beyond  2010  could  be
debated  in  the  second  half  of  the  decade,  when  we  got  to  see  how  new  programs
developed and how Hubble compared. A servicing mission could be carried out with
only  a  few  years  lead  time,  making  it  unnecessary  to  consider  Hubble  right  away.
The James Webb Space Telescope was scheduled for launch in 2007. There would,
therefore,  be  a  three-  to  four-year  overlap  between  Hubble  and  Webb.  If  Webb
achieved  all  its  objectives,  the  pressure  to  continue  Hubble  might  be  greatly  re-
duced.  If  the  capabilities  of  Webb  were  greatly  curtailed,  or  if  a  failure  limited  its
life, there would still be time to consider life extension for Hubble.

Unfortunately,  the  launch  date  of  the  Webb  telescope  has  now  slipped  beyond
2010,  and  NASA  is  considering  an  end  to  the  Hubble  mission  in  2007  or  2008.  I
believe our panel would have looked at the priorities differently under this changed
set  of  circumstances,  and  we  would  likely  have  made  a  strong  statement  about
Hubble science given the impending gap that we see now.

The  importance  of  Hubble  science  in  this  decade  was  recently  reaffirmed  by  two,
high-level committees who examined the question: The HST–JWST Transition Plan
Review Panel (NASA), chaired by John Bahcall, and The Committee on the Assess-
ment  of  Options  for  Extending  the  Life  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (NRC)
chaired by Louis Lanzerotti. Both committees strongly endorsed the scientific impor-
tance of servicing Hubble a fifth time through SM–4.
Q3. If  Congress  or  a  new  NASA  Administrator  decides  to  reinstate  a  Shuttle  serv-
icing  mission  to  Hubble,  what  civil  service  and  contractor  workforce  will  be  re-
quired  to  complete  the  mission  within  the  required  timetable,  and  how  soon  be-
fore  the  mission  will  they  need  to  be  in  place?  Is  that  workforce  currently  in
place?

A3. It  takes  about  two  years  to  prepare  for  a  servicing  mission  to  Hubble,  if  the
experienced  teams  are  available.  The  good  news  is  that  the  workforce  is  largely  in
place  to  support  a  Shuttle  servicing  mission,  including  people  at  Goddard  Space
Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, the contractor teams, and the Space Telescope
Science  Institute.  Many  of  the  critical  government  and  contractor  personnel  are
working towards a robotic servicing mission. Some additional people would be need-
ed to support documentation for a Shuttle mission at Goddard Space Flight Center,
but I believe they could be added relatively easily.

It  is  vitally  important  that  this  workforce  remain  in  place  while  the  debate  on
Hubble’s  future  continues.  If  we  lose  the  key  engineering  and  technical  talent  with
decades  of  experience  on  Shuttle-based  Hubble  servicing,  it  will  be  very  difficult  to
replace.  Fortunately,  key  people  at  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center,  on  the  contractor
teams,  and  at  the  Space  Telescope  Science  Institute  are  still  part  of  the  Hubble
team  and  will  remain  part  of  the  team  as  long  as  they  are  supported  and  there  is
a realistic hope for Hubble servicing in the near future.
Q4. What fraction of the science-related costs (i.e., non-Shuttle-related costs) have al-
ready been incurred in preparing for the SM–4 servicing mission? What remains
to be done if the SM–4 servicing mission is reinstated?

A4. In round numbers, we have invested approximately $250 million in new instru-
ments and replacement parts for SM–4. The costs to NASA space science of a serv-
icing  mission  are  typically  $300  to  $400  million  spread  over  the  next  three  years.
By this calculation, most of the money for SM–4 has already been spent.

However, the delays to SM–4 following the Columbia tragedy mean that the tech-
nical workforce will have to be supported for another three years to service Hubble.
That  three  year  delay  will  mean  an  additional  $360  million  for  workforce  support.
Q5. How many requests for observing time on Hubble do you receive annually? What
percent  of  those  requests  can  be  accommodated?  Has  the  demand  for  observing
time on Hubble changed over the years?

A5. The demand for telescope time in a single year is approximately six times that
amount  of  time  available.  That  demand  has  been  steady  for  approximately  the  last
eight  years.  We  experienced  a  drop  of  about  25  percent  this  year  following  the  fail-
ure of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) in July, 2004. Even without
STIS,  the  demand  for  time  in  the  most  recent  year  exceeded  the  available  time  by
a  factor  of  4.7.  To  place  this  value  in  perspective,  it  is  a  greater  over-subscription
ratio than that of any other NASA observatory, past or present. The scientific qual-
ity of the proposals continues to be outstanding, and we will be turning down many
proposals that are scientifically compelling.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. You seem to argue that many aspects of a robotics servicing mission are not new
and therefore can be done more easily and quickly than the Aerospace Corpora-
tion  and  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  believe.  But  on  the  other  hand,  you
argue that a robotic servicing mission is a critical opportunity to drive the devel-
opment  of  robotic  capabilities  in  space.  How  do  you  reconcile  these  seemingly
contradictory arguments?

A1.
Stepping Stone to the Future

Although  the  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  mission  will  not  involve  designing  and
building  any  radically  new  technology,  the  mission  will  involve  deploying  and  oper-
ating  technology  building  blocks  in  new  ways,  in  new  combinations,  or  for  the  first
time.

The  key  thing  to  understand  in  this  regard  is  that  the  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing
mission  is  the  next  natural  step  in  the  gradual  development  and  proving  out  of  a
set  of  capabilities  that  are  crucial  for  the  future—for  the  future  of  affordable  space
science missions, for the future of DOD space missions, and for the future of human
and robotic exploration missions.

As  such,  the  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  Mission  really  will  serve  as  ‘‘a  critical  op-
portunity  to  drive  the  development  of  robotic  capabilities  in  space,’’  while  incurring
the least possible additional operational or mission risk.

Let me explain.
An  existing  ‘‘mind-barrier’’  that  NASA  Architects  currently  face  is  to  assume  or
not  assume  that  they  can  count  on  remote  robotic  capabilities  to  conduct  complex
assembly  and  servicing  tasks  for  future  missions,  which  could  impact  the  direction
of NASA investment and development to support such missions. The fact of the mat-
ter is that even though all the key building blocks for the Hubble Robotic Servicing
Mission already exists or have been flown, no one has yet been given an opportunity
to  put  them  together  and  demonstrate  such  a  mission  capability  in  an  integrated
fashion.  The  Hubble  Robotic  Servicing  Mission  would  enable  NASA  Architects  to
plan  differently  (when  they  can  start  counting  on  similar  robotics  capabilities)  and
potentially save billions of dollars by not having to solely rely on astronauts all the
time to undertake any remote assembly and servicing tasks, or have to develop very
large  launchers  (only)  to  accommodate  future  large  integrated  space  infrastructure.
Furthermore,  the  additional  benefits  to  DOD  Space  Applications  (as  has  been  sug-
gested  by  several  Congressional  members  at  the  Hearing)  are  also  expected  to  be
very significant.

Future  Space  Programs  will  undoubtedly  need  to  maximize  sustainable  afford-
ability,  maximize  safety  and  improve  mission  success  effectiveness.  Hence  it  is
worth  underlining  the  value  of  what  will  be  achieved  with  an  operational  proof  of
servicing the Hubble:

For  astronaut  safety:  Hubble  robotic  servicing  will  show  that  an  alternative  to
risking  astronaut  lives  exists,  particularly  for  addressing  future  servicing  and
other  mission  requirements  that  are  intrinsically  mundane  (e.g.,  changing  bat-
teries) or don’t require astronaut talents.
For  space  science:  A  future  of  affordably  upgradeable  and  serviceable  large  in-
struments.
For  DOD:  Affordable  assembly  and  servicing  of  large  national  assets  in  orbit.
For  Exploration:  The  robotic  assembly  of  human-support  infrastructure  in  ad-
vance  of  the  human  occupation,  e.g.,  at  Lagrange  points,  on  the  lunar  surface.
An affordable alternative to very heavy lift capability, e.g., the robotic assembly
in orbit of multi-piece spacecraft, where each piece is launched with smaller and
much cheaper launchers.

Aerospace Corporation and NAS Reports

Both the Aerospace Corporation and the National Academy of Sciences reports ap-
peared  to  have  based  much  of  their  technical/risks  assessments  for  the  Hubble
Robotic  Servicing  Program  on  ‘‘starting  from  scratch’’  assumptions.  Their  conclu-
sions  were  significantly  higher  than  the  baseline  Program  because  the  Program
started  from  technology  and  hardware  already  available.  For  example,  many  of  the

simulators  already  exist.  The  existing  SPDM  robot  is  being  transferred  from  ISS
(later to be replaced). The RMS End Effector is a flown spare from the Shuttle Pro-
gram.  The  Propulsion  Module  hardware  is  from  the  X–38  canceled  program.  The
main rendezvous Lidar sensor is a duplicate of the one to be launched on the AFRL
XSS–11 Program by Spring 2005. The unmanned robotic control capability has been
qualified for DARPA’s Orbital Express Program and will be launched in 2006. Also,
flight software for HST exists and would be easily modified. The Ground Station for
HST already exists and is in use and, most important of all, there are over 500 per-
sonnel  who  are  already  knowledgeable  and  experienced  in  servicing,  checking  out,
and  operating  HST.  There  is  very  little  technology  development  for  this  Program.
The  maximum  effort  will  be  expended  in  Systems  Engineering  Integration,  Testing
and Training.

None  of  these  factors  were  incorporated  into  the  Aerospace  Study  because  it  was
not  their  Charter  to  do  so.  The  Vice  President  of  Aerospace  Corporation  has  subse-
quently  gone  to  GSFC  (February  2005)  to  see  these  items  of  hardware  and  was
amazed  with  all  the  progress  made  and  the  elements  of  hardware  at  hand.  Simi-
larly, the NAS had only a four hour presentation on the Robotic Mission, and since
NASA  was  in  a  procurement  process  for  the  robot,  the  Committee  was  not  able  to
assess  the  maturity  of  the  hardware.  As  a  result,  they  had  to  depend  on  the  Aero-
space  Study  to  form  their  assessment.  Both  Aerospace  and  the  NAS  members  have
been  invited  to  the  NASA  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR),  March  21–25,  2005.
Q2. Several  comments  were  raised  during  the  hearing  regarding  risks  associated
with  the  grappling  arm  and  the  dexterous  robotic  arm,  but  there  was  little  dis-
cussion  about  other  risks  such  as  interfaces  and  autonomous  docking  with  an
uncooperative target. How serious are these risks, and what measures are being
taken to minimize them?

A2.
Other Risks

Some of the other risks associated with the Hubble Robotic Servicing mission are

summarized as follows:

Autonomous rendezvous. The Hubble mission will arrive on the heels of the grad-
ual  development  and  testing  out  of  rendezvous  technology  and  capabilities  that
started  originally  with  Apollo.  Most  immediately  prior  to  the  Hubble  mission  will
have  been  the  XSS–11  mission  (to  be  launched  in  April  2005),  the  DART  mission
(2005 launch), the Orbital Express mission (2006 launch), a Shuttle/ISS Rendezvous
DTO  Mission  (2006  launch).  These  missions  have  as  a  key  objective  the  continuing
improvement  and  testing  of  sensors  and  software  for  autonomous  rendezvous  and
proximity  operations.  The  Hubble  mission  will  use  similar  or  identical  rendezvous
and  proximity  operations  technology  components  from  the  same  suppliers.  The  de-
mands  of  the  Hubble  mission  may  be  marginally  more  difficult  or  complicated  that
the circumstances that will be tested out on the prior missions (e.g., possibly, in the
worst  case  scenario  in  which  Hubble  is  ‘‘tumbling,’’  although  even  in  this  case  the
rate of tumble would be actually very slow).

In  other  words,  the  technical  and  operational  risk  associated  with  autonomous
rendezvous technology and procedures is the smallest possible incremental step for-
ward,  but  since  the  Hubble  mission  will  be  an  operational  mission  and  not  a  dem-
onstration  mission  like  its  predecessors,  the  Hubble  mission  will  nonetheless  serve
as a critical opportunity for advancement.

Unmanned  capture.  The  Hubble  mission  will  use  its  grapple  arm  to  perform  the
final  capture  and  berthing  of  servicing  spacecraft  to  the  space  telescope.  Proven
predecessor procedures will include:

— the use of an essentially identical grapple arm (the Shuttle arm) to grab the
grapple fixture on the Hubble
• the  incremental  step  forward  is  astronaut  control  from  the  ground  in-

stead of the adjacent Shuttle

— ground  control  of  orbital  robotics  on  Space  Station  (demonstrated  February

2005)
• very similar to the Hubble requirements

— autonomous grapple-arm capture of a target vehicle in Orbital Express

• although  the  target  vehicle  is  designed  to  be  ‘‘cooperative,’’  in  some  way

(e.g., the grapple fixture with targets) so is the Hubble

In  summary,  although  the  unmanned  capture  of  the  Hubble  will  be  a  significant
operational  demonstration,  in  practice  it  represents  the  smallest  possible  step  for-
wards over prior operations and tests.

Dexterous  Servicing  with  Tools.  It  appears  that  the  schedule  requirements  of  the
Hubble  mission  will  require  Dextre’s  first  use  on-orbit  to  be  for  the  Hubble  rather
than  the  originally  planned  servicing  operations  on  the  Space  Station.  However,
even here there is or will have been important prior art, including:

— dexterous  robotic  servicing  operations  on  the  Orbital  Express  mission,  in-

cluding Orbital Replacement Unit swaps (e.g., like Wide Field Camera)
• incremental step forward is the use of the more capable Dextre, although

the principles and procedures will be similar

— Hubble servicing operations using tools, as performed by astronauts

• Incremental  step  is  having  Dextre’s  ‘‘hand’’  hold  and  operate  the  tools
(controlled  by  astronauts),  instead  of  having  the  astronaut  hold  the  tools
directly

— Hubble  robotic  servicing  operations,  using  high  fidelity  mockup  and  terres-

trial version of Dextre
• Each  and  every  necessary  operational  procedure  has  now  been  tested  on

the ground. The only thing left to do is fly the mission.

Again,  in  summary,  although  the  overall  achievement  of  robotically  servicing
Hubble  will  be  an  impressive  operational  step  forward,  we  see  that  nearly  all  the
prior  risk  mitigating  steps  that  can  be  imagined  will  have  in  fact  been  done,  and
that as a result the incremental risk has been minimized.
Risk Mitigation Approach

The overall Risk Mitigation Approach for the Mission has been developed from all
of  the  experienced  gained  from  satellite  servicing  missions—beginning  with  Solar
Max  Repair  Mission  in  1984  and  continuing  through  WESTAR/PALAPA,  Syncom
IV,  Intelsat,  and  then  the  four  Hubble  Repair  Missions.  Although  there  are  many
specific steps and test activities associated with the robotic servicing plan, it can be
boiled down into one single formula for mission success. This formula was employed
and maintained on the HST from the first mission through this specific mission and
it is: ‘‘Test, Test, and Retest. Train, Train, and Retrain.’’

Specifically dealing with the question of what will give us confidence that the me-
chanical  systems  (such  as  latches,  berthing,  pins  and  mechanisms)  will  fit  together
when  robotically  mated  in  space,  the  Project  will  test  all  mating  interfaces  with
Hubble  including  Berthing  and  Latching  robotic  interfaces  using  the  family  of  Hi
Fidelity  Mechanical  Simulators  in  the  GSFC  Test  Facility.  These  simulators  have
been  validated  to  be  accurate  by  virtue  of  the  four  previous  Servicing  Missions
whereby  each  of  the  Critical  Interfaces  were  employed.  Master  tooling  and  gages
have  been  revalidated  with  the  returned  hardware  from  space  on  each  of  the  four
Servicing  Missions.  The  Project  will  use  this  tooling  and  Hi  Fidelity  Simulators  to
check this system before shipment to KSC for launch.

In addition, to reduce the risk of Approach, Rendezvous, and Capture in the orbit
dynamics  and  day/night  aspects,  the  Project  is  teamed  with  MSFC  to  conduct  a  se-
ries  of  capture  Dynamics  Test,  Lighting  Tests,  and  Grapple  Tests.  MSFC  facilities
will  use  the  actual  flight  hardware  and  software  elements.  This  will  be  done  prior
to launch as a key part of our Risk Mitigation effort. With increasing degrees of so-
phistication,  these  types  of  tests  will  first  be  conducted  at  MDA,  then  GSFSC,  and
finally MSFC. In a similar manner, Approach and Rendezvous Sensors will be test-
ed on several earlier flights such as DART, XSS–11, and a Space Station DTO being
conducted  in  partnership  with  JSC.  Again,  these  tests  are  in  addition  to  tests  both
at  vendor’s  plants  and  GSFC.  The  consistent  philosophy  for  all  major  elements  of
the Mission is ‘‘Test, Test, and Retest.’’

Question submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. The  Goddard  robotic  servicing  project  assumes  that  the  entire  mission  (not  just
the robotics system) will be developed within 39 months in order to get to Hubble
before  it  fails.  That  would  imply  that  the  project  is  allowing  only  eight  months
after  the  robotic  system  is  scheduled  to  show  up  to  integrate  it  into  the  rest  of
the  spacecraft,  test  the  integrated  system  and  software,  and  prepare  the  entire
spacecraft for launch. Why do you believe that is sufficient time for such a com-
plex set of tasks?

A1. There  are  two  aspects  to  this  question  of  schedule.  The  first  aspect  deals  with
the question of hardware development and having ample Integration and Test time
in  a  39-month  program.  The  second  question  deals  with  the  expected  life  of  the

147

Hubble  Space  Telescope  and  the  related  question  that  if  the  development  cycle  is
delayed, will there be enough time to repair HST before its demise.

Dealing with the aspect of ample development Integration and Test time, the fol-
lowing  points  need  to  be  made.  The  major  Critical  Hardware  elements  selected  for
this Program already have been developed. In many cases, the hardware already ex-
ists  and  is  being  physically  transferred  to  the  Program.  Such  Critical  elements  as
the SPDM Robot, the Grapple Arm, the Grapple End Effector, the Scientific Instru-
ments,  the  X–38  Propulsion  Module,  many  software  elements  for  the  spacecraft
(coming from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Program), and components from the
Rapid  Spacecraft  Development  Program  have  been  selected  to  hasten  hardware
build. From an Integration and Test perspective, the Program has taken the lessons
learned  from  the  four  earlier  Hubble  Servicing  Missions,  and  especially  the  first
Hubble Servicing Mission—started and flown in less than 37 months.

The  key  to  all  these  past  missions,  including  aspects  of  the  Mars  Exploration
Rover  Mission  (36-month  development  and  flight  cycle)  and  the  Mars  Reconnais-
sance Orbiter Program, was the extensive use of ground test simulators. These sim-
ulators  are  used  for  all  elements  of  Integration  and  Testing  including  software  de-
velopment,  structural  dynamics,  guidance  and  navigation,  zero  G  testing  of  robotic
activities, etc.

The Program is now six months old, and many of these simulators have been com-
pleted  and  are  undergoing  checkout  at  GSFC  and  University  of  Maryland  Water
Tank.  Within  three  more  months,  these  simulators  will  be  used  to  check  out  flight
software,  guidance  and  navigation  algorithms,  flight  robotic  tools,  spacecraft  light-
ing,  operations  procedures,  spacecraft  harness  layouts,  etc.  Six  of  these  simulators
have  already  been  delivered  to  the  GSFC  I&T  Facility.  Through  the  use  of  these
simulations,  Integration  activities  will  start  in  the  next  eight  months,  giving  more
than an 18-month Integration and Test window before flight.

Dealing  with  this  issue  of  Hubble  life  on  orbit,  one  has  to  remember  that  there
are  two  elements  of  HST’s  life—Scientific  Operation  Life  Expectancy  and  then  the
Ultimate Safe Hold Life Expectancy. The Scientific Life Expectancy is driven by the
useful  life  of  the  gyroscopes  on  board  and  present  projections  are  about  mid-2008
for  loss  of  gyroscopic  precision  pointing.  After  that  the  spacecraft  can  be  put  in  a
standby (safe hold mode) for another 12 months, waiting for replacement hardware.
This  extra  12  months  is  estimated  by  current  battery  life  projections.  Up  to  that
point,  the  spacecraft  can  be  serviced  and  returned  to  full  science  operations  as  was
done on HST Servicing Mission 3A. At that time, the gyroscopes failed four months
before the actual mission.

The point here is that there is a contingency in Hubble’s life expectancy to accom-
modate  launch  delays—for  what  ever  reason.  However,  by  picking  a  deliberately
tight  development  schedule,  we  are  not  ‘‘burning  up  runway  before  take-off.’’  By
holding to a quick start and tight schedule pressures, the capability to use the con-
tingency  later,  if  and  when  it  is  really  needed,  has  been  preserved.  Furthermore,
it  saves  cost  since  it  take  advantage  of  the  people  knowledge  and  skills  already  on
the Program and it holds the program run-out time to a minimum.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Colin A. Norman, Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins

University

Question submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. If funding for a Hubble Origins Probe were to come at the expense of the timely
launch  of  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  or  other  priorities  identified  in  the
most recent Decadal Survey, would you still believe it should be funded?

A1. If the crucial decision whether to extend Hubble Science or not eventually came
to depend on the availability of funding for the Hubble Origins Probe (and presum-
ably  this  would  only  occur  if  manned  and  robotic  servicing  proved  unfeasible)  then
the  case  should  be  peer-reviewed  thoroughly  and  promptly  by  the  Academy  with
very careful consideration given to the existing Decadal Survey and its existing pri-
orities.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Dr.  Norman,  it  appears  that  the  enhanced  scientific  capability  of  your  Hubble
Origins  Probe  is  critically  dependent  on  the  inclusion  of  the  Very  Wide  Field
Imager (VWFI).

Q1a. Does  this  instrument  currently  exist  as  space-qualified  hardware  or  would  it

have to be developed?

A1a. This  instrument  does  not  exist  as  space-qualified  hardware,  and  it  has  to  be
developed but it is worth emphasizing that the VWFI design consists of space-quali-
fied devices and highly reliable components.
Q1b. Your  proposal  indicates  that  the  Japanese  would  provide  the  VWFI.  Has  the

Japanese government agreed to fund the development of the instrument?

A1b. The  Japanese  government  has  not  yet  agreed  to  fund  the  development  of  the
instrument.  But,  our  Japanese  colleagues  have  submitted  the  mission  proposal  to
the  Japanese  space  agency  JAXA.  Our  understanding  is  the  JAXA  will  make  their
best effort to support the U.S.-led HOP mission.
Q1c. Have  the  Japanese  ever  developed  and  flown  a  comparable  imager  in  space  or

would this be a new development?

A1c. There  have  been  excellent  collaborations  between  NASA  and  the  Japanese
space  agency  especially  in  X-ray  astronomy  and  in  solar  physics.  A  comparable
imager  is  the  50cm  diffraction-limited  visible  light  telescope  developed  by  the  Na-
tional Astronomical Observatory of Japan aboard the JAXA–NASA Solar-B mission.
NASA provided the focal plane package for the telescope.
Q1d. New  instrument  developments  are  typically  complex  undertakings.  What
amount of slack do you have in your mission schedule to accommodate any pos-
sible delays with the instrument?

A1d. Six months of reserve are allocated in the four-year long development schedule
for VWFI. This is the primary slack allocated to accommodate possible delays in the
instrument. However, there is another two weeks of reserve in the spacecraft-to-in-
strument  two-month  long  integration  schedule.  This  allows  for  the  possibility  of
VWFI  acceptance  at  a  slightly  later  than  nominal  date.  There  is  additionally  four
months  of  schedule  reserve  allocated  in  the  13-month  system-level  integration  and
test span. This enables late insertion of the VWFI during ambient functional testing
or prior to space vehicle Thermal Vacuum/Thermal Balance testing.
Q1e. Would  you  fly  Hubble  Origins  Probe  without  the  VWFI  if  the  instrument  were

delayed in its development?

A1e. We would make every effort to fly HOP with the VWFI unless there were very
significant  delays,  because  of  the  very  strong  science  enhancement  the  VWFI  pro-
vides. We do not anticipate any significant delays.

STATEMENT OF THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS—

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (IEEE–USA)

Concerning the Hubble Space Telescope

IEEE–USA appreciates this opportunity to share our views on the need for contin-
ued  support  of  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  for  this  hearing  of  the  House  Science
Committee. As an organization of engineers and technical professionals, we support
exploring  all  possible  avenues  to  prolong  the  useful  life  of  the  Hubble  telescope  for
the benefit of science and humanity.

IEEE–USA believes that NASA’s benefit and risk analyses should consider the fu-
ture  scientific  value  of  maintaining  the  Hubble  and  that  the  public  should  be  in-
formed about the considerations and tradeoffs considered in making a final decision
on a service mission to the HST. To this end, IEEE–USA recommends that:

sion.

• NASA  should  continue  planning  and  preparing  for  the  SM–4  servicing  mis-
• In  consultation  with  other  government  agencies,  external  experts,  and  the
National  Research  Council,  NASA  should  strive  to  develop  procedures,  tech-
nology and equipment that would allow the safe servicing of the HST.

The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  is  a  2.4-meter  reflecting  telescope,  which  was
deployed  in  low-Earth  orbit  (600  kilometers)  by  the  crew  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Dis-
covery on 25 April 1990. HST is a cooperative program of the European Space Agen-
cy  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  to  operate  a
long-lived  space-based  observatory  for  the  benefit  of  the  international  astronomical
community. HST’s location above the Earth’s atmosphere allows its scientific instru-
ments (cameras, spectrographs and other sensors) to acquire high-resolution images
of astronomical objects.

The  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  is  a  2.4-meter  reflecting  telescope,  which  was
deployed  in  low-Earth  orbit  (600  kilometers)  by  the  crew  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Dis-
covery on 25 April 1990. HST is a cooperative program of the European Space Agen-

community. HST’s location above the Earth’s atmosphere allows its scientific instru-
ments (cameras, spectrographs and other sensors) to acquire high-resolution images
of astronomical objects.

Since  its  launch,  the  Hubble  telescope  has  provided  astronomers  and  humanity
with measurements that provided, among other results, fundamental new results in
planetary science; discovery of the most distant object in the solar system; more ac-
curate  estimates  of  the  age  of  the  universe;  better  measurements  of  the  universe’s
rate  of  expansion;  the  deepest  portrait  of  the  visible  universe  ever  achieved  by  hu-
mankind;  the  discovery  of  new  stars  and  dynamic  phenomena  in  space;  and  new
views of comets and black holes.

The  planned  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  will  eventually  provide  a  new  capa-
bility for scientific research, but will not launch until 2011, at the earliest. Prospects
for  continued  operation  of  Hubble  until  that  date  without  a  servicing  mission  are
small.  The  absence  of  the  Hubble’s  extraordinary  abilities  would  adversely  impact
astronomical research. Maintaining the Hubble will accommodate any delays in the
Webb  Space  Telescope.  And  having  both  telescopes  on  the  station  until  the  Hubble
concludes its mission will increase space research capacity.

IEEE–USA  is  an  organizational  unit  of  the  IEEE.  It  was  created  in  1973  to  ad-
vance  the  public  good  and  promote  the  careers  and  public-policy  interests  of  the
more than 225,000 technology professionals who are U.S. members of the IEEE. The
IEEE  is  the  world’s  largest  technical  professional  society.  For  more  information,  go
