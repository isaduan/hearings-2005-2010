THE  WRIGHT  AMENDMENT 

THURSDAY,  NOVEMBER  10,  2005 

U.S. SENATE, 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  9:25  a.m.  in  room 
SH–216,  Hart  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Conrad  Burns, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator BURNS. Good morning. We’ll call the Committee to order. 
It  is  the  witching  hour,  maybe  a  couple  of  minutes  early,  and  I 
have  some  colleagues  on  the  way,  but  we’ve  got  a  lot  of  ground  to 
cover,  and  we’ve  got  votes  at  11:30,  and  we’re  trying  to  round  up 
and get everybody out of this town by the middle of next week. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BURNS.  Well,  it’s  OK  to  dream  a  little  here,  and  it’s  OK 
to be optimistic. I have a statement that will be submitted by Sen-
ator  Rockefeller  this  morning,  as  he  has  a  conflict.  And  we’ll  put 
that in the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Mr. Chairman. 
When  the  cities  of  Dallas  and  Ft.  Worth  agreed  to  build  Dallas/Ft.  Worth  Inter-
national Airport in the late 1960s, it was agreed that each city would decommission 
its  own  passenger-service  airports.  However,  Dallas’s  Love  Field  was  a  busier  air-
port  than  Fort  Worth’s  and  in  a  more  desirable  location,  and  so  several  entre-
preneurs  saw  opportunities  for  keeping  it  open,  most  notably  Southwest  Airlines. 
Prior  to  the  opening  of  DFW  International  Airport,  Southwest  Airlines  appealed  to 
the  courts  to  keep  Love  Field  open  so  that  it  could  continue  to  operate  from  there. 
In  1973,  the  courts  granted  Southwest  Airlines  the  right  to  continue  to  operate 
intrastate  service  within  Texas  out  of  Love  Field,  thus  preventing  the  airport  from 
being closed. 

After  deregulation  of  the  U.S.  airline  industry  in  1978,  Southwest  Airlines  was 
able  to  enter  the  larger  passenger  markets  and  announced  plans  to  start  providing 
service  outside  of  Texas  in  1979.  In  1979,  Congress  passed  legislation  which  origi-
nally  limited  traffic  from  Dallas’s  Love  Field  airport  to  points  within  Texas,  Lou-
isiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. In 1997, the law was changed to ex-
pand  the  limits  to  include  the  States  of  Kansas,  Mississippi,  and  Alabama.  I  would 
note that this Committee did not approve of the changes to the law, but rather the 
Appropriations Committee as part of annual spending bills made these changes. 

The  deregulation  of  the  airline  industry  has  brought  fundamental  changes  to  our 
country.  In  many  ways  deregulation  has  been  an  unqualified  success.  Average  air 
fares  are  lower  today  than  they  were  20  years  ago.  Southwest  Airlines  is  certainly

the industry’s shining example of what deregulation hoped to achieve—greater com-
petition  and  offerings  for  consumers.  However,  as  Southwest  expanded  from  its 
Texas  base,  it  understood  that  certain  limitations  were  set  in  place  to  foster  the 
growth  of  air  service  from  Dallas/Ft.  Worth  International  Airport.  The  restrictions 
on  operations  out  of  Love  Field  are  similar  to  the  conditions  on  serving  Washing-
ton’s National Airport and New York’s LaGuardia Airport. Every carrier who serves 
these  airports  understands  the  federally  mandated  restrictions  that  are  associated 
with each facility. 

Over  the  years,  I  have  heard  complaints  that  each  of  the  rules  governing  oper-
ations at these three airports is unfair and stifles competition. However, I have op-
posed and Congress has consistently rejected efforts to undermine these restrictions 
because  they  fulfill  other  important  national  aviation  policy  goals—making  sure 
America’s small communities have access to these three airports. 

Although deregulation benefited a great number of people in large urban and sub-
urban  regions  of  our  country,  it  has  resulted  in  the  loss  of  air  service  to  countless 
small  and  rural  communities.  For  example,  five  of  seven  commercial  airports  in 
West  Virginia  rely  on  federally  subsidized  air  service  as  airline  after  airline  has 
ceased service to them. 

The  only  way  that  many  of  these  communities  have  retained  access  to  the  na-
tional  aviation  system  after  deregulation  is  because  deregulation  also  fostered  the 
creation  of  a  new  business  model—hub-and-spoke  networks.  Network  carriers  pro-
vide service to hundreds of small cities in order to feed passengers into hub airports. 
American  Airlines  created  and  then  perfected  this  business  model  that  all  major 
carriers  subsequently  adopted.  This  allows  a  passenger  in  West  Virginia  to  fly  to 
Dulles, Detroit, Atlanta, or Houston and then onto the rest of the world. 

Southwest  Airlines  followed  a  different  path  and  arguably  a  more  financially 
sound  one  over  the  years.  They  chose  to  serve  larger  communities  but  from  sec-
ondary airports. Although this service strategy is just one part of a number of inno-
vative and forward thinking business decisions, no one can doubt that the selective 
service  patterns  of  the  company  play  a  large  part  in  its  success.  Over  the  last  dec-
ade,  the  industry  has  seen  a  number  of  companies  emulate  the  business  model  of 
Southwest  with  varying  degrees  of  success.  No  question  exists  that  Southwest  has 
forced the entire industry to become more efficient. 

Unfortunately,  this  business  model  means  that  Southwest  or  its  low-cost 
emulators  will  likely  never  serve  communities  like  Charleston,  West  Virginia  or 
Bozeman,  Montana.  I  want  to  commend  Southwest  and  its  employees  for  the  tre-
mendous success they have achieved. I do not mean in any way to criticize the com-
pany.  I  do  not  blame  them  for  making  financial  decisions  in  the  best  interests  of 
their  company,  but  I  must  support  policies  that  make  sure  my  state’s  communities 
continue to have air service and access to critical airports. Many airlines have made 
significant  business  decisions  and  sizable  investments  based  upon  the  parameters 
that  exist  as  a  result  of  these  rules.  Any  change  could  upset  the  financial  health 
of the industry and impact the service of the national airspace system. 

It is for this reason that I cannot support lifting the current restrictions on oper-
ations out of Dallas Love Field. I believe that lifting the amendment would decrease 
service  to  small  communities  that  currently  have  access  to  Dallas/Ft.  Worth  Inter-
national Airport. I also oppose the piecemeal dismantling of the restrictions on Love 
Field  through  the  appropriations  process.  I  will  also  strenuously  oppose  any  at-
tempts  to  lift  the  perimeter  rules  at  Washington  National  Airport  and  New  York 
LaGuardia Airport. 

In  addition,  I  believe  that  before  this  Committee  considers  any  changes  to  the 
Wright  Amendment  we  should  hear  from  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  and 
Transportation  Security  Administration  as  to  how  they  would  react  to  a  major  ex-
pansion of Love Fields’ infrastructure and passenger load. I am not clear that either 
agency  has  the  resources  to  make  sure  that  safety  and  security  can  be  maintained, 
especially in light of the significant funding cuts the majority imposed on TSA. 

I  would  also  note  that  as  far  as  I  can  observe.  the  crisis  in  commercial  aviation 
continues  unabated.  None  of  the  legacy  airlines  are  making  any  money.  The  pres-
sures of low fares and high fuel costs continue to prevent a real recovery. Even the 
financial  futures  of  low-cost  carriers  such  as  Southwest  are  questionable  in  light  of 
high fuel prices. 

Over  the  last  several  months,  I  have  met  with  a  number  of  airline  CEOs,  union 
leaders, and others regarding the steps Congress needs to take to help stabilize the 
commercial  airline  industry  and  return  it  to  profitability,  I  had  a  number  of  frank 
and honest discussions. Unfortunately. there is no easy answer, but there are things 
Congress  can  and  must  do.  If  we  fail  to  act,  small  communities  across  West  Vir-
ginia, and the country, will be left without air service.

To  address  a  number  of  immediate  financial  issues  with  the  industry,  I  have  in-
troduced  legislation  to  help  airlines  deal  with  their  pension  obligations  and  to  ex-
tend  the  FAA’s  war  risk  insurance  program,  and  I  have  opposed  the  Administra-
tion’s proposed increase in the aviation security fee. Unfortunately, the pension bill 
is stalled and this Committee has not acted on the war-risk insurance provision. 

Although  these  actions  are  important  to  returning  the  industry  to  financial 
health,  they  are  not  enough.  Although  this  Committee  has  held  a  number  of  hear-
ings  on  aviation  issues,  we  have  not  begun  to  explore  what  policies  we  should  be 
adopting  to  make  sure  that  the  commercial  aviation  industry  remains  financially 
viable.  I  am  not  sure  that  a  discussion  over  the  Wright  Amendment  is  an  area 
where Congress needs to spend a great deal of time. 

I  believe  we  need  to  start  developing  new  thinking  about  how  to  approach  the 
problems in the airline industry if it is going to survive and that may mean rethink-
ing the government’s role in aviation—I am not suggesting full on re-regulation but 
something  has  to  change  and  I  hope  the  Committee  spends  a  great  deal  of  time  on 
the real issues affecting the industry and the aviation system as a whole. 

Senator  BURNS.  First  of  all,  I  want  to  thank  the  panels  for  com-
ing  this  morning.  We  appreciate  those  who  have  come  up  to  join 
us.  Also,  we  feel  like  we’re  caught  in  a  Texas  ambush  here  a  little 
bit. Nonetheless, we’re going to take a look at this situation as best 
we can. 

I  want  everybody  to  remember  that  this  is  a  Senate  proceeding. 
The  topic,  I  know,  sparks  a  lot  of  emotions  and  we  want  to  get  as 
much  information  out  of  this  hearing  as  we  possibly  can.  And,  of 
course,  we  do  have  the  votes  coming  up,  and  we’ve  got  a  lot  of 
ground to cover. 

Congress enacted the Wright Amendment as a part of the Inter-
national Air Transportation Act of 1979. It was designed to protect 
the  interest  of  both  Dallas/Fort  Worth,  the  DFW  Airport,  and 
Southwest Airlines. The amendment contains a general prohibition 
on interstate commercial aviation to and from Love Field in Dallas, 
Texas, with a few exceptions. 

Over  the  years,  the  Wright  Amendment  has  been  considered  a 
compromise  between  all  interested  parties.  Today,  following  the 
terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the Delta dehubbing at DFW, we find 
ourselves  revisiting  the  circumstances  and  original  intent  of  the 
Wright  Amendment.  Over  the  last  year,  we  have  seen  a  flurry  of 
studies and posturing bringing us to this hearing today. 

While  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  from  the  panels,  I  would 
like  the  record  to  show  that  I  believe  this  issue  should  be  looked 
at  in  a  larger  context.  The  current  FAA  reauthorization  bill  is  set 
to expire September of 2007. This issue should be considered in an 
overall  comprehensive  forum.  This  issue,  while  much  of  the  con-
troversy surrounding the possible repeal of the Wright Amendment 
is local and regional, it will certainly affect our entire aviation sys-
tem. 

I  welcome  our  colleagues  here  today:  Senator  Bond  and  Inhofe, 
along with Representatives Johnson, Granger, and Hensarling—I’ll 
get  it  one  of  these  days;  I’ve  only  known  you  for  a  hundred  years. 
And we’re glad that you could join us today. 

And,  finally,  I’d  like  to  also  acknowledge  the  leadership  of  Sen-
ator  Hutchison  on  this  issue.  We  have  worked  very  close  to  trying 
to solve this problem. And this seems to be hanging over all of us, 
and  she  has  worked  very,  very  hard  in  finding  some  common 
ground  here  and  to  solve  it  with  fairness  to  everybody.  And  I’m 
glad she was able to join us today.

So,  I  would  ask  her  if  she  has  a  statement  and  I  thank  her  for 

coming today. 

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I want to thank Senator Burns for agreeing to hold this hearing. 
This is a very complicated issue. It’s one that’s very difficult to ex-
plain  to  Congress,  because  it  has  so  many  local  concerns  and,  cer-
tainly, consequences. 

I  do  think  that  having  this  hearing  with  all  sides  represented  is 
a  positive  step,  and  I  do  hope  that  we  can  put  into  context  the 
many myriad of issues that are at stake here. 

When  Dallas/Fort  Worth  was  told  by  the  Federal  Government, 
more than 30 years ago that they would have to have one regional 
airport,  this  was  done  so  that  the  Federal  Government  would  not 
have  to  support  two  major  airports,  and  it  was  done  because  Fort 
Worth was a growing city and area, and a regional airport that was 
halfway  in  between  was  considered  to  be  the  best  policy.  So,  in 
1968,  after  years  of  difficult  negotiations,  the  cities  did  agree  to 
build DFW Airport. 

All the airlines then serving Love Field, and Fort Worth’s Great-
er  Southwest  Airport,  agreed,  in  writing,  to  move  service  to  the 
new  DFW  Airport.  The  Fort  Worth  Airport  was  closed,  but  Love 
Field remained open. 

In 1973, Southwest Airlines then stated its desire to operate out 
of  Love  Field  and  won  the  ability  to  operate  an  intrastate  airline. 
The  Wright  Amendment  then  came  in  after  a  court  order  and  in 
a compromise—it was passed by Congress—that allowed service to 
the  four  contiguous  States  from  Dallas  Love  Field,  in  addition  to 
the  intrastate  service.  The  Wright  Amendment  actually  opened  up 
Love  Field,  as  opposed  to  the  view  around  here  that  it  is  actually 
a limitation. 

Then, just in the last 3 years, Senator Shelby added, through the 
appropriations  bill,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  and  Kansas.  This  Com-
mittee did not assert its jurisdiction. Now the Appropriations Com-
mittee is in the process of adding Missouri. 

I  think  it  is  very  important,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  this  Committee 
to assert its jurisdiction and to come up with the right answer, but 
I  want  to  say  that  I  believe  the  local  community  leaders  in  Dallas 
and Fort Worth should be the ones to come up with the right plan. 
I  think  it  puts  you  and  this  Committee  and  the  Appropriations 
Committee  and  everyone  involved  in  a  very  bad  situation  to  try  to 
dictate from here what is right for the citizens of North Texas, the 
people who live near Love Field, the people who use Love Field, the 
passengers who use Love Field, as well as those who use DFW and 
support DFW. We do need to understand how changing the Wright 
Amendment  would  affect  neighborhoods,  would  affect  the  economy 
of  North  Texas,  and  the  smaller  cities  in  Texas.  We  did  not  have 
the ability in this hearing to bring mayors of cities like Abilene and 
Amarillo  into  this  hearing.  That  is  a  very  important  component  of 
this  whole  issue,  because  many  of  them  also  are  affected  by  a 
change in the Wright Amendment.

So,  I  do  think  it’s  an  issue  that  should  be  decided  in  Texas.  I 
think  that  will  require  leadership  on  the  part  of  community  lead-
ers,  as  well  as  the  two  major  businesses  involved.  Southwest  Air-
lines and American Airlines are two of the biggest employers in our 
region.  It  puts  all  of  us  in  a  horribly  difficult  position  to  try  to  do 
what’s  right  for  all  the  people  who  work  at  these  two  airlines  and 
what’s right for all the citizens who live in this huge Metroplex. 

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  a  major  first  step.  I  appreciate  your 
doing  it.  I  know  that  you,  too,  are  in  a  difficult  position.  I  hope 
that—I  hope  that  all  the  people  who  are  festering  for  a  change  in 
the  Wright  Amendment  will  listen  to  what  is  said  in  this  hearing, 
regardless  of  the  side  you’re  on.  But  I  hope  that  those  of  you  who 
are testifying today will not just leave, walk out, and not know all 
the  things  that  have  been  said.  And  particularly,  Senator  Bond, 
who  is  the  Chairman  of  the  Appropriations  Committee,  I  hope  you 
will  hear  the  testimony  from  all  the  witnesses  today  as  you  move 
forward with your very key position here. 

So,  having  said  that,  I  will  stop  and  start  listening  to  the  wit-
nesses  myself.  And  I  thank  you,  again,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  begin-
ning to open up the issue that won’t go away. 

Thank you. 
Senator BURNS. I don’t know whether to thank you or not. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS. But I thank you for your hard work. 
And  let  me  also  say  that  I  go  back  in  airlines  a  little  ways.  I 
have a working knowledge of them, because I can remember, when 
we started writing tickets. We didn’t have computers to write tick-
ets then, you had to write them out. On a ticket counter in Kansas 
City,  saying,  ‘‘Well,  now,  do  you  want  to  go  to  Dallas,  or  do  you 
want  to  go  to  Amon  Carter  Field  in  Fort  Worth?’’  So,  we  go  way 
back  in  this  airline  industry.  I  guess  I’d  still  be  in  Kansas  City  if 
I’d  got  what  I  was  shooting  for,  but  I  ended  up  back  in  Montana. 
And I think, today, we want to come up with the right plan from 
the  Wright  Amendment.  We’re  going  to  have  to  start—when  you 
say  ‘‘right,’’  you’re  going  to  have  to  spell  it  out.  Does  it  start  with 
a ‘‘W’’ or an ‘‘R’’ this morning? So, it’ll be interesting. 

Senator  Inhofe,  I  welcome  you  to  the  Committee  this  morning, 
and we look forward to your comments. I will tell you that I would 
keep  our  statements  as  short  as  we  possibly  can.  We’ve  got  a  lot 
of territory to cover this morning. Your complete statement will be 
made  part  of  the  record.  And  we  welcome  all  of  the  Congressional 
representation that’s at the table this morning. 

Senator Inhofe? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OKLAHOMA 

Senator INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your al-
lowing  me  to  go  first.  I  chair  the  Environment  and  Public  Works 
Committee,  and  I’m  chairing  a  committee  right  now,  in  the  next 
building, supposedly. So—— 

Senator BURNS. Would you get that under control up there? 
Senator INHOFE. Yes, we’ll do that. You control yours, I’ll control 

mine. 

[Laughter.]

Senator  INHOFE.  We  have  Barbara  McNally,  who’s  here  today, 
Mr. Chairman. She’s the Airport Director of Lawton Municipal Air-
port. And I appreciate her being here, because she has a pretty big 
dog  in  this  fight,  too.  And,  contrary  to  what  a  lot  of  people  think, 
this  is  not  an  argument,  a  debate,  over  the  legacy  carrier,  Amer-
ican  Airlines,  and  the  discount  carrier,  Southwest.  It  has  a  lot  to 
do with the investment in infrastructure. 

You  know,  I  chair  the  Environment  and  Public  Works  Com-
mittee.  We  had  the  highway  bill  that  came  out,  and  one  of  the 
major  considerations  is  locating  our  transportation  systems,  our 
highways,  and  not  changing  the  rules  as  time  goes  by.  The  same 
thing  is  true  with  aviation  infrastructure.  It’s  no  different  at  all. 
Not  only  is  it  cost  prohibitive  for  a  community  to  allow  an  indi-
vidual  business  to  decide,  after  the  fact,  they  want  to  reconfigure 
the transportation asset, but it affects the economies of the commu-
nities outside, as well as the immediate area. 

The communities of Dallas and Fort Worth, as a result of the air-
lines  serving  Love  Field,  agreed  to  en  route  all  Dallas  traffic  to 
DFW.  I  think  Senator  Hutchison  covered  that  very  well,  and  I 
won’t  be  redundant  about  the  history  of  how  we  got  where  we  are 
today.  But,  at  the  time,  I  would  like  to,  and  try  to  stay  within  a 
timeframe  here,  talk  about—the  controversy  surrounding  Love 
Field  for  commercial  aviation  is  not  new.  Southwest  has  opposed 
restrictions  in  the  past,  and  it’s  something  that  will  take  place  in 
the future. I would comment, though, to my good friends at South-
west—and,  by  the  way,  I  have  to  say  this,  I  have  the  utmost  re-
spect  for  Herb  Kelleher.  If  I  were  in  his  position,  I’d  be  doing  ex-
actly the thing that he’s been doing. They’ve been able to carve out 
special  deals.  In  1971,  1972,  1973,  and  1979,  when  the  Wright 
Amendment  came  along,  they  said,  ‘‘Well,  let’s  make  a  deal  here.’’ 
When they started out, they were a intrastate airline. They just op-
erated in the State of Texas. Then when they started operating out 
of  the  State  of  Texas,  that’s  when  the  Wright  Amendment  came, 
and that’s why we, in our State of Oklahoma, as one of the original 
five  States  that  was  agreed  to,  they’d  have  to  stop  in  order  to  go 
beyond  that  boundary,  that  seemed  to  be  something  that  was  fair, 
and,  quite  frankly,  it  fit  Oklahoma’s  needs  very  well.  And  I  think 
American Airlines and other airlines adapted to that. 

Now,  I’ve  heard  the  arguments  in  terms  of,  ‘‘We  want  competi-
tion, we don’t want the anti-free-enterprise.’’ I think every Senator 
in  here  knows  that  no  one  has  a  better  record  on  free  enterprise 
than  I  do,  and  I  was  ranked  Number  One  in  the  Senate  for  that 
by HUMAN EVENTS just the other day. And I have never thought 
it  was  Government’s  responsibility  to  favor  one  business  over  an-
other.  It’s  totally  appropriate  for  a  Government  to  set  parameters 
around where and how infrastructure is used. 

Now, as Southwest has grown, so has the desire to get more na-
tionwide  nonstop  service.  And  I  can  understand  that.  Unfortu-
nately,  this  would  violate  both  the  word  and  the  spirit  of  the 
Wright Amendment in original communities’ agreement and, frank-
ly,  what  Southwest  agreed  to  at  that  time.  If  the  decision  is  made 
to  allow  nationwide  flights  into  and  out  of  Love  Field,  businesses, 
which  made  decisions  on  the  understanding  that  DFW  was  the

7 

commercial  aviation  hub  in  that  region,  will  have  the  rug  pulled 
out from under them. 

The key to continued private-sector investment in transportation 
infrastructure is certainty, to know that if you have a rule, that it’s 
going to be there, and that no one’s going to be violating that rule. 
And if Government changes the playing field, the private-sector in-
vestment  in  public  projects  will  appear  most  risky  and  less  invit-
ing.  And  not  only  is  a  change  in  the  rules  unfair,  it  sets  a  terrible 
precedent that will hinder future private investment. 

I’ve  never  objected  to  Southwest’s  current  seven-states  service, 
even though that grew from five to—from four to five to seven. But 
the  legislation  introduced  by  my  good  friend,  one  of  my  best 
friends, Senator Ensign, from Nevada, proposes opening Love Field 
to  nationwide  long-haul  flights.  And  I  think  that  the  consumers  in 
rural  communities  have  a  lot  to  do  with  this.  Certainly,  my  State 
of Oklahoma would be adversely affected. 

And  let  me  just,  kind  of,  tell  you,  I  do  have  a  parochial  dog  in 

this fight, and it’s a pretty big one. In fact, I have two. 

First of all, we have American Airlines, which is our eighth-larg-
est  employer  in  the  State.  We  want  to  do  what  we  can  to  be  fair 
with them. We don’t want to legislate them out of business. 

Second,  we  have  the  American  Airlines  that  gives  service—we 
have, currently in Oklahoma, 12 daily flights from my city of Tulsa, 
in  and  out  of  Dallas;  nine  from  Oklahoma  City,  in  and  out  of  Dal-
las;  six  from  Lawton,  in  and  out  of  Dallas.  And  I  don’t  think  any-
one  questions  that  if  something  were  to  happen  and  the  Ensign 
amendment—or legislation were to become a reality, that we would 
lose a lot of that. And people will say, ‘‘Well, wait a minute, South-
west  would  come  in  and  pick  up  the  slack.’’  That’s  not  true.  We 
have  excellent  service  with  Southwest,  but  let’s  keep  in  mind,  we 
have  it  because  in  order  to  go  to  Phoenix,  Chicago,  St.  Louis  or 
Kansas  City,  they  have  to  stop  in  Oklahoma.  And  so,  it’s  a  no- 
brainer, we would lose service, and I think we all know that. 

I  think  it’s  important,  if  long-haul  nationwide  flights  from  Love 
Field  were  to  become  legal,  American  would  be  forced  to  compete 
with  Southwest  by  offering  flights  to  similar  destinations  out  of 
Love  Field.  Why  is  this?  If  you  look  at  the  traffic  that  travels  to 
Oklahoma, two-thirds of that traffic lives closer to Love Field than 
it does DFW. And so, American would be forced to go in there and 
have two operations after this change were made. So, that’s a very 
difficult thing for us to deal with. 

And  I  would  say,  also,  that  I  know  that  there  are  some  people 
from  Texas  that  are  very  frustrated  by  this,  but  I  would  like  to 
comment  on  something  that  I  just  found  this  morning.  It  was  a 
May of 2005 study that says—and I’ll quote from it—it said, ‘‘Inde-
pendent analysis has shown that, in addition to the 220 flights lost 
by  Delta  Air  Lines’  recent  departure  from  DFW,  repealing  Wright 
would  cost  DFW  Airport  some  204  flights  a  day,  21  million  pas-
sengers annually, and slash airport passenger traffic back to levels 
seen  20  years  ago.  DFW  would  not  recover  for  nearly  2  decades.’’ 
So,  finally,  I  believe,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  DFW  has  undergone  a 
multibillion  dollar  facelift  over  the  past  several  years.  If  the  deci-
sion  is  made  to  allow  increased  operations  at  Love  Field,  one  has 
to wonder about the billions of dollars already invested in DFW.

Really, that’s their problem more than it is our problem, in Okla-
homa. Our problem, in Oklahoma, is service that we could lose, and 
that’s something that we don’t want to lose. 

Let’s look, just for a minute, at some of the other places. Denver 
International  Airport  went  through  the  same  thing.  There  are— 
people  are  saying,  ‘‘All  right,  I’d  like  to  have  a  special  deal’’—I’m 
not saying it was Southwest, but some said, ‘‘I’d like to have a spe-
cial deal carved out to me so we could use Stapleton and everybody 
else go to Denver.’’ Well, they wanted to make sure that didn’t hap-
pen,  and  they  plowed  up  their  runways,  Stapleton.  Same  thing 
happened  up  in  Seattle,  on  Sea-Tac.  People  wanted  to  have  a  spe-
cial  deal  to  use  Boeing—the  Boeing  Field  up  there.  They  were  de-
nied  that,  because  of  the  concept  of  having  to  have  a  regional  air-
port. 

So, this is not the only place that this is happening, and I would 
just  say  that  there  have  been  a  lot  of  special  deals  that  have  been 
carved  out  for  Southwest  Airlines,  and  I  know  that  they’ve  done  a 
good  job  of  negotiating.  They’ve  been  winners.  But  we’re  now  to  a 
point  where  we’re  going  to  have  to  say,  you  know,  expanding  this 
from  intrastate  and  then  to  five  States  and  then  to  seven  States, 
now  others  are  wanting  to  get  in—I  understand  the  Senator  from 
Missouri  would  like  to  be  included  in  that,  also—I  think  it’s  time 
that we make a decision. And, you’re right, Senator Hutchison, we 
need  to  bring  this  thing  to  closure  in  some  way.  And  I’m  thinking 
that if Senator Ensign’s bill would pass, what would open it up all 
over,  and  we  know  the  consequences.  I  know  that  they  would  be 
in  Oklahoma.  If  my  bill  passes,  then  that  would  force  Southwest 
to  go  and  compete  with  everybody  else  at  DFW.  And  maybe,  just 
maybe,  the  status  quo  is  a  better  deal.  It’s  working  out  fairly  well 
right  now.  We  might—I’d  want  the  Committee  to  consider  maybe 
that would be a good alternative. 

Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify in this very signifi-

cant matter that affects my State of Oklahoma, Mr. Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inhofe follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR FROM OKLAHOMA 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for an opportunity to share with you my views on pro-

posed changes to operations at Love Field in Dallas, Texas. 

Before  I  share  my  thoughts  regarding  the  Wright  Amendment,  I  would  like  to 
point  out  to  the  Members  of  the  Committee  that  Barbara  McNally,  the  Airport  Di-
rector for the Lawton Municipal Airport in Lawton, Oklahoma, is here this morning. 
The  community  of  Lawton  has  a  very  vested  interest  in  the  outcome  of  our  discus-
sions  today  because  Lawton  will  likely  lose  commercial  air  service  if  Love  Field  is 
opened up to long haul traffic. 

Contrary to what many believe, the controversy surrounding proposed operational 
changes  at  Dallas’  Love  Field  is  not  about  a  legacy  carrier,  American  Airlines, 
versus  a  discount  carrier,  Southwest.  It  is  rather  about  the  ability  of  a  community 
to determine where and how they invest their limited infrastructure dollars. 

As the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have a first 
hand knowledge of how difficult it is to fund and maintain infrastructure. The loca-
tion  of  a  major  highway  affects  economic  decisions  in  the  private  and  public  sector. 
Businesses  make  decisions  on  where  to  build  and  maintain  facilities  based  on  the 
location  of  a  highway,  likewise,  transportation  planning  choices  determine  commu-
nity  development.  Furthermore,  once  the  road  is  built,  businesses  who  chose  to  lo-
cate outside the immediate vicinity of a major transportation asset know they likely 
are increasing the operational costs of their business. 

The  location  of  a  community’s  aviation  infrastructure  is  no  different.  Not  only  is 
it  cost  prohibitive  for  a  community  to  allow  an  individual  business  to  decide  after

9 

the fact they want to reconfigure a transportation asset, but it effects the economies 
of  communities  outside  of  the  immediate  area  as  well.  The  communities  of  Dallas 
and  Fort-Worth  decided  to  build  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Airport  (DFW).  As  a  result,  the 
airlines  serving  Love  Field  agreed  to  re-route  all  Dallas  commercial  air  traffic  to 
DFW.  This  is  certainly  not  unusual.  In  fact,  when  the  new  Denver  International 
Airport (DEN) was built, there was an agreement reached that all flights, both com-
mercial and private into and out of Stapleton Airport would cease and other smaller 
airports in the surrounding area were limited in their operations. To further protect 
the  investment  of  the  new  airport,  the  runways  at  Stapleton  were  destroyed  so  the 
decision to close Stapleton could not be revisited. The reason, much as the thinking 
in  Dallas,  was  the  community  had  made  a  choice  to  invest  limited  infrastructure 
dollars  for  a  major  asset  at  DEN  and  all  commercial  aviation  operations  in  this  re-
gion needed to use DEN. 

Controversy surrounding the use of Love Field for commercial aviation is not new. 
Southwest  has  long  opposed  restrictions  at  Love  Field  and  special  allowances  have 
been  made  for  them.  In  December  of  1968  the  DFW  Airport  Use  Agreement  was 
reached  in  which  air  carriers  agreed  to  move  to  the  new  regional  airport.  Because 
Southwest  began  its  intrastate  service  from  Love  Field  in  1971,  it  was  not  part  of 
that  agreement  and  did  not  feel  bound  by  it.  In  1972,  the  Regional  Airport  Board 
and the communities of Dallas and Fort Worth sued Southwest to force them to use 
DFW. In 1973, the Court granted Southwest the right to remain and offer intrastate 
air service at Love Field. 

All interstate flights into and out of the Dallas/Fort Worth region were being han-
dled  by  DFW  until  1979  when  Jim  Wright,  then  the  Majority  Leader  of  the  U.S. 
House,  carved  out  a  special  exception  allowing  interstate  flights  from  Love  Field  to 
a  list  of  what  is  now  seven  states,  including  Oklahoma.  This  exception,  is  known 
as the Wright Amendment. 

It  has  been  proposed  that  the  protections  for  DFW  memorialized  in  the  Wright 
Amendment  are  no  longer  necessary.  DFW  is  well  established  and  therefore  no 
longer  needs  the  protection.  Furthermore,  allowing  nationwide  flights  into  and  out 
of  Love  Field  is  good  for  consumers  because  it  will  provide  greater  competition.  Fi-
nally,  it  is  argued  that  the  Wright  Amendment  is  anti-free  enterprise  because  it  is 
artificially  holding  down  one  segment  of  an  industry,  namely  Southwest.  I  respect-
fully disagree. 

I  believe  my  credentials  as  a  free  enterprise,  pro-consumer  advocate  are  well  es-
tablished,  so  I  won’t  enumerate  them,  except  to  say  that  I  do  not  now  nor  have  I 
ever in my 40 plus years of public service thought it was the government’s responsi-
bility to favor one business over another. I do believe however, that it is the respon-
sibility of government to build infrastructure for public use and as such it is totally 
appropriate  for  government  to  set  parameters  around  where  and  how  that  infra-
structure is used. 

As Southwest has grown so has their desire for nationwide nonstop service in and 
out of Love Field. Unfortunately, this would violate both the word and spirit of the 
Wright  Amendment  and  the  original  communities’  agreement,  and  frankly  what 
Southwest agreed to at the time. If the decision is made to allow nationwide flights 
into  and  out  of  Love  Field,  businesses  which  made  decisions  on  the  understanding 
that DFW was the commercial aviation hub in that region will have the rug pulled 
out from underneath them. The key to continued private sector investment in trans-
portation  infrastructure  is  certainty.  If  the  government  changes  the  playing  field, 
private sector investment in public projects will appear more risky and less inviting. 
Not only is a change in the rules unfair, it sets a terrible precedent that will hinder 
future private investment. 

I  have  never  objected  to  Southwest’s  current  seven  state  service  from  Love  Field. 
But,  legislation  introduced  by  Sen.  John  Ensign  (R–NV)  proposes  opening  Love 
Field to nationwide, long-haul flights, something that would ultimately not only cost 
my  State,  but  I  believe  consumers  from  rural  communities  who  depend  on  links  to 
major hubs. 

Allow  me  to  illustrate  this  point  by  explaining  how  increased  service  out  of  Love 
Field  will  effect  Oklahoma.  Specifically,  expansion  of  service  out  of  Love  Field  will 
likely  affect  jobs  and  air  service  between  DFW  and  Oklahoma  communities.  Some 
may  not  realize,  but  American  Airlines  is  Oklahoma’s  eighth  largest  employer. 
Moreover,  our  State’s  economy  depends  on  the  worldwide  access  afforded  to  us  by 
connections  through  DFW.  Currently,  Oklahomans  enjoy  12  daily  flights  between 
Tulsa  and  Dallas  on  American  Airlines,  as  well  as  nine  daily  flights  between  Okla-
homa  City  and  Dallas  and  six  daily  flights  between  Lawton  and  Dallas.  However, 
if  Southwest  is  allowed  to  fly  nationwide  from  Love  Field  we  can  expect  a  stifling 
decrease  in  American  Airlines’  daily  service  to  Oklahoma  communities.  Some  may 
believe,  ‘‘no  problem,  Southwest  will  pick  up  the  slack.’’  Unfortunately,  this  is  not

the  case.  If  Love  Field  is  opened  up,  Southwest  would  no  longer  have  to  stop  in 
Oklahoma and it may not be in Southwest’s best economic interest to increase their 
service to Oklahoma, or for that matter other rural communities that are served by 
regional  carriers  feeding  into  DFW.  The  Southwest  business  model  is  successful  as 
a  point  to  point  service  and  frankly  smaller  communities  lose  under  that  scenario. 
Certainly  there  is  nothing  sacred  about  the  hub  and  spoke  system  and  likewise, 
any  carrier  who  chooses  to  operate  outside  of  this  system  is  free  to  do  so.  But  for 
rural  communities,  the  hub  and  spoke  system  that  feeds  regional  carriers  into  a 
larger hub is the only reason they have commercial air service. Point to point serv-
ice makes no economic sense, thus carriers using point to point tend to avoid small-
er markets. 

The  explanation  is  simple.  If  long-haul  nationwide  flights  from  Love  Field  were 
to  become  legal,  American  would  choose  to  compete  with  Southwest  by  offering 
flights  to  similar  destinations  out  of  Love  Field.  It  is  worth  noting  that  approxi-
mately  60  percent  of  American  Airlines’  DFW  travelers  live  closer  to  Love  Field 
than  DFW,  thus  they  would  have  no  option  but  to  compete  with  Southwest.  As  a 
consequence of offering new flights from Love Field, American will be forced to free 
up resources within their system to equip their new service offerings at Love Field. 
In  a  matter  that  is  purely  economic,  those  American  Airlines’  resources  could  be 
pulled  from  less  profitable  flights  to  Mid-western  cities  like  Oklahoma  City,  Tulsa, 
and  Lawton,  thereby  decreasing  the  frequency  of  flights  or  eliminating  them  alto-
gether. 

While  I  cannot  predict  how  Southwest  might  change  their  service  in  response  to 
opening up Love Field to long haul flights, we must be honest with ourselves. Cur-
rently some Southwest flights from Love Field to Oklahoma City and Tulsa are due 
to  the  Wright  Amendment.  However,  if  Southwest  were  allowed  to  fly  direct  from 
Love  Field  to  Kansas  City,  St.  Louis,  Las  Vegas,  Phoenix,  or  anywhere  else  in  the 
U.S. without stopping in Oklahoma, do you think they would? If you look down the 
road  and  consider  these  airlines’  likely  reactions  to  opening  up  Love  Field  to  all 
flights you will see it is the small rural consumers currently linked to DFW for serv-
ice outside of the region that lose. 

Finally,  DFW  has  undergone  a  multi-billion  dollar  face  lift  in  the  past  several 
years.  If  the  decision  is  made  to  allow  increased  operations  out  of  Love  Field,  one 
has  to  wonder  about  the  billions  of  dollars  already  invested  at  DFW  and  what  the 
future investment of Love Field will be as it undoubtedly will expand to handle in-
creased  traffic.  Unlike  Chicago  or  New  York  where  capacity  is  limited  and  two  air-
ports make sense, capacity at DFW is not an issue. In fact, there are 24 empty gates 
at DFW that Southwest could occupy and thereby fly to any city they choose. What 
is  being  contemplated  is  undoing  decisions  made  in  the  past  and  shifting  major  in-
frastructure dollars from one facility to another because at this point in time it ap-
pears  to  be  expedient.  If  that  is  where  we  are  headed,  then  I  have  to  wonder  who 
is next. Certainly Seattle community leaders have recently confronted this issue and 
have  chosen  to  protect  their  investment  at  SEA/TAC  and  not  allow  close-in  Boeing 
Field to be opened up for Southwest Airlines’ benefit. 

In  closing,  I  would  acknowledge  that  Oklahoma  certainly  will  be  affected  regard-
less  of  how  the  Committee  decides  to  respond  to  requests  for  operational  changes 
at  Love  Field.  That  is  why  I  introduced  S.  1425,  ‘‘The  True  Competition  Act’’  as  a 
counterpoint  to  the  Ensign  legislation.  However,  I  hope  the  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee will look beyond the dueling Wright Amendment bills and consider how reso-
lution  of  this  issue  will  set  a  precedent  for  every  community  and  the  decision  they 
have made or will make regarding aviation infrastructure. 

Maybe the status quo is the best deal. Do not forget, Southwest has already been 
given special consideration. First in 1973 when the Court allowed them to continue 
their  intrastate  operation  out  of  Love  Field  and  then  in  1979  when  the  Wright 
Amendment  allowed  them  to  operate  interstate  flights  to  the  five  contiguous  states 
of  Texas,  Louisiana,  Arkansas,  Oklahoma  and  New  Mexico  which  was  expanded  in 
1997 to include Alabama, Kansas and Mississippi. 

Thank you.

tation  leadership  on  the  Commerce  Committee,  and  Senator  En-
sign. Do you have a statement?

STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator LOTT. I’m just looking forward to hearing the witnesses. 
Senator  BURNS.  I’m  going  to  go  back  and  forth,  Senator  Ensign. 
Senator  Nelson  has  joined  us  from  Nebraska.  And  thank  you  for 
coming this morning. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appreciate 
the opportunity to be here today. And I, too, am interested in hear-
ing the testimony. 

Senator BURNS. Senator Ensign, thank you for coming this morn-

ing. And you have the proposed legislation. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Senator ENSIGN. Thank you, Senator Burns. 
I’ll  just  make  a  couple  of  brief  comments  and  ask  that  my  full 

statement be made part of the record. 

We  all  know  the  history  of  the  Wright  Amendment  being  on  the 
books  for  26  years.  It’s  interesting  what  Senator  Inhofe  was  just 
talking about, about the flights in and out of Oklahoma, and being 
concerned about that. When American Airlines pulled a lot of their 
flights out of Reno, Nevada, a few years ago, they were doing it be-
cause of a business plan. And, while we objected to it, because most 
of  those  flights  were  full,  and  we  tried  to  make  the  argument,  we 
didn’t  legislate  what  they  should,  or  should  not  do.  And  Reno,  in 
that  period  of  time,  has  increased  flights  from  other  areas.  What 
American had done is bought Reno Air, and then discontinued a lot 
of  the  service  out  of  there.  People  locally,  understandably,  were 
very upset, but, in the long run, it’s worked out just fine. The mar-
ket is taking care of it. 

The  United  States,  we  all  know,  we  haven’t  built  new  airports. 
OK. Our big airports are getting busier and busier and busier. The 
next  new  airport  that  is  slated  to  be  built  is  actually  slated  to  be 
built in southern Nevada. We’re not going to close McCarran. We’re 
actually  going  to  open  a  second  airport  and  let  them  operate  to-
gether. One is more of a reliever airport, but it’ll continue to grow. 
Unfortunately, it’ll be 2017 before that airport is built. 

All of us—the flying public flies and has increased delays because 
of—the larger airports are getting larger and larger. And we sit on 
the runways. I was in Atlanta the other day, and there must have 
been 20 airplanes in front of us. And that’s becoming a bigger and 
bigger problem. And the bigger airports cause more of that. 

So, DFW is a world-class airport. I don’t think it needs—person-
ally,  don’t  think  it  needs  protection  from  anybody.  But,  I  want  to 
address that customer that’s coming from Texas that maybe wants 
to  go  to  my  State,  southern  Nevada.  It  is  absolutely  ridiculous, 
when they have to go—say, they want to go to Las Vegas. They go 
through  Albuquerque.  And  they  have  to  actually  buy  a  ticket—a 
roundtrip  ticket  to  Albuquerque.  They  have  to  get  off  the  plane  in 
Albuquerque,  go  back  out  of  security,  recheck  their  baggage,  and 
they  have  to  have  another  ticket  from  Albuquerque  to  Las  Vegas. 
And, by the way, if they do that, Southwest Airlines can’t even tell 
them that they can do that. They’re not allowed, under the Wright 
Amendment, to tell them that they can do that.

And this is really a question of the flying public and the conven-
ience of the flying public to make the decisions based on what they 
want.  And  I  am  a  free-market  person,  and  I  believe  in  infrastruc-
ture. I think that that’s important, that the Government builds in-
frastructure  for  the  public  to  be  able  to  fly.  But,  in  this  case,  the 
Wright Amendment was set up a long time ago, has had its effect. 
I  just  believe  that  the  Wright  Amendment  has  outlived  its  useful-
ness, and it’s time to reflect more of the reality of the marketplace 
today,  just  as  I  believe  that  the  perimeter  rules  at  a  few  of  our 
eastern  airports  need  to  be  done  away  with,  as  well.  I  think  that 
we  need  to  have  more  competition.  I  think  it’s  healthy  for  the  air-
lines. I think it’s healthy for the flying public. They get better deals 
at  better  prices  with  better  service.  And  that  really  is  the  purpose 
for  the  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  that  I  have  put  forward. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Ensign follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Rockefeller,  thank  you  very  much  for  holding  a  hearing 
today  on  the  Wright  Amendment,  an  issue  that  affects  airline  passengers  across 
America.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  participants  on  today’s  panels  for  coming 
before  this  Committee  and  sharing  your  unique  and  varied  perspectives  on  this 
issue. 

The question at the heart of the Wright Amendment debate is whether we should 
allow  the  free  market  to  dictate  the  course  of  competition  or  whether  we  should 
allow  an  outdated  law  to  impose  unnecessary  government  restrictions  on  the  flying 
public. 

Today, if my constituents in Las Vegas or Reno wanted to fly to Dallas on South-
west  Airlines,  they  would  have  to  purchase  two  different  tickets  because  of  the 
Wright  Amendment—one  from  Nevada  to  Albuquerque  and  one  from  Albuquerque 
to Dallas. Then, when they got to Albuquerque, they would have to get off the plane, 
pick up their bags, check-in again with the second ticket, go through security a sec-
ond time, and then board the same plane to continue on to Dallas. This makes little 
sense to me, but the Wright Amendment makes it the law of the land. 

The  Wright  Amendment  has  been  on  the  books  for  26  years.  During  those  years, 
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) has become the third busiest airport 
in  the  world.  It  has  six  times  as  many  gates  as  Dallas  Love  Field,  is  ten  times 
busier, and is fourteen times the size of Love Field. Defenders of the Wright Amend-
ment  try  to  put  forward  the  argument  that  DFW  would  unduly  suffer  because  of 
competition  from  Love  Field  and  should  be  protected.  DFW  is  a  world-class  airport 
and does not need protection from anyone, least of all from Dallas Love Field. While 
perhaps  it  made  sense  in  1979  to  try  and  protect  a  fledgling  DFW,  this  arcane  law 
has  now  created  an  anti-competitive  atmosphere  in  the  North  Texas  region.  It  is 
clear that the Wright Amendment is an idea whose time has gone. 

When  the  Wright  Amendment  was  enacted  into  law  in  1979,  it  effectively  gave 
an  air  travel  monopoly  over  the  North  Texas  region  to  the  then-new  DFW.  The 
Wright  Amendment  today  limits  interstate  flights  to  and  from  Love  Field  to  only 
seven  nearby  states,  thus  propping  up  DFW  as  the  only  long-haul  airport  for  the 
region. The Wright Amendment is so arbitrary that it allows flights from Love Field 
to Albuquerque, but not to Kansas City which is over 100 miles closer. 

In  addition  to  the  perimeter  restrictions,  Love  Field  is  uniquely  burdened  with 
‘‘through-ticketing’’  restrictions.  No  other  airport  in  the  country  is  subject  to  these 
marketing prohibitions that restrict commercial free speech. 

I  want  to  mention  that  I  understand  this  is  a  contentious  issue  with  many  pas-
sionate advocates on both sides. I have spoken with many of today’s panel members, 
as well as with Senator Hutchison, a Member of this Committee and the senior Sen-
ator  from  Texas.  The  Wright  Amendment  has  a  long  history  in  the  Dallas/Fort 
Worth Metroplex and it greatly affects that community, but the Wright Amendment 
affects  nearly  every  American,  including  my  constituents  in  Nevada.  Air  travelers 
across the country pay higher fares and have fewer available flight options because 
the  Wright  Amendment  artificially  restricts  market  competition.  This  is  not  just  a 
Texas issue; it is indeed a national one.

As  we  hear  testimony  today  from  both  sides  of  the  issue,  it  is  important  to  keep 
in  mind  that  this  is  not  a  debate  about  the  respective  merits  of  Southwest  Airlines 
and  American  Airlines.  This  is  about  whether  or  not  it  is  appropriate  for  the  Fed-
eral  Government  to  meddle  in  the  free  market.  It  is  the  policy  of  this  country  that 
the Federal Government should not create barriers to competition in the airline in-
dustry, which is exactly what the Wright Amendment does. 

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 established that policy and, since the enact-
ment  of  that  landmark  legislation,  Americans  have  enjoyed  much  lower  fares  and 
greatly increased service. Deregulation has made the airline industry the most com-
petitive industry in the Nation, and consumers have benefited tremendously. 

In  an  effort  to  bring  the  positive  forces  of  deregulation  to  North  Texas,  Senator 
McCain  and  I  introduced  the  American  Right  to  Fly  Act,  S.  1424.  Senator  Sununu 
is a fellow co-sponsor of this legislation that would remove the punitive restrictions 
placed  on  Love  Field  and  I  invite  my  colleagues  to  join  our  effort,  an  effort  that  is 
very popular among those most directly affected. A recent poll of Dallas/Forth Worth 
residents, conducted by Public Opinion Strategies, found that a repeal of the Wright 
Amendment  is  favored  by  a  82  percent  to  13  percent  margin  in  the  Metroplex.  The 
people  of  North  Texas  understand  that  unfettered  competition  benefits  consumers 
and they are clamoring for a resolution to this debate. This poll makes it clear that 
they do not want to continue with the status quo. 

Some  people  will  frame  the  Wright  Amendment  as  a  deal  that  should  be  upheld, 
but it is the duty of Congress to revise and change the law when circumstances dic-
tate.  No  law  is  so  sacrosanct  that  it  must  be  upheld  regardless  of  the  cost  to  the 
American people. Times are very different today compared to 1979 and the least we 
can do is thoroughly and objectively review this law. 

The only thing that is going to save our ailing domestic airline industry is healthy 
competition. Passengers deserve the most choices, the lowest fares, and the freedom 
to  choose  the  best  travel  routes  without  government  restrictions.  The  Wright 
Amendment’s time has past and we should tear down this artificial barrier to com-
petition and consumer choice. 

Thank you. 

Senator BURNS. Thank you. 
And Senator Pryor has joined us this morning. Senator Pryor, do 

you have a statement, or—— 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. You know I do, Mr. Chairman. And I think what 
I’d like to do is just submit it for the record to save time. But, also, 
I’d  like  to—I  have  an  airport  person  from  Texarkana,  Arkansas.  If 
I could submit their testimony for the record, as well. 

Senator BURNS. Without objection, we’ll certainly do that.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and thank you to all the pan-
elists  who  have  taken  time  to  come  and  share  their  views  and  concerns  regarding 
the Wright Amendment. 

As  you  know,  Arkansas  is  a  rural  state.  We  have  small  airports  and  no  hubs  in 
our  state.  With  that  said,  I  am  very  interested  to  hear  the  witnesses’  opinions  on 
how  a  potential  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  will  affect  small  airports  and 
small communities in my state and their transportation options. 

I do hear concern from some of my constituents that a repeal could reduce service. 
In  fact,  I  have  a  statement  from  Stephen  Luebbert,  the  Director  of  the  Texarkana 
Airport elaborating some of these concerns. I would like to ask consent to have this 
statement included in the record. 

Dallas  is  a  very  popular  destination  for  Arkansas’  businesspersons,  sports  fans, 
and travelers. It also is the closest hub airport for much of the state, providing con-
necting  flights  throughout  the  country  and  internationally.  It  is  in  the  interest  of 
both  Arkansas  and  Dallas  to  keep  this  relationship  strong,  and  I  look  forward  to

learning  more  from  our  panelists  as  to  the  possible  affects  that  might  result  from 
altering the current status quo. 

Once again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and thanks to all 
of the panelists who have shown up to help enlighten us on this issue. I am looking 
forward to a productive dialogue. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN LUEBBERT, AIRPORT DIRECTOR, 

TEXARKANA REGIONAL AIRPORT 

Mr.  Chairman,  members  of  the  Committee,  as  the  director  of  a  small  airport,  I 
thank you for the opportunity to express my concerns regarding the proposed repeal 
of the Wright Amendment. Serious and far reaching consequences are involved, not 
just for our region, but for our air transportation industry and the Nation it serves. 
Mr. Chairman, I support the Wright Amendment, as do many other airport direc-
tors  from  the  Heartland  of  America,  some  of  whom  are  here  with  me  today.  Tex-
arkana  Regional  Airport  is  one  of  the  smallest  commercial  airports  in  the  conti-
nental  United  States.  It  is  a  border  city  airport  jointly  owned  by  both  Texas  and 
Arkansas.  Our  Twin  Cities  of  Texarkana,  Arkansas  and  Texas  have  both  adopted 
resolutions  opposing  repeal.  These  formal  statements  of  opposition  are  in  response 
to concerns for the economic impact to the airport and surrounding four-state area. 
Ours is an area that is struggling to grow; an area where the average family income 
is  only  75  percent  of  the  national  average.  If  the  repeal  is  enacted  and  the  airport 
loses service, or worse—the airline, it will imperil the very existence of the airport. 
In a small town such as Texarkana, a commercial airport is a key factor in attract-
ing the new industry and growth we need. 

I  agree  with  American  Airlines  that  the  Wright  Amendment  has  served  the  Dal-
las/Fort Worth area well for years. Many small towns and cities have also benefited. 
Those  who  would  repeal  the  amendment  contend  the  issue  is  about  competition.  If 
the proponents of repeal want beneficial competition, the opportunity to compete has 
always  existed  at  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  (DFW)  Airport  where  any  airline  can  fly 
anywhere  it  chooses  without  triggering  wide-spread  economic  harm.  If  the  restric-
tion  is  lifted  and  Dallas  Love  is  permitted  long-haul  connections,  the  ensuing  com-
petition  will  be  far  from  beneficial.  In  the  repeal  scenario,  many  heartland  airports 
and communities will lose service as American realigns its flight schedule to match 
its  competitor’s  new  routing  from  Dallas  Love.  The  net  economic  ripple  effect  will 
have  a  profound  impact.  Apart  from  the  economic  damage  to  small  airports  and 
their cities, a precedent will be established when the Wright Amendment, a ‘‘perim-
eter rule’’ is set aside. 

Perimeter  rules  have  been  established  by  Federal,  State  and  local  governments 
to  moderate  competition  when  the  market’s  behavior  would  not  serve  the  public’s 
interest. When co-located commercial airports compete for scarce Federal resources, 
the  effect  is  to  diminish  the  funds  available  for  safety  and  infrastructure  renewal, 
to say nothing of the hazard associated with the shared airspace conflicts. For safety 
and fiscal reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration has guarded against approv-
ing  competing  airport  operations  if  one  airport  will  meet  the  area’s  needs.  Are  we 
ready  to  establish  a  precedent  that  vacates  perimeter  rules?  These  are  rules  that 
discipline  spending  and  enforce  good  public  policy.  These  are  the  rules  which  have 
contributed  to  the  finest  airport  network  in  the  world.  A  network  that  offers  vir-
tually every corner of the country access to the U.S. air transportation system. 

As  you  know,  when  the  Wright  Amendment  was  drafted,  it  was  a  compromise  to 
permit  Dallas  Love  to  remain  a  commercial  airport  while  minimizing  its  impact  on 
the  newly  constructed  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Airport.  Over  the  years,  with  Wright 
Amendment protection, DFW grew into a world-class hub. A subsidiary of American 
Airlines, American Eagle, reached into small-town America to extend global connec-
tions  to  the  home  front  via  DFW.  American  Eagle  has  been  a  catalyst  for  regional 
growth in the vicinity of Texarkana. 

American Eagle was and continues to be willing to serve small and mid-sized com-
munities,  areas  that  other  carriers,  especially  the  low-fare  airlines  would  not  con-
sider.  Whether  intended  or  not,  the  Wright  Amendment  has  moderated  the  market 
balance  of  air  service  in  the  central  U.S.  With  the  advent  of  a  low-fare  carrier  at 
Dallas Love, the restriction allowed a traditional carrier at DFW to continue serving 
our growing cities and towns. 

Repealing  the  rule  will  disturb  the  market  balance  that  has  evolved  over  the 
years. In the ensuing realignment, service will be lost; airline competition at smaller 
airports  will  diminish.  With  loss  of  carrier  competition,  comes  higher  fares  and  re-
duced  airport  business.  Small  airports  will  quickly  find  themselves  on  a  slippery 
slope. Communities will turn to State and Federal agencies for additional assistance

and  the  Essential  Air  Service  program  will  experience  new  demands.  Clearly,  the 
Wright  Amendment  was  not  intended  to  establish  a  market  balance  between  low- 
fare  carriers  and  traditional  carriers.  But  that  ‘‘service  symmetry’’  is  a  fact  of  life 
today,  and  repeal  will  have  costly,  unintended  and  unanticipated  consequences.  In 
the  military,  we  referred  to  this  type  of  maneuver  (repeal),  as  ‘‘calling  a  strike  on 
your own position.’’ Why, when there is so much at stake and so little to be gained 
by so few, would we want to do this? 

In  the  Twin  Cities  of  Texarkana,  American  Eagle  carries  the  majority  of  air  pas-
senger  traffic.  The  company’s  Texarkana  service  originated  in  1929  as  American 
Airways  operating  Ford  Tri-Motor  equipment.  American  Airlines  and  the  Twin  Cit-
ies have been partners since the beginning of commercial air service in the U.S. The 
low-fare  carriers  operate  on  a  business  model  that  precludes  service  to  all  but  the 
most lucrative markets. While this model has a very useful role to play in our indus-
try,  the  model  is  incompatible  with  service  beyond  major  population  centers.  Small 
airports are ‘‘no-fly-zones’’ for low-fare carriers. 

Only the traditional carriers continue to offer growing communities access to vital 
air  service.  If  the  repeal  is  enacted,  I  predict  the  quality,  safety  and  frequency  of 
service  to  grassroots  America  will  begin  to  fundamentally  change.  Unfettered  com-
petition can only lead to the atrophy of air service to small towns and mid-sized cit-
ies  where  the  profit  margin  is  already  very  thin.  Some  form  of  regulation  or  ex-
panded  government  subsidies  would  be  needed  to  preserve  non-hub  access  to  air 
service. In the competition for more passengers and cargo with lower overhead, the 
carriers  will  consolidate  in  the  major  population  centers.  Air  traffic  congestion  and 
delays will increase beyond the already intolerable levels. Security screening will be-
come an even greater challenge than it is today as more travelers seek to enter the 
system  at  major  hubs  because  reliever  airports  have  lost  regularly  scheduled  serv-
ice. 

I  ask  the  Committee  to  consider  not  only  the  near-term,  local  loss  of  service  that 
repeal  would  precipitate,  but  also  consider  the  long-range  and  potentially  far  more 
serious consequences of the decision—the exodus of reliable air service from all but 
the  major  hubs.  If  the  country’s  most  profitable  airline,  with  its  very  selective  ap-
proach  to  the  cities  it  serves,  is  exempt  from  operating  within  the  rules,  other  air-
lines can be expected to re-think their business strategies. Other existing perimeter 
rules will be challenged. Imposing new rules will become untenable. And the migra-
tion toward airport clusters in the urban centers will be underway. 

The Wright Amendment is good government. It was an effective compromise that 
has had the intended effect. DFW has successfully evolved as envisioned and its air-
lines link growing communities to the business world. 

Finally,  this  is  not  about  two  competing  airlines.  This  is  about  airports.  The  two 
airlines  will  survive  regardless  of  the  decision.  But  if  the  decision  is  to  repeal  the 
restriction, DFW Airport and nearly 100 smaller airports and their communities will 
suffer  primary  and  secondary  economic  impacts.  I  implore  you  to  keep  focused  on 
the  only  potential  losers  in  this  debate—the  airports  and  their  communities.  If  it 
were  possible  to  sum  up  their  losses  along  with  the  cost  to  the  government  to  pro-
vide  limited  air  service  where  it  will  be  vacated,  I  have  no  doubt  the  total  would 
far exceed any local benefits to North Texas or other states courting a Dallas-based 
discount  airline.  The  longer-range  effects  will  be  to  reduce  access  to  the  air  trans-
portation system for areas of the country that need it the most while adding to the 
congestion  and  delays  that  all  ready  plague  the  airspace  near  our  major  hubs.  The 
price of repeal is too high for too many. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  state 
my case. I stand ready to work with the Committee and staff in any way to resolve 
this complex issue. 

Senator  BURNS.  Senator  Bond,  thank  you  for  coming  this  morn-

bers  of  the  Subcommittee.  We  appreciate  your  willingness  to  hold 
a  hearing  on  this  Wright  Amendment.  And,  as  I  see,  my  good 
friend,  colleague,  and  partner  on  the  EPW  Committee  leaving, 
we’ve  written  a  highway  bill.  And  I  am  a  great  free-enterpriser.  It 
seems  to  me  that  free  enterprise  is  not  served  when  people  have

to  go  through  Oklahoma  City  to  change  planes  to  go  someplace 
else, not because of the market, not because the free-enterprise sys-
tem  makes  it  a  better  deal,  but  because  the  Wright  Amendment 
does.  So,  I  take  my  free-enterprise  credentials  very  seriously,  and 
second to none. And I would say there isn’t a lot of free enterprise 
when  Oklahoma  City  gets  all  this  traffic  that  is  required  to  come 
in and change planes to get out of Love Field. 

To  return  to  the  statement,  former  House  Speaker  Jim  Wright 
amended  the  International  Air  Transportation  Act,  as  has  been 
said, to limit the geographical area to which airlines based in Love 
Field  are  legally  permitted  to  provide  air  service,  and  to  limit  the 
ability to market beyond those limits, as Senator Ensign has point-
ed out. The purpose of the law was to protect fledgling Dallas/Fort 
Worth  Airport  and  its  tenant  airlines  from  competition.  Obviously, 
it  was  done  because  the  Speaker  of  the  House  was  from  that  re-
gion. 

I  respectfully  suggest  that  the  26-year-old  Wright  Amendment 
has  outlived  its  usefulness  and  has  no  place  in  Federal  aviation 
law  in  the  future.  I  am  unaware  of  any  other  law  which  limits,  as 
this  law  does,  commercial  operations  out  of  an  airport  to  a  geo-
graphic limited area. 

I  believe  the  Wright  Amendment  is  outdated,  anti-competitive 
and  anti-consumer.  At  the  request  of  the  Commerce  Committee 
Chairman, Senator Stevens, and Subcommittee Chairman Burns, I 
refrain from taking a major rewrite of the Wright Amendment dur-
ing  the  debate  on  the  2006  transportation  appropriations  bill,  and 
urge  this  Committee  to  review  the  issue  and  take  appropriate  ac-
tion. 

So, we thank the Committee for giving us the opportunity to ex-
press concerns that the Wright Amendment has on its ongoing neg-
ative impact on commercial air travel. 

First,  the  Wright  Amendment’s  outdated.  In  the  26  years  since 
the law has passed, commercial air travel has grown exponentially. 
Technologically, we’ve moved from paper tickets to travel agents to 
e-tickets,  as  the  Chairman  has  pointed  out.  DFW  has  grown  from 
a  brand-new  airport  serving  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  to  the  second- 
busiest  airport  in  the  U.S.,  sixth-busiest  in  the  world.  Usually,  if 
we  legislate,  we  try  to  protect  the  little  guy  against  a  dominant 
player.  In  this  case,  the  dominant  player,  DFW,  is  being  protected 
from the smaller guy. 

Second,  the  Wright  Amendment  is  anti-competitive,  driving  up 
travel  costs  and  resulting  in  time-consuming  and  inconvenient 
travel  options.  Several  months  ago,  The  Wall  Street  Journal  pub-
lished  an  editorial  entitled  ‘‘Free  Love’’  that  stated  ‘‘On  flights  in 
which  Southwest  competes  with  DFW  carriers  out  of  the  Dallas 
area,  Love  Field  fares,  on  average,  are  15  percent  cheaper.  A  lack 
of competition caused by the limitations of the Wright Amendment 
subjects  many  Americans  to  higher  air  prices  and  fewer  choices.’’ 
A  May  23,  2005,  St.  Louis  Post-Dispatch  editorial,  titled  ‘‘The 
Texas Two-Step,’’ highlights the higher fares caused by lack of com-
petition and states that American Airlines charges a lot more to fly 
to Dallas from St. Louis than to fly to other cities which are a com-
parable  distance  away.  The  editorial  goes  on  to  say  that  you  can

fly  American  to  Detroit,  Cleveland,  Oklahoma  City,  and  Columbus 
for 43 percent to 82 percent less than you will pay to fly to Dallas. 
The fact is not lost on my constituents, especially those who trav-
el  to  Dallas  on  business.  And,  yes,  I  have  a  dog  in  the  fight.  The 
Chairman  mentioned  the  dehubbing  of  Dallas  by  Delta.  St.  Louis 
was dehubbed, as a result of the change in air travel, by American, 
after  9/11.  And  our  air  service  has  been  hit  very  strongly.  Many 
Missouri  businesses,  individuals,  academic  institutions,  not-for- 
profits and other public civic organizations have written, asking us 
to change the Wright Amendment. 

And,  Mr.  Chairman,  obviously  there  will  be  some  from  Missouri 
in  here,  I  have  the  Kansas  City  Convention  and  Visitors  Bureau, 
Joplin  Regional  Airport,  Platte  County  Economic  Development— 
but  there  are  also  a  lot  of  interesting  letters  in  here  from  Texas— 
Lancaster  Texas  Chamber  of  Commerce,  let’s  see,  Amarillo  Cham-
ber of Commerce, Harlingen Chamber of Commerce, Wilmer Cham-
ber  of  Commerce,  Wilmer  Texas  Chamber  of  Commerce,  South 
Padre Island Chamber of Commerce, and letters from the San An-
tonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets. 

So,  this  is  a  national  issue.  This  is  not  just  what  is  the  interest 
of  some  important  special  interests  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area. 
This  has  implications  for  national  air  traffic,  and  the  commerce 
that goes with it. 

The Wright Amendment is anti-consumer. Roughly 85 percent of 
the  population  of  the  U.S.  lives  outside  the  restricted  Wright  serv-
ice  area.  And  a  person  traveling  to  or  from  Love  Field  on  a  com-
mercial  airline  can  only  travel  to  or  from  points  within  Texas  and 
seven  other  neighboring  States.  Airlines—as  has  been  pointed  out 
by  Senator  Ensign—cannot  even—based  in  Love  Field—cannot 
even  advertise  their  flights  to  consumers  beyond  the  eight-state 
area  dictated  by  the  Wright  Amendment.  No  other  airport  in  the 
United States is subject to such a draconian rule. 

My  constituents  can  only  get  around  it  by  completing  two  sepa-
rate  transactions  for  travel.  A  Missouri  businesswoman  traveling 
from  St.  Louis  to  Dallas  Field  must  spend  a  minimum  of  3  hours 
more traveling time than she would to fly to DFW, because she has 
to go someplace and change planes, buy another ticket, and get on. 
Two  tickets  instead  of  one.  The  person  has  to  arrive  at  the  con-
necting city, deboard, collect the baggage, recheck, and—himself or 
herself and the baggage, and go through security again. This is in-
convenient, it’s costly, it’s time-consuming. 

The  final  argument  for  the  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  is 
that  it  hurts  economic  development.  George  Will  pointed  out,  in  a 
June  5,  2005,  column  in  The  Washington  Post,  when  St.  Louis  en-
tered  the—when  Southwest  entered  the  Fort  Lauderdale  market, 
forcing  American  to  cut  fares  to  and  from  Miami,  American’s  pas-
sengers  and  revenue  increased.  As  the  Nation’s  busiest  airport, 
O’Hare, in Chicago, was not financially devastated when Southwest 
Airlines started offering flights out of Midwest. 

I strongly urge the Committee to re-examine this arcane, this un-
usual  and  anti-competitive  rule,  and  to  fix  legislation  to  deal  with 
it.  Dallas  Love  Field,  in  my  view,  is  the  only—to  my  knowledge— 
is  the  only  airport  in  America  where  airlines  that  serve  point  A, 
point  B,  and  point  C  cannot  sell  a  ticket  from  point  A  to  point  C.

In  our  competitive  free-market  society,  this  does  not  make  any 
sense. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  that  I  be  permitted  to  submit  a  full  state-
ment for the record. Editorials that I have mentioned, letters from 
civic  organizations  in  Texas  and  Missouri,  and  I  believe  there  are 
still  some  more  letters  coming  that  are—we  have  been  told  are  on 
the  way,  but,  due  to  the  mail  service  that  we  have  in  the  Capitol, 
they’ve  not  yet  arrived,  which  will  come  as  a  great  shock  to  many 
of you, but I would ask that these be included in the record for the 
review of staff and the Committee members. 

And  I  thank  the  Chair  and  the  members  of  the  Committee  for 

your hospitality. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Bond follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER S. ‘‘KIT’’ BOND, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 

Mr.  Chairman,  members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  your  willingness  to 

hold this hearing on the Wright Amendment. 

Former House Speaker Jim Wright amended the International Air Transportation 
Competition  Act  of  1979  to  limit  the  geographical  area  to  which  airlines  based  at 
Love Field in Dallas are legally permitted to provide air service. The purpose of the 
law  was  to  protect  the  fledgling  Dallas-Fort  Worth  Airport  and  its  tenant  airlines 
from competition. 

I  respectfully  suggest  that  the  26-year-old  Wright  Amendment  has  outlived  its 
usefulness  and  has  no  place  in  Federal  aviation  law  in  the  future.  The  Wright 
Amendment is outdated, anti-competitive and anti-consumer. 

At  the  request  of  the  Commerce  Committee  Chairman,  Senator  Stevens,  and  the 
Subcommittee  Chairman,  Senator  Burns,  I  refrained  from  acting  on  the  Wright 
Amendment during debate over the FY06 Transportation appropriations bill to give 
this Committee the opportunity to review the issue and propose appropriate action. 
And  so  I  thank  the  Chairman,  Senator  Rockefeller,  and  the  Ranking  Member,  for 
giving  me  the  opportunity  to  express  my  concerns  about  the  Wright  Amendment 
and its ongoing negative impact on commercial air travel. 

There are several arguments for repeal of the Wright Amendment. 
First,  it  is  outdated.  In  the  26  years  since  the  law  was  passed,  commercial  air 
travel  has  grown  exponentially.  Technologically  we  have  moved  from  paper  tickets 
issued  through  travel  agents  to  e-tickets  purchased  online.  DFW  has  grown  from  a 
brand  new  airport  serving  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  to  the  second  busiest  airport  in 
the U.S. and the sixth busiest in the world. Usually we try to protect the little guy 
against  a  dominant  player.  In  this  case  the  dominant  player,  DFW,  is  being  pro-
tected from the smaller guy. 

Second, the Wright Amendment is anti-competitive, driving up travel costs and re-

sulting in time-consuming and inconvenient travel options. 

Several  months  ago,  the  Wall  Street  Journal  published  an  editorial  titled  Free 
Love  that  stated,  ‘‘On  flights  in  which  Southwest  competes  with  DFW  carriers  out 
of the Dallas area, Love Field fares are on average 15 percent cheaper.’’ 

Citing American Airlines’ own website, the Dallas Business Journal in an August 
2005 article pointed out that a round-trip ticket on American from DFW to Philadel-
phia  on  short  notice  costs  roughly  $1,198,  while  a  round-trip  ticket  on  American 
from  Houston  to  Philadelphia  on  short  notice  costs  roughly  $369.  That  is  a  dif-
ference of over $800! 

The  lack  of  competition  caused  by  the  Wright  Amendment  subjects  most  Ameri-
cans  to  higher  air  prices  and  fewer  choices.  Airlines  that  operate  from  DFW  hold 
a  virtual  monopoly  of  flights  between  Dallas  and  Lambert/St.  Louis  International 
Airport and Kansas City International Airport. 

According  to  a  Campbell  Hill  study,  based  on  data  compiled  by  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation,  the  DFW  fare  for  a  non-stop  flight  to  St.  Louis  averages 
$178. A probable Southwest fare for the same flight would cost only $110. Likewise, 
the current average DFW fare for a non-stop flight to Kansas City is $191. A prob-
able Southwest Airlines fare for the same flight would be around $108. 

A  May  23,  2005,  St.  Louis  Post-Dispatch  editorial  titled  ‘‘The  Texas  Two  Step’’ 
also highlights the higher fares caused by the lack of competition resulting from the 
Wright Amendment. The editorial states that American Airlines charges a lot more 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

19 

to  fly  to  Dallas  from  St.  Louis  than  to  fly  to  other  cities  which  are  a  comparable 
distance away. The editorial goes on to say that, ‘‘ You can fly American to Detroit, 
Cleveland, Oklahoma City and Columbus for 43 to 82 percent less than you will pay 
to go to Dallas.’’ 

This  fact  is  not  lost  on  my  constituents,  especially  those  who  travel  to  Dallas  on 
business. Many Missouri businesses, individuals, academic institutions, not for-prof-
its  and  other  public  and  civic  organizations  have  written  asking  for  changes  to  the 
Wright  Amendment.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  that  these  letters  be  submitted  for  the 
record. 

Third, the Wright Amendment is anti-consumer. 
Roughly  85  percent  of  the  U.S.  population  lives  outside  the  restricted  eight  state 

Wright Service Area. 

Under the Wright Amendment, a person traveling to or from Love Field on a com-
mercial airline can only travel to or from points within Texas and seven other neigh-
boring  states:  Louisiana,  Arkansas,  Oklahoma,  New  Mexico,  Alabama,  Mississippi 
and Kansas. 

This  means  air  travel  from  cities  like  Boston,  New  York,  St.  Louis,  or  Miami— 
virtually  anywhere  outside  the  ‘‘Wright  Amendment  Service  Area’’—to  Love  Field 
can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to schedule. 

In  addition  to  restricting  the  geographic  area  to  which  Love  Field  flights  can  le-
gally  serve,  the  amendment  contains  ‘‘through  ticketing’’  or  marketing  restrictions. 
Airlines based at Love Field cannot even advertise their flights to consumers beyond 
the eight state area dictated by the Wright Amendment. 

For  example,  a  Love  Field  customer  who  needs  to  fly  to  St.  Louis  and  is  willing 
to make a brief stop in Little Rock before continuing cannot buy a ticket due to the 
Wright Amendment. 

No other airport in the United States is subject to such a draconian rule. 
My  constituents  can  only  get  around  the  Wright  Amendment  by  completing  two 
separate  transactions  for  travel.  They  must  buy  one  ticket  to  a  destination  within 
the Wright Service Area, such as Little Rock. Then, after their plane lands in Little 
Rock;  they  must  deplane,  collect  their  baggage,  buy  another  ticket  to  Dallas  Love 
Field, go through security again, and then board another plane to Dallas. 

This  can  take  a  Missouri  businessman  traveling  from  St.  Louis  to  Dallas  Love 
Field  a  minimum  of  3  hours  more  traveling  time  than  it  would  to  fly  to  DFW  air-
port. 

Not  surprisingly  this  convoluted,  costly,  inconvenient  and  time  consuming  option 

does not appeal to many travelers—especially those traveling on business. 

Public opinion is against the Wright Amendment. Opposition is not limited to just 
Missouri and other states outside the ‘‘Service Area.’’ There is also significant oppo-
sition within the State of Texas including the Dallas Metropolitan area. 

A  survey  conducted  last  month  on  the  Wright  Amendment  by  Public  Opinion 
Strategies  of  Alexandria,  Virginia  indicated  that  82  percent  of  the  North  Texans 
who  were  polled  favored  repealing  the  Wright  Amendment.  In  addition  to  this, 
roughly  250,000  Texans  have  signed  petitions  asking  for  the  repeal  of  the  Wright 
Amendment. 

Dallas  Mayor  Laura  Miller  told  the  Wall  Street  Journal,  ‘‘Citizens  are  screaming 

to lift the Wright Amendment.’’ 

More  than  20  Texas  organizations  have  passed  resolutions  or  taken  positions  in 
support of repeal of the Wright Amendment. Many newspapers in Texas and across 
the  country  have  written  editorials  in  support  of  repeal,  including  the  Dallas  Busi-
ness Journal, the Houston Chronicle, The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, 
the Los Angeles Times, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Kansas City Star. I ask 
that these resolutions and editorials be submitted for the record. 

Another  argument  for  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  is  that  it  hurts  economic 

development. 

Some  argue  that  changing  the  Wright  Amendment  would  financially  devastate 
DFW  Airport,  American  Airlines  and  the  North  Texas  economy.  This  view  is  coun-
tered by the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce Task Force on the Wright Amend-
ment,  which  describes  the  amendment  as  ‘‘bad  for  the  City’s  economy,’’  saying,  ‘‘its 
repeal would provide a billion-dollar a year economic boost.’’ The Task Force Report 
also states that ‘‘the law is choking Dallas’ growth by keeping the airfares high and 
hurting the city’s convention business and tourism.’’ 

The  argument  that  repeal  will  hurt  economic  growth  ignores  the  experience  of 
other cities. As George Will points out in a June 5, 2005, column in The Washington 
Post, ‘‘When Southwest entered the Ft. Lauderdale market, forcing American to cut 
fares to and from Miami, American’s passengers and revenue increased.’’

Roger King of the independent debt research firm Credit Sights observes, ‘‘If and 
when  it  [Wright  repeal]  happens,  there  will  be  an  increase  in  the  Dallas/Ft.  Worth 
economy through higher passenger counts.’’ 

The  Nation’s  busiest  airport,  O’Hare  in  Chicago  was  not  financially  devastated 

when Southwest Airlines started offering flights out of Midway Airport. 

A number of large cities across the country have the market to support more than 

one airport: Dallas is one of them. 

I  strongly  urge  this  Committee  to  re-examine  this  arcane  and  anti-competitive 
rule, and to craft legislation to fix it. Dallas Love Field is the only airport in Amer-
ica where airlines that serve Point A, Point B and Point C cannot sell a ticket from 
Point A to Point C. And in our competitive free market society, this simply does not 
make sense. 

Senator  BURNS.  I  thank  you,  Senator  Bond.  And  I  would  correct 
your  indication  of  an  airport  in  Chicago  from  Midwest  to  Midway. 

Senator BOND. Midway. 
Senator BURNS. Old Midway Airport. 
Senator BOND. Sorry. Thank you. I thank the—— 
Senator BURNS. That’s all—— 
Senator BOND.—the knowledgeable Chair. 
Senator BURNS.—that’s all right. 
We  have  with  us  our  guests  this  morning,  and  happy  to  have 
them:  The  Honorable  Eddie  Bernice  Johnson,  the  gentlelady  from 
the 30th District of Texas. 

And, Congresswoman, we welcome you here this morning. 

STATEMENT OF HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS 

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Chairman Burns, and to all 
of  the  distinguished  members  of  the  Committee,  including  Senator 
Bond, whom I disagree with most of what he has said. 

[Laughter.] 
Ms.  JOHNSON.  But  we’ve  done  that  before,  and,  at  the  end,  we 

usually come together. 

The  subject  before  us  is  of  great  importance  to  my  congressional 
district, where Love Field is located. And I appreciate today’s hear-
ing  on  the  Wright  Amendment.  It  is  my  hope  that  the  dialog  de-
rived from today underscores at least one fundamental notion, that, 
in  the  absence  of  a  local  consensus,  I  would  hope  that  Congress 
would  not  pre-empt  the  local  authority  of  the  cities  of  Dallas  and 
Fort Worth. 

The Wright Amendment was intended to provide a fair and equi-
table  solution  to  a  local  airport  dispute.  When  these  airports— 
when  DFW  was  built,  both  Meachum  and  Love  Field  were  sup-
posed  to  close  to  commercial  traffic.  The  agreement  between  the 
cities  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  had  to  do  with  a  covenant  on  the 
bonds.  And  the  balance  between  our  airports  has  served  North 
Texas very well. And we hope it will not be disturbed. 

I deeply regret that a divisive issue has drained so much energy 
and expended countless resources over the past decade. The reason 
I  took  a  strong  position  is  because  9  or  10  years  ago  this  issue 
came up before, and I serve on the Transportation Committee, and 
I  have—now  in  my  seventh  term—been  trying  to  get  the  cities  to 
work  together  on  a  regional  transportation  plan.  They’re  27  miles 
apart.  The  agreement  was,  no  airport  would  be  within  21  miles  of 
each other. Love Field and DFW are 8 miles apart.

Love  Field  is  in  a  residential  area.  The  agreement  and  spirit  of 
cooperation between the two cities embodied the contractual estab-
lishment of DFW, and it would be undermined, and do irreparable 
harm, if we changed it, because of the environment, the safety, the 
quality  of  life  of  the  constituents  surrounding  the  airport  who  vig-
orously agree—disagree for more traffic. 

We have 63 schools and 30,000 students in this residential area. 
And that was all thought about 32 years ago. And that’s when Dal-
las  and  Fort  Worth  came  together  as  the  two  cities,  and  the  may-
ors,  and  all  the  city  council  people  signed  this  covenant  that  they 
would phaseout Love Field commercial traffic, as well as Meachum, 
and Redbird Airport, another airport. 

When  Southwest  Airlines—and  let  me  assure  you  that  I  have 
great  respect  for  Southwest  Airlines.  I  use  it.  I  think  that  Herb 
Kelleher  is  one  of  the  most  brilliant  businesspeople  I’ve  ever  met. 
He has brought forth one of the—the most profitable airline in the 
Nation.  But  I  do  not  want  the  destabilization  to  come  to  the  DFW 
Airport. 

The  DFW  Airport  has  been  the  economic  engine  for  the  area.  If 
you  look  around  that  airport,  you  will  see  that  many  national  and 
international businesses have been established. And that’s because 
you  can  go  to  DFW  Airport  and  fly  anywhere  in  the  Nation  in  a 
3-hour  period.  Using  American,  you  can  connect  to  the  world  with 
ease.  We  are  an  international  trade  location.  And  that’s  one  of  the 
draws to the area. 

If this repeal comes, it will destabilize the area. It was an agree-
ment, as a compromise, that both the city leadership, the constitu-
ents,  the  City  of  Fort  Worth,  the  City  of  Dallas,  all  came  together 
to agree on so that Love Field could have commercial traffic. Nine-
ty-seven  percent  of  that  traffic  is  by  Love  Field—is  by  Southwest 
Airlines.  And  I  believe  that  repealing  the  Wright  Amendment 
would undermine the 2001 master plan adopted by the city of Dal-
las.  The  plan  calls  for  very  limited,  managed  growth.  The  plan  is 
a  direct  result  of  outspoken  opposition  to  airport  growth  from  the 
communities near the airport. 

And I’m going to close, and I’m just sketching over my statement 

here, which I will leave for the record. 

I am not anticompetition, I am not anti-Love-Field fares, nor am 
I  anti-free-enterprise,  but  I  am  pro-principle.  And  it  is  my  belief 
that  the  Wright  Amendment  stands  as  a  principled  agreement  be-
tween  two  cities  to  protect  the  region’s  primary  air-traffic  invest-
ment.  And,  for  the  good  of  the  North  Texas  region,  I  respectfully 
urge my House and Senate colleagues not to pre-empt the local au-
thority of the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth. 

We are like twin cities. We have to work together. This issue di-

vides us. And I would ask you to please understand that. 

I  want  to  reiterate  my  appreciation  to  the  Subcommittee  for  the 
opportunity to provide testimony, and I ask that my full testimony 
be submitted for the permanent record. 

And I thank you very much. 
Senator  BURNS.  Without  objection,  your  statement  will  be  made

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS 

Chairman  Burns,  Ranking  Member  Rockefeller,  members  of  the  Subcommittee, 

thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony this morning. 

The  subject  before  us  is  one  of  great  importance  to  my  Congressional  district 

where Love Field is located. 

While I appreciate today’s hearing on the Wright Amendment, it is my hope that 
the dialogue derived from today underscores at least one fundamental notion: in the 
absence  of  a  local  consensus,  the  Congress  should  not  preempt  the  local  authority  of 
the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth on a local issue. 

The  Wright  Amendment  was  intended  to  provide  a  fair  and  equitable  solution  to 
a  local  airport  dispute.  The  agreement  was  agreed  to  by  Southwest  Airlines,  the 
City of Dallas, the City of Fort Worth. the DFW Airport Authority, and related con-
stituency groups. 

This  balance  between  our  two  airports  has  served  the  North  Texas  community 

well and should not be disturbed unless at the behest of local leaders. 

I  deeply  regret  that  a  divisive  issue  that  has  drained  so  much  energy  and  ex-
pended countless resources over the past decades has reemerged at a time when the 
sister cities of Dallas and Fort Worth have enjoyed unprecedented levels of coopera-
tion on a wide array of challenges facing the North Texas region. 

Over  the  past  12  months,  much  has  been  said  and  publicized  that  frames  the 

Wright Amendment debate between two airlines. 

I  do  not  concur.  It  is  my  view  that  this  legislation  was,  and  is,  the  direct  result 

of a community crafted compromise regarding two North Texas airports. 

Given the current state of the aviation sector, I feel strongly that should this com-
promise  be  subject  to  a  preemptive  repeal  or  modification:  (1)  the  agreement  and 
spirit of cooperation between Dallas and Fort Worth embodied in the contractual es-
tablishment  of  DFW  Airport  would  be  undermined;  (2)  irreparable  harm  could  be 
brought  upon  the  North  Texas  economy  resulting  from  an  already  weakened  DFW 
Airport;  and  (3)  the  safety  and  quality  of  life  for  my  constituents,  who  live  around 
Love Field and have entrusted the airport to operate solely as a short-haul airport, 
would diminish greatly. 

Thirty  two  years  ago,  North  Texas,  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Civil  Aero-
nautics  Board,  decided  that  DFW  Airport  would  be  the  region’s  primary  air  travel 
investment. 

As  part  of  the  airports  funding  arrangement,  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  adopted  the 
1968  Regional  Airport  Concurrent  Bond  Ordinance,  which,  among  other  things 
called for the phase out of the cities’ respective airports—including Love Field. 

A  subsequent  turn  of  events  allowed  Southwest  to  continue  utilizing  Love  Field 
for the purpose of intrastate operations as long as the airport remained operational. 
Enactment of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, prompted concerns from local 

officials about DFW’s future and financial stability. 

In  response  to  this,  in  lieu  of  closing  Love  Field,  the  Wright  Amendment  was 
crafted to protect the interests of DFW Airport, and particularly those of Southwest 
Airlines. 

To state that stability at DFW Airport is critical to the overall health and success 
of  the  North  Texas  economy  is  an  understatement.  As  the  airport  has  grown,  the 
North Texas economy has followed lock and step. 

The  airport  has  been  a  catalyst  for  job  growth,  a  magnet  for  luring  corporations 
to  the  region,  and  a  level  playing  field  for  minority  and  women  owned  businesses. 
According  to  the  Aviation  Division  of  the  Texas  Department  of  Transportation, 
when  combined  with  the  multiplier  effect,  DFW  International  Airport  generates 
roughly $14.3 billion in economic output, 268,000 jobs, and $6 billion in payroll. This 
type of economic generation should not be jeopardized. 

In  the  event  of  Wright  Amendment  repeal,  I  have  great  concern  about  the  possi-
bility  of  adverse  impacts  to  safety  and  the  quality  of  life  for  my  constituents  that 
live around Love Field. 

Love  Field  is  physically  constrained  by  surrounding  residential  neighborhoods, 
schools, churches, and hospitals. Increased air traffic congestion immediately brings 
into  question  the  margin  of  error  for  pilots  and  air  traffic  controllers,  increased 
noise pollution, and traffic gridlock in an area that is already constricted. 

Further, repealing the Wright Amendment would also undermine the 2001 Master 
Plan adopted by the City of Dallas. The Plan calls for very limited, managed growth. 
This Plan is the direct result of outspoken opposition to airport growth from com-

munities near the airport. 

In my view, the prevailing arguments and concerns for this locally generated com-

promise are just as relevant today as they were 32 years ago.

I have the utmost admiration for Herb Kelleher and Gary Kelly. Under their col-
lective  stewardship,  Southwest  has  posted  32  consecutive  years  of  profitable  oper-
ations and commands roughly 97 percent of the Love Field market. 

Over the 30 I have known Herb Kelleher, I have come to view him as an excellent 

He knows I appreciate the positive impact Southwest Airlines has had on my dis-

trict and Dallas, but this debate is ill-timed. 

In  closing,  I  understand  that  there  are  segments  who  may  feel  that  the  Wright 
Amendment has served its time and serves merely as a roadblock to lower fares and 
free enterprise. 

I  respectfully  disagree,  and  I  want  each  of  these  respective  segments  to  know:  I 
am  not  anti-competition;  I  am  not  anti-lower  fares;  nor  am  I  anti-free  enterprise. 
I  am,  however,  pro-principle,  and  it  is  my  belief  that  the  Wright  Amendment 
stands as a principled agreement between two cities to protect the region’s primary 
air travel investment. 

For the good of the North Texas region, I respectfully urge my House and Senate 
colleagues not to preempt the local authority of the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth 
on a local issue. 

This  concludes  my  remarks.  I  want  to  reiterate  my  appreciation  to  the  Sub-
committee  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  testimony  and  ask  that  my  full  testimony 
be submitted for the permanent record of today’s proceedings. 

businessman. 

Thank you. 

Senator BURNS. We have been joined by the former Chairman of 

the full Committee of the Commerce, Senator McCain. 
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN MCCAIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’ll  be 

very brief. Thank you for holding this hearing. 

I  believe  that  the  Wright  Amendment  should  be  repealed,  be-
cause  we  should  act  to  encourage  competition,  and  the  consumer 
benefits  that  result  from  it.  I  have  held  that  position  for  many 
years.  But  I  hope  we  won’t  stop  with  a  repeal  of  the  amendment. 
I  believe  we  should  remove  all  other  artificial  barriers  to  competi-
tion  in  the  airline  industry,  such  as  the  perimeter  rule,  that  keep 
airfares  high,  reduce  consumer  choices,  and  limit  the  number  of 
markets that are served. 

As  you  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  original  purpose  of  the  perim-
eter  rule  was  to  promote  LaGuardia  and  Washington  National  as 
airports  for  business  travelers  flying  to  and  from  the  East  Coast 
and  Midwest  cities  and  to  promote  traffic  to  other  airports  by  di-
verting long-haul flights to Newark and Kennedy Airports and Dul-
les Airport. We all know that that’s changed dramatically. 

And I want to say, as I support the repeal of the Wright Amend-

ment, I also strongly support the repeal of the perimeter rule. 

I thank the witnesses for being here today, and I know that this 
is  a  very  emotional  and  tough  issue  for  our  friends  from  the  State 
of  Texas,  as  well,  but  I  would  say  to  Congresswoman  Johnson,  it 
doesn’t only affect the State of Texas what flies in and out of Love 
or  Dallas/Fort  Worth,  but  people  of  Arizona,  as  well  as  almost 
every other state in America. 

I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing, and I thank 

the witnesses today for appearing. 

Thank you. 
Senator  BURNS.  I  want  to  thank  the  Honorable  Kay  Granger, 
who is United States Congresswoman, 12th District of Texas. And, 
the  gentlelady,  thank  you  for  coming  this  morning.  Sorry,  we  get 
a little long-winded on this side, as you well know.

[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS. But thank you for coming this morning. We look 

forward to your testimony. 

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY GRANGER, 
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS 

Ms.  GRANGER.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Burns  and  Senator 
Hutchison, Members of the Subcommittee. I thank you for opening 
for  discussion  this  complex  and,  we  think,  a  very  important  issue. 
Some  of  the  people  who  oppose  change  to  the  Wright  Amend-
ment,  they  say,  ‘‘A  deal’s  a  deal.’’  That’s  what  we  say  in  Texas.  I 
wasn’t  around  when  the  deal  was  made,  but  I’ve  been  involved  in 
enforcing this deal now for about 15 years as mayor of Fort Worth, 
as a member of the DFW board and now as a Member of Congress. 
Senator  Hutchison  gave  the  history  very  well.  It’s  important  to 
remember  that  the  two  cities  had  separate  airports,  and  those  air-
ports  served  the  cities  well.  It  was  not  the  cities  that  decided  to 
change  that,  it  was—I’d  call  it  a  shotgun  wedding,  because  it  was 
forced  on  us,  but  it  took  incredible  political  courage  and  very  good 
planning  to  come  together  and  build  this  regional  airport,  DFW 
International  Airport.  And  it’s  worked.  And  it’s  worked  very  well. 
Part of that, of course, was that we’d shut down our separate air-
ports. And the airport that was closest to what is DFW today, that 
was owned by Fort Worth, Greater Southwest, was shut down and 
torn  down.  It  does  not  exist.  And  they  followed  that  agreement. 
However, because Southwest, then, was not a party to that, and re-
fused to move, then it started the whole thing up, and the two cit-
ies went to the courtroom and began this long battle. 

It’s  important  to  remember  that  happened.  And  Congressman 
Johnson  talked  about  the  covenants,  the  two  cities—the  covenants 
that  neither  city  would  do  anything  to  hurt  the  ultimate  develop-
ment  of  DFW  Airport.  And  those  covenants,  the  violation  of  those 
covenants, has been very important. 

When  Love  Field  couldn’t  close  down,  because  Southwest 
wouldn’t  move,  and  won  the  lawsuit,  then  we  went  back  to  those 
covenants  and  back  to  the  courthouse.  The  agreement,  the  com-
promise, the deal, as we call it, that was arrived, was arrived with 
the  two  cities,  DFW  Airport,  and  Southwest.  It  was  written  into 
law by Jim Wright. I would argue that it’s served us well. I would 
also argue that it’s allowed Southwest to grow and prosper because 
of that legislation, that protection. 

Let’s fast-forward, though, now to today. DFW is responsible, di-
rectly  or  indirectly,  for  200,000  jobs.  It’s  been  extremely  important 
to  the  economy  of  North  Texas.  But  everyone  in  this  room  knows 
how  airlines  and  airports  have  suffered  since  September  11th. 
DFW,  however,  has  suffered  some  other  blows.  When  Delta  pulled 
out of the airport, they pulled their hub out, they emptied 20 gates, 
lost 239 daily flights. And that was when DFW was going through 
a  major,  very  expensive  expansion.  I  think  another  blow  to  that 
airport would be a change today in this Wright Amendment. 

The  second  thing  I  think  is  most  important  to  remember  is  that 
Southwest  Airlines  is  not  restricted.  It  is  not  restricted,  as  it 
claims. Southwest can fly without restrictions, without altering the 
law in any way, can fly wherever their markets determine they can

fly.  No  one  needs  to  free  Southwest  Airlines,  because  it’s  free.  All 
it has to do is move to DFW International Airport, fill those empty 
gates, and fly to new markets. 

I  would  remind  you  that  Southwest,  although  they’ve  said  it 
doesn’t  fit  their  business  plan,  they  compete  toe  to  toe  with  other 
legacy  airlines  at  major  airports  across  the  country.  Philadelphia 
competes against U.S. Airways; 379 flights, it has. It’s increased its 
flight  frequency  by  257  percent  over  the  past  year.  Southwest  also 
flies  out  of  Los  Angeles  International,  with  121  flights,  competing 
against  United.  It  also  competes  right  in  my  home  State  of  Texas, 
in  Houston,  against  Continental,  where  Southwest  ranks  it  as  one 
of its ten top cities, 145 flights. 

In  the  marketplace,  you  know,  it’s  survival  of  the  fittest.  Now 
going  to  Denver,  that  is  predicted  to  add  45  million  passengers 
next  year  with  the  addition  of  Southwest  to  Denver.  It  seems  that 
Southwest is selective in saying what meets their model. 

I  would  say  that  DFW  has  laid  out  the  red  carpet,  offering  22 
million  in  incentives  for  Southwest  Airlines  to  bring  its  service  to 
that  airport  and  make  the  whole  region  stronger,  and  certainly 
DFW  International  Airport.  That,  to  me,  is  a  solution—not  chang-
ing  the  law,  not  changing  things,  particularly  at  this  very,  very 
sensitive time for DFW. 

I  urge  you,  Senators,  to  maintain  what  has  worked,  what  con-
tinues  to  work,  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  agreement  and  the 
ability of the region to decide its future and its needs. 

Thank you for your attention. 
Senator BURNS. Thank you very much. 
Now  we’re  joined  with,  and  happy  to  have,  Jeb  Hensarling,  5th 
District  of  Texas.  And,  Congressman,  thank  you  for  coming  this 
morning. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JEB HENSARLING, 

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS 

Mr.  HENSARLING.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Burns,  Senator 
Hutchison,  members  of  the  Subcommittee.  Thank  you  very  much 
for  allowing  me  to  testify.  Thank  you  very  much  for  holding  this 
important hearing. 

On  May  26,  along  with  my  colleague  Sam  Johnson,  the  other 
Johnson  from  Texas,  I  used  the  Right  to  Fly  Act,  H.R.  2646.  It’s 
a bipartisan bill with over 40 co-sponsors representing 18 different 
states.  I  salute  Senators  Ensign  and  Senator  McCain  for  intro-
ducing similar legislation in this body. 

I believe it is right to repeal Wright. I think it is wrong for Con-
gress  to  protect  one  airport  from  the  competition  of  another  and 
hurt consumers in the process. 

The  harm  of  the  Wright  Amendment  extends  beyond  North 
Texas.  It  limits  economic  growth  around  the  Nation,  while  artifi-
cially  increasing  the  price  of  airline  tickets  between  destinations, 
making it harder to travel for business, pleasure, or necessity. 

Today, as you know, there are over 500 airports in America with 
commercial  air  service.  With  the  exception  of  Reagan  National, 
which  sits  on  Federal  property,  Congress  has  only  once—only 
once—placed  distance  limitations  on  an  airport.  That  airport,  of 
course, is Love Field, in my hometown of Dallas, Texas.

Congress imposed those restrictions to protect DFW Airport from 
the  competition  of  Love  Field.  I  believe  this  is  not,  and  should  not 
be, the role of Congress. Competition is the consumer’s best friend. 
Our  Nation  has  over  200  years  of  history  to  prove  it  and  gives  us 
the  goods  and  services  we  want  at  the  lowest  possible  cost.  Ford 
sells  F–150  pickups  for  about  $30,000.  I’m  sure  they’ve  love  to 
charge  us  $60,000,  but  Dodge,  Chevy,  and  Toyota  make  sure  that 
doesn’t happen. Competition works. Freedom works. 

There  was  a  time  when  Congress  regulated  prices  and  services 
in  many  industries—trucking,  long  distance,  and  air  travel,  to 
name a few. But, as a result of allowing competition, real prices fell 
in  these  industries  between  15  and  40  percent  over  3  to  5  years. 
And consumers enjoyed greater choices and technological advances. 
We need to finish the job of promoting competition in air travel. 

Now,  every  study  dealing  with  the  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amend-
ment,  regardless  of  the  party  that  commissioned  it,  will  all  show 
that fares will fall if we pass this legislation. Now, the U.S. Depart-
ment  of  Transportation,  clearly  a  party  fairly  unbiased  in  this  de-
bate,  found  that  in  2004  North  Texans  paid  a  third  more  for  their 
long-distance  air  travel  than  the  national  average.  That’s  a  third 
more.  That’s  a  lot  of  money  which  families  could  have  used  to  pay 
for  healthcare  premiums,  fill  up  a  car,  or  pay  a  heating  bill.  With 
lower  airfares,  a  grandmother  in  Iowa  will  be  able  to  visit  her 
grandchild in Dallas twice a year instead of once. A factory worker 
in Kentucky will pay 2 days of wages instead of 4 to fly to his son’s 
college graduation at the University of Texas at Arlington. A small- 
business owner from Mesquite, Texas, in my district, can meet face 
to face with a supplier in California. 

I  believe  no  defense  of  the  Wright  Amendment  is  as  compelling 
as Congress’s responsibility to support Americans who are working 
hard to make ends meet. 

Now, today you have heard some say that Dallas and Fort Worth 
had  an  agreement  25  years  ago  to  close  Love  Field  and  that  Con-
gress  must  enforce  it.  I  ask  the  question,  Is  this  the  business  of 
Congress? There have been multiple State and Federal lawsuits at-
tempting  to  force  the  closure  of  Love  Field,  and  none  have  been 
successful.  Clearly,  the  courts  have  not  found  this  binding  agree-
ment,  and  the  matter  has  been  appealed  all  the  way  to  the  U.S. 
Supreme Court. You have also heard today that Southwest Airlines 
has  the  right  to  compete  now  as  long  as  they  do  it  from  DFW. 
That’s like Congress saying to McDonalds, ‘‘You can sell your entire 
menu of hamburgers all around the Nation, except in Topeka, Kan-
sas. There, you’re restricted to selling Chicken McNuggets, because 
Burger King needs to make more money.’’ 

Also,  current  concerns  about  safety  and  increased  noise,  I  be-
lieve,  are  unfounded.  When  the  Wright  Amendment  is  repealed, 
Love Field will continue to be subject to exactly the same FAA reg-
ulations  that  maintain  safety  and  environmental  standards  at 
every other commercial airport in this country. 

Now,  some  may  say  that  the  timing  of  a  repeal  may  be  bad  for 
particular  airlines.  But  should  we  wait  until  some  healthy  airlines 
become unhealthy? 

And  what  about  the  over-half-a-million  North  Texas  small  busi-
nesses that would benefit immediately from increased travel in the

region?  They  are  the  true  job  engine  of  the  economy.  Not  a  single 
airline, and not a single airport. 

And, Mr. Chairman, I understand that airlines face serious chal-
lenges.  And  I  think  Congress  should  address  them  by  promoting 
energy policies to help reduce the cost of jet fuel, by helping Amer-
ican  workers  grow  their  paychecks  so  that  they  can  afford  to  fly 
more  often,  and  by  taking  action  on  legacy  pension  systems.  But 
artificially raising prices on hardworking Americans is not the way 
to help. 

The  way  to  right  this  wrong  and  help  both  consumers  and  our 
economy  is  to  repeal  the  Wright  Amendment.  Congress  passed  it. 
Only  Congress  can  repeal  it.  I  urge  this  Committee  to  take  swift 
action and remove the unfair Wright Amendment. 

I thank you for this opportunity to testify. 
Senator BURNS. Thank you for coming this morning. 
And I have no questions for this panel. 
Senator Hutchison? 
Senator HUTCHISON. No, thanks. 
Senator BURNS. Senator Ensign? 
Senator ENSIGN. Just one. 
Congresswoman  Johnson,  you  had  mentioned  consensus,  and  I 
just  wanted  to  know  whether  you  had  seen  the  survey  by  Public 
Opinion  Strategies.  They’re  one  of  the  most  well-respected  polling 
firms.  I  don’t  believe  in  making  law  based  on  polls,  but  as  far  as 
to  get  the  opinion  of  the  people  who  live  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth 
area,  they  had  run  a  poll  recently,  and  found  that  repeal  of  the 
Wright  Amendment  is  favored  by  an  82  to  13  margin  in  the 
Metroplex area. Now, I don’t normally—you know, OK, if polls can 
be a few points off, even if this one’s a few points off, it sounds like 
that—maybe  some  of  the  leaders  in  the  area  don’t  have  a  con-
sensus,  but  it  sounds  like,  to  me,  that’s  a  pretty  good  consensus. 
You  don’t  see  numbers  this  high  very  often  on  any  issue.  Sounds 
like  the  people  who  live  in  the  area  have  a  pretty  good  consensus 
that they would like to see the repeal of this amendment. 

Ms. JOHNSON. I’d be delighted to comment on that. It depends on 
who you poll. It is clear to me that the people that live around Love 
Field  have  not  been  polled.  They  are  very,  very  together  on  not 
wanting  more  traffic  at  Love  Field.  So,  it  doesn’t  impress  me  that 
others  around  the  area—it  does  impress  me  that  the  residents  liv-
ing around Love Field have not been polled. 

Senator ENSIGN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator BURNS. Senator Nelson, do you have any questions? 
Senator BEN NELSON. No, I have no question, thank you. 
Senator BURNS. Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. No, thank you. 
Senator BURNS. We thank you, this morning, for coming. I know

hard  over  there  and  get  us  out  of  here  next  week,  I’d  be  most  ap-
preciative.

ficer and Senior Executive Vice President, Dallas/Fort Worth Inter-
national Airport. 

We  welcome  these  gentlemen  to  the  table  this  morning  and  look 

forward to their testimony. 

Mr. Arpey, we will begin with you. 

STATEMENT OF GERARD ARPEY, CHAIRMAN/CEO, 

AMERICAN AIRLINES 

Mr. ARPEY. OK, thank you, Chairman Burns. I want to thank the 

entire Committee for the opportunity to be here today. 

It is no secret that the airline industry, one of our Nation’s fore-
most economic catalysts, is in a state of financial turmoil, and cer-
tainly  public  policy  influences  our  business  in  more  ways  than  we 
have time to discuss today—from aviation security to infrastructure 
to taxation to pension regulations and much more. 

So,  it  is  with  some  regret,  but  with  great  conviction,  that  I  ap-
pear  before  you  to  speak  not  about  any  of  those  topics,  but  about 
the  manufactured  controversy  swirling  around  Love  Field  and  the 
Wright Amendment. 

I don’t mean to suggest that the issue is not important. It is criti-
cally important. But at American Airlines, we would greatly prefer 
to  limit  our  competition  with  Southwest  Airlines  to  the  market-
place rather than the halls of Congress. 

Southwest  could  make  that  happen  by  simply  following  the  pub-
lic  policy  set  forth  by  the  Federal  Government  and  the  local  com-
munities  that  every  other  airline  follows  without  acrimony.  South-
west  can  launch  service  to  anywhere  it  would  like,  and  charge 
whatever  it  would  like,  from  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  Air-
port,  one  of  the  world’s  largest  and  leading  airports  just  12  miles 
from its headquarters. That opportunity has always been available 
to  them.  And,  at  this  moment,  there  are  plenty  of  gates  at  DFW 
ready for their use. But Southwest refuses to consider DFW’s level 
playing  field,  and  that  refusal  is  what  has  brought  us  here  today. 
On one hand, the debate is a costly distraction at the worst pos-
sible time. It is eating up time, money, and energy we would much 
rather devote to running our business. On the other hand, there is 
a lot at stake, not just for American Airlines, but a number of other 
constituencies who you will be hearing from today. 

So,  I  am  hopeful  that  today’s  proceedings  will  shed  light  on  an 
issue  that,  quite  frankly,  has  been  mischaracterized  by  Southwest. 
Now, I want to make clear that Herb Kelleher is a man I respect 
and  admire  a  great  deal.  He  is  a  charismatic  leader,  an  inno-
vator—— 

[Mr. Kelleher blows kiss at Mr. Arpey.] 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. ARPEY.—a fierce competitor, and an exceptional lawyer. Herb 
has set the standard by which a generation of airline CEOs, includ-
ing  myself,  will  be  measured.  And  that  is  an  extraordinarily  high 
standard. 

But none of that negates the fact that, in my opinion, he and his 
team  are  simply  wrong  on  this  subject.  To  explain,  I  want  to  step 
back and reiterate how we got here. The issue we’re debating goes 
back to the 1960s, when the Federal Government ordered the cities 
of Dallas and Fort Worth to combine resources around a single air-

port  if  they  wanted  to  continue  to  receive  Federal  funding.  The 
leaders  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  concluded,  very  wisely,  that  it 
was in the interest of both cities to cooperate with the Federal Gov-
ernment and combine resources in support of a single regional air-
port. And the results speak for themselves. Today, DFW Airport is 
one  of  the  world’s  premier  aviation  gateways.  It  is  the  undisputed 
driver of the North Texas economy, and, with the recent completion 
of  a  $2.6  billion  capital  project  premised  on  the  basis  that  the 
Wright Amendment would remain in place, it is poised to make an 
even greater contribution in the years to come. 

When  DFW  was  built,  both  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  intended  to 
close  all  other  local  airports,  including  Love  Field,  to  commercial 
airline  service.  Every  airline  serving  those  cities  was  told  they 
would  have  to  move  their  operations  to  the  new  airport.  And,  in 
1970,  every  airline  signed  an  agreement  committing  to  do  so. 
Southwest  had  not  yet  begun  service  when  that  agreement  was 
signed.  Its  service  started  shortly  thereafter,  at  Love  Field.  And 
when DFW opened, in 1974, Southwest exploited the fact that they 
had  not  signed  the  1970  agreement,  and  they  refused  to  leave. 
Their  refusal  led  to  litigation  that  enabled  them  to  stay  at  Love 
Field,  providing  intra-Texas  service  only,  while  every  other  airline 
was forced out, because they had signed those agreements. 

When  Southwest  later  sought  to  fly  outside  of  Texas  from  Love 
Field,  more  legal  wrangling  ensued,  and,  finally,  in  1979,  a  com-
promise  was  reached.  Southwest,  and  others,  supported  Federal 
legislation now famously known as the Wright Amendment that al-
lowed  Love  Field  to  remain  open,  but  limited  service  to  markets 
within Texas and the contiguous states. 

Now,  at  this  point,  I  would  like  to  emphasize  two  important 

things, in particular. 

First, the Wright Amendment’s restrictions do not apply uniquely 
to Southwest, and they never have. They apply to every airline, in-
cluding American. 

And, second, unlike Southwest, American Airlines played no part 
in  creating  the  Wright  Amendment.  At  the  time  the  law  was  en-
acted,  American  was  a  much  smaller  player  at  DFW.  We  had  just 
moved our headquarters to Fort Worth from New York City. To my 
knowledge, we played no role in the law’s creation. But in the years 
since  it  took  effect,  we  have  based  billions  of  dollars  of  investment 
decisions  on  the  presumption  that  a  deal  is  a  deal,  and  that  the 
compromise reached in 1979 would be honored by everyone. 

Now, Southwest tends to depict the Wright Amendment as an al-
batross around its neck, when, in reality, it was a victory for them 
and a defeat for the airlines who had been forced out of Love Field, 
and for the cities that wanted it closed forever. 

In  the  quarter  century  since  the  law  was  passed,  while  dozens 
of carriers have fought it out at DFW, Southwest has chosen to re-
strict  its  Dallas  flying  to  Love  Field.  And  the  question  you  might 
ask is why Southwest, after all these years, and after my colleague 
Herb  Kelleher  has  been  quoted  publicly  as  saying,  ‘‘I  pledged  we 
wouldn’t  seek  to  overturn  it,’’  now  wants  the  law  changed.  There 
are  two  straightforward  answers,  in  my  opinion.  First,  Southwest 
knows  that  approximately  60  percent  of  American’s  DFW  pas-

sengers  live  closer  to  Love  Field  than  to  DFW.  And,  second,  it  has 
a virtual lock on the lion’s share of Love Field’s active gates. 

In  our  opinion,  Southwest  is  after  one  thing:  unique  competitive 
advantage.  They  seek  a  downtown  monopoly  that  would  mean  a 
windfall  for  them  and  certain  damage  to  American  Airlines  of 
North Texas and many smaller communities around the country. 

It  is  ironic  that  Southwest’s  PR  campaign  seeks  to  position  it  as 
a champion of free and open competition. The best free-market lab-
oratory  I  know  is  DFW,  where  we  slug  it  out  with  a  long  list  of 
carriers  in  dozens  of  markets  every  day.  In  contrast,  Southwest 
wants to have its cake, in my opinion, and eat it, too. It champions 
the  free  market,  but  will  not  compete  at  DFW.  It  wants  to  lift  re-
strictions  on  what  it  can  do  at  Love  Field,  but  opposes  changes  to 
the Love Field local master plan that would let airlines like Amer-
ican challenge its dominance there. 

One of the other great smokescreens of this debate is that it has 
something to do with ticket prices. The members of this committee 
know that airfares have dropped dramatically in recent years. And 
vigorous  and  fair  competition  is  what  keeps  fares  low.  But,  most 
importantly,  it  is  not  about  fares,  because,  at  DFW,  any  carrier, 
Southwest  included,  that  is  willing  to  compete  on  a  level  playing 
field  can  offer  any  service  and  charge  whatever  price  it  wants  to. 
What  this  debate  is  really  about  is  whether  it’s  in  anybody’s  in-
terest,  besides  Southwest’s,  to  reverse  public  policy,  on  which  bil-
lions  of  dollars  have  been  invested,  and  shrink  DFW  to  grow  Love 
Field.  I  strongly  believe  the  answer  is  no.  No  reasonable  person 
could dispute the fact that if Love Field is allowed to expand, that 
expansion  will  come  at  DFW’s  expense.  Given  Love’s  closer  prox-
imity  to  lots  of  people  in  Dallas  and  Love’s  lower  facility  costs, 
American  and  other  airlines  will  divert  a  significant  number  of 
flights to Love Field, and that will have profound repercussions. 

As  flights  start  to  thin  out,  so  will  the  connecting  opportunities 
they  create.  And  as  the  Members  of  this  Committee  know,  when  a 
community hosts a large hub airline, it inevitably enjoys more non-
stop service to more places, and more international destinations, in 
particular,  than  it  would  otherwise  attract.  That  is  because  of  the 
critical  mass  of  connecting  traffic  that  a  hub  creates.  The  desir-
ability of hosting a large hub, and the obvious efficiency of consoli-
dating  activity  around  one  airport  explains  why  cities  all  over  the 
country have gone to great lengths to ensure that the new airports 
they build are not undermined by the airports they replace. 

In Denver, the runways at the old Stapleton Airport were imme-
diately  destroyed  upon  the  opening  the  city’s  new  airport.  And  it 
seems  relevant  to  point  out  that,  just  last  month,  King  county,  in 
Seattle,  Washington,  told  Southwest,  unequivocally,  that  it  would 
not  be  allowed  to  provide  service  at  the  close-in  Boeing  Field,  as 
it had been lobbying to do. 

People  are  sometimes  surprised  to  learn  that,  on  a  per  capita 
basis,  cities  with  one  large  airport—for  example,  Denver,  Atlanta, 
Minneapolis—attract more flights per day than cities like Chicago, 
Washington,  D.C.,  or  Houston,  with  multiple  airports.  The  key 
point, in my view, is that communities benefit from competition be-
tween airlines, not competition between airports.

The  leaders  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  recognize  this  and  made 
the  logical  decision  to  consolidate  the  region’s  aviation  activities 
around  one  world-class  airport  instead  of  multiple  lesser  facilities. 
And were it not for timing and some stubborn lawyering by South-
west, their commonsense vision would have been realized. 

Southwest’s  campaign  to  repeal  the  Wright  Amendment  at  the 
expense  of  DFW  imperils  the  economic  health  of  the  entire  region. 
DFW  is  the  engine  that  drives  our  local  economy,  attracting  bil-
lions of dollars in economic activity that might otherwise flow else-
where.  The  annual  economic  impact  on  North  Texas’s  economy  is 
estimated  at  $14  billion,  and  nearly  300,000  jobs  are  supported  ei-
ther directly or indirectly by the airport. 

But  North  Texas  is  not  the  only  community  in  jeopardy.  The 
vigor  of  our  DFW  hub,  the  fact  that  we  are  able  to  aggregate  and 
distribute  a  high  volume  of  air  travelers  from  a  central  point, 
makes  it  economically  feasible  for  us  to  provide  service  to  many 
communities  that  would  otherwise  be  considered  too  small.  With 
that in mind, with us today are a number of local officials who are 
eager to speak out on this issue. 

I  have  also  submitted,  for  the  record,  a  recent  study  conducted 
at our request by the highly respected Eclat Consulting Group that 
illustrates  how  service  to  dozens  of  cities  would  be  jeopardized  by 
the repeal of the Wright Amendment. 

The  bottom  line,  from  American’s  perspective,  is  that  repealing 
the Wright Amendment would be both unfair and unwise. It would 
be unfair to the Greater North Texas community, to DFW Airport, 
and to all the airlines who have invested billions of dollars assum-
ing  that  the  rules  of  the  game  Southwest  helped  create,  and  has 
benefited  from  for  many  years,  would  remain  in  place.  It  would 
also  be  unfair  to  many  businesses  and  homeowners  who  have  in-
vested  in  the  neighborhoods  surrounding  Love  Field  and  are  obvi-
ously  concerned  about  the  noise,  traffic,  and  other  environmental 
impacts  that  would  accompany  a  major  expansion  of  that  airport. 
Repealing the Wright Amendment would also be unwise, because 
it would do real damage to DFW Airport, the heart of our regional 
economy,  as  well  as  American  Airlines  and  the  tens  of  thousands 
of  active  and  retired  employees  who  depend  on  us.  It  would  jeop-
ardize  both  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth’s  hard-earned  status  as  centers 
of  international  commerce  and  culture.  And  in  an  era  when  global 
connectivity  is  the  key  to  prosperity,  it  would  badly  degrade  the 
most  important  link  between  many  small  communities  and  the 
world at large. 

I would, thus, urge the Committee to tell Southwest Airlines that 
the sound public policy that led to the creation and success of DFW 
Airport,  and  on  which  billions  of  dollars  of  investment  has  been 
based, will not be undermined for their benefit. They are free to fly 
about the country from DFW anytime they would like. 

Thank you very much.

portunity to testify today on the critical importance of maintaining the Federal law 
commonly referred to as the Wright Amendment. 

For the last 26 years, the Wright Amendment has helped ensure a balance in the 
Dallas/Fort  Worth  aviation  infrastructure.  In  the  late  1960s,  the  leaders  of  Dallas 
and  Fort  Worth,  at  the  urging  of  the  Civil  Aeronautics  Board,  decided  to  join  to-
gether  and  invest  their  resources  in  one  world-class  airport  rather  than  in  two 
small,  competing  facilities.  The  results  speak  for  themselves.  DFW  has  grown  into 
a  major  international  gateway—American  and  American  Eagle  alone  provide  non-
stop  service  to  28  international  destinations—and  the  engine  that  drives  the  re-
gional economy, both as an employer and as a magnet for corporate relocations. 

Our  hub  at  DFW  International  Airport  is  an  important  part  of  our  operation. 
When  DFW  was  built,  both  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  intended  to  close  all  the  other 
local airports to commercial airline service, including Love Field. Every airline serv-
ing  those  cities  was  told  they  would  have  to  move  their  operations  to  the  new  air-
port, and in 1970, every airline signed an agreement committing to do so. 

At that time, Southwest Airlines had not yet begun operating, so it was not asked 
to sign the agreement. To the consternation of virtually everyone involved, when the 
new  DFW  Airport  opened  in  1974,  Southwest—which  had  started  its  Love  Field 
service by that time—refused to move with everyone else. Their refusal led to litiga-
tion enabling them to stay at Love Field—providing intra-Texas service only—while 
American and their other competitors were forced out. 

When  Southwest  later  sought  to  fly  outside  of  Texas  from  Love  Field,  more  legal 
wrangling  ensued,  and  ultimately  a  compromise  was  reached.  Southwest  and  rep-
resentatives of the local communities drafted and agreed to Federal legislation—now 
famously  known  as  the  Wright  Amendment—allowing  Love  Field  to  remain  open, 
but  become  exclusively  a  short-haul  airport  with  service  limited  to  markets  within 
Texas and the four contiguous states. The law’s provisions are not uniquely applied 
to Southwest. They apply to every airline. Meanwhile, any airline, including South-
west, remained free to fly anywhere in the country from the DFW Airport. 

For the past quarter century, as we—and dozens of other carriers—slugged it out 
at  DFW,  Southwest  has  chosen  to  restrict  its  Dallas  flying  to  Love  Field,  where  it 
has been able to exploit its near-monopoly and grow itself into a large and very suc-
cessful airline. 

During  that  time,  DFW  International  airport  has  become  an  engine  for  economic 
growth in the North Texas region. The billions of dollars of community, private, and 
Federal  investment  at  DFW  have  ensured  access  to  worldwide  markets  for  the  re-
gion, access to those same markets for small and medium-sized cities across the Na-
tion, and an outstanding facility where 23 airlines compete today. 

Today,  DFW’s  role  in  the  North  Texas  economy  is  more  important  than  ever.  As 
we have stated publicly many times, airline competition is good, airport competition 
is bad. If Love Field had been a non-constrained infrastructure for the last 31 years, 
the  massive  public  and  private  investment  in  DFW  would  have  been  jeopardized. 
All airlines would have been torn between offering service at a superior, central air-
port, DFW, or flying from the older, smaller airport, Love Field, with the sole advan-
tage—though  an  advantage  that  can  not  be  underestimated—of  a  location  that  is 
12 miles closer to approximately 60 percent of the local population. Many of the car-
riers serving the region would have chosen to offer flights only at Love Field. 

The  decision  to  build  DFW,  and  close  all  the  other  local  airports  to  commercial 
service, was made long before American Airlines had such a major presence in Dal-
las/Fort  Worth.  In  fact,  when  DFW  was  opened,  American  was  only  the  third  or 
fourth  largest  presence  at  the  airport.  The  Wright  Amendment  was  in  no  way  cre-
ated with American Airlines specifically in mind. 

Indeed,  the  battle  over  the  Wright  Amendment  is  less  a  story  of  American  and 
Southwest  and  more  a  story  of  the  importance  of  hubs  to  cities,  large  and  small, 
connected  by  the  U.S.  air  transportation  system  to  domestic  and  international  des-
tinations. 

In early October, ECLAT Consulting Group, a highly-respected independent avia-
tion  firm,  released  a  study  assessing  the  impact  of  potential  repeal  of  the  Wright 
Amendment  on  air  service  in  communities  throughout  Texas  and  the  Nation.  The 
study concluded that repeal would lead to a net loss of 185 daily flights in the DFW 
market, including the loss of some key international flights. 

Although  some  major  cities  may  receive  additional  service  from  Southwest  Air-
lines, a net loss of 185 flights would have a negative economic impact for the North 
Texas  region  and  a  serious  reduction  in  connecting  service  opportunities  for  many 
smaller communities now served by American Airlines and American Eagle through 
the  hub  and  spoke  system.  Communities  specifically  at  risk  include  small  towns  in 
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Missouri.

The  hub  and  spoke  system  allows  airlines  to  collect  and  redistribute  traffic  from 
cities  of  all  sizes.  For  those  cities  that  are  fortunate  enough  to  be  hub  cities,  like 
Dallas/Fort  Worth,  residents  enjoy  access  to  significantly  more  service  than  could 
be supported by the economics of their population alone. It is the connecting traffic 
that  makes  most  international  flights  economically  feasible.  The  desirability  of 
international flights is one reason so many cities with new hub airports go to great 
lengths  to  make  sure  these  facilities  are  not  undermined  by  the  old  airports  they 
replace. This is also what attracts large companies to relocate here. 

Without  the  construction  of  DFW  International  Airport,  the  Nation  would  not 
have  had  a  North  Texas  facility  that  could  support  a  full-fledged  airline  hub.  As  a 
landlocked  metropolis  with  no  other  port  of  entry  for  people  and  goods,  the  region 
could not have grown and prospered as it has for the past 31 years. 

Today, DFW stands as the third largest airport in the world in the number of op-
erations,  serving  39  nonstop  international  destinations  and  135  nonstop  domestic 
destinations.  And  DFW  connects  travelers  from  across  the  country  to  a  network  of 
flights.  If  passengers  lose  their  connection  to  the  network,  they  will  lose  opportuni-
ties for travel. 

If  Southwest  succeeds  in  their  effort  to  get  the  Wright  Amendment  repealed, 
American  could  remain  at  DFW  and  match  fares  to  maintain  its  customer  base  to 
the  west  of  DFW.  However,  almost  60  percent  of  American’s  best  customers  live 
closer to Love Field—customers who would choose the closer airport and the airlines 
that  operate  there.  American  cannot  afford  to  lose  those  customers.  That  is  why 
American and other airlines would seek to start service at Love Field. 

If  the  Wright  Amendment  restrictions  on  Love  Field  are  lifted,  American  and 
other airlines, to serve the needs of their customers and to lower their facility costs, 
will  shift  flights  from  DFW  to  Dallas’s  closer-in  airport.  That’s  bad  news  for  DFW 
and  for  the  North  Texas  community  that  enjoys  the  robust  international  schedule 
that the hub makes possible. 

A network airline hub requires local passengers from surrounding communities as 
well as connecting passengers from spoke cities in order to support its vast number 
of  destinations  and  frequencies.  Because  American  would  have  to  move  flights  to 
Love  to  compete  for  local  passengers,  a  lot  of  local  traffic  would  shift  away  from 
DFW.  With  a  reduction  in  flights,  connecting  opportunities  are  reduced  for  pas-
sengers flying through DFW. This reduction in connecting passengers, coupled with 
the  shift  of  local  traffic  to  Love  Field  will  cause  a  further  decrease  in  frequencies 
or loss of service altogether for some communities. 

DFW  Airport  has  repeatedly  offered  Southwest  Airlines  incentives  to  move  to 
DFW, where they could fly to any destination they choose and charge whatever they 
like.  In  fact,  there  are  over  20  gates  just  waiting  to  be  used,  and  Southwest  could 
be in place and competing—in dozens of markets—very quickly if it chose to. 

However,  by  refusing  to  consider  DFW,  Southwest  is  trying  to  have  its  cake  and 
eat it too. It is lobbying to remove restrictions on its own flying, while opposing any 
change  to  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan  that  limits  the  number  of  allowed  gates  and 
daily flights. With Southwest controlling 21 out of 26 reasonably usable gates—and 
by  setting  a  32-gate  maximum—such  restrictions  deny  American  or  any  other  air-
line  a  chance  to  establish  a  meaningful  presence  at  that  airport.  Southwest  is  well 
aware of this outcome. 

I  want  to  make  it  very  clear  that  despite  our  adversarial  roles,  I  am  a  great  ad-
mirer  of  Herb  Kelleher  and  the  entire  Southwest  team.  But  on  this  issue  they  are 
simply  wrong.  The  fact  is,  Southwest  has  always  had  the  opportunity  to  fly  any-
where it wants, charge whatever it wants, and compete—along with everyone else— 
at DFW, a world class airport just 8 miles, as the crow flies, from its headquarters. 
That  opportunity  is  still  available  to  them.  But  rather  than  take  advantage  of  this 
community’s  enormous  investment  in  DFW,  they  want  to  change  the  rules  of  the 
game, again, to their advantage. 

In  fact,  to  prove  to  you  how  much  Herb  and  I  agree,  I  would  like  to  read  to  you 

a statement he made in 1990: 

‘‘We  think  that  there  is  some  merit  to  the  position  that  there  is  no  city  in  the 
United  States  that  has  two  full-fledged  hubs  competing  against  one  another 
successfully . . . we  too  have  to  agree  as  a  matter  of  logic  and  principle  that 
if you allowed Love Field to come up as a full-fledged hub in opposition to DFW 
Airport that indeed air service to the Metroplex would suffer to some extent be-
cause basically a hub-and-spoke system depends for its success upon attracting 
passengers from a multitude of spokes that will fill up an airplane going to an-
other  destination.  If  you  divide  that  type  of  operation  between  two  airports, 
you’re likely to lose service to some of the smaller cities.’’

them. 

Herb  Kelleher’s  words  are  as  compelling  today  as  they  were  the  day  he  made 

From  a  Federal  viewpoint,  it  is  important  to  ask  why  we  would  choose  to  spend 
even  more  Federal  money—scarce  tax  dollars—to  duplicate  TSA  security  services, 
FAA  and  air  traffic  control  services,  and  airport  improvement  monies  at  a  near-ob-
solete  airport  that  is  simply  redundant.  DFW  International  Airport  has  facilities 
available for all, the capacity to continue growing for decades, and a location in the 
region that is accessible for all. 

In  closing,  let  me  say  again:  competition  between  airlines  is  a  perfect  reflection 
of  a  free  market,  but  competition  between  airports—public  infrastructure—is  bad. 
It  reduces  the  strength  of  the  aviation  system  in  a  local  region.  The  only  airline 
pushing for this change in law, Southwest, has consciously chosen to operate at the 
constrained  airport  for  31  years  in  order  to  partake  of  its  inherent  advantages. 
Southwest could actually compete in any market from North Texas by simply choos-
ing  to  fly  out  of  DFW.  Instead,  it  seeks  an  act  of  Congress  to  legislate  a  further 
advantage  at  Love  Field,  rather  than  compete  head-to-head  with  23  airlines  at 
DFW. 

Thank you for allowing me to testify before you today. We look forward to working 
with Members of this Committee to ensure that the Wright Amendment remains in 
place  so  that  all  airlines  may  effectively  compete  to  benefit  customers  across  the 
country—and the world. 

Senator BURNS. Thank you. 
And  now  we  have  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Southwest  Air-

lines, Mr. Herb Kelleher. Thank you for coming. 

STATEMENT OF HERBERT D. KELLEHER, 

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES 

Mr.  KELLEHER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished 

members of—— 

Senator BURNS. Pull your microphone over there so—— 
Mr.  KELLEHER.  Oh,  I’m  sorry,  I  thought  it  was—yes,  I  thought 

my voice was loud enough without the microphone. 

Senator BURNS. Well, it is—— 
Mr. KELLEHER.—Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  BURNS.—but  this  fellow  right  over  here  is  writing  down 

everything that you say, because—— 

Mr. KELLEHER. OK. 
Senator BURNS.—we hang on every word. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.  Well,  I’m  going  to  try  to  confine  my  remarks  to 
5  minutes,  as  we  were  told  that  we  should.  But  if  I  stray  a  little 
bit over, I hope you’ll forgive me, because I’m sandwiched between 
Mr.  Arpey  and  Mr.  Cox,  who  are  both  adversaries  on  this  issue, 
and, evidently, from Mr. Arpey’s presentation, he wasn’t told about 
the 5-minute rule. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. KELLEHER. Second, I want to tell you that I have the highest 
regard for Mr. Arpey and American Airlines and all the people that 
work at American. And this is not political persiflage that I’m just 
delivering  today  because  we’re  sitting  here  together.  He  has  done 
a fabulous job at American. He cares for the American Airlines peo-
ple.  And  they  haven’t  gone 
into  Chapter  11.  They’ve  got 
$3,900,000,000 in cash in the bank. And that’s a tribute to his lead-
ership in the worst of times and, I think, a stellar comparison com-
pared to a lot of other carriers. 

I really am appreciative of the opportunity to be with you today. 
I  started  working  on  the  birth  of  Southwest  Airlines  39  years 
ago, when only about 15 percent of American adults had ever flown

on  even  a  single  commercial  airline  flight.  Today,  that  percentage 
is  around  85  percent.  According  to  DOT,  the  ‘‘Southwest  Effect’’— 
and  DOT  labeled  it  that—played  a  crucial  role  in  increasing  that 
15  percent  to  85  percent,  so  that  a  lot  more  Americans  had  the 
freedom to fly every year. 

Because the CAB of the 1960s did not welcome price competition 
against  its  carriers,  Southwest  applied  to  fly  as  an  intrastate  air-
line.  Southwest’s  proposal  was  very  simple:  charge  much  lower 
fares and provide a better quality of air service than the incumbent 
CAB carriers. 

From the reaction, you might have thought that we had proposed 
to  unleash  the  Four  Horsemen  of  the  Apocalypse.  The  incumbents 
threatened  to  withdraw  service  from  every  city  we  proposed  to 
serve. Sound familiar? Contended that low fares would not produce 
any  additional  passengers.  Sound  familiar?  Hired  every  politically 
connected  lawyer  and  lobbyist  in  the  State  of  Texas  to  oppose  us. 
Sound  familiar?  And  took  us  on  a  4-year  journey  through  the 
courts before we could fly our first flight. 

Southwest  commenced  operations  in  Texas  in  1971.  What  hap-
pened?  Not  one  airline  withdrew  service  from  any  city  that  we 
served.  The  Four  Horsemen  of  the  Apocalypse  did  not  ride,  but  a 
huge multitude of additional passengers did, every year. 

In  1972,  within  a  year  of  our  commencement  of  service,  South-
west  was  sued  to  oust  us  from  Dallas  Love  Field,  a  move  that 
would  have  obliterated  Southwest  Airlines.  This  resulted  in  just  5 
more  years  of  litigation—we’re  now  up  to  9—including  two  more 
trips to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals,  and  three  proceedings  before  the  district  court,  which  de-
cided  on  two  Federal-law  grounds,  two  State-law  grounds,  and  the 
violation  of  two  bondholder  covenants,  that  it  was  not  legally  per-
missible to remove Southwest Airlines from Love Field. That’s two 
Federal,  two  State,  two  bond  covenants.  And  the  Fifth  Circuit 
Court  of  Appeals  admonished,  ‘‘This  is  the  eighth  time  in  3  years 
that  a  Federal  court  has  refused  to  support  the  eviction  of  South-
west  Airlines  from  Love  Field.’’  The  eighth  time  in  3  years.  What 
next? 

In 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act became law. The CAB, the 
Civil  Aeronautics  Board,  authorized  Southwest  to  provide  inter-
state air service from Love Field. Then fate intervened. The Honor-
able  Jim  Wright  was  the  Majority  Leader  of  the  House  of  Rep-
resentatives and represented DFW Airport. Without notice or hear-
ing, he amended a House bill to ban all interstate air service from 
Love  Field.  The  Senate,  this  Senate,  refused  to  concur.  A  political 
donnybrook ensued. Senator Barry Goldwater commented, ‘‘I think 
we’re acting like a bunch of yo-yo’s. Why can’t people just fly to the 
airport they want to fly to?’’ 

Finally,  I  was  informed  that  the  conference  committee  had 
agreed  on  a  compromise:  nonstop  interstate  air  service  could  be 
provided  out  of  Love  Field  to  only  the  four  States  contiguous  to 
Texas.  Moreover,  Southwest  could  not  provide  one-stop  through 
ticketing  nor  market  passenger  service  beyond  those  States.  I  pro-
tested  bitterly  until  reminded  of  a  self-evident  truth  that  Leader 
Wright was the Majority Leader, and I was not.

Thus, airline deregulation passed in 1978, and Love Field was re-
regulated in 1979, when I was 48 and Jimmy Carter was President 
of the United States. 

In the ensuing 26 years, DFW Airport has gotten so big that I’m 

surprised it hasn’t been implicated in a steroid scandal. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  KELLEHER.  18,500  acre  DFW  now  has  166  gates,  compared 
to 32 at 1,300-acre Love Field. DFW is the world’s third-busiest air-
port. The world’s largest air carrier, American Airlines, with about 
850 daily DFW flights, almost eight times more than Southwest at 
Love  Field,  controls  84  percent—yes,  84  percent—of  the  passenger 
traffic  at  DFW  Airport  and  does  not  exactly  welcome  interlopers 
with warm milk and graham crackers when they come there. 

Due  to  its  dominance,  American  charges  high  fares  at  DFW.  Its 
generally  available  one-way  coach  fare  to  St.  Louis  and  Kansas 
City—generally available—is $599. Southwest’s generally available 
coach fare would be $129 to St. Louis and Kansas City. And, since 
1979, the DFW side of the Metroplex has grown enormously, while 
the Love Field side has lagged behind it. 

According  to  a  study,  by  Campbell  Hill,  which  we  commissioned 
and—this  is  really  interesting—a  separate  study  by  DFW  Airport, 
which  it  attempted  to  suppress,  failure  to  repeal  the  Wright 
Amendment  by  this  Congress  will  cause  approximately  3.7  million 
passengers per year not to fly and cost the American economy $4.2 
billion each and every year. That’s DFW’s consultant, that’s South-
west  Airlines’  consultant.  Normally  when  you  have  an  issue  and 
opposing  experts  testify,  they  differ.  In  this  case,  they  agree.  This 
is what the Wright Amendment is costing America. And I ask you, 
What governmental policy could conceivably support such a result? 
I  firmly  believe  that  the  Wright  Amendment  must  be  repealed, 
and repealed now, but a number of very well-intentioned public of-
ficials,  organizations,  and  private  citizens  have  solicited  a  com-
promise  designed  to  phase  out  the  Amendment  over  a  period  of 
time.  As  I  have  previously  stated—and  I’ve  stated  this  publicly— 
if the political leadership comes forward to advance any reasonable 
compromise  proposal,  Southwest  Airlines  will  participate  in  that 
process  in  good  faith.  That  is  my  public  pledge  to  this  Committee. 
Mr.  Chairman,  distinguished  members  of  the  Committee,  thank 
you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  on  behalf  of  competition.  Thank 
you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  on  behalf  of  free  enterprise. 
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  on  behalf  of  consumer 
choice. Thank you for the opportunity to appear on behalf of lower 
airfares for millions of Americans each year. And thank you for the 
opportunity to appear on behalf of the American public’s freedom— 
freedom to fly. 
Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HERBERT D. KELLEHER, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, 

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES 

The History of the Wright Amendment 

The  history  of  the  Wright  Amendment  is  the  history  of  Southwest  Airlines.  It  is 
also  a  history  of  anti-competitive  legal  harassment  by  an  airport  and  the  airlines 
that serve it.

37 

Southwest  was  incorporated  on  March  15,  1967.  On  November  27,  1967,  South-
west  filed  an  application  with  the  Texas  Aeronautics  Commission  (TAC)  to  operate 
as  a  Texas  intrastate  carrier.  Southwest  elected  to  operate  as  an  intrastate  carrier 
because  the  U.S.  Civil  Aeronautics  Board  (CAB)  of  that  day  did  not  welcome  new 
competition in the airline industry. The CAB mandated fare levels and did not per-
mit  price  competition.  Prior  to  the  Airline  Deregulation  Act  in  1978,  there  was  no 
competition  on  the  basis  of  price  in  the  U.S.  A  consequence  of  that  Federal  policy 
was  that  there  were  no  new  entrants—if  a  new  airline  could  not  compete  against 
giant  entrenched  competitors  on  price,  it  was  impossible  to  establish  a  toehold  in 
a market. 

Southwest  did  not  fly  for  51  months.  Once  the  TAC  unanimously  approved 
Southwest’s  intrastate  application  on  February  20,  1968,  three  airlines  (Braniff, 
Trans  Texas,  and  Continental),  seeking  to  preserve  their  monopoly  routes,  filed  a 
lawsuit  and  obtained  a  restraining  order  against  the  TAC,  prohibiting  it  from 
issuing  the  necessary  certificate  under  state  law.  That  litigation  lasted  until  May 
13,  1970,  when  a  unanimous  Texas  Supreme  Court  ordered  that  Southwest  could 
take  to  the  skies.  Seeking  every  chance  to  bleed  Southwest  to  death  by  litigation 
(Southwest  having  no  revenues  at  the  time),  the  airlines  took  their  pleas  to  the 
United States Supreme Court, which denied the appeal on December 7, 1970. South-
west  Airlines  thus  became  perhaps  the  only  company  in  America  that  went  all  the 
way  to  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  to  obtain  a  business  license  over  the  opposition  of 
its competitors. 

Southwest  began  preparations  for  the  start  of  service  in  earnest,  with  a  planned 
startup  of  June  18,  1971.  Our  airline  adversaries  were  undeterred.  They  filed  com-
plaints  with  the  CAB  and  just  days  before  service  was  to  begin,  they  sneaked  back 
into  a  state  court  and  obtained  another  injunction  stopping  Southwest’s  flights.  In 
an  extraordinary  session  convened  on  June  17,  1971,  the  Texas  Supreme  Court 
again  gave  Southwest  clearance  for  takeoff.  Service  began  the  very  next  day  with 
three airplanes flying to three cities. 

The now proven model of point-to-point, frequent, low-fare service to close-in con-
venient  airports  was  born.  By  then,  the  litigation  (as  was  intended)  had  depleted 
all of Southwest’s financial capital, but not its will to survive. 

Southwest  announced  that  it  would  not  move  to  the  new  DFW  Airport  when  it 
would  open  in  1974.  Southwest  was  not  a  party  to  the  local  agreement  to  build 
DFW.  Other  airlines  serving  the  North  Texas  market  voluntarily  signed  contracts 
to  fly  exclusively  from  the  new  airport.  Southwest  did  not.  Love  Field  was  better 
suited  to  Southwest’s  customer  needs  than  DFW.  Moving  to  DFW  would  have  de-
stroyed  Southwest.  Southwest  again  was  dragged  involuntarily  into  court—federal 
court  this  time—by  DFW  and  the  Cities  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth.  The  purpose  of 
that  litigation  was  to  crush  Southwest  by  evicting  it  from  Love  Field  in  Dallas,  a 
foundation  of  Southwest’s  low  cost,  low  fare  niche.  In  a  definitive  opinion,  the  Fed-
eral  district  court  held  that  the  local  agreements  to  build  DFW  did  not  and  legally 
could  not  prevent  Southwest  Airlines  from  serving  Love  Field.  City  of  Dallas  v. 
Southwest Airlines Co., 371 F. Supp. 1015 (N.D. Tex. 1973). The DFW Parties were 
not  prepared  to  accept  defeat  and  appealed.  On  May  31,  1974,  the  Fifth  Circuit  af-
firmed  the  lower  court’s  decision,  upholding  Southwest’s  unfettered  right  to  serve 
Love  Field.  City  of  Dallas  v.  Southwest  Airlines  Co.,  494  F.2d  773  (5th  Cir.  1974). 
Still refusing to concede, the DFW parties petitioned the Fifth Circuit for rehearing. 
They  lost  that  one  on  June  24,  1974.  They  appealed  further  to  the  U.S.  Supreme 
Court.  They  lost  again.  419  U.S.  1079  (1974).  They  petitioned  the  Supreme  Court 
for rehearing. Again, that was a loser. 420 U.S. 913 (1975). 

In  a  pique  of  discontent,  the  DFW  Parties  then  prevailed  upon  the  Dallas  City 
Council, after a massive lobbying effort, to pass an ordinance making it a crime for 
Southwest to use Love Field. The Federal judiciary made short work out of that one, 
enjoining Dallas from enforcing the ordinance. 

Desperately  searching  for  a  court  that  would  side  with  them,  the  DFW  Parties, 
including  American  and  the  other  airlines  serving  DFW,  started  litigation  anew  in 
a  state  court  (having  gone  scoreless  in  the  Federal  system),  seeking  to  relitigate 
their  bogus  claims  all  over  again.  A  Federal  court  found  that  this  attempt  to  reliti-
gate questions already decided was, in effect, an abuse of process and took the dra-
matic  action  of  enjoining  the  state  court—or  any  other  court—from  proceeding  fur-
ther.  Southwest  Airlines  Co.  v.  Texas  International  Airlines,  Inc.,  396  F.  Supp.  678 
(N.D.  Tex.  1975).  The  DFW  Parties,  per  usual,  appealed  to  the  Fifth  Circuit.  The 
Fifth  Circuit,  in  an  opinion  remarkable  for  its  clarity  and  conclusiveness,  brought 
an  end  to  the  DFW  Parties  legal  harassment  of  Southwest  by  declaring  that  the 
courts  were  now  off  limits  to  anyone  seeking  to  evict  Southwest  Airlines  from  Love 
Field.  Southwest  Airlines  Co.  v.  Texas  International  Airlines,  Inc.,  546  F.2d  84  (5th

Cir.  1977).  The  DFW  Parties  petitioned  for  rehearing.  They  lost.  They  appealed  to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. They lost that, too. 434 U.S. 832 (1977). 
The Significance of the Airline Deregulation Act 

Then  something  dramatic  happened  outside  a  courtroom.  The  U.S.  Congress  de-
regulated the airline industry in 1978. The Congress, observing the gigantic growth 
in passenger traffic in California and Texas, where intrastate price competition was 
allowed, took the government out of the business of choosing which airports airlines 
would serve and at what price. 

To  drive  the  point  home  that  free  markets,  not  governments,  were  to  determine 
where  and  how  and  at  what  price  airlines  would  provide  domestic  air  service,  the 
Congress  expressly  prohibited  State  and  local  governments  from  regulating  the 
‘‘rates, routes, and services’’ of commercial airlines. Section 105 of the Deregulation 
Act. 

With respect to Southwest Airlines, the court-mandated stoppage of the concerted 
and coordinated legal campaign by the DFW Parties in 1977, coupled with the pas-
sage  of  the  Deregulation  Act  in  1978,  meant  two  very  important  things:  (1)  the 
courts  said  that  no  one  (not  even  mighty  DFW  and  its  large  airlines)  could  kick 
Southwest  out  of  Love  Field;  and  (2)  the  Congress  said  that  Southwest  could  fly 
anywhere in the U.S. from Love Field. 

The  DFW  Parties  did  not  just  go  away  mad.  They  decided  to  get  even.  When 
Southwest announced its intention to fly between Dallas and New Orleans pursuant 
to its rights under the Deregulation Act, the DFW Parties, including American Air-
lines, went to Washington to try to coerce the CAB into denying Southwest the right 
to fly in interstate commerce out of Love Field. Again, they relied on the local agree-
ment  that  produced  DFW  Airport.  Maintaining  their  perfect  record,  the  DFW  Par-
ties  lost  before  a  CAB  Administrative  Law  Judge,  who  ruled  against  DFW  and 
American  on  every  single  point  in  an  exhaustive  analysis  on  June  28,  1979.  CAB 
Docket  34582.  That  decision  was  upheld  in  its  entirety  by  the  full  CAB  on  Sep-
tember 28, 1979. 

During this eleven-year period of nonstop litigation, some other interesting things 
occurred.  Most  noteworthy  was  the  indictment  of  two  airline  competitors  by  a  Fed-
eral  criminal  grand  jury  for  their  role  in  the  conspiracy  to  bankrupt  Southwest. 
They both plead nolo contendre. 
Unending Judicial Defeats Lead to a Political Powerplay 

After  losing  every  round,  before  every  agency  and  every  court  that  could  listen 
to their anti-competitive and anti-consumer arguments, Southwest’s sworn enemies, 
led  by  DFW  Airport  and  the  airlines  that  dominated  it,  decided  upon  a  new  ploy. 
If  Southwest  could  not  be  run  out  of  business  legally,  they  would  just  have  to 
change  the  law.  They  sneaked  back  into  Washington  and  obtained  the  support  of 
House  Majority  Leader  Jim  Wright  from  Ft.  Worth.  If  Leader  Wright  had  not  been 
from  Fort  Worth,  or  being  from  Fort  Worth,  had  not  been  the  House  Leader,  the 
Wright  Amendment  would  never  have  come  to  pass.  Leader  Wright  attached  an 
amendment  to  an  unrelated  bill,  without  notice,  without  hearings,  and  without  op-
portunity  for  public  comment  or  informed  debate.  (The  DFW  Parties  finally  discov-
ered a way to win.) That amendment would have banned any airline from engaging 
in  interstate  air  commerce  from  Love  Field.  Wisely,  the  U.S.  Senate  refused  to  go 
along. That obstructed passage of the bill to which Leader Wright had attached his 
language.  Pressure  built  for  passage  of  the  larger  bill,  which  dealt  with  inter-
national  aviation.  Ultimately  Leader  Wright  himself  made  changes  that  the  Senate 
accepted.  That  became  the  law  we  are  here  to  discuss  today,  the  Federal  law  that 
limits service from Love Field to Texas and a few nearby states. The admitted legis-
lative purpose was to protect DFW Airport and the airlines serving it from competi-
tion.  Everyone  ignored  the  ironic  conflict  between  the  Wright  Amendment  on  one 
hand, and years of consistent court or agency decisions and the Airline Deregulation 
Act (passed just one year earlier), on the other hand. Thus, Love Field became, and 
remains,  the  only  airport  in  America  route-restricted  by  an  Act  of  Congress  for  the 
sole purpose of protecting competitors (one airport and several airlines) from the rig-
ors of the marketplace. 
The Wright Amendment Was Designed to Punish Southwest 

Defenders  of  the  Wright  Amendment  claim  that  it  was  a  ‘‘compromise’’  that  even 
‘‘benefited’’ Southwest. The ‘‘benefit’’ to Southwest is that, although the Amendment 
was intended to punish Southwest and cause it severe economic injury, Southwest’s 
employees managed to make the carrier a success despite it—much to the DFW Par-
ties’  chagrin.  The  proof  of  the  DFW  Parties  anti-competitive  intent  may  be  found 
not  only  in  the  well-known  geographical  restrictions  which  limit  where  a  plane  can 
be  flown,  but  in  the  more  obscure  ‘‘marketing  and  through  ticketing’’  restrictions 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

39 

that are less well-understood. These restrictions are a blatant restraint on commer-
cial  free  speech  and  force  Southwest,  unintentionally,  to  deceive  and  confuse  pas-
sengers.  They  are  without  precedent  in  commercial  aviation,  including  during  the 
regulated  era.  Under  the  Wright  Amendment,  Southwest  cannot  ‘‘offer  or  provide 
any  through  service  . . .’’  and  cannot  ‘‘offer  for  sale  transportation  to  or  from  . . . 
any  point  which  is  outside’’  the  so-called  Wright  Amendment  states.  This  means 
that  even  if  a  customer  is  willing  to  make  a  stop  within  the  permitted  states  and 
continue his or her journey on the same plane, or even a different plane, Southwest 
may  not  offer  or  market  such  service.  An  example:  Southwest  flies  from  Dallas  to 
Little Rock and from Little Rock to Baltimore-Washington International (BWI). But 
Southwest  cannot  sell  a  single  through-ticket  to  a  customer  going  from  Dallas  to 
BWI,  who  is  willing  to  make  a  connection  to  another  plane  in  Little  Rock.  Another 
example: Southwest has a plane that goes from Dallas to Albuquerque where it sits 
for 25 minutes before continuing on to Las Vegas. But Southwest cannot sell a tick-
et  to  someone  going  from  Dallas  to  Las  Vegas  with  a  stop  in  Albuquerque.  That 
someone has to get off the airplane in Albuquerque. 

In contrast, Members of Congress are familiar with the perimeter rule that limits 
the distance of nonstop flights from Reagan National. But, a Member may purchase 
a  ticket  to  destinations  beyond  the  nonstop  perimeter  and  take  a  one-stop  flight  on 
the same airplane to these destinations. Interestingly, the perimeter rule at Reagan 
National  originally  was  much  more  restricted.  It  was  expanded  as  the  result  of  ag-
gressive  lobbying  by  DFW  and  American  Airlines  (with  an  assist  from  Leader 
Wright) to permit American to fly to DFW from Reagan National. The DFW Parties 
views on airport restrictions are quite selective. 

The  marketing  and  through  ticketing  restrictions  are,  in  and  of  themselves,  an 
unreasonable restraint of trade and were totally unnecessary to protect DFW in its 
alleged ‘‘infancy.’’ They were put in not just to protect DFW or the DFW air carriers, 
but  to  make  it  economically  impossible  for  Southwest  to  survive  at  Love  Field.  The 
fact that Southwest Airlines managed to survive in spite of the restrictions does not 
validate  them.  Southwest  fought  against  the  Wright  Amendment  in  all  its  forms, 
including  the  final  version.  No  ‘‘compromise’’  would  have  ever  been  accepted  volun-
tarily which included such goofy and onerous burdens on flight operations and cus-
tomer  service.  The  Wright  Amendment  came  to  pass  because  the  DFW  Parties  and 
Leader  Jim  Wright  had  the  power  to  pass  it  and  Southwest  was  powerless  to  stop 
it. 
Effects of the Wright Amendment 

The  Wright  Amendment,  by  design,  restricts  competition.  This  restraint  of  trade 
has  the  unavoidable  consequence  of  higher  airfares  and  its  corollary,  reduced  de-
mand (fewer passengers). The Wright Amendment consumer penalty has been quan-
tified.  In  a  study  commissioned  by  Southwest  and  conducted  by  the  Campbell-Hill 
Aviation Group, the benefits of repealing the Wright Amendment include: 

Field and DFW. 

• 3.7  million  more  passengers  would  travel,  increasing  passengers  at  both  Love 
• Consumers  would  save  nearly  $700  million  annually  compared  to  the  higher 
airfares  extracted  from  consumers  by  American  Airlines  at  DFW  as  a  result  of 
its market power and the absence of competition. 
• The  total  negative  economic  impact  of  the  Wright  Amendment  on  the  entire 

United States exceeds $4 billion each and every year. 

These  numbers  were  entirely  corroborated  by  a  study  commissioned  by  DFW 
International  Airport.  Initially,  that  part  of  the  DFW  study  was  suppressed  by 
DFW. Only after a newspaper made a freedom of information demand did the truth 
surface. 
People Understand and Hate the Wright Amendment 

As  a  result  of  the  seismic  shift  in  travel  habits  brought  about  by  deregulation, 
today’s consumers have an expectation of air service options at affordable prices. Be-
fore  deregulation,  only  the  wealthy  flew  on  commercial  airlines.  Today,  air  travel 
is accessible to virtually all Americans. Like their fellow citizens across the country, 
Texans have become savvy air travel consumers. They hate the Wright Amendment. 
One  reason  is  that  because  of  the  Wright  Amendment,  American  Airlines  has  49 
nonstop  total  monopoly  markets  from  DFW  on  which  American  carries  6.5  million 
annual passengers. American’s average fares, according to the Campbell-Hill study, 
are  sharply  higher  in  those  markets  than  in  competitive  markets.  For  example, 
based on 2004 full year data, American’s average (not its highest) roundtrip fare be-
tween DFW and Omaha (a distance of 583 miles) was $464. American’s average fare 
between DFW and Albuquerque (a distance of 569 miles) was just $220, or less than

half of its average fare to Omaha. Why? The answer is plain and simple. Southwest 
can  and  does  fly  between  Dallas  Love  Field  and  Albuquerque,  New  Mexico.  South-
west cannot fly from Dallas Love Field to Omaha. Similar examples abound. 

A just released scientific poll done by Public Opinion Strategies of Arlington, Vir-
ginia, found that North Texans favored repeal of the Wright Amendment by the as-
tounding  margin  of  82  percent  to  13  percent.  When  asked  whether  they  supported 
the  closure  of  Love  Field,  as  DFW  and  American  seek,  North  Texans  were  even 
more  opinionated,  opposing  such  a  move  by  a  margin  of  84  percent  to  10  percent, 
with  70  percent  STRONGLY  opposing  the  closure  of  Love  Field.  Southwest  had 
nothing to do with that poll. 

The poll numbers are lopsided because the facts are lopsided. Consumers are sen-
sitive  to  the  fact  that  they  pay  more  and  have  fewer  options  for  air  travel  due  to 
the  Wright  Amendment.  They  don’t  like  it.  They  also  know  that  DFW  is  the  only 
protected  airport  in  the  country  and  that  they  can  fly  from  any  other  airport  as-
sured that the fares are competitive. Consumers rightfully resent being held hostage 
by  protectionist  rules  that  benefit  a  special  interest  but  are  not  in  the  public  inter-
est. 

Few people outside Texas or Washington, D.C. know what the Wright Amendment 
is.  As  they  learn,  resentment  toward  it  grows.  Attached  is  Exhibit  ‘‘A,’’  which  is  a 
list  of  the  newspapers  and  other  community  organizations  supporting  repeal  of  the 
Wright Amendment. 
Why Change the Wright Amendment Now? 

Southwest  seeks  to  repeal  the  26-year  old  law.  Circumstances  have  changed  dra-

matically since 1979. 

• DFW  is  the  second  biggest  airport  in  the  world  in  terms  of  land  area  and  the 
third  busiest  in  terms  of  flight  operations.  It  is  no  longer  an  infant  in  need  of 
pampering. 

• Love  Field  cannot  be  a  significant  threat  to  DFW.  A  Love  Field  Master  Plan 
was  established  in  2001,  and  approved  by  the  FAA,  which  caps  flights  through 
limiting the airport to 32 gates—one-fifth the size of DFW. 

• Consumers across America are upset by the high cost of travel to and from the 
Dallas/Ft.  Worth  region  and  recognize  that  competition  will  cause  prices  to 
drop. 

• Passenger  traffic  at  Love  Field,  limited  by  the  Wright  Amendment  to  short 
flights,  declined  after  9/11  by  approximately  24  percent,  as  the  automobile  re-
emerged  as  a  serious  competitor  to  the  airplane.  Accordingly,  flights  have  been 
curtailed. Southwest has only 110 daily departures from Love Field, down from 
a pre-9/11 peak of 145—likewise a 24 percent reduction. 

Why not serve DFW? 

After much thought, Southwest has decided service at DFW is way too risky. 
• Operating  at  DFW  would  split  our  service  between  two  airports  in  the  same 

market and break up our low cost efficient business model. 

• The  out-of-pocket  cost  per  passenger  of  serving  DFW  is  substantially  higher 

than the cost of serving Love Field. 

• The  indirect  cost  of  serving  DFW,  a  complex  facility  designed  for  hub  oper-
ations, would be enormous. Operational inefficiencies would preclude a low cost 
operation,  even  if  airport  rates  and  charges  were  reasonable.  As  attractive  as 
DFW  may  be  for  a  large  international  hub  operation,  DFW,  with  its  very  long 
taxiing  times,  simply  does  not  work  for  a  low  cost  point-to-point  carrier  like 
Southwest. (Apparently, based on its singular lack of success in filling gates left 
vacant  by  Delta,  DFW  does  not  work  for  any  airline—low  cost,  point-to-point, 
or  otherwise—because  of  its  crushing  dominance  by  American  Airlines,  which 
now has 84 percent of the market.) 

• Love  Field  has  idle  capacity  and  the  ability  to  generate  a  better  return  on  in-

vestment than DFW for Southwest. 

• Southwest  has  avoided  forbidding  fortress  hubs  like  DFW,  preferring  smaller, 
less  congested  airports  when  available.  This  strategy  has  helped  make  South-
west America’s only consistently profitable and totally job secure airline. 

• Southwest  Airlines  has  been  headquartered  in  Dallas  for  34  years,  employing 
more  than  5,500  Dallasites,  and  has  become  the  city’s  fifth  largest  taxpayer. 
Moving to DFW would take Southwest out of Dallas, both as a corporate citizen 
and as a taxpayer, causing serious economic harm to our hometown.

Conclusion 

Southwest  has  not  asked  for  bankruptcy  protection,  relief  from  pension  obliga-
tions,  subsidies,  or  Federal  loan  guarantees.  We  have  not  asked  our  employees  for 
wage cuts or slashed their benefits. We have never had an involuntary furlough. We 
have  shared  profits  with  our  employees  for  32  consecutive  years.  We  have  proven 
time  and  again  that  if  competition  flourishes,  prices  decline  while  consumers  and 
communities profit. Southwest is a creature of the free market and of deregulation— 
the  national  policy  with  respect  to  commercial  aviation.  All  we  ask  now  is  for  the 
U.S.  Congress  to  restore  to  Southwest  and  its  customers  what  it  gave  the  rest  of 
the  flying  public  in  1978—a  competitive  free  airline  market—but  which  it  improvi-
dently allowed to be taken away in 1979. The DFW Parties, insisting on special pro-
tection for themselves, lost again and again during more than a decade of litigation 
harassment.  But,  they  succeeded  in  getting  a  legislative  reversal  of  that  unbroken 
string  of  judicial  and  administrative  defeats  through  the  exercise  of  raw  political 
power.  That  exercise  of  power  produces  an  annual  economic  penalty  on  this  Nation 
of  over  $4  billion  and  wrongly  punishes  Southwest  Airlines  for  being  the  success 
that deregulation envisioned. 

Wright is Wrong. It is time to repeal it. If not now, when?

STATEMENT OF KEVIN COX, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER/ 

SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

DALLAS/FORT WORTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 

Mr.  COX.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Com-
mittee.  On  behalf  of  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  Airport 
Board, I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify. 

This debate should not turn upon what is convenient for one car-
rier. This debate cannot be reduced to sound bites or simplistic ar-
guments. This is a real, very serious public-policy issue. 

And despite the testimony to the contrary, this debate really has 
nothing  to  do  with  the  freedom  to  fly  or  about  a  law  that  is  being 
portrayed  as  anti-competitive.  The  fact  is  that  there  is  a  competi-
tive,  level  playing  field  today,  called  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Inter-
national  Airport,  where  six  low-cost  carriers  compete  side  by  side 
with  legacy  carriers  and  continue  to  provide  wonderful  flight  op-
tions to the traveling public. 

Instead, this debate is about a single carrier that refuses to com-
pete with every other carrier at DFW and blames a piece of legisla-
tion  for  its  refusal  to  initiate  service.  In  short,  Southwest  Airlines 
wants  to  compete,  but  only  on  its  terms.  Today,  Southwest  has  an 
unprecedented  97  percent  seat  share  of  commercial  air  traffic  into 
and  out  of  Love  Field.  There  is  not  another  major  airport  in  the 
United States more dominated by a single carrier than Dallas Love 
Field.  In  essence,  Southwest  Airlines  is  asking  Congress  to  grant 
it  a  competitive  advantage  at  the  expense  of  all  of  the  other  air-
lines that played by the rules and invested for the last 31 years in 
DFW Airport. 

Good  public  policy  never  has,  nor  never  should  be,  predicated 
upon  what  is  convenient  for  one  carrier  or  its  shareholders.  In-
stead,  I  respectfully  submit  that  this  debate  should  discuss  the 
merits of honoring a compromise that was agreed to by all. 

A  member  of  our  board,  Fort  Worth  Mayor  Mike  Moncrief  re-
spectfully  asks  this  Committee  to  remember  that  it  was  the  Fed-
eral  Government  which  directed  Fort  Worth  and  Dallas,  in  the 
mid-1960s,  to  close  their  airports  and  choose  a  single  airport.  As 
a  result,  Fort  Worth  has  closed  its  airport,  while  Love  Field  re-
mains  open  today.  In  the  words  of  the  Mayor,  ‘‘We  believe  in  a 
handshake, and a deal is a deal.’’ 

The Wright Amendment came in response to efforts to undue the 
original  agreement,  not  for  any  other  reason.  Despite  the  rhetoric 
to the contrary, Southwest Airlines actually lobbied for the passage 
of  the  Wright  Amendment.  It  has  attempted  to  use  it  as  a  foil  to 
prevent  carriers  from  entering  Love  Field,  has  chided  the  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  to  fulfill  the  congressional  intent,  has  sent 
letters  urging  the  city  of  Dallas,  the  city  of  Fort  Worth,  and  the 
Airport Board to honor this compromise, and, in one filing with the 
Federal Government, even suggested that Congress should kick out 
anyone who wants to alter this agreement. 

The debate should also focus on the smaller States and the cities 
that would likely lose service if the Wright Amendment is repealed 
and  the  hub  is  divided,  on  the  impacts  of  the  local  community  of 
reopening  a  facility  that  was  supposed  to  be  closed  to  all  commer-
cial  traffic,  and  on  the  268,000  men  and  women  who  have  their

livelihoods that depend upon an airport that was built for everyone 
to compete fairly and effectively. 

Recognizing  that  Southwest  Airlines—and  people  want  South-
west  to  fly—and  that  DFW  has  21  vacant  and  available  gates, 
DFW has placed an unprecedented offer on the table, valued at $22 
million: free rent for a year. We stand ready to negotiate with Mr. 
Kelleher,  Mr.  Ricks,  or  Mr.  Kelly,  to  make  that  offer  even  better 
if they will simply sit down with us. The fact is that Southwest can 
leave its short-haul traffic at Love Field and initiate long-haul traf-
fic  at  DFW.  This  is  precisely  what  Continental  Airlines  does  today 
in the DFW marketplace. 

But  you  don’t  have  to  believe  me.  You  can  believe  an  expert,  in 
1990,  who  raised  his  hand  and  swore  to  tell  the  truth  in  a  deposi-
tion,  and  was  asked  a  question  of  whether  or  not  he  believed  the 
Wright  Amendment  needed  to  be  repealed.  And  he  unequivocally 
answered  no.  And  when  asked  why,  he  stated  the  following,  and  I 
will quote, ‘‘Well, we think that there is some merit to the position, 
but  there  is  no  city  in  the  United  States  that  has  two  full-fledged 
hubs  competing  against  one  another  successfully.  We,  too,  have  to 
agree,  as  a  matter  of  logic  and  principle,  that  if  you  allowed  Love 
Field  to  come  up  to  a  full-fledged  hub  in  opposition  to  DFW  Air-
port, that, indeed, air service to the Metroplex would suffer to some 
extent,  because,  basically,  a  hub-and-spoke  system  depends,  for  its 
success,  upon  attracting  passengers  from  a  multitude  of  spokes 
that will fill up an airplane going to another destination. If you di-
vide  an  operation  between  airports,  you’re  likely  to  lose  service  to 
some of the smaller cities.’’ 

Sound familiar? That was Mr.—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. It sure does. 
Mr. COX.—Kelleher’s quote. 
Mr. KELLEHER. I’ve got it here, Mr. Chairman. And—— 
Mr. COX. That is a quote—— 
Mr. KELLEHER.—some of my—— 
Mr. COX.—from Mr. Kelleher. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—opponents  are  taking  considerably  more  time 
than  I  am.  I  would  like  to  bring  that  deposition  before  the  Com-
mittee, if I might, when Mr. Cox is finished. 

Senator BURNS. Finish up. 
Mr. COX. May I finish, sir? Thank you. 
The expert was none other than Mr. Kelleher. 
In closing, sir, on behalf of DFW Airport and the leaders who had 
the  vision  and  the  tenacity  to  design  and  build  this  great  facility, 
and  on  the  men  and  women  who  have  the  honor  and  privilege  of 
operating  this  engine  today,  I  want  to  respectfully  urge  you  to  re-
buff  any  efforts  to  repeal  the  Wright  Amendment.  There  is  simply 
too much at stake. 

I would ask that my full statement be submitted. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Cox follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KEVIN COX, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER/SENIOR EXECUTIVE 

VICE PRESIDENT, DALLAS/FORT WORTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 

On  behalf  of  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  Airport  Board,  I  want  to  thank 
you for the opportunity to testify today on the recent efforts associated with repeal-
ing Section 29 of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, now

more  commonly  known  as  the  ‘‘Love  Field  Amendment’’  or  the  ‘‘Wright  Amend-
ment.’’ 

45 

Over  the  last  year,  this  issue  has  garnered  a  significant  amount  of  local  media 
coverage.  Southwest  Airlines’  campaign  has  taken  the  form  of  television  ads,  bill-
boards, and busses proclaiming ‘‘Wright is Wrong,’’ and has also included Southwest 
Airlines’  flight  attendants  clad  in  vintage  hot  pants  soliciting  signatures  on  a  peti-
tion. As compelling as this media blitz may be to some, there are very serious public 
policy  issues  at  stake,  with  very  serious  and  real  consequences  hanging  in  the  bal-
ance. This debate cannot and should not be reduced to sound bites, slogans, or sim-
plistic arguments. 

Despite the rhetoric to the contrary, this debate really has nothing to do with ‘‘the 
freedom  to  fly  about  the  country’’  or  about  a  law  that  is  being  portrayed  as  ‘‘anti-
competitive.’’ The fact is that a competitive, level playing field exists today in North 
Texas where low fare carriers compete side-by-side with legacy carriers—it is called 
DFW International Airport. At its essence, this is about a single carrier that refuses 
to  compete  with  every  other  carrier  at  DFW  Airport  and  wrongfully  blames  a  piece 
of  legislation  on  its  refusal  to  provide  service.  In  short,  Southwest  Airlines  wants 
to  compete  on  its  terms  and  only  on  its  terms  and  is  asking  Congress  to  intervene 
on  its  behalf.  Good  public  policy  has  never  and  should  never  be  predicated  upon 
what is good for one company or its shareholders. 

I  respectfully  submit  that  this  debate  should,  instead,  discuss  the  merits  of  hon-
oring a compromise that was agreed to by all interested parties. The debate should 
be  focused  upon  the  public  policy  decision  supported  by  the  Federal  Government 
which was acted and relied upon by the local authorities. The debate should assess 
the impacts of re-opening a facility that was destined to be closed to all commercial 
air  traffic.  The  debate  should  consider  the  268,500  men  and  women  whose  liveli-
hoods  depend  upon  an  airport  that  was  designed  and  built  to  permit  all  carriers  to 
compete  on  a  level  playing  field.  This  debate  should  assess  the  harmful  effects  to 
the residents and businesses around Love Field that have relied upon this delicately 
crafted compromise. And finally, this debate should recognize the severe and unnec-
essary consequences to the entire North Texas economy if this agreement is broken. 
I  respectfully  urge  this  Committee  not  to  fall  prey  to  the  pithy  sound  bites,  sim-
plistic  arguments,  or  cute  slogans.  Instead  of  asking  whether  Congress  should  re-
peal the Wright Amendment, I respectfully submit that there are more appropriate 
questions that should be considered. Why, for example, does the Wright Amendment 
need to be repealed at all? Is the Wright Amendment what is really holding service 
back  or  is  it  a  decision  on  the  part  of  one  company  that  chooses  not  to  compete? 
Why has Southwest Airlines abandoned its 25-year stance of ‘‘passionate neutrality’’ 
at  this  particular  time?  And  what  are  the  true  motives  behind  this  repeal  effort? 
I respectfully submit to you that it is, at minimum, suspect when the only profitable 
airline  in  the  industry,  the  airline  with  one  of  the  largest  cash  reserves,  and  the 
airline  that  carries  more  domestic  passengers  than  any  other  carrier  feels  it  nec-
essary to ask Congress to intervene on its behalf so that it can ‘‘compete’’ in its own 
hometown, at an airport that it monopolizes. 
Historical Rivalry for Commercial Air Service 

To understand the genesis, complexities, and nuances of the Wright Amendment, 
it  requires  an  understanding  of  how  and  why  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  Air-
port was created. For many years, the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth were engaged 
in an intense and counterproductive rivalry for the business of commercial aviation 
and  commercial  air  carriers.  While  the  City  of  Dallas  was  enlarging  and  improving 
Love Field, the City of Fort Worth constructed Greater Southwest International Air-
port  (GSIA).  Love  Field  and  GSIA  were  a  mere  twelve  miles  apart.  As  recounted 
in 1973 by Chief Justice William M. Taylor of the U.S. District Court for the North-
ern  District  of  Texas,  ‘‘serving  two  airports  which  were  so  close  together  resulted 
in unnecessary expense to the carriers as well as the taxpayers and inadequate and 
incomplete air service to both cities.’’ 

Recognizing  this  inefficiency,  the  Federal  Government’s  Civil  Aeronautics  Board 
(CAB) instituted in August 1962, an investigation known as the Dallas/Fort Worth, 
Texas  Regional  Airport  Investigation—docket  number  13959.  This  investigation  fo-
cused on the sole issue of whether the Certificate of Public Convenience and Neces-
sity  of  interstate  airlines  under  the  CAB’s  jurisdiction  should  be  amended  so  as  to 
designate a specific airport as a single point through which all interstate air carrier 
service  to  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  must  be  provided.  After  numerous  hearings,  the 
CAB  in  1964  entered  an  interim  order  giving  the  two  cities  a  period  of  180  days 
in which to arrive at a voluntary agreement to designate the single airport through 
which the CAB regulated carriers would service the Dallas/Fort Worth area. In this 
order,  the  CAB  went  on  to  indicate  that  if  the  parties  were  unable  to  agree  on  a

single  airport  to  serve  the  area,  then  the  CAB  would  have  no  choice  but  to  make 
the determination for the two cities. 
DFW Airport’s Founding Documents 

Given  this  impending  designation,  the  Cities  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  agreed  to 
set  aside  their  differences  and  united  to  design,  finance,  and  construct  a  new  re-
gional  airport.  This  airport  was  to  be  located  mid-way  between  the  Cities  of  Dallas 
and Fort Worth. After years of work, the City of Dallas and the City of Fort Worth 
finally entered into a Contract and Agreement on April 15, 1968, defining the power 
and  duties  of  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Regional  Airport  Board,  creating  the  joint  air-
port  fund  of  the  cities,  and  providing  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Dal-
las/Fort Worth Regional Airport. 

On  November  2,  1968,  the  City  of  Dallas  and  the  City  of  Fort  Worth  adopted  by 
agreement  the  1968  Regional  Airport  Concurrent  Bond  Ordinance.  This  bond  ordi-
nance  served  then,  as  it  does  today,  as  the  vehicle  upon  which  all  revenue  bonds 
are issued. Section 9.5(A) of the bond ordinance provides, in pertinent part, that the 
Cities of Dallas and Fort Worth ‘‘hereby covenant and agree that from and after the 
effective  date  of  this  Ordinance,  shall  take  such  steps  as  may  be  necessary,  appro-
priate  and  legally  permissible  . . .  to  provide  for  the  orderly,  efficient  and  effective 
phase-out at Love Field, Red Bird, GSIA and Meacham Field, of any and all Certifi-
cated  Air  Carrier  Services,  and  to  transfer  such  activity  to  the  Regional  Airport  ef-
fective upon the beginning of operations at the Regional Airport.’’ 

Section 9.5(B) goes on to provide, in pertinent part, that the Owner Cities further 
agree  that  they  will  ‘‘promote  the  optimum  development  of  the  lands  and  Facilities 
comprising  the  Regional  Airport  . . .’’  and  ‘‘. . .  neither  the  Cities  nor  the  Board 
will  undertake  with  regard  to  the  Regional  Airport,  Love  Field,  GSIA,  Meacham 
Field  or  Red  Bird,  any  action,  implement  any  policy,  or  enter  into  any  agreement 
or  contract  which  by  its  or  their  nature  would  be  competitive  with  or  in  opposition 
to  the  optimum  development  of  the  Regional  Airport.’’  Finally,  section  9.5(B)  pro-
vides  that  ‘‘. . .  none  of  the  airports  of  the  Cities  shall  be  put  to  or  developed  for 
any  use  which  by  the  nature  thereof  the  optimum  use  and  development  of  the  Re-
gional Airport, including its air and land space, at the earliest practicable date will 
be impaired, diminished, reduced or destroyed.’’ 

With  the  creation  of  the  Regional  Airport  Board  and  a  long-term  funding  mecha-
nism  in  place,  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Regional  Airport  Board  entered  into  a  Use 
Agreement on January 1, 1974, with those commercial air carriers serving the Dal-
las/Fort  Worth  region.  Every  carrier  serving  the  North  Texas  region  executed  the 
Use  Agreement  except  for  Southwest  Airlines,  which  was  at  the  time  an  intrastate 
carrier  only,  regulated  by  the  Texas  Aeronautics  Commission.  In  addition  to  defin-
ing  the  duties  and  obligations  of  both  the  Airport  Board  and  the  signatory  airlines 
in  the  operation  of  the  airport,  the  signatory  airlines  agreed  under  the  Use  Agree-
ment  that  they  would  ‘‘conduct  [their]  Certificated  Air  Carrier  Services  serving  the 
Dallas/Fort  Worth  area  to,  from,  and  at  the  [DFW]  Airport,  to  the  extent  required 
by the terms of the 1968 Regional Airport Concurrent Bond Ordinance.’’ In layman’s 
terms,  the  signatory  carriers  were  contractually  prohibited,  at  the  time,  from  oper-
ating out of any other airport in North Texas, except DFW Airport. 
Southwest  Wins  Right  to  Remain  at  Love  Field  for  Purely  ‘‘Intrastate’’ 

Service 

Consistent  with  both  the  Bond  Covenants  and  the  Use  Agreement,  the  City  of 
Dallas and the City of Fort Worth proceeded to provide for the phase-out of all Cer-
tificated  Air  Carrier  Services  at  their  respective  designated  airports.  Despite  these 
efforts,  including  a  series  of  lawsuits,  Southwest  Airlines  eventually  won  the  right 
to  operate  intrastate  service  out  of  Love  Field  because,  the  Court  concluded,  that 
purely ‘‘intrastate service’’ did not fall within the definition of ‘‘Certificated Air Car-
rier Services’’ under the Use Agreement and the Bond Ordinance. 

In  keeping  with  this  ruling,  only  intrastate  service  was  permitted  into  and  out 
of  Dallas  Love  Field  from  1973  to  1978.  Then  in  1978,  the  U.S.  Congress  changed 
the regulatory scheme of civil aviation when it enacted the Airline Deregulation Act. 
Prior  to  the  complete  elimination  of  these  regulatory  controls,  and  over  the  objec-
tions  of  the  City  of  Dallas,  the  City  of  Fort  Worth,  the  Dallas  Chamber  of  Com-
merce,  the  Fort  Worth  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  North  Texas  Commission,  and 
DFW Airport, Southwest Airlines sought and received a certificate of authority from 
the  Civil  Aeronautics  Board  to  provide  nonstop  ‘‘interstate’’  service  effective  Sep-
tember 1979 from Dallas Love Field to New Orleans. This authority came as a part 
of Southwest Airlines’ Automatic Market Entry Investigation (CAB order 79–9–192), 
wherein  the  CAB  concluded  that  it  had  no  discretion  to  deny  Southwest  Airlines’ 
request.

Congressional Compromise is Reached 

47 

Recognizing that such a route would undermine the 1968 Agreement and the 1968 
bond covenants, the Cities of Dallas and Fort Worth determined that the public in-
terest  in  aviation  safety  was  best  served  by  requiring  all  regularly  scheduled  inter-
state  commercial  flights,  except  air  taxi  flights,  to  serve  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Re-
gional Airport. This is embodied in the Dallas City Council resolution dated Novem-
ber  7,  1979,  wherein  the  City  of  Dallas  expressed  ‘‘its  support  for  Federal  Legisla-
tion  which  would  make  it  clear  that  the  City  of  Dallas  and  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth 
Regional  Airport  Board  have  authority  to  provide  that  all  regularly  scheduled  com-
mercial flights in interstate commerce shall be conducted into and from Dallas/Fort 
Worth  Regional  Airport,  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  the  City  and  the  Board.’’ 
Similarly,  the  City  of  Fort  Worth  expressed  strong  support  for  Federal  legislation 
‘‘which  encourages  the  provision  of  regularly  scheduled  interstate  air  service 
through  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Airport  to  the  exclusion  of  other  airports  in  the  re-
gion,’’ in a resolution adopted November 1, 1979. 

In  light  of  Southwest’s  intent  to  begin  operation  of  interstate  service  from  Love 
Field and in light of the City of Dallas and the City of Fort Worth’s request for Fed-
eral  legislation  that  would  clarify  where  all  interstate  commercial  flights  to  and 
from the North Texas area should be conducted, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed  legislation  which  would  have  prohibited  a  common  carrier  from  operating 
any  regularly  scheduled  interstate  commercial  passenger  flights  into  or  from  any 
other  airport  within  a  20  mile  radius  from  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Regional  Airport. 
Thus,  the  effect  was  to  make  DFW  Airport  the  only  permissible  airport  for  inter-
state traffic in the DFW area as originally contemplated by the Federal Government 
and  as  intended  by  the  City  of  Dallas  and  the  City  of  Fort  Worth  when  they  origi-
nally  agreed  to  build,  construct  and  operate  DFW  to  the  exclusion  of  all  other  air-
ports.  This  provision  was  part  of  the  House  version  of  the  International  Air  Trans-
portation  Act  of  1979.  The  Senate,  however,  passed  no  comparable  provision  in  its 
companion bill of the International Air Transportation Act of 1979. 

Consequently,  a  compromise  was  reached  in  the  form  of  a  conference  substitute 
which specifically prohibited Love Field from being used for interstate air transpor-
tation  of  passengers  unless  it  met  one  of  three  exceptions.  The  first  exception  per-
mitted  turn-around  service  between  Love  Field  and  points  within  the  contiguous 
states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas provided that the 
air carrier did not permit through servicing or ticketing and did not offer transpor-
tation service outside these states. The second exception permitted charter air trans-
portation provided that these charters did not exceed 10 flights per month. Finally, 
the  third  exception  permitted  air  transportation  provided  by  commuter  airlines  op-
erating aircraft with a passenger capacity of 56 passengers or less. 

The  Senate  agreed  to  this  Conference  Report  on  January  31,  1980;  while  the 
House  agreed  to  the  Conference  Report  on  February  4,  1980.  Subsequently,  the 
International  Air  Transportation  Act  of  1979,  and  more  particularly,  Section  29 
(more  commonly  known  as  the  ‘‘Love  Field  Amendment’’  and/or  ‘‘Wright  Amend-
ment’’) was enacted into law on February 15, 1980. 
Southwest Airlines was a Willing Participant in the Compromise 

As  embodied  in  the  Conference  Report,  Section  29  ‘‘provides  a  fair  and  equitable 
settlement  for  a  dispute  that  has  raged  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area  for  many 
years.  It  has  been  agreed  to  by  the  representatives  of  Southwest  Airlines,  the  City 
of  Dallas,  the  City  of  Fort  Worth,  DFW  Airport  authority,  and  related  constituent 
groups.’’  Thus,  the  Wright  Amendment  was  and  is  a  delicately  crafted  compromise 
designed  to  settle  a  historical  dispute  in  this  region.  More  importantly,  it  was  de-
signed to accomplish the goal initially outlined by the Federal Government to avoid 
a duplication of expenses, and resolve inadequate and incomplete air service to both 
cities. 

In an apparent attempt to rewrite history in hopes of building support for repeal-
ing  the  Wright  Amendment,  Southwest  Airlines  has  recently  attempted  to  distance 
itself  from  the  compromise  that  it  actually  helped  create.  It  might  be  of  interest  to 
this Subcommittee to learn that Southwest Airlines actually lobbied for the passage 
of  the  Wright  Amendment.  This  is  evidenced  in  a  letter  drafted  and  delivered  to 
both  House  and  Senate  conferees  on  December  11,  1979,  by  the  lead  lobbyist  for 
Southwest Airlines at the time, Mr. J.D. Williams. In the letter, Mr. Williams indi-
cates  that  he  ‘‘enclosed  . . .  a  copy  of  language  which  Southwest  Airlines  supports 
as  a  compromise  on  the  Love  Field  interstate  service  controversy.’’  He  goes  on  in 
the  letter  to  indicate  that  Southwest  Airlines  is  ‘‘pleased  that  the  parties  to  this 
long-standing  controversy  have  been  able  to  reach  this  compromise,  which  we  be-
lieve  to  be  the  only  viable  one.’’  Finally,  he  urges  the  conferees  for  their  ‘‘support’’ 
of this compromise.

Immediately after the passage of this compromise, Mr. Herb Kelleher, was quoted 
in  the  Fort  Worth  Star-Telegram  on  December  13,  1979,  fully  acknowledging  and 
accepting ‘‘the compromise as the ‘final resolution’ in their seven year fight over use 
of Dallas’ Love Field.’’ In that same article, he was quoted as saying that he is ‘‘per-
sonally  pleased  with  the  idea  that  this  will  finally  bring  peace  to  the  Dallas-Fort 
Worth  area.’’  Southwest  Airlines’  Herb  Kelleher  went  on  in  the  article  to  acknowl-
edge  that  his  company’s  growth  would  be  restricted  at  Love  Field  unless  it  chose 
to move some of its operations to DFW: 

‘‘Kelleher  disputed  Wright’s  contention  that  Southwest  will  have  to  pull  up  its 
Love  Field  stakes  and  move  to  DFW  Airport  if  it  hopes  to  grow.  However,  he 
conceded,  growth  of  Southwest’s  Dallas  operations  will  be  severely  restricted  if 
the airline doesn’t eventually make that move.’’ 

Thus,  immediately  following  passage  of  the  Wright  Amendment,  Mr.  Kelleher 
fully  understood  that  the  compromise  to  which  he  agreed  would  ultimately  require 
him to run a split operation at Love Field and at DFW International Airport. 

In  its  own  media  release,  dated  December  17,  1979,  Southwest  Airlines  admitted 
that  the  Wright  Amendment  is  a  compromise  that  prevents  Love  Field  from  ever 
competing with DFW Airport: 

‘‘Herb  D.  Kelleher,  Chairman  of  the  Board,  said,  ‘Although  the  compromise 
amendment  very  substantially  curtails  the  amount  of  interstate  air  service 
Southwest  can  provide  from  Love  Field  and  also  effectively  prevents  Love  from 
ever  becoming  an  interline  or  connecting  complex  competitive  with  DFW  Air-
port,  we  are  nonetheless  happy  that  peace  has  been  achieved  after  nearly  ten 
years  of  controversy.  Southwest  Airlines  can  now  proceed  with  its  long-term 
route planning and concentrate fully on the profitable management and expan-
sion  of  the  airline.  Hopefully,  the  time-consuming  and  expensive  legal  battles 
of the last decade are behind us.’ ’’ 

A year later, when confronted with the threat of Texas International flying inter-
state  traffic  out  of  Love  Field,  Southwest  urged  Dallas,  Fort  Worth,  and  DFW  offi-
cials  to  honor  the  compromise.  In  a  memorandum  from  Mr.  Kelleher  dated  August 
4,  1980,  to  the  members  of  the  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  City  Councils  and  the  mem-
bers  of  the  DFW  Regional  Airport  Board  he  stated  that,  ‘‘We  have  abided  by  the 
‘Love  Field  Compromise’  in  good  faith  and  we  feel  confident  that  each  of  you  will 
want to do the same.’’ 

In  fact,  Southwest  actually  attempted  to  use  the  Wright  Amendment  to  keep  its 
competitors  out  of  Love  Field  when  it  filed  a  response  to  Texas  International’s  pro-
posed  service  out  of  Love  Field  on  August  23,  1980.  In  that  filing,  Southwest  Air-
lines chastised the Civil Aeronautics Board: 

‘‘The Love Field Legislation was intended to settle once and for all the ‘dispute 
that  has  raged  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area  for  many  years.  Now,  TI  [Texas 
International]  seeks  to  reopen  that  fight  and  upset  the  delicate  balance  which 
has  brought  peace  for  the  first  time  in  over  a  decade.  Congressional  intent  to 
the  contrary  is  clear.  Southwest  does  not  object  to  TI  using  Love  for  intrastate 
flights (which apparently is all it wants to do) so long as the law is obeyed and 
TI’s  certificate  properly  reflects  what  it  may  and  may  not  do.  There  is  simply 
no  reason  for  the  [Civil  Aeronautics]  Board  to  raise  again  the  spectre  of  full 
scale  commercial  use  of  Love  Field  which  has  exacerbated  this  situation  for  so 
long, and which Congress has been to such pains to exorcise.’’ 

Similarly, in 1985, Southwest Airlines urged the Department of Transportation to 
limit Love Field to short-haul service as originally envisioned in the Wright Amend-
ment when it filed Comments of Southwest Airlines in Response to Order 85–7–65, 
dated  August  23,  1985.  In  that  filing,  attorneys  for  Southwest  argued  that  there 
were severe local concerns that must be considered: 

‘‘The Department should respect the will of Congress and recognize the Amend-
ment for what it is—a congressional declaration that in this one instance, com-
petition  should  be  limited  to  carriers  which  emphasize  short-haul,  turnaround 
service and which restrict their size by refraining from interlining anywhere on 
their  systems.  Congress  endorsed  this  Love  Field  compromise  in  recognition  of 
severe local concerns, and in the interest of peace.’’ 

In  fact,  Southwest’s  own  attorneys  in  that  same  filing  stated  that  ‘‘the  conferees 
obviously  thought  they  were  enacting  into  law  the  agreement  and  understanding 
reached between Southwest and the Texas civic parties.’’ 

In another docket filed by Southwest Airlines in its Reply Comments in the Love 
Field Amendment Proceedings (Docket 43307) filed by Herbert D. Kelleher and Paul

Y. Seligson on August 30, 1985, Southwest argued that Congress should rebuff any 
efforts by any carrier, including Continental Airlines, to change the Wright Amend-
ment. Specifically, Southwest argued that ‘‘should Continental now address its pleas 
to Congress, where they properly belong, the legislators would doubtless be tempted 
to  reply  in  the  words  of  Lewis  Carroll:  ‘I  have  said  it  three  times,  and  that  is 
enough. Be off, or I’ll kick you downstairs.’ ’’ 

As  late  as  1989,  Mr.  Kelleher  acknowledged  that  he  had  pledged  not  to  overturn 
the  Wright  Amendment  when  he  stated  in  an  interview  with  Financial  World,  on 
March  21,  1989,  that  ‘‘operationally,  it’s  [the  Wright  Amendment]  extremely  dif-
ficult,  but  I  pledged  we  wouldn’t  seek  to  overturn  it.’’  In  fact,  in  an  interview  with 
the  Fort  Worth  Star-Telegram  on  April  30,  1992,  Mr.  Kelleher  conceded  that  any 
changes to the Wright Amendment should involve all parties: 

‘‘ ‘Obviously, if you look at it from a technical legal standpoint, it takes the U.S. 
Congress  to  change  the  Wright  Amendment.  Since  we  are  neutral  on  the  sub-
ject, we are neither happy or disappointed,’ Kelleher said. ‘I’ve made statements 
many  times  that  we’d  be  willing  to  abide  by  what’s  agreeable  to  the  parties.’ ’’ 
Obviously,  there  is  more  than  ample  evidence  that  Southwest  Airlines  supported 
passage of the Wright Amendment, attempted to use it to prevent carriers from en-
tering  Love  Field,  lobbied  the  Department  of  Transportation  to  fulfill  its  intent, 
urged  all  parties  to  honor  the  agreement,  and  suggested  Congress  should  kick  out 
anyone  who  seeks  to  alter  the  agreement.  As  John  Adams  once  wrote,  ‘‘[f]acts  are 
stubborn  things;  and  whatever  may  be  our  wishes,  our  inclinations,  or  the  dictates 
of our passion, they cannot alter the state of the facts and evidence.’’ Unfortunately, 
despite  the  25  years  of  neutrality  on  the  issue  and  Mr.  Kelleher’s  public  pledge  to 
support  the  compromise,  the  current  management  team  now  seeks  to  ignore  the 
facts, and Mr. Kelleher’s pledge. 
Southwest Airlines Has Flourished in its Safe-Harbor at Love Field 

Southwest  Airlines  has  recently  argued  that  it  has  labored  under  this  com-
promise.  Again,  the  evidence  belies  this  argument.  The  reality  is  that  Southwest 
Airlines  was  able  to  operate  at  Love  Field  in  a  protected  and  safe-harbor  environ-
ment  insulated  from  the  other  airlines  which  had  signed  DFW’s  Use  Agreement 
that, at the time, contractually prohibited them from returning to Love Field. 

Today,  Southwest  Airlines  garners  an  unprecedented  97  percent  seat  share  of 
commercial  air  traffic  into  and  out  of  Love  Field.  There  is  no  other  major  airport 
in  the  United  States  dominated  more  by  a  single  carrier  than  Dallas  Love  Field. 
To  put  that  in  perspective,  prior  to  Delta’s  recent  elimination  of  its  hub  at  Dallas/ 
Fort Worth International Airport, American Airlines’ largest seat share was 73 per-
cent. After Delta’s recent elimination of its hub, American Airlines garners approxi-
mately 83 percent seat share, a full 10 percentage points less than what Southwest 
currently maintains at Love Field. 

More importantly, Southwest’s virtual monopoly at Love Field has permitted it to 
garner the highest yield of any airport that Southwest Airlines has served over the 
last five years. This was documented in a recent report authored by Professor Bijan 
Vasigh of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In Professor Vasigh’s report, which 
was published on October 18, 2005, he analyzed the airports with the highest yields 
for  Southwest  Airlines  from  1999  to  2004.  Eight  of  the  top  ten  markets  are  within 
a  narrow  stage  length  band.  Of  these  eight,  Southwest  Airlines’  highest  yield  was 
achieved  at  Love  Field  with  a  21.02  cent  average  yield  per  passenger  mile.  This 
yield  was  3  cents  higher  than  the  next  closest  airport  from  which  it  operates.  Fac-
toring out Dallas Love Field, the median for the remaining seven airports over that 
same  time  period  was  16.47  cents  per  passenger  mile,  or  4.6  cents  below  the  yield 
achieved  at  Love  Field.  Thus,  Southwest  Airlines  commands  a  28  percent  premium 
out  of  Love  Field.  In  short,  it  is  hard  to  fathom  how  Southwest  has  labored  under 
the Wright Amendment when it maintains such a dominance at Love Field and can 
demand the highest yield per passenger mile of any market in which it serves. 
Wright  Amendment  Permits  Southwest  Airlines  to  Fly  Anywhere  in  the 

United States 

A  little  known  fact  is  that  Southwest  Airlines  has  the  right  to  fly  today  out  of 
Love  Field  under  the  Wright  Amendment  to  any  destination  across  the  United 
States.  As  I  described  earlier,  the  Wright  Amendment  permits  any  aircraft  with  56 
seats  or  less  to  fly  anywhere  in  the  United  States  that  Southwest  Airlines,  or  any 
other  carrier,  desires.  Now  Southwest  Airlines  will  undoubtedly  respond  that  it 
doesn’t  own  any  jet  that  has  56  seats.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  it  could,  like 
every other carrier, make a business decision to buy regional jets that have 56 seats,

or form an alliance with another regional carrier or affiliate that possesses regional 
jets. 

Instead  of  flying  within  the  law,  Southwest  Airlines  has  needlessly  plunged  the 
North  Texas  community  into  a  very  divisive  debate.  The  fact  that  Southwest  Air-
lines chooses not to buy 56-seat regional jets or to form an alliance with an affiliate 
company is a decision that Southwest has a right to make; however, one company’s 
business decision should not dictate a change in good, sound public policy which has 
served  this  community  well  for  the  last  25  years  and  has  been  relied  upon  by  so 
many. 
Current Financial Challenge Facing DFW Airport 

In  1997,  after  waiting  for  a  final  interpretation  by  the  courts  over  the  Shelby 
Amendment and assessing the implications it would have on service levels at DFW 
Airport, the Airport embarked upon an extensive capital development plan designed 
to  improve  and  expand  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  Airport.  This  $2.7  billion 
Capital  Development  Plan  was  supported  and  authorized  by  the  airlines,  the  DFW 
Airport  Board,  the  City  of  Dallas,  and  the  City  of  Fort  Worth.  After  a  series  of  un-
precedented  and  unpredictable  challenges  including  the  terrorist  attacks  of  Sep-
tember 11th, SARS, and the overall financial instability of the airline industry, this 
eight-year Capital Development Program came to a successful end. 

The program culminated with the opening of the new Skylink airport train, which 
opened  to  the  public  on  May  21,  2005,  and  now  connects  all  of  the  airport’s  termi-
nals by rail. Shortly thereafter, International Terminal D was opened to the fanfare 
of  the  traveling  public  on  July  23,  2005.  These  two  projects,  combined  with  other 
airfield  and  roadway  improvements,  increased  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International 
Airport Board’s debt from $676 million to $3.8 billion, nearly a six-fold increase. 

The airport judiciously pursued this long-term investment, completing the project 
on  time  and  under  budget  in  the  face  of  these  unprecedented  challenges.  Fortu-
nately,  DFW  Airport  was  able  to  maintain  a  competitive  cost  structure  well  in  line 
with  other  peer  airports  across  the  country.  Although  this  increase  in  the  airport’s 
debt load was anticipated, no one expected or could have predicted that on the heels 
of  this  investment,  Delta  Air  Lines  would  abandon  its  hub  at  DFW,  jet  fuel  prices 
would  hit  an  all  time  high,  and  Southwest  Airlines  would  call  for  repeal  of  the 
Wright Amendment. 
Delta Air Lines’ Decision to Eliminate Its Hub 

In February of this year, Delta Air Lines eliminated its hub at Dallas/Fort Worth 
International  Airport  as  part  of  a  larger  restructuring  of  the  airline.  At  the  time, 
Delta  Air  Lines  was  DFW  Airport’s  second  largest  carrier,  with  566  flights  to  and 
from  72  non-stop  destinations.  By  the  end  of  February,  Delta  Air  Lines  had  elimi-
nated  522  of  these  flights  and  reduced  its  service  to  just  three  destinations—Salt 
Lake City, Cincinnati, and Atlanta. With the elimination of its hub, Delta Air Lines’ 
gate  requirement  fell  from  28  gates  it  used  to  operate  in  Terminal  E  to  just  four. 
Three  of  these  28  gates  have  subsequently  been  re-leased  to  AirTran  Airways;  un-
fortunately,  as  of  today,  DFW  Airport  still  has  21  gates  that  remain  unleased  in 
Terminal E. 

Obviously, Delta Air Lines’ decision to eliminate its hub had a significant impact 
on the North Texas economy. In a study performed by Bernard L. Weinstein, Ph.D., 
and Terry L. Clower, Ph.D., from the University of North Texas, it is estimated that 
more  than  7,000  jobs  were  lost  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area,  $344  million  in  lost 
salaries  and  wages,  and  more  than  $782  million  in  total  losses  to  the  North  Texas 
economy  on  an  annualized  basis.  By  any  measurement,  this  was  a  serious  blow  to 
DFW Airport and the North Texas economy. 

It bears noting that only after DFW Airport completed the financing of its Capital 
Development Program and only after Delta Air Lines eliminated its hub, did South-
west Airlines choose to abandon its 25-year stance of ‘‘passionate neutrality’’ on the 
Wright  Amendment  and  plunge  this  community  into  this  caustic  and  divisive  de-
bate. 
The Traveling Public Wants Southwest Airlines at DFW Airport 

In  the  face  of  Delta  Air  Lines’  elimination  of  its  hub,  DFW  Airport  has  been  ag-
gressively  targeting  both  new  carriers  and  existing  carriers  to  backfill  the  service 
lost  as  a  result  of  Delta’s  decision.  In  fact,  virtually  every  low-cost  airline  has  been 
approached by DFW Airport, with Southwest Airlines on the top of that list. 

It  should  be  no  surprise  that  the  traveling  public  wants  Southwest  Airlines  at 
DFW International Airport. In a formal survey conducted by the International Ford 
Group  between  July  2  and  July  5,  2005,  more  than  2,700  travelers  were  sampled. 
They  were  asked  a  simple  question:  Do  you  want  Southwest  Airlines  to  begin  serv-
ice at DFW International Airport? The response to that simple question was nothing

short of overwhelming. Of the more than 2,700 travelers sampled, 62 percent want-
ed Southwest Airlines to initiate service from DFW International Airport. When you 
factor  out  those  who  expressed  no  opinion  on  the  issue,  the  results  are  even  more 
compelling.  Eighty-five  percent  of  those  who  had  an  opinion  on  the  issue  wanted 
Southwest Airlines to initiate service at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. 

Recognizing  that  travelers  want  Southwest  Airlines  to  begin  service  from  DFW 
Airport, and recognizing that DFW Airport had 21 vacant and available gates, DFW 
Airport  placed  an  unprecedented  offer  on  the  table  in  an  attempt  to  attract  South-
west  Airlines  to  DFW.  The  offer  itself  is  valued  at  more  than  $22  million  and  in-
cludes  one  year  of  free  rent,  the  acquisition  of  ground  service  equipment,  capital 
funding for facility improvements, and cooperative marketing funds. 

Unfortunately,  Southwest  Airlines  has  repeatedly  rebuffed  DFW’s  offer  despite 
the fact that it both publicly and privately admitted that it can operate at DFW Air-
port.  Since  these  early  admissions,  Southwest  has  attempted  to  concoct  new  and 
varied  excuses  as  to  why  it  refuses  to  operate  from  DFW  Airport.  The  most  recent 
claims include that DFW is too congested, that Southwest Airlines cannot run split 
operations between two airports, and that DFW is too expensive. 

Again, the claims are baseless. Today, Southwest Airlines flies out of seven of the 
country’s  busiest  airports,  all  more  congested  than  DFW  Airport.  Based  upon  the 
U.S.  Bureau  of  Transportation  statistics,  Baltimore/Washington,  Chicago  Midway, 
Philadelphia,  Las  Vegas,  Los  Angeles,  Phoenix,  and  Detroit  all  had  a  higher  per-
centage  of  flight  delays  in  the  first  quarter  of  2005  than  DFW  Airport.  Similarly, 
Southwest  Airlines  serves  other  metropolitan  areas  out  of  multiple  airports  includ-
ing  southern  Florida,  where  Southwest  Airlines  serves  both  West  Palm  Beach  and 
Ft.  Lauderdale  airports,  and  in  the  Los  Angeles  basin,  where  Southwest  Airlines 
serves  four  airports,  including  Burbank,  Los  Angeles,  Ontario,  and  Santa  Ana.  It 
should also be noted that until this effort to repeal the Wright Amendment was an-
nounced,  Southwest  also  served  both  Houston  George  Bush  Intercontinental  and 
Houston Hobby. 

In terms of cost, Southwest Airlines flies today out of eight airports that are more 
expensive  on  a  net  cost  per  enplaned  passenger  basis  than  DFW  Airport.  Based 
upon  the  data  compiled  by  Leigh  Fischer  and  Associates  from  airport  sources,  air-
ports  with  a  higher  net  cost  per  enplaned  passenger  than  DFW  Airport’s  current 
cost  of  $8.30  include  Ontario  at  $12.05,  Portland  at  $11.74,  Seattle-Tacoma  at 
$11.41,  Pittsburgh  at  $11.02,  New  Orleans  at  $9.18,  Philadelphia  at  $9.09,  Albu-
querque at $8.36, and Austin at $8.31. The most compelling example, however, lies 
in Southwest Airlines’ recent announcement that it will initiate service into Denver 
International  Airport.  Today,  Denver  International  Airport  has  a  net  cost  per  en-
planed  passenger  of  $13.05,  which  is  57  percent  more  than  DFW  Airport’s  net  cost 
per  enplaned  passenger.  Obviously,  if  Southwest  can  operate  from  one  of  the  most 
expensive airports in the country, it can easily do so at DFW. 

The simple and undeniable fact is that Southwest can and should leave its short- 
haul  traffic  at  Love  Field  and  initiate  long-haul  traffic  at  DFW  Airport  exactly  as 
Mr.  Kelleher  predicted  his  company  would  need  to  do  in  1979  when  the  Wright 
Amendment  was  passed.  This  ‘‘split  operation’’  is  precisely  what  Continental  Air-
lines does today. Continental Airlines operates short-haul flights from Love Field to 
Houston  while  also  operating  long-haul  flights  from  DFW  Airport  to  Cleveland  and 
Newark. 

Despite the rhetoric to the contrary, it is not a piece of legislation that is holding 
back  Southwest  Airlines’  service,  but  a  conscious  decision  on  the  part  of  Southwest 
Airlines’ management team. Every other carrier serving North Texas, including five 
other low cost carriers, soon to be six when Spirit Airlines initiates service on Janu-
ary 10th, operates from DFW Airport. Not one of these six low cost carriers has seen 
the  need  nor  the  wisdom  in  asking  Congress  to  intervene  on  their  behalf.  Instead, 
they simply have chosen to compete. 
Impacts of Repeal on Love Field 

In the frenzy to paint this issue as one of ‘‘competition’’ and ‘‘low fares,’’ few have 
taken the time to focus upon the consequences of repealing the Wright Amendment. 
The  impacts  will  be  significant  and  are  supported  by  sound  data  and  credible  ex-
perts.  The  first  and  most  obvious  to  be  impacted  are  the  homeowners  and  business 
owners around Love Field. 

In  attempting  to  sidestep  the  impacts  associated  with  reopening  Love  Field, 
Southwest Airlines readily cites the Love Field Master Plan and the company’s will-
ingness to abide by that Plan. What Southwest Airlines fails to acknowledge is that 
the  Master  Plan  assumed  that  there  would  be  no  further  changes  to  the  Wright 
Amendment.  The  Love  Field  Master  Plan  also  contemplated  that  any  growth  at 
Love  Field  would  occur  on  regional  jet  aircraft  not  on  mainline  jet  aircraft.  It  was 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

52 

precisely these two assumptions that led all parties, especially the residents around 
Love Field, to reach an agreement to support the Master Plan. 

To  quantify  this  impact,  two  independent  studies  from  two  separate  and  well  re-
spected  aviation  consulting  firms  conducted  an  analysis  on  repealing  the  Wright 
Amendment.  The  first  study,  performed  by  Simat,  Helliesen  &  Eichner,  Inc. 
(SH&E), concluded that, even assuming the Love Field Master Plan was enforceable 
and viable in the face of a repeal of the Wright Amendment, an additional 312 air-
craft operations would occur daily at Love Field. SH&E then took their analysis one 
step  further  and  assumed  that  if  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan  is  ultimately  deemed 
no  longer  viable,  then  Love  Field  could  see  an  increase  of  as  many  as  484  flights 
a  day.  In  a  separate  study,  the  Eclat  Consulting  firm  came  to  a  similar  conclusion 
and  estimated  that  Dallas  Love  Field  could  experience  251  additional  daily  flights 
if the Wright Amendment were repealed. 

Equally  disturbing  is  the  size  of  the  jets  that  will  be  flown  and  the  impact  these 
jets will have on passenger traffic and the noise around Love Field. The Love Field 
Master  Plan  assumed  and  modeled  a  mere  one  percent  increase  in  mainline  jets. 
However,  the  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  will  result  in  significant  growth  in 
large  aircraft  departures  as  Southwest  Airlines,  American  Airlines,  and  other  car-
riers  respond  to  the  change  in  the  law.  Based  upon  2005  operational  levels,  SH&E 
projects  that  large  jets  operating  from  Love  Field  will  grow  133  percent  if  the 
Wright  Amendment  is  repealed,  assuming  the  32-gate  limit  in  the  Master  Plan 
holds. Without such a gate limit, SH&E predicts that large jets will grow an aston-
ishing 208 percent. 

With  this  explosion  in  service  at  Love  Field,  passengers  are  projected  to  increase 
by as many as 16 million passengers on an annualized basis, growing from 6.6 mil-
lion to upwards of 22 million, representing a staggering 234 percent growth in terms 
of  passengers.  In  contrast,  the  Master  Plan  that  was  agreed  to  by  both  Southwest 
Airlines  and  the  neighborhoods  only  contemplated  passenger  growth  at  14  percent 
between  2005  and  2020  because  it  assumed  growth  on  regional  jets  and  because  it 
assumed the Wright Amendment would remain undisturbed. 

Obviously,  such  an  impact  would  put  a  strain  on  existing  facilities  and  roadway 
infrastructure.  Residents  and  businesses  around  Love  Field  will  also  experience  a 
substantial  increase  in  both  noise  and  emissions.  A  simple  thing  such  as  a  change 
in  fleet  mix  can  have  a  dramatic  impact  on  noise  levels  in  and  around  Love  Field. 
As  an  example,  American  Airlines  will  likely  fly  McDonnell  Douglas  (MD)  80s  out 
of Love Field. From a noise perspective, an MD 80 departure is, on average, 10 deci-
bels  louder  than  the  average  noise  of  an  Embraer  regional  jet  on  departure  which 
was  modeled  under  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan.  To  put  that  in  perspective,  a  10 
decibel increase in noise is perceived by the human ear as being twice as loud. 

Another  way  to  assess  the  potential  impact  is  to  compare  the  noise  footprints  of 
these  jets.  Based  upon  two  independent  analyses,  one  done  by  NASA  Langley  Re-
search  Center  in  September  2003  and  the  other  by  Wiley  Acoustics  done  in  August 
2005, a departure of a Boeing 737–300 has an 80 decibel single event noise contour 
which  covers  approximately  5.5  to  5.8  square  miles.  In  contrast,  an  MD  80  has  an 
80  decibels  single  event  noise  contour  which  covers  17  square  miles.  In  layman’s 
terms,  the  size  of  the  area  that  will  experience  a  single  event  noise  contour  of  80 
decibels,  when  American  Airlines  is  forced  to  compete  at  Love  Field  and  deploys 
their  MD  80s,  is  three  times  larger  than  the  current  footprint  experienced  today 
when Southwest departs a Boeing 737 jet. 

Fortunately, DFW Airport’s large land mass of more than 18,000 acres serves, in 
part, as a buffer, protecting the surrounding homeowners and business owners from 
both  the  environmental  and  operational  impacts  associated  with  operating  an  air-
port.  With  only  1,300  acres,  Love  Field  simply  does  not  have  a  buffer.  It  also  does 
not have the roadway infrastructure to handle the expected tripling of traffic which 
is  projected.  Reopening  Love  Field  will  undoubtedly  have  a  negative  impact  on 
noise,  emissions,  and  the  quality  of  life  for  those  who  live  and  work  in  and  around 
Love  Field.  Unfortunately,  this  is  not  what  the  residents  bargained  for  when  they 
agreed to the Love Field Master Plan. 
Impacts of Repeal on DFW Airport 

The  SH&E  study  also  focused  upon  the  impact  to  DFW  Airport  if  the  Wright 
Amendment  were  repealed.  Given  the  projected  growth  at  Love  Field,  SH&E  con-
cluded  that  DFW  will  lose  a  substantial  amount  of  traffic.  In  fact,  SH&E  predicts 
that  DFW  could  lose  as  many  as  408  daily  flights,  or  20  percent  of  DFW’s  current 
operations,  and  as  many  as  21  million  passengers  annually,  representing  a  35  per-
cent decline from current levels. With this substantial loss, DFW Airport passenger 
levels  will  decrease  to  levels  seen  20  years  ago,  and  it  will  take  another  19  years 
for  traffic  just  to  recover  to  current  levels.  In  short,  repealing  the  Wright  Amend-

ment will amount to a 39 year penalty for DFW International Airport, the traveling 
community  and  businesses  that  have  come  to  rely  on  DFW’s  economic  vitality,  and 
the airlines which moved to DFW in reliance upon the closure of Love Field. Equal-
ly, if not more important, will be the untold impact on the lives of the 268,500 men 
and women who have their jobs tied to DFW Airport. 

The  Eclat  study  also  predicts  that  many  cities  are  at  risk  of  losing  some  or  all 
of its air service as DFW’s hub is drained of passengers. The Eclat study attempted 
to  categorize  the  cities  by  risk.  In  terms  of  those  ‘‘most  at  risk,’’  there  are  15  cities 
that  would  likely  lose  some  or  all  of  their  air  service.  Cities  such  as  Waco,  Texas; 
Fayetteville,  Arkansas;  and  Springfield,  Missouri  all  topped  the  list  of  those  most 
likely  to  lose  service.  There  were  an  additional  50  cities  identified  as  at  ‘‘moderate 
risk.’’ These cities spanned all parts of the country and included cities such as Day-
ton,  Ohio;  Birmingham,  Alabama;  Orange  County,  California;  and  Louisville,  Ken-
tucky.  The  Eclat  study  also  identified  15  international  cities  that  are  likely  to  lose 
flights  as  a  result  of  less  connecting  traffic  and  the  ultimate  degradation  of  DFW 
Airport’s  hub.  Cities  identified  as  candidates  to  lose  service  include  Lima,  Peru; 
Santiago, Chile; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and London, England, just to name a few. 

Having just added $2.7 billion in new debt, while facing the prospect of losing 21 
million  passengers,  408  daily  flights,  and  a  significant  number  of  domestic  and 
international  destinations,  DFW  Airport  would  be  under  severe  financial  stress  at 
a time when it is least equipped to handle it. As an example, if the Wright Amend-
ment  is  repealed,  it  is  conservatively  estimated  that  35  gates  would  sit  empty  and 
unused. To put that in perspective, San Antonio International Airport has 28 gates 
in  total,  Austin-Bergstrom  International  Airport  has  25  gates,  Mineta  San  Jose´ 
International  Airport  has  32  gates,  and  Indianapolis  International  Airport  has  35 
gates.  DFW  would  have  vacant  and  idle  the  rough  equivalent  of  the  total  number 
of gates at each of these airports. 

Repealing  the  Wright  Amendment  will  also  have  a  dramatic  impact  upon  DFW’s 
cost  structure.  DFW’s  net  cost  per  enplaned  passenger  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  is  pro-
jected at $8.30. If efforts to repeal the Wright Amendment are successful, DFW Air-
port’s  cost  is  projected  to  increase  54  percent  to  $12.81,  assuming  that  the  Love 
Field  Master  Plan  remains  intact.  If  the  plan  is  deemed  unenforceable,  and  Love 
Field  traffic  could  grow  uninhibited,  it  is  estimated  that  DFW’s  net  cost  per  en-
planed  passenger  would  increase  almost  100  percent  to  $16.47.  Without  question, 
this would have a dramatic impact upon DFW Airport’s cost structure and its ability 
to attract new air service, creating a potentially irreversible downward spiral. 

If  these  predictions  were  not  in  and  of  themselves  sufficient  reason  to  abandon 
any efforts to repeal the Wright Amendment, then I would respectfully suggest that 
Congress  heed  the  warnings  of  another  expert—Mr.  Herb  Kelleher.  Mr.  Kelleher 
testified under oath in a deposition in a lawsuit styled Zamutt v. Skinner, U.S. Dis-
trict Court of California, October 8, 1990. In that deposition, Mr. Kelleher was asked 
whether  or  not  Southwest  supported  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment.  He  an-
swered, ‘‘No, we do not.’’ When asked why, he responded as follows: 

‘‘Well,  we  think  that  there  is  some  merit  to  the  position  that  there  is  no  city 
in  the  United  States  that  has  two  full-fledged  hubs  competing  against  one  an-
other  successfully.  There  are  cities  that  have  a  main  airport  and  satellite  air-
ports which live well in a complementary relationship, harmonious relationship; 
and  we  too  have  to  agree  as  a  matter  of  logic  and  principle  that  if  you  allowed 
Love  Field  to  come  up  as  a  full-fledged  hub  in  opposition  to  DFW  Airport  that 
indeed  air  service  to  the  Metroplex  would  suffer  to  some  extent  because  basi-
cally a hub-and-spoke system depends for its success upon attracting passengers 
from  a  multitude  of  spokes  that  will  fill  up  an  airplane  going  to  another  des-
tination. If you divide that type of operation between two airports, you’re likely 
to lose service to some of the smaller cities.’’ 

Mr. Kelleher’s statement was accurate when he responded under oath in 1990 and 
remains  accurate  today.  It  should  serve  as  a  warning  to  any  and  all  who  want  to 
repeal the Wright Amendment that there will be serious consequences. 
Potential Impacts of Repeal on Fares 

Recently,  Southwest  Airlines  commissioned  The  Campbell-Hill  Aviation  Group, 
Inc. (Campbell-Hill) in an effort to support its proposition that repeal of the Wright 
Amendment will result in lower airfares. In fact, Southwest Airlines has hinged its 
entire  argument  for  repeal  around  wanting  to  bring  low  fares  to  North  Texas  trav-
elers. A close analysis of this report reveals that it is based upon a series of flawed 
assumptions. 

Recently,  a  professor  from  the  Embry-Riddle  Aeronautical  University,  Bijan 
Vasigh,  undertook  an  analysis  of  the  Campbell-Hill  report.  His  findings  were  quite 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

54 

telling.  Professor  Vasigh  concluded  in  his  analysis  that  the  Campbell-Hill  ‘‘report 
works under the assumption that there are currently no low cost carriers at Dallas- 
Fort Worth International Airport.’’ As you will learn in a moment, this is a blatantly 
false assumption. Professor Vasigh goes on to point out that the Campbell-Hill study 
‘‘relies upon pricing and market stimulation assumptions that are more than a dec-
ade  old  in  an  industry  where  prices  change  by  the  thousands  every  day.’’  Finally, 
Professor Vasigh points out that the Campbell-Hill study ‘‘gives no credit to the fact 
that  airfares  were  restructured  earlier  this  year  in  all  DFW  domestic  markets,  re-
ducing  the  average  fare  paid  by  DFW  passengers.’’  In  short,  Professor  Vasigh  con-
cludes that Southwest’s fortress strategy in repealing the Wright Amendment is not 
about  a  more  competitive  market  and  lower  prices,  but  rather  it  is  about  the  con-
centration of its monopoly power at Dallas Love Field. 

In  support  of  this  conclusion,  we  would  respectfully  offer  the  following  indis-
putable  facts.  The  fares  at  DFW  have  been  dramatically  falling  as  carriers  adapt 
to the changing marketplace. As an example, American Airlines fares at DFW have 
fallen 32 percent since year ending First Quarter 2001. In contrast, Southwest Air-
lines  fares  at  Love  Field  have  fallen  over  that  same  time  period  by  three  percent. 
DFW’s average domestic one-way fare declined from $218 in the First Quarter 2001 
to $157 in the First Quarter 2005. In fact, just in the last year, from First Quarter 
2004  through  First  Quarter  2005,  DFW’s  average  fare  has  declined  11.4  percent, 
well ahead of the national average of six percent. 

Today,  at  DFW  Airport,  approximately  25  percent  of  all  one-way  fares  are  less 
than  $100.  This  is  directly  attributable  to  American  Airlines  restructuring  its  fares 
in the last year and the impact of the five low cost carriers that have chosen to offer 
service from DFW Airport. Despite Campbell-Hill’s incorrect assumption to the con-
trary,  AirTran  Airways,  ATA,  US  Airways,  Frontier,  and  Sun  Country  Airlines  all 
compete  head-to-head  against  American  Airlines  at  DFW  Airport,  with  Spirit  Air-
lines initiating service in January. 

It  should  not  go  unnoticed  that  Southwest  Airlines’  decision  to  announce  the  end 
of  its  ‘‘passionate  neutrality’’  on  the  Wright  Amendment  occurred  just  as  the  low 
cost  carriers’  seat  share  at  DFW  was  on  the  rise.  When  looking  at  low  fare  carrier 
seats  at  both  DFW  Airport  and  Love  Field,  low  cost  carriers  at  DFW  had  grown 
from  15  percent  of  the  North  Texas  marketplace  (where  Southwest  dominated  hav-
ing 85 percent of the low cost seats in the marketplace) to 25 percent in November 
2004. This had the effect of reducing Southwest’s low cost seat share dominance by 
a full ten percentage points in the DFW marketplace. 

We  are  firmly  convinced  that,  at  least  in  part,  Southwest’s  efforts  to  repeal  the 
Wright  Amendment  are  in  direct  response  to  the  fact  that  low  cost  carriers  were 
growing  at  DFW  Airport  and  providing  competitive  low  cost  service  to  14  markets 
across  the  United  States.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  these  same  low  cost  carriers 
have  one-stop  connections  to  almost  150  markets  in  the  United  States.  To  put  that 
in  perspective,  of  DFW’s  total  origin  and  destination  passenger  traffic,  more  than 
80  percent  of  DFW’s  passengers  can  reach  their  destination  on  a  low  cost  carrier 
from  DFW  Airport.  Today,  more  than  one  out  of  eight  local  passengers  flying  into 
and out of DFW Airport fly on low cost carriers. 

The fact is that DFW already has low cost carrier service in six of the 15 markets 
modeled  and  proffered  by  Southwest  Airlines’  Campbell-Hill  study.  As  accurately 
concluded by Professor Vasigh in his report: 

‘‘Economic  theory  does  not  discriminate  between  traditional  and  low  cost  car-
riers  in  regard  to  being  a  monopoly.  But  the  facts  are  that  American  Airlines 
has  ample  competition  at  DFW  to  discipline  the  marketplace,  while  Southwest 
has virtually none at DAL.’’ 

In  short,  we  would  respectfully  suggest  that  Southwest’s  efforts  to  repeal  the 
Wright  Amendment  have  very  little  to  do  with  providing  low  fare  service  to  the 
traveling public, and everything to do with continuing to dominate the market from 
its  fortress  position  at  Dallas  Love  Field.  Unfortunately  Southwest  Airlines’  efforts 
have  resulted  in  ‘chilling’  the  competitive  marketplace  in  North  Texas  by  waging 
this needless debate over the Wright Amendment. 
Competition Among Airlines is Great 

No  one  can  legitimately  question  the  fact  that  it  was  good  public  policy  back  in 
1965  when  the  Federal  Government  urged  the  City  of  Dallas  and  the  City  of  Fort 
Worth  to  unite  and  build  what  by  any  measurement  has  become  the  economic  en-
gine  connecting  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  residents  to  destinations  around  the  globe. 
Today, based upon a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) study, DFW Air-
port  is  directly  and  indirectly  responsible  for  the  employment  of  268,500  men  and 
women. In terms of economic impact, TxDOT estimates that the airport contributes

$14.3  billion  to  the  economy  on  an  annualized  basis,  with  a  payroll  of  $6  billion. 
The  economic  engine  generates  activity  and  opportunities  for  a  diverse  set  of  busi-
nesses  and  business  owners.  Based  upon  DFW  Airport’s  latest  statistics,  minority- 
and  women-owned  businesses  generate  $154  million  in  annual  economic  activity, 
and  support  2,200  jobs  with  a  payroll  of  $56  million  from  activities  on  DFW  Inter-
national Airport. 

What  was  good  public  policy  in  1965  remains  good  public  policy  today.  It  is  the 
public  policy  of  building  a  large  airport  where  every  carrier  can  compete  effectively 
and fairly on the same level playing field. In fact, this public policy has been imple-
mented  across  the  country  and  has  become  the  standard  across  the  United  States 
when municipalities are considering building a new airport. 

In  virtually  every  case  where  a  new  airport  has  been  built  in  recent  history,  the 
older,  existing  airport  in  the  community  has  been  either  closed  completely  or  has 
been  permanently  limited  to  general  aviation.  Examples  include  Alexandria,  Lou-
isiana;  Cleveland,  Ohio;  Detroit,  Michigan;  Fort  Myers,  Florida;  Kansas  City,  Mis-
souri;  Killeen,  Texas;  Minneapolis/St.  Paul,  Minnesota;  Northwest  Arkansas;  and 
Seattle-Tacoma, Washington, just to name a few. 

The two most recent examples, however, are the most compelling. On the day that 
the  new  Denver  International  Airport  was  open  for  service,  Stapleton,  the  older 
inner-city  airport,  was  closed  permanently  to  all  operations.  Today,  the  Stapleton 
area  serves  as  a  shining  example  of  redevelopment  that  is  to  be  envied  across  the 
country. 

The  last  major  airport  to  be  built  was  in  Austin,  Texas.  In  that  case,  Robert 
Mueller  Municipal  Airport,  an  older  inner-city  airport,  was  also  closed  completely. 
At  the  time,  many  of  the  airlines  that  served  Robert  Mueller  Municipal  Airport  re-
fused  to  move  to  the  new  airport  until  there  was  a  contractual  commitment  on  the 
part of the City of Austin that Robert Mueller Municipal Airport would never again 
be  opened  for  commercial  air  service.  Southwest  Airlines  was  one  of  those  airlines 
that  benefited  from  the  closure  of  Robert  Mueller  Municipal  Airport.  It,  like  the 
other  airlines,  did  not  want  the  older  inner-city  airport  to  be  reopened  at  a  lower 
cost structure when all the other airlines had moved and were committed to the fi-
nancial viability of Austin’s new airport. 

In  a  twist  of  irony,  Southwest  Airlines  is  now  urging  to  completely  reopen  Love 
Field, an older, inner-city airport that was to be closed permanently. Southwest Air-
lines,  today,  the  largest  and  most  profitable  airline  in  the  industry,  is  asking  Con-
gress  to  intervene  to  further  exploit  its  monopolistic  position  at  Love  Field.  The 
Wright Amendment indeed allowed, at least in part, Southwest Airlines to grow and 
prosper  into  the  company  that  it  is  today.  Now,  it  is  asking  Congress  to  grant  it 
a  competitive  advantage  at  the  expense  of  all  the  other  airlines  which  have  relied 
upon and invested in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport over the last 31 years. 
Today, Southwest Airlines serves 61 markets. Southwest Airlines competes head- 
to-head  and  side-by-side  at  the  same  airport  with  American  Airlines  in  55  of  these 
61  markets,  or  90  percent  of  the  markets  served  by  Southwest  Airlines.  There  is 
simply  no  question  that  Southwest  Airlines  can  compete  in  its  hometown  at  DFW 
Airport. Instead, it is asking for Congress to intervene and give it a competitive ad-
vantage which it simply does not need nor does it deserve. 

Neither  a  business  model,  shareholder  profits,  nor  the  decision  of  a  single  man-
agement  team  should  abrogate  good  public  policy  relied  upon  by  so  many  over  the 
last 25 years. On behalf of DFW International Airport, the leaders who had the vi-
sion  and  tenacity  to  design  and  build  this  great  facility,  and  the  men  and  women 
who have the privilege and honor of operating this economic engine today, I respect-
fully urge you to rebuff any efforts to repeal the Wright Amendment. There is sim-
ply too much at stake.

Mr.  KELLEHER.—what  Mr.  Cox  said,  if  I  might.  I  have  the  origi-
nal  copy  of  my  deposition,  which  was  taken  in  1990,  in  a  suit  by 
the  State  of  Kansas  to  try  to  dissolve  the  Wright  Amendment  be-
cause  it  was  so  injurious  to  the  economy  of  Kansas.  And  so,  this 
was  taken  by  a  lawyer,  representing  Kansas,  trying  to  do  away 
with the Wright Amendment. 

And I’d like to, the first part—Mr. Cox said I lobbied for passage 
of  the  Wright  Amendment.  He  was  not  there.  This  is  just  part  of 
the  persiflage  that  DFW  Airport  puts  out.  I  lobbied  for  it,  I  wrote 
it. 

Jim  Wright’s  proposal  was  to  compromise  litigation.  I  had  won 
the litigation. I had won the litigation in the courts. I had won be-
fore the Civil Aeronautics Board. There was no recourse left. 
Senator MCCAIN. Mr. Kelleher, do you want to respond—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. In the proposed—— 
Senator MCCAIN.—to Mr. Cox? 
Senator BURNS. Yes, let’s do that. 
Mr. KELLEHER. Oh, excuse me. I’m sorry. Yes. What I was refer-
ring  to  is  that  part  of  this  deposition  is,  ‘‘So,  did  Southwest  accept 
that  compromise  at  that  time?’’  Answer—my  answer—‘‘I  guess  the 
same  way  the  Germans  accepted  the  end  of  the  first  World  War.’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. KELLEHER. Which means with a gun at their head. Now, the 
question was, ‘‘Well, we think that there is some merit to the posi-
tion.’’ This is what Mr. Cox just quoted to you. I’m sure that he just 
inadvertently omitted part of my testimony. I’m sure it was just an 
oversight.  I  understand  that.  It  happens  to  a  lot  of  people  many 
times when they testify. So, I forgive him. 

‘‘Well,  we  think  that  there  is  some  merit  to  the  position  that 
there is no city in the United States that has two full-fledged hubs 
competing  against  one  another  successfully.’’  Right?  That’s  what 
Mr. Cox quoted. 

Next  sentence,  that  he  omitted,  ‘‘There  are  cities  that  have  a 
main airport and satellite airports which live well in a complemen-
tary relationship, in a harmonious relationship.’’ And that is the re-
lationship  between  85-percent-controlled,  166-gate  DFW  Airport 
and  32-gate  Love  Field.  That’s  the  same  as  the  relationship  be-
tween Ohare Airport and Midway, in Chicago, which has been good 
for  Ohare,  the  same  as  the  relationship  between  Intercontinental 
Airport, in Houston, and Hobby, which has been good for Houston. 

That is my full testimony on that occasion, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator BURNS. Thank you. 
Now, I’m going to ask about three questions, and then I’m going 

to let somebody else ask questions, because I’m not a lawyer. 

Senator HUTCHISON. Mr. Chairman? 
Senator BURNS. And—yes? 
Senator HUTCHISON. Before you finish, I would like to put in the 
record  the  full  answer  to  the  question,  which  I  was  just  supplied, 
for the deposition, because there is even a further part of that, and 
I think we should just have the record clear all the way. 

Senator BURNS. OK. 
Mr. KELLEHER. I’d be delighted, Senator. Thank you. 
Senator BURNS. Without objection.

Senator  HUTCHISON.  OK.  And,  Mr.  Kelleher,  you  tell  me  if  I’m 

57 

reading wrong. 

After the part that you read, it goes on to say, ‘‘And we, too, have 
to agree, as a matter of logic and principle, that if you allowed Love 
Field  to  come  up  as  a  full-fledged  hub  in  opposition  to  DFW  Air-
port, that, indeed, air service to the Metroplex would suffer to some 
extent,  because,  basically,  a  hub-and-spoke  system  depends,  for  its 
success,  upon  attracting  passengers  from  a  multitude  of  spokes 
that will fill up an airplane going to another destination. If you di-
vide  that  type  of  operation  between  two  airports,  you’re  likely  to 
lose service to some of the smaller industries.’’ 

Mr. KELLEHER. That is—— 
Senator HUTCHISON. That would be the full—— 
Mr. KELLEHER.—that is correct, Senator. And, at that time, Love 
Field had twice as many gates as it has today, and DFW had a lot 
less gates than it has today. It’s now 166-to-32 insofar as gates are 
concerned.  And  what  I  said  then  is  true,  that  if  you  have  two  full- 
fledged hubs come up against one another, that will happen. We’re 
not  talking  about  a  full-fledged  hub  coming  up  against  DFW  Air-
port. We’re not even a hub-and-spoke carrier. 

Senator HUTCHISON. Would you—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. They only have 32 gates. 
Senator HUTCHISON. Thirty-two gates available. 
Mr. KELLEHER. Available at Love Field, correct. 
Senator HUTCHISON. As—of which how many are used? 
Mr. KELLEHER. Fourteen, as of the present time. 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  So,  you’re  talking  about  the  potential  dou-
bling  of  where  Love  Field  would  be  right  now  in  numbers  of  gates 
available. And I guess where we would have a—maybe a disagree-
ment is whether that could be a full-fledged hub airport if you dou-
ble what we have there now? 

Mr. KELLEHER. Well, I don’t think we can disagree on that, Sen-
ator,  if  we  look  at  other  areas  in  the  country  where  this  actually 
takes  place.  And  what  I’m  referring  to  is,  when  issues  of  this  sort 
come up, I normally try to go out, like with a scientific perspective, 
and  say,  well,  ‘‘Everybody’s  asking  about  all  this,  and  contending 
all  these  things,’’  and  I  understand  where  that  comes  from.  So,  I 
did a little look at Houston. Houston is smaller than the Metroplex 
of Dallas and Fort Worth, Number One. And, from 1979, when the 
Wright  Amendment  passed,  over  my  objection,  through  2004, 
Southwest  being  completely  unconstrained  at  Hobby  Airport  in 
Houston,  having  more  departures  from  Hobby  Airport  in  Houston 
than  it  has  from  Love  Field  in  Dallas,  during  that  time,  Conti-
nental, the most successful of the legacy carriers, which has its hub 
at  Intercontinental  Airport,  really  suffered  from  that  competition 
from  Southwest  Airlines.  And  I’ll  tell  you  how  much  Continental 
suffered.  Poor  old  Continental  having  its  hub  at  Intercontinental, 
having us serving Hobby, more flights than at Love Field. 

During  that  time,  Continental’s  Intercontinental  Airport  depar-
tures  only  increased  179  percent,  and  the  number  of  passengers 
carried  at  Intercontinental  grew  by  228  percent.  So,  if  you  have 
more  flights  at  lower  fares  from  Love  Field,  you  will  have  more 
passengers  at  lower  fares  at  DFW  Airport,  serving  the  whole

Metroplex and producing additional flights for DFW, too. That’s the 
way it works. 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Senator,  may  I  make  a  point  on  the  subject  of  the 

number of gates at Love Field? Why would we—if this is a—— 

Senator BURNS. Pull your mike up. Pull your—— 
Mr. ARPEY. I’m sorry. 
Senator BURNS.—mike up. 
Mr. ARPEY. If this is a discussion and debate about the free mar-
ket,  why  do  we  have  limits  on  the  number  of  gates  at  Love  Field? 
Why  would  we  restrict  Love  Field  to  32  gates?  And,  in  fact,  if  you 
look at the history of the Love Field master plan, the Master Plan 
Advisory  Committee  says  that,  ‘‘After  being  at  the  center  of  a  con-
troversy  for  many  years,  a  consensus  has  been  developed  to  guide 
the  future  of  Dallas  Love  Field.  The  proposed  Love  Field  master 
plan  was  forged  by  a  broad-based  group  of  local  residents,  neigh-
borhood and business leaders, general aviation tenants, airline rep-
resentatives, and others interested in the future of Love Field. The 
Wright-Shelby  Amendment  is  assumed  to  remain  intact.’’  That’s 
signed by Southwest Airlines. 

Mr. KELLEHER. May I respond to that? 
Senator BURNS. Wait a minute—— 
Mr. ARPEY. Southwest Airlines—— 
Senator  BURNS.—I  want  to  ask  my  question  before  I  have  to  go 

vote. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS. I’ve got some more questions here—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. Mr. Chairman? 
Senator  BURNS.—and  mine  are  fairly  pointed,  and  then  you  can 

argue with the Senator from Texas. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BURNS.  But  I  just  want  to  clear  out  a  couple  of  things 
that  I  think  is  important  to  this  Committee  and  whenever  you 
start talking about policy. 

Mr.  Arpey,  under  the  Eclats  study,  it  assumes  American  will 
split  its  operation  between  Love  and  DFW  if  the  Wright  Amend-
ment is repealed. 

Mr. ARPEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  BURNS.  It  doesn’t  seem  to  make  business  sense  to  split 
a hub operation like yours at DFW. If the Wright Amendment were 
repealed, do you really anticipate moving significant flights to Love 
Field? 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Yes,  sir.  Not  to  be  punitive,  but  because,  as  I  indi-
cated  in  my  testimony,  approximately  60  percent  of  our  local  cus-
tomers  live  closer  to  Love  Field  than  DFW  Airport.  So,  unless  we 
want  to  cede  the  geography  and  the  drive  time  and  territory  to 
Southwest,  of  course  we  will  split  our  operation.  That  will  not 
produce  a  good  result  for  our  company,  but  a  worse  result  would 
be produced if we sat there and did nothing. 

Senator  BURNS.  Well,  now,  you  didn’t  do  the  same  thing  at  Chi-

cago at Chicago O’Hare and Midway. 
Mr. ARPEY. We operate at Midway. 
Senator BURNS. OK. That’s fine. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS.—is the Wright Amendment——

Mr.  ARPEY.  And,  by  the  way,  Chicago  O’Hare  is  slot  controlled, 

59 

so there are capacity limits on—— 

Senator BURNS. Yes. 
Mr. ARPEY.—what we can do—— 
Senator BURNS. That is true. That is true. 
Mr. Kelleher, if the Wright Amendment were repealed and other 
carriers wished to serve Love Field, would Southwest be supportive 
of  reworking  the  Love  Field  master  plan  to  allow  competition 
there? 

Mr. KELLEHER. Well, you can—excuse me, Mr. Chairman—— 
Senator BURNS. Yes. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—I’m  not—and  I’m  not  going  to  deliver  you  a 
thumb sandwich when I say this, but obviously there is substantial 
room for competition at Love Field as of the present time, in terms 
of  the  numbers  of  available  gates.  Second,  the  reason  those  gates 
aren’t  utilized  is  because  of  the  Wright  Amendment,  because  the 
Wright  Amendment  would  not  permit  them  to  be  utilized,  because 
you can’t develop enough traffic to utilize them. 

And  it’s  kind  of  funny  that  people  would  say,  ‘‘This  is  a  local 
issue,  but,  hey,  wait  a  second,  we  came  to  Washington  to  get  the 
Wright  Amendment  passed.’’  I  guess  that’s  why  we’re  up  here  in 
Washington today. 

Senator BURNS. No, I meant—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. But—— 
Senator BURNS. OK, go ahead. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—Mr.  Chairman,  my  point  is  that  anybody  can 
come to Love Field that wants to who observes the Wright Amend-
ment. 

Senator BURNS. Well, but would you support the—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. There are—— 
Senator BURNS.—master plan—— 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—there  are  nine  additional  unused  gates—nine 
gates available at Love Field. Three, American has. They left them 
after they killed Legend at Love Field. And there are six gates that 
are  totally  vacant.  So,  they  have  nine  gates.  That  is  a  substantial 
proportion of the gates that are available for competition. 

And  we  don’t  support  changing  the  master  plan.  May  I  tell  you 

how the master plan came to be, Mr. Chairman? 

Senator BURNS. Well, I don’t care how it came to be. It is. 
Mr. KELLEHER. Well, it is, yes. 
Senator BURNS. Yes. 
Mr. KELLEHER. Yes. 
Senator BURNS. I guess the simple question would be, Would you 

support that master plan as written now? 

Mr. KELLEHER. Yes, I would support the master—— 
Senator BURNS. OK. 
Mr. KELLEHER.—plan, as written—— 
Senator BURNS. That’s—— 
Mr. KELLEHER.—now. 
Senator BURNS.—that’s fine. Now—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. Certainly.

Senator  BURNS.  And  then  I’m  going  to  move  on.  If  Love  Field 
was  closed  down,  could  DFW  absorb  all  of  Southwest’s  flights  and 
infrastructure needs? 

Mr. COX. In a heartbeat, sir. 
Senator BURNS. The Senator from Texas. 
Senator HUTCHISON. I want to talk about two things that I think 
are  important.  Number  One  is  the  service  that’s  now  given  to 
smaller cities by both American and Southwest. I very much worry 
that  if  we  allow  more  long-haul  service  out  of  Love  Field,  that 
much  of  the  service  to  many  communities  in  Texas  and  other 
States  could  be  lost.  For  instance,  I’ve  got  the  Southwest—this  is 
just  Southwest,  not  counting  what  American  does—but  Southwest 
has  31  flights  a  day  between  Love  Field  and  Houston,  19  to  San 
Antonio,  14  to  Harlingen,  14  to  Austin,  and  12  to  Albuquerque. 
And that’s a great service. 

I  am  very  concerned  that  if  there  are  long-haul  options  that 
smaller-city  service  is  going  to  be  denigrated.  And  I’d  like  to  have 
both  Mr.  Arpey  and  Mr.  Kelleher  respond  to:  What  kind  of  serv-
ice—either problems or enhancements, if that would be your case— 
would  you  see  to  smaller  places  that  even  some  of  which  are  now 
subsidized by the Federal Government? 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Senator,  I  think  I  would,  again,  echo  back  to  Herb’s 
testimony,  in  the  context  in  which  it  was  given.  I  think  Herb  ac-
knowledged  that  if  you  break  apart  a  hub  operation,  and  split  it 
between  two  airports,  you  begin  to  undermine  the  efficacy  of  the 
hub.  And  that  impacts  your  ability  to  add  service,  to  grow  service. 
And  while  we  would  not  be  inclined  to  do  that  under  normal  cir-
cumstances,  because  the  local  market  is  so  important  to  the  effi-
cacy of our current hub at DFW, if Love Field did come open, fully 
open,  we  can’t  sit  there  and  cede  all  of  the  New  York  traffic,  Cali-
fornia  traffic,  Florida  traffic,  local  traffic  to  an  airline  that  has 
shorter  drive  time  to  that  airport,  because  people  are  going  to  go 
to that airport. And when we make those decisions to split our op-
eration,  inevitably  service  to  smaller  communities  are  going  to  be 
in  the  crossfire,  because  we’re  going  to  be  looking  for  airplanes  to 
go in and build our service at Love Field. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Well,  in  a  sense,  you’re  in  the  same  situa-
tion—I  happen  to  have  Southwest’s  schedule,  but  you,  also,  do 
quite  a  bit  of  service  to  smaller  markets.  And  so,  the  question 
would be, for you, as well, Do you eliminate those, in favor of going 
to Love Field and going to New York and Los—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Yes, I think—— 
Senator HUTCHISON.—Angeles and—— 
Mr. ARPEY.—that will be part of the result if the Wright Amend-
ment is repealed. Because what we’ll do, quite frankly, is, we’ll look 
to  see  where  Southwest  operates  from  Love  Field  and  what  local 
markets  they  attack  in  the  DFW  area.  And  we  will  try  to  respond 
from  Love  Field.  I  think  the  simpler  answer  to  this  question  is  to 
just  have  Southwest  come  and  compete  from  DFW  like  everybody 
else.  And,  although  we  don’t  provide  any  warm  milk  or  graham 
crackers  for  them,  Kevin  Cox  has  given  them  a  lot  of  graham 
crackers and warm milk, much to my chagrin.

Mr. KELLEHER. I think that was to Gerard’s chagrin, because he 

wanted those 22 gates himself—— 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. KELLEHER.—and Kevin wouldn’t give them to him. 
But  as  far  as  small-city  service  is  concerned,  I  want  to  reassure 
you,  Senator,  completely,  because  I’ve  looked  at  the  record,  again, 
of what’s happened in Chicago, where you have O’Hare Airport and 
Midway Airport. Right? Same thing. One big, one small. And here’s 
what  happened  in  the  period  2000  through  2005.  During  that  pe-
riod,  we  were  expanding  at  Midway  Airport,  where  American,  I 
think, has two departures a day, maybe three. We were expanding 
at  that  airport.  And  we  have  a  lot  more  flights  there  than  we  do 
at Love Field. We have about 192, as of today. 

Now,  how  did  that  affect  small-city  service?  Isn’t  that  a  good 
question? Here’s the satellite airport expanding. Southwest Airlines 
is  doing  the  expansion.  That’s  what  we’re  talking  about,  I  think. 
And  how  did  it  affect  small-city  service  out  of  O’Hare?  Now,  this 
is  how  it  affected  it.  During  those  5  years,  American  Airlines  at 
O’Hare, its regional jet commuter service, went from 31 to 60 mar-
kets.  That’s  almost  a  100  percent  increase.  Its  departures  with  its 
regional jets went from 164 to 239, which is a 52 percent increase. 
And  its  seats  increased  by  4,700,  which  is  57  percent.  So,  local 
service  was  not  adversely  affected.  It  was  substantially  increased. 
So, that takes care of what happens in a situation where you have 
a  main  airport  and  a  satellite  airport  competing  against  one  an-
other. 

Second,  what  would  happen  with  respect  to  Southwest  Airlines? 
Well, you’re right, we do serve some very small cities, that is abso-
lutely correct—76, 109, 115, 118, 200—I mean, 125th in size in the 
country.  And  we  would  be  happy  to  continue  serving  those  cities 
and provide them with even more service subsequent to the repeal 
of the Wright Amendment. 

Why,  Senator?  Because,  first  of  all,  they’ll  be  able  to  get  lower 
fares  flying  to  a  lot  more  destinations.  That  means  more  pas-
sengers.  That  means  more  flights,  as  a  consequence  of  that.  And 
that’s been the case since Southwest Airlines started, in 1971. And 
the  interesting  thing  to  me  about  Mr.  Cox  is  that  he’s  an  airport 
guy,  but  he  knows  that  if  you  have  lower  fares  out  of  Love  Field, 
if you have lower fares out of DFW, which is the case today within 
the  Wright  Amendment,  and  you’ll  get  more  passengers  at  your 
airport, more parking concessions than you would otherwise.

STATEMENT OF HON. E. BENJAMIN NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA 

Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
to  the  witnesses  today,  to  this  panel.  It’s  obvious  that  not  only  is 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

the  knowledge  range  high,  but  the  passions  run  rather  deep,  as 
well.  So,  I  think  that  makes  it  a  fairly  challenging  issue  for  all  of 
us to try to sort through. 

Generally,  benefits  and  burdens  go  together,  and  it’s  always  a 
question  of:  If  somebody  gets  the  benefit,  does  somebody  else  get 
a burden? And if you’re going to have increased flights and reduced 
rates  as  a  result  of  the  competition,  let’s  say,  that  it  might  gen-
erate,  by  repealing  the  Wright  Amendment,  will  there  be  reduced 
service  and  increased  rates  in  other  locations?  Obviously,  New 
York,  Chicago,  St.  Louis,  the  major  destinations,  will  benefit.  And 
I  know  it’s  the  intent  to  be  able  to  serve  the  smaller  communities, 
as  well.  But  my  question,  once  I  think  about  it  nationally—I  have 
to  focus  locally,  as  well—does  Omaha  benefit?  So,  does  Nebraska 
and  Western  Iowa  benefit  from  any  kind  of  repeal  or  modification 
of  the  Wright  Amendment?  And  I  guess  I’d  ask  that  of  all  of  you, 
because I’m not just interested in putting Mr. Kelleher on the spot. 
I am interested—— 

Mr. KELLEHER. No, I’m not on the spot at all, Senator. 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  I  don’t  want  to  put  you  on  the  spot, 

either. I—— 

Mr. KELLEHER. No, I’m—— 
Senator BEN NELSON.—wanted to be—— 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—glad  you  asked  that  question,  because  certainly 
if  the  Wright  Amendment  were  repealed,  Omaha  would  get  a  lot 
lower fares into out of Texas, and there would be a lot more people 
flying  to  Omaha,  and  from  Omaha  to  Texas.  And  there’s  no  ques-
tion about that. I mean, that is the whole history of the airline in-
dustry since Southwest Airlines entered it and reformed it in 1971. 
So, it would be a big plus for Omaha. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Mr. Cox was shaking his head no—— 
[Laughter.] 
Senator BEN NELSON.—when you were answering, so perhaps he 

has another perspective. 

Mr.  COX.  Yes.  Our  perspective  is  one  that  has  been  articulated 
many  times.  And  we’ve  talked  about  Houston  as  a  good  example. 
Let’s  talk  about  Houston.  Houston  has  two  airports  that  compete 
against  each  other,  basically  on  the  same  population  base,  as  op-
posed  to  DFW  Airport,  built  with  the  large  major  facility,  allows 
everybody  to  compete  on  the  same  level  playing  field.  Today,  we 
have  more  destinations  out  of  DFW  Airport,  40  percent  more  pas-
sengers out of DFW Airport, than both Houston airports combined. 
The fact of the matter is, as you begin to divide the hub and der-
ogate  the  hub,  the  carriers  will  make  those  big  decisions  between 
flying  into  the  large-haul  markets  or  the  short-haul  markets  that 
tend  to  be  the  smaller  cities.  And  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  those 
small  cities  will  lose.  And  when  you  build,  as  every  major  airport 
in  every  community  in  the  last  50  years  has  made  the  decision,  a 
large  facility  where  everybody  can  compete  effectively  and  fairly, 
everybody wins. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Mr. Arpey? 
Mr. ARPEY. Senator, I would not disagree at all with Herb’s point 
about airline competition and its effect on ticket prices. And he cer-
tainly  has  led  the  way.  And,  as  I  said  in  my  remarks,  competition 
between  airlines  is  good  for  consumers,  it’s  good  for  communities, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

63 

and,  in  our  industry,  unfortunately,  not  so  good  for  airlines,  be-
cause  this  is  an  industry  prone  to  destructive  competition  because 
of its nature. 

So,  I  think  the  question  for  the  House  is,  what  is  the  guiding 
public-policy principle recognizing that airline competition is a good 
thing? And all we’re advocating is that when you have public policy 
laid  down  that  focuses  resources  on  one  airport  and  on  which  bil-
lions  of  dollars  have  been  invested,  you  shouldn’t  casually  under-
mine  that  public  policy  when  the  most  successful  airline  in  the 
United States can simply come and operate at that airport like ev-
eryone else. 

And  to  underscore  Kevin’s  point,  the  cities  that  do  concentrate 
their airline activity do generate more flights per capita than cities 
that  split  their  operation.  And  that  is  why,  as  has  been  indicated 
today,  Denver  dug  up  the  runways  when  they  built  the  new  air-
port.  And,  recently,  Herb  has  announced  they’re  going  to  fly  into 
DIA. And I suspect if Stapleton was still open, they wouldn’t be fly-
ing into DIA, they’d be trying to go into Stapleton. 

So, I think sound public policy suggests when communities come 
together  and  when  we  take  Federal  money  to  build  airports,  we 
should use that money wisely, particularly at a time when the gov-
ernment  is  struggling  for  resources.  Why  should  we  be  supporting 
two  airports,  two  TSA  infrastructures,  two  FAA  infrastructures, 
when  you  can  consolidate  it  at  one  airport  and  let  everyone  com-
pete on a level playing field. 

Senator BEN NELSON. My time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Chair-

man. Thank you. 

Senator BURNS. Senator Ensign. 
Senator ENSIGN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I’m  really  glad  we’re  having  this  discussion.  It’s  bringing  out— 
and  Senator  Hutchison  has  encouraged  me  to  listen  to  all  sides, 
which  I  have  done  very  carefully,  and  look  forward  to  the  rest  of 
the hearing. 

The  interchange  that  we  have  just  had,  just  now,  I  think  that  it 
is  important  to  look  at  history,  what  has  happened,  and  at  the 
facts, so that we don’t just have conjecture on what’s going to hap-
pen in the future. Because, obviously, if we have similar situations, 
I  think  that  that  can  portend  what  is  going  to  happen  in  the  fu-
ture. I think there can be a direct relationship there. 

So,  the  question  I  have  is  Chicago/Midway,  San  Francisco/Oak-
land. Obviously, we’ve mentioned the Houston/Intercontinental and 
Houston/Hobby.  We  have  Miami  competing  against  Fort  Lauder-
dale.  In  every  one  of  those  situations,  we  have  big  airports/little 
airports.  You  can  even  go  to  LAX  and—well,  there’s  several  re-
gional airports—— 

Senator BURNS. Orange County. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  Well,  there’s  Orange  County,  there’s  Bur-

bank—— 

Senator BURNS. Right. 
Senator  ENSIGN.—I  mean,  there’s  several  down  there  that  are 
smaller  airports.  In  your  study,  American  Airlines  study,  you  as-
sume  that  the  master  plan  at  Love  Field  is  going  to  be  changed. 
Where my piece of legislation says that it is not. We do not change 
the  master  plan.  That’s  something  locally  decided.  We  do  not

64 

change the master plan. So, your study assumes something that is 
different  from  what  the  legislation  and  the  repeal  of  the  Wright 
Amendment  is—or  at  least  from  my  perspective,  and  Senator 
McCain’s perspective—is foreseen. 

I  guess  the  question  would  be—and  all  three  of  you,  I’d  appre-
ciate it if you’d keep your answer as brief as possible—is, why can’t 
DFW  compete,  like  San  Francisco  competes  with  Oakland  and 
Miami  with  Fort  Lauderdale  and  Chicago  O’Hare  with  Midway? 
And  in  that,  Mr.  Arpey,  you  said  that  you  do  operate—in  answer 
to Senator Burns’ question—you do operate out of Midway, but you 
did not move your hub—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Right. 
Senator  ENSIGN.—to  Midway.  In  other  words,  you’re  not  going 

to—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  ENSIGN.—you  can’t  move  your  hub  to  Love  Field.  You 

may operate out of there—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Yes. 
Senator  ENSIGN.—and  you  may  go  to  certain  cities  and  things 
like  that,  but  you’re  not  going  to  move  your  hub  there.  And  so,  I 
think  it  was  a  little  disingenuous  to  suggest  that  that  would  hap-
pen. 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Well,  Senator,  with  all  due  respect,  I  don’t  think  I 
suggested we would move our hub from DFW to Love Field. I said 
we  will  take  some  number—some  percentage  of  our  operation  and 
go to Love Field and try to compete with Southwest, not—— 

Senator ENSIGN. Right. 
Mr. ARPEY.—not move the hub—— 
Senator ENSIGN. You’re still going to have your hub operation at 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Well,  but  the  point  we’re  making  is  that  our  hub 
would  be  diminished.  And  the  reason  that  we  presume  that  the 
master  plan  at  Love  Field  would  go  away  is  because  of  your  free- 
market  orientation.  I  don’t  know  how,  on  the  one  hand,  we  would 
be  arguing  about  opening  up  this  airport,  but,  on  the  other  hand, 
saying it needs to be restricted. It—— 

Senator ENSIGN. Well—— 
Mr. ARPEY.—seems to conflict—— 
Senator ENSIGN.—every local community has master plans. Oak-

Dallas—— 

land—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Right, and—— 
Senator ENSIGN.—didn’t open up—they have certain restrictions. 

United has a hub—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Right. 
Senator ENSIGN.—at San Francisco. 
Mr. ARPEY. And the cities of Dallas—— 
Senator  ENSIGN.  But  they  don’t  have  a  restriction  on  where—— 
Mr. ARPEY. Right. 
Senator ENSIGN.—they can fly. 
Mr.  ARPEY.  And  the  cities  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  came  to-
gether  and  said,  ‘‘We’re  going  to  close  our  regional  airports  and 
build  DFW  Airport,  and  all  airlines  will  operate  there.  And  the 
only reason that’s not happening today is because of——

Mr. ARPEY.—lawyering.

Mr. ARPEY. It is not past—— 
Senator ENSIGN.—what works—— 
Mr. ARPEY.—history. It’s current—— 
Senator ENSIGN.—and what doesn’t. 
Mr. ARPEY.—history. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  No.  Southwest  Airlines  won  that  argument  in 

the court. 

Mr. ARPEY. Right. 
Senator ENSIGN. The bottom line is, is that real situations today, 
why—when you’re—to make your arguments about what this legis-
lation—the effect that this legislation would have—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator ENSIGN. OK. We have examples out there that are argu-
ing  exactly  the  opposite  of  what  you  and  Mr.  Cox  are  arguing 
today. 

Mr. ARPEY. I don’t think so. I think Mr. Cox just got through ex-
plaining  to  you  that  because  of  the  concentration  of  resources  at 
Dallas/Fort  Worth,  DFW  Airport  has  overtaken  IAH,  in  terms  of 
per capita departures. Because it makes sense, from a public-policy 
standpoint,  to  concentrate  resources.  So,  all—the  only  point  I’m 
making is, not that DFW Airport’s going to disappear overnight or 
we’re going to move our hub to Love Field; it’s just going to impact 
us negatively. It’s going to diminish our DFW hub, and we’re going 
to  move  our  operation  over  there,  part  of  it,  after  having  invested 
billions  and  billions  of  dollars  in  infrastructure  on  one  set  of  as-
sumptions. I—— 

Senator ENSIGN. Mr. Kelleher? 
Mr.  KELLEHER.  Yes.  First  of  all,  you’re  completely  correct,  Sen-
ator, as I discussed earlier, in various situations in other cities, the 
main  airport  and  the  satellite  airport  flourish.  In—they’re  com-
plementary to one another. Certainly, Dallas would be no different 
from what has happened there. 

Second,  I’ve  heard  Gerard  say,  on  a  number  of  occasions,  that, 
you  know,  a  lot  of  their  most  frequent  flyers  live  close  to  Love 
Field,  and  that  would  give  the  impression,  perhaps  by  implication, 
that  DFW  Airport  was  located  somewhere  in  Antarctica.  In  actu-
ality,  DFW  Airport  is  12  miles  away  from  Love  Field.  All  the 
growth, since it opened, has been to the west side of the Metroplex. 
And  if  you’re  in  University  Park,  as  an  example,  and  if  you  want 
to  go  to  Love  Field,  it  might  take  you  10  or  12  minutes,  and  it 
might take you another 15 to get to DFW Airport. 

Now, what do you have at DFW Airport once you get there? Well, 
Mr.  Arpey  said,  last  week,  that,  through  its  code  shares  American 
serves  600  cities  and  135  countries.  Southwest  won’t  be  able  to  do 
that  out  of  Love  Field.  American  serves  the  globe.  Southwest  can’t 
do  that  out  of  Love  Field.  American  has  first-class  service.  South-
west does not. That won’t change. 

My point is that DFW is exceedingly competitive with Love Field. 
American  is  obviously  tremendously  competitive.  So,  its  proximity 
to  Love  Field  is  an  advantage  for  DFW,  because  it  can  compete

66 

very  much  against  Love  Field,  as  far  as  geographic  convenience  is 
concerned. 

Finally,  I’d  like  to  say  one  thing,  if  I  might,  and  that  is—may  I, 

Senator? 

Senator BURNS. Yes. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—about  public  policy,  the  comments  that  have 
been  made  with  respect  to  public  policy.  Yes,  this  was  one  heck  of 
a  public  policy  established  by  the  U.S.  Congress.  Jim  Wright—and 
I’m  not  knocking  Jim,  don’t  misunderstand  me—but  he  was  the 
Majority Leader of the House of Representatives. And do you think 
the  Wright  Amendment  would  have  ever  passed  if  that  were  not 
the  case?  Do  you  think  Congress  would  have  deregulated  the  air-
line  industry  in  1978,  and  then  said,  ‘‘Oh,  gee,  there’s  one  part  of 
it  that  we’d  like  to  re-regulate,  Love  Field?’’  So,  it  wasn’t  a  matter 
of public policy, it was a matter of political power that brought the 
Wright Amendment to pass. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  don’t  know  if  Mr.  Cox—obvi-
ously, my time is expired, but, you know, when the Shelby Amend-
ment—it  was  the  same  thing—when  the  Shelby  Amendment  was 
brought  up  a  few  years  ago,  DFW  testified,  at  the  time,  that  it 
would become a second-tier airport. And it’s pretty interesting that 
DFW definitely has not become a second-tier hub. So, I don’t know 
if you want to give Mr. Cox a chance—or we can do it on a second 
round. 

Senator BURNS. Senator—I’m sorry? 
Mr. COX. Could I quickly respond? 
Senator BURNS. You bet. 
Mr.  COX.  Sir,  there  are  really  three  basic  differences.  The  first 
is,  as  just  described,  there  are  not  two  other  airports  as  close  to-
gether as DFW and Love Field, 8 miles apart. So, when you’re talk-
ing  about  New  York  and  Los  Angeles  and  San  Francisco,  without 
question those airports are significantly farther apart. 

The second is, DFW has a population base of about, oh, four and 
a  half  million  people.  Los  Angeles,  a  much  larger  population  base. 
Chicago,  twice  that  population  base.  So,  they  can  support  those 
kind of complementary airports. 

The last, and probably one of the most important distinctions, in 
most of those airports where you have multiple airport authorities, 
you  have  the  ability  to  cross-subsidize.  So,  if  something  is  lost  at 
Chicago  Midway,  but  is  gained  at  Chicago  O’Hare,  a  dollar  lost  is 
a dollar gained. At DFW Airport, because it was supposed to be one 
airport,  we  have  one  airport  board  that  manages  that  asset.  If  a 
dollar  is  lost  at  DFW  Airport  to  Love  Field,  it  is  lost.  Under  the 
Federal rules, we cannot cross-subsidize. 

So, there are very significant distinctions between the three—for 
three  reasons,  between  those  airports  that  are  always  brought  up 
as, ‘‘They exist, and why can’t DFW coexist with Love Field?’’ 

Senator BURNS. Senator Pryor? 
I  want  to  get  through  this  first  panel,  you  know,  with  ques-
tioning.  We’ve  got  an  11:30  vote  that’s  two  votes,  and  then—and  I 
want to notify the Committee, I have never missed a meal, and, by 
gosh, I don’t plan—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS.—plan to.

Senator Pryor? 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Arpey, let me ask you a question, just a point of clarification. 
As  I  understand,  one  of  your  arguments  is  the  convenience  factor 
of having Love Field in near proximity, I guess, to quasi-downtown 
Dallas.  And  I  guess,  in  some  ways,  that’s  a  little  bit  like  the  Na-
tional  Airport/Dulles  Airport  situation  here.  I  think  what  you’re 
saying  is  that  there  are  factors  on  why  people  choose  one  airline 
over another. One is certainly price, but another is the convenience 
of  getting  to  the  airport.  Another  is  connections,  and  another  may 
be a frequent-flyer program or something like that. But is the Love 
Field/DFW  concern  that  you  have—at  least  in  part,  is  it  this  con-
venience  factor,  kind  of  like  National/Dulles?  People  here  tend  to 
favor National, just because it’s so much closer. 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Yes,  Senator.  And  I  agree  with  most  of  what  Herb 
said on this subject, that by the—as we say, by the crow flies, it’s, 
you  know,  10  miles,  12  miles,  but  if  you  actually  make  the  drive 
from  the  areas  surrounding  downtown  Dallas  and  Love  Field  to 
DFW Airport, it is considerably farther than driving to Love Field, 
so people aren’t going to want to make that drive. And that is why 
the communities came together 30 years ago to close those airports, 
so  that  DFW  could  be  successful.  Because  everyone  recognized  no-
body’s  going  to  drive  all  the  way  out  to—DFW,  30  years  ago,  was 
out  in  the  prairie,  and  no  one  was  going  to  drive  there  if  the  local 
airports remained open. And Herb’s right that the growth has been 
substantial  in  a  westerly  direction  since  DFW  Airport  has  been 
built, but, on the other hand, if you look—if you look at our traffic, 
the concentration of our passengers is still close to 60 percent clos-
er drive time to Love Field. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Let  me  ask  this,  also.  Is  another  concern  that 
you have with repealing the Wright Amendment the abruptness of 
the change? In other words, if we were to say we’re going to repeal 
the  Wright  Amendment  in  5  years,  would  that  give  you  guys  ade-
quate  time  to  do  your  planning  and  make  your  adjustments?  Or 
does the fundamental problem still remain? 

Mr.  ARPEY.  No,  I  think  that  doing  it  over  5  years  doesn’t  make 
any  sense,  because  we’ve  made  billions  of  dollars  of  investment  on 
the  presumption  that  the  Wright  Amendment  would  remain  in 
place forever. Now, perhaps that was a naive assumption, but, you 
know, I said in my testimony that Southwest’s position on this sub-
ject  had  been  neutral  for  many  years,  Herb  had  pledged  publicly 
he  would  not  seek  to  overturn  it,  and,  on  the  basis  of  the  agree-
ments between Dallas and Fort Worth, we made billion-dollar bets 
that  DFW  would  be  the  airport  for  long-haul  service.  And  so,  no, 
having it repealed over time is—does not comfort me one bit. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  I  believe  American  services  four  airports  in 
Arkansas.  You  serve,  of  course,  Little  Rock  and  Fayetteville  or 
XNA.  Those  are  our  two  largest  airports,  which,  by  airport  stand-

Fort Smith and Texarkana. Give me your read, or your impression 
of  what  would  happen  to  the  service  in  our  airports  in  Arkansas 
if  the  Wright  Amendment  were  repealed.  Fort  Smith  and  Tex-
arkana,  I  think  everyone  would  agree  are  small-market  airports. 
Little  Rock  and  Fayetteville  are  larger  airports.  But  what  is  your

read—if  we  lift  the  Wright  Amendment,  what  does  that  mean  to 
your ability to serve passengers in Arkansas? 

Mr. ARPEY. Well, Senator, I really have tried not to use scare tac-

tics as it relates to small cities. I’ve tried to—— 

Senator  PRYOR.  Yes,  I’m  not  asking  you  to  scare  us,  just  tell 

us—— 

Mr. ARPEY. No, but we—— 
Senator PRYOR.—your—— 
Mr. ARPEY.—we have talked about the fact that—— 
Senator PRYOR.—read. 
Mr. ARPEY.—if you diminish the efficacy of our hub at DFW, that 
has  implications  for  smaller  communities,  because  the  size—the 
bigger  and  more  robust  you  can  make  the  hub,  the  more  spokes 
you  can  add,  because  that  means,  for  many  of  these  small  cities, 
you  have  more  opportunities  to  sell  service.  So,  we’ve  made  the 
point,  and  it’s  confirmed  in  the  Eclat  study,  that  if  we—if  we’re 
compelled  to  split  our  operation  at  DFW,  I  think  that  does  put 
some  small  cities  at  jeopardy.  But,  we  don’t—I  don’t—in  sitting 
here  today,  it’s  not  clear  what  we’re  talking  about  at  Love 
Field—— 

Senator PRYOR. Right. 
Mr.  ARPEY.—because,  on  the  one  hand,  we’re  saying  we  want  a 
free  market,  and  we—in  the  spirit  of  a  free  market,  we  want  to 
open  up  Love  Field;  on  the  other  hand,  we  want  to  have  a  master 
plan  that  restricts  access.  So,  I  don’t  understand,  really,  where 
we’re going here. But—— 

Senator PRYOR. Mr. Kelleher—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. Could I answer—— 
Senator PRYOR.—let—— 
Mr. KELLEHER.—where we’re going? 
Senator  PRYOR.  Yes,  let  me  also  ask  you  a  question.  I  just  have 

a few seconds remaining. 
Mr. KELLEHER. Yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. This Thanksgiving, my family will travel back to 
Arkansas for Thanksgiving break on Southwest. There’s one direct 
flight  from  the  D.C.  area,  from  this  area,  to  Little  Rock,  and  that 
is on Southwest, through BWI. And I have that same concern about 
Southwest. If this change is made, would we maybe lose that direct 
flight to Little Rock because we might fly to Dallas more in a hub- 
and-spoke type approach and lose—I believe that flight goes to Lit-
tle  Rock  and  then  to  Las  Vegas,  that  direct  flight.  But,  anyway, 
would  we  lose  that  ability,  and  would  we  end  up  going  to  Dallas 
or some other type hub-and-spoke? So, I’d love to hear your—— 

Mr.  KELLEHER.  Well,  first  of  all,  you  wouldn’t  lose  that  flight.  It 
would  be  reinforced.  You  would  have  a  lot  more  passenger  traffic 
flowing  across  it  at  lower  fares  from  Dallas  Love  Field  to  Little 
Rock  and  on  to  BWI.  Second,  you  don’t  have  to  worry  about  the 
small  cities  being  abandoned,  because  they’re  the  most  profitable 
cities  that  the  legacy  carriers  serve.  They  don’t  have  a  lot  of  com-
petition, so they charge very high fares, and they get a lot of long- 
haul  passengers  they  can  take  around  the  world.  So,  they  have  a 
lot  of  investment  in  the  smaller  cities,  which  is  where  they  get 
their profit, rather than in the major cities.

But, beyond that, I just wanted to say that I’ve given two exam-
ples,  and  I  could  give  you  a  lot  more,  of  cities  that  have  a  major 
airport and a satellite airport. And small-community service hasn’t 
suffered. It’s increased. Hub service at the main airport hasn’t suf-
fered. It’s increased. 

And I guess one of the things I’d like to ask is, What is so special 
and  different  about  Love  Field  and  DFW,  except  the  fact  that  Jim 
Wright  was  the  Majority  Leader  and  represented  DFW  Airport  at 
the  time  the  airline  industry  was  deregulated?  That’s  my  basic 
question. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator BURNS. Senator McCain? 
Senator  MCCAIN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  know  we  have  a 

vote on, and I’ll try to be brief. 

You know, we have had an example of this same argument, and 
it  involved  the  perimeter  rule.  And  when  those  of  us  who  live  out-
side of the perimeter rule tried to have it lifted, because it’s an ar-
tificial  barrier,  an  arbitrary—again,  thanks  to  then-Speaker  of  the 
House, who I also happen to admire very much—that it stopped at 
the—no one could fly further west than the western end of the run-
way  at  Dallas/Fort  Worth  Field.  So,  anybody  who  wanted  to  go  on 
to Phoenix, Arizona, or Los Angeles or San Diego then had to stop 
and change airplanes. 

Now,  when  I  attempted,  not  only  for  my  citizens,  but  everyone 
who  lived  west  of  Dallas/Fort  Worth,  argued  this,  they  came  back 
with  the  same  arguments  you’re  hearing  now.  No  one  will  go  to 
Dulles  if  you  have  a  direct  flight  from  Reagan  to  LAX.  No  one 
wants  to  make  the  drive.  And  so,  therefore,  it  will  dry  up  Dulles 
Airport and BWI; that there will be a breakdown and an economic 
impact  on  Dallas/Fort  Worth—on  and  on  and  on.  The  fact  is,  all 
three  airports  are  doing  fine.  People  drive  to  Dulles  all  the  time. 
People  drive  to  BWI  all  the  time.  And  Reagan  is  full,  as  well. 
Only—well, we haven’t been able to repeal it completely, some peo-
ple  are  able,  on  occasion,  to  fly  directly,  and  not  have  to  stop  at 
the beautiful Dallas/Fort Worth Airport on their way west. And the 
same arguments were used against lifting the perimeter rule as are 
being  made  now.  It’s  all  about  free  markets  and  competition.  And 
I  believe  strongly  that  artificial  restraints  of  competition  that  are 
imposed by congressional decree are never a good idea. 

Mr. Arpey, you say that—you describe Southwest as exploiting a 
near  monopoly  at  Love  Field.  That  was  according  to  your  state-
ment.  Has  this  resulted  in  higher  ticket  prices  for  consumers  at 
Love Field? 

Mr. ARPEY. No. 
Senator MCCAIN. Would you consider controlling 84 percent of all 
flights  of  an  airport  a  near  monopoly,  as  well,  as  you  control  at 
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport? 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Well,  the  difference  is  the—between  Love  Field  and 
DFW—is  the  opportunity  and  the  availability  of  gates  and  real  es-
tate for anyone to come in and compete at DFW Airport. That same 
opportunity to the same degree doesn’t exist at Love Field. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  I  guess  I  have—you  know,  it’s  not  a  huge  part 
of  the  issue,  but  how—why  should  there  be  any  restrictions  on 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Southwest’s  ability  to  sell  through  tickets,  Mr.  Arpey?  How  do  you 
rationalize that one? 

Mr.  ARPEY.  Because  the  airports  were  supposed  to  be  closed  in 

their entirety. 

Senator MCCAIN. So, therefore—— 
Mr. ARPEY. There was a—— 
Senator  MCCAIN.—we  will  punish  them  when  they  are  open—— 
Mr. ARPEY. Not punishing them. 
Senator MCCAIN.—by not even allow them to—of course it’s pun-

ishment when you can’t purchase—— 

Mr. ARPEY. Well—— 
Senator MCCAIN.—a sell-through ticket. 
Mr. ARPEY. Well, Senator. 
Senator MCCAIN. Of course it’s punishment. 
Mr. ARPEY. Senator—— 
Senator MCCAIN. Every other airport in America, you can. 
Mr.  ARPEY.  Senator,  with  all  due  respect,  the  airport  was  sup-
posed  to  be  closed.  The  compromise  that  Southwest  agreed  to  al-
lowed  them  to  stay  at  Love  Field  with  restrictions,  or  else  the  air-
port  would  be  closed  and  they  would  be  competing  at  DFW  along 
with everybody else. 

Senator  MCCAIN.  Well,  I  know  that  Americans  need  to  fly  as 
cheaply as possible as they can. They are not able to do it without 
competition.  Study  after  study  has  shown  the  obvious,  that  the 
more competition there is, the lower the fares. 

Mr. Kelleher, I’d be glad to hear you speak. And, Mr. Chairman, 

I’ll then finish up. 

Go ahead, Mr. Kelleher. 
Mr. KELLEHER. Yes, sir. Well, I just wanted to say, Senator, that, 
obviously, the through-ticketing and marketing restrictions are un-
precedented.  You  never  had  that  at—you  never  had  that  in  Wash-
ington, at Reagan National Airport. You don’t have it at any other 
airport in America that I’m aware of. 

Senator MCCAIN. You might describe for the record what—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. But maybe—— 
Senator MCCAIN.—sell-through—what is a sell-through ticket re-

striction. 

Mr.  KELLEHER.  Well,  here’s—let  me  give  you  an  example  from 
Chairman Jerry Lewis from Southern California, because I used to 
fly  American  frequently  with  Congressman  Lewis  when  he  was  on 
his way home. 

Mr. ARPEY. Thank you, Herb. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.  It’s  a  pleasure.  I’m  a  big  customer  of 

Gerard’s—— 

Senator MCCAIN. Please go ahead. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.  But  here—let  me  give  you  an  example,  because 
it  is—it  is  difficult  for  people  to  comprehend.  I’m  trying  to  put  it 
in terms of an individual’s experience.

Senator MCCAIN.—the procedure you—— 
Mr. KELLEHER. But he flies—— 
Senator MCCAIN.—have to go through. 
Mr.  KELLEHER.—he  flies  to  DFW.  The  plane  stops  there.  It  goes 
on  to  Orange  County.  Right?  Under  the  Wright  Amendment,  Con-
gressman  Lewis  would  have  had  to  get  off  the  plane  at  DFW  Air-
port,  not  go  on  the  same  plane  to  Orange  County,  and  wait  for  a 
next connection, maybe 2, 3, 4 hours. That’s what that means with 
respect to through-ticketing. 

Senator MCCAIN. And that’s the case at Love Field today. 
Mr. KELLEHER. And that is the case at Love Field. 
Senator  MCCAIN.  Well,  I’m  sure  that  we  will  continue  to  discuss 
and  debate  this  issue,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  thank  you  for  having  this 
hearing.  And  I  thank  the  witnesses.  And,  Mr.  Cox,  I  don’t  know 
how much you paid the person to go back 15 years to find a state-
ment  by  Mr.  Kelleher’s,  but  if  I  had  to  stand  by  every  statement 
that  I  made  15  years  ago,  I  think  I’d  be  in  more  trouble  with  my 
constituents than I am. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator HUTCHISON. Or 15 days. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  BURNS.  I  know  17  years,  you  made  some  outrageous 

statement in——

Senator  BURNS.—Great  Falls,  Montana.  I’ve  got  to  dig  those  up. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS. Has the vote started? Anybody know? 
Senator HUTCHISON. Yes. 
Senator  BURNS.  I’ll  tell  you  what  we’re  going  to  do.  We’re  going 
to  go  vote.  We’ve  got  another  vote  in  back  of  that,  so  we  won’t  be 
back until—don’t plan on anything before 12 noon. And then we’re 
going  to  try  to  finish  up,  because  we’ve  all  got  things  to  do  this 
afternoon. Then we’ll try to finish. Do you have any more questions 
for this panel, or is it the next panel? 

Senator HUTCHISON. I’ll wait. I did, but I’ll wait. 
Senator BURNS. Well, can we get—— 
Senator HUTCHISON. Oh, no, we—— 
Senator BURNS.—can you—can we—can you get—— 
Senator HUTCHISON. Sure. 
Senator BURNS.—your questions out of the way now? 
Senator HUTCHISON. Mr. Cox—— 
Mr. COX. Yes, ma’am. 
Senator  HUTCHISON.—if  the  landing  fees  that  pay  for  DFW  Air-
port  were  not  adequate  for  debt  service,  what  would  happen  at 
DFW? 

Mr.  COX.  If  they  were  not  adequate  to  cover,  we’d  have  to  raise 
the prices, and it becomes a spiraling impact that we estimate our 
costs  could  go  upwards  100  percent,  and  it  becomes  very  difficult 
for  us  to  continue  to  attract  air  carriers.  We  have  bond  issues  out. 
We  have  35-year  bonds  that  are  dependent  upon  us  generating 
enough revenue upon which to pay our debt. 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you. 
Senator BURNS. Is that all you have——

up  front  that  it’s  an  issue  that  is  not  as  simple  as  it  appears  on

she said, ‘‘God bless the Marine Corps.’’ And that was Eleanor Roo-

The testimony that they give—I know a while ago we had the prin-

STATEMENT OF DAVID SAMUEL COATS, FORMER CHAIRMAN, 

NORTH DALLAS CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 

73 

Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
My name is Sam Coats, and, like Senator Hutchison, I’m former 
Chairman of the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce. I appreciate 
the opportunity to be here. 

The  Chamber  asked  me  to  come  today  because  I’ve  spent  most 
of  my  career  in  the  airline  industry,  both  pre-deregulation,  during 
deregulation,  and  subsequent  to  deregulation.  I  fought  Southwest 
Airlines and Herb Kelleher all during the 1970s. Maybe because he 
was  so  successful  in  beating  up  on  me,  he  hired  me  in  the  early 
1980s. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  COATS.  I  left  him  to  go  be  with  a  competitor,  as  president 
of a competitor, and he ended up buying that competitor. And, once 
again, he allowed me to resign. 

I  was  then  with  Braniff.  I’ve  been  with  Continental,  as  a  Senior 
Vice  President.  And  I  ran  an  Australian  domestic  airline  in  the 
early 1990s. The folks in Dallas say I can preach this thing around 
or flat, because I’ve been on all sides of the issue. 

The  thing  that  the  Chamber  is  interested  in  is  the  consumer. 
And we have taken the policy of this Nation to heart, and that has 
been  a  policy,  since  1978,  of  free  competition  and  airline  deregula-
tion.  And,  with  all  due  respect  to  Southwest  Airlines,  to  American 
Airlines,  and  to  DFW,  this  issue  has  been  improperly  framed  as  a 
debate  against—with  Southwest  on  one  side  and  DFW  and  Amer-
ican on the other side. 

American is the largest airline in the world, and one of the best. 
Its  annual  report,  which  is  over  a  hundred  pages  long,  gave  this 
issue two sentences in 2004, and that’s the 10K that they filed with 
the SEC. 

Southwest is the most profitable airline in history, has the long-

est record of profitability in history. 

DFW,  as  has  been  said,  is  the  second-largest  airport  and  one  of 

the greatest and busiest airports in the world. 

Mr. Chairman, this issue is not the tipping point for any of these 
parties.  This  is  a  consumer  issue,  not  a  Southwest  Airlines  issue, 
not a DFW issue, and not an American Airlines issue. 

American  Airlines  has  three  gates  at  DFW  that  they  could  use 
today  if  they  chose  to  do  so.  They’ve  been  in  and  out—or,  Love 
Field,  they’ve  been  in  and  out  of  Love  Field  on  several  occasions. 
The last, as it was mentioned, is when Legend was there, and they 
helped  Legend  become  another  set  of  bones  in  the  history  of  start-
up airlines. 

Southwest  looked  very  carefully  last  year  at  moving  to  DFW. 

They chose not to do so, after a lot of study and deliberation. 

We  respect  both  of  those  decisions.  These  guys  run  their  busi-
nesses  very  well.  They  are  astute  businesspeople.  They  would  kill 
you  in  a  heartbeat  if  they  had  the  chance,  as  competitors.  And 
that’s why they’re both very successful airlines. 

DFW,  it’s  almost  laughable  to  think  that  they  know  better  than 
the  people  who’ve  run  Southwest  Airlines  for  30  years,  plus,  that 
they  know  better  what  airports  Southwest  should  serve.  And  it  is 
somewhat  disingenuous  for  American  Airlines  to  invite  Southwest

to come into its fortress hub, that even Delta couldn’t compete suc-
cessfully  in,  and  retreated  from,  after  it  had  invested  hundreds  of 
millions  of  dollars.  I  think  I  heard  Herb  Kelleher  describe  that  as 
being  like  the  fly  who  had  been  invited  to  dinner  by  the  world’s 
largest spider. It just doesn’t hurt to have that happen. 

We  have  found—and  we,  at  the  Chamber,  believe  that  S.  1424 
should  be  enacted.  It  is  going  to  grow  the  pie  in  the  Dallas/Fort 
Worth area. This is the only vestige of regulation that is left. There 
is no other city in America with multiple airports that imposes the 
restrictions  on  one  of  the  airports  that  causes  it  to  be  treated  like 
a redheaded stepchild, while the other one is treated like—— 

Senator BURNS. You’re getting a little personal now. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. COATS. Yes, sir, I’m sorry. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. COATS. I should have changed that, Mr. Chairman. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. COATS. My wife always tells me I get in trouble. 
Senator BURNS. No, that’s fine. 
[Laughter.] 
Mr.  COATS.  We  believe  that  when  this  archaic  law  is  repealed— 
and  it  will  be—it  will  give  Dallas  the  opportunity  to  manage  this 
asset as it should. Dallas owns 70 percent, approximately, of DFW, 
and  100  percent  of  Love  Field.  I  know  the  Congress  would  like  to 
duck this issue completely. And we would like the Congress to duck 
it. But the constraint is not one that the city placed on Love Field, 
it’s  one  that  the  Congress  placed  on  Love  Field,  and  only  the  Con-
gress can remove that constraint. 

So,  we’re  asking  that  S.  1424  be  enacted.  And  we  have  also  of-
fered up that compromise that Herb Kelleher alluded to this morn-
ing.  We  would  suggest  that  over  the  next  2  to  5  years,  the 
ticketing—the  through-ticketing,  through-baggage,  through-mar-
keting  be  immediately  repealed,  and  that  then,  in  the  2  to  5  year 
period,  the  rest  of  the  Wright  Amendment  be  repealed,  so  that  ev-
erybody  can  adjust,  nobody  has  to  declare  defeat,  and  nobody  gets 
to declare victory. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID SAMUEL COATS, FORMER CHAIRMAN, 

NORTH DALLAS CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 

Mr. Chairman and Members: 
My  name  is  Sam  Coats.  I  am  here  today  on  behalf  of  the  North  Dallas  Chamber 
of  Commerce,  where,  like  my  long  time  friend,  Senator  Hutchison,  I  am  a  former 
Chairman. Thank you for this opportunity. The Chamber asked me to appear today 
because  I  have  spent  much  of  my  career  in  the  airline  industry  and  have  been  on 
both  sides  of  the  Wright  Amendment  debate.  I  started  my  career  as  General  Coun-
sel  of  Texas  International  Airlines  and  fought  Southwest  throughout  much  of  the 
1970s.  I  was  then  a  Senior  Officer  at  Braniff  and  later  served  two  years  as  a  Vice 
President  at  Southwest.  I  left  Southwest  to  become  President  of  Muse  Air.  South-
west  bought  Muse  in  1985.  I  have  also  served  as  CEO  of  an  Australian  domestic 
airline, and was a Senior Vice President at Continental Airlines during its dramatic 
financial turnaround. As some of my friends have said, when it comes to the Wright 
Amendment, ‘‘I can preach it round or flat.’’ 

I  entered  the  airline  industry  prior  to  deregulation.  I  saw  the  adjustments  and 
difficulties  that  many  carriers  experienced  in  its  aftermath.  I  have  also  witnessed 
the enormous benefits to the American people and to our economy that deregulation

and  open  airline  competition  have  brought  about.  The  artificial  restraints  of  the 
Wright Amendment are totally inconsistent with the policy of economic deregulation 
and open airline competition. 

You  have  heard  the  testimony  of  Southwest  Airlines,  American  Airlines,  and  the 
DFW  Airport.  With  all  due  respect  to  those  parties,  we  believe  that  it  is  wrong  to 
articulate the debate about repeal of the Wright Amendment in terms of a fight be-
tween Southwest Airlines on one side and American Airlines and DFW on the other. 
American is the world’s largest airline and one of the best. Southwest has the long-
est  record  of  consistent  profitability  of  any  airline  in  history.  DFW  is  the  Nation’s 
third  busiest  airport  and  one  of  the  largest  and  busiest  airports  in  the  world.  It  is 
a great airport. Its fortunes do not depend on the continued existence of the Wright 
Amendment. If it were that fragile it could not have sold and retired and again sold 
billions  of  dollars  in  airport  bonds  to  finance  its  growth  during  the  past  30  years. 
Repeal of the Wright Amendment will not be the tipping point for DFW, Southwest, 
or  American  Airlines.  In  American’s  own  hundred-plus  page  2004  Annual  Report 
and  Form  10K  filed  earlier  this  year,  the  issue  of  the  Wright  Amendment  got  just 
two sentences of discussion. American and Southwest are both very well run compa-
nies. They are fierce competitors. They make good business decisions based on care-
ful  analysis.  They  can  take  care  of  themselves  and  they  have  the  resources  to  do 
so. 

American  has  moved  into  and  out  of  Love  Field  on  several  occasions,  the  last 
being when they took on Legend Airlines and helped it become another set of bones 
in  the  graveyard  of  failed  startup  airlines.  At  present,  American  has  three  unused 
gates at Love Field that it ceased using after Legend went bankrupt. It can resume 
using those gates anytime it elects to do so. That they remain vacant indicates that 
American believes it is better to deploy its resources in the Dallas/Fort Worth region 
at  DFW.  We  at  the  North  Dallas  Chamber  understand  and  respect  that  decision. 
In a similar vein, Southwest recently looked at moving a portion of its operations 
to DFW. After much study and analysis, it chose not to do so. We respect that deci-
sion as well. Southwest has done a pretty good job of running its business for more 
than 30 years. 

It  is  clearly  disingenuous  for  American  to  continue  to  invite  Southwest  to  move 
its  operations  from  Love  Field  to  DFW.  Southwest  has  made  an  enormous  invest-
ment  in  its  headquarters  and  infrastructure  at  Love  Field  during  the  past  30-plus 
years.  We  believe  Mr.  Kelleher  described  it  well  when  he  said  that  he  felt  like  the 
fly  who  was  constantly  being  invited  to  dinner  by  the  world’s  largest  spider.  Like-
wise, it is laughable and absurd for officials at DFW to insist that they know better 
than Southwest’s own management what airport choices it should make. 

Repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  is  a  consumer  issue,  not  an  American  or  South-
west issue. The North Dallas Chamber of Commerce believes that its repeal will re-
move  the  final  major  government  imposed,  anticompetitive  barrier  to  airline  com-
petition  that  no  other  city  or  airport  in  the  United  States  has  to  tolerate.  It  will 
allow  any  airline  that  chooses  to  do  so  to  serve  Love  Field  as  it  would  any  other 
airport.  It  will  bring  lower  fares  and  greater  choices  to  consumers  traveling  to  or 
from  both  Love  Field  and  DFW.  Those  benefits  will  stimulate  economic  growth 
throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. They will also extend to consumers in 
Arizona,  Oregon,  Florida,  California,  Nevada,  and  every  other  state  going  forward. 
The City of Dallas owns almost 70 percent of the DFW Airport and controls seven 
of  eleven  board  seats.  It  owns  100  percent  of  Love  Field.  Dallas,  not  the  Congress 
should  determine  the  highest  and  best  uses  for  Love  Field.  The  Love  Field  Master 
Plan  is  in  place.  It  is  the  product  of  much  work  and  contributions  from  many  di-
verse  constituencies.  It  places  practical  limits  on  growth  and  respects  the  airport’s 
neighbors.  We  believe  it  should  be  followed,  unburdened  by  the  artificial  restraints 
of the Wright Amendment. We know of no other case where a city with two precious 
airport  assets  like  DFW  and  Love  Field  has  been  required  by  Congressional  man-
date to treat one like a prince and the other like a red-headed step child. 

The  North  Dallas  Chamber  of  Commerce  strongly  supports  the  goals  of  S.  1424. 
We believe that repeal of the Wright Amendment will end the uncertainty that has 
surrounded both DFW and Love Field for years. It will also allow the City of Dallas 
to  better  manage  Love  Field  in  accordance  with  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan.  Most 
importantly,  it  will  bring  about  lower  fares,  new  competition  and  traffic  growth  at 
both  DFW  and  Love  Field.  It  advances  the  policy  of  airline  deregulation.  While  the 
Chamber  would  welcome  immediate  repeal  of  this  archaic  and  anticompetitive  law, 
we  have  also  suggested  a  compromise  solution.  To  that  end  we  propose  that  the 
Wright Amendment be phased out in stages during the next two-to-five years. This 
would  achieve  our  ultimate  goal  and  also  insure  that  there  was  an  orderly  adapta-
tion to the effects of the repeal.

If  Congress  were  to  choose  this  approach,  we  believe  the  first  step  should  be  the 
immediate  removal  of  the  marketing,  through  ticketing,  and  checked  baggage  re-
strictions  that  the  Wright  Amendment  presently  imposes  on  any  airline  serving 
Love  Field.  These  provisions  harm  millions  of  air  travelers  each  year  and  serve  no 
purpose other than to artificially constrain competition. 

Thank  you  for  your  time  and  your  courtesy.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  ques-

tions you may have. 

Senator  BURNS.  Thank  you.  And  thank  you  for  your  statement. 
Now  we  have  Ms.  Lori  Palmer,  Love  Field  Citizens  Action  Com-
mittee.  And  thank  you  for  coming  today  and  offering  your  testi-
mony. 

STATEMENT OF LORI PALMER, 

LOVE FIELD CITIZENS ACTION COMMITTEE 

Ms.  PALMER.  Chairman  Burns,  thank  you  very  much  for,  first  of 
all,  having  this  hearing,  and  we  certainly  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity to be here. 

My  name  is  Lori  Palmer,  and  I  am  here  on  behalf  of  the  Love 
Field  Citizens  Action  Committee.  And  we  are  a  coalition  of  neigh-
borhoods  and  individuals  who  live  in  the  communities  that  are  af-
fected by the operations at Dallas Love Field. 

We’re  a  grassroots  organization.  We’re  homeowners  and  other 
dwellers,  some  businesses,  as  well.  And  I  think,  on  that  note,  just 
for  the  record,  I  am  proud  to  be  able  to  say  that  I  am  here,  and 
five  other  members  of  our  organization’s  Board  of  Directors  are 
here, and we are here because homeowners have raised the money 
to send us here. 

I  might  also  say  that  we  have  been  in  this  fight  for  a  long,  long 
time.  We  have  about  25  years  of  experience.  We  were  actually  es-
tablished  in  1980.  And,  on  a  somewhat  light  note,  I  met  Mr. 
Kelleher in 1981. I met Sam, here, somewhere in that time period. 
And I am absolutely convinced—— 

Mr. COATS. 1982. 
Ms.  PALMER.—that,  after  25  years  of  knowing  these  gentlemen, 

we are all going to end up in the same nursing home together. 

[Laughter.] 
Ms.  PALMER.  The  Love  Field  Citizens  Action  Committee  has  a 
mission,  and  it’s  a  really  very  important  and  critical  one,  and  one 
that  I  think  you  can  assume  that  a  grassroots  coalition  of  people 
would  have  around  an  airport.  And  that  is  to  reduce  noise,  to  re-
duce air pollution, to reduce traffic congestion and safety risks from 
this airport. 

And  we’ve  worked  on  a  lot  of  fronts.  I’m  not  going  to  describe 
them  all  to  you.  I’m  not  here  to  do  that  today.  But  there  are  two 
that  are  in  particularly—are  important  to  us.  One  is  the  Noise 
Abatement Program at Dallas Love Field, which was established in 
the  early  1980s  and  is  still  alive  and  well.  Voluntary.  Because  it 
is  not  possible,  through  Federal  regulation,  to  restrict  noise.  I 
wasn’t  quite  sure  how  Congressman  Hensarling  had  come  to  that 
conclusion,  because,  clearly,  if  there  were,  we  would  have  tried  to 
get them in place. 

We  have  been  very  instrumental  in  the  master  plan.  And,  a  lot 
today  was  said  about  the  master  plan.  And  I  am,  in  part,  here  to 
set  the  record  straight,  because  there  were  some  comments  that

were  made  that  were  curious  to  me,  and  I  think  we  just  want  to 
make sure that the facts come out. 

Let me also say that I was the founding president of this organi-
zation. I served on the Dallas City Council for 8 years. The airport 
was  in  my  district.  And  most  of  the  neighborhoods  affected  by  the 
airport  were  in  my  district.  So,  I’m  delighted  to  be  here  to  give 
some history. 

I  want  to  make  sure  everybody  understands  this  airport.  It’s 
small. It’s 130 acres. It has no clear zones, in the event of an emer-
gency on takeoff or landing. The neighborhoods, the park, a veteri-
nary  clinic,  schools  come  right  up  to  the  perimeter  of  the  airport. 
Now, in our statement, which we have submitted for the record, we 
have  very  good  graphics  that  show  this.  There’s  DFW,  designed  to 
be  a  regional  national/international  airport,  with  extensive  clear 
zones around it as buffers and also as safety margins. Dallas Love 
Field has none. 

The  neighborhoods  are  from  the  north,  the  west,  the  east,  and 
the south. And, like any neighborhoods, they are full of single-fam-
ily homes, apartments, parks, schools, churches, recreation centers, 
libraries, and small retail businesses. We’re right there. 

We  are  about  100,000  people  who  live  in  the  noise-impact  area. 
And  we  are  meaningful,  in  terms  of  the  value  of  our  property  and 
our  investment.  In  the  year  2000—and  it  would  have  grown  since 
then—let  me  describe  that  to  you  a  little  bit  more  specifically.  It 
was  estimated  then  that  the  market  value  of  residential  prop-
erties—I’m  not  talking  about  business  properties  now,  I’m  talking 
about residential properties—in the impact area was $5.3 billion in 
the  year  2000.  The  taxable  value  was  $3.9  billion.  And  the  annual 
tax contribution was $95.6 million. 

And I want to give you a little bit of a citizen’s view on the 1968 
bond  ordinance  in  the  opening  of  DFW  Airport.  What  we’ve  heard 
from,  so  far—and  it  was  a  fascinating  emotional  presentation  by 
Mr.  Kelleher;  normally  neighborhood  activists  are  considered  emo-
tional, but that was one of the more emotional presentations I had 
ever seen—the citizens have, equally, a strong memory about what 
happened. 

In  1968,  there  was  an  agreement,  and  there  was  a  deal.  Noise 
levels  in  the  late  1960s  had  become  onerous  at  Love  Field.  Fifty- 
five  gates  sending  planes  in  and  out  every  day.  People  were  con-
templating  leaving  the  area,  moving  out,  buying  a  home  some-
where  else,  outside  of  Dallas.  Others  were  hesitant  to  move  into 
the  neighborhoods.  When  that  1968  bond  ordinance  was  passed, 
Mr.  Chairman,  people  thought,  ‘‘There’s  hope  on  the  way.’’  They 
kept their houses, and they bought houses. We were told that there 
would be no air carriers at Love Field. 

In  1974,  it  is  true,  all  the  certificated  air  carriers  moved  out  to 
DFW,  but  one  did  not—Southwest  Airlines—and  we  were  very  un-
happy  about  that.  But  from  the  beginning,  traveling  to  Austin  or 
Houston,  not  much  noise,  not  much  problem.  However,  that 
changed.  As  Southwest  grew  its  intrastate  service  in  the  1960s, 
noise became a problem again, and we were not happy about that. 
That had not been what we had been told would happen. 

Then,  when  Southwest  Airlines  chose  to  go  to  New  Orleans  and 
interstate  service,  that  was  a  whole  new  ball  game.  And  when  the

Wright  Amendment  was  finally  enacted  into  law  in  1980,  we  were 
astonished. We felt betrayed, and we were angry. 

Now,  the  Wright  Amendment,  interestingly,  over  time  became  a 
critically  important  component  of  our  Noise  Abatement  Program, 
because  it  limits  service  to  short-haul  markets.  It  worked.  It  still 
does work. 

In  addition  to  that,  it  did  niche  Love  Field  to  be  a  short-haul 
service airport. These airports are 8 miles apart. When I heard the 
discussion this morning comparing our two airports, 8 miles apart, 
with  airports  in  other  major  metropolitan  areas  across  the  Nation, 
I  was  astonished  at  the  fact  that  no  one  understands  what  that 
means.  Intersecting  airspace.  Some  real  challenges  for  the  air  con-
trollers. We have other small airports in the region. It’s a very dif-
ficult airspace to manage. Eight miles apart. 

Now, let’s talk about the master plan. The master plan was com-
missioned  by  the  city  of  Dallas  in  order  to  come  up  with  a  future 
scenario  that  would  work  for  Love  Field.  After  3  decades  of  public 
conflict—3  decades  of  public  conflict—stakeholders  joined  together, 
about  30  of  them—all  the  airlines,  the  key  businesses,  the  North 
Dallas Chamber of Commerce, the neighborhoods—and, for quite a 
period  of  time,  under  the  guidance  of  DMJM,  the  consultant  com-
missioned by the city of Dallas, we built a plan. 

Now, the assumptions of that plan, the forecasts of that plan, the 
conclusions  of  that  plan,  and  the  recommendations  of  that  plan 
were all based on the Wright Amendment staying in place. 

So,  for  example,  32  gates  was  determined  to  be  a  rational  max-
imum  of  gates  at  the  airport.  There  would  be  growth  to  other  des-
tinations—regional jets. Regional jets could take people from Dallas 
Love  Field  to  any  destination  they  wanted  to,  in  this  country  or 
somewhere else. 

Now,  who  signed  off  on  this  plan?  Everybody  signed  off  on  this 
plan.  In  fact,  there  is  a  letter.  It’s  an  important  letter.  It’s  a  con-
sensus  letter.  It  went  to  the  City  Council  of  Dallas.  And,  but  for 
this letter, the city of Dallas would never have adopted this master 
plan.  The  letter  is  signed  by  some  30  people.  And,  in  the  letter,  it 
says, ‘‘It’s assumed that the Wright Amendment will stay in place, 
and  we  support  this  plan.’’  And  Bob  Montgomery,  Corporate  Vice 
President of Southwest Airlines, is the first signature on the letter. 

Senator BURNS. Do you want to round up here pretty quick? 
Ms. PALMER. Yes, sir. 
Senator  BURNS.  We’re  going  to  lose  those  other  two  down  there. 
Ms. PALMER. Yes, sir. 
This is not about low fares. Two years after the master plan was 
approved,  Southwest  Airlines  declared  its  assault  on  the  Wright 
Amendment. We were astonished. We were betrayed. And we were 
very  sad  about  that.  There  is  no  longer  a  consensus.  The  master 
plan,  without  the  Wright  Amendment,  would  become  a  hollow  and 
irrelevant  document.  The  32-gate  limit,  which  gave  some  protec-
tion, in theory and in reality, would be blown apart. 

Southwest Airlines controls 21 of the 32 gates. Another 6 of those 
gates, Mr. Chairman, are in a terminal on the other side of the air-
port.  Now,  that  leaves  five  gates  remaining  for  other  airlines.  No 
wonder Southwest Airlines would support the Wright—support the 
repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  and  keeping  the  32  gates.  They

have a strong monopoly at this airport. One hundred percent of the 
market  share,  maybe  95  or  96  percent  of  the  market  share.  There 
are advantages to staying at this airport, and they know it. There’s 
no  PFC.  The  landing  fees  are  the  second-lowest  of  all  the  airports 
that Southwest flies into. The rate structure for landing fees is two 
decades old. Last year, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s downgraded 
Love  Field  Airport,  because,  among  many  other  things,  its  pricing 
practices caused it to operate at a deficit and draw money from the 
capital construction fund to pay for maintenance and operations at 
the airport. 

So, Southwest Airlines has a really good deal at Love Field. Con-

trols the gates. Doesn’t have to pay much money. 

Now,  if  this  were,  in  fact,  about  low  fares,  Southwest  Airlines 
could  benefit  more  people,  with  low  fares,  out  of  DFW.  But  that  is 
not the case here, sir. 

In  summary,  their  whole—regardless  of  the  ‘‘Set  Love  Free’’ 
mantra—is  to  expand/strengthen  their  monopoly  at  Love  Field, 
and,  in  doing  so,  discourage,  or  even  prevent,  their  own  low-cost 
competitors from either growing or moving into DFW Airport. 

So,  in  summary,  let  me  say  that  the  Wright  Amendment  needs 
to stay in place, as is. It is not useless. It is very useful. It creates 
a  balance—Senator  Hutchison  is  very  aware  of  this—it  creates  a 
balance between the operations of Love Field and its impact on the 
neighborhoods. It creates a balance between a short-haul facility in 
Dallas and a long-haul facility, eight miles away, at DFW. It is, in 
fact, a relevant, useful tool. It’s fair. It is balanced. And, you know, 
Southwest  Airlines  has  two  options.  It  can  fly  regional  jets  any-
where  that  it  wants  out  of  Love  Field.  It  can  go  to  DFW.  But,  in-
stead, what it really wants to do is ask you all to legislate its busi-
ness plan. 

Thank you for the opportunity to speak. 
[The prepared statement of Ms. Palmer follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LORI PALMER, LOVE FIELD CITIZENS ACTION COMMITTEE 
On behalf of the Love Field Citizens Action Committee, I want to express my ap-
preciation  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  before  the  Senate  Aviation  Sub-
committee  on  current  efforts  to  repeal  the  ‘‘Wright  Amendment’’  at  Dallas  Love 
Field in Dallas, Texas. 
Love  Field  Citizens  Action  Committee  has  25  Years  of  Experience  With 

Dallas Love Field 

The Love Field Citizens Action Committee (LFCAC) is a coalition of residents and 
neighborhoods  in  the  Love  Field  impact  area.  The  organization  was  established  in 
1980 to address the airport’s adverse environmental impact on the large and densely 
populated community that surrounds the facility to the north, south, east and west. 
LFCAC’s  mission  is  to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  in  Love  Field  area  neighborhoods 
by  reducing  negative  noise  and  air  pollution,  traffic  congestion,  and  safety  risks 
posed by aircraft operations at Dallas Love Field. 

Over the last two and a half decades, LFCAC has been actively involved in many 
Love  Field  issues.  Its  first  major  accomplishment  was  the  adoption  of  Dallas  Love 
Field’s  first  noise  control  program,  approved  by  the  Dallas  City  Council  in  1981, 
when citizens filled the Council chambers to demonstrate their strong dissatisfaction 
with  increasing  airport  noise.  During  the  subsequent  24  years,  the  citizens’  organi-
zation  has  worked  on  many  fronts  to  try  to  create  a  balance  between  the  interests 
of the airport and interests of the densely populated community surrounding it. 

During  these  two  and  a  half  decades,  the  Love  Field  Citizens  Action  Committee 
(LFCAC)  has  developed  a  solid  understanding  of  Love  Field’s  operations  and  their 
impact  on  the  environment.  It  has  participated  in  23  years  worth  of  Noise  Abate-
ment  Advisory  Committee  meetings  at  Dallas  Love  Field,  researched  and  rec-

ommended  municipal  ordinances  to  address  noise  impact,  visited  with  elected  offi-
cials at the local and national levels, testified before the U.S. House of Representa-
tives  Subcommittee  on  Aviation  (1991),  submitted  legal  briefs  to  State  and  Federal 
courts  and  promoted  a  series  of  voluntary  noise  abatement  procedures  at  the  inner 
city  airport  including  one  of  the  earliest  and  most  comprehensive  noise  monitoring 
systems in the country. Most recently, the LFCAC actively participated in the devel-
opment  of  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan,  approved  unanimously  by  the  Dallas  City 
Council in April 2002 and by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
Dallas  Love  Field  Operations  Impact  Large  Area  in  Population  and  Value 
According  to  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan,  the  Noise  Impact  Area  of  the  Dallas 
Love is 25.4 square miles. The estimated population was 89,307 in the year 2000— 
a population figure that has, undoubtedly, grown in the five years since then. What 
do we know about the value of residential properties within the 55 DNL or greater 
Love  Field  Noise  Impact  Area?  Again,  according  to  the  Love  Field  Master  plan,  in 
the year 2000, the estimated market value of the residential properties was $5.3 bil-
lion.  The  taxable  value  of  all  residential  properties  was  approximately  $3.9  billion 
and  the  total  annual  property  tax  contributions  from  those  residential  properties 
was  $95.6  million.  Undoubtedly,  these  values  have  increased  as  well  since  the  year 
2000. 

Dallas Love Field is an inner-city airport located on only 1,300 acres. Densely pop-
ulated  residential  communities  with  single-family  homes,  apartments,  schools, 
parks,  recreation  centers,  libraries  and  retail  businesses  surround  it  on  all  sides. 
Planes that take off and land at Dallas Love Field must fly over neighborhoods that 
are homes to thousands of residents. The airport is locked in on all sides by single- 
family homes, churches, parks, schools, apartments, and retail businesses. There are 
no ‘‘clear zones’’ in the event of an emergency on take off or landing. 

As  an  example,  near  Love  Field,  less  than  a  mile  off  the  end  of  Runway  13R, 
there is a school named T.J. Rusk Middle School. Each school day, its 690 students 
and 45 teachers attend class while over 100 Southwest flights take off or land over-
head,  so  far  without  incident.  Across  the  street  from  T.J.  Rusk  is  a  day  school  and 
200 yards away is Maple Lawn Elementary School with 829 students and 50 teach-
ers. These children and teachers occupy classrooms just below what pilots call short 
final,  which  means  less  than  one  minute  from  landing  at  an  altitude  of  300  feet. 
Going the other way, on takeoff, these children and their teachers are directly below 
the planes as the landing gear is retracting. There are four ways to take off or land 
at Love Field. All of them impact neighborhoods. 
History of the Wright Amendment—A Community Perspective 

In  1968,  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  adopted  the  1968  Regional  Airport  Concurrent 
Bond  Ordinance  that  called  for  the  eventual  phase-out  of  certificated  air  carrier 
services  at  Love  Field.  Homeowners  and  others  began  to  anticipate  the  eventual 
change  at  the  airport,  looking  forward  to  a  future  time  when  all  air  carriers  would 
move  to  the  new  regional  airport.  As  a  result  of  the  bond  ordinance’s  adoption  by 
the two cities, many residents made the decision to stay in their homes rather than 
move  away.  Other  residents  made  the  decision  to  move  into  the  neighborhoods  and 
buy  homes.  They  too  believed  that  all  air  carrier  operations  would  move  to  DFW 
Regional Airport. They felt secure about the future. 

When the new DFW Airport opened in early 1974, all air carriers but one moved 
to the new airport. Southwest Airlines had managed to stay at the inner city airport 
due  to  its  intrastate  status  with  flights  to  Houston  and  Austin.  Although  residents 
expressed concern that the intent of consolidating all air carrier operations at DFW 
Airport had not yet occurred, the issue of noise was not serious because the number 
of daily takeoffs and landings was small during the first few years as SWA flew its 
intrastate routes. 

Gradually, however, the number of SWA’s daily operations increased, as did their 
noise  impact  on  Dallas  neighborhoods  surrounding  Love  Field.  Not  only  did  the 
number  of  operations  and  noise  increase,  so  did  the  level  of  alarm  on  the  part  of 
residents  who  had  been  told  that  air  carrier  traffic  at  the  airport  would  become  a 
thing of the past. Residents’ concern grew stronger in 1979 when SWA started inter-
state service to New Orleans. Residents felt angry and betrayed. 

When  the  Wright  Amendment  was  enacted  into  law  in  early  1980,  permitting 
interstate  traffic  to  the  four  states  adjacent  to  Texas,  it  translated  into  additional 
take-offs and landings over homes, schools, churches, parks, and nearby businesses. 
In a matter of months, homeowners from 14 major neighborhoods around Love Field 
coalesced and established the Love Field Citizens Action Committee.

Wright  Amendment  Becomes  Critical  Component  in  Love  Field’s  Noise 

Abatement Program and Love Field Master Plan 

81 

In  subsequent  years,  the  Wright  Amendment  came  to  be  recognized  as  a  key  as-
sumption and component in Love Field’s Noise Abatement Program by creating the 
foundation for balancing the needs of the airport with the needs of the surrounding 
community. It also created the foundation for balancing the role of Dallas Love Field 
in providing short-haul service with that of DFW International Airport in providing 
long-haul service. 

In  the  year  2000,  the  Dallas  City  Council  commissioned  the  Love  Field  Master 
Plan. DMJM Aviation, a nationally and internationally recognized aviation consult-
ant, conducted the study. 

The  development  of  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan  was  based  squarely  on  the  as-
sumption  that  the  Wright  Amendment  would  remain  in  effect.  As  stated  on  page 
1 of the Executive Summary of the Airport Impact Analysis/Master Plan, ‘‘the study 
was  undertaken  by  the  city  to  determine  the  highest  practical  use  of  Love  Field 
within  Federal  guidelines,  while  maintaining  balance  with  the  environmental  and 
socio-economic impacts that might result from increased use of the airport.’’ 

Also  stated  on  page  1  of  the  document,  ‘‘the  technical  approach  to  the  study  cen-
tered  around  a  demand  analysis  which  established  the  market  demand  profile  and 
growth  potential  of  Love  Field  given  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the  Wright/Shelby 
Amendment which were assumed to remain in effect.’’ 

Love Field residents played a key role in the master planning process due in large 
part  to  the  fundamental  operating  assumption  that  the  Wright  Amendment  would 
remain in place. Although the Master Plan forecasted aviation growth at Love Field, 
it  would  be  within  the  parameters  of  the  Wright  Amendment,  occurring  mostly  in 
smaller and quieter regional jets over an extended period of time resulting in mini-
mal impact on the noise contours. 

Members  of  the  Love  Field  Master  Plan  Advisory  Committee  included  Southwest 
Airlines,  American  Airlines,  Continental,  Delta,  general  aviation,  the  Love  Field 
Citizens  Action  Committee,  neighborhoods,  and  Love  Field  area  businesses.  New 
Legend Airlines also participated for a short period of time before it went out of ex-
istence due to a bad business plan. 

At  the  completion  of  the  study,  all  the  parties  signed  a  Consensus  Statement. 
Language in the statement included the phrase, ‘‘The Wright/Shelby Amendment is 
assumed  to  remain  intact.’’  The  first  signature  on  the  Statement  was  SWA’s  rep-
resentative, a corporate vice president. 

Very  much  because  of  this  agreement  among  the  diverse  parties,  the  Dallas  City 
Council  unanimously  approved  the  Master  Plan  in  April  2002  after  what  can  only 
be described as a tremendous community effort to reach a historic agreement on the 
future  of  this  center  city  airport.  The  Master  Plan  was  heralded  as  a  resolution  to 
more  than  two  decades  of  public  conflict  regarding  Love  Field,  its  impact  on  neigh-
borhoods, and its role in the North Texas transportation system. 
SWAs Betrays the Master Plan and the Community 

Then,  on  November  12,  2004,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Southwest  Airlines 
announced  a  corporate  assault  on  the  Wright  Amendment,  dropped  like  a  bomb-
shell, at a public breakfast meeting. In so doing, SWA broke apart the carefully con-
structed Master Plan consensus and destroyed the spirit of good will and trust that 
had shaped the plan for Love Field’s future. 

In  its  subsequent  public  relations  strategy,  SWA  would  have  its  target  audience 
believe many things. For example, it would have one believe that it had never want-
ed the Wright Amendment and that it had actually strongly opposed it. In fact, the 
airline  was  delighted  to  have  the  Wright  Amendment  in  place,  making  it  possible 
for SWA to expand its service to four additional states under its protection. 

SWA would also have its target audience believe that the Wright Amendment pre-
vents the airline from flying to other states directly from Love Field. In truth, SWA 
can  fly  out  of  Love  Field  today  to  any  destination  it  wants  in  aircraft  of  56  seats 
or less. 

In  addition,  SWA  would  have  its  target  audience  believe  that  the  removal  of  the 
Wright  Amendment  would  have  no  greater  negative  affect  on  the  neighborhoods 
around  Love  Field  than  what  is  provided  for  in  the  Master  Plan’s  future  forecasts. 
In  fact,  if  the  Wright  Amendment  were  removed,  a  change  in  the  future  fleet  mix 
of the airport would predictably occur to service new long haul markets. Future in-
creases in daily operations would not be in regional jets—as forecasted in the Mas-
ter  Plan—but  rather  in  larger  and  louder  planes  including  MD80s  and  other  air-
craft.  This,  in  turn,  would  result  in  increased  noise  and  ground  traffic,  well  beyond 
that  which  was  projected  by  the  Master  Plan.  In  reality,  long  haul  flights  require 
significantly  more  fuel  than  current  Wright  Amendment  destination  flights.  Planes

would  be  closer  to  the  end  of  the  runways  before  liftoff  and  lower  over  neighbor-
hoods for longer periods of time at full thrust before reaching the 1,000 feet of alti-
tude,  required  for  a  pilot  to  cut  the  power  back  to  reduce  noise.  Long  haul  service 
of Love Field would mean longer flights, more fuel, heavier planes, longer take-offs, 
airplanes  lower  over  the  neighborhoods  and  louder  noise.  In  other  words,  Longer, 
Lower, Louder. 

In  addition,  SWA  would  have  its  target  audience  believe  that  the  Master  Plan, 
as written, would still protect the neighborhoods. In fact, however, the Master Plan 
would  not  protect  the  neighborhoods  in  a  post-Wright  Amendment  Love  Field  be-
cause  no  studies  were  done  on  that  assumption.  There  would  be  no  way  to  guar-
antee  the  maximum  of  32  gates  provided  for  in  the  Master  Plan,  which  was  a  sig-
nificant  basis  for  the  historic  consensus.  In  truth,  any  future  City  Council  in  the 
future could decide to commission a new master planning study to accommodate the 
certain  increase  in  demand  from  other  airlines  for  additional  gates  at  Love  Field 
from which to serve long-haul destinations. Nor could the Master Plan enable man-
datory  noise  restrictions,  now  prohibited  by  a  1990  Federal  law.  Consequently,  any 
size  plane  could  fly  in  and  out  of  Love  Field  to  any  distant  location  as  many  times 
a day as desired at any time of the day and night. 

The  Love  Field  Master  Plan  would  very  likely  be  the  first  casualty  if  the  Wright 
Amendment  were  eliminated  along  with  its  32-gate  maximum.  SWA  already  con-
trols  21  of  these  gates;  14  on  the  West  Concourse  and  7  on  the  North  Concourse 
where the airline currently has its training facility. Backing out the 6 gates located 
at  the  former  Legend  Terminal  off  of  Lemmon  Avenue  on  the  other  side  of  the  air-
field,  there  would  remain  only  5  gates  in  the  Main  Terminal  for  other  airlines  that 
might also want to serve long haul markets out of Love Field. Other airlines seeking 
to  serve  Love  Field  would  inevitably  sue  the  City  of  Dallas  to  eliminate  the  gate 
limitation  portions  of  the  Master  Plan.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  City  of  Dallas  could 
legally sustain the Master Plan without the Wright Amendment in place. 
SWA’s Monopoly at Love Field 

To give perspective to the current debate, it is helpful to examine the comfortable 
position that Southwest Airlines enjoys at Dallas Love Field beginning with the fact 
that  it  has  established  a  strong  monopoly  with  a  market  share  as  high  as  100  per-
cent and currently between 95–96 percent in 2005. 

There  are  financial  benefits  as  well  at  Love  Field.  For  example,  Southwest  Air-
lines  currently  flies  into  60  airports.  Fifty-five  of  those  airports  have  a  Passenger 
Facility  Charge  (PFC)  ranging  from  $3.00  to  $4.50.  Only  five  of  those  airports  do 
not have a PFC. One of them is Dallas Love Field. 

In addition, each of the 60 airports that SWA flies into has a landing fee, ranging 
from  $0.29  to  $4.47  per  1,000  pounds  of  landing  weight.  Dallas  Love  Field  is  near 
the  bottom  of  the  list  with  the  second  lowest  landing  fee  at  only  $0.35,  based  on 
the  same  rate  structure  that  has  been  in  place  for  two  decades.  This  landing  fee 
is extremely low by industry standards. 

Recently,  the  financial  health  and  management  practices  of  Dallas  Love  Field 
have  received  attention.  In  February  2004,  Moody’s  downgraded  Love  Field’s  bond 
rating to Baa2. The airport was only one of two airports that were downgraded that 
year,  putting  Dallas’  airport  near  the  bottom  of  the  list  of  airports  in  the  United 
States. 

The  report  stated,  ‘‘In  Moody’s  opinion,  the  airline  payments  based  on  the  rates 
and  charges  ordinance  have  not  been  adjusted  to  cover  the  increased  cost  on  a  per 
unit  basis  as  a  result  of  the  steep  declines  in  enplaned  passengers.  In  fact,  airline 
payments  have  actually  decreased  over  this  volatile  time,  which  has  put  additional 
pressure  on  non-airline  revenues  and  have  caused  the  City  to  use  cash  balances  in 
reserve  for  future  capital  expenditures.  The  use  of  these  cash  balances  to  make  up 
the difference in operating revenues is a key factor in the rating downgrade.’’ 

Per Moody’s report, Dallas Love Field had to supplement by $8.9 million and $5.1 
million,  respectively,  from  excess  bond  proceeds  and  its  restricted  capital  funds  in 
order  to  meet  their  bond  covenants  for  FY  2002  and  FY  2003.  In  addition,  Moody’s 
reported  that  the  airport  planned  to  continue  to  draw  down  on  its  capital  funds  to 
supplement operations through FY 2008. Based on reviews of the airport’s FY 2005 
and  FY  2006  budgets,  Love  Field  has  continued  to  plan  for  deficits.  It  is  currently 
anticipated that the airport’s restricted cash account will be reduced from $84.3 mil-
lion  in  FY  2002  to  $28.5  million  in  FY  2009.  This  is  significant  deterioration  given 
that annual revenues are only approximately $30 million per year. 

Seven  months  later,  Standard  and  Poor’s  also  downgraded  Dallas  Love  Field  in 
September 2004, stating that it lowered its underlying rating issued for Dallas Love 
Field from A- to BBB as a result of the airport’s continued weak financial perform-
ance, generating debt service coverage on a cash flow basis of less than 1x in Fiscal

83 

Years 2002 and 2003 with debt service coverage on a cash flow basis not forecasted 
to be above 1x until 2009. 

The report noted the airport does not need to generate sufficient revenues to meet 
its  obligations  because  it  can  rely  on  other  fund  balances  practice  of  paying.  The 
report further noted its concern with declining unrestricted cash balances. According 
to the report, overall for Fiscal Year 2003, the unrestricted cash position was equiv-
alent to 171 days’ cash on hand. 

Four months later on January 14, 2005, the Office of the City Auditor of the City 
of  Dallas  issued  a  report  entitled  ‘‘Aviation  Lease  and  Rental  Agreements.’’  In  this 
report, the auditors stated the following findings: 

‘‘The reasonableness of Love Field rates, as established by the Aviation Depart-
ment, is questionable . . . . Aviation management’s reluctance to adjust rental 
rates  demonstrates  that  it  has  not  fully  assessed  the  circumstances  that  could 
make  the  airport(s)  self-sustaining.  Rates  have  remained  the  same  despite  ris-
ing  costs  for  utilities  and  significant  increases  in  security  costs  resulting  from 
the September 11, 2001 tragedy.’’ 

The  report  noted  the  operating  loss  in  recent  years  and  reminded  management 
that  cash  earmarked  for  capital  projects  is  a  restricted  asset  and  is  not  available 
for  airport  operations  and  maintenance.  The  auditor  reiterated  that  the  manage-
ment should strive to make the airport self-sustaining. The audit concluded that the 
airport  should  ‘‘strive  to  make  the  Airport  self-sustaining  by  developing  rates  and 
fees based on market conditions and based on its financial position and obligations.’’ 
LFCAC finds it hard to understand why airport management would plan to oper-
ate at a deficit, degrade its capital fund balance that will be required in the future, 
and  incur  a  bond  downgrade  when  airport  management  could  easily  raise  landing 
fees and/or terminal rents to mitigate the situation. Pre-September 2001, Love Field 
was one of the highest rated airports in the United States (A1 Moody’s/A S&P) with 
credit strengths that included low costs of operations and very strong liquidity (cash 
on hand). During the years since September 2001, there has been a dramatic down-
turn  in  the  financial  performance  of  the  airport  with  insufficient  revenues  to  pay 
operation and maintenance expenses and debt service. This has resulted in the air-
port  using  cash  in  the  construction  account  to  meet  debt  service  requirements  in-
stead of increasing other fees sufficiently such as airline rates and charges. In other 
words,  the  airport’s  construction  fund  is  subsidizing  the  operations  of  Southwest 
Airlines at Love Field. 

Although  the  use  of  surplus  revenues  to  pay  debt  service  is  allowed  under  the 
bond ordinance, this is not a common practice of commercial service airports in the 
United States. To that point, the current Baa2/Moody’s and BBB/S&P rating of Love 
Field  are  some  of  the  lowest  in  the  U.S.  and  are  definitely  lower  than  any  major 
city  airport  especially  given  the  City  of  Dallas’  AA  ratings  (the  County  of  Dallas  is 
rated AAA). 

In summary, given SWA’s dominant position at Love Field, it becomes reasonable 
to  question  whether  SWA  has  exerted  any  influence  or  control  over  these  pricing 
decisions.  It  is  also  reasonable  to  wonder  if  this  may  help  explain  why  the  airline 
steadfastly refuses to move to DFW International Airport, even when offered signifi-
cant financial incentives. 
Public Policy Debate Launched for Whose Benefit? 

The  current  debate  is  a  major  public  policy  issue  with  many  complex  elements 
and potential negative impacts on the regional aviation system of North Texas, the 
future  of  DFW  and  the  passengers  and  businesses  that  it  now  serves,  the  economy 
of  North  Texas,  the  tax  base  of  Dallas,  and  the  lives  of  tens  of  thousands  of  people 
who reside in the large noise impact area of Dallas Love Field. 

It  is  not  about  low  fares;  rather  it  is  about  one  airline  that  has  built  a  monopoly 
at  Dallas  Love  Field  as  a  result  of  the  Wright  Amendment  and  which  now  wants 
to  get  rid  of  it  in  order  to  further  expand  its  monopoly  and,  thereby,  discourage  its 
low-fare competitors from serving or expanding service at DFW. 

It  is  about  one  airline  that  wishes  the  elimination  of  a  law  in  order  to  serve  its 
singular  corporate  interest.  It  is  about  one  airline  that  betrayed  the  community  in 
which  its  corporate  home  exists,  destroyed  the  community  consensus  that  had,  at 
last, been achieved after more than two decades of conflict, and set upon a campaign 
to unravel the very foundation and successful relationship between two airports that 
are  only  8  miles  apart—each  of  which  has  an  important  role  as  a  long-haul  facility 
and as a short-haul facility in serving North Texas. 

As noted by Norm Scroggins in his testimony before the U.S. House of Represent-
atives  Aviation  Subcommittee  in  1991,  the  airports  share  the  most  complex  air 
space in the United States. (Norm Scroggins had 37 years in air traffic control and

84 

served  as  the  Manager  of  all  air  traffic  control  towers  in  North  Texas  for  six  years 
before his retirement.) 

It  is  about  one  airline  that  says  it  wants  competition  and  yet,  by  its  actions,  is 
doing  everything  possible  to  expand  a  monopoly  and  prevent  competition—both  at 
Love Field and at DFW. 
Summary: The Wright Amendment Provides Necessary Balance 

The  Wright  Amendment  is  the  best  approach  to  balancing  a  number  of  environ-
mental  and  aviation  related  factors  in  Dallas  and  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  region. 
It  balances  the  operations  of  an  inner  city  airport  with  the  environmental  impact 
of  those  operations  on  the  surrounding  community.  It  balances  the  role  and  niche 
of  an  inner  city  airport  that  provides  short-haul  service  and  that  of  a  regional  air-
port  that  provides  long-haul  service  by  creating  an  air  transportation  system  that 
is both efficient and effective. 

A  repeal  or  weakening  of  the  Amendment  would  destroy  the  balance  between 
Love  Field  operations  and  the  quality  of  life  of  our  neighborhoods.  It  would  bring 
more  noise,  air  pollution,  and  traffic  congestion  than  had  been  anticipated  in  the 
Love  Field  Master  Plan.  It  would  bring  renewed  public  conflict  that  would  jeop-
ardize the economic viability of much of Dallas’ vibrant center city that is impacted 
by  Love  Field  operations.  It  would  destabilize  the  North  Texas  air  transportation 
system. 

The  Wright  Amendment  is  not  about  preventing  low  fares—for,  in  fact,  low  fares 
can  benefit  a  much  larger  North  Texas  flying  public  at  DFW  International  Airport 
if  SWA  were  to  establish  service  there.  Instead,  the  Wright  Amendment  is  about 
balance, fairness, good sense, and sane public policy; it should be left as is. 

Senator BURNS. You bet. Thank you. 
We’ve  got  Dr.  Brian  Campbell,  with  The  Campbell-Hill  Aviation 

Group. Thank you, Doctor, for coming today. 

STATEMENT OF DR. BRIAN M. CAMPBELL, CHAIRMAN, 

CAMPBELL-HILL AVIATION GROUP, INC. 

Dr.  CAMPBELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the 

Committee. 

On  June  7th  of  this  year,  Campbell-Hill  released  a  study  that 
measured  the  economic  benefits  that  would  accrue  from  repeal  of 
the  Wright  Amendment.  We  analyzed  new  routes  from  Love  Field 
to  15  cities  beyond  the  current  Wright  Amendment  perimeter. 
These  cities  include  Baltimore,  the  Boston  area,  the  Chicago  area, 
Las  Vegas,  Los  Angeles,  Orlando,  Philadelphia,  Phoenix,  Reno,  St. 
Louis, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle, and Tampa. 
The  benefits  we  found  are:  3.7  million  additional  annual  pas-
sengers  to  and  from  North  Texas,  almost  $700  million  in  annual 
fare savings to the passengers, $1.7 billion in annual economic ben-
efits to the North Texas economy, and $1.8 billion in annual bene-
fits  for  the  communities  of  the  15  newly  connected  cities.  All  to-
gether,  the  economic  benefits  to  consumers  and  economies  around 
the country totals over $4 billion a year. Put another way, the cost 
of keeping the Wright Amendment in place is over $4 billion annu-
ally  in  just  these  15  markets.  This  equates  to  $500,000  an  hour 
just to keep the Wright Amendment in place. 

Many  of  these  findings  were  confirmed  by  SH&E,  an  aviation 
consulting firm, which DFW hired to study some of the same issues 
last  spring.  SH&E  found:  repealing  of  the  Wright  Amendment 
would lead to 3.6 million additional annual passengers to and from 
the  Dallas  area.  They  were  1.4  percent  below  my  estimate.  They 
found  that  total  market  savings  will  be  $715  million  per  year,  or 
3.8 percent above my estimate. And they found that there will only

85 

be  a  trivial  1.6  percent  decline  in  American’s  load  factor,  with  no 
decrease in flights at DFW. 

Together, these results underscore how costly the Wright Amend-
ment is to families, businesses, and the economy, not just in North 
Texas, but to dozens of cities and States around the country, where 
people  are  paying  excessive  airfares  and  not  traveling  at  all  or  as 
often as they would like to. 

The results of our study and the SH&E study are not surprising, 
because  the  Wright  Amendment  protects  American  Airlines  from 
competition  in  North  Texas.  Today,  American  accounts  for  85  per-
cent  of  the  flights  and  seats  at  DFW.  Because  of  the  Wright 
Amendment, it enjoys a monopoly on nonstop service to over 63 do-
mestic  cities  from  DFW  that  are  protected  by  the  Wright  Amend-
ment.  Not  surprisingly,  the  fares  American  charges  at  DFW  are 
significantly  higher  in  markets  when  there  is  no  Southwest  Love 
Field  competition,  but  American’s  fares  are  much  lower  on  the 
routes inside the Wright Amendment perimeter, where it competes 
with Southwest Airlines at Love Field. 

American  has  now  hired  Eclat  to  counter  these  findings.  How-
ever,  the  Eclat  report  suffers  from  numerous  fundamental  flaws 
that  undermine  its  conclusions.  The  key  assumptions  that  drive 
their  numbers  are  completely  inconsistent  with  American’s  com-
petitive behavior. 

First,  Eclat  assumes  American  will  transfer  45  daily  roundtrips 
to  Love  Field  to  compete,  flight  for  flight,  with  Southwest.  The 
study  contains  no  analysis  to  support  this  assumption.  It  is  con-
trary  to  American’s  own  behavior.  And  I  didn’t  hear  anything  like 
that verified by Mr. Arpey this morning. 

For example, in Chicago, where O’Hare and Midway Airports are 
only  15  miles  apart,  American  has  not  found  it  necessary  to  split 
its O’Hare hub to compete with Southwest’s large operation at Mid-
way Airport, which will soon be 204 departures per day. 

Second,  Eclat  erroneously  assumed  that  American  would  not 
lower  its  prices  and  compete  with  Southwest  on  fares,  either  at 
Love Field or DFW. This is completely contrary to American’s DFW 
pricing  strategy  in  the  12  markets  served  by  Southwest  at  Love 
Field  today,  and  it’s  completely  counter  to  American’s  behavior  at 
O’Hare, where it has lowered its fares significantly to compete with 
Southwest’s services at Midway. 

The  result  of  these,  and  equally  unsupported  or  irrational  as-
sumptions,  allows  Eclat  to  fabricate  an  endless  cascade  of  flight 
cancellations through American’s DFW schedule, designed solely to 
scare  the  public.  When  these  erroneous  assumptions  are  exposed, 
all of Eclat’s dire predictions collapse. 

One  of  the  Eclat’s  scare  tactics  is  to  show  large  losses  of  Ameri-
can’s  DFW  services  to  small  communities.  The  analysis  is  simply 
not credible. 

Let’s  take  an  example.  Eclat  lists  ten  DFW  markets  to  points  in 
Texas where Southwest does not operate from Love Field. Eclat as-
serts  that  these  ten  will  lose  16  of  their  51  daily  departures  to 
DFW, or 31 percent of them. This is silly. All ten of these markets 
are  American  monopolies  with  high  average  fares,  over  $100  per 
one-way  passenger  for  short-haul  trips.  And  American’s  traffic  in-
creased in those markets by 19 percent in the last year. It is illogi-

cal now to claim that American would reduce service in these mar-
kets,  where  it  already  imposed  monopoly—imposes  monopoly  pric-
ing and its traffic is growing. 

Eclat’s  predictions  are  completely  contrary  to  American’s  com-
petitive  behavior  in  Chicago,  as  well.  During  the  past  5  years, 
American nearly doubled the number of O’Hare nonstop markets it 
serves with regional or commuter aircraft from 31 to 60 city pairs, 
and  it  increased  total  departures  and  seat  capacity  by  more  than 
50 percent over the same period. American’s significant increase in 
Chicago service with small aircraft occurred at the very same time 
that  Southwest  dramatically  expanded  its  low-fare  service  at  Mid-
way. 

Eclat’s  assumption  that  American  will  eliminate  scores  of  DFW 
flights  in  small  or  regional  markets  is  contrary  to  the  factual  evi-
dence  of  American’s  own  behavior,  and  it  belies  sound  economic 
logic. 

And let me just say that if American Airlines’ hub at O’Hare Air-
port  has  ever  suffered  either  the  international,  the  long-haul,  or 
the  commuter  markets  while  Southwest  has  been  building  very 
steadily  and  very  significantly  at  Midway,  that  would  be  the 
centerpoint  of  their  case  today.  They  would  be  here  telling  you, 
‘‘Don’t  let  the  same  thing  happen  in  Dallas.’’  But  it  hasn’t  hap-
pened  in  Chicago.  And  it  hasn’t  happened  in  Miami/Fort  Lauder-
dale. And it hasn’t happened anywhere else. 

In summary, Eclat’s conclusions are contrary to the longstanding 
national  policy  of  deregulation  that  consumers  and  economies  are 
best  served  by  competition  among  airlines,  rather  than  protec-
tionism. 

Our  study  and  the  SH&E  study  show  that  not  acting  to  remove 
the  protectionism  of  the  Wright  Amendment  will  impose  an  enor-
mous  ongoing  cost  to  consumers,  businesses,  and  communities 
throughout the country. 

And  I  would  make  one  final  point,  and  that  is  that  since  Delta 
Air Lines dismantled its hub at DFW at the beginning of this year. 
American Airlines has increased the size and the scope of its flight 
operations by 70 or more departures per day. We are talking about, 
here,  Southwest  Airlines  starting  45  departures  per  day  at  Love 
Field.  American’s  windfall  from  the  Dallas—from  the  Delta  with-
drawal  at  Dallas/Fort  Worth—that  windfall  is  much  greater  than 
any  harm  that  they  could  come  up  with  for  new  services,  beyond 
the current perimeter—the Wright Amendment perimeter at Dallas 
Love Field. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. BRIAN M. CAMPBELL, CHAIRMAN, 

CAMPBELL-HILL AVIATION GROUP, INC. 

In  1978  Congress  deregulated  the  domestic  airline  industry.  Then,  in  1979  with 
the  passage  of  the  Wright  Amendment,  it  re-regulated  a  small  piece  of  the  busi-
ness—that dealing with service to Dallas Love Field. 

Because  of  the  Wright  Amendment,  American  enjoys  a  protected  position  today 
at  Dallas/Ft.  Worth.  American  accounts  for  85  percent  of  the  flights  and  seats  at 
DFW (Exhibit 1). It enjoys a monopoly on non-stop service over 63 protected domes-
tic  routes  between  DFW  and  cities  beyond  the  Wright  Amendment  Perimeter  (Ex-
hibit  2).  The  fares  American  charges  at  DFW  are  significantly  higher  in  markets 
when  there  is  no  Love  Field  competition;  American’s  fares  are  much  lower  on  the

87 

12  routes  where  it  competes  with  Southwest’s  flights  at  Love  Field  (Exhibit  3).  In 
fact,  American’s  domestic  fares  outside  of  Dallas  are  significantly  lower  than  those 
in  comparable  DFW  markets  that  do  not  have  Southwest  competition  (Exhibit  4). 
American  prices  its  Chicago  O’Hare  Airport  services  to  compete  with  Southwest, 
at  Chicago’s  Midway  Airport  in  the  36  markets  served  by  both  carriers  from  Chi-
cago.  Yet,  American  has  chosen  not  to  fly  head-to-head  with  Southwest  at  Midway. 
Nevertheless,  Southwest’s  new  market  entry  with  low  fares  at  Midway  has  caused 
the  O’Hare  carriers  to  respond  by  lowering  their  fares.  Traffic  at  both  airports  in-
creased,  and  dramatically  so  at  Midway  (See  specific  market  examples  in  Exhibits 
5 through 10). 

So,  Southwest’s  price  competition  has  worked  well  to  discipline,  and  in  fact,  lead 
its  competitors  and  expanded  markets  dramatically,  while  not  adversely  affecting 
American’s O’Hare Airport hub. In fact, American has expanded O’Hare routes and 
flights.  In  my  experience  American  has  always  been  aggressive  in  matching  com-
petitors’  price  and  service  offerings,  and  I  believe  American  will  respond  to 
Southwest’s prices in these 15 new Dallas Love Field routes. 

Our  firm  has  prepared  a  study  to  measure  the  consumer  benefits  and  economic 
impacts  that  will  accrue  from  new  Southwest  flights  at  Love  Field  if  the  Wright 
Amendment  is  repealed.  With  Southwest’s  concurrence  we  selected  15  new  Love 
Field  routes  beyond  the  current  Wright  Amendment  Perimeter.  And,  we  assumed 
initial  frequencies  of  three  round  trips  per  day  in  each  market.  At  its  typical  fares, 
which are well below prevailing prices at DFW, Southwest’s new 45 round trips per 
day at Love Field will generate: 

(1)  3.7  million  additional  passengers  each  year  to/from  North  Texas  (Exhibits 
11 and 12), 
(2)  $688  million  in  annual  fare  savings  to  North  Texas  travelers  (Exhibits  11, 
13 and 14), 
(3) $1.7 billion in annual economic benefits to North Texas (Exhibit 15), and 
(4)  $1.8  billion  in  annual  economic  impact  for  the  economies  of  the  15  newly 
connected cities (Exhibit 16). 

Last  spring  DFW  Airport  hired  Simat,  Helliesen  &  Eichner,  Inc.  (SH&E)  to  esti-
mate the impacts of repealing the Wright Amendment. Among SH&E findings were 
the following: 

(1)  there  will  be  3.6  million  additional  annual  Dallas  origin/destination  pas-
sengers (1.4 percent below my estimate), 
(2)  total  market  fare  savings  will  be  $715  million  per  year  (3.8  percent  more 
than my estimate), and 
(3)  the  initial  impact  on  American’s  DFW  operation  would  be  a  trivial  decline 
in load factor of 1.6 percentage points—from 78.9 percent to 77.3 percent—with 
no decrease in flights. 

DFW  Airport’s  consultants  (SH&E)  included  market  stimulation  analysis  that  is 

very similar to ours. 

and to rebut our findings. 

American has now hired Eclat to counter the results of the SH&E study for DFW, 

The Eclat report suffers from many fundamental infirmities. It is based on a few 
critical  assumptions  that  drive  their  mechanical  number  crunching.  The  key  as-
sumptions, for which there is no substantiating evidence, and which are completely 
counter to American’s competitive behavior, are as follows: 

(1) First, Eclat assumes that American will transfer 45 daily round trips to Love 
Field  to  compete  flight-for-flight  with  Southwest.  Eclat  does  not  say  whether 
American  told  them  to  assume  this  or  whether  this  would,  in  fact,  be  Ameri-
can’s competitive response. Eclats only reference for this assumption is a vague 
nonspecific  comment  made  by  Mr.  Arpey  to  the  press  last  February—9  months 
ago! 
(2)  Second,  Eclat  assumed  that  American  would  not  deviate  from  its  current 
DFW  fares—either  for  its  new  Love  Field  services,  or  for  the  remaining  flights 
at DFW. Eclat simply assumed that American will not lower its price and com-
pete  with  Southwest  on  fares.  This  is  completely  contrary  to  American’s  DFW 
pricing  strategy  in  markets  served  by  Southwest  at  Love  Field  today;  and  it  is 
completely  counter  to  American’s  consistent  behavior  at  O’Hare  where  it  has 
lowered  its  fares  significantly  to  compete  with  Southwest’s  services  at  Midway 
Airport.

88 

The result of these major assumptions, along with others that are equally unsup-
ported  or  irrational,  causes  Eclat  to  create  a  cascading  effect  through  American’s 
flight  schedule.  Essentially  it  is  saying  that  without  any  fare  response  (reduction) 
its  model  shows  that  American  will  simply  cancel  140  daily  round  trip  flights  at 
DFW, because by shifting 45 round trips to Love Field it will suffer the loss of con-
necting  passengers.  There  is  no  price/fare  element,  and  no  profit  and  loss  element 
(or analysis) in Eclat’s model. It is fabricated entirely from a series of irrational as-
sumptions  designed  to  scare  the  public.  When  these  assumptions  are  exposed  and 
proven to be untrue, all of Eclat’s forecast of dire consequences will collapse. 

One  significant  Eclat  tactic  is  to  show  large  losses  of  American’s  DFW  service  to 
small communities. This analysis is simply not credible. It all results from their set 
of irrational assumptions. 

For  example,  on  page  45  of  its  report  Eclat  lists  ten  DFW  markets  to  points  in 
Texas  where  Southwest  does  not  operate  from  Love  Field.  Eclat  asserts  that  these 
ten  will  lose  16  of  their  51  daily  departures  to  DFW.  This  is  absurd!  All  ten  are 
American  monopoly  markets  with  high  average  fares  (over  $100  per  one-way  pas-
senger),  and  American’s  traffic  increased  by  19.1  percent  from  the  second  quarter 
of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005. American will not weaken itself in these mar-
kets  simply  because  Southwest  has  begun  new  service  at  Love  Field  to  points  be-
yond Texas and the region. 

American’s  competitive  behavior  in  Chicago  is  completely  contrary  to  Eclat’s 
model assumptions and results. During the past five years 1 American has increased 
the  number  of  O’Hare  non-stop  markets  served  with  commuter/regional  aircraft— 
from 31 to 60 city-pairs. Correspondingly, its total departures and seat capacity with 
aircraft  under  75  seats  increased  by  more  than  50  percent  (Exhibit  17).  American’s 
significant  increase  in  Chicago  service  to  small  communities  occurred  at  the  very 
same  time  (November  2000  to  November  2005)  that  Southwest  expanded  its  low 
fare Midway Airport service. Southwest added 20 new routes and increased its total 
departures  and  seat  capacity  by  70  percent  over  the  past  five  years  (Exhibit  18). 
Eclat’s  assumption  that  American  will  eliminate  scores  of  DFW  flights  in  small  or 
regional markets is strikingly contrary to the factual evidence of American’s behav-
ior and it belies sound economic logic. 

If American does not compete with Southwest on price, then total market stimula-
tion,  total  fare  savings,  and  total  economic  benefits  will  initially  be  less  than  what 
I  and  DFW’s  consultant  have  projected.  Both  of  our  studies  assumed  competitive 
pricing  response  by  American.  Nevertheless,  if  American  chooses  to  go  against  all 
of its history, and to not be price competitive, then it will lose some passengers, but 
the  total  Dallas  market  will  still  be  much  larger,  and  Southwest  will  have  the  op-
portunity  to  add  a  lot  more  flights  to  those  15  markets.  So,  in  time,  the  overall 
North Texas market impacts would grow to the levels projected in our study. 

So  why  would  American  not  defend  its  position  and  compete  on  fares  in  the  15 

new Southwest routes? This is a mystery and it’s a major flaw in Eclat’s logic. 

Eclat made a lot of other self-serving errors. 

(1)  It  moved  arbitrarily  31  percent  of  American’s  flights  in  the  15  markets  to 
Love Field, but assumed that 35 percent to 65 percent of the passengers would 
shift. This makes no sense, especially when it assumes further that American’s 
fares will remain static for its purported Love Field service. 
(2) It assumed many other carriers would move flights from DFW to Love with 
no  factual  basis  for  the  assumption.  Actually,  AirTran  recently  announced  its 
complete withdrawal from the DFW—Los Angeles market. 
(3)  Eclat  assumed  that  in  any  market  where  American  suffered  a  5  percent  or 
more  decline  in  load  factor,  it  would  reduce  frequencies,  and  this  is  irrational 
and unsupported in history. 
(4)  It  assumed  any  load  factor  below  85  percent  in  multi-frequency  markets 
would trigger a reduction in flights. This too makes no sense. 
(5) In its so-called stimulation analysis Eclat selectively included some markets, 
and excluded others. 
(6)  Eclat  focused  certain  analyses  on  low-fare  carriers  as  a  group,  and  not  just 
Southwest’s  actions  and  the  market’s  response.  No  other  airline  operates 
Southwest’s business model. 
(7)  There  is  no  recognition  of  what  American  gained  at  DFW  when  Delta  dis-
mantled its hub early this year. In fact, American has 70 more daily departures 
today than it did a year ago; and this is 56 percent more than the 45 departures 

1 November 2000 to November 2005.

Eclat  assumes  American  would  have  to  shift  to  Love  Field  to  compete  with 
Southwest.  American’s  windfall  from  the  demise  of  Delta’s  hub  is  greater  than 
any  competitive  harm  it  might  suffer  from  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment. 
One Wall Street firm estimated the value to American of Delta’s withdrawal at 
$600 million per year in revenue. 

In brief, Eclat’s conclusions are pre-ordained by its unsubstantiated assumptions, 
especially the assumption that American will not lower its fares to compete with the 
new Southwest services. Since deregulation in 1978 it has not been the U.S. Govern-
ment’s  policy  to  protect  carriers  that  do  not  want  to  compete  on  fares.  This  is  a 
major Achilles heel in the Eclat study. 

I wish to point out that the Eclat study is silent with respect to consumer benefits 
(or fare savings), or economic impacts to North Texas and the 15 cities that will ben-
efit from new low fare service at Love Field. 

Finally,  the  extent  to  which  Eclat  purported  to  characterize  what  Southwest 

might do after repeal of the Wright Amendment reveals two things: 

(1) Eclat lacks an understanding of how the Wright Amendment works in prac-
tice; and 
(2) Eclat lacks any understanding of Southwest Airlines’ business model. 

Eclat  states  that  Southwest  has  reduced  service  in  some  of  the  existing  Wright 
Amendment  markets.  But,  it  misses  the  point!  After  9/11  air  travel  in  short  haul 
markets  suffered  generally,  and  in  some  cases  by  large  degrees.  Due  to  heightened 
fears of flying after 9/11, coupled with new time-consuming and personally undesir-
able  airport  security  procedures,  a  lot  of  short  haul  passengers  avoided  flying.  Yet 
short haul markets are the only markets available to Southwest within the current 
Wright Amendment prohibition. 2 

By repeal of the Wright Amendment Southwest’s low fares would stimulate travel 
from  existing  Wright  Amendment  markets  to  new  markets,  allowing  Southwest  to 
grow these short haul markets again. 

In its report Eclat predicts that Southwest’s service to some cities will decline be-
cause  it  could  ‘‘fly  over’’  those  cities  after  repeal.  By  definition,  all  traffic  between 
Love  Field  and  the  alleged  ‘‘fly  over’’  cities  is  local,  because  no  connecting  or  one- 
stop  passengers  are  permitted  under  the  silly  and  unjust  restrictions  on  through 
ticketing  and  marketing.  Upon  repeal,  Southwest  could  sell  connections  and  single- 
plane through service with just one check-in by the passenger. That would strength-
en  the  service  between  Love  Field  and  the  ‘‘fly  over’’  cities.  The  dramatic  improve-
ment in service and reduction in fares to Love Field will bring about even more traf-
fic stimulation as a result of repealing the Wright Amendment.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM S. SWELBAR, PRESIDENT/MANAGING 

PARTNER, ECLAT CONSULTING, INC. 

Mr.  SWELBAR.  Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Burns,  Senator 

Hutchison, other Members of the Committee. 

My  name  is  William  Swelbar.  I  am  President  and  Managing 
Partner  of  Eclat  Consulting.  And,  based  on  Mr.  Kelleher’s  testi-
mony  and  my  good  friend  Dr.  Campbell’s  testimony,  I  am  not  the 
consultant that worked for DFW Airport. 

I  am  appearing  today  as  the  principal  author  of  a  study  per-
formed  for  American  Airlines  entitled,  ‘‘Repealing  the  Wright 
Amendment—Risks  Facing  Small  Communities  in  the  Dallas 
Metroplex.’’ 

2 In  fact,  9  of  Southwest’s  12  routes  from  Love  Field  are  less  than  350  miles.  To  many,  this 

is hardly worth the airport ‘‘hassle factor.’’

While  this  issue  would  appear  to  be  a  Dallas/Fort  Worth  issue 
only, it is not. It may appear to be a Southwest and American issue 
only.  It  is  not.  It  may  appear  to  be  an  issue  only  for  those  eight 
states  currently  named  in  the  Wright  and  Shelby  legislation.  It  is 
not. It may appear to be a simple issue. It is not. 

The analysis that is the core of our work done for American could 
be applied at virtually any carrier—air-carrier hub operation in the 
U.S.  Eight  Members  of  this  Subcommittee  are  from  states  that 
have  large  hub-and-spoke  airport  operations.  Twelve  Members  of 
this Committee rely on hubs and spokes for their access to the U.S. 
air transportation system. And, in our estimation, at least 12 Mem-
bers  of  this  Committee  represent  states  that  would  be  negatively 
impacted by repeal. 

I would like to summarize three basic findings of our study. 
First,  smaller  communities  must  rely  on  hubs  for  effective  air 
service.  Only  network  airlines  like  American,  which  have  invested 
billions  of  dollars  in  aircraft  and  airport  infrastructure,  can  effec-
tively  serve  smaller  communities.  Airlines  that  we  refer  to  in  our 
study,  LMOs,  or  large-market  oriented,  carriers  like  Southwest  do 
not, and cannot, serve small communities. 

The  second  point  I  would  like  to  emphasize  is  that  hub  oper-
ations  are  fragile.  That  is  why  industry  and  market  changes  have 
resulted  in  the  closure  of  many  smaller  hubs  at  Raleigh,  at  Nash-
ville,  and,  most  recently,  at  Pittsburgh.  Hubs  rely  on  an  elaborate 
web  of  interdependencies  among  large  and  small  cities  they  serve. 
As  individual  flights  to  and  from  a  hub  are  impacted,  so,  too,  are 
many  other  flights.  It  is  a  cascading  effect,  and  that—and  Mr. 
Arpey  referred  to  that  this  morning.  Hubs  cannot  survive  on  the 
basis  of  connecting  passengers  alone,  and  many  of  the  calculations 
that  are  being  tossed  around  today  are  including  connecting  pas-
sengers. And we can get to that, if necessary. 

This  is  a  critical  point  for  DFW.  If  local  Dallas/Fort  Worth  pas-
sengers  shift  to  Love  Field,  the  DFW  hub  must,  and  will,  be  im-
pacted.  And  it  will  be  impacted  to  a  much  greater  extent—several 
times greater, actually—than the number of passengers who decide 
to  use  Love  Field  instead.  The  mechanics  of  airline  networks  are 
complicated, but suffice it to say it takes very little time to degrade 
a hub. 

Third, the so-called ‘‘Southwest Effect’’ is yesterday’s benefit still 
being  claimed  today.  Ten  years  ago,  it  was  true  that  new  service 
by Southwest resulted in an increase in a large number of new pas-
sengers flying. ‘‘New,’’ being the operative word. Now, however, al-
most  every  large  community  in  the  country  already  has  service 
from  one  or  more  of  the  LMOs.  When  Southwest  or  another  LMO 
enters  a  market  today,  the  result  is,  predominantly,  to  change  a 
traveler’s  driving  pattern.  The  travelers  were  going  to  fly  anyway. 
They are not net new passengers to the system. But now they drive 
to a different airport than the one they previously used. 

In  industry  terms,  the  primary  result  of  repealing  the  Wright 
Amendment  would  be  to  divert  traffic  to  Love  Field,  not  to  stimu-

noon.  It  is  a  complicated  issue  that  has  Dallas/Fort  Worth  routes 
and,  in  our  estimation,  far-reaching  tentacles.  There  are  many 
other  tangential  issues  relating  to  this  debate  that  are  addressed 
in our study. 

For  a  student  of  the  industry,  the  effort  to  repeal  the  Wright 
Amendment appears to be an effort to change the economic frame-
work  of  the  industry  to  benefit  one  carrier  at  the  expense  of,  not 
only Dallas/Fort Worth, but also the cities that rely on DFW today. 
Before  any  action  is  taken  on  this  important  issue,  please  rely 
less on sound bites, about the enormous economic benefits that will 
be  derived  from  repeal,  and  more  about  an  analysis  of  the  impor-
tance of a network industry to the—network carriers to the U.S. air 
transportation system. 

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  and  ask  that  the  study,  as  well 

as my testimony, be entered into the record. 

Senator  BURNS.  Without  objection,  it  sure  will  be,  and  we  thank 

you for coming today. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Swelbar follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM S. SWELBAR, PRESIDENT/MANAGING PARTNER, 

ECLAT CONSULTING, INC. 

Introduction 

Good  Morning  Chairman  Burns,  Senator  Rockefeller,  and  other  members  of  the 
Subcommittee. My name is William Swelbar. I am President and Managing Partner 
of Eclat Consulting, Inc., a firm that specializes in assessing economic, financial and 
regulatory issues and their impact on commercial air transportation companies and 
the industry. I am appearing today as the principal author of a study performed on 
behalf  of  American  Airlines  entitled:  ‘‘Repealing  the  Wright  Amendment—Risks 
Facing Small Communities and the Dallas Metroplex.’’ 

While  this  issue  would  appear  to  be  only  a  Dallas/Ft.  Worth  issue;  it  is  not.  It 
may  appear  to  be  a  Southwest  and  American  issue  only;  it  is  not.  It  may  appear 
to  be  an  issue  only  for  those  eight  states  currently  named  in  each  the  Wright  and 
Shelby legislation; it is not. This is an issue that touches 95 cities in 29 states and 
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 

Eight  Members  of  this  Subcommittee  are  from  states  that  have  large  hub  and 
spoke airport operations and twelve Members of this Subcommittee represent states 
that  are  dependent  on  hub  and  spoke  systems  for  access  to  the  U.S.  air  transpor-
tation  system.  The  analysis  that  is  the  core  of  our  work  done  for  American  could 
be  applied  at  virtually  any  air  carrier  hub  and  spoke  operation.  Depending  on  the 
scope and scale of that operation, the results of lost service to communities depend-
ent on that operation would be similar. 
Background 

First, the study we performed distinguishes between the two major sectors of the 
U.S.  airline  industry.  The  network  carriers  are  the  traditional  hub  and  spoke  ori-
ented  carriers  and  include:  American,  Continental,  Delta,  Northwest  and  United. 
The Large Market-Oriented carriers (LMOs) are: Southwest, jetBlue, AirTran, Fron-
tier, ATA and Spirit. 

It  is  most  important  to  distinguish  between  these  two  carrier  types  because  the 
network  carriers  have  invested  billions  of  dollars  to  serve  cities  of  all  sizes,  while 
the  LMOs  have  not.  The  ten  smallest  cities  served  by  Southwest  have  an  average 
population of 728,000 people versus an average of 103,000 people for the 10 smallest 
communities in the American network. 

Hub  and  spoke  systems  keep  the  overwhelming  majority  of  markets  connected  to 
the air transportation system. The networks of the LMOs do not, nor do they show 
any proclivity toward serving small cities in the future. 
Fundamental Premise of the Eclat Study for American 

In its campaign to repeal the Wright Amendment, Southwest has released an eco-
nomic  study  suggesting  that  it  would  initiate  service  to  15  new  markets—all  large 
U.S.  domestic  markets—from  Dallas  Love  Field  Airport  (DAL).  The  listing  of  sug-
gested new markets to be served was corroborated by Gary Kelly, Southwest’s CEO.

Gerard  Arpey,  CEO  of  American,  has  made  it  clear  in  his  public  statements  that 
if  Southwest  were  to  initiate  service  to  these  15  points  at  Love  Field,  American 
would  have  no  choice  but  to  move  service  from  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International 
(DFW)  to  match  the  new  competition.  Herein  lies  the  core  assumption  in  the  fol-
lowing analysis. 

It  is  a  logical  competitive  response  that  American  feels  compelled  to  protect  its 
competitive  position  in  the  Dallas  Metroplex  market  from  new  competition.  In  fact, 
any carrier would move to protect its home market and it happens every day in this 
hypercompetitive  industry.  The  movement  of  90  flights  to/from  DFW  results  in  a 
loss  of  279  other  American  flights  because  the  hub  and  spoke  system  creates  the 
interdependency on each local domestic, connecting domestic, local international and 
connecting international passenger. 

Our  analysis  concludes  that  American  would  lose  up  to  36  percent  of  its  traffic 
base  at  DFW,  while  the  airport  itself  would  see  27  percent  of  its  passenger  traffic 
leave  based  on  American’s  competitive  response  at  DAL.  And  while  Love  Field  will 
see  significantly  higher  passenger  traffic,  the  Metroplex  in  total  will  see  a  decline 
in passenger activity.

In  all,  95  markets  connecting  to  DFW  are  negatively  impacted  by  the  reduction 
in the breadth of the American hub complex there. Depending on the degree of new 
services  added  by  Southwest,  there  are  21  cities  in  16  states  where  we  believe 
American  will  face  a  decision  to  keep  some  service  or  simply  exit  the  market  be-
cause it would not be able to support sufficient frequencies that allow it to maintain

Much of the advantage that Southwest has cited over its history has been the de-
livery of low fares to a market. But that began to change in 2001 as industry fares 
began  to  decline  rapidly  even  before  the  events  of  September  11.  Since  the  first 
quarter of 2001, American’s fares have decreased 28 percent at DFW, while average 
fares  at  Love  Field  by  Southwest  have  decreased  4  percent.  This  is  true  in  nearly 
every  hub  city  for  nearly  every  network  carrier.  The  fare  gap  between  the  network 
carriers  and  the  LMOs  has  closed  significantly  and  therefore  the  economics  of  low 
fares are simply not what they were even 5 years ago, let alone 10 or 15 years ago. 
In other words, in today’s pricing environment for the U.S. airline industry, the re-
vered ‘‘Southwest Effect’’ is ancient history. 

A  misunderstood  fact  is  that  it  is  not  just  competition  with  the  LMOs  that  are 
driving  fares  down.  American’s  fares  in  Dallas  markets  without  LMO  competition 
are  down  31  percent  since  the  first  quarter  of  2001.  Small  communities  have  bene-
fited  significantly  by  the  growth  of  network  carrier  hubs  in  terms  of  both  service 
and  price  competition.  The  use  of  regional  jet  aircraft  have  made  hubs  accessible 
that  were  not  envisioned  even  10  years  ago.  No  one  would  have  thought  in  1995 
that Green Bay, Wisconsin would have nonstop jet service to Dallas/Ft Worth.

Stimulation Is Really Mostly Diversion in Today’s Environment 

94 

Another  misunderstood  fact  in  the  industry  is  the  claim  by  the  LMO  sector  that 
they cause significant stimulation of new demand. Yes, some new demand is created 
but  it  is  nowhere  near  the  levels  we  saw  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Today’s  ‘‘LMO 
Effect’’  is  less  about  generating  new  demand  and  more  about  diverting  existing  de-
mand from an airport within the same, or nearby, metropolitan area. It makes great 
headlines  for  one  airport,  but  when  you  look  at  the  sum  total  of  demand  at  all  of 
the airports in a single metropolitan area, a very different story presents itself. 

This study is not intended to refute on a point-by-point basis the study conducted 
for Southwest. However, that study’s claim that the Dallas market will benefit from 
stimulation of new demand in the area of 60 percent is simply not true. We estimate 
that,  based  on  LMO  activity  in  other  large  metro  areas,  new  Southwest  service 
could perhaps produce passenger stimulation of 15 percent. 

We  say  ‘‘perhaps’’  because  Southwest  already  carries  passengers  to  Love  Field 
from multiple airports within the Wright Amendment states. Because this is already 
happening  today,  those  passengers  cannot  be  counted  as  new  demand  to  the 
Metroplex.  Therefore,  the  real  stimulation  or  new  demand  is  somewhere  in  the  5– 
10  percent  area—a  far  cry  from  the  60  percent  claim.  If  the  Wright  Amendment 
were to be repealed, we doubt that Southwest would continue to offer the same level 
of service it does today at cities like Albuquerque, Houston Hobby, Austin, New Or-
leans,  El  Paso,  San  Antonio,  Little  Rock,  Oklahoma  City  and  Tulsa.  Those  cities 
would  no  longer  serve  as  connecting  points  for  passengers  traveling  to  Dallas  and 
would instead be ‘‘overflown’’ by Southwest. 
Bottom Line Findings 

In  all,  95  markets  connecting  to  DFW  are  negatively  impacted  by  the  reduction 
in the breadth of the American hub complex there. Depending on the degree of new 
services  added  by  Southwest,  there  are  21  cities  in  16  states  where  we  believe 
American  will  face  a  decision  to  keep  some  service  or  simply  exit  the  market  be-
cause it would not be able to support sufficient frequencies that allow it to maintain 
meaningful  presence.  They  are:  Longview  and  McAllen,  TX;  Texarkana,  AR;  Bir-
mingham,  AL;  Vail/Eagle,  CO;  Louisville,  KY;  Reno,  NV;  Norfolk,  VA;  Ft.  Myers, 
Jacksonville,  Pensacola  and  West  Palm  Beach,  FL;  Greenville/Spartanburg,  SC; 
Oakland, CA; Greensboro, NC; Dayton, OH; Providence, RI; Chicago-MDW and Peo-
ria, IL; and Ft. Wayne, IN.

Closing Remarks 

95 

Much is misunderstood about this industry. To the uninformed, the Large-Market 
Oriented carriers are the savior of the U.S. air transportation system and will ulti-
mately inherit the earth, while the Legacy, Network hub and spoke carriers are the 
bloated,  inefficient  sector.  In  fact,  the  network  carriers,  like  American,  have  in-
vested  billions  of  dollars  in  the  right  types  of  aircraft  and  network  architecture  to 
best  serve  cities  like  Lawton,  OK  and  Springfield,  MO,  and  not  just  cities  like  Los 
Angeles, CA and Orlando, FL. 

The LMOs, including Southwest, are not and will probably never be interested in 
serving  Green  Bay,  WI  or  Peoria,  IL.  What  they  do  is  to  set  up  shop  at  airports 
in large cities and look for consumers willing to drive to take their flights. They con-
tinue to rely on their original marketing claims of low fares and the creation of new 
demand. Those claims, however, are becoming a part of history. They ignore the fact 
that  airfares  have  dropped  dramatically  for  everyone  since  2000.  They  portray  a 
David  and  Goliath  world  that  no  longer  exists,  unless  one  considers  Southwest  to 
be the new Goliath. 

Some  of  today’s  low  fares  are  the  result  of  LMO  competition.  Equally  important, 
however—and  much  more  important  for  small  cities—is  the  hyper-competition  be-
tween  network  carriers  as  they  vie  for  each  incremental  passenger,  who  can  make 
the  difference  between  a  profitable  flight  or  not.  Without  hubs,  there  would  be  sig-
nificantly fewer spokes—that is the plain and simple truth. Just ask folks in Read-
ing,  PA  or  Utica,  NY,—small  markets  that  have  already  been  disenfranchised  from 
the U.S. air transportation system. 

For a student of the industry, the effort to repeal the Wright Amendment appears 
to be an effort to change the economic framework of the industry to benefit one car-
rier  at  the  expense  of  not  only  Dallas,  but  also  the  cities  that  rely  on  DFW  today. 
The  LMO(s)  that  would  benefit  from  such  a  change  simply  do  not  have  the  right 
sized  aircraft  today  to  profitably  serve  city  pairs  like  Birmingham,  AL  to  Dallas 
multiple times a day, and those cities will continue to experience a decline in short- 
haul service. 

So  before  any  action  on  this  important  issue  is  taken,  please  rely  less  on  sound 
bites  about  the  enormous  economic  benefits  that  will  be  derived  from  the  repeal  of 
the  Wright  Amendment  and  rely  more  on  analysis  of  a  network  industry  where 
interdependencies  exist  at  each  and  every  corner.  This  is  just  one  example  of  the 
fragility  of  network  architecture  and  there  will  probably  be  other  ramifications  for 
other carriers and hubs as well. 

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  present  my  views,  and  request  that  my  testi-
mony  and  a  copy  of  the  study  entitled  ‘‘Repealing  the  Wright  Amendment—Risks 
Facing  Small  Communities  and  the  Dallas  Metroplex’’  be  entered  into  the  record. * 

Senator  BURNS.  Senator  Hutchison,  do  you  have  questions  for 

this group? I’ve got a couple, and I’ll follow you. 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I would just like to ask Mrs. Palmer—— 
First  of  all,  let  me  say,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  I  do  hope  that  the 
neighborhoods—and  I’m  very  pleased  that  you  allowed  the  neigh-
borhoods  to  come  and  be  a  part  of  this  hearing—and  I  hope  that 
they are listened to, because they are the forgotten ones, as we are 
talking  about  policies  and  what  Congress  has  done  and  what  has 
happened through all these years. And the people who live around 
Love  Field  were  under  the  expectation  from  the  beginning  that 
Love  Field  would  be  first  closed,  then  left  open,  but  on  a  limited 
basis. And I think we have to take into account the effect. 

So, I want to ask Ms. Palmer, Why do you think the master plan 
will be blown apart if the Wright Amendment changes the playing 
field? 

Ms.  PALMER.  That’s  an  excellent  question,  and  a  very  important 

one to this debate. 

The master plan projected increases in operations at the airport, 
under  the  Wright  Amendment,  to  be  in,  primarily,  regional  jets. 

* The information referred to has been retained in Committee files.

The  noise  forecasts  followed  a  regional-jet  fleet-mix  growth  and 
also the traffic congestion forecasts. 

This  is  what  will  happen  if  this  airport  is  opened  up  to  become 
a  national  airport.  Regional  jets  will  not  be  the  instrument  of 
growth.  They  will  be  larger  planes.  Now,  larger  planes  today  are 
quieter  than  larger  planes  yesterday,  but  larger  planes  are  still 
noisier than regional jets. 

In  order  to  implement  certain  noise-abatement  procedures,  Sen-
ator,  a  plane  has  to  be  about  a  thousand  feet  above  the  ground 
leaving  Love  Field.  A  large  plane  has  to  go  a  lot  further  over  the 
neighborhoods  to  reach  a  1,000-feet  altitude  in  order  to  change 
course.  So,  there  are  a  lot  of  noise  impacts  that  are,  frankly,  no- 
brainers  at  all  in  looking  at  the  scenario  for  the  future  if  the 
Wright  Amendment  were  lifted.  There  are  other  impacts,  as  well, 
but that is, for us, one of the most critical and defined impacts. 

Senator BURNS. May I ask—— 
Senator HUTCHISON. The—— 
Senator BURNS.—a follow-up to that? 
Senator HUTCHISON. Yes. 
Senator  BURNS.  Since  you’re—sort  of  like  the  status  quo,  would 

you support the idea of shutting Love Field completely down? 

Ms.  PALMER.  No,  sir,  we  would  not.  And  I’ll  tell  you  why.  It  has 
never  been  our  intent  to  shut  down  Love  Field.  We  are  advocates 
of  a  good,  efficient,  effective  air-transportation  system,  and  we  be-
lieve  that  the  Wright  Amendment  helps  the  airport  be,  and  do, 
that.  We  have  worked  25  years  to  help  that  airport  be  a  good 
neighbor, and we certainly would not want it to be closed down. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Following  along  that  line,  it  has  been  men-
tioned  here,  in  several  different  configurations,  that  perimeter 
rules  have  only  been  mandated  on  one  airport  by  Congress.  And, 
of  course,  that  is  National  Airport.  And  nothing  has  been  men-
tioned  about  the  place  where  perimeter  rules  were  put  in  part  of 
a regional plan. And that is in New York, where you do have short- 
haul  airport—short  haul—LaGuardia  versus  different  uses  for 
Newark and John F. Kennedy. 

I  would  like  to  ask  the  two  experts,  or  anyone  who  would  like— 

not that you’re not an expert, Sam—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  HUTCHISON.—but  anyone  who  would  like  to  answer—if, 
in  fact,  the  LaGuardia  New  York  model  is  one  that  works  for  the 
consumer.  And  it  has  been  upheld  in  the  courts,  because  it  was  a 
local  plan  for  the  region,  I  assume  in  an  attempt  to  give  the  best 
service for the different types of flying public; meaning, the closer- 
in airport from the shorter perimeter, where you could have pretty 
easy access, versus the longer-haul one where you have more of an 
international port of entry and the airport is made for that port of 
entry,  which  would  be  John  F.  Kennedy,  and  then  the  longer-haul 
airport,  which  is  Newark—does  that  work  well  for  the  traveling 
public,  which  is  something  that  we  all  want  to  accommodate?  We 
do  want  to  have  the  best  service  for  the  flying  public.  We  want  to 
take  into  account  the  neighborhoods,  and  we  want  the  economies 
of our area to prosper. 

So,  back  to  my  question.  Is  the  New  York  model  something  that 
does work for the flying public, but then maybe could be something

done  that  would  also  accommodate  the  needs  of  the  North  Texas 
region,  where  the  airports  are  located,  and  the  economy  and  the 
neighborhoods, all together? 

Dr. Campbell? 
Dr. CAMPBELL. Thank you very much, Senator Hutchison. 
I  believe,  in  the  case  of  New  York,  LaGuardia  has  been  limited 
more  by  technical  considerations  than  by  economic  regulation.  The 
airport today operates, I know, at least as far, nonstop, as Denver. 
And  it  has  not  had  the  same  kind  of  perimeter-rule  treatment  as 
Washington  National.  And  I  might  say,  as  an  aside,  that  Wash-
ington  National  perimeter  used  to  be  750  miles;  today  it’s  1,250. 
And  American  was  one  of  the  primary  agitators  to  get  that  ex-
tended, because they felt the need for it. 

But  LaGuardia—every  airport  that  is  desirable  to  the  customer 
is desirable whether you’re going to Los Angeles or whether you’re 
going  only  to  Philadelphia  or  Cincinnati.  Those  passengers  would 
prefer  to  go  to  the  close-in  airport  if  they  are  going  to  the  central 
business  district,  in  particular—or  Manhattan,  in  the  case  of  New 
York.  So,  the  market  doesn’t  divide  itself  neatly  in  that  respect. 
What you would find is that making people go to John F. Kennedy, 
which  might  be  an  extra  40  minutes  away,  is  maybe  more  accept-
able to a person who’s making a 5- or a 7-hour flight than someone 
who’s making a 2-hour flight, so that you don’t lose as much—there 
isn’t  as  much  erosion  of  demand  for  air  travel,  because  they  will 
incur that longer access time. 

But  that’s  a  suboptimum  solution.  That  doesn’t  really  give  you 
what—that doesn’t reflect what the market wants. And that’s what 
we’re talking about here, I think, in this proceeding, is opening up 
perfectly  good  facilities  to  competition  where  you  can  technically 
operate, and there aren’t any limitations on the technical capability 
of Love Field to handle flights as far as Seattle and Boston. So any-
thing else is really an interference with the marketplace. 

And, really, with all due respect, the whole issue is fairly simple 
to  me  at  the  policy  and  philosophical  level.  It’s  a  question  of,  are 
you  for  competition?  Are  you  for  consumerism?  Do  you  believe  in 
economic development through better efficiency and lower prices to 
the public? Or are you for protectionism, for keeping a well-proven, 
dynamic,  and  capable  airline  from  competing  head  to  head  in  the 
same  markets  with  the  largest  carrier  in  America?  It’s  just,  Are 
you for it, or are you against it, on a pure competitive—— 

Senator HUTCHISON. Mr. Swelbar? 
Mr. SWELBAR. I see the New York market as a little bit different. 
I’m  not  sure  that  the  New  York  model  is  a  perfect  model  in  any 
way. And that is, we have constrained capacity at each, LaGuardia 
and JFK. We’re certainly using fairly small airplanes in that avail-
able capacity. So, is it really being used as a—the available capac-
ity being used as efficiently as it could? I think what it is, that the 
inefficient  use  of  LaGuardia  and  JFK  could  arguably  be  said  to  be 
most helpful to Continental growing its Newark operation, and now 
with Newark being much more preferable to many of those working 
and living in downtown Manhattan. 

So, I mean, I think as we, discuss each of these metro areas with 
multiple  airports,  you  know,  there  are  nuances,  just  like  there  are 
nuances in Chicago and other metro areas.

Senator HUTCHISON. Anyone else? 
[No response.] 
Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  BURNS.  Well,  I’ve  got  two  questions,  and  then  I’m  going 

to wrap it up. 

Sam Coats, we’ve heard a lot of comparison to Houston as to the 
Dallas  market,  with  Hobby  and  International.  OK?  What’s  the  dif-
ference in the two markets? 

Mr.  COATS.  Well,  the  DFW  market  is  a  larger  market.  But  the 
difference  is  that  one’s  constrained  and  one’s  not.  I  was  a  Senior 
Vice  President  at  Continental  during  the  1993,  1994,  1995  time-
frame,  when  we  turned  it  around.  And  Southwest  was  over  at 
Hobby.  We  had  some  operations  at  Hobby.  But  the  thing  that  you 
find in the airline industry is, our responsibility as managers is to 
allocate  our  resources  to  earn  the  greatest  return  for  our  share-
holders.  If  it’s  in  American’s  interest  to  take  those  resources  to 
Love Field, you can bet they’ll be there in a New York minute. And 
if  it’s  not,  they  won’t.  And  it’s  my  belief  that  they  will  lower  fares 
at DFW, instead, where they have billions of dollars invested, that 
the pie will grow for everybody, just as it did in Houston, and that 
the consumer will be better off. 

As  the  gentleman,  Mr.  Campbell—Dr.  Campbell—said  a  minute 
ago,  the  policy  of  this  Nation  is  very  clear,  Senator.  It’s  one  of  de-
regulation and free competition. Now, do we believe in it, or do we 
not?  And  I  think  the  answer,  from  the  consumer’s  point  of  view, 
should  be  very  clear,  as  well,  that  you  ought  to  do  away  with  the 
Wright Amendment. 

Senator BURNS. Is there a compromise here? 
Mr.  COATS.  Yes,  sir.  And  that’s  what  the  Chamber  has  rec-
ommended. And that’s that you immediately do away with through- 
marketing, through-baggage, through-plane restrictions. Yesterday, 
I  came  to  Little  Rock  from  Dallas  Love  Field.  I  had  to  get  off  the 
plane. I didn’t check a bag, so I was able to get another ticket and 
get on another plane into Baltimore. I’ll have to do the same thing 
going  home,  unless  I  miss  my  flight,  and  I’ll  catch  a  nonstop  on 
American  to  DFW.  That  should  be  done  away  with  immediately. 
That is anti-consumer and it doesn’t pass the smell test. It is some-
thing  that  has  no  rational  justification  that  anybody  I  have  talked 
to can sustain. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Just  for  the  record,  I  did  want  to  point  out 
one  thing  that’s  different  between  the  Houston  situation  and  the 
Dallas/Fort  Worth  situation,  and  that  is—back  to  the  reason  that, 
really,  the  big  airport  was  forced  on  the  area—and  that  is  that 
you’ve  got  two  major  cities  in  the  region  with  DFW.  And  Houston 
is one metropolitan area. There are a lot of surrounding areas, but 
it’s  one  major  city.  We  have  two  major  cities,  in  Dallas  and  Fort 
Worth, in which one of those cities and the surrounding metropoli-
tan area, it would be severely inconvenienced if Love Field became 
a major hub that would take away from DFW’s service. 

Senator BURNS. Yes, sir? 
Mr. COATS. Senator Hutchison—— 
Senator  BURNS.  This  is  the  last  remark,  because  I’m  going  to  go 

to lunch. 

Mr. COATS. I don’t blame you at all, sir.

Love Field is physically constrained, Senator. 
Senator BURNS. Well, it has no—now, when—— 
Mr. COATS. Yes. 
Senator BURNS.—when I looked at Love Field, they have no way 

to—what’s their longest runway there? 

Mr.  COATS.  Their—I  think  it’s—I’m  not  sure.  The  folks  from 

Southwest would know, but I don’t know. 

Senator  BURNS.  What  is  it?  6,000  feet?  A  little  over  7,000?  Yes, 

OK. 

Mr. COATS. But there are two runways. There’s no way to expand 
either  one  of  those.  As  Ms.  Palmer  said,  they’re  limited  on  both 
sides.  The  Love  Field  master  plan  says  that  there  is  a  capability 
of  maybe  250  flights  a  day,  then  you  get  into  unacceptable  ground 
delays.  The  airport  is,  and  will  continue  to  be,  primarily  general 
aviation, and the 32-gate limitation is still in effect. 

I  think  it’s  up  to  the  city  to  manage  that  asset.  It’s  a  precious 
asset.  But  it  can’t  do  so  unless  Congress  gives  it  the  authority  to 
do so. 

Senator  BURNS.  OK.  We  want  to  thank  the  panels  today.  This 

has been a pretty spirited hearing. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator BURNS. Well attended. Happy birthday. 
[Whereupon, at 1:07 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing  this  morning 
to  discuss  what  I  believe  to  be  an  outdated  and  anti-competitive  measure  of  law— 
the  so-called  Wright  Amendment.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  today’s  witnesses  for 
their testimony. 

Our economy is market-driven and based on free and fair competition. When Con-
gress  deregulated  the  airline  industry  in  1978,  it  was  done  so  to  benefit  the  flying 
public;  to  give  them  choices  and  the  ability  to  have  markets—and  not  outside 
forces—direct  airfares  and  cities  served.  One  year  later,  a  restrictive  covenant  was 
placed  on  one  airport  in  particular  that  had  the  net  effect  of  reversing  airline  de-
regulation. 

As  my  colleagues  know,  the  Wright  Amendment  restricts  travel  into  and  out  of 
Dallas  Love  Field  for  commercial  flights  with  more  than  56  seats.  This  26  year  old 
law  originally  prohibited  travel  beyond  Texas’s  four  neighboring  states,  but  was 
amended  in  1997  to  allow  flights  from  Love  Field  to  Alabama,  Kansas  and  Mis-
sissippi. No other state may currently receive service from Love Field. 

Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  citizens  of  New  Hampshire  and  Northern  New  England 
who choose to fly Southwest Airlines, the Wright Amendment restricts their ability 
to fly to Dallas Love Field from Manchester Airport in my State of New Hampshire. 
Most  would  consider  a  federally-mandated  ‘‘service  area’’  anti-competitive  in  and 
of  itself,  but  the  Wright  Amendment  also  contains  marketing  restrictions  that  pro-
hibit Southwest from offering or advertising the availability of connecting flights be-
tween Love Field and any airport beyond the scope of the Wright Amendment. 

Because  of  these  ‘‘through  ticketing’’  restrictions,  a  customer  traveling  from  Love 
Field  cannot  purchase  a  ticket  from  Southwest  for  travel  beyond  any  point  within 
the Wright Amendment states, even if that customer is willing to make a stop first 
within one of the Wright Amendment states. To get to their final destination, a cus-
tomer would have to buy two tickets for two separate flights, and only if they were 
aware they could do so; a ticket agent could not inform them of that option by law. 
Mr. Chairman, it is inconceivable that after more than a quarter century of a de-
regulated airline industry, there is still one airport that is ‘‘locked up’’ for the major-
ity of the flying public purely for reasons of stifling competition. It can be only seen 
as a means to punish those airlines that would serve Love Field, and by extension, 
the  citizens  of  my  state  and  all  others  who  wish  to  fly  into  this  airport.  We  need 
to dismantle this grossly anti-competitive law, and it is my hope that Congress will 
quickly  pass  Senator  Ensign’s  bill,  S.  1424,  to  do  just  that.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-
man. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  unanimous  consent  to  enter  into  the  Record  an  op- 
ed to the New Hampshire Union Leader written by Mr. Kevin Dillon, Airport Direc-
tor of Manchester Airport regarding the Wright Amendment. 

The New Hampshire Union Leader (Manchester NH), November 10, 2005 

GRANITE STATERS SHOULD BE FREE TO FLY TO DALLAS 

by Kevin Dillon 

This morning at 10 the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Com-
mittee’s  Subcommittee  on  Aviation  will  conduct  a  hearing  in  Washington,  D.C.,  to 
discuss the future of the Wright Amendment, an antiquated, restrictive and unnec-
essary anti-free trade law enacted by the Federal Government in 1979 that prohibits 
Southwest Airlines from providing flights beyond the four states surrounding Texas 
from its corporate headquarters at Love Field (DAL) in Dallas, Texas. 

Many Southwest Airlines cities across the country are uniting in support of elimi-
nating  the  Wright  Amendment  with  the  hopes  of  increasing  convenient  one-stop

service opportunities for their air travelers and possibly the addition of new nonstop 
service to Dallas in the future. Manchester has joined the fight. 

Wright is wrong, and here’s why. 
The  Wright  Amendment  has  served  its  purpose.  When  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth, 
Texas,  began  planning  to  build  a  massive  new  airport,  Dallas/Ft.  Worth  Inter-
national  Airport  (DFW),  there  was  great  concern  that  airlines  would  be  reluctant 
to  leave  the  far  more  convenient  Dallas  Love  Field  (DAL)  and  move  further  away 
from  the  city  to  DFW.  American  Airlines  finally  agreed  to  move  its  operations  to 
DFW  in  exchange  for  a  Federal  law  that  prevented  any  airline  from  flying  out  of 
Dallas Love Field to anywhere outside the states bordering Texas. 

Twenty-six years later, DFW has become the fourth busiest airport in the country, 
serving  more  than  56  million  passengers  a  year.  Employing  the  ‘‘secondary  airport 
philosophy’’ that has made them (and Manchester Airport) so successful, Southwest 
doesn’t operate out of DFW, but chooses to operate out of DAL to keep its costs (and 
costs to passengers) low. 

The  Wright  Amendment  restricts  ‘‘free  trade,’’  is  anti-competition  and  affects  air 
service  at  Manchester  Airport.  Southwest  Airlines  is  Manchester  Airport’s  largest 
air carrier, offering 30 daily departures and providing service to more than 1.6 mil-
lion passengers each year. 

Unfortunately,  Southwest  is  not  permitted  to  offer  non-stop,  or  even  convenient 
one-stop,  service  to  Dallas  from  Manchester  Airport  because  of  this  antiquated,  re-
strictive and unnecessary law. The airline isn’t even allowed to advertise the avail-
ability of flights from DAL to destinations outside the scope of the Federal law. His-
torically, Dallas is a very popular destination for New Hampshire air travelers and 
among our top destinations. 

The aviation industry has changed dramatically in the past quarter century. Low 
cost  airlines  now  carry  over  30  percent  of  all  commercial  passengers  in  the  United 
States.  Bankruptcies,  consolidations  and  mergers  among  the  Nation’s  airlines  are 
increasing  as  they  all  fight  for  survival.  It’s  time  to  level  the  playing  field  among 
all airlines and repeal this antiquated anti-competition, anti-free trade law. It’s the 
‘‘RIGHT’’ thing to do. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOE I. LIEBERMAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT 

Thank  you  Chairman  Burns  and  Ranking  Member  Rockefeller  for  accepting  my 
testimony this morning in support of repeal of the Wright Amendment. I would also 
like  to  thank  Senator  Ensign  for  his  leadership  and  I  am  proud  to  be  a  co-sponsor 
of this bill. 

The  Wright  Amendment,  which  Congress  passed  in  1979,  limits  commercial  air 
travel to and from Dallas’ Love Field to destinations in just seven states—Alabama, 
Arkansas,  Kansas,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  New  Mexico  and  Oklahoma.  Passage  of 
the Amendment involved the balance of various local concerns and was done against 
the  backdrop  of  the  Airline  Deregulation  Act,  which  Congress  enacted  just  a  year 
before in 1978. 

Much has happened over the past 25 years, and the airline industry, for the most 
part,  has  embraced  deregulation.  We  have  seen  many  new  carriers  enter  the  mar-
ket,  some  successfully  and  some  not  so  successfully,  and  we  have  seen  many  merg-
ers, including the recent one between America West and US Airways. 

The  emergence  of  new  carriers  is  the  result  of  healthy  competition,  which  in  the 
end,  benefits  consumers.  Since  the  Airline  Deregulation  Act  was  passed  in  1978, 
fares  have  decreased,  according  to  inflation  adjusted  models,  and  carriers  have 
added hundreds of new routes. And today, more Americans are flying than ever be-
fore. 

One  of  the  success  stories  of  airline  deregulation  has  been  Southwest  Airlines, 
whose  impact  on  competition  and  lower  fares  has  created  what  is  known  in  the  in-
dustry as the ‘‘Southwest Effect,’’ which is when competition from a low-fare carrier 
drives down ticket prices, increases demand for air travel and, in turn, creates jobs 
in and around the affected areas. 

I  have  seen  the  ‘‘Southwest  Effect’’  first  hand  in  Hartford.  The  airline  initiated 
operations  at  Bradley  Field  in  October  1998  with  service  to  four  cities—Baltimore, 
Chicago,  Nashville,  and  Orlando—with  12  daily  flights.  Today,  Southwest  serves  7 
cities—with  the  additions  of  Tampa  Bay,  Philadelphia  and  Las  Vegas  over  the  last 
several  years—and  has  25  daily  departures.  The  result  has  been  terrific  for  Con-
necticut  consumers.  Since  Southwest  Airlines  started  service,  the  average  one-way 
ticket  price  has  decreased  by  23  percent  and  the  overall  number  of  passengers  has 
increased by 20 percent. In addition, the increase in passengers has created jobs in 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

103 

and around the Hartford area. In fact, one study by the Connecticut Center for Eco-
nomic Analysis concluded that 2.23 jobs are created for every 1,000 new passengers 
who use the airport. 

I  recognize  that  there  were  unique  circumstances  involving  a  host  of  local  con-
cerns surrounding the passage of the Wright Amendment in 1979. And I understand 
that  some  of  those  concerns  may  even  still  exist  today.  However,  after  more  than 
25  years  of  witnessing  and  experiencing  the  benefits  of  competition  in  the  airline 
industry,  I  believe  it  is  time  for  Congress  to  look  at  the  empirical  evidence  before 
us—that  competition  benefits  consumers—and  repeal  this  artificial  barrier  to  com-
petition. 

What  I  have  seen  happen  in  Hartford  and  what  is  happening  in  Dallas  on  the 
routes  that  Southwest  can  serve  from  Love  Field  under  the  Wright  Amendment 
should be allowed to take place based on market needs. 

Chairman  Burns  and  Ranking  Member  Rockefeller—thank  you  again  for  accept-
ing  my  statement  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  your  Committee  to 
move this legislation forward. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOE BARTON, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS 
The  debate  over  changing  current  laws  regarding  Love  Field  in  Dallas,  Texas  is 
not  a  new  debate.  What  is  being  seen  is  a  false  appeal  to  consumer  emotion  with 
pithy  phrases  such  as  ‘‘Wright  is  Wrong’’  and  ‘‘Set  Love  Free.’’  It  would  be  easy  to 
simply  accept  this  three-word  argument  as  the  sum-all  explanation  for  a  complex, 
local  issue,  but  consumers  and  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  economy  deserve  more  from 
their elected officials. 

Senators,  I  urge  you  to  begin  your  analysis  of  this  debate  by  agreeing  with  me 
what  our  motivation  should  be:  providing  dependable,  competitive  airline  prices  for 
commuters  to  and  from  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area.  I  disagree  that  the  repeal  of 
the Wright Amendment is the most effective way to accomplish this goal. 

Both  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area  and  Southwest  Airlines  owe  a  large  portion  of 
their corporate success to the enactment of the Wright Amendment. The city limits 
and suburbs of Dallas and Fort Worth were growing closer together in the time be-
fore  DFW  Airport.  The  need  was  realized  to  combine  their  resources  for  a  joint 
project  that  would  bring  bigger  business  and  success  to  the  region.  Through  Joint 
Bond  Ordinances,  the  cities  agreed  to  ‘‘provide  for  orderly,  efficient,  and  effective 
phase  out  at  Love  Field,  Red  Bird,  GSIA  and  Meacham  Field,’’  multiple  airports 
that  scattered  the  efforts  of  centralized  transportation.  These  bonds  specifically 
called  for  the  transfer  of  all  ‘‘Certificated  Air  Carrier  Services’’  to  move  to  the  new 
regional airport, DFW International. Court rulings allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 
intrastate in Texas as they were not a Certificated Carrier. Love Field consequently 
remained open to flights. 

From 1973 to 1978, Southwest Airlines was content with this arrangement, using 
it to grow the size of its company. However, in 1979, Southwest called for the ability 
to  fly  interstate  outside  of  the  State  of  Texas.  Both  the  City  of  Dallas  and  the  City 
of  Fort  Worth,  along  with  DFW  International,  disagreed  with  the  need  for  this 
change.  A  compromise  was  reached  at  the  Federal  level  with  the  Wright  Amend-
ment. 

Contrary  to  current  propaganda,  Love  Field  and  Southwest  Airlines  are  not  vic-
tims  of  a  plot  to  restrain  their  growth  and  flight  services.  In  fact,  the  Wright 
Amendment  is  largely  responsible  for  giving  Southwest  the  traction  to  gain  and 
grow  their  company’s  success.  Southwest  was  able  to  use  this  agreement  to  carve 
out  a  niche  market  in  short-haul  flights.  The  Department  of  Transportation  was 
urged by Southwest attorneys Paul Seligson and Robert Kneisley in 1985 to respect 
the ‘‘Congressional declaration that in this one instance, competition should be lim-
ited  to  carriers  which  emphasize  short-haul,  turnaround  service  and  which  restrict 
their  size  by  refraining  from  interlining  anyone  on  their  systems.’’  For  the  past  26 
years,  Southwest  has  fought  to  protect  this  amendment  and  even  used  it  to  keep 
other  interests  out  of  Love  Field.  Now  as  they  look  to  slant  the  situation  in  their 
favor,  they  frame  the  compromise  as  a  strain  on  their  business  model,  a  violation 
of the free market, and the cause for higher ticket prices in the region. 

I  am  strongly  supportive  of  maintaining  a  free-market  economy  in  the  industries 
of  our  country.  Competition  helps  consumers  through  a  decrease  in  prices  and  an 
increase in customer service and quality of work. Our focus to this end must be pro-
viding for competing airlines, not competing airports. 

This  is  why  the  best  course  of  action  is  for  Southwest  Airlines  to  join  other  air-
lines  on  a  level  playing  field  at  DFW  International  Airport.  They  should  recognize 
the  boundaries  of  the  compromise  that  they  have,  to  this  point,  agreed  with  and

commence with interstate flights from DFW. Five low-cost carriers, such as AirTran 
and ATA, already carry flights out of DFW and compete directly with larger compa-
nies  on  major  routes.  This  airline-to-airline  competition  from  the  same  location  has 
helped to drive fares lower. DFW Airport has welcomed Southwest Airlines with in-
credible  incentive  packages  and  empty  gates  would  allow  them  to  start  flights  im-
mediately. 

The local economy of Dallas and Fort Worth has grown as a result of the Wright 
Amendment  and  a  strong,  federally-supported  DFW  Airport.  Decisions  have  been 
made  in  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area  directly  related  to  the  binding  and  irrevocable 
terms  of  this  agreement.  The  investments  on  businesses  and  improvements  in  the 
area  would  not  have  been  made  without  the  understanding  that  DFW  had  been 
dubbed  the  primary  airport  in  the  area.  DFW  Airport  is  more  than  just  another 
local business. It is an economic engine that generates more than $14 billion in an-
nual economic activity for North Texas. It supports more than 200,000 full-time jobs 
and serves as a key component in international business and tourism for the entire 
area. The decision for repeal of the Wright Amendment cannot be made on the basis 
of  interests  outside  of  the  Dallas/Fort  Worth  area.  Too  many  local  residents  and 
business  owners  count  on  its  existence  to  continue  to  provide  their  stable  economy. 
Repeal  of  this  legislation  will  cause  a  decrease  or  removal  of  flights  from  smaller 
markets  that  benefit  from  the  hub  system  of  DFW  Airport.  Currently,  19.3  million 
local  domestic  origin  and  destination  passengers  travel  out  of  DFW.  Additionally, 
DFW  Airport  provides  travel  for  32.1  million  connecting  domestic  travelers.  This 
hub-and-spoke  system  of  providing  incoming  passengers  with  connection  to  another 
leg of their flight will be greatly threatened by a repeal of the Wright Amendment. 
A study by Simat, Helliesen & Eichner, Inc., an international air transport consult-
ant, showed that fewer passengers to support flights will cause some markets to be 
dropped  entirely,  specifically  naming  possible  closures  as  Greenville/Spartanburg, 
Savannah, Mobile, Green Bay, Madison and others. 

Continued  encouragement  of  low-cost  carrier  competition  at  DFW  will  allow  a 
growing  international  hub  to  provide  for  both  local  and  connecting  passengers. 
Southwest  should  agree  to  unrestricted  competition  and  a  level  playing  field  by  es-
tablishing  flights  from  DFW  Airport.  We  should  all  be  in  favor  of  keeping  the  Dal-
las/Fort  Worth  International  Airport  strong,  as  this  venue  will  provide  the  most 
flights for consumers. The local compromise should remain intact. 
Thank you for allowing me to testify on this important matter. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. KENNY MARCHANT, 

U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM TEXAS 

Mr.  Chairman,  members  of  the  Subcommittee  and  guests,  thank  you  for  the  op-
portunity  to  testify  today  on  this  most  important  subject.  I  represent  the  24th  Dis-
trict in Texas, which is where Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is lo-
cated. DFW Airport is the economic pipeline of the North Texas Region; it generates 
more than 268,000 jobs. Any change in the Wright Amendment would directly affect 
my  constituents  in  a  profound  way.  As  you  all  know,  the  Wright  Amendment  is  a 
very contentious issue in North Texas, and one which I hope I can shed a little light 
on  today.  I  cannot  do  this  through  any  quick  sound  bites  or  catchy  slogans.  To  ex-
plain  my  position  fully,  one  must  take  a  historical  perspective  and  go  back  to  the 
beginning  of  it  all.  I  am  talking  about  when  the  concept  of  DFW  Airport  was  first 
being  planned.  Those  on  the  side  of  Love  Field  and  Southwest  say  they  feel  a  com-
promise is needed. Hopefully at the end of my testimony, I will successfully explain 
why  the  Wright  Amendment  is  the  compromise,  and  no  additional  changes  to  the 
law should be made. 

In the early 1960s, the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth had the foresight to recog-
nize that centralizing the fragmented air service between the two burgeoning cities 
into  one  regional  airport  would  bring  unprecedented  growth  and  prosperity  to  the 
area. In addition, it was recognized that the only way this new airport would thrive 
was  if  all  airlines  involved  agreed  to  discontinue  service  out  of  Meachem  Field  in 
Ft. Worth and Love Field in Dallas and move their operations to the new DFW Air-
port. Every airline at both airports agreed to do this except one, Southwest Airlines. 
Southwest’s  refusal  to  move  to  the  new  centralized  airport  led  to  a  long  series  of 
expensive  lawsuits.  Because  of  language  in  the  bond  ordinance  created  to  finance 
construction  of  the  airport,  Southwest  claimed  it  was  not  required  to  move  from 
Love  Field  to  DFW  Airport  because,  unlike  all  the  other  airlines  serving  the  two 
cities at the time, it was only an intrastate carrier. Throughout this protracted legal 
battle, Southwest continued to offer intrastate service from Love Field.

Following the deregulation of the airline industry by Congress in 1978, Southwest 
applied to offer interstate service from Love Field to New Orleans. This, unlike the 
earlier  instance,  was  a  clear  violation  of  the  bond  ordinance.  In  order  to  head  off 
another  round  of  legal  battles,  Congressman  Jim  Wright  stepped  in  to  present  a 
compromise  in  1979.  This  compromise,  also  known  as  the  Wright  Amendment,  was 
intended to once and for all put an end to the legal battles between Southwest Air-
lines,  the  City  of  Dallas,  the  City  of  Fort  Worth  and  the  DFW  Airport  Board.  The 
law  allowed  Love  Field  to  stay  open  only  so  long  as  service  would  be  limited  to 
intrastate  service  within  Texas  and  interstate  service  to  the  contiguous  states.  All 
parties signed off on it and it was codified into Federal law. 

For  over  a  quarter  century,  this  issue  was  laid  to  rest.  All  parties  involved  were 
satisfied  and  everyone  benefited.  The  only  change  in  the  law  was  in  1998  when 
three  additional  states  were  added  to  the  Wright  Amendment  by  the  ‘‘Shelby 
Amendment.’’  Now  Southwest  has  decided  that  enough  time  has  passed  for  people 
to  forget  the  original  reason  for  this  law,  and  to  declare  the  Wright  Amendment  to 
be ‘‘anti-competitive.’’ 

It is clear that the fight over the Wright Amendment is going to continue as long 
as  Southwest  remains  at  Love  Field.  The  answer  to  this  problem  is  simple  and  re-
quires  no  change  in  Federal  law:  Southwest  should  move  its  operations  from  Love 
Field to DFW Airport. Due to the departure of Delta last winter, there are 24 open 
gates at DFW. Southwest could avoid a bitter fight over the Wright Amendment and 
take these gates at any time. In addition, to help cover the cost of moving their op-
erations, DFW Airport has offered one year in free rent and additional financial in-
centives to any air carrier valued in excess of $22 million to take those gates. Unfor-
tunately, Southwest has repeatedly declined this offer. 

I  would  also  like  to  point  out  the  irony  in  the  choice  consciously  made  by  South-
west  to  remain  in  an  airport  with  limited  operations  and  then  complain  about  it. 
They  have  had  innumerable  chances  to  do  what  is  right  and  move  their  operations 
to  DFW  Airport,  but  instead  have  chosen  the  route  of  legal  action.  There  has  been 
no better time to change this pattern of behavior than now. I plead with Southwest 
to  take  the  financial  incentives  package  from  DFW  Airport  and  move  their  oper-
ations there. 

As  you  can  see,  the  compromise  Southwest  is  requesting  has  already  been  made, 
and  it  is  called  the  Wright  Amendment.  Thousands  upon  thousands  of  jobs  in  the 
region generated by DFW Airport hang in the balance. Any modification to this law 
could  have  a  disastrous  effect  on  the  regional  economy  as  a  whole.  It  is  time  for 
Southwest  to  make  the  move  to  DFW  Airport.  They  will  be  welcomed  with  open 
arms. 

Thank you for your time. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU TO 

HERBERT D. KELLEHER 

Question.  There  has  been  some  disagreement  over  whether  or  not  Southwest 

‘‘agreed’’ to the terms of the Wright Amendment back in 1979. 

Mr.  Kelleher,  could  you  provide  some  background  and  extrapolate  on  what  the 
terms  of  this  agreement  were  at  the  time?  Were  there  true  ‘‘negotiations’’  over  the 
language of the amendment to which you were a party? 

Answer.  Defenders  of  the  Wright  Amendment  claim  that  it  was  a  ‘‘compromise’’ 
that  even  ‘‘benefited’’  Southwest.  The  ‘‘benefit’’  to  Southwest  is  that,  although  the 
Amendment was intended to punish Southwest and cause it severe economic injury, 
Southwest’s  employees  managed  to  make  the  carrier  a  success  despite  the  Wright 
Amendment. 

The  proof  of  the  DFW  Parties  anti-competitive  intent  may  be  found  not  only  in 
the  well-known  geographical  restrictions  which  limit  where  a  plane  can  be  flown, 
but in the more obscure ‘‘marketing and through ticketing’’ restrictions that are less 
well-understood.  These  restrictions  are  a  blatant  restraint  on  commercial  free 
speech  and  force  Southwest,  unintentionally,  to  deceive  and  confuse  passengers. 
They  are  without  precedent  in  commercial  aviation,  including  during  the  regulated 
era. 

Under  the  Wright  Amendment,  Southwest  cannot  ‘‘offer  or  provide  any  through 
service . . .’’  and  cannot  ‘‘offer  for  sale  transportation  to  or  from . . . any  point 
which  is  outside’’  the  so-called  Wright  Amendment  states.  This  means  that  even  if 
a  customer  is  willing  to  make  a  stop  within  the  permitted  states  and  continue  his 
or her journey on the same plane, or even a different plane, Southwest may not offer 
or market such service.

An  example:  Southwest  flies  from  Dallas  to  Little  Rock  and  from  Little  Rock  to 
Baltimore-Washington  International  (BWI).  But  Southwest  cannot  sell  a  single 
through-ticket  to  a  customer  going  from  Dallas  to  BWI  who  is  willing  to  make  a 
connection to another plane in Little Rock. 

Another  example:  Southwest  has  a  plane  that  goes  from  Dallas  to  Albuquerque, 
where it sits for 25 minutes before continuing on to Las Vegas. But Southwest can-
not  sell  a  ticket  to  someone  going  from  Dallas  to  Las  Vegas  with  a  stop  in  Albu-
querque. That someone has to get off the airplane in Albuquerque. 

In contrast, Members of Congress are familiar with the perimeter rule that limits 
the distance of nonstop flights from Reagan National. But a Member may purchase 
a  ticket  to  destinations  beyond  the  nonstop  perimeter  and  take  a  one-stop  flight  on 
the same airplane to these destinations. (Interestingly, the perimeter rule at Reagan 
National  originally  was  much  more  restricted.  It  was  expanded  as  the  result  of  ag-
gressive  lobbying  by  DFW  and  American  Airlines—with  an  assist  from  Leader 
Wright—to  permit  American  Airlines  to  fly  to  DFW  from  Reagan  National.  Appar-
ently, the DFW Parties’ views on airport restrictions are quite selective.) 

The  marketing  and  through  ticketing  restrictions  of  the  Wright  Amendment  are, 
in  and  of  themselves,  an  unreasonable  restraint  of  trade  and  were  totally  unneces-
sary  to  protect  DFW  in  its  alleged  ‘‘infancy.’’  They  were  put  in  not  just  to  protect 
DFW or the DFW air carriers, but to make it economically impossible for Southwest 
to  survive  at  Love  Field.  The  fact  that  Southwest  Airlines  managed  to  survive  in 
spite  of  the  restrictions  does  not  validate  them.  Southwest  fought  against  the 
Wright  Amendment  in  all  its  forms,  including  the  final  version.  No  ‘‘compromise’’ 
would  have  ever  been  accepted  voluntarily  which  included  such  goofy  and  onerous 
burdens  on  flight  operations  and  Customer  Service.  The  Wright  Amendment  came 
to  be  because  the  DFW  Parties  and  Leader  Jim  Wright  had  the  power  to  pass  it 
and Southwest was powerless to stop it. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

HERBERT D. KELLEHER 

Question.  Very  recently,  Southwest  Airlines  proposed  to  move  from  SEA/TAC  to 
close-in  Boeing  Field  and,  quite  frankly,  created  an  uproar  in  the  community  be-
cause  of  the  significant  investment  that  has  been  made  over  the  years  into  SEA/ 
TAC.  Seattle’s  community  leaders,  in  the  end,  chose  to  protect  their  investment  at 
SEA/TAC  and  not  allow  Boeing  Field  to  be  opened  up  for  one  company’s  benefit. 
Isn’t  what  you  are  asking  the  Congress  to  do  here  the  exact  same  thing  that  you 
were  told  ‘‘no’’  to  by  Seattle?  Aren’t  you  really  asking  Congress  to  undo  decisions 
made  in  the  past  regarding  investment  in  DFW  Airport  and  in  effect  shift  major 
infrastructure  dollars  away  from  an  international  hub  airport  to  an  inferior  but 
close-in  airport  because  at  this  point  in  time,  after  years  of  ‘‘passionate  neutrality’’ 
on the subject, it appears to be in your company’s interest? 

Answer.  You  and  I  view  Southwest’s  recent  Boeing  Field  proposal  in  starkly  dif-
ferent terms. Southwest Airlines proposed to invest $130 million of its own financial 
resources  to  improve  King  County  International  Airport  (commonly  referred  to  as 
Boeing Field). Under our proposal, King County would have ultimately taken owner-
ship  of  the  facility  we  proposed  to  construct—again,  at  our  expense.  We  proposed 
to give King County a $130 million airport and, by doing so, preserve low fares and 
competition for the people of the Puget Sound Region. As a result of estimated direct 
expenditures, taxes paid, and the preservation of low fares, we projected that there 
would have been a $1.6 billion total economic gain to the region. 

Keep  in  mind,  too,  that  Southwest  Airlines  has  the  largest  all-jet  fleet  in  the 
world,  flying  only  Boeing  737s.  We  know  how  important  the  Boeing  Company  is  to 
the  economy  and  people  of  Washington  State.  We  are  among  Boeing’s  most  loyal 
and, I dare say, most important customers. 

Would  it  have  been  in  the  interests  of  Southwest  to  move  its  Seattle  operations 
to  Boeing  Field,  as  we  proposed  to  do?  Of  course . . . that’s  why  we  advanced  the 
proposal.  Southwest  Airlines  cannot  afford  to  operate  its  successful  business  model 
and  preserve  low  fares  for  consumers  at  very  high-cost  airports  such  as  Sea-Tac. 
That  is  why  we  looked  for  alternatives  that  would  preserve  our  commitment  and 
investment in the Seattle market. After more than five years of articulated concerns 
regarding  blatant  airport  mismanagement  and  increasing  costs  at  Sea-Tac,  South-
west looked to Boeing Field as a viable alternative. 

We offered our proposal to several community and business leaders, including the 
King County Executive. The response was overwhelmingly favorable and Southwest 
was encouraged to proceed with the proposal. After word leaked out, an enormously 
expensive  lobbying  and  negative  attack  campaign  was  mounted  by  self-serving  spe-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

107 

cial interests which stood to benefit by restraining competition. Southwest chose not 
to respond to the attacks. 

Again,  the  proposal  was  very  good,  from  an  economic  standpoint,  for  the  Puget 
Sound  Region.  But  if,  for  whatever  reason,  it  was  not  wanted,  we  had  no  interest 
in  proceeding.  Frankly,  we  have  too  many  other  options  to  waste  time  and  money 
responding  to  such  misguided  and  selfish  attacks.  The  negative  political  campaign 
ultimately  caused  the  King  County  Executive,  up  for  reelection,  to  withdraw  his 
public support. Without his support, it was pointless to proceed and Southwest abid-
ed by the decision. 

With  respect  to  the  Wright  Amendment,  we  are  asking  Congress  to  strike  down 
an irrational and indefensible law which it adopted 26 years ago as the culmination 
of  more  than  a  decade  of  anti-competitive  legal  harassment  of  Southwest  Airlines. 
To  be  sure,  it  would  be  in  Southwest’s  interest  if  Congress  were  to  repeal  the  law. 
Likewise,  it  is  in  the  interest  of  the  countless  consumers  nationwide  who  are  held 
hostage  by  high  airfares  resulting  from  a  lack  of  competition  in  the  Dallas  market. 
Like  the  opposition  to  Boeing  Field,  the  forces  seeking  to  preserve  the  status  quo 
on  the  Wright  Amendment  do  so  because  it  lines  their  pockets  at  the  expense  of 
consumers. In effect, the Wright Amendment, like the high cost of operating at Sea- 
Tac, is a hidden and shameful tax on consumers. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU TO 

KEVIN COX 

Question  1.  Mr.  Cox,  with  or  without  a  Wright  Amendment,  what  benefit  do  you 
see  in  Love  Field  remaining  open  for  scheduled  passenger  service?  For  DFW?  For 
the Dallas metropolitan area? 

Answer. At the outset, I think it is important to understand that the Federal Gov-
ernment back in the early 1960’s urged the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth to come 
together  to  focus  on  the  creation  of  one  regional  airport.  The  fact  is  that  for  many 
years, the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth were engaged in an intense and counter-
productive  rivalry  for  the  business  of  commercial  aviation  and  commercial  air  car-
riers.  While  the  City  of  Dallas  was  enlarging  and  improving  Love  Field,  the  City 
of  Fort  Worth  constructed  Greater  Southwest  International  Airport  (GSIA).  As  re-
counted  in  1973  by  Chief  Justice  William  M.  Taylor  of  the  U.S.  District  Court  for 
the  Northern  District  of  Texas,  ‘‘serving  two  airports  which  were  so  close  together 
resulted  in  unnecessary  expense  to  the  carriers  as  well  as  the  taxpayers  and  inad-
equate and incomplete air service to both cities.’’ 

Recognizing  this  inefficiency,  the  Federal  Government’s  Civil  Aeronautics  Board 
(CAB) instituted in August 1962, an investigation known as the Dallas/Fort Worth, 
Texas  Regional  Airport  Investigation—docket  number  13959.  This  investigation  fo-
cused on the sole issue of whether the Certificate of Public Convenience and Neces-
sity  of  interstate  airlines  under  the  CAB’s  jurisdiction  should  be  amended  so  as  to 
designate a specific airport as a single point through which all interstate air carrier 
service  to  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  must  be  provided.  After  numerous  hearings,  the 
CAB  in  1964  entered  an  interim  order  giving  the  two  cities  a  period  of  180  days 
in which to arrive at a voluntary agreement to designate the single airport through 
which the CAB regulated carriers would service the Dallas/Fort Worth area. In this 
order,  the  CAB  went  on  to  indicate  that  if  the  parties  were  unable  to  agree  on  a 
single  airport  to  serve  the  area,  then  the  CAB  would  have  no  choice  but  to  make 
the determination for the two cities. 

Given  this  impending  designation,  the  cities  of  Dallas  and  Fort  Worth  agreed  to 
set  aside  their  differences  and  united  to  design,  finance,  and  construct  a  new  re-
gional  airport.  This  airport  was  to  be  located  mid-way  between  the  cities  of  Dallas 
and  Fort  Worth.  On  November  2.  1968,  the  City  of  Dallas  and  the  City  of  Fort 
Worth  adopted  by  agreement  the  1968  Regional  Airport  Concurrent  Bond  Ordi-
nance. This bond ordinance served then, as it does today, as the vehicle upon which 
all revenue bonds are issued. Section 9.5(A) of the bond ordinance provides, in perti-
nent part, that the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth ‘‘hereby covenant and agree that 
from  and  after  the  effective  date  of  this  Ordinance,  shall  take  such  steps  as  may 
be necessary, appropriate and legally permissible . . . to provide for the orderly, ef-
ficient  and  effective  phase-out  at  Love  Field,  Red  Bird,  GSIA  and  Meacham  Field, 
of any and all Certificated Air Carrier Services, and to transfer such activity to the 
Regional Airport effective upon the beginning of operations at the Regional Airport.’’ 
With  that  as  a  backdrop,  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  the  only  reason  Love  Field 
remains  open  today  is  because  of  a  political  compromise  known  as  the  Wright 
Amendment.  As  stated  in  the  legislative  history,  all  parties  agreed  to  this  com-
promise.  DFW  is  on  record  supporting  this  compromise  which  allows  Love  Field  to 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

108 

serve as a short haul airport. If however, this compromise is going to be undermined 
or actually repealed as Southwest Airlines has requested, then I believe it behooves 
everyone  to  reassess  the  need,  purpose  and  benefit  of  Love  Field  given  the  original 
agreement,  the  outstanding  bond  covenants,  and  the  capacity  that  exists  at  DFW 
International  Airport.  The  fact  is  that  DFW  Airport  has  more  than  sufficient  space 
to  accommodate  any  and  all  long  haul  traffic  that  Southwest  Airlines  or  any  other 
airlines desires to initiate now and in the reasonable future. 

Question  2.  Enplanement  data  for  DFW  shows  a  growth  rate  of  more  than  12.3 
percent  from  2003  to  2004  while  Love  Field  had  a  change  of  5.3  percent.  In  terms 
of  boardings,  DEW  ranked  fourth  in  2004  and  Love  Field  ranked  56th.  Origin  and 
Destination  (O&D)  data  shows  that  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  was  the  8th 
largest ‘‘destination of choice’’ in the United States last year. According to this data, 
it  would  appear  that  Dallas/Fort  Worth  International  is  a  tremendous  force  in  the 
marketplace.  Does  DFW  feel  that  these  numbers  will  ‘‘slip’’  if  the  Wright  Amend-
ment is repealed? 

Answer.  Absolutely,  they  will  more  than  slip—there  will  be  a  substantial  impact 
if Love Field is completely reopened. An SH&E study recently focused upon the im-
pact  to  DFW  Airport  if  the  Wright  Amendment  were  repealed.  Given  the  projected 
growth  at  Love  Field,  SH&E  concluded  that  DFW  will  lose  a  substantial  amount 
of traffic. In fact, SH&E predicts that DFW could lose as many as 408 daily flights, 
or  20  percent  of  DFW’s  current  operations,  and  as  many  as  21  million  passengers 
annually,  representing  a  35  percent  decline  from  current  levels.  With  this  substan-
tial  loss,  DFW  Airport  passenger  levels  will  decrease  to  levels  seen  20  years  ago, 
and it will take another 19 years for traffic just to recover to current levels. 

In  short,  repealing  the  Wright  Amendment  will  amount  to  a  39  year  penalty  for 
DFW International Airport, the traveling community and businesses that have come 
to  rely  on  DFW’s  economic  vitality,  and  the  airlines  which  moved  to  DFW  in  reli-
ance upon the closure of Love Field. Equally, if not more important, will be the un-
told  impact  on  the  lives  of  the  268,500  men  and  women  who  have  their  jobs  tied 
to DFW Airport. 

Having just added $2.7 billion in new debt, while facing the prospect of losing 21 
million  passengers,  408  daily  flights.  and  a  significant  number  of  domestic  and 
international  destinations,  DFW  Airport  would  be  under  financial  stress  at  a  time 
when  it  is  least  equipped  to  handle  it.  As  an  example.  if  the  Wright  Amendment 
is repealed, it is conservatively estimated that 35 gates would sit empty and unused. 
To put that in perspective, Indianapolis International Airport has 35 gates in total, 
Mineta San Jose´ International Airport has 32 gates, San Antonio International Air-
port  has  28  gates,  and  Austin-Bergstrom  International  Airport  has  25  gates.  DFW 
would  have  vacant  and  idle  the  rough  equivalent  of  the  total  number  of  gates  at 
each of these airports. 

The  fact  is  that  it  has  already  begun  to  occur.  When  Congress  recently  extended 
the Wright Amendment to permit service from Love Field to Missouri, American an-
nounced that it had no choice but to compete with Southwest Airlines at Love Field. 
Recently,  American  Airlines  announced  that  it  will  add  16  daily  departures  to  four 
cities from Dallas Love Field. Starting in March, American will initiate service from 
Love Field to St. Louis, Kansas City, Austin, and San Antonio. 

As  a  result  of  its  entry  into  Love  Field,  American  Airlines  also  announced  that 
it  would  eliminate  certain  service  at  DFW.  In  particular,  American  Airlines  will 
eliminate North Texas service to five domestic cities: Long Beach, Calif; Providence, 
R.I.;  Green  Bay,  Wis.;  Toledo,  Ohio;  and  Rochester,  Minn.  American  Airlines  will 
also  eliminate  North  Texas  service  to  a  vital  Latin  American  market,  Lima,  Peru. 
Additionally, American Airlines will also reduce service levels to key Texas cities in-
cluding  Austin,  San  Antonio,  College  Station  and  Tyler,  as  well  as  fewer  flights  to 
St. Louis, Kansas City and Cincinnati. In total, American Airlines will cut or elimi-
nate  service  to  13  destinations  and  in  doing  so  will  eliminate  a  total  of  31  flights 
from DFW. 

Obviously,  this  reduction  in  service  hurts  residents  and  businesses  in  those  af-
fected  cities  and  hurts  our  citizens,  local  businesses  and  concessionaires  right  here 
in  North  Texas.  As  flights  are  lost,  there  is  a  similar  ripple  effect  among  pilots, 
flight attendants, fuelers and others among the 268,000 men and women whose jobs 
are tied to DFW. 

In short, this should serve as a solemn and ominous warning for those who would 
seek  to  re-open  Love  Field  to  additional  long  haul  service—there  are  very  real  and 
serious economic consequences for all of North Texas. 

The  sad  fact  is  that  Southwest  Airlines  could  have  avoided  the  negative  impact 
on our community, neighborhoods and economy by simply choosing to offer long-haul 
flights  from  DFW  while  keeping  its  current  service  at  Dallas  Love  Field.  DFW  will 
continue  to  urge  Southwest  Airlines  to  accept  our  standing  offer  of  free  terminal 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  14:44 Dec 14, 2010 Jkt 062992 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\62992.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

rent  and  $22  million  in  incentives  to  begin  flights  here—the  gates  are  ready  and 
waiting. We at DFW want to strengthen the North Texas economy for all of our citi-
zens, not see it degraded for the financial benefit of one company. 

Question 3. It has been stated that DFW is ready to offer Southwest Airlines what 
would amount to a $22 million benefit if the airline was to move to DFW Are there 
similar  ‘‘benefits’’  that  DFW  offers  or  has  offered  to  other  airlines  to  entice  them 
to either move to or stay at DFW? 

Answer.  In  the  face  of  Delta  Air  Lines’  elimination  of  its  hub,  DFW  Airport  has 
been  aggressively  targeting  both  new  carriers  and  existing  carriers  to  backfill  the 
service  lost  as  a  result  of  Delta’s  decision.  In  fact,  virtually  every  low-cost  airline 
has  been  approached  by  DFW  Airport,  with  Southwest  Airlines  on  the  top  of  that 
list. The same offer has been offered to many other carriers that might be interested 
in backfilling the gates left vacant by Delta Air Lines. Unfortunately, no carrier has 
accepted  our  offer  due  in  large  part  to  the  uncertainty  of  whether  Love  Field  will 
be re-opened for long-haul service. The fact is that no carrier, at least at this point, 
is  willing  to  commit  to  a  major  expansion  at  DFW  Airport  and  accept  our  offer  as 
long as there is a chance that Love Field may be re-opened.

Dear Senator Hutchison: 

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR 
Laredo, TX, July 25, 2005 

For  months,  there  have  been  discussions  in  North  Texas  about  the  repeal  of  the 
Wright Amendment. Newspaper articles appear weekly on this topic and the ability 
of  Southwest  Airlines  to  do  business  in  other  states  restricted  under  the  Wright 
Amendment. 

These  articles  concentrate  on  the  effects  a  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  will 
have on the Dallas metropolitan area. What has not been discussed is the economic 
impact  the  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  may  have  on  communities  with  re-
gional airports that have American Airlines flying to/from DFW Airport. 

The  City  of  Laredo  requests  that  you  oppose  any  legislation  that  seeks  to  repeal 
the Wright Amendment. At present time, there are five American Airline flights de-
parting  daily  to  DFW  airport  with  continued  travel  to  destinations  throughout  the 
United States. If American Airlines moved planes into Love Field to be competitive 
with  Southwest  Airlines,  it  could  harm  air  service  to  many  regional  airports  that 
work  with  American  Airlines.  Smaller  regional  airports,  like  Laredo,  could  see 
American  Airlines  forced  to  have  fewer  flights  and  smaller,  slower  and  less  secure 
aircrafts serving our city. 

American  Airlines  has  been  a  terrific  partner  with  the  City  of  Laredo  and  our 
community  wishes  to  continue  this  successful  relationship.  DFW  needs  to  continue 
to be a strong hub airport. This will ensure that regional airports, such as Laredo’s, 
continue  to  meet  the  travel  needs  of  its  citizens.  We  ask  that  the  debates  include 
the  economic  impact  any  change  to  the  Wright  Amendment  may  have  on  all  of 
Texas  not  just  on  Love  Field.  Thank  you  for  your  continued  leadership  on  behalf 
of the citizens of Laredo. 

Sincerely, 

ELIZABETH G. FLORES, 

Mayor, City of Laredo.

Dear Senator Bond: 

I am aware that a hearing has been scheduled on November 10 before the Senate 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation pertaining to the 
Wright  Amendment  and  certain  restrictions  on  commercial  airline  flights  operating 
out  of  Love  Field  in  Dallas.  The  purpose  of  this  letter  is  to  support  the  creation  of 
an  additional  exception  to  the  Amendment  that  would  allow  direct  flights  between 
Missouri and Love Field.

While I understand that there are many viewpoints concerning the rationale and 
effect  of  the  Wright  Amendment  in  general,  I  write  today  to  express  Anheuser- 
Busch’s specific desire for the ability to fly direct between Missouri and Love Field. 
While  Anheuser-Busch  has  its  headquarters,  a  brewery  and  many  employees  in  St. 
Louis,  it  also  has  many  facilities,  personnel  and  business  interests  in  Texas.  Flexi-
bility  and  competitive  pricing  in  travel  between  St.  Louis  and  Dallas  is  therefore 
very important to the company. The addition of an exception for Missouri within the 
Wright Amendment would accomplish this goal. 

As  a  major  St.  Louis  corporation,  Anheuser-Busch  also  recognizes  the  potential 
economic  impact  of  additional  flights  and  passengers  traveling  between  Dallas  and 
Missouri airports. Increased passenger traffic and the associated local travel spend-
ing would certainly benefit the St. Louis region. Missouri residents would also ben-
efit  from  additional  choices  and  competitive  rates  in  traveling  to  and  from  Dallas. 
In short, I would be most appreciative of any assistance you could offer in adding 
Missouri to the list of states exempt from the restrictions of the Wright Amendment. 
Thank  you  for  all  of  your  efforts  in  the  Senate  on  behalf  of  Missouri,  and  please 
contact me should you have any questions or concerns. 

Sincerely, 

AUGUST A. BUSCH III, 

Chairman of the Board. 

MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN 
St. Louis, MO, November 10, 2005 

Hon. CHRISTOPHER S. BOND, 
United States Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Bond: 

The  Missouri  Botanical  Garden  applauds  and  supports  your  effort  to  repeal  the 
Wright  Amendment  and  ‘‘through  ticketing’’  restrictions.  The  Wright  Amendment 
has caused an unfair monopoly on travel which adversely affects the costs and time 
it takes for visitors to come to St. Louis. 

The  St.  Louis  area  has  a  number  of  attractions  and  world-class  cultural  institu-
tions including the Missouri Botanical Garden that are visited by tourists each year. 
It is important for visitors to be able to come to St. Louis on a cost-competitive basis 
and with timely air service. At the same time, we want to be supportive of our cor-
porate community and their diverse travel needs. This is key to our ability to attract 
business  development  in  our  region.  Therefore,  on  behalf  of  the  Garden  and  metro-
politan  St.  Louis,  we  ask  that  all  who  want  to  visit  have  every  opportunity  to  do 
so. Thus, we support your efforts to repeal the Wright Amendment. 

Sincerely, 

PETER H. RAVEN, 

Director.

RE: REPEAL OF WRIGHT AMENDMENT 

Dear Senator Hutchison: 
I  am  writing  to  you  as  Chairman  of  the  U.S.  Hispanic  Contractors  Association 
(‘‘USHCA’’),  a  national,  non-profit  trade  association  based  in  Austin,  Texas.  The 
USHCA  is  dedicated  to  providing  the  support  necessary  for  the  advancement,  eco-
nomic  growth  and  full  participation  of  Hispanic  owned  businesses  in  all  areas  of 
contracting  and  procurement  contracts.  Our  organization  represents  the  fastest 
growing ethnic group in one of the fastest growing fields in the country. 

The  USHCA  fully  supports  the  American  Right  to  Fly  Act  (S.  1424),  introduced 
in  the  Senate  by  Senator  John  Ensign,  which  calls  for  the  complete  repeal  of  the 
Wright Amendment, Section 29 of the International Air Transportation Competition 
Act  of  1979,  Public  Law  No.  96–192,  94  Stat.  35  (1980).  As  you  are  aware,  the 
Wright  Amendment  was  originally  enacted  in  order  to  protect  Dallas/Fort  Worth 
Airport  (‘‘DFW  Airport’’)  from  competition  from  Love  Field  (and  to  airline  carriers 
who  fly  into  DFW  Airport  from  competition  from  Southwest  Airlines).  The  Wright

Amendment  prohibits  interstate  service  from  Love  Field  except  for  flights  to  the 
states of Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Kansas, and Mis-
sissippi. The repeal of the Wright Amendment, as advocated in the American Right 
to Fly Act, would completely free Love Field from these restrictions. 

The  USHCA  endorses  the  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  and  the  opening  of 
Love Field to all types of interstate flights. Such a move would benefit the members 
of  USHCA  who  frequently  fly  for  jobs  and  are  looking  for  cheaper  alternatives.  As 
a  Texas-based  organization,  the  USHCA  believes  that  the  repeal  of  the  Wright 
Amendment  will  dramatically  lower  fares  in  the  State,  which  results  in  a  cor-
responding benefit to our members. 

The  statistics  clearly  support  such  a  removal.  Although  DFW  Airport  may  have 
needed  economic  protection  at  the  time  the  Wright  Amendment  was  enacted,  such 
protection  is  no  longer  necessary.  DFW  Airport  is  now  the  third  largest  airport  in 
the world. The average one-way business fare to and from North Texas is 48 percent 
above the national average. American Airlines has a monopoly in 49 Wright Amend-
ment  protected  domestic  markets  that  serve  over  6.5  million  one-way  passengers 
each year. If DFW Airport is forced to compete with Dallas Love Field, fares would 
fall and more people could afford to travel. The Department of Transportation even 
named  this  phenomenon  ‘‘The  Southwest  Effect,’’  because  it  occurs  so  consistently 
and dramatically when Southwest begins to compete in new markets. 

This country has consistently subscribed to the belief that competition in the mar-
ketplace  is  to  be  encouraged  as  beneficial  to  consumers.  Entire  bodies  of  law  are 
dedicated to promoting competition and punishing those who restrain such competi-
tion.  The  Wright  Amendment  interferes  with  this  competition,  costing  consumers 
nationwide  over  $4  billion  annually.  It  is  time  the  Congress  allowed  this  spirit  of 
competition  to  thrive  in  the  airline  industry  by  removing  this  26-year-old  law  that 
restricts competition and has long outlived its utility. 

Please support the American Right to Fly Act (S. 1424). 

Very truly yours, 

FRANK FUENTES AND JAVIER ARIAS, 

Chairmen. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NORM ARCHIBALD, MAYOR, CITY OF ABILENE 

The  members  of  the  Abilene  City  Council  and  I  recently  gave  our  unanimous 
backing  to  a  resolution  that  supports  keeping  in  place  the  Wright  Amendment  and 
limiting  Dallas  Love  Field  Airport  to  its  existing  short-haul  flying.  We  did  this  be-
cause we believe that any attempt to change the Wright Amendment may adversely 
affect  air  operations  at  Abilene  Regional  Airport  through  reduced  Federal  Airport 
Improvement  Program  funding  opportunities  and  reduced  enplanements.  Without 
the  Wright  Amendment,  I  see  a  strong  possibility  that  flights  between  Abilene  and 
Dallas/Fort Worth could be reduced. This would have a negative impact on Abilene’s 
growing economy. 

Good passenger air service is important to the people of Abilene. American Eagle 
has  consistently  provided  air  service  for  Abilene  for  many  years,  as  other  air  car-
riers have come and gone. American Eagle, American Airlines’ regional carrier, cur-
rently operates seven daily flights from Abilene to DFW. In addition, Eagle Aviation 
Services  (EASI),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  American  Eagle,  employs  about  378 
people at its aircraft maintenance and records storage facility located at Abilene Re-
gional  Airport.  American’s  operations  in  Abilene  help  contribute  to  the  economic 
success of our city and our region. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF M. LAMAR MUSE, FOUNDING PRESIDENT/CEO, 

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES (1970–1978) 

I  am  the  person  most  responsible  for  Southwest  Airlines’  decision  to  fight  being 
forced to move Southwest’s operation from Love Field in Dallas, Texas to DPW Air-
port  at  the  time  of  DFW’s  opening  in  February  1974.  Had  I  not  opposed  the  move 
to  DFW,  Southwest’s  short-haul  intrastate  operation  to  Houston  and  San  Antonio 
would have withered on the vine and there would be no such low-cost, low-fare air-
line today. Of course, if Southwest had died early on as a result of a move to DFW, 
deregulation  of  the  airline  industry  in  November  1978  would  probably  have  never 
occurred and we would not be discussing repealing or changing the Wright Amend-
ment today because it would have never been signed into law in 1979. 

Had  I  still  been  CEO  of  Southwest  at  the  time  of  the  passage  of  the  Wright 
Amendment,  I  firmly  believe  that  I  could  and  would  have  staved  off  its  passage  as

a bill to protect poor little old DFW with all of its healthy Legacy and foreign Inter-
national carriers. And, if not the total bill, certainly the clearly anticompetitive and 
protectionist  provisions  barring  through-ticketing  and  baggage  transfer  of  pas-
sengers to points beyond the neighboring states. 

That  is  water  under  the  bridge,  however.  The  fact  is  that  we  have  the  Wright 
Amendment,  it  is  the  subject  of  bitter  controversy  between  all  the  parties,  and  a 
compromise  is  long  overdue.  Since  it  will  always  be  politically  impossible  to  accom-
plish  total  repeal,  frankly,  the  compromise  I  propose  will  be  better  for  all  parties. 
I  believe  the  best  and  clearest  way  to  explain  my  proposal  is  to  ask  each  of  you 
to  suppose  for  a  few  minutes  that  you  are  (1)  a  resident  of  Midland,  Texas  and  (2) 
that you represent Midland and all other Texas cities served by Southwest. Senators 
representing other neighboring states, pick a city. 

Currently, Midland has six round trips per day between Love Field and Midland- 
Odessa  Airport.  One  proceeds  beyond  MAF  to  El  Paso  and  one  overnights  in  Mid-
land.  The  other  four  make  a  25-minute  turn  and  return  to  Love  Field  and  points 
beyond  that  can  be  legally  served.  Now  first  presume  total  repeal  of  the  Wright 
Amendment.  What  would  happen  to  Midland’s  service?  Since  Southwest  has  pub-
licly stated that it would abide by the Love Field Master Plan (LFMP), which would 
limit  annual  flight  operations  and  total  passengers  boarded  at  Love  Field,  South-
west  would  very  soon  have  to  start  cutting  back  on  short  haul  flights  to  the  Mid-
land’s  of  their  system  (ELP,  MAF,  LLB,  AMA,  ABQ,  OKC.  TUL,  LIT,  MSY,  HOU) 
so  as  to  be  able  to  operate  supposedly  more  profitable  long-haul,  nonstop  flights  to 
the 43 beyond airports currently restricted. 

With total repeal, every Legacy carrier (other than AMR) plus LCC’s would move 
either  a  portion  or  all  of  their  flights  from  DFW  to  Love  Field,  resulting  in  intense 
competition  at  Love  Field  for  the  limited  number  of  gates  and  flights  that  would 
be  allowed  to  be  operated  from  the  airport  under  the  LFMP.  With  total  repeal,  ev-
erybody, including Southwest, would lose money. But, more importantly, the citizens 
of Texas in AUS, ELP, MAF, LBB, etc. would lose service to Dallas. So, please pro-
tect Southwest from itself, by not even considering total repeal at this time and pro-
tect  the  citizens  of  the  State  of  Texas  and  Dallas  from  having  to  face  cutbacks  in 
intrastate  service  at  Love  Field  so  that  Southwest  can  pursue  money  losing  service 
in long-haul markets from Love Field. 

Now, the alternative. First lift the through-ticketing and baggage transfer restric-
tions  that  should  never  have  been  part  of  the  Act  in  the  first  place  and  let  us  see 
what  happens.  First,  instead  of  cutting  flights  to  Midland,  Southwest  would  prob-
ably  have  to  increase  service  to  at  least  ten  flights  per  day  with  at  least  eight  of 
those  flights  proceeding  nonstop  beyond  Midland  to  one  or  more  of  the  17  airports 
served  by  Southwest  in  the  western  part  of  the  United  States.  Further,  Midland 
would  have  two-stop  service  to  points  served  north,  northeast  and  southeast  from 
Love  Field.  So,  Midland  and  all  of  the  other  cities  like  Midland  listed  above  will 
have  at  least  a  100  percent  improvement  in  service  and  more  like  a  200  percent  to 
300  percent  improvement.  And,  of  course,  North  Texas  citizens  will  have  nonstop 
service to all Texas and neighboring state service points plus potential single plane, 
one-stop service to every other point on Southwest’s system. In all probability, there 
would be not one single DFW carrier who would be so stupid as to move any of their 
DFW  service  to  Love  Field  for  the  sole  purpose  of  competing  with  one-stop  flights 
offered by Southwest. If they did, they would not stay very long. 

That  is  not  all  though.  Lifting  the  through-ticketing  restriction  also  permits  an 
unrestricted  flow  of  Southwest  flight  equipment  and  flight  crews  to  and  from  its 
headquarters city, thus permitting huge improvements in both productivity and em-
ployee morale as a result of permitting most flight crews to reside and be based out 
of their headquarters city rather than bases now scattered all over the country. 

The  icing  on  the  cake  would  be  for  the  State  of  Tennessee  to  be  included  in  the 
Wright Amendment as a neighboring state for good reason. The only city Southwest 
has  between  Dallas  and  airports  it  serves  in  the  east  and  northeast  is  Little  Rock, 
Arkansas.  With  Tennessee  included,  many  flights  could  be  operated  from  Dallas 
Love  Field  to  northeast  destinations  via  not  only  Nashville,  but  also  it  would  en-
courage Southwest to begin service to both Memphis and Knoxville from Love Field. 
Who  wins,  and  who  loses?  Everybody  wins  or  can  win  if  they  take  proper  steps; 
conversely  nobody  loses.  Southwest  is  of  course  the  big  winner,  even  more  so  than 
if  they  were  successful  in  getting  total  repeal  for  which  they  will  argue.  The  city 
governments  of  both  Dallas  and  Ft  Worth  win,  as  well  as  all  of  the  citizens  they 
represent. DFW International Airport wins in that none of their present service will 
go to Love Field and, AMR can win if they will price their product in such a manner 
as to not gouge the public as they have been able to do in the past strictly because 
of the presence of the Wright Amendment.

An  additional  wrinkle  that  could  be  considered  would  be  to  provide  for  the  total 
repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  in  five  years  from  the  date  of  passage  of  the  cur-
rent proposed changes, provided that by that time the Texas legislature would have 
created  the  North  Texas  Airport  Authority  which  would  own,  control  and  operate 
each  and  every  potential  passenger  carrying  airport  in  the  area,  including  DFW, 
Love Field, Meachem, Alliance and Dallas Executive. 

I  sincerely  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  and  propose  a  win-win  com-
promise for your consideration. In closing, let me make it perfectly clear that I rep-
resent  me,  myself  and  I  only.  I  am  not  representing  any  air  carrier,  any  city  hall, 
any citizen group, or any political party. 
Thank you for your time and attention. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH ‘‘IKE’’ EICHELKRAUT, PRESIDENT, 

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PILOTS’ ASSOCIATION 

On  behalf  of  our  4,742  members  of  the  Southwest  Airlines  Pilots’  Association,  I 
present  this  testimony  to  support  a  full  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment.  In  1990 
when  I  came  on  board  with  Southwest  Airlines  following  a  dozen  years  of  military 
flying, I was one of only 900 pilots employed by the company. Today, our pilot num-
bers  have  quintupled  as  we  quickly  approach  5,000.  During  these  past  15  years  as 
well as prior to my hiring, our company has remained profitable and grown dramati-
cally,  unlike  many  of  our  competitors.  Because  of  the  Wright  Amendment  in  place, 
affecting  our  hometown  airport,  Love  Field  in  Dallas,  the  only  reasonable  alter-
native  for  Southwest  Airlines  to  expand  its  business  was  to  choose  markets  con-
necting  other  Texas  cities  to  cities  across  our  nation.  Today,  SWA  flies  coast  to 
coast,  upper  Midwest  to  the  coasts  and  up  and  down  the  coasts.  We  regularly  add 
service and new cities, as evidenced by our recent announcement of Denver in Janu-
ary  2006.  However,  the  city  which  Southwest  Airlines  has  served  the  longest  is 
strangely missing from this success story. 

The  evidence  of  this  anomaly  most  obvious  to  our  pilots  is  the  geographical  and 
numerical  expansion  of  our  crew  domiciles.  Our  pilot  bases  or  domiciles  increased 
from  only  three  in  1990  (Dallas,  Houston  and  Phoenix)  to  7  today  (the  previous 
three  plus  Oakland,  Chicago,  Baltimore  and  Orlando).  However,  every  one  of  our 
seven domiciles has grown and done so dramatically except for one, the Dallas pilot 
base.  With  fewer  than  400  pilots  today,  the  Dallas  pilot  crew  base,  even  though  it 
is  collocated  with  our  company’s  headquarters  and  origins,  is  by  far  our  smallest 
domicile;  a  mere  40  percent  of  the  size  of  our  two  largest  crew  bases,  Phoenix  and 
Chicago.  The  lack  of  growth  here  in  the  Dallas  pilot  base  at  Love  Field  is  a  testa-
ment  to  the  choking  effects  of  the  Wright  Amendment  on  traffic  growth  overall  in 
the north Texas area. However, let’s not mistake this for a local or even state issue. 
The  limited  growth  and  options  affects  all  Americans,  not  solely  Texans,  traveling 
to and from the Dallas area for business or personal reasons. In my experience, any 
time service or competition is limited, even artificially as it is by the Wright Amend-
ment, the customer suffers through higher prices and inconvenience. 

Inconvenience  is  not  only  experienced  by  the  consumer,  but  by  the  airline  whose 
business model is based upon high-frequency point-to-point service and high aircraft 
utilization  rates.  Airlines  generate  revenue  by  carrying  passengers  and  cargo  from 
one  point  to  another.  I  know  this  appears  overly  basic,  but  I  use  it  to  illustrate  a 
point. Many have opined that Southwest Airlines ought to move its operations over 
to DFW. Although this suggestion may sound simple it is not. Aside from reserving 
a  very  large  moving  van  and  scheduling  a  convenient  weekend  to  make  the  move, 
what happens after we make the 8 mile relocation is important to the basic premise 
of  simplicity  in  our  business  model  of  producing  revenue.  Unfortunately  for  DFW, 
simplicity is not an inherent trait of the airport. For instance, the average taxi time 
per  aircraft  at  DFW  is  approximately  28  minutes.  For  Southwest  Airlines  at  Love 
Field  and  elsewhere,  our  average  taxi  time  is  much  less.  In  fact,  our  system  wide 
average  time  devoted  not  only  to  taxiing  but  to  loading  and  deplaning  passengers 
is  about  25  minutes  per  stop.  The  fact  that  aircraft  spend  a  relatively  inordinate 
amount  of  time  taxiing  on  airport  property  at  DFW  is  not  a  mere  inconvenience  to 
the  traveling  public.  It  would  be  a  clear  departure  from  a  tenet  of  our  business 
model,  high  utilization  rate  of  our  aircraft  in  order  to  maximize  revenue  inflows. 
The added taxi time at DFW would force us to burn extra jet fuel, compensate crews 
more  for  the  extra  time,  but  produce  less  revenue  by  eliminating,  on  average,  one 
flight per aircraft per day operating from that airport. The decrease in aircraft utili-
zation rate alone is a minimum of 12 percent. The mere size and complexity of DFW 
airport creates an adverse drag on our business model and therefore simply moving 
would  not  be  smartly  moving.  Southwest  has  avoided  other  less  efficient  airports

throughout  the  country  for  this  exact  reason,  such  as  in  Chicago,  Boston,  Miami, 
San  Francisco,  Houston  and  New  York.  At  Southwest  Airlines,  efficiency  and  sim-
plicity  is  a  trademark  of  its  revenue  model  and  hence,  integral  to  our  profitability 
formula. 

Today, we’re looking to Congress to free the leg irons that the Wright Amendment 
put on Love Field and the traveling public almost three decades ago. It is a perfect 
irony  that  the  bill  that  then  House  Speaker  Jim  Wright  (D–TX—Ft.  Worth)  used 
as  a  vehicle  for  his  amendment  was  the  landmark  airline  deregulation  bill.  Today, 
we  are  simply  asking  Congress  to  complete  a  critical  piece  of  deregulation  that  un-
fairly  impacts  Southwest  Airlines  with  one  of  the  most  anti-competitive  pieces  of 
legislation  ever  to  have  been  passed  by  either  chamber.  Despite  this  effort  to  keep 
Southwest  Airlines  marginalized  as  a  ‘‘Texas-only’’  carrier,  the  company  has  ex-
panded to become the fastest-growing and arguably best-loved carrier in the Nation. 
How  did  we  do  it?  Competition.  That’s  all  we  are  asking  Congress  for;  A  chance  to 
compete in the Dallas market—just as we have done in countless other markets. To 
do this we cannot be tied to someone else’s playbook. By removing the anticompeti-
tive restrictions placed on Southwest at Dallas Love Field, the traveling public will 
have  the  same  cost-saving  choices  that  travelers  in  Chicago,  Philadelphia,  Wash-
ington and Boston have come to know. Wright is wrong, Mr. Chairman, we ask you 
to set Love free. 

ADDITIONAL QUOTES FOR THE RECORD 

‘‘The  repeal  of  the  Wright  Amendment  would  have  reaching  effects  on  air  service 
from  Gregg  County  due  to  the  fact  that  American  would  have  to  reduce  flights  so 
they  could  be  more  competitive  with  Southwest  at  Love  Field.  Gregg  County  has 
only one airline serving our area at East Texas Regional Airport. If we were to lose 
it  or  if  the  service  was  reduced,  it  would  have  major  negative  effect  on  our  region, 
economic development, quality of life and many other areas.’’ 

BILL STOUDT, 

Gregg County Judge. 

‘‘The  loss  of  air  service  to  East  Texas  Regional  Airport  would  be  devastating  to 
the Gregg County area. The growth and economic development of the area is largely 
dependent  upon  vital  transportation,  and  air  service  is  a  big  part  of  that  transpor-
tation  picture.  We  need  to  seriously  consider  the  effect  that  the  repeal  of  this 
amendment would have on the smaller communities of East Texas.’’

‘‘The  six  flights  from  DFW  to  Easterwood  airport  have  a  significant  effect  on  the 
economic well being of Texas A&M University and the Brazos Valley. To reduce the 
number of flights leaving DFW would negatively impact the status that DFW enjoys 
as  a  first  class  major  airline  hub.  We  are  proud  and  thankful  that  we  have  service 
to an airport with the facilities that DFW offers our passengers and want to be able 
to continue this relationship in the future.’’ 

JOHN HAPP, 
Mayor Pro Tem, 

City of Bryan/College Station, Texas.
