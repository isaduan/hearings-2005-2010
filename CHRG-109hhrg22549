HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY, JOINTLY WITH

THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON RESEARCH

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Fueling the Future: On the Road

to the Hydrogen Economy

WEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Wednesday,  July  20,  2005,  at  10:00  a.m.,  the  Energy  and  Research  Sub-
committees of the House Science Committee will hold a joint hearing to examine the
progress  that  has  been  made  in  hydrogen  research  since  the  launch  of  the  Presi-
dent’s  Hydrogen  Initiative  and  the  next  steps  the  Federal  Government  should  take
to best advance a hydrogen economy.
2. Witnesses
Mr. Douglas Faulkner is the Acting Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy (DOE).
Dr.  David  Bodde  is  the  Director  of  Innovation  and  Public  Policy  at  Clemson  Uni-
versity’s International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR).
Mr.  Mark  Chernoby  is  Vice  President  for  Advanced  Vehicle  Engineering  at  the
DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
Dr. George Crabtree is the Director of the Materials Science Division at Argonne
National Laboratory.
Dr. John Heywood is the Director of the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology.

3. Overarching Questions

The hearing will focus on the following overarching questions:

1. What progress has been made toward addressing the principal technical bar-
riers to a successful transition to the use of hydrogen as a primary transpor-
tation  fuel  since  the  Administration  announced  its  hydrogen  initiatives,
FreedomCAR and the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative? What are the re-
maining potential technical ‘‘showstoppers?’’

2. What  are  the  research  areas  where  breakthroughs  are  needed  to  advance  a
hydrogen  economy?  How  has  DOE  responded  to  the  report  by  the  National
Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  calling  for  an  increased  emphasis  on  basic  re-
search?  How  is  DOE  incorporating  the  results  of  the  Basic  Energy  Sciences
workshop  on  basic  research  needs  for  a  hydrogen  economy  into  the  research
agenda for the hydrogen initiative?

3. The  NAS  report  suggested  that  the  research  agenda  should  be  developed
with future policy decisions in mind. How has DOE increased its policy anal-
ysis  capabilities  as  recommended  by  the  NAS?  How  will  the  results  of  that
analysis be applied to the research agenda?

4. Overview

• In  his  2003  State  of  the  Union  speech,  President  Bush  announced  the  cre-
ation of a new Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, which built on the FreedomCAR ini-
tiative  announced  in  2002.  Together,  the  initiatives  aim  to  provide  the  tech-
nology  for  a  hydrogen-based  transportation  economy,  including  production  of
hydrogen,  transportation  and  distribution  of  hydrogen,  and  the  vehicles  that
will  use  the  hydrogen.  Fuel  cell  cars  running  on  hydrogen  would  emit  only

water vapor and, if domestic energy sources were used, would not be depend-
ent on foreign fuels.
• Industry is participating in the hydrogen initiatives, and has invested heavily
in  hydrogen  technology,  particularly  the  automobile  manufacturers  and  oil
companies.  The  FreedomCAR  program  is  a  partnership  between  Ford,  GM,
DaimlerChrysler, and the Federal Government, and the President’s Hydrogen
Fuel Initiative expanded that partnership to include major oil companies such
as  Shell  and  BP,  and  merchant  producers  of  hydrogen  like  Air  Products  and
Chemicals,  Inc.  Although  exact  amounts  of  industry  investment  are  propri-
etary, GM alone is estimated to have spent over $1.5 billion, and other auto-
makers have invested similar amounts.
• The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended changes to the hydro-
gen  initiatives  in  its  2004  report,  The  Hydrogen  Economy:  Opportunities,
Costs, Barriers, and R&D Needs. The report particularly stressed the need for
a  greater  emphasis  on  basic,  exploratory  research  because  of  the  significant
technical  barriers  that  must  be  overcome.  DOE  has  responded  by  expanding
the  hydrogen  program  into  the  Office  of  Science,  and  has  requested  $33  mil-
lion for fiscal year 2006 (FY06) to fund basic research efforts in DOE’s Office
of Science.
• In addition, the NAS report noted that DOE needs to think about policy ques-
tions as it develops its research and development (R&D) agenda: ‘‘Significant
industry  investments  in  advance  of  market  forces  will  not  be  made  unless
government  creates  a  business  environment  that  reflects  societal  priorities
with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and oil imports.. . .The DOE should
estimate what levels of investment over time are required—and in which pro-
gram and project areas—in order to achieve a significant reduction in carbon
dioxide  emissions  from  passenger  vehicles  by  mid-century.’’  DOE  has  ex-
panded its hydrogen policy and analysis efforts to be able to answer questions
like those posed by the NAS, but the analytical work is still in progress, and
available results are still preliminary.
• Even  with  the  most  optimistic  of  assumptions,  it  will  take  some  time  for  hy-
drogen vehicles to compose a significant part of the automobile fleet. The NAS
estimates  that  sales  of  hydrogen  vehicles  will  not  be  significant  enough  for
the full benefits of a hydrogen economy to be realized at least until 2025.
• During the transition to a hydrogen economy, many of the technologies being
developed  for  hydrogen  vehicles,  such  as  hybrid  systems  technology  and  ad-
vanced  lightweight  materials  could  be  deployed  in  conventional  automobiles
to  provide  reduced  oil  dependence  and  emissions.  Without  the  proper  incen-
tives,  vehicle  improvements  are  likely  to  continue  to  be  used  to  increase  per-
formance, rather than improving fuel economy, as they have been for the past
twenty years. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that if today’s
vehicles had the same weight and acceleration as cars did in 1987, they would
get 20 percent better gas mileage due to technology improvements.

5. Background
What are the technical challenges?

Major  advances  are  needed  across  a  wide  range  of  technologies  for  hydrogen  to
be  affordable,  safe,  cleanly  produced,  and  readily  distributed.  The  production,  stor-
age  and  use  of  hydrogen  all  present  significant  technical  challenges.  While  the  re-
search effort at DOE has produced promising results, the program is still a long way
from meeting its goals in any of these areas.

Hydrogen does not exist in a usable form in nature, and has to be produced from
something  else,  such  as  coal  or  natural  gas.  But  one  goal  of  using  hydrogen  is  to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. If hydrogen is to be produced without emissions
of  carbon  dioxide,  then  the  technology  to  capture  and  store  carbon  dioxide  while
making hydrogen must improve significantly. The other main goal of using hydrogen
is to reduce the use of imported energy. Today most hydrogen is produced from nat-
ural  gas,  but  in  order  to  supply  the  entire  transportation  sector  significant  imports
of  natural  gas  would  be  required.  Other  possible  means  of  producing  hydrogen,  in-
cluding  nuclear  energy  and  renewable  energy  sources,  are  inherently  cleaner  than
coal, but are far from affordable with existing technology.

Another  major  hurdle  is  finding  ways  to  store  hydrogen,  particularly  on  board  a
vehicle. Hydrogen is a small molecule with properties that make it difficult to store
in  small  volumes  and  in  lightweight  materials.  The  American  Physical  Society  ar-
gued  in  its  2004  report  on  hydrogen,  The  Hydrogen  Initiative,  that  a  new  material
would have to be discovered in order to meet the FreedomCAR goals.

The  NAS  estimated  that  fuel  cells  themselves  would  need  a  ten-  to  twenty-fold
improvement  before  fuel  cell  vehicles  become  competitive  with  conventional  tech-
nology. Large improvements have been made since the report has been released, but
additional improvements are still needed. DOE estimates that roughly a five-fold de-
crease  in  cost  will  be  required,  while  at  the  same  time  increasing  performance  and
durability.  Current  fuel  cells  wear  out  quickly,  and  lifetimes  are  far  short  of  those
required  to  compete  with  a  gasoline  engine.  Small-scale  distributed  hydrogen  pro-
duction also needs improvement, and the NAS report recommended increased focus
in  that  area  because  it  may  be  among  the  first  hydrogen-related  technologies  to  be
deployed.
What are the non-technical challenges, in the policy and regulatory areas?

Since  many  of  the  benefits  of  a  hydrogen  economy,  such  as  reduced  greenhouse
gas emissions, are not currently accounted for in the marketplace, it will be difficult
for hydrogen vehicles to compete with conventional technology. Even if all the tech-
nical challenges are met, and industry has the capability to produce hydrogen vehi-
cles that are competitive with conventional vehicles, a successful hydrogen economy
is not guaranteed. First, the transition to a hydrogen economy will require an enor-
mous  investment  to  create  a  new  infrastructure.  Changes  in  regulation,  training
and  public  habits  and  attitudes  will  also  be  necessary.  Estimates  of  the  cost  of  cre-
ating  a  fueling  infrastructure  (replacing  or  altering  gas  stations  and  distribution
systems) alone are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. DOE is initiating an effort
to better understand the economics and influences of policy incentives on a possible
transition to hydrogen.
How are the Hydrogen Initiatives funded?

The  FreedomCAR  and  the  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  are  expected  to  cost  $1.7  bil-
lion over five years from FY03 to FY08. The President called for $358 million across
DOE for these programs in the FY06 request, an increase of $48 million, 16 percent
over  levels  appropriated  for  the  initiatives  in  FY05.  However,  this  increase  comes
at a time when R&D programs in the other energy efficiency and renewable energy
programs are seeing decreasing requests overall, by $74 million, 10 percent to $692
million.  Unless  additional  funding  is  provided  to  renewable  energy  and  energy  effi-
ciency  programs  at  DOE  in  general,  the  projected  further  increases  in  the
FreedomCAR  and  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  will  likely  result  in  more  cuts  to  other
efficiency and renewable programs.

Technology Background
What is a Fuel Cell?

Central  to  the  operation  of  the  hydrogen-based  economy  is  a  device  known  as  a
fuel  cell  that  would  convert  hydrogen  fuels  to  electricity.  In  cars,  these  devices
would  be  connected  to  electric  motors  that  would  provide  the  power  now  supplied
by  gasoline  engines.  A  fuel  cell  produces  electricity  by  means  of  an  electrochemical
reaction  much  like  a  battery.  There  is  an  important  difference,  however.  Rather
than using up the chemicals inside the cells, a fuel cell uses hydrogen fuel, and oxy-

gen extracted from the air, to produce electricity. As long as hydrogen fuel and oxy-
gen are fed into the fuel cell, it will continue to generate electric power.

Different  types  of  fuel  cells  work  with  different  electrochemical  reactions.  Cur-
rently  most  automakers  are  considering  Proton  Exchange  Membrane  (PEM)  fuel
cells for their vehicles.
Benefits of a Hydrogen-based Economy

A hydrogen-based economy could have two important benefits. First, hydrogen can
be  manufactured  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  natural  gas,  biofuels,  petro-
leum,  coal,  and  even  by  passing  electricity  through  water  (electrolysis).  Depending
on the choice of source, hydrogen could substantially reduce our dependence on for-
eign oil and natural gas.

Second,  the  consumption  of  hydrogen  through  fuel  cells  yields  water  as  its  only
emission.  Other  considerations,  such  as  the  by-products  of  the  hydrogen  production
process, will also be important in choosing the source of the hydrogen. For example,
natural  gas  is  the  current  feedstock  for  industrial  hydrogen,  but  its  production  re-
leases  carbon  dioxide;  production  from  coal  releases  more  carbon  dioxide  and  other
emissions;  and  production  from  water  means  that  pollution  may  be  created  by  the
generation of electricity used in electrolysis. Production from solar electricity would
mean  no  pollution  in  the  generation  process  or  in  consumption,  but  is  currently
more expensive and less efficient than other methods.
6. Witnesses Questions

The  witnesses  have  been  asked  to  address  the  following  questions  in  their  testi-

mony:
Mr. Douglas Faulkner:

• What progress has been made toward addressing the principal technical bar-
riers to a successful transition to the use of hydrogen as a primary transpor-
tation  fuel  since  the  Administration  announced  its  hydrogen  initiatives,
FreedomCAR and the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative? What are the re-
maining potential technical ‘‘showstoppers?’’
• What  are  the  research  areas  where  breakthroughs  are  needed  to  advance  a
hydrogen  economy?  How  has  DOE  responded  to  the  report  by  the  National
Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  calling  for  an  increased  emphasis  on  basic  re-
search?  How  is  DOE  incorporating  the  results  of  the  Basic  Energy  Sciences
workshop  on  basic  research  needs  for  a  hydrogen  economy  into  the  research
agenda for the hydrogen initiative?
• The NAS report suggested that the research agenda should be developed with
future  policy  decisions  in  mind.  How  has  DOE  increased  its  policy  analysis
capabilities  as  recommended  by  the  NAS?  How  will  the  results  of  that  anal-
ysis be applied to the research agenda?
• How  is  DOE  conducting  planning  for,  and  analysis  of,  the  policy  changes
(such as incentives or regulation) that might be required to accelerate a tran-
sition to hydrogen? What other agencies are involved in planning for, or facili-
tating, such a transition?

Mr. Mark Chrenoby:

• What  criteria  does  DaimlerChrysler  consider  when  making  investment  deci-

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Good  morning.  I  want—the  hearing  will

come to order.

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  joint  hearing  of  the  Energy
and  Research  Subcommittees  of  the  House  Science  Committee.
Today,  we  are  going  to  get  a  status  report  on  the  progress  of  fed-
eral  research  efforts  driving  the  development  of  fuel  cells  and  the
hydrogen to power them.

This  hearing  has  become  something  of  an  annual  tradition  for
the  Science  Committee.  We  have  had  a  Full—we  have  had  Full
Committee  hearings,  field  hearings,  and  Energy  Subcommittee
hearings  on  this  topic.  This  year,  I  am  pleased  that  our  colleagues
in  the  Research  Subcommittee  are  joining  us  to  examine  the  con-
tributions  of  individual  researchers  and  university  research  activi-
ties to the hydrogen and FreedomCAR initiatives.

At  this  time,  it  is  a  privilege  for  me  to  recognize  my  colleague
from South Carolina, the Chairman of the Research Subcommittee,
Mr. Inglis, for his opening statement.

Chairman INGLIS. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
Good  morning.  And  I  am  excited  about  convening  this  hearing.
It  is  the  first  on  the  hydrogen  economy  this  Congress,  I  believe.
And  this  topic  has  the  potential  for  being  the  next  ‘‘giant  leap  for
mankind.’’ That is certainly our hope.

The  way  I  see  it,  there  are  three  keys  necessary  to  unlock  the
door to a full hydrogen economy. The first is commitment. The sec-
ond is collaboration. And the third is discovery.

We need a commitment from the United States similar to the one
that  President  Kennedy  made  when  he  challenged  Congress  in
1961 to land a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. The
President’s  hydrogen  fuel  initiative  and  FreedomCAR  are  steps  in
the  right  direction,  and  I  welcome  the  testimony  on  the  progress
that has been made on these initiatives to date.

Strong  public  and  private  collaboration  is  the  second  imperative
if we are to see real and hopeful ahead-of-schedule success. And in
my District, Clemson University is building the International Cen-
ter  for  Automotive  Research,  ICAR,  funded  in  significant  part  by
BMW  and  Michelin.  At  ICAR,  researchers  will  do  what  they  do
best, industry will do what it does best, and markets will establish
the winners and losers. You will hear more about this collaborative
effort today from Dr. David Bodde, Director of Innovation and Pub-
lic Policy at ICAR.

The  third  key,  discovery,  is  where  our  greatest  challenges  lie.
That  is  why  it  is  critically  important  that  we  fund  basic  research
supporting  the  production,  storage,  and  distribution  of  hydrogen.
The development of a hydrogen economy depends on breakthroughs
in these areas. At the same time, we should also be pursuing other
advanced  technologies,  such  as  better  batteries,  photovoltaic  cells
that may take us to a new plateau of energy independence.

One of these technologies may turn out to be the ‘‘8-track’’ of the
hydrogen  economy.  Another  may  be  the  ‘‘cassette  player,’’  yet  an-
other  unknown  technology  may  prove  to  be  the  ‘‘CD’’  of  auto-
mobiles, which, in turn, may be followed by the MP3.

Transition  to  a  hydrogen  economy  holds  great  promise  on  many
levels.  All  along  the  way,  the  air  will  be  getting  cleaner,  the  oil
pressure  could  come  off  the  Middle  East,  entrepreneurs  will  be

making  money  and  employing  people,  and  we  will  be  winning  our
energy independence.

Admittedly, there are technology and cost challenges ahead of us,
but I do not believe them to be insurmountable. In fact, I think we
are definitely up to the challenge.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses  on  all  of  these
issues,  and  I  thank  you,  Madame  Chairman,  for  convening  your
hearing.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BOB INGLIS

Good  morning,  and  thank  you  Madam  Chairman  for  bringing  us  together  for  our
first  hearing  on  the  hydrogen  economy  this  Congress.  I  am  pleased  that  we  have
convened  this  joint  hearing  on  an  issue  that  I  believe  has  the  potential  to  be  the

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Well, thank you, Chairman Inglis.
At  last  year’s  hearing  on  this  topic,  we  closely  examined  two  re-
ports, one prepared by the National Academy of Sciences, the other
by  the  American  Physical  Society,  both  of  which  emphasized  the
importance  of  basic  research  to  the  long-term  success  of  the  Presi-
dent’s hydrogen and FreedomCAR initiatives.

I am pleased that President Bush took these recommendations to
heart and increased funding in his fiscal year 2006 budget request
for  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science  to  address  some
of  the  fundamental  obstacles  to  greater  use  of  hydrogen  and  fuel
cells.  I  am  anxious  to  hear  how  the  results  of  this  basic  research
are being incorporated into the fuel cell and hydrogen technologies
under development and how they are shaping the research agenda
going forward.

I think that research designed to benefit the Nation significantly
in the long-term could benefit us marginally in the near-term, ulti-
mately  giving  us  the  greater  return  on  our  investments  in  hydro-
gen  and  fuel  cell  research.  We  couldn’t  ask  for  more  in  this  era  of
tight  budgets.  We  have  a  diverse  panel  of  witnesses  today  rep-
resenting  some  exceptional  institutions  engaged  in  all  kinds  of  hy-
drogen and fuel research.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Biggert follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JUDY BIGGERT

This hearing will give this committee another opportunity to get an update on the
work  underway  at  the  Department  of  Energy  as  part  of  the  President’s  Hydrogen
Fuel  and  FreedomCAR  initiatives.  I  also  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  being  so
generous with their time, and for agreeing to share with us their insight and exper-
tise on the topics of fuel cells and hydrogen.

I have a keen interest in both the fuel cell and hydrogen initiatives that the Presi-
dent  announced  in  2002  and  2003  respectively.  My  district  is,  of  course,  home  to
Argonne  National  Laboratory,  which  has  a  strong  fuel  cell  R&D  program.  My  dis-
trict also is home to small businesses like H2Fuels and various auto parts suppliers,
corporations  like  BP,  and  research  organizations  like  the  Gas  Technology  Institute.
In  short,  I  have  the  privilege  to  represent  a  region  that  has  much  to  contribute  to
the continued development of fuel cells and the hydrogen needed to fuel them.

As I’ve said many times before, I do not believe that affordable energy and a clean
and  safe  environment  are  mutually  exclusive.  America  has  the  ingenuity  and  the
expertise to meet our future energy demands and promote energy conservation, and
we can do so in environmentally responsible ways that set a standard for the world.
Most importantly, America now has the motivation perhaps like no other time since
the  oil  crisis  of  the  ‘70’s  -  to  find  newer  and  better  ways  to  meet  our  energy  needs.
There  clearly  are  many  compelling  reasons  to  work  towards  our  shared  vision  of
a  hydrogen  economy.  Today,  we  will  hear  testimony  not  only  about  the  progress
DOE  has  made  already  in  hydrogen  research  but  also  about  those  research  ques-
tions—both basic and applied—that remain as questions yet to be solved. While we
want  to  know  about  any  potential  scientific  or  technical  ‘‘showstoppers,’’  we  also
want  to  know  whether  there  are  any  new  problems  that  have  been  identified  as  a
result of on-going research. We will hear testimony about how DOE is incorporating
the results of basic research needs for a hydrogen economy into the research agenda
for  the  hydrogen  initiative.  Finally,  we  will  hear  how  the  Department’s  hydrogen
research agenda has been modified to account for anticipated future policy decisions,
as suggested by the National Academy of Sciences.

It  is  clear  that  the  vision  of  a  hydrogen  economy  is  a  tremendously  challenging
endeavor.  But,  it  is  also  clear  that  it  will  take  us  many  years  to  reach  our  goal.
Once they become available, hydrogen vehicles will require a number of years until
they  compose  a  significant  part  of  the  automobile  fleet.  The  NAS  estimates  that
sales  of  hydrogen  vehicles  will  not  be  significant  enough  for  the  full  benefits  of  a
hydrogen  economy  to  be  realized  at  least  until  2025.  In  light  of  that,  we  need  to
next ask, ‘‘Are we working to meet our goals in the best way that we can?’’

I  would  also  observe  that  during  the  transition  to  a  hydrogen  economy,  many
technologies  developed  for  hydrogen  vehicles—such  as  hybrid  systems  technology
and advanced lightweight materials—could be deployed in conventional automobiles
to  provide  reduced  oil  dependence  and  emissions.  Congress  and  the  Administration
need  to  understand  whether  we  can  design  proper  incentives  so  that  those  tech-
nologies  are  deployed  for  improving  the  fuel  economy  of  conventional  automobiles,
rather  than  continuing  an  exclusive  focus  on  ever  increasing  performance,  as  has
been  the  norm  for  the  past  twenty  years.  We  need  to  next  ask,  ‘‘Are  we  getting  all
the benefits we can from our investment in hydrogen research?’’

Our  job  at  this  hearing  is  to  look  at  what  we’ve  learned  in  our  initial  research
efforts, and to gain insight into whether we have an appropriately balanced research
effort.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  more  about  how  the  DOE  is  moving  the  Nation
ever-closer to realizing the promise and potential of fuel cells and hydrogen.

Thank you.
Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  But  before  we  hear  from  them,  I  want  to
recognize  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Energy  Subcommittee,  Mr.
Honda from California, for his opening statement.

Mr.  HONDA.  Thank  you,  Madame  Chair,  and  I  do  appreciate  the

Chair’s work in putting this hearing together.

At  a  Full  Committee  hearing  held  earlier  this  year,  we  heard
about  two  reports,  which  suggested  that  resources  should  be  di-
rected  away  from  demonstration  projects  and  towards  more  basic
R&D  because  there  are  significant  technical  barriers  to  overcome.
I  agree  that  there  are  many  technical  barriers  to  be  overcome,
but  I  also  note  that  demonstration  programs  have  served  to  help
us identify some of those technical barriers.

I hope that the witnesses can comment on the role that the—that
investments  made  in  demonstration  projects  by  other  agencies  can
play in helping the Department of Energy’s work to make hydrogen
feasible.  For  example,  the  Santa  Clara  Valley  Transportation
Authority’s Zero-Emission Bus program is funded by a transit sales
tax,  the  Federal  Transit  Administration,  the  California  Energy
Commission, and the Bay Air Quality Management District.

It will be useful to know whether DOE is able to work with pro-
grams  like  this  to  gain  knowledge  about  the  infrastructure  needs
and identify potential technical obstacles that we will need to over-
come.

Finally,  we  must  remember  that  hydrogen  is  not  an  energy
source, it is an energy carrier. We cannot afford to look at only the
hydrogen  piece  of  the  puzzle.  We  must  figure  out  where  we  are
going to get that hydrogen.

I  hope  that  the  witnesses  will  discuss  whether  we  are  doing  the
necessary  work  to  develop  the  electricity-generating  infrastructure
that will clearly be necessary to provide the fuel for hydrogen vehi-
cles.

I  look  forward  to  this  hearing  and  hope  that  the  witnesses  can
address some of these concerns. And I yield back the balance of my
time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Honda follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairman Inglis, Chairwoman Biggert, Ranking Member Hooley, thank you all for
holding  this  hearing  today  to  receive  updates  on  the  progress  that  is  being  made
in addressing technical barriers to the use of hydrogen in vehicles.

At a Full Committee hearing held earlier this year, we heard testimony about two
reports which suggested that resources should be directed away from demonstration
projects  and  towards  more  basic  R&D  because  there  are  significant  technical  bar-
riers to overcome.

I agree with the conclusion that there are many technical barriers to be overcome,
and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses  their  thoughts  on  the  break-
throughs they believe will need to be made in order to overcome these barriers.

But I also note that prior demonstration programs have served to help to identify
some  of  the  very  technical  barriers  that  an  increased  emphasis  on  research  would
aim to overcome. I fear that we might miss more obstacles until after we have made
significant  investments  of  time  and  resources  if  we  stop  working  on  demonstration
projects.

I hope that the witnesses can comment on the role that investments made in dem-
onstration  projects  by  other  agencies  can  play  in  helping  the  Department  of  Ener-
gy’s work to make hydrogen feasible. For example, the Santa Clara Valley Transpor-
tation  Authority’s  Zero  Emission  Bus  program  is  funded  by  a  transit  sales  tax,  the
Federal  Transit  Administration  (FTA),  the  California  Energy  Commission  (CEC),
and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.

It  will  be  useful  to  know  whether  DOE  is  able  to  work  with  programs  like  this
to gain knowledge about infrastructure needs and identify potential technical obsta-
cles that we will need to overcome.

Finally, we must remember that hydrogen is not an energy source, it is an energy
carrier.  We  cannot  just  look  at  the  hydrogen  piece  of  the  equation,  assuming  that
an  infinite  supply  of  fuel  will  be  available  for  vehicles  if  only  we  can  make  those
vehicles.

Where is the energy going to come from to produce hydrogen? Converting natural

gas is one option, but supplies of that fuel are already limited.

Barring  that,  a  switch  to  hydrogen  vehicles  looks  like  it  will  also  require  a  com-
mensurate increase electricity generating capacity to supply the fuel. I hope the wit-
nesses will discuss whether we are undertaking the necessary efforts to address this
critical piece of the puzzle.

I look forward to this hearing, and hope the witnesses can address some of these

concerns. I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Honda.
Any  additional  opening  statement  submitted  by  the  Members

may be added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to examine the progress that has been made in hydrogen research since the launch
of  the  President’s  Hydrogen  Initiative.  A  greater  reliance  on  hydrogen  requires
modification  of  our  existing  energy  infrastructure  to  ensure  greater  availability  of
this  new  fuel  source.  Making  the  transition  to  a  hydrogen  economy  will  require  an
enormous  investment  to  create  a  new  infrastructure.  It  is  my  understanding  that
the Department of Energy is initiating an effort to better understand the economics
and  influences  of  policy  incentives  on  a  possible  transition  to  hydrogen.  Since  the
President’s  Initiative  has  left  many  questions  unanswered,  I  am  hopeful  our  wit-
nesses  here  today  will  provide  more  insight  into  the  funding  and  technology  chal-
lenges facing the Hydrogen Initiative.

I  agree  that  a  hydrogen-based  economy  could  have  important  benefits  that  could
help  relieve  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.  First,  hydrogen  can  be  manufactured
from a variety of sources, such as coal. I strongly support the President’s Integrated
Sequestration  and  Hydrogen  Research  Initiative,  entitled  FutureGen,  which  is  a
coal-fired  electric  and  hydrogen  production  plant.  The  prototype  plant  will  serve  as
a large-scale engineering laboratory for testing and will expand the options for pro-
ducing hydrogen from coal.

As the Administration begins to consider locations for the new plant, I would hope
they  would  consider  Southern  Illinois.  I  have  led  the  effort  to  locate  FutureGen  in
Illinois, including leading a bipartisan effort in the House to secure funding for the
project. The region is rich in high-sulfur coal reserves and the Coal Center at South-
ern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU–C) has been doing extensive work with hy-
drogen and coal. The geology of the region is well suited to the carbon-trapping tech-
nology  to  be  developed  and  Illinois  is  home  to  oil  and  gas  reserves  and  deep  saline
aquifers that can permanently sequester carbon dioxide.

I have been tracking this issue closely since its inception and I am anxious to see
the  Department’s  program  plan.  This  Administration  has  touted  FutureGen  as  one
of  the  most  important  climate  change  technologies  at  our  disposal  and  heightened
its  international  visibility  to  extraordinary  levels  and  I  am  committed  to  working
with my colleagues and the Administration to move forward on a path that is tech-
nically, financially, and politically viable.

I  again  thank  the  witnesses  for  being  with  us  today  and  providing  testimony  to

our committee.

Let  me  thank  Chairwoman  Biggert  and  Ranking  Member  Honda  of  the  Energy
Subcommittee  as  well  as  Chairman  Inglis  and  Ranking  Member  Holley  of  the  Re-
search  Subcommittee  for  holding  this  joint  hearing  on  the  future  of  hydrogen  en-
ergy.  Clearly,  hydrogen  technologies  hold  great  potential;  however  we  do  not  know
how  long  it  will  be  before  hydrogen  can  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  fuel
consumption.  I  hope  this  hearing  will  shed  some  light  on  the  path  that  we  must
take to make the potential of hydrogen into a reality.

nounced in 2002. Together, the initiatives aim to provide the technology for a hydro-
gen-based transportation economy, including production of hydrogen, transportation
and distribution of hydrogen, and the vehicles that will use the hydrogen. Fuel cell
cars  running  on  hydrogen  would  emit  only  water  vapor  and  provide  environmental
benefits in addition to being an alternative source of energy.

However,  as  I  stated  we  must  make  this  potential  in  to  a  reality  and  we  are  not
yet  at  that  point.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  recommended  changes
to  the  hydrogen  initiatives  in  its  2004  report,  The  Hydrogen  Economy:  Opportuni-
ties,  Costs,  Barriers,  and  R&D  Needs.  The  report  particularly  stressed  the  need  for
a  greater  emphasis  on  basic,  exploratory  research  because  of  the  significant  tech-
nical  barriers  that  must  be  overcome.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  has  re-
sponded by expanding the hydrogen program into the Office of Science, and has re-
quested  $33  million  for  fiscal  year  2006  (FY06)  to  fund  basic  research  efforts  in
DOE’s Office of Science.

The  fact  is  that  even  with  the  most  optimistic  of  assumptions,  it  will  take  some
time for hydrogen vehicles to compose a significant part of the automobile fleet. The
NAS estimates that sales of hydrogen vehicles will not be significant enough for the
full  benefits  of  a  hydrogen  economy  to  be  realized  at  least  until  2025.  But,  this
should not be a deterrent to developing hydrogen technology, instead it should serve
as incentive for the scientific community to move towards this technology that holds
so much promise.

While  in  this  transition  to  a  hydrogen  economy,  many  of  the  technologies  being
developed  for  hydrogen  vehicles,  such  as  hybrid  systems  technology  and  advanced
lightweight  materials  could  be  deployed  in  conventional  automobiles  to  provide  re-
duced oil dependence and emissions. Without the proper incentives, vehicle improve-
ments are likely to continue to be used to increase performance, rather than improv-
ing fuel economy, as they have been for the past twenty years. In fact the Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  estimates  that  if  today’s  vehicles  had  the  same  weight
and  acceleration  as  cars  did  in  1987,  they  would  get  20  percent  better  gas  mileage
due  to  technology  improvements.  I  sincerely  hope  that  we  use  our  resources  to  im-
prove gas mileage and make hydrogen technology a reality for the American public.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

I am pleased that we are holding this very important hearing this morning.
The  U.S.  Federal  Government  often  serves  the  role  of  jump-starting  research  in
fields that cannot be immediately lucrative, yet provide American citizens the prom-
ise  of  improved  health,  efficiency,  or  lifestyle.  We  again  find  ourselves  in  this  role,
and we must do our best to advance a hydrogen economy in this country.

I  am  particularly  interested  in  the  FreedomCAR  program  that  partners  with
DaimlerChrysler.  As  we  recognize  the  potential  of  FreedomCAR  and  the  hydrogen
initiative,  I  am  excited  about  the  promise  that  developments  in  this  field  may  pro-
vide for many of my constituents who are employees of Chrysler.

Furthermore,  I  would  like  to  recognize  the  good  research  being  conducted  at  the
University of Missouri on the Plug-In Hybrid Power System Partnership for Innova-
tion, a research project that will examine how regenerative fuel cell systems, which
produce high hydrogen and oxygen pressures, will be designed, fabricated and then
demonstrated in the laboratory.

Thank  you  for  your  willingness  to  join  us,  Mr.  Faulkner,  Dr.  Bodde,  Mr.

Chernoby, Dr. Crabtree and Dr. Heywood. I am eager to hear your testimony.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. And at this time, I would like to introduce
all of the witnesses and thank you for coming before us this morn-
ing.

First off, we have Mr. Douglas Faulkner. He is the Acting Assist-
ant  Secretary  for  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  at  the
Department of Energy. There is a lot of energy in there. Dr. David
Bodde, Director of Innovation and Public Policy at Clemson Univer-
sity’s  International  Center  for  Automotive  Research.  And  thank
you. Mr. Mark Chernoby, Vice President for Advance Vehicle Engi-
neering  at  the  DaimlerChrysler  Corporation.  Thank  you.  And  Dr.
George  Crabtree,  Director  of  the  Materials  Science  Division  at  Ar-
gonne  National  Laboratory,  a  familiar  place.  And  Dr.  John  Hey-

wood,  Director  of  the  Sloan  Automotive  Laboratory  at  the  Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. Welcome.

As  the  witnesses  probably  know,  spoken  testimony  will  be  lim-
ited  to  five  minutes  each,  after  which  the  Members  will  have  five
minutes each to ask questions. This is Wednesday and one of, prob-
ably,  our  busiest  days,  so  we  are  going  to  be  pretty  strict  on  the
time, if you can keep it to five minutes.

We will begin with Mr. Faulkner. And the fact that there are two

Committees here, we expect a lot of questions.

So we will begin with Mr. Faulkner.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  DOUGLAS  L.  FAULKNER,  ACTING  ASSIST-
ANT  SECRETARY,  ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND  RENEWABLE
ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Mr. FAULKNER. Thank you.
Madame  Chairman,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommit-
tees,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  today  to  testify  on  the  Depart-
ment’s hydrogen program.

Since President Bush launched the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative over
two years ago, we have made tremendous progress. We have imple-
mented  valuable  feedback  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences
and the Department’s Basic Energy Sciences Workshop and are al-
ready  seeing  results.  In  fact,  as  we  speak,  the  Academy  is  com-
pleting its biannual review of the program and will publish its find-
ings in coming weeks.

The Academy called for us to improve integration and balance of
activities within the relevant offices of the Department of Energy’s
Renewables, Nuclear, Fossil, Science, prioritizing the efforts within
and across program areas, establishing milestones, and go/no-go di-
rections.  We  have  done  this.  In  the  Hydrogen  Posture  Plan,  we
have identified strategies and milestones to enable a 2015 industry
commercialization  decision  on  the  viability  of  hydrogen  and  fuel
cell  technologies.  Each  office  has,  in  turn,  developed  a  detailed  re-
search  plan,  which  outlines  how  the  high-level  milestones  will  be
supported. We are now implementing these research plans, and we
are making tangible progress.

The Department competitively selected over $510 million in total
federal  funding  for  projects  to  address  critical  challenges.  Of  these
projects,  the  Office  of  Science  announced  70  new  competitively  se-
lected  projects,  $64  million  over  three  years.  Topics  include  new
materials for hydrogen storage and development of catalysts at the
nanoscale,  all  recommended  by  the  Basic  Energy  Sciences  Work-
shop. Sixty-five projects were initiated on hydrogen production and
delivery,  funded  at  $170  million  over  four  years.  And  the  results
here are already promising.

We  believe  we  can  meet  our  goal  of  $2  to  $3  gallon  of  gasoline
equivalent,  which  is  independent  of  the  production  pathway.  The
basic  research  component  of  the  program  is  especially  valuable  to
long-term  concepts,  such  as  photoelectrochemical  hydrogen  produc-
tion.  I  would  also  like  to  underscore  that  our  ultimate  hydrogen
production  strategy  is  carbon-neutral  and  emphasizes  resource  di-
versity.

We  launched  a  Grand  Challenge  focusing  on  materials  discovery
and  development  of  hydrogen  storage,  one  of  the  critical  tech-

nologies  for  the  hydrogen  economy.  We  established  a  National  Hy-
drogen Storage project at over $150 million over five years, includ-
ing  three  Centers  of  Excellence  with  multi-disciplinary  teams  of
university, industry, and federal laboratories.

Closely coordinated with the new Office of Science Research, our
activities  address  the  Academy’s  recommendation  to  shift  toward
more  exploratory  work  as  well  as  to  partner  with  a  broader  range
of academic and industrial organizations. We are already seeing re-
sults from this work, too.

Recent  progress  in  materials  discovery  allows  hydrogen  to  be
stored  at  low  temperature—low  pressures  and  modest  tempera-
tures.  We  need  both  fundamental  understanding  and  engineering
solutions  to  address  key  issues,  like  charging  and  discharging  hy-
drogen at practical temperatures and pressures.

To address fuel cell cost and durability, a new $75 million solici-
tation  will  soon  be  released,  complementing  the  current  $17.5  mil-
lion solicitation on new membrane materials as well as existing ef-
forts. Results are already being achieved.

As highlighted by Secretary Bodman in earlier Congressional tes-
timony,  this  high-volume  cost  of  automotive  fuel  cells  was  reduced
from  $275  per  kilowatt  to  $200  per  kilowatt.  And  the  Office  of
Science has initiated new basic research projects on nanoscale cata-
lysts and membrane materials for fuel cell design and applications.
Through  better  techniques  for  fabricating  electrodes  and  new
strategies  for  improved  durability,  we  believe  the  targets  we  have
set  are  achievable.  We  must  keep  sight  of  our  ultimate  goal  to
transfer research to the real world, and we have complemented our
research efforts with a learning demonstration activity. We conduct
research  on  safety  codes  and  standards  working  with  the  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation,  standards  development  organizations,  and
other organizations. We are also creating a road map now with the
Department of Commerce and other federal agencies for developing
manufacturing technologies to bridge the continuum from basic re-
search to commercialization. That effort will help attract new busi-
ness investment, create new high-technology jobs, and build a com-
petitive U.S. supply base.

The Academy also recommended a systems analysis and integra-
tion activity. We are developing that capability. Analysis of various
scenarios for hydrogen production delivery are underway. These ef-
forts will be valuable in providing rigorous data and potential guid-
ance for policy decisions in future years.

Madame  Chairman,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  DOE  hydrogen  program
is committed to a balanced portfolio. We do not do stand-alone test
tube research, but rather we have an integrated effort of basic, ap-
plied, and engineering sciences. This Committee, in particular, has
been instrumental in providing valuable guidance to us.

This  completes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  an-

swer any questions you have.

provide an overview and status update of the Hydrogen Program’s accomplishments
and plans.

Over  two  years  ago,  in  his  2003  State  of  the  Union  address,  President  Bush  an-
nounced  a  $1.2  billion  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  over  FY  2004—2008  to  reverse
America’s  growing  dependence  on  foreign  oil  by  developing  the  hydrogen  tech-
nologies  needed  for  commercially  viable  fuel  cells—a  way  to  power  cars,  trucks,
homes,  and  businesses  that  could  also  significantly  reduce  criteria  pollutants  and
greenhouse gas emissions. Since the launch of the Initiative, we have had many ac-
complishments  on  the  path  to  taking  hydrogen  and  fuel  cell  technologies  from  the
laboratory  to  the  showroom  in  2020,  following  an  industry  commercialization  deci-
sion  in  2015.  The  Department’s  Program  encompasses  the  research  and  develop-
ment (R&D) activities necessary to achieve the President’s vision, including basic re-
search,  applied  research  and  technology  development,  and  learning  demonstrations
that  are  an  extension  of  our  research.  These  activities  benefit  from  detailed  plan-
ning  efforts  conducted  by  the  Department,  and  the  National  Academies  study  and
the  Office  of  Science  Basic  Research  Needs  for  the  Hydrogen  Economy  workshop,
in  which  two  other  speakers  today,  Dr.  Bodde  and  Dr.  Crabtree,  have  made  major
contributions.  I  will  talk  about  progress  in  these  areas  as  we  continue  on  the  road
to solving the technical barriers that stand between us and this vision of a new en-
ergy future.
Hydrogen Vision and Overview

As a nation, we must work to ensure that we have access to energy that does not
require  us  to  compromise  our  security  or  our  environment.  Hydrogen  offers  the  op-
portunity to end petroleum dependence and to virtually eliminate transportation-re-
lated greenhouse gas emissions by addressing the root causes of these issues. Petro-
leum  imports  already  supply  more  than  55  percent  of  U.S.  domestic  petroleum  re-
quirements, and those imports are projected to account for 68 percent by 2025 under
a  business-as-usual  scenario.  Transportation  accounts  for  more  than  two-thirds  of
the  oil  use  in  the  United  States,  and  vehicles  contribute  to  the  Nation’s  air  quality
problems and greenhouse gas emissions because they release criteria pollutants and
carbon dioxide.

At the G8 Summit earlier this month, President Bush reiterated his policy of pro-
moting technological innovation, like the development of hydrogen and fuel cell tech-
nologies,  to  address  climate  change,  reduce  air  pollution,  and  improve  energy  secu-
rity  in  the  United  States  and  throughout  the  world.  The  Department’s  R&D  in  ad-
vanced  vehicle  technologies,  such  as  gasoline  hybrid  electric  vehicles,  will  help  im-
prove  energy  efficiency  and  offset  growth  in  the  transportation  fleet  in  the  near-  to
mid-term.  But,  for  the  long-term,  we  ultimately  need  a  substitute  to  replace  petro-
leum. Hydrogen and fuel cells, when combined, have the potential to provide carbon-
free, pollution-free power for transportation.

Hydrogen will be produced from diverse domestic energy resources, which include
biomass,  fossil  fuels,  nuclear  energy,  solar,  wind,  and  other  renewables.  We  have
planned  and  are  executing  a  balanced  research  portfolio  for  developing  hydrogen
production  and  delivery  technologies.  The  Department’s  hydrogen  production  strat-
egy  recognizes  that  most  hydrogen  will  likely  be  produced  by  technologies  that  do
not  require  a  new  hydrogen  delivery  infrastructure  in  the  transition  to  a  hydrogen
economy, such as distributed reforming of natural gas and of renewable liquid fuels
like  ethanol  and  methanol.  As  research,  development,  and  demonstration  efforts
progress  along  renewable,  nuclear,  and  clean  coal  pathways,  a  suite  of  technologies
will  become  available  to  produce  hydrogen  from  a  diverse  array  of  domestic  re-
sources. These technologies will be commercialized as market penetration grows and
demand for hydrogen increases.

The  economic  viability  of  these  different  production  pathways  will  be  strongly  af-
fected  by  regional  factors,  such  as  feedstock  or  energy  source  availability  and  cost,
delivery approaches, and the regulatory environment so that each region will tailor
its  hydrogen  infrastructure  to  take  advantage  of  its  particular  resources.  Our  ulti-
mate hydrogen production strategy is carbon-neutral and emphasizes diversity. Dur-
ing the transition, net carbon emissions on a well-to-wheels basis, from vehicles run-
ning on hydrogen produced from natural gas would be 25 percent less than gasoline
hybrid  vehicles  and  50  percent  less  than  conventional  internal  combustion  engine
vehicles. Natural gas is not a long-term strategy because of import concerns and the
demands  of  other  economic  sectors  for  natural  gas.  In  the  long-term,  in  a  hydrogen
economy  using  renewables,  nuclear,  and  coal  with  sequestration,  near-zero  carbon
light  duty  vehicles  are  our  goal.  I  want  to  emphasize  that  hydrogen  from  coal  will
be  produced  directly  from  gasification,  not  coal-based  electricity.  This  is  consistent
with technology currently under development for carbon capture and sequestration.

My testimony today will specifically address the Subcommittees’ questions:

1. What progress has been made toward addressing the principal technical
barriers  to  a  successful  transition  to  the  use  of  hydrogen  as  a  primary
transportation  fuel  since  the  Administration  announced  its  hydrogen
initiatives,  FreedomCAR  and  the  President’s  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative?
What are the remaining potential technical ‘‘showstoppers?’’

Progress and Accomplishments

Since the President launched the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, we have made tremen-
dous progress. The Department has developed a comprehensive technology develop-
ment  plan,  the  Hydrogen  Posture  Plan,  fully  integrating  the  hydrogen  research  of
the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; Science; Fossil Energy; and
Nuclear  Energy,  Science,  and  Technology.  This  plan  identifies  technologies,  strate-
gies,  and  interim  milestones  to  enable  a  2015  industry  commercialization  decision
on the viability of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Each Office has, in turn, de-
veloped  a  detailed  research  plan  which  outlines  how  the  high-level  milestones  will
be supported.

We are now implementing these research, development, and demonstration plans:
— Using  FY  2004  and  FY  2005  appropriations  and  contingent  upon  future  ap-
propriations  over  the  next  three  years,  the  Department  competitively  se-
lected over $510 million in projects ($755 million with cost-share) to address
critical challenges such as fuel cell cost, hydrogen storage, hydrogen produc-
tion  and  delivery  cost,  diverse  ways  of  producing  hydrogen,  as  well  as  re-
search for hydrogen safety, codes and standards.

— Of  this  total,  65  projects  are  for  hydrogen  production  and  delivery,  funded
at $107 million over four years. These include hydrogen production from re-
newables, distributed natural gas, coal, and nuclear sources.

— We initiated three Centers of Excellence and 15 independent projects in Hy-
drogen  Storage  at  $150  million  over  five  years.  The  Centers  include  20  uni-
versities, nine federal laboratories and eight industry partners, representing
a concerted, multi-disciplinary effort to address on-board vehicular hydrogen
storage—one  of  the  critical  enabling  technologies  for  a  hydrogen  economy.
These  activities  are  closely  coordinated  with  the  Office  of  Science  research
in hydrogen storage.

— To  address  fuel  cell  cost  and  durability,  five  new  projects  were  initiated  at
$13 million over three years. A new $75 million solicitation will be released
this  fall  to  address  cost  and  durability  of  fuel  cell  systems.  This  is  in  con-
junction with a $17.5 million solicitation currently open focusing on R&D ad-
dressing new membrane materials.

— We  established  a  national  vehicle  and  infrastructure  ‘‘learning  demonstra-
tion’’  project  at  $170  million  over  six  years,  with  an  additional  50  percent
cost  share  by  industry.  This  effort  takes  some  of  the  research  from  the  lab-
oratory  to  the  real  world,  and  is  critical  to  measuring  progress  and  to  pro-
viding feedback to our R&D efforts.

— Most  recently,  to  address  basic  science  for  the  hydrogen  economy,  70  new
projects were selected by the Office of Science at $64 million over three years
to  address  the  fundamental  science  underpinning  hydrogen  production,  de-
livery, storage, and use. Topics of this basic research include novel materials
for  hydrogen  storage,  membranes  for  hydrogen  separation  and  purification,
designs of catalysts at the nanoscale, solar hydrogen production, and bio-in-
spired materials and processes. Such research is important for exploring fun-
damental  science  that  may  be  applicable  in  the  long-term  and  is  responsive
to the National Academies’ report recommending a shift to more exploratory
research.

With  these  new  competitively  selected  awards,  the  best  scientists  and  engineers

from around the Nation are actively engaged. The stage is now set for results.
Technical Progress

Ongoing research has already led to important technical progress.

— As  highlighted  by  Secretary  Bodman  in  earlier  Congressional  testimony,  I
am pleased to report that our fuel cell activities recently achieved an impor-
tant technology cost goal—the high-volume cost of automotive fuel cells was
reduced from $275 per kilowatt to $200 per kilowatt. This was accomplished
by using innovative processes developed by national labs and fuel cell devel-
opers for depositing platinum catalyst. This accomplishment is a major step
toward  the  Program’s  goal  of  reducing  the  cost  of  transportation  fuel  cell
power systems to $45 per kilowatt by 2010.

— In hydrogen production, we have demonstrated our ability to produce hydro-
gen at a cost of $3.60 per gallon of gasoline equivalent at an integrated fuel-
ing  station  that  generates  both  electricity  and  hydrogen.  This  is  down  from
about $5.00 per gallon of gasoline equivalent prior to the Initiative.

— To  ensure  a  balanced  portfolio,  we  must  keep  sight  of  our  ultimate  goal  to
transfer research to the real world and we have complemented our research
efforts  with  a  ‘learning  demonstration’  activity.  Most  importantly,  with  the
‘learning  demonstration’  activity  we  have  the  key  industries  that  will  ulti-
mately have to invest in the hydrogen economy, the auto and energy compa-
nies, working together to ensure seamless integration of customer acceptable
technology.  This  activity  will  evaluate  vehicle  and  refueling  infrastructure
technologies  under  real-world  conditions  and  is  key  to  measuring  progress
toward technical targets and to help focus R&D.

2. What  are  the  research  areas  where  breakthroughs  are  needed  to  ad-
vance  a  hydrogen  economy?  How  has  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)
responded to the report by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) call-
ing  for  an  increased  emphasis  on  basic  research?  How  is  DOE  incor-
porating the results of the Basic Energy Sciences workshop on basic re-
search  needs  for  a  hydrogen  economy  into  the  research  agenda  for  the
hydrogen initiative?
Starting in FY 2005, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science has been
included  in  the  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  in  order  to  focus  basic  research  on  over-
coming key technology hurdles in hydrogen production, storage, and conversion. The
Office  of  Science-funded  research  seeks  fundamental  understanding  in  areas  such
as  non-precious-metal  catalysts,  membranes  for  fuel  cells  and  hydrogen  separation,
multi-functional  nanoscale  structures,  biological  and  photoelectrochemical  hydrogen
production, and modeling and analytical tools.

For  example,  basic  research  can  help  address  the  critical  challenge  of  hydrogen
storage:  How  do  you  safely  store  hydrogen  on  board  a  vehicle  to  enable  customer
expectations  of  greater  than  300  mile  driving  range,  without  compromising  pas-
senger  or  cargo  space?  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  recommended  ‘‘a
shift. . .away from some development areas towards more exploratory work’’ to ad-
dress issues like storage, stating that ‘‘the probability of success is greatly increased
by  partnering  with  a  broader  range  of  academic  and  industrial  organizations. . .’’
Through  the  Department’s  ‘‘Grand  Challenge’’  solicitation,  a  ‘‘National  Hydrogen
Storage Project’’ was established to broaden our scope. The new awards in basic re-
search, with an additional $20 million for 17 projects over three years supported by
the  Office  of  Science,  are  integrated  into  this  national  project  and  provide  value  in
developing  a  fundamental  understanding  of  hydrogen  interactions  with  materials.
These  multi-disciplinary  efforts  focused  on  materials-based  technology  for  hydrogen
storage,  directly  address  the  recommendations  from  the  Basic  Energy  Sciences
workshop  on  basic  research  needs  for  a  hydrogen  economy.  By  implementing  the
NAS recommendations, recent progress in materials discovery and technology allows
hydrogen to be stored at low pressures and modest temperatures. Further basic and
applied research will lead to better fundamental understanding and engineering so-
lutions  to  address  some  of  the  key  storage  issues  such  as  charging  and  discharging
hydrogen  at  practical  temperatures  and  pressures.  Rather  than  ‘stand  alone’  test
tube research, we have an integrated effort to address basic, applied, and engineer-
ing sciences to develop materials and systems for storing hydrogen.

We  face  another  set  of  challenges  in  hydrogen  production.  In  this  area,  our  re-
search efforts are focused on reducing cost, improving energy efficiencies, and ensur-
ing a diversity of pathways based on domestic resources for energy security that do
not  result  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Some  pathways  are  further  along  in  devel-
opment  and  will  be  commercially  viable  sooner  than  others.  For  the  transition,  we
envision producing hydrogen from natural gas or renewable liquids such as ethanol,
at the fueling point, thus eliminating the need for a dedicated hydrogen distribution
network.  Centralized  hydrogen  production  from  coal  with  sequestration,  biomass,
nuclear, and distribution networks can follow later once market penetration justifies
the capital investment required. Basic science is critical to understanding materials
performance,  failure  mechanisms,  and  theoretical  technology  limits.  The  basic  re-
search  component  of  the  program  contributes  to  longer-term  concepts  such  as
photocatalytic 
direct
photoelectrochemical  conversion  to  produce  hydrogen.  In  fact,  we  have  nearly  $20
million  of  federal  funding  in  new  projects  selected  by  the  Office  of  Science  on  solar
hydrogen  production,  membranes  for  separation  and  purification,  and  for  bio-in-
spired materials and processes.

As for fuel cells, key issues are cost and durability. Significant progress has been
made by national laboratories as well as industry to reduce the amount of platinum,
and  hence  cost,  within  the  fuel  cell  electrode.  In  addition  to  the  targeted  activities
in  fuel  cells  previously  mentioned,  the  Office  of  Science  has  initiated  new  basic  re-
search projects on the design of catalysts at the nanoscale and membrane materials
related to fuel cell applications. More effective catalysts, combined with better tech-
niques  for  fabricating  these  membrane  electrode  assemblies  and  new  strategies  for
improved durability of fuel cells, will enable us to meet the aggressive cost and per-
formance  targets  we  have  set  for  fuel  cells.  We  are  also  expanding  our  activities  to
include  manufacturing  issues  that  will  help  take  these  new  technologies  from  the
laboratory to the marketplace.
3. The NAS report suggested that the research agenda should be developed
with  future  policy  decisions  in  mind.  How  has  DOE  increased  its  policy
analysis  capabilities  as  recommended  by  the  NAS?  How  will  the  results
of that analysis be applied to the research agenda?
I would like to emphasize that this Program is a research effort. However, as stat-
ed  earlier,  in  response  to  the  National  Academies’  recommendation,  the  Program
has established the Systems Analysis and Integration effort to provide a disciplined
approach  to  the  research,  design,  development,  and  validation  of  complex  systems.
A fact-based analytical approach will be used to develop a balanced portfolio of R&D
projects  to  support  the  development  of  production,  delivery,  storage,  fuel  cell,  and
safety  technologies.  Through  analysis,  the  impact  of  individual  components  on  the
hydrogen energy system as a whole will be evaluated and the interaction of the com-
ponents and their effects on the system will be assessed. Systems Analysis and Inte-
gration efforts will be available to examine and understand the cost implications of
policy  and  regulations  on  technology  R&D  direction.  Analysis  of  various  scenarios
for hydrogen production and delivery is critical to the transition plan for developing
the  infrastructure  and  carbon-neutral  hydrogen  resources  for  a  hydrogen  economy.
The  planned  analysis  efforts  will  be  valuable  in  providing  rigorous  data  and  poten-
tial guidance for policy decisions in future years.
4. How is DOE conducting planning for, and analysis of, the policy changes
(such  as  incentives  or  regulation)  that  might  be  required  to  encourage
a  transition  to  hydrogen?  What  other  agencies  are  involved  in  planning
for, or facilitating, such a transition?
Currently,  the  focus  of  the  DOE  Hydrogen  Program  is  research  and  development
to  address  key  technical  challenges.  Research  and  development  on  the  codes  and
standards  necessary  to  implementing  hydrogen  and  fuel  cell  technologies  will  form
a scientific and technical basis for future regulations. We are actively working with
the Department of Transportation and interface with Standards Development Orga-
nizations  (SDOs)  and  Codes  Development  Organizations  (CDOs)  on  safety,  codes
and standards.

As part of the Systems Analysis efforts, we have started to model and explore op-
tions  and  pathways  to  achieve  a  successful  transition  to  hydrogen.  This  effort  is  in
collaboration  with  the  Vehicle  Technology  Office  and  the  overall  Energy  Efficiency
and  Renewable  Energy  modeling  efforts.  The  Energy  Information  Administration
(EIA)  is  also  providing  guidance.  This  work  includes  the  incorporation  of  rigorous
hydrogen production, delivery, and vehicle technology components into the National
Energy  Management  System  (NEMS)  model  architecture,  as  well  development  of  a
more  detailed  transportation  sector  model  that  includes  conventional,  hybrid,  and
alternative  fuel  options.  These  modeling  efforts  will  also  allow  us  to  examine  the
potential  impacts  of  policy  and  regulations  on  the  introduction  and  long-term  use
of hydrogen.
Now I will talk about our partners and our future plans.

We  are  working  with  partners  on  all  fronts  to  address  the  challenges  to  a  hydro-
gen  economy.  Under  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership,  DOE  is  collaborating
with the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and five major energy com-
panies  to  help  identify  and  evaluate  technologies  that  will  meet  customer  require-
ments  and  establish  the  business  case.  Technical  teams  of  research  managers  from
the  automotive  and  energy  industries  and  DOE  are  meeting  regularly  to  establish
and update technology roadmaps in each technology area.

An  Interagency  Hydrogen  R&D  Task  Force  has  been  established  by  the  White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to leverage resources and co-
ordinate interrelated and complementary research across the entire Federal Govern-
ment.  In  2005,  the  Task  Force  has  initiated  a  plan  to  coordinate  a  number  of  key
research activities among the eight major agencies that fund hydrogen and fuel cell

research.  Coordination  topics  include  novel  materials  for  fuel  cells  and  hydrogen
storage,  inexpensive  and  durable  catalysts,  hydrogen  production  from  alternative
sources,  stationary  fuel  cells,  and  fuel-cell  vehicle  demonstrations.  The  Task  Force
has  also  launched  a  website,  Hydrogen.gov.  In  the  coming  year,  the  OSTP  Task
Force plans to sponsor an expert panel on the contributions that nanoscale research
can make to realizing a Hydrogen Economy.

Last  year,  we  announced  the  establishment  of  the  International  Partnership  for
the Hydrogen Economy, or the IPHE. IPHE, which now includes 16 nations and the
European Commission, establishes world-wide collaboration on hydrogen technology.
The nations have agreed to work cooperatively toward a unifying goal: practical, af-
fordable, competitively-priced hydrogen vehicles and refueling by 2020; and projects
involving collaboration between different countries are being proposed and reviewed
for selection.
Toward the Hydrogen Future

The  Department  is  looking  to  the  future  as  well.  Just  as  we  have  made  tremen-
dous progress, we plan to have significant advances to report next year on the R&D
projects  we  have  launched  through  the  solicitations  I  mentioned.  The  progress  will
be tracked using performance-based technical and cost milestones that provide clear
and  quantifiable  measures.  We  will  report  this  progress  next  year  to  this  Sub-
committee, and annually to Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget.
In fact, as we speak, the NAS is completing its biennial review of the program. We
anticipate  more  valuable  feedback  and  will  have  more  details  to  report  in  the  com-
ing months.

For  the  critical  targets,  it  is  important  that  we  verify  our  progress  in  a  way  that
is independent and transparent. In Fiscal Year 2006, the major technical milestones
will  be  assessed  using  a  rigorous  methodology  established  by  the  Hydrogen  Pro-
gram.

— First,  in  Hydrogen  Storage,  we  will  determine  the  maximum  storage  poten-
tial  of  cryogenic-compressed  hydrogen  tanks  and  the  feasibility  of  this  tech-
nology towards meeting DOE’s 2010 targets.

— Second,  in  Fuel  Cells,  we  will  evaluate  fuel  cell  cost  per  kilowatt  using  cur-
rent materials to determine if $110/kilowatt is feasible towards meeting the
2010 target of $45/kilowatt (assuming high volume manufacturing).

— And  third,  in  Hydrogen  Production,  we  will  determine  if  the  laboratory  re-
search will lead to $3 per gasoline gallon energy equivalent (gge) using a dis-
tributed natural gas reformer system.

In addition to measuring progress, we continue to develop and improve processes
to facilitate innovation and to accelerate R&D. For instance, we plan an annual so-
licitation,  starting  in  2006,  in  the  critical  area  of  hydrogen  storage  to  complement
the Centers of Excellence. This will improve our flexibility to continuously evaluate
new ideas and rapidly fund competitively selected projects.

Validation of fuel cell vehicle and hydrogen infrastructure technologies under ‘real
world’ operating conditions is essential to track progress and to help guide research
priorities. Technology and infrastructure validation will provide essential statistical
data on the status of fuel cell vehicle and infrastructure technologies relative to tar-
gets  in  the  areas  of  efficiency,  durability,  storage  system  range,  and  fuel  cost.  This
activity will also provide information to support the development of codes and stand-
ards for the commercial use of hydrogen, and feedback on vehicle and infrastructure
safety. Through cost-shared partnerships with the energy industry, Fiscal Year 2006
activities  include  opening  eight  hydrogen  fueling  stations,  and  validating  perform-
ance, safety, and cost of hydrogen production and delivery technologies. By 2009, the
program  is  expected  to  validate  fuel  cell  vehicle  durability  of  2,000  hours,  a  250-
mile  vehicle  range,  and  full-scale  hydrogen  production  cost  of  less  than  $3.00  gge.
In addition, a critical need for lowering the costs of hydrogen and fuel cells is high
volume manufacturing processes and techniques. Manufacturing R&D challenges for
a hydrogen economy include developing innovative, low-cost fabrication processes for
new  materials  and  applications  and  adapting  laboratory  fabrication  techniques  to
enable high volume manufacturing. The Hydrogen Program is working with Depart-
ment  of  Commerce  and  other  federal  agencies  to  create  a  roadmap  for  developing
manufacturing technologies for hydrogen and fuel cell systems as part of the Presi-
dent’s  Manufacturing  Initiative.  The  roadmap  will  help  to  guide  budget  requests  in
Fiscal  Year  2007  and  beyond.  This  work  is  part  of  the  Interagency  Working  Group
on Manufacturing R&D, which is chaired by OSTP and includes 14 federal agencies.
The  working  group  has  identified  nanomanufacturing,  manufacturing  R&D  for  the
hydrogen  economy,  and  intelligent  and  integrated  manufacturing  systems  as  three
focus  areas  for  the  future.  Manufacturing  R&D  for  the  hydrogen  economy  will  be

critical  in  formulating  a  strategy  to  transfer  technology  successes  in  the  laboratory
to new jobs, new investments, and a competitive U.S. supplier base in a global econ-
omy.

Successful  commercialization  of  hydrogen  technologies  requires  a  comprehensive
database on component reliability and safety, published performance-based domestic
standards,  and  international  standards  or  regulations  that  will  allow  the  tech-
nologies to compete in a global market. Initial codes and standards for the commer-
cial  use  of  hydrogen  are  only  now  starting  to  be  published.  Research  will  be  con-
ducted  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  to  determine  flammability  limits  and  the  reactive  and
depressive  properties  of  hydrogen  under  various  conditions,  and  also  to  quantify
risk.  Through  such  efforts,  critical  data  will  be  generated  to  help  write  and  adopt
standards and to develop improved safety systems and criteria.
Conclusion

Madam  Chairman,  all  the  panelists  here  today  will  agree  that  achieving  the  vi-
sion  of  the  hydrogen  energy  future  is  a  great  challenge.  The  DOE  Hydrogen  Pro-
gram is committed to a balanced portfolio, conducting the basic and applied research
necessary  to  achieve  this  vision.  It  will  require  careful  planning  and  coordination,
public education, technology development, and substantial public and private invest-
ments.  It  will  require  a  broad  political  consensus  and  a  bipartisan  approach  to
achieving the President’s vision. We appreciate the leadership taken by the Senate,
and most recently the House, in establishing Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Caucuses. By
being bold and innovative, we can change the way we do business here in America;
we  can  change  our  dependence  upon  foreign  sources  of  energy;  we  can  address  the
root cause of greenhouse gas emissions; we can help with the quality of the air; and
we  can  make  a  fundamental  difference  for  the  future  of  our  children.  This  com-
mittee in particular has been instrumental in providing that kind of leadership over
the years, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue in the months and years
ahead.

We  at  the  Department  of  Energy  welcome  the  challenge  and  opportunity  to  play
a  vital  role  in  this  nation’s  energy  future  and  to  help  address  our  energy  security
challenges  in  such  a  fundamental  way.  This  completes  my  prepared  statement.  I
would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

Douglas Faulkner was appointed by President George W. Bush on June 29, 2001,
to  serve  as  the  political  deputy  in  the  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable
Energy  (EERE).  This  $1.2  billion  research  and  development  organization  has  over
five  hundred  federal  employees  in  Washington,  D.C.  and  six  regional  offices,  sup-
ported  by  thousands  of  contractors  at  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory
and elsewhere.

Mr.  Faulkner  oversees  all  aspects  of  EERE’s  operations  in  a  close  partnership
with  the  Office’s  two  career  Deputy  Assistant  Secretaries.  He  has  worked  closely
with  Assistant  Secretary  David  K.  Garman  to  reorganize  EERE,  replacing  an  out-
dated and fragmented organization with what arguably is the most innovative busi-
ness  model  ever  used  in  the  Federal  Government.  This  has  resulted  in  fewer  man-
agement  layers,  fewer  but  more  productive  staff,  streamlined  procedures,  stronger
project  management  in  the  field  and  lower  operating  costs  overall.  These  reforms
have been recognized as a success by the White House and the National Association
of Public Administration.

Mr. Faulkner organized and led an internal management board which completely
revamped  EERE’s  biomass  programs.  Many  projects  were  ended  and  those  funds
pooled for an unprecedented solicitation to refocus R&D for new bio-refineries.

Interviews of Mr. Faulkner about renewable energy and energy efficiency have ap-

peared on television and radio and in the print media.

Before  assuming  his  leadership  post  in  EERE,  Mr.  Faulkner  had  progressed  rap-
idly  through  the  ranks  of  the  civil  service  at  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  and
the Department of Energy. In his over-twenty year career he rose from junior China
intelligence  analyst  to  a  nationally-recognized  leader  in  bio-based  products  and  a
senior policy advisor to the Secretaries of Energy in both Bush Administrations.

Born  and  raised  in  central  Illinois,  Principal  Deputy  Faulkner  received  a  Bach-
elor’s  degree  in  Asian  Studies  from  the  University  of  Illinois  and  a  Master’s  degree
from  the  Johns  Hopkins  University,  School  of  Advanced  International  Studies.  He
also attended the University of Singapore as a Rotary Scholar. At these institutions,
he  studied  French  and  Mandarin  Chinese  languages.  Mr.  Faulkner  played  inter-
collegiate basketball at home and abroad.

He  is  involved  in  his  church  and  community  as  well  as  Boy  Scouts  and  youth
baseball.  Mr.  Faulkner  was  appointed  in  the  early  1990s  to  two  Arlington  County,
Virginia, economic commissions.

Mr. Faulkner lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his wife and son.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much.
And then, Dr. Bodde, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID L. BODDE, DIRECTOR, INNOVATION
AND  PUBLIC  POLICY,  INTERNATIONAL  CENTER  FOR  AUTO-
MOTIVE RESEARCH, CLEMSON UNIVERSITY
Dr. BODDE. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
I would like to speak this morning to three basic ideas: first, the
importance  of  recognizing  and  focusing  on  the  transition  from  the
current  infrastructure  to  a  hydrogen  infrastructure;  second,  the
need  for  long-term,  fundamental  research  to  resolve  five  key  ques-
tions  in  the  hydrogen  economy;  and  third,  the  importance  of  ena-
bling  entrepreneurs  and  innovators  to  take  the  results  of  this  re-
search  and  move  them  into  the  marketplace  and  move  them  into
commercial practice.

Let me take those ideas one at a time.
First, the transition is a competitive transition. I think it is help-
ful  to  think  of  three  competing  infrastructures:  first,  the  internal
combustion  engine,  both  spark  ignition  and  compression  ignition,
and  the  fuel  industries  that  have  built  up  around  that,  which  are
perfectly satisfactory from a consumer point of view, offering mobil-
ity  services  that  are  reasonably  priced  and  widely  available;  the
next  competing  infrastructure  that  is  emerging  into  the  market,
the hybrid electric vehicle that uses that same fuels infrastructure;
and then the third one, the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, the ultimate
competitor that removes oil as the issue in our national life and re-
moves carbon as an environmental issue.

Now  if  you  look  at  the  competitive  battle  amongst  these  three,
there are some lessons that come out of this look for market share.
First,  it  is  a  50-year  struggle.  It  takes  a  long  time  to  change  out
these  infrastructures.  Second,  and  equally  important,  that  means
that  all  three  infrastructures  will  co-exist  during  some  period  dur-
ing  the  transition,  and  that  means  the  hybrid  electric  vehicle  will
also be an important contributor, both because of its fuel efficiency
and  also  because  it  will  pioneer  some  key  electric  management
technologies  later  useful  for  the  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicle.  Policies
that  accelerate  this  transition  will  be  helpful,  will  gain  more  trac-
tion, than those that are not cognizant of the transition.

Now  what  technologies  would  be  useful?  Well,  one  thing  that
would  would  be  a  hydrogen  appliance  for  service  stations.  This  is
one  of  the  recommendations  that  came  out  of  the  National  Acad-
emy of Sciences’ report that—I served on that committee, also, ad-
vanced technology for hydrogen production with electrolysis, this is
for  small-scale  distributed  manufacturing  of  hydrogen,  break-
through  technologies  for  small-scale  performing,  and  integrated
standard  fueling  station.  All  of  these  are  needed  for  a  distributed
hydrogen production economy that will be part of any transition to
hydrogen.

The  second  key  idea  is  that  fundamental  research  is  needed  to
answer  five  big  questions.  And  these  five  questions  are:  one,  can

23

we  store  hydrogen  on  board  vehicles  at  near  atmospheric  pres-
sures?  I  believe  that  if  we  cannot  do  this,  if  we  have  to  rely  on  ei-
ther  cryogenic  liquids  or  high-pressure  gas,  that  this  is—comes
about  as  near  to  be  a  showstopper  for  the  hydrogen  economy  as
anything  that  I  could  think  of.  And  basic  research  in  a  variety  of
areas to accomplish this, I think, is of fundamental importance.

The second major question concerns carbon. Can we capture and
sequester the carbon dioxide from hydrogen manufacturing in a so-
cietally  acceptable  way?  If  the  answer  is  yes,  then  coal  as  a  feed-
stock offers a very large and very cost-effective pathway to the hy-
drogen economy. If the answer is no, then we have to be about very
quickly developing alternatives to coal.

And  that  is  the  third  major  question:  can  we  sharply  reduce  the
cost  of  hydrogen  from  non-coal  resources,  in  particular,  from  nu-
clear,  nuclear  electricity,  both  in  terms  of  high-temperature  elec-
trolysis of steam and in terms of thermochemical cycles that would
chemically produce the hydrogen?

Fourth,  fuel  cells.  We  need  to  have  improved  fuel  cells  in  order
to  gain  the  efficiency  on  board  the  vehicle  that  offsets  the  ineffi-
ciencies from manufacturing hydrogen.

And finally, improved batteries.
Now all of these require broad-based programs, basic research, a

wide-scale search for ideas.

The  third  major  idea  is  enabling  entrepreneurship.  This  is  par-
ticularly  important  when  the  locus  of  innovation  in  the  motor  in-
dustry is shifting from the OEM, that is the big three automakers,
down toward the suppliers, the tier one, the tier two, the tier three
suppliers, and it is becoming a networked pattern of innovation as
opposed to a linear pattern of innovation.

Now  in  many  other  industries,  mature  industries,  from  com-
puters  to  aerospace,  entrepreneurs  have  become  the  agents  of
change  and  the  most  important  agents  of  change.  It  is  important
that  entrepreneurs  be  enabled,  and  programs  such  as  the  SBIR,
STTR, the ATP, the various alphabet soup of technology and entre-
preneur support, are quite important for that.

But  in  addition,  the  kind  of  commitment  that  Congressman  Ing-
lis talked about in terms of long-term stability of government poli-
cies  is  very  important  here,  because  entrepreneurs  seek  oppor-
tunity,  and  they  seek  opportunities  that  will  be  stable  across  the
tenure  of  time  that  it  takes  to  launch  and  mature  a  high-growth,
high-technology kind of company.

States  and  universities  have  a  strong  role  here,  and  we  at
Clemson  University  are  very  pleased  with  our  work  at  the  Inter-
national  Center  for  Automotive  Research,  called  the  ICAR.  We  in-
tend for this institution to be a major player and innovation labora-
tory  in  moving  technology  not  only  from  our  own  laboratories  and
the laboratories in South Carolina, but from any place in the world
into  the  entire  automotive  cluster,  not  only  the  major  manufactur-
ers but the suppliers as well.

That concludes my statement, Madame Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID L. BODDE

Thank  you,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  for  this  opportunity  to  discuss  the  Road  to  the
Hydrogen Economy, a road I believe we must travel if we are to ensure a world well
supplied  with  clean,  affordable  energy  derived  from  secure  sources.  I  will  speak  to
this from the perspective of motor vehicle transportation and address the questions
posed by the Committee within the framework of three basic ideas.

First,  research  policy  should  view  the  hydrogen  transition  as  a  marketplace  com-
petition.  For  the  next  several  decades,  three  rival  infrastructures  will  compete  for
a  share  of  the  world  auto  market:  (a)  the  current  internal  combustion  engine  and
associated fuels infrastructure; (b) the hybrid electric vehicles, now emerging on the
market;  and  (c)  the  hydrogen  fueled  vehicles,  now  in  early  demonstration.  We  can
judge policy alternatives and applied research investments by their ability to accel-
erate the shift in market share among these competing infrastructures.

Second,  and  in  parallel  with  the  marketplace  transition,  fundamental  research
should focus on sustaining the hydrogen economy into the far future. Key issues in-
clude:  (a)  storing  hydrogen  on-board  vehicles  at  near-atmospheric  pressure;  (b)  se-
questering  the  carbon-dioxide  effluent  from  manufacturing  hydrogen  from  coal;  (c)
sharply  reducing  the  cost  of  hydrogen  produced  from  non-coal  resources,  especially
nuclear,  photobiological,  photoelectrochemical,  and  thin-film  solar  processes;  (d)  im-
proving  the  performance  and  cost  of  fuel  cells;  and  (e)  storing  electricity  on-board
vehicles in batteries that provide both high energy performance and high power per-
formance at reasonable cost.

And  third,  the  results  of  this  research  must  be  brought  swiftly  and  effectively  to
the  marketplace.  This  requires  economic  policies  that  encourage  technology-based
innovation,  both  by  independent  entrepreneurs  and  those  operating  from  the  plat-
form  of  established  companies.  Clemson  University,  through  its  International  Cen-
ter  for  Automotive  Research  and  its  Arthur  M.  Spiro  Center  for  Entrepreneurial
Leadership, intends to become a major contributor to this goal.

In what follows, I will set out my reasoning and the evidence that supports these

three basic ideas.
THE HYDROGEN TRANSITION: A MARKETPLACE COMPETITION

Much thinking about the hydrogen economy concerns ‘‘what’’ issues, visionary de-
scriptions of a national fuels infrastructure that would deliver a substantial fraction
of  goods  and  services  with  hydrogen  as  the  energy  carrier.  And  yet,  past  visions  of
energy futures, however desirable they might have seemed at the time, have not de-
livered  sustained  action,  either  from  a  public  or  private  perspective.  The  national
experience with nuclear power, synthetic fuels, and renewable energy demonstrates
this well.

The  difficulty  arises  from  insufficient  attention  to  the  transition  between  the
present  and  the  desired  future—the  balance  between  forces  that  lock  the  energy
economy  in  stasis  and  the  entrepreneurial  forces  that  could  accelerate  it  toward  a
more beneficial condition.

In  effect,  the  present  competes  against  the  future,  and  the  pace  and  direction  of
any  transition  will  be  governed  by  the  outcome.  Viewing  the  transition  to  a  hydro-
gen  economy  through  the  lens  of  a  competitive  transition  can  bring  a  set  of  ‘‘how’’
questions  to  the  national  policy  debate—questions  of  how  policy  can  rebalance  the
competitive forces so that change prevails in the marketplace.
A Model of the Competitive Transition

The  competitive  battle  will  be  fought  over  a  half  century  among  three  competing

infrastructures:1

sion-ignition form, and its attendant motor fuels supply chain;

• The  internal  combustion  engine  (ICE),  either  in  a  spark-ignition  or  compres-
• The  hybrid  electric  vehicle  (HEV),  now  entering  the  market,  which  achieves
superior  efficiency  by  supplementing  an  internal  combustion  engine  with  an
electric drive system and which uses the current supply chain for motor fuels;
and,
• The hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV), which requires radically distinct tech-

nologies for the vehicle, for fuel-production, and for fuel distribution.

1 Another  concept,  the  battery  electric  vehicle  (BEV),  offers  an  all-electric  drive-train  with  all
on-board energy stored in batteries, which would be recharged from stationary sources when the
vehicle is not in operation. I have not included this among the competitors because battery tech-
nology has not advanced rapidly enough for it to compete in highway markets. In contrast, BEV
have proven quite successful in the personal transportation niche.

Figure  1  shows  one  scenario,  based  on  the  most  optimistic  assumptions,  of  how
market share could shift among the contending infrastructures (NRC 2004). Several
aspects of this scenario bear special mention. First, note the extended time required
for  meaningful  change:  these  are  long-lived  assets  built  around  large,  sunk  invest-
ments. They cannot be quickly changed under the best of circumstances. Second, the
road  to  the  hydrogen  economy  runs  smoothest  through  the  hybrid  electric  vehicle.
The  HEV  offers  immediate  gains  in  fuel  economy  and  advances  technologies  that
will  eventually  prove  useful  for  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles,  especially  battery  and
electric  system  management  technologies.  Although  this  scenario  shows  significant
market penetration for the HEV, its success cannot be assured. The HEV might re-
main a niche product, despite its current popularity if consumers conclude that the
value  of  the  fuel  savings  does  not  compensate  for  the  additional  cost  of  the  HEV.
Or,  its  gains  in  efficiency  might  be  directed  toward  vehicle  size  and  acceleration
rather than fuel economy. Either circumstance would make an early hydrogen tran-
sition even more desirable.

Any  transition  to  a  HFCV  fleet,  however,  will  require  overcoming  a  key  market-
place  barrier  that  is  unique  to  hydrogen—widely  available  supplies  of  fuel.  And  to
this we now turn.
The Chicken and the Egg2

Most  analyses  suggest  that  large-scale  production  plants  in  a  mature  hydrogen
economy can manufacture fuel at a cost that competes well with gasoline at current
prices  (NRC  2004).  However,  investors  will  not  build  these  plants  and  their  sup-
porting  distribution  infrastructure  in  the  absence  of  large-scale  demand.  And,  the
demand  for  hydrogen  will  not  be  forthcoming  unless  potential  purchasers  of  hydro-
gen vehicles can be assured widely available sources of fuel. Variants of this ‘‘chick-
en  and  egg’’  problem  have  limited  the  market  penetration  of  other  fuels,  such  as
methanol  and  ethanol  blends  (M85  and  E85)  and  compressed  natural  gas.  This
issue—the  simultaneous  development  of  the  supply  side  and  demand  sides  of  the
market—raises one of the highest barriers to a hydrogen transition.
Distributed Hydrogen Production for the Transition

To  resolve  this  problem,  a  committee  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NRC
2004)  recommended  an  emphasis  on  distributed  production  of  hydrogen.  In  this
model, the hydrogen fuel would be manufactured at dispensing stations conveniently
located  for  consumers.  Once  the  demand  for  hydrogen  fuel  grew  sufficiently,  then

larger  manufacturing  plants  and  logistic  systems  could  be  built  to  achieve  scale
economies.  However,  distributed  production  of  hydrogen  offers  two  salient  chal-
lenges.

The first challenge is cost. Figure 2, below, shows the delivered cost of molecular
hydrogen  for  a  variety  of  production  technologies.  The  ‘‘distributed’’  technologies,  to
the  right  in  Figure  2,  offer  hydrogen  at  a  cost  between  two  and  five  times  the  cost
of  the  large-scale,  ‘‘central  station’’  technologies,  on  the  left  in  Figure  2.  Techno-
logical advances can mitigate, but not remove entirely, this cost disadvantage.

The  second  challenge  concerns  the  environment.  Carbon  capture  and  sequestra-
tion  do  not  appear  practical  in  distributed  production.  During  the  opening  stage  of
a hydrogen transition, we might simply have to accept some carbon releases in order
to achieve the later benefits.
Research to Accelerate a Transition by Distributed Hydrogen Production

A  study  panel  convenienced  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  recently
recommended  several  research  thrusts  that  could  accelerate  distributed  production
for a transition to hydrogen (NRC 2004). These include:

• Development  of  hydrogen  fueling  ‘‘appliance’’  that  can  be  manufactured  eco-
nomically  and  used  in  service  stations  reliably  and  safely  by  relatively  un-
skilled persons—station attendants and consumers.

• Development  of  an  integrated,  standard  fueling  facility  that  includes  the
above appliance as well as generation and storage equipment capable of meet-
ing the sharply varying demands of a 24-hour business cycle.

• Advanced  technologies  for  hydrogen  production  from  electrolysis,  essentially
a fuel cell operated in reverse, to include enabling operation from intermittent
energy sources, such as wind.

• Research  on  breakthrough  technologies  for  small-scale  reformers  to  produce

hydrogen from fossil feedstocks.

The  Department  of  Energy  has  adopted  the  NAS  recommendations  and  modified
its  programs  accordingly.  It  remains  too  early  to  judge  progress,  but  in  any  case
these  technologies  should  receive  continued  emphasis  as  the  desired  transition  to
hydrogen nears. However, progress in research is notoriously difficult to forecast ac-
curately. This suggests consideration be given to interim strategies that would work
on  the  demand  side  of  the  marketplace,  either  to  subsidize  the  cost  of  distributed
hydrogen  production  while  demand  builds  or  to  raise  the  cost  of  the  competition,
gasoline  and  diesel  fuels.  Such  actions  would  relieve  the  research  program  of  the
entire burden for enabling the transition.

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH TO SUSTAIN A HYDROGEN ECONOMY

27

At  the  same  time  that  the  marketplace  transition  advances,  several  high-payoff

(but also high-risk) research campaigns should be waged. These include:
• Storing hydrogen on-board vehicles at near-atmospheric pressure;
• Sequestering  the  carbon-dioxide  effluent  from  manufacturing  hydrogen  from
• Sharply reducing the cost of hydrogen produced from non-coal resources, espe-
cially  nuclear,  photobiological,  photoelectrochemical,  and  thin-film  solar  proc-
esses;

coal;

• Improving the performance and cost of fuel cells; and,
• Storing  electricity  on-board  vehicles  in  batteries  that  provide  both  high  en-

ergy performance and high power performance at reasonable cost.

On-Vehicle Hydrogen Storage

The  most  important  long-term  research  challenge  is  to  provide  a  more  effective
means  of  storing  hydrogen  on  vehicles  than  the  compressed  gas  or  cryogenic  liquid
now  in  use.  In  my  judgment,  failure  to  achieve  this  comes  closer  to  a  complete
‘‘show-stopper’’ than any other possibility. I believe this true for two reasons: hydro-
gen leakage as the vehicle fleet ages, and cost.

With regard to leakage, high pressure systems currently store molecular hydrogen
on  demonstration  vehicles  safely  and  effectively.  But  these  are  new  and  specially-
built,  and  trained  professionals  operate  and  maintain.  What  can  we  expect  of  pro-
duction  run  vehicles  that  receive  the  casual  maintenance  afforded  most  cars?  A
glance at the oil-stained pavement of any parking lot offers evidence of the leakage
of  heavy  fluids  stored  in  the  current  ICE  fleet  at  atmospheric  pressure.  As  high
pressure systems containing the lightest element in the universe age, we might find
even  greater  difficulties  with  containment.  With  regard  to  cost,  the  energy  losses
from  liquefaction  and  even  compression  severely  penalize  the  use  of  hydrogen  fuel,
especially when manufactured at distributed stations.

The  NAS  Committee,  cited  earlier  (NRC  2004),  strongly  supported  an  increased
emphasis  on  game-changing  approaches  to  on-vehicle  hydrogen  storage.  One  alter-
native  could  come  from  novel  approaches  to  generating  the  hydrogen  on  board  the
vehicle.3 Chemical  hydrides,  for  example,  might  offer  some  promise  here,  such  as
the sodium borohydride system demonstrated by DaimlerChrysler.
Carbon Sequestration

Domestic coal resources within the United States hold the potential to relieve the
security  burdens  arising  from  oil  dependence—but  only  if  the  environmental  con-
sequences  of  their  use  can  be  overcome.  Further,  as  shown  in  Figure  2,  coal  offers
the  lowest  cost  pathway  to  a  hydrogen-based  energy  economy,  once  the  transient
conditions have passed. Thus, the conditions under which this resource can be used
should be established as soon as possible. The prevailing assumption holds that the
carbon effluent from hydrogen manufacturing can be stored as a gas (carbon dioxide,
or  CO2)  in  deep  underground  formations.  Yet  how  long  it  must  be  contained  and
what leakage rates can be tolerated remain unresolved issues (Socolow 2005). With-
in  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  carbon  sequestration  program  is  managed  sepa-
rately  from  hydrogen  and  vehicles  programs.  The  NAS  committee  recommended
closer coordination between the two as well as an ongoing emphasis on carbon cap-
ture and sequestration (NRC 2004).
Producing Hydrogen Without Coal

Manufacturing  hydrogen  from  non-fossil  resources  stands  as  an  important  hedge
against  future  constraints  on  production  from  coal,  or  even  from  natural  gas.  And
under any circumstance, the hydrogen economy will be more robust if served by pro-
duction from a variety of domestic sources.

The non-fossil resource most immediately available is nuclear. Hydrogen could be
produced  with  no  CO2 emissions  by  using  nuclear  heat  and  electricity  in  the  high-
temperature electrolysis of steam. Here the technology issues include the durability
of the electrode and electrolyte materials, the effects of high pressure, and the scale-
up of the electrolysis cell. Alternatively, a variety of thermochemical reactions could
produce  hydrogen  with  great  efficiency.  Here  the  needed  research  concerns  higher
operating  temperatures  (700°C  to  1000°C)  for  the  nuclear  heat  as  well  as  research

3 I  do  not  include  on-board  reforming  of  fossil  feedstocks,  like  gasoline,  among  these.  These
systems  offer  little  gain  beyond  that  achievable  with  the  HEV,  and  most  industrial  proponents
appear to have abandoned the idea.

into the chemical cycles themselves. In both cases, the safety issues that might arise
from coupling the nuclear island with a hydrogen production plant bear examination
(NRC 2004).

In  addition,  hydrogen  production  from  renewable  sources  should  be  emphasized,
especially  that  avoiding  the  inefficiencies  of  the  conventional  chain  of  conversions:
(1) from primary energy into electricity; (2) from electricity to hydrogen; (3) from hy-
drogen  to  electricity  on-board  the  vehicle;  (4)  from  electricity  to  mobility,  which  is
what  the  customer  wanted  in  the  first  place.  Novel  approaches  to  using  renewable
energy, such as photobiological or photoelectrochemical, should be supported strong-
ly (NRC 2004).
Improved Fuel Cells

The cost and performance of fuel cells must improve significantly for hydrogen to
achieve its full potential. To be sure, molecular hydrogen can be burned in specially
designed internal combustion engines. But doing so foregoes the efficiency gains ob-
tainable  from  the  fuel  cell,  and  becomes  a  costly  and  (from  an  energy  perspective)
inefficient  process.  The  NAS  Committee  thought  the  fuel  cell  essential  for  a  hydro-
gen  economy  to  be  worth  the  effort  required  to  put  it  in  place.  They  recommended
an  emphasis  on  long-term,  breakthrough  research  that  would  dramatically  improve
cost, durability, cycling capacity, and useful life.
Improved Batteries

The battery is as important to a hydrogen vehicle as to a hybrid because it serves
as  the  central  energy  management  device.  For  example,  the  energy  regained  from
regenerative  braking  must  be  stored  in  a  battery  for  later  reuse.  Though  energy
storage  governs  the  overall  operating  characteristics  of  the  battery,  a  high  rate  of
energy  release  (power)  can  enable  the  electric  motor  to  assist  the  HEV  in  accelera-
tion  and  relieve  the  requirements  for  fuel  cells  to  immediately  match  their  power
output  with  the  needs  of  the  vehicle.  Thus,  advanced  battery  research  becomes  a
key enabler for the hydrogen economy and might also expand the scope of the BEV.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY

For the results of DOE research to gain traction in a competitive economy, entre-
preneurs and corporate innovators must succeed in bringing hydrogen-related inno-
vations  to  the  marketplace.  In  many  cases,  independent  entrepreneurs  provide  the
path-breaking  innovations  that  lead  to  radical  improvements  in  performance,  while
established companies provide continuous, accumulating improvement.4 The Federal
Government,  in  partnership  with  states  and  universities,  can  become  an  important
enabler of both pathways to a hydrogen economy.
Federal Policies Promoting Entrepreneurship

From  the  federal  perspective,  several  policies  could  be  considered  to  build  an  en-

trepreneurial climate on the ‘‘supply’’ side of the market. These include:

• Special  tax  consideration  for  investors  in  new  ventures  offering  products  rel-
evant to fuel savings. The intent would be to increase the amount of venture
capital available to startup companies.

• Commercialization  programs  might  enable  more  entrepreneurs  to  bring  their
nascent  technologies  up  to  investment  grade.  For  example,  an  enhanced  and
focused  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  program  might  increase
the number of participating entrepreneurs participating in fuel-relevant mar-
kets.  A  portion  of  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)  could  be  focused
in like manner.

• Outreach  from  the  National  Laboratories  to  entrepreneurs  might  be  im-
proved.  Some  laboratories,  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory
(NREL) for example, offer small, but effective programs. But more systematic
outreach,  not  to  business  in  general,  but  to  entrepreneurial  business,  would
also increase the supply of market-ready innovations.

On  the  demand  side,  any  policy  that  increases  consumer  incentives  to  purchase
fuel  efficient  vehicles  will  provide  an  incentive  for  ongoing  innovation—provided
that  the  policy  is  perceived  as  permanent.  Entrepreneurs  and  innovators  respond
primarily to opportunity; but that opportunity must be durable for the 10-year cycle
required to establish a new, high-growth company.

States and Universities as Agents of Innovation/Entrepreneurship

Innovation/entrepreneurship  is  a  contact  sport,  and  that  contact  occurs  most  fre-
quently  and  most  intensely  within  the  context  of  specific  laboratories  and  specific
relationships.  I  will  use  Clemson’s  International  Center  for  Automotive  Research
(ICAR)  to  illustrate  this  principle.  Most  fundamentally,  the  ICAR  is  a  partnership
among  the  State  of  South  Carolina,  major  auto  makers,5 and  their  Tier  I,  Tier  II,
and Tier III suppliers. The inclusion of these suppliers will be essential for the suc-
cess of ICAR or any similar research venture. This is because innovation in the auto
industry  has  evolved  toward  a  global,  networked  process,  much  as  it  has  in  other
industries  like  microelectronics.  The  ‘‘supply  chain’’  is  more  accurately  described  as
a network, and network innovation will replace the linear model.

For  these  reasons,  the  ICAR,  when  fully  established,  will  serve  as  a  channel  for
research and innovation to flow into the entire cluster of auto-related companies in
the  Southeast  United  States.  We  anticipate  drawing  together  and  integrating  the
best technology from a variety of sources:

• Research performed at Clemson University and at the ICAR itself;
• Research performed at the Savannah River National Laboratory and the Uni-

versity of South Carolina; and,

• Relevant science and technology anywhere in the world.

Beyond research, the ICAR will include two other components of a complete inno-
vation package: education, and entrepreneur support. With regard to education, the
Master  of  Science  and  Ph.D.  degrees  offered  through  the  ICAR  will  emphasize  the
integration of new technology into vehicle design, viewing the auto and its manufac-
turing plant as an integrated system. In addition, courses on entrepreneurship and
innovation,  offered  through  Clemson’s  Arthur  M.  Spiro  Center  for  Entrepreneurial
Leadership, will equip students with the skills to become effective agents of change
within the specific context of the global motor vehicle industry.

With  regard  to  entrepreneur  support,  the  ICAR  will  host  a  state-sponsored  inno-
vation  center  to  nurture  startup  companies  that  originate  in  the  Southeast  auto
cluster and to draw others from around the world into that cluster. In addition, the
ICAR innovation center will welcome teams from established companies seeking the
commercial development of their technologies. The State of South Carolina has pro-
vided  significant  support  through  four  recent  legislative  initiatives.  The  Research
University  Infrastructure  and  the  Research  Centers  of  Economic  Excellence  Acts
build  the  capabilities  of  the  state’s  universities;  and  the  Venture  Capital  Act  and
Innovation Centers Act provide support for entrepreneurs.

None  of  these  elements  can  suffice  by  itself;  but  taken  together  they  combine  to
offer a package of technology, education, and innovation that can serve the hydrogen
transition extraordinarily well.
A CONCLUDING OBSERVATION

Revolutionary  technological  change  of  the  kind  contemplated  here  is  rarely  pre-
dictable and never containable. Every new technology from the computer to the air-
plane to the automobile carries with it a chain of social and economic consequences
that reach far beyond the technology itself. Some of these consequences turn out to
be  benign;  some  pose  challenges  that  must  be  overcome  by  future  generations;  but
none have proven foreseeable.

For example, a hydrogen transition might bring prolonged prosperity or economic
decline to the electric utility industry depending upon which path innovation takes.
A  pathway  that  leads  through  plug-hybrids  to  home  appliances  that  manufacture
hydrogen by electrolysis would reinforce the current utility business model. A path-
way  in  which  hydrogen  fuel  cell  vehicles  serve  as  generators  for  home  electric  en-
ergy would undermine that model. The same holds true for the coal industry. A fu-
ture in which carbon sequestration succeeds will affect coal far differently from one
in which it cannot be accomplished.

The  only  certainty  is  that  the  energy  economy  will  be  vastly  different  from  that

which we know today. It will have to be.

APPENDIX:6 THE  PROCESS  OF  INNOVATION  AND  IMPLICATIONS  FOR

THE HYDROGEN TRANSITION

At the beginning, it might be helpful to review some general principles regarding
technological innovation and how it advances performance throughout the economy.
We  should  begin  by  understanding  technology  from  the  customer  perspective—not
as a ‘‘thing,’’ but as a service.
Technology Viewed as a Service

Fuels  and  vehicles  have  little  value  in  themselves,  but  enormous  utility  as  pro-
viders  of  mobility  services.  These  valued  services  include  performance  vectors  like:
• Time saving: will the vehicle travel far enough that the driver does not waste

time with frequent refueling?

• Safety:  how  well  does  the  vehicle  protect  its  occupants,  both  by  its  ability  to

avoid accidents and by its ability to survive them?

• Comfort: can the vehicle mitigate the stress and hassles of road travel for the

driver and passengers?

• Image: what does driving this particular vehicle say about its occupants?
• Ancillary  services:  does  the  vehicle  have  enough  generating  capacity  to  meet

the growing demand for on-board, electricity-based services?

At  any  time,  consumers  emphasize  some  of  these  performance  dimensions  while
satisficing  along  others.  Consider  the  consumer  preferences  revealed  by  an  EPA
analysis  of  automobile  performance  from  1981  to  2003.  Over  this  period,  average
horsepower  nearly  doubled  (from  102  to  197  horsepower),  weight  increased  mark-
edly  (from  3,201  to  3,974  lbs),  and  the  time  required  to  accelerate  from  zero  to  60
mph dropped by nearly 30 percent. An energy policy that added fuel security to the
competitive  performance  dimensions  for  road  transportation  would  do  much  to  pro-
mote the hydrogen transition.
Technology-based Innovation: Accumulating

Technological innovations can be grouped into two general classes: those that ad-
vance performance by accumulating incremental improvements, and those that offer
discontinuous  leaps  in  performance.  The  term  accumulating  applies  to  technologies
that advance performance along dimensions already recognized and accepted by cus-
tomers.  Each  improvement  might  be  incremental,  but  the  cumulative  effect  com-
pounds  to  yield  markedly  improved  performance—consider  the  improvements  in
processor  speed  for  computers,  for  example.  Auto  manufacturers  are  accustomed  to
competing  along  these  dimensions,  and  the  cumulative  effect  can  lead  to  important
advances—but  only  if  the  technology  competition  continues  long  enough  for  the
gains  to  accumulate.  Most  of  the  fuel  saving  technologies  discussed  at  this  hearing
are  incremental  in  nature,  and  so  nurturing  this  kind  of  innovation  could  become
an important policy goal.
Technology-based Innovation: Discontinuous

In  contrast,  discontinuous  technologies  introduce  performance  dimensions  quite
distinct from what the mainstream customers have come to value, sometimes offer-
ing inferior performance along the accustomed dimensions. Because of their inferior
mainstream  performance,  these  technologies  initially  gain  traction  only  in  niche
markets. With continued use and improvement, however, discontinuous technologies
gain  adequacy  along  the  original  dimensions  and  then  enter  the  mainstream  mar-
kets.

Consider the battery electric vehicle (BEV), for example. Many analysts have writ-
ten  off  electric  vehicles  because  of  their  inferior  performance  in  mainstream  auto
markets—acceleration,  range,  and  recharge  time.  Yet  electric  vehicle  technologies
are  emerging  in  an  important  niche:  the  market  for  personal  transportation.  This
includes  golf  carts,  all-terrain  vehicles,  touring  vehicles  for  resorts,  transportation
within  gated  communities,  and  so  forth.  In  that  market,  the  chief  performance  di-
mensions  are  convenient  access,  economy,  and  ease  of  use—and  style.  The  current
state of electric vehicle technology is adequate for the limited range and acceleration
requirements  of  this  niche.  But,  could  electric  vehicle  technology  advance  to  the
point of entry into mainstream markets? Or, could it compete effectively in personal
transportation markets in developing countries—say Thailand or China? That is, of
course, unknowable. But, please recall that the personal computer was once consid-

ered a hobbyists toy, inherently without enough power to enter mainstream applica-
tions.

Discontinuous  innovation  tends  to  be  the  province  of  the  entrepreneur,  and  the
companies  that  such  persons  found  become  platforms  for  the  innovations  that  radi-
cally change all markets. Yet entrepreneurs often have low visibility relative to the
market  incumbents  in  policy  discussions,  and  their  companies  are  far  from  house-
hold  words.7 This  is  because  the  entrepreneurs’  story  is  about  the  future,  not  the
present;  about  what  could  be  and  not  about  what  is.  For  that  reason,  policies  that
encourage  entrepreneurship  in  technologies  relevant  to  the  hydrogen  transition
should become part of the energy policy conversation.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MARK  CHERNOBY,  VICE  PRESIDENT,  AD-
VANCED  VEHICLE  ENGINEERING,  DAIMLERCHRYSLER  COR-
PORATION
Mr.  CHERNOBY.  We  are  going  to  shift  a  little  bit  and  use  some
visual  aids  to  support  my  conversation,  so  go  ahead  to  the  next
slide, please.

[Slide.]
I want to thank the Chairs and the distinguished Members of the
House  Committee  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.
I  am  going  to  briefly  describe  DaimlerChrysler’s  involvement  in
the  Administration’s  hydrogen  initiative,  what  we  are  trying  to  do
to advance the overall hydrogen economy, and then as well as some
of the specific questions raised today.

Mr.  Chairman,  you  mentioned  three  keys.  You  mentioned  com-
mitment,  collaboration,  and  discovery.  And  as  I  go  through  these
slides, I am going to try and point that out.

In the slide you see before you now, what I am trying to describe
is  DaimlerChrysler,  we  have  been  working  on  fuel  cell  technology
for  over  10  years.  We  have  poured  a  billion  dollars  into  different
technologies for fuel cells that run on different fuel sources. We are
committed. We have now centered, in the past few years, all of our
work on hydrogen as the base fuel for these fuel cell products. And
as  you  can  see  on  the  slide  with  the  various  pictures,  we  are  at-
tempting  to  look  at  products  that  could  be  attractive  to  a  broad
range  of  the—of  customers,  be  it  heavy  buses  for  certain  types  of
environments  all  of  the  way  down  to  the  small  and  compact  car.

Next slide, please.

[Slide.]
One  of  the  critical  enablers  is  collaboration.  We  participate  as  a
member  for  the  United  States  Council  for  Automotive  Research
with  our  partners  at  Ford  and  General  Motors.  And  then  most  re-
cently,  we  think  it  is  exceptional  to  have  added  partners  from  BP,
ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, Exxon, and Shell, because we truly
think  the  march  to  a  completely  new  technology,  a  different  way
of  life  in  the  hydrogen  economy  is  going  to  truly  require  collabora-
tion  in  a  pre-competitive  environment  across  these  multiple  indus-
tries.  We  have  got  to  bring  together  both  vehicle  and  the  infra-
structure. And as you see in the center of this slide, the joint part-
nership and how we work together in certain task teams to under-
stand  how  these  infrastructures  interface  with  the  vehicle,  what
about  the  fuel,  fuel  quality,  how  does  that  relate  to  the  fuel  cell,
it has all got to come together in order to realize a successful tran-
sition to the hydrogen economy.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
At  DaimlerChrysler,  as  Mr.  Honda  mentioned,  we  are  proud  to
be a participant in the Department of Energy’s demonstration pro-
gram.  We  have  numerous  vehicles  that  are  on  the  road  in  the
United  States  already  providing  information  to  the  Department  of
Energy. We have also shared information off of these vehicles with
the Environmental Protection Agency. And really, there are several
key  things  we  are  trying  to  get  out  of  the  demonstration  product.
We  are  moving  from  the  lab  to  the  road.  That  is  critical.  We  have
already  found  failure  modes  and  systems  to  components  that  we
had not seen in the lab environment. And as was mentioned, these
now become initiatives and challenges for us to work on both in the
research and the development environment as we move forward. So
it is critical, when you are moving from a technology, like the inter-
nal combustion engine that we have on the road for well more than
50  years,  we  understand  how  that  affects  the  environment.  With
the  new  technology,  we  have  to  develop  that  understanding.  That
is  why  we  are  participating  in  three  different  environments.  And
DaimlerChrysler, outside of this demonstration project, we have ve-
hicles  around  the  world  in  a  multitude  of  environments.  And  as
you can see, our demonstration vehicles range from the small vehi-
cle,  the  F-cell,  up  to  the  large  sprinter,  because  these  two  types  of
vehicles clearly operate in different environments between the com-
mercial and more of the daily use. So we absolutely think the dem-
onstration  fleet  is  providing  very  valuable  data  to  feed  the  codes
and  standards  efforts  as  well  as  helping  us  find  new  barriers  and
challenges  we  need  to  overcome  to  bring  this  product  to  a  reality.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
There  was  a  question  raised  about,  you  know,  what  does
DaimlerChrysler  do.  What  do  we  focus  on  in  order  to  make  deci-
sions  on  where  we  put  our  research  funds  and  how  much  research
funds get placed against a certain topic?

As you can see on the slide, we basically look at five key factors.
I  would  like  to  tell  you  there  is  a  perfect  math  formula  that  with
algebra you can just plug in the numbers and say this is where you
put  your  money.  Unfortunately,  the  world  and  life  isn’t  that  easy.

We  do  look  at  probability  of  technical  success,  the  probability  of
commercial  success  in  the  market,  the  value  from  a  customer  per-
spective, how does it fit with our business strategy, and then what
strategic leverage does it provide the company. All of these factors,
any type of research that we do, are calibrated, assessed, and then
with  that  assessment,  we  look  at,  all  right,  how  are  we  going  to
prioritize our funding and our people resource over a said time pe-
riod.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
There  was  a  question  raised  about  how  do  we  see  the  fuel  cell
vehicle,  the  infrastructure  coming  together  in  terms  of  time  in
transitioning  to  truly  the  hydrogen-based  economy  for  this  trans-
portation sector.

At  DaimlerChrysler,  we  think  we  are—we  project  we  are  going
to  go  through  four  different  phases.  Right  now,  we  have  moved
from  basically  what  we  call  market  preparation.  That  is  basically
setting up the infrastructure, setting up the vehicles in the lab en-
vironment,  and  getting  ready  to  put  some  vehicles  actually  on  the
road  that  are  fit  for  daily  use.  Fit  for  daily  use,  I  have  to  qualify,
only  in  certain  environments.  As  an  example,  we  have  had  severe
challenges  with  cold  start,  so  you  will  find  many  of  the  vehicles
around  the  world  aren’t  necessarily  in  extremely  cold  environ-
ments.

We think we are going to go through two more stages before this
finally  becomes  the  reality.  We  are  going  to  head  to  a  ramp-up
stage.  That  is  where  we  think  some  of  the  technological  barriers
that are facing us through all of this great pre-competitive research
are going to be overcome. And we will be able to put a larger fleet
in  the  field.  This  larger  fleet  is  going  to  be  limited  by  the  growth
of  the  infrastructure.  We  have  got  to  have  both  the  infrastructure
there,  the  fueling,  along  with  the  vehicle  to  make  it  work.  So  we
project that will be the next stage.

And then the final stage will actually be commercialization. This
is where the—all of the major technical barriers, including cost and
value  to  the  customer,  and  then  broad-based  movement  of  the  in-
frastructure  have  to  come  together  to  make  it  viable  to  move  to
large-scale  production  and  then  large-scale  purchase  and  use  by
the customer base.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
At DaimlerChrysler, though, we are absolutely convinced, both in
the  short-term,  the  near-term,  and  potentially  in  the  long-term,
there  is  going  to  be  a  wide  range  of  technologies  that  are  going  to
be attractive to the marketplace. We are working on all of them at
once, because we believe there is a place for each one of these tech-
nologies  in  the  market  where  they  provide  maximum  value  to  the
customer. As an example, a hybrid provides maximum value to the
customer  who  operates  in  a  city  environment.  The  customer  who
drives  mostly  on  the  highway  may  be  more  attracted  to  a  diesel.
And  so  as  we  transition  between  now  and  the  hydrogen  economy,
we  are  going  to  keep  working  on  trying  to  provide  a  broad-based
set of propulsion technologies for the market to enable them to im-
plement them to benefit not only the environment, but energy secu-

rity,  because  penetration  is  what  is  going  to  matter.  We  don’t  get
a  benefit  from  either  one  of  those  unless  we  get  market  penetra-
tion,  and  so  we  have  got  to  provide  maximum  value  to  the  cus-
tomer.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
There  are  several  key  technology  challenges  in  front  of  us  to
transition  to  the  hydrogen  economy.  We  have—we  would  summa-
rize  them  into  the  fuel  cell  system  itself,  durability,  cost.  We  have
done some great work in terms of the pre-competitive environment,
between academia, government, and industry in overcoming a chal-
lenge such as cold start. So that is one behind us, but we have got
many  more  to  go.  The  battery  system,  as  was  commented  earlier,
is  a  significant  challenge  as  well.  And  then  finally,  hydrogen  stor-
age,  as  Dr.  Bodde  mentioned,  is  a  very  significant  challenge  that
we  absolutely  must  find  a  way  to  overcome  if  we  expect  to  have
broad-based  penetration  of  the  market  and  not  take  space  away
from the customer.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
So  if  we  look  at  the—how  we  think  we  are  going  to  transition,
obviously,  we  are  very  focused  at  DaimlerChrysler  on  the  near-
term  in  providing  both  the  advanced  powertrains  and  hybrid  tech-
nology. And then we, obviously, are very committed to a transition
to an H2 fuel cell vehicle and then the ultimate infrastructure and
economy that is going to come together with the broad-based focus
on  zero  emissions,  ultimate  low  energy  consumption  for  the  envi-
ronment, and then finally the concept of energy self-sufficiency and
energy security that comes along with it.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
I think that is it.
Thank  you,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you

may have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Chernoby follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK CHERNOBY

I  want  to  thank  the  Chairs  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  House  Committee

on Science for this opportunity to appear today.

I am coming before you today to describe our involvement in the Administration’s
Hydrogen Initiatives, and what DaimlerChrysler is doing to advance the overall hy-
drogen  economy,  as  well  as,  address  the  questions  presented  to  me  by  the  Sub-
committee on Research and the Subcommittee on Energy.
What is DaimlerChrysler doing to advance a hydrogen economy?

DaimlerChrysler  has  been  working  on  fuel  cell  technology  for  transportation  uti-
lizing  hydrogen  for  over  ten  years.  We  have  invested  over  $1  Billion  in  R&D  and
have  developed  five  generations  of  vehicles  (NECAR1,  2,  3,  and  4,  and  the  F–Cell).
Of  all  manufacturers,  we  have  the  largest  world  wide  fleet  of  fuel  cell  cars  and
buses (100 vehicles) participating in several international demonstration projects in
the United States, Europe, and Asia. (See Figure 1: DaimlerChrysler Fuel Cell His-
tory)
How  does  DaimlerChrysler  participate  in  the  Administration’s  Hydrogen
Initiatives?

As  a  member  of  the  United  States  Council  for  Automotive  Research  (USCAR),
DaimlerChrysler  is  a  partner  in  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  FreedomCAR
and Fuel Partnership along with General Motors and Ford Motor Company, and BP

America, ChevronTexaco Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corporation, and
Shell  Hydrogen.  The  recent  addition  of  these  five  major  energy  providers  has
strengthened the Partnership considerably, by providing expertise to solve the infra-
structure  challenges.  DaimlerChrysler  has  also  been  working  with  the  DOE  since
1993  on  advanced  automotive  technology  research.  We  support  the  initiative  as
members  on  technical  teams  related  to  advanced  automotive  technology,  including:

— Energy Storage
— Light Weight Materials
— Advanced Combustion
— Hydrogen Storage
— Fuel Cell
— Codes & Standards
— Electrical and Electronics
— Vehicle Systems Analysis

Through  these  tech  teams,  we  help  develop  priorities  based  on  future  needs  and
manage a portfolio of research projects directed at a set of Research Goals and Ob-
jectives. (See Figure 2: FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership)

We  also  are  one  of  four  recipients  to  participate  in  the  DOE  Hydrogen  and  Fleet
Demonstration Project. By the end of 2005, we will have 30 vehicles located in three
ecosystems  (Southern  California,  Northern  California,  and  Southeastern  Michigan)
and were the first OEM to provide valuable technical data to the DOE. (See Figure
3: DOE Hydrogen Fleet & Infrastructure Demonstration & Validation Project)
What  criteria  does  DaimlerChrysler  consider  when  making  investment  de-
cisions  regarding  its  portfolio  of  advanced  vehicle  research  and  develop-
ment programs?

DaimlerChrysler uses five factors of measurement to determine investment prior-

ities in our advance technology portfolio. They are:

— Probability of Technical Success
— Probability of Commercial Success
— Value
— Business Strategy Fit, and
— Strategic Leverage

(See Figure 4: Five Key Investment Factors)

What factors would induce DaimlerChrysler to invest more in the develop-
ment of hydrogen-fueled vehicles?

Several factors could contribute to inducing DaimlerChrysler to invest more in the

development of hydrogen fueled vehicles. Key factors include:

— Significant technological advances in fuel cells and hydrogen storage/produc-

tion

— Major governmental policy support such as incentives, regulatory shifts,
— Changes in consumer demand and competitive pressure
— Significant long-term increases in gasoline prices

What do you see as a probable timeline for the commercialization of hydro-
gen-fueled vehicles?

The  current  technology  is  being  evaluated  in  several  fleet  demonstration  projects
around  the  world.  The  largest  is  the  DOE’s  program  in  the  United  States.  These
programs  include  a  few  hundred  vehicles  worldwide  and  several  hydrogen  fueling
stations.

DaimlerChrysler projects that the hydrogen fueled vehicle technologies will evolve

in discreet phases driven be the following cadence of events:

— Breakthrough in basic research
— Bench/laboratory development
— ‘‘On road’’ testing and development
— Parallel manufacturing process development

Within the next 4–6 years, we will enter another phase utilizing technologies that
address  some  of  the  current  deficiencies  including  durability,  range,  and  cold  start,

fuel. 

as  well  as,  lower  cost.  This  phase  will  see  vehicle  numbers  in  the  low  thousands
and the beginning of a local infrastructure to support them.

The third phase will require significant vehicle technical breakthroughs in hydro-
gen storage, fuel cell cost, and a significantly expanded infrastructure. Technological
breakthroughs are required in hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology (focused on
cost  &  durability).  DaimlerChrysler  shares  a  commitment  with  our  partners  in
USCAR effort to achieve these gains. It is a challenge to predict a definitive timeline
for  technological  discovery.  The  vehicle  fleet  could  grow  to  tens  of  thousands  if  sig-
nificant shifts occur in the infrastructure and value to the consumer. The infrastruc-
ture  must  expand  to  a  much  larger  scale  beyond  local  support.  This  will  be  critical
to  support  the  freedom  to  travel  that  consumers  will  demand  when  we  move  from
a market dominated by local ‘‘fleet’’ customers to the average consumer.

High volume commercialization will require a highly distributed infrastructure ca-
pable of delivering cost competitive hydrogen and fuel cell powered vehicles that can
compete with other fuel efficient technologies. It is likely that this will require con-
tinued  government  policy  support 
(See  Figure  5:
DaimlerChrysler Fuel Cell Strategy)
What  about  the  other  advanced  vehicle  technologies  DaimlerChrysler  is
currently developing, such as hybrid vehicles and advanced diesel engines?
DaimlerChrysler is engaged in a broad range of advanced propulsion technologies.
Fuel  cell  vehicles  are  a  long-term  focus  of  this  technology  portfolio,  which  also  in-
cludes  efficient  gasoline  engines,  advanced  diesels,  and  hybrid  powertrain  systems.
(See Figure 6: DaimlerChrysler’s Advanced Propulsion Technologies)

for  vehicle  and 

DaimlerChrysler is focused on providing the market with the ability to select the
advanced  propulsion  technology  that  best  fits  the  needs  of  the  individual  customer.
Each of the short-term technologies optimizes its benefit to the consumer in specific
drive cycles (hybrid/city, diesel/highway) and hence its value to the customer.

DaimlerChrysler  has  developed  and  implemented  technologies  that  improve  the
efficiency  of  the  current  gasoline  propulsion  system.  We  must  continue  to  enhance
the  gasoline  combustion  propulsion  system  since  it  will  be  the  dominant  choice  in
the market for many years to come. We offer the Multi-Displacement System (MDS)
available in the HEMI in seven Chrysler Group vehicles. MDS seamlessly alternates
between  smooth,  high  fuel  economy  four-cylinder  mode  when  less  power  is  needed
and  V–8  mode  when  more  power  from  the  5.7L  HEMI  engine  is  in  demand.  The
system yields up to 20 percent improved fuel economy.

We  are  also  working  on  further  development  of  gasoline  direct-injection  which

considerably enhances fuel economy by closely monitoring fuel atomization.

DaimlerChrysler offers four different diesel powertrains in the United States, not
including  heavy  trucks.  Advanced  diesel  technology  offers  up  to  30  percent  better
fuel economy and 20 percent less CO2 emissions when compared to equivalent gaso-
line  engines.  The  diesel  provides  maximum  benefit  in  highway  driving  which  for
many customers is a daily occurrence. Advanced diesel is a technology that is avail-
able today and can help reduce our nation’s dependency on foreign oil.

Designing  more  engines  to  run  on  Biodiesel 

is  a  current  objective  at
DaimlerChrysler.  Biodiesel  fuel  reduces  emissions  of  diesel  vehicles,  including  car-
bon  dioxide,  and  lowers  petroleum  consumption.  Each  Jeep  Liberty  Common  Rail
Diesel (CRD) built by DaimlerChrysler is delivered to customers running on B5 bio-
diesel fuel. Nationwide use of B2 fuel (two percent biodiesel) would replace 742 mil-
lion gallons of gasoline per year, according to the National Biodiesel Board.

DaimlerChrysler  and  GM  have  recently  combined  efforts  to  develop  a  two-mode
hybrid drive system that surpasses the efficiency of today’s hybrids. The partnership
will  cut  development  and  system  costs  while  giving  customers  an  affordable  hybrid
alternative that improves fuel economy. The first use of the system will be in early
2008 with the Dodge Durango.
What  do  you  see  as  the  potential  technology  showstoppers  for  a  hydrogen
economy?

The most significant technology showstoppers that DaimlerChrysler recognizes as
challenging  the  viability  of  the  hydrogen  economy  include  fuel  cell  durability,  on-
board hydrogen storage and advanced battery durability performance. Though there
are  major  efforts  and  investment  being  put  into  fuel  cell  development,  the  current
systems  have  to  make  significant  gains  in  life  expectancy  and  extreme  operating
conditions that the average consumer will demand.

No  current  on-board  hydrogen  storage  system  meets  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel
Partnership  targets  for  cost  and  performance.  To  meet  customer  expectations  for
driving range, a large amount of hydrogen is required to be stored on-board. Today’s
compressed  hydrogen  storage  technology  has  limits  in  storage  density  which  leads

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:02 Jan 27, 2006 Jkt 022549 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ENER05\072005\22549.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

39

to  a  compromise  in  passenger  compartment  space  in  order  to  provide  the  driving
range  that  consumer’s  enjoy  today.  Additionally,  the  current  level  of  technology  for
high-pressure  storage  tanks  that  are  available  has  associated  manufacturing  proc-
esses that take multiple days per tank. The on-board hydrogen storage tank indus-
try currently does not have the capacity to support even low-volume production lev-
els.  Alternative  and  novel  methods  of  storing  hydrogen  on-board  are  critical  to  the
hydrogen economy.

While  several  advancements  have  been  made  in  battery  technology  in  recent
years, the current level of technology does not support performance requirements for
power, energy and durability. (See Figure 7: Technology Showstoppers)

In  addition  to  the  technology  challenges  identified  above,  the  cost  challenges  are
significant  barriers.  To  realize  large  scale  market  penetration,  we  will  have  to  ap-
proach the value that customers enjoy with current propulsion technologies.

Even with a viable vehicle, the hydrogen economy will not become a reality with-
out  a  highly  distributed  infrastructure.  Our  Energy  Partners  in  the  FreedomCAR
and Fuel effort are committed to the research and technology development required
to realize this goal. Industry and government will need to work together to develop
an implementation plan with financial viability for all entities.
To  what  extent  is  DaimlerChrysler  relying  on  government  programs  to
help solve those technical challenges?

DaimlerChrysler realizes that the technical challenges associated with moving to-
wards  the  hydrogen  economy  are  too  great  and  too  costly  for  any  one  company  to
solve. Therefore, we see a benefit in multiple companies working together with gov-
ernment  in  pre-competitive  technology  development.  Due  to  the  enormity  of  this
transition,  DaimlerChrysler  actively  participates  in  USCAR  with  Ford  Motor  Com-
pany and General Motors and in the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership along with
the other USCAR members as well as the U.S. Department of Energy, BP America,
ChevronTexaco Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corporation and Shell Hy-
drogen.  The  research  required  to  solve  the  technical  challenges  of  the  hydrogen
economy  is  universally  viewed  as  ‘‘high  risk’’  by  industry.  The  research  sponsored
by  DOE  through  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  provides  a  forum  to  pull
together  some  of  the  best  minds  and  organizations  involved  in  advancement  of  the
hydrogen economy to help address that risk. The development of the hydrogen infra-
structure  must  progress  in  parallel  with  fuel  cell  vehicle  technologies.  (See  Figure
8: Technology Relationship Strategy)
How are automakers using, or how do they plan to use, the advanced vehi-
cle  technology  developed  for  hydrogen-fueled  vehicles  to  improve  the  per-
formance of conventional vehicles?

As stated earlier, DaimlerChrysler is working on a broad portfolio of technologies
to  improve  the  efficiency  and  environmental  impact  of  transportation.  In  the  short-
term we continue to improve the internal combustion engine (ICE). In the mid-term
we  are  developing  hybrid  vehicles  utilizing  electric  drive  systems,  integrated  power
modules  and  advanced  batteries.  In  the  long-term  fuel  cell  vehicles  with  on-board
hydrogen storage from a national hydrogen infrastructure will emerge.

The  current  portfolio  of  R&D  within  the  DOE’s  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Initiative
is focused on the long-term hydrogen vision, but many of the technologies are useful
and will mature in the shorter-term as transition technologies. Cost effective, light-
weight  materials  can  be  applied  to  vehicles  in  the  short-term  to  improve  fuel  effi-
ciency regardless of the propulsion technology. Advanced energy storage and motors
will benefit both hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. Novel approaches to hydrogen storage
are  uniquely  required  by  hydrogen  fueled  vehicles,  but  can  support  stationary  and
portable applications in the industrial and consumer markets.

It  is  important  to  advance  and  mature  many  of  the  aspects  of  the  technology  as
early  as  possible.  There  are  many  challenges  and  breakthroughs  needed  to  realize
the President’s vision of a ‘‘Hydrogen Economy.’’

STATEMENT OF DR. GEORGE W. CRABTREE, DIRECTOR, MATE-
RIALS  SCIENCE  DIVISION,  ARGONNE  NATIONAL  LABORA-
TORY
Dr. CRABTREE. Is it working?
Yes. Good. Thanks.
Chairman Biggert, Chairman Inglis, Members of the Energy and
Research  Subcommittees,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify
today and share my thoughts on the hydrogen economy.

I will address the role of basic research in bringing the hydrogen
economy  to  fruition.  As  background  for  my  testimony,  I  would  like
to  introduce  into  the  record  the  report  ‘‘Basic  Research  Needs  for
the  Hydrogen  Economy’’  based  on  the  workshop  held  by  the  De-
partment  of  Energy  Office  of  Basic  Energy  Sciences.  This  report
documents the vision of hydrogen as the fuel of the future and the
scientific challenges that must be met to realize a vibrant and com-
petitive  hydrogen  economy.  (This  information  appears  in  Appendix
2: Additional Material for the Record.)

The  enormous  appeal  of  hydrogen  as  a  fuel  is  matched  by  an
equally  enormous  set  of  critical  scientific  and  engineering  chal-
lenges. Currently, nearly all of the hydrogen we use is produced by
reforming natural gas. In a mature hydrogen economy, this produc-
tion  route  simply  exchanges  a  dependence  on  foreign  oil  for  a  de-
pendence  on  foreign  gas,  and  it  does  not  reduce  the  production  of
environmental  pollutants  or  greenhouse  gases.  We  must  find  car-
bon-neutral  production  routes  for  hydrogen  with  the  capacity  to
displace a large percentage of our fossil fuel use.

The  most  appealing  route  is  splitting  water  renewably,  because
the  supply  of  water  is  effectively  inexhaustible,  free  of  geopolitical
constraints, and splitting it produces no greenhouse gases or pollut-
ants.  Although  some  routes  for  splitting  water  renewably  are
known, we do not know how to make them cost-effective, nor do we
understand  how  to  adapt  them  to  a  diversity  of  renewable  energy
sources.  The  onboard  storage  of  hydrogen  for  transportation  is  the
second  critical  basic  science  challenge.  To  allow  a  300-mile  driving
range  without  compromising  cargo  and  passenger  space,  we  must
store hydrogen at high density and with fast release times.

Since  the  1970s,  over  2,000  hydrogen  compounds  have  been  ex-
amined  for  their  storage  capability.  None  have  been  found  that
meet the storage demands. This critical storage challenge cannot be
met without significant basic research. We must better understand
the  interaction  of  hydrogen  with  materials  and  exploit  this  knowl-
edge to design effective storage media.

The  critical  challenges  for  fuel  cells  are  cost,  performance,  and
reliability.  High  cost  arises  from  expensive  catalysts  and  mem-
brane  materials.  Performance  is  limited  by  the  low  chemical  activ-
ity of catalysts and the ionic conductivity of membranes.

Although catalysts have been known for centuries, we still do not
understand  why  or  how  they  work.  Our  approach  to  catalysis  is
largely  empirical.  We  often  find  that  the  best  catalysts  are  the
most  expensive  metals,  like  platinum.  The  challenge  is  to  under-
stand  catalysis  on  the  molecular  level  and  use  that  understanding
to  design  low-cost,  high-performance  catalysts  targeted  for  fuel
cells.

Membranes  are  another  critical  basic  research  challenge  for  fuel
cells.  Currently,  fuel  cells  for  transportation  depend  almost  exclu-
sively  on  one  membrane:  a  carbon-fluorine  polymer  with  sulfonic
side chains. Our ability to design alternative membranes is limited
by our poor understanding of their ion conduction mechanisms. Sig-
nificant  basic  materials  research  is  needed  before  practical  new
membrane materials can be found and developed.

These  three  challenges  are  critical  for  the  long-term  success  of
the  hydrogen  economy:  production  of  hydrogen  by  splitting  water
renewably,  storage  of  hydrogen  at  high  density  with  fast  release
times, and improved catalysts and membranes for fuel cells.

For  each  of  these  challenges,  incremental  improvements  in  the
present  state-of-the-art  will  not  produce  a  hydrogen  economy  that
is  competitive  with  fossil  fuels.  Revolutionary  breakthroughs  are
needed of the kind that come only from high-risk, high-payoff basic
research.

The  outlook  for  achieving  such  breakthroughs  is  promising.  The
recent  worldwide  emphasis  on  nanoscience  and  nanotechnology
opens up many new directions for hydrogen materials research. All
of  the  critical  challenges  outlined  above  depend  on  understanding
and  manipulating  hydrogen  at  the  nanoscale.  Nanoscience  has
given  us  new  fabrication  tools  capable  of  creating  molecular  archi-
tectures of unprecedented complexity and functionality.

The  explosion  of  experimental  techniques  to  probe  matter  at
ever-smaller  link  scales  and  time  scales  brings  new  knowledge
within our reach. Numerical simulations running on computer clus-
ters  of  hundreds  of  nodes  can  model  the  atomic  processes  of  water
splitting,  hydrogen  storage  and  release,  catalysis,  and  ion  motion
in  membranes.  These  recent  scientific  developments  set  the  stage
for  breakthroughs  in  hydrogen  materials  science  needed  for  a  ma-
ture, sustainable, and competitive hydrogen economy.

Thank you.

hydrogen  economy  to  fruition.  As  background  for  my  testimony,  I  would  like  to  in-
troduce into the record the report on ‘‘Basic Research Needs for the Hydrogen Econ-
omy’’  based  on  the  Workshop  held  by  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  Office  of
Basic  Energy  Sciences.  This  report  documents  the  vision  of  hydrogen  as  the  fuel  of
the  future,  and  the  scientific  challenges  that  must  be  met  to  realize  a  vibrant  and
competitive hydrogen economy.

Let  me  start  my  testimony  by  recalling  the  energy  challenges  that  motivate  the
transition to a hydrogen economy. Our dependence on fossil fuel requires that much
of  our  energy  come  from  foreign  sources;  securing  our  energy  supply  for  the  future
demands that we develop domestic energy sources. Continued use of fossil fuels pro-
duces local and regional pollution that threatens the quality of our environment and
the health of our citizens. Finally, fossil fuels produce greenhouse gases like carbon
dioxide that threaten our climate with global warming.

Hydrogen  as  a  fuel  addresses  all  of  these  issues:  it  is  found  abundantly  in  com-
pounds like water that are widely accessible without geopolitical constraints, it pro-
duces  no  pollutants  or  greenhouse  gases  as  byproducts  of  its  use,  and  it  converts
readily  to  heat  through  combustion  and  to  electricity  through  fuel  cells  that  couple
seamlessly to our existing energy networks.
Critical Challenges: Production

The  enormous  appeal  of  hydrogen  as  a  fuel  is  matched  by  an  equally  enormous
set  of  critical  scientific  and  engineering  challenges.  Unlike  fossil  fuels,  hydrogen
does  not  occur  naturally  in  the  environment.  Instead,  hydrogen  must  be  produced
from  natural  resources  like  fossil  fuels,  biomass  or  water.  Currently  nearly  all  the
hydrogen  we  use  is  produced  by  reforming  natural  gas.  To  power  cars  and  light
trucks  in  the  coming  decades  we  will  need  10  to  15  times  the  amount  of  hydrogen
we  now  produce.  This  hydrogen  cannot  continue  to  come  from  natural  gas,  as  that
production route simply exchanges a dependence on foreign oil for a dependence on
foreign  gas,  and  it  does  not  reduce  the  production  of  environmental  pollutants  or
greenhouse gases. We must find carbon-neutral production routes for hydrogen. The
most  appealing  route  is  splitting  water  renewably,  because  the  supply  of  water  is
effectively inexhaustible and splitting it produces no greenhouse gases or pollutants.
Although some routes for splitting water renewably are known, we do not know how
to  make  them  cost-effective,  nor  do  we  know  how  to  adapt  them  to  a  diversity  of
renewable energy sources. Splitting water renewably is a critical basic science chal-
lenge  that  must  be  addressed  if  the  hydrogen  economy  is  to  achieve  its  long-term
goals  of  replacing  fossil  fuels,  reducing  our  dependence  on  foreign  energy  sources,
and eliminating the emission of pollution and greenhouse gases.
Critical Challenges: Storage

The  on-board  storage  of  hydrogen  for  transportation  is  a  second  critical  basic
science  challenge.  To  allow  a  300-mile  driving  range  without  compromising  cargo
and passenger space, we must store hydrogen at densities higher than that of liquid
hydrogen. This may seem a daunting task, but in fact there are a host of materials
where hydrogen combines with other elements at densities 50 percent to 100 percent
higher  than  that  of  liquid  hydrogen.  Since  the  1970s  over  two  thousand  hydrogen
compounds  have  been  examined  for  their  storage  capability;  none  has  been  found
that  meet  the  storage  demands.  The  challenge  is  to  satisfy  two  conflicting  require-
ments:  high  storage  capacity  and  fast  release  times.  High  hydrogen  capacity  re-
quires close packing and strong chemical bonding of hydrogen, while fast release re-
quires  loose  packing  and  weak  bonding  for  high  hydrogen  mobility.  This  critical
storage  challenge  cannot  be  met  without  significant  basic  research:  we  must  better
understand  the  interaction  of  hydrogen  with  materials  and  exploit  this  knowledge
to design effective storage media.
Critical Challenges: Fuel Cells

The use of hydrogen in fuel cells presents a third critical scientific challenge. Fuel
cells are by far the most appealing energy conversion devices we know of. They con-
vert  the  chemical  energy  of  hydrogen  or  other  fuels  directly  to  electricity  without
intermediate steps of combustion or mechanical rotation of a turbine. Their high ef-
ficiency, up to 60 percent or more, is a major advantage compared to traditional con-
version  routes  like  gasoline  engines  with  about  25  percent  efficiency.  The  combina-
tion  of  hydrogen,  fuel  cells,  and  electric  motors  has  the  potential  to  replace  many
of  our  much  less  efficient  energy  conversion  systems  that  are  based  on  combustion
of  fossil  fuels  driving  heat  engines  for  producing  electricity  or  mechanical  motion.
The  critical  challenges  for  fuel  cells  are  cost,  performance  and  reliability.  High
cost  arises  from  expensive  catalysts  and  membrane  materials;  performance  is  lim-
ited  by  the  low  chemical  activity  of  catalysts  and  ionic  conductivity  of  membranes;
and  reliability  depends  on  effective  design  and  integration  of  the  component  parts

of  the  fuel  cell.  Although  catalysts  have  been  known  for  centuries,  we  still  do  not
understand  why  or  how  they  work.  Our  approach  to  catalysts  is  largely  empirical;
we  often  find  that  the  best  catalysts  are  the  most  expensive  metals  like  platinum.
Nature, by contrast, uses inexpensive manganese to split water in green plants and
abundant iron to create molecular hydrogen from protons and electrons in bacteria.
These  natural  examples  show  that  cheaper,  more  effective  catalysts  can  be  found.
The challenge is to understand catalysis on the molecular level and use that under-
standing to design low cost, high performance catalysts targeted for fuel cells.

Membranes  are  another  critical  basic  research  challenge  for  fuel  cells.  Currently
fuel  cells  for  transportation  depend  almost  exclusively  on  one  membrane,  a  carbon-
fluorine polymer with sulfonic side chains. While this membrane is an adequate ion
conductor, it requires a carefully managed water environment and it limits the oper-
ating temperature of the fuel cell to below the boiling point of water. We need new
classes  of  membrane  materials  that  will  outperform  the  one  choice  currently  avail-
able.  Our  ability  to  design  alternative  membranes  is  limited  by  our  poor  under-
standing  of  their  ion  conduction  mechanisms.  Significant  basic  materials  research
is needed before practical new membrane materials can be found and developed.
Meeting the Challenges: Basic Research

The  three  challenges  outlined  above  are  critical  for  the  success  of  a  hydrogen

economy:

• Production of hydrogen by splitting water renewably;
• Storage of hydrogen at high density with fast release times; and
• Improved catalysts and membranes for fuel cells.

For  each  of  these  challenges,  incremental  improvements  in  the  present  state-of-
the-art  will  not  produce  a  hydrogen  economy  that  is  competitive  with  fossil  fuels.
Revolutionary breakthroughs are needed, of the kind that come only from high-risk/
high-payoff basic research.

The outlook for achieving such breakthroughs is promising. The recent worldwide
emphasis on nanoscience and nanotechnology opens up many new directions for hy-
drogen  materials  research.  All  of  the  critical  challenges  outlined  above  depend  on
understanding and manipulating hydrogen at the nanoscale. Nanoscience has given
us new fabrication tools, through top-down lithography and bottom-up self-assembly,
that  can  create  molecular  architectures  of  unprecedented  complexity  and
functionality.  The  explosion  of  bench-top  scanning  probes  and  the  development  of
high  intensity  sources  of  electrons,  neutrons  and  x-rays  for  advanced  materials  re-
search  at  DOE’s  user  facilities  at  Argonne  and  other  national  laboratories  brings
new  physical  phenomena  at  ever  smaller  length  and  time  scales  within  our  reach.
Numerical  simulations  using  density  functional  theory  and  running  on  computer
clusters of hundreds of nodes can now model the processes of water splitting, hydro-
gen  storage  and  release,  catalysis  and  ionic  conduction  in  membranes.  These  sci-
entific  developments  set  the  stage  for  the  breakthroughs  in  hydrogen  materials
science needed for a vibrant and competitive hydrogen economy.

Significant  progress  in  basic  research  for  the  hydrogen  economy  is  already  occur-
ring. Basic research on catalysis for fuel cells published in 2005 revealed that a sin-
gle  atomic  layer  of  platinum  on  certain  metal  substrates  has  more  catalytic  power
than the best catalysts now in use; this discovery could significantly reduce the cost
and  enhance  the  performance  of  fuel  cells.  A  new  route  for  splitting  water  using
sunlight  was  created  with  the  self-assembly  of  porphyrin  nanotubes  decorated  with
gold  and  platinum  nanoparticles.  These  tiny  nanoscale  composites  have  already
demonstrated water splitting driven by solar radiation, and they minimize manufac-
turing  cost  through  their  ability  to  self-assemble.  Models  of  hydrogen  storage  com-
pounds  using  density  functional  theory  now  predict  the  density  of  hydrogen  and
strength  of  its  binding  with  unparalleled  accuracy.  This  permits  an  extensive  theo-
retical  survey  of  potential  storage  materials,  many  more  than  could  be  practicably
fabricated and tested in the laboratory.
Conclusion

The  vision  of  the  hydrogen  economy  as  a  solution  to  foreign  energy  dependence,
environmental  pollution  and  greenhouse  gas  emission  is  compelling.  The  enormous
challenges  on  the  road  to  achieving  this  vision  can  be  addressed  with  innovative
high-risk/high-payoff basic research. The great contribution of basic research to soci-
ety  is  the  discovery  of  entirely  new  approaches  to  our  pressing  needs.  The  phe-
nomenal  advances  in  personal  computing  enabled  by  semiconductor  materials
science  and  their  impact  in  every  sphere  of  human  activity  illustrates  the  power  of
basic science to drive technology and enhance our daily lives. The challenges for the
hydrogen  economy  in  production,  storage  and  use  are  known.  Recent  developments

in  nanoscience,  in  high  intensity  sources  for  scattering  of  electrons,  neutrons  and
x-rays  from  materials  at  DOE’s  user  facilities,  and  in  numerical  simulation  using
density  functional  theory  open  promising  new  directions  for  basic  research  to  ad-
dress  the  hydrogen  challenges.  The  breakthroughs  that  basic  research  produces  in
hydrogen materials science will enable the realization of a mature, sustainable, and
competitive hydrogen economy.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Crabtree.
Dr. Heywood, you are recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOHN  B.  HEYWOOD,  DIRECTOR,  SLOAN
AUTOMOTIVE  LABORATORY,  MASSACHUSETTS  INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY
Dr.  HEYWOOD.  It  is  a  pleasure  to  be  here  to  testify  before  you

this morning.

This  hearing  is  focused  on  hydrogen.  I  want  to  spend  a  couple
of  minutes  developing  my  understanding  of  the  context  within
which  we  ought  to  think  about  hydrogen.  And  that—the  critical
part  of  that  context  is  that  our  U.S.  transportation  systems’  petro-
leum  consumption,  first  of  all,  is  so  large  that  it  is  almost  beyond
our  comprehension,  and  that  makes  changing  what  we  do  extraor-
dinarily difficult. And that consumption is growing at a significant
rate.  The  consumption  is  already  large.  Twenty-five  years  from
now,  it  is  projected  to  be  60  percent  higher.  Fifty  years  from  now,
it is expected to be twice what it is today.

What  are  our  options  for  dealing  with  this  in  a  broader  way  be-
fore  we  focus  on  hydrogen?  And  I  find  it  useful  to  talk  about  this
in two ways, to say there are two pars that we should be pursuing
aggressively.

And the first of these is to improve the performance of our main-
stream  internal  combustion  engines,  transmissions,  other  vehicle
components  step  by  step,  and  there  is  a  lot  of  potential  for  doing
that.  The  challenge  is,  it  costs  more,  so  the  price  goes  up.  It  goes

49

up  a  bit  if  the  improvement  is  small.  It  goes  up  more  if  the  im-
provements  are  larger.  Hybrid  vehicle  technology  is  a  clear  exam-
ple  of  that.  And  to  date,  the  response  of  the  market  to  somewhat
higher  cost  but  more  efficient  vehicles  has  not  been  to  reduce  fuel
consumption.  It  has  largely  been  traded  for  higher  vehicle—larger
vehicle size, higher vehicle weight, and better vehicle performance.
We  need  to  do  something  with  a  sense  of  urgency  to  reduce  our
petroleum  consumption  through  these  mainstream  technology  im-
provements, and we need to reinforce that more broadly within the
government  by  developing  a  combination  of  fiscal  and  regulatory
strategies  to  raise  the  importance  of  vehicle  fuel  consumption  in
the marketplace so that vehicle buyers and vehicle users are much
more  aware  of  their  fuel  consumption,  what  it  costs  them,  and
what it costs the Nation more broadly.

Now  the  second  path  relates  to  the  longer-term,  because  even
with  improvements  in  mainstream  technology,  without  drastic
changes in our technology and our vehicles, we will still be depend-
ent on petroleum-like fuels, and the greenhouse gas emissions that
come  from  our  transportation  sector  will  still  be  significant.  If  we
want  to  get  to  much  lower  energy  consumption,  recognizing  that
the availability of petroleum is going to decline as this century pro-
gresses, we need approaches like hydrogen and fuel cell technology
to make—to take the next step.

But  our  challenge  is  that  big  changes  in  technology,  whether  it
be  to  hydrogen  and  fuel  cells  or  to  advanced  batteries  and  elec-
tricity  as  the  energy  carrier,  take  a  long  time  to  have  an  impact.
Yes,  we  have  hydrogen  vehicles  out  there,  a  limited  number  al-
ready  driving  around,  they  cost  in  the  order  of  $1  million  each.  In
10  or  15  years,  there  will  be  trial  fleets,  prototypes  of  what  these
technologies could be, but the costs will still be substantially above
what conventional vehicle costs are.

Our  own  estimates  are  that  to  look  at  when  hydrogen  and  fuel
cells could have a noticeable impact on transportation’s energy con-
sumption,  we  judge  that  to  be  at  least  40  or  50  years  away.  That
is  much  longer  than  most  people  are  willing  to  acknowledge.  And
the reason is that most people leave out the time required to build
up  production  facilities  for  any  new  technology  so  that  it  is  both
sold  and  then  out  there  in  the  in-use  vehicle  fleet  in  sufficient
quantities driving around to have an impact on transportation’s en-
ergy consumption.

Let me comment more specifically for a couple of minutes on the

government programs that you are here reviewing today.

I  think  it  is  important  that  we  have  major  programs  developing
hydrogen technology and ideas and the technology needed for a hy-
drogen  infrastructure.  But  there  are  alternatives.  Hydrogen—suc-
cess  with  hydrogen  is  not  guaranteed,  and  there  are  alternatives
that  we  are  investing  in  but  not  with  the  same  sense  of  commit-
ment  and  urgency.  One  is  electric  vehicles  using  electricity  as  the
energy carrier, and the critical technology there is advanced energy
storage  batteries.  Another  is  producing  fuels  from  biomass  in  en-
ergy-efficient  ways.  Yes,  we  have  programs  designed  to  develop
those  technologies,  but  that  could  be  a  very  important  contributor
on  this  longer-term  time  scale,  and  we  don’t  understand  how  we

can best do that yet nor what the environmental impacts could well
be.

And then we have to think seriously about very different vehicle
concepts. I think we have really got to give up on the ‘‘living room
on wheels’’ current American vehicle. It has got to be a lot smaller
‘‘living room’’ with much smaller ‘‘furniture’’ in it, because it has to
be much lighter, because we cannot continue on this transportation
energy growth path that we are now on. And that will take inven-
tiveness in vehicle concepts as well as new materials and new fab-
rication and assembly processes.

All of these need strong emphasis. The future may not be hydro-
gen  alone.  It  may  be  hydrogen  plus  electricity  plus  biofuels  plus
very  different  vehicle  concepts  as  we  move  into  the  middle  of  this
century.  And  it  is  our  government’s  responsibility  to  invest  in  the
R&D that examines these options and starts to pull them into real
life where they could make a contribution.

Let me end by saying that I think our Department of Energy hy-
drogen program is a substantial program. It is well organized. The
DOE people managing this program interact strongly with the auto
and  energy  industries.  All  of  that  is  essential  to  producing  a  good
research and advanced development agenda. There is also a strong
strategic  plan  and  vision  behind  that  and  a  concrete  set  of  mile-
stones and deliverables that make this, I think, a very appropriate
program on hydrogen.

But  our  programs  that  are  dealing  with  improving  mainstream
technology,  engines,  transmissions,  and  other  vehicle  components,
new materials for vehicles, we have these programs, but they don’t
have  the  same  scope  and  intensity,  nor  do  our  efforts  on  advanced
batteries. And I offer for your consideration the need to build these
other programs up to the point where they are much more aggres-
sively pursuing these parallel opportunities to hydrogen.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN B. HEYWOOD

It  is  a  pleasure  to  testify  before  your  committee  today  on  meeting  the  future  en-
ergy  needs  of  our  U.S.  transportation  system.  I  have  been  working  in  this  area  at
MIT  for  the  past  37  years  doing  technical  research  and  broader  strategic  analysis
on how to reduce the environmental impacts and fuel consumption of our transpor-
tation  vehicles.  Summaries  of  our  groups’  relevant  recent  studies  are  attached  to
this testimony.

Our work, and that of others, looking ahead some 10–30 years underlines how im-
portant  it  is  that  we  in  the  U.S.  aggressively  pursue  two  parallel  paths  related  to
transportation  energy  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  By  we,  I  mean  the  relevant
people in the government, the auto and petroleum industries, the R&D community,
and the broader car buying and car using public.

The two paths are:

1. Working  effectively  to  improve  current  engine  and  drivetrain  technologies,
reduce  vehicle  weight  and  drag  so  we  significantly  reduce  vehicle  fuel  con-
sumption,  and  to  provide  incentives  to  individual  light-duty  vehicle  owners
and users to buy such improved technology vehicles and drive them less.

2. Developing  the  framework  and  knowledge  base  for  an  eventual  transition  to
transportation  energy  sources,  vehicle  technologies,  and  energy  consumption
rates  that  offset  the  expected  declining  availability  and  rising  cost  of  petro-
leum-based  fuels,  and  which  on  a  well-to-wheels  and  cradle-to-grave  basis
have low greenhouse gas emissions. This future transportation energy carrier
could be hydrogen, it could include electricity, and in part it could be biomass
derived fuels.

It  is  very  much  in  our  national  interest  to  pursue  both  these  paths  aggressively,
and with a real sense of urgency. The only feasible way to impact our steadily grow-
ing  U.S.  petroleum  imports  and  consumption  within  the  next  twenty-five  years  is
through  reducing  the  fuel  consumption  of  our  U.S.  transportation  fleet.  There  are
many ways to improve current vehicle technology to increase efficiency, but for most
of these, the initial vehicle cost goes up by more than past experience indicates this
consumer  market  will  support.  There  is  a  strong  need,  therefore,  for  the  U.S.  Gov-
ernment  to  provide  incentives  to  all  the  involved  stakeholders  (including  con-
sumers), as soon as possible, to ‘‘pull and push’’ this technology into the marketplace
and  ensure  it  is  used.  I  will  discuss  some  of  my  MIT  groups’  work  on  this  shortly.
However,  even  these  actions  will  not  result  in  much  lower  petroleum  consumption
and  very  low  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  U.S.  light-duty  fleet.  The  impor-
tance  of  these  actions  is  that  given  the  size  of  our  vehicle  fleet  (some  230  million
light-duty vehicle), this is the only way to get off the projected growth from today’s
light-duty  vehicle  fleets  consumption  of  140  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  a  year  (an
enormous amount!) to some 1.6 times that (220 billion gallons per year) twenty-five
years  from  now.  Whether  petroleum  resources  are  available  to  allow  this  growth  is
unclear. While it is likely that ‘‘unconventional petroleum’’ such as gasoline and die-
sel like fuels made from tar sands, natural gas, and biomass, will increase their con-
tribution, it will still be modest compared to this projected 25-year ahead total.

Thus  the  primary  driver  for  this  first  path  is  to  reduce  the  impact  that  higher
petroleum prices, petroleum availability concerns and shortages, and rising negative
balance of payment issues could have on our security, economy, and way of life.

In addition, however, success along this first path will have a significant enabling
impact  on  the  second  path.  It  is  anticipated  by  many  that  by  mid-century  we  will
need  (in  the  U.S.  and  elsewhere)  to  be  on  a  transition  path  to  much  lower  vehicle
fleet  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  If  the  transportation  energy  demand  in  the  U.S.  at
mid-century  is  as  large  as  many  current  projections  now  indicate,  then  that  transi-
tion task due to its size, technological difficulty, and likely cost is unbelievably chal-
lenging.  We  are  now  starting  to  learn  just  how  challenging  that  will  be.  If  through
improved efficiency and conservation we in the U.S. have cut that energy transition
challenge in half, just think how large a difference that will make.

It  will  not  be  easy  to  ‘‘cut  the  challenge  in  half.’’  Over  the  last  20–30  years,  con-
sumers have bought larger and heavier vehicles, with higher performance, and have
thus negated the roughly 30 percent improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency that im-
provements  in  engine  and  transmission  efficiencies,  reduced  drag,  and  materials
substitution  have  realized.  A  coordinated  set  of  government  actions  will  be  needed
to provide the push and pull to realize in-use fuel consumption benefits from future
improvements. My group has been analyzing such a coordinated regulatory and fis-
cal approach. Our assessment is that an integrated multi-strategy approach has the
best  chance  of  realizing  our  objectives,  since  it  shares  the  responsibility  even
handedly amongst the major stakeholders—industry and consumers, and each strat-
egy  reinforces  the  others.  Gains  only  will  come  if  we  tackle  all  aspects  of  the  prob-
lem simultaneously. Our proposal is to combine on improved version of CAFE regu-
lations  to  push  more  fuel-efficient  technology  into  new  vehicles  with  a  reinforcing
feebate system imposed at time of vehicle purchase (substantial fees for purchasers
who  buy  high  fuel-consuming  vehicles  and  rebates  for  those  who  buy  low  fuel  con-
suming vehicles). Such a feebate system could be revenue neutral. To reinforce more
fuel-efficient  choices  at  vehicle  purchase,  taxes  on  transportation  fuels  should  be
steadily increased year by year for the next few decades by some 10 cents per gallon
per  year.  These  additional  fuel  taxes  could  be  used  to  expand  the  now  depleted
Highway  Trust  Fund  revenues  to  renovate  our  deteriorating  highway  systems  and
provide adequate maintenance. On the fuel side, in parallel, targets and a schedule
could usefully be set for steadily increasing the amount of low greenhouse gas emit-
ting  biomass-based  transportation  fuels  produced  to  augment  our  petroleum-based
fuel supply. This would draw the petroleum and alternative fuel industries fully into
our  national  effort.  Details  of  our  proposal  area  given  in  the  attached  MIT  Energy
and Environment article, ‘‘A Multipronged Approach to Curbing Gasoline Use’’ June,
2004, and its Bandivadekar and Heywood reference. Such a multi-strategy approach
could also provide a transition period so major U.S. market suppliers with different
model  lineups,  and  health  care  and  pension  legacy  costs,  would  have  time  to  re-
spond appropriately.

Now  let  me  say  a  few  words  about  the  second  and  longer-term  path—working  to
implement  a  low  greenhouse  gas  emitting  energy  stream  for  transportation.  It  may
be  that  hydrogen  will  turn  out  to  be  the  best  of  the  low  greenhouse  gas  emitting
choices  we  have  identified  to  date.  There  are,  however,  other  options  that  warrant
substantial  federal  and  industry  R&D.  The  time  scales  for  radical  changes  in  tech-
nology  to  be  implemented  and  have  impact  are  long,  much  longer  than  we  realize.

My group at MIT is working hard to understand these important time scales better.
There  are  several  sequential  steps  that  a  new  automotive  technology  must  go
through  before  that  technology  becomes  a  large  enough  fraction  of  the  on-the-road
vehicle  fleet  to  make  a  difference.  The  first  step  is  developing  the  new  technology
to  the  point  where  it  is  competitive  in  the  marketplace  with  standard  technology
vehicles.  While  more  expensive  new-technology  more-efficient  vehicles  can  be  sub-
sidized,  this  can  only  be  done  to  push  their  introduction  up  to  modest  levels.  Once
market competitive, the production volumes of the new technology components must
expand to a significant fraction of total new vehicle production. For engines, for ex-
ample, this takes one to two decades. For fuel cell hybrid vehicles we estimate this
to be 20–30 years. Then the new technology must penetrate the in-use vehicle fleet
and be driven significant mileage, which takes almost as long as the production ex-
pansion  step.  Thus  for  internal  combustion  engine  hybrids  the  total  time  to  notice-
able impact is expected to be some 30-plus years. For hydrogen and fuel-cell hybrids
it is likely to be more than 50 years. Hence my emphasis on the first path for near-
er-term improvements, and my judgment that any transition to hydrogen on a large
scale is many decades away. (See MIT Energy & Environment article, ‘‘New Vehicle
Technologies: How Soon Can They Make a Difference,’’ March, 2005, attached).

Now,  some  comments  on  a  transition  to  hydrogen-fueled  vehicles.  First,  the  ra-
tionale  for  attempting  such  a  transition  is  to  significantly  reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions  from  our  transportation  systems  in  the  longer-term.  Thus  the  source  of
the  energy  used  to  produce  hydrogen  is  critical.  It  would  have  to  be  either  coal  or
natural  gas  with  effective  carbon  capture  and  sequestration,  or  nuclear  power  sys-
tems  which  generate  both  hydrogen  and  electricity.  Electrolysis  of  water  with  ‘‘re-
newable  electricity’’  from  solar  or  wind  energy  does  not  appear  a  plausible  way  to
produce  hydrogen;  it  makes  much  more  sense  to  use  renewable  electricity  to  dis-
place coal in the electric power generating sector. Thus not only are there major hy-
drogen  fuel  cell  technology  issues  (including  cost)  to  be  resolved,  there  are  also
major  technical  and  cost  challenges  in  the  production,  distribution  and  storage  of
hydrogen  to  be  resolved  as  well.  Hydrogen  produced  directly  from  fossil  fuels  with-
out carbon sequestration, or from the electric power grid via electrolysis, even when
used  in  fuel  cell  powered  vehicles  (which  could  be  significantly  more  efficient  than
internal  combustion  engine  powered  vehicles),  will  not  save  energy  nor  reduce
greenhouse gases.

Are  there  alternatives  that  warrant  greater  federal  resources?  The  above  discus-
sion  suggests  that  electric  vehicles  with  advanced  high-energy-density  batteries  re-
charged  with  electricity  from  renewable  or  low  CO2 electric  power  systems  is  one
at  least  partial  alternative.  Such  vehicles  would  be  range  limited,  but  if  that  range
is more than say 200 miles these could be a substantial fraction of the market. Effi-
ciently produced biofuels can also be low net CO2 emitting and the extent these can
contribute  is  not  yet  clear.  New,  much  lighter  weight,  vehicle  concepts,  may  be  sig-
nificantly smaller in size, are also likely to be a significant and necessary long-term
option. All of these should be important parts of the U.S. Government’s R&D trans-
portation  energy  initiatives.  While  they  are  part  of  the  Government’s  current  port-
folio, the level of funding, strategic planning, and industry and R&D community in-
volvement should be increased.

Our  longer-term  list  of  plausible  efficient  vehicle  technologies  and  the  energy
sources that go with them is too short, and the difficulties in realizing these options
in the real world are so challenging, that a much larger federal effort on this second
path I have been discussing is warranted.

The  above  discussion  broadly  to  addresses  the  first  two  questions  asked  in  the
Committee’s  letter  requesting  testimony.  Let  me  now  provide  a  more  focused  sum-
mary of my response.
Question  1:  How  might  the  future  regulatory  environment,  including  pos-
sible  incentives  for  advanced  vehicles  and  regulations  of  safety  and  emis-
sions, affect a transition to hydrogen-fueled motor vehicles? How could the
Federal Government most efficiently accelerate such a transition?

I  have  explained  how  important  it  is  for  the  U.S.  Federal  Government  through
regulatory  and  fiscal  policies  to  reduce  the  energy  requirements  of  our  total  trans-
portation  system.  Not  only  would  this  help  reduce  our  petroleum  consumption  and
thus our oil imports in the nearer-term; it would also make the task of a future hy-
drogen  transition  (or  more  complex  mix  of  low  greenhouse  gas  emitting  energy
sources and technologies) significantly less challenging.
Question 2: Is the current balance of funding between hydrogen-related re-
search  and  research  on  advanced  vehicle  technologies  that  might  be  de-
ployed in the interim before a possible transition to hydrogen appropriate?

What advanced vehicle choices should the Federal Government be funding
between now and when the transition to a hydrogen economy occurs? How
are  automakers  using,  or  how  do  they  plan  to  use,  the  advanced  vehicle
technology developed for hydrogen-fueled vehicles to improve the perform-
ance of conventional vehicles? Are automakers likely to improve fuel econ-
omy and introduce advanced vehicles without government support?

The  government’s  FreedomCAR  and  Fuels  program  is  a  thoughtfully  structured
program  of  significant  scale  intended  to  advanced  hydrogen  fuel  and  vehicle  tech-
nologies. It is a partnership between DOE, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, GM and several
petroleum companies. Its focus is on applied research with some pre-competitive ad-
vanced development. The program plan has had, and continues to have, substantial
industry input. DOE cost shares major advanced development projects with the auto
companies. The companies involved have substantial programs of their own in these
areas,  though  the  details  of  these  programs  are  largely  proprietary.  This  program
approach in my judgment does a reasonable job of using federal funds to encourage
the  necessary  development  of  new  and  better  ideas,  and  new  knowledge  related  to
hydrogen and its use in transportation.

The FreedomCAR and Fuels Program also supports activities intended to improve
the  efficiency  of  mainstream  engine  and  propulsion  system  technologies.  Given  the
importance  of  the  first  pathway  I  have  described,  this  federal  effort  should  be  ex-
panded.  Also,  efforts  on  advanced  battery  research  and  development,  and  biofuels
should  be  expanded  to  better  meet  their  potential  importance  in  the  longer-term.
The  Federal  Government  must  play  the  role  of  supporting  a  broad  portfolio  of  re-
search  relevant  to  transportation  energy  and  transportations  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions and involve all sectors of the R&D community that can contribute. Our univer-
sities, the source of the technical leadership we will need over the next several dec-
ades, must be more actively involved.
Question 3: What role should the Federal Government play in the standard-
ization of local and international codes and standards that affect hydrogen-
fueled vehicles, such as building, safety, interconnection, and fire codes?

I  have  not  addressed  this  question  directly.  Due  to  the  long  time  scales  involved
in any transition to hydrogen or other new technologies, this is not as urgent a task
as is technology development. However, as is already happening in the FreedomCAR
and  Fuels  Program,  work  on  these  issues  should  be  underway  with  the  relevant
Standards and Codes organizations, and with the industries involved.

DISCUSSION

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Heywood. And

thank you to all of the panelists.

We will now move to Member questions.
And I will yield myself five minutes.
I had the opportunity to drive a hydrogen car about a month ago,
and  we  are  going  to  have  to  change  all  our  terminology.  You  don’t
have  a  gearshift.  You  just  push  a  button  for  drive.  You  can’t  step
on  the  gas.  I  don’t  know  how  we  are  going  to  get  used  to  saying
‘‘stepping on the hydrogen’’ or something. It just doesn’t seem to fit
as well. But it was quite an experience. And then opening the hood
and  being  able  to  put  your  hand  on  the  engine  and  it  is  not  hot,
it  is  cool.  It  is—it  must  be  energy  efficient.  But  I  understand  that
they  are  talking  about  it  being  within  the  next  decade  that  this
might be coming out.

But  my  question  really  goes  to  the  development  of  the  fuel  and
how  that  is  going  to  be.  And  I  think  it  was  Dr.  Bodde  that  men-
tioned  that  the  type  of  hydrogen  that  would  be  used.  I  understood
from that that it was either—the car that I was driving was liquid
hydrogen,  which  was  stored  under  the  back  seat.  And  then  they—
but  they  haven’t  decided  whether  compressed  hydrogen  or  liquid
would  be  something  that  would  be  used.  I—this  was  a  GM  car.
Sorry.  But  I  know  you  are  all  working  together.  But—and  then  it
can  be  filled  right  from  the—again,  it  couldn’t  be  called  a  gas
pump.  We  would  have  to  change  to  the  hydrogen  pump  or  what-
ever.  But  are  we  really  that  close?  It  seemed  that  they  hadn’t—at
least  this—and  I  am—and  from  all  of  your  testimony,  I  see  that

there  hasn’t  been  a  decision  yet,  but  it  seemed  to  me  between  liq-
uid  and  compressed  or  whatever  we  might  find.  It  is  kind  of  like
beta  versus  VHS.  You  know,  which  is  going  to  be  the  way  to  go,
because  will  this  be  made,  you  know,  on  an  industry-wide  basis
with the research from—on the FreedomCAR? How are we—who is
making those decisions, and how is this all integrated with the De-
partment of Energy and the basic research?

So whoever would like to answer that. Mr. Faulkner.
Mr.  FAULKNER.  Well,  I  could  start,  and  some  of  my  colleagues

can fill in.

I  think  the  timeline  that  we  are  working  on  with  our  industry
partners is 2015 for a commercialization decision. The Department
of  Energy,  the  government,  doesn’t  make  these  vehicles,  doesn’t
make  the  fuels.  We  work  on  research  and  development  to  help
them, our private sector partners, make these decisions. So looking
at  that  time  scale,  roughly  2015,  start  to  make  the  entry  point  in
the market about 2020. There are some cars on the road. You have
driven  them,  I  have  driven  them.  But  they  are  not  cost-effective
yet.  There  are  technology  issues  we  have  to  sort  through,  but  that
is  the  time  scale  we  are  on,  and  every  year,  we  are  progressing
closer to that.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Any other comments?
Dr. CRABTREE. Yes.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Dr. Crabtree.
Dr.  CRABTREE.  You  mentioned  two  alternatives:  liquid  or  com-
pressed  gas.  I  think  both  of  those  have  deficiencies  that,  in  the
long-term,  really  won’t  give  us  the  driving  range  that  we  need.
What  we  need  to  do  is  find  a  way  to  store  hydrogen  as  part  of  a
solid material as a hydrogen compound. And that is the thing that,
really, we can’t do yet. If you look at what we could do in the next
five years, we could do either liquid storage or gas storage, but we
really  don’t  know  how  to  go  solid-state  storage,  and  that  is  the
one—that  is  the  area  that  we  need  to  do  if  we  are  going  to  have
a long-time, long-term impact.

So this really is a basic research issue.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Okay.
Dr. Bodde.
Dr. BODDE. Let me say that I concur with that completely.
We  know  perfectly  well  how  to  compress  hydrogen  now.  The
issue,  though,  is  what  is  going  to  become  of  an  automobile  that  is
given  the  casual  maintenance  that  our  cars  do  and  that  is  fueled
by a compressed gas at 10,000 p.s.i. for the lightest element on the
Earth?  Now  as  we  all  sit  here  in  this  hearing  room,  if  your  car  is
doing  what  my  car  is  doing,  it  is  out  in  the  parking  lot  dripping
atmospheric  pressure  fluids  onto  the  paving.  Imagine  what  would
happen if it were a very high compressed tank of hydrogen.

So  I  think  for  demonstration  fleets,  that  will  work  fine.  In  order
to pioneer the opening of the technology, it will work just fine. But
for  the  long-term  effective  hydrogen  economy,  I  agree  with  Dr.
Crabtree. I think we have to have some form of solid-state storage
or some form of that near atmospheric pressure storage.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Dr. Heywood.
Dr.  HEYWOOD.  Let  me  broaden  that  and  say  that  this  is  one  of
many areas where we are learning that what we have today is fan-

tastic. Gasoline and diesel fuel have an extraordinarily high energy
density,  lots  of  energy  per  unit  volume,  or  mass,  and  they  are  liq-
uids.  And  we  are  struggling  mightily,  and  we  will  need  new  ideas
and  research  to  explore  those  ideas  before  we  can  make  gaseous
fuels,  like  hydrogen,  manageable  in  anywhere  near  the  same  way.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you. Thank you.
Mr. Chernoby.
Mr. CHERNOBY. Just in closing, I would agree with the comments

of all of my colleagues here.

At  DaimlerChrysler,  we  do  believe  that  compressed  hydrogen  is
probably  the  near-term  alternative  for  limited  fleet  use,  but  in  the
long-term,  we  absolutely  must  provide  the  customer  with  a  range.
We  absolutely  must  provide  them  with  the  space,  as  Dr.  Heywood
said earlier, that they enjoy in their moving ‘‘living room,’’ and that
is  going  to  require  something  different  than  compressed  hydrogen,
and  we  do  not  think  that  liquid,  at  this  point,  from  what  we  see,
is the answer. There has to be basic research to find something else
that  is  going  to  find  something  that  is  going  to  satisfy  all  of  those
needs.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  So  it  really  will  be  a  conglomerate  that
will  make  this—everyone  will  probably  be  on  the  same  track  be-
cause of the necessity when we find the right type of fuel?

Dr. CRABTREE. It is interesting, if you look at what is—what the
commercial  options  are  now  that—the  demonstration  fleets,  some
are  liquid,  some  are  gas.  Each  one  has  their  own  proponents.  Not
too many are solid-state. That is the one, I think, that has to come.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
Going  back  and  forth,  Mr.  Carnahan,  would  you  be  ready,  or
should we have one more question from the other side of the aisle?

[No response.]
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you. Chairman Inglis, you are rec-

ognized for five minutes.

Chairman INGLIS. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
You know, when I was a kid, Alcoa Aluminum used to advertise
on  ‘‘Meet  the  Press’’  with  a  very  effective  jingle  that  said,  ‘‘Alcoa
can’t wait. We can’t wait for tomorrow.’’ And I wonder whether the
role that we have is to be saying to the academics, ‘‘We can’t wait.’’
And I wonder if the role of Mr. Chernoby and people in the private
sector  is  to  say,  ‘‘We  have  got  to  do  it,  because  we  want  to  make
some  money  at  it.’’  But  I  wonder  if  our  role  is  really  to  say,  like
President Kennedy did in 1961, we have got to get to the Moon be-
fore the end of the decade.

So  maybe  you  could  comment  on  what  is  the  role  of  the  people
up here, the government folks. What should we be saying? It seems
to  me  that  the  statistics  that  you  have  cited  are  alarming.  The—
two  things  are  alarming.  One  is  our  use  of  fuel,  as  Dr.  Heywood
talked about, and the other is the length of time that we are hear-
ing.  So  these  seem  to  be  on  a  collision  course.  We  have  got  this
enormous  use,  and  we  have  got  this  time  that  is  working  against
us.  And  so  one  of  my  items  here  was  talking  about  commitment,
which is a question for us in the government. What kind of commit-
ments  should  we  make  to  really  moving  this  along?  And  anybody
want to comment on what should be the role of government in this

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:02 Jan 27, 2006 Jkt 022549 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\072005\22549.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

process  to  light  the  fire  on  all  of  the  researchers  and  to  really  in-
sist, like Alcoa, ‘‘We can’t wait until tomorrow’’?

Dr.  HEYWOOD.  And  I  am  glad  you  said,  ‘‘We  can’t  wait  until  to-
morrow,’’  because  that  is  absolutely  the  case.  And  in  some  areas,
we are getting a move on. We have got a sizable hydrogen program.
In other areas, we are not, particularly, in my view, in government
efforts  to  regulate  through  fiscal  and  regulations  like  CAFE,  to
force  movement.  I  think  the  government’s  responsibility  is  to  both
push and pull these technologies into the marketplace.

Research  is  another  way  of  sort  of  smoothing,  lubricating,  seed-
ing that process. And I think that is a very important thing for you
to think about as well. But I urge you to hang on to this. We can’t
wait.  We  have  got  to  assess  how  this  problem  is  developing  and
getting  worse  and  sort  out  what  we,  government  and  others,  can
do collectively to get a move on in resolving these problems.

Chairman INGLIS. Yes, sir.
Dr. Crabtree.
Dr.  CRABTREE.  So  you  mentioned  getting  to  the  moon,  which  is
often applied to hydrogen and sometimes to the larger energy prob-
lem  as  well.  I  think  there  is  one  difference  from  the  Apollo  pro-
gram.  There,  President  Kennedy  could  say,  ‘‘Let  us  do  it,’’  and  he
had  the  NASA  do  it.  It  was  very  well  coordinated.  In  the  case  of
energy,  cars,  and  hydrogen,  it  has  to  be  sort  of  the  economy.  It  is
a complex system. It is a lot of people interacting and making inde-
pendent decisions, so you don’t get that direction from the top.

So I think what the government can do is incentivize that activ-
ity.  And  there  are  really  two  aspects  to  it.  One  is  what  we  can  do
now,  sort  of  incremental  hydrogen  economy,  and  we  have  heard
some of the—my colleagues have talked about that. One is what we
would  like  to  be  able  to  do,  the  mature  one  that  we  need,  let  us
say, 20 or 30 years from now that would really have an energy im-
pact.  The  first  one  is  sort  of  a  commercial  demonstration  stage
now. So you need one kind of incentive for that.

The  second  one  is  really  basic  research.  You  need  a  completely
different  kind  of  incentive  for  that.  You  have  to  work  on  both  lev-
els,  and  soon  these  two,  sort  of—these  two  prongs  will  come  to-
gether and we will get the result that we want.

Chairman  INGLIS.  Here  is  my  idea.  Somebody  comment  on  this,
maybe  Mr.  Chernoby  or  Dr.  Bodde  might  want  to  talk  about  this,
is  that  gas  at  $3  a  gallon  lights  a  fire  in  the  consuming  public.
When  it  gets  to  that  level  and  you  go  to  fill  up  your  SUV  and  it
is  $42,  I  think  you  say,  ‘‘This  can’t  be.’’  I  mean,  ‘‘I  can’t  continue
to  spend  $42  per  fill-up.’’  Right?  I  mean,  does  that  light  the—
DaimlerChrysler,  does  that  get  you  going?  Does  that  get  you  ex-
cited?

Mr. CHERNOBY. Well, a couple of things.
You talked about commitment of the researchers. I can just share
that  the  researchers  we  deal  with,  I  can  assure  you,  there  is  huge
commitment,  huge  tenacity  and  focus  on  trying  to  get  these  prob-
lems  solved,  so  I  am  not  worried,  really,  about  the  motivation  of
the researchers. But similar to what Dr. Heywood said earlier and
what you just mentioned, I think the role of government is two crit-
ical areas.

Number one, it is obviously to help all of us in a pre-competitive
environment with basic research, because we have got to overcome
these challenges. But then you talked about the marketplace. That
is the key here. That is—for me, that is the big difference between
this challenge and the Apollo program. Without the marketplace in
poll,  there  is  no  penetration,  and  without  product  penetration,
there is no motivation to build an infrastructure.

So  I  would  say,  short-term,  it  is  not  just  about  seeing  the  re-
search, but it is about sitting down with all of us, the energy indus-
try,  the  auto  industry,  and  other  constituents,  and  we  have  got  to
talk  about  how  can  we  get  that  motivation  in  the  marketplace.  I
don’t personally—and this is not speaking for the company, person-
ally,  I  don’t  believe  $3  is  going  to  do  it.  I  mean,  you  are—like  Dr.
Heywood said, I mean, you look at the costs and the challenges we
have  to  overcome  on  some  of  these  technologies  today,  there  has
got to be a pretty big incentive or a reason for a customer to value
and move to that. That is why we think there is a lot of transition,
like  Dr.  Heywood  said,  that  we  are  going  to  go  through  before  we
ultimately  get  to  the  hydrogen  economy.  But  working  closely  with
all  of  us  on  what  is  the  business  model  going  to  be  and  how  can
the  government  play  a  role  in  that  business  model  to  make  it  via-
ble for not only an automotive company but an energy company as
well  to  make  this  a  reality.  But  without  the  marketplace,  it  is  not
going anywhere.

the 

Dr.  BODDE.  My  observation  on  federal  policies,  if  you  allow  me.
If you look at the history of federal policy and energy, going back
to the first Arab oil embargo of October of 1973, the chief problem,
as  I  see  it,  has  been  consistency.  We  have  gone  from  one  thing  to
another  thing.  When  oil  prices  were  high  in  the  1970s,  there  was
Project  Independence.  When  oil  prices  fell  in  the  1980s,  it  was  all,
‘‘Well, what the heck. Let the market reign here.’’ I think the chief
ingredient of any effective federal policy is going to be consistency.
Durability  over 
long-term.  That  allows  entrepreneurs,
innovators,  investors  to  plan  on  the  economic  regime  that  is  going
to  prevail  over  the  time  scale  that  it  takes  for  them  to  bring  tech-
nologies into the marketplace.

And so item one, I would say, is consistency.
Item  two  is  attention  to  the  demand  side.  All  of  this  talk  about
research,  about  CAFE  standards,  and  so  forth,  all  deals  with  the
supply  side,  that  is  the  supply  of  vehicles,  the  supply  of  fuels.
There has to be a demand side pull from consumers as well.

Now  it  is  interesting  to  observe,  as  Dr.  Heywood  has,  the  re-
sponse to the more fuel-efficient vehicles that haven’t proven to be
the more fuel-economic vehicles. Fuel-efficiency, that is in the sense
of moving metal down the road, has improved consistently over the
last  20  years.  Fuel  economy  has  been  flat.  The  reason  is  the  in-
crease  efficiency  was  taken  as  greater  weight,  as  greater  accelera-
tion,  as  greater  vehicle  performance,  and  this  is  what  the  market-
place is demanding.

My guess, also, is that at $3 a gallon, that might not change very
much,  and  I  think  serious  consideration  has  to  be  given  to  other
demand-side  policies  that  start  to  create  a  consumer  interest  in
translating greater efficiency into greater economy.

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Sir,  your  red  light  has  been  on  for  a  while,  but
you  raise  a  really  fascinating  and  philosophical  question.  Could  I
respond for a minute?

Chairman INGLIS. If the Chair will allow it.
Mr. FAULKNER. Is that allowed?
You  noted  the  alarming  rise  in  the  use  of  oil.  That  is  true.  That
has been going on for some time. Many are aware of that, and the
length  of  time  we  are  talking  about,  2015,  2020,  full  breakout  in
the  market  2030,  2040,  2050,  and  then  you  noted,  we  can’t  wait.
But I think—it may be unpopular, but I think, in a sense, it is our
duty  to  say  we  have  to  wait,  not  that  that  is  complacent  but  that
fundamental  science  doesn’t  occur  overnight.  Some  of  these  things
everyone  has  talked  about,  breakthroughs  that  are  needed,  and  if
you  are  set  on  the  right  pace  research  and  development.  You  talk
about commercialization of these technologies in the private sector.
It is going to take a while to affect those changes.

And  I  would  note  that  the  President  sees  the  urgency  of  that,
that  is  why  he  set  the  vision.  That  is  what  he  talked  about  this
fundamental issue we have to address. And for the government, the
federal  role,  the  Department  of  Energy,  we  have  to  manage  it.
There  are  several  different  programs.  It  is  a  difficult  task  to  inte-
grate the Office of Science’s fundamental research in our office and
other departments.

And  Congress’s  role  is  to  hold  our  feet  to  the  fire.  Ask  us  for
metrics.  Ask  us  to  come  in  and  justify  what  we  are  spending.  And
I  think,  as  the  President  has  said,  and  the  Secretary,  pass  an  en-
ergy bill.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The  gentleman  from  Missouri,  Mr.  Carnahan,  is  recognized  for

five minutes.

Mr. CARNAHAN. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
Welcome  to  all  of  you,  and  this  is  a  very  timely  and  important
discussion that we are having here today. And I was fascinated just
recently  reading  the—if  you  haven’t  seen  it,  look  at  the  August
issue of National Geographic on things that are coming after petro-
leum, basically, and they highlight a lot of these new technologies.
But I want to particularly ask Mr. Chernoby, or anybody else on
the panel, about the FreedomCAR research and where you see that
going  from  here,  and  really  give  me  a  better  idea  of  where  that  is
today.

Mr. CHERNOBY. I would summarize a few key points.
We have talked a lot about hydrogen and fuel cells and hydrogen
storage  today.  If  you  look  at  the  FreedomCAR  research  portfolio,
we  manage  a  portfolio  that  is  even  broader  than  that.  Similar  to
what Dr. Heywood said earlier, it is critical as well, as we research
things for the long-term, what can we be doing to implement things
we  learn  in  the  short-term?  There  is  quite  a  bit  of  research  going
on  still  in  lightweight  advanced  materials,  very  important,  and  as
soon  as  something  gets  on  the  shelf  that  engineers  can  grab  and
use and the supply base can figure out how to process, we will im-
plement  it,  if  it  provides  the  right  value  to  the  customer:  lighter
weight  vehicles,  more  fuel  efficiency.  We  don’t  have  to  wait  for  a
hydrogen  economy.  There  is  basic  battery  research  going  on,  an-
other critical enabler.

We have several examples like that that we manage in this pre-
competitive environment at FreedomCAR. So we absolutely believe
that—DaimlerChrysler,  and  I  think  my  compatriots  and  Ford  and
GM  would  agree,  this  is  absolutely  the  best  way  to  make  sure  we
compile  some  of  the  brightest  minds,  not  only  in  industry,  but  in
academia  and  the  other  research  environments  around  the  world.
And  it  is  that  combination  of  minds  that  is  actually  going  to  help
us get these breakthroughs to market, not just in the long-term for
the  hydrogen,  but  feeding  in  all  of  the  other  things  we  are  doing
in our portfolio to provide benefit in the near-term as well.

Mr. FAULKNER. Sir, if I could add, the Secretary——
Mr. CARNAHAN. Yes, please.
Mr.  FAULKNER.The  Secretary  of  Energy,  Sam  Bodman,  was  out
in  Michigan  recently  where  he  did  two  events  in  one  day.  He  cut
the  ribbon,  groundbreaking  of  the  new  solar  factory,  but  he  also
was  with  Mr.  Chernoby  and  his  colleagues  to  talk  about  renewing
two agreements with the U.S. Car Group. One of them was on bat-
teries and one of them was on materials.

And  I  think  that  kind  of  success  that  we  have  in  partnering  to-
gether  with  the  auto  industry,  if  there  wasn’t  success,  they
wouldn’t  be  wanting  to  sign  up  and  renew  these  agreements.  And
there  are—am  I  correct  that  the  batteries  that  we  have  pioneered
in that consortium are now on every hybrid in America?

Mr. CHERNOBY. Yeah, absolutely. Some of the very basic and pre-
liminary  work  on  what  we  call  nickel  metal  hydride  batteries  was
done through that consortium, and that is what you will find in ba-
sically every hybrid vehicle on the road today.

Mr.  CARNAHAN.  We  have  also  talked  about  several  incentives
here  today,  and  I  have  worked  with  some  here  in  the  Congress
about instituting a tax credit that would go partially to consumers
and partially to manufacturers to help in this transitional time pe-
riod to these alternative fuel vehicles.

What  kind  of  impact  do  you  see  that  having?  Some  have  argued
because the demand is growing and the technology is coming online
that  those  kinds  of  incentives  aren’t  necessary.  And  I  would  be  in-
terested in your comments about that.

Mr.  CHERNOBY.  Well,  I  would  add,  similar  to  what  Dr.  Heywood

said earlier, let the data speak for itself.

If  you  look  at  the  penetration  of  these—some  of  these  tech-
nologies,  it  has  not  been  in  astronomically  large  numbers.  I  mean,
they  occupy  a  very,  very  small  percentage  of  the  annual  vehicle
sales  in,  not  only  the  United  States,  but  around  the  world.  So  any
incentive  that  is  going  to  help  the  customer  find  the  right  value
equation, and that is why I urge you to think about not only incen-
tives—don’t  pick  a  single  technology.  Think  about  the  broad  range
of technologies. One may be more attractive to one customer versus
another.  And  that  is  what  we  have  got  to  focus  on,  providing  the
ability  for  those  technologies  to  penetrate  across  as  broad  of  a
range  of  the  market  as  we  can.  We,  at  DaimlerChrysler,  feel  we
very  much  ought  to  focus  on  today’s  clean  and  advanced  diesel  to
augment  the  hybrid  discussion,  because  there  are  a  lot  of  cus-
tomers who drive in a highway-driving environment.

So  absolutely,  we  believe  that  we  have  to  do  something,  as  Dr.
Bodde  said,  on  the  demand  side  and  continue  to  do  so,  not  only  in
the long-term hydrogen economy, but in the short-term as well.

Dr.  BODDE.  That  said,  however,  perhaps  we  should  not  be  too
pessimistic  about  reading  the  current  data.  It  is  characteristic  of
any  technology,  if  there  is  a  long  gestation  period  in  which  not
much  seems  to  be  happening  in  the  marketplace  in  which  market
share  growth  and  market  penetration  doesn’t  happen,  then  a  tip-
ping point is reached and the technology takes off.

I mean, you look at Internet use, Internet subscribers. The Inter-
net  has  been  around  for  a  long  time,  and  it  is  only  in  the  last  five
years that we get this vertical—near-vertical acceleration.

My guess is that the same thing is going to happen with the hy-
brid  vehicles,  perhaps  hybrid  diesel  vehicles.  The  same  thing  is
going to happen with the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

What we need to be about is to look at the conditions needed for
that  marketplace  takeoff  to  occur  and  to  work  specifically  to  put
those  conditions  in  place  so  that  the  market  itself  will  then  take
it over.

Mr. FAULKNER. Just another comment.
I think it is important not to get too far ahead of the technology
in  incentives.  The  President  has  proposed  tax  incentives  for  hy-
brids,  but  I  think  the  fuel  cell  vehicles  are  still  a  ways  down  the
road, and you can consider those as that technology improves. Tim-
ing is very important.

Dr.  CRABTREE.  Briefly,  that—we  heard  a  lot  about  incentivizing
and  getting  the  technology  out  there  for  the  consumer  and  for  the
manufacturer,  but  I  think  it  is  important  to  incentivize  the  re-
search as well. The things we can do now and put out now or that
consumers  can  decide  about  now  and  make  now  are  really  not  the
ones  that  we  want  to  do  20  years  from  now  to  have  a  big  impact
on energy.

So  we  shouldn’t  leave  that  basic  research  component  out  of  the

equation.

Mr. CARNAHAN. Thank you.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Timing is everything.
Mr. CARNAHAN. Thank you, Madame Chair.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. And your time has expired.
And  the  gentleman  from  Maryland,  Mr.  Bartlett,  is  recognized

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
I have many questions, but time will permit, perhaps, only three

for five minutes.

quick ones.

I  understand  that  if  we  were  to  wave  a  magic  wand  and  every
American  car  could  have  a  fuel  cell  in  it  with  platinum  as  a  cata-
lyst that one generation—and it doesn’t last all that long, I under-
stand,  but  one  generation  would  use  all  of  the  platinum  in  all  of
the world. Is that true?

Secondly, right now today, 85 percent of all of the energy we use
in  this  country  comes  from  fossil  fuels.  Are  you  all  familiar  with
Hubbard’s  Peak?  Do  you  know  what  is  meant  by  Hubbard’s  Peak?
Okay.  We  now  may  be  at  Hubbard’s  Peak  in  terms  of  oil.  If  that
is true, gas is not far behind.

And I would caution, don’t be sanguine about this enormous sup-
ply  of  coal.  At  current  use  rates,  it  will  last  250  years.  If  you  in-
creased  its  use  exponentially  only  two  percent  a  year,  and  we  will
have to do more than that if we run down Hubbard’s Peak with gas
and oil, it lasts 85 years. When you recognize that you probably are
not going to run your car by putting the trunk full of coal, you are
going  to  have  to  convert  it  to  a  gas  or  a  liquid,  now  you  have
shrunk  it  to  50  years.  That  is  all  that  is  out  there  at  two  percent
growth  rate  and  converting  it  to  some  form  we  are  going  to  use.
Only 15 percent of our energy today comes from renewables. I in-
clude  in  that  the  eight  percent  that  comes  from  nuclear  and  only
seven  percent  from  true  renewables.  Since  hydrogen  is  not  an  en-
ergy source, you will always use more energy producing the hydro-
gen  than  you  get  out  of  it.  Where  are  we  going  to  get  all  of  this
energy  as  we  run  down  Hubbard’s  Peak?  Are  we  going  to  have  a
really  nuclear  nation,  because  the  effective  growth  in  energy  from
the renewables is really pretty darn limited?

And  the  third  question  deals  with:  all  of  you  seem  to  agree  that
if  hydrogen—if  we  are  going  to  move  to  a  hydrogen  economy,  you
have  got  to  have  solid-state  storage.  Is  there  something  in  the
science  that  inherently  makes  hydrogen  storage  a  higher  density
than  electron  storage?  What  you  are  really  talking  about  now  is
just another battery, aren’t you, which is what hydrogen solid-state
storage  is  going  to  be?  Another  battery?  In  the  science,  is  there
something  inherently  so  superior  about  hydrogen  storage  that  it  is
going to be a better battery than storing electrons?

Is  it  true  about  platinum  that  one  generation  of  American  cars
lasting, what, 200 hours for each solar—for each fuel cell, we have
used all of the platinum in all of the world?

Dr. CRABTREE. Well, may I comment on that?
I really don’t—I have heard that statement as well, and I haven’t

tried to verify it.

Mr. BARTLETT. Could you, for the record, all of you, give us some
input  on  that?  It  is  really  nice  to  know  that,  because  if  that  is  the
path we are running down, it is not going to be a very fruitful one.

INSERT FOR THE RECORD BY DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

A  study  by  TIAX,  LLC  determined  that  there  are  sufficient  platinum  resources
in  the  ground  to  meet  long-term  projected  platinum  demand  if  the  amount  of  plat-
inum  in  fuel  cell  systems  is  reduced  to  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  target
level. The DOE-sponsored study shows that total world platinum demand (including
jewelry,  fuel  cell  and  industrial  applications)  by  2050  would  be  20,000  metric  tons
against  a  total  projected  resource  of  76,000  metric  tons.  This  study  assumes  that
fuel cell vehicles attain 80 percent market penetration by 2050 (from U.S., Western
Europe, China, India and Japan). The study shows that the limiting factor in keep-
ing up with increased platinum demand is the ability of the industry to respond and
install  additional  production  infrastructure.  Since  in  the  out-years,  recycling  would
provide  almost  60  percent  of  the  supply,  the  industry  will  have  to  be  careful  not  to
overbuild production capacity in a more accelerated market demand scenario.

• Platinum  availability  is  a  strategic  issue  for  the  commercialization  of  hydro-
gen  fuel  cell  vehicles.  Platinum  is  expensive  and  is  currently  critical  to
achieving the required levels of fuel cell power density and efficiency.
As  such,  the  Department  has  been  focused  on  reducing  and  substituting  for
(with non-precious metal catalysts) the amount of platinum in fuel cell stacks
(while  maintaining  performance  and  durability)  so  that  hydrogen  fuel  cells
can be cost competitive with gasoline internal combustion engines.

• Significant  progress  has  been  made  and  is  still  being  made  by  national  lab-
oratories, universities and industry to reduce the amount of platinum needed
in  a  fuel  cell  stack  by  replacing  platinum  catalysts  with  platinum  alloy  cata-
lysts  or  non-platinum  catalysts,  enhancing  the  specific  activity  of  platinum
containing  catalysts,  and  depositing  these  catalysts  on  electrodes  using  inno-
vative  processes.  The  Office  of  Science  has  recently  initiated  new  basic  re-
search  projects  on  the  design  of  catalysts  at  the  nanoscale  that  focus  on  con-
tinued  reduction  in  the  amount  of  platinum  catalyst  required  in  fuel  cell
stacks.

• Typically, it takes three to five years to increase platinum production capacity
in response to an increase in demand. Fuel cell vehicle production may create
a brief platinum supply deficit, leading to short-term price increases.

• The  TIAX  study  shows  that  platinum  prices  over  the  last  one  hundred  years
fluctuated  based  on  major  world  events  (e.g.,  world  war,  etc.);  however,  the
mean  price  (adjusted  for  inflation)  remained  stable  at  $300  per  troy  ounce.
However, over the last couple of years platinum has been higher at $900 per
troy ounce.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Secondly,  where  are  you  going  to  get  all  of  this
energy, if we are at Hubbard’s Peak, and we probably are, with oil
at $60 a barrel and going nowhere but up, I think? Where are you
going to get this energy?

We have got to have a big culture change until we are using less
energy. We are like a young couple that just had a big inheritance
from  their  grandparents,  and  they  have  affected  a  lifestyle  where
85 percent of the money they are spending comes from their grand-
parents’  inheritance,  only  15  percent  from  their  income.  And  their
grandparents’  inheritance  is  not  going  to  last  until  they  die.  Now
they  have  got  to  somehow  transition  themselves  from  this  lavish
lifestyle, living largely on the inheritance from their grandparents.
How  are  we  going  to  do  that,  and  where  are  you  going  to  get  the
energy from from this hydrogen economy?

You  know,  what  we  are  really  doing  is  nibbling  at  the  margins.
We have got to face the fundamental problem that we are at Hub-
bard’s  Peak  and  going  to  start  down  the  other  side  shortly.  Where
are you going to get the energy to come from? What are you telling
people?

Dr. HEYWOOD. May I respond to that one, please?
That is one reason I have talked about these two paths forward,
because  to  make  the  drastic  changes  that—in  culture  lifestyle
economies  that  you  are  really  suggesting,  which  I  think  we  will
have  to  consider,  within  this  century  most  likely,  have  to  make.
That is going to take time.

But in the nearer-term, there are things we can do that are bet-
ter  than  nibbling  at  the  edges.  Yes,  they  have  that  characteristic,
but they will do more. We can—you know, we could half our trans-
portation energy consumption with the sort of technologies that are
almost  ready  today,  but  we  need  to  realize  that  that  is  what  we
will  have  to  do  in  some  way  to  survive  in  the  long-term.  And  I
think that discussion needs to be held much more publicly, and we
have all got to contribute to this and understand the dilemma that
we are facing.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
Before my time runs out, is there something scientifically, inher-
ently  so  much  better  about  a  hydrogen  battery  than  there  is  an
electron  battery  that  we  should  be  pouring  these  billions  of  re-
search into that?

sleep.

Dr. HEYWOOD. The recharge time is one big difference. You could
recharge  a  hydrogen  tank  relatively  quickly  compared  to  recharge
an energy storage battery.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  sleep  all  night.  My  battery  can  charge  while  I

Is there something inherently better about density?
Dr. CRABTREE. May I comment on that?
I  think  the  energy  density  that  you  can  store  in  hydrogen,  as  a
chemical fuel, is higher than you can get from electricity as an elec-
trical fuel——

Mr.  BARTLETT.  But  we  are  still  working  on  that  and  don’t,  in

fact, know, correct?

Dr.  CRABTREE.  If  you  look  at  some  interesting  charts  in  this  re-
port, you will see that hydrogen has the ability to replace your bat-
tery in your laptop and give you three times or four times the run
time for the same weight and the same volume.

Mr. BARTLETT. Good. We ought to be moving——
Dr. CRABTREE. As a matter of fact, it is better.
Mr. BARTLETT. We ought to be moving quickly then.
Thank you.
Dr. BODDE. One final comment, if I may, sir.
You  asked  the  old  what  source  of  energy.  Eventually,  you  get  to
nuclear  and  renewables  that  eventually—this  85  percent  inherit-
ance  is  gone,  no  matter  what  scenario  you  are  in,  an  environ-
mentally  limited  one  or  other,  and  you  are  into  nuclear  for  what-
ever supply you have.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  for  helping  to  get  that  message  out.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Sodrel,

is recognized for five minutes.

Mr. SODREL. Indiana.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Indiana.
Mr. SODREL. Yeah, Indiana.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Excuse me. There is a little difference.
Mr. SODREL. But—well, now we do say ‘‘you all’’ in southern Indi-

ana, and I understand how you could make a mistake.

Going  to  the  question  that  Mr.  Bartlett  framed  about  how  we
produce  hydrogen,  I  understand  the  Icelanders  that—embarked  on
a  robust  program  trying  to  create  hydrogen  using  geothermal  en-
ergy.  Are  any  of  you  familiar  with  what  is  going  on  there?  It  is
kind of a joint industry effort, is it not, where they are—they have
a lot of volcanoes and a lot of heat. And I understand they are try-
ing  to  convert  their  entire  country  to  hydrogen  fuel.  Given  that
their  country  only  has  300,000  population,  it  would  be  a  little  bit
like  us  converting  a  city  to  hydrogen  fuel,  but  do  you  know  how
that is coming along?

No?
Mr. FAULKNER. We can get you details for the record, though, sir,

if you wish.

Mr. SODREL. Yeah, I would appreciate it.

Iceland’s  goal  is  to  become  the  first  nation  in  the  world  to  achieve  the  vision  of
a  hydrogen  economy.  The  move  to  a  hydrogen  economy  has  significant  government
support, and surveys conducted by Icelandic New Energy indicate significant public

support  as  well.  With  a  population  of  less  than  300,000  (the  majority  of  which  re-
sides  in  the  capital  of  Reykjavik),  transforming  the  Icelandic  transportation  sector
to  hydrogen  will  require  far  fewer  hydrogen  fueling  stations  than  what  will  be  re-
quired in the United States. Advances include:

• Iceland  has  an  abundance  of  relatively  inexpensive  renewable  energy  that  is
used  for  heating  and  provides  100  percent  of  the  Nation’s  electricity  (80  per-
cent from hydropower and 20 percent from geothermal).

• Currently,  there  is  one  hydrogen  fueling  station,  located  along  a  major  high-
way  in  Reykjavik,  which  serves  as  a  national  demonstration  project.  Hydro-
gen  is  produced  on  site  via  renewable  electrolysis.  The  station  is  a  publicly
accessible  retail  fueling  station  that  also  offers  gasoline  and  diesel  and  in-
cludes  a  convenience  store.  It  supports  the  operation  of  three  hydrogen  fuel
cell  buses  that  run  regular  routes  around  Reykjavik;  there  are  no  other  hy-
drogen vehicles at this time.

• The next phase of the country’s hydrogen demonstration will involve the con-
version  of  the  entire  Reykjavik  bus  fleet  to  hydrogen.  Future  phases  will  in-
clude promoting the integration of fuel cell powered vehicles for passenger use
and  examining  the  possibility  of  replacing  the  fishing  fleet  with  hydrogen
based vessels.

• Iceland  collaborates  with  the  United  States  through  the  International  Part-
nership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE), which was established in Novem-
ber  2003  to  facilitate  global  collaboration  on  hydrogen  and  fuel  cell  research,
development,  and  demonstration  (RD&D).  With  a  membership  including  16
countries  and  the  European  Commission,  the  IPHE  provides  a  forum  for
leveraging  scarce  RD&D  funds,  harmonizing  codes  and  standards,  and  edu-
cating  stakeholders  and  the  general  public  on  the  benefits  of  and  challenges
to the hydrogen economy.

tiative.

Mr. SODREL. The second question relates to the FreedomCAR ini-

We  have  a  lot  of  foreign  manufacturers  of  automobiles.  I  know
Toyota has an enormous plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. It is kind
of in my neighborhood. Honda, and other foreign automobile manu-
facturers  have  made  significant  investments  in  fuel  cell.  How  do
you feel about greater involvement of foreign car makers that have
domestic  plants  in  this  FreedomCAR  initiative?  Would  it  help
shorten the time frame here or should we ask them to participate?
Dr. BODDE. Well, in my opinion, the world auto industry is truly
a  global  auto  industry,  and  frankly,  it  makes  little  sense,  in  my
opinion,  to  distinguish  between  what  is  domestic  and  what  is  for-
eign. I mean, if you look at the research alliances that are now cre-
ated,  you  see  them  between  General  Motors  and  Toyota.  You  see
them  between  Ford  and  other  foreign  companies.  And  so  these
things  all  kind  of  fit  together  anyway  as  an  international  research
picture.  And  so  I  think  almost  whether  you  do  or  don’t  include
them  in  the  U.S.  program,  that  technology  is  going  to  get  to  them
one  way  or  another,  because  it  is  a  worldwide  technology  institu-
tion.

Mr.  CHERNOBY.  Well,  we  have  had  some  discussion  in  the  U.S.
Car/FreedomCAR  effort  about  including  some  of  our  compatriots
around the world. At this time, we haven’t made any final decisions
on  whether  we  want  to  do  that  or  not,  but  we  absolutely,  in  the
pre-competitive environment, like Dr. Bodde had said, look at what
we  are  doing  around  the  world.  One  of  the  challenges  that  we  do
have,  though,  is  there  isn’t  necessarily  consensus  in  some  of  the
world  governments  on  how  we  ought  to  approach  this  effort,  and
the codes and standards, and the effect, eventually, on not only the
infrastructure of the vehicles that go along with it.

So worldwide harmonization is clearly one of the barriers that we
always  work  on  in  the  auto  industry  and  both  jointly  with  govern-
ment.  And  it  is  likely  to  be  one  here  unless  we  figure  out  a  way
to get it under control.

Mr. SODREL. Thank you. I don’t have any further questions.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman from Indiana.
The gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Gutknecht.
Mr. GUTKNECHT. Ohio.
No, I am from Minnesota.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. It is nice that you care to admit it.
Mr. GUTKNECHT. Listen. First of all, let me offer this disclaimer.
I  am  not  a  scientist.  I  don’t  play  one.  And  we  are  honored  to  have
you scientists here to talk to us.

Those of you who did not hear Roscoe Bartlett’s special order last
night,  I  hope  you  will  all  at  least  get  a  chance,  and  I  hope  Roscoe
will  put  together  a  ‘‘Dear  Colleague’’  to  share  with  the  rest  of  us
some  of  the  interesting  information  he  has  shared  in  his  special
order  last  night  on  the  House  Floor.  It  was  last  night,  wasn’t  it,
Roscoe?

Mr. BARTLETT. Yes.
Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  Okay.  And  what  he  really  said,  and  I  will  just
extend his remarks a bit here, was he said that energy is so cheap
today,  and  he  had  some—in  fact,  I  would  yield  to  the  gentleman
a  minute,  if  he  wants,  to  share  some  of  the  examples  of  just  how
cheap energy really is.

Mr. BARTLETT. Oh, thank you very much.
A  barrel  of  oil  is  about  $60  today.  And  you  can  buy  the  refined
product  of  that  for  about  $100  at  the  pump,  42  gallons  of  gas,  $2
and something a gallon, right? That will buy you the work equiva-
lent of 12 people working all year for you. That is the work output
you  are  buying  from  $100  worth  of  gasoline.  If  you  go  out  this
weekend  and  work  really  hard  all  day,  I  will  get  more  mechanical
work  done  with  an  electric  motor  with  less  than  25  cents  worth  of
electricity.  That  is  what  you  are  worth,  in  terms  of  mechanical
work: less than 25 cents a day.

This—these  fossil  fuels  are  so  darn  cheap.  We  are  just  as  as-
suredly  addicted  to  them  as  a  cocaine  addict  is  to  his  drug.  It  has
become a drug for us.

Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  Well,  reclaiming  my  time,  and  I—those  were
just some of the remarks he made last night, and I thought it was
fascinating. And it really sort of underscores the importance of this
meeting,  but  it  also—I  think  we  need  to  look  at  this  whole  energy
thing  in  that  context,  that  fossil  fuel  energy  is  incredibly  cheap,
even  at  $60  a  barrel.  Somebody  figured  it  out,  we  still  pay  four
times  more  for  a  gallon  of  water  in  a  convenience  store  than  we
pay for that gallon of gasoline, even at $60 a barrel. And I am not
defending  the  oil  companies  or  the  oil  barons  that  have  us  ‘‘over
the barrel,’’ no pun intended.

I  want  to  come  back  to—and  I  was  particularly  interested  in
some  of  the  comments  by  Dr.  Heywood,  because  I  think  that,  in
some  respects,  you  nailed  it,  that—I  am  a  believer  in  doing  all  we
can to advance the science relative to hydrogen power and some of
these  other  things,  but  I  have  come  to  the  conclusion,  at  least,
again, as a layman, that hydrogen is, in some respects, a very, very

good  battery,  but  I  think  we  have  to—we  don’t  want  to  oversell  it
long-term,  in  terms  of  its  value  as  an  energy  source.  And  I  am  in-
terested in some of the other technology.

And  maybe,  Dr.  Faulkner,  you  could  comment  on  this,  because
I know there are some people—there are people who have come in
to  see  me,  and  again,  I  am  not  a  scientist.  I  don’t  play  one  here
in  the  Congress,  but  I  am  just  a  curious  guy.  One  of  the  tech-
nologies  that  people  have  talked  to  me  about  are  super  magnets.
Are  any  of  you  doing  any  work  with  super  magnets?  And  do  you
know what I am talking about?

All  right.  We  will  have  them  come  and  talk  to  you,  because  I
found  it  fascinating  that  we  now  have—well,  I  will  go  on  to  a  dif-
ferent subject.

INSERT FOR THE RECORD BY DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

The term ‘‘Super magnets’’ is a broad description for several families of rare Earth
magnets.  I  am  not  aware  of  any  DOE  work  in  the  area  of  super  magnets.  Super-
conducting  magnets,  on  the  other  hand,  are  electromagnets,  which  use  an  electric
current  to  generate  a  magnetic  field,  and  the  electricity  runs  through  super-
conducting materials, such that very large magnetic fields can be generated without
electrical  resistance  creating  large  amounts  of  waste  heat.  The  Department’s  Office
of Science uses superconducting magnets in some of its particle accelerators.

Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  And  that  subject  is  really  about  renewable
fuels,  because  on  the  other  Committee  that  I  serve  on,  the  House
Agriculture  Committee,  I  chair  a  Subcommittee,  and  we  have  re-
sponsibility  for  some  of  the  renewable  fuel  programs.  And  there
again,  there  are  some  amazing  things  happening,  sometimes  with-
out  any  oversight  responsibility  or  funding  from  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment in terms of producing this fuel even cheaper.

Just out of curiosity, how many of you know right now how much
it  costs  at  a—one  of  our  more  advanced  ethanol  plants  to  produce
a  gallon  of  ethanol?  What  would  the  cost  be?  What  would  you
guess?

Dr. Faulkner.
Mr. FAULKNER. Well, about $2.10.
Mr. GUTKNECHT. Next?
Dr.  BODDE.  I  would  have  to  look  that  one  up  for  you,  but  I  go

with his number in the absence of anything else.

Mr. GUTKNECHT. All right.
Mr. CHERNOBY. I would have been more in the $3 realm.
Mr. GUTKNECHT. Okay.
Dr. HEYWOOD. I would add that those costs depend on where you
draw your boundary and what costs that add up to that figure are
included.  There  is  a  lot  of  variability  in  studies  of  producing  eth-
anol  and  the  reality,  and  it  depends  how  the  numbers  are  worked
out.

Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  Well,  let  us  do  simple  arithmetic.  You  have  to
buy  the  corn,  right?  It  is  about  $2.20  a  bushel  right  now.  And  you
have  to  amortize  the  cost  of  the  plant,  right?  The  biggest  cost  in
producing ethanol right now is in energy. I mean, you have to cook
the  corn.  But  according  to  my  most  efficient  plants  in  my  District,
right  now,  at  $2.20  a  bushel  of  corn,  and  we  have  to  assume  the
cost of producing that corn, and believe it or not, maybe even a lit-
tle  profit  for  the  guy  who  grows  it  is  in  that  $2.20,  the  answer  is,
and  not  only  from  my  ethanol  plants,  but  also  according  to  the

Chief  Economist  at  USDA,  the  answer  is  95  cents  a  gallon.  Does
that surprise you? It surprises most Americans. And I say that, be-
cause right now, in both the pure cost basis and in terms of BTUs,
ethanol is cheaper than gasoline.

I yield back my time.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The gentleman from California, Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much.
I  am  from  California.  I  am  very  proud  of  being  from  California.
I  would  just  like  to  get  down  to  some  fundamentals,  and  first  of
all,  let  me  suggest  that  Roscoe  Bartlett  adds  a  great  deal  to  every
hearing that I go to, and I am happy to have him with us and mak-
ing his contributions.

Let  us—I  would  like  to  ask—go  back  to  the  cost  of  hydrogen.
From what I take it, after the exchange between you folks and Ros-
coe,  is  that  there  actually  isn’t  an  energy  savings  reasons  to  go  to
hydrogen  as  a  fuel,  because  it  actually  would  use  more  energy  to
create  it  than  what  you  get  out  of  it  once  it  is  actually  manufac-
tured, is that correct? So we are actually—the hydrogen fuel angle
is  that  it  will—it  is  a  cleaner  burning  fuel  for  the  air,  is  that  why
we want to go in that direction?

Mr. BARTLETT. If the gentleman would yield for a quick moment.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes.
Mr. BARTLETT. It is true that it takes more energy to produce hy-
drogen  than  what  you  get  out  of  it.  When  you  use  hydrogen,  you
can  conveniently  use  it  in  a  fuel  cell  that  gets  at  least  twice  the
efficiency of the reciprocating engine. So at the end of the day, you
may  use  less  energy,  in  spite  of  the  energy  loss.  We  are  not  going
to suspend the second——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Mr. BARTLETT.—law of thermodynamics. In spite of that loss, we

may end up using less energy with hydrogen.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  would  it  depend  on,  as  Roscoe  is  sug-
gesting,  that  we—that  the  development  of  fuel  cell  type  engines
rather  than  the  current  type  of  engines  that  we  have  in  auto-
mobiles?

Dr. BODDE. Well, both are certainly true. You do need a fuel cell,
of course, to offset the inefficiencies in producing the hydrogen. But
on the other hand, anything that you manufacture is subject to the
second law. And so there is always an increase in entropy or a de-
grading of the energy source, no matter—from any human activity.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  I  have—actually,  I  have  been  told—we
just  had  a  briefing  the  other  day  on  biodiesel  that  suggested  that
that  is  not  the  case  with  biodiesel,  with  canola  oil,  that  actually
you  get  more  BTUs  out  of—there  are  more  BTUs  left  over  by  the
process  by  a  three  to  one  margin  than  it  takes  to  actually  produce
the biodiesel.

Dr. BODDE. As Dr. Heywood said, it depends where you draw the

boundaries around the system.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But none of you have heard that that is—you
think that is an inaccurate statement if it is—when the boundaries
are drawn the same around hydrogen as around biodiesel?

77

Dr.  BODDE.  I  don’t  know  the  specifics  of  that  particular  one,  sir,
but I would be suspicious of anything that appears to create energy
out of nothing. That energy always comes from some place.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Yeah,  well,  we  know  that  solar—as  my  col-
league  is  suggesting,  that  the  plants  are  actually  taking  in  solar
energy, and that is part of the process that nature has provided us,
and that is the explanation of where extra energy could come from.
And do any of you have anything else to say about the—comparing
a  biodiesel  approach  to  a  hydrogen  approach  in  terms  of  the  cost
of energy in creating your final product?

Dr. HEYWOOD. Let me comment on that.
One  advantage  of  hydrogen,  and  I  think  it  is  real,  is  that  it  has
no  carbon.  So  it  is  analogous  to  a  gasoline  or  diesel  fuel.  You  can
put  it  in  the  tank  of  a  vehicle.  And  when  it  is  used  to  drive  the
vehicle,  there  is  no  carbon  dioxide,  no  greenhouse  gases,  emitted,
so that is one of its important advantages.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Right.  I  think  that  is  an  advantage  with  the
biodiesel as well. Is—does biodiesel create greenhouse gases? I——

Dr. HEYWOOD. Well, that——
Mr. FAULKNER. It might be a net zero, but——
Dr. HEYWOOD. That depends on the details.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Right,  because  the  plants  absorb  a  certain

amount of the——

Dr. HEYWOOD. And I would add that this may well not be an ei-
ther  or,  because  we  talked  primarily  about  passenger  vehicles,  but
the  freight  part  of  our  transportation  system  is  very  significant  in
terms of its energy consumption. And the big piece is the long-haul
trucks,  which  use  diesel  engines.  They  are  very  efficient  engines,
and  there  is  nothing  on  the  horizon  that  looks  like  it  could  chal-
lenge them, in terms of efficiency.

So  sources  of  fuel  for  diesel  engines  in—of  the  long-term  future,

is something we should be looking at and——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Dr.  HEYWOOD.—exploring  and  developing,  and  biodiesel  is  one

option.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, it is—if you have to reconfigure the en-
gine  of  every  car  that  is  manufactured  in  order  to  take  hydrogen
in  a  way  that  is  efficient,  meaning  you  have  to  end  up  with  a  fuel
cell  engine  rather  than  the  engines  that  we  have,  it  is  enormous
costs  in  terms  of  transition.  So  we  would  want  to  make  sure  the
end  result  was  taking  care  of  the  fundamental  problem,  which  is
running out of energy.

Let me ask you about the hydrogen engine.
Now  someone  told  me  that  a  byproduct  of  a  hydrogen  engine  or
a fuel cell is water, and—pure water, but would this not be a prob-
lem  in  areas  like  in  half  of  the  United  States  where  it  freezes  in
the  wintertime?  Would  this  not  be  a—some  kind  of  a  problem  to
have water coming out of the engine?

Mr. CHERNOBY. Well, actually—I will comment.
That  has  been  one  of  the  challenges  that  we  have  been  working
on,  not  just  water  coming  out  of  the  engine,  but  water  within  the
fuel cell itself. What you will find, during the process of converting
the  hydrogen  to  electricity  in  the  fuel  cell,  there  is  quite  a  bit  of
heat that is generated to warm the water up. And the challenge we

78

have  been  working  on,  I  think,  we—not  only  DaimlerChrysler,  but
other  OEMs  as  well,  have  found  ways  to  overcome  is  how  do  we
manage  that  water  within  the  fuel  cell  during  that  initial  start-up
stage when that heat is in there.

So  clearly,  you  are  absolutely  right.  The  challenge  of  that  water
being there in a cold environment is something that has to be man-
aged.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. We have not—that particular hurdle has not

been jumped over yet.

Mr.  CHERNOBY.  We  have  made  exceptional  progress  in  the  last

12 months. I won’t say we are done.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  Because  I  can’t  imagine—I  can—com-
ing  from  California,  as  I  do,  we  wouldn’t  mind  having,  I  guess,
more  water  on  our  roads,  but  if  it  froze,  if  we  lived  in  Minnesota,
as  my  friend  here  does,  I  would  imagine  that  a  significant  part  of
the  year,  the  last  thing  you  want  to  have  is  water  spread  on  the
road  and  having  to  drive  your  car  or  have  to  rely  on  the  road  for
transportation.

So this is a significant—it seems to me that that would be a sig-

nificant problem.

Thank you very much, Madame Chairman.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The gentleman yields back.
The gentleman from Texas, Mr. McCaul.
Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you, Madame Chairman.
I am a member of the hydrogen fuel cell caucus, and we were in-
troduced to a hydrogen fuel cell car, and I was able to drive it. And
it  was  a  great  experience,  but  I  asked  them  how  much  it  cost  to
build  them—and  we  obviously  have  the  technology  today  to  do  it,
but I asked how much did it cost to build this, and the answer was
$1 million for the car.

That is obviously the issue here, bringing the cost down.
The  energy  companies  in  my  district,  when  I  talk  to  them  about
this  issue,  and  I  am  very  interested  in  it,  they  tell  me  that  the
timeline  is  20  to  30  years  out  in  the  future.  I  don’t  want  to  accept
that answer, and I wanted to get your response to that.

And  in  addition,  I  wanted  to  ask  the  question  or  possibly  get  a
comment  on  the  energy  bill  that  we  hope  is  going  to  come  out  of
conference  committee.  There  will  be  approximately  $2  billion  ap-
propriated  for  alternative  energy,  including  hydrogen.  And  where
would  you  think—where  would  you  direct  that  money  if  you  were
king for a day and could call the shots on that?

And then finally, the role of the universities, I have a university
in my District, and in my view, I think the universities have a role
to play with respect to developing these alternative energies.

I will just open it up to the panel.
Dr. HEYWOOD. Let me comment on the time scales.
It is important that we say—or sort out time scale to what. And
we  have  got  fuel  cell  cars  out  already.  There  will  be  larger  fleets
10  or  15  years  from  now.  The  DOE  commercialization  decision  is
pitched  for  2015,  10  years  from  now.  Our  judgment  was  that  fuel
cells—we  will  know  whether  they  are  marketable  within  about  15
years. That is not all that different.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:02 Jan 27, 2006 Jkt 022549 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\072005\22549.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

79

But then there is this time scale to build up production. And we
have  never  gone  through  a  large-scale  change  in  a  propulsion  sys-
tem,  except  for  the  diesel  transition  in  Europe.  Diesels  took  over
from 10 percent of the market in Europe in 1980 to 50 percent now.
So  it  took  25  years.  Diesels,  a  well-established  technology,  to  go
from small scale to 50 percent of the market. How long will it take
fuel cells? That is where we get to 20, 30, 40 years before there are
enough fuel cells to have an impact on our energy consumption.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  So  the  energy  companies  are—they  are  accurate

when they say that?

Dr. HEYWOOD. They are right.
Mr. MCCAUL. Okay.
Dr. CRABTREE. May I comment?
The last two parts of your question about where should the fund-

ing go and what—and the role of universities.

I believe that there is an enormous amount of basic research that
needs  to  be  done,  and  the  best  place—one  of  the  best  places  to  do
that  is  universities.  Universities  and  national  labs  working  to-
gether can actually accomplish that goal.

When  you  have  $2  billion  to  spend,  you—it  actually  isn’t  a  lot  if
only  a  fraction  of  it  goes  to  hydrogen.  You  have  to  be  careful  with
how you spend it, and I think there needs to be a balance. So there
should  be  a  balance  between  helping  industry  do  the  research,  as
many  of  the  companies  do,  and  universities  and  national  labs.  I
think these are the three places it should go——

Mr. MCCAUL. Good.
Dr. CRABTREE.—with very carefully targeted goals.
Dr.  BODDE.  Let  me  offer  a  comment,  also,  sir,  if  I  may,  on  the

role of the universities.

I  think  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  universities  are  fun-
damentally ‘‘people factories.’’ That is, their basic product is people.
And turning out people who are not only capable in the technology,
but  capable  innovators  is  probably  a  very  primary  thing  and  prob-
ably one that may have been underappreciated in the university for
a number of years.

Beyond  that,  of  course,  is  the  basic  research,  the  blue  sky  re-
search. But I think there is an emerging role for universities, also,
as  innovation  centers,  as  centers  not  only  for  the  creation  of  new
technology ideas, but the capturing of those—of the economic value
in those ideas, because as we look at competitive worldwide indus-
tries,  we  are  beginning  to  see  increasing  pressures  on  the  central
R&D  functions  in  virtually  every  company.  And  if  that  is  to  hap-
pen, if that translating function is to happen, then it has got to go
someplace, and I believe the universities can emerge and play some
role, not the only role, of course, but an increasing role in that.

Mr. FAULKNER. A couple of comments, sir.
Universities are a key partner for my office across the board, and
they  are  for  this  hydrogen  initiative.  I  mentioned  in  my  oral  testi-
mony  that  we  have  three  Centers  of  Excellence  we  have  initiated.
They include 20 universities just in that alone.

On  the  cost,  I  think  one  thing  to  mention  is,  yes,  there  aren’t
that  many  cars  on  the  road,  so  just  like  anything  else,  the  prices
are high. The more you make, the more the costs come down.

80

One  thing  we  have  started  to  look  at,  and  I  mentioned  this  in
my  oral  testimony,  I  think  this  is  an  exciting  field,  is  manufac-
turing R&D. I think we need to look more at this and other renew-
able areas, too, but to look at how to take things in the laboratory
out into the plant floor or the factory floor and move it on out into
commercialization.  And  we  are  going  to  be  looking  more  and  more
at  that  in  the  years  ahead.  This  is  a  spin-off  of  the  President’s
manufacturing  initiative.  And  we  are  looking  at  things  like  high-
volume  manufacturing,  standardizing  components,  developing  an
infrastructure,  developing  a  supplier  base.  And  this  is  going  to  be
a critical factor in helping to bring those costs down as you manu-
facture the hydrogen initiative.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  If  I  could  ask  one  more  question,  Madame  Chair.
Twenty  to  thirty  years  to  have  market  saturation,  but  when  do
we  think  the  first  hydrogen  cars  will  actually  be  out  on  the  mar-
ket?

Mr.  CHERNOBY.  Well,  again,  it  gets  back  to  your  time  question.
I  don’t  find  it  so  easy  to  actually  put  a  specific  date  on  the  inven-
tion of technology and research. If we had that kind of crystal ball,
I  think  we  would  be  in  a  lot  better  shape.  But  we  look  forward  to
vehicles,  and  then  when  you  say  ready,  it  depends  upon,  again,  at
what  value  for  the  customer  and  what  price  point.  But  during
the—this  next  decade 
expect,  at
DaimlerChrysler,  we  ought  to  have  that  commercial  vehicle  viable
for the marketplace, from a technical perspective.

is  when  we  would 

But  it  is  only  as  good  as  having  available  the  infrastructure.  I
thought the ethanol discussion was very interesting. We have built
millions of vehicles capable of running on ethanol, and they are out
there  in  the  marketplace  today.  But  yet  it  shows  you  that  unless
you have got market pull and market incentive, it doesn’t all come
together to benefit either the environment or energy security.

Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you, Madame Chair.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
I  think  we  have  time  for  a  few  more  questions,  if  everybody  is

very brief asking the question and answering the question.

So Chairman Inglis, would you like to go ahead for five minutes?
Thank you.
Chairman INGLIS. I thank you.
Mr.  Chernoby,  I  understand  that  you  have  some  dealings  with
the—with  codes  and  standards  tech  team.  And  one  of  the  signifi-
cant  roles  of  the  Federal  Government  or  government  somewhere
may  be  the  setting  of  codes  and  standards,  especially  for  the  stor-
age of hydrogen. Do you want to comment on any suggestions that
you  have  for  us  at  the  federal  level  or  what  should  be  our  ap-
proach?  It  is  a  little  bit  early,  I  know,  to—maybe  to  project  those,
but  suggestions  from  you  about  how  to  approach  codes  and  stand-
ards.

Mr. CHERNOBY. I would give you three key suggestions.
Number one, don’t try to move to locking down a code or a stand-
ard  too  early  while  technology  is  still  in  the  evolutionary  stage.
When  technology  starts  to  settle  down,  then,  in  a  pre-competitive
environment,  we  can  all  work  together,  both  industry  and  govern-
ment, to set the right standards.

So number one, don’t move too quickly.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:02 Jan 27, 2006 Jkt 022549 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\072005\22549.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

81

Number  two,  as  you  already  do  in  a  very  proactive  mode,  work
with  us.  We  will  all  work  together  to  try  to  find  the  right  balance
to make sure that every standard we issue is going to be viable in
the  marketplace  and  provide  everything  it  has  got  to  do,  whether
it be safety for the consumer right on down to the various environ-
mental benefits we might need.

And  then  finally,  we  have  got  to  work  together  to  keep  an  eye
on  the  global  codes  and  standards.  And  I  know  the  government  is
already participating in some harmonization community—or collec-
tive  efforts  around  the  world.  We  have  got  to  do  our  best,  as  we
try and develop these codes and standards, that they are very simi-
lar so that we can gain volumes of scale, bring the costs down, and
make the vehicles viable in the marketplace.

Chairman  INGLIS.  With  these  test  vehicles  that  have  been  men-
tioned  that  we  are  driving  around,  have  there  been  any  local  fire
chiefs  in  various  cities  that  have  said,  ‘‘Not  in  our  city,’’  or  any-
thing  like  that,  I  mean,  such  that  we  are  already  seeing  some  dis-
crepancies in the standards?

Mr.  CHERNOBY.  I  wouldn’t  say  in  those  terms,  but  there  have
been  local  fire  chiefs  that  have  raised  their  hand  and  said,  ‘‘Come
talk  to  me.  We  would  like  to  have  some  input.  We  would  like  to
work  with  you.’’  And  that  is  virtually  in  almost  every  state  where
we  are  participating  today.  So  we  absolutely  welcome  and—that
type  of  conversation  effort,  so  we  are  collectively  working  together
to find the rest—the best answer.

Chairman  INGLIS.  Anybody  else  want  to  comment  on  that?  The

codes and standards?

Thank you, Madame Chair.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
We  will—I  think  we  will  skip  over,  if  you  don’t  mind,  Dr.  Bart-
lett,  to  Mr.  Schwarz  from  Michigan,  who  just  arrived  for  his  first
round.

Mr. SCHWARZ. Thank you, but I have no questions.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Oh, well, then we won’t.
Mr. Bartlett is recognized.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
Let me take just a moment to define, for those who are listening
or  those  who  may  be  reading  this  testimony,  what  we  mean  by
‘‘Hubbard’s Peak.’’ This resulted from the work of a geologist work-
ing  for  the  Shell  Oil  Company  back  in  the  1940s  and  1950s  who
noticed  the  exploitation  and  exhaustion  of  oil  fields  that  tended  to
follow a bell curve, increasing production to a peak and then falling
off  as  you  pull  the  last  oil  out  of  the  field.  He—in  estimating  the
fields  yet  to  be  found  and  adding  those  to  the  fields  he  knew  were
in  existence  for  the  United  States,  he  predicted,  in  1956,  that  the
United States would peak in oil production in about 1970. His pre-
diction  turned  out  to  be  exactly  right.  Every  year  since  1970,  we
have not only found less oil, we have pumped less oil.

Using his analysis techniques, he predicted that the world would
peak  at  about  2000.  That  slipped  a  little  because  of  the  Arab  oil
embargo,  oil  price  spike  hikes,  and  a  worldwide  recession.  And
there are many insiders who believe that we are now at Hubbard’s
Peak.

82

And so Hubbard’s Peak represents the peak oil production in the
world, and it is only downhill after that. A plateau for a while, and
then downhill after that.

I would just like to caution and get your comment on it, that we
shouldn’t  be  too  optimistic  about  the  energy  we  are  going  to  get
from  agriculture.  Tonight,  20  percent  of  the  world  will  go  to  bed
hungry. Until we learned to do no-till cropping, we were losing the
battle  with  maintaining  our  topsoil.  It  was  ending  up  in  our  bays,
and  from  the  whole  central  part  of  our  country,  to  the  Mississippi
delta.  If—to  get  a  lot  of  energy  from  agriculture,  we  are  either
going  to  have  to  eat  the  corn  that  we  would  have  fed  to  the  pig,
we  are  going  to  have  to  live  lower  on  the  food  scale,  because  you
can’t  feed  the  corn  to  the  pig  and  then  eat  the  pig,  because  there
is an awful—that is a very poor energy transfer, by the way, when
you are doing that.

Also, if we are going to take a lot of the biomass off, I have some
real  concern  about  our  ability  to  maintain  topsoil.  As  I  said,  until
we learned to do no-till farming, we were losing that battle. We are
just  now  barely  able  to  hold  the  quality  of  our  topsoil  with  no-till
farming.  If  we  are  raping  the  soil  of  a  lot  of  this  organic  material,
the  tills  will  deteriorate,  the  soil  will  have  no  acceptable  tills,  and
we  are—you  know,  it  is  going  to  become  a  mud  pit  when  it  is  wet
and  a  brick  when  it  is  dry.  That  is  how  you  make  brick.  You  take
soil that has no humus in it and put it in an oven and bake it.

Do  you  share  some  concerns  about  the  potential  for  getting  en-

ergy from agriculture in the long haul?

Dr. HEYWOOD. Let me respond.
Yes,  I  do.  There  is  a  question  what—how  big  a  contribution  we

think it might be able to make.

There  are  several  questions.  One  is  how  big  a  contribution,  and
the other is exactly what you have just talked about, what are the
long-term environmental impacts of monocultures grown on a large
scale to produce fuel.

And  I  have  a  Ph.D.  student  who  is  working  on  a  project  that  is
focused  exactly  on  that,  because  there  is  very—there  is  not  a  lot
of prior work that looks at these longer-term impacts. And what we
have found so far is that people’s predictions on these impacts vary
a lot. So there really is a need to dig into that question and under-
stand it better.

But  even  if  biofuels  contribute  five  percent  or  10  percent  to  our
liquid transportation fuel system, that is—it is not easy to find five
and 10 percent. So that might be an important five and 10 percent.
Mr. FAULKNER. I believe, sir, a quick answer for me is I am more
sanguine than you might be on that subject. I would note that the
Department of Energy and Agriculture just recently published a re-
port  that  we  internally  call  ‘‘The  Billion  Ton  Study.’’  That  is  over
a  billion  tons  of  forest  material  and  agricultural  material,  that  is
not just the corn kernel. There is starch. It is also waste material,
like  corn  stalks  and  sugar  cane  gas,  are  available—or  could  be
available  in  the  future  to  produce  biofuels,  products,  and  power,
and  I  think  that  is  a  study  I  would  like  to  get  to  you,  if  that  is
okay.

INSERT FOR THE RECORD BY DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

In April 2005, the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture published the fol-
lowing  report  assessing  the  potential  of  the  land  resources  in  the  United  States  for
producing  sustainable  biomass:  Biomass  as  Feedstock  for  a  Bioenergy  and  Bioprod-
ucts Industry: The Technical Feasibility of a Billion-Ton Annual Supply. This study
indicates  that  a  billion  tons  of  biomass  supply  consisting  of  renewable  resources
from both agricultural and forestry supplies could be utilized in an environmentally
and  economically  sustainable  manner.  According  to  the  report,  these  resources  are
capable  of  supplying  more  than  30  percent  of  the  Nation’s  present  petroleum  con-
sumption  and  include  agricultural  residues  such  as  corn  stalks  and  sugarcane  ba-
gasse. Presently, the Department is supporting the Department of Agriculture in its
efforts to determine how much of the residue can be removed without reducing soil
fertility and depressing grain yields in subsequent years after residue removal.

[The report appears in Appendix 2: Additional Material for the Record.]
Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. Secretary, I am not sure we—it is appropriate
to  call  these  things  ‘‘waste  material.’’  Anything  that  goes  back  to
the soil to maintain the health of the soil, putting organic material
back  into  the  soil,  that  is  really  not  a  ‘‘waste  material.’’  For  one
year, you may see it as ‘‘waste material,’’ but if you keep doing that
for a long time, I have some concern about what is going to happen
to our topsoil and our ability to grow these crops.

Dr. CRABTREE. May I make one comment on your question about

where the energy will come from after Hubbard’s Peak?

It is just one statistic, you might be interested, one fact. The sun
gives,  in  one  hour,  more  energy  to  the  Earth  than  we  use  in  one
year, so there is an enormous resource in solar energy, if we knew
how to tap it, that would, indeed, supply our needs.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you.  I  am  a  big  solar  enthusiast.  I  have
a place in West Virginia off the grid, and we produce all of our elec-
tricity, so I will tell you that you have to be pretty sparing in your
use  of  electricity.  And  we  have  a  number  of  panels.  You  are  going
to  have  to  have  a  very  different  lifestyle  when  you  can’t  use  your
grandparents’  inheritance  anymore,  you  have  to  live  on  your  15
percent income.

Dr.  BODDE.  With  that  said,  sir,  I  think  we  are  just  beginning  to
see  the  effects  of  energy  conservation,  or  efficient  energy  use,  I
guess  I  should  say,  and  as  energy  prices  rise,  as  engineers  begin
to  look  at  the  services  that  energy  provides,  as  opposed  to  the  en-
ergy  itself,  I  think  there  is  huge  potential  for  that  to  relieve  some
of  this  problem  already.  Will  it  relieve  the  whole  thing?  No,  of
course not. But as Dr. Heywood said, five or 10 percent is not bad.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  Just  one  comment,  Madame  Chairman.  Thank

you for the time.

We  better  do  that,  sir,  or  we  are  going  to  have  no  energy  to  in-
vest  in  the  alternatives  that  we  must  transition  to.  Today,  we  are
using all of our energy, just barely able, at $60 a barrel, to produce
enough  to  keep  our  economies  going.  We  have  no  energy  to  invest,
essentially  none  to  invest.  We  have  to  make  big  investments  of
time  and  energy  if  we  are  going  to  transition.  And  we  will  transi-
tion,  by  the  way.  We  will  either  do  it  on  our  course  or  at  nature’s
course.  But  we  will  transition  from  fossil  fuels  to  renewables.  The
question is, how bumpy will that ride be?

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
The gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank  you  very  much,  Madame  Chairperson.

This is a very important hearing.

While  you  gentlemen  are  sitting  there,  conferees  are  meeting  on
the  massive  energy  policy  bill,  and  I  would  venture  to  say  that  al-
though the Science Committee and the previous speaker and others
worked their heart out, the predominance of the bill obviously deal
with fossil fuel.

But  the  Science  Committee  did  have  its  voice,  and  I  am  pleased
to  note  that  there  were  a  number  of  options  and  alternatives  and
excellent additions to the legislation per this committee.

I am also pleased to note, as I understand it, Mr. Faulkner, that
we have added $33 million in fiscal year 2006 regarding the hydro-
gen  program.  I  hope  that  is  accurate,  and  you  might  comment  in
my questions.

Let me just say that I come from Texas, so I come from oil coun-
try.  And  in  fact,  one  of  my  amendments  in  the  bill  spoke  to  deter-
mining  the  extent  of  deposits  off  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  so  that  we
could  plan  long  range  in  a  more  organized  manner  what  we  had
at  our  access,  if  we  will,  particularly  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the
greater  exploration  is  probably  more  off  the  Louisiana  and  Texas
coasts  than  it  might  be  off  of  Texas—off  of  California  and  Florida.
So  there  are  some  concerns  about  energy  resources,  particularly
oil and gas, even though there are those of us who live in that envi-
ronment  and  certainly  support  that  environment  in  a  safe  and
healthy way, we are also open-minded to recognize that the United
States has to have options.

And  so  I  pose  these  questions  with  the  backdrop  of  the  develop-
ment  that  is  going  on  off  the  shores  of  Louisiana  and  Mexico  and
also  international  oil  development  and  the  new  findings  on  LNG.
There are options that I think that we should be involved in.

I will pose two questions, keeping that in mind, and a sub-ques-

tion.

One, it may have been asked, but I am interested in the proposed
sources  for  hydrogen,  particularly  the  options  include  nuclear  and
natural  gas,  clean  coal,  wind,  and  renewables.  And  I  would  be  in-
terested from all of you as to what shows the most promise.

Then we have done some work in the Science Committee on fuel
cells.  And  in  fact,  we  had  some  amendments  along  those  lines  in
the  energy  bill.  Fuel  cells  and  fuel  production  are  experiencing
competitive  pressures  significant  enough  to  affect  pricing,  is  my
question,  is  the  market  in  fuel  cells,  if  that  pressure  is  affecting
pricing?  And  if  it  is  not,  when  will  we  see  a  truly  competitive  fuel
cell  market?  And  what  drives  down  prices  and  advances  tech-
nology?

Mr. Chernoby, in your remarks, I would be interested in whether
you have hybrid cars already, using hydrogen or other alternatives.
And  then  for  all  of  you  to  answer  the  question  of  the  great  need
to  educate  more  scientists  and  engineers,  which  is  an  issue  that  I
have worked on on this committee. I am frightened by the prospect
that we may not have a farm team of physicists and chemists, engi-
neers, and I have worked to help finance the historically black col-
leges  and  Hispanic-serving  colleges  and  community  colleges.  But  I
welcome  your  comments  on  what  we  could  do  on  expanding  that
area.

And I yield to the gentlemen.
I  ask,  also,  that  my  remarks  may  be  submitted  into  the  record.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Without objection.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Faulkner, would you start, please? And is
that  $33  million  accurate?  Do  you  know?  Or  have  we  given  you
more?

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Yes,  ma’am.  The  President  announced  an  initia-
tive for $1.2 billion over five years. We are on track for that initia-
tive. I was looking at the chart in front of me. Fiscal year 2005 ap-
propriations  for  the  whole  initiative,  which  includes  my  office,  the
Nuclear  Office,  Fossil  Office,  Science,  and  also  the  Department  of
Transportation,  appropriations  for  fiscal  year  2005,  was,  roughly,
$225  million.  Our  presidential  request  for  that  same  group  is
roughly $260 million.
You mentioned——
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  And  you  are  getting  more  money  for  hydro-

gen? That is what I was asking. You don’t have that——

Mr.  FAULKNER.  Well,  this  is  the  hydrogen  fuel  initiative.  It  is

fuel cells, hydrogen production——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Mr. FAULKNER. You asked several other questions. I will provide
answers  for  a  couple  of  those,  and  my  colleagues  will  probably  fill
in others.

You asked what shows the most promise for sources of hydrogen.
I  think,  right  now,  it  is  too  early  to  say.  We  are  pursuing  several
different pathways. We are still early in this initiative, and I would
hate  to  cut  off  promising  research  and  development  by  picking  a
winner or a loser this early in the game.

You talked about scientists and engineers, and I would just note
that we have an initiative that I personally am very fond of in our
office  with  the  National  Association  for  State  Universities  and
Land  Grant  Colleges  that  we  have  been  working  on  with  them  for
the last couple of years. It’s not directly related to the hydrogen ini-
tiative, but we think there is a lot of excitement here, and we share
your  interest  in  building  these—growing  more  scientists—the  sci-
entists  and  engineers  in  America.  And  if  you  would  like,  we  could
give  you  more  information  on  that,  and  that  does  include  histori-
cally black colleges you mentioned.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. I would. Thank you.

INSERT FOR THE RECORD BY DOUGLAS L. FAULKNER

Since 2004, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Re-
newable  Energy  (EERE)  and  the  National  Association  of  State  Universities  and
Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) have been building a partnership to improve com-
munication  between  the  two  scientific  communities,  advance  the  development  and
use  of  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  technologies,  and  educate  the  young  sci-
entists and engineers that America needs for securing our energy future.

For  EERE,  the  217  NASULGC  institutions  of  higher  education,  which  include  18
historically  black  institutions  and  33  American  Indian  land-grant  colleges,  provide
an  opportunity  for  focusing  research,  extension/outreach,  and  curriculum  develop-
ment  activities  on  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  issues.  EERE  can  use
NASULGC’s Cooperative Extension and Outreach networks to improve the dissemi-
nation of results coming from university researchers and DOE research laboratories,
and  to  spread  the  use  and  adoption  of  energy-saving  and  renewable  energy  tech-
nologies and products for residential, commercial, and other sectors.

For  NASULGC  affiliated  institutions,  the  outcome  is  to  develop  relevant  cur-
riculum, research, and outreach programs with EERE’s latest technologies that will
assist their students and the citizens of their state. NASULGC can work with EERE
to help its member institutions increase their responsiveness to practical issues and

provide opportunities for faculty and students to gain access to research and cutting
edge knowledge.

EERE  and  NASULGC  are  working  together  to  assist  young  people’s  under-
standing  and  appreciation  for  math  and  science  through  a  hands-on  learning  pro-
gram with 4–H kids. Young participants apply physics, mathematics, and other dis-
ciplines  to  lighting  and  other  energy  technologies.  Energy  efficiency  and  renewable
education programs are also being delivered to youth and adults.

Dr.  BODDE.  One  comment,  if  I  may,  on  the  colleges  and  colleges

as ‘‘people factories,’’ in particular.

I  think  that  is  very  important  to  the  economic  growth  and  the

scientific growth of this country.

One of the things, though, that I think that research universities
have to do is learn to become more effective partners with technical
colleges  to  allow  an  effective  transition  and  effective  unified  pro-
gram  between  them.  That  is  one  of  the  things  that  we  are  trying
to put in place at the ICAR now is a partnership with a—the local
technical university so that we provide to the upstate coalition in—
or the upstate auto cluster, I should say, a completely unified edu-
cational  program  that  ranges  from  the  technical  level  to  the  grad-
uate research level.

Dr.  HEYWOOD.  Could  I  comment  on  that  question  about  edu-

From  our  perspective,  I  think  government  graduate  fellowships
focused  on  specific  areas  do  several  very  useful  things.  They  pull
young  people  into  those  areas,  and  they  become—that  becomes
their area of expertise. And also, fellowship students are extremely
useful, from a faculty member’s perspective, because they are, in a
sense,  free  labor  to  start  on  a  new  topic.  And  so  they  really  have
an  effect  of  allowing  faculty  members  to  branch  out  into  new  re-
search  areas,  and  that  is  exactly  the  sort  of—pulling  young  people
into this—these areas that are going to be critical to us for the next
many,  many  decades,  and  also  providing  opportunities  for  starting
up  new  and,  hopefully,  interesting  and  promising  research  activi-
ties.

Back  to  the  sources  of  hydrogen,  I  would  like  to  add  just  one

cation?

comment.

I  think  it  is—Mr.  Faulkner  is  quite  right.  It  is  too  early  to  start
to  make  choices,  but  I  think  it  is  worth  saying  something  about
many  people’s  feeling  that  if  we  have  got  renewable  electricity,
then  we  can  make  hydrogen  with,  sort  of,  no  environmental  im-
pacts.  Well,  if  we  got  renewable  electricity,  that  is  fantastic  stuff,
and it will displace coal-generated electricity. And I sometimes feel
like,  well,  why  would  you  take  a  really  good  wine  and  convert  it
into  a  not  so  good  wine.  Electricity  is  a  fantastic  wine.  Hydrogen
isn’t quite as good.

So I think that is a very good question. There are questions like
that that we need to dig into, but it is too early to say. But we are
going to have to be imaginative, because if we don’t produce the hy-
drogen  without  releasing  greenhouse  gases,  we  have  really—we
have not moved forward very much at all.

Dr. CRABTREE. Yeah, may I comment on that, too?
I  would  like  to  reinforce  what  Dr.  Heywood  said  that  it  is  very
important  to  produce  the  hydrogen  without  carbon.  And  the  one
way  in  which  you  can  do  that  is  to  split  water.  There  are  many
ways  to  split  water.  You  mentioned  nuclear  and  electrolysis,  but

vehicles.

there  are  other  ways,  too,  notably  solar  energy.  It  would  be  won-
derful  to  take  a  beaker  of  water,  put  it  into  a  container  that  is
highly technological, set it in the sun, and simply produce hydrogen
with  no  other  energy  input.  And  in  fact,  that  can  be  done  in  the
laboratory  now  with  about  18  percent  efficiency.  Of  course,  it  is
much too expensive to do commercially, but I think that is the chal-
lenge.

So  if  we  can  do  that,  we  have  solved  lots  of  problems:  we  don’t
have  any  dependence  on  foreign  energy  sources,  because  the  sun
falls  on  everyone’s  head;  we  don’t  produce  any  greenhouse  gases;
we  don’t  produce  any  pollutants;  and  the  supply  is,  effectively,  in-
exhaustible.

So  I  think  this  is  the  route  we  should  go.  It  is  a  question  of

which renewable energy sources we use.

Dr. BODDE. One further comment on universities.
The  American  university  has  become  truly  an  international,
multi-national  enterprise.  There  are  students  coming  to  us  pref-
erentially  from  all  over  the  world.  We  have  attracted  into  our  uni-
versities  some  extraordinary  talent,  the  greatest  talent  that  exists
in many countries. I think we need to find ways to retain that tal-
ent within this country, not only when they are graduate students,
but  afterwards.  And  I  think  we  should  look  again  at  our  security
policies and ask if we are not straining out a whole lot of folks that
we really wish that we would have around here?

Mr.  CHERNOBY.  And  just  to  close  your  question  on  the  fuel  cell

on 

And 

Yes,  at  DaimlerChrysler,  we  have  approximately  100  different
fuel cell vehicles on the road around the world, many of those here
in  the  United  States  in  the  DOE  demonstration  project,  gaining
valuable data to help us understand what are the new problems we
face when we move from the lab to the environment.

I  would  add, 

education,  we  don’t—we,  at
DaimlerChrysler,  also  very—think  it  is  very  important  to  attract
young  people  to  the  technical  arenas.  We  participate  very  strongly
in  efforts  at  the  elementary  school  level,  the  middle  school  level,
and  through  things  like  the  first  robotics  competition  at  the  high
school level. It is absolutely critical to attract them to the technical
fields in the first place before they get to the collegiate type of envi-
ronment.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. The gentlelady’s time has expired.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much.
Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Just  a  quick  couple  of  questions  to—be-

fore we close.

Dr.  Bodde,  the  first  recommendation  of  the  National  Academy’s
report  was  for  DOE  to  develop  an  increased  ability  to  analyze  the
impact of new technologies, such as hydrogen, on the entire energy
system so that the Department can wisely set priorities for energy
R&D. How would you rate the Department’s current systems anal-
ysis  effort?  And  should  it  be  changed,  in  your  opinion,  to  improve
it?

Dr. BODDE. Well, it is certainly too early to judge, but I think the
response from the Department of Energy was quite immediate and
quite  effective.  The  office  was  established,  housed  at  the  National

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:02 Jan 27, 2006 Jkt 022549 PO 00000 Frm 00093 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ENER05\072005\22549.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

88

Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  and  has  begun  to—a  wide-scale  set
of works.

But I think this modeling of the entire energy system is very im-
portant, because, in the end, it has got to function as an integrated
system where we have got to understand how it can function as an
integrated  system.  Further,  we  have  to  understand  how  that  sys-
tem is evolving. So it is one thing to create models for the system,
but  it  is  another  thing,  also,  to  monitor  progress  as  it  goes  along
to  monitor  where  bets  are  being  placed,  say,  in  the  private  sector.
Where is private venture capital going in these things?

And  I  guess  if  I  could  offer  one  suggestion  for  a  direction  that
this  systems  integration  or  modeling  effort  would  go,  it  is  to  add
to  those  capacities  an  ability  to  look  at  where  the  private  sector  is
going right now, the bets that private investors are placing in new
technologies.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
And  then,  Dr.  Crabtree,  the  DOE  is  currently  funding  learning
demonstrations with the auto makers and energy companies. Is the
information  that  DOE  is  getting  from  the  auto  makers  worth  the
price of the demonstrations, given the technical challenges that re-
main?

Dr.  CRABTREE.  Well,  that  is  a  very  difficult  question  to  answer.
Let  me  say  something  generally,  which  may  not  be  quite  the  spe-
cific answer you are looking for.

I  think  it  is  very  important  to  have  demonstration  projects,  be-
cause  there  you  learn  what  the  problems  are,  and  you  learn  how
to innovate. And if you look at the history of energy, and let us say,
internal  combustion  engines,  that  is  how  the  progress  was  made.
So  we  can’t  discount  that  as  a  very  important  way  to  go  forward.
I  would  balance  that  with  the  feeling  that  we  need  to  put  basic
research  on  the  table  as  well.  It  is  really  both  of  those  efforts  that
are  going  to  make  the  hydrogen  economy  vibrant,  competitive,  in-
novative,  and  lasting  for  100  years,  as  the  fossil  fuel  economy  has
done.

Chairwoman  BIGGERT.  Would  you  say  that  the  money  would  be
better spent on basic research, or does there need to be a balance?
Dr.  CRABTREE.  I  think  there  needs  to  be  a  balance.  There  abso-

lutely needs to be a balance.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
And I have one more here, if I can find it.
Mr. Chernoby, what role do the entrepreneurs or start-up compa-
nies  and  venture  capitalist  investors  have  to  play  in  helping
DaimlerChrysler  accelerate  the  commercial  introduction  of  the  ad-
vanced hydrogen fuel cell vehicles?

Mr. CHERNOBY. Absolutely, they are going to play a critical role,
especially  in  those  areas  where  we  develop  a  new  technological  in-
novation  that  may  not  be  of  significant  interest  to  a  big  company
at  this  point  in  time  to  invest.  The  entrepreneur  may  be  our  ave-
nue  to  actually  get  that  into  the  commercialization,  as  Dr.  Bodde
mentioned earlier.

So we absolutely see that linkage as one that may be a very crit-

ical path in order to get this to a reality.

Dr. BODDE. Just a footnote on that, Madame Chairman.
Chairwoman BIGGERT. Sure.

Dr.  BODDE.  When  the  laser  was  first  invented  at  Bell  Labs,  the

inventors of it had a very hard time getting it patented.

And  why  did  they  have  a  hard  time  getting  it  patented?  Well,  it
turns out that, for the telephone, it was then understood there was
absolutely  no  use  for  this  innovation.  And  so  it  was  only  by  great
persuasion that Bell Labs actually managed to capture the patents
for this enormously useful, broadly applicable innovation.

Chairwoman BIGGERT. Thank you.
And  with  that  note,  we  will—before  we  bring  the  hearing  to  a
close,  I  want  to  thank  our  panelists  for  testifying  before  the  Sub-
committee  today.  I  think  it  was—you  are  just  experts  in  your
fields, and it was very, very helpful to all of us.

And if there is no objection, the record will remain open for addi-
tional statements from the Members and for answers to any follow-
up  questions  the  Subcommittee  may  ask  of  the  panelists.  So  with-
out objection, so ordered.

The hearing is now adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Douglas L. Faulkner, Acting Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and

Renewable Energy, Department of Energy

Questions  submitted  by  Chairman  Judy  Biggert  and  Chairman  Bob  Inglis
Q1. Dr. Bodde recommended that the Department of Energy (DOE) keep track of the
efforts  of  auto  suppliers  and  smaller  private  ventures  that  support  the  auto-
motive  industry.  Has  DOE  taken  any  steps  in  this  direction,  and  what  else  can
be done?

A1. We agree that it is important to stay abreast of commercial and technical devel-
opments  of  auto  suppliers  and  smaller  private  ventures.  A  strong  supplier  base  ca-
pable  of  providing  parts  for  advanced  vehicles  is  important  to  maintain  the  U.S.
auto  industry’s  competitiveness  especially  given  auto  manufacturers’  increased  reli-
ance in recent years on their first and second tier suppliers.

We  monitor  developments  at  supplier  companies  and  smaller  private  ventures  by
regularly attending technical conferences, sponsoring technology assessments, track-
ing  the  technical  literature,  visiting  R&D  facilities,  and  meeting  with  researchers.
Most  importantly,  we  provide  a  substantial  portion  of  our  transportation-related
R&D  funding  to  such  companies.  In  FY05,  the  Department  of  Energy’s,  Hydrogen,
Fuel  Cell  and  Infrastructure  Program  spent  approximately  $72  million,  or  32  per-
cent of its budget and the FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Program spent ap-
proximately  $35  million,  or  40  percent  of  its  light  duty  vehicles  budget  to  fund  re-
search  at  such  companies.  In  addition,  many  suppliers  work  directly  with  our  na-
tional laboratories which provides further insights into the types of technology chal-
lenges arising and how they are being addressed.
Q2. How  is  DOE  working  to  ensure  that  the  technologies  developed  under  the
FreedomCAR program that can be used in conventional vehicles are moved into
the  marketplace,  and  that  the  efficiency  gains  from  the  technologies  are  used  to
improve fuel economy?

A2. New vehicle technologies normally take about 15 years to reach maximum mar-
ket  penetration.  Ultimately,  companies  must  make  independent  decisions  on  which
combination  of  technologies  makes  sense  for  each  to  commercialize  based  upon  the
establishment  of  viable  business  cases.  Even  if  performance  and  cost  targets  are
met, other market factors (e.g., availability and price of gasoline, investment capital
conditions/risk,  etc.)  will  influence  industry’s  decision  to  commercialize  a  particular
technology.

DOE works closely with industry through the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership
and our cost-shared R&D projects to help strengthen the business case for the adop-
tion of technologies on which we work. Partnerships help facilitate technology trans-
fer and information dissemination by creating a common understanding of technical
capabilities  and  barriers  and  by  providing  a  forum  in  which  to  exchange  ideas.  In
addition, as technical progress is made, performance targets are met and validated,
and  cost  is  reduced,  the  technologies  become  more  attractive  for  industry  to  adopt
and commercialize.
Q3. What  steps  might  the  industry  take  to  assure  customers  that  hydrogen-powered
vehicles  meet  the  same  or  higher  standards  of  safety  compared  to  current  vehi-
cles?

A3. Ultimately,  customer  assurance  of  safety  will  be  accomplished  by  establishing
a  safety  record  and  experience  base  that  demonstrates  safe  use  of  hydrogen  by  the
public.  Since  that  experience  base  does  not  yet  exist,  it  is  critical  that  early  hydro-
gen  demonstrations  operate  with  safety  at  the  highest  priority  level.  To  accomplish
this,  both  DOE  and  industry  are  working  together  through  the  following  activities
to ensure safety:

• Establishing codes and standards. All major domestic and international codes
and  standards  organizations  are  working  with  industry  and  other  stake-
holders  to  establish  the  initial  safety  standards  and  codes  which  will  guide
the  roll-out  of  hydrogen  technology.  A  number  of  key  codes  and  standards
have  been  completed  and  are  in  the  process  of  being  adopted.  As  the  tech-
nology  evolves  over  the  next  decade,  these  codes  and  standards  will  be  re-
vised. In addition, the Department of Transportation is performing their regu-
latory  role  of  establishing  vehicle  standards,  crash  worthiness  and  pipeline
safety.

• Ensuring  safety  of  demonstration  vehicles  and  fueling.  To  ensure  safety  dur-
ing  hydrogen  demonstrations,  layers  of  safety  systems  are  being  employed.
For example: 1) Vehicles are equipped with a number of hydrogen leak detec-
tors  that  trip  below  the  concentration  level  of  hydrogen  that  would  support
combustion, 2) Accident sensors (similar to those used to deploy air bags) are
employed  to  prevent  fuel  flow  following  an  accident,  and  3)  Service  stations
are  equipped  with  sensors  and  monitors,  and  refueling  operations  are  con-
ducted by trained personnel.

• Ensuring  safety  of  DOE  projects.  DOE  has  implemented  a  series  of  measures
to ensure safe operation of our R&D program: A primary measure is the DOE
Hydrogen Safety Panel, an independent group which counsels DOE on safety
matters,  performs  reviews  of  project  safety  plans  and  conducts  site  audits  of
facility conducting R&D.

• Training.  DOE  is  working  with  government,  industry  and  fire  professionals

to develop and conduct training for first responders.

• Reporting incidents and lessons learned. DOE is in the process of establishing
an  international  hydrogen  incident  database  so  that  information  from  hydro-
gen incidents or ‘‘near-misses’’ from around the world can be shared through-
out the hydrogen community, helping to prevent future safety problems.

Q4. Professor  Heywood  argues  that  because  of  the  high  risk  of  failure  of  the  hydro-
gen research initiative, DOE should increase funding for alternative vehicle tech-
nologies,  such  as  electric  vehicles  and  biomass  fuels.  What  do  you  think  the
chances  are  that  technical  barriers  will  cause  the  hydrogen  initiative  to  fail?  Is
DOE providing enough funding to alternatives?

A4. We  believe  the  Administration’s  requests  have  provided  enough  funding  for
R&D  in  vehicles  and  biomass.  We  agree  that  their  merits  are  significant.  We  also
believe  the  chance  of  achieving  technical  success  in  the  development  of  hydrogen
technologies  is  very  good,  due  to  extensive  program  planning,  management  and  re-
view.

Question submitted by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett
Q1. In your opinion, is a limited world platinum supply likely to be a barrier to the

widespread adoption of fuel cells?

A1. No.  A  study  by  TIAX,  LLC  determined  that  there  are  sufficient  platinum  re-
sources  in  the  ground  to  meet  long-term  projected  platinum  demand  if  the  amount
of  platinum  in  fuel  cell  systems  is  reduced  to  the  Department’s  target  level.  The
DOE-sponsored  study,  shows  that  world  platinum  demand  (including  jewelry,  fuel
cell and industrial applications) by 2050 would be 20,000 metric tons against a total
projected  resource  of  76,000  metric  tons.  This  study  assumes  that  fuel  cell  vehicles
attain  80  percent  market  penetration  by  2050  (from  U.S.,  Western  Europe,  China,
India  and  Japan).  The  study  shows  that  the  limiting  factor  in  keeping  up  with  in-
creased platinum demand is the ability of the industry to respond and install addi-
tional  production  infrastructure.  Since  in  the  out-years,  recycling  would  provide  al-
most  60  percent  of  the  supply,  the  industry  will  have  to  be  careful  not  to  overbuild
production capacity in a more accelerated market demand scenario.

• Platinum  availability  is  a  strategic  issue  for  the  commercialization  of  hydro-
gen  fuel  cell  vehicles.  Platinum  is  expensive  and  is  currently  critical  to
achieving  the  required  levels  of  fuel  cell  power  density  and  efficiency.  As
such, the Department has been focused on reducing and substituting for (with
non-precious  metal  catalysts)  the  amount  of  platinum  in  fuel  cell  stacks
(while  maintaining  performance  and  durability)  so  that  hydrogen  fuel  cells
can be cost competitive with gasoline internal combustion engines.

• Significant  progress  has  been  made  and  is  still  being  made  by  national  lab-
oratories, universities and industry to reduce the amount of platinum needed
in  a  fuel  cell  stack  by  replacing  platinum  catalysts  with  platinum  alloy  cata-
lysts  or  non-platinum  catalysts,  enhancing  the  specific  activity  of  platinum
containing  catalysts,  and  depositing  these  catalysts  on  electrodes  using  inno-
vative  processes.  The  Office  of  Science  has  recently  initiated  new  basic  re-
search  projects  on  the  design  of  catalysts  at  the  nanoscale  that  focus  on  con-
tinued  reduction  in  the  amount  of  platinum  catalyst  required  in  fuel  cell
stacks.

• Typically, it takes three to five years to increase platinum production capacity
in response to an increase in demand. Fuel cell vehicle production may create
a brief platinum supply deficit, leading to short-term price increases.
• The  TIAX  study  shows  that  platinum  prices  over  the  last  one  hundred  years
fluctuated  based  on  major  world  events  (e.g.,  world  war,  etc.),  however,  the
mean  price  (adjusted  for  inflation)  remained  stable  at  $300  per  troy  ounce.
However, over the last couple of years platinum has been higher at $900 per
troy ounce.

Question submitted by Representative Michael E. Sodrel
Q1. Please  provide  details  of  Iceland’s  effort  to  convert  entirely  to  a  hydrogen  econ-
omy. Is DOE working with Iceland on this effort? Have they made any advances,
including  in  geothermal  energy,  that  will  help  to  advance  a  hydrogen  economy
in the U.S.?

A1. Iceland’s  goal  is  to  become  the  first  nation  in  the  world  to  achieve  the  vision
of  a  hydrogen  economy.  The  move  to  a  hydrogen  economy  has  significant  govern-
ment  support,  and  surveys  conducted  by  Icelandic  New  Energy  indicate  significant
public support as well. With a population of less than 300,000 (the majority of which
resides in the capital of Reykjavik), transforming the Icelandic transportation sector
to  hydrogen  will  require  far  fewer  hydrogen  fueling  stations  than  what  will  be  re-
quired in the United States. Advances include:

• Iceland  has  an  abundance  of  relatively  inexpensive  renewable  energy  that  is
used  for  heating  and  provides  100  percent  of  the  Nation’s  electricity  (80  per-
cent from hydropower and 20 percent from geothermal).
• Currently,  there  is  one  hydrogen  fueling  station,  located  along  a  major  high-
way  in  Reykjavik,  which  serves  as  a  national  demonstration  project.  Hydro-
gen  is  produced  on  site  via  renewable  electrolysis.  The  station  is  a  publicly
accessible  retail  fueling  station  that  also  offers  gasoline  and  diesel  and  in-
cludes  a  convenience  store.  It  supports  the  operation  of  three  hydrogen  fuel
cell  buses  that  run  regular  routes  around  Reykjavik;  there  are  no  other  hy-
drogen vehicles at this time.
• The next phase of the country’s hydrogen demonstration will involve the con-
version  of  the  entire  Reykjavik  bus  fleet  to  hydrogen.  Future  phases  will  in-
clude promoting the integration of fuel cell powered vehicles for passenger use
and  examining  the  possibility  of  replacing  the  fishing  fleet  with  hydrogen
based vessels.
• Iceland  collaborates  with  the  United  States  through  the  International  Part-
nership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE), which was established in Novem-
ber  2003  to  facilitate  global  collaboration  on  hydrogen  and  fuel  cell  research,
development,  and  demonstration  (RD&D).  With  a  membership  including  16
countries  and  the  European  Commission,  the  IPHE  provides  a  forum  for
leveraging  scarce  RD&D  funds,  harmonizing  codes  and  standards,  and  edu-
cating  stakeholders  and  the  general  public  on  the  benefits  of  and  challenges
to the hydrogen economy.

Question submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Given  the  level  of  innovation  in  advanced  vehicle  technologies  as  demonstrated
by foreign-owned automobile manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda,
would  it  benefit  the  U.S.  to  expand  more  of  the  cooperative  research,  develop-
ment  and  demonstration  programs  (including  FreedomCAR)  to  include  foreign-
owned companies with domestic R&D and manufacturing facilities?

A1. The  Department’s  public/private  partnership  to  develop  hydrogen  and  hybrid-
electric  vehicle  technologies—the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  is  not  a  part-
nership  with  individual  auto  companies,  but  is  between  DOE  and  the  U.S.  Council
for  Automotive  Research  (USCAR).  Under  the  USCAR  umbrella,  car  companies  are
able to engage in cooperative, pre-competitive research, and to coordinate the indus-
try’s  interaction  with  government  research  organizations.  Auto  companies  that  are
conducting  substantial  automotive  research  and  development  activities  within  the
U.S. are able to apply for membership in USCAR.

Even though many foreign companies have substantial production facilities within
the  United  States,  they  do  not  have  staff  in  North  America  with  the  appropriate
R&D expertise or experience to qualify for participation in the development of tech-
nology goals and milestones for these programs.

Foreign  car  companies,  however,  have  been  and  continue  to  be  able  to  contribute
their ideas to the programs by meeting with DOE program managers and by partici-
pating in DOE workshops, stakeholder meetings, program reviews, and solicitations.
They also are able to provide input through public comments on pre-solicitation and
go/no-go  decision  notices.  We  also  frequently  visit  their  R&D  facilities  and  monitor
technological developments outside of the United States.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  David  L.  Bodde,  Director,  Innovation  and  Public  Policy,  International

Center for Automotive Research, Clemson University

Questions  submitted  by  Chairman  Judy  Biggert  and  Chairman  Bob  Inglis
Q1. What  steps  might  the  industry  take  to  assure  customers  that  hydrogen-powered
vehicles  meet  the  same  or  higher  standards  of  safety  compared  to  current  vehi-
cles?

A1. Years of experience with hydrogen production and use clearly demonstrate that
a  high  degree  of  safety  can  be  achieved.  But  all  this  experience  has  been  gained  in
applications that are professionally managed and maintained. When hydrogen is in-
troduced  into  the  consumer  economy,  an  entirely  different  set  of  issues  arise,  not
only for consumers but also for first-responders to emergencies.

Safety will be especially important during the transition period, as any hydrogen-
related accidents will draw intense public scrutiny. This applies to every part of the
hydrogen  supply  chain—production,  logistics,  dispensing,  and  on-vehicle  use.  Thus,
all parts of an emerging hydrogen industry, not just the vehicle makers, must move
aggressively to define and resolve potential safety issues. The Department of Energy
should  take  the  lead  here—for  example,  by  raising  the  importance  of  safety  in  its
FreedomCAR  program.  This  could  be  done  by  creating  a  ‘‘safety  team’’  in  addition
to  the  team  developing  codes  and  standards.  Further,  safety  should  be  considered
a system-wide issue and integrated into all the technical teams.

Some  specific  issues  pose  special  concerns.  In  my  view,  high  pressure  hydrogen
storage  on-board  vehicles  poses  the  greatest  single  safety  challenge,  especially  as
these  vehicles  age.  Plainly,  much  design  effort  should  be  devoted  to  fail-safe  sys-
tems,  and  manufacturers  must  build  these  vehicles  for  quality  and  durability.  For
the  longer-term,  low-pressure,  solid-state  storage  systems  might  offer  relief,  but  for
now these remain research goals and far from marketplace reality.

Finally,  all  companies  participating  in  the  emerging  hydrogen  economy  must
share  safety-related  information  widely.  This  serves  their  self  interest,  as  an  acci-
dent anywhere is likely to impugn hydrogen activities everywhere.
Q2. What have you learned from your experience on the National Academies’ review

panel on FreedomCAR? What recommendations do you feel most important?

A2. The  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  takes  on  an  extraordinary  challenge:
to  precipitate  revolutionary  change  in  a  global  vehicle  and  fuels  infrastructure  that
has  served  well  for  over  100  years  and  that  continues  to  perform  well  from  a  con-
sumer  perspective.  The  challenge  is  in  part  technological,  but  in  equal  measure  it
is social and economic—yet the chief policy instrument used by the Federal Govern-
ment has been technology development. The technologists, however, cannot do it all,
and private businesses must respond to the marketplace. Therefore, success will re-
quire  strong  and  consistent  leadership  from  elected  officials  in  order  to  supplement
technology as a pathway to change.

In  my  view,  the  most  important  recommendation  from  the  National  Academies’

review were:

• Hydrogen  storage  and  fuel  cell  performance.  Extraordinarily  ambitious  goals
have  been  set  for  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership,  especially  in  the
crucial  areas  of  on-vehicle  hydrogen  storage  and  fuel  cell  performance.  In-
creased  attention  and  support  will  be  required,  especially  for  membrane  re-
search, new catalyst systems, electrode design, and all aspects of energy stor-
age.

• Risk  hedging.  As  a  hedge  against  delay  in  meeting  these  goals,  the  program

should emphasize:

Æ Advanced combustion engines and emissions controls;
Æ Battery storage of energy, a ‘‘no regrets’’ strategy that will also serve the
hybrid  electric  vehicles,  plug-hybrids,  and  eventually  the  hydrogen  fuel
cell vehicle; and,

Æ Management  of  electric  energy  systems,  also  serving  all  forms  of  electric

drive vehicles.

• Congressionally directed funding. The panel noted that diversion of resources
from  critical  technology  areas  increases  the  risk  that  the  program  will  not
meet its goals in a timely manner.

Q3. Professor  Heywood  argues  that  because  of  the  high  risk  of  failure  of  the  hydro-
gen  research  initiative,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  should  increase  fund-
ing  for  alternative  vehicle  technologies,  such  as  electric  motors  and  biomass
fuels.  What  do  you  think  the  chances  are  that  technical  barriers  will  cause  the
hydrogen initiative to fail? Is DOE providing enough funding to alternatives?

A3. My own concern is not so much that the hydrogen initiative will fail by encoun-
tering some fundamental physical barrier. Rather, I fear that technical barriers and
parsimonious funding will delay deployment of a hydrogen economy well beyond the
goals set by the DOE.

In the meantime, this nation—and, indeed, the world—will continue to rely in the
internal combustion engine. Therefore, simple prudence would suggest we hedge our
bets  (as  above)  both  with  improvements  to  the  ICE  and  with  alternative  fuels  that
could backstop a delayed hydrogen economy.

Question submitted by Representative W. Todd Akin
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  stated  that,  ‘‘coal  offers  the  lowest  cost  pathway  to  a  hy-
drogen  based  energy  economy.’’  However,  within  DOE,  the  carbon  sequestration
program is managed separately from the hydrogen and vehicles programs. What
can  we  do  as  a  Congress  to  encourage  greater  cooperation  between  these  pro-
grams, and how does the current structure of DOE hinder efforts to use coal for
hydrogen fuel cells?

A1. This  separation  has  concerned  at  least  two  National  Academies’  committees  as
well. The concern is to bring the several parts of this very complex set of programs
to  fruition  at  the  appropriate  time.  The  systems  analysis  function  was  established
to  provide  the  analytical  means  to  accomplish  this.  However,  implementation,  as
you note, is in question.

Question submitted by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett
Q1. In  your  opinion,  is  the  limited  world  platinum  supply  likely  to  be  a  barrier  to

the widespread adoption of fuel cells?

A1. Yes,  we  plainly  must  develop  alternative  design  approaches  that  avoid  the  use
of expensive materials like platinum. Otherwise, fuel cells will become too costly for
wide  scale  deployment.  Membrane  and  catalyst  research  will  be  important  here—
see response A2 to Chairman Biggert and Chairman Inglis, above.

Question submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Given  the  level  of  innovation  in  advanced  vehicle  technologies  as  demonstrated
by foreign-owned automobile manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan, and Honda,
would  it  benefit  the  U.S.  to  expand  more  of  the  cooperative  research,  develop-
ment, and demonstration programs (including FreedomCAR) to include foreign-
owned companies with domestic R&D and manufacturing facilities?

A1. Yes, I think there could be some value in that, though the information sharing
must be reciprocal. But more importantly, I believe the FreedomCAR and Fuel Part-
nership should make greater efforts to engage the entrepreneurial sector of the U.S.
economy.  If  we  look  at  past  technological  revolutions,  we  observe  that  the  industry
incumbents  rarely  led  the  change.  The  telegraph  companies  did  not  bring  us  the
telephone,  the  telephone  companies  did  not  bring  us  the  Internet,  and  the  electron
tube  makers  did  not  bring  us  solid  state  electronics.  Thus,  much  evidence  suggests
that encouraging entrepreneurship in road transportation might provide a powerful
pathway to a hydrogen economy.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Mark  Chernoby,  Vice  President,  Advanced  Vehicle  Engineering,

DaimlerChrysler Corporation

Questions  submitted  by  Chairman  Judy  Biggert  and  Chairman  Bob  Inglis
Q1. What  steps  might  the  industry  take  to  assure  customers  that  hydrogen-powered
vehicles  meet  the  same  or  higher  standards  of  safety  compared  to  current  vehi-
cles?

A1. Hydrogen-powered  vehicles  will  be  required  to  meet  the  same  safety  standards
as  current  vehicles.  What  government  and  industry  can  do  together  to  prepare  the
public  for  hydrogen  vehicles  is  safety  education.  For  example,  first  responders  to  a
hydrogen vehicle accident need to know proper procedures for ensuring safety of the
vehicle  occupants  just  as  they  have  been  trained  for  current  vehicles.  A  good  first
step  towards  this  end  is  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Hydrogen  Vehicle  Validation
program.  Government  and  industry  are  working  together  to  develop  public  edu-
cation programs that include hydrogen safety.
Q2. Professor  Heywood  argues  that  because  of  the  high  risk  of  failure  of  the  hydro-

the  Department  of  Energy’s  alternative  vehicle 

A2. As  a  partner  of  the  FreedomCAR  program  we  are  satisfied  with  the  diversity
of 
research  programs.
DaimlerChrysler  also  believes  as  Professor  Heywood  in  a  broad  research  portfolio
approach to the future. Hydrogen storage is one of the high risk challenges for pub-
lic  acceptance  of  a  hydrogen  vehicle.  The  challenge  is  high  but  it  is  a  risk  we  must
take as we pursue all alternatives to the current vehicle propulsion technologies.

Question submitted by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett
Q1. In your opinion, is a limited world platinum supply likely to be a barrier to the

widespread adoption of fuel cells?

A1. The  current  platinum  loading  of  fuel  cell  electrodes  is  cost  prohibitive  for  most
commercial  applications.  In  order  to  gain  consumer  acceptance  platinum  in  a  fuel
cell must be reduced to a fraction of the current level. Therefore, the supply of plat-
inum will be of less concern when fuel cells are ready for the mass market.

vehicles  meet  the  same  or  higher  standards  of  safety  compared  to  current  vehi-
cles?

A1. The  public  acceptance  of  hydrogen  depends  not  only  on  its  practical  and  com-
mercial appeal, but also on its record of safety in widespread use. The special flam-
mability, buoyancy, and permeability of hydrogen present challenges to its safe use
that are different, but not necessarily more difficult, than for other energy carriers.
One important step to insuring hydrogen safety is research to understand the com-
bustibility  of  hydrogen  in  open  spaces  where  it  is  naturally  diluted  and  in  closed
spaces  where  it  may  concentrate  by  accumulation.  Additional  areas  of  research
needed  for  hydrogen  safety  are  the  effect  of  mixing  with  volatile  hydrocarbons  like
gasoline  or  alchohol,  on  hydrogen  ignition,  the  embrittlement  of  materials  by  expo-
sure  to  hydrogen  that  may  cause  leaks,  and  the  development  of  sensing  techniques
selective for hydrogen.

A  second  key  element  is  development  of  effective  safety  standards  and  practices
that  are  widely  known  and  routinely  used,  like  those  for  self-service  gasoline  sta-
tions  or  plug-in  electrical  appliances.  Despite  the  danger  of  open  exposure  to  gaso-
line  and  household  electricity,  the  injury  rate  from  these  hazards  has  been  mini-
mized  by  thorough  education  to  a  few  simple  codes  and  standards.  Similar  codes
and standards need to be developed and widely disseminated for hydrogen.
Q2. In your testimony, you explain the challenge of hydrogen storage as follows: that
we  are  searching  for  a  material  that  allows,  at  the  same  time,  both  close  and
loose packing and weak and strong bonding of hydrogen molecules. Is there any
known  precedent  or  parallel  phenomenon  that  gives  us  some  confidence  that
such a material exists or can be created?

A2. The  challenge  of  simultaneously  satisfying  the  twin  criteria  of  high  storage  ca-
pacity and fast charge/release rates is formidable. However advances in nanoscience
over  the  last  five  years  open  promising  new  horizons  for  satisfying  the  seemingly
conflicting  requirements  of  strong  bonding  and  close  packing  for  high  capacity  and
weak bonding and loose packing for fast charge/release. A storage medium composed
of  tiny  nanoparticles,  for  example,  can  provide  short  diffusion  lengths  for  hydrogen
within  the  nanoparticle  leading  to  high  charge/release  rates,  combined  with  dense
packing of hydrogen as a chemical compound with the host medium. Two promising
new  materials  have  been  developed  in  the  last  year:  ammonium  borane  (NH3BH3)
and  MgC12(NH3)6,  each  of  which  can  be  artificially  nanostructured  to  enhance  its
release rate while maintaining its high hydrogen storage capacity.

The  search  for  new  nanostructured  storage  materials  is  enormously  streamlined
by  theoretical  modeling  of  their  storage  behavior  using  modern  density  functional
theory  implemented  on  computer  clusters  containing  hundreds  of  nodes.  Such  ad-
vanced  modeling  enables  accurate  simulation  of  the  storage  capacity  and  release
rate  of  hundreds  of  candidate  materials  without  the  expensive  and  time  consuming
step of fabricating them in the laboratory. This efficient ‘‘virtual screening’’ dramati-
cally  increases  the  number  of  materials  that  can  be  searched,  with  only  the  most
promising  candidates  tested  for  physical  performance  in  the  laboratory.  The  formu-
lation of density functional theory and powerful computer clusters enabling this effi-
cient screening were not available even a few years ago.
Q3. Professor  Heywood  argues  that  because  of  the  high  risk  of  failure  of  the  hydro-
gen  research  initiative,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  should  increase  fund-
ing  for  alternative  vehicle  technologies,  such  as  electric  vehicles  and  biomass
fuels.  What  do  you  think  the  chances  are  that  technical  barriers  will  cause  the
hydrogen initiative to fail? Is DOE providing enough funding to alternatives?

A3. The demand for energy is projected to double by 2050 and triple by 2100. This
means that by 2050 we must create an energy supply chain and infrastructure that
duplicates  today’s  capacity.  This  challenge  is  beyond  the  reach  of  a  single  energy
source  or  energy  carrier.  To  meet  the  challenge,  we  must  develop  a  mix  of  energy
options and rely on each to shoulder a portion of the load. Like hydrogen, the alter-
natives  suggested  by  Professor  Heywood  are  worthy  of  serious  consideration,  but
they  are  not  without  their  risks.  Electric  vehicles  substitute  electricity  for  fossil

fuels at the point of use, but the electricity they require must be generated, typically
from  burning  fossil  fuels  like  coal  and  natural  gas.  Thus  the  pollution,  greenhouse
gas  emission,  and  fossil  fuel  consumption  at  the  point  of  use  is  simply  shifted  to
the point of electricity production. This option has approximately neutral impact on
the national energy challenges of adequate supply, secure access, local pollution and
climate change.

Biomass  fuels,  while  carbon  neutral,  are  not  plentiful  enough  to  displace  all  the
gasoline  used  for  transportation  in  the  Nation.  Even  the  most  optimistic  estimates
for  biomass  fuels  claim  only  to  be  able  to  replace  the  foreign  oil  used  for  transpor-
tation, and this would occur only after a long development period graced by signifi-
cant  breakthroughs  in  genetic  engineering  that  are  presently  beyond  the  reach  of
science. Because significant breakthroughs are required, it is impossible to rank the
risk of failure of biomass fuels as greater or less than that of hydrogen.

Many  energy  options  must  be  developed  simultaneously,  and  each  will  require
breakthroughs  that  we  do  not  know  how  to  achieve  at  present.  Hydrogen  solves  all
four national energy challenges: it is abundant, widely accessible, and free of pollu-
tion  and  greenhouse  gas  emission  if  produced  by  splitting  water  renewably.  Other
energy  options  like  electric  cars  and  fuel  from  biomass  address  only  some  of  the
challenges, and may require equally expensive and difficult breakthroughs. Without
the  advantage  of  a  crystal  ball,  it  is  prudent  to  invest  in  several  of  the  most  prom-
ising  energy  options.  Hydrogen  is  among  the  most  promising  options,  for  its  ability
to  address,  and  perhaps  solve,  all  four  energy  challenges.  Alternatives  should  also
be  funded,  though  electric  cars  themselves  have  little  direct  impact  on  the  energy
challenges.  Biomass  addresses  climate  change  much  less  effectively  than  hydrogen
(it  is  carbon-neutral,  while  hydrogen  is  carbon-free)  and  is  only  abundant  enough,
even  with  massive  planting  of  energy  crops,  to  supply  a  fraction  of  our  transpor-
tation fuel needs.

Question submitted by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett
Q1. In your opinion, is a limited world platinum supply likely to be a barrier to the

widespread adoption of fuel cells?

A1. There  is  consensus  that  if  all  the  family  cars  and  light  trucks  in  the  Nation
were converted to hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, there is not enough platinum in the
world  to  supply  the  catalysts  needed  for  their  operation.  This  is  a  clear  barrier  to
the  immediate  replacement  of  internal  combustion  engines  with  fuel  cells  using
present technology. However, many other factors, such as the lack of viable on board
hydrogen storage media, the short lifetime of fuel cell energy converters under nor-
mal automotive use, the poor starting performance of fuel cells in cold weather, and
the high expense of fuel cells compared to internal combustion engines, prevent sig-
nificant  penetration  of  fuel  cell  cars  in  the  marketplace  in  the  near  future.  Under
these  conditions,  the  scarcity  of  platinum  for  catalysts  is  not  the  major  factor  lim-
iting widespread use of fuel cell automobiles.

The  replacement  of  platinum  by  less  expensive  and  more  active  catalysts  is  a  vi-
brant  field  of  research  with  promise  of  significant  progress  before  the  other  factors
limiting  fuel  cell  penetration  are  resolved.  We  know  that  plentiful,  less  expensive
catalysts exist, because we see them every day in the biological world. Green plants
use  abundant,  inexpensive  manganese  as  their  catalyst  for  the  water  splitting  step
in photosynthesis. The molecular configurations and reaction pathways for the catal-
ysis of water splitting in plants, however, remains tantalizingly just beyond our sci-
entific  reach.  Using  powerful  computer  analysis  and  the  world’s  most  intense  x-ray
sources located at DOE national laboratories, scientists are now on the verge of solv-
ing the structures of the natural catalytic reactors that plants use in photosynthesis.
When these catalytic mechanisms are fully revealed in a few years, we will be able
to  reproduce  them,  perhaps  in  improved  form,  for  use  in  the  artificial  environment
of  fuel  cells.  This  breakthrough,  which  is  now  within  sight,  will  open  new  horizons
for catalysis not only in fuel cells, but also in a host of other energy conversion ap-
plications.  It’s  achievement  will  require  significant  advances  in  several  scientific
frontiers: high resolution structure determination, advanced density functional mod-
eling  of  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  the  catalytic  process,  and  nanoscale  fabrica-
tion of artificial catalytic assemblies. Investments in these high risk-high payoff sci-
entific  advances  will  yield  ample  dividends  in  fundamental  knowledge  and  control
of the natural catalytic mechanism of green plants.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  John  B.  Heywood,  Director,  Sloan  Automotive  Laboratory,  Massachu-

setts Institute of Technology

Questions  submitted  by  Chairman  Judy  Biggert  and  Chairman  Bob  Inglis
Q1. What  steps  might  the  industry  take  to  assure  customers  that  hydrogen-powered
vehicles  meet  the  same  or  higher  standards  of  safety  compared  to  current  vehi-
cles?

A1. Safety  is  a  major  concern  in  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuels  Program.  The
FreedomCAR  and  Fuels  Program  has  a  group  within  its  management  structure
which  involves  representatives  from  industry  that  is  focused  on  safety.  An  under-
standing  of  the  key  safety  issues  and  appropriate  responses  to  those  issues  are
being developed. Existing vehicle and fuel safety regulations will apply to hydrogen-
fueled vehicles, and the need for new requirements and standards is being explored.
Dealing  with  hydrogen-related  safety  issues  will  be  a  significant  challenge,  but  in
my  judgment  is  unlikely  to  be  a  show-stopper.  Those  involved  in  the  program  are
well  aware  that  major  safety  incidents  would  adversely  affect  the  broader  public’s
response to an evolving hydrogen-fueled vehicle program.
Q2. You make several recommendations for areas to receive increased funding, rang-
ing  from  improved  combustion  engines  to  electric  batteries.  Unfortunately,  we
are  living  in  difficult  budget  times,  and  any  increase  must  be  accompanied  by
a  decrease,  or  an  increase  in  revenues.  Are  there  areas  of  research  that  you  feel
the Federal Government should not be funding at current levels?

A2. We  are  living  in  difficult  budget  times  because  of  the  tax  reductions  the  Presi-
dent  and  Congress  have  implemented  over  the  past  five  years.  Few  of  us  have  yet
realized  just  how  serious  our  transportation  energy  predicament  is,  or  that  petro-
leum  availability  shortages  could  affect  our  transportation  system  within  the  next
decade  or  so.  Failure  of  the  supply  of  gasoline,  diesel,  and  aviation  fuel  to  grow  to
meet  the  anticipated  growth  in  demand  for  these  fuels  (both  in  the  U.S.  an  else-
where)  would  be  expected  to  create  major  economic  and  social  impacts.  It  would
take significant time before we would be able to respond effectively.

We need to recognize that substantial government R&D support for several poten-
tially  promising  engine,  fuel,  and  vehicle  technology  opportunities  will  be  required
to move these technologies forward towards potential deployment. We need a broad-
er and more balanced U.S. transportation energy technology R&D program; our cur-
rent  government  efforts  are  too  focused  on  hydrogen  which,  while  promising,  may
not in the end prove to be implementable. Our longer-term choices in the transpor-
tation energy area (hydrogen and fuel cells, electricity and battery powered vehicles,
much  lighter  and  smaller  vehicles,  biomass-based  fuels,  liquid  fuels  from  oil  sands,
heavy oil, coal) are all extremely challenging ones to attempt to implement.

Are  there  areas  where  the  federal  R&D  budget  could  be  cut  to  provide  resources
for  a  broader  set  of  such  initiatives?  I  do  not  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  our  gov-
ernment’s  R&D  activities  in  an  overview  sense  to  attempt  an  answer  to  that  ques-
tion.  One  factor  that  makes  that  an  especially  difficult  question,  in  my  judgment,
is that our government lacks a coherent industrial and technology development pol-
icy.  One  consequence  of  that  lack  is  that  we  risk  losing  our  global  leadership  posi-
tion  in  transportation  energy  technologies  and  the  business  opportunities  that  go
with that leadership role.

Question submitted by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett
Q1. In your opinion, is a limited world platinum supply likely to be a barrier to the

widespread adoption of fuel cells?

A1. Platinum  production  capacity  would  have  to  expand  substantially  if  current
technology  fuel  cells  (which  have  a  high  platinum  requirement)  were  produced  in
large  numbers.  However,  they  will  not  be  produced  in  large  numbers  because  cur-
rent  technology  fuel  cells  are  too  expensive  to  be  commercially  viable,  and  their
technology  with  its  substantial  platinum  requirement  will  have  to  change  signifi-
cantly before fuel cells can become commercially viable. What is already happening
that  will  stress  the  platinum  supply  system  is  the  growth  in  light-duty  vehicles
worldwide  (from  750  million  today  to  an  anticipated  two  billion  in  2050),  and  the
expanding  demand  for  automotive  catalysts  and  their  requirement  for  noble  metals
like  platinum  that  goes  along  with  that  worldwide  vehicle  growth.  Thus,  it  is  clear
that  much  improved  automotive  fuel  cell  technology,  with  much  lower  platinum

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Q1a. What  progress  has  been  made  toward  addressing  the  principal  technical  bar-
riers  to  a  successful  transition  to  the  use  of  hydrogen  as  a  primary  transpor-
tation  fuel  since  the  Administration  announced  its  hydrogen  initiatives,
FreedomCAR and the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative?

A1a. The National Academies’ report, The Hydrogen Economy: Opportunities, Costs,
Barriers, and R&D Needs (http//www.nap.edu/books/0309091632/html/), published in
2004,  identifies  the  following  principal  technical  barriers  to  a  successful  transition
to  the  use  of  hydrogen  as  a  primary  transportation  fuel:  1)  Development  and  intro-
duction  of  cost-effective,  durable,  safe,  and  environmentally  desirable  fuel  cell  sys-
tems and hydrogen storage systems; 2) development of the infrastructure to provide
hydrogen for the light-duty-vehicle user; 3) sharp reduction in the costs of hydrogen
production from renewable energy sources over a time frame of decades; and 4) cap-
ture  and  storage  (‘‘sequestering’’)  of  the  carbon  dioxide  by-product  of  hydrogen  pro-
duction from coal.

The National Science Foundation, as part of the interagency Hydrogen R&D Task
Force, established and co-chaired by OSTP and DOE, participates in monthly meet-
ings  at  the  White  House  Conference  Center  in  order  to  ensure  coordination  among
the agencies and to address relevant research related to potential technical barriers.
NSF-supported  principal  investigators  (PIs)  have  contributed  to  important  develop-
ments  addressing  hydrogen  production  and  storage  and  fuel  cell-related  basic  re-
search.  For  production  of  hydrogen,  a  progression  can  be  expected  of  using  natural
gas, then coal, biomass, and ultimately water as feedstocks. One NSF PI is studying
improved  production  of  hydrogen  from  methane  (a  principal  component  of  natural
gas)  and  the  oxygen  in  air  using  high  pressures  and  reactor  conditions  that  favor
so-called  ‘‘cool  flames.’’  Such  systems  hold  promise  for  substantially  improving  the
ratio  of  hydrogen  to  water  produced  in  the  reaction  and  have  the  advantage  that

showAward.do?AwardNumber=0215756).

New reforming catalysts that produce hydrogen from hydrocarbons and steam and
that have increased activity and improved stability toward key catalyst poisons are
being identified through NSF awards. In addition, new catalytic routes to hydrogen
from  renewable  resources  like  plant  byproducts  have  been  developed  for  use  in
water  (http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/03/pr0369.htm)  and  could  to  used  in  fuel
cell  applications.  Some  progress  has  been  made  in  developing  a  new  generation  of
non-platinum-based fuel cell catalysts.

Advances in research related to formation of hydrogen from water are exemplified
by  Science  magazine’s  having  listed  water  as  a  Breakthrough  of  the  Year  for  2004.
NSF  PIs  are  determining  structural  and  dynamic  properties  of  nanoscale  clusters
of  small  numbers  of  water  molecules  and  how  they  interact  with  the  protons  and
electrons  that  are  intimately  involved  in  charge  transfer  leading  to  hydrogen  pro-
duction.  Their  studies  are  also  addressing  the  nature  of  bonds  between  water  mol-
ecules  and  surfaces,  information  that  will  help  us  understand  reactions  at  fuel  cell
electrodes.  Progress  in  catalyzed  photo-induced  electron  transfer  that  is  relevant  to
production  of  hydrogen  from  renewable  solar  energy  has  been  reported  from  work
conducted  by  NSF  PIs  and  provides  insight  into  the  multiple  electron  transfer
events that characterize this process.

Materials for storing hydrogen are under active development by NSF PIs. ‘‘Molec-
ular  containers’’  that  are  porous  on  the  nanoscale  are  being  synthesized  and  their
hydrogen-storage properties characterized, as are various solid-state materials rang-
ing  from  metal  alloys  to  carbon  nanotubes.  These  developments  have  been  recently
summarized 
http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/83/i34/html/
8334altenergy.html.  NSF  PIs  have  also 
like  palladium
nanowires  that  can  detect  hydrogen  at  extremely  low  concentrations.  Such  sensor
materials  could  serve  as  leak  detectors  for  hydrogen  and  contribute  to  its  safe  use
in storage and transportation systems.

identified  materials 

Fuel  cell  developments  attributable  to  NSF  support  are  exemplified  by  progress
in  low-temperature  versions  of  these  devices.  In  particular,  improved  performance
has been seen with the introduction of fully fluorinated membranes and better elec-
trode structures that increase catalyst utilization.

High  temperature  Solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFCs)  have  the  potential  to  operate  at
high efficiency without noble metal catalysts. Currently available oxide membranes,
which are critical for ionic transport in higher-temperature fuel cells, are inefficient
and fail to operate at the lower temperatures needed for use in transportation. Sev-
eral  NSF  projects  are  focused  on  studying  lover-temperature  oxide-ion  membranes

to  minimize  corrosion  and  differential  thermal  expansion,  while  maintaining  selec-
tivity and permeability.

Also  noteworthy  has  been  the  success  of  NSF  PIs  in  exploiting  the  exquisite  ma-
chinery  of  microbes,  which  can  utilize  hydrogen  without  the  elaborate  storage  and
pressure systems of conventional approaches. A single-chambered microbial fuel cell
(http://www.nsf.gov/news/news¥summ.jsp?cntn¥id=100337)  has  been  shown  re-
cently to offer highly mobile and efficient energy production.
Q1b. What are the remaining potential technical ‘‘showstoppers?’’
A1b. The  aforementioned  National  Academies’ 
several
‘‘showstoppers.’’  For  example,  at  this  time,  capabilities  of  hydrogen  storage  mate-
rials  are  still  inadequate.  If  catalysts  for  fuel  cells  are  to  he  economically  competi-
tive, they would either need to be about an order of magnitude more active and have
high resistance to poisoning by carbon monoxide if they contain expensive platinum;
or alternative, efficient non-platinum-based catalysts would need to be found. There
are also challenges associated with developing manufacturing techniques that would
enable  catalyst  coatings  to  be  deposited  uniformly  on  surfaces  of  arbitrary  shape.
Q2a. What are the research areas where breakthroughs are needed to advance a hy-

report  articulates 

drogen economy?

A2a. Catalysis  impacts  many  of  the  technical  areas  for  which  breakthroughs  are
needed  to  drive  a  hydrogen  economy.  Ranging  from  fuel  cell  electrodes  to  photo-in-
duced  production  of  hydrogen,  better  catalysts  will  be  critical  for  making  progress.
In  turn,  catalyst  improvement  requires  better  understanding  of  a  variety  of  tech-
nical  issues.  Membrane  performance,  for  instance,  demands  excellent  ionic  conduc-
tivity along with physical and chemical durability. Such a combination of properties
poses  a  challenge  due  to  the  lack  of  fundamental  knowledge  of  synthesis-structure-
function  relationships  in  the  polymers  that  are  commonly  employed  as  membranes.
Another example involves the use of platinum supported on carbon for electro-catal-
ysis  in  low-temperature  acid  fuel  cells.  Reduction  of  loadings  of  platinum  or  other
precious  metal  in  electrodes  has  been  identified  as  essential  in  order  to  reduce  sys-
tem costs, but there are also problems with catalyst dissolution and corrosion of the
material that supports the catalyst.

Novel materials are needed for safe and reliable hydrogen production and storage,
as well as for developing infrastructure to distribute hydrogen. Failure mechanisms
due to materials degradation, such as hydrogen-induced embrittlement in pipelines,
need  to  be  understood  and  controlled.  As  noted  above,  better  membrane  materials
for fuel cells and superior hydrogen storage materials are needed.

Most hydrogen is currently synthesized from natural gas. Other potential sources
of hydrogen include coal and biomass through gasification processes. Basic research
is  needed  to  identify  optimal  hydrogen  production  strategies  from  these  feedstocks
and,  for  biomass,  to  ensure  effective  gas  cleanup.  Carbon  management  must  be  ad-
dressed when using fossil fuels as a feedstock.

Splitting  water  through  electrolysis  and  photolysis  needs  to  be  aggressively  pur-
sued.  Fundamental  questions  about  water’s  properties  at  the  molecular  level  still
exist and must be resolved if we are to design systems that can more efficiently split
water by photochemical or electrochemical means.

There  are  also  basic  questions  about  biological  systems  that  use  hydrogen  that
hold  promise  for  significant  increases  in  energy  efficiency  if  they  could  be  used  to
form the basis for hydrogen-fueled systems. Central to our understanding of biologi-
cal  systems  is  the  enzyme  hydrogenase,  the  catalyst  for  reversible  hydrogen  oxida-
tion.  Hydrogenases  are  components  of  chemically  driven  energy  production  in  mi-
crobes  in  the  absence  of  oxygen.  Understanding  them  using  physical,  genomic  and
biochemical  methods  could  yield  important  information  for  design  of  systems  that
mimic  the  efficiency  of  chemical  and  light  energy  transduction  found  in  biological
systems.  Guided  by  advances  in  theory,  modeling  and  simulation,  the  synthesis  of
‘‘model’’ systems that possess characteristics of hydrogenases represents a promising
complementary approach to this objective.
Q2b. How is NSF-funded research addressing those basic research questions?
A2b. The principal investments of NSF-funded research related to fuel cell and hy-
drogen  themes  are  in  the  following  areas:  1)  mechanisms  of  hydrogen  production
and  utilization  in  microbes  and  cellular  membranes  (Biological  Sciences  and  Geo-
sciences  directorates);  2)  catalysis,  hydrogen  production,  purification  and  storage  of
hydrogen, fuel cell membrane characteristics, and fuel cell design (Engineering and
Mathematical  and  Physical  Sciences  directorates);  3)  experimental  and  theoretical
studies  of  electrode  reactions,  water  clusters,  photo-induced  electron  transfer  reac-
tions,  and  model  hydrogenase  systems  (Mathematical  and  Physical  Sciences  direc-

properties  for  potential  fuel  cell  applications  and  for  sequestration  of  greenhouse
gases  (Mathematical  and  Physical  Sciences).  Some  representative  projects  illus-
trating  how  NSF  PIs  are  addressing  the  research  challenges  outlined  in  section  2a
were given in section 1a.

It should be noted that many of NSF’s investments are made in response to unso-
licited  proposals.  These  may  involve  individual  investigators  or  multi-investigator
teams. The level of investment in hydrogen- and fuel cell-related research, approxi-
mately  $20  M  annually,  reflects  the  strong  interest  in  the  U.S.  academic  scientific
and  engineering  research  community  in  the  basic  research  issues  associated  with
these technologies.

It is also noteworthy that there has been considerable synergy with developments
arising  from  investments  in  nanotechnology.  In  addition  to  the  examples  of  palla-
dium  nanowire  hydrogen  sensors  and  nanoporous  solids  that  can  store  hydrogen,
membranes prepared from multiple nanostructured layers appear to have promising
characteristics with respect to fuel cell usage. Bacteria, which might be regarded as
‘‘nano-machines,’’  have  recently  been  found  to  use  hydrogen  in  extreme  environ-
ments such as hot springs, (http://www.eurekalert.org/pub¥releases/2005-01/uoca-
ymf012405.php. Learning how these organisms live on hydrogen and how they con-
vert  it  to  other  forms  of  energy  may  have  the  potential  for  transformative  discov-
eries upon which to build a hydrogen economy.
Q3a. What hydrogen research is NSF currently funding?
A3a. Areas  of  concentration  are  reflected  in  the  interagency  Hydrogen  R&D  Task
Force  topic  areas.  NSF  is  represented  on  14  teams  focusing  on  catalysis;  materials
for hydrogen storage; materials research; materials performance, measurement, and
analysis;  biological  and  biomimetic  hydrogen  production;  physical  and  chemical
interactions  of  materials  and  hydrogen;  multi-functional  materials  and  structures;
photo-electrochemical  hydrogen  production;  characterization  and  new  synthesis
tools;  hydrogen  internal  combustion  engines;  hydrogen  turbines;  SBIR/STTR;  and
workforce/education.  Currently,  NSF  funds  approximately  130  awards  per  year  in
the areas listed above.
Q3b. How much of this research, if any, is collaborative with private industry?
A3b. The  principal  mechanisms  that  NSF  uses  to  promote  interactions  with  indus-
try are the SBIR/STTR and Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry
(GOALI) programs, although the latter is only a small fraction of the agency’s port-
folio.  Some  individual  investigator  awards  also  have  industrial  collaborations.  NSF
estimates  a  current  investment  of  about  $4  M  in  SBIR/STTR  awards  in  hydrogen-
related  technology.  NSF  and  DOE  established  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding
that offers NSF SBIR/STTR grantees with technology of interest to DOE additional
resources through DOE’s ‘‘Commercialization Assistance Program.’’
Q3c. How  much,  if  any,  is  coordinated  with  the  basic  research  effort  at  the  Depart-

ment of Energy (DOE)?

A3c. There  is  considerable  coordination  with  DOE  in  areas  of  mutual  interest.  For
example,  the  two  agencies  co-chaired  a  session  at  the  National  Hydrogen  Associa-
tion  (NHA)  Annual  National  Hydrogen  Conference  this  past  April  that  focused  on
funding  opportunities  across  agencies  for  the  SBIR/STTR  community.  For  essen-
tially  all  of  the  topic  areas  being  coordinated  by  the  interagency  Hydrogen  R&D
Task  Force  in  which  NSF  participates  (section  3a),  DOE  is  also  represented.  Staff
members  of  these  two  agencies  are  collaborating  in  developing  short  white  papers
describing  the  specific  technical  challenges  associated  with  each  topic  area,  along
with  representatives  from  other  agencies  as  appropriate.  Informal  relationships
have  included  extending  invitations  to  workshops  and  contractors’  meetings,  and
sharing  information  on  program  announcements,  proposals,  and  awards.  The  infor-
mation  that  is  shared  helps  to  ensure  appropriate  partitioning  of  investments  be-
tween  the  targeted,  often  short-time-frame  perspective  of  DOE  and  the  high-risk,
often longer-term perspective of NSF.
Q4a. How does the NSF coordinate with the Office of Science and Technology Policy,
DOE  and  the  other  agencies  involved  with  the  Hydrogen  Interagency  Task
Force?

A4a. The  interagency  Hydrogen  R&D  Task  Force  holds  monthly  meetings  at  the
White  House  Conference  Center.  This  provides  an  excellent  opportunity  to  meet
with  representatives  from  OSTP,  DOE  and  the  other  agencies  involved  with  the
Task  Force.  NSF  currently  has  two  representatives  who  regularly  attend  the  meet-
ings.

Q4b. How  is  this  information  exchanged  between  the  agencies  and  to  what  extent  is

it beneficial to NSF?

A4b. We  have  found  that  the  topic  areas  have  been  effective  in  connecting  staff
members  across  agencies  that  support  research  in  areas  of  common  interest.  Addi-
tionally,  the  Task  Force  established  a  website,  http://www.hydrogen.gov,  that  pro-
vides  information  from  all  of  the  participating  agencies  that  is  of  value  both  to  the
agencies and the external community.
Q4c. How does NSF ensure that its research results are available to other agencies?
A4c. Beyond  the  informal  contacts  of  technical  staff  facilitated  by  the  Task  Force,
the  NSF  has  a  searchable  award  database  and  collects  annual  and  final  reports
from its PIs. All of this information is available to technical staff at other agencies.
NSF  convenes  workshops  on  topics  related  to  the  hydrogen  initiative.  The  Task
Force meetings and contacts provide a mechanism for inviting representatives from
other agencies to participate in the workshops and learn about the latest results of
NSF’s PIs and their thoughts on promising future research and education directions.
Q4d. Is  the  Task  Force  successful  in  helping  agencies  understand  what  hydrogen

issues other agencies are working on, and to what degree?

A4d. Our  experience  has  been  that  the  Task  Force  has  been  quite  successful  thus
far in lowering barriers to interagency collaboration and providing broader perspec-
tives  for  investments  related  to  the  hydrogen  initiative.  Most  meetings  include  up-
dates from agency representatives on the various topical areas, meetings, and work-
shops.  In  addition,  there  have  been  presentations  on  the  International  Partnership
for  the  Hydrogen  Economy  and  on  specific  programs  of  participating  agencies  that
have provided useful information on the scope of the federal investment.

STATEMENT BY MICHELIN NORTH AMERICA

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to

present this testimony today on behalf of Michelin North America.

Since  1889,  Michelin  has  been  contributing  to  progress  in  the  area  of  mobility,
through its expertise in the field of tires and suspension systems and the company’s
willingness to invest in innovation. In a number of instances, Michelin has been the
force  behind  technological  breakthroughs,  such  as  the  radial  tire,  the  ‘‘Green  tire’’
and the X One single wide-based tire.

Michelin  is  the  world  leader  in  the  tire  industry.  We  manufacture  and  sell  tires
for  every  type  of  vehicle,  including  airplanes,  automobiles,  bicycles,  earthmovers,
farm  equipment,  heavy-duty  trucks,  motorcycles,  and  the  Space  Shuttle.  The  com-
pany  also  publishes  travel  guides,  maps  and  atlases  covering  North  America,  Eu-
rope, Asia and Africa. In 2004 Michelin produced nearly 195 million tires and print-
ed 19 million maps and guides. Our net sales totaled approximately $19 billion. Our
tire  activities  and  support  services  account  for  98  percent  of  our  net  sales.  Suspen-
sion systems, mobility assistance services, travel publications and Michelin Lifestyle
products account for the remaining two percent of our total business.

Michelin sells its products in over 170 countries, operates 74 production manufac-
turing  facilities  in  19  countries  and  employs  nearly  127,000  people  around  the
world. Michelin operates three technology centers on three continents, one of which
is  located  in  Greenville,  South  Carolina.  Greenville  is  the  headquarters  of  Michelin
North  America  which  employs  over  23,000  people  and  operates  21  manufacturing
facilities in 17 locations.

Michelin  is  in  the  business  of  sustainable  mobility.  What  does  that  mean?  How
goods and services move has been a fundamental factor in the development of soci-
ety,  as  a  tool  of  discovery  and  a  means  of  communication  and  interaction  between
people.

Roads  have  played  a  key  role  in  the  phenomena  of  urbanization,  globalization  of
exchanges  and,  more  generally,  economic  growth.  Road  mobility  provides  access  to
the world and makes for a more fluid job market, by increasing travel opportunities
to  and  from  our  homes  and  places  of  work.  Roads  provide  those  located  in  areas
away  from  economic  centers  with  a  way  of  bringing  products  to  the  marketplace.
Furthermore,  mobility  is  freedom,  perhaps  one  of  the  most  basic  freedoms  in  any
country.  To  encourage  mobility,  to  support  the  growth  of  infrastructure  and  ease  of
travel  is  to  encourage  freedom  itself.  With  freedom  comes  responsibility—to  travel
safely, to conserve limited resources and to respect the environment.

Alongside  these  advantages,  advances  in  modern  modes  of  transport  have  often
involved  significant  social  and  environmental  impacts.  Transport  worldwide,  and
road  transport  in  particular,  is  currently  developing  in  a  context  of  population
growth,  urban  development  and  an  increasing  awareness  of  the  impact  of  human
activity  on  the  environment.  In  light  of  these  factors,  a  transition  towards  a  new
attitude  to  mobility  is  clearly  needed.  Sustainable  mobility  takes  into  account  the
necessity  of  providing  satisfactory  responses  to  travel  requirements.  It  must  also
move  toward  a  reduction  in  the  impact  of  mobility  on  the  environment,  become  ac-
cessible to more people in as safe a manner as possible and be compatible with the
economic  objectives  and  constraints  of  public  authorities,  private  companies  and
non-governmental organizations.

Michelin  views  this  concept  of  sustainable  mobility  as  being  in  concert  with  our
five  core  values:  respect  for  customers,  respect  for  facts,  respect  for  people,  respect
for  shareholders  and  respect  for  the  environment.  These  values,  and  how  we  con-
cretely  translate  these  values  to  executable  actions,  are  articulated  in  Michelin’s
Performance and Responsibility Charter and subsequent Performance and Responsi-
bility reports.

Why is the notion of sustainable mobility important? Between 1950 and 2003, the
number of vehicles on the roads throughout the world went from 50 million to more
than  830  million,  including  nearly  700  million  cars.  According  to  the  projections  of
the  World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development  (WBCSD),  the  number  of
passenger vehicles on the roads throughout the world will reach 1.3 billion in 2030.
The  distances  traveled  by  people  will  increase  by  nearly  50  percent  between  2000
and  2030.  Over  the  same  period  of  time,  truck  freight  is  forecast  to  increase  by  75
percent.

As stated earlier, this increase in road traffic has an impact on the environment.
Transport  represents  26  percent  of  carbon  dioxide  emission  (17  percent  for  road
transport,  nine  percent  for  other  modes  of  transport)  according  to  the  International
Energy Agency. In industrialized countries, transport consumes about 65 percent of
oil resources.

joined  with  11  other  corporate  members  of 

In  2000,  as  a  way  of  responding  to  the  consequences  of  increased  mobility,
Michelin 
the  WBCSD—BP,
DaimlerChrysler,  Ford,  General  Motors,  Honda,  Nissan,  Norsk  Hydro,  Renault,
Shell,  Toyota  and  Volkswagen—to  establish  the  Sustainable  Mobility  Project.  The
goal of this group was to carry out an assessment of mobility throughout the world,
analyze the challenges facing the sector and identify the directions to take in order
to address these challenges.

Even before participating in the Sustainable Mobility Project, Michelin recognized
the  necessity  of  addressing  the  impacts  of  rapidly  increasing  road  transport.  In
1998, for the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of Bibendum—Michelin’s cor-
porate  icon  known  around  the  world  as  the  ‘‘Michelin  Man’’—Michelin  organized  a
rally  of  advanced  technology  vehicles.  Challenge  Bibendum  has  won  worldwide  rec-
ognition  as  the  premier  clean  and  safe  vehicle  event  in  the  world,  where  industry,
policy-makers  and  experts  can  review  the  latest  technologies  and  share  their  vi-
sions. The event provides the opportunity to evaluate different technical options that
exist  to  tackle  the  energy,  environmental  and  safety  issues  associated  with  freight
and  individual  mobility  worldwide.  This  event  has  taken  place  in  Europe,  in  North
America and, last year for the first time, in Asia.

Challenge Bibendum is a mechanism that assists in resolving questions associated
with  emissions,  oil  consumption,  urban  congestion  and  road  safety.  It  is  a  unique
event for several reasons:

teria relating to performance, safety and the environment.

No other event is solution-neutral in both concept and competition.

public and private sectors can freely exchange opinions.

Challenge Bibendum provides an international platform for road vehicle manufac-
turers  to  demonstrate  state-of-the-art  technologies  and  for  participants  to  witness,
assess  and  document  the  progress  which  these  advanced,  real-world  technologies
continue to make, as well as showcase the opportunities they represent.

This event, unlike any other in the world, serves as a testing ground and the only
one  that  showcases  concept  cars  featuring  technologies,  often  for  the  first  time,
alongside production vehicles that have already made very significant progress. Fur-
thermore,  Challenge  Bibendum  serves  as  an  exchange  forum  for  industry  leaders,
university researchers, public policy-makers and the media.

Representatives from numerous organizations from around the world, such as the
U.S.  Department  of  Energy,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  the  World
Bank,  the  European  Commission,  Japan’s  Ministry  of  Land,  Infrastructure  and
Transport  and  the  WBCSD  attended  the  2004  event  in  Shanghai,  China.  In  all,
2,000 people, representing more than 200 organizations from 45 countries, gathered
at the 2004 Challenge Bibendum.

What conclusions could one draw from the 2004 Challenge Bibendum and the fol-
low-on  Bibendum  Forum  and  Rally  held  in  Japan  just  last  month?  First,  there  is
no  single  technology,  device,  or  component  that  resolves  the  question  of  how  to
achieve  sustainable  mobility  within  the  parameters  we  have  constructed.  The  fact
that  Challenge  Bibendum  is  an  event  that  displays  multiple  technologies  under-
scores  the  fact  that  many  of  those  technologies  will  help  us  attain  the  goal  of  sus-
tainable mobility. A more holistic view needs to be taken as we move forward. Like-
wise, when environmental impact issues are examined, it is appropriate to view the
consequences of transport from a ‘‘well to wheel’’ perspective. The environmental im-
pact to gather, refine or otherwise provide the energy to the vehicle from its source
must be taken into consideration.

From the standpoint of technology, the 2004 Challenge Bibendum revealed the fol-

lowing:

• The future will include a variety of technologies and non-petroleum fuels.
• Advanced  internal  combustion  engines,  both  diesel  and  gasoline,  continue  to
make  outstanding  progress  in  terms  of  cleaner  combustion,  more  power  den-
sity, less noise and less energy consumption.

• Urban  pollution  can  be  tackled  through  sulfur  free  fuels,  particulate  filters,
next-generation  combustion  engines  and  exhaust  gas  treatments,  as  well  as
the progressive development of electric traction.
• Hybridization  brings  both  great  driving  performance  and  environmental  effi-
ciency,  especially  for  higher  power  and  larger  size  vehicles;  it  opens  a  wide
array of technical solutions.

• Biofuels offer a very significant potential to help reduce CO2 emissions.
• New  generation  batteries  offer  much  greater  promise  for  electric  traction  of
two-wheelers,  cars,  taxis,  buses,  by  providing  higher  power  and  energy  den-
sities—a range of more than 200 miles is now a reality.

Michelin  looks  forward  to  hosting  the  next  Challenge  Bibendum  (June  2006)  in
order  to  measure  additional  progress.  Until  then,  Michelin  remains  committed  to
improving mobility and reducing as much as possible the impact of its activities and
products on the environment.
