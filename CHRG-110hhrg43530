HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Biobanking: How the Lack of

a Coherent Policy Allowed

the Veterans Administration to

Destroy an Irreplaceable Collection

of Legionella Samples

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2008

10:00 A.M.–2:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  December  4,  2006,  a  set  of  biological  materials  that  was  a  primary  support
for work on Legionella, the bacterium causing Legionnaire’s Disease, was destroyed
at  the  Veterans  Administration  (VA)  Medical  Center  in  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.
This occurred even as the process to transfer the collection to a University of Pitts-
burgh laboratory for further use in research was underway. It was also the last act
of  an  acrimonious  process  that  had  seen  the  closure  of  its  host,  the  Special  Patho-
gens  Laboratory  (SPL),  some  four  months  earlier.  The  closure  of  this  lab  puts  all
hospital  patients,  especially  the  elderly,  severely  sick  children—all  those  with  com-
promised immune systems—at greater risk because this was one of the top hospital
infection laboratories in the Nation.

The purpose of this hearing is to make public the findings of a Subcommittee in-
vestigation  of  this  case.  The  Subcommittee’s  findings  highlight  the  need  for  im-
proved policies on biospecimen management.

Witnesses

Panel I
Dr. Victor Yu, Professor of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh
Dr. Janet Stout, Director, Special Pathogens Laboratory

The  collection  of  materials  destroyed  at  Pittsburgh  was  the  work  of  Doctors  Yu
and  Stout,  who  have,  during  the  last  three  decades,  become  world-recognized  ex-
perts  in  identifying  Legionnaire’s  Disease.  Dr.  Stout  is  widely  recognized  for  her
work  in  developing  methods  to  keep  Legionella  out  of  water  supplies  at  hospitals
and  nursing  homes.  Dr.  Yu  has  an  international  reputation  for  his  work  on  infec-
tious  diseases  in  hospitals,  of  which  Legionnaires’  Disease  is  a  common  type.  Dr.
Stout  had  a  meeting  scheduled  the  morning  after  the  destruction  of  the  collection
(December  5,  2006)  to  remove  personal  identifying  data  from  the  specimens,  a  nec-
essary step prior in the transfer process.
Dr.  David  Snydman,  Chief,  Division  of  Geographic  Medicine  and  Infectious  Dis-
eases, and Attending Physician in Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Tufts
Medical Center

Dr. Snydman has collaborated with Dr. Yu on infectious disease research, and will
provide an expert perspective on the value of the lost materials. He was also instru-
mental in bringing the loss of the collection to the attention of the scientific commu-
nity,  and  calling  for  an  independent  review  of  the  actions  by  administrators  at  the
Veterans Administration Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS).

Panel II
Dr.  Jim  Vaught,  Deputy  Director,  Office  of  Biorepositories  and  Biospecimen  Re-
search, National Cancer Institute (NCI)

Dr. Vaught has been directly involved in the development of biospecimen manage-
ment  policies  in  his  position  at  the  NCI,  helping  to  develop  the  ‘‘best  practices’’
guide  published  by  the  Institute  in  June  2007.  He  was  assigned  to  the  task  force
that assisted in a review and update of National Institutes of Health (NIH) policies
in  2006.  He  has  also  been  participating  as  an  NIH  representative  on  an  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy  working  group  on  scientific  collections  that  is  fin-
ishing a draft report on the state of all federal scientific collections.
Dr.  Janet  K.A.  Nicholson,  Senior  Advisor  for  Laboratory  Science,  Coordinating
Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

CDC  is  a  federal  agency  that  faces  questions  of  biospecimen  management  con-
stantly, as the collection of those materials is critical to the identification of disease.
Dr. Nicholson will testify on her agency’s methods for dealing with the issues raised
by the collection and proper management of biospecimens. She will also discuss the
policies governing operations at the CDC’s major central repository, CASPIR.

Panel III
Michael  Moreland,  Director,  Veterans  Integrated  Services  Network  4,  Department
of Veterans Affairs

At  the  time  the  collection  was  destroyed,  Mr.  Moreland  was  the  Director  of  the
VAPHS  (he  was  in  the  process  of  being  promoted  to  lead  the  VA’s  regional  office).
Mr. Moreland oversaw the decision to close the SPL and instituted a Board of Inves-
tigation  to  examine  allegations  of  financial  impropriety  against  Dr.  Yu.  He  is  al-
leged, though there is no written record, to have personally ordered the destruction
of the collection.
Dr.  Mona  Melhem,  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  and  Vice  President,  VAPHS  Clinical
Support Service Line

Dr.  Melham  supervises  the  clinical  activities  at  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Healthcare
System,  which  include  the  Clinical  Microbiology  Laboratory  at  the  hospital.  It  was
Dr. Melhem’s direct order that led to the abrupt destruction of the collection at the
Special Pathogens Laboratory on December 4, 2006.
Dr. Ali Sonel, VAPHS Associate Chief of Staff (Research)

In  his  position,  Dr.  Sonel  is  responsible  for  the  management  and  conduct  of  re-
search  by  staff  at  VAPHS.  Dr.  Sonel  assumed  the  position  on  September  1,  2006,
soon after the SPL was closed. He was overseeing efforts to assist Dr. Stout to move
the collection from the SPL to the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genet-
ics of the School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh when the collection was
destroyed without his knowledge.
Dr.  Steven  Graham,  Director,  VAPHS  Geriatric  Research,  Education  and  Clinical
Centers

Dr. Graham preceded Dr. Sonel as head of research at VAPHS, and was involved
in  the  process  that  led  to  SPL’s  closure.  He  served  as  a  member  of  the  Board  of
Investigation convened by Mr. Moreland. He was cited by Dr. Melhem as having ap-
proved the destruction of the collection, but has denied it.
Ms. Cheryl Wanzie, VAPHS Chief Technologist

Ms.  Wanzie  supervises  the  technical  operations  of  the  VAPHS  Clinical  Microbi-
ology Laboratory. She was one of those receiving Dr. Melhem’s order to destroy the
collection  on  December  4,  and  was  in  the  Laboratory  as  the  freezers  were  emptied
into biohazard bags.

Background

On  December  4,  2006,  employees  of  the  VAPHS’  clinical  microbiology  laboratory,
were  ordered  to  destroy  the  collection  of  Legionella  and  other  disease  isolates  and
also  water  samples  containing  the  Legionella  bacteria  that  had  been  accumulated
by  Dr.  Yu  and  Dr.  Stout  over  the  decades  of  their  research  on  this  disease.  The
order  was  given  by  Dr.  Melhem  at  the  same  time  Dr.  Sonel  was  actively  working
to  transfer  the  collection  to  a  laboratory  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  for  use  in
further research by Dr. Yu and Dr. Stout.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 18:28 Dec 27, 2008 Jkt 043530 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O08\090908\43530 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

5

At  that  time,  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  had  been  closed  for  almost  five

months, and Dr. Yu was no longer with the VAPHS.

The  destruction  took  place  outside  of  any  previous  process  that  had  been  used  to
determine  the  disposition  of  biospecimens  left  behind  by  former  researchers  and
without  the  knowledge  of  Dr.  Sonel  or  the  Research  Compliance  Committee,  which
would  normally  been  involved.  The  collection  was  the  life’s  work  of  Dr.  Yu  and  Dr.
Stout,  and  no  one  from  the  VAPHS  has  been  able  to  provide  a  credible  reason  for
such a precipitous act.

Building the Better Biobank

Collections  such  as  the  Legionella  collection  are  more  and  more  common  as  re-
searchers study the evolution of both disease strains and treatment. The improving
capability  of  tools  for  biological  analysis  is  allowing  researchers  to  make  greater
strides  in  understanding  the  workings  of  human  biology  at  ever  finer  detail.  Cou-
pled with ever more powerful computers, this allows studying amounts of data that
could never have been contemplated in the past. With the completion of the ‘‘draft’’
of  the  human  genome,  so-called  ‘‘personalized  medicine’’  appeared  on  the  horizon:
medical treatments could be devised to meet a patient’s unique condition.

These  changes  are  reflected  in  the  development  of  biobanks:  places  where  tradi-
tional human biospecimens such as blood and tissue are matched to databases with
medical  records,  genomic  sequence  data  and  other  information.  Bringing  these  to-
gether  helps  with  the  identification  of  disease-causing  genes  or  genetic  variants.  It
can find connections between outbreaks of infection and factors in the environment.
Targets for new therapies can be found. The SPL collection was something of a pro-
totype  biobank,  and  much  of  its  value  resided  in  the  ability  to  match  a  particular
biospecimen to its clinical history. That the collection included biospecimens extend-
ing back more than two decades also allowed comparative study to learn how orga-
nisms were changing in response to efforts to control or eradicate them.

One of the principal values of a properly-run biobank is the control of quality, al-
lowing  researchers  to  be  confident  that  the  information  they  use  (and  the  results
they obtain) are accurate. This requires rigorous control over biospecimens from the
moment of collection and equally careful handling of the patient-specific medical in-
formation associated with it. Today’s hearing is concerned, not just with the events
at  the  VAPHS,  but  with  the  collection  management  policy  aspects  related  to  the
physical biospecimens.

The Federal Government has supported, either with work at agencies like the Na-
tional Institutes or Health the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or by ex-
ternal research grants, the collection of millions of biospecimens. Many are in freez-
ers  in  thousands  of  disparate  laboratories,  mostly  of  interest  to  a  particular  re-
searcher for a specific project. It is not easy to find firm policy governing these valu-
able  materials.  The  loss  of  the  SPL  collection,  where  materials  of  continuing  sci-
entific  value  were  destroyed  on  the  order  of  just  one  person,  highlights  the  need  to
bring greater discipline to biospecimen management.

There have been scattered efforts to address the need for improved policies in bio-
specimen  management.  The  hearing  today  will  discuss  efforts  at  NIH  and  CDC  to
update  their  policies  to  serve  as  models  for  discussion.  This  includes  the  question
of destroying materials; while no scientist likes to lose a piece of data, it sometimes
is  necessary  when  freezers  fill  up  or  the  collection’s  champion  retires  and  no  one
is interested in carrying on that line of work. Best practice today argues that efforts
should be made to find an alternative home for those materials, a process that had
been  successfully  underway  with  the  SPL  Legionella  collection.  It  also  expects  that
there will be some evaluation of the continuing value of the materials before decid-
ing  on  destruction.  The  biospecimens  at  the  heart  of  tomorrow’s  biobanks  need  ro-
bust protection, unlike the fate of SPL’s collection.

The SPL Environment

The  1976  outbreak  of  Legionnaires’  Disease  at  the  Philadelphia  American  Legion
convention  immediately  raised  concerns  at  the  Veterans  Administration,  as  it  at-
tacked  precisely  the  same  populations  in  VA  hospitals  across  the  country.  VAPHS
did  much  to  lead  the  effort  to  find  out  about  the  disease.  The  Clinical  Microbiology
Laboratory found a way to grow Legionella bacteria in laboratories, and Doctors Yu
and  Stout  traced  the  source  of  infection  to  water  systems.  The  Special  Pathogens
Laboratory  was  originally  established  as  a  focus  for  continued  Legionella  studies
and  testing  for  both  VA  and  non-VA  health  care  facilities.  The  work  of  Doctors  Yu
and Stout figured prominently in a review of Legionnaires’ Disease risk at VA facili-
ties  by  the  Department’s  Inspector  General  last  year  and  the  institution  of  a  new
protocol.

SPL’s expertise was shared with other VA facilities and outside entities. Although
initially  funded  by  the  VA’s  central  office,  in  keeping  with  VA  policy  in  the  mid-
1990s, Dr. Yu proposed to recover testing costs by billing for services. This was ap-
proved,  and  the  billing  system  was  set  up  through  the  Veterans  Research  Founda-
tion of Pittsburgh. Congress had allowed the creation of these non-profit entities to
manage  outside  contributions  for  research  at  VA  facilities.  The  revenues  were  used
to pay the salaries of Lab employees (except for Dr. Stout, who was a VA microbiolo-
gist).  By  the  time  the  SPL  was  closed,  it  was  billing  about  $500,000  per  year.  For
the  most  part,  so  far  as  documents  show,  there  was  little  concern  about  the  Lab’s
activities at the Foundation until 2006.

While  the  decision  to  close  the  SPL  is  not  the  focus  of  this  hearing,  it  cannot  be
completely  divorced  from  the  discussion.  The  chaotic  events  of  July  2006,  during
which Dr. Yu was told to close the lab in two days, then received a 10-day extension,
after  which  the  doors  were  locked  and  access  denied,  confused  the  status  of  the
Legionella collection. It became clear that there were gaps in the system of research
oversight  at  the  VAPHS.  Some  administrators  assert,  based  on  incomplete,  largely
post-hoc  investigations,  that  these  biospecimens  were  not  collected  as  part  of  ap-
proved research protocols, nor were they properly maintained and identified—there-
fore  they  had  no  scientific  value  despite  their  role  in  numerous  peer-reviewed  arti-
cles and VA’s treatment practices. Doctors Yu and Stout firmly state that they had
appropriate approvals and that the collection was properly cataloged.

But what is evident is that the research structure at the VAPHS—which was sup-
posed to have been in charge of the collection, had opposed its destruction and was
ready  to  transfer  it  to  Dr.  Yu—was  deliberately  kept  out  of  the  loop.  What  is  also
evident  is  that  administrators  at  a  major  VA  hospital  system  had  allowed  personal
animosities  and  goals  to  overcome  its  own  processes.  No  federal  health  facility
should be allowed to function in this manner. A Subcommittee staff report describes
the situation in greater detail.

Chairman  MILLER.  Good  morning.  This  hearing  will  come  to
order. Today’s hearing is ‘‘Biobanking: How the Lack of a Coherent
Policy Allowed the Veterans Administration to Destroy an Irreplace-
able Collection of Legionella Samples.’’

The Subcommittee staff for the Investigation and Oversight Sub-
committee  conducted  an  extensive  investigation  into  the  handling
of an irreplaceable collection of Legionella samples at the Veterans
Affairs  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  Clinic.  The  purpose  of  this  hearing
is  to  make  public  the  findings  of  the  Subcommittee’s  investigation
into this case and to highlight the need for a uniform national pol-
icy on biospecimen management.

On December 4, 2006, late in the afternoon, two employees of the
clinical  microbiology  laboratory  at  the  Veterans  Affairs  Pittsburgh
Healthcare Clinic, the VAPHS, were ordered by Dr. Mona Melhem,
the  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  for  Clinical  Services,  to  go  to  the  Spe-
cial  Pathogens  Laboratory  and  destroy  the  research  collection  of
Dr.  Victor  Yu  and  Dr.  Janet  Stout.  Dr.  Melhem  said  her  orders
came from Michael Moreland, then the system’s Director.

The  two  employees  commandeered  the  help  of  three  other  em-
ployees,  and  within  three  hours  a  collection  that  had  taken  three
decades to build was gone. Drs. Yu and Stout are international ex-
perts  in  the  detection,  treatment  and  control  of  Legionella,  a  bac-
terium that causes a kind of severe pneumonia called Legionnaires’
disease, and their laboratory was internationally acclaimed. Dr. Yu
was  known  for  his  work  on  other  infectious  pneumonias  and  anti-
microbial  resistance.  According  to  Dr.  David  Snydman  of  Tufts
Medical Center, one of our witnesses today, this collection was used
to  develop  new  diagnostic  tests  and  therapies  and  to  study  resist-
ance and mechanisms of disease transmission.

The destruction of the research collection was the culmination of
an acrimonious series of events that included the closing of the na-
tionally  acclaimed  laboratory,  the  firing  of  Dr.  Yu  and  the  at-
tempted firing of Dr. Stout.

As  an  impartial  audience—there  is  no  real  partisanship  to  any
of this—the most troubling part of the story is that the destruction
of this one-of-a-kind collection occurred less than an hour after Dr.
Melhem  learned  that  formal  steps  were  being  taken  the  following
day to transfer the collection to the University of Pittsburgh, where
Drs.  Yu  and  Stout  were  then  affiliated  so  their  research  could  go
on, and the destruction of this collection occurred after Dr. Melhem
made a false statement to the system’s Chief of Staff and the head
of  the  research  office  telling  him  that  the  collection  could  not  be
transferred because it had already been destroyed on the orders of
the  medical  center’s  Director.  That  false  statement  kept  the  head
of the research office from effectively intervening to try to save the
collection.

Months  of  investigation  by  the  Subcommittee  have  not  revealed
any  credible  reason  for  the  destruction  of  the  collection.  Dr.
Melhem  said  that  a  former  research  official  had  approved  the  de-
struction  months  before.  That  official  denies  giving  such  approval.
She  also  claims  that  the  decision  was  made  in  July  without  ever
informing  Dr.  Stout  or  Dr.  Yu,  both  of  whom  were  then  still  on
staff.  Dr.  Moreland  can’t  remember  giving  her  such  orders  on  De-
cember  4  and  seems  unclear  about  his  understanding  of  the  dif-

ference between the research specimens that we are concerned with
today and clinical specimens that were being processed by the lab-
oratory  on  the  day  that  it  closed.  Both  Dr.  Melhem  and  Mr.
Moreland  are  now  taking  the  position  that  the  collection  wasn’t
really  a  research  collection  and  did  not  have  to  be  preserved.  This
is despite the fact that dozens of peer review papers have come out
of the laboratory in its 25 years of existence, and statements made
to  Dr.  Yu  that  he  would  be  able  to  continue  his  research,  even  if
the lab closed.

Mr.  Moreland’s  testimony  came  in  late  yesterday.  The  Sub-
committee  has  made  two  very  comprehensive  document  requests
concerning the closure of the Special Pathogens Laboratory and the
destruction  of  its  research  collection,  and  we  received  many  docu-
ments,  voluminous  documents,  but  in  his  testimony,  Mr.  Moreland
refers  to  a  technical  review  regarding  biohazards  at  the  lab,  dis-
posal  acts  done  in  July  of  2006,  and  a  December  2006  determina-
tion that not a single one of the samples in question were collected,
or was collected, as part of any previously approved research effort.
The  Committee  has  never  received  any  documentation  of  any  of
those  assertions.  Either  they  do  not  exist,  the  documents  do  not
exist,  or  they  have  not  been  provided,  but  in  any  case,  the  testi-
mony is very troubling.

Mr.  Moreland  and  other  witnesses  from  the  Pittsburgh  VA
should  remember  that  their  testimony  today  is  under  oath  and  it
is simply not credible that important technical decisions were made
entirely based upon conversations with no documentation.

I cannot imagine the circumstances under which a federal health
agency official would unilaterally order the destruction of a human
tissue  collection  without  receiving  the  approval  of  the  agency’s  re-
search  office  and  the  Research  Compliance  Committee.  I  cannot
imagine  why  that  official  would  apparently  make  false  statements
during  the  destruction  to  keep  the  associate  director  for  research
at  the  center  in  the  dark  until  the  destruction  was  complete.  It
stuns  me  that  in  the  time  since  those  actions,  neither  Pittsburgh
nor national VA officials have taken formal action to discipline the
managers  involved  in  this  case  or  establish  clear  policy  on  the  de-
struction of biomedical collections to make sure that this will never
happen again.

All  of  us  may  pay  a  price  for  this  conduct,  veterans  most  of  all,
because the Nation lost one of its leading research labs on hospital
infectious  diseases,  and  while  the  researchers  can  relocate  and
start  their  work  again,  the  research  samples  can  never  be  wholly
reconstituted. Those who are in hospitals, the elderly, severely sick
children  or  anyone  else  with  compromised  immune  systems  are
those most at risk.

The  work  of  Dr.  Yu  and  Dr.  Stout  cannot  be  recovered  entirely.
However,  we  can  protect  the  work  of  thousands  of  other  profes-
sionals at the VA and other federal agencies or institutions that re-
sult  in  the  collection  of  biological  samples,  biological  collections
funded  by  taxpayer  money.  Those  collections  should  not  be  subject
to similar mishandling simply at the caprice of a powerful adminis-
trator. It is time for the Office of Science and Technology Policy to
start  an  interagency  effort  to  create  a  core  set  of  policies  for  the

handling, maintenance and disposition of such specimens, and I do
intend to introduce that legislation shortly.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Miller follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRAD MILLER

The Subcommittee staff of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight con-
ducted  an  extensive  investigation  into  the  handling  of  an  irreplaceable  collection  of
Legionella samples at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System. The pur-
pose  of  this  hearing  is  to  make  public  the  findings  of  the  Subcommittee  investiga-
tion of this case and to highlight the need for a national uniform policy on biospeci-
men management.

On December 4, 2006—late in the afternoon—two employees of the clinical micro-
biology  laboratory  at  the  Veterans  Affairs  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  (VAPHS)
were ordered by Dr. Mona Melhem, the Associate Chief of Staff for clinical services,
to go to the Special Pathogens Laboratory and destroy the research collection of Dr.
Victor  Yu  and  Dr.  Janet  Stout.  Dr.  Melhem  said  her  orders  came  from  Michael
Moreland, then the system’s Director.

The  two  employees  joined  by  three  others  took  less  than  three  hours  to  bag  up
a biomedical sample collection that represented almost three decades of research by
Dr’s  Yu  and  Stout.  It  was  bagged,  burned  and  gone.  Drs.  Yu  and  Stout  are  inter-
national  experts  in  the  detection,  treatment  and  control  of  Legionella,  a  bacterium
which causes a type of severe pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease, and their lab-
oratory was internationally acclaimed. Dr. Yu was also known for his work on other
infectious  pneumonias  and  antimicrobial  resistance.  According  to  Dr.  David
Snydman  of  Tufts  Medical  Center  and  one  of  our  witnesses  today,  this  collection
was used to develop new diagnostic tests and therapies and to study resistance and
mechanisms of disease transmission.

The  destruction  of  the  research  collection  was  the  culmination  of  an  acrimonious
series of events that included the closing of the nationally acclaimed laboratory, the
firing  of  Dr.  Yu,  the  system’s  long-time  Chief  of  Infectious  Disease,  and  the  at-
tempted firing of Dr. Stout.

As an impartial audience, the most troubling part of this story is that the destruc-
tion  of  this  one-of-a-kind  collection  occurred  less  than  an  hour  after  Dr.  Melhem
learned  that  formal  steps  were  being  taken,  on  the  following  day,  to  transfer  the
collection  to  the  University  of  Pittsburgh,  where  Drs.  Yu  and  Stout  were  affiliated.
And the destruction of this collection occurred after Dr. Melhem made a false state-
ment to the system’s Chief of Staff and the head of the research office, telling them
that  the  collection  could  not  be  transferred  because  it  had  already  been  destroyed
on  the  orders  of  the  medical  center’s  Director.  That  false  statement  kept  the  head
of the Research Office from effectively intervening to try to save the collection.

I  will  leave  many  details  to  my  written  statement,  but  summarize  by  saying
months of investigation by the Subcommittee have not revealed any credible reason
for  this  rash  and  malicious  act.  Dr.  Melhem  says  she  received  direction  to  destroy
the  collection;  the  people  she  cites  deny  it  or  don’t  recall  doing  so.  There  is  a  claim
this  isn’t  ‘‘research’’  collection,  despite  the  fact  that  dozens  of  peer-reviewed  papers
have  come  out  of  the  laboratory  in  its  25  years  of  existence,  and  statements  made
to  Dr.  Yu  in  July  that  he  would  be  able  to  continue  his  research  even  if  the  lab
closed.

The policies for collection management at the Pittsburgh VA—and perhaps the en-
tire VA system—are unclear, and the organizations in place to oversee research ap-
pear  to  have  been  short-circuited.  We  also  found  that  there  were  years  of  neglect
by  the  board  of  the  Veterans  Research  Foundation  of  Pittsburgh,  which  was  han-
dling  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory’s  funds,  but  paid  little  attention  to  it  until
a  few  months  before  its  abrupt  decision  to  close  the  lab.  The  institutional  failure
to  establish  and  follow  clear  procedures  spilled  over  into  the  decision-making  proc-
ess for closing the lab. It appeared that the most important thing to the Pittsburgh
VA  hierarchy  in  the  summer  of  2006  was  to  close  the  lab  and  rid  itself  of  Dr.  Yu
and Dr. Stout by whatever means necessary.

I want to make one comment about Mr. Moreland’s testimony which came in late
yesterday. The Subcommittee has made two very comprehensive document requests
concerning the closure of the Special Pathogen Laboratory and the destruction of its
research  collection,  and  we  have  received  many  documents.  Yet  in  his  testimony,
Mr.  Moreland  makes  reference  to  a  ‘‘technical’’  review  regarding  biohazards  at  the
lab;  disposal  acts  done  in  July  of  2006;  and  a  December  2006  ‘‘determination’’  that
not a single one of the samples in question were collected as part of any previously
approved research efforts. The Subcommittee has never received any documentation

of any of these claims. Either they do not exist or they have not been provided, but
either way, this testimony is very troubling.

Mr. Moreland and other witnesses from the Pittsburgh VA should remember that
they are giving their testimony under oath. The Subcommittee will take it very seri-
ously if they cannot provide documentation of their statements.

Scientists from several other agencies and institutions have been contacted by the
Committee staff and, while their own policies may be based more on habit and com-
mon  sense  than  actual  guidance,  all  of  them  indicated  that  such  an  act  would  not
have occurred in their agency. A much more common practice is to determine if any
other  researchers  at  the  institution  are  interested  in  the  collection  and,  if  not,  ask
the  departing  researcher  if  he  or  she  wants  to  take  the  collection.  If  no  one  wants
the collection and its long-term value to the originating institution is deemed mini-
mal, it may be offered to outside researchers who have worked in the field. If there
is  absolutely  no  interest,  the  collection  is  destroyed.  The  Pittsburgh  VA’s  actions
were  so  out  of  the  norm  that  more  than  200  infectious  disease  researchers  have
called for an independent investigation.

I  cannot  imagine  the  circumstances  under  which  a  federal  health  agency  official
would unilaterally order the destruction of a human tissue collection without receiv-
ing  the  approval  of  the  agency’s  research  office  and  the  Research  Compliance  Com-
mittee. I cannot imagine why that official would, apparently, make false statements
during  the  destruction  to  make  it  keep  the  Associate  Director  for  Research  at  the
Center in the dark until the destruction was complete. It disappoints me that in the
time since those actions, neither Pittsburgh nor national VA officials have taken for-
mal  action  to  discipline  the  managers  involved  in  this  case  or  establish  clear  policy
on the disposition of biomedical collections to make sure that this could never occur
again.

The  work  of  Dr.  Yu  and  Dr.  Stout  cannot  be  recovered.  However,  we  can  protect
the  work  of  thousands  of  other  professionals  at  the  VA  and  other  federal  agencies
or  institutions  that  result  in  the  collection  of  biological  collections  funded  by  tax-
payer money. These collections should not be subject to similar mishandling simply
because  they  run  afoul  of  a  powerful  administrator.  It  is  time  for  the  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy  to  start  an  interagency  effort  to  create  a  core  set  of
policies  for  the  handling,  maintenance  and  disposition  of  such  specimens.  I  intend
to introduce that legislation shortly.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  now  yield  to  my  distinguished  colleague,

Representative Rohrabacher, for an opening statement.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  and
I  am  sorry  that  I  have  a  bit  of  a  cold  today.  Maybe  I  could  seek
advice  from  the  panel  on  what  to  do.  If  you  have  one  of  those
things to cover my face, that might be an appropriate situation.

So often here in Washington, D.C., when we take a look at a seri-
ous  problem,  we  find  that  politics  and  bureaucracy  has  really
screwed  things  up,  and  this  may  or  may  not  be  the  case  here.  In
this  case,  we  might  be  looking  at  a  situation  where  individuals
were  wrong.  People  who  held  power  made  wrong  decisions,  and
people  who  make  wrong  decisions  should  be  held  accountable  or  it
will  not  encourage  other  people  who  hold  positions  of  authority  to
take  their  job  as  seriously  as  their  jobs  dictate.  If  it’s  not  an  indi-
vidual flaw or a situation where we have a situation where an indi-
vidual has made wrong decisions, we may find in this case that the
system itself is flawed.

I  want  to  congratulate  the  Chairman  for  the  work  he  has  done
on  this  issue  to  see  if  we  can  come  down  to  find  out  exactly  what
is  at  the  heart  of  this  issue  and  what  caused  this  to  happen  and
what can be done to correct the situation. We need to hear the de-
tails  to  see  if  it  is  a  flaw  in  the  system,  if  it  can  be  corrected,  and
if  it  is  a  personnel  situation  where  bad  decisions  were  made  for
whatever reason, that those people are held accountable. Our policy
on  biobank  issues  certainly  deserves  our  attention  in  relation  to
looking over this particular issue.

I would suggest that we should be very careful, however, to make
sure  that  when  we  are  proposing  changes  or  what  should  be  the
reaction  of  the  government  to  this  incident  that  we  be  careful  not
to introduce politics and bureaucracy in a negative way into a sys-
tem  that  may  well  be  making  mistakes  because  people  within  the
system just made flawed decisions. Maybe people were kept in posi-
tions of authority for too long, maybe perhaps a situation where the
people  themselves  did  not  have  the  proper  oversight,  so  we  really
have  to  take  a  look  where  an  individual,  he  or  she  did  something
wrong  but  we  can’t  use  that  as  an  excuse  to  alter  the  system  in
a  way  that  might  make  it  less  effective  in  the  future  if  we  haven’t
targeted the reforms in the right way.

So  I  am  very  open-minded  to  this,  and  if  we  can  make  it  better,
we will, and as the Chairman stated, there is no politics in a situa-
tion  like  this.  We  work  together  to  try  to  see  what  we  can  come
up with that will correct a flawed situation or hold people account-
able for the decisions they have made.

With  that,  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward

to the hearing.

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Rohrabacher.
Any  additional  opening  statements  submitted  by  Members  will

be included in the record.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Mr.  Chairman,  the  flippant  destruction  of  a  biobank  of  Legionella  concerns  me

greatly, as a nurse.

As you may know, this bacterium causes a serious lung infection. It was so named
in  1976  when  many  people  attending  a  convention  of  the  American  Legion  became
sickened by it.

The Centers for Disease Control report that between 8,000 and 18,000 people are
hospitalized each year with Legionnaires’ disease in the United States. Elderly peo-
ple are especially vulnerable to it.

Legionnaires’ disease can have symptoms like many other forms of pneumonia, so
it  can  be  hard  to  diagnose  at  first.  Signs  of  the  disease  can  include:  a  high  fever,
chills, and a cough.

The  disease  can  be  very  serious  and  can  cause  death  in  up  to  five  percent  to  30

percent of cases.

The Legionella bacteria are found naturally in the environment, usually in water.
The  bacteria  grow  best  in  warm  water,  like  the  kind  found  in  hot  tubs,  cooling
towers,  hot  water  tanks,  large  plumbing  systems,  or  parts  of  the  air-conditioning
systems of large buildings.

People  get  Legionnaires’  disease  when  they  breathe  in  a  mist  or  vapor  (small

droplets of water in the air) that has been contaminated with the bacteria.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  understand  that  in  2006,  a  set  of  biological  specimens  was  de-
stroyed at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
This  represented  a  hostile  act  that  was  part  of  the  shut-down  of  the  lab  at  the

The  collection  was  intended  to  be  transferred  to  the  University  of  Pittsburgh,  so

that important research on Legionnaire’s disease could continue.

This recklessness is a disservice to the American public and is an ignorant waste

VA Medical Center.

of taxpayer dollars.

In addition, the closure of the Special Pathogens Laboratory (SPL) is detrimental
to  public  health  because  the  lab  was  one  of  the  top  hospital  infection  laboratories
in the Nation.

The  circumvention  of  appropriate  decision-making  processes  will  have  the  ulti-

mate effect of harm to public health.

I  want  to  commend  the  Chairman  and  staff  for  seeking  the  perspectives  of  sci-

entists who were in the Special Pathogens Laboratory.

Researchers  will  be  able  to  underscore  the  value  of  the  specimens  that  were  dis-

carded, and the consequences of that action on our nation’s public health.

Panel I:

Chairman  MILLER.  It  is  now  my  pleasure  to  introduce  our  first
panel of witnesses today. First is Dr. Victor Yu, a professor of med-
icine  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh.  Dr.  Janet  Stout  is  the  Direc-
tor of the Special Pathogens Laboratory. Dr. David Snydman is the
Chief  of  the  Division  of  Geographic  Medicine  and  Infectious  Dis-
eases and attending physician in infectious diseases at the Depart-
ment of Medicine at the Tufts Medical Center. I suspect that is not
what he says at cocktail parties that his job is.

You will all have five minutes for your oral testimony. Your writ-
ten  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record.  When  you  complete
your  testimony,  we  will  begin  with  questions.  Each  Member  will
have  five  minutes  to  question  the  panel.  It  is  the  practice  of  the
Committee,  because  we  are  an  Investigations  and  Oversight  Sub-
committee,  to  take  testimony  under  oath.  Do  any  of  you  have  any
objection to being sworn in, to swearing an oath? All the witnesses
nodded their heads that they did not. The Committee also provides
that  you  may  be  represented  by  counsel.  Are  any  of  you  rep-
resented  by  counsel  at  today’s  hearing?  All  three  of  witnesses  also
nodded  their  heads  no.  If  you  would  now  please  stand  and  raise
your  right  hand.  Do  you  swear  to  tell  the  truth  and  nothing  but
the  truth?  All  three  of  the  witnesses  said  that  they  did  so  swear.
Actually, if we could begin with Dr. Stout today. Dr. Stout, could

you begin?
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JANET  E.  STOUT,  DIRECTOR,  SPECIAL
PATHOGENS  LABORATORY;  RESEARCH  ASSOCIATE  PRO-
FESSOR,  DEPARTMENT  OF  CIVIL  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  EN-
GINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Dr.  STOUT.  Thank  you.  Members  of  the  Committee,  first  I  want
to  thank  you  for  holding  the  hearing.  I  am  Dr.  Janet  Stout.  I  re-
ceived  both  my  Master’s  and  Ph.D.  degrees  from  the  University  of
Pittsburgh  Graduate  School  of  Public  Health.  I  am  internationally
recognized  as  an  authority  on  Legionnaires’  disease.  I  have  au-
thored  book  chapters  and  more  than  80  publications  in  peer-re-
viewed  journals.  I  spent  25  years  at  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Medical
Center as a microbiologist in the Special Pathogens Laboratory. My
scientific  achievements  include  identifying  the  drinking  water,  not
air  conditioning,  as  the  real  source  for  hospital-acquired  Legion-
naires’ disease.

The VA Special Pathogens Laboratory was part of the VA micro-
biology  laboratory  and  served  as  a  national  Legionella  reference
laboratory  until  its  closure  in  2006.  The  accomplishments  of  this
laboratory  are  many.  The  collection  of  isolates  and  specimens
housed  in  this  collection  played  a  major  role  in  these  accomplish-
ments.  From  1979  to  2006,  we  banked  over  8,000  specimens  from
our  studies  on  Legionnaires’  disease  and  other  infections.  These
specimens  included  isolates  of  Legionella  and  thousands  of  serum,
respiratory and urine samples.

The  role  of  this  collection  of  microorganisms  in  our  discoveries
can  be  summarized  as  follows.  We  showed  that  Legionnaires’  dis-

ease was acquired from hospital drinking water systems. Legionella
isolates in our collection proved this association for hospitals across
the  United  States.  Our  laboratory  developed  new  and  better  ways
to detect and treat this disease. Every antibiotic and Legionella di-
agnostic test in use today was tested in our laboratory. Our collec-
tion  allowed  new  tests  to  fulfill  FDA  requirements  for  approval.
These specimens were destroyed.

We  developed  advanced  environmental  and  clinical  methods
which  were  not  used  by  many  laboratories.  Less-experienced  labs
gave incorrect results and bad advice, placing patients at risk. For
example,  in  2005,  one  laboratory  failed  to  diagnose  a  large  out-
break of Legionnaires’ disease in a nursing home. Using our collec-
tion, we showed that the urine antigen test used by that laboratory
gave false negative results. The specimens that allowed us to make
this  discovery  were  destroyed.  I  therefore  caution  the  Pittsburgh
VA, who is performing Legionella testing for free for other VA lab-
oratories, that this testing is being done by untrained and inexperi-
enced technicians.

Our  collection  included  isolates  from  every  hospital  using  our
laboratory.  Having  these  isolates  available  in  the  future  would  es-
tablish  whether  or  not  the  hospital  was  the  actual  source  of  infec-
tion  or  the  patient  acquired  the  disease  elsewhere.  These  isolates
were destroyed.

We  demonstrated  the  development  of  resistance  by  Legionella  to
a  commonly  used  water  disinfection  method.  This  observation  was
only  made  possible  by  comparison  of  historical  isolates  to  present-
day isolates. The specimens that allowed us to make this discovery
were destroyed.

We showed that the risk of illness to patients could be predicted.
Other  scientists  have  requested  our  specimens  for  study  in  their
laboratories  to  study  disease-causing  traits  and  evaluate  new  anti-
biotics.  These  specimens  are  no  longer  available  to  the  scientific
community for study. They were destroyed.

Our research was supported by the VA Merit Review System, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and industry. The VA Merit
Review  study  was  an  IRB-approved  study  involving  20  VA  institu-
tions across the United States. The results of this study were pub-
lished in 2007 in the journal Infection Control and Hospital Epide-
miology.

We  also  showed  that  patients  get  Legionnaires’  disease  from
drinking water in their own homes. This was an EPA-funded, IRB-
approved  study.  All  of  the  isolates  and  specimens  collected  during
the Merit Review and EPA studies were destroyed.

We  collected  these  isolates  for  research  purposes  and  the  re-
search was approved. Dr. Yu will provide the Committee with docu-
mentation to support this point.

What  did  we  do  to  save  the  collection?  I  wasn’t  concerned  about
the transfer of the collection from the VA because I knew other VA
investigators  had  transferred  their  collections  when  they  left  the
VA.  The  research  office  even  told  us  that  they  had  recently  gone
through  this  process  with  one  of  their  VA  physicians.  In  August
2006, we first expressed our concern for the safety of the collection.
In an e-mail from Dr. Yu to Dr. Graham, Dr. Yu stated, ‘‘I fear the
vindictiveness of the Administration may imperil this irreplaceable

14

collection.’’ We were reassured by Dr. Graham when he responded,
‘‘Of course I don’t want to see valuable specimens destroyed.’’ In re-
sponse,  Dr.  Yu  and  I  obtained  the  assistance  of  Dr.  Tim  Mietzner
at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  and  we  requested  the  transfer  of
these  materials  to  his  laboratory  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh.
From  August  through  December  2006,  I  actively  engaged  the  re-
search office in my attempt to transfer the collection to the univer-
sity.  VA  administration  was  copied  on  these  e-mails.  I  was  never
asked by anyone to provide any information on the contents of the
collection  and  there  was  never  any  indication  that  the  disposition
of  the  collection  was  in  question  or  that  the  collection  was  in  dan-
ger of being destroyed.

On  December  4,  2006,  Dr.  Sonel  notified  the  VA  administration
that I was to meet with the research compliance officer in the lab-
oratory the next day to begin the transfer. Later on that same day,
Dr. Sonel informed me via an e-mail that he was asked by the front
office  to  put  this  process  on  hold.  He  said  he  or  someone  from  the
front  office  will  be  contacting  me  about  this  request.  No  one  from
the  VA  ever  contacted  me  and  I  did  not  know  that  the  collection
had  been  destroyed.  Only  after  an  inquiry  from  Senator  Specter
and  Rick  Earl,  a  reporter,  did  the  VA  publicly  admit  to  destroying
the  collection.  For  me  as  a  scientist,  and  for  veterans  and  the
American public, the loss is incalculable.

In protest, a petition was published in the April issue of Clinical
Infectious  Diseases  and  signed  by  over  250  scientists  worldwide.
They  requested  that  an  investigative  committee  review  the  actions
of  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Healthcare  System  regarding  the  closure  of
the laboratory and the destruction of the scientifically valuable col-
lection of microorganisms.

The petition signatories and I thank you for your time today and

your effort in fulfilling this request. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Stout follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JANET E. STOUT

Members  of  the  Committee,  first  I  want  to  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing.
I  am  Dr.  Janet  Stout.  I  have  a  Ph.D.  in  infectious  disease  microbiology  and  I  am
a  Research  Associate  Professor  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  Department  of  Civil
and  Environmental  Engineering.  I  received  both  my  Masters  and  Ph.D.  degrees
from the University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Public Health.

I  am  internationally-recognized  as  an  authority  on  Legionnaires’  disease.  I  have
authored book chapters and more than 80 publications in peer-reviewed journals in-
cluding the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical
Association (See Stout CV in Section 8 of written testimony).

I have lectured on Legionnaires’ disease at national microbiology, infection control
and  engineering  conferences,  at  the  European  Working  Group  on  Legionella  Infec-
tion  and  in  2009,  I  will  speak  at  the  International  Legionella  Symposium  in  Paris
France.

I  spent  25  years  at  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Medical  Center  as  a  microbiologist  in  the

Special Pathogens Laboratory.

My  scientific  achievements  include  identifying  drinking  water—not  air  condi-
tioning—as  the  real  source  for  hospital-acquired  Legionnaires’  disease.  This  finding
was a major paradigm shift and unraveled the epidemiology of hospital-acquired Le-
gionnaires’ disease, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and
in the Lancet.

I have worked with State and local public health agencies in developing guidelines
for the prevention of hospital acquired Legionnaires’ disease. This work provided the
foundation for guidelines for the Health departments in the States of Maryland and
New  York,  and  the  countries  of  Spain,  Italy,  Taiwan,  the  Netherlands,  Denmark,
and France, and the VA Healthcare System.

In 2005, I was asked by the VA Medical Inspector General to assist him in devis-
ing a new VA Legionella prevention Directive, which was issued nationwide in Feb-
ruary 2008.

The Special Pathogens Laboratory

The VA Special Pathogens Laboratory was part of the VA microbiology laboratory
and  served  as  a  national  reference  laboratory  until  its  closure  in  2006.  As  a  micro-
biologist  in  this  unit,  I  performed  clinical  and  reference  laboratory  testing  for  VA
and  non-VA  institutions  (See  Stout  position  description  Section  5  of  written  testi-
mony).

I  was  among  the  many  students,  physicians  and  scientists  that  worked  in  this
‘‘Center  of  Excellence’’  and  whose  accomplishments  were  highlighted  in  the  VA
‘‘Vanguard’’ in 1996, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the discovery of Le-
gionnaires’ disease (See ‘‘Medical Advances May/June 1996).

The collection of isolates and specimens housed in this laboratory played a major
role  in  those  accomplishments  and  resulted  in  more  than  200  publications  on  Le-
gionnaires’ disease.

The Collection

A  scientifically  valuable  collection  of  microorganisms  was  destroyed.  In  order  to
fully understand the impact of this action, I will describe its scientific relevance and
how we were the guardians of the collection until its destruction in 2006.

I  was  trained  to  catalogue  isolates  and  specimens,  place  them  in  plastic  freezer
vials  at  -70°C  and  maintain  a  detailed  record  so  others  could  retrieve  the  isolates
for future study (See Section 4 of written testimony—Bacterial Stock Maintenance).
I  maintained  the  collection  in  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  at  the  VA  Medical
Center in Pittsburgh, PA. Information about the isolates was recorded in a log book
and typed into an electronic file on the lab computer.

From  1979  to  2006,  we  banked  over  8000  specimens  from  our  studies  on  Legion-
naires’  disease  and  other  infections.  The  specimens  included  isolates  of  Legionella,
Staphylococci,  Pseudomonas,  Klebsiella,  Enterococci,  Streptococci  and  Candida  spe-
cies  and  thousands  of  serum,  respiratory  and  urine  samples.  They  were  all  were
destroyed.

The role of this collection of microorganisms in our discoveries can be summarized

as follows:

1. We  showed  that  Legionnaires’  disease  was  acquired  from  hospital  drinking
water systems. Legionella isolates in our collection proved this association for
hospitals in Pittsburgh and across the U.S.

2. Our  laboratory  developed  new  and  better  ways  to  detect  and  treat  this  dis-
ease. Every antibiotic and Legionella diagnostic test in use today was tested
in  our  laboratory.  Our  collection  allowed  new  tests  to  fulfill  FDA  require-
ments for approval (See requests from scientist in Section 7 of written testi-
mony). These specimens were destroyed.

3. We  developed  advanced  environmental  and  clinical  methods.  Less  experi-
enced  laboratories  often  gave  incorrect  results  and  advice,  placing  patients
at  risk.  For  example,  in  2005  one  laboratory  failed  to  diagnose  a  large  out-
break  of  Legionnaires’  disease  in  a  nursing  home.  Using  our  collection,  we
showed that the urine antigen test used by the laboratory gave false negative
results.  The  specimens  that  allowed  us  to  make  this  discovery  were
destroyed.

4. Isolates from every hospital using our lab were stored in our freezer. Having
these isolates available in the future would establish whether or not the hos-
pital  was  the  actual  source  or  the  patient  acquired  the  disease  elsewhere.
These isolates were destroyed.

5. We  demonstrated  the  development  of  resistance  by  Legionella  to  a  com-
monly-used  water  disinfection  method—copper-silver  ionization.  This  obser-
vation  was  only  made  possible  by  comparison  of  historical  (frozen)  isolates
to present day isolates. The specimens that allowed us to make this dis-
covery were destroyed.

6. We  showed  that  the  risk  of  illness  to  patients  could  be  predicted.  Other  sci-
entists have requested our specimens for study in their laboratories to study
disease-causing  traits  and  evaluate  new  antibiotics.  These  isolates  are  no
longer available to the scientific community for study—they were de-
stroyed.

7. Our research was supported by the VA Merit Review System, the U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, and industry. The VA Merit Review study was
an  IRB  approved  study  involving  20  VA  institutions  across  the  U.S.  The  re-
sults  of  that  VA  Merit  Review-funded  study  were  published  in  2007  in  the
journal ‘‘Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.’’

8. We  also  showed  that  patients  get  Legionnaires’  disease  from  the  drinking

water in their own homes. This was an EPA-funded IRB-approved study.

All  of  the  isolates  and  specimens  collected  during  the  Merit  Review  and
EPA studies were destroyed.
Did  We  Collect  These  Isolates  For  Research  Purposes  and  Was  the  Re-
search Approved?

Dr.  Yu  and  the  other  VA  infectious  disease  physicians  participated  in  approved
research  activities  that  involved  the  collection  and  storage  of  microorganisms  and
specimens in the Special Pathogens Laboratory (See Section 5). When the lab closed
in July 2006, we had an active R&D approved study that was in effect through De-
cember 2006 entitled ‘‘Various Studies Examining Treatment, Prevalence and Eradi-
cation of Legionella’’ ID: 00137.
What Did We Do to Save the Collection?

Initially,  I  was  not  concerned  about  the  transfer  of  the  collection  from  the  VA.  I
knew  that  other  VA  investigators  had  left  the  VA  and  taken  their  collections  of
specimens  with  them.  The  VA  Research  office  even  told  us  that  they  had  recently
gone through this process with one of the VA physicians.
July  2006—During  a  meeting  in  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  in  July,  Sue
Mietzner, a microbiologist in our lab, showed Dr. Melham the freezer where our col-
lection  was  stored  and  told  her  of  its  importance.  She  also  showed  her  the  location
of the computer file describing the isolates. The handwritten log book containing all
the  isolate  identification  information  was  also  left  in  the  laboratory.  I  was  never
asked to provide any information on the contents of our collection.
August  2006—I  first  expressed  my  concern  for  the  safety  of  the  collection  in  an  e-
mail to Dr. Yu on August 12, 2006. In response, Dr. Yu immediately sent an e-mail
to Steven Graham, the head of Research requesting his assistance in protecting the
collection.  In  this  e-mail  Dr.  Yu  stated  ‘‘I  fear  the  vindictiveness  of  the  administra-
tion . . . may imperil this irreplaceable collection.’’

We  were  reassured  by  Dr.  Graham  when  he  responded:  ‘‘Of  course  I  don’t  want
to see valuable specimens destroyed, but these specimens are biohazards so we must
follow accepted procedures in order to transfer them. We recently went through this
process in regard to Dr. VonKammens samples at Highland Drive.’’

He told us that the collection ‘‘must be moved to an institution approved to handle
biohazards.  They  must  sign  a  materials  transfer  agreement  and  have  an  approved
biosafety program.’’

In  response,  Dr.  Yu  and  I  obtained  the  assistance  of  Dr.  Timothy  Mietzner,  Pro-
fessor  of  Molecular  Genetics  and  Molecular  Biology  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh
and  on  August  21st  we  requested  the  transfer  of  these  materials  to  his  laboratory
at the University of Pittsburgh.

More  assurances  came  from  Dr.  Sonel,  who  replaced  Dr.  Graham  as  head  of  Re-
search in September of 2006. In an e-mail to me on October 5th, he stated ‘‘We will
work with you to facilitate the transfer.’’
August  and  December  2006—There  were  numerous  e-mails  between  me  and  the
Research  office  to  affect  the  transfer  of  the  collection,  which  included  sending  the
Material Transfer form to the Research office. I actively engaged the Research office
in my attempt to transfer the collection to the University of Pittsburgh. VA Admin-
istration was copied on these e-mails.

Throughout  this  time,  there  was  never  any  indication  that  the  disposition  of  the
collection  was  in  question  or  that  the  collection  was  in  danger  of  being  destroyed.
Dr. Sonel notified the Pittsburgh VA Administration on December 4th that I was
to meet the Research Compliance Officer on December 5th in the Special Pathogens
Laboratory to begin the process of transferring the collection to the University.

In  response  to  this  information,  and  less  than  24  hours  before  I  was  to  start  the

transfer of the collection they destroyed our collection on December 4th, 2006.

The Pittsburgh VA administration failed to preserve and protect this valuable sci-

entific resource.
Were We Notified of this Action?

Dr.  Sonel  sent  me  an  e-mail  on  December  4th  informing  me  that  he  ‘‘was  asked
by  the  front  office  to  put  this  process  on  hold.  I  or  someone  from  the  front  office
will  be  updating  you  soon  regarding  this  request.  I  apologize  for  any  inconvenience
that this may have caused.’’

No one from the VA has ever contacted me regarding the destruction of our collec-

tion.
For  me  as  a  scientist,  and  for  Veterans  and  the  American  public—The  loss
is incalculable.

A  petition  was  published  in  the  April  2008  issue  of  the  medical  journal  ‘‘Clinical
Infectious  Diseases’’  (CID  2008;46:1053–9)  and  signed  by  over  250  scientists.  They
requested  that  an  investigative  committee  review  the  actions  of  the  Pittsburgh  VA
Healthcare  System  regarding  the  closure  of  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  and
the destruction of a scientifically valuable collection of microorganisms.

The  petition  signatories  and  I  thank  you  for  your  time  and  effort  today  in  ful-

filling this request.

The Special Pathogens Laboratory

The Special Pathogens Laboratory has existed as a special microbiology laboratory
at  the  University  Drive  VA  since  1981.  The  initial  funding  and  FTE’s  for  the  unit
were  provided  by  VA  Central  Office  in  response  to  endemic  hospital-acquired  Le-
gionnaires’  disease  at  the  hospital.  Thereafter,  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory
has  been  funded  through  the  clinical  microbiology  laboratory  (  a  microbiology  sub
account) as well as by grant and industry support.

The  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  is  a  diagnostic,  training,  and  clinical  research
laboratory,  varied  in  scope  of  operations  and  a  nationally  recognized  Legionella  re-
source/reference  center.  The  microbiologists  assigned  to  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab-
oratory are responsible for day-to-day patient care testing, research projects and lab-
oratory  functions.  This  includes  the  teaching  and  training  of  students,  clinical  re-
search  and  LegionelIa  resource/reference  laboratory  testing  for  VA  and  non-VA  fa-
cilities.

Dr.  Stout  is  an  internationally  recognized  microbiologist  who  is  an  expert  on  the
microbiology and epidemiology of Legionnaires’ disease. Dr. Stout has assisted pub-
lic  health  agencies  such  as  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  as  well
as  State  and  local  health  agencies  in  Legionella  outbreak  investigations.  The  VA
Medical Inspector General contacted Dr. Stout in 2006 to assist in the development
of  a  Legionnaires’  disease  prevention  plan  for  the  VA  nationwide.  She  has  over  70
peer-reviewed publications.

Closing of the Special Pathogens Laboratory

The  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  has  been  active  for  approximately  25  years,
and  in  that  time  has  become  internationally  recognized  as  a  Legionella  reference
center.  The  closure  of  the  laboratory  was  swift  and  disorganized—the  culmination
of an inquiry that denied Dr. Victor Yu (the Chief of Infectious Diseases and Micro-
biology) a fair appeal.

It  was  within  this  atmosphere  of  chaos  that  I  was  repeatedly  informed  by  Dr.
Melhem that all Legionella testing functions of the lab were to be transferred to the
clinical  microbiology  laboratory.  Only  one  person  in  this  lab  has  limited  ability  to
perform  Legionella  clinical  testing  and  no  one  in  this  lab  has  the  capability  to  per-
form Legionella environmental testing.

This  decision  by  Dr.  Melhem  and  Mr.  Moreland  was  made  despite  Dr.  Yu’s  re-
peated  requests  for  a  review  of  the  decision  by  VA  Central  office.  In  addition,  one
reason given by Dr. Melhem for the speed of the closure was the imminent demoli-
tion  of  Building  2—the  building  which  houses  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory.
When asked about this, Engineering service could not verify this assertion.

I  was  required  to  meet  with  Dr.  Gutkin  and  Cheryl  Wanzie  to  coordinate  the
move of equipment and Legionella testing supplies so that this testing would be per-
formed in Building 1 the clinical microbiology laboratory. We agreed that this would
be done on July 25th. July 19th, I was asked to meet with Dr. Melhem—Dr. Muder
and Cheryl Wanzie were present at this meeting. Dr. Melhem informed us that the
equipment  and  supplies  would  be  moved  within  the  next  two  hours!  Again  she  re-
peated the statement that Building 2 was set to be demolished as a justification for
the hurried pace. I was directed to move all clinical specimens from our -70° freezer
into  a  freezer  that  was  being  moved  (that  day)  to  the  clinical  laboratory.  This  re-
quired  the  removal  and  transfer  of  specimens  from  one  freezer  into  the  other.  It  is
important to note that as a Legionella reference laboratory, we maintain a collection

18

of specimens and isolates in these freezers that are of historical significance and are
irreplaceable.

Board of Investigation

Also  within  this  same  time  period  on  July  19th,  I  was  contacted  by  David  Cord
to  appear  at  a  Fact  Finding  Administrative  Board  of  Investigation  to  testify  as  a
witness.  Mr.  Cord  noted  that  I  was  ‘‘not  the  subject  of  the  investigation,  but  testi-
fying as a witness.’’ I was to appear that afternoon.

It  was  at  this  time  that  I  experienced  cardiac-related  symptoms  and  called  a
friend  to  take  me  to  my  doctor’s  office.  Upon  arrival  at  the  office,  the  staff  advised
me to go to the emergency room (ER). I went directly to the ER of West Penn Hos-
pital.  After  undergoing  several  tests,  I  was  told  that  they  wanted  to  admit  me  for
additional tests, including a cardiac stress test. After consultation with the ER phy-
sician,  I  agreed  to  arrange  for  the  testing  the  next  day,  and  I  signed  out  Against
Medical Advice (AMA).

Both  Mr.  Cord  and  Mr.  Bonner  were  notified  of  my  medical  situation  and  that
my  appearance  at  the  board  would  need  to  be  rescheduled.  They  were  also  made
aware of my scheduled leave for July 21 and July 24th.

Given  that  we  were  informed  that  access  to  the  laboratory  and  our  materials
would be restricted, I asked the laboratory staff to pack our things. These files were
removed to preserve our research. They were then placed in the custody of my attor-
ney.

The laboratory service secretary and time keeper (Lorraine Paternoster) was noti-
fied  on  July  20th  of  my  ER  visit  via  voice  mail  before  7  a.m.  on  July  20th.  I  re-
quested  four  hours  of  sick  leave  for  July  19th  (12:30–4:30  p.m.)  and  eight  hours  of
sick leave for July 20th.

Thursday,  July  20th,  I  went  to  my  doctor’s  office  to  make  arrangements  for  the
cardiac  stress  test.  Given  that  I  was  scheduled  off  to  annual  leave  for  Friday  the
21st  and  Monday  the  24th,  I  left  Pittsburgh  to  attend  to  my  previously  scheduled
personal matter.

Cheryl  Wanzie  attempted  to  reach  me  on  Thursday,  but  failed  to  do  so  before  I
left  Pittsburgh.  She  left  a  voice  mail  message  at  my  home  stating  that  she  was  in-
forming  me  that  she  had  canceled  my  annual  leave  and  that  I  was  considered  ab-
sent without leave (AWOL).

Upon  my  return  to  work  on  July  25th,  I  called  Mr.  Cord  expecting  to  be  inter-
viewed  at  the  ‘‘Board  of  Investigation’’  that  day—given  the  apparent  urgency  dis-
played the week before.

Instead  I  was  told  that  my  testimony  was  scheduled  for  Monday  August  2nd.  I
explained  to  Mr.  Cord  that  I  was  scheduled  off  on  annual  leave  from  Monday  July
31st  to  Thursday  August  3rd.  I  suggested  that  I  testify  any  time  between  July  25–
28,  but  because  Dr.  Graham  was  out  of  the  office  on  vacation  we  had  to  wait  until
his  return.  I  requested  that  my  testimony  be  scheduled  for  Friday  August  4th  or
that we have Dr. Graham attend the meeting via conference call. Mr. Cord arranged
to have my testimony scheduled for 10 a.m. on Friday August 4th.

I  was  notified  on  August  24,  2006  that  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System—
University  Drive  Division  proposed  to  remove  me  from  my  position  as  a  GS–11
Microbiologist  with  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  for  ‘‘Misuse  of  Government
Property:  Failure  to  Safeguard  Confidential  and  Privacy  Act  protected  Data  in  Vio-
lation of VA PHS Privacy Policy, MCM RI–17.’’

This action against me by the Agency was challenged with the assistance and rep-
resentation of the AFGE Union President Robert Bonner and attorney George Love,
Esq. The proposed termination was ultimately not upheld by the Administration. In-
stead  they  imposed  a  30-day  suspension—without  pay.  This  action  is  also  being
challenged through the merit System Protection Board (MSPB).

Upon  completion  of  the  30-day  suspension,  I  returned  to  the  VA  Pittsburgh
Healthcare  System—University  Drive  microbiology  section  on  December  13,  2006.  I
was  immediately  presented  with  a  ‘‘Performance  Improvement  Plan,’’  (PIP)  which
claimed that my performance was unsatisfactory in several critical areas. The items
listed  in  the  PIP  were  complete  fabrications.  Interestingly,  the  PIP  was  signed  by
the microbiology supervisor, but he emphasized that he had not participated in writ-
ing it. He was, however, responsible for implementing it.

In  addition,  the  new  position  description  that  was  created  for  me  prior  to  my  re-

turn to duty was never reviewed by the Union—per the AFGE contract.

As  mentioned  previously,  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  was  an  internation-
ally-recognized Legionella reference laboratory. We maintained a collection of speci-
mens and isolates in the lab freezers that are of historical significance and are irre-
placeable.  Despite  our  inquiries  for  the  transfer  of  this  collection  to  the  University,
Dr. Melhem ordered the destruction of this irreplaceable collection of research mate-

rial.  This  was  done  despite  recommendations  to  the  contrary  from  Dr.  Robert
Muder—the  Chief  of  Infectious  Diseases.  We  were  never  informed  that  this  action
was to be taken.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JANET E. STOUT

Dr. Stout received her BS in Biology from Clarion State College, Clarion, Pennsyl-
vania;  and  her  Master’s  and  Ph.D.  degrees  in  Microbiology  from  the  University  of
Pittsburgh.

Dr.  Stout  is  the  Director  of  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  in  Pittsburgh,  PA
and concurrently a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and En-
vironmental Engineering University of Pittsburgh.

Dr.  Stout  discovered  the  link  between  the  presence  of  Legionella  bacteria  in  hos-
pital  water  systems  and  the  occurrence  of  hospital-acquired  Legionnaires’  disease
while  working  at  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Medical  Center.  She  was  instrumental  in  the
development  of  the  prevention  strategy  that  serves  as  the  foundation  for  the  VHA
Legionella  Directive.  Dr.  Stout  gave  the  Professional  Development  Course  on
Legionella  at  the  American  Industrial  Hygiene  Association  (AIHA)  Conference  in
2007.

She  has  authored  approximately  80  peer  review  papers  in  the  area  of  Legion-
naires’  disease,  which  include  papers  in  the  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine,
Journal  of  the  American  Medical  Association,  the  Journal  of  Clinical  Microbiology,
and  the  Journal  of  the  American  Water  Works  Association.  Dr.  Stout  has  also  au-
thored  book  chapters  on  Legionnaires’  disease,  including  the  Legionella  chapter  in
the Manual of Clinical Microbiology.

Recent  research  projects  include:  Eradication  of  Legionella  from  hospital  water
systems  by  copper-silver  ionization  and  chlorine  dioxide  and  development  of  micro-
biological criteria for assessing risk of Legionnaires’ disease.

Dr.  Stout  is  a  member  of  the  American  Society  for  Microbiology,  the  Association
for  Professionals  in  Infection  Control,  and  the  American  Society  of  Heating,  Refrig-
eration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Dr. Stout.

STATEMENT OF DR. VICTOR L. YU, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE,

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Dr.  YU.  Thank  you  so  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  Congressman  Rohr-
abacher  and  Congressman  Broun  for  allowing  us  to  tell  you  this
terrible tragedy.

As  you  mentioned,  I  am  Professor  of  Medicine  at  the  University
of  Pittsburgh.  I  have  been  there  since  1978,  and  during  most  of
those years I was also Chief of the Infectious Disease Section at the
Pittsburgh VA Medical Center. My CV is 51 pages long but I have
published  600  papers  and  abstracts  and  written  six  textbooks  of
medicine.  I  have  gotten  many  honors  in  my  CV  but  I  think  I  will
only  mention  one.  I  received  the  Distinguished  Research  Award
from  the  American  Legion  for  our  achievements  and  Janet’s
achievements  in  unraveling  the  mystery  of  how  the  disease  was
contracted  and  how  the  disease  might  be  prevented  and  cured.
That  plaque  honoring  that  achievement  was  in  the  lobby  of  the
Pittsburgh  VA  Medical  Center  for  many  years,  although  I  am  told
that it is no longer there.

The Special Pathogens Lab was established in 1980 and you gave
sort  of  a  good  overview,  and  Dr.  Stout  listed  its  achievements,  but
it  also  made  important  discoveries  in  MRSA,  methicillin-resistant
Staph aureus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, pneumonia, and urinary
tract  infections.  We  ultimately  established  collections  of  fungi  and
virtually  all  human  pathogens  of  man  that  are  commonplace.  We
established international collaborative studies with investigators in
Africa,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  China,  Hong  Kong,  Argentina,
Brazil,  Canada,  Norway,  Sweden,  every  inhabitable  continent.  In-
vestigators  interested  in  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  contributed
pathogens to our laboratory and in huge international collaborative
attempts  actually  collected  data  from  these  patients  and  then  sent

the isolates to one standard reference laboratory. Over 200 publica-
tions from these talented and prestigious investigative groups from
France  to  Taiwan  to  Australia  participated  in  this  massive  effort,
which was a true international community effort.

When we first started in the early 1980s, we had one microbiolo-
gist and one graduate student named Janet E. Stout, and then over
time  the  VA  asked  us  to  come  under  a  mandate  called  the  Special
Clinical Resource Center. We became the Special Pathogens Lab of
the  entire  Pittsburgh  VA  Center,  and  over  the  next  10  to  12  years
we have evolved into five laboratory scientists headed by Dr. Stout.
And  then  in  2006,  inexplicably,  Mr.  Moreland,  the  director  of  the
VA, terminated the laboratory. On Wednesday he came in, handed
us  a  directive,  the  laboratory  is  closed.  There  was  no  forewarning
of  any  sort.  All  five  individuals,  university  employees  who  are  sci-
entists, were all terminated immediately. They lost their livelihood.
No  explanation  was  given.  On  July  12,  one  week  later,  I  asked  for
a  written  explanation  of  why  this  happened.  The  effect  was  so
stunning  that  we  couldn’t  understand  why  it  was  done  and  I  said
it is morally imperative for you to place in writing why you termi-
nated  this  laboratory  of  20-plus  years  with  all  of  its  accomplish-
ments  and  give  us  the  reasons  why  so  that  we  could  respond.  We
couldn’t  even  appeal  because  48  hours  later,  all  the  personnel  had
to  evacuate.  They  were  told  that  if  they  left  their  personal  belong-
ings  behind,  they  would  never  be  able  to  retrieve  them.  And  48
hours  later,  the  laboratory  was  padlocked.  However,  Mr.  Moreland
forgot one thing. We were processing specimens for patients in the
ICU in addition to patients from medical centers all over the coun-
try.  So  if  he  terminated  immediately,  what  about  the  patients  at
the VA Highland Drive, a few miles away? What about patients in
the ICU a few floors away? So they reluctantly gave us 14 days but
they  gave  me  an  order:  no  more  specimens  from  anyplace  else  can
be  processed  and  tell  everybody  that  you  cannot  have  any  more
specimens  processed.  But  we  had  600  clients  and  they  don’t  send
us  specimens  every  day.  As  outbreaks  occur  across  the  United
States, public health departments who wonder if it is Legionnaires’
disease  send  their  specimens  by  Federal  Express,  and  you  can  see
the UPS and Federal Express trucks coming every day dropping off
specimens,  and  now  we  have  10  to  14  days  to  process  all  these
specimens. We couldn’t contact 600 clients by fax. So now I had to
make  a  decision.  Should  I  not  process  these  specimens,  and  since
they  gave  us  no  reason  for  the  closure,  I  sent  an  e-mail  to  Mr.
Moreland  and  I  said  I  have  a  difficult  decision  to  make,  Mr.
Moreland  you  have  told  me  I  cannot  process  any  of  these  speci-
mens,  and  specimens  from  Bayside  Hospital,  Johns  Hopkins-affili-
ated hospitals, Phoenix VA were coming in and they were thinking
that  maybe  they  had  outbreaks  of  Legionnaires’  disease.  So  I  as  a
physician researcher placed an e-mail and said I have a conscience
as  a  physician  researcher.  I  can  decide  to  disobey  the  order  and
know  that  I  will  be  terminated  as  my  laboratory  colleagues  were
terminated or I can do my duty.

I  did  my  duty.  We  processed  those  specimens.  But  we  needed
supplies and the supplies were kept by the security police from en-
tering into the laboratory. Microscopes were taken from our labora-
tory,  and  there  is  documentation  of  all  the  disruptions.  They  held

a hearing, and the laboratory technicians had to leave their job and
go  to  a  witch  hunt-type  hearing,  and  they  were  told  that  if  you
don’t  come,  maybe  there  is  going  to  be  problems,  so  they  went  to
these hearings and then we had to process all these specimens that
were  coming  in  including  patients  in  our  own  intensive  care  unit.
So  there  was  tremendous  pressure  on  all  of  us.  Janet  Stout  even
ended up having to go to cardiac clinic because she was developing
chest  pains.  But  we  worked  hard  on  it.  They  rose  to  the  occasion.
When  we  ran  out  of  supplies,  the  laboratory  researchers  pooled
their  own  funds  to  buy  supplies  and  bring  them  into  the  lab.  If
they  had  to  go  to  the  bathroom  and  they  walked  outside  the  door,
the  laboratory  door  fell  shut.  The  security  guard  refused  to  let
them  in.  They  had  to  use  their  cell  phones  to  call  the  lab  people
inside to let them in.

The  work  continued.  And  we  had  15  specimens  left  from  a  gov-
ernment  building,  14  hospitals  and  from  a  wife  of  a  patient  who
died  of  Legionnaires’  disease  who  was  trying  to  find  out  if  the
source  of  her  husband’s  Legionella  came  from  their  water  supply,
and  in  the  appendix  is  the  discussion  of  what  she  went  through.
She was in California and couldn’t find a laboratory to do the proc-
essing,  and  then  through  a  contact  at  one  of  the  hospitals  she
ended up calling Janet Stout, who advised her what to do. She esti-
mated  that  the  cost  from  the  other  laboratories  that  she  contacted
would  be  over  $2,000.  Janet  Stout  said  that  she  would  do  it  for
free, send us the specimens as soon as possible, but the timing was
so  bad.  By  the  time  she  got  to  the  specimens  and  Federal  Ex-
pressed  them  to  us,  we  planted  the  cultures.  She  wanted  to  know
what  the  results  were;  so  did  we.  Mr.  Moreland  said  you  cannot
look at the culture results. We had processed all the specimens. All
Janet had to do was look at the culture plate, and using dyes that
were  formulated  by  this  Pittsburgh  VA,  we  could  tell  if  there  was
Legionella, and then using a microscope we could identify if it was
Legionella. Fifteen specimens lined up on the counter. We asked for
permission  to  go  back  into  the  hospital  on  day  11  after  day  10  to
give  the  results  to  these  hospitals  and  to  the  wife.  It  was  refused.
Over the next two weeks the specimens dried up. We don’t know
what  the  results  were  and  we  thought  we  lost  it  for  the  hospitals,
but the Phoenix VA got lucky. Why? Because their specimens were
the  last  specimens  processed.  They  were  interpreted  and  read  and
faxed.  Sixty-five  percent  of  the  Phoenix  VA  water  samples  were
positive for Legionella. They sent the specimens to us because they
suspected  an  outbreak  of  Legionnaires’  disease  but  there  was  con-
troversy  within  the  center  that  were  these  really  Legionella.  Well,
maybe—we  have  a  VA  reference  lab.  If  it  is,  we  will  look  in  the
water.  They  found  it.  That  was  the  last  duty  of  the  Pittsburgh  VA
Special Pathogens Laboratory.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Yu, this is compelling testimony but could

you summarize?

Dr. YU. Yes.
Chairman MILLER. Thank you.
Dr.  YU.  Okay.  So  the  one  question  is,  and  I  had  to  listen  to  it
for  all  these  years,  the  last  two  years,  this  is  not  approved  re-
search. It is not approved research, all these papers? And then two
weeks ago I got from your committee a document that I had never

seen  before  and  it  says  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  Publica-
tion  Audit.  This  was  the  document  that  Mr.  Moreland  used  to  say
that  we  did  unapproved  research.  All  these  Merit  Review  publica-
tions,  that  wasn’t  approved?  So  I  looked  at  it,  and  this  is  one  of
the  cleverest  documents  that  man  has  ever  contrived.  A  full  de-
scription is in the Appendix, but I will give you the highlights. Six
articles that had no documentation and this document is the docu-
mentation in Appendix B. Ten out of these 39 studies, all 39 stud-
ies, there is no documentation. Ten were observational studies, and
under  federal  code  do  not  have  to  be  mandated  by  human  rights
review  so  they  included  these  10  studies  that  we  had  published.
Seven  studies  that  were  not—that  were  published  and  not  ap-
proved  by  the  VA  were  studies  from  other  hospitals.  One  of  them
was  in  Russia,  and  if  a  study  is  done  in  Russia,  it  doesn’t  need
Pittsburgh  VA  IRB  approval.  Three  studies  had  no  patients  in
them,  and  if  you  do  a  study  with  no  patients,  you  don’t  have  to
have  human  IRB  approval.  Every  one  of  the  39  articles  was  legiti-
mate.

So why are these microbes so important? Well, here is one exam-
ple. One study came from published in Chest. It said there was no
documentation,  and  in  the  Appendix,  the  documentation  is  there.
Two other studies by Janet Stout said no documentation, and they
were there. And what were those studies? We received a compound
from  Daiichi,  Japan.  We  were  looking  for  antibiotics  that  would
cure  Legionnaires’  disease  because  the  mortality  was  still  high
using  existing  antibiotics.  Dr.  Stout  devised  an  intracellular  model
that  you  wouldn’t  have  to  use  animals,  so  using  that  model,  she
found  that  this  compound  was  highly  active,  more  active  than  any
compound we had ever seen. Then we recommended that it go into
clinical trials. OrthoMcNeil developed a compound for clinical trials
and it was given to several thousand patients in the United States
with  community  pneumonia  and  hospitals  all  over  the  United
States  started  sending  their  culture  specimens  to  Janet  Stout  to
see if they had Legionnaires’ disease, and we found all these cases
of  Legionnaires’  disease  that  no  one  would  have  suspected  if  they
had not been sent to Dr. Stout.

received 

levofloxacin, 

the  new  name 

And  then  we  broke  the  code.  What  antibiotic  did  these  patients
receive?  They 
that
OrthoMcNeil  gave  this  compound.  The  mortality  for  Legionnaires’
disease  in  this  study  was  zero  percent.  Well  no  antibiotic  is  100
percent  effective.  Four  years  later,  in  the  largest  outbreak  ever  to
hit Europe, over 200 patients contracted Legionnaires’ disease. The
decision  was  made  to  give  every  single  patient  levofloxacin.  Not  a
single  patient  died.  Think  about  all  the  patients  who  died  in  the
American  Legion  outbreak  in  1976.  Organisms  that  we  had,  Mr.
Moreland  destroyed  all  of  these  organisms.  We  now  receive  com-
pounds  from  all  over  the  world  and  we  can’t  do  the  studies  any-
more  and  we  can’t  devise  a  diagnostic  test  because  of  what  Mr.
Moreland did.
Thank you.

Introduction

My  name  is  Dr.  Victor  Yu.  I  am  a  Professor  of  Medicine  in  the  Division  of  Infec-
tious  Diseases  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh.  I  have  been  a  University  Professor
since  1978  and  most  of  that  time  was  also  Chief  of  the  Infectious  Disease  section
at the VA Medical Center, an affiliated teaching hospital of the University of Pitts-
burgh.

I  have  published  widely  on  Legionnaires’  disease,  pneumonia,  bloodborne  patho-
gens, MRSA (Methicillin resistant Staph. aureus), antibiotic resistance, anal medical
informatics.  I  have  a  background  in  mathematics  and  computer  science  so  I  have
devised an idea of accumulating clinical information about patients, their laboratory
values,  their  underlying  diseases,  the  antibiotics  that  they  received,  and  their  out-
come.  I  realized  that  having  a  computer  database  for  thousands  of  patients  would
enable us to make statistical correlations about epidemiology and therapy In the era
of  antibiotic  resistance  and  new  emerging  pathogens,  such  a  database  has  been  in-
valuable.

Using  this  approach,  over  .100  articles  in  different  areas  of  infectious  diseases
have  been  published  and  led  to  therapeutic  advances.  I  organized  large  inter-
national  collaborative  groups  of  physicians  and  scientists  who  have  contributed  pa-
tient  information  into  the  computer  database  as  well  as  microbial  pathogens  that
caused  these  infections.  This  treasure  trove  of  computerized  data  plus  a  collection
of  human  pathogens  has  led  to  many  advances  in  management  and  diagnosis  of
very difficult infectious diseases.

Encounter with Legionnaires’ Disease

After  the  American  Legion  outbreak  in  Philadelphia  in  1976,  it  was  soon  discov-
ered  that  other  cases  of  Legionnaires’  disease  were  occurring.  As  a  junior  assistant
professor  in  1979,  I  came  across  the  first  cases  of  hospital-acquired  or  nosocomial
Legionnaires’ disease. It had caused a serious problem at three VA Medical Centers:
Wadsworth  VA  Medical  Center  in  Los  Angeles,  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Medical  Center,
and  the  Togus,  Maine  VA  Medical  Center:  It  was  a  shock  to  find  out  that  it  was
being contracted by patients in the hospital.

Dr.  Janet  E.  Stout,  Ph.D.,  would  soon  make  the  startling  discovery  that  the
Legionella  bacteria;  the  causative  agent  of  Legionnaires’  disease  was  in  the  driving
water  supply  of  the  hospital.  The  prevailing  theory  at  that  time  was  that  it  was  in
cooling towers and air conditioners. Even today, many physicians are not aware that
drinking water is the major source.

Because  of  this  occurrence,  we  were  given  funding  by  VA  Central  Office  to  add
a  special  microbiologist  to  the  Infectious  Disease  staff  to  assist  us.  Legionella  is  a
fastidious  organism  that  requires  expertise  and  special  techniques  to  isolate.  Dr.
Susan  Mather  in  VA  Central  Office  (enclosed  letter)  oversaw  the  investigation  into
Legionnaires’ disease.

One of the reasons we were given extra funding and assistance is that outbreaks
were being described all over the world besides the VA Hospital, and we had formu-
lated a culture media that microbiologists could identify Legionella by the coloration
on  the  culture  plates.  This  technical  advance  accelerated  the  ability  to  diagnose
Legionella  from  patients  and  from  the  environment.  Over  the  next  many  years,  we
would  accomplish  a  number  of  things  with  respect  to  Legionella,  microbiology  and
public health.

Dr.  Stout  has  listed  the  advances  made  by  the  VA  Special  Pathogens  Lab  in  her
testimony which includes evaluating all the commercially available tests for Legion-
naires’  disease,  evaluating  all  commercially  available  antibiotics  for  therapy  of  Le-
gionnaires’  disease,  describing  the  clinical  manifestations  of  Legionnaires’  disease,
and  formulating  the  disinfection  method  of  eradicating  Legionella  from  drinking
water.

HISTORY OF THE SPECIAL PATHOGENS LABORATORY

The  Special  Pathogens  Lab  was  established  in  about  1980.  Because  of  the  large
number  of  outbreaks  that  were  occurring  in  Veterans  Affairs  Medical  Centers,  VA
Central  Office  awarded  two  full-time  employee  slots  to  Pittsburgh  to  respond.  Dur-
ing  those  early  years,  we  pioneered  the  use  of  various  tests  and  most  importantly,
formulated  the  culture  media  in  which  Legionella  could  be  identified  by  color,  thus

aureus 

allowing  the  microbiologists  to  get  preliminary  identification  of  the  Legionella  by
looking  at  a  culture  plate;  a  microscope  was  not  needed.  In  the  next  several  years,
we became quite prolific in advances in Legionnaires’ disease.

About  1984,  we  received  our  first  VA  Merit  Review  Grant  dealing  with  Legion-
naires’ disease. About three years later, Martin Sax, then Chief of the Research and
Development Committee, approached us and suggested that we become active mem-
bers  of  the  Veterans  Research  Foundation.  Given  our  reputation,  we  could  solicit
funds from industry and other sources to supplement the funds coming into the Vet-
erans  Research  Foundation.  He  offered  us  lab  space  as  cuts  in  the  VA  budget  were
forcing  many  VA  researchers  to  discontinue  their  studies.  We  agreed.  We  subse-
quently were able to bring in funds from foundations and industry for work on dis-
infection  modalities,  and  antibiotic  studies  of  a  whole  host  of  pathogens,  including
Staphylococcus 
pneumoniae,  Enterococcus,
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  Enterobacter,  Stenotrophomonas  maltophilia,  Bacteroides,
and fungi (Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus).

(MRSA),  Streptococcus 

However,  in  subsequent  years  we  branched  out  into  pathogens  of  community-ac-
quired  pneumonia,  urinary  tract  infections,  abdominal  abscesses,  and  endocarditis.
We  acquired  expertise  in  antimicrobial  resistance  and  published  about  100  articles
in this area. We were able to bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Vet-
erans Research Foundation which allowed them to gain critical mass and justify lab-
oratory space.

In 1994, as the VA budget was being cut, VA Central Office sent out a solicitation
to  academic  researchers  about  the  possibility  of  using  their  capabilities  to  initiate
laboratories  for  profit.  This  was  based  on  a  1994  Special  Clinical  Resource  Center
memorandum.  In  1996,  the  Director  of  the  VA  and  Chief  of  Pathology  agreed  that
designating  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  as  Special  Clinical  Resource  Center
was feasible. And, in 1996, the Special Pathogens Lab went national.

Over the next many years our laboratory and clinical work continued. Funds were
brought  into  the  Veterans  Research  Foundation  under  grants  I  wrote  as  Professor
of  Medicine  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh.  Five  University  employees  including  a
CDC-trained  microbiologist  were  brought  in  to  handle  the  growing  amount  of  re-
search  activity.  New  instrumentation,  equipment  and  supplies  awarded  to  the  Uni-
versity  of  Pittsburgh  was  brought  into  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab.  All  this  equip-
ment was tagged as University of Pittsburgh equipment.

In those early years, the VA budget was very thin and most VA laboratories were
not only understaffed but their equipment was outdated. Since we were using micro-
biology equipment for research which also could be used to handle the clinical load,
we  outfitted  the  VA  Clinical  Microbiology  Laboratory  with  modern  equipment  and
furniture.  This  made  our  laboratory  one  of  the  best  equipped  laboratories  in  Penn-
sylvania, and both the research and patient care benefited.

Graduate students, infectious disease fellows, and visiting professors, came to the
Special  Pathogens  Lab  to  our  laboratory  to  learn  new  techniques  and  assist  with
clinical studies. Their participation led to many breakthroughs in infectious diseases
over the next 12 years.

In 2006, inexplicably, the Special Pathogens Lab was shut down by Mr. Moreland,
Director of the Pittsburgh VA. The specific reasons were never given to us as noted
in  my  letter  of  July  12,  2006  (Appendix).  We  were  given  only  48  hours  notice  and
the  entire  tab  was  to  be  shut  down.  All  the  Lab  personnel  were  fixed,  and  the  Lab
was to be padlocked. Mr. Moreland had been in his position as Director of the Hos-
pital  for  only  a  few  years  and  some  of  the  laboratory  personnel  had  been  there  for
more than 10 years and their livelihood and occupation was shattered with one 48-
hour notice. It should be noted that this violated the provisions of the Special Clin-
ical Resource Center memorandum which had guidelines to insure that patient care
and other aspects would not suffer from abrupt lab closure.

However, Mr. Moreland overlooked the fact that we were processing specimens for
the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center patients as well and reluctantly agreed to a two-
week  moratorium.  During  that  time  specimens  from  all  over  the  country  continued
to come into the Special Pathogens Laboratory as usual.

We  were  ordered  to  notify  all  of  our  clients  that  the  lab  was  being  closed,  but
since  we  had  600  different  clients  including  health  departments  and  hospitals,
faxing  to  600  clients  was  impossible.  Moreover  we  had  two  weeks  to  complete  a
huge  workload.  During  this  time,  the  laboratory  personnel  were  harassed  by  secu-
rity  guards  and  administrators.  Microscopes  were  removed.  When  the  laboratory
technician  left  the  laboratory  for  breaks  or  lunch,  the  security  guards  refused  to
unlock  the  doors  such  that  the  personnel  in  the  lab  had  to  come  out  an  open  the
doors  for  them.  It  was  a  Gestapo-like  atmosphere  and  caused  tremendous  stress
among the laboratory personnel. Yet, they accelerated their efforts in trying to proc-
ess all the samples that were coming in.

Because  the  results  were  so  important  to  the  hospitals  and  health  departments,
we  no  longer  had  the  time  necessary  to  enter  them  into  the  computer,  send  out  in-
voices,  and  so  forth.  Moreover,  Mr.  Moreland  stopped  the  supplies  from  entering
into  our  laboratory  so  that  supplies  which  had  been  purchased  were  not  allowed  to
be used and delivered to the personnel. Moreover, he refused to allow us to purchase
materials for the specimens which included Pittsburgh VA patients to lie processed.
The laboratory personnel pooled their own funds to buy these supplies.

They  were  true  heroes  working  for  the  VA  patients  and  the  U.S.  community.  In
the last two weeks, Mr. Moreland ordered me to stop accepting specimens from out-
side  the  University  of  Pittsburgh.  I  wrote  to  him  that  this  was  a  Hobson’s  choice:
Obey an administrative order from the Director or follow my conscience as a physi-
cian  researcher  and  process  specimens  from  patients,  hospitals,  and  public  health
agencies.  I  decided  to  process  these  specimens  and  informed  Mr.  Moreland  the  rea-
sons  for  doing  so.  One  set  of  samples  came  from  the  Phoenix  VA  Medical  Center.
Sixty-five  percent  of  the  hospital  drinking  water  specimens  yielded  Legionella  and
uncovered  an  endemic  outbreak  of  Legionnaires’  disease.  This  outbreak  and  the
source would not have been identified if I had not continued to process the incoming
water specimens.

During  this  time,  the  Lab  personnel  were  not  only  harassed,  but  each  was  asked
to  give  sworn  testimony  at  an  investigative  hearing.  This  was  done  during  their
work hours and added to their stress.

The  saga  of  what  happened  to  the  last  15  clients’  specimens  that  were  processed
is  a  matter  of  record  (See  www.legionella.org/vaspl.asp).  On  the  day  of  closure
where  the  lab  was  to  be  padlocked,  culture  specimens  from  15  clients  remained  to
be  read.  They  included  hospitals,  a  government  building,  and  samples  from  a  pa-
tient’s  home.  The  lab  successfully  processed  all  these  samples,  but  since  they  re-
quired  48  to  72  hours  of  incubation,  they  could  not  be  read.  The  security  guards
would not allow staff into the laboratory. We made a plea to Mr. Moreland to allow
the culture plates to be read. He refused. We made a plea to VA Central Office; they
never  replied.  However,  Senator  Arlen  Specter  wrote  a  letter  to  Mr.  Moreland  on
our  behalf  requesting  that  the  final  15  culture  samples  be  processed.  He  ignored
that  request.  We  offered  to  transport  the  VA  cultures  to  another  laboratory.  Mr.
Moreland  refused.  Those  culture  specimens  dried  out  in  the  laboratory,  were  left
unread,  and  ultimately  trashed.  The  only  thing  that  was  needed  to  be  done  was  to
interpret the culture plates.

Ironically,  in  the  10  days  after  the  closure,  the  Pittsburgh  Tribune  Review  ran  a
front-page  story  of  accomplishments  of  the  Pittsburgh  VA  with  the  discovery  of  Le-
gionnaires’  disease.  Because  of  the  National  Legion  Convention  was  held  in  Pitts-
burgh  that  week,  Congressmen  from  Pennsylvania  attended.  The  American  Legion
knowing of our contacted Congressman Mike Doyle and Senator Arlen Specter; both
of  whom  wrote  letters  of  support.  These  letters  were  ignored  by  Mr.  Moreland  and
VA Central Office.

The  reasons  they  gave  to  the  Congressmen  and  to  the  lay  media  are  a  matter  of
record. For example, Mr. Cowgill alleged we were not processing VA specimens but
instead  processing  specimens  from  other  countries.  In  letters  from  VA  Central  Of-
fice, William Feeley, Under Secretary, claimed we were not doing any research and
that commercial labs could do the same work. These were outrageous exaggerations
and untruths.

We  have  already  furnished  documentation  showing  errors  and  the  difficulty  of
doing Legionella laboratory work. Experience, training and special equipment is nec-
essary.  We  had  become  the  premier  reference  laboratory  for  Legionella  for  the
United  States.  Not  only  were  visiting  professors  and  scientists  coming  to  the  lab,
but commercial laboratories sent their technicians to our laboratory to learn the cor-
rect  technique  as  mandated  by  the  American  Society  of  Microbiology  Manual  of
Clinical  Microbiology  written  by  Janet  Stout  and  John  D.  Rihs.  We  did  not  charge
for this teaching.

Response to VA Audit

In  response  to  the  outcry  generated  by  the  destruction  of  the  scientific  collection,
the VA claimed that I had conducted non-approved research studies. The conducted
an  audit  which  was  never  shown  or  discussed  with  me.  I  obtained  a  copy  of  this
audit  from  congressional  investigators.  In  this  biased  audit  of  39  articles  and  11
projects,  not  a  single  study  was  found  to  be  non-approved.  The  audit  by  the  Pitts-
burgh  VA  administrators  showed  numerous  errors  that  were  obvious  and  blatant.
Some examples:

Seven  articles  were  cited  as  having  no  documentation  for  VA  approval  involved
no  VA  patients  and  were  not  performed  at  the  VA  (one  of  these  studies  involved
no patients whatsoever and would not be covered by human subject review).

Six articles were cited as having no documentation. Yet Appendix B contained the

documentation for all of these articles.

Ten  articles  were  cited  as  having  no  documentation  were  observational  studies
that  did  not  fall  under  human  subject  research  as  defined  by  federal  code.  So  no
approvals were required.

Two articles were cited as having no documentation. However, the articles did not
involve  any  patient  contact  or  physician  intervention,  and  therefore  would  not  re-
quire human rights approval.

Three  articles  involved  clinical  trials  and  intervention  which  would  require  IRB

and R&D approval. The audit showed that all three were approved.

Articles  by  Dr.  Yu  that  were  funded  via  VA  Merit  Review  and  would,  of  course,

be approved by the VA R&D committee were not included in the audit.

In Appendix B, 11 Projects were reviewed. All 11 Projects were approved by R&D
and/or  IRB.  Missing  forms  were  cited,  although  it  was  clear  that  the  studies  were
approved  by  R&D  and  IRB.  Since  approval  was  given,  these  forms  were  either  lost
by the R&D Committee or overlooked by the auditor.

For full details, see Appendix. Response to VA Publication Audit by Victor L. Yu.
The  sheer  number  and  the  blatancy  of  these  errors  are  consistent  with  a  witch

hunt conducted by a biased VA administration.

Klebsiella and Levofloxacin studies were cited inaccurately as unapproved. Details

of the studies are summarized below.

Klebsiella—a virulent Klebsiella discovered by us in an international antibiotic re-
sistance  study  was  found  in  Taiwan  but  not  elsewhere.  In  the  past  five  years,  pa-
tients  who  are  Asian  have  been  found  to  have  a  similar  disease  in  the  U.S.  Two
critically-ill patients were referred to us who were non-Asians and had not traveled
outside  of  the  U.S.  Examination  of  the  molecular  type  of  these  Klebsiella  showed
that were identical to the Taiwan Klebsiella. This Klebsiella is now in the U.S. Our
entire collection of Klebsiella collected in two large-scale studies in the U.S. and all
six  inhabitable  continents  was  destroyed.  We  lost  the  ability  to  compare  the  molec-
ular  characteristics  of  the  Klebsiella  in  our  collection  with  those  of  newly-infected
patients.  Study  of  our  original  collection  and  new  Klebsiella  would  allow  us  to  de-
velop antibiotics and vaccines. (See Appendix—Approval from Request to Review Re-
search Proposal for ‘‘Pathogenicity of Klebsiella’’)

Levofloxacin:  Janet  Stout  found  a  new  compound  from  OrthoMcNeil  to  be  highly
effective  in  the  lab  against  Legionella.  This  compound  was  brought  to  clinical  use
and  in  the  first  trial  of  pneumonia,  the  compound  cured  an  amazing  100  percent
of  patients  with  LD.  This  experience  was  reported  and  the  compound  was  released
as  levofloxacin.  Four  years  later,  levofloxacin  was  used  in  a  huge  outbreak  of  LD
in  Spain.  One  hundred  percent  cure.  All  of  our  Legionella  isolates  were  destroyed.
(See Appendix—Response to publication audit. Project 9. Documentation of approval
of ‘‘Levaquin Community-Acquired Pneumonia’’)

In  summary,  this  massive  collection  of  more  than  8,000  microbes  (5,000
Legionella, 300 species of other bacteria and fungi), 3,000 patient sera, and 202 pa-
tient  specimens  (urine,  respiratory  tract)  was  destroyed  without  warning.  The  VA
administration never even confirmed that this collection had been destroyed despite
repeated  requests.  The  collection  was  unique  in  that  the  microbes  and  specimens
were  linked  to  the  clinical  histories  of  the  patients  who  were  infected  by,  these  mi-
crobes.

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Dr. Yu.
Dr. Snydman.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  DAVID  R.  SNYDMAN,  CHIEF,  DIVISION  OF
GEOGRAPHIC  MEDICINE  AND  INFECTIOUS  DISEASES,  AND
ATTENDING  PHYSICIAN  IN  INFECTIOUS  DISEASES,  DEPART-
MENT  OF  MEDICINE,  TUFTS  MEDICAL  CENTER;  PROFESSOR
OF  MEDICINE  AND  MICROBIOLOGY,  TUFTS  UNIVERSITY
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE
Dr.  SNYDMAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the
Committee.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me.  I  am  Dr.  David  Snydman.
I  am  Chief  of  the  Division  of  Geographic  Medicine  and  Infectious
Diseases  at  Tufts  Medical  Center  in  Boston  and  professor  of  medi-
cine  and  microbiology  at  Tufts  University  School  of  Medicine.  I
offer my CV, which outlines my training and expertise in the fields
of  microbiologic  research  as  well  as  clinical  research  within  the
field of infectious disease.

Due to time constraints, I will not go into details about my train-
ing  or  publication  record,  which  are  listed  on  my  CV,  but  I  will
state  for  the  record  that  I  conduct  studies  in  infectious  diseases
using  the  microbiology  laboratory  and  I  am  nationally  and  inter-
nationally  recognized  for  my  research.  I  have  been  funded  by  the
NIH for many years for many of the studies that I have published.
I have collaborated with Victor Yu in a variety of studies conducted
over the past 20 years or more. Many of these have been published
in  the  highest-level  journals  within  the  field  of  clinical  infectious
diseases and microbiology.

Let me also state that I have publicly praised the VA health care
system  in  an  editorial  I  wrote  for  the  Mayo  Clinic  proceedings  re-
garding quality of care around central line-associated infections, so
I  come  to  this  proceeding  as  someone  who  recognizes  the  value  of
the  VA  health  care  system.  I  have  never  been  an  employee  of  the
VA  but  have  worked  as  a  medical  resident  at  the  Boston  VA  and
volunteered  in  the  Atlanta  VA  while  I  was  employed  by  the  Cen-
ters  for  Disease  Control.  I  am  trying  to  offer  as  dispassionate  and
objective an opinion as possible.

I have been asked by the staff to comment on a number of issues
pursuant  to  these  proceedings  including  the  value  of  the  resource
of the Special Pathogens Laboratory in the Pittsburgh VA Hospital
as  well  as  the  studies  which  were  foreclosed  by  the  destruction  of
the isolates and the value of the research conducted by Drs. Yu and
Stout. I have also been asked as to how I learned of the destruction
of the isolates housed in the Special Pathogens Laboratory, to com-
ment  on  my  actions  and  to  comment  on  changes  in  policies  Con-
gress  should  consider  in  order  to  prohibit  such  actions  from  hap-
pening  in  the  future.  First,  let  me  say  from  the  outset  that  the
question  should  be  broadened  to  include  isolates  other  than
Legionella since many of the isolates the Special Pathogens Labora-
tory  housed  were  microbiologic  species  of  bacteria  and  fungi  other
than Legionella.

I first learned there was a problem in the Special Pathogens Lab-
oratory  in  July  of  2006.  I  actually  called  Dr.  Yu  in  late  June  or
early  July  of  that  year  to  discuss  a  case  of  a  very  rare  disease,
Legionella endocarditis. I wanted him to try to isolate the organism
from  a  heart  valve  that  needed  to  be  replaced  in  a  patient  I  was
consulting on. Our laboratory had not been able to isolate the orga-
nism but there was a strong suspicion that Legionella was causing
the  disease  based  on  a  number  of  clinical  factors.  Since  treatment
requires  six  months  or  more  of  therapy,  I  wanted  to  get  as  defini-
tive  an  answer  as  possible.  I  knew  that  Dr.  Yu  had  the  expertise
to perform specialized studies on the valve including the use of mo-
lecular  diagnostic  tools.  He  told  me  that  he  would  try  to  perform
the  studies,  to  hold  onto  the  blood  cultures  and  he  would  give  me
instructions  as  to  how  to  send  them.  After  some  time  he  told  me
he would not be able to perform the studies and indicated the lab-
oratory  would  be  shut  down.  I  was  quite  disturbed  and  asked  if
there was anything I could do. I subsequently wrote to the VA hos-
pital administration in Pittsburgh protesting this action as well as
Senator Specter and some in the Pennsylvania Congressional Dele-
gation. I later found out, much to my dismay, that the isolates from
the  whole  collection  were  destroyed.  I  eventually  wrote  the  view-
points piece for the journal Clinical Infectious Disease, which is the
official clinical journal of the Infectious Disease Society of America.
I have appended this article for submission with my testimony.

With respect to the research done by Drs. Yu and Stout, one can
only  conclude  that  it  is  of  the  highest  caliber  in  the  world.  They
are  internationally  recognized  for  their  work  and  expertise  in
Legionella  as  well  as  other  pathogens  and  their  laboratory  set  the
standard  for  our  understanding  of  the  environmental  control  for
Legionella.  If  I  may  read  into  the  record  part  of  the  viewpoints
piece, I believe the Committee will get a flavor for the value of the
collection.  ‘‘Dr.  Yu  established  a  series  of  national  and  inter-
national collaborations to elucidate our understanding of the micro-
biological  and  clinical  management  issues  of  bacteremia  due  to
many different organisms. These studies were seminal in many re-
spects.  They  changed  our  understanding  of  the  relationship  be-
tween  appropriate  and  inappropriate  therapy,  the  relationship  be-
tween  the  minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  of  isolates  to  anti-
microbial agents in outcome, and the molecular epidemiology of re-
lapse  and  re-infection  as  well  as  relatedness  of  strains  throughout

the  world.  The  studies  are  far  too  numerous  to  articulate  in  detail
or  even  list  here  in  total  but  they  include  studies  of  the  major
pathogens that confound us today including Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  extended  spectrum  beta-lactamase  pro-
ducing 
species,
Stenotrophomona  maltophilia,  Enterococcus  species,  Bacteroides
fragilis,  Streptococcus  pneumoniae,  and  Candida  species.  The  con-
cept  was  simple:  observe  the  clinical  presentation  of  bacteremia  or
fungemia  and  follow  outcomes  while  correlating  microbiology  to
outcome.  The  studies  were  prospective,  and  all  the  isolates  were
collected  and  sent  to  a  central  laboratory,  the  Pittsburgh  VA  Spe-
cial Pathogens Laboratory, for more definitive analysis. Each of the
studies  emanating  from  this  collection  has  changed  our  knowledge
base  and  contributed  significantly  towards  optimal  management  of
patients  with  these  infections.  Capturing  the  isolates  and  making
sure they were sent was an important and difficult task, especially
for  fastidious  organisms  like  Strep  pneumoniae  and  Bacteroides
species.  Given  the  international  component  as  well  as  the  require-
ments for sending specimens across national borders, these studies
were  difficult  to  perform.  All  studies  were  approved  as  per  local
IRB  requirements  and  permits  were  obtained  from  regulatory  au-
thorities.  Nevertheless,  the  number  of  studies  and  important  in-
sights total well over 100 peer-reviewed articles and have provided
important  information  that  correlate  outcome  with  the  use  of  cer-
tain  antibiotic  classes  as  well  as  levels  of  susceptibility.  Some  of
the  studies  have  challenged  prevailing  dogma  and  helped  provide
data for the CLSI, the Clinical Lab Standards Institute.’’

I  go  on  to  point  out,  ‘‘These  isolates  were  accrued  purely  for  the
advancement  of  science  and  beneficiaries  of  these  studies  were  the
patients  infected  by  these  microbes.  Moreover,  these  isolates  and
samples  would  have  proven  invaluable  in  the  future  in  that  these
strains would enable comparison over time for changes in pathogen
virulence,  antimicrobial  susceptibility  correlation  with  outcome,
and  changing  genetic  diversity  as  well  as  the  development  of  new
molecular tests.’’

The  value  of  the  collection  is  that  it  was  linked  to  clinical  out-
comes. This kind of collection does not really exist anywhere in the
world,  and  these  studies  are  really  quite  difficult  to  organize  and
complete. The reason this is so important is that one can correlate
microbiologic factors to clinical outcomes, and with a large number
of patients and specimens to study, one can control for confounding
variables such as underlying host factors which might relate to the
clinical  outcome.  The  Committee  should  note  that  one  of  our  stud-
ies on pneumococcal bacteremia was given a national award at the
annual  meeting  of  the  Infectious  Disease  Society,  the  Emmanuel
Linskey Award, as the best clinical paper for the year.

The studies which were foreclosed by the destruction of these iso-
lates  included  any  study  of  new  pathogenic  factors  that  might  be
related  to  microbial  pathogenesis  in  a  variety  of  organisms  chang-
ing microbial diversity, which we recognize as continually evolving,
and  factors  that  might  relate  to  antimicrobial  resistance  and  sus-
ceptibility. While these organisms exist in nature and can be grown
from  the  environment  as  well  as  people,  the  fact  that  there  was  a
collection  of  organisms  linked  to  outcomes  made  the  collection  in-

valuable  to  science.  It  would  have  been  relatively  simple  to  main-
tain the collection since many organisms are maintained in freezers
in  a  holding  solution.  Some  agreement  should  have  been  entered
into  between  the  parties  that  wanted  to  close  the  lab  and  Drs.  Yu
and  Stout  in  order  to  give  them  time  to  make  arrangements  for
transport  of  the  specimens  to  another  laboratory.  To  just  destroy
the specimens as was done was a wanton, thoughtless act. It is for
this  reason  that  I  wrote  my  viewpoints  piece  for  publication  and
appended a petition which has been signed by a number of clinical
and  microbiologic  research  scientists  throughout  the  world,  and  I
am happy to attend these proceedings. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID R. SNYDMAN

I  am  Dr.  David  R.  Snydman,  MD,  Chief  of  the  Division  of  Geographic  Medicine
and  Infectious  Diseases,  Tufts  Medical  Center,  Boston,  MA  and  Professor  of  Medi-
cine  and  Microbiology,  Tufts  University  School  of  Medicine.  I  offer  my  C.V.,  which
outlines  my  training  and  expertise  in  the  fields  of  microbiologic  research,  as  well
as  clinical  research  within  the  field  of  infectious  diseases.  Due  to  time  constraints
I  will  not  go  into  details  about  my  training  or  publication  record  which  are  listed
on my C.V., but I will say for the record that I conduct studies in infectious diseases

of  the  isolates  housed  in  the  Special  Pathogens  laboratory,  to  comment  on  my  ac-
tions,  and  to  comment  on  changes  and  policies  Congress  should  consider  in  order
prohibiting such actions from happening in the future.

First, let me say from the outset that the question should be broadened to include
isolates  other  than  Legionella,  since  many  of  the  isolates  housed  in  the  Special
Pathogens  laboratory  were  microbiologic  species  of  bacteria  and  fungi  other  than
Legionella.

I  first  learned  that  there  was  a  problem  in  the  Special  Pathogens  laboratory  in
July 2006. I actually called Dr. Yu in late June or early July of that year to discuss
a case of a very rare disease, Legionella endocarditis. I wanted him to try to isolate
the organism from a heart valve that needed to be replaced in a patient I was con-
sulting  on.  Our  laboratory  had  not  been  able  to  isolate  the  organism  but  there  was
a strong suspicion that Legionella was causing the disease based on several factors.
Since  treatment  requires  six  months  or  more  of  therapy,  I  wanted  to  get  as  defini-
tive an answer as possible. I knew that Dr. Yu had the expertise to perform special-
ized  studies  on  the  valve,  including  the  use  of  molecular  diagnostic  tools.  He  told
me  that  he  would  try  to  perform  the  studies,  to  hold  onto  the  blood  cultures  and
he would give me instructions as to how to send them. After some time, he told me
he  would  not  be  able  to  perform  the  studies  and  indicated  the  laboratory  would  be
shut down. I was quite disturbed and asked if there was anything I could do. I sub-
sequently  wrote  to  the  VA  hospital  administration  in  Pittsburgh  protesting  this  ac-
tion,  as  well  as  Senator  Specter  and  some  in  the  Pennsylvania  Congressional  Dele-
gation.  I  later  found  out,  much  to  my  dismay,  that  the  isolates  from  the  whole  col-
lection were destroyed. I eventually wrote the Viewpoints piece for the journal Clin-
ical Infectious Disease, which is the official clinical journal of the Infectious Disease

Society of America. I have appended the Viewpoints article for submission with my
testimony.

With respect to the research done by Dr. Yu and Dr. Stout, one can only conclude
that it is of the highest caliber in the world. They are internationally recognized for
their work and expertise in Legionella as well as other pathogens and their labora-
tory  set  the  standard  for  our  understanding  of  the  environmental  control  for
Legionella.  If  I  may  read  into  the  record  part  of  the  Viewpoints  piece,  I  believe  the
Committee will get a flavor for the value of the collection.

‘‘Dr.  Yu  established  a  series  of  national  and  international  collaborations  to  eluci-
date  our  understanding  of  the  microbiologic  and  clinical  management  issues  of
bacteremia  due  to  many  different  organisms.  These  studies  were  seminal  in  many
respects.  They  changed  our  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  appropriate
and  inappropriate  therapy,  the  relationship  between  the  minimum  inhibitory  con-
centrations  of  isolates  to  outcome,  and  the  molecular  epidemiology  of  relapse  and
reinfection  as  well  as  relatedness  of  strains  throughout  the  world.  The  studies  are
far  too  numerous  to  articulate  in  detail  or  even  list  here  in  total,  but  they  include
studies  of  the  major  pathogens  that  confound  us  today,  including  Staphylococcus
aureus  (6–8),  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  (9),  extended  spectrum  beta-lactamase  pro-
ducing  Klebsiella  pneumoniae  (10–12)  Enterobacter  species  (13),  Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia  (14),  Enterococcus  species  (15,16),  Bacteroides  fragilis  (17),  Strepto-
coccus  pneumoniae  (18–20),  and  Candida  species  (21–23).  The  concept  was  simple,
observe  the  clinical  presentation  of  bacteremia  or  fungemia,  and  follow  outcomes
while  correlating  the  microbiology  to  the  outcome.  The  studies  were  all  prospective
and the isolates collected and sent to a central laboratory (the Pittsburgh VA special
pathogens  laboratory)  for  more  definitive  analysis.  Each  of  the  studies  emanating
from  this  collection  has  changed  our  knowledge  base  and  contributed  significantly
towards optimal management of patients with these infections.

Capturing the isolates and making sure they were sent was an important and dif-
ficult  task—especially  for  fastidious  organisms  like  S.  pneumoniae  and  Bacteroides
species.  Given  the  international  component,  as  well  the  requirements  for  sending
specimens across national borders, these studies were difficult to perform. All stud-
ies  were  approved  as  per  local  IRB  requirements  and  permits  were  obtained  from
regulatory  authorities.  Nevertheless,  the  number  of  studies  and  important  insights
total  well  over  a  100  peer-review  articles  and  have  provided  important  information
that  correlates  outcome  with  the  use  of  certain  antibiotic  classes  as  well  as  levels
of  susceptibility.  Some  of  the  studies  have  challenged  prevailing  dogma  and  helped
provide data for the CLSI.

I also go on to point out ‘‘These isolates were accrued purely for the advancement
of  science  and  the  beneficiaries  of  these  studies  were  the  patients  infected  by  these
microbes. Moreover, these isolates and samples would have proven invaluable in the
future  in  that  these  strains  would  enable  comparison  over  time  for  changes  in
pathogen  virulence,  antimicrobial  susceptibility  correlation  with  outcome,  and
changing genetic diversity as well as the development of new molecular tests.’’

The  value  of  the  collection  is  that  it  was  linked  to  clinical  outcomes.  This  kind
of collection does not really exist anywhere in the world and these studies are really
quite difficult to organize and complete. The reason this is so important is that one
can  correlate  microbiologic  factors  to  clinical  outcomes,  and  with  a  large  number  of
patients  and  specimens  to  study,  one  can  control  for  confounding  variables  such  as
underlying  host  factors,  which  might  relate  to  the  clinical  outcome.  The  committee
should  also  note  that  one  of  our  studies  on  pneumococcal  bacteremia  was  given  a
national award at the annual meeting of the Infectious Disease Society of America,
the  Emanual  Wolinsky  award,  as  the  best  clinical  paper  for  the  year.  The  studies
which were foreclosed by the destruction of these isolates included any study of new
pathogenic  factors  that  might  be  related  to  microbial  pathogenesis  in  a  variety  of
organisms, changing microbial diversity which we recognize as continually evolving,
and  factors  that  might  relate  to  antimicrobial  resistance  and  susceptibility.  While
these organisms exist in nature and can be grown from the environment as well as
people,  the  fact  that  there  was  a  collection  of  organisms  linked  to  outcomes  made
the collection invaluable to science.

It  would  have  been  relatively  simple  to  maintain  the  collection  since  many  orga-
nisms are maintained in freezers in a holding solution. Some agreement should have
been  entered  into  between  the  parties  that  wanted  to  close  the  lab  and  Dr.  Yu  and
Dr.  Stout  in  order  to  give  them  time  to  make  arrangements  for  transport  of  the
specimens  to  another  laboratory.  To  just  destroy  the  specimens  as  was  done  was  a
wanton  thoughtless  act.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  I  wrote  my  Viewpoints  piece  for
publication  and  appended  a  petition  which  has  been  signed  by  a  number  of  clinical
and microbiologic research scientists throughout the world.

DISCUSSION

THE LABELING AND CATALOGING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

SCIENTIFIC COLLECTION

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Dr. Snydman.
I  understand  that  Mr.  Moreland  will  testify.  His  written  testi-
mony  submitted  last  night  asserts  that  none  of  the  samples  were,
and  this  is  a  quote  from  the  testimony,  ‘‘collected,  labeled,  cata-
loged  and  properly  stored  to  constitute  a  scientific  collection.’’  One
of  the  people  who  cleaned  out  the  refrigerators  at  the  lab  on  De-
cember 4 said that the individual vials had numbers, both numbers
and  letters  on  them,  and  Dr.  Stout  has  attached  to  her  testimony
a  catalog  that  looks,  to  our  staff,  who  have  more  expertise  than  I
do,  like  a  thorough  catalog.  Is  that  how  samples  are  collected,  la-
beled, cataloged and stored to constitute a scientific collection?

Dr. SNYDMAN. Are you asking me?
Chairman MILLER. Yes, Dr. Snydman.
Dr.  SNYDMAN.  Absolutely.  They  typically  will  have  a  laboratory
number  that  will  refer  in  a  notebook  or  some  other  central  reposi-
tory the linkage. For a couple of reasons that is done. One is to pro-
tect  the  identity  of  the  individual  from  whom  the  isolate  has  been
obtained,  and  also  to  have  kind  of  a  linear  catalog  that  can  refer
to  specimens  and  they  are  usually  grouped  in  boxes  in  freezers  so
that they can be ascertained for subsequent analyses as needed. So
that is very typical.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  And  Dr.  Stout,  were  the  numbers

and letters part of our cataloging of the collection?

Ms. STOUT. Yes, and for those of you who have never seen a sci-
entific  collection,  I  wanted  to  show  you  with  this  visual  aid.  There
are 81 little compartments in these boxes and this is what a freezer

vial, and what we would write on the side is the number and some
information  about  the  material  in  there.  We  would  write  the  same
number  on  the  top  so  that  when  someone  went  into  the  box,  they
could  see  easily  where  they  wanted  to  go  to  find  the  isolate,  and
then  each  of  these  boxes  was  put  into  a  stainless  steel  rack  and
that  rack  held  20  individual  boxes.  Our  collection  of  microorga-
nisms were stored in this very orderly manner.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay,  and  that  is  a  standard  procedure  in

cataloging?

Ms.  STOUT.  That  is  a  standard  procedure,  and  in  our  procedure
manual—which the laboratory service had, because we were under
laboratory  service  when  we  were  performing  clinical  testing—it  is
the standard operating procedure describing that process.

Chairman  MILLER.  Your  testimony  has  established  well,  as  has
our  staff  report,  that  there  was  a  great  deal  of  peer-reviewed  re-
search  that  resulted  from  research  on  this  collection.  Is  a  proper
catalog of samples necessary for peer-reviewed research, Dr. Stout?
Ms.  STOUT.  Absolutely.  One  of  the  examples  that  I  provided  to
the  Committee  was  a  paper  where  we  were  using  new  molecular
tests to link the organisms from hospital water systems to patients.
It  is  called  pulse  field  gel  electrophoresis.  And  that  group  of  orga-
nisms  was  retrievable  from  the  freezer  because  we  had  cataloged
those organisms and we could go back and use new tests to evalu-
ate  those  new  tests,  and  in  fact,  we  have  had  requests  from  other
scientists  for  those  very  organisms,  and  in  the  publication  is  the
stock  number  that  is  on  the  vial  in  the  freezer  and  those  individ-
uals  in  other  countries  have  asked  for  those  organisms  for  further
study.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Snydman,  do  you  agree  with  what  Dr.
Stout  just  said?  Is  proper  cataloging  a  necessary  part  of  peer-re-
viewed research?

Dr. SNYDMAN. Yes, I would say absolutely.
Chairman  MILLER.  So  if  this  collection  were  not  properly  cata-
loged,  it  would  not  have  resulted  in  the  number  of  peer-reviewed
articles that it appears to have resulted in?

Dr. SNYDMAN. Absolutely.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Dr.  Stout,  when  did  you  first  hear
these criticisms of your collection, that it wasn’t done scientifically,
it  wasn’t  collected  or  labeled  or  cataloged  or  properly  stored  to
make it a real scientific collection?

Ms. STOUT. I believe I was told that by the Committee staff after
they  had  conducted  interviews,  and  I  didn’t  find  that  to  be  a  cred-
ible statement.

Chairman MILLER. You never heard it from Dr. Melhem?
Ms. STOUT. No.
Chairman MILLER. You never heard it from Mr. Moreland?
Ms.  STOUT.  No,  and  I  never  had  any  direct  conversations  with
them. I believe they have claimed that they asked me for informa-
tion  about  the  catalog  collection  and  no  one  from  either  the  re-
search  department  or  the  clinical  laboratory  asked  me  for  specific
information.  When  I  was  in  the  process  of  working  with  the  re-
search  group  to  make  the  transfer,  all  they  were  concerned  about
was  the  paperwork  and,  you  know,  they  were  apparently  trying  to
help me do that.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Yu,  when  did  you  first  hear  these  criti-
cisms of how your collection was cataloged, that it wasn’t scientific?
Dr.  YU.  I  wrote  many  communications  to  them,  and  the  letters
are  documented  in  the  Appendix.  I  never  heard  anything  from
them,  and  I  never  heard  this  particular  excuse  used  to  justify  de-
struction of the organisms.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Melhem never told you before or told you

to your face or even in an e-mail, that is——

Dr. YU. That is right.
Chairman  MILLER.—kind  of  like  to  your  face,  that  there  was
some  failure  in  the  way  that  the  collection  was  collected,  labeled
and cataloged and stored?

Dr.  YU.  Yes.  I  never  had  any  communication  with  Dr.  Melhem.
Chairman  MILLER.  My  five  minutes  have  expired.  Mr.  Rohr-

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  and
again,  I  appreciate  your  leadership  in  directing  your  staff  to  come
to this as early as you obviously have. I am a former journalist and
I  remind  people  that  journalists  really,  we  know  this  much  about
that  much,  but  we  don’t  know  this  much  about  anything,  and  I
have  to  admit,  some  of  the  words  that  were  being  used  today,  I
don’t know what those words were and I am a man of words.

Chairman MILLER. I thought that Dr. Snydman was just showing

off.

THE SPECIAL PATHOGENS LABORATORY (SPL)

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  let  me  ask  a  couple  questions  here  about
the nature of your laboratory. There are two natures to the labora-
tory  that  we  are  talking  about.  One  is  a  research  component  and
the other is a diagnostic and clinical component that basically serv-
ices other hospitals. Is that right?

Dr.  YU.  I  was  also  head  of  the  Clinical  Microbiology  Laboratory
and that laboratory handles specimens from the local VA hospitals,
and then I was also head of the Special Pathogens Laboratory and
that  is  a  research  laboratory.  However,  since  we  had  outbreaks  of
Legionnaires’  disease  within  our  own  hospital  initially,  sometimes
there  was  interaction  between  the  two.  But  the  publications  and
the  personnel  in  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  were  the  main
component of the research.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  The  research  has  been  going  on  since  1976,

or how long?

Dr.  YU.  The  Special  Pathogens  Lab  really  started  in  approxi-

mately 1979 to 1980, and that was when——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay,  so  it  has  been  going  on  since  1979  or

1980 and that is——

Dr. YU. Yes.
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—28 years, almost 30 years now.
Dr. YU. Yes.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  And  during  that  time  period,  you  have  man-
aged  to  actually  discover  the  cause  of  Legionnaires’  disease  and
identify this—what do you call it, bacilli or——

Ms. STOUT. Bacteria.

338

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay,  bacteria,  that  actually  has  resulted  in
these deaths and these horrible problems for people. How long ago
was it that that was discovered?

Dr. YU. Janet made the first discovery that it could be contracted
from hospital water. It was published in 1982 in the New England
Journal of Medicine and in 1983 in the Lancet.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So,  number  one,  let  me  just  note,  I,  like  ev-
erybody  else,  thought  it  was  the  air  conditioning  up  until  right
now. If indeed you come to a point where you have identified what
the cause is and you have had over 20 years of research into that,
was  there  a  need  for  further  research  as  compared  to  utilizing  the
resources  for  diagnostic  and  helping  with  specific  patients?  Was
there a need for further research on this?

Dr.  YU.  As  a  specific  example,  microbes  are  evolving  and  anti-
biotic  resistance  is  now  a  major  problem,  and  it  turns  out  actually
just  two  days  ago  we  received  commentary  from  one  of  my  col-
leagues  in  France.  They  believe  that  Legionella  has  the  capability
to evolve resistant to levofloxacin, and they wanted us to test their
hypothesis with the organisms that we had in our collection.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. So the actual—the discovery was made years
ago  but  the  ongoing  research  is  vitally  important  because  these
things,  these  bacteria  change  and  we  need  to  keep  on  top  of  it.  Is
that it basically?

Dr. YU. Exactly.
Ms.  STOUT.  And  if  I  may  just  add,  in  addition  to  therapy  and
treatment, we are also and have been for many years trying to put
the  tools  in  the  toolbox  to  prevent  the  disease,  which  includes
treatment  of  water  distribution  systems  with  various  methods  to
control  the  presence  of  the  bacteria  in  water,  and  just  like  with
antibiotics,  there  is  no  perfect  solution  so  we  continuously  do  re-
search to perfect those techniques.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Let  me  note,  I  think  that  is  very  worthy  re-
search. We are going to be talking to someone in the Veterans Ad-
ministration  who  you  have  been  pointing  to,  decisions  that  he
made, later on. What if he tells us that that research is something
that he supports but isn’t within his budget?

Ms.  STOUT.  Well,  I  am  sure  Dr.  Yu  has  something  to  say,  but
what is interesting to me is that in the September issue of Clinical
Infectious Diseases, there is a report demonstrating that there is an
increase  in  the  incidence  or  the  number  of  cases  of  Legionnaires’
disease  that  have  been  noted,  and  that  document  is,  I  believe,  the
last document in your report here.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  First  of  all,  let  me  just  say  that  I  would  be
supportive of this research. This research sounds like it is very im-
portant.  I  am  trying  to  make  sure  that  we  are  not  totally
villainizing  a  man  who  we  have  given,  and  people  we  have  given
the responsibility to run certain budgets and——

Ms.  STOUT.  Well,  I  think  the  other  point  to  be  made  is  that  vet-

erans are disproportionately affected by this disease.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And——
Dr.  YU.  And  one  other  point.  We  receive  funding  from  industry
for  the  levofloxacin  study  and  actually  the  first  effective  disinfec-
tion  measure  was  placed  at  the  Pittsburgh  VA.  The  Los  Angeles
VA  tried  some  things  but  the  solution  came  from  Pittsburgh.  All

of  those  disinfection  systems  were  put 
in  gratis,  and  the
levofloxacin  and  azithromycin,  the  other  major  antibiotic  that  we
discovered  effective  for  Legionnaires’  disease,  VA  patients  got  the
medicine for free from the pharmaceutical industry. So we actually
brought  funding  into  the  Pittsburgh  VA,  and  that  was  one  of  the
reasons  that  we  were  made  a  special  clinical  resource  center  be-
cause we were—we could actually bring in funds.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  again,  it  sounds  like  the  research  is
really important and I have no doubt, and I would imagine no one
disagrees  with  that,  that  the  research  is  very  important.  You  also
serve an important function in your diagnostic help for people who
actually have contracted that, and sometimes we do give people the
authority  to  try  to  make  decisions  based  on—and  budget  decisions
sometimes  lead  people  to  do  crazy  things,  so  we  will  have  to  take
a look and hear the whole testimony, but thank you very much and
thank you for your good work. I know you have saved lots of lives.
I appreciate that very much.

Ms. STOUT. Thank you.
Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Rohrabacher.
Dr. Broun.

WHY WAS THE SPECIAL PATHOGENS LABORATORY CLOSED?

Mr.  BROUN.  I  want  to  remind  my  colleague  from  California  that

we are all ignorant about some things.

I  thank  you  all  for  y’all’s  work.  I  am  a  practicing  physician,  and
I certainly understand the importance of the clinical work that you
are  doing  and  how  levofloxacin  and  azithromycin  have  been  very
instrumental  in  treating  not  only  Legionnaires’  disease  but  many
others  that  my  patients  have  enjoyed  the  fruits  of  y’all’s  efforts.  I
would  like  to  ask  Dr.  Yu  and  Dr.  Stout  individually,  why  do  you
think y’all’s lab was closed?

Dr. YU. We asked that question in writing and it is the letter in
the appendix, why would you do this. I did want to say it had noth-
ing  to  do  with  funds  because  we  were  bringing  in  funds  from  EPA
and  industry  and  so  forth,  and  other  laboratories  that  needed  the
work,  they  actually  paid  a  small  fee  too.  I  don’t  know  the  answer
but  I  think  the  people  behind  me  can  answer  that  question.  It  is
inexplicable why that happened.

Mr. BROUN. Dr. Stout, do you have any knowledge or even specu-

lation why the lab was closed?

Ms. STOUT. I think probably most of the people reading the infor-
mation  that  has  been  provided  and  collected  by  the  staff  come
down to the same question that you are asking because it is essen-
tially  inexplicable,  given  the  value  of  the  laboratory,  not  only  for
the  clinical  laboratory  but  the  other  infectious  disease  physicians
that were practicing not only at the Pittsburgh VA but nationwide.
We  served  that  function  and  we  supported  them  not  only  with  re-
gard  to  Legionella  detection  and  diagnosis  but  also  in  their  other
investigations  of  other  pathogens.  I  am  reminded  of  a  term  about
shortsighted  businessmen  where  they  act  before  they  actually  un-
derstand the scope and the value of that which they are proposing
to cut. So I believe that there was a failure at all levels within this
administration  to  not  only  protect  the  value  of  the  laboratory  but
the value of the collection.

Mr.  BROUN.  Are  either  of  you  familiar  with  any  of  the  processes

or procedures that are required for a VA lab closure?

Ms.  STOUT.  I  have  read  the  document  that  was  associated  with
the  research  centers  of  excellence  and  that  there  was  terminology
in  there  about  orderly  closure  and  having  plans  for  those  closures,
yes.

Mr. BROUN. Dr. Yu.
Dr.  YU.  Yes,  I  was  well  aware  of  that,  and  actually  I  had  to  go
through  an  interrogation.  I  pointed  out  the  specific  memorandum
in  my  interrogation  that  one  of  the  points  that  they  made  is  that
there  was  no  mandate  for  this  laboratory,  something  that  was
again so incredibly difficult to comprehend since the previous direc-
tor  had  actually  mandated  that,  and  I  pointed  this  out  to  Mr.
Moreland and his group.

Mr. BROUN. Do either of you all know if the policies and the pro-
cedures  for  VA  lab  closures  were  followed  in  this  case  with  SPL?
Dr. YU. The policy says that you have to arrange for orderly clo-
sure to ensure that patients are not affected and so forth, and that
clearly wasn’t done. It was a strike of lightning that I think really
caught Senator Specter’s eye as to that just didn’t seem right, that
a  lab  that  is  there  for  30  years  is  there  on  Wednesday,  you  close
it on Friday.

Mr.  BROUN.  So  it  is  your  contention  that  those  procedures  and
policies that are put in place for VA lab closures were not followed
in this case with SPL?

Dr. YU. They were not followed.
Mr.  BROUN.  There  were  clinical  specimens  that  were  undergoing
those studies for antibiotic resistance or for identification and those
types  of  things  that  were  shut  off  without  any  final  determination
of what that isolate was, what any kind of antibiotic treatment was
or anything else. Is that correct?

Dr. YU. That is correct.
Mr.  BROUN.  Would  this,  in  your  opinion,  open  some  liability  for

patient safety?

Dr. YU. It turns out that there was a major affiliated hospital of
one  of  the  most  prestigious  universities  in  the  United  States  had
sent  specimens  to  us  and  that  individual  was  so  perturbed  when
we were unable to give him the results when all we had to do was
open the cabinet and look at it under the microscope, he wrote me
a  letter  saying  you  have  done  great  work  but  go  out  on  the  high
road, give me those results. We sent that communication to the ad-
ministration and to Senator Arlen Specter, and Specter asked them
to release the results. They let those cultures die. But I understand
a settlement was made with the Pittsburgh VA and the water con-
tractor or water consultant who had sent the specimens to our lab-
oratory,  but  that  is  what  I  heard.  So  they  paid  off  this  individual
who  actually,  I  think,  was  very,  very  concerned  about  the  implica-
tions of not following through on a commitment.

Mr.  BROUN.  Thank  you.  My  time  has  expired.  Thank  you,  Mr.

Chairman MILLER. Thank you. The Chairman welcomes both Dr.

Broun’s expertise and his use of the word ‘‘y’all.’’

I  now  recognize  myself  for  a  second  round  of  questions.  Mr.
Moreland, his written testimony and presumably his oral testimony

Chairman.

under  oath  later  today,  will  be  that  he  was  shocked,  shocked  to
learn that there was research going on in his laboratory. Dr. Stout,
I  understand  that  part  of  your  work  including  the  research  on  the
Legionella at that hospital, that VA hospital, resulted in your play-
ing  a  significant  role  in  developing  a  protocol  for  reducing  the  risk
of Legionella in the VA hospital system. Is that correct?

Ms. STOUT. That is correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Did  the  VA  embrace  that  work?  Did
they  know  that  you  were  doing  it  there?  Did  they  say  what  on
Earth were you doing, doing research.

Ms. STOUT. It is difficult for me to understand how the adminis-
tration of the hospital in which we worked was completely unaware
of  the  work  that  we  had  been  doing  for  more  than  25  years.  The
basis for the VA directive which was published in February of 2008
came  from  our  work  and  came  from  direct  collaboration  with  the
VA medical inspector general. That piece of information was among
the various pieces of information provided to the administration as
justification for our continuing to serve the VA and the Nation. So
I  am  not  sure  exactly  when  Mr.  Moreland  said  that  he  was  un-
aware  but  he  certainly  was  aware  of  our  accomplishments  includ-
ing that before they made the decision to close the laboratory.

TRANSFERRING THE SPL COLLECTION

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Just  a  couple  of  other  questions  about
Mr.  Moreland’s  written  testimony.  These  can  be  very  quick  an-
swers,  yes  or  no.  His  testimony  is  that,  ‘‘Following  a  technical  re-
view by the ACOS for clinical support, we found it presented a po-
tential  biohazard  to  both  employees  and  our  veterans.  The  SP  lab
lacked  a  defined  and  approved  research  activity.’’  Dr.  Yu  or  Dr.
Stout,  did  anyone  ever  tell  you  that  there  was  a  technical  review
and a finding that your research or the maintenance of this collec-
tion presented a potential biohazard?

Ms. STOUT. No.
Chairman MILLER. When did you first hear that?
Dr. YU. Now.
Chairman  MILLER.  Right  now  this  minute?  Okay.  Dr.  Yu,  Dr.
Stout,  you  apparently  conducted  months  of  negotiations  on  the
transfer  of  this  collection  to  another  facility  where  you  could  con-
tinue your research. Could you describe fairly briefly those negotia-
tions, Dr. Yu or Dr. Stout?

Ms. STOUT. I probably should do that because it was my commu-
nication  with  the  research  department  at  the  VA  from  August  to
December.  There  were  numerous  documents,  mostly  e-mails  be-
tween myself and the research department. The first was with Dr.
Graham,  then  Dr.  Sonel  subsequently  and  then  Dr.  Sonel  directed
one of his individuals, the research compliance officer, to work with
me to effect that transfer, and if I may just correct a misconception,
both  Dr.  Graham  and  Dr.  Sonel  each  had  conversations  with  Dr.
Melhem in which she led them to believe that it was her intention
to  destroy  the  collection.  Therefore,  they  were  forewarned.  It  was
not  the  fact  that  although  they  were  misled  in  December,  they  all
had  an  opportunity  to  protect  the  collection  as  early  as  September
when they were informed of her intention to destroy it.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Snydman,  you  have  worked  with  Dr.  Yu.
You are an infectious disease researcher yourself, which is why you
were  able  to  show  off  rattling  off  the  names  of  all  those  bacteria.
Our  second  panel  will  be  about  policies  and  protocols  of  what  per-
haps  should  happen.  It  appears  that  a  great  many  laboratories  do
not  necessarily  have  written  protocols  but  there  is  sort  of  a  habit
or  common  sense,  common  decency  of  seeing  first  if  there  is  an-
other researcher at the same institution when a researcher is leav-
ing  that  would  use  the  samples  for  their  research,  whether  the  re-
searcher  who  is  leaving  would  take  it  with  them  or  whether  it
could  be  given  to  be  somebody  else  if  there  is  no  one  there  that
would  continue  the  research  or  has  any  interest,  and  it  is  only  if
no one, no researcher appears to have any interest at all that sam-
ples  are  destroyed.  Is  that  consistent  with  your  own  impression  of
what happens?

Dr.  SNYDMAN.  I  would  say  yes.  In  general,  if  there  is  someone
who is taking over or collaborating, there would be some preserva-
tion  and  transport  of  the  specimens,  but  if  there  isn’t  anyone  else,
they might be destroyed.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Are  you  aware  of  other  instances
when  a  research  institution  destroyed  a  specimen  collection  with-
out consulting with the research staff?

Dr. SNYDMAN. No.
Chairman  MILLER.  Are  you  aware  of  any  circumstances—well,
this  seems  to  be  a  redundant  question  but  if  redundancy  is  a  sin,
all politicians are going to hell. Do you know of any circumstances
in which or can you imagine a research institution destroying a col-
lection while there were negotiations underway for what to do with
the collection?

Dr. SNYDMAN. No.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Rohrabacher.

REASONS FOR DESTROYING THE SPL COLLECTION:
PROCEDURAL FLAWS OR PERSONALITY CONFLICTS?

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, we are
novices  here  in  a  number  of  ways,  both  in  terms  of  the  subject  of
your research and also in exactly how the structure works.

First of all, I take it that your laboratory worked somewhat inde-
pendently  because—and  that  up  until  now  you  really  haven’t  had
any close relationship with top people in the Veterans Administra-
tion.

Ms.  STOUT.  I  would  say  literally  that  would  be  not  true  because
over the years I participated in numerous activities through the VA
central  office  infectious  disease  group,  as  did  Dr.  Yu,  and  we  were
asked to be lecturers and to participate in the development of guide
books on infectious diseases.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  would  that  be  people  at  the  top,  at  the
very  top  level  of  the  VA  or  just  people  who  are  operating  within
the VA?

Ms. STOUT. Not in Pittsburgh, in Washington, that——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yes, but I mean——
Ms. STOUT. Yes.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  First  of  all,  you  have  accomplished  a
lot  and  we  should  all  be  grateful  for  that,  and  when  I  mentioned

earlier  that  bureaucracy  gets  in  the  way  of  all  this  stuff,  here  in
Washington you can trace things down to just the way people oper-
ate and rules of bureaucracy within a certain parameter there, and
let me ask you this. There are controls that laboratories in the NIH
and  CDC  and  others  whose  only  area  is  research  and  not  nec-
essarily helping with hospitals like you are also doing, but there is
a  lot  of  controls  on  human  subject  research.  Now,  are  you—have
you been under that same sort of umbrella of regulations as to how
you  can  operate  as  would  happen  under  the  labs  of  NIH  or  CDC?
Ms.  STOUT.  Yes.  For  example,  the  Environmental  Protection
Agency  study  involved  interactions  with  patients  so  it  was  ap-
proved  by  the  IRB  as  well  as  the  VA  Merit  Review  study  and  nu-
merous other studies by Dr. Yu.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  So  you  are  not  just  operating  out  on

your own and——
Ms. STOUT. No.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—ignoring  what  all  the  other  labs  have  to  do

because they are under——

Ms. STOUT. No, and in fact, there was tremendous oversight over

what we did from very different bodies.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right. That is really an important element
here  because  I  think  what  we  are  being  told  is  that  somebody
asked for a raise, which got somebody’s attention, and all of a sud-
den  they  had  never—somebody  had  not  realized  that  you  existed
before.  Frankly,  if  I  had  not  realized  that  you  existed  before  and
then  heard  that  you  had  been  involved  with  such  important  work,
I would be very happy and I would have tried to be your friend and
take  credit  for  everything  you  did.  So  the  fact  is,  that  is  the  way
it works in Washington quite a bit, and instead, it seems here that
personalities  have  come  into  play  and  that  what  often  we  see  in
Washington  also  within  the  bureaucracy  is,  at  times  people  get  a
little  bit  miffed  that  their  authority  is  being  challenged  in  some
way. Do you think that there is a personality end of this about peo-
ple worrying that rather than looking at the value of what you are
doing,  that  they  were  only  looking  at  maybe  their  authority  was
being challenged?

Ms.  STOUT.  Well,  what  I  am  heartened  by  is  the  work  that  the
Chairman  and  the  Committee  will  do  to  prevent  this  from  ever
happening again.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Ms.  STOUT.  I  think  that  there  were  some  checks  and  balances
available  within  the  administration  in  Pittsburgh  to  prevent  this
from happening and they were completely disregarded.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And was that due to, as I say, people getting
miffed  or  a  personality  situation  being  brought  into  what  should
have  been  a  professional  situation,  or  was  this  a  real  flaw  in  the
system?

Ms. STOUT. I think it was both. I think hat there were people in
the administration that cared more about themselves than science,
medicine  or  veterans.  I  think  that  what  the  Committee  has  shown
and  the  hard  work  of  the  staff  is  that  the  measures  that  we  had
faith  in  and  we  were  working  in  good  faith  with  the  research  de-
partment to transfer the collection, the atmosphere in this adminis-
tration prevented them from acting respectfully and responsibly.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  certainly  any  lab  that  is  shut  down
should  be—anybody  who  is  told—with  research  as  important  as
yours  should  be  given  enough  advance  notice  that  these  type  of
problems,  that  the  disaster  that  we  are  talking  about  wouldn’t
have happened. So thank you very much.

Ms. STOUT. Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  I  think  we  have  gotten  from  you
the  particular  points  we  wanted  covered  in  your  testimony,  but  I
am a recovering lawyer, and it occurs to me that you all have been
wronged.  Obviously  others  have  been  wronged  too.  We  will  never
know  who  has  been  wronged.  We  will  never  know  that  someone
who  died  from  an  antibiotic-resistant  staph  infection  might  not
have died had your specimens not been destroyed, but you all have
been wronged professionally. Have you talked to a lawyer?

Dr. YU. I have talked to a lawyer.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Dr. YU. But so far, I am still recovering psychologically from this

blow, frankly.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  I  am  certainly  not  dispensing  legal  ad-
vice  but  my  sense  of  how  the  law  has  developed  over  the  last  sev-
eral  hundred  years  is  that  some  conduct,  some  event  strikes  us  as
unjust  in  our  viscera,  something  seems  unjust  to  us,  and  then  we
engage  our  intellect  to  explain  why  it  is  unjust,  and  from  that
comes  legal  concepts,  whether  it  is  the  law  of  property  or  of  con-
tract  or  of  tort,  you  all  have  suffered  an  injustice,  and  I  would  en-
courage  you  to  talk  about  whether  you  might  have  some  redress
from that.

Dr. YU. Are you still practicing?
Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  not.  There  is  an  election  in  less  than
two  months.  It  is  my  hope  that  I  will  have  some  continuity  of  em-
ployment here——

Ms. STOUT. You have our vote.
Chairman  MILLER.—and  I  will  be  unavailable  to  practice  law.

Thank you.

Ms. STOUT. Thank you.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Rohrabacher, anything else?
Mr. ROHRABACHER. I have one last point and that is when I first
ran for office, my most successful slogan during my first campaign
was, ‘‘Vote for Dana, at least he is not a lawyer.’’

Ms.  STOUT.  Well,  I  am  glad  you  all  have  a  sense  of  humor.  We

appreciate it very much.

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  and  I  thank  all  of  you.  We  will
now  have  our  next  panel,  and  we  will  have  about  a  two-minute
break while you all step down and the next panel steps up.

minutes  for  your  oral  testimony,  and  your  written  testimony  will
be  included  in  the  record  of  the  hearing.  When  you  complete  your
testimony,  we  will  have  questions.  Each  Member  will  have  five
minutes.  We  will  proceed  in  rounds  of  five  minutes  each.  It  is  the
practice  of  the  Subcommittee  to  take  testimony  under  oath.  Do  ei-
ther  of  you  have  an  objection  to  being  sworn  in,  to  swearing  an
oath?  Both  have  said  or  nodded  no.  The  Committee  also  provides
that  you  may  be  represented  by  counsel.  Are  either  of  you  rep-
resented  by  counsel  at  today’s  hearing?  Both  have  said  or  nodded
no.  Please  stand  and  raise  your  right  hand.  Do  you  swear  to  tell
the  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth?  Both  witnesses  did  so  swear.

STATEMENT OF DR. JIM VAUGHT, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, OFFICE
OF  BIOREPOSITORIES  AND  BIOSPECIMEN  RESEARCH,  NA-
TIONAL  CANCER  INSTITUTE,  NATIONAL  INSTITUTES  OF
HEALTH,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN  SERV-
ICES
Dr.  VAUGHT.  Thank  you,  and  good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.
Rohrabacher, Members of the Subcommittee. I am Dr. Jim Vaught,
the  Deputy  Director  of  the  Office  of  Biorepositories  and  Biospeci-
men  Research,  or  OBBR,  at  the  National  Cancer  Institute,  part  of
the  National  Institutes  of  Health,  an  agency  of  the  Department  of
Health  and  Human  Services.  I  have  been  engaged  in  the  area  of
biospecimen  research  and  biorepository  management  for  over  15
years  and  I  have  participated  in  the  development  of  a  number  of
practices and policies relevant to today’s discussion. This testimony
will  highlight  four  specific  activities  relevant  to  the  hearing  topic;
one,  the  NCI  Best  Practices  for  Biospecimen  Resources;  two,  a
trans-NIH effort to develop a policy framework for biospecimen col-
lections;  three,  the  NIH  Scientific  Directors  Subcommittee  on  Bio-
repository  Practices  and  Guidelines  within  the  Intramural  Re-
search  Program;  and  four,  the  Interagency  Working  Group  on  Sci-
entific Collections. These activities were triggered in part by the ac-
knowledgement  that  the  value  of  biospecimens  and  other  scientific
research  collections  is  not  always  recognized  and  that  these  collec-
tions need to be managed in an optimal way. Substandard practices
can have a negative impact on research studies as well as the prac-
tice of medicine.

In  September  2007,  the  HHS  produced  a  personalized  health
care  document  that  recognized  the  critical  importance  of  biospeci-
mens  to  the  research  infrastructure  that  will  support  personalized
medicine.  The  vision  of  personalized  medicine  is  one  in  which  the
standard of medical care is improved by adding an individual’s ge-
netic  and  molecular  profile  to  the  decision-making  process.  With
the support of senior NCI leadership, the OBBR worked in a highly
collaborative  manner  with  many  NIH  and  external  experts  to  de-
velop  the  NCI  Best  Practices  for  Biospecimen  Resources.  For  the
purpose  of  today’s  discussion,  the  recommendations  in  Section  C–
1 of the Best Practices concerning custodianship of specimen collec-
tions are the most relevant.

We  consider  the  custodianship  issue  to  be  so  important  that  we
sponsored  a  workshop  on  ownership  and  custodianship  issues  in
biospecimen research in October 2007 which resulted in a series of

346

more specific recommendations that we are considering for incorpo-
ration into the next version of the NCI Best Practices.

The NIH Scientific Director’s Subcommittee was formed to make
recommendations  to  the  scientific  directors  concerning  bioreposi-
tory practices and policies within the NIH intramural research pro-
gram.  As  a  result  of  the  work  of  this  subcommittee  during  2006
and  2007,  the  NIH  published  guidelines  for  human  biospecimen
storage and tracking within the NIH intramural research program.
These  guidelines  make  specific  recommendations  regarding  one,
the transfer of specimen custodianship and informed consent infor-
mation  when  the  responsible  investigator  leaves  NIH  or  when  the
custodianship  needs  to  be  changed  for  other  reasons;  and  two,  re-
porting  requirements  for  the  specimen  inventory  and  tracking  sys-
tems being used.

In  addition,  NIH  intramural  investigators  were  directed  in  a
June  2006  memorandum  to  include  in  their  institutional  review
board packages the manner that specimens are stored, tracked and
what  will  happen  to  the  specimens  at  the  completion  of  the  pro-
tocol. As a result, any decision to destroy or transfer specimens out
of  NIH  is  carefully  monitored  by  scientific  directors  as  well  as
IRBs.  At  NIH,  the  specimens  obtained  belong  to  the  government,
not  the  researcher.  Plans  to  move  materials  outside  NIH  must  in-
clude  appropriate  material  transfer  agreements  and  must  be  ap-
proved.  NIH  policy  does  not  permit  a  scientist  leaving  the  NIH  to
disperse his or her materials without review.

A  federal-wide  Interagency  Working  Group  on  Scientific  Collec-
tions  (IWGSC)  was  formed  in  response  to  a  call  from  the  White
House  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  and  the  White
House Office of Management and Budget for federal agencies to ad-
dress  the  scientific,  environmental,  societal  and  national  security
needs  for  collections.  As  we  had  found  in  our  assessment  of  the
NCI  and  NIH  collections,  the  IWGSC  survey  found  that  federal
agencies often do not have standardized, comprehensive approaches
to the long-term management and use of their scientific collections.
The  working  group  is  evaluating  recommendations  that  are  con-
sistent with NIH long-term management principles.

In conclusion, since many such collections are priceless and irre-
placeable,  adoption  of  practices  such  as  those  developed  by  NCI
and  other  groups  that  I  noted  will  be  critical  if  we  are  to  preserve
them  in  the  condition  necessary  to  make  the  scientific  discoveries
and  medical  advances  for  which  they  were  collected.  Based  on
these  considerations,  the  NCI  Best  Practices  reflect  the  following
themes  with  respect  to  developing  a  custodianship  plan  at  the  be-
ginning of a study or program: one, appoint a custodian to address
long-term  management  of  specimen  collections;  two,  manage  con-
flicts  of  interest;  three,  follow  all  applicable  regulations  and  poli-
cies;  and  four,  include  plans  for  management  after  a  study  ends,
funding  is  lost  or  similar  situations  requiring  custodianship
changes.  These  are  extremely  important  issues  concerning  critical
resources  that  are  central  to  our  biomedical  research  infrastruc-
ture.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JIM VAUGHT

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee. I am Dr. Jim Vaught, the Deputy Director of the Office of Biorepositories
and Biospecimen Research (OBBR1 ) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the Department of Health and
Human  Services  (HHS).  I  have  been  engaged  in  the  area  of  biospecimen  research
and biorepository management for over 15 years, and I have participated in the de-
velopment of a number of practices and policies relevant to today’s discussion. This
testimony will highlight four specific activities relevant to the hearing topic.

In  2007,  NCI  published  its  Best  Practices  for  Biospecimen  Resources,  which  pro-
vide  guiding  principles  that  define  state-of-the-science  biospecimen  resource  prac-
tices, promote high standards of biospecimen and data quality, and facilitate compli-
ance  with  ethical  standards  and  legal  requirements.  NCI  has  also  been  involved  in
a  trans-NIH  effort  to  develop  a  policy  framework  on  legal  and  ethical  issues  that
would  apply  to  all  NIH-supported  human  specimen  collections.  Additionally,  I  have
been  an  active  participant  in  the  NIH  Scientific  Directors  Subcommittee  on  Bio-
repository  Practices  and  Guidelines  within  the  Intramural  Research  Program,
formed  in  2006  to  address  biospecimen  storage  and  tracking  practices  and  policies
at  laboratories  at  NIH  facilities.  The  recommendations  of  this  group  are  currently
being  implemented.2 In  2005,  I  was  appointed  to  a  federal-wide  Interagency  Work-
ing Group on Scientific Collections (IWGSC). This working group is a subcommittee
of  the  Committee  on  Science  (COS),  within  the  National  Science  and  Technology
Council  (NSTC),  managed  by  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP).
Our charge has been to identify resources and requirements, including research and
development  needs,  for  long-term  stewardship  of  these  collections,  and  to  foster  co-
ordination of collections-related activities across the Federal Government.

These  aforementioned  activities—the  development  of  the  NCI  biospecimen  best
practices  document,  the  NIH  guidelines  for  the  intramural  program,  the  trans-NIH
policy framework on legal and ethical issues and the federal-wide Working Group—
were  triggered  in  part  by  the  acknowledgment  that  the  value  of  biospecimens  and
other  scientific  research  collections  is  not  always  recognized  and  that  these  collec-
tions need to be managed in an optimal way. Substandard practices can have a neg-
ative impact on research studies as well as the practice of medicine. In a September
2007  report  on  Personalized  Health  Care,3 HHS  also  recognized  the  critical  impor-
tance  of  biospecimens  to  the  research  infrastructure  that  will  support  personalized
medicine. The vision of personalized medicine is one in which the standard of med-
ical  care  is  improved  by  adding  an  individual’s  genetic  and  molecular  profile  to  the
decision-making process.

Scientists  can  now  study  cancer  at  the  most  fundamental  level,  identifying  genes
and their functions in the body, called genomics, and studying the corresponding set
of proteins programmed by the genetic code, called proteomics. At NCI we recognize
the critical role that biospecimens play in these endeavors. OBBR’s mission is to en-
sure  that  human  specimens  are  available  for  cancer  research  and  that  they  are  of
the highest quality. The OBBR is responsible for developing a common biorepository
infrastructure  that  promotes  resource  sharing  and  team  science,  in  order  to  facili-
tate  multi-institutional,  high  throughput  genomic  and  proteomic  studies.  These
types of studies will lay the groundwork that will lead us to personalized medicine.
With  the  support  of  NCI  senior  leadership,  our  office  worked  in  a  highly  collabo-
rative  manner  with  many  NIH  and  external  experts  to  develop  the  NCI  Best  Prac-
tices  for  Biospecimen  Resources.  Following  a  careful  analysis  of  NCI’s  biological
specimen  practices,  NCI  sponsored  two  workshops  in  2005  that  resulted  in  a  series
of recommendations that, along with existing guidelines, regulations and best prac-
tices  from  other  organizations,  became  the  NCI  Best  Practices.  The  Best  Practices
include  recommendations  from  technical  and  ethical/legal  standpoints.  I  have  pro-
vided the full document to the Committee, but for the purpose of today’s discussion,
the recommendations in Section C.1 of the Best Practices, concerning custodianship
of  specimen  collections,  are  the  most  relevant.  We  consider  the  custodianship  issue
to be so important that we sponsored a workshop on Ownership and Custodianship
Issues in Biospecimen Research in October 2007, which resulted in a series of more

specific  recommendations4 that  we  are  considering  for  incorporation  into  the  next
version of the NCI Best Practices.

The NIH Scientific Directors Subcommittee was formed to make recommendations
to the Scientific Directors concerning biorepository practices and policies within the
NIH  Intramural  Research  Program.  As  a  result  of  the  work  of  this  subcommittee
during  2006  and  2007,  NIH  published  Guidelines  for  Human  Biospecimen  Storage
and  Tracking  within  the  NIH  Intramural  Research  Program.  These  Guidelines
make specific recommendations regarding: 1) the transfer of specimen custodianship
and  informed  consent  information  when  the  responsible  investigator  leaves  NIH  or
when the custodianship needs to be changed for other reasons; and 2) reporting re-
quirements  for  the  specimen  inventory  and  tracking  systems  being  used.  In  addi-
tion,  NIH  intramural  investigators  were  directed  in  a  June  2006  memorandum  to
include  in  their  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  packages  the  manner  that  speci-
mens are stored, tracked, and what will happen to the specimens at the completion
of  the  protocol.5 As  a  result,  any  decision  to  destroy  or  transfer  specimens  out  of
NIH  is  carefully  monitored  by  Scientific  Directors  as  well  as  IRBs.  At  NIH,  the
specimens  obtained  belong  to  the  Government,  not  the  researcher.  Plans  to  move
materials  outside  NIH  must  include  appropriate  material  transfer  agreements  and
must  be  approved.  NIH  policy  does  not  permit  a  scientist  leaving  the  NIH  to  dis-
perse his/her materials without review.

The  federal-wide  IWGSC  was  formed  in  response  to  a  call  from  the  White  House
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the White House Office of Man-
agement  and  Budget  (OMB)  for  federal  agencies  to  address  the  scientific,  environ-
mental,  societal,  and  national  security  needs  for  collections.  The  Working  Group’s
main  activity  to  date  has  been  to  conduct  a  survey  to  examine  the  current  state  of
federal  scientific  collections  and  to  assess  general  thematic  issues  regarding  collec-
tions  management  and  stewardship.  These  collections  are  highly  variable,  from
NIH’s human biological specimens to NASA moon rock collections and Smithsonian
museum  artifacts  (for  example,  from  the  Lewis  and  Clark  Expedition).  A  report  is
being prepared to outline the Working Group’s findings. As we had found in our as-
sessment  of  the  NCI  and  NIH  collections,  the  IWGSC  survey  found  that  federal
agencies often do not have standardized, comprehensive approaches to the long-term
management  and  use  of  their  scientific  collections.  The  IWGSC  is  evaluating  rec-
ommendations that are consistent with NIH long-term management principles.

In  conclusion,  there  is  broad  agreement  that  collections  of  biological  specimens,
as  well  as  other  collections  of  materials  of  scientific  value,  are  critical  to  the  re-
search enterprises that support, among other important endeavors, advances in the
medical  and  technological  fields.  As  such,  standardized,  high  quality  management
practices  and  long-term  plans  for  custodianship  of  these  collections  are  needed.
Since  many  such  collections  are  priceless  and  irreplaceable,  adoption  of  practices
such as those developed by NCI and other groups that I noted will be critical if we
are  to  preserve  them  in  the  condition  necessary  to  make  the  scientific  discoveries
and medical advances for which they were collected. We are mindful that when pa-
tients  and  other  study  participants  agree  to  provide  blood  or  other  samples  for  a
research  study,  they  generally  do  so  with  an  expectation  that  their  tissue  will  be
used  to  provide  insight  into  the  causes  and/or  cures  of  their  disease,  or  to  advance
medical research in general.

Based on these considerations, the NCI Best Practices reflect the following themes

with respect to custodianship of biospecimens:

1. At  the  beginning  of  a  study  or  program  that  will  include  biospecimen  or
other research collections, a custodian, either a person or a governance com-
mittee, should be appointed by the institution to develop a plan for address-
ing long-term management of specimen collections.

2. Responsible  custodianship  requires  appropriate  management  of  financial  or
scientific  conflicts  of  interest  that  may  interfere  with  appropriate  judgment
concerning the proper disposition of the collection, and the most appropriate
scientific and/or medical use of the specimens.

3. All  applicable  regulations  and  policies  concerning,  for  example,  privacy,  in-
formed  consent,  and  material  transfer  must  be  followed  in  decisions  con-
cerning the disposition of specimens and data.

4. Custodianship  plans  should  state  in  detail  how  specimen  collections  will  be
managed  or  dispersed  when  funding  is  lost,  custodial  management  changes,

or  protocols  are  completed,  including  careful  consideration  of  the  future  sci-
entific value of the collection. The plan should recognize that specimens that
are no longer valuable or necessary for their original purpose may be useful
for other purposes, consistent with the requirements of informed consent and
other applicable rules and policies.

These  are  extremely  important  issues  concerning  critical  resources  that  are  cen-

tral to our biomedical research infrastructure.

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  our  views,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you,

and I would be pleased to answer any questions.

STATEMENT OF DR. JANET K.A. NICHOLSON, SENIOR ADVISOR
FOR  LABORATORY  SCIENCE,  COORDINATING  CENTER  FOR
INFECTIOUS  DISEASES,  CENTERS  FOR  DISEASE  CONTROL
AND  PREVENTION,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND
HUMAN SERVICES

I am pleased to appear before you this morning to address CDC’s
laboratory  specimen  collections.  I  would  like  to  give  a  brief  over-
view  on  CDC’s  management  of  infectious  disease  specimens  and
then I would be happy to answer your questions.

Each  year  CDC  laboratories  receive  hundreds  of  thousands  of
human  and  environmental  specimens  from  its  various  partners  in
public  health  throughout  the  United  States  and  abroad.  Many  of
these  specimens  contain  organisms  or  products  that  need  to  be
identified.  Other  specimens  are  unique  population-based  collec-
tions.  Virtually  all  of  these  specimens  are  automatically  archived
because  of  their  potential  importance  to  public  health  and  safety.
Upon  receipt  at  CDC,  specimens  are  logged  in,  tracked  and  exam-
ined. In the Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases, my coordi-
nating center, specimens are logged, tracked and reporting is man-
aged  by  an  automated  system  called  Star  Limbs.  Any  given  speci-
mens or samples we receive may be entirely consumed by the test-
ing  process  or  sufficient  quantities  may  have  been  obtained  for
storage.  In  the  case  of  diagnostics  work,  reports  of  laboratory  re-
sults  from  tests  done  on  these  samples  are  provided  to  the  sub-
mitter  or  other  appropriate  authorities.  At  times,  portions  of  the
samples  may  be  placed  in  long-term  storage  and  are  retained  for
future  use.  In  extremely  rare  circumstances,  some  of  our  archived
specimens may be destroyed because of lack of relevance, loss of vi-
ability  during  storage,  lack  of  appropriate  documentation,  space
limitations or when IRB, or the Institutional Review Board regula-
tions, require so.

Maintaining  CDC’s  world-renowned  culture  collections  of  speci-
mens  is  essential  in  carrying  out  the  agency’s  public  health  func-
tions,  that  is,  to  detect,  control  and  prevent  morbidity  and  mor-
tality from diseases. CDC manages its specimens in a manner com-
mensurate with the scientific integrity required by HHS guidelines
and  policies.  Each  collection  has  a  curator,  as  you  heard  before,
whose  responsibility  is  to  create,  maintain  and  oversee  the  use  of
these special collections. These specimen collections are unique and
unmatched  anywhere  in  the  world.  Not  only  are  they  critical  to
CDC’s  mission,  they  are  also  critical  to  our  commitment  to  the
global community to serve as a reference diagnostic center. The col-
lections  support  the  work  accomplished  in  our  nearly  30  World
Health Organization collaborating centers for reference research on
virus, bacteria, parasites and fungi.

Rare  and  irreplaceable  collections  of  specimens  are  stored  at
CDC. Some of these historical collections date back to before 1945,
which  was  before  the  era  of  antibiotics.  CDC  routinely  performs
reference  and  research  activities  on  rare  and  unusual  and  novel
bacterial  and  viral  pathogens.  This  specialized  work  requires  com-
parison  of  the  new  unknown  organism  to  isolates  of  these  archive
strains with similar characteristics. Through this work, new patho-
gens  such  as  SARS  may  be  discovered  when  novel  isolates  are
shown to be unrelated to any archived organism or DNA sequences
on  record.  We  would  not  be  able  to  conduct  our  comprehensive
work  on  pathogen  discover  without  these  valuable  strain  collec-
tions.

In  the  early  1990s,  CDC  and  the  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances
and  Disease  Registry,  or  ATSDR,  developed  a  specimen  repository

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:01 Dec 27, 2008 Jkt 043530 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 6621 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\090908\43530C SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

351

that provides for secure, long-term storage and management of our
valuable collection of specimens. The CDC–ATSDR Specimen Pack-
aging  Inventory  and  Repository,  or  CASPIR,  is  a  significant  re-
source for the management of specimen collections at CDC because
it  provides  unique  archival  space  and  utilizes  a  documented  man-
agement system for these archives. The CASPIR policy board devel-
oped  policies  which  include  admission  of  specimen  collections,  en-
suring  data  quality  and  security,  documenting  data  and  specimen
sharing,  specimen  and  data  withdrawal  and  use,  human  subjects
review  issues,  review  of  specimen  usage  and  disposal  of  unwanted
specimens, and contingency and disaster management. Each collec-
tion must be unique and not redundant of other collections already
stored.

CDC’s diagnostic laboratories are certified under the standards of
the  Clinical  Laboratory  Improvement  Amendments  of  1988,  or
CLIA. CLIA requires specific policies and procedures regarding the
collection, testing and storage of specimens. CDC conducts research
on  human  specimens.  The  research  plans  for  this  work  to  include
information  about  the  procedures  for  the  collection,  testing  and
storage of these specimens.

To protect our collections, CDC’s specimen archival storage facili-
ties and containers consist of freezers at -70 degrees centigrade and
liquid nitrogen containers that are monitored 24 hours a day, seven
days  a  week,  with  up  to  three  responsible  people  to  be  notified  in
the  case  of  an  alarm  that  would  indicate  a  problem  with  tempera-
ture  control  that  could  threaten  the  contents.  To  further  guard
some of our bacterial collection, CDC and the American Tissue Cul-
ture  Collection,  or  ATCC,  have  a  verbal  agreement  that  new  and
reclassified  strains  of  certain  bacterial  pathogens  are  placed  into
the  ATCC  collection  so  that  organisms  are  available  from  the
ATCC to all scientists for purchase to use in their research.

Specimens  at  CDC  that  are  collected  for  the  purpose  of  human
research  must  comply  with  the  basic  HHS  policy  for  protection  of
human  research  subjects.  CDC  investigators  who  collect  and  use
human specimens are required to receive training in scientific eth-
ics for investigators who engage in research using human subjects.
Unless  exempt  by  certain  classifications  identified  in  the  human
subjects research policy, all such research must be approved by an
institutional  review  board,  IRB,  prior  to  start  of  the  research  and
specimen  collection.  IRB  guidelines  require  that  research  protocols
specify the disposition of remaining specimens after the completion
of the research. The principal investigator must request permission
from  the  participants  via  informed  consent  to  store  the  remaining
specimens for future use.

In closing, CDC reference collections are a core component of our
mission,  unique  in  the  world  and  absolutely  critical  to  research  in
medicine and public health. Storage and subsequent disposal of the
specimens  are  carefully  managed.  These  specimens  provide  the
agency  with  the  ability  to  not  only  detect,  respond  to  and  control
diseases  today  but  are  vital  to  unraveling  tomorrow’s  unexpected
disease crises.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Sub-
committee to share this information with you about our invaluable

Each  year,  CDC  laboratories  receive  hundreds  of  thousands  of  human  and  envi-
ronmental  specimens  from  its  various  partners  in  public  health  throughout  the
United  States  and  abroad.  Many  of  these  specimens  contain  organisms  or  products
that  other  laboratories  could  not  identify,  and  virtually  all  of  these  specimens  are
automatically  archived  because  of  their  potential  importance  to  public  health  and
safety.  These  specimens  are  collected  for  the  purpose  of  detecting,  controlling,  and
preventing morbidity and mortality from diseases. Specimens are used for a variety
of  purposes, 
including  research,  pathogen  discovery,  diagnostics,  reference
diagnostics, vaccine development, and supporting external scientific research activi-
ties within multiple National Centers across CDC.

Upon  receipt,  CDC  logs,  tracks,  and  examines  these  specimens  and  provides  re-
ports  of  any  laboratory  tests  to  the  submitter  of  the  specimen  or  other  appropriate
authorities. Specimen logging, tracking, and reporting is managed by our automated
Specimen  Tracking  and  Retrieval  Laboratory  Information  Management  Systems
(STARLiMs). Any given specimens or samples we receive may be entirely consumed
by the testing process, or portions may be stored for safekeeping or retained for fu-
ture  use.  In  extremely  rare  circumstances,  some  of  our  archived  specimens  may  be
destroyed  because  of  space  limitations,  lack  of  current  relevance,  loss  of  viability
during  storage,  lack  of  appropriate  documentation,  or  when  required  by  an  Institu-
tional Review Board (IRB).

Maintaining  CDC’s  world  renowned  culture  collections  of  specimens  is  essential
to carrying out the agency’s core public health functions to detect, control, and pre-
vent  morbidity  and  mortality  from  infectious  diseases.  CDC  manages  its  specimens
in a manner commensurate with the scientific integrity required by HHS guidelines
and  policies.  These  policies  and  guidelines  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  HHS
Public  Health  Service  Policies  on  Research  Misconduct  (42  CFR  Part  93)1 and  the
HHS Protection of Human Subjects regulations (45 CFR Part 46). Laboratories also
have guidelines specific to the types of specimens collected, as most collections must
be  handled  in  very  specific  and  often  unique  ways,  for  example,  CDC’s  ‘‘West  Nile
Virus:  Guide  for  Clinicians,’’  and  CDC’s  ‘‘Instructions  for  Testing  by  the  Division  of
Vector-Borne  Infectious  Diseases  Bacterial  Zoonoses  Diagnostic  Laboratory.’’ 2 Each

1 Some of the areas covered in this policy include: ‘‘Protection of the confidentiality of respond-
ents,  complainants,  and  research  subjects  identifiable  from  research  records  or  evidence,  con-
sistent with’’ 42 CFR 93.108; and, ‘‘A thorough, competent, objective, and fair response to allega-
tions of research misconduct consistent with, and within the time limits of the final rule, includ-
ing precautions to ensure that individuals responsible for carrying out any part of the research
misconduct proceeding do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of in-
terest  with  the  complainant,  respondent,  or  witnesses,’’  as  explained  at  http://ori.hhs.gov/poli-
cies/Requirements-Reg-6-05.shtml

collection has a curator, whose responsibility is to create, maintain, and oversee the
use  of  these  special  collections.  These  specimen  collections  are  unique  and  un-
matched anywhere in the world. They are critical to CDC’s mission and to our com-
mitment  to  the  global  community  as  a  reference  diagnostic  center,  as  well  as  sup-
porting  the  work  accomplished  in  our  nearly  30  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)
Collaborating  Centers  for  Reference  and  Research  on  viruses,  bacteria,  parasites,
and fungi.

Rare  and  irreplaceable  collections  of  specimens  stored  at  CDC  are  subject  to  the
limitations of research resources that could block our ability to uncover the benefits
to  health  and  medicine  that  are  contained  in  these  specimens,  some  representing
historical  collections  pre-1945  (pre-antibiotic  era).  For  example,  CDC  routinely  per-
forms reference and research activities on rare, unusual, and novel bacterial patho-
gens.  This  work  requires  comparison  of  the  new,  unknown  organism  to  isolates  of
archived  strains  with  similar  characteristics.  New  pathogens  are  discovered  when
novel isolates are shown to be unrelated to any archived organism or DNA sequence
on record. We would be unable to conduct our comprehensive work on pathogen dis-
covery without these valuable strain collections.

The  CDC’s  diagnostic  laboratories  save  and  store  the  significant  organisms  they
identify;  the  laboratories  are  certified  under  the  standards  of  the  Clinical  Labora-
tory  Improvement  Amendments  (CLIA)  of  1988  and  currently  have  policy  state-
ments and guidelines regarding archival and storage of laboratory specimens. Under
CDC’s Laboratory Quality Management System (QMS) approach to carrying out our
laboratory science, all laboratories are required to document their policies and proc-
esses for specimen collection, disposal, and storage. The QMS is part of CDC’s ongo-
ing  work  to  achieve  even  higher  quality  standards  and  is  aimed  at  standardization
of policies to the extent that is possible, given the distinct nature of each laboratory.
CDC  also  is  a  participating  member  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Coun-
cil’s  Interagency  Working  Group  on  Scientific  Collections.  CDC’s  specimen  archival
storage  facilities  and  containers  consist  of  -70°C  freezers  and  liquid  nitrogen  con-
tainers  that  are  monitored  twenty-four  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week,  with  up  to
three contacts available and listed on each storage container, should an alarm indi-
cate  a  problem  with  temperature  control  that  could  threaten  the  contents.  To  fur-
ther protect our collections, CDC and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
have an oral agreement that new and reclassified strains of enteric bacterial patho-
gens  are  placed  into  the  ATCC  collection  so  that  the  organisms  are  available  from
the ATCC to all scientists for purchase to use in their research.

Specimens  at  CDC  that  were  collected  for  the  purposes  of  human  subjects  re-
search  must  comply  with  the  HHS  Protection  of  Human  Subjects  regulations  (45
CFR Part 46). This includes specimens collected for research conducted by CDC em-
ployees or supported by CDC through funding or provision of other tangible support
whether  conducted  inside  or  outside  the  United  States.  CDC  investigators  who  col-
lect  and  use  these  specimens  are  trained  in  compliance  with  the  regulations  that
apply to investigators who engage in research using human subjects. Unless exempt,
under the HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects, all research involv-
ing  human  subjects  must  be  approved  by  an  IRB  prior  to  the  start  of  the  research
and specimen collection. CDC IRBs are composed of members from various scientific
disciplines  including  health  fields,  social  sciences,  methodology,  laboratory  sciences
and  toxicology;  and  non-scientific  disciplines,  including  ethics,  education,  adminis-
tration and youth advocacy. Most IRB panels have members with specialized knowl-
edge  of  the  interests  of  pregnant  women,  children,  prisoners,  and  other  categories
of  vulnerable  groups  and  individuals,  to  protect  them  from  inappropriate  or  uneth-
ical  treatment.  Each  of  CDC’s  seven  IRBs  is  composed  of  12  to  16  members,  and
at  least  one  to  three  of  these  members  are  not  affiliated  with  CDC.  The  guidelines
of  the  CDC  IRBs  require  that  protocols  specify  the  disposition  of  remaining  speci-
mens  after  completion  of  the  research,  and  the  principal  investigator  must  request
permission from the participants via informed consent to store the remaining speci-
mens  for  future  use,  unless  that  requirement  is  waived  by  the  IRB  or  the  samples
have been stripped of identifiers. These are common industry best practices.

How  CDC  laboratories  evaluate  the  continuing  need  for,  and  scientific

value of, the collections of specimens in its laboratories:

CDC  reference  collections  are  a  core  component  of  our  mission,  unique  in  the
world,  and  absolutely  critical  to  research  in  medicine  and  public  health.  When  as-
sessing  archival  specimens,  we  take  into  consideration  a  number  of  factors,  includ-
ing the needs of special patient populations (such as HIV-positive individuals, inten-
sive  care  unit  patients,  ethnic  populations,  and  women);  novel  or  emerging  agents
of  disease  compared  to  archival  isolates;  pathogen  discovery;  pre-antibiotic  era  iso-
lates (pre-1945); epidemics or pandemics; confirmation or development of taxonomic

additions  or  changes;  and  correlation  of  new  isolates  to  disease.  CDC  evaluates  the
value  of  particular  collections  based  on  the  uniqueness  of  the  isolate,  its  potential
value  in  future  studies,  and  especially  the  quality  of  supporting  data  that  accom-
panies  the  collection.  Additionally,  the  number  of  external  requests  for  archived
samples  is  another  indicator  for  the  need  of  our  collections.  These  materials  are
readily  available  to  requestors  through  Material  Transfer  Agreements  (MTAs)  that
outline  roles  and  responsibilities  of  both  the  provider  and  recipient.  Last  year,  for
example,  CDC  executed  approximately  200  MTAs  for  materials  in  our  collections.
Collections are only as good as the clinical and epidemiological information avail-
able for the specimens. Clinical data can identify specimens from persons with well-
defined diseases, or persons well-defined as ‘‘healthy’’ individuals. Some rare collec-
tions  may  represent  historical  importance  documenting  the  first  introduction  of  a
disease caused by a particular strain. For example, our virus collections were critical
when  CDC  responded  to  the  world-wide  outbreak  of  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syn-
drome (SARS) in 2003. Other collections allowed CDC to recognize the agent of Le-
gionnaires’ disease in 1977 as a newly defined organism and to trace its origins. Di-
agnostic  tests  and  laboratory  identification  procedures  developed  by  CDC  are  vali-
dated  using  dozens  of  archived  isolates  as  well  as  specimens  from  both  normal  do-
nors and donors that are identified with specific diseases, such as influenza and res-
piratory syncytial virus.

Currently  most  of  our  laboratories  have  no  uniform  protocols  in  place  regarding
the destruction of specimen archives. When necessary, destruction occurs only after
study  and  consultation  and  in  a  very  controlled  and  documented  manner.  Indeed,
we never want to purposely dispose of rare collections, and it is uncommon that any
are destroyed.

The  establishment  of  the  CDC  and  Agency  for  Toxic  Substances  and  Dis-
ease Registry (ATSDR) Specimen Packaging, Inventory and Repos-
itory (CASPIR) and its contribution to specimen resource manage-
ment at the CDC.

In  the  early  1990’s,  CDC/ATSDR  developed  a  specimen  repository  that  provides
for  secure,  long-term  storage  and  management  of  our  valuable  collections  of  speci-
mens.  The  CDC/ATSDR  Specimen  Packaging,  Inventory  and  Repository  (CASPIR)
is a significant resource for the management of specimen collections at CDC because
it provides archival space not available on the main CDC campus and utilizes a doc-
umented management system for these archives.

The roles of CASPIR are to: 1) ensure each collection has a scientific curator who
is responsible for the information in the collection and who approves the use of the
collection  by  persons  or  groups  outside  of  the  scientific  program  that  collected  the
specimens;  2)  ensure  the  quality  of  the  specimens  in  storage  by  monitoring  freezer
temperatures  and  responding  to  alarms  caused  by  temperature  changes;  3)  provide
a  single  electronic  database  for  the  inventory;  4)  provide  a  secure  location  for  the
specimens;  5)  ensure  that  when  investigators  leave  CDC,  the  collection  is  assigned
to another CDC investigator; and 6) facilitate sharing of specimens, associated clin-
ical  and  epidemiological  data,  and  test  results.  CASPIR  places  critical  record  keep-
ing in the hands of archivists, not busy laboratorians, and thus ensures availability
of unique isolates to national and international research

Policies  and  procedures  were  developed  through  a  CASPIR  Policy  Board.  These
policies  include:  apportionment  of  available  storage  space;  admitting  specimen  col-
lections; cataloging collections; ensuring confidentiality; ensuring data quality; docu-
menting  data  and  specimen  sharing;  ensuring  data  security;  specimen  and  data
withdrawal and use; additional testing of specimens; human subjects review issues;
review  of  specimen  usage  and  disposal  of  unwanted  specimens;  physical  security  of
specimens; and contingency and disaster management. Storage space is allocated to
a  CDC  program  based  on  requests  from  each  program,  and  space  is  reapportioned
when necessary.

Collections  for  research  are  admitted  to  CASPIR  when  they  meet  basic  criteria
and  have  the  appropriate  approvals  from  CDC’s  National  Center  directors  or  their
designees. The mandatory criteria for acceptance include submission of the following
information:  study  design;  study  sites;  duration  of  the  study;  study  population;  and
a  copy  of  the  informed  consent  form  for  the  overall  study.  Additional  information
needed  includes  whether  epidemiological  or  clinical  data  were  collected;  types  and
number of specimens collected; types of tests performed directly on the study partici-
pants or the specimens; and contact information for the custodians of the collection.
Lastly, each collection must be unique and not redundant of other collection already
stored.  Individual  isolates  will  be  stored  in  CASPIR  only  if  they  are  deemed  to  be
unique and cannot be easily recreated.

In addition to this information about the study, there are additional explicit man-
datory  criteria  about  the  samples  themselves  for  specimens  to  be  deposited  to
CASPIR. The specimens must be sera, plasma lymphocytes, other body fluids, sepa-
rated white blood cells, nucleic acids, cultures of microorganisms, or other miscella-
neous  biologicals.  They  must  be  of  a  certain  volume,  age,  and  condition,  to  ensure
that  meaningful  testing  can  be  performed  on  the  specimen  if  retrieved  at  a  later
date. There also must be sufficient volume of remaining specimen to be of value for
testing.  When  appropriate,  the  method  of  specimen  collection  that  was  used  is  in-
cluded. An important example of this information would be the type of anticoagulant
in which the specimen was collected. Sterility and viability must be documented. Fi-
nally, the specimens must be in storage vessels appropriate for the proposed storage
condition.  For  example,  the  use  of  glass  vials  is  not  appropriate  unless  storage  is
in a refrigerator.

Detailed  information  about  the  collection  is  necessary  for  the  specimens  to  be
meaningful. This information includes: the name and contact information of the cus-
todian and designated organizational contact if there is a recommendation to discard
the collection; a brief description of the project and study design and why the activ-
ity led to the collection; information about the source of the specimens; the age and
time period of the collection; the geographical location or locations where the speci-
mens  were  obtained;  the  study  population  (e.g.,  uranium  workers  in  New  Mexico);
demographic  data  such  as  age,  gender,  race,  and  ethnicity;  whether  the  collection
was  the  result  of  a  research  project  and  the  consent  form  used,  if  available;  types
of  tests  performed  directly  on  the  study  participants  or  the  specimens;  and,  types,
number, and volume of specimens in the collection.

Acceptance  of  collections  requires  completing  a  form  with  all  the  information
noted  above  and  with  written  approvals  from  the  appropriate  CDC  officials.  Exter-
nally-obtained  collections  are  not  accepted  into  CASPIR  unless  a  National  Center
shares ownership of the collection and can assist in technical and scientific decisions
regarding the use of the collection.

Distribution of specimens from the collection takes into consideration that though
the  investigators  are  custodians  of  the  collection,  CDC  is  the  ultimate  owner.  This
policy  helps  to  assure  that  the  investment  made  by  CDC  to  conduct  critical  studies
and  analyze  valuable  specimens  will  be  securely  maintained.  When  collections  are
accepted into the CASPIR facility, a determination is made as to the availability of
the collection for use by those outside of the scientific program that is the custodian.
Each  National  Center  must  then  establish  a  review  process  for  requests  of  mate-
rials,  including  a  process  for  assuring  that  IRB  approval  is  obtained  before  human
specimens  will  be  provided  for  non-exempt  human  subjects  research.  Release  of
specimens and associated data must be approved by the National Center. There are
provisions for appeals of denials of approvals.

All  specimen  and  data  bank  information  is  treated  in  a  confidential  manner  and
safeguarded in accordance with the Privacy Act and any other applicable laws, regu-
lations, and policies.

National Centers are required to review the usage of their collections annually to
ensure  the  periodic  disposal  or  transfer  of  materials  that  they  determine  are  no
longer  used  or  needed.  Before  disposal  or  transfer,  the  appropriate  CDC  program
officials  must  provide  descriptions  of  the  excess  specimen  collections  to  other  Na-
tional  Centers,  institutions,  or  organizations  affiliated  with  the  collection  through
the  Associate  Director  for  Science  at  CDC.  Any  disposal  or  transfer  of  specimens
that  can  be  directly  linked  back  to  the  study  subject  must  be  consistent  with  what
was stated in the consent form. When appropriate approvals are given, the recipient
organization  becomes  the  custodian  of  the  collection  and  assumes  responsibility  for
it. Any destruction of specimens must follow current biosafety guidelines established
by CDC and the National Institutes of Health.

Conclusion

In closing, CDC reference collections are a core component of our mission, unique
in the world, and absolutely critical to research in medicine and public health. CDC
takes  its  use  of  and  subsequent  storage  and  disposal  of  specimens  seriously.  These
specimens  provide  the  agency  with  the  ability  to  not  only  detect,  respond  to,  and
control diseases today but are vital to unraveling tomorrow’s unexpected disease cri-
ses.

Thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  appear  before  the  Subcommittee  to  share  this  in-
formation with you about our invaluable specimen archives. I would be happy to an-
swer any questions.

DISCUSSION

SCIENTIFIC COLLECTION DISPOSAL AT NCI AND CDC

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  Both  of  you  gave  testimony  that
was reassuring that our agencies, the procedures for the disposition
of scientific collections are done with some care and some thought-
fulness,  some  thought.  Can  you  assure  the  Subcommittee  that  a
similar  incident  would  not  have  occurred  at  your  institution?  Dr.
Vaught?

Dr.  VAUGHT.  Well,  the  NCI  and  the  broader  NIH  have  spent  a
lot  of  time  in  the  past  few  years  trying  to  put  policies  into  place
to  anticipate  and  manage  collections  so  that  they  are  collected,
processed  and  stored  in  an  orderly  way,  and  I  believe  the  policy
that has been most effective in this has been established within the
last two years by the NIH and its intramural program that I men-
tioned  where  IRB  packages  and  institutional  review  board  pack-
ages have to have a custodianship plan included for specimens and
data.  When  an  investigator  leaves  NIH  or  otherwise  something
changes  that  causes  the  custodianship  of  the  sample  collection  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:01 Dec 27, 2008 Jkt 043530 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6621 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\090908\43530C SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

357

change,  then  that  has  to  be  done  in  an  orderly  way.  If  the  person
goes outside NIH, then there are material transfer agreements that
control  transferring  specimens  and  data  outside  of  NIH,  and  if
some  change  occurs  within  NIH,  then  there  is  agreement  among
various  investigators  to  change  the  principal  investigator  who  will
lead  and  control  the  specimen  collection.  So  we  believe  we  have
those issues covered in that way.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Nicholson, would the CDC have destroyed
a  collection  in  the  circumstances  that  you  have  heard  occurred
here?

Dr.  NICHOLSON.  CDC  has  a  similar  approach  to  NIH  in  this  re-
gard.  Quite  honestly,  the  investigators  at  CDC  have  a  very  hard
time  removing  any  specimens  from  the  collection  and  it  is  a  very
difficult decision when that would happen.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Vaught,  your  testimony  is  that  we  need
long-term plans for custodianship, really very standardized and ex-
cellent management practices, many of the collections really are ir-
replaceable  and  priceless,  and  that  other  agencies  need  systems  in
place,  procedures  in  place,  protocols  in  place  like  what  NCI  has.
Would  a  Congressional  directive  to  establish  such  policies  and  im-
plement  the  policies  throughout  the  various  federal  agencies  that
do such research help that goal?

Dr.  VAUGHT.  Well,  I  think  there  is  no  easy  answer  to  that.  I
think the basic principles that I laid out that NCI and NIH use are
very  good  ones  for  custodianship  of  specimen  collections.  I  believe,
Mr.  Chairman,  you  touched  in  your  earlier  opening  statement  on
the  interagency  issues,  that  the  OSTP  created  this  Interagency
Working  Group  on  Scientific  Collections  and  we  found  in  that
group that I think it is something like only 35 or 40 percent of the
agencies  that  reported  have  standard  operating  procedures  and
policies  for  managing  long-term  management  of  their  collections.
But  we  have  to  remember  that  scientific  collections  include  not
only the biological specimens that I mentioned for NIH but also in
my  written  testimony  I  mentioned  that  the  moon  rock  collections
that  NASA  manages,  for  example,  the  Smithsonian  artifacts  from
the Lewis and Clark expedition have to be managed and these are
all  important  collections  for  different  reasons  so  they  would  have
differing  management  policies,  depending  on  the  type  of  collection
that  is  involved.  So  I  think  it  would  be  difficult  to  write  a  policy
that covers all the bases there but I think it is probably something
to be followed up with by this interagency working group.

Chairman MILLER. But biospecimens in particular, biobanking in
particular, it does seem that they are somewhat different from the
artifacts of the Lewis and Clerk expedition. Would a directive from
Congress to adopt a standard set of policies help make sure—which
obviously has not happened. Would it help that happen?

Dr.  VAUGHT.  Well,  I  think  we  have  to  remember  that  there  are
already policies and regulations in place including the federal regu-
lations  that  govern  informed  consent  from  the  Department  of
Health  and  Human  Services  and  also  the  regulations  and  rules
within NIH and other agencies that govern material transfer agree-
ments, so you already have a basis for creating custodianship poli-
cies.  So  the  question  I  think  would  be  whether  you  go  beyond  the
existing  IRB  and  informed  consent  rules  and  regulations  and  the

existing  material  transfer  agreement  regulations  and  create  some-
thing  that  is  beyond  that.  I  think  there  are  already  good  policies
in place to handle most of these kinds of situations.

Chairman MILLER. Are you aware of such policies at the VA?
Dr. VAUGHT. Actually I don’t know—I know very little about the
VA’s policies. The informed consent policies that Dr. Nicholson and
I  operate  under  are  governed  by  what  is  called  the  Common  Rule,
and that is a HHS regulation.

Chairman MILLER. My time is expired. Mr. Rohrabacher.

SHOULD THE SPL BEEN AT THE VA?

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I take it that both of you knew that the major area that we were
supposed  to  be  looking  at  here  today,  the  reason  you  are  here,  is
to give us a broader image, a broader view as well, which you have
and  I  appreciate  that,  but  I  would  like  to  ask  your  opinion  on  this
case.  I  believe  that  first  of  all  the  research  that  was  being  con-
ducted  which  we  now  know  contributed  greatly  to  saving  human
life and is very admirable and positive research for the country and
for the well-being of our people, should that research have been VA
research or should it have been under NIH or CDC?

Dr.  NICHOLSON.  CDC  does  have  a  Legionella  lab  that  does  re-
search. I don’t know enough about what the VA’s mission is to de-
termine  whether  or  not  CDC  should  also  do  that  type  of  research.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. So the CDC could well have offered an alter-

native to encompassing this research and bringing them in?

Dr.  NICHOLSON.  I  am  not  the  Legionella  expert  so  I  don’t  know
what  the  focus  of  the  research  in  our  Legionella  lab  is  so  I  can’t
really say.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right. What about with NIH?
Dr. VAUGHT. Well, I think I am even further removed from that.
NIH has something like 26 or 27 institutes. One of them is the Na-
tional  Institute  of  Allergic  and  Infectious  Diseases,  NIAID,  and
NIAID works closely with the CDC on infectious disease issues, but
I  couldn’t  say  whether  this  would  fall  under  NIAID’s  mission  or
not.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Were  the  people  involved  and  was  the  lab
that  is  now  being  looked  at—you  have  listened  to  the  testimony
and  I  don’t  know  if  you  read  the  testimony  to  come  or  not  but  is
it your professional opinions that the job that they were doing met
your professional standards?

Dr.  VAUGHT.  I  honestly  don’t  know  enough  about  this  situation
to  comment  on  that.  I  have  of  course  read  some  of  the  testimony
and background papers and so forth but really my major conclusion
was  that  this  was  an  issue  of  custodianship  and  so  I  have  tried  to
address that from NCI and NIH’s point of view and hopefully those
sorts  of  policies  and  procedures  that  we  developed  at  NIH  would
be applied in other situations but I really——

MORE ON SCIENTIFIC COLLECTION DISPOSAL AT NCI AND

CDC

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  We  are  talking  about  custodianship  in  a  pe-
riod  of  transition  as  well.  They  were  closing  the  lab  and  who  then

and what those procedures should be and how to make sure situa-
tions  don’t  arise  like  this  in  which  some  very  damaging  decisions
were  made  that  ended  up  with  the  destruction  of  materials  that
could well have served us and served the lives of human beings in
a very important way, and what would you say to that?

Dr. NICHOLSON. I don’t really have any more to add. I also don’t
know  any  more  than  we  just  heard  this  morning  about  this  par-
ticular case.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And have any of your organizations had run-

ins with the administration like this before?

Dr. VAUGHT. Run-ins with our administration?
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  With  people  who  are  overseeing  you  within
the  administration  for  budgetary  reasons  making  decisions  that
could lead to a negative impact.

Dr.  VAUGHT.  Well,  I  can  only  say  from  my  own  experience  that
there are policies and procedures developed at NIH for closing labs
and  an  orderly  transfer  of  equipment,  materials  and  personnel.
Those decisions are made above my pay grade but they happen.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. So there are decisions that you think that are
in  place  at  NIH  that  would  have  prevented  this  destruction  of
these specimens?

Dr.  VAUGHT.  I  can  only  say  that  I  believe  that  we  have  orderly

processes in place at NIH.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. What about the CDC in this?
Dr.  NICHOLSON.  For  the  long-term  collections,  yes,  that  is  abso-
lutely  the  case.  There  are  policies  and  procedures  in  place  to  en-
sure  that  appropriate  approvals  are  received  in  order  to  destroy
specimens.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  I  won’t  try  to  put  you  on  the  spot  any-
more because I understand the position you are in, but let us just—
again,  I  realize,  like  I  stated  in  the  beginning,  there  are  bad  deci-
sions  that  are  made  by  people  that  should  be  held  accountable.
There  are  also  bureaucratic  problems  that  arise  within  a  govern-
mental  approach  to  problems  and  governmental  involvement  in
human  activity.  So  we  will  find  out  what  is  at  the  bottom  of  this
but certainly these are people that have contributed enormously to
the  well-being  of  our  people.  I  mean,  Legionnaires’  disease,  it  is  a
very  admirable  thing  to  come  up  with  some  solution  for  that  and
some way they can be treated. We end up with a situation like this
and I am very pleased that the Chairman to focus his attention on
this issue. Thank you very much.

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Rohrabacher.
Dr. Broun.
Mr.  BROUN.  Thank  you  all  for  coming  to  this  hearing  today.  As
a  physician  and  scientist,  I  am  very  concerned  about  this  issue.  I
just  have  a  question  of  each  of  you.  Do  you  see  any  reason,  any
compelling  reason  from  a  scientific  perspective  why  these  speci-
mens  should  have  been  destroyed  in  the  way  that  they  were,  from
a safety perspective, a health perspective or anything else? Can you
see  any  reason  to  just  destroy  these  specimens  the  way  that  they
were  handled?  And  I  would  like  both  of  you  to  comment  on  that,
please.

Dr.  VAUGHT.  Well,  again,  I  feel  like  as  a  scientist  that  I  really
don’t know all the facts in this case to make that sort of judgment.

I  can  tell  you  that  in  our  experience  at  NIH,  there  are  a  number
of reasons that specimen collections would be destroyed after a long
and careful process of reviewing their utility. Normally they would
be destroyed if they are no longer useful for their original purpose,
or  if  there  isn’t  enough  sample  left  to  do  any  further  work  on.  Or
if  they  presented  some  other  sort  of  biohazard  may  be  one  reason
but usually those biohazard issues can be mitigated by regulations
that  are  in  place  at  NIH  and  CDC.  So  I  just  have  to  say  that  a
lot  of  thought  is  given  to  destroying  specimen  collections,  and  as
Dr.  Nicholson  stated,  usually  the  problem  is  getting  investigators
to let go of their specimens because the tendency is to want to save
them as long as possible and that is why we have huge warehouses
full of freezers out in Frederick, Maryland.

Mr. BROUN. Dr. Nicholson.
Dr.  NICHOLSON.  I  also  don’t  know  enough  about  this  particular
case. I will tell you, I don’t have a whole lot more to add over what
Dr.  Vaught  has  said,  but  within  CDC  it  would  be  very  rare  for  a
specimen collection to be destroyed. I am not aware of any of that.
It  is  not  all  that  unusual  for  specimens  as  part  of  collections  to  be
destroyed because of a variety of reasons that you may understand
and that I had already outlined.

Mr. BROUN. Certainly as a practicing physician, I don’t anticipate
my  own  patients’  specimens  to  be  continued  on  an  ongoing  basis
once  I  get  the  clinical  information  I  need  as  a  practicing  doctor.  I
make  those  clinical  decisions  that  I  make  and  then  I  don’t  expect
those decisions, but also valuable research is absolutely critical for
antibody  development  and  to  find  out  about  pathogens  changing
their  response  to  various  anti-microbials,  et  cetera,  and  so  I  just—
I  can’t  imagine  as  a  scientist  just  destroying  a  whole  set  of  speci-
mens  just  without  any  regard,  particularly  those  that  are  involved
in patient care and patient evaluation prior to having a determina-
tion  about  what  the  final  results  of  that  culture  might  be.  In  each
of  y’all’s  opinion,  is  destroying  a  specimen  prior  to  developing  the
identification  and  antibiotic  sensitivities  to  clinical  specimens—to
me,  this  seems  to  be  just  totally  beyond  comprehension.  Can  you
see any compelling reason to destroy those when you have an ongo-
ing  process  for  clinical  specimens  on  patients  or  environmental
sources  of  those  specimens  prior  to  the  determination  of  what  the
pathogen—well, whether this is pathogen there, what the pathogen
might  be  and  anything  to  help  in  determining  how  to  deal  with
that pathogen at that point?

Dr.  NICHOLSON.  For  clinical  laboratories,  and  CDC  does  do  ref-
erence diagnostic testing, primarily for the State public health lab-
oratories, we have to abide by CLIA and every CLIA laboratory has
written  procedures  and  protocols  about  the  collection  and  the  use
and  the  storage  of  such  specimens.  Specimens  before  they  actually
have  been  evaluated  to  determine  what  might  be  the  causative
agent may be actually rejected because they appear to CDC in such
poor  condition,  they  were  exposed  to  high  temperatures.  There  are
other  physical  reasons  for  specimens  to  have  never  reached  the
testing component after they have been collected.

Mr.  BROUN.  But  at  this  point,  again,  just  for  the  record,  when
that determination is made, it is because of inadequacy of collection

materials  or  that  the  media  has  a  problem  with  it  or  something
else.

Dr. NICHOLSON. Exactly.
Mr.  BROUN.  It  is  not  because  it  is  a  valid  specimen  that  could

be utilized in that investigation. Is that correct?

Dr. NICHOLSON. Exactly.
Mr. BROUN. Dr. Vaught, do you have anything to add?
Dr. VAUGHT. I don’t think so. My experience at the Cancer Insti-
tute  is  not  in  infectious  disease  so  our  specimens  are  collected,  for
example,  for  clinical  trials  and  epidemiology  studies  where  cancer
biomarkers  are  studied,  and  usually—or  always,  there  is  a  study
protocol where it is determined what the specimens are going to be
used  for,  how  long  they  are  going  to  be  saved,  and  there  are  pri-
mary  hypotheses,  secondary  hypotheses.  When  all  of  those
hypotheses are exhausted, then consideration will be given usually
to  sharing  any  additional  specimens  that  are  left  over  with  inves-
tigators  outside  of  NIH  or  colleagues  within  NIH.  So  discarding  a
sample collection is usually the last resort when it is no longer use-
ful  or  there  could  be  some  circumstances  where  specimens  are  no
longer useful or they are not in good condition to be used but those
would be, as I said, as a last resort.

Mr. BROUN. Thank you very much.
Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Dr. Broun.
I  think  we  have  no  further  questions  of  this  panel.  Thank  you
very much for being here, and we will now take about a 15-minute
break before the final panel. Thank you.

Chairman  MILLER.  We  will  wait  just  a  minute  or  two  for  Mr.

Rohrabacher.

Panel III:

Chairman MILLER. We are back.
I would now like to introduce our final panel today. Mr. Michael
Moreland  is  the  Director  of  the  Veterans  Integrated  Service  Net-
work  4  at  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs.  Dr.  Mona  Melhem
is  the  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  and  Vice  President  of  the  Clinical
Support  Service  Line 
for  the  Veterans  Affairs,  Pittsburgh
Healthcare System. Dr. Ali Sonel is the Associate Chief of Staff for
the  Veterans  Affairs  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System.  Dr.  Steven
Graham  is  the  Director  of  the  Geriatric  Research,  Education,  and
Clinical  Centers  at  the  Veterans  Affairs,  Pittsburgh  Healthcare
System.  And  Ms.  Cheryl  Wanzie  is  the  Chief  Technologist  for  the
Veterans  Affairs  Pittsburgh  System.  Dr.  Sonel  is  the  Associate
Chief  of  Staff  for  Research,  specifically,  at  the  Veterans  Affairs,
Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System.  I  understand  that  only  Mr.
Moreland  will  be  giving  prepared  testimony  today,  but  the  other
witnesses will answer questions that may be directed to them.

Mr. SONEL. Actually, sir, each of the witnesses does have an oral

Chairman MILLER. Oh, all right. We will take the oral statement.
We did not get anything in writing beforehand but that is fine. As
you know, from seeing the earlier two panels, we do take testimony

under  oath.  Do  any  of  you  have  an  objection  to  being  sworn  in,  to
swearing  an  oath?  All  the  witnesses  nodded  their  head  that  they
had  no  problem,  no  objection.  The  Committee  also  provides  that
you  may  be  represented  by  counsel.  Do  any  of  you  have  counsel
with  you  at  the  hearing  today?  All  witnesses  nodded  or  said  that
they  did  not  have  counsel.  Now,  please  stand  and  raise  your  right
hand.  Do  you  swear  to  tell  the  truth  and  nothing  but  the  truth?
All  the  witnesses  said  or  otherwise—all  the  witnesses  are  now  so
sworn.

Mr. Moreland, you may begin.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MICHAEL  E.  MORELAND,  NETWORK  DI-
RECTOR,  VA  HEALTHCARE—VISN  4,  DEPARTMENT  OF  VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS
Mr.  MORELAND.  Thank  you.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  and
Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
discuss the events surrounding the closure of the Special Pathogens
Laboratory  at  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  Center.  I  am  joined
today  by  several  colleagues  from  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare
System  including  Dr.  Ali  Sonel,  our  Associate  Chief  of  Research
and  Development,  Dr.  Mona  Melhem,  our  Vice  President,  Clinical
Support  Service  line,  Ms.  Cheryl  Wanzie,  Medical  Technologist,
and Dr. Steve Graham, Director, Geriatric Research and Education
Center.  And  sir,  I  assume  our  written  testimonies  will  all  be  en-
tered for the record.

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Moreland,  I  believe  that  only  you  have
submitted  written  testimony.  It  will  be  submitted  in  full  in  the
record.

Mr. MORELAND. Thank you very much. Today we will address the
closure  of  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab,  the  disposition  of  equipment
and  specimens,  and  the  VA  policies  as  they  were  in  December  of
2006. Additionally, I will discuss some changes that we have made
and instituted in policy since that time.

In January of 2006, the Associate Chief of Staff for Clinical Sup-
port who oversees all of Pittsburgh’s laboratory functions conducted
a standard review of the Special Pathogens Lab workload. This re-
view  determined  that  the  main  clinical  laboratory  would  be  more
efficiently  managing  these  duties.  It  also  revealed  that  the  Special
Pathogens  Lab  was  acting  beyond  its  intended  scope.  The  lab
lacked a defined and approved research activity and the volume of
clinical  work  being  performed  was  low.  These  plus  other  concerns
led us to conclude that the Special Pathogens Lab would be moved
into  the  main  clinical  lab  and  that  additional  reviews  of  the  lab’s
research accounts would be unnecessary.

The  Special  Pathogens  Lab  closed  on  July  21,  2006.  Approxi-
mately  two  weeks  earlier,  on  July  the  5th,  the  Director  of  the  lab
was  notified  by  e-mail  and  in  person  about  the  lab’s  closure,  and
he  and  his  staff  were  given  two  weeks  to  complete  work  currently
in process. This notification included instructions to stop accepting
specimens  from  external  customers.  The  lab’s  close-out  plans  were
forwarded  to  the  lab’s  staff  on  July  the  7th,  and  formal  letters  of
notification  were  delivered  on  July  the  10th.  The  members  of  the
lab  received  clear  direction  regarding  labeling  of  existing  and  new
specimens  and  stored  samples,  and  the  members  of  the  lab  were

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:01 Dec 27, 2008 Jkt 043530 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 6621 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\090908\43530C SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

363

told  to  provide  a  map  for  this  storage.  These  orders  were  specific,
but they were ignored.

As  the  Medical  Center  Director,  I  initiated  an  Administrative
Board  of  Investigation  to  review  research  and  financial  activities.
The  Administrative  Board  determined  that  the  lab  was  operating
outside of its established scope of services and had involved into an
unauthorized  commercial  enterprise,  testing  samples  for  private
companies  including  hotels,  restaurants,  and  gas  stations.  It  was
also  engaged  in  subcontracting  for  private  environmental  compa-
nies.  The  lab  had  a  commercial  client  list  well  into  the  hundreds.
In September of 2006, we conducted a review of every publication
generated  in  the  lab  and  concluded  its  studies  involving  human
subjects  were  conducted  without  required  approval  from  the  Insti-
tutional Review Board and/or the Research and Development Com-
mittee.  To  our  knowledge,  no  individuals  were  harmed  as  a  result
of this research. We reported these findings to the VA Office of Re-
search Oversight, ORO, in October of 2006. They concluded we had
adequately  addressed  research  non-compliance  by  preventing  the
lab  from  any  future  research  projects,  eventually  closing  the  lab,
and  establishing  safeguards  to  prevent  similar  non-compliance  in
the future. Following the lab’s closure, all properly labeled and cat-
aloged  clinical  specimens  were  moved  to  the  main  lab.  Research
specimens  associated  with  an  approved  research  protocol  properly
labeled  and  maintained  by  the  principal  investigator  were  trans-
ferred  to  the  main  clinical  lab  for  storage  as  well.  In  these  speci-
mens  that  were  either  not  labeled  or  not  cataloged  or  properly
sealed  were  considered  biohazardous  material  and  were  safely  dis-
posed of in accordance with hazardous material procedures to safe-
guard patient care and public health. VA Pittsburgh water samples
were transferred to the clinical laboratory and were sent to an out-
side  vendor  for  Legionella  testing  subsequent  to  the  lab’s  closure.
VHA policy in December of 2006 clearly stated that if an investi-
gator  leaves  the  VA  facility,  the  original  research  records  must  be
retained  at  the  institution.  Moreover,  VA  policy  instructs  that
records  and  information  collected  and  created  by  VA  personnel,  in
the  conduct  of  official  business,  belong  to  the  Federal  Government
and not to the employee who initiated the collection or the creation.
We  determined  that  the  samples  in  question  were  not  properly
labeled and cataloged and did not constitute a sample of collection.
Even  if  the  samples  had  been  properly  labeled  and  stored,  the  col-
lection could not have been banked at a non-VA institution without
proper approval.

Following  this  incident,  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  has
adopted new policy. On October 19, 2007, we issued Research Data
Security  and  Privacy  Policy  that  specifically  outlines  processes  for
disposition of research and clearly informs researchers that VA re-
search is the property of VA and that investigators cannot take the
collection away from the VA without appropriate approval. The VA
Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  offers  a  robust  research  program
committed  to  contributing  to  science  and  enhancing  care  to  vet-
erans  in  the  broader  community.  We  added  compliance  staff  to  in-
crease research oversight, and leadership is continuing an ongoing,
in-depth review to ensure all VA researchers adhere to the highest
level of human subjects’ protection.

That  concludes  my  statement,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will  be  happy  to

take questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Moreland follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL E. MORELAND

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  Thank  you  for
the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  events  surrounding  the  closure  of  the  Special  Patho-
gens  Laboratory  (SP  Lab)  at  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  (VAPHS).  I  am
joined  today  by  Dr.  Ali  Sonel,  Assistant  Chief  of  Research  and  Development,
VAPHS;  Dr.  Mona  Melham,  Vice  President  Clinical  Support  Service  Line,  VAPHS;
Ms.  Cheryl  Wanzie,  Medical  Technologist;  and  Dr.  Steven  Graham,  Director,  Geri-
atric Research and Education Center (GREC).

VAPHS  is  an  integrated  health  care  system  serving  a  population  of  over  360,000
veterans throughout Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. In Fiscal Year
2007,  VAPHS  served  over  58,000  unique  veterans  and  completed  over  489,000  out-
patient visits. Between 2000 and 2007, the VAPHS research program grew from $11
million  to  over  $24  million  in  funded  research  including  an  initiative  for  a  VA-led
cooperative  study;  this  growth  is  indicative  of  a  healthy  program  that  promotes  a
positive environment for researchers.

Today  I  will  address  the  closure  of  the  SP  Lab,  the  disposition  of  equipment  and
specimens, and VA policies as they were in December 2006. Additionally, I will dis-
cuss some changes we have since instituted to these policies.

Closure of Special Pathogens Laboratory

Let  me  say  at  the  outset  that  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  operated  within  the
VAPHS  as  a  part  of  the  regular  clinical  laboratory  services.  As  such,  the  primary
mission  was  to  support  the  clinical  work  of  the  organization.  Its  original  focus  was
to perform clinical testing for Legionella bacteria for the VA.

Further,  it  should  be  understood  that  research  projects  may  be  and,  are  indeed
encouraged, to be undertaken by VAPHS clinicians in the scope of their VA employ-
ment  if  their  protocols  are  presented  and  approved  by  the  Research  and  Develop-
ment Committee.

The  Research  Foundation,  an  incorporated  not-for-profit  organization,  has  the
mission to support VA research operations. External funding resources are often se-
cured and managed by this foundation for properly approved and sanctioned activi-
ties of VA researchers.

In  January  2006,  the  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  (ACOS)  for  Clinical  Support,  who
oversees all VAPHS’ laboratory functions, reviewed the workload of the SP Lab. She
determined the clinical workload could be managed more efficiently within the main
clinical  laboratory.  She  also  discovered  the  SP  Lab  was  acting  beyond  its  intended
scope.

Following  a  technical  review  by  the  ACOS  for  Clinical  Support,  we  found  it  pre-
sented  a  potential  biohazard  to  both  employees  and  our  veterans.  The  SP  Lab  also
lacked  a  defined  and  approved  research  activity.  The  volume  of  clinical  work  being
performed  in  the  SP  Lab  was  low.  The  ACOS  for  Clinical  Support  determined  that
this  function  could  easily  be  absorbed  by  the  main  clinical  laboratory  at  reduced
cost.  The  supplies  necessary  to  effect  such  a  change  were  minimal  and  the  conver-
sion would free up the time of the full-time VA microbiologist to do other VA work.
These concerns were the basis for the ACOS for Clinical Support’s recommendation
that the VA work of the SP Lab be moved into the main clinical lab and that there
be an additional review of SP Lab research accounts.

On July 5, 2006, the Director of the SP Lab was notified via e-mail and in person
about the lab’s closure and he and his staff were given two weeks to complete work
currently in progress. This notification included instructions to stop accepting speci-
mens  from  external  consumers.  The  Lab’s  ‘‘close-out’’  plans  were  forwarded  to  the
SP  Lab  staff  on  July  7,  and  formal  letters  of  notification  were  delivered  July  10.
The SP Lab closed on July 21, 2006. The members of the lab received clear direction
regarding labeling of existing and new specimens and stored samples, and the mem-
bers  of  the  lab  were  told  to  provide  a  map  for  storage.  Although  these  instructions
were specific, they were ignored.

Investigative Reports

As  VAMC  Director,  I  initiated  an  administrative  board  of  investigation  (ABI)  on
July  19,  2006,  to  review  research  and  financial  activities.  In  addition,  I  expanded
the  scope  of  the  investigation  on  August  4,  2006,  to  include  investigation  of  any
breach  of  security  and/or  patient  privacy  surrounding  activities  in  the  SP  Lab.  The

ABI  determined  the  SP  Lab  was  operating  outside  the  scope  of  services  for  which
it  was  established.  It  had  evolved  into  an  unauthorized  commercial  enterprise,
which  tested  environmental  water  supplies  for  private  companies  (including  hotels,
restaurants, and gas station bathrooms), and was engaged in subcontracting for pri-
vate environmental companies. The SP Lab had a commercial client list in the hun-
dreds  that  included  private  hospitals,  businesses,  municipal  water  authorities  and
other institutions.

Funds were collected and deposited within the foundation accounts. As part of an
internal  financial  review  at  the  VA  Pittsburgh,  financial  concerns  were  raised.
Records indicated that their non-VA invoiced revenue for 2005 was $396,631.41 and
for 2006 was $311,337.71. Since this was found, the Research Foundation has hired
financial  staff  and  enhanced  financial  oversight.  Non-VA  revenue  remained  unobli-
gated.  The  Research  Foundation  has  a  procedure  in  place  for  left  over  funds  from
research  accounts.  These  funds  were  pulled  into  the  foundation  and  used  for  other
projects.

In September 2006, the VA Associate Chief of Staff for Research, conducted a re-
view  of  every  publication  generated  in  the  SP  Lab  and  concluded  that  human  sub-
ject microbiological diagnostic and interventional human research studies were con-
ducted  at  the  VAPHS  without  required  approval  from  the  Institutional  Review
Board  (IRB)  and  the  Research  and  Development  Committee.  To  our  knowledge,  no
individuals were harmed as a result of this research.

We  reported  all  of  these  findings  to  the  VA  Office  of  Research  Oversight  (ORO)
on October 12, 2006. In October 2006, after reviewing these reports of investigations
and  the  actions  taken  by  VAPHS,  ORO  concluded  the  VAPHS  had  adequately  ad-
dressed research non-compliance by suspending the SP Lab from embarking on any
future research projects, eventually closing the lab, and establishing sufficient safe-
guards to prevent similar non-compliance from recurring.

Removal of Equipment and Environmental Specimens

Following  the  closure  of  the  SP  Lab,  furnishings  and  equipment  purchased  with
clinical lab’s funds or with VA Research Foundation funds were moved to the main
clinical  lab.  SP  Lab  staff  were  allowed  to  transfer  equipment  acquired  by  non-VA
funds  to  a  site  off  federal  premises.  Properly  labeled  and  cataloged  clinical  speci-
mens from the SP Lab were also moved to the main lab. Research specimens associ-
ated  with  an  approved  research  protocol,  properly  labeled  and  maintained  by  the
principal  researchers  were  transferred  to  the  main  clinical  laboratory  for  proper
storage.  Those  specimens  that  were  not  labeled,  cataloged,  or  were  in  opened  or
damaged tubes were considered bio-hazardous material and were safely disposed of
in  accordance  with  hazardous  materials  procedures,  safeguarding  patient  care  and
public health. VAPHS water samples were transferred to the clinical laboratory. For
approximately  two  weeks,  VAPHS  sent  water  samples  to  an  outside  vendor  for
Legionella  testing.  After  this  period,  VA’s  clinical  lab  developed  the  ability  to  con-
duct Legionella testing in-house and currently offers this service to several other VA
Medical Centers.

Policy Governing Disposition of Research

In  December  2006,  VHA  Directive  2000–043  (attached)  governed  the  disposition
of  research  collections.  The  Directive  and  a  clarification  memorandum  from  VHA’s
Chief Research and Development Officer (CRADO) addressed the collection and stor-
age of clinical data that could be linked to the human biological specimens. Two ad-
ditional  policies  discussed  record  retention.  VHA  Handbook  1200.05  (attached)
states  that  ‘‘if  an  investigator  leaves  a  VA  facility,  the  original  research  records
must  be  retained  at  the  institution.’’  VA  Handbook  6300.1  (attached)  states  that
‘‘records  and  information  collected  and  created  by  VA  personnel  in  the  conduct  of
official  business  belong  to  the  Federal  Government  and  not  to  the  employee(s)  who
initiated their collection or creation.’’

We  determined  in  December  2006  that  no  VA-approved  research  protocol  existed
to cover the samples in question. The samples were not collected as part of any pre-
viously  approved  research  efforts,  nor  were  they  collected,  labeled,  cataloged  and
properly  stored  to  constitute  a  scientific  collection.  Even  if  the  samples  had  been
properly labeled and stored, the collection could not have been banked at a non-VA
approved institution without a VA investigator.

In response to the investigations of the SP Lab and after the loss of research data
in  another  VISN,  VAPHS  took  steps  to  enhance  awareness  among  staff  of  VA  re-
search  and  lab  policies  and  procedures.  In  March  of  2007,  VAPHS  held  a  two-week
Research Stand Down to ensure staff understood laboratory policies and the impor-
tance of securing sensitive research data.

New Policy Governing Disposition of Research

366

On  October  19,  2007,  VAPHS  issued  Research  Data  Security  and  Privacy  Policy.
The new policy specifically outlines processes for disposition of research and clearly
informs  researchers  that  VA  research  is  the  property  of  VA  and  that  investigators
cannot take what they collect as part of VA-approved research when they leave the
institution. Additionally, local policies and procedures will continue to be revised as
needed, including policy related to tissue, specimen and data banking.

The  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  operates  a  robust  research  program  com-
mitted  to  contributing  to  science  and  enhancing  care  to  veterans  and  the  broader
community.  We  have  added  compliance  staff  to  increase  research  oversight  and
leadership  is  continuing  an  ongoing,  in-depth  review  to  ensure  all  VA  researchers
adhere to the highest level of human subjects’ protection.

This  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  the

Subcommittee may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MICHAEL E. MORELAND

Michael  E.  Moreland  was  appointed  Network  Director  of  the  VA  Healthcare—
VISN  4,  on  December  24,  2006.  In  this  position  he  directs  the  operations,  finances
and  clinical  programs  of  a  health  care  system  that  serves  an  estimated  1.5  million
veterans  throughout  Pennsylvania  and  Delaware,  as  well  as  portions  of  West  Vir-
ginia, New Jersey, Ohio and New York. The system is comprised of ten medical cen-
ters and 40 community based outpatient clinics.

Prior  to  this  appointment,  Mr.  Moreland  had  been  the  Director  of  the  three-divi-
sion VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) since June 18, 2000. Mr. Moreland

HEALTHCARE  SYSTEM,  DEPARTMENT  OF  VETERANS  AF-
FAIRS
Dr.  SONEL.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the
Subcommittee.  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  providing  this  oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  the  events  surrounding  the  disposal  of  various
samples,  from  the  now-closed  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  at  the
VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System.

AND  DEVELOPMENT, 

VA 

I  am  Dr.  Ali  Sonel,  and  I  am  the  Director  of  the  Cardiac  Cath-
eterization  Laboratories  and  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  for  Research
and Development at VAPHS.

To  provide  some  context,  VAPHS  is  home  to  one  of  the  largest
research  programs  in  the  Nation  with  over  $24  million  in  annual
research  expenditures  and  276  active  research  protocols  including
165  human  research  participant  protocols  conducted  by  120  inves-
tigators.

Fostering scientific research and ensuring the safety, rights, and
welfare  of  research  participants  through  compliance  with  local,
State,  and  national  regulatory  requirements  for  protection  of
human  subjects  are  critical  to  our  mission  serving  America’s  vet-
erans.

In September 2006 I became the ACOS for research. Prior to this
time,  I  was  not  involved  with  the  closure  of  the  Special  Pathogens
Lab. The Special Pathogens Lab Director did not contact me to re-
quest  a  transfer  of  any  biological  samples  or  specimens.  The  only
request  I  received  for  transferring  any  specimens  or  samples  was
made by another member of the Special Pathogens Lab staff in Oc-
tober 2006. This researcher inquired about potentially transferring
biological  isolates  derived  from  human  subjects  and  related  envi-
ronmental samples referencing an earlier discussion with the prior

ACOS  for  research.  After  discussing  this  request  with  the  Chief  of
Staff,  I  asked  the  researcher  to  present  us  with  any  required  pa-
perwork  for  such  a  transfer.  In  order  to  better  understand  the  re-
quest,  I  also  asked  our  research  compliance  office  to  determine
what items specifically were being requested for transfer, their con-
dition,  and  whether  or  not  such  a  transfer  would  be  permitted  by
existing  regulation.  However,  I  did  not  receive  any  formal  paper-
work or materials transfer agreements. A meeting was arranged at
the  end  of  November  between  the  VAPHS  Education  and  Compli-
ance  Coordinator  and  Special  Pathogens  Lab  staff  members  so  the
Special Pathogens Lab staff could identify and catalog the samples
and specimens in question. This meeting was scheduled for Decem-
ber 5, 2006.

On December 4, I sent an e-mail to the Chief of Staff to confirm
that there were no administrative barriers for this meeting to take
place.  The  Chief  of  Staff  responded  positively  and  included  ACOS
for Clinical Support on the e-mail string to confirm. The ACOS for
Clinical  Support  indicated  at  3:09  p.m.  on  December  4th  that  the
freezers  containing  the  samples  were  cleaned  out  and  the  freezers
were returned. The Chief of Staff concluded that there were no ma-
terials  left  for  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  staff  to  review  and  sug-
gested  that  they  be  directed  to  the  ACOS  for  Clinical  Support  if
they had any further questions regarding the samples.

At  that  point,  I  had  asked  the  Research,  Education  and  Compli-
ance Coordinator to cancel the meeting with the Special Pathogens
Lab  staff  and  directed  them  to  the  ACOS  for  Clinical  Support  for
any further inquiries.

There were no policies specific to VAPHS as of December 4, 2006,
with regard to this position of tissue or data repositories in a situa-
tion  where  the  investigator  is  no  longer  authorized  to  conduct  re-
search.  VHA  Handbook  1200.5  stipulates  that  if  an  investigator
leaves a VA facility, the original research records must be retained
at the institution. VHA Handbook 6300.1 further notes the records
and  information  collected  and  created  by  VA  personnel  in  the  con-
duct of official business belong to the Federal Government and not
to the employees who initiated their collection or creation.

On  October  19,  2007,  VAPHS  Research  Data  Security  and  Pri-
vacy  Policy  was  issued  outlining  local  policies  regarding  the  secu-
rity  of  research  information.  This  policy,  which  was  written  based
upon  guidance  provided  by  the  Office  of  Research  Oversight  and
Office  of  Research  and  Development,  clearly  states  that  VHS  re-
search  data  belongs  to  the  VA.  The  policy  describing  our  proce-
dures  relating  to  the  disposition  of  research  collection  states  that
any  data  to  be  retained,  reused,  or  shared  for  future  studies  must
be  housed  in  a  data  repository  and  that  the  creation  of  the  reposi-
tory requires the development of policies and procedures that must
be  approved  by  the  VAPHS  IRB  and  the  Research  and  Develop-
ment Committee.

VAPHS  is  currently  developing  a  comprehensive  policy  address-
ing  the  handling  and  disposition  of  research  data  and  collections
including  situations  where  the  investigator’s  appointment  was  ter-
minated  or  in  cases  where  research  data  or  specimens  were  col-
lected  without  proper  regulatory  approvals,  thus  constituted  seri-
ous non-compliance.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALI SONEL

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  would  like  to
thank  you  for  providing  this  opportunity  to  discuss  the  events  surrounding  the  dis-
posal  of  various  samples  from  the  now-closed  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  (SP
Lab)  at  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  (VAPHS).  My  name  is  Dr.  Ali  Sonel
and I am the Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories and the Associate
Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Research and Development at VAPHS.

To provide some context, VAPHS is home to one of the largest research programs
in the Nation with over $24 million in annual research expenditures and 276 active
research  protocols,  including  165  human  research  participant  protocols,  conducted
by  120  investigators.  Fostering  scientific  research  and  ensuring  the  safety,  rights
and  welfare  of  research  participants  through  compliance  with  local,  State,  and  na-
tional  regulatory  requirements  for  protection  of  human  subjects  are  critical  to  our
mission of serving America’s veterans.

In September 2006, I became the ACOS for Research. Prior to this time I was not
involved  with  the  closure  of  the  SP  Lab.  The  SP  Lab  Director  did  not  contact  me
to request a transfer of any biological samples or specimens. The only request I re-
ceived  for  transferring  any  specimens  or  samples  was  made  by  another  member  of
the SP Lab staff in October, 2006. This researcher inquired about potentially trans-
ferring  biological  isolates  derived  from  human  subjects  and  related  environmental
samples,  referencing  an  earlier  discussion  with  the  prior  ACOS  for  Research.  After
discussing  this  request  with  the  Chief  of  Staff,  I  asked  the  researcher  to  present
us  with  any  required  paperwork  for  such  a  transfer.  In  order  to  better  understand
the  request,  I  also  asked  our  Research  Compliance  Office  to  determine  what  items
specifically  were  being  requested  for  transfer,  their  condition  and  whether  or  not
such  a  transfer  would  be.  permitted  by  existing  regulations.  However,  I  did  not  re-
ceive  any  formal  paperwork  or  materials  transfer  agreements.  A  meeting  was  ar-
ranged at the end of November between the VAPHS Research Education and Com-
pliance Coordinator and SPL staff members so the SPL staff could identify and cata-
log the samples and specimens in question. This meeting was scheduled for Decem-
ber 5, 2006.

On  December  4,  I  sent  an  e-mail  to  the  Chief  of  Staff  to  confirm  that  there  were
no  administrative  barriers  for  this  meeting  to  take  place.  The  Chief  of  Staff  re-
sponded positively and included the ACOS for Clinical Support on the e-mail string
to  confirm.  The  ACOS  for  Clinical  Support  indicated  at  3:09  PM  on  December  4th
that the freezers containing the samples were cleaned out and the freezers were re-
turned.  The  Chief  of  Staff  concluded  that  there  were  no  materials  left  for  SP  Lab
staff to review and suggested that they be directed to the ACOS for Clinical Support
if  they  had  any  further  questions.  At  that  point,  I  asked  the  Research  Education
and  Compliance  Coordinator  to  cancel  the  meeting  with  the  SPL  staff  and  directed
them to the ACOS for Clinical Support for any further inquiries.

There  were  no  policies  specific  to  VAPHS  as  of  December  4,  2006  with  regard  to
disposition  of  tissue  or  data  repositories  in  a  situation  where  the  investigator  is  no

collected  and  created  by  VA  personnel  in  the  conduct  of  official  business  belong  to
the  Federal  Government  and  not  to  the  employees)  who  initiated  their  collection  or
creation.’’

On  October  19,  2007,  VAPHS  Research  Data  Security  and  Privacy  policy  was
issued,  outlining  local  policies  regarding  the  security  of  research  information.  This
policy,  which  was  written  based  upon  guidance  provided  by  the  Office  of  Research
Oversight and the Office of Research and Development, clearly states that ‘‘VHA re-
search data belongs to the VA.’’ The policy describing our procedures related to the
disposition  of  research  collections,  states  that  ‘‘any  data  to  be  retained,  reused,  or
shared for future studies, must be housed in a data repository and that the creation
of  the  repository  requires  the  development  of  policies  and  procedures  that  must  be
approved by the VAPHS IRB and Research and Development Committee.’’

VAPHS  is  currently  developing  a  comprehensive  policy  addressing  the  handling
and  disposition  of  research  data  and  collections,  including  situations  where  the  in-
vestigator’s  appointment  was  terminated  or  in  cases  where  research  data  or  speci-

Dr.  MELHEM.  Good  afternoon  and  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  appear  before  you  today.  My  name  is  Dr.  Mona  Melhem.  I  am
the  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  for  Clinical  Support  of  the  VA  Pitts-
burgh Healthcare System. I am also a Professor of Pathology at the
University  of  Pittsburgh,  School  of  Medicine.  I  have  been  a  prac-
ticing  physician  and  a  pathologist  at  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs  in  Pittsburgh  since  1986,  and  I  did  additional  clinical  spe-
cial  qualifications.  I  am  a  board-certified  in  anatomic  and  clinical
pathology  and  hematopathology,  and  I  have  published  more  than
150, peer-reviewed articles and published abstracts of research pre-
sented in national and international conferences.

For  the  past  22  years,  I  have  taken  on  greater  clinical  and  ad-
ministrative responsibilities within the pathology and lab medicine
services  of  the  VA,  and  I  began  my  current  position  as  Associate
Chief of Staff and Vice President of Clinical Support since 2001. In
this  capacity,  I  am  responsible  for  pathology  and  lab  medicine  in-
cluding the clinical microbiology and Special Pathogens Lab.

In  January  2006,  acting  in  my  oversight  capacity,  I  requested  a
routine review of the clinical productivity and financial expenditure
of the Special Pathogens Lab. This lab was chartered in the 1980’s
as  the  clinical  resource  for  VA.  The  lab  was  to  be  financially  inde-
pendent  and  to  serve  the  clinical  needs  of  the  VA  Pittsburgh
Healthcare System and other VA medical centers in what was then
an  emerging  field  of  Legionella  testing.  Based  on  this  review,  it
was  clear  the  lab  was  not  productive  and  was  a  drain  on  clinical
resource.  This  led  me  to  the  decision  to  consolidate  the  Special

Pathogens  Lab  functions  into  the  main  clinical  and  microbiology
labs in the main building.

Of  note,  the  Chief  of  Infectious  Disease  by  law  cannot  be  also
named  administratively  Chief  of  Microbiology  Lab,  and  this  con-
stituted a conflict of interest and self-referral of any specimens that
go to this lab.

In  preparation  for  the  lab’s  closing,  I  ordered  lab  personnel  to
move  all  recognizable,  cataloged  and  well-marked  intact  tubes  and
specimens to the main laboratories to ensure the patients’ confiden-
tiality  and  the  specimens’  integrity.  There  were  several  efforts  to
enlist the cooperation of the then-director of the Special Pathogens
Lab but to no avail.

Upon  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  Director’s  departure,  we  found
a  freezer  filled  with  unidentified  biological  materials  and  micro-
organisms. There was simply no way of knowing the specimens’ or
danger  to  the  public.  Special  pathogens  are  infectious  agents  that
produce  serious  disease  in  humans;  and  so  in  July  of  2006  in  the
interest  of  public  safety  and  the  health  of  our  veterans,  we  re-
quested  the  Vice  President  of  Facility  Management  to  coordinate
the  disposal  of  hazardous  material  and  immediate  cleaning  of  the
Special Pathogens Lab.

These  steps  were  consistent  with  established  procedures  and
guidelines  followed  by  both  public  and  private  laboratories  across
the  world  which  dictate  that  unknown  remaining  specimens  must
be disposed of as soon as possible.

I  was  not  aware  of  any  effort  by  the  staff  of  the  Special  Patho-
gens  Lab  to  transfer  any  samples  to  qualified  labs  at  the  Univer-
sity  of  Pittsburgh.  Some  time  around  September  ’06,  roughly  one
month  after  the  closure  of  the  lab,  I  had  an  informal  conversation
with  the  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  for  Research  and  Development
about  the  specimens  that  were  preserved  after  the  lab  closure.  I
stated  at  that  time  that  we  preserved  specimens  we  knew  to  be
part  of  an  approved  research  protocol  or  would  otherwise  be  able
to  identify.  Well-labeled,  well-cataloged  specimens  from  other  in-
vestigators  were  moved  to  the  main  clinical  lab  under  strict  freez-
ing condition to maintain their integrity.

On  December  4,  I  asked  that  personnel  about  the  status  of  the
remaining  sample,  knowing  then  that  it  had  been  destroyed  and
taken care of some time between July and September. Based on my
earlier  instruction,  I  believed  they  had  already  been  properly  de-
stroyed.  I  was  informed  there  may  be  some  biohazard  material  re-
maining  in  Building  2  where  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  was  lo-
cated.

Since  this  lab  had  been  closed  since  July  of  2006,  I  ordered  an
extensive cleaning and disposal process of all remaining unidentifi-
able, broken, or abandoned tubes.

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I  am  prepared  for

any questions.

in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS)
since 1986. I am also a Professor in the Department of Pathology at the University
of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine. I am a board certified Anatomic and Clinical Pa-
thologist  with  Special  Qualification  in  Hematopathology.  I  have  published  more
than 150 articles in peer-reviewed journals and published abstracts of research pre-
sented at both national and international conferences. For the past 22 years, I have
taken on greater clinical and administrative responsibility within the Pathology and
Lab  medicine  services.  I  began  my  current  position  as  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  and
Vice  President  of  the  Clinical  Support  Service  line  in  2001.  In  this  capacity,  I  am
responsible for Pathology and Lab medicine, including the clinical, microbiology and
Special Pathogens Labs.

In  January  2006,  acting  in  my  oversight  capacity,  I  requested  a  routine  review
of the clinical productivity and financial expenditures of the Special Pathogens Lab.
This lab was chartered in the early 1980s as a clinical resource for VA. The lab was
to  be  financially  independent  and  to  serve  the  clinical  needs  of  VAPHS  and  other
VA  medical  centers  in  what  was  then  an  emerging  field.  Based  on  this  review,  it
was  clear  the  lab  was  not  productive  and  was  a  drain  on  clinical  resources.  This
led me to the decision to consolidate the Special Pathogens Lab’s functions into the
main clinical microbiology labs in the main building.

Of  Note:  The  Chief  of  Infectious  Diseases,  by  law,  cannot  be  also  named  Chief  of

the Microbiology Lab as this constitutes conflict of interest and self-referral.

In preparation for the Lab’s closing, I ordered lab personnel to move all recogniz-
able,  catalogued,  and  well-marked,  intact  tubes  and  specimens  to  the  main  labora-
tories  to  ensure  our  patients’  confidentiality  and  the  specimens’  integrity.  There
were several efforts to enlist the cooperation of the Director of the Special Pathogens
Lab, but to no avail.

Upon the Special Pathogen Director’s departure, we found a freezer filled with un-
identifiable  biological  materials  and  microorganisms.  There  was  simply  no  way  of
knowing the ?specimens’ risk or danger. Dr. Yu’s testimony attested that organisms
were  sent  to  the  SP  Lab  from  all  over  the  world.  Special  pathogens  are  infectious
agents that produce serious disease in humans, and so in July 2006, in the interests
of  public  safety  and  the  health  of  our  veterans,  we  requested  the  Vice  President  of
Facility  Management  coordinate  the  disposal  of  hazardous  material  and  the  imme-
diate cleaning of the Special Pathogens Lab. These steps were consistent with estab-
lished  procedures  and  guidelines  followed  by  both  public  and  private  laboratories
across the world which dictate that unknown remaining specimens must be disposed
of as soon as possible.

I was not aware of any efforts by the staff of the Special Pathogens Lab to trans-
fer any samples to qualified labs at the University of Pittsburgh. Sometime around
September  2006,  roughly  one  month  after  the  closure  of  the  lab;  I  had  an  informal
conversation  with  the  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  for  Research  and  Development  about
specimens  that  were  preserved  after  the  lab  closure.  I  stated  at  that  time  that  we
preserved  specimens  we  knew  to  be  part  of  an  approved  research  protocol  or  were
otherwise able to identify.

On  December  4,  2006,  I  asked  lab  personnel  about  the  status  of  the  remaining
samples.  Based  on  my  earlier  instructions,  I  believed  they  had  already  been  prop-
erly  destroyed.  I  was  informed  there  maybe  some  biohazardous  material  remaining
in Building 2, where the Special Pathogens Lab was located. Since this lab had been
closed  since  July  2006,  I  ordered  an  extensive  cleaning  and  disposal  process  of  all
remaining unidentifiable, broken or abandoned tubes.

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement,  I  am  prepared  to  answer  any  ques-

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  STEVEN  H.  GRAHAM,  DIRECTOR,  GERI-
ATRIC  RESEARCH,  EDUCATIONAL  AND  CLINICAL  CENTER,
VA  PITTSBURGH  HEALTHCARE  SYSTEM,  DEPARTMENT  OF
VETERANS AFFAIRS
Dr.  GRAHAM.  Thank  you.  My  name  is  Steven  Graham,  and  I  am
the  Director  of  the  Geriatric  Research,  Educational,  and  Clinical
Center at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, and I am Professor of
Neurology  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh.  My  own  research  pro-
gram concerns the mechanisms of neuronal cell death and is fund-
ed by the National Institute of Health and Department of Veterans
Affairs.

I  served  as  Associate  Chief  of  Staff  for  Research  at  VA  Pitts-
burgh  Healthcare  System  from  July  2002  until  September  2006.  I
am prepared to discuss my involvement and knowledge of the Spe-
cial Pathogens Lab’s closing and related issues.

In  March  2006  I  participated  in  a  meeting  with  the  senior  VA
Pittsburgh leadership regarding the Special Pathogens Lab. At that
meeting, serious questions were raised about the lab’s lack of peer-
reviewed  research  grants  and  whether  approved  research  was
being conducted in the laboratory. There were also questions about
the  extent  to  which  the  lab’s  activity  supported  veterans’  health
care.

In  April  2006,  I  met  with  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab’s  Director
and  VA  Pittsburgh  senior  leadership  to  discuss  these  concerns.  At
the  meeting  the  lab  director  was  asked  to  provide  a  list  of  institu-
tions and companies for whom the lab was performing studies, the
number  of  VA  studies,  and  a  list  of  all  research  studies  approved
by the Institutional Review Board.

We  asked  the  Lab  Director  to  comply  with  the  requirements  for
IRB  and  R&D  Committee  review  of  his  research  program.  The
VAPHS  Director  directed  that  an  audit  be  conducted  of  the  Lab’s
accounts in the Veterans Research Foundation of Pittsburgh.

I understand that the hospital director later decided to close the
Special Pathogens Laboratory, although I did not participate in any
meetings where this was discussed.

The results of this foundation financial audit and review of addi-
tional documents by the research service suggested the strong like-
lihood  that  the  lab  had  conducted  research  without  prior  approval
from  an  IRB  or  the  Research  and  Development  Committee.  The
VAPHS  Director  and  the  Office  of  Research  Oversight,  ORO,  were
informed of these concerns.

The VAPHS Director convened a Board of Investigation on which
I  served.  I  referred  this  matter  to  VAPHS  Research  Compliance
Committee for further investigation and action.

In  July  2006  I  met  with  the  Director  of  the  hospital,  Chief  of
Staff,  and  the  Research  Administrator  Officer  regarding  the  lab’s
closure.  The  concern  was  raised  that  there  might  be  biohazardous
material  in  the  lab  that  could  constitute  a  safety  hazard.  The  Di-

rector  asked  the  Research  Administrative  Officer  and  me  to  ad-
dress this problem. To the best of my knowledge, the Research Ad-
ministrative Officer and the Biosafety Officer subsequently entered
the laboratories and disposed of all cultures still growing in incuba-
tors  as  well  as  biological  agents  and  chemicals  stored  in  4-degree
refrigerators.  Specimens  kept  in  the  minus-70  freezers  were  not
disposed of at that time.

In  August  of  2006,  I  was  contacted  by  a  former  Special  Patho-
gens  Lab  staff  scientist  and  the  Director  of  the  Special  Pathogens
Lab  regarding  the  possible  transfer  of  equipment  and  reference
specimens  from  the  lab.  I  informed  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  Di-
rector that equipment bought by the Veterans Foundation of Pitts-
burgh  remains  the  property  of  the  foundation,  and  regulations
allow  that  equipment  to  be  transferred  only  to  another  VA  or  VA
Foundation.

I was informed that it would be difficult or impossible to transfer
any human specimens, but it might be possible to transfer bacterial
specimens  to  another  institution.  This  would  require  a  materials
transfer agreement that must be endorsed by the accepting institu-
tion and approved by the VAPHS Administration. At that time, the
new  laboratory  was  not  operational,  so  I  considered  it  premature
to  consider  this  issue  further.  I  did  communicate  this  desire  to
transfer  the  specimens  to  the  Research  Administrative  Officer.  I
have  no  direct  knowledge  of  the  destruction  of  specimens  on  De-
cember 4, 2006.

At  the  request  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  have  also  been  asked  to
comment  on  the  efforts  of  a  schizophrenia  researcher  who  left  VA
Pittsburgh in 1995 to transfer specimens to another institution. In
1998  and  2000,  requests  were  submitted  to  my  predecessor  as
ACOS  for  Research  to  transfer  cerebrospinal  fluid  and  blood  speci-
mens  that  were  obtained  under  an  approved  IRB  protocol  to  an-
other  institution.  The  ACOS  for  Research  eventually  denied  that
request  upon  the  advice  of  the  VA  regional  counsel  and  the  VA’s
Office  of  Research  and  Development.  The  transfer  request  was  not
compatible  with  VHA  directive  2000-043  regarding  Banking  of
Human  Research  Specimens.  Another  investigator  at  VAPHS
agreed  to  take  custody  of  these  samples,  and  they  remain  at  the
hospital to this day.

This concludes my statement. I am prepared to answer any ques-

tions the Subcommittee may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEVEN H. GRAHAM

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  and  thank  you
for this opportunity to discuss issues regarding the closure of the Special Pathogens

ing,  the  Lab  Director  was  asked  to  provide  a  list  of  institutions  and  companies  for
whom  the  lab  was  performing  studies,  the  number  of  VA  studies,  and  a  list  of  all
research  studies  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB).  We  asked  the
Lab  Director  to  comply  with  the  requirements  for  IRB  and  R&D  committee  review
of  his  research  program.  The  VAPHS  Director  directed  that  an  audit  be  conducted
of  the  Lab’s  accounts  in  the  Veterans  Research  Foundation  of  Pittsburgh.  I  under-
stand the VAPHS Director later decided to close the Special Pathogens Laboratory,
although I did not participate in any meetings where this was discussed.

The results of this foundation financial audit and review of additional documents
by the Research Service suggested the strong likelihood that the Lab had conducted
research  without  proper  approval  from  an  IRB  or  the  Research  and  Development
Committee.  The  VAPHS  Director,  the  VA  Office  of  Research  Oversight  were  in-
formed  of  these  concerns.  The  VAPHS  Director  convened  a  Board  of  Investigation
on  which  I  served.  I  referred  the  matter  to  the  VAPHS  Research  Compliance  Com-

In  July  2006,  I  met  with  the  Director  of  VAPHS,  the  Chief  of  Staff,  and  the  Re-
search  Administrative  Officer  regarding  the  Lab’s  closure.  The  concern  was  raised
that  there  may  be  biohazardous  material  in  the  lab  that  could  constitute  a  safety
hazard.  The  Director  asked  the  Research  Administrative  Officer  and  me  to  address
this problem. To the best of my knowledge, the Research Administrative Officer and
the  Biosafety  Officer  subsequently  entered  the  laboratories  and  disposed  of  all  cul-
tures  still  growing  in  incubators,  as  well  as  biological  agents  and  chemicals  stored
in 4° refrigerators. Specimens kept in the -70° freezers were not disposed of at that
time.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  CHERYL  WANZIE,  CHIEF  TECHNOLOGIST,
VA  PITTSBURGH  HEALTHCARE  SYSTEM,  DEPARTMENT  OF
VETERANS AFFAIRS
Ms.  WANZIE.  Good  afternoon,  and  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  appear  before  you  today.  My  name  is  Cheryl  Wanzie.  I  am  an
American Society of Clinical Pathologists, Registered Medical Tech-
nologist  since  1971.  I  have  been  employed  with  the  Department  of
Veterans Affairs since 1973.

My current position is Chief Medical Technologist, Pathology and
Laboratory  Medicine  at  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System.  I  was
responsible  for  overseeing  the  quality  of  the  process  for  clinical
testing  of  samples  from  VA  patients  performed  by  the  Special
Pathogens  Laboratory  and  ensuring  that  the  laboratory  met  the
standards  for  laboratory  accreditation.  I  was  and  am  currently  re-
sponsible  for  allocating  the  clinical  laboratories  supply  budget  and
monitoring associated workload data.

In  January  of  2006,  I  provided  workload  and  cost  data  for  the
Special  Pathogens  Lab  to  Dr.  Mona  Melhem,  Associate  Chief  of
Lab,  Clinical  Support  Service  Line.  After  reviewing  the  data  and
obtaining other information, Dr. Melhem determined that the Spe-
cial  Pathogens  Lab’s  clinical  and  environmental  testing  workload
could be performed more efficiently in the clinical microbiology lab-
oratory.  Dr.  Melhem  asked  me  to  facilitate  and  oversee  the  transi-
tion  of  the  clinical  and  environmental  Legionella  testing  to  the
main  laboratory.  In  June  2006,  Dr.  Melhem  informed  me  that  the
Special Pathogens Laboratory would close in July and that the clin-
ical  microbiology  laboratory  would  assume  both  clinical  and  envi-
ronmental Legionella testing.

On the morning of July 19, 2006, Dr. Melhem, a VAPHS research
scientist,  and  I  met  with  a  staff  member  of  the  Special  Pathogens
Lab——

closer? Apparently, the recorder is having a hard time hearing.

Ms.  WANZIE.  On  the  morning  of  July  19,  2006,  Dr.  Melhem,  a
VAPHS  research  scientist,  and  I  met  with  a  staff  member  of  the
Special  Pathogens  Lab  to  discuss  the  transfer  of  clinical  and  envi-
ronmental  specimens  and  clinical  laboratory  equipment  from  the
Special  Pathogens  Lab  to  the  main  laboratory.  Dr.  Melhem  in-
structed  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  staff  to  consolidate  all  clinical
and  environmental  specimens  in  a  clinical  refrigerator  and  speci-
mens  belonging  to  other  research  scientists  in  a  clinical  ultra-low
freezer  which  would  be  moved  to  the  main  laboratory  that  after-
noon.

Special  Pathogens  Lab  was  also  instructed  to  prepare  an  inven-
tory of the clinical environmental specimens which they never pro-
vided.  In  the  afternoon,  Dr.  Melhem  and  I  supervised  the  transfer
of the equipment and appropriately labeled clinical specimens from
the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  to  the  main  laboratory.  At  that  time,
VAPHS  research  scientist  specimens  were  secured  in  an  ultra-low

freezer  in  the  main  laboratory.  The  remaining  specimens  were  left
in the special pathogens lab which closed on July 21, 2006.

In  the  afternoon  of  December  4,  2006,  Dr.  Melhem  inquired  if
there  were  specimens  remaining  in  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab.  I
responded  that  to  my  knowledge  they  were  still  in  the  Special
Pathogens  Lab.  Dr.  Melhem  informed  me  that  the  Medical  Center
Director considered this to be a concern due to the presence of bio-
hazardous material and directed that the refrigerators and freezers
be  cleaned  out  by  the  end  of  the  day.  I  assembled  some  of  the
microbiology  staff  and  we  proceeded  to  remove  all  improperly  la-
beled  or  uncataloged  specimens  from  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab
using  standard  biohazardous  waste  protocols.  I  cautioned  the  staff
to  take  extra  precautions  because  some  of  the  specimens  were  un-
capped  and  in  broken  glass  tubes.  The  specimens  were  placed  in
double-biohazard  bags,  removed  from  the  building,  placed  in  bio-
hazard  waste  containers  to  be  removed  from  the  facility  by  a  con-
tractor.

In my position as Chief Technologist, I had no knowledge of any
policies  in  effect  on  December  4,  2006,  concerning  the  disposition
of research collections. I am now aware of a VAPHS Research Data
Security and Privacy Policy which ensures protection of private in-
formation and the disposition of research material.

Thank  you.  That  concludes  my  statement.  I  am  prepared  to  an-

swer any questions you may have.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Wanzie follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHERYL WANZIE

Good  morning  and  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  My
name  is  Cheryl  Wanzie.  I  am  an  American  Society  of  Clinical  Pathologist’s  reg-
istered Medical Technologist since 1971. I have been employed with the Department
of  Veterans  Affairs  since  1973.  In  my  current  position  as  Chief  Medical  Tech-
nologist,  Pathology  and  Laboratory  Medicine  at  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  Sys-
tem,  I  was  responsible  for  overseeing  the  quality  of  the  process  for  clinical  testing
of samples from VA patients, performed by the Special Pathogens Laboratory (SPL)
and  ensuring  that  the  laboratory  met  the  standards  for  laboratory  accreditation.  I
was and am currently responsible for allocating the clinical laboratory supply budg-
et and monitoring associated workload data.

In  January  2006,  I  provided  workload  and  cost  data  for  the  SPL  to  Dr.  Mona
Melhem, Associate Chief of Staff, Clinical Support Service Line. After reviewing the
data and obtaining other information, Dr. Melhem determined that the SPL clinical
and environmental testing workload could be performed more efficiently in the clin-
ical  microbiology  laboratory.  Dr.  Melhem  asked  me  to  facilitate  and  oversee  the
transition  of  the  clinical  and  environmental  Legionella  testing  to  the  main  labora-
tory. In June 2006, Dr. Melhem informed me that the SPL would close in July and
that  the  clinical  microbiology  laboratory  would  assume  both  clinical  and  environ-
mental Legionella testing.

On  the  morning  of  July  19,  2006,  Dr.  Melhem,  a  VAPHS  research  scientist  and
I met with a staff member of the SPL to discuss the transfer of clinical and environ-
mental specimens and clinical laboratory equipment from the SPL to the main lab-
oratory.  Dr.  Melhem  instructed  SPL  staff  to  consolidate  all  clinical  and  environ-
mental  specimens  in  a  clinical  refrigerator  and  specimens  belonging  to  other  re-
search  scientists  in  a  clinical  ultralow  freezer  which  would  be  moved  to  the  main
laboratory  that  afternoon.  SPL  staff  was  also  instructed  to  prepare.an  inventory  of
the  clinical  and  environmental  specimens,  which  they  never  provided.  In  the  after-
noon, Dr. Melhem and I supervised the transfer of the equipment and appropriately
labeled  clinical  specimens  from  the  SPL  to  the  main  laboratory.  At  that  time,
VAPHS  research  scientists  specimens  were  secured  in  the  ultralow  freezer  in  the
main  laboratory.  The  remaining  specimens  were  left  in  the  SPL  which  closed  on
July 21, 2006.

In  late  afternoon  of  December  4,  2006,  Dr.  Melhem  inquired  if  there  were  speci-
mens  remaining  in  the  SPL.  I  responded  that  to  my  knowledge  they  were  still  in

the SPL. Dr. Melhem informed me that the Medical Center Director considered this
to  be  a  concern  due  to  the  presence  of  biohazardous  material  and  directed  that  the
refrigerators  and  freezers  be  cleaned  out  by  the  end  of  the  day.  I  assembled  some
of  the  Microbiology  staff  and  we  proceeded  to  remove  all  improperly  labeled  or
uncatalogued specimens from the SPL using standard biohazardous waste protocols.
I  cautioned  the  staff  to  take  extra  precautions  because  some  of  the  specimens  were
uncapped and in broken glass tubes. The specimens were placed in double biohazard
bags,  removed  from  the  building,  placed  in  biohazard  waste  containers  to  be  re-
moved from the facility by a contractor.

In  my  position  as  Chief  Technologist,  I  had  no  knowledge  of  any  polices  in  effect
on  December  4,  2006  concerning  the  disposition  of  research  collections.  I  am  now

BIOGRAPHY FOR CHERYL WANZIE

Cheryl  Wanzie  has  worked  for  the  VA  Pittsburgh  Healthcare  System  since  Janu-
ary  21,  1973.  After  graduating  from  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  with  a  Bachelor’s
of Science in 1970, Ms. Wanzie continued her education in the field of Medical Tech-
nology  at  Presbyterian–University  of  Pennsylvania  Medical  Center  in  Philadelphia,
PA.  After  graduating  in  June  1971,  she  received  certification  as  a  Medical  Tech-
nologist  by  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Pathologists.  After  working  for  a  year
in  Philadelphia,  Ms.  Wanzie  relocated  to  Portland,  Oregon  in  1972  and  accepted  a
Medical  Technologist  position  at  the  VA  Medical  Center.  She  resigned  her  position
for  family  reasons  and  returned  to  Pittsburgh  in  1973.  She  was  offered  a  position
as  a  Medical  Technologist  in  the  Transfusion  Service  at  the  VA  Pittsburgh  and
worked  in  the  Blood  Bank  Laboratory  until  1981.  Ms.  Wanzie  transferred  to  the
Immunopathology  Laboratory  in  1981  and  was  promoted  to  Supervisor  in  1988.  In
this  capacity,  she  supervised  three  Medical  Technologists  and  one  Medical  Techni-
cian  and  was  responsible  for  administrative  and  clinical  duties  in  the  laboratory.
During  this  time,  she  was  appointed  as  a  Field  Instructor  for  the  Medical  Tech-
nology  Program  at  the  University  of  Pittsburgh’s  School  of  Health  Related  Profes-
sions.  Ms.  Wanzie  furthered  her  education  at  the  School  of  Health  Related  Profes-
sions and received a Master’s of Science in 1982. Ms. Wanzie was promoted to Chief
Medical  Technologist  in  1990  and  continues  to  hold  that  position.  In  this  capacity,
she  is  responsible  for  the  administrative  and  clinical  functions  of  Pathology  and
Laboratory Medicine Program. The Program provides both clinical and anatomic pa-
thology laboratory services for three sites at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System,
five  Community  Based  Outpatient  Clinics  and  nine  other  VA  facilities  in  VISN  4.
The  Program  provides  laboratory  services  24  hours  a  day,  365  days  a  year  with  a
staff of 86 FTE. In 1990, Ms. Wanzie received a bronze award for Outstanding Tech-
nical Supervisor from the Pittsburgh Federal Executive Board’s Excellent in Govern-
ment  Awards.  In  1999,  she  was  nominated  and  received  the  gold  award  for  Out-
standing Supervisor/Manager in a Technical Series.

DISCUSSION

Chairman MILLER. Thank you. I understand that all of you have
been  interviewed  by  the  Subcommittee  staff.  That  is  correct.  You
can  just  nod  your  head.  All  of  you  remember?  I  would  assume  it
would be an event you would remember, and do any of you now re-
call differently any event that you talked to our staff about? Do any
of  you  wish  to  correct  anything  that  you  told  our  staff?  Mr.
Moreland?

Mr.  MORELAND.  The  only  thing  I  would  say  is  I  don’t  remember
every  single  word  that  I  said  to  the  Committee  staff.  So  it  would
be very difficult to assert that today.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  I  understand.  I  am  not  talking  about
every  single  word,  but  do  you  remember  the  gist  of  anything  that
you  said  differently  now  from  what  you  recall  saying  something  to
the staff that you now believe, you now recall differently?

Mr.  MORELAND.  Not  a  significant  content.  I  don’t,  and  again,  I

am not trying to be argumentative——

Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  MORELAND.  I  am  just  saying  it  was,  you  know,  a  few  weeks

ago and we had——

ber every word that you said.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  understand  that  nobody  is  going  to  remem-

Mr. MORELAND.—extensive, long conversations.
Chairman  MILLER.  But  you  know  the  gist  of  what  you  told  our
staff.  Do  any  of  you  now  recall  differently  anything  that  you  told
our staff. Dr. Sonel?

Dr. SONEL. I do not recall anything different.
Chairman MILLER. Dr. Melhem.
Dr. MELHEM. I do not.
Chairman MILLER. Dr. Graham.
Dr. GRAHAM. No.
Chairman MILLER. Ms. Wanzie.
Ms. WANZIE. I do not.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. All of you did not submit written testi-
mony  in  advance  but  all  of  you  read  verbatim  from  written  testi-
mony.  Obviously,  it  would  have  been  helpful  to  this  committee  to
prepare for the hearing to have had that testimony in advance, and
all  of  you  obviously  made  a  conscious  decision  not  to  provide  writ-
ten testimony.

Dr.  Sonel,  did  anyone  talk  with  you  about  whether  you  would

provide written testimony in advance?

Dr. SONEL. I was told that we could prepare oral statements and

that they would be our own statements.

Chairman MILLER. Well, but you also read verbatim from a writ-

ten statement, isn’t that correct?

Dr. SONEL. Correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  I  just  saw  you  do  it.  Why  did  you  decide  not
to provide that statement in advance to the Committee which obvi-
ously would have been our preference?

Dr.  SONEL.  We  were  working  with  the  central  office  and  there

Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  not  sure  if  your  microphone  is  on  or  it

was——

is close enough to you.

Dr.  SONEL.  We  were  working  with  VA  central  office,  and  they
were  assisting  us  in  the  submission  process.  So  I  relied  on  them
to——

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Who read your written testimony?
Dr. SONEL. Ms. Lanzendorfer I believe from the VA——
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Anyone else?
Dr. SONEL.—Legislative Affairs. I am not sure if it was circulated
to  other  people,  but  it  was  made  clear  that  it  was  to  be  our  own
statement.

Chairman MILLER. Did she make any suggested changes in your

Dr. SONEL. No material changes.
Chairman  MILLER.  Did  you  talk  to  any  other  witnesses  today

about your testimony?

Dr. SONEL. I shared my planned statement with them, yes.
Chairman MILLER. Did you see their statements?

testimony?

Dr. SONEL. I did.
Chairman MILLER. All right. Dr. Melhem.
Dr. MELHEM. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Did you see anyone else’s statements?
Dr. MELHEM. I did see Mr. Moreland’s.
Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  how  about  Dr.  Sonel,  Dr.  Graham,  Ms.

Dr. MELHEM. I did not read any of them.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Did  you  provide  your  written  state-

ment to anyone else?

Dr. MELHEM. I did send it to Ms. Lanzendorfer in the central of-

Wanzie?

fice.

ment in advance?

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Mr.  Moreland,  who  saw  your  state-

else.

Mr.  MORELAND.  I  submitted  it  to  Congressional  Affairs  like  we
usually do in Central Office, and they saw it and then I know that
I  have  read  the  testimony  in  front  of  the  people  here  on  the  panel
so that we were aware of each other’s statements.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Yes? You were about to say something

Mr.  MORELAND.  But  there  wasn’t  direction  from  either  of  us
about  what  to  say,  it  was  simply  sharing  the  statements  so  we
could make sure what the other one was saying.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Graham.
Dr.  GRAHAM.  Yes,  I  submitted  a  draft  of  my  oral  statement  as
requested to the VA legal affairs. They counseled us not to say any-
thing  about  impending  personnel  actions  because  that  might  vio-
late  the  Privacy  Act,  and  I  actually  recall  that  they  asked  Mr.
Moreland to redact some of his oral statements because they might
not be appropriate for a public statement.

Chairman MILLER. All right. Ms. Wanzie.
Ms. WANZIE. I was asked to provide the oral statement in written
form  to  VA  Central  Office.  I  received  some  responses  back,  some
questions  about  my  statement.  I  did  not  make  any  substantive
changes  to  my  statement.  I  did  read  statements  from  the  rest  of
the panel.

THE CATALOG FOR THE SPL’S COLLECTION

Chairman MILLER. Ms. Wanzie, one of the people, perhaps it was
you,  who  dumped  the  vials  into  the  biohazard  bags  and  took  them
to be incinerated, said that the vials were labeled with or had both
numbers  and  letters  on  them.  Is  that  correct?  Was  that  you  that
said that?

Ms. WANZIE. I said that.
Chairman MILLER. What?
Ms. WANZIE. Yes, I said that.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. All right. Mr. Moreland, you heard the
testimony  of  the  first  panel.  I  assume  that  Dr.  Snydman  and  both
Dr. Stout and Dr. Yu said that those letters and numbers actually
matched  up  to  a  catalog,  and  Ms.  Stout  attached  a  catalog  or  ap-
pended a catalog to her testimony. What is the basis for your state-
ment that they were not cataloged?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:01 Dec 27, 2008 Jkt 043530 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6621 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\090908\43530C SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

390

Mr.  MORELAND.  My  basis  was  that  I  had  never  seen  the  catalog
and  that  despite  numerous  requests,  it  was  not  provided.  The  VA
catalog is actually VA property so if——

Chairman MILLER. Did you ask Dr. Stout for a catalog?
Mr. MORELAND. I did not personally.
Dr.  MELHEM.  I  did  on  several  occasions,  including  in  one  of  the

e-mails.

Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  MORELAND.  By  having  asked  for  the  catalog,  it  was  not  pro-
vided.  So  without  the  presence  of  a  catalog,  one  cannot  ascertain
what  the  numbering  system  means.  And  so  by  the  lack  of  provi-
sion,  it  becomes  a  catalog  system  that  is  not  cataloged  because  it
wasn’t  provided.  And  I  wanted  to  make  clear,  as  I  was  starting  to
say, the catalog actually is the property of the organization. So that
catalog, if it has been removed from the VA and is in the presence
of a non-VA employee and is not provided to the organization, that
is  a  significant  concern  to  me,  sir,  because  it  may  have  private  in-
formation  that  was  not  available  to  the  public  and  should  not  be.
And so despite requests, it was not provided.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Moreland,  did  you  look  on  her  computer?
Mr. MORELAND. I did not look on her computer. It was requested
to  be  provided,  and  so  it  could  have  been  e-mailed,  it  could  have
been  provided  in  written  copy.  And  I  will  mention,  sir,  that  there
were two other significant research projects going on in that build-
ing.  When  we  asked  them  to  provide  a  catalog  of  their  samples,  it
was provided the same day. We easily had the catalog, we had the
samples  labeled.  We  were  able  to  take  those  labeled  catalog  sam-
ples  and  move  them  properly  to  the  clinical  laboratory.  That  was
not possible to do with the Special Pathogens Lab because they did
not provide the requested catalog.

THE TECHNICAL REVIEW’S BIOHAZARD DETERMINATION

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Mr.  Moreland,  you  said  in  your
written  testimony  and  your  oral  statement  that  there  was  a  tech-
nical  review  that  found  that  the  research  specimens  presented  a
potential  biohazard  to  both  employees  and  our  veterans.  Was  that
technical review in writing?

Mr. MORELAND. I will have to defer that question to Dr. Melham.
Dr. MELHEM. Sir, my technical review was mostly concerned with
the  clinical  specimens,  and  the  clinical  specimens  in  a  clinical  lab
can only remain up to two weeks after testing of the clinical speci-
men and——

Chairman MILLER. Right, but we are not talking about——
Dr. MELHEM.—and should have been destroyed at that time.
Chairman MILLER. We are talking about the research specimens.
Was  there  a  technical  review  that  the  research—I  mean,  that  cer-
tainly is the implication of this testimony.

Mr. MORELAND. Well, again, what I would say is as Dr. Melhem
mentioned,  if  you  have  samples  in  a  freezer  and  samples  that  are
not identified, I don’t know what they are. I don’t know what they
could be.

Chairman  MILLER.  But  you  used  the  term  technical  review,  and
that was all oral? It was around the water cooler? It wasn’t in writ-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:01 Dec 27, 2008 Jkt 043530 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6621 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O08\090908\43530C SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

391

ing? There was no scrap of paper generated as a result of this tech-
nical review?

Mr. MORELAND. That is correct. The technical review——
Chairman MILLER. My time is——
Mr.  MORELAND.  The  technical  review  regarding  whether  it  was
biohazard  is  done  basically  done  with  the  clinical  staff,  and  they
went over and looked. So there was not a technical review in writ-
ing.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  My  time  is  expired  for  this  round.

Mr. Rohrabacher?

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Dr.  Melhem,
you  have  responsibility,  it  says,  of  Clinical  Support  Services.  Do
you have any responsibility for overseeing research?

Dr. MELHEM. No, I don’t.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. So you would not have known any of this in-

formation anyway, would you?

Dr.  MELHEM.  Sir,  the  information  I  got  is  the  specimen  that

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  You  would  not  have  known  about  the  re-

would——

search information?

Dr.  MELHEM.  The  information  I  had  is  that  the  specimens  that
were kept in the freezer had patients’ identifications including first
initial and four letters—the Social Security.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  you  had  no  idea  what  type  of  research

that this dealt with?

Dr. MELHEM. Sir, I am a researcher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. I know.
Dr. MELHEM. And I have been a researcher for many years.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  That  is  not  your  responsibility.  That  is  not

your responsibility, is it?

Dr. MELHEM. That is not my responsibility——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right, so——
Dr. MELHEM.—but I know a collection when I see a collection.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  You  know  a  collection?  And  you  spent  a  lot

of time in their lab trying to familiarize——

Dr.  MELHEM.  I  spent  time  looking  through  the  freezers  and

asked several times of the Director who is answering to me——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. How much time did you spend did you spend

looking through their freezer?

Dr.  MELHEM.  Well,  I  looked  at  the  freezers,  I  determined  what

belonged to the catalogs that we had and what did not belong.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. How much time did you spend was the ques-

tion?

Dr. MELHEM. I was——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. An hour?
Dr. MELHEM.—in the freezer——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. One hour?
Dr. MELHEM.—a couple of times.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Two hours? Or are we talking about 30 min-

Dr.  MELHEM.  Probably  a  couple  of  times,  a  half-hour  or  an  hour

utes or 15 minutes?

each.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  A  couple  of  times  or  a  half-an-hour.  Thank
you. You know, when I was a young reporter, I worked for a news

organization  that  hired  me  to  go  to  press  conferences  and  rewrite
statements  by  politicians,  rewriting  their  press  releases  and  sup-
posedly  covering  the  news.  And  I  took  it  upon  myself  to  actually
go out and investigate some stories on my own. You know, I never
had  any  appreciation  from  my  bosses  for  the  public  service  that  I
was  actually  providing  by  investigating  corruption  in  our  city  be-
cause that wasn’t their job. Their job was to rewrite press releases
and  fill  copy.  Excuse  me  if  I  don’t  notice  the  same  sort  of  lack  of
appreciation.  Have  any  of  you,  and  you  are  all  doctors  and  re-
searchers  and  such,  have  any  of  you  had  the  accomplishment  of
finding the source of a bacteria that was causing thousands of peo-
ple  or  risking  thousands  of  people  to  lose  their  lives?  Have  any  of
you  reached  that  plateau  yet  in  your  career  or  is  it  that  you  are
just  looking  through  the  refrigerators  of  people  who  are  involved
with  that  type  of  activity?  I  said  earlier  that,  you  know,  in  Wash-
ington  we  have  to  deal  with  a  lot  of  bureaucratic  problems.  I  cer-
tainly  identify  today  after  your  testimony  that  we  have  got  a  bu-
reaucratic  attitude  problem.  Someone  didn’t  ask  permission,  and
this is my area. Listen, I have got to tell you, I can totally identify
with  what  is  going  on.  I  can  sense  the  personality  problems  that
arose  when  someone  didn’t  ask  permission.  You  know,  I  will  have
to  tell  you,  Dr.  Moreland,  you  are  complaining  that  they  have  a
commercial client group. They are servicing the health needs of cer-
tain  people  in  the  community.  They  have  something  to  complain
about? They were offering a service to identify a deadly bacteria to
the community. Is that what you are complaining about?

Mr. MORELAND. Well, sir, what I would respond to that is the VA

has a very specific mission to take care of veterans.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. That is right.
Mr.  MORELAND.  And 
there 

laboratories——

are  multiple 

commercial

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Like I said——
Mr. MORELAND.—that do the exact kind of testing——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Again, you are talking about the bureaucratic
lines,  and  you  are  upset  that  the  bureaucratic  lines  were  stepped
upon  by  these  people.  By  the  way,  they  may  well  have  not  been—
you  know,  they  have  been  out  of  the  borders.  I  understand  that.
And  I  understand  your  job  is  to  make  sure  that  this  thing  runs
smoothly.  Take  a  look  at  the  bigger  picture  here.  What  you  are
thinking of is a rogue element of scientists looking in through their
microscopes  without  permission.  The  rest  of  us  may  look  at  it  and
say,  hey,  my  uncle  was  saved  because  of  what  this  lady  did.  I  will
have  to  tell  you  I  think  this  type  of  bureaucratic  attitude  comes
with  the  job.  I  am  not  blaming  you  as  individuals.  You  have  been
given  a  responsibility  to  try  to  make  a  huge  organization  and  a
huge  budget,  make  it  work.  I  understand  that,  and  I  respect  that.
I  think  that  when  people  have  that  type  of  responsibility,  quite
often  they  can’t  see  the  forest  for  the  trees  of  what  the  purpose  of
all  of  this  is.  It  is  to  save  people’s  lives,  trying  to  make  the  world
a  little  better  and  these  aren’t  rogues.  These  are  people  trying  to
do  a  good  job,  and  certainly  you  can  reply  to  that  and  I  will  shut
up after that. Go right ahead, Dr. Moreland.

Mr. MORELAND. No, sir, I was simply going to say it wasn’t that
it  upset  me  or  it  angered  me,  it  was  that  it  was  not  appropriate

use of government funds and government work. And there are mul-
tiple  private-sector  groups  that  do  the  exact  same  testing,  and  I
don’t think that it is my place to compete with these private-sector
companies  to  do  referral  lab  services.  And  so  we  are  constituting
our  work  to  make  sure  that  the  clinical  work  of  the  VA  and  our
patients  are  taken  care  of.  And  I  wish  Dr.  Yu  well  in  his  private
endeavor.

FEE FOR SERVICE TESTING POLICIES

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  The  staff  report  found  that  the
Research  Foundation  gave  express  approval  in  1995  to  do  fee-for-
service testing for Legionella. Is that an incorrect finding?

Mr. MORELAND. It is an incorrect interpretation. And so if——
Chairman  MILLER.  What  do  you  mean?  What  is  the  distinction

Mr. MORELAND. Are you referencing the July 5th memo that you

that you are making?

have provided?

revoked?

Chairman MILLER. Yes.
Mr.  MORELAND.  Yes.  That  is  a  discussion  that  went  along  about
doing fee-for-service work for other VA hospitals, and in the memo,
if  you  look,  there  is  a  term  that  is  used  that  makes  that  pretty
clear,  when  it  talks  about  the—in  the  third  paragraph,  the  last
sentence, it says services provided to other VA medical centers can
be paid on an expenditure transfer. This was about providing serv-
ices  to  other  VA  hospitals  and  other  systems  in  the  VA.  And  they
were  doing  that.  And  in  fact,  the  VA  Pittsburgh  continues  to  pro-
vide  those  kind  of  services  to  other  VA  hospitals  who  are  sending
their Legionella samples to the VA Pittsburgh. And Dr. Melhem in
the  clinical  lab  is  indeed  processing  those.  This  was  really  about
that.  And  I  will  also  mention  it  was  1995,  and  this  is  2008  today
and things do change on occasion.

Chairman MILLER. Did you get word that the approval had been

Mr. MORELAND. The approval was internal to the VA Pittsburgh.
Chairman MILLER. I am sorry, what?
Mr. MORELAND. The approval was internal to the VA Pittsburgh,
and so when there is—that approval can be changed internal to the
VA Pittsburgh.

Chairman MILLER. Was it?
Mr.  MORELAND.  Well,  since  I  was  the  hospital  director,  I  would

have made that decision. So what I was looking at——

Chairman MILLER. Did you?
Mr. MORELAND. Yes, I did, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Did you do that in writing?
Mr.  MORELAND.  I  informed  Dr.  Yu  and  others  that  I  was  con-
cerned that we were taking samples from 600 companies across the
United States, some of them outside of the United States, we were
processing  them  and  charging  a  fee.  Those  fees  were  not  covering
the  cost  of  what  was  going  on,  and  it  seemed  to  me  to  be  an  inap-
propriate  use  of  VA  funds  and  VA  services.  And  so  it  was  better
that we not do that business.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Moreland, did you instruct anyone to de-
stroy  the  collection?  You  told  our  staff  earlier  you  did  not  recall
doing that.

cussions?

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Dr.  Sonel,  were  you  part  of  those  dis-

Dr.  SONEL.  Yes,  as  I  indicated  in  October,  by  e-mail  Dr.  Stout
contacted  me,  and  I  made  some  preliminary  arrangements  to  ex-
plore  that  request  further.  And  that  is  why  I  got  the  Research
Compliance Office involved.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. And when did you find out that the col-

lections had been destroyed?

Dr.  SONEL.  That  was  on  December  4th  in  the  afternoon  when  I
e-mailed  my  supervisor,  our  Chief  of  Staff,  regarding  the  planned
meeting between the Special Pathogens Lab staff and the——

Chairman MILLER. What time of day was that?
Dr.  SONEL.  I  believe  that  was  around  3:09  p.m.  is  when  I  e-

mailed our Chief of Staff.

Mr. MORELAND. My memory as I think I said to the staff is that
in  July  I  had  been  very  clear.  I  wanted  any  samples  or  identified
collections that included labeling and mapping, that those samples
should  be  moved  in  whole  over  to  the  clinical  lab  and  stored  prop-
erty,  and  anything  left  would  be  disposed  of  as  excess.  And  I
thought  that  is  what  happened  in  July.  And  so  when  Dr.  Melhem
went  to  the  other  two  researchers  and  asked  for  their  catalog  and
got  them,  those  samples  were  moved.  Frankly,  I  didn’t  know  what
had  happened  to  the  samples  that  were  constituted  there  because
I  assumed  they  either  were  moved  as  a  collection  because  of  map-
ping or they were disposed of as would have been the case with left
over samples.

MORE ON TRANSFERRING THE SPL COLLECTION

Chairman  MILLER.  Were  you  aware  that  continuing  discussions

about transferring them, transferring the sample?

Mr. MORELAND. I don’t recall being aware of that until December

Chairman MILLER. That you found out they had been destroyed?
Dr. SONEL. Shortly after that, within a few minutes when he re-

Chairman MILLER. And at that point, did you have an agreement

sponded and——

to transfer the collection?

Dr.  SONEL.  No,  we  actually—Dr.  Stout  and  I  had  communicated
on  e-mail  that  we  would  require  materials  transfer  agreements,
and I suggested to her that the recipient lab should initiate the pa-
perwork.  But  I  was  never  presented  any  paperwork  for  me  to  re-
view  to  consider  the  transfer  further,  and  part  of  the  intent  of  the
meeting  was  for  the  Special  Pathogens  Lab  to  provide  paperwork,
identify  what  they  were  talking  about,  and  identify  what  they  had
desired to transfer and what condition they were in.

Chairman MILLER. Do you have any idea what Dr. Melhem knew

about the discussions for the transfer of the collection?

Dr. SONEL. I actually want to clarify one thing that Dr. Stout in-
dicated during her testimony that is factually inaccurate. She indi-
cated that Dr. Melhem and I had had a discussion about her intent
to  dispose  of  any  materials  or  samples,  and  we  never  had  such  a
discussion. So the first that I heard about the disposal was Decem-
ber 4th or the intent to dispose was December 4th.

Chairman MILLER. I am sorry. I don’t think that your answer ac-
tually provided an answer to the question I asked. Did you talk to
Dr. Melhem about your negotiations to transfer the collection?

Dr. SONEL. Not during the negotiations themselves. I——
Chairman MILLER. Well, when did you? Did you at another time?
Dr.  SONEL.  When  I  first  took  over  and  we  were  going  over  re-
search  space,  I  do  remember  Dr.  Melhem  showing  a  freezer  that
was  a  remnant  or  residual  of  the  Special  Pathogens  Laboratory  in
one  of  the  research  areas.  And  at  that  point,  I  thought  we  briefly
discussed  that  potentially  getting  those  out  of  there  by  properly
identifying those samples and specimens. That was a verbal discus-
sion, and I do not recall all the details of it. But during the e-mail
communication between Dr. Stout and myself, we did not have any
discussions with Dr. Melhem. At that time, my discussions were di-
rected toward my supervisor.

Chairman MILLER. Just one second, please. Dr. Sonel, do you re-

member sending an e-mail to Rajiv Jain——

Dr. SONEL. Dr. Jain is our Chief of Staff.
Chairman MILLER.—on the day after the destruction of the vials,
I  think  Tuesday,  December  5th.  Next  day.  Next  day.  Do  you  re-
member sending an e-mail?

Dr. SONEL. I do remember communicating with Dr. Jain multiple
times  by  e-mail  during  that  time.  I  don’t  remember  the  specific  e-
mail that——

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  let  me  read  this  one  to  you.  It  is  num-

ber five in your book.

Dr. SONEL. Yes, I do have it here.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  ‘‘Dr.  Jain,  I  appreciate  your  support
and clarification. I am a bit disappointed that I was not give an op-
portunity to process this through the RCC.’’ What is the RCC?

Dr. SONEL. That is our Research Compliance Committee.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. ‘‘Which I feel would have been the due
process  even  if  the  end  result  may  have  been  to  destroy  the  sam-
ples. The samples and their proposed fate to de-identify and release
was discussed in person with Dr. Melhem in end of September. Dr.
Graham  denies  agreeing  to  destruction  of  samples  as  well.  I  sin-
cerely  hope  we  can  avoid  such  a  confusion,  and  I  would  truly  ap-
preciate  being  kept  in  the  loop  if  data  or  specimen  destruction  is
considered  when  it  may  be  linked  to  approved  or  non-approved  re-
search.’’ Is that the e-mail that you sent?

Dr. SONEL. Yes.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. So you did not think then that the pro-

cedures to decide to destroy the collection were appropriate?

Dr.  SONEL.  Actually,  I  don’t  think  that  e-mail  necessarily  says
that. My intent in that e-mail is to indicate what the process would
have  been  had  we  discovered  unauthorized  research.  Now,  in  this
case, I believe there was concern that there was no clear knowledge
of what these remaining specimens and samples were and whether
they were indeed clinical or research. But our normal process if an
investigator  conducts  unauthorized  research  and  collects  a  body  of
information  or  samples  or  specimens  without  authorization  or  in-
formed  consent  from  the  subjects,  then  the  Research  Compliance
Committee would make a determination as to the fate of those data
and  the  samples  and  specimens  collected  in  that  process.  And  to

give  you  an  example,  there  have  been—if  there  is  an  instance
where  no  informed  consent  was  obtained  but  somebody  collected
blood  samples  from  patients,  for  example,  and  stored  them,  then
the  Research  Compliance  Committee  would  evaluate  that  serious
non-compliance  and  as  part  of  that  evaluation  would  then  look  at
what  would  be  done  with  those  collected  samples.  And  in  the  ab-
sence  of  informed  consent,  the  usual  action  RCC  takes  in  those
cases is to actually destroy the samples because the primary deter-
minant  that  the  RCC  considers  is  the  subject’s  intent  as  to  what
was to be done with the samples.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Sonel,  you  have  just  described  this  as
kind  of  an  abstract  discussion  of  procedures,  but  this  chain  of  e-
mails all had to do with specific destruction of this set of Legionella
and other bacteria samples, didn’t it?

Dr. SONEL. This was related to the collection in question and the

rest of this e-mail string, correct.

Chairman MILLER. All of you saw the first panel discussion, and
you  heard  Dr.  Yu  and  Dr.  Stout  and  Dr.  Snydman  say  that  this
was  a  very  valuable  collection  that  had  been  used  in  many  peer-
reviewed  articles.  Dr.  Stout  said,  for  instance,  it  had  been  useful
to her in developing the protocols for dealing with Legionella in the
water supply VA hospitals and that the research collection was in-
valuable  for  that  work.  We  have  just  heard  that  this  was  just  a
bunch  of  broken  bottles.  Dr.  Sonel,  do  you  believe  the  testimony
given by the first panel was not true with respect to the value and
the scientific integrity of that sample?

Dr. SONEL. I cannot comment to the actual value of the scientific
value of the collection that they are talking about, and that is due
to  the  fact  that  the  protocols  that  we  have  had  at  hand  and  the
only existing protocol that was in effect at the time that the Special
Pathogens Lab was closed, did not make any reference to retaining
any collection of samples or specimens, though a scientific protocol
should describe how the collection is going to be accumulated, what
are going to be the storage conditions——

Chairman MILLER. That is an entirely——
Dr.  SONEL.—and  how  they  are  going  to  be  disposed  of.  So  what
I am trying to say is we can review research based on the protocol
and the materials that are provided to us, and that is what guides
how they are collected and how they are stored; and I did not have
that  information  so  I  cannot  tell  you  how  valuable  that  collection
was because I had no way of verifying that that, what was disposed
of that we are discussing, is actually what they indicated is.

Chairman MILLER. I think what you just said is you don’t know?
Dr. SONEL. I do not know.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Did you do anything to find out?
Dr.  SONEL.  That  was  my  intent  when  I  arranged  that  meeting
with  the  Research  Compliance  Office  and  the  Special  Pathogens
Lab  staff  was  to  find  out  what  the  request  was  about,  what  it  en-
tailed, what sort of samples were in question. That is correct. I did
not know what they were.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  they  were  destroyed  before  you

could in fact——

Dr. SONEL. Yes, apparently they were disposed of before we could

have that meeting or that request further.

Chairman MILLER. Did Dr. Melhem consult with you at all know-
ing  that  you  were  in  discussions  about  what  to  do  with  the  sam-
ples,  apparently  her  decision  to  destroy  all  the  samples,  all  of  the
bacteria?

Dr.  SONEL.  She  did  not.  The  first  time  Dr.  Melhem  directly  got
into  that  e-mail  string  was  that  afternoon  about  that  meeting.  So
prior  to  that  there  was  no  discussion,  and  after  that,  she  did  not
discuss the disposition with me.

MORE ON REASONS FOR DESTROYING THE SPL COLLECTION:

PROCEDURAL FLAWS OR PERSONALITY CONFLICTS?

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Melhem,  you  heard  the  testimony  of  the
first  panel.  It  was  a  first-rate  collection  of  research  samples  that
represented  30  years  of  research,  that  it  was  cataloged,  it  was
stored in the appropriate manner, and now you have testified that
these were just some loose broken bottles. Was the first panel testi-
fying  incorrectly?  Did  Yu  testify  to  it  incorrectly?  Did  Dr.  Stout?
Did Dr. Snydman?

Dr.  MELHEM.  Sir,  Dr.  Stout  is  a  full-time  clinical  lab  employee,

and as such her mission was to test clinical patient specimens.

Chairman MILLER. That is really not the question at all.
Dr.  MELHEM.  The  specimens  in  the  freezer  were,  as  far  as  I  am
concerned, clinical patient specimens that were not—were to be de-
stroyed  within  two  weeks  after  the  clinical  results  have  been  re-
leased into the computer and the patients taken care of.

Chairman  MILLER.  You  did  not  understand  that  any  of  the  vials

in the refrigerator were for research specimens, not clinical?

Dr.  MELHEM.  Sir,  I  have  asked  Dr.  Stout  to  present  us  with
whatever  lists  and  maps  or  boxes  or  whatever  in  that  freezer  and
she did not comply.

Chairman  MILLER.  Did  you  tell  her  that  unless  I  get  something

from you by December 4th I am destroying all this stuff?

Dr. MELHEM. I did not, and I don’t have to because I have asked
her  three  times  in  a  row  between  January  and  April  or  May,  and
there was no answer and no reply.

Chairman  MILLER.  Now,  you  mentioned  earlier  that  that  was  in

one e-mail. Were they all in e-mails? Were they all in writing?

Dr.  MELHEM.  We  had  a  meeting  with  her  that  also  included  the
Chief  of  Pathology  and  Lab  Medicine  and  the  then-Chief  of  Infec-
tious Disease.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Melhem, I think Ms. Wanzie also verified
as did Dr. Stout and Dr. Yu that this collection, the vials, has num-
bers  and  letters  on  them,  suggesting  that  there  was  a  catalog  sys-
tem in place. Do you deny that?

Dr. MELHEM. I have not seen any log or any map of that——
Chairman MILLER. But you saw the vials?
Dr. MELHEM. They looked like patients’ first letter and four-digit
of  Social  Security  number  which  we  use  to  identify  patient  speci-
mens.

Chairman MILLER. You thought they were clinical specimens?
Dr. MELHEM. I thought they were clinical specimens.
Chairman  MILLER.  Did  you  ask  anyone  whether  that  was—did
Dr.  Stout  and  Dr.  Yu  tell  you  that  they  were  research  specimens?

Dr.  MELHEM.  Dr.  Stout  and  Dr.  Yu  were  not  cooperative  in  any
of  these  encounters  with  them,  with  their  staff,  with  anybody.  Dr.
Stout  came  to  the  lab  at  midnight  between  the  19th  of  July  and
the  20th  of  July  and  took  away  boxes  and  boxes  of  patients’  care
material  and  took  them  off-site  with  the  help  of  two  non-VA  per-
sonnel.  And  I  have  no  idea  what  was  taken  away.  I  have  no  idea
what came back. This is not good faith.

Chairman MILLER. Is that why you destroyed the samples?
Dr.  MELHEM.  This  was  not  why,  I  am  just  telling  you  that  they
have no cooperation. I had no cooperation of any kind from the peo-
ple who are now claiming responsibility.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Melhem,  I  really  don’t  need  to  be  per-

suaded that all of you all didn’t get along all that well.

Dr.  MELHEM.  I  had  no  problem  with  any  of  them.  That  is  not

true. That is not true.

Mr.  MORELAND.  Sir,  I  would  just  say  that  in  every  organization,
there  are  certain  procedures  and  rules  that  need  to  be  followed,
and  one  of  the  responsibilities  that  I  had  as  a  hospital  director  is
that  research  must  be  done  to  protect  humans  and  it  has  to  be
done in compliance with rules and regulations. And so that was one
of  the  major  issues  that  we  had,  and  a  scientific  collection  must
have  a  catalog.  And  if  a  researcher  is  requested  to  provide  that
catalog,  it  should  be  provided  immediately.  All  the  other  research-
ers  in  that  building,  two  of  them  with  substantial  collections,  im-
mediately provided that catalog and assisted us in the move. What
I was left with——

Chairman MILLER. Well——
Mr. MORELAND. What I was left with, sir——
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Moreland——
Mr.  MORELAND.—was  a  collection  of  things  that  were  unidenti-

Chairman  MILLER.—from  your  testimony  earlier  today  and  from
what  you  have  said  to  our  staff,  other  than  a  discussion  in  July,
you were not part of this decision to destroy the samples, isn’t that
right?

Mr. MORELAND. Yeah, and my assumption was that in July, any-
thing  that  was  collected  and  had  a  catalog  was  moved,  everything
else was destroyed.

Chairman  MILLER.  You  were  not  part  of  the  decision  on  Decem-

fied.

ber 4th?

Mr. MORELAND. No.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  So  your  statement  really  doesn’t  per-
tain  to  any  question  I  have  asked.  Well,  the  testimony  has  been
quite  at  variance  with  the  documents  that  were  earlier  provided
and  with  the  staff  interviews,  and  I  thought  that  this  hearing
today  would  probably  be  the  end  of  our  committee’s  involvement
and  may  be  the  end  of  our  committee’s  involvement.  But  it  might
be the end of this decision generally, this issue generally. But per-
haps  not.  I  have  no  further  questions,  and  this  hearing—I  don’t
think that I have actually formally moved to enter documents into
the record. But without objection, it is so ordered. And you all have
written testimony in front of you. Will you provide that to the Com-
mittee now? All five of you? Okay. The hearing is adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 1:37 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.
