HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

An Overview of the Federal

R&D Budget for Fiscal Year 2006

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2005

11:00 A.M.–1:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Wednesday,  February  16,  2005,  the  House  Science  Committee  will  hold  a
hearing  to  consider  President  Bush’s  fiscal  year  2006  (FY06)  budget  request  for  re-
search  and  development  (R&D).  Five  Administration  witnesses  will  review  the  pro-
posed budget in the context of the President’s overall priorities in science and tech-
nology.  The  Science  Committee  will  hold  a  separate  hearing  on  February  17th  to
examine the budget request for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA).
2. Witnesses

ment, Dr. McQueary served as President of General Dynamics Advanced Technology
Systems,  and  as  President  and  Vice  President  of  business  units  for  AT&T,  Lucent
Technologies, and as a Director for AT&T Bell Laboratories.

3. Background
Overall Budget

On  February  7,  2005,  President  Bush  delivered  his  FY06  federal  budget  to  Con-
gress.  Overall  discretionary  spending  is  increased  by  2.1  percent—roughly  equiva-
lent to projected inflation. Consistent with budgets of recent years, discretionary ac-
count  increases  are  focused  heavily  on  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  and  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  activities,  which  grow  by  just  under  five  and
seven  percent,  respectively.  Non-defense,  non-homeland  security  discretionary
spending is reduced by nearly one percent.
Research and Development (R&D) Budget

The President’s R&D budget proposes to spend $132.3 billion, an increase of $733
million,  or  one  percent,  over  FY05.1 The  largest  increases  for  R&D  go  to  the  Na-
tional  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA,  $537  million,  or  4.8  percent),
DOD  ($417  million,  or  0.06  percent),  and  DHS  ($282  million,  or  23.8  percent).  All

other  agencies  collectively  receive  an  average  decrease  of  1.0  percent.  The  one  per-
cent  R&D  growth  reflects  increases  in  development  ($1.2  billion,  or  two  percent).2
Applied  research  ($3  million,  or  0.0  percent)  and  basic  research  (¥$320  million,  or
¥1.2 percent) are flat and slightly lower, respectively.
Science and Technology Budget

The  Federal  Science  and  Technology  (FS&T)  budget  is  a  way  of  presenting  the
budget  that  was  recommended  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences;  it  focuses  on
spending  for  actual  research  by  excluding  areas  such  as  defense  development,  test-
ing, and evaluation. In the FY06 budget, funding for FS&T declines by 1.4 percent,
to  $60.8  billion.  The  FS&T  budgets  of  DOC  and  DOE  are  particularly  affected,  re-
ceiving 14 percent and five percent cuts, respectively.
Administration Highlights and Perspective

Consistent  with  the  President’s  overall  budget  priorities,  the  request  for  R&D  fo-
cuses on homeland security and defense spending while limiting the growth in over-
all  spending.  The  Administration  argues  that  science,  technology,  and  innovation
are  given  relative  priority  in  the  budget,  noting  that  non-defense  budget  authority
declines  by  0.26  percent,  while  non-defense  R&D  budget  authority  is  increased  by
0.74 percent.

The  Administration  also  emphasizes  several  ways  of  looking  at  the  R&D  budget
that go beyond year-to-year proposals. For example, the budget notes that in FY06,
13.6  percent  of  total  discretionary  outlays  will  go  to  R&D,  the  highest  share  since
1968  and  the  heyday  of  the  Apollo  program.  The  budget  also  compares  the  request
level  for  many  agencies  and  programs  to  FY01,  underscoring  the  fact  that  overall
R&D  has  increased  45  percent  since  2001  (an  annualized  rate  of  7.7  percent),  and
funding for NSF and NASA have increased by 25 and 19 percent, respectively, since
FY01.

Critics counter that figures based on R&D do not give a clear picture of what has
been  happening  to  research  because  the  category  is  so  weighted  toward  develop-
ment.  They  also  point  out  that  even  in  the  research  category  some  agencies  have
done  far  better  than  others.  DOD  alone  accounts  for  almost  70  percent  of  R&D  in-
creases  over  the  last  five  years,  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  and
DHS account for almost 75 percent of the remaining civilian R&D increases. During
that  same  period,  trends  at  other  agencies  range  from  modest  increases  (DOE:  10
percent,  and  that  includes  defense  development  programs)  to  modest  cuts  (DOC:  -4
percent;  EPA:  -5  percent).  Critics  also  note  that  the  figures  that  start  in  FY01  are
based on final appropriations, which reflect Congressional as well as Administration
actions.  Similarly,  critics  note  that  the  figures  that  start  with  FY01  include  Con-
gressional earmarks, which for other purposes (see below), the Administration backs
out of its baseline spending figures.

For a number of science agencies (perhaps most notably the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric  Administration,  or  NOAA),  the  Administration  argues  that  it  is  pro-
posing  significant  programmatic  increases  even  though  the  total  proposed  for  FY06
is  below  that  for  FY05.  That  is  because  the  FY05  number  includes  numerous  Con-
gressional  earmarks  for  specific  grants.  The  Administration  argues  that  the  ear-
marks  should  be  removed  from  the  FY05  baseline  to  get  a  truer  picture  of  what  is
being  proposed.  The  budget  document  reflects  the  Administration’s  continued  and
growing  concern  over  Congressional  earmarks  within  R&D  accounts.  The  budget
cites a study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science that cal-
culated  that  earmarks  for  R&D  at  academic  institutions  increased  by  nine  percent
from  2004  to  2005,  and  now  total  over  $2.1  billion—up  from  $296  million  only  ten
years  ago.  The  Chronicle  of  Higher  Education  has  estimated  that  R&D  earmarks
now account for eight percent of all federal funding to colleges and universities.

The Administration also emphasizes that evaluations of agency and program man-
agement are considered in determining proposed budgets. Agencies are evaluated by
the Executive Branch Management Scorecard, which rates agencies with green, yel-
low,  and  red  lights  in  areas  such  as  financial  management,  e-government,  and
human  capital  management.  Agencies  under  the  Science  Committee’s  jurisdiction
scored  very  well  on  these  evaluations.  Of  the  26  agencies  evaluated,  DOE,  NASA,
and NSF were three of only seven to receive three or more green lights.
4. Primary Issues

Here  are  some  key  questions  raised  by  the  FY06  budget  request  along  with  rel-

evant background:

2 Defense development is by far the largest factor in the overall R&D increase, accounting for

$1.4 billion in added spending.

Overall Funding Levels and Balance

Regardless  of  how  science  fares  in  the  proposed  FY06  budget  in  comparison  with
other program areas, the figures are unarguably quite tight and are projected to re-
main  so  for  several  years.  What  would  the  impact  of  such  austerity  be  on  the  re-
search  agenda,  on  U.S.  leadership  in  science  and  technology,  on  the  production  of
future  scientists  and  engineers?  The  budget  also  would  do  little  to  increase  the  rel-
ative strength of research in the physical sciences, which have fallen far behind the
biological sciences as a percentage of the federal research budget. Increasing the rel-
ative  strength  of  the  physical  sciences  has  been  a  priority  of  the  scientific  commu-
nity  (including  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology,  or
PCAST)  and  of  the  Congress,  as  reflected  in  several  Science  Committee  bills  that
have  been  signed  into  law  in  the  past  four  years,  including  the  NSF  Authorization
Act  of  2002,  the  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act,  and
the  Cyber  Security  Research  and  Development  Act.  All  of  those  laws  authorize  sig-
nificantly  more  for  the  physical  sciences  than  has  been  provided  in  appropriations
or in the FY06 request.
Basic Research at the Department of Energy

The  debate  over  the  relative  strength  of  the  physical  sciences  often  focuses  on
funding  for  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  Office  of  Science,  which  is  a  major
source of funding for the physical sciences. Congress last year provided an increase
of  almost  four  percent  for  the  Office—the  first  significant  growth  in  many  years—
but the FY06 budget would reduce funding for the Office by almost four percent (or
by about two percent if earmarks are removed from the FY05 baseline). The impact
on  grants  to  individual  researchers  would  be  far  larger,  perhaps  as  great  as  a  10
percent  cut,  because  so  much  of  the  Office’s  budget  is  spent  on  the  costs  of  large
user facilities run by the National Laboratories. How high a priority should research
at  the  Office  of  Science  be  in  the  President’s  budget?  The  Office  of  Science  has  not
fared  well  in  budget  requests  compared  to  the  National  Science  Foundation,  which
is in many ways a ‘‘sister agency’’ that focuses on basic research.
Applied Energy Research

Funding  for  applied  research  in  the  FY06  budget  is  focused  on  a  few  long-range
initiatives,  such  as  the  President’s  hydrogen  initiative.  Excluding  the  hydrogen/
FreedomCAR  activities,  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  R&D  for  FY06
would  be  cut  by  11  percent,  to  $687  million.  Does  the  budget  appropriately  balance
funding  for  technologies  that  could  be  deployed  in  the  nearer-term  with  research  on
long-run advances like hydrogen? The budget also proposes the elimination of DOE’s
oil  and  gas  R&D,  which  have  been  rated  as  ‘‘ineffective’’  by  the  Office  of  Manage-
ment and Budget. Is the elimination of these programs warranted?
NSF Education Funding

The  FY06  budget  request  cuts  the  Education  and  Human  Resources  (EHR)  ac-
count  at  NSF  by  12  percent  (and  by  22  percent  below  the  FY04  level  of  $938  mil-
lion).  NSF  has  indicated  that  the  reductions  in  elementary,  secondary  and  under-
graduate education are part of a conscious policy to significantly pare its role in pro-
gram  implementation,  allowing  these  to  migrate  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Edu-
cation. Should NSF continue to play a significant role in science and math education
at all levels of schooling?
Technology Programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
While the internal laboratories at NIST are slated to receive a 12 percent increase
in  the  FY06  budget  proposal,  the  President  proposes  to  eliminate  the  Advanced
Technology  Program  (ATP)  and  to  halve  the  budget  for  the  Manufacturing  Exten-
sion Partnership program (MEP). Both programs were created by Congress in 1988.
ATP, long a source of controversy, provides grants to companies for pre-competitive
research. MEP runs centers, partly funded by states, throughout the country to help
smaller manufacturers take advantage of the latest technology. Last year, the budg-
et proposed to eliminate MEP, but the Administration later retreated from the pro-
posal.  Should  ATP  and/or  MEP  be  eliminated?  How  high  a  priority  are  they  com-
pared to other activities at NIST?
5. Interagency Research Activities

The  Administration  has  not  proposed  any  new  interagency  R&D  initiatives  for

FY06.
National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI):  NNI,  interagency  program  that  co-
ordinates federal support for nanoscale R&D, continues to be a high priority of both
the Administration and the Science Committee. Between FY01 and FY05, spending

6

on  federal  nanotechnology  R&D  more  than  doubled,  rising  from  $464  million  in
FY01  to  $1.1  billion  in  FY05.  The  FY06  budget  requests  an  estimated  $1.05  billion
for  the  program  in  FY06,  a  decrease  of  $27  million,  or  2.5  percent,  from  the  esti-
mated  FY05  level.3 Requested  funding  for  the  five  agencies4 authorized  in  the  21st
Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  (P.L.  108–153)  is  $666  mil-
lion,  which  remains  well  below  the  $890  million  authorized  for  these  agencies  for
FY06 in the Act.
Networking  and  Information  Technology  R&D  (NITRD):  NITRD  is  described
as  a  ‘‘collaborative  effort  of  many  federal  agencies  [and]  the  Nation’s  principal
source  of  long-term,  fundamental  information  technology  (IT)  R&D,  including  ad-
vanced  technologies  in  high-end  computing  systems  and  software,  high-speed  net-
working, software assurance and reliability, human-computer interaction, and infor-
mation  management.’’  For  the  fourth  straight  year,  the  budget  request  does  not  in-
clude  an  increase  for  NITRD.  This  year,  the  request  is  $2.2  billion,  a  4.5  percent
decrease  below  the  estimated  FY05  level.  A  significant  part  of  this  decrease  is  due
to a reduction in funding at NASA, which is redirecting funds from a number of pro-
grams to better support the President’s vision for space exploration. Within NITRD,
the  work  on  High  End  Computing  R&D  is  down  six  percent,  due  in  part  to  a  drop
in funding in this area at DOE Office of Science.
Cyber Security R&D: Proposed funding for cyber security R&D programs remains
flat. At NSF, the budget requests $67.5 million for cyber security R&D (up two per-
cent),  but  proposes  cutting  funding  for  cyber  security-focused  education  programs
(down 27 percent to $12 million). At NIST, the request is $19 million for cyber secu-
rity  R&D  (the  same  level  as  in  FY05).  All  of  these  proposed  funding  levels  are  sig-
nificantly  below  the  levels  authorized  in  the  Cyber  Security  Research  and  Develop-
ment  Act  (P.L.  107–305).5 Within  the  DHS  Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  Direc-
torate, the FY06 budget requests $16.7 million for cyber security R&D, down seven
percent from the FY05 level.6
Climate  Change  Research:  The  FY06  budget  requests  $1.9  billion  for  the  inter-
agency  Climate  Change  Science  Program  (CCSP),  about  the  same  level  as  enacted
in  FY05.  There  is  a  $100  million  (eight  percent)  decrease  in  NASA’s  contribution
to CCSP, offset primarily by a $57 million (46 percent) increase in NOAA and a $15
million  (21  percent)  increase  in  USDA’s  contributions  to  the  program.  The  request
for CCSP includes $183 million for the interagency Climate Change Research Initia-
tive  (CCRI),  a  17  percent  decrease  above  the  FY05  enacted  level.  It  is  unclear  why
CCRI was reduced when these activities have been a high priority for the Adminis-
tration in past years. CCRI is intended to target critical scientific uncertainties and
deliver results in three to five years.
The  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP):  NEHRP  is
an interagency effort aimed at reducing earthquake hazards through activities such
as seismic and engineering research, earthquake monitoring, and code development
and  adoption.  It  includes  NIST,  NSF,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  and  the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The complete NEHRP budget for
FY06  has  not  yet  been  provided  to  the  Committee.  However,  the  NSF  request  is
$53.98  million,  roughly  flat  compared  to  FY05,  and  USGS  receives  $51.34  million,
up from $46.89 million in FY05. Included in the USGS NEHRP budget is $8.2 mil-
lion  for  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  (ANSS).  In  FY05,  NIST  and  FEMA
were  funded  at  $1.8  and  $20.5  million,  respectively.  The  Committee  remains  con-
cerned that NIST NEHRP funding will not be sufficient to carry out its new respon-
sibilities as the lead agency for NEHRP.

3 The  budget  estimates  agency  funding  levels  for  the  National  Nanotechnology  R&D  Program
activities,  but  the  data  are  not  entirely  consistent  from  year  to  year.  This  is  in  part  because
discrepancies  arise  due  to  the  fact  that  some  nanotechnology  research  is  difficult  to  identify  or
classify.

4 The  five  agencies  authorized  by  the  Act  are:  NSF,  DOE,  NASA,  EPA,  and  NIST.  The  total

funding authorized by the Act for these agencies is $3.7 billion over four years.

5 For FY06, NSF cyber security programs are authorized at $134 million and NIST cyber secu-

rity programs are authorized at $77 million.

6 DHS  also  supports  operational  cyber  security  programs,  such  as  national  alerts  about  exist-
ing  computer  and  network  vulnerabilities.  Located  in  the  National  Cyber  Security  Division  of
the  Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection  Directorate,  operational  cyber  security
receives roughly $73 million (a $6 million increase) in FY06.

6. Agency R&D Highlights
Department of Energy (DOE)

7

The  FY06  request  for  civilian  R&D  at  DOE  of  $5.4  billion  represents  a  decrease
of five percent from FY05 enacted levels. The Administration’s top funding priorities
for  energy  science  programs  are  hydrogen  R&D,  operating  funds  for  scientific  user
facilities, and fusion research.
Office of Science

The  budget  proposes  cutting  funds  for  the  Office  of  Science  by  $137  million  (-4
percent),  to  $3.46  billion.  The  budget  request  indicates  a  higher  priority  for  oper-
ating  funds  for  scientific  user  facilities.  The  request  includes  double  digit  funding
for the operations of new facilities such as the Spallation Neutron Source (+$74 mil-
lion)  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  and  four  new  Nanoscale  Science  Research
Centers (+$43 million), and a 10 percent cut for funding for research grants.

The budget proposes to cancel plans for the physics facility at the Fermi National
Laboratory  known  as  BTev.  BTev  was  one  of  20  facilities  included  in  the  Office  of
Science  20-year  facilities  plan  released  last  year.  A  DOE  scientific  advisory  panel
recommended that if the project was not initiated by 2008, it should be canceled in
favor  of  other  pending  large  facilities  proposals.  The  budget  request  no  funds  for
construction  of  the  Rare  Isotope  Accelerator  (RIA),  a  nuclear  physics  facility  ac-
corded relatively high priority in the 20-year facilities plan. The budget requests $4
million for RIA-related R&D in FY06. (A site for RIA has not been selected; Argonne
National Laboratory and Michigan State University are the finalists.)

The request for fusion R&D is up $17 million overall, (+6 percent, to $291 million)
with funding for ITER (an international partnership to build a large-scale fusion re-
actor)  up  $51  million  (+113  percent  to  $56  million),  although  site  negotiations  have
been stalled for more than a year as France and Japan compete to host the project.
The  large  increase  for  ITER  could  result  in  reduced  funding  for  basic  fusion  re-
search and curtailed operating time on existing fusion facilities in the U.S.

In  other  program  changes,  the  budget  proposes  a  $126  million  reduction  in  fund-
ing  for  Biological  and  Environmental  Sciences  (¥22  percent  to  $456  million)  with
proposed cuts targeted primarily in the Medical Applications and Measurement area
that  hosts  numerous  Congressional  earmarks.  The  budget  also  proposes  a  $25  mil-
lion reduction for Advanced Scientific Computing (¥11 percent to $207 million). On
the other hand, the budget proposes a $20 million increase (+28 percent to $87 mil-
lion) for Genomics.
Applied Energy Programs

The  FY06  budget  proposes  reduced  funding  for  energy  efficiency  and  renewable
energy  (EERE)  R&D  programs  while  increasing  funds  for  hydrogen  R&D.  Overall
funding  for  EERE  R&D  activities  is  cut  $54  million  (¥5  percent  to  $975  million)
but,  if  the  hydrogen/FreedomCAR  activities  are  excluded,  energy  efficiency  and  re-
newable  energy  R&D  is  cut  by  11  percent  ($79  million),  to  $687  million,  from  the
FY05 enacted level of $766 million.

In  specific  EERE  programs,  significant  cuts  were  requested  for  Building  Tech-
nologies  (¥12  percent  ,  ¥$8  million  to  $58  million),  Industrial  Technologies  (¥25
percent,  ¥$18  million  to  $57  million),  and  the  Biomass  program  (¥18  percent,
¥$16 million, to $72 million).

In fossil energy, overall funding is cut $80 million (¥14 percent to $491 million).
DOE  proposes  to  eliminate  oil  and  gas  technology  research,  allocating  $10  million
to  each  program  for  orderly  termination  of  ongoing  activities.  Both  these  programs
were scored ‘‘Ineffective’’ by OMB for the last two years. The stationary fuel cell pro-
gram  (Distributed  Generation),  is  cut  by  $12  million  (¥16  percent  to  $65  million).
In  coal  programs,  there  is  an  overall  increase  of  $13  million  (+4.9  percent  to  $286
million),  with  shifts  in  programmatic  emphasis.  Carbon  Sequestration  gets  a  re-
quested  increase  of  $22  million  (+48  percent  to  $67  million)  while  the  coal-based
fuels  program  is  cut  $10  million  (¥31  percent  to  $22  million)  and  Advanced  Re-
search is cut $10 million (¥28 percent to $31 million). FutureGen, the proposed $1
billion  dollar  project  to  build  a  zero-emissions  coal  plant,  is  funded  at  $18  million,
the same as last year’s appropriation.

In  the  nuclear  area,  funding  for  civilian  activities  in  Nuclear  Energy  is  up  $15
million,  (+4  percent  to  $389  million).  In  the  research  and  development  programs,
Nuclear  Power  2010  is  up  $6  million  (+13  percent  to  $56  million),  Generation  IV
is  up  $5  million  (+13  percent  to  $45  million)  and  Nuclear  Hydrogen  up  $11  million
(+124 percent to $20 million). The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program and
the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative are not funded.

The  Office  of  Electric  Transmission  and  Distribution  and  Energy  Assurance  re-
ceives a $25 million decrease (¥20 percent to $96 million), with the majority of the
cut (¥$20 million) coming from R&D programs.
Issues/Questions Raised by the FY06 Request for DOE
Hydrogen R&D:  The  budget  requests  a  significant  increase  for  R&D  for  hydrogen
as  a  fuel  for  transportation,  while  reducing  funds  for  energy  efficiency  and  renew-
able  energy  R&D.  In  addition  to  questions  raised  at  the  front  of  this  charter,  the
focus  on  hydrogen  raises  an  additional  question.  Hydrogen  must  be  produced  from
other  energy  sources,  so  if  renewable  energy  research  is  not  well  supported,  it  may
not  be  possible  to  produce  hydrogen  in  the  quantities  necessary  for  transportation
without relying on imported energy.
Facilities vs. Research Grants: Traditionally  DOE  has  maintained  a  balance  be-
tween research grants and laboratory activities. Since DOE is the leading source of
civilian  physical  sciences  research  funding,  as  well  as  a  large  portion  of  other  civil-
ian  basic  research,  the  reduction  of  grants  to  enable  user  facilities  to  continue  to
operate raises a fundamental question about the role of the Office of Science. Should
the Department focus on providing the large-scale equipment and facilities that sci-
entists need and leave the funding of individual experiments to others (whether in-
side  or  outside  government),  or  should  the  department  strive  to  have  a  mix  of  both
research grants and facilities accessible to users?

National Science Foundation (NSF)

The National Science Foundation is the primary source of federal funding for non-
medical  basic  research  conducted  at  colleges  and  universities  and  serves  as  a  cata-
lyst  for  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  education  reform  at  all
levels.

The  FY06  budget  request  for  NSF  is  $5.61  billion,  an  increase  of  2.4  percent,  or
$132  million  over  the  FY05  level.  However,  because  NSF  received  a  3.1  percent
($180  million)  cut  in  FY05,  the  overall  request  level  for  FY06  is  approximately  one
percent  below  the  FY04  level.  Also,  the  budget  requests  overstates  the  increase  in
NSF’s actual buying power because it includes $48 million for NSF to begin paying
for  Coast  Guard  activities  in  Antarctica  that  had  previously  been  paid  for  by  the
Coast Guard.

For the second year in a row, the largest percentage increases in the budget pro-
posal  are  for  personnel,  administrative  initiatives,  and  construction  of  major  re-
search  facilities.  Specifically,  the  Research  and  Related  Activities  (RRA)  account,
which funds most NSF research programs, receives a 2.7 percent increase (including

10

the  Coast  Guard  funds).7 The  Education  and  Human  Resources  (EHR)  Directorate,
as mentioned earlier, receives a 12 percent cut.

NSF continues to receive high marks from the Office of Management and Budget
for  the  quality  of  its  management  and  the  excellence  of  its  programs.  Building  on
its  performance  in  the  FY05  budget,  NSF  was  one  of  only  seven  agencies  awarded
three  green  lights  on  the  Executive  Branch  Management  Scorecard.  In  addition,
eight  NSF  programs  were  examined  using  the  Program  Assessment  Rating  Tool
(PART) 8. All eight programs received ratings of ‘‘Effective’’ (the highest rating). NSF
was  the  only  agency  in  the  Federal  Government  to  receive  the  highest  rating  on
every program that was ‘‘PART-ed.’’
Issues/Questions Raised by the FY05 Request for NSF
Education  and  Human  Resource  Directorate  (EHR):  Of  the  seven  budget  cat-
egories  within  the  Education  and  Human  Resources  Directorate,  four  receive  major
budget cuts ranging from 12 to 43 percent (Table 2): Math and Science Partnerships
(MSP),  Elementary,  Secondary,  and  Informal  Education  (ESIE),  Undergraduate
Education  (DUE),  and  Research,  Evaluation,  and  Communication  (REC).  Most  pro-
grams within these accounts are planning reductions in the number of new awards
in 2006, and two—MSP and REC—will not make any new awards.

The  Department  of  Education  also  runs  an  MSP  program.  (Both  were  created  by
Congress as part of the No Child Left Behind initiative). The Education Department
program  receives  a  proposed  FY06  increase  of  $91  million  to  $269  million,  but  it  is
significantly different from its NSF counterpart. The Department of Education’s pro-
gram awards funds to states on a formula basis and focuses primarily on high-level
mathematics  while  NSF’s  program  provides  competitive,  merit-reviewed  grants  to
universities  and  school  districts  to  improve  math  and  science  proficiency  for  stu-
dents of all grades.

Investments in graduate education and in human resource development, or activi-
ties to broaden participation in STEM fields, fare better. In graduate education, the
request  of  $155  million  will  enable  NSF  to  maintain  its  current  stipend  of  $30,000
for  top  graduate  students  and  further  broaden  participation  in  these  programs.  In
human resource development, the funding request of $118.4 million will provide on-
going support for programs and activities that expand opportunities for traditionally
under-served populations.
Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC): The FY06
budget  request  proposes  $250  million  for  this  account,  $76  million  (44  percent)
above  the  FY05  level  for  this  account,  which  funds  large  user  facilities.  (NSF  pro-
vides  funding  to  private  entities,  usually  university  consortia,  to  run  the  facilities.)
The  FY06  budget  provides  money  for  no  new  starts  despite  a  backlog  of  projects.
Five major facilities have been completed in the past two years. Each completed fa-
cility,  such  as  the  new  research  station  at  the  South  Pole,  requires  support  for  re-
search  as  well  as  operations  and  maintenance  funding  once  it  comes  on  line.  Those
funds  come  out  of  NSF’s  research  budget.  Consequently,  as  MREFC  projects  begin
operations,  increasing  budget  pressure  is  placed  on  core  research  activities.  NSF
faces a difficult and growing challenge in balancing these two needs.
Grant  Proposal  Success  Rate:  Even  as  the  total  funding  for  NSF  has  increased
significantly  over  the  past  six  years  (up  40  percent),  the  percentage  of  funded  pro-
posals  has  declined  from  33  percent  in  FY00  to  an  estimated  20  percent  in  FY05.
For FY06, NSF has set a goal of halting the decline in the success rate while main-
taining grant size and duration. Given this constraint, and the relatively flat budget
requested,  NSF  will  try  to  reduce  the  number  of  proposals  it  receives,  in  part  by
reducing the number of solicitations the agency issues.

7 The  transfer  was  proposed  in  an  attempt  to  address  ongoing  disagreements  between  NSF
and  the  Coast  Guard  regarding  the  proper  cost  to  the  Coast  Guard  of  conducting  ice-breaking
activities.  NSF  faces  both  short-  and  long-term  questions  regarding  ice-breaking  operations.  In
the short-term, it remains unclear whether $48 million is a sufficient amount to pay for the ac-
tivities.  In  the  long-term,  Congress  and  the  Administration  must  consider  how  best  to  replace
the current ice-breaking ships, which are aging rapidly.

8 PART  is  described  by  the  budget  as  a  tool  ‘‘developed  to  assess  and  improve  program  per-
formance so that the Federal Government can achieve better results. A PART review helps iden-
tify a program’s strengths and weaknesses to inform funding and management decisions aimed
at making the program more effective.’’

Homeland Security R&D
Homeland Security R&D at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

The vast majority of R&D at DHS is funded by the Science and Technology (S&T)
directorate.  Proposed  funding  for  S&T  is  $1.37  billion,  an  increase  of  $253  million
(23 percent) above the FY05 enacted level. Approximately half of this increase is not
for  new  research,  but  reflects  the  proposed  transfer  into  the  S&T  directorate  of  ex-
isting science programs that are now run by other parts of DHS, particularly by the
Transportation  Security  Administration.  The  Science  Committee  has  encouraged
this  consolidation.  Even  after  this  transfer  is  taken  into  account,  the  funding  for
DHS S&T still increases by $126 million (11 percent).

One major new initiative within DHS S&T is the formation of a Domestic Nuclear
Detection  Office  (DNDO)  ($227  million,  of  which  $124  million  is  new  funding).  The
DNDO will be located at DHS, but will include representatives from other agencies,
such as DOE and DOD. The Office will be responsible for R&D related to detection
of  nuclear  and  radiological  materials,  but  will  also  coordinate  the  acquisition  and
deployment  of  a  national  domestic  nuclear  detection  system  and  the  establishment
of  protocols  and  training  for  users  of  detection  equipment.  Other  new  initiatives  in
DHS S&T include a new program on detection of certain chemical agents and initial
work on a national bio- and agro-defense facility.

S&T  Directorate  funding  is  split  among  various  technical  portfolio  areas,  such  as
biological  countermeasures,  standards,  critical  infrastructure  protection,  and  sup-

port  of  conventional  DHS  missions  (such  as  the  Secret  Service);  a  complete  list  of
portfolios and their funding is provided in Table 3. Most of the portfolio areas, other
than  those  directly  involved  in  the  initiatives  described  above,  remain  flat  or  de-
crease slightly.
Homeland Security R&D at Other Agencies

Approximately  $2.8  billion  is  proposed  for  homeland  security  R&D  programs  in
departments and agencies outside of DHS (Table 10). The bulk of this funding, $1.8
billion (up 3.2 percent from FY05), is for bio-defense programs at NIH, such as basic
research  on  infectious  microbial  agents,  applied  research  on  diagnostics,  vaccines,
and  therapies,  and  construction  of  bio-safety  facilities.  The  remaining  funds  (ap-
proximately  $1.1  billion)  go  to  a  number  of  other  agencies,  such  as:  EPA,  for  re-
search  on  detection  of  chemical  and  biological  agents  in  the  water  supply;  NSF,  for
research  related  to  critical  infrastructure  protection  and  microbial  genomics;  the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), for research on animal disease diagnostics
and vaccines; DOD for detection systems, protective gear, and vaccines for biological
and  chemical  agents;  and  DOE’s  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration  for  re-
search on detection and attribution of radiological and nuclear materials.

In  addition  to  individual  agency  programs,  a  number  of  cooperative  efforts  be-
tween  DHS  and  other  agencies  exist:  NSF  and  DHS  jointly  fund  a  cyber  security
testbed;  DHS  provides  funding  to  NIST  for  standards  work  in  a  number  of  areas,
such  as  standards  for  radiation  detectors;  and  EPA  and  DHS  co-fund  a  university
center on microbial risk assessment.
Issues/Questions Raised by the FY06 Request for DHS
Balance  of  DHS  S&T  Programs:  Most  of  the  work  of  the  Directorate  is  heavily
weighted toward development. Relatively little goes to fund longer-term, more basic
research.  As  a  result,  relatively  little  of  the  funding  is  available  to  universities,  al-
though  DHS  S&T  does  fund  several  university  centers.  Whether  this  shorter-range
focus is optimal for U.S. long-term security has been a matter of debate.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
NIST’s Laboratory Programs

The  FY06  budget  requests  $426  million  for  a  wide  range  of  research  conducted
at  NIST  laboratories  in  Gaithersburg,  Maryland,  and  Boulder,  Colorado.  The  re-
quest is $47 million (12 percent) above the FY05 enacted level of $378 million, and
is slightly above the FY05 request. NIST’s budget was severely cut in FY04, leading
to  early  retirements  and  disruption  of  NIST’s  program  activities.  The  FY05  appro-
priation restored enough funding to maintain current programs and personnel.

The Administration’s request for FY06 includes $40 million for initiatives in three
broad thematic areas: Advances in Manufacturing ($20 million), Measurements and
Standards  for  Homeland  Security  ($3  million),  and  New  Measurement  Horizons  for
the U.S. Economy and Science ($17 million).

The  Advances  in  Manufacturing  initiative  is  intended  to  strengthen  U.S.  efforts
to  commercialize  nanotechnology,  to  improve  software  to  better  coordinate  the  ac-
tivities  of  all  the  suppliers  involved  in  manufacturing  a  particular  product,  and  to
improve  U.S.  competitiveness  by  making  sure  that  technical  standards  abroad  do
not  disadvantage  U.S.  products.  Measurements  and  Standards  for  Homeland  Secu-

rity  will  fund  a  permanent  research  program  at  NIST  in  biometrics  (the  use  of
equipment to identify people by such biological means as fingerprints, iris patterns,
etc.),  and  the  development  of  better  standards  for  equipment  for  firefighters  and
other  first  responders.  New  Measurement  Horizons  for  the  U.S.  Economy  and
Science  will  increase  NIST  research  in  such  areas  as  biotechnology  and  quantum
computing—fields in which the U.S. needs to establish and sustain a leadership role
if it is to be competitive.
Issues/Questions Raised by the FY06 Request for NIST
National Nanomanufacturing and Nanometrology Facility (N3F): To open its
new  manufacturing  laboratory  to  nanotechnology  users  outside  the  government,
NIST  needs  specialized  equipment,  and  a  dedicated  budget  to  maintain  the  facili-
ties.  Although  the  FY06  budget  requests  the  maintenance  funding,  the  request  for
equipment  is  much  less  than  the  $25  million  requested  (but  not  appropriated)  for
FY05.  As  a  result,  the  N3F  may  not  be  sufficiently  equipped  to  support  the  goals
of the National Nanotechnology Initiative.
Impact  of  Proposed  Elimination  of  the  Advanced  Technology  Program
(ATP): The FY06 budget request proposes to eliminate ATP, but provides no funds
for  the  orderly  shut  down  of  the  program,  including  the  costs  to  reassign  or  elimi-
nate  228  positions.  These  costs  could  be  as  high  as  $20  million.  Moreover,  ATP  is
expected to fund an estimated $13 million worth of R&D conducted at the NIST lab-
oratories in FY05. Therefore, the proposal to end ATP could result in one-time costs
to NIST of up to $33 million, eating up much of the proposed increase for the NIST
laboratories.
Impact  of  Scaling  Back  the  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (MEP)
Program:  The  FY06  request  for  MEP  is  $46.8  million,  which  represents  about  a
60  percent  cut  from  the  FY05  enacted  level  of  $109  million.  At  this  level,  it  is  un-
clear how the MEP program would function as a national network.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

The FY06 budget requests $3.6 billion for NOAA, a decrease of $300 million (eight
percent) compared to the FY05 enacted level of $3.9 billion. However, NOAA’s FY05
budget  includes  approximately  $430  million  worth  of  Congressionally  mandated
projects.  If  these  earmarks  are  removed  from  the  FY05  baseline,  then  the  Presi-
dent’s  budget  could  be  construed  as  proposing  an  additional  $200  million  (six  per-
cent increase) for NOAA in FY06.
National Weather Service

The FY06 budget requests $839 million for the National Weather Service (NWS),
an  increase  of  $56  million  (seven  percent).  The  request  includes  $8.7  million  to  ex-
pand  and  modernize  technology  capabilities  at  the  NWS,  including  upgrades  to  the

Tsunami Warning and Detection System

The FY06 budget request includes $9.5 million for NOAA to expand the U.S. Tsu-
nami Warning Network, an issue considered by the Committee during a hearing on
January 26, 2005. This request, combined with $14.5 million in supplemental funds
in  FY05,  will  allow  NOAA  to  procure  and  deploy  tsunami  detection  buoys  in  a  sys-
tem designed to provide continuous tsunami warning capability for both the Pacific
and Atlantic coasts of the United States and in the Caribbean.
Satellite Acquisition

The  FY06  budget  requests  $964  million  for  satellite  programs  at  NOAA.  This  re-
quest is a $57 million (six percent) increase over the FY05 enacted level of $907 mil-
lion. The increase is for procurement, acquisition, and construction of the next gen-
eration of weather satellites, and is in line with the long-term budget plans for these
satellite  systems.  NOAA’s  polar-weather  satellites  are  vital  for  three  to  seven  day
weather  forecasts,  tracking  of  severe  weather  such  as  hurricanes,  and  for  climate
observations. The next-generation of polar satellites is currently under development,
with the first launch planned for 2010.
Issues/Questions Raised by the FY06 Request for NOAA
Weather Satellite Cost Increases:  In  September  2004,  the  Government  Account-
ability  Office  (GAO)  completed  a  report  for  the  Committee  on  the  costs  and  risks
associated with NOAA’s next-generation polar satellite program. The current projec-
tion  for  the  cost  of  the  next  generation  polar  satellite  system  has  risen  from  $6.5
billion to $8.1 billion and GAO estimates it is likely to rise by another $500 million
before the system is complete. The Committee recently learned that availability one
of  the  key  sensors  on  the  new  polar  satellite  will  be  delayed  by  16  months  due  to
technical  difficulties  in  developing  the  sensor.  Cost  overruns  in  satellite  programs
could force NOAA to take resources away from other important core missions at the
agency.
Tsunami Warning Network: While the FY06 budget (along with the FY05 supple-
mental appropriations request) funds the purchase of new tsunami detection buoys,
funding in the out-years for the operation and maintenance of the proposed tsunami
warning  system  is  uncertain.  Each  buoy  costs  approximately  $500,000  to  purchase
and  deploy  and  has  a  design  life  of  less  than  two  years,  so  NOAA’s  estimated
$350,000  for  annual  operation  and  maintenance  seems  inadequate.  Also,  funding  is
uncertain  for  tsunami  education  and  outreach  programs,  which  witnesses  told  the
Committee are as important as tsunami detection in preventing deaths.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay. The hearing will come to order.
I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  to  what  might  be  seen  as  the
official opening of budget season for the House Science Committee.
I am pleased to say that we will be hearing this morning from most
of the top science officials in the Federal Government.

I am especially gratified to welcome Secretary Bodman here this
morning. His presence here signals the new cooperative science-ori-
ented  leadership  he  will  be  bringing  to  the  Department  of  Energy.
I  know  that  we  will  have  the  same  productive  relationship  with
Sam  Bodman  at  DOE  that  we  did  when  he  was  Deputy  Secretary
of  Commerce,  and  I  am  pleased  to  have  him  back  in  this  commit-
tee’s orbit. Mr. Secretary, welcome back.

But  while  I  am  delighted  to  have  so  much  talent  arrayed  before
us  this  morning,  one  would  hardly  describe  the  tone  of  this  morn-
ing’s  hearing  as  festive.  The  budget  proposal  before  us  raises  seri-
ous questions about our nation’s direction in the coming years.

While  the  President’s  budget  proposal  for  research  and  develop-
ment  can  legitimately  be  seen  as  a  glass  half  full  or  a  glass  half
empty,  no  one  could  describe  it  as  a  glass  that  is  filled  enough  to
satisfy the Nation’s thirst for scientific advancement.

Let me elaborate.
The budget is a glass half full in that R&D, as a whole, has fared
better, and basic research has fared no worse than non-defense do-
mestic discretionary spending as a whole. In other words, it would
be unfair to describe the attitude behind this budget as in any way
‘‘anti-science.’’  We  are  living  through  a  period  of  stringent  aus-
terity,  and  the  science  budget  reflects  that  rather  than  any  hos-
tility toward science.

There  are  also  some  grace  notes  in  the  otherwise  dirge-like  tone
of  the  budget.  The  National  Science  Foundation  gets  one  of  the
largest  increases  in  the  budget,  although  not  enough  to  keep  pace
with  inflation,  especially  after  the  Coast  Guard  transfer  is  sub-
tracted.  And  the  internal  laboratories  of  the  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology,  a  top  priority  of  this  committee,  would
receive a 12 percent increase.

But this budget is also a glass half empty. Key science agencies,
most  notably,  perhaps,  DOE’s  Office  of  Science,  would  see  their
budgets  cut.  NSF  education  programs  would  be  cut  by  12  percent,
about  as  misguided  a  policy  as  one  could  imagine.  I  should  say
Congress tried going down this foolhardy path with regard to NSF
in the early 1980s and quickly and wisely reversed course.

And  perhaps  most  disturbingly  of  all,  the  outlook  for  the  out-

years seems to be more of the same.

Now, I don’t doubt that science growth will have to be restrained
in this budget environment. We might have to eliminate some pro-
grams,  such  as  the  oil  and  gas  research  programs  the  Administra-
tion has targeted.

But  I  think  we  have  to  think  long  and  hard  about  whether  it  is
in the long-term interest of the United States to have a multi-year
period of real dollar cuts in spending on research and development.
And  we  have  to  think  more  clearly  about  what  our  priorities  are
in  a  period  of  restrained  growth,  a  topic  I  will  be  returning  to  at
tomorrow’s hearing on NASA’s budget.

With  so  much  at  stake,  I  am  eager  to  turn  to  our  witnesses,  al-
though  they  may  no  longer  feel  so  eager  themselves.  I  understand
that  each  of  them  has  devoted  large  portions  of  their  careers,  very
distinguished  careers,  I  might  add,  to  creating  a  healthy,  effective,
federal  science  establishment.  It  is  our  job  to  help  them  get  more
‘‘wallet’’  to  go  with  their  ‘‘will,’’  to  hearken  back  to  a  phrase  from
President Bush.

Let me end on a more positive note. For us to review the budget
effectively,  we  need  the  maximum  amount  of  information  from  the
Administration.  In  the  past,  one  of  our  frustrations  has  been  get-
ting accurate numbers for what was being spent on the interagency
high  performance  computing  program,  another  of  this  committee’s
priorities. Dr. Marburger and Josh Bolten and I had a flurry of cor-
respondence on this last year.

I  am  pleased  to  say  that  this  year  those  numbers  arrived  here
on  time,  as  required  by  law.  And  I  want  to  thank  Dr.  Marburger
and  his  staff  and  the  staff  at  OMB  and  the  relevant  agencies  for
working  cooperatively  with  us  on  this.  It  will  make  all  our  jobs
easier, and it reflects the great working relationship we have, even
as  we  may  disagree  on  some  budget  decisions.  So,  please  commu-
nicate my thanks to all involved on this.

Mr. Gordon.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  join  you  in
welcoming  this  very  distinguished  panel.  And  also,  as  usual,  I
could just say amen to my Chairman’s opening statements on most
occasions.  And  I  want  to  say  amen  again.  This  is  a  very  distin-
guished panel, and I know all of you have spent a career and a life-
time  trying  to  make  our  country  more  advanced  in  the  sciences,
and we thank you for that.

And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree  with  you  as  to  your  analysis  of  the
budget.  And  I  also  agree  that  the  science  budget  today  could  have
been  worse.  But  that  doesn’t  mean  that  we  just  take  what  we  get
and passively make lemonade out of lemons. We can not ignore the
cumulative damage this is going to do to our nation’s future.

This  is  my  second  year  as  Ranking  Member,  and  I  come  to  you
today  even  more  distressed  about  the  lack  of  foresight  shown  in
putting together this R&D budget than I was last year.

I  am  particularly  concerned  that  reports  have  claimed  that  Dr.
Marburger  called  this  a  ‘‘pretty  good  year’’  for  research  funding.
How can this be a ‘‘pretty good year’’ when the federal science and
technology budget decreased by $877 million?

How  can  this  Administration  contend  that  a  12.4  percent  cut  to
K–12  science  and  math  education  is  a  ‘‘pretty  good  year,’’  or  a  six
percent  decrease  in  NASA’s  aeronautics,  $320  million  less  to  basic
research  and  an  8.2  percent  cut  to  NOAA  research  even  after  the
tsunami disaster that we just witnessed? That doesn’t sound to me
like a ‘‘pretty good year.’’

I  wish  that  was  the  end  of  the  list,  but  it  is  only  the  beginning.
NSF is over $5 billion behind the authorized level that this Admin-
istration  signed  into  law.  The  Department  of  Energy  research  was
slashed 4.1 percent for their Office of Science, cut three percent for
high-energy physics research, and cut 8.4 percent for nuclear phys-
ics.

And  I  want  to  remind  everyone  that  research  in  nuclear,  high-
energy, and condensed matter physics is not just some random aca-

demic  exercise.  Research  in  these  areas  has  led  to  many  remark-
able  innovations,  including  PET  scans,  MRIs,  nuclear  medicine,
and cancer research.

The  Manufacturing  Extension  Program,  probably  the  most  effec-
tive federal program in providing immediate help to U.S. manufac-
turers,  is  again  slashed  severely.  The  Advanced  Technology  Pro-
gram  is  again  eliminated,  and  technology  transfer  programs  at
NASA and DOE are cut. It makes no sense to cut job creation pro-
grams when U.S. manufacturing is losing tens of thousands of jobs
to overseas competition.

This  was  not  a  ‘‘pretty  good  year,’’  not  under  any  circumstances.
The  current  approach  of  this  Administration  is  shortsighted.  It
ignores  the  vital  role  that  research  performed  today  plays  in  our
quality  of  life  and  our  world  position  tomorrow.  We  can  and  we
must  do  better  to  secure  our  nation’s  future  prosperity.  And  we
must redefine the discussion. We need to consider science and tech-
nology research as an investment.

I  have  said  it  before,  and  I  will  say  it  again  today,  maintaining
a  lead  in  science  and  technology  is  a  flat-out  race.  If  we  stop  run-
ning at the top speed we can manage, we will lose. Even in the cur-
rent  fiscal  crisis,  this  budget  is  not  the  top  speed  we  can  manage
for science and technology investment. Lack of investment in inno-
vation  now  will  come  to  roost  later,  or  as  my  father  used  to  say,
we are eating our seed corn.

We  all  understand  the  need  for  reasonable  cuts  and  budget  re-
alignments,  but  we  must  do  so  with  an  eye  towards  our  country’s
future. I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
try  to  realign  the  Administration’s  spending  priorities  to  better
meet our science and technology needs and to guard our future fis-
cal prosperity.

Thank you, and I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Thank you Mr. Chairman. I join you in welcoming our distinguished panel to this
morning’s  hearing.  And  I  agree  with  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  science  budget
before  us  today  could  have  been  worse—but  that  doesn’t  mean  we  just  take  what
we  get  and  passively  make  lemonade  out  of  lemons.  We  cannot  ignore  the  cumu-

This  is  my  second  year  as  Ranking  Member  and  I  come  to  you  today  even  more

I’m  particularly  concerned  that  reports  claim  Dr.  Marburger  called  this  a  ‘‘pretty

Math Education is a ‘‘pretty good year;’’ a six percent decrease in NASA aeronautics;
$320 million dollars less to basic research and a 8.2 percent cut to NOAA research—
even  after  the  tsunami  disaster  the  world  just  witnessed?  That  doesn’t  sound  like
a ‘‘pretty good year’’ to me.

I  wish  that  was  the  end  of  the  list,  but  it  is  only  the  beginning.  NSF  is  over  $5
billions  dollars  behind  the  authorization  level  that  this  Administration  signed  into

has led to many remarkable innovations including PET scans, MRIs, nuclear medi-
cines and cancer therapies.

The  Manufacturing  Extension  Program—probably  the  most  effective  federal  pro-
gram  in  providing  immediate  help  to  U.S.  manufacturers—is—AGAIN—slashed  se-
verely.  The  Advanced  Technology  Program  is—AGAIN—eliminated.  It  makes  no
sense  to  cut  job  creation  programs  when  U.S.  manufacturing  is  losing  tens  of  thou-
sands of jobs to overseas competition.

This was not a pretty good year—not under any circumstances.
The current approach of this Administration is short sighted—it ignores the vital
role  that  research  performed  today  plays  in  our  quality  of  life  and  world  position
tomorrow.  We  can  and  we  must  do  better  to  secure  our  nation’s  future  prosperity.
We  must  redefine  the  discussion.  We  need  to  consider  science  and  technology  re-
search as an investment—not spending.

I’ve said it before and I will say it again now—Maintaining a lead in science and
technology  is  a  flat  out  race.  If  we  stop  running  at  the  top  speed  we  can  manage,
we  will  lose.  Even  in  the  current  fiscal  crisis,  this  budget  is  not  the  top  speed  we
can  manage  for  science  and  technology  investment.  Lack  of  investment  in  innova-
tion and invention now will come home to roost later.

We all understand the need for reasonable cuts and budget realignments, but we
must do so with an eye towards our country’s future. I will work with my colleagues
on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  to  try  to  realign  this  Administration’s  spending  priorities
to  better  meet  our  science  and  technology  needs  and  guard  our  future  fiscal  pros-
perity.

Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you, Mr. Gordon, I think.
You  have  presented  much  that  I  find  myself  in  agreement  with,
but  most  of  the  presentation  was  the  half  empty  side  of  the  glass,
and I tried to concentrate on the half-full side of the glass.

The bottom line is this: whether you are a Democrat or a Repub-
lican,  Chairman  or  a  Ranking  Member,  we  are  committed  to  the
proposition  that  wise  investments  in  science  pay  handsome  divi-
dends for our future. And I know the panelists before us share that
view.  I  also  know  the  panelists  before  us  and  their  departments
have  to  go  through  a  process.  And  we  do  not  consider  the  science
enterprise  in  isolation.  It  is  in  conjunction  with  all  of  the  other
many demands on the budget, particularly during this very difficult
time.

But  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  there  is  widespread  agreement  on
this  on  a  bipartisan  basis  that,  if  anything,  we  need  more  invest-
ment  in  science,  not  because  it  is  under  our  jurisdiction,  although
that  is  important  to  us,  not  because  we  have  an  appreciation  for
these  programs,  which  we  do,  but  because  we  know  it  represents
a  sound  investment  in  our  nation’s  future,  and  we  also  know  that
it is a very competitive world out there, and others are racing when
sometimes it appears that, in certain areas, we are strolling along.
We need to engage in that race, because I want to be first. We are
first now, and I want to retain that premier position.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

Chairman  Boehlert,  I  am  pleased  that  we  are  here  today  to  discuss  one  of  our
most  pressing  of  national  issues,  the  Federal  Government’s  investment  in  science
and technology.

Science  and  technology  are  critical  to  our  economic  prosperity  and  national  secu-
rity.  Economists  have  attributed  much  of  our  nation’s  improvement  in  productivity
in  recent  years  to  the  results  of  research  and  development.  Productivity  improve-
ment  and  technological  breakthroughs  spurred  the  longest  period  of  economic  ex-
pansion  in  our  nation’s  history,  and  they  hold  the  key  for  stimulating  our  economy
now as well as protecting our nation through application of such advancements.

I  understand  that  the  FY  2006  budget  request  represents  the  Administration’s
priorities  of  space  exploration  and  national  defense.  I  am  pleased  to  see  that  the
Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  science  and  technology  budget  is  enhanced  by
more  than  10  percent,  as  well  as  the  Administration’s  substantial  commitment  to
the exploration program at NASA.

I would like to address three parts of the budget request in particular; the Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science,  the  National  Science  Foundation,  and  the  Na-
tional Institute for Standards and Technology.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science  funds  40  percent  of  our  nation’s
physical  science  research.  Research  in  these  areas  has  led  to  many  new  economic
and  medical  advancements  including,  among  others,  new  energy  sources,  the  Inter-
net,  cell  phones  and  laser  surgery.  To  maintain  our  economic,  technical,  and  mili-
tary  preeminence,  the  Federal  Government  must  continue  to  support  research  in
these areas. The FY 2006 budget request for the Office of Science is $3.46 billion—
a  decrease  of  almost  four  percent  from  the  FY  2005  enacted  level.  I  was  dis-
appointed to learn that the plans for the new Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) as well
as the BTev physics facility at the Fermi National Laboratory have been postponed
indefinitely, in light of the lack of funding for these projects. RIA is tied for number
three priority for large facilities ranked by the Department, and is essential for our
country to maintain leadership in nuclear science research.

I’d  also  like  to  specifically  address  the  FY  2006  budget  request  for  the  National
Science Foundation, which is tasked with promoting the progress of science; advanc-
ing  the  national  health,  prosperity,  and  welfare;  and  securing  the  national  defense.
The  NSF  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $5.6  billion  is  a  2.4  percent  increase  over  FY
2005  appropriations;  however,  it  is  $2.9  billion  below  the  authorized  funding  level
necessary  to  complete  the  commitment  Congress  made  to  double  NSF  funding  in
2002. I continue to support this doubling commitment, and I regret that in this aus-
tere budget environment it may not be immediately possible to fulfill this obligation.
NSF  is  the  only  federal  agency  dedicated  solely  to  supporting  basic  scientific  re-
search.  NSF  funding  accounts  for  one-fifth  of  all  federal  support  for  basic  research
and 40 percent of physical science research at academic institutions. Nearly 90 per-
cent of these awards are made through a competitive, merit-review process that en-
sures  that  excellent  and  innovative  research  is  being  supported.  Furthermore,  NSF
consistently  receives  the  highest  rating  from  OMB  for  the  efficiency  and  excellence
of its programs.

NSF  is  also  the  primary  federal  supporter  of  science  and  math  education;  it  un-
derwrites  the  development  of  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and  engineers.  I  am
particularly  concerned  about  the  trend  of  the  current  budget  request  that  reduces
the  Education  and  Human  Resources  budget  at  the  Foundation  by  more  than  $104
million,  or  12  percent.  This  dramatic  decrease  is  unparalleled  in  other  parts  of  the
federal  science  and  technology  portfolio.  Decreasing  awards  in  education,  or  elimi-
nating any new awards entirely, seems very shortsighted when we are currently fac-
ing  the  challenge  of  adequately  preparing  our  students  to  enter  science  and  tech-
nology  fields.  I  have  worked  very  hard  to  maintain  the  Math  and  Science  Partner-
ship program at NSF, where grants are awarded on a peer-reviewed basis that com-
plements  the  strengths  of  a  research-based  organization.  The  FY  2006  request  for
the Math and Science Partnerships of $60 million will only allow continued funding
for  the  programs  that  were  started  in  previous  years,  eliminating  the  future  of  an
incredibly  important  program  to  determine  how  our  students  learn  the  subjects  of
math and science.

Though research grant funding is relatively stable in the FY 2006 budget request,
the grant proposal success rate at NSF continues to decline as the number of appli-
cations  rises.  The  decrease  from  33  percent  of  funded  proposals  in  FY  2000  to  an
estimated 20 percent in FY 2005 contributes to my concern about what type of effect
this may have on innovative, young researchers struggling to maintain their careers
in  such  a  competitive  environment.  As  a  larger  percentage  of  worthy  work  is  not
funded,  I  believe  that  such  an  environment  will  adversely  affect  those  considering
entering  science  and  technology  fields.  Maintaining  a  higher  success  rate  through
reducing  the  number  of  solicitations  or  other  similar  means  is  a  disservice  to  our
national  needs  and  sends  the  wrong  message  to  those  exploring  the  edge  of  science
and technology innovation.

On a more positive note, I am pleased that the President is requesting $426 mil-
lion,  or  a  12  percent  increase,  for  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Tech-
nology (NIST) laboratories. NIST has a proven track record in research and develop-
ment  on  standards  and  measurement  techniques  that  help  U.S.  industries  become
more  globally  competitive  and  retain  leadership  in  cutting-edge  technologies.  I  am
particularly  pleased  that  the  request  includes  $19  million  in  funding  for  an  Ad-
vanced  Manufacturing  research  initiative.  This  initiative  is  aimed  at  speeding  the

development of industrial applications of nanotechnology and streamlining manufac-
turing standards. It will help small and medium-sized manufacturers and has goals
very  similar  to  the  Manufacturing  Technology  Competitiveness  Act  which  I  passed
through the House last Congress.

However, I am very concerned about a different manufacturing program at NIST.
The President’s FY 2006 budget request cuts the Manufacturing Extension Partner-
ship  (MEP)  program  by  over  50  percent  to  $46.8  million.  I  have  worked  very  hard
over  the  years  to  help  my  colleagues  in  Congress  understand  that  MEP  is  vital  to
retaining  American  competitiveness  and  American  jobs,  and  I  believe  they  appre-
ciate  the  value  of  this  program.  Yet  each  budget  cycle  the  Administration  proposes
to  significantly  cut  this  program,  which  the  Department  of  Commerce  itself  recog-
nized as a valuable program in a 2004 report on manufacturing. Diminishing fund-
ing for MEP will devastate small and medium-sized manufacturers and in the long
run severely hurt our competitive edge in the manufacturing sector.

I  am  supportive  of  the  President’s  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $3.5  billion  for  the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While this represents a
nearly $300 million (or eight percent) decrease from the FY 2005 enacted level, the
reduction is from the elimination of congressionally directed projects.

In  summary,  I  cannot  emphasize  enough  that  I  believe  funding  for  science  and
technology  must  be  a  priority  in  the  FY  2006  budget.  While  the  overall  request  for
NSF  is  in  the  right  direction,  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  cuts  to  the  education
programs  and  I  will  continue  to  work  to  highlight  the  importance  of  critical  pro-
grams  like  the  Math  and  Science  Partnerships.  I  am  pleased  with  the  Administra-
tion’s  request  of  $426  million  for  the  NIST  labs  and  pledge  to  work  with  my  col-
leagues to see that request fully funded.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  discuss  the  President’s  FY06  Budget  for  Research  and  Development.  Today’s
hearing serves as an opportunity for oversight of certain departmental programs. As
you are aware, a number of trends spotted in last year’s budget submission are seen
again  in  the  FY06  budget,  including  reversal  of  the  trend  toward  parity  in  defense
and non-defense R&D, an increase in the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration, and targeted cuts towards government-industry programs.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Fossil  Energy  Research  and  Development  programs
make  prudent  investments  in  long-range  research  and  development  that  help  pro-
tect  the  environment  through  higher  efficiency  power  generation,  advanced  tech-
nologies and improved compliance and stewardship operations. These activities safe-
guard our domestic energy security. This country will continue to rely on traditional
fuels for the majority of its energy requirements for the foreseeable future, and the
activities  funded  through  this  account  ensure  that  energy  technologies  continue  to
improve with respect to emissions reductions and control and energy efficiency. The
Fossil Energy Research and Development program impacts my congressional district
because  the  coal  industry  is  of  great  importance  to  the  economy  and  livelihood  of
my  constituents  in  Southern  Illinois.  As  you  may  know,  this  area  is  rich  in  high-
sulfur  coal.  The  shifting  of  production  to  low-sulfur  coal  has  cost  many  of  my  con-
stituents high-paying jobs. Therefore, I am very pleased to learn that coal programs
received  an  overall  increase  of  $13  million  in  this  year’s  budget.  I  have  been  a
strong  advocate  for  developing  technology  that  focuses  on  carbon  sequestration  and
am proud of the $22 million increase it received in the President’s budget. However,
I  would  like  to  see  a  future  increase  of  advanced  research  and  coal-based  fuel  pro-
grams  and  will  work  with  my  Democratic  and  Republican  colleagues  to  accomplish
these goals.

The House report language from last year’s Interior appropriations bill stated that
the  Administration’s  FutureGen  program,  a  zero-emissions  coal  plant,  needs  to  be
justified in future budgets before it can be considered for funding by the Committee.
Therefore, I am extremely pleased the President’s budget again provides $18 million
dollars  for  the  FutureGen  Initiative.  I  urge  the  Committee  and  the  Appropriators
to look favorably on the Administration’s and the Department of Energy’s continued
financial  backing  for  FutureGen.  The  Administration  has  asked  Congress  to  set
aside an additional $257 million to fund the project in 2007 and beyond. I am com-
mitted  to  working  with  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Committee,  and  appropri-
ators from both sides of the aisle to secure funding for FutureGen.

I strongly believe the FutureGen Initiative is a great national investment and Illi-
nois  stands  ready  to  provide  the  resources  and  expertise  needed  to  operate  this

state-of-the-art  coal-fired  power  plant.  I  have  led  the  effort  to  locate  FutureGen  in
Illinois, including a bipartisan effort in the House to secure funding for the project.
In 2003, I hosted a roundtable discussion regarding FutureGen, focusing on the tre-
mendous impact it will have on Illinois, along with Governor Blagojevich, both U.S.
Senators,  and  U.S.  Congressman  John  Shimkus.  Dr.  C.  Lowell  Miller,  Director  of
the Office of Coal Fuels and Industrial Systems at the Department of Energy, made
a  presentation  on  the  specifics  of  the  project.  Recently,  the  Illinois  delegation  sent
a  letter  to  DOE  Secretary  Bodman,  expressing  our  strong  support  for  locating  the
FutureGen  project  in  Southern  Illinois.  Implementing  the  coal  research  program,
which  includes  the  clean  coal  technology  program  and  FutureGen,  is  significant  to
my  state  and  my  district,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  Secretary  Bodman
about the status of the Initiative and the planned spending in this area.

Conversely,  I  am  disappointed  to  see  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)
was  eliminated  from  the  FY06  budget,  nor  provided  any  funds  for  the  orderly  shut
down of the program. Again, the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP) was sig-
nificantly cut in the President’s budget and at this level it is unclear how the MEP
could  function  as  a  national  network.  The  Illinois  Manufacturing  Extension  Center
(IMEC) has worked with over 400 small and mid-sized manufacturers. These compa-
nies  reported  an  average  cost  savings  of  $179,000  with  IMEC’s  assistance.  In  all,
these  manufacturers  reported  more  than  $490  million  in  sales,  cost  savings,  and
productivity. It is difficult to hear that the FY06 budget will leave the MEP Centers
struggling to survive rather than focusing on what they do best: helping businesses
increase efficiency and productivity in order to be competitive in the global market-
place.

Fossil fuels, especially coal, are this country’s most abundant and lowest cost fuels
for electric power generation. They are why this country enjoys the lowest cost elec-
tricity  of  any  industrialized  country.  The  prospects  for  technology  advances  for  coal
and  other  fossil  fuels  are  just  as  promising  as  those  for  alternative  energy  sources,
such  as  solar,  wind,  and  geothermal.  Therefore,  I  am  disappointed  that  most  ac-
counts  under  Renewable  Energy  Resources  would  be  cut  by  11  percent.  Non-fossil
energy sources are extremely important initiatives and I believe we should dedicate
more resources toward these programs.

I welcome our panel of witnesses and look forward to their testimony.
[The prepared statement by Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I greatly appreciate you calling this hearing and I am
especially grateful that our distinguished witnesses have agreed to take time out of
their busy schedules to answer our questions today.

The purpose of this hearing is to provide an opportunity to explore issues affecting

the entire Research and Development (R&D) budget.

I, like many of colleagues, have a lot to say today about the budget we have before
us. The budget includes severe cuts to almost every major government program and
creates  a  deficit  in  2006  that  is  likely  to  top  $400  billion.  This  budget  can  be  cat-
egorized as reckless and irresponsible.

Programs  to  promote  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  would  be  reduced  to  about
$1.2  billion  or  four  percent.  Double-digit  cuts  to  many  programs  in  this  category
were  hidden  by  a  16  percent  increase  to  $260  million  for  a  program  to  develop  hy-
drogen as an efficient fuel source.

The  reductions  prompted  critics  to  question  the  White  House’s  energy  priorities.
In  addition,  this  plan  would  reduce  the  Department’s  extensive  science  and  tech-
nology programs by about four percent, or $3.5 billion, while environmental cleanup
activities  would  be  reduced  by  eight  percent,  to  $6.5  billion.  What  really  disturbs
me about the Department of Energy’s budget is that it assumes $2.4 billion revenue
in oil and gas leasing at the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even though Congress
has never approved a plan opening this land for oil exploration.

The  National  Science  foundation  has  always  been  near  and  dear  to  my  heart.
While  I  am  pleased  to  see  an  increase  in  funding  levels  for  NSF  as  a  whole  will
receive  a  two  percent  increase.  However,  this  increase  cannot  come  at  the  expense
of valuable programs to increase participation by under-represented groups.

The  President’s  budget  calls  for  a  12  percent  reduction  in  funding  for  Math  and
Science  education  programs  (cutting  down  to  $737  million  from  $841  million  in  fis-
cal 2005) These are programs that I have long supported. This reduction leaves hun-
dreds  of  thousands  of  children,  the  majority  of  which  are  in  public  schools,  behind.
The success of the world’s most advanced economy depends on a strong and scientif-
ically literate workforce composed of all races and both genders.

NSF’s  $5.7  billion  budget  authority  is  $3  billion  short  of  the  funding  level  it  was

pledged in 2002, when Congress authorized doubling its budget by 2007.

Members  of  Congress  must  be  fiscally  responsible  when  it  comes  to  making  deci-
sions  about  our  budget  during  these  trying  times.  Our  greatest  responsibility  is  to
leave our children a world that is safer, more prosperous, and more secure.

This  budget  fails  that  test.  It  is  fiscally  irresponsible.  It  is  morally  irresponsible.

And it demonstrates a failure to lead.

[The prepared statement by Mr. Honda follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  thank  you  for  holding  this  im-
portant  hearing  today.  This  is  an  essential  first  step  in  the  oversight  process  it  is
our committee’s responsibility to perform. I emphasize that this is a first step, how-
ever—we  must  be  sure  to  pay  close  attention  to  each  of  the  agencies  represented
here,  both  to  celebrate  their  successes  and  to  make  sure  they  are  doing  the  job  we
expect them to do.

I  am  disappointed  that  the  Federal  Science  and  Technology  (FS&T)  Budget  for
Fiscal  Year  2006  declines  by  1.4  percent  to  $60.8  billion,  and  am  concerned  in  par-
ticular  by  the  significant  decreases  in  the  FS&T  budgets  of  the  Departments  of
Commerce  and  Energy,  which  decline  by  14  percent  and  five  percent,  respectively.
In  a  time  when  we  are  concerned  about  U.S.  competitiveness  in  the  global  market-
place,  it  is  troubling  that  we  are  decreasing  our  investment  in  basic  research  and
development.

There is a troubling theme that runs through the budget requests of each of these
agencies—broken  promises.  The  Congress  and  the  President  made  promises  to  in-
crease  the  budget  of  NSF  and  to  invest  increasing  amounts  in  nanotechnology,  but
these  budget  requests  do  not  reflect  those  promises.  And  while  the  budget  delivers
on  some  promises  made  to  develop  facilities  at  the  DOE  national  laboratories,  by
reducing the amount of funding for research it ensures that those facilities will not
be used to their maximum benefit.

I  am  also  disturbed  by  the  funding  cut  planned  for  the  Manufacturing  Extension
Program  and  the  complete  elimination  of  the  Advanced  Technology  Program.  A  60
percent  cut  for  MEP  produces  a  situation  in  which  it  is  unclear  how  the  program
can continue to function as a national network. At a time when we are losing manu-
facturing  jobs  to  overseas  competitors,  it  is  essential  that  we  help  out  our  domestic
manufacturers as much as we can.

The  zeroing  out  of  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  is  particularly  egregious,
since the budget request does not even provide the funds that will needed to execute
the  termination  of  the  program,  should  Congress  go  along  with  such  a  proposition.
The  funds  will  need  to  be  ‘‘found’’  somewhere  else,  and  the  most  likely  target  are
the labs of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which could end up
losing a much needed budget increase to close out ATP.

There are many questions that must be answered about this budget request, and

I hope the witnesses will provide us with those answers today.
[The prepared statement by Mr. Davis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LINCOLN DAVIS

Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
While I appreciate all of our witnesses today, I want to focus on the budget prior-

ities for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

The Office of Science budget shapes the priorities and direction of physical science
and  energy  research  in  our  prestigious  national  laboratories.  Laboratories  such  as
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, near my District, are dependent on that budget
to survive and build upon years of energy research that has resulted in greater en-
ergy efficiency and cleaner-burning fuels.

Scientists all over the country use our national laboratories to conduct important
research  that  benefits  our  nation  and  the  world.  I  hope  that  the  Office  of  Science
will re-think parts of its budget plan to show greater support for research and facili-
ties at the national laboratories.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for hosting this hearing and
working  diligently  to  encourage  this  impressive  panel  to  sit  before  us  today.  Mem-
bers  of  the  panel,  I  am  pleased  that  all  of  you  have  decided  to  accept  the  Commit-
tee’s invitation to appear and I look forward to hearing your testimony.

It is clear the research and development portions of the budget have been hit hard
by  administration  cuts.  Even  the  hearing  charter  written  by  the  majority  suggests
that  cuts  could  significantly  impact  U.S.  leadership  in  science  and  technology  and
on  the  production  of  future  scientists  and  engineers.  If  our  nation’s  impressive
standing  in  science  slips,  we  will  risk  our  national  security—we  cannot  sit  idly  by
and let this happen.

Mr. Kassinger, on a more specific note, I believe that slashing the successful Man-
ufacturing  Extension  Partnership  Program  (MEP)  by  an  egregious  56.5  percent
should be reevaluated. I understand the tight budgetary constraints that face us in
these  difficult  times,  but  I  hesitate  to  nearly  abolish  the  only  program  available  to
aid  small  local  manufacturers.  The  network  of  extension  centers  and  field  offices
that  offer  small  local  manufacturers  process  improvements,  worker  training,  busi-
ness practices, and information technology applications is unavailable elsewhere.

In  my  home  State  of  Missouri,  our  MEP  program  is  called  the  Missouri  Enter-
prise.  It  has  nine  field  offices,  and  has  created  or  retained  2,449  jobs  and
$279,320,000  in  2003.  The  work  that  Missouri  Enterprise  and  all  MEPs  is  signifi-
cant  and  I  believe  worth  the  expense.  Please  work  to  preserve  this  important  pro-
gram.

[The prepared statement by Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  hearing  to  discuss  the  federal
research  and  development  budget  for  the  2006  fiscal  year.  Clearly,  you  have  com-
piled an impressive panel of witnesses from some of the top agencies affected by this
budget.  Let  me  take  a  moment  to  recognize  Dr.  Samuel  Bodman  and  congratulate
him on recently being unanimously confirmed by the Senate and being sworn in as
the  11th  Secretary  of  Energy  earlier  this  month.  The  five  panelists  here  represent
some  of  the  brightest  and  hard  working  minds  in  America  and  I  look  forward  to
working with all of them in the future to improve our nation’s scientific and techno-
logical capabilities.

Unfortunately, while I wholeheartedly support the work of the science community,
I  do  not  believe  the  President’s  budget  for  R&D  meets  all  the  needs  of  our  nation
to  move  forward  in  this  new  century.  This  Administration’s  budget  continues  the
same  bad  choices  that  have  led  to  huge  deficits  and  mounting  debt  during  the  last
four  years.  For  the  third  year  in  a  row,  the  Administration’s  budget  sets  a  record
deficit, and offers no real plan to put the budget in balance. In addition to the debt
it  has  accumulated,  the  Bush  Administration  proposes  $1.6  trillion  in  tax  cuts  and
a  plan  for  Social  Security  privatization  that  can  only  drive  the  deficit  up.  In  order
to  pay  for  small  portions  of  these  plans,  the  Administration  plans  to  cut  services
for  veterans,  students,  small  businesses,  law  enforcement,  health,  urban  and  rural
development,  and  environmental  protection.  Sadly,  the  R&D  budget  is  not  immune
from these cuts and vital programs to improve the lives of Americans are left to suf-
fer.

However, the most troubling aspect of the President’s budget is that it continually
omits  costs  and  provides  incomplete  data,  obscuring  the  full  extent  of  the  damage
done  by  its  policies.  This  budget  fails  to  factor  in  the  cost  of  the  President’s  Social
Security Privatization plan which will cost the American taxpayer $754 billion from
2009–2015. The cost to repair the Alternative Minimum Tax will be as high as $774
billion,  none  of  which  is  included  in  the  budget.  Perhaps  the  most  flagrant  abuse
in  the  President’s  budget  is  that  it  does  not  include  the  realistic  costs  for  Iraq  and
Afghanistan,  which  based  on  a  CBO  analysis,  will  be  as  much  as  $384  billion  over
ten  years.  Sadly,  the  budget  for  R&D  continues  the  use  of  this  fuzzy  math  through
the selective use of earmarks. When it suits the Administration to count earmarks,
such  as  when  calculating  budget  increases  from  2001–2005,  they  do  so.  When  it
doesn’t suit them to count earmarks, such as when claiming that one of their budget
cuts  isn’t  a  real  cut  when  the  earmarks  are  left  off,  they  don’t.  These  kinds  of  mis-
leading  budget  tricks  are  not  only  wrong,  but  they  are  in  fact  immoral.  This  is  the
American  taxpayers  money  we  are  talking  about  here  and  whether  we  are  talking

about  the  federal  budget  as  a  whole,  or  just  the  R&D  budget,  the  American  people
deserve  to  have  a  fair  and  accurate  portrayal  of  where  there  tax  dollars  are  going.
I am disappointed to find that the President’s budget proposal will cut the science
funding  for  R&D.  The  so-called  increase  in  funding  is  actually  merely  0.56  percent,
which  in  fact  is  less  than  the  two  percent  expected  rate  of  inflation.  So  in  real
spending  power,  the  federal  R&D  funding  would  decline.  In  addition,  nearly  all  of
this meager increase is targeted for weapons development. If you eliminate weapons
development  from  the  equation,  the  federal  research  investment  decreases  by  1.4
percent  in  the  President’s  request.  Government-wide  funding  for  basic  research
would  decrease  by  1.2  percent  and  funding  for  applied  research  would  decrease  by
$3  million.  Furthermore,  these  numbers  do  not  take  into  account  the  two  percent
expected  rate  of  inflation;  so  in  its  actual  application  the  cuts  are  steeper  than  the
numbers would indicate.

I am also appalled by the Administration’s effort to basically destroy the Manufac-
turing  Extension  Program  (MEP)  and  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)  in
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  budget.  The  MEP  is  a
successful  federal/State  partnership  designed  to  assist  small  manufacturers  retain
their  competitive  edge.  The  Administration’s  request  of  $46.8  million  is  less  than
one-half  of  what  is  required  to  maintain  a  fully  operational  national  network  of
MEP Centers. MEP helps smaller manufacturers take advantage of the latest tech-
nology.  Similarly,  the  ATP  provides  grants  to  companies  for  pre-competitive  re-
search; this program is now being completely eliminated from the Bush Administra-
tion  budget.  This  is  no  way  to  help  the  crisis  we  face  in  the  great  loss  of  manufac-
turing  jobs  in  this  nation.  In  my  State  of  Texas  alone,  we  have  lost  188,000  manu-
facturing jobs since the beginning of the Bush Administration. In spite of these tre-
mendous  job  losses,  this  Administration  chooses  to  basically  eliminate  two  success-
ful technology programs and I find that kind of fiscal mismanagement to be inexcus-
able.

I  am  also  greatly  disappointed  to  find  that  promises  made  regarding  funding  for
NSF have been broken once again. Three years ago, the President signed an author-
ization  bill  doubling  NSF  funding  over  five  years.  Unfortunately,  the  requests  for
NSF since the signing ceremony have been lackluster at best, as they would produce
a  doubling  of  funding  in  about  25  years.  As  a  result  of  these  deficient  funds  NSF
is  $5.8  billion  behind  its  target.  The  balance  between  the  physical  sciences  and
health  sciences  remains  highly  skewed.  In  2002,  this  Administration  signed  a  bill
to  correct  that  imbalance  but  the  Administration  has  failed  to  follow  through  on
that obligation. It’s sad to think that so many promises made by this Administration
are broken in this highly flawed budget proposal.

The fact that this Administration has decided to cut $1.3 million for cyber security
funding  under  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  is  appalling  to  me.  Cyber
threats to our nation will only continue to grow as time goes on and as technologies
become  available.  Cyber  security  is  an  area  where  the  Federal  Government  must
stay  one  step  ahead  of  those  who  hope  to  threaten  our  nation.  Cyber  security  is  so
urgent because terrorists or other criminals can attack our technological infrastruc-
ture  from  thousands  of  miles  away  and  can  be  nearly  untraceable  to  authorities.
The United States should be at the forefront of cyber security in the world and that
requires an increase in funding, not the decrease we see here.

Despite the great deals of flaws in the President’s budget and the lack of funding
I  see  for  R&D,  I  remain  hopeful.  I  remain  hopeful  because  we  still  have  many  tre-
mendous  R&D  programs  that  can  impact  the  lives  of  the  American  people  in  so
many  different  ways.  I  look  forward  to  seeing  our  scientific  community  continue  to
make  advances  and  improve  upon  our  technological  infrastructure.  So,  I  look  for-
ward  to  hearing  from  our  distinguished  panel  about  how  their  agencies  can  accom-
plish these lofty standards.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  with  that,  let  me  thank  all  of  the  very
distinguished witnesses. Secretary Bodman has been on the job two
weeks,  and  he  has  been  testifying  for  three  weeks,  so  how  do  you
figure that one? And Dr. Marburger, we are in regular consultation
with  you,  and  I  thank  you  so  much  for  the  fine  job  you  do  for  the
President  and  the  country.  And  Mr.  Kassinger,  it  is  good  to  have
you  back.  And  Dr.  Bement,  you  know  I  am  an  unabashed  cheer-
leader  for  the  agency  that  you  represent.  And  Dr.  McQueary,  we
created  your  job  and  the  whole  notion  that  there  should  be  some-
one  like  you  in  a  very  sensitive  position  within  the  Department  of
Homeland Security. And I am so pleased to have you.

So  we  have  before  us,  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  this  committee,
some of the Nation’s finest public servants. They are trying to deal
with  a  very  difficult  budget  scenario,  and  if  the  truth  be  known,  I
can  guarantee  you  each  of  our  witnesses  would  come  up  with  a
wish list that would contain a lot more than they got. But we have
got  to  deal  with  what  is  requested,  and  then  we  will  do  our  level
best to assist in getting more in the right areas.

With  that,  let  me  introduce  the  panel:  Dr.  John  Marburger,  Di-
rector of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, affectionately
known  as  the  Science  Advisor  to  the  President;  Dr.  Samuel  W.
Bodman,  the  newly-installed  Secretary  of  Energy;  Dr.  Arden
Bement,  Director,  National  Science  Foundation;  Mr.  Theodore  W.
Kassinger,  Deputy  Secretary  of  Commerce;  and  Dr.  Charles  E.
McQueary,  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology,  Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.

You know the drill. You are experts. We would ask you to try to
confine  your  opening  statement  to  five  or  six  minutes.  I  am  not
going to be arbitrary. It is too darn important what you are talking
about,  and  you  are  the  only  panel.  But  keep  in  mind,  the  less  you
speak  in  your  formal  presentation,  the  more  opportunity  we  have
for a good, healthy exchange. And we both might benefit from that.

With that, Dr. Marburger.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOHN  H.  MARBURGER,  III,  PRESIDENT’S
SCIENCE  ADVISER;  DIRECTOR,  OFFICE  OF  SCIENCE  AND
TECHNOLOGY POLICY
Dr.  MARBURGER.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  and  Ranking
Member  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  pleased  to
appear before you once again to discuss the President’s R&D budg-
et for fiscal year 2006.

As you know and have said in your opening remarks, despite the
exceptional  pressure  on  this  budget,  it  does  propose  an  increase  in
federal  R&D  funds.  The  budget  maintains  a  strong  focus  on  win-
ning  the  war  against  terrorism  while  moderating  the  growth  in
overall  spending.  And  this  focus  is  reflected  in  the  proposed  R&D
investments.

The  Administration  has  made  difficult  choices,  and  it  has  main-
tained the strength in priority areas, such as nanotechnology, infor-
mation  technology,  the  hydrogen  initiative,  and  space  exploration.
Furthermore,  while  overall  non-security  discretionary  spending  is
reduced  by  one  percent,  non-security  R&D  is  not  correspondingly
diminished. The fiscal year 2006 proposal preserves the substantial
increases  made,  and  I  might  add,  with  your  support,  Mr.  Chair-
man, and that of your committee, during the first term of this Ad-
ministration.

My  written  testimony  does  summarize  the  extraordinary  growth
of R&D funding during the past four years, and it is from that pla-
teau of excellence that we view this budget proposal.

This budget requests $132.3 billion for federal R&D, an increase
of  $733  million  over  the  current  year’s  record  R&D  budget.  The
budget allocates 13.6 percent of total discretionary outlays to R&D,
the  highest  level  in  37  years.  Non-defense  R&D  accounts  for  5.6
percent  of  the  total  discretionary  outlays,  an  amount  significantly
greater  than  the  five  percent  average  over  the  past  three  decades.

In  my  oral  testimony,  I  will  just  briefly  highlight  the  agency
budgets,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  describe  the  priorities  that  shape
them.  And  my  colleagues  on  the  panel  have  much  more  to  say
about the details for their agencies, as you know, so let me simply
begin with the Department of Defense.

The  fiscal  year  2006  request  is  more  than  $70  billion,  of  which
$5.5  billion  is  for  DOD  basic  and  applied  research.  This  is  $900
million less than the fiscal year 2005 enacted level in this category,
but it is greater than the fiscal year 2005 enacted level minus Con-
gressional earmarks, which are over a billion dollars for this agen-
cy, and $250 million more than the fiscal year 2005 presidential re-
quest.

And  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  express  my  concern
briefly  that  investments  in  defense  R&D  are  discounted  by  some
science budget commentators as somehow less important than non-
defense  science.  That  is  wrong.  National  security  related  science
and  technology  drive  innovation  and  strengthen  economic  competi-
tiveness  in  much  the  same  way  as  technical  work  for  other  pur-
poses.  The  technology  required  for  national  and  homeland  security
is  nearly  always  dual  use  and  benefits  civilian  as  well  as  military
products.

Let me move on to homeland security.
Science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security
will increase from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, including $227 million
to fund the creation of an important new Domestic Nuclear Defense
Office, DNDO.

At  NIH,  the  fiscal  year  2006  request  is  $28.8  billion  for  bio-
medical research, a $196 million increase from fiscal year 2005 en-
acted.

In  NSF,  NSF’s  budget,  as  you  noted,  Mr.  Chairman,  would  in-
crease  by  2.4  percent  to  $5.6  billion  in  fiscal  year  2006.  Invest-
ments in this key science agency strengthen U.S. science across the
board and play an exceptionally important role in America’s unique
system of university-based science and engineering research.

The Department of Energy Office of Science: this budget provides
$3.5  billion  for  DOE’s  Office  of  Science,  a  $57  million  reduction
after  removing  $80  million  in  earmarks.  This  reduction  does  not
imply  diminished  priority  for  Office  of  Science  operations,  but  re-
flects  various  construction  and  procurement  adjustments.  Over  a
five-year  period,  this  Administration  has  invested  more  than  $17
billion  in  the  Office  of  Science  basic  research  at  DOE,  which  is  14
percent  greater  than  the  previous  five-year  period  in  constant  dol-
lars.

NASA:  the  request  for  NASA  is  $16.46  billion,  a  2.4  percent  in-
crease  from  2005,  reflecting  a  strong  commitment  by  the  Adminis-
tration  to  the  missions  of  this  agency.  The  fiscal  year  2006  budget
request also makes some hard decisions in NASA, trading off some
products with high technical risks to maintain others with high sci-
entific  value.  And  I  know  you  will  hear  more  about  that  in  your
hearing.

The Department of Commerce: the 2006 budget provides over $1
billion  for  R&D  at  the  Department  of  Commerce,  including  $361
million  for  oceanic  and  atmospheric  research  at  NOAA,  an  11  per-
cent reduction due mostly to the effect of earmarks and an increase

35

of eight percent in NIST’s core programs, which actually translates
to 22 percent after earmarks are excluded.

In  EPA,  the  2006  S&T  request,  science  and  technology  request,
is  $792  million,  a  two  percent  increase  over  fiscal  year  2005  even
before removing $70 million in earmarks.

The  Department  of  Transportation,  and  this  is  the  last  agency  I
will  mention  specifically,  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  for
highway-related  research  is  $543  million,  $23  million  less  than
2005 before removing significant earmarks.

Mr.  Chairman,  you  mentioned  interagency  initiatives,  among
them  the  Networking  and  Information  Technology  R&D  program.
With  President  Bush’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  of  $2.2  bil-
lion  for  this  program,  the  investment  in  this  area  over  five  years
will total more than $10.4 billion.

The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative:  the  President’s  budget
provides for over $1 billion for this multi-agency initiative, bringing
the total investment under this Administration to $4.7 billion.

Climate  change:  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  proposes  approxi-
mately  $1.9  billion  to  fund  the  Climate  Change  Science  Program,
which  is  virtually  the  same  as  2005  despite  reductions  in  NASA
due to reprioritization of programs. With this request, the Adminis-
tration  will  have  invested  more  than  $9  billion  over  five  years  to
improve our understanding of the global climate system.

The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative receives $260 million, a 16 percent
increase  from  2005.  The  initiative  remains  on  track  to  meet  Presi-
dent  Bush’s  five-year,  $1.2  billion  commitment  to  hydrogen  re-
search and development announced in his 2003 State of the Union
address.

And  finally,  in  homeland  security,  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  funding  will  increase
from  $1.1  billion  to  $1.4  billion.  R&D  is  focused  on  countering
chemical,  biological,  radiological,  nuclear,  and  other  catastrophic
threats.  I  mention  DHS  again  in  this  context  of  interagency  co-
operation, because many agencies contribute to our domestic safety.
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, America’s science
and technology capabilities are the envy of the world. I believe the
President’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  proposal  maintains  and  selec-
tively strengthens these capabilities in areas that are important to
the  Nation’s  national  homeland  and  economic  security,  and  I  look
forward to responding and answering your questions.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Marburger follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN H. MARBURGER, III

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Minority Member Gordon, and Members of the Com-
mittee,  I  am  pleased  to  appear  before  you  once  again  to  discuss  the  President’s  re-
search and development (R&D) budget. As I have said many times before, I greatly
appreciate the effective working relationship between our office and your committee,
which  I  believe  has  resulted  in  good  outcomes  for  the  Nation’s  science  and  tech-
nology enterprise.

The  budget  this  year  is  subject  to  considerable  pressure,  as  you  know,  and  the
President  is  committed  to  cutting  the  budget  deficit  in  half  by  2009.  These  factors
make this year’s budget proposal the tightest in nearly two decades.

Despite these pressures, federal R&D funds will increase in the President’s fiscal
year  (FY)  2006  budget.  The  Budget  maintains  a  strong  focus  on  winning  the  war
against  terrorism,  while  moderating  the  growth  in  overall  spending,  and  this  focus
is  reflected  in  the  proposed  R&D  investments.  The  Administration  has  also  main-
tained high levels of support for priority areas such as nanotechnology, information

technology, the hydrogen initiative, and space exploration. Furthermore, while over-
all  ‘‘non-security’’  discretionary  spending  is  reduced  by  one  percent,  ‘‘non-security’’
R&D  is  not  correspondingly  diminished.  The  FY06  proposal  preserves  the  substan-
tial  increases  made—with  your  support—during  the  first  term  of  this  Administra-
tion.  This  treatment  of  R&D  is  consistent  with  the  President’s  commitment  to
science  and  technology  and  the  vital  role  they  play  in  meeting  the  Nation’s  goals
for national and economic security and the quality of life.

Comparing  R&D  investments  in  this  Administration  with  investments  in  other
top national priorities demonstrates this commitment: From FY01 to this FY06 pro-
posal, federal spending on Department of Homeland Security activities will have in-
creased  83  percent;  Department  of  Education  programs  are  up  40  percent;  and  De-
partment  of  Defense  spending  is  up  37  percent.  At  the  same  time  total  federal  in-
vestment  in  R&D  will  have  increased  45  percent.  The  percentage  increase  in  R&D
has been second only to the increase in the Department of Homeland Security dur-
ing  President  Bush’s  first  five  budget  years  (and  I  might  add,  during  Chairman
Boehlert’s five years as Chairman of this committee).

This  historic  increase  in  R&D  has  not  been  confined  to  a  single  agency  or  field
of  science.  It  does  include  a  significant  investment  in  defense  R&D,  whose  value  to
the  Nation’s  technical  enterprise  extends  well  beyond  the  defense  establishment.
Defense  R&D  funds  significant  university  and  private  sector  research,  supports  a
large  number  of  scientists,  engineers  and  technical  experts,  and  is  instrumental  in
training  and  recruiting  the  next  generation  of  technical  talent  for  the  Nation.  Non-
defense  R&D,  however,  has  also  benefited  from  similar  large  increases  during  the
past five years.

I am emphasizing these historical data to provide a context for this year’s request.
Within  a  pattern  of  overall  budget  constraint,  funds  are  provided  that  we  believe
are  appropriate  to  maintain  and  refine  the  large  program  increases  of  previous
years.  Within  the  pattern  of  detailed  agency  budgets,  priorities  have  been  estab-
lished  and  choices  made  that  preserve  the  Nation’s  investment  in  the  critically  im-
portant assets of science and technology.
THE PRESIDENT’S FY 2006 R&D BUDGET

The  President’s  FY  2006  Budget  requests  $132.3  billion  in  Federal  Research  and
Development  funds,  an  increase  of  $733  million  over  this  year’s  (2005)  record  R&D
budget.  The  Budget  allocates  13.6  percent  of  total  discretionary  outlays  to  R&D—
the highest level in 37 years. Non-defense R&D accounts for 5.6 percent of total dis-
cretionary  outlays,  an  amount  significantly  greater  than  the  5.0  percent  average
over the past three decades.

While non-defense discretionary program budget authority is reduced by 0.26 per-
cent  in  this  proposal,  non-defense  R&D  funds  are  increased  by  0.74  percent.  The
category of Basic Research is maintained near its historically high level at $26.6 bil-
lion in FY 2006, slightly down from $26.9 billion in FY 2005.

Not all programs can or should receive equal priority, and this budget reflects pri-
ority  choices  consistent  with  recommendations  from  numerous  expert  sources.  In
particular, this budget is informed by recommendations from the President’s Council
of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology  (PCAST),  and  reflects  an  extensive  process
of  consultation  among  the  federal  agencies,  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget
(OMB), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).

As  in  previous  years  this  R&D  budget  highlights  collaborations  among  multiple
federal  agencies  working  together  on  broad  themes.  I  will  describe  some  individual
agency  highlights,  followed  by  the  five  multi-agency  R&D  priorities  highlighted  in
the President’s FY 2006 Budget: Networking and Information Technology R&D; Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Initiative;  Climate  Change  Science  Program;  Hydrogen  Fuel
Initiative; and Homeland Security R&D.
AGENCY BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS
Department of Defense (DOD):

DOD’s  FY  2006  R&D  budget  is  over  $70  billion.  These  funds  will  help  to  trans-
form our nation’s military capabilities to meet future threats and to fight the Global
War  on  Terror.  They  also  will  improve  DOD’s  capabilities  against  weapons  of  mass
destruction,  including  new  laboratory  facilities,  detection  systems,  and  protective
measures  against  advanced  biological  and  chemical  weapons.  From  FY  2006  to  FY
2011,  $764  million  is  budgeted  to  upgrade  infrastructure  at  the  U.S.  Army  Medical
Research  Institute  of  Infectious  Disease  (USAMRIID),  a  critical  component  of  this
nation’s  federal  biodefense  effort.  USAMRIID  not  only  works  to  protect  men  and
women  in  uniform,  it  also  responds  to  emerging  infectious  diseases  that  threaten
our nation (i.e., SARS, West Nile, Hantavirus and Ebola).

I want to take this opportunity to express my concern that investments in defense
R&D  are  often  discounted  by  science  budget  observers  as  somehow  less  important
than  non-defense  science.  That  is  a  serious  misconception.  Weapons  systems  devel-
opment  and  other  national  security-related  discovery  and  technology  creation  drive
innovation and strengthen economic competitiveness in much the same way as tech-
nical  work  for  other  purposes.  The  technology  required  for  national  and  homeland
security  is  nearly  always  ‘‘dual  use’’  and  benefits  civilian  as  well  as  military  prod-
ucts.

Because  science,  mathematics,  and  engineering  (SME)  are  vital  disciplines  to  our
national  defense,  a  formal  DOD  Science,  Mathematics  and  Research  for  Trans-
formation (SMART) Defense Scholarship Pilot Program was established in FY 2005.
The purpose is to promote the education, recruitment and retention of U.S. citizens
in SME studies deemed critical to national defense. DOD also uses other scholarship
and  fellowship  programs  (i.e.,  the  National  Defense  Science  and  Engineering  Grad-
uate  (NDSEG)  fellowship  program)  to  sponsor  graduate  students.  Funding  for
NDSEG has increased to support 200 new students annually by FY 2007.

A total of $5.5 billion is provided for DOD basic and applied research. This is $905
million  less  than  the  FY  2005  enacted  level  in  this  category,  but  greater  than  the
FY  2005  enacted  level  minus  Congressional  earmarks  (over  $1  billion)—and  $250
million  more  than  the  FY  2005  request.  This  budget  request  does  not  continue  FY
2005 earmarks beyond FY 2005, instead increasing programs of priority to military
leaders.  Earmarks  are  not  consistent  with  using  funds  most  efficiently  to  target
military priorities or to support the best research for military purposes. The Admin-
istration  is  prepared  to  work  with  Congress  to  achieve  consistency  in  Legislative
and  Executive  priorities  to  fund  the  best  scientific  research  possible  to  support  our
military forces.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS):

DHS-wide  funding  for  science  and  technology  (including  TSA,  Coast  Guard  and
Secret  Service)  will  increase  from  $1.2  billion  to  $1.5  billion  (FY  2005  to  FY  2006).
Within  that  total,  DHS  Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  Directorate  funding  will  in-
crease  from  $1.1  billion  to  $1.4  billion  (FY  2005  to  FY  2006).  R&D  is  focused  on
countering chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and other catastrophic threats.
The President is requesting $227 million in DHS to fund the creation of a Domes-
tic  Nuclear  Defense  Office  (DNDO)  whose  responsibility  will  be  to  develop  a  com-
prehensive  system  to  detect  and  mitigate  any  attempt  to  import  or  transport  a  nu-
clear  explosive  device,  fissile  material,  or  radiological  material  intended  for  use
within the U.S. The DNDO will enhance and coordinate the nuclear detection efforts
of Federal, State and local governments and the private sector to ensure a managed,
coordinated response. At the federal level, the DNDO will draw representatives from
agencies  involved  with  nuclear  defense  research.  They  will  analyze  current  nuclear
defense R&D investments and create a prioritized road map of future research that
will  address  current  gaps  and  deficiencies.  This  will  allow  for  the  development  of
a coordinated plan, while at the same time ensuring that critical gaps are addressed
and  redundancies  avoided,  and  maintaining  the  integrity  of  each  agency’s  current
unique missions.

The S&T Directorate is leading the Administration effort to develop new counter-
measures  to  protect  civilian  and  commercial  aircraft  against  man  portable  air  de-
fense  systems  (MANPADS).  In  the  2006  Budget,  the  President  has  requested  $110
million  to  continue  DHS’s  Counter–MANPADS  program.  This  $49  million  increase
over last year’s budget will go to funding phase II of the program in which systems
developed  by  BAE  Systems  and  Northrup  Grumman  will  undergo  rigorous  testing
and evaluation.

The University Programs Office within the S&T Directorate has established three
Homeland  Security  Centers  of  Excellence  (Texas  A&M,  USC,  and  the  University  of
Minnesota)  and  has  just  awarded  a  grant  to  the  University  of  Maryland  to  become
the  fourth  Center  of  Excellence.  This  program  will  continue  to  operate  and  expand
to seven Centers with a requested FY 2006 budget of $63.6 million, which is 90 per-
cent  of  the  current  year  budget.  The  fellowship  program  will  continue  at  the  FY
2005 level.
National Institutes of Health (NIH):

Following fulfillment of the President’s commitment to complete the five-year dou-
bling  of  the  agency’s  budget,  the  FY  2006  request  is  $28.8  billion,  a  $196  million
increase  from  FY  2005  enacted.  The  recent  budget  doubling  changes  the  scale  of
NIH  operations  and  requires  new  management  mechanisms  to  better  integrate,  co-
ordinate  and  focus  research,  especially  interdisciplinary  research,  across  NIH’s  27
Institutes and Centers (ICs).

Since  2001,  the  NIH  Budget  has  increased  by  $8.2  billion  or  40  percent.  NIH  is
committing  $333  million  towards  Roadmap  initiatives,  an  increase  of  $98  million
over  the  FY  2005  enacted  level.  The  Roadmap  is  a  part  of  the  total  NIH  budget,
and  is  important  as  a  means  to  optimize  the  effectiveness  of  the  entire  research
portfolio,  focusing  on  efforts  that  no  single  or  small  group  of  ICs  could  address.
Roadmap  initiatives  will  provide  the  tools  to  transform  the  content  and  process  of
medical research over the next decade.

Other highlights include $2.9 billion for AIDS research, including the highest pri-
ority goal of development of an AIDS vaccine, and almost $1.8 billion for Biodefense
research  and  development  activities.  In  addition,  NIH  has  recently  issued  an  in-
terim final rule changing the way employee conflict of interest is regulated. We be-
lieve  this  action  will  greatly  increase  public  confidence  in  the  integrity  of  the  NIH
intramural  research  program.  NIH  also  has  proposed  an  NIH  Public  Access  Policy,
which provides the public with better access to research publications resulting from
NIH-funded research. This is accomplished by establishing a comprehensive, search-
able electronic archive of NIH-funded research publications, providing publicly avail-
able access to all.
National Science Foundation (NSF):

Funds are requested to increase the budget for NSF by 2.4 percent to $5.6 billion
in  FY  2006,  26  percent  above  2001’s  $4.4  billion  level.  Similar  investments  in  the
past have yielded important scientific discoveries, which boost economic growth and
enhance Americans’ quality of life.

NSF leads two Administration priority research areas that promise to strengthen
the  Nation’s  economy:  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  and  the  Net-
working  and  Information  Technology  R&D  program 
(NITRD).  NSF-funded
nanotechnology  research,  proposed  at  $344  million  in  FY  2006,  a  1.6  percent  in-
crease  over  2005  and  129  percent  since  2001,  has  advanced  our  understanding  of
materials  at  the  molecular  level  and  has  provided  insights  into  how  innovative
mechanisms and tools can be built atom by atom. This emerging field holds promise
for  a  broad  range  of  developing  technologies,  including  higher-performance  mate-
rials, more efficient manufacturing processes, higher-capacity computer storage, and
microscopic biomedical instruments and mechanisms. NSF’s investments in NITRD,
funded  at  $803  million  in  2006,  a  one-percent  increase  over  2005  and  26  percent
since  2001,  support  all  major  areas  of  basic  information  technology  (IT)  research.
NSF  also  incorporates  IT  advances  into  its  scientific  and  engineering  applications,
supports  using  computing  and  networking  infrastructure  for  research,  and  contrib-
utes to IT-related education for scientists, engineers, and the IT workforce.

Growing concerns about the vulnerability of computers, networks and information
systems have prompted increased NSF investments in cyber security research, edu-
cation  and  training.  The  FY  2006  Budget  provides  $94  million  for  these  activities.
Every  research  discipline  in  the  agency  is  increased  between  one  to  3.5  percent,
allowing  the  grant  funding  rate  to  be  restored  to  21  percent  (from  20  percent  in
2005).  Funding  is  provided  for  the  five  Major  Research  Equipment  (MRE)  projects
already  approved  (Atacama  Large  Millimeter  Array,  EarthScope,  the  IceCube  Neu-
trino  Observatory,  the  Rare  Symmetry  Violating  Processes  (RSVP)  installation,  the
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and the Scientific Ocean Drilling
Vessel).

In order to most effectively and efficiently support the Nation’s polar research ac-
tivities  in  Antarctica,  funding  for  three  polar  icebreakers  is  being  transferred  from
the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  to  NSF  ($48  million).  In  the  future,  this  will  permit  NSF  to
define  the  options  for  refurbishment  or  replacement  of  two  of  the  ships,  as  well  as
operational options for the third (Arctic) icebreaker.

The  FY  2006  Budget  will  continue  NSF’s  efforts  to  prepare  U.S.  students  for  the
science  and  engineering  workforce,  with  funds  for  4,600  graduate  research  fellow-
ships and traineeships. NSF provides annual stipends in these programs of $30,000,
which is significantly higher than the average stipend of $18,000 in 2001.
Department of Energy (DOE):

The  FY  2006  Budget  provides  $3.5  billion  for  DOE’s  Office  of  Science,  a  $57  mil-
lion  reduction  after  removing  $80  million  in  earmarks.  This  reduction  does  not
imply  diminished  priority  for  Office  of  Science  operations,  but  reflects  various  con-
struction and procurement adjustments. Over a five year period this Administration
has  invested  more  than  $17  billion  in  Office  of  Science  basic  research  at  DOE,  14
percent greater than the previous five-year period in constant dollars.

The  Department  has  a  broad  program  of  basic  research  and  operates  a  unique
suite of major scientific user facilities in support of its missions. The FY 2006 Budg-
et  provides  funding  to  complete  construction  and  begin  operation  of  the  Spallation

Neutron  Source—to  become  the  world’s  preeminent  facility  for  materials  studies—
and four new nanoscale science research centers. $25 million is included for the de-
velopment  of  a  High-end  Computing  (HEC)  Leadership  Class  Computer,  bringing
the  total  three-year  investment  to  $100  million.  $83  million  begins  construction  of
the  Linac  Coherent  Light  Source—a  revolutionary  new  facility  that  will  open  en-
tirely  new  realms  of  discovery  in  the  chemical,  materials,  and  biological  sciences.
Basic  materials  and  chemistry  research  in  support  of  the  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative
is enhanced to $33 million and assuming that international partners reach a timely
site  decision,  $46  million  is  available  to  begin  fabrication  of  U.S.  contributions  to
the  International  Thermonuclear  Experimental  Reactor  (ITER).  These  investments
will allow U.S. scientists to remain at the forefront of their fields.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA):

During  the  year  since  the  President  outlined  a  bold  vision  for  sustained  and  af-
fordable human and robotic exploration of space, NASA has restructured its organi-
zation  and  reprioritized  its  programs.  The  current  human  spaceflight  programs,
Shuttle  and  International  Space  Station,  are  focusing  research  and  technology  de-
velopment  on  enabling  the  vision,  while  requirements  are  being  established  for  the
next generation of space transportation. An exciting array of space science missions
are  being  planned  that  will  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  solar  system,  includ-
ing interactions between the Earth and the space environment, and building observ-
atories  that  will  peer  further  into  the  cosmos  to  understand  the  origin  of  the  uni-
verse, its structure, evolution and destiny.

The President’s FY 2006 Budget request for NASA is $16.456 billion, a 2.4 percent
increase from 2005, reflecting a strong commitment by the Administration to pursue
the exploration vision. The FY 2006 Budget request also makes some hard decisions,
canceling  some  projects  with  high  technical  risk  and  others  whose  cost  estimates
would have led to the certain cancellation and delay of several other important pro-
grams. The budget request maintains NASA’s focus on exploration and science while
strengthening the long-term foundation for continued success.

The  budget  requests  about  $3.2  billion  in  FY  2006  for  new  vehicles  and  tech-
nologies  to  enable  sustained  human  and  advanced  robotic  exploration  far  from
Earth. NASA has identified the major requirements for a Crew Exploration Vehicle
that will carry astronauts to the Moon. NASA plans to perform risk reduction tests
in 2008 and stage its first crewed flight by 2014. NASA will also continue pursuing
nuclear  technologies  for  space  applications,  optical  communications  for  high  data
rate  connectivity  to  space  probes,  radiation  shielding,  and  other  advanced  tech-
nologies to support the exploration vision. In addition, NASA is pursuing innovative
means to engage private industry including offering space prizes to spur innovation.
The budget requests approximately $5.5 billion in FY 2006 to continue advancing
our scientific understanding of the Sun, Earth, and planets and to inform decisions
regarding appropriate human exploration missions. NASA will also build on its leg-
acy  of  revolutionizing  astronomy  by  continuing  current  operations  of  space  tele-
scopes such as Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer while planning for the next generation
of  spacecraft  that  will  enhance  our  ability  to  find  planets  around  other  stars,  peer
deep  into  the  history  of  the  universe,  and  improve  our  understanding  of  its  struc-
ture.

The  FY  2006  Budget  continues  to  fund  critical  investments  in  Earth  science  sat-
ellites,  technologies,  and  research.  NASA  will  continue  to  play  a  major  part  in  the
interagency Climate Change Science Research Program, and contribute to the inter-
national initiative on the Global Earth Observing System of Systems.

The  budget  requests  approximately  $6.4  billion  in  FY  2006  for  operating  the
Space  Shuttle  and  continuing  assembly  and  operations  of  the  International  Space
Station.  NASA  is  examining  configurations  that  meet  the  needs  of  both  the  new
space exploration vision and our international partners using as few Shuttle flights
as possible to enable Shuttle retirement by 2010, following completion of its role in
ISS assembly. In concert with the new vision, NASA will refocus U.S. Space Station
research  on  activities  that  prepare  human  explorers  to  travel  beyond  low  Earth
orbit,  such  as  developing  countermeasures  against  space  radiation  and  under-
standing long-term physiological effects of reduced gravity.

As  the  United  States  implements  the  Vision  for  U.S.  Space  Exploration,  the  Ad-
ministration recognizes the value of effective cooperation with Russia to further our
space exploration goals. At the same time, we have to appropriately reflect U.S. non-
proliferation  policy  and  objectives  in  our  relationship  with  Russia.  The  Administra-
tion is thus interested in seeking a balanced approach that continues to protect our
nonproliferation  goals  while  advancing  potential  U.S.  cooperation  with  Russia  on
the  Vision  for  U.S.  Space  Exploration.  Such  a  balanced  approach  must  include  the
Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  (INA),  which  currently  complicates  cooperation

with Russia on the International Space Station (ISS), and will also have an adverse
impact  on  cooperation  with  Russia  on  our  future  space  exploration  efforts  related
to  human  space  flight.  To  that  end,  the  Administration  looks  forward  to  working
with  Congress  to  ensure  that  the  Vision  for  U.S.  Space  Exploration  is  able  to  suc-
ceed  while  remaining  fully  consistent  with  broader  U.S.  national  security  and  non-
proliferation goals.
Department of Commerce:

The  2006  Budget  provides  over  $1  billion  for  R&D  at  the  Department  of  Com-

merce.

National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  ‘‘core’’  programs  receive
$485 million, an increase of eight percent over 2005 (22 percent after earmarks are
excluded).  The  Administration  continues  to  insist  on  the  highest  priority  for  NIST
lab  research  because  it  is  producing  the  scientific  foundation  for  new  technologies
and providing essential technical support through its standards activities for indus-
trial development and commercialization of new and emerging technologies. The FY
2006 request is a 40 percent increase over 2001. NIST is proposing a new strategic
initiative  in  2006,  Advances  in  Manufacturing,  funded  at  $19.6  million,  and  a  new
NIST  business  plan  is  being  developed  to  better  focus  and  address  high  leverage
areas  of  advanced  manufacturing,  nanotechnology,  quantum  computing,  homeland
security, and biosystems and health.

The  FY  2006  Budget  again  proposes  to  terminate  the  Advanced  Technology  Pro-
gram  (ATP).  The  Administration  believes  firmly  that  other  NIST  research  and  de-
velopment  programs  have  profoundly  greater  impact  than  ATP,  and  are  essential
to  the  continued  technical  leadership  of  U.S.-based  businesses,  American  workers,
and the domestic economy. The Budget proposes to fund the Hollings Manufacturing
Extension  Partnership  Program  at  $47  million,  a  50-percent  reduction  from  the
2005  grant  level.  The  Administration’s  approach  will  maintain  a  strong  national
network  of  centers  while  focusing  funding  based  on  centers’  performance  in  pro-
viding  information  and  consulting  services  to  small  manufacturers.  The  program
has  also  augmented  funding  through  expanding  partnerships  with  other  agencies
and institutions. Given this new operating environment, the Administration believes
the  program  has  evolved  to  a  stage  at  which  less  reliance  on  direct  appropriations
is required.

For  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  the  FY  2006
Budget  provides  $361  million  for  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Research  (OAR),  an  11
percent reduction from 2005 enacted, due mostly to earmarks. This investment pro-
vides for ongoing research on climate, weather, air quality, and ocean processes. For
NOAA  programs  that  support  the  climate  change  science  program,  $181  million  is
provided, and Sea Grants are sustained at the 2005 level of $61 million.

To  improve  efficiency,  the  Budget  also  streamlines  administrative  layers  within
the Technology Administration (TA). The Budget reflects TA’s intent to evaluate its
current operating practices and incorporate methods to improve the effectiveness of
its operations.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):

The  FY  2006  EPA  S&T  request  is  $792  million,  a  two  percent  increase  over  FY
2005, even before removing $70 million in earmarks. This investment supports core
Agency  programs  and  strengthens  the  application  of  science  to  EPA  regulatory  ac-
tions and other programs.

The  Administration  is  directing  $20  million  of  S&T  funding  to  a  new  pilot  pro-
gram  within  EPA  that  the  program  offices  (e.g.,  Water,  Office  of  Solid  Waste  and
Emergency  Response,  Air)  would  then  use  to  fund  applied  research  in  the  Office  of
Research  and  Development  (ORD).  This  is  intended  to  improve  the  use  of  ORD  (to
avoid  duplicative  program  efforts),  coordination  between  the  program  offices  and
ORD,  and  responsiveness  and  accountability.  This  program  contributes  to  the  over-
all increase in S&T funding.

$79  million  in  new  funding  will  support  homeland  security  projects  and  research
at EPA related to water security monitoring and surveillance, post-incident building
and  environmental  decontamination,  and  Environmental  Laboratory  Preparedness
and Response.

The  FY  2006  Budget  requests  approximately  $65  million  for  the  Science  to
Achieve Results (STAR) program, which includes a decrease in exploratory research
grants. Given the overall tightness of EPA’s budget (-6 percent from 2005 enacted),
and the need to fun core programmatic needs, STAR grants, which cannot focus on
EPA program needs, were reduced.

Department of Transportation (DOT):

The  FY  2006  Budget  request  for  highway-related  research  is  $543  million,  $23
million less than 2005, before removing significant earmarks. Highway research in-
cludes  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  transportation  research  and  tech-
nology contract programs, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research
and  analysis,  and  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administration  research  and  tech-
nology.

The 2006 request for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Research, Engineer-
ing  and  Development  is  $130  million,  virtually  the  same  as  2005’s  $131  million.  In
2003, Congress created the Next Generation Air Transportation System Joint Plan-
ning and Development Office (JPDO) [Public Law 108–176] to coordinate the goals,
priorities, and research activities across the Federal Government relative to the air
transportation system. The JPDO vision was articulated in their Integrated Plan re-
leased  on  December  12,  2004  and  the  research  needs  identified  to  date  are  being
addressed  through  prioritization  and  leveraging  of  existing  funds  at  FAA,  NASA,
and DOD.
PRIORITY INITIATIVES

The  2006  budget  highlights  priority  interagency  initiatives  described  briefly
below.  These  initiatives  are  coordinated  through  the  National  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Council  (NSTC)  for  which  my  office  has  responsibility  for  day-to-day  oper-
ations. The Council prepares research and development strategies that cross agency
boundaries to form a consolidated and coordinated investment package.
Networking  and  Information  Technology  R&D—With  President  Bush’s  FY
2006 Budget request of $2.2 billion for the Networking and Information Technology
R&D  (NITRD)  program,  the  investment  in  this  area  over  five  years  will  total  more
than  $10.4  billion.  Research  in  networking  and  information  technologies  underpins
advances  in  virtually  every  other  area  of  science  and  technology  and  provides  new
capacity  for  economic  productivity.  Through  active  coordination,  NITRD  agencies
mutually  leverage  resources  to  make  broader  advances  in  networking  and  informa-
tion technology than any single agency could attain.

• NSF continues to provide the largest share of federal NITRD funding, reflect-
ing  the  Foundation’s  broad  mission  as  well  as  its  leadership  role  in  coordi-
nating  NITRD  activities.  The  FY  2006  request  for  NSF  is  $803  million,  an
$8 million increase from the 2005 estimate.
• High-end  computing  continues  to  be  a  major  focus  within  the  NITRD  pro-
gram.  In  FY  2004,  the  interagency  High  End  Computing  Revitalization  Task
Force  (HECRTF)  produced  the  Federal  Plan  for  High-End  Computing,  which
describes a roadmap for progress in core technologies for high-end computing,
mechanisms for improving access to high-end computing resources, and strat-
egies  for  improving  federal  procurement  and  coordination  of  high-end  sys-
tems.  The  FY  2006  budget  reflects  the  continuation  of  NITRD  activities  that
are  consistent  with  recommendations  described  in  the  Federal  Plan,  such  as
investments  in  new  high-end  systems  by  NASA  and  DOE’s  Office  of  Science.
• NASA continues to emphasize high-end computing within its NITRD portfolio
through the recently-completed acquisition of the Project Columbia supercom-
puter,  a  portion  of  which  NASA  plans  to  make  available  to  other  federal
users.  Following  completion  of  the  acquisition  of  Columbia,  NASA’s  expendi-
ture in high-end computing is normalizing at a lower level.
• DOE’s  Office  of  Science  has  also  committed  to  operate  their  new  Leadership
Class Computing facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a national
user facility. DOE’s FY 2006 request of $25 million for the Leadership facility
brings that federal investment to $100 million.

National Nanotechnology Initiative—President Bush’s FY 2006 Budget provides
over $1 billion for the multi-agency National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), bring-
ing  the  total  NNI  investment  under  this  Administration  to  $4.7  billion.  This  sus-
tained  investment  will  advance  our  understanding  of  the  unique  phenomena  and
processes that occur at the nanometer scale and expedite the responsible use of this
knowledge to achieve advances in medicine, manufacturing, high-performance mate-
rials, information technology, and energy and environmental technologies.

ment  and  infrastructure  that  will  be  broadly  available  to  researchers  from
across the scientific research community. Construction completion keeps total
DOE  NNI  spending  flat  in  FY  2006,  but  a  portion  of  construction  roll-off
funds are made available for operational support.
• The  FY  2006  request  of  $147  million  by  HHS  includes  programs  at  NIH  em-
phasizing  nanotechnology-based  biomedical  advances  occurring  at  the  inter-
section  of  biology  and  the  physical  sciences,  such  as  the  National  Cancer  In-
stitute’s Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer, and at the National Institute
of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that address implications and ap-
plications of nanotechnology for health and safety in the workplace.

federal  agencies  currently

participate in coordination. Agencies that have joined the NNI as participants
over  the  past  year  include  the  U.S.  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  and  the
Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission,  indicating  the  increasing  importance
of commercialization activities.

Climate  Change  Research  and  Development—The  FY  2006  Budget  continues
strong  support  for  the  Climate  Change  Science  Program  (CCSP)  and  the  Climate
Change Technology Program (CCTP).

• The  CCSP  budget  continues  to  support  the  goals  outlined  in  the  CCSP  Stra-
tegic  Plan,  which  was  released  in  July  2003.  Beginning  in  FY  2006,  CCSP
will formally track the expected actions, deliverables, and milestones for each
of its programs in order to assess overall performance.
• The  FY  2006  Budget  proposes  approximately  $1.9  billion  to  fund  CCSP,  vir-
tually  the  same  as  2005  despite  reductions  in  NASA  (-$102  million)  due  to
re-prioritization of programs. With this request, the Administration will have
invested  more  than  $9  billion  over  five  years  to  improve  our  understanding
of the global climate system.
• The FY 2006 Budget provides approximately $2.9 billion for the U.S. Climate
Change  Technology  Program  (CCTP),  which  supports  research,  development,
deployment,  and  voluntary  programs  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  via
renewable  energy,  fossil  energy  and  nuclear  energy,  efficiency  improvements,
and carbon sequestration.
• In  2005,  the  CCTP  will  publish  a  draft  Strategic  Plan  and  solicit  comments
from  the  scientific  community  and  the  public.  The  CCTP  will  also  identify
within its portfolio a subset of National Climate Change Technology Initiative
(NCCTI) priority activities.

Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative—The  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  (HFI)  seeks  to  develop
new  science  and  technology  to  support  a  major  shift  toward  the  use  of  hydrogen  as
an  energy  medium,  particularly  for  transportation.  The  FY  2006  Budget  for  HFI  is
$260 million, $35 million (16 percent) greater than the FY 2005 level. The Initiative
remains on track to meet President Bush’s five-year, $1.2 billion commitment to hy-
drogen  research  and  development  announced  in  his  2003  State  of  the  Union  ad-
dress. Some highlights include:

• $20 million, an $11 million (122 percent) increase over FY 2005, will fund the
Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative. This initiative will conduct the R&D on enabling
technologies,  demonstrate  nuclear-based  hydrogen  production  technologies,
and  study  potential  hydrogen  production  schemes  to  support  the  President’s
vision for a future Hydrogen economy.
• $33 million for fundamental research within DOE’s Office of Science. This re-
search  seeks  to  overcome  key  technical  hurdles  in  hydrogen  production,  stor-
age, and conversion, by seeking revolutionary breakthroughs in areas such as
non-precious-metal  catalysts,  high-temperature  membrane  materials,  multi-
functional nanoscale structures, biological and photoelectrochemical hydrogen
production, and precision manufacturing processes.
• Congressional earmarking is slowing progress on HFI, however, and may jeop-

advances  in  protecting  the  First  Responders  are  moving  from  laboratory  to  oper-
ational use. The President’s FY 2006 Budget continues an aggressive investment in
research, development, and the research infrastructure so as to further enhance our
nation’s security. Priority research areas include:

• $227  million  to  fund  the  creation  of  a  Domestic  Nuclear  Defense  Office
(DNDO) in DHS, whose responsibility will be to develop a comprehensive sys-
tem  to  detect  and  mitigate  any  attempt  to  import  or  transport  a  nuclear  ex-
plosive  device,  fissile  material  or  radiological  material  intended  for  illicit  use
within the U.S.
• $1.8 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fund
research  and  development  of  countermeasures  against  biological,  chemical
and radiological threat agents.
• $596  million  is  allocated  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  HHS  and
DHS  to  improve  food  and  agriculture  defense.  This  includes  funding  for  re-
search on exotic and emerging diseases of plants and animals and to prevent
and detect food contamination, expanding and improving laboratory facilities,
and enhancing disease monitoring, surveillance and vaccine storage.
• $94  million  will  fund  new  and  ongoing  research  at  EPA  related  to  their  role
in  water  security  and  post-incident  decontamination.  Systems  for  monitoring
and  surveillance  of  terrorist  threat  agents  in  drinking  water  will  be  piloted
in  several  U.S.  cities.  Decontamination  capabilities  will  be  strengthened  by
testing  new  cleaning  methods,  systems  and  antimicrobial  products  for  build-
ings  and  outdoor  areas  and  by  conducting  risk  assessment  work  to  support
decontamination/revision of cleanup guidance goals.

MANAGING THE FEDERAL RESEARCH BUDGET

Consistent  with  the  President’s  Management  Agenda,  the  Administration  is  im-
proving the effectiveness of the Federal Government’s investments in R&D by apply-
ing  transparent  investment  criteria  in  analyses  that  inform  recommendations  for
program  funding  and  management.  R&D  performance  assessment  must  be  done
carefully  to  avoid  negatively  impacting  scientific  productivity.  Research  often  leads
scientists  and  engineers  down  unpredictable  pathways  with  unpredictable  results.
This  characteristic  of  research  requires  special  consideration  when  measuring  an
R&D program’s performance against its initial goals.

Elements  of  good  R&D  program  management  include  establishing  priorities  with
expected results, specifying criteria that programs or projects must meet to be start-
ed  or  continued,  setting  clear  milestones  for  gauging  progress,  and  identifying
metrics for assessing results.

The  R&D  Investment  Criteria  accommodate  the  very  wide  range  of  R&D  activi-
ties,  from  basic  research  to  development  and  demonstration  programs,  by  address-
ing three fundamental aspects of R&D:

evant, and appropriate for federal investment;

• Relevance—Programs must be able to articulate why they are important, rel-
• Quality—Programs must justify how funds will be allocated to ensure quality;
• Performance—Programs  must  be  able  to  monitor  and  document  how  well  the

and

investments are performing.

R&D  projects  and  programs  relevant  to  industry  are  expected  to  meet  criteria  to
determine the appropriateness of the public investment, enable comparisons of pro-
posed  and  demonstrated  benefits,  and  provide  meaningful  decision  points  for  com-
pleting or transitioning the activity to the private sector.

OSTP  and  OMB  are  continuing  to  assess  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  R&D
programs  across  the  Federal  Government  in  order  to  identify  and  apply  good  R&D
management practices throughout the government.
CONCLUSION

Making  choices  is  difficult  even  when  budgets  are  generous.  But  tight  budgets
have  the  virtue  of  focusing  on  priorities  and  strengthening  program  management.
This year’s R&D budget proposal maintains levels of funding that allow America to
maintain  its  leadership  position  in  science  and  move  ahead  in  selected  priority
areas.  It  is  responsible  in  its  treatment  of  security-related  science  and  technology,
and it rewards good planning and management.

America  currently  spends  one  and  a  half  times  as  much  on  federally  funded  re-
search  and  development  as  Europe  does,  and  three  times  as  much  as  Japan,  the
next  highest  investor  in  R&D.  Our  scientists  collectively  have  the  best  laboratories

in the world, the most extensive infrastructure supporting research, the greatest op-
portunities to pursue novel lines of investigation, and the most freedom to turn their
discoveries into profitable ventures if they are inclined to do so.

We lead not only in science, but also in translating science to economically signifi-

cant products that enhance the quality of life for all people.

This  budget  will  sustain  this  leadership  and  maintain  science  and  technology  ca-
pabilities that are the envy of the world. I would be pleased to respond to questions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOHN H. MARBURGER, III

John  H.  Marburger,  III,  Science  Adviser  to  the  President  and  Director  of  the  Of-
fice  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  was  born  on  Staten  Island,  N.Y.,  grew  up  in
Maryland  near  Washington  D.C.  and  attended  Princeton  University  (B.A.,  Physics
1962)  and  Stanford  University  (Ph.D.,  Applied  Physics  1967).  Before  his  appoint-
ment  in  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President,  he  served  as  Director  of  Brookhaven
National  Laboratory  from  1998,  and  as  the  third  President  of  the  State  University
of New York at Stony Brook (1980–1994). He came to Long Island in 1980 from the
University  of  Southern  California  where  he  had  been  a  Professor  of  Physics  and
Electrical  Engineering,  serving  as  Physics  Department  Chairman  and  Dean  of  the
College  of  Letters,  Arts  and  Sciences  in  the  1970’s.  In  the  fall  of  1994  he  returned
to  the  faculty  at  Stony  Brook,  teaching  and  doing  research  in  optical  science  as  a
University Professor. Three years later he became President of Brookhaven Science
Associates,  a  partnership  between  the  university  and  Battelle  Memorial  Institute
that competed for and won the contract to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory.
While at the University of Southern California, Marburger contributed to the rap-
idly growing field of nonlinear optics, a subject created by the invention of the laser
in  1960.  He  developed  theory  for  various  laser  phenomena  and  was  a  co-founder  of
the  University  of  Southern  California’s  Center  for  Laser  Studies.  His  teaching  ac-
tivities included ‘‘Frontiers of Electronics,’’ a series of educational programs on CBS
television.

Marburger’s presidency at Stony Brook coincided with the opening and growth of
University  Hospital  and  the  development  of  the  biological  sciences  as  a  major
strength  of  the  university.  During  the  1980’s  federally  sponsored  scientific  research
at  Stony  Brook  grew  to  exceed  that  of  any  other  public  university  in  the  north-
eastern United States.

During his presidency, Marburger served on numerous boards and committees, in-
cluding  chairmanship  of  the  Governor’s  Commission  on  the  Shoreham  Nuclear
Power  facility,  and  chairmanship  of  the  80  campus  ‘‘Universities  Research  Associa-
tion’’  which  operates  Fermi  National  Accelerator  Laboratory  near  Chicago.  He
served  as  a  trustee  of  Princeton  University  and  many  other  organizations.  He  also
chaired the highly successful 1991/92 Long Island United Way campaign.

As a public spirited scientist-administrator, Marburger has served local, State and
Federal governments in a variety of capacities. He is credited with bringing an open,
reasoned approach to contentious issues where science intersects with the needs and
concerns  of  society.  His  strong  leadership  of  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  fol-
lowing a series of environmental and management crises is widely acknowledged to
have  won  back  the  confidence  and  support  of  the  community  while  preserving  the
Laboratory’s record of outstanding science.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Doctor.
Mr. Secretary, you are up.
STATEMENT OF DR. SAMUEL W. BODMAN, SECRETARY OF

ENERGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Secretary  BODMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  very  grateful,  sir,  to  be
here  again  before  this  committee  and  to  discuss  the  President’s
2006 budget request for science in particular at the Department of
Energy.

As  you  are  well  aware,  I  believe  very  passionately  in  the  role
that  science  has  played  over  the  last  century,  really,  in  the  eco-
nomic growth of our country. And I really believe that what occurs
in this budget will continue that record on into the future.

I appreciate very much what this committee has done to advance
American  science  over  the  years,  and  I  want  to  thank  you  all  for

that  and  let  you  know  that  I  am  very  anxious  in  providing  leader-
ship  for  the  Department  of  Energy  because  of  the  pivotal  role  that
the  Department  plays  in  funding  science  and  technology  through-
out our country.

Scientists  working  for  the  Department’s  National  Laboratories
and  in  universities  funded  by  the  Department  of  Energy  over  the
years  have  been  awarded  more  than  80  Nobel  Prizes.  And  to  my
knowledge, no one else comes anywhere close to being able to make
that kind of statement.

I  particularly  want  to  recognize  today,  in  public,  the  extraor-
dinary  leadership  that  Dr.  Orbach  has  provided,  who  is  our  Direc-
tor  of  the  Office  of  Science.  I  think  he  is  here  today.  I  saw  him  in
the room earlier. And he has done just——

Chairman BOEHLERT. You know he is here.
Secretary  BODMAN.  He  has  done  quite  an  extraordinary  job,  and
I  wanted  to  recognize  him.  He  has  really  brought  a  sense  of  mis-
sion  and  focus  to  that  job,  which  is  very  admirable.  The  truth  be
known, I am here in his—I pulled rank on him so that I could come
before this committee again.

This  Department’s  responsibility  for  the  future  of  science  is  best
illustrated  by  our  stewardship  of  the  Nation’s  scientific  infrastruc-
ture  through  our  system  of  world-class  National  Laboratories.  In
addition  to  the  Office  of  Science,  the  Department  has  a  robust  re-
search and development portfolio extending across our programs in
fossil energy, in nuclear energy, in renewable energy, in energy ef-
ficiency, environmental management, and in fact, in national secu-
rity. So we cover a broad range.

The Department is the single largest supporter of research in the
physical  sciences.  And  as  such,  we  have  a  special  and  particularly
important role in this field of scientific endeavor, and it is one that
I take very seriously.

The budget request, as Dr. Marburger just mentioned, for the Of-
fice  of  Science,  is  $3.5  billion,  and  it  will  maintain  a  very  solid
foundation  for  scientific  discovery  in  our  country.  In  light  of  the
emphasis  that  this  budget  places  on  deficit  control,  this  level  of
funding for the Office of Science signals a very strong commitment
on  the  part  of  the  Administration  to  invest  in  the  promise  of  basic
research for discoveries that leapfrog today’s technology.

The priorities that we have set are very clear. Through the 2006
budget,  we  will  fully  support  presidential  initiatives  in  fusion  and
hydrogen. We will continue strong support for other Administration
priorities,  such  as  nanotechnology  and  information  technology.  We
will complete on time and within budget unique scientific facilities
that  will  maintain  an  enhanced  research  in  areas  that  we  believe
offer  the  greatest  potential  for  broad  advances  in  future  energy
technologies.  These  scientific  facilities  were  prioritized  in  our  20-
year  facilities  outlook  that  was  announced  and  published  in  No-
vember of 2003.

We  will  continue  moving  ahead  with  our  FreedomCAR  research
and  the  President’s  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  to  develop  hydrogen-
fueled vehicles and the infrastructure to support them. We are also
carrying forward with U.S. participation in the International Ther-
monuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER as it is known, a project
that will pursue the potential of energy from nuclear fusion.

One  of  the  biggest  science  stories  of  the  year  2006  will  be  the
start-up  of  the  Spallation  Neutron  Source  at  our  Oak  Ridge  Na-
tional  Laboratory,  which  will  provide  the  most  intense  neutron
beam in the world for cutting-edge research.

Our  fiscal  year  2006  will  also  bring  four  of  our  five  nanoscale
science research centers on line, providing tools found nowhere else
in  the  world  for  exploration  at  the  atomic  level,  offering  huge  po-
tential for the discovery of entirely new ways to build materials.

We  are  fully  funding  construction  of  the  Linac  Coherent  Light
Source  at  the  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator  Center,  a  machine  that
will  produce  x-rays  10  billion  times  brighter  than  any  existing  x-
ray  source  on  earth.  When  it  comes  on  line  in  2009,  it  essentially
will  allow  stop-action  photography  of  atomic  motion.  Anyone  that
doubts  the  seriousness  of  this  kind  of  accomplishment  should  ask
someone  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  just  how  they  could  use  a
machine that shows the chemical bonds that are formed during the
course of a chemical reaction.

The Office of Science will also fully fund the National Energy Re-
search  Scientific  Computing  Center,  a  key  center  for  capacity
supercomputing used by roughly 2,000 researchers every year, and
a  separate  open-access  leadership  class  computing  facility  focused
on  providing  the  capability  to  carry  out  a  limited  number  of  mas-
sive  simulations  not  possible  on  any  other  civilian  supercomputer
in the United States.

The  Department  will  also  expand  research  underpinning  bio-
technology  solutions  to  the  world’s  energy  challenges  and  research
supporting the President’s climate change science program.

Our  research  programs  in  high-energy  physics  continue  to  re-
ceive  strong  support.  We  have  enhanced  funding  for  future  accel-
erators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, scheduled to begin op-
eration  in  2007,  and  the  proposed  International  Linear  Collider,
which  is  now  in  early  research  and  development  phase.  Our  nu-
clear physics program will continue to offer world-class facilities for
use by thousands of researchers around the world.

While this hearing focuses on civilian science and technology pro-
grams  that  are  authorized  by  this  committee,  I  want  to  note  the
significant  contributions  to  science  that  also  occur  at  the  National
Nuclear  Security  Administration’s,  or  NNSA’s,  nuclear  weapons
laboratories,  which  are  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Armed  Serv-
ices  Committee.  Work  at  the  weapons  laboratories  primarily  fo-
cuses  on  stockpile  stewardship  and  the  Office  of  Science  and  the
NNSA will work together on a number of activities.

The President’s budget request for the Office of Science allows us
to  build  on  the  solid  foundation  created  over  the  last  four  years,
propels  us  into  new  areas  of  scientific  leadership,  and  maintains
America’s  leadership  in  science,  something  that  we  are  very  much
committed to.

And  I,  too,  would  be  happy  to  take  questions  at  the  appropriate

time.

Thank you, sir.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SAMUEL W. BODMAN

Chairman Boehlert, Congressman Gordon, Members of the Committee, thank you
for welcoming me back, this time in my new role as Secretary of Energy. I am grate-
ful for the opportunity to discuss the President’s fiscal year 2006 budget for science
at the Department of Energy.

I come before you this morning with tremendous enthusiasm for the Department’s
mission  to  maintain  and  enhance  America’s  leadership  in  science  and  technology.
That responsibility is best illustrated by the Department’s Office of Science stew-
ardship  of  our  nation’s  scientific  infrastructure  through  a  system  of  10  world-class
National  Laboratories.  In  addition  to  the  Office  of  Science,  the  Department  has  a
robust  research-and-development  portfolio  extending  across  our  programs  in  fossil
energy, nuclear energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, environmental manage-
ment and national security.

The  Department  is  the  single  largest  supporter  of  research  in  the  physical
sciences, and as such, we have a special and particularly important role in this field
of scientific endeavor.

The budget request for the Office of Science of $3.5 billion maintains a solid foun-
dation  for  scientific  discovery.  In  light  of  the  emphasis  that  this  Budget  places  on

tential  for  broad  advances  in  future  energy  technologies.  These  scientific  facilities
were prioritized in our 20-year facilities outlook, announced in November 2003.

We  will  continue  moving  ahead  with  our  FreedomCAR  research  and  the  Presi-
dent’s  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  to  develop  hydrogen-fueled  vehicles  and  the  infra-
structure  to  support  them.  We  are  also  carrying  forward  with  U.S.  participation  in
the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project to pursue the poten-
tial of energy from nuclear fusion.

BIOGRAPHY FOR SAMUEL W. BODMAN

Samuel  Wright  Bodman  was  sworn  in  as  the  11th  Secretary  of  Energy  on  Feb-
ruary  1,  2005  after  the  United  States  Senate  unanimously  confirmed  him  on  Janu-
ary  31,  2005.  He  leads  the  Department  of  Energy  with  a  budget  in  excess  of  $23
billion and over 100,000 federal and contractor employees.

Previously,  Secretary  Bodman  served  as  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  begin-
ning in February 2004. He also served the Bush Administration as the Deputy Sec-
retary of the Department of Commerce beginning in 2001. A financier and executive
by  trade,  with  three  decades  of  experience  in  the  private  sector,  Secretary  Bodman
was well suited manage the day-to-day operations of both of these cabinet agencies.
Born in 1938 in Chicago, he graduated in 1961 with a B.S. in chemical engineer-
ing from Cornell University. In 1965, he completed his ScD at Massachusetts Insti-
tute  of  Technology.  For  the  next  six  years  he  served  as  an  Associate  Professor  of
Chemical  Engineering  at  MIT  and  began  his  work  in  the  financial  sector  as  Tech-
nical  Director  of  the  American  Research  and  Development  Corporation,  a  pioneer
venture  capital  firm.  He  and  his  colleagues  provided  financial  and  managerial  sup-
port to scores of new business enterprises located throughout the United States.

From  there,  Secretary  Bodman  went  to  Fidelity  Venture  Associates,  a  division  of
the Fidelity Investments. In 1983 he was named President and Chief Operating Of-
ficer of Fidelity Investments and a Director of the Fidelity Group of Mutual Funds.
In  1987,  he  joined  Cabot  Corporation,  a  Boston-based  Fortune  300  company  with
global  business  activities  in  specialty  chemicals  and  materials,  where  he  served  as
Chairman,  CEO,  and  a  Director.  Over  the  years,  he  has  been  a  Director  of  many
other publicly owned corporations.

Secretary  Bodman  has  also  been  active  in  public  service.  He  is  a  former  Director
of  M.I.T.’s  School  of  Engineering  Practice  and  a  former  member  of  the  M.I.T.  Com-
mission on Education. He also served as a member of the Executive and Investment
Committees at M.I.T., a member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and
a  Trustee  of  the  Isabella  Stewart  Gardner  Museum  and  the  New  England  Aquar-
ium.

Secretary  Bodman  is  married  to  M.  Diane  Bodman.  He  has  three  children,  two

stepchildren, and eight grandchildren.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.
Dr. Bement.

STATEMENT OF DR. ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR., DIRECTOR,

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION

Dr.  BEMENT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Gor-
don, and members of the Committee. I am pleased to appear before
you  today  to  discuss  NSF’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request.  And  I
want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your unabashed support and
that of your colleagues for NSF over the years. Thank you.

NSF’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  reflects  the  Administra-
tion’s  support  for  our  mission.  In  light  of  the  tight  fiscal  climate,
we believe we have fared relatively well. For the coming fiscal year,
NSF  requests  $5.6  billion,  an  increase  of  $132  million,  or  2.4  per-
cent  over  last  year’s  appropriated  levels.  The  total  funding  for
NSF’s  Research  and  Related  Activities  [RRA]  account  in  this  re-
quest  increases  by  $113  million,  nearly  three  percent,  to  $4.33  bil-
lion.

Of this amount, $48 million is transferred to NSF from the Coast
Guard  for  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  related  to  ice
breaking in the Antarctic. We are currently working with the Coast
Guard to explore options for funding icebreaker services in support
of science within available NSF resources for fiscal year 2006.

Maintaining  strong  and  robust  research  programs  in  support  of
individual  investigators  and  small  groups  of  researchers  is  at  the
core  of  NSF’s  mission.  In  many  scientific  disciplines,  NSF  is  the
major  source  of  federal  funding  to  academic  institutions.  One  goal
in  this  year’s  request  is  to  strengthen  our  research  support  across
all areas in our portfolio.

Research,  however,  is  only  part  of  the  NSF  equation.  Our  mis-
sion  includes  education  as  well.  In  our  request,  we  will  maintain
a total investment of almost $400 million for programs with a prov-
en  track  record  of  broadening  the  participation  of  under-rep-
resented  groups  in  the  science  and  engineering  arena.  The  Louis
Stokes  Alliances  for  Minority  Participation,  the  Centers  for  Re-
search  Excellence  in  Science  and  Technology,  the  Robert  Noyce
Scholarship  program,  the  STEM  Talent  Expansion  Program,  and
EPSCoR, to name just a few, are protected from reductions in this
request.

Overall, the Education and Human Resources Directorate at NSF
will  be  funded  at  $737  million,  down  12.4  percent  from  last  year.
Although  we  have  found  it  necessary  to  make  cuts  in  these  pro-
grams, we are also finding ways to leverage other resources in sup-
port  of  education.  We  will,  for  example,  continue  to  encourage  the
types of partnerships between researchers and students in our RRA
portfolio that provide hands-on learning experiences.

We  are  committed  to  ensuring  that  future  generations  gain  the
skills, knowledge, and insight that comes from working at the fron-
tier  of  discovery.  We  will  also  maintain  our  strong  working  rela-
tionship with the Department of Education to implement best prac-
tices in their initiatives supporting math and science education.

While there are no new starts in our Major Research Equipment
and  Facilities  Construction  account,  NSF  is  increasing  funding  in
this  account  by  $76  million  for  a  total  of  $250  million  to  continue
to fund ongoing projects.

The  NSF  directly  supports  roughly  200,000  scientists,  educators,
and students and processes over 40,000 proposals a year. Balancing
the needs of a growing, increasingly complex portfolio with new re-
quirements for security, e-business, accountability, and award over-
sight  presents  an  ongoing  challenge.  In  order  to  meet  these  man-
agement  goals,  NSF  will  increase  funding  for  activities  that  ad-
vance  organizational  excellence  by  $46  million  to  a  total  of  $336
million.  This  increase  will  allow  for  the  recruitment  of  23  addi-
tional  full-time  employees,  enhancement  and  security  of  our  e-gov-
ernment  systems,  and  continuing  the  implementation  of  the  busi-
ness analysis recommendations that we have been working on dur-
ing the past three years.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  touched  upon  the  variety  and  richness  of
the  NSF  portfolio,  but  I  have  only  scratched  the  surface.  NSF  re-
search  and  education  efforts  contribute  greatly  to  the  Nation’s  in-
novation-driven economy and help keep America at the forefront of
science  and  engineering.  NSF-supported  researchers  produce  lead-
ing-edge  discoveries  that  serve  society  and  spark  the  public’s  curi-
osity and interest. Extraordinary discoveries coming from dozens of
NSF programs are enriching the entire science and engineering en-
terprise  and  making  education  fun,  exciting,  and  achievement-ori-
ented.

With  that,  I  would  be  glad  to  answer  any  questions  you  may

have.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Bement follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ARDEN L. BEMENT, JR.

Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,
thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  discuss  NSF’s  FY  2006  budget  Request.  It  is  a
pleasure  to  appear  before  you  today.  For  over  fifty  years,  NSF  has  been  charged
with being a strong steward of the scientific discovery and innovation that has been
crucial  to  increasing  America’s  economic  strength,  global  competitiveness,  national
security, and overall quality of life.

For many years, the United States economy has depended heavily on investments
in  research  and  development—and  with  good  reason.  America’s  sustained  economic
prosperity is based on technological innovation made possible, in large part, by fun-
damental  science  and  engineering  research.  Innovation  and  technology  are  the  en-
gines  of  the  American  economy,  and  advances  in  science  and  engineering  provide
the fuel.

Investments in science and technology—both public and private—have driven eco-
nomic  growth  and  improved  the  quality  of  life  in  America  for  the  last  200  years.
They have generated new knowledge and new industries, created new jobs, ensured
economic  and  national  security,  reduced  pollution  and  increased  energy  efficiency,
provided  better  and  safer  transportation,  improved  medical  care,  and  increased  liv-
ing standards for the American people. Innovation and technology have become the
engines of the American economy, and advances in science and engineering provide
the fuel.

Investments  in  research  and  development  are  among  the  highest-payback  invest-
ments a nation can make. Over the past 50 years technological innovation has been
responsible for as much as half of the Nation’s growth in productivity.

Sustaining  this  innovation  requires  an  understanding  of  the  factors  that  con-
tribute  to  it.  The  Council  on  Competitiveness,  a  consortium  of  industry,  university,
and labor leaders, has developed quantitative measures of national competitiveness:
the number of R&D personnel in the available workforce; total R&D investment; the
percentage  of  R&D  funded  by  private  industry;  the  percentage  of  R&D  performed
by  the  university  sector;  spending  on  higher  education;  the  strength  of  intellectual
property  protection,  openness  to  international  competition;  and  per  capita  gross  do-
mestic  product.  A  similar  set  of  indicators  has  been  developed  by  the  World  Bank
Group,  and  voluminous  data  have  been  compiled  by  NSF.  The  important  point  un-
derscored by these indicators is that, for America to remain a prosperous and secure
country, it must maintain its technological leadership in the world.

Perhaps  the  Council  on  Competitiveness’  2004  National  Innovation  Initiative  re-
port captured it best by simply stating, ‘‘Innovation has always been the way people
solved the great challenges facing society.’’

Often times, the connection between an area of research, or even a particular sci-
entific discovery, and an innovation may be far from obvious. Fundamental research
in  physics,  mathematics  and  high-flux  magnets  supported  by  NSF  led  to  the  devel-
opment  of  today’s  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (MRI)  technology.  Today,  MRIs  are
used  widely  to  detect  cancer  and  internal  tissue  damage.  Fundamental  research  on
extremophiles, or microorganisms living in extreme environments, led to the polym-
erase  chain  reaction,  a  procedure  paramount  to  modern  biotechnology,  as  well  as
one  that  allows  us  to  use  DNA  for  forensic  evidence.  Continuing  progress  in  basic
science  and  engineering  research  promises  more  discoveries  as  well  as  further  im-
provements in living standards and economic performance.

And  still,  science  and  engineering  is  becoming  an  ever-larger  portion  of  our  na-
tion’s  productivity.  In  the  early  1950s,  Jacob  Bronowski  wrote,  ‘‘The  world  today  is
powered by science.’’ I would take this premise one step farther, ‘‘No science; no eco-
nomic growth.’’ Our current level of scientific and technological productivity is what
keeps  us  ahead  of  our  global  competitors  as  the  playing  field  continues  to  become
more level.

NSF  has  helped  advance  America’s  basic  science  and  engineering  enterprise  for
over  fifty  years.  Despite  its  small  size,  NSF  has  an  extraordinary  impact  on  sci-
entific  and  engineering  knowledge  and  capacity.  While  NSF  represents  only  four
percent of the total federal budget for research and development, it accounts for 50
percent  of  non-life  science  basic  research  at  academic  institutions.  In  fact,  NSF  is
the  only  federal  agency  that  supports  all  fields  of  science  and  engineering  research
and  the  educational  programs  that  sustain  them  across  generations.  NSF’s  pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

51

grams  reach  over  2,000  institutions  across  the  Nation,  and  they  involve  roughly
200,000 researchers, teachers, and students.

NSF  specifically  targets  its  investments  in  fundamental  research  at  the  frontiers
of  science  and  engineering.  Here,  advances  push  the  boundaries  of  innovation,
progress and productivity.

Compared  to  other  commodities,  knowledge  generated  from  basic  science  invest-
ments  is  unique,  long  lasting  and  leverages  on  itself.  Knowledge  can  be  shared,
stored and distributed easily, and it does not diminish by use. Incremental advances
in  knowledge  are  synergistic  over  time.  NSF  is  proud  to  have  built  the  foundation
for this knowledge base through decades of peer-reviewed, merit-based research.
FY 2006 Budget Request

The Foundation’s FY 2006 budget Request reflects the Administration’s confidence
in  our  continuing  with  this  mission.  In  light  of  the  tight  fiscal  climate,  NSF  fared
relatively  well.  For  the  coming  fiscal  year,  NSF  requests  $5.6  billion,  an  increase
of $132 million, or 2.4 percent, over last year’s appropriated levels.

At  a  time  when  many  agencies  are  looking  at  budget  cuts,  an  increase  in  our
budget  underscores  the  Administration’s  support  of  NSF’s  science  and  engineering
programs, and reflects the agency’s excellent management and program results.

With  the  wealth  of  benefits  that  investments  in  science  and  engineering  bring  to
the  Nation,  perhaps  none  is  more  powerful  than  the  capability  to  respond  quickly
and  effectively  to  challenges  of  all  kinds.  NSF’s  programs  reach  over  2,000  institu-
tions  across  the  Nation,  and  they  involve  researchers,  teachers,  and  students  in  all
fields  of  science  and  engineering  and  at  all  levels  of  education.  They  also  keep  us
abreast  of  scientific  advances  throughout  the  world.  This  breadth  of  activity  in  and
of itself creates a vital national resource, as it provides the Nation with a constantly
invigorated  base  of  knowledge,  talent,  and  technology.  For  example,  in  areas  rang-
ing  from  terrorism  threats  to  natural  disasters,  NSF’s  ongoing  support  of  research
in  areas  such  as  advanced  information  technologies,  sensors,  and  earthquake  engi-
neering  ensures  a  broad  base  of  expertise  and  equipment  that  allows  the  science
and engineering community to respond quickly in times of need and in partnership
with scientists and engineers from other countries.

Four  funding  priorities  centering  this  year’s  request  are  designed  to  address  cur-
rent  national  challenges  and  strengthen  NSF’s  core  research  investments.  They  in-
clude:  (1)  Strengthening  core  disciplinary  research;  (2)  Providing  broadly  accessible
cyberinfrastructure  and  world-class  research  facilities;  (3)  Broadening  participation
in  the  science  and  engineering  workforce;  and  (4)  Sustaining  organizational  excel-
lence in NSF management practices.

This  year’s  investments  will  strengthen  the  core  disciplines  that  empower  every
step  of  the  process  from  discovery  at  the  frontier  to  the  development  of  products,
processes,  and  technologies  that  fuel  the  economy.  At  the  same  time,  NSF’s  invest-
ments  will  enable  increasing  connections  and  cross-fertilization  among  disciplines.
NSF’s  focus  on  a  clear  set  of  priorities  will  help  the  Nation  meet  new  challenges
and take advantage of promising opportunities, while at the same time spurring the
growth  and  prosperity  needed  to  secure  the  Nation’s  long-term  fiscal  balance.  The
FY  2006  budget  will  emphasize  investments  that  address  established  interagency
research  priorities,  meet  critical  needs  identified  by  the  science  and  engineering
community,  and  advance  the  fundamental  knowledge  that  strengthens  the  Nation’s
base of innovation and progress. NSF will respond to these challenges by supporting
the  best  people,  ideas,  and  tools  in  the  science  and  engineering  enterprise,  and  by
employing the best practices in organizational excellence.
Research and Related Activities Account

For FY 2006, total funding for NSF’s Research and Related Activities account in-
creases by $113 million—nearly three percent—to $4.33 billion. This increase large-
ly reflects NSF efforts to strengthen fundamental research in the core scientific dis-
ciplines  as  well  as  promote  emerging  areas  of  research.  The  FY  2006  portfolio  bal-
ances  research  in  established  disciplines  with  research  in  emerging  areas  of  oppor-
tunity  and  cross-disciplinary  projects.  The  most  fertile  opportunities  sometimes  lie
in novel approaches or a collaborative mix of disciplines.

Maintaining  a  strong  and  robust  core  is  critical  during  such  a  budget  climate  as
certain segments of the academic community rely heavily on NSF funding. In many
scientific  disciplines,  NSF  is  a  major  source  of  federal  funding  to  academic  institu-
tions, including mathematics (77 percent), computer sciences (86 percent), the social
sciences  (49  percent),  the  environmental  sciences  (50  percent),  engineering  (45  per-
cent) and the physical sciences (39 percent).

Research,  however,  is  only  part  of  the  NSF  equation.  Training  the  Nation’s  next
generation  of  scientists  and  engineers  is  another  key  component  of  NSF’s  mission,

52

and  critical  for  maintaining  economic  prosperity  and  global  competitiveness.  Here,
we  are  finding  ways  to  leverage  our  resources.  For  example,  as  we  strengthen  our
core disciplinary research programs, we will continue to encourage the types of part-
nerships  between  researchers  and  students  that  provide  hands-on  experience  while
ensuring  that  future  generations  gain  the  skills,  knowledge  and  insight  that  come
from working at the frontier of discovery.
Providing  Broadly  Accessible  Cyberinfrastructure  and  World-Class  Re-

search Facilities

Twenty-first  century  researchers  and  the  students  who  will  bring  new  skills  into
the workforce rely on cutting edge tools. In FY 2006, NSF is placing a high priority
on investments in cyberinfrastructure and in unique, widely shared research equip-
ment and facilities.

An infrastructure of power grids, telephone systems, roads, bridges and rail lines
buttressed  this  nation’s  industrial  economy  and  allowed  it  to  prosper.  However,
cyberinfrastructure—a  networked  system  of  distributed  computer  information  and
communication technology—is the lynchpin of today’s knowledge based economy. In
FY 2006, NSF cyberinfrastructure investments total $509 million, an increase of $36
million (7.6 percent) over the FY 2005 level.

investments 

Modeling,  simulation,  visualization,  data  storage  and  communication  are  rapidly
transforming  all  areas  of  research  and  education.  NSF 
in
cyberinfrastructure support a wide mix of projects and encourage participation from
broad  segments  of  the  research  community  that  rely  on  such  technology  as  they
tackle  increasingly  complex  scientific  questions.  Thanks  to  cyberinfrastructure  and
information systems, today’s scientific tool kit includes distributed systems of hard-
ware, software, databases and expertise that can be accessed in person or remotely.
In  fact,  programs  such  as  Teragrid,  a  multi-year  effort  to  create  the  world’s  largest
distributed  infrastructure  for  open  scientific  research,  are  specifically  designed  to
transcend geographic boundaries and accelerate virtual collaborations.

NSF  is  also  increasing  funding  for  the  Major  Research  Equipment  and  Facilities
Construction  by  $76  million  or  44  percent,  in  FY  2006  for  a  total  of  $250  million.
There  are  no  new  starts,  but  we  will  continue  to  fund  ongoing  projects.  Work  will
proceed  on  five  major  facilities  that  will  serve  a  spectrum  of  the  science  and  engi-
neering  community.  These  include  world-class  astronomy,  physics,  and  geosciences
observatories identified as the highest priorities for advancing science and engineer-
ing.

• The  Atacama  Large  Millimeter  Array  (ALMA),  in  Chile,  is  a  model  of  inter-
national collaboration. It will be the world’s largest, most sensitive radio tele-
scope.

• The  EarthScope  facility  is  a  multi-purpose  array  of  instruments  and  observ-
atories  that  will  greatly  expand  the  observational  capabilities  of  the  Earth
Sciences  and  permit  us  to  advance  our  understanding  of  the  structure,  evo-
lution and dynamics of the North American continent.

• Ice  Cube,  the  world’s  first  high-energy  neutrino  observatory  will  be  located

under the ice at the South Pole.

• RSVP,  the  Rare  Symmetry  Violating  Processes  Project  will  enable  cutting
edge  physics  experiments  to  study  fundamental  properties  of  nature.  Studies
will probe questions ranging from the origins of our physical world to the na-
ture of dark matter.

• SODV, the Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel, is a state-of-the-art ship that will
be  a  cornerstone  of  a  new  international  scientific  ocean  drilling  program.
Ocean  core  sediment  and  rock  collected  by  the  vessel  will  help  investigators
explore the planet’s geological history and probe changes in the earth’s oceans
and climate.

Additionally, In FY 2006, NSF will assume the responsibility, from the U.S. Coast
Guard,  for  funding  the  costs  of  icebreakers  that  support  scientific  research  in  polar
regions; $48 million was transferred for those purposes.
Broadening Participation

To feed our knowledge-based economy, the Nation needs to capitalize on all of its
available  talent  to  produce  a  workforce  of  skilled  technologists,  scientists  and  engi-
neers.  That  means  developing  the  largely  untapped  potential  of  those  under-rep-
resented  in  the  science  and  engineering  workforce—minorities,  women  and  persons
with  disabilities.  It  also  means  supporting  science  education  and  training  in  all  re-
gions of the country—not just at large Universities or in a handful of states.

53

To  achieve  these  goals,  the  FY  2006  Request  maintains  a  total  investment  of  al-
most $400 million. Funding will be targeted to programs with a proven track record
of progress in these areas. Included in this is $8 million in additional support from
the research directorates that will supplement the Education and Human Resources
Account  to  help  achieve  our  goal  of  broadening  science  and  engineering  participa-
tion.  Working  closely  with  the  directorates  offers  a  dual  benefit  of  providing  edu-
cational opportunities and hands-on research experience to prepare students for the
21st century workforce.

NSF will invest $396.5 million in a range of programs with proven track records.
Several  highly  successful  programs  for  broadening  participation—the  Louis  Stokes
Alliances  for  Minority  Participation,  the  Alliances  for  Graduate  Education  and  the
Professoriate,  the  Centers  for  Research  Excellence  in  Science  and  Technology
(CREST), Robert Noyce Scholarship program, STEM Talent Expansion Program and
EPSCoR—just  to  name  a  few,  are  secured  in  this  request.  Each  of  these  serve  as
models  for  integrating  educational  and  research  resources  to  improve  recruitment
and retention in science and engineering to all sectors of our diverse population.
Sustaining Organizational Excellence in NSF Management Practices

NSF  directly  supports  over  210,000  scientists,  educators  and  students  and  proc-
esses  over  40,000  proposals  a  year.  Balancing  the  needs  of  a  growing,  increasingly
complex portfolio with new requirements for e-business practices, security, account-
ability,  and  award  oversight  presents  a  challenge.  NSF  sets  high  standards  for  its
business  practices  and  strives  to  create  an  agile,  innovative  organization  through
state-of-the-art business conduct and continual review. In order to meet these man-
agement goals, NSF will be increasing funding for activities that advance organiza-
tional  excellence  by  $46  million,  to  a  total  of  $336  million.  In  addition  to  critically
needed  upgrades  to  our  information  technology  infrastructure,  this  increase  will
allow  for  the  recruitment  of  25  full-time  employees—23  for  NSF  and  one  each  for
the National Science Board and the Office of the Inspector General—which will im-
prove our ability to manage our increasingly complex portfolio.

Expanding  our  e-government  systems  and  the  implementing  of  our  ongoing  busi-

ness analysis recommendations are high priorities for FY 2006.

Over the past two years, as part of the Administrations Program Assessment Rat-
ing Tool, NSF has worked with OMB to rate eight of our investment categories. All
of these areas have received the highest rating of Effective. As such, NSF programs
fall within the top 15 percent of 600 government programs evaluated to date.
Crosscutting Activities

Beyond our budget priorities lie dozens of programs and initiatives that cut across
NSF  directorates  and  enrich  the  overall  science  and  research  enterprise.  NSF  sets
priorities  based  on  a  continual  dialogue  and  exchange  of  ideas  with  the  research
community,  NSF  management  and  staff  and  the  National  Science  Board.  Programs
are initiated based on several criteria: intellectual merit, broader impacts of the re-
search, balance across disciplines and synergy with research in other agencies. The
Committee  of  Visitors  process  ensures  a  continuous  evaluation  of  our  merit  review
process  and  feedback  on  how  NSF  programs  are  performing.  In  FY  2006,  NSF  will
emphasize four crosscutting areas.

Crosscutting  areas  of  emerging  opportunity:  Over  several  years,  NSF  has  funded
exceptionally promising interdisciplinary efforts aimed at advancing our knowledge,
addressing  national  needs,  and  probing  the  grand  challenges  of  science.  The  FY
2006 request maintains or increases FY 2005 levels of funding for the following pri-
ority  areas:  $84  million  for  Biocomplexity  in  the  Environment,  $243  million  for
Nanoscale  Science  and  Engineering,  $89  million  for  the  Mathematical  Sciences  Pri-
ority Area and $39 million for Human and Social Dynamics.

International  Collaborations:  Science  and  engineering  research  are  increasingly
global  endeavors.  International  partnerships  are  critical  to  the  United  States  in
maintaining a competitive edge, capitalizing on global opportunities, and addressing
global  problems.  The  Office  of  International  Science  and  Engineering’s  recent  move
to the director’s office, and the budget request reflects this important trend. The FY
2006 budget provides $35 million for NSF’s Office of International Science and Engi-
neering.

The  recent  Indian  Ocean  Tsunami  disaster  represents  the  finest  in  international
cooperation—and  clearly  demonstrates  an  international  desire  to  develop  scientific
methods  for  natural  disaster  prediction  and  ways  to  reduce  losses  when  such  cata-
strophic  events  do  inevitably  occur.  A  network  of  more  than  128  sensors—which
NSF  has  a  20-year  investment  in—recorded  shock  waves  from  the  recent  earth-
quake as they traveled around the earth. This network is the primary international
source of data for earthquake location and tsunami warning and its data forged the

critical  core  of  the  early  knowledge  of  this  event.  Within  days  of  the  disaster  NSF
research  teams  deployed  to  the  region  to  gather  critical  data  before  it  was  lost  to
nature  and  reconstruction.  Their  work  will  help  scientists  and  engineers  better  un-
derstand  the  warning  signs  of  natural  disasters,  the  design  of  safer  coastal  struc-
tures,  the  development  of  early  warning  and  response  systems,  and  effective  steps
for disaster recovery.

Interagency  Initiatives:  NSF  will  continue  to  play  a  lead  role  in  interagency  col-
laborations to address national needs and take advantage of economic growth oppor-
tunities. In FY 2006, NSF investments in the National Nanotechnology Initiative in-
crease  by  $6  million  over  FY  2005  levels  to  total  $344  million.  NSF  participation
in the Networking Information Technology Research and Development initiative will
increase  to  $803  million—$8  million  over  the  FY  2005  level.  The  NSF  contribution
to the Climate Change Science Program decreases slightly to $197 million.

Homeland Security Activities: The FY 2006 Request includes a $2 million increase
for  government-wide  efforts  in  homeland  security  research  and  development.  This
$344  million  investment  will  strengthen  NSF’s  commitment  to  cyber  security  by
supporting  innovations  to  secure  today’s  computer  and  networking  systems,  embed
cyber  security  into  future  systems  and  preparing  tomorrow’s  workforce  with  state-
of-the-art security skills.
Conclusion

Mr.  Chairman,  I’ve  only  touched  upon  the  variety  and  richness  of  the  NSF  port-
folio.  NSF  research  and  education  efforts  contribute  greatly  to  the  Nation’s  innova-
tion economy and help keep America at the forefront of science and engineering. At
the  same  time,  NSF  supported  researchers  produce  leading  edge  discoveries  that
serve society and spark the public’s curiosity and interest. Extraordinary discoveries
coming  from  dozens  of  NSF  programs  and  initiatives  are  enriching  the  entire
science and engineering enterprise, and making education fun, exciting and achieve-
ment-oriented.  In  fact,  just  this  month,  two  of  the  most  widely-read  and  e-mailed
stories  from  the  national  press  were  the  discoveries  of  NSF-supported  researchers.
In  one,  scientists  using  new  bio-bar-code  technology  created  a  detection  method
for  a  protein  implicated  in  Alzheimer’s  disease.  It’s  the  first  test  designed  for  use
in  living  patients  and  holds  promise  for  diagnosing  Alzheimer’s  at  an  early  stage.
In  the  second  development,  scientists  generated  an  entirely  new  classification  sys-
tem  for  the  brains  of  birds  based  on  recent  studies  showing  that  birds  are  much
closer  in  cognitive  ability  to  mammals  than  previously  thought.  The  new  scheme
will affect thousands of scientists, and help merge research efforts on both birds and
mammal.  These  two  examples,  fresh  off  the  press,  illustrate  NSF’s  motto  ‘‘Where
Discoveries Begin.’’

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  hope  that  this  brief  overview
conveys to you the extent of NSF’s commitment to advancing science and technology
in the national interest. I am very aware and appreciative of the Committee’s long-
standing bipartisan support for NSF. I look forward to working with you in months
ahead, and would be happy to respond to any questions that you have.

STATEMENT OF MR. THEODORE W. KASSINGER, DEPUTY

SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

Mr.  KASSINGER.  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Gordon,  members  of  the
Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today on the Presi-
dent’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  for  research  and  develop-
ment at the Department of Commerce.

This  Committee  is  a  constant  and  strong  voice  for  the  science
and  technology  community.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work
with  you  to  ensure  that  America  remains  the  world  leader  in
science and technology.

The  Commerce  Department  has  many  diverse  responsibilities,
but  collectively  our  programs  constitute  one  of  the  Nation’s  great
science  enterprises.  The  President’s  budget  request  for  fiscal  year
2006  reflects  his  strong  commitment  to  the  Department’s  science
and technology programs.

Those  programs  continue  to  demonstrate  remarkable  creativity.
For  example,  NIST  scientists  recently  created  a  new  form  of  mat-
ter, called a fermionic condensate, that could help unlock the mys-
teries of superconductivity, a phenomenon with the potential to im-
prove  energy  efficiency.  Other  scientists  developed  a  series  of  clin-
ical  standards  that  will  help  make  diagnosing  heart  attacks  more
precise  and  demonstrated  a  low-power,  extremely  sensitive  mag-
netic sensor about the size of a grain of rice.

NOAA also remains at the forefront of science in the public inter-
est.  NOAA  aircraft  covered  more  than  100,000  nautical  miles  of
track  lines  and  deployed  over  1,200  drops  into  storms  during  the
busy 2004 hurricane season. NOAA commissioned the U.S. Climate
Reference  Network,  which  now  contains  72  stations  across  the
country,  to  reduce  uncertainty  of  long-term  temperature  and  pre-
cipitation trends. In this past summer, NOAA led hundreds of gov-
ernment  and  university  scientists  from  across  the  country  and
western Europe in the largest air quality and climate study to date.
The  world-class  caliber  of  the  Commerce  Department  scientists
and  engineers  was  recognized  this  past  year  through  numerous
prestigious publications and awards. For just two examples, Susan
Solomon,  a  NOAA  atmospheric  scientist,  was  awarded  the  2004
Blue Planet Prize for her pioneering work in identifying the mecha-

nism  that  produces  the  Antarctic  ozone  hole  and  contributions  to-
wards  the  protection  of  the  ozone  layer.  NIST  researcher,  Deborah
Gin,  was  selected  as  both  the  Research  Leader  of  the  Year  by  Sci-
entific  American  Magazine  and  is  the  winner  of  the  Service  to
America Medal for Science and Environment, a prestigious national
award  recognizing  excellence  among  America’s  federal  public  serv-
ants.

The Department’s fiscal year 2006 budget request supports these
researchers  and  other—and  ongoing  initiatives  while  seeking  fur-
ther  to  provide  the  Nation  with  a  strong  foundation  for  a  healthy
economy, enhanced competitiveness, and an improved quality of life
for all Americans.

Mr.  Chairman,  with  that  overview,  let  me  summarize  the  high-
lights  of  the  proposed  budget  requests,  beginning  with  the  Tech-
nology Administration.

For  fiscal  year  2006,  the  Administration  requests  $536  million
for TA, including $4.2 million for the Office of the Under Secretary
and  $532  million  for  NIST.  Of  the  NIST  request,  $420.6  million  is
for laboratory programs, a 12.6 percent increase over the fiscal year
2005  appropriation.  These  programs  provide  U.S.  industry  in  the
science and technology community with the measurement capabili-
ties, standards, evaluated reference data, and test methods needed
to  support  innovation  and  to  improve  quality  in  virtually  all  tech-
nology-intensive sectors.

Among other things, the fiscal year 2006 request proposes an ad-
ditional $40 million in funding for three areas that target pressing
national  priorities.  These  include  increases  in  advances  in  manu-
facturing  with  components  addressing  nanomanufacturing,  meas-
urements  and  standards  for  homeland  security,  and  new  measure-
ment horizons for the U.S. economy and science.

Turning  to  NOAA,  for  fiscal  year  2006,  the  Administration  re-
quest $3.6 billion. These funds will allow NOAA to advance our un-
derstanding  of  our  marine  and  atmospheric  resources,  and  in  so
doing,  will  help  sustain  this  country’s  economic  vitality  and  envi-
ronmental health. NOAA is leading efforts to better understand the
complex interactions on our planet through the development of the
Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems,  GEOSS.  Our  fiscal
year  2006  budget  request  includes  increases  of  approximately  $95
million to support the requirements of GEOSS.

Included in this effort is $10 million to expand the U.S. Tsunami
Warning  Network.  NOAA  will  deploy  32  new  advanced  technology
buoys  as  part  of  a  fully-operational  tsunami  warning  system  by
mid-2007.  The  new  system  will  provide  the  United  States  with
nearly  100  percent  detection  capability  for  a  U.S.  coastal  tsunami,
allowing  notification  to  local  managers  within  minutes.  The  new
system will also expand monitoring capabilities throughout the en-
tire  Pacific  and  Caribbean  basins,  providing  tsunami  warning  for
regions bordering half of the world’s oceans.

To  implement  the  President’s  U.S.  Ocean  Action  Plan,  the  Ad-
ministration’s  request  includes  significant  resources  for  NOAA’s
ocean  and  coastal  programs  as  well  as  fisheries  and  protected  spe-
cies  activities.  We  request  more  than  $1  billion  for  these  ongoing
programs, including approximately $60 million to address state and
regional  ecosystem  research  priorities  at  the  National  Sea  Grant

College Program, $23 million in support of the NOAA Ocean Explo-
ration  Program,  $33  million  for  building  a  new  fisheries  research
vessel, and $25 million for fishery stock assessment.

Mr.  Chairman,  that  completes  my  statement.  Thank  you,  once
again,  for  your  continued  support.  And  of  course,  I  would  be
pleased to take any questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Kassinger follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEODORE W. KASSINGER

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to join you today as
we  examine  the  Administration’s  budget  request  for  research  and  development  at
the  Department  of  Commerce  and  the  Department’s  role  in  reinforcing  America’s
technological leadership. I want to thank the Committee, especially Chairman Boeh-
lert, for your continued support and leadership on innovation issues, as well as your
support  for  NOAA’s  part  in  the  Administration’s  tsunami  initiative.  You  have  been
a  constant  and  strong  voice  for  the  science  and  technology  community.  I  look  for-
ward to continuing our work together with you and the other Members of the Com-
mittee  to  ensure  that  America  remains  the  world  leader  in  the  science  and  tech-
nology field.
INTRODUCTION

The Department of Commerce works to create the conditions for economic growth
and opportunity for all Americans by promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, com-
petitiveness,  and  stewardship.  We  provide  tools  to  help  maximize  U.S.  competitive-
ness and enable economic growth for American industries, workers, and consumers.
Of  particular  importance  to  this  committee  is  the  work  that  Commerce  does  in  fos-
tering  America’s  science  and  technological  leadership  by  conducting  basic  research
and  experimentation,  enhancing  technical  standards,  advancing  measurement
science, and promoting environmental stewardship.

Maintaining  America’s  technological  leadership  is  important  not  just  for  our  na-
tion’s national security, but also to ensure continued U.S. economic growth. Science
and  technology  are  the  pistons  that  help  propel  the  American  engine  of  prosperity.
This Administration’s commitment to science and technology continues to foster the
conditions  for  both  economic  growth  and  employment  opportunity.  These  invest-
ments  in  science  and  technology  provide  the  catalyst  that  enables  private  enter-
prises  to  provide  our  nation  and  our  people  with  good  jobs,  a  better  quality  of  life,
and inventions that have established our national identity.

The  President  understands  the  opportunity  science  and  technology  provide  to  en-
hance  the  lives  of  all  Americans.  The  President’s  focus  in  the  area  of  science  and
technology  is  reflected  in  the  Department  of  Commerce  R&D  portfolio.  The  Com-
merce  budget  maintains  substantial  R&D  investments  in  two  of  our  bureaus,  the
Technology Administration (TA) (which includes the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service) and the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The overall FY 2006 budg-
et request for TA is $536.2 million, a small increase over our FY 2005 request. How-
ever,  the  request  represents  an  increase  of  over  $47  million  from  the  FY  2005  en-
acted  amount  for  NIST’s  core  laboratory  programs,  the  NIST  programs  most  effec-
tive and necessary in supporting the fundamental scientific understanding and tech-
nological needs of U.S.-based businesses, American workers, and the domestic econ-
omy.  For  FY  2006,  we  will  be  seeking  program  increases  of  $19.6  million  for  ad-
vanced manufacturing research, $3.0 million for measurements and standards work
related to homeland security, $17.2 million for measurement infrastructure improve-
ments, and $35.4 million for high priority facilities modernization and maintenance
needs.  For  NOAA,  we  are  requesting  $3.6  billion,  an  increase  of  $205  million  from
our  FY  2005  request.  Of  the  increase,  $94.7  million  will  support  requirements  to
build an integrated Earth observing system.

While  the  focus  of  this  testimony  is  on  TA/NIST  and  NOAA,  I  should  also  note
that  the  United  States  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  (USPTO)  and  the  National
Telecommunications  and  Information  Administration  (NTIA)  play  significant  roles
in promoting the Department of Commerce’s technology goals. USPTO ensures that
the intellectual property system contributes to a strong global economy, encourages
investment in innovation, and fosters entrepreneurial spirit. NTIA works to spur in-
novation  by  promoting  efficient  use  of  federal  radio  spectrum  and  encouraging  the
development  and  implementation  of  new  and  emerging  telecommunications  tech-
nologies, helping consumers and creating jobs.

The  Technology  Administration  and  its  various  components  seek  to  maximize
technology’s contribution to economic growth, high-wage job creation, and the social
well-being  of  the  United  States.  TA  and  NIST  not  only  serve  as  advocates  for  tech-
nological innovation but also analyze the factors that affect our competitiveness and
develop the tools needed to enhance productivity, trade, and, in the end, the quality
of  life  for  all  Americans.  In  addition,  NIST  is  engaged  in  critical  research  in  high-
priority areas of technological innovation such as nanotechnology, information tech-
nology,  biotechnology,  and  manufacturing  technology.  NIST  is  also  conducting  re-
search in response to the World Trade Center tragedy and the February 2003 night-
club  fire  in  Rhode  Island  to  better  prepare  facility  owners,  contractors,  architects,
engineers,  emergency  responders,  and  regulatory  authorities  to  respond  to  future
disasters.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s mission is to understand
and predict changes in the Earth’s environment, as well as to conserve and manage
coastal  and  marine  resources  to  meet  our  nation’s  economic,  social,  and  environ-
mental needs. The work performed at NOAA touches the daily lives of every person
in the United States and in much of the world. The agency

• provides weather, water, and climate services;
• manages and protects marine resources ecosystems;
• conducts atmospheric, climate, and ecosystems research;
• promotes  efficient  and  environmentally  safe  commerce  and  transportation;
• provides emergency response and vital information in support of homeland se-

and

curity.

In  addition  to  using  science  and  technology  to  create  jobs  and  improve  economic
prosperity,  the  Department  is  also  directing  resources  toward  disaster  prevention,
to better understand and minimize the loss of life and property from disasters.

In  January  2005,  the  Administration  announced  that  the  U.S.  tsunami  detection
and  warning  capabilities  would  be  expanded  as  a  contribution  to  the  Global  Earth
Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS).  NOAA’s  advanced  technology  will  create
an  expanded  tsunami  warning  system  that  is  expected  to  be  fully  operational  by
2007. These programs will help NOAA improve public safety and economic security
in the United States and throughout the world.

Currently, NOAA leads the Nation and world in ocean and ecosystem science, pol-
icy  and  management.  In  December  2004,  the  Administration  released  the  ‘‘U.S.
Ocean Action Plan,’’ a response to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy’s report en-
titled, ‘‘An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century.’’ Working under the leadership of
the Council on Environmental Quality, and with several other agencies, NOAA sub-
stantially assisted in the development of this action plan. NOAA will play a key role
in implementing many of the ocean policy measures that it contains, including sup-
porting  the  establishment  of  a  coordinated  ocean  governance  structure.  Consistent
with this approach, the Administration continues to support Commerce’s leadership
role  in  oceans  policy  and  activities  by  promoting  passage  of  a  NOAA  Organic  Act.
We look forward to discussing this with you further when you consider this legisla-
tion.

NOAA’s  global  leadership  also  extends  to  monitoring  the  planet  through  the  de-
velopment of the GEOSS. The GEOSS will provide NOAA and others with the tools
to  better  understand  our  planet  through  an  integrated,  comprehensive,  and  sus-
tained Earth observation program.

NOAA  leads  the  Administration’s  interagency  Climate  Change  Science  Program.
As needs for water, climate, and air quality information increase worldwide, NOAA
has  been  working  to  improve  our  understanding  of  climate  and  helping  develop
products and services that provide useful information for national and regional man-
agement decisions. One example of this is the National Integrated Drought Informa-
tion System (NIDIS), which provides early drought warning on a regional level.
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FY 2006 BUDGET REQUEST
Technology Administration Programs

The  mission  of  the  Technology  Administration  (TA),  which  includes  the  Under
Secretary of Commerce for Technology and two major components, the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information
Service  (NTIS),  is  to  maximize  technology’s  contribution  to  America’s  economic
growth.  In  addition,  the  agency  seeks  to  encourage  the  development  of  the  techno-
logical  infrastructure  required  to  support  U.S.  industry  through  the  21st  Century;
to foster the development, diffusion, and adoption of new technologies; and to create
a business environment conducive to innovation.

59

The  Department  requests  $4.2  million  for  the  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  for
Technology  (TA/US).  The  Administration  proposes  to  streamline  the  administrative
and  policy  operations  of  the  Technology  Administration’s  Office  of  the  Under  Sec-
retary.  The  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary,  in  its  technology  policy  leadership  role,
will continue to provide policy guidance to the Secretary of Commerce and the Tech-
nology  Administration’s  component  agencies,  serve  as  an  interagency  leader  on  key
Administration  technology  initiatives,  lead  the  National  Medal  of  Technology  Pro-
gram, participate in the President’s National Science and Technology Council’s Com-
mittee on Technology, promote Administration policies for innovation and industrial
competitiveness  within  and  outside  government,  and  provide  leadership  within  the
Department  as  chair  of  the  Commerce  Coordinating  Council  for  Technology.  The
Under  Secretary’s  office  will  continue  to  coordinate  the  civilian  science  and  tech-
nology  efforts  of  federal  agencies  and  help  to  shape  federal  civilian  R&D  priorities
after  considering  the  views  of  industry.  The  Under  Secretary  will  continue  to  pro-
vide  counsel  to  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  on  all  matters  affecting  innovation,  and
coordinate with counterpart offices in the trade and economic agencies to create uni-
fied, integrated trade and technology policies.
National Institute of Standards and Technology

NIST’s  proposed  $532  million  budget  request  for  FY  2006  focuses  the  Institute’s
resources  on  addressing  the  critical  national  priorities  that  can  best  be  served  by
the  Institute’s  unique  cross-disciplinary  expertise  in  science  and  technology.  As
noted  above,  the  request  includes  a  $47  million  increase  for  NIST’s  core  laboratory
programs.  The  NIST  budget  request  for  FY  2006  also  reflects  the  President’s  con-
cern for focusing intently on other national priorities. While the request covers stra-
tegic investments in Institute capabilities, it still helps meet the President’s overall
budget  goals  by  reducing  NIST’s  budget  more  than  $163  million  compared  with  FY
2005  appropriations,  accomplished  by  shifting  resources  from  lower-priority  pro-
grams.
Advances in Manufacturing ($19.6 million increase)

The  Department  is  requesting  a  $19.6  milllion  increase  for  NIST  in  Advanced
Manufacturing  research.  The  growth  of  the  global  economy—the  rapid  exchange  of
goods and technologies—has placed unprecedented pressures on the Nation’s manu-
facturing  sector.  Most  observers  agree  that  if  the  United  States  is  to  compete  suc-
cessfully,  it  must  be  on  the  basis  of  sustained,  superior  innovation  in  all  aspects  of
manufacturing. We must lead the pack. Innovation must go further than new prod-
ucts  and  processes,  however.  The  United  States  must  innovate  in  the  business  of
manufacturing, improving efficiencies and continuing the productivity increases that
have sustained the manufacturing sector since the Second World War.

• National Nanomanufacturing and Nanometrology Facility (N3F) ($10 million).
The largest major element of NIST’s advanced manufacturing initiative is the
development  of  a  national  ‘‘user  facility’’  for  nanotechnology  research  in  the
AML. The N3F will give qualified collaborators from industry and government
access  to  the  state-of-the-art 
laboratories  of  the  AML,  the  existing
nanotechnology expertise of the seven NIST laboratories, and mechanisms for
partnering on nanotech projects. Together with public and private sector part-
ners,  NIST  will  use  the  N3F  to  investigate  the  fundamental  physics,  mecha-
nisms  and  metrology  to  manipulate  matter  atom-by-atom,  in  order  to  build
perfectly  defined  nanostructures  with  predefined  electronic,  mechanical,  and
quantum properties. N3F will offer U.S. industry in a single institution an un-
matched measurement infrastructure to compete at the nanoscale.
• Nanomanufacturing  research  ($4  million).  As  manufacturing  processes  and
products  become  ever  more  sophisticated,  the  key  battlefields  of  21st-century
manufacturing  will  depend  more  and  more  on  excellence  in  measurement
technology. This is true across the board in manufacturing, but nowhere more
so  than  in  the  rapidly  developing  field  of  nanomanufacturing,  where  it  can
be necessary to locate, track and manipulate individual molecules and atoms.
NIST’s  nanomanufacturing  research  effort  will  concentrate  on  delivering  the
critical  measurement  technology  and  standards  infrastructure  across  the
broad spectrum of science and engineering that is ‘‘nanotechnology,’’ including
nanodevices  (mechanical  and  electronic),  nanomagnetics,  nanomanipulation,
and nanoscale materials characterization. NIST is uniquely positioned for this
work  not  only  because  of  its  long  history  of  expertise  in  measurement  re-
search,  but  also  because  of  the  recent  completion  of  its  Advanced  Measure-
ment  Laboratory  (AML),  which  offers  a  unique  collection  of  state-of-the-art
precision measurement labs.

• Manufacturing enterprise integration ($1.6 million). America’s large manufac-
turers  are  globally  distributed  enterprises.  They  rely  on  a  system  of  small
manufacturers,  part  suppliers,  shippers,  and  raw  materials  producers  orga-
nized  in  extended  enterprises  called  supply  chains.  Successfully  managing
production  throughout  the  supply  chain  is  critical  to  the  competitiveness  of
these  extended  enterprises.  Production  costs  are  no  longer  the  major  cost
drivers in these global supply chains—the dominant factor is the cost of engi-
neering and business activities. But many small manufacturers not equipped
to do business in these sophisticated, distributed enterprises are being left out
and  are  in  danger  of  failure.  One  independent  economic  study  commissioned
by NIST shows that the automotive supply chain alone loses $1 billion annu-
ally  due  to  inefficient  engineering  and  business  data  exchanges.  NIST  pro-
poses  a  wide-ranging  program  to  work  with  U.S.  manufacturers  to  create  a
‘‘roadmap’’  for  the  development  of  open  standards  for  enterprise  integration,
to develop and test standards and standard conformance tests, and to ensure
that  they  are  integrated  and  consistent  with  developing  international  stand-
ards.
• Expanding access to global markets through measurements and standards ($4
million).  Even  with  superior  technology,  American  manufacturers  can  be  ef-
fectively locked out of profitable foreign markets through artificial barriers of
local standards and regulations. Knocking down these barriers—or preventing
them  from  being  raised  in  the  first  place—is  an  issue  of  international  stand-
ards,  harmonization,  and  measurement  compatibility,  again,  part  of  NIST’s
core  expertise.  Eighty  percent  of  global  merchandise  trade  is  influenced  by
testing  and  other  measurement-related  requirements  of  regulations  and
standards.  U.S.  manufacturers  need  standards  and  calibrations  to  be  aligned
with international standards to give them seamless access to foreign markets.
In addition, NIST monitors foreign and international standards efforts for po-
tential  impact  on  U.S.  exports.  NIST  will  develop  leading-edge  measurement
capabilities  for  key  technologies  and  new,  more  efficient  ways  to  deliver  the
highly accurate measurements needed by U.S. industry to create and market
products  based  upon  new  technologies.  NIST  will  continue  its  efforts  to  sup-
port  access  to  foreign  markets  through  technical  leadership  and  coordination
of  key  trade-related  documentary  standards  activities  in  specific  technology
sectors.

Measurements and Standards for Homeland Security ($3 million increase)

Measurements  and  standards  are  increasingly  understood  to  be  an  important
component of homeland security, whether in helping to mitigate the effects of disas-
ters,  both  natural  and  man-made,  or  in  helping  to  ensure  the  reliability  of  the  new
high-tech  tools  being  brought  to  bear  in  the  war  on  terrorism.  NIST  will  continue
to coordinate its work closely with the Department of Homeland Security and other
agencies.

• Improved standards and guidelines for first responders and buildings ($1 mil-
lion).  NIST  has  long  been  recognized  for  its  contributions  to  public  safety  in
building  technology—the  development  of  test  methods  and  engineering  data
to make buildings safer and more resistant to earthquakes and fire, for exam-
ple—but the increased risk of terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001, has
added  to  natural  disasters  a  new  dimension  of  deadly,  human-engineered
threats.  A  private-sector  coalition  representing  the  key  industry,  standards,
codes  and  professional  organizations  has  worked  with  NIST  to  establish  a
comprehensive  program  to  identify  and  address  high  priority  national  needs
for  building  safety.  Key  areas  include  increased  structural  integrity,  stand-
ards  for  first-responder  equipment,  enhanced  fire  resistance  of  structures,
building  operations  in  emergencies,  and  improved  emergency  egress  and  ac-
cess.  NIST  will  expand  support  for  this  effort,  developing  the  technical  basis
for  needed  improvements  in  practice,  standards,  and  codes  for  buildings  and
for  guidelines  and  equipment  standards  for  first  responders.  The  Institute
will  develop  simulation  and  decision-support  tools  and  technical  guidelines,
conduct  trial  designs  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  technical  solutions,
and recommend specific proposals for needed changes to codes and standards.
• Biometrics  ($1  million).  Biometrics—positive  identification  of  individuals
based  on  physical  characteristics—is  a  critical  tool  in  the  war  on  terrorism.
As  terrorist  and  criminal  databases  become  larger  and  larger,  it  is  more  and
more  important  that  biometric  technologies  perform  accurately  and  quickly.
As  this  dynamic  technology  continues  to  evolve,  the  field  must  be  constantly
reassessed to ensure that the government is using the most accurate biomet-

ric  recognition  technology  available  for  a  given  application.  NIST  will  build
on its existing expertise in biometrics to certify facial recognition technologies
to  make  certain  that  all  requirements  for  border  security  are  met,  build  on
its  testing  program  for  determining  the  accuracy  of  new  multi-modal  biomet-
ric  systems  (those  combining  two  or  more  biometric  techniques),  and  develop
tests  and  guidelines  to  ensure  that  future  biometric  systems  are  inter-oper-
able and work efficiently in real-world applications.

New  Measurement  Horizons  for  the  U.S.  Economy  and  Science  ($17.2  million  in-

crease)

One of the most serious challenges NIST faces in its mission to provide the meas-
urement infrastructure needed by the Nation’s scientific and industrial communities
is the requirement for the relatively small Institute to stay not only abreast of but—
in  many  cases—ahead  of  rapidly  changing  developments  across  the  broad  range  of
science and technology.

• Biosystems  and  health  ($7,195,000).  The  advances  in  biology  and  bio-
technology  in  the  last  few  years—both  new  understanding  in  fields  like
genomics  and  proteomics  and  new  capabilities  and  technologies  such  as  gene
engineering  and  microarrays—constitute  a  technological  revolution  in  fields
as diverse as material science, agriculture and health care. A lack of measure-
ment  tools  for  ensuring  accuracy  and  reliability  looms  as  a  major  roadblock
that  could  prevent  promising  biotechnologies  from  achieving  their  potential
for mainstream health care applications.

in 

science 

and 

NIST  has  a  unique,  multidisciplinary  expertise  in  measurement  science
that  is  essential  in  a  field  like  biotechnology,  which  lies  at  the  interface  of
biology,  chemistry,  physics  and  mathematics.  The  Institute  also  has  a  long
history  of  working  with  the  health  care  industry  to  provide  needed  measure-
ment  technologies  and  reference  standards  ranging  from  clinical  standards
for cholesterol and glucose to DNA. Under this initiative, NIST will establish
a  systems  approach  to  identifying  and  removing  measurement-related  bar-
riers to the effective application of biotechnology in health care. The Institute
also  will  further  the  development  of  bioinformatics—the  computational  and
information  science  tools  needed  to  assemble,  organize,  summarize  and  ana-
lyze the mountains of biological data produced by these new technologies.

advances 

• Inter-operability  and  security  for  emerging  scientific  systems  ($2  million).  So-
phisticated  scientific  information  systems  are  critical  to  the  continued  com-
petitive  advantage  of  the  United  States.  The  systems  that  underlie  the  Na-
tion’s 
engineering—the
‘‘cyberinfrastructure’’—are  rapidly  expanding  in  all  directions.  Individual  in-
formation  devices—from  radio-frequency  ID  (RFID)  tags  to  ‘‘smart  dust’’  to
micro-electro-mechanical  systems  (MEMS)—are  becoming  ever  smaller,  more
capable,  and  more  ubiquitous.  At  the  other  end  of  the  scale,  system  com-
plexity—systems of systems of systems—is growing rapidly as well. It is cru-
cial  that  standards  and  measurements  for  reliability,  manageability,  inter-
operability  and  security  be  included  from  the  beginning  of  system  design  to
avoid costly retrofits.

As  part  of  this  initiative,  NIST  will  develop  the  technical  support  tools  re-
quired  to  maximize  the  performance  of  future  components,  systems  and  net-
works,  including  developing  metrics  and  standards  for  the  performance,  con-
formance and usability of complex, multi-modal, distributed scientific systems
to ensure inter-operability. NIST will also develop metrics and techniques for
characterizing  and  assessing  emerging  self-managing  system  technologies,
and  develop  mathematical  models,  measurement  techniques  and  control  sys-
tems  capable  of  detecting  and  reacting  to  emergent  behaviors  in  very-large-
scale  scientific  systems.  The  initiative  also  calls  for  NIST  to  develop  test
methods and protocols for detecting and reporting malicious tampering of sys-
tems and components.
• Quantum  processing—beyond  high-end  computing  ($4  million).  Quantum  in-
formation science, which seeks to exploit the peculiar characteristics of quan-
tum  mechanics  to  create  information  processing  systems  of  almost  unimagi-
nable  power,  is  likely  to  revolutionize  science  and  technology  on  a  scale  com-
parable  to  the  introduction  of  the  laser,  the  integrated  circuit,  and  the  com-
puter.  Currently  intractable  problems,  such  as  the  factoring  of  very  large
numbers  to  decipher  terrorist  communications,  potentially  could  be  done  in
less  than  a  second  by  a  quantum  computer.  On  the  other  hand,  quantum
cryptography could provide perfectly secure defense communications.

NIST  is  a  leader  in  fundamental  research  on  quantum  information  sys-
tems,  having  demonstrated  laboratory-scale  quantum  computing  and  quan-
tum  teleportation  systems.  There  is  also  a  need  for  a  significantly  broader
program  to  provide  the  basic  measurement  tools  and  standards  for  quantum
computing  and  communications  systems  to  support  U.S.  industry’s  research
and  development  of  quantum  systems.  Quantum  computing  also  will  require
the  development  of  whole  new  approaches  to  processor  and  memory  control,
error  management,  and  component  interconnections.  Under  this  initiative,
NIST  will  develop  a  measurement  infrastructure  and  the  fundamental  tech-
nologies  needed  to  build  prototype  quantum  processors  that  could  be  scaled
up to true quantum computers, and develop metrics for evaluating alternative
computing architectures based on quantum processing.
• Building  competence  for  advanced  measurements  ($4  million).  Since  the  late
1970s, a key element of NIST’s planning strategy has been the Building Com-
petence  for  Advanced  Measurements  Program,  a  special  research  effort  ena-
bling NIST to explore key developing areas of science and technology and es-
tablish  a  base  of  technical  expertise  on  which  to  build  future  measurement
services.  The  quantum  physics  research  of  NIST’s  two  Nobel  laureates,  the
development  of  new  cold  neutron  instrumentation  that  ultimately  led  to  the
Institute’s  unique  Cold  Neutron  Research  Facility,  and  NIST’s  Biotechnology
Division  with  its  pathbreaking  research  in  DNA  forensics  all  were  fostered
originally  by  Competence  Program  funding.  The  Competence  Program  is  an
essential  tool  giving  NIST’s  research  program  the  necessary  agility  to  adapt
to  fast-moving  scientific  developments.  The  proposed  initiative  will  allow
NIST to expand and enhance the existing Competence Program.

Facilities Improvement Plan ($32 million increase)

NIST  is  engaged  in  a  long-range  facility  modernization  program  to  make  badly
needed repairs and upgrades to its physical plant. NIST maintains about 50 special-
ized  laboratories,  offices  and  support  buildings  at  its  two  major  campuses  in  Gai-
thersburg,  Maryland  and  Boulder,  Colorado.  Most  of  the  Gaithersburg  structures
were  built  in  the  1960s  and  the  Boulder  site  is  a  decade  older.  The  aging  of  these
facilities has become a serious impediment to the Institute’s mission, hampering not
only  NIST  work  on  the  research  frontiers  of  biotechnology,  nanotechnology,  and
semiconductor technology, but even routine activities such as the calibration of pre-
cision pressure gauges used to ensure the accuracy of airplane altimeters and other
industrial  pressure  systems.  NIST  developed  a  long-range  Facilities  Improvement
Plan, as well as plans for the thorough renovation of existing structures and a main-
tenance  program  designed  to  address  long-term  maintenance  needs  and  reduce  an
extensive backlog of needed maintenance work.
Maintenance for the Advanced Measurement Laboratory ($3.4 million increase)

Completed  at  the  end  of  2003,  the  NIST  Advanced  Measurement  Laboratory
(AML)  is  one  of  the  world’s  most  sophisticated  measurement  and  standards  labora-
tories. Specialized AML labs are able to control environmental factors such as vibra-
tion,  temperature,  humidity,  and  surface  and  air  cleanliness  to  the  demands  of
NIST’s  most  advanced  research  in  areas.  In  some  labs,  for  example,  temperature
can  be  controlled  to  within  one-hundredth  of  a  degree  Celsius  across  the  entire
room.

Maintaining  and  operating  the  AML  poses  special  challenges  because  of  the  so-
phisticated  and  complex  mechanical  and  electrical  systems  needed  to  maintain  the
rigorous environmental controls. Thorough and uncompromising preventive mainte-
nance  is  required  to  keep  the  AML  operating  as  designed  and  protect  the  Nation’s
investment in this unique laboratory. If the clean room mechanical systems ever slip
from their exacting design parameters, for example, it will likely cost over $100,000
to  decontaminate  the  clean  room  and  return  it  to  service.  This  initiative  covers  the
needed increase to NIST’s research facilities budget to maintain the AML.
Baldrige National Quality Program ($5.7 million request)

NIST  also  administers  the  Baldrige  National  Quality  Program  (BNQR).  Created
by the Congress in 1987, the BNQP has established a standard for performance ex-
cellence  that  helps  U.S.  businesses  and  other  organizations  continuously  improve
their  competitiveness  and  productivity  through  rigorous  quality  and  performance
management practices.

Only  a  relative  handful  of  institutions  have  won  the  program’s  centerpiece,  the
Malcolm  Baldrige  National  Quality  Award—since  1988,  only  62  Baldrige  Awards
have  been  presented  to  59  organizations.  Nonetheless,  the  BNQP  has  had  a  perva-
sive  influence  on  U.S.  industry,  schools  and  hospitals  through  the  widespread  dis-

semination  of  Baldrige  ‘‘best  practices.’’  Many  thousands  of  organizations  use  the
Baldrige criteria internally to assess and improve their performance, deliver greater
value  to  their  customers,  and  improve  overall  organizational  effectiveness.  The
BNQP has been copied widely by state governments and other countries.

The  Baldrige  Award  originally  had  categories  for  manufacturing,  service,  and
small business. In 1999, the award was expanded to include categories in education
and  health  care.  In  2004,  the  award  was  expanded  to  include  all  non-profit  organi-
zations, including Federal, State and local government organizations.
Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership ($46.8 million request)

Since  1988,  the  Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (HMEP)  at  NIST
has  fostered  a  federal-State-local  partnership  program  to  give  small  and  medium
sized manufacturers a nationwide network of not-for-profit centers to help them be-
come more competitive and productive. HMEP centers serve all 50 States and Puer-
to  Rico,  promoting  lean  manufacturing  techniques  such  as  zero-defect  quality  pro-
grams,  and  helping  even  the  smallest  firms  tap  into  specialists  from  across  the
country with manufacturing and business expertise in plant operations and on man-
ufacturing  floors.  The  FY  2006  budget  request  will  fund  the  program  at  $46.8  mil-
lion.  At  this  level,  the  Administration  will  maintain  a  national  network  of  centers,
while focusing funding based on a center’s performance and need.
Advanced Technology Program ($0 request)

Since 1990, the Advanced Technology Program has used cost-shared awards to en-
courage  industry  investment  in  high-risk,  innovative  technology  R&D  that  promise
broad  benefits  to  the  Nation.  While  the  program  has  sponsored  successful  research
projects  over  the  years,  this  budget  proposes  terminating  the  program  in  favor  of
more  appropriate  and  higher-priority  needs  of  government  funding.  Our  budget  re-
quest reflects our belief that the NIST core laboratory programs have a much higher
priority than the ATP because they support the fundamental science and technology
needs of U.S. businesses, workers and the U.S. economy.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Programs

Americans look to NOAA for an incredible variety of services and support ranging
from  the  local  weather  forecast,  to  a  sustainable  supply  of  quality  seafood,  to  the
safe  transport  of  millions  of  tons  of  weatherborne  cargo.  NOAA  also  helps  to  keep
the  coastline  safe  and  vibrant,  and  to  maintain  detailed  research  on  the  climate
from the frozen arctic to the depths of the oceans. NOAA’s Strategic Plan highlights
focal areas for research under each of the agency’s four major cross-cutting strategic
goals:  ecosystems,  climate,  weather  and  water,  and  commerce  and  transportation.
NOAA’s FY 2006 budget request includes several initiatives that are research driv-
en  or  science  based  which  are  set  out  below  in  the  context  of  NOAA’s  four  major
strategic  goals.  I  would  like  to  begin  by  highlighting  the  Global  Earth  Observation
System  of  Systems  (GEOSS),  a  program  that  brings  together  elements  of  all  four
strategic goals.
Global Earth Observations ($94.7 million increase)

NOAA’s FY 2006 budget includes increases of approximately $94.7 million to sup-
port  requirements  to  build  an  integrated  Earth  observing  system,  the  GEOSS.  In-
cluded in these efforts is the $65.6 million requested for NOAA’s Geostationary and
Polar Orbiting Satellites, and the $9.5 million to expand the U.S. Tsunami Warning
Network.  The  new  ’system  of  systems’  will  ‘‘take  the  pulse  of  the  planet’’  by  pro-
viding  critical  scientific  data  needed  to  address  important  global  economic,  social
and  scientific  challenges.  With  this  improved  knowledge,  decision-makers  around
the world will be able to make more informed decisions regarding climate, the envi-
ronment, and a host of other economic and social issues that are affected by Earth’s
systems.
Ecosystems ($74.52 million increase)

DOC  requests  an  increase  of  $1.5  million  to  improve  the  condition  of  coral  reefs
through  support  and  implementation  of  locally  driven  three-year  action  strategies
in  order  to  translate  the  broad  national  goals  proposed  by  the  U.S.  Commission  on
Ocean Policy into action. The strategies are roadmaps for collaborative and coopera-
tive  action  among  federal,  state  or  territory  and  nongovernmental  partners  to  ad-
dress specific threats to coral reef ecosystems, including land-based sources of pollu-
tion, recreational overuse, lack of public awareness, climate change, coral bleaching,
disease, and issues addressed by fisheries management, such as over-fishing.

DOC  requests  a  net  increase  of  $5.5  million  for  economic  and  social  science  re-
search  to  expand  the  agency’s  data  collection  capabilities.  This  is  critically  impor-
tant  in  the  area  of  fishery  management.  With  the  funds  requested,  NOAA  expects

to 1) complete economic analyses on commercial harvesters for 26 Fisheries Manage-
ment  Plans  (FMP)  by  FY  2006—a  46  percent  increase  over  FY  2005  projections;  2)
complete  profiles  on  20  fishing  communities—a  threefold  increase  from  FY  2005;
and 3) estimate economic impacts on recreational and commercial fisheries that are
economically  displaced  in  20  federal  marine  managed  areas—also  a  threefold  in-
crease from FY 2005. DOC also requests $32.5 million for a fourth Fisheries Survey
Vessel (FSV 4) that will deploy state-of-the-art acoustic technologies to enhance our
ability to collect fish stocks data to protect marine mammals.

DOC  requests  $61.2  million  to  sustain  the  operations  of  the  National  Sea  Grant
College  Program  in  FY  2006  to  continue  development  of  a  system  of  regional  net-
works to organize multi-state responses to regional/ecosystem-level problems.

DOC is also requesting level funding of $22.7 million to sustain the operations of
the Ocean Exploration Program. This program seeks to increase our national under-
standing  of  unknown  or  poorly  known  ocean  systems  and  processes  by  conducting
25–30 expeditions per year. In FY 2005, the program will purchase a remotely oper-
ated vehicle (ROV) and other infrastructure for NOAA’s first designated exploration
vessel,  which  is  scheduled  for  sea  trials  in  2007.  With  this  infrastructure  in  place,
NOAA will be able to devote funding to support an expanded set of expeditions and
projects.

DOC  also  requests  an  increase  of  $2.5  million  for  the  Aquatic  Invasive  Species
(AIS)  Program.  Zebra  mussels  have  cost  the  Great  Lakes  region  $3  billion  over  the
past  decade,  and  they  are  just  one  of  hundreds  of  invasive  species  threatening  the
health of the Great Lakes ecosystem.

DOC  requests  an  increase  of  $1.6  million  for  its  Marine  Aquaculture  Program.
This  increase  will  spur  environmentally  safe  domestic  marine  aquaculture  produc-
tion,  and  help  to  offset  the  current  $7  billion  annual  U.S.  trade  deficit  in  seafood;
will  help  in  rebuilding  wild  fisheries  stocks;  and  will  enhance  job  creation  in  both
the  production  and  processing  of  fishery  products,  thereby  revitalizing  communities
devastated by collapsing fisheries industries.
Climate ($36.8 million increase)

DOC  is  requesting  additional  funds  for  its  climate  programs,  including  an  $18
million  increase  to  support  the  President’s  Climate  Change  Science  Plan.  This  in-
cludes the following initiatives:

• an increase of $3.2 million to conduct further research on the Tropical Atmos-
phere  Ocean  (TAO)  array  of  buoys  and  the  Pilot  Research  Moored  Array  of
buoys  in  the  Tropical  Atlantic  (PIRATA).  This  funding  will  expand  the  TAO
array into the Indian Ocean and support the technological development of the
next generation of moored buoys.

• $2  million  to  develop  new  climate  re-analysis  datasets  that  will  enable  us  to
explain  more  adequately  the  causes  of  observed  climate  variability  and
change.  These  datasets  will  substantially  reduce  current  uncertainty  about
historical  climate  variations  and  improve  our  ability  to  analyze  and  detect
interannual-to-decadal  variability  and  weather-climate  trends  for  the  20th
century.

• an increase of $800,000 for the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment
(RISA) program. This funding will initiate a multi-year research effort to: (1)
refine existing regional integrated research and address new issues of impor-
tance  to  decision-making  communities  in  regions  currently  served;  and  (2)
link,  in  an  integrated  manner,  climate  research  and  information  to  decision-
making  processes  in  regions  not  currently  supported  by  NOAA  to  ensure
NOAA is providing effective climate services across the Nation.

• an  increase  of  $3.5  million  to  continue  building  and  maintaining  a  global
ocean  observing  system  that  will  accurately  document  climate-scale  changes
in  ocean  heat,  carbon  and  sea  level.  This  effort  will  complete  55  percent  of
the  ocean  observing  system,  keeping  us  on  track  with  our  international  com-
mitment of completing the ocean climate observing system by 2010.

• an  increase  of  $2.1  million  for  expanded  research  efforts  in  Aerosols,  Clouds,
and  Climate  Change:  Observations  and  Predictions.  This  research  effort  is
part  of  a  multi-year  program  of  observations  to  quantify  how  aerosols  (air-
borne  fine  particles)  influence  climate  change  by  their  interactions  with
clouds.  The  observations  will  be  used  to  test,  validate,  and  improve  aerosol-
cloud  and  global  climate  models  so  that  they  more  accurately  represent  aer-
osol-cloud interactions.

• $7.5  million  to  support  other  ongoing  climate  research  programs  in  Climate
Research and Observations, Climate Operations, and Climate Data and Infor-
mation programs.

Weather and Water ($96.2 million increase)

In response to the tragedy that struck Southeast Asia on December 26, 2004, the
Administration  on  January  14,  2005,  announced  a  plan  to  commit  an  additional
$37.5  million  over  the  next  two  years  to  tsunami  research  and  preparedness  capa-
bilities. NOAA’s portion of the Administration proposal is $24 million over two fiscal
years:  $14.5  million  in  FY  2005  and  $9.5  million  in  FY  2006,  which  will  be  used
to expand the existing six buoy Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis
(DART)  system  that  forms  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Network.  The  new  funds
provide for an additional 32 DART buoys by mid-2007—seven in the Atlantic Ocean,
Caribbean Basin and Gulf of Mexico, and 25 in the Pacific Ocean. The program will
also  procure  38  new  sea  level  monitoring/tide  gauge  stations,  provide  24/7  warning
coverage  at  the  Richard  H.  Hagemeyer  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  and  the
West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, upgrade 20 seismometers used to im-
prove  tsunami  detection,  and  expand  the  TsunamiReady  program  to  improve  com-
munity preparedness.

DOC  also  requests  $4  million  to  begin  developing  a  nationwide  water  resources
forecasting  capability  that  is  integrated  and  leveraged  with  other  federal  water
agency activities, forming the basis of a national water information system. This ini-
tiative  provides  the  water  modeling  capability  to  support  the  U.S.  Commission  on
Ocean  Policy  mandate  for  a  national  water  quality  monitoring  and  prediction  sys-
tem.  Furthermore,  the  initiative  enables  NOAA  to  deliver  a  national  database  of
drought  analyses  and  predictions,  and  generate  user  friendly  Geographic  Informa-
tion  Systems  (GIS)  products  for  monitoring  drought.  The  initiative  will  provide
water users the ability to assess water availability in real time and make informed
decisions to mitigate impacts of extreme water events, such as droughts.

DOC  also  requests  $2.1  million  to  accelerate  nationwide  implementation  of  ozone
air  quality  (AQ)  forecasting  capability  from  FY  2009  to  FY  2008  and  to  deliver  an
initial  particulate  matter  forecasting  capability  by  FY  2011.  The  effect  of  poor  air
quality on the national economy is estimated at $150 billion/year from health effects
alone.  Accurate  air  quality  forecast  guidance,  provided  in  time  to  take  action,  can
realize significant savings. Due to the magnitude of this impact, even a 0.5 percent
change  due  to  air  quality  forecasting  would  have  a  significant  effect,  saving  about
$750 million a year nationally.
Commerce and Transportation ($35.1 million increase)

DOC  requests  a  total  of  $7.5  million  to  maintain  the  operations  of  the  Joint  Hy-
drographic Center, established in FY 1999 as a partnership between NOAA and the
University of New Hampshire. The Center’s activities focus on two major tasks: the
creation  of  a  learning  center  that  will  promote  and  foster  the  education  of  a  new
generation  of  hydrographers  and  ocean  mapping  scientists,  and  research  to  develop
and evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art hydrographic and ocean mapping tech-
nologies and applications.

An increase of $900,000 is requested for the South Carolina Geodetic Survey and
the California Spatial Reference Center. South Carolina’s exemplary State program
works  to  establish  horizontal  and  vertical  geodetic  control  throughout  the  State  to
allow  land  and  land-related  items  to  be  referenced  to  the  national  horizontal  and
vertical  coordinate  system.  The  Survey’s  efforts  improve  land  records  management,
engineering, land planning, and economic development. NOAA’s support of the Cali-
fornia Spatial Reference Center has enabled the State to develop a plan to establish
and maintain an accurate state-of-the-art network of GPS control stations necessary
to meet the demands of government and private businesses for a reliable spatial ref-
erence  system  in  California.  This  infrastructure  will  aid  public  health  and  safety,
assist in the protection and preservation of natural resources, and improve the pro-
ductivity of government and private business.

DOC  also  requests  $2  million  to  implement  the  National  Vertical  Datum  Trans-
formation tool database, or VDatum. This tool supports NOAA’s requirement for hy-
drographic  and  shoreline  data  for  our  nautical  techniques.  VDatum  will  benefit
NOAA’s  modernization  efforts  in  shoreline  measurement  and  hydrographic  sur-
veying  for  navigation  safety.  In  addition,  the  tool  will  enable  sharing  of  geospatial
data  sets  among  federal/State/local  agencies  and  academia  by  translating  data  be-
tween disparate reference datums.

STATEMENT OF DR. CHARLES E. McQUEARY, UNDER

SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Dr.  MCQUEARY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member
Gordon,  and  distinguished  members  of  the  Committee.  It  is  a
pleasure to be here today to discuss the research and development
activities  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Science  and
Technology  Directorate.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  again,  for
your  foresight  in  recognizing  the  need  to  have  the  Science  and
Technology  Directorate  to  be  a  part  of  the  Homeland  Security  De-
partment.

The Nation’s advantage in science and technology is key to secur-
ing the homeland. The most important mission for the Science and
Technology  Directorate  is  to  develop  and  deploy  cutting-edge  tech-
nologies  and  new  capabilities  so  that  the  dedicated  men  and

women who serve to protect and secure our homeland can perform
their jobs more effectively and efficiently.

I would like to give you just a quick summary of some of the ac-
complishments that we have achieved since the last time I was be-
fore you. And I will list those in order.

We  have  developed  and  documented  a  robust  research  develop-
ment  testing  and  evaluation  process  that  includes  risk-based  plan-
ning,  and  you  will  see  some  of  the  effects  of  that  as  we  have  ad-
justed  the  recommended  funding  levels  across  our  portfolios.  We
have  continued  the  daily  operation  and  maintenance  and  deploy-
ment of BioWatch, which has been exceedingly successful for us so
far.  We  selected  four  cities  for  the  deployment  of  a  new  pilot  pro-
gram entitled the Regional Technology Integration initiative, which
was formerly called ‘‘Safe Cities.’’ We have selected over 100 under-
graduate and graduate students in the fall of 2004 for grants to as-
sist  the  study  of  science  and  technology  issues  that  support  the
homeland  security  mission.  We  launched  three  Homeland  Security
Centers  of  Excellence  to  date  with  contract  negotiations  taking
place  for  the  fourth.  We  issued  ten  major  R&D  solicitations  to  in-
dustry  through  the  first  20  months  of  our  existence  and  issued
more  than  200  contracts  to  do  research  work  on  behalf  of  the  De-
partment. We stood up the Department’s Office of Inter-operability
and  Compatibility,  and  we  collaborated—and  I  think  this  is  a  key
issue—we  collaborated  and  assisted  with  other  components  of  the
Department  to  enhance  their  abilities  to  meet  their  missions.  And
I  can  tell  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  believe  that  the  Department  ele-
ments recognize the importance of science in the missions that they
have to accomplish.

As I mentioned, the Science and Technology RDT&E—the Direc-
torate’s  RDT&E  process  uses  a  risk-based  approach  to  planning
and  is  oriented  towards  identifying  critical  capability  gaps  before
attempting to identify or develop technology solutions. The process
engages  the  end-user,  the  operational  units,  throughout  the  re-
quirements,  definition,  development,  testing,  and  transition,  and
the process considers the product life cycle from the outset, includ-
ing planning and budgeting for production, deployment, operations,
and  support.  It  is  this  process  which  allows  us  to  prioritize  both
within  and  across  fields  and  our  programs  are  derived  from  this
process.

The Science and Technology Directorate has organized its efforts
into research and development portfolios that span the set of prod-
uct  lines  of  the  Directorate.  Four  portfolios  address  the  develop-
ment  of  countermeasures  for  specific  terrorist  threats:  biological
countermeasures,  chemical  countermeasures,  explosive  counter-
measures, and radiological and nuclear countermeasures.

We have four portfolios that support the operational units of the
Department.  We  have  the  standards,  emerging  threats,  and  rapid
prototyping  portfolios  that  crosscut  all  of  the  terrorist  threats  and
enhance  the  research  and  development  conducted  in  the  counter-
measures portfolios.

The  Directorate  has  three  portfolios  that  focus  on  the  protection
of  the  Nation’s  vital  infrastructure  and  those  are  threat  and  vul-
nerability,  testing  and  assessment,  and  critical  infrastructure  pro-
tection  in  cyber  security,  an  area  I  know  that  is  very  important  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

68

you  and  to  other  Members  of  the  Committee.  The  Directorate  ad-
dresses  many  other  areas  as  well,  such  as  our  university  and  fel-
lowships program. We have a Counter–MANPADS program that is
seeking to improve technologies to protect commercial aircraft from
the threat of man-portable air defense systems. The Office of Inter-
operability and Compatibility, which is managed by the S&T group,
oversees the wide range of public safety inter-operability programs
and  efforts  currently  spread  across  homeland  security.  The  pro-
posed  new  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  is  being  established
to be a single entity responsible for coordinating and extending our
national efforts in nuclear and radiological detection.

At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  briefly  describe  some  of  our  2006
plans.  In  my  written  testimony,  I  have  included  a  listing  of  2004
accomplishments. In many of the things that we have done, it goes
into far more detail.

The  S&T  Directorate  has  requested  an  overall  fiscal  year  2006
budget  of  $1.368  billion,  which  is  an  increase  of  $253  million,  or
22.7 percent over the fiscal year 2005 budget. And this request in-
cludes  funding  for  requirements,  review  and  construction  planning
for the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility, the development of
a  low-volatility  agent  warning  system,  a  radiological  and  nuclear
countermeasures  testing  and  evaluation  complex,  additional  devel-
opment of the Counter–MANPADS system, and the consolidation of
the Department’s RDT&E units.

Let me just touch quickly upon the Homeland Security Institute,
because  I  think  there  may  be  questions  about  that  later.  The
Homeland Security Institute was stood up. It is an FFRDC unit in
support  of  the  entire  Department,  not  just  science  and  technology.
An  important  contribution  that  they  are  making  to  us  now  is  to
begin  to  examine  the  overall  system  architecture  for  how  we  will
put the various elements of the homeland security system together
to  work  as  a  system  rather  than  as  a  piece  parts,  where  we  have
in some cases now.

We  continue  to  be  active  participants  in  several  ongoing  inter-
agency  working  groups,  and  we  may  get  a  chance  to  talk  about
some  of  those,  but  I  think  what  I  will  do  is  wrap  this  up  now  so
we  can  get  to  the  questions  and  answers,  because  I  know  that  is
where we will have a chance to have an open dialogue.

So  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  thank  you  very

much for the opportunity to be here.

[The prepared statement of Dr. McQueary follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHARLES E. MCQUEARY

Introduction

Good  morning.  Chairman  Boehlert,  Congressman  Gordon,  and  distinguished
Members  of  the  Committee.  It  is  a  pleasure  to  be  with  you  today  to  discuss  the  re-
search  and  development  activities  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s
(DHS’s) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate.

The  Nation’s  advantage  in  science  and  technology  is  key  to  securing  the  home-
land.  The  most  important  mission  for  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  is  to
develop  and  deploy  cutting-edge  technologies  and  new  capabilities  so  that  the  dedi-
cated  men  and  women  who  serve  to  protect  and  secure  our  homeland  can  perform
their jobs more effectively and efficiently—these men and women are my customers.
When  I  last  reported  to  you  about  our  activities,  we  were  just  over  one  year  old
as a Department. Since my last report, the Science and Technology Directorate has:

69

1) Developed  and  documented  a  robust  Research,  Development,  Testing  and
Evaluation (RDT&E) process that includes risk-based planning for the S&T
Directorate’s programs and initiatives.

2) Continued daily operation, maintenance and deployment of BioWatch, a bi-
ological  agent  detection  system,  to  protect  the  Nation’s  major  population
centers from the threat and ramifications of a bioterrorist attack. BioWatch
also  provided  support  during  the  G8,  Democratic  National  Convention  and
Republican National Convention.

3) Selected  four  cities  for  the  deployment  of  a  new  pilot  program  entitled  the
Regional  Technology  Integration  (RTI)  initiative  (formerly  ‘‘Safe  Cities’’).
The  selected  cities  include:  Memphis,  TN;  Anaheim,  CA;  Cincinnati,  OH;
and  Seattle,  WA.  RTI  provides  an  integrated  urban  all-hazards  detection
and emergency response system.

4) Established  a  dedicated  National  Bioforensics  Center  to  support  ongoing
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement investiga-
tions.

5) Established  the  National  Visualization  and  Analytics  Center  and  the  Bio-
logical  Knowledge  Center  to  improve  the  analysis  of  information  and  close
knowledge gaps.

6) Established a test and evaluation capability for Radiological/Nuclear Coun-

termeasures at the Nevada Test Site.

7) Selected over 100 undergraduate and graduate students, in the fall of 2004,
for  grants  to  assist  in  the  study  of  science  and  technology  issues  that  sup-
port the homeland security mission.

8) Launched  three  Homeland  Security  Centers  of  Excellence  to  date  with  ne-
gotiations  taking  place  for  a  fourth  and  the  solicitation  released  for  the
fifth.

9) Issued  ten  major  R&D  solicitations  to  industry  and  academia  through  the
first  20  months  and  issued  more  than  200  contracts  for  research  work  to
date.

10) Collaborated  with  and  assisted  other  components  of  the  Department  to  en-
hance  their  abilities  to  meet  their  missions  and  become  active  contributors
in  interagency  working  groups—all  while  staffing  this  Directorate  with
some of this country’s brightest and most dedicated people.

11) Awarded four SAFETY Act designations and certifications, received and re-
sponded  to  72  full  applications  and  166  pre-applications,  and  worked  to
streamline the process.

12) Stood  up  the  Department’s  Office  of  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility  to
address  the  wide  range  of  public  safety  inter-operability  programs  and  ef-
forts currently spread across Homeland Security.

13) RapidCom  improved  incident-level,  inter-operable  emergency  communica-
tions in ten high-threat urban areas by helping to establish command-level
inter-operability within an hour or less.

14) Completed Phase I of the Counter–MANPADS Program and initiated Phase
II  which  will  advance  the  studies  initiated  in  phase  I,  build  system  proto-
types and conduct effectiveness testing.

I  continue  to  be  energized  by  and  proud  of  the  scientists,  engineers,  managers,
and support staff in the Science and Technology Directorate. We have accomplished
a great deal in a short amount of time and are positioning the Directorate to make
continuing contributions to the homeland security mission of the Department.

However,  the  threats  to  our  homeland  remain  diverse  and  daunting.  We  must
constantly  monitor  current  and  emerging  threats  and  assess  our  vulnerabilities  to
them,  develop  new  and  improved  capabilities  to  counter  them,  and  mitigate  the  ef-
fects of terrorist attacks should they occur. The Science and Technology Directorate
must also enhance the conventional missions of the Department to protect and pro-
vide assistance to civilians in response to natural disasters, law enforcement needs,
and other activities such as maritime search and rescue. Basically we assist in mak-
ing DHS operations science based, intelligence informed and technology enabled.
The Science and Technology Directorate’s Research, Development, Testing,

and Evaluation Process

As  I  just  mentioned,  one  of  the  Directorate’s  accomplishments  over  the  last  year
was  the  development  and  documentation  of  a  robust  Research,  Development,  Test-
ing, and Evaluation (RDT&E) process. The goal of the RDT&E process is to provide

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

a  clearly  defined,  repeatable  method  for  assessing  needs  and  risk,  planning,  allo-
cating  resources  and  executing  programs  to  produce  high-impact,  cost-effective  and
critically needed homeland security technology solutions.

The  S&T  Directorate’s  RDT&E  process  uses  a  risked-based  approach  to  planning
and is oriented toward identifying critical capability gaps before attempting to iden-
tify or develop technology solutions. In developing solutions, the process engages the
end-user  throughout  requirements  definition,  development,  testing  and  transition.
The process considers the product life cycle from the outset, including planning and
budgeting  for  production,  deployment,  operations  and  support.  It  is  this  process
which allows us to prioritize both within and across fields.

RDT&E consists of four main sub-processes: 1) needs and risk assessment, 2) stra-
tegic  planning,  3)  program  definition,  and  4)  program  execution.  The  first  two  sub-
processes ensure that the Science and Technology Directorate considers user needs,
available  intelligence,  big-picture  risks,  national  goals  and  inputs  from  other  exter-
nal  agencies  and  advisory  bodies  to  establish  its  annual  RDT&E  program.  The  sec-
ond  two  sub-processes  provide  a  framework  for  program  execution  using  the  best
available systems engineering and program management techniques.
Science and Technology Directorate Organization

We  have  four  key  offices  in  the  Science  &  Technology  Directorate,  each  of  which
has  an  important  role  in  implementing  the  Directorate’s  research,  development,
testing  and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  activities.  These  offices  are:  Plans,  Programs,  and
Budget  (PPB);  Office  of  Research  and  Development  (ORD);  Homeland  Security  Ad-
vanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (HSARPA);  and  Systems  Engineering  and  Devel-
opment  (SED).  In  addition,  the  S&T  Directorate  houses  the  Office  of  Weapons  of
Mass  Destruction  Operations  and  Incident  Management  to  offer  scientific  advice
and support to meet operational needs.

Crosscutting  the  four  key  offices,  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  imple-
ments  its  activities  through  focused  portfolios  that  address  biological,  chemical,  ex-
plosives,  radiological  and  nuclear,  and  cyber  threats;  support  the  research  and  de-
velopment  needs  of  the  operational  units  of  the  Department;  support  the  develop-
ment  of  standards  and  inter-operability;  develop  an  enduring  R&D  capability  for
homeland  security;  and  receive  valuable  input  from  private  industry  and  academia
as  well  as  national  and  federal  laboratories.  I  will  talk  about  the  offices  first  and
then about the portfolios.
Office of Plans, Programs, and Budget

PPB is organized into the portfolios I just mentioned, each of which is focused on
a  particular  discipline  or  activity;  taken  together,  these  portfolios  span  the  Direc-
torate’s mission space. As I will cover the portfolios in detail later in this testimony,
I  will  limit  myself  here  to  a  summary  explanation.  The  staff  of  each  portfolio  is
charged with being expert in their particular area; with understanding the activities
and capabilities extant in federal agencies and across the broad research and devel-
opment  community;  and  with  developing  a  strategic  plan  for  their  particular  port-
folio, to include near-, mid-, and long-range research and development activities. In
addition,  we  have  staff  that  is  charged  with  understanding  the  threat  from  a  tech-
nical  perspective,  with  integrating  the  various  portfolios  into  a  coherent  overall
plan,  and  with  developing  the  corresponding  budget  and  monitoring  its  financial
execution.

Finally, PPB is responsible for executing the Directorate’s implementation respon-
sibilities  for  the  SAFETY  (Support  Anti-Terrorism  by  Fostering  Effective  Tech-
nologies) Act.
Office of Research and Development

ORD  provides  the  Nation  with  an  enduring  capability  in  research,  development,
demonstration, testing and evaluation of technologies to protect the homeland. ORD
builds  enduring  RDT&E  capability  through  stewardship  of  the  homeland  security
comple—people,  places,  and  programs—to  anticipate,  prevent,  respond  to  and  re-
cover from terrorist attacks.

Activities within ORD address the resources that can be brought to bear to better
secure the homeland through the participation of universities, national laboratories,
federal laboratories and research centers.
Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency

HSARPA  is  an  external  research-funding  arm  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Di-
rectorate. It has at its disposal a full range of contracting vehicles and the authority
under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to engage businesses, federally funded re-
search  and  development  centers,  universities,  and  other  government  partners  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

71

performing its mission to gather, generate and develop ideas, concepts and advanced
technologies to protect the homeland.

HSARPA’s  mission  is  to  support  basic,  applied,  and  advanced  homeland  security
research  to  promote  revolutionary  changes  in  technologies  that  would  promote
homeland  security;  advance  the  development,  testing  and  evaluation,  and  deploy-
ment of homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deploy-
ment  of  technologies  that  would  address  homeland  security  vulnerabilities.  Its  cus-
tomers are State and local first responders and federal agencies that are allied with
homeland security such as the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Citizen-
ship  and  Immigration  Services,  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  and  oth-
ers.

About 60 percent of the Science and Technology Directorate’s appropriation in FY
2005  will  be  executed  directly  through  the  private  sector,  with  HSARPA  managing
about 40 percent of that.
Office of Systems Engineering and Development

SED  is  tasked  with  leading  the  implementation  and  transition  of  large-scale  or
pilot  systems  to  the  field  through  a  rapid,  efficient  and  disciplined  approach  to
project management.

One  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate’s  challenges  is  to  evaluate  a  wide
spectrum  of  military  and  commercial  technologies  so  rapid,  effective  and  affordable
solutions  can  be  transitioned  to  the  Department’s  customers  that  include  first  re-
sponders  and  federal  agencies.  In  some  cases,  military  technologies  could  be  can-
didates  for  commercialization,  but  rigorous  systems  engineering  processes  need  to
be  applied  to  ensure  a  successful  transition.  SED’s  role  is  to  identify  and  then,  in
a  disciplined  manner,  reduce  risks  associated  with  such  technologies  to  ready  them
for  deployment  to  the  field.  In  doing  so,  the  office  must  view  each  technology
through  the  prism  of  affordability,  performance  and  supportability—all  critical  to
end-users.

SED  must  weigh  considerations  such  as  the  urgency  for  a  solution,  consequences
of the threat, safety of the product, and life cycle support as new products are intro-
duced. Products must be user friendly, have a minimum of false alarms, require lit-
tle  or  no  training  and  consistently  provide  accurate  results.  SED  will  demonstrate
and test solutions before they are released to the field, and will validate that those
solutions meet user expectations. SED also operates our Countermeasures Test Bed
capability, which provides end-user ‘‘in the loop’’ operational testing and evaluations
to the Directorate’s portfolios.
Office  of  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  Operations  and  Incident  Manage-

ment

We  created  the  Office  of  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  Operations  and  Incident
Management  as  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate’s  operational  arm  for  DHS
support  to  incident  management.  Through  this  Office,  the  Science  and  Technology
Directorate  exercises  its  scientific  and  technical  leadership  role  under  the  National
Response  Plan.  This  Office  provides  rapid  scientific  and  technical  expertise  and  ex-
ecutive decision support to the Secretary, DHS response units, interagency partners,
and  the  State  and  local  jurisdictions  that  form  the  front  line  response  to  chemical,
biological, radiological, nuclear and high-explosives threats and incidents.
Results From Current Research and Development (R&D) Spending and FY

2006 Plans: Portfolio Details

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  has  organized  its  efforts  into  research
and  development  portfolios  that  span  the  set  of  product  lines  of  the  Directorate.
Four  portfolios  address  the  development  of  countermeasures  for  specific  terrorist
threats:  Biological  Countermeasures,  Chemical  Countermeasures,  Explosives  Coun-
termeasures, and Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures.

In  addition  to  the  countermeasures  portfolios,  four  portfolios  support  the  oper-
ational  units  of  the  Department:  Border  and  Transportation  Security  (BTS),  Emer-
gency  Preparedness  and  Response  (EPR),  United  States  Coast  Guard  (USCG)  and
United States Secret Service (USSS) portfolios.

The  Standards,  Emerging  Threats,  and  Rapid  Prototyping  portfolios  crosscut  all
terrorist threats and enhance the research and development conducted in the coun-
termeasures portfolio.

The  Directorate  has  three  portfolios  that  focus  on  the  protection  of  the  Nation’s
vital  infrastructure:  Threat  and  Vulnerability,  Testing  and  Assessment,  Critical  In-
frastructure Protection and Cyber Security.

The S&T Directorate addresses other areas as well:

• Our University and Fellowship Programs portfolio addresses the need to build
an  enduring  science  and  technology  capability  and  support  United  States
leadership in science and technology.

• Our  Counter–MANPADS  program  is  seeking  to  improve  technologies  to  pro-
tect  commercial  aircraft  from  the  threat  of  MAN-Portable  Air  Defense  Sys-
tems (MANPADS).

• The  Office  of  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility  (OIC),  managed  by  the
Science  and  Technology  Directorate,  oversees  the  wide  range  of  public  safety
inter-operability  programs  and  efforts  currently  spread  across  Homeland  Se-
curity,  including  critical  inter-operability  issues  relating  to  public  safety  and
emergency  response,  including  communications,  equipment,  training,  and
other areas as needs are identified.

• The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is being established to be the
single  entity  responsible  for  coordinating  and  extending  efforts  in  nuclear/ra-
diological  detection.  This  office  will  consolidate  functions  within  the  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  and  establish  strong  linkages  across  the  inter-
agency  for  the  deployment  of  a  national  domestic  nuclear  detection  architec-
ture,  the  conduct  of  transformational  research  and  development,  and  the  es-
tablishment  of  protocols  and  training  for  the  end  users  of  equipment  devel-
oped and deployed through the new office.

At this time I would like to briefly describe some of our accomplishments to date
and  our  FY  2006  plans.  As  can  be  seen  in  the  following  chart,  we  have  an  overall
FY  2006  budget  request  of  $1.368  billion,  which  is  an  increase  of  $253.0  million
(22.7 percent) over the FY 2005 levels. The request includes the construction of the
National  Bio  and  Agrodefense  Facility,  the  development  of  a  Low-Volatility  Agent
Warning  System,  a  Radiological/Nuclear  Countermeasures  Testing  and  Evaluation
Complex, additional development of Counter-Man-Portable-Air-Defense Systems (C–
MANPADS), and the consolidation of the Department’s RDT&E activities.

Biological Countermeasures

Biological  threats  can  take  many  forms  and  be  distributed  in  many  ways.  Aero-
solized anthrax, smallpox, foot and mouth disease, and bulk food contamination are
among  the  threats  that  can  have  high  consequences  for  humans  and  agriculture.
Our Biological Countermeasures portfolio uses the Nation’s science base to prevent,
protect, respond to, and recover from bioterrorism events. This portfolio provides the
science and technology needed to reduce the probability and potential consequences
of  a  biological  attack  on  this  nation’s  civilian  population,  its  infrastructure,  and  its
agricultural  system.  Portfolio  managers  and  scientists  are  developing  and  imple-
menting  an  integrated  systems  approach  with  a  wide  range  of  activities,  including

vulnerability  and  risk  analyses  to  identify  the  need  for  vaccines,  therapeutics,  and
diagnostics;  development  and  implementation  of  early  detection  and  warning  sys-
tems  to  characterize  an  attack  and  permit  early  prophylaxis  and  decontamination
activities;  and  development  of  a  national  bioforensics  analysis  capability  to  support
attribution of biological agent use.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Biological Countermeasures portfolio:

• Deployed  the  BioWatch  environmental  sensor  system  to  protect  our  nation’s
cities from the threat and ramifications of a bioterrorist attack. BioWatch ac-
tivities  were  significantly  increased  during  the  National  Code  Orange  Alert
(December 2003–January 2004), with twice daily samplings in the high threat
cities,  additional  collectors  for  special  New  Year’s  events  and  Bowl  Games,
and  deployment  of  temporary  BioWatch  systems  to  non-BioWatch  cities  of
special  concern.  BioWatch  also  provided  field  and  laboratory  support  to  the
G8,  the  Democratic  National  Convention  and  the  Republican  National  Con-
vention in Boston and New York.
• Engaged in creating more near real-time monitoring of critical infrastructure
facilities such as major transportation hubs. New infrastructure protection ef-
forts  include  shorter  response  time  biological  agent  detection  capabilities  for
BioWatch. This pilot is in the process of being deployed in New York City and
will join a three-to-five expansion of the number of collectors in that city.
• Initiated  the  design  of  the  National  Biosurveillance  Integration  System
(NBIS)  as  part  of  an  interagency  process.  Recently  completed  in  the  first
quarter  of  FY  2005,  we  will  work  with  the  Information  Analysis  and  Infra-
structure Protection (IAIP) Directorate to implement this system.
• Conducted  preliminary  analyses,  using  the  reference  scenario  approach  rec-
ommended  by  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  (HSPD)–10  for  un-
derstanding  the  requirements  of  an  integrated  national  biodefense  architec-
ture,  of  four  baseline  reference  cases:  a  large  outdoor  release  of  a  non-con-
tagious  agent  (anthrax);  a  large  indoor  release  of  a  contagious  agent  (small-
pox);  contamination  of  a  bulk  food  supply;  and  two  highly  virulent  agricul-
tural  attacks,  one  on  livestock  (Foot  and  Mouth  Disease)  and  the  other  on
plants (soy bean rust).
• Established  the  Biodefense  Knowledge  Center,  an  operational  hub  for  ena-
bling collaboration and communication within the homeland security complex.
The Biodefense Knowledge Center will meet the operational and planning re-
quirements  of  government  decision-makers  and  program  planners,  the  intel-
ligence  community,  law  enforcement  officers,  public  health  practitioners,  and
scientists.  Specific  capabilities  offered  to  these  end-users  include  knowledge
services,  modeling  and  simulation,  situational  awareness  and  a  pathway  to
accelerate research and development.

In FY 2006, the Biological Countermeasure portfolio plans to:

• Complete  the  three  high  level  architectures  initiated  in  FY  2005  (multiple
small  attacks,  an  engineered  organism,  and  an  intentional  spread  of  a
zoonotic disease), identifying key requirements for each major element, a ‘‘re-
port  card’’  on  the  current  and  projected  status  in  that  area  and  performing
detailed design tradeoffs for those areas in which DHS has execution respon-
sibility.
• Complete the first formal risk assessment required under HSPD–10 and close
many  of  the  key  remaining  experimental  gaps  in  our  knowledge  of  the  clas-
sical  biological  threat  agents.  Near-,  mid-,  and  long-term  plans  for  dealing
with  engineered  agents  will  be  developed,  and  R&D  on  addressing  the  gaps
in responding to modified organisms (e.g., antibiotic resistant) initiated.
• Complete the deployment of Generation 2 BioWatch systems to the top threat
cities  while  continuing  to  operate  and  optimize  already  extant  BioWatch  sys-
tems. Complete test and evaluation of laboratory prototypes of the Generation
3  BioWatch  detection  systems  which  will  be  ready  for  down-selection  those
which will go on to develop fieldable prototypes in FY 2007.
• Continue operation of the interim National Bioforensic Analysis Center. Inter-
national  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  certification  is  expected  to
have  been  achieved,  giving  the  analyses  conducted  additional  credibility  and
authenticity  in  both  the  national  and  international  community  and  courts  of
law.  R&D  will  continue  on  the  physical  and  chemical  signatures  of  the  ‘‘ma-
trix’’ materials associated with biological agents so as to develop methods for
understanding  tell-tale  remnants  of  enrichment  media,  culture  conditions,
metabolites, and dispersion technology.

• Continue  operation  of  the  Plum  Island  Animal  Disease  Center  (PIADC)  and
essential  upgrades  to  the  facility  and  initiate  design  of  the  National  Bio  and
Agrodefense  Facility  (NBAF).  R&D  will  continue  on  next  generation  vaccines
and  antiviral  therapeutics  for  foot  and  mouth  disease  (FMD)  and  other  high
priority foreign animal diseases.
• Continue  to  develop  bioassays  for  FMD  and  look-alike  animal  diseases.  The
initial  agricultural  forensic  capability  established  in  FY  2004  at  PIADC  will
be  enhanced  and  epidemiologic  capability  added.  A  High  Throughput
Diagnostics  Demonstration  will  be  initiated  to  work  with  regional  and  State
laboratories  to  demonstrate  a  capability  of  analyzing  thousands  of  samples
per  day  in  support  of  response  to  a  suspected  case  or  an  outbreak.  A  FMD
table  top  exercise  of  DHS  Directorates  will  be  initiated,  and  development  of
a  coupled  epidemiological  and  economic  model  for  FMD  will  begin.  The  end-
to-end  systems  study  initiated  in  FY  2004  for  Soybean  Rust  and  FMD  will
be  completed,  and  system  studies  initiated  for  highly  pathogenic  avian  influ-
enza.

National Bio-Defense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC)

The  NBACC,  a  key  component  of  the  National  Strategy  for  Homeland  Security,
addresses the need for scientific research to better anticipate, prevent, and mitigate
the  consequences  of  biological  attacks.  The  need  for  the  NBACC  facility  is  further
defined  in  the  Presidential  Directive  Biodefense  for  the  21st  Century,  the  Nation’s
blueprint  for  future  biodefense  programs.  The  NBACC’s  mission  will  support  two
pillars  of  this  blueprint—threat  awareness  and  surveillance  and  detection.  The
NBACC  is  made  up  of  two  centers,  the  Biological  Threat  Characterization  Center
and  the  National  Bioforensic  Analysis  Center  to  carry  out  these  missions.  Specifi-
cally, NBACC’s mission is to:

• Understand  current  and  future  biological  threats,  assess  vulnerabilities,  and
determine potential impacts to guide the research, development, and acquisi-
tion of biodefense countermeasures such as detectors, drugs, vaccines and de-
contamination technologies; and
• Provide a national capability for conducting forensic analysis of evidence from
bio-crimes  and  terrorism  to  attain  a  ‘‘biological  fingerprint’’  to  identify  per-
petrators and determine the origin and method of attack.

In FY 2004, the Department completed the planning and conceptual design of the
NBACC  facility.  Additionally,  the  Department  has  been  working  through  the  Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process during the year, which culminated
in the signing of the Record of Decision in January 2005 of the Final Environmental
Impact  Statement  (EIS)  for  the  construction  project  and  subsequent  operations.  It
was  decided  to  delay  the  award  of  any  contracts  for  design  and  construction  until
further  in  the  EIS  process.  As  the  public  concerns  are  analyzed  and  considered  it
is anticipated that contracts will be awarded in FY 2005 to initiate design and con-
struction of the NBACC facility.

In  FY  2005,  the  solicitations  of  contracts  for  the  design  and  construction  of  the
NBACC  facility  are  expected  to  be  awarded.  The  design  of  the  NBACC  facility  will
commence in March 2005. $35M was appropriated to obligate funds for award of the
construction  contract  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  FY  2005.  Construction  of  the  facility
is planned for completion by the fourth quarter of FY 2008.

In FY 2006, funding was not requested for the construction of the NBACC facility.

Chemical Countermeasures

The  National  Research  Council  Report,  Making  the  Nation  Safer,  points  out  that
‘‘chemicals continue to be the weapon of choice for terrorist attacks.’’ Until recently,
the chemical threat spectrum was limited to the threats posed by chemical warfare
agents (CWAs) in a military context and the threats posed by the accidental or inad-
vertent release of toxic materials in the homeland domain. Now, the chemical threat
spectrum has expanded to include chemical warfare agents (CWAs), toxic industrial
chemicals (TICs), non-traditional agents (NTAs) and toxins. As with the threat ma-
terials themselves, the range of potentially attractive targets is large. The potential
for  chemical  warfare  agents  and  emerging  threat  agents  constitute  a  broad  range
of threats that may be applied to virtually any civilian target.

The Chemical Countermeasures portfolio works to enhance the Nation’s capability
to  anticipate,  prevent,  protect,  respond  to  and  recover  from  chemical  threat  attacks
through  interagency  leadership  and  conduct  of  innovative  research,  development,
and technology transition. The portfolio works through the interagency environment
to shape a comprehensive strategy for enhancing the Nation’s defensive posture and
to develop bases for enhanced R&D program integration and leverage. The R&D ac-

tivities  include  prioritization  of  efforts  among  the  many  possible  chemical  threats
and  targets,  and  development  of  new  detection  and  forensic  technologies  and  inte-
grated  protective  systems  for  high-value  facilities  such  as  airports  and  subways.
These activities are informed by end-user input and simulated exercises.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Chemical Countermeasures portfolio:

• Conducted preliminary activities toward the development of a Chemical Secu-
rity  Analysis  Center  (CSAC)  that  will  provide  threat  awareness  and  assess-
ment. An overall structure, similar to that characterizing the NBACC and its
supporting  threat  characterization,  forensics,  knowledge  management  and
reachback, is envisioned.

• Initiated  system  studies  around  three  defining  scenarios:  indoor  chemical
agent  release,  outdoor  toxic  industrial  chemical  release,  and  release  of  toxin
in the water system.

• Initiated  three  demonstration  projects:  the  Facility  Restoration  Demonstra-
tion Project to develop and demonstrate a capability to rapidly restore a facil-
ity  that  has  been  contaminated  with  a  classical  chemical  agent  or  persistent
toxic  industrial  chemical  (TIC);  a  Water  Security  Demonstration  to  identify
and  characterize  technologies  with  the  potential  to  provide  warning  of  chem-
ical  contamination  of  the  water  system;  and  a  National  Security  Special
Event (NSSE) Deployable Detection System Demonstration to develop a flexi-
ble  architecture  chemical  detection  system  that  can  be  utilized  for  the  warn-
ing and situational awareness of chemical threats in temporary deployments.
• Initiated  key  development  programs  targeting  leap-ahead  advancements  in
detection capabilities. These programs will develop two principal capabilities:
a  facility  monitoring  detector  and  a  responder  detection  tool.  In  both  cases,
the  detectors  will  provide  detection  and  discrimination  of  up  to  20  different
chemical  threats,  including  classical  chemical  warfare  agents  (CWAs)  and
toxic  industrial  chemicals  (TICs)  in  a  single  unit  across  a  wide  range  of  con-
centrations.

In FY 2006, the Chemical Countermeasure portfolio plans to:

will be centrally located and accessible.

• Reach  full  operational  status  at  the  CSAC  where  chemical  threat  databases
• Complete  technology  down-select  and  draft  candidate  decontamination  proto-
cols  in  concert  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  through  the
Facility  Restoration  Technology  Demonstration.  Transition  the  Water  Secu-
rity  Demonstration  to  EPA  for  continuation  and  conduct  technology  down-se-
lect  for  the  next-generation  deployable  capability  through  the  NSSE  Tech-
nology Demonstration.
• Complete the critical design review of technologies for the rapid facility mon-
itor  and  the  first  responder  tool  and  conduct  a  technology  down-select  sup-
porting prototype selection and build.
• Initiate and demonstrate operational solutions to the challenge of decontami-
nating  non-traditional  agents  and  initiate  next-generation  decontamination
research.

Explosives Countermeasures

The Explosives Countermeasures portfolio addresses the threat that terrorists will
use explosives in attacks on buildings, critical infrastructure, and the civilian popu-
lation  of  the  United  States.  The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate’s  Explosives
portfolio  has  been  closely  coordinated  with  the  activities  ongoing  in  the  Transpor-
tation  Security  Administration  to  ensure  that  research  and  development  (R&D)  ac-
tivities are complementary, not duplicative; in FY 2006, these activities will be con-
solidated  within  the  S&T  Directorate.  R&D  priorities  in  the  Explosives  Counter-
measures portfolio focus on the detection of vehicle bombs and suicide bombers and
on  providing  the  science  and  technology  needed  to  significantly  increase  our  ability
to prevent an explosives attack on buildings, infrastructure or people.
In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Explosives Countermeasures portfolio:

• Addressed terrorist attacks against buildings and the general population. The
portfolio  initiated  the  development  of  a  prototype  explosive  detector  for  vehi-
cle  bombs,  and  accelerated  the  development  of  hardened  overhead  storage
bins  for  passenger  aircraft.  Additionally,  it  initiated  a  survey  and  evaluation
of  commercial-off-the-shelf  equipment  to  detect,  interdict  and  mitigate  the
consequences of suicide bombers and vehicle bombs, and conducted a cost-ben-
efit analysis of approaches to aircraft hardening.

76

• Funded  the  demonstration  in  FY  2005  of  the  capabilities  identified  in  FY
2004,  used  to  provide  the  ability  to  detect,  interdict,  and  mitigate  the  con-
sequences from suicide bombers, truck, and car bombs approaching high pro-
file targets and densely populated areas.

In FY 2006, the Explosives Countermeasure portfolio plans to:

• Continue  to  consolidate  explosives  management  functions  as  outlined  above.
Efforts  will  focus  on  developing  the  ability  to  detect,  interdict  and  mitigate
the  consequences  from  suicide  bombers,  truck  and  car  bombs  approaching
high  profile  targets  and  densely  populated  areas.  Additonally,  the  portfolio
will  provide  the  ability  to  detect,  interdict  and  mitigate  the  consequences  of
explosives  and  weapons  on  aircraft  transporting  (domestic  and  foreign  in-
bound)  passengers  and  their  baggage  as  well  as  cargo  containers/bays.  Spe-
cific  areas  to  be  pursued  are  infrastructure  protection,  suicide  bombers/leave
behind improvised explosive devices, and vehicle bombs.

Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures

Potential  radiological  and  nuclear  threats  range  from  the  deliberate  dispersal  of
small  amounts  of  radioactive  material  to  the  detonation  of  an  improvised  or  stolen
nuclear  weapon  to  an  attack  on  our  nuclear  power  industry.  Our  Radiological  and
Nuclear  Countermeasures  portfolio  provides  the  science  and  technology  needed  to
reduce  both  the  probability  and  the  potential  consequences  of  a  radiological  or  nu-
clear attack on this nation’s civilian population or our nuclear power facilities. Many
of  the  on-going  activities  conducted  in  the  Radiological/Nuclear  Countermeasures
Portfolio are being transferred in FY 2006 to the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office
(DNDO). Those activities are indicated in the next section.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasures portfolio:

• Formally  assumed  management  of  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New
Jersey radiation detection test bed from the Department of Energy in August,
2003. Following the transfer, the portfolio broadened the project scope beyond
testing and evaluating individual pieces of technology to a systems approach,
including response protocols and operational concepts. This program has been
renamed  the  Countermeasures  Test  Bed  to  more  accurately  reflect  that  this
program  supports  DHS’s  enduring  operational  testing  and  evaluation  needs
for  all  threat  countermeasures  technology,  not  just  Radiological/Nuclear
threats.

• Focused  detection  technology  efforts  on  the  detection  of  shielded  special  nu-
clear material (SNM) in cargo containers, based on the detection of both neu-
trons  and  delayed  high-energy  fission  product  gamma  rays,  and  a  portable
neutron  source,  based  on  a  mixed  alpha-Be  source  in  a  switchable  configura-
tion  for  use  in  active  interrogation;  both  currently  are  still  in  conceptual  de-
sign and experiment phases.

• Preplanned  product  improvement  efforts  in  this  area  were  directed  towards
improvements  in  two  current  Customs  and  Border  Protection-deployed  radio-
graphic  imaging  systems.  This  included  software  improvements  and  systems
upgrades  for  local  data  integration,  threat  image  projection  (TIP),  and  as-
sisted imaging processing (AIP).

• Incident  management/recovery  efforts  include  a  joint  DHS/HSARPA  and
DOD/DARPA  (Department  of  Defense/Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency)  project  focusing  on  radiological  and  nuclear  decontamination,  con-
sisting of four main tasks: (1) Radionuclide capture decontamination; (2) Wide
area radionuclide decontamination; (3) Verification; and (4) Modeling.

• A  major  goal  of  FY  2005  is  to  establish  a  test  and  evaluation  capability  at
the  Nevada  Test  Site  (NTS)  for  testing  against  SNM,  and,  as  appropriate,  to
test  and  evaluate  relevant  FY  2005  prototype  technologies  developed  in  the
portfolio’s programs.

In FY 2006, the Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasure portfolio plans to:

• Redirect  all  detection  related  missions  and  corresponding  funding  to  the  es-
tablishment of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The remaining, non-de-
tection research and development will continue to be funded through the Ra-
diological/Nuclear  Countermeasures  portfolio.  The  two  programmatic  thrust
areas remaining are Incident Management and Recovery, and Attribution and
Forensics  on  Contaminated  Evidence  (formerly  part  of  the  Systems  Analysis
and Pilot Deployments programmatic area).

• Complete the laboratory improvements that are necessary to carry out the at-

tribution mission.

• Complete  all  field  studies  for  the  New  York  City  Urban  Dispersion  Program
with  a  technology  transfer  following  to  NYC  Office  of  Emergency  Manage-
ment in late 2006.

Domestic Nuclear Detection Office

The  risk  that  terrorists  will  acquire  and  use  a  Nuclear/Radiological  device  is  one
of  the  gravest  threats  that  confronts  the  Nation.  Acquiring  nuclear  weapons  and
materials  is  the  hardest  step  for  terrorists  to  take,  and  the  easiest  for  us  to  stop.
By  contrast,  every  subsequent  step  in  the  process  becomes  easier  for  the  terrorists,
and harder for us to stop. Our defensive posture must begin with eliminating excess
stocks  of  nuclear  material  and  weapons  throughout  the  world,  protecting  existing
stocks from theft or diversion, and detecting illicit movement of nuclear/radiological
material overseas before it reaches our borders. However, recognizing that even the
best efforts to secure weapons and fissile material may not achieve 100 percent suc-
cess,  we  must  supplement  these  efforts  abroad  with  a  stronger  layer  of  protection
at home.

We must move swiftly to deploy a well-integrated system of detectors for nuclear/
radiological materials and improve this system over time. While such a system will
never  be  foolproof,  it  can  dramatically  improve  the  probability  that  we  could  detect
illicit  nuclear  or  radiological  materials  being  brought  covertly  into  position  for  use
by  an  adversary.  The  gravity  of  the  risk  demands  the  focused,  aggressive  program
envisioned here, with its mutually supportive elements of deploying and knitting to-
gether current technology so as to exact the greatest possible protection for our pop-
ulation while working continuously to improve that technology over time.

Since  9/11,  many  agencies  have  expanded  their  activities  and  operations  to  help
build the domestic layers of the Nation’s defense against nuclear terrorism. To opti-
mize  and  advance  these  efforts,  a  new  national-level,  jointly  staffed  Domestic  Nu-
clear  Detection  Office  (DNDO)  is  being  created  to  coordinate  and  extend  the  efforts
in  nuclear/radiological  detection.  This  office  will  consolidate  functions  within  DHS
and  establish  strong  linkages  across  the  interagency  for  the  deployment  of  a  na-
tional  domestic  nuclear  detection  architecture,  the  conduct  of  transformational  re-
search and development (R&D), and the establishment of protocols and training for
the end users of equipment developed and deployed through the new office. The of-
fice will further serve as the primary entity to

• Further develop, acquire, and support the deployment of an enhanced domes-
tic  system  to  detect  and  report  on  any  attempt  to  import,  possess,  store,
transport,  develop,  or  use  an  unauthorized  nuclear  explosive  device,  fissile
material, or radiological material in the United States;

• Enhance  and  coordinate  the  nuclear  detection  efforts  of  Federal,  State,  and

Building  upon  the  redirected  base  funding  of  $113  million  for  detection  related
RDT&E in the Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasures Portfolio, the FY 2006 request
includes an additional $105.0 million to support the DNDO’s mission and objectives
(plus  the  $9  million  requested  increase  for  the  Radiological/Nuclear  Counter-
measures Test and Evaluation Complex (Rad/NUc CTEC) discussed later in the FY
2006 Science and Technology Directorate Initiatives section.

Although the DNDO is principally focused on domestic detection, its coordinating
work  will  enhance  U.S.  efforts  overseas  through  the  design  of  a  global  architecture
implemented under current agency responsibilities. The new investments will speed
the  development  and  improvement  of  equipment  and  protocols,  much  of  which  will
be applicable overseas.

Because multiple agencies share the resources or expertise necessary for the suc-
cess  of  the  office,  the  DNDO  will  be  located  within  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security  (DHS),  but  will  be  jointly  staffed  with  representatives  from  DHS,  the  De-
partment of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Federal Bu-
reau  of  Investigation  (FBI),  with  coordination  between  the  Department  of  Justice
(DOJ),  the  Department  of  State  (DOS),  the  Intelligence  Community  (IC),  and  other
departments as needed.

The  DNDO  mission  will  be  carried  out  through  an  organization  that  includes  a
Director  supported  by  five  major  offices:  Systems  Engineering  and  Planning,  Sys-
tems  Development  and  Acquisition,  Assessments,  Joint  Center 
for  Global
Connectivity,  and  Transformational  Research  &  Development.  These  offices  would
be staffed jointly by appropriate agencies.

In FY 2006, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office plans to:

• Develop  the  system  architecture,  conduct  all  associated  systems  engineering,

develop technology roadmaps, and develop a strategic plan for the DNDO.

• Define the domestic nuclear detection architecture.
• Conduct research and development in support of the DNDO mission.
• Coordinate with other federal, State, and local R&D organizations.
• Develop concepts for innovative technologies and coordinate with interagency
R&D  organizations  on  all  advanced  detection  technologies,  development  con-
cepts, and programs.

• Develop  and  provide  technical  standards  and  protocols  for  detection  systems,

reporting systems, and information sharing systems.

• Design  and  conduct  technical  and  operational  test  and  evaluation  of  related
detection equipment, technologies, systems, procedures, concepts of operation,
and protocols for the domestic nuclear detection system.

• Prepare and maintain the DNDO Test and Evaluation Master Plan.
• Oversee  the  Radiological  and  Nuclear  Countermeasures  Test  and  Evaluation
Complex  (Rad/NucCTEC)  and  use  other  Rad/Nuc  test  infrastructure  as  need-
ed to execute the Office’s assessment responsibilities.
• Provide  operational  support,  to  include:  (1)  information  collection,  coordina-
tion, and analysis; (2) coordinated technical reachback; and (3) and the devel-
opment of standards, protocols, concepts of operations, training, safety and se-
curity procedures, and State and local support.
• Identify  technology  opportunities  and  execute  programs  to  dramatically  im-
prove the domestic nuclear detection system overall and component-wise per-
formance, especially high-risk, high-payoff technology investments.

Threat and Vulnerability, Testing and Assessment

Our  Threat  and  Vulnerability,  Testing  and  Assessment  (TVTA)  portfolio  is  de-
signed  to  develop,  test,  and  deliver—in  collaboration  with  intelligence,  law  enforce-
ment,  and  homeland  security  community  agencies—tools  and  methodologies  for  as-
sessing  terrorist  threats  and  understanding  terrorism.  The  TVTA  portfolio  focuses
on the following five areas:

• Threat  Assessment:  Create  and  establish  coherent  capabilities  for  analysis,
dissemination,  visualization,  insight,  synthesis,  and  enhancement  of  ter-
rorism-related information.
• Data Sharing: Enable tactical and strategic sharing of terrorism-related intel-
ligence,  information,  and  data  among  all  elements  of  the  homeland  security
community.

79

• Forecasting:  Identify,  understand,  and  forecast  terrorist  motives,  intentions,
behaviors, capabilities, processes, and tactics; understand individual and soci-
etal resilience to terrorism.
• Scalable  Analyses:  Enable  scalable,  integrated  simulation  and  information
analyses  for  threat  identification  and  assessment;  develop  innovative  com-
putational technologies for deployment in next-generation knowledge manage-
ment and threat assessment tools.
• System  Optimization:  Create  optimized  knowledge  system  designs  and  archi-

tectures that enhance the Nation’s countermeasures.

This portfolio provides the science and technology needed to develop methods and
tools  to  test  and  assess  threats  and  vulnerabilities  to  protect  critical  infrastructure
and  enhance  information  exchange;  this  portfolio  also  includes  a  Biometrics  Pro-
gram.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the TVTA Countermeasures portfolio:

• Delivered  two  operational  components,  the  Threat  Vulnerability  Integration
System  (TVIS)  and  the  Threat-Vulnerability  Mapper  (TVM),  to  the  Informa-
tion Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Directorate. The TVM pro-
vides  counterterrorism  analysts  with  a  simple,  straightforward  way  to  depict
the geographic distribution of threats across the U.S. and to search the under-
lying  databases  for  information  on  terrorists  and  attacks.  TVIS  integrates
high-volume  information  analysis  capabilities  with  specialized  visualization
tools  that  enable  analysts  to  process  large  amounts  of  disparate  intelligence
data.
• Created  the  knowledge  management  architecture,  known  as  ADVISE  (Anal-
ysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, and Semantic Enhancement) to in-
tegrate  the  various  information  analysis  and  synthesis,  visualization,  and
knowledge  discovery  component  capabilities.  ADVISE  will  incorporate  a  com-
prehensive  encyclopedia  of  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  nuclear  and  ex-
plosive  (CBRNE)  threat  and  effects  data.  Pilot  ADVISE  systems  for  the  BTS
Directorate  will  be  installed  in  FY  2005.  Update  the  initial  TVIS  system  at
the Biodefense Knowledge Center with the enhanced ADVISE capability.
• Created  the  Interagency  Center  for  Applied  Homeland  Security  Technology
(ICAHST)  capable  of  addressing  the  technical  needs  of  the  Department  and
other  members  of  the  Homeland  Security  community.  The  center  and  its
interconnected laboratories provides detailed technical information and guides
research, strategy, and systems design for the broad range of technologies and
techniques necessary to identify, understand, and remediate CBRNE threats.
• Completed an initial set of 120 all-CBRNE capability assessments for 20 ter-
rorist  organizations  on  the  five  CBRNE  plus  cyber  threat  agents.  Continued
support to the Nuclear Assessment Program (NAP) that judges the credibility
of  communicated  nuclear  threats  for  such  clients  as  the  FBI,  DOE,  and  De-
partment  of  State  (DOS).  In  FY  2005,  continue  to  produce  all-CBRNE  capa-
bility  assessments.  An  additional  20  terrorist  groups’  capabilities  and  inten-
tions will be analyzed using information from the intelligence community.
• Continued to implement the capability to analyze terrorist threats and stimu-
late  analytical  insight  using  visualization  tools  and  techniques  in  FY  2005.
The  National  Visualization  and  Analytics  Center  (NVAC),  established  in  FY
2004,  will  produce  a  national  agenda  for  visual  analytics  with  broad  input
and support from the government, national laboratories and universities. The
four NVAC core functions include research and development, education, tech-
nology  evaluation  and  implementation,  integration  and  coordination.  Three
Regional Visual Analytics Centers (RVACs) will also be established, to imple-
ment  the  visualization  agenda  on  a  regional  scale.  The  RVACs  will  incor-
porate university research activities as well as commercial and other govern-
ment  visual  analytics  research  into  the  national  lab-oriented  work  of  the
NVAC.
• Established  an  integrated,  national  capability,  called  the  Institute  for  Dis-
crete Sciences (IDS), to investigate and develop the specialized computing al-
gorithms  and  hardware  architectures  necessary  to  analyze  massive  amounts
of  diverse  data  from  multiple,  disparate,  distributed  data  sources,  and  to
model  terrorist  attacks  and  simulate  consequences  on  a  real-time,  high-reso-
lution basis. Like the NVAC, the IDS will have broad interaction and support
from the government, national laboratories and universities.
• Completed an engineering design for the Enhanced International Travel Secu-
rity  (EITS)  system,  initiated  in  FY  2004,  which  will  enable  several  pilots  to

be  implemented  with  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada,  and  Australia.  EITS  al-
lows the validity of travel documents and the identity of travelers to be deter-
mined in real-time at U.S. borders and other points of entry.
• Provided the science and technology needed in the development of biometrics
for  precise  identification  of  individuals,  and  develop  prototype  instrumenta-
tion to aid authorized officials in detecting individuals with potentially hostile
intent.
• Enabled  a  comprehensive  capability  for  determining  terrorist  motivations,
based  on  social,  behavioral,  and  economic  factors.  Integrate  this  with  tech-
niques  for  determining  terrorist  or  hostile  intent  as  well  as  detecting  decep-
tion.

In FY 2006, the Threat and Vulnerability, Testing and Assessment portfolio plans

to:

• Enable the development of analytic resources and technologies to characterize
terrorist  capabilities,  detect  their  activities,  predict  their  intentions  based  on
infrastructure  vulnerabilities,  strengthen  preventive  measures,  and  increase
the ability to respond.
• Provide  an  enhanced,  integrated  capability  for  information  synthesis,  relying
on  a  foundation  of  advanced  semantic  processing  and  visual  analytics  and
supported  by  specialized  discrete  mathematics  techniques  and  technology.
This will provide comprehensive knowledge discovery and dissemination capa-
bilities  to  a  diverse  set  of  users—from  first  responders  to  intelligence  ana-
lysts.
• Develop  a  capability  for  information  extraction,  pattern  discovery,  group  de-
tection, and visualization for unstructured text as well as audio and video in-
formation to complement the existing capability for structured data.
• Continue  expanding  the  roles  of  the  NVAC  and  IDS  by  providing  integrated
capabilities  to  multiple  DHS  components,  setting  national  agendas  in  visual
analytics and discrete sciences, and furthering interagency cooperation.
• Create a National Homeland Security Support System (NH3S) using the AD-
VISE  architecture  and  providing  quantitative  risk  analysis  and  decision  sup-
port capabilities.
• Create  a  CBRNE  threat  encyclopedia  and  integrate  with  the  ADVISE  (Anal-
ysis,  Dissemination,  Visualization,  Insight,  and  Semantic  Enhancement)  sys-
tem. Create a National Homeland Security Support System (NH3S) using the
ADVISE  architecture  and  providing  quantitative  risk  analysis  and  decision
support capabilities.

Standards Program

Ensuring that standards are created and adopted is critically important for home-
land  security.  We  need  consistent  and  verifiable  measures  of  effectiveness  in  terms
of  basic  functionality,  appropriateness  and  adequacy  for  the  task,  inter-operability,
efficiency,  and  sustainability.  Standards  will  improve  the  quality  and  usefulness  of
homeland security systems and technologies. Our Standards Program cuts across all
aspects  of  the  S&T  Directorate’s  mission  and  all  threats  to  improve  effectiveness,
efficiency, and inter-operability of the systems and technologies developed.

Our Standards Program continues to actively engage the federal, State, and local
first  responders  to  ensure  that  developed  standards  are  effective  in  detection,  pre-
vention,  response,  management,  and  attribution.  This  program  office  also  conducts
the  essential  activities  in  order  to  meet  the  requirement  of  the  SAFETY  (Support
Anti-Terrorism  by  Fostering  Effective  Technologies)  Act  in  developing  certification
standards for technologies related to homeland security.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Standards Program:

to the adoption and development of national standards.

• Composed three management directives to establish DHS policy with regards
• Formed  an  interagency  task  force  to  address  the  controversy  over  the  effec-
tiveness  and  use  of  lateral  flow  immunoassays  for  the  detection  of  Bacillus
anthracis (anthrax) by emergency responders.
• Evaluated a five step method to pre-screen suspicious white powders through
an  effort  with  Edgewood  Chemical  Biological  Center  (ECBC)  and  an  addi-
tional  effort  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)
to  look  at  the  effectiveness  of  biological  agent  simulants,  and  the  establish-
ment  of  a  program  to  address  both  chemical  and  biological  decontamination
standards for the first responder community.

• Supported efforts with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to
coordinate the development of a draft standard for hospital preparedness and
to  develop  a  multi-disciplinary  Mission  Essential  Task  List  (METL)  based  on
Emergency  Responder  Guidelines  developed  by  the  Office  of  Domestic  Pre-
paredness.
• Within  Standards  for  Personal  Protective  and  Operational  equipment,  the
program supported the development of a number of respiratory standards in-
cluding  three  National  Institute  for  Occupation  Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH)
standards  and  one  National  Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA)  standard
adopted by DHS in February 2004.

In FY 2006, the Standards Program plans to:

• Continue  to  maintain  and  improve  the  process  by  which  homeland  security
standards are developed and promulgated at the federal level. Incorporate the
appropriate  conformity  assessment  program  development  into  the  standards
development  process.  Maintain  and  update  the  homeland  security  standards
database available to the homeland security community.
• Continue  to  utilize  interagency  working  groups  to  re-evaluate  requirements
and  prioritize  needs  for  CBRNE  countermeasures  standards.  Focus  on  devel-
oping  sampling  protocols  and  guidelines  and  standardized  sample  triage
methods  for  CBRNE  countermeasures.  Focus  on  standards  for  emerging
CBRNE  countermeasures  technologies  including  CBRNE  point  detectors;
CBRNE  stand  off  detectors  and  urban  surveillance  technologies  such  as
BioWatch,  CBRNE  facility  monitors,  and  water  distribution  monitors.  Con-
tinue  programs  to  address  multimodal  biometrics,  latent  fingerprints,  rapid
biometric  evaluations,  and  biometric  image  and  feature  quality.  Also  explore
and  evaluate  ergonomics,  human  factors,  and  usability  issues  of  biometric
sensors, software, and systems.
• Continue  with  the  completion  of  a  standard  guide  for  building  event  disper-
sion  and  health  assessment  preparedness  and  response  planning  and  the
standard  guide  for  conducting  emergency  preparedness  drills  and  exercises.
• Continue current CBRNE personal protective and operational equipment spe-
cifically  focusing  on  completing  the  suite  of  respiratory  protection  equipment
standards to include powered air purifying respirators, closed-circuit self con-
tained  breathing  apparatus,  supplied  air  respirators  and  combination  res-
pirators.

Support to Department of Homeland Security Components

As  I  have  mentioned,  the  operational  components  of  the  Department  are  my  cus-

tomers.

To  ensure  we  meet  customer  needs,  the  S&T  Directorate  has  established  the
Science and Technology Requirements Council (SRC) to bring forward a set of vetted
needs  from  the  entire  Department.  This  is  an  Assistant  Secretary  level  committee
with representation from across DHS that has been chartered to assist in the solici-
tation, validation, and prioritization of all science and technology requirements. This
council  is  intended  to  help  the  S&T  Directorate  identify  those  needs  most  crucial
to  the  DHS  mission  and  to  develop  the  most  effective  S&T  program  possible  using
existing  resources.  As  part  of  their  mission,  the  SRC  reviews  DHS  operational  re-
quirements and needed capabilities that require S&T solutions, and identifies those
opportunities that have cross-cutting technology solutions. Prioritized Departmental
needs  are  then  presented  to  me  as  a  recommendation  for  consideration,  in  conjunc-
tion  with  all  externally  derived  S&T  requirements  (e.g.,  statutory,  national  guid-
ance), for inclusion in the S&T Directorate’s Planning, Programming, and Budgeting
Cycle Guidance.

The  inaugural  meeting  of  the  SRC  took  place  September  30,  2004,  and  was  at-
tended  by  representatives  from  Border  and  Transportation  Security  (BTS),  Emer-
gency Preparedness and Response (EP&R), Information Analysis and Infrastructure
Protection  (IAIP),  the  Office  of  Domestic  Preparedness  (ODP),  U.S.  Citizenship  and
Immigration  Service  (CIS),  U.S.  Coast  Guard  (USCG)  and  U.S.  Secret  Service
(USSS).  Our  initial  meeting  resulted  in  new  requirements  and  a  validation  of  the
needs  that  our  portfolios  had  already  identified  through  their  interactions  with  the
rest  of  the  Department.  It  further  served  to  bring  together  the  many  disparate
groups  from  across  DHS  and  facilitated  a  new  dialogue  that  will  be  necessary  to
produce a successful S&T RDT&E program. The input we received at the September
30,  2004,  meeting  was  used  to  adjust  the  FY  2006  budget  request  and  is  currently
being  integrated  into  our  FY  2007–2011  Planning,  Programming  and  Budgeting
cycle.

I  will  now  address  the  specific  programs  being  conducted  by  our  mission  support

portfolios.
Support to Border and Transportation Security

The Science and Technology Directorate supports all elements of BTS enforcement
and  facilitation  processes  through  identifying  operational  requirements,  developing
mission  capabilities-based  technological  needs,  and  implementing  a  strategic  plan.
We  are  providing  systems  engineering  support  to  various  BTS  programs  including
US VISIT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate’s  support  to  the  BTS  Directorate  is  ac-
complished  by  implementing  a  capabilities-based  technology  planning  process.  The
capabilities-based approach establishes the scope of effort and framework for a tech-
nology  plan.  Through  a  series  of  user  conferences  and  technology  opportunity  con-
ferences, requirements are developed and prioritized for new and improved capabili-
ties.  Operational  personnel  identify  capabilities  and  technology  personnel  identify
potential  development  opportunities.  Capability  gaps  and  possible  technology  solu-
tions  are  proposed,  and  a  budget  is  developed  to  distinguish  between  both  funded
and unfunded needs.

The  Science  &  Technology  Directorate,  in  collaboration  with  BTS,  co-chairs  the
Department’s  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  (UAV)  Working  Group.  This  group  is  cur-
rently focused on developing the Border and Transportation Security operational re-
quirements  for  UAVs  and  related  technologies,  e.g.,  aerostats,  blimps,  lighter  than
air  (LTA)  ships,  and  fixed  and  mobile  towers.  The  UAV  Working  Group  has  identi-
fied  the  following  six  BTS  capability  objectives  that  could  benefit  from  the  utiliza-
tion of UAVs:

• surveillance and monitoring
• communications
• apprehension
• targeting
• intelligence
• deterrence
• officer safety

Based  on  these  high-level  requirements,  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate
is developing concepts of operations and assumptions that will be used in conducting
an  Analysis  of  Alternatives  that  will  include  UAVs  as  well  as  other  technologies.
• Over the past two years, the Science & Technology Directorate has sponsored
two major evaluations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology as part
of the Arizona Border Control Initiative.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Border and Transportation Security R&D portfolio:
• Issued  a  solicitation  for  an  Advanced  Container  Security  Device  to  develop
and  field  test  (within  the  Directorate’s  CounterMeasures  Test  Bed)  the  next
generation  of  shipping  container  security  devices,  building  on  the  current  ef-
forts through Operation Safe Commerce as well as current Border and Trans-
portation  Security  policy  efforts  to  develop  and  implement  performance  re-
quirements  for  container  security.  The  Advanced  Container  Security  Device
program  is  part  of  a  ‘‘Future  Smart  Container’’  initiative  encompassing  con-
tainer security, communications, and data systems for the future.
• Supported  the  BTS  Directorate  in  putting  technology  in  the  field  to  support
the Arizona Border Control Initiative. The portfolio demonstrated other tech-
nologies  such  as  a  long-range  acoustic  device  that  allows  agents  to  commu-
nicate from a safer standoff distance to determine the intent of people.
• Continued  development  and  refinement  of  BTS  technology  requirements  and
planning. Using a capabilities-based process, the portfolio’s goal was to ensure
that federal technology planners understood the capabilities that BTS agents
and  officers  view  as  essential  for  mission  success  and  to  help  planners  focus
technology development on filling the identified gaps in those capabilities.
• Developed the BTS Technology Vision which include Border Watch, Transpor-
tation Watch and Border Net which significantly improves our ability to pro-
vide  the  information  necessary  to  secure  our  borders.  The  foundation  of  the
vision  is  an  architecture  and  a  set  of  technology  programs  that  will  gather,
process  and  distribute  real-time  knowledge  of  the  border  and  transportation
situation  and  provide  decision  support  tools  and  labor  saving  devices  for  our
security forces.

In FY 2006, the Border and Transportation Security R&D portfolio plans to:

• Build  on  the  sensor  trade  studies  and  modeling  conducted  in  FY  2005  to  de-
velop and test advanced sensor suites including improved visual and non-vis-
ual  sensors  (video,  infrared,  seismic,  acoustic  and  radar).  These  sensors  may
be  deployed  on  the  ground,  at  sea,  and  in  the  air.  In  addition,  evaluate  data
produced  by  Ports-of-Entry  (POE)  inspectors,  such  as  traffic  and  incident  in-
formation,  along  with  data  produced  by  border  inspection  systems  will  be
evaluated as part of the surveillance system.
• Build  on  the  design  and  development  effort  accomplished  in  FY  2005  on  the
next  generation  of  container  security  and  communications  systems  to  detect
intrusion, location, contents and tampering. The requirements for this system
include  recording  and  reporting  location;  detection  of  intrusion  and  commu-
nication of log history, and sensor and inspection data.
• Integrate  Transportation  Watch  capabilities  across  the  transportation  do-
mains enabling a Common Operational Picture (COP) across the entire trans-
portation  environment.  Extensive  data  sharing,  including  the  ability  to  dis-
cover  links  in  criminal  or  suspicious  activities  across  domains  will  be  a  key
requirement to providing an effective Transportation COP.
• Initiate  development  and  integration  of  smart  portals  and  sensors  for  detec-
tion  of  explosive  threats  to  shipping.  Utilize  rapid  prototyping  processes,  fo-
cusing initially on passenger and vehicle ferries.
• Define  system  architecture  that  fully  supports  the  Border  Watch  Common
Operational  Picture  with  multi-modal  access  to  essential  databases,  remote
communications and intelligence fusion.

Support to Emergency Preparedness and Response

The  S&T  Directorate’s  Emergency  Preparedness  and  Response  (EP&R)  portfolio
supports  the  Department’s  EP&R  Directorate  with  a  mission  to  improve  the  ability
of  the  Nation  to  prepare  for,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  all-hazards  emergencies
through  development  and  deployment  of  enabling  capabilities.  Particular  emphasis
is placed on technology integration at all levels of government, detection and moni-
toring systems for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE)
threats,  and  long-term  sustained  performance  and  inter-operability  enhancement  of
State  and  local  preparedness.  The  most  important  customers  of  EP&R  technologies
are the federal, State and local emergency responders and emergency managers who
are  first  into  an  emergency  zone  and  often  last  to  leave.  Specific  objectives  of  the
portfolio are to:

operational end-users;

• Identify and develop relevant technology solutions through partnerships with

In  FY  2004  and  FY  2005,  the  Emergency  Preparedness  and  Response  R&D  port-

folio:

• Initiated operation of the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment
Center  (IMAAC)  and  supported  the  National  Exercise  Program  and  special
events, such as the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. IMAAC
established  connectivity  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  Operations
Center and the FEMA National Emergency Operations Center to provide near
real time hazards predictions for airborne releases.
• Selected four urban areas for the pilot of the Regional Technology Integration
(RTI)  Initiative.  These  locations  provide  an  opportunity  to  evaluate  geo-
graphic  and  governance  diversity  as  well  as  variability  in  threats  and
vulnerabilities.  Initiated  an  integrated  assessment  process  in  collaboration
with these communities.
• Focused  activities  on  the  identification  of  simulation  based  training  and  edu-
cation  requirements  through  interaction  with  the  responder  community.  The
portfolio leveraged the work initiated by Office of Domestic Preparedness and
the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, the National Institute
of  Justice  and  the  Department  of  Defense  in  identifying  needs  and  gaps  as
well as existing technology development programs that can be utilized for in-
cident management training

In  FY  2006,  the  Emergency  Preparedness  and  Response  R&D  portfolio  plans  to:
• Leverage  federal  resources  to  provide  dynamic  venue  for  collaborative  re-
search, development, testing and evaluation of atmospheric transport and dis-
persion  (ATD)  models  for  hazards  predictions.  IMAAC  will  host  researchers
from throughout the Nation at its facility as well as participate in virtual col-
laboration both nationally and internationally.
• Complete  implementation  of  technology  systems  solutions  for  the  first  four
pilot  locations  of  the  RTI  initiative;  prepare  test  and  evaluation  plans  and
conduct  operational  readiness  exercises  to  evaluate  the  overall  system  per-
formance.
• Develop  the  system  requirements  that  support  national,  inter-operable  sim-
ulation  based  training  and  exercise.  This  capability  will  focus  on  large  scale,
multi-jurisdictional incidents and will facilitate the implementation of the Na-
tional Incident Management System and the National Preparedness Goal.
• Demonstrate  several  revolutionary  and  highly  innovative  materials  for  emer-
gency  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  applications.  Demonstrate  proto-
type  material/technologies  that  can  that  can  be  made  into  functional  gar-
ments and/or integrated personal protective systems will be demonstrated.
• Initiate  an  Advanced  Concept  Technology  Demonstration  of  a  candidate  Uni-
fied Incident Command (UIC) architecture that will achieve revolutionary ad-
vances in Unified Incident Command and Decision Support and bring analyt-
ical  tools  to  bear  on  real-time  information  in-flows  and  out-flows  for  incident
commanders  and  emergency  responders.  Advanced  capability  will  be  applica-
ble to a variety of response paradigms, including single incidents, multiple si-
multaneous  incidents,  long  duration  response  and  recovery  operations,  and
large-scale public health events.

Support to United States Coast Guard

The mission of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) R&D portfolio is to develop
technology  and  systems  to  provide  the  capability  to  safeguard  lives,  property  and
environment from intentional and accidental maritime threats and protect maritime
mobility  through  the  free  flow  of  goods  and  people  while  maximizing  the  rec-
reational use of the Nation’s waterways.

The USCG R&D portfolio covers the Homeland Security (HLS) and Non-HLS mis-
sions  performed  by  Coast  Guard  operational  forces.  HLS  priorities  include  research
programs that address a defense in depth, or layered approach, to Maritime Domain
Awareness, Prevention/Protection, Response and the management, analysis and dis-
tribution  of  information,  (e.g.,  Sea  Guardian,  Coastal  Shield,  Port  Protector  and
Smart Commander). Similarly, USCG non-HLS mission research needs (e.g., Search
& Rescue, Maritime Oil Spill Response, Aquatic Nuisance Species, Waterways Navi-
gation,  etc.)  are  addressed  through  programs  like  Safe  Voyage,  Clean  Sweep,  ANS
Eradicator  and  Able  Navigator.  Together  these  programs  support  the  five  Strategic
Goals of the USCG (Maritime Safety, Protection of Natural Resources, Maritime Se-
curity, National Defense, and Maritime Mobility).

The  USCG  portfolio  expects  in  FY  2006  to  see  the  continuation  of  HLS  mission

research in the following areas:

small prop-driven vessels and in port swimmers/divers.

classification and prediction capability for vessel intent with a port area.

• Situational  Awareness  for  Maritime  Domain  Awareness—develop  automated
• Compel  Compliance—field  new  capability  to  communicate  and  stop  at-sea
• Boarding Capability—improve space accountability for non-ferrous vessels.
• Personnel  Alerting  and  Contraband  Detection  and  Identification—adapt
breakthrough. Technologies in CBRNE countermeasures for the maritime en-
vironment.

For non-HLS mission support, this portfolio will continue to place its highest pri-
orities  on  high-risk,  high-reward  research  and  development  relevant  to  the  Coast
Guard’s  traditional  mission  set  that  might  not  otherwise  be  addressed  in  order  to
enhance operational components within the Coast Guard. Non-HLS mission support
will address Coast Guard Strategic Goals (i.e., Maritime Safety, Security and Mobil-
ity,  and  Protection  of  Natural  Resources)  through  RDT&E  efforts  that  will  provide
increased  knowledge,  capability  and  performance  improvements  in  the  following
areas:

• Aquatic  Nuisance  Species  Eradication:  non-invasive  treatment  of  ballast

water;

• Oil Spill Detection & Response: fielding of new technology, equipment and de-
vices to detect subsurface and submerged (heavy) oils from standoff distances;
• Rapid  Hazardous  Material  (HAZMAT)  Response  Information:  evaluate  air-
borne detection capability for heavy oil spills and identify Commercial-off-the-
Shelf  (COTS)  technologies  for  HAZMAT  identification  by  USCG  inspection
personnel; and
• Search & Rescue: incorporate environmental/meteorological data into CODAR
improving  current  analysis  and  short-term  forecasting  for  target  movement
and  search  area  predictions;  develop  improved  Last  Known  Position  esti-
mators in support of USCG Search Area Planners resulting in reduced search
areas and increasing survivability of persons lost at sea.

Support to the United States Secret Service

The  mission  of  the  United  States  Secret  Service  (USSS)  portfolio  of  the  S&T  Di-
rectorate  is  intended  to  support  the  unique  USSS  mission  by  development  and  de-
ployment of advanced technologies to enhance protective and investigative capabili-
ties. This portfolio is coordinated with the United States Secret Service and has es-
tablished  its  first  direct-funded  R&D  program.  The  USSS  portfolio  effort  focuses
upon  input  from  the  intelligence  community  (threat  based  model)  and  direct  oper-
ational  experience  obtained  over  the  last  century.  As  a  result,  this  funded  tech-
nology  program  is  subject  to  re-evaluation  and  change  based  upon  the  perceived
threats to the safety of those protected by the USSS.

In  2004,  the  portfolio  addressed  four  projects/programs.  The  Emerging  Threats
Program  supports  the  Secret  Service’s  continuing,  comprehensive  assessments  of
emerging threats and evolving technologies that pose a threat to dignitaries and as-
sets  protected  by  USSS  personnel.  The  Law  Enforcement  Virtual-Reality  Training
Model program supports prototyping and deployment of a law enforcement security-
oriented  simulation  training  system  for  the  USSS-specific  training  and  modeling.
Additionally,  this  system  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  emergency  responders
during  actual  events.  The  Critical  Structure  Protective  Initiative  (CSPI)  program
will  ensure  continued  research  and  development  of  network  protection  systems  and
procedures  designed  to  mitigate  exploitation  of  site-specific  ‘‘Very  Large  Scale  Inte-
gration’’  (VLSI)  control  architectures.  The  Wireless  Tracking  Device  program  sup-
ports development of a handheld, man-portable wireless tracking device for locating
operators  of  wireless  communication  device(s)  in  difficult  radio  frequency  environ-
ments such as an office building or event stadium.

In FY 2006, the U.S. Secret Service Portfolio plans to continue development of ap-
propriate  escape  hood  technology,  begin  the  development  of  a  mobile  platform  that
will  be  required  to  detect,  exploit,  and  defend  against  covert  and  overt  electronic
surveillance systems, continue (given a successful proof of concept in FY 2005) with
the  development  of  a  ubiquitous  mobile  computing  system  that  would  allow  secure
wireless  networked  communication  between  unlike  devices  with  high  fidelity  data
transmission;  and  initiate  an  Optical  &  Chemical  Tagging/Tracking  Project  under
this  program.  This  project’s  objective  will  be  the  development  of  optical  and  chem-
ical tags that are robust and covertly deployable.
Homeland Security University and Fellowship Programs

In this portfolio we seek to develop a broad research capability within the Nation’s
universities  to  address  scientific  and  technological  issues  related  to  homeland  secu-
rity. The portfolio places a high priority on developing academic programs and sup-
porting students in order to build learning and research environments in key areas
of Departmental interest.

In  FY  2004,  the  Homeland  Security  University  Programs  established  three  Cen-

ters of Excellence:

• The Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events, at the Uni-
versity  of  Southern  California  and  its  partners  will  receive  $12  million  over
three  years  to  evaluate  the  risks,  costs  and  consequences  of  terrorism  and  to
guide economically viable investments in countermeasures.
• The  National  Center  for  Foreign  Animal  and  Zoonotic  Disease  Defense  at
Texas  A&M  and  its  partners  will  receive  $18  million  over  three  years  to  ad-
dress  potential  threats  to  animal  agriculture  including  Foot  and  Mouth  Dis-
ease,  Rift  Valley  fever,  Avian  influenza  and  Brucellosis.  In  addition  to  work-
ing  closely  with  industry  and  government,  they  will  work  with  DHS’s  Plum
Island Animal Disease Center.
• The  National  Center  for  Food  Protection  and  Defense  at  the  University  of
Minnesota and its partners will receive $15 million over three years to estab-

lish best practices and attract new researchers to manage and respond to food
contamination events, both intentional and naturally occurring.

In  FY  2005,  DHS  announced  the  selection  of  the  University  of  Maryland  (UMD)
and its partners as the Center for Behavioral and Social Research on Terrorism and
Counter-Terrorism.  This  Center  will  be  funded  at  $12  million  for  three  years  fol-
lowing contract award

During late FY 2005 and early FY 2006, the S&T Directorate expects to establish
at  least  three  additional  Centers  of  Excellence.  Each  Center  is  awarded  an  initial
three-year grant whose annual cost we account for in our planning.

As part of the Department’s mission to maximize collaboration with other federal
agencies,  University  Programs  and  EPA’s  Science  to  Achieve  Results  (STAR)  Pro-
gram  have  collaborated  on  the  topic  of  microbial  risk  assessment.  The  DHS–EPA
cooperative  Center  on  Microbial  Risk  Assessment  will  result  in  one  five-year  grant
to  a  university-based  consortium  will  be  jointly  funded  by  both  agencies  for  a  total
of $10 million.

Last  fall,  University  Programs  selected  approximately100  students  for  the  2004
class of DHS Scholars and Fellows bringing the total of students to about 200. Stu-
dents  from  the  2003  and  2004  class  participated  in  a  DHS  orientation  for  the  pur-
pose  of  learning  about  DHS  mission  objectives,  the  critical  research  needs,  and
meeting  scientists  from  DHS  laboratories,  Centers  of  Excellence  and  DOE  national
laboratories.  Students  from  both  classes  are  attending  93  institutions  (including
Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities/Minority  Serving  Institutions)  in  38
states and the District of Columbia. Seventeen of the institutions are located in Ex-
perimental  Program  to  Stimulate  Competitive  Research  (EPSCoR)  states.  Besides
making  immediate  contributions  to  homeland  security-related  R&D,  these  students
will  be  part  of  the  development  of  a  broad  research  capability  within  the  Nation’s
universities  to  address  scientific  and  technological  issues  related  to  homeland  secu-
rity.

Beginning  in  FY  2006,  the  steady  state  of  up  to  300  highly  talented  and  diverse

students will be maintained.
Emerging Threats

It is truly the threats we do not yet know that are often the most terrifying. Our
Emerging  Threats  portfolio  addresses  the  dynamic  nature  of  terrorist  threats,  as
science  and  technology  advancements  enable  new  agents  of  harm  and  new  ways  to
employ  them.  This  portfolio  places  high  priority  on  developing  the  capability  to  use
innovative,  crosscutting,  out-of-the-box  approaches  for  anticipating  and  responding
to new and emerging threats. Successful identification of emerging threats will per-
mit  capabilities  to  be  developed  to  thwart  these  emerging  threats  before  they  are
used.

Relevant  R&D  is  underway  at  other  agencies  and  organizations;  thus,  partner-
ships  in  this  area  hold  great  potential  for  synergistic  focus  on  homeland  security.
Work is being done and will continue to be pursued in partnership with the Depart-
ments of Energy, Defense, Justice, and Agriculture, the intelligence community, and
the National Institutes of Health.

In FY 2004 and 2005, the Emerging Threats portfolio:

• Established  informal  partnerships  with  the  intelligence  community  and  with
the  USSS  portfolio  to  leverage  ongoing  activities  in  support  of  over-the-hori-
zon assessment.
• Initiated  efforts,  in  combination  with  Rapid  Prototyping,  in  both  near-term
and  breakthrough  solutions  to  homeland  security  issues.  Near-term  projects
are  funded  out  of  the  Rapid  Prototyping  Portfolio.  Breakthrough  projects  are
funded from the Emerging Threats Portfolio.
• Held a privacy protection workshop in which the technical and policy commu-
nities  interacted  to  identify  important  technical  challenges  and  high  impact
solution areas. Information from this workshop will form the basis of upcom-
ing programs in this area.
• Analyzed  multiple  radar  technologies  and  other  surveillance  strategies  to  de-
termine which combination of technologies would best support coastal surveil-
lance by the USCG.
• Conducted  three  sensitive  projects,  two  in  collaboration  with  the  USSS  and
• Sponsored  studies  at  the  Homeland  Security  Institute  to  identify  threat  and
technology  trends  and  develop  a  framework  for  analyzing  emerging  and  fu-
ture threats to homeland security.

In FY 2006, the Emerging Threats portfolio plans to:

• Sponsor  comprehensive  assessments  to  identify  and  prioritize  emerging
threats. The outcomes of the assessments lead the strategic programs to inte-
grate multiple disciplines and threat scenarios and comprehensively use intel-
ligence-based information to establish organizational foresight.
• Fund  research  dedicated  to  long-term,  undefined  threats  as  a  means  to  exer-
cise  technology  influence  in  the  marketplace  and  build  infrastructure  to
incentivize non-requirements driven, high-risk, high-payoff R&D, thereby pro-
moting technology push and collaboration to solve otherwise intractable prob-
lems.
• Complete development of projects initiated in FY 2005, and test and evaluate
the  products  from  these  projects.  Develop  technologies  and  systems  against
emerging threats identified as a result of FY 2005 emerging threats analysis.

Rapid Prototyping

By  accelerating  the  time  needed  to  develop  and  commercialize  relevant  tech-
nologies,  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  will  ensure  that  operational  end-
users  will  be  better  able  to  prevent  terrorist  attacks,  reduce  the  Nation’s  vulner-
ability, and minimize the damage and assist in recovery if attacks occur. Our Rapid
Prototyping  portfolio  advances  the  Directorate’s  mission  to  conduct,  stimulate  and
enable  RDT&E  and  timely  transition  of  homeland  security  capabilities  to  federal,
State and local operational end-users.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Rapid Prototyping portfolio:

• Solicited ideas, concepts and technologies for 50 requirement areas of interest
to both the Department and other agencies. Initiated efforts to address chem-
ical  and  biological  threats,  explosive  detection,  training  technology  tools,  im-
provised  nuclear  device  defeat,  and  investigative  and  forensic  support  topics.
• Developed  a  joint  port  and  coastal  surveillance  prototype  designated  HAWK-
EYE with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) that provides an integrated
maritime  surveillance  system  covering  Port  Everglades,  Miami,  and  Key
West, Florida. This first-of-its-kind integrated command center and maritime
surveillance facility opened in July 2004.
• Initiated  the  implementation  of  the  Technology  Clearinghouse  as  required  in
the  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002.  This  clearinghouse  serves  as  the  central
nexus to the public safety and first responder community on: (1) Information
services supporting access to, and dissemination of, information regarding in-
novative technologies serving the DHS mission; (2) Resources designed to sup-
port  the  collaborative  needs  of  teams  serving  the  mission  of  DHS;  and  (3)
Technology programs and resources themselves, designed to serve the mission
of DHS and distributed via a central DHS mechanism.

In FY 2006, the Rapid Prototyping portfolio plans to:

• Transition mature programs from the development phase to operational test-
ing  and  evaluation  programs  and  commercial  or  government  entities  for  de-
ployment. Identify new technology candidates and capabilities to meet the ex-
isting and emergent technical requirements of the Department.
• Continue  support  of  the  Technology  Clearinghouse  in  FY  2006  and  continue
to fund projects initiated under the Near Term and Future Technologies solic-
itation released in FY 2004.
• Complete  the  development  of  projects,  within  the  Support  to  State  and  Local
Responders  project,  initiated  in  FY  2005,  and  test  and  evaluate  the  products
from these projects.

Counter–MANPADS

The  Counter–MANPADS  program  is  focused  on  demonstrating  the  viability,  eco-
nomic  costs,  and  effectiveness  of  adapting  existing  military  technology  to  protect
commercial  aircraft  from  the  threat  of  Man  Portable  Air  Defense  Systems
(MANPADS).  The  major  thrust  of  this  program  is  to  demonstrate  and  evaluate  the
possible  migration  of  existing  technologies  to  the  commercial  airline  industry,  not
to develop new technologies. The resulting countermeasure systems must have mini-
mal  impact  on  air  carrier  and  airport  operations,  maintenance,  and  support  activi-
ties.  The  re-engineering  of  existing  countermeasure  technologies  and  components  is
necessary  to  meet  commercial  air  carrier  operation  requirements,  including  protec-
tion  of  critical  military  technology.  The  program  balances  cost,  schedule,  and  per-
formance with the needs and requirements of the aviation community stakeholders.

Upon  completion  of  a  two-phase  analysis,  prototype  and  testing  program,  DHS  will
provide  the  Administration  and  Congress  with  a  recommendation  for  the  most  via-
ble solution to defend against shoulder-fired missiles.

To  mature  the  reliability  of  the  underlying  military  technology  to  commercial
standards,  validate  system  effectiveness  and  suitability  in  an  operational  environ-
ment,  and  to  develop  and  implement  a  comprehensive  approach  to  technology  pro-
tection, a follow-on Phase III has been planned. Phase III will include delivery and
installation of pre-production Counter–MANPADS equipment on commercially oper-
ated aircraft by U.S. cargo carriers similar to those aircraft dedicated to meet Civil
Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) requirements. This will integrate a limited number of sys-
tems  on  multiple  airframes  in  actual  revenue  service  across  the  different  carriers
for the purpose of operational testing and evaluation, data collection, and the certifi-
cation of a number of different aircraft types. Phase III remains subject to approval
by the Administration and Congress.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Counter–MANPADS program:

• Initiated and completed Phase I following a competitive bidding process. DHS
awarded  Other  Transaction  (OT)  for  Prototype  Agreements  (OTA)  to  three
companies—BAE  Systems,  Northrop  Grumman,  and  United  Airlines—for
Phase I of a two-year System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) effort.
The  contractors  focused  on  proving  the  feasibility  of  migrating  existing  DOD
technology  into  the  commercial  sector  and  exploring  other  technology  as  ap-
propriate. Following Preliminary Design Reviews with all three companies in
July  2004,  the  Phase  I  portion  of  the  twenty-four  month  SD&D  effort  con-
cluded  and  DHS  initiated  a  selection  evaluation  process  to  determine  which
of the three companies would be selected to further mature their preliminary
designs, build representative prototypes, install them on aircraft, and conduct
formal testing during the Phase II eighteen month effort.
• Involved  the  stakeholder  community  beginning  in  FY  2004.  In  late  2004,  the
Program  Office  hosted  a  Stakeholders’  Meeting,  attended  by  representatives
of  the  airlines,  the  equipment  manufacturers,  and  other  affected  sectors,  in-
cluding  representatives  of  multiple  Federal  Government  Departments  and
Agencies.

In FY 2006, the Counter–MANPADS program plans to:

• Build,  deliver,  install,  and  fly  pre-production  Counter–MANPADS  equipment
on  commercially-operated  aircraft  by  U.S.  cargo  carriers  similar  to  those  air-
craft used for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) operations.
• Conduct  operational  testing  and  evaluation  and  data  collection  on  multiple
aircraft  types  to  capture  operational  and  maintenance  costs  as  well  as  tech-
nical  performance  and  reliability  data  in  a  commercial  operational  environ-
ment.
• Modify Phase II systems to incorporate new design requirements including re-
liability,  technology  protection,  and  emergency  ground  notification  improve-
ments based on test and evaluation results.
• Examine  maintaining  two  contractors  in  Phase  III  to  foster  competition,  and
• Conduct  an  aggressive  reliability  growth  effort  to  increase  system  reliability
• During FY 2006, conduct Live-Fire Test and Evaluation assessment.
• Continue  on-going  dialogues  with  Original  Equipment  Manufacturers  (OEM)
such  as  Boeing  and  Airbus  and  conduct  studies  to  scope  the  effort  required
to  include  provisions  for  Counter–MANPADS  systems  on  future  production
aircraft.
• Pursue  Federal  Aviation  Administration  certification  for  additional  aircraft

Office of SAFETY Act Implementation

The  mission  of  the  Office  of  SAFETY  Act  Implementation  (OSAI)  is  to  evaluate
technologies  submitted  to  it  by  applicants  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set  forth
in  the  Support  Anti-terrorism  by  Fostering  Effective  Technologies  Act  of  2002
(SAFETY  Act)  and  Interim  Regulations.  As  part  of  the  Homeland  Security  Act  of
2002, Public Law 107–296, Congress enacted the SAFETY Act to provide ‘‘risk man-
agement’’  and  ‘‘litigation  management’’  protections  for  sellers  of  qualified  anti-ter-
rorism  technologies.  The  purpose  of  the  Act  is  to  encourage  the  development  and
deployment of anti-terrorism technologies (ATT) that will substantially enhance the

protection of the Nation. Specifically, the SAFETY Act creates certain liability limi-
tations  for  ‘‘claims  arising  out  of,  relating  to,  or  resulting  from  an  act  of  terrorism’’
where qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed.

Although there are many technologies that are important to protecting our home-
land,  the  SAFETY  Act  Designation  and  Certification  are  designed  to  support  effec-
tive technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of ter-
rorism,  or  limiting  the  harm  that  such  acts  might  otherwise  cause,  and  which  also
meet other prescribed criteria.

OSAI  evaluations  are  designed  to  generate  advice  to  the  Under  Secretary  on  the
appropriateness  of  granting  protections  under  the  SAFETY  Act.  In  support  of  this
mission,  OSAI  undertakes  efforts  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  the
protections available under the SAFETY Act. In addition, OSAI coordinates its proc-
ess  with  other  offices  within  DHS  and  other  federal  agencies  to  both  support  those
offices in their missions and to minimize the burden on applicants for SAFETY Act
protections.

The Department moved quickly to create OSAI. In July 2003, a notice of proposed
rulemaking  was  published  for  comment,  and  on  October  16,  2003,  an  interim  rule
was published with a request for public comments, thus implementing the program.
Facilities  to  house  the  program  were  selected  and  OSAI  has  identified  and  entered
into agreements with the lead implementation contractor and lead web site develop-
ment/management contactor. OSAI designed and implemented a web-based applica-
tion kit and process with an interactive help desk. OSAI executed a robust outreach
program  to  introduce  the  industry  to  the  SAFETY  Act  program  and  to  encourage
its  participation.  OSAI  has  received  and  has  responded  to  72  full  applications  and
166  pre-applications.  Four  applicants  have  been  awarded  SAFETY  Act  designation
and  certification:  Northrop  Grumman;  Michael  Stapleton  Associates;  Teledyne
Brown Engineering; and Lockheed Martin.

The Office intends to refine its operations throughout FY 2005. OSAI, in consulta-
tion with the Department’s Office of the General Counsel, has been revising the In-
terim  Rule  based  on  the  comments  received  from  the  public  and  our  experiences
with  applicants  over  the  past  year.  OSAI  will  revise  the  application  kit  to  make  it
clearer  and  more  user-friendly,  and  will  work  to  streamline  the  process  based  on
lessons  learned  from  the  previous  year.  The  number  of  applications  is  expected  to
increase significantly with the introduction of the revised kit, implementation of the
Final Rule, and higher visibility.

In  FY  2006,  OSAI  plans  to  expand  its  coordination  of  the  program  with  pending
federal,  State,  and  local  procurements.  It  also  plans  to  work  with  recognized  pro-
curement  organizations  and  appropriate  industry  associations  to  educate  them  on
the availability of SAFETY Act protections to potential vendors.
Office of Inter-operability and Compatibility

The  Office  of  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility  (OIC),  managed  by  the  S&T  Di-
rectorate,  was  tasked  to  lead  the  planning  and  implementation  efforts  in  coordina-
tion  with  other  DHS  programs.  It  oversees  the  wide  range  of  public  safety  inter-
operability  programs  and  efforts  currently  spread  across  Homeland  Security.  These
programs address critical inter-operability issues relating to public safety and emer-
gency  response,  including  communications,  equipment,  training,  and  other  areas  as
needs are identified.

Creating  inter-operability  requires  coordination  and  partnerships  among  man-
agers,  partners,  and  stakeholders  at  all  levels  of  government.  OIC  will  establish
partnerships  with  all  relevant  offices  and  agencies  to  ensure  that  the  programs  ad-
dress  all  possible  issues  related  to  public  safety  inter-operability  and  compatibility.
These  partners  and  additional  relevant  stakeholders  include  representatives  from
the  emergency  response  providers  represented  by  their  national  associations,  State
and  local  government  agencies,  DHS  and  other  Federal  Government  agencies,
standards development organizations, and industry.

Since October 2004, the OIC has interviewed key stakeholders across federal and
practitioner  communities  to  validate  findings,  uncover  additional  inter-operability
initiatives,  and  determine  key  issues  for  first  response;  identified  a  core  group  of
federal  programs  that  test  and  evaluate  first  responder  equipment;  began  devel-
oping a plan to establish a Joint Evaluation and Testing Program to coordinate with
other  federal  agencies;  and  conducted  an  initial  scan  of  existing  programs  for  first
responders and collected information at the local, State, and federal levels.

versity,  Western  Kentucky  University,  Northern  Kentucky  University,  More-
head  State  University,  Murray  State  University,  Kentucky  State  University
and the Kentucky Community & Technical College System.

In FY 2006, the Critical Infrastructure Protection R&D portfolio plans to:

• Incorporate  a  fully  parameterized  metropolitan  area  modeling  capability  into
the  CIP–DSS.  Integrate  adversary-defender  constraint  and  information  dy-
namics models into CIP–DSS. Add an enhanced threat spectrum capability to
CIP–DSS  and  complete  pilot  tests  of  the  CIP–DSS  in  several  State  and  re-
gional areas.
• Publish  the  National  Academy  Study  on  Security  of  the  Electrical  Industry.
• Complete  the  quick-look  system  studies  of  all  14  Critical  Infrastructures  and
Key  Resources,  and  the  end-to-end  System  Study  for  Municipal  Domestic
Water Security.
• Deliver  improved  closed  circuit  TV  (CCTV)  components  for  object  identifica-
tion  and  behavior  recognition.  Deliver  an  enhanced  threat  detection  CCTV

proved CCTV components.
• Deliver the second annual National CIP R&D Plan with agency budget infor-
mation  and  a  roadmap  for  deliverables.  Incorporate  relevant  inputs  from:  a)
federal agencies including activities, and levels of effort; b) critical infrastruc-
ture  sector  owners  and  operators;  and  c)  private  and  public  research  institu-
tions and universities.

Cyber Security R&D Portfolio

The  Cyber  Security  R&D  Portfolio  supports  the  mission  of  the  Information  Anal-
ysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate and is focused on leading cyber secu-
rity research, development; testing and evaluation endeavors to secure the Nation’s
critical information infrastructure through coordinated efforts that will improve the
security  of  the  existing  cyber  infrastructure,  and  provide  a  foundation  for  a  more
secure  infrastructure.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  focusing  on  R&D  aimed  at  pre-
venting,  protecting  against,  detecting,  responding  to,  and  recovering  from  large-
scale,  high-impact  cyber  attacks,  supporting  the  development  and  accelerating  the
deployment  and  use  of  more  secure  Internet  communication  protocols,  addressing
cyber security R&D needs that are unique to critical infrastructure sectors, and pro-
vide novel and next-generation secure information technology concepts and architec-
tures.

In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the Cyber Security R&D portfolio:

• Initiated  dialog  aimed  at  international  collaboration  on  cyber  security  R&D
with  Canada,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Japan.  Interactions  with  the  United
Kingdom  and  Japan  are  at  early  stages  and  have  not  yet  reached  the  point
where potential joint R&D activities have been identified.

• Worked  with  federal  researchers  and  officials  and  the  private  sector  to  de-
velop  a  roadmap  to  accelerate  the  development  and  deployment  of  a  secure
domain  name  infrastructure.  Current  work  also  includes  the  identification  of
technology  requirements  and  development  of  models  to  aid  in  assessing  the
performance  impact  of  utilizing  Domain  Name  System  Security  Extensions
(DNSSEC) in operational environments.

• Initiated a program to address different facets of the need for improved meth-
ods  for  cyber  security  assessment  and  testing,  in  order  to  provide  a  founda-
tion for the long-term goal of economically-informed risk-based cyber security
decision-making.

• Provide  technical  support  funding  through  the  ‘‘virtual’’  Cyber  Security  R&D
Center  for  the  S&T  Directorate  in  pre-research  activities  (such  as  developing
roadmaps, organizing workshops and meetings, aiding in drafting research so-
licitations  and  proposal  review),  as  well  as  post-research  activities  (such  as
facilitating pilot tests and exercises, venture capital community outreach, pri-
vate  sector  outreach,  and  interfacing  with  non-government  R&D  commu-
nities).

In FY 2006, the Cyber Security portfolio plans to:

• Continue  to  provide  support  to  the  Directorate  through  the  ‘‘virtual’’  Cyber
Security  R&D  Center  in  pre-research  activities  and  post-research  activities.
FY 2006 activities will have a significant focus on private sector and venture
capital community outreach.

• Initiate a new two-year R&D program phase, again overlapping with the pro-
gram  started  in  FY  2005.  As  the  FY  2004  program  comes  to  a  close  in  FY
2006,  progress  against  the  FY  2004  technical  topic  areas  will  be  evaluated.
• Complete  full-scale  operational  test  bed,  acquisition  and  generation  of  net-
work data sets, enhancement of remote management and configuration capa-
bilities, and a final project report.

• Focus  on  system-level  DNSSEC  implementation,  with  the  development  of
software  reference  implementations  for  servers  and  client  applications,  and
planning for pilot deployments of DNSSEC. Direct investments in the area of
routing  protocol  security  at  the  development  of  a  modeling  and  simulation
framework  for  impact  assessment  of  secure  routing  protocols  on  the  Internet
performance.

• Focus on pursuing partnerships that allow broader non-government participa-
tion,  accompanied  by  a  greater  role  of  non-government  organizations  and
funding  sharing  responsibility  for  oversight  and  financial  support  for  this  ca-
pability.

R&D Consolidation

Funds originally requested by the U.S. Coast Guard to support operations, main-
tenance and salaries for the assigned science staff for the Coast Guard Research and
Development Center will be integrated into the Science and Technology Directorate
mission  space  to  support  the  continued  operations  and  scientific  activities  at  the
Coast  Guard  Research  and  Development  Center.  Funds  originally  requested  by  the
Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  to  support  salaries  for  those  assigned  to  the
Research, Development, and Evaluation Branch will likewise be integrated into the
S&T Directorate mission

In  FY  2006,  DHS’s  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  will  unite  the  RDT&E
functions of the existing S&T explosives countermeasures portfolio along with those
of  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  program.  The  resulting  integrated
portfolio will then encompass and support the true objective of the explosives coun-
termeasures  technology  program:  to  prevent,  detect,  respond,  and  mitigate  the  use
of  explosives  in  attacks  against  the  population,  mass  transit,  civil  aviation,  critical
infrastructure  and  key  assets.  This  consolidation  allows  for  an  expansion  of  the
scope  and  number  of  programs  within  the  explosives  countermeasures  portfolio  in
comparison  to  the  current  FY  2004  and  FY  2005  and  planned  FY  2006  activities.
Programs  include  explosives  marking,  smuggling,  aviation  security,  suicide  bomb
interdiction, and vehicle bomb interdiction.

FY 2006 Science and Technology Directorate Initiatives

92

The  S&T  budget  request  includes  funding  for  a  number  of  mission-critical  initia-

tives.

• National Bio and Agrodefense Facility [$23 million]

The  National  Bio  and  Agrodefense  Facility  (NBAF)  will  extend  the  capabili-
ties  of  the  National  Biodefense  Analysis  and  Countermeasures  Center
(NBACC)  for  threat  characterization,  forensics,  and  detection  to  defend  both
animal  and  public  health.  Research,  development,  test  and  evaluation  at  the
NBAF  will  strengthen  the  Nation’s  ability  to  anticipate,  prevent,  respond  to,
and  recover  from  the  intentional  introduction  of  high  consequence  biological
threats, such as Foreign Animal Diseases. The S&T Directorate will focus on
developing and testing the technical means to prevent attacks on agriculture
and humans and strengthening the capability to respond to an attack, recover
from an attack, reconstitute the agricultural economy and infrastructure, and
provide  a  means  to  identify  the  bioterrorists  and  bring  them  to  justice.  The
NBAF will enhance situational awareness of the health of the American pop-
ulace, animals, plants, food supply, and environment, and result in better in-
formed  decision-making  and  a  quicker  federal,  State,  and  local  response  to
foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. The capabilities provided by the NBAF
meet  the  requirements  of  HSPD–9  and  HSPD–10.  The  National  Bio  and
Agrodefense  Facility  will  ensure  healthy  livestock  for  the  21st  century  and
protect the public.

• Low Volatility Agent Warning System [$20 million]

An  additional  $20  million  is  provided  to  develop  the  Low  Volatility  Agent
(LVA) Warning System, which will serve as the basis for a warning and iden-
tification capability against a set of chemical threat agents whose vapor pres-
sure  is  sufficiently  low  that  detection  by  conventional  approaches  is  excep-
tionally  difficult.  This  set  of  low  volatility  agents  includes  some  of  the  most
toxic  materials  currently  known.  The  Chemical  Countermeasures  portfolio
has  initiated  an  effort  to  develop  a  transportable  capability  for  the  detection
of  these  materials  in  a  response  and  recovery  mode.  This  R&D  effort  is  re-
ferred  to  as  LVA  Surface  Contamination  Monitor.  The  additional  FY  2006
funding  will  be  used  to  develop  a  protection-mode  capability  to  detect  these
materials  upon  release  in  specific  environments.  This  detect-to-warn  system
will  alert  the  response  system  of  the  imminent  hazard  and  enable  protection
of  potential  victims  from  exposure  and  permit  application  of  prompt  medical
countermeasures  to  minimize  or  eliminate  casualties.  This  system  will  be  a
network  of  detectors  to  provide  a  protect-to-warn  capability  for  specific
venues, such as high-value buildings and transit systems. The LVA Warning
System will both detect and identify the agent to ensure correct medical coun-
termeasures are engaged.

• Radiological/Nuclear  Countermeasures  Test  and  Evaluation  Complex

[$9 million]
The  Radiological/Nuclear  Countermeasures  Test  and  Evaluation  Complex
(Rad/NucCTEC),  part  of  the  DNDO,  will  provide  the  Nation  with  the  nec-
essary facilities and capabilities to validate the performance of systems under
development,  and  already  deployed,  to  protect  the  United  States  from  the
threat  of  a  terrorist  radiological  or  nuclear  attack.  Located  on  the  Nevada
Test Site, the Rad/NucCTEC will be a unique national asset, permitting clas-
sified  high-fidelity  testing  of  radiological/nuclear  sensors  and  sensor  systems
utilizing  strategic  quantities  of  special  nuclear  materials  in  realistic  configu-
rations.  The  Rad/NucCTEC  will  provide  the  Nation  with  the  capacity  to  rap-
idly  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  current  and  developing  homeland  de-
fenses  against  validated  threats,  using  actual  radiological  and  nuclear  mate-
rials, for which no facility currently exists.

• Counter–MAN  Portable  Air  Defense  Systems  (C–MANPADS)  [$49  mil-

lion]
C–MANPADS’ increase of $49 million plus $61 million of base funding equal
to  a  total  funding  level  of  $110  million  in  FY  2006.  If  deemed  appropriate
based  on  the  Phase  II  results  and  approval  from  Congress,  the  Counter–
MANPADS  Program  will  initiate  Phase  III  to  include  delivery  and  installa-
tion  of  pre-production  Counter–MANPADS  equipment  on  commercially  oper-
ated aircraft by U.S. cargo carriers similar to those aircraft dedicated to meet
the  Civil  Reserve  Air  Fleet  (CRAF)  requirement.  To  foster  competition,  the
additional funds will be used to maintain two contractors in Phase III. In FY

2006,  each  contractor  will  update  its  designs  to  incorporate  new  design  re-
quirements  including  reliability  improvements,  technology  protection,  and
emergency  ground  notification.  Operational  testing  and  evaluation  will  be
performed on multiple aircraft types to capture true operational and mainte-
nance costs as well as technical performance and reliability data. In FY 2006,
twenty  operational  aircraft  will  be  modified  and  sixteen  Counter–MANPADS
systems  will  be  procured  to  support  reliability  and  test  data  collection  and
critical technology protection measures. This information is critical to further
maturing the life cycle cost impact analysis to the airlines, and the extensive
reliability  analysis  will  be  used  to  validate  and  improve  system  reliability.
Dialogue with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), such as Boeing and
Airbus, will be initiated and studies conducted to scope the effort required to
include  provisions  for  Counter–MANPADS  systems  on  future  production  air-
craft. Additionally, live fire test evaluations will provide insight into the over-
all  effectiveness  of  the  system  installed  on  commercial  aircraft.  Finally,  Fed-
eral  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  certification  will  be  completed  for  addi-
tional relevant aircraft types/models/series not addressed in Phase II.

• Research and Development Consolidation [$127.5 million] (67 FTE)

The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA),  the  United  States  Coast
Guard (USCG), the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the
Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) will integrate their
RDT&E  activities  with  those  conducted  within  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security’s S&T Directorate. This consolidation will bring the scientific and en-
gineering  personnel  and  other  RDT&E  resources  of  the  Department  under  a
single  accountable  authority.  The  S&T  Directorate’s  vision  for  this  RDT&E
integration will be to start the development and expansion of collaborative re-
lationships,  foster  and  leverage  an  environment  of  collective  capabilities,
maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department’s RDT&E capac-
ity  as  well  as  develop  and  expand  synergistic  RDT&E  programs  that  cut
across  the  Department’s  activities.  Bringing  RDT&E  under  the  S&T  Direc-
torate  will  allow  the  other  organizational  elements  to  collaborate  in  the
RDT&E integration and to focus on their operational missions, and eliminate
within  them  the  specialized  management  infrastructure  required  to  manage
RDT&E.  The  FY  2006  R&D  Consolidation  budget  is  $127,497,000  of  which
$10,600,000 is in support of 67 FTEs and $116,897,000 is for RDT&E.

In  addition  to  the  RDT&E  activities  conducted  at  the  portfolio  level,  the  Science
and Technology Directorate is committed to additional activities that both facilitate
and enhance the research efforts of the portfolios. The Directorate places significant
emphasis  on  its  interfaces  with  other  government  agencies  as  well  as  the  transfer
of technology to other directorates and agencies.
Studies and Analysis

The  Homeland  Security  Science  and  Technology  Advisory  Committee  (HSSTAC)
and the Homeland Security Institute (HSI) constitute the major activities of Studies
& Analysis. Both were established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to pro-
vide  independent  scientific  &  technical  analytic  expertise  to  the  Department
through  the  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology.  HSSTAC  operates  under
the  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act.  HSI  operates  in  accordance  with  regulations
governing  Federally  Funded  Research  and  Development  Centers.  By  charter,  each
engages  in  substantial  contact  with  other  agencies,  private  sectors,  and  other  enti-
ties to facilitate communication, identify issues, and bring the best advice to the De-
partment and the Government.

Annual Report to Congress: The Committee’s overarching conclusions are:

• The  S&T  Directorate  has  made  notable  progress  in  organizing,  establishing
processes, establishing relationships with other Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS) activities and with the broader community relevant to homeland
security.
• The  Directorate’s  strategic  planning  process  is  underway  but  needs  staffing,
clear  intent  and  guidance,  metrics  useful  to  set  priorities,  and  methodologies
for planning and assessments.
• The  Directorate  has  become  the  default  operator  of  some  fielded  systems;  fo-
cusing  on  operating  fielded  systems  will  divert  both  attention  and  resources
needed to develop the needed new and improved capabilities.

Division of Effort Among the DHS S&T Directorate and Research Efforts at

Other Government Agencies

One of the accomplishments of which I am personally most proud is the emphasis
our  new  Directorate  has  put  on  interacting  with  other  federal  departments  and
agencies. Knowledge of other science and technology programs and their results, ap-
propriate collaboration between agencies, coordination of relevant programmatic ac-
tivities,  and  information  sharing  are  essential  for  us  to  best  meet  our  mission  re-
quirements.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  recognizes  that  many  organizations  are
contributing  to  the  science  and  technology  base  needed  to  enhance  the  Nation’s  ca-
pabilities  to  thwart  terrorist  acts  and  to  fully  support  the  conventional  missions  of
the operational components of the Department. Congress recognized the importance
of the research and development being conducted by numerous federal departments
and  agencies,  and,  in  the  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002,  directed  the  Under  Sec-
retary  for  Science  and  Technology  to  coordinate  the  Federal  Government’s  civilian
efforts to identify and develop countermeasures to current and emerging threats.

We take this responsibility very seriously.
Over  the  last  year,  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  has  worked  with  the
Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  the  Homeland  Security  Council,  the  Na-
tional Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the
Vice  President  to  initiate  the  effort  to  coordinate  homeland  security  research  and
development  across  the  entire  United  States  Government.  It  will  come  as  no  sur-
prise  to  the  members  of  this  Subcommittee  that  good,  solid,  effective  research  and
development  relevant  to  homeland  security  is  being  conducted  by  the  Departments
of  Agriculture,  Commerce,  Defense,  Energy,  Justice,  Health  and  Human  Services,
State,  and  Veteran’s  Affairs;  within  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  and  other  federal  agencies;  and  by  members  of  the  Intel-
ligence Community.

Several  interagency  working  groups  already  exist  that  are  addressing  issues  im-
portant  to  homeland  security.  The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  has  been,
and  continues  to  be,  an  active  participant  in  these  working  groups,  and  in  most
cases  has  taken  a  leadership  role.  These  fora  foster  an  active  exchange  of  informa-
tion  and  assist  each  participating  agency  in  identifying  related  needs  and  require-

ments, conducting research and development of mutual benefit, and avoiding dupli-
cation of effort.

We  also  continue  to  have  discussions  at  multiple  levels  of  management  with  fed-
eral departments and agencies, as well as with the Office of Management and Budg-
et, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Homeland Security Council.
These  discussions  ensure  that  the  strongest  possible  links  are  made  and  the  best
possible coordination occurs between our Department and those who are conducting
sector-specific research.

A full list of S&T Directorate interagency interactions and their results are listed

in the Appendix.
Technology Transfer

We  are  often  asked  about  the  transfer  of  technologies  between  Departments.  I
want  to  assure  you  that  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  is  very  concerned
about  technology  transfer.  Often,  technology  developed  for  one  purpose,  such  as  a
military  application,  cannot  be  transferred  in  a  straightforward  manner  to  civil  op-
erations.  The  requirements  for  maintenance  and  support,  for  performance,  and  for
total  cost  of  ownership  often  inhibit  such  transfers.  Although  the  basic  scientific
principles that underpin a particular technology may be leveraged, nevertheless sig-
nificant re-engineering is required to make the technology suitable for homeland se-
curity purposes.

Other  issues  associated  with  transferring  technologies  to  the  homeland  security
operating  environment  include  the  need  for  ease  of  operations,  extremely  low  total
cost  of  ownership,  providing  liability  relief,  providing  incentives  for  non-federal  ac-
tors  to  purchase  useful  technologies,  developing  and  promulgating  standards  and
providing  technical  assistance  to  aid  those  purchasers  in  their  procurement  deci-
sions.  While  the  Department  has  made  tremendous  progress  in  all  these  areas,
much remains to be done, and sustained effort is needed.
Short-Term and Long-Term Research

In  the  two  years  that  this  Department  has  been  in  existence,  the  Science  and
Technology Directorate has focused its efforts on near-term development and deploy-
ment of technologies to improve our nation’s ability to detect and respond to poten-
tial  terrorist  acts.  However,  we  recognize  that  a  sustained  effort  to  continually  add
to  our  knowledge  base  and  our  resource  base  is  necessary  for  future  developments.
Thus,  we  have  invested  a  portion  of  our  resources,  including  our  university  pro-
grams,  toward  these  objectives.  The  following  table  indicates  our  expenditures  in
basic research, applied research, and development to date.

Our  expenditures  in  basic  research  are  heavily  weighted  by  our  investments  in
university programs. These university programs will not only provide new informa-
tion  relevant  to  homeland  security,  but  will  also  provide  a  workforce  of  people  who
are cognizant of the needs of homeland security, especially in areas of risk analysis,
animal-related  agro-terrorism,  bioforensics,  cybersecurity,  disaster  modeling,  and
psychological and behavioral analysis.
Basis for Policy on the Use of the National Laboratories

The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  recognizes  the  unique  technical  expertise
and  infrastructure  at  the  Department  of  Energy  national  laboratories.  The  Science
and Technology Directorate has and will continue to maximize and leverage the ex-
isting  capability  base  at  the  national  laboratories  to  address  DHS  strategic  objec-
tives. The S&T Directorate will use strategic partner laboratories to assist in devel-

97

oping  program  direction,  and  we  will  make  strategic  investments  in  the  national
laboratories to build an enduring national capability for DHS. For example, the S&T
Directorate  is  creating  technical  centers  within  the  national  laboratories  where  ex-
pertise  currently  exists  in  specialized  areas,  such  as  a  visual  analytics  center  and
a biodefense knowledge center.

The  Directorate  submitted  a  Report  to  Congress  on  the  ‘‘Utilization  of  the  Na-
tional Laboratories’’ last October which describes the Science and Technology Direc-
torate’s policy regarding the use of the national laboratory resources. The report de-
tails  how  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  has  translated  its  performance-
based management philosophy into annual rigorous processes for program planning,
program  execution,  and  program  reviews.  Through  this  annual  cycle,  work  per-
formed  at  each  of  the  laboratories  is  peer  reviewed  and  funding  decisions  for  the
following year are based on the annual performance reviews.
Staffing

When the Department of Homeland Security stood up on March 1, 2003, the S&T
Directorate had a total staff of about 87, including the 53 staff transferred from the
Department of Energy’s Environmental Measurements Laboratory.

Two  years  later,  we  have  a  staff  of  nearly  450,  including  167  DHS  employees,
Nine Public Health Service Officers, 32 Intergovernmental Personnel Act employees,
17 individuals on assignment from other agencies, and 223 contractors.

We continue to be active in staffing our Directorate with well-qualified individuals
whose  skills  support  the  full  breadth  of  our  responsibilities  and  RDT&E  activities.
We continue to actively seek additional staff in accordance with our approved staff-
ing plan.
Conclusion

With  nearly  two  years  under  the  Department’s  belt,  the  scientists  and  engineers
in  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  have  accomplished  more  than  I  could
have expected. I am proud to have shared with you today some of those success sto-
ries. We have appended a more comprehensive summary of accomplishments to date
for the record.

We  also  recognize  that  there  is  much  to  do,  and  we  will  be  working  just  as  hard

in FY 2006.

I  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  the  Science  Committee,  my  colleagues
here  today,  other  federal  departments  and  agencies;  the  academic  community;  and
private  industry  to  continue  the  work  begun  and  continually  improve  our  ability  to
protect our homeland and way of life.

Accomplishments of the Science and Technology

Directorate

Department of Homeland Security

FY 2004 to February 2005

Biological Countermeasures

• Deployed additional environmental sensor systems to new metropolitan areas
to  protect  our  nation’s  cities  from  the  threat  and  ramifications  of  a  bioter-
rorist attack. BioWatch activities were significantly increased during the Na-
tional  Code  Orange  Alert  (December  2003–January  2004),  with  twice  daily
samplings  in  the  high  threat  cities,  additional  collectors  for  special  New
Year’s  events  and  Bowl  Games,  and  deployment  of  temporary  BioWatch  sys-
tems  to  non-BioWatch  cities  of  special  concern.  BioWatch  also  provided  field
and  laboratory  support  to  the  G8  Conference,  the  Democratic  National  Con-
vention,  and  the  Republican  National  Convention  in  Boston  and  New  York,
respectively.

• Continued  to  develop  new  technologies  to  support  biosurveillance  and  detec-
tion. Two detection R&D programs transferred to DHS from the DOE’s Chem-
ical and Biological National Security Program (CBNP) are reaching their suc-
cessful conclusion. The Autonomous Pathogen Detection System that provides
for totally automated integrated sample collection and analysis is now under-
going  field-testing  in  New  York  City,  while  the  hand-portable  chemical  and
biological  detection  system  known  as  micro-ChemLab  is  one  of  the  leading
contenders  for  the  next  generation  DOD  Joint  ChemBio  Modular  Detector.
High  throughput  processing  techniques  that  will  greatly  increase  BioWatch
capability  have  been  developed  and  are  being  piloted  as  part  of  the  second
generation  BioWatch  system  known  as  Gen  2  BioWatch.  This  pilot  is  in  the
process of being deployed in New York City and will involve a two-to-threefold
expansion  of  the  number  of  collectors  at  locations  to  be  specified  by  the  city
(e.g., high profiles venues, subways, transportation hubs) with an even great-
er increase in sample analysis capability so as to support surge activities and
the  extensive  follow-on  analysis  that  would  have  to  be  done  in  the  wake  of
an actual event. Efforts are underway in the BioNet program to develop inte-
grated concept of operations with civilian and military bio-monitoring systems
(e.g.,  BioWatch  and  the  Joint  Service  Installation  Pilot  Program  (JSIPP)/
Guardian)  using  San  Diego,  California,  as  the  pilot  site.  Solicitations  and
awards  for  next  generation  biological  detection  systems  to  support  a  fully
automated  BioWatch  (Gen  3)  and  to  enable  very  rapid  detection  (about  two
minutes) for protecting special events and selected facilities have been made.
However,  these  detection  systems  are  only  as  good  as  the  underlying  bio-
assays  which  recognize  the  agents  of  interest.  These  assays  are  designed  to
detect multiple features in an organism so as to produce very low false alarm
rates, less than one in a million.
• Initiated the design of National BioSurveillance Integration System (NBIS) as
part  of  an  interagency  process.  When  completed  in  the  first  quarter  of  FY
2005,  we  will  work  with  the  Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protec-
tion (IAIP) Directorate to implement this system.
• Developed  a  set  of  ChemBio  Defense  Guidelines  for  Airports  that  are  cur-
rently  out  for  review  at  five  major  airports  around  the  country  through  the
Protective  and  Response  Options  for  Airport  Counter  Terrorism  (ProACT).
This  program,  The  Airport  Restoration  Demonstration,  at  the  San  Francisco
International  Airport  (SFO),  is  working  with  EPA,  CDC  and  SFO  to  develop
a  set  of  pre-approved  protocols  and  decontamination  agents  for  decontamina-
tion  and  return  to  service  of  major  airport  facilities.  As  part  of  this,  the  Na-
tional Academy of Sciences is conducting a study of ‘‘How clean is clean?’’ the
final  report  will  be  completed  in  the  spring  2005.  Work  is  on-going  on  im-
provements  to  technologies  for  facility  clean-up,  including  improvements  in
chlorine dioxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide approaches and the comple-
tion  and  testing  of  a  truck-deployed  chlorine  dioxide  based  decontamination
system.

• Using  the  reference  scenario  approach  recommended  by  HSPD–10  for  under-
standing  the  requirements  of  an  integrated  national  biodefense  architecture,
the  portfolio  will  complete  the  high-level  analyses  of  four  baseline  references
cases: a large outdoor release of a non-contagious agent (anthrax); a large in-
door  release  of  a  contagious  agent  (smallpox);  contamination  of  a  bulk  food
supply;  and  two  highly  virulent  agricultural  attacks,  one  on  livestock  (Foot
and  Mouth  Disease)  and  the  other  on  plants  (soy  bean  rust).  Completion  of
the architectures will identify key requirements for each major element, a ‘‘re-
port  card’’  on  the  current  and  projected  status  in  that  area  and  performing
detailed design tradeoffs for those areas in which DHS has execution respon-
sibility.
• Two material threat determinations have been made (anthrax and botulinum)
in support of BioShield and risk assessments have been performed to help un-
derstand  the  plausible  worse  case  scenarios  and  help  guide  the  size  of  the
BioShield procurements.
• BASIS  was  used  to  provide  additional  support  for  the  designated  National
Special Security Events (NSSEs) to include the 2004 G–8 Conference, and the
Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
• A  National  Strain  Repository  will  be  established  to  allow  comparison  of  sus-
pect  samples  with  known  existing  strains.  Genotyping  assays  will  be  com-
pleted for anthrax and be well underway for the next two high priority agents
determined by NBFAC and the law enforcement community.
• Initiating  operations  in  interim  facilities  until  completion  of  construction  of
the new NBACC facility currently scheduled for FY 2008/2009. Arrangements
have  been  made  for  use  of  BSL–2/3  aerosol  laboratory  capabilities  through
partnerships  and  agreements  with  Lovelace  Respiratory  Research  Institute,
Battelle Memorial Institute and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious  Diseases  (USAMRIID)  and  for  use  of  BSL–2/3/4  with  DOD,  USDA
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and CDC.
• A systematic biothreat risk analysis process has been initiated with broad in-
volvement from government, industry and universities. Technical support has
also been provided to the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate
of  DHS  and  to  the  CDC  to  assist  in  understanding  the  requirements  on  the
Strategic National Stockpile.
• HSPD–10  designates  the  National  Bioforensics  Analysis  Center  (NBFAC)  as
the  lead  national  facility  for  technical  analysis  of  forensic  samples  from  bio-
logical events. Pending completion of the NBACC construction, a 3,000 square
foot  dedicated  microbial  forensics 
laboratory  has  been  established  at
USAMRIID and is currently handling some 1500 samples. A joint governance
model  is  being  developed  with  the  FBI  and  others  and  a  broad  based  inter-
agency meeting was held to identify R&D requirements.
• Successfully addressing operational issues at the Plum Island Animal Disease
Center (PIADC). Improved security procedures have been implemented and a
new  Operations  and  Maintenance  Contractor  is  in  place.  An  integrated
USDA–DHS  research  strategy,  and  development,  including  a  detailed  veteri-
nary  countermeasures  and  diagnostics  strategy,  has  been  developed.  R&D
programs  have  been  initiated  to  evaluate  improved  variants  of  commercial
animal  vaccines,  develop  and  deploy  the  next  generation  multiplexed
diagnostics  assays  to  rapidly  and  unequivocally  identify  foreign  animal  dis-
eases  (FAD)  such  as  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  (FMD),  and  to  implement  a
bioforensics capability for FADs.

Chemical Countermeasures

• Initiated  a  process  to  define  the  requirements  and  process  for  a  robust  na-
tional  environmental  analytical  laboratory  capability  through  a  core  inter-
agency  working  group  including  EPA,  CDC,  and  other  stakeholders  under
DHS  Chemical  Countermeasures  leadership.  The  design  of  triage  laboratory
capability  to  support  analyses  of  complete  unknowns  was  completed.  The
portfolio conducted preliminary activities toward the development of a Chem-
ical  Security  Analysis  Center  (CSAC)  that  will  provide  threat  awareness  and
assessment.  An  overall  structure,  similar  to  that  characterizing  the  NBACC
and its supporting threat characterization, forensics, knowledge management
and reachback, is envisioned. Interfaces with the FBI and Scientific Working
Group  for  Forensic  Analysis  of  Chemical  Terrorism  (SWGFACT)  identified
shortfalls  in  current  forensics  capabilities  and  infrastructures  and  facilitated

100

the  initiation  of  a  comprehensive  program  to  address  technical  deficiencies.
Baseline forensics signatures were established, and an initial set of laboratory
forensics protocols were developed.
• Initiated  prototype  development  for  a  Mobile,  High-Throughput  Lab  ID  Sys-
tem.  This  system  is  a  self-contained  mobile  laboratory  for  on-site  chemical
analysis  of  a  high  volume  of  samples  to  support  comprehensive  assessment
of a chemical incident scene and to monitor progress of restoration activities.
There is no current capability for on-scene assessment and screening of envi-
ronmental  samples  to  streamline  the  process  of  remediating  a  contaminated
site.  As  has  been  demonstrated  by  previous  cases  of  chemical  contamination
of the environment, very large numbers of samples must be analyzed to deter-
mine  extent  of  contamination  and  then  support  decisions  to  re-use  after  de-
contamination  procedures.  Accordingly  a  high-throughput  (possibly  1000  per
day)  sample  stream  must  be  supported.  Design  the  concept  and  demonstrate
the prototype in 2005.
• Development of a playbook containing restoration protocols following a chem-
ical incident was initiated. Studies were initiated to develop and evaluate de-
contamination technologies for non-traditional agents.
• Deployed  a  chemical  threat  detection  system  to  Boston  and  New  York  City
transit stations for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, re-
spectively.  The  system  will  also  be  deployed  for  the  2005  Presidential  Inau-
guration.  The  system  was  based  on  the  Program  for  Response  Options  and
Technology  Enhancements  for  Chemical/Biological  Terrorism  (PROTECT)
chemical  agent  detection  system  recently  transitioned  to  the  Washington,
D.C.,  Washington  Metropolitan  Area  Transit  Authority  (WMATA)  metro  sys-
tem,  which  has  operated  for  a  year  without  a  false  alarm.  The  system  pro-
vides prompt detection of a chemical attack to effect optimal response actions.
The system deployed to New York City is being left in place as an initial per-
manent capability.
• Initiated  systems  studies  around  three  defining  scenarios:  indoor  chemical
agent  release,  outdoor  toxic  industrial  chemical  release,  and  release  of  toxin
in the water system. Primary components of these defining architectures were
developed  and  serve  as  the  basis  for  continued  definition  of  capability  gaps
and  required  improved  countermeasures.  Development  of  these  architectures
and  resultant  guiding  principles  will  be  coordinated  with  DHS  IAIP  as  well
as other government agencies to maximize cross-agency leverage. Three dem-
onstration  projects  were  also  initiated:  The  Facility  Restoration  Demonstra-
tion Project will develop and demonstrate a capability to restore a facility that
has been contaminated with a classical chemical agent or persistent toxic in-
dustrial  chemical  (TIC).  A  Water  Security  Demonstration  will  identify  and
characterize  technologies  with  the  potential  to  provide  warning  of  chemical
contamination  of  the  water  system.  A  NSSE  Deployable  Detection  System
Demonstration  will  develop  a  flexible  architecture  chemical  detection  system
that  can  be  utilized  for  the  warning  and  situational  awareness  of  chemical
threats in temporary deployments.
• Initiated  key  development  programs  targeting  leap-ahead  advancements  in
detection.  These  programs  will  develop  two  principal  capabilities:  a  facility
monitoring  detector  and  a  responder  detection  tool.  In  both  cases,  the  detec-
tors  will  provide  detection  and  discrimination  of  up  to  20  different  chemical
threats,  including  classical  chemical  warfare  agents  (CWAs)  and  toxic  indus-
trial  chemicals  (TICs)  in  a  single  unit  across  a  wide  range  of  concentrations.
Current chemical detectors address far fewer chemical agents. These new de-
tectors  will  be  network-compatible  to  provide  comprehensive  situational
awareness  and,  in  facilities,  will  initiate  response  actions  to  mitigate  the
threat as appropriate. A workshop was conducted to gather and discuss tech-
nology solutions for the challenge of detecting very low vapor pressure chem-
ical hazards. A program to develop such technologies was formulated.

Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures

• Presently developing new capabilities and a corresponding architecture for de-
tection of nuclear materials through a new coordinating office, which will out-
line  an  investment  strategy  for  nuclear  material  detection  R&D  as  well  as
procurement and deployment of next-generation technologies.
• Expanded secondary-reachback to include all instrumented Customs and Bor-
der  Protection’s  POEs  and  personnel,  and  U.S.  Coast  Guard  special  teams:
Expert  reachback  required  to  resolve  highly  suspicious  or  highly  anomalous

alarms  will  be  expanded  to  cover  all  sites  and  personnel  within  the  Bureau
of  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  and  USCG  that  use/carry  radiation
detection equipment.
• Radiological  and  Nuclear  Countermeasures  Test  and  Evaluation  Complex:
Provides capability to conduct controlled field testing of special nuclear mate-
rial (SNM) in their most relevant configuration in mock essential operational
venues. Initial capabilities will come on-line at the end of 2005.
• Assumed management of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ra-
diation  detection  test  bed  from  the  Department  of  Energy  in  August,  2003.
Following  the  transfer,  the  portfolio  broadened  the  project  scope  beyond  test-
ing and evaluating individual pieces of technology to a systems approach, in-
cluding  response  protocols  and  operational  concepts.  This  program  has  been
renamed  the  Countermeasures  Test  Bed  to  more  accurately  reflect  the  span
of the project.
• The  portfolio  will  initiate  a  joint  DHS/HSARPA  and  DOD/DARPA  (Depart-
ment of Defense/Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) project focusing
on radiological and nuclear decontamination, consisting of four main tasks: (1)
Radionuclide  capture  decontamination;  (2)  Wide  area  radionuclide  decon-
tamination; (3) Verification; and (4) Modeling.
• Further  efforts  will  begin  under  the  Environmental  Measurements  Lab’s
(EML) Urban Dispersion Program (UDP), an atmospheric dispersion modeling
effort to model the release of airborne hazardous materials in New York City.
Initial  work  on  this  project  will  begin  with  radiological  and  meteorological
network  installation  plans  as  well  as  survey  measurements  of  SF6  (tracer)
background  in  the  city  being  completed  this  year.  Additionally,  a  crisis  re-
sponse  scenario  analysis  was  conducted  to  identify  technologies  and  capabili-
ties  needed  for  crisis  response.  EML  is  also  currently  running  the  Incident
Management  Radiological  Monitoring  Network  in  New  York  City,  an  oper-
ational test bed for radiation sensor systems that can be used for search and
characterization  by  local  first  responders.  In  August  2004,  additional  sensor
nodes  were  installed  and  established  throughout  the  city,  at  sites  selected  in
conjunction  with  New  York’s  Office  of  Emergency  Management  (NYCOEM).
• Needs and technical approach analyses for both passive and active interroga-
tion  detection  technologies.  Several  advanced  passive  detector  technologies
are  in  the  early  stages  of  development:  an  inexpensive,  deployable,  high  effi-
ciency  neutron  sensor;  a  large  area  combined  neutron/gamma  detector;  a
large-volume  high-pressure  xenon  (HPXe)  detector;  a  directional  detector  for
fast neutrons; and a mercuric iodide (HgI2) detector. The large-volume HPXe
detector  is  currently  in  the  prototype  phase.  Also  in  development  are  two
gamma-ray  imaging  systems,  one  based  on  Compton  imaging  and  the  other
on  coded  aperture  imaging;  both  are  currently  in  early  prototyping  phases.
Additional  efforts  focused  on  the  detection  of  shielded  SNM  in  cargo  con-
tainers,  based  on  the  detection  of  both  neutrons  and  delayed  high-energy  fis-
sion  product  gamma  rays,  and  a  portable  neutron  source,  based  on  a  mixed
alpha-Be  source  in  a  switchable  configuration  for  use  in  active  interrogation;
both currently are still in conceptual design and experiment phases.
• Improvements in two current Customs and Border Protection-deployed radio-
graphic  imaging  systems.  This  included  software  improvements  and  systems
upgrades  for  local  data  integration,  threat  image  projection  (TIP),  and  as-
sisted  imaging  processing  (AIP).  Efforts  are  expected  to  begin  in  the  4th
Quarter of FY 2004 for work on near-term improvements in hand-held radio-
isotope  identification  (RIID),  area  search  devices  with  radioisotope  identifica-
tion,  passive  primary  portals,  advanced  radiography  systems  for  cargo  and
parcels, and advanced active imaging and screening systems.
• An additional effort is directed towards a comprehensive chemical, biological,
• Further  efforts  were  begun  under  the  Environmental  Measurements  Lab’s
(EML) Urban Dispersion Program (UDP), an atmospheric dispersion modeling
effort to model the release of airborne hazardous materials in New York City.
Initial  work  on  this  project  has  begun,  with  radiological  and  meteorological
network  installation  plans  as  well  as  survey  measurements  of  SF6  (tracer)
background  in  the  city  being  completed  this  year.  Additionally,  a  crisis  re-
sponse  scenario  analysis  was  conducted  to  identify  technologies  and  capabili-
ties  needed  for  crisis  response.  EML  is  also  currently  running  the  Incident
Management  Radiological  Monitoring  Network  in  New  York  City,  an  oper-
ational test bed for radiation sensor systems that can be used for search and

radiological and nuclear (CBRN) water system vulnerability study.

characterization  by  local  first  responders.  By  August  2004,  additional  sensor
nodes  will  have  been  installed  and  established  throughout  the  city,  at  sites
selected  in  conjunction  with  New  York’s  Office  of  Emergency  Management
(NYCOEM).

Explosives Countermeasures

• Initiated the development of a prototype explosive detector for vehicle bombs,
and  accelerated  the  development  of  hardened  overhead  storage  bins  for  pas-
senger  aircraft.  Additionally,  it  initiated  a  survey  and  evaluation  of  commer-
cial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)  equipment  to  detect,  interdict  and  mitigate  the  con-
sequences of suicide bombers and vehicle bombs, and conducted a cost-benefit
analysis of approaches to aircraft hardening.

Threat and Vulnerability Testing and Assessment

• Delivered  two  operational  components,  the  Threat  Vulnerability  Integration
System  (TVIS)  and  the  Threat-Vulnerability  Mapper  (TVM),  to  the  IAIP  Di-
rectorate.  The  TVM  provides  counterterrorism  analysts  with  a  simple,
straightforward way to depict the geographic distribution of threats across the
U.S.  and  to  search  the  underlying  databases  for  information  on  the  possible
actors,  agents,  potential  severity  of  attacks,  and  extent  of  the  vulnerabilities
to and effects of such attacks. TVIS integrates high-volume information anal-
ysis  capabilities  with  specialized  visualization  tools  that  enable  analysts  to
process large amounts of disparate intelligence data.
• Created  the  Interagency  Center  for  Applied  Homeland  Security  Technology
(ICAHST)  capable  of  addressing  the  technical  needs  of  the  Department  and
other  members  of  the  Homeland  Security  community.  The  center  and  its
interconnected laboratories provides detailed technical information and guides
research, strategy, and systems design for the broad range of technologies and
techniques necessary to identify, understand, and remediate CBRNE threats.
The  center  consolidates  and  validates  the  S&T  Directorate’s  and  other  cus-
tomers’  technical  requirements  as  well  as  performs  comprehensive  technical
evaluations of technologies either available through commercial, academic, or
government sectors or being specifically developed through the various TVTA
research  programs.  The  ICAHST  activity  is  supported  by  an  interagency
Steering  Group  with  representatives  from  23  intelligence  and  law  enforce-
ment agencies.
• Completed an initial set of 120 all-CBRNE capability assessments for 20 ter-
rorist  organizations  on  the  five  CBRNE  plus  cyber  threat  agents.  Continued
support to the Nuclear Assessment Program (NAP) that judges the credibility
of  communicated  nuclear  threats  for  such  clients  as  the  FBI,  DOE,  and  De-
partment of State (DOS).
• Created the National Visualization and Analytics Center (NVAC). NVAC cre-
ates  a  national  agenda  document  for  visual  analytics  with  broad  input  and
support from the government, national laboratories and universities and pro-
vides  the  following  four  core  functions:  research  and  development,  education,
technology  evaluation  and  implementation,  integration  and  coordination.
NVAC is expected to address the intrinsic challenges of:

• Establish  an  integrated,  national  capability,  called  the  Institute  for  Discrete
Sciences  (IDS),  to  investigate  and  develop  the  specialized  computing  algo-
rithms  and  hardware  architectures  necessary  to  analyze  massive  amounts  of
diverse  data  from  multiple,  disparate,  distributed  data  sources,  and  to  model
terrorist  attacks  and  simulate  consequences  on  a  real-time,  high-resolution
basis.  Like  the  NVAC,  the  IDS  will  have  broad  interaction  and  support  from
the government, national laboratories and universities.

• Dealing  with  massive  streams  of  information  in  support  of  the  analysts;
• Visualization  of  information  for  detecting  deception  and  resolving  uncer-
• Visualization  of  temporal  primary  and  supportive  theme  relationships
• New,  multi-dimensional  visualization  tools  for  human-information  dis-
course,  which  enable  analysts  to  query,  cluster  or  group,  and  manage
multiple  types  (for  example,  databases  or  unstructured  text)  and  modes
(such  as  text,  audio,  video,  imagery,  or  sensor)  of  data  or  information  as
well as incomplete data streams.

• Complete an engineering design for the Enhanced International Travel Secu-
rity  (EITS)  system,  initiated  in  FY  2004,  which  will  enable  several  pilots  to
be  implemented  with  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada,  and  Australia.  EITS  al-
lows the validity of travel documents and the identity of travelers to be deter-
mined in real-time at U.S. borders and other points of entry.
• Provide  the  science  and  technology  needed  in  the  development  of  biometrics
for  precise  identification  of  individuals,  and  develop  prototype  instrumenta-
tion to aid authorized officials in detecting individuals with potentially hostile
intent.
• Enable  a  comprehensive  capability  for  determining  terrorist  motivations,
based  on  social,  behavioral,  and  economic  factors.  Integrate  this  with  tech-
niques  for  determining  terrorist  or  hostile  intent  as  well  as  detecting  decep-
tion.

Standards

responding to the EP&R mission.

• Continued  development  of  the  First  Responder  Chemical,  Biological,  Radio-
logical,  Nuclear  and  Explosives  (CBRNE)  Protective  and  Operational  Equip-
ment Standards Development Program, an ongoing comprehensive, multi-year
program  that  is  developing  an  integrated  suite  of  national  standards  for
emergency responder CBRNE protective and operational equipment.
• Developed  standards  that  address  radiation  protection  for  all  activities  cor-
• Developed  comprehensive  standards  for  the  development,  testing,  and  certifi-
cation of effective detection, response, remediation, and forensics tools for ra-
diological and nuclear materials.
• Composed three management directives to establish DHS policy with regards
to  the  adoption  and  development  of  national  standards.  Two  of  the  manage-
ment  directives  dealing  with  DHS  internal  standards  policies  have  been
issued. In addition to establishing policy, the standards program has engaged
with  the  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)  to  develop  a  search-
able database containing existing standards related to homeland security and
to establish the ANSI Homeland Security Standards Panel.
• Formed  an  interagency  task  force  to  address  the  controversy  over  the  effec-
tiveness  and  use  of  lateral  flow  immunoassays  for  the  detection  of  Bacillus
anthracis  (anthrax)  by  emergency  responders.  Five  commercially  available
hand-held  immunoassays  and  two  reference  methods  have  been  tested  and
evaluated in a multiple laboratory study. Other accomplishments in biological
countermeasures include an effort with Edgewood Chemical Biological Center
(ECBC)  to  evaluate  a  five  step  method  to  pre-screen  suspicious  white  pow-
ders,  an  effort  with  NIST  to  look  at  the  effectiveness  of  biological  agent
simulants, and the establishment of a program to address both chemical and
biological  decontamination  standards  for  the  first  responder  community.  A
draft standard for a hand-held vaporous chemical warfare agent detector was
developed. A project was initiated to provide both physical standards and vali-
dated  spectral  libraries  necessary  to  impart  confidence  in  the  performance  of
portable  Raman  spectrophotometers  (currently  in  use  by  first  responders  to
identify  unknown  substances  in  real-time  with  minimal  handling).  Other  ac-
complishments  include  participation  in  the  development  of  Protective  Action
Guides following a RDD/IND event; the development and adoption of the first
radiological and nuclear detector for four classes of radiation detection equip-
ment ranging from hand-held alarming detectors to radiation portal monitors
for  cargo  containers;  the  development  and  evaluation  of  the  four  accom-
panying test and evaluation protocols; testing of relevant COTS radiation de-
tection  equipment;  production  of  standardized  test  sources  (γ-ray,  neutron);
and the initiation of an effort to develop performance specifications for active
interrogation  systems  (x-ray,  gamma-ray,  and  neutron  imaging)  used  in  the
detection of SNMs. High explosive countermeasures initiatives include stand-
ards  for  explosives  reference  materials,  trace  explosive  detection  devices,  and
explosive mitigation equipment standards. The high explosives standards pro-
gram  is  leveraging  programs  funded  by  the  Department  of  Justice’s  National
Institute  of  Justice  to  develop  performance  metrics  for  bomb  disposal  robots,
and to develop a bomb suit standard. Cyber Security programs were initiated
to address E-Authentication (for remote authentication techniques), Forensics
for Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)/Handheld Devices, and Checklists for Se-
curing  Operating  Systems  and  Application  Configurations.  Specific  accom-
plishments  include  an  exploratory  workshop  on  knowledge  based  authentica-

ment  on  PDA  forensic  policies,  guidance  document  on  current  forensic  soft-
ware  for  PDAs,  draft  guideline  for  the  overall  Security  Configuration  Check-
lists  Program,  and  a  draft  Special  Publication  800–68  Guide  for  Securing
Microsoft  Windows  XP  Systems  for  IT  Professionals.  A  list  of  prioritized  re-
quirements for CBRNE countermeasures standards will be constructed based
upon  the  interagency  working  group’s  efforts.  In  addition,  a  report  and  data-
base  on  existing  CBRNE  countermeasures  standards  will  be  issued.  New
standard  development  will  focus  on  validation  of  existing,  high  priority,  high
use technology for CBRNE detection Polymeric Chain Reaction (PCR) devices,
Raman  spectrophotometers,  spectroscopy  based  portal  monitors,  neutron  de-
tectors,  high  energy  x-ray  interrogation  systems,  neutron  interrogation  sys-
tems,  trace  explosive  detection  devices,  and  explosion  mitigation  devices).  In
addition,  work  on  characterizing  the  performance  of  candidate  CBRNE
simulant and reference materials will expand. Efforts will be expanded in the
area  of  CBRNE  decontamination  standards.  Efforts  will  be  initiated  to  de-
velop  COTS  and  Government-off-the-shelf  (GOTS)  CBRNE  equipment  con-
sumer report guides based on FY 2004 testing results. To address Cyber secu-
rity  standards  the  programs  for  E–Authentication,  Forensics  for  PDA/
Handheld Devices and Checklists for Securing Operating Systems and Appli-
cation  Configurations  will  be  continued,  along  with  a  new  start  to  develop  a
Standardized Mechanism for Universal Access Control to enable and promote
sharing of information across organizational boundaries each with potentially
different  access  control  policies.  The  standard  access  control  mechanism  pro-
gram will survey existing access control policies and models identify and doc-
ument access controls most primitive and atomic principles and functions and
design  a  universal  access  control  mechanism  capable  of  abstracting,  com-
bining and enforcing all existing attribute based access control policies.
• A  standard  for  full  frontal  facial  photographs  entitled  ‘‘Face  Recognition  For-
mat  for  Data  Interchange’’  developed  by  the  International  Committee  for  In-
formation Technology Standards (INCITS) is currently in the process of being
formally adopted by DHS. A biometrics working group was established to gain
consensus  on  the  adoption  of  the  standard.  A  contract  is  being  negotiated
with INCITS that will give access to the standard to DHS employees and con-
tractors via the DHS website. Supported a program to develop a portable, ex-
ternally  deployable,  biometric  acquisition  and  information  system,  designed
specifically for collecting data for evaluation.
• Continue work with ASTM International to obtain final approval for the Hos-
pital  Preparedness  Standards  and  the  METL  standard  for  first  responders.
New  initiatives  with  ASTM  on  homeland  security  standards  will  include  a
standard guide for building event dispersion and health assessment prepared-
ness  and  response  planning,  a  standard  guide  for  conducting  emergency  pre-
paredness  drills  and  exercises,  and  a  standard  guide  for  developing  model
emergency  operations  plans  in  response  to  all-hazard  events  including
CBRNE.  DHS  will  support  EML  to  initiate  a  cooperative  interagency  effort
to address laboratory emergency response measurement protocol development
and  laboratory  capability  and  capacity  assessment.  Work  with  National  Inci-
dent  Management  System  (NIMS)  Integration  Center  (NIC)  and  Urban
Search and Rescue (USAR) robotics standards will continue.
• Supported efforts with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to
coordinate the development of a draft standard for hospital preparedness and
to  develop  a  multi-disciplinary  Mission  Essential  Task  List  (METL)  based  on
Emergency  Responder  Guidelines  developed  by  the  Office  of  Domestic  Pre-
paredness.  Supported  the  EML  along  with  the  Council  of  Ionizing  Radiation
Measurements and Standards (CIRMS) to organize several sessions to gather
information  on  standard  operating  procedures  and  method  standards  that
would  be  used  in  data  collection,  sample  preparation  and  analysis,  data  re-
duction,  as  well  as  data  reporting.  To  address  requirements  outlined  in  the
National  Incident  Management  System  (NIMS),  S&T  Directorate  is  sup-
porting an effort to catalog existing incident management standards and iden-
tify  and  address  gaps.  Initiated  an  effort  with  the  NIST  to  develop  com-
prehensive  standards  related  to  the  development,  testing,  and  certification  of
effective  technologies  for  sensing,  mobility,  navigation,  planning,  integration,
and operator interaction within urban search and rescue robotic systems.

open-circuit  Self-Contained  Breathing  Apparatus  (SCBA),  CBRN  Full  Face-
piece Air Purifying Respirator (APR), CBRN Air-Purifying Escape Respirator,
CBRN  Self-Contained  Escape  Respirator.  To  date,  50  separate  models  from
six  major  manufacturers  of  SCBA  have  been  certified,  and  two  models  of
APRs have been certified.
• Established ties with the training community including the Center for Domes-
tic Preparedness and local and State organizations. The S&T Directorate has
also  reached  out  to  determine  the  necessary  requirements  and  needs  for
training standards by participating and supporting the ANSI’s Homeland Se-
curity Standards Panel Subcommittee on Training. Currently establishing the
process  by  which  training  standards  requirements  will  be  compiled  and
prioritized.  In  addition,  the  development  of  standards  to  address  training  to
current DHS adopted radiation detector standards is in progress.
• Initiated efforts to supplement those supported by the Wireless Public SAFE-
ty  Inter-operable  COMmucations  (SAFECOM)  program.  Initiated  an  effort
with  NIST  to  define  wireless  communications  requirements  and  approaches
for urban environments, to develop emergency response operations equipment
standards  dealing  with  tactical  information  from  building  sensors  and  sys-
tems, wide-band characterization of the dielectric properties of building mate-
rials, the definition of wireless ad hoc and personal area networks public safe-
ty  requirements,  and  the  development  of  an  overall  security  model  for  infor-
mation  sharing.  These  efforts  support  the  integration  of  communications
equipment with protective equipment used during incident response.
• Established the Geospatial Working Group Subcommittee on Standards (with
the  support  of  the  DHS  Geospatial  Management  Office)  to  address  the  adop-
tion  of  a  suite  of  Geospatial  related  standards.  Work  will  continue  under  the
auspices  of  the  Geospatial  Working  Group  Subcommittee  on  Standards.  The
group will review the compilation of standards recommended for adoption and
achieve consensus on the adoption of all relevant Geospatial standards.
• Supported an effort at NIST to work with the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers  (ASME)  to  prepare  for  acceptance  a  suite  of  standards  and  mate-
rials  for  a  training  course  on  how  to  apply  the  homeland  security  standards
to  aid  the  owners  and  managers  of  constructed  facilities  in  the  selection  of
cost-effective strategies for the management of risks associated with terrorist
and natural hazards.
• Established  the  framework  for  a  DHS  conformity  assessment  working  group,
consisting of experts from DHS, other federal agencies, and the private sector.
Other accomplishments include a draft certification program for radiation de-
tectors  affected  by  the  DHS  adopted  ANSI  N42  Radiation  Detection  Stand-
ards;  the  development  and  deployment  of  a  conformity  assessment  training
module; outreach to the private sector through the ANSI’s Homeland Security
Standards Panel and the American Council of Independent Laboratories; and

tation  resources  that  have  the  competence  and  capacity  to  perform  selected
functions.

Emergency Preparedness and Response

• The  Interagency  Modeling  and  Atmospheric  Assessment  Center  (IMAAC)  is
a DHS-led capability that provides a single hazards prediction for airborne re-
lease of hazardous material. The IMAAC coordinates federal atmospheric sup-
port  for  ‘‘incidents  of  national  significance’’  and  provides  hazards  predictions
to  federal,  State  and  local  responders.  The  IMAAC  began  operation  in  FY
2004,  supporting  the  National  Exercise  Program  and  special  events,  such  as
the  Democratic  and  Republican  National  Conventions.  IMAAC  has  estab-
lished  near-real  time  connectivity  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security
Operations Center and the FEMA National Emergency Operations Center.
• Selected four urban areas were selected for the pilot Regional Technology In-
tegration  (RTI)  initiative.  These  locations  provide  an  opportunity  to  evaluate
geographic  and  governance  diversity  as  well  as  variability  in  threats  and
vulnerabilities.  An  integrated  assessment  process  has  been  initiated  in  col-
laboration  with  these  communities.  These  assessments  will  identify  key  as-
sets,  review  existing  vulnerability  and  threat  assessments,  emergency  pre-
paredness  and  response  plans  with  the  express  purpose  of  identifying  poten-
tial technology systems that can help prevent, detect, respond to and recover
from terrorist and other major emergencies.

• Leveraged the work initiated by ODP and the Memorial Institute for the Pre-
vention  of  Terrorism,  the  National  Institute  of  Justice  and  the  Department
of Defense in identifying needs and gaps as well as existing technology devel-
opment  programs  that  can  be  utilized  for  incident  management  training.  De-
veloping  a  rapid  prototype  of  the  Technology  Clearinghouse  ‘‘hub  and  spoke’’
concept to enable first responders to access important information on existing
and emerging technologies, training, and relevant standards through a single
knowledge portal.
• Established an R&D program that seeks materials and technologies that can
be  used  in  multi-hazard  environments,  applicable  to  diverse  users,  and  func-
tion  as  an  integral  part  of  a  more  complex  personal  protection  system.  Focus
is on materials that are lighter-weight or likely to impact on weight reduction
of  the  overall  personal  protective  system,  that  are  robust  and  able  to  with-
stand  the  challenges  of  strenuous  activity  in  unstable  and  uncertain  condi-
tions  (rubble,  collapsing  structures,  flying  debris,  etc.)  and  environments  (ex-
treme  heat  or  cold,  wind,  rain,  flash  fire)  and  provide  protection  against  a
multitude  of  hazards  (industrial  chemicals,  chemical  or  biological  warfare
agents, radiation, shrapnel, flying debris, other).
• Unified  Incident  Command  and  Decision  Support:  The  research  and  develop-
ment program in UICDS seeks to harness innovative ideas in an effort to cre-
ate  an  information  management  and  sharing  architecture  specifically  de-
signed  to  meet  the  needs  of  incident  commanders  and  emergency  responders
throughout  the  Nation.  It  further  seeks  to  realize  a  robust,  fully  functional
UICDS  information  management  system  to  enhance  the  safety  and  effective-
ness of the Nation’s emergency responder community. This program will con-
front  the  technical  challenges  associated  with  the  development  of  innovative,
modular,  scaleable,  and  secure  information  management  architecture.  Uti-
lizing  this  systems  approach  will  enable  incident  commanders  to  capture  im-
portant  incident-related  information,  analyze  captured  information,  more  ef-
fectively  disseminate  mission  critical  information  to  emergency  responders,
present  decision  guidance  options  for  incident  commanders,  more  finely  co-
ordinate  the  efforts  of  emergency  responders,  and  store  relevant  information
for future study.

Border and Transportation Security

• Issued  a  solicitation  for  an  Advanced  Container  Security  Device  to  develop
and  field-test  the  next  generation  of  shipping  container  security  devices,
building  on  the  current  efforts  through  Operation  Safe  Commerce  as  well  as
current  BTS  policy  efforts  to  develop  and  implement  performance  standards
for  container  security.  The  Advanced  Container  Security  Device  Program  is
part  of  a  ‘‘Future  Smart  Container’’  initiative  encompassing  container  secu-
rity, communications, and data systems for the future. The goal is to develop
and  field-test  the  next-generation  of  shipping  container  security  devices  that
are not currently available in the marketplace.
• Supported BTS in putting technology in the field to support the Arizona Bor-
der Control Initiative. The program funded the effort to put Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles into operation to support surveillance activities. Demonstrated other
technologies such as a long range acoustic device which allows agents to com-
municate  from  a  safer  stand-off  distance  to  determine  the  intent  of  people.
These  opportunities  allowed  the  BTS  portfolio  to  evaluate  new  technologies
that  could  improve  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  our  border  patrol  agents.
• Conducted  a  series  of  officer  and  agent  workshops  to  understand  the  oper-
ational environments, functional capabilities needed, and associated goals. In
addition,  a  series  of  technologist  workshops  were  conducted  with  federal,  in-
dustry  and  academia  experts  to  examine  the  technologies  needed  to  fill  the
gaps  in  capabilities  identified  during  the  operators’  workshops.  Because  not
all gaps can or will be solved by technology, those gaps that do not lend them-
selves  to  technological  solutions  were  referred  to  BTS  management  for  their
information  and  attention.  Added  a  Scenario  Game  feature  to  some  of  the
workshops.  The  purpose  of  these  scenario-based  seminar  games  was  to  high-
light and validate areas for investment and high pay-off, focus on national im-
pact  of  technology  decisions,  examine  requirements  across  components,  and
analyze  the  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities  and  threats  of  current  pro-
cedures and technologies.
• Developed  a  BTS  Technology  Vision.  Together,  the  elements  of  this  vision—
Border  Watch,  Transportation  Watch  and  Border  Net—will  significantly  im-

prove  our  ability  to  provide  the  information  necessary  to  secure  our  borders.
The  foundation  of  the  vision  is  an  architecture  and  a  set  of  technology  pro-
grams that will gather, process and distribute real-time knowledge of the bor-
der and transportation situation and provide decision support tools and labor
saving devices for our security forces.

U.S. Coast Guard

• Integrated  a  major  developmental  program,  HAKWEYE,  into  a  USCG  oper-
ational  prototype  Sector  Command  Center  in  South  Florida.  The  HAWKEYE
program  demonstrates  innovative  technologies  (such  as  Maritime,  Surveil-
lance, Command & Control, Sensor Fusion, and Communications) allowing si-
multaneous  evaluation  of  technology  performance  as  a  direct  impact  on  mis-
sion execution. The Operational Assessment of initial equipment installations
of HAWKEYE at Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, and Key West will be conducted this
year. Focused on the introduction of automated scene understanding and sen-
sor/data  fusion  technology  (a  requirement  for  meeting  manning  constraints.
• Expedited  the  operational  evaluation  deployment  of  a  new  application  for  an
underwater  imaging  device  that  was  in  a  long-term  development  program
within the Office of Naval Research. The device’s development as a small boat
mounted  underwater  inspection  device  for  threats  such  as  improvised  explo-
sive  devices  or  parasitic  contraband  attachments  on  vessels  or  piers.  The  de-

• The  Emerging  Threats  Program  supports  the  Secret  Service’s  continuing,
comprehensive  assessments  of  emerging  threats  and  evolving  technologies
that  pose  a  threat  to  dignitaries  and  assets  protected  by  USSS  personnel.
This  effort  centers  on  the  annual  analysis  of  the  common  attack  methodolo-
gies,  strategies  and  models  of  operation  currently  being  enacted  against  as-
sets  of  a  similar  nature  to  those  protected  by  the  USSS.  This  analysis  is  to
be based on open text information without any information as to the defense,
mitigation, and protection models being enacted by the USSS.
• The  Law  Enforcement  Virtual-Reality  Training  Model  program  supports
prototyping and deployment of a law enforcement security-oriented simulation
training  system  for  the  USSS-specific  training  and  modeling.  Additionally,
this system will enhance the effectiveness of emergency responders during ac-
tual events.
• The  Critical  Structure  Protective  Initiative  (CSPI)  program  will  ensure  con-
tinued  research  and  development  of  network  protection  systems  and  proce-
dures designed to mitigate exploitation of site-specific ‘‘Very Large Scale Inte-
gration’’ (VLSI) control architectures.
• The  Wireless  Tracking  Device  program  supports  development  of  a  handheld,
man-portable  wireless  tracking  device  for  locating  operators  of  wireless  com-
munication  device(s)  in  difficult  radio  frequency  environments  such  as  an  of-
fice building or event stadium.

Emerging Threats

• Established  informal  partnerships  with  the  intelligence  community  and  with
the  USSS  portfolio  to  leverage  ongoing  activities  in  support  of  over-the-hori-
zon assessment.
• Initiated  efforts  Emerging  Threats,  in  combination  with  the  Rapid  Proto-
typing  portfolio,  in  both  near-term  and  breakthrough  solutions  to  homeland
security issues.
• Held a privacy protection workshop in which the technical and policy commu-
nities  interacted  to  identify  important  technical  challenges  and  high  impact
solution areas. Information from this workshop will form the basis of upcom-
ing programs in this area.
• Analyzed  multiple  radar  technologies  and  other  surveillance  strategies  to  de-
termine which combination of technologies would best support coastal surveil-
lance by the USCG.
• Conducted  three  sensitive  projects,  two  in  collaboration  with  the  USSS  and

one addressing a critical infrastructure.

• Sponsored  studies  at  the  Homeland  Security  Institute  to  identify  threat  and
technology  trends  and  develop  a  framework  for  analyzing  emerging  and  fu-
ture threats to homeland security.

Rapid Prototyping

• Solicited ideas, concepts and technologies for 50 requirement areas of interest
to both the Department and other agencies. Efforts have been initiated to ad-
dress chemical and biological threats, explosive detection, training technology
tools, improvised nuclear device defeat, and investigative and forensic support
topics.

• Developed  a  joint  port  and  coastal  surveillance  prototype  designated  HAWK-
EYE with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) that provides an integrated
maritime  surveillance  system  covering  Port  Everglades,  Miami,  and  Key
West, Florida. This first-of-its-kind integrated command center and maritime
surveillance facility opened in July 2004.

• Initiated  the  implementation  of  the  Technology  Clearinghouse  as  required  in
the  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002.  This  clearinghouse  serves  as  the  central
nexus to the public safety and first responder community on: (1) Information
services supporting access to, and dissemination of, information regarding in-
novative technologies serving the DHS mission; (2) Resources designed to sup-
port  the  collaborative  needs  of  teams  serving  the  mission  of  DHS;  and  (3)
Technology programs and resources themselves, designed to serve the mission
of DHS and distributed via a central DHS mechanism. The clearinghouse will
integrate  these  existing  databases  though  a  ‘‘hub  and  spoke’’  configuration
and  allow  a  single  point  of  access  to  multiple  disparate  information  sources.
• Initiated efforts, in combination with the Emerging Threats portfolio, in both
near-term and breakthrough solutions to homeland security issues. Near-term
projects  are  funded  out  of  the  Rapid  Prototyping  Portfolio.  Breakthrough
projects are funded from the Emerging Threats Portfolio.
• Initiated  a  program  to  demonstrate  an  improved  fire  fighting  protective  en-
semble  and  continued  its  further  development.  These  next-generation  gar-
ments will provide dramatically enhanced protection against chemical and bi-
ological  agents  while  improving  the  flexibility,  weight,  durability,  heat  stress
reduction, service life, and costs associated with currently available protective
gear.
• Development  is  underway  in  the  Rapid  Prototyping  portfolio  on  technologies
that  will  enable  response  coordinators  to  locate,  track,  monitor,  and  commu-
nicate with emergency responders in structures.

Counter–MANPADS

• Initiated  and  completed  Phase  I.  In  January  2004,  following  a  competitive
bidding  process,  DHS  awarded  Other  Transaction  (OT)  for  Prototype  Agree-
ments  (OTA)  to  three  companies—BAE  Systems,  Northrop  Grumman,  and
United  Airlines—for  Phase  I  of  a  two-year  System  Development  and  Dem-
onstration (SD&D) effort. During this time, the contractors focused on proving
the feasibility of migrating existing DOD technology into the commercial sec-
tor and exploring other technology as appropriate. Following Preliminary De-
sign  Reviews  with  all  three  companies  in  July  2004,  the  Phase  I  portion  of
the  twenty-four  month  SD&D  effort  concluded  and  DHS  selected  BAE  Sys-
tems and Northrop Grumman to proceed into Phase II to further mature their
preliminary designs, build representative prototypes, install them on aircraft,
and conduct formal testing during the Phase II eighteen month effort.
• Involved  the  commercial  aviation  stakeholder  community  beginning  in  FY
2004  through  a  widely  publicized  industry  day  and  a  series  of  one-on-one
briefings  with  key  commercial  aviation  groups  and  organizations.  In  late
2004, the Program Office hosted a Stakeholders’ Meeting, which was attended
by representatives of the airlines, the equipment manufacturers, and other af-
fected  sectors,  including  representatives  of  multiple  Federal  Government  De-
partments and Agencies.
• Initiated  Phase  II  of  the  Program.  BAE  Systems  and  Northrop  Grumman
were selected to proceed into this phase. Phase II of the program includes ad-
vancing the studies initiated in Phase I, building system prototypes, applying
for and receiving FAA certification of system airworthiness, and effectiveness
testing.

program  were  selected  and  the  Office  has  identified  and  entered  into  agree-
ments  with  the  lead  implementation  contractor  and  lead  web  site  develop-
ment/management  contactor.  The  Office  designed  and  implemented  a  web-
based  application  kit  and  process  with  an  interactive  help  desk.  The  Office
executed a robust outreach program to introduce the industry to the SAFETY
Act program and to encourage its participation. The Office conducted one-day
educational  seminars  across  the  U.S.  inviting  industry,  attorneys,  risk  man-
agers  and  insurance  representatives  to  participate.  Articles  and  interviews
were  conducted  to  further  our  outreach  initiatives.  To  ensure  that  pending
procurement actions are addressed expeditiously and effectively, the S&T Di-
rectorate has created a partnership with federal procurement offices to intro-
duce  them  to  the  program;  the  Office  is  designing  a  mechanism  that  incor-
porates the SAFETY Act program into the procurement process.

• Received  and  has  taken  action  on  30  full  applications  and  120  pre-applica-
tions.  Four  applicants  have  been  awarded  SAFETY  Act  designation  and  cer-
tification: Northrop Grumman, Michael Stapleton Associates, Teledyne Brown
Engineering and Lockheed Martin.

Office of Inter-operability and Compatibility

years for the study of foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. The Center, which
will  be  known  as  the  National  Center  for  Foreign  Animal  and  Zoonotic  Dis-
ease Defense, will work closely with partners in academia, industry and gov-
ernment to address potential threats to animal agriculture including Foot and
Mouth  Disease,  Rift  Valley  fever,  Avian  influenza  and  Brucellosis.  The  Foot
and  Mouth  research  will  be  carried  out  in  close  collaboration  with  DHS’s
Plum Island Animal Disease Center.

• Selected the University of Minnesota and its partners for the National Center
for  Food  Protection  and  Defense  to  address  agricultural  security  issues  re-
lated  to  post-harvest  food  protection.  The  University  of  Minnesota’s  team  in-
cludes  partnerships  with  major  food  companies  as  well  as  other  universities,
including  Michigan  State  University,  University  of  Wisconsin  at  Madison,
North Dakota State University and others. The Department of Homeland Se-
curity  expects  to  provide  the  University  of  Minnesota  and  its  partners  with
$15 million over the course of the next three years to establish best practices
and  attract  new  researchers  to  manage  and  respond  to  food  contamination
events, both intentional and naturally occurring.

• Selected the University of Maryland and its partners as the site for the fourth
Center  of  Excellence  on  Behavioral  and  Social  Research  of  Terrorism  and
Counter-Terrorism. This Center will be funded at $12 million for three years.

• Selected  approximately100  students  for  the  2004  class  of  DHS  Scholars  and
Fellows  bringing  the  total  of  students  to  about  200.  Students  from  the  2003
and  2004  class  participated  in  a  DHS  orientation  for  the  purpose  of  learning
about  DHS  mission  objectives,  the  critical  research  needs,  and  meeting  sci-
entists  from  DHS  laboratories,  Centers  of  Excellence  and  DOE  national  lab-
oratories.  Students  from  both  classes  are  attending  93  institutions  (including
Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Serving Institutions) in
38  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  Seventeen  of  the  institutions  are  lo-
cated in Experienced Programs to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)
states.  Besides  making  immediate  contributions  to  homeland  security-related
R&D,  these  students  will  be  part  of  the  development  of  a  broad  research  ca-
pability within the Nation’s universities to address scientific and technological
issues related to homeland security.

• As part of the DHS mission to maximize interaction with other federal agen-
cies,  University  Programs  and  EPA’s  Science  to  Achieve  Results  (STAR)  Pro-
gram  have  collaborated  on  the  topic  of  microbial  risk  assessment.  The  DHS-
EPA Cooperative Center on Microbial Risk Assessment will result in one five
year  grant  to  a  university-based  consortium  that  is  jointly  funded  by  both
agencies at $10 million.

Critical Infrastructure Protection

• Developed  a  CIP  Decision  Support  System  (DSS)  focused  on  prioritizing  in-
vestment,  protection,  mitigation,  response,  and  recovery  strategies  related  to
Critical  Infrastructure  Protection.  The  prototype  model  includes  representa-
tion of all 14 critical infrastructure sectors, as outlined in the National Strat-
egy  for  the  Protection  of  Critical  Infrastructures  and  Key  Assets,  as  well  as
their  interdependencies.  Preliminary  test  cases  have  been  used  to  develop
consequence estimation features of the CIP–DSS at both national and metro-
politan scales.

• Identified  requirements  for  standards  and  research  and  development  for  Su-

pervisory Control and Data and Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

• Initiated  a  system  study  to  find  potential  solutions  for  personnel  surety  for
security guards that guard our nation’s Critical Infrastructure, as well as in-
siders  with  access  to  sensitive  areas  of,  or  information  about  the  infrastruc-
ture.

• Began National Research Council studies on the security of the Electrical and

Chemical sectors.

• Supported a System Study for Municipal Domestic Water Security, along with
the  Biological  Countermeasures  portfolio,  Chemical  Countermeasures  port-
folio, and Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasures portfolio.

• Initiated interagency development of the first annual National Critical Infra-
structure Protection R&D Plan using the Infrastructure Subcommittee of the
National Science and Technology Council.

Cyber Security

• Initiated  dialog  aimed  at  international  collaboration  on  cyber  security  R&D
with  Canada,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  Japan.  Interactions  with  the  United
Kingdom  and  Japan  are  at  early  stages  and  have  not  yet  reached  the  point
where  potential  joint  R&D  activities  have  been  identified.  Interactions  with
Canada  are  more  advanced,  with  three  joint,  mutually  synergistic  U.S.-Can-
ada  R&D  projects  resulting  from  the  interaction:  (1)  a  secure  wireless  data
pilot  project,  (2)  collaborative  funding  of  an  economic  assessment  study,  and
(3)  development  of  geographic  information  system-based  tools  for  geospatial
mapping of cyber assets.

• Focused  on  securing  the  domain  name  infrastructure  is  working  to  advance
the  diffusion  and  use  of  the  Domain  Name  System  Security  Extensions
(DNSSEC)  protocol  as  a  replacement  for  the  traditional  domain  name  infra-
structure.  Worked  with  federal  researchers  and  officials  and  the  private  sec-
tor  to  develop  a  roadmap  to  accelerate  the  development  and  deployment  of  a
secure domain name infrastructure. Current work also includes the identifica-
tion  of  technology  requirements  and  development  of  models  to  aid  in  assess-
ing  the  performance  impact  of  utilizing  DNSSEC  in  operational  environ-
ments.

• A  second  effort  aimed  at  secure  routing  infrastructure  is  working  to  address
vulnerabilities  in  Border  Gateway  Protocol  (BGP),  the  protocol  associated
with  the  Internet’s  underlying  routing  infrastructure.  This  need  was  also
identified as a priority in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Focused
on  preliminary  planning  for  outyear  activities.  The  development  and  deploy-
ment  path  for  a  secure  routing  protocol  is  expected  be  similar  to  that  of
DNSSEC,  but  will  reach  an  equivalent  level  of  maturity  some  years  later,
with DHS investments aimed at accelerating this process.
• Initiated  a  research  and  development  program  to  fund  the  development  of
next-generation  cyber  security  technologies  in  a  variety  of  topic  areas  includ-
ing: (1) Vulnerability prevention, discovery and remediation through software
assurance  technology,  including  tools  for  development  and  code  analysis;  (2)
Cyber  security  assessment  methods  and  tools,  including  the  development  of
metrics, security analysis, development of benchmarks; (3) Security and trust-
worthiness  of  information  systems,  with  an  emphasis  on  critical  infrastruc-
ture sectors and critical information infrastructure systems; (4) Wireless secu-
rity,  including  foundation  for  new  wireless-based  security  mechanisms  and
services, and security for mobile ad hoc wireless networks; (5) Network attack
forensics,  focused  on  Internet  Protocol  traceback  (tracing  of  data  back  to  its
source)  and  attack  traceback;  and  (6)  Technologies  to  defend  against  identity
theft.
• Development  of  a  security  architecture  for  securing  the  DETER  testbed,  ini-
tial operation of the initial testbed cluster (a scaled-down version of the final
testbed),  development  of  an  initial  hardware/software  design  document,  and
initiation  of  interconnection  of  university  facilities.  Accomplishments  for  the
EMIST  framework  include  development  of  experimental  policies  and  proce-
dures,  calibration  experiments,  operational  Phase  I  experiments  on  the
scaled-down  testbed,  and  documentation  of  additional  attack  scenarios  and
defense mechanisms.
• Initiated a program to address different facets of the need for improved meth-
ods  for  cyber  security  assessment  and  testing,  in  order  to  provide  a  founda-
tion for the long-term goal of economically-informed risk-based cyber security
decision-making. Initiated investigations of two important issues. The first is
the  development  of  a  general  model  for  assessing  the  economic  impact  of
cyber  events  and  attacks  to  verify  or  refute  the  figures  typically  publicized
(e.g., $38 billion for a single Internet worm attack). The second area of inter-
est  is  the  development  of  tailored  business  cases  aimed  at  different  types  of
stakeholder  community  perspectives  (e.g.,  large  enterprises,  critical  infra-
structure  sector  companies,  small  businesses,  home  users,  etc.).  These  activi-
ties  are  aimed  at  putting  better  information  in  the  hands  of  cyber  security
decision-makers  (ranging  from  policy  makers  to  customers  of  commercial  se-
curity technology).
• Development of a trusted access information sharing repository infrastructure
for collecting and sharing data sets among trusted partners, and development
of  a  contractual  and  policy  framework  for  ensuring  trust  among  participants
and  protection  of  data  sets  through  the  Large-scale  Network  Data  Sets  Pro-
gram.

by  representatives  of  the  DOS,  DOT,  DOD  (including  OSD,  OCJCS,  USN,  USA,
USAF, PSEAG, DTRA), DOE, DOJ, FBI, and NIJ. This conference provided a forum
to  share  information  on  detection  approaches  with  the  community  and  encourage
provocative discussions among peers.

The Science and Technology Directorate is sponsoring a suicide bomber conference
scheduled  for  February  2005.  The  primary  focus  of  this  meeting  will  center  on  the
detection  of  suicide  bombers.  Speakers  from  appropriate  government  agencies  will
present  information  about  the  technologies,  both  existing  and  those  in  develop-
mental stages, qualified for detecting explosives carried on the person.

The Science and Technology Directorate has worked closely with TSWG and DOD
in  their  efforts  to  address  the  explosives  threat,  including  participation  in  con-
ferences, technical evaluations, program reviews, and site visits.
Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasures:

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  hosted  an  interagency  Technical  Ex-
change  Meeting  to  provide  a  forum  for  interagency  communication  on  Radiological
and Nuclear Countermeasures research and development.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  participated  in  several  exchanges  with

DOE components working the radiological/nuclear area to consolidate efforts.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  participated  on  the  OSTP  Domestic  Nu-
clear Defense Working Group to facilitate the formation of the Domestic Nuclear De-
fense Office.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  has  a  lead  role  in  the  establishment  of
the DNDO. The DNDO is being stood up as a national office that will be comprised
of  interagency  participants.  The  office  will  be  located  within  the  Department  of
Homeland  Security  (DHS),  but  will  be  jointly  staffed  with  representatives  from
DHS, the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the
Federal  Bureau  of  Investigations  (FBI),  with  coordination  between  the  Department

of  Justice  (DOJ),  the  Department  of  State  (DOS),  the  Intelligence  Community  (IC),
and other departments as needed. Interagency staff will hold principle management
positions within the DNDO when it becomes fully operational.
Standards:

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  interfaces  with  other  government  agen-
cies to facilitate the development of standards for Homeland Security concerns. The
Directorate’s  interactions  with  other  agencies  resulted  in  several  voluntary  con-
sensus  standards  developed  in  concert  with  US  industry  and  accredited  Standards
Development Organizations (SDOs).

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  collaborated  with  DOD  (Army,  Navy),
DOE  (National  Labs),  USDA,  and  DOC/  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Tech-
nology)  and  developed  standards  for  radiation  detectors  for  radiological  &  nuclear
countermeasures.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  collaborated  with  DOC/NIST,  HHS/Cen-
ters  for  Disease  Control,  DOD  (Office  of  the  Secretary,  Army  and  Navy),  FDA,
USDA,  EPA  and  FBI  to  address  detection  standards  for  Bacillus  anthracis  (an-
thrax).  This  interagency  interface  resulted  in  the  development  of  standards  for  de-
tection of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax).

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  succeeded  in  developing  standards  for
personal protective equipment for emergency responders through collaborative inter-
agency  efforts  with  DOD  (Edgewood  and  Natick),  the  DOC/NIST,  and  HHS/NIOSH
(Pittsburgh laboratory).

The Science and Technology Directorate developed standards for biometrics (facial
photograph standards) by partnering with DOC/NIST, DOJ/FBI and Department of
State.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  participates  on  an  OSTP/NSTC  Sub-
committee  on  Standards  that  included  DHS,  National  Research  Council,  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency,  Department  of  Energy,  Health  and  Human  Services/Na-
tional  Cancer  Institute,  DOL/Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  and
Department  of  Defense.  This  Subcommittee  on  Standards  developed  Protective  Ac-
tion  Guides  to  provide  federal  guidance  to  emergency  responders  to  a  dirty  bomb
or nuclear.
Border and Transportation Security:

The Science and Technology Directorate regularly interfaces with the Department
of  Justice  personnel  and  is  involved  in  various  National  Institute  of  Justice  (NIJ)
Office of Science and Technology activities. NIJ convenes a technology review board
which enables technology transition. NIJ also has a Southwest Center of Excellence
for  Public  Safety  Technology.  The  Directorate  has  been  involved  in  the  University
of  Houston’s  educational  workshop  which  is  part  of  the  NIJ  Center  of  Excellence.
The  Directorate  is  also  in  the  process  of  setting  up  a  formal  interface  with  the
Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation.  The  FBI’s  R&D  director  is  a  newly  created  posi-
tion, and the Directorate anticipates meeting to discuss areas of collaboration, tech-
nology information exchange, and technology transition.

Over the past two years, the Science and Technology Directorate has coordinated
extensively  with  the  Department  of  Defense  and  Federal  Aviation  Administration
with  respect  to  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  (UAV)  operations  and  evaluations.  Last
year,  the  UAV  Executive  Steering  Group  (UAV  ESG)  was  established  to  advise  the
Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and  provide  a  forum  for  communication,  coordina-
tion and cooperation to address DHS UAV issues. The UAV ESG is made up of rep-
resentatives  from  DHS  components,  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  Federal
Aviation Administration.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  is  a  representative  on  the  InfoSec  Re-
search Council (IRC). The IRC is an interagency working group that engages in co-
ordination activities at a more technical level than the CIP IWG. The IRC is updat-
ing  the  InfoSec  Hard  Problems  List,  a  report  on  important  information  security  re-
search  challenges  that  was  first  published  in  1999  and  is  in  need  of  updating  due
to the significant advances and evolution in technology in the past five years.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  and  NSF  are  jointly  co-funding  the  two
large multi-university projects that form a Cyber Security Testbed Program and re-
cently  co-sponsored  a  United  States-Japan  Experts  Workshop  on  Critical  Informa-
tion Infrastructure Protection.
Emergency Preparedness and Response:

The Science and Technology Directorate established the Interagency Modeling and
Atmospheric  Assessment  Center  (IMAAC)  in  April  2004.  The  IMAAC  is  currently
operational  and  provides  atmospheric  hazards  predictions  for  incidents  of  national
significance.  Participants  include  DOD,  DOE,  EPA,  NRC,  NOAA,  NASA,  and  DOC.

The  IMAAC  developed  an  MOU  that  establishes  general  operating  principles  and
provides for the development of annexes which detail the department to agency spe-
cific  resource  commitments.  In  addition  to  the  MOU  the  working  group  has  pro-
duced  an  interim  Standard  Operating  Procedure,  currently  is  reviewing  the  tem-
plate  for  annexes,  and  started  discussions  on  other  critical  aspects  of  atmospheric
hazard prediction that will improve the coordination of federal assets.

The Science and Technology Directorate participates in the Federal Committee for
Meteorological  Services  and  Supporting  Research  (FCMSSR).  This  interagency
group provides direct policy guidance to the Office of Federal Coordinator for Mete-
orological Research.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  participates  on  the  Interdepartmental
Committee  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Supporting  Research  (ICMSSR)  and  co-
chairs an interagency Joint Action Group as part of this committee. A collaborative
process was co-led by the Directorate and the Army Research Office, with participa-
tion from DOE, DTRA, Dugway Proving Grounds, EPA NASA, NOAA, and the NRC
to focus on modeling of Atmospheric Transport and Dispersion (ATD). The Joint Ac-
tion  Group,  as  a  subset  of  the  ICMSSR,  developed  an  Atmospheric  Transport  and
Diffusion  Research  and  Development  Plan  that  describes  the  requirements  to  meet
ATD  user-community  needs.  The  R&D  Plan  also  recommends  strategies  to  address
those needs to achieve reliable ATD modeling capability.
Critical Infrastructure Protection:

The  S&T  Directorate  co-chairs  the  Infrastructure  Subcommittee  (ISC)  of  the  Na-
tional  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC),  and  over  twenty  other  government
agencies are members of the ISC. The ISC reports directly to two NSTC committees:
the  Homeland  and  National  Security  (co-chaired  by  the  Directorate)  and  the  Tech-
nology  committees.  The  ISC  developed  the  first  annual  2004  National  CIP  R&D
Plan as well as hosted a Federal CIP R&D Managers Workshop focused on drafting
the 2005 National CIP R&D Plan.

The  Directorate  is  co-sponsoring  a  multi-agency  (including  non-government)  CIP
Roundtable  with  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  that  will  begin  meeting  in  the
upcoming  year.  The  roundtable  is  aimed  at  addressing  the  most  pressing
vulnerabilities associated with critical interdependent infrastructure systems. A dia-
logue  between  government,  industry,  and  academia  will  be  established  to  facilitate
development  of  a  long-term  strategy  for  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  the  Nation’s
infrastructure to debilitating failures, whether from terrorist acts, natural disasters,
or accidental failures.

The Science and Technology Directorate is a member of the DOD Defense Science
Board  Task  Force  on  Critical  Homeland  Infrastructure  Protection.  The  Defense
Science  Board  (DSB)  on  Critical  Homeland  Infrastructure  Protection  (CHIP)  has
concluded  their  assessment  of  US  Homeland  Installations,  and  is  in  the  process  of
writing a report on identifying issues for balancing military and private responsibil-
ities for Critical Facility Protection. The report will also address shortfalls and defi-
ciencies associated with operational security, and gaps in security standards.

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  is  an  ex-officio  member  of  the  Govern-
ment Coordinating Council for Nuclear Power Plants. This Council is one of the en-
tities  established  by  the  National  Infrastructure  Protection  Plan  (NIPP).  In  a  joint
effort,  the  Nuclear  Power  Plant  and  Disposal  Facilities  Government  Coordinating
Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) is conducting Comprehensive
Reviews on all of the Nation’s Nuclear Power Plants used for commercial power gen-
eration.  These  reviews  include  Buffer  Zone  Protection  Plans,  Site  Security  Plans,
Nuclear  Site  Security  Annexes,  On-Site  Emergency  Preparedness  Plans,  Off-Site
Emergency Preparedness Plans, and consideration of the general vulnerability to an
aircraft as a weapon.
Cyber Security:

The  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  co-chairs  the  Critical  Information  Infra-
structure Protection Interagency Working Group (CIIP IWG). The CIIP IWG is char-
tered by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) under the
National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  and  is  co-chaired  by  OSTP.  The
CIIP  IWG  has  membership  from  more  than  twenty  organizations  in  over  a  dozen
departments  and  agencies,  meets  monthly,  and  is  developing  a  coordinated  inter-
agency Federal Cyber Security R&D Plan to guide future funding and programmatic
decision-making in this area.

DISCUSSION

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And thank all of you.
Mr. Kassinger, this is not so much a question but an observation.
To  quote  a  late,  very  popular  President,  ‘‘There  you  go  again,’’  I
note,  once  more,  that  the  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  is
drastically  cut  in  the  proposed  budget.  That,  I  think,  is  unaccept-
able  to  the  Congress  on  a  bipartisan  basis.  One  of  the  few  pro-
grams  designed  to  help  the  small  manufacturer  improve  his  proc-
esses  so  it  can  improve  its  marketing  and  improve  its  employment
opportunities. So please carry the message back that we are enam-
ored  with  the  MEP  program.  We  want  it  to  continue,  and  we  will
work cooperatively with you to try to convince you that you should
be as enthusiastic about it as we are.

Now to Dr. Bement.
I  am  concerned  about  education  at  NSF,  as  I  indicated  in  my
opening statement. My view is that NSF has a unique role in edu-
cation  because  of  its  connections  to  universities,  its  peer  review
process,  and  its  history  of  running  successful  education  programs,
way  back  to  the  teacher-training  institutes  of  the  1960s.  How  do
you  see  NSF’s  role  in  education?  And  why  is  it  being  eroded  so
steadily? Is this a stealth effort to get it out of NSF and over exclu-
sively  in  the  Department  of  Education?  Because  if  it  is,  we  have
detected  the  effort,  and  we  are  going  to  vigorously  oppose  it,  be-
cause we think you do things exceptionally well at NSF. And if we
keep  doing  things  the  same  old  way,  we  will  get  the  same  old  re-
sults  where  our  youngsters  in  science  and  math  education  pro-
ficiency  just  don’t  measure  up  to  their  counterparts  around  the
world.

Dr. BEMENT. Yes, sir. The Administration does support NSF’s re-
search  in  the  area  of  education  at  every  level.  And  they  are  work-
ing  very  hard  to  strengthen  those  programs.  As  a  matter  of  fact,
even  with  the  reduction  in  education,  there  are  enormous  suc-
cesses.  We  have  been  working  with  pilot  school  districts  in  K–12
education  around  the  country.  We  will  never  have  enough  re-

sources  to  deal  with  all  of  them.  But  in  my  visit  to  El  Paso  last
week,  I  saw  one  of  these  success  stories.  The  NSF  has  supported
them  through  the  systemic  initiatives  for  five  years  and  through
the  Math  and  Science  program  for  five  years.  They  are  one  of  the
poorest school districts in Texas with a student population of about
85 percent Hispanic students. And——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Excuse  me.  If  I  may  interrupt,  because  I

have a limited time——

Dr. BEMENT. You want a short answer.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  know  about  some  of  your  successes,  and
boy, I applaud those successes. But it is a funny way to show sup-
port  when  we  have  a  reduction  of  22  percent  below  the  fiscal  year
2004  level.  And  I  know  there  are  some  within  the  Administration,
present company, I think, excepted, who want to put everything in
science and math education in the Department of Education. Well,
that  hasn’t  worked.  And  this  so-called  stealth  attack  is  not  going
to  work,  if  I  have  anything  to  say  about  it.  And  I  am  going  to  get
you more resources. Because if we don’t do a better job in K–12 in
science  and  math  education,  all  of  those  Nobel  laureates  that  Sec-
retary  Bodman  is  bragging  about,  well,  they  are  going  to  diminish
in numbers compared to the Nobel laureates from abroad.

So I want you to carry that message forward.
Dr. BEMENT. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay.
Let  me  turn  to  Dr.  McQueary,  because  you  and  I  have  been  ex-
posed to something that I think is quite important, and that is con-
tainer security technology. And we have had an opportunity to see
some  exciting  developments,  particularly  the  one  company  that  is
developing  an  end-to-end  system  for  tracking  cargo  shipments
while  also  detecting  attempts  to  tamper  or  open  containers  while
in the supply chain.

I  know  from  your  testimony  that  DHS  is  working  on  future
smart  container  initiative,  encompassing  container  security,  com-
munications,  and  data  systems  for  the  future.  Is  this  a  new  start
for  2006?  And  how  much  does  DHS  intend  to  spend  in  the  pro-
gram? And in your view, are we spending enough on this important
area  of  R&D,  because  we  keep  hearing  about  port  security  and
the——

Dr. MCQUEARY. The issue of container security as they come into
this  country  is,  obviously,  extremely  important.  The  complexity  of
the  job  is  one,  as  we  know,  and  all  you  have  to  do  is  go  to  a  port
and  see  the  number  of  containers  that  are  coming  in,  whether  the
correct  answer  is  one  of  having  every  container  have  a  device  on
it  so  that  one  can  know  exactly  what  is  in  it,  about  where  it  came
from  and  so  forth,  is  the  correct  answer,  and  have  someone  moni-
toring  that  all  of  the  time,  or  is  there  a  better  solution  that  lets
us  know  that  when  a  container  is  packaged,  and  then  we  know
what  is  done  with  it  subsequent  to  that  packaging  before  it  gets
into this country. Because we are talking if we were to go down the
path  of  having  enormous—have  a  sensor  in  each  and  every  con-
tainer,  then  we  are  talking  about  having  enormous  data  informa-
tion flow and analysis that is required. And I think it is extremely
important that we know which approach is the one. The work that
we are doing in the science and technology direction is focusing on

preciate that.

Dr.  MCQUEARY.  Sir,  I  would  have  to—I  don’t  have  that  number

two  things.  One  is  the  sensors  themselves,  what  would  be  a  good
sensor. And of course, there is some tremendous work that is going
on in RFID tags, and we believe that we are going to see an answer
there, and I think we will be able to make a recommendation.

Chairman BOEHLERT. How much is involved in this future smart

Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay.
Dr.  MCQUEARY.  But—and  then  the  other  part  is  the—as  I  indi-
cated, is how we put all of this information together, because quite
frankly,  I  think  the  whole  issue,  for  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security,  of  how  you  collect  the  information  disseminated  is  one  of
the largest challenges that we have, a lot more so than just the sci-
entific aspect of it.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  when  you  have  this  array  of  talent
before  you  and  you  have  the  podium,  the  advantage  of  the  Chair,
my  temptation  is  to  just  go  on  and  on  with  my  questions,  but  the
red  light  is  on  for  me.  And  so  I  will  defer  to  my  distinguished  col-
league, the Ranking Member, Mr. Gordon of Tennessee.

Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  There  is  a  lot  to  talk
about, so let me just quickly concur, Mr. Kassinger, with the MEP
program. We all think this is an important productive program for
the country.

And  Dr.  Bement,  science  education  is  cut,  again,  I  want  to  con-

cur, in that science education funding is very important.

Dr.  Marburger,  throughout  your  testimony,  you  sort  of  factored
out, I guess you would say, congressional earmarks to make the fig-
ures  look  better.  Let  me  point  out  that  the  entire  Administration
budget is an earmark. And it would seem that, as an equal partner
in  government,  that  the  Legislative  Branch  might  have  some  good
ideas,  also.  For  example,  as  the  Chairman  pointed  out,  we  would
not  have  a  tsunami  warning  system  now  if  it  wasn’t  for  earmarks
there.  So  you  know,  the  equal  branch  congressional  earmarks  are
very,  very  small  in  comparison  to  the  Administration’s  complete
earmark. So I just want to be sure that we understand that.

And  Dr.  Marburger,  you  again  mention  a  historic  increase  in
R&D over the course of this Administration and record R&D budg-
ets. And while R&D, as a percent of discretionary spending, is rel-
atively  high,  in  historic  terms,  the  federal  R&D  as  a  percent  of
GDP  is  near  a  50-year  low.  And  while  I  accept  your  point  that
weapons systems development can drive innovation and strengthen
economic  competitiveness,  you,  yourself,  have  stated  before  this
very Committee that the federal R&D budget is an imperfect value
for evaluating science and technology funding. Most agree that the
S&T budget is a more exact measure of research funding and that
decreases by 1.4 percent, or $877 million in the request. But if you
want to use R&D, let us use the R&D. The R&D increases by mere-
ly, approximately,  c  percent, which is less than the two percent ex-
pected rate of inflation. So in real spending power, it is a decrease.
Overall, R&D funding for basic research would decrease by 1.2 per-

119

cent and funding for applied research would decrease by $3 million,
again, all less than the two percent inflation.

Now  again,  Dr.  Marburger,  I  do  not  mean  this  as  personal  criti-
cism.  You  are  dealing  with  the  hand  you  were  dealt,  and  if  you
were  the  dealer,  I  think  that  might  be,  you  know,  different.  So
again, this is not personal to you.

Now Dr. Bement, I have got some—I want to go over some things
with you. I have got some questions, and I have staff that is going
to  bring  the  questions  to  you—I  am  going  to  read  them  for  the
record, but so that it will be easier for you, you can have them also.
Dr.  Bement,  although  the  budget  request  shows  a  2.7  increase
for  Research  and  Related  Activities,  the  actual  budget  picture  is
much less positive. Over 40 percent of the increase is an accounting
change,  or  some  might  say  gimmick,  for  how  the  Coast  Guard  is
reimbursed for the use of its icebreakers in support of the National
Science  Foundation’s  science  activities.  As  the  budget  presentation
points out, the actual increase proposed for research projects is ap-
proximately  0.3  percent,  which  is,  as  we  have  pointed  out,  below
inflation.

And  so  here  are  some  questions  concerning  the  icebreaker,  Dr.

Bement.

At  what  level  of  the  Administration  was  the  decision  made  to
give  the  National  Science  Foundation  responsibility  to  assume
more  of  the  icebreaker  operations  and  maintenance  costs  in  fiscal
year  2006?  Is  NSF  the  sole  user  of  the  Coast  Guard  icebreakers,
or do the icebreakers have other missions? What is the current ar-
rangement  for  reimbursing  the  Coast  Guard  for  icebreaker  use?
And how much did the National Science Foundation spend for this
purpose in fiscal year 2004? And how much is projected to be spent
in  fiscal  year  2005?  And  does  the  National  Science  Foundation
have an agreement with the Coast Guard on the cost of use of ice-
breakers  in  2006?  And  is  it  possible  that  the  reimbursement  could
exceed the $48 million budgeted? And finally, and I hope all of this
can  be,  you  know,  crisp,  is  the  National  Science  Foundation  for-
mally  obligated  to  use  the  Coast  Guard  icebreaker  to  meet  its
needs  for  fiscal  year  2006?  Or  is  the  Foundation  free  to  lease  for-
eign  icebreakers?  And  is  leasing  foreign  icebreakers  a  viable  op-
tion?

Dr.  BEMENT.  Thank  you  for  those  questions.  I  will  try  and  be

The estimated cost for maintaining the Polar Sea and Polar Star,
which  are  near  the  end  of  life,  is  around  $70  to  $75  million  over
the  next  two  or  three  years  per  year,  which  greatly  exceeds  the
amount  that  was  provided  through  this  so-called  accounting
change. The decision to give NSF that responsibility came as a re-
sult  of  several  meetings  at  the  White  House  between  OSTP  and
OMB  since  the  dominant  use  of  the  icebreakers  is  in  support  of
science.  But  that  is  not  its  only  use.  In  the  polar  treaty  it  is  also
expected  that  the  United  States  will  maintain  a  presence  in  the
Antarctic, which goes beyond the science. And there are other mis-
sions for ice breaking, which could include navigation, military sup-

The  current  arrangement  for  reimbursement  of  the  Coast  Guard
is that we will reimburse for use of the icebreakers for science sup-
port.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  that  has  been  determined  to  be  $48  million?
Dr. BEMENT. Well, we are currently in discussion with the Coast
Guard  to  develop  an  operating  plan  for  fiscal  year  2006  that  will
be  within  an  affordable  limit  that  we  can  deal  with.  Those  discus-
sions  are  ongoing.  We  should  have  a  determination  later  in  the
spring, and we can share that with you at that time.

Let  us  see.  As  far  as  obligation  to  use  the  Coast  Guard  ice-
breakers,  yes,  by  law,  we  are  obliged  to  use  the  Coast  Guard  ice-
breakers if they can perform a mission. This last year, because the
Polar Sea was laid up, and it takes two icebreakers, one in support
to  free  up  the  lanes  for  logistics  support,  we,  with  their  concur-
rence,  also  looked  at  foreign  icebreakers  that  could  help  support
that  mission.  And  it  turned  out  that  the  only  one  that  was  avail-
able  was  the  Krasin,  which  was  a  Russian  icebreaker,  and  they
performed the mission splendidly well.

Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you  for  helping  enlighten  me  on  this  issue.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Smith.
Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  represent  a  number  of  high-tech  companies,  and  a  particular
interest of mine is nanotechnology. And I know all of the witnesses
know how important that subject is. My question to Dr. Marburger
and  Dr.  Bement  and  Mr.  Kassinger  is  this.  What  is  the  Federal
Government  doing  in  research  and  development  to  promote
nanotechnology,  to  integrate  it  better  with  other  sciences,  and  to
educate the American people about its promise?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Let  me  begin  by  saying  that  each  of  the  people
at the table here do have a stake in nanotechnology. And I believe
at  the  present  time,  13  agencies  are  involved  in  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative.

My  office  does  provide  coordination,  a  very  vigorous  interagency
working  group,  and  operates  the  National  Nanotechnology  Coordi-
nating  Office,  the  NNI  Coordinating  Office,  with  a  paid  executive
who  ensures  that  the  agencies  that  have  something  to  contribute
to  nanotechnology  will  be  involved  in  the  program  and  active.  We
are  vigorously  reaching  out,  not  only  to  the  agencies,  but  also  to
the  community  to  understand  what  their  needs  are.  And  it  is  one
of the high salience programs in this Administration.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you.
Dr. Bement, do you have anything to add to that?
Dr.  BEMENT.  Yes,  we  have  a 

lead  responsibility  for  the
nanoscience  initiative,  the  NNI.  And  we  exercise  that  in  coopera-
tion  with  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  through
interagency  cooperation,  because  we  are  all  leveraging  off  each
other.  We  also  have  international  programs,  and  we  also  have  in-
dustry linkages through SBIR and STTR programs.

We  are  focused  primarily  on  seven  different  initiatives  through
all of these mechanisms. One is fundamental phenomena and proc-
esses,  research  and  nanomaterials,  nanoscale  devices  and  systems,
instrumentation  research  for  nanotechnology,  in  other  words,  how
do  you  measure  down  at  the  level  of  a  proton,  instrumentation  re-

search  for  nanotechnology,  nanomanufacturing,  and  this  is  where
the strong linkages are with industry, major research facilities and
instrumentation  acquisition  and  societal  dimensions,  because  we
are worried about toxicology concerns. We are worried about public
concerns.  We  don’t  want  that  to  block  the  innovation  or  the  even-
tual migration of new technologies coming out of this field into the
marketplace. So we are investing about $44.5 million in that area.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you.
And Mr. Kassinger.
Mr.  KASSINGER.  Mr.  Smith,  we  also  are  heavily  invested  in  this
area. It is one of the three areas I identified as the priorities in my
oral statement, and my written statement has more detailed infor-
mation. But specifically, in our Advanced Measurement Laboratory,
we 
the  National
Nanomanufacturing  and  Nanometrology  facility,  which  will  be  a
brand new facility to work with in cooperation of industry on these
issues.  We  are  putting  another  $4  million  into  nanomanufacturing
research  also  in  connection  with  that  effort.  So  it  is  an  important
focus of attention for NIST.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you very much.
Dr.  McQueary  and  Dr.  Bement,  I  would  like  to  ask  you  about
cyber security. Obviously, one of the great threats to our homeland
security  is  a  breach  in  our  cyber  security  systems.  So  what  is  the
government doing to strengthen our cyber security defenses?

Dr. McQueary.
Dr.  MCQUEARY.  The  science  and  technology  organization  within
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  serves  as  a  support  role  to
the  National  Cyber  Security  Division,  which  is  located  in  the  IAIP
[Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection]  organization.
We have requested about $17 million in support of the R&D activ-
ity.  It  focuses  in  a  number  of  areas.  One  is  in  the  establishment
of a joint laboratory with the National Science Foundation in which
we can actually do cyber security technology testing, if you will, be-
cause  you  don’t  want  to  do  testing  out  on  the  open  Internet.  You
want  to  have  something  that  is  confined  to  be  able  to  do  that.  We
support that activity jointly with them.

And  then  we  are  funding  some  research  in  the  area  of  the  do-
main  name  cyber  security  activities  that  are  going  on,  too.  But  we
really are in a support role, if I may, because we don’t have a char-
ter to go off on our own and independently work that issue.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you.
Dr. Bement.
Dr.  BEMENT.  Yes.  Most  of  our  investment  in  this  area  comes
through  our  Computer  and  Information  Science  and  Engineering
[CISE]  Directorate,  which  directly  addresses  the  President’s—or
the  Cyber  Security  Research  and  Development  Act.  In  addition  to
the investments by that directorate, other directorates are also con-
tributing to developing robust computing systems, which will even-
tually make computing systems much more secure. So we track our
total  investment  at  about  $94  million  and  the  CISE  investment  at
about $69 million, which is a significant increase.

Now that deals not only with secure architectures but secure net-
works  and  also  robust  software  and  intrusion  protection  systems.

Mr. SMITH. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
And  this  committee  is  particularly  proud  of  the  Cyber  Security
the  21st  Century
Research  and  Development  Act  and 
Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. Those are two ini-
tiatives from this committee.

There is good news and bad news in this story. I mean, when you
are  looking  at  nano,  we  have  increased,  more  than  doubled,  fund-
ing from 2001 to the present. And that is good news. That is money
well  spent.  And  when  you  look  at  cyber  security,  it  is  sort  of  flat
spending.  And  Dr.  Bement,  as  we  look  at  your  budget,  we  are  ex-
cited  about  certain  areas  of  it,  but  once  again,  education  takes  a
hit,  and  it  is  down  27  percent  for  cyber  security-focused  education
programs. That is a cause for some concern.

Dr. BEMENT. I should also mention that under the H1–B Visa ac-
count,  we  are  planning  to  invest  about  $100  million  in  not  only
computer and IT training, but also cybertraining, which will partly
offset some of the reductions in cyber security training.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you for that input.
Mr. Costello.
Mr. COSTELLO. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I  would  like  to  join  you  in  welcoming  all  of  our  witnesses  here
today. Mr. Secretary, congratulations on your confirmation, and we
look forward to working with you.

I  have  two  questions,  two  separate  topics.  One  is  that  I  am
pleased,  and  I  think  the  Committee  is  pleased,  that  the  Adminis-
tration  has  again  reaffirmed  their  commitment  toward  the
FutureGen  project,  the  future  generation  power  plant  and  has
called  for  an  $18  million  funding  level,  the  same  appropriation
level as they called for last year. And we are also pleased that the
Department  of  Energy  has  moved  forward  with  the  consortium  in
order to move the FutureGen project forward. We, of course, in Illi-
nois,  believe—there  are  a  number  of  states  that,  I  believe,  are  at-
tempting to convince the Department of Energy and the consortium
that the FutureGen plant should be built in their state. We believe
that Illinois, and in particular, southern Illinois, has all of the nec-
essary  components  to  make  this  project  successful.  And  regardless
of  where  it  is  sited,  we  believe  it  is  a  very  good  project  and  will
help  make  us  become  less  dependent  on  OPEC  oil  and  more  de-
pendent on natural resources from us.

I wonder if you might give us an update as to where we are with
the  future  generation  project  and  comment  about  the  consortium
and  a  date  when  we  can  expect  the  Department  and  the  consor-
tium to make a decision on site selection.

Secretary  BODMAN.  Well,  first  of  all,  Mr.  Costello,  your  number
is  accurate  in  terms  of  the  amount  of  money,  $18  million  in  this
year’s  budget,  and  I  think  it  is  $260-some-odd  million  anticipated
in  the  2007  budget,  which  will  get  us  well  on  the  way  to  funding
this  multi-hundred-million-dollar  project.  We  will  be  meeting  the
coalition;  this  is  to  be  a  partnership  between  public  utilities  and
coal producers with the Federal Government. And so we have been
going  back  and  forth  with  the  coalition,  and  we  will—we  have
scheduled  a  meeting.  I  don’t  have  the  exact  date  in  my  mind,  but
soon,  within  the  next  month  or  two,  I  believe.  That  is  my  best

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00126 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

123

guess.  And  in  order  to  try  to  reach  some  conclusion,  I  think  that,
frankly, there has been some hesitancy on the part of the coalition
to  move  forward  unless  there  is  greater  certainty,  in  terms  of  the
funding.  And  we,  on  the  other  hand,  are  trying  to  stage  this  in  a
way that matches up with the very stringent budget situation that
we find ourselves in.

So  we  are  continuing  to  work  with  them.  And  we  do  believe  in

it. We think this is very important.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Is  it  reasonable  for  anyone  to  assume  that—as-
suming  that  progress  is  made  with  the  coalition,  that  a  decision
might  be  made  by  the  end  of  the  year  as  to  the  location  of  the
plant?

Secretary  BODMAN.  I  have  only  been  there  two  weeks,  sir,  so  I
am  going  to  take  the  fifth  on  that,  if  I  may.  I  don’t  want  to  give
you a date and then be unable to honor it.

Mr. COSTELLO. Sure.
Secretary BODMAN. I would be happy to look into it and give you
a  better  response,  you  and  the  other  Members  of  the  Committee,
if that is of interest to you.

[The information referred to is located in Appendix 2: Additional

Material for the Record.]

Mr. COSTELLO. And I would like to do that, Mr. Secretary.
The  other  point  that  I  would  make,  it  is  really  not  a  question,
and  I  know  that  you  have  only  been  there  a  few  weeks,  so  I  won’t
ask  you  to  make  a  commitment  on  this,  but  I  ask  you  to  consider
it.

This  committee  has  gone  on  record  supporting  external  regula-
tion  for  the  ten  non-defense  civilian  labs  operated  under  the  juris-
diction  of  the  Department  of  Energy.  My  colleague,  Mr.  Calvert
from California, and I have sponsored amendments that have been
approved  in  the  past  through  this  committee.  And  it—every  other
institution,  both  in  government,  education,  and  in  the  private  sec-
tor, is subject to being regulated by external regulation through ei-
ther the NRC or OSHA. We have repeatedly attempted to get these
ten  labs,  and  let  me  say  that  there  were  three  deaths  that  hap-
pened  last  year  and  2004  at  these  labs.  We  have  repeatedly  asked
the  Department  of  Energy  and  others  to  support  external  regula-
tion. So I would ask you to go back and, as you are organizing your
organization in the Department of Energy, to please take a look at
external  regulation  for  those  civilian  labs.  And  at  some  point  in
time, I would like to revisit this with you.

Secretary  BODMAN.  If  I  could  just  respond  briefly,  sir,  and  tell
you  that  the  safety  of  the  employees  of  this  Department  will  have
my  highest  level  of  priority.  My  two  former  colleagues  on  the  left,
Dr. Bement and Mr. Kassinger, can tell you of my days in the Com-
merce  Department  when  we  all  worked  together  there  that  that
was  my  highest  priority  there.  It  will  continue  to  be  in  this  area.
And  I  will  look  into  the  matter  related  to  the  regulation.  I  am
aware  of  your  interest  in  it,  sir,  and  of  your  having  sponsored  the
amendment. All I can tell you is that we share a common goal, that
is  to  say  to  have  a  much  higher  degree  of  certainty  with  respect
to  the  physical  safety  of  all  who  work  in  our  laboratories,  be  they
contractors,  be  they  federal  employees,  or  be  they  subcontractors.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Well,  your  concern  for  worker  safety  is  well
known,  and  I  commend  you  for  that  and  know  that  that  is  one  of
the reasons why I am encouraged that you are the Secretary of the
Department now. And I would look forward to working with you on
this.

Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. EHLERS. [Presiding.] Thank you.
As you probably heard, the bells rang, and we are having a vote.
We  are  trying  to  set  up  a  rotation  scheme  here,  and  so  I  will  ask
questions next, and hopefully another member will come back from
voting and chair by the time I finish.

I  really  have  very  few  questions.  I  have  lots  of  complaints.  And
the point is simply that the funding for science this year is just in-
adequate.  I  would  recognize  the  tough  budget.  I  recognize  tough
times.  I  recognize  the  military  necessities  we  have.  But  we  seem
to  forget  the  important  role  that  research  and  education  plays  in
our national defense and also in our national prosperity. One of the
first tasks I was assigned when I came to the Congress was to try
to  develop  a  statement  of  national  science  policy,  which  really
hadn’t  been  done  since  Vannevar  Bush  did  it  in  1945.  And  we  did
our best. We produced something which was approved by this com-
mittee  and  the  House  of  Representatives.  And  we  made  that  point
very clearly in there. But as part of the process of writing that re-
port,  I  tried  to  find  out  what  the  rate  of  return  on  our  investment
in scientific research was. I gave up. I read a number of papers on
this.  But  I  can  tell  you  that  the  estimates  of  the  rate  of  return  on
our  investment  in  science  range  from  a  low  of  about  25  percent  to
a high of 4,000 percent. Now you can take your pick anywhere be-
tween  there,  but  the  point  is  simply  that  putting  money  into
science research and into math and science education is an incred-
ibly good investment for this country. And yet, I think in this budg-
et,  we  are  being  very  penny-wise  and  pound-foolish  by  not  putting
enough  resources  into  that.  And  when  we  ask  for  some  money  for
the  military,  ‘‘Oh,  yes.  Of  course.  Don’t  you  need  an  extra  $5  bil-
lion?’’  without  recognizing  that  the  money  we  are  putting  into
science  is  likely,  for  the  long-term,  much  more  important  for  the
defense of this Nation than any of the money we are spending this
year on the Defense budget.

I  guess  that  would  be  the  end  of  my  sermon  but  not  the  end  of
my complaining. And when I look at the NSF budget in particular,
two items stand out. First of all, we are supposed to appreciate the
generosity that the National Science Foundation did very well this
year  compared  to  most  other  civilian  agencies.  And  that  may  be,
but when you take the $130 million increase, subtract the $48 mil-
lion  for  the  icebreakers,  we  are  down  to  $84  million,  and  we  find
out  that  we  are  considerably  below  the  fiscal  year  2004  expendi-
tures. In other words, you know, this Congress passed a bill saying
we  should  double  the  funding  of  the  NSF  over  five  years,  which
means  an  average  15  percent  increase,  and  yet  two  years  ago,  we
were  spending  considerably  more  on  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion  than  we  are  proposing  to  spend  next  year.  That  just  doesn’t
make sense. We are going downhill instead of uphill.

When you look at math and science education, a 12.4 percent cut,
last  year  this  committee  conducted  a  special  hearing  on  the  pro-
posal  to  take  money  from  the  National  Science  Foundation  Math
and  Science  Partnerships  and  put  it  in  the  Department  of  Edu-
cation.  I  would  say  this  committee  was  unanimously  opposed  to
that  proposal  and  spoke  strongly  against  it.  We  all  assumed  it
wouldn’t  happen,  and  yet  in  the  omnibus  bill,  it  did  happen.  The
National  Science  Foundation  funding  for  math  and  science  edu-
cation,  which  they  have  done  extremely  well  for  very  many  years,
was cut. And in fact, the National Science Foundation was cut $60
million  below  the  previous  year’s  actual  expenditures.  And  that  is
the  first  time  in  over  10  years  that  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion’s spending has been reduced.

I am not blaming you. I am not blaming the Administration. The
Congress  was  complacent  in  that,  and  they  have  to  take  the  re-
sponsibility.  But  to  cut  it  further—and  I  understand  we  are  in-
creasing  the  spending  for  Math  and  Science  Partnerships  in  the
Department  of  Education.  The  point  is  simply  these  are  two  dif-
ferent  programs  of  two  totally  different  natures.  And  somehow
thinking  that,  ‘‘Well,  we  have  this  program  in  the  Department  of
Education. We want to beef that up. Let us take money away from
the National Science Foundation to do that.’’ And as I told the key
members of the White House dealing with this that that is absurd.
Just  because  it  has  the  same  name  doesn’t  mean  you  have  to  rob
money  from  a  program  that  is  doing  well  and  spend  it  on  another
program that is also doing well. I mean, if they are both good, why
cut one to fund the other?

It  is  very  frustrating  to  me  to  recognize  the  need  and  inciden-
tally,  I  have  been  involved  with  Mr.  Udall,  who  already  went  to
vote,  but  he  and  I  are  co-chairs  of  the  STEM  caucus,  STEM  edu-
cation caucus, Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics edu-
cation  caucus.  I  can’t  believe  the  response  that  we  have  received,
both  from  the  members  and  particularly  from  industry.  We  have
industry groups literally fighting to get on our Advisory Committee
to  help  us.  We  have  had  CEOs  of  technically-oriented  companies
coming  in  to  meet  with  appropriators  and  beg  that  they  will  in-
crease  the  funding  for  math  and  science  education,  because  they
simply  can  not  hire  employees  who  can  do  the  job.  And  we  com-
plain a lot about outsourcing jobs to India and China, but what do
you  expect?  They,  15  years  ago,  recognized  what  had  to  be  done.
They improved their science and math education programs. And so
the  business  is  going  there,  because  they  are  producing  good  sci-
entists, engineers, mathematicians, and we are not.

As I said, this is more in the nature of a complaint than a ques-
tion,  because  I  don’t  think  any  of  you  here  bear  responsibility  for
the  budget  that  has  been  put  together.  I  personally  called  OMB
and  said,  ‘‘Please  do  not  use  last  year’s  NSF  budget  as  a  bench-
mark  for  next  year.  Don’t  pass  the  punishment  on  from  year  to
year.’’  And  unfortunately,  it  didn’t  happen.  We  still  don’t  have  the
funding  there.  And  the  cut  in  the  Department  of  Energy,  again,  is
a  very  large  cut  to  an  organization  that  does  a  great  deal  of  good.
And if we are not serious about solving our energy problems, which
is  what  the  Department  of  Energy  is  supposed  to  do,  I  don’t  know

where we are going to be 15 years from now in trying to deal with
these problems.

My  time  has  expired.  I  apologize  for  unloading  on  you,  but  I
want to get this on the record. And I hope we can all work together
to  try  to  change  this,  certainly  during  this  coming  fiscal  year,  and
undoubtedly for the fiscal year beyond that.

Mr.  Lipinski  is  next,  but  he  has  left.  And  I  am  the  only  one,  so
I  am  going  to  declare  a  recess  while  I  go  vote.  And  Mr.  Boehlert,
I am sure, will be back soon.

The Committee stands in recess.
[Recess.]
Chairman BOEHLERT. We will start again, and I will take the ad-
vantage  of  being  in  the  chair  and  continue  the  questioning  until
some of my colleagues return.

Dr.  Bodman,  let  us  talk  about  DOE  Office  of  Science.  I  think
there  has  been  consensus  inside  and  outside  the  government  that
the  physical  sciences  are  underfunded,  but  the  Office  of  Science,
which funds 40 percent of that research continues to fare poorly in
Administration  budgets.  Doctor,  you  weren’t  at  DOE  when  the
budget  was  put  together,  but  can  you  offer  us  any  insight  on  how
to  reverse  this  trend?  And  if  funding  remains  limited,  what  would
be  the  priority  for  the  Office,  funding  existing  facilities,  starting
new facilities, or funding individual researchers? The current budg-
et proposal, in a way, does badly by all three, postponing or killing
some  new  projects,  cutting  back  on  the  hours  of  existing  projects,
and  cutting  individual  researcher  grants  by  about  10  percent.  I
think  you  can  sense  from  the  tone  of  the  question  that,  speaking
on  behalf  of  the  entire  Committee,  we  are  big  fans  of  the  Office  of
Science, and we think this is an area that demands more attention.
And  you  being  the  new  guy  on  the  block  at  DOE,  I  would  like  to
get some of your insight.

Secretary BODMAN. Well, first, Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased
to  learn  that—or  reinforce  that  the  Committee  is  enthusiastic
about  the  Office  of  Science.  I  share  that,  as  I  mentioned,  in  my
opening  remarks.  The  Office  has  prepared  what  they  have  called
an  outlook,  the  document  that  describes  places  in  priority,  various
initiatives  that  are  on  the  radar  screen  of  the  Office  of  Science.  It
is, I think, a very particularly well done document. It is not a plan
in the sense that it is not a commitment to the funding. And frank-
ly,  what  was  done,  under  the  circumstances  that  we  have  been
dealing  with  in  terms  of  the  financial  support  that  this  Office  has
generated,  is  to  look  at  the  outlook  and  to  make  a  determination,
particularly  for  some  of  the  highest  and  most  costly  undertakings
that  we  have  deferred  those,  frankly.  And  just  in  the  sense  of  try-
ing  to  provide  support  for  those  we  believe  that  we  can  undertake
and not mislead anyone. And so that is what this budget does.

We  are  enthused  about  the  choices  that  have  been  made.  We
think  that  great  progress  can  be  made.  I  intend  to  be  a  vigorous
advocate  for  this  Department  as  we  start  the  discussions  on  the
2007 budget. And in subsequent years, I will do my best to be vig-
orous  and  hopefully  effective.  We  have  great  leadership  in  that  of-
fice, as I have mentioned during my remarks, and I am very enthu-
siastic about it.

I  might  mention,  one  of  the  challenges  of  managing  the  Energy
Department  is  the  fact  that  a  lot  of  what  we  do  is  not  known,
doesn’t  seem  to  get  much  publicity.  I  thought  the  question,  for  ex-
ample,  on  the  nanotechnology  centers,  we  have  got  four  new  ones
that  will  open  up  as  a  consequence  of  this  2006  budget  at  our  na-
tional  laboratories.  It  is,  I  think,  the  second  largest  component  of
the  interagency  effort  and  leading  with  it,  but  the  questions  were
directed at three of my colleagues, and I just wanted to put an aura
in that we also have a major undertaking in that area——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, that is great. And——
Secretary BODMAN.—that combines with theirs.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  As  I  indicated,  from  2001  to  2005,  it  has
more  and  doubled  the  nano  budget,  so  that  is  one  of  the  many
positives in an otherwise very difficult budget. And let me reiterate
to  you  that  we  also  have  great  confidence  in  the  leadership  of  the
Office  of  Science.  We  would  like  to  see  some  followership  in  terms
of  dollars.  And  I  hope  that  you—well,  I  know  you  are  concerned
about  the  trend  down  rather  than  up,  and  I  hope  you  will  work
with us to reverse that.

Secretary  BODMAN.  Well,  I  think  it  is,  as  you  and  I  have  talked
during my days in the Commerce Department, the funding that the
health  sciences  have  benefited  from,  extraordinary  growth  in  sup-
port, where the physical sciences have been level to down for many
years.  And  I  think  this  is  something  that  OMB  is  aware  of,  and
they have got very tough choices to make themselves under the cir-
cumstances that we find ourselves in, so this is what we feel is the
best tradeoff.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Kassinger, let me ask you one.
We  were  enthusiastic  with  the  Administration’s  immediate  re-
sponse  to  the  tsunami,  the  devastating  loss  of  lives  and  property.
And  we  are  supportive  of  the  Administration’s  proposal  to  expand
tsunami  detection  and  warning  capabilities  to  all  U.S.  coasts,  not
just  the  Pacific,  but  all  U.S.  coasts:  the  Atlantic,  Caribbean,  and
the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  NOAA’s  budget  request  cuts  by  nearly  50  per-
cent the Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. Now in Washington
terms,  we  are  not  talking  about  big  dollars,  from  $4.3  million  to
$2.3 million. This program provides funding for education and out-
reach  activities  as  well  as  help  local  communities  with  evacuation
planning,  which  we  happen  to  think  is  quite  important.  And  wit-
nesses at the hearing we had last week stated that these education
activities were almost as important as the technology for detection.
Why  was  the  program  cut  in  half  when  NOAA  is  requesting  $9.5
million for new buoys?

Mr.  KASSINGER.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  NOAA  is  not  only  request-
ing  $9.5  million  into  supplemental  for  new  buoys,  but  another  $14
million  in  the  2006  request  to  build  out  the  system  completely.
That  amount  of  money  doesn’t  just  go  to  buoys.  It  goes  for  all  of
the instrumentation, the seismometers that go with that, the other
programs  to  improve  community  preparedness,  including  edu-
cation,  also,  more  money  for  mapping  of  where  tsunami  inunda-
tions  may  occur.  I  am  not  sure  that  it  is  correct  to  say  that  edu-
cation  is  more  important  than  the  technology  we  are  investing  in.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Believe me, you wouldn’t get the Chairman

of the Science Committee saying that.

128

With  that  said,  all  of  our  expert  witnesses  indicated  the  impor-
tance of education almost as important as the development of tech-
nology, not on that—on an equal level.

But  as  we  look  at  the  Administration’s  request,  and  once  again
applauding it, immediate and comprehensive, except that it is real-
ly  petty  cash  we  are  talking  about.  As  I  looked  at  the  request,  the
total  request,  like  $37.5  million,  it  was  a  little  over  a  million  for
education.  And  I  remember  one  of  the  witnesses  telling  us  a  very
poignant  story  that  an  English  family  was  visiting  Thailand,  a  re-
sort  in  Thailand.  And  the  tsunami  was  coming.  And  a  10-year-old
girl stood on the beach and said, ‘‘That is a tsunami. We just stud-
ied that in school last week.’’ She issued the warning. The parents
went to the management of the hotel. They immediately evacuated
the  beach,  and  I  don’t  know  how  you  put  an  estimate  on  such
things,  but  it  is  claimed,  and  this  story  was  widely  reported,  it  is
claimed  that  this  action  of  the  10-year-old  saved  about  100  lives.
I  guess  the  point  is,  a  million  and  a  half  is  not  very  much  for
education.  So  while  we  are  not  suggesting  that  we  take  it  out  of
the  money  for  buoys,  and  we  are  not  saying  write  a  blank  check,
but  I  would  hope,  as  you  examine  this  request,  that  we  can  work
together  and  perhaps  get  some  more  in  there  for  education  and  to
help communities on our own—in our own country with evacuation
plans.

Mr. KASSINGER. We will certainly take a look at that, Mr. Chair-

man.

elists.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  do  appreciate  it.
Mr. Honda.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome to the pan-

I have a question—a comment and a question for Mr. Kassinger.
The MEP is a State-federal partnership, and every federal dollar
is  leveraged  by  $1  of  state  funds  and  $1  in  fees  for  service.  And
every  year,  since  the  Administration  has  proposed  cutting  MEP
funding,  we  have  asked  what  consultation  have  you  had  with  the
states.  And  every  year,  we  get  the  same  response  that  we  will  be
doing  that  in  the  future.  So  have  you  had  any  discussions  to  date
about this year’s federal funding level?

Mr.  KASSINGER.  We  have  not  consulted  with  the  states  on  this
year’s  funding  level,  Mr.  Honda,  because  our  feeling  is,  of  course,
we  needed  to  talk  to  you  first  on  the  Hill.  But  we  will  be  doing
that.  Our  proposal  is  to  reduce  the  federal  share,  but  we  feel  like
the amount we proposed will be sufficient to maintain the national
system of centers. And the question is, as you, I think, are alluding
to,  what  is  the  appropriate  sharing  relationship?  How  can  we  help
our—work with our partners to find other sources of funding to the
extent the states and communities want to do more with these cen-
ters?  I  know  of  the  strong  interest  in  the  Committee  in  this  pro-
gram,  as  voiced  by  Chairman  Boehlert  and  Mr.  Gordon,  and  we
will continue to work with our partners on the program.

Mr.  HONDA.  There  was  a  recent  study  commissioned  by  the  De-
partment  of  Commerce,  and  the  outcome  was  something  like  the
small  manufacturing  market  is  underserved  in  terms  of  assistance
with  the  productivity  and  performance  improvement  measures.
And  given  this  finding  and  increasing  pressure  of  global  market

129

competition  on  small  manufacturers,  doesn’t  it  feel  like  we  should
be increasing the funds rather than cutting them back in order for
us to be more economically viable?

Mr. KASSINGER. Well, again, Mr. Honda, we support maintaining
the  national  system  of  the  MEP  centers,  but  in  a  time  of  tight
budgets,  the  question  is  how  large  the  federal  share  should  be  of
that.  If  the  program  is  so  successful  and  valuable,  we  would  hope
that  others  would  support  that  with  additional  money.  We  will  be
talking  to  our  federal  partners,  as  we  did  last  year,  about  other
sources of funds within the Federal Government as well.

Mr.  HONDA.  Okay.  And  then  relative  to  ATP,  and  I  will  change
the  question  slightly  from  the  last  couple  of  years.  How  seriously
are  we  supposed  to  take  your  proposal  to  terminate  the  program
given  that  you  haven’t  provided  funding  to  execute  this  elimi-
nation?  You  would  have  to  reassign  or  eliminate  at  least  228  posi-
tions.  And  that  cost  could  be  as  high  as  about  $20  million  to  do
this. And ATP is expected to fund about $13 million worth of R&D
at  the  NIST  labs.  So  if  ATP  ceased  to  exist,  it  would  cost  NIST  as
much  as  $33  million  to  pick  up  that  effort.  And  this  would  eat  up
most of the proposed increase for the labs, if I read the budget cor-
rectly.  So  either  we  are  supposed  to  believe  that  you  really  don’t
want  to  increase  NIST  lab  funding  or  that  you  really  are  not  seri-
ous  about  terminating  ATP.  Could  you  explain  which  it  would  be?
Mr.  KASSINGER.  There  is  a  third  alternative  and  that  is  we  are
very serious about our proposal to eliminate the ATP program. You
are  correct  that  there  would  be  transition  costs.  We  believe  those
are  manageable  within  the  budget.  I  think  it  is  premature  to  esti-
mate,  or  even  speculate,  about  the  number  of  positions  that  we
would  have  to  reduce,  for  example,  or  how  much  intramural  fund-
ing we would have to reduce.

There  are  several  reasons  for  this.  For  example,  every  year,  we
know  that  there  are  parts  of  the  ATP  grants  that  are  terminated,
and that leaves money. We don’t know how much that will be this
year,  but  history  teaches  that  there  will  be  several  million  dollars
available to contribute to these other transitional costs.

The other point I would like to make is that the increase in labs
that  we  are  proposing  of  nearly  13  percent  would  be  built  into  the
base.  That  is  a  permanent  commitment  by  the  Administration  to
build  up  what  we  regard  as  the  real  core  NIST  programs.  ATP  is
a program that has had some successes over the year, but it clearly
is not a core mission of NIST in these days.

So we think we can manage the transition, and we are very seri-

ous about transferring the focus to the core NIST programs.

Mr. HONDA. So it sounds like you will continue it, but it will con-
tinue through attrition so that it will hit zero some time in the fu-
ture.

Mr. KASSINGER. Well, our program—our plan, if Congress agrees
with  our  proposal,  would  be  to  wind  up  the  ATP  program  in  2006,
so  it  won’t  be  an  indefinite  into  the  future  situation.  We  believe
that we can manage this with our proposed funding.

Mr.  HONDA.  Since  I  still  have  a  little  bit  more  time,  Secretary
Bodman,  I  am  looking  at  the  budget  for  energy  efficiency  and  re-
newable  energy  programs,  and  I  am  a  little  bit  puzzled.  The  Ad-
ministration  is  making  the  long-range  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  a

130

big focus, but as you well know, hydrogen is not an energy source.
It  is,  rather,  an  energy  carrier.  And  for  the  initiative  to  succeed,
we are going to have to come up with some way to produce hydro-
gen in a way that must be sustainable. And so otherwise, we might
continue  to  deal  with  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  problem.  We
won’t  end  our  dependence  on  finite  fossil  fuel  supplies.  But  this
budget  cuts  funding  for  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy
programs  by  11  percent.  Dr.  Secretary,  can  you  tell  me  where  the
hydrogen  is  going  to  come  from  if  we  don’t  develop  the  means  to
produce it?

Secretary BODMAN. There are a variety of ways of producing hy-
drogen. One is electrolysis that could be readily carried out in con-
junction with nuclear power, one of the initiatives that the Admin-
istration  has  argued  for  and  continues  to  aspire  to  is  an  increased
use  of  nuclear  energy,  which  has  the  advantage  of  not  producing
any  carbon  dioxide  or  other  oxides  of  carbon.  Electrical  energy
could  be  used  for  the  generation  of  hydrogen.  There  are  also  some
other  higher  temperature  cycles  that  have  been  discussed  in  con-
nection  with  the  nuclear  program  that  could  also  lead  to  the  pro-
duction  of  hydrogen.  And  then  some  of  the  coal  technologies,  the
FutureGen  project  in  the  coal  area  calls  for  hydrogen  production
itself.  And  so  there  are  a  number  of  other  initiatives  that  would
produce hydrogen. You are quite right in characterizing it as an en-
ergy  carrier.  That  is  what  it  is.  And  it  has  the  advantage  of  pro-
ducing  water  as  a  byproduct,  which  is  something  that  is  quite  be-
nign in the environment.

Mr.  HONDA.  You  mention  a  couple  of  sources  for  energy.  Are

there other——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  gentleman  indicated  before  that  you
had  a  little  time  left,  and  I  noted  it  was  just  one  second.  You  are
right: there was a little time. And now you are considerably——

Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—over that, Mr. Honda.
Mr.  HONDA.  If  you  don’t  mind,  then,  I  would  like  to  submit  the

rest of my questions to the individuals in writing and——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Oh, without——
Mr. HONDA.—I would like a written response.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Without any objection, because as the wit-
nesses  know,  this  committee  has  a  penchant  for  submitting  ques-
tions  in  writing  following  your  testimony.  It  gives  you  some  time
to think about your answers. We would hope for a timely response,
which would enable us to do our jobs.

Mr.  HONDA.  Yes.  And  one  other  comment,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  ap-
preciate  having  this  hearing,  but  each  one  of  those  gentlemen  can
provide  a  sufficient,  you  know,  conversations  and  questions  and  I
ask for——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Oh, yeah.
Mr.  HONDA.—a  hearing  in  and  of  itself,  so  maybe  some  time  in

the future we could arrange that.

Thank you very much.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  I  am  so  glad  that  you  brought  up
MEP  again.  I  think  you  got  the  message,  Mr.  Kassinger  and  Dr.
Marburger.  I  mean,  look  at  the  whole  genesis  back  in  1988  when
we  established  MEP,  we  looked  at  one  of  the  most  successful  pro-

grams  in  the  history  of  the  Republic,  cooperative  extension.  And
that  has  enabled  American  agriculture  to  be  the  most  productive
agriculture  economy  worldwide.  And  I  remember  at  that  time,  Dr.
Frank Rose was President of Cornell University. Mr. Secretary, you
are  fond  of  that  great  institution.  And  I  said  to  myself,  ‘‘Why  not
something  for  manufacturers,  particularly  the  small  manufactur-
ers,  patterned  after  cooperative  extension?’’  And  that  is  sort  of  the
genesis  of  the  program.  But  we  keep  fighting  every  year  with  the
Administration.  I  mean,  this  is  not  a  gift  to  small  manufacturers
who  desperately  need  assistance:  B  Federal  Government,  B  State,  B
users.  I  mean,  that  is  a  pretty  fair  arrangement.  And  if  you  are—
Dr.  Marburger,  if  you  are  going  to  cut  the  program  by  60  percent,
I don’t see how in the hell you can maintain the same national net-
work.  Does  that  mean  you  are  going  to  eliminate  half  of  the  cen-
ters?  And  then  what  kind  of  a  national  network  do  you  have?  I
mean,  this  is  something,  as  I  think  you  can  sense  from  my  com-
mentary, but from others like Mr. Gordon and Mr. Honda, on both
sides,  this  is  one  program  designed  to  help  the  small  manufactur-
ers in America. I am sort of tired of seeing so much go beyond our
borders. I would like to help those within. But I don’t want to give
them a gift; I want to give them a helping hand. So can you assure
me that we will maintain a national network under the modest re-
quest from the Administration?

Dr. MARBURGER. I think Mr. Kassinger’s commitment to the pro-
gram  was  well  characterized  in  his  remarks.  There  is  a  question
of  priorities  here.  And  I  think  that  one  of  the  key  decisions  that
had  to  be  made  was  to  balance  the  long-term,  enormous  impact
that  the  work  that  the  NIST  core  budget  supports  in  research,
basic research for new technologies, future technologies versus, ad-
mittedly, an immediate, relatively small leverage impact compared
to  the  huge  impact  of  the  core  budget.  That  is  one  of  the  consider-
ations  that  I  am  aware  of.  But  we  are  not  arguing  that  the  pro-
gram is not valuable. I believe the program is valuable. And we felt
that  the  funding  that  is  in  this  request  is  adequate  to  support  it
during these times.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Guess what? We don’t agree, but that was
a  very  skillful  answer  from  a  very  professional  witness.  We  do  ap-
preciate that, but we are talking long-term, too, and we would like
there  to  be  longer  term  for  a  lot  of  the  small  manufacturers  who
might no longer be in business absent some input from these MEP
centers,  which  I  think  are  proving  very  productive.  But  this  con-
versation will continue.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Let me note that today’s discussion is taking place in the context
of a level of deficit spending of $500 billion a year. And that is why
we are here. That is why there is some pressure. That is why peo-
ple  are  talking  about  various  issues  that  we  are  talking  about
today. But if we didn’t have a $500 billion level of deficit spending,
it would be a whole different discussion, or at least it should.

When you have these types of economic pressures, I find it a bit
disturbing that the discussions that we have had have not centered
on  what  are  you  doing  to  cut  spending  or  what  are  you  doing  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

132

cut  out  the  most  wasteful  or  least  productive  spending  that  you
have had under your jurisdiction. And that doesn’t seem to be what
has  been  discussed  at  all  today.  In  fact,  we  are  discussing  why  we
aren’t spending more in certain areas. When I was a speechwriter,
people  would  always  come  to  me.  I  was  a  speechwriter  for  Presi-
dent Reagan for seven years. And then they would come to me and
say,  ‘‘You  have  got  to  cut  down  the  length  of  this  speech.  And  by
the way, we want you to include this, this, and this.’’ And it is the
same  principle.  And  either  we  are  serious  about  this  $500  billion
deficit or we are not.

Let me ask you this, Dr. Marburger. Did you say earlier on that

you were going to increase spending for fusion energy?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  did  not  say  that  we  are  going  to  increase
spending  for  fusion  energy.  I  don’t  have  that  particular  number  at
my  fingertips,  but  this  Administration  does  support  continued
progress  on  nuclear  fusion  as  an  energy  source  in  the  distant  fu-
ture.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Maybe  you  could  outline  for  me  the  great
progress we have had on fusion energy. Quite frankly, I did a study
on  that  a  number  of  years  ago  and  found  that  it  was  the  least—
had the least amount of progress of any of the energy research that
was  taking  place,  and  it  was  receiving  hundreds  of  millions  of  dol-
lars. Maybe somebody could enlighten me as to what has happened
in the last few years that justifies changing that opinion.

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Right.  In  just  a  few  words,  some  things  have
happened in the last few years that justify changing that, and one
of them is the development of the instrumentation that permits us
to understand—to peer into the interior of these very complex ma-
chines and measure the conditions there. Another important break-
through  is  the  quality  and  strength  of  our  computing  power  that
allows  us  to  simulate  and  numerically  design  devices,  these  very
complex  devices,  for  containing  the  very  high-temperature  fusion
plasma.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, has there been any——
Dr. MARBURGER. And there have been important advances in the

comparison between what we——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Have  we  seen  any  advance  in  the  actual—I
mean, the last time I heard it was less than a second blip of fusion
reaction. Has there been any greater length than that?

Dr. MARBURGER. It is necessary to build a larger machine to see
the physical phenomena that now stand in the way—may stand in
the way of future development.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I am very——
Dr. MARBURGER. That is what ITER is all about.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  am  very  interested  in  that,  and  if  you
could—your  office  or  someone  else  send  me  something  that  would
show me the progress that we have had. I think it was four or five
years  ago  that  we  actually  analyzed  fusion  and  found  it  to  be——
Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  would  be  glad  to  do  that  in  cooperation  with

the Department of Energy.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. And Secretary Kassinger, in that same

things that could really be done at NOAA much cheaper is to actu-

Does NOAA still have a navy all of these years?

erates the NOAA—the officer corps, which——

Mr. KASSINGER. Yes, we have fisheries research vessels and map-
ping vessels that they are the officers for. They—you know, we——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Is  there  any  reason  why,  if  that  could  be
done  in  the  private  sector  at  considerable  savings,  that  we
shouldn’t be doing that?

Mr.  KASSINGER.  If  that  were  the  proposition,  that  would  be  the
case, but we have looked at that, and it is not evident that savings
are available.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, I can tell you we had hearings on it six

or seven years ago, and I remember it was very beneficial.

Mr. KASSINGER. We have contracted out in the last year or so for

some oceanographic mapping services.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  I  would  suggest  that  when  you  are—
when we are facing these kind of budget crunches that we need to
look  at  privatization.  We  need  to  look  at  every  alternative  that  we
can.  And  we  mentioned  the  nanotechnology  that  $45  million  was
being  spent  for  commercialization  of  nanotechnology.  Is  that  what
you said?

Mr.  KASSINGER.  Not  commercialization,  but  we  are  investing  in
the  advanced  measurement  laboratory  at  NIST  where  we  are  put-
ting  that  money  into  facilities  that  will  be  joint  industry  govern-
ment research facilities.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  People  suggest  that  nanotechnology  is  going
to be incredibly profitable, and it is going to have an incredible im-
pact on our economy, and thus our large corporations will be mak-
ing  big  profits  with  nanotechnology.  Have  we  done  anything  to
build  a  payback  into  the  system  so  that  the  nanotechnology  devel-
oped  by  our  research  projects  will,  in  some  way,  be  paid  for  by
those  commercial  entities  that  are  using  them  for  profit  in  the  fu-
ture?

Mr. KASSINGER. The users of the facility contribute to the cost of

using the facility.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Mr.  KASSINGER.  We  have  not—if  you  are  suggesting  have  we
taken  an  override  on,  say,  patent  royalties  or  something,  no,  we
have not.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Right.  Well,  I  would  suggest  that  instead  of,
Mr. Chairman, instead of complaining that the glass is half empty
or half full, that we should be looking at ways like that of making
sure that the people who benefit from these investments, especially
big corporations, will pay in the future for the type of research that
is  being  done.  And  number  two,  I  would  hope  that  when  there  is
any private sector alternative that is cheaper for us to do, like the
NOAA navy, that we should be going in that direction.

And I appreciate you very much.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much  for  your  comments.
The gentleman’s points are well taken.
I  would  commend  to  him  for  his  reading  the  current  issue  of
Business  Week,  which  has  a  cover  story  on  nanotechnology,  which

gives an exciting forum, the great promise this holds for the future
of  our  economy.  And  I  would  further  point  out  that  in  all  of  our
dialogue  with  our  very  distinguished  witnesses,  we  have  not  men-
tioned  a  number  of  areas  that  are  proposed  for  reductions,  but  we
have pinpointed those areas that we think it would be wise to con-
sider increases. Because as we have learned from the great revolu-
tion of the ’90s when we had 10 consecutive years of growth in our
economy,  everything  was  going  up:  more  jobs,  more  opportunity,
more  exciting  products.  That  was  a  technology-driven  drive  up-
ward.  And  our  investment  in  technology  and  science  and  tech-
nology paid very handsome dividends for America.

So  we  are  talking  about  a  modest  program  like  the  Manufac-

turing Extension Partnership——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  If  you  would  indulge  me  just  one  thought,
and  that  is,  we  talked  about  cyber  security.  Obviously,  the  compa-
nies  that  are  going  to  most  benefit  from  cyber  security  technology
are  these  big  computer  companies.  Why  aren’t  we  making  sure—
and  that  was  going  to  be  another  question  that  I  didn’t  have  time
for,  why  aren’t  we  making  sure  that  those  companies  are  going  to
have  to  pay  for  the  research  that  is  going  to  give  them  this  great
profit in this new technology?

Just a thought.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Let me tell you, the greatest beneficiary of
advances  in  cyber  security  will  be  the  United  States  Government.

The Chair now recognizes Mr. Matheson.
Mr.  MATHESON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  do  agree  with  you

on MEP, just so you know.

Energy.

Dr. Bodman, welcome to your new position at the Department of

I would like to put up a slide, if I could.
[Slide.]
That  is  a  picture  of  a  site  near  the  Colorado  River  near  Moab,
Utah. This is a site right now that is controlled by the Department
of Energy. And I noticed in the budget, under the line item of accel-
eration completions, that there is a $20 million increase in this cat-
egory,  which  would  include  projects,  such  as  this  site  in  Moab.  By
background, this site is a 10.5 million-ton pile of uranium tailings.
It  is  leaking  into  the  Colorado  River,  where  there  are  over  25  mil-
lion users downstream.

And if I could put up slide number two.
[Slide.]
Congress passed a law, which the President signed into law, that
indicated  that  this  site  should  be  moved,  that  the  tailings  pile
should  be  moved  to  another  location  within  the  State  of  Utah.  I
will pause a second if people want to read that.

The reason I point this out is that after Congress passed this law
saying that it ought to be moved, Congress also asked the National
Academy  of  Sciences  to  do  a  study  of  this  site.  And  the  National
Academy report indicated the current site is unstable and that the
scenario where the Colorado River ultimately would run across the
site  is  a  near  certainty.  And  a  recently  completed  U.S.  Geological

135

Survey  report  verified  the  findings  of  the  National  Academy  of
Sciences report.

And  so  it  is  interesting  that  right  now—we  could  go  back  to  the

first slide again, just so people can see the picture.

[Slide.]
It  is  interesting  right  now  the  Department  of  Energy  is  under-
taking  an  environmental  impact  statement  to  evaluate  what  to  do
to  mitigate  this  problem.  And  in  the  environmental  impact  state-
ment  process,  the  draft  that  was  issued  listed,  as  some  of  the  op-
tions,  leaving  the  pile  in  place,  which  is  in  direct  contradiction  to
what Congress said the Department of Energy ought to do. In fact,
this draft environmental impact statement that came out from the
Department  of  Energy,  didn’t  list  a  preferred  alternative,  which  I
thought was kind of unusual not to list one, so hope springs eternal
that  the  preferred  alternative  in  the  final  EIS  perhaps  will  be  to
move the pile, as Congress has asked that it be done.

But  I  noticed,  as  I  said,  in  the  budget,  an  increased  amount  of
money  going  into  that  account  compared  to  what  had  been  spent
in  previous  years.  And  I  guess  I  wanted  to  ask  you  if  you  had  a
sense of why this account was increased and what impact it would
have for fiscal year 2006 on remediation activities at this site. And
secondly,  I  would  like  to  see  if  you  had  any  sense  of  why  the  De-
partment’s  draft  environmental  impact  statement  included  options
under  consideration  that  are  in  contradiction  with  public  law
passed by the Congress?

Secretary  BODMAN.  I  am  familiar,  sir,  with  the  existence  of  the
site  and  the  history  of  it,  how  it  originated,  and  how  it  ended  up
under  the  care  of  the  Department  of  Energy.  I  am  aware  of  that.

Mr. MATHESON. All right.
Secretary  BODMAN.  I  am  aware  that  there  is  an  environmental
impact statement being prepared. I can’t comment on whatever al-
ternatives  were  being  considered  are  or  are  not  in  agreement  with
federal  law.  I  can  assure  you  that  this  Department  will  not  know-
ingly violate federal law. There may be differences of opinion as to
what the law says. I can’t——

Mr. MATHESON. I understand.
Secretary BODMAN.—speak to that. And I can tell you that since
this  is  now  my  responsibility,  I  will  pursue  this,  as  I  will  every
other part of my responsibility, with vigor.

Mr. MATHESON. Well, I appreciate that. I appreciate, with a new
person  in  charge,  the  opportunity  for  new  vigor  to  pursue  some  of
these things.

I  would  also  add  that  an  independent  study  by  scientists  of  the
University  of  Utah  has  found  that  the  radioactive  contamination
has gone underneath the river and is approaching the groundwater
supply  for  the  town  of  Moab.  Not  only  the  25  million  users  down-
stream face a long-term issue of concern, but there is an immediate
issue  of  concern  for  the  residents  living  right  in  the  area.  And  I
would  encourage  you  and  the  folks  in  the  Department  to  take  a
look at this draft EIS, and when you publish the final EIS, I would
encourage folks to consider what public law said.

And  lastly,  on  that  EIS,  I  would  encourage  people  to  look  at  the
overall  long-term  life  cycle  cost  of  the  different  options,  because  if
we  cap  it  in  place,  I  think  there  will  be  a  longer  cost  over  time.

There  is  a  higher  up-front  cost  in  moving  the  tailings  pile  today,
but  I  think  there  is  a  higher  long-term  cost  if  we  leave  them  in
place.  And  my  concern  is  short-term  cost  considerations  are  going
to trump the right decision that ought to be made. And that is the
message I wanted to deliver to you today.

Secretary  BODMAN.  Your  message  has  been  delivered  and  re-

ceived, sir.

Mr. MATHESON. Well, I appreciate that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  gentleman’s

The  distinguished  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Research,

time has expired.

Mr. Inglis.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You  know,  it  seems  to  me  that  in  the  President’s  budget,  what
he  is  attempting  to  do  is  what  we  all  must  do.  He  is  attempting
to  focus  on  the  most  needful  priorities.  Simple  spending  must  give
way  to  thoughtful  investing.  If  it  produces  a  return,  invest  it.  If  it
doesn’t, cut our losses.

Investments in innovation make an awful lot of sense. Our future
depends  on  innovation.  And  one  of  the  ones  that  I  am  particularly
excited  about  that  Secretary  Bodman  mentioned  was  the  Presi-
dent’s  hydrogen  initiative.  We  have  an  exciting  opportunity  in
South Carolina involving BMW and Michelin in funding a graduate
Department of Engineering at Clemson University that, along with
Microsoft  and  IBM,  would  partner  to  create  an  opportunity  to  de-
velop smart cars and fuels of the future. BMW has a hydrogen car
right  now,  a  direct-burn  hydrogen  car.  If  we  went  to  Spartanburg
right now, we would see it.

So Mr. Secretary, the question I have for you is when will we be
seeing  some  fuel  for  that  car?  And  what  can  we  do  to  hasten  that
day  that  we  could  actually  drive  it  out  of  the  BMW’s  interim  and
up to the 300-mile radius that it is about to achieve?

Secretary  BODMAN.  First,  I  am  pleased  to  hear  that  you  are  as
enthusiastic about the prospects for our hydrogen-powered vehicles
as  I  am.  Secondly,  there  are  some  experimental  stations  being  set
up  that  do  provide  for  hydrogen  in  limited  quantities.  I  think  be-
fore a more extensive network is put in place, the effectiveness and
the cost effectiveness of the technology has to make some progress.
At  least  that  is  my  preliminary  view.  I  have  not  gotten  into  detail
on  it.  I  have  not  looked  at  the  BMW  car,  and  I  don’t  know  what
its  cost  might  be  in  terms  of  if  it  were  in  mass  production.  But  as
a  general  matter,  these  vehicles  and  the  technology  involved  in
them  remains  very  costly.  And  therefore,  there  remain  doubts  as
to  how  rapidly  the  technology  could  be  moved  to  the  bulk  of  our
population.

We  continue  to  fund  efforts  at  identifying  the  technical  chal-
lenges  involved  in  developing  fuel  cell  or  hydrogen-powered  vehi-
cles,  one  of  which  is  carrying  enough  hydrogen.  And  that  is  a  real
challenge  to  get  enough  hydrogen  on  board  and  how  do  we  store
it  and  how  do  we  do  it  under  pressure  conditions  that  are  accept-
able  in  terms  of  the  safety  of  the  occupants  of  the  vehicle.  So  we
are  continuing  to  work  on  it.  I  don’t  have  a  fixed  date  for  you——

Mr. INGLIS. Right.

Secretary BODMAN.—that I would have any confidence in.
Mr. INGLIS. You know, it is also exciting that at Savannah River
Site, which of course is under your jurisdiction, we have a long his-
tory  of  dealing  with  tritium  under  pressure  and  storage  issues
there. So hopefully we can have some of that expertise apply to this
question. And we are very excited about that.

Dr.  Bement,  you  may  have  answered  this  question  while  I  was
voting  in  another  committee,  but  the  question  about  whether  the
change  in  the  education  funding  is  just  a  function  of  tight  budget
times or whether it reflects a policy decision or a different direction
that you are taking.

Dr.  BEMENT.  I  think  it  is  some  of  both,  Mr.  Inglis.  Fist  of  all,  in
order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  our  priorities,  especially  in
broadening  participation,  we  did  shift  some  funds  out  of  under-
graduate  education  and  shifted  it  in  broadening  participation,  be-
cause  about  o  of  that  funding  is  really  undergraduate  education,
not  only  in  research  universities,  but  four-year  colleges  and  com-
munity colleges. So the base is much broader than what you might
see in a table where you are only looking at one element.

The total investment in broadening participation, if you just look
at the programs of congressional interest, would be about $400 mil-
lion,  but  if  you  look  at  the  total  investment,  including  all  of  the
science  directorates  in  the  offices,  it  is  more  like  $597  million.  So
that is a very large investment in education.

Now to get to the second part of your question, and I want to go
back  to  the  question  I  didn’t  quite  finish  with  the  Chairman,  we
have  school  districts  that  have  made  phenomenal  progress.  They
know  what  works,  and  they  know  what  works  because  their  test
scores  show  that  they  work.  And  if  I  could  just  refer  back  to  the
El Paso School District again, that school district is 85 percent His-
panic,  and  over  the  past  10  years,  they  have  closed  the  gap  be-
tween  the  performance,  not  only  at  11th  grade,  but  at  3rd  grade,
between  white  students,  Hispanic  students,  and  African  American
students.  And  they  are  outperforming  almost  every  other  school
district in Texas.

So  there  are  lessons.  There  are  best  practices.  There  is  knowl-
edge there that can be applied to every school district in the coun-
try. So what is necessary now is to propagate that knowledge. And
that is what we work with the Department of Education to try and
bring about, because the impact that we can have is small, but the
impact  that  they  can  have  by  propagating  those  lessons  can  be
quite large.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Might  I  indicate,  as  always,  my  appreciation  to  the  Ranking
Member and the Chairman. But with that appreciation goes a con-
cern that each of these representatives really require, for any kind
of  adequate  oversight,  separate  hearings  for  each  of  you.  Frankly,
I  believe  the  importance  of  science  is  such  that  we  don’t  have
enough  time  to  delve  into  the  drastic  impact  of  the  President’s  tax
cuts and the growing cost of the war and Medicaid on science. And

I think this budget is an attempt, with a lot of smoke and mirrors,
to  convince  us  that  we  have  any  credibility  in  terms  of  basic  re-
search  in  the  science  area.  And  frankly,  I  believe  that  we  do  not
have any credibility.

One of my concerns, of course, is the economy and the good work
of the MEP program and to find out that this program is being cut
in half, which says to me that there is not a serious concern about
the importance and the responsibility of the government work with
our corporate community in creating jobs.

If I might share with you briefly some numbers, and I know that
we will have an opportunity to look fully at the NASA budget forth-
coming,  but  if  we  were  to  look  at  the  NASA  budget,  let  me  just
simply  suggest  it  goes  up  a  mere  $537  million,  so  it  is  $11  billion.
I  don’t  know  if  there  is  any  opportunity  there  to  do  the  safety  re-
view and oversight that is necessary and provide the resources that
I  believe  is  necessary  for  the  safety  with  the  human  space  shuttle
as  well  as  International  Space  Station.  I  hope  to  encourage  the
leadership of this committee to have a hearing specifically on safety
and how much it will cost.

When we look at energy——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Jackson Lee, we are having a hearing

just tomorrow on NASA’s budget.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  I  am  aware  of  that.  I  won’t  pursue  that.  I

thank you so very much, Mr. Chairman.

On  the  energy  research  R&D,  you  are  going  down  $101  million,
barely  $8  billion,  when  we  have  been  very  much  in  a  discussion
about the energy dependence of the United States on international
resources.  So  obviously,  we  are  not  concerned,  from  the  R&D  per-
spective, because we have cut that down.

The  National  Science  Foundation,  a  mere  $4  billion  in  R&D,  a
$112  million  increase.  That  is  a  mere  shadow  of  what  is  needed.
In  Homeland  Security,  one  of  the  big  issues  for  this  Administra-
tion, a mere increase for federal research and R&D. One of the key
issues  of  Homeland  Security,  prevention  of  nuclear  attack,  has  to
do  with  research  R&D.  And  in  Commerce,  it  is  a  minus  $121  mil-
lion.

So I am not convinced, even with the good will of this committee
leadership,  that  we  are  doing  anything  but  touching  the  outskirts
of  a  tragedy,  and  the  tragedy  is  that  we  are  not  interested  and
committed to basic research R&D and to the sciences.

Let  me  also  mention  this,  and  I  appreciate,  Dr.  Marburger,  in
your  answers,  if  you  would  give  me  this.  One  renowned  president
of  a  renowned  Ivy  League  institution  made  a  public  statement
about  the  genetic  question  of  women  when  it  comes  to  science.  We
are hoping and praying that he has had a rebirth and understands
the  egregiousness  of  any  such  comment,  and  I  am  being  kind  by
not  calling  the  university’s  name  or  the  president’s  name  of  that
university  who  formerly  served  in  an  Administration,  in  a  Demo-
cratic Administration. And I imagine he has found his way, I hope.
But  in  that  vein,  I  am  looking  at  the  education  directorate.  The
request  totals  $104  million,  or  12  percent,  below  the  fiscal  year
2005 appropriations level. And it is continuing to decline. But more
importantly, the decrease is comprised of continuing the closeout of
the Math and Science Partnership program. It cuts the K–12 teach-

er  education  and  professional  development  program,  cuts  under-
graduate  education  programs,  and  cuts  education  research  and
evaluation programs.

How  in  the  heck,  if  you  will,  are  we  serious  about—even  with
wonderful numbers from El Paso, a great city in my state, isolated
incident that we are talking about, but we are talking about a com-
mitment to education for K–12 and also college age, and we are in
a  crisis  with  respect  to  math  and  science  scholars,  particularly
physicists and chemists, who happen to be Hispanic, African Amer-
icans,  and  others.  We  are  in  a  crisis,  as  evidenced  when  we  look
to the science institutions, including some of the ones that I know,
and of course there is no presence of minorities in those, and there
is  no  presence  when  they  come  before  our  committee.  And  no  one
comes to our committee, that happens to be a minority, that is tes-
tifying on anything of substance because we have not reached that
point yet.

So I ask humbly your answers, Dr. Marburger.
Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  gentlelady’s  time  has  expired,  but  we

will permit Dr. Marburger an opportunity to respond.

Dr. MARBURGER. Thank you.
Ms.  Jackson  Lee,  I  believe  that  there  is  more  than  one  way  to
address  the  very  serious  issues  that  you  have  raised,  and  as  Dr.
Bement has pointed it out, some of the support in areas other than
the education part of the National Science Foundation, play a very
important role in drawing young people into the sciences and math-
ematical and technical subjects. I have a feeling that there is fund-
ing  well  beyond  the  amounts  that  are  in  question  that  is  being
spent  on  this  critical  issue  elsewhere  in  the  budget,  including  in
the  Department  of  Education.  I  think  it  is  a  mistake  to  discount
the  enormous  impact  of  the  potential  and  existing  impact  of  the
Department  of  Education  on  the  improvement  of  instruction  in
math and science in our schools in the K–12 sector.

So this Administration does care about education. It does believe
that education is important. It does believe that no child should be
left  behind,  regardless  of  race  or  gender,  and  that  it  will  continue
to  explore  the  best  ways  of  accomplishing  educational  goals  and
asking  Congress  for  funds  to  support  that  and  departments  that
are appropriate to it.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  apologize  for  my  running  in  and  out  since  I  am  in  a  markup
as well. So I think I can make it through my questions before I am
called  back  there.  But  I  did  want  to  come  and  congratulate  Sec-
retary  Bodman  on  his  recent  confirmation.  I  know  that  this  is  the

cially for the Office of Science. And then also for developing the 20-
year facilities plan that cuts across the scientific disciplines, not to
mention  programs  and  offices  at  the  DOE  to  set  priorities  for  all
science.  And  I  think  this  is  no  small  feat  and  a  major  accomplish-
ment.

But  as  the  Chairman  of  the  Energy  Subcommittee,  and  as  the
Chairman  sometimes  refers  to  me  as  the  gentlelady  from  Argonne
National Laboratory, I do have a few questions.

And  I  was  disturbed  when  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  came  out
to  request  only  $4  million  for  the  continued  research  and  develop-
ment  of  the  Rare  Isotope  Accelerator,  or  RIA.  And  it  wasn’t  so
much the level of funding that surprised me but—the President re-
quested  $4  million  in  his  last  three  budgets,  and  we  have  raised
those  before,  but  what  really  dismayed  me  the  most  was  to  learn
that the DOE would not issue a final RFP or complete the site se-
lection  process,  which  would  put  both  the  members  of  Illinois  and
the members of Michigan out of our misery of what is going to hap-
pen  with  the  site.  But  Congress  certainly  has  provided  enough
funding  in  fiscal  year  2005  for  the  DOE  to  finalize  the  RFP  and
complete the site selection process.

Now  I  know  that  you  are—that  this  is—you  know,  you  are  just
here,  and  but  I  would  like  to  ask  you  if,  particularly,  and  I  notice
that  there  is  going  to  be  new  investments  in  ITER  and  the  ad-
vanced  scientific  computing.  Is  the  Department  committed  to  the
construction  of  RIA,  which  was  ranked—well,  tied  for  third  place
in  among  the  plant’s  near-term  priorities,  in  which  I  think  has
really  progressed  further  than  certainly  the  number  one  ITER,
which  is  to  be  built  out  of  this  country,  as  I  understand  it.  So  do
you  think  that  this—do  you  have  this  commitment,  or  is  it  just
gone by the wayside?

Secretary  BODMAN.  First,  I  am  pleased  to  be  here,  and  I  appre-

ciate your introductory remarks.

The assumptions that you list in your questions, you have got all
of  the  right  assumptions.  It  is,  in  fact,  tied  for  third  on  the  list  of
the outlook of a paper that was pulled together by Dr. Orbach and
his  colleagues.  Frankly,  I  view  that  $4  million  as  a  placeholder.
There  is  not  a  commitment  at  this  point  in  time.  Given  the  enor-
mity  of  the  cost,  the  potential  cost  of  the  RIA,  which  is  of  order  of
$1 billion, that as we look out and look at the various financial re-
quirements  of  running  the  science  program.  The  judgment  was
made that, even though it was ranked very highly, given the costli-
ness  of  it,  that  at  this  point  in  time,  we  can  not  say  that  we  are
committed  to  issuing  the  RFP,  causing  some  of  your  constituents
and  those  in  Michigan  and  others,  presumably,  to  go  through  the
costly exercise of responding to the RFP when we don’t have a com-
mitment  that  we  can  write  a  check  on.  And  so  that  is  the  reason
that we made that judgment at this point in time.

It is an important initiative. Intellectually, it is an important ini-
tiative, and it was one of the very difficult tradeoffs that had to be
made that Dr. Marburger referred to in arriving at this budget pro-
posal.

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, putting more money into the ITER, which at
their last hearing a year ago, Dr. Orbach said that that would cost
$700,000  and  there  would  be—$700  million,  sorry.  I  forgot  a  few
zeros  there.  There  would  be  no  cost  increase,  and  now  I  see  that
it  is  up  to  over  $1  billion,  or  $1.1  billion,  I  believe.  So  that  sur-
prises me and then saying that there is not the money for this one.
This has gone so far. I would ask, then, if this program were to be
resumed,  and  certainly  the  participants  in  competing  for  this
project  have  put  a  lot  of  money  into  this  already,  would  that  final
RFP  come  out  without  changes,  or  would  all  of  these  people  have
to start all over again? I mean, that is a hypothetical, I guess, but
it still is an important question.

Secretary BODMAN. Oh, I understand.
First  of  all,  in  terms  of  the  cost,  we  have  partners  in  the  ITER
proposal,  that  is  a  group  of  six  countries.  The  RIA  is  something
that we are going to write—we, the Federal Government, U.S. Gov-
ernment, would write a check on in its totality. So it is a very sub-
stantial amount of money. And I don’t have a very glib answer for
you, ma’am, you know, that would satisfy you. I could just tell you
that, at this point in time, we do not have a commitment to go for-
ward with it. And when we look at that and make a scientific judg-
ment of the value of that versus the other things and the amounts
of money that are required, we made the difficult choice of not sup-
porting that in this budget.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Okay.  And  I  think  that  is  about  all  I  have  to  ask,
but  just  let  me  comment.  I  think  that  we  have  worked  so  hard  on
the Office of Science and to make sure that people understand how
important  the  physical  sciences  are,  and  we  have  had  an  increase
in  the  budget  and  now  that  has  gone  down  again,  and  we  have
worked,  I  think,  so  hard  with—just  to  raise  the  consciousness  of
our  members  and  how  important  that  is,  and  I  think  that  we  are
just  seeing  that  suddenly,  you  know,  the  priority  is  going  down
again.  And  I  would  love  to  discuss  that  further  with  you  at  some
point.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  The  gentlelady’s  time  has  ex-

Mr. Miller, for the final question of the day.
Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First,  I  do  want  to  join  Chairman  Boehlert,  Mr.  Gordon,  Mr.
Matheson,  and  probably  others  in  my  support  for  the  MEP.  My
state,  North  Carolina,  has  lost  many  manufacturing  jobs.  We  are
looking  for  small  to  medium-sized  manufacturers  to  create  new
jobs, and the MEP programs are very important to them.

Mr.  Bodman,  we  had  a  hearing  last  week  on  CAFE  standards,
and I asked exactly the same question to those witnesses that Mr.
Honda asked you earlier: where is the hydrogen going to come from
for the hydrogen fuel cell? You described electrolysis as part of nu-
clear power and coal. Where does the research into those processes
stand, and how are they funded in this budget?

Secretary  BODMAN.  Those  processes  are  funded  in  this  budget.
The  FutureGen  project,  which  will  produce  hydrogen,  is  funded  in
this budget.

Mr.  MILLER.  Is  that—is  the  resourcing  to  that—and  is  that  re-

search part of the hydrogen funding, or is that separate?

Secretary  BODMAN.  No,  it  is  a  separate  line  item  for  FutureGen,
and there is a lot of interest in creating more nuclear power in this
country  and  that  initiative  is  in  the  budget.  The  2010  proposal
looks to expand the presence of nuclear power throughout the econ-
omy.  And  there  is  other  research  as  a  part  of  this  budget  in  the
nuclear area.

Mr.  MILLER.  The  witnesses  last  week  all  said  that  we  needed  to
find  a  way  to  remove—or  get  hydrogen  from  renewable  fuels,  re-
newable  sources  of  energy.  Are  you  counting  nuclear  energy  as  a
form of renewable energy?

Secretary BODMAN. No, sir.
Mr. MILLER. Okay.
Secretary BODMAN. There is also an initiative with respect to——
Mr. MILLER. Renewable.
Secretary BODMAN.—renewable, yes.
Mr. MILLER. And how is that funded?
Secretary BODMAN. That is part of the renewable energy——
Mr. MILLER. Well, that was cut, was it not?
Secretary BODMAN. It has been reduced—this component of it re-

mains an important part of it.

Mr. MILLER. All right.
In  order  to  have  a  practical  fuel  cell  supply  of  energy,  we  have
got,  first,  to  do  the  research  to  make  the  hydrogen  fuel  cells  prac-
tical,  cost  efficient,  and  then  also  do  the  research  and  accomplish
what  we  need  to  do  to  create  the  sources  of  hydrogen  available.
What  is  the  realistic  time  horizon  for  having  a  significant  fuel  cell
source of energy?

Secretary BODMAN. Fifteen or twenty years.
Mr. MILLER. Okay. You mentioned that the combination of—that
hydrogen  fuel  cells  simply  produce  water,  which  is  a  benign—you
call it a benign factor in the environment, which I agree with. But
what are the environmental effects of the various methods that are
used to generate hydrogen? Apparently the current methodology of
taking it from fossil fuels is a pretty dirty process.

Secretary BODMAN. You are correct, sir, that often, one overlooks
the environmental impact of just what it will cost to create the hy-
drogen.  And  so  one  must  be  very  conscious  of  that.  That  is  why  I
mentioned the attractiveness, relative attractiveness of nuclear en-
ergy,  the  relative  attractiveness,  you  have  raised  the  issue  of,  re-
newable  sources,  where  we  can  produce  hydrogen  without  having
any potential adverse effects on the environment.

The  general  sense  that  I  have,  sir,  is  that  the  most  difficult,  the
most  intractable  technical  problems,  the  time-consuming  problems
relate  to  the  creation  of  an  adequate  fuel  cell  electrode  that  will
produce  an  economic  source  of  energy  for  an  automobile,  number
one,  and  number  two,  the  capability  of  storing  hydrogen  on  board
the  vehicle.  Those  have  proven  to  be  very  difficult  achievements.
We  have  gradually  made  progress.  We  still  have  another  factor  of,
I think, three or four in terms of the costs that we must get to, and

143

that  means  getting  higher  electric  output  for  a  much  less  costly
electrode.  So  that  is  where  the  problem  is  going  to  be  and  not  in
getting  the  hydrogen  delivered  throughout  our  economy,  in  my
opinion.

Mr. MILLER. In the last Congress, we had hearings also on the—
well,  I  see  my  time  is  expired,  and  we  need  to  go  vote,  Mr.  Chair-
man.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And  that  ends  a  very  productive  hearing,  and  I  thank  all  of  you

for your input, for being so helpful to this committee.

I think it is very obvious to all of you that this committee is very
interested in the work you are about. We want to help provide the
resources  you  might  need.  And  contrary  to  what  some  have  sug-
gested, we are not recommending increases in everything. And con-
trary to what some others have suggested, it is not a terrible budg-
et.  It  is  a  budget  that  we  have  got  to  massage  a  little  to  improve,
and when all is said and done, we are going to work constructively
and cooperatively to do what is best for America.

Thank you very much. This hearing is adjourned.
Mr.  GORDON.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  could,  please.  Eddie  Bernice
Johnson was here earlier and would like to be able to make a cou-
ple of questions for Mr. Bodman as a part of the record.

Chairman BOEHLERT. All right. Thank you. Without objection, so

ordered.

The hearing is adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by John H. Marburger, III, President’s Science Adviser; Director, Office of

Science and Technology Policy

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. The  Administration’s  Climate  Change  Research  Initiative  is  focused  on  pro-
viding answers to important climate change research questions in the near term
(two  to  five  years).  What  is  the  rationale  for  cutting  these  activities  by  $38  mil-
lion,  or  17  percent,  while  generally  maintaining  current  funding  levels  for  the
long-term climate change research questions?

A1. The  FY  2006  Budget  requests  $181  million  for  the  Climate  Change  Research
Initiative,  a  decrease  of  $36  million  from  the  FY  2005  enacted  level.  The  decrease
is due to changes in NASA’s budget, which reflects the re-scoping of the Glory mis-
sion to focus solely on instrument development.
Q2. What  role  will  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP)  play  in  the
current  negotiations  between  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  the  National  Science
Foundation  (NSF)  over  reimbursement  for  ice-breaking  expenses  in  fiscal  year
2006 (FY06)? How will the wider value of U.S. icebreaking capability in the Ant-
arctic—such  as  enhanced  military  preparedness,  or  the  geopolitical  value  of  a
U.S presence in Antarctic waters—be factored in to these negotiations? What spe-
cific  ice-breaking-related  costs  are  NSF  and  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  each  obli-
gated by law to support? Please describe OSTP’s position and rationale on what
flexibility NSF should have to consider alternative ways to get needed ice-break-
ing capabilities at the South Pole in FY06 and future years.

A2. Cumulative  cuts  over  time  to  the  Coast  Guard’s  icebreaker  maintenance  funds
presented  a  challenge:  adequate  funding  was  not  available  to  repair  POLAR  SEA
after  Deep  Freeze  2004,  and  the  Coast  Guard  would  not  have  the  funds  if  POLAR
STAR required major repairs after Deep Freeze 2005. In response to this situation,
OSTP coordinated a series of interagency meetings during the fall of 2005 to develop
a  strategy  for  maintaining  the  icebreaking  capabilities  of  the  U.S.  Government.
These  meetings  involved  representatives  from  the  National  Science  Foundation
(NSF),  the  Coast  Guard,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
(NOAA), the U.S. Maritime Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the
Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  the  Department  of  State  (DOS),  and  the
Arctic Research Commission.

Our primary goal was to develop a recommendation that would maintain the U.S.
Government’s current icebreaking capabilities in the mid-term while allowing an or-
derly process for determining the Nation’s future needs to take place. The FY 2006
proposal for funding the Coast Guard icebreakers needs not be—and is not intended
to be—a permanent solution. Under our proposal the icebreakers will be maintained
until  a  decision  can  be  made  to  undertake  major  rebuilds  of  the  existing  vessels—
the  ‘‘service  life  extension  programs’’—or  to  replace  the  existing  vessels  with  new
icebreakers or to find alternative methods of meeting the Nation’s mission needs in
the Antarctic.

Under  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  between  NSF  and  the  Coast
Guard,  NSF  agreed  to  reimburse  the  Coast  Guard  for  its  marginal  costs  of  oper-
ation,  up  to  a  share  of  average  annual  costs.  Coast  Guard  data  from  1999  to  2004
show  that  the  defense,  enforcement  and  rescue  missions  combined  account  for  only
1.5 percent of the usage of the POLARs. During the period 1989 to 2004, these non-
research  missions  account  for  only  3.0  percent  of  the  total  usage.  In  such  a  case,
the  marginal  costs  attributable  to  NSF  come  close  to  equaling  the  full  direct  costs
of operations incurred by the Coast Guard.

OSTP will continue to coordinate a government-wide analysis of icebreaking needs
by the involved agencies. We are tasking DOD and other agencies with carrying out
analyses  of  their  peacetime  and  wartime  icebreaking  needs  in  both  the  Arctic  and
the Antarctic. We are also aware that Congress requested the National Academy of
Science  (NAS)  carry  out  a  study  of  national  icebreaking  needs.  NSF  is  also  inves-
tigating  other  options  for  supporting  the  United  States  Antarctic  Program  (USAP).
The Administration will use the results of these studies to provide an informed plan
on the most cost-effective method of simultaneously supporting both the needs of the
USAP as well as maintaining an appropriately sized U.S. icebreaker fleet.

Questions submitted by Representative Judy Biggert
Q1. Dr.  Marburger,  where  did  the  Administration  draw  the  line  in  terms  of  which
projects  should  proceed,  and  which  ones  should  be  delayed?  With  respect  to  the
Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  it  seems  like  the  budget  decisions  were  made  in
a  piecemeal  way,  on  a  project-by-project  basis,  and  were  based  not  so  much  on
the  merit  or  benefit  of  a  project,  but  rather  on  its  price  tag.  For  instance,  it
would make sense if your office or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
had  put  a  halt  to  any  project  for  which  the  Secretary  of  Energy  had  not  signed
a CD–0, or even a CD–1 (Critical Decision–0 determines mission need). However,
that does not appear to be the case. Were there standards or criteria used to de-
termine which big projects would proceed with funding, and which ones should
be postponed or delayed because funding was withheld?

A1. The  advice  and  counsel  leading  up  to  the  recommendations  which  form  the
basis of the President’s budget are part of an internal deliberative process to which
I provide input. Decisions on programs usually take into account advice from exter-
nal expert panels. With respect to large facilities, I have suggested five priority fac-
tors. These are not determinative in any specific case, but provide a general frame-
work  for  setting  priorities.  The  following  description  of  these  factors  comes  from  a
presentation I made to a committee of the National Academy of Science.
1. Facilities useful for multiple fields of science

Imaging  satellites,  supercomputers,  synchrotron  light  sources,  high  field  NMR,
ocean  research  vessels,  neutron  sources,  all  have  multiple  uses.  Computing  power,
in  particular,  has  become  an  essential  tool  for  investigating  through  simulation  all
physical phenomena described by known, highly accurate, physical laws. Higher pri-
ority should go to facilities that support a broader range of science.
2. Facilities that enable or exploit major opportunities in science

The Big-Bang mechanism of cosmic evolution turns the entire universe into a high
energy  physics  experiment.  The  ability  to  observe  manifestations  of  the  early  uni-
verse  opens  a  new  window  on  studies  of  the  smallest  scales  of  matter.  New  instru-
mentation plus powerful computing permits imaging, manipulating, and simulating
atomic  scale  processes.  This  opens  new  vistas  of  nanoscience.  Fields  of  chemistry,
physics,  and  biology  are  converging  at  the  atomic  scale. 
‘‘Genomics’’  and
‘‘proteomics’’  are  based  on  these  new  capabilities.  These  are  examples  of  unprece-
dented opportunities that deserve priority consideration.
3. Facilities whose cost and operation can reasonably be shared with other

nations
As  a  matter  of  policy,  it  makes  sense  to  share  costs  internationally  on  expensive
basic  discovery-oriented  science  facilities.  In  contrast,  other  kinds  of  big  facilities,
such as supercomputers or x-ray sources, produce new knowledge in areas of science
relevant  to  national  issues,  and  these  should  be  developed  independently  of  inter-
national collaboration. Science can be well served without duplicating hugely expen-
sive  facilities  in  different  countries.  Where  the  science  scope  is  large,  and  user  de-
mand  is  high,  duplication  can  be  justified  (e.g.,  synchrotron  light  sources,  research
reactors, satellites, ocean-going vessels, supercomputers).
4. Facilities that empower large communities of scientists

Synchrotron light sources may be the most productive of all large scientific instru-
ments, but telescopes (on Earth or in space), ocean research vessels, and some other
obviously  ‘‘shareable’’  instruments  rank  high.  New  internet-based  communication
and  control  concepts  can  make  centralized  facilities  available  to  larger  numbers  of
investigators.
5. Facilities that address major national priorities

Biological  containment  facilities,  observation  systems  for  weather  and  climate,
supercomputers for intelligence analysis, and facilities for nuclear weapons stockpile
stewardship  are  required  to  carry  out  major  functions  of  government.  The  priority
accorded to such a function transfers to the facilities that support it.
Q2. Since  remaining  at  the  forefront  of  research  in  the  physical  sciences  is  going  to
require  new  investments  beyond  the  International  Thermonuclear  Experimental
Reactor and Advanced Scientific Computing at DOE, is the Administration com-
mitted  to  the  implementation  of  the  20-year,  Facilities  for  the  Future  of  Science
plan  developed  by  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  and  publicly  touted  by  former  En-
ergy Secretary Abraham?

A2. The  Administration  encourages  the  development  of  strategic  planning  docu-
ments,  such  as  the  20-year  Facilities  Plan,  which  help  to  inform  the  White  House
Offices,  including  my  office  and  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  as  well  as
Congress,  about  the  opportunities  and  the  strategic  plans  of  the  Agency.  The  20-
year  Facilities  Plan  represents  a  good  example  of  the  articulation  of  priorities  for
future investments in large scientific facilities. Other agencies are encouraged to un-
dertake  similar  prioritization  exercises.  However,  the  20-year  Facilities  Plan  is  a
Department  of  Energy  planning  document  and  not  a  statement  of  Administration
position.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Since  March  2004,  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)
has been without a full time director. Although Dr. Hratch Semerjian has done
an  outstanding  job  as  Acting  Director,  the  fact  remains  that  NIST  has  been
without a full-time Director for almost a year. When does the Administration in-
tend to nominate a new NIST Director?

A1. The  position  of  Director,  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  has
been vacant since November 24, 2004, when Dr. Bement was sworn in as the Direc-
tor  of  the  National  Science  Foundation.  The  Administration  has  been  working  ac-
tively since that time to identify and nominate a candidate for this position and will
announce a nomination as soon as the process is complete.
Q2. Since  2001,  we  have  lost  2.8  million  manufacturing  jobs.  This  past  December
alone we lost another 25,000. The Administration’s FY 2004 Manufacturing Ex-
tension Program (MEP) Impacts Report says that MEP increased sales by $4 bil-
lion  and  created  over  50,000  jobs.  (These  numbers  reflect  results  from  just  @  of
the recipients, so they are very conservative.)

Q2a. What  other  federal  program  produces  the  kind  of  return  on  investment  that

MEP has demonstrated?

A2a. The estimated return on the Federal Government’s investment in R&D varies
widely. It is clear, however, that this investment has had—and continues to have—
a  tremendous  impact  on  the  Nation’s  economy.  The  programs  through  which  these
investments  are  made  are  spread  across  numerous  departments  and  agencies,  in-
cluding NIST. According to NIST, between three percent and six percent of the U.S.
gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  attributed  to  measurements  and  measurement-re-
lated  operations  that  rely  on  NIST  for  accuracy,  reliability,  and  international  rec-
ognition.  Based  on  the  2004  GDP  of  $11.6  trillion,  that  equates  to  a  range  of  ap-
proximately  $350  billion  to  $700  billion  worth  of  U.S.  goods  and  services.  Because
of the tremendous impact on the economy of NIST’s R&D programs, the Administra-
tion continues to place a high priority on the NIST core laboratory programs.
Q2b. Given  the  performance  of  MEP  and  the  economic  situation  in  manufacturing,
why  hasn’t  the  Administration  brought  forward  a  budget  proposing  to  expand
MEP?

A2b. The Administration’s highest priority for NIST is the laboratory research pro-
grams,  which  produce  the  scientific  foundation  for  new  technologies  and  support
measurement  and  standards  activities  that  help  enable  the  development  and  com-
mercialization  of  new  and  emerging  technologies.  Through  these  programs,  NIST
provides  the  infrastructure  necessary  to  promote  innovation  and  enhance  the  pro-
ductivity and competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.
Q2c. How  many  MEP  centers  will  end  up  being  closed  under  this  proposal  and

where are they located?

A2c. The  FY  2006  Budget  does  not  target  any  centers  for  closure.  NIST  is  in  the
process  of  defining  the  criteria  and  the  process  by  which  evaluation  of  centers  will
be conducted.
Q2d. The FY03 and FY04 requests for MEP were both $13 million; the FY05 request
was $39 million; now we get $46.8 million. Can you explain the process where-
by the Administration determines the proper funding level for MEP?

A2d. The  Fiscal  Year  2006  Budget  request  proposes  to  fund  MEP  at  $46.8  million,
50  percent  of  the  FY  2005  grant  level.  This  level  will  enable  NIST  to  maintain  its
focus on improving the productivity, economic competitiveness, and technological ca-
pability of U.S. manufacturers, particularly small manufacturers, through MEP cen-
ters. At the same time, the Budget will provide the NIST laboratories with the fund-
ing  levels  necessary  to  ensure  the  scientific  foundation  for  new  technologies  and

149

maintain support for standards activities that are key to the development and com-
mercialization of new and emerging technologies.
Q3. The Administration has asked to have the Math and Science Partnership trans-
ferred to the Department of Education, which has no history of working to forge
links between schools and university faculties as called for in the program. You
have  also  sought  a  35  percent  cut  to  the  K–12  teacher  training  program—this
amounts  to  cutting  the  training  program  in  half  over  the  last  two  budgets.1
Meanwhile,  our  students  score  badly  in  international  science  and  math  tests,
and  we  know  that  82  percent  of  middle  school  students  and  46  percent  of  high
school students have someone teaching them physical sciences who is not consid-
ered qualified to teach.

Q3a. Do  you  have  evidence  that  either  the  Math  and  Science  Partnership  or  the  K–
12  teacher  training  program  at  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  was
failing or mismanaged?

A3a. The  consolidation  of  the  Math  and  Science  Partnership  (MSP)  at  the  Depart-
ment  of  Education  reflects  a  desire  to  focus  the  program  on  integrating  evidence-
based  practices  into  classroom  settings  and  on  implementing  research  findings  al-
ready  incurred.  NSF  continues  to  support  current  MSP  awards  (for  $60  million  in
2006),  but  otherwise  NSF  is  focusing  K–12  investments  on  supporting  cutting-edge
educational science programs.

While  NSF  is  preeminent  in  forging  relationships  between  research  and  practice,
the  Department  of  Education’s  MSP  program  has  a  statutory  requirement  for  de-
partments of engineering, mathematics or sciences to partner with State or local in-
stitutions of higher education in using MSP formula funding.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  Administration  still  favors  competition  for  this  pro-
gram. The FY 2006 request for MSP at the Department of Education of $269 million
(a  51  percent  increase  over  FY  2005),  includes  $120  million  for  competitive  grants
to improve math education for low achieving secondary school students.
Q3b. Is  there  a  single  improvement  that  you  are  aware  of  that  would  have  a  larger
impact  on  student  achievement  than  having  well  qualified  teachers  in  every
classroom?

A3b. Increasing student achievement is a very complex endeavor that requires R&D
in  numerous  domains.  The  availability  of  well-qualified  teachers  is  clearly  very  im-
portant.  The  President’s  Department  of  Education  budget  includes  $2.92  billion  for
Improving  Teacher  Quality  State  Grants  to  help  states  ensure  that  all  teachers  of
core academic subjects are highly qualified, as required by the No Child Left Behind
Act  of  2002.  The  budget  also  includes  $500  million  for  a  new  Teacher  Incentive
Fund,  which  would  provide  formula  grants  to  reward  effective  teachers  and  create
incentives  to  attract  qualified  teachers  to  high-need  schools.  The  new  Adjunct
Teacher Corps Initiative will provide $40 million in support of drawing on the skills
of well-qualified individuals outside the public education system to meet specialized
teaching  needs  in  secondary  schools.  In  addition,  the  President  has  proposed  to  ex-
tend the Education Department’s new teacher loan forgiveness program, enacted for
one  year  as  part  of  the  Taxpayer-Teacher  Protection  Act  of  2004,  that  will  provide
up to $17,500 in student loan forgiveness to highly qualified math, science, and spe-
cial education teachers serving low-income communities.
Q3c. Is NSF abandoning its historic role in teacher training and professional devel-
opment?  If  not,  why  are  teachers  and  their  preparation  becoming  such  a  low
priority at NSF?

A3c. Education  and  workforce  development  continue  to  be  integral  to  the  mission
of the NSF. NSF continually considers new education programs that will create the
best ways for broadening opportunities and participation—including an emphasis on
minority-serving  institutions  and  community  colleges,  to  link  these  up  with  major
research  universities.  The  FY  2006  Budget  will  continue  NSF’s  efforts  to  prepare
U.S.  students  to  enter  the  science  and  engineering  workforce,  with  funds  for  4,600
graduate  research  fellowships  and  traineeships.  The  Graduate  Teaching  Fellows  in
the  K–12  Education  program,  which  supports  fellowships  that  put  graduate  stu-
dents in NSF-supported Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)

1 This  figure  comes  from  (presumably)  the  34.9  percent  reduction  (over  FY05)  to  the  Teacher
Development  Program  in  Elementary,  Secondary  and  Informal  Education  Division  at  the  NSF.
(ESIE was cut 22.6 percent.) Funds for Teacher Professional Continuum were reduced by 45 per-
cent.  The  program  will  focus  on  elementary  science  in  FY06.  In  FY04,  TPC  received  198  pro-
posals  and  funded  14  percent.  In  FY06,  30  new  awards  will  be  funded.  Request  is  $33M,  down
$27.2M from FY05 Current Plan.

disciplines  in  K–12  classrooms,  improves  teaching  and  communication  skills  while
enriching  STEM  instruction  in  these  schools.  With  an  increase  of  $100,000,  and
with support from other NSF Directorates, the program will support approximately
935 graduate fellows in FY 2006.
Q4. A  subcommittee  of  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology  (PCAST)  is  reviewing  the  federal  support  for  basic,  non-classified  cyber
security research. A preview of the report’s findings presented at a PCAST meet-
ing  last  month  included  a  concern  that  such  funding  is  inadequate.  The  report
will  call  for  substantial  increases  in  basic  cyber  security  research  at  NSF,  the
Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  the  Defense  Advanced  Research
Projects Agency (DARPA).

Q4a. Is  cyber  security  research  an  area  that  receives  emphasis  in  the  annual  guid-

ance OSTP gives to the agencies on national R&D needs?

A4a. While  not  specifically  called  out  in  the  guidance  provided  by  the  joint  OSTP/
OMB memo that defines Administration S&T priorities, cyber security is an impor-
tant  component  of  the  interagency  Networking  and  Information  Technology  R&D
(NITRD)  Program,  which  is  highlighted  in  the  joint  priorities  memo  to  agencies.
Current  cyber  security  R&D  activities  of  NITRD  agencies  are  reported  primarily  in
the High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) and the Large Scale Networking
(LSN) components of the NITRD Program. The NITRD Program is currently consid-
ering  reporting  the  cyber  security  R&D  activities  under  a  new  Cyber  Security  com-
ponent of the Program.
Q4b. Are  you  satisfied  that  the  funding  requests  for  NSF,  DARPA  and  DHS  for  FY

2006 will provide adequate resources for this purpose?

A4b. The  FY  2006  budget  requests  for  NSF,  DARPA  and  DHS  are  the  result  of
careful  prioritization  of  agency  missions  and  responsibilities.  The  NSF  expects  to
spend  $80  million  on  cyber  security  R&D  in  FY  2006,  which  will  support  research
grants on long-term fundamental cyber security research and cyber security-related
education  and  training.  DARPA’s  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $84  million  in  cyber
security  R&D  is  targeted  at  developing  cyber  security  technologies  that  benefit  the
military,  particularly  important  in  a  network-enabled  war  fighting  context.  DHS’s
FY 2006 budget request of $20 million ($17 million after deductions for salary allo-
cations)  for  cyber  security  R&D  is  formulated  based  on  a  formal  strategic  planning
process  that  takes  into  consideration  risks,  threats,  and  vulnerabilities.  These  and
other  agency  cyber  security  activities  are  consistent  with  agency  missions  and  pro-
vide a complementary approach to cyber security R&D.
Q4c. The  PCAST  subcommittee  also  found  that  the  federal  research  effort  in  cyber
security is unfocused and inefficient due to poor coordination and oversight. Do
you  agree  with  this  finding,  and  do  you  believe  cyber  security  R&D  should  re-
ceive greater attention in the planning and coordination of the interagency Na-
tional Information Technology R&D program?

A4c. The  finding  by  the  President’s  Information  Technology  Advisory  Committee
(PITAC) regarding the coordination and oversight of cyber security R&D did not re-
flect  the  efforts  of  the  Critical  Information  Infrastructure  Protection  interagency
working  group  (CIIP  IWG),  which  first  met  in  November  2003  and  has  become  in-
creasingly  active  since  then.  This  active  coordinating  body  representing  the  cyber
security  R&D  efforts  of  over  20  organizations  from  a  dozen  departments  and  agen-
cies  holds  monthly  coordination  meetings,  and  is  currently  completing  an  inter-
agency  cyber  security  R&D  plan.  PITAC’s  recommendation  that  the  coordination  of
cyber  security  R&D  should  be  conducted  under  the  Networking  and  Information
Technology R&D (NITRD) Program is currently being implemented.
Q5. The  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  established  an  Education  Re-
search  Task  Group  to  review  current  federal  education  research  activities  and
to make recommendations for strengthening the federal research portfolio.

Q5a. What  has  this  Task  Group  accomplished  thus  far  and  are  any  recommenda-

tions of the Task Group incorporated in the FY 2006 budget request?

A5a. The  National  Science  and  Technology  Council,  Committee  on  Science,  Sub-
committee  on  Education  and  Workforce  Development  has  established  an  Education
Research  Task  Group.  The  objectives  of  the  Task  Group  are  to:  a)  review  and  ap-
praise the depth and content of the current federal investment in research on learn-
ing  and  education  in  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and  Mathematics  (STEM)
and  in  evaluation  research,  K–20;  and  b)  provide  recommendations  for  strength-
ening the federal research portfolio.

151

The  reports  and  recommendations  of  the  Task  Group  will  be  submitted  to  the
Subcommittee  on  Education  and  Workforce  Development  and  to  the  Committee  on
Science  for  review.  To  date,  no  recommendations  or  findings  have  been  forwarded
to the Committees or incorporated in the FY 2006 budget request.

The  Task  Group  reports  that  it  has  identified  the  major  federal  agencies  that  in-
vest  in  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and  Mathematics  (STEM)  education  and
evaluation research. Using published solicitations and program announcements, the
task group reports that it is nearing completion of the following:

1) a  database  that  characterizes  the  STEM  education  research  programs  and
portfolios  of  these  agencies  by  indicating  how  much  was  invested  in  each  of
these research areas for each program in FY 2003;

2) a grid in which we list the general priorities and objectives that guided these

investments;

3) a  table  spelling  out  in  detail  the  specific  priorities  and  objectives  for  every
relevant program in each of the major agencies funding STEM education re-
search;

4) a description by each federal agency regarding the various types of research
designs,  methods,  and  data-analytic  strategies  that  are  considered  to  be  ac-
ceptable  and/or  of  particular  interest  with  respect  to  the  conduct  of  STEM
education research projects;

5) a  bibliography  of  60+  STEM  education  reports  issued  by  the  National  Re-
search  Council,  the  National  Science  Board,  or  other  organizations  during
the past 5–7 years; and

6) a list of recommendations emanating from the above-mentioned reports that
pertain  to  research-related  issues.  The  working  group  reports  that  it  is  cur-
rently  working  on  a  mapping  of  these  recommendations  onto  the  priorities
and  objectives  of  all  research  programs,  in  order  to  extract  issues  and  con-
cerns  raised  in  these  reports  that  may  still  require  additional  study  by  the
research community.

Based on this information, the Task Group will then develop a list of suggestions
and  recommendations  regarding:  1)  how  the  federal  agencies  might  work  together
to cover gaps and areas of significant under-funding in the current STEM education
and evaluation research portfolio, 2) steps that can be taken to interest investigators
who  study  other  societal  issues  to  undertake  research  on  education;  and  3)  strate-
gies  for  attracting  students  to  the  STEM  education  and  evaluation  research  fields.
A report to include the databases and recommendations will then be produced and
vetted through the respective federal agencies and the Education and Workforce De-
velopment  Subcommittee  prior  to  public  release.  The  draft  report  is  anticipated  by
June 2005.
Q5b. What  is  the  level  of  federal  funding  for  education  research  across  agencies  in

this year’s budget and how does it compare to the previous year?

A5b. No  crosscut  budget  analysis  for  education  research  in  the  FY  2006  Budget  is
available at this time.

The  Task  Group’s  charge  is  to  look  across  federal  agencies  and  examine  the  pro-
grams  that  include  a  STEM  education  research  component.  The  Task  Group  took
a ‘‘snapshot’’ of the investments in STEM Education Research for FY 2003 only (the
year  the  Task  Group  began).  Preliminary  summary  data  of  each  agency’s  budget
evaluated  by  the  Task  Group  indicate  that  NSF  funded  nearly  $140  million  in
STEM  education  research  studies,  the  Department  of  Education  funded  over  $28
million  (though  much  of  this  funding  wasn’t  specifically  allocated  to  STEM  issues),
and  The  National  Institutes  of  Health  (National  Institute  of  Child  Health  and
Human Development, NICHD) funded nearly $6 million.

However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  2006  Budget  includes  $479  million  for  the
Department  of  Education’s  Institute  of  Education  Sciences.  The  Institute  invests
some of these funds in new research programs, including focused programs to iden-
tify  effective  approaches  to  mathematics  and  science  education,  to  understand  how
to enhance children’s reading comprehension and to intervene with struggling read-
ers, to identify which preschool programs best prepare children to learn to read and
do mathematics, and to determine how to improve the preparation and professional
development  of  teachers  of  reading  and  mathematics.  In  addition,  the  Institute
launched  a  major  program  to  fund  university-based  interdisciplinary  training  pro-
grams  in  the  education  sciences  to  train  a  new  generation  of  scientists  who  are  ca-
pable of linking rigorous research to the needs of education decision-makers.

It  is  important  also  to  note  that  education  research  activities  are  supported
throughout the NSF, not only in the Education and Human Resources (EHR) Direc-

torate. The Science of Learning Centers, funded within Research and Related Activi-
ties (R&RA) at $23 million, (a $3.16 million increase), support multi-disciplinary re-
search to advance fundamental knowledge in the science of learning. NSF continues
to support its Science and Technology Centers with an increase of $2 million to sup-
port two Centers initiated in FY 2005—these Centers foster partnerships that build
collaborative  culture  among  researchers  and  education,  and  create  team  environ-
ments for learning and research.

The  NICHD  supports  research  relevant  to  education  via  its  Early  Learning  and
School  Readiness  Program,  which  focuses  on  research  that  attempts  to  specify  the
experiences  children  need  from  birth  to  age  eight  to  prepare  them  to  learn,  read,
and  succeed  in  school.  The  NICHD  research  program  in  learning  disabilities  and
reading disorders is now entering its 39th year; the program has increased from one
to  44  research  sites,  and  findings  obtained  from  these  sites  now  serve  as  the  sci-
entific  basis  for  evidence-based  reading  practices  and  policies  in  the  United  States.
In  2002,  the  NICHD  established  its  mathematics  and  science  learning  program
to improve understanding of normal and atypical development of mathematical and
scientific  thinking  and  learning.  In  FY  2005,  the  NICHD,  in  collaboration  with  the
Administration  for  Children  and  Families  (U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services) and the Office and Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (U.S. De-
partment of Education) supported the development of tools to measure school readi-
ness  outcomes  for  young  children.  This  initiative  was  directed  at  providing  appro-
priate  measures  for  linguistically  and  culturally  diverse  populations  of  young  chil-
dren as well as those with disabilities.
Q5c. What is the relationship between the National Science and Technology Council
review  and  the  proposed  cut  of  42  percent  to  education  research  in  NSF’s  edu-
cation directorate?2

A5c. The Education Research Task Group has not yet made recommendations to its
parent  subcommittees  (Subcommittee  on  Education  and  Workforce  Development)  of
the  NSTC,  so  the  work  of  the  Task  Group  did  not  play  a  role  in  funding  decisions
for NSF’s education directorate.
Q5d. Why  is  the  Interagency  Education  Research  Initiative  involving  NSF,  the  Na-
tional Institutes of Health and the Department of Education being phased out,
and  again  is  this  an  outcome  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council
review?

A5d. As  I  explained  earlier,  the  Education  Research  Task  Group  has  not  yet  made
recommendations  to  its  parent  subcommittees  (Subcommittee  on  Education  and
Workforce  Development)  of  the  NSTC,  so  the  work  of  the  Task  Group  did  not  play
a  role  in  decisions  regarding  the  Interagency  Education  Research  initiative  (IERI).
The  Department  of  Education  reports  that  the  Interagency  Education  Research
Initiative  not  been  ‘‘phased  out.’’  The  participating  agencies  decided  that  it  would
be better to support the scale-up projects that were the focus of IERI through their
own agency’s competitive procedures.

In  FY  2003,  the  Institute  of  Education  Sciences  (IES)  funded  its  own  IERI
projects pursuant to a competition specifically and solely for IERI projects that was
managed on behalf of NSF, NICHD and the Department of Education. This was the
last  competition  dedicated  exclusively  to  IERI  projects.  However,  in  FY  2004,  IES
invited applicants under their reading comprehension, math and science, and teach-
er  quality  research  competitions  to  submit  applications  that  addressed  the  IERI
goal.  Those  competitions  included  other  research  goals  that  could  be  addressed  by
applicants  as  well.  Some  of  the  awards  made  in  FY  2004  and  FY  2005  addressed
the IERI goal, and similar opportunities will be available in FY 2006. Both NSF and
NIH continue to provide research support in these areas.

The NSF portion of IERI held its own competitions in FY 2003 and FY 2004 (with
a  final  competition  expected  in  2005),  because  NSF  believes  that  more  projects  are
needed  that  focus  specifically  on  mathematics  and  science.  In  addition,  NSF’s  Re-
search on Learning and Education (ROLE) program supports fundamental research
on teaching and learning.
Q6. The Federal Oceanographic Facilities Committee’s December 2001 report forecast
the  need  for  the  addition  of  ten  new  ships  over  a  20-year  period  to  the  aging
academic research fleet in order to maintain the current fleet capacity. Little has
been  done  to  put  in  place  a  plan  for  ship  replacement,  while  we  have  seen
growth  in  the  need  for  ship  time  to  support  ocean  observatories  and  to  deploy

and service the tsunamis alert system. Is this matter on the OSTP radar screen,
and  if  so,  how  is  it  being  addressed  in  the  FY  2006  budget  request?  Is  OSTP
involved in any effort to develop a long-term plan for research ship replacement?
A6. The federal oceanographic fleet renewal activity includes: a global-class seismic
research ship in FY 2006; four ocean-class fishing survey vessels, with one built and
operational in FY 2005, two under construction, and one proposed for funding; four
ocean-class  ships  planned;  and,  three  regional-class  ships  planned.  OSTP,  through
its  participation  in  the  National  Oceanographic  Partnership  Program  and  through
the  President’s  Ocean  Action  Plan  (OAP),  is  cognizant  of  the  aging  oceanographic
research fleet. OSTP, through its leadership of the National Science and Technology
Council and of OAP, is preparing an ocean research priorities plan and implementa-
tion  strategy,  which  will  be  completed  on  December  31,  2006,  and  which  will  state
the Nation’s vision for the oceans.

Responses  by  Samuel  W.  Bodman,  Secretary  of  Energy,  U.S.  Department  of  Energy

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Your  budget  request  proposes  to  phase  out  funding  for  oil  and  gas  technology
research  and  development  (R&D),  stating  that  ‘‘Budget  discipline  necessitated
close scrutiny of all Fossil Energy programs, using strict guidelines to determine
their  effectiveness  and  compare  them  to  other  programs  offering  more  clearly
demonstrated  and  substantial  benefits.’’  What  guidelines  did  the  Department  of
Energy  (DOE)  use  to  evaluate  program  effectiveness,  and  why  did  these  pro-
grams fare poorly? Can the oil and gas industries support this research on their
own?

A1. The  Administration’s  decision  to  terminate  the  oil  and  gas  research  programs
reflects a strategic assessment of the program compared to other Fossil Energy pro-
grams.  The  assessment  relied  on  guidelines  to  evaluate  the  oil  and  gas  programs’
effectiveness,  efficiency  and  technical  viability.  Much  of  the  Department’s  oil  and
natural gas research is jointly funded by industry and the government. In this case
it was determined that the industry has the capacity to pursue this research, espe-
cially  in  light  of  the  current  strong  economic  performance  of  the  industry.  This  is
in line with our commitment to deliver results for the American taxpayer.
Q2. According to the National Academy of Sciences, significant reductions in oil use
from  a  transition  to  hydrogen  are  at  least  one  or  two  decades  away.  How  does
your budget proposal treat R&D efforts that more focused on near-terms results,
such  as  research  on  lightweight,  high-strength  automotive  materials,  hybrid  ve-
hicles  and  advanced  diesels?  How  can  DOE  do  a  better  job  of  encouraging  the
adoption of these energy-saving technologies into the marketplace?

A2. The Department strongly supports nearer-term and mid-term approaches to re-
ducing  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.  In  fact,  almost  all  of  the  proposed  FY  2006
activities  in  our  Vehicle  Technologies  Program  contribute  to  nearer-term  and  mid-
term solutions, including $48.8 million for hybrid and electric propulsion, $41.1 mil-
lion for advanced combustion engines (including diesels), $38.2 million for advanced
materials  technologies,  $13.6  million  for  advanced  fuels  development,  $13.8  million
for vehicle systems, and $5.0 million to support alternative fuel use in fleets.

The Vehicle Technologies Program works through two major government-industry
partnerships,  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  and  the  21st  Century  Truck
Partnership. Partnering with industry creates a common understanding of technical
capabilities  and  barriers,  which  increases  the  likelihood  that  industry  will  pick  up
DOE’s energy-saving technologies. The Vehicle Technologies Program undertakes ef-
forts  to  encourage  the  use  of  alternative  fuel  vehicles  and  alternative  fuels  in  fed-
eral,  State,  local  and  provider  fleets.  DOE  also  provides  extensive  information  for
consumers  and  fleet  owners  on  already  commercialized  energy  efficient  transpor-
tation

ITER
Q3. In last year’s budget hearing, the Administration witness assured the committee
that  the  U.S.  share  of  ITER,  the  international  fusion  project,  would  not  exceed
$700  million  dollars.  This  year’s  Congressional  Budget  request  puts  the  U.S.
share  at  over  $1.1  billion  dollars.  Has  the  Administration  withdrawn  its  com-
mitment? If not, please explain the discrepancy.

A3. The  Administration’s  commitment  to  ITER  remains  strong.  The  $700  million
figure  to  which  you  refer  was  a  very  preliminary  figure  derived  from  an  estimate
prepared by the ITER Parties in July 2001 when the U.S. was not involved in ITER.
Their estimate was $5 billion for the total project construction in constant 2002 dol-
lars, so a U.S. 10 percent share would be $500 million. To this $500 million number,
DOE added contingency and escalation to reach approximately the $700 million fig-
ure.  However,  based  upon  continuing  U.S.  participation  in  the  ITER  negotiations,
it has become clear that other elements of a typical DOE project cost estimate, such
as  U.S.  industrial  input,  project  management  of  U.S.  procurements,  exchange  rate
effects  for  personnel  sent  abroad,  and  additional  R&D  and  design  needed  to  be  in-
cluded. These items have been included in the FY 2006 President’s budget. The de-
tailed  current  understanding  of  the  ITER  ‘‘construction’’  costs  are  summarized  in
the President’s FY 2006 budget proposal, namely:

The current estimated cost for the U.S. Contributions to ITER project begins with
the  nominal  $502  million  dollar  value  estimate  from  the  international  estimate  in
the  Final  Design  Report  of  2001.  Since  then,  as  is  customary  for  DOE  Major  Items
of  Equipment  projects,  we  added  1)  $95  million  reflecting  the  actual  cost  of  pro-
ducing  in  U.S.  industry  the  components  included  in  our  10  percent  portion  of  the
facility,  2)  $35  million  to  the  personnel  costs  reflecting  our  experience  in  the  pre-
vious  ITER  Engineering  Design  Activities,  and  3)  $103  million  for  project  and  pro-
curement management. With this base cost for the components, personnel and cash
contributions,  we  needed  to  add  $120  million  to  cover  contingency,  $183  million  to
account  for  escalation  over  the  years  of  the  project,  and  $84  million  to  provide  for
remaining design and R&D incorporated into the Total Project Cost. With these ad-
ditions,  the  nominal  $502  million  value  becomes,  in  the  DOE  project  management
costing system, a total of $1.122 billion.

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  FY  2006  President’s  Budget  also  says  that
this  Total  Project  Cost  of  $1.122  billion  is  a  preliminary  estimate  that  may  well
change  (due  to  changes  in  OMB’s  outyear  inflation  estimates  and/or  currency  ex-
change  rates)  by  the  time  the  project  receives  its  formal  performance  baseline
(known  in  Critical  Decision–2  in  the  parlance  of  DOE  project  management)  fol-
lowing the signing of a final multilateral agreement.
Q4. What,  in  your  view,  is  the  most  effective  strategy  for  the  Department  to  bridge
the  remaining  gap  from  the  laboratory  to  the  commercial  grid  in  the  area  of
high temperature superconductivity? What can be done to ensure there are dem-
onstrations  of  complete,  integrated  systems  based  on  superconducting  tech-
nology?

A4. The FY 2006 Budget request supports two parallel paths in order to bridge this
gap.  We  are  continuing  research  that  improves  the  performance  and  potential  cost
of  future  high  temperature  superconductivity  grid  equipment.  At  the  same  time,  in
partnership  with  electric  utilities  and  equipment  manufacturers,  we  are  supporting
demonstrations of first-of-a-kind equipment prototypes in operation on the grid. The
time  to  market  will  be  accelerated  by  this  approach  which  provides  utilities  direct
experience with installation and operation of superconducting equipment as well as
gaining  the  advantages  of  their  collaboration  in  designing  equipment  which  will
meet  their  needs  and  requirements.  For  example,  three  complete,  integrated  sys-
tems that demonstrate different aspects of superconducting cables are now being de-
veloped in partnership with American Electric Power, Long Island Power Authority
and  National  Grid  (Niagara  Mohawk)  for  planned  operation  and  testing  on  electric
grids in Ohio and New York.

RIA Project
Q1. The  other  projects  ahead  of  or  tied  with  the  proposed  Rare  Isotope  Accelerator
(RIA)  on  the  20-year  facilities  plan  would  cost  the  U.S.  Government  less  than
RIA  (with  the  possible  exception  of  ITER  which  was  supposed  to  cost  less,  but
which the FY06 budget says will cost more). That being the case, did DOE sus-
pend the final request for proposals and delay indefinitely the site selection proc-
ess  for  RIA  only  because  of  money—namely  the  total  project  cost  and  a  lack  of
funding  in  the  FY06  budget  and  in  the  outyears?  Or  were  there  other  consider-
ations, and if so, what were they? Is there no room in the budget for RIA because
ITER has become a billion dollar project?

A1. Before proceeding with a project like RIA that requires a significant investment
by  the  U.S.  Government,  the  funding  to  construct  and  operate  the  proposed  facility
needs  to  be  identified  and  the  decision  to  proceed  must  be  made  in  the  context  of
other  departmental  and  national  needs  and  priorities.  Under  the  FY  2006  request,
necessary research and development work will continue on the RIA project.

The  ITER  project  has  been  identified  by  the  President  as  an  Administration  pri-
ority  and  funding  is  requested  in  FY  2006  to  start  this  project.  The  detailed  esti-
mate  of  the  ITER  ‘‘construction’’  costs  (in  full  DOE  project  management  accounting
terms)  are  summarized  in  the  President’s  FY  2006  Budget.  The  total  project  cost
includes  all  costs  associated  with  a  Major  Item  of  Equipment  project,  namely,  fab-
rication of components, personnel and cash contributions to the ITER Organization,
contingency,  escalation,  project  and  procurement  management,  and  remaining  de-
sign and R&D.

Office of Science Projects
Q2. Where  did  the  Administration  draw  the  line  in  terms  of  which  projects  should
proceed,  and  which  ones  should  be  delayed?  With  respect  to  DOE,  it  seems  like
the budget decisions were made in a piecemeal way, on a project-by-project basis,
and  were  based  not  so  much  on  the  merit  or  benefit  of  a  project,  but  rather  on
its  price  tag.  For  instance,  it  would  make  sense  if  your  office  or  the  Office  of
Management and Budget (OMB) had put a halt to any project for which the Sec-
retary  of  Energy  had  not  signed  a  CD–0,  or  even  a  CD–1  (Critical  Decision–0
determines  mission  need).  However,  that  does  not  appear  to  be  the  case.  Were
there  standards  or  criteria  used  to  determine  which  big  projects  would  proceed
with  funding,  and  which  ones  should  be  postponed  or  delayed  because  funding
was withheld?

A2. For  all  Office  of  Science  projects,  the  budget  decisions  were  guided  by  our  Fa-
cilities  Outlook,  ‘‘Facilities  for  the  Future  of  Science:  A  Twenty  Year  Outlook.’’  In
our  FY  2006  request,  the  top  priority  in  the  Facilities  Outlook,  ITER,  is  funded  as
U.S.  contributions  to  this  international  project  begin.  The  next  priority,  the
Ultrascale  Scientific  Computing  Capability,  or  Next  Generation  Architecture,  was
funded in FY 2005 and continues in FY 2006. One of the projects tied for third place
in the facilities outlook, the Linac Coherent Light Source, continues design funding
started  in  FY  2005  and  also  begins  physical  construction  funding  in  FY  2006.  Of
the remaining priorities only the Transmission Electronic Achromatic Microscope, a
relatively small project with a total project cost range of $25,000,000 to $30,000,000
is funded in our FY 2006 request beyond the R&D stage.

All  Office  of  Science  projects  included  in  the  FY  2006  request  to  Congress  have
CD–0  approval  except  ITER.  CD–1,  approval  of  preliminary  baseline  range,  is  re-
quired  before  funding  appropriated  for  a  project  can  be  used,  but  not  before  the
funding request is made.

Volpentest HAMMER Training and Education Center
Q1. I was recently briefed on the Volpentest HAMMER Training and Education Cen-
ter in Richland, WA, which provides hands-on ‘‘Training as Real as It Gets’’ that
is  keeping  Hanford  cleanup  workers  safe  and  healthy,  and  is  helping  fire,  law
enforcement,  customs,  border  protection,  security,  emergency  medical,  and  other
emergency  response  personnel  prepare  for  the  many  hazards  they  face  daily  in
protecting  the  homeland.  Also,  HAMMER  is  helping  the  Pacific  Northwest  Na-
tional  Laboratory  field  test  and  deploy  new  technologies  to  keep  workers  safe
and healthy, and the homeland secure.
Will DOE coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security and other gov-
ernmental  agencies  to  develop  a  strategy  and  a  cooperative  agreement  to  ensure
that the Volpentest HAMMER Training and Education Center in Richland, WA,
remains available to meet the training needs of Hanford cleanup workers, emer-
gency responders, and law enforcement, customs, border protection, and security
personnel, along with serving as a test bed to deploy new field technologies?

A1. Yes,  DOE  will  cooperate  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  to
develop a strategy and a cooperative agreement to ensure that the Volpentest Haz-
ardous  Materials  Management  and  Emergency  Response  Training  Center  (HAM-
MER)  remains  available  to  meet  DHS’s  growing  training  needs,  along  with  serving
as a test bed to deploy new field technologies. DOE supports the expansion of HAM-
MER customer base. Hanford site workers continue to take advantage of this asset,
and  the  training  they  are  receiving  is  helping  to  ensure  work  is  conducted  safely
and protective of their health and the environment. We also continue to support the
transition  of  HAMMER  to  future  program  sponsors.  We  want  to  ensure  that  HAM-
MER,  as  a  national  asset,  continues  to  serve  this  country’s  needs  now  and  in  the
future, beyond the Hanford clean-up mission.

Question submitted by Representative Michael E. Sodrel
Q1. As  the  United  States  invests  in  energy  research  and  development,  does  the  De-
partment  have  in  place  programs  to  assist  firms  in  preventing  the  exploration
of this research through industrial espionage or other means?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00160 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

157

A1. The Department’s Office of Counterintelligence (OCI) supports a number of pro-
grams that are designed to identify, deter and neutralize attempts by foreign powers
and their agents to steal classified, proprietary, and other sensitive information and
technology related to energy research and development.

One primary OCI effort to address this concern is through a very strong counter-
intelligence (CI) awareness program that addresses economic espionage and related
risks  to  research  and  development  activity  for  the  DOE/NNSA  population.  This  ef-
fort utilizes high-level guest speakers, awareness seminars provided by its CI Train-
ing Academy, and mutual support through other U.S. Intelligence Community mem-
bers  to  identify  potential  economic  espionage  threats  to  the  many  DOE/NNSA  sites
and labs. The CI Training Academy provides an awareness seminar, ‘‘Economic Es-
pionage:  Protecting  Intellectual  Property,’’  through  mobile  training  teams  for  DOE/
NNSA  employees  and  contractor  staff.  The  seminar  is  designed  to  increase  the
awareness  of  the  threat  to  intellectual  property,  the  vulnerabilities  associated  with
that threat, the risks of scientific interaction (collaboration), and the measures each
employee must take to protect our trade secrets.

Individual  CI  offices  at  DOE/NNSA  sites  and  labs  provide  pertinent  information
to assist employees in recognizing the potential threat of economic espionage. Many
of these sites have identified key staff that deal with technology transfer and other
sensitive  research  activities  for  specialized  briefings  on  economic  espionage  and  in-
telligence  activity  targeting  our  research.  This  subject  is  also  addressed  in  periodic
general  CI  awareness  briefings,  and  other  focused  briefings  and  tailored  presen-
tations,  which  at  times  address  specific  identified  activities.  For  example,  during
late  2004,  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  CI  Office  hosted  the  Unit  Chief  of
the  Economic  Espionage  Unit  from  FBI  Headquarters  who  tailored  the  message  to
the scientists and other key staff at the laboratory.

As  you  are  aware,  an  important  Departmental  vehicle  for  research  and  develop-
ment  is  the  Department’s  Cooperative  Research  and  Development  Agreement
(CRADA). This important vehicle allows joint research between laboratories and pri-
vate  corporations  on  commercially  viable  technologies  at  the  national  laboratories,
and  is  often  accomplished  in  collaboration  with  scientists  and  researchers  who  are
foreign  nationals  from  non-Departmental  facilities,  some  of  whom  are  in  foreign
countries.  While  U.S.  corporations  are  the  preferred  partners,  foreign  corporations
may participate in CRADAs.

In order to protect CRADAs, including those related to the field of energy, various
CI policies and programs have been implemented. On April 9, 2004, a memorandum
entitled, ‘‘Guidance to the Field Concerning Support to CRADA,’’ was distributed to
all CI offices throughout the DOE complex. The CI offices were directed to take ac-
tion  to  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  laboratory  support  elements  that  are  in-
volved with CRADAs to identify at-risk technologies, and develop CI support plans.
The  CI  support  plans  are  required  to  include  threat  assessments,  CI  awareness  ac-
tivities, and the conduct of briefings and debriefings and other pro-active investiga-
tive activities.

DOE has issued policy and requirements on unclassified foreign visits and assign-
ments which state that sensitive technology is not to be accessed by foreign nation-
als, including permanent resident aliens, without proper authorization. The OCI ac-
tively  supports  this  program  through  the  coordination  of  indices  checks  with  the
Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  and  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency,  and  the  con-
duct of various investigative activities such as briefings and debriefings.

DOE  maintains  a  sensitive  technologies  list,  which  is  distributed  throughout  the

DOE complex by OCI and is made part of its Awareness Program.

OCI supports the FBI in its various investigative activities which are responsible
for  enforcing  the  laws  pertaining  to  the  Economic  Espionage  Act  of  1996  (18  USC
1831  et  seq.),  and  the  disclosure  of  classified  and  sensitive  technology  to  foreign
countries or terrorist groups.

Leadership Class High-End Computing
Q1. We  all  applauded  the  Department  and  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory’s
progress  in  Leadership  Class  high-end  computing  and  we  look  forward  to  the
valuable  science  research  results  that  the  Cray  X–1  and  Red  Storm  machines
will produce. Can you explain how a $25 million cut to the Center for Computa-
tional Science at Oak Ridge will affect the implementation of plans for the Lead-
ership Class machines?

158

A1. The  $25  million  budget  for  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  Leadership
Class  Computing  effort  will  enable  researchers  to  operate  a  20  teraflop  Cray  X1e
and  a  20  teraflop  Cray  XT3  (better  known  as  Red  Storm)  computer  as  leadership
class resources for open science. These computers will be allocated through an open
process  to  a  small  number  of  teams  that  are  positioned  to  deliver  new  science  on
these  platforms.  This  multiple  machine  approach  was  what  ORNL  proposed  and
what won the competition in FY 2004. The two systems will be the largest systems
of their type available to the open scientific community in the U.S. They will provide
more  science  than  one  large  system  because  some  applications,  such  as  plasma
physics and global change, perform significantly better on the X1e than on the XT3
while other applications, such as materials science and chemistry, can deliver more
science per dollar on the XT3.
Q2. The  Industrial  Technologies  program  at  DOE  has  a  long  history  of  supporting
research  and  development  into  making  some  of  our  most  valued  core  domestic
industries,  the  same  industries  that  are  rapidly  heading  overseas.  Yet,  this  ad-
ministration  continues  to  decrease  support  of  this  program  at  a  time  when  it  is
most needed. Please explain how a 25 percent decrease in funding for industrial
technologies will affect our core domestic industrial sector.

A2. Industries,  particularly  our  core  domestic  energy-intensive  industries,  are  suc-
ceeding  in  their  attempts  to  be  more  energy  efficient,  in  part  because  of  the  past
successes  of  this  program  and  because  of  the  obvious  economic  incentives  they  face
to  cut  energy  costs.  Continuing  activities  in  the  Industries  of  the  Future  (Specific)
program will focus on bringing existing projects to successful commercialization and
evaluating opportunities for greater performance in FY 2006.
Q3. Transmission  Reliability  R&D  request  is  being  cut  by  more  than  40  percent,
from $15.6 million to $9.2 million. This is occurring at a time when the Nation’s
bulk power transmission is undergoing stresses and strains due to increased de-
mand for electric power and a lack of new transmission lines.
Many  observers  believe  that  we  will  not  be  able  to  build  enough  transmission
capacity to meet demand and that we will have to use the capacity we have bet-
ter and smarter. Why is the Administration cutting these programs now in light
of these circumstances?

A3. The  FY  2006  budget  request  for  the  Office  of  Electric  Transmission  and  Dis-
tribution,  which  includes  activities  formerly  conducted  by  the  Office  of  Energy  As-
surance,  supports  those  activities  which  the  Administration  believes  will  ensure
electricity reliability and energy critical infrastructure protection.

For  instance,  as  a  leader  in  the  Eastern  Interconnection  Phasor  Project,  the  De-
partment is working in partnership with the electric industry to transform the way
that electric grid operators monitor and process real-time information, to accelerate
response times to problems in system voltage and frequency levels. In addition, the
GridWorks  program  is  focused  on  development  of  next  generation  ‘‘hardware’’  tech-
nologies  (e.g.,  sensors;  cables  and  conductors;  substation  and  protective  equipment)
to address reliability concerns.

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $95.6  million,  which  includes  Energy  Assurance
activities  merged  by  Congress  with  OETD  activities  in  FY  2005,  is  a  19.4  percent
reduction  to  the  FY  2005  enacted  level  for  these  programs.  However,  funding  for
Congressionally-directed  projects  in  FY  2005  accounted  for  43  percent  of  OETD’s
overall  budget.  When  the  FY  2005  level  is  adjusted  for  this,  the  FY  2006  request
reflects an increase of over $25 million compared to the adjusted FY 2005 level.
Q4. Recent  studies  indicate  that  domestic  natural  gas  production  is  declining  at  a
rate of nearly 30 percent per year and we’re now importing more than 60 percent
of  our  oil.  Geologists  agree  that  there  is  much  moil  and  natural  gas  left  in  the
United  States  but  utilizing  it  will  require  unconventional  recovery  techniques.
Yet,  the  major  integrated  oil  companies  have  largely  abandoned  U.S.  onshore
production  in  favor  of  offshore  production  and  production  opportunities  over-
seas. Today, I’m told that independent oil and gas producers produce more than
60 percent of the oil and about 75 percent of the natural gas sold in this country,
but  they  have  no  ability  to  conduct  the  research  needed  to  get  the  hard-to-find
and  produce  hydrocarbons  out  of  the  ground.  In  light  of  that  fact,  what  is  the
justification  for  your  proposal  to  shut  down  the  oil  and  gas  research  programs
at this time?

A4. While it is true that the production rate of new natural gas wells declines about
30  percent  per  year,  industry  has  been  able  to  maintain  domestic  gas  production.
In  fact,  U.S.  gas  supplies  increased  overall  to  19.4  Trillion  cubic  feet  (tcf)  in  2003

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00162 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

159

from  19.2  tcf  in  2000.  You  are  also  correct  that  independents  produce  a  large  per-
centage  of  domestic  oil  and  natural  gas.  Although  the  smallest  independents  have
traditionally  funded  little  research,  other  independents,  the  service  companies  that
supply  technology  to  the  independents,  and  the  majors  have  the  financial  incentive
and  resources  to  develop  new  ways  to  extract  oil  and  gas  from  the  ground  more
cheaply and safely.

The  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  reports  that  the  28  U.S.  major  en-
ergy  companies  spent  $370  million  on  oil  and  gas  recovery  research  and  develop-
ment  in  2003,  the  latest  available  data.  An  analysis  of  industry  R&D  spending
(1997–2000),  reported  by  the  Interstate  Oil  and  Gas  Compact  Commission,  showed
that  the  oil  and  gas  service  industry  spent  $631  million  per  year  on  R&D.  The  De-
partment  believes  that  recent  high  oil  and  gas  prices  provide  the  incentive  to  sub-
stantially  increased  private  R&D  investments.  After  careful  review  of  the  oil  and
gas  programs,  it  was  determined  that  the  industry  has  the  capacity  to  pursue  this
research.

Clean Coal Power Initiative
Q5. The FY 2006 budget request includes $50 million for the Clean Coal Power Ini-
tiative,  which  is  the  $2  billion,  10-year  program  the  President  announced  four
years  ago  to  demonstrate  clean  burning  coal  technologies.  What  is  the  status  of
the  funding  for  this  program,  and  should  the  Administration  have  provided
more than $50 million for this initiative to keep the program on schedule?

A5. The Fiscal Year 2006 budget supports the Department’s continuing effort to ful-
fill  President  Bush’s  10-year,  $2  billion  commitment  to  clean  coal  research,  with
funding for the President’s Coal Research Initiative (CRI) of $286 million, a $13 mil-
lion  increase  over  the  2005  enacted  level.  The  2006  Budget  brings  the  total  re-
quested  funding  for  clean  coal  research  to  $1.6  billion  over  five  years,  on  pace  to
exceed the President’s ten-year pledge by more than 50 percent.

Within  the  President’s  Coal  Research  Initiative,  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative
(CCPI)  is  a  key  component  of  the  National  Energy  Policy  to  address  the  reliability
and  affordability  of  the  Nation’s  electricity  supply,  particularly  from  its  coal-based
generation. The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget request includes $68 million for CCPI, $50
million  of  which  is  for  demonstration  projects  and  $18  million  for  FutureGen,  the
world’s  first  near-zero  emissions  coal-fueled  power  plant.  The  Department  believes
the FY 2006 request is adequate to maintain the overall schedule of the Clean Coal
Power Initiative.

The  $50  million  allocated  for  the  cooperative,  cost-shared  CCPI  program  between
government  and  industry  will  be  devoted  to  continuing  the  rapid  demonstration  of
emerging technologies in coal-based power generation, which should accelerate com-
mercialization by the private sector.

The CCPI’s FutureGen program will establish the capability and feasibility of co-
producing electricity and hydrogen from coal with essentially zero emissions, includ-
ing  carbon  sequestration  and  gasification  combined  cycle,  both  integral  components
of  the  coal-fueled  power  plant  of  the  future.  In  addition  to  scheduled  financing  of
$18  million  for  FutureGen  in  Fiscal  Year  2006,  the  Budget  also  includes  a  commit-
ment  to  FutureGen  beyond  2006,  by  proposing  $257  million  to  become  available  in
2007  to  provide  the  federal  share  of  FutureGen  for  several  years.  This  sum  cor-
responds to unexpended funds available from prior years’ clean coal projects.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson

Historically Black Colleges and Universities
Q1. History  has  proven  when  it  comes  to  budget  cutting  time,  minority  education
programs get cut first. Since 1995, funding for minority education programs has
dropped  drastically.  In  1995,  funding  levels  for  Historically  Black  Colleges  and
Universities (HBCUs) were at $59.1 million or 8.4 percent of all funding for in-
stitutions  of  higher  education.  Since  then,  funding  levels  have  substantially  de-
creased.  In  fact,  in  2004,  HBCUs  only  received  $10.8  million,  only  1.4  percent
of  all  institutional  funding  for  higher  education.  We  all  agree  that  America
needs  a  diverse  work  force  to  remain  prosperous.  How  are  you  going  to  rectify
this serious spending inadequacy? (see chart below)

A1. Under my leadership, we are committed to the following initiatives in FY 2005:
(1)  to  establish  a  goal  of  $33.2  million  to  support  programs  for  Historically  Black
Colleges  and  Universities  (HBCUs),  which  is  $22.4  million  above  actual  awards  in
FY 2004; and (2) to establish a corporate strategy for increasing support for HBCUs
and  other  minority  serving  institutions,  which  includes  developing  a  Broad  Agency
Announcement  to  encourage  the  participation  of  HBCUs  in  the  Department’s  com-
petitive awards, supporting internships for students at DOE and/or its national lab-
oratories,  encouraging  faculty  exchange  programs  at  DOE  national  laboratories  to
enhance  faculty  research  capabilities,  and  convening  annual  regional  information
meetings to inform HBCU faculty and administrators of DOE programs and funding
opportunities.
Q2. According to the National Academy of Sciences, significant reductions in oil use
from  a  transition  to  hydrogen  are  at  least  one  or  two  decades  away.  How  does
your  budget  proposal  treat  R&D  efforts  that  are  more  focused  on  near-term  re-
sults,  such  as  research  on  lightweight,  high-strength  automotive  materials,  hy-
brid  vehicles  and  advanced  diesels?  How  can  DOE  do  a  better  job  of  encour-
aging the adoption of these energy-saving technologies into the marketplace?

A2. The  calculation  was  made  by  1)  analyzing  geology  and  geophysical  information
to determine geology parameters; 2) conducting an engineering analysis of the explo-
ration,  development,  production,  and  reclamation  phases  for  the  potential  range  of
sources;  and  3)  running  an  economic  analysis  of  1)  and  2)  under  projected  market
conditions.  As  we  have  stated  a  number  of  times,  this  estimate  has  been  used  for
several years and does not reflect the recent sharp increases in the price of oil. The
estimate included an assumption regarding oil prices in the year 2001 of $30. It as-
sumed a 50/50 split of revenues with the State of Alaska, a royalty rate of 12c  per-
cent, and that almost all tracts would be available for nomination in each sale. The
model used for the analysis was a Monte Carlo Discounted Cash Flow model. In ad-
dition,  natural  gas  was  assumed  at  the  time  of  the  analysis  to  be  uneconomic  and
was thus ignored in the valuation.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. Secretary Bodman, still looking at the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
numbers,  I  see  that  significant  cuts  were  requested  for  Building  Technologies
(¥12  percent)  and  Industrial  Technologies  (¥25  percent).  I  know  that  the  Vice
President has said that conservation is a virtue but shouldn’t be a part of energy
policy,  but  I  disagree  with  that  sentiment.  In  California,  where  consumers  were
the  victims  of  market  manipulation  by  Enron,  consumers  only  recourse  was  to
use  less  energy,  to  conserve.  As  long  as  our  energy  consumption  level  remain
high,  Americans  remain  vulnerable  to  Enron-like  manipulation  at  home  and  to
OPEC internationally. And yet this budget cuts funding for efficiency programs,

at the time when we should be making this one of our highest priorities. Dr. Sec-
retary, what is the rationale for doing this?

A1. We have focused on our most cost-effective activities that meet the Administra-
tion’s  general  R&D  investment  criteria  (quality,  relevance,  and  performance)  and
the  additional  criteria  (for  industry-related  programs)  that  ensure  that  federal  in-
vestment  is  appropriate,  well-planned,  and  has  the  potential  to  deliver  significant
public benefits.

On buildings technologies, we have developed a great many buildings technologies
and  techniques  that  have  not  yet  been  adopted  by  builders  or  demanded  by  con-
sumers. Higher energy prices may change that. However, until we are more success-
ful in getting existing technologies adopted, we are reducing some of our new build-
ing technology development activities.

As for industrial technologies, because industry is less likely to invest in R&D to-
ward long-term energy-savings technologies, our Industrial Technologies Program is
focusing  on  a  fewer  number  of  higher-risk,  higher-reward  technologies,  and  our
budget  reflects  that.  Fortunately,  the  industrial  sector  of  the  economy  is  already
quite  energy  efficient,  since  it  has  an  economic  incentive  and  the  financial  means
to reduce energy use as a component of its overall cost of production.

Basic Research in the Office of Science
Q2. Secretary  Bodman,  I  notice  that  within  the  Office  of  Science,  the  impact  of  the
budget is borne primarily by grants to individual researchers would be far larg-
er.  Some  programs  see  cuts  as  great  as  a  10  percent,  in  order  to  maintain  sup-
port  for  large  user  facilities.  While  I  applaud  the  support  for  user  facilities,  are
we  going  to  be  able  to  use  these  facilities  to  their  full  potential  if  we  don’t  pro-
vide  the  funds  for  the  researchers  to  use  them?  Dr.  McQueary  just  testified  that
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  was  going  to  depend  more  and  more  on
the output of DOE funded basic researchers to feed the efforts of his agency, and
the  Department  of  Defense  has  said  similar  things.  If  we  cut  the  funds  for  this
research,  are  we  not  compromising  our  national  security?  If  other  agencies  are
justifying cuts by saying that your agency is doing the research, do you feel some
obligation  to  it?  Do  your  agencies  talk  to  each  other  about  this?  Because  it
doesn’t seem like you are all on the same wave length.

A2. The  FY  2006  President’s  Request  for  the  Office  of  Science  represents  a  reduc-
tion  of  1.6  percent  from  the  FY  2005  appropriation  when  Congressional  directions
for FY 2005 are set aside and is 0.9 percent above the FY 2005 President’s Request.
Within  this  budget,  the  Office  of  Science  can  and  will  provide  world  leadership  in
science that contributes so heavily to our national security. Indeed, it is this respon-
sibility  that  has  led  to  the  priorities  that  are  contained  in  the  FY  2006  Office  of
Science budget request. These priorities balance support for individual investigators
with  support  for  forefront  facilities,  which  will  transform  the  way  we  do  science
from  manipulating  matter  to  discovering  the  deepest  secrets  of  the  universe.  The
President’s  FY  2006  budget  propels  the  United  States  into  leadership  in  a  number
of areas, including nanoscience and nanotechnology; neutron scattering for the study
of  materials  and  their  properties;  x-ray  science  with  pulses  so  short  that  they  will
allow  the  study  of  chemical  reactions  as  they  occur;  leadership-class  computing  for
discoveries in all areas of science; ITER, an experiment which will demonstrate the
feasibility  of  using  deuterium-tritium  fusion  to  produce  large  amounts  of  clean  en-
ergy;  climate  change  research;  and  more.  Moreover,  the  Office  of  Science  continues
its  leadership  role  in  such  research  areas  as  condensed  matter  and  materials
sciences;  chemistry  and  catalysis;  biosciences  and  genomics;  research  to  enable  the
coming  hydrogen  economy;  and  high-energy,  nuclear,  and  plasma  physics.  Within
this  budget,  we  have  endeavored  to  nurture  principal  investigators  in  our  core  re-
search areas and to ensure that all of our research activities are coordinated. Basic
research in the Office of Science supports applied research conducted by other DOE
programs and other federal agencies.

National Ignition Facility
Q3. Secretary Bodman, can you give us a status report on the National Ignition Fa-
cility (NIF)? What is a realistic timetable for the first attempt at ignition? What
is  the  impact  of  this  budget  request  on  that  timetable?  And  what  do  you  see  is
the role of NIF in basic scientific research?

A3. The  National  Ignition  Facility  (NIF)  at  Lawrence  Livermore  National  Labora-
tory  (LLNL)  continues  to  be  an  essential  component  of  the  Stockpile  Stewardship
Program.  Consistent  with  the  strong  views  of  the  Congress,  we  are  continuing  to-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00165 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

162

wards  full  commissioning  of  all  192  beams  and  focus  on  the  2010  ignition  goal.  To
do this, however, we have had to accept additional risks and reduce some other iner-
tial  confinement  fusion  work  at  LLNL  and  other  sites.  The  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2006
request of $460.4 million for the Inertial Confinement Fusion and High Yield Cam-
paign, a 14 percent reduction from FY 2005, reflects those reductions.

The  NIF  Activation  and  Early  Use  Plan  defines  the  experimental  program  to  be
executed on NIF through the demonstration of ignition. Due to reductions in the FY
2005  appropriations  for  the  NIF  Demonstration  Program  and  changes  in  the  FY
2006–2010  funding  profile  from  that  previously  planned,  the  NIF  Activation  and
Early  Use  Plan  is  being  modified.  NNSA  will  provide  a  revised  NIF  Activation  and
Early  Use  Plan  to  Congress  by  June  30,  2005,  which  will  describe  the  implications
of these budget changes.

Inertial fusion ignition is one of the greatest technical challenges ever pursued by
the Department. The demonstration of ignition at NIF will allow the Stockpile Stew-
ardship  Program  to  address  weapon  performance  issues  related  to  thermonuclear
burn,  while  simultaneously  advancing  our  understanding  in  many  areas  of  basic
science. Further, consistent with the established NIF mission, and as allowed by es-
tablished  program  objectives  and  requirements,  a  portion  of  the  NIF  experimental
opportunities  will  be  available  to  the  technical  community  to  pursue  unique  re-
search  opportunities  after  ignition  has  been  achieved.  The  new  temperature  and
pressures  regimes  accessible  with  NIF  will  open  up  a  host  of  new  opportunities  in
basic research, ranging from laboratory astrophysics to fundamental materials prop-
erties.  In  the  National  Research  Council’s  2003  report,  ‘‘Frontiers  in  High  Energy
Density Physics,’’ it states,

‘‘. . .research  opportunities  in  this  crosscutting  area  of  physics  are  of  the  high-
est  intellectual  caliber  and  are  fully  deserving  of  the  consideration  of  support
by the leading funding agencies of the physical sciences.’’

Question submitted by Representative Lincoln Davis

New Programs for SciDAC
Q1. Secretary Bodman, you may be aware that I support the United States regaining
leadership  in  high-end  computing  and  co-sponsored  the  Department  of  Energy
High-End  Computing  Revitalization  Act  of  2004.  The  purpose  of  this  bill  is  to
support  the  computational  needs  of  non-classified  scientific  research.  I’m  proud
that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been selected to be the home of the
new facility that will be the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS)—the most
powerful supercomputer in the world.
The  facilities  plan  for  the  Office  of  Science  ranks  CCS  as  the  #1  domestic  pri-
ority, yet the budget does not reflect a commitment to this priority. I understand
that  the  total  request  for  the  Office  of  Advanced  Scientific  Computing  Research
is  down  $25  million,  funding  for  CCS  is  down  $42  million,  but  the  request  in-
cludes two new ‘‘starts’’ totaling about $21 million.
Please explain the reasons behind starting two new programs for Scientific Dis-
covery  through  Advanced  Computing  (SciDAC)  teams  within  the  Office  of  Ad-
vanced Scientific Computing Research budget while failing to find funds to keep
high performance computing efforts on track at the Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory.

A1. The  principles  behind  the  budget  decisions  are  to  deliver  the  most  science  for
the  Nation  given  the  funds  available.  The  Advanced  Scientific  Computing  Research
(ASCR)  budget  includes  $13  million  for  research  and  evaluation  prototype  com-
puters and $8 million for a new competition for SciDAC institutes. The research and
evaluation (R&E) prototype activity has been a part of the ASCR budget for a num-
ber  of  years.  In  FY  2005  the  CCS  will  complete  the  evaluations  that  were  funded
in  prior  years.  Therefore,  we  will  solicit  proposals  for  new  R&E  prototypes  in  FY
2006. This type of activity was strongly endorsed in the Federal Plan for High-End
Computing, which was published by the Office of Science and Technology Policy last
May. The new competition for SciDAC institutes will increase the impact of our in-
vestments in applied mathematics and computer science and respond directly to the
direction  in  the  Department  of  Energy  High-End  Computing  Revitalization  Act  of
2004  to  establish  high  end  computing  software  development  centers  for  Leadership
Class Computing.

Question submitted by Representative Brian Baird
Q1. In a recent story in the Seattle Times, you were quoted as saying that the Bonne-
ville  Power  Administration  (BPA)  ‘‘is  subsidized  by  other  (non-Northwest)  tax-
payers.’’  (http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002179458¥bpa14m.
html).  In  fact,  Northwest  ratepayers  have  repaid  the  Treasury  with  interest  for
the  construction  and  operation  of  the  system  and  we  continue  to  do  so.  As  you
know,  Northwest  ratepayers  made  another  billion  dollar  payment  to  Treasury
this past September.
Can you explain for me how you and others in this administration justify label-
ing BPA as being subsidized by taxpayers?

A1. The Administration has stated in the President’s FY 2006 Budget that ‘‘Accord-
ing  to  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO),  PMA  rates  are  artificially  low
because taxpayers across the Nation have borne some of the PMAs’ costs. Thus, the
general  taxpayer  has  helped  subsidize  the  costs  of  PMA  power  purchased  by  elec-
tricity wholesales.’’

At  the  time  of  the  GAO  review,  two  categories  of  net  costs  to  the  federal  govern-
ment  were  identified  for  BPA  (GAO/AIMD  97–110A).  One  was  the  full  cost  of  pro-
viding  Civil  Service  Retirement  System  pension  benefits  and  the  costs  of  providing
post-retirement health benefits to current employees. The other area was identified
as  net  financing  costs,  which  GAO  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  interest
income  received  by  the  Federal  Government  on  appropriated  debt  and  the  Federal
Government’s related interest expense.

Questions submitted by Representative Jim Matheson
Q1. Are  you  aware  that  the  tailings  pile  currently  rests  10–15  feet  above  the  water
level of the Colorado River, a major water source for the millions of people who
live downstream?

A1. Yes.  The  Department  has  completed  extensive  site  characterization  to  confirm
that  the  bottom  of  the  contaminated  tailings  pile  is  10  to  15  feet  above  the  water
level of the Colorado River.
Q2. A  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report  emphasized  the  risks  posed  by  the  loca-
tion of the radioactive tailings next to the Colorado River, stating it was a ‘‘near
certainty’’ that, left unchecked, the river would run across the Moab site at some
point in the future. Do you agree with these conclusions and how will DOE ad-
dress the NAS report’s concerns?

A2. DOE has incorporated the National Academies of Sciences’ conclusions into the
environmental  impact  statement  (EIS).  The  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  alter-
native  of  disposing  of  the  tailings  pile  and  other  contaminated  material,  primarily
via rail, at the proposed Crescent Junction disposal site.
Q3. Are you aware that on 26 occasions since 1914, the river has reached a flow level

great enough to inundate the base of the tailings pile?

A3. The  Department’s  understanding  is  that  the  flood  that  occurred  in  1984,  re-
ferred  to  as  the  100-year  flood,  is  the  only  flood  in  which  the  flood  level  actually
reached  the  toe  of  the  tailings  pile,  but  did  not  inundate  the  base  of  the  tailings
pile.
Q4. Are you aware that a November 2003 report by DOE, which stated that the Colo-
rado River would only migrate away from the tailings pile and would not under-
mine the tailings embankment, has been proven wrong?

A4. The Department of Energy (DOE) is not aware of any data that proves the DOE
November 2003 Colorado River Migration report is incorrect.
Q5. Are  you  aware  that  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  has  recently  stated  that
during a ‘‘100-year flood’’ the Colorado River could feasibly climb 25 feet up the
tailings pile, the channel could deepen and narrow, and water could move much
more  swiftly  through  the  tailings  site?  How  do  you  intend  to  address  USGS’s
findings, given the Department’s erroneous previous conclusions?

A5. The U.S. Geological Survey report states that under the 100-year flood scenario,
the  river  level  would  climb  approximately  four  feet  up  the  tailings  pile  as  occurred
during the 1984 flood. The report also indicates that during this flood event, the un-
protected pile would not be breached because velocities would decrease as the river
flows over its banks.

Q6. How  will  DOE  incorporate  into  the  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement  the
USGS’s  findings  from  a  February  1,  2005,  Open  File  Report  that  a  100-year
flood  event  could  erode  a  very  long  stretch  of  the  Colorado  River  bank  on  the
side of the river that contains the tailings?

A6. The  findings 
in  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey’s  (USGS)  recent  Colorado
Streamflow  Simulation  Report  are  being  incorporated  into  the  final  environmental
impact  statement  (EIS)  analysis.  The  Department  will  continue  to  work  with  the
USGS  through  the  finalization  of  the  EIS  to  ensure  that  the  Department  is  inter-
preting  the  USGS  data  correctly.  The  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  alternative
of disposing of the tailings pile and other contaminated material, primarily via rail,
at the proposed Crescent Junction disposal site.
Q7. Is DOE planning to take ‘‘100-year floods’’ conditions into account when making

the decision about the how to remediate the Atlas tailings pile?

A7. Yes, the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) assesses the consequences
of  both  the  100-year  flood,  and  the  probable  maximum  flood.  The  Department  will
incorporate  into  the  Final  EIS  a  preferred  alternative  of  disposing  of  the  tailings
pile  and  other  contaminated  material,  primarily  via  rail,  at  the  proposed  Crescent
Junction disposal site.
Q8. Given  the  risk  of  damage  downstream  if  flooding  occurs  on  the  Colorado  River
at  the  Atlas  site,  why  would  DOE  opt  not  to  remove  the  tailings  pile  from  the
banks of the river?

A8. The Department is in the process of developing the final environmental impact
statement  (EIS)  for  the  Moab  uranium  mill  tailings  site.  The  Final  EIS  will  have
a preferred alternative of disposing of the tailings pile and other contaminated ma-
terial, primarily via rail, at the proposed Crescent Junction disposal site.
Q9. Are  you  aware  that  NAS  identified  river  erosion  and  migration  as  a  critical
issue  that  must  be  resolved  before  DOE  makes  its  decision  about  how  to  reme-
diate  the  site  of  the  Atlas  Tailings  pile?  How  will  the  Department  address  the
issue of river erosion with respect to the tailings?

A9. Yes.  The  Department  is  aware  that  river  migration  is  a  critical  issue  and  has
incorporated  design  elements  into  the  draft  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)
to  address  this  concern.  The  broad  range  of  remedial  action  alternatives  identified
in the Draft EIS have been analyzed for impacts due to natural phenomena hazards,
such  as  flooding,  river  migration,  seismic  activity,  and  erosion,  taking  into  account
the effects of mitigating measures such as a barrier wall to prevent river migration
and  riprap-covered  side  slopes  that  would  mitigate  the  erosion  forces  of  the  river
at flood stage. Based on the Draft EIS analysis and nearly 1,400 comments received,
the  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  alternative  of  disposing  of  the  tailings  pile  and
other  contaminated  material,  primarily  via  rail,  at  the  proposed  Crescent  Junction
disposal site.
Q10. Has DOE considered in its analysis a report by the National Research Council,

which concluded that flooding is a near certainty at the site?

A10. Yes.  The  draft  environmental  impact  statement  addresses  flooding  and  quan-
tifies the impacts that would result.
Q11. Are  you  aware  that  the  tailings  pile  is  leaking  ammonia,  various  metals,  and
radio-nuclides into the river, such that when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
did fish surveys, the caged minnows they dipped into the water, died instantly?
A11. The  Department  is  aware  of  the  existing  impacts  from  this  former  uranium-
processing site and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys.
Q12. Are you aware that, contrary to DOE reports, an independent study by Univer-
sity of Utah hydrologists determined that contamination from the Atlas tailings
pile has traveled under the Colorado River, towards the town of Moab and the
aquifer that provides drinking water to the community?

A12. The Department is aware of the University’s study. The Department, with the
aid  of  other  federal  organizations  and  several  experts,  has  collected  data  that  does
not support those conclusions in the University of Utah’s investigation. Nonetheless,
based  on  the  draft  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  and  nearly  1,400  com-
ments  received  on  the  Draft  EIS,  the  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  alternative
of disposing of the tailings pile and other contaminated material, primarily via rail,
at the proposed Crescent Junction disposal site.

Q13. A  report  by  the  House  Government  Reform  Committee  found  that,  of  the  22
uranium  tailings  piles  located  along  the  Colorado  River  corridor,  the  Atlas
tailings  site  was  the  only  pile  that  had  not  been  removed.  In  fact,  DOE  has
removed  the  tailings  piles  from  all  Uranium  Mill  Tailings  Radiation  Control
Act  (UMTRCA)  sites  located  within  a  flood  plain,  with  the  exception  of  the
Atlas site. Given this history, why would DOE choose not to remove the tailings
from their current site?

A13. The Department has remediated 21 of the 22 uranium mill tailings sites under
Title I of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act. Two of the 21 sites (two
at Rifle, Colorado) were located adjacent to the Colorado River and the tailings were
removed  from  the  floodplain.  Of  the  other  19  Title  I  sites  remediated  by  DOE,  ten
were stabilized in place and nine were relocated. Based on the draft environmental
impact statement (EIS) analysis and the 1,400 comments received on the Draft EIS,
the  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  alternative  of  disposing  of  the  tailings  pile  and
other  contaminated  material,  primarily  via  rail,  at  the  proposed  Crescent  Junction
disposal site.
Q14. Congress  stated  in  the  Floyd  Spence  Defense  Authorization  bill  that  ‘‘The  Sec-
retary (of Energy) shall conduct remediation at the Moab site in a safe and en-
vironmentally sound manner that takes into consideration A) ground water res-
toration and B) the removal, to a site in the State of Utah, for permanent dis-
position  and  any  necessary  stabilization  of  residual  radioactive  material  and
other contaminated material from the Moab site and the floodplain of the Colo-
rado River.’’ Given Congress’ intent to remove the tailings pile from its current
location,  why  did  DOE  choose  not  to  designate  a  preferred  alternative  in  the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement that would move the tailings to another
location?

A14. Based  on  the  draft  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  analysis  and  the
1,400  comments  received  on  the  Draft  EIS,  the  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  al-
ternative of disposing of the tailings pile and other contaminated material, primarily
via rail, at the proposed Crescent Junction disposal site.
Q15. DOE has previously stated that the legislative history of UMTRCA stressed the
importance  of  avoiding  remedial  action  that  would  only  be  temporarily  effec-
tive.  Given  the  probability  that  flooding  will  occur  in  at  the  Atlas  tailings  site
while the uranium tailings are still radioactive and the fact that such an event
would  require  further  remediation  of  the  tailings  pile  if  it  is  left  on  site,  why
would  the  Department  of  Energy  consider  a  remediation  plan  that  leaves  the
tailings pile on site?

A15. The  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  requires  that  all  reasonable  alter-
natives, including the no action alternative of leaving the pile in place, be analyzed.
The  broad  range  of  remedial  action  alternatives  identified  in  the  draft  EIS  have
been  analyzed  for  impacts  due  to  natural  phenomena  hazards,  such  as  flooding,
river migration, seismic activity, and erosion. Based on the draft environmental im-
pact statement (EIS) analysis and the nearly 1,400 comments received on the Draft
EIS,  the  Final  EIS  will  have  a  preferred  alternative  of  disposing  the  tailings  pile
and other contaminated material, primarily via rail, at the proposed Crescent Junc-
tion disposal site.
Q16. I am concerned that short-term cost considerations are dominating DOE’s deci-
sion on how to remediate the tailings pile. It is equally, if not more, important
to  consider  the  life-cycle  costs  of  the  remediation  options  over  time.  A  NAS  re-
port found that capping the tailing pile in place at the Atlas tailings site would
require  long-term  maintenance  and  further  investment.  Has  DOE  considered
the  life-cycle  costs  that  would  develop  over  the  long-term  if  the  decision  was
made not to remove the tailings from the site?

A16. Yes. The draft Moab Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) considers the life-
cycle  costs  of  all  on-site,  off-site,  and  groundwater  alternatives,  as  well  as  cumu-
lative impacts and risks. As reported in the draft EIS, the life-cycle cost for the on-
site stabilization alternative is $249 million and the relocation alternatives cost esti-
mates  range  from  $407  million  to  $542  million.  These  cost  estimates  include  long-
term groundwater extraction, as well as routine maintenance.

Long-term groundwater remediation is required for a period of 75 to 80 years, re-

gardless of the tailings pile remedial action employed.
Q17. Congress  has  dedicated  funding  toward  the  remediation  of  the  Atlas  Tailings
site  in  Fiscal  Years  2001,  2002,  2003,  2004,  and  2005.  How  much  funding  is
DOE requesting in the Fiscal Year 2006 budget to initiate the tailings removal?

What activities will that funding cover? Would additional funding enable DOE
to proceed more promptly with this clean-up work?

A17. The  FY  2006  Congressional  Budget  Request  for  the  Atlas  site  in  Moab,  Utah,
is  $28.06  million.  The  following  activities  are  planned:  complete  Remedial  Action
Plan (conceptual design); support the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s review
and concurrence with remedial action plan; initiate detailed reclamation design; ini-
tiate construction of final groundwater corrective action system; continue operation/
optimization  of  interim  groundwater  corrective  actions  to  accelerate  interim  protec-
tion of threatened and endangered species; continue to monitor the groundwater and
surface water; continue characterization and remediation of vicinity properties; and
operate  and  maintain  site  including  tailings  dewatering  system,  access  controls,
health  and  safety,  surface  controls  and  air  monitoring,  and  vegetation/habitat  im-
provements. The Department has requested funding commensurate with an acceler-
ated schedule and additional funding at this planning and early design phase of the
project would not necessarily enable further acceleration.

Nuclear Weapons Testing
Q18. During your recent testimony before the SASC, you seemed to indicate that nu-
clear  weapons  testing  might  resume  sooner  than  has  been  previously  acknowl-
edged by DOE. Please comment or elaborate on this issue.

A18. I  want  to  be  clear  about  our  plans.  We  have  no  plan  to  resume  underground
nuclear  testing;  our  efforts  to  improve  test  readiness  are  a  prudent  hedge  against
the  possibility  of  a  problem  arising  in  the  stockpile  that  cannot  be  confirmed,  or  a
fix  certified,  without  a  nuclear  test.  Our  goal  is  to  achieve  an  18-month  test  readi-
ness  posture  as  directed  by  section  3113  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act
for  Fiscal  Year  2004  (Public  Law  No.  108–136).  At  the  February  15,  2005,  Senate
Armed Services Committee hearing, I said that the DOE continues to be committed
to that requirement of the law, and the budget that has been proposed by the Presi-
dent is consistent with that program.

Question submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. In  2002,  President  Bush  signed  into  law  a  bill  that  was  intended  to  double  the
NSF  budget.  Clearly,  this  is  not  reflected  in  the  NSF’s  budget  request.  Dr.
Marburger  has  testified  before  this  committee  that  ‘‘this  Administration  under-
stands  that  science  and  technology  are  major  drivers  of  economic  growth’’  and
presumably  that  is  why  the  President  signed  the  bill.  But  once  again  the  Presi-
dent has delivered a budget that fails to back up the lofty rhetoric. Cutting fund-
ing  for  math  and  science  education  will  hamper  our  nation  in  the  very  fields
he claims are drivers of economic growth.
How  do  you  explain  this  lack  of  follow  through,  especially  given  what  Dr.
McQueary  has  said  about  how  his  agency  plans  to  rely  on  discoveries  made  by
scientists  funded  by  NSF?  Please  don’t  just  tell  me  that  these  are  tight  budget
times. The President seems to be able to come up with money for more tax cuts,
but not to invest in our futures.

A1. The  National  Science  Foundation  Authorization  Act  of  2002  (P.L.  107–368,  De-
cember 19, 2002) outlined three overarching objectives: to bolster the United States’
lead in science and technology, to enhance workforce skills, and to increase innova-
tion and competitiveness by expanding the focus of related policy at the regional and
local  levels.  Funding  authorized  in  this  bill  would  have  effectively  doubled  NSF’s
budget from $4.96 billion in FY 2002 to $9.84 billion in FY 2007.

Recent  events,  however,  have  made  this  funding  path  unlikely  in  the  near  term.
The President’s budget, as you know, focuses on winning the war on terror, securing
the  homeland,  and  restoring  fiscal  balance.  Amid  these  priorities,  the  Administra-
tion  requests  a  2.4  percent  funding  increase  for  NSF  at  a  time  when  domestic  dis-
cretionary  spending  is  decreasing.  Senate  Report  108–353,  issued  by  the  Senate
Committee on Appropriations (September 21, 2004), notes the significance of overall
funding constraints:

‘‘The  Committee  continues  to  be  supportive  of  the  efforts  achieved  in  the  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation  Authorization  Act  of  2002  (Public  Law  107–368)  and
the  pursuit  of  a  doubling  path  for  NSF  funding.  However,  due  to  funding  con-
straints,  the  Committee  is  not  able  to  provide  such  funding  at  this  time,  but
will continue to pursue these efforts in the future.’’ (p.135)

Despite  these  constraints,  the  President  has  recognized  the  importance  of  the
goals  outlined  in  the  2002  Authorization.  NSF’s  FY  2006  Budget  Request  is  built
around  four  funding  priorities:  1)  strengthening  core  disciplinary  research,  2)  pro-
viding  accessible  cyberinfrastructure  and  world-class  research  facilities,  3)  broad-
ening  participation  in  the  science  and  engineering  workforce,  and  4)  sustaining  or-
ganizational  excellence.  This  focus  on  a  clear  set  of  priorities  will  help  the  Nation
meet new challenges and take advantage of promising opportunities while spurring
growth and prosperity. In short, the FY 2006 Request seeks to maintain the science
and education investments needed to achieve the objectives of the FY 2002 Author-
ization. Although the timeline has changed, these objectives have not.

merce

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. Some  companies  have  told  us  that  they  are  at  a  competitive  disadvantage
around  the  world  because  the  other  nations  are  choosing  European  standards
over  U.S.  standards.  The  European  standards-setting  process  is  government-
funded and government-led, while the U.S. system is more market-based and in-
dustry-driven.  Does  our  system  put  our  companies  at  a  disadvantage?  If  so,
what should we do about it?

A1. The  United  States  is  a  market-driven,  highly  diversified  economy  and  society,
and our standards system encompasses and reflects this framework. Our decentral-
ized, sector-based standards system, which is based on a strong public-private sector
partnership, is diverse and inclusive, and supports flexible solutions. U.S. companies
derive significant advantage from the system’s flexibility and responsiveness.

Many U.S.-developed standards are used globally. Depending on a specific sector’s
needs,  preferred  standards  may  be  U.S.  standards,  those  developed  by  the  Inter-
national  Organization  for  Standardization  or  International  Electrotechnical  Com-
mission (IEC), or other globally recognized standards, including consortia-developed
standards.

Many  European  Union  (EU)  regional  standards  are  demand-driven  as  well,  but
some  are  developed  specifically  to  meet  European  regulatory  requirements.  It  is
these standards, and accompanying European regulations, that are not only used in
the growing EU market, but are also being promoted for use in emerging economies,
which  comprise  some  of  the  major  U.S.  export  markets.  In  these  markets,  the  EU
devotes more resources than the United States to standards-related technical assist-
ance.

The U.S. Government, working with the private sector, can do a better job of pro-
moting U.S. standards interests in our most important markets. Our message needs
to  incorporate  U.S.  principles  of  effective  standardization,  which  stress  that  stand-
ards  development  be  driven  by  the  marketplace,  stress  that  those  standards  have
good technical content, and allow for multiple technologies. The fact that U.S. Gov-
ernment  agencies  rely  to  a  great  extent  on  private  sector  standards  in  their  own
regulatory  and  procurement  activities  should  be  a  part  of  our  message  to  foreign
governments  as  well.  The  importance  of  developing  a  positive  and  persuasive  mes-
sage is especially critical in key emerging markets where standards regimes are still
in the formative stage.

The  Commerce  Department  launched  its  Standards  Initiative  in  2003  to  ensure
that  the  Federal  Government  works  effectively  to  promote  U.S.  standards  interests
and  to  eliminate  standards-related  market  barriers  that  undermine  U.S.  exports
and threaten the international competitiveness of U.S. industry. A Departmental re-
port—‘‘Standards  &  Competitiveness:  Coordinating  for  Results,’’  May  2004  which
can  be  found  at  http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/210//trade¥barriers¥report.pdf—pre-
sents  a  broad  set  of  recommendations,  some  of  which  address  outreach  and  pro-
motion.

The  Commerce  Department  is  working  with  partner  agencies  on  the  Trade  Pro-
motion  Coordinating  Committee  to  build  on  these  recommendations  and  craft  a
trade  promotion  strategy  for  the  coming  year  that  recognizes  the  importance  of
standards  to  the  export  competitiveness  of  American  companies.  Our  strategy  aims
to develop an ambitious partnership with U.S. manufacturers and service providers,
and  the  U.S.  standards  community,  to  better  promote  U.S.  standards  interests  in
our most important markets. This includes not only emerging, fast-growing markets
such  as  China,  but  also  the  EU  itself,  where  we  are  working  under  the  framework
of the U.S.–EU Regulatory Cooperation Roadmap to identify areas where we can co-
ordinate to facilitate a barrier-free transatlantic marketplace.
Q2. While  we  are  generally  supportive  of  the  Administration’s  proposal  to  expand
tsunami detection and warning capabilities to all U.S. coasts and territories, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) budget request cuts
by  nearly  50  percent  (from  $4.3  million  to  $2.3  million)  the  Tsunami  Hazard
Mitigation Program. This program provides funding for education and outreach
activities  as  well  as  helps  local  communities  with  evacuation  planning.  Wit-
nesses at our tsunami hearing stated that these education activities were just as
important  as  the  technology  for  detection.  Why  was  this  program  cut  in  half
when NOAA is requesting $9.5 million for new buoys?

A2. The President’s fiscal year (FY) 2006 Budget request of $2.3 million for the Na-
tional  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP)  is  the  same  amount  as  the
Administration has requested in past years. In FY 2005, the Congress appropriated
an additional $1.9 million for the NTHMP.

In  addition  to  the  $2.3  million  for  the  NTHMP  requested  in  the  President’s  FY
2006 Budget, the Administration’s two-year tsunami warning proposal, which is not
just for new buoys, allocates an additional $4.75 million for education and outreach,
and mitigation and inundation mapping. NOAA’s inundation mapping and modeling
efforts  are  a  critical  component  to  community  preparedness,  providing  information
on  safe  evacuation  routes.  Also  critical  are  NOAA’s  efforts  in  public  education  and
outreach,  including  the  TsunamiReady  program.  Of  the  $4.75  million  allocated,
$2.25  million  will  be  spent  on  inundation  mapping  and  modeling  and  $2.5  million
will  go  towards  public  education  activities.  The  Administration’s  two-year  proposal
also directly funds NOAA’s operation and maintenance costs for the Deep-ocean As-
sessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoys, and continued research and de-
velopment  for  the  DART  systems;  these  activities  were  previously  funded  by  the
NTHMP.  With  the  Administration’s  proposal  funding  activities  formerly  contained
within the NTHMP line item, more of the $2.3 million base funding for the NTHMP
can be directed towards education and outreach efforts. Overall, the Administration
is  increasing  funding  for  tsunami  education  and  outreach  with  the  President’s  FY
2006 Budget Request.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. The  Administration  is  requesting  $1.05  billion  for  its  Nanotechnology  Initiative
in  FY06.  Last  week,  I  met  with  some  small  start-up  nanotech  firms  who  are
members of the Nanotechnology Alliance. They said their biggest hurdle was the
lack of funding to translate research results to proof-of-concept—crossing the so-
called valley of death. Though they thought the U.S. was leading in most areas
of  basic  nanotechnology  research,  they  also  felt  that  we  were  falling  behind  in
applied  research.  Other  countries  have  specific  programs  to  fund  applied
nanotechnology  research.  These  nanotech  firms  mentioned  the  Advanced  Tech-
nology  Program  (ATP)  as  bridging  this  gap  in  the  United  States  and  said  that
we needed to support the ATP (or some similarly designed program) in order to
ensure the U.S. reaps the benefits in terms of jobs and economic competitiveness.
You  propose  eliminating  the  ATP.  Why  isn’t  the  Administration  listening  to  the
concerns of our high-tech entrepreneurs?

A1. The  United  States  has  the  deepest  pool  of  private  investment  capital  in  the
world  available  to  entrepreneurs  with  credible  project  funding  proposals.  According
to the National Venture Capital Association an estimated $20.9 billion was invested
by venture capitalists in the United States in 2004. The Department appreciates the
Committee’s  efforts  in  promoting  nanotechnology.  We  share  the  desire  to  translate
research results to proof-of-concept and see to it that our nation does not fall behind
in applied research. Nevertheless, we believe that other National Institute of Stand-
ards  and  Technology  (NIST)  research  and  development  programs  have  profoundly
greater impact than the ATP, and are essential to the continued technological lead-
ership  of  U.S.-based  business,  American  workers,  and  the  economy.  In  this  time  of
budgetary  constraint,  the  Administration  believes  that  reductions  must  be  made  to
certain  programs  so  that  available  resources  can  be  redirected  towards  higher  pri-
ority initiatives.
Q2. The  Administration  proposes  a  $47.5  million  increase  for  the  National  Institute
of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  lab  programs.  Generally,  I  would  be
pleased  about  this  increase,  but  it  seems  to  be  based  upon  source  budget  gim-
micks  similar  to  Enron  and  WorldCom  accounting.  The  NIST  budget  request
does  not  include  ATP  close-out  costs.  It  is  my  understanding  that  termination
costs would include:
• $15  million  for  employee  termination  [the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget

estimates $12 million, NIST estimates $18 million];

• $13 million of ATP funds which are transferred to the NIST lab program; and
• $43.5 million in funding for existing ATP projects.
Thus, ATP close out costs could be as high as $71.5 million. Why didn’t the Ad-
ministration include ATP close-out costs in its budget request? And had you in-
cluded these close-out costs, what would have been the impact on the budget re-
quest?

A2. We understand your concerns with respect to ATP close-out costs, and we agree
that  an  orderly  shutdown  of  the  ATP  is  not  without  expense,  and  we  believe  that
the  proposed  shutdown  can  be  accomplished  within  the  proposed  Department  of
Commerce  budget.  If  Congress  enacts  the  FY  2006  President’s  Budget  proposal  to
terminate funding for ATP, the Department of Commerce and NIST will pursue all
available means to address the termination cost requirements, consistent with legal
obligations and sound management practices.
Q3. Since  2001  we  have  lost  2.8  million  manufacturing  jobs.  This  past  December
alone we lost another 25,000. The Administration’s FY 2004 Manufacturing Ex-
tension Program (MEP) Impacts Report says that MEP increased sales by $4 bil-
lion  and  created  over  50,000  jobs  (these  numbers  reflect  results  from  just  @  of
the recipients, so they are very conservative).

Q3a. What  other  federal  program  produces  the  kind  of  return  on  investment  that

MEP has demonstrated?

Q3b. Given  the  performance  of  MEP  and  the  economic  situation  in  manufacturing,
why  hasn’t  the  Administration  brought  forward  a  budget  proposing  to  expand
MEP?

Q3c. How  many  MEP  centers  will  end  up  being  closed  under  this  proposal  and

where are they located?

A3a,b,c. The  Administration  proposes  to  fund  the  program  at  $46.8  million.  With
about  50  percent  of  the  FY  2005  center  grants,  the  Administration  seeks  to  main-
tain a national network of centers while focusing funding based on centers’ perform-
ance  and  need.  The  FY  2006  Budget  is  not  intended  to  reduce  the  number  of  cen-
ters.

The  President’s  FY  2006  Budget  aims  to  promote  economic  growth  by  supporting
innovation  and  technological  advancement  through  investment  in  federal  science
and  technology  programs.  In  the  FY  2006  Budget,  total  federal  R&D  investment  is
$132.3  billion,  an  increase  of  $733  million  over  this  year’s  record  R&D  budget  and
a 45 percent increase compared to FY 2001’s $91.3 billion budget. Funding for basic
research,  the  fuel  for  future  technology  development,  is  $26.6  billion  in  FY  2006,
compared to $21.3 billion in FY 2001—a 26 percent increase. Ninety-five percent of
this  spending  occurs  outside  the  Department  of  Defense.  The  FY  2006  Budget  also
includes  a  12.7  percent  increase  for  the  laboratory  programs  at  the  National  Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  which  provide  the  infrastructure  necessary  to
promote innovation and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of U.S. manu-
facturers.

The President worked with Congress to provide tax relief that has benefited man-
ufacturers of all sizes and supports permanent extension of the research and experi-
mentation  tax  credit,  as  well  as  legal,  regulatory  and  other  policy  changes  to
strengthen the manufacturing sector.

As  recommended  in  the  Administration’s  Manufacturing  Report,  NIST’s  Hollings
Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program (HMEP) continues to work with the
International  Trade  Administration  (ITA)  on  joint  activities  in  training,  and  cross
referral  between  HMEP  centers  and  local  ITA  offices.  One  of  the  strengths  of  the
HMEP  network  has  been  its  utility  to  other  federal  agencies;  we  will  continue  to
aggressively  pursue  partnerships  to  leverage  the  network.  Last  year,  federal  part-
ners provided an additional $7 million in funding to centers.

In  addition,  the  Administration  has  established  a  special  interagency  working
group  under  the  aegis  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  as  a  forum
for  developing  consensus  and  revolving  issues  associated  with  manufacturing  R&D
policy,  programs  and  budget  guidance  and  direction.  On  April  8,  2004,  former  Sec-
retary of Commerce Evans established the Secretary’s Manufacturing Council to en-
sure that manufacturers of all sizes will have a voice in implementing the Adminis-
tration’s manufacturing initiative.
Q4. The  FY03  and  FY04  requests  for  MEP  were  both  $13  million;  the  FY05  request
was $39 million; now we get $46.8 million. Can you explain the process whereby
the Administration determines the proper funding level for MEP?

A4. As  noted  above,  the  FY  2006  Budget  request  proposes  to  fund  HMEP  at  $46.8
million.  At  this  level,  the  national  network  of  centers  will  be  maintained  while  fo-
cusing  funding  based  on  centers’  performance  and  need.  The  fiscal  discipline  re-
quired in developing this budget, as in other budgets, required making tough choices
among  competing  programs.  Those  choices  vary  somewhat  from  year  to  year.  The
FY  2006  Request  reflects  the  Administration’s  current  analysis  of  priorities  for
NIST, while adhering to a goal of reducing the federal contribution and putting the

program  on  a  path  to  self-sustainability  that  will  ultimately  strengthen  it.  We  be-
lieve that the private sector contributions to the centers can be sustained; therefore,
we focused on reducing the administrative costs and grants from the FY 2005 level.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Charles E. McQueary, Under Secretary for Science and Technology, De-

partment of Homeland Security

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  Science  and  Technology  Direc-
torate  (S&T)  funds  academic  research  through  university  centers  of  excellence
and  fellowships  for  individual  students.  As  a  rule,  university  campuses  empha-
size  the  importance  of  publication  of  research  results.  How  does  DHS  balance
the  need  to  ensure  that  research  performed  at  DHS  centers  is  relevant  to  the
most  pressing  homeland  security  issues  with  the  importance  of  protecting  infor-
mation about vulnerabilities? Please describe DHS’s official policy for each uni-
versity center on access to sensitive or classified materials and on DHS pre-pub-
lication  review  of  research  results.  Is  this  policy  included  in  the  contract  lan-
guage?

A1. DHS  supports  the  open  conduct  and  publication  of  research  performed  by  the
Homeland Security Centers of Excellence. The Centers are generally able to conduct
their  grant-supported  research  without  access  to  sensitive  or  classified  information.
Where  such  information  is  necessary,  the  principal  investigators  are  subject  to  the
customary  background  checks  and  security  clearances.  The  Department  recognizes
that  open  research  may  indeed  expose  vulnerabilities  better  left  protected,  and  we
are  working  with  the  Centers  to  develop  guidelines  that  address  this  concern,  par-
ticularly as it relates to publication and dissemination of information. The Office of
Naval  Research,  which  acts  as  our  contracting  agent  in  these  matters,  covers  pos-
sible constraints on the policy of open publication in the grant terms and conditions
it issues.
Q2. Last year, DHS S&T adjusted its policies regarding how DHS S&T funding will

be provided to the Department of Energy (DOE) Laboratories.

Q2a. In  fiscal  year  2005  (FY05),  how  much  funding  has  been  provided  to  the  DOE
laboratories by DHS S&T? How were these projects selected as lab-appropriate
rather than industry-appropriate? Please provide examples.

A2a. For  Fiscal  Year  2005,  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  has  allocated
approximately $182 million in funding to the DOE national laboratories to date.

A consensus of the S&T Directorate’s executing offices (Office of Research and De-
velopment,  Homeland  Security  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  and  Systems
Engineering and Development) decides whether a program is to be based at the Na-
tional Laboratories by considering:

a. whether the work is inherently the Federal Government’s responsibility;
b. whether  the  work  is  required  to  maintain  an  enduring  national  capability;
c. whether limited interest in or incentive for private sector engagement creates

a technological or knowledge gap; and

d. whether  the  work  will  leverage  or  enhance  other  Federal,  State,  and  local

government investments.

The  research  directed  toward  the  Department’s  awareness  goal,  including  knowl-
edge discovery and dissemination and threat characterization, are examples of work
that meets these criteria. Such research develops capabilities in the acquisition and
interpretation  of  terrorist  threat  data  with  the  aim  of  providing  real-time  analysis
and information processing for policy makers, intelligence analysts, law enforcement
officials, human and animal health care communities, and other decision-makers.

• Creation  of  standards  and  test  protocols  for  various  types  of  equipment  for
use  in  guiding  industry  and  evaluating  technologies  against  minimum  per-
formance requirements.
• Establishing,  maintaining,  and  operating  test-bed  facilities  to  assess  the  per-
formance of technologies and technology systems provided by various industry
partners in operational environments encountered by DHS users.
• Establishing,  maintaining  and  operating  facilities  to  perform  research  on
• Creating  detailed  intra-  and  cross-sector  models  to  simulate  inter-depend-
encies in critical infrastructure, including sensitive information captured from
industrial and governmental ‘‘owners’’ of the sectors. The models then support

WMD forensics capabilities.

decisions  about  where  to  apply  technology  solutions  to  identified  gaps  and
vulnerabilities.

Q2b. In FY05, how much funding has been provided to the DOE laboratories by non-
S&T units of DHS? What role does S&T play is selecting the DOE laboratories
to  perform  this  work?  What  role  does  S&T  play  in  overseeing  the  projects?
Please provide examples.

A2b. As  of  mid-March,  the  Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection
(IAIP)  Directorate  indicates  that  approximately  $73  million  is  projected  to  be  allo-
cated  to  DOE  national  laboratories  in  Fiscal  Year  2005.  The  funding  from  IAIP  is
for  vulnerability  assessments  and  risk  analysis  from  an  operational  perspective.
IAIP  is  taking  advantage  of  the  knowledge  base  of  the  subject  matter  experts  resi-
dent  at  the  national  labs.  The  Bureau  of  Customs  and  Border  Protection  estimates
$96  million  will  be  allocated  to  the  DOE  national  laboratories.  The  Department’s
other  Directorates  select  performers  based  on  internal  criteria  suited  to  their  spe-
cific mission requirements and user needs. The Office of National Laboratories with-
in  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  facilitates  other  Directorates’  access  to
the national laboratories as appropriate.
Q2c. The  Homeland  Security  S&T  Advisory  Committee  reviewed  S&T’s  policy  and
existing interactions with the laboratories, and offered several recommendations
going  forward,  including  that  DHS  clarify  its  strategic  needs  from  the  labora-
tories,  consolidate  management  and  oversight  of  all  DHS-funded  work  at  the
labs,  and  explore  models  for  funding  the  labs  that  go  beyond  the  current
project-driven approach. What actions is DHS S&T taking in response to these
recommendations?

A2c. The  S&T  Directorate  values  the  Advisory  Committee’s  recommendations  and
is  actively  developing  a  strategy  to  implement  the  Advisory  Committee’s  concepts.
We  have  commissioned  a  study  by  the  Homeland  Security  Institute  to  develop  spe-
cific criteria, metrics, and methods that we could use to address the Advisory Com-
mittee’s  recommendations.  This  study  builds  on  the  Homeland  Security  Institute’s
previous examination of the national laboratories’ capabilities, and we expect the In-
stitute to complete its study later this year.
Q3. The  recent  tsunami  reminded  us  that  it  is  critical  for  every  community  to  have
an  effective  means  to  communicate  warnings  or  information  for  any  natural  or
man-made disaster to the public. It is our understanding that DHS received $10
million in fiscal year 2004 (FY04) and another $10 million in FY05 to purchase
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  Weather  Radios  to
be  placed  in  public  schools  across  the  Nation.  Has  any  of  the  funding  actually
been used to purchase and deploy the radios? If not, why not? And how are you
working with NOAA on this project?

A3. DHS  is  currently  procuring  NOAA  All-Hazard  radios  for  schools  across  the
country.  Following  extensive  coordination  with  NOAA,  the  Department  of  Edu-
cation,  and  other  DHS  entities,  a  $500,000  pilot  program  was  initiated  to  dissemi-
nate  these  radios  to  K–12  public  schools  in  certain  Urban  Area  Security  Initiative
(UASI)  cities  and  two  rural  states.  It  is  anticipated  that  these  radios  will  arrive  in
schools  before  the  end  of  this  school  year.  After  we  consider  lessons  learned  from
the  initial  pilot  program  $1.5  million  of  additional  alert  and  warning  funds  will  be
used, totaling $2 million for NOAA All-Hazard radio purchases. The remaining $18
million appropriated for alert and warning is being used for related efforts, such as
applying  satellite  technology  to  emergency  warning  of  natural  or  man-made  disas-
ters.

In  addition  to  weather-related  information,  DHS  and  NOAA  now  have  an  agree-
ment  for  NOAA’s  All-Hazard  broadcasts  to  complement  the  Federal  Emergency
Management  Agency’s  (FEMA)  local  Emergency  Alert  System.  This  allows  NOAA
All-Hazard radios to disseminate official DHS alert and warning information.
Q4. The  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002  requires  DHS  to  establish  a  Homeland  Se-
curity  Institute  (HSI)  to  provide  analytical  services,  including  risk  assessment
and  vulnerability  modeling.  A  contractor  for  HSI  was  selected  in  April  of  last
year.  What  is  the  funding  level  for  HSI  in  FY04  and  FY05  and  the  planned
funding level in FY06? What tasks has it accomplished to date? How does S&T
expect to use it going forward? Do other units of DHS have access to HSI’s capa-
bilities? How are those projects funded?

A4. The  Homeland  Security  Institute  (HSI),  a  Federally-Funded  Research  and  De-
velopment  Center  (FFRDC),  was  established  on  April  26,  2004,  to  be  a  strategic
analytic resource for DHS and provide the Department with the capabilities identi-

fied in Sec. 312 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The activities of the Institute
are  organized  into  core  tasks  (cross-cutting  work  to  address  strategic  issues  and
broader, longer-term research needs) and analytic tasks that focus on specific issues
or questions. Funding is provided to support both types of tasks consistent with the
Institute’s core capabilities.

In  FY  2004,  HSI  received  $9.0  million  from  the  S&T  Directorate  for  phase-in,
core,  and  analytic  tasks.  For  FY  2005,  the  S&T  Directorate  provided  $15.5  million
in core and analytic task funding. Other DHS components, including the Border and
Transportation  Security  Directorate,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  and  the  DHS  Chief  In-
formation Officer, have access to HSI’s capabilities and have provided or committed
approximately  $1.5  million  for  analytic  task  funding  in  FY  2005.  HSI  funding  for
FY  2006  is  in  the  planning  stages  and  will  be  determined  later  as  individual  DHS
elements identify their analytic needs. To date, the Institute completed all tasks as-
signed  in  the  FY  2004  Research  Plan,  is  underway  on  the  42  tasks  identified  for
the  FY  2005  Research  Plan,  and  is  developing  (along  with  DHS)  a  set  of  research
activities for possible FY 2006 funding.

The Homeland Security Institute’s core capabilities include systems analysis, risk-
consequence-vulnerability  analyses,  operational  and  capability  assessments,  multi-
faceted  threat  evaluations,  economic  and  policy  analysis,  alternative  investment
comparisons,  and  simulations.  The  Institute  also  sponsors  and  analyzes  outputs
from  meetings  and  workshops  on  topics  such  as  Wide  Area  Biological  Restoration,
Rail Security, and Cargo Security. These workshops bring together top experts from
the  public,  industry  and  academia,  along  with  the  Federal/State/local  government
sectors, including the national laboratories, to address specific critical issues and de-
velop  broad-based  priorities  that  can  drive  the  DHS  strategic  decision  processes.
HSI has also been working with various standards committees to help foster the de-
velopment  and  promote  community-wide  acceptance  of  homeland  security  related
standards. HSI is also involved with charting and assessing homeland security capa-
bilities  at  a  variety  of  national  laboratories.  The  Institute  is  currently  funded  to
evaluate  several  operational  systems  including  the  assessment  of  urban  bio-moni-
toring  methods.  These  kinds  of  analyses  provide  an  independent  focus  and  evalua-
tion process to the system assessments. HSI has also begun to work with other DHS
components,  including  the  Office  for  Domestic  Preparedness,  the  Information  Anal-
ysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection  Directorate  and  the  Office  of  Program  Analysis
and Evaluation.
Q5. On  page  22  of  your  testimony,  you  indicate  that  DHS  is  working  on  a  ‘‘ ‘Future
Smart  Container’  initiative  encompassing  container  security,  communications,
and  data  systems  for  the  future.’’  How  much  is  DHS  spending  on  this  program
in  FY05?  How  much  does  it  plan  to  spend  in  FY06?  What  are  the  priorities  for
container  security  research?  Should  we  be  focusing  on  near-term  solutions  or
more long-range research?

A5. In  support  of  the  Maritime  Security  Policy  National  Security/Homeland  Secu-
rity  Presidential  Directive  (NSPD–41/HSPD–13)  and  the  Maritime  Transportation
Security  Act  of  2002,  specifically  the  Container  Security  Initiative,  the  S&T  Direc-
torate  is  developing  both  short-  and  long-term  enhancements  to  container  security
under the auspices of the Cargo Security Program.

During  FY  2005  and  FY  2006,  the  majority  of  our  Cargo  Security  efforts  are  in
container security. The planned container security investment is $10.6 million in FY
2005  and  $12.0  million  in  FY  2006.  We  are  also  developing  other  aspects  of  cargo
security including communications and data management systems.

The longer-term priorities for cargo security research are:

• Assuring the integrity of container loading and documentation;
• Reducing risk of undetected tampering in transit;
• Providing  accurate,  complete,  timely,  and  protected  shipment  information;

and

• Enhancing supply chain efficiency.

DHS  is  working  towards  a  cargo  security  program  that  will  utilize  an  integrated
network system able to effectively and efficiently manage the large amounts of infor-
mation that come with the use of various types of sensors and technologies.
Q6. The  Electronic  Crimes  Task  Forces  (ECTFs)  of  the  Secret  Service  have  proven
to  be  effective  in  stopping  Information  Age  crimes  such  as  identity  theft,  cyber
terrorism  and  online  fraud.  Is  DHS  S&T  working  with  the  Secret  Service  and
the ECTFs on a research agenda for these areas?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00178 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

175

A6. The S&T Directorate is working with the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) to develop
requirements  for  research,  development,  testing,  and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  to  ad-
dress  identity  theft,  cyber  crimes,  online  fraud,  and  similar  issues.  Responding  to
needs  identified  by  internal  customers  within  the  USSS,  the  S&T  Directorate’s
Cyber Security RDT&E portfolio funded a project to develop a software tool for iden-
tifying certain types of Internet communications commonly used for illicit commerce
in  with  stolen  credit  card  numbers  and  related  data.  In  addition,  in  a  recent  pro-
posal  competition  that  included  seven  technical  topic  areas,  one  of  the  topic  areas
solicited  proposals  aimed  at  technologies  to  defend  against  identity  theft.  Several
members  of  the  USSS  participated  in  the  review  process  for  these  proposals,  some
of which concerned phishing (a form of cyber-based social engineering that uses mis-
representation  to  trick  users  into  divulging  sensitive  or  personal  information  which
is  then  used  for  identity  theft  or  other  fraud).  Three  projects  aimed  at  preventing
phishing were identified as meriting funding.
Q7. The  National  Institute  of  Justice  (NIJ)  Center,  co-located  at  the  Air  Force  Re-
search  Laboratory  Information  Directorate  at  Rome,  has  had  a  tremendous
record  of  leveraging  technologies  developed  by  the  military  and  transferring
these technologies to state and local law enforcement, particularly in the emerg-
ing  area  of  cyber  crime  and  cyber  terrorism.  What  is  DHS  doing  to  work  with
the  NIJ  to  assist  State  and  local  law  enforcement  with  new  and  emerging  tech-
nologies?

A7. The  S&T  Directorate’s  Office  for  Inter-operability  and  Compatibility  (OIC)  has
partnered  with  NIJ  on  a  number  of  initiatives,  and  their  representatives  serve  to-
gether on a number of committees to help the local and State law enforcement com-
munity.  Mutual  efforts  have  included  establishing  an  interagency  Memorandum  of
Agreement to coordinate and collaborate on the development of a process to transfer
technologies  and  equipment  to  emergency  responder  communities,  creation  of  a
Joint  Evaluation  and  Testing  (JET)  Program  for  public  safety  equipment,  and  NIJ
membership in OIC’s SAFECOM Advisory Group. Through the SAFECOM Advisory
Group,  NIJ  has  participated  in  development  of  the  Statewide  Communications
Inter-operability  Planning  (SCIP)  Methodology,  a  strategic  plan  for  statewide  com-
munications and inter-operability in Virginia, and a Public Safety Statement of Re-
quirements  for  Communications  and  Inter-operability  (SoR),  among  other  efforts.
State  and  local  law  enforcement  also  receive  assistance  with  new  and  emerging
technologies  through  the  Information  Analysis  and  Infrastructure  Protection  Direc-
torate  and  the  Office  of  State  and  Local  Government  Coordination  and  Prepared-
ness.  IAIP  provides  operational  assistance  for  new  technologies  and  OSLGCP  sup-
ports equipment acquisition.
Q8. On page 32 of your statement, within the ‘‘Office of SAFETY Act Implementation
(OSAI)’’  section,  you  note  that:  ‘‘The  number  of  applications  is  expected  to  in-
crease  significantly  with  the  introduction  of  the  revised  kit,  implementation  of
the  Final  Rule,  and  higher  visibility.’’  Additionally,  you  note  that:  ‘‘OSAI  plans
to expand its coordination of the program with pending federal, State and local
procurements.’’  Given  the  expectation  for  an  increased  workload  and  expanded
efforts,  what  is  the  justification  for  a  44  percent  decrease  in  the  OSAI  budget?
What  activities  will  be  cut?  What  is  the  personnel  level  for  OSAI  in  FY05,  and
what is the proposed personnel level for FY06?

A8. The Office of SAFETY Act Implementation was established in 2004–2005. Non-
recurring costs for the OSAI from that time include those associated with the devel-
opment  of  a  multi-stage  process  for  implementing  the  governing  regulation;  devel-
oping  and  refining  the  review  and  approval  process  and  for  training  and  certifying
reviewers;  securing  a  proper  a  facility  and  support  staff  to  house  the  OSAI  in  a
manner  guaranteed  to  protect  the  sensitive  proprietary  information;  establishing  a
network  of  technical  reviewers;  and  establishing  a  web-based  SAFETY  Act  applica-
tion submission, review, and approval mechanism.

Based  on  initial  assumptions  about  the  prospective  number  of  applications,  the
Department designed the program to have the capacity to process up to 1,000 appli-
cations  per  year.  However,  fewer  applications  than  expected  were  received.  We  ex-
pect that more Federal, State and local government contracting officers and industry
learn  of  its  benefits  and  we  fully  implement  measures  to  make  the  program  more
accessible, the number of applications will increase measurably.

Thus,  although  the  proposed  budget  for  FY  2006  has  been  reduced,  no  planned
SAFETY  Act  activities  will  be  cut  since  the  infrastructure,  application  process,  and
vetted  reviewers  are  now  in  place.  The  funding  stream  for  FY  2005  and  FY  2006
are sufficiently robust to accommodate significant increases in applications. We reit-
erate that it is our goal to integrate, to the maximum extent possible, SAFETY Act

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00179 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

176

protections with appropriate public procurements—federal, State, and local. As pro-
curement officials at all levels become aware of the benefits of integrating SAFETY
Act  protections  into  public  procurements,  we  anticipate  an  increase  in  the  number
of full applications.

In  FY05  the  staff  at  the  Office  of  SAFETY  Act  Implementation  included:  the  Di-
rector,  a  federal  detailee,  an  IPA  from  academia,  three  SETA  support  contractors,
and  a  core  staff  of  33  supplied  by  the  prime  contractor  FFRDC.  In  addition,  the
OSAI has established, through a support arrangement with a DOD FFRDC, the ca-
pability to reach out to more than 400 technical reviewers that can serve on an as-
needed  basis  as  evaluators  of  SAFETY  Act  applications.  This  capacity  allows  the
OSAI  to  ensure  a  strong  technical  and  scientific  basis  for  each  SAFETY  Act  deci-
sions  and  ample  surge  capability  without  maintaining  an  excessively  large  perma-
nent  staff.  Since  DHS  has  already  paid  the  non-recurring  start-up  costs  described
in  paragraph  one  and  we  have  been  able  to  realize  labor  savings  through  the  use
of  consulting  arrangements,  we  are  comfortable  in  projecting  a  44  percent  overall
decrease in operational cost.
Q9. On page 59 of your statement, within the ‘‘Office of SAFETY Act Implementation
(OSAI)’’  section,  you  note  that:  ‘‘the  S&T  Directorate  has  created  a  partnership
with federal procurement offices to introduce them to the program.’’ Please indi-
cate  when  this  partnership  was  launched,  list  the  federal  procurement  offices
that  are  members  of  this  partnership,  and  describe  what  this  partnership  has
accomplished  since  its  inception.  Furthermore,  please  list  the  procurements  that
have  been  considered  for  SAFETY  Act  coverage,  and  those  that  have  actually
been given SAFETY Act coverage, as part of this partnership effort.

A9. The  Department  and  the  Office  of  SAFETY  Act  Implementation  (OSAI)  will
continue  to  reach  out  proactively  to  inform  relevant  communities-first  responders;
State,  local,  and  tribal  agencies;  the  private  sector;  the  legal  profession;  federal
agencies; procurement and acquisitions officers-of the benefits and processes associ-
ated with the SAFETY Act. We realize that there is still a learning curve and that
additional efficiencies are possible. However, our overall goal is for procurement offi-
cials  at  the  federal,  State,  or  local  levels  to  identify  the  potential  for  SAFETY  Act
protections and contact the Office of SAFETY Act Implementation prior to the pub-
lic  solicitation.  OSAI  has  established  internal  procedures  to  flag  applications  sub-
mitted in connection with federal, State, and local procurements and expedite their
processing. The Department is also supporting on-going interagency efforts to asses
the  need  for  and  potential  development  of  modifications  to  the  Federal  Acquisition
Regulation in light of the SAFETY Act and Executive Order 13286. The Department
will  continue  to  listen  to  these  communities  for  ways  to  better  implement  the  Act.
OSAI has coordinated the timing of its review of SAFETY Act applications to accom-
modate  procurements  by  the  Transportation  Security  Administration,  Customs  and
Border Patrol, and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Q10. As  the  S&T  Directorate  operates,  maintains  and  deploys  the  BioWatch  pro-
gram,  please  describe  what,  if  any,  liability  risks  you  believe  the  government
faces should this system fail to work and harm come to the public. Also, please
describe  what  risk  management  systems  are  currently  in  place  to  mitigate  this
risk—i.e.,  do  contractors,  vendors,  or  suppliers  to  the  program  benefit  from  ei-
ther indemnification or SAFETY Act coverage? If not, what is the rationale for
this  lack  of  coverage?  Will  technologies  developed  for  the  next  generation  of
BioWatch equipment receive indemnification or SAFETY Act coverage?

A10. Government  liability  would  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of
sovereign immunity and its limited waiver in the Federal Tort Claims Act. However,
the  S&T  Directorate  believes  it  has  an  obligation  to  ensure  that  the  overall
BioWatch program works properly as a matter of public safety and public trust, re-
gardless of liability.

The  Department  is  not  aware  of  any  SAFETY  Act  application  submitted  in  con-
nection  with  the  BioWatch  program.  All  providers  of  anti-terrorism  technology  may
apply for the protections afforded by the SAFETY Act. Participants in the BioWatch
program are certainly eligible to apply.
Q11. What  is  the  status  of  the  new  DHS  partnership  with  the  Air  Force  Research
Laboratory  (AFRL)  in  Rome,  NY?  What  progress  has  been  made  toward  ex-
panding  DHS–AFRL  collaborations  in  specific  areas  since  the  agreement  was
signed last August? Also, please provide information on the objectives, timeline,
budget, and other plans related to the new agreement as it moves forward.

A11. AFRL  has  been  supporting  the  execution  of  some  of  the  S&T  Directorate’s
Cyber Security portfolio activities, serving as a funding agent for several of the port-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00180 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

177

folio’s programmatic activities. Though most of the funding goes out to external per-
formers, AFRL collects agent fees that support AFRL activities. AFRL is serving as
an  agent  for  approximately  $5.8  million  of  FY  2004  funds.  The  total  funding  level
for FY 2005 is expected to be somewhat lower due to reductions in some of our pro-
gram  budgets.  Additionally,  approximately  a  dozen  members  of  AFRL’s  technical
staff  served  on  the  review  panel  for  a  broad  agency  announcement  (BAA)  recently
released by the S&T Directorate.

Within  the  S&T  Directorate,  the  SAFECOM  Program  is  in  the  process  of  devel-
oping  a  Statement  of  Work  for  Technical  Support  related  to  the  Program’s  efforts
to research and develop communications and information inter-operability standards
important to public safety readiness for day-to-day operations, including counter-ter-
rorism readiness. The Statement of Work would leverage AFRL’s expertise in infor-
mation  technology  (particularly  in  inter-operability,  connectivity,  information  shar-
ing, and data fusion) to perform R&D related to project SAFECOM. The Statement
of  Work  is  still  being  developed  and  is  expected  to  be  submitted  for  review  or  ap-
proval within the Department in FY 2005. It is anticipated that the level of invest-
ment that will fund R&D at AFRL will be $2–$2.5 million, although funds have not
yet been obligated.

Questions submitted by Representative Dave G. Reichert
Q1. Washington  State  is  home  to  one  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  premier
science laboratories, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Rich-
land,  WA.  Although  not  in  my  district,  the  Lab  supports  a  robust  program  for
DHS,  including  your  Science  &  Technology  Directorate,  that  has  important  re-
gional and national impacts. Indeed, as you know, PNNL has unmatched capa-
bilities in detecting radiological materials.
The  President’s  FY  2006  budget  submission  announces  a  new  initiative  within
DHS called the Domestic Nuclear Defense Organization. Can you explain to the
Committee how this new organization will fit into DHS’s existing structure, and
how it will affect ongoing research efforts such as the radiological detection work
conducted at PNNL?

A1. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is a jointly-staffed, national of-
fice charged with developing a global nuclear detection architecture and with imple-
menting  the  domestic  portion  of  that  system.  The  system  will  detect  and  report  at-
tempts  to  import  or  transport  nuclear  devices,  fissile,  or  radiological  material  in-
tended for illicit use. DNDO reports directly to the Secretary of DHS.

The Department of Energy provides staff to DNDO to coordinate work and ensure
that the national laboratories, including PNNL, receive clear guidance and direction
on  efforts  regarding  the  global  nuclear  detection  architecture.  The  national  labora-
tories  have  long  been  this  nation’s  source  of  critical  nuclear  expertise.  That  exper-
tise will continue to be vital in responding to the threat of nuclear and radiological
attack.
Q2. The Volpentest HAMMER Training and Education Center in Richland, WA and
Lockheed  Martin  will  be  conducting  several  demonstrations  of  combined  com-
puter-based  simulation  and  hands-on  training  and  exercises  for  emergency  re-
sponders this year.

Q2a. Will you encourage appropriate representatives from DHS to observe these dem-
onstrations and seriously consider supporting this combined training and exer-
cise pilot project starting next year?

A2a. During  the  last  year,  I  visited  the  Volpentest  HAMMER  Facility,  and  I  will
ensure  that  the  S&T  Directorate  encourages  representatives  from  DHS  to  observe
these  demonstrations.  Information  provided  by  these  demonstrations  could  provide
valuable insight to the RDT&E needed in the area of simulation-based training and
exercise which is a major thrust for the S&T Directorate’s Emergency Preparedness
and Response (EP&R) RDT&E portfolio.
Q2b. Will  DHS  cooperate  with  DOE  to  develop  a  strategy  and  a  cooperative  agree-
ment to ensure that HAMMER remains available to meet DHS’s growing train-
ing  needs  for  emergency  responders;  law  enforcement,  customs,  border  protec-
tion,  and  security  personnel,  along  with  serving  as  a  test  bed  to  deploy  new
field technologies?

A2b. We  want  to  thank  Representative  Reichert  for  bringing  these  capabilities  of
the Volpentest HAMMER Facility to our attention and we will ensure we take them
into consideration.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Dr.  McQueary,  with  the  knowledge  that  a  cyber  attack  on  our  nation’s  govern-
ment computers could have devastating consequences for financial networks and
the  economy  and/or  could  result  in  the  theft  of  classified  documents  and  sen-
sitive personal information, why is it that cyber security still suffers from a lack
of  coordination,  poor  communication  and  an  inability  to  set  priorities  at  DHS?
What is the rationale for the requested $1.3 million cut to cyber security?

A1. The  National  Cyber  Security  Division  in  the  Information  Analysis  and  Infra-
structure  Protection  (IAIP)  Directorate  has  the  lead  on  cyber  security  issues.  DHS
is  following  the  priorities  set  forth  in  the  National  Strategy  to  Secure  Cyberspace.
S&T Directorate staff meet regularly with internal stakeholders in the Department’s
National  Cyber  Security  Division  and  the  National  Communications  System  to  un-
derstand  operational  requirements  better.  At  an  interagency  level,  the  S&T  Direc-
torate’s  Director  of  Cyber  Security  R&D  co-chairs  (with  the  Office  of  Science  and
Technology  Policy)  the  Critical  Information  Infrastructure  Protection  Interagency
Working  Group  (CIIP  IWG)  within  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council.
The CIIP IWG is working with numerous representatives from other federal depart-
ments and agencies to develop a coordinated interagency federal plan for cyber secu-
rity R&D.

We  believe  that  our  investment  balance  among  the  various  technical  portfolios  is
appropriate.  The  allocation  of  funding  resources  to  portfolios  is  based  on  a  formal
strategic  planning  process  that  takes  into  consideration  risk  (including  threat,  vul-
nerability,  and  consequence)  and  other  strategic  objectives.  Cyber  security  R&D
competes with other investments, and we believe its funding is appropriate. The De-
partment  has  been  highly  supportive  of  the  planning  approach  taken  by  the  S&T
Directorate  and  believes  that  this  process  results  in  technically  sound  and  support-
able decision making with regard to funding allocations.
Q2. The  S&T  Directorate  proposes  to  spend  $110  million  on  its  efforts  to  deal  with
the  threat  to  commercial  aircraft  posed  by  shoulder-fired  anti-aircraft  missiles,
such  as  Stingers.  The  RAND  Corporation  earlier  this  year  calculated  that  in-
stalling  existing  technology  on  the  commercial  air  fleet  would  cost  an  estimated
$11 billion and require a continuing annual maintenance investment of $2.1 bil-
lion. It also recommended proceeding with the Department’s R&D effort.

Q2a. How does the Directorate’s proposed program address the concern that the cur-
rent  technology  involves  annual  operating  costs  ($2.1  billion)  equal  to  almost
half  of  the  current  annual  spending  ($4.4  billion)  on  ALL  aspects  of  transpor-
tation security?

A2a. The  DHS  Counter–MANPADS  program  was  established  to  determine  the  fea-
sibility and economic viability of potential counter-measures systems on commercial
aircraft  including  the  key  issue  of  reliability  and  how  it  impacts  annual  operating
and  support  costs.  The  commercial  airline  industry  is  very  sensitive  to  operating
and  support  costs  and  advocates  the  lowest  cost  impact  possible  if  a  counter–
MANPADS  solution  is  implemented.  The  $2.1  billion  annual  operating  cost  identi-
fied by RAND in their report was derived from direct application of current military
systems  and  therefore  represents  a  high  upper  bound  of  the  cost  impact  for  the
Counter–MANPADS solutions currently being developed and demonstrated for com-
mercial adaptation. A number of promising advancements in operational and main-
tenance concepts could reduce the cost of operations. Some of these include reducing
the  requirements  of  Minimal  Equipment  List  (MEL),  utilizing  commercial  supply
chain  management  and  increasing  the  system’s  reliability.  One  of  the  primary
thrusts  of  the  DHS  Counter–MANPADS  program  is  to  increase  the  reliability  of
these  solutions  to  a  minimum  threshold  of  3,000  hours,  with  an  ultimate  target  of
4,500  hours.  While  these  are  challenging  goals,  if  the  objectives  of  the  DHS
Counter–MANPADS  program  are  met,  the  annual  operating  costs  would  be  signifi-
cantly reduced.

Additionally, the RAND report based its annual operating cost estimate on equip-
ping  6,800  total  aircraft,  which  includes  all  U.S.  airline  passenger,  and  cargo  wide-
body, narrow-body, and regional jet aircraft. While a decision has not yet been made
whether  to  equip  even  a  portion  of  the  fleet,  equipping  a  more  limited  number  of
aircraft  (e.g.,  wide-body  passenger  aircraft)  would  further  reduce  installation  and
annual operating costs compared with RAND’s estimate.

We  believe  that  the  DHS  System  Program  Office  assumptions  and  resultant  cost
estimates  will  be  a  more  accurate  reflection  of  the  current  status  of  the  program,
and  the  potential  annual  operating  costs  are  expected  to  be  reported  to  Congress
in the second quarter of FY 2006.

Q2b. The RAND report also recommends a ‘‘concurrent technology development effort
on understanding damage mechanisms and the likelihood of catastrophic dam-
age  to  airliners  from  an  attack.’’  Are  efforts  underway  within  your  program  to
address these recommendations?

A2b. The  S&T  Directorate  supports  this  report’s  recommendation  to  examine  the
damage  mechanisms  and  likelihood  of  catastrophic  damage  to  commercial  aircraft.
We  believe  this  is  important  information  to  include  in  the  decision  process  for  de-
ployment of countermeasures on commercial aircraft. The DHS Counter–MANPADS
System  Program  Office  is  working  closely  with  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD),
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration  (NASA)  to  establish  coordinated  efforts  to  assess  the  vulnerability
of large commercial aircraft and their associated infrastructure and to develop capa-
bilities  to  mitigate  the  vulnerabilities  identified.  These  efforts  will  include  dem-
onstration of new technologies that will reduce the likelihood of catastrophic damage
regardless  of  threat  type.  The  Counter–MANPADS  program  is  designed  to  advance
a  countermeasures  design  to  protect  commercial  aircraft  from  shoulder-launched
missiles;  this  program  is  not  intended  to  be  a  comprehensive  technology  develop-
ment effort to understand and mitigate damage mechanisms.

The  specific  charter  of  the  DHS  Counter–MANPADS  program  is  to  advance  a
countermeasures  design  that  will  protect  commercial  aircraft  from  shoulder-
launched  missiles.  However,  we  understand  that  the  types  of  information  rec-
ommended  in  the  RAND  report  are  important  for  inclusion  in  the  decision-making
process  for  deployment  of  countermeasures  on  commercial  aircraft.  The  DHS
Counter–MANPADS System Program Office is working closely with the Department
of  Defense  (DOD),  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA),  and  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish coordinated efforts to as-
sess  the  vulnerability  of  large  commercial  aircraft  and  their  associated  infrastruc-
ture  and  to  develop  capabilities  to  mitigate  the  vulnerabilities  identified.  These  ef-
forts  will  include  demonstration  of  new  technologies  that  will  reduce  the  likelihood
of catastrophic damage regardless of threat type.
Q2c. How significant is the false-alarm rate for current technology?
A2c. The  false  alarm  rate  of  current  sensor  technology  is  an  important  consider-
ation  and  its  reduction  is  a  primary  objective  of  the  current  DHS  Counter–
MANPADS  Program.  The  false  alarm  rate  is  far  more  critical  for  expendable-based
systems because of the potential impact of dispensing expendable flares in a civilian
environment  and  for  the  prevention  of  depleting  the  flares  unnecessarily.  The  con-
sequences  of  firing  a  laser  (e.g.,  Directed  InfraRed  Countermeasure  (DIRCM)  sys-
tems) in response to a false alarm are less than a launched flare, but are not with-
out  potential  impacts.  One  is  the  possibility  of  exposure  of  maintenance  personnel
to laser energy while the aircraft is on the ground. This can be prevented with safe-
ty  interlocks  and  control  logic  designed  for  the  civilian  environment.  Another  is
transmitting an Emergency Ground Notification (EGN) when a missile warning has
been  issued.  Methods  of  managing  an  EGN  during  false  alarms  are  being  explored
in Phase Two of the Counter–MANPADS program and will be integrated and tested
during Phase Three.

Perhaps of more concern than the false alarm rate of the sensors is the false noti-
fication  rate  of  system  reporting.  An  Emergency  Ground  Notification  report  by  the
system could potentially trigger a number of national, State, and local responses to
a  potential  MANPADS  event.  DHS  has  established  a  requirement  that  Counter–
MANPADS systems must have a false notification rate of fewer than one in one mil-
lion flights (current DHS threshold). Both of the DHS Counter–MANPADS Program
contractor  teams  are  implementing  a  number  of  processes  and  algorithms  that  will
filter out sensor false alarms and result in system designs that will meet or exceed
the DHS requirement. Future technologies currently in development with DOD may
be candidates for insertion to reduce false alarms further.
Q2d. Are  there  ground-based  detection  and  interception  technologies  that  could  be
put  in  place,  given  that  attacks  are  likely  to  occur  in  the  vicinity  of  airports?
A2d. When  the  Directorate  released  its  initial  Counter–MANPADS  Program  solici-
tation in October 2003 it was open to all potential solutions, whether ground-based
or aircraft-based. No company proposed a sufficiently mature ground-based solution.
There are a number of ground-based technologies that are presently under develop-
ment within DOD but none have been fielded or tested for use in a civilian environ-
ment. The Directorate is working closely with DOD to monitor progress in this area.
Once  DOD  has  matured  ground-based  technology  to  meet  its  own  military  oper-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00183 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

180

ational  requirements,  the  Directorate  will  investigate  the  applicability  of  this  tech-
nology in a civilian environment.
Q2e. What  assistance  are  you  providing  to  help  with  securing  the  perimeters  of  air-

ports, keeping these weapons out of range of commercial aircraft?

A2e. The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  has  the  lead  within  DHS
for airport security. TSA is working closely with the FBI, local law enforcement, and
the  respective  airport  authorities  to  assess  and  mitigate  the  vulnerability  of  com-
mercial  airports  to  MANPADS  and  other  standoff  weapons  attacks.  TSA  has  per-
formed  numerous  airport  vulnerability  assessments  in  and  around  airports  to  iden-
tify  potential  MANPADS  launch  areas.  During  FY  2005,  TSA  has  completed  18
MANPADS  Vulnerability  Assessments,  with  an  additional  14  scheduled.  TSA  has
also  developed  local  MANPADS  mitigation  plans  that  include  the  emergency  re-
sponse  activities  of  all  affected  federal,  State,  and  local  agencies.  TSA  conducts
MANPADS  exercises  and  outreach  efforts  to  validate  mitigation  plans  and  enhance
situational  awareness  and  education  for  local  law  enforcement  agencies  that  help
protect airports against this threat.

The  S&T  Directorate  is  currently  charged  with  researching,  developing,  testing,
and  evaluating  commercial  aircraft  anti-missile  technologies.  The  Directorate  is
working  with  TSA,  FAA,  and  law  enforcement  to  establish  the  reporting  require-
ments of the Counter–MANPADS System so that the system will support and inte-
grate  within  the  existing  and  future  security  architecture  of  the  Nation’s  airports
and  the  National  Airspace  System.  The  S&T  Directorate  and  TSA  coordinate  on
overlapping issues and areas of concern where they apply to improving civil aviation
security.
Q2f. The  RAND  report  recommended  postponing  installation  of  the  current  genera-

tion of these technologies. Do you agree with that conclusion?

A2f. The findings of the RAND Report are largely consistent with the reasons Con-
gress  established  the  DHS  Counter–MANPADS  program.  The  S&T  Directorate’s
Counter–MANPADS  Program  is  focused  on  migrating  proven  DOD  technologies  to
the  commercial  aviation  environment.  Efforts  to  transition  this  military  equipment
to  civilian  use  face  several  technical  and  programmatic  challenges  ranging  from  af-
fordability  and  flight  safety  to  aircraft  structural  impacts  across  a  wide  variety  of
equipment employed by the airline industry.

The decision to install any Counter–MANPADS system in the commercial aircraft
environment  will  ultimately  depend  on  balancing  risks  with  cost  and  performance.
In  order  to  assess  performance,  the  Directorate  has  proposed  to  maintain  the
progress  of  the  current  Counter–MANPADS  efforts  and  recommends  providing  the
requested  funding  for  FY  2006.  This  investment  would  allow  building  and  fielding
a  limited  number  of  additional  prototypes,  conducting  live  fire  testing,  improving
system  reliability  and  annual  operating  cost,  and  continuing  to  mature  and  adapt
the technology for commercial application.
Q3. The  Directorate  intends  to  expand  the  BioWatch  program.  It  currently  operates
in  some  30  metropolitan  areas,  according  to  the  budget  submission.  How  many
additional regions will be covered, and how will they be selected?

A3. The  current  plan  will  expand  coverage  in  the  top  threat  cities  rather  than  in-
crease the number of cities covered. This decision was based on stakeholder requests
for  increased  temporal  and  spatial  coverage  both  indoors  and  outdoors  in  high
threat areas, including transit facilities. In FY 2004, this architecture was deployed
in  pilot  form  to  New  York  City.  The  expanded  system  will  be  deployed  in  FY  2005
and FY 2006 and will include additional collectors and an enhanced laboratory capa-
bility to accommodate the resulting increases in sample load. Future generations of
BioWatch  detection  technology  may  reduce  both  the  installation  and  maintenance
costs, facilitating a wider coverage area.
Q4. The  newest  Scientific  American  has  an  article  titled,  ‘‘If  Smallpox  Strikes  Port-
land.’’  The  authors  describe  a  computer  simulation  that  looks  at  the  spread  of
a  biological  agent  through  a  city  to  study  the  most  effective  responses  by  public
health  authorities.  They  conclude  that  ‘‘. . .time  was  by  far  the  most  important
factor  in  limiting  deaths. . ..  The  actual  response  strategy  chosen  made  little
difference  compared  with  the  time  element.’’  How  does  the  BioWatch  program
contribute to minimizing the time between detection of a threat and decisions by
public health authorities on the most effective response?

A4. Prior  to  BioWatch,  health  authorities  relied  on  traditional  epidemiological
tools—primarily  dependent  on  clinical  signs  of  illness—to  make  public  health  re-
sponse  decisions.  BioWatch  offers  a  new  early  detection  capability  that  can  alert

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:34 Jul 12, 2005 Jkt 098563 PO 00000 Frm 00184 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\021605\98563.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

181

public  health  authorities  to  a  biological  terrorist  attack  before  exposed  people  show
clinical signs of illness. This allows public health authorities time to give an exposed
population  post-event  prophylaxis  before  the  onset  of  disease,  thus  increasing  sur-
vival  rates.  Current  RDT&E  efforts  are  underway  to  develop  sensors  that  signifi-
cantly reduce the time between the release of an agent and its detection. These im-
provements will further reduce the consequences of a bioterrorism attack.
Q5. The  Biological  Countermeasures  program,  of  which  BioWatch  is  a  component,
is one of the elements at DHS that was subjected to a Program Assessment Rat-
ing Tool (PART) evaluation. The PART analysis notes that ‘‘. . .during the ini-
tial  execution  of  new  programs  and  development  of  financial  processes,  there
have  been  delays  in  FY04  execution.  The  Biological  Countermeasures  program
inherited  a  variety  of  distinct  funds  in  the  FY03  transition  coupled  with  carry-
over  into  FY04.’’  What  progress  has  been  made  in  dealing  with  these  transition
events?

Q5a. The  Standards  portfolio  also  received  a  PART  evaluation  in  this  budget  cycle,
earning  only  an  ‘‘adequate’’  rating.  This  translated  directly  into  a  $3  million
decrease in the portfolio’s budget request. Yet from your testimony the portfolio
seems  to  be  as  active  and  successful  as  other  Directorate  elements.  What  rep-
resents the distinction between an ‘‘effective’’ and ‘‘adequate’’ program?

Q5b. The  Standards  portfolio’s  PART  analysis  shows  the  weakness  in  the  portfolio
to  be  the  lack  of  independent  evaluation  of  the  program’s  success.  Yet  it  states
that  this  occurred  because  there  hasn’t  been  an  independent  evaluation  of  the
portfolio  because  it’s  too  new.  Isn’t  this  a  bit  punitive,  even  for  the  Office  of
Management and Budget?

A5a,b. The Biological Countermeasures Portfolio provided transition information for
FY 2003 and FY 2004 in support of the PART evaluation. While the program is still
implementing  a  number  of  activities  funded  in  FY  2003  and  FY  2004,  the  pace  of
expenditures is increasing steadily.

PART evaluation scores are translated into qualitative ratings as described below:

Rating Range: Numerical Scores from 0–100
Effective: 85–100
Moderately Effective: 70–84
Adequate: 50–69
Ineffective: 0–49

The  focus  of  the  PART  program  is  to  encourage  continued  evaluation  and  im-
provement.  The  PART  evaluation  for  the  Standards  Program  identified  specific
areas to focus on for improvement. The S&T Directorate is addressing these identi-
fied  areas  for  improvement  and  expects  the  next  PART  evaluation  to  improve.  It
should be noted that the PART score strongly emphasizes demonstrated progress on
annual  and  long-term  performance  measures.  Newer  programs  that  lack  such  will
have somewhat lower PART scores until they develop a track record of performance.
The  funding  change  for  the  Standards  Program  was  not  a  result  of  the  PART
evaluation. Multiple factors are considered in identifying the recommended funding
including  risk,  needs,  and  the  prioritization  of  the  total  S&T  Directorate’s  efforts.
The PART evaluation is not intended to be punitive; it is intended to identify spe-
cific areas to focus on to achieve program improvement. The Standards Program did
not  have  evaluations  in  place  at  the  time  of  the  PART  evaluation;  thus,  the  state-
ment  that  the  program  did  not  have  independent  evaluations  of  its  program  is  a
correct  statement.  However,  the  PART  evaluation  also  noted  that  the  reason  the
Standards  Program  did  not  have  independent  evaluations  in  place  was  the  fact  it
was a new program.
Q6. The  S&T  Directorate  will  be  conducting  R&D  on  advanced  detectors  for  chem-
ical and nuclear materials. What improvements over current detector technology
are expected to result from this program?

A6. The S&T Directorate is currently engaged in a wide variety of programs to pro-
vide  additional  capabilities  for  nuclear  detection.  The  scope  of  these  efforts  spans
from near-term product improvements that address immediate operational needs, to
the  development  of  next-generation  capabilities,  to  foundational  science  to  enable
the development of entirely new detection capabilities. Improvements expected from
the  overall  nuclear  detection  R&D  program  include  increased  detector  sensitivities,
decreased  scan  times  for  higher  detector  through-put,  ruggedization  of  equipment
for  unique  operational  deployments,  decreased  overall  cost  of  ownership,  and  re-
duced labor required to operate the equipment.

182

For  chemical  detection,  the  S&T  Directorate  is  focusing  its  efforts  on  improving
both detection performance and operational utility for detect-to-warn and emergency
responder applications. Current chemical sensors tend to give false positive readings
in  real-world  use,  are  unable  to  detect  low  vapor  pressure  chemicals,  and  require
multiple detection systems to cover a broad range of potential chemical threats. The
S&T  Directorate’s  RDT&E  efforts  are  focused  on  developing  sensors  with  broader
range (including low vapor threat agents) and lower false positive rates that can be
integrated  into  a  single  detector.  We  have  ongoing  projects  both  to  develop  near-
term  solutions  for  detect-to-warn  capabilities  and  for  emergency  responders  and  to
provide more optimal solutions over the longer term.
Q7. This  committee  has  long  been  concerned  about  the  balance  between  short-  and
long-term  research  and  the  tendency  of  agencies  to  focus  resources  on  develop-
ment  at  the  expense  of  research.  Your  testimony  notes  that  basic  research  is
earning  a  higher  percentage  of  the  Directorate’s  proposed  budget  for  FY  2006,
but that is after it slipped backwards between FY 2004 and FY 2005.

Q7a. What  criteria  do  you  use  to  evaluate  whether  the  Directorate  is  devoting  ade-

quate resources to basic research?

A7a. The  S&T  Directorate  has  a  formal  risk-based  strategic  planning  process  (in-
cluding  threat,  vulnerability,  and  consequence)  that  identifies  critical  areas  of  need
for  RDT&E.  This  process  identifies  both  short-  and  long-term  research  needs  that
are  required  to  meet  our  strategic  objectives  in  support  of  securing  the  homeland.
The S&T Directorate evaluates whether it is devoting adequate resources to basic
research  first  by  taking  into  account  opportunities  to  leverage  basic  research  con-
ducted  by  others  to  maximize  efficiency.  The  S&T  Directorate  then  identifies  the
gaps  in  basic  research  that  appear  to  be  most  relevant  to  the  homeland  security
mission and assesses whether our applied and developmental efforts have sufficient
basic  information  to  facilitate  RDT&E  to  secure  the  homeland.  Because  basic  re-
search  programs  typically  have  a  longer  timeline  than  applied  and  developmental
programs,  it  is  essential  that  the  S&T  Directorate  always  has  a  stable  basic  re-
search  program  in  areas  relevant  to  the  Department’s  and  the  S&T  Directorate’s
strategic objectives.
Q7b. How  does  the  Directorate’s  priority-setting  process  deal  with  the  tension  be-

tween short- and long-term needs when making investment decisions?

A7b. The  S&T  Directorate’s  strategic  planning  process  uses  a  risk-based  approach
(including threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences) that identifies critical areas of
need  for  RDT&E.  The  potential  impact  of  RDT&E  investments  is  evaluated  and
those efforts, both short- and long-term, that will have the greatest impact on reduc-
ing risk are pursued.

In  the  two  years  that  this  Department  has  been  in  existence,  the  Science  and
Technology Directorate has focused its efforts on near-term development and deploy-
ment of technologies to improve our nation’s ability to detect and respond to poten-
tial  terrorist  acts.  However,  we  recognize  that  a  sustained  effort  to  continually  add
to  our  knowledge  base  and  our  resource  base  is  necessary  for  future  developments.
Thus,  we  have  invested  a  portion  of  our  resources,  including  our  university  pro-
grams,  toward  these  objectives.  The  following  table  indicates  our  expenditures  in
basic research, applied research, and development to date.

183

Our  expenditures  in  basic  research  are  heavily  weighted  by  our  investments  in
university programs. These university programs will not only provide new informa-
tion  relevant  to  homeland  security,  but  will  also  provide  a  workforce  of  people  who
are cognizant of the needs of homeland security, especially in areas of risk analysis,
animal-related  agro-terrorism,  bioforensics,  cyber  security,  disaster  modeling,  and
psychological and behavioral analysis.
Q7c. What is the likely trend in the Directorate’s support for basic research over the

next decade?

A7c. In FY 2004 and FY 2005, as well as the budget request for FY 2006, the allo-
cation  for  basic  research  has  been  maintained  at  approximately  8c  percent  of  the
total S&T Directorate’s RDT&E budget. We plan to increase the allocation for basic
research to over 10 percent in future years.
Q8. One  of  the  Department’s  first  University  Centers  of  Excellence,  the  Center  for
Risk  and  Economic  Analysis  of  Terrorism  Events  at  the  University  of  Southern
California,  is  receiving  $12  million  over  three  years  ‘‘to  evaluate  the  risks,  costs
and  consequences  of  terrorism  and  to  guide  economically  viable  investments  in
countermeasures,’’  according  to  your  testimony.  It  would  seem  that  their  work
would  be  invaluable  to  you  in  setting  priorities  for  the  Directorate  and  evalu-
ating the requests for support you receive from the Department or other agencies.
What  results  have  you  received  to  date  from  our  investment  in  this  Center,  and
how  are  they  contributing  to  the  work  of  the  Directorate’s  Office  of  Plans,  Pro-
grams and Budget?

A8. The  University  of  Southern  California  Homeland  Security  Center  for  Risk  and
Economic  Analysis  of  Terrorism  Events  has  been  in  existence  for  just  one  year.  A
number of significant studies and analyses are well underway at the Center.

The Center and its consortium partners are developing modeling capabilities that
cut  across  general  threats  and  targets,  represented  by  application  areas  such  as
electrical  power,  transportation  and  telecommunications.  The  Homeland  Security
Center  is  also  developing  tools  for  planning  responses  to  emergencies  in  order  to
minimize  the  threat  to  human  lives  and  reduce  the  economic  impact  in  the  event
of  an  attack.  The  HS  Center  works  closely  with  DHS  to  prioritize  key  research
areas, and it also provides relevant educational programs. The grant allows the HS
Center to pursue research and development and educational programs in accordance
with DHS priorities. This will provide the Department with peer-reviewed, scientif-
ically  validated  assessments  and  models  and  independent  technical  expert  advice.
Q9. You  state  in  your  testimony  that  ‘‘[a]bout  60  percent  of  the  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Directorate’s  appropriation  in  FY  2005  will  be  executed  directly  through
the private sector, with HSARPA managing about 40 percent of that.’’ This com-
mittee  has  jurisdiction  over  another  agency  that  executes  much  of  its  mission
through the private sector. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA)  has  been  prominent  on  the  Government  Accountability  Office  high-risk
list  for  contract  management  problems  for  more  than  a  decade.  How  does  the
Directorate  plan  to  maintain  the  cadre  of  qualified  program  managers  it  will

need  to  assure  that  its  R&D  efforts  do  not  end  up  sharing  NASA’s  problems  in
this area?

A9. The S&T Directorate recognizes the need for acquiring and maintaining a cadre
of  qualified  program  managers.  The  S&T  Directorate’s  current  program  managers
are  senior  staff  with  demonstrated  program  management  effectiveness,  not  only  in
their work to date with the S&T Directorate, but also in their prior service in other
government  agencies,  private  industry,  and  academia.  The  S&T  Directorate  con-
tinues  to  recruit  highly-qualified  program  managers  and  to  support  the  continued
development  of  current  program  managers  through  training.  In  addition,  the  S&T
Directorate  conducts  program  reviews  to  ensure  that  expected  results  are  being
achieved. Any deficiencies in program progress will be identified and addressed, in-
cluding  any  deficiencies  that  would  be  attributable  to  program  management.  The
S&T  Directorate  continues  to  place  high  emphasis  on  its  program  management  re-
sponsibilities, including acquiring and maintaining qualified program managers.

INSERT FOR THE RECORD FROM DR. SAMUEL W. BODMAN IN RESPONSE TO

REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

The  following  information  for  the  record  was  submitted  by  Dr.  Samuel  W.
Bodman,  in  response  to  a  question  asked  by  Representative  Jerry  F.  Costello  (see
page 123).

The  competitive  solicitation  for  site  selection  will  be  issued  approximately  three
months  after  the  FutureGen  cooperative  agreement  with  our  industry  partners  is
signed.  We  anticipate  that  site  selection  will  be  completed  within  18  to  24  months
after  the  signing  of  the  cooperative  agreement.  The  site  selection  will  be  a  fair  and
open competitive process that would evaluate each of the proposed sites on its mer-
its  against  a  set  of  technical  and  environmental  (National  Environmental  Policy
Act—NEPA) criteria.
