NOMINATION  OF  HON.  RAY  LAHOOD 

TO  BE  SECRETARY  OF  THE 

U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  TRANSPORTATION 

WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY  21,  2009, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:05  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Senator  John  D. 
Rockefeller, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

The CHAIRMAN. The meeting will come to—the hearing will come 
to  order.  I  want  to  start  out  my  chairmanship  by  yielding  to  John 
Kerry who has a 30-minute, maybe 30-hour or 30-second announce-
ment he wants to make. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator  KERRY.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appre-
ciate  the  privilege.  I’m  managing  the  nomination  on  the  floor  so  I 
need to leave. 

I just wanted to welcome you as Chairman. We’re delighted that 
you’re  going  to  be  taking  the  helm  of  this  Committee.  We  know 
your passion for all of the issues in front of the Committee. 

And just personally, as somebody who’s shared this journey with 
you  on  the  Committee,  I’m  delighted  that  you’ve  taken  on  the 
gavel.  And  I  look  forward  to  your  leadership.  It’s  good  to  be  here 
with you. 

I  want  to  welcome  our  new  Senators  also.  It’s  great  to  have  all 
them here. And I would ask unanimous consent that my full state-
ment be placed in the record as if read in full. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Kerry follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN KERRY, U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 
Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  and  welcome  Congressman  LaHood.  In  your  fourteen 
years  serving  the  constituents  of  Illinois’  18th  District,  you  built  a  record  that  has 
won  you  the  respect  of  colleagues  across  party  lines  for  your  commitment  to  pur-
suing the best policy solutions regardless of party affiliation. 

At  a  time  when  our  physical  infrastructure  is  in  desperate  need  of  repair,  our 
crowded skies are in need of a navigation system fit for 21st century air travel, and 
our  collective  thinking  on  transportation  policy  must  account  for  the  increasing  ef-
fects  of  global  climate  changing,  I  am  hopeful  that  you  will  bring  a  breath  of  fresh

air  to  an  agency  that  will  be  at  the  center  of  an  infrastructure  revolution  in  this 
country. 

Despite the onslaught of bad financial news, we all have the privilege to live and 
work  and  travel  in  the  most  prosperous  nation  in  the  world.  But  travel  by  train  in 
this country, you’d never know it. 

Meanwhile,  traffic  congestion  continues  to  worsen  in  American  cities  of  all  sizes, 
creating a $78 billion drain on the U.S. economy in the form of 4.2 billion lost hours 
and  2.8  billion  gallons  of  wasted  fuel.  In  2007,  domestic  flight  delays  cost  the  U.S. 
economy  $41  billion  and  consumed  about  740  million  additional  gallons  of  jet  fuel 
according to the Joint Economic Committee. 

As  part  of  the  upcoming  debate  on  economic  stimulus,  we’re  preparing  to  make 
a massive investment in this country’s infrastructure. In my mind, that investment 
has  to  come  with  a  commitment  to  the  transportation  infrastructure  that  will  help 
us become cleaner and more efficient travelers in this next American century. I look 
forward to hearing your thoughts on what that commitment should look like. 

I  also  look  forward  to  hearing  your  view  on  the  Administration’s  commitment  to 
implementing the CAFE standards adopted as part of the Energy Independence and 
Security Act. I originally introduced fuel economy legislation in 2002, and this Com-
mittee  has  been  fighting  for  years  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  our  Nation’s  pas-
senger  fleet.  This  bill  is  one  of  the  most  important  pieces  of  energy  legislation  that 
we have passed during my time in the Senate—one which was sorely overdue. 

This  legislation  is  a  key  element  of  our  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  advanced  cars 
and trucks of the future are built here in America. Unfortunately, the Bush Admin-
istration  has  not  yet  promulgated  a  final  rule  implementing  the  2007  fuel  economy 
legislation. I hope that you view this as an opportunity to write a standard that will 
support  our  climate  change  and  energy  security  goals  by  moving  the  domestic  auto 
industry as quickly as practicable toward the goal of achieving at least 35 miles per 
gallon by 2020. 

The CHAIRMAN. And so be it. 
Senator  KERRY.  And  I  look  forward  to  supporting  your  nomina-
tion Congressman. We’d reached our agreements over lunch yester-
day  and  after  the  Inauguration,  but  I  really  look  forward  to  your 
stewardship there. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Kerry. And obvi-

ously I want to welcome everyone to the first session. 

Not everybody is here. But it’s two. Nobody expected it would be 

that early. 

And  I  wanted,  with  the  forbearance  of  the  three  distinguished 
people  at  the  witness  table,  I  want  to  just  say  a  word  about  the 
Committee.  I’m  not  Chairman.  I’m  still  Chairman  of  the  Intel-
ligence committee, so you can pitch me right out of the room if you 
want. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  But  Danny  actually  isn’t  big  enough  to  do  that, 

you see. So, I’m OK. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  This  is  a  very  exciting  thing  to  me.  I’m  deeply 
proud  to  be  Chairman  of  this  Committee  or  to  be  able  to  get  into 
that  position.  I’ve  been  on  this  Committee  for  24  years,  and  have 
specialized in certain areas. 

I  had  no  idea  until  I  started  to  do  preparation  the  unbelievable 
scope of what it is that we have to do, everything from putting ten 
extra runways at O’Hare Airport if Dick Durbin wants it. 

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. I mean, there’s just no end to our capacity of af-
fecting  climate  change,  transportation,  telecommunications,  the 
FCC.  We’ve  got  control  of  sports.  Unfortunately,  it’s  only  college 
sports, not professional sports, but—— 

[Laughter.]

The  CHAIRMAN.  We’ll  take  what  we  can  get.  And  I’m  very  proud 
that  Senator  Inouye,  who  I  think  is  going  to  come  today,  is  now 
doing  Appropriations.  And  I’m  very  proud  that  I’ve  been  able  to 
work with him. 

I  look  forward,  I  think  we  all  do,  to  working  very,  very  hard  for 
Americans,  setting  forth  a  very  aggressive  agenda  on  this  Com-
mittee.  I  think  this  Committee  over  the  years  has  had  its  ups  and 
downs,  but  we  have  not  been  always  at  our  best.  And  I  think  our 
challenge  now  is  to  be  at  our  best  all  the  time  on  all  subcommit-
tees, all subcommittees. Everything rises in importance to the level 
of anything else, not just what catches the moment or what seems 
to be the most intractable. 

I’m  also  looking  very  much  forward  to  working  with  Kay  Bailey 
Hutchison,  who  will  be  Ranking,  and  all  members  as  we  move 
things  through  the  Committee.  On  the  Democratic  side  we’re  wel-
coming  Senator  Mark  Begich,  who  evidently  walks  everywhere  in 
this  city.  Walked  home  from  the  last  ball  last  night.  Was  that  the 
three o’clock one? 

Senator BEGICH. I don’t know what time it ended, but it was late. 
The CHAIRMAN. It was late. OK. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator BEGICH. But I’m here for you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  And  Tom  Udall.  And  Mark  Warner.  All  of  them 
are  distinguished  people  who  are  going  to  be  on  the  Commerce 
Committee  when  the  resolution  passes,  which  could  very  well  be-
fore the end of the day I would think. 

We’re not organized, you know. We don’t know who the new Re-
publican  members  are  going  to  be.  And  I  hope  Kay  Bailey  comes 
and  tells  us  so  that  we  know.  But  we  are  not  able  at  this  point  to 
really  have  a  subcommittee  structure  fully  worked  out  as  to  who’s 
going to be on what subcommittee until we know who all the mem-
bers  are  going  to  be.  And  that  makes  sense.  And  it’s  frustrating. 
But it’s the way things should work if they have to work that way. 
I’m  very  excited  by  the  talent  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  here.  I 
think  when  you  really  look  at  the  scope  of  the  Commerce  Com-
mittee  you  see  it’s  endless.  And  it’s  one  of  the  original  committees 
created. And its work is really wherever we want it to go. 

I  think  we  can  be  a  big  part  of  climate  change  legislation,  a  big 
part of economic recovery. I look forward to working with members 
on a bipartisan basis, and I expect that we’ll get a lot done. 

I  want  us  to  have  a  very  aggressive  agenda.  That  doesn’t  mean 
that  we  meet  three  times  a  day,  but  it  means  that  we  meet  on  a 
regular basis. We’ll try to systemize that so people can put that on 
their  calendars,  whether  that’s  going  to  be  a  couple  times  a  week, 
whatever.  I  promise  that  I’ll  share  that  kind  of  news  with  my  col-
leagues very shortly. 

Now  we  have  to  begin  the  business  of  this  day,  which  is  a  very 
good  day,  because  we  have  before  us  the  confirmation  hearing  of 
Congressman  Ray  LaHood  to  be  Secretary  of  Transportation.  I’m 
for  him  anyway,  but  my  wife  Sharon  said  that  even  if  I  weren’t  I 
would  have  to  be  because  she’s  from  Illinois  too.  And  so,  that’s 
that. 

[Laughter.]

So I’d like to congratulate Representative LaHood on his nomina-
tion.  And  if  you  have  any  family  members  here  we  would  be  very 
proud to meet them. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Thank  you,  Senator.  Thank  you  very  much  for 
holding  this  hearing.  My  wife  and  three  of  my  children  are  here. 
And I would like to introduce them, if they would stand. 

My  wife  of  42  years,  Kathy.  Sitting  next  to  Kathy  is  my  son, 
Sam.  Behind  Sam  is  my  oldest  son,  Darren,  and  his  wife,  Kristen. 
And  my  daughter,  Amy,  and  her  husband,  Kevin  are  here.  Kevin, 
are you here? Stand up. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. LAHOOD. That is the LaHood army. It doesn’t get any better 

than that, Mr. Chairman. So, thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Now we also have another 
great  opportunity  because  we  have  former  Congressman  Bob 
Michel,  who  I’ve  always  been  a  great  fan  of.  I’ll  never  forget  that 
garage story you told me, Congressman Michel. It remains deep in 
my heart and part of my affection and respect for you. 

And  then  my  fellow  White  Sox  fan,  Dick  Durbin.  Well  that  was 
embarrassing last night. I mean there was only one White Sox fan 
in  the  entire  crew  out  there  in  Afghanistan.  And  I  kept  thinking 
about you. 

So they are going to introduce Congressman LaHood. And I can-
not  think  of  two  finer  human  beings,  more  experienced  people,  to 
be able to do that. And so, please do so. 

STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS 

Senator  DURBIN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  Let  me 
also  acknowledge  Senator  Hutchison.  Glad  you’re  with  us  here 
today at the kick-off of this newly-formed Commerce Committee. 

I want to personally thank the Chairman for who now is assum-
ing this responsibility. It was my good fortune to serve on the Intel-
ligence  Committee  for  4  years  where  you  served  as  Ranking  Mem-
ber  and  as  Chairman.  And  I  know  the  fine  work  you  did  there. 
Much  like  the  minister  who  shoots  a  hole  in  one  on  Sunday  morn-
ing, you couldn’t talk to us about your best work. 

And I just want to say publicly that you have dedicated yourself 
to  the  assignments  you’ve  been  given  whether  it’s  on  the  Intel-
ligence Committee or on the Commerce Committee and call on your 
staff  to  really  perform  at  the  highest  level.  I’m  glad  to  hear  it  will 
be an active committee. And under your leadership it will be a very 
effective committee. So I congratulate you on that score. 

You  know,  a  lot  of  us  here  wax  poetic  about  the  good  old  days 
around Capitol Hill. And for a few members on this committee, in-
cluding  Senator  Wicker,  who’ve  had  the  good  fortune  to  serve  in 
the House of Representatives, that’s where many of us got started. 
And there were great old days. 

And  I  can  recall  coming  to  the  Congress  and  meeting  right  off 
the bat, not only the Speaker of the House, Tip O’Neill, but one of 
his  closest  friends,  the  Republican  leader,  Bob  Michel  from  my 
State  of  Illinois.  Those  were  days  when  we  fought  like  cats  and 
dogs  on  the  floor  all  day  and  then  managed  to  find  some  time  to 
be  together  in  the  evenings  and  get  to  know  one  another  on  a  bi-

5 

partisan basis. And that really made for a much more pleasant and 
productive environment. I think what President Obama had to say 
yesterday  and  what’s  he’s  been  saying  throughout  his  campaign  is 
the hope that we will return to that environment. 

I  just  want  to  say  that  the  nominee  for  Secretary  of  Transpor-
tation is a person who follows in that tradition. Ray LaHood distin-
guished himself in many ways, first as Chief of Staff to the Minor-
ity  Republican  Leader,  Bob  Michel  and  then  in  his  own  right  as 
Congressman  from  that  same  district.  He  led  the  effort  in  the 
House of Representatives during some of the most divisive and con-
tentious  times  to  find  civility  and  decorum.  And  to  try  to  have  bi-
partisan  retreats  where  members  would  come  together  with  their 
families  and  really  come  to  know  one  another  on  a  personal  basis. 
As  you  come  to  know  Ray  you’ll  understand  why  his  leadership 
in  this  area  was  genuine  and  personal.  It’s  been  my  good  fortune 
to  know  him  for  many  years.  Born  and  bred  in  the  City  of  Peoria, 
Illinois, he’s been a schoolteacher before he got involved in govern-
ment  work.  And  I  will  tell  you  as  a  member  of  the  only  Congres-
sional delegation, a good bipartisan delegation, I didn’t have a clos-
er  friend  than  Ray  LaHood,  who  was  on  the  opposite  side  of  the 
aisle and represented my hometown of Springfield. 

We  worked  on  so  many  things  together,  transportation  projects, 
economic development projects. I trusted him completely. His word 
was  good.  And  I  knew  that  we  could  work  together  in  a  positive 
and  productive  way  and  show  some  results  at  the  end  of  the  day. 
We  also  co-chair  the  Abraham  Lincoln  Bicentennial  Commission 
which  will  celebrate  the  200th  anniversary  of  Abraham  Lincoln’s 
birth  in  February  of  this  year.  So  we’ve  worked  together  in  a  lot 
of different capacities. 

I  know  that  President  Obama  started  off  in  forming  his  Cabinet 
wanted to make sure that it was bipartisan and to show that there 
were leading Republicans who could serve in his Cabinet and do so 
effectively. I’ll be honest with you. I went to him and I said I think 
Ray LaHood is that person. I hope you’ll consider him. And he said 
he would. 

I  know  that  Rahm  Emmanuel  as  the  President’s  Chief  of  Staff 
knows Ray as closely as I do, as well as I do. And he felt the same 
way. And this opportunity came along and it was a great one. 

Because  Ray  LaHood  has  shown  his  understanding  of  transpor-
tation  issues  as  a  Member  of  Congress  and  has  worked  for  these 
issues  during  the  time  that  he  served.  We  have  this  traditional  ri-
valry that many of you have in your states between downstate and 
Chicago.  And  some  politicians  make  a  career  out  of  poking  the 
wounds  between  those  two  areas  and  trying  to  keep  everybody 
fighting with one another. 

Now  Ray  and  I  come  from  the  downstate  side  of  that  equation. 
Neither  of  us  has  ever  tried  to  capitalize  on  that  geographical  dis-
tinction.  If  we  had  an  important  meeting  of  the  Illinois  delegation 
about  a  major  mass  transit  issue  in  the  City  of  Chicago,  Ray 
LaHood  of  Peoria  would  be  there  because  of  his  genuine  interest 
in  our  state  and  its  transportation.  And  whether  it  was  highways 
for downstate, whether it was mass transit for the City of Chicago, 
the  development  of  one  of  the  nation’s  most  important  airports  in 
O’Hare  or  looking  forward  to  the  vision  of  how  we  can  use  smart

transportation modes to reduce the use of energy and to try to pro-
tect  our  environment,  Ray  LaHood  has  been  a  leader  in  that  re-
gard. 

Now  if  he  is  graced  with  the  approval  of  the  Senate  and  I  hope 
that he will be, to be our next Secretary of Transportation, he will 
have  an  awesome,  immediate  responsibility.  This  new  Recovery 
and  Reinvestment  bill  focuses  a  lot  on  our  nation’s  bridges,  high-
ways,  the  infrastructure,  the  airports,  realizing  that’s  critical  to 
economic  growth.  I  can’t  think  of  a  better  person  to  be  given  that 
assignment.  And  that’s  why  I  come  here  today  to  completely  sup-
port his nomination. 

A  former  DOT  official  was  recently  quoted  as  saying,  ‘‘the  most 
important part of the DOT Secretary’s job is knowing how to work 
with other people.’’ Well I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, Ray LaHood 
has  the  most  important  part  of  that  job  covered  if  he  becomes  our 
next Secretary of Transportation. I’m pleased and proud as a fellow 
Illinoisan  to  wholeheartedly  recommend  him  and  encourage  the 
confirmation of my friend, Ray LaHood. Thank you very much. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Yes, sir. 

STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL, 
FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, ILLINOIS 

Mr.  MICHEL.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I 
appreciate  the  opportunity  to  piggyback  on  the  great  introduction 
of our Senator Dick Durbin. I’ve known the LaHood family for over 
25 years. And I know that when Ray grew up it was in the climate 
of  work  ethic  and  certainly  being  frugal  about  how  you  spent  your 
money. 

Before his election to the Congress to succeed me as my Chief of 
Staff,  he  was  for  10  years  in  that  position  just  prior  to  his  being 
elected  to  the  Congress.  It  was  my  last  10  years  out  of  14  years 
as leader on the minority side of the aisle in the House. And during 
that  time  our  relationship  became  much  more  than  employee/em-
ployer  relationship.  Over  that  period  of  time  we  became  the  best 
of  friends.  I  think,  quite  frankly,  both  families  would  say  that  we 
were family with one another. 

He’s  a  very  quick  study  on  the  issues  of  the  day.  Always  careful 
in  his  decision-making  process.  And  has  a  special  gift  for  dealing 
fairly  with  his  contemporaries.  I  tell  you  he’s  guided  with  a  won-
derful, moral compass. He knows right from wrong. He’s an honest, 
forthright  individual.  I  could  trust  him,  as  Senator  Durbin  said, 
without any reservation whatsoever. 

And  as  a  Congressman  he  was  no  ideologue,  a  conservative  Re-
publican,  always  a  gentleman  and  respectful  of  his  contemporaries 
and  willing  to  work  for  a  consensus.  His  special  efforts  to  improve 
the  relationship  in  the  House  which  is  at  times—I’d  enjoyed  the 
wonderful  days  earlier  on.  And  then  it  became  worse  and  worse 
and  the  rancorous  exchanges;  it  was  just  rather  nauseating  at 
times. 

Ray had the good experience of having experienced it really kind 
of  under  both  conditions.  And  when  he  came  then  to  the  Congress 
he  wanted  to  do  whatever  he  could  to  let’s  get  back  to  the  days 
when we could talk with one another and counsel with one another. 
And  as  Dick  Durbin  has  said,  he  did  a  marvelous  job  trying  to  or-

ganize, I think, three or four of those retreats with so many what-
ever  Republicans  wanted  to  come,  whatever  number  of  Democrats 
wanted. 

And  as  a  matter  of  fact  it  led  to  Tom  Foley  and  I,  the  then 
Speaker,  former  Speaker  of  the  House,  to  visit  and  counsel  with 
some  of  those  freshman  members  to  try  and  encourage  them  to 
take advantage of that opportunity to get to know one another. And 
do  away  with  these  acrimonious  exchanges.  Well,  after  a  while  it 
dissipated  and  but  I  always  have  to  give  Ray  the  credit  for  trying 
to make the most of it. 

And then finally, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate your conceding 
to my asking for just a minute or two to buttress Dick Durbin’s in-
troduction. I have to applaud the President for seeing the qualities 
in  Ray  LaHood  that  will  serve  his  Administration  well.  I  think 
there’s no question but that every member of this committee when 
all is said and done, will be mighty proud of his service as the Sec-
retary  of  Transportation.  And  I’m  sure  Ray  will  always  keep  in 
mind  too,  that  he  has  an  obligation,  certainly  to  please  the  Presi-
dent who is the benefactor in this case. And thank you, Mr. Chair-
man  and  the  members  of  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to 
speak on behalf of my dear friend and compatriot, Ray LaHood. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Congressman.  Thank  you  very,  very 

much. 

Mr. MICHEL. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  Let  me  just  say  before  I  call  on  Kay 
Bailey  Hutchison,  the  Ranking  Member  to  make  any  comments 
that she may want to make, that we had to postpone this hearing. 
And it’s one of those infuriating things called paperwork. 

People  have  to  answer  so  many  questions  now.  And  so  the  word 
was well they hadn’t finished the paperwork, so that’s why we had 
to cancel the meeting and then people said it was the FBI that does 
the  paperwork  so  we  removed  the  word  FBI  because  otherwise  ev-
erybody would think something was going on, Ray. We didn’t want 
that because, you know, the Ranking Member and I read your FBI 
report and it’s just sparkling clean and I wanted to say that. 

Before  we  actually  proceed,  my  opening  statement  will  come  be-
fore  my  opening  questions.  And  I’d  now  like  to  say  that  I’m  very 
honored  to  have  as  the  Ranking  Member  Kay  Bailey  Hutchison. 
We’ve  served  on  this  committee  together  for  years.  We’ve  done 
aviation  together  successfully  for  a  number  of  years.  It’s  a  very 
strong  working  relationship.  She’s  an  extraordinarily  talented  per-
son,  as  everybody  knows.  And  I  would  like  to  call  on  you,  Senator 
Hutchison for whatever comments you might want to make. 
STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since this is our 
first  real  hearing  as  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  I  appreciate 
your  remarks  and  do  look  forward  to  having  this  relationship  con-
tinue. We’ve done some great work in aviation. We had and agreed 
to FAA reauthorization through our committee last year. 

I  look  forward  to  working  on  that  again  this  year.  And  I  hope 
that our committee will be very active. And I look forward to work-
ing with you.

I  also  wanted  to  welcome  the  new  members  on  our  side  of  the 
committee.  Johnny  Isakson,  Sam  Brownback,  Mel  Martinez,  Mike 
Johanns, our new members that will be joining our committee this 
year. 

Congressman  LaHood,  we  welcome  you.  And  certainly  you  have 
had two outstanding endorsements already. And many of us who’ve 
worked  with  you  do  agree  with  your  integrity  and  the  ability  to 
come together and do things in a bipartisan way. And I think your 
appointment  shows  that  we  are  going  to  have  input  that  will  be 
very important in this Administration. 

There are three areas that I am concerned with, that I think are 
a  priority.  Certainly  this  year  the  Highway  Trust  Fund,  the  High-
way  Reauthorization  will  be  before  us.  And  it  is  my  hope  that  we 
can timely pass a Highway Authorization bill. 

I  say  that  with  almost  tongue  in  cheek  because  it  usually  takes 
us three or four years to pass that five-year bill. And then we pass 
it and a year later, we have to do it again. But it is important that 
we work together and you will be a key leader here. 

One  of  my  great  concerns  is  the  Highway  Trust  Fund.  I  think  it 
does not meet today’s test of relevance. Certainly the highway sys-
tem, the Federal system has been built out. We have the skeleton. 
And I think today, unlike when President Eisenhower started the 
system, every state has its own priorities and its own capability to 
fund.  So  I  think  the  old  donor/donee  concept  really  needs  to  be 
looked at carefully. We would always have to have some small per-
centage  of  the  gasoline  taxes  for  the  maintenance  of  the  highway 
system. I think we would all agree on that. 

But I do think now that states have such great needs that espe-
cially  growing  states  like  mine,  that  are  also  donor  states,  need 
some relief from the huge amount that we send to Washington and 
never  get  back.  We’re  now  looking  at  more  toll  roads,  more  taxes 
to  fund  our  highways  when  we’re  sending  billions  to  Washington 
and  going  to  other  states.  So  I  hope  that  we  can  start  looking  at 
a  concept  where  states  would  be  able  to  have  their  own  money, 
their own priorities in the Highway Trust Fund with some smaller 
amount  that  would  be  kept  for  maintenance.  That  is  something 
that  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  has  suggested  in  the  last  6 
months  or  so.  And  I  think  it’s  something  that  is  very,  very  impor-
tant for us to start discussing. 

Second, FAA Reauthorization, which as we have noted, this com-
mittee  passed  in  a  very  bipartisan  way  because  it  is  so  important. 
And  our  bill  passed  through  the  Senate  and  was  generally  sup-
ported. It did not get through conference so we still don’t have one. 
And in March the FAA extension runs out. 

We know that NextGen for our air traffic control system is essen-
tial for us to be able to use our air space in the most efficient way, 
in  the  most  safe  way  and  also  our  ground  space.  And  because  our 
NextGen has not been able to go forward in a comprehensive way, 
we  do  still  have  many  delays,  especially  in  the  New  York  airspace 
which then affects the whole country. 

So I hope that it will be one of your major priorities that we pass 
an FAA Reauthorization bill and that we get it signed by the Presi-
dent  and  that  we  really  focus  on  our  air  traffic  control  system  be-
coming  more  efficient  and  certainly  with  safety  as  a  priority.  I

think  we  can  do  that.  And  we  will  certainly  need  the  help  of  this 
Administration. 

Third, is Amtrak and high-speed rail. I believe that this Adminis-
tration that has just taken the oath of office yesterday will be more 
favorable  to  Amtrak.  And  one  of  the  things  that  Senator  Lauten-
berg  and  I  have  done  on  this  committee  is  made  a  pact  that  Am-
trak is Amtrak, that our national system is important for our coun-
try  and  for  the  future.  And  I  support  the  Northeast  Corridor  and 
he  and  others  that  are  in  the  Northeast  support  the  national  sys-
tem. 

But  the  national  system  has  been  a  stepchild.  And  if  we  are 
going  to  continue  to  have  very  bad  service,  it’s  going  to  exacerbate 
the  problem  with  the  funding.  So  I  hope  that  you  will  look  at  Am-
trak  and  high-speed  rail  as  a  priority  in  this  Administration.  Be-
cause  I  think  if  we’re  going  to  have  a  transportation  system  that 
serves  all  the  people  of  our  country,  it’s  going  to  mean  we  have 
aviation,  we  have  high-speed  rail  and  Amtrak  from  which  states 
can  form  compacts  and  add  to  the  efficiencies  as  well  as  of  course, 
our highway system. 

And  I  think  with  that  kind  of  priority  focus  we  can  do  so  much 
better. And I look forward to working with you to that end. Thank 
you. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Hutchison follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 
Thank  you  Senator  Rockefeller,  it  is  always  a  pleasure  to  work  with  you  and  I 
look  forward  to  a  prosperous  session  in  our  new  roles.  Senator  Rockefeller  and  I 
have worked together for a number of years, most recently as respective Chair and 
Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee. We have always worked in a bipar-
tisan manner and I look forward to the challenges ahead of us. 

Many  of  the  Committee’s  most  difficult  challenges  will  also  test  today’s  nominee. 
I am pleased that this Committee is moving expeditiously on the nomination of the 
Honorable Raymond LaHood for the position of Secretary of Transportation. I think 
this  is  very  appropriate  since  the  range  of  problems  confronting  the  next  Secretary 
is  amongst  the  most  difficult  that  any  new  Secretary  has  faced  in  quite  some  time. 
As  Rep.  LaHood  is  keenly  aware,  we  are  all  looking  for  ways  to  revive  our  econ-
omy  and  many  have  suggested  infrastructure  and  other  transportation  related 
projects can play a long term role in moving our country forward. 

It  is  important  our  next  Transportation  Secretary  provides  the  stable  leadership 
and  strong  voice  needed  to  ensure  transportation  is  a  priority  within  the  new  Ad-
ministration. 

I  expect  Rep.  LaHood  will  need  to  hit  the  ground  running.  While  I  reserve  final 
judgment  and  although  the  specific  details  of  a  stimulus  package  are  not  yet  clear, 
transportation  infrastructure  programs  are  likely  to  receive  an  increase  in  funding. 
If  enacted,  the  quick  and  efficient  delivery  of  those  funds  to  high  priority  projects 
will  be  challenging,  but  it  is  very  important  they  are  spent  appropriately  and  effi-
ciently. 

One  prerequisite  and  commitment  I  would  like  from  Rep.  LaHood,  is  to  create 
some  short-term  stability  in  our  transportation  programs.  Many  States  have  good 
ready-to-go  highway  projects  that  will  improve  surface  infrastructure  and  bolster 
the economy; not just through the addition of construction jobs, but also through the 
improved movement of goods and people. 

Unfortunately,  the  existing  highway  program  expires  at  the  end  of  September, 
however.  So  Congress  and  the  new  Administration  will  have  to  work  very  hard  on 
a  reauthorization.  This  will  be  very  difficult  because  of  the  current  fiscal  state  of 
the  Highway  Trust  Fund  and  also  because  the  current  formula’s  disparate  treat-
ment  between  the  states.  But  we  must  reauthorize  the  program  and  stop  passing 
short-term  extensions  that  send  out  dribbles  of  money  to  the  states,  preventing 
states  ability  to  plan  and  undertake  large  transportation  projects.  Many  projects 
could grind to a halt if we don’t act.

We  have  already  seen  this  scenario  play  out  with  the  FAA  reauthorization  bill, 
creating  a  dire  situation  with  the  airport  grants  program.  We  all  know  that  our 
aviation  system  is  facing  significant  capacity  constraints.  The  problem  is  that  the 
current  extension  for  the  program  and  the  taxes  that  support  the  aviation  trust 
fund expire at the end of March. The airports have only received half a year’s fund-
ing. 

I hope that Rep. LaHood, if confirmed, would support a full Fiscal Year extension 
of  the  current  FAA  Reauthorization  bill,  through  September  30,  2009.  This  Com-
mittee will work hard to pass a new FAA Reauthorization bill, but we will need the 
Secretary’s support and coordination to do so in a timely manner. 

As  Secretary,  you  will  also  need  to  keep  a  close  managerial  eye  on  the  FAA’s  air 
traffic  control  modernization  program,  known  as  NextGen.  The  funding,  implemen-
tation, and transition management of NextGen needs to be a priority for the Depart-
ment.  We  are  currently  operating  outdated  equipment  with  ever  increasing  conges-
tion  issues  in  the  air  and  on  the  ground.  These  congestion  issues  are  causing  prob-
lems throughout the aviation system, particularly in the New York airspace. A near- 
term  focus  is  necessary  on  our  national  air  transportation  system  if  we  expect  to 
meet  the  future  travel  demands  and  eliminate  gridlock  in  our  skies  and  at  our  air-
ports. 

I also look forward to hearing your views on Amtrak and high speed rail. I believe 
this  is  an  area  we  have  neglected  too  long.  The  Amtrak  reauthorization  that  has 
just  been  signed  into  law  is  an  important  step,  but  now  we  need  strong  leadership 
at  the  Department  to  ensure  that  we  have  a  national  passenger  rail  system  that 
works. 

I look forward to your testimony. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Hutchison. 
What  I’m  going  to  do  now  and  I’m  still  working  it  over  in  my 
mind  if  I  want  to  make  this  a  regular  practice.  I  think  sometimes 
if every single member gives an opening statement, when you have 
people  who  have  flown  in  from  all  kinds  of  places  to  testify,  and 
if  you  have  a  full  committee,  which  I  hope  we’re  going  to  have  be-
cause  it’s  going  to  be  an  exciting  committee  and  people  are  going 
to  want  to  be  here  no  matter  what  the  subcommittee  or  in  some 
cases  the  full  committee  meeting  might  be  about,  that  opening 
statements take time. 

The other side of that is that members have other meetings. And 
I  have  to  recognize  that,  and  that  they  have  things  they  want  to 
say. 

So today we’re going to have opening statements from each mem-
ber.  I  should  say  incidentally  that  our  three  new  members,  one  of 
whom has already defected—— 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Are  to  be  treated  today  as  members  of  the  Sen-
ate and because we don’t have our actual ratios worked out yet. So 
just members of the Senate, I mean you’re just going to have to live 
with that, hopefully just for one day. 

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. Is that OK? Alright. 
And also I’d like to say that from now on I want to call on people 
according  to  the  order  in  which  they  arrived  at  the  Committee. 
This  is  not  going  to  be,  like  most  everything  in  the  Senate,  based 
on  seniority.  I  think  having  people  speak  other  than  on  the  basis 
in which they arrived. If they arrived early, they should speak ear-
lier. 

And I just happen to believe in that. But today we’ll also use the 
seniority  system  for  that.  We’ll  start  with  Senator  Cantwell,  then 
we’ll go to Senator Snowe and then back and forth.

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  don’t  have  a 
very  long  opening  statement.  But  I  am  concerned  that  I  may  not 
be  here  for  the  question-and-answer  part.  So  I’ll  just  outline  my 
statement  if  I  could,  and  hope  that  perhaps  that  I  will  be  able  to 
get back and ask you some questions. 

But obviously I want to congratulate you on your nomination and 
for  your  hard  work  in  the  Congress.  You  may  know  that  Wash-
ington  State  recently  has  been  very  hard  hit  by  a  lot  of  flooding. 
In  fact  Secretary,  your  predecessor,  Secretary  Peters  traveled  to 
Washington  State  to  look  at  and  assess  the  flood  damage  along  I– 
5  and  also  brought  with  her  some  $2  million  in  emergency  relief 
funds which we very much appreciated. 

I  want  to  say  that  we’ll  be  looking  forward  to  working  with  you 
on what may be as much as $125 million in damage to flood areas 
in our state. And that brings up an even larger question. Just—I’m 
trying  to  make  this  as  short  as  possible,  but  the  previous  flood 
damage  that  we  had  a  year  ago—every  day  that  I–5  is  closed  it 
costs our economy $10 to $12 million. 

It’s  a  freeway  stretch  that  typically  carries  about  10,000  trucks 
a  day,  so  that  and  our  mountain  passes  being  shut  down  is  where 
you get the $125 million in those kinds of activities. So in addition 
to looking at that question there is a very good, specific point, and 
I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  comments  about  what  you’re  going 
to do about funding of mega-projects. 

Mega-projects always get a lot of attention in assessing the issue. 
But  trying  to  take  our  transportation  funding  mechanisms  and 
breaking them down into a mechanism that will actually get those 
projects funded and not delayed for us in the State of Washington. 
We  have  three  different  mega-projects  that  are  of  importance  to 
us:  the  Columbia  River  crossing,  the  Alaska  Way  Viaduct  and  the 
SR  520  Bridge.  Two  of  those  are  in  jurisdiction  of  Seattle  and  the 
Mayor  and  some  of  the  council  members  are  here  in  D.C.  talking 
about the major plan that they are about to unveil for both of those 
projects.  So  I  apologize  if  I’m  off  meeting  with  them  to  hear  those 
details instead of being back here. 

And last I would just like to say, Mr. Chairman that it’s very im-
portant  to  me  the  oversight  that  our  committee  has  in  looking  at 
your  agency  and  the  role  you  play  as  Secretary  of  Transportation 
in  helping  us  in  the  implementation  of  CAFE,  the  fuel  efficiency 
standards.  I  think  that  this  is  something  that  is  very  important. 
The last Administration I would say, dropped the ball on their abil-
ity  to  fully  implement  those  regulations  in  a  way  that  would  have 
helped us and helped American consumers. And so I’ll look forward 
to your comment on that particular issue. 

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  make  this 

statement. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. Senator Snowe?

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator  SNOWE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  congratulations 
on  your  chairmanship.  It’s  great  to  have  this  committee  and  to 
have your leadership, thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well we’ve done a lot of work together. 
Senator SNOWE. We have. And we will on this committee. 
The CHAIRMAN. That’s right. 
Senator  SNOWE.  And  I  just  want  to  congratulate  you,  Congress-
man  LaHood.  And  I  want  to  personally  welcome,  it’s  a  privilege  to 
see  Congressman  Bob  Michel.  I  served  with  Bob  in  the  House  of 
Representatives  for  many  of  the  years  in  which  he  was  the  Minor-
ity  Leader.  Out  of  my  16  years  it  was  probably  the  better  part  of 
a decade. 

And so I’m very pleased to see him here today. And it’s reminis-
cent of the, you know, the many outstanding accomplishments that 
he  achieved  during  his  tenure,  his  long-standing  service  to  this 
country. And I just want to say that it’s great to see you here, Bob. 
And  also  reminiscent  of,  you  know,  the  working  together  and  the 
bipartisanship that always, was a hallmark of your leadership. 

And  I  certainly  can  testify,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  the  relationship 
that  existed  with  Congressman  LaHood  and  Congressman  Bob 
Michel.  It  certainly  was  that.  And  Congressman  LaHood  you  have 
certainly  got  an  outstanding  record  of  public  service,  not  only  in 
the  House  of  Representatives,  but  of  course  in  your  service  to  Bob 
Michel  as  well.  And  you’ve  always  had  a  reputation  for  fairness 
and  pragmatism.  And  so  I’m  just  very  pleased  that  you  have  been 
nominated to this capacity. 

As  we  discussed  2  weeks  ago  there  are  a  number  of  issues  that 
obviously you’re going to have to address as Secretary of Transpor-
tation. And most notably as Senator Hutchison mentioned it’s going 
to  be  infrastructure  and  transportation  policy.  The  two  corner-
stones  of  our  transportation  policy  of  course  is  the  Surface  Trans-
portation Act as well as the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, the FAA which is long overdue as you all know. It 
expired about 18 months ago, in fact. 

But we’re seeing a number of issues that are plaguing the system 
that  we  will  have  to  address  as  congestion  continues  both  on  our 
highways and in the air. Prices continue to rise. States are cutting 
back because of their own budgetary shortfalls. Those that are not 
able  to  supplement  their  transportation  infrastructure,  transpor-
tation  programs  and  so  all  the  more  reliant  on  those  Federal  dol-
lars. 

And  we’ll  have  to  re-evaluate  the  Highway  Trust  Fund  and  the 
way  in  which  we  fund  the  Trust  Fund.  That  is  certainly  deficient. 
One of the first bailouts we had last year in fact was the Highway 
Trust Fund when they had a shortfall of more than $8 billion. 

It  is  expected  that  we  could  have  a  shortfall  of  $79  billion  by 
2015. And as members of the Senate Finance committee, we heard 
testimony from the Government Accountability Office this last July 
saying  that  the  current  system  is  simply  unsustainable.  Just  road 
maintenance alone over the next 6 years will cost $350 billion and 
we  have  one  in  five  bridges  that  are  woefully  deficient  and  func-
tionally obsolete.

So  as  obviously  revenues  are  declining  to  the  Highway  Trust 
Fund,  as  vehicles  become  more  fuel-efficient  which  is  critically  im-
portant. We’ll have to see how we will be able to fund the Highway 
Trust  Fund  with  alternative  revenues  or  alternative  sources.  But 
we’ll  have  to  be  creative.  And  we’ll  have  to  prioritize  our  invest-
ments without question. 

The  overall  state  of  the  aviation  industry  is  a  great  concern  to 
many  of  us  and  certainly  to  Senator  Boxer  and  myself.  We  intro-
duced  a  Passenger  Bill  of  Rights  which  is  simply,  you  need  a  na-
tional  standard  according  to  the  courts.  When  states  have  taken, 
you know, their grievances to the court is that they need a Federal 
standard.  And  we’ve  seen  the  fact  that  the  industry  has  failed  to 
unilaterally  and  voluntarily  adopt  a  customer  service  standard. 
And  that’s  why  we  believe  we  should  have  a  Passenger  Bill  of 
Rights. 

And finally CAFE standards as Senator Cantwell indicated. That 
will be one of your first, hopefully, responsibility to issue a regula-
tion  for  the  model  year  2011.  Regrettably  it  wasn’t  done  in  this 
past  Administration.  But  it’s  critically  important  if  we’re  going  to 
stay on track for creating more fuel-efficient vehicles. Senator Fein-
stein and I led the effort for the CAFE standards. We want to stay 
on track and do more and so hopefully that that will be one of your 
first actions as Secretary of Transportation. 

Finally, Essential Air Service for rural communities. I know that 
you’ve  been  a  strong  advocate  when  you  served  as  well  on  the 
Transportation Committee in the House of Representatives. I truly 
hope  that  you  will  look  at  legislation  that  Senator  Bingaman  and 
I have introduced to provide more flexibility. 

We  have  seen,  you  know,  more  than  1,000  communities  across 
this  country  in  half  the  states,  we  have  lost,  aviation  service.  And 
that  is  truly  the  life  blood  of  their  economy,  certainly  that  is  true 
in  our  state.  And  we  have  to  do—we  really  do  have  to  develop  a 
policy  of  some  kind  that’s  going  to  provide  the  incentives  and  the 
support to our communities so that they can continue to have avia-
tion services. It’s so important for economic development. 

So again I want to thank you. And I am pleased to see you here 
today, and most importantly, notably, the position that you will as-
sume. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Snowe follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, Congressman LaHood, I would like to con-
gratulate you on your nomination. Given your productive, bipartisan record as a leg-
islator  during  your  fourteen  years  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  I  am  very 
pleased  that  President  Obama  selected  such  a  strong  and  accomplished  nominee 
with a reputation for fairness and pragmatism. After more than thirty years of dis-
tinguished  public  service,  I  am  certain  you  were  looking  forward  to  a  leisurely  re-
tirement.  Instead,  you  will  be  facing  enormous  challenges  on  a  variety  of  fronts  as 
you begin your tenure as the Secretary of Transportation. 

Once again, Congress and the Department will seek to complete the long-overdue 
reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, and looming on the horizon 
is the increasingly contentious Surface Transportation Bill, or Highway Bill, due to 
expire this October. These two cornerstones of our national transportation policy are 
operating,  to  one  degree  or  another,  on  principles  that  are  increasingly  irrelevant 
in  our  current  economy.  The  means  by  which  we  fund  Federal  infrastructure  need 
to be carefully reexamined, while our air traffic control system continues to operate 
under  an  outdated,  analog  system  that  reduces  fuel  efficiency  and  does  little  to  re-

duce  congestion.  This  is  not  just  the  deterioration  of  our  infrastructure  that  is  at 
stake. The lifeblood of our economy, the ability to move goods and people efficiently 
from place to place, is in jeopardy. 

One  of  Congress’  first  bailouts  last  year  was  not  the  troubled  financial  services 
industry,  but  the  Highway  Trust  Fund,  to  the  tune  of  $8  billion;  or  the  number  by 
which  our  obligations  outpaced  revenues  flowing  into  the  Fund.  Forecasts  now  pre-
dict  the  Federal  Highway  Trust  Fund  will  be  insolvent  for  years,  and  faces  ever- 
increasing  deficits,  as  much  as  $79  billion  in  2015.  As  you  are  well  aware,  having 
been  a  member  of  the  House  Committee  on  Transportation  during  the  crafting  of 
the  TEA–21  legislation,  such  a  shortfall  would  place  our  Nation’s  roads  and 
bridges—already in bad shape—at greater risk. In 2004, the Department published 
a study on road maintenance indicating that $350 billion over 6 years was necessary 
simply  to  maintain  our  nation’s  infrastructure.  That  was  5  years  ago.  I  can  only 
speculate  the  number  has  grown  since  that  time,  not  to  mention  the  fact  that  such 
an  estimate  does  not  account  for  any  improvements,  which  would  clearly  be  nec-
essary  given  our  increasing  population  and  the  growing  distances  commuters  are 
traveling from municipalities, ensuring that Federal priorities are funded with reve-
nues distributed out of the Highway Trust Fund. 

One of your first duties as Secretary of Transportation will be to issue regulations 
on  the  Ten-in-Ten  Fuel  Economy  Act,  which  I  authored  along  with  Senators  Fein-
stein,  Inouye,  Cantwell,  Kerry,  Dorgan,  and  Lautenberg.  It  was  over  a  year  ago 
when the President signed this landmark legislation—the first increase in fuel econ-
omy  since  1975,  yet  no  regulations  have  been  issued.  As  you  know,  Federal  statute 
requires  that  for  the  2011  model  year  regulations  be  issued  by  April  1  of  this  year 
in order to give automakers adequate time to meet the new requirements. If the De-
partment  of  Transportation  fails  to  meet  this  deadline,  yet  another  year  will  be 
squandered in reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil imports, and saving Americans 
money at the pump. It is my expectation that aggressive and timely regulations will 
be issued that reflect the maximum feasible levels and incorporate all of the benefits 
of  improved  fuel  economy.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  comments  on  the  imple-
mentation  of  this  critical  law  and  it  is  my  expectation  that  the  Department  of 
Transportation  will  address  this  issue  expeditiously—another  year  delay  would  be 
unacceptable. 

On a related topic that not only addresses fuel efficiency, but also safety and eco-
nomic fairness, my home state of Maine has long sought an exemption from the Fed-
eral weight limit for motor carriers. Instead of large trucks traveling on Interstates 
that  were  designed  to  accommodate  heavier  vehicles,  we  have  trucks  weighing  as 
much as 100,000 pounds idling at stop lights and stop signs in small towns and vil-
lages,  increasing  emissions  and  wasting  diesel  fuel.  These  trucks  threaten  pedes-
trians,  bicyclists,  and  other  individuals  who  otherwise  would  remain  out  of  danger 
were these large trucks permitted to operate on the Interstates. Why is this a ques-
tion  of  economic  fairness?  Maine’s  neighbors,  Massachusetts  and  New  Hampshire, 
each possess waivers for trucks in excess of 100,000 pounds—while our neighbor to 
the  north,  Canada,  permits  well  over  100,000  pounds  on  their  Federal  roadways. 
Coupled  with  the  paucity  of  rail  infrastructure  in  much  of  Maine,  our  state  is  the 
last  choice  in  New  England  through  which  to  transport  freight.  In  the  meantime, 
pedestrians  are  being  endangered—and  in  some  cases,  killed—by  larger  motor  car-
riers  moving  through  residential  areas.  I  do  not  believe  we  can  consider  the  80,000 
pound  Federal  limit  a  standard  any  longer,  when  more  than  half  of  the  fifty  states 
possess some sort of an exemption from this so-called ‘standard’. I find it unaccept-
able that Maine cannot be considered for such a statewide exemption, and will con-
tinue to work toward greater safety and economic fairness for my home state. 

Aviation  remains  another  key  component  of  this  Committee’s  jurisdiction  that 
must  be  addressed.  Now  approaching  eighteen  months  past  the  expiration  of  the 
FAA  authorization,  our  aviation  industry  is  facing  difficult  challenges  that  are  re-
sulting  in  consolidation,  bankruptcy,  and  reductions  in  service—particularly  to 
smaller communities. Capacity in 2008 was reduced by nearly 10 percent; fuel prices 
shattered  previous  records  and  placed  many  legacy  carriers  on  dangerous  footing. 
As  jet  fuel  prices  have  declined,  the  global  economic  recession  deepened,  resulting 
in  fewer  passengers  and  a  continuing  reduction  in  revenues.  What  has  the  indus-
try’s response been to these economic challenges? Instead of making flying more at-
tractive to consumers, many airlines are quietly squeezing more hard-earned dollars 
out of passengers by heaping hidden costs onto basic customer services, such as re-
serving  flights  by  phone.  I  believe  such  policies,  which  differ  from  airline  to  airline 
but,  for  the  most  part,  are  practiced  by  almost  all  of  the  commercial  carriers,  are 
short-sighted and only serve to encourage fewer passengers. 

Many  of  the  airlines  seem  to  believe  that  their  patrons  are  a  captive  audience— 
passengers  must  simply  accept  whatever  hardship  the  airlines  choose  to  impose

upon them. To some extent, sadly, they are correct. It is my hope that we can trans-
form  that  attitude.  Congressman  LaHood,  it  is  my  hope  that  we  can  work  outlying 
suburbs and rural areas in order to go to work, school, or enjoy recreational opportu-
nities. 

While the burgeoning raft of surcharges and fees continues to outrage myself and 
my  constituents,  the  failure  to  move  the  Passenger  Bill  of  Rights  legislation  intro-
duced  by  Senator  Boxer  and  I  is  even  more  troubling  because  enhanced  safety  is 
at  stake.  Stranding  passengers  on  aircraft  for  hours  at  a  time,  in  some  extreme 
cases for up to 14 hours, is unconscionable. Those passengers have no real recourse. 
Long legal battles to recoup the price of a ticket are not a wise investment, particu-
larly against an airline with legions of attorneys. In fact, due to our inaction, states 
began  implementing  their  own  Passenger  Rights  legislation.  Last  year,  New  York 
State enacted such a law. However, a Federal Appeals Court ruled it was unconsti-
tutional,  claiming  that  any  such  consumer  rights  required  a  ‘‘Federal  standard.’’ 
That is a clarion call for Congress, and the Department, to act. 

Why  must  the  Federal  Government  act?  These  problems  continue  to  plague  pas-
sengers;  despite  the  system-wide  reduction  in  the  number  of  planes  in  the  skies, 
over  a  thousand  aircraft  were  stranded  on  tarmacs  for  over  3  hours  in  2008—and 
that  doesn’t  even  include  figures  for  November  and  December.  Additionally,  statis-
tics  show  record  levels  of  delays;  according  to  numbers  released  on  January  7, 
delays  are  hovering  at  nearly  an  hour  on  average.  While  airlines  are  seeking  the 
benefit  of  the  doubt,  Congress  gave  them  the  opportunity  to  create  voluntary  pro-
grams  in  1998.  As  evidenced  by  continuing  complaints  from  stranded  passengers, 
that effort has not been effective. In fact, the DOT Inspector General, Calvin Scovel, 
in his report to this Committee indicated the airlines’ 1998 Customer Service Initia-
tive fell well short of its promises, considering it ‘‘a failure.’’ 

Lastly, an issue that is of great significance to many of my constituents and, judg-
ing  by  your  record  on  the  issue,  your  former  district  as  well,  is  rural  aviation  serv-
ice.  Provided  primarily  through  the  Essential  Air  Service  program,  many  of  these 
communities  were  promised  by  Congress  that,  when  we  deregulated  the  airlines  in 
1978,  they  would  remain  part  of  the  new  infrastructure  system  that  would  result 
from  this  unleashing  of  the  commercial  air  carriers.  Yet  every  year  supporters  of 
the program must fight for funding, funding that is typically well below the author-
ized levels. Last Congress, Senator Bingaman and I introduced a bill that would re-
vise the EAS program, make it more responsive to the needs of the individual com-
munities that participate in the program, ensure funding levels to improve planning 
by  those  communities,  and  provide  greater  stability  for  both  the  carriers  and  those 
same  communities  that  rely  on  air  service  as  an  economic  development  tool.  It  is 
my  hope  that  after  years  of  neglect,  this  program  will  again  come  to  represent  the 
promise we made to those rural communities thirty years ago. 

In  short,  I  believe  we  must  have  an  efficient,  redundant  transportation  system, 
and  that  means  a  comprehensive,  broad-based  network  of  passenger  rail,  aviation, 
roads and bridges, and maritime transport. I look forward to hearing your proposals 
to allocate the resources to continue this Nation’s multi-faceted approach to insuring 
our ability to move goods and people around the country and the world. 

Mr.  LaHood,  I  thank  you  for  your  continued  exemplary  service  to  our  country, 
your  willingness  to  work  across  the  aisle,  and  for  your  integrity.  I  look  forward  to 
working with you as we enter a transformative time in American transportation pol-
icy. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Snowe. Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to 
you  for  taking  on  this  important  assignment.  I  have  worked  with 
you  for  many  years  on  the  Commerce  Committee  and  know  that 
you  have  a  major  interest  in  all  of  the  issues  in  front  of  us.  And 
I look forward to your guidance and leadership here. 

It’s  interesting  to  note  that  Ray  LaHood  is  here  from  the  State 
of Illinois and he’s had wonderful escorts to the table, Senator Dick 
Durbin, who we all know very well and are extremely proud of, and 
someone with whom I’ve had contact over the years and that’s Bob 
Michel.  And  we’re  glad  to  see  Bob  Michel  here.  We  always  listen

to  him  carefully  even  though  there  is  occasional  policy  disagree-
ment.  But  so,  Ray  you’ve  come  from  a  state  with  a  lot  of  distinc-
tion. 

Going  back  some  years,  I  don’t  remember  the  fellow’s  name  who 
was President from Illinois, but after Lincoln we had Everett Dirk-
sen  and  we  had  Paul  Simon.  We’ve  had  other  wonderful  people 
from the State of Illinois. They’ve always made large contributions 
to  the  well-being  of  our  country.  And  we  believe  that  you  will  also 
do that. 

In many ways Transportation Secretary is one of the most impor-
tant jobs in the country. And you’re going to be part of an Adminis-
tration  that  has  its  focus  on  economic  recovery.  The  President  has 
announced his intention to get things moving. 

One  way  to  do  that  in  my  view  is  to  make  investments  in  infra-
structure,  particularly  transportation,  because  people  are  ready  to 
go to work. The jobs are crying out for fulfillment. And we look for-
ward to having your agreement. 

We  count  on  the  Transportation  Secretary  to  keep  our  trains, 
buses and cars moving, but now we’ll be counting on the Secretary 
to help get our economy moving at the same pace that we hope our 
railroads will be moving. Congress and President Obama are work-
ing  on  an  economic  recovery  package  that  would  invest  in  our 
trains,  mass  transit,  roads,  bridges.  The  investment  would  create 
470,000  jobs  at  a  time  when,  as  Senator  Inouye  mentioned  in  an 
earlier  meeting  we  had  today,  there  are  recent  reports  of  500,000 
jobs lost in a month and that pace could accelerate, maybe even to 
650,000 jobs in a month. 

And so here’s one way to put people to work and things that will 
contribute  handsomely  to  the  well-being  of  the  country.  And  we 
hope  that  those  investments  will  come.  Hope  that  you’ll  be  able  to 
support and plead for those investments. 

Transportation  is  also  critical  to  our  environment:  our  energy 
independence, to use less oil, emit fewer greenhouse gases, and we 
need more Americans to use trains and mass transit. Many are al-
ready  making  that  choice.  Nearly  29  million  people  took  Amtrak 
last year, a major record. And just think of the number of cars that 
takes  off  the  road.  It’s  the  sixth  year  in  a  row  with  record  rider-
ship. 

In  addition,  nearly  three  billion  trips  were  taken  on  buses,  sub-
ways  and  other  transit  options  in  the  third  quarter  last  year,  a  6- 
percent  increase  over  the  same  quarter  in  2007  and  the  largest 
such  increase  in  25  years.  In  New  Jersey,  transit  is  more  than 
merely  a  way  to  get  around.  It’s  our  life  blood.  It  helps  businesses 
grow. It improves quality of life across the board. 

And  we  need  to  start  looking  at  transit  on  a  Federal  level.  The 
same  way  we  see  it  in  urban  centers  across  this  country.  Just 
building more roads will not solve our transportation problems. We 
can  no  longer  leave  passengers  stranded  on  the  tarmac  or  waiting 
in long lines at the airport. Travelers and commuters deserve more 
options like rail and transit to connect our communities, cities and 
travel hubs such as the airports. 

For  this  reason,  Mr.  LaHood,  we  need  a  strong  and  innovative 
Transportation  Secretary.  And  I  believe  that  with  the  wonderful 
recommendations  that  you  bring  with  you,  that  you’re  the  person

to  do  the  job.  I  was  pleased  to  meet  with  you  last  weekend  about 
these  challenges  and  others  important  to  New  Jersey  and  the  Na-
tion. 

First, we talked about the need to fully fund Amtrak and expand 
our passenger rail systems. Last year Congress and President Bush 
recognized  this  need  and  passed  the  bipartisan,  my  bill,  Amtrak 
bill.  This  committee  played  a  major  role  in  that  vision.  And  now 
we need to provide the funding to see that vision through. 

We also talked about the critical need for an additional rail tun-
nel  under  the  Hudson  River.  It’s  a  national  asset.  And  in  addition 
to  creating  more  than  50,000  jobs,  construction  jobs,  this  new  tun-
nel  will  handle  double  the  number  of  passengers  and  trains  going 
back  across  the  Hudson  River  from  New  Jersey  to  New  York.  But 
in  the  Northeast  Corridor,  which  is  the  busiest  rail  corridor  in  the 
country,  these  improvements  will  not  happen  without  strong  lead-
ership  in  the  Executive  Branch.  I  look  forward  to  working  with 
you, Ray LaHood on these key issues as we continue the confirma-
tion process. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Lautenberg.  Senator 

Wicker? 

STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator  WICKER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  too  am  de-
lighted  and  excited  that  my  classmate  and  former  colleague,  Ray 
LaHood is going to be our next Secretary of Transportation. 

We  came  to  elected  office  together  in  the  House  of  Representa-
tives  as  a  result  of  the  1994  elections.  We  were  both  staffers  for 
distinguished members of the House before that. And I can tell you 
that,  in  my  opinion,  Ray  LaHood  has  the  knowledge,  experience, 
knowhow and temperament to be a fine member of the Cabinet and 
an excellent Secretary. 

It’s already been mentioned that in the early days of our time in 
the  House  of  Representatives  Ray  LaHood  served  as  Co-Chairman 
of  the  House  bipartisan  retreat.  And  this  really  was  quite  an  un-
dertaking.  In  an  effort  to  get  not  only  rank-and-file  membership, 
but  the  leadership  of  House  Republicans  and  House  Democrats  to-
gether in a way that would promote unity and working together as 
Americans  and  a  little  relief  from  the  partisan  rancor  that  some-
times we hear about. 

It’s also a fact that for many years Ray LaHood has taken a lead-
ership position in the House prayer breakfasts. And Mr. Chairman 
this  is  an  ecumenical  group  which  meets  every  Thursday  morning 
for  prayer  in  a  bipartisan,  non-partisan  way  in  the  House  of  Rep-
resentatives.  So  it  should  be  no  surprise  based  on  that  that  our 
new  Democrat  President  has  chosen  this  Republican  to  be  a  part 
of his team. 

Ray, in your opening statement, you mentioned fundamental pil-
lars  of  openness  and  fairness.  And  I  think  certainly  you’ll  be  able 
to bring that to the Department. Also, it’s a fact. He’s no pushover, 
Mr. Chairman. Ray LaHood has a very low tolerance for nonsense. 
And I think that will also serve him well in this position. 

I  want  to  mention  by  way  of  opening  statement  and  maybe  I’ll 
get  a  chance  to  ask  a  question  about  it  later  on.  If  not,  certainly

one for the record. But it’s been pointed out by Senator Lautenberg 
and  others  that  a  good  deal  of  the  economic  stimulus  is  going  to 
be directed toward transportation infrastructure. 

I  see  a  proposal  here  for  $43.1  billion,  5  percent  of  the  total  in-
cluding  some  $30  billion  in  highway  infrastructure  investment.  In 
that  regard  I  want  to  caution  my  colleagues  and  the  Secretary 
about something that we call in Mississippi, the ‘‘Katrina effect’’ of 
sending  a  lot  of  infrastructure  spending  at  one  time.  Post  Katrina 
in  Mississippi  we  saw  a  huge  increase  in  contracting  costs  related 
to the recovery. 

We  spent  money  on  roads,  bridges,  fire  stations,  and  city  halls 
in addition to debris removal. And the extent that we spent money 
for those challenges was unparalleled. In the period following this, 
state  officials  and  contractors  often  mentioned  the  ‘‘Katrina  effect’’ 
on  cost.  They  were  referencing  increases  in  cost  across  all  trades 
related to the large influx of Federal funds and subsequent demand 
on  materials,  man  power  and  other  resources  necessary  to  under-
take the projects. 

So  I  would  just  say  to  our  Secretary-to-be  and  to  my  colleagues, 
we  need  to  be  mindful  of  this  issue  as  Congress  considers  billions 
of  dollars  in  transportation  spending.  I  love  to  see  highways  built. 
I  want  to  see  what  we  can  do  to  increase  the  number  of  bridges 
and roads built. 

But  if  all  of  these  shovel-ready  projects  are  bid  and  contracted 
in  a  very  short  period  of  time,  we  could  create  a  similar  situation 
that  we  had  with  the  ‘‘Katrina  effect’’  in  Mississippi  and  on  the 
Gulf Coast states. While the funds will flow, higher costs due to ab-
normally  high  demand  on  transportation  construction  industry 
could result in fewer projects undertaken because of increased cost. 
It will be up to us working with you, Mr. Secretary-designate to ar-
rive at a figure that our system can absorb without spiking the cost 
of this very needed infrastructure. 

And with that I yield back to the Chairman. And once again say 
how  delighted  I  am  that  my  colleague  and  brother  is  going  to  be 
assuming this leadership role. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Wicker  and  now,  Senator 

Warner? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK WARNER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator WARNER. Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first of 
all say how excited I am to be on this committee with your leader-
ship and the leadership of Ranking Member Hutchison. I’m looking 
forward to working with all of you. 

I  have  to  say  at  the  outset  that  as  many  in  the  room  know,  I, 
a  few  years  ago,  concluded  a  term  of  Governor  of  Virginia  and 
there  was  no  issue  more  vexing  than  transportation.  There  are  a 
lot of things I can probably point to that we accomplished, but solv-
ing  Northern  Virginia’s  transportation  woes  unfortunately  was  not 
one of them. 

Since  the  Chairman  has  given  me  opportunity  to  speak,  let  me 
just  raise  three  issues  very  quickly  that  I  hope  either  now  or  at 
some  other  point  we  can  discuss.  I  recall  as  Governor  how  chal-
lenging  it  was  at  times  to  deal  with  the  Department  of  Transpor-

tation  at  the  Federal  level  because  so  many  agencies  within  your 
control  over  the  last  year  plus  have  co-chaired  a  bipartisan  task 
force  on  infrastructure.  And  as  we  hopefully  move  toward  a  21st 
century  infrastructure  program  to  more  multi-modal  projects,  I 
wonder  if  you—I  know  this  is  very  early  in  your  thinking  process, 
but  have  you  given  any  thought  to  the  11  separate  agencies  you 
have  within  the  Department  and  how  the  boxes  are  aligned?  And 
whether  there  needs  to  be  any  realignment  of  those  functions  to 
make  sure  as  we  think  about  a  project  like  Dulles  rail  or  others 
that  use  aviation,  mass  transit  and  highway  combined  that  you’ve 
got  those  funding  flows  and  goals  all  aligned  on  a  multi-modal 
basis, number one? 

Second,  and  again  this  would  more  relate  to  surface  transpor-
tation  and  acting  on  something  Senator  Wicker  said,  I  really  won-
der  if  we’re  going  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  metrics.  You  know,  some 
of  the  old  standards  like  VMT  and  others  have  driven  some  of 
these  formulas  when  truly  at  this  point  mobility,  safety,  climate 
change,  and  a  host  of  these  other  issues  are  going  to  have  to  be 
somehow  factored  into  the  metrics  by  which  we  evaluate  projects. 
And I’d love to have your comments on that. 

And  finally,  on  perhaps  a  more  parochial  basis,  in  Virginia  we 
have  been  very  aggressive  on  the  usage  of  public/private  partner-
ships. And we have actually some wins in that category and again 
for  the  folks  in  the  region  we  will  soon  see  some  relief  on  the  Vir-
ginia side of the beltway with the addition of the hot lanes. I’d love 
to  have  your  thoughts  on  public/private  partnerships.  And  while 
I’m generally supportive, one of the things I think we always have 
to  watch  out  for  as  we  look  at  public/private  partnerships  is  mak-
ing  sure  that  the  private  sector  actually  has  some  skin  in  the 
game,  some  risk  capital,  and  it’s  not  just  the  public  sector  putting 
up  the  dough  and  the  private  sector  reaping  the  benefits  at  the 
back  end  of  the  project.  So  if  at  some  point  you  could  comment  on 
that as well. 

But Mr. Chairman, thank you for letting me, as a member of the 
Senate,  have  a  chance  to  make  a  couple  comments.  And  again,  I 
look forward to working with you on this and very other important 
matters on this committee. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  Senator  Warner.  And  now  I  have  to 

regain my senses here and call on Senator Pryor. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  congratulations 
to you for being Chairman of this committee. And I really look for-
ward  to  working  with  you  on  this  committee.  And  I  think  we  can 
have a great next couple of years here. 

Let  me  thank  Congressman  LaHood  for  putting  your  name  for-
ward for this very important post. And some of my colleagues here 
have identified just a few of the areas that you’re going to have to 
deal with in your time at the Department of Transportation. Some-
one  mentioned  rail,  mass  transit,  FAA,  highway  bill,  ports,  Am-
trak.  I  don’t  think  anyone  has  mentioned  pipelines,  but  you  really 
have a very full plate.

And  the  fact  that  you  come  so  highly  recommended  from  both 
Senator Wicker and my friend, Congressman Bozeman from Arkan-
sas  really  speaks  volumes.  And  the  fact  that  you  want  to  do  this 
in a very bipartisan way, I think that’s exactly where the American 
people are. And I think you’ll have a lot of folks on this committee 
that really want to help you succeed in doing that. 

So  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  And  I  look  forward  to  everyone’s 

statements and questions. Thank you. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator  Pryor.  And  so 

now, Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank 
you  for  holding  the  hearing  and  thank  Congressman  LaHood  for 
his willingness to serve in this capacity. I can echo what evidently 
was  stated  by  my  former  colleague  from  the  House,  now  colleague 
in the Senate, Senator Wicker, about Congressman LaHood. 

He is a quality appointment, someone who I had the great privi-
lege  of  working  with  when  I  was  a  member  of  the  House  on  the 
T and I Committee. And his former boss, Leader Michel is a legend 
in the House as well. It’s nice to see you here today. 

But I do want to just as we look to the challenges that are facing 
America’s infrastructure, say that in a state where we have lots of 
real  estate  and  vast  distances  and  not  a  lot  of  people,  that  planes, 
trains and automobiles are pretty important in South Dakota. And 
so  transportation  issues  are  critical  to  my  state.  And  as  my  col-
league  from  Arkansas  mentioned  we’ve  got  a  number  of  big  issues 
that  are  going  to  be  coming  down  the  pike,  not  the  least  of  which 
is the next highway bill. 

And  as  the  next  Secretary  of  Transportation  you  will  have  a  lot 
to  say  about  how  that  bill  is  shaped  and  put  together.  I  think  the 
cash-flow problems we’re facing in the trust fund are really critical. 
And  I  want  to  make  sure  as  we  go  through  the  process  that  we 
don’t de- emphasize highway investment in rural states. 

I think that when it comes to highways that Federal investment 
in states like South Dakota and others, that may be in the middle 
of  the  country,  enables  those  goods  to  move  from  one  part  of  the 
country to the other. And whether it’s Seattle to New York or Chi-
cago or wherever, people in businesses in those parts of the country 
benefit  from  the  investments  that  are  made  in  the  Midwest.  And 
areas  of  the  country  that  don’t  have  the  population  base  just  like 
the other areas of the country benefit as well. 

So and I had mentioned this to you in our individual discussion, 
but Senator Wyden and I have a proposal that we’ve been building 
support  for  called  the  Build  America  Bonds  Act  which  would  help 
out  all  states  and  not  just  large  states  with  multibillion  dollar  in-
frastructure  projects.  And  I  hope  that  you  all  give  it  consideration 
as  an  innovative  option  for  financing  transportation  projects  as  we 
move forward. 

So  again,  delighted  to  welcome  my  former  colleague  here  today, 
Mr. Chairman. And the President couldn’t have made a better pick 
for  this  job.  And  I  look  forward  to  working  with  him  and  with  the

members of this committee as we take on many of these big trans-
portation challenges. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you Senator. And now, Senator Udall? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TOM UDALL, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO 

Senator  UDALL.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Rockefeller. 
And  thank  you  for  allowing  us  to  participate  today.  And  I  also 
thank  the  Ranking  Member.  I’m  honored  to  be  on  this  committee. 
I’m  going  to,  I  think,  enjoy  it  very  much  just  by  the  beginning 
we’ve had here today. 

And  I  want  to  say  to  Ray  LaHood,  my  former  colleague  in  the 
House  of  Representatives.  I  think  this  is  an  excellent  nomination 
by  Barack  Obama.  I  remember  the  years  working  with  you,  Ray, 
in the House on a variety of issues, whether it was renewable elec-
tricity or many other issues where you reached across the aisle. 

But  one  of  the  things  that  impressed  me  the  most,  in  addition 
to what Roger Wicker said in terms of you heading up those bipar-
tisan retreats that we had, trying to bring both sides together, was 
that  of  my  10  years  in  the  House,  eight  of  them  the  Republicans 
were in the majority, and when the Republicans are in the majority 
the  Speaker  has  the  chair  and  you  were  in  the  Speaker’s  chair 
many  times.  And  as  House  members  know  usually  when  you  get 
to  a  very  difficult  vote,  a  tough  vote,  you  want  somebody  in  the 
chair who’s fair, who’s firm. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator UDALL. Well, this is—I’m going to keep talking, Ray any-
way.  This  is  a—I  don’t  know  what  kind  of  signal  we’re  being  sent, 
but anyways. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  UDALL.  But  as  the  Chair  you  were  known  as  someone 
who  was  fair,  someone  who  allowed  openness  and  the  ability  to 
speak,  but  wouldn’t  put  up  with  any  nonsense,  and  you  would  use 
the gavel when it was appropriate. I think there was a tremendous 
amount of respect for you the way you assumed the role as Speaker 
Pro Tem. So I wanted my colleagues to know that. 

A  couple  of  things  that  I  hope  you’ll  talk  about  as  we  get  into 

the questioning that I’d just like to raise briefly. 

One is as we move forward on transportation you obviously have 
a  very  significant  agency.  You’ve  got  60,000  people,  billions  of  dol-
lars.  When  we  move  forward  in  transportation  we’re  going  to  be 
trying to be more efficient, trying to do things in a way where we’re 
greener and have fewer greenhouse gases. 

And  it  seems  to  me,  as  you  look  at  your  Department,  as  we 
spend  every  dollar,  we’re  going  to  need  to  analyze  what  impact 
we’re  having  on  the  environment,  on  the  air,  on  greenhouse  gas 
emissions.  Are  we  doing  it  the  most  effectively  we  can?  So  that’s 
one area I hope you’ll speak to as we get into the debate here. 

And  when  we  talk  about  efficiency  one  of  the  interesting  things 
that’s  been  done  in  my  State  of  New  Mexico,  like  many  of  the 
Western States, we’re big, we have many highways. Governor Rich-
ardson  has  proposed  a  new  commuter  rail  which  now  runs  almost 
100  miles,  called  the  Rail  Runner  from  Belen,  New  Mexico  up  to 
Santa Fe. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

22 

And so I think when we talk about efficiency we’re going to have 
to  be  analyzing  whether  we  invest  more  in  rail  or  do  we  invest 
more  in  roads?  Do  we  invest  more  in  waterways  or  do  we  invest 
more  in  roads?  And  I  hope  that  your  early  analysis  is  to  find  out 
if  you  have  the  capabilities  to  analyze  what’s  the  best  way  to  do 
that? 

So with that I want to welcome you. And I am sure that you are 
going  to  get  a  resounding  vote  whenever  we  get  an  opportunity  to 
do that because you have such an incredible career. And one of the 
final things, you come from the seat of Everett Dirksen. So I think 
that says something about seats generating bipartisanship. 

I  mean  when  he  was  over  here  in  the  Senate  he  worked  with 
LBJ  and  the  two  of  them  forged  a  great  bipartisan  coalition  to 
move  our  country  forward.  So  that’s  a  great  tradition,  Abraham 
Lincoln,  Everett  Dirksen  and  Ray  LaHood.  So  thank  you  very 
much, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Udall. Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much.  Con-
gressman  LaHood  and  Secretary-Designate  LaHood,  thank  you  for 
being  here.  I’m  not  going  to  be  able  to  stay  for  questions.  I  regret 
that. But by now you are aware that we’ve called you over here to 
talk to you. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  DORGAN.  At  some  length,  as  a  matter  of  fact.  I’m  going 

to be mercifully brief. But I want to say two things. 

I’m very interested in the Essential Air Services. You and I have 
had  a  long  conversation  in  my  office  about  these  issues.  I’m  very 
interested in Amtrak and I’m very interested in the training of air 
traffic  controllers  and  how  we’re  using  our  university  facilities 
across the country to do that. 

I  want  to  especially  mention  to  you  that  the  Transportation  De-
partment  recently  headed  by  the  departed  Secretary,  I  think,  was 
very  arrogant  in  the  way  they  dealt  with  a  very  important  issue. 
And that is the issue of allowing long-haul Mexican trucks into this 
country.  They  indicated  it  was  necessary  because  of  NAFTA.  That 
was not the case at all. It just wasn’t the case. 

The  Inspector  General  of  the  Department  of  Transportation  said 
that  in  Mexico  there  is  no  centralization  of  drivers’  records  that 
someone  could  determine.  There  are  no  vehicle  inspection  reports, 
no  centralized  records.  There  are  no  accident  reports,  no  central-
ized records. 

There  is  no  way  that  we  are  ready  to  have  long  haul  Mexican 
trucks moving across the byways of this country. This Administra-
tion did a pilot project. This Congress, just over a year ago, passed 
legislation prohibiting it. The Secretary of Transportation indicated 
she  didn’t  care  very  much  what  this  Congress  thought.  They  were 
going to continue the pilot project anyway. 

Just to show you the absurdity of this. It is required that a Mexi-
can  long-haul  truck  driver  be  fluent  in  English  in  order  to  be  able 
to drive on the roads of this country. And they determine fluent in 
English  as  a  situation  where  if  you  held  up  a  road  sign  such  as  a 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

23 

stop  sign  or  a  yield  sign,  if  that  driver  can  answer  what  that  sign 
is, in Spanish, they’re declared to be fluent in English. So much for 
careful concern about safety on the American roadways. 

I  would  fully  expect  within  the  first  2  months  or  so,  Mr.  Con-
gressman, that the new President and the new Secretary of Trans-
portation will revoke that pilot project. The Congress has requested 
them  to  do  so,  passed  legislation,  and  I  fully  expect  to  see  action 
from  the  new  Secretary  of  Transportation  that  complies  with  the 
law. 

You  and  I  have  had  a  long  conversation  about  that.  I  recognize 
at least part of that decision will be made in the White House. But 
I  appreciate  the  fact  that  I  think  you  were  on  the  side  of  those  of 
us  when  you  were  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  on  the  side  of 
those  of  us  who  attempted  to  pass  legislation  to  shut  that  pilot 
project down. 

So  I  mention  that  because  it  has  to  do  with  the  safety  on  Amer-
ican  roadways.  It  has  to  do  with  the  misinterpretation  of  NAFTA. 
And I think a pretty ham-handed approach by the Treasury, by the 
Transportation Secretary, I should say, in the way it was handled. 
Finally  let  me  just  say  I  am  very  pleased  by  your  nomination.  I 
told  you  that  I  have  great  respect  for  you.  And  for  those  who  are 
in the front row supporting you, including Bob Michel. 

I  thank  you  for  being  willing  to  serve  this  new  Administration. 
And  I  think  all  of  us  on  this  committee  are  excited  about  your 
stewardship.  And  I  believe  you  will  be  confirmed  and  I  look  for-
ward to working with you very much. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Dorgan.  Senator  DeMint  to 

be followed by Senator Klobuchar. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator  DEMINT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Ray,  again,  thank 
you  for  being  willing  to  do  this.  I  appreciate  you  coming  by  my  of-
fice  and  our  conversation  I  think  stimulated  a  lot  of  my  thinking 
and  as  we  talked  about  the  need  for  our  Transportation  Depart-
ment to have bigger vision, longer-term ideas than just year-to-year 
projects. 

As  you  and  I  know  when  the  Department  was  formed  it  was  es-
sentially  to  build  an  interstate  highway  system  which  is  pretty 
much  complete  at  this  point.  There’s  still  certainly  a  role  for  Fed-
eral roads, but as you know the Department of Transportation has 
got increasingly involved with state and local roads and regulations 
and  funding.  And  I’m  afraid  at  the  expense  of  that  bigger  vision 
that it was started with. 

You  and  I  talked  a  little  bit  about  the  possibilities  of  devolving 
some  of  the  Federal  role  for  highways  and  then  looking  at  a 
grander vision. Perhaps of a passenger rail system that could take 
some  of  the  pressure  off  of  our  aviation  system  and  our  highways. 
And I would look forward to working with you on those things. 

Unfortunately because of our financial situation as a country it’s 
unrealistic to think we can continue to add without looking at ways 
we  might—can  subtract.  Certainly  our  Nation  can  give  no  less  at-
tention  to  our  roads  and  our  infrastructure.  But  there  probably  is 
a  greater  role  the  states  can  play  as  we  look  at  different  ways  to 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

24 

fund  funding  long  term  as  gasoline  becomes  less  and  less  the 
source of energy for transportation. 

So  I’d  love  to  hear  more  of  your  thoughts  about  maybe  a  new 
paradigm for the transportation system. Because we don’t need the 
Federal Government now to deal with secondary roads and bridges. 
We  certainly  need  to  challenge  the  states  to  do  a  better  job  with 
that. 

But,  and  the  other  thing  I’d  just  like  you  to  be  thinking  about, 
if I have a chance to ask a question, I will. As you know there has 
been  much  disagreement  about  earmarks  or  projects  that  we  pick 
as Congressmen and Senators and send over to the Transportation 
Department.  And  I  heard  a  number  of  Congressmen  and  Senators 
say  we  should  not  turn  that  over  to  the  unelected  bureaucrats  of 
which you’re getting ready to become one. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator DEMINT. And from previous Secretaries and not just the 
most  recent,  but  I’ve  heard  of  what  kind  of  dysfunction  it  creates 
when  you  have  hundreds  of  folks  on  this  side  sending  multiple 
projects,  thousands  of  projects  to  your  side.  And  it  makes  it  in-
creasingly  difficult  to  implement  a  coherent  Federal  plan.  I’d  love 
to hear your comments later on that because President Obama has 
made  it  clear  he  would  like  to  eliminate  all  or  part  of  the  ear-
marks. And so that’s something certainly I’d like to hear your phi-
losophy on. 

So with that Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator DeMint. Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman  and 
again, congratulations on your new position. And I want to tell you 
one  of  your  first  acts  of  leadership  was  to  allow  this  room  to  be 
used by the Fergus Falls, Minnesota marching band on Monday. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  in  perfect  formation  as  your  staff  will 
tell  you,  they  filled  up  this  entire  room  and  did  Yankee  Doodle 
Dandy. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  so  I  believe  that’s  in  honor  of  your 

Chairmanship. 

Thank you so much, Representative LaHood for being here. I en-
joyed our meeting. We care a lot about transportation in my state. 
I  think  you  mentioned  you  were  there  for  the  Republican  Con-
vention  this  summer.  And  saw  firsthand  some  of  the  work  we’re 
doing including that quick repair we did of the I–35W bridge. Cer-
tainly  that  brought  home  to  me  the  importance  of  transportation 
funding  when  we  have  something  like  a  quarter  of  America’s 
600,000  bridges  that  have  aged  so  much  that  their  physical  condi-
tion  or  ability  to  withstand  current  traffic  levels  is  simply  inad-
equate. 

I  said  the  day  that  the  bridge  fell  down  that  a  bridge  just 
shouldn’t  fall  down  in  the  middle  of  America,  not  a  six-lane  high-
way,  not  a  bridge  that  is  just  six  blocks  from  my  home  where  13 
people  died  in  this  tragedy.  I  think  we  discussed  the  fact  that  fix-

ing  these  bridges  and  roads  and  other  infrastructure  rail  won’t  be 
easy.  But  I  would  say  that  will  be  my  leading  concern  as  Senator 
Hutchison  so  eloquently  discussed  at  the  beginning  of  her  opening 
statement. 

Second,  the  FAA  expects  the  number  of  passengers  who  fly  in 
U.S.  commercial  carriers  to  exceed  an  astounding  one  billion  pas-
sengers by 2015, up from 740 million passengers in 2006. We need 
to  be  prepared.  I  appreciate  the  Chairman’s  leadership  on  this 
issue and the work that this committee has done. 

Clearly  modernizing  our  air  traffic  control  system  should  be  a 
key  priority.  I’d  say  our  new  President  is  pretty  good  with  tech-
nology,  still  wanting  to  hold  on  to  his  BlackBerry,  and  I’m  very 
hopeful that he will see this as a priority as well. 

We also need to ensure that the FAA is employing a well trained 
group of air traffic controllers. Today’s air traffic controllers, as you 
know,  are  retiring  in  record  numbers.  And  those  who  remain  are 
overworked. In the coming years we need to hire and retain a suffi-
cient number of air traffic controllers, and train them to do the im-
portant work that we demand of them. 

Finally  to  look  at  our  transportation  options  and  the  need  to 
have  more  mass  transit  clearly  part  of  this  will  be  railroads.  I 
missed Senator Lautenberg’s opening, but I’m sure he stressed the 
importance of Amtrak. 

One other issue I wanted to mention is the captive shipper issue. 
In my state, like Senator Thune’s state and others, we have a num-
ber  of  small  businesses  and  large  businesses  that  rely  on  our  rail-
roads. Railroad competition has all but disappeared. 

There  were  63  Class  I  railroads  operating  in  the  United  States 
three decades ago. Today only seven remain with four of them con-
trolling over 90 percent of the rail freight. That would be fine if the 
rates  were  acceptable.  What  we  see  unfair  rates  for  captive  ship-
pers  that  are  at  the  end  of  the  line,  the  way  it’s  priced.  And  it’s 
very difficult under the current system for them to challenge these 
rates  in  any  way.  So  that’s  something  that  I’d  like  to  pursue.  Sen-
ator  Dorgan  and  I  and  others  have  a  bill  that  we’re  pushing. 
There’s  also  another  bill  in  the  Judiciary  committee.  And  I’ll  hope 
you’ll look at that. 

In  his  1963  memoir  President  Eisenhower  said  of  the  interstate 
highway  system,  ‘‘More  than  any  single  action  by  the  government 
since  the  end  of  the  war,  this  one  would  change  the  face  of  Amer-
ica. It’s impact on the American economy, the jobs it would produce 
in  manufacturing  and  construction.  The  rural  areas  it  would  open 
up was beyond calculation.’’ 

He  was  right  then.  And  I’m  hopeful  as  we  look  at  this  economic 
recovery package and the work that we need to do in the Transpor-
tation bill that he will be right today. It’s our responsibility to work 
in a bipartisan manner on this issue. Certainly your nomination as 
a  Republican  Congressman  by  this  President  to  this  position  is  a 
symbol of that. 

So  thank  you  very  much.  And  we  look  forward  to  working  with 

you. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Klobuchar.  I  just  wanted  to 
reiterate  for  a  few  of  you  who  came  in  after  I  made  my  opening

remarks.  We’re  going  to  have  two  new  procedures  in  this  com-
mittee. 

One is that at the beginning of any hearing, where there are wit-
nesses,  I  and  Senator  Kay  Bailey  Hutchison  will  have  opening 
statements.  But  I  think  it  is  not  a  good  use  of  our  time  to  have 
every  single  member  make  an  opening  statement.  Why  do  I  say 
that?  Because  I  think  it  encourages  people  to  suddenly  find  other 
meetings  they  have  to  go  to  or  people  look  at  who’s  going  to  be 
speaking  ahead  of  them  or  get  some  idea  of  that  and  they  decide 
they just don’t—— 

I  want  this  to  be  a  committee  which  is  immediate,  where  people 
feel  that  if  they  show  up  on  time  there’s  a  reward  for  that.  That 
we  hold  conversation  to  substance,  not  that  any  opening  state-
ments  are  lacking  in  substance,  but  that  can  all  come  out  during 
the point of questioning. And as you’ve heard today a lot of opening 
statements  have  gotten  to  some  of  the  questions  that,  Congress-
man, you will be asked. 

The  other—so  I  hope  that  you  will  accept  that.  And  the  second 
is  that  I  think  that  what  we  need  to  do  here  is  to  have  an  order 
of arrival in terms of speaking. I think it’s fair. 

Some  committees  use  seniority.  And  I  just  don’t  think  that 
makes a whole lot of sense. I think when somebody gets here before 
somebody  else  then  that  person  ought  to  be  able  to  ask  a  question 
when  it  comes  time  for  questioning  before  somebody  else.  And  so 
that  will  be  the  order  of  the  day  if  that  meets  with  the  approval 
of my distinguished Ranking Member. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  I  do  agree.  And  I  do  think  people  will  have 
a chance to question and we’ll get to the questions, Senator, not to 
mention the witnesses now and in the future would have a chance 
to talk. 

The CHAIRMAN. Alright. It’s Congressman LaHood, isn’t it? 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. We—yes. 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. And what’s the position again? 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  With  great  respect,  sir,  we  welcome  your  testi-

mony. 
STATEMENT OF HON. RAY LAHOOD, SECRETARY-DESIGNATE, 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr. LAHOOD. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I know 
that you’re all very busy here today. There are a lot of things going 
on. 

I  want  to  personally  thank  Senator  Durbin,  my  senior  Senator, 
who I have great respect for and he’s mentioned the great working 
relationship that he and I have had in so many different areas and 
also my mentor and former boss, Bob Michel for the introductions. 
And  Mr.  Chairman  all  of  the  members  have  a  copy  of  my  state-
ment.  And  because  of  the  busy  schedule  you  all  have,  if  you  want 
to  just  put  my  statement  in  the  record.  I’d  be  happy  to  respond  to 
your  questions  now  so  that  everybody  that’s  here  and  has  to  go  to 
another  meeting  would  have  a  chance  to  ask  the  questions  that 
they would like.

The  CHAIRMAN.  No,  no  Congressman.  You’ve  got  to  encourage 

27 

good behavior here. 

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. So we need your opening statement. 
Mr.  LAHOOD.  Chairman  Rockefeller,  Ranking  Member 
Hutchison,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it’s  an  honor  for  me  to  ap-
pear  before  you  as  President  Obama’s  candidate  for  the  United 
States Secretary of Transportation. Today I will tell you a little bit 
about  myself,  communicate  my  vision  for  leading  the  Department 
if  I’m  confirmed  and  most  importantly  hear  about  the  issues  you 
feel are important. Before doing this however, I want to emphasize 
two  principles  I  will  bring  to  everything  I  do  at  the  Department, 
if confirmed. 

First is openness. That means an open door to you, to your Sen-
ate  colleagues,  to  my  former  colleagues  in  the  House  and  to  all 
Americans  who  depend  on  and  care  about  our  transportation  sys-
tem.  This  was  a  basic  principle  of  President  Obama’s  campaign. 
And it will be a watchword for me at USDOT if confirmed. No one 
person  or  agency  has  all  the  knowledge,  insight  or  perspective 
needed  so  I  will  hear  what  people  have  to  say  before  decisions  are 
made. 

The  second  principle  I’ve  lived  by  all  of  my  public  service  career 
is  fairness.  If  I’m  confirmed  I  will  have  the  unusual  perspective  of 
being  a  Republican  in  a  Democratic  Administration.  This  gives  me 
a  real  appreciation  of  the  value  of  listening  to  all  sides  when  dis-
putes arise and projects are reviewed. I hope you take my selection 
as  a  signal  of  the  President’s  commitments  to  focusing  on  policy, 
rather than partisanship. 

There  are  no  Republican  or  Democratic  transportation  issues. 
There are national issues that affect us all. While my primary mis-
sion,  if  confirmed,  will  be  to  bring  President  Obama’s  priorities  to 
the Department and see them effectively implemented. I will do so 
with  a  commitment  to  fairness  across  regional  lines  and  across 
party  lines.  And  I  will  do  so  in  consultation  with  Congress,  Gov-
ernors and local officials. 

Now,  a  little  about  myself.  For  14  years,  I’ve  had  the  honor  of 
representing  my  hometown  of  Peoria,  Illinois,  and  the  20  counties 
of the 18th District of Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
This  District  was  previously  represented  by  among  others,  Abra-
ham  Lincoln,  Everett  Dirksen  and  Bob  Michel.  I  served  on  the 
Transportation  and  Infrastructure  Committee  for  6  years  and  the 
Appropriations  Committee  for  8  years.  I  also  served  in  the  Illinois 
House of Representatives. 

In one form or another I have worked for government and public 
service for 30 years. As I said before my primary goal, if confirmed 
will be effective implementation of President Obama’s priorities. As 
I see it this means a strong focus in at least four areas. 

First,  safety.  On  the  roads,  on  the  rails,  in  the  air  and  on  the 
water.  This  has  been  and  must  continue  to  be  the  central  focus  of 
USDOT. 

This  goal  must  guide  everything  done  by  both  the  leadership  of 
the  Department  and  its  workforce  who  will  be  our  partners  in  ev-
erything  we  do.  I  know  the  Committee  established  this  goal  when 
it  created  the  Department  and  is  dedicated  to  the  success  of  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

safety mission. If confirmed, you can rely on me for the same dedi-
cation. 

28 

Second,  is  the  economy.  I  do  not  need  to  tell  anyone  here  about 
the severe economic challenges we face. 2.6 million jobs lost in 2008 
and unfortunately more to come in 2009. 

The  President  and  his  economic  team  have  spoken  about  the 
need  for  quick  action  and  the  economic  recovery  plan  responds  di-
rectly  to  that  need.  Transportation  is  a  big  part  of  that  plan.  And 
one of my first tasks, if confirmed, will be to manage the open and 
effective use of those funds. 

But  job  creation  cannot  be  the  only  goal  for  these  investments. 
As  we  attend  to  our  immediate  challenges  we  must  keep  watch  on 
longer-term  results.  The  most  compelling  reason  for  infrastructure 
investment is the lasting economic and social benefit it brings over 
decades and even generations. 

Much of our economic strength is built on the wise infrastructure 
investments  made  by  our  predecessors.  And  so  at  a  minimum  we 
cannot  let  the  assets  we  inherit  fall  apart.  I  am  committed  to  in-
vestments  that  will  help  bring  the  country’s  transportation  assets 
up to a state of excellent repair. 

Even  as  we  repair  what  we  have  we  also  must  shape  the  econ-
omy of the coming decades by building new infrastructure. We need 
to  leave  something  of  value  to  those  who  come  after  us.  This  work 
must  be  done  with  an  eye  toward  our  competitive  position  in  the 
world by investing in things like better freight movement. 

But it must also recognize the third major policy focus, our trans-
portation  system  and  the  development  it  enables  must  be  sustain-
able. We must acknowledge the new reality of climate change. This 
has  implications  in  all  areas,  the  inner  city,  rail  and  mass  transit 
funding  in  the  economic  recovery  plan  are  a  part  of  the  equation, 
but only a part. Sustainability must permeate all we do from high-
ways  and  transit  to  aviation  and  ports.  President  Obama  is  com-
mitted to this principle and so am I. 

Fourth  is  a  strong  focus  on  people  and  communities  where  they 
live  and  work.  This  can  take  many  forms.  In  aviation  it  means  a 
commitment to the passengers. An aviation system focused on safe-
ty,  convenience  and  confidence  of  the  traveling  public  is  a  success-
ful one. 

For  surface  transportation  it  implies  a  commitment  to  the  prin-
ciples  that  some  refer  to  as  livability.  That  is  investing  in  ways 
that  respect  the  unique  character  of  each  community.  The  era  of 
one-size-fits-all  projects  must  give  way  to  one  where  preserving 
unique community characteristics, be they rural or urban, is a pri-
mary  goal  rather  than  an  afterthought.  And  I  intend  to  make  liv-
able  communities  a  big  part  of  what  we’re  going  to  do,  hopefully 
under reauthorization and in some other areas. 

These  four  areas:  safety,  the  economy,  sustainability  and  liv-
ability  will  be  major  priorities  for  me  if  I’m  confirmed.  But  what-
ever  our  goals  may  be  we  will  not  achieve  them  unless  policy  and 
investments are driven by outcomes. A key challenge for those who 
craft  the  Nation’s  transportation  programs,  that  is,  all  of  us  here 
today,  will  be  to  link  decision-making  to  performance  at  all  levels. 
This will require a new commitment to measure performance, as 
was  called  for  in  the  recent  report  of  the  National  Surface  Trans-

portation Policy and Revenue Commission and to adjust our course 
where progress is too slow. Performance measurement is key to as-
suring  that  new  money  is  invested  wisely  and  the  public  has 
enough confidence in our work to support continued investment. 

To  conclude,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  again.  I  want  to  work 
with  this  committee  going  forward.  And  I  will  respond  to  your 
questions. Thank you, sir. 

[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Mr. 

LaHood follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. RAY LAHOOD, SECRETARY-DESIGNATE, 

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Chairman  Rockefeller,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison,  Members  of  the  Committee, 
it is an honor for me to appear before you today as President Obama’s designee for 
U.S.  Secretary  of  Transportation.  Today  I  hope  I  can  tell  you  a  little  about  myself, 
communicate  to  you  my  vision  for  leading  the  Department,  if  I  am  confirmed,  and 
hear about the issues you see facing America’s transportation system. 

Before  getting  to  these  specifics,  however,  I  would  like  to  emphasize  two  over-
arching  principles  I  will  bring  to  everything  I  do  at  the  Department  if  I  am  con-
firmed. 

The  first  is  openness.  That  means  an  open  door  to  you  and  your  Senate  col-
leagues,  to  my  former  colleagues  in  the  House,  and  to  all  Americans  who  depend 
on and care about our transportation system. This was a basic principle of President 
Obama’s  campaign,  and  it  will  be  a  watchword  for  me  at  USDOT,  if  I  have  the 
honor  to  lead  the  Department.  I  know  that  no  one  person  or  agency  can  have  all 
the knowledge, insight or perspective needed, and so I will want to hear what people 
have to say before policy is set or decisions are made. 

The  second  is  a  principle  I  have  tried  to  live  by  all  through  my  career—fairness. 
If I am confirmed, I will have the somewhat unusual perspective of being a Repub-
lican  in  a  Democratic  administration.  This  will  give  me  a  heightened  appreciation 
of  the  need  to  listen  to  all  sides  when  disputes  arise  and  projects  are  reviewed.  I 
hope you will take my selection as a signal of the President’s commitment to focus-
ing  his  energies  on  policy  rather  than  partisanship.  I  think  we  all  recognize  that 
there  are  no  Republican  or  Democratic  transportation  issues;  these  are  national 
issues that affect us all. 

While  my  primary  mission  if  I  am  confirmed  will  be  to  bring  President  Obama’s 
priorities  to  the  Department  and  see  them  effectively  implemented,  I  will  do  so  al-
ways  with  a  commitment  to  fairness,  across  regional  lines,  across  party  lines,  and 
between people who come to the issues with different perspectives. 

Now  a  little  about  myself.  For  the  last  14  years  I  have  had  the  honor  of  rep-
resenting my home town of Peoria and the 20 counties of the 18th District of Illinois 
in  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives—a  community  previously  represented  by, 
among  others,  Abraham  Lincoln  and  Everett  Dirksen.  I  served  on  the  Transpor-
tation  and  Infrastructure  Committee  for  6  years  and  on  the  Appropriations  Com-
mittee  after  that.  Before  being  elected  to  Congress,  I  worked  for  the  previous  rep-
resentative for the 18th District, Republican Leader Bob Michel, who I’m sure many 
of  you  know.  I  also  served  in  the  Illinois  House  of  Representatives.  In  one  form  or 
another I have worked in government for more than 30 years. 

As  I  said  before,  my  primary  goal  at  the  Department,  if  confirmed,  will  be  effec-
tive  implementation  of  President  Obama’s  national  priorities  for  transportation.  In 
doing  this  I  will  work  closely  with  Congress  and  the  Nation’s  Governors  and  local 
elected  officials.  As  I  see  it,  this  will  require  a  strong  focus  in  at  least  four  areas. 
First is the economy. I do not need to tell anyone here about the severe economic 
challenges  we  face—more  than  a  million  jobs  lost  in  2008  and  unfortunately  more 
to come in 2009. The President and the members of his economic team have spoken 
extensively about the need for quick action, and the economic recovery and renewal 
plan currently under discussion responds directly to this need. Transportation infra-
structure is a substantial part of that plan, and one of my first and most important 
tasks, if confirmed, will be to manage the effective use of those funds. 

But  job  creation  cannot  be  the  only  goal  for  these  investments.  As  we  attend  to 
our  immediate  challenges,  we  must  keep  watch  on  longer  term  results.  The  most 
compelling  reason  for  infrastructure  investment  is  the  lasting  economic  and  social 
benefit  it  brings  over  decades  and  even  generations.  Indeed,  much  of  our  economic 
success  in  recent  decades  has  been  built  on  the  wise  infrastructure  investments

30 

made by our predecessors. And so at a minimum, we cannot let the assets we inher-
ited fall apart. Accordingly, I am committed to supporting investments that will help 
bring the country’s transportation assets up to a state of good repair. 

Even as we repair what we have, we must begin shaping the economy of the com-
ing  decades  by  building  new  infrastructure.  We  need  to  leave  something  of  value 
to  those  who  come  after  us.  This  work  must  be  done  with  an  eye  toward  our  com-
petitive  position  in  the  world,  by  investing  in  things  like  better  freight  movement. 
But it must also recognize a second major policy focus: our transportation system 
and the development it enables must be sustainable. We must acknowledge the new 
reality  of  climate  change.  This  has  implications  for  all  areas;  investments  in  inter-
city  rail  and  mass  transit,  as  called  for  in  the  economic  recovery  and  reinvestment 
plan,  are  part  of  the  equation,  but  only  part.  Sustainability  must  be  a  principle  re-
flected in all our infrastructure investments, from highways and transit to aviation 
and ports. President Obama is committed to this principle and so am I. 

Third is a strong focus on people and the communities where they live and work. 
This  can  take  many  forms.  In  aviation,  it  means  a  commitment  to  the  end  user  of 
our  aviation  system:  the  passenger.  An  aviation  system  that  focuses  on  the  safety, 
convenience and confidence of the traveling public will be a successful system. 

In our surface transportation programs, it implies a commitment to the principles 
that  some  refer  to  as  livability;  that  is,  investing  in  a  way  that  recognizes  the 
unique  character  of  each  community.  The  era  of  one-size-fits-all  transportation 
projects  must  give  way  to  one  where  preserving  and  enhancing  unique  community 
characteristics, be they rural or urban, is a primary mission of our work rather than 
an afterthought. 

And  finally,  I  am  mindful  that  safety—on  the  road,  on  the  rails,  in  the  air,  and 
on the water—has always been and must continue to be the central focus of the De-
partment of Transportation. This goal must guide everything done by both the lead-
ership of the Department and its work force, who will be our partners in everything 
we  do.  I  know  the  Committee  established  this  goal  when  it  worked  to  create  the 
Department and has been dedicated to the success of the safety mission throughout 
its history. If confirmed, you can rely on me for the same dedication. 

These  four  areas—economic  health,  sustainability,  a  focus  on  people  and  commu-
nities,  and  safety—will  be  major  priorities  for  me  if  I  am  confirmed  because  I  be-
lieve  a  transportation  system  that  meets  these  goals  is  vital  to  our  long  term  na-
tional  interest.  The  tools  the  Congress  has  given  to  the  Department  vary—from 
grants, to regulation, to research and technology, to informing the public on issues. 
In every case, I will seek to use those tools to pursue these goals. 

But  whatever  our  goals  may  be,  we  will  not  achieve  them  unless  our  policy  and 
investment  decisions  are  driven  by  outcomes.  A  key  challenge  for  those  who  craft 
and  manage  the  Nation’s  transportation  programs—that  is,  all  of  us  here  today— 
will be to link decision-making to performance at all levels. This will require a new 
commitment to measuring performance in real time, as was called for in the recent 
report of the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Commission, and 
to adjusting our course where progress is not rapid enough. The practice of perform-
ance  measurement  will  be  key  to  assuring  both  that  new  money  is  invested  wisely 
and  that  the  public  has  the  confidence  to  continue  supporting  continued  invest-
ments. 

To  conclude  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  again  for  scheduling  this  hearing.  I  would 
like  to  reiterate  my  desire  to  work  with  this  committee  as  policy  and  funding  mat-
ters are debated, and I will be happy to respond to any questions you and the Mem-
bers of the Committee may have.

18.  Given  the  current  mission,  major  programs,  and  major  operational  objectives 
of  the  department/agency  to  which  you  have  been  nominated,  what  in  your  back-
ground  or  employment  experience  do  you  believe  affirmatively  qualifies  you  for  ap-
pointment to the position for which you have been nominated, and why do you wish 
to serve in that position? 

I  have  been  involved  in  the  legislative  process  throughout  much  of  my  life,  first 
as  a  staff  member  and  then  for  many  years  as  an  elected  official.  I  have  seen  how 
government  programs  can  meet  national  objectives  and  improve  the  economy  an 
quality  of  life  at  both  the  national  and  the  local  level.  At  the  same  time,  I  have 
learned  through  my  interactions  with  constituents  how  these  programs  can  fall 
short  of  their  objectives  when  they  become  overly  bureaucratic,  or  lose  sight  of  the 
stakeholders that they are intended to serve. I also know from experience that Fed-
eral  programs  must  collaborate  with  and  support  state  and  local  agencies  in  order 
to be effective. 

During my time on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and then on 
the  Appropriations  Committee,  I  gained  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  Depart-
ment of Transportation’s programs and agencies. I also have served both on the In-
telligence  Committee  and  on  the  Homeland  Security  Appropriations  Subcommittee, 
where  I  became  familiar  with  potential  terrorist  threats  facing  the  transportation 
system, and the countermeasures needed to ensure efficient transportation while en-
hancing security. 

I  look  forward  to  the  challenge  of  leading  the  Department  of  Transportation  at 
a time when it will play a fundamental role in supporting national objectives. Build-
ing  and  improving  our  Nation’s  transportation  infrastructure  has  always  been 
among  my  highest  priorities,  and  over  the  next  few  years,  the  Department  will  be 
challenged to meet this objective to an unprecedented degree. 

19.What  do  you  believe  are  your  responsibilities,  if  confirmed,  to  ensure  that  the 
department/agency  has  proper,  management  and  accounting  controls,  and  what  ex-
perience do you have in managing a large organization? 

Management and accounting controls are critical to the success of any large orga-
nization,  public  or  private,  and  I  am  committed  to  using  my  leadership  in  the  De-
partment of Transportation to assure that such controls are in place. It is my under-
standing  that  the  Department,  over  the  past  decade  or  more,  has  been  a  leader  in 
the  use  of  performance  management  to  set  strategic  objectives  and  measure 
progress toward meeting objectives. The Department’s financial systems also enable 
it  to  obtain  a  clean  and  timely  audit  opinion  on  its  annual  financial  statements.  I 
expect  to  continue  and  expand  these  activities  with  the  strong  support  of  the  De-
partment’s  Inspector  General,  its  Chief  Financial  Office  and  all  of  the  members  of 
the Agency’s leadership team. These officials will clearly understand my high expec-
tations for management performance, and will receive my full support for continued 
progress  of  the  Department  of  Transportation  as  a  recognized  model  for  govern-
mental management. 

While my personal experience does not include direct responsibilities for manage-
ment  in  large  organizations,  my  service  in  the  Congress,  particularly  on  the  House 
Appropriations  Committee,  has  given  me  the  perspective  to  understand  the  impor-
tance  of  sound  management  and  accountability  in  the  use  of  public  funds.  I  want

the  Department  of  Transportation  to  be  seen  as  an  agency  that  effectively  serves 
the will of the public, and does so in a way that ensures transparency to those citi-
zens who wish to understand its internal workings. 

20.  What  do  you  believe  to  be  the  top  three  challenges  facing  the  department/ 

agency, and why? 

I believe that the major challenges facing the Department of Transportation relate 
to  its  support  of  key  national  objectives.  As  I  think  about  the  department’s  future, 
I  want  its  programs  and  activities  to  contribute  to  solutions  in  areas  critical  to  the 
Nation’s future. 

In  the  area  of  the  economy,  efficient  and  safe  infrastructure  is  a  fundamental  re-
quirement for recovery and growth. As a nation, we need to invest in our highways, 
bridges,  ports,  air  and  rail  systems  to  strengthen  user  safety,  bolster  our  long-term 
competitiveness  and  ensure  that  our  economy  achieves  its  growth  potential. 
Through the Department of Transportation’s programs, sound and well managed in-
vestments will move us in the right direction. An aviation system that works effec-
tively is critical to the safe movement of people and goods in the conduct of our eco-
nomic  affairs.  I  believe  we  must  support  that  system  through  the  modernization  of 
air traffic control and by working cooperatively with front line air traffic controllers 
and  maintainers  to  restore  morale  and  improve  working  conditions  within  the  Fed-
eral Aviation Administration. We need also to get on with the development of a rail 
system  that  supports  a  growing  economy  with  high-speed  passenger  rail  and  a 
strengthened  domestic  freight  rail  system.  Leadership  in  the  Department  of  Trans-
portation is needed to set the objectives in these are gain support for the resources 
needed and provide benchmarks to gauge progress. 

In  the  area  of  energy,  the  transportation  system  must  play  a  central  role  in  con-
servation  and  sound  development  of  energy  resources.  Department  of  Transpor-
tation  programs  play  a  major  role  here  as  well.  The  fuel  economy  of  nation’s  auto-
mobile fleet must continue to improve, and I look forward to working within the Ad-
ministration and with the auto industry to achieve this goal. Beyond this, it is time 
to  move  to  a  new  generation  of  vehicles  with  dramatic  improvement  in  energy  use. 
Investing in advanced vehicle technology and development of supportive policies for 
such  vehicles,  including  their  safety  and  the  support  infrastructure  will  be  an  im-
portant  contribution  to  the  national  goals.  So  will  the  Department’s  support  of  effi-
cient  transportation  modes—effective  public  transportation  in  our  cities  and  an 
intercity  passenger  rail  system  that  revitalizes  Amtrak  as  the  foundation  for  high- 
speed rail connections among our regions. Making these initiatives happen is a key 
challenge,  involving  both  resources  and  hands-on  management  and  the  revitaliza-
tion of the Department’s research and development skills. 

Environment is another area where the Department contributes to national goals 
and  where  I  see  a  key  set  of  challenges.  Making  global  warming  a  top  priority  as 
well as dealing with other environmental concerns will require a new level of atten-
tion  for  our  transportation  systems  as  well  as  a  new  mindset  for  the  Department’s 
leadership. Increased energy efficiency in our vehicles and our passenger and freight 
transportation  systems  will  significantly  alleviate  the  problem  of  greenhouse  gases. 
But for the long term, we also need to encourage more livable and sustainable com-
munities,  using  the  resources  of  Departmental  programs  to  new  ends.  For  too  long, 
our  patterns  of  urban  development  have  been  organized  around  the  principle  of 
cheap gasoline. As we invest wisely in the repair and development of our infrastruc-
ture,  we  must  devote  significantly  more  attention  t  investments  that  will  make  it 
easier  for  us  to  walk,  bicycle  and  access  other  transportation  alternatives.  Among 
the key challenges here is the development of close working relationships with other 
Cabinet  agencies  whose  goals  and  programs  overlap  with  those  of  the  Department 
of Transportation.

ATTACHMENT A 

Congressman Ray LaHood (R-Peoria) 

Eighteenth District of Illinois 

Congressman Ray LaHood is serving his seventh and final term representing the 
18th District of Illinois. First elected in 1994, Ray was re-elected to Congress on No-
vember 7, 2006, with over 67 percent of the vote. 

Ray  is  a  former  schoolteacher,  a  long-time  community  leader,  and  has  extensive 
legislative experience, all of which combine to give him a unique perspective on his 
job as a Congressman. 

The  district  Ray  represents  includes  the  hometowns  of  several  significant  Amer-
ican  leaders,  such  as  Abraham  Lincoln,  Everett  Dirksen,  and  Bob  Michel.  In  fact,

the  20  counties  of  the  18th  District  contain  the  same  11  counties  Lincoln  rep-
resented as a Congressman.

Ray serves on the House Appropriations Committee, the panel that oversees Fed-

eral discretionary spending. 

Appropriations Committee Subcommittee Assignments: 
• Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, Ranking Member. 
• Subcommittee on Agricultural, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administra-

tion, and Related Agencies. 

• Subcommittee on Legislative Branch. 
Since his first election, agriculture has been one of Ray’s top priorities. With some 
of  the  finest  farmland  in  the  world,  the  18th  Congressional  District  has  a  tremen-
dous  farming  heritage.  Ray  has  been  a  leader  in  the  promotion  of  ethanol  and  has 
supported  policies  which  are  allowing  unprecedented  expansion  of  ethanol  produc-
tion in Illinois. The Illinois Farm Bureau recognized Ray’s leadership on agriculture 
issues  y  awarding  him  their  highest  honor  in  2005,  the  Charles  B.  Shuman  Distin-
guished Service Award. 

Ray  has  taken  great  pride  in  the  18th  District’s  ties  to  Abraham  Lincoln,  and  he 
has been an advocate for advancing the legacy of the 16th President. Ray authored 
the  law  establishing  the  Abraham  Lincoln  Bicentennial  Commission  to  lay  the 
groundwork for celebrating Lincoln’s 200th birthday in 2009. He has also led efforts 
to  establish  the  highly-successful  Abraham  Lincoln  Presidential  Library  and  Mu-
seum in Springfield. 

Ray  is  viewed  as  a  leading  proponent  for  preserving  the  Illinois  River.  He  led  ef-
forts  to  secure  Illinois’  inclusion  in  the  Conservation  Reserve  Enhancement  Pro-
gram,  a  unique  and  highly  successful  environmental  program  for  the  Illinois  River, 
which has allowed over 100,000 acres to be put into conservation easements. He has 
supported  efforts  to  enhance  the  Chautauqua  National  Wildlife  Refuge  in  Mason 
County, expand the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Fulton County, and create 
the  Hennepin-Hopper  Lakes  backwater  restoration  project.  In  recognition  of  his  ef-
forts  for  the  river,  Ray  was  awarded  the  Frank  Bellrose  Illinois  River  Valley  Con-
servation Award in 2001 from the Illinois Chapter of The Nature Conservancy. 

Ray  has  led  efforts  to  enhance  Illinois’  infrastructure.  He  has  worked  to  secure 
funds to improve local highways, such as the reconstruction of Interstate 74 in Peo-
ria,  the  expansion  of  U.S.  Route  67,  and  completion  of  Route  336.  Ray  has  been  a 
proponent  for  improving  local  airports  through  securing  new  construction  and  ex-
pansion, while also working with officials to increase air service. 

Over  the  years,  Ray  has  been  lauded  by  many  for  his  leadership  on  the  local, 
state,  and  national  levels.  He  is  widely  viewed  as  someone  who  has  a  deep  respect 
for  the  institution  of  Congress  and  who  works  across  party  lines  to  achieve  policy 
goals. 

He  has  led  efforts  to  establish  a  higher  level  of  civility,  decorum,  and  bipartisan-

ship in the House of Representatives. 

His knowledge of Congress and his fair-handed demeanor have enabled him to be 
called  upon  many  times  to  chair  the  House  of  Representatives  during  proceedings 
on contentious issues including the impeachment debate in 1998. 

Locally, Ray has led efforts to work with officials in a collaborative manner to ad-
dress  various  issues  facing  the  communities  of  the  18th  District.  He  regularly  con-
venes  bipartisan  meetings  with  the  area’s  state  representatives  and  senators  and 
often meets with local mayors and other elected officials. Ray’s greatest collaborative 
achievements include the establishment of a Federal health clinic in Peoria, the cre-
ation  of  the  Peoria/NEXT  business  incubator,  and  moving  forward  with  the-con-
struction of the Peoria Riverfront Museum. 

Among  Ray’s  highest  priorities  is  helping  focal  communities  with  various  efforts 
to attract industry and increase employment opportunities. Ray has particularly em-
phasized  rural  development  through  assisting  economic  efforts  and  infrastructure 
improvements in the many rural communities he represents. 

Ray  LaHood  was  born  December  6,  1945,  and  is  a  native  of  Peoria.  He  is  the

Junior  College,  and  Bradley  University.  He  earned  a  B.S.  degree  in  Education  and 
Sociology from Bradley in 1971. In 2000, Ray received an honorary doctorate in Po-
litical Science from Lincoln College. In 2002, Ray received an honorary doctorate in 
Public  Service  from  Eureka  College.  In  2004,  Ray  received  an  honorary  doctorate

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much.  There  are  so  many  ques-
tions to answer. And maybe I will just start with what has already 
been  discussed  by  the  distinguished  Ranking  Member  and  others. 
And  that  is  the  whole  question  of  our  air  traffic  control  system, 
funding for the FAA, getting a reauthorization bill out in time. 

I  have  always  been  stunned.  I  have  a  new  trick  which  I  use 
which  actually  works,  and  that  is  I  say  that  Mongolia  has  a  more

modern air traffic control system than we do. It happens that they 
don’t  have  any  at  all  right  now,  but  they’re  building  one  and  it’s 
digitalized and it runs on GPS. 

We  have  our  old  system  which  we  blithely  accept.  As  we  accept 
enormous  delays  knowing  perfectly  well  that  if  you  could  recon-
figure  runways  at  O’Hare,  which  has  been  done  to  some  extent,  if 
you  had  an  air  traffic  control  system  that  was  digitalized  under 
GPS,  you’d  probably  have  a  one-third  efficiency  pick  up  in  the 
skies. 

Well,  to  do  that  it  costs  money.  And  in  order  to  build  the  new 
air  traffic  control  system  it  obviously  requires  new  money.  Also, 
you  have  to  maintain  the  old  one  as  you’re  building  the  new  one. 
So that’s a double hit. 

Traditionally  the  FAA  has  been  underfunded.  And  traditionally 
many  of  our  programs,  which  we’ll  be  discussing  over  the  coming 
months, have been underfunded. But I’m just interested in your at-
titude,  Representative  LaHood  as  to  this  question  of  NextGen  and 
efficiency in our skies. 

Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Chairman, my top priorities is to find the most 
talented FAA Administrator that we can find, and then recommend 
that  person  to  President  Obama  so  he  can  recommend  that  person 
to the Senate for confirmation. The FAA administrator is one of the 
most important positions in the Department, and we’ve talked a lot 
about that position during my transition. 

We  need  someone  who  can  help  resolve  some  of  these  disputes 
that have taken place between the controllers and the agency. That 
has  to  be  a  priority.  We  have  to  have  people  in  these  TRACONs. 
We have to have FAA employees that like going to work every day 
because  they  have  very  important  jobs.  All  of  us  that  fly  as  often 
as  we  do  want  to  make  sure  that  people  who  are  controlling  air-
craft are satisfied with their work. 

So  I’m  trying  to  find  somebody,  who  is  willing  to  come  into  the 
job,  work  with  the  controllers  to  resolve  the  dispute  and  get  that 
issue  off  the  table  so  that  it  does  not  become  something  that  we 
or  the  President  is  going  to  have  to  deal  with.  That  is  a  top  pri-
ority. 

The next priority in the FAA is obviously NextGen. 
The CHAIRMAN. Can I interrupt for one second? 
Mr. LAHOOD. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. One of the problems, and you brought it up very 
distinctly,  is  how  we  fund  the  new  air  traffic  control  system.  We 
have  a  system  now  wherein,  so  called  legacy  airlines—and  there 
used  to  be  so  many  just  like  trains,  and  now  there  are  many 
fewer—are bearing 92 percent of the cost of running our analog air 
traffic control system. 

Whereas the great majority of airplanes, and I don’t include crop 
dusters or King Airs or anything in that category, but private jets, 
things of this sort have to be treated the same way by an air traffic 
controller,  same  attention,  and  they’re  paying  for  about  8  percent 
of the cost. That doesn’t strike me as entirely fair. 

Do you have thoughts on this? 
Mr.  LAHOOD.  I  do,  Mr.  Chairman.  My  thought  is  that  when  we 
look at NextGen, we need to look at a bigger picture of how we get

47 

to  where  we  want  to  be.  But  then  we  need  to  set  a  very  realistic 
benchmark. 

Based on what I’ve been able to learn from the experts, we need 
to look at how we get the next five to 8 years out in terms of really 
getting  to  NextGen  with  the  idea  that  it’s  going  to  take  much 
longer than that. So that everybody in the industry, everybody that 
uses the equipment, everybody that’s involved in this, realizes that 
we have an attainable short-term goal that fits into the longer-term 
goal  of  getting  to  the  implementation  of  NextGen.  But  this  idea  of 
having  some  kind  of  pie  in  the  sky  idea  for  getting  to  NextGen 
without  an  avenue  to  do  it,  and  I  think  the  avenue  is  in  the  next 
5  to  8  years,  the  industry,  the  controllers,  everybody  knows  this  is 
where we’re going. This is the road map. 

Then  the  overall  goal  is  to  complete  that.  That’s  my  idea  on  it. 
I know this NextGen-technology is not inexpensive, but we have to 
do  it.  There  has  to  be  a  commitment  from  the  Congress,  from  the 
FAA,  and  from  all  the  stakeholders,  to  get  this  done.  The  flying 
public deserves it. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  thank  you,  sir.  And  I’ll  just  close  for  yielding 
to  Senator  Hutchison  that  we  had  a  number  of  these  meetings 
where  we  asked  the  legacy  airlines,  the  general  aviation  commu-
nity, and the various unions involved to get together and figure out 
what  would  be  a  fair  way  to  fund  a  modern  air  traffic  control  sys-
tem and yet have it reflect in some way, the usage of that system. 
And we got nowhere, as you know. 

So  I  just  put  that  on  your  plate  with  some  feeling  and  call  on 

Senator Hutchison. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Representative 

LaHood, do you support the full national Amtrak system? 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Well,  the  bill  that  Congress  passed  last  year  is  a 
very  good  bill  and  I  fully  intend  on  working  with  Congress  to  im-
plement  it.  I  think  it’s  the  way  forward  to  get  us  a  comprehensive 
Amtrak  system  in  this  country.  I’m  not  an  independent  operator 
anymore  because  I  didn’t  get  elected  to  anything  last  November 
but,  during  my  14  years  in  Congress,  I’ve  been  a  strong  supporter 
of  Amtrak.  It’s  the  life  blood  for  many,  many  communities  around 
the country. And I will work with all of you to implement the Am-
trak bill. I think it’s a good bill. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Thank  you.  Toll  roads.  Recently  I  think  we 
have  focused  really  too  strongly,  in  my  opinion,  on  privately-fi-
nanced toll roads to solve the problems of urban congestion. 

And  in  many  instances  this  has  taken  on,  I  think,  abdication  of 
private  property  rights.  I  am  very  concerned  about  our  Federal 
Government  giving  incentives  to  promote  these  and  in  some  in-
stances allowing tolls over every lane of a Federal highway that the 
taxpayers have already built. What is your position on tolling Fed-
eral highways that have already been paid for by the taxpayers for 
as many as 10 and 12 miles every lane? 

I think it is breaking our contract with the people that we would 
have  a  Federal  highway  system  that  would  promote  commerce  be-
cause they are freeways. And I would like to see what your position 
is. And what this Administration will do in regard to these massive 
toll roads.

Mr. LAHOOD. One of our big challenges, Senator, is to find ways 
to  plus  up  the  Highway  Trust  Fund.  All  of  us  who  were  around 
here last year know that we had to provide $8 billion to plus it up. 
We’re going to reauthorize the surface transportation bill this year. 
And there’s not going to be enough money to do all the things that 
we all want to do. 

So,  I  think  we  do  have  to  think  outside  of  the  box,  and  part  of 
thinking outside of the box is the idea that, in building new lanes, 
adding  lanes  on,  or  building  additional  roadways,  we  would  have 
tolling pay for part of that. Now, taking a part of the existing inter-
state  highway,  that  people  are  already  using  and  putting  tolls  on 
that,  I  personally  do  not  think  that  is  a  good  idea.  Obviously,  it’s 
something  that  people  will  talk  about.  But  it’s  not  something  that 
I personally think is a good idea. 

But  I  do  think  the  idea  if  you  want  to  add  an  additional  lane  to 
a road and you want to toll it. If you want to build a bridge, which 
costs an enormous amount of money, I think people ought to think 
about  tolls  on  the  bridge  as  a  way  to  pay  for  it  and  as  a  way  to 
maintain  it.  But  the  idea  of  taking  an  interstate  road  and  putting 
a toll booth on it, I think is not a good idea, Senator. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Well  thank  you.  That’s  the  answer.  I  have 
said that I agree. We should be able to toll a lane to build another 
lane.  But  that  doesn’t  close  the  free  lanes  that  are  there.  And 
you’re keeping the same number of free lanes. 

And  I  also  think  with  local  input  and  approval  tolling  a  bridge 
is fine. I think the key though is that we don’t have a policy in this 
country  of  breaking  the  phase  with  the  taxpayers  who  have  built 
a  Federal  highway  system  and  it  has  taken,  what,  60  years  to  do 
it. And then we stop the freeway and all of a sudden toll. 

It’s  just  the  wrong  public  policy.  So  I  think  you  have  said  you 
agree  with  that.  And  I  certainly  agree  with  you  on  the  distinction 
between closing a lane with tolls and adding another lane. 

Last  question.  Slot  auctions.  This  Department  of  Transportation 
has  gone  out  with  requests  for  proposed  rulemaking  to  auction 
slots  that  have  been  already  paid  for  by  different  airlines,  particu-
larly  in  the  New  York  area,  LaGuardia  and  then  reselling  them 
without the consent of the airline that has already purchased them. 
What  is  your  position  on  that?  And  are  you  looking  at  stopping 
those  auctions  or  going  forward  with  them?  I’d  like  to  have  your 
input. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Senator,  I  think  that,  if  the  idea  is  to  relieve  con-
gestion at a place like LaGuardia, and one way to do it is to elimi-
nate  slots,  I  think  it  kind  of  defeats  the  purpose  then  to  go  back 
and  say  that  you’re  going  to  auction  those  off.  Personally,  again,  I 
don’t  like  that  idea.  I  think  it  defeats  what  you’re  trying  to  do.  If 
you’re really trying to cut down congestion then eliminate the slots. 
But  the  idea  of  then  going  back  and  re-auctioning  them  doesn’t 
make any sense to me. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Thank  you.  I  agree  with  you.  And  I  appre-

ciate that answer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Hutchison.  Senator  Lauten-

berg?

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Again, Represent-
ative LaHood, soon to be, well I won’t preempt the Committee, but 
so far you’re doing pretty good. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Last  year  you  voted  as  a  House  member 
for  my  $13  billion  Amtrak  bill  which  would  greatly  expand  rail 
service  throughout  our  country.  Ray,  can  we  count  on  you  to  fight 
to  get  us  the  full  funding  to  meet  this  law,  to  meet  the  increased 
demand for rail travel that we’re seeing? 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Senator  Lautenberg,  as  a  14  year  member  of  the 
House,  I’ve  been  a  strong  supporter  of  Amtrak.  It’s  the  life  blood 
of  so  many  communities  around  America.  I  will  do  all  that  I  can 
to be helpful to you, and to the Congress to find the funding to im-
plement  what  I  think  is  a  very  good  bill  that  we  all  voted  for  last 
year. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I just wanted to remind you. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Anyway approximately $5 billion from the 
Federal  New  Starts  program  are  expected  to  be  needed  for  transit 
projects around the country in the coming year. But the FTA, Fed-
eral Transit Administration, only has less than $1 billion as a ceil-
ing to commit to these projects. As Secretary would you support in-
creasing  this  authority  so  that  these  projects,  including  a  new  rail 
tunnel  under  the  Hudson  River—and  I  want  to  point  out  to  those 
who  hear  this  that  this  is  not  a  commuter  tunnel.  Commuters  use 
it. 

This is a national priority. It attaches the financial center of the 
world  with  the  rest  of  the  country  with  ease  and  reliability.  And 
we’ve got to make sure that we continue to expand that need. 

I remind everybody that on 9/11, when few things were operating 
to  enable  people  to  get  from  place  to  place,  it  was  Amtrak  that 
brought  people  up  from  Washington  so  that  they  could  see  what 
was  happening  and  act  accordingly.  So  as  Secretary  can  we  count 
on  you  to  support  increasing  this  authority  so  that  these  projects, 
including  the  new  rail  tunnel  under  the  Hudson  River  can  move 
without delay? 

It’s  going  to  provide  immediately  6,000  jobs  which  is  a  mission 
that  this  wonderful  President  of  ours  has  chosen  to  do  and  that  is 
to build employment. So can we count on you? 
Mr. LAHOOD. You can count on me, Senator. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  The  current  FAA  tried  to  redesign  the  air 
routes over our region, New York, New Jersey. These changes have 
created problems including some confusion between pilots and con-
trollers  and  many  instances  of  planes  going  the  wrong  way  after 
takeoff.  I’d  like  your  commitment  to  look  at  this  problem  and  try 
to halt the use of these new routes until the potentially dangerous 
situation is resolved. 

Mr. LAHOOD. Senator, you have my commitment to look at it and 
to instruct the FAA to do all they can to meet with you, your staff 
and  other  people  in  the  region  to  try  and  figure  out  a  solution  to 
the problem. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. OK, safety you said was a principal factor. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Absolutely.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  In  your  view.  Now  I  don’t  know  whether 
this  question  was  asked,  Mr.  Chairman,  while  I  was  out,  but  the 
air traffic controllers have been without a collective bargaining con-
tract  since  2005.  We’re  going  to  count  on  you.  Tell  me  if  you  will 
work with the air traffic controllers, other FAA unions, to get a col-
lective  bargaining  agreement  on  pay  and  working  conditions  in 
place. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Senator,  I  think  two  of  the  most  important  things 
that  the  FAA  Administrator  needs  to  do  is  to  resolve  the  dispute 
and  get  it  off  the  table  for  President  Obama  and  for  all  of  us  and 
get it behind us. I think it’s very important. I think it’s very doable. 
I really do, based on everything I’ve heard. 

Then  of  course,  the  second  most  important  part  of  that  job  is  to 
get  to  NextGen.  We’re  going  to  be  committed  to  getting  an  agree-
ment that people feel they can live with. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well  one  of  the  things  that  I  sense,  and  I 
hope  that  I’m  correct  in  my  analysis,  is  that  you’re  going  to  be  an 
active Secretary of Transportation. 

Mr. LAHOOD. Yes, sir. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  that’s  what  we  want.  We  don’t  like 
spectators  doing  these  jobs.  We  don’t  like  second  guessers  doing 
these jobs. We like leadership. 

I  commend  you.  And  I  look  forward  to  your  continuing  to  move 

through the process. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Lautenberg. Sen-

ator Klobuchar? 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
When  we  met  last  week,  Representative  LaHood,  we  talked  about 
our transportation needs. We talked about thinking outside the box 
when  it  came  to  financing  and  as  Rahm  Emanuel,  I  know  you 
wanted  me  to  quote  him  in  your  confirmation  hearing  here,  has 
said, ‘‘We shouldn’t waste a good crisis.’’ 

Can you give me some out-of-the-box ideas or things that are on 
your  mind,  for  instance  for  replenishing  the  Highway  Trust  Fund, 
how we’re going to do that? That would be a start. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  First  of  all,  I  think  what  Senator  Warner  said 
about public-private partnerships is thinking outside the box. Toll-
ing  of  new  highway  lanes  is  a  different  way  of  thinking  about  it. 
I think of tolling bridges if people need a new bridge. 

We  need  to  think  about  the  kinds  of  opportunities  that  would 
help us pay for the infrastructure needs that we all know are very, 
very  important.  And  we  can  perhaps  use  the  Highway  Trust  Fund 
to  maintain  some  of  the  highways  that  we’ve  built.  But  if  we’re 
going  to  think  innovatively  in  the  reauthorization,  then  those  are 
some  of  the  ways  that  we  need  to  think  about  these  things,  dif-
ferently than just the gasoline tax. 

We know that Amtrak ridership is still way up even though gaso-
line prices have come down. We know, in places like Chicago, that 
people  are  still  using  a  lot  of  mass  transit  even  though  gasoline 
prices  have  come  down.  And  we  know  that  people  are  still  going 
to drive, but the resources to pay for it through the Highway Trust 
Fund is a dinosaur, if you’ll excuse the expression.

It  was  developed  when  Eisenhower  and  the  Congress  came  up 
with  the  idea  of  developing  an  interstate  system.  We’ve  come  far 
afield  of  that  now.  And  so  I’m  willing  to  listen  to  all  these  ideas. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. 
Mr.  LAHOOD.  We  need  to  really  be  creative  about  this,  and  I 

think we can be. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Very good. Thank you. 
The  bridge  Bailey  and  I  discussed.  I  don’t  need  you  to  comment 
exactly  on  it,  but  the  issue  is  that  not  enough  money  has  been  fo-
cused  in  the  states  on  maintaining  bridges  because  it’s  always  fun 
to  build  new  bridges  and  have  a  ribbon  cutting  and  things  like 
that.  And  both  Congressman  Oberstar  and  I  have  been  concerned 
about the fact that not enough of the bridge repair, bridge mainte-
nance  money  goes  into  bridge  maintenance.  Do  you  want  to  com-
ment on that? 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Well,  you  obviously  pointed  that  out  very  well  to 
me.  I’m  certainly  willing  to  look  at  it  and  work  with  you  to  figure 
out  ways  to  make  sure  that  we  maintain  not  only  the  bridges,  but 
also  the  interstate  system,  which  is  a  very  comprehensive  system; 
it is one of the best in the world, if not the best. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Right.  Another  topic,  a  little  different.  I’m 
a strong proponent of high-speed Internet in the economic recovery 
package  that  we’re  considering  right  now  and  there  are  obvious 
issues of people in rural areas not having access. But I understand 
that laying fiber is an expensive undertaking. 

And  so  it  seems  to  me  when  we  embark  on  increased  spending 
on highway projects, we would also be wise to consider ways to cou-
ple  road  construction  and  maintenance  projects  with  the  laying  of 
fiber.  In  other  words  why  dig  up  roads  twice  in  this  difficult  eco-
nomic time when you can kill two birds with one stone. Do you see 
any kind of potential for partnership in this area in the near term 
in  the  Economic  Recovery  package,  but  more  likely  with  the  High-
way  bill  as  we  look  at  transit  funding  and  how  we  can  couple  this 
with incentives to lay the fiber at the same time? 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Again,  as  we  consider  reauthorization,  we  have  to 
think  outside  the  box  and  in  ways  that  we  haven’t  thought  about 
these  issues.  I’ve  been  a  strong  supporter  because  I  come  from  a 
state like Illinois, where it is very rural once you get south of Inter-
state 80. Broadband is very important. 

As  we  build  roads  into  rural  parts  of  states  like  Illinois,  Min-
nesota,  or  Virginia,  we  need  to  figure  out  ways  to  make  sure  that 
people have access to the world. I think that’s what we really ought 
to be thinking about in the reauthorization. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Thank you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Klobuchar.  Senator  Snowe? 
Senator  SNOWE.  Thank  you.  Returning  to  the  question  on  the 
CAFE  standards  because  that  clearly  is  going  to  be  one  of  the 
major  issues  that  you’ll  be  confronting.  As  you  know  that  the  pre-
vious  Administration  did  not  issue  the  ruling  for  the  model  year 
2011. Have you had a chance to evaluate this issue? 

And I say this because I know that there will be concerns raised 
well  you  know  this  maybe  not  the  appropriate  time  given  where 
the  state  of  the  auto  industry.  But  that’s  just  precisely  what  got

the  auto  industry  in  trouble.  Financially  were  not  prepared.  You 
know,  they  weren’t  on  the  vanguard  of  change  in  innovation  tech-
nologically  to  respond  to  the  marketplace  when,  you  know,  prices 
of gasoline skyrocketed and didn’t have the available models for hy-
brid technology to any great extent to fuel efficient vehicles. 

So  we  received  cost-benefit  ratios  from  the  National  Highway 
Transportation  Safety  Administration  yesterday  both  the  light 
truck  and  automobiles  and  clearly  an  indication  that  the  benefits 
outweigh  the  cost  through  the  model  year  2015.  And  I  certainly 
would  like  to  share  this  information  as  something  that  you  all  be 
able  to  receive.  But  would  like  to  get  your  input  in  terms  of  how 
you  view  this  issue  and  how  you’re  prepared  to  address  it  as  the 
next Secretary of Transportation. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Senator  Snowe,  when  I  was  in  the  House  I  prob-
ably  voted  maybe  eight  or  ten  times  on  amendments  to  raise  the 
CAFE  standards.  I  think  it  is  one  way  for  us  to  really  overcome 
some  of  the  pollution  that  exists  around  the  country.  However, 
what  is  more  important  than  my  own  votes,  is  that  President 
Obama,  as  you  know,  is  very  strong  in  this  area  and  has  spoken 
out  on  it  on  a  number  of  occasions.  They’re  not  going  to  have  to 
push me very hard from the White House to do this, but I assume 
that I’ll be hearing from them very soon. 

We’re  going  to  meet  the  standard.  And  we  should.  It  has  to  be 
a  part  of  the  overall  plan  here  to  eliminate  pollution,  the  greening 
of  America  and  get  the  American  car  manufacturers  in  the  game 
here, with the reality that they need to be producing American cars 
and that get much better mileage. 

Senator SNOWE. Well, I appreciate that because it is true. I mean 
when you weigh the benefits to the cost whether it’s the, you know, 
climate  change  effect  or  reducing  gasoline  consumption  or  carbon 
dioxide  emissions  collectively  truly  do  provide  tremendous  benefits 
and outweigh the cost. And I appreciate that because the schedule 
for issuing the deadlines has to be by April 1. 

Mr. LAHOOD. That’s correct. 
Senator SNOWE. As you well know and I just hope that that will 
be  the  case.  Frankly  continuing  to  defer  doesn’t  help  the  industry. 
They  need  to  have  certainty  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  we  have 
to be on the cutting edge of change and be prepared for the future 
given the state of energy today. 

And putting themselves at risk, as we found when the consumers 
were not in a position to be able to purchase vehicles that were fuel 
efficient. And they weren’t prepared to sell them. So it’s in our na-
tional interest, frankly, the final analysis. 

And  I  think  that  these  statistics  certainly  underscore  the  value 
of the CAFE standards and how we must meet to achieve them and 
meet the deadline that’s created in the law. 

Mr. LAHOOD. Senator Snowe, I’m going to do everything I can to 

try and meet the deadline. 

Senator SNOWE. I appreciate that very much. Incidentally on Es-
sential Air Service again, it’s a critical issue as I mentioned earlier. 
And I hope that you would take a look at this legislation that Sen-
ator  Bingaman  and  I  have  introduced  particularly  providing  some 
flexibility  in  the  contracts  between  the  Essential  Air  Service  com-

munities,  the  small  communities  and  the  airlines  to  extend  those 
contracts from two to four years. 

Again I think it’s much more cost efficient. It certainly is for the 
communities that have certainty and stability and to be able to ne-
gotiate  cost-efficient  contracts.  And  it’s  certainly  something  that  is 
truly  necessary  if  we’re  going  to  do  anything  to  rebuild  rural  com-
munities across this country. 

And  frankly  they’ve  been  shortchanged  in  the  promises  of  de-
regulation  in  1978.  They  were  supposed  to  be  part  of  a  national 
plan,  a  national  infrastructure  system  and  they  truly  have  been 
left behind. So I hope that you will evaluate that as well. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Senator  Snowe,  I  know  that  Chairman  Rockefeller 
is keenly interested in this. Again, during 14 years I served in the 
House, so many of my district’s small communities were lacking in 
air  service,  and  we  worked  very  hard  to  get  Essential  Air  Service 
in these communities. 

It’s  important.  It  can  be  an  economic  engine  for  these  commu-
nities  and  it’s  an  opportunity,  really  for  people  in  these  commu-
nities  to  have  service.  I  will  work  very  hard  with  you  and  others 
who want to make this happen. 

Senator SNOWE. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Thank 

you, Mr. Chairman. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Snowe.  Before  I  make—just 
make  a  suggestion.  I’d  just  like  to  say  that  I  think  our  posture  as 
a  committee  should  not  be  to  figure  out,  ‘‘gee  we’re  not  going  to 
have the money to pay for this.’’ 

I  think  our,  you  know,  because  of  whatever  size  the  stimulus 
package  or  our  national  debt  is  going  to  be,  I  think  our  posture 
ought  to  be  that  we  need  to  do  everything  that  we  need  to  do  to 
fulfill  the  mandate  of  this  committee  and  protect  the  safety  and 
prosperity  of  the  American  people.  And  that’s  the  way  I  intend  to 
look at it so that it will land squarely on your shoulders should you 
be confirmed, all the hard decisions. 

Now having said that—— 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Having  said  that  and  before  calling  on  Senator 
Warner  and  Senator  Begich,  it  is  the  desire  of  the  majority  party 
to  try  and  get  all  nominees  approved  this  afternoon,  if  possible. 
And  there  is  a  way  that  we  can  do  that  and  meet  the  four  o’clock 
deadline. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  And  that  is  by  asking,  in  that  I  sense  nothing 
but  approval  and  willingness  to  work  with  you  from  our  point  of 
view and from your point of view exactly the same view toward us. 
I  would  suggest—I  would  ask  if  the  members  of  the  Committee, 
voting  members  of  the  Committee,  would  give  Kay  Bailey 
Hutchison  and  I  the  right  to  simply  inform  the  floor  that  if  they 
want  to  run  a  UC  on  you  at  1  minute  of  four  and  get  you  nomi-
nated  by  four  o’clock,  the  Committee  will  not  be  unhappy.  The 
Chairman will be happy. 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  just  say  that  I  agree 

with that. I think 4:30 was the deadline. 

The CHAIRMAN. 4:30? 
[Laughter.]

Senator HUTCHISON. So we’ll—— 
The CHAIRMAN. A little pressure—— 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  You  know,  the  realistic  responsible  Repub-

lican here. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  HUTCHISON.  But  seriously,  I  think  this  is  a  very  good 
idea  of  yours.  I  appreciate  your  leadership.  Because  I  think  it  is 
fair  for  all  of  us  and  right  for  all  of  us  that  Mr.  LaHood  become 
the  Secretary  and  go  over  there  and  start  doing  so  many  of  the 
things that we have just asked him to address. And so I would ap-
prove of that. 

We will also notify our side that it’s going to happen. And if they 
want  to  object  they  will  have  the  right  to  object.  But  I  don’t  see 
anyone doing that. 

I  think  that  you  have  done  a  very  good  job.  And  I  look  forward 
to working with you. And I hope we can do that this afternoon, by 
4:30. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  that  means  that  a  unanimous  consent 
agreement  will  be  run  through  the  telephones  on  each  side  and  if 
anybody objects then that ends that. And then we hope that nobody 
objects.  And  then  that  will  end  that.  And  we’ll  have  a  new  Sec-
retary of Transportation. 

So  that  will  proceed.  And  then  in  order  of  membership  on  the 
Committee  I  need  to  call  on  Senator  McCaskill.  And  just  so  that 
Senator  Warner  and  Senator  Begich  don’t  feel  mistreated,  it’s  just 
a problem of one day. 

So  Senator  McCaskill,  you  have  what  you  have  to  say  and  ask 

and then Senator Warner, then Senator Begich. 

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  will  be  very  brief,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank 
you.  I  know  there  was  some  discussion  earlier,  Representative 
LaHood,  about  earmarks.  I  tried  to  research  earmarks  in  the 
Transportation  budget.  And  found  out  that  one  of  the  reasons  it 
has flourished is because it’s so darn complicated. 

Most members probably don’t even understand the difference be-
tween  an  ‘‘above  the  line’’  and  a  ‘‘below  the  line.’’  Many  of  them 
don’t understand that—in fact when I talked to CRS about it trying 
to  figure  it  out  they  told  me  to  find  an  easier  issue  to  work  on. 
Clearly  it  is  not  a  matter  of  bringing  extra  money  into  a  state. 
Clearly there is some ‘‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’’ that goes on with 
the earmarking process. 

My state has an extensive planning process both through metro-
politan  planning  organizations  and  through  our  state  highway  de-
partment.  Lots  of  input,  a  regional  approach,  cost-benefit  analysis 
and  their  STIP  program  is  well  thought  out  and  with  all  the  kind 
of  input  that  you  would  ever  want  for  a  public  infrastructure 
project. When we are earmarking around here, many times we are 
just  putting  projects  upon  these  state  agencies  that  they,  frankly, 
don’t  even  want  to  do  because  they  have  other  projects  that  have 
in fact had this kind of public transparency analysis. 

And  in  Fiscal  Year  2008,  for  example  $340  million  of  the  $600 
million that was going to be extra money that could have gone into 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

55 

core  funding  programs  was  skimmed  off  for  earmarking.  And  one 
of  the  things  that’s  most  frustrating  is  even  what  you  have  above 
the  line  that  may  be  extra  money,  that  money  doesn’t  go  to  the 
most  valuable  projects  in  terms  of  needs  in  our  country.  It  goes  to 
who’s  most  senior.  It  goes  to  the  member  that  is  most  politically 
vulnerable.  It  goes  to  people  that  serve  on  certain  committees.  It 
doesn’t  go  based  on  some  kind  of  analysis  as  to  what  is  the  best 
use of that money in a macro sense. 

I  would  like  your  answer  today  about  what  I  just  said  and  how 
you  view  your  job  as  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  to  have  a 
more transparent and open process including local planning for the 
way we fund infrastructure in this country. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Well  thank  you,  Senator.  You  know  this  because 
you,  like  all  of  us,  have  followed  the  campaign  and  followed  the 
rhetoric. President Obama has made it very clear that, in the Stim-
ulus bill, the lion’s share, which will come through the Department 
of Transportation, will not be earmarked money. 

We’re  going  to  do  everything  we  possibly  can  to  make  sure  his 
mandate  and  his  direction  is  carried  out  in  our  part  of  the  stim-
ulus.  So  we’re  going  to  work  with  the  Governors.  And  we’re  going 
to  tell  the  Governors  that  this  money  can  come  to  your  state,  but 
it  has  to  be  for  projects  that  have  been  planned,  organized,  and 
have met all of the requirements, because we want people working 
this summer, building roads, building bridges and doing infrastruc-
ture work. 

We’re  going  to  hold  Governors  accountable.  And  we’re  going  to 
make  sure  that  there  are  no  earmarked  dollars.  That’s  the  man-
date that I believe we have from President Obama on this. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Well—— 
Mr. LAHOOD. Now when it comes to reauthorization, we’re going 
to  have  to  work  with  all  of  you.  I  was  on  the  Transportation  and 
Infrastructure  Committee  for  6  years.  I’m  not  going  to  describe  in 
detail all the stories that went on over there about when a bill like 
ISTEA was marked up. 

The  point  is,  it’s  up  to  the  members  to  decide  there  aren’t  going 
to  be  earmarks.  And  it’s  up  to  the  members  to  decide  that  this 
money  is  going  to  be  spent  in  a  certain  way.  And  we’ll  help  you 
with  that.  But  when  we  get  a  mandate  from  the  Congress  that  x 
amount  of  dollars  has  to  be  spent  on  x  amount  of  project—or  this 
project in a certain area, that’s the law. 

President  Obama  wants  to  eliminate  earmarks,  particularly  in 
the  stimulus.  I  think  that  idea  will  carry  over  to  the  reauthoriza-
tion of the surface transportation bill. And I—— 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  know  that  President  Obama  wants  to 
eliminate  earmarks.  I  want  to  make  sure  the  Secretary  of  Trans-
portation also wants to eliminate earmarks. 

Mr. LAHOOD. Let me just repeat what I said, Senator. I work for 
President  Obama.  I  work  for  the  American  people.  And  I’m  going 
to  work  in  collaboration  with  the  Congress.  Nobody  has  more  of  a 
healthy respect for Congress than Ray LaHood. 

I  was  a  member  for  14  years.  I  served  as  a  staffer  for  17  years. 
I  have  over  30  years  working  for  Congress  and  I  have  a  healthy 
regard for what all of you do. I know how it works. It’s hard work.

56 

I’m  going  to  work  with  you.  And  I’m  going  to  work  with  the 
Chairman.  I’m  going  to  work  with  the  Committee  to  fashion  a  bill 
that  makes  sense  for  America,  that  funds  the  infrastructure  needs 
of America. And if it doesn’t have one earmark, that’s not going to 
cause me any heartburn. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Good.  Good.  I  think  you’re  a  terrific  choice. 
I  think  it’s  great  that  President  Obama  selected  you  because  I 
spent  a  lot  of  time  telling  America  that  we  were  going  to  have  a 
bipartisan Cabinet. And I’m glad we do. 

And  I  hope  that  you  will  forgive  me  that  my  first  question  felt 
confrontational,  but  it’s  something  I  feel  very  strongly  about.  And 
I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  the  Administration  in  the 
weeks  to  come  on  eliminating  this.  Let  the  strongest  be  the  most 
powerful when it comes to spending public money. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Well,  thank  you,  Senator.  I  certainly  wasn’t  of-
fended  by  it  at  all.  And  I  meant  what  I  said.  I  have  the  highest 
regard  for  the  Congress  and  what  you  all  do,  and  I  always  will. 
You’ll always be a priority, always. 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Thank you. 
Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. Senator Warner? 
Senator  WARNER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  go  back 
to  the  three  points  that  I’d  raised  earlier,  Representative  LaHood. 
And first of all let me acknowledge this first question is more—you 
haven’t gotten there yet, you’ve got your arms around a very, very 
large department—but again, my prior experience as Governor and 
working  somewhat  over  the  last  couple  years  on  this  issue,  the 
complexity of the 11 agencies that fall within DOT. That structure 
seems to be pretty much set up in a 20th century structure. 

And as we move particularly toward this, in what I hope will be 
one of the directions of more looking at a project on a multi-modal 
basis, the funding streams and the revenue streams that come out 
of  these  specific  agencies  don’t  always  intertwine.  As  you  look  in 
your term as Secretary will you look at the structure of the Depart-
ment  in  terms  of  how  we  can  advance  these  more  21st  century 
goals like multi-modal? 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Absolutely,  Senator.  I  think  what  you’re  going  to 
find  is  that  I’m  going  to  be  a  very  hands  on.  And  the  Department 
will know I’m going to be very hands on. 

I’m going to get all these modal Administrators together and I’m 
going to explain to them very clearly that we have a mandate from 
President Obama to get things done. We want less bureaucracy and 
less red tape, and we want to put people to work. We want to make 
sure  that  we  carry  out  the  mandates  of  Congress  on  Amtrak  and 
on FAA. 

I’m  going  to  pull  people  together  and  I’m  going  to  make  them 
work  hard.  And  we  are  going  to  work  hard.  And  if  it  means  elimi-
nating  something  here  or  there,  or  combining  a  few  things  it’ll  be 
done. 

Senator  WARNER.  Thank  you.  The  second  part  kind  of  goes  from 
the  structure  to  the  metrics  and  again  I  think  Senator  McCaskill, 
Senator  Wicker  was  raising  issues  about  accountability.  I  do  think 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

57 

there’s oftentimes a lack of knowledge at a lot of policymaker’s lev-
els on what the metrics of evaluation are going to be. 

Again  I  think  back  about  the  old  VMT  standards  and  others. 
You’ve  talked  about  a  livability  standard.  There’s  conversations 
about  a  mobility  standard.  My  hope,  and  this  would  have  to  be 
done fairly quickly, but as you look at some of the projects that are 
going to come out of the President’s Reinvestment Act, I would love 
that  some  of  those  projects  on  almost  a  beta  test  model  might  be 
evaluated  on  some  of  these  new  metrics.  So  that  as  you  get  to  the 
Reauthorization  bill  later  in  the  year,  you  had  some  new  metrics 
out  there  that  are  going  to  take  into  accountability.  They’re  going 
to  take  into  account,  livability,  mobility,  these,  I  think  again,  are 
more  21st  century  ways  we’re  going  to  measure  our  infrastructure 
investment. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  You  have  my  commitment  to  do  that,  Senator.  I 
think it’s very important. We need to really move into the 21st cen-
tury  on  some  of  these  things.  And  I  think  the  Reauthorization  bill 
is going to allow us to do some of these—— 

Senator  WARNER.—Looks  at  a  whole  new  way  of  looking  at 

projects—— 

Mr. LAHOOD. Absolutely. Absolutely. 
Senator WARNER. I mean that we’ve got more agreement. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Get more value. 
Senator WARNER.—Policymakers in terms of value. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Yes. 
Senator  WARNER.  And  you’ve  raised  the  issue.  And  I  appreciate 
your  comments  and  Senator  Hutchison’s  comments  about  the  toll-
ing. I do think public/private is going to have to be a piece of this. 
And  I  would  add  Senator  Klobuchar’s  idea  of  laying  dark  fiber 
while  you’re  putting  in  the  roads  is  something  we’ve  tried  in  Vir-
ginia with some mixed success. But it makes an enormous amount 
of sense. And is one of those areas of public/private. 

But my hope, as a state that’s been kind of out there on the lead-
ing  edge  of  public/private  partnerships  in  transportation  for  more 
than  a  decade,  that  as  we  look  at  these  initiatives  on  the  public/ 
private side, that we make sure that the private party has actually 
got capital at risk and stays in the game. And there have been too 
often  proposals  that  came  by  my  desk  as  Governor  that  had  a  pri-
vate partner looking good at the first blush, but taking none of the 
risk and getting all the rewards in the back end. 

Mr. LAHOOD. Certainly. 
Senator WARNER. As we look at public/private which often times 
involves  tolling,  making  sure  that  they’ve  got  to  stay  in  the  game 
is very important. 

Mr. LAHOOD. I’d like to use your expertise on that and see if we 
can  make  it  happen.  And  since  you  are  a  part  of  this  committee, 
I think it will be a priority. 

Senator WARNER. Thank you, sir. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. Senator Begich?

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK BEGICH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator  BEGICH.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have 
one, kind of parochial for Alaska and then I just have some general 
ones  I  added  as  a  couple  more  questions.  But  you  know  the  big 
project for Alaska and for this country, I believe and actually Presi-
dent  Obama  has  put  it  on  his  top  five  list,  of  the  green  job  cre-
ations  in  the  future  is  the  Alaska  Natural  Gas  Pipeline  which  will 
be thousands of jobs, a lot of investment, but will benefit this coun-
try greatly. 

With that project there’s about $2 billion worth of road projects— 
infrastructure  that’s  necessary  to  construct  that  project  and  get 
material  to  the  sites.  Is  that  something  that  you’d  be  willing  to 
work  with  the  Alaska  delegation  to  figure  out  how  to  solve  that 
first  piece  so  that  we  can  then  move  to  this  larger  $40  billion 
project? 

Roads  and  bridges  are  part  of  the  equation.  We  can’t  get  the 
project  moving  without  those  reconstructions  or  new  constructions 
to  move  the  equipment,  move  the  construction  material.  Is  that 
something  that  you’d  be  willing  to  work  with  us  on  to  get  this 
mega-project forward? 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Yes,  sir.  I  don’t  know  if  you  are  in  a  position  now 
to say that it’s ready to go and could be a part of the stimulus, but 
if it is—— 

Senator BEGICH.—Bid-ready. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Well. 
Senator BEGICH. Then we’ll talk. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Absolutely. 
Senator  BEGICH.  OK.  I’ll  leave  it  at  that.  I’ll  take  it  because 

you’re half way there so I don’t want to blow it, so I’ll take it. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. LAHOOD. I guarantee you won’t blow it, Senator. 
Senator BEGICH. OK, good. Well they are bid-ready. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Yes, good. 
Senator  BEGICH.  Good  jobs.  The  other  one,  just  to  put  it  on  the 
record  for  you.  I’m  probably  not  one  of  those  big  fans  for  tolling, 
but  we  can  have  that  discussion.  I  think  it  hurts  the  working  peo-
ple the most when they go on toll roads. 

But  I  know  that  we  have  to  be  innovative  in  the  future  in  how 
we  deal  with  roads.  And  I  would  like,  maybe  in  the  Reauthoriza-
tion—you  know  as  we  look  at  this  Economic  Recovery  bill  one  of 
the  big  problems  is  going  to  be  and  I  noted  when  you  mentioned 
Governors,  as  a  former  mayor  we  love  the  state,  but  we  love  local 
governments. Because we can deliver projects faster, more efficient 
and  we  know  exactly  what  project  is  going  to  be  done  as  quickly 
as possible. 

My  biggest  concern  with  the  Economic  Recovery  bill  is  just  that. 
It’s  going  so  much  to  the  state  bureaucracy  that  the  amount  that 
they  take  on  the  DOT  on  the  state  level  will  knock  15,  20  maybe 
as  much  as  30  percent  out  of  project  for  just  adding  an  overhead. 
And  then  it  will  trickle  down  to  local  governments  who  then  have 
to  deliver  these  projects.  So  I  have  some  great  concerns  over  that 
in  the  sense  of  how  the  Economic  Recovery  bill  is  moving  forward.

But in the longer term when the reauthorization of the Highway 
bill  comes  up,  I  honestly  think  the  system  is  broken  in  the  sense 
of  deliverability  of  these  projects.  I’ll  just  give  you  one.  In  Alaska 
it  was  a  pretty  significant  project  because  we  did  it  with  our 
money, went through wetlands, did a lot of things that met all the 
environmental  requirements.  The  environmental  community  was 
very satisfied with the end project. We shaved off a year and a half 
of  that  project,  saved  $2  million  because  of  the  difference  in  the 
regulatory process. 

And  I  would  like  to  work  with  you  and  whoever  to  try  to  figure 
out  how  we  solve  this  problem.  Because  if  you  talk  to  any  mayor 
and  I  talked  to  200  of  them  on  Monday  across  this  country,  this 
is  a  significant  problem  in  how  to  deliver  money  in  regard  to  the 
highway  funds.  As  we  reform  it,  we  have  to  reform  the  ability  to 
deliver  these  projects  in  a  timely  manner.  And  the  Federal  system 
just doesn’t do it. 

And  that’s  just  from  6  years  of  a  mayor  and  meeting  with  200 
mayors  this  week.  It’s  a  big  message.  And  I  hope  you  will  look  to-
ward  mayors  also  for  your  advice  and  get  some  good  ideas  about 
how to deliver those projects. 

Mr.  LAHOOD.  Can  I  just  say  something  about  local  government? 
Senator BEGICH. Sure. 
Mr.  LAHOOD.  You  may  know  this,  but  in  Los  Angeles  County 
they  just  passed  a  referendum.  The  voters  passed  a  referendum  to 
provide  an  enormous  amount  of  money  for  infrastructure  in  Los 
Angeles  County.  Now  to  me  that’s  thinking  outside  the  box.  Obvi-
ously,  the  local  government  leaders  have  a  lot  of  credibility  with 
local  tax-payers,  and  they’re  willing  to  raise  their  taxes  because  of 
the very point that you’re making. The money never gets there be-
cause  places  like  California  and  every  state  has  huge  financial 
problems. 

So  the  point  is  that—I  know  the  Mayors  and  local  elected  offi-
cials. We’ve heard from them and we know they’re not happy. But, 
as you know, President Obama wants to get this money out. There 
is  a  mechanism  to  do  that.  It  goes  back  to  what  Senator  Warner 
said we have to get the bureaucracy at DOT to make sure that peo-
ple  are  held  accountable,  that  the  money  is  spent  properly  and  it 
can  get  out  the  door  and  the  people  can  be  working  this  summer. 

And I know what you’re saying though, Senator. 
Senator  BEGICH.—Watching  the  clock  tick  here.  But  we’re  doing 
the  largest  in  Anchorage,  Alaska,  the  largest  light  conversion 
project  for  street  lights  in  the  country.  It  will  save  us  about  $1.6 
million, a year in energy cost. The investment will be paid back in 
5 to 7 years. And would you be willing to look at a national stand-
ard because the DOT’s don’t do that. And there’s a huge consump-
tion of energy with street lights throughout this country with Fed-
eral highway systems. 

Would you be willing to look at a national standard that we can 
consider  implementing  to  create  energy  efficient  lights  on  all  the 
highway systems? 

Mr. LAHOOD. Yes, sir. 
Senator BEGICH. Great. That’s all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator  Begich.  I’m  going  to  close 
this now for two reasons. One, a vote started. The vote incidentally

is  on  the  nomination  of  Senator  Clinton  who  evidently  isn’t  going 
to get the same treatment that you are.

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  I  want  to  say  in  my  first  opportunity  to 
chair  at  the  Commerce  Committee  hearing,  I  could  not  be  more 
proud to have done so with you as the witness. You have an ability 
to  answer  questions  in  such  a  straight  ahead  way.  You’ve  been 
through  it  already.  You  understand  in  a  cooperative  way  because 
of  the  30  years  of  experience  with  the  legislature.  And  I  expect 
probably because of your own good DNA and good humor and a lot 
of experience. I’m tremendously pleased about you having been our 
first nominee. 

Mr. LAHOOD. So am I, Senator. Thank you for the courtesies. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  OK.  And  with  good  luck  you’re  already  in  there.

Mr. LAHOOD. I like those words too, Mr. Chairman.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question 1a. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: 
A  Legacy  for  Users  Act  of  2005  (SAFETEA–LU)  will  expire  in  September  2009.  I 
believe  that  it  is  time  to  rethink  the  purpose  of  our  transportation  programs  and 
the  proper  Federal  role  in  administering  and  managing  the  programs  moving  for-
ward.  This  is  going  to  be  a  major  task  that  will  require  a  strong  leader,  innovative 
thinking,  and  close  coordination  with  Congress.  What  are  your  thoughts  on  devel-
oping  a  multimodal  national  transportation  policy?  Are  you  prepared  for  this  large 
task?  Should  you  be  confirmed,  when  can  we  expect  a  surface  transportation  reau-
thorization proposal to be submitted by the Department to the Congress? 

Answer.  As  we  approach  reauthorization  of  the  surface  transportation  programs 
in  the  ‘‘Safe,  Accountable,  Flexible,  Efficient  Transportation  Equity  Act:  A  Legacy 
for  Users,’’  we  need  to  ‘‘think  outside  the  box,’’  particularly  as  to  future  funding 
mechanisms. I agree that new emphasis on a multimodal transportation policy per-
spective  is  essential  to  renewing  these  programs  and,  if  confirmed,  would  hope  to 
bring  strong  leadership,  innovative  thinking,  and  close  coordination  with  Congress 
to  this  undertaking.  As  I  stated  to  Ranking  Member  Hutchison  at  the  nomination 
hearing, I hope to develop a reauthorization proposal this year. 

Question  1b.  Today’s  Federal  transportation  programs  lack  overarching  goals  or 
priorities and transportation funding is generally distributed to states regardless of 
transportation  outcomes.  Do  you  support  moving  to  a  more  accountable,  perform-
ance-based transportation system that emphasizes getting more out of our transpor-
tation investments? If so, what standards of performance would you support using? 
Similarly,  other  countries  (e.g.,  Britain,  Canada)  make  choices  between  different 
types of transportation investments based on the projects’ estimated cost-benefit ra-
tios, which include a wide spectrum of economic, social and environmental costs and 
benefits. Should we be doing something similar in the U.S.? 

Answer. A key challenge for those who craft the Nation’s transportation programs 
will be to link decision-making to performance at all levels. This will require a new 
commitment  to  measure  performance,  as  called  for  by  the  National  Surface  Trans-
portation  Policy  and  Revenue  Commission’s  recent  report.  Performance  measure-
ment is key to ensuring that new funding is invested wisely and that the public has 
enough confidence in our work to support continued investment. 

Question  1c.  The  Federal  Government  currently  spends  more  than  80  percent  of 
surface transportation dollars on roads and related infrastructure, with the balance 
going  to  public  transportation,  intercity  rail,  bike,  and  pedestrian  infrastructure. 
Given the Obama Administration’s concerns regarding energy supply and the rising 
demand  for  alternatives  to  driving,  do  you  support  reconsidering  this  distribution? 
Answer.  I  am  committed  to  supporting  sound  investment  in  our  transportation 
systems  to  maximize  our  resources,  increase  energy  efficiency,  and  provide  greater 
accessibility,  including  innovative  approaches  to  achieve  our  goals.  The  balance  of 
funding among the surface transportation modes will be fundamental to the best in-
vestment of our Federal transportation resources, going forward. 

Question 2. What role do you see the Department playing in developing mitigation 
and  adaptation  strategies  for  the  Nation’s  transportation  infrastructure  to  respond 
to climate change? How will the DOT work with other Federal agencies? 

Answer. We must acknowledge the new reality of climate change. This has impli-
cations  in  all  areas.  Sustainability  must  permeate  all  we  do,  from  highways  and 
transit  to  aviation  and  ports.  President  Obama  is  committed  to  this  principle,  and 
so am I. Making climate change a top priority as well as dealing with other environ-
mental concerns will require a new level of attention to our transportation systems, 
as well as a new mindset for the Department. Increased energy efficiency in our ve-
hicles and our passenger and freight transportation systems will significantly allevi-
ate  the  problem  of  greenhouse  gases.  When  I  was  in  the  House,  I  voted  numerous

times to raise the CAFE standards. I think this is an important way for us to reduce 
emissions and I will do everything I can to meet the deadlines. 

Among  the  key  challenges  for  effective  mitigation  strategies  is  the  development 
of  close  working  relationships  with  other  agencies  whose  goals  and  programs  inter-
act  with  those  of  the  Department  of  Transportation—and  this  is  something  I  will 
move quickly to accomplish if confirmed. 

Question 3a. Will you be a strong advocate for small community air service? 
Answer.  I  served  for  14  years  in  the  House  of  Representatives  and  represented 
many communities that were lacking air service. I understand the importance of air 
service to small communities. 

Question 3b. Do you believe any changes need to be made to the current Essential 

Air Service (EAS) program? 

Question  3c.  What  can  be  done  to  make  certain  sufficient  funding  is  provided  to 

EAS communities? 

Question 3d. What steps will you take to make certain small and isolated commu-

nities across the Nation have access to affordable air service? 

Answer. I believe that air service for small communities can help serve as an eco-
nomic  engine.  Although  the  new  Administration’s  policy  on  specifics  of  this  nature 
is not yet established, if confirmed, I am committed to working with this Committee 
to  ensure  that  small  communities  remain  connected  to  the  national  air  transpor-
tation system. 

Question  4.  The  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  provides  the  Federal  Aviation 
Administration (FAA) with weather forecasting services to make sure that air traffic 
across  the  Nation  receives  adequate  support.  I  understand  that  the  FAA  has  re-
quested the NWS provide a proposal to consolidate its Center Weather Service Units 
from 21 to two. I am concerned that the potential consolidation initiative might not 
result  in  the  best  model  to  meet  aviation  forecasting  needs.  Do  you  think  it  would 
be appropriate for the NWS and the FAA to request a study on aviation forecasting 
needs and options for improving services prior to moving forward? 

Answer.  Before  offering  an  opinion  on  this  matter,  I  would  need  to  consult  with 
the  experts  at  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration.  That  said,  I  understand  the 
criticality of having weather forecasting services in place to support aviation needs. 
Question  5.  Current  Federal  law  generally  prohibits  the  use  of  surface  transpor-
tation funds within a port area. With aging port infrastructure and projected water-
borne  transportation  growth  over  the  next  twenty  years,  do  you  believe  a  larger 
Federal role in the planning and development of port infrastructure is appropriate? 
Answer. The Department of Transportation is already leading port modernization 
and expansion projects in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam. Some of the funding for these 
projects is through existing highway and transit mechanisms, but it is very limited. 
Other opportunities exist under the short sea transportation section of the 2007 En-
ergy  Independence  and  Security  Act,  which  mandated  a  new  Marine  Highway  Pro-
gram. The program’s objective is to shift freight and passengers from our congested 
highways and railroads to water every place it is practicable. 

Question  6a.  Annual  large  truck  crash  deaths  remain  shockingly  high,  totaling 
around 5,000. What can the Congress do to make the most immediate improvements 
in truck safety? 

Answer. I am concerned about truck crash deaths. As I said in my opening state-
ment, my first goal is safety on the roads, on the rails, in the air, and on the water. 
The  Federal  Government  clearly  plays  an  important  role  in  preventing  truck  crash 
deaths. I believe the upcoming reauthorization of the surface transportation bill will 
provide an opportunity to ensure the Department has the authority it needs to con-
duct  effective  oversight  of  the  motor  carrier  industry  and  the  resources  it  needs  to 
continue  its  successful  partnerships  with  State  law  enforcement  and  motor  vehicle 
administrators to implement commercial motor vehicle safety programs. 

Question  6b.  What  do  you  believe  is  the  best  way  for  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier 
Safety  Administration  to  improve  its  oversight  and  enforcement  over  the  trucking 
industry? 

Answer.  I  believe  the  best  way  for  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administra-
tion  (FMCSA)  to  improve  its  oversight  and  enforcement  of  the  trucking  industry  is 
to  maintain  and  strengthen  a  rigorous  enforcement  program  in  conjunction  with 
State  partners.  This  includes  targeting  high  risk  carriers  for  compliance  reviews, 
maintaining  a  strong  roadside  inspection  program,  working  with  States  to  ensure 
unsafe  carriers  receive  vehicle  registration  sanctions,  and  targeting  unsafe  carriers 
through  a  more  comprehensive  safety  measurement  system  and  a  performance- 
based safety fitness standard.

Question  6c.  Where  do  you  see  the  role  of  new  technology,  such  as  electronic  on 

board recorders, in improving motor carrier safety? 

Answer.  I  see  a  role  for  current  and  emerging  technology  in  improving  safety  on 
our  highways.  Safety  is  the  top  priority  at  the  Department  of  Transportation.  Per-
haps  the  most  important  influence  on  improving  heavy  truck  and  bus  safety  in  the 
future  rests  with  integrating  smart  technologies  like  on-board  safety  devices  to  im-
prove driver performance. This is an area I want to thoroughly explore. 

Question  7.  The  DOT  and  its  authority  to  regulate  fuel  economy  is  specifically 
crafted for the agency to maximize fuel economy while taking other very significant 
factors into account, including the safety of the passenger fleet and the financial sta-
bility  of  the  automobile  industry.  This  authority  and  expertise  is  vital  in  achieving 
our goals to decrease the greenhouse gas footprint of the transportation sector. How 
do  you  plan  to  use  the  DOT’s  leadership  and  authority  in  the  CAFE  program  in 
working  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and  its  authority  to  regulate 
greenhouse  gas  emissions?  What  synergies  do  you  see  being  developed  between  the 
agencies to improve your authority and the CAFE program? 

Answer. I believe a management emphasis of the new Administration is to stress 
inter-agency  coordination,  such  as  should  be  the  case  with  Clean  Air  Act  and  auto-
motive  fuel-economy  regulations,  to  a  greater  extent  than  has  been  the  case  in  the 
past. President Obama is committed to ensuring that the Administration’s transpor-
tation  policy  furthers  his  goal  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  promote  liv-
able  communities,  and  so  am  I.  If  confirmed,  I  would  expect  to  work  closely  with 
the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  to  ensure  that  fuel  economy  is  improved  and 
carbon dioxide emissions are reduced in a responsible, consistent, and effective man-
ner. 

Question 8a. Do you support the Jones Act? 
Answer.  I  support  the  Jones  Act.  Reserving  domestic  waterborne  transportation 
to U.S.-flag, U.S.-built, and U.S.-citizen owned and U.S.-crewed vessels ensures the 
availability of U.S.-flag vessels in an emergency. The Jones Act fleet is an important 
link  in  the  national  transportation  infrastructure,  and  its  ships  can  carry  an  unin-
terrupted  flow  of  vital  commodities  necessary  to  our  troops  while  avoiding  disrup-
tions to our economy and industrial base. 

Question  8b.  What  steps  do  you  believe  the  Department  could  take  to  assist  in 
educating  other  Federal  agencies  about  the  importance  of  the  Jones  Act  to  our  na-
tional security and to ensure the enforcement of the law? 

Answer. Congress amended the law in 2008 to require that the Maritime Admin-
istration (MARAD) be consulted about the availability of U.S.-flag vessels before any 
national  security  waiver  of  the  law  is  granted.  This  new  consultation  role  for 
MARAD  will  enable  the  agency  to  work  more  closely  with  other  Federal  agencies 
to ensure the law is enforced. By working more closely with MARAD, other Federal 
agencies  will  become  better  acquainted  with  the  importance  of  the  Jones  Act  fleet 
to our defense and economy. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL INOUYE TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question  1a.  Several  safety  concerns  have  been  raised  regarding  Hawaii’s  air 
transportation system. One issue is the aging infrastructure used for air traffic con-
trol.  Both  the  facilities  within  which  the  air  traffic  controllers  work  and  much  of 
the  equipment  they  depend  on,  such  as  radars,  are  decades  old  and  are  in  need  of 
replacement.  Concerns  have  also  been  raised  specifically  about  the  airspace  around 
Kona.  Air  traffic  controllers  have  identified  several  incidents  where  operational  er-
rors  have  led  to  the  near  misses  of  aircraft,  raising  questions  about  how  well  the 
airspace  is  being  managed.  Finally,  there  have  been  several  accidents  involving  air 
tour  helicopters.  The  National  Transportation  Safety  Board’s  (NTSB)  investigations 
of  these  helicopter  accidents  have  led  to  several  recommendations,  including  better 
oversight  of  air  tour  operators  and  the  installations  of  Automatic  Dependent  Sur-
veillance-Broadcast (ADS–B) throughout the islands. National trends in runway in-
cursions and operational errors suggest the FAA must take immediate action to re-
duce the possibility of a catastrophic accident. What steps do you believe the Admin-
istration should take in the next year to bring down the number of near-misses that 
the system is experiencing? 

Answer.  I  can  assure  you  that  transportation  safety  will  remain  the  top  priority 
for the Department if I am confirmed, and DOT will be focused on improving safety 
across the board. Before offering specific plans to improve aviation safety, I will con-

64 

sult  with  the  experts  at  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  and  get  the  benefit 
of the perspective of a new FAA Administrator. 

Question 1b. Although FAA has taken important steps to modernize the air traffic 
control  system,  there  is  no  clear  schedule  for  the  implementation  of  NextGen,  nor 
a  good  idea  of  when  the  system  will  start  to  see  the  benefits  of  key  technologies, 
such as ADS–B. Given Hawaii’s unique terrain and unpredictable weather patterns, 
air traffic control (ATC) modernization would be particularly beneficial for our state. 
Answer.  NextGen  will  be  a  priority  for  the  Department.  The  Department  should 
be  committed  to  NextGen  implementation  within  realistic  benchmarks,  working 
closely with Congress and all the stakeholders to develop milestones for the delivery 
of key technologies. 

Question 1c. How soon do you expect that the FAA will be able to fully implement 
NextGen across the nation, and in Hawaii? What resources do you need to expedite 
the implementation of NextGen? 

Answer. NextGen is a priority for the Nation. I can assure you that, if confirmed, 
I  will  be  personally  focused  on  implementation—working  closely  with  the  FAA  to 
expeditiously  develop  timelines  for  full  implementation  and  to  determine  the  re-
sources it needs to be successful. 

Question  2a.  In  the  past  year  there  have  been  a  few  incidents  where  commercial 
aircraft have made emergency landings because pilots suspected smoke in the cock-
pit.  This  has  raised  concerns  about  the  adequacy  of  current  safety  measures  in  the 
event an aircraft’s cockpit completely filled with smoke, obscuring the pilots’ vision, 
and  inhibiting  their  ability  to  fly  the  plane.  What  safety  measures  are  currently  in 
place to prevent an aircraft’s cockpit from filling with smoke? 

Answer.  I  am  told  there  are  numerous  systems  and  procedures  in  place  to  both 
prevent,  and  mitigate  the  effects  of,  smoke  in  the  cockpit.  Airplane  design  require-
ments  enable  the  flight  crew  to  use  the  ventilation  system  to  evacuate  smoke  from 
the cockpit. The crew can also change the source of ventilation if the smoke is origi-
nating from outside the flight deck. 

Question 2b. Are there safety measures in place to help ensure pilots can continue 

to operate the aircraft if the cockpit fills with smoke? 

Answer. I am told that all cockpits have emergency equipment that includes oxy-
gen  masks  for  breathing,  smoke  goggles  that  allow  pilots  to  see  the  instruments, 
and fire extinguishers Also, each crew has a specific checklist in case of smoke, fire, 
or fumes designed to maintain control of the aircraft while isolating and mitigating 
the source of the malfunction. 

Question  3a.  Many  reports  show  that  within  the  next  20–30  years,  the  United 
States can expect huge increases in population, congestion, and global trade. Freight 
flows  are  expected  to  double  within  this  same  timeframe.  Despite  this,  the  Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  has  failed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  national  strategy  or 
policy  for  freight  movement  to  prepare  the  transportation  system  to  guide  invest-
ments to meet these future demands. Nor has the Department proposed possible fi-
nancing  mechanism  for  needed  freight  infrastructure  improvements.  The  Surface 
Transportation  Policy  and  Revenue  Study  Commission  recommended  that  both 
freight fees and public-private partnerships form the basis of a new Federal freight 
investment  program.  With  freight  flows  expected  to  double  over  the  next  20  to  30 
years,  I  believe  it  would  serve  the  Nation  well  to  develop  a  national  freight  policy 
to guide investment in freight infrastructure to meet these increased demands. The 
Bush Administration made little progress in developing such a plan. What are your 
thoughts on the need for a national freight policy and investment strategy? 

Answer.  I  do  believe  we  need  a  national  freight  policy  that  approaches  freight 
transportation  as  a  seamless  system  of  goods  and  product  movement  from  port  of 
entry,  whether  that  be  a  seaport,  an  energy  platform  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  or  a 
factory or farm, to place of destination. Only by maximizing all of our transportation 
options  and  streamlining  freight  movement  can  we  save  commuters  time,  and  the 
Nation energy. 

Question  3b.  Do  you  support  freight  or  user  fees  as  a  mechanism  to  finance 
freight-related  improvements  to  port,  rail,  and  highway  infrastructure  as  well  as 
intermodal facilities? 

Answer.  As  we  approach  reauthorization  of  the  surface  transportation  programs, 
we  need  to  ‘‘think  outside  the  box,’’  particularly  as  to  future  funding  mechanisms. 
We  need  to  reexamine  current  fuel  excise  taxes,  and  we  need  to  identify  additional 
revenue  resources  for  surface  transportation  programs,  including  mechanisms  to  fi-
nance  freight-related  improvements.  As  Secretary,  I  would  explore  innovative  fi-
nancing  techniques.  We  need  to  be  creative  and,  if  confirmed,  I  would  look  forward 
to hearing from all affected parties.

Question 4. In the Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 Department of Defense Authorization Act 
you  included  language  to  clarify  that  cargo  preference  laws  apply  to  any  person  or 
organization  receiving  Federal  funding,  unless  they  are  otherwise  exempted.  This 
clarification  eliminates  confusion  over  the  application  of  cargo  preference  and  will 
provide the Secretary of Transportation with the appropriate enforcement authority 
for administrative oversight of cargo preference laws. The Department of Transpor-
tation  now  needs  an  improved  method  to  track  Federal  contracts  that  involve  the 
waterborne transportation of cargo. Until such an information technology system is 
developed, enforcement will continue to be on an ad hoc basis. In last year’s Depart-
ment  of  Defense  Authorization  Act,  we  included  a  provision  to  enhance  the  Sec-
retary’s enforcement authority of our Nation’s cargo preference laws. You now have 
the responsibility to execute these changes and administer the program. Do you be-
lieve it would be helpful to establish a better methodology to track Federal contracts 
that involve the waterborne transportation of cargo under Federal contract to assist 
you in effectively enforcing the law? 

Answer.  An  improved  method  to  track  Federal  contracts  that  involve  the  water-
borne  transportation  of  cargo  would  no  doubt  benefit  many  aspects  of  government, 
including  enforcing  the  cargo  preference  laws.  The  new  law  will  enhance  enforce-
ment of cargo preference laws. 

Question 5. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is the lead Federal agency re-
sponsible  for  assisting  states  and  localities  in  addressing  their  port  infrastructure 
modernization  goals.  The  MARAD  provides  Federal  oversight  and  coordination  of 
projects, acts as a central procurement office to facilitate the leveraging Federal and 
non-Federal  funding  resources,  and  streamlines  the  environmental  review  and  per-
mitting  process.  Currently,  the  MARAD  is  managing  port  modernization  programs 
in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam. 

The Maritime Administration is assisting my home state of Hawaii with address-
ing  port  modernization  planning,  environmental  assessments,  and  construction  by 
acting as a coordinator between other Federal agencies. Similar projects are ongoing 
in  Alaska  and  now  Guam.  We  have  been  very  pleased  with  this  program  thus  far. 
What  role  do  you  believe  the  Department  of  Transportation  should  play  to  assist 
ports in addressing their complex demands in order to make the movement of goods 
more efficient, while also reducing congestion and pollution? 

Answer.  I  am  pleased  to  know  of  your  support  for  the  Maritime  Administration’s 
work  on  port  modernization.  Other  U.S.  ports  have  requested  similar  support  to 
that  in  Hawaii  to  help  them  meet  capacity  and  infrastructure  demands,  several  of 
which  are  ports  that  are  designated  as  Strategic  Ports  that  accommodate  military 
cargoes  in  times  of  emergency.  The  agency’s  Gateway  Offices,  its  day-to-day  pres-
ence  at  the  ports,  can  help  bring  agency  and  departmental  expertise  to  the  table 
for other local port projects. 

Question  6.  According  to  press  reports,  Hawaii’s  per-capita  fatality  rate  for  2006 
due  to  alcohol-related  vehicle  crashes  ranked  among  the  top  three  in  the  United 
States.  In  the  same  vein,  a  December  2008  news  article  reported  that  the  number 
of  Oahu  drunken  driving  arrests  through  October  of  2008  was  on  course  to  reach 
a  nine-year  high.  The  improvement  of  programs  intended  to  reduce  drunk  driving 
and State highway grant reform are among the issues that will be incorporated into 
the  next  surface  transportation  reauthorization  bill  under  the  Committee’s  jurisdic-
tion.  The  reduction  of  impaired  driving  is  a  primary  mission  to  be  undertaken  in 
the  next  surface  transportation  reauthorization  bill.  What  new  strategies  will  you 
deploy to address the recidivist drunk driver? 

Answer.  I  agree  with  you  that  a  focus  on  the  recidivist  drunk  driver  should  be 
central  to  new  strategies  to  deploy  in  the  fight  for  reduced  highway  fatalities  over-
all.  While  the  new  Administration’s  policy  on  specifics  of  this  nature  is  not  yet  es-
tablished,  I  would,  if  confirmed,  be  pleased  to  advise  you  of  developments  in  this 
policy area.

Question 1. Our congested roadways and skies continue to serve as a drain on our 
economy and are likely to only get more congested. The National Surface Transpor-
tation  Policy  and  Revenue  Study  Commission  laid  out  a  bold  new  vision  for  trans-
portation  policy,  and  High-Speed  Rail  figured  prominently  in  their  recommenda-
tions.  However  our  rail  infrastructure  remains  dramatically  inferior  to  most  other 
developed  countries,  with  only  a  few  miles  of  true  high-speed  rail  anywhere  in  the 
country. Do you believe high-speed rail can offer a fast, safe, and reliable means to 
travel  between  major  city  centers?  Do  you  believe  we  need  to  rethink  how  we  ap-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

proach  passenger  rail  in  this  country,  and  invest  significantly  in  developing  true 
world class high-speed rail? Would investment in high-speed rail help stimulate the 
economy  and  create  jobs?  Should  investment  in  high-speed  rail  be  part  of  an  eco-
nomic recovery package? 

Answer.  At  this  time,  the  new  Administration’s  policy  on  specifics  of  this  nature 
is not yet established. However, the recently enacted Passenger Rail Investment and 
Improvement  Act  of  2008  authorizes  a  new  high  speed  rail  development  program 
along  with  new  authorizations  for  Amtrak’s  operating  and  capital  needs  and  an 
intercity  passenger  rail  service  corridor  capital  assistance  program.  If  I  am  con-
firmed I will work to effectively implement the new legislation. 

Question 2. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) draft 
fuel economy rule under the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 
demonstrates  that  the  agency  continues  to  be  mired  in  incremental  changes  to  fuel 
economy  using  flawed  gas  and  carbon  prices  and  over-estimated  technology  costs. 
Congress explicitly provided that a 35-miler-per-gallon standard in 2020 was a floor 
not  a  ceiling.  The  Bush  Administration  has  not  finalized  its  proposed  rule.  How  do 
you anticipate moving forward to create a more robust standard setting process that 
can achieve President Obama’s critical oil savings and global warming goals? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work  to  ensure  that  final  CAFE  standards  are  con-
sistent with the best available information, including information on gas and carbon 
prices and on technology costs. 

Question 3. Last year President Bush authorized $17.5 million in loan guarantees 
to  GM  and  Chrysler.  While  these  loans  required  limits  in  executive  compensation 
and  the  sale  of  corporate  jets,  they  did  not  guarantee  any  oil  savings  or  reduced 
global warming pollution. Will you work with the Treasury Secretary to ensure that 
any  additional  financial  assistance  to  the  auto  industry  is  clearly  tied  to  exceeding 
fuel economy standards? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  I  would  work  with  the  Treasury  Secretary  and  the  other 
involved Administration officials in crafting any further financial assistance to serve 
the best interests of the Nation as a whole. 

Question  4.  In  the  near  future  the  Federal  transportation  program  will  be  up  for 
reauthorization.  While  the  bulk  of  transportation  bill  spending  has  traditionally 
gone  to  new  road  and  highway  construction,  the  bill  also  funds  our  transit  system 
and other forms of non-driving transportation. Will you work to ensure that a much 
larger  share  of  resources  are  devoted  to  public  transportation,  walking,  biking,  and 
other  forms  of  transportation  that  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  enhance 
communities? 

Answer.  Our  transportation  system  and  the  development  it  enables  must  be  sus-
tainable. We must acknowledge the new reality of climate change. This has implica-
tions  in  all  areas.  The  intercity  rail  and  mass  transit  funding  in  the  Administra-
tion’s  economic  recovery  plan  are  part  of  the  equation,  but  only  a  part.  Sustain-
ability  must  permeate  all  that  we  do,  from  highways  and  transit  to  aviation  and 
ports.  The  Administration  is  also  committed  to  focus  on  people  and  communities 
where  they  live  and  work.  This  implies  a  commitment  to  the  principles  that  some 
refer  to  as  livability—that  is,  investing  in  ways  that  respect  the  unique  character 
of each community. The era of one-size-fits-all transportation projects must give way 
to  one  where  preserving  and  enhancing  unique  community  characteristics  are  pri-
mary goals, rather than an afterthought. President Obama is committed to ensuring 
that  the  Administration’s  transportation  policy  furthers  his  goal  to  reduce  green-
house gas emissions and promote livable communities, and so am I.

Question 1. I re-introduced my Passenger Bill of Rights legislation along with my 
colleague, Senator Snowe, to prevent airline passengers from being stranded on the 
tarmac for hours without food, water, adequate restroom facilities or medical atten-
tion. Will you commit to working with us to pass and implement our passenger bill 
of rights legislation this year? 

Answer.  I  recognize  this  as  an  important  issue  and  am  aware  that  the  Depart-
ment  has  proposed  rules  to  ensure  adequate  food,  water,  and  restroom  facilities  for 
passengers during lengthy tarmac delays. I understand that the House also may be 
introducing  a  bill  on  this  issue  as  part  of  a  broader  FAA  reauthorization  package. 
If confirmed, I fully intend to work with both the Senate and House to ensure that 
appropriate passenger protections are in place. An aviation system that focuses not

67 

only on the safety and confidence of the traveling public, but also their comfort dur-
ing lengthy tarmac delays, is a successful one. 

Question  2.  Southern  California  TRACON  continues  to  experience  numerous  air 
traffic controller retirements. Air traffic controllers at Southern California TRACON 
continue  to  tell  me  the  facility  is  understaffed  and  undertrained.  Would  you  elabo-
rate  on  how  you  would  resolve  the  current  contract  dispute  between  NATCA  and 
FAA? Will you commit to reviewing the situation at Southern California Tracon and 
take appropriate action as warranted? 

Answer. I know the FAA is focused on hiring new controllers to replace the retir-
ing  workforce  and,  as  I  said  earlier,  I  am  committed  to  finding  an  Administrator 
who  will  come  to  the  job  and  work  with  Congress  and  the  controllers,  and  resolve 
contract disputes as quickly as possible. 

Question  3.  Last  September,  25  people  died  and  many  more  were  injured  when 
a  commuter  rail  train  collided  with  a  freight  train  in  Chatsworth,  California.  Fol-
lowing the tragedy, I worked along with Senator Feinstein and my colleagues on the 
Senate  Commerce  committee  to  pass  legislation  requiring  the  use  of  Positive  Train 
Control  (PTC)  on  all  track  shared  by  commuter  and  freight  rail.  Freight  rail  has 
committed to implementing positive train control in the Los Angeles basin by 2012, 
however,  the  cost  of  implementing  PTC  for  commuter  rail  remains  high.  Where  do 
you  rank  the  implementation  of  Positive  Train  Control  on  high  density  commuter/ 
freight  corridors  as  a  priority  for  DOT?  Will  you  commit  to  working  with  us  to  im-
plement Positive Train Control in Southern California by 2012? What can Congress 
do to help assist with the quick installation of PTC? 

Answer.  If  I  am  confirmed,  safety  will  continue  to  be  the  first  priority  of  the  De-
partment, and I will make it a priority to carry out the Department’s responsibilities 
under  the  recently  enacted  rail  safety  reauthorization  legislation—the  Rail  Safety 
Improvement Act of 2008, including the provisions related to the mandate that cer-
tain  railroads  implement  PTC  on  certain  lines  by  the  end  of  2015.  My  under-
standing is that the Federal Railroad Administration has already been in active con-
versation  with  the  railroads  operating  in  the  region  (Metrolink,  Amtrak,  Union  Pa-
cific,  and  BNSF),  and  all  of  those  parties  will  be  participating  through  FRA’s  Rail-
road Safety Advisory Committee to address PTC issues. If confirmed, I look forward 
to  working  with  Congress  to  ensure  that  this  and  other  safety  issues  are  success-
fully addressed. 

Question  4.  Efficient  goods  movement  is  an  issue  that  challenges  our  ports  and 
our  communities.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  residents  throughout  California  to  sit  at 
a  railroad  crossing  for  as  long  as  45  minutes  waiting  for  a  single  train  to  pass.  Do 
you believe we need a national freight program? How do you see a freight program 
working within DOT’s current transportation programs and policy? 

Answer.  I  do  believe  we  need  a  national  freight  policy  that  approaches  freight 
transportation  as  a  seamless  system  of  goods  and  product  movement  from  port  of 
entry,  whether  that  be  a  seaport,  an  energy  platform  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  or  a 
factory or farm, to place of destination. Only by maximizing all of our transportation 
options  and  streamlining  freight  movement  can  we  save  commuters  time,  and  the 
Nation energy. 

Question  5.  There  is  a  great  appetite  for  reform  in  MAP–21.  Separate  programs 
and  institutional  arrangements  for  highways,  transit,  and  rail  have  stymied  mobil-
ity and innovation in the past. Can you share your thoughts as to how to bring the 
strengths  of  these  individual  surface  modes  of  transport  together  to  serve  our  Na-
tion’s needs? 

Answer. I believe that we need a focus on at least four areas to implement Presi-
dent Obama’s national priorities for transportation—economic health, sustainability, 
safety,  and  meeting  the  needs  of  people  and  communities.  Transportation  is  a  crit-
ical  part  of  the  economy,  and  we  must  ensure  that  our  transportation  system  sup-
ports  efficient  movement  of  people  and  goods.  I  agree  that,  as  the  Administration 
develops proposals for the next transportation authorization, we must consider ways 
to  make  transportation  funding  programs  flexible  enough  to  support  the  modal  or 
intermodal  solution  that  best  meets  transportation  needs.  Improving  intermodal 
connections and reducing congestion will be an important part of that. Proposals for 
a  new  surface  transportation  authorization  will  need  to  continue  programs  that 
make  progress  toward  a  safer  transportation  system.  Our  transportation  programs 
should  support  more  environmentally  sustainable,  healthier  communities  through 
continued  efforts  to  integrate  transportation  planning  and  environmental  planning. 
Question 6. What priority would you give environmental issues when formulating 
our  Nation’s  transportation  agenda?  What  role  do  you  see  the  environment  playing 
in our Nation’s long-term transportation policy? 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:53 Jun 12, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50180.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

68 

Answer. Our transportation system and the development and economic activity it 
enables  must  be  sustainable.  Sustainability  must  permeate  all  we  do,  from  high-
ways and transit to aviation and ports. President Obama is committed to this prin-
ciple  and  so  am  I.  The  environment  is  an  area  where  the  Department  contributes 
to national goals and where I see a unique set of challenges. Making climate change 
a  top  priority  as  well  as  dealing  with  other  environmental  concerns  will  require  a 
new  level  of  attention  for  our  transportation  systems  as  well  as  a  new  mindset  for 
the  Department.  Increased  energy  efficiency  in  our  vehicles  and  our  passenger  and 
freight transportation systems will significantly alleviate the problem of greenhouse 
gases. Among the key challenges here is the development of close working relation-
ships  with  other  Cabinet  agencies  whose  goals  and  programs  overlap  with  those  of 
the Department of Transportation. 

Question 7. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that there was no 
conflict between EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles under 
the Clean Air Act, and NHTSA regulation of vehicle fuel economy under EPCA. Re-
lying  on  Massachusetts,  two  Federal  district  courts  have  since  held  that  there  is 
similarly  no  such  conflict  between  NHTSA  regulation  of  fuel  economy  under  EPCA 
and  California’s  regulation  of  CO2 emissions  from  automobiles  under  its  Clean  Air 
Act authority. 

Nevertheless,  NHTSA  heretofore  has  taken  the  position  in  its  proposed  CAFE 
rulemaking  that  such  a  conflict  exists,  and  thus  the  tailpipe  emission  standards 
adopted  by  California  and  14  other  states  under  the  Clean  Air  Act  are  preempted 
by  EPCA.  Please  confirm  that  during  your  review  of  the  proposed  CAFE  rule  you 
will  reconsider,  in  light  of  the  courts’  decisions,  NHTSA’s  position  on  this  question, 
and abide by the decisions? 

Answer. I believe a management emphasis of the new Administration is to stress 
inter-agency  coordination,  such  as  should  be  the  case  with  Clean  Air  Act  and  auto-
motive  fuel-economy  regulations,  to  a  greater  extent  than  has  been  the  case  in  the 
past. President Obama is committed to ensuring that the Administration’s transpor-
tation  policy  furthers  his  goal  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  promote  liv-
able  communities,  and  so  am  I.  If  confirmed,  I  would  expect  to  work  closely  with 
the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  to  ensure  that  fuel  economy  is  improved  and 
carbon dioxide emissions are reduced in a responsible, consistent, and effective man-
ner. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question 1. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Congressman LaHood, welcome. I join 

my colleagues in applauding your distinguished record. 

As  has  been  mentioned  here  today,  there  are  a  number  of  challenges  facing  us 
within  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  venue.  I  hope  you  will  place  strong  em-
phasis  on  implementing  CAFE  standards  and  NextGen,  on  helping  to  develop  a 
highway  bill  that  fairly  allocates  funds,  and  on  being  creative  in  the  ways  we  may 
strengthen our investments in public transit and rail systems. I would also look for-
ward to working with you and other committee members on finding ways DOT can 
help to make electric vehicle technologies a nationwide reality. 

Thank  you  for  visiting  with  us  today,  and  for  your  willingness  to  address  these 

priorities. 

My  colleagues  have  already  mentioned  the  importance  of  implementing  CAFE 
standards,  including  the  interim  model  year  2011  standards  that  the  previous  ad-
ministration  did  not  complete.  As  you  know,  NHTSA  will  use  an  estimate  of  gas 
prices to determine cost-effectiveness in the MY2011 standard, so that the potential 
expense of buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle is balanced by the consumers’ savings 
in gas. 

Last  month  the  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  revised  its  projections 
for  what  gas  will  cost  through  2030,  finding  much  higher  prices  than  were  pre-
viously predicted. If NHTSA used these new, more realistic estimates in its cost-ef-
fectiveness  calculations,  we  will  likely  see  higher—but  still  feasible—interim  CAFE 
standards.  Cong.  LaHood,  will  you  direct  NHTSA  to  use  EIA’s  latest  gas  price  pro-
jections in its CAFE standard calculations? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work  to  ensure  that  final  CAFE  standards  are  con-

sistent with the best available information, including information on gas prices. 

Question 2. Electric vehicle (EV) technologies promise fuel economy gains, energy 
security benefits and carbon emissions reductions that far surpass those of even the 
most  efficient  internal  combustion  engines.  We  are  in  a  race  with  many  countries 
around  the  globe  to  develop  not  only  electric  vehicles  themselves,  but  also  the  pio-

neering  battery  and  component  technologies  that  will  make  the  transition  to  EV’s 
a  reality.  By  developing  and  manufacturing  these  technologies  here  in  the  U.S.,  we 
can maximize the economic benefit associated with transitioning away from our fos-
sil fuel dependence—and create ‘‘green’’ jobs. Cong. LaHood, under your leadership, 
what role would the Department of Transportation play in trying to help incentivize 
investment  in  transportation  electrification  infrastructure  necessary  to  support  the 
market for EVs? Will you work with Congress to ensure this is a priority in upcom-
ing transportation legislation? 

Answer. I am committed to environmental gains and reduced carbon dioxide emis-
sions,  and  alternative-fueled  vehicles  can  play  a  major  role  in  accomplishing  these 
goals  in  the  transportation  sector.  If  confirmed,  I  plan  to  work  closely  with  Con-
gress,  the  Department  of  Energy,  and  other  involved  parties  to  ensure  that  our 
CAFE standards encourage and do not inhibit electric-vehicle developments. 

Question  3.  I  appreciate  your  indications  that  you  will  make  implementing 
NextGen  a  top  priority.  Do  we  have  your  commitment  that  you  will  work  with  this 
committee to expeditiously develop a timeline for implementation? 

Answer. I agree that NextGen is absolutely critical and I am committed to work-

ing with this committee to develop implementation timelines. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question 1a. Congressman LaHood, one of your most immediate and most impor-
tant decisions if you are confirmed as Transportation Secretary regards how the De-
partment  chooses  to  implement  the  landmark  fuel  economy  increases  enacted  into 
law  over  a  year  ago.  I  am  concerned  that  the  draft  CAFE  rule  used  an  inaccurate 
set  of  assumptions  when  coming  up  with  their  cost-benefit  calculations,  and  there-
fore failed to meet the maximum feasible standard set in 2007 Energy Bill. Are you 
aware that the CAFE increase law that Congress enacted passed in December 2007 
requires  the  Transportation  Department  to  set  CAFE  levels  at  the  ‘‘maximum  fea-
sible’’ level, not just 35 miles per gallon by 2020? 

Answer.  Yes.  It  is  the  case  that  the  35  mile-per-gallon  figure  is  only  a  minimum 

statutory requirement. 

Question  1b.  Please  comment  on  whether  you  believe  each  of  these  assumptions 

in the draft CAFE rule are accurate and appropriate: 

(i) That the price of gas will be $2.26 a gallon in 2016; 
(ii) That hybrid cars will only be available in showrooms starting in 2014; 
(iii) That there will be no commercially available plug in electric vehicles before 
2015  (despite  automaker  advertisements  and  likely  government  purchase  and 
production incentives); and 
(iv)  That  NHTSA’s  estimated  value  of  $7  per  ton  of  carbon  dioxide  is  likely  to 
be  found  arbitrary  and  capricious  based  on  what  peer-reviewed  literature  con-
cludes will be the true costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Question 1c. In Congressional testimony last year, EIA Administrator Guy Caruso 
testified  that  NHTSA  should  use  EIA’s  high  gas  price  scenario  in  its  CAFE  rule-
making. Last July, I introduced a bill that would require the Transportation Depart-
ment adopt the EIA’s ‘‘high gas price scenario’’ which would provide a more realistic 
assumption of future gas prices. Do you believe using EIA’s high gas price scenario 
will  provide  Americans  with  a  better  insurance  policy  against  future  oil  price  in-
creases  and  provide  a  more  realistic  assumption  of  what  future  gas  prices  will  be? 
Question 1d. Recent NHTSA analysis shows a 35 mpg CAFE standard in 2015 is 
technically feasible, but it’s only cost effective if gas prices range from $2.77 to $3.16 
over the next decade. Will you take into account the new data in the Energy Infor-
mation  Administration’s  forecast  report,  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2009  Early  Re-
lease, which forecasts that gasoline prices will rise each year after 2009, eventually 
reaching $3.90 per gallon in 2030? 

Answer.  I  am  confident  the  new  Administration  will  move  quickly  to  address 
CAFE  requirements.  If  confirmed,  I  will  work  to  ensure  final  CAFE  standards  are 
consistent  with  the  best  available  information,  including  information  on  gas  prices, 
carbon emissions and new technology. 

Question 2. Congressman LaHood, on February 13, 2004, NHTSA issued a memo-
randum with the subject line ‘‘Final Economic Assessment Alternative Fueled Vehi-
cles  Part  538’’  (NHTSA–01–10774–37).  On  page  10  of  that  memo,  it  says  that  the 
cost  of  making  a  vehicle  duel  fuel  capable  for  E85  would  ‘‘increase  consumer  cost 
of  a  vehicle  by  $100  to  $200  (in  $2000).’’  Is  that  estimate  still  accurate?  How  have

changes  that  automakers  made  to  fueling  components  to  meet  unrelated  emission 
standards  affected  the  marginal  costs  of  making  a  car  duel  fuel  capable.  What  is 
the  marginal  cost  of  making  a  vehicle  M85  capable,  in  other  words  able  to  run  on 
any blend of up to 85 percent methanol? What is the marginal cost of making a typ-
ical  passenger  vehicle  or  heavy  duty-truck  capable  of  running  on  any  percentage 
blend of biodiesel? 

Answer. I do not have a basis at this time to address the specific ‘‘dual-fuel capa-
bility’’  issues  you  raise,  but  I  agree  that  the  ability  to  make  use  of  alternate  fuels 
is a very central element of our Nation’s ability to wean ourselves from over-reliance 
on  foreign  petroleum  sources.  If  confirmed,  I  would  be  pleased  to  keep  you  advised 
of developments of the assumptions used in this area. 

Question  3.  Congressman  LaHood,  will  the  new  Administration  support  the  cur-
rent  Federal  laws  on  foreign  ownership  and  control  of  a  domestic  air  carrier?  In 
those  cases  where  the  ownership  structure  of  a  domestic  air  carrier  is  the  subject 
of dispute or challenge during the initial certification proceeding, do you agree that 
transparency in DOT’s review of the carrier’s ongoing compliance (post-certification) 
with U.S. foreign ownership and control laws is required in order to assure the pub-
lic and Congress that the laws are being followed? 

Answer. If confirmed, I will work to ensure that current Federal law on air carrier 
ownership  and  control  is  carried  out.  The  new  Administration’s  policy  on  specifics 
in  this  area  has  not  yet  been  established  but,  if  confirmed,  I  would  be  pleased  to 
keep you informed of relevant developments. 

Question  4a.  Congressman  LaHood,  as  you  know  the  Next  Generation  Air  Traffic 
Control  System  has  not  progressed  as  quickly  as  Congress  would  like.  When  we 
met, you told me that you are going to make this one of your priorities as Secretary. 
One of the goals of the Next Generation Air Traffic Control Joint Planning Develop-
ment  Office  is  to  encourage  coordination  between  the  Departments  of  Transpor-
tation,  Defense,  Homeland  Security,  and  other  relevant  agencies.  The  coordination 
has  not  been  as  unified  as  many  of  us  as  hoped.  Getting  these  joint  offices  to  func-
tion  properly  is  a  management  challenge  that  sometime  requires  the  Secretarial 
leadership to resolve thorny issues before they become intractable. Can we count on 
you  to  make  sure  that  NextGen  efforts  are  coordinated  across  the  participating 
agencies and that you will get involved in moving NextGen efforts forward if things 
start getting bogged down? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  NextGen  will  be  a  priority  for  me  and  for  the  Department, 
and  improved  coordination  among  the  participating  Federal  agencies  a  primary  ob-
jective.  Implementation  must  be  accomplished  within  realistic  benchmarks,  and 
there  must  be  a  commitment  from  the  Department,  Congress,  and  all  the  stake-
holders—including other Federal agencies—to ensure that it moves forward expedi-
tiously. 

Question 4b. Given the cost, complexity, and importance of the program, I believe 
it  is  critical  for  you  to  be  able  track  the  real  progress  of  NextGen  to  ensure  that 
the program is meeting the objectives and meeting the needs of our country. As you 
know,  often  measures  of  progress  are  more  focused  on  effort  rather  than  outcomes. 
Will you agree to developing and publishing metrics that show NextGen’s progress? 
Answer. I agree that meaningful metrics are absolutely critical and, if confirmed, 
I will ensure that we implement a transparent reporting process to track NextGen’s 
progress. 

Question  5.  Congressman  LaHood,  we  must  look  for  ways  to  reduce  emissions 
within  our  air  transportation  system.  Given  that  studies  show  there  are  inefficien-
cies equaling around twelve percent in the current system, will you commit to find-
ing air traffic management solutions that increase efficiencies and reduce emissions? 
Answer.  Absolutely.  I  understand  a  key  priority  of  the  NextGen  Plan  is  reducing 
the air transportation system’s environmental footprint. There are a comprehensive 
set  of  initiatives  using  new  air  traffic  management  capabilities,  enhanced  aircraft 
technology,  and  low-carbon  fuel  that  if  implemented  fully  will  allow  U.S.  aviation 
to grow while reducing its emissions.

Question  1.  As  Secretary  of  Transportation  under  a  new  Administration,  will  you 
end  Federal  Highways  Administration’s  practice  of  withholding  highway  funds  to 
states  that  are  attempting  to  address  corruption  scandals  through  pay-to-play  re-
forms  of  the  government  contracting  process,  particularly  in  Illinois  and  New  Jer-
sey?

71 

Answer.  I  believe  we  must  always  adhere  to  the  highest  ethical  standards  in  all 
our  dealings.  I  have  been  told  that  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  concern 
with  certain  State  ethics  reform  legislation  to  address  ‘‘pay-to-play,’’  including  re-
form legislation in Illinois and New Jersey is based on interpretation of a provision 
in  title  23  of  the  United  States  Code.  I  am  further  told  that  the  title  23  provision 
is  intended  to  assure  free  and  open  competition  for  Federal-aid  contracts,  and  that 
it prohibits State and local governments from adopting requirements for contractors 
that  do  not  relate  directly  to  the  contractors’  abilities  to  perform  work  under  Fed-
eral-aid  contracts.  Other  Federal  law,  of  course,  does  prohibit  corrupt  practices,  in-
cluding bribery for example, in connection with Federal-aid contracts. Nevertheless, 
I will look into this matter further, and I will take such steps as may be necessary 
to  assure  that  U.S.  DOT  is  not  unnecessarily  standing  in  the  way  of  needed  State 
ethics reform. 

Question  2.  The  newly  hired  air  traffic  controllers  who  are  just  beginning  their 
careers  at  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  are  the  future  of  Aviation 
Safety.  Will  you  see  to  it  that  they  have  the  chance  to  train  with  experienced  con-
trollers  by  doing  everything  in  your  power  to  stem  the  flow  of  veteran  controllers 
from  the  FAA  work  force,  beginning  by  returning  to  the  bargaining  table  to  reach 
collective  bargaining  agreement  with  NATCA—one  that  can  be  ratified  by  the 
union? 

Answer.  I  am  committed  to  finding  an  FAA  Administrator  who  will  come  to  the 
job  and  work  with  Congress  and  the  controllers,  and  resolve  issues  as  quickly  as 
possible. Addressing labor-management issues at the FAA is a key priority of mine. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TOM UDALL TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question  1.  Our  nation’s  transportation  system  is  currently  undergoing  a  major 
shift  and  will  continue  to  do  so  throughout  the  21st  century.  In  cities  across  this 
country,  people  are  being  urged  to  utilize  public  transportation  systems,  and  rider-
ship  of  these  systems  is  continuing  to  grow.  However,  in  many  communities  across 
this  nation,  public  transportation  is  still  not  available.  How  will  you  work  to  see 
that  our  transportation  systems  are  modernized  and  the  availability  of  these  sys-
tems  improve?  For  these  areas  where  public  transportation  is  logistically  difficult, 
how will you work to see that their transportation needs are addressed? 

Answer.  Too  many  of  our  Nation’s  railways,  highways,  bridges,  airports,  and 
neighborhood  streets  are  slowly  decaying  due  to  lack  of  investment  and  strategic 
long-term planning. President Obama believes that America’s long-term competitive-
ness  depends  on  the  stability  of  our  critical  infrastructure.  The  Administration  will 
make  strengthening  our  transportation  systems  a  top  priority.  The  Administration 
is also committed to focusing on people and communities where they live and work. 
This  implies  a  commitment  to  the  principles  that  some  refer  to  as  livability—that 
is, investing in ways that respect the unique character of each community. The era 
of  one-size-fits-all  transportation  projects  must  give  way  to  one  where  preserving 
and enhancing unique community characteristics are primary goals, rather than an 
afterthought.  And  I  intend  to  make  livable  communities  a  big  part  of  what  we  are 
going to do under reauthorization, should I be confirmed. 

Question 2. As a Representative of a rural district, you bring vital experience ad-
dressing  the  transportation  needs  of  our  rural  residents.  How  are  you  going  to  use 
this  experience  toward  addressing  the  extremely  critical  transportation  needs  of 
rural America? 

Answer. The Administration is committed to focusing on people and communities 
where they live and work, including rural communities. This implies a commitment 
to the principles that some refer to as livability—that is, investing in ways that re-
spect  the  unique  character  of  each  community.  The  era  of  one-size-fits-all  transpor-
tation  projects  must  give  way  to  one  where  preserving  and  enhancing  unique  com-
munity characteristics are primary goals, rather than an afterthought. And I intend 
to make livable communities a big part of what we are going to do under reauthor-
ization, if confirmed. The Department is currently exploring options for reauthoriza-
tion, and I am committed to working with Congress to enact surface transportation 
legislation that moves the country forward. 

Question 3. Given that the Highway Trust Fund has solvency issues, what meas-
ures  will  you  this  Administration  take  in  order  to  assure  that  adequate  funding  is 
maintained in order for the Federal Government to meet the continued need for in-
frastructure improvements?

72 

Answer.  As  we  approach  reauthorization  of  the  surface  transportation  programs, 
we  need  to  ‘‘think  outside  the  box,’’  particularly  as  to  future  funding  mechanisms. 
We  need  to  reexamine  current  fuel  excise  taxes,  and  we  need  to  identify  additional 
revenue  resources  for  surface  transportation  programs.  Innovative  financing  tech-
niques need to be further explored. I would also look to the comprehensive analyses 
of the two major Commissions established by SAFETEA-LU as the new Administra-
tion shapes proposals for our transportation future. 

Question  4.  Railroad  safety  issues  continue  to  be  a  significant  issue  across  the 
country, particularly highway grade crossings and shared use of track by freight and 
passenger rail systems. Unfortunately, Federal funding for safety measures has his-
torically been grossly insufficient to meet these safety needs. What actions will you 
take to address rail safety? 

Answer.  If  I  am  confirmed,  I  will  see  to  it  that  the  Federal  Railroad  Administra-
tion  continues  to  focus  its  inspection,  enforcement,  and  research  efforts  where  they 
are  most  likely  to  reduce  the  number  and  severity  of  railroad  accidents.  I  will  also 
make  sure  that  FRA  carries  out  the  numerous  new  safety  requirements  recently 
mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. 

Question 5. Ridership on commuter rail systems across the country has been con-
tinuously  growing  to  meet  passenger  demand,  particularly  since  the  dramatic  fluc-
tuation  of  gasoline  costs.  What  actions  will  you  pursue  to  provide  funding  for  com-
muter rail operations? 

Answer. I recognize that commuter rail operations across the country provide rid-
ers with an important transportation alternative. I am also aware that the Federal 
Government has often been an important source of funding for commuter rail oper-
ations. If confirmed, I look forward to working with Congress on this and other im-
portant transportation funding issues. 

Question  6.  Within  this  country,  transportation  is  one  of  the  largest  sources  of 
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  We  know  that  any  work  on  climate  change  policy  must 
include  input  and  action  by  the  Department.  How  do  you  see  the  DOT  working  to 
address  this  issue?  What  do  you  see  as  the  role  that  you  and  the  DOT  will  play 
in climate change policy changes? 

Answer.  Our  transportation  system  and  the  development  it  enables  must  be  sus-
tainable. We must acknowledge the new reality of climate change. This has implica-
tions  in  all  areas,  including  the  Department’s  responsibility  for  setting  automotive 
fuel-economy standards that also significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The 
intercity  rail  and  mass  transit  funding  in  the  Administration’s  economic  recovery 
plan are part of the equation, but only a part. Sustainability must permeate all that 
we do, from highways and transit to aviation and ports. The Administration is also 
committed  to  focusing  on  people  and  communities  where  they  live  and  work.  This 
implies  a  commitment  to  the  principles  that  some  refer  to  as  livability—that  is,  in-
vesting  in  ways  that  respect  the  unique  character  of  each  community.  The  era  of 
one-size-fits-all  transportation  projects  must  give  way  to  one  where  preserving  and 
enhancing  unique  community  characteristics  are  primary  goals,  rather  than  an 
afterthought.  President  Obama  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  the  Administration’s 
transportation policy furthers his goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pro-
mote livable communities, and so am I. 

Question 7. You sponsored a bill in the 105th Congress regarding motor fuel taxes 
on tribal lands and the infrastructure needs of these communities. Specifically your 
bill  prohibited  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  from  allocating  funding  for  public 
lands  highways  on  tribal  lands  unless  that  tribal  entity  has  entered  into  an  agree-
ment  with  the  state  to  provide  procedures  for  the  payment  and  collection  of  motor 
fuel  taxes  unless  the  allocation  of  funds  is  essential  to  the  construction  of  a  road 
that  is  a  critical  component  of  the  National  Highway  System  and  is  essential  to 
interstate commerce. What is your position on improving the aging and insufficient 
roads  on  tribal  lands?  How  will  the  Department  work  with  these  communities  to 
see  that  their  infrastructure  needs  are  addressed?  Do  you  still  in  believe  that  the 
Secretary  should  require  tribal  entities  to  enter  into  agreements  with  state  govern-
ments? 

Answer.  I  believe  improving  roads,  bridges,  and  other  transportation  infrastruc-
ture  across  the  Nation  will  be  a  top  priority  for  the  new  Administration,  and  that 
certainly  encompasses  roads  on  tribal  lands.  The  Indian  Reservation  Roads  (IRR) 
program  is  an  important  component  of  the  Federal-aid  highway  program.  If  con-
firmed, I would expect to be working cooperatively with tribal governments, through 
the IRR program, to address infrastructure challenges on tribal lands. 

For  most  issues  involved  in  fuel  taxation  agreements,  win-win  solutions  are  pos-
sible. Respect for tribal sovereignty and economic development on tribal lands is im-
portant, and not counter to State interests. Both States and tribes can benefit from

a  cooperative  relationship,  and  I  understand  that  a  number  of  States  and  tribes 
have  already  entered  into  agreements  for  collection  of  fuel  taxes  to  their  mutual 
benefit. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK BEGICH TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question . Representative LaHood—The White House recently issued a new Arctic 
Policy that included a new emphasis on Arctic transportation, highlighting the Mar-
itime Administration’s responsibility to protect maritime commerce in the Arctic and 
the  Arctic  environment.  As  we  see  more  and  more  summers  of  an  ice-free  Arctic, 
the  need  for  new  investments  in  Arctic  navigation,  safety  and  security  measures, 
and  new  vessel  standards  will  be  needed.  Other  countries—Russia  and  Canada  to 
be  specific—are  already  far  ahead  of  the  United  States  in  development  and  explo-
ration  of  the  Arctic  region.  In  Alaska,  many  of  our  northern  coastal  communities 
are  ill-prepared  for  either  increased  shipping  or  increased  development  in  the  re-
gion. 

Representative LaHood, do I have your commitment that your Department, espe-
cially  the  Maritime  Administration,  will  make  it  a  priority  to  ensure  that  Arctic 
shipping  lanes  off  the  Alaska  coast  are  equipped  with  the  highest  level  of  naviga-
tion, emergency response, and security equipment and expertise so the we can move 
forward  to  develop  our  Arctic  resources  without  jeopardizing  the  very  fragile  Arctic 
environment? 

Answer.  The  national  priorities  for  maritime  transportation  in  the  Arctic  region 
should address safe, secure, and reliable navigation, the protection of maritime com-
merce,  and  the  protection  of  the  environment.  The  Maritime  Administration  is  cur-
rently  overseeing  a  three-year,  ongoing  project  called  the  Arctic  Maritime  Shipping 
Assessment. This project will address issues such as safe and secure maritime navi-
gation, search and rescue issues, the protection of maritime commerce and environ-
ment,  the  development  of  the  necessary  infrastructure  to  support  these  initiatives, 
and the welfare and impact on existing communities in the Arctic area. If confirmed, 
I  commit  to  working,  in  cooperation  with  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  (who 
oversees  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard)  and  other  appropriate  agencies,  to  ensure  that  any 
development  of  maritime  trade  and  commerce  utilizing  the  Arctic  as  a  trade  route 
will be implemented in a safe, secure and environmentally responsible manner.

Question  1.  Mr.  LaHood,  this  Committee,  and  its  members,  have  long  enjoyed  a 
close  and  productive  working  relationship  with  the  Department  of  Transportation. 
We  often  rely  on  the  technical  and  legal  expertise  of  the  Department’s  staff  when 
we  are  developing  or  reviewing  proposed  legislation.  Can  members  of  this  Com-
mittee count on this cooperative relationship continuing? 

Answer. If confirmed, I commit to continuing the close working relationship exist-
ing  between  the  Department  and  Congress—and  especially  this  committee.  I  would 
truly appreciate the opportunity to continue providing the committee with technical 
assistance  and  am  certain  that  it  will  serve  to  enhance  the  objectives  of  both  Con-
gress and the Department. 

Question 2. Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) gave a pre-
liminary estimate of how quickly the funds in the House economic stimulus bill will 
be  spent.  According  to  CBO  of  the  $43.1  billion  included  for  transportation  pro-
grams,  only  $6.3  billion  or  14.6  percent  will  enter  the  economy  by  September  30, 
2010.  This  hardly  seems  like  it  would  have  a  major  stimulative  effect  on  the  econ-
omy.  What  can  you  do  to  ensure  the  taxpayer  that  any  funds  Congress  provides, 
first  and  foremost  stimulates  the  economy  and  creates  job,  and  two,  does  so  in  the 
most timely manner? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  I  will  ensure  that  the  Department  works  with  the  States 
and  other  relevant  potential  grant  recipients  so  that  grant  funds  will  be  dedicated 
to projects that have been planned, organized and meet agency requirements before 
the  funds  are  committed—in  essence  ‘‘shovel  ready″.  This,  we  expect,  will  help  put 
people  to  work  as  early  as  this  summer  working  on  roads,  bridges,  transit,  airport 
projects, and other important infrastructure projects. 

Question  3.  An  early  challenge  you  will  face  as  Secretary  will  be  easing  the  rela-
tionship between FAA Management and its unions. As you know, the new Adminis-
tration has full discretion to renegotiate labor agreements, but I would hope you will

consider  the  fiscal  ramifications  of  reopening  the  current  NATCA  air  traffic  con-
troller  contract  which  could  potentially  cost  the  FAA  $1.9  billion  through  the  year 
2011.  During  these  difficult  economic  times  I  find  it  hard  to  justify  such  expendi-
tures for a workforce that is already some of the highest paid in the Federal Govern-
ment.  In  order  to  ease  future  management/labor  tensions,  will  you  work  with  the 
Committee to create a prospective labor contract impasse process that allows for fair 
and final closure of controversial contract issues? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  one  of  my  top  priorities  is  to  find  the  most  talented  FAA 
Administrator  that  we  can  find,  and  recommend  that  person  to  President  Obama, 
so  he  can  recommend  that  person  to  the  Senate  for  confirmation.  I  am  committed 
to  finding  an  Administrator  who  will  work  with  Congress  and  the  controllers  to  re-
solve issues as quickly as possible. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JIM DEMINT TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question  1.  What  do  you  foresee  as  the  most  immediate  need  at  the  Department 

of Transportation? 

Answer. While maintaining transportation safety as the Department’s preeminent 
goal, the most immediate need will be to implement the Economic Recovery Act rap-
idly,  as  soon  as  it  is  enacted,  and  emphasize  projects  that  are  ready-to-go  and  will 
also  contribute  long-term  to  the  economic  vitality  of  this  country.  It  is  imperative 
that expenditures be closely tracked, to ensure that they are expended in accordance 
with the law and good policy, and to be able to measure their positive effect on eco-
nomic recovery, as Congress intends. 

Question  2.  What  do  you  believe  is  the  Federal  Government’s  role  in  transpor-

tation policy? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  the  major  challenges  facing  the  Department  of  Transpor-
tation relate to its support of key national objectives of safety and mobility. The De-
partment’s  programs  and  activities  must  contribute  to  solutions  in  areas  critical  to 
the  Nation’s  future.  In  the  area  of  the  economy,  efficient  and  safe  infrastructure  is 
a fundamental requirement for recovery and growth. As a nation, we need to invest 
in our highways, bridges, ports, air and rail systems to strengthen user safety, bol-
ster our long-term competitiveness and ensure that our economy achieves its growth 
potential.  Through  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  programs,  sound  and  well 
managed investments will move us in the right direction. Leadership in the Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  is  needed  to  set  the  objectives  in  these  areas,  gain  support 
for the resources needed and provide benchmarks to gauge progress. 

In  the  area  of  energy,  the  transportation  system  must  play  a  central  role  in  con-
servation  and  sound  development  of  energy  resources.  The  fuel  economy  of  the  Na-
tion’s  automobile  fleet  must  continue  to  improve,  and  I  look  forward  to  working 
within the Administration and with the auto industry to achieve this goal. Investing 
in  advanced  vehicle  technology  and  development  of  supportive  policies  for  alter-
native-energy  vehicles,  will  also  be  an  important  contribution  to  the  national  goals. 
So will the Department’s support of efficient transportation modes and effective pub-
lic  transportation  in  our  cities.  Making  these  initiatives  happen  is  a  key  challenge, 
involving  both  resources  and  hands-on  management  and  the  revitalization  of  the 
Department’s research and development skills. 

Environment is another area where the Department contributes to national goals 
and  where  I  see  a  key  set  of  challenges.  Making  global  warming  a  top  priority  as 
well as dealing with other environmental concerns will require a new level of atten-
tion  for  our  transportation  systems  as  well  as  a  new  mindset  for  the  Department’s 
leadership. Increased energy efficiency in our vehicles and our passenger and freight 
transportation  systems  will  significantly  alleviate  the  problem  of  greenhouse  gases. 
Among  the  key  challenges  here  is  the  development  of  close  working  relationships 
with other Cabinet agencies whose goals and programs overlap with those of the De-
partment of Transportation. 

Question 3. The highway system is at a crisis. GAO first predicted that the High-
way  Trust  Fund  was  unsustainable  at  its  current  levels,  and  last  Congress,  tax-
payers had to bailout the transportation sector. What do you propose for restricting 
the way highways are funded? 

Answer.  As  we  approach  the  renewal  of  the  surface  transportation  programs,  we 
need  to  ‘‘think  outside  the  box,’’  particularly  as  to  future  funding  mechanisms.  We 
need  to  reexamine  current  fuel  excise  taxes  and  evaluate  new  proposals  and  ideas. 
I  would  also  look  to  the  comprehensive  analyses  of  the  two  major  Policy  Commis-
sions  established  by  SAFETEA-LU  as  the  new  Administration  shapes  proposals  for 
our transportation future.

Question  4.  The  last  administration  was  progressive  with  looking  for  new  ways 
and  opportunities  to  give  states  the  flexibility  to  fund  infrastructure  projects,  will 
you  office  continue  to  push  public  private  partnerships  as  a  means  to  operate  our 
highway  system?  Will  your  office  continue  to  consult  with  cities  and  counties  on 
their development of contracts with private companies? 

Answer.  As  I  indicated  above,  we  need  to  ‘‘think  outside  the  box,’’  and  the  use  of 

new financing tools is one of the ways to do this. 

Question 5. Will you recognize earmarks if they deviate from your agency’s trans-
portation  policy?  Congressman  LaHood,  I  want  to  get  your  perspective  on  the  prac-
tice  of  Congressional  earmarking.  Last  February  The  State  Journal-Register  re-
ported  the  following  quote  from  you,  ‘‘’If  people  like  Ray  LaHood  and  others  aren’t 
able  to  earmark  dollars,  that  money  will  be  spent  by  some  bureaucrat  in  Wash-
ington,  D.C.,  and  who  knows  better  how  to  spend  money  on  worthwhile  projects 
than a community and an individual Congressman?’ LaHood said. You seem to take 
a  fairly  dim  view  of  the  thousands  of  Federal  ‘‘bureaucrats’’  you  will  be  leading  at 
the Department of Transportation. 
a. Do you regret these comments? 
b.  Will  the  Department  of  Transportation  budget  be  more  effectively  executed 

with or without earmarks? 

c.  When  earmarks  aren’t  written  into  law—such  as  when  they  are  in  committee 
reports, letters or phoned in by members—will you use the merit review procedures 
at  the  Department  of  Transportation  to  fund  projects  or  will  you  abide  by  the  sug-
gestions of influential Members of Congress? 

Answer. I need to be clear, first, that I would be honored to head the Department 
of  Transportation  and  be  able  to  work  with  the  extremely  high-quality  workforce 
there.  My  view  as  a  Member  of  Congress  might  better  have  been  expressed  simply 
that  sometimes  a  ‘‘one  size  fits  all’’  government  policy  is  maintained  despite  the 
clear case for a particular project in a specific set of circumstances. The more impor-
tant point, however, is that the President opposes earmarks and that, were I to join 
the Administration, I would have a clear policy to carry out as a part of the execu-
tive  branch.  I  believe  that  the  President’s  policy  will  govern  the  particulars  of  car-
rying  out  the  law,  and  accompanying  reports,  and  I  would  look  forward  to  imple-
menting his policy. 

Question 6. According to a U.S. Department of Transportation report in December 
2004,  Amtrak  is  by  far  the  most  heavily  subsidized  mode  of  travel  in  the  U.S.  Be-
tween  its  huge  Federal  subsidies  and  it  minuscule  share  of  the  intercity  passenger 
market  (less  than  1  percent).  Amtrak  has  misused  their  Federal  funds  and  has 
failed to organize to make itself self sustainable. How will your agency force Amtrak 
to organize to become self sustainable? 

Answer. As Secretary of Transportation, I would serve as a member of the Amtrak 
board  of  directors,  and  I  would  work  to  make  the  system  as  efficient  as  possible, 
recognizing that intercity passenger rail is often subsidized to some degree through-
out the world because of its contributions to reduced congestion and urban air qual-
ity.  I  also  note  that  several  provisions  of  the  just  enacted  ‘‘Passenger  Rail  Invest-
ment  and  Improvement  Act  of  2008’’  address  use  of  Federal  funds,  including  re-
quirements  for  improved  financial  accounting,  development  of  a  five-year  financial 
plan, and development of methodologies for Amtrak route and service planning deci-
sions and metrics, and standards for measuring the performance and service quality 
of  intercity  passenger  train  operations.  If  confirmed,  I  would  make  implementation 
of these financing reforms a priority. 

Question  7.  A  2006  GAO  report  stated  ‘‘the  existing  intercity  passenger  rail  sys-
tem is in poor financial condition and the current structure does not effectively tar-
get Federal funds to where they provide the greatest public benefits, such as trans-
portation  congestion  relief.  Routes  of  750  miles  or  more,  while  providing  service  for 
from  rural  areas  and  connections  between  regions,  show  limited  public  benefits  for 
dollars  expended.  These  routes  account  for  15  percent  of  riders  but  80  percent  of 
financial  losses.’’  How  will  you  establish  a  system  to  eliminate  some  of  Amtrak’s 
least profitable lines? Will you entertain private company offers to purchase Amtrak 
routes and rail lines? 

Answer.  At  this  time,  the  new  Administration’s  policy  on  specifics  of  this  nature 
is not yet established but, if confirmed, I would be pleased to advise you of develop-
ments  in  the  area  of  the  future  of  Amtrak’s  route  structure.  The  recently  enacted 
Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 includes the development 
of a pilot program allowing rail carriers to seek to be considered as alternative pas-
senger  rail  providers.  If  I  am  confirmed,  I  will  work  to  effectively  implement  the 
new legislation.

Question 8. How do you plan to pay for next-gen technology for the air traffic con-
trol system? Do you plan to impose a new flat fee on general aviation for costs asso-
ciated with air traffic control services? 

Answer.  As  I  expressed  earlier  about  ‘‘thinking  outside  the  box’’  with  regard  to 
the  future  financing  of  surface  transportation  programs,  we  need  to  approach  the 
critical element of financing our aviation programs in the future with an open mind. 
That said, I would like to work with Congress throughout the FAA’s reauthorization 
process to address these very issues. 

Question  9.  Do  you  support  the  National  Air  Traffic  Controllers  attempt  to  nego-

tiate their contract to pre-2006 level? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  the  FAA  will  work  best  with  a  satisfied  work  force,  one 
that  wants  to  come  to  work  each  day,  and  I  am  a  supporter  of  good-faith  collective 
bargaining between employee groups and management. 

Question 10. How do you plan to recruit new air traffic controllers? 
Answer. This is a very important issue because of the critical nature of air traffic 
control functions to aviation safety. That said, I would need to consult with the ex-
perts at the Federal Aviation Administration, and get the benefit of the perspective 
of a new FAA Administrator, before offering specifics in this area. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN THUNE TO 

HON. RAY LAHOOD 

Question  1.  Do  you  believe  the  current  highway  bill  is  an  equitable  formula  that 
should  serve  as  a  fair  model  for  the  2009  Highway  Bill?  Are  there  provisions  you 
would change to the current bill? 

Answer.  As  we  approach  reauthorization  of  the  surface  transportation  programs, 
we  need  to  ‘‘think  outside  the  box,’’  particularly  as  to  future  funding  mechanisms. 
This  includes  investing  in  ways  that  respect  the  unique  character  of  each  commu-
nity. The era of one-size-fits-all transportation projects must give way to one where 
preserving and enhancing unique community characteristics, be they rural or urban, 
is  a  primary  goal,  rather  than  an  afterthought.  And  I  intend  to  make  livable  com-
munities  a  big  part  of  what  we  are  going  to  do  under  reauthorization.  I  am  com-
mitted  to  working  with  Congress  to  enact  surface  transportation  legislation  that 
moves the country forward. 

Question 2. Essential Air Service plays an important role in South Dakota’s econ-
omy.  Do  you  foresee  any  recommendations  from  the  Obama  Administration  that 
would  change  the  Essential  Air  Service  program  or  limit  air  service  in  rural  areas 
such as South Dakota? 

Answer.  I  believe  that  air  service  plays  an  important  role  as  an  economic  engine 
for communities to enhance their livability. I look forward to working with Congress 
to  help  make  the  EAS  program  as  efficient  as  possible  to  ensure  that  eligible  com-
munities maintain a link to the national transportation system. 

Question  3.  Throughout  South  Dakota,  ethanol  plants,  grain  elevators,  power 
plants  and  a  variety  of  other  shippers  are  captive  to  only  one  railroad.  In  which 
case,  their  only  hope  for  rate  relief  is  through  the  Surface  Transportation  Board 
(STB).  Do  you  believe  the  STB  is  in  need  of  reform?  If  so,  what  types  of  reforms 
do you believe would provide captive shippers with much needed rate relief? 

Answer.  At  this  time,  the  new  Administration’s  policy  on  specifics  of  this  nature 
is  not  yet  established  but,  if  confirmed,  I  would  expect  the  Department  to  focus  on 
this important aspect of freight transportation. 

Question  4.  California  Governor  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  has  asked  President 
Barack  Obama  to  waive  or  greatly  streamline  Federal  requirements  under  the  Na-
tional  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  for  several  infrastructure  projects  in  order 
to spur job growth and expedite construction of new roads, mass transit and energy 
systems  in  California.  What  is  your  opinion  of  the  Governor’s  request?  Will  the 
Obama  Administration  consider  the  economic  urgency  of  job  creation  by  setting 
aside  or  streamlining  NEPA  review  when  moving  forward  on  any  infrastructure 
based  stimulus  proposal?  Separate  from  any  stimulus  proposal,  would  you  as  Sec-
retary consider the need to shorten the length of time it takes to complete environ-
mental reviews of transportation projects a priority? 

Answer. Our immediate priority will be to implement the Economic Recovery Act 
rapidly,  as  soon  as  it  is  enacted,  and  emphasize  projects  that  are  ready-to-go  and 
will also contribute to the long-term economic vitality of the Nation. I intend to de-
velop close working relationships with other agencies whose programs interact with 
those  of  the  Department  of  Transportation  to  streamline  environmental  reviews 
whenever possible, while protecting the environment.

Question  5.  SAFETEA–LU  included  several  provisions  aimed  at  shortening  the 
amount  of  time  it  takes  to  complete  environmental  reviews  of  highway  projects. 
Some  of  these  provisions,  however,  seem  to  have  issues  with  implementation  that 
have  resulted  in  little  improvement  in  project  delivery  times.  As  Secretary,  would 
you  support  efforts  to  improve  these  provisions?  In  particular,  would  you  support 
efforts  to  allow  States  to  assume  the  responsibilities  of  the  Secretary  of  Transpor-
tation  for  environmental  reviews?  Would  you  support  efforts  to  further  rationalize 
the section 4(f) review process? 

Answer.  I  support  increasing  the  efficiency  of  project  reviews  and  will  consider 
new  approaches  to  improving  delivery  times  while  ensuring  that  important  re-
sources are protected. 

Question 6. Executive Order 13274 was intended to enhance environmental stew-
ardship  as  well  as  streamline  the  environmental  review  and  development  of  trans-
portation  projects.  Among  other  things,  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  is  directed 
to  designate,  and  amend  as  appropriate,  a  list  of  high-priority  transportation 
projects to receive expedited agency reviews. What are your thoughts on the benefits 
or drawbacks of this Executive Order? Would you support continued implementation 
of it during the Obama Administration? 

Answer.  I  am  committed  to  efficient  transportation  project  delivery  and,  if  con-
firmed, intend to develop close working relationships with other agencies whose re-
sponsibilities  interact  with  the  Department’s,  in  order  to  streamline  environmental 
reviews  while  ensuring  that  the  Department  fulfills  its  environmental  stewardship 
responsibilities.  Executive  Order  13274  provides  a  framework  for  working  with 
other agencies toward these goals. 

Question  7.  In  SAFETEA–LU,  the  Congress  included  some  modifications  to  the 
program aimed at improving the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of the Con-
gestion  Mitigation  and  Air  Quality  program  (CMAQ).  What  are  your  thoughts  on 
the CMAQ program? Do you have any ideas on how to improve it further? 

Answer.  Environment  is  another  area  where  the  Department  contributes  to  na-
tional  goals  and  where  I  see  a  key  set  of  challenges.  Making  global  warming  a  top 
priority  as  well  as  dealing  with  other  environmental  concerns  will  require  a  new 
level  of  attention  for  our  transportation  systems  as  well  as  a  new  focus  for  the  De-
partment. Increased energy efficiency in our vehicles and our passenger and freight 
transportation  systems  will  significantly  alleviate  the  problem  of  greenhouse  gases.
