The NASA Administrator’s Speech to
Office of Inspector General Staff, the

Subsequent Destruction of Video Records,

and Associated Matters

THURSDAY, MAY 24, 2007

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Background

Since early 2006, Robert Cobb, the Inspector General of the National Aeronautics
and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  has  been  under  investigation  for  allegations  of
misconduct. After a review of 79 allegations, in early 2007, the Integrity Committee
of  the  President’s  Council  on  Integrity  and  Efficiency  (PCIE),  an  organization  of
agency inspectors general, issued a report finding that Mr. Cobb had abused his au-
thority  and  demonstrated  the  appearance  of  a  lack  of  independence  from  the  agen-
cy’s  top  officials,  particularly  Sean  O’Keefe,  NASA’s  former  administrator.  Most  of
the allegations came from current and former employees of NASA’s Office of Inspec-
tor General (OIG).

The  Committee  has  been  tracking  this  investigation  since  2006  and  made  re-
peated requests for the final report and its supporting documentation over a several-
month period until it was released to the Committee in late March of 2007. On April
2, 2007, Chairmen Miller and Gordon called for the removal of Mr. Cobb. Since that
time,  the  Committee,  along  with  the  Senate  Subcommittee  on  Space,  Aeronautics,
and related Sciences has been conducting interviews in preparation for hearings on
the Cobb investigation.

The  criteria  used  by  the  PCIE  are  set  forth  in  Executive  Order  12993,  which  in-
cludes  an  ‘‘abuse  of  authority’’  as  one  of  the  allegations  that  must  be  investigated.
The PCIE also has developed the ‘‘Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector
General,’’  which  all  IGs  are  required  to  meet.  They  include  integrity,  objectivity,
independence, professional judgment and confidentiality. Independence is defined as
a ‘‘critical element of objectivity. Without independence, both in fact and in appear-
ance, objectivity is impaired.’’

The PCIE’s Integrity Committee, which conducted the investigation, recommended
action be taken against Mr. Cobb up to and including dismissal. That recommenda-
tion  was  sent  to  Clay  Johnson  III,  the  head  of  PCIE  and  deputy  director  for  man-
agement  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  for  further  action.  Mr.  Johnson
sent the report on to Michael Griffin, NASA’s Administrator, and asked him to pro-
pose a corrective action plan for Mr. Cobb.

Griffin turned the task of studying the hundreds of pages of material and crafting
a set of potential actions over to his General Counsel, Michael Wholley. Mr. Wholley
independently decided to apply his own standards to the work of the HUD Inspector
General and re-judge the case based on that report. This was completely outside the
scope  of  the  assignment  to  Mr.  Griffin  contemplated  in  the  Executive  Order.  Mr.
Wholley,  asking  what  laws  had  been  violated,  determined  that  the  Integrity  Com-
mittee  got  it  all  wrong  when  they  declared  Mr.  Cobb  to  have  abused  the  authority
of  his  office.  In  fact,  Mr.  Wholley  seemed  hard  pressed  to  find  that  Mr.  Cobb  had
done  anything  wrong  at  all.  Notably,  Mr.  Wholley  has  developed  a  mentor-prote´ge´
relationship with Cobb and so his actions bear out the finding of the Integrity Com-
mittee  that  at  least  the  appearance  of  a  lack  of  independence  exists.  Mr.  Wholley
was blind to that situation as he went about his self-defined task.

Upon the suggestion of Mr. Johnson, the plan for dealing with Mr. Cobb included
a meeting between Mr. Griffin and the staff of the Office of Inspector General (OIG)
to  inform  them  that  Mr.  Griffin  had  reviewed  the  Integrity  Committee’s  Record  of
Investigation  and  taken  ‘‘the  actions  that  I  believe  are  necessary  to  address  the

ROI’s findings.’’ In a letter to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Griffin also said that he would ‘‘lis-
ten  to  any  concerns  that  may  exist  among  the  staff  and. . .express  my  support  for
a strong and effective Office of Inspector General.’’

In  early  April,  Mr.  Griffin  made  public  statements  questioning  the  conclusions  of
the  PCIE  report.  He  claimed  to  have  reviewed  the  report  himself—although  there
is  no  evidence  of  that—and  found  no  evidence  of  an  ‘‘abuse  of  office’’  ‘‘lack  of  integ-
rity’’  or  ‘‘actual  conflict  of  interest’’  or  ‘‘improprieties.’’  He  expressed  his  support  for
Mr.  Cobb,  said  he  would  not  recommend  his  removal,  and  that  Mr.  Cobb’s  ‘‘impar-
tiality’’  was  not  in  question.  Mr.  Griffin  said  there  were  examples  of  ‘‘overly  harsh
treatment  of  subordinates;  verbal  treatment’’  by  Mr.  Cobb,  and  that  he  would  rec-
ommend that Mr. Cobb take management courses at the Federal Executive Institute
every year, have a management coach, and report on his progress to NASA’s Deputy
Administrator.

The ‘‘all-hands’’ mandatory meeting was scheduled for April 10 at 2:30 p.m. Before
the  meeting,  several  persons  expressed  concern  about  the  NASA  Administrator’s
prior  supportive  statements  concerning  Mr.  Cobb  and  questioned  whether  holding
such a meeting with the OIG staff gave the appearance that the Administrator was
asserting control over the independent Inspector General’s office.

Because  OIG  employees  are  located  at  headquarters  and  several  NASA  centers,
the meeting was videoconferenced. Prior to that meeting, Paul Morrell, Mr. Griffin’s
Chief  of  Staff,  said  he  told  the  contract  employee  running  the  Video  Teleconfer-
encing  Service  (ViTS)  center  not  to  record  the  session,  although  the  employee  does
not  recall  that  directive.  However,  during  the  planning  for  the  meeting,  a  NASA
public affairs officer requested a DVD be made of the meeting, and when the meet-
ing was actually held, there were multiple signs (as many as 8) noting that the ses-
sion was being recorded. It was subsequently learned that at least two of the NASA
centers  also  videotaped  the  session  so  that  employees  who  were  not  present  could
view  the  meeting.  This  appears  to  be  a  standard  practice  in  NASA  IG  staff  ‘‘all
hands’’ videoconferences.
The Meeting

Mr. Griffin addressed the meeting, which was also attended by Mr. Cobb. Accord-
ing  to  written  reports  from  attendees  of  the  meeting,  Mr.  Griffin  went  far  beyond
a  simple  recitation  of  his  support  for  Mr.  Cobb,  the  facts  of  Mr.  Cobb’s  corrective
action plan, and an assurance of independence for the OIG’s office. Mr. Griffin indi-
cated that he was not interested in the OIG’s program or operational audits because
the OIG staff did not have the technical skills to audit in that area, that OIG audi-
tors should not be questioning NASA management decisions, and that he would not
pay  attention  to  findings  that  didn’t  result  in  savings  in  the  hundreds  of  millions
of dollars. Attendees at the meetings also indicated that it was inappropriate for Mr.
Cobb to be at the meeting if open and honest dialogue was the goal.
Destruction of the Video Records of the Meeting

Early  on  April  11,  Mr.  Griffin’s  Chief  of  Staff  called  the  ViTS  center  employee.
At  the  request  of  the  Public  Affairs  Office,  the  employee  had  created  an  original
DVD and four copies, which were to be provided to various offices. Mr. Morrell told
the  ViTS  employee  that  this  meeting  was  not  to  be  recorded  and  to  get  back  the
DVD  and  the  copies.  The  ViTS  employee  did  so,  and  also  called  all  of  the  centers
and told them to destroy the copies that they had. In a dramatic moment, the ViTS
person at one center actually destroyed a videotape by beating it with a shelf board.
Mr. Morrell claims that he never even asked about whether the Centers might have
tapes; the ViTS staffer remembers this somewhat differently and is fairly confident
he was following Mr. Morrell’s orders when he asked the Center ViTS people to col-
lect and destroy tapes.

At  headquarters  that  morning,  Mr.  Morrell  collected  all  of  the  DVDs  and  then
gave  them  to  Michael  Wholley,  NASA’s  General  Counsel.  Some  time  later,  Mr.
Wholley destroyed the DVDs by breaking them up with his hands. Mr. Wholley later
told Committee staff that he did so because he wanted to be sure that no one could
obtain  the  DVD  by  filing  a  request  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA).
Congressional Request

On  April  18,  the  Committee  learned  of  the  April  10  meeting  and  the  possible  de-
struction  of  the  video  recordings  of  that  meeting  and  sent  letters  to  Administrator
Griffin  and  Inspector  General  Cobb  requesting  a  copy  of  the  videotape  and  all
records  related  to  it.  When  the  response  stated  that  all  copies  had  been  destroyed,
the Committee asked for all records relating to Mr. Griffin’s review of the PCIE re-
port,  the  April  10  meeting  with  the  OIG  staff  and  the  destruction  of  the  video
records.

Committee Investigation

5

Ever since Mr. Johnson put the responsibility on Mr. Griffin to develop and imple-
ment  a  corrective  action  plan  for  NASA’s  Inspector  General,  there  have  been  con-
cerns in Congress and elsewhere that it would be difficult for Mr. Cobb to maintain
his  independence  from  NASA  management  when  he  owed  his  continuance  as
NASA’s  IG  to  Mr.  Griffin  and  his  General  Counsel.  This  is  of  particular  concern  as
one of the substantiated allegations was that Mr. Cobb did not demonstrate the ap-
pearance  of  a  lack  of  independence  of  the  prior  NASA  Administrator  and  General.
Staff  review  of  the  responsive  documents  and  follow-up  interviews  indicate  a  dis-
turbing lack of concern by NASA management about maintaining the independence
of its Office of Inspector General.

The  actions  by  staff  at  the  highest  levels  of  NASA  to  physically  destroy  records
of  a  questionable  meeting  between  the  Administrator  and  the  OIG  staff  points  to
a  serious  lack  of  public  accountability.  It  is  unprecedented  for  a  General  Counsel
to personally and knowingly destroy agency records so that they cannot be obtained
by  Congress  or  the  public.  Apologies  referring  to  the  use  of  ‘‘stupid  pills’’  are  not
acceptable for a person in such a position of public trust and responsibility.

In its hearing, the Committee will hear from witnesses personally involved in both

the meeting and the destruction of its record.
Witnesses:

The  first  two  witnesses  are  current,  high-ranking  staff  of  the  NASA  Inspector
General’s office. They will testify as to the impact of Dr. Griffin’s address to the OIG
staff. They also have insights into the destruction of tapes.

• Kevin Winters, Assistant  Inspector  General  for  Investigations,  NASA  Office

of Inspector General

The  second  panel  of  witnesses  can  speak  to  the  disposition  of  the  Cobb  case  by
NASA  when  it  was  presented  to  the  agency  by  PCIE.  They  can  also  speak  to  the
relationship  between  Cobb  and  Wholley.  Finally,  they  can  address  the  manner  and
motive  for  destroying  the  recordings  of  Administrator  Griffin’s  appearance  before
the IG staff.

Chairman  MILLER.  Good  morning.  The  hearing  will  come  to

order.

In  January,  the  Integrity  Committee  of  the  President’s  Council
on  Integrity  and  Efficiency,  PCIE,  completed  an  investigation  into
allegations  of  misconduct  by  Robert  ‘‘Moose’’  Cobb,  the  Inspector
General  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration,
NASA.

The report was damning. The report found that Mr. Cobb abused
his authority and showed a lack of the appearance of independence
from  NASA  management,  and  concluded  that  discipline  up  to  and
including removal was appropriate. After reading the report, Chair-
man  Gordon  and  I  of  this  committee,  and  Senator  Bill  Nelson,  the
Chair  of  the  counterpart  committee  in  the  Senate,  called  upon
President Bush to remove Mr. Cobb as Inspector General of NASA.
Mr.  Cobb  continues  to  serve  at  the  pleasure  of  the  President.  It
apparently  continues  to  please  President  Bush  for  Mr.  Cobb  to
serve  as  the  NASA  Inspector  General.  This  committee,  this  sub-
committee,  will  hear  from  Mr.  Cobb  and  others  in  the  next  weeks
concerning  the  allegations  of  misconduct  that  were  the  subject  of
the PCIE report.

As  damning  as  the  report  was,  it  appears  on  closer  examination
that  the  report  was  overly  generous.  The  subject  of  this  hearing  is
the conduct of NASA officials in handling the Cobb matter. Specifi-
cally,  this  hearing  concerns  a  meeting  with  the  staff  of  the  Office
of  Inspector  General  of  NASA,  a  meeting  that  all  staff  members
were  expected  to  attend,  a  meeting  at  which  Mr.  Cobb  sat  beside
Administrator Michael Griffin while Administrator Griffin disputed
the  findings  of  the  PCIE  report.  NASA  officials  certainly  have
known  that  such  a  meeting  would  only  further  the  appearance  of
a lack of independence by the NASA Inspector General.

In  his  prepared  statement  today,  Michael  Wholley,  the  General
Counsel  of  NASA,  is  in  high  dudgeon  about  the  accounts  of  NASA
employees who attended the meeting, which he testifies range from
the  patently  false  to  the  ridiculous.  He  asserts  that  this  sub-
committee should be skeptical of allegations slipped under the door
or thrown over the transom, often anonymously or with the request
for anonymity. That is exactly how whistleblowers provide informa-
tion to oversight committees of Congress and to Inspector Generals
acting independently, as required by statute.

We  could  have  known  for  certain  just  exactly  what  happened  at
that  meeting,  and  not  had  to  decide  between  wildly  conflicting  ac-
counts, decide which accounts to believe, because there was a DVD
made  of  the  meeting,  and  then  copies  were  made  of  the  DVD.  Mr.
Wholley  personally  destroyed  those  tapes.  A  great  American  law-
yer, Elihu Root, said that about half the practice of a decent lawyer
is  telling  would-be  clients  that  they  are  damn  fools  and  should
stop.  That  is  a  view  of  the  ethical  expectations  of  a  lawyer  that  I
learned  in  law  school,  and  it  remains  the  expectation  set  forth  in
the Code of Professional Responsibility.

Instead, the view within NASA apparently was that DVDs could
be  destroyed  absent  advice  that  any  legal  arguments  that  the
DVDs  should  be  preserved  was 
‘‘categorically  fatally  legally
flawed.’’  I  worry  that  the  ethical  obligations  of  a  lawyer  that  I

learned  in  law  school  are  now  regarded  as  quaint  and  antiquated
like the Geneva Convention.

NASA  officials,  Mr.  Wholley  and  Paul  Morrell,  knew  that  there
were questions about the propriety of the meeting. They knew that
the Cobb matter was a subject of interest by the oversight commit-
tees of the House and the Senate. They knew that the DVD of the
meeting  would  be  subject  to  disclosure,  and  Mr.  Wholley  made  a
conscious decision to destroy the DVDs. It is impossible not to con-
clude the worst from that conduct.

matter.

Good morning. In January, the Integrity Committee of the President’s Council on
Integrity  and  Efficiency  (PCIE)  completed  an  investigation  into  allegations  of  mis-
conduct by Robert ‘‘Moose’’ Cobb, the Inspector General of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). The report was damning.

The  report  found  that  Mr.  Cobb  abused  his  authority  and  showed  a  lack  of  the
appearance of independence from NASA management, and concluded that discipline
‘‘up to and including removal’’ was appropriate. After reading the report, Chairman
Gordon  and  I  and  Senator  Bill  Nelson,  the  Chair  of  the  counterpart  committee  in
the  Senate,  called  upon  President  Bush  to  remove  Mr.  Cobb  and  Inspector  General
of NASA.

Mr.  Cobb  serves  at  the  pleasure  of  the  President,  and  it  apparently  still  pleases

President Bush for Mr. Cobb to serve as the NASA Inspector General.

This  subcommittee  will  likely  hear  from  Mr.  Cobb  and  others  in  the  next  few
weeks  concerning  the  allegations  of  misconduct  that  were  the  subject  of  the  PCIE
report. As damning as the report was, it appears on closer examination that the re-
port was overly generous.

The subject of this hearing is the conduct of NASA officials in handling the Cobb

Specifically, this hearing concerns a meeting with the staff of the Office of Inspec-
tor General of NASA, a meeting all staff members were expected to attend, a meet-
ing at which Mr. Cobb sat beside Administrator Michael Griffin while Administrator
Griffin  disputed  the  findings  of  the  PCIE  report.  NASA  officials  certainly  should
have  known  that  such  a  meeting  would  only  further  the  appearance  of  a  lack  of
independence by the NASA Inspector General.

In  his  prepared  statement,  Michael  Wholly,  the  General  Counsel  at  NASA,  is  in
high  dudgeon  about  the  accounts  of  NASA  employees  who  attended  the  meeting,
which  he  testifies  ‘‘range  from  the  patently  false  to  the  ridiculous.’’  He  asserts  that
this  subcommittee  should  be  skeptical  of  ‘‘allegations  slipped  under  the  door  or
thrown  over  the  transom,  often  anonymously  or  with  the  request  for  anonymity.’’
That  is  exactly  how  whistle  blowers  provide  information  to  oversight  committees  of
Congress, and to Inspector Generals acting independently as required by statute.

We could have known for certain just exactly what happened at that meeting, and
not  had  to  decide  whose  wildly  conflicting  account  to  believe,  because  there  was  a
DVD made of the meeting, and then copies were made of the DVD. Mr. Wholly per-
sonally destroyed those tapes.

A  great  American  lawyer,  Elihu  Root,  said  that  ‘‘About  half  of  the  practice  of  a
decent  lawyer  is  telling  would-be  clients  that  they  are  damned  fools  and  should

school, and it remains the expectation set forth in the Code of Professional Respon-
sibility.  Instead,  the  view  within  NASA  apparently  was  the  DVDs  could  be  de-
stroyed absent advice that any legal arguments that the DVDs should be preserved
was ‘‘CATEGORICALLY, . . .FATALLY, LEGALLY, FLAWED.’’

I  worry  that  the  ethical  obligations  of  lawyers  that  I  learned  in  law  school  are

now regarded as quaint and antiquated, like the Geneva Convention.

NASA  officials,  Mr.  Wholly  and  Paul  Morrell,  knew  that  there  were  questions
about the propriety of the meeting, they knew that the Cobb matter was the subject

from that conduct.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
We  are  here  today,  in  part,  to  reconstruct  a  meeting  we  should
have  been  able  to  watch.  Congress  relies  on  Inspectors  General  as
agency  watchdogs  to  oversee  the  conduct  at  agencies.  And  let  me
say,  ten  years  ago,  when  I  was  the  Chairman  of  the  Full  Science
Committee,  I  used  Inspectors  General  very  effectively  in  doing  the
oversight  that  the  Constitution  and  the  public  demands  that  the
Congress do.

And even though I had a very contentious relationship with then
Administrator  Daniel  Goldin,  the  Inspector  General,  who  was  also
appointed  by  President  Clinton,  maintained  his  fierce  independ-
ence,  and  was  able  not  only  to  give  the  Committee  relevant  infor-
mation  on  matters  of  concern,  but  according  to  Mr.  Goldin,  these
efforts,  together  with  others  that  this  committee  did,  made  NASA
a better agency.

Now,  because  we  rely  on  Inspectors  General  so  heavily,  we  take
allegations against them seriously, and after a year-long investiga-
tion  and  deliberative  process,  in  which  Congress  was  kept  almost
entirely  in  the  dark,  the  President’s  Council  on  Integrity  and  Effi-
ciency,  the  PCIE  mentioned,  too,  by  the  Chairman,  forwarded  its
investigative  committee’s  findings  on  NASA’s  Inspector  General  to
Administrator Michael Griffin.

Administrator  Griffin,  in  concert  with  NASA’s  senior  manage-
ment,  reviewed  the  findings,  and  recommended  that  the  Inspector
General  attend  management  training  courses.  He  forwarded  his
recommendations to the Chairman of the PCIE, who adopted them.
Administrator  Griffin  then  scheduled  a  meeting  on  April  10  with
staff  from  the  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  to  explain  his  deci-
sion.

By several accounts, Administrator Griffin’s meeting on April 10,
with  the  Office  of  the  IG  further  undermined  the  IG’s  independ-
ence,  and  I  am  extremely  concerned  about  that.  As  one  NASA  em-
ployee  told  Committee  staff  after  attending  the  meeting,  if  there
was  an  appearance  of  independence  before,  there  is  none  now.
Given  our  reliance  on  Inspectors  General,  Congress  would  have
benefited from reviewing a tape of that meeting. It is therefore un-
fortunate  that  these  tapes  were  destroyed,  but  hopefully,  through
testimony today, we can develop an accurate picture of the meeting
as possible.

I  would  further  request  the  Chair,  and  I  will  be  happy  to  sign
a  letter  to  that  effect,  to  refer  this  matter  to  the  Justice  Depart-
ment for investigation, because I believe that this tape, which was
produced  by  a  NASA  employee  with  NASA  equipment,  is  govern-
ment property, and there are criminal penalties for the destruction
of government property.

But  perhaps  more  unfortunately,  we  need  to  know  why  record-
ings of that meeting were destroyed. I believe in open government,
and  I  am  very  concerned  to  hear  that  a  government  employee  was
beating  a  videocassette  with  a  plank  and  an  agency’s  General
Counsel  physically  destroyed  a  stack  of  DVDs.  The  fact  that  these
events  happened  at  different  locations  across  the  country,  and  the
fact  that  no  copies  of  the  recorded  meeting  remain,  suggest  a  co-
ordinated effort to destroy all record of the event.

This destruction also seems to have occurred with limited under-
standing of the applicable law, and under full awareness that Con-
gress  and  specifically,  this  subcommittee,  was  investigating  this
issue.  I  believe  that  personnel  decisions  within  the  Administration
should  be  handled  by  the  Administration,  and  as  such,  I  support
the  decisions  made  by  NASA,  the  PCIE,  and  the  President,  but
these decisions need to be made transparently, and they need to be
made  in  a  way  that  preserves  confidence  in  the  Office  of  Inspector
General and our agencies’ leadership.

From  the  information  that  this  subcommittee  has  received  to
date,  there  is  no  reason  to  give  us  any  confidence  whatsoever  in
how this matter was handled, and I hope that this hearing inspires
confidence,  and  will  be  able  to  restore  at  least  a  scintilla  of  faith
in what is going on at NASA headquarters.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER

We  are  here  today,  in  part,  to  reconstruct  a  meeting  that  we  should  have  been
able to watch. Congress relies on inspectors general as agency watchdogs to oversee
the conduct at agencies. As such, we take allegations against inspectors general se-
riously.  After  a  year-long  investigative  and  deliberative  process,  in  which  Congress
was kept almost entirely in the dark, the President’s Council on Integrity and Effi-
ciency (PCIE) forwarded its Investigative Committee’s findings on NASA’s Inspector
General to NASA’s Administrator, Michael Griffin. Administrator Griffin, in concert
with  NASA  senior  management,  reviewed  the  findings  and  recommended  that  the
Inspector  General  attend  management  training  courses.  He  forwarded  his  rec-
ommendations to the Chairman of the PCIE, who adopted them. Administrator Grif-
fin then scheduled a meeting on April 10 with staff from the Office of the Inspector
General to explain his decision.

By  several  accounts,  Administrator  Griffin’s  April  10  meeting  with  the  Office  of
the Inspector General further undermined the NASA Inspector General’s independ-
ence.  As  one  NASA  employee  told  Committee  staff  after  attending  the  meeting,  ‘‘If
there wasn’t an appearance of independence before, there is now.’’

Given our reliance on inspectors general, Congress would have benefited from re-
viewing  a  tape  of  that  meeting.  It  is  therefore  unfortunate  that  the  tapes  were  de-
stroyed,  but  hopefully,  through  testimony  today,  we  can  develop  as  accurate  a  pic-
ture of the meeting as possible.

Perhaps  more  unfortunately,  we  also  need  to  understand  why  recordings  of  that
meeting  were  destroyed.  I  believe  in  open  government  and  I  am  very  concerned  to
hear that a government employee was beating a videocassette with a plank and an
Agency’s General Counsel physically destroyed a stack of DVDs. The fact that these
events happened at different locations across the country and the fact that no copies
of  the  recorded  meeting  remain,  suggest  a  coordinated  effort  to  destroy  all  record
of  the  event.  This  destruction  also  seems  to  have  occurred  with  limited  under-
standing  of  the  applicable  law  and  under  full  awareness  that  Congress  was  inves-
tigating this issue.

I believe that personnel decisions within the Administration should be handled by
the Administration. As such, I support the decisions made by NASA, the PCIE, and
the  President.  But  those  decisions  need  to  be  made  transparently  and  they  need  to
be  made  in  a  way  that  preserves  confidence  in  the  Office  of  the  Inspector  General
and  in  our  agencies’  leadership.  Hopefully,  today’s  hearing  will  inspire  that  con-
fidence.

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Sensenbrenner.
Our first panel will not be providing written testimony or formal
opening  statements,  though  I  understand  that  you  may  be,  would
like to say something extemporaneously in a moment before we ac-
tually begin with our questions.

We  have  asked  both  of  them,  in  large  part,  to  discuss  the  April
10  meeting  that  is  at  issue  here,  between  Administrator  Griffin
and  the  staff  of  NASA’s  Office  of  the  Inspector  General.  In  re-

sponse,  the  response  of  the  staff  to  that  meeting,  and  the  destruc-
tion of the DVDs of the meeting.

Evelyn  Klemstine  is  the  Assistant  Deputy  Inspector  General  for
Audits  at  NASA.  Kevin  Winters  is  the  Assistant  Deputy  Inspector
General  for  Inspections.  In  a  senior  OIG,  Office  of  Inspector  Gen-
eral staff meeting on April 11, Ms. Klemstine brought the concerns
of  the  OIG  staff,  that  the  OIG  staff  had  raised  with  her  about  the
meeting,  and  subsequently,  drafted  a  memo  that  set  forth  those
concerns.

In  an  interview  with  the  Committee  staff,  Mr.  Winters  also  ex-
pressed  reservations  about  the  propriety  of  the  meeting,  and  said
that he was investigating the destruction of the DVD.

We  want  to  thank  both  of  you  for  being  here.  It  is  the  practice
of the Subcommittee to take testimony under oath. Do either of you
have any objections to being sworn in?

Mr. WINTERS. No, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  You  also  have  the  right  to  be  rep-
resented  by  Counsel.  Are  either  of  you  represented  by  Counsel
today?

Mr. WINTERS. No, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman MILLER. All right. If you would please stand and raise

your right hand.

[Witnesses sworn]
Chairman  MILLER.  Two  quick  matters.  One  is  before  we  begin,
I would like to place into the exhibit of this hearing a record of ex-
hibits. That has been provided to Mr. Sensenbrenner, to the Minor-
ity  staff  as  well,  and  is,  I  believe,  on  the  table  for  your  reference,
for  the  witnesses,  reference  by  the  witnesses.  And  without  objec-
tion,  it  is  so  ordered.  [The  information  appears  in  the  Appendix.]
And  then,  second,  I  know  that  neither  of  you  were  asked,  we
didn’t ask either one of you to provide a written statement, but ei-
ther  of  you  wish  to  make  any  preliminary  statement  before  we
begin?

Mr. WINTERS. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Winters.

Mr. WINTERS. My name is Kevin Winters. I am the Assistant In-

General.

With the Chairman’s permission, we would like to provide a brief
opening statement. Our intent is to provide what we hope is a help-
ful  context  regarding  the  organizations  for  which  Ms.  Klemstine
and myself are responsible.

As  the  Chairman  knows,  the  mission  of  the  Office  of  Inspector
General  is  to  conduct  objective  oversight  of  NASA’s  programs  and

operations, and then, to independently report to the NASA Admin-
istrator,  this  Congress,  and  to  the  public,  to  further  help  NASA’s
accomplishment of its mission.

Public  Law  95–452,  commonly  known  as  the  Inspector  General
Act  of  1978,  is  the  statutory  basis  for  Offices  of  Inspector  General
throughout 61 federal agencies, and accordingly serves as our stat-
utory foundation for a series of broad mandates.

One  such  mandate  under  the  Act  is  that  the  Office  of  Inspector
General perform the following two operational functions: one being
audits, the second being investigations. The Office of Audits, super-
vised by Ms. Klemstine to my right, focuses on the conduct of audit
activities  relating  to  NASA’s  programs  and  operations.  There  are
101 NASA OIG employees in the Office of Audits, who are deployed
throughout most of NASA’s field centers. Ms. Klemstine, as the As-
sistant  Inspector  General  for  Audits,  is  a  28-year  career  civil  serv-
ant,  largely  in  the  IG  community,  and  has  been  with  NASA  OIG
since November 2004.

I  am  privileged  to  lead  the  other  operational  function,  the  Office
of  Investigations,  which  performs  investigative  activities  both
criminal  and  administrative,  pertaining  to  NASA’s  programs  and
operations.

There  are  81  NASA  OIG  employees  in  the  Office  of  Investiga-
tions,  of  which  58  are  federal  law  enforcement  officers  who  serve
as  special  agents.  Like  their  audit  counterparts,  our  investigative
staff is deployed throughout most of NASA’s field centers.

As  the  Assistant  Inspector  General  for  Investigations,  I  am  rel-
atively  new  to  the  Inspector  General  community,  having  served  in
NASA  OIG  for  17  months.  Before  that,  I  served  30  years  of  uni-
formed service in the U.S. Marine Corps. Like Ms. Klemstine, I am
now a civil servant.

Finally,  we  are  responsible  for  our  respective  functions  to  NASA
Inspector  General,  the  Honorable  Robert  Cobb.  As  the  Chairman
mentioned,  Mr.  Cobb  was  nominated  by  the  President  as  NASA’s
Inspector  General,  on  February  26,  2002,  and  confirmed  by  the
U.S. Senate on April 11, 2002.

We  are  here  today  at  your  invitation,  and  we  look  forward  to

your questions.

DISCUSSION

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Winters. That was one of the
better  opening  statements  I  have  heard,  certainly  from  a  witness
that we didn’t ask to prepare an opening statement. If all witnesses
that  we  didn’t  ask  to  prepare  an  opening  statement  gave  one  like
that, we would not ask more often.

At  this  point,  I  will  recognize  myself  for  five  minutes,  and  Mr.
Sensenbrenner for five minutes. If any other Members attend, they
will  be  entitled  to  five  minutes  of  questioning  as  well.  We  will  ro-
tate back and forth until we have completed the questions that we
have of you.

APRIL 10, 2007 MEETING

Mr.  Winters  and  Ms.  Klemstine,  you  did  both  hear  of  the  all-
hands meeting on April 10. How did that e-mail, how did you hear
of that meeting?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  I  received  an  e-mail  from  the  Deputy  Inspector
General,  stating  that  there  would  be  a  meeting  on  April  10  that
was mandatory for all staff members.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Mr. Winters.
Mr. WINTERS. The same thing, it was an e-mail on April 9, which
I  believe  was  a  Monday,  late  in  the  day,  I  want  to  say  about  5:00,
from the Deputy.

Chairman MILLER. And the Deputy was Tom Howard.
Mr. WINTERS. It was Mr. Tom Howard.
Chairman MILLER. All right. Thank you.
If  employees  cannot  attend  all-hands  meetings,  meetings  at
which  every  member  of  the  staff  is  expected  to  attend,  has  it  been
the  practice  to  have  a  recording  of  that  meeting  for  those  employ-
ees, and is it reasonable to do so?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes. Every all-hands meeting I have been to, as
well  as  some  ethics  training,  and  other  meetings  where  everybody
is required to go to, have always been videotaped.

Mr. WINTERS. Yes. I think it is a reasonable idea that people can
come  back  and  look  at  a  tape.  In  this  case,  I  don’t  have  a  recollec-
tion  that  it  was  mandatory  to  go  back  and  look  at  a  tape,  though.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Mr. Winters, you told us, our staff, that
Mr.  Cobb,  Mr.  Howard,  Ms.  Klemstine,  and  you  were  in  the  meet-
ing  room  when  the  Administrator,  Mr.  Griffin,  came  in,  and  Mr.
Morrell and Mr. Wholley.

You said to our staff that was tension in the room. What was the
nature  of  the  tension?  Could  you  describe  the  atmosphere  in  the
room?

Mr. WINTERS. It was a room in the basement of the NASA Head-
quarters  building,  tiered  seating.  All  the  NASA  OIG  employees
were  present  in  the  room,  who  worked  in  the  Headquarters  build-
ing,  and  to  our  front  were  the  nine  respective  NASA  field  centers
displayed up on the screen.

The  purpose  of  the  meeting  was  generally  known,  that  the  Ad-
ministrator was going to discuss, more or less, his review and find-
ings, or it was assumed that he was going to discuss his review and
findings  of  the  PCIE  investigation.  So,  there  was  a  natural,  in  my
opinion, tension that the Administrator was going to discuss allega-
tions of misconduct of our boss. So, it was quite reasonable to have
a feeling of tension about that, with our boss present.

Chairman  MILLER.  Sure.  Mr.  Winters,  you  told  our  staff,  our
Subcommittee  staff,  that  you  knew  instinctively  that  this  meeting
was  a  mistake,  that  it  gave  a  perception  of  a  lack  of  independence
of the Inspector General. Is that your testimony today as well?

Mr. WINTERS. That might be a bit of an overstatement, but in my
opinion,  it  was  and  is  difficult  to  have  that  type  of  a  discussion
with your boss present.

Chairman MILLER. So, it was the appearance—well, you told the
staff  that  there  were  visuals  that  raised  questions  by  you  and  by
other members of the staff. What did you mean by that?

Mr.  WINTERS.  The  optics  of  the  head  of  the  NASA,  the  Adminis-
trator,  reviewing  a  report  of  allegations  in  front  of  the  Inspector
General, and speaking to the staff about it. The optics of just those
people  in  the  same  room  together,  talking  about  this  particular
subject.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  So,  in  Washington,  we  would  say  that
there was a problem with the optics outside of the beltway, and the
rest of America would say it looked bad?

Mr.  WINTERS.  I  think  that  might  be  an  overstatement,  Mr.

Chairman, but the optics did raise issues, obviously.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Ms.  Klemstine,  do  you  think  it  was  a
bad  idea?  Did  you  think  so  at  the  time,  and  do  you  think  so  now,
to have the meeting with Mr. Cobb present?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  I  definitely  felt  that  Mr.  Cobb  should  not  be
there.  I  was  surprised  that  he  was  at  the  meeting.  I  had  not  had
that expectation.

However,  what  I  was  looking  for  at  that  meeting  was  basically,
‘‘a  pep  talk.’’  I  felt  like  our  organization  needed  somebody  to  come
in  and  tell  us  that  we  were  valuable  to  the  organization,  that  we
provided some input, and that was what I was looking for.

So,  I  wasn’t  opposed  to  having  the  meeting,  but  I  didn’t  agree

with the content of the meeting.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Ms. Klemstine, did your senior staff ex-

press any kind of concern to you about the meeting?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Not prior to the meeting, but after the meeting.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. What was the nature of their concern?
Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Some  of  the  comments  made  by  the  Adminis-

trator as they related to the audit community.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  I  am  going  to  go  over  my  time  just
very  briefly.  I  am  going  to  refer  to  a  memo  dated  April  23,  2007.
That is Exhibit 1 in the book in front of you. Could you tell us what
that document is?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes. It is an e-mail that I prepared for the Dep-
uty Inspector General. The day after the Administrator had spoken
with  us,  Wednesday,  we  had  our  senior  staff  meeting,  as  we  do
every  Wednesday,  and  at  the  senior  staff  meeting,  I  expressed  at
the  meeting  that  my  staff  had  concerns  about  some  of  the  content
of  the  ViTS.  At  that  time,  I  was  told  to  basically  document  those
concerns, and this is the result of that documentation.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. And the concerns were that it was not

appropriate for Mr. Cobb to be at the meeting?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Chairman  MILLER.  And  certainly  not  if  Mr.  Griffin  expected  an

open discussion of the staff. Is that——
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes, that is correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  And  did  Mr.  Cobb  ever  address  the  appear-
ance,  the  issue  of  the  appearance  of  a  lack  of  independence,  and
what would be done to correct that appearance?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. At the meeting itself?
Chairman  MILLER.  Did  I  say  Mr.  Cobb?  I  meant,  Mr.  Griffin  is

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Oh.  Did  he  address—I  am  not  quite  sure  I  un-

what I meant to say.

derstand the question.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  sorry.  It  was  one  of  the  concerns  that
your  staff  expressed,  was  that  Mr.  Griffin  never  addressed  the
principal concern of the PCIE report, that Mr. Cobb failed to main-
tain the appearance of independence.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes, that was one of their concerns.
Chairman MILLER. That Mr. Griffin never addressed that——
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Chairman  MILLER.  That  concern.  Okay.  And  the—and  did  Ad-

ministrator Griffin also express, describe the work of the OIG?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  He  described  the  work  in  terms  of  what  it  was
that  he  thought  we  ought  to  be  concentrating  on,  or  areas  that  he
thought  that  we  should  do,  such  as  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,  and
other areas where he didn’t think that we added value to the com-
munity.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  And  did  your  staff  express  to  you
how they regarded Mr. Griffin’s statement? Did they find them dis-
heartening?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes. Several people were quite upset about some

of the comments.

Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Especially my technical staff.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. And did Mr. Griffin make any, say any-

thing about the technical expertise of the staff?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Yeah,  he  basically  said  that  the  audit  commu-
nity  didn’t  have  the  ability  to  make  technical  type,  I  don’t  want  to
say  decisions,  but  recommendations,  I  guess  would  be  the  correct
word. Those weren’t his exact words, but in generality.

Chairman  MILLER.  So,  okay,  the  staff  lacked  the  technical  com-

petence to make them.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Right, exactly, that you know, he had engineers
and technical people on his staff that were more technically knowl-
edgeable  than  those  that  would  be  on  an  audit  staff,  even  though
I  do  have  engineers,  as  well  as  software  engineers,  as  part  of  my
staff.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  So,  this  is,  expecting  a  pep  talk,  you

got something very different.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. That was my expectation, yes. I was looking for,
because  I  have  been  there  for  two  and  a  half  years,  and  we  have
been under this cloud, and I really wanted, not only for myself but
for my staff, some feeling of adding value to the organization.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Mr. Sensenbrenner.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I  would  kind  of  like  to  go  on  the  broader  issues.  Do  you  think
the  impression  that  was  given  by  Administrator  Griffin’s  talk  to
the IG staff was appropriate?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. And why?
Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Again,  as  I  stated  earlier,  I  really  felt  that  he
did owe us some type of pep thing, but I didn’t think that he should
go  as  far  as  making  comments  about  the  fact  that,  you  know,  if  it
wasn’t a billion dollars worth of savings, it wasn’t worth reviewing,
that  we  didn’t  have  the  technical  expertise  to  do  certain  types  of
jobs, and that our jobs should be basically focused on fraud, waste,
and abuse.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  You  think  that  Administrator  Griffin’s
comments  undermined  the  independence  of  the  IG  staff?  Either  of
you.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. I think that would be an individual to individual
comment.  Personally,  it  did  not  undermine  my  independence,  be-
cause I have been in this community a long time, and I know that
people make comments specifically on the audit side. But I do know
that  many  of  my  staff  members  did  feel  undermined  by  his  com-
ments.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Now, did Administrator Griffin make these
comments  in  response  to  a  question,  or  was  this  just  something
that  he  said  on  his  own,  and  not  in  response  to  any  questions  by
the audience?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  It  was  in  response  to  a  question  from  the  audi-

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Okay.  And  what  was—if  you  can  recall,

what was the nature of that question?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  The  nature  of  the  question,  that  was  actually
from,  not  somebody  from  the  audit  community,  was  specifically
what type of audits do you think we should be doing?

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  And  that  question,  which  came  from  out-
side the audit community, and the answer of Administrator Griffin,
in  your  opinion,  did  it  undermine  the  independence  of  the  audit
community to be able to do its job?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Again,  I  am  not  sure  it  undermines.  It  does

ence.

are.

leave an impression.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. I mean, we are going to do what we need to do,
but it does leave the, what is the value, if the Administrator is not
interested in our work, then how are we contributing?

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Well,  he  might  not  be  interested,  but  we

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Right.  And  I—right,  granted.  And  that  is  why
it doesn’t undermine, because obviously, you are preponderant cus-
tomer, so you know, that is, it is just one part of the equation.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Not  only  the  customer,  but  the  sugar

daddy that gives you money every year, too.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Right.
Mr. WINTERS. Mr. Sensenbrenner, may I——
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Yeah.
Mr. WINTERS.—put you back on that line of questioning?
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Yeah.
Mr.  WINTERS.  The  Administrator  was  very  careful,  in  terms  of
his prepared remarks, and I think this committee has a copy of the
prepared remarks. He actually worked from a list of talking points,
in terms of what he wanted to communicate with our staff.

And the comments that Ms. Klemstine is referring to were in re-
sponse,  of  course,  to  questions,  and  it  was  my  impression,  again,
we are in the world of perceptions and how you view evidence and
how  you  view  statements,  that  the  Administrator  was  very  careful
in  qualifying  his  remarks,  because  he  was  being  asked  as  to  his
opinions,  as  to  what  mattered  to  him,  in  terms  of  our  work—as  to
the priority and to the type of work that we are doing.

And  he  went  on  at  great  length  that  he  valued  very  much  the
fraud,  waste,  and  abuse  type  investigations  that  we  do.  And  then,
he  went  into  his  opinions  as  to  management-type  recommenda-
tions,  which  he  hears,  apparently,  you  know,  according  to  him,
every  day.  In  terms  of  winners  and  losers  on  decisions  that  are
made, it was my impression that he was saying that management-
type  recommendations  are  not  as  helpful  to  him,  in  terms  of  the
work  the  OIG  does,  as  compared  to  the  typical  criminal  fraud,
waste, and abuse investigations.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  When  did  you  first  learn  that  the  meeting

was recorded? Both of you.

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  It  was  on  the  screen  there.  There  were  several

signs in the room that said that this is being recorded.

Mr. WINTERS. That is true.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  And  when  did  you  first  learn  that  the

meeting should not have been recorded?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. I never heard that the meeting should not have
been  recorded.  What  I  did  hear  was  the  following  morning,  I  re-
ceived an e-mail from one of my staff members telling me that they
were  told  to  destroy  the  tapes,  and  that  was  my  first  knowledge
that there was any type of concept of tape destruction.

Mr.  WINTERS.  I  first  learned  on  Monday.  Monday,  I  think  it  is
the  16th  or  17th  of  April.  I  might  have  my  dates  wrong  on  that.
It was after the weekend. The meeting occurred on April the 10th,
which I believe was a Tuesday. I had some evidence that employees
were asking for the tapes on that Friday, the following Friday.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Are  these  types  of  meetings  usually  re-

corded?

Mr. WINTERS. Yes.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Both of you say yes?
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Mr.  WINTERS.  And  they  are  fairly  rare,  Mr.  Sensenbrenner,  in

terms of——

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. All right.
Mr.  WINTERS.—all-hands  meetings.  This  is  the  first  all-hands
meeting that we ever had with the Administrator since I have been
there.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  If  I  can  run  over  my  time  a  little  bit,  too.
Have  either  of  you  ever  requested  that  a  meeting  of  this  type  be
recorded?

Mr. WINTERS. No.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Sensenbrenner, I ran over three minutes.
You could have gone another couple minutes if you had wanted to.
To  follow  up  on  that  last  question,  have  either  of  you  requested

that a meeting not be recorded?

Mr. WINTERS. No.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  Winters,  you  referred  to  Administrator  Griffin’s  opening
statement being in writing. We actually do not have a copy of that.
It  is  hard  to  imagine  our  request  would  not  have  included,  would

me.

not have reached a copy of that prepared statement, but can we re-
ceive that from you?

Mr.  WINTERS.  Well,  we  certainly  have  access  to  all  NASA  docu-

ments, and we will make a request to get that.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Right.
Mr. WINTERS. I am sorry—is that——
Chairman MILLER. You can answer this question quickly, excuse

Mr. WINTERS. We can request a document for you.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  I  neglected  to  notice  that  Mr.  Feeney
was here, and he is entitled to five minutes of questioning as well.
Mr. Feeney.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. If now is the appro-
priate time, I probably won’t have five minutes worth, but for both
of  the  witnesses,  my  understanding  is  that  your  Office  is  to  func-
tion  totally  independent  of  the  Administrator’s  supervision  or  con-
trol. Is that right?

Mr. WINTERS. Under the IG Act, we are under what is called the
general supervision of the head of the agency, which is a term that
is often debated in the periodicals.

Yes, we are independent, in terms of——
Mr. FEENEY. Your mission is to be independent.
Mr.  WINTERS.—what  we  decide  to  investigate  or  audit,  and

things like that.

Mr.  FEENEY.  And  so,  for  example,  if  the  Administrator  told  you
not  to  investigate  abuse,  waste,  or  fraud,  you  would  have  been  re-
quired to ignore those instructions?

Mr. WINTERS. Correct. We make our independent assessments as

to what to do.

Mr. FEENEY. In his original letter calling the meeting, Mr. Griffin
said  that  he  had  reviewed  the  ROI,  and  I  have  taken  actions  that
I  believe  are  necessary  to  address  the  ROI’s  findings.  Did  he  ex-
press that in his statement that we don’t have a copy of?

Mr.  WINTERS.  Yes,  he  did.  I  don’t  know  what  was  on  the  state-
ment. I presume—it was a written statement one page, and he had
some talking points, which he appeared to have, he read from these
talking  points,  in  terms  of  why  we  are  at  the  meeting  that  he  has
been,  that  he  was  requested  to  provide  input  to  the  Chair  of  the
PCIE, and he went through the chronology as to how we got to this
particular  place  that  he  reviewed  the  investigation,  and  that  he  is
making the following recommendations.

Mr. FEENEY. Other than saying that with respect to the technical
expertise  in  running  the  agency,  he  felt  like  he  had  people  more
suitable  and  qualified.  Did  he,  in  general,  give  support  to  your  Of-
fice, in terms of your mission, and in general, express sympathy or
empathy with the jobs that you had, and support for what you do?
Mr.  WINTERS.  Well,  we  represent  two  separate  functions  of  the
Office of Inspector General. From my functional area, the Office of
Investigations,  my  staff  was  supportive  of  him,  stating  essentially
‘‘good  for  the  Administrator’’  that  he  is  all  about  finding  out  about
fraud, waste, and abuse, and supports us.

Mr. FEENEY. And Ms. Klemstine.
Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  My  staff’s  perspective,  not  as  glowing.  There
were  concerns  about,  especially  since  I  do  have  two  groups  that

specifically  lean  towards  a  technical  area,  both  my  Science  and
Aeronautics  Research  Group,  as  well  as  my  Space  Operation  and
Exploration Group. And they do more technical type audits, as well
as make technical recommendations.

So, there was some concern, specifically in those two areas.
Mr. FEENEY. And these concerns were expressed to you after the

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Mr. FEENEY. Were they expressed during the meeting to the Ad-

meeting?

ministrator?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Mr.  FEENEY.  And  was  there  a  reason  that  they  were  not  ex-

pressed during the meeting?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  No,  I  can’t  answer  that  question.  I  have  not
asked  that  question,  nor  do  I  know  any  reason  why  it  was  not  ex-
pressed.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Did  anybody  express  at  the  time  that  they  felt  it
was inappropriate for Mr. Cobb to be in attendance at the meeting?
During the meeting, did anybody tell the Administrator they would
be more comfortable——

Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Mr. FEENEY. Okay. I have no further questions.
Chairman MILLER. Thank you.

DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

DVDs?

Ms.  Klemstine,  we  spoke  for  a  moment  about  how  both  you  and
Mr.  Winters  first  heard  that  the  tapes  were  being  destroyed.  And
I  think  you  said  you  had  gotten  e-mails,  I  think  according  to  your
interviews with our staff, Karen VanSant was involved in an e-mail
exchange. Catherine——

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Actually,  it  was  Susan  Aggen,  who  mentioned
Karen VanSant. She was the one who actually had sent the e-mail,
that Karen had been told to.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  All  right.  And  then,  Catherine

Schneiter——

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Schneiter, yes.
Chairman MILLER. Schneiter?
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  what  did  she  tell  you  about  the

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Well,  the  first,  and  I  believe  that  you  have  a
copy  of  that,  was  an  e-mail  that  she  sent  to  me,  saying  that  they
had  asked  for  the  destruction  of  the  tapes,  and  I  wrote  an  e-mail
back  in  response,  saying  why  are  we  doing  this?  And  then,  I  went
actually  down  to  physically  talk  to  her,  as  to  why  was  this  occur-
ring, because in my mind, it sent up a bunch of red flags, as to why
would we destroy tapes.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  You  mentioned  e-mails.  Exhibit  5,  in
the  exhibit  book  before  you,  are  those  e-mails  that  you  have  re-
ferred to?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. No, this one comes from Dave Gandrud to Cath-

erine. It was a different e-mail.

Chairman MILLER. I have got the wrong number. Exhibit 2.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.

time?

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Did  you  consider  telling  Ms.

VanSant or Ms. Schneiter not to destroy——

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Chairman MILLER.—the tapes?
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Very much so. I did.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. You considered it. Did you do it?
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No, I did not do it.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  And  I  did  not  do  it  because  I  was  not  the  origi-

nator of the document.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Do you feel any twinge of regret in——
Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Chairman MILLER.—that decision?
Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  Yes,  I  remember  sitting  at  my  desk  when  I  got
this e-mail, and I was, I remember thinking jeez, we should not be
doing  this.  You  know,  the  price  to  pay  for  destroying  a  document
versus what was on the document to me wasn’t worth the expendi-
ture, and I did go and talk to Catherine about can’t we try to keep
it or whatever, and I did discuss it at my level, but I did not pursue
it any higher than my level.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Did you discuss this with Mr. Winters?
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No, he was not there at the time.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Did  you  discuss  him  with  it  at  any

Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Did——
Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  You  have  to  realize  that  the  tapes  were  de-
stroyed  the  following  morning,  like  8:00  or  9:00  in  the  morning.  It
was so quick, it was done within less than 24 hours.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Did  you  hear  Mr.  Winters,  at  any
time,  tell  the  staff  of  the  OIG  office  that  destroying  something  al-
ways  raises  red  flags?  You  used  the  phrase  raises  red  flags  a  mo-
ment ago.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Did I hear Mr. Winters make that comment?
Chairman MILLER. Right.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. No, I did not. That was——
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Mr.  Winters,  what  was  your  response

when you heard of the order to destroy tapes, the DVDs?

Mr.  WINTERS.  The  chronology  of  getting  there  was,  might  be
helpful to the Chairman. The first time I heard that the tapes were
destroyed  was  the  following  week,  when  I  talked  to  the  Chief  of
Staff of NASA.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Did  you  tell  your  staff  at  any  point

that destroying something always raises red flags?

Mr. WINTERS. I might have.
Chairman MILLER. Well——
Mr. WINTERS. It is a reasonable statement to make, and one that

I would hold today.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Whether  you  said  it  or  not,  you

thought it then, you think it now?

Mr. WINTERS. Correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Mr.  Winters,  did  you  begin  an  inves-

tigation of any kind into the destruction of the——

Mr. WINTERS. Yes.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. When did you do that?
Mr. WINTERS. Well, upon learning that the tapes were destroyed,
and  I  went  back  and  talked  to  my  leadership,  as  to  next  steps,  in
terms of what to do.

Chairman MILLER. Who were your leadership?
Mr.  WINTERS.  The  Deputy  Inspector  General,  Mr.  Tom  Howard.
Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Winters,  I  know  that  you  are  a  lawyer.
Are  you  familiar  with  the  evidentiary  concept  of  spoilation,  s-p-o-
i-l-a-t-i-o-n.

Mr.  WINTERS.  Probably  not  as  much  as  I  should,  but  maybe  the

Chairman could share that with me.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  let  the  word  go  forth  that  any  lawyer
who  appears  before  this  committee  should  be  expected  to  be
quizzed  about  the  law.  Is  there  any  element  of  what  you  under-
stand  of  spoliation  to  mean,  that  when  a  party,  knowing  that  evi-
dence will be of interest to another party, because of pending litiga-
tion  or  anticipated  litigation,  or  the  interest  of  an  oversight  com-
mittee, destroys a document that would be of interest, that the in-
ference  about  what  was  in  the  document  is  damning  to  the  person
who destroyed it? Is that your understanding of——

Mr. WINTERS. I agree with that.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Is there any element of spoliation that

does not fit these circumstances?

Mr. WINTERS. There is not.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Sensenbrenner.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Thank  you.  For  either  of  you,  were  OIG

employees looking for copies of the destroyed tapes?

Mr. WINTERS. It is my understanding there were some employees
that  missed  the  meeting,  and  were  looking  for  the  tapes,  so  they
could view the meeting themselves.

Ms. KLEMSTINE. Yes.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. What was your reaction, when you received

the e-mail asking that copies of the tape be destroyed?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. I think that question applies to me. I, as I stated
earlier,  when  I  was  sitting  at  my  desk  reading  that  e-mail,  my
thought  was  why  are  we  doing  this?  This  is  not  the  right  thing  to
do. So, as I said, red flags went up in my head.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  When  the  red  flags  went  up,  did  you  do

anything in response to those flags?

Ms.  KLEMSTINE.  I  went  back  to  the  originator  of  the  e-mail,  Ms.
Schneider,  and  asked  her  specifically  what  is  the  story  here?  Why
are we doing this? Again, the e-mail actually came out of Marshall,
which is one of our field centers, where I first obtained the knowl-
edge  that  this  was  going  on.  I  was  not  familiar  with  the  head-
quarters  situation  at  all,  and  I  was  basically  told  that  there  was
somebody  standing  there  waiting  to  take  the  tape  from  the  ViTS
office, and that basically, they had already given the individual the
ViTS tape.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Ms.  Klemstine,  you  have  been  in  the  IG’s
office  for  a  long  time.  Have  you  ever  received  a  request  like  this?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. No.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  And  why  do  you  think  the  NASA  head-

quarters wanted those tapes destroyed?

Ms. KLEMSTINE. I truly do not know why. Again, the price of de-
stroying those tapes was not worth, in my mind, what was on those
tapes. And so, I cannot think why we would do that.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Winters.
Mr. WINTERS. I can only speculate.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. And who do you think was behind the deci-

sion?

Mr. WINTERS. To destroy it?
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Yes.
Mr.  WINTERS.  The  combination  of  either  the  Chief  of  Staff  and

the General Counsel.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Ms. Klemstine.
Ms. KLEMSTINE. I would say the same. I have no knowledge.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  I  have  no  further  questions.  We  will  be

hearing from them in a few minutes.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Feeney.
Mr. FEENEY. I have no further questions. Thanks.
Chairman  MILLER.  I  am  sure  that  you  will  be  disappointed  that
that is the end of our questions for you. And if we could take a re-
cess of just a couple of minutes, we will have our next panel.

Thank you.
[Recess.]
Chairman MILLER. The Subcommittee will return to order.
And  we  now  welcome  our  second  panel,  Michael  Wholley,  the
General  Counsel  of  NASA,  and  Paul  Morrell,  the  Chief  of  Staff  for
NASA Administrator Michael Griffin.

It is, as you know, the practice of the Subcommittee to take testi-
mony  under  oath.  Do  any,  do  either  of  you  have  any  objection  to
being sworn in?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. You also have a right to be represented

by Counsel. Are you represented by Counsel today?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir.
Chairman MILLER. If you would now please stand and raise your

[Witnesses sworn]
Chairman MILLER. Thank you.
Both of you have provided written testimony, and I believe, I as-
sume that your oral testimony will be very similar to that, probably
simply reading that.

If  you  could  begin  with  limiting  that  testimony  to  five  minutes,
all of your written testimony will be placed in the record, and after
that, we will ask questions in turn, as we did before.

We will begin with Mr. Wholley. Mr. Wholley.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MICHAEL  C.  WHOLLEY,  GENERAL  COUN-
SEL,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  ADMINISTRA-
TION (NASA)
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Sensenbrenner,

I  have  been  asked  to  address  five  issues  in  my  testimony  today
before  the  Subcommittee.  As  you  may  be  aware,  I  met  with  the

Mr. Feeney.

staff  of  the  Subcommittee,  as  well  as  with  the  staff  of  other  com-
mittees  on  April  27,  for  approximately  three  hours,  and  addressed
these five issues, as well as others, and answered to the best of my
recollection and belief all of the questions posed to me.

You  have  asked  me  to  address  the  April  10  meeting  held  by  Dr.
Griffin. Dr. Griffin set out as his purpose for that meeting what he
put in his March 14 letter: ‘‘I will schedule a meeting,’’ quoting Dr.
Griffin,  ‘‘with  the  employees  of  the  NASA  Office  of  Inspector  Gen-
eral,  to  inform  them  that  I  have  reviewed  the  Record  of  Investiga-
tion  (ROI),  and  I  have  taken  the  actions  that  I  believe  are  nec-
essary  to  address  the  ROI’s  findings.  Such  a  meeting  will  provide
me  an  opportunity  to  listen  to  any  concerns  that  may  exist  among
the  staff,  and  to  express  my  support,’’  that  would  be  Dr.  Griffin,
‘‘for a strong and effective Office of Inspector General.’’

I was in attendance at the meeting, arriving with Dr. Griffin and
Mr. Morrell, the Chief of Staff. The meeting was held in the video-
conference room on the lower level at NASA, and Dr. Griffin spoke
initially for approximately ten minutes. He stated, as best I recall,
something  similar  to  what  he  had  set  forth  in  his  letter  to  Mr.
Johnson,  with  respect  to  the  ROI,  having  revealed  no  evidence  of
a lack of integrity on the part of Mr. Cobb, nor did the ROI indicate
any actual conflict of interest, or actual lack of independence on his
part.

I  had  watched  Dr.  Griffin’s  interview  on  the  C–SPAN  program
Newsmakers  on  Sunday,  April  8,  which  is  still  online,  and  his  re-
marks at this meeting were similar to those he articulated on that
program.  Dr.  Griffin  then  opened  up  the  floor  for  questions,  and
several  questions  were  asked  and  answered.  I  believe  that  the
meeting lasted a total of approximately 30 minutes.

With  respect  to  the  subsequent  collection  and  destruction  of  all
video records of Administrator Griffin’s meeting with the OIG staff,
my  involvement  is  as  follows.  At  some  point  on  the  morning  after
the meeting, Paul Morrell came into my office. This was not an un-
usual occurrence. He had what turned out to be several DVDs, and
he sat at a table across from my desk.

He  appeared  upset  that  in  spite  of  his  direction  to  the  contrary
that  this  closed  meeting  was  not  to  be  recorded,  the  meeting  had
been  recorded.  As  best  I  recall,  he  stated  that  someone  in  Public
Affairs  had  asked  that  the  meeting  be  recorded,  and  had  then
asked that a number of copies me made.

Mr. Morrell indicated that he had recovered the copies from Pub-
lic  Affairs,  and  that  this  meeting  was  not  a  Public  Affairs  event,
but  rather,  a  closed  meeting  called  by  the  Administrator,  for  the
purpose that the Administrator set forth in his letter.

I believe I told him I clearly understood his pique that his direc-
tion  had  been  overridden,  and  that  this  closed  meeting  had  been
recorded, and that copies had been made. I believe that at the con-
clusion  of  our  discussion,  I  asked  him  to  leave  the  recordings  with
me, and I put them on my desk.

I  want  to  categorically  state  at  no  time  and  in  no  way  did  Mr.
Morrell indicate to me that I should destroy these recordings. That
did  not  happen.  Sometime  either  later  that  day,  or  early  the  next
day,  I  honestly  can’t  recall  when,  I  reviewed  relevant  portions  of

23

the  Federal  Records  Act  (FRA),  and  in  particular,  the  definition  of
what constituted a record.

I  also  briefly  reviewed  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act.  I  con-
cluded  that  these  copies  made  by  Public  Affairs  were  not  records
for  purposes  of  the  FRA,  but  also  concluded  that  if  they  were  re-
tained and filed, they could become records by virtue of that reten-
tion.  From  my  perspective,  and  I  stated  it  to  the  Subcommittee
staff,  I  did  not  believe  it  wise  to  have  these  in  any  way  become
records, subject to release under FOIA. This was a closed meeting,
specifically  directed  to  not  be  recorded,  and  these  DVDs  were  not
agency records at that time, in my opinion.

I  personally  made  the  decision  to  destroy  them,  and  I  did  so  by
breaking  them  into  pieces  and  throwing  them  in  the  trash.  The
next time I heard anything about these recordings was while I was
on vacation in Florida the week of April 15 at a family reunion. In
looking at my e-mails, I believe I first learned of the request to pro-
vide a copy of the recording to this subcommittee some time in the
late  afternoon  or  the  early  evening  of  April  18,  when  I  learned  of
the  Subcommittee’s  letter  of  the  same  date.  I  informed  my  staff  I
didn’t  have  any  copies  of  the  recording,  and  that  I  had  previously
destroyed  them.  At  some  later  time,  I  learned  that  there  had  been
other recordings made at other ViTS locations.

Regarding  my  role  in  the  response  by  Dr.  Griffin  to  the  report
of  the  Integrity  Committee,  I  became  aware  that  something  had
been sent to Dr. Griffin from Mr. Johnson in his role as Chairman
of the PCIE. I will try and skip forward to stay within my five min-
utes,  sir.  I  think  I  received  this  from  Mr.  Morrell  on  Monday  the
26th.  He  gave  me  what  had  been  delivered  to  Dr.  Griffin.  I  asked
my executive assistant to print all the documents out from the CD
that was provided, and I made arrangements to meet with Dr. Grif-
fin and discuss how he wanted this handled.

He  indicated  that  he  wanted  the  matter  reviewed,  and  that  he
wanted to know the full range of options open to him. Specifically,
I  might  add,  he  said  I  do  not  want  a  recommendation.  I  want  to
know what my options are.

At  some  point,  either  the  27th  or  28th,  I  discussed  it  with  my
Deputy.  I  discussed  the  possibility  of  having  a  newly  hired  indi-
vidual,  an  experienced  attorney  who  was  due  to  begin  working  in
my  office  the  following  Monday,  look  over  the  report  and  provide
me  her  unvarnished  opinion.  I  believed  this  was  a  good  option,  in
light  of  her  extensive  experience,  and  the  fact  that  so  far  as  I  was
aware,  she  knew  nothing  about  any  of  the  matters  or  the  parties
involved.

I  asked  Mr.  Sefton  to  call  her,  and  confirm  that  she  knew  noth-
ing  about  the  case,  and  asked  her  if  she  could  begin  working  on  it
at  the  earliest  opportunity,  in  light  of  the  tight  deadline  that  we
were  facing.  I  concurrently  reviewed  the  materials.  At  the  conclu-
sion of her review, she provided me her opinion.

I  arranged  for  a  meeting  to  brief  Dr.  Griffin,  and  had  her,  the
newly hired attorney, brief him on her review. At the conclusion of
that  review,  I  indicated  my  full  concurrence  with  her  analysis.  I
then  left  all  the  materials  with  Dr.  Griffin,  informed  him  that
under  the  terms  of  the  executive  order,  he  was  required  to  certify
that  he  had  reviewed  the  investigation,  and  that  once  he  had  ar-

rived at his course of action, we would prepare the transmittal let-
ter back to Dr. Johnson. The rest of that paragraph deals with how
that letter was sent back.

I  have  been  asked  to  address  concerns  about  the  monitoring  of
Mr. Cobb’s actions under the corrective action plan proposed by Ad-
ministrator  Griffin.  Administrator  Griffin  set  forth  his  rec-
ommendation  in  his  March  14  letter,  and  that  is  available  to  you,
and I am sure you have it.

I have no role in that monitoring process. The IG Act specifically
authorizes that general supervision can be by the principal deputy,
but cannot be delegated any further. Of course, there still exist all
of the options available to any individual who wishes to file a com-
plaint  against  the  Inspector  General,  including  the  Integrity  Com-
mittee,  the  EO  process,  the  Office  of  Special  Counsel,  and  others.
Dr.  Griffin  has  publicly  and  privately  stated  that  he  wants  an
independent Office of Inspector General, committed to its statutory
charter.  I  have  been  the  General  Counsel  at  NASA  since  July  6,
2004.  This  is  in  reference  to  my  personal  relationship,  allegedly,
with  Mr.  Cobb.  My  relationship  with  Mr.  Cobb  is  professional  and
amicable.  Do  we  socialize  together?  No.  I  have  never  been  to  his
home,  nor  he  to  mine.  We  are  professional  colleagues.  As  I  stated
to the staff during our three hour meeting, I find him to be a man
of  integrity.  From  my  perspective,  he  understands  his  role  as  In-
spector  General,  and  carries  it  out  with  conviction  and  force,  and
we understand our boundaries well.

I  was  asked  how  often  I  talked  with  him.  The  answer  is  simple.
Every time I see him. We have worked together to establish an ac-
quisition integrity program, for example, and both of us and our re-
spective staffs firmly believe that it will pay great dividends to the
agency and to the government.

We  also  have  disagreed  on  numerous  occasions  on  the  law,  and
he  has  the  impediment  of  being  as  stubborn  and  oftentimes  as  ar-
gumentative  as  I  am  when  we  believe  we  are  correct.  We  have,  on
a  number  of  issues,  agreed  to  disagree.  I  am  not  sure  how  much
more of my five minutes are here, sir, but——

As  I  stated  to  the  staff  with  whom  I  met  on  April  27,  I  do  not
think that anybody, and I said this to the staff, I do not think that
anybody  wishes  more  than  I  do  that  a  recording  of  that  meeting
could be provided to this body. There were somewhere between 120
and  200  people,  I  believe,  at  that  meeting.  The  vast  majority,  in
fact almost exclusively, OIG people. I believe the only two non-OIG
were probably Mr. Morrell and I, and then, of course, the Adminis-
trator.

To  in  any  way  imply  I  destroyed  copies  of  the  recordings  in  an
attempt  to  destroy  evidence  of  the  substantive  content  of  that
meeting is just not true, sir. Not my intent. I recognize that memo-
ries and perceptions about what occurred there differ.

The rest, sir, you have commented on. I am not in high dudgeon
or  in  a  fit  of  pique.  I  am  just  skeptical  about  anything  that  comes
in front of me. You have every right to be skeptical as well.

Finally,  I  want  to  publicly  apologize  to  everyone  at  NASA  and
this  committee  who  has  had  to  expend  time  and  effort  trying  to
find out whether a copy of this record still exists. I want to particu-
larly  apologize  to  Dr.  Griffin  and  the  leadership  at  NASA.  The

agency  has  important  work  to  do,  of  this  Nation  and  its  people,
work  that  is  critical  to  our  national  security,  our  economic  future.
Misdirections  like  this  are  not  helpful,  and  I  deeply  regret  that  I
have made this a distraction.

I spent my professional life trying to resolve problems, and trying
to make things better. Despite my honest and considered efforts in
the  matter  of  the  destruction  of  the  DVDs,  I  regret  I  failed  to  do
so in this regard and necessitated this hearing.

Thank you, sir.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Wholley follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL C. WHOLLEY

I  have  been  asked  to  address  five  issues  in  my  testimony  today  before  the  Sub-
committee. As you may be aware, I met with the staff of the Subcommittee, as well
as  with  staff  of  other  committees,  on  April  27,  2007  for  approximately  three  hours
and  addressed  these  five  issues,  as  well  as  others,  and  answered  to  the  best  of  my
recollection and belief all of the questions posed to me.
1.  You  have  asked  me  to  address  the  April  10,  2007  meeting  held  by  Dr.  Griffin
with the staff of the NASA OIG. Dr. Griffin had set out his purpose in holding such
a  meeting  in  his  March  14,  2007  letter  to  Mr.  Clay  Johnson  detailing  the  actions
he  intended  to  take  after  reviewing  the  HUD  OIG  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)  on
Mr. Robert Cobb, the NASA Inspector General. In his letter Dr. Griffin stated that:
‘‘. . .I will schedule a meeting with the employees of the NASA Office of Inspec-
tor General to inform them that I have reviewed the ROI and I have taken the
actions that I believe are necessary to address the ROI’s findings. Such a meet-
ing  will  provide  me  an  opportunity  to  listen  to  any  concerns  that  may  exist
among  the  staff  and  to  express  my  support  for  a  strong  and  effective  Office  of
Inspector General.’’

I  was  in  attendance  at  the  meeting,  arriving  with  Dr.  Griffin  and  Mr.  Paul
Morrell, the Chief of Staff. The meeting was held in the video teleconference (ViTS)
room  on  the  lower  level  at  NASA  and  Dr.  Griffin  spoke  initially  for  approximately
ten minutes. He stated, as best I recall, something similar to what he had set forth
in  his  letter  to  Mr.  Johnson  with  respect  to  the  ROI  having  revealed  no  evidence
of a lack of integrity on the part of Mr. Cobb, nor did it indicate any actual conflict
of  interest  or  actual  lack  of  independence  on  his  part.  I  had  watched  Dr.  Griffin’s
interview  on  the  C–Span  program  ‘‘Newsmakers’’  on  Sunday  morning,  April  8,  and
his  remarks  at  this  meeting  were  similar  to  those  he  had  articulated  on  that  pro-
gram. Dr. Griffin then opened up the floor for questions, and several questions were
asked  of  and  answered  by  Dr.  Griffin.  I  believe  that  the  meeting  lasted  a  total  of
less than thirty minutes.
2.  With  respect  to  ‘‘[T]he  subsequent  collection  and  destruction  of  all  video  records
of  Administrator  Griffin’s  meeting  with  the  OIG  staff,’’  my  involvement  was  as  fol-
lows.  At  some  point  the  morning  after  the  meeting,  Paul  Morrell  came  into  my  of-
fice. This was not an unusual occurrence. He had what turned out to be several CD
cases  in  his  hand  and  he  sat  at  the  table  across  from  my  desk.  He  appeared  upset
that, in spite of his direction to the contractor ViTS operator that this closed meet-
ing was not to be recorded, the meeting had been recorded. As best I recall he stated
that  someone  in  Public  Affairs  had  asked  that  the  meeting  be  recorded  and  had
then asked that a number of copies be made. Mr. Morrell indicated that he had re-
covered  the  copies  and  that  this  meeting  was  not  a  public  affairs  event  but  rather
a closed meeting called by the Administrator. I believe I told him that I clearly un-
derstood his pique that his direction had been overridden, and that this closed meet-
ing had been recorded and copied. I believe that at the conclusion of our discussion
I  asked  him  to  leave  the  recordings  with  me,  and  I  put  them  on  my  desk.  I  want
to  categorically  state  that  at  no  time,  and  in  no  way,  did  Mr.  Morrell  indicate  to
me that I should destroy these recordings. That did not happen.

Sometime  either  later  that  day  or  early  the  next  day,  I  honestly  cannot  recall
which,  I  reviewed  relevant  portions  of  the  Federal  Records  Act  (FRA)  and,  in  par-
ticular, the definition of what constituted a record. I also briefly reviewed the Free-
dom  of  Information  Act.  I  concluded  that  these  were  not  ‘‘records’’  for  purposes  of
the FRA, but also concluded that if they were retained and filed they could become
‘‘records’’  by  virtue  of  that  retention.  From  my  perspective,  and  as  I  stated  to  the

‘‘records’’ subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act. This was a closed
meeting,  specifically  directed  to  not  be  recorded,  and  these  DVDs  were  not  Agency
records  at  that  time.  I  personally  made  the  decision  to  destroy  them,  and  I  did  so
by breaking them into pieces and throwing them in the trash.

The  next  time  I  heard  anything  about  these  recordings  was  while  I  was  on  vaca-
tion  in  Florida  the  week  of  April  15th.  In  looking  at  my  e-mails,  I  believe  that  I
first  learned  of  the  request  to  provide  a  copy  of  the  recording  to  this  subcommittee
sometime  in  the  late  afternoon  or  early  evening  on  April  18  when  I  learned  of  this
subcommittee’s letter of the same date. I informed my staff that I did not have any
copies  of  the  recording  and  that  I  had  previously  destroyed  them.  At  some  later
time,  I  learned  that  there  had  been  other  recordings  made  at  other  ViTS  locations.
3.  Regarding  my  role  in  the  response  by  Dr.  Griffin  to  the  report  of  the  Integrity
Committee, I became aware that ‘‘something’’ had been sent to Dr. Griffin from Mr.
Johnson in his role as Chairman of the PCIE with regard to Report of Investigation
of  the  Integrity  Committee.  To  the  best  of  my  recollection,  I  became  aware  of  this
during  a  conversation  with  Mr.  Morrell  that  occurred  while  we  were  at  Ames  Re-
search Center in California at a Strategic Management Council meeting. This would
have  been  either  February  21st  or  22nd.  From  reviewing  my  e-mails  I  have  deter-
mined  that  on  Monday,  February  26th,  Mr.  Morrell  gave  me  what  had  been  deliv-
ered to Dr. Griffin. The ‘‘package’’ consisted of the January 22, 2007 letter from the
Integrity Committee to Mr. Johnson; Mr. Johnson’s transmittal letter to Dr. Griffin,
a  copy  of  the  ‘‘Policy  and  Procedures’’  of  the  Integrity  Committee,  a  copy  of  Execu-
tive Order 12993, a copy of a March 24, 1989 Memorandum Opinion from the Office
of  Legal  Counsel  to  the  Integrity  Committee,  and  a  CD  marked  ‘‘ROI  IC  500,  Vols.
I–III, –FOUO–’’ I asked my Executive Assistant to print all of the documents on the
CD and put them in three ring binders. I made arrangements to meet with Dr. Grif-
fin and discuss how he wanted this handled. He indicated that he wanted the mat-
ter  reviewed  and  that  he  wanted  to  know  the  full  range  of  options  open  to  him  in
light of the Report of Investigation. At some point, on either the 27th or 28th, I dis-
cussed  with  my  Deputy,  Keith  Sefton,  the  possibility  of  having  a  newly-hired  indi-
vidual,  an  experienced  attorney  who  was  due  to  begin  working  in  my  office  on
March 5th, look over the report and provide me her unvarnished opinion. I believed
that  this  was  a  good  option  in  light  of  her  extensive  experience  and  the  fact  that,
so  far  as  I  was  aware,  she  knew  nothing  about  any  of  the  matters  or  the  parties
involved.  I  asked  Mr.  Sefton  to  call  her,  confirm  that  she  knew  nothing  about  the
case, and ask her if she could begin working on it at the earliest opportunity in light
of  the  tight  deadline  that  we  were  facing.  She  agreed  to  do  so,  and  Mr.  Sefton  ar-
ranged  to  deliver  a  copy  of  the  materials  to  her.  I  concurrently  reviewed  the  mate-
rials.  At  the  conclusion  of  her  review  she  provided  me  her  opinion.  I  arranged  a
meeting to brief Dr. Griffin, and had her, the newly-hired attorney, brief him on her
review.  At  the  conclusion  of  her  review,  I  indicated  my  full  concurrence  with  her
analysis.  I  then  left  all  of  the  materials  with  Dr.  Griffin,  informed  him  that  under
the terms of Executive Order 12993 he was required to certify that he had reviewed
the investigation, and that once he had arrived at his course of action we would pre-
pare  the  transmittal  letter  back  to  Mr.  Johnson.  I  believe  that  it  was  on  Monday,
March  12th,  that  I  met  with  Dr.  Griffin  and  received  his  direction  on  what  actions
he wished to take. We had previously discussed that his actions in his ‘‘general su-
pervision’’  role  over  the  IG  were  limited,  and  that  several  of  the  proffered  options
would  in  fact  require  the  concurrence  of  the  Chairman  of  the  PCIE,  Mr.  Johnson.
I  prepared  the  draft  response  for  Dr.  Griffin’s  letter  back  to  Mr.  Johnson  after  the
meeting,  then  had  to  go  on  travel  for  the  remainder  of  the  week.  In  my  absence,
the attorney who had reviewed the matter and who briefed Dr. Griffin worked with
Mr. Morrell to finalize the March 14th letter transmitted back to Mr. Johnson.
4.  Topic  4  that  I  have  been  asked  to  address  concerns  the  ‘‘[M]onitoring  of  Mr.
Cobb’s  actions  under  the  corrective  action  plan  proposed  by  Administrator  Griffin.’’
As indicated in the March 14, 2007 letter from Dr. Griffin, he has directed that Mr.
Cobb  ‘‘. . .meet  with  the  Deputy  Administrator  on  a  bimonthly  basis  to  discuss  his
implementation  of  his  individual  leadership/management  plan  and  his  professional
growth  with  the  Executive  Coach.’’  I  have  no  role  in  that  monitoring  process.  The
IG Act specifically authorizes that ‘‘general supervision’’ can be by the principal dep-
uty,  but  cannot  be  ‘‘delegated’’  further.  Of  course,  there  still  exist  all  of  the  options
available  to  individuals  who  wish  to  file  complaints  against  the  Inspector  General
including  the  Integrity  Committee,  the  EEO  process,  the  Office  of  Special  Counsel,
and  others.  Dr.  Griffin  has  publicly,  and  privately,  stated  that  he  wants  an  inde-
pendent Office of Inspector General that is committed to its statutory charter.

5.  I  have  been  the  General  Counsel  at  NASA  since  July  26,  2004.  My  relationship
with  Mr.  Cobb  is  both  professional  and  amicable.  Do  we  socialize  together:  no.  I
have  never  been  to  his  home,  nor  he  to  mine.  We  are  professional  colleagues.  As
I stated to the staff during our three-hour meeting, I find him to be a man of integ-
rity, intelligent, focused on doing the best possible job he can, and very independent.
And  I  like  that  in  a  person.  From  my  perspective,  he  understands  his  role  as  an
Inspector  General,  carries  it  out  with  conviction  and  force,  and  we  understand  our
boundaries  very  well.  I  was  asked  how  often  I  talked  with  him  and  the  answer  is
quite simple: every time I see him. We have worked together to establish an Acqui-
sition  Integrity  Program,  and  both  of  us,  and  our  respective  staffs,  firmly  believe
that it will pay great dividends to the Agency and to the government. We have also
disagreed  on  the  law  on  occasion,  and  he  has  the  impediment  of  being  as  stubborn
and  argumentative  as  I  am  when  we  believe  that  we  are  correct.  We  have,  on  a
number of issues, ‘‘agreed to disagree.’’

As  I  stated  to  the  staff  with  whom  I  met  on  April  27th,  I  do  not  think  that  any-
body  wishes  more  than  I  do  that  a  recording  of  that  meeting  could  be  provided  to
this body. Your staff has apparently received allegations of what was said and done
at  that  meeting  that  range  from  the  patently  false  to  the  ridiculous.  If  a  video  or
audio recording of the event existed, it would clearly demonstrate what actually oc-
curred  and  we  would  not,  perhaps,  be  having  this  hearing.  There  were,  I  believe,
somewhere between 120 and 200 people, mostly OIG staff members including inves-
tigators,  who  were  present  at  this  meeting.  To  in  any  way  imply  that  I  destroyed
the copies of the recordings in an attempt to destroy evidence of the substantive con-
tent of the meeting beggars belief. I recognize that memories and perceptions differ.
That said, some of the allegations contained in the April 25th letter, and which were
related  to  me  in  my  meeting  with  the  staffers  on  April  27th,  were  so  false  as  to
clearly imply an intent to mislead on the part of those who provided them.

This latter point leads me to comment on a subject that is of significant and grow-
ing  concern  to  me.  I  believe  that  ‘‘facts’’  matter,  and  that  before  any  individual,  or-
ganization or agency is pilloried, before anyone’s reputation is destroyed publicly or
privately, there is an ethical obligation to vigorously ascertain the truth, the factual
underpinnings, of each and every allegation. I come here today with the firm convic-
tion  that  such  is  the  purpose  of  this  hearing.  My  sense  in  this  matter  is  that  there
has  been,  on  the  part  of  some  of  the  people  involved  in  this  matter,  a  certain  ‘‘sen-
tence  first,  verdict  later’’  mindset.  My  sense  is  that  allegations  have  been  slipped
under the door or thrown over the transom, often anonymously or with the request
of  anonymity,  and  in  all-too-many  cases  they  are  immediately  given  a  mantle  of
‘‘credibility’’  because  they  originate  from  someone  ‘‘familiar  with  the  issues’’  and
therefore ‘‘must be true.’’ In the best of all possible worlds some level of skepticism,
some kernel of ‘‘doubt,’’ some due diligence in ascertaining the facts must come into
play.  In  the  best  of  all  possible  worlds  individuals  making  such  allegations  would
be required to swear to the truth of what they are saying, and would be made aware
of  the  consequences  of  any  false  statement.  In  the  best  of  all  possible  worlds,  judg-
ment  would  be  withheld,  and  inflammatory,  inaccurate  public  releases  and  com-
mentary  would  be  curtailed  until  all  allegations  had  undergone  the  scrutiny  of  rig-
orous analysis. While I recognize that such a ‘‘perfect world’’ may not be attainable,
I  nonetheless  believe  that  each  of  us  should  do  our  part  to  come  as  close  to  it  as
possible.

Finally, I want to publicly apologize to everyone at NASA who has had to expend
time  and  effort  trying  to  find  whether  a  copy  of  this  recording  still  exists.  I  want
to particularly apologize to Dr. Griffin and the leadership at NASA. This agency has
important  work  to  do  for  this  nation  and  its  people,  work  that  is  critical  to  our  na-
tional  security  and  our  economic  future,  and  distractions  like  this  are  not  helpful.
I  have  spent  my  professional  life  trying  to  resolve  problems  and  trying  to  make
things better. Despite my honest and considered efforts in the matter of the destruc-
tion of the DVDs, I regret that I have failed to do so in this regard.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  PAUL  MORRELL,  CHIEF  OF  STAFF,  NA-
TIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)
Mr.  MORRELL.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member

Sensenbrenner, Mr. Feeney.

In  his  March  14,  2007  letter  to  Clay  Johnson,  Chairman  of  the
President’s  Executive  Council  on  Integrity  and  Efficiency,  NASA
Administrator  Michael  Griffin  wrote:  ‘‘I  will  schedule  a  meeting

with  the  employees  of  the  NASA  Office  of  Inspector  General  to  in-
form them that I have reviewed the Report of Investigation regard-
ing  the  allegations  of  misconduct  on  the  part  of  NASA  Inspector
General  Robert  Cobb,  and  I  have  taken  the  actions  that  I  believe
are  necessary  to  address  the  Report  of  Investigation’s  findings.
Such a meeting will provide me an opportunity to listen to any con-
cerns  that  may  exist  among  the  staff,  and  to  express  my  support
for a strong and effective Office of Inspector General.’’

In his subsequent letter to Clay Johnson, dated March 29, 2007,
Administrator Griffin wrote: ‘‘In my meeting with IG Cobb and the
OIG  staff,  I  will  make  clear  that  I  expect  and  support  a  strong
OIG,  which  continues  to  be  dedicated  to  identifying  fraud,  waste,
and  abuse,  and  that  I  am  committed  to  leading  an  agency  where
full  and  frank  discussions  are  not  just  tolerated,  but  are  expected,
condoned, and encouraged, in a climate without fear of retribution,
and  one  in  which  the  full  panoply  of  protections  exist  for  whistle-
blowers.’’

The meeting between the Administrator and the Office of Inspec-
tor  General  staff  took  place  on  Tuesday,  April  10.  The  previous
day, on Monday, April 9, I contacted the Office of Public Affairs to
inquire  about  using  the  NASA  TV  facilities  available  in  the  head-
quarters  auditorium  for  the  April  10  meeting,  which  included  OIG
staff  at  headquarters  and  the  various  NASA  centers  across  the
country. The meeting was on a sensitive subject, and I wanted the
OIG  staff  to  feel  free  to  participate  in  a  full  and  free  dialogue.
Therefore,  I  asked  Public  Affairs  to  determine  if  the  equipment
used  in  the  auditorium  could  limit  the  broadcast  of  the  meeting
solely to meeting participants.

Later  that  day,  I  was  informed  that  the  auditorium  equipment
would  not  allow  the  meeting  to  be  limited  to  participants,  and  it
was  recommended  that  the  headquarters  videoconferencing  facility
be used instead. Concerned that the size of the videoconference fa-
cility  was  not  adequate  to  accommodate  the  number  of  OIG  staff
expected  at  the  meeting,  I  went  to  the  facility  and  spoke  to  its
manager, Mr. Fred Berger.

During  my  conversation  with  Mr.  Berger,  we  discussed  whether
the  technology  in  the  auditorium  could  be  used,  whether  the  tech-
nology available in the videoconference center could be used in the
auditorium,  and  whether  the  video  facility  could  accommodate  the
number of OIG staff expected to attend the meeting.

I  also  told  Mr.  Berger  during  our  conversation  that  the  meeting
should  not  be  recorded.  My  reason  for  doing  so  was  my  belief  that
recording the meeting might discourage questions and discussion of
OIG  staff  concerns,  which  was  inconsistent  with  what  I  believed
was the Administrator’s stated purpose for the meeting.

The next day, on April 10, shortly after I arrived at the meeting
with the Administrator, I noticed a display on the video monitor at
the  front  of  the  room  that  indicated  the  meeting  was,  contrary  to
my  instructions,  being  recorded.  Later  that  day,  I  placed  a  call  to
Mr.  Berger  to  inquire  why  the  meeting  had  been  recorded.  Mr.
Berger  was  unavailable,  and  he  returned  my  call  the  following
morning, as I was driving to the office.

I  asked  Mr.  Berger  who  recorded  the  meeting.  He  said  he  did.
I  asked  him  why  he  recorded  it,  contrary  to  my  direction.  Mr.

Berger said he forgot that I had asked him that it not be recorded,
and that Mr. Fred Brown, from NASA TV, under the Office of Pub-
lic  Affairs,  had  requested  that  the  meeting  be  recorded,  and  that
Mr.  Berger  had  provided  Mr.  Brown  with  a  copy  of  the  recording.
I  told  Mr.  Berger  that  I  thought  it  was  highly  inappropriate  for
someone  in  Public  Affairs  to  request  a  recording  of  a  meeting  be-
tween  the  OIG  staff  and  the  Administrator,  especially  when  I  told
him  the  previous  day  that  it  should  not  be  recorded.  I  asked  Mr.
Berger to retrieve the recording from Public Affairs.

I next spoke by phone with my secretary, who informed me that
Mr.  Bob  Jacobs  of  the  Office  of  Public  Affairs  had  delivered  DVD
copies of the meeting to my office. I was, needless to say, surprised
to learn that not only had the meeting been recorded and provided
to Public Affairs, but that Public Affairs was making copies.

When  I  arrived  at  the  office,  I  went  to  see  Mr.  Jacobs.  I  asked
Mr.  Jacobs  if  he  had  requested  that  the  meeting  be  recorded.  He
said  that  he  had.  I  told  Mr.  Jacobs  that  I  believed  it  was  highly
inappropriate  for  him  to  have  requested  a  recording  of  a  closed
meeting  between  the  Administrator  and  the  OIG  staff.  I  told  him
that he did not have the authority to request recordings of the Ad-
ministrator’s  non-Public  Affairs-related  meetings.  I  requested  that
he provide me with any additional copies that he had in his posses-
sion, which he in turn did.

I  then  went  to  see  Mr.  Fred  Berger  at  the  conferencing  facility.
When  I  arrived  at  his  office,  he  was  there  with  Mr.  Fred  Brown
from  NASA  TV.  Mr.  Berger  gave  me  several  more  DVDs.  I  asked
him  if  what  I  had  in  my  possession  represented  all  the  copies.  He
said yes.

I  took  the  DVDs  to  the  NASA  General  Counsel.  I  explained  to
Mr. Mike Wholley, excuse me, what had happened, that a non-Pub-
lic  Affairs-related  meeting  had  been  recorded  by  Public  Affairs
without proper consent or authorization, despite the fact that I said
it  should  not  be  recorded.  I  asked  Mr.  Wholley  what  I  should  do
with the DVDs. He said I should leave them with him.

I  left  the  General  Counsel’s  office  believing  they  were  in  the  ap-
propriate hands. I never directed that any DVD or recording be de-
stroyed.  It  was  my  understanding  that  the  original  recording  had
been  made  at  headquarters,  and  that  all  existing  copies  had  been
taken to the Office of the General Counsel.

To the best of my recollection and belief, I was unaware that cop-
ies  of  the  meeting  had  been  made  and  destroyed  at  NASA  centers
until some time after the April 10 meeting had occurred, and I be-
lieve,  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge,  it  was  some  time  the  following
week.

It was and remains my strong belief that the Office of Public Af-
fairs had no legitimate reason or authority to request, copy, or pos-
sess  a  recording  of  what  was  a  non-Public  Affairs-related  meeting
between the Administrator and the OIG staff. Furthermore, it was
and  remains  my  very  strong  belief  that  participants  in  a  closed
meeting  have  the  right  to  expect  that  the  contents  of  the  meeting
will  remain  secure  and  private,  even  when  they  know  the  meeting
is  being  recorded.  It  was  my  very  strong  concern  that  the  posses-
sion  of  the  recording  by  Public  Affairs  compromised  the  foregoing.

The  Subcommittee  asked  me  to  address  my  role  in  the  Adminis-
trator’s  response  to  the  report  of  the  President’s  Council  on  Integ-
rity  and  Efficiency.  My  role  was  as  a  facilitator:  scheduling  meet-
ings, conveying information, and coordinating the preparation, edit-
ing,  review,  and  approval  of  correspondence.  I  did  not  review  the
Report  of  Investigation,  and  I  did  not  make  recommendations  to
the  Administrator  regarding  his  response  to  the  Report  of  Inves-
tigation.

As you know, the Administrator recommended several actions to
the  Chairman  of  the  PCIE,  and  obtained  his  concurrence,  con-
sistent with the Inspector General Act. Those recommendations in-
cluded  IG  Cobb’s  attendance  at  the  Federal  Executive  Institute
courses,  and  the  assistance  of  an  executive  coach  to  help  enhance
IG Cobb’s leadership and management skills. In addition, IG Cobb
will  meet  with  the  Deputy  Administrator  on  a  bimonthly  basis  to
discuss  the  implementation  of  his  individual  leadership  and  man-
agement  plan,  and  his  work  with  the  executive  coach.  The  Deputy
Administrator’s  meetings  with  IG  Cobb  will  be  one  way  of  moni-
toring  his  progress  and  his  commitment  to  improving  his  manage-
ment skills. In addition, there are a number of options available to
OIG  staff  to  report  any  future  allegations  of  inappropriate  actions.

I  also  told  Mr.  Berger  during  our  conversation  that  the  meeting  should  not  be  re-
corded. My reason for doing so was my belief that recording the meeting might dis-
courage questions and discussion of OIG staff concerns, which was inconsistent with

I  never  directed  that  any  DVD  or  recording  be  destroyed.  It  was  my  under-

DISCUSSION

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Morrell.
On the documents, or most of the documents that NASA has pro-
vided  in  response  to  this  committee’s  request,  there  is,  stamped  in
large  type  across  the  face  of  the  document,  in  a  way  that  almost
obscures  the  contents  of  the  documents,  makes  them  very  hard  to
read,  and  in  the  original,  I  understand  that  it  is  in  red  ink:  ‘‘This
document  is  provided  by  NASA  solely  for  Congressional  use  and
not  for  further  release.  No  waiver  of  FOIA  exemption  or  internal
agency  working  document/predecisional/attorney-client  privileges
are waived in this provision for Congressional use beyond the pur-
poses  of  the  committees  making  the  request.’’  To  whom  is  that
warning intended?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  I  don’t  believe  it  is  a  warning.  I  believe  it  is
the  recognition  that  these  are,  in  many  cases,  predecisional  docu-
ments that would not be releasable under FOIA, and it was not in-
tended, certainly, as a warning to this committee.

Chairman MILLER. All right. Do you contend that this committee
cannot release the documents that you have provided us, under our
oversight authority, to the public?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Sir, if we were requested for them, we would deny

them under FOIA.

cannot——

Chairman  MILLER.  But  you  don’t  claim  that  this  committee

Mr. WHOLLEY. I make no such claim.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  I  am  struck  by  two  provisions  of  pas-
sages  in  Mr.  Morrell’s  testimony  and  Mr.  Wholley’s  testimony.  Mr.
Morrell,  you  quoted  the  letter  from  Administrator  Griffin  on  the
first page of your testimony: ‘‘I am committed to leading an agency
where full and frank discussions are not just tolerated, but are ex-
pected, condoned, and encouraged, in a climate without fear of ret-
ribution,  and  one  in  which  the  full  panoply  of  protections  exist  for
whistleblowers.’’

Mr. Morrell, do you think that is the climate in which NASA and
every  agency  should  conduct  their  business?  And  Mr.  Wholley,  do
you agree with that?

Mr. MORRELL. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Mr.  Wholley,  in  your  testimony,  you
said: ‘‘My sense is that the allegations have been slipped under the
door  or  thrown  over  the  transom,  often  anonymously  or  with  the
request  of  anonymity,  and  in  all  too  many  cases,  they  are  imme-
diately  given  a  mantle  of  credibility,  because  they  originate  from
someone  ‘‘familiar  with  the  issues,’’  and  therefore  ‘‘must  be  true.’’
In  the  best  of  all  possible  worlds,  individuals  making  such  allega-
tions would be required to swear to the truth of what they are say-
ing,  and  would  be  made  aware  of  the  consequences  of  any  false
statement.’’

Mr. Wholley, aren’t we talking about the same people? Aren’t we

talking about whistleblowers?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Sir, I——

Chairman  MILLER.  People  who  throw  allegations  over  the  tran-

som to us?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  this  was  not  referring  to  things  that  have
come before the Committee. It was referring to the number of alle-
gations  against  Mr.  Cobb  in  that  Report  of  Investigation,  many  of
which were unfounded, some of which were dismissed out of it.

Chairman  MILLER.  Those  were  from  NASA  employees  that  were

whistleblowers, were they not?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  am  not  sure  who  they  were,  sir,  and  I  am  not

sure how many of them would qualify as whistleblowers.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Well,  it  seems  like  there  is  some  cat-
egory  of  a  NASA  employee  that  is  a  whistleblower,  and  that  is  a
good  thing.  That  is  a  wholesome  thing.  They  are  patriotic  Ameri-
cans.  And  then,  there  is  some  other  category  of  NASA  employees
who  throw  things  over  the  transom  and  request  anonymity  for  it
that  is  an  unwholesome  thing.  Can  you  tell  us  how  we  are  sup-
posed to tell the difference?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  I  am  not  saying  that  one  should  try  and  dis-
tinguish  the  difference.  What  I  said  was  when  they  come  in  that
way,  one  needs  to,  as  best  as  possible,  try  and  find  the  factual
underpinnings  for  whatever  is  being  said,  as  opposed  to  taking  it
as gospel as it comes through.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Mr. Morrell, you spoke approvingly, or
quoted  approvingly  from  Mr.  Griffin’s  letter,  how  whistleblowers
should  be  regarded  and  protected.  Do  you  see  anything  in  Mr.
Wholley’s  testimony  that  is  contrary  to  how  you  describe  the  way
whistleblowers should be treated or regarded?

Mr.  MORRELL.  I  don’t  want  to  speak  for  Mr.  Wholley,  but  I  do
believe that whistleblowers should have all the protections afforded
under law.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Sensenbrenner. I will have time for addi-

tional questions.

MORE ON THE DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  want  to  get  to  the  tape  of  the  meeting,  and  what  happened  to
it, and I have 44 United States Code Section 3301, and I will quote
it  in  total:  ‘‘  As  used  in  this  chapter,  ‘‘records’’  includes  all  books,
papers,  maps,  photographs,  machine  readable  materials,  or  other
documentary  materials,  regardless  of  physical  form  or  characteris-
tics, made or received by an agency of the United States under fed-
eral  law  in  connection  with  the  transaction  of  public  business  and
preserved  or  appropriate  for  preservation  by  that  agency  or  its  le-
gitimate  successor  as  evidence  of  the  organization,  functions,  poli-
cies,  decisions,  procedures,  operations,  or  other  activities  of  the
Government or because of the informational value of data in them.
Library  and  museum  material  made  or  acquired  and  preserved
solely  for  reference  or  exhibition  purposes,  extra  copies  of  docu-
ments  preserved  only  for  convenience  of  reference,  and  stocks  of
publications and of processed documents are not included.’’

Now,  from  that,  it  appears  that  the  tape  was  a  public  record,
that  was  at  least  preserved  for  a  brief  period  of  time,  or  appro-
priate for preservation, because it did deal with the functions, poli-
cies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the gov-

34

ernment.  So,  I  think  it  is  very  clear  that  the  tape  was  a  public
record.

Now,  it  is  also  a  crime  to  destroy  public  records.  Mr.  Wholley,
with  your  legal  analysis  of  having  these  records  destroyed,  were
you  familiar  with  the  litigation  relative  to  Henry  Kissinger’s  notes
while he was at the State Department?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  No,  sir.  I  can’t,  I  cannot  own  up  to  some  famili-

arity with it.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay. Well, let me tell you what they said.
First  of  all,  in  Reporters  Committee  for  Freedom  of  the  Press  v.
Vance,  which  was  decided  by  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Dis-
trict  of  Columbia,  the  notes  that  were  made  of  Kissinger’s  con-
versations  while  at  the  State  Department  were  federal  records
under the FRA. Then, that case went up, and there was other liti-
gation,  and  it  said  the  determinant  factor  for  creating  a  federal
record  is  whether  the  record  was  made  at  government  expense,
that  is,  with  government  materials  and  on  government  time.  I
think very clearly this tape was made at government expense, with
government materials, and on government time.

Have you ever been asked to give advice to anybody in NASA rel-
ative  to  what  records  can  be  destroyed,  and  if  so,  what  was  that?
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  No,  sir.  I  can’t  say  that  I  have  been  personally

asked to give advice to anybody on that.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Well,  isn’t  it  your  job,  when  an  issue  like
this  comes  up,  and  you  were  personally  involved  in  destroying  at
least  the  tapes  that  were  in  the  NASA  headquarters,  that  you
should be concerned about what the law is on this subject?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Okay.  Is  it  your  belief  that  the  tape,  once

it was made, was a government record?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Why not?
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  If—had  it  been—had  that  been  my  belief,  sir,  I

would not have destroyed it.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Well, why not? I read the relevant portions

of the law.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  I  read  the  determinant  cases,  when  Mr.
Kissinger claimed that his notes should be private, and not govern-
ment record, you know, it isn’t very hard to dig the cases out. Isn’t
that the job of a General Counsel to do that?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir. It is.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Okay.  Well,  it  wasn’t  done.  Now,  Mr.
Morrell.  You  testified  you  didn’t  have  anything  to  do  with  the  de-
struction  of  the  tapes,  and  did  you  speak  to  the  technician,  Mr.
Berger, who made the tapes, after the teleconference?

Mr. MORRELL. The next morning, sir.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay. And after your conversation, did Mr.
Berger  erase  his  copy  of  the  teleconference,  and  called  NASA  cen-
ters up, asking them to do the same?

Mr. MORRELL. I have heard that he had.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay. Did you ask him to do it?
Mr. MORRELL. I did not.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay.

Mr.  MORRELL.  It  was  my  understanding  that  the  recording  had

been made at headquarters.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Who is Keith Thomas Sefton?
Mr. MORRELL. He is Mr. Wholley’s Deputy.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. So, he is an attorney as well? Okay. Berger
wrote,  on  an  e-mail  to  Mr.  Sefton,  dated  April  30,  which  was  after
the April 27 meeting: ‘‘At 10:15 a.m. on Wednesday, April 11, 2007,
I  received  a  call  from  Paul  Morrell.  During  that  phone  conversa-
tion,  Paul  asked  me  to  contact  my  counterparts  at  the  centers  to
find out if those who recorded the meeting still have the recordings,
or  if  they  could  retrieve  them.  Paul  wanted  me  to  ask  them  to
erase  videotapes  or  shred  DVDs  of  their  recordings.’’  And  this  was
an e-mail from Fred Berger to Keith Sefton.

Mr. Wholley, were you aware of that e-mail?
Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir. Not at the time.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. So, your deputy didn’t tell you this?
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  to  be  honest  with  you,  I  was  trying  to  stay
away  from—in  fact,  when—well,  the  answer  is  I  can’t  remember
when I learned of it, but you know——

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  What  were  you  planning  on  staying  away

from?

con.

Mr. WHOLLEY. I wanted to stay away from any involvement that,
because I was involved in the destruction of tapes, I wanted to stay
away  from  any  involvement  in  talking  to  any  of  the  witnesses.  In
fact, when the Committee asked for any e-mails, or any documents,
I  turned  my  computer  over  to  another  attorney  in  the  office,  and
said this is everything I have, just take what you believe is respon-
sive.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. And what—which attorney was that?
Mr. WHOLLEY. That was Ms. Donovan.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Now——
Mr. WHOLLEY. I believe she worked with her supervisor, Mr. Fal-

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Okay.  And  Mr.  Morrell,  I  have  read  you
this  e-mail  from  Fred  Berger,  who  was  the  technician  that  did  the
recording, to Keith Thomas Sefton, who works in Mr. Wholley’s of-
fice.

That  is  at  variance  with  the  testimony  that  you  have  given  and

the answer to my question. How can you explain that?

Mr. MORRELL. I can’t explain it, sir. All I know is I asked where
it  was  recorded.  He  said  he  recorded  it  at  headquarters.  He  said
that  it  had  been  given  to  Public  Affairs,  and  I  asked  him  to  get  it
back. Never any——

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  I  would  repeat  what  is  in  the—part  of  the
mail:  ‘‘Paul  wanted  me  to  ask  them  to  erase  videotapes  or  shred
DVDs of their recordings.’’

Mr.  MORRELL.  I  did  not  do  that.  When  I  had  all  the  copies  that
were at headquarters, Mr. Berger gave me the final copies, I asked
him was this everything, and he said yes.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay.
Mr.  MORRELL.  And  at  that  point,  I  knew  I  didn’t  know  what
needed to be done with them, so I took them to the General Coun-
sel.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no

further questions.

MORE ON THE APRIL 10TH MEETING

Mr.  FEENEY.  Mr.  Wholley,  I  think  it  was,  at  best,  a  foolish  mis-
take  to  destroy  the  videotapes.  I  want  to  make  that  clear.  But  I
also want to ask you some questions. Is it your understanding that
as part of a decision-making process before a final conclusion or de-
cision or report is issued, that notes and documents that are used,
in  terms  of  developing  the  final  decision,  are  subject  fully  to  the
FRA?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  would  have  to  look  at  that  in  context.  I  am  not
quite  sure  I  have  the  entirety  of  your  question.  Predecisional  stuff
that——

Mr. FEENEY. Predecisional.
Mr. WHOLLEY. No.
Mr. FEENEY. And in the two letters that Mr. Griffin penned, the
first letter, of March 14, he says that one of the purposes is to have
an  opportunity  and  ‘‘to  listen  to  any  concerns  that  may  exist
amongst  the  staff,  and  to  express  my  support  for  a  strong  and  ef-
fective Office of Inspector General.’’ In his subsequent letter to Clay
Johnson, on March 29, he says that he wants to make it clear that
he is ‘‘committed to leading an agency where full and frank discus-
sions  are  not  just  tolerated,  but  are  expected,  condoned,  and  en-
couraged.’’

And  it  seems  to  me,  when  I  am  trying  to  have  that  sort  of  con-
versation  with  my  staff,  that  a  video  recording  is  the  last  thing  I
want to encourage those sorts of full and frank discussions. And so,
do  you  share  Mr.  Morrell’s  opinion  that  this  meeting  should  never
have  been  taped  in  the  first  place,  given  the  purposes  that  Mr.
Griffin laid out in those two letters?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir. I share that. As I recall, the conversation
when he came in that morning, which was the morning of the 11th,
with the copies that Public Affairs had made, as you could tell, his
concern was that Public Affairs had no right to tape a meeting that
was supposed to be a private, internal, closed meeting between the
Administrator and the staff of the Inspector General. If I may, the
first  time  I  became  aware,  and  this  relates  back  to  something  Ms.
Klemstine  said,  and  the  first  time  I  became  aware  that  there  was
an  internal  policy  within  the  IG  that  their  meetings  are  recorded,
so  other  people  can  see  them,  was  when  I  saw  the  IG’s  response
back. I did not consider this an IG’s meeting. It was an Administra-
tor’s meeting.

Mr. FEENEY. And you were in the meeting. Is——
Mr. WHOLLEY. Sir, I walked in with Mr. Morrell and Mr. Griffin,
and Mr. Griffin walked immediately to the front of the room, faced
the audience, and began talking.

Mr. FEENEY. Did you know that the meeting was being recorded

at that point?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  No,  I  did  not.  I  know  there  were  signs  up.  I  was
sitting, what would have been on the very far right of a semicircle,
as  Dr.  Griffin  looked,  and  Mr.  Berger  was  in  front  of  me.  There
may well have been signs. I was, I just did not see them.

37

Mr.  FEENEY.  Our  last  two  witnesses,  including  Ms.  Klemstine,
said that it was clear to people that were viewing the monitor that
the meeting was being recorded. That was my understanding of her
testimony. Did you know that, Mr. Morrell?

Mr. MORRELL. Yes, there were signs.
Mr.  FEENEY.  There  were  signs,  but  Mr.  Wholley,  you  didn’t  see

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  didn’t  see  them.  I  mean,  frankly,  I  wasn’t  look-

the signs?

ing for them.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, one can only wonder, given the fact that there
were  concerns  that  Mr.  Cobb  was  in  the  room,  apparently.  There
were  concerns  about  the  tenor  of  Mr.  Griffin’s  remarks.  One  can
only—but  nobody  expressed  them  at  that  meeting.  One  can  only
wonder  whether  it  was  the  video,  as  much  as  anything,  that  may
have  intimidated  some  of  the  people  that  had  concerns  that  they
expressed after the meeting, but not at the meeting.

And  so,  again,  I  want  to  say  that  at  best,  it  was  a  foolish  deci-
sion,  in  my  view,  in  retrospect,  to  destroy  the  tapes  that  should
have not been made in the first place, but it seems to me clear that
if  I  were  having  a  meeting  like  this  with  my  staff,  video  cameras
on all of us would be the last thing that I would want to encourage
full and frank discussions and concerns.

And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Morrell,  I  also  would  like  to
encourage  candor  within  your  staff.  You  believe  that  it  would  in-
hibit, kill candid discussions within the staff to have it videotaped,
but having a discussion of the findings of improprieties of the alle-
gations of misconduct by the Inspector General Cobb, with their su-
pervisor,  Inspector  Cobb,  sitting  right  there,  would  not  inhibit  the
discussion.  That  could  be  free,  that  could  be  open,  that  could  be
candid, with him sitting right there?

Mr. MORRELL. I didn’t say that. I am sure that some people may

have felt intimidated by having him there.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  And  do  you  think  that  inhibited

conversation within that room?

Mr.  MORRELL.  Perhaps  it  did.  It  would  be  very  possible,  in  fact.
Chairman MILLER. Very much sense that it would?
Mr.  MORRELL.  Perhaps  some  people  would  be  inhibited  to  speak
up. I think it—I mean, people did ask questions. I thought perhaps
some  people  would  have—there  would  have  been  more  than  what
there was, but——

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  the  Inspector,  the  guy  they  are  talking
about  is  sitting  right  there,  beside  Administrator  Griffin.  Is  that
right?

Mr. MORRELL. He was not beside the Administrator.
Chairman  MILLER.  He  was  in  the  room.  Okay.  And  they  were
talking about him. And they were talking about allegations of mis-
conduct by him.

Mr. MORRELL. Correct.
Chairman  MILLER.  And  that,  you  thought,  could  be  an  uninhib-

ited, free, candid discussion.

Mr.  MORRELL.  I  didn’t  say—Mr.  Chairman,  I  didn’t  say  that.  I
can  tell  you  that  the  Administrator  felt  that  if  he  was  going  to  be
talking about the IG, the IG should be in the room.

38

Chairman MILLER. If you were concerned, Mr. Morrell, it strikes
me  if  you  were  concerned  about  the  candor  in  the  room,  and  mak-
ing people feel that they should have an uninhibited discussion, to
say  what  was  on  their  mind,  that  it  was  not  the  taping  of  it  that
inhibited  that,  it  was  having  Mr.  Cobb  right  there,  and  also,  the
tenor of what we understand Administrator Griffin said.

Now,  we  don’t  have  the  tape  to  see  what  he  said.  We  have  still
not  been  provided  the  written  statement  that  you  said  that  he
used, but——

Mr.  MORRELL.  On  the  written  statement,  it  was  prepared  from

some talking points that we had prepared, and——

Chairman MILLER. And can we get those?
Mr. MORRELL. You should have them already.
Chairman MILLER. We do not.
Mr.  MORRELL.  I  can  get  them  to  you,  but  they  were  provided,  I

believe, in the first set of documents that you requested.

Chairman MILLER. All right.
Mr. MORRELL. It is not a complete document. It is a partial docu-

ment, of what he used.

Chairman MILLER. All right. Mr. Morrell, Mr. Wholley wrote you
an  e-mail  on  March  14,  which  we  have  been  provided,  about  this
proposed  meeting.  The  proposal  in  the  letter  to  Clay  Johnson  that
Mr.  Griffin  would  address  the  Inspector  General  staff.  It  is  before
you, as Exhibit 10. Do you have it?

Mr. MORRELL. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. All right. Do you recognize that e-mail?
Mr. MORRELL. I do.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Can  you  read  it  through  the  warning

that you not disclose it beyond the Congressional Committee?

Mr. MORRELL. I can probably get through it.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  I  would  like  to  read  from  it:  ‘‘Paul,  I
wasn’t  very  articulate  in  our  discussion  last  night  and  I  apologize.
Truth  is,  I  am  very  troubled  by  the  proffered  ‘‘addition’’  to  the  let-
ter,’’ ‘‘to call a ‘‘special meeting’’ of the IG staff and not be prepared
to  back  Moose,’’  that  is  the  Inspector  General  Cobb,  ‘‘in  a  strong
way  would  undercut  Moose,  grant  more  credibility  to  the  com-
plaints,  and  the  investigation  than  warranted,  and  be,  I  believe,
counterproductive. On the other hand, to call a special meeting and
praise Moose in front of the selected group,’’ the IG staff, ‘‘will risk
Mike becoming the center of the controversy,’’ Mr. Griffin, Adminis-
trator Griffin. ‘‘As I said last night, I see no upside for Mike in the
proposed course of action, and I do see a downside. I know that this
is a not a legal matter, but I am concerned about how this will play
out if the suggested course of action is adopted.’’

Do you remember getting that e-mail?
Mr. MORRELL. Yeah.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Did I read that faithfully?
Mr. MORRELL. I believe so.
Chairman MILLER. All right. Do you recall the conversations that

you had with Mr. Wholley?

Mr. MORRELL. Vaguely.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Do you recall the e-mail?
Mr. MORRELL. Yes.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Did you have the same concerns?

Mr. MORRELL. I raised this issue with the Administrator. He did
not believe that he was going there to defend the IG or to criticize
the  IG,  but  to  talk  about  facts,  and  it  was  something  that  he  de-
cided he wanted to do.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Well, the concern, the reaction that the
previous  two  witnesses,  Mr.  Winters  and  Ms.  Klemstine,  in  par-
ticular,  described,  aren’t  those  exactly  the  reactions  that  Mr.
Wholley was concerned would result from such a meeting?

Mr. MORRELL. I believe so.
Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Did  you  share  those  concerns?  Did

you have the same concerns that Mr. Wholley had?

Mr.  MORRELL.  I  don’t  believe  at  the  time  I  did.  I  believed  that

the Administrator would go in, discuss facts——

Chairman MILLER. All right.
Mr. MORRELL.—what we was asked to do, what he decided to do,
and  what  his  expectations  were  for  the  Office,  as  he  stated  in  his
letter.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  All  the  testimony  today  has  been
that  there  were  signs  everywhere.  There  were—let  me  not  exag-
gerate.  There  were  visible  signs,  readily  visible  signs,  saying  that
the meeting was being taped. The two previous witnesses said that
they  noticed  the  signs.  They  assumed  that  they  were  being,  the
meeting was being taped. Did you notice those signs?

Mr. MORRELL. I did.
Chairman MILLER. All right. Why did you not say at the time to

stop the taping of the meeting?

Mr.  MORRELL.  When  I  noticed  that  the  Administrator  was  al-
ready  speaking,  Mr.  Berger  was  at  his  console  working,  and  I  de-
cided it wasn’t appropriate to interrupt the meeting.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  have  abused  my  time  again.  Mr.  Sensen-

brenner.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. I will yield the Chairman my time.

MORE ON THE DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  You  had  collected  the  DVDs.  You
took them to Mr. Wholley. Why did you take them to him? He said
that you didn’t specifically say destroy these. What did you say?

Mr.  MORRELL.  I  believe  what  I  told—I  recapped  what  had  hap-
pened, that I didn’t ask—I asked that the meeting not be recorded,
but Public Affairs had apparently put in a request. I thought it was
inappropriate,  didn’t  believe  that  Public  Affairs  had  any  authority
or  legitimate  reason  for  doing  so,  that  I  collected  them,  take  them
from Public Affairs, and I had them, and I didn’t know what to do
with them.

Chairman  MILLER.  What  did  you  expect  Mr.  Wholley  would  do

Mr. MORRELL. Part of the reason I brought them to him was be-
cause they had maintained the records on the IG investigation, and
I  figured  he  would  be,  you  know,  he  and  his  office  would  know
what to do with them.

Chairman MILLER. Did you say that to Mr. Wholley, that because

he was maintaining the other records pertaining to the——

Mr.  MORRELL.  No,  what  I  asked  him  was  what  should  I  do  with

with them?

these?

Chairman MILLER. And he said leave them with me?
Mr. MORRELL. Yes.
Chairman  MILLER.  Did  it  not  occur  to  you  that  he  might  infer
from  your  conduct  that  you  wanted  them  destroyed?  I  mean,  it
seems like you came powerfully close to saying, ‘‘Will no one rid me
of these troublesome DVDs, these meddlesome DVDs?’’

Mr.  MORRELL.  No,  sir.  That  was  not  my  intent.  I  was  never,  it

was never my intent to destroy anything.

Chairman  MILLER.  Did  you  ask  Mr.  Wholley  if  you  could  throw

the tapes away?

stroyed?

Mr. MORRELL. No.
Chairman  MILLER.  Did  you  ask  him  if  the  tapes  could  be  de-

Mr. MORRELL. No.
Chairman MILLER. Did you ask him to research the law on what

needed to become of the tapes?

Mr.  MORRELL.  I  believe  as  I  was  leaving,  he  said  he  was,  some-
thing  to  the  effect  that  he  would  look  into  it,  or  something  to  that
effect.

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Wholley,  how  many  lawyers  reported  to

you at that time?

Mr. WHOLLEY. In the Office of General Counsel?
Chairman MILLER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WHOLLEY. At headquarters, in the neighborhood of 35.
Chairman  MILLER.  And  were  there  others  in  other  places  within

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, there are attorneys at all ten centers.
Chairman MILLER. And how many attorneys in all are there?
Mr. WHOLLEY. Approximately 152 at this time.
Chairman  MILLER.  152  lawyers,  and  35  are  right  there  at  your

elbow.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Did  you  ask  any  of  them  to  research

the law on your behalf?
Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  You  did  not  give  the  research  assignment  to

any lawyer?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir.
Chairman MILLER. You looked at the books yourself?
Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Generally,  I  applaud  that  in  lawyers.  It
doesn’t  happen  often.  Do  you  have  a  background  in  FOIA  or
records,  or  records  law?  You  said  earlier  you  are  not  familiar  with
the  case  law  that  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  referred  to.  Is  that  an  area
that has been an area of specialty for you, or concentration?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Certainly not a specialty, sir. In terms of my past
time serving as the Staff Judge Advocate of various commands and
serving at headquarters.

Chairman  MILLER.  Were  there  lawyers  within  the  160,  however
many  who  reported  to  you,  who  did  have  that  as  an  area  of  their
concentration?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Yes,  sir.  That  would  be  the  General  Law  Section.
Chairman MILLER. The General Law Section, but you did not in-

quire of anyone in the General Law Section?

Mr. WHOLLEY. I did not.
Chairman MILLER. Why did you not?
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Well,  I  guess  one  reason,  it  was  a  very  sensitive
matter.  As  my  attorneys  will  tell  you,  I  do  a  lot  of  my  own  re-
search.  Even  after  they  present  a  product,  although  it  is  not  a
question  of  not  trusting  them.  I  am,  as  you  may  have  gotten  from
my  statement,  I  am  a  show  me  the  data,  look  at  the  law.  I  looked
at  exactly  what  Ranking  Member  Sensenbrenner  said,  ‘44  U.S.C.
sec. 44.’ I looked at the FOIA. And sir, as I mentioned in my writ-
ten  remarks,  I  didn’t  start  on  this  right  away.  It  was  some  time
later that day. There were other things going on. It was some time
later  that  day.  From  my  perspective,  these  were  recordings  that
were made by the Public Affairs Office, of a private, closed meeting
of the Administrator. They should not have been made.

Chairman MILLER. All right. Mr. Wholley, Mr. Morrell discussed
the e-mail that you sent him before the meeting, that I read aloud.
Do  you  recall  that  e-mail?  Do  you  recall  your  conversations  about
your concern about how it looked?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  don’t  recall  the  conversation  from  the  night  be-

fore. I do recall the e-mail.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  So  you  expressed  a  concern  in  the  e-

mail about how it would all look one way or the other.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  so,  you  were  present  at  the  meet-

ing, correct?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir. I was.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Were  you  aware  then  of  the  concerns
that Ms. Klemstine expressed, and Mr. Winters expressed, that the
staff members felt about what was said at the meeting?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, I was not aware then, sir, and it is——
Chairman MILLER. Well, hearing what happened at the meeting,

did you have any of those concerns yourself?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No.
Chairman  MILLER.  But  you  did  know  that  there  was  a  very
strong  potential  problem  one  way  or  the  other,  of  this  meeting  not
looking  good,  of—either  if  Administrator  Griffin  said  Moose  Cobb
is my boy, or if he criticized Moose Cobb to his own employees?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir. I had concerns.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr. WHOLLEY. They were expressed in the e-mail.
Chairman  MILLER.  And  you  knew  at  the  time  that  this  was  a
subject, at that point, Senator Nelson, Chairman Bart Gordon, and
I  had  all  urged  the  President  to  fire  Moose  Cobb.  You  knew  that,
did you not?

Mr. WHOLLEY. I am trying to put, I believe your letter was, that

particular letter was early April, April 3, perhaps.

Chairman MILLER. April 2.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Second.
Chairman MILLER. But that was before the meeting.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. It was before the tapes were destroyed.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.

sir.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  You  knew  that  how  this  whole  matter
was being handled was something that the oversight committees of
Congress were interested in, did you not?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  knew  they  were  interested  in  the  matter,  yes,

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  you  knew,  you  said  that  you  did

not want this to subject to FOIA if you kept it. Isn’t that right?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  That  is  what  I  said,  sir.  If,  but  as  I,  that  is  only
half  of  what  I  said.  I  said  I  did  not  believe  they  were  agency
records,  but  if  we  retained  them,  they  would  become  agency
records.  From  my  perspective,  we  had  five  copies  that  Public  Af-
fairs had made of a closed meeting between the Administrator and
the IG staff, that was not only not authorized, but was specifically
said not to be recorded.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Will the Chairman yield?
Chairman MILLER. The Chairman happily yields.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  In  what  part  of  the  Federal  Records  Act  is
it  intended  to  encourage  agencies  to  destroy  records  promptly  so
that  they  won’t  become  records?  Is  there  any  clause  in  that?  I
haven’t been able to find it.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Sir, I have never looked for that clause, nor have

I been able to find it.

Chairman.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Well,  it  isn’t  there.  I  yield  back  to  the

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Sensenbrenner.
Mr.  Wholley,  you  are  also  a  lawyer,  and  the  General  Counsel  of
NASA.  Are  you  familiar  with  the  evidentiary  concept  of  spoilation,
s-p-o-i-l-a-t-i-o-n, spoilation?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. And describe that concept for me.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Basically, inferences can be taken negative to the

person who fails to provide certain evidence.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  certainly,  destroys  it,  knowing  that  that
the  documents  are  subject  to,  would  be  evidence  in  a  pending  liti-
gation, or anticipated litigation, or an inquiry from Congress?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir. May I continue?
Chairman MILLER. You may.
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  don’t  know  how  to  get  that  across  any  more
clearly.  At  the  time  that  I,  having  finished  my  research,  which  we
now may say was not sufficient, at that time, I did not believe they
were  federal  records.  I  did  not  believe  Public  Affairs  should  have
copies.  I  did  not  believe  there  was  any  reason  for  these  copies  to
exist  and  be  filed,  or  they  could  become  federal  records,  and  pos-
sibly FOIA-able, and as perhaps impossible as this may seem, I did
not  consider,  truly,  I  did  not  consider  the  political  aspects  of  this.
As  I  have  said,  nobody  regrets  more  that  I  can’t  produce  that

particular DVD.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  you  are  aware  that  now,  there  are  em-
ployees  of,  you  spoke  of  it,  or  you  wrote  of  it  in  your  written  testi-
mony,  you  did  not  get  to  it  in  your  oral  testimony,  that  there  are
employees  of  NASA  who  attended  that  meeting,  who  are  now  pro-
viding  us  with  accounts  of  the  meeting  that  you  described  as  pat-
ently ridiculous, outrageous——

43

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  your  staff  informed  me  of  several  allegations

that were patently ridiculous and outrageous.

Chairman  MILLER.  Knowing  everything  that  you  knew  then,
knowing  that  this  meeting  was  in  its  very  conception  a  problem,
knowing  that  we  were  interested,  Congress  was  interested,  the
oversight  committees  were  interested  in  how  NASA  dealt  with  the
PCIE  recommendations,  knowing  that  we  would  likely  eventually
ask for that DVD, if it still existed, why is there not every element
of spoliation present, so we should assume the worst?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Sir——
Chairman MILLER. Under ordinary rules of evidence.
Mr. WHOLLEY. I cannot stop you from assuming the worst, other
than  to  say,  sir,  that  there  were  120  to  180  people  in  there,  many
of  whom  were  NASA  IG  investigators.  There  was  certainly  no  in-
tent on my part to destroy evidence. Frankly, that just was not my
intent. As I have stated to your staff, and as I will state here, what
I  did,  I  did  in  good  faith.  If  it  was  a  mistake  that  I  made  on  the
law,  it  is  probably  not  the  first  one  I  have  ever  made,  nor  will  it,
unfortunately,  be  the  last.  But  it  was  an  honest  mistake,  and  I
deeply regret that I destroyed them, for the reason that we are now
here debating this.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Is it your practice to destroy other fed-

eral property?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Have you done it on any other occasion?
Mr. WHOLLEY. Not that I can consciously recall, sir.
Chairman MILLER. All right. And how did you do it in this case?

Exactly how did you destroy those DVDs?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Broke them in half, threw them in the trash.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Sensenbrenner.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. I have no further questions.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Wholley, in addition to your e-mail to Mr.
Morrell,  you  sent  an  e-mail  to  Jeff  Rosen,  the  counsel  at  OMB  for
Clay Johnson.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Dated April 4, 2007.
Mr. WHOLLEY. I do not recall that particular e-mail, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  It  is  in  the  evidence  book  as  Exhibit

18–B, the exhibit book.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Sir, my #18 is——
Chairman MILLER. 18–B.
Mr. WHOLLEY.—the bullet points from——
Chairman MILLER. 18–B. 18–B.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  The  subject  line  is  Hearings  with

two question marks.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Now,  that  was  two  days  after  Senator
Nelson,  Chairman  Gordon,  and  I  called  on  Mr.  Cobb,  called  on
President Bush to fire Mr. Cobb.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. And in the e-mail, you, of course, point
out the subject of the Cobb case, and you wrote that the Cobb case
‘‘continues to spin up to ‘‘escape velocity,’’’’ and ‘‘the reason for this

e-mail is to arrange a meeting between the two us, and anyone else
you care to bring from your staff who has been involved in vetting
this  investigation,  before  there  is  any  hearing,  so  that  we  can  so-
berly  consider  the  approach  to  be  taken.’’  ‘‘I  am  sure  that  you  can
appreciate  that  I  am  not  particularly  keen  on  seeing  two  entities
of the Executive Branch at odds in a hearing before the Legislative
Branch.’’

So,  you  were  aware  that  this  would  likely  be  the  subject  of  Con-

gressional hearings.

ly.

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir. I cannot say I was aware that it was like-

Chairman MILLER. It was possible.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Possible, yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  If  it  was  likely,  there  just  would

have been one question mark. Possible was two question marks.

So, you were certainly very, very aware of the Congress’ interest
in  this,  this  committee’s  interest  in  this,  and  you  were  getting  to-
gether with OMB to kind of get on the same page?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  No,  sir.  My  concern,  which  I  had  expressed  as,
since you have all my e-mails, you know, my concern was that the,
concerning  the  disconnect  between  the  Executive  Order,  the  Integ-
rity  Committee  policies  and  procedures,  and  what  had  actually
been produced and what transpired. That was my concern, not the
hearing,  sir.  I  mean,  you  called  a  hearing.  I  have  given  you  every-
thing that I have on my computer that my counsels, that my attor-
neys  believe  was  relevant.  I  am  here  to  answer  any  question  you
have.  My  concern  was  about  the  way  the  Executive  Order  and  the
policies  and  procedures  were  not  properly  interfacing  in  the  way
that the investigation came to us.

Chairman MILLER. All right. I am sorry. ‘‘I am sure that you can
appreciate  that  I  am  not  particularly  keen  on  seeing  two  entities
of the Executive Branch at odds in a hearing before the Legislative
Branch.’’

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  What  was  it  you  were  concerned  that  OMB

and NASA might be at odds about?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  It  wasn’t  so  much  OMB,  sir.  It  was  the  Integrity
Committee and the PCIE. And it is not OMB. I was talking to Jeff
Rosen,  Mr.  Rosen,  in  his  capacity  as  the  Counsel  to  Clay  Johnson,
Chairman  of  the  PCIE.  He  was  well  aware,  as  were  others,  of  my
concerns  about  the  Executive  Order  and  the  policies  and  proce-
dures, and how they were or were not interfacing properly.

Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  Mr.  Wholley,  could  you  describe
what your role was in the response by Administrator Griffin to the
findings of the PCIE, the report of the PCIE?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  I  was  given  the  package,  sir.  I  was  given  the
package by Mr. Morrell, as I said on, my e-mails reveal it was the
26th. I did review it. I turned it over to someone who knew nothing
about  it,  a  very  experienced  today,  and  asked  for  her  unvarnished
opinion on it.

I  had  her  brief  Dr.  Griffin.  I  was  in  the  room.  At  the  conclusion
of  her  brief,  he  asked  me  my  thoughts.  I  explained  that  I  was  on
all fours with her analysis, which had been done independently. We
had  previously  or  simultaneously  given  him  the  range  of  options.

45

As  you  know,  sir,  he  has  no  disciplinary  options,  which  is  why  his
letter talks in terms of with the concurrence of the Chairman of the
PCIE.

And that was my role, sir.
Chairman MILLER. All right. What was the standard that the at-
torney  that  you  referred  to  used  in  her  analysis?  Was  it  one  of
criminal misconduct, or was it one of appearances?

Mr. WHOLLEY. I believe she would be better able to answer that,
sir,  but  I  do  know  that  she  had  the  policies  and  procedures,  with
the  definitions  therein.  She  had  the  Quality  Standards  for  Inspec-
tors General. She had the Executive Order. She had all of the, she
had  everything  I  had.  And  she  had  a  number  of  years  of  experi-
ence.

Chairman MILLER. And—I am sorry.
Mr. WHOLLEY. I am sorry. I don’t want to speculate. I was going
to say I doubt she used criminal law standards, since any criminal
law  violation,  I  assume,  would  have  been  given  to  the  Justice  De-
partment,  and  as  you  know,  sir,  the  investigation  specifically  says
there  is  no  violation  of  law,  rule,  or  regulation,  gross  misconduct,
or gross waste of funds. They did say there was an abuse of author-
ity in creating a hostile work environment.

MR. WHOLLEY’S RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. COBB

Chairman  MILLER.  Just  one  more  set  of  questions,  Mr.  Wholley.
I  know  in  your  written  statement,  and  perhaps  in  your  oral
statement  as  well,  you  said  that  you  did  not  socialize,  you  do  not
visit with Mr. Cobb in his home. He did not visit in your home. You
did talk whenever you saw each other.

Did  you  have  regular  meetings  with  him  to  discuss  matters  be-

fore your Office or before his Office?

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. And how often was that?
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  I  would  say  probably  it  would  be  rare  that  if

I didn’t see him once every couple of weeks.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Did you——
Mr. WHOLLEY. Probably more. Weekly, ten days.
Chairman  MILLER.  Did  you  tell  our  staff  that  you  met  once  a

week from the time that you joined NASA?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Yes,  sir.  Initially,  we  did  have  weekly  meetings,

when——

Chairman MILLER. All right.
Mr.  WHOLLEY.  There  were  weekly  meetings  between  the  Admin-
istrator,  that  the  parties  that  were  supposed  to  be  at  the  meeting
were  the  Administrator,  Deputy  Administrator,  Chief  of  Staff,  In-
spector  General,  and  General  Counsel.  That  had  existed  before  I
got  there.  More  often  than  not,  the  Administrator  wasn’t  there.  It
was  the  Deputy  Chief,  and  this  was  prior  to  Dr.  Griffin  arriving.
Chairman  MILLER.  All  right.  And  did  the  two  of  you  compare

notes on your discussions with our staff?

Mr. WHOLLEY. No, sir. Compare notes, sir?
Chairman MILLER. Well, that is a phrase. Did you talk with each

other about the interviews?

Mr. WHOLLEY. I think we said something, but it was not, frankly,

it was not what I would consider anything substantive.

46

Chairman MILLER. Okay. And you are familiar with all of the al-
legations,  not  just  the  summary  report,  but  all  of  the  allegations
within the file of the PCIE matter, the Inspector General, began as
an  Inspector  General’s  investigation  by  the  Inspector  General  of
HUD. Have you reviewed all of that?

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Sir,  I  have  reviewed  what  I  was  provided,  what
NASA  was  provided.  I  have  reviewed  that.  I  don’t  know  if  I  have
everything. I was, as I mentioned to your staff, I dealt with the pile
of wood that was given to us.

Chairman MILLER. All right. In, well, allegation 43, in the Record
of  Investigation,  again,  it  is  an  allegation,  was  that  Mr.  Cobb  had
improperly  provided  you  information  pertaining  to  criminal  cases.

Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. You are familiar with that allegation.
Mr. WHOLLEY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  you  are  familiar,  you  know  that
one  of  the  principal  concerns  about  Mr.  Cobb’s  conduct  at  NASA
was  the  inappropriateness  of  his  relationship  with  Sean  O’Keefe,
and how close it appeared to be, rather than an arm’s length inde-
pendence.

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Yes,  sir.  And  again,  I  believe  Mr.  O’Keefe  left  in

February of 2005.

Chairman MILLER. All right. Did you seek advice from Mr. Cobb
on how to manage your own staff, how to lead it, how to deal with
challenges, or did he seek advice from you on those matters?

Mr. WHOLLEY. He did not seek advice from me, no sir.
Chairman MILLER. Did you discuss it?
Mr. WHOLLEY. We discussed leadership at times, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. I have no further questions.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Neither do I.
Chairman  MILLER.  I  thank  both  of  you  for  appearing,  and  for
your  testimony,  and  I  believe  that  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  and  I  have
already discussed further action that we may take. Thank you.

Mr.  WHOLLEY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Miller  and  Mr.  Sensen-
