AND  THE  POTENTIAL  IMPACT  OF 
A  DELTA/NORTHWEST  MERGER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION OPERATIONS, SAFETY, AND 
SECURITY, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:30  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  John  D.  Rockefeller 
IV, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. This hearing will come to order. We have 
a  very  large  crowd  and  two  of  us  at  the  table,  but,  that  is  over-
whelmed  by  the  presence  of  Senator  Isakson  at  the  witness  table. 
Mr. Isakson is not going to make a statement. He is going to make 
an  introduction.  He  is  my  good  friend,  and  I  welcome  whatever  he 
wishes to say. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHNNY ISAKSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA 

Senator ISAKSON. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
About 16 months ago, you gave me the privilege of coming to this 
Committee room and introducing the then-CEO of Delta Air Lines, 
Jerry  Grinstein,  which  I  was  very  proud  to  do.  Delta  was  in—had 
been  in  difficult  straits  and  was  going  through  difficult  times,  and 
I  was  honored  and  privileged  to  be  here  to  introduce  him  to  this 
Committee  because  with  all  the  difficulties  they  had,  they  were 
fighting  to  preserve  the  pension  plan  of  their  loyal  rank-and-file 
employees. 

As a man who owned a business, one who appreciated the value 
of my assets, which were my people, I was very proud to represent 
him  that  day  and  introduce  him.  I  also  had  the  occasion  during 
then  to  meet  Mr.  Steenland  as  well  with  Northwest,  who  also  had 
equally  the  same  commitment  to  their  employees  and  their  work-
ers. 

Today,  it  is  my  privilege  to  introduce  the  new  CEO  of  Delta  Air 
Lines  who  replaced  Jerry  Grinstein.  His  name  is  Richard  Ander-
son. He has 20 years experience in the aviation business with both

Northwest and Continental. And before coming to Delta in 2007, he 
left United Healthcare as one of the leaders in that great company. 
And  I  know  he  shares  the  same  commitment  that  Jerry 
Grinstein  did  for  the  people  of  Delta,  and  I  am  here  to  speak  on 
behalf  of  them,  welcome  him  to  this  Committee,  thank  the  Com-
mittee  for  offering  him  the  chance  to  testify,  and  tell  you  just  how 
proud I am of Delta Air Lines and all of her people. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  We  are  12–14  at  home,  are  we  not,  Sen-

Senator  ISAKSON.  We  are  having  a  little  trouble.  John  Smoltz 

hurt his arm, and Glavine is getting old. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is out of order. 
Senator  ISAKSON.  But  Chipper  Jones  is  hitting  .435.  So  we  are

doing all right. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ISAKSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, sir. 
I  am  going  to  waive  my  statement  because  we  have  a  very  full 
panel, and this is a very crowded day. We are going to be working 
here very late. 

And  next  to  me,  Senator  Hutchison,  who  is  my  Vice  Chair,  has 
to  leave  at  3  p.m.,  and  she  wants  to  just  stay  a  couple  of  minutes. 
Then we are going to have the full panel come and begin the tes-

timony, and then we will start the questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Over the last 5 years, the commercial airline industry has undergone a brutal re-
structuring that cost hundreds of thousands of airline employees their jobs and their 
pensions,  eliminated  and  or  reduced  service  to  countless  small  and  rural  commu-
nities, and changed the very nature of the industry. 

Just  last  year,  we  thought  the  commercial  airline  industry  had  rebounded  suffi-
ciently and had undertaken enough structural reforms to weather the next economic 
downturn. We were wrong. 

The impact of the rising cost of oil barrel threatens the very viability of every air-
line  in  this  country.  Six  carriers  have  already  been  pushed  into  bankruptcy  and 
more teeter on the edge of financial collapse. 

I  know  that  many  of  my  colleagues  will  want  to  focus  exclusively  on  the  pending 
merger  between  Delta  Air  Lines  and  Northwest  Airlines.  But,  I  do  not  want  us  to 
miss the primary point of this hearing—the financial health of the U.S. aviation in-
dustry. 

I spoke at great length last week on this issue. A healthy airline industry is crit-
ical to our entire economic future. And, frankly, too few of us seem not to care. We 
are  losing  our  global  leadership  in  aviation—from  aerospace  research,  to  air  traffic 
control system development, to market share. U.S. airlines are fast becoming second 
tier carriers in the global marketplace. 

Over the last 2 years, I have heard a lot of airline CEOs tell me that they believe 

the airlines must consolidate to achieve long-term financial viability. 

I am not unilaterally opposed to consolidation, as I understand that some consoli-
dation  may  be  necessary  to  make  sure  the  United  States  has  a  financially  stable 
commercial aviation industry. 

Although consolidation may be necessary to make sure we have a healthy airline 
industry,  I  am  not  convinced  that  consolidation  is  sufficient  to  solve  the  long-term 
challenges of the airlines. 

Our  hearing  today  will  allow  us  to  examine  the  current  financial  state  of  the  in-
dustry, the steps that the industry and policymakers must take to achieve financial 
stability in the industry, and the potential impact another round of industry consoli-
dation would have on the industry and the communities and consumers they serve.

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  And  I  beg  my  colleagues’  forbearance  on 
that  authoritarian  act  on  my  part,  but  I  really  am  anxious  to  get 
on with this hearing, we have a large group to hear. 

Senator HUTCHISON. I appreciate that, and I will not read my en-

tire statement. I would like to put it in the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Hutchison follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 
Thank you, Chairman Rockefeller, for holding the hearing today. I would also like 

to welcome our panel of witnesses, including the CEOs of Delta and Northwest. 

As  I  mentioned  to  the  CEOs  when  I  met  with  them  last  week,  I  don’t  like  the 
current  trend  of  mergers  and  consolidation  in  the  industry.  While  I  don’t  intend  to 
block  or  impede  the  process—that  is  not  the  role  of  Congress—I  do  have  concerns 
about the downstream effects of major consolidation. 

I  believe  the  promotion  of  competition  and  an  emphasis  on  consumer  and  pas-
senger concerns should be heavily considered. A bigger airline doesn’t always mean 
a  better  airline,  and  the  creation  of  monopolistic  hubs  will  do  little  to  improve  con-
sumer choice. 

However,  as  economic  conditions  become  more  uncertain  in  the  short-term,  it  is 
important we review the economy’s impact on the aviation sector. Also, airlines such 
as Delta and Northwest are competing in the world market in many places against 
bigger  airlines  with  lower  fuel  costs  because  of  the  low  dollar  exchange  and  some-
times government subsidies. 

Since  the  year  2000,  the  U.S.  airline  industry  has  gone  through  its  most  funda-
mental restructuring since Congress deregulated the industry in the late 1970s. We 
all know so well the horrific impacts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but several other 
variables have led to where the industry finds itself today, notably, record high fuel 
prices. 

In  addition,  the  advent  of  the  Internet  has  made  customers  much  savvier  and 
overall industry trends like aggressive low-cost carriers, international agreement ex-
pansion,  and  bankruptcy  restructuring  have  had  significant  impacts  on  the  face  of 
the industry. 

I am hopeful we can have a discussion today about not only domestic competition 
and  challenges,  but  also  global  competitiveness  and  what  lies  ahead  for  the  indus-
try.  It  is  important  we  understand  the  future  marketplace  in  order  to  make  in-
formed policy decisions. 

Thank you, Chairman Rockefeller, I look forward to the testimony. 

Senator HUTCHISON. But the bottom line is I appreciate that you 
are  calling  the  hearing.  I  know  the  public  wants  to  hear  all  of  the 
points  about  this  potential  merger.  I  have  been  privileged,  really, 
to  meet  with  both  CEOs,  and  I  appreciate  their  coming  to  talk  to 
me. 

In the main, I don’t like the idea of mergers because I think the 
more  competition  we  have,  the  better  it  will  be  for  our  consumers. 
However,  having  said  that,  I  don’t  think  it  is  the  role  of  Congress 
to  step  in  and  actually  try  to  impart  our  policies  on  these  airlines, 
at least not as it refers to mergers. 

And  second,  I  realize  that  there  are  foreign  carriers  with  whom 
these  carriers  and  others  compete,  that  the  foreign  carriers  have 
much lower prices of gasoline because of the dollar differential, and 
that some of them are subsidized by their governments. And there-
fore,  I  do  understand  what  I  am  told  about  the  need  for  a  bigger 
consortia to be able to compete with other foreign big airlines. 

So  I  am  anxious  to  hear  and  read  your  testimony,  but  just  as  a 
policy  for  me,  I’d  like  to  have  more  American  airlines  competing

with each other and giving the consumer the best service and price. 
So  with  that,  let  me  say  thank  you  for  calling  the  hearing,  and  I 
will submit the rest of my statement for the record. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  thank  the  Honorable  Senator  from 
Texas,  who  I  think  wanted  to  say  more.  And  so,  I  appreciate  her 
forbearance. 

If  Mr.  Patrick  Murphy,  Principal,  Gerchick-Murphy  Associates, 
would you come forward along with Mr. Richard Anderson, CEO of 
Delta  Air  Lines;  Mr.  Doug  Steenland,  CEO  of  Northwest  Airlines; 
Ray  Neidl  of  Calyon  Securities;  Ms.  Patricia  Friend,  President  of 
the  Association  of  Flight  Attendants;  Mr.  Robert  Roach,  Inter-
national  Association  of  Machinists;  and  Mr.  Mark  Cooper,  Con-
sumer Federation of America. If you could all come forward. 

Again,  I  apologize  for  the  amplitude  of  people  and  the  lack  of 

space. 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chairman, before any of our witnesses 
testify,  I  want  to  ask  that  a  full  statement  of  mine  be  included  in 
the  record  as  if  it  was  given.  And  I  commend  you,  Mr.  Chairman, 
for  holding  this  hearing.  A  very  important  decision  is  about  to  be 
made, we want to make sure that we wind up with a net improve-
ment  for  the  traveling  public  and  express  our  concern  for  the  em-
ployees that will be affected by the proposed merger. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  thank  the  Senator,  and  I  put  his  state-

ment in the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Mr. Chairman, 
Each day, two million travelers depend on safe and reliable travel options, includ-
ing passenger rail, cars and trucks, and airplanes. Our economy depends on the air-
line  industry—and  so  do  thousands  of  hard-working  pilots,  flight  attendants,  air 
traffic controllers, and other employees. The airline industry was on its way to earn-
ing  a  healthy  profit  this  year,  but  skyrocketing  oil  prices  have  turned  their  profits 
into losses. 

And  with  intense  competition  and  record  fuel  costs,  some  airlines  are  looking  to 
merge  to  keep  their  business  strong.  As  a  former  businessman,  I  understand  that 
merging is often appealing for a company and its employees, especially in tough eco-
nomic  times.  But  through  the  merger  process,  airlines  must  not  neglect  their  cus-
tomers. After all, it’s the customers that are keeping these airline companies in the 
sky. 

Passengers  deserve  quality  customer  service.  Yet  from  ticketing  and  baggage 
problems to flight cancellations, it seems that customer service has been left at the 
gate. To address these issues, we have provided money this year to increase enforce-
ment  of  airline  consumer  rights.  Airline  companies  cannot  mistreat  travelers  with-
out  consequences.  We  must  also  pass  a  passenger  bill  of  rights.  Travelers  deserve 
it. 

Passengers are not the only ones with rights. Employees have rights, too. Airline 
employees  have  made  many  sacrifices  since  9/11  to  keep  this  industry  in  the  air, 
and  airlines  must  treat  their  workers  with  respect.  That’s  why  some  of  my  col-
leagues and I sent a letter to these CEO’s asking that they respect employee rights 
throughout the merger process. 

Lastly, there is more the Federal Government can be doing to help both travelers 
and this industry. 2007 was one of the worst years on record for flight delays: more 
than one in four flights was late. And flights into Newark Liberty International Air-
port were among the most delayed in the Nation.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  regret  to  say  that  the  Bush  Administration’s  short-sighted  poli-
cies in overseeing airline scheduling practices, as well as planning for the future of 
the air traffic control system, have helped create the situation we are in. Air traffic 
controllers  are  being  overworked  and  understaffed,  and  not  enough  has  been  done 
to  reduce  dangerous  and  unnecessary  safety  risks  on  our  runways  and  in  aircraft 
inspections. 

The Administration is not focused on the needs of the flying public, and just yes-
terday  we  were  blocked  on  the  Senate  floor  from  moving  forward  on  a  critical  FAA 
modernization bill. 

Despite  these  challenges,  I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  on  this 
Subcommittee  to  continue  our  efforts  to  oversee  the  problems  at  the  FAA  and  im-
prove our aviation system as we move forward. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  And  so,  Mr.  Patrick  Murphy,  you  have 

the least comfortable seat. 

STATEMENT OF PATRICK V. MURPHY, JR., PARTNER, 

GERCHICK-MURPHY ASSOCIATES, LLC 

Mr.  MURPHY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member 
Hutchison  and  Senator  Lautenberg.  Thank  you  for  allowing  me  to 
testify today. 

I  would  like  to  take  my  few  moments  to  discuss  the  results  of 
studies  which  I  and  my  colleagues,  Randy  Bennett  and  Jack 
Schmidt, have done on airline competition. We believe the analysis 
we have done is the most comprehensive review of competition that 
has been done since September 11, 2001. 

Our fundamental finding is that the U.S. domestic airline indus-
try is more competitive than at any time in history. The key to this 
increased  competition  is  the  emergence  of  two  distinct  business 
models—network  carriers  and  low-cost  carriers.  Each  of  these  two 
business models plays a vital role in serving the public, and neither 
model alone could serve the Nation’s needs. 

Today’s  unprecedented  level  of  competitiveness  is  the  con-
sequence  of  a  sharp  change  in  the  industry  economics  that  can  be 
traced  to  the  year  2000.  In  late  2000,  almost  a  full  year  before  9/ 
11,  the  industry’s  fortunes  changed  radically.  The  airlines  suffered 
the  largest  drop  in  profits  ever  recorded  at  that  time.  At  the  same 
time,  the  network  carriers’  costs  were  escalating  rapidly,  while  at 
the very same moment their unit revenues were plummeting. 

This  dramatic  swing  coincided  with  the  dot-com  collapse,  new 
fare transparency for consumers because of the Internet, and accel-
erating  growth  of  low-cost  carriers.  This  unprecedented  change  in 
the  industry’s  fortunes  started  a  6-year  string  of  losses  that—for 
the  network  carriers  stretched  from  2001  to  2006  and  totaled  over 
$30  billion  in  red  ink.  At  the  same  time,  the  newer  and  faster- 
growing low-cost carriers were profitable every single year. 

The  low-cost  carriers  have  grown  in  size  and  in  market  share 
and in numbers. Between 2000 and 2006, they grew 73 percent. At 
the same time, the network carriers and their regional partners cut 
capacity 13 percent. This is a remarkable development. The legacy 
airlines  have  shrunk  not  only  in  relative  terms,  but  in  absolute 
terms.  And  they  shrunk  again  in  2007,  and  they  will  shrink  again 
in 2008. 

By 2006, the low-cost carriers accounted for 30 percent of all pas-
sengers  in  this  country.  Perhaps  most  importantly,  the  LCCs  now 
compete in markets that account for three quarters of all U.S. pas-

sengers.  This  is  an  absolutely  key  development.  This  means  that 
U.S.  travelers  benefit  by  head-to-head  competition  with  low-cost 
carriers on three quarters of their journeys whether they fly on the 
low-cost carriers or not. 

Meanwhile,  the  network  carriers  have  faced  a  sharp  decline  in 
revenue  derived  from  high-end  fares.  Until  2000,  the  network  car-
riers  were  able  to  segment  their  traffic  into  higher-end  fare  buck-
ets.  That  resulted  in  much  of  their  revenue  coming  from  higher- 
paying  passengers.  That  market  segmentation  strategy  has  now 
collapsed. The network airlines have permanently lost a $12 billion 
annual revenue stream, and it is not coming back. 

As  for  fares,  inflation-adjusted  fares  in  2006  were  20  percent 
lower  than  in  either  1995  or  2000.  Also,  the  practice  of  charging 
higher  fares  for  local  passengers  dominated  hub  city  airports  has 
largely  been  eliminated.  The  dominant  carriers  at  most  large  con-
necting hubs no longer can charge fare premiums. 

On the cost side, we were very surprised to learn that even after 
all the massive cuts made by labor and management, network car-
riers still have significantly higher costs than low-cost carriers. The 
cost  cap  between  network  and  low-cost  carriers  remains  where  it 
was in 1999 at between 40 and 50 percent. 

In  response  to  this  unrelenting  low-cost  competition,  network 
carriers have focused on their core strength, their large connecting 
networks.  They  bundle  traffic  from  all  sizes  of  markets  onto  con-
necting  flights  at  their  hubs.  Low-cost  carriers,  on  the  other  hand, 
continue to expand. But they stress large and medium-sized domes-
tic markets over smaller communities. 

The legacy carriers have pressed their network advantage largely 
in  the  international  market,  where  there  is  little  low-cost  competi-
tion.  They  have  shifted  away  from  intense  head-to-head  domestic 
battles for market share. 

The  network  carriers  also  face  little  low-cost  competition  on 
flights to small U.S. cities. This explains the network carriers’ con-
tinued  focus  on  serving  smaller  markets  with  their  regional  part-
ners.  Network  airlines  serve  more  than  300  of  the  Nation’s  334 
non-hub airports. Low-cost carriers are almost nonexistent at small 
communities.  Consequently,  smaller  cities  rely  almost  exclusively 
on  network  carriers,  and  it  is  fair  to  state  that  network  carriers 
and small communities are now co-dependent on each other. 

Conclusion,  the  network  carriers  returned  to  a  modest  profit  in 
2007.  However,  they  are  once  again  bleeding  red  ink.  Their  long- 
term  prospects  remain  uncertain  as  they  continue  to  lose  domestic 
market share and as foreign competitors grow in size and strength. 
The  network  carriers  are  stuck  in  a  competitive  vise  between  do-
mestic pressure and emerging international pressure. 

For  now,  the  network  carriers  are  finding  the  international  sec-
tor  friendly,  but  that  could  change.  Meanwhile,  the  low-cost  car-
riers  are  scaling  back  their  aggressive  growth,  but  they  are  still 
gaining market share. 

As for the American public, fares and service levels are at a very 
competitive  level,  although  fuel  costs  are  now  reversing  the  long- 
term decline in fare levels. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRICK V. MURPHY, JR., PARTNER, 

GERCHICK-MURPHY ASSOCIATES, LLC 

Chairman  Rockefeller,  Ranking  Member  Hutchinson  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  thank  you  for  the  privilege  of  appearing  before  you  today.  My  name  is 
Patrick Murphy and I am an aviation consultant with over 36 years of aviation eco-
nomic experience both inside and outside of government. 

I would like to present the results of a study on domestic airline competition that 
was  completed  last  year  by  myself  and  two  colleagues,  Randy  Bennett  and  Jack 
Schmidt.  We  are  now  updating  that  analysis.  We  believe  our  study  entitled,  ‘‘A 
Competitive  Analysis  of  An  Industry  in  Transition’’  is  the  most  comprehensive  re-
view  of  the  state  of  airline  competition  that  has  been  performed  since  the  tragic 
events of September 11, 2001. 

We  have  presented  the  results  of  our  findings  in  a  series  of  separate  meetings 
with  numerous  organizations.  Among  the  groups  we  have  briefed  are:  DOT  (twice), 
DOJ Antitrust Division, DOS, FAA, GAO, ATA, NACA, AAAE, ACI, House Aviation 
staff and Senate Aviation staff. 

All three of us who prepared the study are former long-term government aviation 
officials. We therefore prepared our study using data and analytical techniques that 
we used while in the Federal Government. We believe our results are objective, and 
the various government agencies we have briefed seemed to agree. 

Our fundamental finding is that the U.S. domestic airline industry is today more 
competitive  than  at  any  time  since  1995,  the  start  of  our  study  period,  and  almost 
certainly  more  competitive  than  at  any  time  in  history.  The  key  to  this  increased 
competition  is  the  emergence  and  evolution  since  airline  deregulation  30  years  ago 
of two distinct business models—network carriers (also known as the six legacy air-
lines)  and  low-cost  carriers  (LCC’s  such  as  AirTran,  Frontier,  JetBlue,  Southwest 
and Spirit). Each of these two business models plays a vital role in serving the pub-
lic.  Both  business  models  are  key  to  providing  a  comprehensive  and  affordable  air 
transport system, and neither business model alone could serve the Nation’s needs. 
Today’s  unprecedented  level  of  competitiveness  is  the  consequence  of  a  sharp 
change  in  industry  economics  that  can  be  traced  to  2000.  Between  1993  and  early 
2000 the airlines earned record profits. However in late 2000, almost a full year be-
fore  9/11,  industry  fortunes  changed  radically  the  airlines  suffered  the  largest  drop 
in  profits  ever  recorded.  This  loss  was  largely  attributable  to  the  network  airlines, 
whose  costs  were  escalating  rapidly  while  at  the  same  moment  their  unit  revenues 
were  plummeting.  This  dramatic  swing  coincided  with  the  dot.com  collapse,  new 
fare transparency for consumers because of the internet, accelerating growth of the 
LCC’s,  a  new-found  customer  resistance  to  high  fares,  and  new  more  costly  labor 
agreements. 

This  unprecedented  change  in  the  industry’s  fortunes  started  a  6-year  string  of 
record  losses  for  the  network  carriers  that  stretched  from  the  beginning  of  2001  to 
2006, and totaled over $30 billion in red ink. At the same time, the newer and faster 
growing  LCC’s  were  profitable  every  single  year.  This  was  in  stark  contrast  to  the 
six-year period ended in 2000, when most LCCs struggled for survival while the net-
work airlines recorded record profits. 

The  LCC’s  have  grown  in  size,  in  market  share,  and  in  numbers.  They  have  en-
tered  into  both  longer  distance  and  lower  density  markets.  Since  2000  the  LCC’s 
grew 73 percent. At the same time the network carriers and their regional partners 
cut domestic capacity 13 percent. This is a remarkable development. The legacy air-
lines shrunk, not only in relative terms, but in absolute terms. They have continued 
to reduce domestic capacity and are expected to further reduce capacity in 2008. By 
2006  LCC’s  accounted  for  30  percent  of  all  passengers.  Perhaps  most  importantly, 
LCC’s compete in markets that account for  3⁄4 of all U.S. passengers. This is an ab-
solutely  key  development.  This  means  U.S.  travelers  benefit  by  head-to-head  LCC 
price competition on 3⁄4 of their journeys, whether they fly on an LCC or not. 

When  looked  at  by  city-pairs,  which  is  the  matrix  most  frequently  used  as  the 
‘‘relevant  market’’  in  antitrust  reviews,  the  number  of  competitors  in  city-pair  mar-
kets has grown since 1995, and this healthy trend accelerated in 2000. 

Meanwhile the network carriers that 10 years ago dictated the terms of domestic 
competition  have  faced  a  sharp  decline  in  revenues  due  mainly  to  greatly  dimin-
ished  demand  for  higher  fares.  Until  2000  the  network  carriers  were  able  to  ‘‘seg-
ment’’  traffic  into  higher  end  ‘‘fare  buckets’’  that  resulted  in  much  of  their  revenue 
coming from higher paying passengers. That market segmentation strategy has col-
lapsed. Competition from low cost carriers that stress low fares and consumer resist-
ance  to  paying  high  fares  means  that  the  network  airlines  have  permanently  lost 
a  $12  billion  annual  revenue  stream.  Market  segmentation  has  even  been  substan-
tially  reduced  in  markets  where  LCC’s  do  not  compete.  The  loss  of  market  seg-

8 

mentation  alone  could  account  for  the  legacy  carriers’  enormous  losses  through 
2006. 

Inflation  adjusted  fares  in  2006  were  20  percent  lower  than  in  either  1995  or 
2000. Even without adjusting for inflation, fares dropped from 1995 and from 2000. 
For  example,  non-adjusted  fares  in  2006  were  just  about  10  percent  lower  than 
2000. Also, the practice of charging higher fares for local passengers at hub city air-
ports  has  largely  been  eliminated.  The  dominant  carriers  at  most  large  connecting 
hub  cities  no  longer  can  charge  ‘‘fare  premiums’’.  There  are  still  a  very  small  num-
ber of hubs with significantly higher fares for local passengers, but that practice has 
almost been eliminated by ever expanding competition. 

On the cost side, we were surprised to learn that even after the massive cost cuts 
made by labor and management, including a series of painful bankruptcies, network 
carriers  still  have  significantly  higher  costs  than  LCC’s.  The  cost  gap  between  net-
work  and  low  cost  carriers  remains  about  where  it  was  in  1999  at  between  40  per-
cent  and  50  percent.  We  have  found  no  evidence  of  the  ‘‘cost  convergence’’  theory 
that many had anticipated whereby network and LCC carriers would evolve toward 
each other’s cost levels. 

In  response  to  this  unrelenting  lower  cost  competition,  network  carriers  have  de-
vised  new  strategies.  They  have  focused  on  their  core  strength—their  large  con-
necting  networks.  They  bundle  traffic  from  all  sizes  of  markets,  both  domestic  and 
international,  onto  connecting  flights  at  their  hubs.  LCC’s,  on  the  other  hand,  con-
tinue  to  expand  but  they  stress  large  and  medium  sized  domestic  markets  over 
smaller markets. 

The  legacy  carriers  have  pressed  their  network  advantage  largely  in  the  inter-
national  market.  They  have  shifted  away  from  intense  head-to-head  domestic  bat-
tles  for  market  share  with  LCC’s.  They  have  found  the  international  sector  to  be 
more  profitable.  New  foreign  services  not  only  build  profitable  international  traffic 
but  they  also  build  domestic  traffic  that  connects  through  hubs  onto  international 
flights.  Since  2000,  the  domestic  portion  of  international  flights  has  grown  20  per-
cent  for  the  network  carriers,  or  $2.4  billion  per  year  in  added  domestic  revenues. 
Just  as  the  network  carriers  face  little  LCC  competition  on  international  routes, 
they  also  face  little  or  no  LCC  competition  on  flights  to  small,  non-hub  cities.  This 
explains the network carriers’ continued focus on serving smaller markets with their 
regional  partners.  Network  airlines  serve  more  than  300  of  the  Nation’s  334  non- 
hub airports. LCC’s are almost non-existent at these communities as they serve only 
38.  Consequently,  smaller  cities  rely  almost  exclusively  on  the  network  carriers. 
Network carriers now derive over 11 percent of their revenues from their small mar-
kets,  and  this  share  is  growing.  It  is  fair  to  state  that  the  network  airlines  and 
small communities have become codependent on each other. 
Conclusion 

The network carriers returned to very modest profitability in 2007. However, they 
are again losing money and their long-term prospects remain uncertain as they con-
tinue  to  lose  domestic  market  share;  and  as  foreign  competitors  grow  in  size  and 
strength.  To  some  extent  the  network  carriers  are  stuck  in  a  competitive  vise  be-
tween  intense  domestic  pressure  and  emerging  international  pressure.  For  now  the 
network carriers are finding the international sector friendly, but that could change. 
Meanwhile  the  LCC’s  that  have  enjoyed  significant  growth  and  profit  opportuni-
ties  at  home  are  scaling  back  their  aggressive  growth,  but  are  still  gaining  market 
share.  The  LCC’s  are  now  the  dominant  force  in  the  domestic  industry,  and  they 
are the drivers of both growth and price. For them the key to success is to prudently 
manage their growth and not expand beyond their managerial capability. 

As for the American public, fares and service levels are at very competitive levels, 

although fuel costs are now reversing the long-term decline in fare levels. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  honored  to  answer  any 

questions that you or Members of the Subcommittee may have. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much, sir. 
Senator  Klobuchar  will  now  introduce  Mr.  Richard  Anderson, 

Chief Executive Officer of Delta Air Lines. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Actually,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  going  to  in-

troduce the head of Northwest Airlines. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Yes. That is true. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. I was offering you a multiplicity of oppor-

tunities.

Senator KLOBUCHAR. That is OK. One is enough. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  So  then  we  will  just  do  Mr.  Richard  An-

derson without introduction. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Do  you  want  me  to  wait  until  Mr. 

Steenland? 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. No, you go ahead. 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I  just  wanted  to  welcome  Mr.  Steenland, 
the  head  of  Northwest  Airlines,  but  also  all  of  the  employees  that 
are here from Northwest Airlines. 

Northwest  Airlines,  as  you  know,  was  founded  in  Minnesota,  in 
1926 to carry mail for the U.S. Post Office and began the first mail 
service between Minneapolis and Chicago. During World War II, it 
joined the war effort by flying military personnel and equipment to 
Alaska.  And  after  the  war,  it  was  designated  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  as  the  United  States  main  carrier  over  the  North  Pacific. 
And I would also add that I am not just saying this for nostalgia, 
but  to  describe  the  important  role  Northwest  Airlines  has  played 
in our state and continues to play in the economy of Minnesota. We 
are  ranked  number  9  nationally  for  headquarters  of  Fortune  500 
corporations and home to major research university facilities. 

Northwest  provides  nearly  12,000  high-skilled  jobs  in  my  home 
state,  including  trade  in  mechanics,  pilots,  flight  attendants,  and 
the many workers who support its airports and headquarters. And 
I welcome Mr. Steenland today. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  All  right.  Mr.  Steenland,  you  better  go 

ahead. 

STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS M. STEENLAND, CEO, 

NORTHWEST AIR LINES, INC. 

Mr. STEENLAND. All right. I will. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  My  order  of  introduction  is  not  the  same 
as  the  order  which  is  at  the  table,  which  caused  me  to  embarrass 
myself more than Senator Klobuchar. 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Rockefeller.  Thank  you, 

I am Doug Steenland, Chief Executive Officer of Northwest. I ap-
preciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  here  this  afternoon  and  explain 
the  benefits  of  the  recently  announced  merger  between  Northwest 
and Delta and, most importantly, the fact that this merger will not 
lessen competition. 

I would like to acknowledge and thank Senator Klobuchar. Obvi-
ously,  we  are  very  proud  to  be  the  hub  airline  of  Minneapolis/St. 
Paul, and we look forward to continuing to be the region’s most im-
portant  air  carrier,  major  employer,  and  a  good  corporate  citizen 
after the merger is completed. 

The U.S. airline industry is at a crossroads, creating two choices 
for  Northwest.  One  is  to  continue  on  the  road  now  traveled  as  a 
standalone  airline,  being  whipsawed  by  rising  oil  prices  and  I 
would  note  that  oil  closed  yesterday  at  $122  a  barrel,  which  will 
cost  Northwest  over  $1.5  billion  more  this  year  than  last  year  in 
fuel  facing  competition  from  discount  carriers  that  have  now  cap-

Senators.

tured one-third of the U.S. domestic market, and heightened inter-
national  competition  from  large,  well-funded  foreign  airlines  that 
have  been  allowed  to  consolidate  and  are  increasing  service  to  the 
United States under Open Skies agreements. 

The other choice is to merge with Delta to create a stronger sin-
gle  airline  better  able  to  face  these  challenges.  By  combining  the 
complementary  end-to-end  networks  of  two  great  airlines,  we  will 
achieve  substantial  benefits  and  build  a  more  comprehensive  and 
global network. 

Most importantly, the merged airline will be more financially re-
silient  and  stable,  better  positioned  to  meet  customers’  needs,  bet-
ter  able  to  meet  competition  at  home  and  abroad,  and  better  able 
to provide secure jobs and benefits. 

In  this  merger,  importantly,  no  hubs  will  be  closed.  I  would  like 
to  just  emphasize  that  for  a  second.  In  the  United  States,  North-
west  hubs  in  Minneapolis/St.  Paul,  Detroit,  and  Memphis  will  re-
main in full operation. In recognition of the service we provide and 
the value we create and the commitments we have made, we have 
received  strong  civic  support  in  Michigan,  Memphis,  and  in  Min-
neapolis/St. Paul. 

The  merger  will  create  over  a  billion  dollars  in  annual  benefits 
that will help the merged carrier withstand volatile fuel prices and 
cyclical  downturns.  All  of  these  benefits  will  be  achieved  without 
harming  competition.  The  existing  domestic  and  international 
routes of Northwest and Delta are complementary. So the two car-
riers compete only to a minimum extent today. 

Let  us  start  with  international  markets.  The  question  with  com-
petition  internationally  has  been  asked  and  answered  already  by 
the  U.S.  Government.  Recently,  the  United  States  Department  of 
Transportation  tentatively  granted  antitrust  immunity  to  North-
west,  Delta,  Air  France,  and  KLM  and,  in  doing  so,  found  that 
there  would  be  no  reduction  in  competition  over  the  transatlantic 
from  the  combination  of  Delta  and  Northwest.  Northwest  doesn’t 
serve  Latin  America,  a  Delta  stronghold,  and  Delta  has  only  mini-
mal  service  to  Asia,  which,  as  Senator  Klobuchar  pointed  out, 
Northwest has served well since 1947. 

Domestically,  Northwest  routes  are  focused  on  the  upper  Mid-
west while Delta is strong in the South, in the East, and the Moun-
tain West. A very important fact to remember from today’s hearing 
on  competition  is  that  of  the  800  domestic  nonstop  routes  that 
Northwest  and  Delta  today  collectively  fly,  there  are  only  12  over-
lapped nonstop city pair markets. And on the vast majority of those 
12, there exists robust competition. 

The  domestic  airline  industry,  as  Mr.  Murphy  pointed  out,  has 
undergone  a  competitive  sea  change  over  the  past  several  years. 
Low-cost carriers have grown at an average annual rate of 11 per-
cent  since  2000.  Southwest  is  the  largest  domestic  airline  in  the 
United  States  and  carries  more  domestic  passengers  than  any 
other airline. And that will continue to be the case after this merg-
er. 

With this merger, we have achieved our goal of crafting a trans-
action  that  achieves  a  significant  value  for  all  of  our  stakeholders, 
and we have done so without impacting competition. 

Thanks very much.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Steenland follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS M. STEENLAND, CEO, 

NORTHWEST AIR LINES, INC. 

Introduction 

I am Doug Steenland, the Chief Executive Officer of Northwest Airlines. I appre-
ciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  here  today  to  explain  the  benefits  of  the  recently 
announced merger between Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines. 

The  U.S.  airline  industry  is  at  a  crossroads,  creating  two  choices  for  Northwest. 
One  choice  is  to  continue  on  the  road  now  traveled:  being  whipsawed  by  the  high 
price  of  oil;  facing  nationwide  competition  from  discount  carriers  while  unable  uni-
laterally  to  achieve  the  cost  and  revenue  synergies  that  the  merger  will  produce; 
and  struggling  to  remain  competitive  in  the  face  of  heightened  competition  from 
large,  well-funded  foreign  airlines  that  are  increasing  service  to  the  United  States 
following  implementation  of  Open  Skies  agreements  that  have  liberalized  aviation 
markets around the world. 

The other choice is to merge with Delta to create a single global network by com-
bining  the  complementary  end-to-end  networks  of  two  great  airlines.  By  achieving 
substantial cost savings and building a more comprehensive and balanced network, 
the combined company will be more financially resilient, better positioned to satisfy 
customers’  demands,  and  better  able  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  future  at  home 
and abroad. 

From  the  outset,  we  have  promised  that  we  would  consider  a  transaction  only  if 
it benefits all of our key stakeholders. We are confident that we have met this objec-
tive.  Our  customers  and  the  communities  we  serve  will  benefit  because  this  is  a 
merger of addition, not subtraction. Combining the end-to-end networks of two great 
airlines means that Delta/Northwest will serve more U.S. communities and connect 
to more worldwide destinations than any global airline. Our passengers will benefit 
from  direct  service  from  the  United  States  to  all  of  the  world’s  major  business  cen-
ters  in  Asia,  Latin  America,  Europe,  Africa,  and  North  America.  Because  the  net-
works  of  the  carriers  are  complementary,  no  hubs  will  be  closed.  Delta  and  North-
west  are  committed  to  maintaining  service  to  all  points  on  the  combined  network 
In  fact,  in  an  environment  of  rising  oil  prices,  the  new  carrier  will  be  able  to  cap-
italize on combined traffic flows to preserve some routes that otherwise might have 
been cut as economically unsustainable. 

All stakeholders, and our employees in particular, will benefit from the improved 
financial  resiliency  and  better  competitive  positioning  of  the  combined  carrier.  The 
merger will create over $1 billion in annual synergies that will help the new carrier 
withstand volatile fuel prices and cyclical downturns. The proposed combination also 
will  allow  us  better  to  use  Northwest’s  valuable  Pacific  franchise,  better  develop 
both  carriers’  domestic  hubs,  and  better  match  the  right  planes  with  the  right 
routes. Northwest has already integrated many aspects of its technology with Delta 
through the SkyTeam alliance, paving the way for a smooth integration process. 

All  of  these  benefits  will  be  achieved  without  a  substantial  lessening  of  competi-
tion.  The  existing  domestic  and  international  route  networks  of  Northwest  and 
Delta  are  complementary,  so  the  two  carriers  compete  only  to  a  minimal  extent 
today. Of the more than 800 domestic non-stop routes that NW and DL collectively 
fly,  there  are  only  12  non-stop  city-pair  overlaps.  The  vast  majority  of  these  non- 
stop  overlaps  enjoy  substantial  competition  from  other  carriers,  and  all  consumers 
will benefit from the significant cost savings that the transaction will create. 

We  did  not  come  easily  to  the  decision  to  merge  with  Delta.  Northwest  is  proud 
of its long and distinguished history as a stand-alone carrier, and the company has 
made  Herculean  efforts  in  recent  years  to  preserve  its  ability  to  continue  operating 
independently.  As  you  know,  Northwest  filed  for  Chapter  11  protection  in  Sep-
tember  2005.  As  part  of  the  Chapter  11  reorganization  process,  employees  at  every 
level of the organization made substantial sacrifices to insure that Northwest could 
emerge  successfully  from  bankruptcy.  We  saw  the  success  of  this  reorganization  ef-
fort  in  2007  when  Northwest  earned  $760  million  in  profit,  $125  million  of  which 
went  to  our  employees  as  profit  sharing  and  incentive  payments.  Yet,  with  fuel 
prices  at  record  highs  and  amidst  an  economic  slowdown,  we  remain  financially 
challenged.  The  bottom  line  is  that  we  have  achieved  our  goal  of  crafting  a  trans-
action that creates significant value for all stakeholders. The combined company will 
be  more  stable  and  better  positioned  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  future,  both  at 
home and abroad. 

Small communities are among those that stand to gain the most from the merger. 
This  merger  is  particularly  beneficial  for  states  such  as  West  Virginia  and  Min-

nesota  that  have  a  large  number  of  small  communities  that  need  better  access  to 
the  global  marketplace.  In  many  such  cities,  only  one  carrier  currently  provides 
service. But each carrier individually lacks the ability to provide customers the full 
range  of  international  destinations.  Consequently,  a  passenger  in  Hibbing,  MN 
wanting  to  visit  Panama—or  a  Huntington,  WV  passenger  with  business  in 
Nagoya—would have to travel on two different carriers to reach the desired destina-
tion. After the merger, passengers flying these itineraries will benefit from seamless 
service  on  a  single  carrier.  Together,  we  can  provide  better  service  to  all  customers 
across a broad, worldwide network, and these benefits will be delivered with no hub 
or station closings. 

The  testimony  proceeds  as  follows:  Section  I  of  the  testimony  discusses  why  the 
merger of Delta and Northwest is procompetitive and consistent with regulatory re-
quirements.  The  domestic  airline  market  today  is  highly  fragmented  and  will  re-
main  so  post-merger.  Furthermore,  because  this  merger  will  combine  complemen-
tary end-to-end networks, it will result in only 12 domestic non-stop overlaps, none 
of which will cause competitive problems. In addition, the merger presents no inter-
national  competitive  issues.  Section  I  also  examines  how  competition  in  the  airline 
industry  has  been  transformed  since  2000.  Low-cost  carriers  have  changed  the  in-
dustry,  and  technology  has  created  a  transparency  revolution  that  enables  cus-
tomers  to  compare  airline  fares  quickly  and  easily.  These  factors  will  assure  that 
a  combination  between  Delta  and  Northwest  will  not  reduce  competition  or  harm 
consumers. 

Section  II  of  the  testimony  discusses  market  conditions  in  the  airline  industry, 
particularly the effect on network carriers of the dramatic increase in oil prices, the 
slowdown  in  the  economy,  the  Open  Skies  treaty,  and  the  consolidation  of  foreign 
flag  carriers.  These  conditions  require  that  Delta  and  Northwest  respond 
proactively, and the merger accomplishes that goal. 

Section  III  of  the  testimony  explains  how  the  Delta/Northwest  merger  benefits 
U.S.  customers.  The  combined  carrier  will  offer  access  to  more  worldwide  destina-
tions,  accelerate  investments  to  enhance  the  flying  experience,  and  create  the 
world’s  largest  frequent  flyer  program.  Section  II  also  discusses  how  Delta  and 
Northwest are uniquely positioned for a smooth integration process given their past 
coordination as part of the SkyTeam alliance. 

Finally, Section IV explains how the combined carrier will continue to deliver ex-
increased  single-carrier 
ceptional  service  to  U.S.  communities  by  bringing 
connectivity to smaller communities across the Nation. In addition, this section dis-
cusses our commitment to maintaining all current hubs. 
I.  This  Merger  Is  Procompetitive  and  Consistent  with  Regulatory 

Requirements 

The  domestic  airline  market  is  highly  fragmented  and  there  is  little  overlap  be-
tween  the  networks  of  Delta  and  Northwest,  proving  that  a  merger  of  the  two  car-
riers  will  not  substantially  lessen  competition.  The  fundamental  characteristics  of 
the  airline  business  will  continue  to  constrain  any  hypothetical  anticompetitive  ef-
fects  of  the  merger.  Most  notably,  low-cost  carriers  have  achieved  rapid  growth  in 
this  decade,  changing  the  competitive  dynamics  of  the  industry.  In  addition,  new 
Internet  search  tools  have  created  a  transparency  revolution  in  airline  fares  to  en-
able  customers  to  access  low  fares  easily.  Finally,  customers  will  benefit  from  en-
hanced  competition  in  the  industry  as  the  combined  company  becomes  a  stronger 
airline, better able to compete with discount carriers and growing international air-
lines that are now serving more markets in the United States. 
The Domestic Airline Market Is Highly Fragmented 

The  domestic  airline  market  is  not  concentrated;  no  airline  currently  has  greater 
than  a  20  percent  domestic  passenger  share.  Even  post-merger,  a  combined  Delta/ 
Northwest would capture less than 20 percent of the domestic passenger share, and 
Southwest  would  continue  to  have  the  highest  domestic  passenger  share.  (See  Fig-
ure 1).

There Is Very Little Domestic Overlap Between Delta’s and Northwest’s Networks 

There  is  very  little  overlap  between  the  route  systems  of  Delta  and  Northwest. 
Delta  has  a  strong  presence  in  the  East  and  Mountain  West,  whereas  Northwest’s 
domestic route network is focused in the Midwest. As Figure 2 demonstrates, Delta 
and Northwest operate very different domestic route structures. 

Figure 2: Delta and Northwest Carry Distinct Passenger Bases 

The  domestic  overlap  between  the  two  airlines  that  exists  is  minimal  and  raises 
no  competitive  concerns.  Because  Delta  and  Northwest  have  complementary  net-
works, the two carriers provide overlapping non-stop service on only 12 of the more 
than 800 domestic non-stop city-pairs that they collectively fly.

Competitors  offer  connecting  service  through  Chicago 
and  Cleveland;  AirTran  already  serves  both  Detroit 
and  Dayton  (only  57  miles  from  downtown  Cin-

Notes:  1 Northwest  will  launch  service  on  Detroit-Salt  Lake  City  in  June  2008;  2 Delta  will  launch  non-stop 

service on New York-Minneapolis in June 2008. 

As Table 1 demonstrates, Northwest and Delta currently face significant competi-
tion from other non-stop and connecting competitors on most of these routes. In ad-
dition,  other  factors  lessen  potential  antitrust  concerns.  Both  discount  carriers  and 
legacy  carriers  can  easily  enter  routes  and  provide  competing  service,  and  nearby 
airports provide competitive alternatives. Moreover, relatively few passengers travel 
on  these  non-stop  routes;  overall,  passengers  will  derive  benefits  from  the  merger 
far greater than any potential competitive concerns raised by these few overlaps. 
Delta/Northwest Presents No International Competitive Issues 

Finally,  in  the  international  markets,  there  are  no  significant  competitive  con-
cerns.  In  fact,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation,  in  tentatively  approving  the 
joint  application  from  Air  France,  Alitalia,  Czech,  Delta  KLM,  and  Northwest  for 
authority to operate an immunized alliance in transatlantic markets, found no basis 
to  deny  the  request  on  competition  grounds.  In  issuing  its  Show  Cause  Order  on 
April  9,  2008,  the  Department  stated  ‘‘that  the  proposed  alliance  will  not  substan-
tially  reduce  or  eliminate  competition,  provided  that  transatlantic  markets  remain 
governed  by  a  regional  open  skies  agreement  that  promotes  new  entry  regardless 
of  national  borders.’’  The  Department  further  noted,  ‘‘We  see  no  basis  upon  which 
the Joint Applicants could, as a result of this transaction, impose and sustain supra 
competitive  prices  or  reduce  service  levels  below  competitive  levels.’’  (U.S.  Depart-
ment of Transportation, Show Cause Order, Docket OST–2007–28644, Apr. 9, 2008, 
at 13.)

Indeed,  on  an  operating  carrier  basis,  New  York-Amsterdam  is  the  only  inter-
national  non-stop  overlap,  and  recently  granted  antitrust  immunity  permits  North-
west  and  Delta  to  coordinate  their  service  on  this  route  even  in  the  absence  of  a 
merger. Post-merger, the global aviation marketplace will remain intensely competi-
tive; no global carrier—including Delta/Northwest—will have more than a 7 percent 
share of available seat miles. 
Figure 3: No Significant Concerns in International Markets 

The combination of Delta and Northwest increases competition in all international 
regions. The combined carrier will have a broader network closer in scope and depth 
to that which foreign flag carriers already possess, as well as a significant presence 
in  all  key  international  business  markets,  making  it  a  stronger  competitor  against 
the foreign flag airlines. 
This Merger Should be Evaluated on its Own Merit 

Each  merger  needs  to  be  evaluated  on  its  own  merits.  Delta/Northwest  is  a  pro-
competitive  combination  and  that  fact  remains  true  regardless  of  what  else  may 
happen down the road with respect to industry consolidation. Our merger illustrates 
the  fact  that  consolidation  can  result  in  more  cost-efficient  carriers  with  lower  unit 
costs and greater financial stability. To the extent that any further consolidation in-
volves  an  end-to-end  combination  like  ours  and  is  not  predicated  on  hub  closures 
or  ‘‘rationalization,’’  it  could  enhance  competition  in  the  industry.  In  contrast,  a 
merger of carriers with overlapping networks would raise competitive concerns that 
do not arise in the Delta/Northwest transaction. The competitive impacts of each in-
dividual  major  carrier  combination  are  vastly  different—and  it  does  not  follow  that 
if the Department of Justice approved one combination that it should, or would, nec-
essarily approve others. The Department of Justice will evaluate the competitive ef-
fects  of  each  merger  on  its  own  merits  and  has  the  authority  either  to  block  any 
merger  that  would  harm  consumers  or  to  fashion  remedies  to  address  specific  com-
petitive concerns. 
Competition in the Airline Industry Has Been Transformed Since 2000 

Since 2000, low-cost carriers (LCCs) have grown at a rate of more than 10 percent 
annually.  Southwest  Airlines,  an  LCC,  now  carries  the  largest  number  of  domestic 
passengers.  At  the  same  time,  Internet  pricing  engines  and  online  travel  agencies 
have  created  unprecedented  price  transparency,  enabling  passengers  easily  to  find 
the  lowest  fares  for  a  given  itinerary.  Compounding  this  phenomenon,  LCC  adver-
tising has conditioned passengers to expect ultra-low fares. 
Low-Cost Carriers Have Changed the Industry 

In July 2005, the General Accounting Office reported that ‘‘[t]he low cost carriers 
are  really  the  price  setters  and  have  transformed  the  competitive  environment  in 
the  airline  industry.’’  LCCs  are  strong  competitors  and  have  experienced  explosive 
growth.  Since  2000,  LCC  weekly  departures  and  the  number  of  cities  served  by 
LCCs have increased by 60 percent. (See Figure 4.)

Figure 4: The Rapid Growth of LCCs 

16 

LCCs have grown at an average annual rate of 11 percent since 2000 and in 2007 
carried  one-third  of  domestic  passengers.  The  rapid  growth  of  low-cost  carriers  do-
mestically  has  created  new  competition  that  offsets  historical  regulatory  concerns. 
Furthermore,  LCCs  are  increasingly  targeting  business  passengers:  ‘‘Faced  with 
slowing  growth  and  higher  costs,  discount  carriers  like  Southwest  and  JetBlue  Air-
ways Corp. are making a new push for business travelers, adding flights in heavily 
traveled  business  routes  and  even  quietly  offering  companies  special  deals.’’  (‘‘Dis-
count Airlines Woo Business Set,’’ Wall Street Journal, February 19, 2008.). Led by 
Southwest, LCCs will continue exerting pricing pressure on legacy carriers. 

Over  the  past  several  years,  the  major  LCCs  have  been  more  financially  stable 
than  their  legacy  peers.  Indeed,  Southwest  is  the  only  domestic  airline  whose  cor-
porate  debt  is  rated  as  ‘‘investment  grade’’  by  Standard  and  Poors,  a  fact  that 
speaks  both  to  the  financial  challenges  facing  the  domestic  airline  industry  gen-
erally  and  to  the  viability  of  the  large  LCCs.  During  the  last  decade,  substantial 
discount  carrier  growth  has  resulted  in  a  more  competitive  and  fragmented  indus-
try.  Today,  LCCs  serve  all  major  cities,  including  all  legacy  carrier  hubs,  and  are 
expanding into smaller cities. 

Southwest  Airlines  has  continued  to  experience  dramatic  growth  over  the  past 
several years. Since 2000, Southwest has grown at an average annual rate of 9 per-
cent.  Today,  Southwest  carries  more  domestic  passengers  than  any  other  airline. 
Southwest also has been the most successful domestic airline at hedging against ris-
ing  fuel  prices  and  will  continue  to  benefit  from  its  70  percent  fuel  hedge  for  2008, 
and its 55 percent fuel hedge for 2009. 

Southwest  and  other  LCCs  also  command  significant  market  share  as  a  result  of 

recent competitive successes: 

• Southwest:  continues  to  have  the  strongest  balance  sheet  in  the  industry,  with 
a  business  model  built  on  growth  and  expansion;  added  new  non-stop  service 
on  23  routes  in  2007;  initiated  service  at  San  Francisco  International  and  now 
offers  25  daily  non-stop  flights  to  four  cities  and  connecting  flights  to  49  other 
destinations. 

• JetBlue: added new non-stop service on 24 routes in 2007; experienced a 15 per-
cent  increase  in  passengers;  and  received  a  $300  million  cash  infusion  from 
Lufthansa. 

• AirTran: set record traffic levels in 2007, and enjoyed increased load factors and 
enplanements; added new non-stop service on 35 routes; ordered 15 new Boeing 
737s; has added four new domestic destinations since May 2007. 

As  Figure  5  shows,  LCCs  have  accomplished  this  dramatic  growth  during  the 

same period in which legacy carriers have shrunk.

LCCs  will  continue  to  provide  pricing  discipline  across  the  board.  Entry  in  this 
business  is  wide  open.  There  are  plenty  of  airport  gates  available,  and  airplane 
manufacturers have always been ready to finance airplane deliveries. 

In  recent  weeks,  some  smaller  LCCs  have  gone  out  of  business  and  Frontier  Air-
lines  recently  filed  for  Chapter  11  protection.  Nonetheless,  competition  from  the 
large  LCCs  remains  strong.  In  an  April  11,  2008  report,  Credit  Suisse  rated 
AirTran, JetBlue, and Southwest as ‘‘outperform.’’ 
Technology Has Created a Transparency Revolution 

Over the past several years, online sites such as Orbitz, Expedia, and Travelocity 
have  been  created  to  enable  customers  to  compare  airline  offerings  directly.  (See 
Figure 6, depicting flight options from Cincinnati to Detroit as listed on Orbitz.com). 
These  tools  have  provided  enormous  benefits  to  consumers  and  have  increased  the 
price-competitiveness  of  the  airline  industry.  In  fact,  there  are  few  businesses  in 
which there is as much pricing transparency.

A consumer can log on to the Internet and, at the push of a button, review choices 
available across a wide variety of carriers. That same customer easily can sort those 
choices to find the lowest available fare and view extraordinarily competitive prices 
for both non-stop and connecting flights. For example, the Orbitz.com screen in Fig-
ure 6 displays competing one-stop connections on U.S. Airways, Continental, United 
Airlines, and American for the Cincinnati-Detroit route. 

Over  the  last  several  years,  online  travel  sites  have  developed  advanced  search 
functions such as flexible-date airfare searching and route-specific e-mail fare alerts. 
Furthermore,  sites  such  as  Expedia,  Orbitz,  Travelocity,  and  numerous  others  pro-
vide  their  advanced  pricing  information  and  functionality  to  customers  free  of 
charge.  Even  business  travelers  now  seek  discount  fares  and  travel  sites  such  as 
Expedia Corporate Travel and Travelocity Business have evolved to target business 
customers. 

In sum, customers have become far more sophisticated at comparing the offerings 
of competing carriers, and airline consumers have more tools at their disposal than 
do consumers in the vast majority of industries in the United States. As The Econo-
mist stated in June 2007, ‘‘[t]he web has made it possible for passengers to be their 
own  travel  agents  by  comparing  fares  and  schedules  and  booking  flights—and  at 
prices  much  lower  than  a  decade  ago.’’  (‘‘Fear  of  Flying,’’  The  Economist,  June  14, 
2007.)  As  online  technology  continues  to  evolve,  airfare  transparency  will  continue 
to be enhanced. 
II. Market Conditions Require Change in the Airline Industry 

Significant  economic  pressures  from  record  fuel  prices  and  intense  competition, 
particularly from discount carriers and foreign airlines based in Europe, the Middle 
East, and Asia, have fundamentally changed the airline industry. This new environ-
ment has resulted in diminished profits, restructurings, more than 150,000 lost jobs, 
and financial losses of over $29 billion among U.S. network carriers since 2001. 
Oil Prices Have Increased Dramatically And Continue to Rise 

Record  fuel  prices  have  fundamentally  changed  our  economics,  forcing  airlines  to 
cut  routes  and  reduce  capacity  and  jobs.  Over  the  last  5  years,  the  price  of  oil  has 
increased at an annualized rate of 28 percent, now exceeding $115/barrel. (See Fig-
ure  7.)  And  the  price  of  crude  oil  has  risen  by  nearly  75  percent  over  the  past  12 
months alone. In addition, the crack spread for jet fuel has risen to $29.06 in April 
2008—the highest level ever, even compared to the post-Katrina crack spread spike. 
Figure 7: Daily Oil Prices ($ per Barrel) 

Through the restructuring efforts of the past few years, Delta and Northwest have 
achieved  the  lowest  mainline  non-fuel  cost  of  the  full-service  network  carriers.  Re-
structuring  required  substantial  sacrifices  by  our  employees  in  terms  of  lost  posi-

19 

tions, reduced pay, and reduced benefits. Our employees have made those sacrifices 
to give Northwest a chance to survive and grow. 

Yet, given the rapid fuel increases over the past few years, we remain financially 
challenged.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2008  alone,  we  spent  $445  million  more  on 
fuel to operate virtually the same planes flying the same routes. We anticipate hav-
ing to spend over $1.4 billion more for fuel this Fiscal Year than we did during the 
previous Fiscal Year due to price effects alone. And while it may seem that airlines 
are  continuously  raising  fares  to  share  these  increased  costs  with  consumers,  the 
reality  is  that,  thus  far,  consumers  have  covered  significantly  less  than  our  incre-
mental  fuel  cost  increases.  Today,  fuel  is  the  single  highest  expense  of  Delta  and 
Northwest, significantly eroding the benefits of restructuring. Northwest recently re-
ported  a  net  first  quarter  2008  loss  of  $191  million  (excluding  impairment  charges 
and losses related to marking-to-market fuel contracts that settle in future periods) 
compared to a $73 million profit for the quarter last year. This difference represents 
a swing of $264 million from a year ago. 

Because  Delta  and  Northwest  have  already  gone  through  bankruptcy  and  dra-
matically  lowered  costs,  both  carriers  face  fewer  opportunities  for  further  cost-cut-
ting  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  For  example,  we  have  assured  our  employees  that  we 
will  not  ask  them  for  any  additional  pay  cuts.  The  significant  synergies  of  this 
transaction  enable  Delta  and  Northwest  to  offset  more  effectively  the  dramatic  in-
crease  in  fuel  costs  in  a  way  we  could  not  achieve  individually.  In  short,  the  com-
bination  of  Delta  and  Northwest  creates  a  company  with  a  more  resilient  business 
model  that  can  withstand  volatile  fuel  prices  more  effectively  than  either  could  on 
a stand-alone basis. 
Open  Skies  and  Consolidation 

the  Global  Market  Have  Substantially 

in 

Strengthened the Competitive Position of Foreign Flag Carriers 

Competition  is  growing  from  foreign  airlines  based  in  Europe,  the  Middle  East, 
and Asia as Open Skies agreements and mergers are making foreign airlines strong-
er competitors. The Open Skies agreement between the United States and the Euro-
pean Union, effective last month, has expanded aviation markets around the world. 
Now  any  European  or  U.S.  airline  can  fly  between  any  city  in  the  European  Union 
and  any  city  in  the  United  States,  giving  European  carriers  greater  access  to  U.S. 
markets.  Open  Skies  increases  competition  between  European  carriers  and  highly 
fragmented  U.S.  legacy  carriers.  Foreign  flag  carriers  have  been  able  to  invest  in 
new  aircraft  and  improved  service  offerings  and  amenities  because  they  have  not 
been confronted with the same economic challenges facing U.S. carriers and because 
they pay their fuel bills with stronger currencies. 

Delta/Northwest  creates  a  global  carrier  with  a  first-rate  international  network, 
positioning  the  new  carrier  to  compete  effectively  against  foreign  airlines.  This 
international  expansion  could  not  be  undertaken  organically.  Northwest  could  not 
establish a European and Latin American presence to rival Delta’s without substan-
tial  fleet  expenditures  and  the  renegotiation  of  restrictive  bilateral  agreements  in 
Latin  America.  A  Delta/Northwest  merger  permits  Northwest  customers  to  access 
Delta’s extensive European and Latin American networks in a cost-efficient way. 

Similarly, Delta could not unilaterally recreate Northwest’s significant Asian pres-
ence  because  of  restrictive  bilateral  agreements,  slot  constraints,  and  the  need  for 
substantial fleet expansions. Northwest and United, alone among U.S. carriers, pos-
sess grandfathered rights under the 1952 U.S.-Japan bilateral that afford extensive 
access to Japanese markets and the ability to connect passengers through Japan to 
other  markets  in  Asia.  A  Delta/Northwest  merger  will  allow  Delta’s  customers  to 
benefit from greater access to Northwest’s three Japanese markets and eleven other 
Asia/Pacific markets. 

Combining  the  complementary  international  networks  of  Delta  and  Northwest 
creates  the  comprehensive  global  network  that  customers  value.  By  consolidating, 
Delta  and  Northwest  will  be  able  to  compete  more  vigorously  and  effectively  with 
foreign competition. 
III. Delta/Northwest: A Win for American Customers 

Combining  Delta  and  Northwest  will  offer  customers  greater  choice,  more  com-
petitive  fares,  and  a  superior  travel  experience.  The  combined  airline  will  provide 
convenient connections between more destinations in the United States and around 
the  world  than  any  other  airline.  As  a  stronger,  more  financially  stable  company, 
the combined airline will be more able to reinvest in upgrading its fleet and enhanc-
ing the services that make flying more convenient and enjoyable for customers. 
The Combined Carrier Will Offer More Choices Worldwide Than Ever Before 

The  combined  carrier  will  offer  a  true  global  network.  The  new  carrier  will  offer 
service to over 390 worldwide destinations in 67 countries, including more than 140

20 

small communities across America. Customers also will have access to 840 destina-
tions in 162 countries through the SkyTeam Alliance. 

Combining the networks of Delta and Northwest also paves the way for new route 
offerings.  For  example,  Northwest  Airlines  is  the  preeminent  U.S.  airline  serving 
routes between the United States and Asia, particularly Japan. However, our Asian 
network would be better utilized if it were connected to a domestic network of larger 
scale.  For  example,  several  years  ago,  Northwest  discontinued  service  from  Tokyo 
to New York because we did not have enough of a presence in New York to sustain 
that  route.  Delta,  in  contrast,  has  a  strong  presence  in  New  York.  The  combined 
passenger  volume  of  the  two  carriers  will  support  re-entering  the  non-stop  JFK- 
Tokyo route. 
Delta/Northwest Will Create the World’s Largest Frequent Flyer Program 

The  merger  will  create  the  world’s  largest  frequent  flyer  program.  Because  cus-
tomers will be able to fly to more destinations and enjoy enhanced schedule options, 
they will have more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles. Members 
of the existing frequent flyer programs of both Delta and Northwest will keep their 
current mileage and customer status post-merger. 
Delta and Northwest Are Uniquely Positioned for a Smooth Integration Process 

Delta’s and Northwest’s complementary networks and common membership in the 
SkyTeam alliance will minimize the integration risk that has complicated some air-
line  mergers.  The  carriers’  frequent  flyer  programs,  customer  lounges,  airline  part-
ner  networks,  and  IT  platforms  already  have  been  partially  integrated  through  the 
SkyTeam  alliance  in  which  both  Delta  and  Northwest  participate.  Thus,  the  car-
riers’  previous  investments  in  integration  will  allow  for  a  more  efficient  and  seam-
less integration process. 

Heightened  cooperation  scheduled  to  occur  in  the  transatlantic  will  further  en-
hance  the  integration  process.  Last  month,  the  Department  of  Transportation  pre-
liminarily  granted  antitrust  immunity  for  a  four-way  joint  venture  among  North-
west, Delta, Air France, and KLM. The combination of Delta and Northwest will fa-
cilitate an accelerated implementation of this joint venture, creating significant ben-
efits for consumers. 

We have already commenced a transition planning process to ensure a smooth in-
tegration.  A  task  force  has  been  established  including  senior  leadership  from  all  of 
the  key  operational  departments  of  both  companies.  The  task  force  has  as  its  man-
date to identify the best systems and best processes—so that immediately after clos-
ing we will be in a position to proceed with integrating the companies. 
IV.  Delta/Northwest  Will  Continue  to  Deliver  Exceptional  Service  to 

American Communities 

Because Delta and Northwest bring together complementary route networks with 
only  minimal  service  overlaps,  the  combined  company  will  preserve  all  of  its  hubs 
and serve more domestic and international destinations than any other airline. The 
new  carrier  will  continue  Delta’s  and  Northwest’s  proud  traditions  of  providing  ex-
tensive service to small and rural destinations across the country. By combining, we 
will build on this decades-long history by providing small communities with service 
to  hubs  from  which  they  will  be  able  to  directly  connect  to  an  even  wider  array  of 
destinations on a single airline. 

In  the  first  half  of  2008  alone,  record  fuel  prices  have  forced  the  industry  to  re-
duce  by  more  than  1.6  million  the  number  of  seats  available  to  passengers.  By  the 
end of the year, Delta will have cut capacity by 10 percent, and Northwest by 5 per-
cent.  The  merger,  by  producing  a  stronger  competitor,  will  make  service  cutbacks 
less likely than if Delta and Northwest were to remain separate. 
The Combined Carrier Will Make Service to Smaller Communities More Secure 

We take our commitment to serve customers in small communities very seriously. 
Together,  Delta  and  Northwest  will  serve  over  140  small  communities,  nearly  dou-
ble the amount of our next largest competitor. 

By  aligning  our  network  strengths,  we  can  enhance  service  from  small  commu-
nities  to  new  international  destinations.  Indeed,  48  Northwest  small  communities 
will gain better access to 83 Delta international destinations. Post-merger, over 390 
global destinations will be available on a single airline to each small community we 
serve,  up  from  250  on  Northwest  alone  and  327  on  Delta  alone.  Businesses  in  the 
upper  Midwest  will  gain  access  to  South  America  and  expanded  access  to  Europe, 
while  businesses  in  the  Southeast  will  gain  better  connectivity  to  Asian  markets. 
Potential  new  economic  development,  trade,  and  tourism  benefits  from  enhanced 
global  access  to  and  from  cities  and  towns  across  the  United  States  will  arise  due 
to the merged company’s unprecedented international network. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

21 

Furthermore, the cost savings achieved by the merger will enable the new carrier 
to  continue  serving  routes  that  the  stand-alone  carriers  would  have  had  to  cut. 
Thus, the merger creates a more stable and secure platform for service in an airline 
environment  plagued  by  volatility.  By  combining,  Delta  and  Northwest  will  make 
existing service to small communities more secure. 
All Hubs Will Be Maintained 

The  Delta/Northwest  network  formed  by  our  seven  geographically  balanced  U.S. 
hubs  is  the  combined  carrier’s  greatest  asset.  We  have  no  intention  of  dismantling 
any  hubs,  and  have  committed  to  maintaining  Atlanta,  Cincinnati,  Detroit,  Mem-
phis,  Minneapolis/St.  Paul,  New  York-JFK,  and  Salt  Lake  City.  These  hubs  do  not 
exist  because  they  were  selected  at  random  by  an  airline  planner  throwing  darts 
at a map. They exist because there was a strong local market that justified the de-
velopment of hub service, and an air carrier with the resources to develop it. 

Delta and Northwest made different—but sound—business decisions in developing 
hubs in the cities where they exist today. Furthermore, each hub has unique service 
points, which add value to the hub and to the network. (See Figure 8). 
Figure 8: Unique Regional Service Points 

The merger provides the opportunity for Delta and Northwest to make better use 
of  their  hub  infrastructure  investments  by  generating  additional  traffic  flows 
throughout  the  broader  combined  network.  Because  this  is  an  end-to-end  merger 
and  because  sound  economics  underlie  our  hub  operations  today,  there  is  no  need 
for hub closures. 
Detroit (DTW) 

Detroit  is  Northwest’s  largest  hub  and  will  continue  to  serve  as  Delta’s  premier 
hub  in  the  Great  Lakes  region  with  connections  across  the  globe.  The  state-of-the- 
art  McNamara  terminal,  combined  with  vast  airside  capacity,  provides  an  efficient 
connecting  complex  that  has  won  high  acclaim  with  consumers.  Detroit’s  northern 
tier  geography  (which  is  shared  by  Minneapolis)  places  it  along  the  optimal  great 
circle path for service from many U.S. cities to points in both Asia and Europe. 

Even  though  Detroit  is  a  large  hub  with  extensive  service  throughout  the  heart-
land  region,  Detroit  has  relatively  few  flights  to  the  Southeastern  United  States, 
where  Delta  provides  comprehensive  network  coverage,  and  Detroit  has  no  service 
to  South  America,  where  Delta  is  a  major  player.  Customers  in  Detroit,  and  espe-
cially  the  unique  cities  served  in  Detroit’s  large  Midwest  catchment  area,  will  ben-
efit  from  access  to  the  Delta  network.  In  terms  of  domestic  ASM’s,  Northwest  de-
votes  49  percent  of  its  capacity  to  the  North  Central  region,  and  just  17  percent  to 
the  Southeast.  Conversely,  Delta  offers  only  10  percent  of  its  capacity  in  the  North 
Central  region,  and  39  percent  in  the  Southeast.  Combined,  the  respective  hubs  of 
Delta and Northwest form a better balanced nation-wide network.

Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP) 

The added traffic from Delta’s larger U.S. domestic network will help to strength-
en and promote the development of Northwest’s Minneapolis/St. Paul hub, including 
its  international  services.  Northwest  recently  added  non-stop  service  from  MSP  to 
London  Heathrow  and  Paris.  Delta  is  a  major  player  in  Europe,  and  the  deepening 
partnership  with  our  common  SkyTeam  partners  Air  France  and  KLM  will  con-
tribute  to  the  long-term  success  and  development  of  non-stop  international  services 
from  MSP.  We  are  committed  to  retaining  significant  airline  jobs,  operations,  and 
facilities in the Twin Cities, and the combined carrier will continue to be an impor-
tant part of the Minneapolis/St. Paul community. 
Memphis (MEM) 

Memphis  will  continue  to  play  an  important  role  for  the  combined  carrier.  Mem-
phis  is  a  smaller  but  efficient  and  well-performing  hub.  The  demand  for  air  travel 
to and from Memphis—which has sustained a major airline hub for more than three 
decades—is not going to disappear simply because there is a neighboring Delta hub 
330  miles  to  the  East  at  Atlanta  (ATL).  Northwest’s  Memphis  hub  has  existed 
alongside  Delta’s  Atlanta  hub  since  its  inception,  and  the  merger  is  not  cause  for 
its elimination. By coordinating and optimizing schedules across the complementary 
multi-hub network, the new carrier can improve operating results and offer greater 
frequency and better routing choices for its customers. Memphis provides an impor-
tant opportunity for future growth when economic circumstances permit. Even with 
its fifth runway, Atlanta is operating at capacity. Memphis is a flexible and less con-
gested alternative hub. 
Conclusion 

Northwest  Airlines  has  carefully  considered  the  effect  of  this  transaction  on  our 
shareholders,  our  employees,  our  customers,  and  the  communities  we  serve.  We 
have concluded that the merger is a win for each of these stakeholders in our com-
pany.  This  merger  is  about  paying  employees  fair  wages,  reinvesting  in  new  prod-
ucts  and  services  for  customers,  earning  a  return  for  shareholders  who  have  com-
mitted their capital, and being a good corporate citizen. An unprofitable airline can-
not do any of these things. 

The combination of Delta and Northwest will offer customers greater choice, com-
petitive  fares,  and  a  superior  travel  experience.  It  will  maintain  all  of  Delta’s  and 
Northwest’s hubs and serve more domestic and international destinations than any 
other  airline,  including  service  to  more  than  140  small  communities  in  the  United 
States. 

At this time, I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Steenland, very much. 
Mr.  Anderson,  you  have  already  been  introduced,  and  we  wel-

come your comments.

This  is  really  the  opportunity  for  the  U.S.  airline  industry  to 
compete on a global basis. When you think about what is going on 
in  the  world  today  and  where  commerce  is  today  with  the  various 
free  trade  agreements  and  all  of  the  Open  Skies  agreements  that 
have been signed, we really—it is not just about competition in the 
United  States.  It  is  about  having  strong  U.S.  airlines  to  compete 
around the world. 

When  we  look  at  the  traffic  in  the  United  States  today,  the  ma-
jority  of  the  traffic  carried  to  and  from  Asia,  Europe,  the  Middle 
East,  and  Africa  is  carried  on  foreign-flag  carriers.  Only  5  percent 
of  the  wide  body  international  orders  worldwide  are  held  by  U.S. 
airlines. And most of those are held by these two airlines. 

So  when  you  look  at  our  competitive  position  versus  foreign-flag 
airlines  and  the  fact  that  so  much  of  our  commerce  as  a  country 
depends  upon  our  ability  to  compete  internationally,  it  is  very  im-
portant that we have a strong, viable, competitive airline business, 
and  this  combination  is  about  placing  the  U.S.  airline  industry  at 
the front of international competition. 

When  we  look  out  at  the  other  challenges  that  we  face,  in  addi-
tion to global competition, you cannot ignore the effect that oil has 
on  this  business.  Oil  today  is  actually  at  $123  a  barrel  with  crack 
spreads  at  $30.  So  the  industry  is  paying  on  an  unhedged  basis 
over $150 a barrel for fuel, which represents 40 cents of every dol-
lar we collect. 

In  order  for  us,  for  these  two  carriers  to  be  able  to  do  right  by 
our employees, right by our shareholders, right by the communities 
we  serve,  we  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  act  on  our  own. 
We aren’t here asking you for aid or any other sort of support. We 
are  here  telling  you  that  we  want  to  combine  these  two  great  air-
lines  so  that  we  can  be  much  stronger  and  much  more  durable  so 
that  we  won’t  relive  what  has  happened  over  the  past  7  years, 
which  is  reduction  of  over  150,000  employees  and  losses  totaling 
$30 billion. 

The  oil  prices  alone,  when  I  testified  last  before  the  Senate  2 
weeks  ago,  there  had  been  five  carriers  that  had  entered  Chapter 
11.  There  are  now  six  carriers  that  have  entered  Chapter  11.  And 
what  this  really  does  for  these  two  carriers,  these  are  the  two 
strongest carriers from a balance sheet perspective, a cost perspec-
tive among the network carriers. 

We  have  both  been  through  reorganization.  We  have  both 
scrubbed  our  fleets.  We  scrubbed  our  cost  structure.  We  fixed  our 
balance  sheets.  We  have  solid  strategies,  and  the  opportunity  we 
have  together  by  putting  these  two  airlines  together  with  little,  if 
no  overlap  is  to  build  a  worldwide  network  that  can  compete  on 
any basis with foreign-flag carriers. 

The  merger,  most  importantly,  provides  more  stability  for  our 
employees. When we look at what our standalone plans are versus 
what  the  combination  creates,  the  combination  creates  over  a  bil-
lion dollars in value. The only true stability in this business for our 
employees is for us to have a winning strategy as an enterprise. 

So  we  had  that  in  mind  when  we  put  this  combination  together. 
So we are not—this is end-to-end, so there are no hub closures. We 
have  committed  to  no  layoffs  of  frontline  employees.  We  have  set 
aside  a  significant  amount  of  ownership,  straight  stock  ownership

for  the  employees  on  closing.  We  have  seniority  protection  in  the 
merger agreement. But more importantly, the Congress passed leg-
islation  supporting  it,  and  our  board  of  directors  at  Delta  has 
adopted it as an enforceable policy. 

Small and large communities benefit. Hub and spoke carriers are 
built  to  serve  small  communities.  We  have  invested  hundreds  of 
millions of dollars in the airplanes and the facilities and the sched-
ules  to  provide  that  service.  Discount  carriers  do  not  serve  small 
communities. 

A stronger network carrier will do a better job serving small com-
munities.  We  will  create  new  service  to  over  3,000  markets  and 
over  6,000  new  international  markets.  We  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity  to  be  here  today  and  look  forward  to  answering  your  ques-
tions. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Anderson follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD H. ANDERSON, CEO, DELTA AIR LINES, INC. 

Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  pro-
viding  me  with  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Subcommittee  about  a  topic  that  is 
critical  to  the  future  of  every  employee  of  Delta  Air  Lines,  and  Northwest  Airlines. 
On  April  14,  we  announced  the  merger  of  Delta  and  Northwest;  a  transaction  that 
will  create  America’s  premiere  global  airline.  This  transaction  comes  at  a  unique 
and  important  time  in  the  history  of  the  airline  industry  and  our  two  companies. 
The  world  is  changing  rapidly;  business  is  conducted  across  all  parts  of  the  globe 
and people around the world have unprecedented freedom and opportunity to travel 
abroad.  The  question  facing  the  domestic  airline  industry  is  whether  we  will  have 
companies  with  the  global  network  and  financial  stability  to  compete  in  this  new 
world  against  foreign  carriers.  Make  no  mistake  about  it;  we  face  formidable  com-
petitors  from  overseas.  Today  foreign  flag  carriers  carry  more  passengers  to  and 
from the U.S., Europe and Asia than U.S. flag carriers. They are frequently funded 
by  their  governments  and  benefit  from  regulatory  policies  that  promote  consolida-
tion into a handful of strong competitors. The Open Skies agreements that recently 
have  gone  into  effect  offer  domestic  carriers  excellent  opportunities  and  daunting 
challenges as transatlantic competition will increase dramatically. The current order 
book  for  wide  body  Boeing  and  Airbus  aircraft  shows  that  U.S.  carriers  make  up 
only about 5 percent of the buyers. We do not come here today looking for financial 
support,  but  we  are  looking  for  an  opportunity  to  build  a  more  financially  stable 
U.S. airline with the global presence to compete with foreign carriers.

Our ability to remain strong financially and to compete internationally is severely 
impacted  by  the  unprecedented  rise  in  the  price  of  oil.  Continued  prices  of  $115– 
$120 per barrel of oil will result in bankruptcy for some carriers and deny even the 
most financially sound carriers of profitability. In the last few weeks alone we have 
seen  five  U.S.  carriers  go  into  bankruptcy  directly  as  a  result  of  fuel  prices,  with 
four of them shutting down completely. Passenger airlines reported first quarter re-
sults and the industry reported a $1.74 billion loss for the quarter compared to prof-
its  for  the  first  quarter  of  2007,  with  the  swing  almost  exclusively  the  result  of  in-
creased  fuel  costs.  We  have  seen  the  impact  of  bankruptcies  on  airline  employees 
and customers. Since 2001, U.S. network carriers have shed more than 150,000 jobs 
and  lost  more  than  $29  billion.  The  management  of  Delta  and  Northwest  believe 
that this merger will create a financially stronger airline, with a broad and diversi-
fied global route network that will help it weather the impact of fuel prices and the 
volatility of the domestic and world economies. 
The  Delta-Northwest  Combination  Will  Be  a  Strong,  U.S.  Based  Global 

Competitor 

The  combination  of  Delta  and  Northwest  will  create  a  stronger  company  with 
route  systems  that  complement  each  other  and  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  offer 
travelers a global network that neither airline independently could offer. Northwest 
for  decades  has  been  America’s  premiere  carrier  to  Asia;  in  fact  it  is  the  only  U.S. 
carrier with a hub in Japan that provides a convenient point to connect to the most 
important  destinations  in  Asia.  As  a  result  of  restrictions  in  bi  lateral  agreements 
between  the  U.S.  and  Japan,  there  is  little  chance  that  Delta  would  ever  be  able 
to offer comparable service. Conversely, Delta has invested substantially in building 
the  leading  service  to  Europe,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  from  the  U.S.,  as  well 
as  a  strong  presence  in  Latin  America.  It  is  virtually  impossible  for  Northwest  to 
devote  the  capital  necessary  to  acquire  the  planes  to  build  such  a  franchise.  As  I 
indicated,  the  recent  Open  Skies  agreements  will  permit  any  U.S.  or  European 
Union carrier to fly between the U.S. and the 27 EU member states. Already, Brit-
ish Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Ryanair have indicated that they will add or start 
new  service  between  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  and  Lufthansa  is  a  growing  presence  in 
the  U.S.  The  combined  Delta/Northwest  will  generate  approximately  $  1  billion  a 
year in synergies and will have about $7 billion of liquidity together with the global 
route network that will allow us to compete in this new environment.

The  Merger  Has  Been  Structured  to  Provide  Stability  and  Benefits  for 

Employees 

Delta has a uniquely cooperative relationship with its employees, and in planning 
this  merger  the  impact  on  employees  was  uppermost  in  our  minds.  I  have  worked 
at  many  companies,  in  many  different  jobs,  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors 
and  I  have  never  seen  an  employer  that  respects  and  cares  about  its  employees 
more  than  Delta  Air  Lines.  Delta  historically  has  had  a  culture  that  always  tries 
to  do  what  is  best  for  its  people.  That  is  particularly  important  in  view  of  the  im-
mense challenges that Delta and the rest of the airline industry have faced in recent 
years.  Given  these  industry  challenges,  I  believe  it  is  even  more  important  that  we 
work  collaboratively  with  all  of  our  people  so  that  we  can  fight  and  overcome  them 
together.  As  we  are  beginning  to  see,  companies  and  employees  that  fail  to  work 
together  are  at  greater  risk  of  failure.  We  believe  it  is  important  that  any  trans-
action  we  undertake  will  benefit  the  people  of  both  companies,  together  with  our 
customers  and  other  stakeholders.  We  believe  that  if  we  take  care  of  our  people, 
they will take care of our customers, and we will all benefit. 

Here are just some examples of how this merger will benefit our people: 

a. We will set aside sufficient equity so that all employees can have an unprece-
dented equity stake in the merged company. 
b. We will move all employees, over time, up to industry standard pay and ben-
efits. 
c.  We  will  honor  our  commitment  to  all  U.S.-based,  frontline  employees  to  pro-
vide  a  process  for  the  integration  of  seniority  in  a  fair  and  equitable  manner. 
d. We will maintain the existing pension plans of both companies, both for cur-
rent employees and for those already retired. 
e.  We  will  maintain  our  top  tier  profit-sharing  plan  and  operational  rewards 
program. 
f.  We  have  assured  our  frontline  people  that  there  will  not  be  any  involuntary 
furloughs as a consequence of the merger. 
g.  And  particularly  important  in  view  of  the  impact  on  our  industry  of  record 
fuel  prices  and  economic  uncertainty,  we  will  strengthen  our  airline  financially 
and provide opportunities for our people to benefit from our planned growth and 
future success. 

With  respect  to  whether  there  will  be  union  representation  in  the  various  crafts 
or  classes  of  employees  after  the  merger  of  Delta  and  Northwest,  we  have  pledged 
to  respect  our  employees’  preferences  on  that  issue.  The  Railway  Labor  Act,  as  ad-
ministered  by  the  National  Mediation  Board,  provides  a  time-tested  process  for  de-
termining  employee  choices  regarding  representation  following  an  airline  merger. 
We of course will respect that process and those choices. In the meantime, we have 
provided  a  written  commitment  to  honor  the  existing  Northwest  collective  bar-
gaining agreements until any post-merger representation issues are resolved. 

Regarding seniority protection for the frontline employees of Delta and Northwest, 
Delta  took  the  initiative  last  year  when  our  Board  of  Directors  adopted  a  policy  to 
provide  a  process  for  fair  and  equitable  seniority  integration  for  employees  of  both 
companies  in  any  Delta  merger.  We  pledged  to  use  the  seniority  integration  provi-
sions  from  the  former  Civil  Aeronautics  Board’s  ruling  in  the  Allegheny-Mohawk 
merger. Delta and many other carriers have used the Allegheny-Mohawk provisions 
in prior mergers, and they are also provided for in many collective bargaining agree-
ments in the industry. Last December, Congress passed legislation that required the 
use  of  the  Allegheny-Mohawk  seniority  integration  provisions  in  airline  mergers. 
Delta  successfully  fought  to  assure  that  the  law  as  passed  protected  all  employees, 
whether  union  or  non-union.  We  carried  these  principles  through  our  negotiations 
with  Northwest  and  have  provisions  in  our  merger  agreement  that  provide  for  se-
niority protection. 
Small Communities Will Benefit from the Merger 

I  would  like  to  address  another  issue  that  I  know  is  very  important  to  this  Com-

mittee and our customers: service to small communities. 

Both  Delta  and  Northwest  are  very  proud  of  their  long  history  of  serving  small 
communities.  Northwest  has  often  been  the  only  way  for  people  in  small  towns  in 
the upper mid-west to connect with the rest of the country and the world. Similarly, 
Delta was founded in a small southern city and for years its focus was serving small 
southern  communities.  We  know  and  understand  the  importance  of  air  service  to 
the  economic  health  of  these  communities.  The  phenomenal  growth  of  Atlanta  and 
the  southeast  in  general  is  directly  related  to  the  superior  service  offered  from

Hartsfield Jackson Airport in Atlanta, largely by Delta. We intend to continue with 
these  traditions  and  to  remain  the  airline  providing  the  most  service  to  small  com-
munities  from  strategically  located  hubs  in  Atlanta,  Minneapolis,  Detroit,  New 
York,  Memphis,  Cincinnati  and  Salt  Lake  City.  This  is  not  just  customer  service, 
it  is  good  business—we  have  committed  publicly  that  we  will  not  close  any  hub  as 
a result of this merger. To keep these hubs profitable, we need the traffic from small 
communities around the country. A robust hub system is critical to the services de-
sired  by  small  communities.  It  is  the  most  effective  model  to  serve  these  commu-
nities since it allows us to use smaller aircraft to bring passengers from many small 
communities  to  the  hub  and  offer  broad  connecting  opportunities  for  these  pas-
sengers.  The  combined  Delta/Northwest  will  serve  over  140  small  communities, 
nearly  twice  the  number  served  by  our  next  closest  competitor.  The  merged  airline 
will  offer  new  service  to  nearly  3,000  domestic  origin  and  destination  markets  and 
over  6,000  new  international  markets,  greatly  expanding  the  ability  of  customers 
from  small  communities  to  reach  every  part  of  the  country  and  the  world  on  one 
airline. 

As  the  economies  of  the  world  become  linked  more  closely,  we  recognize  the  im-
portance  of  air  travel  to  the  ability  of  small  communities  to  compete  and  thrive  in 
a world economy. This merger will open up a new range of options for our customers 
in  small  communities  and  it  will  bring  them  in  closer  contact  with  the  rest  of  the 
world.  For  example,  the  combined  Delta/Northwest  will  provide  customers  in  48 
small communities served by Northwest better access to 83 additional international 
destinations  served  by  Delta  today,  while  passengers  in  51  small  communities 
served by Delta will gain greater access to 20 Northwest international destinations. 

The combined airline will offer passengers over 390 global destinations on a single 
airline up from 250 on Northwest alone and 327 on Delta alone. Customers in small 
towns in the south will be able to fly to Japan and much of Asia with one easy con-
nection on the same airline. That is not the case today. Similarly, customers in the 
upper  mid-west  will  have  many  more  options  to  fly  on  one  airline  network  to  more 
destinations  in  Europe  and  Latin  American  than  they  do  today.  Since  Delta  and 
Northwest  have  focused  their  attention  on  different  regions,  there  are  few  overlap 
routes  and  customers  will  gain  the  benefits  of  a  larger  combined  network  without 
any  material  reduction  in  services.  However,  providing  service  to  any  city,  whether 
small  or  large,  must  make  economic  sense  and  the  high  cost  of  fuel  for  Delta  and 
Northwest  is  far  more  likely  to  result  in  a  reduction  or  elimination  of  service  than 
this merger.

The Unprecedented Rise in the Price of Fuel Has Created Serious Risks for 

the Airline Industry 

No  discussion  about  the  current  state  of  the  airline  industry  would  be  complete 
without  mentioning  the  devastating  impact  of  the  unprecedented  rise  in  the  price 
of oil. Every day we read that the price of a barrel of oil has hit new records. Over 
the  last  5  years  we  have  experienced  a  28  percent  annualized  increase  in  oil  prices 
and in the last 12 months alone, the price of a barrel has nearly doubled. Most ana-
lysts  do  not  foresee  the  price  of  a  barrel  of  oil  going  below  $100  any  time  in  the 
near  future.  What  is  less  widely  publicized  is  the  equally  dramatic  rise  in  the  cost 
of jet fuel extracted from oil. Since 2001, the cost of a gallon of jet fuel has increased 
over 500 percent and nearly doubled since December 2006. 

The  airline  industry  is  somewhat  unique.  When  the  price  of  oil  rises  and  you  go 
to  fill  your  car  up  with  gasoline,  you  pay  more  at  the  pump;  there  is  little  choice. 
In  the  airline  industry,  we  are  lucky  if  we  can  recover  through  fare  increases  even 
50  percent  of  fuel  price  increases.  The  costs  have  to  be  made  up  somewhere  else. 
Despite becoming more and more fuel efficient and obtaining more and more produc-
tivity  from  our  employees  and  operations—Delta  and  Northwest  have  two  of  the 
lowest cost structures of the mainline carriers—the impact is dramatic. In 2003 fuel 
costs  consumed  17¢  of  every  dollar  of  passenger  revenue  we  received;  in  2008  that 
number  will  be  43¢.  Every  $1  increase  in  the  price  of  a  barrel  of  oil  costs  Delta 
about  $60  million.  The  increase  from  $110  to  $115  per  barrel  in  the  last  couple  of 
weeks alone will cost Delta over $300 million on an annual basis. As a result, there 
are fewer dollars left to improve passenger amenities, acquire new aircraft and pro-
vide better compensation and benefits to employees. The employees in this industry 
have  sacrificed  time  and  time  again.  The  dramatic  rise  in  fuel  costs  has  resulted 
in much of the cost savings our employees have generated through productivity and 
benefit  losses  being  used  to  pay  for  fuel  rather  than  to  improve  the  product.  In  ef-
fect, it has eroded most of the sacrifices they have made to make their company via-
ble and sustainable in the future. Merging Delta and Northwest will create a much 
more  financially  stable  company  with  approximately  $7  billion  in  liquidity  and  $1 
billion  in  annual  synergies.  The  combined  airline  will  be  able  to  withstand  an  80 
percent  greater  increase  in  fuel  price  than  either  airline  standing  alone,  and  still 
maintain profitability. This financial strength and flexibility, much greater than ei-
ther  airline  standing  alone,  will  provide  additional  resources  to  help  weather  this 
unprecedented fuel cost environment and a softening domestic market.

This Merger Will Be Beneficial to Customers 

I have already touched on some of the key benefits our customers can expect such 
as a significant expansion in the number of domestic and foreign locations that will 
be available from the merged airline. There will be other benefits such as a common 
frequent  flyer  program  that  will  provide  more  opportunities  to  earn  miles,  more 
schedule options, and more efficient routes for connecting passengers as we optimize 
the  combined  hub  structure.  Of  equal  importance,  the  financial  stability  and  flexi-
bility  of  the  combined  carrier  will  allow  us  to  re-invest  in  our  products  such  as 
planes,  in-flight  services  and  reservation  systems.  For  example,  we  have  publicly 
stated our intention to exercise options to purchase up to 20 new wide body jets be-
tween 2010 and 2013 to upgrade our fleet for international flying. 

We are mindful of the difficulties in combining the complex operations of two air-
lines and that other airline mergers have encountered problems that have inconven-
ienced customers. Delta and Northwest are committed to making this merger seam-
less  and  trouble  free  for  our  passengers.  Both  Delta  and  Northwest  are  members 
of  the  SkyTeam  alliance  and  have  gained  experience  in  working  cooperatively  on 
passenger service issues. Our frequent flyer programs, customer lounges and IT sys-
tems  are  already  partially  integrated.  In  addition,  we  will  be  able  to  build  on  the 
decades  long  partnership  between  Northwest  and  KLM  (now  a  part  of  Air  France) 
and  the  long  standing  relationship  between  Delta  and  Air  France.  All  of  these  fac-
tors will help smooth the integration process for our customers. 
The Merger Does Not Harm Competition 

Doug  Steenland’s  written  submission  will  deal  extensively  with  the  pro-competi-
tive  impact  of  this  proposed  merger  and  I  will  not  repeat  all  of  those  points.  I  will 
simply  say  that  these  two  airlines  have  complementary  networks;  Delta’s  domestic 
focus  is  in  the  east  and  mountain  west  while  Northwest  focuses  on  the  upper  mid- 
west. There are only twelve domestic nonstop overlapping markets. Even these non-
stop  overlaps  do  not  cause  competitive  problems,  as  Doug’s  statement  indicates. 
Similarly,  on  connecting  route  overlaps,  potential  competitive  effects  are  mitigated 
by the presence of low cost carriers, the relatively small market shares of Delta and 
Northwest, the availability of alternative airports and the likelihood that legacy car-
riers  will  expand  into  these  markets.  In  addition,  the  transaction  will  generate  sig-
nificant  efficiencies  through  such  factors  as  more  efficient  matching  of  aircraft  to 
routes  that  will  enable  the  combined  carrier  to  be  financially  stable  and  to  offer  a 
better  product  to  customers,  such  as  a  broad  global  network  and  enhanced  airport 
presence. 
Conclusion 

In  closing,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  support  we  have  received  from  Delta 
people throughout the company. It has been 3 weeks since we announced the merg-
er.  We  have  been  traveling  our  system  from  Atlanta  to  Cincinnati  to  New  York  to 
Salt Lake City and I am happy to say that Delta people are very excited about what 
this means to them. I believe that Doug will report the same about Northwest’s em-
ployees. 

Two weeks ago we had a meeting in Atlanta attended by almost 2000 employees. 
Some  of  our  people  have  traveled  here  today  to  show  their  support.  Our  people  ap-
preciate the fact that we are taking proactive steps to provide a more secure, finan-
cially  stronger  company  in  these  times  of  increased  foreign  competition,  record-set-
ting  fuel  prices  and  a  weakening  economy.  They  do  not  want  us  standing  still.  We 
look  forward  to  welcoming  Northwest  employees  to  join  with  their  Delta  counter-
parts to create and enjoy the benefits of being part of America’s premier global air-
line.

Mr.  NEIDL.  I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  for  inviting  me  to 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Could you pull that microphone a bit clos-

speak today. 

er, please? Thank you. 

Mr. NEIDL. OK. Is that better?

I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  for  inviting  me  here  today.  As  a 
long-time  student  of  the  industry,  I  have  great  interest  in  the  air-
lines,  their  cultures,  and  their  history.  But  as  a  Wall  Street  stock 
and  bond  analyst,  right  now  I  am  more  concerned  with  the  finan-
cial ability of the airlines. 

The industry is changing rapidly both in the U.S. and worldwide, 
and  the  industry  is  moving  more  and  more  toward  globalization. 
We can see trans-border mergers happening already overseas, par-
ticularly  in  Europe.  These  carriers  are  becoming  bigger  and  finan-
cially stronger and will give greater competition to the fragmented 
U.S. network carriers out there. 

Domestically,  the  network  carriers  continue  to  face  more  com-
petition from startup carriers. To go back a decade, startup carriers 
was  Southwest.  Today,  we  have  got  a  number  of  startup  carriers, 
a  few  less  than  we  had  a  few  weeks  ago,  but  we  still  have  a  num-
ber  of  startup  carriers  that  are  out  there  pricing  the  market  and 
domestically  probably  have  over  a  third  of  the  market  share  now, 
offering very tough competition for network carriers. 

Now,  looking  at  the  industry  since  9/11,  airline  management 
from  across  the  board  in  the  network  sector,  in  my  opinion,  have 
done  just  about  everything  they  can  to  cut  nonfuel  costs.  I  don’t 
think they can do much more. 

The  employees  have  given  everything  they  can.  They  can’t  go  to 
the  employees  any  longer.  They  have  revised  their  structures,  and 
basically,  they  are  trying  to  provide  complete  service  on  a  shoe-
string  type  of  budget.  So  there  is  not  a  lot  more  they  can  do,  and 
they  are  facing  these  tremendously  high  fuel  costs,  which  just  a 
year ago nobody believed it would be this high. 

Exit  barriers  for  those  carriers  are  strong,  though  we  are  seeing 
a  few  of  the  smaller,  less  capitalized  airlines  exit  right  now.  But 
the  bankruptcy  laws  allow  airlines  to  stay  around  almost  forever. 
It  took  years  for  a  very  weak  Pan  Am  and  Eastern  Airlines  to  fi-
nally shut the doors, and in the meantime, they were doing damage 
to the industry as they priced for cash flow. 

However,  entry  barriers  remain  pretty  open.  It  seems  like  there 
is  never  a  shortage  of  capital  for  people  wanting  to  start  airlines 
or people finding niches that they want to get in and grab a certain 
part  of  the  market  share  from  the  big  carriers.  It  is  slowing  down 
a  little  bit  now  with  high  fuel  prices  and  a  slowing  economy.  But 
that  will  change.  Recessions  come  and  go.  And  I  am  sure  a  whole 
host  of  new  startup  carriers  will  be  coming  into  the  market  over 
the next couple of years. 

Now, excess capacity, we have that in the system right now with 
high  fuel  prices.  They  have  led  to  weak  operating  margins  on  the 
part  of  the  airlines  and  has  weakened  them.  And  with  too  many 
seats being offered, the airlines are not pricing to meet their costs, 
particularly an uncontrollable cost like runaway fuel costs. 

The  industry—this  industry  is  going  to  have  to  restructure  one 
way or the other. It is either going to restructure through the guid-
ance  of  politicians  and  regulators  through  mergers,  orderly  merg-
ers,  or  the  bankruptcy  courts  will  take  care  of  it.  I  believe  that  a 
number  of  carriers,  the  next  time  they  go  into  bankruptcy,  if  they 
do, this will be for real. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

31 

Airlines  like  Delta  and  Northwest  have  done  everything  they 
could in bankruptcy to restructure themselves. If they are forced to 
go  in  again,  it  will  be  for  liquidation  this  time,  and  that  will  take 
care  of  excess  seats  in  the  market,  but  in  a  way  that  would  be 
tough on their employees and tough on the marketplace. 

Industry  consolidation,  if  properly  overseen  by  the  regulators,  I 
think,  would  be  a  benefit  to  the  employees,  to  the  investors  that 
supply capital to the industry, and to the traveling public. It would 
give them greater market mass. It will allow them to have greater 
ability  to  generate  revenues,  and  most  importantly,  it  will  give 
them  the  ability  to  cut  costs.  Maybe  a  little  bit  more  than  some 
people  would  like  to  see,  but  it  would  provide  the  opportunity  for 
elimination of duplicate services. 

Now, there is one major risk, in my opinion, with multiple merg-
ers  going  on  at  the  same  time.  If  you  look  at  the  history,  mergers 
have  always  proved  to  be  messy,  time  consuming,  and  in  many 
cases disruptive of services. If we have a number of mergers going 
on  at  the  same  time  among  major  U.S.  carriers,  it  could  create,  if 
it  is  not  done  properly,  panic  among  the  traveling  public  and  you, 
the  politicians,  would  hear  about  it  very  rapidly.  So  that  is  my 
main  concern  about  big  airline  mergers,  multiple  ones  happening 
at the same time. 

But bottom line and summary, the airlines are not meeting their 
cost of capital or their operating costs. Fuel, which is large and un-
controllable,  is  knocking  out  all  of  the  hard-won  cost  cutting  that 
has  been  done  by  the  airlines,  and  I  think  an  answer  to  that  is  to 
have sensible end-on-end type of mergers. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Neidl follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RAY NEIDL, ANALYST, CALYON SECURITIES INC. 

USA Airlines 

• The commercial aviation industry is becoming more global, whereby larger and 
financially stronger players will eventually dominate. This is already happening 
in the European Union (EU) which is treating the area as one market enabling 
its airlines to consolidate and become more efficient. The rapidly growing Asian 
economies  welcome  outside  investment  to  help  support  and  drive  growth  for 
their airlines. 
• U.S.  network  airlines  will  find  it  tougher  to  compete  in  a  more  global  and  effi-
ciently  run  industry  unless  they  are  allowed  to  gain  market  mass,  obtain  fur-
ther  cost  efficiencies  and  increase  their  ability  to  enhance  revenue  generation 
so  that  they  will  attract  capital  investment.  Although  foreign  carriers  are  not 
able  to  compete  in  the  U.S.  domestic  market,  network  carriers  are  facing  in-
creasingly  aggressive  competition  from  low-cost  carriers  in  this  sector,  thereby 
effectively squeezing network carriers from both sides. 
• Mergers  will  not  solve  all  of  the  industry  problems.  In  fact,  airline  mergers  in 
the  past  have  proved  to  be  relatively  expensive  and  inefficient  in  the  initial 
years. There is a major risk that there could be widespread disruptions in serv-
ice if more than one merger is being implemented at the same time. 
• However, properly planned and implemented, especially with the cooperation of 
the  employees,  mergers  could  produce  stronger  and  more  competitive  entities 
long-term.  Stronger  airlines  would  not  only  be  beneficial  but  are  a  necessity  to 
properly  serve  travelers  and  give  job  assurance  to  employees,  to  say  nothing  of 
attracting strategic investors. 

The  industry  has  done  a  commendable  job  in  rationalizing  capacity  and  reducing 
non-fuel costs since 9/11. Employees have contributed by easing work rules and ac-
cepting reduced compensation while airline managements have thoroughly reviewed 
their  systems  to  increase  efficiencies.  More  can  be  done  but  there  are  limitations.

As  oil  prices  exceed  $110  a  barrel,  something  has  to  be  done  to  further  rationalize 
the  overall  structure  of  the  industry.  Without  a  major  rationalization  of  capacity, 
slim profit margins will disappear, which will make it difficult for U.S. network car-
riers  to  modernize  their  fleets  to  stay  competitive  with  foreign  airlines  that  have 
been  rapidly  upgrading  their  fleets  with  new  technology-driven,  cost-efficient  air-
craft.  This  will  hurt  U.S.  network  carriers  in  the  long  run  and  ultimately  have  a 
negative  effect  on  aircraft  manufacturers  and  their  many  suppliers  across  the  U.S. 
and worldwide. 

As the industry moves toward globalization through trans-border mergers, foreign 
carriers  will  become  tougher  competitors  for  U.S.  based  network  airlines.  They  are 
gaining  market  mass  and  are  structuring  themselves  to  gain  in  financial  strength. 
Size  in  many  cases  also  can  mean  stronger  pricing  ability  since  a  broader  scope  of 
services can be offered in the international arena. 

Domestic  markets  are  currently  closed  to  these  growing  foreign  giants  but  the 
U.S.  network  carriers  are  facing  pressure  in  these  markets  from  start-up  low-cost 
airlines that have newer more efficient fleets, a lower wage cost structure and great-
er flexibility in adjusting their operations. They can cherry pick the best routes. 

Since  9/11,  the  U.S.  network  airlines  have  done  a  commendable  job  in  restruc-
turing  themselves  to  be  more  competitive  but  in  light  of  $110+  a  barrel  oil  prices, 
future progress will now be limited. The workers have given all they can and though 
further restructuring can be done, all the easy fruit has been picked. 

With  exit  barriers  high  as  a  result  of  U.S.  bankruptcy  law  and  entry  relatively 
easy  through  deregulation,  the  U.S.  airline  industry  has  reached  the  point  where 
we  have  too  many  airlines  offering  too  many  seat  miles  where  the  costs  cannot  be 
recovered through pricing as the multitude of airlines fight for market share to pre-
serve their systems and obtain a certain market mass and service footprint. Because 
of  strict  antitrust  laws,  airlines  cannot  coordinate  operations  or  pricing  even 
through their partnership agreements. 

Excess  capacity  and  competition  has  led  to  weak  operating  margins  and  profit-
ability  even  in  the  upper  part  of  the  economic  cycle.  With  fuel  costs  skyrocketing, 
the  industry  is  now  due  for  a  major  fall  again  as  we  enter  the  down  part  of  the 
cycle, whether it is this year or sometime further down the road. Weak profitability 
and balance sheets will lead to a crisis at some point. 

The  industry  will  have  to  restructure  one  way  or  the  other,  either  through  the 
relatively  organized  regulatory  oversight  of  mergers  or  in  the  more  risky  and  dis-
organized  guise  of  bankruptcy,  which  may  lead  to  certain  airlines  having  to  liq-
uidate. It probably would be better for all parties concerned, the consumer, employ-
ees and investors to go with the former rather than the latter. 

Industry  consolidation  that  leads  to  larger  carriers  will  not  solve  the  industry 
problems  by  itself  and  mergers  pose  their  own  set  of  challenges  and  problems,  par-
ticularly  in  the  labor  area.  However,  to  remain  competitive  in  an  industry  that  is 
becoming  more  international  and  globalized,  greater  market  mass  and  financial 
strength  will  be  needed  by  the  U.S.  network  airlines.  Part  of  the  market  mass  re-
quirement  is  being  met  currently  through  worldwide  alliances  but  that  is  not  the 
same as the same airline being able to control the passenger for the whole trip. 

Besides greater market mass, the two other benefits of consolidation would be cost 
cutting and revenue enhancement. To cut costs, marginal operations and smaller ex-
pensive  hub  operations  would  have  to  be  evaluated  as  to  their  viability  which  will 
have an affect on communities they currently serve. However, if service is justified, 
other airlines or niche carriers would move in if the hub was abandoned. If not eco-
nomical  to  serve  certain  small  communities  but  service  was  deemed  essential,  it 
would  be  up  to  public  entities  such  as  local,  state  or  national  government  to  sub-
sidize  the  service  and  not  the  airlines  and  their  investors.  These  situations  should 
be rare, however, since a host of lower cost airlines could probably profitably service 
these  areas.  The  other  benefit  would  be  revenue  enhancement.  The  first  thing  that 
comes  to  mind  is  higher  ticket  prices  if  there  are  fewer  competitors.  Higher  ticket 
prices  are  needed  and  justified.  With  over  $110  a  barrel  oil,  the  consumer  is  not 
paying their way and airlines cannot continue to subsidize them. However, revenue 
enhancement  would  also  include  the  additional  revenues  that  larger  carriers  could 
generate through a greater scope of services offered. 

A major risk with multiple consolidations going on at the same time is that there 
could  be  widespread  service  problems  initially  as  integration  takes  place.  It  has 
been  demonstrated  in  past  mergers  that  major  service  disruptions  are  possible,  if 
not  probable,  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  complex  integration  process.  If  there  were 
two  major  mergers  taking  place  at  the  same  time,  the  problem  would  be  com-
pounded over the Nation’s commercial aviation system. 

Bottom  line,  as  much  as  we  do  not  want  to  hear  this,  airlines  are  not  meeting 
their  cost  of  capital  or  in  fact  their  operating  costs  despite  the  major  efforts  by  the

33 

carriers to control costs and increase efficiencies. Fuel, largely noncontrollable in the 
short-term, is knocking out hard-won benefits and at some point fresh capital going 
into money-losing propositions will dry up. 
Conclusion 

There are major doubts if the industry can remain viable over the economic cycle 
with  oil  over  $110  a  barrel  if  there  are  not  major  structural  changes.  The  industry 
in  its  current  fragmented  form  cannot  sustain  profitability  under  these  cir-
cumstances.  Through  consolidation,  the  industry  will  be  in  a  better  position  to  ra-
tionalize  capacity,  further  cut  costs  and  enhance  revenues  since  they  will  better  be 
able to price their product at economical levels to earn a return on capital. Without 
profits  the  industry  will  ultimately  have  to  shrink.  A  more  efficient  industry  will 
be  beneficial  not  only  to  investors  and  attract  capital  but  will  give  employees  job 
security  and  ultimately  be  beneficial  to  customers  since  profitable  airlines  will  bet-
ter be able to serve the consumer.

STATEMENT  OF  PATRICIA  A.  FRIEND, 

INTERNATIONAL 
PRESIDENT,  ASSOCIATION  OF  FLIGHT  ATTENDANTS—CWA, 
AFL–CIO 
Ms.  FRIEND.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Rockefeller,  and 
thank  you  for  holding  this  very  important  hearing  on  our  aviation 
industry. 

We believe that Congress must take a hard and very serious look 
at where this industry is headed and that we must begin a serious 
dialogue on forming a rational aviation policy for this country. 

As you witness this merger and reports of other mergers and the 
fact that in April, four airlines ceased operations in a two-week pe-
riod,  you  must  agree  that  our  aviation  industry  is  failing  employ-
ees, consumers, and communities. This country has lacked a sound 
and rational aviation policy since deregulation. 

Prior  to  deregulation,  the  airline  industry  was  nurtured  and  de-
veloped  by  Federal  policy,  crafted  to  ensure  that  the  industry  was 
stable  and  able  to  promote  economic  development.  In  the  post  de-
regulation  environment,  the  industry  was  thrown  into  a  massive, 
market-driven 
restructuring—hundreds  of  bankruptcies  and 
defunct  airlines,  thousands  of  displaced  and  unemployed  airline 
workers, the worst consumer rankings and on-time performances in 
history,  an  outdated  air  traffic  control  system  that  cannot  handle 
the demand. 

We  have  seen  hundreds  of  communities  across  every  single  re-
gion of this country lose crucial air service, and we have heard the 
excuses  repeatedly  from  the  airline  executives.  They  have  blamed 
everything  from  the  national  economy  to  low-cost  startup  airlines 
and then to their favorite excuse, labor costs. It is interesting to me 
that  the  one  thing  that  remains  constant  in  this  industry  is  the

outrageous  sums  collected  in  pay  and  benefits  by  airline  manage-
ment, regardless of the economic performance of their carrier.

Now some may interpret my comments today as a call for re-reg-
ulation, but I am not convinced that is the answer. What I am say-
ing is we need a serious national dialogue so that we can agree on 
a  sound  and  rational  aviation  policy  that  works  for  everyone—em-
ployees, consumers, and communities. Everything should be on the 
table in this discussion, including the possibility of re-regulation or 
at least re-regulating part of the market. 

Our  future,  if  something  isn’t  done  to  develop  a  sound  aviation 
policy,  is  not  promising.  The  forces  of  globalization  are  now  poised 
to  bring  sweeping  changes  to  our  industry.  The  Open  Skies  agree-
ment between the United States and the European Union includes 
a provision for so-called second stage negotiations. 

If  those  second-stage  negotiations  result  in  a  repeal  of  current 
foreign  ownership  restrictions,  the  U.S.  aviation  industry  could  be 
outsourced.  This  is  a  future  that  will  lead  to  reduced  jobs  for  U.S. 
citizens  and  will  open  the  door  for  widespread  outsourcing  of  avia-
tion jobs, an idea already broached by Northwest management. 

The  solution  advanced  by  the  industry  today  is  for  greater  con-
solidation,  but  I  am  not  sure  that  we  should  rush  into  supporting 
this  call  for  greater  consolidation  without  taking  a  very  serious 
pause.  We  are  standing  at  the  edge  of  great  change  in  this  indus-
try,  and  it  is  important  that  we  begin  the  debate,  discussion,  and 
dialogue on what kind of national air system we want. 

I  am  very  glad  that  this  merger  between  Northwest  and  Delta 
has drawn significant attention. We should use it as an opportunity 
to  begin  that  national  discussion.  Very  troubling  to  us  in  this  spe-
cific  merger,  this  Northwest/Delta  merger,  is  the  serious  jeopardy 
in  which  it  places  the  collective  bargaining  rights  of  all  of  the 
Northwest  employees  who  have  fought  for  and  won  the  legal  right 
to have union representation. 

Virtually  all  of  the  employees  at  Northwest  have  chosen  to  join 
a  union.  Delta,  on  the  other  hand,  has  only  one  major  workgroup 
that  is  unionized,  its  pilots.  The  nearly  14,000  Delta  flight  attend-
ants  are  now  the  closest  to  securing  their  future  by  forming  a 
union  through  AFA–CWA.  They  are  currently  engaged  in  a  rep-
resentational election. 

These  flight  attendants  are  fighting  against  tremendous  odds 
and  against  a  company  that  is  determined  to  do  anything  and  ev-
erything possible to prevent their flight attendants from forming a 
union.  Just  since  the  NMB  mailed  its  voting  instructions  to  the 
Delta flight attendants on April 23, Delta management has flooded 
the flight attendant crew lounges with supervisors and wallpapered 
its  facilities  with  anti-AFA  posters,  urging  their  flight  attendants 
not to vote. 

No  merger  should  be  permitted  to  become  a  vehicle  for  union 
busting.  These  airline  executives  have  seized  the  opportunity  they 
see in this merger, not only a chance to prevent thousands of non- 
union  employees  from  gaining  a  union,  but  a  chance  to  eliminate 
the  unions  that  already  provide  protection  for  their  members  at 
Northwest. 

These  Delta  executives  have  not  been  shy  about  their  efforts  to 
prevent  the  employees  from  forming  unions.  In  fact,  in  a  recent 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

35 

meeting with AFA–CWA Northwest leadership, Northwest manage-
ment  stated  flatly  that  there  would  not  be  a  seat  at  the  table  for 
the flight attendants in these merger discussions. 

He  went  on  to  say  that  the  current  Delta  was  a  non-union  com-
pany  and  that  the  new  Delta  had  every  intention  of  remaining  a 
non-union company. Delta plans to defeat the union and to prevent 
the flight attendants from having or keeping the bargaining rights 
that are essential in the face of any merger. 

While much will be made over the coming months about the im-
pact  of  this  merger  on  consumers  and  communities,  I  urge  you  to 
remember  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  airline  employees  across 
this  country.  Keep  us  in  mind  as  you  review  this  merger  and  the 
impact  that  it  will  have  on  our  lives  and  our  families.  And  please, 
don’t  let  them  destroy  the  one  thing  that  we  have  protecting  us— 
our unions. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Ms. Friend follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRICIA A. FRIEND, INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT, 

ASSOCIATION OF FLIGHT ATTENDANTS—CWA, AFL–CIO 

Thank you, Chairman Rockefeller, for holding this vital and timely hearing on the 
state  of  the  airline  industry  and  the  proposed  merger  of  Northwest  and  Delta  Air-
lines. My name is Patricia Friend and I am the International President of the Asso-
ciation  of  Flight  Attendants—CWA,  AFL–CIO.  AFA–CWA  represents  over  55,000 
flight  attendants  at  20  U.S.  airlines  and  is  the  largest  union  in  the  world  rep-
resenting flight attendants. We especially want to thank the Committee for inviting 
us  to  testify  today  and  giving  voice  to  views  and  concerns  of  the  working  women 
and  men  that  have  kept  these  our  Nation’s  airlines  flying  during  the  good  times 
. . . and through some very difficult times. 

As a front line employee that has worked in the airline industry for over 40 years, 
I  have  had  a  unique  perspective  on  the  cyclical  yet  dramatic  changes  that  have  re-
shaped  the  industry  and  impacted  jobs.  As  the  President  of  a  union  representing 
employees  from  a  broad  cross  section  of  the  industry  from  legacy  carriers  like 
United,  U.S.  Airways  and  Northwest;  to  low  cost  carriers  like  AirTran  and  Spirit; 
and to regional carriers like American Eagle, Mesa and Mesaba, I am here to testify 
that  I  believe  we  are  at  a  major  turning  point  in  this  industry.  I  and  our  members 
have seen the seismic changes brought on by deregulation and have born the brunt 
of bankruptcies that saw major and historic airlines like Pan Am, Eastern and TWA 
disappear  forever.  We  braved  through  the  tragic  events  of  9/11,  reported  for  duty 
during  the  SARS  panic  and  navigated  through  bankruptcies  where  corporate  greed 
and  judicial  neglect  battered  our  profession  and  sought  to  destroy  good  paying  jobs 
with  benefits.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  assault  on  the  great  American  middle  class  was 
and is front and center in the airline industry. 

We  now  face  record  jet  fuel  prices  and  the  forces  of  globalization  that  threaten 
to remake this industry into something that I, nor none of my early flying partners, 
could have foreseen when I first put on my uniform in 1966. 

I  will  not  engage  this  Committee  with  a  trip  down  memory  lane  and  a  recitation 
of  exactly  how  much  this  industry  has  changed.  As  policymakers  that  have  wit-
nessed  most  of  this  change  first  hand  and  in  many  cases  have  played  a  role  in  the 
direction  of  this  industry,  you  are  as  familiar  with  those  changes  as  I  am.  But  I 
can  tell  you  that  we  are  at  point  where  it  is  absolutely  vital  that  Congress  must 
take  a  hard  and  serious  look  at  where  this  industry  is  headed  and  begin  a  serious 
dialogue  on  forming  a  rational  aviation  policy  for  this  country.  Each  and  every  one 
of  you  must  ask  yourselves  what  kind  of  aviation  system  do  you  envision  for  our 
country? As you witness this merger and reports of other mergers and the fact that 
four  airlines  ceased  operations  in  a  two-week  period  in  April,  you  must  agree  that 
our  aviation  industry  is  failing  employees,  consumers  and  communities.  You  have 
the  ability  and  responsibility  to  determine  the  course  for  the  airline  industry.  This 
industry, under this administration, has been handed over to management teams— 
some with little to no airline experience—who have destroyed middle class jobs and 
created the quagmire we are in today.

This  country  has  lacked  a  sound  and  rational  aviation  policy  since  deregulation. 
Prior  to  deregulation,  the  airline  industry  was  nurtured  and  developed  by  Federal 
policy  crafted  to  ensure  that  the  industry  was  stable  and  was  able  to  promote  eco-
nomic development in communities it served. In the post-deregulation environment, 
the industry was thrown into a massive market driven restructuring. So what have 
the  results  been?  Hundreds  of  bankruptcies  and  defunct  airlines,  thousands  of  dis-
placed  and  unemployed  airline  workers  and  their  families,  the  worst  consumer 
rankings and on-time performance in history and a out-dated air traffic control sys-
tem that cannot handle the demand. We have seen hundreds of communities across 
every  single  region  of  this  country  lose  vital  and  crucial  air  service  as  airlines  cut 
routes  and  scheduled  service  and  move  those  assets  to  serve  large  communities 
along  with  every  other  airline.  Despite  the  promises  of  deregulation,  the  industry 
still  struggles  to  make  a  profit  even  when  the  price  of  a  barrel  of  oil  was  half  its 
current  value.  We’ve  heard  the  excuses  repeatedly  from  airline  executives.  They’ve 
blamed  everything  from  the  national  economy,  to  low  cost,  startup  airlines  and  to 
their favorite excuse—labor costs. It’s interesting to me, that the one thing that has 
remained constant in the industry is the outrageous sums collected in pay and bene-
fits  by  airline  management  regardless  of  the  economic  performance  of  their  carrier. 
Corporate  greed  is  the  one  thing  that  has  remained  constant  during  my  career.  If 
anything  in  that  category  has  changed,  it’s  that  the  amounts  they  reward  them-
selves every year grows more and more excessive while employees earn less. 

What  we  have  today  is  an  industry  and  aviation  system  that  literally  seems  to 
be at the brink of collapse. Besides the urgently needed upgrades to the technology 
of  our  air  traffic  control  system  and  the  investment  in  the  workforce  to  run  that 
technology,  we  are  seeing  a  business  model  that  seems  to  leave  out  of  its  equation 
the  impact  for  employees,  communities  and  consumers.  The  only  thing  that  seems 
to  be  driving  this  industry  today  is  how  big  the  bottom  line  return  is  for  a  select 
few. It doesn’t matter that our aviation system is a vital part of our national infra-
structure  and  one  that  has  made  this  country  the  powerful  economic,  cultural  and 
military  power  that  it  is  today.  It  is  now  a  commodity  that  simply  must  be  maxi-
mized to generate a profit for a select few. 

Since  deregulation,  our  aviation  policy  has  been  dictated  and  driven  entirely  by 
the  marketplace.  Is  this  a  wise  policy  for  an  aviation  system  that  is  as  important 
and vital to our country? I could not find any better words to describe my own feel-
ings about this policy than those used by Senator Dorgan at a hearing of this Com-
mittee last year. Senator Dorgan, when discussing the state of the aviation system, 
stated that he believed in the marketplace and that it often resulted in good things. 
But that the marketplace needed an umpire to make sure that it worked for every-
one.  I  could  not  agree  more.  Deregulation  has  resulted  in  some  positive  develop-
ments. The marketplace has indeed increased competition and reduced fares for con-
sumers  in  some  markets.  But  the  unfettered  marketplace  has  also  led  to  the  loss 
of air service to struggling communities, the increasing difficulty for airline employ-
ees to make a decent living, calls for a passenger bill of rights and, most troubling, 
life saving safety initiatives that are the first casualty of the cost cutting knife. 

Some  may  interpret  my  comments  as  a  call  for  deregulation.  I’m  not  convinced 
that  is  the  answer.  What  I  am  saying  is  that  we  need  a  serious  national  dialogue 
to  start  now,  so  that  we  can  determine  a  sound  and  rational  aviation  policy  that 
works  for  everyone  in  this  country—employees,  consumers  and  communities.  And 
we  cannot  afford  to  wait.  Everything  should  be  on  the  table  in  this  discussion,  in-
cluding the possibility of re-regulation—or at least re-regulating part of the market. 
Today,  I  and  my  members—indeed  all  aviation  employees—look  around  at  an  in-
dustry  where  the  days  of  an  airline  job  leading  to  a  secure,  stable  and  exciting  ca-
reer is slipping away. The market forces have squeezed us to the point where some 
regional  airlines  are  offering  to  start  paying  their  employees  $13,000  a  year  with 
virtually  no  benefits  to  speak  of.  Pensions  are  gone  or  frozen.  Job  prospects  in  the 
industry are bleak and everyone is in fear that their job is the next to be eliminated. 
Airline management keeps telling us that they cannot afford to go on with the cur-
rent price of fuel and that something must be done. 

We’ve had an interesting past of growth, change and turmoil. We are in a present 
that  is  uncertain  and  bleak.  Our  future,  if  something  isn’t  done  to  develop  a  sound 
aviation  policy,  is  even  less  promising.  The  forces  of  globalization  are  now  poised 
to bring sweeping changes to the airline industry yet again. The Open Skies Agree-
ment  between  the  United  States  and  European  Union,  which  went  into  effect  this 
spring,  includes  a  provision  for  so-called  second  stage  negotiations  that  seeks  to 
eliminate long-standing U.S. aviation law that ensures U.S. carriers are owned and 
controlled by U.S. citizens. If those negotiations result in a repeal of these laws, the 
U.S.  aviation  industry  could  be  outsourced.  The  opening  of  markets  across  the  At-
lantic  will  create  greater  competition  for  our  already  struggling  domestic  aviation

industry, which has recently relied on international flights to generate profits. While 
many  of  the  U.S.  airlines  did  nothing  to  oppose  the  agreement  last  year,  they  are 
now citing the Open Skies Agreement and the increased competition it is unleashing 
as yet another factor in the need for consolidation and their worsening bottom line. 
As this competition increases over the coming years, no doubt greater pressure will 
be  placed  on  the  U.S.  Government  to  lift  the  cap  on  foreign  ownership  and  control 
restrictions on U.S. airlines. This pressure will undoubtedly come from foreign gov-
ernments  eager  to  help  their  own  flag  carriers  gain  control  of  the  domestic  U.S. 
market.  This  is  a  future  that  will  only  lead  to  reduced  jobs  for  U.S.  citizens  on 
flights overseas and opens the door for the widespread outsourcing of aviation jobs— 
an idea already broached by Northwest management. 

The  solution  advanced  by  the  industry  today,  and  which  seems  to  daily  become 
almost accepted fact by many, is for greater consolidation. They tell us that in order 
to  survive  a  world  of  dramatically  high  fuel  prices  and  increased  foreign  competi-
tion,  mergers  and  consolidation  are  necessary.  I’m  not  so  sure  that  we  should  rush 
headlong  into  supporting  this  call  for  greater  consolidation  without  taking  a  very 
serious  pause.  With  us  standing  at  the  edge  of  great  change  in  this  industry,  it  is 
important  that  we  begin  the  debate,  discussion  and  dialogue  on  what  kind  of  na-
tional aviation policy we want. 

That  is  why  I  am  so  glad  that  this  merger  between  Northwest  and  Delta  has 
drawn  significant  attention  from  the  media,  communities  served  by  both  carriers 
and  here  on  Capitol  Hill.  The  attention  being  paid  to  what  will  create  the  largest 
airline in the world is appropriate . . . and necessary. We must use it as an oppor-
tunity to begin that national discussion on our aviation policy. 

In  light  of  this  proposed  merger,  I  believe  that  it  is  important  to  note  that  while 
some  protections  are  in  place  for  consumers  and  communities,  there  are  virtually 
no  protections  for  airline  workers  in  this  merger.  There  has  been  little  attention 
paid  to  the  extreme  upheaval  that  mergers  create  for  the  thousands  of  airline  em-
ployees who find themselves unemployed or whose lives are disrupted. 

This  has  not  always  been  the  plight  of  airline  workers.  There  were  many  impor-
tant  protections  in  place  for  airline  workers  prior  to  the  Airline  Deregulation  Act 
of 1978; the Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective Provisions (commonly know as the 
LPPs)  were  made  a  condition  of  government  approval  of  virtually  every  airline 
merger.  The  LPPs  contained  extensive  and  specific  protections—like  displacement 
and  relocation  allowances,  wage  protections,  transfer  and  seniority  protections,  lay-
off  protection,  and  others—as  part  of  a  standardized  set  of  provisions  designed  to 
shield workers from an unfair share of the burden resulting from corporate mergers. 
But  no  real  protections  from  our  Federal  Government  exist  today  to  cushion  air-
line workers involved in mergers. After Deregulation employers successfully lobbied 
for an end to the LPPs because, as they argued at the time, these matters are ‘bet-
ter  left  to  the  collective  bargaining  process.’  Union  contracts  provide  a  level  of  pro-
tection  for  those  employees  covered  by  the  agreement,  but  there  is  little  to  no  pro-
tection for non-union airline employees. 

Those  same  employers  who  wanted  to  leave  these  protections  to  the  bargaining 
process  now  spend  millions  of  dollars  on  union  busting,  trying  to  prevent  their  em-
ployees  from  attaining  the  right  to  bargain,  or  to  strip  that  right  from  those  who 
have  had  it  for  decades.  And  today,  many  of  those  same  employers  who  hold  press 
conferences  to  trumpet  the  fact  that  their  mergers  will  not  cause  any  layoffs  often 
refuse to agree in writing to such guarantees. 

Mr. Chairman, there is a distinct and vast difference between a commitment and 
a  contract.  Union  employees  have  commitments  in  writing,  non-union  employees 
rely on a commitment that can change instantly. 

Of all the well-developed rules referred to prior to Deregulation as the Allegheny- 
Mohawk  Labor  Protective  Provisions,  only  one  exits  today—the  provision  estab-
lishing basic seniority protections in the event of a merger. And, that provision was 
only  recently  resurrected  and  included  in  last  December’s  Omnibus  Appropriations 
bill  after  the  advocacy  of  AFA–CWA  and  the  strong  leadership  of  Senator  Claire 
McCaskill and this Congress. 

Earlier  attempts  by  Congress  to  provide  protections  for  airline  employees  during 
mergers provides us with an instructive history in the current context. We continue 
to  feel  the  effects  of  the  Airline  Deregulation  Act.  The  proposed  Delta—Northwest 
merger  is  just  the  latest  manifestation  of  the  impact  of  Deregulation.  But  an  at-
tempt by Congress to cushion the clearly anticipated effects of the start of Deregula-
tion proved to be a complete failure. 

Congress included the Airline Employee Protection Program (EPP) in the Deregu-
lation  Act  to  assist  adversely  affected  employees.  At  least  40,000  employees  lost 
their  jobs  in  the  wake  of  Deregulation.  The  EPP  was  supposed  to  provide  for  both 
monthly compensation and first-hire rights at other airlines. However, displaced em-

ployees  never  received  the  benefits  Congress  promised  and  funding  was  never  au-
thorized for the benefits, turning the whole program into a cruel joke for airline em-
ployees  in  desperate  need  of  a  life  line.  So  while  Congress  has  recognized  the  need 
to  assist  airline  employees  facing  the  traumatic  effects  of  industry  consolidation  in 
the past, a fully-funded Federal effort is desperately needed now in what is shaping 
up to be another significant era of airline consolidation. 

Executives  at  the  airlines  have,  to  date,  promised  that  there  will  be  no  layoffs, 
but  they  refuse  to  put  that  commitment  in  writing.  We  all  know  that  the  minute 
the  ink  is  dry  on  the  merger  agreement,  executives  will  be  looking  for  cost  saving 
‘synergies’  that  will  make  the  new  airline  ever  more  profitable.  Many  of  the 
synergies that the executives will likely turn to first are precisely the steps that will 
harm the interests of the workers, such as furloughs, base closures, fleet reductions 
and, perhaps worst of all, outsourcing. 

Workers  cannot,  and  should  not,  be  left  to  fend  for  themselves  in  this  situation; 
we  did  not  bring  these  problems  on  ourselves.  The  Federal  Government  set  this 
chain  of  events  in  motion  with  the  passage  of  the  Deregulation  Act  and  its  subse-
quent  neglect  in  forming  a  rational  aviation  policy  for  our  country.  The  airlines 
themselves  have  compounded  the  problems  for  workers  with  an  almost  endless 
string of cutbacks, bankruptcies, mergers and layoffs. Government and the airlines, 
then,  bear  the  responsibility.  And,  either  the  Federal  Government  or  the  airlines 
must pay to offset what is otherwise the unfair burden placed on the workers result-
ing from Deregulation and its current aftermath. 

As  we  look  for  solutions  to  cushion  the  enormous  negative  impact  this  latest 
merger  will  have  on  workers  at  Northwest  and  Delta,  perhaps  it’s  time  to  revisit 
the  concept  of  employee  protection  from  the  Deregulation  Act.  No,  we  are  not  pro-
posing  to  re-regulate  the  industry  today;  that’s  a  worthy  discussion  for  a  different 
hearing  that  we  welcome  and  we  would  encourage  Congress  to  hold.  But  we  do 
think that—at a minimum—something needs to be done to shield workers from the 
harshest effects of this merger and any future mergers. 

The Deregulation Act provided monthly compensation and first-hire rights to pro-
tect  displaced  airline  workers.  Those  same  protections  are  needed  and  appropriate 
today  on  the  eve  of  the  Delta—Northwest  merger  and  potential  mergers  to  come. 
Congress  could  adopt  and  fund  those  protections,  or  it  could  require  the  employer, 
as  a  condition  of  approval  of  this  merger,  to  fund  those  protections.  We  must  stop 
shifting these costs on employees who are least able to shoulder that burden. 

Most  troubling  to  us,  this  merger  also  seriously  jeopardizes  the  collective  bar-
gaining rights of all the Northwest employees who have fought for and won the legal 
right  to  have  union  representation.  Virtually  all  employees  at  Northwest  have  cho-
sen  to  join  a  union.  Delta,  on  the  other  hand,  has  only  one  major  workgroup  that 
is  unionized—its  pilots.  I  am  proud  to  say  today  that  the  approximately  13,500 
Delta  flight  attendants  are  now  the  closest  to  securing  their  future  by  forming  a 
union  through  AFA–CWA  as  they  are  currently  engaged  in  a  representation  elec-
tion. 

Delta  flight  attendants  have  been  working  diligently  to  secure  a  better  future 
through joining AFA–CWA and eventually securing a legally binding contract. Their 
hard work paid off when they filed cards from over 50 percent of all the Delta flight 
attendants  requesting  an  election  to  join  AFA–CWA.  Late  last  month  the  National 
Mediation  Board  (NMB)  mailed  voting  instructions  to  Delta  flight  attendants  and 
the  voting  will  end  on  May  28th.  We  remain  confident  that  this  dedicated  group  of 
Delta  flight  attendants  will  come  together  and  choose  union  representation  and  a 
strong  voice  to  protect  themselves  and  the  future  of  their  profession,  but  the  anti- 
union  tactics  of  management  have  put  that  outcome  in  jeopardy  while  at  the  same 
time  threatening  the  future  collective  bargaining  rights  of  the  Northwest  flight  at-
tendants. 

These flight attendants are fighting against tremendous odds and a company that 
is  determined  to  do  anything  and  everything  possible  to  prevent  flight  attendants 
from  joining  a  union.  I  am  testifying  for  AFA–CWA  today  to  express  our  outrage 
over  Delta  Air  Lines’  ubiquitous  and  coercive  campaign  to  interfere  with  its  flight 
attendants’  right  to  freely  select  a  bargaining  representative  under  the  Railway 
Labor Act. Since the NMB mailed its voting instructions to the Delta flight attend-
ants  on  April  23,  Delta  management  has  flooded  the  flight  attendant  crew  lounges 
with  supervisors,  and  wallpapered  its  facilities  with  anti-AFA  posters  urging  flight 
attendants  to  not  vote.  Or  as  Delta  puts  it:  ‘‘Give  a  Rip—Don’t  Click,  Don’t  Dial.’’ 
At  the  same  time  Delta’s  CEO  was  testifying  before  the  House  subcommittee  in 
April,  a  letter  over  his  signature,  along  with  an  anti-union  video,  was  already  in 
the  mail  to  flight  attendants’  homes.  The  first  of  what  AFA–CWA  expects  will  be 
many  Delta-produced  anti-union  DVDs,  was  mailed  out  probably  no  later  than  the 
day after the NMB election commenced. The DVD, titled ‘‘Important Information for

Delta Flight Attendants,’’ was included in a slick package featuring a personal mes-
sage  from  Mr.  Anderson  outlining  the  reasons  why  a  vote  for  AFA  would  have  the 
effect  of  ‘‘negatively  changing  a  great  relationship.’’  Anderson  goes  on  to  reminisce 
about his days at unionized carrier Northwest by stating several blatant falsehoods: 
‘‘When I unilaterally gave pay raises and domestic partner benefits to flight at-
tendants at Northwest, I received loud objections from the union because those 
benefits were paid directly because it was the right thing to do. The union often 
would criticize and vilify management in order to promote their own value.’’ 

Perhaps  Mr.  Anderson’s  memory  is  clouded,  or  he  knowingly  made  these  untrue 
statements.  In  any  event  they  are  false.  Danny  Campbell  the  former  President  of 
the  Northwest  flight  attendants  when  they  were  represented  by  the  International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters, has submitted a sworn affidavit to the NMB stating that 
Mr. Anderson was not the CEO at Northwest when he ‘‘gave pay raises and domes-
tic partner benefits to flight attendants’’ and further, Anderson never granted a pay 
raise  to  the  Northwest  flight  attendants  during  his  tenure  as  CEO.  In  fact,  Ander-
son  demanded  pay  cuts  and  benefit  concessions  beginning  in  2002  and  continuing 
with the successor Union to the Teamsters, the Professional Flight Attendants Asso-
ciation, through 2006. 

The major push in Delta’s anti-union offensive is taking place at the flight attend-
ant airport crew lounges located at Delta facilities across the system. Because crew 
lounges are the one, if not the only, central location for flight attendants to interact 
while  at  work,  AFA–CWA  has  set  up  information  tables  manned  by  AFA–CWA  ac-
tivists  as  means  to  communicate  the  union’s  message  and  to  encourage  flight  at-
tendants to vote. Delta has responded by flooding the crew lounges with Inflight su-
pervisors,  some  of  whom  are  wearing  T-shirts  with  the  message  ‘‘How  was  your 
flight’’  on  the  back.  Those  supervisors  are  actively  interfering  with  the  ability  of 
AFA–CWA supporters to speak to their co-workers. 

On  April  26,  at  Delta’s  Atlanta  crew  lounge,  a  supervisor  started  shouting  that 
AFA–CWA  was  ‘‘scum’’  as  union  activists  were  speaking  to  a  flight  attendant  at 
their  table.  Later  that  same  day,  the  International  Base  Manager  told  AFA–CWA 
activists to take down a small sign that said ‘‘STEP UP’’ even though the issue signs 
had  been  resolved  by  other  Delta  management  personnel.  Delta  has  also  set  up  in-
formation tables and huge banners in the crew lounge with large posters imploring 
flight  attendants  to  ‘‘Give  a  Rip—Don’t  Click,  Don’t  Dial.’’  In  other  words—don’t 
vote. Delta’s information tables contain multiple signs and leaflets next to a contin-
uous running video of CEO Richard Anderson imploring the flight attendants to re-
ject unionization. 

The increased presence of Inflight supervisors in the crew lounge coupled with the 
overwhelming  amount  of  literature  and  posters  urging  flight  attendants  to  reject 
AFA–CWA has created a hostile, coercive environment that has destroyed the ‘‘lab-
oratory conditions’’ the NMB is supposed to protect during a representation election. 
There  is  no  basis  for  Delta  to  excuse  this  interference  as  simply  ‘‘informational,’’ 
much  less  that  it  represents  Delta’s  ‘‘neutrality’’  during  the  election.  The  company 
clearly  is  pulling  out  all  the  stops  to  destroy  any  chance  that  its  flight  attendants 
will be able to select a representative freely and without interference. 

On  May  2,  Delta  executives  attempted  a  coup  de  grace,  announcing  a  pay  raise 
for  all  ‘‘non-contract’’  employees  scheduled  to  take  effect  on  July  1,  after  the  flight 
attendants  election  is  scheduled  to  be  completed.  The  wording  of  Delta’s  announce-
ment  makes  it  clear  to  all  flight  attendants  that  the  raise  will  not  be  provided  if 
they  vote  for  the  union.  For  obvious  reasons,  this  is  a  textbook  example  of  inter-
ference.  AFA–CWA  wants  to  make  it  clear:  we  support  the  pay  raise  for  flight  at-
tendants.  Like  their  colleagues  at  other  airlines,  the  Delta  flight  attendants  have 
suffered  drastic  cuts  in  pay  and  benefits  as  a  result  of  the  airline’s  recent  bank-
ruptcy.  But,  this  Committee  should  ask  Mr.  Anderson  to  state,  on  the  record  and 
under  oath,  if  the  raise  will  be  given  to  flight  attendants  whether  or  not  they  vote 
for  the  union.  If  he  refuses,  and  insists  on  maintaining  the  right  to  deny  the  raise 
to  flight  attendants  if  they  vote  for  the  union,  then  the  coercive  effect  of  the  raise 
will  be  clear.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  he  agrees  to  grant  the  raise  regardless  of  the 
election  outcome,  AFA–CWA  will  waive  its  right  to  object  to  the  raise  as  inter-
ference. 

The  incidents  of  Delta  interference  I  have  discussed  are,  in  AFA–CWA’s  view, 
only a sample of the coercive acts Delta executives will unleash on its flight attend-
ants in the weeks preceding the May 28, ballot count. Indeed, Delta’s conduct in the 
past week reflects its utter contempt and indifference to the election rules the NMB 
is  responsible  for  enforcing.  AFA–CWA  has  urged  the  NMB  to  fulfill  its  statutory 
obligation  to  supervise  this  election  in  a  manner  that  prevents  Delta  from  blithely 
poisoning  the  laboratory  conditions  necessary  for  a  lawful  election.  To  that  end,

AFA–CWA  has  argued  that  ‘‘extraordinary  circumstances’’  exist  in  this  election 
process and demand an immediate Board investigation under Rule 17.0 of the NMB 
Representation Manual. We have requested that, while the investigation is ongoing, 
the Board should order Delta to: 

• immediately  cease  its  interference  and  coercion  with  respect  to  AFA–CWA’s 
communication activities in the flight attendant crew lounges; 
• cease its deliberate misstatements regarding voter eligibility; 
• cease its intrusive and false communication to flight attendants, and 
• send a notice to all flight attendants on the eligibility list to report all incidents 

of interference and coercion to the NMB. 

Failure  to  stem  Delta’s  unlawful  activities  will  irrevocably  taint  the  laboratory 
conditions needed for a legitimate election. This Board’s track record on interference 
leaves AFA–CWA with grave doubts that any action will be taken by the NMB. 

In  the  context  of  this  merger,  the  company’s  anti-union  tactics  take  on  added  ur-
gency;  the  merger  should  not  be  permitted  to  become  a  vehicle  for  union  busting. 
Airline executives have realized the opportunity that this merger presents: not just 
a  chance  to  prevent  thousands  of  non-union  employees  from  gaining  a  union,  but 
also a chance to eliminate the unions that already provide protection for their mem-
bers at Northwest. 

While  Delta  flight  attendants  vote  on  whether  to  join  the  union,  the  Northwest 
flight attendants face a very real threat to their collective bargaining rights. North-
west flight attendants have been union members for 60 years. Their proud tradition 
of  union  representation  is  threatened  by  management’s  use  of  this  merger  process 
to attempt to eliminate the Northwest flight attendants collective bargaining agree-
ment  which,  in  turn,  poses  a  real  threat  to  the  job  security  for  thousands  of  flight 
attendants. 

In fact, we view the current representation election among the Delta flight attend-
ants  as  not  just  an  opportunity  for  them  to  gain  a  voice  on  the  job  and  a  seat  at 
the  table,  but  as  the  ‘‘first  line  of  defense’’  to  protect  the  over  60  years  of  collective 
bargaining rights for the Northwest flight attendants. This is due to the unique way 
that  representation  elections  are  governed  by  the  National  Mediation  Board.  Al-
though  the  Railway  Labor  Act  (RLA)  makes  no  mention  of  such  an  extraordinary 
requirement,  the  NMB  rules  state  that  in  order  for  a  representation  election  to  be 
considered  valid,  a  majority  of  all  eligible  voters  must  turn  out  to  vote  in  the  elec-
tion.  If  95  percent  of  flight  attendants  who  cast  a  vote  want  to  join  AFA–CWA  but 
only  49.9  percent  of  all  the  eligible  flight  attendants  cast  a  vote,  then  the  election 
is invalid. 

In  effect,  a  person  who  chooses  not  to  cast  a  vote  in  an  NMB  election  is  counted 
as  a  ‘‘no’’  vote,  encouraging  management  to  focus  their  efforts  on  voter  suppression 
in  every  election.  I  ask  the  members  of  the  Committee  to  consider  if  they,  or  most 
of  their  colleagues,  would  be  sitting  here  today  if  our  Congressional  elections  were 
governed  under  the  same  onerous  rules,  where  turnout  is  more  important  than  the 
votes cast. 

Based  on  the  number  of  Delta  flight  attendants  who  have  signed  AFA  authoriza-
tion  cards,  and  the  number  of  Northwest  flight  attendants  who  are  already  union 
members, AFA has the support of a solid majority of the combined work force. Since 
at least 1926, national labor policy as defined by this Congress has been to encour-
age  unionization  of  workers.  Congress  could  further  that  goal,  and  prevent  airline 
mergers  from  becoming  an  occasion  for  union  busting,  simply  by  defining  victory 
under the RLA organizing rules as a majority of the votes cast. 

It is our hope, and the hope of thousands of Delta flight attendants, that they will 
overcome  these  difficult  election  procedures  and  decide  next  month  to  join  AFA– 
CWA.  They  will  then  have  the  right  to  bargain  for  improved  work  rules  through  a 
legally  binding  contract  and  the  historic  collective  bargaining  rights  of  the  North-
west flight attendants will have been protected in the newly merged Delta Airlines. 
Delta and Northwest flight attendants, working under the umbrella of AFA–CWA’s 
constitution and bylaws, can move forward on integrating their two groups and ne-
gotiating  for  an  improved  contract  for  what  will  be  the  largest  flight  attendant 
workgroup  in  the  United  States.  This  does  not  require  new  legislation;  all  we  ask 
is that the Committee urge these employers to remain neutral so, as originally envi-
sioned  by  Congress  when  it  adopted  the  Railway  Labor  Act,  the  employees  can  de-
cide the issue of union representation for themselves, without coercion, interference 
or influence by the employer. 

Bargaining  rights  are  paramount  if  the  flight  attendants  are  to  have  an  oppor-
tunity  to  negotiate  over  the  impact  this  merger  will  have  on  their  work  lives.  Our 
primary concern is that Delta executives will use the merger to eliminate the rights

of  employees  to  have  a  seat  at  the  table  when  the  airline  is  fully  merged  with 
Northwest. 

Delta  executives  have  not  been  shy  about  their  efforts  to  prevent  the  employees 
from  forming  unions.  In  fact,  in  a  meeting  with  AFA–CWA  Northwest  leadership, 
Northwest management stated flatly that there would not be a seat at the table for 
the flight attendants in the merger discussions. He went on to state that the current 
Delta  was  a  non-union  company  and  that  the  ‘‘New  Delta’’  had  every  intention  of 
remaining a non-union company; Delta planned to defeat the union and prevent the 
flight  attendants  from  having,  or  keeping,  the  bargaining  rights  that  are  essential 
in the face of this merger. Delta has already demonstrated that they will again con-
tinue to spread disinformation and make every effort to prevent Delta flight attend-
ants  from  casting  ballots  in  the  upcoming  election.  Is  this  what  we’ve  come  to  in 
this country? I would ask this Committee: what is wrong with our system when the 
majority  of  these  flight  attendants  want  union  representation  and  yet  face  such 
great barriers to achieve that goal? 

Using this merger as an opportunity to destroy unions provides these airlines, and 
all who would follow, with an opportunity to drive down wages, work rules and ben-
efits  for  all  airline  employees.  It  can  create  a  domino  effect  that  will  force  even 
unionized carriers to match those drastic cuts in order to compete. They will set in-
dustry standards back to levels we have not seen in decades. If Delta is a non-union 
carrier, as well as the largest carrier, they will be poised to set in motion an unprec-
edented  remaking  of  the  entire  airline  industry  that  will  destroy  airline  jobs  as  a 
stable and secure middle class career once and for all. 

Flight  attendants  face  one  other  devastating  threat  in  this  merger,  one  that  no 
other work group is likely to encounter. This merger may resurrect efforts by North-
west  executives  to  outsource  our  best  jobs  to  flight  attendants  based  outside  the 
U.S. Such outsourcing of flight attendant jobs on international routes to foreign na-
tionals  will  resurface  and  become  a  standard  industry  practice.  When  Northwest 
first  proposed  doing  just  this  during  bankruptcy,  a  bipartisan  group  of  House  and 
Senate  members  rose  up  to  decry  such  a  move  as  jeopardizing  aviation  safety  and 
especially security. With a union fighting to protect the Northwest flight attendants 
jobs,  and  support  from  Members  of  Congress,  Northwest  management  backed  off 
such  a  proposal  and  thousands  of  good  paying  jobs  remained  for  Northwest  flight 
attendants. Only if the union retains its bargaining rights following the merger will 
the flight attendants have the legal standing to continue the fight against such out-
rageous  ideas  as  outsourcing  flight  attendant  jobs;  such  an  idea  is  just  the  tip  of 
the  iceberg.  Many  of  the  current  Delta  executives  were  involved  in  earlier 
outsourcing attempts when they were at Northwest Airlines. 

I urge the members of this Committee to send a strong and clear signal to North-
west,  and  especially  to  Delta  executives,  that  they  must  not  use  this  merger  as  a 
means to destroy the collective bargaining rights of the employees. I would urge this 
Committee  to  use  its  good  offices  to  monitor  Delta  management  as  this  representa-
tion election progresses over the next 5 weeks so that they do not engage in election 
activities similar to those of 5 years ago—actions that violated the spirit of the Rail-
way  Labor  Act,  even  if  the  NMB  ruled  they  did  not  violate  the  letter  of  the  law. 
And finally, I hope that you will use your influence to persuade Delta management 
to remain neutral in this representation election. If they are successful in their goal 
to  keep  the  ‘‘new  Delta’’  non-union,  we  could  see  this  merger  as  the  beginning  of 
the end for the airline industry as a source of decent and respectable jobs. 

While much will be made over the coming months about the impact of this merger 
on consumers and communities, I urge you to remember the hundreds of thousands 
of airline employees across this country. Keep us in mind as you review this merger 
and the impact that it will have on our lives and our families. We are the ones who 
have the most to lose; and we have the least protection. Most importantly, don’t let 
them destroy the one thing we have protecting us—our unions. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much, Ms. Friend. 
And  our  next  witness  is  Mr.  Robert  Roach,  who  is  the  General 
Vice  President—Transportation,  The  International  Association  of

STATEMENT OF ROBERT ROACH, JR., GENERAL VICE 

PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS 

AND AEROSPACE WORKERS 

Mr.  ROACH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  the  Members  of  the 
Committee,  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  today  concerning 
the transportation industry in our country. 

Let  me  say  from  the  outset  I  believe  I  am  the  only  one  at  this 
table who has been part of a merger, along with tens of thousands 
of  people  from  TWA.  We  lost  our  jobs.  We  lost  our  pensions.  We 
lost  our  health  insurance.  In  addition,  the  once  thriving  hub  of  St. 
Louis,  which  was  promised  would  always  be  a  thriving  hub,  and 
other  locations  within  that  structure  would  be  there.  We  were 
promised  jobs,  just  as  jobs  would  be  a  promise  today.  And  all  of 
these promises were never kept. 

So  I  come  here  to  speak  to  you  in  terms  of  the  overall  industry. 
And the overall industry, it must be noted, as we are talking about 
massive  losses,  airlines  going  into  bankruptcy.  All  of  the  airlines 
are not going into bankruptcy. Southwest Airlines, Continental Air-
lines,  and  American  Airlines  have  done  pretty  good  over  the  last 
7  years,  and  in  the  process  of  turmoil,  during  turmoil,  they  have 
been able to navigate through the system. 

Now  we  have  airlines  that  consistently  have  come  before  Com-
mittees  like  this,  before  the  Congress,  asking  for  relief,  Pension 
Protection  Act,  in  which  there  is  now  $7  billion  of  underfunded  li-
abilities  between  Delta  and  Northwest  Airlines.  Mountains  of  debt 
between these two carriers, and they come once again, always ask-
ing for relief. 

Since 9/11, airlines have received $6.3 billion worth of relief from 
the  Federal  Government,  and  employees  have  lost  billions  of  dol-
lars  in  wages  and  pensions  and  benefits.  Cities  that  used  to  be 
served  are  no  longer  served.  Small  communities  are  no  longer 
served. 

And so, we must ask ourselves, is this a problem of the industry, 
or is it a problem of some who have not managed properly through 
this turbulent time? We believe that with proper management, and 
we  believe  that  coming  to  the  table  with  management,  labor,  and 
the  Government  to  find  solutions  to  the  problems  that  we  do  con-
front  within  this  industry.  We  have  sought  that  type  of  meeting 
across  the  table  from  management.  Not  to  discuss  collective  bar-
gaining,  but  issues  that  are  of  concern  to  all  of  us  so  that  we  can 
jointly come before Congress or before the Department of Transpor-
tation with solutions to the problems. 

Creating  a  smaller  amount  of  airlines  we  do  not  believe  solves 
the  problems.  Eastern  Airlines  is  gone.  Braniff  Airlines  is  gone. 
TWA  is  gone.  Ozark  Airlines  is  gone.  People’s  Express  has  come 
and gone, and still they cry for more consolidation. 

Now  we  hear  one  rep  at  this  table  that  all  the  planes  are  going 
to fly, all the hubs are going to remain in place. And then we hear 
an analyst say we must reduce seat capacity. You can’t have it both 
ways. And if you put these airlines together, it is not going to drop 
the price of oil one nickel. 

Yes, there is a need for fuel, fuel price relief. And somewhere, we 
need to work on that particular situation. But there are some prob-
lems  that  we  have  sought—that  we  have  sought  across  the  table

with  others  to  find  solutions.  Again,  we  have  asked  for  meetings 
with management, the CEOs of the various major airlines through 
the ATA, and they fell on deaf ears. 

We have now contacted, at the request of Mr. Lou Dobbs of CNN, 
a  former  CEO,  Robert  Crandall.  And  while  we  do  not  agree  with 
everything  Mr.  Crandall  has  to  say,  we  believe  he  has  some  inter-
esting views on the industry today. And we hope to work as a part-
ner with Mr. Crandall and consumer advocates and people who are 
concerned  about  pensions  and  the  money  that  is  owed  to  the  Fed-
eral  Government  concerning  pensions  to  find  solutions  to  these 
problems  without  destroying  an  industry  that  some  of  us  have 
come  to  work  in  for  well  over  30  and  40  years  and  we  have  come 
to love. 

And  so,  as  our  remarks  are  in  the—will  be  placed  in  the  full 
record, we wanted to say that our conversation with Mr. Crandall, 
referring  to  an  article,  and  I  just  want  to  briefly  read  from  that 
New York Times article, April 21, 2008. 

Consolidation  will  not  resolve  the  woes  of  individual  carriers 
nor will it fix the Nation’s aviation problems. Delta and North-
west  Airlines  agreed  to  a  merger  last  week,  and  that  deal  is 
likely to be followed by other proposals. But the case for merg-
ers  is  unpersuasive.  Mergers  would  not  lower  fuel  prices.  It 
would not increase the economies of scale for these already siz-
able major airlines. 
It  will  create  large  costs  related  to  consolidation,  and  it  will 
anger  airline  employees  who  will  perceive  themselves  be  hurt 
by the merger. Although the system could conceivably be oper-
ated  by  a  single  efficient  carrier,  consumers  clearly  benefit 
from the existence of multiple carriers. The absence of competi-
tion never forces better consumer service. 

Again,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  would  ask  that  this  panel  or  other 
members  of  Government  would  try  to  help  us  with  a  format  to  sit 
down  and  really  try  to  fix  some  of  the  problems  that  confront  this 
industry. But we want to remind people every airline is not coming 
before  you  asking  for  mergers.  Some  of  them  are.  Some  of  them 
have  lost  focus  on  what  is  the  true  job  of  management,  and  that 
is to run the core business. 

And  every  time  I  come  here,  year  after  year,  it  is  always  for  a 
short-term fix, some relief, some billions of dollars to go back to the 
airlines, which never are passed on to the employees. We have poor 
customer service. It is time that we fix the problems instead of try-
ing  to  have  a  short-term  fix  that  only  provides  millions  and  mil-
lions of dollars to the people at the top of these airlines. 

So, again, we call for a meeting, a summit, a transportation sum-
mit.  We  will  work  with  anybody.  Again,  we  are  working  with  Mr. 
Crandall.  Hopefully,  we  can  come  to  some  format  so  we  can  find 
resolutions to these problems. 

I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to  come  before 

you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT ROACH, JR., GENERAL VICE PRESIDENT, 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS 

Thank you, Chairman Rockefeller, and Members of this Committee, for the oppor-
tunity to submit this testimony on behalf of airline workers throughout North Amer-
ica. My name is Robert Roach, Jr., General Vice President of Transportation for the 
International  Association  of  Machinists  and  Aerospace  Workers  (IAM),  the  largest 
airline  union  in  North  America.  I  am  submitting  this  testimony  on  behalf  of  Inter-
national President R. Thomas Buffenbarger. The IAM represents more than 110,000 
airline  workers  in  almost  every  job  classification,  including  flight  attendants,  ramp 
service workers, mechanics, customer service, reservation agents and office employ-
ees. 

It  is  my  firm  belief,  and  the  belief  of  many  others,  that  airline  executives  are 
using  a  crisis  of  their  own  making  to  justify  the  establishment  of  what  can  only  be 
called a monopoly. 
Regulation 

Airline  CEOs  regularly  complain  about  overcapacity,  but  they  are  the  ones  re-
sponsible for creating the problem, not passengers, not fuel prices and certainly not 
employees. 

The  need  to  address  overcapacity  has  been  a  favorite  battle  cry  for  airline  man-
agement  for  decades  and  won’t  be  resolved  by  mergers.  Braniff,  Eastern,  Pan  Am, 
TWA,  Peoples  Express,  Aloha  Airlines  and  others  have  all  disappeared  from  the 
scene. Reducing capacity will not overcome management’s failure to run a profitable 
business. 

The  Machinists  Union  is  not  advocating  that  we  maintain  the  status  quo  in  the 
airline  industry.  When  something  is  so  clearly  broken,  it  must  not  be  merely  ban-
daged,  but  completely  repaired.  Immediately  after  9/11,  airlines  demanded  more 
than  $6.3  billion  in  government  aid.  Carriers  then  sought  and  won  pension  relief 
legislation, but still abandoned their pension obligations. 

Airlines  also  used  the  bankruptcy  law  to  force  employees  and  shareholders  to 
make sacrifices to save the carriers. IAM members alone at Northwest Airlines, U.S. 
Airways,  United  Airlines,  Comair,  Hawaiian  Airlines  and  Aloha  Airlines  gave  up 
nearly $9 billion in bankruptcy to help their airlines. 

Even  with  all  this  aid,  this  troubled  industry  still  lost  $30  billion  from  2001  to 
2006.1 Airlines  are  constantly  asking  the  government  for  relief,  begging  the  courts 
to  abrogate  contracts  and  forcing  the  government  to  absorb  its  pension  obligations. 
History has shown that airlines cannot operate without government assistance. Air-
lines repeatedly appeal to the government for bailouts because the free market has 
failed  to  nurture  a  competitive  and  profitable  industry.  The  government  must  step 
in  and  put  an  end  to  the  charade  that  this  industry,  left  to  its  own  ridiculous  pat-
tern of suicidal business practices, can ever prosper. 

In 1993, the Clinton Administration recognized the problems facing the air trans-
portation industry. President Clinton empanelled a National Commission to Ensure 
a  Strong  Competitive  Airline  Industry,  and  one  of  my  predecessors,  IAM  General 
Vice President John Peterpaul, served on the Commission. The Commissioners were 
charged  with  investigating  and  devising  recommendations  that  would  resolve  the 
crisis in the airline industry and return it to financial health and stability. 

The  Committee  essentially  recommended  no  substantial  regulatory  changes  and 
believed  that  market  forces  would  stabilize  the  industry.  The  IAM’s  representative 
on  the  Commission  was  the  only  dissenter,  arguing  that  deregulation  destabilized 
the industry and government intervention was necessary. 

The  Machinists  Union’s  assertion  that  deregulation  had  failed  to  deliver  on  its 
promises  were  ignored  in  1993  in  favor  of  supporting  airline  industry  executives 
who advocated staying the course. Congress now has a second chance to make effec-
tive changes to this industry. If that opportunity is squandered again, bankruptcies 
will  increase,  more  proud  airlines  will  disappear,  employees  will  continue  suffering 
and passengers will be even further alienated. We can close our eyes and ignore mil-
lions  of  consumers,  employees  and  investors,  or  we  can  have  an  efficient  air  trans-
portation industry. More than 150 carriers have gone bankrupt since deregulation.2 
Instead  of  temporary  fixes,  long  term  solutions  are  required.  Airlines  today  com-
pete  by  cutting  standards,  eliminating  services  and  reducing  ticket  prices  to  the 
bone, which make a profitable industry impossible. The GAO estimates that median

ticket  prices  have  dropped  nearly  40  percent  since  1980,  although  the  costs  of  air-
craft, airport leases and fuel have increased dramatically.3 No business can survive 
if they sell their product for less than what it costs to deliver their goods. 

The  long-term  cost  of  under  pricing  tickets  is  too  extreme.  Pan  Am,  TWA,  East-
ern, and Aloha Airlines all survived for more than half a century, but could not en-
dure  the  insanity  of  deregulation.  This  industry  is  crying  out  for  sane  regulation 
that includes limiting capacity, setting fares or both. 
Effective Management 

Even  with  limited  re-regulation,  more  competent  management  is  needed  to  save 

the industry, not consolidation. 

If  airline  executives  spent  as  much  time  running  their  airline  as  they  do  looking 
for bailouts or mergers, this industry and our country’s transportation system would 
be much better off. 

Mergers  prevent  airlines  from  running  effective  operations.  United  Airlines 
emerged from bankruptcy with a plan to pay its executives undeserved multi-million 
dollar  bonuses,  but  with  no  intention  of  operating  the  airline.  Instead  of  finding 
ways  to  conserve  cash  and  operate  United  Airlines  in  times  of  record-high  fuel 
prices,  the  airline  paid  out  an  unnecessary  $250  million  dividend  to  shareholders 
in December 2007, against the objections from employees who warned against such 
reckless actions. This demonstrates that United’s only plan is to plunder the airline 
and market it for acquisition, to the detriment of passengers and employees. 

This  industry  is  in  disarray  and  the  executives  in  charge  are  only  making  things 

worse. 

Airlines  can’t  police  their  own  maintenance  programs,  small  communities  are 
under-served, passengers are treated like cattle and employees are continually being 
steamrolled. 

There  is  too  much  at  stake  to  let  executives  and  their  legacy  of  failure  try  and 
solve  the  industry’s  problems.  It  is  time  for  airline  passengers,  employees  and  the 
government to finally say ‘‘NO’’ to airline executives. 

Some form of limited re-regulation is necessary if this country has any chance for 
a  safe,  reliable,  profitable  and  competitive  air  transportation  industry.  And  I’m  not 
the only one calling for re-regulation. 

Although  I  do  not  agree  with  everything  former  American  Airlines  CEO  Robert 
Crandall says about the airline industry, I share his opinion that, ‘‘market-base ap-
proaches  alone  have  not  and  will  not  produce  the  aviation  system  our  country 
needs’’ and that ‘‘some form of government intervention is required.’’ 4 
Northwest-Delta 

Re-regulation  is  the  only  long-term  solution.  Today,  however,  we  must  deal  with 

immediate issues. 

One  factor  the  airlines  will  not  admit  publicly  is  that  they  expect  this  merger  to 
eliminate the union representation rights of Northwest Airlines workers. They want 
to  use  this  merger  as  a  weapon  to  eliminate  the  jobs  and  rights  of  thousands  of 
workers. The Machinists Union will not allow this to happen. 

An  issue  that  neither  Northwest  nor  Delta  have  addressed  is  how  they  will  deal 
with  current  pensions.  IAM  members  at  Northwest  Airlines  still  have  a  secure  de-
fined  benefit  pension  plan,  the  IAM  National  Pension  Plan.  Our  members  are  the 
only employees at either carrier still earning a traditional pension benefit, but that 
will be lost if our members lose IAM representation in a merger. Delta has not guar-
anteed that our members will not lose the security of a defined benefit pension plan 
in the merger. 

Additionally,  both  Delta  and  Northwest  have  frozen  or  terminated  their  pension 
plans.  If  a  merger  takes  place,  and  the  combined  carrier  ultimately  fails,  the  pen-
sions will be forced onto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). 

This will burden the PBGC with more than $7 billion in combined liabilities. The 

PBGC has already expressed concerns about such a scenario. 

Delta  and  Northwest  have  made  commitments  to  employees,  but  these  commit-
ments  are  unenforceable  and  subject  to  change.  If  the  combined  airline  wants  to 
make  a  true  commitment,  then  they  should  stop  interfering  with  Delta  employees’ 
right  to  organize,  and  make  their  commitments  part  of  collective  bargaining  agree-
ments that protect employees at the combined carrier. 

Northwest  and  Delta  say  that  no  frontline  workers  will  lose  their  jobs.  Don’t  be-
lieve  them.  If  Northwest  headquarters  is  downsized,  930  IAM-represented  clerical

workers,  are  at  risk.  The  frontline  employees,  not  the  high  level  management  em-
ployees, which Northwest has said are the only jobs at risk in a merger. 

Northwest  has  a  history  of  broken  promises.  The  State  of  Minnesota  bailed  out 
Northwest to the tune of $761 million in 1992. In return, Northwest Airlines prom-
ised  to  continue  employing  at  least  1,000  workers  in  Duluth,  Minnesota,  and  com-
mitted to building an engine maintenance facility in Duluth with a minimum of 500 
new  jobs.  Instead,  they  never  opened  the  engine  shop  and  closed  their  operation  in 
Duluth entirely in 2005. Additionally, Northwest committed to keeping employment 
levels  in  the  state  to  a  minimum  of  18,000  employees.  They  are  already  down  to 
about  12,000.  Northwest  Airlines  has  left  a  trail  of  broken  promises  throughout 
Minnesota  that  will  multiply  and  expand  throughout  the  country  if  this  merger  is 
approved. 

Delta also is not averse to making promises it doesn’t keep. Over the last 10 years 
the  airline  offered  employees  early  retirement  packages  based  principally  on  very 
attractive free or minimal cost health care programs. 

According  to  the  Delta  Air  Lines  Retirement  Committee,  retirees’  health  care 
deductibles  and  co-pays  were  increased  dramatically  after  accepting  the  packages 
and retiring. 

If  the  airlines  truly  cared  about  their  employees  they  would  have  engaged  all 
their  unions  when  they  first  contemplated  a  merger.  Instead,  they  rebuffed  our  ef-
forts to cooperate and have ensured labor turmoil for years to come, even if a merg-
er is not completed. 

Faced  with  inadequate  or  indifferent  responses  from  airline  management,  the 
IAM  has  contacted  Governors,  Senators  and  Representatives  as  part  of  our  efforts 
to protect the thousands of employees and dozens of communities that will be nega-
tively impacted by these proposed mergers. 
Seniority 

Delta  has  said  that  it  will  integrate  seniority  fairly,  and  that  they  are  required 
to  do  so  under  the  law.  But  what  does  ‘‘fairly’’  mean?  There  are  no  less  than  five 
recognized methods for ‘‘fair and equitable’’ integration of airline seniority lists. 

1.  The  surviving  group  principle,  where  the  acquiring  company’s  employees  re-
ceive seniority preference over the acquired employees; 
2.  The  follow-the-work-principle,  were  seniority  is  allocated  by  a  ratio  of  what 
assets each individual airline contributed to the combined company; 
3. The absolute rank principle, where employees retain their respective rank on 
the newly merged seniority list; 
4.  The  ratio-rank  principle,  where  a  ratio  of  the  employees  of  each  group  to  be 
merged  are  assigned  places  on  the  combined  seniority  list  according  to  a  ratio 
of total employees; and 
5.  The  length  of  service  principle,  where  all  employees  are  combined  by  their 
current seniority date, regardless of which airline they came from.5 

Fairness  is  in  the  eye  of  the  beholder,  and  what  Richard  Anderson  deems  fair  is 

not important. We need to focus on what employees consider to be fair. 

Northwest and Delta employees sacrificed wages, pensions and, in too many cases, 

their jobs to help their airlines survive bankruptcy. 

Mergers are another avenue for airlines to cut even more jobs. 
I  realize  this  hearing  was  prompted  by  the  Northwest  Airlines—Delta  Air  Lines 
merger announcement. However, we must recognize this announcement will lead to 
additional merger attempts. 

Continental  Airlines,  United  Airlines,  American  Airlines  and  U.S.  Airways  have 
all  discussed  various  pairings  and  alliances  in  response  to  the  Delta-Northwest  ac-
tion.  This  will  lead  to  other  mergers,  likely  cutting  the  number  of  major  national 
carriers in half, from six to three. 
Financial Health 

Both  Northwest  and  Delta  have  seen  their  stock  prices  sink  since  exiting  bank-
ruptcy,  and  more  so  since  the  merger  was  announced.  Passengers,  employees  and 
investors,  three  groups  with  different  concerns,  all  think  this  merger  is  a  bad  idea. 
If  the  two  airline  CEOs  testifying  today  can’t  independently  provide  their  cus-
tomers  and  shareholders  with  value  for  their  dollar,  what  will  happen  under  a 
merged company that is saddled with debt and even harder to manage? 

If  allowed  to  proceed,  Northwest  and  Delta  will  form  the  world’s  largest  airline, 
creating the world’s biggest corporate headache. According to the most recent Secu-

rities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  filings,  the  combined  carrier  would  have 
$15.7  billion  in  long-term  debt,  plus  $11.3  billion  in  current  liabilities  and  $14.23 
billion in non-current liabilities, including pension liabilities. This non-current liabil-
ities figure includes $7.51 billion in pension and retiree benefit liabilities. The total 
liabilities  of  the  combined  company  would  be  $40.55  billion.  It  is  not  in  this  coun-
try’s  best  interest  to  approve  the  creation  of  an  enormously  debt-ridden  company. 
Consumer Impact 

The  wholesale  reshaping  of  the  industry  will  destroy  competition  and  harm  con-

sumers on routes throughout the United States. 

It  would  be  difficult  to  find  anyone  outside  of  a  small  group  of  airline  executives 

who expect to benefit from additional airline consolidation. 

Passengers,  employees  and  shareholders  have  suffered  enough  by  senseless  man-

agement decisions. In the last month, four airlines have declared bankruptcy. 

We  have  seen  how  airlines  fail  to  comply  with  FAA-mandated  safety  compliance 

directives. Do we really need more instability in this chaotic industry? 

Both  Northwest  and  Delta  operate  a  hub  and  spoke  system.  Combining  the  two 
will create redundancies, which, if the airlines keep their promise not to close hubs, 
will create regional dominance. 

The  new  Delta  will  control  the  Southeast  and  Upper  Midwest  with  two  hubs  in 

each region. 

Atlanta and Memphis, less than 400 miles apart, will both be Delta hubs. 
Delta will also have two major hubs in Detroit and Cincinnati, less than 300 miles 
apart.  If  these  two  airlines  merge,  the  frequency  of  flights  between  cities  they  both 
serve will be diminished. 

It  is  both  insulting  and  a  testament  to  these  airlines’  arrogance  that  they  think 
anyone  believes  they  can  combine  these  two  companies  without  eliminating  service 
and purging employees. 

Passengers  originating  or  traveling  to  Memphis,  Detroit,  Cincinnati,  Minneapolis 
and the smaller communities served by airports in these cities will lose service fre-
quencies and pay higher fares. 

Experience  has  shown  us  that  commitments  made  by  airlines  in  bankruptcy  are 

absolutely worthless. 

When  American  Airlines  purchased  TWA  out  of  bankruptcy  in  2001,  promises 
were  made  to  TWA  employees.  American’s  then-CEO  Donald  Carty  testified  before 
the Senate Commerce Committee saying, ‘‘We look forward to adding TWA’s 20,000 
employees to the American Airlines family,’’ and that American was willing to make 
‘‘commitments  to  the  20,000  TWA  employees  and  their  families  that  no  one  else 
would make.’’ 6 

In spite of these assurances, the overwhelming majority of former TWA employees 

are no longer employed by American Airlines. 

Thousands of mechanics, ramp workers, customer service agents, flight attendants 
and  pilots  who  were  promised  careers  with  American  are  no  longer  working  in  the 
industry. 

We  also  cannot  count  on  Delta’s  promise  not  to  further  reduce  capacity  beyond 
already  announced  service  cuts.  American  Airlines  promised  the  City  of  St.  Louis 
that it would maintain TWA’s hub operation at Lambert Field after the TWA merg-
er. 

That  once  bustling  hub  had  over  474,000  flights  in  2000,  TWA’s  last  full  year  of 
operation.  In  2007  that  number  was  reduced  to  a  little  more  than  254,000.  Pas-
sengers  flown  have  been  reduced  nearly  in  half,  from  30.5  million  to  15.4  million 
in the same period.7 

With  the  loss  of  passengers  came  the  loss  of  tax  revenue  to  the  City  of  St.  Louis 

and income for the businesses that support the airport and service the airlines. 

Just over a year, ago Delta Air Lines was making the rounds in Washington try-

ing to block a merger proposal with U.S. Airways. 

Delta  said  then  that  ‘‘the  competitive  impact  of  the  U.S.  Airways  proposal  deal 
is  that  if  the  merger  were  to  go  forward,  it  would  trigger  broad  industry  consolida-
tion.’’ 8 Delta was right then, and wrong now. 

Both  Northwest  and  Delta  entered  bankruptcy  on  the  same  day  in  2005  to  make 

their companies leaner and more competitive. 

Since they are here today saying that they must merge to become profitable, their 

bankruptcy restructurings must have failed.

So why should we believe them when they say this merger will be a positive step 
for employees, consumers and shareholders? Too much is at stake to take these air-
lines at their word. 
Who Benefits? 

One final point, Mr. Chairman. 
Since employees, passengers and shareholders will lose in this merger, who bene-

Doug  Steenland  stands  to  gain  as  much  as  $19  million  due  to  the  ending  of  his 

fits? 

employment at Northwest. 

Richard Anderson has said he would wave the $15 million in merger-related com-
pensation  he  could  receive  due  to  change  in  control,  but  he  could  still  realize  tre-
mendous benefits through a new employment contract as the CEO of a much larger 
company. 

If employees lose their right to collectively bargain, if IAM members lose the new 
pensions  they  negotiated  in  bankruptcy,  if  employees  are  going  to  be  sacrificed  to 
grow executives’ personal bank accounts, then this merger will fail. 

A  Delta-Northwest  merger  will  eliminate  jobs,  reduce  choices  for  passengers,  fur-
ther  deteriorate  customer  service,  trigger  additional  senseless  mergers,  make  mil-
lionaires  even  richer,  and  most  importantly,  do  nothing  to  address  the  problems  of 
a failing industry. 

While  the  status  quo  is  unacceptable,  we  believe  that  consolidation  will  not 
produce  a  stable,  profitable  industry.  Instead,  consolidation  and  the  ensuing  reduc-
tion  in  service,  coupled  with  insanely  low  barriers  to  entry,  will  simply  produce  a 
variant of competition that is less reliable, less safe and more unstable. 

This merger and the ones that will follow should not be allowed to proceed. 
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Committee.  I  welcome  any 

questions. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Roach. 
And  our  final  witness  will  be  Mr.  Cooper,  who  is  the  Director  of 
Research  from  the  Consumer  Federation  of  America.  We  look  for-

STATEMENT OF DR. MARK COOPER, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, 
CONSUMER  FEDERATION  OF  AMERICA  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE 
CONSUMER  FEDERATION  OF  AMERICA  AND  CONSUMERS 
UNION 
Mr.  COOPER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Com-

The pending merger and those that are likely to follow it are an 
admission  of  failure,  a  clear  signal  that  the  industry  cannot  sup-
port  financially  healthy  airlines  while  remaining  vigorously  com-
petitive  across  the  Nation.  This  is  an  industry  that  truly  pleases 
no one. 

Consumers  are  frustrated  by  lousy  service  and  pricing  that  is  at 
best  erratic  because  competition  is  at  best  erratic.  Investors  are 
buffeted  by  a  boom  and  bust  cycle  and  a  low  rate  of  return  over 
the long term. Labor has been at war with the airlines for 30 years 
since  deregulation.  Unfortunately,  there  are  no  simple  solutions  to 
such a pervasive market failure. 

Delta and Northwest tell us that the merger won’t harm competi-
tion  because  they  don’t  compete.  But  that  is  because  they  either 
never  chose  to  compete  or,  worse  still,  have  recently  withdrawn 
from  competing  with  each  other.  The  bottom  line  is  simple,  how-
ever.  Consumers  do  not  have  competition  without  which  they  get 
abused.  And  if  they  are  telling  you  we  are  benefiting  from  their 
competition, you just listen to what your constituents say about the 
service they get.

Without vastly improved regulation, the mergers will do the pub-
lic  no  good.  All  the  promises  they  make  today  will  be  broken  in 
short  order,  and  the  consumer  will  have  fewer  choices,  higher 
prices,  and  crummier  service.  If  the  mergers  are  blocked,  without 
vastly improved regulation, the consumers will have fewer choices, 
higher prices, and crummier service. 

As  airlines,  and  I  quote,  ‘‘eliminate  duplicate  service,  shift  away 
from  competition,  and  scale  back  growth,’’  that  is  the  future,  and 
it is not very pretty. 

Emerging  from  another  wave  of  bankruptcies,  the  worst  on-time 
performance  in  history,  low-cost  carriers  going  bankrupt,  a  pro-
posal  for  a  merger  wave  among  network  industries,  it  is  time  for 
Congress  to  consider  the  proposition  that  this  industry  just  does 
not work as an unregulated market, to recognize that it is an infra-
structure industry that supplies essential inputs for growth and vi-
brancy  in  our  economy  and  one  that  must  provide  high-quality 
service to all corners of the Nation. 

Finally,  an  industry  that  relies  on  public  resources  for  its  exist-
ence, public airways and facilities that are supported by public dol-
lars  like  airports  and  air  traffic  control.  The  public  interest  is  not 
being served by the current model. 

Now we are not suggesting that we go back to price and quantity 
controls of the early history of the industry, but it is time to estab-
lish consumer rights and reform the incentive structure that exists 
in  the  industry  to  give  airlines  an  economic  incentive  to  serve  the 
public. 

In  many  cases,  individual  abuses  by  individual  airlines  are  not 
the  problem.  It  is  a  collective  problem,  a  shared  problem,  a  struc-
tural  problem.  Overscheduling  and  imprisoned  passengers,  for  ex-
ample, are perfect examples. The airlines share the blame, but they 
cannot solve the problem because they are unwilling to adjust their 
schedules  to  reduce  congestion  at  airports.  They  would  just  prefer 
to  publish  schedules  that  they  cannot  meet,  fraudulently  adver-
tising their product to the public. 

The  problem  of  passengers  imprisoned  on  airplanes  for  long 
hours will not be solved as long as standing in line is the way you 
allocate takeoff slots. They will sit there for hours for fear that they 
won’t lose their chance when it is time to go. We need some ground 
traffic  control.  We  need  end-to-end  traffic  control.  In  an  industry 
that  can  load  and  embark  an  airplane  in  an  hour,  why  are  people 
being held captive for 7 hours on the tarmac? It is an outrage. 

Obviously,  there  are  individual  problems  for  airlines—over-
booking,  lost  baggage—which  need  to  be  responded  to  with  protec-
tion  for  consumers.  Fines  that  make  it  really  painful  to  deliver 
crummy  service.  There  is  no  discipline  in  this  industry  for  poor 
service. These are just a few of the examples of the pervasive prob-
lem that I urge you to confront. 

Whether  or  not  these  mergers  are  approved,  unless  there  is  a 
substantial  improvement  in  regulatory  oversight,  the  industry  will 
continue to abuse the public because the competitive market forces 
are just too weak in many, many parts of the industry. 

So,  instead  of  holding  hearings  on  mergers,  I  urge  you  to  com-
mence a series of hearings on each of the problems that afflicts all 
aspects  of  the  industry—operations,  congestion,  slot  allocation,

landing fees, customer service, delays and schedule, tarmac holding 
time,  lost  bagging,  overbooking  and  bumping,  tickets  on  bankrupt 
airlines.  There  are  consumers  out  there  who  get  stuck  when  they 
go bankrupt. And market structure, abandonment of routes, essen-
tial service, and the real nature of competition. Yes, there is some, 
but  it  is  really  not  benefiting  the  vast  majority  of  the  traveling 
public. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Cooper follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  MARK COOPER,  DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH,  CONSUMER 
FEDERATION OF AMERICA ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA 
AND CONSUMERS UNION 
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, 
My name is Dr. Mark Cooper. I am Director of Research at the Consumer Federa-
tion of America. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to testify yet again on the seri-
ous  consumer  problems  with  the  airline  industry  and  commend  the  Committee  for 
holding  a  hearing  that  investigates  the  general  condition  of  the  industry.  I  appear 
today  on  behalf  of  the  Consumer  Federation  of  America 1 and  Consumers  Union.2 
This  is  truly  an  industry  that  makes  no  one  happy,  as  the  opening  paragraph  in 

a New York Times column put it recently 

What a time for airlines. Delays and cancellations. Oil more than $100 a barrel. 
Customers  are  furious  and  flight  crews  are  bedraggled.  And  that’s  before  the 
economic  slowdown  in  the  United  States  brings  its  won  misery.  Warren  E. 
Buffett once famously said of his fellow investors in the airline industry, ‘‘If we 
knew  then  what  we  know  now,  we’d  have  shot  the  Wright  Brothers  down.’’  (‘‘A 
Profitable 18 Hours That’s All Business,’’ Tuesday March 11, 2008, C–6) 

Consumers are frustrated by lousy service and pricing that is, at best erratic. In-
vestors are buffeted by boom and bust cycles. Emerging from another wave of bank-
ruptcies,  the  worst  on  time  performance  record  in  history,  and  confronted  with  a 
likely  merger  wave  that  would  reduce  the  number  of  major  carries  from  a  handful 
to a precious few, it is time for Congress to consider the proposition that this indus-
try  just  does  not  work  as  an  unregulated  market.  In  my  remarks  today  I  will  lay 
out  the  basic  causes  of  the  problem  and  give  some  initial  thoughts  about  the  solu-
tion,  but  my  primary  goal  is  to  convince  Congress  to  begin  asking  the  right  ques-
tions regarding endemic problems in the industry that must be addressed. The occa-
sional hearings, triggered by this or that merger, are not enough to solve these prob-
lems because they do not provide a proper context for the thorough policy rethinking 
that the industry needs and the public demands. 

From a policy point of view, the key factor is that competition is at best sporadic 
in  the  industry,  limited  to  a  small  subset  of  routes  and  metropolitan  areas,  pri-
marily on the on the coasts. Left to its own devises, the industry will over schedule 
take-offs and landings at the most competitive airports to drag customers to the air-
port  under  a  false  claim  about  when  they  will  leave  or  arrive.  They  get  away  with 
it  because  there  are  only  a  few  of  them  and  they  tend  to  do  it  en  mass.  There  is 
too little competition to punish the abusers. 

The  middle  of  the  country  is  dominated  by  fortress  hubs,  that  force  consumers 
into  additional  take-offs  and  landings  and  provide  the  trigger  points  for  cascading 
delays.  Consumers  not  only  have  longer  travel  times,  but  those  who  are  captive  to 
these hubs pay a heavy price in terms of higher fares on the many routes with little 
competition.

The  most  famous  of  the  cut-rate  competitors  has  just  been  hit  with  the  largest 
fine  in  the  history  of  the  industry  for  failing  to  properly  inspect  its  aging  fleet— 
aging  because  that  is  the  best  way  to  squeeze  a  little  profit  out  of  the  skies.  The 
most prominent of the recent new entrants into the industry has had repeated melt 
downs  of  service,  keeping  consumers  prisoner  on  planes  for  hours  on  end.  In  fact, 
they  all  keep  consumers  captive  on  planes  for  long  periods,  rather  than  risk  losing 
a  take-off  slot,  or  a  body  in  a  seat.  They  get  away  with  it  because  they  tend  to  do 
it en mass and there is too little competition to punish the abusers. 

It  is  time  to  rethink  public  policy  toward  the  airline  industry.  To  say  that  the 
thirty- year experiment in deregulation has been a wild ride would be a gross under-
statement.  When  a  market  performs  this  badly,  this  consistently,  from  every  point 
of  view—consumer,  investor  and  labor—it  is  time  to  consider  major  changes.  More 
and more, it appears that the original public policy judgment about the industry by 
policymakers  in  the  1930s,  that  it  is  destructively  competitive,  subject  to  vicious 
boom and bust cycles, and prone to exploitation of the consumer, was correct. 

Moreover, this is not just an industry that manufactures widgets. It is infrastruc-
ture  that  supplies  an  essential  input  to  other  industries  that  has  an  effect  on  the 
growth and vibrancy of regional and national economies. 

The  industry  is  also  fundamentally  dependent  on  public  resources  for  its  exist-
ence. It relies on the public airways, and facilities that are supported by public dol-
lars, airports and air traffic control, which reinforces the justification for more direct 
intervention  to  protect  the  public  from  the  abuse  it  suffers  at  the  hands  of  the  in-
dustry. 

The pending mergers and those that are likely to follow are an admission of fail-
ure. The industry cannot support financially healthy airlines with vigorous competi-
tion.  Delta  and  Northwest  tell  us  that  the  merger  won’t  harm  competition  because 
they don’t compete, in some cases they have withdrawn from competition with each 
other  over  the  past  few  years.  If  other  mergers  are  proposed,  and  rejected,  the  air-
lines will reduce their overlap and propose mergers down the road. In the end, con-
sumers  have  less  and  less  competition.  Without  vigorous  competition  the  abuse  of 
consumers will continue and become worse. 

Nobody wants to go back to price and quantity controls, but the industry has lost 
it  right  to  be  unregulated  by  consistently  abusing  the  traveling  public.  A  consumer 
bill  of  rights  would  be  helpful,  but  if  we  do  not  change  the  incentive  structure  and 
back it up with energetic enforcement by public authorities, it will not lead to long- 
term  solutions  to  the  vast  problems  I  have  detailed.  In  many  cases,  individual 
abuses  by  individual  airlines  are  not  the  problem;  it  is  the  overall  structure  that 
is. 

Dealing  with  delays  and  cancellations—weather,  mechanical  or  economic—is  a 
delicate  problem.  We  never  want  an  unsafe  plane  to  take  off  or  a  safe  one  to  take 
off  in  unsafe  conditions.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  practices  that  abuse  the 
public  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  difficult  question  of  safety  versus  service. 
Over-scheduling  is  a  perfect  example,  where  all  airlines  share  the  blame  and  the 
solution is a reduction of all schedules proportionate to the number of flights. They 
will  not  voluntarily  solve  the  problem  and  they  certainly  should  not  be  allowed  to 
publish  schedules  that  they  cannot  meet.  The  FAA  should  respond  quickly  and  ag-
gressively to over-scheduling. A landing slot is a perishable commodity whose value 
varies widely between airports and over the course of a day. The allocation of those 
slots  to  users  should  reflect  their  value.  The  public  will  benefit  much  more  from  a 
systematic approach to the problem, than the sporadic, after the fact fixes that have 
been applied in the past. The airlines would initially be free to set schedules as they 
like,  but  if  they  behaving  badly  and  produce  situations  of  chronic  over-scheduling, 
then  the  regulator  would  shape  the  traffic  curve  adjusting  the  fee  structure  and/or 
administratively reducing the number of flights at congested airports/times. The re-
ductions  in  flight  should  be  spread  across  all  airlines  that  have  shown  chronic 
delays. 

Imprisoned  passengers  are  a  similar  collective  problem  that  demands  a  collective 
solution. The problem of passengers imprisoned on airplanes for long hours will not 
be solved as long as standing in line is the way we allocate take-off slots. An indus-
try that manages thousands of planes moving hundreds of miles an hour in the air 
at one time ought to be able to manage dozens of planes standing still on the ground 
at  an  airport  better.  When  it  takes  half  an  hour  to  load  and  embark  a  plane,  it  is 
absurd that people should be forced to sit on runways for hours because the airline 
does not want to lose its place in the queue. The regulator should institute queuing 
policies that do not reward, perhaps even punish, airlines for keeping people sitting 
on the tarmac for excessive periods of time.

Overbooking and lost baggage are individual airline issues that can be dealt with 
by  improving  consumer  rights.  If  the  penalties  are  stiffened,  the  individual  airlines 
will have more incentive to do a better job. 

In  the  long  run,  expanding  capacity  will  enable  the  airlines  to  better  serve  the 
public, but if we expand capacity without reforming the incentive structure, the in-
dustry  will,  soon  enough,  recreate  existing  problems.  Capacity  or  the  lack  thereof 
is  not  the  cause  of  the  current  problem.  The  irresponsibility  of  the  airline  industry 
is  the  problem.  It  is  the  failure  of  the  industry  to  offer  service  to  the  public  that 
fits within the capacity of the current system—air traffic control and airport landing 
slots—that  harms  the  public.  If  you  build  it,  without  setting  new  rules,  they  will 
come and come and come until it is overburdened. 

Again  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  express  the  consumers’  frustration  with 
the airline industry and urge you to undertake a top-to-bottom review of its market 
failure.  The  Consumer  Federation  of  America  looks  forward  to  assisting  you  in  any 
way we can in that important endeavor. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Cooper. 
I  guess  I  would  put  aside  a  couple  of  the  questions  I  was  going 
to  ask  and  say  that  this  doesn’t  sound  to  me  automatically  like  a 
group  full  of  comity  that  wishes  to  exchange  views  to  work  on  an 
airline—aviation policy. 

As Chair, I wish to point out that this hearing was called for the 
purpose of looking at the overall situation of the aviation industry. 
Obviously,  we  have  people  representing  different  parts  of  that  in-
dustry,  and  they  have  every  right  to  express  their  views.  But  the 
point of this hearing is to figure out what needs to be done to make 
the aviation system work. 

Senator  Hutchison  and  I  spent  the  better  part  of  the  last  week 
or  10  days  giving  endless  speeches  about  the  failure  of  airlines  to 
hold  on  to  their  operating  margins  and,  therefore,  go  into  Chapter 
11, merge, or go into Chapter 7. 

I can remember when I started off in Charleston, West Virginia, 
we  had  jets  from  American  Airlines,  United  Airlines,  and  Eastern 
Airlines. We deregulated the industry, and within 4 days, that was 
the  end  of  all  the  jets  to  Charleston.  So  I  don’t,  frankly,  discount 
myself entirely from the consideration of re-regulation of the airline 
industry. I am very sincere in that. 

I  also  am  very  sincere  in  my  understanding  that  the  folks  that 
run these airlines, who I know pretty well, in addition to those who 
work  for  the  airlines,  are  doing  everything  they  can  to  try  and 
make it work. It has been said by a number of people that at least 
40 percent of all of the cost for an airline is fuel, and that is a pret-
ty hard number to bear. 

Ms. Friend, I noticed that when you were giving your testimony, 
you referred to making things work for the customers, for the com-
munities, and for the workers. You didn’t mention the airlines. We 
had  a  discussion  once  before,  and  it  strikes  me  as  not  uncommon 
to  think  that  unless  the  airlines  are  working  or  unless  all  of  the 
money  that  you  indicate  that  is  being  paid  to  senior  executives  is 
the cause for these mergers or failures or droppings off and trouble 
in the marketplace, but that troubles me. 

That  troubles  me  because  the  question  is,  are  you  here  because 
you really want to look at new aviation policy—which Mr. Neidl re-
ferred to, or are you here to express your complaints? And you are 
totally  free  to  do  that.  You  came  on  your  own,  and  you  are  free  to 
say  whatever  you  want.  But  I  really  would  like  to  figure  out  how

53 

we  can  make  this  aviation  industry  work  and  complaints  do  not 
help with that. 

We have failed over the last week in being able to pass the Fed-
eral aviation bill. I won’t go into the reasons for that, but they are 
fairly  stark.  And  so,  I  would  just  wonder  if  you  agree  that  dis-
cussing aviation policy means that, in fact, we somehow have to get 
ourselves  to  the  table,  maybe  some  of  us  in  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  and  aviation  experts  need  to  be  involved,  and  take  some  of 
these things head on. 

I  am  always  fascinating  by  the  charge,  because  it  is  so  enticing, 
that  you  take  what  somebody  is  being  paid,  and  then  whatever  is 
going  wrong  with  the  aviation  system,  that  is  the  answer.  If  we 
just stop doing that, everything would sort of clear up. 

So,  I  am  not  going  to  ask  a  question  right  now.  I  have  many  I 
want  to  ask.  But  I  am  perplexed  a  little  bit  by  the  nature  of  what 
I heard, and I am very sincere. I cherish this Subcommittee. I cher-
ish the whole concept of aviation. 

I  cherish  the  concept  of  when  it  was  working  well,  and  I  am  in 
agony  these  days,  coming  from  a  small  state  like  West  Virginia, 
when  it  isn’t  working  as  well  and  when  people  are  having  to  do 
things  which  bring  out  in  some  ways  the  worst  in  them  and  turn 
them  into  competitors,  although  they  are  all  working,  I  think,  sin-
cerely toward making the aviation system work. 

But  that  was  not  my  first  impression,  I  guess,  from  the  first 
round  of  statements,  and  I  will  simply  say  that  and  then  call  on 
Senator Lautenberg. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Ms.  Friend,  what  needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  workers’  rights  to 

unionize after this merger is done? 

Ms.  FRIEND.  Well,  what  we  would  like  to  see  is  a  level  playing 
field  where  the  flight  attendants,  the  Delta  flight  attendants  that 
are currently voting are allowed to do so without influence by man-
agement, that they are allowed to freely make a decision, that they 
are  not  flooded  with  information,  with  flashy  folders  and  DVDs 
that  explain  to  them  how  evil  AFA  is  and  how  they  deceive  them 
and tell them lies. 

Quite frankly, Senator, our ideal would be that the National Me-
diation  Board  revise  their  archaic  rules  that  set  a  threshold  that 
50  percent  plus  1  of  the  eligible  unit  must  participate  in  order  for 
them  to  form  a  union.  It  is  my  belief  that  if  we  applied  that  same 
arbitrary standard to our Federal laws, that this building would be 
mostly  empty  and  that  we  should  have  a  simple—in  choosing 
whether  or  not  to  form  a  union,  we  should  have  a  simple  yes/no 
ballot.  And  those  who  choose  to  participate  would  make  that  deci-
sion just as they make the decision in our Federal elections. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Anderson,  just  a  question.  You  have 
heard  the  response  that  Ms.  Friend  gave  us.  Now,  some  part  of 
Delta is unionized. I believe the pilots, if I am not mistaken. 

Mr. ANDERSON. And the dispatchers. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. And the dispatchers. There is a significant 

part of the workforce that is not? 

Mr. ANDERSON. That is correct, Senator.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  What  do  you  see  the  outcome  of  a  merger 
here  in  terms  of  the  evidence  or  whatever  that  Ms.  Friend  has?  I 
say ‘‘whatever.’’ Is that a piece that is put out by Delta? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  The  company—the  way  we  approach  it,  Delta  is 
a  very  unique  place.  If  you  look  at  its  history—if  you  look  at  its 
history, it has long had a very good relationship with its employees, 
and  that  is  important  to  Delta.  It  has  very  high  service  standards 
and  very  high  ratings  in  terms  of  its  service,  J.D.  Powers  ratings. 
And  so,  we  respect  the  NMB  process,  and  the  NMB  process  es-
sentially  lays  out  through  the  course  of  a  merger,  it  has  happened 
many times in the industry. Oftentimes the process is between two 
different unions. And the employees go through a selection process 
after  the  National  Mediation  Board  makes  the  determination  of  a 
single carrier. And we are respectful of that process. 

At  the  same  time,  if  you  look  at  what  Delta  has  done,  Delta,  as 
an  airline,  has  never  had  a  single  strike.  It  has  never  had—the 
first time it had a layoff in 80 years was at 9/11. So it has a special 
relationship,  and  we  respect  both  the  employees  at  the  company 
that  have  decided  they  are  going  to  be  a  member  of  the  union, 
ALPA or the dispatchers union, or have decided that they are going 
to be non-union. 

And we think that the National Mediation Board process lays out 
very clear ways for what they call the laboratory conditions for se-
lecting  whether  or  not  a  group  of  employees  wants  to  be  rep-
resented by a union. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Have  you  seen  the  material  that  Ms. 

Mr. ANDERSON. I am sure I have seen some of it, yes. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Is  that  a  Delta  product?  Is  it  something 

Friend—— 

that Delta—— 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  It  is  both.  There  are  employee  grassroots  cam-
paigns on both sides of this issue, and there are very many employ-
ees at the company that feel very strongly both ways. 

And the NMB, we respect the NMB process to be certain that we 
have the laboratory conditions and that we respect that process. So 
the  collective  bargaining  agreements  that  are  in  place  for  both  the 
Delta  employees  and  the  Northwest  employees  will  be  honored 
after the merger closes. 

And  then  we  go  through  the  regular  process  of  determining 
whether  there  will  be  representation  or  not  among  the  different 
classes and crafts of employees. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  if  there  was  an  attempt  to  unionize 
the  non-union  portion  of  your  work  force,  would  Delta  resist  that? 
Mr.  ANDERSON.  We  would—we  would  put  information  out  to  be 
certain  that  there  is  a  fair  and  open  election  between  the  two 
groups.  And  we  have  respected  that  in  the  past,  and  we  will  re-
spect it in the future. We have tried very hard to create a positive 
work environment at Delta. 

If  you  look  across  the  board,  pretty  much  the  Delta  employees 
have  always  been  among  the  higher  paid,  with  better  work  rules 
and  better  work  benefits.  And  we  are  committed  to  continuing  to 
do that whether we are unionized or not unionized because, in the 
end, if you take care of your employees—and that has always been 
the  philosophy,  going  back  to  the  founder  of  Delta,  Mr.  Woolman.

If you take care of your employees, they will take care of your cus-
tomers. 

And  the  employees  of  Delta  have  been  through  a  lot.  Employees 
at  Northwest  have  been  through  a  lot,  and  what  we  are  trying  to 
do here is create something positive for the employees that creates 
a  more  durable  franchise  so  that  we  don’t  have  to  come  back  to 
them  for  concessions.  These  employees  have  been  through  enough 
of  that.  And  what  our  hope  is  is  that  by  providing  equity  and  se-
niority  protection  and  making  this  an  end-to-end  transaction,  that 
it can be positive for both of the employee groups. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Is  it  not  likely  that  some  redundancy 
would follow a merger? There are always reasons that, say, redun-
dancy is one of the things typically the companies talk about when 
they merge. You know, I came from the business background. 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Right.  A  very  successful  business,  I  might  add. 
There are. But what we have really tried to do and the reason why 
this works is we are end-to-end. We don’t have very much overlap. 
So  when  you  look  at  the  places  that  Delta  serves  and  the  places 
that  Northwest  serves,  for  the  frontline  employees,  we  can  put  a 
transaction together that protects them. 

The redundancies come in the overheard of the company and the 
corporate  headquarters  and  in  what  you  will  remember  as  SG&A. 
It is those redundancies that we have to work through in a respect-
ful  way  to  create  the  synergies  that  allow  us  to  be  a  stronger  air-
line. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks very much. 
Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. 
Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. 
I  described  earlier  about  how  Northwest  Airlines  has  been  such 
a vital part of our state. I will also say that if Northwest has been 
good  to  Minnesota,  our  State  has  been  good  in  return.  In  1992, 
when  Northwest  was  threatened  by  rising  fuel  costs  and  an  eco-
nomic  recession,  our  State  leaders  approved  a  loan  package  worth 
more  than  $300  million  in  exchange  for  Northwest’s  promise  to 
build new facilities in Minnesota. 

And  more  recently,  when  Northwest  faced  financial  difficulties, 
our Metropolitan Airports Commission granted it millions of dollars 
in  rent  reductions.  I  would  also  add  that  after  these  efforts,  they 
came on top of a $15 billion financial rescue package that Congress 
created in 2001 to help the airline industry after 9/11. 

So  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  the  people  of  my  state  and  this 
country have been good partners with the airline industry, as have 
their  employees  who  have  taken  a  number  of  concessions,  many 
times  great  reductions  in  their  salaries  in  the  last  few  years.  So 
one  of  the  things  that  I  want  to  focus  on  today  just  is  some  of  the 
promises  that  have  been  made  to  the  employees  and  to  the  people 
of my state about this merger. 

Earlier,  at  a  Judiciary  Committee  hearing  that  I  sat  in  on,  I  fo-
cused  more  globally  on  my  concerns  that  Ms.  Friend  raised  that 
this  merger  not  be  looked  at  in  isolation  by  the  Justice  Depart-
ment, that they look at this as a whole and not look at it in a vacu-
um.  But  today,  with  the  first  round  of  questions  here,  I  wanted  to

focus on some of the promises and statements that have been made 
about how this will be I think the quote was ‘‘a merger of addition 
and not subtraction’’ from Mr. Anderson and Mr. Steenland. 

So my first question was about, again, a Minnesota-specific ques-
tion. There are at least 450 Northwest employees who work in the 
Chisholm,  Minnesota,  reservation  center  and  around  400  employ-
ees  who  work  in  the  Bloomington,  Minnesota,  reservation  center. 
And I was hoping you could make a commitment to maintain both 
the Chisholm and the Bloomington reservation centers. Can you do 
that? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  I  actually  built  the  Chisholm  reservation  center. 
So it has a certain fondness. So, yes, both of those res centers will 
stay open. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And can you commit to the current level of 

staffing at the Chisholm and the Bloomington centers? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  I  think  the  commitment  we  have  made,  it  may 
go higher. But if it has to go lower at any time, it won’t be because 
of involuntary. But I think we are pretty comfortable in saying that 
the current levels that we have there in those two facilities will re-
main the same. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  how  long  can  you  make  that  commit-

ment for with these two facilities? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  I  know  that  with  the  Chisholm  facility, 
there is actually a specific covenant that runs out, but I would use 
the  term  indefinite.  I  mean,  I  think  the  great—going  back,  there 
is  an  area  where  we  all  do  agree  here,  which  is  the  industry  has 
been under real distress, and the great unknown that really makes 
it  very  difficult  to  plan  and  to  run  an  airline  is  when  fuel  prices 
go up. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Although we did discuss at the last hearing 
how  the  fuel  prices  right  now  are  high.  They  may  go  higher,  but 
that the combined airline is not going to be able to negotiate better 
fuel prices. 

Mr. ANDERSON. That is correct. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. I just want to make that point. 
Mr.  ANDERSON.  You  also  made  some  good  points  about  the  need 

for an energy policy, which we—— 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  We  did.  That  was  a  good  discussion.  We 
can  have  it  again  maybe  in  a  few  hours,  but  the  thing  that  I  am 
trying to get at now—so it is an indefinite commitment? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Yes,  there  is  no  plans.  Let  me  just  run  through 
the different facilities that we have talked about at different points 
in  time  with  you  and  with  the  Governor  and  I  think  that  we  have 
been pretty open about. One is the reservation facility in Chisholm 
and  the  reservation  facility  in  Minneapolis.  Second  is  the  pilot 
base.  Third  is  the  flight  attendant—or  I  guess,  fourth  is  the  flight 
attendant base. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Right.  And  there  are  2,200  flight  attend-

ants based in the Twin Cities. 

Mr. ANDERSON. Right. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. And 1,000 aviation mechanics, and then the 

pilot training facility. 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  At  NATCO.  And  then  the  simulator  technicians 
that  support  those.  Those,  plus  the  data  center  in  Eagan,  Min-

nesota,  are  all  included  in  what  we  intend  on  keeping  in  Min-
nesota. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  So  the  1,000  aviation  mechanics,  2,200 
flight  attendants,  the  pilot  training  facility  in  Eagan,  the  employ-
ees working at Northwest cargo facilities? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  The  cargo  facility  at  the  airport,  the  building  at 

the cargo facility. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. And the information services, the data cen-
ter  or  customer  service  operation—and  customer  service?  So  those 
are all the same answer? 

Mr. ANDERSON. Correct. Correct. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. And then, how about the 1,100 employ-

ees who work at Northwest Airlines headquarters in Eagan? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  We  have  not—we  have  just  kicked  off  the  inte-
gration  effort  of  putting  together  the  two—the  two  headquarters 
staff. Actually, we had our first session. So there will be reductions 
there.  We  have  been  clear  about  that  because  the  headquarters  is 
moving  to  Atlanta.  But  we  haven’t  done  a  bottoms-up  and  really 
analyzed  what  makes  sense  to  move  and  what  makes  sense  not  to 
move. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I  think  you  said  at  the  Judiciary  Com-
mittee hearing that the cuts could be made to both the Twin Cities 
headquarters and the Atlanta headquarters? 

Mr. ANDERSON. Yes, because what you really have to do, as hard 
as  it  is  and  as  much  as  you  don’t  like  to  do  it  and  as  much  as  we 
are going to try to mitigate it with early out programs and the like, 
in  order  to  get  the  economies  of  scale  that  it  takes  to  develop  the 
benefits, you really have to sort of move to one overhead structure, 
and  we  have  really  committed  to  do  a  best  in  breed  process  to 
doing that. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. I think, Mr. Steenland, do you want to? 
Mr.  STEENLAND.  I  think  if  I  could  just  make  one  point  with  re-
spect to this, and that is the only thing that we know is the world 
that  we  see  today.  And  obviously,  we  can  make  judgments  and  we 
can make observations based on that world. But, for example, yes-
terday  Goldman  Sachs,  one  of  the  leading  sort  of  oil  trading  firms 
in  the  world,  came  out  with  a  prediction  that  said,  in  their  judg-
ment, oil was going to rise to $200 a barrel. 

Now, if that happens, clearly, airfares are going to have to go up 
in  a  very  significant  way.  If  airfares  go  up  in  a  very  significant 
way, by definition of the laws of supply and demand, we are going 
to  have  fewer  passengers.  If  we  have  fewer  passengers,  we  prob-
ably  need  fewer  reservation  agents  to  take  calls.  We  are  going  to 
need  to  have  fewer  flights  because  we  have  fewer  people  to  carry. 
So in terms of making commitments as to numbers of people, we 
have  to  recognize  that  there  are  variables  out  there  that  are  com-
pletely  outside  of  our  control  that  could  well  change  that  dynamic, 
and it doesn’t mean that we were misleading. It doesn’t mean that 
we were sort of not truthfully stating what we saw today. It means 
that  there  has  been  a  sea  change,  a  change  in  the  external  world 
that changes how this business needs to be run if it is going to stay 
in business, and we will have to make adjustments accordingly. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  But  at  this  point,  you  are  committing  to 
keep these groups—the 1,000 aviation mechanics, the 2 reservation

centers,  the  2,200  flight  attendants—this  is  like  the  partridge  in 
the pear tree—the pilot training facility in Eagan, Northwest cargo 
facilities, the information services data center, customer service op-
erations,  and  then  you  are  looking,  but  you  are  not  committing  to 
the corporate headquarters employees? 

Mr. ANDERSON. And a partridge in a pear tree.

as I look at our employees. 

minute? Thank you. 

Would  you  mind,  Chairman,  if  Mr.  Roach  just  responded  for  1 

Mr.  ROACH.  I  have  been  in  this  industry  33  years,  and  I  have 
never  seen—I  have  heard  a  lot  of  these  promises,  and  as  Mr. 
Steenland was saying, I think we need to hear them loud and clear. 
In  the  transportation  industry,  there  is  nothing  constant  but 
change. 

And so, commitments that are made today will mean nothing to-
morrow.  And  clearly,  I  have  been  through  a  number  of  them.  And 
I  have  seen  we  are  going  to  keep  this  facility.  We  are  going  to  do 
this,  that,  that,  and  that.  Maybe  they  put  it  in  writing  to  you,  so 
you  have  a  piece  of  paper  that  may  mean  something.  But  it  really 
don’t hold water down the road the same way like TWA and Ozark 
Airlines and those type of mergers. 

But I would like to go back to something Senator Rockefeller said 
about  we  need  a  format  to  talk  about  this  issue,  but  to  talk  about 
the overall industry. That is what we need to be doing because the 
overall industry does have some problems. 

And what is happening here is that people are focusing on North-
west/Delta, which we think is a problem, but the industry needs to 
sit  down—management,  labor,  and  Government  to  sit  down  talk 
about  what  is  needed  to  fix  the  problems  because  we  have  pas-
senger  problems.  We  have  employee  problems.  We  have  airlines 
that  cannot  make  money,  and  there  are  serious  problems  within 
the industry. 

And  we  have  since  2001,  I  have  the  letters  here,  we  have  at-
tached  them  to  our  other  testimony,  in  attempting  to  have  that 
type  of  format  in  order  to  fix  the  problem  so  that  we  don’t  wind 
up with ourselves in these constant consolidation, band-aid, borrow 
money from the Government type situation. 

I  just  want  to  say  that  is  a  good  idea,  and  we  need  to  work  on 
that  and  getting  that  format  together.  And  the  machinists  union 
will  be  certainly  in  the  forefront  of  working  with  any  Government 
official or company officials to get that done. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  Mr.  Anderson  could  maybe  respond 
the  next  time  I  ask  questions.  I  know  I  have  gone  way  over  my 
time here. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  think  you  have  done  pretty  well,  Sen-

ator Klobuchar. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  I  will  continue  on.  This  is  a  very  im-
portant  thing  for  our  State  and  for  our  employees  and  the  hub  as 
well. 

Mr. ANDERSON. And we agree with you. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  mean,  that  is  kind  of  a  record-breaking 

list of commitments.

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  it  is.  And  as  we  know  and  have  ac-
knowledged, things can change. But it is good to get those commit-
ments right now. But we have other questions to ask as we go for-
ward, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  And  you  will  have  a  chance  to  ask  them. 

I simply was impressed by your tenacity. 

Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
First  of  all,  I  am  skeptical  of  mergers.  That  is  not  a  surprise.  I 
don’t think we solve the problems of the airlines by getting bigger. 
And  I  think,  generally  speaking,  it  is  axiomatic  that  more  con-
centration means less competition. 

I  want  to  just  make  a  couple  of  comments  and  ask  a  couple  of 
questions.  Mr.  Murphy,  you  indicated  that  your  study  shows  more 
competition  that  at  any  time  in  history.  Maybe  not  in  some  parts 
of  the  country.  I  will  show  some  charts  that  respond  to  that  in  a 
moment. 

Mr. Neidl, you said that in Europe there is much greater consoli-
dation,  and  therefore,  we  need  to  merge  in  this  country  or  allow 
mergers in this country so that we can compete. As I was thinking 
about  that,  we  have,  I  think,  six  network  carriers  in  this  country. 
If that is the urge and the issue, maybe we should not take a half 
a  dose  of  medicine.  Instead  of  going  from  six  to  five,  maybe  we 
should go from six to three? 

Because  I  think  there  are  a  couple  pairs  of  other  mergers  out 
there,  and  so  I  don’t  think  we  look  at  this  in  just  a  vacuum.  And 
I am not prepared to accept your notion that because there is more 
concentration in Europe, we must have more concentration here at 
home. But that is what I heard you say. 

The  question  for  me  is  either  post  merger  or  even  today,  what 
is the service level? We need commercial air service in this country. 
It  is  critical  to  this  country’s  economy,  essential  to  our  economy. 
We need good airline service. So what is the service level, and how 
is it priced? Those are the questions for me. 

And  so,  I  came  to  work  this  morning.  I  met  with  Mr.  Steenland 
yesterday. I met with Mr. Anderson and Mr. Steenland previously, 
and I appreciate your being open to visit with all of us, and we are 
going  to  visit  again.  But  I  came  to  work  early  this  morning,  and 
I  went  on  Orbitz—I  think  both  of  you  probably  own  a  part  of 
Orbitz. I know Northwest does. 

Mr. ANDERSON. Use to. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Use  to.  All  right.  Well,  I  went  on  Orbitz,  and 
I  decided  I  was  going  to  check  and  see  what  it  is  going  to  cost  me 
to fly. So I plugged in three dates. I just want to show you the re-
sult. 

I said let us go from D.C. to Bismarck on June 16. I just plugged 
in  these  dates  just  for  the  heck  of  it.  That  is  a  Monday,  coming 
back  Thursday.  D.C.  to  Bismarck,  $860.  D.C.  to  Grand  Forks, 
North  Dakota,  $860.  Same  days  I  would  like  to  go  to  Los  Angeles, 
$380—twice as far and half as much. I want to go to San Francisco,

$568.  I  want  to  go  to  Seattle,  $440.  So  fly  twice  as  far,  you  get  to 
pay half the cost.

Senator DORGAN. So then I thought, well, let us just go into Sep-
tember. I mean, this is way down the road. This is way in advance, 
and same thing, Monday come back on a Thursday, about the same 
thing.  D.C.  to  Bismarck,  $888.  Grand  Forks,  about  the  same.  D.C. 
to Los Angeles, $343. Seattle, $314.

Senator  DORGAN.  So  I  said,  well,  maybe  it  has  to  have  a  Satur-
day  night  stay  because  we’ve  got  to  keep  the  hotels  full.  And  so, 
I  put  in  September  15  through  22  so  I  am  out  there  7  days.  And 
here is what it looks like, a little better actually. But you still pay 
$538  roundtrip  to  Bismarck,  $481  roundtrip  to  Grand  Forks.  And 
then go twice as far, you get to pay less money. 

Senator  DORGAN.  And  my  point  with  showing  you  those  graphs 
is very simply some of us in some regions of this country, Mr. Mur-
phy,  don’t  believe  for  a  minute—don’t  believe  for  a  minute—that 
this has really been nirvana for us. What a wonderful thing. What 
robust competition. That is not the case. 

And  when  I  say  that,  I  understand  the  hub  and  spoke  system  is 
an  essential  system  for  getting  people  from  a  Bismarck  or  a  Sioux 
Falls  to  a  hub,  to  move  one  stop  to  anywhere  else  in  the  world.  I 
understand that. But I also believe that the pricing has upset a lot 
of  folks  in  some  parts  of  this  country  that  no  one  at  this  table 
speaks  of.  You  just  speak  of  the  larger  picture.  If  you  live  in  Chi-
cago,  Los  Angeles,  New  York,  good  for  them.  They  have  got  a  lot 
of choices, and they have got low prices. Good for them. 

The  fact  is  in  many  areas  of  the  country,  we  don’t.  I  don’t  have 
an  airline  name  up  here,  but  I  used  this  example  this  morning  to 
figure  out  what  is  it  going  to  cost  to  fly  to  these  areas?  And  you 
know,  all  of  you  know  that  you  will  find  the  same  thing  if  you  go 
to Orbitz. 

My  time  must  be  close  to  up,  but  let  me  just  mention  addition-
ally,  I  sat  in  this  room  hearing  United  wanting  to  take  over  U.S. 
Air.  I  sat  in  this  room  listening  to  U.S.  Air  wanting  to  take  over 
Delta.  We  had  Delta  employees  in  the  room  then.  I  was  visited  by 
Delta  later  thanking  me  very  much  for  opposing  the  merger.  That 
wasn’t too long ago.

And  I  heard  all  four  of  those  carriers—I  heard  all  four  of  those 
carriers  say  that  this  will  be  complementary,  end-to-end,  and  they 
used  a  word  you  all  didn’t  use.  They  used  and  overused  the  word 
‘‘synergy.’’  You  didn’t  use  that,  and  so  I  think  you  can  make  that 
case, perhaps either more or less, with most mergers, proposals be-
tween the top six. 

But  having  said  all  that,  so  I  can  explain  to  you  why  I  am  a  bit 
skeptical and where I come from, I want to ask you ask you about 
oil prices. Oil prices are killing you, and I don’t think this is going 
to  solve  an  oil  price  issue,  no.  You  are  still  going  to  run  fuel 
through your planes. 

What  have  you  done  about  oil  prices?  When  you  have  set  the 
labor  costs,  I  watched.  And  you  go  at  them  and  you  have  got  to 
deal  with  labor  costs,  you  cut  labor  costs  and  so  on.  But  you  have 
got  to  buy  oil.  So  what  kind  of  pressure  are  you  putting  on  those 
that are taking your money to the bank and depositing that in the 
name of Exxon or Saudi Arabia? 

And  there  are  things,  it  seems  to  me,  as  an  industry  you  could 
do.  For  example,  we  are  putting  70,000  barrels  of  oil  underground 
every  day  in  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve  that  is  sweet  light 
crude.  That  is  the  most  valuable  subset  of  oil.  Seventy  thousand 
barrels a day right now, yet the SPR is 90 percent full. 

How  do  the  airlines  look  at  that?  Do  you  think  it  is  as  dumb  as 

I think it is to put that oil underground? 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  I  think  as  companies  and  as  an  industry,  we 
would  support  stopping  filling  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve 
right now. Certainly with the prices at this level and given the de-
mand  out  there,  we  don’t  need  to  be  filling  that  reserve  at  $122  a 
barrel. 

Second,  we  ought  to  look  at  addressing  margin  requirements  for 
people  who  play  in  the  oil  markets,  who  aren’t  there  are  as  real 
consumers of the good, but instead are simply trading it as a paper 
instrument  to  make  a  profit.  Margin  requirements  for  oil  trading 
are 5 percent. Margin requirement for stock trading are around 50. 
Things  like  that  I  think  are  policies  that  we  need  to  look  at  and 
address and deal with that. 

One  of  the  problems  that  we  face  is  that  we  buy  oil  in  dollars. 
The dollar is a very weak currency. Our European competitors pay 
for  oil  in  euros.  So  their  piece  of  paper  is  worth  $1.60,  and  ours  is 
worth  a  dollar.  And  those  kind  of  issues,  I  think,  are  fully  appro-
priate  for  the  Congress  to  address  and  to  take  on.  And  we  would 
support that. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Anderson,  both  of  your  companies  have 
these  travel  planning  systems,  companies  around  the  country.  In 
fact,  I  think  Northwest  has  a  fairly  large  one  in  Minot,  North  Da-
kota. 

Mr. ANDERSON. Yes, it does. Three hundred jobs. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Three  hundred  jobs.  I  kind  of  like  the  prece-

dent that Senator Klobuchar set. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. ANDERSON. I built that one, too. 
Senator DORGAN. You built that one, too. So you will give us the 

same guarantee that—— 

Mr. ANDERSON. Sure.

63 

[Laughter.] 
Senator DORGAN. I think you came to this hearing with one word 
available, ‘‘sure.’’ But let me be serious about the issue of price and 
service. 

Assuming that your companies merge, tell me about the commit-
ment  of  a  much  larger  airline  with  management  perhaps  living  in 
Atlanta,  Georgia,  or  much  of  management  in  Atlanta,  Georgia, 
servicing  the  Northern  Great  Plains  routes  that  I  just  described. 
But  tell  me  about  attention  to  smaller  communities,  smaller  mar-
kets. 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  first,  as  to  that  specific  one,  as  you  know, 
Delta  does  not  fly—this  gets  to  the  point  about  not  being  overlap-
ping. Delta does not fly to North Dakota. 

Senator DORGAN. Well, you did. 
Mr.  ANDERSON.  We  did.  But  it  gives  you  an  idea  about  why  this 
is end-to-end. We didn’t have enough presence in that marketplace 
to be able to sustain one flight a day from Fargo to Salt Lake City. 
But  let  us  talk  about  small  communities,  and  I  think  you  made 
a very good point. Hub and spoke systems are critical to service in 
small  communities.  Low-cost  carriers  and  discount  carriers  do  not 
make  investments  in  small  communities.  They  don’t  buy  the  air-
planes  to  serve  small  communities,  and  that  is  really  left  to  the 
hub and spoke carriers. 

And  the  hub  and  spoke  system  is  particularly  well  adapted  be-
cause we can send one airplane to Fargo and pick up everyone that 
wants  to  go  to  every  other  destination  on  a  network.  So  you  have 
indivisibilities on that same airplane. 

We  have  invested  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  fleets,  if  not 
billions of dollars in fleets, this combination will serve 140 commu-
nities, and a stronger hub and spoke carrier will be better for small 
communities.  And  this  will  be  the  major  airline  that  serves  small 
communities. 

I  would  just  add  that  the  DOT  and  the  Government—it  is  prob-
ably appropriate that Mr. Murphy is here because he was in charge 
of  it  for  quite  a  long  time.  We  should  revamp  the  EAS  program  in 
this  country.  We  should  get  very  serious  about  what  it  is  going  to 
take to run a real Essential Air Service Program, particularly with 
fuel prices at these levels. 

And  I  am  not  talking  about  just  taking  the  current  EAS  for-
mulas.  I  am  talking  about  to  the  point  that  some  have  made  here 
about  how  you  get  an  industry  and  Government  and  all  the  con-
stituents  together  to  figure  out  how  a  real  EAS  program  should 
work. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  time  has  expired.  I  have  to 
go  to  the  floor  on  an  amendment  that  I  have  pending.  So  I  would 
like  to  submit  some  additional  questions  to  the  witnesses.  And  I 
think all of the witnesses have made some really interesting obser-
vations today. I appreciate them being here. 

Thank you. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Dorgan. 
Senator Snowe?

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  am  hearing  mixed  messages  here  today.  I  mean,  there  is  no 
question  that  spiraling  oil  prices  have  put  the  airline  industry  in 
a precarious position. And what I am hearing is that it necessitates 
expanding  the  market  into  the  international  arena  because  you 
can’t compete with low-cost carriers in this country. 

Mr. Neidl, you are saying that there is excess capacity, that seats 
are going to have to come out of the sky. And I read your testimony 
and heard it here today, Mr. Steenland, Mr. Anderson, that smaller 
communities  stand  to  gain  the  most.  You  are  going  to  be,  in  fact, 
doubling the number of small communities served. 

So, which is it in the final analysis? How do we know if the mer-
its  of  this  international  expansion,  it  is  probably  going  to  come  at 
the expense of domestic service and certainly to small communities. 
I  think  we  have  seen  at  the  non-hub  airports,  in  my  state  and 
across this country and the ones to which Senator Dorgan referred 
to in his chart, we are seeing either prices gone up or we have lost 
seats. 

So  if  Mr.  Neidl  is  saying  seats  are  going  to  have  to  come  out  of 
capacity,  and  you  are  suggesting  that  even  in  the  good  times,  as 
I  understand  it  from  your  testimony,  Mr.  Neidl.  Then  here  we  are 
in  this  troubling  period  and  chapter  in  the  history  of  the  aviation 
industry,  and  you  are  somehow  saying  it  is  not  going  to  come  at 
the expense of domestic service. What I am hearing is global, glob-
al, global. 

And  we  don’t  disparage  the  fact  that  you  should  be  involved  in 
the  international  arena,  but  we  heard  that  with  free  trade  agree-
ments,  and  we  have  lost  jobs.  What  I  am  concerned  about  is  the 
lost service that is going to occur here in this country as well. 

So  how  do  we  know  that  what  we  stand  to  gain  or  lose  in  this 
post  merger  period,  since  Mr.  Neidl  is  saying  that  we  are  going  to 
have  to  reduce  excess  capacity?  He  said,  in  fact,  in  reading  your 
testimony,  it  says  besides  greater  market  mass  as  a  result  of  the 
expansion,  the  two  other  benefits  of  consolidation  would  be  cost 
cutting  and  revenue  enhancement.  To  cut  costs,  marginal  oper-
ation,  small  expensive  hub  operations  have  to  be  evaluated  as  to 
their  viability,  which  will  have  an  effect  on  the  communities  they 
currently serve. 

So Mr. Steenland, Mr. Anderson, how do you respond to that? 
Mr.  STEENLAND.  Let  me  take  a  first  shot  at  it,  Senator.  First,  I 
think  we  have  to  do  the  difficult  exercise  of  distinguishing  what 
might  be  created  or  caused  by  the  merger  transaction  and  what 
might be caused by the price of fuel. Because the price of fuel pres-
sures are going to exist whether this transaction occurs or not, and 
the same, the merged entity will be better able to withstand it be-
cause  we  will  be  able  to  drive  some  benefits  that  on  a  stand-alone 
basis we couldn’t reach. 

But  whether  we  have  a  merger  transaction  or  we  don’t,  we  are 
going to be impacted and the industry as a whole is going to be im-
pacted  vis-a`-vis  the  price  of  fuel.  Now  as  to  small  communities, 
Delta and Northwest serve more small communities than any other 
two airlines in the U.S. today. And we have invested, Northwest—

65 

I  will  just  speak  about  Northwest.  We  have  invested  tens  of  mil-
lions of dollars in fleet and infrastructure in order to be able to pro-
vide that service. 

Senator Dorgan, we fly to numerous places in North Dakota. We 
have  five  different  airplane  types  from  34  seats  to  125  seats  that 
basically  provide  service  to  North  Dakota,  and  that  allows  us  to 
provide  a  pattern  and  level  of  service  that  only  a  hub  and  spoke 
carrier  can  provide.  So  we  have  designed  a  network,  and  we  have 
built a structural business that is capable of serving small commu-
nities. 

It  is  not  done  as  a  charitable  act.  It  is  done  as  an  act  that  can 
benefit  a  hub  and  that  where  we  can  provide  service  on  a  profit-
able,  sustainable  basis.  We  have  done  it  in  the  past,  and  by  con-
summating  this  transaction,  we  will  be  better  able  to  continue  in 
the future. 

Senator SNOWE. Mr. Anderson? 
Mr.  ANDERSON.  I  will  speak  to  the  point  you  made  about  inter-
national,  and  this  really  proves  up  the  point  Doug  made  about 
small  community  service.  We  did  a  look  at  Bangor  to  JFK,  and  a 
quarter of all the passengers that we carry from Bangor to JFK are 
international passengers. 

And  in  fact,  if  we  look  at  our  passenger  loads  at  JFK,  where  we 
operate  a  large  gateway  to  many  destinations  in  Europe,  Africa, 
and the Middle East, 25 percent of the passengers that we connect 
through  JFK  come  from  small  communities.  The  opportunity  that 
we  have  ahead  of  us  together  is  to  continue  to  expand  in  a  global 
environment,  where  business  is  being  conducted  all  around  the 
world, where our large customer, our largest customer is Procter & 
Gamble. Northwest’s largest customer is probably—— 

Mr. STEENLAND. General Motors. 
Mr.  ANDERSON.  General  Motors.  And  those  companies  and  com-
panies  like  them—Coca-Cola,  IBM—those  companies  are  con-
ducting  business  all  around  the  world.  And  we  want  to  be  posi-
tioned  where  we  can  provide  to  them  a  single  network  whether  it 
is a large community or a small community. So the opportunity we 
have  ahead  of  us  is  to  be  able  to  expand  internationally  to  really 
compete for the business traveler. 

Senator  SNOWE.  But  you  can’t  dismiss  the  value  and  the  impor-
tance  of  domestic  service  and  smaller  communities.  Because  albeit 
there are people leaving from Bangor and going to JFK to go inter-
nationally,  they  still  depend  mightily  on  the  service  that  your  two 
carriers  provide  to  that  small  community  because  low-cost  carriers 
will  not  go  to  Bangor.  You  know,  they  are  point-to-point.  They  go 
to  one  community  in  Maine,  and  they  don’t  serve  anything  beyond 
that, and that is going to be the problem. 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  I  mean,  if  you  look  at  the  history  of  these 
two  airlines,  these  two  airlines  have  had  long  and  deep  histories 
serving small communities around the United States, and we have 
made  significant  investments  in  long-term  gate  leases,  in  aircraft 
leases,  and  in  hub  facilities  to  be  able  to  support  small  commu-
nities.  We  rely—our  business  model  for  decades  has  relied  very 
heavily on collecting traffic from small communities. 

And  that  is  why  the  hub  system  works  because  when  you  send 
an  airplane  to  Bangor  into  your  hub,  you  can  carry  everyone  in 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

66 

Bangor  without  five  different  airplanes.  You  can  put  everyone  on 
one,  and  that  indivisibility  gives  you  an  economic  model  that 
works. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  hope  that  continues  to  be  sustained—— 
Mr. ANDERSON. I do, too. 
Senator  SNOWE.—if  the  merger  is  completed  because  that  is 
going  to  be  ultimately  the  issue.  We  have  heard  that,  and  I  cer-
tainly agree with Ms. Friend with respect to the fact that we have 
not  had  a  rational  aviation  policy  since  deregulation.  We  have  all 
experienced  it  since  deregulation  the  last  30  years  on  a  weekly 
basis,  and  I  understand  the  struggles  within  the  industry.  But 
clearly, there remain to be challenges. 

And I agree with the Chairman. We need to have an overarching 
plan  because  it  is  in  our  security  interest  in  this  country,  frankly, 
from  a  number  of  standpoints  and  perspectives.  And  I  think  that 
that needs to happen rather than just predicated on conjecture and 
speculation about what the future will look like. 

So I thank all of you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Cantwell? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And thank you for holding this hearing. I am sorry I had to step 
out  for  a  few  minutes,  but  I  did  hear  most  of  the  testimony  and 
I  want  to  say  that  I  am  very  sympathetic  to  the  points  that  Ms. 
Friend and Mr. Roach made. It is very frustrating that during this 
time  period  that  people  really  have  lost  their  jobs  and  really  have 
lost their pensions. 

And  I  am  not  sure  that  the  Federal  Pension  Board  has  done  its 
job, oftentimes drawing this into bankruptcy and allowing the indi-
viduals  to  basically  be  parceled  out  on  pensions  and  things  of  that 
nature in bankruptcy proceedings. 

But  I  am  concerned  in  the  sense  that  when  I  look  at  this  issue 
that fuel costs have got to have played a very large role in the chal-
lenges  that  we  are  seeing  in  aviation  today.  It  is  amazing  to  me 
that  anybody  is  still  in  business  at  the  level  of  fuel  price  spikes 
that we have seen. And we are not exactly seeing any relief today. 
I  hope  that  this  Committee  will  have  oversight  hearings  on  the 
FTC’s  new  responsibility  in  reining  in  market  manipulation  and 
making sure that we do police oil markets effectively. 

But  I  was  wondering,  Mr.  Anderson  or  Mr.  Steenland,  if  any  of 
you  have  comments  about  how  you  look  at  oil  prices  moving  for-
ward,  and  what  do  we  do  about  it  in  protecting  all  of  us?  Because 
it  really  does  impact  everybody,  it  impacts  people’s  jobs  and  liveli-
hood. 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  I  will  go  out  a  little  bit  on  a  limb  here.  I 
mean,  we  have  had  not  an  energy  policy  in  this  company—in  this 
country.  Well,  we  have  one  in  the  company.  Particularly,  it  is  pay 
the fuel bill. But in this country, we have not had an energy policy 
over  the  last  8  years,  and  that  is  a  real  problem  not  just  for  this 
industry, but for all industries. 

And it seems to me that when you think about what is the most 
important thing that Congress can do or that our Government can 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

67 

do  for  this  industry  and  all  industries  is  to  get  our  arms  around 
what the energy policy needs to be. 

There are things in the short run that we can do. Stop filling the 
Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve.  Take  steps  to  be  certain  that  paper 
trading  in  oil  commodities  is  stopped  because  a  lot  of  the  people 
that  buy  and  sell  oil  never  use  the  oil.  It  is—the  futures  market 
doesn’t require much in the way of margin accounts. 

But further than that, we have to have conservation. We have to 
have alternative sources. I can tell you that the airline industry in 
the  past  20  years  has  had  over  100  percent  efficiency  because  of 
the  good  work  at  Boeing,  General  Electric,  and  Pratt  in  terms  of 
the  advances  in  technology.  But  our  advances  in  technology  and 
our investments in new technology is not keeping up. 

You know, a dollar a barrel of oil is $80 million a year. So when 
it  moves  $5  in  a  day,  on  an  annual  basis,  Delta  just  spent  $400 
million  more.  And  we  can’t  build  engines  more  efficiently  fast 
enough to keep up with the fact that we do not have a national en-
ergy policy. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you.  I  understand,  Mr.  Steenland,  I 
might  have  been  out  of  the  hearing  when  you  said  about  margin 
rates as well. 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  Right.  I  think  that  is  clearly  worth  looking  at. 
And  I  would  completely  concur  with  what  you  have  said.  I  don’t 
think we can underestimate the incredible impact that this radical 
spike in oil prices is driving. 

If  you  just  look  at  last  year,  Northwest  made  over  $750  million, 
and  we  were  able  to  pay  to  our  employees  $125  million  in  profit 
sharing  and  other  incentives.  In  the  first  quarter  of  this  year,  we 
lost  $191  million  versus  earning  $73  million  in  the  first  quarter  of 
the  prior  year.  And  our  fuel  bill  for  flying  the  exact  same  size  air-
line was $450 million higher, and that is going to continue through 
the  rest  of  this  year.  And  unabated,  these  kinds  of  increased  oil 
prices are going to have a significant impact on not just the airline 
industry, but on other industries and on society as a whole. 

Senator CANTWELL. And as an industry that I would assume be-
cause you are very big and intense users, what is it, second highest 
cost of your expenses, I would—— 

Mr. STEENLAND. Highest. Forty percent of every dollar we collect 

goes to the crude—goes to our jet fuel prices. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So  do  you  think  this  is  a  rational  market 

that we are seeing? 

Mr. STEENLAND. No. No. 
Senator CANTWELL. Mr. Anderson? 
Mr. ANDERSON. No. It is not a rational market. Rational markets 

don’t move this way. 

Mr. COOPER. Senator, could I offer one other suggestion? I think 
the margin requirements. We have to scare some money out of this 
market.  It  has  just  been  outrageous.  The  other  one  is  closing  the 
Enron loophole. If you go back and look, Congress allowed oil to be 
less regulated than onions. And—— 

Senator CANTWELL. I like to say hamburger, but you know what? 

Onions work as well. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

68 

Mr. COOPER. Onions are neat because they are a perishable com-
modity,  and  we  actually  have  a  lot  of  regulation  of  onions  because 
it is easy to manipulate a market when they go bad fast. 

Since  that  decision  was  made  in  2002,  there  has  been  an  expo-
nential  increase  in  the  number  of  contracts  and  value  traded  in 
that  market.  In  2006,  the  Senate  Committee  on  Oversight  and  In-
vestigations  concluded  that  one  third  of  the  price  of  oil  was  due  to 
speculation. At today’s prices, that is $30 a barrel or more. 

And so, the Congress has voted once to close the Enron loophole. 
The  President  vetoed  it  in  the  ag  bill.  I  understand  it  is  back  in 
the bill. And with all the talk about how we want to lower the price 
of gasoline—I just came from a House hearing on gasoline—that is 
the single-most important thing you can do. Because if you require 
people  to  identify  who  they  are  and  how  much  they  are  trading, 
they will run from this market, and that will be a good thing. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, I thank you for that answer. 
And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  don’t  know  how  this  is  all  going  to  work 
out here. But I definitely think that this issue and the passion that 
the  witnesses  just  showed  as  it  relates  to  this  and  the  numbers 
that  they  revealed  show  that  we  have  to  pay  much  more  attention 
to policing of these markets. 

So I thank the Chair. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
I  have  some  questions,  but  I  am  anxious  to  have  Senator 

Klobuchar go ahead. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I  am  sure  you  are.  I  just  wanted  to  follow 
up on Senator Cantwell’s questions and just say that we introduced 
today—Senator  Cantwell  was  involved,  I  was  involved—the  Con-
sumer  First  Energy  Act.  And  I  think  one  of  the  things  that  would 
be  very  helpful  for  us  is  if  we  got  some  business  support  for  these 
types of efforts. 

We  have  a  lot  of  consumer  support,  but  it  basically  rolls  back 
some  of  the  tax  breaks  for  the  oil  companies,  puts  them  into  the 
development  of  renewable  energy,  asks  big  oil  to  pay  their  fair 
share through a windfall profit tax, halts the Government purchase 
of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that you mentioned, pro-
tects  consumers  from  price  gouging,  and  does  work  on  the  market 
speculation  that  we  were  talking  about,  closes  the  Enron  loophole 
that  is  actually  in  the  farm  bill,  and  then  standing  up  to  OPEC. 
We  would  really  like  to  push  the  administration  to  push  OPEC 
since  we  have  business  dealings  with  some  of  their  countries,  that 
they not keep their production artificially low. 

And I am not going to spend my time right now asking questions 
on  your  views  of  every  one  of  those.  But  I  do  ask  you  to  look  at 
those  because  it  is  very  difficult  for  us  to  be  on  our  own  when  we 
need the help of business, but you have just described it is 40 per-
cent of your costs. 

The  questions  I  want  to  ask,  first  of  all,  some  of  the  employee 
issues,  and  specifically  first  the  pilot  issues.  And  I  understand  the 
carriers have only reached a contract with the Delta pilots and not 
the  Northwest  pilots.  Don’t  you  need  a  joint  contract  with  both 
Northwest  and  Delta  pilots  before  you  close  on  the  merger  to  get 
the synergies that you have talked about in this deal?

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  first,  what  we  tried  to  do  had  never  been 
tried before in this industry. Typically, what has happened in every 
other  consolidation  during  regulation  or  deregulation  is  the  deal 
gets announced, and then after it closes, the parties begin a process 
under  the  ALPA  merger  policy  of  beginning  to  combine  the  collec-
tive bargaining agreements. 

So what we wanted to do was bring the two together in advance. 
We made good progress. We didn’t get it done. We are still hopeful 
that we are going to be able to get it done. And in fact, I think we 
have  had  a  very  conciliatory  statement  issued  by  both  Captain 
Moak and Captain Stevens, who runs the ALPA unit at Northwest. 
In terms of the synergies we can capture with the collective bar-
gaining  agreement  amendments  that  we  entered  into  with  the 
Delta  pilots  and  the  existing  collective  bargaining  agreement  with 
the  Northwest  pilots  that  was  negotiated  during  the  bankruptcy, 
we  can  capture  a  significant  portion  of  the  synergies  on  day  one. 
And that is the result of the fact that this is a little bit different 
merger.  Northwest  and  Delta  have  had  a  domestic  alliance  ar-
rangement  for  5  years.  And  in  the  course  of  that  and  getting  ap-
proval  from  the  Department  of  Transportation  for  that  back  in 
2003,  our  computer  systems,  our  yield  management,  scheduling, 
pricing,  we  sell  each  other’s  products  and  manage  each  other’s  in-
ventory  and  code  share  today.  And  we  have  a  joint  frequent  flyer 
program, joint club problem. 

So we have the ability under the two collective bargaining agree-
ments  to  do  system  code  share,  day  one,  and  will  jointly  manage 
the  product  or  manage  the  product  and  manage  the  yield  manage-
ment  systems  so  we  can  capture  a  significant  amount  of  the 
synergies from day one. 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  I  think  it  would  be  fair  to  say  that  the  goal 
clearly  remains  to  look  to  attain  a  single  collective  bargaining 
agreement with the pilot groups prior to the closing, and there will 
be meetings set up and discussions to look to attain that result. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. I am just concerned based on what we have 
seen  with  other  mergers  when  we  didn’t  have  that  kind  of  agree-
ment and didn’t seem to result in good things. 

The  other  question  I  had  was  at  the  Judiciary  Committee  hear-
ing,  Mr.  Anderson,  you  said  that  the  combined  carrier  has  ‘‘made 
a  commitment  to  the  frontline  employees  that  there  would  be  no 
furloughs as a result of the transaction.’’ Do you still stand by that 
commitment and for how long? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Yes.  Well,  indefinite.  But  go  back  to  what  Doug 
had said, I mean, and even what Mr. Roach had said. If fuel is at— 
and it is this difficulty in sort of divining between this transaction 
and  what  happens  if  oil  prices  do  go  to  the  level  that  the  CEO  of 
Exxon  and  the  head  of  Goldman  Sachs  say.  That  will  be  an  inde-
pendent effect. 

But as a result of this merger, where we sit today, both of these 
airlines are very lean in terms of having gone through bankruptcy. 
And  we  are  really  confident  that  because  they  are  end-to-end,  we 
won’t be faced with that prospect. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  I  understand  that  both  Delta  and 
Northwest have employees on involuntary furlough. Delta is having

70 

something  like  800,  and  Northwest  has  500.  What  will  happen  to 
these employees as a result of the merger? 

Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  we  obviously  want—I  don’t  know  the  spe-
cifics of the Northwest. I can tell you about the Delta situation are 
principally  we  have  recalled  all  the  flight  attendants,  we  have  re-
called  all  the  pilots,  and  those  are  principally  mechanics.  And  we 
are going through an early out program right now and an early re-
tirement program that our employees have asked us for repeatedly. 
Well,  we  put  one  in  place,  and  we  are  hopeful  that  it  is  going  to 
give  us  the  opportunity  to  get  the  furloughed  mechanics  back  on 
quickly as we build our maintenance business. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  then  to  follow  up  on  some  of  Senator 
Dorgan’s questions. Back in January, I sent a letter, you sent a re-
sponse  back,  about  the  service  to  some  of  the  rural  areas.  And  in 
that letter, you wrote to me that the merger between your two car-
riers  ‘‘would  deliver  significant  benefit  to  consumers  by,  among 
other  things,  increasing  service  to  smaller,  more  thinly  traveled 
routes.’’ 

Could you describe what you mean by that commitment? 
Mr.  ANDERSON.  Well,  I  think  it  is  just  generally  the  point  that 
a  stronger  hub  and  spoke  carrier  that  would  emanate  from  this 
combination  would  allow  us  to  go  into  cities  where—take,  for  in-
stance, Fargo. And we don’t have antitrust—or we are not a single 
entity.  So  we  haven’t—we  have  got  to  operate  separately  and  still 
compete. 

But  the  kinds  of  things  you  think  about  are  we  had  one  flight 
a  day,  Fargo-Salt  Lake  City.  We  just  didn’t  have—Great  Plains 
Software  in  Fargo  was  not  going  to  sign  a  corporate  agreement 
with  Delta  because  we  only  had  one  flight  a  day,  whereas  North-
west  has  been  in  Fargo  since  the  1930s.  And  when  you  take  that 
network  and  combine  it  with  the  Delta  network,  now  we  have  the 
opportunity  to  go  into  cities  that  either  of  us  maybe  served  alone, 
but  because  we  have  enough  presence,  we  will  be  able  to  connect 
that city to another hub. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  You  know,  there  is  about  140  combined 

communities that you both serve, smaller communities? 

Mr. ANDERSON. Yes. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  I  guess  Minnesota—we  have  our  pic-
ture  here  of  our  state  with  the  service  to  the  communities.  Sioux 
Falls,  South  Dakota,  right  across  the  border.  Fargo,  as  you  men-
tioned.  Grand  Forks,  Thief  River  Falls,  Bemidji,  International 
Falls,  Chisholm  and  Hibbing,  Duluth,  Brainerd,  St.  Cloud,  Roch-
ester.

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Do  you  envision  that  the  service  to  those 

areas is going to change as a result of the merger? 

Mr. STEENLAND. No. And we have provided service to those com-
munities  for  a  long  time.  Several  of  them  are  EAS  communities, 
and  I  think  we  have  said  that  is  another  program  that  probably, 
for  the  Congress,  is  worth  looking  at  because  when  you  sign  EAS, 
make  EAS  commitments,  you  make  them  for  2  years.  And  when 
you  think  about  what  has  impact—what  has  changed  in  the  world 
of  fuel  prices  during  that  2-year  period,  that  clearly  has  some  im-
pact on willingness to make that commitment. 

But  having  said  that,  we  are—have  no  intention  to  eliminate 
service to any of those cities. And what the evidence shows is that

when  you  are  able  to  offer  service  on  the  same  airline  with  the 
same  brand,  the  same  policies,  the  same  frequent  flyer  program 
and  the  like,  that  provides  more  incentives  for  customers  to  fly  on 
that airline. 

So  somebody  coming  out  of  International  Falls  or  Thief  River 
Falls or Bemidji or Duluth, when they are looking at flying on the 
post  merger  airline,  there  is  going  to  be  a  lot  more  destinations 
that  they  are  going  to  be  able  to  get  to  that  will  be  online  single 
carrier points than what they previously could do just out of North-
west. 

And that is going to make flying over the Minneapolis hub more 
attractive, and we think it will allow us to be better able to justify 
and  to  continue  the  level  of  service  that  we  provide  to  those  small 
communities. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank 
you for holding the hearing. I think this is an important discussion 
to  have  not  only  with  respect  to  the  merger  in  front  of  us,  which 
is  awfully  important  to  those  of  us  who  represent  States  that  are 
going  to  be  most  impacted  by  this,  but  I  think  generally  speaking 
as  well  the  entire  aviation  industry.  I  expect  we  are  going  to  see 
a lot more of this. 

And something has to give, and I can understand why Northwest 
and  Delta,  from  an  economic  standpoint,  want  to  do  this.  It,  in 
many respects, becomes a matter of survival in the airline business 
today. 

But  there  are  many  of  us  who  are  very  concerned  about  the  fu-
ture of the industry, the impacts of this merger and potential merg-
ers  that  we  might  be  reviewing  in  the  future.  But  I  guess  I  would 
just  like  to  follow  up  on  a  couple  of  the  questions  that  have  per-
haps  already  been  asked  and  get  at  the—some  of  the  service  and 
cost issues, particularly with regard to smaller communities in the 
network. 

But  the  first  question  I  wanted  to  ask  has  to  do,  though,  with— 
my  understanding  is  that  the  rationale  for  the  combined  airline  is 
about a billion dollars in savings, and the losses in the first quarter 
were  like  $10  billion.  It  seems  to  me  like  if  you  are  going  to  save 
a  billion  dollars  and  you  are  losing  $10  billion  in  a  quarter,  that 
the  economics  of  that  in  the  long  run  are  going  to  be  awfully  dif-
ficult to make work. 

So I understand why you are doing it. I understand that the ne-
cessity of trying to find some synergies and the end-to-end concept 
and that many of your routes don’t overlap, but expand you—create 
expansion  opportunities  into  other  areas.  But  could  you  just  kind 
of  elaborate  a  little  bit  on  how  these  savings  in  the  long  run  are 
going  to  be  useful  in  terms  of  the  viability  of  the  company  when 
you have got those types of—declaring those types of losses?

73 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  Well,  first,  as  to  the  first  quarter  losses,  the 
real,  true  economic  loss  that  Northwest  experienced  was  $191  mil-
lion, and Delta, I believe, was about $275 million. 

Our  accountants  required  us  to  basically  write  down  the  net 
worth  that  was  on  our  balance  sheet  because  of,  in  part,  what  oil 
was  doing,  and  so  we  both  took  very  large  noncash  accounting 
write-offs  that  helped  produce  that  very  large  number.  So  they 
were legitimate write-offs from a GAAP accounting perspective, but 
they  weren’t  real  economic  losses  to  reflect  how  the  business  was 
otherwise performing. 

Now, obviously, the bottom line results are going to be impacted 
by  the  price  of  oil.  From  our  perspective,  these  benefits,  which  we 
think  are  conservative  at  a  little  bit  north  of  $1  billion,  are  going 
to  be  there  whether  the  price  of  oil  is  $100,  whether  the  price  of 
oil  is  $110,  $120.  So  the  merged  carrier  will  always  be  better  off 
in terms of being economically more viable. 

But  obviously,  as  the  price  of  oil,  if  it  continues  to  increase,  the 
economic  challenges  that  the  merged  carrier  will  face  will  be  in-
creasingly difficult, although it will always be at least a billion dol-
lars better off because of this transaction. 

Senator THUNE. And maybe you answered this question already. 
But  did  that  billion  dollars  in  savings  assume  an  agreement  with 
the pilots? Did that billion, that is assuming that, OK, which hasn’t 
been reached yet. 

If,  in  fact,  gas  prices,  fuel  prices  continue  to  do  what  they  are 
doing today—and I think, Mr. Anderson, you have mentioned some-
body  that  had  projected  $200  a  barrel  at  some  point?  I  mean,  I 
don’t  know  how  any  airline  is  going  to  be  able  to  survive  under 
those economic circumstances. 

But  let  us  just  say,  for  example,  that  fuel  costs  continue  to  go 
up.  How  would  service  to  rural  states  like  South  Dakota  be  im-
pacted?  And  do  you  see  reductions  occurring  on  those  routes  to 
areas  like  the  ones  that  were  on  the  map  that  Senator  Klobuchar 
put up just now? 

Some  of  those  cities  are—in  my  state  are  EAS  cities,  but  there 
are some that aren’t. And already, we are seeing I don’t think there 
has  been  a  lot  in  terms  of  announcements  with  regard  to  summer 
service.  I  think  there  is  an  aircraft  change  going  into  Rapid  City 
this  summer.  But  clearly,  one  of  the  main  concerns  of  those  of  us 
who represent that part of the country have is in a post merger air-
line, what the service is going to be like? Are we going to continue 
to have frequency of flights? 

And  then,  second  follow  up  to  that  is  what  about  affordability 
and cost? Are you going to see the types of cost and prices that we 
are  seeing  in  some  of  our  communities  today  continue  to  go  up, 
fares? 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  Well,  I  think,  Senator,  the—we  are  in  a  reality 
where  we  both  have  restructured.  We  have  committed  we  are  not 
going  to  go  back  to  our  employees.  We  are  going  to  continue  to 
meet our pension obligations. Our aircraft cost have basically been 
marked-to-market so there is no more savings to be had there. 

We  have  gone  after  our  vendors  with  a  passion  to  try  to  be  sure 
we  get  the  best  prices  from  them.  And  as  our  fuel  costs  go  up,  we 
really  have  no  choice  but  to  pass  them  on.  And  as  they  get  passed 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

74 

on  and  fares  increase,  simple  economics  would  say  that  there  will 
be fewer passengers that travel at higher prices. 

Now one of the things—the benefits and one of the ways that we 
can address that is that we serve rural communities with multiple 
aircraft  types.  So  if  you  just  think  about  what  we  do  in  South  Da-
kota, we operate several airplanes that seat 150 passengers. We op-
erate  several  Saab  propeller  airplanes  that  seat  34  passengers.  So 
maybe in a higher fuel price world, the 150-passenger airplane be-
comes a 125-passenger airplane or maybe becomes a 100-passenger 
airplane. 

And  we  adjust  for  that  decrease  in  demand  that  higher  prices 
drive  by  taking  the  investments  that  we  have  made  in  having  a 
varied  fleet  and  being  able  to  preserve  the  service,  but  perhaps 
with fewer seats. And we also want to try to preserve frequency be-
cause the South Dakota flights come into Minneapolis. We operate 
multiple  banks  during  the  day,  and  it  is  in  our  interest  as  well  as 
your  constituents  and  our  customer  interests  to  try  to  provide  as 
many  multiple  times  of  day  when  they  can  depart  Aberdeen  or 
Rapid City or Sioux Falls. 

Today  at  Sioux  Falls,  we  fly  seven  times  a  day  to  Minneapolis. 
And that helps our hub. It also helps the people destined for Sioux 
Falls. And to the extent that we can, maybe seven becomes six. Or 
maybe, as I said, the airplane size becomes a little smaller. I think 
that is how we adjust for this potential new world. 

Senator  THUNE.  I  think  I  have  asked  this  question  of  you  pre-
viously.  But  from  an  operational  standpoint,  I  have  been  told  that 
it  was  more  costly  to  operate  RJs  because  you  had  fewer  seats  to 
help  pay  for  the  cost  of  the  fuel  increase.  And  you  had  indicated 
that  is  not  necessarily  an  issue.  Because  a  lot  of  the  premise  for 
service  into  smaller  communities  is  smaller  planes,  fewer  seats, 
higher  loads.  But  that  some  of  those  types  of  flights  might  be  in 
jeopardy  because  of  higher  fuel  costs—from  an  operations  stand-
point, an RJ relative to one of your more standard widebody. 

Mr.  STEENLAND.  Sure.  On  a  seat  basis,  the  larger  airplane  is 
going  to  be  more  efficient  to  operate.  But  if  you  think  about  com-
paring  the  50-seat  CRJ  with  the  100-seat  DC–9,  if  you  were  going 
to  operate  the  50-seat  CRJ,  you  would  end  up  putting  on  that  air-
plane  your  50  highest-paying  passengers.  And  so,  in  essence,  your 
unit revenues that you would collect on that flight would be higher 
as  well  compared  to  what  you  would  collect  on  the  bigger  airplane 
because you would have a bigger dispersion of what fares would be. 
Senator  THUNE.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  industry  is  a  lot  like 
we  have  described  agriculture  in  past  years.  We  have  had  some 
commodity  price  improvement  here  in  the  last  year  or  so,  but  for 
a lot of years, farmers would lose a little bit on each sale and make 
up for it in volume. And it seems to me that is kind of what maybe 
characterizes or describes the airline industry today. 

And  if  we  see  these  continued  increases  in  fuel  costs,  I  don’t 
know  where  this  is  headed.  But  it  seems  to  me  we  are  going  to 
have to take a very hard look at where the industry is headed. And 
these  types  of—I  think  we  are  going  to  see  a  lot  more  of  this  in 
the  future,  and  like  I  said,  from  an  economic  standpoint,  I  don’t 
fault you at all for trying to figure out how you survive in an envi-
ronment that is going to be very difficult.

But  I  thank  you  for  your  answers  to  the  questions  and  look  for-
ward  to  continuing  the  dialogue  as  the  process  moves  forward. 
Thank you all. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Thune. 
I  am  going  to  have  to  close  this  now,  much  to  my  regret,  due  to 
a specific timing of a phone call that I have to make to the Director 
of National Intelligence. He is waiting on a phone call. 

But let me close with these thoughts. When you have hearings— 
this  has  been  very  interesting  to  me.  People  say  if  they  are  in  an 
operational  situation  what  their  problems  are.  People  say  if  they 
are in a worker situation what their problems are. And often some 
of  it  is  said  with  a  particular  passion  because,  after  all,  they  are 
there at the witness table, and it needs to be said. 

I  also  have  a  feeling  that  just  looking  at  all  of  you,  that  the 
stakes  are  so  enormous  for  each  one  of  you  to  make  all  of  this 
work. And we have failed in the Congress, for reasons which I will 
not  go  into,  to  pass  a  Federal  aviation  bill  in  this  past  week.  We 
have moved to reconsider so that we can still do work in the future, 
and I believe that we will. 

The interplay of personalities works in the Senate just as it does 
anywhere  else.  But  I  come  out  of  this  hearing,  frankly,  somewhat 
optimistic  simply  because  the  whole  concept  of  the  United  States 
of  America  without  a  viable  aviation  industry  is  not  only  repug-
nant, but it sort of defines national security and the ability for peo-
ple to move from here to there and to do business. 

I understand companies go overseas and they can do better over 
there.  I  am  not  against  the  merger.  I  want  very,  very  strong  scru-
tiny  of  it  by  the  Department  of  Justice  and  others  and  with  great 
detail.  But  I  am  not  convinced  that  anybody  here  is  operating  out 
of  ill  faith.  I  think  people  are  angry  or  frustrated  simply  because 
of, one, the times, the price of oil, the unpredictability. 

Senator  Klobuchar  had  this  whole  series  of  commitments,  and  I 
admire you enormously, Mr. Anderson, for accepting most of them. 
But  I  don’t  think  that  morally  or  in  the  real  world  that  you  know 
what  is  going  to  happen  2  years  from  now,  or  Mr.  Steenland,  or 
Ms. Friend, or Mr. Cooper, Mr. Roach. None of us know. 

The  trends  are  all  strictly  downhill  now,  and  there  is  nothing 
that is particularly hopeful at the present time. So I think we need 
each  other  a  lot  more  than  we  are  willing  to  admit  and  that  it  is 
good  to  get  emotions  out  and  to  get  plans  out  and  to  get  analysis 
out. But at the end of the day, we are going to have to fix this sys-
tem. 

And I have said that I am not against re-regulation. I don’t think 
I want to go back to that day. But if I get desperate enough, count 
on  me  to  be  that  kind  of  a  vote  because  I  represent  a  rural  con-
stituency  with  no  possible  way  of  developing  its  potential  without 
the  essential  Air  Service  Program,  the  Airport  Improvement  Pro-
gram and the hub and spoke system working. 

We  have  had  to  make  substantial  adjustments  since  U.S.  Air 
moved  out  of  Pittsburgh  and  with  United  to  go  to  Dulles.  And  it 
is  working,  but  we  are  always  holding  on  by  our  fingertips.  And 
you  know  that.  You  all  know  that.  And  you  are  all  holding  on  by

your fingertips. I mean, not to be schmaltzy, but we are all in this 
together. 

And  so,  rather  than  say  that  this  has  been  an  unuseful  session, 
I think it has been very useful. I think there have been people who 
have  been  absolutely  candid.  You  have  been  very  forthcoming.  Mr. 
Anderson, I have never heard such a commitment in my entire life 
from any corporate executive. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. And I think that is wonderful, and I hope 
that  it  all  works  out.  But  everything  is  changing  all  the  time.  The 
war  on  terror  has  not  finished  its  business  in  this  country  or  else-
where,  and  it  will  continue  to  change  the  way  we  have  to  do  our 
aviation system. 

I had an all labor group come in to see me a couple of weeks ago 
and  say  let  us  get  that  FAA  bill  passed,  and  we  did  try.  And  I 
would  be  delighted  to  talk  with  you  why  it  didn’t  work.  But  it  is 
not over yet. It is not over yet. 

One thing around here, and I will just say this for the record and 
then  I  will  stop.  I  am  not  an  enormous  fan  of  railroads.  When  I 
came  here,  there  were  50  Class  A  railroads,  24  years  ago,  there 
were 50 Class A railroads. And they all competed with each other, 
and  then  the  Staggers  Act  passed.  And  the  Staggers  Act  made  a 
very simple declaration. 

It  said  that  80  percent  of  wherever  there  are  two  railroads  com-
peting for a market, and this takes place over the entire country— 
that  means  it  is  all  50  states—then  the  market  will  set  the  price. 
Where  there  is  only  one  railroad  operating,  then  the  railroad  will 
not the set the price, but the Surface Transportation Board will set 
the price. 

Now  that  has  been  conveniently  forgotten  by  every  single  chair-
man  of  the  Commerce  Committee  over  the  past  20  years.  So  the 
law  has  been  broken  consistently.  The  American  Railroad  Associa-
tion stays under the radar. So nobody ever says that much or they 
would  make  special  arrangements  with  people  to  keep  them  calm. 
But it is no way to run a transportation system. 

I  am  thrilled  to  chair  the  aviation  system.  I  admire  its  chal-
lenges.  I  admire  the  way  all  of  its  people  are  trying  to  cope  with 
the  difficulties  that  emerge  out  of  this,  and  I  simply  pledge  to  you 
that  this,  from  my  point  of  view,  will  be  the  first  of  a  very  serious 
effort  to  try  and  get  an  aviation  system  that  works.  Not  just 
through  congressional  legislation,  but,  in  fact,  in  the  practice  of  it. 
Easily said, hard to do, but time to start. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Mr. Chairman, could I say one more thing? 
I just want to make one point as part of this. I am glad that they 
were willing to commit in current situations to this, but remember 
there  were  promises  that  was  made  to  our  state  in  exchange  for 
our  state  giving  the  money,  basically,  so  that  they  wouldn’t  go  fi-
nancially  under.  And  so,  there  was  more  than  just  asking  these 
questions  in  the  course  of  a  hearing  and  trying  to  get  commit-
ments. There were actual promises made to the state of Minnesota 
at  a  time  when  the  airlines  were  having  financial  problems,  and 
there  is  actual  fiscal  penalties  that  attach  if  those  promises  aren’t 
met.

So  I  wanted  to  clarify  that  for  the  record  and  also  that  I  would 
be submitting some questions in writing about what I was thinking 
at  the  end  here,  as  the  commitments  are  triggered  by  if  the  price 
of  oil  goes  up  more,  maybe  we  won’t  have  the  commitment  for  the 
employees.  But  perhaps  there  could  be  some  way  to  estimate  at 
what  point  those  commitments  would  change,  given  where  the 
price of oil could be? 

And  I  can  do  that  in  writing  since  I  know  that  you  have  to  go 

to something else. But I wanted to thank the witnesses today. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. This hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 4:35 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Chairman  Rockefeller,  thank  you  for  scheduling  our  hearing  today  on  the  finan-
cial  state  of  the  airline  industry.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  our  witnesses  for  their 
participation. 

In the past 10 years, this Committee has witnessed dramatic ‘‘ups and downs’’ in 
the  airline  industry.  For  a  state  like  Alaska,  which  depends  on  aviation  more  than 
any  other  mode  of  transportation,  the  seemingly  constant  state  of  turmoil  and  un-
certainty is very concerning. 

Over  the  last  week  and  a  half  Congress  has  debated  the  need  to  modernize  the 
Nation’s  aviation  infrastructure.  This  modernization  has  important  implications  for 
both  our  busiest  cities  and  rural  areas,  like  Alaska.  Unfortunately,  other  issues 
made  this  impossible.  I  hope  that  Congress  will  continue  to  work  to  modernize  our 
aviation infrastructure. 

Today,  we  turn  to  the  financial  state  of  the  airlines.  On  Monday  of  this  week, 
crude oil rose to over $120 a barrel. Already, many of the airlines and their employ-
ees  have  gone  through  difficult  bankruptcy  proceedings  and  restructuring.  If  the 
price  of  oil  continues  to  increase,  or  even  remains  stagnant  at  over  $100  a  barrel, 
sustainability  of  U.S.  air  carriers  is  going  to  be  significantly  impacted  and  we  may 
see consolidation through elimination instead of mergers. 

Obviously, one solution to the crude oil problem is increased domestic production, 

but that is an issue for another hearing. 

Thank you Chairman Rockefeller, I look forward to the testimony. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN LEE MOAK, CHAIRMAN, DELTA AIR LINES MASTER 

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL, AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL 

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison,  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank 
you  for  providing  me  the  opportunity  to  submit  testimony  for  today’s  ‘‘Hearing  on 
The  State  of  the  Airline  Industry  and  the  Potential  Impact  of  a  Delta/Northwest 
Merger.’’ 

My  name  is  Lee  Moak,  and  I  am  a  Captain  with  Delta  Air  Lines.  I  am  also  the 
Chairman  of  the  Delta  Master  Executive  Council  of  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Association 
(ALPA), the union that represents over 7,300 pilots of Delta Air Lines. I have flown 
for  Delta  for  over  20  years.  Prior  to  my  career  at  Delta,  I  served  this  Nation  as  a 
United  States  Marine  Corps  fighter  pilot,  and  as  I  joined  Delta,  I  transitioned  to 
the  Naval  Air  Reserve  Force  to  finish  my  military  career  as  a  U.S.  Navy  fighter 
pilot. 

I mention my military credentials because as I continue, I want to emphasize that 
I  am  proud  of  my  service  in  defense  of  our  American  way  of  life,  including  a  free 
market economy. 

Our  Nation’s  aviation  industry  is  unique,  and  careful  government  scrutiny  and 
oversight must ensure that any potential industry consolidation is in the best inter-
ests  of  the  traveling  public.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  I  welcome  the  opportunity  to 
testify  in  support  of  the  proposed  merger  between  Delta  Air  Lines  and  Northwest 
Airlines. 

Fifteen months ago, I submitted written testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee 
on  Commerce,  Science  and  Transportation.  The  Committee  was  holding  a  hearing 
entitled ‘‘State of the Airline Industry: The Potential Impact of Airline Mergers and 
Industry  Consolidation.’’  As  you  may  recall,  at  that  time,  Delta  Air  Lines  was  the 
target  of  a  hostile  takeover  attempt  by  U.S.  Airways,  an  attempt  which  ultimately 
failed  due  in  large  part  to  the  extreme  opposition  demonstrated  by  Delta’s  employ-
ees.  At  that  time,  I  submitted  my  testimony  on  behalf  of  the  pilots  of  Delta  Air 
Lines, who stood solidly opposed to the hostile takeover attempt of our company.

Today,  I  am  submitting  testimony  on  a  distinctly  different  matter,  the  proposed 
merger between Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, and I am testifying in sup-
port of the proposed merger. 

While you may ask whether I have changed my position on industry consolidation 
since I testified last year, nothing could he further from the truth. In fact, the posi-
tion  of  the  Delta  pilots’  union  has  been  clear  and  consistent  over  time.  Last  year, 
in opposition to U.S. Airways’ hostile takeover attempt, I wrote: 

Many  leading  industry  experts  suggest,  and  we  recognize,  that  eventually,  in-
dustry  consolidation  is  not  only  likely,  but  probable  and  perhaps  even  inevi-
table. With that in mind, I want to make the following point: 
We support a free market solution that includes rational industry consolidation; 
consolidation  that  does  not  lead  to  reduced  service,  increased  fares  and  other 
problems for the industry’s constituents. 
In  the  future,  sensible  airline  consolidation  opportunities  may  occur.  If  faced 
with such an opportunity, the pilots of Delta Air Lines are interested in partici-
pating  in  the  ‘‘right’’  consolidation  effort,  a  consensual  merger  with  a  rational 
mix of routes, employees and resources, and with the absence of major antitrust 
and  other  detrimental  issues.  The  ‘‘right’’  merger  opportunity  could  draw  our 
support  and  result  in  a  successful  merger  that  benefits  everyone  involved—the 
traveling  public,  the  corporations,  the  employees,  and  the  communities  we 
serve. 

The  hostile  attempt  by  U.S.  Airways  to  takeover  Delta  Air  Lines  was  not  that 
merger.  In  contrast,  the  proposed  merger  between  Delta  Air  Lines  and  Northwest 
Airlines is that ‘‘right’’ merger. 

On  September  11,  2001,  terrorists  used  commercial  airliners  as  weapons  of  mass 
destruction  to  attack  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  horrific  events  changed 
our  lives  forever  and  also  marked  the  beginning  of  drastic  change  for  America’s 
aviation  industry.  In  the  years  that  followed  the  airline  industry  was  rocked  by 
record  financial  losses,  skyrocketing  oil  prices  (which  are  a  bargain  in  comparison 
to  today’s  prices),  increased  security  costs,  and  numerous  airline  bankruptcies  and 
liquidations. In response Congress approved, and several airlines took advantage of 
government  backed  loans  through  the  Air  Transportation  Stabilization  Board 
(ATSB). 

Delta  and  Northwest  were  not  immune  from  the  pressures  of  the  post-9/11  envi-
ronment, and on the same day in September 2005, both corporations filed for protec-
tion  under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code.  At  the  time,  the  industry  was 
still  hemorrhaging,  and  many  familiar  with  the  economics  of  the  industry  believed 
that neither Delta nor Northwest would survive. 

But fueled in large part by substantial concessions from the pilots and our fellow 
employees, both companies were able to successfully reorganize and exit bankruptcy 
just  less  than  1  year  ago.  The  employees  of  both  carriers  were  able  to  take  pride 
in the part they played in the emergence of new, healthier, airlines—airlines poised 
for long-term success. In the months that followed, things seemed to go as planned, 
but  due  to  factors  beyond  the  control  of  any  airline  management  team  or  labor 
group, the industry soon faced increasing economic challenges on several fronts. 

When  Delta  and  Northwest  exited  bankruptcy  in  the  spring  of  2007,  crude  oil 
traded  in  the  mid-sixty  dollar  per  barrel  range.  This  week,  the  price  of  crude  set 
another  new  record  as  it  broke  through  $122  per  barrel,  an  increase  of  approxi-
mately  85  percent  in  less  than  1  year.  Additionally,  the  Nation’s  economy  is  suf-
fering,  and  many  economists  assert  that  we  are  entering  a  recession;  others  argue 
we  may  already  be  in  recession.  The  credit  markets  have  become  increasingly  dif-
ficult  if  not  impossible  to  access.  Just  last  month,  due  largely  to  the  unavailability 
of  debtor-in-possession  financing,  Aloha,  ATA  and  Skybus  ceased  operations,  and 
Champion  Air  will  shut  its  doors  on  May  31.  Frontier  Airlines  recently  filed  for 
Chapter  11  protection.  Legitimate  concerns  exist  about  the  long-term  financial  via-
bility of several other carriers. 

In  short,  for  the  second  time  since  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001, 
the industry’s long-term future—in fact, its survival—is in peril. If our nation’s air-
line  industry  is  to  survive,  the  economics  of  that  industry  overwhelmingly  suggest 
that the time for long- anticipated industry consolidation has arrived. 

In the months leading up to the proposed merger, the Delta pilots worked closely 
with  our  company’s  senior  management  team  as  we  considered  what  was  best  for 
our  company,  its  employees,  our  passengers  and  the  communities  we  serve.  As  the 
union  representing  the  Delta  pilots,  we  made  clear  that  we  were  not  interested  in 
a  transaction  for  transaction’s  sake.  We  insisted  that  if  a  merger  were  to  draw  our 
support,  several  conditions  would  have  to  be  met,  and  the  most  important  of  these

was  that  the  combination  would  produce  an  even  stronger  and  growing  airline  that 
would  vigorously  and  successfully  compete  in  the  domestic  and  international  mar-
ketplaces for years to come. 

The  proposed  merger  between  Delta  Air  Lines  and  Northwest  Airlines  not  only 

meets but exceeds the conditions necessary to draw our support. 

The  proposed  merger  between  Delta  and  Northwest  is  far  different  from  the  one 
that  would  have  resulted  had  U.S.  Airways  been  successful  in  its  attempt  to  take 
over  Delta.  Delta  and  U.S.  Airways  are  strong  competitors  in  many  markets,  with 
large  overlapping  route  structures  and  several  hub  city  pairs  located  in  close  geo-
graphic  proximity.  Had  that  takeover  attempt  succeeded,  it  would  have  cost  thou-
sands  of  jobs,  created  monopolization  in  key  business  markets,  resulted  in  huh  clo-
sures and eliminated customer choice, all in the name of a short-term financial gain 
for a few. 

In  contrast,  the  proposed  merger  between  Delta  and  Northwest  represents  an 
‘‘end  to  end’’  merger  with  far  different  dynamics.  Delta  and  Northwest  have  very 
little  route  overlap  both  domestically  and  internationally,  and  in  fact  have  com-
plementary  route  structures  that  will  expand  opportunities  to  the  traveling  public. 
Further,  as  the  surviving  management  team,  Delta’s  senior  executives  have  com-
mitted  to  preserving  frontline  employee  jobs  and  that  hubs  will  remain  open.  Over 
the weeks and months leading up to the merger announcement, Delta management 
shared  its  financial  projections  and  merger  analyses  with  the  Air  Line  Pilots  Asso-
ciation, and we were able to validate the results with our own independent analysis 
which  showed  very  similar  results.  The  value  in  the  proposed  merger  will  manifest 
itself  not  at  the  expense  of  employees,  passengers  and  communities  served,  but  by 
the synergies of the combined strength of both carriers. As a result, the merger will 
serve  the  interests  of  the  corporation,  the  approximately  78,000  employees  of  the 
merged  company,  the  communities  we  serve  and  most  importantly,  the  lifeblood  of 
our company, our passengers. 

Finally,  you  are  all  aware  that  one  of  the  most  difficult  tasks  of  any  merger  is 
that  of  workforce  integration.  As  the  probability  of  consolidation  increased,  the 
Delta  pilots’  union  recognized  that  the  traditional  approach  to  labor  integration  is 
flawed, if not completely broken. That is why we made the decision last fall to pro-
vide  our  pilot  membership  with  an  alternative  to  the  traditional  process.  Our  goal 
was  to  reach  an  agreement  with  the  Northwest  pilots  on  the  most  contentious  of 
labor issues in advance of a merger announcement. The task was extremely difficult 
and Herculean efforts were made by representatives from both pilots groups. While 
significant  progress  was  made  in  many  areas,  we  were  unable  to  reach  agreement 
on  an  integrated  seniority  list  in  advance  of  the  merger  announcement.  However, 
with  the  probability  of  a  merger  announcement  on  the  horizon  and  the  timeline 
shrinking,  the  Delta  pilots’  union  leadership  was  able  to  reach  an  agreement  with 
Delta  management  designed  to  facilitate  the  merger  while  providing  financial  re-
turns  for  the  value  we  would  bring  to  the  transaction.  That  agreement  is  currently 
before our pilot membership for ratification. 

An  important  part  of  that  agreement  was  a  unanimous  commitment  on  the  part 
of Delta’s pilot union leaders that ‘‘the Delta [union leadership] welcomes the North-
west pilots as partners in the building of the new merged airline and looks forward 
to  working  with  the  Northwest  [union  leadership]  to  bring  about  the  rapid  comple-
tion  of  a  new  joint  agreement  to  take  effect  on  the  closing  of  the  corporate  trans-
action  providing  immediate  parity  in  rates  of  pay  and  further  providing  for  a  rapid 
completion of a fair and equitable integrated seniority list to take effect on the effec-
tive date of the new joint agreement.’’ 

The  Delta  pilots  have  a  long  and  proud  history  of  treating  each  other  fairly  and 
acting with the best interests of our fellow pilots, as demonstrated by our successful 
integrations  of  the  pilots  of  Northeast  Air  Lines  in  the  1970s,  Western  Airlines  in 
the  1980s,  and  Pan  Am  in  the  1990s.  Make  no  mistake,  once  the  corporate  trans-
action closes, the Delta and Northwest pilots will all be Delta pilots. Our ethics, our 
integrity and our record of fairness and professionalism will not be compromised as 
we transition to a group over 12,000 strong. 
Conclusion 

In  the  years  following  the  September  11  attacks,  the  American  aviation  industry 
experienced  its  worst  period  in  history  up  to  that  point.  After  numerous  corporate 
restructurings,  both  in  and  out  of  bankruptcy,  there  were  strong  indications  of  an 
industry on the rebound. Due to factors beyond the control of any management team 
or  labor  group,  that  rebound  was  short-lived.  The  health  and  viability  of  America’s 
iconic aviation industry, an industry that helps drive our nation’s economy, is in se-
rious jeopardy, and while it may seem inconceivable, it is quite possible—even prob-
able—that circumstances will get much worse before they get better.

In  my  opening  remarks,  I  acknowledged  that  careful  government  scrutiny  and 
oversight must ensure that any potential industry consolidation is in the best inter-
ests  of  the  traveling  public.  I  submit  that  the  proposed  merger  between  Delta  Air 
Lines  and  Northwest  Airlines  is  not  only  in  the  best  interests  of  the  traveling  pub-
lic, but also our Nation’s aviation industry and economy. 

On  behalf  of  the  over  7,300  professional  pilots  of  Delta  Air  Lines,  thank  you  for 

the opportunity to testify before the Committee. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT MECHANICS FRATERNAL ASSOCIATION 

I am Steve MacFarlane, National Director of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal As-
sociation  (AMFA),  a  craft  union  representing  4,200  aviation  mechanics  and  related 
at  Alaska,  ATA,  Southwest,  Northwest  (NWA),  Mesaba,  and  Horizon.  AMFA  rep-
resents  over  900  mechanics  at  NWA,  and  over  200  at  Mesaba—one  of  NWA’s  re-
gional  subsidiaries.  I  am  writing  to  share  my  organization’s  concerns  regarding 
mergers and consolidation within the airline industry, specifically the proposed deal 
between Delta and Northwest. Having worked in the airline industry for twenty-five 
years and lived through two mergers, Hughes Airwest/Republic and Republic/North-
west, I can attest first hand to the harm that can befall workers caught up in airline 
mergers. 

AMFA  understands  that  consolidation  within  the  industry  is  likely,  and  we  are 
not  necessarily  opposed  to  consolidation  per  se,  however,  AMFA  believes  there  are 
facts  surrounding  the  Delta-  NWA  pairing  that  need  to  be  addressed.  These  issues 
include, but are not limited to: 

turn to work will expire on November 6, 2008. 

• The  500  NWA  mechanics  currently  on  furlough,  whose  last  opportunity  to  re-
• Current and potential future union representation at the combined carrier. 
• Billions of dollars in outstanding pension obligations. 
• The  potential  wave  of  mergers  stemming  from  the  approval  of  the  Delta-NWA 
• Promises  made  by  management  teams  to  garner  political  favor  for  deals  that 
turn out to cause great harm, such as pledges to keep all hubs, employees, and 
small community air service. 

deal. 

Having endured devastating job losses and drastic reductions in pay and benefits 
coerced from airline workers throughout the industry over the past 5 years, we can’t 
help  but  flinch  at  the  prospect  of  another  corporate  tactic  that  has  the  potential  of 
delivering yet another blow to the livelihoods of airline workers. Prior to the attacks 
of  9/11,  AMFA  represented  nearly  10,000  mechanics  and  related  at  NWA.  Imme-
diately after the attacks, tens of thousands of frontline airline employees at numer-
ous  carriers  were  laid  off,  including  about  half  of  AMFA’s  NWA  population.  Today, 
the number stands at 910. AMFA members in Minnesota numbered over 6,000 dur-
ing  the  late  90s  alone.  These  workers  earned  above  average  wages,  owned  homes, 
and  contributed  significantly  to  the  economy  of  Minnesota  and  the  Nation  as  a 
whole.  There  are  now  615  AMFA  NWA  mechanics  at  MSP  and  300  in  Detroit 
(DTW). Most of them own homes in other states. 

AMFA  currently  has  approximately  400  Technicians  and  a  little  less  than  100 
cleaners  on  nonvoluntary  furlough.  In  order  for  us  to  support  the  merger  NWA 
needs to insure these employees are given the opportunity to return to work for the 
‘‘New  Delta’’.  Many  of  these  furloughed  employees  were  working  for  NWA  long  be-
fore  Mr.  Steenland  or  Mr.  Anderson  joined  NWA;  some  of  these  men  and  women 
have  20  plus  years  at  NWA.  NWA  and  Delta  have  been  unwilling  to  even  sit  down 
with  AMFA  to  discuss  our  concerns.  It  seems  they  feel  the  only  group  they  need 
to  get  buy-in  from  is  the  pilot  group.  Thousands  of  other  employees  and  their  rep-
resentatives have needs and concerns that need to be addressed as well. 

On  November  6,  2008  the  approximate  500  employees  on  non-voluntary  furlough 
will  be  terminated  as  a  result  of  the  expiration  of  their  recall  rights.  NWA  arbi-
trarily  reduced  the  recall  period  from  5  years  to  2  years  in  our  strike  settlement 
agreement.  The  ‘‘New  Delta’’  could  show  some  good  faith  to  support  their  claims 
that they intend to protect jobs by: 

• Reestablishing  the  original  five-year  recall  rights  which  would  extend  by  3 
years  the  November  6,  2008  termination  deadline  currently  looming  over  the 
heads  of  hundreds  of  NWA  employees.  Unless  this  action  is  taken  approxi-
mately 500 NWA mechanic and related employees will be terminated in Novem-
ber  of  this  year.  By  taking  this  action  these  long  time  NWA  employees  would 
simply be given the opportunity to bid for a job as they became available.

• Offer the furloughed employees that have recently reached the age of 55 the op-
portunity  to  return  to  work  for  one  day  in  order  to  retire  active,  which  would 
increase  their  pension  payments  by  hundreds  of  dollars  per  month.  NWA  has 
been  given  a  freeze  on  benefit  accruals  and  many  years  of  relief  from  the  gov-
ernment to fund their pension obligations. The ‘‘New Delta’’ should be required 
to at least live up to their end of the agreement by paying the full value of the 
pension  and  not  receive  yet  another  opportunity  to  short  change  their  retire-
ment eligible employees by terminating them. 
• Offer  the  rule-of-60  flight  benefits  to  those  currently  on  furlough  (age  +  yrs  of 
service  =  60).  This  action  would  result  in  lifetime  retired  employee  flight  bene-
fits,  something  offered  to  all  employees  that  chose  to  resign  but  not  those  who 
chose the furlough. 

Former mechanics have, in many cases, moved on to lower-paying jobs and turned 
to  refinancing  homes  or  other  forms  of  debt  to  sustain  their  families.  This  scenario 
shows  that  for  all  the  numbers  thrown  around  about  how  vital  an  airline  is  to  an 
economy—both  micro  and  macro—the  benefits  must  be  more  than  residents  with 
proximity  to  a  certain  airport  being  able  to  fly  to  Mexico  City  via  Salt  Lake  City. 
With  no  economic  base  to  support  leisure  travel,  and  the  forecasted  ‘‘15–20  percent 
rise  in  ticket  prices’’ 1 needed  to  offset  soaring  fuel  prices,  the  current  crisis  in  the 
industry  will,  by  this  logic,  expand  to  the  point  where  no  one  will  be  able  to  fly. 
The  government  has  provided  great  assistance  to  the  airline  industry  after  911 
and  during  difficult  times,  in  the  form  of  the  ATSB,  whereby  $5B  in  taxpayer  dol-
lars  was  given  to  the  industry  without  any  guidance  as  to  how  the  airlines  were 
to spend the money. Another $10B was made available for loans to assist the ailing 
industry.  While  this  is  laudable,  no  help  was  forthcoming  to  the  tens  of  thousands 
of workers who lost their jobs. 

Additionally,  Federal  bankruptcy  laws,  never  intended  to  be  used  as  a  strategic 
tool  for  competitive  purposes,  were  turned  against  workers  as  Federal  judges  aided 
executive  management  teams  in  extracting  severe,  painful,  and  permanent  conces-
sions from American airline workers. Pensions were defaulted, work rules changed, 
work  forces  reduced  by  thousands,  wages  slashed,  and  on  and  on.  We  acknowledge 
the value and benefit of having a viable airline industry that provides great mobility 
and swift commerce for our nation; however, the other part of the equation is a sta-
ble  and  productive  middle  class  that  contributes  to  the  economic  vibrance  and  tax 
base of the American economy. 

Now,  as  we  enter  the  era  of  Open  Skies  and  mega-carriers,  the  need  for  scrutiny 
grows. NWA and Delta claim that employees will be given a 4 percent stake in the 
merged company. Employees at United Airlines can attest to the perks of ESOP pro-
grams,  where  $125,000  in  stock  yielded  a  $1,800  payout.  This  merger  does  nothing 
to allay concerns of future bankruptcy filings, and future financial distress. In fact, 
the  cost  of  merging  has  been  reported  to  be  somewhere  near  $1  billion.  Given  the 
combined  $10  billion  in  losses  by  NWA  and  Delta  in  the  first  quarter  of  2008,  it 
seems  the  carriers  need  all  the  money  they  can  get.  Even  without  ‘‘one-time’’  costs 
of  $6  billion  for  Delta  and  $4  Billion  for  NWA,  the  two  combined  to  lose  just  short 
of $500 million in the quarter—largely due to $115/bbl oil. 

Oil and refined fuel commodity prices will not decrease with the formation of the 
largest airline in the world. With this merger, the company will have a fleet of over 
800  aircraft,  with  the  only  overlap  in  aircraft  type  being  the  Boeing  757–200 
(Delta—131;  NWA—71).2 This  means  the  combined  carrier  will  have  19  different 
and  unique  aircraft,  and  a  fleet  that  will  be  one  of  the  oldest  in  the  industry.  The 
companies  have  said  that  the  carrier  will  be  able  to  right  size  aircraft  to  specific 
routes,  and  park  older  airplanes,  but  both  airlines  have  stated  their  individual  in-
tentions  to  do  this  in  the  next  year  anyway,  as  well  announcing  cuts  in  mainline 
capacity. The costs of the merger procedure fly in the face of the actions the compa-
nies are taking independently. 

Earlier  in  the  month,  Delta,  NWA,  Air  France-KLM,  CSA  Czech  Airlines  and 
Alitalia were granted antitrust immunity for their international code-share alliance 
operations as part of the SkyTeam Alliance. This, combined with Stage I of the US- 
EU  Open  Skies  Agreement  (OSA),  appears  to  be  leading  to  the  creation  of  global 
mega-carriers,  and  with  it,  the  gradual  erosion  of  the  traditional  airline  employee. 
If  not  for  U.S.  ownership  and  ‘‘actual  control’’  restrictions,  perhaps  trans-Atlantic 
consolidation  would  have  been  realized  already.  In  fact,  Stage  I  of  the  OSA  stipu-
lates  that  if  the  U.S.  does  not  liberalize  its  ownership  requirements  for  a  Stage  II 
agreement, Stage I will be negated and withdrawn.

While many employees would likely welcome being part of the world’s largest air 
carrier, that endorsement cannot come without some tangible benefits. Airlines have 
lost  $29  billion  since  2001,  defaulted  or  deferred  over  $20  billion  in  pension  obliga-
tions,  and  laid  off  over  150,000  employees.  These  facts  show  that  something  funda-
mental  must  change.  But,  how  does  this  merger,  and  the  likely  wave  of  mergers  to 
follow  afterward,  change  anything?  It  seems  more  likely  a  continuation  down  the 
same pothole-laden path. 

Again,  AMFA  is  not  against  Delta  and  Northwest  merging,  but  we  are  hard 
pressed to see how this betters the industry and provides stability to its employees. 
At a minimum, Delta’s mechanics must be given a fair chance to vote on representa-
tion.  AMFA  has  received  a  significant  number  of  NMB  cards,  and  stands  to  vie  for 
representation  in  the  event  that  this  merger  is  approved.  If  the  workers  of  the 
merged  carrier  choose  no  representation  through  a  vote,  then  so  be  it.  But,  we  feel 
that  in  the  current  environment,  the  mechanics  at  a  combined  Delta  will  see  that 
as  at-will  employees,  they  will  have  little  recourse  in  the  event  of  another  severe 
industry downturn. 

We  hope  that  all  the  promises  made  by  Mr.  Steenland  and  Mr.  Anderson  come 
to  fruition  and  this  merger  works  well  for  everyone  involved.  But  sadly,  rank  and 
file airline employees have been down this road before, and historically it has ended 
with  thousands  of  layoffs  for  airline  workers  and  a  few  golden  parachutes  at  the 
top for executives. 

PREPARED STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE MINNESOTA PARTIES 1 

Introduction 

Chairman Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, Members of the Committee, we submit 
this  testimony  on  behalf  of  the  Minnesota  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  Minneapolis 
Regional  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  Saint  Paul  Area  Chamber  of  Commerce  and 
the  Metropolitan  Coalition  of  Chambers  representing  thousands  of  businesses 
throughout  the  state  of  Minnesota.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  file  testimony 
on  a  matter  of  great  importance  to  all  of  the  residents  of  the  Twin  Cities  and  Min-
nesota. 

The  Twin  Cities  business  community  was  a  driving  force  behind  the  growth  and 
development of Northwest Airlines. The carrier took flight in 1927 thanks to the de-
termined  efforts  of  civic  leaders  who  recognized  the  importance  of  good  air  service 
for  the  progress  of  the  Twin  Cities  and  the  development  of  its  economy.  From  its 
first flights as a mail carrier and over the next 82 years, Northwest has contributed 
to the Twin Cities’ and Minnesota’s economy far beyond even the bold visions of its 
founders.  Today,  Northwest  operates  475  daily  flights  from  Minneapolis/St.  Paul 
International Airport to more than 150 destinations, including nonstop international 
service to Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, and beginning this month, Paris. 

It’s  impossible  for  proud  Minnesotans  like  us  to  not  have  mixed  emotions  about 
last week’s merger announcement. Northwest is as much a part of our state as our 
lakes,  our  winters  and  our  hockey.  Even  so,  Minnesota  businesses  recognize  that 
this  merger  is  an  economic  necessity  for  both  airlines  in  an  era  of  unprecedented 
pressures from record oil prices, economic distress and competition. 

We  also  recognize  and  expect  that,  while  the  Northwest  name  may  cease,  the  air 
service  that  drives  billions  of  dollars  of  economic  activity  will  go  forward  under  the 
Delta  banner.  Minneapolis/St.  Paul  will  continue  as  a  major,  primary  and  growing 
airline  hub,  providing  economic  benefits  to  the  Twin  Cities  and  the  entire  upper 
Midwest region. Both Delta and Northwest have pledged to grow—and strengthen— 
our hub, to maintain substantial management and line operations in Minnesota and 
to  continue  to  be  one  of  our  largest  employers.  The  new  Delta  has  the  opportunity 
to use its financial strength and the superior network to serve Minnesota better; to 
provide  greater  job  security  for  its  employees;  and,  to  catalyze  economic  activity 
statewide. 

The MSP hub has been and will continue to be critical to the ongoing development 
of our economy. The benefits of the hub—frequent, non-stop service to a wide range 
of  domestic  and  international  destinations—makes  it  easy  for  our  citizens  to  travel 
for business and leisure and—even more importantly—for the world to come to Min-
nesota  to  do  business  with  us  and  to  experience  our  natural  and  cultural  beauty. 

The numbers, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, are compelling. 

1 This testimony is offered on behalf of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, Minneapolis Re-
gional Chamber of Commerce, Saint Paul Area Chamber of Commerce and the Metropolitan Co-
alition  of  Chambers,  representing  thousands  of  businesses  throughout  the  State  of  Minnesota.

In  2004,  the  most  recent  data  available,  our  airport  generated  153,000  jobs,  $6.0 
billion  in  personal  income,  $10.7  billion  in  business  revenue,  $1.3  billion  in  sales, 
and  $626  million  in  local/state  taxes.2 In  2000,  2001,  2002,  and  again  in  2004,  the 
International  Air  Transport  Association  named  MSP  ‘‘the  Best  Large  Airport  in 
North America’’, as measured by overall consumer satisfaction. In 2004, J.D. Power 
and Associates ranked MSP as the 3rd best large airport in the world, after Frank-
furt and Denver. 

According  to  the  U.S.  Census  Statistical  Abstracts  (2007),  Minnesota’s  compound 
annual growth rate (in terms of Gross State Product) ranked 9th among the 20 larg-
est states, ahead of states with much larger gross state products like New York, Illi-
nois, and Pennsylvania. Minnesota is also home to large, world-class companies, in-
cluding the headquarters of 19 Fortune 500 public companies (2007) and 12 Forbes 
500  private  corporations  (2007)  representing  a  broad  spectrum  of  industries.  3M, 
U.S.  Bancorp,  Target,  General  Mills,  United  Health  Group,  Cargill,  and  Medtronic 
each call Minnesota home, and many of these large companies have business inter-
ests  or  operations  in  foreign  countries—in  part  because  of  the  ease  of  travel  across 
the  Northwest  network.  Not  surprisingly,  the  strong  metropolitan,  statewide,  and 
regional  fundamentals—the  product  of  a  well-diversified  economy  and  an  economic 
base of world-class corporations—generate substantial demand for air service. 

There  are,  of  course,  many  factors  that  make  our  state’s  economy  what  it  is,  but 
a  necessary  ingredient  for  our  success  is  the  hub  and  particularly  its  health  and 
continued  growth.  Its  current  status  and  future  growth  are  secured  by  the  commit-
ments of the merged airline’s board of directors and management. 

Implementation  of  this  promise  will  rest  with  thousands  of  front-line  employees 
who work on the ground and in the air. These employees are protected by a promise 
of no involuntary furloughs and a commitment that any employee who wants to stay 
with  the  combined  airline  will  have  a  job.  Bankruptcies  and  high  oil  prices  present 
a much greater threat to airline employees than mergers. In fact, the airline indus-
try  has  lost  over  150,000  jobs  since  2001  (USDOT  Form  41  data)  through  bank-
ruptcy and recession. Five U.S. airlines have failed so far this year due to high fuel 
prices  and  a  struggling  economy.  The  combined  airline  will  be  better  able  to  meet 
those challenges. 
The  Merged  Airline  Will  Provide  Minneapolis/st.  Paul  and  the  Upper 

Midwest with a Superior Global Network 

The  new  Delta  will  be  America’s  premier  global  airline  with  service  to  more  des-
tinations  around  the  world  than  any  other  carrier.  Combining  Northwest’s  heritage 
in Canada and Asia with Delta’s network throughout the Caribbean, Latin America, 
Europe,  the  Middle  East  and  Africa  creates  a  larger,  more  attractive  network  than 
either airline can offer alone. This ‘‘network effect’’ as it’s called makes it easier for 
the  new  airline  to  enter  new  and  underserved  markets  and  attracts  new  customers 
who  want  the  convenience  and  familiarity  of  a  single  global  airline.  The  expanded 
Delta  network  will  strengthen  and  preserve  the  primacy  of  our  Twin  Cities  hub  by 
making it economical to serve more destinations and provide more schedule options. 
Hubs  are  particularly  valuable  because  of  the  international  service  they  support. 
Nonstop international air service is very important to our state and region, and the 
combination  of  Northwest’s  and  Delta’s  global  networks  will  enhance  its  ability  to 
sustain  and—we  expect—expand  those  services.  It’s  worth  noting—and  it  certainly 
hasn’t  escaped  the  notice  of  both  Northwest’s  and  Delta’s  leadership—that  MSP  is 
the  northernmost  hub  airport  in  the  eastern  half  of  the  United  States,  making  it 
geographically desirable for non-stop service to Asia. 
Delta/Northwest  Will  Not  Change 

the  Competitive  Landscape 

in 

Minneapolis/St. Paul 

Northwest has 475 daily departures, whereas Delta has about 17 daily departures 
from  Minneapolis/St.  Paul.  The  disparity  in  service  at  MSP  illustrates  the  overall 
complementary nature of these route networks, which have very little overlap. Min-
neapolis/St.  Paul  is  served  by  three  discount  carriers  and  by  the  four  other  major 
legacy  carriers.  Accordingly,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  combination  of  Delta  and 
Northwest will have any appreciable effect on customers.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area and the State of Minnesota Are 
a  Large,  Prosperous,  and  Growing  Community  That  Depends  on  Air 
Travel Service 

Minneapolis-St.  Paul  is  a  large,  dynamic,  and  prosperous  metropolitan  area  with 
a  long  history  as  a  major  transportation  hub.  Our  rivers  and  railroads  were  the 
transportation networks of their times and the forerunners of today’s global air trav-
el  network.  Minnesota  is  home  to  hundreds  of  international  companies,  to  a  long 
list of distinguished colleges and universities—including one of the most productive 
research universities in the world in the University of Minnesota—and is an impor-
tant center for tourism with attractions ranging from Mall of America to the region’s 
extraordinary  wilderness  and  natural  grandeur.  Our  community  has  enjoyed  sub-
stantial  growth  and  economic  prosperity  in  recent  times  largely  because  our  means 
of  ‘‘making  a  living’’  has  evolved  constantly.  A  key  ingredient  to  that  evolution  has 
been the hub at MSP. For our economic evolution and success to continue, we must 
be  able  to  reach  the  world  and  the  world  must  be  able  to  reach  us—reliably  and 
at  a  competitive  price.  We  believe  this  merger  increases  our  chances  of  being  able 
to do just that well into the future. 
Conclusion 

We  know  that  much  of  our  good  fortune  over  the  years  has  been  the  product  of 
being a transportation hub. We believe our future is best guaranteed by continuing 
to play that role for our businesses and citizens who call Minnesota home, for those 
who  want  to  do  business  with  us;  for  those  who  want  to  visit;  and,  for  those  who 
simply  want  an  efficient  and  convenient  waypoint  on  their  journeys.  We  will  miss 
and  remember  the  Northwest  name  as  it  gives  way  to  Delta;  we  will  credit  it  for 
creating  and  sustaining  the  hub  at  MSP;  and  we  will  benefit  from  its  legacy  every 
time we board a Delta flight for a nonstop domestic or international destination. For 
these  reasons,  we  believe  a  merger  between  Delta  and  Northwest  can  create  the 
synergies to help fuel the development and growth of our economy. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE MEMPHIS REGIONAL CHAMBER 

AND THE MEMPHIS/SHELBY COUNTY AIRPORT AUTHORITY 

Introduction 

The Memphis Regional Chamber and the Memphis/Shelby County Airport Author-
ity  firmly  believe  that  approval  of  the  proposed  merger  of  Northwest  and  Delta  is 
the  best  way  to  secure  and  promote  Memphis’s  status  as  a  major  airline  passenger 
hub.  The  combination  of  the  two  carriers  will  create  America’s  premier  global  air-
line. The new airline will have the financial strength and a better network to serve 
the  Memphis  community,  provide  greater  job  security  and  growth,  make  the  avia-
tion industry more stable, and benefit the U.S. economy overall. 

It  is  no  coincidence  that  two  major  airlines  have  established  hubs  in  Memphis. 
Northwest  and  its  Airlink  carriers  operate  more  than  230  daily  passenger  flights, 
and FedEx has developed Memphis into the world’s busiest air cargo hub. Memphis 
is  ideally  located  in  the  south  central  United  States—near  the  center  of  the  U.S. 
population  base.  Moreover,  Memphis  has  a  strong  regional  economy  and  skilled 
work force, which contributes to the success of our two airline hub operations. 

Northwest is our hometown passenger carrier, and has served the Memphis com-
munity well for over two decades. It is important to remember, however, that Mem-
phis  became  a  Northwest  hub  by  virtue  of  Northwest’s  merger  with  Republic  Air-
lines  in  1986.  And,  before  that,  Republic  was  created  when  Southern  and  North 
Central  merged  in  1979.  Simply  put,  mergers,  acquisitions  (and  airline  failures) 
have been a prominent feature of the airline industry since deregulation. Yet, Mem-
phis  has  endured  as  a  hub.  Based  on  the  ‘‘business  case’’  of  MEM  as  a  proven  and 
successful hub—as well as the specific assurances we have received from Delta and 
Northwest that there will be no hub closures—we fully expect Memphis to continue 
to play an important role to the combined carrier after the merger.

With  mounting  pressures  from  low  cost  carriers,  as  well  as  sky-high  oil  prices, 
many believe that consolidation among the major legacy carriers is inevitable. From 
Memphis’s  perspective,  the  end-to-end  combination  of  Northwest  and  Delta  creates 
the greatest opportunity for stability and growth, with the least amount of overlap. 
The  merger  will  allow  for  more  efficient  use  of  the  companies’  combined  strategic 
assets  and  thereby  strengthen  the  economies  of  the  communities  served  by  the  two 
airlines. The scale and strength of the new global airline will make jobs more secure 
and provide a better quality of life for employees. 
The  Proposed  Merger  Will  Help  to  Secure  Jobs  and  Airline  Activity  at  the 

Memphis Hub 

Together, Northwest and Delta employ about 4,000 people in Tennessee, the vast 
majority of whom are frontline employees working in Memphis. According to the two 
airlines,  these  employees  of  both  airlines  are  protected  by  a  promise  of  no  involun-
tary  furloughs  and  a  commitment  that  any  employee  who  wants  to  stay  with  the 
combined airline will have a job. 

The  biggest  threats  to  airline  jobs  are  not  mergers  but  bankruptcies  and  high  oil 
prices.  Since  2001,  the  airline  industry  has  lost  over  150,000  jobs  through  bank-
ruptcy and recession; and, in the first half of this year, fuel prices have permanently 
grounded five U.S. airlines. The proposed merger helps mitigate those threats. 
The Merged Airline Will Connect Memphis and the Mid-South Region to the 

World 

The  combined  company  will  offer  service  to  more  destinations  around  the  world 
than any other U.S. carrier. By combining Northwest’s leading positions in Canada 
and  Asia  with  Delta’s  strength  across  the  Caribbean,  Latin  America,  Europe,  the 
Middle East and Africa, customers and communities will benefit from enhanced ac-
cess  to  destinations  worldwide.  Even  with  its  new  runway,  Atlanta  is  operating  at 
capacity.  Memphis  provides  the  combined  carrier  with  a  flexible  and  less  congested 
alternative  to  transport  connecting  passengers  throughout  the  Southeastern  United 
States.  Moreover,  the  expanded  network  of  the  combined  carrier  will  provide  Mem-
phis  and  the  surrounding  areas  with  potential  opportunities  for  economic  develop-
ment, new investment and increased tourism. 

Northwest  provides  Memphis  with  its  only  nonstop  passenger  service  to  Europe 
(Memphis-Amsterdam). We are very pleased that the Department of Transportation 
recently approved antitrust immunity to Delta, Northwest, and their respective Eu-
ropean partners, Air France and KLM. By creating a merger with the SkyTeam Alli-
ance, the potential for service disruptions is minimized. 
Competition Among Carriers in Memphis Will Continue to Thrive 

The combination of Delta and Northwest will not change the competitive environ-
ment for customers in Memphis. Delta has 14 daily departures from Memphis, while 
Northwest  has  233,  demonstrating  that  the  companies  have  complementary  route 
networks and very little overlap. Two discount carriers, AirTran and Frontier serve 
Memphis,  and  the  only  overlap  route  between  Northwest  and  Delta  (Memphis-At-
lanta) has competitive low cost service on AirTran. 
Memphis  Is  a  Diverse  and  Growing  Community  That  Is  Highly  Dependent 

on Air Service. 

Memphis is one of the most significant cities in the central United States for sev-
eral fundamental reasons. It is large, with a current metro population of more than 
1.2  million  which  is  forecast  to  exceed  1.3  million  by  the  end  of  this  decade.  It  has 
a  vibrant  and  growing  economy  on  many  levels.  Average  personal  income  for  resi-
dents of the Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area (‘‘MSA’’) is expected to continue 
its strong annual growth of 4.0 percent, reaching $42,017 by 2010. Memphis experi-
enced  $16.5  billion  in  retail  sales  for  2005,  and  those  sales  are  expected  to  surpass 
$20.5 billion by 2010 based on the continuation of its impressive decade-long growth 
rate of 4.4 percent per year. 

Given  its  central  location  at  the  intersection  of  Interstates  U.S.  40  and  U.S.  55 
(two of the principal highways in the central United States), Memphis International 
Airport, service by five of the six U.S. class-one railroads and the Mississippi River, 
Memphis  has  become  one  of  the  world’s  leading  intermodal  transportation  hubs— 
often being described as ‘‘America’s Distribution Center.’’ Specifically, Memphis pro-
vides  water-to/from-rail,  water-to/from-truck,  rail-to/from-truck,  and  air-to/from- 
truck  linkages.  More  than  300  motor  freight  companies  operate  in  the  Memphis 
MSA, from which 152 markets are served overnight, more than from any other city

Zones with multiple sites. More than $10 billion in goods clear customs in Memphis 
each year through twelve full-service customs brokers. 

Passenger  access  enables  so  much  of  Memphis’s  economic  vitality  from  Fortune 
500  companies  to  NBA  basketball  to  curing  childhood  diseases.  Memphis  is  home 
to  the  world  headquarters  of  FedEx,  AutoZone,  International  Paper,  and 
ServiceMaster.  Memphis’s  St.  Jude  Children’s  Research  Hospital  is  internationally 
recognized  for  its  pioneering  work  in  finding  cures  and  saving  children  with  cancer 
and  other  catastrophic  diseases.  Memphis  is  the  Nation’s  second-largest  center  for 
the manufacturing of orthopaedic devices. The Downtown Memphis area is enjoying 
a  rebirth,  with  growth  in  businesses,  restaurants,  and  commercial  and  residential 
properties  to  complement  its  diverse  arts  and  cultural  communities.  Its  historical 
and  ongoing  contributions  to  the  music  industry—Home  of  the  Blues,  Birthplace  of 
Rock & Roll, and Graceland—are world-renowned. Memphis is home to NBA basket-
ball’s Memphis Grizzlies. 

In  addition,  our  community  has  embarked  on  a  major  economic  development  ini-
tiative to ensure Memphis has a strong and diverse economy, fosters innovation and 
entrepreneurship,  and  advances  the  region’s  global  leadership  in  the  bioscience, 
music/film  and  logistics  industries.  This  will  ensure  the  strength  of  our  growing 
economy and citizenry. 

The Memphis International Airport has played a vitally important role in making 
Memphis  the  economically  vibrant  and  attractive  community  it  is.  In  the  2006  Fis-
cal Year, Memphis International Airport handled 10,853,934 passengers and an un-
surpassed 4,009,413 tons of cargo making it the largest air cargo hub in the world. 
Given  this  commercial  and  trade  activity,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  Memphis 
International Airport’s contribution to the local economy is substantial. Cargo oper-
ations  alone  generated  a  total  impact  of  more  than  $19.5  billion  in  2004  and  sup-
ported  a  total  of  155,872  jobs  with  total  earnings  of  nearly  $5.6  billion.1 The  direct 
and  indirect  economic  impact  of  passenger  services  was  almost  $1.2  billion,  sup-
porting  almost  10,000  jobs  with  total  earnings  in  excess  of  $340  million.  In  total, 
in 2004, the Memphis International Airport generated over $10 billion in direct ex-
penditures  and  created  an  economic  impact  output  of  more  than  $20.7  billion  and 
165,500  jobs.2 Community  leaders  are  determined  to  continue  the  strength  of  the 
airport by amplifying Memphis’s position as America’s Aerotropolis. 
Conclusion 

The Memphis Regional Chamber and the Memphis/Shelby County Airport Author-
ity welcomed the news of the Delta/Northwest merger announcement. This is, as the 
carriers  have  said,  ‘‘a  merger  of  addition,  not  subtraction.’’  Memphis  has  a  strong 
economy, a skilled labor force, and the airport infrastructure to attract and sustain 
air  service.  We  look  forward  to  continuing  to  play  a  vital  role  as  a  hub  city  for  the 
new Delta. 

President and CEO, Memphis Regional Chamber.

LARRY D. COX, 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE DETROIT REGIONAL CHAMBER 

JOHN W. MOORE, 

Chairman Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, Members of the Committee, thank you 

for the opportunity to appear before you today. 

With 23,000 members, the Detroit Regional Chamber is the largest local chamber 
of  commerce  in  the  country.  Our  mission  is  carried  out  by  attracting  new  business 
to  our  community,  through  public  policy  advocacy,  strategic  partnerships  and  by 
providing quality products and services for our members. 

Northwest Airlines has been—and remains—a very positive force for economic de-
velopment  in  the  Detroit  area.  The  presence  of  a  Northwest  hub  since  1986  and 
their  leadership  in  constructing  the  world-class  Ed  McNamara  terminal  at  the  De-
troit Metropolitan Airport is a testament to their commitment to our region. North-
west  Airlines  is  a  respected  and  admired  member  of  the  Detroit  regional  business 
community. 

The  Chamber  believes  the  Delta  and  Northwest  merger  will  enhance  the  Detroit 
Region’s  ability  to  compete  for  new  business  development,  for  tourism  and  as  both 
a  destination  and  waypoint  for  travelers.  The  prospects  for  this  merger  are  very

complementary  to  the  logistics  hub  and  aerotropolis  initiatives  being  aggressively 
pursued  by  our  business  community.  These  plans  envision  leveraging  the  region’s 
air,  land  and  sea  resources  to  establish  a  major  transportation  center  for  moving 
people and goods around the globe. Being a strong hub for a true global carrier will 
better help the region realize this goal. 

Detroit  Metropolitan  Airport  is  one  of  our  region’s  strongest  economic  develop-
ment assets. We believe the Northwest-Delta merger will position us to serve as the 
centerpiece  of  Delta’s  Midwest  network  and—through  that  expanded  network—im-
prove  our  access  to  destinations  throughout  the  globe.  The  combined  airline  will 
reach  more  cities  than  any  other  airline  and  will  be  better  positioned  to  compete 
for  travelers  on  a  global  basis.  Those  travelers,  in  turn,  will  enjoy  a  greater  expo-
sure to the business and leisure benefits our region can offer. 

Delta  and  Northwest  currently  generate  more  than  $11.5  billion  in  combined  an-
nual  economic  benefit  and  employ  approximately  9,150  people  in  Michigan.  Since 
this  is  a  merger  of  addition  (not  subtraction)  it  is  our  belief  that  the  economic  im-
pact on our region will grow. 

Current non-stop service to Japan, Gatwick airport in London and planned direct 
service to Heathrow airport in London and Shanghai, China provide needed service 
for our region’s automotive industry. 

Northwest’s  new  nonstop  service  to  Shanghai  will  benefit  key  Midwest  manufac-
turing interests with growing trade and growing ties to China. Michigan and North-
ern  Ohio  are  home  to  25  Fortune  500  companies  and  there  are  23  Chinese  firms 
doing  business  in  Metro  Detroit.  The  U.S.  auto  industry  is  in  the  process  of  rein-
venting  itself  to  become  more  competitive  and  more  efficient  in  the  global  market-
place, and Detroit auto manufactures have been investing in China. This burgeoning 
trade relationship creates substantial China passenger and cargo demand in Detroit 
and throughout the Midwest Heartland. 

The Wayne County Airport Authority estimates the benefit of new Shanghai serv-
ice  to  the  Michigan  economy  to  exceed  $160  million,  and  nonstop  Beijing  service  to 
produce an additional $105 million in benefits, for a combined total of $265 million. 
We  are  pleased  that  the  combined  airline  is  committed  to  maintaining  Detroit  as 
a  hub  airport  and  we  believe  that  its  larger  network  will  make  additional  inter-
national  routes  possible.  We  look  forward  to  an  expansion  of  direct  service  to  des-
tinations in great demand by our business community as a result of the merger. We 
expect  the  combination  to  eventually  open  up  opportunities  for  direct  connections 
from  Detroit  to  Latin  America  and  South  America—areas  of  great  interest  to  busi-
nesses throughout our region. 

The  merger  combines  Delta’s  strengths  in  the  South,  Mountain  West,  Northeast, 
Europe and Latin America with Northwest’s leading positions in the Midwest, Can-
ada and Asia. At the same time, we agree with the observation that competition will 
be preserved and enhanced. Detroit Metro Airport is currently served by 17 domes-
tic and international airlines, including five discount carriers; that situation will not 
change appreciably as a result of this merger. In addition, Northwest and Delta cur-
rently operate complementary networks with relatively little overlap. 

Building  on  both  airlines’  long  history  of  serving  small  communities,  the  new 
Delta will improve worldwide connections to small towns and cities across the U.S., 
enhancing  their  access  to  the  global  marketplace.  Following  the  merger,  Delta  will 
serve more than 140 small communities in the United States—more than any other 
airline.  In  Michigan,  the  airline  will  serve  Detroit,  Lansing,  Kalamazoo,  Flint, 
Grand  Rapids,  Muskegon,  Saginaw,  Traverse  City,  Alpena,  Pellston,  Sault  Ste. 
Marie, Marquette, Escanaba, Iron Mountain, and Hancock. Many of our smaller cit-
ies  in  Michigan  are  dependent  on  the  continued  strength  and  growth  of  Northwest 
Airlines;  we  believe  the  merger  is  good  for  these  communities  and  for  all  of  Michi-
gan. 

The  merger  will  strengthen  the  combined  airline  and  our  community  by  giving  it 
a greater ability to withstand the crushing effect of high oil prices. As oil continues 
to set new all-time highs practically on a daily basis, American companies must find 
creative  management  strategies  to  remain  competitive  internationally.  The  merger 
will  make  the  cost  of  fuel  a  smaller  percentage  of  the  over-all  cost  structure  of  the 
firm  and  will  allow  them  to  participate  in  greater  long-term  price  hedging  strate-
gies. 

Again, thank you for this opportunity to comment on the proposed merger of Delta 
and Northwest Airlines. We fully support the merger and would hope that the mem-
bers of the Committee will join us in that position.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

PATRICK V. MURPHY, JR. 

Question  1.  A  merged  Delta/Northwest  airline  is  expected  to  have  a  total  of  20 
percent  market  share  in  the  domestic  marketplace.  What  impact  will  additional 
mergers  that  are  currently  anticipated  have  on  nationwide  market  share  domesti-
cally and internationally? 

Answer.  The  Delta/Northwest  merger  now  appears  to  be  the  only  major  airline 
merger on the horizon for 2008. The macroeconomic pressures from a slowing econ-
omy and soaring fuel prices have caused other carriers to forego additional mergers 
for the time being as they look to hunker down and attempt to ride out the current 
economic  storm  without  the  added  cost  burden  of  undertaking  a  merger.  Neverthe-
less, should one or two additional network airline mergers be completed in the mid- 
term future, the impact will be to reduce the number of airlines but not necessarily 
competition at the national level. There have been 15 to 17 airlines with a 1 percent 
or greater U.S. domestic market share during each of the past 20 years. New entry 
continues,  and  the  industry  is  very  competitive.  In  fact,  it  is  the  low-cost  carriers 
like Southwest, Jet Blue and AirTran that are driving much of the price competition 
and  growth  in  the  domestic  market.  Mergers  by  network  carriers  would  not  nec-
essarily  change  that  situation,  although  airline  concentration  levels  would  rise  in 
the  short  to  medium  term.  In  the  long  term,  low  cost  carriers’  growth  could  return 
concentration levels to 2008 levels. 

In  the  international  arena  the  expected  network  airline  merger  partners  often 
have  complementary  route  systems,  e.g.,  Delta  strong  over  the  Atlantic  and  North-
west strong over the Pacific. Again, mergers could raise concentration measures, but 
competition  should  not  be  seriously  affected  internationally.  U.S.  airlines  are  only 
half  the  story  for  international  markets.  Foreign  airlines  have  been  growing  faster, 
earning  greater  profits,  enjoying  better  customer  relations  and  in  some  cases  con-
solidating  more  than  U.S.  carriers.  U.S.  airlines  could  find  that  mergers  improve 
their  ability  to  compete  in  the  global  market  against  their  strengthening  foreign 
competitors. 

In summary, a wave of mergers could increase measures of concentration, but the 

industry should remain competitive at the national and international levels. 

Question  2.  Some  proponents  of  consolidation  in  the  aviation  industry  argue  that 
consolidation is necessary for air carriers to remain financially stable, deal with ris-
ing fuel costs, keep consumer prices relatively low, reduce duplicative capacity, and 
creating  stronger  route  structures  that  will  help  U.S.  carriers  better  compete  in  a 
global  market.  Do  you  think  you  could  explain  how  consolidation  in  this  case  will 
achieve  some  of  these  goals?  What  do  you  view  as  the  major  benefits  and  major 
drawbacks? 

Answer. The mergers being discussed almost always involve the six large network 
carriers.  Those  firms  are  under  enormous  competitive  pressure  from  the  low  cost 
carriers that continue to enjoy lower costs, high growth rates and more stable prof-
its.  The  low  cost  carriers  have  gained  significant  market  share  and  now  pressure 
prices  downward  for  3⁄4 of  all  U.S.  passengers.  Network  carriers  find  it  difficult  to 
compete  head-to-head  with  a  Southwest  Airlines  and  often  withdraw  in  the  face  of 
large  service  increases  by  them.  (See  for  example  U.S.  Airways’  situation  at  Pitts-
burgh  or  the  recent  withdrawal  of  network  airlines  from  Oakland.)  Consequently, 
network  airlines  are  looking  to  their  core  market  advantage—large  hub-and-spoke 
networks—to collect traffic. These networks are ideal for feeding international mar-
kets where low cost carriers have not yet ventured. 

Mergers  increase  the  scope  of  network  carrier  systems  and  give  them  a  greater 
ability to collect traffic both for domestic and international competition. This advan-
tage  is  needed  because  international  competitors  are  growing  through  their  own 
mergers (e.g., Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss) or higher market growth rates 
(e.g.,  Emirates  Air,  Singapore  Airlines,  Chinese  and  Indian  airlines).  The  benefits 
of  these  kinds  of  network  airline  mergers  are  that  they  could  make  U.S.  network 
airlines  bigger,  stronger  and  internationally  more  competitive.  The  primary  risks 
are  that  a  merger  proves  too  expensive  or  disruptive.  Another  threat  is  that  the 
international  markets  may  eventually  face  competition  from  U.S.  and  foreign  low 
cost  carriers  that  have  so  far  been  considered  unlikely  to  be  effective  competitors 
for  long-haul  international  routes.  That  may  not  necessarily  prove  to  be  correct  as 
international  markets  continue  to  deregulate  and  low  cost  carriers  look  for  new 
ways  to  enter  faster  growing  international  markets  either  through  partnerships  or 
new services of their own. 

Question 3. The U.S. airline industry has experienced a major transformation over 
the past decade. LCCs have grown to represent approximately a quarter of the Na-
tion’s  market  share,  up  from  about  15  percent  in  2000.  What  led  to  this  LCC  in-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

91 

crease  in  market  share?  What  impact  do  you  think  consolidation  will  have  on  LCC 
market  share  within  the  domestic  marketplace?  Will  it  be  easier  or  more  difficult 
for LCCs to grow in a consolidated industry? 

Answer.  LCC’s  have  grown  rapidly  since  2000  for  several  reasons.  First  their 
costs, and therefore their fares, are lower. Second, the Internet has given consumers 
a powerful tool for comparison shopping thereby pressuring fares downward. Third, 
the  dot.com  collapse  contributed  to  the  demise  of  a  large  portion  of  high-end  busi-
ness  fares  that  the  network  carriers  specialized  in  offering.  This  fare  collapse  has 
cost the network carriers at least $12 billion per year in lost revenue. Surprisingly, 
even  after  multiple  bankruptcy  reorganizations,  the  network  carriers  still  suffer 
from higher costs and that propels the increasing LCC market shares. 

Network airline mergers seem likely to provide LCC’s with more market opportu-
nities in the short to medium term as merged network carriers consolidate services. 
In  the  longer  run,  if  a  merger  is  successful  the  new  airline  should  be  a  more  effec-
tive  competitor  and  better  able  to  compete  with  LCC’s.  This  could  slow  the  steady 
stream  of  LCC  gains  in  market  shares  since  2000.  To  the  extent  LCC  managers 
have  commented  on  network  airline  mergers,  they  have  tended  to  favor  the  new 
market  opportunities  that  they  anticipate  being  created  for  them,  and  they  do  not 
seem overly concerned with the formation of larger competitors. 

Question 4. We are all aware of the poor quarterly financial reports that were re-
cently  announced  by  the  domestic  legacy  carriers.  What  do  you  attribute  the  cause 
to be? Has the industry fully felt the economic impact of the economic slowdown and 
the increased fuel prices? What are you expecting for the upcoming quarters for air-
lines? 

Answer. Airlines have historically been one of the least profitable and most cycli-
cal  of  all  industries.  The  current  weakening  economy  and  fuel  price  spike  have 
thrown the airlines from a profit position to a large loss situation. The airlines have 
been  unable  to  shrink  their  systems,  lower  their  costs  and  raise  fares  fast  enough 
to  remain  profitable.  I  anticipate  that  the  network  airlines  will  continue  to  cut  ca-
pacity and attempt to raise fares for the remainder of the year. The impact of these 
changes  will  be  felt  more  directly  beginning  in  the  fall  of  2008  when  the  already 
scheduled and already sold peak summer season is completed. The large airlines ap-
pear  to  have  enough  cash  to  carry  them  into  2009,  even  with  large  losses  for  2008. 
Whether  they  all  survive  2009,  or  several  liquidate  as  has  happened  in  earlier 
downturns, will be a function of fuel prices and the economy. Liquidation, of course, 
could result in industry consolidation without mergers. 

Question  5.  If  DOJ  is  to  approve  this  merger,  it  is  almost  certain  that  they  will 
require  divestiture  of  key  assets  as  a  condition  of  approving  the  consolidation  in 
order  to  ensure  viable  competition.  What  do  you  anticipate  as  being  necessary  or 
potential divestiture requirements resulting from this merger? Do the airlines have 
plans to divest under the current agreement? 

Answer.  I  anticipate  that  DOJ  will  have  few  divestiture  requirements  for  the 
Delta/Northwest  merger  because  the  two  carriers  do  no  compete  head-to-head  on 
many  routes.  The  merger  is  more  end-to-end  than  overlapping.  To  the  extent  DOJ 
requires remedies, those conditions usually revolve around the hub cities of the ap-
plicants. Delta and Northwest operate a combined total of seven hubs, and there are 
a few routes between those hubs where there are no nonstop competitors (e.g., Cin-
cinnati—Detroit  or  Minneapolis—Salt  Lake  City).  DOJ  might  want  to  ensure  that 
airport facilities are readily available to competitors on those routes. In addition, at 
some  hub  cities  low  cost  carriers  might  seek  DOJ’s  intervention  to  ensure  that  air-
port  facilities’  are  readily  available.  DOJ  can  be  expected  to  interview  competitors 
to  determine  if  any  intervention/divestiture  would  be  necessary  to  approve  the 
transaction. Such assets typically have been gates and slots at busy airports. 

Question 6. Will a consolidated aviation industry focus more heavily on their hubs 
for providing air service across the nation, or are there more plans to provide point- 
to-point service? 

Answer.  Network  carriers  appear  far  more  likely  to  focus  on  their  hubs,  either 
with  or  without  consolidation.  Competitive  and  macroeconomic  pressures  make  the 
advantages  of  hub  traffic  flow  more  important  than  ever.  Low  cost  carriers  should 
continue  to  be  significantly  less  focused  on  hub  systems,  although  not  completely 
independent of hubbing.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR TO 

PATRICK V. MURPHY, JR. 

Question. I am concerned that the DOJ will evaluate this merger in isolation and 
not  take  into  consideration  its  larger  effects  on  the  airline  industry  as  a  whole  and 
the  American  flying  public,  in  particular.  Should  Congress  consider  strengthening 
the  DOJ  airline  merger  review  process,  and  require  DOJ  to  consider  the  impact  of 
such mergers on employees, communities and the industry at-large? 

Answer. DOJ will review the Delta/Northwest merger in the context of a Sherman 
Act,  Clayton  Act,  and  Hart,  Scott  Rodino  Act  antitrust  review.  That  analysis  con-
siders  the  merger’s  impact  on  the  industry,  employees  and  the  public  primarily  as 
a  function  of  maintaining  a  competitive  market  structure.  Should  Congress  deter-
mine  that  a  broader  review  of  the  impact  of  airline  mergers  on  employees,  commu-
nities  and  the  industry  at  large  is  necessary,  that  role  would  not  be  optimally  per-
formed  in  the  DOJ  Antitrust  Division.  The  Department  of  Transportation  might  be 
better suited to conduct that broader public interest analysis as it does on an ongo-
ing  basis  for  numerous  airline  issues  and  as  it  did  for  5  years  before  all  airline 
merger functions shifted to DOJ in 1989. That broad public interest analysis of air-
line mergers by DOT from 1985 to 1989 was a vestige of airline economic regulation 
carried out for almost 40 years by the Civil Aeronautics Board. To some degree, once 
again  subjecting  the  airlines  to  a  special  merger  review  would  take  the  oversight 
of  the  industry  back  in  the  direction  of  economic  regulation  distinct  from  other  in-
dustries. There is no evidence that the public would be better served by such a pol-
icy shift, since deregulation of the airlines has generally been found to have greatly 
benefited  the  American  traveling  public.  Broad  public  interest  reviews  of  mergers 
would ultimately bring greater political and regional pressures on government deci-
sionmakers,  thereby  further  limiting  the  ability  of  airline  managers  to  restructure 
a  financially  weak  industry  that  is  already  handicapped  by  special  airline  invest-
ment laws that prohibit substantial cross-border investments or international merg-
ers. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

DOUGLAS M. STEENLAND 

Question 1. I would appreciate you providing me in writing details of current serv-
ice  for  Arkansas  passengers  on  your  airlines,  and  what  your  specific  plans  are  for 
the  future  service  for  Arkansas  passengers.  Some  things  I  am  concerned  about  in-
clude: Will the Memphis hub remain open? Are there plans to expand or reduce cur-
rent flight operations at Memphis? 

Answer. Currently, Memphis is a small but efficient and well-performing hub. We 
have  no  present  intention  of  dismantling  Memphis  or  any  other  hubs  as  a  result 
of the merger. We see the Delta/Northwest network as benefiting from its seven geo-
graphically balanced U.S. hubs. 

The  demand  for  air  travel  to  and  from  Memphis—which  has  sustained  a  major 
airline  hub  for  more  than  three  decades—is  not  going  to  disappear  simply  because 
there  is  a  neighboring  Delta  hub  330  miles  to  the  East  at  Atlanta.  Northwest’s 
Memphis  hub  has  existed  alongside  Delta’s  Atlanta  hub  since  its  inception,  and,  in 
and  of  itself,  the  merger  is  not  cause  for  its  elimination.  By  coordinating  and  opti-
mizing  schedules  across  the  complementary  multi-hub  network,  the  new  carrier 
should  be  able  to  improve  operating  results  and  offer  greater  frequency  and  better 
routing  choices  for  its  customers.  Memphis  provides  an  important  opportunity  for 
future growth when economic circumstances permit. Even with its fifth runway, At-
lanta  is  operating  at  or  near  capacity.  Memphis  is  a  flexible  and  less  congested  al-
ternative hub. 

That said, no one can predict the future price of oil and consumer demand, which 
will impact the service levels and operations of all carriers irrespective of the merg-
er.  When  the  Delta-Northwest  merger  was  announced  on  April  14,  oil  was  at  $112 
barrel.  Today,  oil  is  at  $143,  an  over  $1  billion  annual  cost  increase  to  Northwest 
alone.  We  do  think  that  the  merger  provides  the  best  opportunity  for  Delta  and 
Northwest  to  preserve  and  expand  on  their  hub  infrastructure  investments  by  gen-
erating additional traffic flows throughout the broader combined network. 

Another key consideration in maintaining our hub at Memphis is the business re-
lationships  and  important  corporate  customers  we  have  developed.  FedEx  is 
headquartered  in  Memphis  and  is  one  of  Northwest’s  top  five  customers  in  the 
world.  We  carry  their  sales  people,  their  executives,  their  pilots,  and  other  of  their 
employees  throughout  our  global  network.  The  existence  of  Northwest’s  hub  in 
Memphis actually has helped FedEx to grow and to expand. And, they have helped 
us by sharing costs at the airport, which makes the Memphis airport a very attrac-

tive  place  for  us  to  do  business.  FedEx  is  a  critical  customer  and  a  great  partner 
of  Northwest.  And  they’ll  be  a  great  partner  of  the  merged  airline  going  forward. 
Simply stated, the combined carrier has strong incentives to maintain service at all 
of the hubs. 

Question 1a. Will access to all current hubs currently served by Delta and North-
west  from  Little  Rock  National,  Northwest  Arkansas  Regional,  and  Fort  Smith  Re-
gional remain available? 

Answer. We expect Arkansas customers and the airports you have noted to benefit 
from  the  merger  because  the  combined  carrier  can  provide  better  service  to  cus-
tomers  across  a  broader,  world-wide  network.  The  new  carrier’s  pattern  of  service 
will be optimized to provide the best and most efficient connecting opportunities, as 
well  as  serving  hubs  that  have  significant  local  market  demand.  Today’s  schedule 
from  the  spoke  cities  in  Arkansas  to  Delta’s  hubs  and  Northwest’s  hubs  is  what  is 
optimal  for  each  carrier  operating  separately.  Once  the  merger  takes  place,  a  com-
bined  schedule  will  be  developed  that  optimizes  for  the  entire  combined  network, 
so changes will take place. 

Question 1b. Will the same frequencies of flights continue? Will the same number 

of seats from and into each airport remain available? 

Answer.  In  the  face  of  staggering  fuel  prices  and  a  slowing  economy,  the  entire 
domestic  airline  industry  is  shrinking.  However,  a  combined  Delta  and  Northwest 
will be much better able to meet these challenges and mitigate against loss of flights 
and jobs that are afflicting the industry as a whole. For example, last month United 
announced that it will reduce its mainline fleet by 100 aircraft and cut domestic ca-
pacity by 17 percent. Continental will retire 67 mainline aircraft and reduce domes-
tic capacity by 11 percent. American will retire at least 75 aircraft and cut domestic 
mainline capacity by 12 percent. 

We  expect  the  merger  will  enable  Delta  and  Northwest  to  preserve  more  service 
and  capacity  together  than  would  be  possible  by  either  carrier  on  a  stand-alone 
basis. Together, Northwest and Delta can make more efficient use of their resources. 
However, with fuel prices continuing to climb, no one can predict whether the num-
ber of frequencies and seats will remain the same at any given airport. 

As noted above, today’s schedule from the spoke cities in Arkansas to Delta’s hubs 
and Northwest’s hubs is what is optimal for each carrier operating separately. Once 
the  merger  takes  place,  a  combined  schedule  will  be  developed  that  optimizes  for 
the entire combined network, so changes will take place. 

Question  1c.  Can  consumers  count  on  adequate  service  at  airports?  How  many 

cuts to employees at our airports will you make? 

Answer.  The  Arkansas  airports  are  important  to  the  new  carrier’s  network  and 
customers  will  have  access  to  an  improved  global  single  carrier  network.  However, 
the  level  of  service  is  subject  to  the  economic  fundamentals  of  supply  and  demand. 
Fuel  prices  continue  to  wreak  havoc  on  the  airlines,  and  all  major  legacy  carriers 
have  had  to  cut  back  on  capacity,  because  fewer  people  want  to  fly  at  the  higher 
prices  that  are  necessary  to  cover  today’s  increased  costs.  The  merger  better  posi-
tions Northwest and Delta to remain a strong and viable carrier in the face of $143/ 
bbl oil and a $30 crack spread. 

Northwest  currently  employs  about  40  people  in  Arkansas,  and  Delta  about  90. 
While some overall reduction in force will occur, it is too early to specify the precise 
number. 

Question 1d. Will prices be reasonable and competitive? Who will be your competi-

tors in these airports? 

Answer. All Arkansas airports will have competitive air service at fair and reason-
able prices, taking into account the cost pressures facing the airline industry today. 
It  is  inevitable,  however,  that  the  increased  price  of  fuel  must  be  reflected  in  air 
fares. Our desire is to develop a sustainable, dependable carrier that is less vulner-
able  to  the  boom-and-bust  cycle  that  has  typified  the  industry.  This  is  in  the  best 
interest of our customers, employees, and the communities that depend on our serv-
ices. We don’t know our competitors plans for future service; we do know that they 
are  feeling  the  impact  of  exorbitant  and  unexpected  fuel  price  increases.  Based  on 
published  schedules,  the  following  are  the  competitors  at  the  three  Arkansas  air-
ports—— 

Little  Rock  is  served  by  every  major  legacy  carrier,  plus  Southwest  Airlines,  the 
largest U.S. domestic carrier, which is know for its LCC (Low Cost Carrier) business 
model.  Specifically,  the  carriers  at  Little  Rock  are:  American,  Continental,  Delta, 
Northwest, Southwest, United and U.S. Airways. 

Northwest  Arkansas  Regional  is  served  by  American,  Continental,  Delta,  North-

west, United, and U.S. Airways.

Fort  Smith  is  served  by  American,  Delta,  and  Northwest.  Notably,  Delta  began 
service to Fort Smith just last year with regional jet service to Atlanta. Fort Smith 
will continue to have competitive service by American. 

The domestic U.S. airline business is highly competitive and expected to stay that 

way. 

Question 1e. What metrics do you use to determine comparative hub performance 

and will you please provide me with your latest hub performance data? 

Answer.  Comparative  hub  performance  is  measured  by  the  P&L  of  the  various 
hubs.  This  is  confidential,  proprietary,  and  competitively  sensitive  data.  However, 
as noted above, we consider MEM to be an efficient and well-performing hub. 

Question  1f.  Can  you  provide  revenue  per  passenger  miles  data  for  flights  origi-
nating  in  Little  Rock  National,  Northwest  Arkansas  Regional,  Fort  Smith  Regional 
Airport? 

Answer.  The  table  below  contains  outbound  revenue  passenger  miles  for  flights 
operated by Northwest and its regional affiliates, for the year ended February 2008, 
from each of the three airports: 

Fort Smith 
Little Rock 
Northwest Arkansas 

6,243,924 
31,675,102 
28,839,570 

Question 1g. Can you please provide me with current yields in the Little Rock Na-
tional,  Northwest  Arkansas  Regional,  Fort  Smith  Regional  markets?  How  do  those 
yields compare to other similarly situation markets? 

Answer.  The  yields  the  three  Arkansas  airports  are  comparable  to  those  in  simi-
larly  situated  markets.  Below  are  the  current  yields  for  each  of  the  three  subject 
airports, together with representative counterparts, based on 4th Quarter 2007 DOT

Question 2. While one of the main arguments you make in support of your merger 
is  a  lack  of  route  overlap,  I  see  many  NWA/DAL  hub  or  ‘‘connection’’  overlap  con-
cerns for Arkansans traveling from Arkansas to destinations in the eastern U.S. and 
other regions of the country. For instance, when I travel from Little Rock to Wash-
ington, I traditionally look at both Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines to compare 
schedules  and  prices  (that  is  because  they  are  the  most  sensible  connections,  and 
currently  they  offer  many  options).  Under  a  merged  airline,  I  will  essentially  only 
be  looking  at  one  airline.  I  am  concerned  that  the  connection  competition  in  this 
case will likely be reduced or eliminated under a single airline. How can you assure 
me  that  this  will  not  occur?  How  can  you  guarantee  the  current  competition  that 
exists  will  continue  and  prices  will  remain  competitive  in  these  types  of  instances? 
Answer. The industry will continue to have competition from a host of legacy and 
LCC  carriers  in  both  nonstop  and  connecting  markets.  Due  to  skyrocketing  fuel 
prices  which  carriers  must  pass  on  to  customers  to  cover  their  costs,  air  fares  have 
increased  in  markets  nationwide.  However,  the  industry  will  remain  competitive 
and there is no reason to conclude that fares will increase as a result of the merger. 
Post  merger,  no  carrier  will  have  greater  than  20  percent  domestic  market  share. 
Southwest is and will remain the largest U.S. domestic carrier. 

Based  on  published  schedules,  it  is  clear  that  service  between  Little  Rock  and 
Washington  will  remain  competitive  after  the  merger.  Indeed,  today  Southwest  op-
erates  nonstop  service  between  Little  Rock  and  BWI.  U.S.  Airways  offers  one-stop 
service  via  Charlotte  to  all  three  Washington  Airports,  and  American  serves  Wash-
ington Reagan and BWI via O’Hare. Furthermore, in addition to serving Little Rock

itself,  Southwest  operates  substantial  regional  connecting  complexes  at  Nashville, 
St. Louis, and Birmingham. 

There is ample competition in the Little Rock-Washington market, and other simi-

lar city-pairs serviced by Delta and Northwest on a connecting basis. 

Question 2a. What is the current status of your discussions with flight attendants, 

machinists, other administrative employees and ‘‘front-line’’ employees? 

Answer. We are pleased that the NW–ALPA pilot leadership, together with Delta 
management and DALPA, were able to reach a tentative agreement this month con-
cerning  a  labor  contract.  Because  there  are  no  common  unions  (like  ALPA)  within 
the other employee groups, Delta must await the results of the representation elec-
tions  after  the  close  of  the  merger  to  commence  discussions  with  other  employee 
groups. 

Question  3.  I  understand  that  you  estimate  savings  of  a  merged  airline  to  be  ap-
proximately $1 billion. I assume you will attain some of these savings through both 
revenue  increases  and  cost  reductions.  Could  you  be  more  specific  as  to  where  you 
anticipate having new revenue under the merger and where you anticipate reducing 
costs through such a merger? 

Answer. The synergies we project are as follows: 

Revenue Benefits 
First,  by  having  access  to  a  larger  inventory  of  aircraft,  we  will  create  a  bal-
anced  and  more  flexible  fleet  and  be  able  to  better  match  capacity  to  demand. 
For  example,  we  fly  a  747  with  403  seats  from  Minneapolis/St.  Paul  to  Tokyo, 
whereas Delta flies a 275 seat 777 from their much larger hub at Atlanta. Both 
cities can sustain nonstop service, but it may make more sense to fly the larger 
aircraft at the larger hub. Delta has no aircraft over 285 seats; whereas North-
west  has  37  planes  in  this  category.  In  addition,  Delta  has  no  aircraft  in  the 
100 seat range, where Northwest’s DC–9s have 100–125 seats. This provides an 
opportunity  to  upgauge  some  regional  jet  routes  to  larger,  more  efficient  air-
craft.  All  together,  we  estimate  that  the  fleet  optimization  benefits  will  total 
$400–$500 million. 
Second,  we  will  offer  customers  a  better  and  more  attractive  network.  We  will 
have  the  best  frequent  flyer  program  in  the  industry  and  will  also  be  able  to 
compete  more  effectively  for  corporate  contracts.  The  expanded  schedule  and 
marketing benefits created by bringing the two airlines together are anticipated 
to attract $200–$300 million in additional revenue. 
Lower Costs 
We  also  expect  to  realize  substantial  savings  on  the  cost  side.  We  have  identi-
fied  more  than  $700  million  in  annual  cost  synergies  that  can  be  realized  from 
moving  to  a  common  information  technology  platform,  reducing  sales  and  dis-
tribution  costs,  improving  productivity,  and  reducing  duplicative  facilities  and 
overhead. 
Total Synergies 
The  $700–800  million  in  revenue  benefits  along  with  $700  million  in  cost 
synergies produces over $1 billion in annual synergies. 

Question 4. Domestic airlines have reduced their total labor costs by about 13 per-
cent from 2000 through 2006 while also increasing employee productivity. Could you 
please  discuss  how  your  airlines  achieved  some  of  these  efficiencies?  Could  you 
please  explain  how  the  merged  airline  will  achieve  additional  efficiencies?  Do  you 
anticipate consumers to benefit from these reduced services and expenditures? 

Answer.  Northwest’s  restructuring,  completed  in  2007,  achieved  substantial  an-
nual cost reductions, including: $1.4 billion in labor cost reductions, $400 million in 
annual fleet ownership cost savings and a $150 million reduction in annual interest 
expense  related  to  unsecured  debt.  Unfortunately,  these  important  efficiency 
achievements—and  employee  sacrifices—have  been  largely  consumed  by  sky-
rocketing  fuel  prices.  In  2003,  17  cents  of  every  passenger  dollar  went  to  fuel. 
Today, fuel consumes over 40 percent of every revenue dollar. 

As  detailed  above,  the  merger  creates  cost  and  revenue  synergies  valued  at  more 
than  $1  billion.  The  success  of  the  merger  depends  on  using  our  aircraft  and  hubs 
more  efficiently,  attracting  additional  customers,  and  lowering  costs.  Hub-andspoke 
systems  depend  on  collecting  traffic  from  across  a  broad  network  and  taking  pas-
sengers  where  they  want  to  go.  Together,  Northwest  and  Delta  can  offer  their  cus-
tomers  a  better  and  more  efficient  network  through  the  end-to-end  combination  of 
complementary hubs.

Question  5.  It  is  my  understanding  that  fuel  costs  now  exceed  labor  as  the  pri-
mary  cost  for  air  carriers.  It  is  also  my  understanding  that  air  carriers  are  paying 
more  than  $140  per  barrel  due  to  refinery  issues  to  produce  jet  fuel.  On  an  inter-
national  route  competitive  stage  are  U.S.  carriers  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  to 
foreign international carriers due to oil prices (value of dollar)? 

Answer. European carriers, which receive the bulk of their revenues in Euros are 
paying for oil in stronger currency, whereas U.S. carriers are paying in weaker dol-
lars. 

Question 5a. What measures are you currently taking to counter recent spikes in 
fuel prices (luggage fees, seat preference fees, etc.)? What are you doing to increase 
fuel efficiencies in aircraft? 

Answer. Northwest is trying to price its services to recoup as much of its expenses 
as possible. In 2008, U.S. airlines are forecast to spend $61.2 billion on jet fuel, $20 
billion more than in 2007, and are projected to incur losses totaling close to $10 bil-
lion.  If  the  current  pricing  dynamic  does  not  change,  our  industry  will  be  severely 
challenged and will continue shrinking. There have been a number of rounds of gen-
eral  fare  increases,  as  well  as  additional  service  fees  imposed  for  consumer  discre-
tionary items such as checked baggage. At the moment, Northwest charges some do-
mestic  customers  $25  for  the  second  checked  bag,  but  does  not  charge  for  the  first 
bag.  Moreover,  Northwest  has  announced  that  it  will  be  8.5–9.5  percent  smaller  in 
Q4 2008 versus Q4 2007. 

Since  2000,  Northwest  has  reduced  its  annual  fuel  usage  by  575  million  gallons 
(while  also  reducing  CO2 emissions  by  5.5  million  metric  tons).  NWA  has  accom-
plished  this  substantial  improvement  in  fuel  efficiency  through  a  number  of  dif-
ferent  initiatives,  the  cornerstone  of  which  is  our  $6  billion  fleet  renewal  program. 
Northwest  operates  thirty-two  (32)  Airbus  330s.  The  A330s  are  approximately  30 
percent  more  fuel  efficient  than  the  similarly-sized  McDonnell  Douglas  DC–10s, 
which  were  retired  from  the  NWA  fleet  in  2007.  In  2007,  Northwest  ordered  sev-
enty-two (72) new regional jets. These 76-seat aircraft are approximately 30 percent 
more  fuel  efficient  than  the  similarly-sized  McDonnell  Douglas  DC–9.  Since  2003, 
NWA  has  operated  a  fleet  of  over  one-hundred  and  thirty  (130)  Airbus  A319s  and 
A320s.  The  A319s  and  A320s  replaced  the  less  fuel  efficient  Boeing  727–200s  and 
DC–9s  and  are  30  percent  more  fuel  efficient.  In  2007,  the  average  fuel  efficiency 
of Northwest’s fleet was fifty-three (53) passenger-miles per gallon. 

NWA is the North American launch customer for the new Boeing 787. We antici-
pate  delivery  of  eighteen  787  aircraft  beginning  in  2009,  thereby  replacing  some  of 
NWA’s  Boeing  747–400s.  The  787s  are  anticipated  to  perform  with  a  greater  than 
20 percent fuel efficiency improvement over the 747–400s. 

NWA  has  also  instituted  a  number  of  fuel-savings  initiatives  where  operationally 

feasible including: 

• single engine taxiing and no engine taxiing (high speed tractor towing); 
• engine washing; 
• conversion from mobile to stationary fueling vehicles; 
• addition of aircraft winglets; 
• adjusting aircraft speed and altitude; and 
• removal of excess weight from planes. 
According  to  2007  DOT  data,  Northwest  ranks  second  among  U.S.  network  car-

riers in terms of revenue passenger miles per gallon: 

Question  5b.  What  would  a  combined  Delta/Northwest  plan  for  dealing  with  high 

fuel prices look like? 

Answer. Delta and Northwest cannot change the price they pay for fuel. However, 
as explained above, the combined carrier will realize over $1 billion in cost and rev-
enue benefits. The stronger and financially more resilient carrier will be better able 
to cope with the challenges of high fuel prices.

Question 6. I note that without a merger, you believe you may be at a competitive 
disadvantage to other foreign carriers in international carriers under the upcoming, 
new  ‘‘Open  Skies’’  agreement  between  the  United  States  and  European  Union. 
Could you explain these disadvantages and why a merger will benefit you and con-
sumers on international service? What are the benefits and drawbacks of the agree-
ment? 

Answer.  European  carriers  are  stronger  and  better  financed.  For  example,  the 
current market capitalization of Lufthansa is greater than that of all the U.S. legacy 
carriers combined. Moreover, as noted above, European carriers enjoy a cost advan-
tage in paying for fuel in Euros versus dollars. Northwest and Delta need to be able 
to  meet  this  growing  foreign  flag  challenge  by  combining  into  a  stronger  and  more 
robust international carrier. 

7. What is the current state of your aircraft fleets as far as age and fuel economy? 
What  does  the  merged  airline  plan  on  doing  with  aging  aircraft  and  less  efficient 
aircraft in your fleet?

The  fuel  economy  of  the  Northwest/Northwest  Airlink  fleet  with  respect  to  rev-
enue passenger miles and available seat miles (based on 2007 DOT data) is set forth 
in the following table: 

The  merged  company  would  seek  to  optimize  fuel  efficiency  of  the  combined  fleet 
by  matching  capacity  to  demand,  and  using  the  largest  and  most  fuel  efficient  air-
craft  practical  for  a  given  market.  For  aircraft  of  a  given  size  class,  the  oldest  and 
least fuel efficient will be considered for retirement, subject to the capacity require-
ments  of  the  network.  The  combined  company  also  hopes  to  invest  in  newer,  more 
fuel efficient aircraft, including up to 20 new Boeing widebody jets, as permitted by 
economic circumstances.

noted that the combined carrier intends to keep ‘‘executive offices’’ in the Twin Cit-
ies. But you also indicated at both the House and Senate Judiciary Committee hear-
ings in April 2008 that there would be job cuts—of around 1,000 employees—at both 
Delta’s  Atlanta  headquarters  as  well  as  Northwest’s  Eagan  headquarters?  Of  the 
approximately  1100  employees  who  work  in  the  Eagan  headquarters,  how  many  of 
these employees will lose their jobs? 

Answer. The number of jobs that will remain in Eagan has not been determined. 
Question  1a.  Do  you  plan  to  eliminate  these  headquarters  jobs  through  natural 

attrition, or do you plan to actually layoff employees? 

Answer.  There  will  be  natural  attrition,  retirements  and  potentially  other  oppor-
tunities in the system. There will likely be layoffs associated with headquarters jobs. 
Question 1b. Will you offer any of these Eagan headquarters-based employees who 
are  slated  to  be  laid-off  the  opportunity  to  move  to  Atlanta  or  will  these  jobs  be 
eliminated outright? 

Answer. Some employees will be offered the opportunity to move to Atlanta, some 
will  be  asked  to  continue  with  the  merged  carrier  in  Minnesota,  and  some  will  not 
have an opportunity with the merged airline. 

Question  1c.  In  an  effort  to  streamline  the  combined  carriers’  headquarters  oper-

ations, will you offer the effected employees voluntary ‘‘buy out’’ packages? 

Answer.  Severance  packages  will  be  offered  to  employees  who  do  not  have  a  job 

opportunity with the merged airline. 

Question 2. At the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee hearing in April 2008, I asked 
about  the  ‘‘staying  power’’  of  the  combined  carriers’  commitments  to  maintain  jobs, 
service  and  hubs.  Mr.  Anderson’s  response  was:  ‘‘The  issue  is  going  to  be  fuel.  Tell 
me where fuel will be.’’ What if the cost of jet fuel remains around where it is today? 
Are  your  commitments  premised  on  the  current  environment  of  high  fuel  prices  or 
are your commitments—to maintain jobs, service and hubs—based on a more favor-
able fuel environment? 

Answer. Under any scenario, Delta and Northwest will be more resilient and bet-
ter able to maintain jobs, services, and hubs together, as a combined company, than 
they  can  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  On  the  date  of  our  merger  hearing  on  April  24, 
oil  was  at  $116  per  barrel.  As  of  July  1,  oil  stood  at  over  $140—$24  more.  Each 
$10 per barrel increase adds $420 million to Northwest’s annual costs—over $1 bil-
lion  since  April.  So,  today,  we  can’t  do  as  much  flying  as  we  thought  we  could  in 
April.  It  is  imperative  that  the  merger  be  approved  and  approved  quickly  so  that 
we can realize the benefits and efficiencies and mitigate against the challenges that 
are afflicting the industry. 

In  the  time  since  the  hearing  in  April,  all  six  U.S.  network  carriers  have  an-
nounced  significant  capacity  cuts  and  service  reductions,  as  well  as  difficult 
headcount  reductions,  to  take  effect  after  the  summer  travel  season.  American  Air-
lines  intends  to  reduce  fourth  quarter  domestic  capacity  11–12  percent,  retire  at 
least 75 mainline and regional aircraft and may eliminate thousands of jobs. United 
Airlines  said  it  will  ground  at  least  100  airplanes  and  is  looking  at  shrinking  staff 
including 950 pilots. Delta is reducing domestic capacity by 13 percent in the second 
half of 2008, eliminating 4,000 positions and shedding aircraft. Continental Airlines 
announced  that  it  would  reduce  fourth  quarter  domestic  mainline  capacity  by  11 
percent,  will  eliminate  44  routes  and  cut  3,000  jobs.  U.S.  Airways  will  shrink  do-
mestic  capacity  in  the  fourth  quarter  by  6–8  percent.  Northwest  plans  to  reduce 
fourth quarter capacity by 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

RICHARD H. ANDERSON 

Question 1. I would appreciate you providing me in writing details of current serv-
ice  for  Arkansas  passengers  on  your  airlines,  and  what  your  specific  plans  are  for 
the  future  service  for  Arkansas  passengers.  Some  things  I  am  concerned  about  in-
clude: Will the Memphis hub remain open? Are there plans to expand or reduce cur-
rent flight operations at Memphis? 

Answer.  Yes,  the  Memphis  hub  will  remain  open  and  an  important  part  of  the 
new Delta’s network. The Delta/Northwest network formed by our seven geographi-
cally balanced U.S. hubs is the combined carrier’s greatest asset. We have no inten-
tion  of  dismantling  any  hubs  as  a  result  of  the  merger,  and  have  committed  to 
maintaining  Atlanta,  Cincinnati,  Detroit,  Memphis,  Minneapolis/St.  Paul,  New 
York-JFK,  and  Salt  Lake  City.  These  hubs  exist  because  there  was  a  strong  local 
market  that  justified  the  development  of  hub  service,  and  an  air  carrier  with  the 
resources  to  develop  it.  Delta  and  Northwest  made  different—but  sound—business

99 

decisions in developing hubs in the cities where they exist today. Furthermore, each 
hub has unique service points, which add value to the hub and to the network. The 
merger  provides  the  opportunity  for  Delta  and  Northwest  to  make  better  use  of 
their hub infrastructure investments by generating additional traffic flows through-
out  the  broader  combined  network.  Because  this  is  an  end-to-end  merger  and  be-
cause  sound  economics  underlie  our  hub  operations  today,  there  is  no  need  for  hub 
closures as a result of the merger. Memphis will continue to play an important role 
for  the  combined  carrier,  as  will  both  the  Cincinnati-Northern  Kentucky  Inter-
national and Detroit Airports. 

Question 1a. Will access to all current hubs currently served by Delta and North-
west  from  Little  Rock  National,  Northwest  Arkansas  Regional,  and  Fort  Smith  Re-
gional remain available? 

Answer.  The  combined  carrier  will  not  eliminate  service  to  any  city  in  Arkansas 
as  a  result  of  the  merger.  While  there  may  be  some  adjustments  to  frequency  and 
equipment (capacity) in certain markets, we believe the overall effect of the merger 
will be favorable relative to service levels in Arkansas. There may well be some re-
ductions in service as a result of the meteoric rise in fuel prices but those decisions 
are  unrelated  to  the  specific  effects  of  this  merger.  It  is  our  hope  that  we  will  be 
able  to  increase  service  to  Arkansas  communities  in  the  future  as  we  connect  the 
two networks to take advantage of the growth and revenue synergies that we expect 
from this merger. 

Question 1b. Will the same frequencies of flights continue? Will the same number 

of seats from and into each airport remain available? 

Answer.  While  there  may  be  some  adjustments  to  frequency  and  equipment  (ca-
pacity) in certain markets, we believe the overall effect of the merger will be favor-
able  relative  to  service  levels  in  Arkansas  as  the  combination  of  Delta  and  North-
west will create a stronger company with route systems that complement each other 
and  provide  opportunities  to  offer  travelers  a  global  network  that  neither  airline 
could offer independently. There may well be some reductions in service as a result 
of  the  meteoric  rise  in  fuel  prices  but  those  decisions  are  unrelated  to  the  specific 
effects of this merger. 

Question  1c.  Can  consumers  count  on  adequate  service  at  airports?  How  many 

cuts to employees at our airports will you make? 

Answer.  We  believe  the  overall  effect  of  the  merger  will  be  favorable  relative  to 
service levels in Arkansas, and we do not plan to eliminate any front-line employee 
positions  as  a  result  of  the  merger.  As  a  result  of  the  meteoric  increase  in  the  cost 
of fuel, we have announced a voluntary early-out and early-retirement program that 
we anticipate will result in a reduction of approximately 3,000 employees across the 
entire  Delta  system,  both  front-line  and  administrative/management  positions.  Any 
additional changes to our employee counts will result from fuel-cost driven changes 
to service levels, not the merger. 

Question 1d. Will prices be reasonable and competitive? Who will be your competi-

tors in these airports? 

Answer.  We  believe  the  overall  effect  of  the  merger  will  be  favorable  relative  to 
service  levels  in  Arkansas,  permitting  the  combined  company  to  offer  customers 
greater choice, more competitive fares, and a superior travel experience. Of the more 
than  800  domestic  non-stop  routes  that  NW  and  DL  collectively  fly,  there  are  only 
12  non-stop  city-pair  overlaps.  The  vast  majority  of  these  non-stop  overlaps  enjoy 
substantial competition from other carriers, and all consumers will benefit from the 
significant  cost  savings  that  the  transaction  will  create.  Little  Rock  is  served  by 
every  major  legacy  carrier,  plus  Southwest  Airlines,  the  largest  U.S.  domestic  car-
rier, which is know for its LCC (Low Cost Carrier) business model. Specifically, the 
carriers  at  Little  Rock  are:  American,  Continental,  Delta,  Northwest,  Southwest, 
United  and  U.S.  Airways.  Northwest  Arkansas  Regional  is  served  by  American, 
Continental,  Delta,  Northwest,  United,  and  U.S.  Airways.  Fort  Smith  is  served  by 
American,  Delta,  and  Northwest.  Notably,  Delta  began  service  to  Fort  Smith  just 
last year with regional jet service to Atlanta. Fort Smith will likely continue to have 
competitive service by American. 

Question 1e. What metrics do you use to determine comparative hub performance 

and will you please provide me with your latest hub performance data? 

Answer.  Comparative  hub  performance  is  measured  by  profit  and  loss  at  each 

hub. We believe hubs in the Delta system to be performing very well. 

Question  1f.  Can  you  provide  revenue  per  passenger  miles  data  for  flights  origi-
nating  in  Little  Rock  National,  Northwest  Arkansas  Regional,  Fort  Smith  Regional 
Airport?

culation overview. 

Question 2. While one of the main arguments you make in support of your merger 
is  a  lack  of  route  overlap,  I  see  many  NWA/DAL  hub  or  ‘‘connection’’  overlap  con-
cerns for Arkansans traveling from Arkansas to destinations in the eastern U.S. and 
other regions of the country. For instance, when I travel from Little Rock to Wash-
ington, I traditionally look at both Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines to compare 
schedules  and  prices  (that  is  because  they  are  the  most  sensible  connections,  and 
currently  they  offer  many  options).  Under  a  merged  airline,  I  will  essentially  only 
be  looking  at  one  airline.  I  am  concerned  that  the  connection  competition  in  this 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

101 

case will likely be reduced or eliminated under a single airline. How can you assure 
me  that  this  will  not  occur?  How  can  you  guarantee  the  current  competition  that 
exists  will  continue  and  prices  will  remain  competitive  in  these  types  of  instances? 
Answer.  Since  Delta  and  Northwest  have  focused  their  attention  on  different  re-
gions,  there  are  few  overlap  routes  and  customers  will  gain  the  benefits  of  a  larger 
combined  network  without  any  material  reduction  in  services.  Similarly,  on  con-
necting  route  overlaps,  potential  competitive  effects  are  mitigated  by  the  presence 
of low cost carriers, the relatively small market shares of Delta and Northwest, the 
availability  of  alternative  airports  and  the  likelihood  that  legacy  carriers  will  ex-
pand  into  these  markets.  In  addition,  the  transaction  will  generate  significant  effi-
ciencies  through  such  factors  as  more  efficient  matching  of  aircraft  to  routes  that 
will enable the combined carrier to be financially stable and to offer a better product 
to customers, such as a broad global network and enhanced airport presence. 

Question 2a. What is the current status of your discussions with flight attendants, 

machinists, other administrative employees and ‘‘front-line’’ employees? 

Answer. Delta and Northwest took the unprecedented step early on in our merger 
discussions of asking the two pilot groups, who were represented by the same union, 
to  try  to  reach  agreement  on  a  common  contract  and  operational  integration  plan 
before the merger transaction was completed. The two pilot groups have undertaken 
discussions to reach agreement on those issues. Upon completion of the merger, the 
status of the union representation of the various Delta work groups, along with the 
status  of  the  various  Northwest  groups,  will  be  resolved  through  a  fair  and  equi-
table process under procedures administered by the National Mediation Board based 
on the requirements of the Railway Labor Act. 

Question  3.  I  understand  that  you  estimate  savings  of  a  merged  airline  to  be  ap-
proximately $1 billion. I assume you will attain some of these savings through both 
revenue  increases  and  cost  reductions.  Could  you  be  more  specific  as  to  where  you 
anticipate having new revenue under the merger and where you anticipate reducing 
costs through such a merger? 

Answer.  The  $1  billion  in  benefits  is  derived  from  separate  costs  and  revenue 
synergies.  The  revenue  benefits  are  created  by  expanded  schedule  opportunities, 
broader  networks  and  an  expanded  fleet  that  better  optimizes  capacity  to  demand. 
These benefits are estimated at $700–$800 million. The cost synergies are also esti-
mated  at  $700  million  and  are  attained  from  common  information  technology  plat-
forms,  reduced  overhead,  improved  productivity  and  efficiencies  gained  from  in-
creased scale. 

Question 4. Domestic airlines have reduced their total labor costs by about 13 per-
cent from 2000 through 2006 while also increasing employee productivity. Could you 
please  discuss  how  your  airlines  achieved  some  of  these  efficiencies?  Could  you 
please  explain  how  the  merged  airline  will  achieve  additional  efficiencies?  Do  you 
anticipate consumers to benefit from these reduced services and expenditures? 

Answer.  Employees  in  the  airline  industry  have  sacrificed  time  and  time  again. 
The dramatic rise in fuel costs has resulted in much of the cost savings our employ-
ees  have  generated  through  productivity  improvements  and  benefit  losses  being 
used to pay for fuel rather than to improve the product. In effect, it has eroded most 
of  the  sacrifices  they  have  made  to  make  their  company  viable  and  sustainable  in 
the future. Merging Delta and Northwest will create a much more financially stable 
company  with  approximately  $7  billion  in  liquidity  and  $1  billion  in  annual 
synergies.  The  combined  airline  will  be  able  to  withstand  an  80  percent  greater  in-
crease  in  fuel  price  than  either  airline  standing  alone,  and  still  maintain  profit-
ability.  This  financial  strength  and  flexibility,  much  greater  than  either  airline 
standing alone, will provide additional resources to help weather this unprecedented 
fuel  cost  environment  and  a  softening  domestic  market,  and  equip  us  better  to  in-
vest back in our people, our fleet and our customers. 

Question  5.  It  is  my  understanding  that  fuel  costs  now  exceed  labor  as  the  pri-
mary  cost  for  air  carriers.  It  is  also  my  understanding  that  air  carriers  are  paying 
more  than  $140  per  barrel  due  to  refinery  issues  to  produce  jet  fuel.  On  an  inter-
national  route  competitive  stage  are  U.S.  carriers  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  to 
foreign international carriers due to oil prices (value of dollar)? 

Answer. Because of the relative weakness of the dollar, U.S. Carriers pay between 

$55 and $63 more per gallon of jet fuel than most of our European competitors. 

Question 5a. What measures are you currently taking to counter recent spikes in 
fuel prices (luggage fees, seat preference fees, etc.)? What are you doing to increase 
fuel efficiencies in aircraft? 

Answer.  Delta  has  responded  to  the  meteoric  rise  in  the  price  of  fuel  by,  among 
other  measures,  reducing  approximately  10  percent  of  our  domestic  capacity,  offer-
ing an early retirement or early-out package we anticipate approximately 3,000 em-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  11:21 Apr 25, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80523.TXT JACKIE

102 

ployees (front-line and management/administrative) will elect to take, and initiating 
certain  new  fees  related  to  the  cost  of  providing  commercial  air  service.  We  have 
been  improving  our  fuel  efficiency  steadily  over  the  last  few  years  with  initiatives 
like developing satellite based approach and departure procedures single-engine taxi 
in  Atlanta,  procedures  to  reduce  fuel  consumption  on  the  ground,  repositioning  of 
aircraft  with  ground  equipment,  a  cabin  refurbishment  program  that  reduces 
weight, and adding blended winglets to more than 60 aircraft. 

Question  5b.  What  would  a  combined  Delta/Northwest  plan  for  dealing  with  high 

fuel prices look like? 

Answer. The merged carrier will see a much stronger balance sheet resulting from 
revenue  and  cost  synergies  that  should  enable  us  to  withstand  additional  increases 
in the cost of fuel. 

Question 6. I note that without a merger, you believe you may be at a competitive 
disadvantage to other foreign carriers in international carriers under the upcoming, 
new  ‘‘Open  Skies’’  agreement  between  the  United  States  and  European  Union. 
Could you explain these disadvantages and why a merger will benefit you and con-
sumers on international service? What are the benefits and drawbacks of the agree-
ment? 

Answer.  Today  foreign  flag  carriers  carry  more  passengers  to  and  from  the  U.S., 
Europe  and  Asia  than  U.S.  flag  carriers.  They  are  frequently  funded  by  their  gov-
ernments  and  benefit  from  regulatory  policies  that  promote  consolidation  into  a 
handful of strong competitors. The Open Skies agreements recently transacted offer 
U.S.  domestic  carriers  excellent  opportunities  but  also  pose  new  challenges  in  that 
these  strong  foreign  airlines  will  be  able  to  fly  new  routes  to,  from  and  beyond  the 
United  States  in  head-to-head  competition  with  U.S.  carriers.  In  that  this  merger 
will  result  in  the  new  company’s  having  a  strong  presence  throughout  the  globe— 
combining  Northwest’s  comprehensive  Asian  network  with  Delta’s  strong  trans-
atlantic and south/central American international networks—it will position the new 
company to be a very strong competitor to such foreign carriers. 

Question 7. What is the current state of your aircraft fleets as far as age and fuel 
economy?  What  does  the  merged  airline  plan  on  doing  with  aging  aircraft  and  less 
efficient aircraft in your fleet? 

Answer. During Delta’s bankruptcy restructuring process we reduced the number 
of aircraft types we fly, including eliminating the most fuel inefficient older aircraft 
from  our  fleet.  With  the  stronger  balance-sheet  we  anticipate  will  result  from  the 
merger  we  anticipate  being  able  to  exercise  existing  Delta  options  on  purchase  of 
approximately  20  new  widebody  aircraft,  and  will  consider  investments  in  other 
new, more fuel efficient aircraft to replace older, less fuel-efficient aircraft as capac-
ity  needs  warrant.  In  addition,  the  merged  company  would  maximize  use  of  com-
bined  fleets  by  matching  capacity  with  demand  more  effectively  than  the  two  car-
riers  can  do  separately,  using  the  largest  and  most  fuel  efficient  aircraft  practical 
for a given market. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR TO 

RICHARD H. ANDERSON 

Question 1. What will happen to the around 1,100 employees who work at North-
west  Airlines  headquarters  in  Eagan?  The  press  release  announcing  the  merger 
noted that the combined carrier intends to keep ‘‘executive offices’’ in the Twin Cit-
ies. But you also indicated at both the House and Senate Judiciary Committee hear-
ings in April 2008 that there would be job cuts—of around 1,000 employees—at both 
Delta’s  Atlanta  headquarters  as  well  as  Northwest’s  Eagan  headquarters?  Of  the 
approximately 1,100 employees who work in the Eagan headquarters, how many of 
these employees will lose their jobs? 

Answer. It is too early to determine. 
Question  1a.  Do  you  plan  to  eliminate  these  headquarters  jobs  through  natural 

attrition, or do you plan to actually layoff employees? 

Answer. There will likely be a combination of attrition, retirements and other op-
portunities  in  the  merged  company,  in  addition  to  some  layoffs  associated  with 
headquarters. 

Question 1b. Will you offer any of these Eagan headquarters-based employees who 
are  slated  to  be  laid  off  the  opportunity  to  move  to  Atlanta  or  will  these  jobs  be 
eliminated outright? 

Answer.  We  anticipate  that  there  will  be  opportunities  for  some  employees  in 

Minnesota to move to Atlanta, and for some to stay in Minnesota.

103 

Question  1c.  In  an  effort  to  streamline  the  combined  carriers’  headquarters  oper-

ations, will you offer the effected employees voluntary ‘‘buy out’’ packages? 

Answer.  Delta  has  actually  already  offered  employees  in  our  system  an  early  re-
tirement or early-out program. After that process has concluded, severance packages 
will  be  offered  to  headquarters  employees  not  asked  to  stay  on  with  the  combined 
company. 

Question 2. At the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee hearing in April 2008, I asked 
about  the  ‘‘staying  power’’  of  the  combined  carriers’  commitments  to  maintain  jobs, 
service  and  hubs.  Mr.  Anderson’s  response  was:  ‘‘The  issue  is  going  to  be  fuel.  Tell 
me where fuel will be.’’ What if the cost of jet fuel remains around where it is today? 
Are  your  commitments  premised  on  the  current  environment  of  high  fuel  prices  or 
are your commitments—to maintain jobs, service and hubs—based on a more favor-
able fuel environment? 

Answer.  Our  commitment  is  that  the  merger  transaction  itself  will  not  result  in 
elimination  of  service,  front-line  jobs  or  hubs.  We  will  take  the  steps  necessary  to 
provide  service  levels  commensurate  with  economic  conditions,  but  believe  that  the 
enhanced  network  and  stronger  balance  sheet  of  the  combined  carriers  will  enable 
the combined company to withstand increases in the cost of fuel better than the two 
stand-alone companies, including providing service, jobs and maintaining hubs. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

RAY NEIDL 

Question  1.  A  merged  Delta/Northwest  airline  is  expected  to  have  a  total  of  20 
percent  market  share  in  the  domestic  marketplace.  What  impact  will  additional 
mergers  that  are  currently  anticipated  have  on  nationwide  market  share  domesti-
cally and internationally? 

Answer.  Because  of  the  high  price  of  oil  we  do  not  believe  that  there  will  be  any 
additional  major  airline  mergers  at  this  time.  With  merger  costs  to  be  incurred  up 
front  and  benefits  accrued  at  a  later  date,  airline  management  believes  that  it  is 
too  risky  at  this  time  to  proceed.  Airlines  are  now  trying  to  conserve  cash  to  face 
the current fuel cost crisis. Bankruptcies and possible liquidations of certain airlines 
as a result of the oil price crisis may cure the problem of too many airlines and re-
lieve  future  pressure  on  mergers.  We  believe  that  three  large  full  service  network 
airlines supplemented by a few large low cost airlines would provide adequate com-
petition and service. Once things settle down, we believe new entries will once again 
spring  up  even  at  permanently  higher  fuel  costs  but  will  remain  niche  in  nature. 
Question  2.  Some  proponents  of  consolidation  in  the  aviation  industry  argue  that 
consolidation is necessary for air carriers to remain financially stable, deal with ris-
ing fuel costs, keep consumer prices relatively low, reduce duplicative capacity, and 
creating  stronger  route  structures  that  will  help  U.S.  carriers  better  compete  in  a 
global  market.  Do  you  think  you  could  explain  how  consolidation  in  this  case  will 
achieve  some  of  these  goals?  What  do  you  view  as  the  major  benefits  and  major 
drawbacks? 

Answer.  Consolidation  may  not  be  the  answer;  the  answer  is  that  we  have  too 
many  airlines  with  too  many  expensive  hub  operations  offering  too  many  seats  in 
a  high  fuel  cost  environment  and  this  is  what  has  to  be  addressed.  This  problem 
would  be  fixed  by  reducing  the  number  of  airlines  and  this  can  be  done  either 
through consolidation or letting some carriers go out of business. The former is prob-
ably  the  more  humane  way  of  handling  the  situation  from  an  employee,  passenger 
and investor viewpoint. In consolidation, more market mass resulting from mergers 
could  actually  generate  additional  incremental  revenues  through  enabling  the  car-
rier  to  offer  a  broader  market  line  and  possibly  through  stealing  revenue  from 
smaller competitors. A larger airline should also be able to reduce cost overhead and 
operate more efficiently if structured correctly. 

Question 3. The U.S. airline industry has experienced a major transformation over 
the past decade. LCCs have grown to represent approximately a quarter of the Na-
tion’s  market  share,  up  from  about  15  percent  in  2000.  What  led  to  this  LCC  in-
crease  in  market  share?  What  impact  do  you  think  consolidation  will  have  on  LCC 
market  share  within  the  domestic  marketplace?  Will  it  be  easier  or  more  difficult 
for LCCs to grow in a consolidated industry? 

Answer.  The  LCC’s  were  able  to  gain  market  share  after  9/11  when  the  network 
carriers cut back their capacity by about 10 percent. The LCC’s rushed in to fill the 
vacuum. If there is consolidation by the network airlines we believe that LCC’s will 
move  in  to  fill  the  vacuum  if  it  can  be  done  profitably  with  their  lower  cost  struc-

ture. However in the current high fuel cost environment, we do not expect as rapid 
an expansion as there was after 9/11. 

Question 4. We are all aware of the poor quarterly financial reports that were re-
cently  announced  by  the  domestic  legacy  carriers.  What  do  you  attribute  the  cause 
to be? Has the industry fully felt the economic impact of the economic slowdown and 
the increased fuel prices? What are you expecting for the upcoming quarters for air-
lines? 

Answer.  The  industry  financial  crisis  and  large  losses  is  due  primarily  to  run 
away  fuel  costs.  Airline  ticket  prices  cannot  be  increased  fast  enough  to  meet  the 
skyrocketing fuel price increases. We do not believe that the industry as yet has felt 
the full impact of increased fuel prices and the economic slowdown. Upcoming quar-
ters will produce large losses for the industry which we expect will lose over $5 bil-
lion this year. 

Question  5.  If  DOJ  is  to  approve  this  merger,  it  is  almost  certain  that  they  will 
require  divestiture  of  key  assets  as  a  condition  of  approving  the  consolidation  in 
order  to  ensure  viable  competition.  What  do  you  anticipate  as  being  necessary  or 
potential divestiture requirements resulting from this merger? Do the airlines have 
plans to divest under the current agreement? 

Answer.  Since  there  is  little  overlap  between  the  Delta  and  Northwest  systems, 

we do not expect the DOJ to mandate any significant divestiture of assets. 

Question 6. Will a consolidated aviation industry focus more heavily on their hubs 
for providing air service across the nation, or are there more plans to provide point- 
to-point service? 

Answer.  We  expect  the  network  carriers  to  continue  to  increase  their  concentra-
tion  on  their  key  hub  cities  to  flow  traffic  between  domestic  cities  and  onto  their 
international  routes  in  the  most  efficient  and  cost  conscious  manner.  At  current 
high fuel costs, it makes it difficult to do much point-to-point service except between 
major business centers.

Question. I am concerned that the DOJ will evaluate this merger in isolation and 
not  take  into  consideration  its  larger  effects  on  the  airline  industry  as  a  whole  and 
the  American  flying  public,  in  particular.  Should  Congress  consider  strengthening 
the  DOJ  airline  merger  review  process,  and  require  DOJ  to  consider  the  impact  of 
such mergers on employees, communities and the industry at-large? 

Answer. In theory I believe each proposed merger should be looked at individually 
by  the  DOJ.  It  is  more  in  the  realm  of  the  DOT  to  look  at  the  big  picture  affects 
of  mergers  since  that  department  is  more  aware  of  developments  in  the  industry 
and  worldwide  trends.  Any  review  process  concerning  merger  effects  on  employees, 
communities  or  the  industry  at  large  should  be  done  by  the  DOT.  Primarily  airline 
mergers  have  to  be  looked  on  as  a  business  proposal  unless  we  want  to  re-regulate 
the industry and be prepared to have the tax payer subsidize it (AmAir?). Investors 
should not be forced to subsidize losing business propositions and if other social fac-
tors  are  put  in  the  equation  we  should  be  prepared  to  have  the  taxpayer  subsidize 
it.

Question.  I  appreciate  hearing  of  your  concerns  about  management  within  the 
aviation  industry.  From  your  testimony  you  state  that  the  aviation  industry  is  cur-
rently  failing  employees,  consumers,  and  communities.  You  state  that  the  industry 
in recent years has been handed over to management teams with little or no under-
standing  of  the  interest  and  are  focused  primarily  on  pay  and  benefits  rather  than 
company  performance,  customer  service,  or  employee  morale.  Could  you  please  ex-
plain  your  thoughts  in  more  detail  and  cite  specific  examples  of  where  such  cor-
porate management decisions have led to a weakened airline industry? What is your 
current  view  of  this  proposed  merger?  Please  list  your  top  5  concerns  with  regard 
to employees affected by this merger. 

Answer.  With  only  a  couple  of  exceptions  (Continental  and  Southwest)  manage-
ment  in  the  airline  industry  failed  to  prepare  and  execute  a  business  plan  that 
would  have  protected  against  the  severe  economic  results  of  the  events  of 
September 11, 2001. They didn’t hedge fuel and they didn’t make any effort to pre-

serve  cash  reserves.  As  a  result  they  were  totally  unprepared  for  the  severe  eco-
nomic hardship of a post September 11 industry and the uncertainty of the market. 
A number of airlines—United and Northwest are the most well known examples— 
used  the  bankruptcy  courts  to  reorganize  and  renegotiate  contracts  with  workers, 
vendors and airports. However none of the bankrupt or near bankrupt carrier CEOs 
took any less of a salary or any fewer bonuses or stock options. In fact many of them 
used the bankruptcy process to manipulate their salaries and bonuses. 

The  most  blatantly  obvious  CEO  is  Glen  Tilton  of  United.  While  eliminating  em-
ployee  pensions  and  slashing  wages  in  bankruptcy,  he  managed  to  keep  his  $4.5 
million pension and has handsomely rewarded himself with numerous bonuses since 
emerging  from  bankruptcy.  He  came  directly  to  United  from  the  oil  industry,  took 
the  Company  through  bankruptcy  and  instead  of  focusing  on  keeping  the  company 
profitable  and  planning  for  the  long  term,  he  has  since  then  hung  out  the  For  Sale 
sign and focused on nothing but selling the airline or merging with another airline. 
This  shortsightedness  has  prevented  the  airline  from  focusing  on  surviving  this 
downturn. 

In  regards  to  your  questions  around  the  current  Delta/Northwest  merger,  the 
merger  as  it  has  been  proposed  has  no  protections  for  employees  and  certainly  no 
guarantees for the communities currently served by the 2 separate airlines. 

Our top 5 concerns for employees are—— 

1. Job Loss 
2. Forced Relocation 
3.No provision for severance package, retraining or relocation expenses 
4.  Places  the  collective  bargaining  rights  of  the  Northwest  flight  attendants  in 
serious jeopardy 
5.  Delta  management  using  the  merger  to  destroy  union  representation  at 
Northwest Airlines

Answer.  We  too  share  your  concerns  about  the  DOJ’s  review  process.  We  agree 
that  Congress  should  definitely  strengthen  the  DOJ  airline  merger  review  process 
and require that the impact of mergers on employees, communities and the industry 
as  a  whole  must  be  considered.  Just  as  the  repercussions  of  this  merger  will  not 
take place in a vacuum, the DOJ should not review the merger in a vacuum.
