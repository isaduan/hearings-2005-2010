HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SPACE AND AERONAUTICS

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

NASA’s Astronaut Health Care

System—Results of an
Independent Review

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Thursday,  September  6,  2007  at  10:00  a.m.,  the  House  Committee  on  Science
and Technology’s Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics will hold a hearing to ex-
amine the results of two reports on the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion’s  (NASA)  astronaut  medical  and  behavioral  health  care  system.  The  first,  the
report of the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee, provided an
independent assessment of NASA’s medical and behavioral health care system. The
second, a Johnson Space Center internal review considered opportunities for lessons
learned in light of the incident involving NASA astronaut Lisa Nowak. The hearing
will  explore  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  these  reports  and  any  actions
NASA plans to take in response to them.
Witnesses

Witnesses scheduled to testify at the hearing include the following:

Panel 1
Col. Richard E. Bachmann, Jr., Chair, NASA Astronaut Health Care System Re-
view  Committee;  Commander  and  Dean  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  School  of  Aerospace
Medicine
Dr. Richard S. Williams, Chief Health and Medical Officer, NASA
Dr.  Ellen  Ochoa,  Director,  Flight  Crew  Operations,  NASA  Johnson  Space  Center
Mr. Bryan O’Connor, Chief, Safety and Mission Assurance, NASA

Panel 2
Dr. Michael Griffin, Administrator, NASA

Potential Issues

The following are some of the potential issues that might be raised at the hearing:
• The  external  review  of  the  astronaut  health  care  system  identified  a  number
of  significant  concerns—what  was  the  basis  of  the  committee’s  findings  and
recommendations?

• The  external  review  of  the  astronaut  health  care  system  identified  a  number
of ‘‘problematic’’ cultural and structural issues. Is there any evidence that the
NASA culture, particularly as it relates to the astronaut program, unwittingly
encourages  the  downplaying  of  human  factors  problems  (substandard  task
performance,  risky  behaviors,  other  behavioral  issues)  that  if  unaddressed
may pose risks to flight safety or have mission impacts?

• How pervasive are the problematic conditions highlighted by the external re-
view  committee,  and  how  should  NASA  go  about  getting  an  answer  to  that
question?

• Are  NASA’s  decision  appeal  processes,  anonymous  reporting  systems,  and
other  safety  and  mission  assurance  efforts  adequately  capturing  human  fac-
tors risks, and if not, what should be done?

• To  what  extent,  if  at  all,  should  NASA  get  involved  in  the  off-duty  lives  of
its astronauts in the interest of ensuring that astronauts get the proper sup-
port  and  services  for  dealing  with  behavioral  issues  or  problems,  especially
those that may not violate a medical or behavioral health standard but which
could  potentially  pose  a  flight  safety  risk  or  have  a  mission  impact  if  left
unaddressed?

• How can NASA ensure that an open and objective environment exists within

the agency for addressing medical or behavioral concerns?

• What  explains  the  disconnect  between  the 

information  provided  by
interviewees  to  the  external  review  committee  and  the  information  provided
to Mr. O’Connor during his investigation?

• Is  NASA’s  timeline  for  resolving  questions  and  implementing  recommended
improvements  to  NASA  policies,  procedures,  and  practices  appropriate,  and
what  will  Congress  need  to  do,  if  anything,  to  ensure  that  the  recommenda-
tions are actually implemented?

Background Information

In  the  wake  of  the  arrest  of  astronaut  Lisa  Nowak,  the  NASA  Administrator  or-
dered  an  independent  external  review  of  NASA’s  astronaut  health  care  system,  fo-
cused  on  space  medicine  operations  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center  (JSC).  It  did  not
focus  on  the  specifics  of  the  Lisa  Nowak  incident.  In  addition,  an  internal  review
was  undertaken  by  JSC  management  to  determine  ‘‘whether  there  were  any  indica-
tors  which  could  have  prompted  NASA  to  take  actions  that  could  have  averted  the
sequence  of  events.’’  As  part  of  the  JSC  review,  ‘‘astronaut  selection  and  retention
procedures were reviewed to see if there were any lessons learned that could be incor-
porated into the improved practice of behavioral medicine.’’

A. Report of the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee

In  carrying  out  the  NASA  Administrator’s  directive,  Dr.  Richard  Williams,  the
NASA  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer  (CHMO),  prepared  the  task  statement  for
the external review committee; selected the Chairman of the committee; selected the
members  of  the  committee,  based  on  nominations  from  various  federal  agencies  of
‘‘appropriately credentialed physicians and mental health professionals, employed by
the  Federal  Government  or  on  active  duty  in  the  military  services,  and  experienced
in medical and behavioral health support to organizations and personnel engaged in
critical  or  hazardous  operations;’’  and  appointed  two  NASA  employees  as  ex-officio
members of the committee, one astronaut as a consultant, and one NASA employee
as executive secretary. The chairman of the committee was Col. Richard Bachmann,
Commander  of  the  USAF  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine  and  specialist  in  aerospace
medicine. A list of the committee members is included as Attachment 1 to this hear-
ing charter.

Purpose of the Assessment

As  stated  in  the  report  of  the  external  review  committee,  the  purpose  of  the  as-

sessment was as follows:

‘‘To  provide  rapid  objective  assessment,  problem  identification,  and  recommenda-
tions  for  action  or  further  study  of  the  following  specific  areas  to  the  Chief  Health
and Medical Officer and NASA Administrator:

1. Medical  evaluation  for  acceptance  to  the  Astronaut  Corps,  to  include  psycho-

logical testing

2. Annual medical examination and certification of astronauts for flight duty
3. Periodic medical and psychological evaluation and testing of astronauts
4. Astronaut certification for space flight, from a medical and behavioral health

perspective

5. Professional qualifications of health care providers
6. Quality/adequacy  of  medical  practice  relative  to  expected  standards  of  care

and

7. Administrative considerations of health services, including:

a. Provider credentials and privileging
b. Record-keeping
c. Communication and reporting
d. Disposition of aeromedical concerns; and

e. Privacy considerations

8. Behavioral  health  considerations  within  the  context  of  the  NASA  Personnel

Reliability Program (PRP)

These criteria were provided to the committee to help focus the review, but did not
constrain  or  limit  the  review.  During  the  first  committee  meeting,  the  CHMO  asked
the committee to provide opinions on the following additional questions:

9. To  what  extent  are  disorders  of  conduct  indicative  of  underlying  mental

health pathology?

10. To  what  extent  can  regular  psychological  testing  or  psychiatric  evaluation

predict a disorder of conduct or ‘act of passion’?

11. What  systemic  procedures  could  be  put  in  place  to  predict  disordered  con-

duct?’’

Approach and Schedule

The  review  committee  was  selected  and  appointed  in  late  February  2007.  The
committee  held  three  sets  of  meetings:  in  Washington,  DC  on  March  28th,  at  JSC
on  April  23–26th,  and  in  San  Antonio  on  May  30–31st.  During  the  JSC  meeting,
the  committee  members  received  briefings  from  and  had  meetings  with  NASA  per-
sonnel. Following that, the committee members split up and held private interviews
with  astronauts,  flight  surgeons,  and  astronaut  family  members.  Members  inter-
viewed  eight  of  21  space  medicine  flight  surgeons  [who  support  flight  crews],  all  of
the  clinic-assigned  flight  surgeons  [who  provide  clinic  services  for  astronauts  and
family  members]  and  all  of  the  behavioral  health  staff.  The  groups  also  reviewed
the facilities, offices, and relevant documents for those functional areas.

The  NASA  astronaut  office  informed  the  Astronaut  Corps  of  the  opportunity  to
speak  with  the  committee  on  a  voluntary  basis.  Fourteen  currently  active  astro-
nauts  (all  but  one  had  flown  in  space)  chose  to  speak  to  the  members.  Five  astro-
naut  family  members  also  volunteered  to  speak  to  committee  members.  After  the
JSC visit, the committee had follow-up conversations/e-mail exchanges with a num-
ber  of  the  interviewees.  The  interviews  were  intended  to  be  anonymous  and  con-
fidential,  and  Col.  Bachmann  cites  that  as  the  reason  the  committee’s  report  does
not  ‘‘name  names’’  or  provide  information  that  could  identify  specific  individuals.
There  were  no  prepared  sets  of  questions.  Instead,  the  members  conducted  open-
ended  interviews  to  allow  interviewees  to  offer  whatever  information  they  chose  to
share with the committee members.

The committee held its third and final meeting on May 30–31, 2007 at the USAF
School of Aerospace Medicine to consider draft findings that had been developed by
the members and to write the report. As stated in the report: ‘‘The findings and rec-
ommendations  expressed  in  this  report  represent  the  unanimous  opinion  of  the  com-
mittee.’’  The  option  of  doing  minority  reports  was  made  available  to  the  committee
members but none saw the need to do so. The committee submitted its draft report
on  June  21,  2007  to  the  NASA  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer  ‘‘to  allow  NASA
functional  areas  an  opportunity  to  provide  comments  and  correct  factual  errors  or
misstatements.’’  Col.  Bachmann  and  the  members  of  the  committee  briefed  the  sen-
ior  NASA  management  (including  the  NASA  Administrator  via  teleconference)  on
July  16,  2007.  NASA  Headquarters  released  the  report  to  the  public  and  held  a
press conference on July 27, 2007.

Major Findings of the External Review

The  external  review  committee’s  report  identified  a  number  of  significant  issues
related to NASA culture, communication, and behavioral concerns. In conversations
with staff, Col. Bachmann emphasized that the issues and concerns cited in the re-
port,  which  are  reflected  in  the  report’s  findings,  were  raised  by  the  interviewees
in  the  course  of  the  confidential  interviews.  For  example,  the  committee  members
did  not  ask  the  interviewees  about  alcohol  use  by  astronauts—the  incidents  cited
in  the  report  were  volunteered  by  interviewees  during  the  course  of  the  interviews
as  specific  examples  of  safety  concerns.  According  to  Col.  Bachmann,  various  con-
cerns  referenced  in  the  report  were  based  on  information  provided  by  interviewees
who were eyewitnesses, and did not represent second- or third-hand hearsay. More-
over, the types of concerns raised by interviewees were consistent across a large pro-
portion  of  the  interviewees.  As  noted  in  the  committee’s  report:  ‘‘Although  they  do
not  represent  a  random  or  exhaustive  sample  of  the  larger  population  of  astronauts
and  family  members,  the  issues  raised  were  remarkably  consistent  and  compelling
and deserve focused attention.’’

6

The  following  represent  some  of  the  most  notable  findings  in  the  external  review
report [a complete set of findings and recommendations can be found in the external
review committee’s report, which has been provided to Subcommittee Members]:

• ‘‘Many anecdotes were related that involved risky behaviors by astronauts that
were  well  known  to  the  other  astronauts  and  no  apparent  action  was  taken.
Peers  and  staff  fear  ostracism  if  they  identify  their  own  or  others’  problems.’’
• ‘‘As  the  review  progressed,  it  became  apparent  that  major  vulnerabilities,  un-
derlying  root  causes,  and  contributing  factors  extend  well  beyond  the  specific
medical  aspects  of  NASA  operations. . .These  issues  are  so  ingrained  and
longstanding that it will take senior leadership action to remediate them.’’
• ‘‘Problems  of  communication  were  evident  among  the  four  areas  addressed:
flight  medicine,  behavioral  health,  flight  medicine  clinic,  and  the  Astronaut
Office. This theme recurred in a variety of venues during the committee’s visit
to  JSC,  and  also  extended  to  communication  between  these  areas  at  JSC  and
Headquarters.’’
• ‘‘Several  senior  flight  surgeons  expressed  their  belief  that  their  medical  opin-
ions regarding astronaut fitness for duty, flight safety and mission accomplish-
ment  were  not  valued  by  leadership  other  than  to  validate  that  all  (medical)
systems  were  ‘‘go’’  for  on-time  mission  completion.  Instances  were  described
where major crew medical or behavioral problems were identified to astronaut
leadership  and  the  medical  advice  was  disregarded.  This  disregard  was  de-
scribed  as  ‘‘demoralizing’’  to  the  point  where  they  said  they  are  less  likely  to
report  concerns  of  performance  decrement.  Crew  members  raised  concerns,  re-
garding  substandard  astronaut  task  performance  which  were  similarly  dis-
regarded.’’
• ‘‘Interviews  with  both  flight  surgeons  and  astronauts  identified  some  episodes
of  heavy  use  of  alcohol  in  the  immediate  pre-flight  period,  which  has  led  to
flight safety concerns. Alcohol is freely used in crew quarters. Two specific in-
stances were described where astronauts had been so intoxicated prior to flight
that flight surgeons and/or fellow astronauts raised concerns to local on-scene
leadership  regarding  flight  safety.  However,  the  individuals  were  still  per-
mitted  to  fly.  The  medical  certification  of  astronauts  for  flight  duty  is  not
structured to detect such episodes, nor is any medical surveillance program by
itself likely to detect them or change the pattern of alcohol use.’’

• ‘‘Astronaut medical and behavioral health care is highly fragmented. . .’’
• ‘‘Psychological  testing  evaluation  is  conducted,  and  is  intended  to  identify  ap-
plicants who can adapt most readily and perform effectively in the extreme en-
vironment  of  space  flight.  However,  this  information  is  rarely  and  inconsist-
ently used.’’
• ‘‘There  is  no  periodic  psychological  evaluation  or  testing  conducted  on  astro-
nauts.  Once  selected  as  an  astronaut  candidate,  astronauts  have  no  psycho-
logical  evaluation  for  the  remainder  of  their  careers  unless  selected  for  long
duration missions.’’

Risky  Behaviors—‘‘Many  anecdotes  were  related  that  involved  risky  behaviors  by
astronauts that were well known to the other astronauts and no apparent action was
taken.  Peers  and  staff  fear  ostracism  if  they  identify  their  own  or  others’  problems.’’
JSC  officials  described  to  staff  several  mechanisms  that  are  in  place  for  peers  or
staff  to  bring  forward  concerns  about  astronaut  behavior,  performance,  or  concerns
about flight safety. Those mechanisms include anonymous safety reporting systems,
approaching  flight  surgeons,  the  chief  of  the  astronaut  office,  the  crew  commander,
or  other  management.  In  addition,  astronauts  have  access  to  the  behavioral  health
clinic,  the  Employee  Assistance  Program,  and  to  flight  surgeons.  However,  Col.
Bachmann  indicated  to  staff  that  the  external  review  heard  instances  of  concerns
about  personal  behavior  that  could  be  embarrassing  and  substandard  performance
during  training  and  on-orbit,  that  could  potentially  impact  a  mission  but  for  which
no actions were taken. He noted that human factors issues were a consistent theme
of the interviews, but that his committee was not equipped to determine how wide-
spread those issues were across NASA and that determining the extent of the prob-
lem should be an important task for agency management.
Barriers  to  Communication—‘‘Problems  of  communication  were  evident  among
the  four  areas  addressed:  flight  medicine,  behavioral  health,  flight  medicine  clinic,
and the Astronaut Office. This theme recurred in a variety of venues during the com-
mittee’s  visit  to  JSC,  and  also  extended  to  communication  between  these  areas  at
JSC and Headquarters.’’ JSC officials told staff that JSC is preparing an anonymous
survey to explore the relationship between astronauts and flight surgeons and man-

agers;  to  identify  whether  astronauts  or  flight  surgeons  have  concerns  in  raising
flight  safety  or  crew  suitability  issues  or  whether  barriers  exist  to  doing  so;  and
whether there are suggestions for changes to policies and procedures. A group from
JSC  Human  Resources,  including  individuals  with  experience  in  survey  design,  is
developing the survey and will analyze the results. The Flight Crew Operations Di-
rectorate and the Space Life Sciences Directorate, among others, are providing input
on  the  questions  to  be  included  in  the  anonymous  survey.  (Staff  has  assembled  a
non-comprehensive  list  of  the  key  NASA  and  JSC  offices,  and  associated  office  re-
sponsibilities, involved in Astronaut Health Care and Safety that is provided as At-
tachment  2.)  The  Flight  Crew  Operations  Directorate  told  staff  that  it  will  hold  a
Town  Hall  meeting  with  astronauts  to  discuss  the  results  of  the  survey.  JSC  plans
to  issue  the  survey  in  mid-September.  The  results  will  be  summarized  in  a  report
that  will  be  delivered  to  the  JSC  Director.  While  supporting  the  idea  of  an  anony-
mous survey, Col. Bachmann told staff that he thinks that it is very important that
the questions be structured to avoid being overly narrow in focus; rather, the ques-
tions  need  to  be  open-ended  to  encourage  anonymous  comment,  and  the  questions
should  be  comprehensive  enough  to  cover  all  of  the  issues  raised  in  the  report.  In
that regard, NASA might benefit from having its proposed survey reviewed by exter-
nal survey experts.
Disregard  of  Flight  Surgeon  and  Crew  Opinions—Several  senior  flight  sur-
geons  expressed  their  belief  that  their  medical  opinions  regarding  astronaut  fitness
for  duty,  flight  safety  and  mission  accomplishment  were  not  valued  by  leadership
other  than  to  validate  that  all  (medical)  systems  were  ‘‘go’’  for  on-time  mission  com-
pletion.  Instances  were  described  where  major  crew  medical  or  behavioral  problems
were identified to astronaut leadership and the medical advice was disregarded. This
disregard was described as ‘‘demoralizing’’ to the point where they said they are less
likely  to  report  concerns  of  performance  decrement.  Crew  members  raised  concerns
regarding  substandard  astronaut  task  performance  which  were  similarly  dis-
regarded.  JSC  medical  officials  indicated  that  professional  disagreements  among
flight  surgeons  and  between  flight  surgeons  and  program  officials  could  occur  and
were not suppressed. They described to staff several appeals mechanisms that flight
surgeons  can  take  should  they  choose  to  seek  further  consideration  of  a  final  med-
ical decision that differs from the one they put forth. One official noted that he was
unaware  of  cases  where  flight  surgeons  felt  disregarded  and  was  not  aware  of  any
cases  in  which  a  flight  surgeon  had  made  a  medical  decision  that  had  been  over-
ruled  by  Shuttle  or  ISS  program  management.  Col.  Bachmann  indicated  that  the
interviewees  themselves  were  the  ones  using  the  word  ‘‘disregarded,’’  and  that  it
was a theme that recurred in the interviews. Mention of ‘‘flight safety’’ and ‘‘mission
impact  concerns  came  directly  from  the  interviewees.  He  also  noted  that  the  com-
mittee  heard  from  individuals  who  chose  not  to  take  concerns  to  the  next  level  of
management due to the ‘‘demoralizing’’ effects of being disregarded.
Use  of  Alcohol  in  Pre-flight  Period—‘‘Interviews  with  both  flight  surgeons  and
astronauts  identified  some  episodes  of  heavy  use  of  alcohol  by  astronauts  in  the  im-
mediate  pre-flight  period,  which  has  led  to  flight  safety  concerns.  Alcohol  is  freely
used  in  crew  quarters.  Two  specific  instances  were  described  where  astronauts  had
been  so  intoxicated  prior  to  flight  that  flight  surgeons  and/or  fellow  astronauts
raised  concerns  to  local  on-scene  leadership  regarding  flight  safety.  However,  the  in-
dividuals were still permitted to fly. The medical certification of astronauts for flight
duty  is  not  structured  to  detect  such  episodes,  nor  is  any  medical  surveillance  pro-
gram  by  itself  likely  to  detect  them  or  change  the  pattern  of  alcohol  use.’’  As  noted
above,  Col.  Bachmann  stressed  that  in  its  anonymous  interviews  the  committee
members did not use a prepared set of questions and did not ask about alcohol use.
Instead the instances of alcohol use were offered up by the interviewees as examples
of  safety  concerns  they  had  witnessed.  He  later  elaborated  in  the  NASA  press  con-
ference  that  one  instance  cited  involved  a  T–38  aircraft  and  the  other  involved  an
ISS/Soyuz  launch  opportunity.  Further,  during  the  NASA  press  conference  that  ac-
companied  the  public  release  of  the  external  review  report,  Col.  Bachmann  stated
that ‘‘the two specific incidents of alcohol use that we put into the report were specifi-
cally chosen to illustrate a larger problem, to call attention to the larger issue which
is the role of the flight surgeon in protecting both the individual’s health, flight safe-
ty,  and  mission  completion,  and  the  fact  that  the  flight  surgeons  and  other  astro-
nauts who described their role in these incidences and other which we did not obtain
further  details  on  were  to  say  that  they  felt  concerned  that  their  professional  input
seemed to be disregarded, at least at the local level, and that they were demoralized
by  that  disregard  to  the  point  that  they  felt  like  they  would  be  less  likely  to  report
concerns  or  performance  decrement  in  the  future.’’  Col.  Bachmann  indicated  to  staff
that  based  on  the  information  provided  to  the  committee  in  the  interviews,  he  con-

sidered the reports of alcohol use to be more credible than NASA’s characterization
of  them  as  simply  ‘‘allegations.’’  NASA  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance  chief  Bryan
O’Connor  conducted  an  investigation  of  the  reported  instances  of  alcohol  use  and
concluded  that  ‘‘within  the  scope  and  limitations  of  this  review,  I  was  unable  to
verify  any  case  where  a  space  flight  crew  member  was  impaired  on  launch  day,  or
where there was a disregard by managers of a flight surgeon or co-crew member rec-
ommendation that a crew member not fly Shuttle or Soyuz.’’

B. NASA Response to Recommendations of External Review

According  to  a  NASA  ‘‘Fact  Sheet  on  the  Findings  of  the  Astronaut  Health  Care
System  Review  Committee,’’  that  accompanied  public  release  of  the  review  com-
mittee report on July 27, 2007, NASA reported the following steps to respond to the
committee’s recommendations:

tion process

• ‘‘Look for ways to enhance use of behavioral health data in the astronaut selec-
• Take  steps  to  ensure  that  flight  surgeons,  trainers,  and  astronauts  are  free  to
communicate concerns of flight safety to senior leadership and encourage such
communication

ments

• Adopt a formal code of conduct for the Astronaut Corps
• Provide regular training to flight surgeons regarding behavioral health assess-
• Promote  better  communication  from  flight  surgeons  to  all  astronauts  on  their
personal  status  with  regard  to  medical  qualification  for  space  flight  assign-
ments
• Work to enhance a program of external peer review of NASA’s medical and be-
• Establish one credentialing and privileging authority for both the flight medi-
cine  and  behavioral  health  providers,  with  documented  processes  for  account-
ability
• Institute  behavioral  health  assessments  in  conjunction  with  annual  astronaut

havioral health staff

flight physicals’’

During  the  press  conference  held  on  July  27,  2007,  Ms.  Shana  Dale,  NASA  Dep-

uty Administrator, stated that:

‘‘NASA’s existing T–38 Aircraft Alcohol Use policy that has historically been ap-
plied  to  space  flight  has  been  explicitly  extended  as  an  interim  policy  to  flight
on  any  space  craft.  This  interim  policy  prohibits  alcohol  use  for  12  hours  prior
to  flight  and  further  states  that  astronauts  will  neither  be  under  the  influence
nor the effects of alcohol at the time of launch. A comprehensive review of alcohol
use policy prior to aircraft use or space flight is already underway.’’

In  addition,  on  July  26,  2007,  the  Deputy  Administrator  of  NASA,  requested  an
internal  review  of  ‘‘reported  allegations  of  heavy  use  of  alcohol  by  astronauts  in  the
immediate  pre-(space)  flight  period.’’  These  incidences  were  identified  in  the  report
of the Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee. A summary of the selected
issues, findings, and recommendations of the Space Flight Safety Review is provided
below.  NASA  has  indicated  to  staff  that  additional  responses  to  the  report  and  a
recommendations implementation plan will be forthcoming later in the year.

Space Flight Safety Review

The  safety  review  was  conducted  by  the  Chief  of  the  Safety  and  Mission  Assur-
ance, Mr. Bryan O’Connor. According to the final report, which was released to the
public on August 29, 2007, the scope of the review ‘‘focuses on the space flight safety
implications  of  alcohol  use  or  abuse. . .those  things  that  could  cause  impairment
during launch day flight preparation.’’ The after effects of alcohol use, such as hang-
over,  were  included  in  the  scope  of  the  review.  ‘‘The  relevant  question. . .was,  ‘Did
we  have  a  situation  where  a  crew  member  presented  on  launch  morning  in  an  im-
paired  state,  was  observed  as  such  by  flight  surgeon  or  another  crew  member,  and
was  then  cleared  to  fly  by  operational  management  over  the  objections  of  the  flight
surgeon  (or  other  crew  member)?’  Aircraft  flying  operations  in  general  were  out  of
scope.’’

According  to  the  written  report,  the  safety  review  involved  inspection  of  crew
quarters  facilities  at  JSC  and  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  and  a  review  of  policies
and  procedures  before  launch.  Records  of  JSC  and  Space  Shuttle  program  hotlines,
the  NASA  Safety  Reporting  System  (NSRS),  and  NASA’s  close  call  and  mishap  re-
porting  systems  for  ‘‘astronaut  alcohol  abuse  and  space  or  aircraft  flight’’  were  also

examined.  The  review  examined  this  data  over  the  past  20  years.  In  addition,  the
review  encompassed  voluntary  interviews,  held  on  a  non-confidential  basis,  with
astronauts,  flight  surgeons,  research  and  operations  support  nurses,  Shuttle-suit
technicians,  close-out-crew  technicians,  and  the  mangers  and  staff  of  flight  crew
quarters.
Selected Findings and Recommendations

• Finding: ‘‘Alcohol is available for crew use, and although it is possible to abuse
it during limited private times, the culture of professionalism in today’s Astro-
naut  Corps,  along  with  the  highly  visible,  structured  and  supervised  schedule
during  the  last  several  days  prior  to  launch  provide  reasonable  controls  to
avoid flying an alcohol-impaired crew member.’’
• Finding:  ‘‘In  light  of  all  the  other  controls  in  place  on  launch  day,  the  L–0
flight surgeon check provides a reasonable likelihood of identifying signs of ill-
ness  or  impairment  of  the  level  that  would  threaten  flight  safety,  but  it  could
be  supplemented  by  closer  first  hand  observation  prior  to  crew  departure  for
the pad.’’

Æ Recommendation:  ‘‘A  flight  surgeon  should  be  located  in  the  suit  room
during  suit  up  to  allow  more  direct  contact  with  the  crew  members  on
launch  day  and  reduce  the  reliance  on  a  suit  tech  (non-clinician)  picking
up any last minute medical issue.’’

The report includes reference to the T–38 policy on alcohol use per Aircraft Oper-
ations and Training Procedures: T–38 Operating Procedures, Volume 1. JSC Aircraft
Operations Division, 2005:

‘‘5.4.3  Alcohol  A  crew  member  is  not  qualified  for  flight  (takeoff)  within  12
hours of consuming alcoholic beverages. NASA air crews are expected to conduct
themselves  in  a  common  sense  manner.  Excessive  drinking  even  prior  to  12
hours,  enough  to  cause  a  hangover,  is  outside  the  spirit  of  the  regulations.  The
policy is that air crews will neither be under the influence nor the effects of alco-
hol at the time of takeoff.’’

As  noted  above,  the  NASA  Deputy  Administrator  has  stated  that  this  policy  has
been  expanded  to  include  space  flight.  According  to  NASA  medical  personnel,  the
medical  basis  for  applying  the  12-hour  rule  to  space  flight  operations  has  not  yet
been determined.

C. Johnson Space Center (JSC) Internal Review Findings

As  noted  earlier  in  this  hearing  charter,  ‘‘In  response  to  the  actions  of  astronaut
Lisa Nowak. . .NASA JSC conducted an internal review of records and of the work-
place.  There  were  two  purposes  for  the  internal  review.  First,  NASA  JSC  looked  to
determine  whether  there  were  any  indicators  which  could  have  prompted  NASA  to
take  actions  that  could  have  averted  the  sequence  of  events.  In  addition,  astronaut
selection  and  retention  procedures  were  reviewed  to  see  if  there  were  any  lessons
learned  that  could  be  incorporated  into  the  improved  practice  of  behavioral  medi-
cine.’’

The assessment considered 1) existing psychological screening for admittance into
the Astronaut Corps and the nature of any ongoing psychological evaluations during
an astronaut’s career, 2) any indicators, including interactions with Lisa Nowak and
other  astronauts  or  NASA  employees  that  may  have  raised  concerns,  and  3)  rec-
ommended changes to practices or procedures and lessons learned for the future.

The review included the following recommendations:

nual medical flight physicals.

• ‘‘Conduct a 30-minute Behavioral Medicine assessment in conjunction with an-
• Perform Behavioral Medicine flight assessments for Shuttle crew members.
• Enhance  aeronautical  adaptability  ratings  (an  assessment  of  fitness  for  flying

duties) in astronaut medical selections.’’

D. Activities of Other Oversight and Advisory Bodies

The  Aerospace  Safety  Advisory  Panel  (ASAP)  has  not  issued  a  position  on  either

the internal or external report.

According  a  letter  dated  August  24,  2007  sent  from  the  NASA  Inspector  General
to  the  NASA  Administrator,  ‘‘In  September  2007,  we  plan  to  initiate  a  review  of
NASA’s  actions  taken  in  response  to  reports  of  astronauts’  pre-flight  use  of  alco-
hol. . . Our review will evaluate the report of the Astronaut Health Care System Re-
view  Committee  and  the  SMA  [Safety  and  Mission  Assurance]  review,  including

by our office is warranted.’’

Chairman UDALL. I want to first welcome all of our witnesses to
today’s hearing. We appreciate your service to the Nation and your
assistance  to  this  subcommittee  as  we  carry  out  our  oversight  re-
sponsibilities.

In  particular,  I  would  like  to  thank  Colonel  Bachmann  and  his
review  committee  for  their  efforts  to  provide  NASA  and  the  Con-
gress with an independent assessment of NASA’s astronaut health
care system.

I  would  also  like  to  thank  Administrator  Griffin  for  his  willing-
ness  to  ask  for  such  a  review.  I  think  it  was  a  good  decision  that
reflects well on the agency.

It  is  clear  to  me,  and  I  think  all  Americans,  that  NASA’s  astro-
nauts  represent  the  Nation’s  best  and  brightest.  We  all  respect
their  skill  and  bravery.  In  carrying  out  their  challenging  missions
they often make it look so easy that we sometimes forget that they
are human beings who face the same medical and behavioral issues
that  the  rest  of  us  have  to  deal  with,  along  with  the  added  rigors
of  high-stress  jobs,  long  hours  of  training,  extended  absences  from
families and friends, and high-risk space flights.

It  is  thus  critically  important  that  NASA  ensure  that  the  astro-
nauts  be  provided  with  the  best  possible  medical  and  behavioral
care throughout their careers.

In  addition,  NASA  astronauts,  flight  surgeons,  and  support  per-
sonnel  need  to  be  confident  that  the  lines  of  communication  with
the agency are open and responsive so that concerns can be quickly
identified  and  addressed  in  a  manner  that  maintains  the  level  of
trust so vital to safety and optimal performance. I don’t think any-
one inside NASA would disagree with those goals.

That  is  why  after  reviewing  Colonel  Bachmann’s  committee’s  re-
port  I  decided  that  this  subcommittee  needed  to  hold  a  hearing  to
examine  the  report’s  findings  and  recommendations.  However,  my
decision was not made for the reasons that you might think.

While there has been a great deal of attention given to the find-
ing  related  to  alcohol  use,  and  I  have  little  doubt  that  there  will
be  discussion  of  that  finding  at  today’s  hearing,  too,  I  think  we  do
a  real  disservice  to  the  independent  review  committee  if  we  ignore
the  warning  flags  they  are  raising  about  the  state  of  communica-
tions within the agency on both medical and behavioral matters af-
fecting the astronauts.

Let  me  read  just  a  few  of  the  findings  from  the  report  that  I
think  should  concern  us  all.  ‘‘Many  anecdotes,’’  and  I  am  now
quoting  from  the  report,  ‘‘were  related  that  involved  risky  behav-
iors  by  astronauts  that  were  well  known  to  the  other  astronauts
and  no  apparent  action  was  taken.  Peers  and  staff  fear  ostracism
if they identify their own or others’ problems.’’

To  continue  quoting  from  the  report,  ‘‘Several  senior  flight  sur-
geons  expressed  their  belief  that  their  medical  opinions  regarding
astronaut  fitness  for  duty,  flight  safety,  and  mission  accomplish-
ment were not valued by leadership other than to validate that all
medical  systems  were  go  for  an  on-time  mission  completion.  In-
stances were described where major crew medical or behavior prob-
lems  were  identified  to  astronaut  leadership,  and  the  medical  ad-
vice was disregarded. This disregard was described as demoralizing
to the point where they said they are less likely to report concerns

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

15

of  performance  decrement.  Crew  members  raised  concerns  regard-
ing  substandard  astronaut  task  performance  which  were  similarly
disregarded.’’

‘‘As the review progressed,’’ again, I am quoting from the report,
‘‘it  became  apparent  that  major  vulnerabilities,  underlying  root
causes,  and  contributing  factors  extend  well  beyond  the  specific
medical aspects of NASA operations. These issues are so ingrained
and longstanding that it will take senior leadership action to reme-
diate them.

‘‘There  is  no  periodic  psychological  evaluation  or  testing  con-
ducted on astronauts. Once selected as an astronaut candidate, as-
tronauts  have  no  psychological  evaluation  for  the  remainder  of
their  careers  unless  selected  for  long  duration  missions.  Astronaut
medical  and  behavioral  health  care  is  highly  fragmented.’’  That
ends the quoting directly from the report itself.

And  I  don’t  think  anyone  can  listen  to  those  findings  and  think
all  is  well  within  NASA’s  astronaut  health  care  system.  This  sub-
committee  needs  to  hear  from  Colonel  Bachmann  the  basis  for  his
review panel’s findings.

Equally  important,  this  subcommittee  needs  to  hear  from  NASA
management  their  plans  for  addressing  the  concerns  raised  by  the
independent review, not just the alcohol-related ones.

Whatever the merits of focusing the agency’s attention on trying
to  get  employees  to  publicly  verify  or  refute  reports  of  alcohol  use
that  those  employees  had  provided  in  confidence  to  the  inde-
pendent  review  committee,  I  think  it  runs  the  risk  of  unintention-
ally  worsening  a  communications  environment  at  NASA  in  which,
to  quote  the  independent  review  committee,  ‘‘Peers  and  staff  fear
ostracism if they identify their own or others’ problems.’’

Instead,  it  may  be  more  appropriate  to  the  disconnect,  what  is
being  said  in  private  and  what  is  being  said  in  public  by  NASA
personnel  and  another  indicator  that  the  broader  issues  raised  by
the independent review committee warrant close and sustained at-
tention.  And  I  certainly  hope  that  that  will  be  the  approach  taken
in the days and weeks ahead.

Well,  we  have  a  great  deal  to  examine  today.  I  again  want  to

welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to your testimony.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MARK UDALL

Good morning. I first want to welcome all of our witnesses to today’s hearing.
We  appreciate  your  service  to  the  Nation  and  your  assistance  to  this  sub-

committee as we carry out our oversight responsibilities.

In particular, I would like to thank Col. Bachmann and his review committee for
their efforts to provide NASA and the Congress with an independent assessment of
NASA’s astronaut health care system.

I’d  also  like  to  thank  Administrator  Griffin  for  his  willingness  to  ask  for  such  a

review—I think it was a good decision that reflects well on the agency.

It  is  clear  to  me  that  NASA’s  astronauts  represent  the  Nation’s  best  and  bright-

In  addition,  NASA  astronauts,  flight  surgeons,  and  support  personnel  need  to  be
confident  that  the  lines  of  communication  within  the  agency  are  open  and  respon-
sive  so  that  concerns  can  be  quickly  identified  and  addressed  in  a  manner  that
maintains the level of trust so vital to safety and optimal performance.

I don’t think anyone inside NASA would disagree with those goals.

nauts.

us all:

• ‘‘Many anecdotes were related that involved risky behaviors by astronauts that
were  well  known  to  the  other  astronauts  and  no  apparent  action  was  taken.
Peers  and  staff  fear  ostracism  if  they  identify  their  own  or  others’  problems.’’
• ‘‘Several  senior  flight  surgeons  expressed  their  belief  that  their  medical  opin-
ions regarding astronaut fitness for duty, flight safety and mission accomplish-
ment  were  not  valued  by  leadership  other  than  to  validate  that  all  (medical)
systems  were  ‘‘go’’  for  on-time  mission  completion.  Instances  were  described
where major crew medical or behavioral problems were identified to astronaut
leadership  and  the  medical  advice  was  disregarded.  This  disregard  was  de-
scribed  as  ‘‘demoralizing’’  to  the  point  where  they  said  they  are  less  likely  to
report  concerns  of  performance  decrement.  Crew  members  raised  concerns  re-
garding  substandard  astronaut  task  performance  which  were  similarly  dis-
regarded.’’
• ‘‘As  the  review  progressed,  it  became  apparent  that  major  vulnerabilities,  un-
derlying  root  causes,  and  contributing  factors  extend  well  beyond  the  specific
medical  aspects  of  NASA  operations. . .These  issues  are  so  ingrained  and
longstanding that it will take senior leadership action to remediate them.’’
• ‘‘There  is  no  periodic  psychological  evaluation  or  testing  conducted  on  astro-
nauts.  Once  selected  as  an  astronaut  candidate,  astronauts  have  no  psycho-
logical  evaluation  for  the  remainder  of  their  careers  unless  selected  for  long
duration missions.’’

• ‘‘Astronaut medical and behavioral health care is highly fragmented. . .’’

I don’t think anyone can listen to those findings and think all is well with NASA’s

This  subcommittee  needs  to  hear  from  Col.  Bachmann  the  basis  for  his  review

astronaut health care system.

panel’s findings.

Equally  importantly,  this  subcommittee  needs  to  hear  from  NASA  management
their  plans  for  addressing  the  concerns  raised  by  the  independent  review—not  just
the alcohol-related ones.

Whatever the merits of focusing the agency’s attention on trying to get employees
to publicly verify or refute reports of alcohol use that those employees had provided
in confidence to the independent review committee, I think it runs the risk of unin-
tentionally  worsening  a  communications  environment  at  NASA  in  which,  to  quote
the  independent  review  committee:  ‘‘Peers  and  staff  fear  ostracism  if  they  identify
their own or other’s problems.’’

Instead,  it  may  be  more  appropriate  to  take  the  ‘‘disconnect’’  between  what  is
being  said  in  private  and  what  is  being  said  in  public  by  NASA  personnel  as  an-
other indicator that the broader issues raised by the independent review committee
warrant close and sustained attention.

I hope that will be the approach taken in the days and weeks ahead.
Well,  we  have  a  great  deal  to  examine  today.  I  again  want  to  welcome  our  wit-

nesses, and I look forward to your testimony.

Chairman UDALL. The Chair now is pleased to recognize the gen-
tleman  from  Florida,  the  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Feeney,  for  an
opening statement.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you  for
having  this  important  hearing.  I  want  to  tell  you  that  it  is  impor-

tant  enough  that  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Full  Committee,  the
esteemed  Mr.  Hall,  is  here.  I  offered  to  defer  to  let  him  give  the
first  opening  speech,  but  he  thought  our  weakest  link  ought  to  go
first.

But we take the challenges that NASA has in the behavioral and
the  physical  and  the  psychological  well  being  as  very,  very  impor-
tant,  and  this  is  an  opportunity,  both  for  oversight  committees  of
Congress and NASA and other outside experts to find ways to dra-
matically improve as we go forward the well being of astronauts in
a wide variety of areas.

After  the  Lisa  Nowak  incident  earlier  this  year,  NASA  Adminis-
trator  Mike  Griffin,  to  his  credit,  convened  the  NASA  Astronaut
Health  Care  System  Review  Committee.  I  want  to  thank  this  dis-
tinguished  panel  of  aerospace  medical  experts  for  their  service.  I
also  want  to  commend  Administrator  Griffin  for  inviting  inde-
pendent review of the health care system.

We  can  put  the  report’s  sensationalistic  element  aside  for  a  mo-
ment. The committee provided several thoughtful recommendations
to  heighten  the  importance  of  human  factors  to  improve  the  moni-
toring of each astronaut’s physical and mental well being. After the
Shuttle is retired, NASA’s Constellation program will return Amer-
icans  to  the  Moon  for  extended  stays.  An  astronaut’s  physical  and
psychological  well  being  will  be  more  important  in  the  future  of
America’s space program and not less important.

So  it  is  imperative  to  thoroughly  examine  this  issue  and  estab-
lish an astronaut health care system that properly addresses future
and  not  just  current  medical  concerns.  I  note  that  one  of  the  chal-
lenges  in  going  beyond  low-Earth  orbit  with  human  beings,  even
bigger  perhaps  than  the  mechanical  and  technical  and  scientific
challenges, are the physiological challenges on astronauts that will
spend extended periods in space.

Unfortunately,  the  report’s  sensationalistic  element,  specifically
allegations  of  astronaut  intoxication  shortly  before  space  flight,
drowned  out  the  remainder  of  the  report.  Since  the  report’s
issuance  in  late  July,  these  allegations  remain  uncorroborated.  No
eye witness has come forward to specifically state who, what, when,
and where.

So  far  the  search  for  corroboration  reveals  the  shortcomings  of
relying  on  anonymous  allegations,  and  I  know  that  the  Colonel
Bachmann’s  committee  had  its  mission,  and  it  did  it  well,  and
there  are  advantages  to  having  anonymous  and  voluntary  people
come  forward,  but  there  are  disadvantages,  too.  While  anonymity
can  certainly  promote  candor,  but  without  corroboration  such  alle-
gations  often  unfairly  force  good  men  and  good  women  to  prove  a
negative.

My office has heard from astronauts and NASA officials all deep-
ly  devoted  to  human  space  flight  and  highly  credible  who  ada-
mantly deny this misbehavior represents current or recent conduct.
These  people  have  longstanding,  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  astro-
naut  program  and  simply  state  that  alcohol  influence  during  the
immediate  pre-flight  period  does  not  exist.  Because  an  astronaut
interacts  with  so  many  people  during  this  period,  I  find  it  difficult
to believe that such behavior could go undetected.

But I don’t want the alcohol issue to detract from a more trouble-
some finding that flight surgeons and astronauts in general may be
hesitant  to  report  major  crew  medical  or  behavioral  problems  be-
cause their concerns would be disregarded or ignored.

And James Oberg, a distinguished and respected space commen-
tator, followed up last month with a very thoughtful story detailing
inconsistent approaches to significant astronaut health concerns.

I  want  to  applaud  NASA  for  being  open  to  the  committee’s  rec-
ommendations,  and  I  join  the  distinguished  Chairman  of  this  sub-
committee  in  suggesting  that  we  focus  on  the  future  and  how  we
can  improve  astronaut  safety  and  well  being,  and  I  think  that  is
the approach NASA should and will take.

This type of culture, normally called a normalization of deviance
after the first Shuttle disaster, has contributed now to two Shuttle
accidents.  It  cannot  be  allowed  to  flourish  in  the  most  demanding
of  human  endeavors,  that  is  human  space  flight.  We  have  to  be
ever  vigilant  against  such  behavior,  and  I  am  very  much  appre-
ciative for Chairman Udall for calling this hearing.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE TOM FEENEY

After  the  Astronaut  Lisa  Nowak  incident  earlier  this  year,  NASA  Administrator
Mike Griffin convened the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee.
I want to thank this distinguished panel of aerospace medical experts for their serv-
ice.  I  also  want  to  commend  Administrator  Griffin  for  inviting  independent  review
of this health care system.

If  we  can  put  the  report’s  sensationalistic  element  aside  for  a  moment,  the  com-
mittee  provided  several  thoughtful  recommendations  to  heighten  the  importance  of
human factors and to improve the monitoring of each astronaut’s physical and men-
tal well-being.

After the Shuttle is retired, NASA’s Constellation program will return Americans
to the Moon for extended stays. An astronaut’s physical and psychological well-being
will be more and not less important. So it is imperative to thoroughly examine this
issue and establish an astronaut health care system that properly addresses future
and not just current medical concerns.

Unfortunately,  the  report’s  sensationalistic  element—allegations  of  astronaut  in-

toxication shortly before space flight—drowned out the remainder of the report.

Since  the  report’s  issuance  in  late  July,  these  allegations  remain  uncorroborated.
No  eyewitness  has  come  forward  to  specifically  state  who,  what,  when,  and  where.
So far, this search for corroboration reveals the shortcomings of relying on anony-
mous  allegations.  Anonymity  can  certainly  promote  candor.  But  absent  corrobora-
tion, such allegations unfairly force good men and women to prove a negative.

My  office  has  heard  from  astronauts  and  NASA  officials—all  deeply  devoted  to
human space flight and highly credible—who adamantly deny this misbehavior rep-
resents current or recent conduct. These people have longstanding first-hand knowl-
edge  of  the  astronaut  program  and  simply  state  that  alcohol  influence  during  the
immediate  pre-flight  period  doesn’t  exist.  Because  an  astronaut  interacts  with  so
many people during this period, I find it difficult to believe that such behavior could
go undetected.

But I don’t want the alcohol issue to detract from a more troublesome finding that
flight surgeons and astronauts are hesitant to report ‘‘major crew medical or behav-
ioral problems’’ because their concerns would be disregarded or ignored. And James

health concerns.

This type of culture—called a normalization of deviance—contributed to the Chal-
lenger and Columbia accidents. It cannot be allowed to flourish in the most demand-
ing  of  human  endeavors—human  space  flight.  We  must  be  ever  vigilant  against
such behavior.

Today’s hearing is part of that vigilance.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Feeney.  At  this  point  I  am
pleased  to  acknowledge  the  presence  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Full
Committee,  Chairman  Bart  Gordon,  at  the  hearing,  and  I  would
like to ask unanimous consent to recognize him for any remarks he
would like to make.

Without objection so ordered. Mr. Gordon.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Chairman Udall. Let me say that
you  and  Ranking  Member  Feeney  have  made  my  job  a  lot  easier.
You have summed it up very well. I think there is a bipartisan in-
terest  obviously  in  this  issue,  and  although  the  alcohol  issues  got
a  lot  of  the  early  publicity  and  certainly  is  something  to  be  con-
cerned  about,  in  all  reports  I  think  it  indicates  that  that  was  a
very, a situation that was an anomaly.

The  bigger  concern  is,  is  there  an  openness,  is  there  a  com-
fortableness within the NASA organization to other issues of flight
safety? And we have different, I mean, we just have different testi-
mony here, and I think that what I know is that there is certainly
smoke.  Whether  there  is  fire,  we  won’t  be  able  to  determine  that
today. I have no question that both panels are individuals of integ-
rity, trying to do the right thing, and I think this will be a healthy
exercise for NASA.

But the real question is, you know, is there that comfortableness
within  the  NASA  flight  safety  operation  that  allows  everyone  to
step  forward  without  feeling  somehow  they  are  ostracized,  without
feeling  somehow  they  have  been  demoralized,  quoting  the  report,
about prior overlooks?

So, again, I welcome, and I think Mr. Feeney and Mr. Udall have
summed  up  our  charge  today,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  this
testimony  and  some  interaction  between  the  members  of  the  pan-
els.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Thank you, Chairman Udall, for yielding to me. I will be brief.
When  NASA  released  the  report  of  the  independent  review  panel  that  examined
NASA’s  astronaut  health  care  system,  it  provoked  a  bit  of  a  firestorm  due  to  the
report’s references to astronauts and alcohol use.

Unfortunately,  that  firestorm  has  all  but  eclipsed  what  to  me  are  some  of  the
most important findings in the report—namely, the findings that indicate that flight
surgeons  and  astronauts  have  faced  difficulties  in  getting  adequate  attention  paid
to medical and behavioral problems.

When I read statements in the report such as:

‘‘Many  anecdotes  were  related  that  involved  risky  behaviors  by  astronauts  that
were  well  known  to  the  other  astronauts  and  no  apparent  action  was  taken.
Peers and staff fear ostracism if they identify their own or other’s problems.’’
And ‘‘Instances were described where major crew medical or behavioral problems
were identified to astronaut leadership and the medical advice was disregarded.
This  disregard  was  described  as  ‘demoralizing’  to  the  point  where  they  are  less
likely to report concerns of performance decrement. . .’’

. . .those statements trouble me.
Getting  to  the  bottom  of  the  concerns  raised  by  the  panel  is  what  I  think  NASA
leadership needs to focus its attention on. And in getting to the bottom of those con-
cerns, I hope NASA will heed the advice contained in Col. Bachmann’s written testi-
mony:

‘‘NASA must ensure that people can identify such safety and human performance
concerns  within  NASA  without  fear  of  reprisal  or  career  injury.  Public  state-
ments  that  such  things  are  simply  impossible,  challenging  the  veracity  of  these

20

findings  rather  than  acknowledging  how  difficult  raising  such  concerns  can  be,
do not encourage openness and safety.’’

To  my  way  of  thinking—and  with  all  due  respect  to  Administrator  Griffin—dis-
paraging  a  finding  in  the  independent  review  panel’s  report  as  an  ‘‘urban  legend’’
doesn’t  do  much  to  encourage  that  needed  openness. . .especially  when  the  Chair
of  that  same  independent  panel  is  prepared  to  testify  that  the  finding  is  based  on
voluntary interviews with eyewitnesses to the incidents.

I hope NASA can move beyond such statements and instead turn its attention to
giving  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  Col.  Bachmann’s  panel  the  attention
that they deserve.

He  and  his  committee  have  done  NASA  and  the  Nation  a  service  in  identifying
a number of issues that need attention and in offering recommendations to improve
NASA’s astronaut health care system.

NASA certainly doesn’t have to agree with all of those findings and recommenda-

tions. But I hope that the agency will take them seriously.

We  all  recognize  the  bravery  and  dedication  of  the  Nation’s  astronauts.  We  need
to  do  our  part  to  ensure  that  we  give  them  the  best  astronaut  medical  and  behav-
ioral health care system possible.

Thank you, and I yield back my time.
Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon.  As  Mr.  Feeney
noted, the Ranking Member, Mr. Hall, is also present. I would like
to ask unanimous consent that he also be recognized for any open-
ing remarks he would care to make.

Without objection, so ordered.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  I  thank  you  for  doing
what  you  are  doing.  I  realize  that  you  had  to  do  it,  and  Bart  Gor-
don is a fine Chairman and great native Tennessean, and I admire
him very much, enjoy working with him.

But,  you  know,  I  am  so  pro-NASA  and  pro-space  and  pro-Mike
Griffin that it is just really something that, accusations sound more
to me like someone that is wanting to be quoted rather than some-
thing  that  might  have  happened  by  our  most  red,  white,  and  blue
members  of  public  service  at  any  stage  here.  Our  very  finest  edu-
cated  men  and  women  that  put  their  life  in  the  hands  of  those  of
us  who  light  the  stick  of  dynamite  that  sends  them  off.  Above  and
beyond  public  servants  and  I  hate  to  even  see  a  hearing  on  some-
thing  like  this,  but  I  understand  the  Chairman,  that  it  is  some-
thing when you have these allegations you have to hear it, and you
have to, it is best to clear the air, and I hope we can do that here.
I do want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for—and I thank the pan-
elists  for  being  here  today  to  speak  on  this  health  reports,  what  I
would like to look at it as is most of you know I have been a long-
time supporter of astronaut safety, and indeed, it has been my pri-
mary goal in relation to the U.S. space program. And I have argued
for  years  that  we  need  to  do  everything  we  can  to  insure  that  the
men  and  women  who  are  launched  into  outer  space  are  prepared
and  equipped  with  everything  they  need  to  do  the  job  and  return
to Earth safely. I believe this is also the goal of each and every per-
son working on the Shuttle program at NASA.

In  the  wake  of  the  Columbia  disaster,  Congress  held  a  series  of
investigations aimed at addressing the problems that led to the ac-
cident,  and  these  investigations  culminated  with  the  CAIB  report
that  outlined  suggestions  for  NASA.  So  I  know  that  Administrator
Griffin  and  his  team  have  taken  these  suggestions  seriously  and
have implemented a series of changes at NASA to address the con-
cerns.

I don’t look forward to the hearing, but I do look forward to stay-
ing  here  and  listening  to  the  testimony,  particularly  from  the  Ad-
ministrator  on  the  progress  of  these  changes  and  what  NASA  can
do  to  continue  to  improve  as  we  move  forward.  And  as  my  good
friend,  Representative  Feeney,  points  out,  we  need  to  continue  to
be  vigilant,  and  as  this  Chairman  is  going  to  do,  I  know  from
knowing him and his family before him that they will address prob-
lems  and  they  meet  problems  head  on  at  NASA  and  everywhere
else so that there is a culture of safety that prevails.

I  look  forward  to  the  hearing,  and  I  yield  back  my  time,  and  I

thank the Chair.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  Ranking  Member  for  his  always
insightful  remarks  and  look  forward  to  his  participation  further  in
the hearing.

If there are other Members who wish to submit additional open-

ing statements, your statements will be added to the record.

Without objection, so ordered.
At  this  time  I  would  like  to  turn  to  the  panel  and  recognize  our
first  panel  witnesses.  I  would  like  to  introduce  everybody  in  the
panel,  and  then  we  will  come  back  and  start  with  Colonel
Bachmann.  And  I  did  want  to  initially  introduce  Colonel  Richard
E.  Bachmann,  who  is  appearing  before  the  Subcommittee  today  in
his capacity as the Chair of the NASA Astronaut Health Care Sys-
tem Review Committee.

To  Colonel  Bachmann’s  left  is  Dr.  Richard  S.  Williams,  who  is
the Chief Health and Medical Officer at NASA. Further to the left
on the table is Dr. Ellen Ochoa, who is the Director of Flight Crew
Operations  at  NASA,  and  our  last  witness  on  the  first  panel  we
have  Mr.  Bryan  O’Connor,  the  Chief  of  Safety  and  Mission  Assur-
ance  at  NASA,  a  very  esteemed  and  highly-qualified  panel.  Wel-
come to all of you.

As  our  witnesses  should  know,  spoken  testimony  is  limited  to
five  minutes  each,  after  which  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  and
in this case the Full Committee will have five minutes each to ask
questions.

So  we  will  begin  with  Colonel  Bachmann.  Thank  you  for  being

here, and the floor is yours, Colonel.

Panel 1

STATEMENT  OF  COLONEL  RICHARD  E.  BACHMANN,  JR.,
CHAIR,  NASA  ASTRONAUT  HEALTH  CARE  SYSTEM  REVIEW
COMMITTEE;  COMMANDER  AND  DEAN  OF  THE  U.S.  AIR
FORCE SCHOOL OF AEROSPACE MEDICINE
Colonel BACHMANN. Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of
the Committee, good morning. It is truly an honor for me to speak
to  you  today  about  the  findings  of  the  NASA  Astronaut  Health
Care System Review Committee.

NASA chartered this committee and selected the members to re-
view the medical and behavioral health care that is provided to as-
tronauts, provide opinions as to what, if any, procedures or testing
could  be  put  in  place  to  predict  disordered  conduct  or  acts  of  pas-
sion. The entire report, each finding and recommendation, was ap-
proved and is supported unanimously by the entire committee.

22

The  work  of  further  evaluation  and  action  on  the  information
contained within the report falls to NASA. The committee reviewed
documents  and  conducted  interviews  of  behavioral  health  medical
professionals,  astronauts,  and  family  members.  Because  we  were
focused on systems issues rather than the behavior of specific indi-
viduals,  we  encouraged  NASA  personnel  to  speak  freely  and  as-
sured them that the report would not include any personally-identi-
fiable information.

As  the  review  progressed  it  became  apparent  that  major
vulnerabilities, underlying root causes, and contributing factors ex-
tend  well  beyond  the  specific  medical  aspects  of  NASA  operations.
The report’s most important issues and risks can be summarized
in  the  following  three  areas:  First,  NASA  personnel  feels  strongly
that  human  factors  concerns  are  disregarded  to  the  point  where
they are reluctant to identify such concerns in the future.

Second,  the  supervisors,  peers,  and  other  NASA  personnel  must

be empowered and expected to enforce standards of conduct.

And third, that medical and behavioral health services should be
integrated  and  focused  on  astronaut  performance  enhancement.
The perceived disregard of human factors concerns has the greatest
safety implications and demands immediate attention.

Unfortunately,  a  disproportioned  amount  of  attention  has  been
focused on astronaut alcohol use. Separately, NASA astronauts and
medical  personnel  describe  two  specific  instances  of  alcohol  use  to
the committee as examples of a much larger issue. The NASA per-
sonnel  felt  that  human  factors  concerns  with  significant  safety  im-
plications had been disregarded when raised to local on-scene lead-
ership.

The  interviewees  were  eyewitnesses  to  the  events  and  provided
the  information  voluntarily  and  unprompted  to  the  committee.  We
wish  to  emphasize  again  that  the  specifics  of  the  incidents  should
not be the focus of the attention. The general sense of disregard for
human factors described as demoralizing to the point where NASA
personnel  are  less  likely  to  report  concerns  of  performance  decre-
ment is the fundamental concern NASA must investigate and rem-
edy.

We  understand  the  outrage  that  some  members  of  NASA  have
expressed  at  this  particular  finding.  However,  public  statements
that  such  things  are  simply  impossible,  challenging  the  veracity  of
the  findings,  referring  to  them  as  unproven  allegations  or  urban
legends  rather  than  acknowledging  how  difficult  raising  such  con-
cerns  can  be,  do  not  encourage  openness  and  safety,  make  future
reporting  even  less  likely,  and  increase  the  risk  of  future  mishaps
or incidents.

The  recently-released  NASA  space  flight  safety  review  did  not
prove  that  the  evidence  described  to  us  did  not  happen,  only  that
NASA  personnel  who  shared  their  concerns  with  the  committee
during  the  interviews  did  not  bring  these  same  concerns  forward
during  the  safety  review.  We  believe  this  may  represent  continued
fear and barriers to communication and may be a cause for greater,
not less, concern.

The  committee  identified  a  number  of  structural  and  cultural
issues  that  currently  exist  in  NASA  that  make  it  even  more  dif-
ficult  to  predict  an  episode  of  disordered  conduct  and  made  rec-

ommendations to ameliorate them. These recommendations include
instituting  a  formal  written  code  of  conduct,  creating  enduring  su-
pervisory mentoring relationships with effective feedback and eval-
uation,  and  empowering  supervisors,  peers,  and  support  staff  to
bring forward concerns.

Solutions  will  require  a  systems-based  approach.  NASA  has  ac-
knowledged  the  intent  to  act  upon  most,  if  not  all,  of  these  rec-
ommendations. Each finding and recommendation should be explic-
itly addressed and tracked to resolution with both internal and ex-
ternal oversight.

We  believe  the  first  and  most  important  step  that  needs  to  be
taken by NASA is to conduct a thorough, appropriately-constructed,
anonymous  survey  of  the  relevant  populations  covered  by  this  re-
port. This survey must be carefully worded in order to obtain valid,
actionable information. NASA senior leadership must provide vocal
support  for  the  survey  and  encourage  NASA  personnel  to  be  open,
honest, and thorough in their replies. They must be assured of ano-
nymity,  freedom  from  reprisal,  and  that  the  information  will  be
used  appropriately.  Otherwise  the  concerns  will  be  driven  further
underground.

Only  with  such  a  comprehensive,  anonymous,  valid,  and  visibly-
supported survey can NASA truly determine the scope of the prob-
lems and drive toward system solutions.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF COLONEL RICHARD E. BACHMANN, JR.

Mr.  Chairman,  Honorable  Members  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee,

good afternoon.

My  name  is  Colonel  Richard  Bachmann.  I  am  the  Chairman  of  the  NASA  Astro-
naut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee.  This  committee  was  chartered  by
NASA  in  February  2007  to  conduct  a  review  of  the  medical  and  behavioral  health
care  provided  to  astronauts  and  to  provide  opinions  as  to  what,  if  any,  procedures
or testing could be put in place to predict disordered conduct or acts of passion.

In  order  to  accomplish  this  review,  the  NASA  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer
contacted the senior medical officers of various federal agencies, such as the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration,  and  solicited  nominations  of  ‘‘appropriately  credentialed  physicians
and mental health professionals, employed by the Federal Government or on active
duty in the military services, and experienced in medical and behavioral health sup-
port  to  organizations  and  personnel  engaged  in  critical  or  hazardous  operations.’’
The  NASA  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer  selected  the  committee  members  from
the  pool  of  nominees  based  on  professional  credentials,  operational  experience  and
availability. Assignment and notification to the committee members occurred in late
February 2007.

I was asked by the NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer to serve as Chairman.
I am an Air Force flight surgeon, specialist in Aerospace and Occupational Medicine,
and  until  last  week,  I  was  the  Commander  and  Dean  of  the  US  Air  Force  School
of  Aerospace  Medicine.  I  am  now  the  Special  Assistant  to  the  Air  Force  Research
Laboratory  Commander,  and  the  new  Commander  of  the  US  Air  Force  School  of
Aerospace Medicine works for me.

The committee members are as follows:

Colonel  Timothy  Sowin,  Air  Force  flight  surgeon,  specialist  in  both  psychiatry
and  aerospace  medicine,  and 
the  Aviation
Neuropsychiatry branch at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.
Colonel James Bagian, Air Force Reserve flight surgeon, specialist in aerospace
medicine, former NASA astronaut-physician, and currently Chief Patient Safety
Officer, Department of Veterans Affairs.

Mark Bauer, specialist in psychiatry, Professor of Psychiatry, Brown University
and Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
James Fraser, Captain U.S. Navy retired, specialist in aerospace medicine, cur-
rently Deputy Federal Air Surgeon, Federal Aviation Administration.
Sandra  Yerkes,  Captain  U.S.  Navy  retired,  specialist  in  psychiatry,  currently
Director, NAVMED Medical Accessions.
Elizabeth Holmes, Captain U.S. Navy retired, clinical psychologist, currently on
faculty at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership.
Paul DeLaney, Captain U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General Corps, currently as-
signed  to  the  U.S.  Navy  Chief  of  Staff,  Office  of  the  Judge  Advocate  General.

Ex officio members of the committee are:

James  Duncan,  NASA  Chief  of  Space  Medicine  Operations  at  Johnson  Space
Center
Wayne Frazier, NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance

Consultant—Ellen Baker, current NASA astronaut physician
Executive  Secretary—John  Allen,  NASA  Program  Executive,  Crew  Health  and

Safety.

The committee members were nominated by their respective federal agencies and
selected  by  NASA  because  of  their  diverse  backgrounds,  extensive  experience,  and
professional  credentials.  The  committee’s  overarching  goal  is  to  enhance  the  ability
of  NASA  to  perform  its  mission  safely  and  effectively.  All  the  members  of  the  com-
mittee  feel  greatly  honored  to  have  been  selected  for  this  task,  and  look  upon  it  as
a civic duty to the Nation.

It  is  important  to  reiterate  that  the  committee’s  findings,  recommendations  and
opinions  provided  to  NASA  in  this  report  do  not  reflect  the  official  positions  of  the
Air Force, Navy, Department of Defense, FAA, or VA. The committee was called into
being by NASA to provide this report, and with the delivery of the report, the com-
mittee’s  mission  is  complete.  The  committee  members  will  continue  to  be  available
to  NASA  to  provide  clarification  or  explanation  on  the  report  itself,  but  the  work
of  further  evaluation,  deliberation  and  action  on  the  information  contained  in  the
report falls to NASA. The committee was not intended to provide ongoing oversight
or assess NASA’s response to any issues raised in the report.

Our  task  was  to  identify  potential  vulnerabilities  in  NASA’s  medical  and  behav-
ioral health system and to recommend to NASA potential corrective actions or areas
requiring further study.

The  committee  convened  for  its  first  meeting  at  NASA  Headquarters  in  Wash-
ington, DC, on March 28, 2007 and received informational briefings from a wide va-
riety  of  NASA  functional  experts.  NASA  provided  the  committee  with  an  extensive
set of policy documents and reports for review and future reference.

After several weeks of document review, research and meetings via teleconference,
the committee met at Johnson Space Center from 23 to 26 April, 2007. During this
period, Johnson Space Center personnel presented informational briefings and were
interviewed  by  the  committee.  Then  the  committee  divided  into  small  teams  and
conducted  on-site  reviews  throughout  the  medical  and  behavioral  health  areas.
These  reviews  consisted  of  document  reviews  and  interviews  with  individuals  and
groups. NASA astronaut, medical and family support office personnel assisted in so-
liciting  astronauts  and  family  member  volunteers  to  be  interviewed  by  the  com-
mittee.  During  the  interviews,  NASA  personnel  were  encouraged  to  speak  freely,
and  were  assured  that  no  personally  identifiable  information  would  be  included  in
the  report.  Although  the  astronauts  and  family  members  interviewed  do  not  rep-
resent  a  random  or  exhaustive  sample  of  the  larger  population,  the  issues  they
raised  during  these  unstructured  interviews  were  remarkably  consistent  and  com-
pelling and deserve focused action.

The  committee  members  met  at  the  end  of  each  day  and  reviewed  their  findings
and  observations  with  the  entire  committee.  After  the  committee’s  departure  from
Johnson  Space  Center,  astronauts  and  family  members  continued  to  contact  and
were interviewed by individual committee members.

Following  the  visit  to  JSC  and  subsequent  interviews,  each  committee  member
wrote up his or her findings and recommendations and shared them with the entire
committee  via  e-mail  and  telephonic  discussions.  The  NASA  astronaut  advisor  and
ex-officio  members  of  the  committee  were  not  included  in  the  development  of  find-
ings and recommendations, but were available to the committee to answer questions
regarding  NASA  policies  and  procedures.  The  committee  gathered  at  the  U.S.  Air

Force  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine  from  30–31  May  to  draft  the  report.  The  com-
mittee  decided  to  organize  the  report’s  findings  and  recommendations  according  to
the  specific  questions  given  to  the  committee  by  the  NASA  CHMO  at  our  initial
formative meeting.

Each member was free to determine the level of significance required for any par-
ticular piece of information to be considered a finding. Each member’s proposed find-
ings  and  recommendations  were  grouped  under  the  appropriate  subject  area  and
combined whenever possible. Each finding and recommendation was considered, dis-
cussed and carefully written to ensure significance, validity and clarity. The commit-
tee’s  criteria  for  a  finding  to  be  included  in  the  report  were  based  on  whether  the
finding  addressed  a  specific  question  NASA  asked  the  committee  to  evaluate,  and/
or  whether  the  issue  identified  significant  concerns  regarding  astronaut  health,
flight safety or mission completion. During the initial phase of deliberations, we rec-
ognized  that  dissenting  opinions  might  arise  and  allowed  for  a  minority  report  to
be  included,  but  this  proved  to  be  unnecessary.  The  entire  report,  all  findings  and
recommendations, were approved unanimously by the entire committee.

Work  continued  on  the  final  wording  for  the  next  few  weeks,  with  each  proposed
refinement  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  entire  committee.  A  draft  of  the  report
was  provided  to  NASA  on  June  21st  for  correction  of  any  factual  errors  and  we  re-
ceived  their  response  on  July  3rd.  The  committee  formally  presented  the  findings
and  recommendations  to  the  NASA  Administrator  and  senior  NASA  staff  on  July
16th.  After  some  very  minor  revisions  to  provide  additional  clarity,  the  report  was
finalized and delivered to NASA on July 25th. NASA released the report to the pub-
lic in concert with a news conference on July 27th.

The  committee  received  outstanding  support  from  NASA  at  every  level  of  the  or-
ganization.  It  was  clear  from  every  interview  that  NASA  personnel  are  dedicated
to accomplishing their mission—the interviews were characterized by openness, hon-
esty,  cooperation  and  a  palpable  desire  to  make  things  better.  As  the  review  pro-
gressed,  it  became  apparent  that  major  vulnerabilities,  underlying  root  causes  and
contributing  factors  extend  well  beyond  the  specific  medical  aspects  of  NASA  oper-
ations.  Many  of  the  cultural  and  structural  issues  identified  in  the  report  have  ex-
isted  for  many  years,  pre-dating  the  current  leadership  team,  are  deeply  ingrained
and will take senior leadership action to remediate them.

The committee concluded that NASA’s astronaut health care system provides eas-
ily  accessible  services  to  astronauts  and  their  families,  which  were  consistent  with
accepted  standards  of  care.  There  is  room  for  improvement  in  the  provision  of  be-
havioral  health  services,  particularly  in  selection,  training,  evaluation  and  support
of astronauts preparing for and participating in space missions. The medical and be-
havioral  health  systems  could  be  better  integrated  and  focused  on  astronaut  per-
formance enhancement.

During the interviews, members of the NASA medical and astronaut communities
raised  significant  concerns  regarding  barriers  to  communication.  As  examples  of
these  barriers  to  communication,  they  described  instances  where  medical  personnel
or  fellow  astronauts  raised  concerns  about  an  astronaut’s  fitness  for  flight  due  to
alcohol use in the immediate pre-flight period, and these concerns appeared to them
to be disregarded or overridden. The committee is very concerned about this percep-
tion  of  disregard  for  human  factors  inputs,  and  strongly  recommends  that  NASA
conduct further evaluation using tools such as anonymous surveys, to determine the
extent  of  such  perceptions,  and  ensure  that  human  factors  concerns  are  appro-
priately identified and dealt with.

Unfortunately,  since  the  release  of  the  committee’s  report,  a  disproportionate
amount  of  media  attention  has  been  focused  on  the  section  of  the  report  discussing
specific incidents of astronauts and alcohol use. In separate interviews, NASA astro-
naut  and  medical  personnel  described  two  specific  instances  of  alcohol  use  to  the
committee  as  examples  of  a  much  larger  issue:  that  NASA  personnel  felt  that
human  factors  concerns  with  significant  safety  implications  had  been  disregarded
when  raised  to  local  on-scene  leadership.  These  incidents  were  described  by  eye-
witnesses  to  the  events,  and  were  provided  voluntarily  and  unprompted  by  NASA
personnel  to  the  committee.  In  order  to  encourage  them  to  speak  freely,  the  com-
mittee  assured  the  interviewees  that  we  would  make  every  effort  to  keep  names,
dates  and  other  specifics  out  of  our  notes  and  out  of  the  report.  The  general  sense
of  disregard  for  human  factors,  described  as  ‘‘demoralizing’’  to  the  point  where
NASA personnel are less likely to report concerns of performance decrement, is the
fundamental concern NASA must investigate and address.

We  understand  the  outrage  that  some  members  of  NASA  have  expressed  at  this
particular  finding.  The  fact  remains  that  the  incidents  described  in  the  report  that
have  generated  so  much  concern  and  anger  were  told  to  the  committee  voluntarily
by  NASA  personnel  who  were  eyewitnesses  to  the  incidents.  NASA  must  ensure

that people can identify such safety and human performance concerns within NASA
without fear of reprisal or career injury. Public statements that such things are sim-
ply impossible, challenging the veracity of these findings rather than acknowledging
how  difficult  raising  such  concerns  can  be,  do  not  encourage  openness  and  safety.
Human  behavior  is  complex.  Prediction  of  future  behavior,  even  by  behavioral
health  experts,  is  extremely  difficult  to  perform  accurately.  Systemic  procedures
alone  cannot  predict  disordered  conduct,  but  human  factors  concerns  or  issues  that
arise or are identified in one realm could be more effectively shared with others and
potentially  result  in  earlier  intervention.  The  committee  identified  a  number  of
structural and cultural issues that currently exist in NASA that make it even more
difficult  to  predict  an  episode  of  disordered  conduct,  and  made  recommendations  to
ameliorate them. These recommendations include instituting a formal, written code
of  conduct,  creating  enduring  supervisory/mentoring  relationships  with  effective
feedback  and  evaluation,  and  empowering  supervisors,  peers  and  support  staff  to
bring  forward  concerns.  Using  similar  processes,  organizations  as  diverse  as  the
military,  the  FAA  and  the  VA  have  made  great  progress,  with  active  supervisory
and peer involvement, in changing cultural attitudes towards safety, accountability,
empowerment and alcohol.

This report contains a wide range of findings and recommendations. Some of these
recommendations  will  be  relatively  simple  to  implement,  such  as  writing  standard
operating  procedures  to  document  processes,  which  are  already  in  place.  Some  will
take  substantially  more  time  and  effort  to  implement,  such  as  restructuring  astro-
naut  supervisory  relationships  or  focusing  the  attention  of  psychologists  on  astro-
naut  performance  enhancement.  Some  recommendations  entail  changing  deep  seat-
ed, long standing aspects of astronaut, flight surgeon and safety cultures regarding
alcohol  use,  code  of  conduct,  acknowledgement  of  human  performance  issues,  selec-
tion, training, evaluation and professional development, communication and privacy.
None of these issues lend themselves to easy analysis or correction of a single factor.
All  of  them  require  further  study  and  evaluation  by  NASA.  Solutions  will  require
a systems-based approach and will take time to achieve.

We  believe  the  three  most  important  issues  and  risks  in  this  report  can  be  sum-
marized  in  the  following  areas:  First,  NASA  personnel’s  sense  that  human  factors
concerns  are  disregarded  and  that  this  has  made  them  reluctant  to  identify  such
concerns  in  the  future:  second,  that  supervisors,  peers  and  other  NASA  personnel
must  be  empowered  and  expected  to  enforce  standards  of  conduct;  and  third,  that
medical  and  behavioral  health  services  should  be  integrated  and  focused  on  astro-
naut  performance  enhancement.  The  issue  of  perceived  disregard  of  human  factors
concerns is by far the most worrisome and demanding of immediate attention.

To  restate,  the  committee  believes  the  first  and  most  important  step  that  needs
to  be  taken  by  the  NASA  senior  leadership  is  to  conduct  a  thorough,  anonymous
survey of the relevant NASA populations covered by this report—medical personnel,
astronauts, and training personnel. This survey should be carefully worded in order
to obtain valid, actionable information. NASA senior leadership should provide vocal
support for the survey and encourage NASA personnel to be open, honest and thor-
ough  in  their  replies.  They  must  be  assured  of  anonymity,  freedom  from  reprisal
and  that  the  information  will  be  used  appropriately,  otherwise  the  concerns  will  be
driven  further  underground.  The  committee’s  report  identified  many  areas  of  con-
cern  to  NASA—only  with  such  a  comprehensive,  anonymous,  valid  and  visibly-sup-
ported survey can NASA determine the scope of the problems and drive toward sys-
tems solutions.

The committee appreciates the openness of and the assistance provided by NASA
leadership,  astronauts,  medical  personnel  and  family  members.  They  clearly  share
the  overarching  goal  of  the  committee—to  enhance  the  ability  of  NASA  to  perform
its mission safely and effectively.

Thank you.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RICHARD  S.  WILLIAMS,  CHIEF  HEALTH
AND  MEDICAL  OFFICER,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND
SPACE ADMINISTRATION
Dr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee,
thank you for the opportunity to appear today to discuss the NASA
Astronaut  Medical  and  Behavioral  Health  Care  Program.  I  am
pleased  to  provide  you  with  insight  into  this  comprehensive  pro-
gram and discuss our plans regarding the findings of the NASA As-
tronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  and  the  internal
review conducted at Johnson Space Center.

The  NASA  Astronaut  Medical  Behavioral  Health  Care  Program
has succeeded in keeping our astronauts healthy and ready to per-
form  the  challenging  tasks  that  NASA  asks  of  them.  Over  the
course  of  our  nation’s  40-year  human  space  flight  endeavor,  the
health  care  system  has  contributed  to  the  success  of  all  NASA
human  space  flight  missions.  No  mission  has  thus  far  been  abbre-
viated  or  terminated  because  of  a  health  care  issue.  Longer  dura-
tion  exploration  missions  will  provide  new  challenges,  and  we  are
committed  to  ensuring  our  program  continues  to  provide  the  best
medical and behavioral health care.

The  health  related  recommendations  of  the  Astronaut  Health
Care System Review Committee are thoughtful and will contribute
to  meeting  the  behavioral  health  challenges  that  lie  ahead.  I  take
the  recommendations  of  the  review  committee  seriously,  and  we
thank  the  committee  for  all  the  time  and  effort  involved  in  their
study.  Our  overarching  goal  is  to  improve  behavioral  health  and
medical care for the astronauts.

Several  of  the  committee  recommendations  were  accepted  imme-
diately,  and  many  more  will  be  accepted  in  the  coming  months.
Specifically,  NASA  accepts  the  recommendations  concerning  anal-
ysis  and  use  of  behavioral  health  data  and  will  convene  experts  to
address psychological testing as recommended.

Briefings  by  the  flight  surgeons  to  crew  members  concerning
medical  monitoring  activities  and  briefings  by  principle  investiga-
tors  concerning  research  data  collection  and  the  context  of  obtain-
ing  informed  consent  will  be  re-emphasized.  Effective  communica-
tion  between  astronauts  and  flight  surgeons  will  be  addressed.  We
will ensure both groups are aware of the multiple pathways to com-
municate  safety  and  health  concerns,  and  we  will  be  working  to-
gether in support of NASA senior leadership to reinforce these con-
cepts.

Flight  surgeon  scheduling  and  task  assignment  and  flight  medi-
cine  clinic  operations  will  be  closely  examined  with  the  goal  of  en-
hancing  continuity  of  care  to  the  greatest  extent  feasible.  Options
for  providing  effective  behavioral  health  services  to  all  flight  as-
signable  astronauts  for  the  purposes  of  performing  enhancement,
performance  enhancement  will  be  reviewed,  and  a  behavioral
health  assessment  will  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  annual  astro-
naut  physical  examination.  Options  for  flight  surgeon  behavioral
health assessment training will also be identified.

A  common  credentialing  and  privileging  process  will  be  applied
to  behavioral  health  and  aeromedical  services,  and  a  peer  review
of  practice  will  be  enhanced  for  both.  NASA’s  electronic  medical
records  system  will  be  reexamined  to  provide  maximum  privacy
consistent  with  safe  medical  practice  in  compliance  with  all  appli-
cable statutes and regulation governing privacy of medical informa-
tion will be assured.

Process  linkages  between  the  behavioral  health  records  system
and the electronic medical record will be reviewed and established,
and  all  appropriately-credentialed  and  privileged  practitioners  will
be  granted  records  access  as  appropriate.  NASA  will  examine  op-
tions  for  assuring  quality  of  care  delivered  by  community  consult-
ants  and  practitioners.  Written  operational  instructions  and  proce-
dures  for  the  behavioral  health  clinic  will  be  examined  and  en-
hanced as appropriate.

The  Aerospace  Medicine  Board  charter  will  be  reviewed  and  up-
dated  to  reflect  appropriate  membership,  authority,  and  account-
ability.  Regular  meetings  will  be  scheduled  between  behavioral
health staff and flight surgeons to enhance clinical communication.
Our  initial  responses  to  the  committee’s  recommendation  were
reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  NASA  Medical  Policy  Board  on  Au-
gust  21,  2007.  The  Medical  Policy  Board  consisting  of  medical  ex-
perts  both  external  and  internal  to  NASA  is  available  to  me  for
consultation on all NASA and medical policy.

The  Medical  Policy  Board  will  provide  ongoing  implementation
oversight, and I will provide progress reports to the NASA Admin-
istrator.

Commitment to flight safety remains the foundation of our effort,
and  we  look  forward  to  system  improvements  that  will  be  realized
as a result of this report.

I  look  forward  to  answering  any  questions  you  may  have  this

morning.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD S. WILLIAMS

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  appear  today  to  discuss  the  NASA  Astronaut  Medical  and  Behavioral  Health
Care Program. I am privileged to serve as the NASA Chief Health and Medical Offi-
cer.  The  Office  of  the  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer  was  established  as  a  new
office  in  2000  based  on  the  recommendations  of  external  advisory  groups.  The  pur-
pose  was  to  provide  an  expanded  oversight  and  policy  role  for  the  NASA’s  health
care  system.  I  am  pleased  to  provide  you  with  insight  into  NASA’s  comprehensive
health care system and discuss our plans regarding the findings of the NASA Astro-
naut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  and  the  internal  review  conducted  at
Johnson Space Center (JSC).

Over the last two decades, the Johnson Space Center Space Medicine Division has
developed  an  excellent  relationship  with  the  astronauts  through  astronaut  and
flight  surgeon  cooperation.  The  NASA  Astronaut  Medical  and  Behavioral  Health
Care  program  has  succeeded  in  keeping  our  astronauts  healthy  and  ready  to  per-
form the challenging tasks that NASA asks of them. Over the course of our nation’s
40-year human space flight endeavor, the health care system has contributed to the
success  of  all  NASA  human  space  flight  missions.  No  NASA  mission  has  thus  far
been shortened or terminated because of a health care issue. Longer-duration explo-
ration  missions  will  provide  new  challenges  and  we  are  committed  to  ensuring  our
program continues to provide the best medical and behavioral health care to the As-
tronaut  Corps.  The  health-related  recommendations  of  the  Astronaut  Health  Care
System Review Committee are thoughtful and will contribute to meeting the behav-
ioral health challenges that lie ahead.
NASA Astronaut Medical and Behavioral Health Care Program

The  NASA  Astronaut  Medical,  Dental,  and  Behavioral  Health  Care  program  was
established  almost  50  years  ago  by  NASA  to  ensure  the  health  and  well  being  of
astronauts  and  their  dependents.  The  program  provides  a  comprehensive  health
care  system  for  astronauts.  Health  care  services  are  provided  to  ensure  that  astro-
nauts meet established human health standards in support of mission needs.

Policy  governing  astronaut  medical  and  behavioral  health  is  set  by  NASA  Head-
quarters.  My  office,  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer  (OCHMO),
is responsible for establishing policy and providing oversight of all NASA health and
medical operations. The Johnson Space Center is responsible for management of all
NASA space medical activities in support of human space flight. Astronauts and de-
pendents  have  traditionally  received  health  care  services  at  the  NASA  Johnson
Space  Center  Flight  Medicine  Clinic  that  included  medical  and  dental  care,  as  well
as  psychiatric  and  psychological  services.  As  the  focus  of  space  flight  changed  to
longer-duration  missions,  a  separate  behavioral  clinic  was  established  and  behav-
ioral  health  support  was  added  to  the  pre-,  in  and  post-flight  support  of  astronauts
flying on the International Space Station (ISS) and their families.

The Astronaut Medical, Dental and Behavioral Health Care program has evolved
over time to meet changing mission needs and has incorporated enhancements that
were a direct result of internal and external review. Notably, the Institute of Medi-
cine (IOM) released a report in 2001 entitled ‘‘Safe Passage, Astronaut Care for Ex-
ploration Mission.’’ This report led NASA to adopt an occupational health model for
the health care of astronauts.

The findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) had an impor-
tant impact on the NASA culture and this certainly touched the health care system.
A governance structure including independent technical authorities was established
to set technical standards and assure programmatic adherence to technical require-
ments. The Health and Medical Technical Authority was established in 2006 to take
responsibility for health and medical program requirements and standards, and en-
sure  NASA  program  compliance  with  them.  The  Health  and  Medical  Technical  Au-
thority  also  provides  a  path  for  issues  and  concerns  to  be  raised  relating  to  crew
health issues, and works very well with our occupational health model for astronaut
health care delivery.
Roles, Responsibilities and Decision-making

Flight surgeons in the Space Medicine Division provide medical care to the astro-
nauts  utilizing  the  Flight  Medicine  Clinic  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center.  Primary
medical  care  and  annual  physical  examinations  for  aeromedical  certification  for
space flight are performed by the flight surgeons. Medical conditions may arise that
necessitate  referral  or  consultation  with  external  expert  practitioners.  Conditions
that  violate  an  established  medical  standard  may  require  that  an  astronaut  be  rel-
egated to duties not involving flying (DNIF) until the condition resolves. This is re-
ferred to as ‘‘grounding’’ an astronaut. Flight surgeons have the authority to ground

31

astronauts  who  have  developed  health  conditions  that  prevent  them  from  meeting
medical  standards.  Any  grounding  decision  is  reviewed  by  the  Chief  of  the  Flight
Medicine Clinic (FMC), and the Chair of the Aerospace Medicine Board (AMB), who
must provide concurrence.

Waivers  may  be  granted  for  many  medical  conditions  if  they  are  deemed  stable
and  of  no  significance  to  the  mission.  Medical  waivers  must  be  based  on  best  med-
ical  evidence  and  professional  opinion  and  supported  by  sound  aeromedical  ration-
ale. All cases for medical waiver consideration are reviewed by the Aerospace Medi-
cine  Board.  In  the  case  of  permanent  waivers,  a  recommendation  is  forwarded  to
me  for  review  and  disposition.  The  NASA  Medical  Policy  Board  (MPB),  consisting
of internal and external medical experts, is available to me for consultation on waiv-
er decisions as well as all NASA medical policy matters.

Behavioral health specialists have been primarily responsible for evaluation of as-
tronaut  candidates  for  selection  and  for  support  of  long-duration  space  flight  astro-
nauts  and  their  family  members.  Astronauts  are  evaluated  by  psychiatrists  or  psy-
chologists  and  are  provided  education  and  training  on  the  rigors  of  long-duration
space  flight  and  confinement.  This  training  enables  the  astronaut  to  recognize  per-
sonal  reactions  to  the  isolated  environment  and  aids  the  astronaut  in  maximizing
performance  and  mission  success.  Counseling  and  therapy  services  are  provided
upon  request  to  all  astronauts  and  to  all  dependents.  Behavioral  health  providers
have the same authority to ground an astronaut (issue a DNIF status) and to bring
a case to the AMB for evaluation and recommendation for waiver or disqualification.
Any  astronaut  wishing  to  contest  a  flight  surgeon  grounding  decision  can  appeal
to the Chief, Flight Medicine Clinic, or the Chief, Space Medicine Division. The ap-
peal  is  reviewed  by  the  Aerospace  Medicine  Board  with  a  recommendation  for-
warded  to  me  as  indicated.  Appeals  can  be  raised  directly  to  my  attention  by  the
astronaut for review and final decision.

Medical issues that arise immediately pre-flight or in-flight are discussed between
operational,  medical,  and  astronaut  management  authorities  on  a  need-to-know
basis giving due consideration to privacy, crew member health and safety, and mis-
sion  impact.  The  Agency  governance  structure  provides  a  path  for  dissenting  opin-
ions to be raised through the Health and Medical Technical Authority chain of com-
mand.

I  made  earlier  reference  to  medical  standards.  They  are  defined  to  establish  fit-
ness for flight and fitness for duty. Under the leadership of the Space Medicine Divi-
sion  of  the  Space  Life  Sciences  Directorate  at  the  NASA  Johnson  Space  Center,
standards  are  developed  by  teams  of  experts  in  various  fields  of  clinical  medicine
and aerospace medicine. The standards are reviewed and approved by the Aerospace
Medicine  Board  at  the  NASA  Johnson  Space  Center.  The  standards  are  then  sub-
mitted  to  the  OCHMO  at  NASA  Headquarters,  which  authorizes  a  review  by  the
Medical  Policy  Board  (MPB)  and  final  approval  is  granted  for  implementation.
These standards were first developed in 1978 and have undergone several revisions
since that time. The most recent revision was completed in July 2007.
Internal and External Review of Medical Practice

Biennial internal audits of the Flight Medicine Clinic are performed by my office.
The objective of these audits is to review clinical practice, record-keeping, and com-
pliance  with  applicable  regulations.  The  most  recent  audit  was  conducted  February
5–9,  2007.  The  findings  of  this  review  cited  a  number  of  Flight  Medicine  Clinic
(FMC) practices as Agency Best Practices.

In  addition,  quarterly  self-evaluations  are  performed  to  review  standards  of  care,
medical record documentation, and adherence to clinic policies and procedures. Doc-
umentation  deficiencies  that  are  identified  are  reviewed  and  corrected.  In  addition,
the  Chief  of  the  Flight  Medicine  Clinic  reviews  all  physical  examinations  for  accu-
racy, consistency, and adherence to established policies.

External  review  of  our  behavioral  medicine  services  was  performed  in  February
2007. This review determined that NASA provided a competent group of behavioral
health  providers  (BHP)  rendering  excellent  clinical  and  occupational  care.  Rec-
ommendations  were  also  made  for  improvement,  and  actions  were  in  place  to  ad-
dress many of these areas at the time of Dr. Bachmann’s review. These actions spe-
cifically  included  credentialing  of  NASA  BHP  providers,  privileging  of  BHP  pro-
viders by the FMC, plans for external consultant peer review biannually by an aero-
space psychiatry consultant, and implementation of a formalized, quarterly, internal
peer review process.
Summary

NASA  takes  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  seriously,  and  we  thank  the
Committee  for  all  the  time  and  effort  involved  in  their  study.  We  are  evaluating

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

each  recommendation  and  are  in  the  early  planning  stages  of  responding  to  them.
This  task  is  made  more  difficult  by  the  anecdotal  nature  of  some  of  the  findings  of
the  report.  Our  overarching  goal  is  to  improve  behavioral  health  and  medical  care
for the astronauts. Several of the Committee recommendations were accepted imme-
diately, and many more will be accepted in the coming months.

Specifically,  NASA  accepts  the  recommendations  concerning  analysis  and  use  of
behavioral health data, and will convene experts to address psychological testing as
recommended. Briefings by the flight surgeons to crew members concerning medical
monitoring  activities  and  briefings  by  principal  investigators  concerning  research
data  collection,  in  the  context  of  obtaining  informed  consent,  will  be  reemphasized.
Effective  communication  between  astronauts  and  flight  surgeons  will  be  addressed;
we  will  ensure  both  groups  are  aware  of  the  multiple  pathways  to  communicate
safety  and  health  concerns;  and  we  will  be  working  together  in  support  of  NASA
senior leadership to reinforce these concepts. Flight surgeon scheduling and task as-
signment  and  flight  medicine  clinic  operations  will  be  closely  examined,  with  the
goal of enhancing continuity of care to the greatest extent feasible. Options for pro-
viding effective behavioral health services to all flight assignable astronauts for the
purposes of performance enhancement will be reviewed, and a behavioral health as-
sessment  will  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  annual  astronaut  physical  examination.
Options  for  flight  surgeon  behavioral  health  assessment  training  will  also  be  de-
fined.

A  common  credentialing  and  privileging  process  will  be  applied  to  behavioral
health  and  aeromedical  services,  and  peer  review  of  practice  will  be  enhanced  for
both. NASA’s electronic medical records system will be re-examined to provide max-
imum privacy consistent with safe medical practice, and compliance with all applica-
ble  statutes  and  regulations  governing  privacy  of  medical  information  will  be  as-
sured. Process linkages between the behavioral health records system and the elec-
tronic  medical  record  will  be  reviewed  and  established,  and  all  appropriately
credentialed  and  privileged  practitioners  will  be  granted  records  access  as  appro-
priate. NASA will examine options for assuring quality of care delivered by commu-
nity  consultants  and  practitioners.  Written  operational  instructions  and  procedures
for the behavioral health clinic will be examined and enhanced as appropriate. The
Aerospace  Medicine  Board  charter  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  to  reflect  appro-
priate  membership,  authority  and  accountability,  and  regular  meetings  will  be
scheduled  between  behavioral  health  staff  and  flight  surgeons  to  enhance  clinical
communication.

These  initial  responses  were  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  Medical  Policy  Board
on August 21, 2007. The Medical Policy Board will provide ongoing implementation
oversight.  I  will  continue  to  coordinate  and  provide  feedback  to  the  Office  of  Safety
and Mission Assurance and the Flight Crew Operations Directorate at the Johnson
Space  Center.  Together  we  will  provide  regular  progress  reports  to  the  NASA  Ad-
ministrator.

Commitment to the health and welfare of the astronauts and all NASA employees
and to flight safety remains the foundation of our effort, and we look forward to sys-
tem improvements that will be realized as a result of this report.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Williams.
Dr. Ochoa, the floor is yours for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF DR. ELLEN OCHOA, DIRECTOR, FLIGHT CREW

OPERATIONS, NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER

Dr. OCHOA. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and Mem-
bers of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear
before you today.

I  have  the  privilege  of  managing  the  organization  that  includes
the Astronaut Office and the Aircraft Operations Division at NASA
Johnson  Space  Center.  Prior  to  becoming  Director  of  Flight  Crew
Operations  a  year  ago  and  Deputy  Director  four  years  before  that
I was a member of the astronaut office for 12 years and was fortu-
nate enough to fly on four Space Shuttle missions.

In  my  experience,  astronauts  prepare  thoroughly  and  uncompro-
misingly  for  their  missions.  One  of  my  crew  mates  compared  it  to
preparing  for  the  Olympics.  Every  act,  every  day  is  designed  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

33

make sure that you are at your peak, both mentally and physically,
when you launch into space.

About  10  years  ago  as  we  began  assembly  of  the  International
Space  Station,  it  became  clear  that  astronaut  preparation  needed
to  be  raised  to  a  new  level  to  accomplish  the  increased  complexity
of  establishing  and  maintaining  a  permanent  human  presence  in
space.  Along  with  the  Missions  Operations  Directorate,  whose  job
is  to  plan,  train,  and  fly  missions,  and  the  Space  Life  Sciences  Di-
rectorate, who insures the crew health, the Flight Crew Operations
Directorate developed new processes, training, evaluation methods,
and  fitness  standards  to  meet  the  challenge  of  assembling  and  op-
erating the Space Station.

Standards  for  fitness  for  duty  are  determined,  measured,  and
documented using a number of processes and tools. Comments and
quantitative  evaluations  by  instructors  are  documented  in  every
phase  of  training  and  included  in  each  astronaut’s  personnel  file.
In addition to training in many areas ranging from spacecraft sys-
tems  to  robotics  and  space  walking  to  expedition  preparation,
NASA uses other processes to prepare and evaluate astronauts, in-
cluding  the  Instructor  Astronaut  Program,  the  Commander  Up-
grade  Program,  and  the  Astronaut  Evaluation  Board.  All  of  these
are used by the Chief of the Astronaut Office in the Flight Assign-
ment Recommendation Process.

Medical  standards  for  flight  are  used  by  the  Aerospace  Medicine
Board  to  make  certification  decisions.  Certification  results  are  ad-
dressed  during  bi-weekly  meetings  between  astronaut  and  flight
surgeon  management.  The  communication  and  relationship  be-
tween  flight  crew  operations  and  the  space  medicine  community  is
strong,  allowing  NASA  to  effectively  address  concerns  regarding
crew health and fitness. Flight surgeons are aware of their respon-
sibility  to  assure  that  an  astronaut’s  health  or  behavior  does  not
present  a  risk  to  themselves  or  the  mission,  and  the  flight  crew
management, as well as NASA’s leadership, support their efforts to
do so.

Flight crews are very fortunate to have a group of flight surgeons
who  are  not  only  excellent  physicians  but  who  understand  the
training  and  the  operational  environment  of  an  astronaut  and  the
implications  of  that  astronaut,  of  that  environment  to  astronaut
health. The flight surgeons are dedicated to maintaining or return-
ing astronauts to flight status when at all possible, keeping within
the medical standards that protect health and mission success.

Following the events of last February, Johnson Space Center con-
ducted  an  internal  assessment,  and  NASA  headquarters  charted
the  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee.  While  be-
havioral health recommendations were the focus of the health care
committee  report,  the  report  also  included  a  number  of  comments
related  to  Astronaut  Office  behavior  and  processes.  As  the  com-
mittee  itself  noted,  they  did  not  attempt  to  determine  the  veracity
of  those  comments,  nor  was  there  any  request  for  information  on
Astronaut Office processes, policies, or anything that could be char-
acterized as Astronaut Office culture.

In  response  to  the  committee  report  NASA  has  taken  decisive
steps.  Bryan  O’Connor’s  thorough  investigation  confirmed  my  own
personal  experiences  both  as  a  crew  member  and  a  manager  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

flight crew. We have found no instance where astronauts have used
alcohol  in  immediate  pre-flight  period  or  were  under  the  effects  or
influence  of  alcohol  at  launch.  And  no  case  where  a  flight  surgeon
or astronaut raised a concern about this to management.

NASA  has  also  responded  to  the  committee’s  report  by  devel-
oping an anonymous survey to determine what issues actually exist
and  their  scope.  This  survey  will  be  provided  to  the  Astronaut
Corps  and  flight  surgeons  this  month.  Both  groups  will  be  asked
to  respond  to  questions  regarding  communication,  trust,  and  re-
sponsibilities  and  regarding  potential  concerns  or  barriers  to  rais-
ing issues with flight safety or crew suitability for flight.

Additionally,  astronauts  will  be  asked  about  policies  and  proce-
dures  dealing  with  astronaut  performance  and  feedback,  crew  as-
signment,  and  space  flight  alcohol  use.  NASA  will  then  develop  a
plan to address any issues identified by the survey report, a course
of action that the committee indicated they intended as NASA’s re-
sponse.

In  conclusion,  I  am  extremely  proud  to  represent  the  Astronaut
Office,  both  within  NASA  and  externally  to  Members  of  this  com-
mittee,  to  the  media,  and  to  the  public.  Our  astronauts  are  well
prepared  to  carry  out  the  Nation’s  Human  Space  Flight  Program.
They take their responsibility very seriously.

The same can be said of the entire NASA team that prepares and
executes  human  space  flight  missions.  The  real  proof  of  that  lies
in  the  tremendous  accomplishments  of  our  Human  Space  Flight
Programs,  accomplishments  made  possible  by  the  dedicated  people
at  NASA;  our  engineers,  flight  controllers,  scientists,  doctors,  and
astronauts.

I would be happy to respond to any questions.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Ochoa follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELLEN OCHOA

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review
Committee  report.  I  have  the  privilege  of  managing  the  organization  that  includes
the  Astronaut  Office  and  the  Aircraft  Operations  Division  at  the  NASA  Johnson
Space  Center  in  Houston,  Texas.  Prior  to  becoming  Director  of  Flight  Crew  Oper-
ations  one  year  ago,  and  serving  as  Deputy  Director  for  four  years  before  that,  I
was a member of the astronaut office for 12 years, and was fortunate enough to fly
on four Space Shuttle missions.

The  NASA  Astronaut  Office  is  made  up  of  very  talented  and  motivated  people,
who—after  years  of  hard  work,  exceptional  achievement  in  science  and  engineering
education,  and  dedication  to  excellence  in  their  careers—joined  the  corps  through
a  rigorous  and  highly  competitive  selection  process.  Selection  as  an  astronaut  can-
didate is followed by years of intense preparation, including many types of training
as  well  as  work  in  support  of  all  phases  of  the  development  and  operations  of
NASA’s  human  space  flight  programs.  In  my  experience,  astronauts  prepare  thor-
oughly  and  uncompromisingly  for  their  missions.  One  of  my  crew  mates  compared
it  to  preparing  for  the  Olympics:  every  act  that  you  do  every  day  is  designed  to
make sure that you are at your peak both mentally and physically when you launch
into space. But at NASA, we hold our equivalent of the Olympics every few months,
every time we launch a crew into space.

About  10  years  ago,  as  we  began  assembly  of  the  International  Space  Station
(ISS), it became clear that astronaut preparation needed to be raised to a new level
in order to accommodate the increased complexity and difficulty of our new mission:
establishing  and  maintaining  a  permanent  human  presence  in  space.  Both  Shuttle
missions  to  the  Station,  which  can  be  thought  of  as  ‘‘sprints,’’  and  the  ‘‘marathon’’
long-duration  stays  on-board  ISS,  brought  new  challenges.  Along  with  the  Mission
Operations  Directorate—whose  job  is  to  ‘‘plan,  train,  and  fly’’  missions—and  the
Space  Life  Sciences  Directorate—who  ensures  the  crew’s  health  before,  during,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

35

after  flight—the  Flight  Crew  Operations  Directorate  developed  new  procedures,
processes, training, evaluation methods, and fitness standards to meet the challenge
of  successfully  assembling  and  operating  the  ISS.  These  processes  and  tools  have
evolved  over  the  past  decade,  and  have  served  us  well  in  preparing  the  corps  for
the rigors of space operations.
Astronaut Training and Evaluation

Standards  for  fitness  for  duty  and  for  flight  assignment  are  determined,  meas-
ured,  and  documented  using  a  number  of  processes  and  tools.  Formal  training,
which is subject to both qualitative and quantitative evaluation, is accomplished by
each  astronaut  in  many  different  fields.  Most  of  the  training  is  conducted  by  the
Space  Flight  Training  Division  within  the  Mission  Operations  Directorate  at  the
Johnson  Space  Center.  Comments  and  evaluations  by  instructors  about  each  astro-
naut  are  documented  in  every  phase  of  training  and  included  in  each  astronaut’s
personnel file. These training records are accessible by the individual astronaut, and
reviewed by the astronaut’s branch chief, and the Chief of the Astronaut Office.

The main areas of training include the following:

Space  Shuttle  Systems  and  Operations,  International  Space  Station
System  and  Operations  (including  all  International  Partners’  systems),  and
Crew  Resource  Management  training  ranges  from  tests  of  basic  systems
knowledge, to life-like simulations that test a crew’s ability to work together to
solve challenging failure scenarios.
Robotics  (including  the  Shuttle  6-joint  arm,  the  ISS  7-joint  arm  and  new
robotic  arms  from  Japan  and  Europe),  Spacewalking  (which  we  refer  to  as
Extra-vehicular  Activity  or  EVA),  and  Rendezvous  training  follow  formal  cur-
ricula  objectives;  quantitative  evaluations  of  astronauts  during  qualification
simulations are documented in a database as part of the training records.
Aircraft  training,  including  periodic  check  flights,  prepares  all  astronauts  for
the high-stress, multi-task space environment, and Shuttle commanders and pi-
lots receive detailed feedback on the hundreds of simulated Shuttle landing ap-
proaches that they fly.
Expedition Interpersonal Training is a program conducted by the Astronaut
Office  to  provide  an  in-depth  awareness  of  issues  that  may  develop  in  an  iso-
lated  and  confined  environment,  such  as  during  an  extended  stay  on  the  ISS.
Training  includes  workshops,  outdoor  team  building  and  supervised  leadership
courses,  and  missions  in  extreme  environments  such  as  an  undersea  facility
that  place  astronauts  in  the  most  realistic  space  analog  environment  available.
These  operational  opportunities  are  integrated  into  the  astronaut  training  pro-
gram  and  used  to  provide  feedback  both  to  the  astronauts  and  to  astronaut
management.
NASA also conducts various other types of training, such as Russian language
training.  Like  the  operational  training  discussed  above,  astronauts  are  rated
and  their  evaluations  are  provided  to  each  crew  member  and  the  Chief  of  the
Astronaut Office on a periodic basis.

Other  processes  that  NASA  uses  to  prepare  and  evaluate  astronauts  include  the

following:

The Space Shuttle Instructor Astronaut Program provides standardization
and  evaluation  of  astronaut  candidate  training,  continuing  currency  training
(with a special emphasis on robotics and EVA), and assigned crew training. This
program  also  reinforces  an  environment  in  which  mentoring  and  knowledge
sharing thrive.
The  Commander  Upgrade  Program  prepares  mission  commanders  to  man-
age  crew  and  mission  issues  pre-flight,  during  flight,  and  post-flight.  This  pro-
gram  has  been  implemented  for  all  Shuttle  commanders  since  2000;  NASA
plans  to  implement  a  formal  program  for  ISS  commanders  to  support  the  six-
person crews that will start in 2009.
The  Astronaut  Evaluation  Board  is  periodically  convened  by  the  Astronaut
Office  to  review  astronauts  completing  flight  assignments,  astronaut  candidate
training, or other astronauts recommended for review. The purpose of the Astro-
naut  Evaluation  Board  is  to  determine  the  flight  status  of  each  astronaut,  to
decide  upon  corrective  actions  if  necessary,  and  to  pass  recommendations  of
flight  status  and  corrective  actions  to  the  Chief,  Astronaut  Office  for  final  dis-
position. Astronauts who have been reviewed by the board are debriefed by the

Chief of the Astronaut Office, and the results are documented in their personnel
file.
Mission  performance  feedback  is  provided  by  Commanders  to  each  crew
member after completion of a space mission. This personnel information on each
crew member’s performance includes strengths and any areas for improvement.
Suggested areas of feedback include interpersonal interactions, knowledge base,
attitude  and  work  ethic,  skills,  and  ability  to  balance  technical  assignments
with training.

Flight Assignments

All  of  the  policies,  processes,  and  feedback  described  above  are  used  by  the  Chief
of  the  Astronaut  Office  in  the  flight  assignment  recommendation  process.  A  par-
ticular crew assignment is based foremost on the specific mission requirements, and
crew  members  are  recommended  based  on  their  performance  during  training,  sys-
tems knowledge and their ability to apply it in an operational environment, previous
flight  performance,  effectiveness  in  technical  job  assignments,  and  assessments  of
leadership capability, teamwork, and judgment.

Other factors considered in flight assignment include international partner agree-
ments,  skill  mix,  appropriate  mix  of  veteran  and  rookie  crew  members,  anthropo-
metric constraints due to EVA suit and vehicle sizing, and medical eligibility.
Medical Fitness for Flight and Duty

As  noted  in  Dr.  Williams’  testimony,  medical  standards  for  fitness  for  flight  and
fitness  for  duty  are  developed  by  the  Space  Medicine  Division  of  the  Space  Life
Sciences Directorate at the NASA Johnson Space Center, in concert with experts in
various  medical  fields  internal  and  external  to  NASA.  The  standards  are  reviewed
and  approved  at  several  levels,  and  are  used  by  the  Flight  Medicine  Clinic  and
Aerospace  Medicine  Board  to  make  certification  decisions.  Certification  results  are
reported to the Astronaut Office in weekly and monthly reports.

Astronaut  medical  issues  affecting  flight  status  for  aircraft,  and  short  and  long
duration  space  flight  are  also  addressed  during  biweekly  meetings  between  the
Chief  of  the  Astronaut  Office  and  the  Chief  of  the  Space  Medicine  Division.  Any
medical  issues  that  affect  a  member  of  an  assigned  crew  are  also  coordinated  with
me and the Director of Space Life Sciences.

The  communication  and  relationship  between  Flight  Crew  Operations  and  the
Space Medicine community is strong and effective, allowing NASA to effectively ad-
dress concerns regarding safety and crew health. Flight surgeons are aware of their
responsibility  to  assure  that  an  astronaut’s  health  or  behavior  does  not  present  a
risk to themselves or the mission, and the Flight Crew Operations management, as
well  as  NASA’s  leadership,  support  their  efforts  to  do  so.  Medical  issues  that  arise
immediately pre-flight or in-flight are discussed among operational, medical, and as-
tronaut  management  on  a  need-to-know  basis,  giving  due  consideration  to  privacy,
crew member health and safety, and mission impact. NASA currently employs a sys-
tem for reporting any situation requiring attention that may impact safety of flight
that  utilizes  multiple  and  independent  technical  authority  pathways  outside  of  the
flight  program  management  to  elevate  and  resolve  concerns.  Similar  to  the  inde-
pendent  technical  authority  chain  of  command  that  deals  with  any  technical  issues
related  to  flight  safety,  the  agency  governance  structure  provides  a  path  for  dis-
senting  opinions  to  be  raised  through  the  Health  and  Medical  Technical  Authority
chain of command. Additional program independent pathways for elevating concerns
include the Johnson Space Center Safety and Mission Assurance Director or Center
Director,  the  Center  Ombuds,  or  to  NASA  Headquarters  via  the  Chief  Safety  and
Mission Assurance Officer, Bryan O’Connor. This governance structure is often reit-
erated  to  our  employees  and  we  have  again  re-emphasized  these  pathways  to  our
astronauts and flight surgeons.

The  flight  crews  are  very  fortunate  to  have  a  group  of  flight  surgeons  who  are
not only excellent physicians, but who understand the training and operational envi-
ronment  of  an  astronaut  and  the  implications  of  that  environment  to  astronaut
health.  The  flight  surgeons  are  tireless  in  their  efforts  to  obtain  the  best  possible
care  for  an  astronaut,  during  training  anywhere  in  the  world  as  well  as  in  space,
and  they  work  long  hours  to  ensure  that  any  issue  is  thoroughly  addressed.  They
are  dedicated  to  maintaining  or  returning  astronauts  to  flight  status  when  at  all
possible,  keeping  within  the  medical  standards  that  protect  astronaut  health  and
mission success.
NASA’s  Response  to  the  Astronaut  Health  Care  Review  Committee  Report
Following  the  events  of  last  February,  Johnson  Space  Center  conducted  an  inter-
nal  assessment  to  review  and  recommend  changes  to  astronaut  behavioral  health

screening and assessment, and NASA Headquarters chartered an Astronaut Health
Care Review Committee in order to more broadly review astronaut medical care, in-
cluding  behavioral  health.  There  were  some  recommendations  common  to  both  re-
views, including adding a behavioral health assessment as part of the annual astro-
naut  physical  examination.  In  addition,  the  Health  Care  Review  Committee  made
a number of suggestions concerning behavioral health care, which are being followed
up on by the Space Medicine Division.

While those recommendations were the focus of the review and the report, the re-
port  also  included  a  number  of  comments  related  to  astronaut  office  behavior  and
processes,  based  on  meetings  between  some  Committee  members  and  some  astro-
nauts,  astronaut  dependents,  and  flight  surgeons.  The  Committee  did  not  attempt
to  determine  the  veracity  of  any  statement,  nor  was  there  any  request  for  informa-
tion  on  astronaut  office  processes,  procedures,  policy,  or  anything  that  could  be
broadly characterized as astronaut office culture.

In  response  to  the  Committee  report,  NASA  has  taken  decisive  steps.  As  Bryan
O’Connor  has  already  testified,  his  thorough  investigation  confirmed  my  own  per-
sonal  experience  as  both  a  crew  member  and  a  manager  of  flight  crew:  we  have
found  no  instance  where  astronauts  have  used  alcohol  in  the  immediate  pre-flight
period,  no  instances  of  astronauts  being  under  the  effects  or  influence  of  alcohol  at
launch, and no case where a flight surgeon or astronaut has raised a concern about
this to management, and, therefore, in no case was that concern ignored. To ensure
that  there  is  no  future  question  regarding  use  of  alcohol,  I  have  taken  the  oppor-
tunity  to  clarify  our  space  flight  alcohol  policy,  and,  based  on  Bryan  O’Connor’s  re-
view,  will  determine  whether  any  revision  or  expansion  of  the  policy  is  warranted.
NASA  has  also  responded  to  the  Committee’s  report  by  developing  a  systematic,
comprehensive,  and  anonymous  survey  to  determine  what,  if  any,  issues  actually
exist,  which  will  be  provided  to  the  Astronaut  Corps  and  flight  surgeons  later  this
month.  Both  astronauts  and  flight  surgeons  will  be  asked  to  respond  to  questions
probing  the  relationship  between  the  two  groups  and  their  respective  managers  as
determined  by  level  and  quality  of  communication,  trust,  and  clarity  of  responsibil-
ities  and  authorities.  Another  objective  is  to  understand  any  potential  concerns  in
raising or responding to issues with flight safety or crew suitability for flight or any
barriers that might exist to raising concerns. Additionally, astronauts will be asked
about their understanding of and suggested changes or clarifications to policies and
procedures dealing with astronaut performance and feedback, crew assignment, and
space  flight  alcohol  use.  After  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  survey  responses  has
been  conducted,  the  Chief  of  the  Astronaut  Office  will  hold  astronaut  all-hands
meetings to clarify and validate the analysis in preparation for a final report. NASA
will  then  develop  a  plan  to  address  any  issues  identified  through  the  survey.  This
is a course of action that the committee itself has indicated they intended as NASA’s
response to their report.

I  am  committed  to  understanding  and  addressing  any  issues  that  are  identified
by  the  survey,  as  are  the  Chief  of  the  Astronaut  Office,  Steve  Lindsey,  the  Chief
of  the  Space  Medicine  Division,  Dr.  Mike  Duncan,  and  the  Director  of  Space  Life
Sciences,  Dr.  Jeff  Davis.  We  are  fully  accountable  to  the  Director  of  Johnson  Space
Center, Mike Coats, who in turn is accountable to the NASA Administrator. We will
accomplish this while appropriately balancing these efforts with our primary duties
of ensuring mission success and safety of round-the-clock flight operations on-board
the  ISS  Program,  and  the  planning  and  execution  of  the  challenging  Space  Shuttle
missions to complete the assembly of ISS.
Conclusion

I  am  extremely  proud  to  represent  the  Astronaut  Office,  both  within  NASA  at
many  different  agency  and  program  forums  including  flight  readiness  reviews  and
mission  management  team  meetings,  as  well  as  externally—to  the  Members  of  this
committee,  to  the  media,  and  to  the  public.  I  admire  and  respect  what  America’s
astronauts  accomplish  day  in  and  day  out,  while  in  space,  in  the  air,  and  on  the
ground.  Their  hard  work,  dedication,  and  continual  commitment  to  excellence  and
flight safety are the hallmarks of their profession.

I  am  confident  that  our  astronauts  are  well-prepared  to  carry  out  the  Nation’s
human  space  flight  program  and  our  next  great  era  of  Exploration;  they  take  their
responsibility  very  seriously.  The  same  can  be  said  of  the  entire  NASA  team  that
prepares  and  executes  human  space  flight  missions.  The  real  proof  of  that  lies  in
the tremendous accomplishments of our human space flight programs.

We just successfully completed STS–118, our 119th Shuttle mission, and the 22nd
Shuttle  mission  to  the  ISS.  Through  92  EVAs  totaling  548  hours,  we  have  learned
to  successfully  construct  complex  structures,  and  repair  and  maintain  them,  even
when  the  individual  parts  have  been  built  and  tested  in  several  different  countries

with  no  opportunity  to  do  end-to-end  tests  prior  to  launch.  A  total  of  13  countries
have  sent  140  people  to  the  ISS.  With  the  European  and  Japanese  laboratories
scheduled to launch in the near future, international cooperation will extend beyond
the operational communities to the science communities. We are able to accomplish
these  extraordinary  feats  because  of  the  extraordinary  people  at  NASA,  our  engi-
neers, flight controllers, scientists, doctors, and our astronauts.
I would be happy to respond to any questions that you have.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Ochoa.
Mr. O’Connor.

STATEMENT OF MR. BRYAN D. O’CONNOR, CHIEF, SAFETY AND
MISSION  ASSURANCE,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE
ADMINISTRATION
Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee
and  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  address  you
on the subject of space flight crew safety.

As  NASA’s  Chief  of  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance,  I  report  di-
rectly  to  our  Administrator  on  matters  dealing  with  ground  safety
and  flight  safety,  and  I  also  have  policy  and  functional  oversight
responsibility for this agency, for the safety organizations assigned
to  each  of  the  centers  across  the  agency.  My  organizational  rela-
tionships  with  flight  crew  operations  and  with  the  Chief  Health
and Medical Officer are included in my written remarks.

In its final report dated 27-July-2007, the Astronaut Health Care
System  Review  Committee  found  the  following:  ‘‘Interviews  with
flight  surgeons  and  astronauts  identified  episodes  of  heavy  use  of
alcohol  by  astronauts  in  the  immediate  pre-flight  period  which  led
to  flight  safety  concerns.  Two  specific  instances  were  described
where astronauts had been so intoxicated prior to flight that flight
surgeons and or fellow astronauts raised concerns to local, on-scene
leadership  regarding  flight  safety.  However,  the  individuals  were
still permitted to fly.’’

In  response,  the  Deputy  Administrator  appointed  me  to  review
the  reported  allegations.  The  purpose  of  my  review  is  two-fold.
Number  one,  evaluate  the  committee’s  finding  related  to  the  inap-
propriate use of or abuse of alcohol by astronauts in the immediate
pre-flight  space  flight  period.  And  two,  evaluate  relevant  existing
policies covering alcohol use and abuse at NASA.

My approach to the review was to learn as much as I could about
the reported allegations through interviews, data searches, and his-
tory  review.  The  goal  here  was  to  establish  the  nature  and  the
scope  of  any  flight  crew  alcohol  abuse,  thus  enabling  a  more  in-
formed  course  of  action  in  our  policies,  procedures,  risk  mitigation
strategies, our authority structure, and communication systems.

The scope of my review was limited to space flight, with focus on
the  activities  on  launch  day  from  crew  wake  up  until  launch.  For
this potential flight safety issue, the relevant question was, did we
have an instance where a crew member presented on launch morn-
ing in an impaired state, was it observed as such by the flight sur-
geon  or  another  crew  member,  and  then  over  their  objections  was
cleared to fly that day by operational management?

Consistent with our standard approach to anonymous safety con-
cerns,  my  investigative  method  included  a  search  of  over  1,500
anonymous reporting system and confidential hotline reports going
back to 1987, when we first established the NASA Safety Reporting

System. And with the help of the NASA Safety Center we searched
literally  tens  of  thousands  of  mishap  and  close  call  records  going
back  that  same  length  of  time.  I  received  inputs  by  phone,  e-mail,
in  person,  from  over  130  individuals  who  have  been  involved  one
way or another in activities during the last few days before launch,
either  at  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  or  at  the  Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. I heard from every one of our current
operational flight surgeons and nearly 80 percent of the current As-
tronaut Corps and many former astronauts.

I  also  talked  to  suit  technicians,  medical  staff,  operational  man-
agers,  crew  quarters  managers,  food  preparation  and  service  staff,
and  closeout  crew  technicians.  The  closeout  crew  are  the  last  peo-
ple to see the crew before launch.

To supplement this review I reminded members of the flight com-
munity  at  all  times  that  they  should  use  the  hotlines  and  the
NASA  Safety  Reporting  System  for  any  flight  safety  information
they  felt  reluctant  to  provide  to  me  in  an  open  forum,  and  I  re-
viewed those hotlines and NSRS System throughout.

Also,  NASA’s  preparing  a  focused  anonymous  survey  as  a  follow
up  to  this.  This  survey  will  try  to  flush  out  any  residual  concerns
in this or other areas covered by the committee report.

Within the scope and the limitations of my review, I was not able
to verify any case in which an astronaut space flight crew member
was  impaired  on  launch  day  or  any  case  where  a  NASA  manager
disregarded  recommendations  by  a  flight  surgeon  or  another  crew
member  that  an  astronaut  crew  member  not  be  allowed  to  fly  on
the  Shuttle  or  the  Soyuz.  Should  such  a  situation  present  itself  in
the  future,  I  am  confident  from  my  review  that  there  are  reason-
able  safeguards  in  place,  including  such  things  as  the  flight  sur-
geon check that morning, the presence of flight crew managers, TV
cameras,  suit  technicians,  and  other  technical  and  administrative
staff and supervisors that would keep us from ever allowing an im-
paired crew member from boarding a spacecraft.

As  for  the  chance  that  we  will  disregard  a  flight  surgeon  or  a
crew member’s safety concerns, I found that although there may be
occasional  disagreements  among  operations  and  medical  team
members, all parties understood their roles and authorities and the
multiple  safety  reporting  and  appeal  paths  we  have  put  in  place,
some as late as the last two years.

My  report  makes  one  recommendation  to  improve  flight  surgeon
oversight  during  launch  day  activities  and  several  recommenda-
tions  concerning  relevant  agency  policies  that  should  be  improved
for scope and clarity. This review is complete, but I have reminded
our  workforce  that  any  alcohol  abuse  or  other  flight  safety  threats
should  be  reported  in  an  open  forum  or  if  necessary,  through  any
one  of  the  several  anonymous  reporting  systems  we  have  in  place
at NASA.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRYAN D. O’CONNOR

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity

to address the Subcommittee on the subject of flight crew safety.

My  name  is  Bryan  O’Connor,  NASA’s  Chief,  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance.  I  re-
port  directly  to  Dr.  Griffin  on  matters  dealing  with  ground  and  flight  safety,  and

I have policy and functional oversight responsibility for the safety organizations as-
signed to each of the Centers across the Agency, as well as to all Agency programs.
My counterpart for health and medical matters is Dr. Rich Williams, NASA’s Chief
Health  and  Medical  Officer,  as  well  as  the  Agency’s  Designated  Safety  and  Health
Official. He has policy and functional oversight over of all health and medical activi-
ties  at  NASA.  We  both  have  oversight  of  astronaut-related  activities;  my  emphasis
is on safety and his is on health. I have a close relationship with the Johnson Space
Center Director, Mike Coats, who is responsible for the health and safety of the as-
tronauts.  We  and  our  delegates  all  share  seats  at  readiness  reviews  and  manage-
ment  councils  as  the  agendas  dictate.  I  have  no  direct  oversight  over  health  or  be-
havioral  issues  except  as  they  become  or  threaten  to  become  safety  issues.  We  en-
sure that appropriate safety and medical experts are members of human experimen-
tation safety reviews, and we require medical or human factors professionals on all
of  our  mishap  investigation  boards.  Finally,  following  a  recommendation  from  the
Challenger  accident,  there  is  a  standing  flight  safety  panel  chaired  by  an  experi-
enced  astronaut  who  supports  my  human  space  flight  activities,  including  selected
assessments and readiness reviews.

There  are  several  high  level  directives  outlining  NASA’s  health  and  safety  pro-
grams,  the  highest  being  NPD  8710.2,  NASA  Safety  and  Health  Program.  Below
that policy directive are other policy documents that outline responsibilities and con-
tain requirements and standards for our programs. Examples are directives on occu-
pational  health  and  safety,  emergency  preparedness,  and  mishap  reporting.  Under
our program management policies is the NASA Human Rating Requirements direc-
tive.  All  of  these  directives  outline  responsibilities  for  people  in  operations,  medical
and  safety  organizations.  My  organization  has  the  authority  to  assure  compliance
with  these  policies  and  requirements.  When  we  conduct  audits,  we  always  include
appropriate  operational  and  medical  professionals  to  evaluate  compliance  with  re-
quirements in their areas of expertise.
The Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee Report

In its final report, dated 27 July, 2007, the Astronaut Health Care System Review
Committee  found  the  following:  ‘‘Interviews  with  flight  surgeons  and  astronauts
identified episodes of heavy use of alcohol by astronauts in the immediate pre-flight
period,  which  has  led  to  flight  safety  concerns.’’  Specifically,  the  report  noted  that
‘‘Two  specific  instances  were  described  where  astronauts  had  been  so  intoxicated
prior  to  flight  that  flight  surgeons  and  or  fellow  astronauts  raised  concerns  to  local
on-scene leadership regarding flight safety. However, the individuals were still per-
mitted to fly.’’ The report findings, if true, describe a serious close call. NASA takes
this  matter  very  seriously  as  it  represents  a  threat  to  our  mission,  and  is  a  clear
affront to NASA’s core values of safety, integrity, teamwork and mission success. To
address  this  potentially  serious  safety  risk,  NASA  decided  that  a  review  of  the
events and circumstances was required. The Deputy Administrator chartered me to
conduct  a  review  that  would  evaluate  the  Committee’s  finding  related  to  the  inap-
propriate  use  or  abuse  of  alcohol  by  astronauts  in  the  immediate  pre-flight  period.
My  charter  further  calls  for  a  review  of  existing  policies  and  procedures  related  to
alcohol  use  and  space  flight  crew  medical  fitness  during  the  immediate  pre-flight
preparation.

The  Committee  report  offered  three  recommendations  related  to  their  alcohol
abuse  finding  which  cover  policies  dealing  with  alcohol  use  and  abuse  as  well  as
communication  management  of  safety  concerns  by  crew  members  and  flight  sur-
geons.  My  approach  to  the  review  was  to  learn  as  much  as  I  could  about  the  re-
ported  allegations  in  order  to  establish  the  nature  and  scope  of  any  flight-day  im-
pairment  and  subsequent  override  of  legitimate  flight  surgeon  or  crew  objections.
This would enable a more informed course of action in our policies, procedures, risk
mitigation  strategies  and  communications  systems.  This  review  would  be  supple-
mented  by  ongoing  safety  and  health  actions  responsive  to  other  parts  of  the  Com-
mittee  report,  an  anonymous  survey  being  prepared  for  distribution  in  September,
as  well  as  the  several  open  and  anonymous  safety  reporting  systems  already  in
place.
Scope and Method

Consistent  with  the  serious  implications  of  the  Committee’s  report,  my  focus  was
on  alcohol  use  or  abuse  that  would  have  resulted  in  impairment  on  the  day  of
launch. Equally important in my review was the reported disregard by management
for the flight surgeon’s or crew’s recommendation against flight. I did not review al-
cohol  use  in  general  or  as  an  aircraft  safety  issue,  although  I  did  review  relevant
policies  to  ensure  that  they  are  or  will  be  consistent  for  space  flight,  aircraft  flying
and  other  mission  critical  activities.  My  question  was,  ‘‘did  we  actually  have  a  case

where we strapped, or almost strapped, an impaired astronaut into a spacecraft over
the  objections  of  his  or  her  flight  surgeon,  and  if  so,  how  did  we  get  to  that  point,
and  what  policies,  procedures,  risk  mitigators  do  we  need  to  change  to  avoid  such
an event in the future?’’

The Committee Chairman provided a few important details about these incidents
in  his  press  conference,  and  a  subsequent  discussion  with  me,  but  he  was  unable
to give us more information, references, timelines or sources for the reported allega-
tions due to promised anonymity for witnesses. Therefore, I resorted to investigation
techniques  consistent  with  our  other  anonymous  reporting  systems.  I  reviewed  rel-
evant  policies,  procedures  and  near-launch  timelines  and  staffing.  I  inspected  the
crew  quarters  facilities  at  both  Johnson  and  Kennedy  Space  Centers,  and  inter-
viewed  managers  familiar  with  the  Cosmonaut  crew  quarters  in  Kazakhstan.  I  re-
viewed results from the Johnson Space Center and Space Shuttle Program hotlines,
the  NASA  Safety  Reporting  System  (NSRS),  and  NASA’s  close  call  and  mishap  re-
porting systems for evidence related to astronaut alcohol abuse and space or aircraft
flight. My data search went back 20 years, a time-span where U.S. astronauts flew
94 Shuttle missions and 10 Soyuz missions.

I also reached out to people who spent time as crew members or in support roles
in  the  crew  quarters  at  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  and  the  Baikonur  Cosmodrome
in  Kazakhstan.  This  included  current  and  former  astronauts,  flight  surgeons,  re-
search  and  operations  support  nurses,  Shuttle  suit  technicians,  close-out-crew  tech-
nicians, and the managers and staff of the crew (quarantine) quarters. I asked them
to volunteer any information they could give me about this matter. Consistent with
safety  investigation  techniques,  I  avoided  leading  questions,  and  medical  privacy
matters  not  directly  related  to  flight  safety,  allowing  the  individuals  to  give  me
whatever  information  they  considered  relevant.  I  heard  from  more  than  90  individ-
uals representing all of the groups mentioned. Although I received a good response,
there are, understandably, still some who might be reluctant to come forward with-
out  a  guarantee  of  anonymity.  Therefore,  I  made  it  clear  to  all  possible  witnesses
that they could use the confidential hotline or the anonymous NASA Safety Report-
ing  System  to  tell  me  their  story.  In  summary,  this  was  a  safety  review,  not  a  dis-
ciplinary  investigation.  The  NASA  Inspector  General  has  announced  his  intent  to
review  the  results  of  this  review,  and  if  necessary  to  follow  as  appropriate  to  his
authority and oversight responsibilities.
Results

The results of my inquiry and data search to date are as follows:

1. Alcohol,  mostly  wine  and  beer,  is  available  in  the  crew  quarters  quarantine
facilities  for  use  by  astronauts  during  off-duty  hours.  This  practice  exists
under  a  combination  of  societal  norms  and  local  standard  operating  proce-
dures.

2. Of  the  thousands  of  government  mishaps  and  close  calls  recorded  since  the
inception  of  our  electronic  mishap  databases  in  the  late  80s  and  early  90s,
none involved alcohol or drug use or abuse by an astronaut.

3. Of  the  680  anonymous  safety  concerns  reported  to  and  investigated  by  the
NASA Safety Reporting System since its inception in 1987, none involved as-
tronaut alcohol or drug use or abuse.

4. Of the 863 Safety Hotline reports recorded since its inception in 1991 to the

present, none involves alcohol or drug use or abuse by an astronaut.

5. Although  Johnson  Space  Center  does  not  reveal  the  identities  of  personnel
involved in disciplinary actions, the most recent report to OSHA covering the
years 2002 through 2006 includes a total of seven such actions related to al-
cohol  or  drugs  at  the  center.  Informal  input  from  Flight  Crew  Operations
was that none of these involved astronauts.

6. Of  the  more  than  90  individuals  who  answered  my  call  for  information,  not
one  offered  any  evidence  of  alcohol  use  or  abuse  in  the  immediate  pre-flight
timeframe: Shuttle, Soyuz, or T–38, and none revealed any cases where man-
agement disregarded flight surgeon or crew concerns about crew alcohol and
space flight.

7. Regarding  relevant  policy,  there  are  some  gaps  in  scope,  and  some  areas  in

need of clarification.

My review revealed that, although alcohol is available to crew members, it is not
known  to  be  used  during  work  hours  or  beyond  the  start  of  the  mandatory  sleep
period, which begins at about 18 hours prior to launch for rendezvous missions (i.e.,
Space Station), and 12 hours before launch for other missions. Most people involved
in the day of launch activities in crew quarters found it hard to imagine that a crew

42

member  would  put  his/her  mission  and  fellow  crew  members  at  risk  by  reporting
on  the  day  of  launch  impaired  for  space  flight.  Crew  members  reminded  me  that
each  one  of  them  must  be  fit  enough  for  an  unaided  emergency  pad  egress  should
there  be  a  fire  or  other  major  emergency  before  liftoff.  They  practice  this  drill  in
the  simulator  and  in  the  actual  vehicle  in  the  Terminal  Countdown  Demonstration
Test  normally  held  a  couple  of  weeks  before  scheduled  launch.  Even  a  few  seconds
delay in unstrapping and egressing from the Shuttle could cost lives, and executing
this demanding task while wearing heavy flight equipment takes the speed, coordi-
nation,  judgment,  and  situational  awareness  that  only  exist  in  a  sober  crew  mem-
ber.

Then there is the lack of privacy. From the time the crew wakes on launch morn-
ing  until  they  lift  off,  they  are  surrounded  by  crew  members,  managers,  support
crew,  television  crews,  still  photographers,  crew  quarters  staff,  etc.  Breakfast,  the
first  scheduled  event,  normally  half  a  hour  after  wakeup,  is  in  a  room  shared  by
their managers and other crew members. Shortly after breakfast, each crew member
receives a short final visit from the flight surgeon. Although this last medical check-
up  is  limited,  the  doctors  tell  me  that  it  is  adequate  to  reveal  signs  of  alcohol  im-
pairment. Lunch is in front of live television cameras and, after lunch, the live tele-
vision cameras are there for close-ups as the suit technicians, one per crew member,
work  closely  with  them  through  donning  and  system  integrity  checks.  The  doctors
observe this activity as well. Walkout to the Astrovan is on live television and, when
they  reach  the  launch  pad,  the  Close  Out  Crew  helps  the  crew  members  don  their
parachute harnesses and strap them into their seats. These highly supervised, very
public activities offer many opportunities to spot an impaired crew member, whether
from  alcohol  or  some  other  sudden  medical  problem,  before  their  impairment  could
affect the mission. Finally, the crew commanders know that they are responsible for
the  performance  of  their  crew  in  the  training  and  flight  environment.  They  know
that  thousands  of  people  and  millions  of  dollars  are  involved  in  getting  a  Space
Shuttle  to  this  point  in  the  countdown,  and  they  know  the  challenges  and  risks  in-
herent  in  space  flight.  They  know  that  if  one  of  their  crew  members  reported  for
work on launch morning impaired by alcohol, and a crew commander failed to report
that and take other appropriate actions, that they would be held accountable nearly
as much as the offending crew member.

The  operation  in  Kazakhstan  is  similar  to  that  at  Kennedy  Space  Center,  with
some  small  differences.  The  crew  members  typically  go  to  the  Cosmonaut  Hotel  for
quarantine two to three weeks before launch. Again, alcohol is available for off-duty
hours,  and  there  is  a  special  ceremony  held  before  the  crew  goes  to  the  launch  pad
that involves a champagne toast. Those who have participated in this event told me
that  the  amount  of  alcohol  is  very  small,  and  most  of  the  time,  the  crew  members,
Russian and American, only touch the glass to their lips. NASA flight surgeons did
not express any concern to me about this ritual, even though it does violate the let-
ter of most aviation alcohol policies. Another important difference in the Soyuz oper-
ation is that either the Russian or the U.S. flight surgeon has the authority to pull
an impaired crew member from the flight up to and including launch morning. The
Soyuz crews have fully trained backups for just such emergencies. One area of con-
cern  was  that  there  is  not  always  a  room  for  the  NASA  flight  crew  management
representative,  who  must  then  live  across  the  street  with  the  crew  families  in  an-
other  building.  This  could  limit  crew  management  presence  in  off  hours.  My  report
recommends  that  NASA  work  with  the  Russian  Space  Agency  to  ensure  full  time
accommodation for crew operational manager(s) in the Cosmonaut Hotel, thus dupli-
cating the full time oversight situation at KSC.

As  for  T–38  and  other  aircraft  flight  activities,  astronaut  pilots  come  to  NASA
only  after  years  of  operational  and  flight  test  experience.  Any  pilot  with  a  prior
record  of  poor  judgment  would  not  be  competitive  in  the  selection  process.  So,  it  is
commonly  expected  that  those  selected  for  the  Astronaut  Corps  have  a  reasonable
level  of  maturity  as  well  as  flying  skill.  They  are  trusted  implicitly  to  fly  profes-
sionally, and the relatively low mishap rate of NASA T–38 operations speaks to that
(no class A mishaps in over 20 years and nearly 160,000 flying hours). Technically,
it  would  not  be  difficult  for  a  crew  member  to  drink  and  fly  impaired,  especially
when  he  or  she  is  flying  solo  cross  country.  NASA’s  T–38  policy  calls  for  12  hours
between the last drink and takeoff, and prohibits flying impaired. Also, most NASA
astronaut T–38 pilots are active duty military detailees, and thus subject to the Uni-
form  Code  of  Military  Justice.  They  know  that  flying  impaired,  or  acting  in  any
manner  unbecoming  an  officer  on  or  off  the  job  could  be  the  first  step  to  a  court-
martial.  Having  said  that,  some  whom  I  interviewed  admitted  that  it  is  possible
that someone could have inadvertently violated the 12 hour rule by a small amount
at  some  time  in  their  military  or  NASA  flying  career  (note:  the  FAA  imposes  an
eight-hour restriction on airline pilots). However, none of them admitted to ever vio-

lating or witnessing a violation of what is arguably the more important part of any
alcohol policy—that flying while impaired is prohibited.

As  I  looked  at  our  policies  regarding  alcohol  and  flight,  I  found  several  areas
where  they  conflict  with  one  another,  or  are  lacking  in  scope,  specificity  or  clarity.
For  example,  shortly  after  the  Committee  report  was  published,  we  realized  that
there is no specific ‘‘bottle to throttle’’ rule for space flight, as had been in place for
many  years  for  T–38  operations.  As  an  interim  step,  and  while  we  review  all  our
policies  and  procedures  in  this  area,  we  have  since  applied  the  T–38  rules  to  space
flight.
Summary

Although my review by nature was not, and probably could never be, exhaustive,
it  represents  a  great  deal  more  investigation  than  what  I  would  normally  do  in  re-
sponse  to  an  anonymous  safety  concern.  I  received  over  80  percent  participation  of
the  astronaut  and  100  percent  participation  of  the  flight  surgeon  communities.
These  are  high  percentages  of  survey  participation,  considering  the  substantial
numbers  who  were  engaged  in  the  recent  Shuttle  mission,  training  in  all  corners
of the globe, or on summer leave.

I  cannot  say  conclusively  that  none  of  the  incidents  reported  to  the  Committee
ever  happened.  However,  I  was  unable  to  verify  that  they  did.  I  am  confident  that
there  are  enough  safeguards  in  the  form  of  doctors,  managers,  and  witnesses  in
place  to  prevent  an  impaired  crew  member  from  being  strapped  into  a  spacecraft.
As for the relationships among flight crews, flight surgeons and operations and med-
ical managers, I found as good a situation as I personally have seen in many years.
The  flight  docs  point  with  pride  to  the  fact  that,  in  over  25  years  of  Space  Shuttle
operations, including 119 Shuttle flights, not one has had to be terminated early for
a  crew  medical  problem.  Although  there  may  be  occasional  disagreements,  I  found
that  all  parties  understand  their  roles  and  authorities  and  the  multiple  safety  re-
porting  and  appeal  paths.  Some  or  all  of  the  reported  incidents  could  possibly  have
happened  during  earlier  times  in  the  countdown  where  there  are  fewer  witnesses
and, if so, they would represent ground safety and flight schedule threats. Moreover,
disregarding duly assigned flight surgeons on crew health matters is a serious mat-
ter,  but  the  flight  surgeon  community  was  unanimous  in  their  assurance  that  they
have  never  been  overruled  or  disregarded  on  a  space  flight  safety  call  at  launch
time.  This  review  was  a  focused  look  at  the  most  serious  implications  of  the  Com-
mittee  report.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  our  anonymous  reporting  and  other  sys-
tems for indications of these kinds of problems. And, the safety community will con-
tinue  to  support  the  agency  as  it  moves  forward  on  the  Health  Committee’s  rec-
ommendations.

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  O’Connor.  Thank  you  to  the
panel. We should give everybody an update. We have a looming set
of votes, but we are going to start now with the first round of ques-
tions, and we will play it by ear because we do really want to hear
from  everybody  on  the  panel  and  give  everybody  a  chance  to  ask
their questions.

At this point the Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.

CONTRASTING VIEWS AND FINDINGS FROM THE ASTRONAUT

HEALTH CARE SYSTEM REVIEW COMMITTEE

Colonel  Bachmann,  I  would  like  to  focus  on  your  testimony,  and
I  speak  for  myself,  although  I  think  I  might  speak  for  other  Mem-
bers of the Subcommittee when I say it is hard for us to hear your
testimony followed by that of the NASA witnesses and not be some-
what  troubled.  On  the  one  hand  your  committee  found  that,
quoting  you,  ‘‘Several  senior  flight  surgeons  expressed  their  belief
that  their  medical  opinions  regarding  astronaut  fitness  for  duty,
flight  safety,  and  mission  accomplishments  were  not  valued  by

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

leadership  other  than  to  validate  that  all  medical  systems  were  go
for an on-time mission completion.’’

And  to  continue,  ‘‘Instances  were  described  where  major  crew
medical or behavioral problems were identified to astronaut leader-
ship, and the medical advice was disregarded.’’

And  finally,  your  testimony  and  your  committee  relayed  the  fol-
lowing.  ‘‘Crew  members  raised  concerns  regarding  substandard  as-
tronaut task performance which were similarly disregarded.’’ I then
contrast that with Mr. O’Connor’s space flight safety review report
in  which  he  includes  an  e-mail  letter  from  all  of  the  JSC  mission
operations flight surgeons in which they state, ‘‘In the course of as-
tronaut  mission,  operations,  and  training  our  safety  and  medical
concerns  have  not  been  ignored  by  NASA  medical  operations,  the
Astronaut  Office,  Mission  Operations  Directorate,  the  Aircraft  Op-
erations Directorate, NISS, and Shuttle Program Management.’’

And  then  with  Dr.  Ochoa’s  written  testimony  which  states  that,
‘‘The  communication  and  relationship  between  flight  crew  oper-
ations  and  the  space  medicine  community  is  strong  and  effective,
allowing NASA to effectively address concerns regarding safety and
crew health.’’

To pick up on what Chairman Gordon said in his remarks, it al-
most  seems  as  though  we  are  hearing  about  two  completely  dif-
ferent  organizations.  Why  did  your  committee  paint  such  a  dif-
ferent  picture  than  the  one  that  NASA  personnel  is  describing  to
the Subcommittee? And could you provide some specifics to help us
better understand the basis for your committee’s findings?

Colonel  BACHMANN.  Yes,  sir,  and  I  agree  that  the  pictures  that

are painted by the two reports are diametrically in opposition.

Any  answer  about  why  would  be  speculation  on  my  part.  What
the  committee  gathered  together  and  wrote  in  the  report  and
unanimously  supports  is  what  the  astronauts  and  flight  surgeons
told  us  either  face  to  face  or  over  the  phone  during  the  course  of
our committee investigation, evaluation.

The fact that they are not coming forward with similar concerns
when NASA asks the question, I believe still represents a problem.
The  why  I  think  is  an  area  of  communication  and  concern  about
what is going to happen to them and what is going to be done with
the information. That is why we really put a great deal of emphasis
on  the  anonymous  survey  so  that  people  feel  that  they  can  speak
freely.

Chairman  UDALL.  Returning  to  your  report,  Colonel,  ‘‘Many  of
the  cultural  and  structural  issues  identified  in  this  report,’’  I  am
again  quoting  from  what  your  committee  wrote,  as—let  me  start
over.  ‘‘Many  of  the  cultural  and  structural  issues  identified  in  this
report  as  problematic  have  existed  for  many  years  and  some  have
existed  since  the  earliest  days  of  the  astronaut  programs.  These
issues  are  so  engrained  and  longstanding  that  it  will  take  senior
leadership action to remediate them.’’

These  are  sobering  words,  and  could  you  give  me  one  or  two  ex-
amples of the cultural and structural issues your committee is talk-
ing about?

Colonel BACHMANN. Please keep in mind that the makeup of the
committee  was  very  diverse.  We  had  military,  flight  surgeons,  and
health experts. We had civilians. All but one of the members of the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

45

committee  had  some  military  experience,  but  we  did  have  a  mem-
ber  from  the  VA,  who  did  not.  We  are  familiar  with  the  military
environment, behavior of highly-skilled, highly-professional, highly-
selected  groups  of  people  that  still  have  human  issues.  They  still
fall  victim  to  all  the  same  kinds  of  issues  that  we  do.  There  are
doctors and military pilots and airline pilots who have trouble with
drinking  alcohol  when  they  shouldn’t.  We  have  behavior  problems
that come as a surprise to co-workers.

And  I  think  NASA  is  no  different  in  that  regard,  and  not  to
speak  poorly  of  the  Astronaut  Corps,  we  think  very  highly  of  the
astronauts,  but  we  still  remember  that  they  are  humans  and  fall
victim to the same kinds of things we do.

The  issues  of  the  kinds  of  behaviors  that  are  described  should
not come as a surprise to anybody who deals with people. The con-
cern for us was that they are—they seem to come as a surprise be-
cause  NASA  astronauts  are  so  very  good.  It  is  still  unreasonable
to  think  that  they  won’t  have  individuals  that  have  problems  with
alcohol,  that  they  won’t  have  individuals  have  problems  with  mar-
ital  relationships,  with  money,  and  they  need  to  set  up  a  system
where they can identify folks that are straying from the path soon-
er and do something about it before it becomes a major issue.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Colonel  Bachmann.  I  want  to  rec-
ognize  the  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Feeney,  and  I  am  hopeful  we
might  also  be  able  to  recognize  the  Chairman  of  the  Full  Com-
mittee,  Mr.  Gordon  before  we  have  to  go  to  the  Floor  to  vote.  We
will recess the Committee temporarily.

Mr. Feeney.

RISKS OF PRE-FLIGHT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you,  and  I  guess  I  am  hesitant  to  ask
what  may  be  the  silliest  question  of  2007,  but  Mr.  O’Connor,  just
why would it be a great risk if an astronaut or astronauts had too
much  to  drink  before  flight?  I  have  been  in  the  simulator.  I  know
that  the  medical  risks,  for  example,  vomiting  into  your  mask  are
important,  but  if  the  launch  is  successful,  the  truth  of  the  matter
is  that  it  is  all  technical  and  computer-driven.  It  is  actually  the
emergency  landing  that  is  a  concern,  and  other  than  it  being  poor
practice, are there other concerns with, because the Soviets do have
this  tradition  where  shortly  before  takeoff  they  have  a  toast  and
you outlined that it is basically just touching to the lips, but in any
event, it may be a silly question, but what other threats other than
vomiting  or  the  inability  for  somebody  to  safely  land  if  there  is  an
emergency  landing  would  there  be  if  astronauts  were  drinking  im-
mediately prior to flight?

Mr. O’CONNOR. Well, sir, let us say we had a crew of seven mem-
bers  getting  ready  to  fly  the  Shuttle,  and  one  of  those  members
really  didn’t  have  much  to  do  for  the  first  three  days  of  the  mis-
sion. And then on day four they start working on some experiment.
Even  that  crew  member  needs  to  be  ready  for  an  egress  on  the
launch pad. Every single one of those crew members has to be able
to  convince  their  commander  when  they  get  onboard  that  they
would  be  able  to  in  emergency  get  out  without  assistance  in  case
of an emergency on the launch pad, no matter what. And that real-
ly  is  the  first  challenge,  I  believe  even  before  they  light  off  the  ve-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

hicle and launch, is to have a crew that is fit, and they have their
minds  in  order,  and  they  are  not  going  to  need  to  be  pulled  out  of
the cockpit by somebody else, putting the crew at risk.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Not  to  mention  that  if  one  of  them  were  caught  to
be  drinking,  you  would  have  to  cancel  the  whole  flight  potentially
if you didn’t have anybody to step in.

Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Well,  that  was  part  of  my  review  was  to  look  at
that launch day. Is it possible that someone could actually wind up
in the cockpit impaired? And if so, what sort of factors do we have
in  place  to  prevent  that  from  happening?  I  found  it  really  hard  to
imagine  that  you  could  get  there,  but  let  us  say  it  wasn’t  alcohol.
Let us say somebody fell down the stairs on their way to get suited
up  or  banged  their  head  into  something  or  had  a  stroke,  and  they
were perfectly fine the last time the flight surgeon looked at them.
We  still  need  to  be  able  to  look  them  in  the  eye,  have  the  flight
surgeon nearby even to the point where they walk out of the build-
ing,  and  I  think  that  is  one  of  the  concerns  that  we  had  was  that
impairment by any means is something we want to prevent.

And we would hold off a launch, just as we did on STS–36 some
years  ago  when  the  crew  had  a  sick  crew  member.  The  flight  sur-
geon  went  to  management,  said  we  got  a  sick  crew  member,  man-
agement  really  didn’t  want  to  hear  this.  They  were  right  in  the
middle  of  the  launch  countdown,  and  yet  they  had  to  agree  the
crew  member  was  sick,  let  us  know  when  he  is  ready  to  go,  and
we will launch. So he held off for two days.

DIFFERENCES AND METHODS OF THE REVIEWS

Mr.  FEENEY.  I  mean,  Colonel  Bachmann  and  Mr.  O’Connor,  on
the much bigger issue, and that is whether there is still a cultural
problem  with  the  comfort  of  reporting  safety,  whether  it  is  tech-
nical,  and  by  the  way,  I  was  there  when  Mike  Griffin  recognized,
a  technician  that  recognized  on  the  wing  I  think  it  was,  maybe  he
will address it later, in front of God and country and the press and
other  NASA  employees  and  administrators,  he  recognized  some-
body that was literally a hero because he was a technician and dis-
covered a problem with the exterior or the wing.

If  that  cultural  change  hasn’t  made  its  way  to  the  medical  area,
that seems to be the crux of what this committee hearing is about.
Colonel  Bachmann,  because  of  the  process  that  he  used,  vol-
untary, anonymous witnesses, finds one set of consistent testimony,
and he has got a very credible panel. Mr. O’Connor finds a very dif-
ferent  set  of  availability  of  communications  and  independent  com-
munication avenues and finds that nobody is reluctant to come for-
ward.  Could  this  be  a  bias  in  sampling  error?  I  mean,  I  remember
the  headlines,  Dewey  defeats  Truman  because  the  pollsters  call
only people that owned telephones at the time. You got 80 percent
to  participate,  Mr.  O’Connor.  Could  it  be  that  the  20  percent  that
didn’t  were  part  of  Colonel  Bachmann’s  report?  Could  it  be?  And
he  suggested  in  his  testimony,  which  was  not  in  his  written  testi-
mony,  that  it  may  be  an  indication  that  there  is  continued  fear  on
the part of some.

So  maybe  I  ought  to  ask  Mr.  O’Connor  that,  because  you  have
read  his  report.  You  had  80  percent  compliance.  Could  we  have  a
bias  error  here?  Could  we  have  people  making  false  accusations  to

the  Bachmann  committee,  or  could  we  have  people  that  partici-
pated  in  his  committee  different  than  the  80  percent  that  partici-
pated in yours? And that would be my last question.

Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Well,  sir,  you  have  touched  on  several  areas
where there could have been differences. My review was conducted
on  a  little  bit  different  method.  I  put  the  word  out  to  people  that
they can come and talk to me about whatever they feel comfortable
about.  I  did  not  do,  use  any  leading  questions.  I  used  standard
safety investigation techniques.

I  have  to  say  that  I  got  a  lot  more  participation  in  this  than  I
have ever gotten on one of these before. There were over 130 people
who  came  forward  or  who  answered  my  call  specifically,  because  I
did  reach  out  to  some  people  that  were  on  certain  missions  that  I
wanted to make sure I have coverage of all the flights back through
1987.  And  so  those  weren’t  just  people  coming  forward.  It  was  me
actually asking them to talk.

So it was a little bit different method. I also tried to define flight
safety  in  a  way  that  everybody  understood,  meant  no  kidding,  im-
paired  crew  member  in  the  cockpit.  That  is  a  different  story  than
maybe flight safety from a generic view might be.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. O’Connor, if I might interrupt you.
Mr. O’CONNOR. Yes, sir.
Chairman UDALL. I want to make sure the Chairman given these
pending  votes  has  a  chance  to  make  any  comments  or  ask  any
questions.

So  the  Chair  recognizes  the  Chairman  of  the  Full  Committee,

Mr. Gordon.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Chairman Udall. I will just make

a quick—some observations.

One, Mr. O’Connor, I am a little surprised that your review was
so  narrow  that  it  was—that  the  charge  was  simply  as  you  stated
limited  to  alcohol  use  on  the  day  of  launches.  I  would  have  hoped
it would have been a broader view.

Dr.  Ochoa,  I  am  pleased  that  you  are  going  to  follow  up  there

with this anonymous survey. I think that would be very helpful.

Dr.  Williams,  I  thought  you  had  a  very  constructive  testimony.
I  would  like  if  you  would,  you  said  you  were  going  to  accept,  had
accepted  and  would  accept  most  of  the  recommendations.  If  you
would,  please,  if  you  would  send  to  us  a  written  statement  on
which  recommendations  you  will  not  accept  and  why  and  what
kind of reporting process you are going to have.

MATERIAL REQUESTED FOR THE RECORD

NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee

Report Recommendations

(October 5, 2007)

NASA will address all the recommendations of the Astronaut Health Care System
Review Committee Report, and will satisfy at least the spirit and intent of each rec-
ommendation. However, there are several health and medical recommendations that
NASA will not implement as written for the reasons outlined below.
Recommendation  3.b.i.—Review  flight  surgeon  task  assignments  and  re-
structure  where  possible  to  enhance  continuity  of  care.  Consider

empanelling  each  astronaut  to  a  team  of  2–3  flight  surgeons  who  are  re-
sponsible for providing or overseeing every episode of care, whether or not
they are the assigned crew surgeon.

NASA agrees that optimizing continuity of care is highly meritorious and reflects
best  practice.  However,  NASA  does  not  believe  empanelment  is  a  solution  that  will
be  viable  in  the  Agency’s  astronaut  health  care  system.  NASA  flight  surgeons  are
multi-tasked  with  activities  that  include:  supporting  astronaut  training  schedules;
supporting  deployed  astronauts;  providing  health  and  medical  support  to  ongoing
International  Space  Station  and  Shuttle  Program  operations;  participating  in  oper-
ational mission management activities; supporting the growing review board activi-
ties  of  the  Constellation  program;  participating  in  simulations;  supporting  atmos-
pheric  flight  operations;  providing  aeromedical  certification  services  for  astronauts,
pilots, and flight controllers; and providing clinical care.

While  NASA  believes  empanelment  would  be  impractical  in  this  multi-tasking
practice  setting,  the  Agency  will  review  flight  surgeon  task  assignments,  including
flight  medicine  clinic  assignments,  and  identify  any  opportunities  for  task  off-load-
ing to enhance continuity of care.
Recommendation  6.a.i.—Develop  privacy  procedures  that  ensure  that  indi-
vidual astronaut EMRs are viewable only on a strict need-to-know basis by
those clinicians who are directly involved in relevant aspects of their care.
Privacy  policies  should  be  consistent  with  civilian  standards  of  practice
and federal privacy laws.

NASA’s  electronic  medical  records  (EMR)  system  is  in  compliance  with  the  Pri-
vacy Act of 1974 and is consistent with civilian methods of practice. NASA’s current
EMR  system  privacy  policies  are  similar  to  those  in  use  by  the  Department  of  De-
fense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. NASA infers from this recommenda-
tion  that  access  to  individual  EMRs  should  be  password  protected,  and  that  only
certain  directly  involved  providers  be  granted  access.  In  most  EMR  systems,  as  in
NASA’s,  all  appropriately  credentialed  and  privileged  providers  can  access  the  sys-
tem,  which  is  password  protected,  and  then  are  able  to  access  all  EMRs.  If  NASA
were  to  strictly  interpret  the  model  outlined  in  the  Review  Committee’s  rec-
ommendation,  there  could  be  untoward  patient  safety  implications  in  some  cir-
cumstances,  such  as  a  need  for  an  appropriately  credentialed  and  privileged  pro-
vider—without  specific  individual  records  authority—to  access  a  patient’s  record  in
an urgent or emergency situation. Impeding provider access to important or critical
information from the record in such a situation could result in a problematic clinical
outcome.  NASA  recognizes  the  critical  importance  of  maintaining  privacy  and  pa-
tient  confidentiality.  We  are  confident  that  our  current  EMR  system  provides  the
appropriate  levels  of  privacy  protection,  balanced  with  patient  safety,  and  is  con-
sistent with federal privacy laws.
Recommendation 6.f.i.—All behavioral health providers should have access
to  the  EMR.  A  patient  seen  in  behavioral  health  should  have  the  clinical
contact  recorded  in  the  EMR,  and  an  explicit  aeromedical  disposition
should  be  made  by  a  flight  surgeon.  The  full  behavioral  health  note  does
not  need  to  be  included  in  the  EMR.  The  behavioral  health  provider  can
discuss the case by phone or in person with the flight surgeon.

Behavioral  health  clinical  contacts  are  recorded  in  the  behavioral  health  records.
NASA does not agree that all behavioral health episodes of care should be recorded
in  the  EMR.  We  believe  this  could  compromise  privacy  and  serve  as  a  disincentive
for  seeking  behavioral  health  care.  NASA  does  agree  that  behavioral  health  visits
due to conditions that bear on a crew member’s ability to perform their duties safely
or  that  could  impact  a  crew  member’s  aeromedical  certification  should  be  recorded
in the EMR, with appropriate aeromedical disposition. We also agree that the policy
should be clarified to define the appropriate behavioral health information for docu-
mentation  in  the  EMR.  This  will  involve  the  development  of  inclusion  criteria.
NASA health and medical managers will coordinate the proposed criteria and policy
with the Astronaut Office leadership.

And  finally,  it  seems  that,  and,  again,  Colonel  Bachmann,  you
know,  you  have  the  most  unpleasant  job  here.  We  thank  you  for
that.  It  seems  that  you  were  looking  at  a  broader  issue  with  more
anonymous reports, although anonymous face to face, not just over
the, you know, where Mr. O’Connor was looking at a more narrow,

on-the-record. So I think this can, might play some role there, and
that is why I think Dr. Ochoa, your surveys would be helpful.

SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION

We  are  going  to  have  to  go,  but  I  want  to  ask  a  question  that
I  hope  that  you  will  answer  when  you  come  back,  Mr.  Bachmann.
I  quote,  ‘‘Peers  and  staff  fear  ostracism  if  they  identify  their  own
or  other  problems.’’  That  is  a  very  troubling  statement.  What  was
your review panel’s basis for making that statement, and how con-
fident are you that it doesn’t represent just the view of one or two
malcontents, particularly in respect to the letter that came in from
the various flight surgeons?

And  if  you  will  think  about  that  and  answer  that  when  we  get

back. Thank you, sir.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We, the Committee

stands in recess. We will return as soon as we can. Thank you.

[Whereupon,  at  10:59  a.m.  the  Subcommittee  recessed,  to  recon-

vene at 11:25 a.m., the same day.]

Chairman UDALL. I will thank you all for your patience. We will
now  return  to  questions  of  the  first  panel,  and  it  is  a  great  privi-
lege  to  recognize  the  Ranking  Member,  the  Judge  and  Congress-
man from the great State of Texas, Mr. Hall.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  O’Connor,  the  Chairman  of  the  big  Committee  asked  you
some questions and inquired about why it was relegated to alcohol.
There is a reason for that, is there not? What your scope was.

Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Yes,  sir.  The  scope  of  my  investigation  was  to
look  at  the  specific  case  that  the  two  instances  reported  rep-
resented,  and  that  was  space  flight  safety,  Soyuz,  Shuttle,  and  to
try to deal with that and try to understand whether or not we had
adequate  controls  in  place.  If  something  like  this  happened,  what
was the nature of it so we could deal with how to remedy it?

We  did  not  expand  that  to  look  at  alcohol  use  among  astronauts
in a broader sense. That might take a different kind of study, a lit-
tle  longer  if  we  were  to  do  something  like  that.  We  didn’t  really
need  to  do  that.  What  we  did  was  we  kind  of  triaged  this  whole
thing.  When  we  first  saw  the  words,  flight  safety,  that,  of  course,
raised  a  flag  in  my  shop,  and  the  very  first  thing  we  do,  we  did
was  we  talked  to  the  crew  that  was  getting  ready  to  launch  the
Shuttle. And we sat down with them, and we talked to them about
communications,  about  dissent,  what  happens  if  the  flight  surgeon
and  the  managers  disagree,  do  they  know  how  to  use  the  system
properly. And that was the first step.

The  second  step  was  to  do  this  investigation,  focused  on  flight
safety  for  Soyuz  and  Shuttle.  The  third  step  then  is  the  follow  up
with the anonymous survey that we will be doing that has a much
broader  scope.  It  looks  at  the  whole  aspect  of  communications  and
relationships  among  flight  crew  and  flight  surgeons  in  the  broader
sense.

ANONYMITY OF SURVEY

Mr.  HALL.  And  with  not  having  all  the  purported  facts  at  your

disposal, you were somewhat at a disadvantage, were you not?

50

Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Well,  when  I,  I  was  at  a  sort  of  a  disadvantage
in  that  there  is  always  a  chance  that  someone  may  not  feel  com-
fortable talking to their safety guy.

Mr.  HALL.  Well,  with  no  complaints  against  Colonel  Bachmann,
you  weren’t  given  the  benefit  of  the  many  interviews  that  he
made——

Mr. O’CONNOR. Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. HALL.—on many thrusts of this. Tell us about that, and I am

going to ask Colonel Bachmann to give us that information, too.

Mr. O’CONNOR. Well, after we got Colonel Bachmann’s report, he
added  some  more  information  after  that  on  two  occasions  for  me,
but  he  was  hesitant  and  really  could  not  give  me  more  than  that
because of the promises that they had made to their own witnesses.
Mr. HALL. You are appearing in this committee and in this Con-
gress  you  soon  learn  who  you  can  depend  on  and  whose  word  is
good, and if their word is not good, nothing else is very good about
them  usually.  And  I  think  you  took  that  attitude  toward  Colonel
Bachmann, that he was keeping his word.

Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Yes,  sir.  That  is  why  I  didn’t  challenge  it  and
treated  it  as  I  would  any  other  anonymous  report  we  get  through
out anonymous systems.

Mr. HALL. Colonel Bachmann, you couldn’t give him all the facts
because  you  had  agreed  to  those  from  whom  you  extracted  a  lot  of
those  facts  that  you  wouldn’t  reveal  their  identity  nor  their  em-
ployer. Is that correct?

Colonel  BACHMANN.  Yes,  sir.  That  is  correct.  We  acknowledge
that  they  are  all  NASA  personnel  and  astronauts  and  flight  sur-
geons, but that is really as far as we were willing to go.

Mr.  HALL.  And  you  did  that  only  because  you  didn’t  believe  you
could  extract  some  of  the  answers  from  them  that  you  extracted
had  you  not  agreed  to  give  them  the  full  cover.  That  is  a  correct
statement, isn’t it?

Colonel BACHMANN. Yes, sir. Really two-fold. We wanted them to
speak  freely,  and  we  were  focused  on  systems  issues  rather  than
any one individual.

Mr. HALL. They spoke freely knowing you weren’t going to reveal
their names and their employment to be scrutinized further by oth-
ers who had the duty to scrutinize them further. Isn’t that correct?

Colonel BACHMANN. Absolutely. Yes, sir.

ALLEGED INSTANCES OF ALCOHOL ABUSE

Mr.  HALL.  All  right.  Mr.  O’Connor,  then  it  came  down  to  you,
and  you  have  scrutinized  and  observed  many  mishaps  and  many
close  calls,  and  have  there  ever  been  any  that  involved  alcohol  or
drug  use  or  abuse  by  astronauts  since  you  have  been  doing  that?
Yes or no?

Mr. O’CONNOR. No, sir.
Mr. HALL. And have you, of the, I think you said 680 anonymous
safety  concerns,  they  were  anonymous  to  Colonel  Bachmann,  re-
ported  to  and  investigated  by  the  NASA  Safety  Reporting  System
since  its  inception  in  1987,  none  of  them  involved  alcohol,  astro-
naut alcohol or drug use or abuse. Is that a correct statement?

Mr. O’CONNOR. That is correct.

51

Mr.  HALL.  And  of  the  863  safety  hotline  reports  recorded  since
its inception in 1991, to the present, none involved alcohol or drug
use or abuse by an astronaut. Correct?

Mr. O’CONNOR. That is correct.
Mr. HALL. And although Johnson Space Center doesn’t reveal the
identities of personnel involved in disciplinary actions, the most re-
cent  report  to  OSHA  covered  the  years  2002,  through  2006,  in-
cludes  a  total  of  seven  such  accidents  related  to  alcohol  or  drugs
at  the  Center,  and  formal  input  from  flight  crew  operations  was
that none of these involved astronauts.

Mr. O’CONNOR. That is correct.
Mr.  HALL.  And  for  the  last,  more  than  90  individuals  who  an-
swered your call for information, not one offered any evidence of al-
cohol use or abuse in the immediate pre-flight timeframe. Isn’t that
correct?

Mr. HALL. Yes.
Mr.  O’CONNOR.—40  more,  so  I  would  raise  that  number  to  130.

Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Yes,  sir.  With  the  one  exception  that  since  then

there have been——

POLICIES TO INSURE EMPLOYEE OPENNESS

Mr.  HALL.  All  right.  And  I  would  ask  you  this.  I  know  in  the
aftermath of the Challenger and the Columbia accidents NASA has
tried very hard to insure that there are open, independent commu-
nication  paths  to  raise  safety  concerns.  That  is  something  I  have
been  very  involved  in.  Module,  that  was  an  escape  hatch  and  in-
sisted  on  it  and  had  money  in  the  budget  for  it  a  couple  or  three
times.  One  time  I  think  maybe  one  of  the  older  astronauts  that
went  up  there  after  he  was  my  age  used  a  little  some  of  that  to
go  up  and  back,  and  I  didn’t  like  that,  but  I  did  like  the  fact  that
you were letting older astronauts go now and then.

But  for  those  safety  concerns,  would  you  please  discuss  policies
and  or  procedures  that  are  now  in  place  to  insure  employees  are
encouraged to report any safety flight issues, and would you please
discuss  how,  if  at  all,  you  are  changing  or  revising  these  policies?
Mr.  O’CONNOR.  Yes,  sir.  As  you  mentioned,  we  put  the  NASA
Safety  Reporting  System  into  place  after  the  Challenger  accident.
The  purpose  of  it  was  to  address  those  occasional  cases  where  an
employee  does  not  feel  comfortable  using  normal  open  means  of
communication.  Maybe  they  had  a  disagreement  with  their  super-
visor  and  didn’t  feel  they  could  go  any  higher.  We  put  this  system
in place as a last resort for safety communications. Since its incep-
tion as you heard we have had 680 people who have used it for var-
ious reasons, including lack of communications or disregard for my
concern,  the  kind  of  things  that  we  talked  about  in,  today.  Those
things have been part of that reporting system over the years.

Mr.  HALL.  And  as  my  last  question,  I  know  my  time  is  up,  you,
in your duty to report to the NASA Administrator, you were, as we
would  say  in  Texas,  not  on  the  ranch.  You  were  kind  of  bridle
haltered  in  that  you  didn’t  have  the  full  facts  to  report  to  him  be-
cause they weren’t available to you. Is that correct?

Mr. O’CONNOR. That is one way of putting it. Yes, sir.
Mr. HALL. I yield back my time. Thank you.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  [Presiding]  The  gentleman’s  time  is  expired,  and

I will now claim five minutes for myself.

I want to start with Colonel Bachmann. First of all, I sort of feel
a little bit like what Ralph Hall’s comments were at the very begin-
ning  awhile  ago.  I  think  I  am  in  so  much  awe  and  hold  the  Astro-
naut Corps in such respect that I wonder why we, it is unfortunate
we had to have this kind of hearing. But I have a great deal of re-
spect, and I know that the astronauts are committed to their fami-
lies  and  to  NASA  and  to  our  country  and  to  our  communities,  and
I have a tremendous amount of respect for everything that they do.

EXTENT OF ALLEGED ALCOHOL ABUSE

Colonel Bachmann, I know that there are a lot of astronauts who
feel  that  the  reports  of  alcohol  use  in  your  report  have  tarnished
the  reputation  of  the  Astronaut  Corps  unfairly.  As  we  have  heard
today, your report included two instances of alcohol use that NASA
says it was unable to verify.

With  all  the  confusion  we  have  had  since  the  report  came  out,
I would like to sort of ask you to help us clear the air and ask just
a few questions on that. Does the alcohol, does the inclusion of the
alcohol  incidents  in  your  report  indicate  your  committee  thought,
indicate  that  your  committee  thought  that  there  was  widespread
abuse of alcohol in the Astronaut Corps?

Colonel BACHMANN. Sir, as we said in the report and as we said
in  the  press  conference  when  the  report  was  released,  the  com-
mittee  does  not  have  sufficient  information  to  describe  the  extent
of  alcohol  use,  alcohol  problems  in  NASA  in  the  Astronaut  Corps.
What  we  had  were  specific  instances  described  to  us,  and  we  felt
not  as  an  underlying  alcohol  problem  but  as  an  underlying  risk
communication,  human  factors  problem.  And  that  the  astronauts
and  flight  surgeons  were  so  concerned  about  how  this  information
was handled that they brought those to us as kind of the prime ex-
amples,  although  they  had  many  others.  Those  were  the  ones  that
were concerning most of them.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  How  many  people  on  your  committee  actually
heard reports from individual astronauts regarding the alcohol use?
Colonel  BACHMANN.  The  interviews  took  place  over  the  space  of
several  days.  The  bulk  of  them  took  place  with  multiple  members
of the committee in the room. The concerns brought forward by the
flight  surgeons,  as  best  we  can  recall,  we  had  at  least  three  com-
mittee  members  in  the  room  at  the  time  that  that  particular  story
was told to us, the instance was described.

Mr. LAMPSON. How many people were on the committee?
Colonel BACHMANN. There are eight altogether.
Mr. LAMPSON. Eight. And three heard the——
Colonel BACHMANN. Sir, I would say at least three. Again, people
were coming and going, but I know that at least three, if not more.
The  astronaut  described  alcohol  incident  was  described  to  one
member of the committee who brought that information back to the
rest of us, and we discussed it.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  What  were  you  trying  to  say  when  you  included
the  two  incidents  that  were  volunteered  to  your  committee  by
interviewees?  Was  there—what  did  you  want  to  try  to  accomplish
with that?

Colonel BACHMANN. Sir, again, we were highlighting the concerns
that  the  NASA  individuals  felt,  and  they  used  these  particular  in-
stances  and  others,  but  these  particular  instances  were  of  greatest
concern  to  them,  that  they  used  as  examples  of  how  significant
safety issues did not receive traction when they were sent forward,
that  their  professional  opinions  about  the  fitness  for  duty  or  the
ability  of  the  astronauts  to  do  the  task  did  not  receive  what  they
considered to be sufficient attention.

Mr. LAMPSON. Do you think that there is any real evidence to in-
dicate that there is a significant problem with alcohol abuse in the
Astronaut Corps?

Colonel  BACHMANN.  Sir,  as  we  said  in  the  report  and  during  the
press  conference,  we  don’t  have  a  sufficient  number  of  interviews
to  tell  you  how  pervasive  alcohol  use  problems  might  be.  The  de-
scription  that  we  provided  of  the  rules  or  lack  of  rules  that  gov-
erned  use  of  alcohol  in  the  crew  quarters  or  the  lack  of  a  12-hour
rule  explicitly  defined  for  space  flight,  all  have  been  validated  by
NASA,  and  in  fact,  those  were  some  of  the  first  actions  they  took
was  to  institute  explicit  rules  on  the  use  of  alcohol  in  those  set-
tings. So, we believe that makes the rest of the story more credible
as  well,  the  rest  of  the  situation  that  they  described  has  actually
been validated by NASA.

OPENNESS OF SAFETY REPORTING/RECOMMENDATIONS AND

FUTURE PROGRAMS

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Before  he  left  Chairman  Gordon  had  asked  some
questions,  and  I  am  going  to  take  the  remaining  time  to  give  you
an opportunity to answer those. He had said what was your review
panel’s  basis  for  making  the  statement  of  peers  and  staff  fear  os-
tracism if they identify their own or others’ problems, and how con-
fident are you that it doesn’t represent just the view of one or two
malcontents.

Colonel BACHMANN. Sir, the first part of that is how do we know
that these don’t represent just an isolated individual or a collection
of individuals, and how do we reconcile that with the signed letter
by  it  looks  like  the  bulk  of  the  flight  surgeons  at  NASA.  I  would
have  to  defer  the  answer  back  to  the  flight  surgeons.  In  the  group
of  people  that  told  us  that  story  I  am  confident  that  some  of  the
members that signed that letter saying that they essentially, every-
thing  is  fine,  were  present  in  the  room  when  the  story  was  told.
So  I  can’t  answer  how  they  could  tell  one  thing  to  us  and  a  dif-

ferent, and sign a different letter out to NASA.

And  as  far  as  the  statement  about  ostracism  and  issues  with
their  peers,  again,  those  were  the  words  that  the  astronauts  and
the  flight  surgeons  told  to  us.  Those  were  not  our  interpretation.
It  is  more  of  a  summary,  but  those  are  the  words  that  were  used
when the NASA people described the issue to the committee.

Mr. LAMPSON. I know my time is up, but I am going to take some
of  the  time  that  Bart  Gordon  gave  up  awhile  ago  to  get  his  ques-
tions  in  and  answers,  and  he  had  gotten  down  to  the  point  where
he  made  a  statement  of,  restatement  of,  ‘‘NASA  must  insure  that
people  can  identify  such  safety  and  performance  concerns  within
NASA  without  fear  of  reprisal  or  career  injury,’’  and  asked  were
you  told  of  any  instances  where  your  interviewees  had  been  sub-

jected  to  reprisals  or  had  witnessed  other  individuals  being  sub-
jected to them?

Colonel BACHMANN. Several vignettes were described where, and
in  this  particular  case  flight  surgeons  described  instances  where
they  brought  concerns  forward,  and  they  were  subjected  to  what
they  called  public  humiliation.  We  didn’t  pursue  it  further  than
that,  again,  because  the  point  of  the  issue  was  their  reluctance  to
bring  things  forward  because  of  how  similar  issues  had  been  han-
dled in the past.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  What  does  NASA  need  to  do  to  fix  the  problem

your review panel discovered? Uncovered?

Colonel  BACHMANN.  I  think  the  most  important  thing,  again,  is
for  the  NASA  leadership  at  the  highest  levels  to  clearly  state  that
they  are  concerned,  and  I  think  they  have  done  that,  and  make
every  effort  to  get  appropriate  information  that  really  will  give
them a sense for the scope of the issue. Face-to-face interviews are
not the best way to get sensitive information when people feel their
jobs  might  be  at  risk  or  that  they  might  have  other  career  con-
sequences. That is why, again, we emphasized the need for a valid
and  anonymous  survey  that  is  not  seen  as  a  mere  exercise  but  ac-
tually seen as vital to the success of NASA’s future missions, where
people will feel that they can speak freely.

If  it  is  narrowly  scoped  or  not  clear  to  people  that  they  can  re-
spond without somebody being able to figure out who said it, I am
afraid  that  you  could  certainly  get  a  useless  piece  of  information
back.  And  that  is  where  I  think  the  whole  crux  of  the  follow  up  to
this  hearing  and  this  committee’s  work  is  to  get  good  information
from all NASA personnel affected by these issues.

Mr. LAMPSON. And the folks that I have spoken with, the leader-
ship  at  NASA,  areas  where  I  have  talked  I  believe  that  their  com-
mitment  is  to  accomplish  that.  I  think  they  are,  I  hold  them  in
very,  very  high  regard,  and  I  know  that  they  are  concerned  about
safety and success both at NASA, and I know that we will be going
forward with it.

I  have  gone  way  over  my  time,  and  I  will  now  recognize  Mr.

Neugebauer from Texas. I am sorry. Mr. Bonner. Jo, excuse me.

Mr.  BONNER.  No  problem,  Mr.  Chairman.  Randy  is  a  handsome

fellow.

Mr. LAMPSON. Neither of you have much hair.
Mr.  BONNER.  I  noticed  that  when  I  looked  in  the  mirror  this

Colonel, let me follow up to the answer you just gave the Chair-
man,  because  I  think  it  is  timely.  Could  you  expand  on  any  rec-
ommendations  that  you  would  like  to  see  that  would  help  guide
NASA in the future toward a development of more adequate follow-
up surveys or questionnaires?

Colonel  BACHMANN.  Yes,  sir.  In  fact,  in  the  Air  Force  we  have
what is called a unit climate assessment that we routinely do upon
taking  command  of  a  new  organization,  and  since  I  have  had  the
privilege of being a commander for a number of organizations, cer-
tainly  nothing  as  large  as  NASA,  but  the  survey  is  constructed
with  questions  that  you  can  answer  on  a  one  to  five  scale  about
how  important  or  less  important  or  critical  or  going  well.  You  can
give them the scope, you can put a number, and that actually gen-

erates  some  interesting  data,  but  the  more  interesting  data  as  a
commander  have  been  the  free  text  blocks  where  people  can  type
as  much  as  they  see  fit  to  tell  you  what  they  are  thinking.  And
honestly, if you see a comment made once and you never see it pop
up  again  on  anybody  else’s  survey,  that  is  interesting,  and  maybe
you will want to go ask some more questions. But if you see similar
issues  come  up  in  different  voices,  all  pointing  in  the  same  direc-
tion,  whether  the  number  scale  is  consistent  with  that  or  not,  you
know  you  have  got  a  problem,  and  you  have  to  go  figure  out  what
is going on.

And  the  Air  Force  at  least  is,  I  think  from  where  I  sit,  pretty
good at keeping the information on who said it pretty secret. They
have  rules  about  demographics.  If  it  asks  you  if  you  are  a  woman
and  you  only  have  two,  it  will  hide  that  information  from  you  so
you  can’t  go  figure  out  who  the  woman  over  40  was  in  your  unit
that said that.

And, again, I would say that the questions need to be broadly or
at least start broad and then they can get as specific as NASA sees
fit, so they can answer specific questions. Are you aware of alcohol
use, you know, in the immediate pre-flight period so that they were
intoxicated when they went to a vehicle. That is one question. But
a much broader question is are you aware of human factors issues
that  you  feel  didn’t  get  appropriate  attention.  And  then  give  them
a text block where they can type in as many examples as they can
think of.

So I think there is a science to conducting surveys, and I am cer-
tainly  not  an  expert  in  that,  but  there  are  people  who  are,  and  I
think  that  is  who  NASA  is  or  should  be  looking  at  to  help  them
build a survey that will get them the information they need.

Mr.  BONNER.  As  a  follow  up,  and  this  is  really  for  the  whole
panel,  how  should  NASA  deal  with  an  astronaut’s  natural  reluc-
tance  to  raise  health  or  behavioral  issues  that  they  fear  or  believe
may  jeopardize  their  selection  for  future  missions  or  assignments?
And  especially  the  two  who  have  gone  up.  Based  on  your  experi-
ence are your colleagues, are members of the Astronaut Corps con-
fident  that  they  can  raise  health  issues  or  emotional  or  family
problems  without  fear  of  jeopardizing  their  NASA  careers?  But  it
is really open to the whole panel.

Dr. Ochoa.
Dr. OCHOA. I will take that question, and first I would like to say
that  I  am  glad  to  hear  that  Colonel  Bachmann  and  I  are  on  the
same page regarding the survey. We are planning a survey exactly
as  he  has  described.  It  will  have  a  combination  of  qualitative  and
quantitative  questions  so  that  people  do  answer  on  a  five-point
scale  as  well  as  have  the  opportunity  to  write  in  comments  in  a
number of cases.

I  have  not  actually  noticed  astronauts  being  shy  about  bringing
up issues of many different types of natures, but we want to make
sure that they do feel comfortable. We believe this survey will give
us some very good information about that.

We have a number of other programs in place where we empha-
size  to  astronauts  continuously  about  looking  out  for  themselves
and  their  crew  mates.  One  of  the  main  programs  that  we  have  is
known  as  either  crew  resource  management  or  cockpit  resource

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

management, and you probably heard about it from the aviation in-
dustry. But a lot of it is to prevent crew error, obviously in critical
situations,  and  what  they  are  really  looking  at  is  not  skills  and
knowledge  but  how  do  you  understand  when  you  or  one  of  your
crew  mates  may  be  tired,  may  be  distracted,  may  not  be  feeling
well, may be more prone to make errors. So any time we do a train-
ing session where we have a group of astronauts as a crew training
together,  the  very  first  thing  that  we  debrief  is  the  crew  resource
management.  And  so  we  are  always  talking  about  looking  out  for
each  other  and  making  sure  that  we  are  working  as  an  effective
team.

We  also  have  a  program  in  place  called  the  Expedition  Inter-
personal  Training  Program,  which  was  started  several  years  ago
because  we  wanted  to  prepare  people  for  the  long  duration  mis-
sions  that  they  were  going  to  have  on  the  space  station  and  also
beyond.  And  part  of  that  program  we  have  workshops  where  we
learn  from  previous  expeditions,  not  only  space  expeditions  but
Antarctic expeditions, things like that, how people have dealt with
interpersonal  issues.  We  have  cross  cultural  training  since  we  fly
with  astronauts  from  different  countries,  and  we  sent  people  on
outdoor leadership classes with trained supervisors where they talk
about human factors issues. They talk about leadership styles, they
talk  about  how  do  you  keep  a  team  going  even  if  there  are  issues
with  one  or  more  members  of  the  team.  The  astronauts  are  given
verbal feedback from the experienced leaders of those courses, and
then  each  member  of  the  team  that  has  gone  out  and  done  this
course  essentially  rates  every  other  team  member,  sort  of  anony-
mously so at the end of that course each astronaut that has partici-
pated  has  feedback  from  every  other  person  that  they  have  been
with to understand how they did themselves and how they are per-
ceived by others.

Mr.  BONNER.  Thank  you  very  much.  We  may  have  a  follow-up
question  in  writing  to  get  a  little  bit  more  specific  answer  to  the
question, but thank you very much for that.

Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Bonner. I know we have a lot
of additional questions for the panel, but we got to move to our sec-
ond  witness,  Dr.  Griffin.  If  I  might  I  would  like  to  pose  one  ques-
tion for the record to Colonel Bachmann and also let you know per
the  committee  rules  that  any  member  can  submit  additional  ques-
tions for the record.

Before  we  broke  for  the  votes,  Colonel,  I  was  talking  about  your
sobering  words  in  the  committee  report  that  issues  of  cultural  and
structural  are  so  engrained  and  longstanding  that  it  would  take
senior leadership action to remediate them. I would ask you to pro-
vide  the  Subcommittee  with  some  specifics  on  the  type  of  senior
leadership  action  that  you  think  are  needed.  Another  way  to  put
it  would  be  what  are  the  most  important  three  things  that  NASA
senior  leadership  needs  to  do  to  resolve  the  problems  identified  in
your report so that we don’t have to have another hearing like this
a few years from now?

So  I  am  not  asking  you  to  answer  that  today,  but  if  you  would
just submit your thoughts for the record. I know the Subcommittee
would appreciate it.

Colonel BACHMANN. Yes, sir. Will do.

Panel 2

Chairman  UDALL.  Again,  I  want  to  thank  the  panel.  This  has
been very enlightening. I think I would speak for everybody on the
Subcommittee  when  it  comes  to  clearly  every  one  of  your  commit-
ment to NASA and to having the finest Astronaut Corps anywhere
in  the  world.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  you  further.  Thank
you  again,  and  at  this  point  I  dismiss  this  panel,  and  we  will  ask
Dr. Griffin to join us up at the table.

Dr. Griffin, thank you for joining us. I don’t think the good doctor
needs  an  introduction  of  any  length.  We  all  know  his  talents  and
his  commitment  to  NASA  and  his  many,  many  successes.  Thank
you  for  joining  us,  and  the  floor  is  yours  for  as  long  as  you  need
it, Dr. Griffin.

STATEMENT OF DR. MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN, ADMINISTRATOR,

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION

Dr. GRIFFIN. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Hall from the Full
Committee, Members, thank you very much for—Mr. Feeney, Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  here  today.  I  do
have to admit I wish it were under better circumstances.

We  all  recognize  that  the  behavior  that  led  to  the  arrest  of
former astronaut Lisa Nowak, the murder of NASA engineer David
Beverly  in  his  office  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center,  and  this  recent
report  by  a  panel  of  outside  experts  containing  allegations  of  im-
proper  use  of  alcohol  by  astronauts  has  shaken  public  confidence
in NASA.

NASA is an institution comprised of our nation’s best and bright-
est,  an  institution  responsible  for  carrying  out  one  of  the  noblest
missions of our Government and our nation.

The  personal  conduct  of  NASA’s  workforce,  including  our  astro-
nauts, must be of the highest standards, beyond reproach, and day
in and day out we do indeed demonstrate just such professional ex-
cellence and dedication to our mission.

But  in  the  face  of  the  allegations  and  adversity  which  we  have
encountered recently, we must ask and answer hard questions, and
we have done that. The case of former astronaut Nowak is a matter
for  the  courts  to  decide  and  is  not  an  appropriate  subject  of  com-
ment for me here today.

But  as  a  direct  result  of  that  unfortunate  incident  we  did  last
February begin an in-depth review of how we might better provide
for  the  behavioral  health  of  our  Astronaut  Corps.  Shana  and  I
asked Dr. Richard Williams, NASA’s Chief Health and Medical Of-
ficer,  to  organize  a  committee  with  membership  external  to  NASA
and  having  aerospace  or  having  expertise  in  aerospace  medicine
and  psychiatry  to  review  the  medical  and  behavioral  health  serv-
ices provided to our astronauts.

We sought external advisors because we were concerned that we
might  have  missed  something  with  which  others  in  the  field  with
experience  outside  of  NASA  were  more  familiar.  This  review  com-
mittee,  chaired  by  Dr.  Bachmann,  Commander  and  Dean  of  the

U.S.  Air  Force  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine,  provided  me  with
their final report this past July.

58

Now,  the  report  contained  numerous  findings  and  recommenda-
tions, many of which will be useful to us as we go forward. Without
question, the portion of the report which has received the most at-
tention  was  the  citation  by  the  panel  of  certain  allegations  of  im-
proper  use  of  alcohol  by  astronauts  preparing  to  fly,  and  further,
that  concerns  expressed  by  flight  surgeons  on  this  point  had  been
ignored by NASA management.

Now, given the seriousness of these allegations, the only respon-
sible  action  we  could  take  was  to  investigate  them.  Accordingly,
Shana and I asked NASA’s Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance,
Bryan  O’Connor,  from  whom  you  just  heard,  to  conduct  a  careful
examination  of  claims  that  astronauts  had  been  impaired  by  alco-
hol in the immediate pre-flight period, as well as claims that man-
agement  had  not  been  responsive  to  concerns  by  flight  surgeons
and others about astronauts’ fitness to fly.

As  you  have  heard  from  Bryan,  his  extensive  review  found  no
evidence  to  support  the  claims  that  any  astronauts  were  ever  im-
paired  by  alcohol  at  launch  time.  Further,  NASA’s  flight  surgeons
have  voluntarily—I  would  say  the  bulk  of  NASA’s  flight  surgeons
have  voluntarily  put  their  names  on  a  communication  to  Bryan
saying  that  they  had  no  evidence  of  impairment  by  astronauts  on
flight day, nor any instance of their concerns to management being
disregarded, which has been the subject of earlier discussion.

We  take  and  I  take  these  allegations  very  seriously,  just  as  we
would  any  issue  that  could  impact  the  safety  of  our  missions.  But
at the same time I have also said that the story cited in the reports
seem  improbable  to  those  of  us  familiar  with  the  astronauts’  rig-
orous  and  very  public  activities  in  the  hours  leading  up  to  a  space
flight.

I  personally  began  working  with  our  astronauts  more  than  25
years  ago,  and  I  know  many  former  and  current  members  of  the
corps  as  valued  colleagues  and  personal  friends.  The  cited  allega-
tion  of  alcohol  impairment  prior  to  flight  is  simply  not  in  accord
with  the  behavior  that  I  have  personally  seen  from  our  flight
crews.

Now,  this  allegation  aside,  the  committee  put  substantial  time,
thought,  and  effort  into  their  report.  They  really  did,  and  we  are
grateful  for  their  service  in  helping  us  to  make  NASA  a  better
agency, and we are taking action to address the other concerns and
recommendations  from  their  report,  which  we  believe  will  improve
our astronaut health care procedures.

I  have  enumerated  the  actions  we  are  taking  in  response  to  this
report  in  my  written  testimony  to  this  committee.  One  of  those  is
that  NASA’s  Astronaut  Office  is  developing  a  formal  code  of  con-
duct  that  will  outline  the  professional  standards  expected  of  mem-
bers of the Astronaut Corps.

Now,  Chairman  Udall  and  other  Members  of  the  this  sub-
committee,  you  will  recall  that  many  concerns  about  NASA’s  cul-
ture were expressed in both, in the aftermath of both Space Shuttle
Challenger  and  Columbia  accidents,  and  there  were  indeed  unfor-
tunate  similarities  in  how  those  accidents  occurred.  A  common

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

59

theme  was  the  reluctance  of  senior  managers  to  listen  to  and
evaluate carefully concerns expressed by subordinates.

Nothing is more important to me than this matter. I have estab-
lished  as  a  non-negotiable  criterion  for  management  at  NASA
starting with those who report directly to me, that we must not fail
to listen respectfully to our people. We must not fail to investigate
and  adjudicate  the  concerns  which  they  express.  We  must  not  fail
to act if necessary.

In  today’s  NASA  with  the  approach  we  have  taken  to  imple-
menting  the  recommendation  of  the  Columbia  Accident  Investiga-
tion  Board,  to  provide  independent  technical  authority  at  NASA,
every employee has at least two independent pathways which they
may  use  to  bring  forth  concerns  to  upper  management.  I  have
made  the  point  on  numerous  occasions  that  there  will  be  no  ret-
ribution  for  employees  at  any  level  who  bring  forward  a  concern,
that  there  will  be  praise,  and  that  there  will  be  respectful  treat-
ment  of  the  concern,  and  it  will  be  adjudicated.  I  believe  that  this
is a matter of trust, and that this trust has been kept.

Now,  I  must  point  out  that  respectful  treatment  of  an  opinion
does not necessarily imply a decision in one’s favor. Any argument
or  dispute  which  reaches  NASA  managers  has  at  least  two  people
and almost always more who disagree, and it is not possible to de-
cide  in  favor  of  all  parties.  But  it  is  possible  to  provide  all  parties
with  a  careful  and  respectful  hearing,  and  that  is  what  I  seek  for
our agency.

Again,  this  is  a  matter  of  trust,  and  that  is  the  culture  change

which I believe was needed and is occurring at NASA.

Now, one cannot prove a negative. I cannot prove that no one at
NASA  is  afraid  to  speak  up,  but  I  hope  that  that  is  not  the  case,
and I will use this forum to ask once again anyone who is watching
this testimony, if you have a concern, please come forward, directly
to me if necessary, and if necessary, I will protect your identity, but
I must have facts, if they are out there, in order to make decisions.
Mr.  Chairman,  in  this  and  many  other  ways  we  hope  to  restore
any loss of public confidence in NASA that may have resulted from
these unfortunate incidents.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Griffin follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to  appear  today  to  discuss  NASA’s  Astronaut  Medical  and  Behavioral  Health  Care
Program,  and  the  report  of  the  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee,
released on July 27, 2007. In the wake of the recent incident involving former astro-
naut Lisa Nowak, I directed NASA’s Chief Health and Medical Officer, Dr. Richard
S. Williams, to conduct a review of the medical and behavioral health services avail-
able  to  NASA  astronauts  at  the  Johnson  Space  Center  in  Houston,  Texas.  My  goal
was  to  determine  whether  the  incident  may  have  been  in  any  way  foreseeable  by
those  entrusted  with  the  care  of  NASA  astronauts.  I  hoped  to  learn  whether  the
screening  and  evaluation  procedures  that  the  Agency  employs  for  astronaut  selec-
tion and assignment are as effective as they can possibly be, and whether the phys-
ical  and  mental  health  systems  we  have  in  place  to  support  the  Astronaut  Corps
are serving their intended purpose to the maximum possible extent.

In  addition,  Mike  Coats,  Director  of  Johnson  Space  Center  (JSC),  led  an  internal
review that outlined and evaluated JSC’s extensive health care programs for our as-
tronauts,  which  includes  their  behavioral  health,  and  recommended  improvements
to  those  programs,  which  we  have  already  implemented.  A  more  extensive  behav-
ioral health assessment will be added to annual flight physical examinations for all

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

astronauts.  We  also  are  emphasizing  the  importance  of  behavioral  health  support
to Shuttle crew members, and offering time with behavioral health providers before,
during and after flight. And, we are committed to improving the quality and useful-
ness of our psychological testing and assessment during astronaut selection.

The  Review  Committee  convened  by  Dr.  Williams  was  comprised  of  eight  rep-
resentatives of other federal agencies, highly experienced in the disciplines relevant
to aerospace medicine and mental health, including a former astronaut and medical
doctor.  The  Committee  was  chaired  by  Air  Force  Colonel  Richard  Bachmann,  Com-
mander  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine,  from  whom  you  have
already  heard  today.  I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  commitment  of  time,  effort,  and
dedication  to  the  task  put  forth  by  Col.  Bachmann  and  the  members  of  the  Review
Committee in conducting their review and providing their report.

The Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee’s report provided a number
of recommendations that we believe will clearly improve our ability to provide com-
prehensive  medical  and  behavioral  health  care  support  to  the  Astronaut  Corps.  Dr.
Williams and his staff at both NASA Headquarters and the JSC, with the assistance
of  NASA’s  Medical  Policy  Review  Board,  have  begun  the  process  of  implementing
enhancements to NASA’s Medical and Behavioral Health Care Program. We believe
these  enhancements  will  contribute  in  great  measure  to  ensuring  a  continued  his-
tory  of  stellar  performance  by  the  Astronaut  Corps,  while  addressing  gaps  in  sup-
port that have been identified by the Review Committee. Today you have heard Dr.
Williams describe some of these improvement plans and efforts.

The  Review  Committee’s  report  also  contained  findings  that  were  based  on  anec-
dotal  information  provided  to  the  Committee  by  unidentified  personnel  at  JSC.
These findings, which have received a particular focus of attention from the media,
allege  instances  of  alcohol  abuse  by  astronauts  on  active  flight  status,  and  further,
cite  faults  in  communication  between  astronauts,  their  medical  support  profes-
sionals,  and  their  management.  The  specter  of  problems  with  communication  path-
ways  between  critical  elements  of  the  flight  safety  support  team  is  a  very  serious
concern,  and  one  that  I  take  seriously.  Given  the  need  for  further  information  on
which  to  make  assessments  regarding  these  findings,  I  asked  Mr.  Bryan  O’Connor,
NASA’s Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance, to conduct an investigation into the
anecdotal  statements  in  the  report  related  to  astronauts  being  impaired  by  alcohol
in  the  immediate  pre-flight  period  and  claims  of  management  not  being  responsive
to concerns by flight surgeons and others about astronauts’ fitness to fly. Today you
have heard Mr. O’Connor provide details of his investigation and findings. After re-
viewing  20  years’  worth  of  records  and  interviewing  scores  of  NASA  personnel  who
are personally involved in, or witness to, the critical path for astronaut flight safety
in  the  hours  before  launch,  Mr.  O’Connor  was  unable  to  find  any  evidence  to  sup-
port  the  claims  that  astronauts  were  ever  impaired  by  alcohol  at  launch  time.  In
fact,  NASA’s  flight  surgeons  have  placed  their  names  on  a  communication  saying
that  they  have  no  evidence  of  alcohol  impairment  by  astronauts  on  flight  day,  or
any instances of their concerns to management being disregarded. I have stated pre-
viously that NASA takes these allegations very seriously-just as we would any issue
that could impact the safety of our missions. But, at the same time, I also have said
that the stories cited in the report seem improbable to those of us familiar with the
astronauts’  rigorous  and  very  public  activities  during  the  hours  leading  up  to  a
space flight.

Nonetheless, I remain highly cognizant of Mr. O’Connor’s forthright acknowledge-
ment,  both  in  his  summary  findings  and  in  person,  that  his  investigation  was  con-
ducted  within  limitations  regarding  anonymity,  and  that,  in  spite  of  overwhelming
indicators  that  such  behaviors  could  not  occur  without  undue  notice  or  redress,  he
cannot report conclusively that the incidents reported to the Review Committee did
not happen. Therefore, it is only prudent that NASA move forward with purpose to
close  any  gaps  in  policy  and  process,  and  take  action  to  ensure  that  such  occur-
rences and the possible risks that they could engender, do not ever become validated
fact.  I  view  the  findings  and  recommendations  provided  by  Col.  Bachmann  and  the
Members  of  the  Review  Committee  as  an  opportunity  for  NASA  to  apply  rigor  and
raise  the  standard  for  performance  in  teamwork  and  communication  among  its  as-
tronauts  and  their  medical  and  behavioral  flight  safety  team  and  operational  flight
safety personnel.

To  achieve  these  goals,  NASA’s  Medical  Policy  Board,  made  up  of  senior  internal
and  external  medical  experts,  is  working  with  NASA’s  medical  managers  to  deter-
mine how many of the changes and initiatives advocated by the Review Committee
would  fit  into  NASA  health  care  procedures  in  a  way  that  improves  their  effective-
ness.  We  have  accepted  the  report’s  recommendations  concerning  analysis  and  use
of  behavioral  health  data  to  improve  selection  criteria,  and  will  convene  expert
working  groups  to  advise  us  on  any  changes  to  our  psychological  testing.  NASA  is

evaluating  the  overall  delivery  of  behavioral  health  services  to  astronauts  and  is
planning  additional  training  for  flight  surgeons  in  behavioral  health  assessments.
As  I  have  noted  above,  we  will  add  behavioral  health  evaluations  to  annual  flight
physicals  for  all  astronauts  and  we  will  strive  to  ensure  better  communication
throughout  the  astronaut  health-care  system.  We  will  work  to  ensure  that  astro-
nauts understand fully the nature and purpose of all health related testing and data
collection.  We  are  re-evaluating  our  electronic  medical  records  system  to  assure
maximum utility and security of private medical information. Further, we are exam-
ining policies for assuring the quality of care we arrange for our astronauts by out-
side  medical  providers  to  determine  if  changes  are  needed.  Importantly,  we  are
working  to  ensure  that  everyone  in  the  astronaut  health  care  system  understands
the multiple pathways which are available to raise any health and safety concerns.
America’s  astronauts  have  always  operated  with  the  knowledge  that  much  is  ex-
pected of them in many areas, including personal conduct. But until now, these ex-
pectations and standards have not been codified into an official document. The JSC
Astronaut Office is developing a formal code of conduct that will be a document out-
lining  the  expectations  for  this  highly  skilled  group  of  professionals.  To  address  or-
ganizational culture issues discussed in the report, NASA will conduct a number of
internal  assessments,  including  anonymous  surveys  to  be  completed  by  astronauts
and flight surgeons, to provide feedback and gather information that we will use to
improve  communication  and  ensure  that  leadership  is  responsive  to  concerns  and
complaints, particularly those involving flight safety.

I  am  confident  that  the  comprehensive  slate  of  actions  that  is  underway  for  im-
provements  and  enhancements  to  NASA’s  Medical  and  Behavioral  Health  System
will  yield  a  program  capable  of  delivering  the  highest  possible  level  of  support  to
the  Astronaut  Corps  and  ensuring  its  continued  unsurpassed  performance.  I  am
particularly proud to be making these statements today in the wake of another such
demonstration  of  personal,  professional,  and  technical  excellence  provided  by  the
crew  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Mission  STS–118,  which  landed  safely  on  August  21,
2007,  after  a  very  successful  mission.  In  addition  to  adding  a  new  segment  to  the
International Space Station, successfully navigating demanding spacewalks, and de-
livering  needed  supplies  to  the  Station,  the  crew  and  their  NASA  colleagues  on
Earth  provided  a  fully  validated  example  of  the  superb  ability  of  the  NASA  team
to  communicate  and  engage  in  critical  technical  dialogue  across  disciplines  to  sup-
port  educated  decision-making  in  the  face  of  real-time  challenges.  And  to  top  it  all
off,  through  the  efforts  of  Educator-in-Space  Barbara  Morgan,  America’s  students
were  offered  new  and  focused  interactive  opportunities  to  share  in  the  excitement
of  this  ongoing  endeavor.  This  is  the  positive  story  that  often  takes  a  back  seat  to
the sensational in news reports, but a story that I am honored to point out on behalf
of the NASA Astronaut Corps and the teams of technical professionals that support
them.

I would once again like to thank Col. Bachmann and the members of the Review
Committee  for  their  efforts.  I  would  like  to  reassure  the  members  of  the  Review
Committee that, while much media attention has been given to the allegations relat-
ing to alcohol use, I and other NASA managers are giving the entire report the full
and  complete  attention  it  deserves.  We  appreciate  their  interest  in  helping  us  to
make NASA a better agency.

Again,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  I  would  be

please to respond to any questions that you may have.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Griffin,  Administrator  Griffin.
I  know  the  Subcommittee  would  now  like  to  turn  to  some  ques-

tions, and the Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.

You talked about the recommendations in the report and your in-
tention  to  implement  them.  Do  you  have  a  timeline  of  which  you
are operating when it comes to the implementation?

IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, I don’t know by what date Dr. Williams plans
to  bring  recommendations  or  an  assessment  back  to  Shana  and  I.
He  probably  does.  My  own  view  is  that  this  is  both  important  and
urgent,  but  it  is  more  important  to  get  right  than  to  get  done

quickly. It is important that we treat this advice as we, as respect-
fully  as  we  treat  all  advice  from  our  advisory  panels,  whether  of
permanent  standing  such  as  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  or  the
Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel or ad hoc as was this panel. It is
important  that  we  treat  their  advice  respectfully  and  that  we
evaluate it carefully, while nonetheless recognizing that at the end
of  the  day  you  and  other  oversight  committees  and  committee
chairmen hold NASA responsible for our actions.

So  we  will  evaluate  the  recommendations  carefully.  We  are  al-
ready  of  a  mind,  as  I  have  said  several  times,  to  accept  most  of
them.  We  will  report  to  you  any  disagreement  between  the  rec-
ommendations  we  choose  to  accept  and  those  that  we  possibly
think are not a good idea, and we will discuss. We will report back
to you on the implementation, how the implementation is going.

And  we  will  do  it  as  quickly  as  we  can  do  it  and  yet  do  it  well.
Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you  for  that  straightforward  answer,

Dr. Griffin.

I would like to turn to the committee’s—the external committee’s
recommendation, in particular about carrying out a thorough anon-
ymous survey that is carefully worded to obtain valid factual infor-
mation.  And  Dr.  Griffin,  from  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Ochoa  and  oth-
ers it sounds as if NASA’s prepared to conduct such a survey.

Dr. GRIFFIN. I cannot wait to do that.
Chairman UDALL. And it is not clear to me, however, that NASA
has  a  lot  of  experience  in  crafting  that  kind  of  a  carefully-worded,
thorough survey that Colonel Bachmann recommended.

Could  I  ask  you  if  NASA  is  planning  to  have  a  proposed—this
proposed survey reviewed by any external organization that has ex-
pertise  in  this  area,  and  if  that  isn’t  your  current  plan,  would  you
be  willing  to  do  so  in  the  interest  of  insuring  that  NASA  gets  the
best survey possible?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  believe  that  Ellen  expressed  her  agreement  with
Colonel  Bachmann  on  all  the  points  regarding  the  survey,  and
yeah,  of  course.  We  will  craft  what  we  think  is  the  right  survey,
and  we  will  have  it  reviewed  by  external  experts  in  this  matter  to
make  sure  that  it  is  a  well-done  survey.  In  the  course  of  pursuing
my  studies  for  an  MBA  I  had  one  course  in  market  analysis,  and
I  feel  that  I  am,  if  that  course  served  no  other  purpose,  it  served
to  sensitize  me  to  the  way  in  which  results  purportedly  obtained
from  a  survey  can  depend  on  how  the  survey  is  worded  and  what
the  sampling  environment  is  and  who  the  target  sample  audience
is.

So  I  join  Colonel  Bachmann  in  declining  any  expertise  in  this
matter except to know that it is fraught with concern, and we will
be very careful.

Chairman  UDALL.  If  I  could  editorialize  briefly  knowing  what  I
know  of  your  private  sector  experience,  I  think  you  learned  a  lot
more  from  that  class  than  you  suggest  given  the  successes  you
have.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, I didn’t drive anybody into bankruptcy if that

is what you mean. So I will take that as an up-check.

Chairman  UDALL.  Be  careful.  We  may  get  you  involved  in  the

sub-prime lending solutions.

Final  question,  Dr.  Griffin.  The  independent  review  noted  that
employees  said  if  they  were  concerned  about  coworkers’  behaviors,
they would raise concerns with a co-worker, management, or flight
medicine official. However, the external reviews you have heard re-
port  notes  that  the  flight  surgeons  were  demoralized  because  their
concerns  were  not  valued.  Do  you  have  any  specific  plans  at  this
point to do anything about this apparent disconnect?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  we,  I  mean,  I  do.  Much  of  it  will  have  to  be,
will  rely,  again,  I  will  use  this  forum  to  emphasize  if  anyone  has
a  concern,  please  use,  I  am  sorry,  NASA  Safety  Reporting  System
to  write  it  down  and  send  it  in.  Your  anonymity  will  be  protected.
If  anyone  at  NASA  is  concerned  about  an  immediate  supervisor  or
a supervisor’s supervisor, then, and that concern exists, bring it to
me.  Many  do  so.  My  inbox  stays  full,  and  I  don’t  think  there  is  a
person out there who can report back that a concern which was ex-
pressed to me was not dealt with, meaning, let me avoid the double
negatives.  I  do  deal  with  any  concerns  brought  to  me.  I  try  to  fol-
low up.

Less  formally  than  those  mechanisms,  I  talk  regularly,  periodi-
cally  with,  I  visit  with  our  flight  docs  as  I  am  at  flight  readiness
reviews and Shuttle launch operations. I hope that it is clear to our
flight  surgeons  as  it  is  clear  to  our  engineers  and  our  scientists
that not only do I want them to feel free to speak up, but they have
an obligation to do so.

In fact, at this point I have to insert a concern. If we have people
at NASA in today’s environment who believe that they can’t speak
up  for  fear  of  retribution  or  ostracism,  then  I  would  urge  them  to
go  that  extra  mile  and  speak  up,  because  that  is  their  obligation.
I  need  people  working  for  NASA  in  this  most  demanding  of  envi-
ronments  where  we  launch  people  or  hundreds  of  millions  or  bil-
lions  of  dollars  of  hardware  into  space,  to  work  in  this  most  de-
manding  environment  requires  much.  And  it  requires  that  people
have  the  courage  to  bring  forth  their  concerns  through  a  manage-
ment  chain  which  has  stated  openly  over  and  over  again  that  you
will receive a hearing.

I think our actions as a management team over the last two and
a  half  years  have  supported  that.  When  I  came  on  board,  one  of
the very first things I had to do was to delay a Shuttle launch that
I desperately wanted to go. I had to delay it by several months be-
cause  some  engineers  expressed  to  me  their  concerns  that  we  had
not  done  an  adequate  job  of  calculating  all  the  debris  trajectories,
particularly  ice  debris  and  particularly  off  of  a  lock’s  feed  line.  So
we did that.

Then  I  had  to  address  a  few  months  later  a  concern  by  some  of
our  Earth  scientists  or  some  community  Earth  scientist  who  felt
that  their  research  was  being  modified  for  public  release  or  that
their  concerns  were  not  being  appropriately  heard,  and  we  got  all
over  that.  And  I  made  it  clear  in  an  extraordinarily  clear  written
policy  that  the  purpose  of  scientific  and  engineering  investigation
is to get a truth, and we do that through argument, through public
discourse.

There have been other opportunities to address criticisms of lack
of  openness  at  NASA  and  concerns  over  retribution,  and  in  every
single case we have taken the side of open discourse, and I will do

it  again  here.  So  if  there  is  anyone  at  NASA  who  has  a  concern,
bring it forward. I need to hear it.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Griffin. I want to recognize the
Ranking  Member,  but  before  I  do,  I  did  want  to,  in  the  context  of
a  serious  and  important  and  substantive  hearing  today,  comment
positively  on  the  process  by  which  the  situation  with  Endeavour
was  considered.  I  think  it  demonstrated  the  cultural  changes  that
outside  and  internal  groups  have  recommended,  and  perhaps  it  is
the model also for what we are trying to do here, which is to drive
some changes in how we manage the Astronaut Corps and how be-
havioral, medical problems but also potential upsides are reinforced
and supported.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  think  that  process  was  NASA  in  action  at  its  fin-
est,  and  we  did  not  launch  with  unanimity.  Some  engineers  dis-
agreed  that  the  tile  should  fly,  should  re-enter  and  that  a  repair
was  needed.  Others  felt  that  it  was  fine.  I  personally  heard  all  of
the arguments on that matter, and we decided to fly, and that was
the  right  decision  as  it  turned  out.  But  the  people  who  felt  we
should  not  reenter  that  way  were  certainly  not  ignored  or  dis-
regarded.

During  that  same  launch  operation  I  had  lunch  or  I  had  many
occasions  to  visit  with  flight  docs,  and  I  asked  one  of  them  pri-
vately,  is  there  any  possible  way  that  you  would  feel  a  concern  or
an  issue  in  bringing  forth  a  concern,  and  the  gentleman  laughed
at  me  and  said,  you  are  worried  about  a  medical  doctor  bringing
forth  a  concern.  You  know,  this  particular  gentleman  said  I  have
no  respect  for  a  medical  doctor  who  has  a  concern  and  fears  that
his job is in jeopardy.

That  was  an  anonymous  conversation,  and  it  will  stay  anony-

mous, but there is a point there.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  The  Chair  now  recognizes  the
Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Feeney,  for  five  minutes  or  whatever  time
you——

NASA SAFETY CULTURE

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  I  will  try  to  keep  it  to  five.  Thank  you,  Mr.

Chairman.

And, again, I think this is an important hearing to clear the air,
number  one,  and  get  this  behind  us,  and  number  two,  to  improve
any  procedures  that  we  can  undertake  that  will  help  us  improve,
and  I  think  that  you  have  taken  it  in  that  spirit.  And  I  want  to
tell  you,  you  said  more  than  once  in  your  testimony  that  in  the
light of Nowak discussion or the Nowak incident and the discussion
about  astronauts  flying  while  they  may  have  been  intoxicated  pre-
flight, that there has been a loss of confidence in NASA.

I  really  don’t  sense  that,  and  I  can  tell  you,  I  haven’t  lost  an
ounce of confidence in NASA or in you. I am confident that in com-
plex  organizations  that  have  the  most  complex  obligations  and
challenges  that  things  are  going  to  go  wrong,  and  sometimes  they
will  be  technical,  and  sometimes  they  will  be  human  factors,  and
sometimes  they  will  be  bad  luck.  But  this  is  modern  day  America,
24/7  news,  and  bad  luck  doesn’t  happen.  Everything  is  somebody’s
fault, and I think you are learning that, Dr. Griffin.

So  like  it  or  not,  we  are  where  we  are,  and  I  want  to  tell  you
I  sympathize  with  how  frustrating  it  is,  because  there  were  some
specific anecdotes in the Bachmann report. By the way, I don’t dis-
miss  anything  about  the  Bachmann  report.  I  don’t  think  you  have
either.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Nor did I.
Mr.  FEENEY.  Very  credible  people  that  I  think  undertook  a  very
important  mission,  but  the  specific  incidents  that  have  made  such
news  can’t  be  documented  or  corroborated.  And  the  more  general
allegations,  it  is  a  cultural  problem  that  needs  attention  from  the
top senior leadership.

Fighting  cultural  problems  is  a  little  bit  like  shadow  boxing,  be-
cause  I  think  that  your  administration  has  undertaken  to  change
the  culture  of  that  reporting.  And  like  I  said,  I  witnessed  the  one
incident  live  as  we  watched  a  Shuttle  go  off.  But  I  guess  in  light
of  the  fact  that  my  goal  is  to  go  forward,  I  think  that  is  what  the
Chairman of the Committee wants to do, it is what most of us want
to  do,  and  improve  constantly  the  operations  of  NASA.  And  I  am
glad  that  we  have  had  focus  on  this  physiological,  psychological,
and physical well being.

The recommendations for the most part are not at issue that the
Bachmann committee has made, but what is at issue is whether or
not  there  is  a  cultural  problem  here.  I  mean,  the  last  thing  that
the Colonel told us is that we need to fix the communications prob-
lem,  and  yet  you  and  Dr.  Ochoa  and  Dr.  Williams  and  Mr.  O’Con-
nor,  have  said  there  are  multiple  avenues  independently,  anony-
mously that have been set in place in NASA in the last few years.
And that includes flight surgeons or astronauts that have concerns
about human safety.

So  I  guess  the  question  I  have  is  the  Bachmann  report  suggests
there  is  a  cultural  problem  which  is  decades  old  involving  commu-
nications  about  human  well  being.  I  am  hearing  from  the  NASA
team unanimously that you do not believe that to be the case, even
though  you  have  adopted  the  recommendations  or  most  of  them
about how to fix that communications problem.

Can you address that? Because why are we fixing something that
is  not  broken  I  guess  would  be  a  simple  way  to  ask  that  question.
Dr. GRIFFIN. And as the Administrator, actually, that is the most
important  question  for  me.  There  is,  I  mean,  I  think  I  have  made
it  clear,  and  if  anyone  doubts  my  word,  then  I  guess  they  do,  but
there  is  nothing  more  important  to  me  in  an  agency  like  NASA
than having an open, free, non-political discourse on difficult topics.
Because  what  we  do  is  not  easy.  We  have  to  work  very,  very  hard
to  get  it  right,  and  we  don’t  always  do  that.  But  when  we  get  it
right,  when  we  decide  what  we  think  the  right  course  of  action  is,
we should pursue that no matter what. And we only arrive at that
through extensive and open discourse by all parties.

And  I  believe  in  that.  Now,  if  we  have  had  in  the  past  cultural
problems and we are trying to fix those, I can’t guarantee that they
are completely fixed. I can only, again, entreat people to trust this
management  team.  I  believe  it  when  Colonel  Bachmann  says  that
the fact that people are willing to speak anonymously and not will-
ing  to  speak  face  to  face  on  the  record  is  itself  a  problem.  Yes,  it
is.

66

At  the  same  time,  I  have  no  mechanism  to  deal  with  the  fact  of
somebody  saying,  I  have  a  concern,  but  I  am  afraid  if  I  speak  my
concern that I will be ostracized, so I will keep it to myself. I mean,
you can see the logical conundrum there.

So all we can do is, again, create a record, create a longstanding
record  of  responding  fairly,  respectfully,  positively  to  any  concern
brought to us and hope that that record of behavior will bring forth
further  behavior  of  the  type  that  we  seek.  That  is  what  I  am  des-
perately trying to do.

Mr. FEENEY. Thank you. I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Well,  just  briefly,  and  it  is  very  hard  sitting  here  to  tell,  either
the  Bachmann  report  was  correct,  that  multiple  witnesses  consist-
ently  said  there  is  a  communications,  intimidation  factor,  or  what
the  NASA  team,  including  you  and  the  folks  that  testified  before
you,  have  said  that  you  have  done  everything  reasonably  possible
to  fix  it,  and  you  are  encouraging  people.  The  recommendations
that the committee made, whether the communications system now
works  as  well  as  it  can  or  not,  will  they  do  any  harm  if  you  adopt
their—is  it  going  to  add  new  bureaucracy  costs,  or  will,  do  you
think  those  recommendations  will  enhance  human  safety  regard-
less of whether there is a communications problem?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, our Medical Policy Board just looked at those
issues  and  expressed  an  early  view  that  our  response  to  those  rec-
ommendations being generally accepting of them was a good thing,
and  I  support  that  view.  I  certainly  don’t  think  that  they  will  do
any  harm.  Yes,  if  we  add  additional  process  and  procedure  there
is an opportunity cost of that. That means that some other activity
of  lesser  importance  will  not  get  done.  We  will  try  to  be  judicious
about  that,  and  we  will  try  not  to  impose  a  bureaucracy  in  our
health care system.

But  because  communication  is  the  sine  qua  non  of  all  organiza-
tional management, we must invest in improving communication if,
in  fact,  there  are  issues.  I  don’t  believe  we  have  the  issues  that
have been raised, and I have said that, but I am prepared to have
my  belief  overturned  by  facts.  I  absolutely  am.  I  can  assert  to  you
beyond  question  that  my  face-to-face  communications,  my  tele-
phone  communications,  and  my  e-mail  communications  are  filled
up with people who do not find me too intimidating to talk to.

But,  of  course,  I  can’t  identify  those  out  there  who  find  me  too
intimidating to talk to and thus are reluctant to express their opin-
ion.  So  we  will  continue  to  work  on  encouraging  open  communica-
tions.

I  believe  in  and  I  love  this  agency.  I  love  this  enterprise,  you
know. I love these people that we work with, and we want to make
it  as,  the  best  that  it  can  possibly  be.  I  have  never  worked  with
finer people, and we have engaged in the process of launching folks
into space or the folks who go into space. I have never worked with
finer people. They are not perfect, and by the way, I am not perfect
either and trying as hard as we can to get this right.

It  is  most  difficult  in  the  softer  areas.  If  you  want  to  ask  me
about  the  thermal  margin  on  a  tile,  I  can  deal  with  that,  probably
until  you  fall  asleep.  If  you  want  to  ask  me  how  do  we  know  we
have  the  best  possible  communications  processes,  I  don’t  know.  It
is very hard, but we are trying.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  a  great  philosopher,  Woody  Allen,  once  said
that 90 percent of life was just showing up, and what you are tell-
ing  people  if  they  have  got  problems  with  NASA  issues,  technical
or human factors, they have got to show up.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Please show up. The decisions are made by the peo-

ple who show up.

Mr. FEENEY. I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Hall is recognized.
Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I  am  a  little  disappointed  in  your  testimony,  because  you  have

always indicated to me that you were perfect.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Don’t tell my wife.

ANONYMITY AND AUTHENTICITY OF REPORTED INCIDENTS

Mr. HALL. Right. Seriously, you know, you have to use the infor-
mation you have, and you are not going to discard any of it because
you need it. You need to know what the facts are, and you will run
down every fact if I know you very well. I guess I can just cut mine
short  by  saying  when  there  is  no  degree  of  authenticity  and  no
completely  confirmed  testimony,  coupled  with  a  cry  or  a  whimper
of  anonymity,  they  don’t  want  to  be,  know  who  they  are,  they  are
afraid they will lose their job, when you got that type witness com-
pared  with  a  witness  such  as  yourself  and  this  panel  of  every  one
of these people that are testifying, and you could testify under oath
because  we  could  require  that,  and  you  would  be  willing  to.  And
the testimony is going to be read by the 435 members of the United
States  House  of  Representatives  and  the  hundreds  of  their  staffs
over  there  and  by  millions  of  people  that  listen  to  you  call  them
forth to come forth and give me that information.

Not much else you can do, is there?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  If  there  is,  I  really  wish  someone  would  suggest  it

to me, because I would try it.

Mr. HALL. Well, you can sure remember that there is a difference
in  the  authenticity  of  a  guy  who  says  I  am  going  to  tell  you  this,
but  you  can’t  tell  anybody  who  told  it  and  be  sure  and  don’t  tell
them I work for them, and a guy that steps up there and then tows
the  line  and  tells  you  what  the  facts  are  and  leaves  you  to  make
that decision. You are not so unfair that you would fire a guy that
gave you news that you didn’t like or shoot the messenger, are you?
Dr. GRIFFIN. No. I truly, I would like to assert, and it is an asser-
tion, but I believe it can be backed up that I believe that I am and
that the management team I have hired consists of people who can
hear  bad  news,  act  on  it,  and  deal  with  the  truth  and  not  punish
the  messenger.  I  believe  that  is  what  we  have  in  place  at  NASA.
If  someone  else  believes  to  the  contrary,  then,  again,  I  would  like
to hear about that, because I will fix it.

Mr.  HALL.  You  are  in  the  same  situation  of  Mr.  O’Connor  when
he said I cannot conclusively—cannot say conclusively that none of
the  incidents  reported  to  the  committee  ever  happened,  however,  I
was  unable  to  verify  that  they  did.  And  you  have  to  have
verification, don’t you?

Dr. GRIFFIN. That is correct, sir.
Mr. HALL. And you have a Chairman here, Mr. Gordon, you had
the Chairman of the Subcommittee that have expressed their belief

in  you  and  belief  in  the  system  and  belief  in  the  men  and  women
that  go  at  great  peril  into  a  fragile  mission  that  is  still  fragile.  I
don’t  care  what  anybody  says,  and  carry  it  out  for  us.  Those  are
the people you want to believe and that you have to take testimony
from, that you can rely on.

I yield back my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  and  Mr.  Griffin  or  Dr.
Griffin,  I  thank  you  and  all  of  the  witnesses  for  your  time  today.
I  apologize  for  the  musical  chairs.  We  have  had  different  meetings
going on.

Let me just quickly conclude. Once again, complimenting you and
congratulating  you  on  a  successful  Endeavour  mission.  I  think  it
once again proves that when things work you, you are brilliant.
CHARTER OF THE NASA ASTRONAUT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

REVIEW COMMITTEE

Let  me  just  quickly  quote  some  conclusions  from  the  earlier  re-
port.  ‘‘Many  of  the  cultural  and  structural  issues  identified  in  this
report  as  problematic  have  existed  for  many  years,  and  some  of
them have existed since the earliest days of the astronaut program.
The current medical and operational leadership at NASA inherited
most  of  the  cultural  and  structural  issues  identified  in  this  report.
These  issues  are  also  engrained  and  longstanding  and  that  it  will
take senior leadership action to remedy them.’’

To some extent it puts you in the position of having the push the
noodle  from  behind.  I  know  that  is  difficult.  You  have  said  all  the
right  words  today,  and  you  meant  it,  and  you  were  sincere  about
your openness. You do have to keep in mind, though, a lot of folks
don’t  report  directly  to  you,  and  so  you  know  all  of  this.  We  don’t
have to go through that.

So  let  me  just  once  again  say  that  I  was  pleased  with  Dr.  Wil-
liams’  testimony,  and  I  am  sure  he  is  going  to  get  back  to  us  on
those,  you  know,  what  will  be  done  and  what  won’t  be  done.  That
will be very helpful.

I  guess  I  will  have  to  say  why  did  you,  or  ask  you  why  did  you
so narrowly define Mr. O’Connor’s mission as to only inquire about
alcohol  abuse  on  the  day  of  the  mission  rather  than  what  I  think
are  the  more,  and  I  think  everybody  here,  you  know,  the  larger
issue  of  an  openness  and  a  feeling  of  comfort  with  the  folks  in-
volved, being able to come forward?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, there is a bit of a misperception there. Bryan
did as part of his charter ask also of each and every flight surgeon,
have  you  felt  uncomfortable  coming  forward?  Do  you  feel  com-
fortable coming forward? So that was part of it.

Now,  the  restriction  to  dealing  with  alcohol  abuse  in  the  imme-
diate  surroundings  of  a  flight,  distinguishing  between  urgent  and
important  was  the  most  urgent  aspect  of  all  of  this,  because  that
is  an  actual  flight  safety  issue.  Colonel  Bachmann  pointed  out  the
sad truth that we are all flawed human beings, and that many very
highly-accomplished people do have problems with relationships or
problems with alcohol.

But if there were to be, and I am not saying that there is because
I  have  not  seen  it,  but  if  there  were  to  be  an  astronaut  who  had
a  problem  with  alcohol  but  managed  to  suppress  that  problem  in

the  immediate  flight  environment,  we  would  not  have  a  safety  or
flight issue. Whereas if somehow someone managed to show up im-
paired for a flight, that would be a safety problem.

So with the limited amount of time to get on top of the more ur-
gent  issues,  we  asked  Bryan  to  focus  on  dealing  with  those  things
which  had  been  specifically  raised  in  the  report  that  I  felt  as  Ad-
ministrator absolutely required an early investigation.

Now,  we  have  other  things  going  on.  We  are  not  ignoring  the
other  aspects.  You  heard  Ellen  Ochoa  talk  about  the  survey.  We
absolutely accepted that recommendation. As I said, I can’t wait for
the results of that survey. I want to know. We have re-emphasized
NSRS. We, I have made person and public appeals for any concerns
to be expressed with promises of protection for those expressing the
concerns.  So  we  are  not  ignoring  the  other  aspects,  but  the  most
urgent thing was to deal with immediate safety of flight issues that
potentially  have  been  raised  by  that  report.  And  that  is  what  I
asked Bryan to do.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  just  read  it  differently.  I  read  the  alcohol
problems  as  isolated  in  the  past  and  that  he  said  that  the  bigger
problem  was  lack  of  comfort  by  surgeons  and  others  to  be  able  to
come,  medical  surgeons  to  be  able  to  come  forward,  whether  it  is
a  diabetes  problem,  you  know,  whether  it  is  a  migraine  headache
that day, whether, you know, again, you know, we saw the accident
two different ways. I thought he raised other issues that were more
important,  but  I  think  that  through  this  anonymous  and  Dr.
Ochoa,  I  congratulate  you  on  moving  forward  with  that,  and  Dr.
Williams,  again,  I  think  you  have  a  good  plan,  and  I  think  simply
by  raising  this  issue  in  an  uncomfortable  way  for  you,  unfortu-
nately,  that  it  will  probably  do  more  good  than  anything  you  can
do  to  put  people  on  notice  that  these  problems  that  you  inherited
need  to  be,  or  potential  problems  that  you  inherited  need  to  be
changed.

And  I,  again,  thank  you  for  your  candor,  for  your  service  to  the
country,  and  for  another  successful  flight.  And  this  meeting  is  ad-
journed.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir.
[Whereupon, at 12:27 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Colonel  Richard  E.  Bachmann,  Jr.,  Chair,  NASA  Astronaut  Health
Care  System  Review  Committee;  Commander  and  Dean  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force
School of Aerospace Medicine

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. In the lead-up to the findings and recommendations of the report, you note that
many  of  the  cultural  and  structural  issues  in  the  report  have  gone  on  for  many
years.  Could  you  be  more  specific  on  cultural  and  structural  issues  that  are
problematic? What was the basis for that overarching finding?

A1. With  regard  to  cultural  and  structural  issues,  the  Committee  was  referring  to
the dominance of science and engineering perspectives (over medical and human fac-
tors  analysis)  within  NASA  and  an  organizational  structure  that  places  the  Astro-
naut  Board  and  the  NASA  research  and  engineering  sciences  in  a  position  of  vast
empowerment  as  contrasted  to  the  NASA  medical  organization.  Astronauts  select
those  who  become  Astronauts,  perpetuating  pre-existing  perspectives  and  potential
biases. Committee members reviewed the detailed reports of the Challenger and Co-
lumbia  mishaps,  as  well  as  the  Institute  of  Medicine  Report  (concerning  the  chal-
lenges  posed  by  long  duration  space  exploration  missions).  Many  of  the  concerns
raised  in  the  Committee  report  echoed  the  findings  of  those  reports,  suggesting  to
the Committee that the cultural and structural issues were longstanding.
Q1a. The  report  states  that  ‘‘these  issues  are  so  ingrained  and  longstanding  that  it
will take senior leadership action to remediate it’’? What actions should NASA
senior leadership take?

A1a. As  previously  discussed,  NASA  should  administer  a  well-constructed,  anony-
mous survey to determine the extent of the issues identified to the Committee dur-
ing  the  interviews.  Next,  NASA  senior  leadership  should  initiate  efforts  to  empha-
size the importance of human factors awareness starting with workplace functional
areas  in  such  a  way  that  appreciation  of  human  factors  concerns  is  vastly  elevated
from the current state. Committee members were told that it was common for NASA
engineers to estimate that the likelihood of a human factors related contribution to
an adverse event was ‘‘zero.’’ While the Committee recognized that the NASA Astro-
naut  selection  process  was  one  of  the  most  rigorous  in  the  world,  selection  of  out-
standing  individuals  simply  cannot  eliminate  human  vulnerability,  particularly
when  under  great  stress.  NASA  leaders  should  instill  concerns  for  mutual  support,
recognition  of  signs  of  stress  or  interpersonal  strain,  small  unit  empowerment  to
pursue  those  signs  of  stress  or  interpersonal  strain,  and  an  aim  to  intervene  early
with an effort to head trouble off early, with an effort toward avoiding interpersonal
crises  such  as  occurred  with  former  Astronaut  Lisa  Nowak,  rather  than  conducting
damage control after the fact.
Q1b. How  do  the  issues  on  NASA’s  culture  that  were  raised  by  the  committee’s  as-
sessment  compare  with  the  cultural  environment  of  the  Air  Force,  Navy,  or
other high-risk operations?

A1b. Within  U.S.  military  flying  organizations  there  is  a  greater  appreciation  for
the  possibility  of  adverse  human  factors  degrading  the  performance  of  aircrew,  re-
sulting  in  increased  risk  of  mishap,  potentially  to  a  point  that  those  human  factors
issues become causal or contributory to a mishap sequence. Certainly military flying
units  pride  themselves  in  mission  accomplishment  and  take  substantial  risks  in
training and in operational flying. Commanders and leaders of military flying orga-
nizations appear far more concerned with the potential impact of unchecked human
factors than their NASA counterparts. NASA rightly assumes they have selected the
very best and brightest personnel. To the Committee, NASA appeared to be overesti-
mating  the  durability  of  that  selection  process  with  resultant  complacency  con-
cerning human factors. Within military flying organizations much time, energy, and
attention  is  given  to  the  aviator  showing  possible  signs  of  performance  decrement
owing  to  a  troubled  marriage,  recent  disappointments,  repeated  time  away  from
home (owing to deployments), etc. Every interview of NASA personnel conducted by
the  Committee  encountered  observations  of  NASA  personnel  that  all  of  those  mat-
ters  were  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  the  solution  was  to  ‘‘suck  it  up  and  press
on.’’ Four experienced military flight surgeon Committee members were alarmed at
the  voiced  under-appreciation  for  the  possibility  of  a  human  factors  related  catas-
trophe.

Q2. Do you believe that NASA’s plans to include a behavioral assessment at the time
of  an  Astronaut’s  annual  physical  exam  as  well  as  NASA’s  plans  to  include  a
behavioral  assessment  after  short-duration  flights  will  identify  what  you  testi-
fied  as  ‘‘individuals  that  have  problems  with  alcohol. . .problems  with  marital
relationships,  with  money’’  or  other  problems  that  could  lead  to  behavioral  or
performance risks?

A2. It  was  the  Committee’s  opinion  that  NASA’s  planned  annual  and  post-mission
assessments of psychosocial and behavioral factors is a major step in the right direc-
tion.  Astronauts  may  still  be  highly  reluctant  to  candidly  communicate  relevant
human  factors  concerns  if  they  fear  removal  from  space  mission  eligibility  as  a  re-
sult.  Several  NASA  personnel  interviewed  expressed  their  personal  belief  that
NASA had become a ‘‘one-mistake’’ organization—meaning one more fatality and the
organization  will  face  its  demise.  If  self-identification  of  human  factors  worries  is
perceived  personally  as  the  equivalent  of  that  type  of  ‘‘mistake,’’  Astronauts  will
white-knuckle  those  interviews  and  press-on.  Peers,  supervisors,  and  trainers  are
more  likely  to  successfully  detect  such  problems  than  reliance  on  an  annual  exam
or Astronaut self-identification.
Q3. Regarding  your  report’s  findings  that  ‘‘issues  of  cultural  and  structural. . .are
so  ingrained  and  longstanding  that  it  will  take  senior  leadership  action  to  re-
mediate them,’’ what was the basis for historical context of that finding?

A3. The Committee’s basis for the finding was based upon careful review of the in-
vestigation  reports  following  the  Challenger  and  Columbia  mishaps  and  the  Insti-
tute  of  Medicine  Report  regarding  changes  needed  in  readiness  for  long-duration
space  exploration.  Many  of  our  Committee’s  findings  were  previously  identified  in
those reports.
Q3a. Dr.  Ochoa  testified  that  ‘‘nor  was  there  any  request  for  information  on  Astro-
naut  Office  processes,  policies,  or  anything  that  could  be  characterized  as  As-
tronaut Office culture.’’ What was the reason for not requesting and reviewing
those documents during the study process?

A3a. The Committee was physically present at Johnson Space Center in the imme-
diate aftermath of a murder-suicide at the JSC facility, and as such determined that
no untoward demands would be placed on the senior leadership of NASA. The Com-
mittee met in person with two senior members of the Astronaut Office and had two-
way  dialogue  with  them  about  key  issues.  It  was  the  Committee’s  view  that  the
most  helpful  information  was  going  to  come  from  interviews  and  personal  inter-
actions. These interviews identified many Astronaut concerns regarding supervision,
mentorship,  feedback  and  many  other  issues  as  outlined  in  our  report,  which  they
felt were significant, regardless of what written policies were in place. Furthermore,
several senior Astronauts stated in person that a variety of the written policies were
regularly  ignored  with  regard  to  personnel  feedback  and  supervision.  As  such,  the
Committee opted to review NASA employees statements as to what was being done,
rather  than  what  was  in  NASA’s  written  guidance  as  to  what  should  have  been
done.  The  Astronaut  Office  insisted  that  feedback  was  being  done;  the  interviewed
Astronauts  told  us  it  was  not  being  done.  We  believe  that  an  assessment  of  Astro-
naut culture made on the basis of interviews with multiple Astronauts is more like-
ly to represent what is actually happening than a review of written documents, poli-
cies or procedures.
Q3b. Could you please provide some specifics on the type of senior leadership actions

that you think are needed?

A3b. In  the  Committee’s  opinion,  NASA  senior  leadership  should  initiate  efforts  to
emphasize  the  importance  of  human  factors  awareness  starting  with  workplace
functional areas in such a way that appreciation of human factors concerns is vastly
elevated  from  the  current  state.  NASA  leaders  should  instill  concerns  for  mutual
support,  recognition  of  signs  of  stress  or  interpersonal  strain,  small  unit  empower-
ment to pursue those signs of stress or interpersonal strain, and an aim to intervene
early with an effort to identify problems early, with an effort toward avoiding inter-
personal  crises.  NASA  senior  leadership  should  prioritize  awareness  of  human  fac-
tors concerns, mitigation of early signs of human factors strain, and proactive inter-
personal interventions in an effort to create ‘‘successes’’ in managing human factors
issues  while  offsetting  existing  inertia  and  resistance  to  these  concepts  as  having
too  much  risk  of  impacting  mission  assignment  to  be  worth  the  potential  benefit  to
the  individual  Astronaut  or  small  group  leader.  In  the  Committee’s  opinion,  such
an  effort  would  without  a  doubt  strengthen  NASA’s  future  abilities  to  manage
human elements of long-duration space exploration.

Q4. Your report states that ‘‘peers and staff fear ostracism if they identify their own
or others’ problems.’’ What was your review panel’s basis for making that state-
ment,  and  how  confident  are  you  that  it  doesn’t  represent  just  the  view  of  one
or  two  malcontents,  particularly  in  respect  to  the  letter  that  came  in  from  the
various flight surgeons?

A4. Response:  The  Committee  was  shocked  and  disappointed  by  the  direct  con-
tradiction of statements made by NASA personnel during in-person interaction with
Committee  members  versus  the  subsequent  official  written  statement  obtained  by
NASA. During interviews, more than one senior NASA physician directly stated the
findings that the Committee reported. Those statements were made in front of a siz-
able number of NASA physicians. Not one of those physicians expressed a contradic-
tory  opinion,  or  a  differing  opinion,  or  a  re-framed  perspective  from  what  was  di-
rectly stated to the Committee. It is certainly possible that those voicing those con-
cerns  were  misinformed  malcontents.  (It  remains  hard  to  understand  the  passivity
and tolerance of all of the other NASA physicians present should that be the case.)
It is also possible that those making these statements were subsequently identified
as  ‘‘whistle-blowers’’  or  ‘‘trouble-makers’’  and  that  interpersonal  factors  were
brought  to  bear  to  silence  and  discredit  their  opinions.  Certainly  our  Committee’s
efforts did not include sworn or written testimony, nor did it involve the use of law
enforcement  officials  trained  in  interrogation  aimed  to  arrive  at  the  ‘‘truth’’  in  the
midst  of  reluctance  to  provide  such  information.  It  was  and  remains  the  Commit-
tee’s unanimous opinion that the statements made about fear of ostracism and prob-
lems in communication were stated in sincerity and are accurately addressed in our
report.  We  believe  that  the  subsequent  letter  from  the  flight  surgeons  has  very  lit-
tle,  if  any,  credibility,  and  in  fact  confirms  the  atmosphere  of  fear  of  reprisal  that
was  described  to  the  Committee  during  the  interviews.  Similarly,  the  Astronauts
who were willing to come forward to the Committee with their concerns did not re-
peat  them  to  NASA  when  given  the  opportunity,  but  without  anonymity.  While  we
are  sympathetic  to  the  difficult  position  these  flight  surgeons  and  Astronauts  were
in  following  the  release  of  our  report  and  the  strongly  negative  NASA  public  re-
sponse  to  it,  their  subsequent  silence,  and  the  fact  that  this  letter  explicitly  con-
tradicts  the  statements  they  made  during  the  interviews,  causes  the  Committee  to
have  grave  concerns  regarding  the  integrity  of  these  individuals,  their  leadership,
or both.

(These  responses  represent  the  Chairman’s  personal  opinion,  based  on  the  Com-
mittee’s  findings  and  deliberations,  and  have  been  reviewed  by  some,  but  not  all,
of the Committee Members.)

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Regarding flight surgeons who reported a disregard for their medical opinion on
fitness  for  duty,  flight  safety,  mission  accomplishment,  how  pervasive  was  the
issue?

A1. Based  on  our  interviews,  it  was  the  considered  opinion  of  the  Committee  that
the  NASA  flight  surgeons  feel  this  disregard  is  a  pervasive  issue.  This  issue  was
discussed extensively during a group interaction with a significant number of NASA
flight surgeons. Ample opportunity was given for the expression of opposing or con-
trary  viewpoints  and  no  dissenting  opinions  were  raised,  neither  during  the  group
session  nor  individually.  Every  aspect  of  the  communications  made  to  the  Com-
mittee suggested that this was perceived to be a wholesale problem and not an occa-
sional  isolated  incident,  or  something  experienced  by  a  few,  but  not  the  majority.
Q2. Your  report  states  that  ‘‘Problems  of  communication  were  evident  among  the
four areas address: fight medicine, behavioral health, flight medicine clinic, and
the Astronaut Office.’’
a. What drove your committee to that conclusion?
b. Could you elaborate on this issue?

A2a,b. During  our  interviews,  the  NASA  behavioral  health  physicians  stated  they
were  very  reluctant  to  communicate  with  flight  surgeons  for  fear  that  a  perceived
violation  of  the  confidentiality  of  their  communications  (such  as  sharing  the  infor-
mation with the appropriate crew surgeon or flight surgeon) could cause a backlash
from the Astronaut Corps resulting in ‘‘no Astronaut trusting the behavioral health
clinic  staff  again.’’  Physicians  in  behavioral  health  openly  expressed  uncertainty  as
to  the  ability  of  NASA  flight  surgeons  to  maintain  the  strict  confidentiality  of  sen-
sitive mental health care information, furthering their reluctance to share this infor-

mation  with  concerned  flight  surgeons.  They  expressed  even  greater  concern  about
sharing  medical  information  with  the  Astronaut  Office.  Numerous  physicians  dis-
cussed  their  perspective  that  involvement  of  the  leadership  of  the  Astronaut  Office
would  only  be  pursued  (by  them)  in  the  event  that  it  appeared  that  an  Astronaut
had  a  clearly  disqualifying  health  issue,  and  that  more  subtle  performance  decre-
ment concerns would not be raised.
Q3. The report refers to anecdotes about risky behaviors. Could you provide examples

of the types of risky behaviors mentioned?
Q3a. In what ways were those behaviors risky?
A3a. NASA personnel related several specific incidents: of Astronauts attempting to
de-conflict ground-based communications to Space Shuttle-borne personnel amongst
the  Astronaut’s  current  wife,  American  girlfriend,  and  Russian  girlfriend,  in  viola-
tion  of  crew  rest  periods,  as  well  as  similar  efforts  to  de-conflict  the  attendees
(amongst  wife,  American  girlfriend,  Russian  girlfriend)  at  launch,  recovery,  and
other  official  NASA  functions.  Numerous  members  of  the  current  Astronaut  Corps
expressed  concerns  about  other  U.S.  Astronauts’  excessive  drinking  of  alcohol  (with
episodes of public intoxication) while completing training in Russia. While some por-
trayed  this  as  a  perceived  irritation  over  the  Russian  tradition  of  toasting  the
achievement  of  milestones  or  of  reaching  significant  agreements  (even  if  it  is  nine
in the morning), others said they had personally observed American Astronauts who
had  begun  to  drink  excessively  (evidenced  by  repeated  instances  of  public  intoxica-
tion) while in Russia. Along the same lines, American Astronauts stated that while
in  no  way  universal,  it  was  becoming  common  for  married  American  Astronauts  to
begin extra-marital relationships with Russian women during their periods of train-
ing at Star City.
Q3b. How does the military handle such behaviors?
A3b. (At  the  outset  it  should  be  noted  that  civilian  employees  of  NASA  cannot  be
held  accountable  under  the  UCMJ  which  applies  to  U.S.  Military  personnel,  al-
though  Army,  Navy,  Marine,  and  Air  Force  personnel  serving  with  NASA  could  be
held so accountable.) Adultery is a criminal offense under the UCMJ, although con-
viction  requires  establishment  of  eyewitness  testimony,  confession,  or  photographic
evidence  confirming  sexual  relations  of  a  married  person  with  someone  other  than
their  spouse.  However,  the  appearance  of  an  adulterous  liaison  is  a  relatively  com-
monly  encountered  phenomenon  with  military  circles.  It  is  usually  approached  by
interview by the commanding officer with subsequent admonishments to end the re-
lationship owing to its perceived impropriety, backed up by issuance of lawful orders
to  cease  contact  with  the  other  party.  If  these  no-contact  orders  are  violated,  that
offense in itself is punishable without having to prove adultery. With regard to alco-
hol-related  misconduct,  this  is  again  the  province  of  the  service  member’s  com-
manding  officer  who  has  the  option  to  issue  verbal  counseling,  written  counseling,
admonishment,  or  reprimand,  or  to  refer  the  individual  for  assessment  by  medical
experts in mental health for an evaluation of a potential alcohol use disorder. Either
problem-prone  relationships  or  misuse  of  alcohol  can  be  engaged  by  US  Navy
Human  Factors  Board  or  Council.  Within  the  USAF,  ‘‘Wingman’’  concepts  would
apply to earliest possible intervention with regard to risky use of alcohol. (Wingman
concepts call for the earliest involvement of friend, peer, supervisor, medic, chaplain,
etc., with aim toward heading off trouble before catastrophe strikes (such as a DUI
arrest,  family  violence,  suicide,  etc.).  Similar  codes  of  conduct  and  expectations  of
behavior,  both  on  duty  and  off,  are  in  place  at  most  civilian  workplaces,  with  the
prohibition  of  ‘‘office  romances,’’  due  to  their  disruptive  impact  on  office  function,
being  very  common.  These  measures  are  taken,  not  only  to  protect  the  individual’s
health and well-being, but to ensure safety and mission accomplishment.
Q4. The  external  review  report  states  that  ‘‘The  medical  certification  of  Astronauts
for  flight  duty  is  not  structured  to  detect  such  episodes  [of  alcohol  abuse],  nor
is  any  medical  surveillance  program  by  itself  likely  to  detect  them  or  change
the  pattern  of  alcohol  use.’’  Could  you  please  elaborate  on  this  finding?  What,
if anything, should NASA do differently?

A4. At the time of the Committee’s review, there was no structured attention given
at  any  regular  interval  with  regard  to  the  issue  of  use  of  alcohol  by  Astronauts.
Flight  surgeons  should  make  an  assessment  of  alcohol  use  at  every  annual  Astro-
naut  physical  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  the  Astronaut  to  self-identify  alcohol
concerns. However, annual interviews, lab tests or other ‘‘medical’’ evaluations typi-
cally have very low yield, even in the presence of frank alcoholism. The most likely
mechanism to identify alcohol problems is based on the observation of inappropriate

76

behavior as witnessed by family members, co-workers or supervisors, and their will-
ingness to come forward and identify the problem. Off-duty use of alcohol was char-
acterized  by  Astronauts  and  flight  surgeons  as  entirely  a  matter  of  Astronaut  per-
sonal  choice  and  preference.  Astronaut  leaders  characterized  it  as  ‘‘not  their  busi-
ness’’  to  observe  use  of  alcohol  by  other  Astronauts.  While  Astronauts  interviewed
could readily recall the policies of their parent military service (Navy, Air Force) re-
garding possible courses of action or interventions when observing a colleague drunk
in  public,  they  expressed  uncertainty  as  to  the  applicability  of  those  same  ap-
proaches  within  NASA,  owing  largely  to  the  fact  that  NASA  is  a  civilian  organiza-
tion.
Q5. The  report  finds  that  ‘‘Astronaut  medical  and  behavioral  health  care  is  highly
fragmented  and  based  on  a  medical  disease  model.’’  Could  you  please  explain
what is meant by ‘‘fragmented’’?
a. What, in your view, would be a better model for NASA to follow?

A5. By ‘‘fragmented’’ the Committee was referring to the fact that there was no sys-
tem  in  place  assuring  that  an  Astronaut  would  receive  medical  care  from  the  same
flight surgeon over as long as possible a period of their NASA career. The exception
to  this  was  while  assigned  to  a  mission,  during  which  it  was  likely  that  an  Astro-
naut would be under the medical care of the same Crew Surgeon until their mission
was  accomplished.  Many  Astronauts  spent  long  periods  of  time  without  an  assign-
ment  to  a  specific  mission.  Those  Astronauts  could  encounter  medical  care  by  any
of dozens of flight surgeons serving on duty at the flight medicine clinic. Other than
their  annual  medical  examinations,  most  Astronaut  health  care  was  driven  by  a
medical  complaint  causing  the  Astronaut  to  seek  the  care  of  whoever  was  on  duty
at  the  time  they  pursued  care.  There  was  an  informal  network  of  ‘‘preferred’’  flight
surgeon  providers  often  sought  out  by  Astronauts  for  help  with  more  significant
health  issues,  but  there  was  no  published  guidance  for  how  that  system  was  acti-
vated. Physician-Astronauts provided some medical care and used their influence to
involve  ‘‘preferred’’  flight  surgeons  in  certain  matters.  The  Committee  believes  that
a ‘‘better’’ model for NASA to follow would be the assignment of each Astronaut and
his/her family to the care of a team of one or two flight surgeons, subsequently mak-
ing  every  effort  that  those  physicians  would  be  involved  in  the  majority  of  medical
care decisions for that Astronaut and family during their NASA service. This would
enhance the development of a deeper relationship between flight surgeon and Astro-
naut,  improving  trust  and  increasing  the  likelihood  that  behavioral  and  medical
problems can be identified and dealt with sooner.
Q6. You  testified  that  ‘‘The  general  sense  of  disregard  for  human  factors  described
as  demoralizing  to  the  point  where  NASA  personnel  are  less  likely  to  report
concerns of performance decrement is the fundamental concern NASA must in-
vestigate and remedy.’’ What types of performance decrement were mentioned by
interviewees and do you believe NASA’s plans for an anonymous survey to Astro-
nauts and flight surgeons will capture such concerns?

A6. NASA flight surgeons and crew surgeons expressed belief that they were valued
members of the NASA team with regard to aerospace medical subjects such as haz-
ards  of  exposure  to  the  microgravity  environment  or  to  radiation  hazards,  but  did
not  express  similar  confidence  with  regard  to  their  observations  of  human  factors
safety  concerns  which  may  fall  outside  the  usual  ‘‘clinical’’  realms,  yet  are  often
mentioned  in  post-accident  safety  investigations  as  causal  or  contributing  factors.
Some  Astronauts  interviewed  expressed  concerns  about  the  ability  of  fellow  Astro-
nauts  to  perform  technical  aspects  of  their  crew  duties.  While  they  expressed  con-
fidence that in the event that a crew member was marginally able to perform their
assigned  primary  duties  another  crew  member  aboard  the  same  mission  would  be
fully  qualified  to  perform  those  same  duties,  they  felt  there  was  a  point  in  time
where removal of the marginal crew member would delay the NASA timeline to an
unacceptable  degree,  thus  the  discovery  of  this  work-around  solution  of  redundant
competency. In at least one instance, an experienced Astronaut expressed the belief
that human factors concerns related to the health status of a family member would
render  another  Astronaut  unable  to  perform  up  to  expected  standards,  but  would
not result in removal from a crew—the burden of this situation would be left to the
ingenuity of the mission commander to find a ‘‘work around’’ to prevent mission fail-
ure.

We  believe  the  best  way  to  get  accurate  data  on  the  prevalence  of  problems  at
NASA  is  to  conduct  a  well-constructed  anonymous  survey.  People  are  much  more
likely  to  speak  freely  when  they  are  not  at  risk  of  punishment  for  their  answers.
If a large percentage of NASA’s workforce completes the survey, it should be obvious

whether the problems brought to us during the interviews were single voices or rep-
resent  pervasive  concerns.  Clearly  our  Committee’s  provision  of  anonymity  during
our  interviews  was  less  than  fully  acceptable  to  NASA  and  much  was  made  about
the  lack  of  ‘‘proof’  that  anonymous  information  provides.  Our  use  of  this  approach
opened the Committee’s findings to criticism with regard to the reliability and credi-
bility  of  who  said  what  and  why  they  said  it.  With  regard  to  issues  identified  in
NASA’s subsequent ‘‘on-the-record’’ safety investigation (by-name, in writing) it was
NASA’s  expressed  opinion  that  their  on-the-record  survey  was  valid  and  our  Com-
mittee’s  anonymous  interviews  far  less  so.  All  of  this  said,  it  would  appear  that
NASA’s  planned  anonymous  survey  may  indeed  generate  different  data  than  their
prior  on-the-record  survey  did.  The  usefulness  of  the  data  will  depend  on  what  is
asked,  how  it  is  asked,  whether  NASA  personnel  feel  safe  to  speak  freely  and
whether they feel anything constructive will be done with the information. Once the
survey is administered, the crux of the matter would then be, ‘‘What will NASA do
with such data?’’—a concern both for NASA and for those who provide oversight for
NASA.

(These  responses  represent  the  Chairman’s  personal  opinion,  based  on  the  Com-
mittee’s  findings  and  deliberations,  and  have  been  reviewed  by  some,  but  not  all,
of the Committee Members.)

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. The  report  of  the  NASA  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  (the
‘‘Report’)  states,  ‘‘NASA  must  ensure  the  people  can  identify  such  safety  and
human  performance  concerns  within  NASA  without  fear  of  reprisal  or  career
injury.’’  How  does  the  military  address  this  issue,  especially  with  regard  to  pi-
lots?

A1. This  is  a  broad  and  complex  question.  Within  the  context  of  a  military  aircraft
mishap investigation there are two investigational boards conducted—one conducted
in  a  non-attribution  fashion,  with  an  aim  solely  to  get  to  the  truth  in  an  effort  to
prevent future mishaps; and a second to determine legal responsibility for the event,
including  potential  criminal  charges,  loss  of  pilot  rating,  administrative  reprimand,
etc.  Within  the  broader  context  of  mishap  prevention,  the  military  has  a  variety  of
processes  (as  do  the  airlines)  that  allow  both  anonymous  reporting  (ironically  the
best  known  of  these  is  under  the  oversight  of  NASA)  and  on-the-record  reporting
(for  example  filing  of  a  Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Report  (HATR)  following  a  near-miss
mid-air  collision).  Both  the  USAF  ‘‘Wingman’’  concept  and  the  U.S.  Navy  Human
Factors  Boards  emphasize  the  importance  of,  and  the  spontaneous  gathering  of,
human  factors  data  in  the  flying  environment,  the  workplace,  and  even  the  social
life of a military flying squadron. In this regard, the Navy’s program is more robust,
better  described,  and  more  clearly  structured  than  is  its  Air  Force  counterpart,  al-
though  both  are  founded  on  the  similar  concept—early  intervention  following  ear-
liest realization that there ‘‘may be a problem.’’
Q2. On page 10 of NASA’s internal Space Flight Safety Review (led by Bryan O’Con-
nor) there is an e-mail rebuttal from the NASA’s Flight Surgeons. Without nam-
ing  names,  presumably  these  are  some  of  the  same  folks  the  NASA  Astronaut
Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  interviewed,  and  possibly  some  of  the
same  folks  who  may  have  felt  their  concerns  were  disregarded.  How  should  our
committee view this proclamation by the flight surgeons? Can you make any rec-
ommendations  as  to  how  a  survey  should  be  designed  to  minimize  undue  peer
pressure and elicit the free exchange of information?

A2. The  Committee  was  shocked  and  disappointed  by  the  direct  contradiction  of
statements  made  by  NASA  personnel  during  in-person  interaction  with  Committee
members  versus  the  subsequent  official  written  statement  obtained  by  NASA.  Dur-
ing  interviews,  more  than  one  senior  NASA  physician  directly  stated  the  findings
that  the  Committee  reported.  Those  statements  were  made  in  front  of  a  sizable
number  of  NASA  physicians,  including  many  who  subsequently  signed  this  letter.
Not one of those physicians expressed a contradictory opinion, or a differing opinion,
or  a  re-framed  perspective  from  what  was  directly  stated  to  the  Committee.  It  is
certainly  possible  that  those  voicing  those  concerns  were  misinformed  malcontents.
(It remains hard to understand the passivity and tolerance of all of the other NASA
physicians  present  should  that  be  the  case.)  It  is  also  possible  that  those  making
these statements were subsequently identified as ‘‘whistle-blowers’’ or ‘‘trouble-mak-
ers’’  and  that  interpersonal  factors  were  brought  to  bear  to  silence  and  discredit
their  opinions.  Certainly  our  Committee’s  efforts  did  not  include  sworn  or  written
testimony, nor did it involve the use of law enforcement officials trained in interro-

78

gation  aimed  to  arrive  at  the  ‘‘truth’’  in  the  midst  of  reluctance  to  provide  such  in-
formation.  It  was  and  remains  the  Committee’s  unanimous  opinion  that  the  state-
ments  made  by  the  NASA  flight  surgeons  during  our  interviews  with  them  were
stated in sincerity and accurately addressed in our report. We believe that the sub-
sequent letter from the flight surgeons has very little, if any, credibility, and in fact
confirms  the  atmosphere  of  fear  of  reprisal  that  was  described  to  the  Committee
during  the  interviews.  Similarly,  the  Astronauts  who  were  willing  to  come  forward
to the Committee with their concerns did not repeat them to NASA when given the
opportunity, but without anonymity. While we are sympathetic to the difficult posi-
tion these flight surgeons and Astronauts were in following the release of our report
and the strongly negative NASA public response to it, their subsequent silence, and
the  fact  that  this  letter  explicitly  contradicts  the  statements  they  made  during  the
interviews,  causes  the  Committee  to  have  grave  concerns  regarding  the  integrity  of
these  individuals,  their  leadership,  or  both.  With  regard  to  the  question  of  survey
design,  our  Committee  recommends  a  properly  constructed,  anonymous  survey  of
appropriate  NASA  personnel,  with  an  aim  toward  information  gathering  and  inter-
personal climate assessment, with senior leadership support, assurances of confiden-
tiality,  and  an  explicit  intent  to  address  any  issues  identified  in  order  to  improve
safety and enhance human performance.

(These  responses  represent  the  Chairman’s  personal  opinion,  based  on  the  Com-
mittee’s  findings  and  deliberations,  and  have  been  reviewed  by  some,  but  not  all,
of the Committee Members.)

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. The  report  of  the  NASA  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  (the
‘‘Report’’) recommends fostering a culture ‘‘that hold individuals and supervisors
accountable  for  safe  and  responsible  use  of  alcohol.’’  What  conduct  constitutes
‘‘safe and responsible use?’’ What conduct constitutes unsafe or irresponsible use?
Does such accountability extend to off-duty alcohol use?

A1. Consumption  of  alcohol  causes  measurable,  predictable  suppression  of  central
nervous  system  function,  including  impairment  of  judgment,  balance  and  reaction
time,  to  name  a  few  effects.  A  precise  definition  of  what  is  ‘‘safe  and  responsible’’
would  prove  more  difficult  than  offering  examples  of  what  is  not  safe  and  respon-
sible. None of the episodes described to the Committee appeared to be subtle or open
to  differences  of  opinion.  Drinking  and  driving  is  neither  safe  nor  responsible.
Drinking within 12 hours of scheduled T–38 flight duties is neither safe nor respon-
sible. Public intoxication is neither safe nor responsible. The question concerning the
extension of the concept of safe and responsible consumption of alcohol to ‘‘off-duty’’
time  is  an  intriguing  one.  Our  Committee  would  argue  that  such  an  extension  to
off-duty  behavior  should  be  included  in  the  whole  person  concept  of  assessing  and
mitigating human factors and their potential impact on safety and mission effective-
ness. Off-duty drunkenness may (or may not) signal the development of an alcohol-
use  disorder  and  may  (or  may  not)  represent  a  hazard  to  aerospace  operations.
Along  the  same  lines,  off-duty  domestic  violence  may  represent  a  threat  to  on-duty
performance  of  flying  duties,  particularly  if  the  domestic  turmoil  has  upset  sleep
routines  and  caused  distracting  or  upsetting  daytime  intrusions  in  the  individual’s
thought processes. All of these issues, and many others of similar nature, represent
human  factors  threats  to  safety  and  mission  completion,  and  must  be  taken  seri-
ously by the entire NASA team.
Q2. The  Report  recommends  refocusing  psychologist  expertise  towards  ‘‘providing
performance  enhancement  to  all  Astronauts.’’  Please  define  ‘‘performance  en-
hancement’’  and  provide  some  examples  of  such  enhancement  in  other  dis-
ciplines.

A2. The discipline of performance enhancement refers to assisting clinically normal
people  to  improve  their  performance  of  challenging  or  key  tasks.  Common  perform-
ance  enhancement  approaches  involve  improvement  of  public  speaking  ability,  as
well  as  improvement  of  team-building  and  team-leading  skills.  The  field  of  ‘‘sports
psychology’’ abounds in examples of taking an athlete with talent and basic skill to
the next level of performance. Often the concept of performance involves an individ-
ual’s  recognition  of  an  area  he/she  would  like  to  strengthen,  as  contrasted  with  a
suffering  individual  seeking  relief  of  distress.  An  example  of  performance  enhance-
ment  with  potential  relevance  to  Astronaut  duties  would  be  a  veteran  pilot  with
awareness that in stressful, difficult circumstances he tends to become increasingly
authoritarian  and  issue  orders,  closing  off  discussion—working  toward  more  active

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

79

team  building,  active  listening,  and  rapid  work  with  a  group  to  generate  an  active
solution with group buy-in.
Q3. The  Report  recommends  that  behavioral  health  evaluations  include  ‘‘recognized
screening  instruments  for  the  above  commonly  occurring  behavioral  health
issues.’’  Please  identify  each  specific  ‘‘behavioral  health  issue’’  and  the  cor-
responding ‘‘recognized screening instruments.’’

A3. With regard to screening for misuse of alcohol there are two commonly used in-
struments  (CAGE  and  AUDIT)  that  would  be  preferable  over  the  utilization  of  no
screening  instruments  (which  is  the  current  NASA  approach).  Of  course,  there  are
other  approaches  to  alcohol  misuse  screening  as  well.  With  regard  to  screening  for
general behavioral health issues or for significant exposure to stress that might pre-
dispose  to  the  development  of  health  problems  there  are  also  a  host  of  possible
screening tools. One good prospect for such screening in the NASA population is the
Outcome  Questionnaire-45  (OQ–45),  which  is  a  screening  tool  (in  widespread  use
throughout  the  USAF)  that  screens  for  a  wide  variety  of  psychological  and  inter-
personal  concerns.  Another  similar  instrument  is  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire
(PHQ,  which  gives  subscores  for  a  variety  of  health  concerns,  including  depression.
Another  similar  instrument,  in  widespread  use  throughout  the  U.S.  DOD,  is  the
Preventive Health Assessment (PHA). These screening measures can be followed by
administration  of  more  focused  measures  in  the  event  say  that  an  OQ–45  suggests
the  possibility  of  clinical  depression,  The  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI)  can  be
administered to amplify that finding. All of the screening tools and tests mentioned
in  this  paragraph  are  low  cost  and  require  only  a  small  investment  of  time.  Like-
wise, any results would need follow-up with a health care professional.
Q4. The  Report  found:  ‘‘Many  anecdotes  were  related  that  involved  risky  behaviors
by  Astronauts  that  were  well  known  to  the  other  Astronauts  and  no  apparent
action  was  taken.’’  Reasonable  people  hold  differing  definitions  of  what  con-
stitutes a ‘‘risky behavior.’’ Without violating the confidentiality promised by the
NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee during its work, please
define ‘‘risky behavior’’ as used in the Report and provide examples of what does
and does not constitute such a ‘‘risky behavior.’’

A4. Risky behaviors referred to by the Committee as described by NASA Astronauts
and flight surgeons included openly adulterous relationships (romantic relationships
well-known  to  many  co-workers  acquainted  with  both  the  Astronaut’s  spouse  and
the  Astronaut’s  girlfriend);  interpersonal  anxiety  caused  by  attempting  to  maintain
contact  (during  Shuttle  space  missions  in  space  flight)  with  current  wife,  American
girlfriend, and Russian girlfriend; drinking so much alcohol the night before a space
launch  (from  Russia)  that  severe  signs  of  intoxication  became  evident  resulting  in
a  NASA  flight  surgeon  being  assigned  to  assure  that  the  Astronaut  did  not  vomit
and  choke  upon  his  vomitus;  arriving  at  a  NASA  T–38  aircraft  about  to  fly  cross-
country  from  Florida  to  Houston  with  such  notable  alcohol  hangover  that  another
NASA Astronaut refused to fly as fellow crew member with the Astronaut suffering
the  hangover,  and  so  forth.  The  majority  of  ‘‘risky’’  behaviors  mentioned  by  Astro-
nauts and NASA physicians centered upon concerns such as these. It can be argued
that  any  of  these  types  of  behavior  put  a  person  on  course  to  court  disaster.  It  can
be  argued  that  these  represent  variations  on  the  theme  of  a  consenting  adult’s  free
choice.  In  military  aviation  such  behaviors  are  seen  as  potential  signs  of  trouble
brewing, including the kind of trouble that can be associated with aviation mishaps,
loss  of  aircraft,  and  loss  of  lives,  thus  they  are  seen  as  the  appropriate  province  of
friend, wingman, and commander with an eye toward mitigation of risk.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Richard S. Williams, Chief Health and Medical Officer, National Aero-

nautics and Space Administration

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Could you please submit for the record which recommendations of the NASA As-

tronaut Health Care System Review Committee you will not accept and why?
a. What kind of reporting process will you use?

A1. NASA  has  developed  a  comprehensive  response  plan  that  integrates  rec-
ommendations  and  actions  from  all  three  existing  reports:  the  NASA  Astronaut
Health  Care  System  Review  Committee,  the  Space  Flight  Safety  Review  of  Alcohol
Use  in  the  Pre-Flight  Period,  and  the  Johnson  Space  Center  Internal  Review.
Progress  will  be  reviewed  quarterly  by  the  Medical  Policy  Board,  and  a  briefing  to
the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel is anticipated early next year.
Q2. Your  testimony  notes  that  ‘‘External  review  of  our  behavioral  medicine  services
was  performed  in  February  2007.  This  review  determined  that  NASA  provided
a  competent  group  of  behavioral  health  providers  (BHP)  rendering  excellent
clinical  and  occupational  care.  Recommendations  were  also  made  for  improve-
ment,  and  actions  were  in  place  to  address  many  of  these  areas  at  the  time  of
Dr.  Bachmann’s  review.’’  Who  conducted  the  February  2007  external  review  of
behavioral  medicine  services,  what  was  the  charge  to  the  reviewers,  what  were
the  main  recommendations,  and  why  did  NASA  perceive  the  need  to  solicit  an
additional independent review of astronaut health care?

A2. The  February  2007  review  was  conducted  by  Dr.  Royden  W.  Marsh,  employed
by  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (USAF)  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine  on  the  Psychiatry  con-
sultation  service.  Dr.  Marsh  was  known  to  NASA  behavioral  medicine  staff  and  is
an  experienced  aerospace  medicine  practitioner,  having  worked  for  many  years  in
support  of  USAF  aeromedical  behavioral  health  services  and  having  previously
worked at Johnson Space Center. Dr. Marsh conducted his quality review of the Be-
havioral Health office and clinical care on February 28 and March 1, 2007. This re-
view  was  conducted  as  part  of  NASA’s  overall  program  to  insure  quality  of  astro-
naut  health  care  services.  The  scope  of  the  review  included  credentialing,  privi-
leging, primary source verification, internal peer review, and external quality review
of  office  procedures,  medical  record-keeping,  and  review  of  clinical  care.  Such  a  re-
view  is  also  done  on  a  regular  basis  for  the  Flight  Medicine  Clinic.  It  should  be
noted that the preparations for this review were initiated in January 2007, approxi-
mately one month before the event involving Lisa Nowak.

The  main  recommendations  from  the  review  were  related  to  credentialing  and
privileging,  and  external  peer  review.  Dr.  Marsh  recommended  several  improve-
ments to our credentialing and privileging procedures which have been incorporated.
He  also  recommended  formalization  of  external  consultant  peer  review  by  an  aero-
space psychiatry consultant, and implementation of a formalized, quarterly, internal
peer  review  process  to  enhance  review  of  the  Behavioral  Medicine  Clinic.  NASA
agreed with this recommendation and has incorporated it in our planning.
Q3. Col.  Bachmann’s  testimony  noted  that  one  of  the  three  most  important  issues
identified by the external review is that ‘‘medical and behavioral health services
should  be  integrated  and  focused  on  astronaut  performance  enhancement.’’
What  steps,  if  any,  does  NASA  plan  to  take  with  regard  to  using  medical  and
behavioral health services to enhance astronaut performance?

A3. NASA  has  accepted  this  recommendation  and  is  now  considering  the  appro-
priate  changes  to  its  services  through  its  comprehensive  response  to  the  NASA  As-
tronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  Report.  The  changes  are  being  de-
veloped, and will be reviewed later this fiscal year by the Chief Health and Medical
Officer’s Medical Policy Board, a joint internal and external medical advisory group,
whose members are senior physicians from NASA and other federal agencies.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your testimony refers to the creation of the Office of the Chief Health and Med-
ical Officer in 2000 as a result of recommendations of external advisory groups.
Who  were  those  groups,  and  why  did  they  see  the  need  to  set  up  your  office—
what problem were they trying to fix?

81

A1. Prior to the establishment of the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer,
this function existed within the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and the Of-
fice  of  Space  Flight.  The  functional  entity  thus  did  not  constitute  an  Agency-wide
authority, and influence that could be exercised on behalf of health and medical pol-
icy  and  oversight  and  protection  of  research  subjects  was  limited.  In  1998,  NASA
requested that the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) review
NASA’s biomedical structure for transitioning from low-Earth orbit operations to ex-
ploration class human space flight missions to Mars. The IOM completed their study
over the next two years and published Safe Passage: Astronaut Care for Exploration
Missions  (2001).  The  IOM  suggested  a  central  authority  responsible  for  all  NASA
health  and  medical  matters  be  developed  The  IOM  specifically  recommended:  ‘‘To
support  safe  human  exploration  of  space,  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Ad-
ministration  (NASA)  should  pursue  a  two-component  strategy:  (1)  it  should  pursue
a  comprehensive  health  care  system  for  astronauts  to  capture  all  relevant  epidemio-
logical data, and (2) it should pursue a long-term, focused health care research strat-
egy to capture all necessary data on health risks and their amelioration. An occupa-
tional health model should apply to the first pursuit. . . To accomplish this strategy,
there  should  be  an  organizational  component  within  NASA  that  has  authority  over
and accountability.for all aspects of astronaut health.’’

The  Aerospace  Medicine  and  Occupational  Health  Advisory  Committee
(AMOHAC)  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  (NAC)  (as  constituted  at  that  time)  also
recommended that the position of NASA Chief Medical Officer, at the NASA Admin-
istrator’s  staff  level,  be  established.  Establishing  such  a  position  (with  responsible
staff)  elevates  cognizance  of  the  importance  of  health  and  medical  issues  at  the
Agency  level,  clearly  establishes  policy  and  oversight  authority  for  NASA’s  health
care delivery efforts, and clearly establishes functional responsibility for health risk
assessment  and  health  standards  definition.  This  allows  effective  oversight  of  all
health related issues within the Agency, and, through health and medical standards
development,  provides  guidance  to  NASA’s  biomedical  research  program  in  support
of human space flight and the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA’s current govern-
ance  model,  which  established  technical  authorities  (including  Health  and  Medical
Technical  Authority),  is  well  served  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Health  and  Medical
Officer,  in  parallel  with  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Engineer  and  the  Office  of  Safety
and Mission Assurance.
Q2. Are alcoholism, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse/addiction encompassed in the es-
tablished  medical  standards  for  fitness  for  flight  and  fitness  for  duty?  If  not,
why not?
a. Can  flight  surgeons  ground  an  astronaut  due  to  behavioral  health  and  has

this ever occurred?

A2. Yes,  these  issues  are  addressed  by  established  medical  standards.  Flight  sur-
geons can ground an astronaut for failing any aeromedical standard, including those
covering  behavioral  health  issues.  NASA  has  never  grounded  an  astronaut  (denied
a waiver) or allowed an astronaut to fly (issued a waiver) for failing to meet behav-
ioral health standards.
Q3. How are astronaut problems that do not violate a behavioral standard (debt due
to  gambling,  infidelity,  etc.)  but  that  could  pose  behavioral  and  performance
risks over time, handled?

A3. All NASA employees are subject to supervisory evaluation for maintaining work
proficiency.  This  means  that  unless  a  person  is  incapacitated  to  a  degree  that  they
are  not  able  to  perform  their  job  to  their  supervisor’s  satisfaction,  no  additional  di-
rect  intercession  is  done  without  the  explicit  initiation  and  consent  by  the  affected
employee.  However,  the  NASA  Occupational  Health  Program  promotes  continued
employee  education  related  to  stress  at  work,  alcohol  or  other  substance  use  or
abuse,  and  other  health  issues.  NASA,  encourages  employees  to  seek  help,  and
makes  available  an  Employee  Assistance  Program.  Additional  resources  are  avail-
able for astronauts and their families through the Behavioral Health Program. New
processes  are  being  developed  to  include  an  annual  behavioral  health  exam  for  as-
tronauts  that  should  make  behavioral  health  encounters  routine  and  foster  more
communication between care providers and the astronauts.
Q4. The  external  review  notes  that  ‘‘Astronauts  are  not  required  to  report  illnesses,
injuries or medication use unless they determine them to be significant.’’ What
is the reason for this practice?
a. What protections exist to ensure that astronauts are not impaired by medica-

tion use that may not have been reported to flight surgeons?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

82

A4. This  practice  is  consistent  with  other  aeromedical  systems  including  the  FAA.
The  astronaut  is  required  to  report  any  medical  issue  including  medication  that
might  represent  a  safety  of  flight  issue,  but  not  all  over  the  counter  medications
that  arc  approved  for  flight  status  need  to  be  reported.  During  the  launch  process,
medical  examinations  and  laboratory  evaluations  are  conducted  10  days  and  two
days prior to launch.
Q5. NASA  has  announced  that  it  is  accepting  applications  for  the  2009  astronaut
class. With the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010, the astronaut class of 2009 will
be conducting longer-duration missions, making behavioral health an even more
important factor for astronaut crews. Could you please describe in specific terms
if  the  behavioral  aspects  of  the  selection  process  are  being  modified  in  response
to the independent health care system review, and if so, in what ways?

A5. NASA  is  reviewing  its  behavioral  health  data  to  determine  if  changes  need  to
be made to its process in light of the findings of the Astronaut Health Care System
Review  Committee  and  corresponding  internal  NASA  reviews.  Any  recommenda-
tions for change would be evaluated prior to the next scheduled selection.
Q6. Your  testimony  notes  that  several  aspects  of  the  Independent  Astronaut  Health
Care  Review  are  being  assessed  and  examined.  What  is  the  plan  and  schedule,
and how will progress be monitored?

A6. NASA  has  developed  a  comprehensive  response  plan  that  integrates  rec-
ommendations  and  actions  from  all  three  existing  reports  (NASA  Astronaut  Health
Care  System  Review  Committee  report,  the  Space  Flight  Safety  Review  of  Alcohol
Use  in  the  Pre-Flight  Period,  and  the  JSC  Internal  Review).  Progress  will  be  re-
viewed quarterly by the Medical Policy Board (MPB) and a briefing to the Aerospace
Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) is anticipated early next year.

Questions submitted by Representative Jo Bonner
Q1. If  astronauts  have  been  conditioned  to  view  emotional  problems  as  weaknesses
to  be  suppressed  and  compartmentalized,  of  if  they  perceive  that  disclosing  per-
sonal problems could derail their careers, they will understandably be reluctant
to  seek  psychological  counseling.  How  do  you  foster  a  supportive,  trusting  rela-
tionship between the astronauts and the behavioral health specialists?

A1. Several  approaches,  outlined  below,  are  being  pursued  to  foster  a  supportive
and trusting relationship between the astronauts and the behavioral health special-
ists.

1) The  behavioral  health  clinic  is  separate  from  the  flight  medicine  clinic  to

maintain privacy.

2) Privacy  Act  regulations  are  followed  to  further  maintain  the  privacy  of  be-

havioral health visits.

3) The  behavioral  health  clinic  is  available  for  the  astronaut  dependents  as
well.  Thus  the  whole  family  can  get  the  appropriate  psychological  support.
4) New  processes  are  being  developed  to  include  an  annual  behavioral  health
exam  for  astronauts  that  should  make  behavioral  health  encounters  routine
and  foster  more  communication  between  care  providers  and  the  astronauts.
Q2. The  Committee’s  Report  states  that  NASA  has  to  grapple  with  many  cultural
and  structural  issues,  some  of  which  have  existed  since  the  earliest  days  of  the
astronaut  program.  Do  you  agree  with  this  assessment?  If  yes,  what  steps  will
you take to change such deeply ingrained behaviors?

A2. NASA  has  made  many  cultural  and  structural  changes  based  on  the  Columbia
Accident Investigation (CRIB) report recommendations (which have been previously
reported to the Congress). To determine if there are other specific cultural or struc-
tural issues that need to be changed, NASA is first pursuing an anonymous survey
to  further  characterize  issues  related  to  cultural  and  structural  issues  within  the
Astronaut  Corps  and  within  the  cadre  of  flight  surgeons.  The  survey  is  focused  on
communication, trust and decision-making. Results of this survey will be utilized to
guide any needed changes to address issues of concern with the astronaut and med-
ical communities.

From  an  Agency  perspective,  it  is  widely  recognized  that  improvement  in  safety
culture  can  be  derived  from  improvements  in  the  safety  climate  through  active  su-
pervisory and peer involvement. The safety climate of an organization is defined by
many  factors  including  technical  knowledge  and  behavior  of  its  members  with  re-
gard  to  safety.  This  includes  opportunities  for  personnel  exposure  to  safety  prin-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:32 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 037640 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\090607\37640 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

ciples and practices, dissemination of safety lessons learned, the ease of safety com-
munication  up  and  down  the  organization,  and  the  consideration  of  safety  in  man-
agement decisions.

NASA  is  pursuing  a  multi-faceted  approach  for  improving  safety  climate  across

the Agency that will include the astronaut corp. This approach is based on:

• Integration  of  safety  management  with  programmatic  and  engineering  deci-
• Achieving technical excellence in safety and mission assurance activities

sion processes

The  former  is  being  implemented  through  NASA’s  governance  model.  The  latter
is  being  addressed  by  establishing  the  NASA  Safety  Center  (NSC)  to  expand  and
strengthen the safety training element of NASA’s safety program. Each approach is
briefly discussed below:
NASA Governance Model—Over the past several years NASA has been defining and
implementing an overall governance model that is based on: (1) responsible decision-
making;  (2)  a  balance  of  power;  and;  (3)  the  establishment  of  checks  and  balances.
These  elements  and  the  practices  are  a  direct  outgrowth  of  the  Columbia  Accident
Investigation  Board  (CAIB)  findings  and  establish  a  framework  for  a  safety  culture
to  grow  and  thrive.  These  three  elements  permit  ongoing  lively  discussion  and  de-
bate to occur unfettered at all levels within the NASA organization. The NASA Ad-
ministrator  has  set  the  overall  tone  for  these  discussions  and  debates  by  consist-
ently challenging decisions and established policies looking for new ways to answer
questions,  and  NASA  has  codified  a  formal  process  for  dissent  in  NASA  Procedural
Requirements  7120.51),  NASA  Space  Flight  Program  and  Project  Management  Re-
quirements.  The  visibility  and  clear  definition  of  the  overall  decision  process  along
with  the  examples  of  these  processes  set  at  the  highest  level  of  the  Agency  in  the
Program  Management  Council  and  other  top  level  councils  establishes  the  bench-
mark for the rest of the Agency to follow. Even so, NASA recognizes that even with
these concepts documented and regularly exercised, there will be people that remain
uncomfortable even in the most open of organizational safety climates. Some of that
lack  of  comfort  might  be  attributed  to  a  lack  of  technical  competency  or  standing
among  one’s  peers  or  from  lack  of  confidence  in  the  openness  of  management.  As
discussed  in  the  following  paragraphs  NASA  is  taking  steps  to  increase  the  com-
petence (and confidence in the competence) of the NASA workforce relating to safety
and  mission  assurance  disciplines  through  the  Technical  Excellence  activities,  and
we  are  also  developing  the  capability  to  measure  the  overall  climate  with  respect
to safety.
Achieving  Technical  Excellence  in  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance—NASA  is  com-
mitted to increase the awareness and concern for safety at all levels beginning with
system  safety  in  design  and  facility  operations  to  astronauts  and  flight  operations.
Increased excellence and awareness in safety are necessary ingredients for strength-
ening  our  safety  culture.  The  Technical  Excellence  Program  being  developed  at  the
NSC will conduct educational programs to raise safety awareness, disseminate safe-
ty  lessons  learned,  and  increase  the  safety  emphasis  of  NASA  management  and
staff.  Safety  engineering  and  management  courses  that  are  being  planned  will  ad-
dress not only safety in the operational and design environment but also philosophy
and  doctrine  that  influence  the  various  management  and  technical  levels  at  NASA.
We believe that the envisioned Technical Excellence Program will not only increase
the safety competency of our workforce but will also increase management’s aware-
ness of the benefits that derive from sound safety management and safety engineer-
ing principles and processes being applied uniformly across the Agency.
Measuring  and  Communicating  Safety  Culture  Using  a  Standard  Process—Recog-
nizing the importance of safety culture, our Office of Safety and Mission Assurance
(OSMA),  over  the  past  two  years,  has  developed  and  maintained  contacts  with  sev-
eral  faculty  members  of  the  Naval  Postgraduate  School  (NPS)  and  the  University
of California at Berkeley (UCB) who have developed a web-based safety climate sur-
vey  tool  for  the  Naval  Aviation  School.  Recognizing  the  difficulty  inherent  in  meas-
uring safety culture, this tool uses safety climate metrics as an indicator of cultural
strengths  and  weaknesses.  After  several  exchanges  of  information  and  views  be-
tween  the  OSMA  and  the  NPS/UCB  faculty,  it  was  decided  that  a  proof-of-concept
should be undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of using a similar tool at NASA.
The  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC)  volunteered  to  participate  in  the  first
pilot study just completed. On August 24, 2007, the preliminary results of this pilot
project  were  presented  to  OSMA.  OSMA  is  currently  evaluating  the  results  of  this
study  and  is  planning  to  conduct  a  series  of  additional  pilot  studies.  These  studies
will  allow  OSMA  to  incrementally  arrive  at  an  Agency-wide  safety  culture  shaping

and measurement process that will be effective for both design and operational envi-
ronments  at  NASA.  OSMA  is  also  investigating  whether  this  process  will  allow
NASA  on-site  contractors  to  participate  on  a  voluntary  basis;  contractor  participa-
tion  may  be  dependent  on  the  specific  contract.  To  this  end,  the  activities  outlined
below are being pursued by OSMA.

• Examine  the  results  of  the  GSFC  study  and  past  safety  culture  assessment
and  shaping  processes  performed  at  NASA  as  well  as  in  other  government
and  non-government  organizations  to  determine  best  practices  and  analyze
what practices could be adapted for NASA use.
• Develop  a  safety  culture  assessment  and  shaping  process,  or  adapt/refine  a
currently  employed  process  for  NASA  use  that  incorporates  the  applicable
government and industry best practices. This process will include methods to
educate Center leadership on the process, measure safety climate, analyze the
survey data, and advise NASA Headquarters and Center leadership as to the
results and recommended strategies to strengthen safety culture.

Together,  these  efforts  will  allow  NASA  to  address  many  cultural  and  structural
issues, some of which have existed since the earliest days of the astronaut program.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Ellen  Ochoa,  Director,  Flight  Crew  Operations,  NASA  Johnson  Space

Center

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. NASA has noted that it is working with astronauts to develop a code of conduct.

Could you please describe what the code of conduct is expected to entail?
a. How  will  it  be  communicated  to  new  and  current  astronauts  and  how  will

it be enforced?

A1. At  NASA  we  not  only  abide  by  code  of  ethics  regulations  for  executive  branch
employees,  we  also  have  documented  core  Values  for  all  of  us  including  our  Astro-
naut  Corps.  These  include  safety,  teamwork,  integrity,  and  mission  success.  Any-
thing  we  develop  will  be  further  definitions  of  expectations  of  behavior,  acknowl-
edging  the  visible  role  that  astronauts  play  in  representing  NASA.  A  senior  astro-
naut  is  currently  leading  a  team  of  astronauts  to  develop  these  values  and  at-
tributes  that  astronauts  are  expected  to  exhibit.  Once  developed  they  will  be  com-
municated  to  all  astronauts  and  prominently  displayed  in  conference  rooms  and
other  key  locations,  as  well  as  discussed  during  new  astronaut  selection.  We  will
discuss  enforcement  approaches  after  reviewing  proposed  expected  principles  of  be-
havior developed by the astronaut team.
Q2. Col.  Bachmann’s  testimony  notes  that  ‘‘an  anonymous  survey  of  the  relevant
NASA  populations,  covered  by  this  report-medical  personnel,  astronauts,  and
training  personnel’’  is  the  most  important  first  step  NASA  needs  to  take.  Will
NASA’s anonymous survey include all the groups identified by Col. Bachmann?
If not, why not?

A2. The  survey  included  flight  surgeons  and  astronauts  only.  The  survey  tool  was
selected to appraise the issues raised by crew members and flight surgeons because
these  were  the  specific  groups  that  had  raised  issues  with  the  Review  Committee
and we felt it should remain focused on these groups.

NASA  leadership  has  other  mechanisms  in  place  to  ensure  that  flight  safety  and
mission  success  concerns  can  be  raised  and  discussed  without  retribution  by  any
personnel.  In  response  to  the  External  Committee  finding,  the  Johnson  Space  Cen-
ter  (JSC)  took  the  opportunity  to  remind  affected  staff  of  the  importance  of  their
responsibility to raise concerns, and the mechanisms available to them for doing so,
including anonymous reporting systems such as the NASA Safety Reporting System
(NSRS).

Training  requirements  and  all  aspects  of  preparation  for  aeronautical  flight  and
space  flight  will  continue  to  be  rigorous  and  focused.  Crew  members  are  routinely
evaluated  on  their  performance  by  training  personnel  and  we  will  continue  to  en-
courage open and honest assessments.
Q3. NASA  has  announced  that  it  is  accepting  applications  for  the  2009  astronaut
class. With the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010, the astronaut class of 2009 will
be conducting longer-duration missions, making behavioral health an even more
important factor for astronaut crews. Could you please describe in specific terms
in what ways, if at all, the selection process is being modified in response to the
independent health care system review?

A3. Both the External Committee and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Internal Re-
view  recommended  that  NASA  evaluate  enhanced  usage  of  suitability  testing  for
‘‘select  in’’  purposes  for  acceptance  into  the  Astronaut  Corp.  This  testing  will  ulti-
mately need to be validated against actual space flight performance. JSC will review
the  state-of-the-art  for  suitability  testing  and  determine  if  any  changes  need  to  be
made to the current astronaut selection process. This will include consultation with
NASA aerospace psychologists/psychiatrists, external academic and industry-leading
industrial  and  organizational  psychologists.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  review,  it
may  be  appropriate  to  develop  a  suitability  standard  for  qualification  of  astronaut
applicants at selection.
Q4. You  testified  that  an  ‘‘Astronaut  Evaluation  Board  is  periodically  convened  by
the Astronaut Office to review astronauts completing flight assignments, astro-
naut candidate training, or other astronauts recommended for review.’’ Who are
the members of the Board, when did it last meet, and what issues did it address
in that meeting?

A4. The  Deputy  Chief  of  the  Astronaut  Office  usually  serves  as  the  Chairperson  of
the  Astronaut  Evaluation  Board  (AEB).  Board  members  are  senior  astronauts,  nor-
mally the Astronaut Office Branch Chiefs, whose leadership, experience, knowledge,
and  skills  are  applicable  to  the  subject  of  concern  and  whose  current  job  assign-
ments make them available to serve on the board. Input is also gathered from train-
ing personnel in addition to other astronauts.

The  last  AEB  was  conducted  on  August  29,  2007.  The  purpose  was  to  review  the
Space Shuttle and International Space Station expedition crew members recently re-
turning from flight to determine if they were eligible for another flight crew assign-
ment.
Q5. Your testimony notes that ‘‘NASA currently employs a system for reporting any
situation  requiring  attention  that  may  impact  safety  of  flight. . ..’’  Have  those
pathways,  including  the  Independent  Health  and  Medical  Technical  Authority,
been used to report issues regarding astronauts that may have affected safety of
flight? If so, could you please elaborate?

A5. No  issues  with  astronaut  behavior  that  may  impact  safety  of  flight  have  ever
been reported using these avenues.
Q6. Your  testimony  notes  that  you  have  ‘‘taken  the  opportunity  to  clarify  our  space
flight  alcohol  policy,  and  based  on  Bryan  O’Connor’s  review,  will  determine
whether  any  revision  or  expansion  of  the  policy  is  warranted.’’  What  plans,  if
any,  does  NASA  have  to  consult  the  Space  Life  Sciences  Directorate  regarding
the medical basis for the policy or any final changes to the alcohol policy?

A6. The Flight Crew Operations Directorate will continue to consult the Space Life
Sciences  Directorate  regarding  all  medical  aspects  of  this  and  other  policies.  Bi-
weekly meetings between space medicine and astronaut office management are tak-
ing place and will continue. NASA is in the midst of conducting an anonymous sur-
vey of astronauts and flight surgeons to provide additional feedback and gather sug-
gestions for improvement in this and other areas as well.

Questions submitted by Representative Jo Bonner
Q1. If  astronauts  have  been  conditioned  to  view  emotional  problems  as  weaknesses
to  be  suppressed  and  compartmentalized,  of  if  they  perceive  that  disclosing  per-
sonal problems could derail their careers, they will understandably be reluctant
to  seek  psychological  counseling.  How  do  you  foster  a  supportive,  trusting  rela-
tionship between the astronauts and the behavioral health specialists?

A1. No  data  exists  to  suggest  that  astronauts  are  conditioned  to  view  emotional
problems  as  weaknesses  to  be  suppressed.  In  fact,  the  behavioral  medicine  patient
numbers  provided  to  your  committee  covering  the  past  several  years  highlights  the
availability of these specialists and the extensive use of them by our astronauts and
their families.

Several approaches are used to foster a supportive, trusting relationship between
the  astronauts  and  the  behavioral  health  specialists.  First  and  foremost,  our  ap-
proach relies on respecting medical privacy policies and procedures. In addition, bi-
weekly meetings between space medicine and astronaut office management continue
to take place to help ensure regular and effective communications. NASA is also in
the midst of conducting an anonymous survey of our astronauts and flight surgeons
to  provide  additional  feedback,  and  suggestions  for  improvement,  in  a  variety  of
areas including level and quality of communications and trust.
Q2. The  Committee’s  Report  states  that  NASA  has  to  grapple  with  many  cultural
and  structural  issues,  some  of  which  have  existed  since  the  earliest  days  of  the
astronaut  program.  Do  you  agree  with  this  assessment?  If  yes,  what  steps  will
you take to change such deeply ingrained behaviors?

A2. In  performing  their  jobs  each  day,  astronauts  provide  input  into  all  aspects  of
operations  and  development  activities  including  readiness  for  flight,  both  within
their chain of command, and throughout human space flight program forums. It has
not been my experience that astronauts are reluctant to speak up, nor is there any
evidence  to  support  that  there  is  a  culture  that  inhibits  communication.  Nonethe-
less,  Flight  Crew  Operations  leadership  is  committed  to  following  up  on  the  com-
ments  in  the  report,  and  a  major  objective  of  the  survey  currently  underway  is  to
understand  any  potential  concerns  in  raising  or  responding  to  issues  with  flight
safety  or  crew  suitability  for  flight  or  any  barriers  that  might  exist  to  raising  con-
cerns.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Bryan  D.  O’Connor,  Chief,  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance,  National

Aeronautics and Space Administration

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your testimony notes that ‘‘Some or all of the reported incidences could possibly
have  happened  during  earlier  times  in  the  countdown  where  there  are  fewer
witnesses  and,  if  so,  they  would  represent  ground  safety  and  flight  schedule
threats.’’  If  such  incidences  were  occurring  at  earlier  times  in  the  countdown,
what  are  the  implications  for  ground  safety?  What  measures  are  in  place  to  de-
tect such threats to ground safety and flight schedule?

A1. This statement is meant to distinguish a flight safety issue (flying an impaired
crew member) from a ground safety issue (impaired crew member hurts himself the
day  before  launch  requiring  first  aid  or  other  medical  help),  and  a  schedule  issue
(crew  member  injures  himself  so  seriously  as  to  cause  the  flight  surgeon  to  with-
draw his certification for flight). In the Soyuz operation, a crew injury would result
in  the  backup  crew  member  being  assigned  to  fly,  and  there  would  be  no  affect  on
schedule.  For  the  Shuttle  operation,  where  there  are  no  backups,  a  grounded  crew
member would necessarily cause a launch slip. NASA would then have to wait until
the crew member has recovered from the injury, or train a substitute crew member.
Flight surgeons live in crew quarters with the crew members in the United States
and  Russia.  They  are  available  for  addressing  any  health-related  issue  that  might
constitute a concern to ground or flight safety. Further, examinations are conducted
ten days and two days before launch, and the flight surgeons are present on launch
morning including crew suit up.

In  addition,  the  Johnson  Space  Center  has  a  policy  which  requires  that  assigned
crew members abstain from high risk activities when they are assigned to missions.
Examples  in  the  policy  are  skydiving,  volunteer  firefighting,  air  racing,  and  (newly
added since the study) excessive use of alcohol.
Q2. Your testimony notes that ‘‘some whom I interviewed admitted that it is possible
that  someone  could  have  inadvertently  violated  the  12-hour  rule  by  a  small
amount  at  some  time  in  their  military  or  NASA  flying  career.’’  Was  this  point
included in your Safety Review? If not, why not? Could you please describe how
someone  could  have  inadvertently  violated  the  12-hour  rule?  Would  that  mean
that someone was unaware of the 12-hour policy?

A2. I  did  not  record  these  verbal  references  (from  long  retired  pilots)  in  my  report
because  they  were  not  about  space  flight.  One  reference  was  offered  as  a  hypo-
thetical: an airplane pilot could violate the rule concerning the 12-hour period before
launch,  during  which  astronauts  are  required  to  abstain  from  consuming  alcohol,
not  because  he  was  unaware  of  the  rule,  but  because  he  lost  track  of  the  time  at
the  restaurant  or  officers  club  the  night  before  a  scheduled  morning  flight.  The
other  was  a  general  reference  to  military  flying  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  where  peo-
ple sometimes bumped up against the 12-hour rule due to sloppy time management,
and peer pressure. The purpose of both of these references was to compare the past
and  current  cultures.  The  message  I  took  from  these  non  specific  references  was
that alcohol and flying was a bigger issue 30–40 years ago than it is today, and that
today’s  airplane  pilots,  including  those  assigned  to  NASA,  are  much  better  about
separating alcohol from flying than their predecessors were in the ‘‘old days.’’
Q3. How often are the appeals processes and the Health and Medical Technical Au-

thority being used and for what types of issues?

A3. The  Health  and  Medical  Technical  Authority  reviews  all  health  and  medical
waivers  and  exceptions  for  all  three  programs,  the  Space  Shuttle,  International
Space Station (ISS) and Constellation. Programmatic issues have been addressed to
date  at  the  local  Johnson  Space  Center  (JSC)  level  without  needing  to  elevate  an
appeal  or  waiver  decision  to  the  Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer.  All  individual
medical waiver issues for astronauts are reviewed by the Chief Health and Medical
Officer,  and  permanent  waivers  for  medical  conditions  are  also  approved  by  the
Chief  Health  and  Medical  Officer.  Medical  disqualification  of  individuals  is  ex-
tremely  rare,  and  over  the  last  10  years  the  appeals  process  for  individual  medical
disqualification  has  only  been  used  twice.  Active  communication  takes  place  be-
tween  the  JSC  Chief  Medical  Officer  and  the  Headquarters  Chief  Health  and  Med-
ical  Officer  weekly  for  programmatic  and  aerospace  medicine  issues  and  quarterly
summaries are provided as well. In 2003, a minority opinion was developed for ISS

flight readiness concerning the availability of exercise equipment and environmental
monitoring;  this  was  presented  at  the  Flight  Readiness  Review  and  all  aspects  of
the  issue  were  considered  by  senior  management.  All  participants  were  very  satis-
fied  with  the  discussion  and  communication.  This  outcome  is  discussed  within  the
Health and Medical Technical Authority as an example of effectively raising and ad-
dressing flight safety issues to senior management.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. How  should  NASA  deal  with  an  astronaut’s  natural  reluctance  to  raise  health
or  behavioral  issues  that  they  believe  may  jeopardize  their  selection  for  future
missions  or  assignments?  Based  on  your  experience,  are  members  of  the  Astro-
naut  Corps  confident  that  they  can  raise  health  issues,  or  emotional  or  family
problems without fear of jeopardizing their NASA careers?

A1. The behavioral medicine patient numbers provided previously to the Committee
covering the past several years highlight the availability of these specialists and the
extensive use of them by our astronauts and their families.

In  order  to  continue  to  encourage  astronauts  to  raise  and  address  behavioral
health issues, several approaches are being pursued to foster a supportive and trust-
ing  relationship  between  the  astronauts  and  the  behavioral  health  specialists  as
outlined below:

1) The  behavioral  health  clinic  is  separate  from  the  flight  medicine  clinic  to

maintain privacy.

2) Privacy  Act  requirements  are  followed  to  ensure  the  privacy  of  behavioral

health visits.

3) The  behavioral  health  clinic  is  available  for  the  astronaut  dependents  as
well.  Thus,  the  whole  family  can  get  the  appropriate  psychological  support.
4) New  processes  are  being  developed  to  include  an  annual  behavioral  health
exam  for  astronauts  that  should  make  behavioral  health  encounters  routine
and  foster  more  communication  between  care  providers  and  the  astronauts.
5) NASA  is  conducting  an  anonymous  survey  of  our  astronauts  and  flight  sur-
geons  to  provide  additional  feedback,  and  suggestions  for  improvement,  in  a
variety of areas including level and quality of communications and trust.

Q2. In the aftermath of the Challenger and Columbia accidents NASA has tried very
hard  to  ensure  that  there  are  open,  independent  communication  paths  to  raise
safety  concerns.  Would  you  please  discuss  policies  and/or  procedures  that  are
now  in  place  to  ensure  employees  are  encouraged  to  report  any  safety  of  flight
issues, and would you please discuss how, if at all, you are changing or revising
those  policies  as  a  result  of  the  NASA  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review
Committee report?

A2. NASA  has  many  paths  for  communication  and  these  paths  are  described  in
NASA  policy  and  NASA  Procedural  Requirements  (NPR)  such  as  NPR  8715.1  re-
garding NASA Occupational Safety and Health Programs. These include:

1) reporting  to  Center  or  Component  Facility  Safety/Health  Official(s),  as  ap-

propriate;

2) reporting to supervisory personnel or management;
3) reporting to Center Director;
4) reporting through the Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) organizations;
5) reporting  through  the  Designated  Agency  Safety  and  Health  Official

(DASHO);

6) anonymously reporting through the NASA Safety Reporting System (NSRS);
7) anonymously  reporting  through  Center  hotlines  such  as  the  Johnson  Space

Center (JSC) Hotline;

8) reporting to the Inspector Genera; and,
9) reporting directly to the Administrator.

NASA  also  recognizes  that  employees  have  external  reporting  options  including
the Office of Federal Agency Safety and Health Programs—Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA)/Department of Labor.

Following  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  (CAIB)  recommendations,
NASA  instituted  three  technical  authorities,  one  for  each  of  the  following  dis-
ciplines:  engineering,  safety,  and  health  and  medical.  Employees  may  bring  their

concerns  to  the  technical  authority.  If  they  are  not  satisfied  with  the  way  in  which
their  concerns  are  dispositioned,  there  is  a  reclama  process  by  which  all  decisions
are elevated to the highest levels of NASA management.

Since  the  NASA  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  report,  the
flight  surgeons  and  astronauts  also  received  refresher  briefings  of  these  available
pathways,  and  their  use  is  encouraged  and  supported.  The  Administrator  and  the
Director,  Johnson  Space  Center,  reemphasized  their  encouragement  that  any  em-
ployee can communicate with them directly for issues of concern.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Michael D. Griffin, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Ad-

ministration

Question submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Col. Bachmann’s testimony noted that ‘‘organizations as diverse as the military,
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  Veterans  Administration
(VA)  have  made  great  progress,  with  active  supervisory  and  peer  involvement,
in  changing  cultural  attitudes  towards  safety,  accountability,  empowerment,
and alcohol.’’ What plans, if any, does NASA have for exploring and considering
other federal agency approaches to these types of issues?

A1. NASA is actively benchmarking against many organizations to improve organi-
zational  effectiveness.  Benchmarking  for  specific  issues  such  as  those  raised  in  the
report  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  Veterans  Administration,  and  the
Department of Defense will be added to this process that is already underway.

NASA has initiated an activity to explore other federal agencies’ and non-govern-
ment  organizations’  approaches  to  analyzing  cultural  attitudes  towards  safety,  ac-
countability  and  empowerment  and  employ  techniques  to  improve  safety  climate
across the Agency.

Recognizing the importance of safety culture, over the past two years NASA’s Of-
fice  of  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance  (OSMA),  has  developed  and  maintained  con-
tacts with several faculty members of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and the
University  of  California  at  Berkeley  (UCB)  who  have  developed  a  web-based  safety
climate  survey  tool  for  the  Naval  Aviation  School.  Recognizing  the  difficulty  inher-
ent in measuring safety culture, this tool uses safety climate metrics as an indicator
of  cultural  strengths  and  weaknesses.  After  several  exchanges  of  information  and
views  between  the  OSMA  and  the  NPS/UCB  faculty,  it  was  decided  that  a  proof-
of-concept  should  be  undertaken  to  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  using  a  similar
tool  at  NASA.  The  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC)  volunteered  to  participate
in  the  first  pilot  study  just  completed.  On  August  24,  2007,  the  preliminary  results
of this pilot project were presented to OSMA. OSMA is currently evaluating the re-
sults  of  this  study  and  is  planning  to  conduct  a  series  of  additional  pilot  studies.
These  studies  will  allow  OSMA  to  incrementally  arrive  at  an  Agency-wide  safety
culture shaping and measurement process that will be effective for both design and
operational  environments  at  NASA.  OSMA  is  also  investigating  whether  this  proc-
ess  will  allow  NASA  on-site  contractors  to  participate  on  a  voluntary  basis;  con-
tractor participation may be dependent on the specific contract. To this end, the ac-
tivities outlined below are being pursued by OSMA.

• Examine  the  results  of  the  GSFC  study  and  past  safety  culture  assessment
and  shaping  processes  performed  at  NASA  as  well  as  in  other  government
and  non-government  organizations  to  determine  best  practices  and  analyze
what practices could be adapted for NASA use.
• Develop  a  safety  culture  assessment  and  shaping  process,  or  adapt/refine  a
currently  employed  process  for  NASA  use  that  incorporates  the  applicable
government and industry best practices. This process will include methods to
educate Center leadership on the process, measure safety climate, analyze the
survey data, and advise NASA Headquarters and Center leadership as to the
results and recommended strategies to strengthen safety culture.

NASA  is  pursuing  a  multi-faceted  approach  for  improving  safety  climate  across

the Agency. This approach is based on:

• integration  of  safety  management  with  programmatic  and  engineering  deci-
• achieving technical excellence in safety and mission assurance activities.

sion processes; and

The  former  is  being  implemented  through  NASA’s  governance  model.  The  latter
is being addressed by establishing the NASA Safety Center to expand and strength-
en the safety training element of NASA’s safety program.

this assessment? If yes, what steps will you take to change such deeply ingrained
behaviors?

A1. NASA  has  made  many  cultural  and  structural  changes  based  on  the  Columbia
Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) report recommendations. To determine if there
are  other  specific  cultural  or  structural  issues  that  need  to  be  changed,  NASA  is
first  pursuing  an  anonymous  survey  to  further  characterize  issues  related  to  cul-
tural  and  structural  issues  within  the  Astronaut  Corps  and  within  the  cadre  of
flight surgeons. The survey is focused on communication, trust and decision-making.
Results of this survey will be utilized to guide any needed changes to address issues
of concern with the astronaut and medical communities.

From  an  Agency  perspective,  it  is  widely  recognized  that  improvement  in  safety
culture  can  be  derived  from  improvements  in  the  safety  climate  through  active  su-
pervisory and peer involvement. The safety climate of an organization is defined by
many  factors  including  technical  knowledge  and  behavior  of  its  members  with  re-
gard  to  safety.  This  includes  opportunities  for  personnel  exposure  to  safety  prin-
ciples and practices, dissemination of safety lessons learned, the ease of safety com-
munication  up  and  down  the  organization,  and  the  consideration  of  safety  in  man-
agement decisions.

NASA  is  pursuing  a  multi-faceted  approach  for  improving  safety  climate  across

the Agency that will include the Astronaut Corps. This approach is based on:

• Integration  of  safety  management  with  programmatic  and  engineering  deci-

sion processes.

• Achieving technical excellence in safety and mission assurance activities.

The  former  is  being  implemented  through  NASA’s  governance  model.  The  latter
is  being  addressed  by  establishing  the  NASA  Safety  Center  (NSC)  to  expand  and
strengthen the safety training element of NASA’s safety program. Each approach is
briefly discussed below:
NASA  Governance  Model—Over  the  past  several  years,  NASA  has  been  defining
and implementing an overall governance model that is based on: (1) responsible de-
cision-making; (2) a balance of power; and, (3) the establishment of checks and bal-
ances. These elements and the practices are a direct outgrowth of the CAIB findings
and establish a framework for a safety culture to grow and thrive. These three ele-
ments  permit  ongoing  lively  discussion  and  debate  to  occur  unfettered  at  all  levels
within  the  NASA  organization.  The  NASA  Administrator  has  set  the  overall  tone
for  these  discussions  and  debates  by  consistently  challenging  decisions  and  estab-
lished  policies  looking  for  new  ways  to  answer  questions,  and  NASA  has  codified  a
formal process for dissent in NASA Procedural Requirements 7120.SD, NASA Space
Flight Program and Project Management Requirements. The visibility and clear def-
inition of the overall decision process along with the examples of these processes set
at  the  highest  level  of  the  Agency  in  the  Program  Management  Council  and  other
top  level  councils  establishes  the  benchmark  for  the  rest  of  the  Agency  to  follow.
Even so, NASA recognizes that even with these concepts documented and regularly
exercised,  there  will  be  people  that  remain  uncomfortable  even  in  the  most  open  of
organizational  safety  climates.  Some  of  that  lack  of  comfort  might  be  attributed  to
a  lack  of  technical  competency  or  standing  among  one’s  peers  or  from  lack  of  con-
fidence  in  the  openness  of  management.  As  discussed  in  the  following  paragraphs
NASA is taking steps to increase the competence (and confidence in the competence)
of the NASA workforce relating to safety and mission assurance disciplines through
the  Technical  Excellence  activities,  and  we  are  also  developing  the  capability  to
measure the overall climate with respect to safety.
Achieving  Technical  Excellence  in  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance—NASA  is  com-
mitted to increase the awareness and concern for safety at all levels beginning with
system  safety  in  design  and  facility  operations  to  astronauts  and  flight  operations.
Increased excellence and awareness in safety are necessary ingredients for strength-
ening  our  safety  culture.  The  Technical  Excellence  Program  being  developed  at  the
NSC will conduct educational programs to raise safety awareness, disseminate safe-
ty  lessons  learned,  and  increase  the  safety  emphasis  of  NASA  management  and
staff.  Safety  engineering  and  management  courses  that  are  being  planned  will  ad-
dress not only safety in the operational and design environment but also philosophy
and  doctrine  that  influence  the  various  management  and  technical  levels  at  NASA.
We believe that the envisioned Technical Excellence Program will not only increase
the safety competency of our workforce but will also increase management’s aware-
ness of the benefits that derive from sound safety management and safety engineer-
ing principles and processes being applied uniformly across the Agency.

Measuring  and  Communicating  Safety  Culture  Using  a  Standard  Process—Recog-
nizing the importance of safety culture, our Office of Safety and Mission Assurance
(OSMA),  over  the  past  two  years,  has  developed  and  maintained  contacts  with  sev-
eral  faculty  members  of  the  Naval  Postgraduate  School  (NPS)  and  the  University
of California at Berkeley (UCB) who have developed a web-based safety climate sur-
vey  tool  for  the  Naval  Aviation  School.  Recognizing  the  difficulty  inherent  in  meas-
uring safety culture, this tool uses safety climate metrics as an indicator of cultural
strengths  and  weaknesses.  After  several  exchanges  of  information  and  views  be-
tween  the  OSMA  and  the  NPS/UCB  faculty,  it  was  decided  that  a  proof-of-concept
should be undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of using a similar tool at NASA.
The  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC)  volunteered  to  participate  in  the  first
pilot study just completed. On August 24, 2007, the preliminary results of this pilot
project  were  presented  to  OSMA.  OSMA  is  currently  evaluating  the  results  of  this
study  and  is  planning  to  conduct  a  series  of  additional  pilot  studies.  These  studies
will  allow  OSMA  to  incrementally  arrive  at  an  Agency-wide  safety  culture  shaping
and measurement process that will be effective for both design and operational envi-
ronments  at  NASA.  OSMA  is  also  investigating  whether  this  process  will  allow
NASA  on-site  contractors  to  participate  on  a  voluntary  basis;  contractor  participa-
tion may be dependent on the specific contract. To this end, the following activities
are being pursued by OSMA:

• Examine  the  results  of  the  GSFC  study  and  past  safety  culture  assessment
and  shaping  processes  performed  at  NASA  as  well  as  in  other  government
and  non-government  organizations  to  determine  best  practices  and  analyze
what practices could be adapted for NASA use.
• Develop  a  safety  culture  assessment  and  shaping  process,  or  adapt/refine  a
currently  employed  process  for  NASA  use  that  incorporates  the  applicable
government and industry best practices. This process will include methods to
educate Center leadership on the process, measure safety climate, analyze the
survey data, and advise NASA Headquarters and Center leadership as to the
results and recommended strategies to strengthen safety culture.

Together,  these  efforts  will  allow  NASA  to  address  many  cultural  and  structural
issues, some of which have existed since the earliest days of the astronaut program.
Q2. What  can  you  do  as  the  NASA  Administrator  to  verify  that  there  is  no  stigma
associated  with  an  astronaut  seeking  psychological  counseling,  particularly  for
common emotional, or family related issues?

A2. Several approaches are being pursued. The behavioral health clinic is physically
separate from the flight medicine clinic to maintain privacy. Privacy Act regulations
are assiduously followed to further maintain the privacy of behavioral health visits.
The  behavioral  health  clinic  is  available  for  both  astronauts  and  their  dependents
providing  the  whole  family  with  appropriate  psychological  support.  New  processes
are  being  developed  to  include  an  annual  behavioral  health  exam  for  astronauts
that should make behavioral health encounters routine and foster more communica-
tion between care providers and the astronauts.

The  NASA  aeromedical  certification  boards  would  only  consider  a  health  related
issue  if  it  represented  a  potential  flight  safety  issue;  even  in  this  circumstance,  all
efforts  are  made  for  any  medical  or  behavioral  health  issue,  to  restore  or  maintain
the astronaut’s health. Behavioral and medical issues are considered equally and no
stigma  is  attached  to  any  health  care  issue.  NASA  has  also  put  in  place  more  fre-
quent communication between the space medicine providers and Astronaut Office so
that  any  aeromedical  certification  issues  are  clearly  communicated  including  ex-
pected outcomes and resolution of the problem.
Q3. Has  the  Aerospace  Safety  Advisory  Panel  (ASAP)  been  involved  in  the  findings
of the report or made any recommendations to guide NASA with implementation
of the recommendations?

A3. The  Aerospace  Safety  Advisory  Panel  (ASAP)  is  working  with  NASA,  at  mul-
tiple  levels,  to  better  understand  the  issues  highlighted  and  the  recommendations
that  were  made.  The  ASAP  has  stated  that  their  most  important  contribution  will
be to provide the NASA Administrator with independent counsel regarding changes
implemented in response to the report. The Panel has indicated to NASA that they
believe the report highlights both process issues and communication challenges that
should be taken to heart and expeditiously addressed. The Panel has also indicated
to  NASA  that  they  trusts  the  Agency’s  ‘‘improving  culture  of  openness’’  will  enable
the Agency to also take aboard the subtle, yet important, messages contained in the
report.

It  should  be  noted  that  Dr.  James  Bagian,  who  served  on  the  Bachman  Panel,  is

also a member of the ASAP.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. NASA has focused an investigation on the incidents of alcohol mentioned in the
external  review.  Col.  Bachmann’s  testimony  notes  that  these  incidents  were  ex-
amples of bigger issues of ‘‘human factors concerns with significant safety impli-
cations  [that]  had  been  disregarded  when  raised  to  local  on-scene  leadership.’’
What are NASA’s plans for probing these larger human factors concerns and po-
tential safety implications?

A1. NASA  has  developed  a  comprehensive  response  plan  that  addresses  all  rec-
ommendations  in  the  NASA  Astronaut  Health  Care  System  Review  Committee  Re-
port.  Recommendations  for  addressing  human  factors  concerns  are  being  developed
by  both  the  medical  and  astronaut  groups  and  final  recommended  changes  will  be
presented to the Medical Policy Board (MPB) early next year. The MPB will oversee
the entire report implementation including the human factors issues noted.

NASA is probing these larger human factors concerns related to open communica-
tion  and  safety  climate  by  pursuing  a  multi-faceted  approach  for  improving  safety
climate across the Agency. This approach is based on:

• Integration  of  safety  management  with  programmatic  and  engineering  deci-
• Achieving technical excellence in safety and mission assurance activities.

sion processes.

The  former  is  being  implemented  through  NASA’s  governance  model.  The  latter
is  being  addressed  by  establishing  the  NASA  Safety  Center  (NSC)  to  expand  and
strengthen the safety training element of NASA’s safety program. Each approach is
briefly discussed below:
NASA Governance Model—Over the past several years NASA has been defining and
implementing an overall governance model that is based on: (1) responsible decision-
making;  (2)  a  balance  of  power;  and,  (3)  the  establishment  of  checks  and  balances.
These  elements  and  the  practices  are  a  direct  outgrowth  of  the  Columbia  Accident
Investigation Board findings and establish a framework for a safety culture to grow
and  thrive.  These  three  elements  permit  ongoing  lively  discussion  and  debate  to
occur  unfettered  at  all  levels  within  the  NASA  organization.  The  NASA  Adminis-
trator  has  set  the  overall  tone  for  these  discussions  and  debates  by  consistently
challenging decisions and established policies looking for new ways to answer ques-
tions,  and  NASA  has  codified  a  formal  process  for  dissent  in  NASA  Procedural  Re-
quirements  7120.513,  NASA  Space  Flight  Program  and  Project  Management  Re-
quirements.  The  visibility  and  clear  definition  of  the  overall  decision  process  along
with  the  examples  of  these  processes  set  at  the  highest  level  of  the  Agency  in  the
Program  Management  Council  and  other  top  level  councils  establishes  the  bench-
mark  for  the  rest  of  the  Agency  to  follow.  NASA  recognizes  that,  even  with  these
concepts  documented  and  regularly  exercised,  there  will  be  people  that  remain  un-
comfortable  even  in  the  most  open  of  organizational  safety  climates.  Some  of  that
lack  of  comfort  might  be  attributed  to  a  lack  of  technical  competency  or  standing
among  one’s  peers  or  from  lack  of  confidence  in  the  openness  of  management.  As
discussed  in  the  following  paragraphs,  NASA  is  taking  steps  to  increase  the  com-
petence (and confidence in the competence) of the NASA workforce relating to safety
and  mission  assurance  disciplines  through  the  Technical  Excellence  activities,  and
we  are  also  developing  the  capability  to  measure  the  overall  climate  with  respect
to safety.
Achieving  Technical  Excellence  in  Safety  and  Mission  Assurance  Activities—NASA
is  committed  to  increase  the  awareness  and  concern  for  safety  at  all  levels,  begin-
ning  with  system  safety  in  design  and  facility  operations  to  astronauts  and  flight
operations.  Increased  excellence  and  awareness  in  safety  are  necessary  ingredients
for strengthening our safety culture. The Technical Excellence Program being devel-
oped  at  the  NSC  will  conduct  educational  programs  to  raise  safety  awareness,  dis-
seminate safety lessons learned, and increase the safety emphasis of NASA manage-
ment and staff. Safety engineering and management courses that are being planned
will address not only safety in the operational and design environment, but also phi-
losophy and doctrine that influence the various management and technical levels at
NASA.  We  believe  that  the  envisioned  Technical  Excellence  Program  will  not  only
increase the safety competency of our workforce but will also increase management’s
awareness of the benefits that derive from sound safety management and safety en-
gineering principles and processes being applied uniformly across the Agency.

Measuring  and  Communicating  Safety  Culture  Using  a  Standard  Process—Recog-
nizing the importance of safety culture, our Office of Safety and Mission Assurance
(OSMA),  over  the  past  two  years,  has  developed  and  maintained  contacts  with  sev-
eral  faculty  members  of  the  Naval  Postgraduate  School  (NPS)  and  the  University
of California at Berkeley (UCB) who have developed a web-based safety climate sur-
vey  tool  for  the  Naval  Aviation  School.  Recognizing  the  difficulty  inherent  in  meas-
uring safety culture, this tool uses safety climate metrics as an indicator of cultural
strengths  and  weaknesses.  After  several  exchanges  of  information  and  views  be-
tween  the  OSMA  and  the  NPS/UCB  faculty,  it  was  decided  that  a  proof-of-concept
should be undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of using a similar tool at NASA.
The  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC)  volunteered  to  participate  in  the  first
pilot study just completed. On August 24, 2007, the preliminary results of this pilot
project  were  presented  to  OSMA.  OSMA  is  currently  evaluating  the  results  of  this
study  and  is  planning  to  conduct  a  series  of  additional  pilot  studies.  These  studies
will  allow  OSMA  to  incrementally  arrive  at  an  Agency-wide  safety  culture  shaping
and measurement process that will be effective for both design and operational envi-
ronments  at  NASA.  OSMA  is  also  investigating  whether  this  process  will  allow
NASA  on-site  contractors  to  participate  on  a  voluntary  basis;  contractor  participa-
tion may be dependent on the specific contract. To this end, the following activities
are being pursued by OSMA:

• Examine  the  results  of  the  GSFC  study  and  past  safety  culture  assessment
and  shaping  processes  performed  at  NASA  as  well  as  in  other  government
and  non-government  organizations  to  determine  best  practices  and  analyze
what practices could be adapted for NASA use.
• Develop  a  safety  culture.  assessment  and  shaping  process,  or  adapt/refine  a
currently  employed  process  for  NASA  use  that  incorporates  the  applicable
government and industry best practices. This process will include methods to
educate Center leadership on the process, measure safety climate, analyze the
survey data, and advise NASA Headquarters and Center leadership as to the
results and recommended strategies to strengthen safety culture.

Q2. Deputy  Administrator  Dale  noted  during  the  press  conference  on  the  external
health  care  review  report  that  NASA  has  ‘‘explicitly  extended’’  the  T–38  policy
on alcohol use to space flight.
a. Ms.  Dale  referred  to  it  as  an  ‘‘interim  policy.’’  Could  you  please  discuss  how

and when NASA will establish a final policy?

b. Has  the  T–38  policy  that  currently  applies  to  space  flight  been  considered  by
NASA medical officials as to the medical basis of the policy? If not, will med-
ical officials be consulted?

c. The  Space  Flight  Safety  Review  identifies  and  makes  recommendations  to
strengthen  policies  related  to  alcohol  use  and  abuse.  What  are  NASA’s  plans
for making actual changes to those policies?

A2a,c. Ms.  Dale  stated  that  NASA  ‘‘explicitly  extended’’  the  T–38  policy  on  alcohol
to include all spacecraft. Due to the urgent nature of the policy clarification, NASA
quickly  issued  this  policy  via  an  interim  policy  memorandum  to  all  astronauts
signed by the Director, Flight Operations Crew on July 27, 2007. (At NASA, interim
policy is issued when there is an urgent requirement that must be quickly conveyed,
and  interim  policy  expires  12  months  from  the  date  of  issuance.  This  allows  policy
developers one year to integrate the new policy into a formal policy directive or pro-
cedural requirement.) Prior to the expiration of this interim policy, NASA will refine
its policies related to alcohol use across the Agency civil service and contractor work
force  and  will  codify  the  revised  policies  and  procedures  in  permanent  NASA  direc-
tives.

The original policy, the Johnson Space Center document Aircraft Operations Divi-
sion  (AOD)  09295:  Aircraft  Operations  and  Training  Procedures:  T–38  Operating
Procedures  Volume  1  documented  the  general  practices  that  apply  to  the  entire
Flight  Crew  Operations  Directorate  (all  astronauts),  but  was  titled  Training  Proce-
dures  for  the  T–38.  To  prevent  any  confusion,  on  July  27,  2007,  an  interim  policy
memorandum  was  generated  to  extend  the  12-hour  bottle-to-throttle  policy  to  the
Space  Shuttle.  In  addition,  other  efforts  are  underway  to  extend  NASA’s  policy  on
alcohol  use.  NASA  has  formed  an  Agency-level  team  to  clarify  procedures  and  re-
quirements  for  drug  and  alcohol  testing  of  civil  servants,  contractors,  and  sub-
contractors. This team is also working to ensure supervisory and employee training
addresses the policy, procedures, and requirements. The team is evaluating the best
method  to  evaluate  compliance  with  contract.  This  effort  will  include  a  process  to
review the status of contractor drug and alcohol-free workplace plans and their asso-

ciated  metrics  to  establish  whether  a  contractor  is  compliant  with  existing  NASA
requirements.  The  policy,  procedure,  and  training  changes  will  be  Agency-wide,  en-
sure  that  NASA  is  compliant  with  all  applicable  laws,  and  strengthen  our  efforts
to  ensure  alcohol  use  and  abuse  does  not  affect  the  safety  of  our  missions.  Any
changes related to alcohol use are governed by laws; therefore NASA’s new policies
and requirements must be created and then circulated through Health and Human
Services  and  the  Department  of  Justice.  NASA  anticipates  this  entire  process  will
not take more than 18–24 months until completion.
A2b. The  T–38  policy  had  previously  been  accepted  by  NASA  medical  officials  and
will be reviewed by the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer’s Medical Pol-
icy Board advisory group.
