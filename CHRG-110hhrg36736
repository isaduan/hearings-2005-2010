SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Tracking the Storm at the
National Hurricane Center

THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

The  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment  and  the  Subcommittee  on  Inves-
tigations and Oversight will meet on July 19, 2007, to evaluate recent events at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Tropical Prediction Cen-
ter (TPC/NHC).

Upon  the  orders  of  NOAA’s  Administrator,  Conrad  Lautenbacher,  an  assessment
team  was  formed  to  review  the  operations  of  the  tropical  prediction  center.  In  re-
sponse to the Assessment Team’s preliminary reports, the Vice Admiral placed Cen-
ter Director X. William (Bill) Proenza on administrative leave. NOAA Administrator
Lautenbacher stated that ‘‘. . .current conditions at the TPC pose an obstacle to the
Team’s  completion  of  its  work,  as  well  as  the  Team’s  concern  that,  as  expressed  by
many of you, there currently exists a level of anxiety and disruption that threatens
the  TPC’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  mission  to  protect  the  American  people. . ..’’  This
hearing will explore the process that culminated in Mr. Proenza’s removal.
Witnesses
Panel I

1. Mr.  X.  William  Proenza,  Director,  Tropical  Prediction  Center,  National
Hurricane  Center,  National  Centers  for  Environmental  Prediction,  National
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  has  been  invited  to  discuss  his
service as Director of the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Cen-
ter and his experiences during the recent events that led the NOAA Admin-
istrator to place him on leave.

Panel II

2. Dr.  Robert  Atlas,  Director  of  the  Atlantic  Oceanographic  and  Meteorolog-
ical  Laboratory,  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration.  Dr.  At-
las’s laboratory is part of the Hurricane Research Division, which works with
the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  to  improve  tools  and  techniques  in  hurricane
forecasting. He has been asked to focus on the use of QuikSCAT data in the
forecasting process.

3. Mr. Don McKinnon, Director, Jones County (MS) Emergency Management
Agency,  will  testify  regarding  services  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)
provides  to  emergency  management  offices.  Mr.  McKinnon  dealt  extensively
with  Mr.  Proenza  during  his  service  as  Director  of  the  Weather  Service
Southern Region Office.

4. Mr. Robie Robinson, Director, Dallas County Office of Security and Emer-
gency  Management,  is  testifying  on  behalf  of  the  Emergency  Management
Association  of  Texas  regarding  the  service  provided  to  the  emergency  man-
agement  community  in  Texas  by  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)
through  the  Southern  Region  Office  during  the  period  of  Mr.  Proenza’s  ten-
ure as its Director.

5. Hon.  Conrad  Lautenbacher,  Vice  Admiral,  U.S.  Navy  (Ret.),  Undersecre-
tary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  and  Administrator,  National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has been asked to describe how he
decided  to  dispatch  an  assessment  team  to  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center
and, as a result of a preliminary report from that team, to place Mr. Proenza
on  leave.  The  team  was  directed  to  submit  a  report  on  the  situation  at  the
Center on Friday, July 20, 2007.

6. Dr. James Turner, Deputy Director of National Institute of Standards and
Technology  (NIST),  led  the  Assessment  Team  at  the  request  of  Admiral
Lautenbacher and will testify on the assessment and the findings of the As-
sessment Team’s report.

Background

The  National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  is  publicly  known  as  the  unit  of  the  Na-
tional  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  responsible  for  tracking  and  fore-
casting  of  tropical  storms  and  hurricanes.  Organizationally,  the  Center  is  a  branch
of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  (TPC)  of  the  National  Center  for  Environmental
Prediction  (NCEP)  and  Mr.  Proenza’s  actual  title  is  Director  of  the  Tropical  Pre-
diction  Center.  The  Center  assists  emergency  management  agencies  in  the  coastal
states  by  providing  information  on  the  development  of  storms,  their  likely  track
across  the  ocean  and  their  probable  point  of  landfall  on  the  U.S.  coast.  With  this
information,  State  and  local  officials  make  decisions  about  whether  to  evacuate
threatened areas.

Mr.  Proenza  became  Director  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  in  January  2007,
succeeding Max Mayfield. In his previous post as Director of the NWS Southern Re-
gional Office, he managed some 1,000 employees from New Mexico to the Virgin Is-
lands  between  1998  and  2006.  An  employee  of  the  Service  for  35  years,  he  began
at  the  National  Hurricane  Center  as  a  flight  meteorologist  aboard  the  ‘‘hurricane
hunter’’ aircraft that support Center operations. Among his awards during his serv-
ice was recognition as Manager of the Year from the National Weather Service Em-
ployees’ Organization.

On March 16, Mr. Proenza gave an interview to the Associated Press. That article
described  him  seeking  ‘‘hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  for  expanded  research  and
predictions.’’  It  then  described  his  ‘‘immediate  concern’’  to  be  the  QuikSCAT  sat-
ellite,  specifically  the  age  of  the  satellite,  the  lack  of  any  replacement  if  it  failed,
and  the  potential  cost  and  time  needed  to  for  replacement.  He  stated  that
QuikSCAT’s  failure  would  reduce  the  accuracy  of  their  two-day  predictions  by  10
percent and 16 percent for three-day forecasts.

In  a  telephone  interview  with  Committee  staff,  Mr.  Proenza  was  asked  how
QuikSCAT  had  come  to  his  attention.  He  responded  that  while  he  was  visiting  the
Center  to  discuss  transition  issues  in  December  2006,  he  had  been  approached  by
Senior  Hurricane  Specialist  Richard  Knabb  and  Michael  Brennan,  who  was  affili-
ated  with  both  the  Center  and  the  University  Corporation  for  Atmospheric  Re-
search. Both had participated in a June 2006 Center workshop on requirements for
ocean  surface  vector  winds  (which  QuikSCAT  measures).  Mr.  Proenza  told  staff  he
had  read  the  report,  and  noted  the  statements  there  by  both  Mr.  Knabb  and  Hugh
Cobb,  lead  forecaster  in  the  Center’s  Tropical  Forecast  and  Analysis  Branch  about
QuikSCAT’s  value.  Proenza  told  Committee  staff  that  he  had  discussed  the  work-
shop report with his managers in the Weather Service two days after assuming his
job.  Proenza  also  said  that,  while  on  the  way  to  the  AP  interview,  he  had  called
Center  Deputy  Director  (now  Acting  Director)  Dr.  Edward  Rappaport  and  received
the figures quoted in the interview.

In  his  presentation  at  the  National  Hurricane  Conference  in  April,  Mr.  Proenza
again  expressed  concern  over  QuikSCAT.  His  presentation  chart  called  for  ‘‘a  next-
generation QuikSCAT on an accelerated timetable (consistent with recommendation
by the NRC Decadal Survey). Estimated cost: $375–400 million.’’ He said that issues
like  this  demonstrated  that  more  funding  needed  to  be  devoted  to  improving  hurri-
cane  research  and  forecasting.  An  article  in  the  South  Florida  Sun-Sentinel  quoted
Senior  Specialist  Knabb  at  the  same  conference  saying  that  the  satellite  had
‘‘. . .helped  the  National  Hurricane  Center  [achieve]  record  accuracy  in  predicting
the path of 10 systems.’’

On June 11, NOAA’s Assistant Administrator for Program Planning and Integra-
tion,  Mary  Glackin,  became  acting  Director  of  the  National  Weather  Service  after
D.L.  Johnson’s  retirement.  On  June  14,  she  visited  with  Mr.  Proenza  at  his  office
in  Miami  and  delivered  a  memorandum  entitled  ‘‘Operating  Procedures/Instruc-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

5

tions.’’  The  memorandum  listed  cases  when  ‘‘you  [Mr.  Proenza]  may  have  dis-
regarded  the  direct  instructions  of  your  supervisor. . .  or  have  made  decisions  on
your  own  which  you  had  no  authority  to  make.’’  The  memorandum  also  discussed
Mr.  Proenza’s  interactions  with  the  news  media.  He  was  instructed  to  conform  to
the  procedures  in  the  new  Department  Order  on  ‘‘Public  Communications’’  (which
had  only  become  effective  in  May),  and  was  told  that  ‘‘your  recent  statements. . .
may  have  caused  some  unnecessary  confusion  about  NOAA’s  ability  to  accurately
predict  tropical  storms,’’  and  commented  about  ‘‘unnecessary  detrimental  effects  on
our  organization,  for  example:  requiring  me  to  spend  a  disproportionate  amount  of
time to correct any confusion; causing undue concern and misunderstanding among
your  staff,  and;  taking  valuable  time  away  from  your  public  role  as  the  NOAA  offi-
cial responsible for instilling confidence in our tropical storm predictions. . ..’’

Staffs  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee  and  the  Energy  and  Commerce
Committee met with Ms. Glackin and with Louis Uccellini, Director of the National
Centers  for  Environmental  Prediction  (and  Mr.  Proenza’s  immediate  supervisor)  on
July  12.  Ms.  Glackin  stated  that  the  memorandum  was  not  intended  as  a  rep-
rimand.  She  stated  it  was  prepared  after  she  talked  to  Mr.  Uccellini  and  came  to
believe  Mr.  Proenza  was  not  following  procedures.  The  items  cited  in  the  memo-
randum  were  drawn  from  incidents  recorded  by  Mr.  Uccellini:  one  case  where  Mr.
Proenza  signed  a  promotion  form  for  an  employee  (Mr.  Uccelini’s  responsibility,  a
second  case  was  stopped  before  it  completed  processing)  and  a  case  where  Mr.
Proenza approved change-of-station expenses outside the procedure approved by the
NOAA Corporate Board. Mr. Uccellini said that he had only learned about the inci-
dent  where  Mr.  Proenza’s  change  of  name  to  ‘‘National  Hurricane  Center’’  set  off
warning alarms after the fact, and that the change occurred without necessary noti-
fication to Congress and a 60-day waiting period. At this meeting, Mr. Uccellini also
characterized  Mr.  Proenza—whom  he  had  worked  with  in  the  past—as  a  dedicated
employee,  with  a  reputation  for  going  around  channels  and  being  disruptive.  Ms.
Glackin  described  Proenza  as  receptive  and  cooperative,  but  she  notes  that  the
memo  was  in  the  press  by  the  next  day  and  she  believes  that  Mr.  Proenza  must
have leaked his own ‘‘repremand’’ memo to the press—though there is no convincing
proof of that.

‘‘A couple of days’’ after delivering this memorandum to Mr. Proenza, Ms. Glackin
says  she  received  a  call  (at  another  point,  she  said  she  received  an  e-mail)  from
Ahsha  Tribble,  the  Executive  Officer  (who  came  to  the  position  just  last  September
after  serving  as  Technical  Chief  of  Staff  to  James  Mahoney—now  retired,  but  she
is seen also as being close to Admiral Lautenbacher and/or his staff) at the Center.
Ms. Tribble apparently indicated there were a number of employees who wanted to
bring their concerns to the attention of management. In a call with multiple employ-
ees  arranged  by  Ms.  Tribble,  Ms.  Glackin  says  the  employees  expressed  discomfort
with  the  work  environment  at  the  Center,  felt  that  their  opinions  were  being  mis-
represented,  and  that  the  Center  would  not  be  ‘‘cohesive’’  in  a  hurricane  situation.
Ms.  Glackin  said  she  raised  these  concerns  ‘‘vigorously’’  with  her  superiors.  It  was
sometime  after  this  point  that  the  ‘‘Operational  Assessment  Team’’  was  formed  at
the direction of Admiral Lautenbacher. The team was headed by the Deputy Direc-
tor  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  James  Turner,  and  in-
cluding John Guenther, an attorney from the Employment and Labor Law Division
of the Department of Commerce Office of General Counsel. The charge to this group
was issued on July 29, 2007—approximately 10 days after Ms. Glackin had received
allegations from NHC staff.

On  July  2,  Mr.  Proenza  told  Committee  staff  he  received  a  call  from  Admiral
Lautenbacher  that  the  Team  had  been  dispatched;  they  arrived  at  his  office  while
the  call  was  still  in  progress.  It  seemed  apparent  to  him  that  others  in  the  Center
were  already  aware  that  the  Team  was  coming.  Mr.  Proenza  met  with  Turner,  and
an ‘‘all-hands’’ meeting with the Center staff followed.

On July 4, the Miami Herald reported that Senior Specialists Richard Knabb and
James Franklin—along with a third, Richard Pasch—believed that Mr. Proenza had
damaged public confidence in the Center and should be removed. Mr. Franklin was
quoted  as  saying  ‘‘. . .the  hurricane  specialists,  by  and  large,  do  not  agree  with
much of what he has done;’’ the article also stated that ‘‘shouting matches’’ had oc-
curred between staffers supporting and opposing Mr. Proenza. On July 5, an e-mail
was  distributed  to  the  Center  staff  inviting  them  to  a  meeting  ‘‘to  openly  discuss
recent  events.’’  At  that  meeting,  attendees  were  invited  to  go  to  a  second  room  in
a  campus  building  owned  by  Florida  International  University  to  view  and  sign  the
statement  that  was  released  to  the  media.  It  is  also  at  this  point  that  concerns  are
raised  about  the  possibility  that  funds  supporting  aircraft  flights  would  be  repro-
grammed to build a replacement QuikSCAT. As far as staff can determine, that pro-

posal  had  never  been  made  by  any  Member  and  would  be  unlikely  given  the  vast
difference in the financial scope of the two programs.

Ms.  Glackin  told  staff  that  a  call  was  received  on  July  6  indicating  that  the  As-
sessment  Team  felt  Mr.  Proenza’s  actions  were  inhibiting  the  ability  of  the  Team
to  conduct  their  review.  Admiral  Lautenbacher  discussed  the  situation  with  the
Team.  On  July  7,  Admiral  Lautenbacher  sent  a  memorandum  to  the  Center  staff
indicating Mr. Proenza was placed on leave and named Mr. Rappaport as acting Di-
rector. Mr. Proenza received the letter informing him he was on leave until August
9  as  he  arrived  at  Miami  airport  July  9.  He  was  also  told  that  he  should  not  go
to  the  Center  offices  without  permission  from  Mr.  Uccellini  and  that  he  should  not
contact members of the Center staff.

A document request was sent to NOAA July 12 from Chairman Gordon, Chairman
Lampson,  and  Chairman  Miller  of  this  committeee,  and  Chairman  Dingell  and
Chairman Stupak of the Energy and Commerce Committeee, asking for records cov-
ering  Ms.  Glackin’s  June  14  memorandum  and  communications  between  various
NOAA officials concerning Mr. Proenza.

At this point, a number of important questions remain:

NOAA?

• Why  was  Proenza  chosen  to  be  Director  of  the  highest  profiled  Center  at
• Beyond  the  items  listed  in  the  Glackin  memorandum—which  NOAA  stresses
was  not  a  reprimand  document  and  was  not  placed  in  Mr.  Proenza’s  per-
sonnel file—are there any other actions that better justify the action to place
Proenza on leave?
• Why was there such a depth of dissatisfaction over Proenza’s focus on a par-
• What  is  needed  to  properly  equip  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center,  and  are
• Was  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  incapable  of  carrying  out  its  core  task  of

was dispatched by Admiral Lautenbacher?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  hearing  will  come  to  order.  I  wish  you
all a good morning. Welcome to today’s hearing which we have en-
titled ‘‘Tracking the Storm at the National Hurricane Center.’’

We  are  here  today  to  examine  the  situation  that  has  developed
over the past few weeks at the National Hurricane Center. Things
may be relatively calm over the Atlantic but it has been somewhat
stormy at the Center, and this is a situation that must be resolved
so  this  organization  can  do  its  important  work  for  the  public,  fore-
casting hurricanes and issuing warnings to the emergency manage-
ment  community  and  to  the  public.  They  have  been  an  extremely
important  part  of  my  life  for  many,  many  years  that  I  have  lived
on  the  Gulf  Coast  of  this  country  where  we  have  had  some  fairly
serious storms, as you all know.

Today we will hear from Mr. Bill Proenza, who was asked by Ad-
miral Lautenbacher to become the Director of the Hurricane Center
in December of last year. Mr. Proenza did not apply for this job or
ask  to  be  considered  for  the  opening  created  by  the  retirement  of
Mr.  Max  Mayfield.  Mr.  Proenza  was  well  known  to  the  Southern
Region  and  by  his  superiors  at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  (NOAA)  headquarters.  He  led  the  Southern
Region  Office  of  the  National  Weather  Service  for  the  past  seven
years,  and  due  to  that  position  served  on  the  NOAA  corporate
board.  By  all  accounts,  he  has  a  reputation  for  speaking  his  mind
and  occasionally  ruffling  feathers  in  an  effort  to  change  the  way
things  are  done  inside  the  National  Weather  Service  when  he  be-
lieved that it was in the public interest to do so. So NOAA leader-
ship selected an experienced and dedicated NWS—National Weath-
er Service—manager to be the new Director of the Hurricane Cen-
ter. Now, before he had been in the position for even a single hurri-
cane  season,  NOAA  dispatched  an  assessment  team  to  the  Center.
A  number  of  employees  at  the  Center  have  become  upset  enough
to call for Mr. Proenza to step down and Admiral Lautenbacher has
placed Mr. Proenza on temporary leave from the position he asked
him to accept just seven months ago.

In  the  background,  we  have  some  other  controversies.  Shortly
after  his  appointment  to  the  Hurricane  Center,  Mr.  Proenza  drew
attention to the fact that a satellite, QuikSCAT, that provides data
used in forecasting, was beyond its design life and if it failed, fore-
casts  could  be  degraded,  and  as  I  understand  it,  he  wanted  NOAA
to  prepare  for  this  possibility  and  have  a  plan  to  replace  it.  His
statements to the press about this issue clearly made NOAA head-
quarters uncomfortable, uncomfortable enough that Acting Director
of the Weather Service, Mary Glackin, issued Mr. Proenza a memo
on  June  14  stating  the  belief  that  Mr.  Proenza’s  statements  were
undermining confidence in the Center’s forecasting abilities.

What  is  going  on?  That  is  all  we  would  like  to  know.  This  is  a
hurricane  season.  The  only  storms  the  Center  should  be  dealing
with are those that form out in the ocean. I still don’t fully under-
stand  why  Admiral  Lautenbacher  believed  that  dispatching  an  as-
sessment  team  with  little  experience  or  knowledge  of  the  National
Weather  Service  or  forecasting  to  the  Center  was  the  appropriate
way  to  deal  with  staff  complaints  about  Mr.  Proenza.  It  seems  the
arrival  of  the  Assessment  Team  exacerbated  problems  with  the
staff and has left the National Hurricane Center without a director.

Is  this  the  case  of  a  disruptive  renegade  manager  that  has  mis-
treated  and  alienated  the  staff  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center
and  has  put  its  forecasts  and  warning  mission  in  jeopardy  or  has
NOAA  leadership  helped  to  foster  staff  resentment  of  Mr.  Proenza
and  used  this  resentment  to  justify  removing  a  career  employee
who  embarrassed  NOAA’s  leadership  by  pointing  out  the  short-
comings  in  the  agency  budgets  and  their  failure  to  plan  for  future
replacement  of  essential  forecasting  equipment?  I  don’t  know  but
we are going to try to figure it out and to figure out what has hap-
pened.

At a minimum, NOAA leadership has made at least two bad de-
cisions. First, either Mr. Proenza was the wrong choice to lead the
Hurricane  Center  in  December  or  it  was  premature  to  send  in  an
assessment team and remove him in July. The second bad decision
was  the  Admiral’s  failure  to  inform  me  and  two  other  Members  of
this  committee  that  he  met  with  on  June  27  of  the  potential  prob-
lems  at  the  Hurricane  Center  or  his  plan  to  send  an  assessment
team  there  on  July  2.  It  is  clear  from  the  documents  we  received
last  night  that  Admiral  Lautenbacher  not  only  was  aware  of  the
problems  but  had  already  set  the  plans  in  motion  to  dispatch  the
Assessment Team to Miami.

We cannot afford any more bad decisions. It is hurricane season,
and  if  we  want  to  make  it  personal,  I  can.  I  live  there,  where  we
have been displaced multiple times from our homes, damage to our
homes,  fright  to  our  children.  The  people  at  the  Center  need  to
work together to perform the essential task this nation needs: pro-
viding  forecasts  and  warnings  of  hurricanes.  The  Center  needs
strong,  competent  leadership  to  serve  the  public.  This  is  serious
business  and  we  need  to  straighten  this  out  before  we  are  in  the
midst of a real storm.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good  morning.  We  are  here  today  to  examine  the  situation  that  has  developed

over the past few weeks at the National Hurricane Center.

Things  may  be  relatively  calm  over  the  Atlantic,  but  it  has  been  stormy  at  the
Center  and  this  is  a  situation  that  must  be  resolved  so  this  organization  can  do  its
important  work  for  the  public—forecasting  hurricanes  and  issuing  warnings  to  the
emergency management community and the public.

Today,  we  will  hear  from  Mr.  Bill  Proenza,  who  was  asked  by  Admiral
Lautenbacher  to  become  the  Director  of  the  Hurricane  Center  in  December  of  last
year. Mr. Proenza did not apply for this job or ask to be considered for the opening
created by the retirement of Mr. Max Mayfield.

Mr.  Proenza  was  well-known  to  the  Southern  Region  and  by  his  superiors  at
NOAA  Headquarters.  He  led  the  Southern  Region  Office  of  the  National  Weather
Service  (NWS)  for  the  past  seven  years  and,  due  to  that  position,  served  on  the
NOAA Corporate Board.

By  all  accounts  he  has  a  reputation  for  speaking  his  mind  and,  occasionally  ruf-
fling feathers in an effort to change the way things are done inside the NWS when
he believed it was in the public interest to do so.

So,  NOAA  leadership  selected  an  experienced  and  dedicated  NWS  manager  to  be

the new Director of the Hurricane Center.

Now, before he has been in the position for a single hurricane season, NOAA has
dispatched an assessment team to the Center, a number of employees at the Center
have  become  upset  enough  to  call  for  Mr.  Proenza  to  step  down,  and  Admiral
Lautenbacher  has  placed  Mr.  Proenza  on  temporary  leave  from  the  position  he
asked him to accept just seven months ago.

In  the  background,  we  have  some  other  controversies.  Shortly  after  his  appoint-
ment  to  the  hurricane  center,  Mr.  Proenza  drew  attention  to  the  fact  that  a  sat-

ellite—QuikSCAT—that provides data used in forecasting was beyond its design-life
and, if it failed forecasts could be degraded.

As  I  understand  it,  he  wanted  NOAA  to  prepare  for  this  possibility  and  have  a
plan to replace it. His statements to the press about this issue, clearly made NOAA
Headquarters  uncomfortable—uncomfortable  enough  that  Acting  Director  of  the
Weather Service, Mary Glackin issued Mr. Proenza a memo on June 14 stating the
belief  that  Mr.  Proenza’s  statements  were  undermining  confidence  in  Center’s  fore-
casting abilities.

What  is  going  on?  That’s  what  we’d  all  like  to  know.  This  is  hurricane  season.
The  only  storms  the  Center  should  be  dealing  with  are  those  that  form  out  in  the
ocean.  I  still  do  not  fully  understand  why  Admiral  Lautenbacher  believed  that  dis-
patching  an  assessment  team  with  little  experience  or  knowledge  of  NWS  or  fore-
casting  to  the  Center  was  the  appropriate  way  to  deal  with  staff  complaints  about
Mr.  Proenza.  It  seems  the  arrival  of  the  Assessment  Team  exacerbated  problems
with the staff, and has left the NHC without a Director.

Is  this  the  case  of  a  disruptive,  renegade  Manager  that  mistreated  and  alienated
the  staff  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center  and  has  put  its  forecast  and  warning
mission  in  jeopardy?  Or  has  NOAA  leadership  helped  to  foster  staff  resentment  of
Mr.  Proenza  and  used  this  resentment  to  justify  removing  a  career  employee  who
embarrassed NOAA leadership by pointing out shortcomings in the Agency budgets
and  their  failure  to  plan  for  future  replacement  of  essential  forecasting  equipment?
I  don’t  know,  but  we  are  going  to  try  to  figure  out  was  has  happened.  At  a  min-
imum,  NOAA  leadership  has  made  at  least  two  bad  decisions.  First,  either  Mr.
Proenza was the wrong choice to lead the Hurricane Center in December or, it was
premature to send in an assessment team and remove him in July. The second bad
decision was the Admiral’s failure to inform me and two other Members of this com-
mittee  he  met  with  on  June  27  of  potential  problems  at  the  Hurricane  Center  or
his plan to send an assessment team there on July 2.

It  is  clear  from  the  documents  we  received  last  night,  Admiral  Lautenbacher  not
only was aware of the problems, but had already set the plans in motion to dispatch
the Assessment Team to Miami.

We cannot afford any more bad decisions. It’s hurricane season. The people at the
Center  need  to  work  together  to  perform  the  essential  task  this  nation  needs—pro-
viding  forecasts  and  warnings  of  hurricanes.  The  Center  needs  strong,  competent
leadership  to  serve  the  public.  This  is  serious  business  and  we  need  to  straighten
this out before we are in the midst of a real storm.

Chairman LAMPSON. I will call on the Chairman of our Oversight

Subcommittee, the distinguished Mr. Miller.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  thank  Chairman  Lampson.  I  also  don’t
know  what  is  going  on  here  but  I  would  like  to  know  and  I  think
it  merits  a  closer  look  by  these  two  subcommittees  and  by  Con-
gress,  and  I  agree  with  Mr.  Lampson  that  the  work  of  TPC,  the
Tropical  Prediction  Center,  is  important  to  a  lot  of  Americans,  im-
portant  to  Mr.  Lampson  in  his  district.  It  is  important  to  me  in
North  Carolina.  In  the  last  11  years,  North  Carolina  has  been
badly damaged by a number of storms, particularly Floyd and Fran
have done a great deal of damage, and it is important that we have
the  best  forecasting  of  those  storms  that  we  possibly  can  so  that
we can be prepared to minimize the damage.

On  first  impression  of  what  has  happened  at  the  Tropical  Pre-
diction Center, the TPC, sounds like office politics, particularly bad
office  politics,  particularly  vicious  office  politics,  but  office  politics,
something  that  happens  every  day  all  across  America.  There  are
disgruntled  employees  who  are  having  trouble  adjusting  to  a  new
manager, not getting along with the new manager. There is a new
manager or new director who is trying to adjust to a new set of em-
ployees,  to  a  new  chain  of  command,  but  on  closer  look  there  are
certainly parts of this that don’t appear to add up, facts that don’t
quite  add  up,  something  doesn’t  seem  quite  right  and  it  certainly
merits a closer look by Congress to see if it is just particularly toxic
office politics or something that should concern us more than that.

We know that Mr. Proenza, Bill Proenza, before being named Di-
rector  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center,  the  TPC,  in  Miami  had
been a strong, well-regarded leader through seven years as head of
the  National  Weather  Service  in  the  Southern  Region.  By  all  re-
ports,  Mr.  Proenza  had  a  strong  relationship  with  the  Weather
Service  union.  He  was  seen  by  line  employees  as  one  of  their
staunchest  advocates,  staunchest  supporters.  The  contrast  to  the
apparently toxic relationship to the employees at TPC could not be
stronger, could not be more striking. We would assume that if Ad-
miral  Lautenbacher  was  convinced  that  Mr.  Proenza  would  be  the
right  replacement  for  Max  Mayfield,  he  must  have  thought  that
Mr.  Proenza  was  a  competent  leader  and  manager.  He  would  not
have  called  Mr.  Proenza  to  ask  him  to  take  that  position  if  he  did
not  think  that.  It  doesn’t  make  sense.  That  is  why  we  are  here
today  trying  to  understand  why  an  apparently  proven  leader  with
a  known  track  record  has  come  to  find  himself  in  such  grave  trou-
ble with his own employees and his own managers.

But  once  you  look  past  the  apparently  spontaneous  rebellion  by
employees  at  the  lab  at  the  TPC  and  look  at  what  has  happened
at  the  management  level  above  Mr.  Proenza  in  the  chain  of  com-
mand,  not  below  him,  there  are  further  questions  about  what  the
real  reason  is  for  what  has  gone  wrong.  The  question  becomes
whether  Mr.  Proenza  was  pushed  out  or  is  being  pushed  out  be-
cause  he  was  a  critic  within  NOAA,  not  because  of  his  difficulties
in  dealing  with  his  employees.  Is  it  because  he  is  a  whistleblower,
because  he  was  willing  to  stand  up  to  the  people  who  are  higher
than him in the hierarchy, not because of his relationship with the
people below him in the hierarchy?

Mr.  Proenza  called  attention  to  the  failure  of  NOAA  to  take  ag-
gressive  steps  to  find  a  replacement  for  QuikSCAT.  I  don’t  claim
to  know  all  the  technical  details  of  QuikSCAT  and  that  is  some-
thing  that  Mr.  Proenza  has  talked  about  again  and  again.  Some
have criticized his criticisms, his comments and the science for the
basis  for  some  of  his  observations,  but  Mr.  Proenza,  like  all  of  us,
has  had  to  rely  on  staff  for  information,  so  if  he  is  wrong  about
that,  there  is  certainly  blame  to  go  around.  It  is  not  all  his  fault
and  it  certainly  is  not  his  fault  for  raising  those  questions,  ques-
tions that many within NOAA and the Weather Service are raising.
And  it  is  hard  to  argue  that  the  degradation  of  QuikSCAT  or  one
model  matters  more  than  another,  well,  all  that  misses  the  point
that  virtually  everyone  in  the  meteorological  community,  all  the
people  who  really  do  know  what  they  are  talking  about  when  it
comes  to  this  agree  that  they  do  need  QuikSCAT,  so  the  loss  of
QuikSCAT is a real problem. The source for Mr. Proenza’s informa-
tion  shows  up  in  NOAA  presentations  to  the  National  Research
Council  in  April,  in  February’s  interagency  strategic  research  plan
for  tropical  cyclones  produced  by  the  Office  of  Federal  Coordinator
of Meteorology. To argue about the projected degradation or wheth-
er one model matters more than another just misses the point. He
has called attention to the amount of money that NOAA has spent
on celebrating its 200th anniversary, an amount that appears to be
more  than  $4  million  over  fiscal  year  2006–2007,  this  fiscal  year,
if you include the cost of employees working on the issue. He is op-
posed  to  Weather  Service  downsizing,  which  had  been  one  of  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

11

hallmarks  of  Mr.  Johnson’s  tenure  at  the  Weather  Service,  but  for
that he has earned the gratitude of Congress and of the employees’
union.  Not  every  manager  welcomes  a  critic  within  the  agency  but
Congress  certainly  does.  It  is  certainly  easier  for  us  to  do  our  job
in  oversight  if  we  did  not  face  a  smooth  wall  of  unanimity,  of  one
opinion without variation, and Mr. Proenza has certainly been will-
ing  to  be  a  critic  and  to  raise  questions  that  has  helped  us  do  our
job.

So  Chairman  Lampson,  I  look  forward  to  the  questions.  I  look
forward to finding out more about whether this is simply a case of
office politics or it is the case of an agency not welcoming criticisms
of Mr. Proenza.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Miller follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRAD MILLER

On  first  impression,  what’s  been  unfolding  at  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center
(TPC), it sounds like office politics, something that happens every day at workplaces
all  across  America.  Certainly,  there  are  disgruntled  employees  having  difficulty  ad-
justing  to  a  new  manager  and  a  new  Director  trying  to  adjust  to  a  new  chain  of
command.  But  on  a  closer  look,  something  just  doesn’t  seem  quite  right,  the  facts
don’t quite add up.

We  know  that  Bill  Proenza,  before  being  named  Director  of  the  Tropical  Pre-
diction  Center  (TPC)  in  Miami,  had  demonstrated  that  he  was  a  strong,  well-re-
garded  leader  throughout  his  seven  years  as  head  of  the  National  Weather  service
Southern  Region.  We  know  that  by  all  reports,  Mr.  Proenza  had  a  strong  relation-
ship with the Weather Service union, and was seen by line-employees as one of their
staunchest supporters.

We would assume, that if Admiral Lautenbacher was convinced that Mr. Proenza
would  be  a  superb  replacement  for  the  retiring  Max  Mayfield,  he  must  have  also
thought that Mr. Proenza was a competent leader and manager.

What  doesn’t  make  sense  is  why  we  are  here  today,  trying  to  understand  why  a
proven leader with a known track-record has come to find himself in grave difficul-
ties with his own employees and managers.

If you look past the apparently spontaneous rebellion by employees in the lab, and
look  past  what  has  unfolded  at  the  managerial  level  of  NOAA,  the  question  arises
whether Mr. Proenza was pushed out because he was a whistle blower, a truth tell-
er.

Mr.  Proenza  called  attention  to  the  failure  of  NOAA  to  take  aggressive  steps  to
find  a  replacement  for  QuikSCAT.  That  has  come  to  be  a  major  talking  point  for
Mr.  Proenza  in  recent  months.  Some  have  criticized  his  comments  and  the  science
underlying his observations. To these critics I would note that Mr. Proenza had been
relying  on  staff  for  this  information  and  so  the  blame,  if  there  is  any,  should  be
spread widely. In addition, to argue about the projected degradation or whether one
model  matters  more  than  another  misses  the  point  that  virtually  everyone  in  the
meteorological  community  agrees  they  need  QuikSCAT.  Finally,  the  source  for  Mr.
Proenza’s  information  shows  up  in  NOAA  presentations  to  the  National  Research
Council in April and in February’s ‘‘Interagency Strategic Research Plan for Tropical
Cyclones’’  produced  by  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorology.  To
argue about the projected degradation or whether one model matters more than an-
other misses the point.

He  also  called  attention  to  the  amount  of  money  being  spent  by  NOAA  to  cele-
brate its 200th Anniversary—an amount that appears to exceed $4 million over FY
2006–2007 if one includes the costs of employees working on the issue.

Finally,  Mr.  Proenza  opposed  the  weather  service  ‘‘down-sizing’’  efforts  that  had
been  the  hallmark  of  Mr.  Johnson’s  tenure  at  the  National  Weather  Service.  For
that he earned the gratitude of many in Congress and in the Union.

Not  every  manager  would  welcome  Mr.  Proenza’s  willingness  to  speak  out.  Some
would  see  him  as  an  annoyance.  In  addition  to  the  possible  motive  of  silencing  an
internal  critic,  the  actions  of  the  NOAA  management  suggest  that  something  isn’t
right  here,  that  this  isn’t  about  Mr.  Proenza’s  deficiencies  as  a  manager.  The  chro-
nology of events just doesn’t fit.

• By  the  spring  of  2007,  Louis  Uccellini,  Proenza’s  immediate  supervisor  and
head of the NECP, began keeping a file on Mr. Proenza containing apparently

minor administrative violations by Proenza. It should be noted that while Mr.
Uccellini  was  Mr.  Proenza’s  superior,  he  was  Mr.  Proenza’s  junior  in  the
weather  service  and  he  and  Mr.  Proenza  had  been  essentially  of  equal  rank
when Proenza was head of the Southern Region of NWS.

• In April of 2007, senior staff at NOAA met at the Admiral Lautenbacher’s di-
rection to work on something labeled in an e-mail as the ‘‘Proenza plan.’’ This
plan was to have five steps and be run by legal for review. . . It was shared
with  D.L.  Johnson,  then  head  of  the  National  Weather  Service  and  Jack
Kelly, Deputy Under Secretary at NOAA.

• On June 14, three days after being named as Acting Director of the Weather
Service, Ms. Mary Glacken approved a memo that listed Mr. Proenza’s minor
administrative  violations  that  Mr.  Uccellini  had  collected  and  urged  Mr.
Proenza to work through the chain of command and adhere more strenuously
to new NOAA media policy.

• On  June  21  or  22,  TPC  senior  forecasters—going  against  the  chain  of  com-
mand—complained  to  Ms.  Glacken  about  Bill  Proenza’s  leadership.  The  call
was organized by the Executive Officer in the Center, Dr. Ahsha Tribble, who
was seen by many at the TPC to be a ‘‘headquarters person.’’ Dr. Tribble had
arrived  at  the  Hurricane  Center  just  last  September  after  working  as  Tech-
nical  Chief  of  Staff  to  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and
Atmosphere.

• By  June  26,  Admiral  Lautenbacher  assembled  a  team  to  be  dispatched  from
Commerce to the Center to evaluate its operations. The team did not include
any  management  or  weather  experts.  Rather  than  turn  to  outside  parties
with  expertise  in  the  relevant  areas—administration  (National  Association  of
Public  Administration)  or  meteorology  (National  Academy  of  Science)—the
Admiral  selected  people  from  within  Commerce  who  had  no  background  in
weather  service  forecast  office  issues  and  little  expertise  in  the  science.  The
team’s preparation included meeting with the senior management figures who
had  played  a  role  in  preparing  Mr.  Proenza’s  June  memo  and  in  launching
the ‘‘Proenza plan.’’
• On July 2, the Team arrived on site. Mr. Proenza learned that this team was
being  sent  by  a  telephone  call  from  the  Admiral  that  was  designed  to  be
timed  with  their  arrival.  While  Mr.  Proenza  was  unaware  that  a  team  was
being  dispatched  to  the  Center  of  which  he  was  Director,  other  people  at  the
center knew of their pending arrival. Ahsha Tribble, apparently was assigned
to greet the Team and take them to Proenza’s office.

I hope that our witnesses today can explain some of this. I look forward to hearing
Mr.  Proenza’s  side  of  the  story.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  Admiral
Lautenbacher on his management of NOAA and of the TPC.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Chairman Miller.
The Chair now recognizes Mr. Inglis, Ranking Member of the En-

ergy and Environment Subcommittee, for an opening statement.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Great  nations  have  governments  that  ask  questions  of  them-
selves  so  we  are  here  to  ask  some  questions.  The  loyal  opposition
to the Administration, that would be my colleagues to my left, nat-
urally  smell  rats  from  time  to  time  and  it  could  be  that  there  is
a rat. The two Chairmen have just spoken about how perhaps this
is  a  critic  who  is  being  silenced.  I  think  the  evidence  may  show
here  today  that  it  is  equally  plausible  that  what  we  have  here  is
a  mismatched  manager  and  a  personnel  matter  and  nothing  more.
So  we  have  a  hearing.  Great  nations  have  governments  that  ask
questions  of  themselves  and  we  are  here  to  ask  questions,  and  we
have heard some speculation about some real rats out there. It may
be  a  fairly  straightforward  personnel  matter.  It  appears  that  the
Administration put a highly recommended and well-qualified direc-
tor  into  the  office  of  the  hurricane  director  and  thereafter  about
half  of  the  staff  at  that  Center  signed  a  letter  asking  that  Mr.
Proenza  to  be  removed.  Perhaps  they  are  acting  on  some  personal

vendetta,  that  may  be  shown  here  today,  or  perhaps  they  just
didn’t  like  his  management  style.  In  any  event,  the  administrator
clearly  did  the  right  thing  by  appointing  an  independent  panel  to
investigate the situation. That panel was chaired by Dr. Jim Turn-
er, who will testify here today.

Chairman Lampson mentioned that this fellow may not have ex-
pertise in hurricane forecasting, and I would ask, if you think it is
a management matter, why would you care if the fellow had exper-
tise in hurricanes? The question is management if it is a personnel
matter in which case you could hire a consulting firm to go and ask
questions.  It  happens  all  the  time.  Consultants  don’t  necessarily
know  how  to  make  a  chemical  product  in  a  chemical  factory.  They
don’t  have  to.  They  are  asking  management  questions  and  so  if
that is what it was, it is pretty clear that it is appropriate to form
a panel and go ask management-related questions.

We  can  agree  that  Mr.  Proenza  has  a  distinguished  resume  and
a history of positive performance reviews. Because of his success as
Southern Regional Director of the National Weather Service he ap-
peared qualified for the NHC Director position. In his new role, he
became  concerned  about  the  potential  loss  of  the  QuikSCAT  sat-
ellite. Some, as I understand it, would agree with Mr. Proenza that
QuikSCAT  helps  forecasters  better  understand  the  behavior  of
tropical storms. Others would assert that Mr. Proenza exaggerated
the impacts of the potential loss of the QuikSCAT.

Mr.  Proenza’s  management  style  will  be  discussed  here  today.
Surely we need a steady and reliable hand at the wheel of the Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center.  With  the  peak  of  hurricane  season  fast
approaching, Admiral Lautenbacher was told that Mr. Proenza had
become  so  disruptive  that  forecasters  were  saying  they  could  no
longer  do  their  jobs.  We  will  hear  today  that  Mr.  Proenza’s  man-
agement  style  became  such  an  issue  that  his  immediate  super-
visors  lost  confidence,  his  employees  lost  confidence  and  the  inde-
pendent operational Assessment Team lost confidence in his ability
to manage the Center. We will hear that Admiral Lautenbacher de-
cided  that  Mr.  Proenza,  as  qualified  as  he  had  been  at  the  outset,
was  perhaps  miscast  as  a  director  of  the  Center.  I  hope  my  col-
leagues  in  the  press  will  stay  around  to  hear  the  testimony  of  Ad-
miral  Lautenbacher  and  Dr.  Turner  to  hear,  as  Paul  Harvey  says,
the  rest  of  the  story.  Although  it  seems  odd  not  to  accord  a  senior
Administration  official  the  courtesy  of  testifying  at  the  outset  of
this  hearing  today,  and  the  Chairman  and  I  have  had  discussions
about  that,  I  trust  that  we  will  all  wait  to  form  conclusions  until
all the witnesses have testified.

I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
For  my  home  State  of  South  Carolina  and  many  others  in  coastal  areas,  the  Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  is  a  critical  national  resource.  The  lives  of  individ-
uals  and  families  depend  on  the  information  the  Center  provides.  Given  the  NHC’s
importance  for  protecting  our  citizens,  we  should  carefully  protect  the  integrity  of
the National Hurricane Center.

We may find that we are here today discussing a fairly straightforward personnel
matter.  It  appears  that  the  Administration  put  a  highly  recommended  and  well
qualified director into the office of Hurricane Director. Thereafter, about half of the

staff  at  the  Hurricane  Center  signed  a  letter  asking  that  Mr.  Proenza  be  removed.
Perhaps  they  were  acting  on  some  personal  vendetta.  Perhaps  they  just  didn’t  like
his management style.

In any event, the Administrator did the right thing by appointing an independent
panel  to  investigate  the  situation.  That  panel  was  chaired  by  Dr.  Jim  Turner,  who
will testify here today.

We  can  agree  that  the  Mr.  Proenza  has  a  distinguished  resume  and  a  history  of
positive performance reviews. Because of his success as Southern Regional Director
of  the  National  Weather  Service,  he  appeared  qualified  for  the  NHC  Director  posi-
tion. In his new role, he became concerned about the potential loss of the QuikSCAT
satellite. Some would agree with Mr. Proenza that QuikSCAT helps forecasters bet-
ter  understand  the  behavior  of  tropical  storms;  others  would  assert  that  Mr.
Proenza exaggerated the impacts of a potential loss of QuikSCAT.

Mr.  Proenza’s  management  style  will  be  discussed  here  today.  We  need  a  steady
and  reliable  hand  at  the  wheel  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  With  the  peak
of  hurricane  season  fast  approaching,  Admiral  Lautenbacher  was  told  that  Mr.
Proenza had become so disruptive that forecasters were saying they could no longer
do their jobs.

We  will  hear  today  that  Mr.  Proenza’s  management  style  became  such  an  issue

that:

• his immediate supervisors lost confidence,
• his employees lost confidence,
• and the independent operational Assessment Team lost confidence in his abil-

ity to manage the Center.

We  will  hear  that  Admiral  Lautenbacher  decided  that  Mr.  Proenza,  as  qualified

as he had been at the outset, was miscast as the Director of the Center.

I hope that my colleagues and the press stay around to hear the testimony of Ad-
miral  Lautenbacher  and  Dr.  Turner.  Although  it  seems  odd  to  not  accord  a  senior
Administration official the courtesy of testifying at the outset of this hearing today,
I trust that we will all wait to form conclusions until all of the witnesses have testi-
fied. Thank you Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis,  and  the  Chair  will
now  recognize  Mr.  Sensenbrenner,  the  Ranking  Member  on  the
Oversight  and  Investigation  Subcommittee,  for  an  opening  state-
ment.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In December of 2006, Mr. Bill Proenza was announced as the Di-
rector  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center.  In  July  of  2007,  after  his
superiors,  employees  and  an  independent  assessment  team  ques-
tioned  his  management  of  the  TPC,  the  administrator  of  the  Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration placed Mr. Proenza
on temporary leave pending the final recommendation of an assess-
ment  team.  The  independent  Assessment  Team  unequivocally
found  that  the  TPC  could  not  operate  effectively  under  Mr.
Proenza’s  leadership.  Our  country  is  in  the  middle  of  a  hurricane
season.  After  Hurricane  Katrina,  everyone  is  aware  of  how  dan-
gerous this season can be.

The  Tropical  Prediction  Center  compiles  data  about  ocean  tem-
perature,  wind  speed  and  direction,  barometric  pressure  and  other
factors  and  uses  this  data  to  forecast  hurricanes.  When  a  storm  is
within  three  days  of  a  potential  landfall,  the  TPC  issues  official
forecasts and warnings every six hours. As the storm gets closer to
land, the forecasts are updated even more frequently. Lives depend
on the work at the TPC.

Last month in the midst of an investigation of NASA’s Inspector
General,  I  warned  that  we  risk  creating  a  culture  of  overzealous
oversight. I reiterate that point today. There is a fine line between
good oversight and harmful interference. Playing politics with hur-
ricane  forecasters  endangers  the  lives  of  people  the  TPC  works  to

protect. Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, the Undersecretary of Com-
merce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere,  replaced  Mr.  Proenza  because
he  was  an  ineffective  director.  In  the  spring  of  this  year,  Mr.
Proenza  made  several  exaggerated  and  inaccurate  public  state-
ments  complaining  about  a  lack  of  resources  and  funding  at  the
TPC, the potential failure of one of the TPC satellites and NOAA’s
use  of  funds  for  the  200th  anniversary  celebration  of  the  Coastal
Survey.  In  an  independent  assessment  of  the  TPC  performed  by
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  reviewers  ob-
served  that  Mr.  Proenza  made  statements  about  the  limited  life-
time  of  the  QuikSCAT  satellite  and  the  resulting  impact  on  fore-
casts  ‘‘without  context  or  caveat.’’  The  reviewers  further  reported
that  many  staff  believe  that  Mr.  Proenza  intentionally  misrepre-
sented  their  views  and  repeated  certain  false  claims  even  after  he
was  corrected.  On  June  18,  Mary  Glackin,  the  Acting  Director  of
the National Weather Service, received phone calls from 11 employ-
ees  of  the  TPC  including  seven  out  of  the  nine  hurricane  fore-
casters  raising  concerns  about  Mr.  Proenza’s  leadership.  The  em-
ployees  complained  that  Mr.  Proenza  interfered  with  their  ability
to  do  their  jobs.  On  June  19,  Ms.  Glackin  communicated  her  fears
to  Admiral  Lautenbacher.  The  Admiral  then  sent  an  independent
assessment  team  to  report  on  the  situation.  Meanwhile,  staff  dis-
content  was  increasing.  Three  senior  forecasters  called  for  Mr.
Proenza’s  removal  and  nearly  half  of  the  46  staff  members  at  the
TPC signed a petition demanding his removal because according to
the  Center  staff,  the  effective  functioning  of  the  Center  was  at
stake  with  Mr.  Proenza  as  its  director.  On  July  6,  the  Assessment
Team  requested  that  Mr.  Proenza  be  placed  on  leave  because  he
was jeopardizing the Center’s ability to do its job. Three days later,
Admiral  Lautenbacher  informed  Mr.  Proenza  that  he  was  being
placed on leave.

Upon  completion  of  its  report,  the  independent  team’s  rec-
ommendation  was  unequivocal:  ‘‘The  current  TPC  director  should
be reassigned and not allowed to return to his position at the Cen-
ter.  This  should  be  done  due  to  his  failure  to  demonstrate  leader-
ship  within  the  TPC.’’  Such  substantial  questions  were  raised
about  Mr.  Proenza  that  a  failure  to  replace  him  would  have  been
irresponsible.  During  this  subcommittee’s  investigation  of  NASA’s
Inspector General, the Majority continuously objected to having an
inspector  general  in  place  who  did  not  have  the  confidence  of  his
staff.  In  the  present  situation,  employees  have  made  similar  com-
plaints  and  raised  the  same  concerns  about  Mr.  Proenza’s  leader-
ship.  I  have  no  doubt  that  if  Mr.  Proenza  was  still  serving  as  the
Director  of  the  TPC,  this  subcommittee  would  be  waving  the  em-
ployee  petition  in  front  of  Admiral  Lautenbacher  demanding  that
he  take  action.  Mr.  Proenza’s  name  would  have  been  added  to  the
growing list of personnel decisions demanded of the Administration
by Congress.

Instead,  the  Majority  is  questioning  the  veracity  of  the  employ-
ee’s  complaints.  In  a  July  12  letter  to  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  five
Democratic  Congressmen  wrote  that  ‘‘It  is  alleged  that  staff  was
pressured to sign onto what became a well-publicized letter of com-
plaint  against  Mr.  Proenza.’’  I  have  no  idea  who  made  this  allega-
tion. According to the Orlando Sentinel, staffers at the TPC angrily

objected  to  suggestions  that  some  were  pressured  into  signing  the
letter.  The  Center’s  Administrative  Officer  said  ‘‘no  one  was  pres-
sured  to  sign  that  letter  but  they  aren’t  calling  the  people  who
signed  it  to  find  it.  Why  not?  I  smell  politics  at  work  here.’’  Con-
spicuously,  none  of  the  employees  who  worked  under  Mr.  Proenza
at  the  TPC  are  here  to  testify  today.  Instead,  the  Majority  invited
two  Emergency  Management  officials  who  worked  with  him  when
he  served  in  his  former  position  as  Southern  Regional  Director  for
the  Weather  Service.  No  one  has  raised  any  issues  about  Mr.
Proenza’s  effectiveness  in  that  role.  The  complaints  here  have  all
been about his ability to lead the TPC. It appears that the Majority
has  held  today’s  hearing  and  questioned  the  independence  of  the
Center’s staff without even talking to the staff that made the com-
plaints.

Dr.  James  Turner  is  here  to  testify  about  the  findings  of  the
independent  Assessment  Team  but  he  is  here  because  he  was  in-
vited  by  the  Republicans.  The  Majority  was  prepared  to  hold  a
hearing  investigating  the  replacement  of  Mr.  Proenza  without  in-
viting the independent assessors who reported on the management
of  the  TPC  or  the  TPC  employees  whose  recommendations  and
complaint  lead  to  Dr.  Proenza’s  replacement.  No  wonder  the  Cen-
ter’s administrative officers smelled politics.

None of us are strangers to politics but to disregard our country’s
readiness  to  obtain  a  political  advantage  extends  beyond  reckless-
ness. I am disappointed that I have to state what should be the ob-
vious,  that  unwarranted  interference  with  the  operation  of  the
small hurricane center at its most critical time can only cause more
harm than good. The Tropical Prediction Center should be allowed
to focus on the hurricane season instead of being forced to weather
this Congressional storm.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR.

In  December,  2006,  Mr.  Bill  Proenza  was  announced  as  the  Director  of  the  Trop-
ical  Prediction  Center  (TPC).  In  July  2007,  after  his  superiors,  employees,  and  an
independent assessment team questioned his management of the TPC, the Adminis-
trator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) placed Mr.
Proenza  on  temporary  leave  pending  the  final  recommendation  of  the  Assessment
Team.  The  independent  Assessment  Team  unequivocally  found  that  the  TPC  could
not operate effectively under Mr. Proenza’s leadership.

The United States is in the middle of hurricane season. After Hurricane Katrina,
everyone is aware how dangerous this season can be. The Tropical Prediction Center
(TPC) compiles data about ocean temperature, wind speed and direction, barometric
pressure, and other factors, and uses this data to forecast hurricanes. When a storm
is within three days of potential landfall, the TPC issues official forecasts and warn-
ings every six hours. As a storm gets closer to land, the forecasts are updated even
more frequently. Lives depend on the work at the TPC.

Last  month,  in  the  midst  of  an  investigation  of  NASA’s  Inspector  General,  I
warned  that  we  risked  creating  a  culture  of  overzealous  oversight.  I  reiterate  that
point  today:  There  is  a  fine  line  between  good  oversight  and  harmful  interference.
Playing politics with hurricane forecasters endangers the lives of the people the TPC
works to protect.

Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and
Atmosphere,  replaced  Mr.  Proenza  because  he  was  an  ineffective  director.  In  the
spring  of  this  year,  Mr.  Proenza  made  several  exaggerated  and  inaccurate  public
statements  complaining  about  a  lack  of  resources  and  funding  at  the  TPC,  the  po-
tential failure of one of the TPC’s satellites, and NOAA’s use of funds for the 200th
Anniversary celebration of the coastal survey. In an independent assessment of the

TPC  performed  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  re-
viewers  observed  that  Mr.  Proenza  made  statements  about  the  limited  lifetime  of
the  QuikSCAT  satellite  and  the  resulting  impact  on  forecasts  ‘‘without  context  or
caveat.’’  The  reviewers  further  reported  that  many  staff  believed  that  Mr.  Proenza
intentionally  misrepresented  their  views  and  repeated  certain  false  claims  even
after he was corrected.

On  June  18,  Mary  Glackin,  the  Acting  Director  of  the  National  Weather  Service,
received phone calls from 11 employees of the TPC, including seven out of the nine
hurricane forecasters, raising concerns about Mr. Proenza’s leadership. The employ-
ees  complained  that  Mr.  Proenza  interfered  with  their  ability  to  do  their  jobs.  On
June  19,  Ms.  Glackin  communicated  her  fears  to  Admiral  Lautenbacher.  Admiral
Lautenbacher then sent the independent Assessment Team from NIST to report on
the situation.

Meanwhile, staff discontent was increasing. Three senior forecasters called for Mr.
Proenza’s removal and nearly half of the 46 staff members at the TPC signed a peti-
tion  demanding  his  removal  because,  according  to  Center  staff,  the  ‘‘effective  func-
tioning’’ of the Center was at stake with Mr. Proenza as its director. On July 6, the
NIST  Assessment  Team  requested  that  Mr.  Proenza  be  placed  on  leave  because  he
was  jeopardizing  the  Center’s  ability  to  do  its  job.  Three  days  later,  Mr.
Lautenbacher informed Mr. Proenza that he was being placed on leave.

Upon  completion  of  its  report,  the  independent  team’s  recommendation  was  un-

equivocal:

The current TPC director should be reassigned and not be allowed to return to
his position at the center. This should be done due to his failure to demonstrate
leadership within the TPC. . .

Such  substantial  questions  were  raised  about  Mr.  Proenza,  that  a  failure  to  re-
place  him  would  have  been  irresponsible.  During  this  subcommittee’s  investigation
of  NASA’s  Inspector  General,  the  Majority  continuously  objected  to  leaving  an  in-
spector general in place who did not have the confidence of his staff. In the present
situation,  employees  have  made  similar  complaints  and  raised  the  same  concerns
about Mr. Proenza’s leadership. I have no doubt that, if Mr. Proenza were still serv-
ing  as  the  Director  of  the  TPC,  this  subcommittee  would  be  waiving  the  employee
petition  in  front  of  Admiral  Lautenbacher  demanding  that  he  take  action.  Mr.
Proenza’s  name  would  have  been  added  to  the  growing  list  of  personnel  decisions
demanded of the Administration by Congress.

Instead,  the  Majority  is  questioning  the  veracity  of  the  employees’  complaints.  In
a July 12 letter to Admiral Lautenbacher, five Democratic Congressman wrote that
‘‘it  is  alleged  that  staff  was  pressured  to  sign  on  to  what  became  a  well-publicized
letter  of  complaint’’  against  Mr.  Proenza.  I  have  no  idea  who  made  this  allegation.
According  to  the  Orlando  Sentinel,  staffers  at  the  TPC  ‘‘angrily  objected  to  sugges-
tions that some were ‘pressured’ into signing the letter.’’

The Center’s Administrative Officer said, ‘‘No one was pressured to sign that let-
ter, but they aren’t calling the people who signed it to find it. Why not? I smell poli-
tics at work here.’’

Conspicuously, none of the employers who worked under Mr. Proenza at the TPC
are here to testify today. Instead, the Majority invited two emergency management
officials who worked with Mr. Proenza when he served in his former position as the
Southern  Region  Director  for  the  National  Weather  Service.  No  one  has  raised  any
issues  with  Mr.  Proenza’s  effectiveness  in  that  role.  The  complaints  have  all  been
about  his  ability  to  lead  the  TPC.  It  appears  that  the  Majority  has  held  today’s
hearing and questioned the independence of the Center’s staff without even talking
to the staff that made those complaints.

Dr. James Turner is here to testify about the findings of the independent Assess-
ment  Team,  but  he  is  here  because  he  was  invited  by  the  Minority.  The  Majority
was prepared to hold a hearing ‘‘investigating’’ the replacement of Dr. Proenza with-
out inviting the independent assessors who reported on management of the TPC or
the  TPC  employees  whose  recommendations  and  complaints  lead  to  Dr.  Proenza’s
replacements. No wonder the Center’s Administrative Officer smelled politics.

None  of  us  are  strangers  to  politics,  but  to  disregard  our  country’s  readiness  to
obtain  a  political  advantage  extends  beyond  recklessness.  I  am  disappointed  that  I
have to state what should be obvious, that unwarranted interference with the oper-
ation of a small hurricane center at its most critical time can only cause more harm
than  good.  The  Tropical  Prediction  Center  should  be  allowed  to  focus  on  the  hurri-
cane season instead of being forced to weather this Congressional storm.

tion.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RON KLEIN

I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished Chairman of this subcommittee,
along with the Ranking Member for holding this hearing and allowing me to partici-
pate.  I  can  think  of  only  a  handful  of  issues  as  important  as  keeping  the  American
public safe from hurricanes and other deadly storms. It’s a fundamental duty of the
Federal Government that I and all Americans take very seriously. That’s why I have
taken  a  high  level  of  interest  in  the  health  of  our  weather  satellites,  and  in  par-
ticular, the Quick Scatterometer, otherwise known as QuikSCAT.

On  June  5,  2006,  NOAA  convened  a  workshop  with  other  federal  agencies  to  as-
sess,  among  other  things,  the  impact  of  satellite  surface  wind  speed  and  direction
measurements.  QuikSCAT,  one  of  two  weather  satellites  at  the  heart  of  the  work-
shop’s assessment, received several eye-catching quotes in support of its usefulness.
Rick  Knabb,  senior  hurricane  specialist  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  said,
‘‘When  QuikSCAT  is  gone,  it  will  be  like  going  back  seven  years  in  tropical  cyclone
analysis.’’ He also added, ‘‘Losing QuikSCAT would be like losing a limb, especially
for Tropical Analysis and Forecasting Branch.’’

I’ve  heard  similar  comments  during  my  many  meetings  with  NOAA  officials,  in-
cluding from General David Johnson, former Director of the National Weather Serv-
ice.  And  during  my  recent  visit  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  several  fore-
casters  independently  verified  to  me  the  value  of  QuikSCAT’s  data  when  detecting
and  analyzing  hurricanes  and  tropical  storms.  They  showed  me  how  the  cone  used
to  predict  the  path  of  a  storm  may  be  altered  when  QuikSCAT’s  data  is  incor-
porated, making the cone narrower and the timing of landfall more precise.

Now,  in  the  midst  of  the  controversy  surrounding  Mr.  Proenza’s  dismissal  as  di-
rector of the Center, I’m hearing comments that essentially retreat from the earlier
support  of  QuikSCAT.  There  are  accusations  that  Mr.  Proenza  misrepresented  or
overstated  the  science  when  saying  two-day  and  three-day  forecasts  would  be  ad-
versely affected by the loss of QuikSCAT, and one senior forecaster at the Hurricane
Center  even  compared  the  loss  of  QuikSCAT  to  ‘‘driving  a  BMW  with  cloth  rather
than leather seats.’’

This  sudden  retreat  concerns  me.  While  I  recognize  that  there  may  be  disputes
over  Mr.  Proenza’s  management  or  administrative  style,  I  am  not  in  a  position  to
evaluate  his  employment  status.  However,  while  I  recognize  that  disagreements
over scientific studies can occur among reasonable and reputable scientists, my fear
is that this retreat may be born out in part by political motivations.

Such  actions  may  have  distracted  us  from  legitimate  inquiries  into  QuikSCAT
along  with  NOAA’s  other  weather  satellites.  Fortunately,  this  committee  has  taken
its oversight responsibilities seriously and convened this hearing, inviting me to par-
ticipate.  I’m  very  grateful  because  from  the  very  beginning  of  my  interest  in
QuikSCAT,  I’ve  been  asking  two  very  simple  questions  to  NOAA.  How  did  we  get
to this point where a useful weather satellite is on its last legs with no replacement
set to launch, and what are NOAA’s short-term and long-term contingency plans to
replace  the  loss  of  its  data.  I  should  add  that  we  also  now  need  to  inquire  whether
the QuikSCAT retreat is legitimate and if this once-praised satellite has value. But
if  it  does,  I  feel  it  is  imperative  that  we  find  out  what  are  the  backup  plans,  when
it  fails,  to  replace  the  data  and  other  information  it  provides  in  the  evaluation  of
hurricanes and tropical storms.

I sincerely hope at the end of this hearing that I can leave and say that we have
logical,  supportable  answers.  But  if  I’m  not  satisfied,  I  intend  to  keep  pressing  to
ensure that our forecasters have the best resources and technology available to help
them keep the American public safe from hurricanes and other deadly storms. I look
forward  to  the  outcome  and  the  responses  of  the  distinguished  panelists  and  Sub-
committee  Members,  and  thank  the  esteemed  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member  for
their leadership on this issue.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  enter  into  the
record  selected  materials  that  have  been  provided  to  the  Sub-

Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  point  to  mention,  and  I  will  talk
with  Admiral  Lautenbacher  in  just  a  few  minutes  regarding  this,
but  we  did  ask  two  members  of  the  NOAA  management  chain  to
be  here  this  morning.  We  expected  them  to  be.  We  were  notified
at around 9:00 that they would not be here.

At this point, I would ask unanimous consent to allow Represent-
ative  Ron  Klein  to  join  us  here  on  the  dais  and  to  be  allowed  to
participate in this committee hearing. Is there objection?

Mr.  INGLIS.  Reserving  the  right  to  objection—hold  on  a  second.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Without  objection,  so  ordered.  Representa-

tive Klein, you are welcome to join us.

At  this  point  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  first  panel.  Mr.  Wil-
liam  Proenza  is  the  Director  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center,  the
National  Hurricane  Center,  National  Centers  for  Environmental
Prediction,  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration.  He
will  discuss  his  service  as  director  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Cen-
ter, the National Hurricane Center, and his experiences during the
recent  events  that  led  the  NOAA  administrator  to  place  him  on
leave.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  a  parliamentary  in-
quiry.  Is  it  not  the  practice  of  this  committee  to  require  witnesses
to  file  their  written  testimony  24  hours  in  advance  so  that  the
Members and the staff of the Committee can review that testimony
and draft appropriate questions?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  did  not  ask  for  testimony,  which  I  un-
derstand  is  common  practice.  With  circumstances  like  this,  we  did
ask for his biography and it was submitted.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. A further parliamentary inquiry. Has writ-
ten  testimony  been  submitted  in  a  timely  manner  by  all  of  the
other witnesses on the other two panels?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Yes.  Written  testimony  of  everyone  has

been submitted.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Further parliamentary inquiry. I am refer-
ring to the Committee rules governing procedure of the Committee
on  Science  and  Technology  that  says  insofar  as  is  practical,  each
witness  who  is  to  appear  before  the  Committee  shall  file  no  later
than  24  hours  in  advance  of  his  or  her  appearance  both  a  state-
ment of the proposed testimony and a CV in printed copy and elec-
tronic  form.  Why  was  it  not  practical  for  Mr.  Proenza  to  file  his
statement pursuant to the rules when it was practical for all of the
other witnesses to do so?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  He  submitted  his  bio,  which  is  what  we

asked him for.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Further  parliamentary  inquiry.  Then  why
did not the Chair ask for the proposed testimony, which is also re-
quired  under  the  rules,  since  apparently  all  of  the  other  witnesses
were able to submit proposed testimony?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  think  there  is  a  difference  between  the
two  types  of  information  that  was  coming.  I  think  that  it  is  tradi-
tional  when  persons  who  could  be  considered  whistleblowers  are
coming before a panel that they not be asked to submit written tes-
timony.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Well, a further parliamentary inquiry. It is
also  traditional  that  Administration  witnesses  appear  first  on  the
first  panel  rather  than  being  forced  to  wait  around,  and  that  was
my  practice  when  I  was  the  Chair  of  the  Committee  and  the  Clin-
ton  Administration  was 
in  office.  Why  was  not  Admiral
Lautenbacher  given  the  same  courtesy  that  tradition  has  allowed
Administration  witnesses  for  as  long  as  I  have  been  on  this  com-
mittee?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  made  the  determination  as  the  Chairman
to the order that we would have our witnesses come. That is at the
discretion of the Chair and that was the decision that I made.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  I  would  then  ask  unanimous  consent  pur-
suant to the tradition of this committee that Admiral Lautenbacher
be allowed to testify first as an Administration witness.

Chairman LAMPSON. I object.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  I  would  further  ask  unanimous  consent
that Mr. Proenza be excused because he has not filed his testimony
24 hours in advance as all the other witnesses have.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  He  is  not  required  to  be,  and  I  might  add
also that even your own actions for the Committee that you chaired
are  different  than  what  you  are  asking  right  now,  Ranking  Mem-
ber. And at this point our witnesses should know.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  I  would  ask  unanimous  consent  that  Mr.
Proenza be excused until he files the written testimony as all of the
other witnesses have.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  have  heard  enough  and  we  will  go  for-

ward with this witness, and as you know, the witnesses.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. I object.
Chairman LAMPSON. And we will go forward with this plan with

our committee as planned.

And  as  our  witnesses  should  know,  spoken  testimony  is  limited
to five minutes each. It is also the practice of the Subcommittee to
take  testimony  under  oath.  Do  you  have  objections  to  being  sworn
in?  You  also  have  a  right  to  be  represented  by  counsel.  Is  anyone
represented  by  counsel?  Are  you  represented  by  counsel  at  this
hearing? Please stand and raise your right hand.

Panel I

STATEMENT OF MR. WILLIAM PROENZA, DIRECTOR,

TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER

Mr.  PROENZA.  Chairman  Lampson,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking
Member Inglis, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, Committee Mem-
bers, thank you for inviting me here this morning.

Although for the position of National Hurricane Center I was not
a  candidate  as  was  mentioned,  I  was  really  happy  to  accept  as  a
lateral  career  movement  in  my  senior  executive  service  that  reas-
signment.  I  fully  felt  the  weight  of  this  position  and  I  dedicated
myself  to  its  mission,  the  mission  which  boils  down  to  the  highest
calling in government, the protection of life. I took over on January
3 as my predecessor retired on the same day.

A  quick  background  on  me.  I  am  a  meteorologist.  I  started  my
National  Weather  Service  career  in  the  mid  1990s  with  two  hurri-
cane  seasons  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center  and  then  another
three  seasons  flying  into  the  hurricanes  with  the  Hurricane  Hunt-
ers. However, a lot of my leadership experience was gained heading
the Weather Services for one of the world’s most severe weather ac-
tive areas, the Southern Region, since actually January of 1998, an
area that extends from New Mexico, includes Oklahoma and Texas
eastward  to  include  all  of  the  Gulf  states,  Georgia,  Florida,  Puerto
Rico,  the  Virgin  Islands,  and  hydrologic  services  include  South
Carolina, North Carolina and into Virginia as well. This region has
nearly 90 percent of the U.S. landfalling hurricanes. Our nation in
an  average  year  has  an  active  enough  hurricane  threat  in  the  At-
lantic  basin,  no  question  about  it,  but  since  1995  we  have  been  in
what  we  call  a  more  active,  multi-decadal  in  length,  period  in
which hurricanes are especially major. During this active cycle, our
nation’s  average  annual  losses  jump  from  $4  billion  per  year  to
nearly  $19  billion  per  year.  Furthermore,  our  culture  has  our  peo-
ple  liking  to  live  near  the  coast.  In  fact,  our  census  shows  us  that
about  53  percent  of  the  Nation’s  total  population  lives  within  the
first  50  miles  of  the  coastline,  an  important  consideration  as  we
face  the  challenges  of  the  future  for  the  Hurricane  Center  so  we
can  easily  see  why  building  the  preparedness  of  our  nation,  of  our
people,  building  our  partnership  with  emergency  management,
local  government  officials  and  Homeland  Security,  local  and  State
government and the media is so important to the National Weather
Service  and  a  major  activity  for  me,  especially  before  the  normal
season begins in June.

Another  major  concern  during  this  preseason  time  for  me  that  I
have spent in this position was assessing our readiness to maintain
our  mission  delivery  to  the  American  public,  and  while  the  Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center  has  never  been,  has  never  been  more
ready  for  a  season,  we  still  had  some  potential  problems.  But  al-
ready we have dealt with four tropical storms and dealt with them
without  any  problem.  One  was  what  we  called—one  of  the  prob-
lems  that  we  had  and  one  of  the  potential  problems,  what  we  call
the ocean sector surface vector winds which really is the wind field
above  the  ocean  that  is  so  important  for  hurricane  analysis.  It  is
vital  data  that  we  get  from  the  NASA  satellite  that  was  launched
in 1999, QuikSCAT, with an estimated lifespan of three, sometimes

people  will  say  five  years,  three  to  five  years,  but  it  is  now  in  its
eighth  year,  and  it  is  on  its  backup  transmitter.  Two  days  after  I
entered  the  National  Hurricane  Center  on  January  5,  my  staff
briefed NOAA Administrator Lautenbacher, NWS Director Johnson
and my then new immediate supervisor, Director Uccellini, on this
problem.  A  critical  satellite  on  borrowed  time  and  no  plans,  no
plans  to  replace  it.  That  presentation  from  January  5  stated  how
important this ocean surface wind field is from the everyday users
of this particular service, and I have quotes such as, from the sen-
ior  hurricane  specialists  that  are  on  my  staff  now, 
‘‘When
QuikSCAT is gone,’’ and I quote exactly, ‘‘It will be like going back
seven years in tropical cyclone analysis.’’ ‘‘Losing QuikSCAT will be
like  losing  a  limb,  especially  for  tropical  analysis  and  forecasting.’’
The  Navy  says  QuikSCAT  plays  a  critical  role  in  our  analysis  of
short-term  warnings  and  forecasts.  That  is  the  Joint  Typhoon
Warning Center in Pearl Harbor.

NHC  has  many  facts  that  we  look  at,  many  sources  of  data  but
one  thing  is  apparent  to  us  all  the  time  is  that  over  the  ocean  we
have a tremendous sparsity of data. We have some buoys, we have
some  satellites  that  look  over  the  cloud  features  across  the  ocean,
we  have  some  ship  reports,  but  when  it  comes  to  the  sparsity  of
data,  no  single  source  of  data  adds  more  information  to  us  for  the
analysis than QuikSCAT. The fact that this is a little known recent
NOAA publication that came out officially stated very clearly seven
years of QuikSCAT dependence and we don’t have plans in our gov-
ernment  to  replace  it  with  a  new  generation  version.  It  will  take
five years to develop and send up a new generation of satellite but
it  will  have  great  new  benefits.  But  don’t  take  my  word  for  it.  Dr.
Robert Atlas is here this morning, an expert on QuikSCAT from his
days at NASA and now one of our leading NOAA ocean and atmos-
pheric  research  scientists.  This  is  not  about  having  a  satellite
version that we could call a Chevy or a Cadillac. It is about having
one  reliable  latest  science,  what  we  call  ocean  surface  vector  wind
satellite that will help us protect life in the oceans and on land.

Despite  what  I  thought  was  a  reasonable  approach  to
QuikSCAT’s advocacy, I have asked myself why all this resistance.
The  fact  is,  NOAA  is  one  of  the  U.S.  departments  struggling  right
now with huge overruns, billions of dollars in its polar orbiting en-
vironmental satellite system and still nowhere in there, nowhere in
their  design  is  there  a  new  generation  listed  QuikSCAT  replace-
ment until the year 2016. An oversight? We are all concerned about
the  protection  of  life  of  our  people.  Perhaps  it  was  a  way  to  cut
costs, whatever. I dared to call attention to it. I dared to call atten-
tion to it, and by golly, I am going to pay the price for bringing this
to the attention of the American people.

On another matter.
Chairman LAMPSON. Can you wrap up because your time?
Mr.  PROENZA.  Sure.  Another  matter,  the  $200,000  that  was  di-
verted  for  the  Joint  Hurricane  Test  Bed.  It  was  used  for  one-  to
two-year  projects  translating  science  into  operations.  That  was  re-
moved this year, and I simply pushed to have it restored when my
deputy, my deputy in January said it would hurt the success of im-
proving  our  hurricane  monitoring  and  forecasting.  In  addition,  I
called attention to the fact that it was over $4 million in NOAA re-

sources for celebration of an alleged 200-year anniversary of NOAA
when  it  was  a  bit  of  a  stretch,  since  NOAA  was  formed  in  1970.
Most important, I didn’t feel in my opinion that self-promotion was
an acceptable way to use funds, especially when funds are tight. So
I  shared  all  of  this  early  on  with  my  chain  of  command,  with  my
partners  and  later  brought  it  to  the  attention  of  the  country  and
I  have  been  chastised,  threatened,  investigated,  recommended  for
reassignment,  discredited  after  more  than  40  years  of  dedicated
service  to  my  country.  The  investigation  was  extraordinarily  dis-
ruptive that came in to us that Monday and a surprise from Wash-
ington which triggered a frenzy of concern for mission delivery and
employee careers. I am still the Center’s Director. I need to go back
to  work.  I  am  ready  to  repair  bruised  relationships  wherever  they
may  be  with  whatever  mediators  and  things  that  we  feel  may  be
the  best  way  to  move  forward.  That  is  what  we  have  to  do  in  this
year’s hurricane season.

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  so  much  for  these  five  minutes.  I  am

at your Committee’s disposal.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIAM PROENZA

Bill  Proenza  is  the  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  in  Miami,
part of the National Weather Service (NWS), an agency of the Department of Com-
merce bureau, NOAA.

A 1967 meteorology graduate of The Florida State University, Proenza served two
hurricane  seasons  in  ’63  &  ’64  at  NHC  and  then  three  hurricane  seasons  as  an  as-
sistant  flight  meteorologist  (’65–’67)  on  the  ‘‘hurricane  hunter’’  aircraft.  He  contin-
ued  his  career  within  the  National  Weather  Service  for  more  than  40  years  receiv-
ing  numerous  performance  commendations  and  awards,  including  recognition  from
the  NWS  Employees’  Organization  as  the  NWS  Manager  of  the  Year  for  1998  for
his collaborative leadership.

Proenza  has  held  a  diverse  array  of  field  and  leadership  positions  and  his  mete-
orological  experience  ranges  from  leadership  in  the  modernization  of  weather  serv-
ices  as  well  as  managing  weather  forecasting  and  severe  weather  warning  services
as  well  as  climate  services.  He  rose  through  the  ranks  of  the  NWS  and  held  the
position of Director of the most severe weather-active area of our nation, the South-
ern  Region,  encompassing  one-fourth  of  the  Nation  from  New  Mexico,  Texas,  Okla-
homa eastward all the way to Florida and on across the Caribbean to include Puerto
Rico  and  the  Virgin  Islands  from  1998  through  the  end  of  2006  (acting  in  ’98).
Through  his  experience  in  the  southern,  north-central  and  eastern  portions  of  the
Nation, Bill has gained a unique familiarity with many types of weather from trop-
ical to intense winter weather and severe local storms.

Proenza  is  a  long  standing  member  of  the  American  Meteorological  Society,  the
National  Weather  Association,  the  International  Association  of  Emergency  Man-
agers and the National Emergency Management Association. In 2001, the American
Meteorological  Society  (AMS)  recognized  him  with  its  prestigious  ‘‘Francis  W.
Reichelderfer  Award’’  for  outstanding  environmental  services  to  the  Nation  and  in
2003, he was conferred the prestigious status of ‘‘Fellow of the AMS.’’ Just recently
in 2006, he was elected by his peers to the leadership board of the American Mete-
orological Society as a Counselor.

Proenza  is  an  internationally  recognized  meteorologist  and  has  represented  the
U.S.  Government  across  the  Caribbean  Basin.  In  2006  and  2007,  he  headed  the
United States Delegations to United Nations (UNESCO) meetings on tsunamis and
the  oceans.  Proenza  is  also  the  chairman  of  the  United  Nation’s  World  Meteorolog-
ical Organization’s Hurricane Committee, which supports 26 member nations in the
hurricane threatened nations of the Americas.

DISCUSSION

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Proenza.
It  is  time  now  for  our  first  round  of  questioning,  and  the  Chair

will recognize himself for five minutes.

NOAA ASSESSMENT TEAM

Mr. Proenza, when were you notified that NOAA was sending an

assessment team to the Hurricane Center?

Mr.  PROENZA.  I  received  a  call  from  Conrad  Lautenbacher,  an
Administrator  at  NOAA,  at  9:00  that  Monday  morning,  then  they
showed up knocking at my door. I did not know before then.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Was  anyone  else  on  your  staff  aware  that

the Team was arriving?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Yes,  sir.  I  talked  to  my  deputy  and  I  asked  him
if  he  knew  anything  about  it.  He  said  yes,  he  was  instructed  from
Washington  by  Louis  Uccellini  that  this  team  was  coming  down  to
the Hurricane Center but he was told not to tell me.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Did  anyone  from  NOAA  come  with  the

Team to the Center?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Two  people  from  NOAA  came.  One  was  a  senior
executive  service  person  from  the  satellite  service  of  NOAA,  an-
other  one  was  an  administrative  support  person  from  NOAA,  and
then three people from the Department of Commerce.

MEDIA EXPOSURE

Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  have  the  review  team’s  report,  and  I
want  to  ask  you  a  few  things  about  it  that  are  in  it.  Page  3  of  the
report  indicates  that  you  asserted  to  the  review  team  that  you
didn’t  want  anyone  going  to  the  media  about  the  assessment.  Is
that true?

Mr. PROENZA. That is correct. We were in the midst of the hurri-
cane  season.  I  wanted  to  have  a  minimal  exposure  to  what  was
going on in the Hurricane Center.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  report  goes  on  to  say,  ‘‘Nevertheless,
the  next  day  he  held  media  interviews  on  the  forecast  operations
floor  about  the  assessment  while  the  hurricane  specialists  were
performing their duties analyzing tropical activity.’’ Is this true?

Mr. PROENZA. That is correct again. Essentially those interviews
were set up by NOAA public affairs. A NOAA public affairs person
came  down  with  the  Team  in  addition  to  our  NOAA  public  affairs.
They coordinated on all of my interviews for the day and I just sim-
ply conducted the interviews I was instructed to conduct.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  you  just  answered  my  next  question,
did  you  arrange  those  interviews.  And  who  arranged  them?  Would
you tell me again?

Mr. PROENZA. The NOAA public affairs people there. There were
two  of  them,  a  Dennis  Feltgen,  who  is  normally  the  NOAA  public
affairs  person  for  the  Hurricane  Center,  and  the  person  that  came
down with the Team, Greg Romano, who is also a NOAA public af-
fairs person.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  way  the  report  is  written,  it  implies
that  you  were  being  disingenuous  with  the  assessment  team,  that
although you told them you didn’t want media attention on the as-
sessment,  you  actually  did  want  media  present  and  that  you  ar-
ranged  for  the  media  to  be  at  the  Center.  So  you  didn’t  want  the
media there and you did not arrange those interviews, correct?

Mr. PROENZA. That is correct, sir.

Chairman LAMPSON. I will turn to another example in the report.
Again on page 3, it states, ‘‘One specialist reported that the Direc-
tor  disrupted  his  ability  to  track  tropical  storms.  We  had  Barbara
and  Barry.  He  kept  bringing  the  media  over  onto  the  operations
floor  to  show  QuikSCAT  while  I  am  trying  to  put  out  a  forecast.
It  was  hard  to  get  the  job  done.’’  Do  you  remember  that  incident?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, I do.
Chairman LAMPSON. Do you want to tell me a little more——
Mr.  PROENZA.  Certainly.  It  was  a  case  where  we  had  Barbara
and we had Barry. I was on duty for both of those storms with the
two  hurricane  specialists  and  we  had  examples  where  we  could
show  that  the  sparsity  of  data  that  we  were  experiencing  over  the
ocean  where  these  storms  were  located,  and  what  we  could  show
was  the  QuikSCAT  coming  over  and  giving  us  the  data  that  we
needed. It was certainly momentary and it was always with the full
knowledge of knowing what was going on at the time.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  asked  if  the  media  could  be  brought

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman LAMPSON.—see that and he agreed?
Mr. PROENZA. I asked if we could show them what was going on

and how we were using analysis of QuikSCAT.

Chairman LAMPSON. And——
Mr. PROENZA. And they even demonstrated it themselves.
Chairman LAMPSON. And the response from him was?
Mr.  PROENZA.  ‘‘Yes,  and  I  will  demonstrate  it,’’  and  it  let  them

over to——

do the demonstration.

Chairman LAMPSON. Is it unusual for the media to be present on
the  operations  floor  of  the  Hurricane  Center?  I  was  of  the  impres-
sion  that  it  is  set  up  for  media  presence  during  storms.  Am  I
wrong?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Off  and  on  for  special  circumstances,  I  see  it  hap-
pening.  I  don’t  think  it  is  that  unusual  but  I  don’t  have  enough
time there to say.

STAFF DISSATISFACTION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  were  the  director  for  the  Southern  Re-
gion Office of the National Weather Service for seven years. During
that time, did NOAA ever send an assessment team to the regional
office?

Mr. PROENZA. No, sir.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Prior  to  the  arrival  of  this  team,  were  you
aware  that  members  of  the  staff  were  dissatisfied  with  your  man-
agement and leadership of the Center?

Mr. PROENZA. No, sir.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Was  there  any  resistance  to  change  and

concern about any public statements?

Mr. PROENZA. There was resistance to change as far as what we
were trying to do. One of the objectives that we had as we entered
the  season  and  looked  at  the  fact  that  we  had  growing  challenges
on  the  horizon  for  the  Nation’s  hurricane  warning  program,  I  sim-
ply  wanted  to  get  the  research  community  more  attuned  to  the
needs  of  what  the  operational  community  needed,  and  so  we  were
working  together  with  the  NOAA  side  of  the  research  group  that

is  there  in  Miami  in  the  South  Florida  area  and  we  had  a  great
cooperation working and they objected to that.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  My  time  has  expired.  I  will  now  recognize
Chairman  Miller.  I  am  going  to  relinquish  the  chair  to  Mr.  Miller
for five minutes.

Chairman MILLER. Mr. Proenza, how are you this morning?
Mr. PROENZA. Good. Thank you, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  The  last  questions  from  Chairman  Lampson
that  there  was  some  resistance  to  change  by  various  employees  of
the  Center,  did  you  think  that  there  were  any  problems  or  dif-
ferences  between  you  and  the  staff  that  could  not  be  worked  out,
that were so serious that they were beyond a solution?

Mr. PROENZA. No, not at all. It’s just the normal course of events
and how we implement change and we are doing it all the time in
the scientific environment.

QUIKSCAT

Chairman  MILLER.  You  talked  a  good  deal  about  QuikSCAT.  I
would  like  to  talk  about  that  a  little  more.  Did  you  ever  advocate
for  cutting  the  funding  for  the  hurricane  aircraft  to  fund
QuikSCAT?

Mr. PROENZA. Not at all.
Chairman MILLER. How are those two projects comparable?
Mr.  PROENZA.  First  of  all,  the  QuikSCAT  project  itself  when  it
was  asked  what  we  wanted  to  do  there,  I  said  that  indeed  the
NOAA  requirements  report  asked  for  something  to  be  started  im-
mediately  or  the  replacement  with  a  new  generation  of  satellite.  I
said  I  concurred  with  that.  I  said  also  though  I  wanted  to  make
sure  that  we  had  support  for  the  aircraft  and  for  the  later  model
developments we were seeking for the Doppler radar we wanted for
the Air Force, a whole slew of items that we feel are important for
the  future  our  capability  protecting  the  people.  But  in  addition  to
that,  when  they  said  well,  which  one  do  we  have  to  start  on,  well,
I  said  we  need  to  start  on  the  QuikSCAT  because  that  is  going  to
take  five  to  six  years  to  get  it  going  to  the  point  that  we  can  have
a possible launch and so I said that we needed to start immediately
on that and so I emphasized that.

Chairman MILLER. Also, the funding level required for the hurri-

cane planes versus the QuikSCAT satellite.

Mr. PROENZA. For the plane, it is about $50 million. For the sat-

ellite, it is $500 million.

Chairman  MILLER.  Some  of  the  senior  forecasters  at  the  Center
apparently  believe  that  your  comments  about  QuikSCAT  were  un-
dermining  public  confidence  in  the  Center’s  forecast  ability.  Why
did  you  continue  to  talk  about  QuikSCAT  and  the  failure  to  have
a satellite ready replacement?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Because  I  had  the  scientific  community,  I  had  my
own hurricane specialists telling me in their quotes how important
QuikSCAT  was  to  them  and  I  certainly  wanted  to  make  sure  that
I advocated their positions operationally.

HURRICANE SEASON: 2007

Chairman  MILLER.  How  well  prepared  are  we  for  the  current

hurricane season?

Mr.  PROENZA.  We  are  absolutely  as  prepared  as  we  have  ever
been.  We  have  a  new  model  on  board.  We  are  excited  about  that.
We  have  had  some  graphic  changes  that  we  put  into  the  web  site.
We  have  an  option  where  the  cone  of  uncertainty  has  been  rede-
fined  by  one  of  the  hurricane  specialists.  We  feel  that  that  would
be  more  accurate  and  we  are  also  having  a  toggle  where  the  user,
whoever that may be, can actually take a little black line that Max
used  to  say  don’t  focus  in  on.  They  can  take  it  off  and  put  it  back
on. We are doing that and we have an experimental tropical weath-
er  outlook  graphic  that  is  going  out  that  will  show  the  user,  the
public,  a  better  concept  of  where  the  active  areas  of  disturbed
weather are right now.

Chairman MILLER. Did you ever think that advocating for better
equipment  for  future  forecasting  in  any  way  undermined  the  fore-
casting or the confidence of the forecasts now?

Mr. PROENZA. No, absolutely not.

MORE ON QUIKSCAT

Chairman MILLER. Did anyone superior to you at NOAA, the De-
partment  of  Commerce  ever  tell  you  to  stop  talking  about
QuikSCAT?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Who were they? And what did they say?
Mr.  PROENZA.  I  had  a  call  on  Friday,  April  13,  and  it  was  from
my  immediate  supervisor,  and  the  statements  were,  ‘‘You  better
stop these QuikSCAT NHC funding associated with the Joint Hur-
ricane  Test  Bed  complaints.  I  am  warning  you.  You  have  NOAA,
DOC, OMB, the White House’’—excuse me—‘‘pissed off.’’

Chairman MILLER. I am sorry. Was that an oral statement or an

Mr.  PROENZA.  That  was  an  oral  statement  and  I  just  put  it  con-

temporaneously in my calendar.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  you  said  your  immediate  superior.  Was

from her?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  How  about  Mary  Glackin?  Did  you  ever  hear

Mr.  PROENZA.  Yes.  She  came  on  board  in  June,  June  11,  I  be-
lieve.  She  came  to  visit  us  at  the  end  of  that  week  and  she  said
in  her  time  that  she  has  been  on  board  as  the  Acting  Director  of
the  National  Weather  Service,  that  she  felt  she  was  spending  an
inordinate  amount  of  time  handling  QuikSCAT  questions  and
wanted me to cease and desist.

INTEGRATING RESEARCH AT THE HURRICANE RESEARCH

CENTER AND THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER

Chairman  MILLER.  I  understand  you  advocate  for  more  closely
integrated  research  done  at  the  Hurricane  Research  Division  with
the operational forecasting done at the Center, the National Hurri-
cane  Center.  Have  those  organizations  worked  together  histori-

cally? Why did you want them more closely linked? And was there
any resistance to having a closer relationship between——

Mr. PROENZA. The resistance I was told about and advised about
by  my  senior  staff  was  that  there  had  been  a  barrier,  so  to  speak,
between the two operations in the past and I said I understand but
I felt that it was compelling upon all of us based on the challenges
that those barriers were no longer to exist and we needed to bring
together  all  of  the  resources  that  we  had  in  NOAA  into  one  oper-
ation that would challenge the researchers to meet the needs of the
operational forecasters.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  my  time  is  also  expired,  Mr.  Proenza.  I

think we would now turn to Mr. Inglis for five minutes.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

DIRECTOR PROENZA’S TENURE AT THE NATIONAL

HURRICANE CENTER

Mr.  Proenza,  this  Administration  was  bitten  badly  by  Katrina.
The  theory  of  the  case  for  you  brought  forward  by  the  majority  is
that  you  are  being  punished  for  being  a  critic.  If  this  Administra-
tion,  having  been  bitten  by  Katrina,  were  interested  in  not  devel-
oping  the  best  technology,  it  would  be  surprising  to  me.  Is  it  sur-
prising  to  you  that  the  Administration,  having  been  bitten  by
Katrina,  would  not  want  the  very  best  technology  and  would  see
it as a crucial priority of this Administration?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Congressman,  even  if—if  I  can  point  to  a  publica-
tion from NOAA that looked at our requirements and said that we
needed to do this, I can assure you, at the time that I brought the
need for the QuikSCAT replacement with the new technology to my
superiors,  there  was  no  plans  to  replace  this  particular  satellite
and  only  later  this  year  did  they  mention  that  they  would  have
something for us possibly by 2016.

Mr.  INGLIS.  The  government  is  very  good  at  reacting.  That  is
what  we  do  very  well  and  so  if  this  Administration  is  reacting  to
the  stimulus,  the  very  unfortunate  stimulus  of  Katrina,  doesn’t  it
stand  to  reason  that  they  would  react  and  say  whatever  it  takes,
get it quickly?

Mr. PROENZA. I totally embrace that any way that I can work to-

wards getting that a reality.

Mr.  INGLIS.  The  thing  is,  that  undermines  your  whole  theory  of
this  case.  It  undermines  the  Majority’s  theory  of  the  case  because
their theory is, you are being punished for being a critic. You would
be the hero for pointing out some better technology if the Adminis-
tration had been so bitten, wouldn’t it?

Mr. PROENZA. I am trying to point out that we need to work im-
mediately to begin bringing the latest science and technology to the
forefront  and  the  design  of  a  new  instrument  that  would  be  able
to replace QuikSCAT whenever it is possible.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Let  me  ask  you  this.  Can  you  give  me  the  names  of
three people at the Center who I could call who would say that you
are a good leader?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes.
Mr. INGLIS. Will you give me their names?
Mr. PROENZA. Chris Landsea.
Mr. INGLIS. Let me get this down. Chris Landsea, L-a-n-c-e-y?

32

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, L-a-n-d-s-e-a. You know, Congressman, just a
moment. I don’t want to put words or expectation in any employee
of  mine’s  mind  and  I  want  them  to  feel  free  to  say  whatever  they
want  to  say.  I  would  just  suggest  that  there  are  employees  there
that  would  feel  that  way.  I  just  don’t  want  to  invade  their  privacy
and say—and put words in their mouth that they——

Mr. INGLIS. I am just interested in talking with them to see who

you think at the Center would say you are a good leader?

Mr. BAIRD. Would the gentleman yield for one moment, if I may?
Mr. PROENZA. Would I——
Mr.  BAIRD.  I  am  not  asking  the  witness.  I  am  asking  my  col-

league to yield for just a moment.

Mr. INGLIS. I don’t have enough time, I don’t think.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Well,  I  understand  that,  but  there  are  procedural

legal issues that the gentleman may be treading upon here.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Am  I  yielding?  I  guess  I  was  yielding,  but  I  con-
sumed  some  of  the  time.  I  suppose  I  can  get  the  time  back,  Mr.
Chairman.

Mr. Proenza, the third one.
Mr.  PROENZA.  I  just  feel  awkward  about,  there  are  all  sorts  of
people,  sir,  that  I  don’t  want  to  make  them,  invade  their  privacy
by  bringing  their  names  up,  and  giving  them  the  expectation  that
I feel——

Mr.  INGLIS.  Let  me  ask  you  this.  Why  do  you  think  23  people
signed  a  letter  saying  you  should  be  removed,  23  out  of  the  46.
That is about half, isn’t it?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Sir,  I  wasn’t  there  when  they  held  the  meeting,
and  several  people  stood  before  the  rest  of  the  employees,  and
asked them to sign, and the reasons why, I didn’t hear those argu-
ment. It would be hard for me to judge——

Mr. INGLIS. Let me ask you this. If you, even if you were certain
that somebody said before them, I would be really concerned about
signing  such  a  letter,  because  I  would  be  afraid  that  maybe  you
were  going  to  get  me  after  I  signed  the  letter,  so  there  is  a  real
resistance to me signing the letter, right?

So,  if  I  sign  the  letter,  23  people  overcoming  that  natural  resist-
ance, again, it cuts against the theory of the majority here. The 23
had to overcome enormous resistance to sign the letter, to put their
name  to  it.  Now,  I  am  asking  you  for  three  people  that  I  can  call,
and ask who would say that you are a good leader.

Mr. PROENZA. I understand, sir.
Mr.  INGLIS.  And  you  wouldn’t  have  any  trouble  coming  up  with

three more names.

them.

Mr. PROENZA. No, it isn’t that at all.
Mr.  INGLIS.  And  then,  you  are  trying  to  stop  me  from  calling

Mr.  PROENZA.  No,  no.  You,  sir,  you  have  whatever  authorities
you  have  to  do  whatever  you  want  to  do.  I  am  just  saying  upon
thinking of your question, with all respect, I just feel that it would
be wrong of me to list names of some of the people that I supervise,
or  I  am  in  the  chain  of  command,  and  say  that  they  are  going  to
say something about me.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Yes,  I  understand.  You  said  that  before.  And  let  me
ask  you  this,  because  my  time  is  running  out.  You  have  spoken

here a lot today about QuikSCAT, and you spoke about the impor-
tance of the work of the Center, but I notice you never spoke about
the dedication of the people and their expertise. Would you describe
yourself as a people person?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Sir,  I  said  that  the  Hurricane  Center  has  never

been more ready than it is this year——

Mr. INGLIS. I understand, but you have never mentioned the peo-
ple,  and  it  seems  to  be  a  manager’s  crucial  question  here,  if  you
take  my  theory  of  the  case,  this  may  just  be  a  personnel  matter,
is that you would mention people if you were an effective manager,
rather  than  simply  technology,  and  it  could  be  that  you  are  on  a
hobbyhorse  of  a  technology,  and  the  people  are  being  ignored,  and
perhaps,  that  is  why  the  assessment  team  made  the  recommenda-
tion they made. Is that possible?

Mr. PROENZA. They are not being ignored. Absolutely not. And in
fact, the assessment is based on our people, and I am a people per-
son,  and  I  have  a  thousand  employees,  just  under  a  thousand  em-
ployees  in  my  previous  responsibility.  And  also  in  the  Center.  I
work with professionals, and even though they may have said what
they have said, I have said also that they are all professionals, and
I don’t expect any of them to do their job at any lower performance
level  than  they  are  capable  of  doing  now.  I  really  believe  in  that,
and that is why I believe that the Center is in the best ever condi-
tion to deliver the mission to the American people this year.

Chairman MILLER. All right. We are well now past the five min-
utes, plus a very generous allowance for that interruption. Mr. Sen-
senbrenner for five minutes.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Proenza.
Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.

MORE ON MEDIA EXPOSURE

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  On  June  14,  your  supervisor,  Mary
Glackin,  gave  you  a  memo  outlining  procedures  and  expectations.
Could you please tell us who else on your staff you gave this memo
to?

Mr. PROENZA. I shared this memo with, first of all, I had a meet-
ing with my staff, and I shared what was in the memo with them.
I handed out a few copies of the memo at that time.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Did you release this memo to the press, or

leak the memo to the press in any regard?

Mr. PROENZA. No, sir.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Then, fast forward to after the assessment
team  paid  a  visit  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  Did  you  ask
your  staff  not  to  discuss  the  assessment  team  with  the  media,  the
assessment team and its investigation to the media?

Mr.  PROENZA.  I  remember  talking  to  the  investigators,  hoping
that this could all be processed in a way that it would be low key,
and not disruptive to the operations at the Center.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Later  on,  when  the  media  came  on  one  of
their  regular  calls,  did  you  bring  the  assessment  team’s  presence
and investigation up to them?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Not  that  I  remember.  I  remember  that  all  of  the
interviews that I had went through the NOAA public affairs people
that were there, and that they, indeed, knew at that time that the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

group  was  there,  investigating.  I  don’t  know  if  they  picked  it  up
while they were there, or they knew before they got there. All I did
was I conducted my interview and answered the questions.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Okay.  Now,  I  have  got  the  assessment
team’s report here, and about two-thirds of the way down, on page
3 of the report, it says: ‘‘Separately, the assessment team witnessed
similar  behavior.  In  the  Team’s  initial  meeting  with  the  Director,
he asserted he wanted the assessment to be least disruptive as pos-
sible to our operations, and to be low key. He told the Team he did
not  want  anyone  going  to  the  media,  otherwise,  that  will  engage  a
lot of explanation on our part to them. Nevertheless, the next day,
he held media interviews on the forecast operations floor about the
assessment,  while  the  hurricane  specialists  were  performing  their
duties,  analyzing  tropical  activity.’’  This  is  a  report  of  the  assess-
ment team. It is at variance with the testimony that you just gave
under oath. Which is correct?

Mr.  PROENZA.  My  testimony  is  correct.  When  they  came  in,  and
they  were  interviewing  me,  that  is  when  those  questions  came  up.
I  simply  answered  those  questions.  The  interviews  were  set  up
where  they  normally  are  set  up,  at  the  briefing  desk,  and  I  con-
ducted and answered accordingly. I did not set up those interviews.
Those  interviews  were  set  up  by  the  NOAA  public  affairs  people.
Is the question, sir——

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  The  reason  the  interviews  were  set  up  by
the  NOAA  public  affairs  people,  was  that  relating  to  the  activities
of  the  assessment  team,  or  was  that  relating  to  the  normal  oper-
ations of the Hurricane Forecasting Center?

Mr.  PROENZA.  The  person  that  came  down  with  the  Team,  Greg
Romano,  was  especially  for  the  purposes  of  monitoring  the  assess-
ment  team’s  impact  on  the  office,  and  whatever  went  on  between
NOAA  public  affairs,  the  two  people,  it  was  coordinated  among
themselves,  and  I  was  strictly  just  brought  out  to  the  floor  to  an-
swer them.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay. Then, are you saying that Dr. Turn-
er’s report, that I just quoted, is inaccurate, where he said that you
were  holding  media  interviews  on  the  forecast  operations  floor
about  the  assessment,  while  the  hurricane  specialists  were  per-
forming their duties analyzing tropical activity?

Mr. PROENZA. If I was on the forecast floor, it was the desk that
I  conduct  my  briefings  from,  and  should  questions  have  come  up
in  the  media  about  the  assessment  team,  I  would  have  answered
them at that time, but I did not in any way invite those questions.
They were set up——

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Did  it  ever  occur  to  you  that  the  word  no
comment,  words  no  comment  might  have  been  a  more  appropriate
response?

Mr. PROENZA. It did not, because I was answering honestly.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Okay.  Well,  all  I  can  say  is,  is  that  you
know,  this  is  a  personnel  problem,  which  in  my  opinion,  should
have been handled internally, rather than being tried in the news-
papers,  and  ended  up  being  elevated  to  a  Congressional  hearing.  I
don’t  think  it  is  our  job  as  Congresspeople  to  deal  with  personnel
problems.

Mr.  Proenza,  you  have  got  a  problem  down  there  that  half  your
employees  say  they  don’t  have  any  confidence  in  you,  and  if  the
NOAA  management,  and  particularly,  the  NOAA  Administrator,
didn’t  deal  with  the  fact  that  you  had  an  employee  revolt  on  your
hands,  for  whatever  reason  it  was,  I  think  that  they  could  have
been  justifiably  accused  of  being  negligent,  you  know,  to  a  ticking
time bomb that apparently has gone off.

Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  Ms.  Johnson  for  five  minutes.

Diaz-Balart for five minutes.

MORE ON DIRECTOR PROENZA’S TENURE AT THE NATIONAL

HURRICANE CENTER

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  to  see  you,
Mr. Proenza. As many of you know, I represent and live in the area
where  the  Hurricane  Center  is  located,  and  I  have  actually  gone
to—I  know  Mr.  Proenza,  and  frankly,  he  is  a  very  likable  guy.  I
have gotten to like him, but I do have some questions that I think
need to be answered.

Mr.  Proenza,  when  you  joined  the  Hurricane  Center,  and  you
said in a lateral position, so it is not like you did it for the money,
I imagine one of the reasons you did it is because, frankly, as peo-
ple  were  saying  here,  because  of  the  great  job  that  the  people  in
the  Hurricane  Center  do,  and  also,  the  important  responsibility
that they have.

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  And  obviously,  you  follow  a  group  of  very  dis-
tinguished  professionals.  Max  Mayfield,  you  mentioned,  Jerry
Jarrell, Bob Sheets, Neil Frank. Some of the people that are in the
Hurricane Center worked with a lot of these people before.

I  think  we  would  all  agree,  everybody  here  on  the  dais  and  you,
that  the  people  that  work  in  the  Hurricane  Center  like  you,  have
a  very  distinguished  track  record.  I  am  a  little  worried,  however,
when  you  answered  a  question  from  the  Chairman,  I  believe,  and
he  asked  you,  and  I  am  paraphrasing,  but  did  you  know  that  the
people  that  worked  with  you  in  the  Hurricane  Center  had  a  prob-
lem,  and  you,  in  essence,  said  I  didn’t  think  there  was  a  problem
with  the  staff.  And  then,  subsequent  to  that,  half  of  the  staff  pub-
licly  writes  a  letter  with  some  pretty  strong  statements.  If  I  may
quote: ‘‘The Center needs a new Director, and with the heart of the
hurricane  season  fast  approaching,  urges  the  Department  of  Com-
merce to make this happen as quickly as possible.’’

How  is  it  possible  to  have  almost  half  of  the  people,  including
your secretary, senior hurricane specialists, people that have an in-
credible  track  record,  how  is  it  possible  that  you  would  not  know
that  they  had  a  problem,  if  they  got  to  the  point  of,  shortly  after-
wards, going out and writing a letter, not just saying they have got
issues, but asking for you to be removed? Is that, were you discon-
nected entirely with your staff?

Mr.  PROENZA.  Congressman,  there  is  always  a  few  that  may  re-

sist some changes.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. This is half of them.
Mr. PROENZA. Let me just evolve what I would like to say.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Sure. Sure.

Mr.  PROENZA.  A  few  that  may  resist  some  changes.  I  know  that
there  were  some  that  resisted  some  of  the  graphic  changes,  some
of  the  other  changes  associated  with  the  research  community,  giv-
ing the leadership for part of the hurricane forecast research to the
Hurricane  Research  Division,  and  so  forth,  as  part  of  a  total  one
NOAA  type  of  approach,  but  nevertheless,  I  felt  that  those  were
best.

But  when  the  Team  came  in,  what  happened  with  that  letter
being  signed  was  after  the  Team  came  in.  When  the  Team  came
in, that was so extraordinarily disruptive. We had already had four
storms. We have had no problems in dealing with the four storms,
but it was extraordinarily disruptive. There was a surprise inspec-
tion.  It  was  unprecedented.  It  triggered,  because  I  heard  some  of
the  concerns,  it  triggered  a  frenzy  of  concern  for  people’s  careers
and the mission.

And  I  understand  that,  and  I  respect  their  concerns.  They  were
popped in with this investigation, and they were concerned, and of
course,  at  that  time,  after  the  investigation  was  started,  and  the
meeting  that  was  held,  that  was  called  for  by  some  of  the  leaders,
by  some  of  the  leaders  of  the  group  that  wanted  to  do  something.
That particular time is when they got the signatures together.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. But Mr. Proenza——
Mr. PROENZA. It was after the Team investigation began.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Okay. Now, again, because I have had contact
with  these,  they  were  constituents  of  mine.  They  have  contacted
me as well, and some of them have said that a group of ten of them
initiated the call——

Mr. PROENZA. Okay.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.—to  your  supervisors.  They  were  the  ones  who
initiated the calls. Now, again, that is what they said. I don’t know
if that is factual or not, but here is the question. You said you did
not know there was a problem with the staff. I don’t know, you ob-
viously  had  a  problem,  and  maybe  it  was  a  problem  with  one  or
five or ten, but you had a problem, because some of them initiated
this  letter.  But  you  said  that  you  did  not  know  there  was  a  prob-
lem.  I  mean,  it  just,  it  is  hard  to  believe  that  you  would,  did  you
not know, or did you not think it was a big enough problem?

Mr. PROENZA. Perhaps they should have come to me.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Perhaps, but let me ask you this now, because
you  have  been  a  very  successful  supervisor.  If  you,  in  one  of  your
previous  positions,  have  a  group  of  highly  respected  professionals
wrote  to  you,  and  say  our  direct  boss  has  real  problems,  and  it  is
making  our  job  impossible,  would  you  think,  would  you  have  not
done anything?

Mr. PROENZA. I would have——
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Or  would  you  have  tried  to,  in  the  best  way
possible, tried to figure out what the problem was, and maybe sent
in  a  group  of  impartial  people  to  find  out  if  there  was  a  problem?
Or  would  you  have  done  absolutely  nothing?  Because  this  is  my
problem. If you have people that you and I have both said, and ev-
erybody here respect, say that the Director of the Hurricane Center
must  go,  and  if  NOAA  would  have  not  done  anything,  if  a  group
of  highly  regarded  professionals  calls  their  supervisors,  as  they
have said they did on their own, and said our boss is a major prob-

lem, and is not allowing us to do our job, which may not have been
the  case,  but  that  call  took  place,  it  seems  like.  If  NOAA  would
have not done anything, do you think that would have been respon-
sible? And in your case, if that would have happened in your case,
would  you  have  done  nothing?  Would  that  have  been  responsible?
Mr. PROENZA. No, I would have called the Supervisor, first thing.
I  have  had  45  such  supervisors  under  my  responsibility,  and  the
first thing I would have done is called the supervisor, explain what
I  have  heard  is  a  problem,  and  explain  to  them  what  can  we  do
to  help  out.  But  I  would  have  at  least  enlisted  them  first,  to  find
out what we could do at that level first.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Now, it seems to me that——
Chairman  MILLER.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired.  We  will

have a second round of questions.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Baird for five minutes.

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  don’t  particularly  have  questions.  I  just  would  sug-
gest  that  as  the  Committee  inquires  about  this,  that  we  be  cog-
nizant  that  there  are  legal  matters  pertaining  to  employment
issues.  I  personally  asked  the  gentleman  to  yield  previously,  be-
cause  I  think  to  ask  a  supervisor  to  identify  personnel  in  a  Con-
gressional  forum  in  the  manner  that  was  asked  is  really  not  fair,
and is not respectful of his certain legal obligations, and I think we
have to respect.

However,  I  really  don’t  have  a  dog  in  the  fight,  except  that  I
think  there  is  politicization.  If  the  gentleman  is  doing  his  best  to
protect his country from hurricanes, I certainly worked in organiza-
tions,  where  sometimes,  change  is  resisted.  And  I  think  it  is  prob-
lematic  to  say  to  a  gentleman,  whichever  side  you  are  on  on  this,
would  you  identify  staff  members  on  one  side  or  the  other  in  this
public forum, and I would urge this committee to refrain from that,
out of respect not only for the gentleman here, but for the employ-
ees  themselves,  and  for  legal  issues  that  may  pertain  to  employee
hiring  and  promotion  and  other  decisions.  And  that  was  the  point
I was trying to make earlier.

Yield back.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Feeney for five minutes.

THE ROLE OF CONGRESS

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  think  the
gentleman’s  comments  are  well  taken.  I  mean,  personnel  decisions
are  always  tough.  I  was  Speaker  of  the  House,  I  had  900  employ-
ees,  and  whether  you  are  managing  two  people  or  900.  The  real
question  for  me  is  why  Congress  is  involved  in  this  one.  The  right
decision  or  wrong  decision  may  have  recently  been  made,  but  you
know,  not  long  ago,  I  sat  in  a  joint  hearing  of  the  House  Science
Committee and our corollary on the Senate side, and we had a su-
pervisor  that  was  accused  of  being  too  popular  for  his  bosses,  and
so,  we  had  to  have  a  full  joint  hearing  of  the  House  and  Senate.
Now, we have got one who is accused of being too unpopular with
some of his bosses and his employees, and so, we have got to have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

a  full  hearing.  We  have  got  admirals  and  other  leaders  waiting  in
the  background.  We  are  going  to  have  a  series  of  questions.  And
so, what Congress is going to do is to micromanage personnel deci-
sions.  We  have  had  close  to  400  investigations  in  the  first  six
months, and I guess I should have expected, coming to work today,
that I would be busy, because I am running from here to the Judi-
ciary Committee, where we are fighting with the White House over
personnel  decisions.  And  so,  as  Congress,  535  of  us,  try  to  micro-
manage  decisions  that  the  Administration  make,  as  we  are  trying
to  micromanage,  in  some  cases,  the  war,  it  is  useful  to  remember
why we have a chief executive. Somebody has to call the runner out
or safe at home base, and you can’t have 15 umpires. You have got
to  have  one,  and  the  President  of  the  United  States  has  to  make
this decision.

And with all due respect, like Congressman Diaz-Balart said, you
may  have  been  the  greatest  supervisor  in  the  world,  and  maybe
just bad luck, bad timing, wrong place, wrong time, personality dif-
ferences, for whatever reason, we have half your employees calling
for  your  removal  because  of  lack  of  confidence.  It  may  not  be  your
fault. They may have exercised misjudgment.

Secondly, we have got your supervisor saying that in order to re-
store  confidence  in  the  TPC,  that  we  need  to  have  your  removal,
and  finally,  we  have  an  independent  investigative  body  saying  the
same  thing.  And  it  may  not  be  fair  at  all  to  you,  sometimes,  life
isn’t  fair,  but  nobody  has  a  right  to  a  job,  especially  when  it  is  an
appointment by the President of the United States.

MORE ON QUIKSCAT

One of the big things that seems to have generated this dispute,
other  than  personal  issues  and  interpersonal  skills,  and  who  is
mad at whom, is the question over QuikSCAT, and you have made
statements  to  the  press  recently  that  suggest  that  without  a  very
rapid  replacement  of  QuikSCAT,  essentially,  our  ability  to  track
and  forecast  hurricane  paths  may  be  undermined.  That  is  one  of
the things that people claim they are concerned about. As recently
as May 22, you were quoted at a NOAA news conference as saying:
‘‘I am encouraged in those conversations that we have had, and dis-
cussions  we  have  had,  that  the  Nation  will  be  moving  ahead  very
constructively 
in  coming  up  with  a  design  next-generation
QuikSCAT  to  replace  the  current,  which  is  still  operational
QuikSCAT that we have at this time.’’

You  just  told  this  committee  that  we  are  more  prepared  than
ever to track hurricanes. The dispersal of information gathering ca-
pabilities  is  much  greater  than  when  we  started  with  QuikSCAT.
For example, aircraft reconnaissance, you started your career. Con-
gressman Diaz-Balart and I recently crawled into one of the NOAA
Hurricane  Hunters,  so  you  are  very  familiar  with  the,  every  year,
we  are  getting  better  with  that  sort  of  equipment,  observations
from  ocean  buoys,  ships,  Caribbean  islands.  We  have  got  a  Euro-
pean  satellite,  and  in  fact,  NOAA  is  now  investigating  ways  that
we can get the necessary information.

So,  maybe  your  press  skills  aren’t  the  best.  Lord  knows,  I  have
made  my  mistakes  with  the  press,  but  for  whatever  reason,  there
is a great difference of opinion amongst the experts of how we need

ties.

to  replace  the  capabilities  of  QuikSCAT,  and  some  of  your  recent
comments  have  generated  concern  that  we  have  undermined  the
ability to protect Americans with the best information, and if I had
to  suggest  one  thing  that  probably  has  led  to  this  whole  scenario,
it  is  the  fact  that  you  have  made  statements,  your  staff  has  tried
to  either  correct  you  or  change  those  statements,  and  I  will  allow
you to respond to that, but I would just tell you, in my view, there
is  only  one  umpire.  That  decision  has  been  made.  I  think  it  has
been verified. It may not be your fault, but you are out.

And  with  that,  I  will  let  you  respond  to  the  QuikSCAT  capabili-

Mr. PROENZA. Thank you, Congressman.
First of all, on the QuikSCAT program, the statement I made on
May the 22nd, that I was greatly encouraged, was based on Conrad
Lautenbacher, Administrator of NOAA, saying to the press that in-
deed, that particular project was gaining in the priorities at NOAA,
and  was  rising  in  its  priority  level,  and  I  was  encouraged  to  hear
that. And I also know that we were starting to have a preliminary
meeting  with  the  NASA  people,  the  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory,  on
the concept of how a new instrument would be designed, and again,
I  was  encouraged.  When  you  mention  the  aircraft  data  is  valuable
to  us.  It  is  essential  for  us.  We  use  it  operationally  all  the  time,
when we have a system.

QuikSCAT  is  quite  different,  in  that  that  type  of  data,  we  need
QuikSCAT,  too.  It  gives  us  the  wind  direction,  the  wind  speed,  at
the surface, but it gives us an 1,800 kilometer-wide swath of infor-
mation  across  the  ocean,  and  it  covers  90  percent  of  the  global
oceans. It is a key piece of data force.

Thank you, Congressman.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Klein.

DIRECTOR PROENZA’S COMMENTS ON QUIKSCAT

Mr.  KLEIN.  Mr.  Ehlers  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  if  he

wants to go first.

Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  actually,  I  think  in  the  ordinary  rota-

tion of Majority and Minority. Mr. Ehlers, do you care?

Mr.  KLEIN.  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-
man.  First  of  all,  thank  you  for  being  here  today,  and  I  think  the
public  is  tired  of  hearing  about  the  debate.  I  think  the  public  is
much more interested in making sure that public safety is number
one. Those of us who live in Florida or any other part of the coun-
try where hurricanes are a factor, and we have lived through some
pretty  substantial  disasters  and  loss  of  life  and  property,  and  we
know  that  this  Hurricane  Center  is  very  much  an  important  part
of how we plan and deal with the preparation.

So,  what  was  refreshing  to  me  all  along  was  the  fact  that  you
brought  something  up,  and  it  was  a  question  of  let  us  look  into  it.
Again, I don’t personally feel qualified to determine whether or not,
you  know,  you  should  be  the  manager  or  not.  I  think  that  if  there
is  a  question,  that  needs  to  be  looked  into.  I  think  this  process  is
fine,  and  let  it  play  itself  out,  and  I  think  none  of  us  support  or
endorse  the  idea  of  politicization  of  any  kind  of  job.  There  is  a  job
to  be  done,  and  this  is  not  any  kind  of  insignificant  job.  This  is  a
very important public safety job.

Specifically,  my  question  is  this.  When  I  went  to  the  Hurricane
Center,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  I  was  there  one  of  the  days  Congress-
man  Diaz-Balart  was  down  there,  I  had  the  chance  to  talk  to  the
hurricane  forecasters,  and  to  see  QuikSCAT  and  how  it  is  used.  I
was  told  by  the  forecasters  that,  they  showed  me  exactly  how  the
data  is  presented,  that  it  is  one  of  many  tools.  It  is  not  the  entire
tool. It is one of many tools that allows them to give a better fore-
cast,  allows  them  to  shape  the  cone.  We  all  know  what  that  cone
looks  like,  and  how  we  prepare  for  it.  It  allows  them  to  establish,
hopefully, a timing element that is better, and knowing when land-
fall is met, and I saw that.

I  read,  since  then,  a  number  of  comments  that  have  come  from
different  people,  Rick  Knabb  at  the  Hurricane  Center,  which  said
when QuikSCAT, it will be like going back six years in tropical cy-
clone  analysis.  Other  people  in  other  positions  have  said  the  same
thing, and I guess my question is why is it that some of these peo-
ple have retracted or retrenched or backed off on some of their com-
ments? I look at these people as professionals. These are scientists.
These  are  career  experts,  and  just  tell  me,  you  know,  what  your
sense  of  that  is.  I  understand  you  stand  by  your  positions,  and  I
just want to make sure that you still are in that same position, and
you  still  feel  that  QuikSCAT  is  an  important  part  of  the  data  that
is presented to the analysts.

Mr. PROENZA. Absolutely. It is an important part of the data that
is  presented  for  the  analysis  of  tropical  oceans,  over  the  tropical
oceans, no question about it. It is data that we vitally look at, and
we  need  to  perform  our  jobs.  We  have  found  a  way  that  we  can
mitigate,  temporarily,  while  QuikSCAT  is  designed,  a  new  genera-
tion is designed. But at the same time, it does not equal the quality
of QuikSCAT.

Why  people  may  change  their  minds,  it  could  be  any  number  of
things.  It  could  be  their  perspective  on  an  issue  might  have
changed,  evolved.  I  would  rather  give  them  the  benefit  of  the
doubt, and say that they went through an evolution in their think-
ing, even if they were in the scientific arena, and it happened.

FUTURE OF QUIKSCAT

Mr.  KLEIN.  And  if  QuikSCAT  were  to,  and  again,  its  beyond  its
useful  life,  we  all  understand  what  that  means,  it  could  last  an-
other few years.

Mr. PROENZA. Yes.
Mr.  KLEIN.  It  could  last  another  week,  and  since  we  are  in  the
middle  of  the  hurricane  season,  the  question  I  have  been  asking
and writing and orally all along to you and your managers is, what
is  plan  B,  and  I  was  told  that  obviously,  we  are  trying  to  upgrade
the  hurricane  trackers,  which  I  support.  There  is  a  European  sat-
ellite  that  everybody  has  acknowledged  that  that  doesn’t  provide
the same level of precise, high definition data.

Mr. PROENZA. Correct.
Mr.  KLEIN.  Would  you  comment,  tell  me  what  is  the  difference,
if  QuikSCAT  goes  down,  what  is  the  difference  in  the  amount,  the
quantity and quality of data, that we will have to work with?

Mr.  PROENZA.  For  example,  in  the  QuikSCAT  data,  we  are  get-
ting  an  1,800  kilometer  swath  of  information.  That  is  down  to  a

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

41

12.5  to  25  kilometer  resolution.  That  means  that  often  we  will  get
a  point  where  we  get  that  type  of  data  coming  in  to  us.  On  the
other  hand,  the  ASCAT,  and  we  will  just  use  that  comparison  to
the coverage, the ASCAT has got two swaths of data that are about
just over 500 kilometers wide, and then, it has got a 700 kilometer
opening  in  the  middle,  where  it  has  no  data.  So,  the  data  is  quite
interrupted, and it is not as consistent, and not as relevant to what
we need.

Mr.  KLEIN.  So,  for  the  layperson,  understanding  what  the  tech-
nical  description  you  are  giving  us,  what  does  that  mean  in  terms
of  a  forecast,  for 
information  presented?  If
QuikSCAT is unavailable, and we have the European satellite and
the  buoys  and  other  things  out  there,  how  does  this  translate  into
the  accuracy,  the  timing,  the  cone,  all  those  kinds  of  things  that
we are all paying attention to?

looking  at  the 

Mr. PROENZA. The data is not as good, and accordingly, the anal-
ysis that we have will not be as good. A measure of that difference,
the one study that I can remember, and we will have a QuikSCAT
expert  coming  up  here  that  you  may  ask  that  question  of,  but  the
way  I  understand  it,  that  if  we  subtract  the  QuikSCAT  data  from
the  models  that  were  run  back  in  2003,  just  to  use  some  compari-
son,  and  see  what  the  model  forecast,  with  and  without  the  data,
that  we  could  see  some  degradation  in  the  outcome  of  the  model.
I  think  it  would  be  best  to  ask  the  expert  from  that  standpoint.
I  stand  on  my  position  that  QuikSCAT  is  a  vitally  important  tool
for the analysis over the tropical oceans and the rest of the oceans,
for  forecasting  waves  and  warnings,  winds,  and  at  the  same  time,
in analyzing tropical storm potential.

Mr.  KLEIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  what  I  would  take  from  all  that  is
that  I  think  part  of  the  process  of  what  our  committee  should  be
doing  and  the  Committees  of  Congress,  is  considering  what  the
backup plans are, make sure we are supporting backup plans, and
thinking short-term and long-term in this process.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr.  Ehlers,  you  are

recognized for five minutes.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I agree with
Mr.  Sensenbrenner’s  earlier  comments,  that  we  should  not  be  in-
volving ourselves in a personnel issue. There are procedures within
the administrative bench to handle this. We can provide our input,
but I think we should shift the emphasis away from the personnel
aspects.

I  think  what  we  should,  as  a  Science  Committee,  concern  our-
selves  with  is  the  science  involved,  and  particularly,  on  the  issue
of  QuikSCAT,  but  much  beyond  that,  and  to  the  whole  picture  of
the weather satellite program that we have. I am a scientist. I can
assure you that every scientist I know wants the maximum amount
of data, and wants the data to be as good as possible. And I under-
stand your desire to that. At the same time, I have some disagree-
ment  with  your  statement  that  the  data  from  QuikSCAT  is  both
important  and  vital.  I  would  agree  it  is  important.  I  do  not  agree
that  it  is  vital.  I  think  there  are  other  ways  of  getting—from  my
limited knowledge, I think there are other ways of getting the data
that are necessary. And perhaps not as good, but I just don’t think
the  QuikSCAT  is  vital,  but  we  should  be  concentrating  our  efforts

on developing better alternatives to QuikSCAT, and do that quick-
ly.

And I am also very disappointed, and have been disappointed for
some  time,  with  the  difficulty  we  have  had  with  the  NPOESS  sat-
ellite program at NOAA, with the huge cost overruns, and we have
spent  endless  hours  trying  to  straighten  that  mess  out.  We  got  it
back  on  track,  but  the  price  we  paid  was  to  give  up  some  of  the
sensors on NPOESS, one of which would have provided some of the
data that QuikSCAT provides, and might have done it even better.
I argued against removing those sensors. I felt we should, if nec-
essary, slow the project down a year or two, in order to get the ad-
ditional  money  to  put  the  other  sensors  back  on.  I  lost  that  battle,
and  I  think  if  I  had  won,  we  might  have  had  a  better  handle  on
the data sooner than we are going to have now. Whether or not we
need  to  replace  QuikSCAT  is  another  issue.  If  we  do,  I  certainly
hope  that  we  do  not  simply  run  out  and  have  another  QuikSCAT
put up there. All the technology has improved. We can certainly do
much  better  than  what  we  have  done  in  the  past,  and  even  if  it
takes  a  few  more  years  to  get  it  done,  I  think  it  is  worth  doing
that.

But  I  really  think,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  responsibility  of  this
committee  has  to  be  a  detailed  review  of  the  entire  weather  sat-
ellite  program,  and  establishing  good  priorities  for  us,  as  to  where
the  money  should  go.  I  am  also  concerned  that  we  are  not  putting
much money into that, when you consider the amount of money the
Federal  Government  is  putting  into  military  satellites  of  various
types,  is  putting  into  the  GPS  system,  is  putting  into  the  Shuttle
Program and so forth, I think we have given short shrift to NOAA
and  to  the  weather  satellite  program.  When,  I  just  think,  if  you
look  at  the  cost  of  one  Katrina,  that  is  far  greater  than  the  cost
of the satellites that we need to help predict things better, and help
to prevent things.

So, Mr. Chairman, that is the end of my speech. I don’t have any
questions  for  you,  Mr.  Proenza,  but  I  do  think  we  should  con-
centrate  on  the  science,  not  on  the  personality  aspects,  certainly
not on the personalities involved. And I would ask, Mr. Chairman,
that  we  have  a  complete  review  of  our  weather  satellite  program.
We have not done it justice in the past, and we have to do a better
job.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.
Ehlers. We will recognize, we will go for our second round of ques-
tioning at this point, and I will recognize——

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Chairman, may I ask, do we really need a second
round?  We  have  got  Admiral  Lautenbacher  waiting,  and  I  think
that we have heard quite a bit. It seems to me that there is no real
value in an additional round here. Couldn’t we go right on to Admi-
ral Lautenbacher?

Chairman MILLER. I am not sure everybody will.

Chairman MILLER. I have some questions I would like to ask.
Mr.  INGLIS.  Will  you  be  around  later  to  hear  from  Admiral

Chairman MILLER. I will.
Mr.  INGLIS.  Okay.  Will  everybody  be  around?  I  hope  so,  because

Mr. INGLIS.—need the other side of the story.
Chairman MILLER. But I will be, and I have more questions that

I want to ask.

DIRECTOR PROENZA’S HISTORY

Chairman LAMPSON. I recognize myself for five minutes.
Mr. Proenza, I have a series of questions.
Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Here  in  only  five  minutes,  so  please,  short.
Yes  or  nos  will  be  fine.  We  will  be  able  to  get  through  this  hope-
fully quickly.

Did  you  apply  or  seek,  in  any  manner,  the  position  of  Director

of the Hurricane Center?

Mr. PROENZA. No.
Chairman LAMPSON. I understand it was D.L. Johnson who first

approached you about the possibility of your taking the position.

Mr. PROENZA. Yes.
Chairman LAMPSON. Who offered you the position, and when was

Mr. PROENZA. Conrad Lautenbacher, December 1, 2006.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  you  began  as  Director  of  the  Center

that made?

when?

Mr.  PROENZA.  I  entered  on  duty  on  January  the  3rd.  I  was  put
on  paper  as  the  Hurricane  Center  Director  on  the  7th  of  January.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  understand  that  although  the  position
Hurricane  Director  is  high  profile  and  prestigious,  it  is  technically
a  demotion,  as  compared  to  your  position  as  head  of  the  Southern
Regional Office. Is that correct?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  also  understand  that  your  position  as
Southern Region Director attached to a position on the NOAA Cor-
porate Board. Is that correct?

Mr. PROENZA. Correct.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Accepting  your  current  position  means  you

are no longer on the Corporate Board. Is that correct?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Did  you  ruffle  any  feathers  during  your

time on the Board?

Mr.  PROENZA.  I  held  positions  that  I  thought  were  important  to

the delivery of the mission to the American people.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  am  going  to  take  that  as  a  yes.  I  under-
stand  the  NOAA  Corporate  Board  is  a  venue  where  NOAA-wide
policies  are  established,  and  decisions  are  made  about  the  oper-
ation of the line offices, budgets, et cetera. Right?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.

CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS PLAN

Chairman LAMPSON. NOAA was considering a change in the way
the  local  Weather  Service  offices  were  structured  and  worked  to-
gether,  the  so-called  concept  of  operations  plan.  CONOPS.  Were
you a supporter of that plan?

Mr. PROENZA. No.

Board?

Board.

Chairman LAMPSON. Who were the advocates for the plan on the

Mr.  PROENZA.  The  leadership,  the  very  high  leadership  on  the

Chairman LAMPSON. And that would include D.L. Johnson?
Mr. PROENZA. That is correct.
Chairman LAMPSON. Did you believe NOAA leadership supported

the CONOPS plan?

Mr. PROENZA. A mixed bag. Some support and not support.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mostly, more a yes than no.
Mr. PROENZA. More yes than no, absolutely.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  So,  some  people  might  see  your  departure
from  the  Corporate  Board  as,  shall  we  say,  a  positive  step  toward
more harmony and tranquility on the Corporate Board? Yes?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  This  committee,  I  am  pleased  to  say,  was
instrumental  in  halting  the  plan.  We  had  a  GAO  team  investigate
and  assess  the  plan  for  several  years,  and  they  produced  two  re-
ports.  The  second  one  was  released  last  month.  They  weren’t  very
impressed  with  the  planning  effort,  and  the  Admiral  has  told  us
that  the  plan  has  been  abandoned.  Would  you  tell  me  some  about
that plan, please?

Mr. PROENZA. The concept of operation?
Chairman LAMPSON. Yes.
Mr.  PROENZA.  Looked  at  the  idea  of  trying  to  assign  responsibil-
ities  at  certain  times  to  adjoining  office,  and  allowing  some  of  the
forecast  offices  around  the  country  to  shut  down,  to  be  less  than
24/7 operations.

Chairman LAMPSON. And they closed it for that reason?
Mr.  PROENZA.  They  would  close,  because  the  adjoining  office
would  be  able  to  pick  up  the  responsibility.  The  concern  was  that
emergency management would not be served on a 24 hour by seven
basis. In addition to that, there was concern that we could not open
up an office as fast as would be needed to apply the local expertise
of  that  particular  county  warning  area,  to  the  issue  that  might
have developed overnight.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Proenza.  I  will  now  recog-

nize Chairman Miller for five minutes.

CRITICISMS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF THE NATIONAL

HURRICANE CENTER

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It certainly is not the role of these two subcommittees to look at
personnel  decisions,  personnel  matters.  This  appears  to  be  some-
thing  that  goes  beyond,  well  beyond  office  politics.  The  question
that I raised in my opening statement. I found out in the same way
most  Americans  found  out  about  this  controversy,  by  watching  the
news  a  couple  of  weeks  ago.  These  subcommittees  had  nothing  to
do with this issue coming up in the national news. But when there
is  an  explosion  like  what  we  saw  a  couple  weeks  ago,  it  certainly
is  appropriate  for  this  subcommittee  to  find  out  what  has  been
going on, what on Earth happened.

One  unchallenged  assumption  in  a  lot  of  the  questioning  has
been,  and  I  don’t  want  to  ruffle  your  feathers,  or  those  who  work

at the Center, has been that this Center does the best work. I have
talked  to  research  scientists,  I  don’t  want  to  name  names  in  this
setting. Mr. Baird would call me down for that. But the assumption
that  the  forecasts  of  the  Hurricane  Center  are  really,  really  good,
are the best, is not what they say at all. In fact, they say the fore-
casts  are  so  bad,  particularly  forecasts  of  inland  flooding,  and  the
vast  majority  of  people  who  die  now  from  hurricanes  die  from  in-
land  flooding.  The  forecasts  of  intensification,  whether  hurricanes
are  going  to  strengthen  or  weaken,  those  are  really  bad.  Virtually
every  research  university  in  the  country  that  does  atmospheric  re-
search, that does meteorological research, disregards the Hurricane
Center’s forecasts. They take the raw data, they run their own fore-
casts with their own models, which are always better, always more
accurate.

So,  I  am  not  sure  that  I  think  it  is  a  bad  thing  that  someone
come into that Center and look at whether that Center is doing as
good  a  job  as  it  should,  and  whether  it  is  using  the  best  science
that  it  should  be  doing.  Mr.  Proenza,  have  you  heard  those  criti-
cisms that I just repeated?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  PROENZA.  And  it  was  my  objective  to  address  those.  The
growing  challenges  of  the  future,  as  far  as  the  population  centers,
and the growing populations along the coastline, was an absolutely
compelling  argument  why  we  had  to  get  more  accurate  at  fore-
casting intensity changes. I needed to bring all of the forecast capa-
bilities  together  with  the  research  capabilities  of  our  organization
and  the  academic  community  together  to  address  that.  Absolutely.
In fact, intensity forecasts had shown very little improvement over
many years.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. Your efforts to try to bring together, to
try to meld research and operations, is that, were those efforts ad-
dressed to get at the failings of the forecasts of the Hurricane Cen-
ter?

Mr. PROENZA. Yes, sir. We were trying.
Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  I  think,  by  comparison  to  FEMA,  yes,
the  Hurricane  Center  is  top  notch.  If  we  compare  it  to  the  kind  of
emergency  management  in  Katrina,  at  least  we  knew  there  was  a
hurricane  coming,  but  from  all  that  I  have  heard  from  people  who
know  this  stuff  know,  the  work  of  the  Hurricane  Center  is  not  as
good  as  it  should  be.  It  could  be  better  right  now,  if  it  paid  closer
attention  to  the  science,  the  best  science  that  is  out  there,  and  re-
search  universities  all  across  the  country  are  doing  better  fore-
casting than the Hurricane Center.

Mr. PROENZA. And yes, Congressman, but I have to say we have
to bring the very best science and tools to the Hurricane Center for
them  to  get  better  at  what  they  do.  They  are  top  notch  group  of
professionals  doing  the  best  job  they  can  with  the  information  and
the tools that they have.

Chairman  MILLER.  Mr.  Inglis,  would  you  like  to  ask  a  question

or a comment? You are recognized for five minutes.

Mr. INGLIS. I won’t use that, except to respond to Mr. Miller that
as  I  understand  it,  the  Hurricane  Forecasting  Center  accurately

predicted Katrina’s path, and gave warnings three days in advance
of that storm hitting New Orleans. Pretty impressive work.

Mr. PROENZA. Absolutely, sir.
Mr. INGLIS. By very dedicated people.
Mr. PROENZA. Top notch.
Mr.  INGLIS.  That  work  very  hard  to  accomplish  the  objectives  of
the  American  people.  I  have  no  further  questions,  Mr.  Chairman.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Diaz-Balart, you are recognized.

HURRICANE CENTER PERSONNEL

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  first  want  to
thank  Mr.  Klein,  Congressman  Klein,  for  trying  to  get  us  focused
on the one thing that we do do in this committee, which is science,
and not personnel.

Look, it is pretty obvious that despite what I just heard from Mr.
Miller  that  the  Hurricane  Center  is  horrible,  and  I  beg  to  differ.
And  I  don’t  know  how  many  times  he  has  been  there,  by  the  way,
maybe  many,  and  maybe  he  has  met  the  incredible  men  and
women  in  the  Hurricane  Center  that  Mr.  Proenza  says  are  incred-
ible, and that I know are incredible. So, I just, despite that, I think
everybody here is well-intentioned. I think Mr. Proenza is a decent,
good, professional guy with a great track record.

Nobody can claim that he doesn’t have a great track record, and
I think the people in the Hurricane Center are the same thing. Un-
fortunately, and I don’t want to, pardon the pun, but unfortunately,
Mr. Proenza has become the lightning rod, from within the staff in
the Hurricane Center and others. And that is unfortunate, and that
has created a problem. I don’t think Mr. Proenza is at fault. I don’t
think  the  people  at  the  Hurricane  Center  are  at  fault.  Sometimes,
these  things  happen,  and  it  is  unfortunate.  Unfortunately,  it  has
created a problem.

Now, we shouldn’t be talking about personnel here, because Con-
gress  doesn’t  do  personnel,  and  even  if  we  decided  that  Mr.
Proenza is the person to be there, we can’t really do anything about
it  anyway,  so  we  are  kind  of  just  talking  for  the  sake  of  talking.
So, I do want to get back to, as Mr. Klein said, the science.

HURRICANE CENTER SCIENCE AND QUIKSCAT

And  I  do  have  one  piece  of  good  news  for  Congressman  Klein.  A
number  of  us,  including  Chairman  Lampson,  Rep.  Melancon,  and
myself,  met  with  the  Admiral,  met  with  the  NASA  Administrator,
Mr.  Griffin.  Specifically  about  this  satellite  issue,  and,  because  we
were  concerned  that  there  was  no  plan.  And  I  can’t  speak  for  the
other two gentlemen, but I can speak for myself. I am not satisfied
that  it  has  taken  this  long  to  come  up  with  a  decision  as  to  what
has  to  go  up,  but  I  think  we  are  all,  at  least  I  was  satisfied,  that
at  least  there  is  a  plan  to,  and  I  guess  by  January,  they  are  sup-
posed to get back us, Mr. Chairman. They are supposed to get back
to  NOAA  and  NASA  and  everybody  else  as  to  what  exactly  is  the
right  satellite  that  has  to  go  up,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  we
have  not  only  QuikSCAT  but  actually,  a  much  better  version  of  it.
So,  and  by  the  way,  I  think  Mr.  Proenza  has  got  to  be  given  a
lot of credit for bringing up this issue, whether you agree with him

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

that  it  is  less  important  or  more  important,  the  reality,  however,
is  that  now,  at  least,  there  is  a  plan,  and  I  feel  good  about  that.
And I think that is what we, frankly, need to be talking about, be-
cause  we  keep  talking  about  personnel  issues,  and  the  reality  is,
you know, are we going to have, then, the 20 plus people that don’t
like  Mr.  Proenza  for  good  reasons  or  bad,  and  the  20  plus  people
that do like Mr. Proenza for good reason or bad, to come and testify
as well?

You  know,  we  are  kind  of  getting  a  little  trivial  here.  Those  are
important issues. I think we need to get into the science, and when
we get into the science, I think there are much better questions to
ask, and I wish we would kind of focus on that.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. PROENZA. Thank you, Congressman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Diaz-Balart. I recognize Mr.

Klein.

Mr. KLEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  listen,  there  is  a  reason,  in  my  view,  for  Congress  to  have
oversight,  and  make  sure  there  is  accountability  in  our  systems,
and  sometimes,  appointments  are  good,  and  sometimes,  they  are
not.  We  all  don’t  like,  the  public  doesn’t  like  cover-ups.  The  public
does  like  when  someone  is  straightforward  and  open  and  honest,
and brings something forward.

You know, what happens from this point on is going to play itself
out,  but  most  importantly,  what  I  appreciate  is  Mr.  Proenza’s
bringing this issue forward. And I can’t address what happened in-
side  the  office  there,  but  I  really  believe  that  this  Congress  today,
and the meetings that you have had, and the meetings I have had
with  the  Air  Force  Reserve  and  with  the  NOAA  representatives,
and  forcing  people  to  come  forward,  and  say  what  is  plan  B,  be-
cause America wants to know what plan B is.

If QuikSCAT goes down, and it is even 10 percent of the informa-
tion that is provided for hurricane forecasting, that is real informa-
tion. And Mr. Ehlers said it correctly, scientists want to know that
they have got everything on the table to figure that out.

I  will  tell  you  also,  I  participated  in  the  Senate  hearing  on
QuikSCAT about a couple weeks ago, that Senator Nelson and oth-
ers  participated  in,  and  another  fact  that  we  haven’t  even  brought
up  today,  is  there  is  no  question  whatsoever  that  QuikSCAT  has
everything  to  do  with  marine  forecasting.  Nobody  has  even  ques-
tioned  that.  So,  if  you  have  got  large  vessels,  small  vessels,  any-
where  around  the  world,  the  fact  that,  you  know,  the  service  that
gets this information, QuikSCAT, is providing valuable information
to our shipping, our recreational, all the safety factors that go into
commerce  and  safety  of  individuals  on  the  water,  QuikSCAT  has
a  big  role.  So,  even  if  people  are  questioning  whether  it  has  the
same  level  of  impact  on  landfall,  there  is  no  question  that  on  the
marine side, it does have a big impact.

So, there is a reason to have this conversation. There is definitely
a  reason  to  make  sure  that  our  colleagues  at  NOAA  and  the  Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center  have  the  tools,  that  they  are  doing  what-
ever they can do to make sure that we are properly protected, and
I  do  give  credit  for  this  conversation  coming  forward  to  this  point,
and  that  we  stay  on  top  of  this,  as  has  been  suggested  by  all  the

Members  of  this  committee,  to  make  sure  that  we  understand  the
total  comprehensive  picture  on  our  weather  satellites  and,  of
course,  QuikSCAT,  and  anything  else  that  gives  us  this  data  to
help best prepare Americans for any kind of——

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Will the gentleman yield for a few seconds?
Mr. KLEIN. Yes, sir.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you. I just want to make sure that, be-
cause  you  have  been  in  the  Hurricane  Center,  like  I  have,  and  I
just  want  to  make  sure  that  we  don’t  scare  the  American  people.
I think you would agree with me that they do an incredible job. Ob-
viously, we need to do everything we can in our power, so that they
have  all  the  technology  and  the  funding,  but  I  just  want  to  make
sure that we don’t scare the American people, because I have heard
some things here today on this dais. Mr. Miller, I think said some-
thing which I think was unfortunate. I think you would agree with
me that they do a heck of a job, and they are really good, dedicated
people that are good at what they do.

Mr.  KLEIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  can  respond.  The  answer  is,  of
course.  The  personnel  are  highly  qualified  scientists.  The  question
that we are grappling with today is making sure that they have all
the tools necessary to get us even better.

I think Mr. Miller’s point is well taken. Can they do better? Can
that cone get narrower? Can the prediction of the landfall get tight-
er? You bet, and we have made progress over time. But we can do
more,  and  we  should  do  more.  That  doesn’t  mean  America  should
be  concerned  today  that  we  don’t  have  the  necessary  good  people
in  place  that  are  doing  it,  but  this  Congress  needs  to  back  up  the
National  Weather  Service  and  the  Hurricane  Center,  and  make
sure that they have got what they need to best protect Americans.
Chairman MILLER. I think we are going to thank you very much,

Mr. Proenza——

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ROBERT  M.  ATLAS,  DIRECTOR,  ATLANTIC
OCEANOGRAPHIC  AND  METEOROLOGICAL  LABORATORY,
OFFICE  OF  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  RESEARCH,  NA-
TIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION,
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Dr.  ATLAS.  Chairman  Lampson,  Chairman  Miller,  and  Members
of the Committee, as mentioned, I am Bob Atlas. I am the Director
of  NOAA’s  Atlantic  Oceanographic  and  Meteorological  Laboratory
in Miami.

At  my  laboratory,  we  do  open  ocean  and  coastal  ocean  research.
We  do  research  on  climate,  and  we  have  as  one  of  our  divisions,
within  my  laboratory,  the  Hurricane  Research  Division  of  NOAA.
Prior  to  joining  NOAA,  I  was  a  NASA  scientist  for  32  years.  I
have  helped  pioneer  many  of  the  satellite  systems  that  are  in  use
today,  and  one  of  them  being  QuikSCAT,  but  many  others,  and  I
was a member of the team that developed QuikSCAT, and am still
a  member  of  the  team  working  on  the  future  of  such  measure-
ments.

The QuikSCAT, as mentioned, is a NASA satellite. It is the third
in  a  string  of  satellites  that  do  ocean  surface  wind,  direction  and
speed.  The  first  satellite  lasted  three  months.  The  second  satellite
lasted  10  months,  and  QuikSCAT  has  been  there  now  for  over
seven  years.  It  is  a  major  success,  not  only  in  its  longevity,  but  in
the  quality  of  the  data  that  it  produces  under  most  atmospheric
conditions, and also, in the amount of data that it provides.

Its  advantages  are  that  it  has  higher  resolution  than  any  of  the
other  datasets  available.  The  normal  resolution  is  12.5  kilometers
between  observations.  This  is  twice  as  good  as  the  European
ASCAT  and  twice  as  good  as  any  of  the  preceding  satellites.  And
it is capable, under research conditions, or limited operations, to do
even  double  that  resolution,  6.5  kilometers.  It  also  has  disadvan-
tages.  The  disadvantage  is  that  it  does  not  see  very  well  through
heavy  rain,  so  in  heavy  rain  situations,  especially  where  the  wind
isn’t  strong,  it  cannot  predict  wind  direction  accurately,  and  the

50

data  is  not  as  high  quality  in  heavy  rain,  high  wind  situations,
such as exist within hurricanes.

QuikSCAT  is  used  for  many  applications.  It  is  used  in  research
of  the  atmosphere,  ocean,  and  climate.  It  is  now  considered  an  es-
sential  climate  monitoring  dataset.  It  is  used  for  ocean  prediction,
for driving ocean models, and it is used in both numerical weather
prediction  and  operational  prediction.  I  want  to  say  first  about
operational  prediction  and  the  Ocean  Prediction  Center  of  NOAA,
the  Ocean  Prediction  Center  of  NOAA  forecasts  for  ships  at  sea
and other maritime interests.

I  asked  forecasters  at  the  Ocean  Prediction  Center  if  they  are
using  QuikSCAT  many  years  ago,  and  they  said  we  depend  upon
it. I said how would you rate it. They said it was the most valuable
dataset  they  had.  I  heard  that  from  three  forecasters  of  the  Ocean
Prediction  Center,  and  I  also  heard  from  them  that  they  believe
this data is contributing to saving lives, that ships, some ships are
not  sinking  in  bad  weather,  and  some  sailors  are  not  drowning  in
bad weather, because we have these kinds of measurements.

For hurricane prediction, it is used directly by the forecasters at
the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  and—slash—National  Hurricane
Center, and its primary use is for tropical analysis. It enables them
to  define  what  we  call  the  wind  radii,  the  aerial  extent  of  tropical
storm  force  winds.  This  is  a  very  useful  application  of  the  data.  It
also  will  sometimes  show  that  a  storm,  a  tropical  depression,  has
formed.  It  will  show  the  circulation  within  the  winds,  on  occasion,
before geostationary satellites show it in the clouds.

So,  from  those  two  perspectives,  it  is  an  extremely  valuable  in-
strument, but it is only one of the tools that the Hurricane Center
forecasters use. They have heavy reliance upon the reconnaissance
aircraft,  and  upon  ground-based  radar,  ships’  buoys,  and  the  nu-
merical  models.  And  the  numerical  models  is  the  other  use  of
QuikSCAT  that  affects  hurricane  forecasts,  and  in  fact,  forecasts
everywhere on the globe.

There  are  three  studies  defining  what  the  impact  of  QuikSCAT
is,  one  by  the  Joint  Center  for  Satellite  Data  Assimilation,1 which
showed  a  10  percent  degradation  at  48  hours,  and  a  16  percent
degradation  at  72  hours,  if  this  data  wasn’t  there.  This  study  is  a
rigorous, scientifically correct study. It is limited in its sample size.
There is a Navy study that has conflicting results, and the authors
of  that  study  have  stated  that  it  applies  only  to  the  Navy  model,
and in fact, the Navy model does not use QuikSCAT as effectively,
because they do something, and they create what is called a bogus
or synthetic hurricane vortex within their analysis. The QuikSCAT
then  has  to  compete  with  that  data,  and  it  is  not  able  to  make  as
much of an impact.

To  sum  up,  QuikSCAT  is  an  extremely  important  tool.  We  need
not another clone of QuikSCAT, but we need a next generation sys-
tem  that  will  enable  us  to  make  the  improvements  to  hurricane
prediction that the Nation deserves, and NOAA is working actively
to pursue both a follow-on to QuikSCAT and has an effective miti-
gation plan now to deal with a possible demise of QuikSCAT.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT M. ATLAS

Introduction

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  Dr.  Robert  Atlas,  Director
of  the  Atlantic  Oceanographic  and  Meteorological  Laboratory  in  the  Office  of  Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Research (OAR). OAR is a line office of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, within the Department of Commerce (DOC).
NOAA’s  Atlantic  Oceanographic  and  Meteorological  Laboratory,  Hurricane

Research Division

NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) is located
in  Miami,  Florida  and  specializes  in  hurricanes  and  open  and  coastal  ocean  re-
search.  Scientists  at  AOML  study  the  relationship  between  the  ocean  and  atmos-
phere by conducting research in both near-shore and open ocean environments. This
research  includes  the  dynamics  of  the  ocean,  its  interaction  with  the  atmosphere,
and  its  role  in  climate  change.  AOML’s  research  improves  the  understanding  and
prediction  of  hurricane  track  and  intensity  change,  and  the  impacts  from  wind,
storm  surge,  waves,  and  rain.  Key  to  this  work  is  the  annual  hurricane  field  pro-
gram  supported  by  the  NOAA  Aircraft  Operations  Center  research/reconnaissance
aircraft.  AOML  scientists  cooperate  with  other  federal,  State,  and  local  authorities
to  maximize  research  expertise  for  use  in  economically  and  environmentally  impor-
tant  projects.  AOML  also  provides  and  interprets  oceanographic  data  collected  via
ships,  satellites,  aircraft,  drifting  buoys  and  floats,  and  conducts  research  relevant
to annual-to-decadal climate change, coastal ecosystems and hurricanes.

Within  the  Hurricane  Research  Division  (HRD)  at  AOML,  scientists  conduct  re-
search  into  hurricanes  and  related  tropical  weather  phenomena,  using  theoretical
studies, computer models, and an annual field program employing NOAA hurricane
research  aircraft.  This  research  has  resulted  in  a  deeper,  scientific  understanding
and  in  numerous  practical  applications  which  have  improved  forecasts.  HRD  em-
ploys  meteorologists,  computer  scientists,  and  other  professionals,  who  collaborate
with  other  governmental  and  academic  scientists  worldwide  in  this  on  going  effort
to advanced scientific knowledge and increase public safety. HRD coordinates parts
of its programs with other NOAA organizations, e.g., the Aircraft Operations Center
and  the  National  Centers  for  Environmental  Prediction,  in  particular  the  Environ-
mental  Modeling  Center  and  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center/National  Hurricane
Center (NHC).
NOAA’s Hurricane Forecasting

NOAA  strives  to  improve  the  reliability,  accuracy,  and  timeliness  of  our  pre-
dictions  of  hazardous  weather,  such  as  hurricanes,  to  help  society  cope  with  these
high impact events. Over the last 15 years, hurricane track forecast errors have de-
creased by 50 percent, largely due to advances in hurricane modeling, an increased
understanding  of  hurricane  dynamics,  improvements  in  computing  and  technology,
and  increased  observations  in  both  the  region  around  the  hurricane  and  in  other
data  sparse  regions.  Today’s  five-day  forecasts  of  a  hurricane  track  are  as  accurate
as  three-day  predictions  were  20  years  ago.  Hurricane  predictions  are  better  today
than they have ever been and will continue to improve in the future.

To  help  guide  future  research  efforts  and  improvements,  NOAA  requested  that
the  NOAA  Science  Advisory  Board  commission  a  Hurricane  Intensity  Research
Working Group to provide recommendations to the agency on the direction of hurri-
cane intensity research. The Working Group transmitted its final report to the Advi-
sory  Board  in  October  2006  (http://www.sab.noaa.gov/reports/reports.html).  The
Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Supporting  Research  released
a  report  in  February  2007,  Interagency  Strategic  Research  Plan  for  Tropical  Cy-
clones: The Way Ahead, to provide a strategy for continuing to improve the effective-
ness  of  operational  forecasts  and  warnings  through  strategic  coordination  and  in-
creased collaboration among the major players in the operational and R&D commu-
nities  (http://www.ofcm.gov/p36-isrtc/fcm-p36.htm).  Both  of  these  reports  call  for
accelerated research investments and a deliberate focus on moving research results
to  operations.  In  response,  NOAA  has  created  a  Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement
Project Team to develop a unified approach to define and accelerate hurricane fore-
cast  improvements  over  the  next  ten  years.  Objectives  will  be  focused  on  improved
tropical  cyclone  forecasting  (intensity,  track,  precipitation,  and  uncertainty  fore-
casts),  storm  surge  forecasts,  flooding  forecasts,  and  information  and  tools  to  sup-
port community and emergency planning.
NOAA Hurricane Observations

Before  I  talk  about  the  QuikSCAT  satellite,  I  wanted  to  explain  the  systems
NOAA uses to monitor hurricanes. Over the open oceans, continual images from our

GOES satellites are the first reliable indicators of any storms or inclement weather.
GOES  provides  near  real-time  critical  data  to  help  our  forecasters  determine  a
storms location, size, intensity, and movement. These satellites are so important we
keep  a  spare  in  orbit.  As  tropical  systems  come  closer  to  land,  information  from
NOAA and Department of Defense (DOD) aircraft and ocean buoys provide real time
direct  measurements  of  the  storm.  Within  200  miles  of  the  coast,  ground-based  ra-
dars are used to track the storm. Computer models used to predict storm track and
intensity  require  extensive  amounts  of  data,  which  are  mostly  provided  by  NOAA
and  various  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  DOD  polar
satellites,  and  where  appropriate  foreign  environmental  satellites.  Together  these
systems  provide  the  forecasters  with  layers  of  information  critical  to  helping  them
make their forecast.
What is QuikSCAT?

QuikSCAT  is  a  NASA  satellite  that  has  demonstrated  the  ability  to  measure
ocean wind speed and direction from space with unprecedented coverage. QuikSCAT
data  is  used  for  many  applications,  including  climate  monitoring,  ocean  research
and  weather  prediction.  It  can  be  used  to  produce  improved  forecasts  of  hurricanes
in three ways: its direct use by forecasters, its use as initial conditions for numerical
weather prediction models, and its use as validation data in the development of ad-
vanced ‘‘next generation’’ weather prediction models. According to the forecasters at
the  National  Hurricane  Center,  ‘‘QuikSCAT  has  become  an  important  tool,  espe-
cially for estimating the track, intensity and size of tropical and other strong marine
storms.’’ In most cases, however, QuikSCAT has little demonstrated impact on hur-
ricane  intensity  forecasts.  In  hurricanes,  winds  above  75  miles  per  hour  typically
occur over an area that is smaller than the QuikSCAT measurement resolution and
are  usually  associated  with  heavy  rain  events.  Thus  QuikSCAT  usually  cannot  dis-
tinguish winds above 75 miles per hour in a hurricane due to its lower than desired
resolution  and  signal  attenuation  in  heavy  rain.  However,  QuikSCAT  can  distin-
guish  winds  above  90  miles  per  hour  in  extra-tropical  cyclones  where  strong  winds
exist over larger regions of the ocean surface. In addition, until very recently, most
numerical models did not have sufficient resolution to represent key processes lead-
ing to rapid intensity changes or the ability to assimilate much of the detailed infor-
mation contained in the QuikSCAT observations.

QuikSCAT is well past its design life. NASA says QuikSCAT appears healthy and
has fuel to last until 2011. It is not possible to predict how long QuikSCAT will con-
tinue  to  provide  data.  It  could  last  several  more  years  or  cease  to  provide  observa-
tions very quickly.

There are three studies that address the potential degradation to computer hurri-
cane  forecasts  that  might  result  from  the  loss  of  QuikSCAT.  Each  of  these  studies
has limitations that prevent definitive conclusions, and additional studies are need-
ed.  In  my  opinion,  the  preponderance  of  evidence  from  the  three  studies  indicates
that  computer  model  forecasts  of  landfalling  hurricanes,  especially  in  the  2–5-day
time range, could be degraded if we do not mitigate the loss effectively. Forecasters
at  the  NHC  are  able  to  improve  upon  the  computer  forecasts,  so  that  the  potential
degradation  can  be  diminished.  This  is  especially  true  as  the  storms  are  approach-
ing  land  in  the  shorter  time  ranges.  In  addition,  NOAA  has  recently  developed  an
effective mitigation plan that would make substantial use of other satellites as well
as enhanced aircraft observations.
What are the options to replace QuikSCAT data?

If  QuikSCAT  were  to  fail  today,  the  NHC  would  still  receive  ocean  wind  speed
and direction data from space. NOAA is now receiving data from a new instrument
aboard  a  European  satellite,  called  ASCAT—which  has  similar  technology  to
QuikSCAT. ASCAT will not provide the same quality data as QuikSCAT, especially
in  terms  of  coverage  and  resolution.  NOAA  is  rapidly  developing  procedures  for  in-
serting  the  data  into  models  and  using  the  visual  display  of  these  data  in  fore-
casting. We are also examining how to increase the use of our hurricane hunter air-
craft through more flight hours and outfitting the planes with more advanced tech-
nologies. In addition, we are researching the feasibility of placing scatterometers on
Unmanned Aircraft Systems.

In  June  2006,  NOAA  held  a  workshop  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center  to  dis-
cuss the requirements for ocean wind speed and direction. Hurricane forecasters, re-
searchers,  and  numerical  modelers  all  prefer  a  next  generation  QuikSCAT,  which
they  hope  would  be  able  to  meet  the  new  requirements.  Such  a  satellite  would  be
able to provide observations of ocean surface wind that would greatly enhance ocean
surface  wind  measurements  for  hurricane  intensity  forecasting,  as  well  as  for
weather,  ocean  and  climate  applications.  In  January  2007,  Vice  Admiral

53

Lautenbacher,  the  head  of  NOAA,  was  briefed  on  the  conclusions  of  the  workshop
and the need to replace QuikSCAT data. After receiving our fiscal year 2007 appro-
priations,  NOAA  initiated  a  study  with  NASA’s  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory,  which
built the original QuikSCAT, to examine replacement options. Those studies are due
in January 2008 and from these studies, we will determine the best way to provide
ocean surface wind speed and direction to forecasters.
Details on QuikSCAT
1. We now believe that the quality of ocean surface vector wind retrievals in storms
at  sea  using  any  passive  sensor  (such  as  WindSat,  or  the  Microwave  Imager/
Sounder on the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Sys-
tem (NPOESS) ) will never be comparable to those retrieved using an active sen-
sor such as QuikSCAT. NPOESS will not provide an acceptable solution for ocean
surface  vector  winds  retrievals,  but  it  will  provide  many  other  types  of  useful
data and imagery.

2. QuikSCAT has provided many benefits but also has significant limitations. While
it  provides  important  additional  data  for  estimating  the  intensity  and  size  of
tropical storms and other strong marine storms, it cannot be used for measuring
the intensity of most hurricanes.

3. Data from any non-satellite platform could never replicate the coverage provided
by  a  satellite.  Therefore,  no  non-satellite  option  exists  to  replace  QuikSCAT  for
wide-area  measurements  of  ocean  surface  vector  winds.  Satellites  are  com-
plementary  to  other  data  sources,  such  as  aircraft  and  buoys,  which  have  their
own strengths and limitations. Satellites, aircraft, and surface-based observations
are  all  critical  components  of  the  Nation’s  weather  monitoring  and  forecasting
enterprise.

4. Data  from  the  European  ASCAT  satellite  instrument  are  just  now  becoming
available  to  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  forecasters.  ASCAT  is  not  a  re-
placement for QuikSCAT, since it provides only about 60 percent of the coverage
and only about half the resolution of QuikSCAT. It will, however, provide partial
mitigation  against  the  eventual  loss  of  QuikSCAT,  and  it  will  be  fully  evaluated
for maximum possible use by NWS operational forecasters and models.

5. Since  even  QuikSCAT  data  do  not  meet  NOAA  operational  requirements  for
ocean surface vector winds, serious consideration should be given to a sustained,
more  capable,  next-generation  satellite  program  for  ocean  surface  vector  winds
using  already  existing  technologies.  A  next-generation  capability  is  needed  to
more  accurately  measure  the  strength  and  size  of  hurricanes  and  other  intense
marine  storms,  since  aircraft  data  are  not  always  available  and  only  cover  a
small  portion  of  the  storm  circulation.  Such  a  capability  would  enhance  oper-
ational  NWS  forecasts  of  many  weather  systems  for  the  United  States,  and  it
would  benefit  research  on  the  intensity  of  hurricanes  and  other  marine  storms
that occur worldwide.

6. NOAA and NASA are working together during the next several months to exam-
ine  the  costs  and  benefits  of  options  for  what  kind  of  satellite  should  replace
QuikSCAT: a QuikSCAT copy, or a next-generation sensor. NOAA and NASA en-
gineers will work directly with NWS operational forecasters during this study to
provide recommendations by early 2008 on next steps for an ocean surface vector
winds mission to replace QuikSCAT.

7. Track forecasts for landfalling storms have the added benefit of the national and
international rawinsonde network (sensors to obtain detailed atmospheric profiles
of  wind,  temperature,  and  dewpoint  information),  and  from  aircraft  reconnais-
sance  flights  into  and  around  the  approaching  hurricane.  With  these  data,  if
QuikSCAT would fail, the impact on the track forecasts of hurricanes as they ap-
proach  land  would  on  average  be  smaller  than  for  forecasts  for  storms  in  the
open  ocean.  Studies  on  landfalling  storms  are  insufficient  to  quantify  the  im-
pacts. However, available experiments show that observations far away from the
location of hurricanes can have a significant impact on model track forecasts. As
such,  NOAA’s  mitigation  plan  will  attempt  to  minimize  any  degradation  that
might otherwise occur.

Current Research Studies of QuikSCAT in Models

Studies have shown either negligible or slightly positive impacts of QuikSCAT ob-
servations  on  track.  The  major  drawback  of  these  studies  is  the  small  number  of
cases  examined.  A  more  systematic  study  using  cases  from  a  number  of  seasons

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

should be performed to clarify the impact. To date there are no studies of the impact
of QuikSCAT data on tropical cyclone intensity forecasts. The main problem is that
until  this  season  models  that  forecast  tropical  cyclone  intensity  relied  only  upon
coarse resolution global data assimilation system for their initial conditions. The im-
pact on intensity must be tested in the future using very high resolution global and
regional models, where inner core observations can be assimilated.

One  study  using  the  NOAA  global  data  assimilation  system  and  global  forecast
system tested the impact of QuikSCAT on track forecasts from two months of Atlan-
tic  storms  in  2003  (Zapotocny  et  al.,  2007).  The  study,  conducted  at  the  NOAA/
NASA/DOD  Joint  Center  for  Satellite  Data  Assimilation,  examined  storms  in  Au-
gust-September 2003 and showed that a degradation in the 48 hour track forecasts
of  10  percent  and  in  the  72  hour  track  forecast  of  16  percent  when  QuikSCAT  was
removed.  A  drawback  of  this  study  was  the  number  of  cases  (only  25  cases  at  48
hours and 19 cases at 72 hours). Nevertheless, this study provides the best available
estimate  of  the  degradation  of  model  track  forecasts  that  might  result  from  a
QuikSCAT failure.

A second study used the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System
and  data  assimilation  system  from  two  months  in  the  2004  Atlantic  hurricane  sea-
son  (Goerss  and  Hogan,  2006).  This  study,  using  8–10  times  as  many  cases  as  the
previous  one,  found  little  significant  improvement  in  the  track  forecasts  due  to  the
inclusion  of  QuikSCAT  observations  of  ocean  surface  vector  winds  beyond  that  at
24 hours, which showed a three percent improvement (two percent improvement at
48  hours,  and  slight  degradation  at  72–120  hours.  In  my  opinion,  the  impact  of
QuikSCAT  data  in  this  experiment  was  limited  by  the  way  in  which  the  data  was
assimilated,  and  the  results  should  apply  only  the  Navy  model  used  in  the  experi-
ment.

A  third  study  by  NASA  and  NOAA  (Atlas  et  al.,  2005)  using  the  NCEP  forecast
system for two months of forecasts in 1999 showed a meaningful positive impact of
QuikSCAT.  In  one  case  (Hurricane  Cindy,  1999)  the  60-hour  forecast  intensity  and
location with QuikSCAT observations of ocean surface vector winds was more accu-
rate than the 24-hour forecast without them. This study should be considered in the
context of two decades of numerical experiments with NASA models that have con-
sistently  shown  improved  predictions  of  storms  over  the  oceans  (Atlas  et  al.,  2001).
In  summary,  QuikSCAT  provides  vital  data  for  a  variety  of  important  applica-
tions,  including  weather  prediction  for  ships  at  sea,  hurricane  forecasting,  atmos-
pheric and oceanic research, and climate monitoring. NOAA has developed an effec-
tive mitigation plan that should reduce the impact of a QuikSCAT failure on hurri-
cane forecasting while working with NASA to evaluate an advanced replacement for
QuikSCAT.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBERT M. ATLAS

Dr.  Robert  Atlas  is  the  former  Chief  Meteorologist  at  NASA’s  Goddard  Space
Flight Center (GSFC), and is currently the Director of the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Lab-
oratory in Miami, Fla. Some of the areas he focuses his current research on include
the  prediction,  movement  and  strengthening  of  hurricanes.  Atlas  has  worked  with
both satellite data and computer models as a means to study these hurricane behav-
iors.  He  is  also  recognized  world-wide  as  an  expert  on  satellite  surface  wind  data

and performed the original research that demonstrated the use of these data to im-
prove weather prediction.

Robert  Atlas  received  his  Ph.D.  in  Meteorology  and  Oceanography  in  1976  from
New  York  University.  Prior  to  receiving  the  doctorate,  he  was  a  weather  forecaster
in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  where  he  maintained  greater  than  95  percent  forecast  accu-
racy.  He  was  also  a  summer  intern  at  the  National  Center  for  Atmospheric  Re-
search  (NCAR)  and  an  instructor  of  physics  for  the  State  University  of  New  York
(SUNY).

From  1976  to  1978,  Dr.  Atlas  was  a  National  Research  Council  Research  Asso-
ciate  at  NASA’s  Goddard  Institute  for  Space  Studies,  New  York,  an  Assistant  Pro-
fessor  of  Atmospheric  and  Oceanic  Science  for  SUNY  and  Chief  Consulting  Mete-
orologist for the ABC television network.

In 1978, Dr. Atlas joined NASA as a research scientist. He served as head of the
NASA  Data  Assimilation  Office  from  1998–2003,  and  as  Chief  meteorologist  at
NASA  GSFC  from  2003–2005.  During  this  time,  he  was  also  an  Adjunct  Professor
of  meteorology,  teaching  weather  prediction  to  both  experienced  and  inexperienced
weather forecasters.

Dr.  Atlas  has  performed  research  to  assess  and  improve  the  impact  of  satellite
temperature  sounding  and  wind  data  since  1973.  He  was  the  first  person  to  dem-
onstrate  the  beneficial  impact  of  quantitative  satellite  data  on  weather  prediction,
for both satellite temperature soundings and satellite surface winds.

He served as a member of the Satellite Surface Stress Working Group, the NASA
Scatterometer  (NSCAT)  Science  Team,  the  ERS  Science  Team,  the  SeaWinds  Sat-
ellite Team and the Working Group for Space-based Laser Winds. He is also a mem-
ber  of  the  Scientific  Steering  Group  for  GEWEX  (the  Global  Energy  and  Water
Cycle  Experiment),  Chairman  of  the  U.S.  World  Ocean  Circulation  Experiment
(WOCE) Advisory Group for model-based air-sea fluxes, and is a past member of the
Council of the American Meteorological Society.

From 1974–1976, he developed a global upper-ocean model and studied oceanic re-
sponse  to  atmospheric  wind  forcing  as  well  as  large-scale  atmospheric  response  to
sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (unusual events). In more recent years, his
research  concentrated  on  the  role  of  how  the  air  and  sea  interacts  in  the  develop-
ment of cyclones, the role of soil moisture and unusual SST events in the initiation,
maintenance and decay of prolonged heat waves and drought, and most recently on
the  modeling  and  prediction  of  hurricane  formation,  movement  and  intensification.
Atlas  was  one  of  the  principal  investigators  of  a  new  hurricane  computer  model
called the ‘‘Finite Volume General Circulation Model’’ (fvGCM), being run at NASA’s
GSFC  and  Ames  Research  Center,  Moffitt  Field,  Calif.  The  model  provides  a  more
realistic  representation  of  hurricanes  and  their  behaviors,  which  is  enhancing  the
state of hurricane forecasting.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Dr. Atlas. Mr. McKinnon, please

proceed for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF MR. DONALD L. MCKINNON, DIRECTOR, JONES
COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, LAUREL, MIS-
SISSIPPI
Mr.  MCKINNON.  Chairman  Lampson,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking
Member  Inglis,  and  Ranking  Member  Sensenbrenner,  and  distin-
guished  Members  of  the  Subcommittees,  thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity to come before you today to provide testimony regarding the
service  provided  by  the  National  Weather  Service’s  Southern  Re-
gion during Mr. Proenza’s tenure.

I  am  Don  McKinnon,  Director  of  the  Jones  County  Emergency
Management  Agency  in  Laurel,  Mississippi.  I  am  representing  the
Mississippi Civil Defense and Emergency Management Association,
which  has  300  members  across  all  82  counties  of  the  State  of  Mis-
sissippi.  I  have  worked  in  the  Emergency  Management  Agency  in
Jones County for 26 years. I have been the Director since 2001.

Current,  accurate,  and  timely  weather  information  plays  a  sig-
nificant  role  in  all  weather  events,  as  well  as  other  incidents.  The
accessibility and the willingness of the National Weather Service to

56

help  emergency  management  are  critical  in  our  incident  action
plans, as we prepare for and respond to these incidents.

Over the past six years, I have had the opportunity to work with
the Southern Region Director, Mr. Bill Proenza, on many occasions.
At  conferences  and  other  meetings,  Mr.  Proenza  would  always  so-
licit  comments  from  the  emergency  managers,  and  took  their  con-
cerns to heart. Mr. Proenza convinced me that the National Weath-
er Service could be more than a reactive weather source, and could,
in fact, be a proactive weather resource in the emergency manage-
ment community.

Mr.  Proenza  encouraged  the  local  weather  offices  to  involve
emergency  managers  in  their  outreach  activities.  He  fostered  an
environment  within  the  Southern  Region  that  allowed  his  per-
sonnel to work with and meet the needs of the customers that they
served.  Mississippi  emergency  managers  could  give  you  many  ex-
amples  of  how  Mr.  Proenza  made  a  difference  in  their  ability  to
protect  their  citizens.  I  have  listed  a  few  in  my  written  statement.
The  Warning  Coordinating  Meteorologist  in  San  Angelo,  Texas
came  up  with  the  Turn  Around,  Don’t  Drown  Program.  Mr.
Proenza  recognized  the  benefit  the  program  could  have  on  saving
lives, and brought the program to the emergency management com-
munity. Once he sold the emergency managers on the program, he
promoted  it  across  the  United  States.  The  National  Weather  Serv-
ice  office  in  Jackson,  Mississippi  partnered  with  the  Mississippi
Civil  Defense  and  Emergency  Management  Association  to  develop
an  eight-hour  training  course  geared  toward  the  emergency  man-
agement community that included the National Weather Service of-
fices  in  Slidell,  Louisiana,  Memphis,  Tennessee,  and  Mobile,  Ala-
bama. Now, the training is offered annually and available to emer-
gency management and the media.

Without  Mr.  Proenza  to  institute  changes  and  growth  in  the
Southern  Region,  we  may  not  have  had  the  Radar  Integrated  Dis-
play  and  Geospatial  Elements,  or  RIDGE  System,  which  provides
area-specific  warning  information  in  the  form  of  graphic  polygons
and text messages. This allows emergency management to focus on
specific  areas  of  the  county,  and  makes  our  decision-making  proc-
ess much quicker and more reliable. Now, we do not have to make
broad advisories, but we can focus on a specified area. Mr. Proenza
recognized  our  need,  and  worked  with  his  staff  to  get  us  a  better
tool. The end result is saving lives and property.

Many  counties  in  the  State  were  plagued  by  inefficient  coverage
by  the  National  Weather  Service  Doppler  radar  system.  Simply
stated, it did not cover the counties the way it was designed to, due
to  elevation  and  geographical  location.  Mr.  Proenza  was  aware  of
this  problem,  and  worked  constantly  to  correct  it.  Thanks  to  his
support  and  tenacity  in  getting  the  radar  moved,  we  now  have  a
more reliable Doppler radar covering our counties.

Recently, NOAA was considering the concept of operations, which
would have resulted in lowering National Weather Service field of-
fice  staffing  and  hours  of  operation  of  some  field  offices.  Mr.
Proenza defended the much-needed local presence of full-time serv-
ice, and stood with local emergency managers to question this dan-
gerous concept. We are concerned that Mr. Proenza’s defending the

57

interests of the public safety and the emergency management com-
munity may have brought retribution on him.

Mr. Proenza is a dedicated servant of the American people. If you
are  uncomfortable  with  straight,  honest,  truthful  answers  to  the
hard  questions,  then  don’t  ask  Mr.  Proenza  the  question,  because
that is what you are going to get, the truth.

When  I  learned  that  Mr.  Proenza  had  been  appointed  the  Direc-
tor  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  I  was  extremely  happy,  and
at  the  same  time,  I  was  sorry  to  see  him  leave  managing  the
Southern Region. We hoped he would have the opportunity to bring
the  same  innovative  approaches  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center
that we came to expect when he managed the Southern Region.

Mr.  Proenza  is  an  advocate  for  the  people  he  serves,  and  when
he  encounters  problems,  he  faces  them  head-on.  If  it  is  broken,  he
wants  it  repaired.  If  it  is  working  correctly,  he  wants  it  improved.
In my dealings with Mr. Proenza, he has never been one to sit back
and  watch  things  happen.  He  has  always  been  on  the  forefront
making  things  happen.  Sadly,  it  seems  that  he  made  the  mistake
of trying to improve the National Hurricane Center.

Thank you for the opportunity to appear today, and I will be glad

to answer any questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. McKinnon follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DONALD L. MCKINNON

Chairman  Lampson,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  Ranking  Member
Sensenbrenner,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Subcommittees,  I  thank  you  for
the opportunity to come before you today to provide testimony regarding the service
provided  by  the  National  Weather  Service’s  Southern  Regional  Office  during  Mr.
Bill Proenza’s tenure.

I am Don McKinnon, Director of the Jones County Emergency Management Agen-
cy,  Laurel,  Mississippi.  I  am  representing  the  Mississippi  Civil  Defense  and  Emer-
gency  Management  Association  (MCDEMA),  which  has  300  members  from  all  82
counties in Mississippi. Since 2000 the State of Mississippi has had 11 Presidential
Disaster Declarations, nine Small Business Administration (SBA) Disaster Declara-
tions and 19 Governor State of Emergencies. I have worked in the emergency man-
agement agency in Jones County for approximately 26 years. I have been the Direc-
tor  since  2001.  Emergency  Management  is  a  coordinating  agency  responsible  for
maintaining  emergency  plans,  preparedness,  response,  disaster  exercises,  recovery,
and  mitigation  projects.  We  work  with  all  public  safety  agencies,  local,  State,  and
federal,  as  well  as  volunteer  and  non-emergency  agencies.  One  of  our  primary  mis-
sions  is  to  prepare  for  and  respond  to  weather-related  events.  We  in  Jones  County
are  no  strangers  to  tornadoes,  floods  and  hurricanes.  I  am  responsible  for  respond-
ing  to  all  of  them.  We  also  have  incidents  that  are  not  caused  by  weather  that  we
rely  on  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  to  assist  us  with.  For  example,  chem-
ical  spills,  hazardous  shipment  accidents,  bridge  collapse,  fire,  search  and  rescue,
etc.  Current,  accurate,  and  timely  weather  information  plays  a  significant  role  in
each  of  these  incidents.  The  accessibility  and  the  willingness  of  the  NWS  to  help
emergency  management  are  critical  in  our  Incident  Action  Plans  as  we  prepare  for
and respond to these incidents.

Jones  County,  Mississippi,  is  located  approximately  100  miles  inland  from  the
Mississippi  Gulf  Coast.  When  Hurricane  Katrina  slammed  into  Mississippi  on  Au-
gust  29,  2005,  we  suffered  everything  the  Gulf  Coast  suffered  except  the  storm
surge.  We  had  130  +  mph  sustained  winds  with  gusts  much  greater.  We  had  250
homes  destroyed,  650  homes  with  major  damage  and  several  thousand  homes  with
minor damage. We suffered seven Hurricane Katrina-related deaths. Remember we
are 100 miles inland from the coast.

Over  the  past  six  years  in  my  tenure  as  the  Emergency  Management  Director  I
have  had  the  opportunity  to  work  with  the  Southeastern  Regional  Director  of  the
National  Weather  Service  Mr.  Bill  Proenza  on  many  occasions.  I  first  met  Mr.
Proenza  at  a  Mississippi  Civil  Defense  Emergency  Management  Association  con-
ference.  Mr.  Proenza  was  speaking  to  the  conference  attendees  on  the  importance
of the National Weather Service and the Emergency Management Community work-

58

ing  together  to  achieve  more  success  in  warning  our  citizens  of  impending  weather
events. Mr. Proenza was passionate about his topic and would later meet with con-
ference  attendees  to  network  individually  and  continue  his  discussion.  Mr.  Proenza
would  always  solicit  comments  from  the  local  emergency  managers  and  took  their
concerns  to  heart.  Mr.  Proenza  convinced  me  that  the  NWS  could  be  more  than  a
reactive  weather  source  and  could,  in  fact,  serve  as  a  proactive  weather  resource
working with the emergency management community.

Not  only  did  Mr.  Proenza  come  to  us,  he  asked  us  to  come  to  him.  Mr.  Proenza
encouraged the local weather offices to involve emergency management in their out-
reach  activities.  The  National  Weather  Service  Office  in  Jackson,  Mississippi,
partnered  with  the  Mississippi  Civil  Defense  Emergency  Management  Association
to develop an eight hour training course geared toward the emergency management
community  and  the  interaction  with  the  NWS.  Then  the  NWS  offices  from  Slidell,
LA, Memphis, TN, and Mobile, AL were invited to attend so the emergency manage-
ment  customers  they  serve  could  interact  with  them.  Some  of  the  topics  included
understanding the Doppler Radar, understanding the products produced and offered
by the NWS and tracking specific events that had occurred. Now the training is of-
fered annually and available to emergency management and the media. Mr. Proenza
recognized  that  there  are,  aside  from  the  general  public,  two  core  customers,  emer-
gency management and the media, that needed personal and daily interaction with
the National Weather Service. He fostered an environment within the Southeastern
Regional  NWS  that  allowed  his  personnel  to  work  with  and  meet  the  needs  of  the
customers they served.

Mr. Proenza was deeply involved in the development of the NWS Southern Region
program  ‘‘Turn  Around,  Don’t  Drown.’’  Flooding  is  the  number  one  cause  of  drown-
ing deaths in the United States. Realizing that the National Weather Service could
do more to educate the public on what they should and should not do during a flood
Mr. Proenza solicited information from the NWS Offices in his region. The Warning
Coordination  Meteorologist  in  San  Angelo,  TX  came  up  with  the  ‘‘Turn  Around,
Don’t Drown’’ theme. Mr. Proenza recognized the benefit the program could have on
saving  lives  and  brought  the  program  to  the  emergency  management  community.
Once  he  sold  the  EMs  on  the  program  he  promoted  the  program  across  the  United
States. The next time you hear that slogan, remember where it came from. Without
Mr. Proenza we would not have it.

Not one to just continue a practice because ‘‘that is the way we have always done
it,’’  Mr.  Proenza  encouraged  the  NWS  Southern  Region  Headquarters  Staff  to  de-
velop a computer program that would give a graphic display of severe weather infor-
mation on the NWS Radar sites on the Internet. Users could already see the weath-
er  cells  or  lines  moving  into  their  areas  but  when  a  watch  or  warning  was  issued
that information was not visible on the Internet site. Mr. Proenza knew that emer-
gency management and the public needed more and that’s what he gave them. Now
when  a  flood,  storm  or  tornado  watch  or  warning  is  issued  they  get  a  graphic  box
showing the area affected simultaneously with the weather on the NWS Radar page
of  the  Internet.  Not  only  do  you  get  visual  representation,  if  you  click  on  a  county/
parish  in  the  box  you  get  the  text  message  associated  with  the  watch  or  warning.
You  will  know  the  program  as  Radar  Integrated  Display  with  Geospatial  Elements
or RIDGE. Without Mr. Proenza to institute changes and growth in the NWS South-
ern  Region  we  may  not  have  the  RIDGE  System.  What  we  had,  worked.  Mr.
Proenza  knew  that  it  could  work  better  and  provide  more  useful  information  to  a
public  who  needed  it.  That’s  what  we  have  because  Mr.  Proenza  would  accept  no
less.

Mr. Proenza was contacted in 2004 by a local emergency management director in
a small rural county about a problem with the NOAA weather radio system in their
area.  This  is  a  county  with  a  population  of  approximately  22,000  people.  Mr.
Proenza  met  with  the  local  officials  and  listened  as  they  explained  their  concerns.
Mr.  Proenza  then  went  to  work  for  them.  In  late  2005  the  county  received  equip-
ment to replace the defunct system. The County now has a working NOAA weather
radio system and the citizens of Carthage, Mississippi, can rest easier knowing that
they  will  get  timely  weather  information  that  may  save  their  lives.  I  later  learned
that Mr. Proenza had repeated this process in several other counties in Mississippi.
Not only did he follow through with the equipment that he promised, he personally
followed  up  on  the  resolution  of  the  problems  to  ensure  that  the  systems  were  per-
forming as they should and nothing else was needed. Mr. Proenza was instrumental
in making these systems functional.

Problems  are  plentiful  in  the  emergency  management  business.  Mr.  Proenza  is
not  afraid  to  face  these  problems  with  us  when  they  concern  the  National  Weather
Service.  Jones  County  as  well  as  many  other  counties  in  the  state  was  plagued  by
inefficient coverage by the new (1993) NWS Jackson Doppler Radar system. Simply

stated, it did not cover my county the way it was designed to. In defense of the NWS
it  was  designed  to  give  full  coverage  to  the  NWS  Jackson  coverage  area  of  which
my  county  is  a  part.  But  when  construction  was  started  on  the  site,  the  Federal
Aviation Administration notified the NWS Jackson office that the tower housing the
radar  would  have  to  be  lowered  by  10  meters  (30  feet)  because  of  the  proximity  to
the  Jackson  International  Airport.  Having  no  alternative  site  the  construction  had
to proceed. From day one the radar coverage was degraded by approximately 50 per-
cent in the eastern part of the state. This was because of a terrain issue. What did
this mean to the radar coverage? It meant that the forecasters could not accurately
monitor  rain  data  and  wind  data  below  six  to  eight  thousand  feet.  Unless  a  storm
was  well  above  six  to  eight  thousand  feet  then  the  forecasters  could  possibly  miss
it,  as  was  the  case  in  November  of  2001  in  Jones  County.  A  small  tornado  touched
down  in  west  Jones  County  at  approximately  7:20  P.M.  and  destroyed  several
homes.  The  West  Jones  High  School  and  Middle  School  received  major  damage.
NWS  officials  came  to  Jones  County  the  next  day  and  explained  that  they  simply
did  not  see  the  storm.  Mr.  Proenza  was  aware  of  the  Doppler  Radar  problem  and
was  working  to  correct  it.  He  kept  me  updated.  The  emergency  management  com-
munity wrote many letters of support in this push to get the radar moved to a more
suitable  location.  Finally  the  radar  was  moved  in  2002  to  a  site  in  Rankin  County,
Mississippi,  approximately  seven  miles  from  the  original  site.  Coverage  has  im-
proved tremendously and we have not had any ‘‘surprises’’ since the move. Without
Mr.  Proenza’s  support  and  tenacity  we  may  not  have  achieved  the  move.  He  made
it happen and my citizens are safer because of it.

Mr.  Proenza  asked  for  my  input  on  an  issue  concerning  the  National  Weather
Service  name  and  logo  a  number  of  years  ago.  NOAA  wanted  to  change  the  name
and  the  logo  of  the  National  Weather  Service  to  the  NOAA  Weather  Service.  This
came  as  a  surprise  to  me  and  quite  honestly  I  was  baffled  by  the  proposed  change.
The  NWS  is  a  national  brand  name.  It  is  trusted  and  credible  with  a  history  going
back  over  130  years.  The  logo  represents  quality  and  knowledge  in  the  weather
service.  To  change  the  name  for  no  more  reason  than  to  just  change  the  name
doesn’t make sense to me. I understand that this is still an issue.

More  recently  Mr.  Proenza  asked  me  to  represent  the  emergency  management
community  in  the  interview  process  to  replace  the  retiring  NWS  Jackson  Warning
Coordination Meteorologist (WCM). I had worked with the outgoing WCM for many
years  and  had  grown  to  trust  and  respect  his  opinion.  Finding  a  suitable  replace-
ment  was  going  to  be  a  challenge.  We  found  a  very  capable  applicant.  Before  the
applicant  was  approved  for  the  position  Mr.  Proenza  called  me  to  make  sure  I  was
comfortable with the applicant and that this person would be a good fit in our emer-
gency  management  programs.  I  am  happy  to  report  that  the  new  WCM  has  been
well received by emergency management and has brought with him many new and
useful ideas. Mr. Proenza did not have to include the emergency management com-
munity  in  this  process.  However,  he  recognized  the  importance  of  this  position  to
emergency  management  and  took  the  step  to  include  us  in  selecting  the  person  we
would be working so closely with.

Recently  NOAA  was  considering  a  ‘‘concept  of  operations’’  which  would  have  re-
sulted in lowering NWS field office staffing and hours of operation of some field of-
fices. Mr. Proenza defended the much-needed local presence of full time service and
stood with local emergency managers to question this dangerous concept. I know my
meteorologists and they know me. They know where Jones County is and what the
terrain  is  like  here.  We  work  together  to  inform  and  protect  the  public.  The  mete-
orologists  in  NWS  Jackson,  Mississippi,  treat  Jones  County  as  more  than  a  statis-
tical  spot  on  a  map.  We  were  grateful  that  as  a  result  of  questions  raised  by  Con-
gress  and  particularly  this  committee  that  proposal  is  on  hold.  We  are  concerned
that Mr. Proenza’s defending the interests of public safety and the emergency man-
agement community may have brought retribution on him.

Mr. Proenza is a dedicated servant of the American people. If you are uncomfort-
able  with  straight,  honest,  truthful  answers  to  the  hard  questions  then  don’t  ask
Mr.  Proenza  the  question.  Because  that’s  what  you  are  going  to  get,  the  truth.  Mr.
Proenza  has  always  been  accessible  and  approachable.  He  really  cares  about  the
public  he  represents.  When  I  learned  that  Mr.  Proenza  had  been  appointed  the  Di-
rector  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center  I  was  extremely  happy  and  at  the  same
time  I  was  sorry  to  see  him  leave  managing  the  Southern  Regional  Office  of  the
NWS.  However,  The  NHC  is  a  vital  part  of  Mississippi’s  emergency  management
program.  The  information  provided  to  me  and  the  State  of  Mississippi  from  the
NHC  in  times  of  emergency  is  critical  in  the  decision-making  process  of  my  Emer-
gency Operations Center.

Mr. Proenza is an advocate for the people he serves and when he encounters prob-
lems  he  faces  them  head  on.  If  it  is  broken,  he  wants  it  repaired.  If  it  is  working

correctly, he wants it improved. In my dealings with Mr. Proenza he has never been
one to sit back and watch things happen. He is on the forefront making things hap-
pen.  Sadly  it  seems  that  he  made  the  mistake  of  trying  to  improve  the  National
Hurricane Center.

It  has  been  an  honor  and  a  pleasure  to  come  to  our  Capitol  to  meet  with  distin-
guished leaders of our nation’s Congress and present this testimony on behalf of Mr.
Proenza’s  leadership  at  the  NWS  Southern  Regional  Office.  I  will  be  happy  to  an-
swer any questions you may have.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ROBIE  ROBINSON,  DIRECTOR,  DALLAS
COUNTY  OFFICE  OF  SECURITY  AND  EMERGENCY  MANAGE-
MENT
Mr.  ROBINSON.  Chairman  Lampson,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking
Member  Inglis,  Members,  thank  you  very  much  for  inviting  me;
again,  Robie  Robinson,  Director  of  Security  and  Emergency  Man-
agement,  Dallas  County.  Today,  I  am  speaking  on  behalf  of  the
Emergency Managers’ Association of Texas.

As  you  know,  every  state  in  the  Nation  is  at  risk  to  disasters,
and  Texas  is  no  exception.  Disaster  situations  occur  in  our  state
practically  every  day.  From  ’89  to  2000,  floods  and  flash  floods
caused 35 percent of the weather-related deaths in Texas. They are
followed  in  order  by  tornadoes,  lightning,  winter  storms,  extreme
heat,  severe  thunderstorms,  and  finally,  hurricanes  and  tropical
storms.

As  I  was  preparing  this  testimony,  Texas  had  61  counties  with
declared  disasters  going  on.  We  also  know  that  a  proactive,  robust
emergency  management  program  can  reduce  risk,  property  loss,
and  even  death.  A  critical  component  of  local  emergency  manage-
ment programs is timely, accurate weather data that we can under-
stand.

Bill  Proenza  has  always  been  an  active  supporter  of  local  emer-
gency  managers.  During  his  tenure  as  the  Southern  Director,  Bill
ensured  that  the  local  emergency  managers  had  ready  access  to
weather information. He ensured that his folks took the time to un-
derstand  our  weather  information  needs.  He  ensured  that  they
were available during weather events to answer our questions and
provide  forecasts.  He  also  ensured  that  they  worked  closely  with
storm spotters and volunteer weather monitors to improve forecast
models.  Bill  encouraged  his  staff  to  conduct  training  classes,  teach
local  emergency  managers  one  on  one,  and  give  presentations  at
local events and conferences.

Support  for  local  emergency  managers  was  evident  in  my  first
emergency  management  position  in  Fisher  County,  Texas.  I  had
only  been  the  volunteer  EMC  for  ten  days  when  a  tornado  struck
the largest town in our community. It was not a large tornado, but
it was not a large town, either, and the warnings given by the Na-
tional  Weather  Service  and  the  follow-up  concern  that  they  dis-
played were incredible.

It  changed  the  relationship  from  Service  and  County  to  Robie
Robinson  and  Buddy  McIntyre,  who  worked  at  the  San  Angelo  of-
fice of the National Weather Service. I went on to learn a lot more
about  weather  from  Buddy,  and  he  hosted  the  first  disaster  exer-
cise  that  I  ever  participated  in  as  an  emergency  manager.  Now,  if
I  had  never  moved  from  rural  West  Texas,  I  would  have  chalked
that  one  up  to  small  town  hospitality,  but  now,  I  am  in  the  ninth
largest county in the Nation, and the relationship that I have with
the people there, Bill and Gary, is the same as it was back in West
Texas.  It  is  clear  to  me  that  the  commitment  of  the  National
Weather  Service  personnel  that  I  have  worked  with  is  a  reflection
of  the  leadership  that  they  had  coming  down  from  the  regional
level.

Thanks  to  Bill’s  leadership,  we  now  have  a  wealth  of  weather
data  available  in  our  emergency  operation  centers  that  we  did  not
have 10 years ago. That data increases the time available for emer-
gency managers and elected officials to consider alternative courses
of action, and choose the appropriate action to take.

Now, some people say that weather has changed, but the weath-
er  hasn’t  changed.  It  is  the  same  thing  it  was  when  I  was  Isaac
Cline was watching the clouds over Galveston before the 1900 hur-
ricane  that  is  still  the  deadliest  disaster  ever  to  have  struck  on
U.S. soil, but there are differences in us. There are different things
that we do. We have more citizens in buildings, more densely popu-
lated  cities,  more  people  who  don’t  rely  on  their  own  eyes  and
wives’  tales,  they  rely,  instead,  on  reliable  forecasts,  to  safeguard
their families and their businesses.

Thanks to Bill’s leadership, we have a National Weather Service
office  in  our  area  with  a  staff  of  professionals  who  keep  us  in-
formed  and  answer  our  questions  any  time,  day  or  night.  Local

emergency  managers  used  to  only  get  weather  warnings  and
watches information by NOAA Weather Radio, phone, or fax. Now,
we get them by Internet, e-mail, and pagers, as well as those other
options.  National  Weather  Service  personnel  listened  to  our  needs
and met them.

Bill  actively  pushed  for  the  Warning  Coordinating  Meteorologist
Program  to  support  local  emergency  managers.  The  National
Weather  Service  has  also  built,  during  his  tenure,  valuable  part-
nerships.  Just  a  couple  of  years  ago,  in  Galveston,  the  National
Weather  Service  opened  a  joint  office  with  the  Galveston  County
Emergency  Management  Agency.  This  is  an  innovative,  forward-
thinking  partnership.  Now,  we  all  claim  that  we  want  to  work  to-
gether  in  our  respective  fields,  but  how  many  of  us  voluntarily  go
in to share offices on a day to day regular basis?

Jack  Colley  is  the  State  Director  of  Emergency  Management  in
Texas, and he couldn’t be here today, but he asked me to say: ‘‘We
could  not  operate  without  the  National  Weather  Service.  They  are
a  key  partner  in  our  state,  and  Bill  is  an  innovator  and  an  advo-
cate  for  serving  the  needs  of  the  locals,  so  that  we  can  protect  the
people who rely on us.’’

My  county  is  currently  building  a  new  Emergency  Operations
Center  to  help  keep  our  citizens  safe.  I  hope  that  the  National
Weather Service will continue to look toward the future as we are,
and bring new tools and new products to the table. I hope that they
continue  the  personal  contact  with  emergency  managers  sur-
rounding  their  regional  offices.  I  hope  their  funding  will  be  main-
tained  at  a  level  that  we  won’t  ever  question  their  ability  to  serve
the  emergency  management  community  and  protect  our  people.  I
hope  I  can  see  and  rely  on  the  same  enthusiasm  and  commitment
from  the  National  Weather  Service  during  the  last  half  of  my  ca-
reer that I have witnessed during the first half.

In closing, I hope the National Weather Service will continue the
partnerships,  energy,  and  knowledge  and  innovation  that  Bill
Proenza  fostered.  I  hope  the  information  sharing  will  continue  to
us  at  the  local  level,  as  we  are  the  conduits  through  which  their
warnings and watches are delivered to the moms and the dads and
the  sisters  and  brothers  whose  actual  literal  lives  depend  on  that
information.

Members of the Subcommittees, forecasting the weather requires
courage,  because  human  beings  don’t  control  the  weather.  But  I
hope the leadership of NOAA and the National Weather Service do
not  move  in  this  new  century  by  squelching  the  courage  of  their
people to speak out when they feel it is important.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBIE ROBINSON

Chairman  Lampson,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  Ranking
Member  Sensenbrenner  and  Subcommittee  Members,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to
speak  to  you  this  morning.  My  name  is  Robie  Robinson.  I  am  the  Director  of  Secu-
rity and Emergency Management for Dallas County, Texas, and I am here to speak
on behalf of the Emergency Managers’ Association of Texas.

As  you  know,  every  state  across  the  Nation  is  at  risk  to  some  form  of  disaster.
Texas  is  no  exception.  Our  state  is  vulnerable  to  multiple  forms  of  disaster  situa-
tions—whether  they  are  triggered  by  an  act  of  nature,  an  accident,  or  man-made.
We know from historical data that disaster situations occur in the state nearly every

day, and weather threats cause the majority of deaths. From 1989–2000, floods and
flash floods caused 35 percent of the weather-related deaths in Texas. These are fol-
lowed  by  tornadoes,  lightning,  winter  storms,  extreme  heat,  severe  thunderstorms,
and  finally  by  hurricane/tropical  storms.  As  I  was  preparing  this  testimony,  Texas
had 61 counties dealing with declared disasters. We also know that a proactive and
robust  emergency  management  program  can  reduce  risk,  property  loss,  and  death.
A critical component of a local emergency management program is timely and accu-
rate weather data that decision-makers understand.

Bill  Proenza  has  always  been  an  active  supporter  of  local  emergency  managers.
During his tenure as the southern regional director, Bill ensured that the local gov-
ernment emergency managers had ready access to weather information. He ensured
his  Warning  Coordinating  Meteorologists  took  the  time  to  understand  our  weather
information  needs  and  to  explain  the  impacts  and  probabilities  of  weather  events
on our local areas. He ensured the Warning Coordinating Meteorologists were avail-
able  during  weather  events  to  answer  our  questions,  provide  forecasts,  and  discuss
the  various  weather  products  with  us.  He  also  ensured  the  Warning  Coordinating
Meteorologists  worked  closely  with  the  storm  spotters  and  volunteer  weather  mon-
itors to improve the forecast models that applied to our most common hazard, flood-
ing.

The  Warning  Coordinating  Meteorologists  and  National  Weather  Service  fore-
casters  provide  valuable  training  for  local  emergency  managers  and  weather  spot-
ters. Bill supported and encouraged his staff to conduct training classes, teach local
emergency  managers  one-on-one,  and  give  presentations  at  local  events  and  profes-
sional conferences.

National  Weather  Service  support  for  local  emergency  managers  was  evident  in
my first emergency management position in rural Fisher County, Texas. I had only
been  the  volunteer  EMC  for  10  days  when  a  tornado  struck  in  the  middle  of  the
largest town in the county. It wasn’t a large tornado, but it wasn’t a large town ei-
ther. The National Weather Service assistance began with tornado warnings, but it
did  not  end  there.  They  stayed  in  touch  as  we  had  crews  searching  through  debris
and  cleaning  up  streets  over  the  next  several  days.  The  warnings  given  by  the  Na-
tional  Weather  Service  and  the  follow-up  concern  that  they  displayed  were  incred-
ible.  That  experience  changed  the  relationship  from  Service  and  County,  to  Robie
Robinson and Buddy McIntyre, Warning Coordination Meteorologist for the San An-
gelo office of the National Weather Service. I went on to learn more about thunder-
storms and weather from Buddy and he hosted the first disaster exercise that I at-
tended as an emergency manager. If I had never moved, I would have put it all off
to  small  town  hospitality,  but  I  am  now  in  the  ninth  largest  county  in  the  Nation
and  the  relationship  that  I  have  with  Bill  and  Gary  in  the  Fort  Worth  office  is  the
same.  They  interact  with  the  emergency  managers  in  our  area  on  a  regular  basis.
That  is  how  they  are  able  to  keep  an  eye  on  our  needs  and  modify  their  efforts  to
help us. It is clear to me that the commitment of the National Weather Service per-
sonnel  with  whom  I  have  worked  is  a  reflection  of  the  leadership  they  had  at  the
regional level.

Bill’s  support  of  local  emergency  managers  also  applied  to  the  River  Forecasting
Centers. The Fort Worth River Forecast Center worked closely with local emergency
managers as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Texas River Authorities
before,  during,  and  after  heavy  rainfall  and  flooding  events.  This  coordination  has
been critical in our abilities to protect critical infrastructures, government facilities,
and the public from flooding events.

The  new  weather  products  now  available  are  very  useful  in  our  planning  efforts.
We  have  various  text  products,  river  data,  hydrographs,  various  precipitation  im-
ages,  reports  and  forecasts.  We  now  have  better  maps,  charts,  and  tables;  weather
forecasts,  hydrometeorological  data  and  discussion,  climate  data,  and  historical
data. Local emergency managers get the weather information we need in the format
that best meets our needs thanks largely to the programs and the leadership of Bill
Proenza.

The  increased  variety  of  weather  products,  discussions,  and  graphs,  coupled  with
probability estimates improved decision-making in our emergency operations centers
before  and  during  extreme  weather  events.  We  now  have  a  wealth  of  weather  data
available in our emergency operations centers that did not exist ten years ago. That
data,  and  our  understanding  of  it,  increases  the  time  available  for  the  local  emer-
gency manager and the elected officials to consider alternative courses of action and
to  select  the  most  appropriate  one  for  the  jurisdiction.  Bill  worked  with  local  emer-
gency managers to ensure we had the data we needed.

There  are  those  who  say  that  technology  has  changed  our  world  so  that  the
weather is different or that our dependence on weather has lessened over the years.
I  would  say  that  weather  is  not  any  different  today  than  what  it  was  back  when

Isaac Cline was watching the clouds in Galveston, Texas before the 1900 hurricane
that  is  still  the  deadliest  disaster  to  have  struck  in  the  United  States.  There  are,
however,  differences  in  us  and  how  we  live.  Our  vulnerability  is  even  greater  than
ever before. We have more citizens, buildings and vehicles at risk, and more densely
populated  cities  with  people  who  rely,  not  on  their  own  eyes  and  wives’  tales,  but
instead  on  reliable  scientific  forecasts  to  safeguard  their  businesses  and  their  fami-
lies.  Thanks  to  Bill’s  leadership,  we  have  a  National  Weather  Service  Office  with
a  staff  of  professionals  who  work  to  keep  us  informed  and  to  answer  our  questions
any time, day or night.

We have all learned to listen to forecasts and we have all heard when there were
watches  and  warnings  in  our  area.  Admittedly,  I  am  among  the  ranks  of  profes-
sional  emergency  managers  who  are  professional  paranoids.  It  is  my  job  to  watch
the weather and plan for disasters but everyone wonders whether it will rain during
the  game  or  if  today  is  a  good  day  to  go  to  the  beach  or  to  the  lake.  We  rely  on
the National Weather Service for that information.

The National Weather Service distributes weather data based on our needs. Local
emergency  managers  used  to  get  weather  warnings,  watches,  and  information  only
by  NOAA  Weather  Radio,  phone  or  fax.  Now  we  get  them  from  the  Internet,  by  e-
mail,  and  by  pagers.  The  Warning  Coordinating  Meteorologists  and  other  National
Weather  Service  Personnel  listened  to  the  local  emergency  managers  needs  for
weather-related  information  and  they  met  them.  Bill  Proenza  actively  pushed  for
the  Warning  Coordinating  Meteorologist  program  and  for  the  National  Weather
Service  support  of  local  emergency  managers.  The  improvements  we  experienced
over the last ten years would not have occurred without his leadership in the south-
ern region.

I  interact  with  people  all  over  the  state  on  a  regular  basis.  People  from  cities,
counties, private industry, health care, transportation, State employees, and federal
personnel.  Across  the  board,  they  have  nothing  but  positive  comments  when  asked
about  the  National  Weather  Service.  Under  Mr.  Proenza’s  leadership,  the  southern
region built this reputation and those in place today are working diligently to main-
tain  it.  However,  don’t  make  the  mistake  of  thinking  that  they  are  content  to  stop
there. They are constantly leaning forward in the saddle looking for new, innovative
ways  to  help  us  do  our  jobs  better  for  the  people  of  the  Lone  Star  State.  I  have  at-
tended numerous meetings where I have spoken with National Weather Service rep-
resentatives  who  were  eager  to  hear  comments  from  emergency  managers  about
how we used their products and what we would like to see in the future.

The National Weather Service has also built valuable partnerships. Just a couple
of  years  ago,  they  opened  a  new  office  jointly  with  Galveston  County  Emergency
Management.  This  is  an  innovative,  forward  thinking  partnership.  We  all  want  to
claim  that  we  can  cooperate  with  others  in  our  respective  fields  but  how  many  of
us actually go so far as to share our offices daily. Emergency managers and the Na-
tional  Weather  Service  have  a  strong  tradition  of  working  together  but  that  isn’t
enough.  It  is  more  important  to  look  toward  the  future  and  to  ensure  that  we  are
prepared.  That  is  where  the  southern  region  was  incredibly  effective  during  Mr.
Proenza’s  tenure.  When  I  was  fighting  wildfires  across  the  state  for  the  Texas  For-
est  Service  in  2000,  I  knew  I  could  and  frequently  did  call  the  National  Weather
Service for spot weather forecasts. This required that meteorologists stop what they
were doing and give me specific information for the very coordinates where property
and lives were hanging in the balance. I needed that information to keep firefighters
safe  and  to  protect  the  homes  and  ranches  of  many  of  our  citizens.  These  efforts
weren’t required; they were done because the service and the people behind it knew
they needed to be done. I was safer and better able to do my job with the knowledge
that they shared.

In the end, the National Weather Service is not a federal agency with people who
sit in Washington to hand down products, guidelines, and grant funds. It is an agen-
cy  of  people  who  provide  essential  services  to  the  emergency  management  commu-
nity.  Jack  Colley,  the  Texas  State  Emergency  Management  Director  could  not  be
here today but he asked me to say, ‘‘We could not operate in Texas without the Na-
tional Weather Service. They are a key partner in our state. Bill Proenza is an inno-
vator and an advocate for serving the needs of the locals so that we can protect the
people who rely on us.’’

My county is currently building a new Emergency Operations Center with County
funds,  not  grant  funds,  to  help  keep  our  citizens  safe.  I  hope  that  the  National
Weather  Service  will  continue  to  look  toward  the  future  and  bring  new  tools  and
products  to  the  table.  I  hope  that  they  continue  the  personal  contact  with  profes-
sional  emergency  managers  surrounding  their  regional  offices.  I  hope  their  funding
will  be  maintained  at  a  level  such  that  we  won’t  ever  question  their  value  or  their
ability  to  serve  the  emergency  management  community  and  protect  our  people.  I

hope that I see can see and rely on the same enthusiasm and commitment from the
National  Weather  Service  during  the  last  half  of  my  career  that  I  saw  and  relied
on  in  the  first  half.  They  share  in  our  common  goal  and  our  common  role  as  we
work hand-in-hand to protect people.

In closing, I hope that the NWS will continue the partnerships, energy, knowledge
and  innovation  that  Bill  Proenza  fostered.  I  hope  that  the  information  sharing  will
continue  to  us  at  the  local  level  as  we  are  the  conduits  from  which  the  warnings
and  watches  are  communicated  to  the  Moms  and  Dads  and  sisters  and  brothers
whose very lives depend on that information.

Members of the Subcommittees, forecasting the weather requires courage because
human  beings  can  not  control  what  is  going  to  happen.  I  hope  that  the  leadership
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather
Service do not move into this new century by squelching the courage of their people
to speak out.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBIE ROBINSON

Mr. Robie Robinson is currently the Director of the Dallas County Office of Secu-
rity  and  Emergency  Management.  Dallas  County  is  the  ninth  largest  county  in  the

DISCUSSION

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
We will move into our first round of questions, and I yield myself

five minutes, as the Chairman.

DIRECTOR PROENZA’S TENURE IN THE SOUTHERN REGION

You  have  commented  on,  both  Mr.  Robinson  and  Mr.  McKinnon,
have  commented  on  the  work  that  Mr.  Proenza  did  as  Director  of
the  Southern  Region.  He  met  the  needs  of  your  offices.  Did  you
have any concerns about the quality of the products that he would
deliver,  or  his  agency  would  deliver  to  your  agencies,  your  offices?
Mr.  MCKINNON.  On  the  contrary,  no  problems  with  the  products
at  all,  and  if  he  had  questions,  then  he  would  come  to  us  and  ask
if we needed to improve what he was offering to us.

Mr. ROBINSON. Typically, he would ask us if we needed anything

else, and we got what we asked for.

Chairman LAMPSON. Consider him a people person? Did he have

a hard time getting along with people?

Mr. MCKINNON. Very approachable and a very personable person

to me.

Chairman LAMPSON. Did you have any reason to lack confidence
in the forecasts, warnings, data, or other product that you had been
receiving from the Center?

Mr. ROBINSON. None at all.

HURRICANE RESEARCH DIVISION AND HURRICANE CENTER

COLLABORATION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Dr.  Atlas,  did  you  ever  discuss  with  Mr.
Proenza  greater  collaboration  between  the  Hurricane  Research  Di-
vision and the Hurricane Center, after he became Director in Janu-
ary?

Dr.  ATLAS.  Yes,  I  did.  When,  immediately  after  Bill  became  Di-
rector,  we  were  both  approached  by  the  NOAA  Chief  of  Staff,  and
we were asked to work closely together, to bring research and oper-
ations  much  closer,  and  to  be  able  to  transition  more  of  what  we
do in research into the operations of the Hurricane Center.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  How  was  that  received  by  people  who

worked beneath the two of you?

Dr.  ATLAS.  The  people  who  worked  at  AOML,  at  the  Hurricane
Research  Division,  were  extremely  pleased.  We  had  been  wanting
to  do  this  for  many  years.  It  had  not  been  as  effective  as  it  could
have  been  in  the  past.  There  are  many  new  developments  in  re-
search  that  need  to  get  into  operations,  and  we  were  working  ex-
tremely well together to bring that about.

HURRICANE RESEARCH

Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  would  a  research  program  look  like,
to accomplish the goal of figuring out how to forecast hurricane in-
tensity, if that is the primary question?

Dr.  ATLAS.  In  order  to  be  able  to  forecast  hurricane  intensity
well,  we  need  to  have  numerical  models  at  very  high  resolution,
that are capable of representing the key processes that go on with-
in the hurricane, including the hurricane core. What this means is
we  need  to  have  better  and  more  observations,  we  need  to  have
better  ways  of  using  that  data.  We  need  to  have  a  better  under-
standing, and we must have these new models.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  kind  of  observational  data  will  be
needed  to  develop  our  understanding  of  hurricane  intensity,  and
what kinds of sensors does that imply, that we will need in the fu-
ture?

Dr.  ATLAS.  Well,  we  need  essentially  everything  we  have  there
now,  but  we  need  more  of  it,  and  we  need  it  at  higher  resolution.
If we are—the models that are being run now were based on obser-
vations that were at pretty coarse resolution, and so were the mod-
els. Now, as we get down to a few kilometers in scale in our numer-
ical  weather  prediction  models,  we  must  have  data  that  is  on  a
comparable  scale.  We  need  it  for  the  development  of  the  models,
and we need it to provide initial conditions to the models.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  How  would  findings  from  such  a  research
program  be  translated  into  upgrades  to  models  or  other  tools  and
techniques for the staff at the Hurricane Center?

Dr.  ATLAS.  This  is,  there  is  a  process  in  NOAA  for  transitioning
research,  and  there  are  new  facilities  that  will  make  this  go  even
better.  There  is  something  called  the  Developmental  Test  Center,
located  in  Colorado,  which  enables  researchers  to  work  with  the
operational  models,  and  enable  us  to  upgrade  them.  Ultimately,  it

goes through the Joint Hurricane Testbed at the Hurricane Center,
and if it passes the test, it then goes into operations.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  only  have  a  few
seconds left. I am going to yield that back, and I am going to turn
it over to Mr. Diaz-Balart for five minutes.

MORE ON THE HURRICANE CENTER PERSONNEL

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank

you gentlemen for being here.

Also,  I  just  want  to  tell  the  Chairman  and  others  on  the  Com-
mittee, and my dear friend, Mr. Klein, that one thing that is worth
seeing  is  the  operation  that  Dr.  Atlas  has  down  there  in  South
Florida,  incredible  people  and  led  very  well  by  Dr.  Atlas,  and  I  re-
cently had the privilege to visit with them, and thank you for your
hospitality, sir.

I  am  glad  that  we  are  kind  of  getting  away  from  personnel
issues,  and  more  on  science  issues,  which  is  what  this  committee
knows  how  to  do,  and  we  don’t  know  how  to  deal  with  personnel,
nor  do  we  have  the  power  to,  but  since  a  couple  of  things  were
brought up, I very briefly want to address it.

Mr.  Robinson,  and  I  think  very  well,  stated  that  obviously,  we
need to make sure that the courage to do the right thing continues,
and  I  have  no  doubt  whatsoever  that  Mr.  Proenza  has  had  that
courage.  But  I  just  want  to,  you  know,  there  are  some  incredible
people  at  the  Hurricane  Center,  and  I  don’t  know  if  you  all  have
had,  you  know,  have  had  a  chance  to  meet  with  them,  but  since
I do live and represent that part of town, that part of the country,
you  know,  you  get  to  kind  of  know  some  of  them,  and  you  know,
Dr. Avila, James Franklin, so, so many, Richard Knabb, Dr. Knabb,
I  should  say,  Daniel  Brown.  There  are  so  many  incredible  leaders.
Obviously,  you  are  not,  and  I  know  you  are  not,  but  I  just  want
to  make  it  very  clear  for  the  record,  you  are  not  implying  that  the
people  in  the  Hurricane  Center  don’t  have  the  courage  or  the  ex-
pertise to do their job, correct? I mean, I know you are not——

Dr. ATLAS. That is correct.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  But  I  just  want  to  make  sure  that,  you  know,

right.

Dr. ATLAS. That is correct.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  I  don’t  want  anybody  to  ever  misinterpret
what you are saying, because I thought you were very positive and
very clear.

IMPROVING HURRICANE FORECASTING

Getting  back  to  the  science  now.  Dr.  Atlas,  you  and  I  have  had
conversations,  and  you  just  repeated  it  now,  that  one  of  the  areas
that  we  didn’t  need  to  do  much  better  is  in  forecasting  the
strength,  the  intensity  of  a  storm,  and  you  have  given  me  some,  I
think,  very  easy  to  understand  in  layman’s  terms,  explanations  as
to  where  we  are,  and  how  we  can  do  better,  and  if  you  could  just
give me a little bit of your outlook. Are you optimistic that we can
do better, and what do we need to do in order to do better?

Dr. ATLAS. When I left NASA to come to NOAA, I did it because
I had a specific goal in mind, and one of those goals deals with the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

68

improvement  of  hurricane  prediction.  I  agree  wholeheartedly  with
every positive statement said about the National Hurricane Center
and its personnel. They do an excellent job. It represents the state
of  our  science,  the  state  of  the  art.  However,  it  is  still  not  good
enough  for  what  the  Nation  needs.  We  need  to  narrow  the  cone  of
uncertainty.  I  believe  that  if  we  develop  the  kinds  of  models,  and
get  the  kinds  of  observations,  and  increased  understanding  that  I
have mentioned to forecast intensity, we will be able to narrow the
cone of uncertainty as well.

We  are  at  a  time  in  hurricane  science  where  resources  put  into
computing,  into  research,  into  model  development,  and  new  obser-
vations can have tremendous payoff.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will  yield  back.

Thank you, sir.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Diaz-Balart.  I

will recognize Ron Klein for five minutes.

ALTERNATIVES TO QUIKSCAT

Mr. KLEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Dr.
Atlas,  and  gentlemen,  for  coming  today,  and  being  part  of  our  dis-
cussion.

I was focusing, in my questions to Mr. Proenza, on the difference
of QuikSCAT and the role that QuikSCAT plays, and the difference
if QuikSCAT is unavailable or in some diminished capacity, on ma-
rine forecasting, and of course, hurricane forecasting in general.

Can  you  give  some  comment  on  the  quality  and  quantity  of  dif-
ference,  based  on  what  NOAA  said,  is  here—is  our,  after  pushing
them  a  little  bit,  but  here  is  the  backup  on  how  we  are  going  to
approach this, between the European satellite, and I guess there is
a  new  Indian  satellite  that  is  coming  online,  or  a  couple  of  other
things,  plus  the  other  data  and  resources  we  have  available  to  us.
Dr.  ATLAS.  There  is  actually  another  American  satellite  that  is
functioning right now called WINDSAT, and I have done numerical
experiments that show that WINDSAT does provide useful data, al-
though  not  nearly  as  accurate  or  as  much  as  QuikSCAT.  In  gen-
eral, if we only had WINDSAT to replace QuikSCAT, we would lose
about half of the beneficial effect of satellite surface wind data.

The European scatterometer, ASCAT, is comparable to their ear-
lier  scatterometer,  in  how  it  senses  the  surface  wind,  and  does  a
little  better  than  QuikSCAT  in  heavy  rain  situations,  but  is  much
poorer  in  terms  of  resolution  and  coverage,  and  does  not  have  the
ability to represent an entire storm circulation within its data cov-
erage.

We  believe  that  we  will  lose  some  forecast  accuracy.  Certainly,
if we do nothing, we will lose forecast accuracy, but the mitigation
plan  that  NOAA  has,  to  make  use  of  ASCAT,  to  augment  our  re-
connaissance aircraft, and to potentially put new observing systems
on  unmanned  aerial  systems,  could  mitigate  the  loss  of  QuikSCAT
very effectively. I think that one of the very good things NOAA has
done is to develop this mitigation plan, and it is being thought out
very carefully.

Mr.  KLEIN.  Okay.  And  just  a  followup  on  your  comments  on
ASCAT, and your previous comment, the fact that QuikSCAT in its
present form has more of a difficult time in heavy rains and things

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

69

like  that.  Are  we  already  currently  getting  data  from  ASCAT?  Is
that  part  of  our  engagement  currently,  or  is  that  just  as  a  backup
in the event QuikSCAT goes down?

Dr.  ATLAS.  We  just  started  receiving  data  from  ASCAT  very  re-
cently.  The  forecasters  are  evaluating  the  quality  of  the  data,  and
to what extent they can use it. There are several difficulties in ap-
plying  the  ASCAT  data  the  way  they  applied  QuikSCAT,  and  so,
there is a learning curve that we need to get over.

Mr. KLEIN. And is there anything else going on in the rest of the
world?  I  mean,  obviously,  the  Far  East  has  significant  storms  and
typhoons  and  a  lot  of  other  things,  other  countries,  other  tech-
nologies,  that  are  currently  in  place,  that  we  are  considering,  or
should  be  considering,  or  are  we  at  the  top  of  the  curve  here  in
science,  and  there  is  nothing  for  us  to  grab  onto  in  any  other  part
of the world?

Dr.  ATLAS.  Congressman,  there  are  other  countries  that  are  de-
veloping scatterometers, but we don’t know how good that data will
be, or even whether or not they will make it available to us. There
are  other  technologies  that  could  also  go  into  space,  or  be  used  on
aircraft, that would bring about or contribute to significant further
improvements in weather analysis and prediction.

MORE ON HURRICANE RESEARCH

Mr.  KLEIN.  Okay.  And  the  last  question  is,  we  have  heard  a
number  of  times  that  research,  it  is  not  just  the  satellite  or  the
buoy,  research  is  a  key  component  of  everything  from  developing
models to, you know, identifying new factors that we should be con-
sidering. Are we currently researching or supporting the level of re-
search that you believe is necessary for the future of weather fore-
casting at this moment, and if not, what do you recommend?

Dr.  ATLAS.  If  I  had  to  answer  with  a  yes  or  no,  I  would  have  to
say no, but that is partially because, as was pointed out earlier, sci-
entists never believe they have, that we have enough resources for
what we want to do.

I  think  the  level  of  resources  that  has  existed  up  to  this  point,
with  where  we  were  in  the  period  of  less  hurricane  activity,  and
the  state  of  our  science,  was  appropriate.  Now,  in  this  period  of
very  active  hurricanes,  and  the  fact  that  our  science  is  now  at  a
stage  where  we  can  rapidly  capitalize  upon  additional  resources,
certainly more would be warranted.

Mr.  KLEIN.  And  if  you  can  get  back  to  us  on  exactly  what,  it  is
easy to throw a number at something, but I think it would be help-
ful  to  this  committee  to  understand  what  specifics  that  we  could
support,  types  of  research,  the  amount  of  support,  resources  nec-
essary to get you where you need to be. Thank you.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Klein.  Mr.  Inglis,  five  min-

utes.

DIRECTOR PROENZA’S RELATIONSHIP WITH WITNESSES

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  McKinnon  and  Mr.
Robinson,  testimony  from  you  is  very  helpful  to  establish  that  Mr.
Proenza  is  a  capable  fellow,  who  did  excellent  work  while  he  was

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

in a liaison role with the two of you. Is that a good way to charac-
terize your testimony?

Mr. ROBINSON. Yes, sir. It is mine.
Mr. MCKINNON. It is fair enough.
Mr. INGLIS. That he was very effective in working with you, and
a  capable  fellow.  And  I  think  that  it  is  important  for  all  of  us  to
stipulate that that seems to be the case. You are here saying that,
and  apparently,  the  Administration  thought  that  when  they  hired
him  to  go  the  Center,  right?  Because  they  thought  he  was  a  very
capable fellow.

I just was out in the hallway with some teachers, and had a little
discussion  about  how,  do  you  think  it  is  possible  that  somebody
that  is  a  very  good  match  for  the  superintendent  of  schools  for  a
county is maybe not the best match as the principal of an elemen-
tary  school?  And  of  course,  they  immediately  were  shaking  their
heads yes. There is a different role involved. If you were the leader
of  a  small  elementary  school,  you  are  rubbing  shoulders  every  day
with the teachers, you are energizing them, you are being enthusi-
astic  about  their  kids  and  what  they  are  doing.  You  are  working
with  them  in  their  individual  lives.  Whereas  if  you  are  at  the  ed
shed, the district superintendent, you are basically interacting with
the community and principals, and various, at a different level.

Is  it  fair  to  say  that  your  interaction  with  Mr.  Proenza  sounds
like  it  might  fit  more  the  model  of  the  ed  shed  guy,  right,  the  dis-
trict  office  person,  that  was  interacting  with  you  as  community
members? Is that accurate?

Mr.  ROBINSON.  I  only  interacted  with  him  as  a  local  representa-

tive. I work on the county level.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Yeah,  so  you  worked  with  him  in  your  capacity  as

a county employee, right?

Mr. ROBINSON. County emergency management. Right.
Mr. INGLIS. You never worked for him.
Mr. ROBINSON. No, I did not.
Mr. INGLIS. And Mr. McKinnon, you never worked for him.
Mr. ROBINSON. No, sir. I never worked for him.
Mr.  INGLIS.  So,  in  that  way,  you,  while  your  testimony  is  very
helpful in seeing that he is a very capable fellow, and substantiates
the decision of the Administration to hire him in the first place, to
go to the Center, you really can’t testify as to what it would be like
to  work  with  him  in  a  group  of  46  people,  sometimes  24  hours  a
day,  sleeping  at  the  Center  when  a  storm  is  bearing  down.  You
really  don’t  know  what  it  would  be  like  to  be  there  with  him  in
that environment.

Mr. MCKINNON. And my comment would be, sir, we have worked
very closely over the years, and I found Mr. Proenza to be very ap-
proachable, very personable, and an effective leader.

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah.
Mr.  MCKINNON.  I  don’t  believe  we  have  had  enough  time  at  the
National  Hurricane  Center  to  find  out  exactly,  we  haven’t  even
gone  through  an  entire  hurricane  season  with  him  at  the  helm,  to
find out exactly how effective he would be at the Hurricane Center.
Mr.  INGLIS.  Right.  And  of  course,  if  23  people  of  the  46  say  that
he is not effective, and hurricane season is coming on, it sort of in-
dicates  it  is  a  scary  proposition,  that  23  say  the  elementary  school

71

teachers  don’t  have  confidence  in  the  elementary  school  principal,
and  think  perhaps  he  or  she  should  go  back  to  the  district  office.
And  of  course,  I  would  ask  my  colleagues  to  be  thinking  about
how  we  have  different  relationships  with  our  staff,  perhaps,  than
we do with our constituents. With our constituents, we can be very
friendly.  They  are  out  there.  With  our  staff,  we  might  have  a  very
different relationship. And so, it is a different role, right?

Mr. MCKINNON. Yes, sir, but I think the word be out if your staff
disliked you for that reason, and I have never heard that about Mr.
Proenza.

Mr.  INGLIS.  You  know,  I  have  always  been  amazed  at  Members
of  Congress  getting  away  with  it.  But  anyway,  I  have  no  further
questions. Thank you.

RETURNING DIRRECTOR PROENZA TO HIS FORMER POSITION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Just  one  thing,  as  we  wrap  this  up.  How
would  either  of  you,  Mr.  McKinnon  and  Mr.  Robinson,  react  to  a
decision  that  would  return  Mr.  Proenza  to  his  former  position  as
Director of the Southern Regional Office?

Mr. ROBINSON. I would be very happy to hear that.
Mr.  MCKINNON.  Let  me  think  about  the  question  a  moment,  sir.
That  is  a  very  good  question.  I  think  Mr.  Proenza  has  a  lot  of  po-
tential. I think he has a lot to offer the American public, to the Na-
tional  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  and  to  the  Na-
tional  Weather  Service.  I  think  he  would  do  the  National  Hurri-
cane  Center  and  the  American  public  very  proud,  and  I  think  he
would make it, again, not to say that it has lost its reputation, but
I think he would elevate its reputation back to the premiere hurri-
cane  center  in  the  world,  given  the  opportunity  to  advance  the
ideas that he has.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Gentleman,  thank  you.  Does  anyone  else

have any? Mr. Diaz-Balart.

INVESTIGATING PERSONNEL PROBLEMS

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for your
indulgence.  And  again,  sort  of  speaking  hypothetically,  but—and
again,  as  someone  who  really  likes  Mr.  Proenza,  I  think  he  is  a
really good, decent man. And I think, not only that, that he is real-
ly  trying  to  do  the  best  job  he  can.  And  I  don’t  think,  see,  I  don’t
think there are any evil people here. This is not a conspiracy thing.
I don’t buy that. I think it is what it is.

But  let  me  just  ask  you  this,  then,  kind  of  theoretically,  as  well.
If  you  all  have  a  number  of,  you  supervise  an  individual,  and  that
individual  has  a  number  of  people  that  he  or  she  supervises,  and
if you get notified by those employees, half of them, the very people
that you really respect, that their supervisor, the person that works
under  you,  they  cannot  work  with,  that  they  are  having  major
problems with, and you know that it is a very important job, would
you  ignore  that  request?  Will  you  just  say  I  don’t  care  what  you
say, I am not going to do anything about it? Would you, in one way
or  another,  and  there  are  different  ways  of  doing  that?  Or  would
you  try  to  see  what  is  actually  going  on,  to  make  sure  that  things
are running smoothly?

Mr. MCKINNON. Are you directing the question to me, sir?
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Whoever, you know, whoever wants to.
Mr. MCKINNON. I believe there is two sides to every story, as you

have said.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Absolutely.
Mr. MCKINNON. And for a matter of record, I do not want to cast
any doubt on the credibility or the professionalism of anyone at the
National Hurricane Center.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Which is what I hope we don’t do.
Mr.  MCKINNON.  Exactly.  Thank  you.  Certainly  not.  Certainly

not.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Right.
Mr.  MCKINNON.  I  do  believe,  in  this  case,  opposites  do  not  at-
tract, and we may have some friction there. As with any case, and
to  answer  your  question,  I  do  have  people  that  report  to  me,  and
I  do  have  supervisors  that  report  to  me.  If  there  is  a  problem  that
the  supervisor  cannot  resolve,  then  I  do,  if  the  information  if
brought to me, I do question the supervisor, and I question the per-
son who has made the allegations, and we try to come to a suitable
conclusion for all the parties that matter.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  And  I  think,  again,  in  a  more  hypothetical
way, I think that would be the only responsible, what I do now, we
can  argue  as  to  what  procedure  you  should  take,  in  order  to  do
that,  but  I  think  it  would  be,  frankly,  not  reasonable  to  expect,  if
you have people that are well respected, who complain, and maybe
they don’t have good reason to, I think it would be totally irrespon-
sible to not try to find out whether there is something to those com-
plaints.  And  the  reason  I  mention  that  is  because  again,  I  don’t
think there are, I agree with you, I don’t think there are evil people
here.  The  people  at  the  Hurricane  Center,  by  the  way,  who  have
not lost their reputation, who are incredible and who are very good,
despite  what,  again,  you  know,  we  all  say  some  things  that  we
shouldn’t say, I am sure we regret up here, but I am talking about
Members of Congress, not you.

But  when  you  have  professionals  at  the  Hurricane  Center,  with
good or not so good reasons, whether an individual there is making
the  job  impossible  to  do,  I  think  it  would  be  irresponsible  to  not
take  measures,  whether  the  right  ones  are  taken  or  not,  to  try  to
address.  So,  therefore,  I  don’t  see  how  NOAA  acted  wrong.  I  don’t
see how Mr. Proenza acted wrong. I don’t see how the people in the
Hurricane  Center  acted  wrong.  I  think  what  you  have  here  is,
frankly,  people  that  just  can’t  work  together  very  well.  It  doesn’t
mean they are evil. It doesn’t mean they are not qualified, because
clearly,  Mr.  Proenza  is  qualified,  and  clearly,  the  people  in  the
Hurricane Center are qualified. And clearly, NOAA has tried to ad-
dress it.

Would you disagree with that kind of general assessment?
Mr.  ROBINSON.  No,  I  think  that  is  a  reasonable  statement.  But

I don’t have all the inside knowledge.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Correct.
Mr. ROBINSON. And neither do you.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Correct.
Mr.  ROBINSON.  I  mean,  you  have  said  that,  and  I  think  that,
given that, all we can do is look at it from the outside and evaluate

it. I have given my perspective, and you all will have to work from
your perspective.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  we  obviously  appreciate

the perspective. Thank you, sir. Thank you, gentlemen.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Diaz-Balart.  Gentlemen,
thank  you  very,  very  much  for  your  time,  your  insight,  your  an-
swers.  May  you  all  have  a  good  day.  I  hope  you  make  your  flight,
and it is a nice one, and we will call you again.

At  this  point,  well,  shall  we  take—stand  up,  and  take  a  deep
breath  as  he  comes  in.  Admiral  Lautenbacher  will  be—Vice  Admi-
ral Lautenbacher is the next witness.

[Recess.]

Panel III

Chairman  LAMPSON.  After  a  very  brief  recess,  we  welcome  the
next  panel,  and  that  includes  Vice  Admiral  Conrad  Lautenbacher,
who  is  the  Under  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmos-
phere,  and  the  Administrator  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric Administration.

And also, Dr. James Turner, Deputy Director of the National In-
stitute  of  Standards  and  Technology.  Dr.  Turner  led  the  assess-
ment  team,  at  the  request  of  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  and  will  tes-
tify  on  the  assessment  and  the  findings  of  the  assessment  team’s
report.

Again, as our witnesses should know, spoken testimony is limited
to  five  minutes,  after  which,  we  will  ask,  as  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee, five minutes, and it is also the common practice of the Sub-
committee  to  take  testimony  under  oath.  Do  you  have  any  objec-
tions to being sworn in?

You  also  have  the  right  to  be  represented  by  counsel.  Is  anyone

represented by counsel today?

So, if you will, please stand and raise your right hand.
[Witnesses sworn]
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, gentlemen. If you will have your

seats, and Dr. Lautenbacher, would you please begin?

STATEMENT  OF  VICE  ADMIRAL  CONRAD  C.  LAUTENBACHER,
JR.  (U.S.  NAVY,  RET.),  UNDER  SECRETARY  OF  COMMERCE
FOR  OCEANS  AND  ATMOSPHERE;  ADMINISTRATOR,  NA-
TIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION
(NOAA)
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking
Member  Inglis,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee,  and
staff. I am here at your request today to address issues concerning
the  Tropical  Prediction  Center’s  National  Hurricane  Center,  and
the decision to place its Director, William Proenza, on leave.

Before  I  begin,  however,  I  want  to  make  clear  to  the  Committee
and  all  residents  of  coastal  states  in  no  uncertain  terms  that
NOAA,  the  National  Weather  Service,  and  the  TPC  are  fully  pre-
pared  for  this  hurricane  season.  Our  forecasting  ability  continues
to  improve,  and  the  American  people  can  expect  nothing  less  than
the full capabilities of the National Hurricane Center.

The  scientists  and  forecasters  at  the  TPC  answer  to  one  of  the
highest  callings  in  public  service,  the  protection  of  life  and  prop-
erty.  They  have  dedicated  their  careers  to  preparing  their  fellow
citizens  for  the  dangers  brought  on  by  tropical  weather.  When  a
storm  is  bearing  down,  they  continue  to  calmly  provide  accurate
and timely forecasts.

It is for these reasons that we want to provide them with all the

support they need to do their jobs.

In  recent  weeks,  some  concerns  about  operations  at  the  TPC
have  come  to  my  attention.  When  Mary  Glackin,  a  career  NOAA
employee  with  22  years  of  experience  in  the  National  Weather
Service and 30 in NOAA, became Acting Director of the Service on
June  11,  2007,  she  was  aware  of  a  need  to  improve  managerial
rigor throughout National Weather Service operations. She prompt-
ly communicated to all senior staff the need for adherence to orga-
nizational policies, procedures, and the chain of command.

In  response  to  information  the  TPC  Director,  William  Proenza,
may  have  disregarded  direct  instructions  from  his  supervisor,  Ms.
Glackin  specifically  counseled  Mr.  Proenza  about  these  matters  on
June  14,  2007.  On  June  19,  Ms.  Glackin,  responding  to  a  request
of  a  TPC  employee,  participated  in  a  conference  call  with  11  em-
ployees at the Hurricane Center, including seven of the nine hurri-
cane specialists.

Despite  expressing  fear  of  retaliation  for  expressing  their  views,
the  participants  on  the  call  said  that  they  felt  muzzled  by  Mr.
Proenza,  that  he  lacked  the  knowledge  of  the  hurricane  program
necessary  to  make  informed  decisions  about  the  future  of  the  pro-
gram and hurricane forecasts, and that his actions were generating
turmoil, fear, and a loss of cohesiveness at the Center.

When I was briefed about this call, I felt it was essential to look
into  what  appeared  to  be  significant  employee  complaints,  ques-
tioning whether they could do their job under Mr. Proenza’s leader-
ship.  In  fact,  I  felt  it  would  be  irresponsible  for  a  senior  manager
not to get to the bottom of the issue. Concerned about the ramifica-
tions  of  this  discontent  during  the  middle  of  the  hurricane  season,
I  decided  we  needed  an  immediate,  fair,  and  impartial  assessment
of  these  allegations,  independent  of  the  National  Weather  Service.
With lives potentially at stake, inaction was not an option.

Dr.  Jim  Turner,  Deputy  Director  of  the  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology,  agreed  to  lead  a  team  to  assess  oper-
ations at the TPC. The team was given a broad mandate to address
management,  organizational  structure,  and  operations.  On  Friday,
July  6,  Dr.  Turner  provided  preliminary  findings.  Specifically,  the
Team advised that, based on their firsthand observations, ‘‘the con-
tinued  presence  of  Director  Proenza  at  the  TPC  will  interfere  with
the ability of the assessment team to complete its work.’’ Moreover,
it  was  the  ‘‘unanimous  opinion  of  the  assessment  team  that  Mr.
Proenza’s  actions  during  the  assessment  have  not  only  failed  to
calm  his  staff,  but  have  actually  resulted  in  a  level  of  anxiety  and
disruption  that  threatens  the  TPC’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  mission  to
protect the American people.’’

The Team cited incidents where Mr. Proenza questioned a senior
forecaster at his workstation about his interview, approached other
staff to ask for their support before they spoke with the Team, and

75

conducted media interviews on the operations floor while hurricane
specialists were attempting to perform their regular duties.

After  hearing  from  the  Team,  I  advised  Mr.  Proenza  on  July  9
that he was being placed on leave, based on the Team’s determina-
tion  that  his  presence  threatened  the  Center’s  ‘‘ability  to  fulfill  its
mission  to  protect  the  American  people.’’  On  Friday,  July  13,  the
assessment  team  presented  its  final  report.  It  found  that  ‘‘the
short-term ability of the TPC to provide accurate and timely infor-
mation was put at risk due to the TPC director’s disruptive conduct
and  the  lack  of  trust  between  many  staff  and  the  director.’’  More
pointedly,  the  Team  determined  that  ‘‘the  TPC’s  ability  to  achieve
its  mission  was  seriously  threatened  because  of  the  environment
which  had  been  created  by  the  director’s  statements  and  actions.’’
Citing  actions  by  Mr.  Proenza  that  intimidated  and  alienated
staff,  damaged  teamwork,  and  produced  fears  of  retaliation,  the
Team concluded that ‘‘the negative work environment, exacerbated
by the director, has had—and is likely to continue to have—a major
deleterious impact on the center’s ability to fulfill its mission, if he
is allowed to return to his position.’’

The team recommended: ‘‘The current TPC Director should be re-
assigned and not be allowed to return to his position at the Center.
This  should  be  done  due  to  his  failure  to  demonstrate  leadership
within the TPC rather than due to his public statements.’’ The as-
sessment  team  also  included  a  number  of  other  recommendations
for improving operations at the TPC, the National Weather Service,
and  NOAA.  I  have  asked  my  Deputy  Under  Secretary  to  provide
a  written  review  and  response  to  these  recommendations  within
two weeks time.

Let  me  say  at  this  point  that  William  Proenza  has  a  long  and
distinguished career with the National Weather Services. Any deci-
sions  I  may  make  with  regard  to  these  recommendations  will  be
made  on  the  merits  of  the  Team’s  assessment  of  operations  at  the
National  Hurricane  Center,  and  not  on  any  other  issues  or  public
comments Mr. Proenza may have made.

A  copy  of  the  Team’s  report,  along  with  other  relevant  docu-
ments,  has  been  included  with  the  written  testimony  I  have  sub-
mitted for the record.

And  finally,  I  would  like  to  note  that  the  official  forecasts  of  the
Tropical Prediction Center do not come out of a computer. They do
not come out of a single satellite. Hurricane forecasting, at its core,
still comes down to a team of specialists coming together to analyze
all  available  data,  and  using  their  best  expertise  and  wisdom  to
make  a  forecast.  The  American  people  need  to  know  that  when  a
storm  is  bearing  down,  those  forecasters  are  focused  on  only  one
thing, that they feel free to offer their views, and that they are sup-
ported at the very highest levels.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR.

I  am  here  in  response  to  your  request  for  testimony  on  issues  concerning  the
Tropical  Prediction  Center’s  National  Hurricane  Center.  The  Committee  has  asked
me  to  provide  an  account  of  events  relating  to  the  hiring  of  and  recent  decision  to
place  on  leave  the  Director  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  (‘‘TPC’’),  Mr.  William
Proenza.

Before  I  begin,  however,  I  want  to  make  clear  to  the  Committee  and  all  the  resi-
dents  of  coastal  states  in  no  uncertain  terms  that  NOAA,  the  National  Weather
Service  and  the  TPC  are  fully  prepared  for  this  hurricane  season.  Our  forecasting
ability  continues  to  improve  and  the  American  people  can  expect  nothing  less  than
the full capabilities of the National Hurricane Center.

The  scientists  and  forecasters  at  the  TPC  answer  to  one  of  the  highest  callings
in  public  service—the  protection  of  life  and  property.  They  have  dedicated  their  ca-
reers to preparing their fellow citizens for the dangers brought on by tropical weath-
er.  When  a  storm  is  bearing  down,  they  continue  to  calmly  provide  accurate  and
timely forecasts.

It  is  for  these  reasons  that  we  want  to  provide  them  with  all  the  support  they

need to do their jobs.

In summer 2006, the then-Director of the TPC, Max Mayfield, informed me of his
decision  to  retire,  and  D.L.  Johnson,  the  then-Director  of  the  National  Weather
Service,  initiated  a  search  for  a  replacement.  In  November,  General  Johnson,  with
the  concurrence  of  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary,  General  (Ret.)  Jack  Kelly,  rec-
ommended to me that William Proenza be appointed as Director of the TPC.

Mr.  Proenza  began  employment  at  the  TPC  on  January  6,  2007.  During  January
to  May  2007,  Mr.  Proenza  made  a  series  of  statements  to  the  media  regarding  the
TPC’s  budget  and  the  potential  loss  of  NASA’s  QuikSCAT  research  satellite.  The
statements  about  the  budget  were  not  factually  accurate  and  the  statements  about
the  satellite  were  misleading  and  potentially  detrimental  in  terms  of  public  con-
fidence  in  the  Center’s  forecasts.  I  felt  that  some  of  these  statements  could  have
been  the  result  of  Mr.  Proenza’s  being  new  to  the  TPC  and  not  yet  up  to  speed  in
terms  of  his  new  role.  To  address  these  concerns,  I  instructed  senior  management
to  work  with  him  throughout  the  spring  and  to  provide  him  with  the  necessary  in-
formation and training to succeed as TPC Director, including detailed budget infor-
mation relating to TPC operations.

On June 11, 2007, Mary Glackin, a 30-year career NOAA employee with 22 years
of  experience  in  the  National  Weather  Service,  became  the  Acting  Director  of  the
National Weather Service. In assuming her duties, Ms. Glackin was made aware of
the  need  to  improve  managerial  rigor  throughout  National  Weather  Service  oper-
ations. Accordingly, at the outset of her tenure, Ms. Glackin communicated to senior
staff the need for adherence to organizational policies, procedures, and the chain of
command.

With respect to Mr. Proenza, Ms. Glackin was advised that since January, ‘‘there
[had]  been  times  when  [Mr.  Proenza]  may  have  disregarded  the  direct  instructions
of  [his]  supervisor,  the  Director,  National  Centers  for  Environmental  Prediction
(NCEP), or [had] made decisions on [his] own which [he] had no authority to make.’’
For  example,  Ms.  Glackin  had  learned  that  Mr.  Proenza  instructed  forecasters  to
replace  the  TPC  heading  with  the  ‘‘National  Hurricane  Center’’  label  on  the  March
4  High  Seas  forecast.  Because  this  action  embedded  the  word  ‘‘hurricane’’  in  the
forecast, it set off a ‘‘pan pan’’ alarm—a non-life threatening distress call—on every
ship in the Pacific Ocean. To make sure there was no misunderstanding and to clar-
ify  management  expectations,  Ms.  Glackin  issued  a  memorandum  on  ‘‘Operating
Procedures/Instructions,’’  dated  Thursday  June  14,  (attached)  and  met  with  Mr.
Proenza in person in Florida the next day, to discuss its contents.

Ms.  Glackin’s  memo  was  not  a  reprimand.  After  identifying  the  ‘‘pan  pan’’  alarm
and other instances over the past five months that had prompted her to prepare the
memo,  it  acknowledged  that  ‘‘[s]ome  of  this. . .might  have  resulted  from  some  con-
fusion  as  to  the  various  roles  and  responsibilities  in  the  [National  Weather  Serv-
ice].’’ Ms. Glackin, however, wanted to reiterate to him her instructions about adher-
ing to organizational policies, procedures and the chain of command, and that going
forward  she  ‘‘expect[ed]  that  [Mr.  Proenza]  and  [his]  staff  will  follow  the  directions
and the policies and procedures developed by NCEP.’’

In  particular,  Ms.  Glackin  asked  Mr.  Proenza  to  consult  on  a  regular  basis  with
his  direct  supervisor  on  issues  concerning  ‘‘budget,  science,  research,  and  oper-
ational  or  administrative  issues’’  that  had  ‘‘NOAA-  or  [National  Weather  Service]-
wide  implications  or  public  safety  consequences.’’  Ms.  Glackin  expressly  stated  that
she  was  ‘‘available  to  resolve  any  disagreements,’’  once  the  two  had  discussed  the
matter  fully,  and  expressed  the  intention  to  ‘‘work  together  to  ensure  accurate  pre-
dictions and to support the work of [the NCEP], [the National Weather Service], and
NOAA.’’

On  the  evening  of  June  18,  Ms.  Glackin  received  a  request  from  an  employee  at
the TPC for a conference call. The call took place on Tuesday, June 19, with eleven
TPC employees participating. These included seven of the nine TPC Hurricane Spe-
cialists;  the  TPC  Union  Steward  agreed  this  meeting  was  requested  by  the  TPC

77

group  and  did  not  constitute  a  formal  meeting  requiring  official  notification  to  the
union.

During  that  call,  Center  employees  raised  several  serious  concerns  about  Mr.
Proenza’s  actions,  and  whether  they  could  do  their  job  under  Mr.  Proenza’s  leader-
ship.  These  concerns  are  reflected  in  a  memorandum  for  the  record  (attached)  in-
cluding:

• They  feared  Mr.  Proenza  would  take  retaliatory  action  against  them  if  he
learned they were voicing their views, some stating they ‘‘were scared’’ of Mr.
Proenza and others that they were ‘‘deep[ly] concern[ed] that their future was
at stake if this meeting got out,’’
• They  felt  ‘‘muzzled’’  by  Mr.  Proenza,  citing  as  an  example  the  development
of  priorities  for  improving  hurricane  forecasting  agreed  to  by  the  hurricane
specialists,  ‘‘but  not  approved  by  [Mr.  Proenza],’’  and  therefore  not  permitted
to go forward to NCEP/NWS,
• They lacked confidence in Mr. Proenza’s knowledge of the hurricane program
and  were  concerned  that  Mr.  Proenza  would  make  decisions  about  its  future
without the required knowledge or willingness to listen to staff,
• They  believed  the  QuikSCAT  issue  had  been  ‘‘overblown’’  and  its  representa-
• They  questioned  his  ‘‘integrity’’  and  were  ‘‘outraged’’  at  his  misrepresenting
• They  felt  Mr.  Proenza’s  actions  were  generating  ‘‘turmoil,’’  ‘‘anxiety,’’  ‘‘fear,’’

the actions and views of his staff in the office and media, and

tion in the media ‘‘is not accurate,’’

and a loss of ‘‘cohesiveness’’ at the Center.

Ms.  Glackin  and  Dr.  Uccellini  were  gravely  concerned  by  what  they  had  heard,
and  communicated  to  me  their  conclusion  that  immediate  action  was  necessary.
Given  the  fact  that  seven  of  the  nine  TPC  Hurricane  Center  forecasters  were  ex-
pressing  these  concerns,  it  was  their  assessment  that  if  the  current  situation  per-
sisted,  the  Center  would  have  difficulty  fulfilling  its  life-saving  mission.  Because  of
the  serious  nature  of  the  situation,  I  consulted  with  my  chain  of  command  and  we
determined  we  had  no  other  choice  but  to  take  action.  Had  we  failed  to  act,  we
would  have  been  derelict  in  our  duties  as  public  servants  charged  with  protecting
people’s lives.

However,  in  our  judgment,  the  need  for  prompt  action  had  to  be  balanced  with
making sure we had a clear understanding of the situation and were fair to all con-
cerned.  We  therefore  decided  that  the  right  approach  was  to  convene  an  inde-
pendent  assessment  of  the  Center’s  management  and  operations  and  its  ability  to
meet  its  mission,  and  to  set  a  fairly  short  deadline  for  completion  of  this  assess-
ment.

Accordingly, on June 26, I requested that Dr. James Turner, NIST’s Deputy Direc-
tor,  lead  a  team  to  undertake  this  charge.  A  copy  of  my  memo  to  Dr.  Turner  is  at-
tached.  On  July  2,  a  memo  was  distributed  to  all  employees  of  the  Tropical  Pre-
diction  Center  advising  them  that  I  had  asked  for  this  independent  operational  as-
sessment  (attached).  I  further  stressed  that  the  ‘‘candid  views  and  opinions  of  the
entire  TPC  team  are  extremely  important  to  this  assessment’’  and  encouraged  ‘‘ev-
eryone’s engagement, participation, and support of this endeavor without fear of re-
taliation or criticism.’’ I also advised staff that the Team would be touring the Cen-
ter and would be available to conduct individual and group interviews.

On  Friday,  July  6,  Dr.  Turner  and  his  team  provided  me  with  a  preliminary  as-
sessment  and  recommendation  regarding  management  of  the  Center  (attached).
Specifically, the Team advised me that, based on their first-hand observations, ‘‘the
continued  presence  of  Director  Proenza  at  the  TPC  will  interfere  with  the  ability
of  the  assessment  team  to  complete  its  work.’’  Moreover,  it  was  the  ‘‘unanimous
opinion  of  the  assessment  team  that  Mr.  Proenza’s  actions  during  the  assessment
have not only failed to calm his staff but have actually resulted in a level of anxiety
and  disruption  that  threatens  the  TPC’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  mission  to  protect  the
American people.’’ In a series of documented incidents, Mr. Proenza had questioned
a  senior  forecaster  at  his  work  station  about  his  interview,  which  made  the  fore-
caster  uncomfortable  and  upset;  he  approached  other  staff  and  asked  for  their  sup-
port  before  they  spoke  with  the  Team;  and  he  held  media  interviews  on  the  oper-
ations  floor  about  the  assessment  while  the  hurricane  specialists  were  performing
their  duties  analyzing  tropical  activity.  The  team  thus  recommended  that  Mr.
Proenza be ‘‘temporarily removed from active direction of the Center until such time
as the assessment is complete and has been reviewed by NOAA management.’’

On  Saturday,  July  7,  2007,  Ms.  Glackin  sent  me  a  memo,  agreeing  with  the  rec-
ommendation  of  the  assessment  team,  and  recommending  that  Mr.  Proenza  be
placed on leave (attached).

The  following  Monday  morning,  July  9,  Mr.  Proenza  was  advised  that  he  was
being  placed  on  leave,  and  that  the  reason  for  doing  so  was  based  on  the  prelimi-
nary  determination  of  the  independent  assessment  team  that  his  presence  was
interfering with the Team’s completing its work, and resulting in a ‘‘level of anxiety
and  disruption  that  threatens  the  [Center’s]  ability  to  fulfill  its  mission  to  protect
the American people.’’ A copy of the memo issued to Mr. Proenza is attached to my
testimony.  A  memo  was  then  distributed  to  Center  employees  advising  them  that
Mr.  Proenza  would  be  on  leave  until  further  notice,  and  that  Deputy  Director  Ed
Rappaport  would  serve  as  acting  Director  of  the  Center  during  this  period  (at-
tached).

On  July  13,  Dr.  Turner  and  the  assessment  team  completed  the  report.  A  copy
of  the  report  is  attached  to  my  testimony.  The  team  found  that  the  TPC  is  tech-
nically  equipped  to  continue  to  provide  accurate  and  timely  information  regarding
hurricane-related activities. Specifically, the TPC’s readiness has been strengthened
by the addition of four new hurricane specialists in late 2006 (a two-thirds increase
over  prior  years),  the  addition  of  a  new  hurricane  forecast  model  this  year,  addi-
tional  buoys,  and  a  new  instrument  on  the  hurricane  reconnaissance  planes  that
will provide surface wind data.

At the same time, the Team found that ‘‘the short-term ability of the TPC to pro-
vide accurate and timely information was put at risk due to the TPC director’s dis-
ruptive  conduct  and  the  lack  of  trust  between  many  staff  and  the  director.’’  Even
more  pointedly.  ‘‘the  Team  concluded  that  the  TPC’s  ability  to  achieve  its  mission
was seriously threatened because of the environment which had been created by the
director’s  statements  and  actions.’’  The  team  cited  actions  by  Mr.  Proenza  that  in-
timidated  some  staff,  alienated  others,  damaged  teamwork,  and  produced  fears  of
retaliation. In short, the Team found that ‘‘[t]he negative work environment, exacer-
bated  by  the  director,  has  had—and  is  likely  to  continue  to  have—a  major  delete-
rious  impact  on  the  Center’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  mission,  if  he  is  allowed  to  return
to  his  position.’’  Drawing  on  these  findings,  the  Team  recommended  immediate  ac-
tion with respect to Mr. Proenza, due to his failure of leadership:

The  current  TPC  Director  should  be  reassigned  and  not  be  allowed  to  return
to  his  position  at  the  Center.  This  should  be  done  due  to  his  failure  to  dem-
onstrate  leadership  within  the  TPC  rather  than  due  to  his  public  statements
about  [the]  QuikSCAT  satellite  or  NOAA  leadership.  A  replacement  should  be
recruited  as  soon  as  possible  through  a  nationwide,  full  and  open  competition.
I  want  to  note  that  the  report  also  includes  a  number  of  other  recommendations
for improvement of the TPC, NCEP, NWS and NOAA. These include better manage-
ment  approaches  (e.g.,  establishing  ‘‘clear,  written  statements  of  authority  for  deci-
sion-making throughout the management chain at TPC’’), enhanced employee train-
ing  and  leadership  development  programs  (e.g.,  ‘‘[i]nstitut[ing]  formal  succession
planning and leadership programs for developing staff from within’’), additional sup-
port  for  identifying  and  addressing  technical  needs,  tighter  linkages  with  the  re-
search  and  user  communities  (e.g.,  establishing  a  ‘‘user  group  to  provide  regular
input’’ to the Center), clearer visioning, improved organizational structure in certain
areas,  stronger  integration  of  the  TPC  into  its  parent  organization,  and  constantly
improving  public  education  and  outreach.  I  have  directed  the  Deputy  Under  Sec-
retary,  Jack  Kelly,  to  lead  a  review  of  the  report  and  provide  a  response  to  the
Team’s  recommendations  within  two  weeks’  time  (attached).  Following  the  same
procedures we have used in responding to GAO reports, General Kelly will comment
on  the  report’s  findings  and  recommendations  and  detail  the  steps  to  be  taken  to
address the identified concerns.

Let me say at this point that William Proenza has a long and distinguished career
with the National Weather Service. Any decisions I may make with regard to these
recommendations will be made on the merits of the Team’s assessment of operations
at  the  National  Hurricane  Center  and  not  on  any  other  issues  or  public  comments
Mr. Proenza may have made.

And  finally,  I’d  like  to  note  that  the  official  forecasts  of  the  Tropical  Prediction
Center  do  not  come  out  of  a  computer.  They  do  not  come  from  a  single  satellite.
Hurricane  forecasting,  at  its  core,  still  comes  down  to  a  team  of  specialists  coming
together to analyze all available data and using their best expertise and wisdom to
make  a  forecast.  The  American  people  need  to  know  that  when  a  storm  is  bearing
down,  those  forecasters  are  focused  on  only  one  thing,  that  they  feel  free  to  offer
their  views  and  that  they  are  supported  at  the  very  highest  levels.  Again,  the  sci-
entists  and  forecasters  at  the  TPC—indeed,  employees  throughout  the  National
Weather Service and NOAA, including myself—answer to one of the highest callings
in  public  service—the  protection  of  life  and  property,  and  we  are  fully  prepared  for
this hurricane season.

STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES TURNER, DEPUTY DIRECTOR,
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY
Dr.  TURNER.  Thank  you,  sir.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Sub-
committees,  I  am  providing  information  to  you  today  pursuant  to
the formal request I received in writing from the Chairman.

I  am  happy  to  provide  a  brief  summary  statement  about  the
work  at  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center  of  the  independent  assess-
ment team. Our team was composed of Matthew Heyman, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, John Gunther, Department
of  Commerce,  Kathy  Kelly  and  Alexis  Gutierrez,  both  of  the  Na-
tional Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

We  were  charged  to  do  the  assessment.  When  we  were  charged
to do the assessment, we asked for a written scope. We were asked
to assess: One, the ability of the Tropical Prediction Center to con-
tinue to provide accurate and timely information; two, whether the
management  and  organization  structure  facilitates  TPC  achieving
its mission; and three, the extent to which lessons learned from re-
cent  hurricanes,  including  whether  the  2005  Gulf  Coast  events
have been incorporated.

Please  note  that  these  are  management  issues.  The  assessment
was  not  intended  to  be  a  technical  referendum  on  the  efficacy  of
the  QuikSCAT  satellite.  Discussion  of  QuikSCAT  was  only  perti-
nent  to  us,  insofar  as  it  impacted  the  three  areas  the  Team  was
asked  to  assess.  So  that  we  would  be  clear  on  what  our  mission
was,  we  also  asked  that  our  work  be  considered  independent.  We
zealously  guarded  that  independence,  and  that  independence  was
scrupulously respected by NOAA management.

Our process involved visiting the Center twice, touring the facili-
ties,  and  being  available  to  all  employees,  including  the  Director,
who  wanted  to  speak  with  us.  We  made  ourselves  available  to  the
employees at times that would not interfere with their work sched-
ule. In all, 31 of the 46 Center employees voluntarily came forward
to answer the prepared questions we had. Each employee was also
offered the opportunity to comment on any areas they felt pertinent
to our scope, which were not addressed in our questions.

Every  employee  we  interviewed  was  provided  with  a  written
draft  summary  of  what  we  thought  we  heard  as  their  responses.
The  employees  were  free  to  correct  the  draft  if  errors  were  de-
tected.  Using  the  interviews,  as  well  as  our  personal  observations
and firsthand experience at the Center, we developed a set of find-
ings  to  address  our  charge.  Where  we  thought  pertinent,  we  pro-
vided recommendations.

The  report  was  delivered  to  Admiral  Conrad  Lautenbacher  on
July  13,  2007.  At  this  point,  sir,  would  you  like  for  me  to  provide
a brief summary of the findings and recommendations?

Chairman LAMPSON. Yes, sir. Please.
Dr.  TURNER.  First,  we  divided  the  findings  up  according  to  the
three  areas  we  were  charged  to  address.  First,  the  ability  of  the
TPC to continue to provide accurate and timely information regard-
ing hurricane-related activities. Across the board, staff members of

113

the  TPC  are  highly  dedicated  to  achieving  the  mission  of  saving
lives and protecting property.

We  also  looked  at  the  technical  capability,  as  well  as  the  work
environment.  And  from  a  strictly  technical  standpoint,  the  TPC  is
equipped  to  continue  to  provide  accurate  and  timely  information.
However, the short-term ability of the TPC to provide accurate and
timely information was put at risk due to the Director’s disruptive
conduct, and the lack of trust between many staff and the Director.
The  negative  work  environment,  exacerbated  by  the  Director,  has
had and is likely to continue to have a major deleterious impact on
the  Center’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  mission,  if  he  is  allowed  to  return
to this position.

By the same token, simply replacing the Director will not resolve
the  Center’s  workplace  issues.  If  staff  morale  and  longstanding  or-
ganizational issues are not addressed, they will hinder the Center’s
ability to accomplish its mission. In the longer-term, the TPC faces
some potential degradation of its capabilities, if current data about
wind  speed  and  direction,  wind  vectors  over  the  oceans,  are  no
longer available due to the loss of QuikSCAT, before similar or bet-
ter data are available, through a yet to be designed alternative in-
strument.

The second charge, whether the management and organizational
structure facilitates their achieving their mission. The lack of effec-
tive supervisory oversight from NOAA, the National Weather Serv-
ice,  NCEP,  and  TPC  management,  has  contributed  significantly  to
longstanding problems at the Center, as well as the disruption over
the last six months.

And  finally,  to  whether  lessons  learned  were  incorporated,  we
used as our source document the Service Assessment from Katrina.
We found that the lessons learned were, in fact, incorporated, that
there were several best practices identified, and that there were re-
search  challenges  remaining,  the  primary  one  of  which  was  the
forecast of intensity.

Among  our  recommendations,  the  current  TPC  Director  should
be  reassigned,  and  not  be  allowed  to  return  to  his  position  at  the
Center. This should be done due to his failure to demonstrate lead-
ership  within  the  TPC,  rather  than  due  to  his  public  statements
about the QuikSCAT satellite, or NOAA leadership. A replacement
should  be  recruited  as  soon  as  possible,  through  a  nationwide  full
and  open  competition.  Morale  problems  and  division  among  staff
must  be  addressed  as  a  high  priority,  for  the  good  of  the  Center,
and to ensure that the organization can perform its mission.

NCEP, the National Weather Service, and NOAA should increase
their  focus  on  the  critical  technical  needs  in  hurricane  forecasting,
including  improved  Earth  ocean  surface  vector  wind  data,  inten-
sity,  understanding  and  forecasting,  and  modeling.  NOAA  leader-
ship at all levels must require the highest level of conduct and per-
formance  from  its  employees  and  its  managers.  Supervisors  must
know that they will be supported in the management of their oper-
ations, and held accountable for failure to manage effectively.

NOAA  must  communicate  aggressively,  in  plain  language,  key
facts, and rebut erroneous information about its hurricane to stake-
holders,  the  public,  and  then,  we  have  a  number  of  things  after
that.

DISCUSSION

NOAA’S REACTION TO THE PROBLEMS WITH DIRECTOR

PROENZA

Chairman  LAMPSON.  That  is  fine.  We  may  get  to  some  of  those
during  our  questioning,  and  I  appreciate  your  testimony.  We,  at
this  time,  will  go  into  our  rounds  of  questioning,  and  I  will  yield
myself five minutes.

Admiral  Lautenbacher,  when  did  you  learn  of  the  complaints

from the Center?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. I learned about the complaints on June
the 19th, in a phone call from Mary Glackin, who is the Acting Di-
rector of the Weather Service.

Chairman LAMPSON. Was it the day before you came to visit me?
Well,  actually,  the  day  before  you  came  to  visit  me,  Mr.  Proenza
and  the  Center  must  have  been  pretty  much  on  your  mind,  for  on
June 26, you sent a note over to the head of NIST, asking that Dr.
Turner be loaned to NOAA to head up a review team.

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  When  I  came  to  see  you,  we  were  very
concerned  about  the  personnel  issue  at  the  Hurricane  Center,  and
were working on ways to deal with it.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Was  the  communication  that  you  sent  on
that day the first communication between NOAA and NIST regard-
ing who might be detailed to such a team?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  The  first  communication,  I  think  was,
I  signed  on  June  26,  and  that  is  the  first  one  that  I  am  aware  of
at this point, that we, in order to set in motion the kinds of proce-
dures and process that was necessary, we needed to ensure that we
had  the  right  documents,  the  right  charge,  that  the  Team  agreed
with  it,  people  were  involved,  so  that  was  the  beginning  of  the
process.

Chairman LAMPSON. On that same day, you produced a brief out-
line  of  what  you  wanted  the  Team  to  review.  When  was  the  first
draft of that produced, and by whom?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  don’t  recall.  I  can  try  to  take  that  for

the record. It was certainly one of my staff.

Chairman LAMPSON. On June 26 also, you received legal author-
ity to take managerial actions against Mr. Proenza. Do you remem-
ber receiving that authority?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Yes,  I  do.  The  background  on  that  is
that the Secretary of Commerce holds the authority to reassign and
transfer members of the level of employment at which Mr. Proenza
is  at.  I  can’t  overemphasize  the  extraordinary  concerns  that  I  felt
from what Mary Glackin had relayed to me, and when I expressed
that to the Department, they felt that we needed to have a way to
ensure that if there were some immediate problems, that we would
have  some  way  to  deal  with  them.  It  was  clearly  a  backup  mecha-
nism  to  ensure  that  we  would  not  undermine  the  ability  of  that
team to function to forecast hurricanes.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  so,  while  you  were  working  to  put  to-
gether  the  team  that  will  get  to  the  bottom  of  the  situation  at  the
Center,  you  were  also  securing  the  authority  to  get  rid  of  or  reas-
sign Proenza. And yesterday, the staff were told by the head of the
review  team,  that  they  were  going  into  their  review  of  the  Hurri-

cane  Center  with  no  preconceived  notions.  That  doesn’t  seem  that
you shared that attitude. When did you first meet with the review
team?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  have  always  been  interested  in  a  fair
and  impartial  review  of  what  was  going  on  at  the  Hurricane  Cen-
ter, and I would ask you, you can ask Dr. Turner about his feeling
of  independence  or  not,  but  that  was  where  I  was  going.  I  have
never  been,  I  have  never  publicly  stated  or  been  involved  in  any
issues  other  than  trying  to  make  the  situation  such  that  Mr.
Proenza  could  succeed  in  his  task  as  the  head  of  the  Hurricane
Center.  As  I  said,  it  was  purely  a  backup  to  ensure  that  if  there
were some situation that came up, that we could move quickly, and
not undermine the capability of the Center.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Did  you  tell  them  that  you  had  sought  the

authority to transfer or reassign Mr. Proenza?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  don’t  recall  whether  I  told  them  that

Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  did  you  tell  them  about  him?  What

or not.

was your charge to them?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  My  charge  to  them  is  in  the  document
that  we  provided,  which  indicates  the  three  tasks  that  we  asked
them,  and  my  personal  conversations,  as  far  as  I  can  recall,  were
in  line  with  the  written  document  that  we  had  provided,  and  the
charge that we gave to the Team.

Chairman LAMPSON. I am going to yield back my time, and yield

time now to Chairman Miller.

THE PROENZA PLAN

Chairman  MILLER.  Good  afternoon.  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  you
said  that  you  first  heard  of  any  problems  at  the  Center  on  June
19.

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. There was an April 21 mail2 that spoke
of a five-step Proenza plan, and it said that you had asked for that.
What is the Proenza plan, what were the five steps? What was the
purpose of it? What was that all about?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  That  is  a  euphemism  for  us  trying  to
help  Bill  to  accommodate  to  his  new  position.  We  had  asked  and
talked  about,  and  I  can’t  expressly  remember  who  had  what  idea,
but  we  felt  the  following,  that  first  of  all,  he  is  in  a  new  position,
and for any employee, and certainly at the SES level, there is a re-
quirement that you have a performance plan, so that their progress
and  their  expectations  of  the  management  can  be  outlined  and
agreed to by the employee.

I  wanted  to  make  sure,  first  of  all,  confirmation  from  the  chain
of  command  that  that  was  in  place,  because  he  had  just  come  into
a new position from an older position, and that needed to be done.
The next step was that it was time for a mid-year review. You are
required to consult with your employees, and to have a face to face
meeting,  in  terms  of  telling  them  how  they  have  done,  where  they
are  going,  and  you  know,  advocating  what  needs  to  be  done  with
them. Those were two.

Three  was,  given  some  of  the  misleading  statements  that  had
been in the press, that we asked him to, I wanted the chain of com-
mand  to  provide  some  ethics  training.  And  four  was  to,  and  these
are  not,  there  is  no  five  step  program.  This  was  designed  to  give
him  the  material  and  tools  in  order  to  make  him  a  more  effective
Director.  Fourth  was  the  information  and  direct  connection  with
our  budget  activities,  so  that  he  would  have  full  and  free  access,
and  the  information  on  how  much  was  being  spent  on  various
issues,  and  particularly,  his  part  of  the  world.  And  then,  five  was
media training. He is responsible for his statements in public, and
is,  quite  frankly,  the  most  visible  spokesman  of  NOAA,  and  it  is
very important that he do that job well.

So, those were the five kinds of steps. They were designed to pro-

vide for him the tools to make him successful in the job.

Chairman MILLER. Why did you ask legal to look at it? The email

says Eddie said he wanted to get legal to look it over.

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Because I asked the HR folks, I wanted
to  make  sure,  I  am  very  deferential  to  protecting  the  rights,  as  a
career person myself, I am very deferential to protecting the rights
of career employees, making sure that we do not, management does
not  overstep  the  bounds  of  what  is  proper,  right  and  proper,  in
order to supervise and maintain adequate control and management
of  all  employees,  so  it  was  a  check  to  make  sure  that  we  were  not
overstepping any potential bounds.

NOAA DOCUMENTS

Chairman  MILLER.  There  have  been  no  subpoena  issues  by  this
committee.  We  have  described  to  NOAA  what  kinds  of  documents
we  want  provided.  We  got  700  pages  of  documents  last  night.  Ex-
cuse  me,  284.  You  have  mentioned  legal  here.  Of  course,  none  of
this is subject to a subpoena, but has NOAA provided all the docu-
ments that meet the description that we provided you, of the docu-
ments that we want? Have any been withheld on any claim of law-
yer-client  privilege  or  executive  privilege,  or  decisional  process
privilege, or Privacy Act privilege, or any other basis?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. None of that for the documents we pro-
vided, and I am certainly going to state, and that your staff knows,
we have not provided, we have not completed the document search.
We are working as quickly as we can to provide all of the informa-
tion  you  need.  We  want  to  cooperate  with  your  need  to  review  ev-
erything, and we are continuing to work on that as fast as we can.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. And we will continue to get documents

from you, then.

THE MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

Chairman  MILLER.  Fine.  The  way  that  this  management  assess-
ment  was  described,  or  as  Mr.  Proenza  learned  of  it,  was  that  he
got  a  call,  as  they  were  arriving,  from  you.  So,  that  was  the  first
he  learned  of  it,  that  other  employees  at  that  Center  knew  about
it, knew the Team was coming, but for him, they showed up at his
door, and that seems to be, apparently was intentional, a plan.

It  sounds  more  like  law  enforcement  serving  a  search  warrant

than a management assessment. Why was it done in that way?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  That  was  not  the  intention  at  all.  The
issue  was  to  try  to  protect  the  rights  of  both  Mr.  Proenza  and  the
employees.  I  am  not  aware  of  who  knew  or  didn’t  know  before
whatever,  but  I  know  that  arrangements  were  made  logistically  to
ensure  that  someone  knew  that  there  would  be  some  people  com-
ing, so that there would be someone to——

Chairman MILLER. But was there a decision, a conscious decision
that  Mr.  Proenza  would  not  know  that  there  was  a  management
assessment team on the way?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. There was a conscious decision to try to
make  this  as,  let  us  see,  what  is  the  right  term  here,  we  wanted
to  assess  the  situation  as  it  was.  We  were  very  concerned,  I  was
concerned, based on what I heard from Mary Glackin about repris-
als,  and  the  employees’  concerns,  so  the  issue  was  to  try  to,  to  the
best that we could, and this isn’t some big secret operation, this is
just to try to do it as a snapshot of the way this, the way the oper-
ation  functions,  and  to  do  it  in  a  way  that  didn’t  alarm  either  Mr.
Proenza or the employees. That was the intent.

Chairman MILLER. Have you sent in management teams in simi-
lar  circumstances,  and  not  told  the  head  of  the  office  that  they
were arriving until they were at his doorstep?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  have  not  done  that,  have  not  had  the
need  to  do  that  in  my  term  as  the  head  of  NOAA.  I  have  done  it
a  number  of  times  in  my  Navy  career,  and  it  is  a  normal  process
to  have  reviews  that  are  done  as  daily  business  is  occurring,  in
order  to  not  to  disrupt  the  command,  which  is  another  issue.  We
didn’t want them to spend a lot of time trying to prepare, and cre-
ate  a  great  deal  of,  perhaps,  consternation,  and  as  I  said,  concern
about  the  reaction  the  employees  would  have  if  Mr.  Proenza  and
they  were  trying  to  prepare  for  some,  and  again,  it  was  an  assess-
ment,  a  snapshot  assessment.  It  was  not  designed  in  any  other
way, except to uncover the facts.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  I  have  more  questions,  but  there  will

be an additional round. Mr. Inglis for five minutes.

COURSE OF ACTION TAKEN WITH DIRECTOR PROENZA

Mr.  INGLIS.  Admiral,  Chairman  Lampson  was  concerned  in  his
questions about why it was that you didn’t mention it, the pending
action involving the Team going in to see Mr. Proenza, at the time
that  you  met  with  him,  Chairman  Lampson.  Is  that,  in  retrospect,
a good decision on your part, or——

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  believe  so,  because  at  the  time,  we
had  not  completed  the  full  discussion  and  deliberation  process  to
make  a  final  decision  on  exactly  how  it  would  be  conducted,  try  to
ensure  protections  if  we  were  to  do  it,  and  exactly  when  we  would
do  it,  and  what  the  results,  the  plan  had  not  been  formulated  at
that point, when I saw the Chairman.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Now,  suppose,  my  take  on  that  if  it  is  a  personnel
matter,  it  is  really  not  ripe  for  discussion.  Is  that  right?  I  mean,
in  other  words,  we  don’t  exactly  discuss,  you  wouldn’t  naturally,
you  wouldn’t  take  it  upon  yourself  to  discuss  personnel  matters
that aren’t yet decided.

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. I would not do that as a normal course
of action. I did advise the Committee, and called, personally called
a number of people on Monday to tell them of what the issue was,
and  how  we  were  going  to  try  to  deal  with  it,  because  I  am  very
respectful  that  this  committee  needs  to  understand  what  is  going
on at an area as sensitive as the Hurricane Center.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  you  could  have  simply  terminated  Mr.  Proenza.

Is that correct?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  There  is  a  misunderstanding  here
about the authority. I don’t have any authority that is not granted
in the normal personnel regulations, that comes from the laws that
Congress  provides,  and  as  are  distributed  to  us  from  the  Office  of
Personnel  Management.  There  is  a  very  clear  procedure  that  one
must  go  through,  and  I  would  never,  in  my  wildest  imagination,
think  of  violating  any  due  process  and  procedures  in  providing  all
the  rights  that  accompany  that.  So,  I  was  not  interested  in  any-
thing to do with dismissal or removal at that point.

Mr. INGLIS. But sending in a team, was that required? Were you
required  to  send  in  an  assessment  team,  or  could  you  have  taken
more direct action if you wanted to, against Mr. Proenza?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  If  I  had  wanted  to,  I  could  have  taken
more  direct  action.  I  did  not  feel  it  was  appropriate  to  take  more
direct  action,  or  I  could  have  instituted  more  direct  action,  and
more respectfully. And remember that Mary actually recommended
that  more  direct  action  be  taken.  I  wanted  to  ensure  that
everybody’s rights were protected, Mr. Proenza’s, as well as the em-
ployees that work for him.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  Dr.  Turner,  in  retrospect,  would  you  think  it  is
the right decision to go without notice? Chairman Miller mentioned
that  concern,  that  it  was  without  notice  to  Mr.  Proenza  that  you
all  showed  up.  Is  that,  in  retrospect,  the  right  thing  to  do,  you
think, or——

Dr.  TURNER.  I  just  find  it  very  difficult  to  answer,  because  it  is
a  hypothetical,  and  I  have  not  thought  about  that,  and  I  don’t
know.  There  may  have  been  some  other  situations  and  cir-
cumstances that I was not aware of, and so, I would certainly not,
you know, based on what I knew, I would certainly not be in a po-
sition  to  second  guess  decisions  made  by  the  Admiral  or  anyone
else.

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah. Well, it seemed to me that actually, you would
want  to  go  in  quickly  and  without  notice.  And  I  know  that  Chair-
man  Miller  seems  to  think  that  is  untoward,  or  appears  to  think
it  is  untoward.  I  would  think  that  is  exactly  what  is  indicated  in
the circumstances, because otherwise, you put everybody on notice,
they are going to go around getting their stories together. They are
going  to  spend  time  of  the  agency  developing  arguments,  rather
than keeping on doing their work, and let us just come in here and
check and see what is happening here. So, it seems to me a rather
reasonable decision.

Also, I am almost out of time, but it appears to me, Admiral, you
have had a lot of experience in the Navy, and I would assume that
the  teacher  analogy  you  may  have  heard,  that  I  used  out  in  the
hallway  with  some  teachers,  that  the  great,  that  the  person  that
is  best  at  being  the  elementary  school  principal  may  not  be  the

same  person  that  performs  well  at  the  district  office,  and  vice
versa.

I  suppose  that  has  been  your  experience,  and  I  hope  that  some-
how,  we  leave  here  having  delved,  unfortunately,  rather  publicly,
into  a  personnel  matter  that  may  damage  the  reputation  of  Mr.
Proenza in the end, but he could be restored as somebody that can
perform  well  in  a  number  of  circumstances,  and  maybe  just  didn’t
fit in this. Is that how you think this might, this footnote in history
be written?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Obviously, I can’t describe what actions
I  am  going  to  take,  because  I  haven’t  gotten  the  recommendations
that  I  have  asked  for  from  my  deputy.  But  my  track  record,  and
you  can  ask  many  people,  has  been  always  to  try  to  ensure  that
people are in the right billets, that they are given the opportunities
to  perform  at  their  highest  level.  I  believe  in  the  inherent  dignity
and  rights  of  every  individual,  and  I  have  always  worked  to  try  to
put people in the right jobs, and to ensure their success, and I will
continue to do that.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Admiral.
Chairman MILLER. Mr. Diaz-Balart.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Admiral,  how  are

you, sir?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. I am fine. Thank you, sir.

WITNESS BACKGROUND

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Admiral,  just  for  my  information,  you  know,
we  call  you  Admiral,  but,  because  you  were  an  Admiral,  and  obvi-
ously, you still have the title. How long were you in the Navy?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. I was in the Navy for 40 years.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Forty  years.  That  is  kind  of  a  small  mom  and
pop  operation,  right?  The  Navy,  you  didn’t  have  to  supervise  a  lot
of people then, did you?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  have  had  experience  at  all  levels  in

supervising, small groups to very large groups.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you for your service to the country, that
you continue to do. Mr. Turner, Dr. Turner, I was also, by the way,
it  is  just  when  I  was  looking  at  your  resume,  sir,  it  is  pretty  im-
pressive.  I  just  think  it  is  good  for  us  to  hear  this.  I  might  embar-
rass  you,  because  I  know  you  are,  but  I  just,  you  know,  when  you
have  got  people  of  this  caliber  in  front  of  you,  I  think  it  is  impor-
tant  to  say  this  is  a  man  who  has  received  the  U.S.  Government
Presidential  Rank  Award  for  Meritorious  Service,  three  times  re-
ceived  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  Exceptional  Service  Award,
earned the Secretary of Energy Gold Award, and the National Nu-
clear Security Administration’s Gold Medal.

It  is  a  privilege  to  be  in  your  presence,  sir,  and  to  both  of  your

presence.

Dr. TURNER. Thank you very much, sir.

RESPONSIBILITIES AS A SUPERVISOR

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  You  know,  we  have  something  here  that  is
kind of almost, I guess, without precedent. I don’t know how many
times,  I  have  never,  I  have  only  been  in  Congress  for  a  few  years.

It is only my third term, but I don’t—Dr. Turner or Admiral, have
you  all  ever  been  in  a  position  where  half  of  the  staff  publicly
manifests  itself  against  a  supervisor,  publicly,  and  even  with  the
press?  Is  that  something  normal?  Again,  as  a  rookie,  I  am,  you
know,  I  just,  is  that  something  that  happens  a  lot  in  the  Federal
Government?

Dr.  TURNER.  I  have  had  about  30  years  in  the  Federal  Govern-
ment,  and  I  have  not  run  into  that  type  of  situation,  where  there
has been a public outcry such as that.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Dr.  Turner,  in  your  years  of  being  a  super-
visor,  if  however  something  like  that  would  have  happened,  would
you have thought it would have been responsible to not act and try
to  find  out  what  is  going  on,  and  kind  of  ignore  the  situation,  and
not  try  to  come  up  with  a  way  to  try  to  figure  out  what  is  wrong,
or you know, what is going on?

Dr.  TURNER.  Yes,  sir.  I  think  it  is  part  of  the  responsibility  of  a
supervisor,  and  also,  I  think  in  some  cases  similar  to  this,  the  dif-
ficulty  is  getting  employees  to  speak  on  the  record.  That  often  is
difficult,  because  one  cannot  act  unless  they  go  on  record,  because
it  is  not  fair  to  the  person  being  accused,  and  it  is  also  not  fair  to
the person who ultimately has to make a decision. And it is not fair
to  the  employees  expecting  something  to  happen,  but  they  need  to
go on record, and I think these people went on record, and I think,
again——

ADMIRAL LAUTENBACHER’S ACTIONS

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  That  is  pretty  clear.  Admiral,  let  me—if  I
sound critical, I just learned now that you could have, once you got
the  information  from  Acting  Secretary  Glackin,  you  could  have,  on
your  own,  acted  to,  you  know,  move  Mr.  Proenza.  And  yet,  what
you  did  instead  is  you  created  this,  you  asked  people  to  go  in  and
look  at  what  is  going  on.  Would  it  not  be,  frankly,  a  fair  criticism
saying  that,  knowing  of  the  importance  of  the  Hurricane  Center,
that  we  are  now  in  the  middle  of  a  hurricane  season,  that  you
frankly  were  not  aggressive  enough,  and  didn’t  act  quick  enough,
because of what is at stake here? I mean, isn’t that a fair criticism,
to say that maybe you were not aggressive and quick enough?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  That  is  a  fair  criticism,  and  I  have
thought  long  and  hard  about  that,  too,  and  tried  to  find  the  right
compromise  to  ensure  rights  were  protected,  and  that  we  were
doing the right thing for the American people. It is a very difficult
decision.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. And within that decision, Admiral, so you were
aware of the importance of the Hurricane Center, and the fact that
we  are  in  a  hurricane  season,  and  yet,  you  still  thought  that  you
would  be  a  little  bit  slower,  and  I  guess  a  little  bit  more  delibera-
tive, and you actually got this group of individuals, I already men-
tioned some of the awards that Dr. Turner has earned. So, you ob-
viously  found  a  pretty  qualified  group  of  individuals,  and  you  did
not just act, you actually, what, you wanted to make sure that Mr.
Proenza  and  the  individuals,  the  highly  qualified  scientists  and
others at the Hurricane Center, had the ability to really, what, air
it  out  without  fear  of  retribution?  Is  that  what  you  did,  even
though,  knowing  that  you  would  have  had  to  slow  down  in  order

to  do  that?  Even  though  we  are  in  the  middle  of  a  hurricane  sea-
son?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  did,  and  I  felt  that  if  there  were  any
indications, first of all, I watched the weather situation very close-
ly, because I was not going to do this in a period when we had seri-
ous  tropical  activity,  and  needed  to  have  full  efforts  placed  on  the
hurricane forecasting, so that was part of the decision as well.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you,  Admiral.  So  again,  and  I  am,  you
know,  I  am  not  being  critical,  but  I  just  want  to  make  sure  that
it is very clear that you could have done it quicker. You could have
done it without Dr. Turner and other career service, frankly, heroes
to  our  nation,  looking  at  this,  but  you  didn’t,  even  though  we  are
in the hurricane season, and I guess what, and I just want to make
sure I understand this, because you just wanted to make sure that
it  was  done  right,  not  necessarily  done  as  quickly  as  possible,  but
done  right,  and  even  knowing  that  that,  in  itself,  you  could  have
been accused, you could be accused, I mean, I guess someone might
say  that  I  am,  of  not  doing  it  as  quick  as  you  could  have  done,
knowing the fact that it is not usual for people in the Federal Gov-
ernment,  half  the  employees,  to  publicly  say  we  want  this  indi-
vidual to go?

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. That is correct.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you,  Admiral.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair-

man.

Chairman MILLER. Thank you. Mr. Klein for five minutes.

MORE ON QUIKSCAT

Mr. KLEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
Admiral, and thank you, Dr. Turner for your service. We appreciate
it.

I  am  not  going  to  spend  my  time  on  the  personnel  issues,  other
than just to say that the reason probably that this is going on right
now  is  because  there  are  probably  some  statements  made,  when
Mr.  Proenza  brought  forth  his  comments  on  QuikSCAT  from
NOAA. There is probably some personnel management issues with-
in, that certainly have left some smoking guns out there for people
to make these situations.

I  have  heard  what  you  all  said  today.  I  appreciate  the  process
you  went  through.  It  probably  stirred  some  things  up  down  there,
and  maybe  that  was  the  right  thing  to  do,  to  get  to  the  bottom  of
it.  I  agree  this  is  the  middle  of  the  hurricane  season.  Those  of  us
who live in Florida and other places around the country, we are as
concerned, and I appreciate your closing statement there, about the
responsibilities that NOAA and the Hurricane Center and the per-
sonnel  take  extremely  seriously,  and  I  appreciate  that,  because  I
don’t question any of that.

I  am  going  to  go  back  to  QuikSCAT,  and  go  back  to  the  equip-
ment and the tools and those kinds of things. I am fairly convinced
that  there  is  some  relevance  to  QuikSCAT,  based  on  what  I  have
heard  up  to  this  point,  whether  it  is  marine  activities,  or  whether
it  is  some  level  of  evaluation  tool  that  is  used  by  the  forecasters.
When  I  went  down  to  the  Hurricane  Center,  they  specifically  told
me  that  it  has  some  relevance.  Whether  it  is  15  percent,  or  some

contribution, I think we all agree that the more tools, and the more
information on the table, the better the analysis can be.

122

And the question that I asked, you know, your organization early
on,  when  I  started  raising  some  issues  about  this,  is  what  is  the
backup,  which  I  now  believe  is,  you  know,  being  thoroughly  evalu-
ated.  I  was  concerned  it  wasn’t  for  as  long  as  it  should  have  been,
and  I  hope  that  we  have  all  learned  that  process  since  then,  that
we should be in a better position, and continue to move along, and
I  want  to  encourage  that,  so  that  we,  if  this  thing  does  fail,  when-
ever it fails, that we really have all the tools in place.

We  have  had  some  other  testimony  today  about  this,  and  just
give me your sense of, your professional sense of if it does fail, you
know,  how  far  off  are  we,  in  terms  of  you  are  recognizing  yes,  we
have  most  of  what  we  need,  but  how  far  off  are  we,  and  are  you
satisfied  that  between  the  various  tracking  tools  we  have,  that  we
are going to be in a sufficient position?

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Yes,  thank  you,  and  I  appreciate  your
comments.  First  of  all,  let  me  caveat.  I  am  trained  as  a  scientist,
and I consider myself a scientist, but in this role, I am a manager,
so I take the advice of my practicing scientists, and so, that is what
you  are  hearing,  that  temporized  through  my  interpretation  as  a
scientist.

But  I  view  the  QuikSCAT  as  a  very  important  instrument,  be-
cause  it  brings  the  surface  vector  wind  field.  I  won’t  say  it  is  the
Holy  Grail  of  forecasting,  but  it  is  a  really  nice  thing  to  have.  As
a fluid dynamicist, I would like to have, that is an important vari-
able.

We  had  planned,  obviously,  for  many  years  before  QuikSCAT
was determined to be so effective, which happened in the last year
or two, that we got into that, to use conical microwave imaging and
sounding to provide those variables, those fields. So, we are at the
cutting  edge,  kind  of,  of  instrumentation  to  provide  this  surface
vector  wind  field.  We  have  been  using  the  QuikSCAT  information,
that  is  an  experimental  satellite,  that  had  been  built  by  NASA.  It
has  been  working  fine,  and  we  expect  it  to  keep  working.  I  will
keep  my  fingers  crossed,  but—and  so,  I  view  that,  for  this  season,
we are in good shape.

We  have  put  on,  in  our  partnership  with  Europe,  we  have
EUMETSAT,  a  polar  orbiting  satellite  that  has  something  called
ASCAT on it, which is a scatterometer, an active instrument. It is,
on  specs,  not  quite  as  good  as  the  QuikSCAT  scatterometer,  but
that now is operating, and is in place, and it will be here until 2020
continuously. I have directed, and I am sure you are aware of that,
that  that  be  taken  into  account  and  looked  at,  and  put  into  the
models,  to  see  how  much  of  a  difference  that  would  make  in  a
model,  and  remember,  we  are  talking  about  a  model,  not  nec-
essarily,  remember,  forecasts  are  made  by  forecasters,  not  by  com-
puters. It is still an art, in a sense.

And  so,  that  system  is  in  place,  but  in  addition  to  that,  we  con-
tinue to put in place one improvement after another. This year, we
are putting seven new hurricane buoys in place. It will be a ground
truth  on  the  surface  of  the  ocean.  Never  had  that  before.  We  have
more accurate wind measurement instruments going on our Hurri-
cane Hunter aircraft, which are very important for landfalling hur-

fact,  remember,  the
scatterometer  is  most  useful  for  hurricanes  that  are  away  from
land,  and  for  tropical  storms,  basically,  not  landfalling  hurricanes,
because of the speed limitation on QuikSCAT.

important.  In 

So,  there  is  a  number  of  issues.  I  can  keep  going  on,  but  I  am

afraid that I am going——

Mr.  KLEIN.  That  is  okay,  and  I  am  aware  of  where  I  am  going

with this.

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  It  is  not  part  of  what  this  hearing  is.

NEXT GENERATION FORECASTING TOOLS

Mr. KLEIN. Where I am going with this, and this is part of where
I am interested in, and I think Members of Congress are, is wheth-
er  we  have  the  adequate  tools  in  place,  and  you  know,  there  is  a
history  that,  I  am  a  new  Member  of  Congress,  but  there  is  a  his-
tory,  apparently,  the  last  number  of  years,  of  a  lot  of  money  that
was  put  down  the  drain,  in  a  technology  that  has  not  gotten  us
where  we  wanted  to  be,  and  that  was  sort  of  going  to  be  the  next
generation  of  where  we  are  going  with  some  of  the,  you  know,
equipment.

So,  I  want  to  be  supportive.  I  know  Members  want  to  be  sup-
portive  of  giving  you  the  tools,  including  research,  so  I  am  inter-
ested  in  knowing,  on  the  research  side,  you  know,  what  connects
we  need,  where  do  we  need  to  be  helpful,  but  at  the  same  time,
there  has  got  to  be  a  good,  frank,  honest,  and  open  relationship
with the Congress and the American people, to make sure that, you
know, we have the backing of the taxpayers, to know we are doing
the right thing.

But we have to have this, and it is very important that whether
it is QuikSCAT or anything else, I don’t want to hear a month ago
oh  well,  it  is  very  important,  very  important,  and  all  of  a  sudden,
with  Mr.  Proenza’s  situation  in  the  middle  of  this,  it  is  not  impor-
tant, it is not important, it is not important. And then, I hear some
backtracking  from  some  folks.  That  is  the  credibility  gap  that  has
developed  out  of  this  whole  dynamic,  which  I  think  needs  to  be
flushed out and gotten off the table, and we need to move on.

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Can  I  make  just  two  comments,  and  I
know  Dr.  Turner  is  interested?  First  of  all,  I  know  it  was  just  a
euphemism,  but  I  do  not  believe  money  has  been  poured  down  a
rat  hole  on  the  satellite  programs.  What  we  have  is  a  problem
where  the  technical  difficulties  involved  in  creating  the  next  gen-
eration  of  instruments  took  more  time  and  more  money  than  any-
body ever anticipated to deliver, so we have had to reduce some of
the risk on that, so that we have the schedule, and they can be de-
livered. That has been. That is back on track. So, that is good.

Now,  QuikSCAT  is  a  potential  filler  of  this  surface  vector  wind
field,  we  have  pushed  money  in  the  direction.  We  have  a  study
going. We are trying to look at a replacement for QuikSCAT based
on the renewed, or I would say, probably new interest that it is the
only, or it is the best replacement for that field, as a matter of pri-
ority. And we are working on that with a study, and we will make
decisions  as  quickly  as  we  can  make  them  responsibly,  and  come
to you as the Oversight Committee, and say this is the right place
to invest money.

Mr. KLEIN. Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Turner,  you  can  respond  to  that.  We  are

getting close to the end, but go ahead, Dr. Turner.

Dr. TURNER. Yes, sir. I think the discussion about QuikSCAT has
two  dimensions,  and  certainly,  one  dimension  that  has  been  dis-
cussed  quite  a  bit  here,  and  that  is  the  scientific  dimension,  and
certainly, dialogue and discussion about the science and so forth of
QuikSCAT  and  its  replacement,  are  certainly  ripe  fields  for  people
to talk about.

I  think  what  concerned  us  in  our  assessment  was  the  misrepre-
sentation  that  Mr.  Proenza  made  about  the,  about  what  his  staff
was  telling  him  about  QuikSCAT  and  its  importance  to  them  and
their  forecasting.  We  were  told  on  several  occasions  that  his  staff
corrected his statements, told him why they thought that they were
being  taken  out  of  context,  and  he  continued  to  misrepresent  their
views, and I think that is the part that made them lose confidence
in his integrity.

Mr.  KLEIN.  Mr.  Chairman.  Just  for  the  record,  and  I  know  my
time is up, for the record, I did go down to the National Hurricane
Center,  as  I  said  before.  I  asked  two  specific  forecasters,  veteran
forecasters, specifically about the statements that Mr. Proenza was
making,  and  they  validated  them  independently.  It  was  just  a  pri-
vate  conversation,  but  I  was  interested,  and  just  they  showed  me,
and  they  said  yeah,  this  is  true,  and  this  is  what  the  value  is.  So,
I don’t know what has been said since then, but it was a firsthand
expression  to  me,  and  I  know  that  was  there.  Now,  what  has  hap-
pened  since  then,  and  different  people  can  have  different  opinions,
but I want to put that on the record.

Chairman MILLER. Dr. Turner, you can complete your statement.
Dr. TURNER. It is fine.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. All right. I know that there are further
questions that I have, but we have spent the better part of the day
in  this  hearing.  We  have  more  documents  to  receive.  Mr.  Diaz-
Balart.

ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  And  thank  you,  and  Mr.  Chairman,  you  have
been  very  generous,  and  also,  I  will  be  quick,  but  I  do  think  it  is
one  of  the  things  that  I  wish  in  hindsight,  well,  even  though  we
asked  for  it,  it  would  have  been  helpful,  in  order  to  clarify  some
of  these  questions,  to  get  others  to  testify.  None  of  those  people
that Congressman Klein and I spoke to on all sides of these issues
were  frankly  invited  to  be  up  here,  and  I  think  that  is  frankly  a
little bit of a disservice, but again, I am not here to point a finger.
I  just  want  to  make  that  point,  that  I  think  it  would  have  been  a
more  helpful,  since  we  are,  unfortunately,  I  guess,  going  to  con-
tinue  to  try  again  to  push  personnel  issues  as  Members  of  Con-
gress.  If  we  are  going  to  do  that,  at  least  it  would  have  been  nice
to have all of the people involved, and not just some.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman MILLER. Well, under our rules, the Minority is allowed
to bring witnesses, and have. I think Dr. Turner is a witness of the
Minority.

125

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman.  We  brought  him.  We,

again——

Chairman MILLER. We will continue to——
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. He would have been good to have——
Chairman MILLER. It is almost certain that we will have another
hearing  on  this  topic,  since  we  still  do  not  have  all  of  the  docu-
ments. And that is, let me take back the implication that that was
a criticism. I know we have asked, with a very short time, for docu-
ments.  We  do  need  the  documents.  We  do  need  to  look  at  this.
Now,  the  Minority  has  said  that  for  us  to  look  at  this  is  simply  a
personnel  issue,  but  for  you  to  look  at  was  the  Lord’s  own  work,
that you had to look at it, you had to make sure that the National
Hurricane Center, the Hurricane Center was doing its work.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. That is their job.
Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  agreed.  It  is  also  our  job  in  exercising
oversight  to  know  what  goes  on.  And  they  are,  I  began  this  hear-
ing,  and  I  know  that  Mr.  Lampson  wishes  to  make  a  final  remark
as well. I began this hearing saying I did not know what had hap-
pened  at  that  hearing.  Mr.  Inglis  has  used  the  phrase,  the  Major-
ity’s  theory  of  the  case.  This  isn’t  a  case,  I  don’t  have  a  theory.  I
want to know what has happened.

This exploded into national attention a couple weeks ago. I think
we  all  found  out  about  it  at  the  same  time.  I  think  we  all  see  this
as  important.  It  is  important.  It  is  important  to  our  role  as  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee  that  has  oversight  jurisdiction  of  NOAA,  of
the  Hurricane  Center,  to  find  out  what  is  going  on.  And  there  is
a lot more that I want to know.

There will be other witnesses. As I pointed out earlier this week,
in a hearing of these two subcommittees, I don’t want to hear com-
plaints at the hearing about the procedures that we are using when
there  has  been  ample  opportunity,  leading  up  to  the  hearing,  to
talk  about  it.  If  there  are  witnesses  that  the  Minority  wishes  to
call,  let  us  know  about  it.  Our  staffs  are  in  constant  contact.  The
Members know how to talk to each other as well.

Members  can  get  the  cell  phone  numbers  of  other  Members.  My
home  telephone  number  in  Raleigh  is  in  the  phonebook.  I  am  visi-
ble  on  the  floor,  we  can  find  each  other,  and  to  hear  about,  hear
complaints of the procedures of the Committee, about who we have
called  or  not  called  at  the  hearing,  does  make  me  wonder  if  the
purpose  of  the  complaints  is  simply  to  distract  attention  from  the
subject of the hearing.

There  are  still  questions  that  I  have.  The  Minority  has  drawn
out,  in  its  questioning,  the  question  about  whether  Mr.  Proenza
would  retaliate  against  anyone,  and  that  is  why  this  management
team needed to show up unannounced, which I am sure felt, to all
the  employees  there,  like  law  enforcement  serving  a  search  war-
rant.  I  do  not  think  that  is  an  ordinary  procedure.  The  ordinary
way  that  a  management  team  comes  in  to  look  at  how  an  office,
a center is being run.

MORE ON STATE OF HURRICANE FORECASTING

There has been disputed question here about how well we are in-
tegrating  the  best  science  into  our  forecasting.  I  have  heard,  like
Mr.  Klein,  not  in  anticipation  of  this  hearing,  not  with  somebody,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:48 Jul 06, 2008 Jkt 036736 PO 00000 Frm 00131 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\071907\36736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

126

from  someone  with  any  axe  to  grind,  but  someone  with  expertise
in  atmospheric  research,  in  meteorological  research,  who  has  told
me  that  the  forecasting  by  the  Hurricane  Center  is  not  what  it
should  be.  It  is  not  what  we  should  expect  with  where  science  is
today,  and  particularly,  as  others  have  pointed  out  since  I  raised
the issue, intensification, intensity of hurricanes, forecasting inten-
sity is not what it should be.

I  have  also  heard  inland  flooding,  forecasts  of  inland  flooding  is
far  short  of  what  it  should  be.  Virtually  all  the  lives  lost  in  my
state  from  hurricanes  in  the  last  few  years  have  been  from  inland
flooding.  If  we  can  be  much  better  at  that,  as  I  have  been  told  we
can be, we should be, and I want to make sure yes, there are some
parallels  here  to  the  case  of  Moose  Cobb,  the  Inspector  General  at
NASA.

When an important agency of government appears to melt down,
it  is  appropriate  for  us  to  look  at  what  has  happened.  Was  it  the
case that there was resistance at the Center to changes that need-
ed  to  happen  to  improve  the  science,  to  do  a  better  job  of  fore-
casting? Is that what happened?

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Would the gentleman yield?
Chairman MILLER. Well, in a moment, I will.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you, sir.
Chairman MILLER. In a moment.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  We  welcome,  we  depend  upon  critics  within
government  to  tell  us  what  is  going  on.  Our  job  of  oversight  de-
pends  upon  people  within  the  government,  employees  speaking
freely to us, to tell us what questions to raise. There is no question
that  Mr.  Proenza  was  a  critic,  was  willing  to  speak  his  mind,  was
willing  to  stand  up  to  superiors  in  this  department,  in  NOAA,  in
the Weather Service.

We  certainly—it  is  certainly  appropriate  to  look  at  whether  that
is  part  of  what  happened  here.  Was  this  genuinely  a  revolt  by
those  below  him,  or  was  this  something  provoked  by  those  above
him in the hierarchy? Those are all the questions that I still have,
that this hearing has not answered, and we still have a good many
more documents to be provided.

I know Mr. Lampson wishes to be recognized, so let me recognize

Mr. Diaz-Balart first, and then, Mr. Lampson.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  again.

You are very kind to recognize me.

You  know,  I  don’t  disagree  with  a  lot  of  your  questions,  and  I
think  the  issue,  as  to  whether  we  are  getting  the  best  forecasting
available  is  something  that  this  committee  needs  to  look  at,  and
needs  to  continue  to  look  at.  Obviously,  I  question  whether  we
should be dealing in the personnel issue, but if we are going to, and
that  is  okay,  because  you  are  Chair  of  the  Subcommittee,  so  you
can do what you would like.

It  would  just  seem  to  me,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  there  are  some
things  that  shouldn’t  be  partisan.  For  example,  if  we  are  going  to
be looking at what happened in this particular case, it would seem

127

to  me  that  the  Majority  would  want  to  get  as  many  witnesses  on
all sides.

Chairman MILLER. Would the gentleman yield on that?
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Of course, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  Will  you  have  any  objection  to  our  bringing

employees of the National Hurricane Center here?

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Absolutely not. I don’t think——
Chairman  MILLER.  Or  taking  our  committee  there  to,  or  to  take

our committee there to have a field hearing?
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. If I may, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman MILLER. It is your time.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you.  You  know,  I  am  not  one  to  object

to what the Majority wants to do. My statement.

Chairman  MILLER.  Then  we  will  assume  that  there  won’t  be  an

objection.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Well,  my  statement  would  be,  though,  how-
ever,  twofold,  that  we  should  clearly  not  do  anything  that  is  going
to  jeopardize  the  ability  of  the  forecasters  in  the  heart  of  a  hurri-
cane  season  to  do  their  job.  I  think  we  are  already  doing  that  as
it  is,  and  I  think  it  would  be  highly  irresponsible,  borderline  neg-
ligence  for  us  to  continue  to  ask,  not  NOAA,  continue  to  ask  the
Hurricane  Center  people  to,  you  know,  spend  their  time  doing
things  that  are  not  just  looking  for  hurricanes,  number  one.  After
the  hurricane  season  is  over,  I  think  we  should  spend  as  much
time,  that  would  be  a  privilege  and  an  honor  to  have  you  all  in
Miami, and I think you would be highly impressed.

I  just  do  want  to  mention,  though,  that,  and  again,  you  know,  I
am  not  crying  over  spilled  milk,  but  we  brought  this  up,  but  this
was  brought  up,  that  we  only  had,  I  understand  how  the  rules
work,  we  had  one,  to  have  one  witness.  It  would  seem  to  me  that
this should not be partisan, that if the Majority wants to learn the
facts,  it  shouldn’t  have  to  be  a  Minority  witness.  It  should  be  the
witnesses  that  are  available,  to  find  out  what  the  facts  are,  and  it
is just, frankly, a little disheartening that such, and I, look, it may
be a little personal, and please bear with me.

The men and women in the Hurricane Center are incredible pro-
fessionals, incredible professionals. You don’t know them personally
like  I  do.  And  when  those  people  speak  out,  and  then,  this  com-
mittee has a hearing to find out why they spoke out, and what hap-
pened,  and  they  are  not  invited,  it  is  frankly  sad.  It  really  is  sad,
and  again,  we  had  one  witness,  we  got  it.  It  would  have  been  nice
for the Majority to at least have the intention of, if you were trying
to find out what is happening, you had Mr. Proenza. He is a great
guy.  I  am  glad  he  was  here.  How  is  it  possible  to  not  call,  I  am
confused, how is it possible to not call some of those 20 plus people
to have them up here?

Chairman MILLER. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Yes, sir. Of course.
Chairman  MILLER.  Do  you  know  that  we  did  call  the  staff,  and

that we did speak?

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. No, actually not at the Hurricane Center.
Chairman MILLER. And called them as——
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Not at the Hurricane Center. And we——

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Well,  it  is,  as  Mr.  Diaz-Balart,  as  you  have

pointed out, it is the middle of the hurricane season now.

Chairman  MILLER.  Generally,  the  Chair  welcomes  Mr.  Diaz-
Balart’s  suggestion  that  this  committee  have  a  field  hearing  in
Miami, and say December or January.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, you are a wise man.
Chairman  MILLER.  The  Chair  welcomes  bipartisan  contributions

such as that. And Mr. Lampson.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  think  that  I  got  my  question  answered
about  support  for  the  hearing,  and  your  support  for  having  the
right  people  come  up  here.  That  is  there  or  here.  Doesn’t  matter,
but the point is we——

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  After  the  hurricane  season,  right,  Mr.  Chair-

man?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  need  to  have  those  things.  I  would  like
to just mention, in my part of closing, that we did ask for some spe-
cific  staff,  high  ranking  assistants  to  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  to  at-
tend  today.  And  granted,  it  was  not  done  by  letter.  There  was  an
understanding  when  staff  asked,  I  think  that  is  an  inappropriate
request.  In  the  future,  we  would  like  for  that  certainly  to  be  hon-
ored.  We  don’t,  again,  don’t  think  that  it  is  inappropriate  to  do  so,
in matter.

With that, Mr. Chairman, I will yield back my time, and I thank

the panel for being here.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  also  thank  the  panel  for  being  here,  and  I
appreciate what I expect to be continued cooperation with the Com-
mittee  on  this  issue.  I  thank  everyone  for  being  here,  and  with
that, the hearing is adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 2:06 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
