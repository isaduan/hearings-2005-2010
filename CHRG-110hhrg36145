Potential Issues

The following are some of the potential issues that might be raised at the hearing:

What is the future direction of NASA’s Earth Science program?

• The  authors  of  the  recently  released  National  Academies’  report,  Earth
Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  National  Imperatives  for  the  Next  Dec-
ade  and  Beyond  (the  ‘‘decadal  survey’’)  found  that  ‘‘The  NASA/NOAA  Earth
Observation Satellite system, launched at the turn of the millennium, is aging
and the existing plan for the future is entirely inadequate to meet the coming
challenges.’’ (Attachment 1) Over the last two years, for example, several mis-
sions or instruments that were planned to study the climate, weather, precipi-
tation,  and  land  cover  changes  have  been  descoped,  delayed,  on  the  brink  of
cancellation, or canceled. Examples of these decisions are listed below and in
Attachment 2.

Æ Deep Space Climate Observatory (decision not to launch)
Æ Hydros mission to measure soil moisture (canceled)
Æ Global Precipitation Mission (delayed)
Æ National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System

(NPOESS) (descoped and delayed)

Æ Glory (delayed)
Æ Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  (changing  acquisition  approaches,  pos-

sible data gaps)

The  authoring  committee  recommended  a  set  of  observing  systems  and  sup-
porting  research  and  technology  elements  needed  to  meet  the  high  priority
Earth science and socioeconomic challenges that face our planet over the next

decade. The committee estimated that returning to the FY 2000 budget level
for NASA’s Earth science and applications program—approximately $2 billion
per  year—would  be  sufficient  for  building  the  recommended  program.  (At-
tachment  3)  The  President’s  FY  2008  budget  request  for  NASA’s  Earth
science  and  applications  program  and  the  projections  through  FY  2012,  how-
ever,  do  not  include  resources  for  initiating  the  future  missions  or  research
activities  recommended  in  the  decadal  survey.  What  is  NASA’s  plan  for  im-
plementing the Earth sciences decadal survey and what is the timeline? What
future  direction  will  NASA’s  Earth  science  and  applications  program  take
given  the  available  resources?  Which  of  the  decadal  survey  priorities  will  be
addressed and what observations will be made?

How  Important  Are  Observations  from  NASA’s  Earth  Science  Missions  to
the Nation’s and the World’s Overall Climate Research Efforts?

• The  recent  release  of  the  Fourth  Assessment  Report  of  the  International
Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  Working  Group  I  found  that  the  climate  is
warming  and  the  catalysts  for  that  warming  are  due,  in  part,  to  human  con-
tributions of greenhouse gases to the Earth’s atmosphere. To what extent did
data  from  NASA  Earth  observing  satellites  contribute  to  the  IPCC  assess-
ment  and  which  missions  recommended  in  the  Earth  science  decadal  survey
can help reduce uncertainties mentioned in the report? At the national level,
an  ‘‘Overview  of  U.S.  Research  in  Climate  and  Global  Change,’’  noted  that
‘‘The  USGCRP  [U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program]  and  Climate  Change
Research  Initiative  (CCRI)  will  place  major  emphasis  on  requirements-driven
specification of comprehensive observing systems. . ..’’ The attributes of those
systems would include:

Æ ‘‘Development  of  new  observing  capabilities  to  illuminate  Earth  system
processes  and  increase  spatial,  temporal,  or  spectral  resolution  where
needed to reduce key uncertainties in climate change and address emerg-
ing Earth science questions. . ..

Æ Special  emphasis  on  the  complex  observations  and  monitoring  systems

needed to analyze terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem variability.’’

Are  NASA’s  plans  for  Earth  Science  and  Applications  consistent  with  the
goals  set  out  in  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  and  Climate
Change  Research  Initiative?  How  important  are  NASA’s  Earth  observation
satellites  to  the  Nation’s  and  the  world’s  climate  research  efforts?  What  per-
centage  of  the  world’s  space-based  climate  monitoring  is  performed  by
NASA’s  Earth  observing  sensors?  What  percentage  of  the  Nation’s  and  the
world  expenditures  on  climate  research  does  NASA’s  contribution  represent?
What  is  the  potential  impact  on  plans  and  policies  for  adapting  to  climate
change if new observing systems are not developed?

• Leadership in Future Earth Sciences and Applications Activities

According  to  the  decadal  survey,  ‘‘Sustained  multi-decadal,  global  measure-
ments and data management of quantities that are key to understanding the
state  of  the  climate  and  the  changes  taking  place  are  crucial.’’  Sustaining
multi-decadal  measurements  requires  commitment  and  leadership,  as  noted
by  the  survey’s  call  for  the  U.S.  Government  to  restore  leadership  in  Earth
sciences  and  applications.  In  a  recent  interview  on  National  Public  Radio’s
(NPR)  Morning  Edition  program,  the  NASA  Administrator  said,  ‘‘I  have  no
doubt  that. . .a  trend  of  global  warming  exists.  I  am  not  sure  that  it  is  fair
to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with.’’ NASA’s own scientists use
NASA  Earth  observation  data  to  research  Earth’s  climate.  Dr.  Griffin  has
since  apologized  for  his  remarks  on  NPR  to  employees  at  the  Jet  Propulsion
Laboratory,  yet  his  statements  are  leading  some  people  to  question  NASA’s
commitment to leadership in climate monitoring and Earth science. How com-
mitted  are  the  agency  and  the  nation  to  ensuring  U.S.  leadership  in  Earth
sciences  and  applications?  To  what  degree  will  leaders  commit  to  multi-
decadal, global measurements of the Earth system?

How Well Balanced is the NASA Earth Sciences Program?

• The  National  Academies’  decadal  survey  emphasized  that  NASA’s  Earth
science  and  applications  program  must  be  balanced  across  scientific  dis-
ciplines  within  Earth  system  science;  across  mission  sizes  (small,  medium,
and large); technology maturity; and between observations and analysis, mod-
eling, and applications. Does NASA agree with this definition of balance? How
well  is  NASA’s  current  Earth  science  and  applications  program  balanced  ac-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

5

cording  to  these  elements?  What  performance  measures  might  be  used  to  as-
sess balance within and among NASA’s Earth science program elements?

Æ Importance  of  the  Grants  Program  (Research  and  Analysis)  The  decadal
survey  raises  concern  about  reductions  in  the  research  and  analysis  ac-
counts  (grants  for  interpreting  data,  developing  new  concepts  for  algo-
rithms,  models,  technology,  and  missions,  and  for  training  graduate  stu-
dents) and emphasizes the need for a strong R&A program to support the
ongoing  and  planned  missions.  According  to  a  2006  National  Academies
report, An Assessment of Balance in NASA’s Science Programs, ‘‘The most
serious impacts on the long-term strategy and capacity-building efforts in
Earth  science  will  result  from  the  severe  cuts  in  the  R&A  program.  Al-
though  the  proposed  R&A  cuts  across  NASA  are  approximately  15  per-
cent,  the  cuts  for  FY  2007  appear  to  be  closer  to  20  percent  in  key  ele-
ments of the Earth sciences.’’ In a constrained resource environment, are
there elements of a balanced program, such as R&A, that should be pro-
tected  beyond  others?  If  so,  what  are  they?  What  is  the  appropriate
mechanism  for  assessing  balance  and  making  adjustments  as  needed?
What  threshold  of  R&A  resources  is  required  to  ensure  a  healthy  pro-
gram?  Are  there  measures  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  investments  in
R&A?

What  is  NASA  Doing  to  Better  Utilize  Earth  Science  Research  Data  to  Ad-
dress Societal Needs?

• The  National  Academies  Earth  science  decadal  survey  stresses  the  impor-
tance of ‘‘advances in fundamental understanding of the Earth system and in-
creased  application  of  this  understanding  to  serve  the  nation  and  the  people
of  the  world.’’  NASA’s  Earth  science  applications  program  supports  competi-
tively  selected  proposals  to  apply  NASA  Earth  science  research  results,  tech-
nologies, and data to high priority societal needs. Those priorities include ag-
ricultural  efficiency,  coastal  management,  energy  management,  air  quality,
and  public  health  among  other  application  areas.  The  applications  program
focuses  on  developing  federal  decision  support  tools.  Is  NASA’s  application
program  structured  to  address  the  decadal  survey’s  recommendations  on  ap-
plications  for  societal  benefit?  What,  if  any,  changes  to  NASA’s  applications
program are needed to make NASA’s Earth science information more respon-
sive to societal needs?

Æ NASA  Authorization  Act  and  Earth  Science  Applications.  Section  313  of
the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  directs  NASA  to  ‘‘establish  a  pro-
gram of grants for competitively awarded pilot projects to explore the in-
tegrated  use  of  sources  of  remote  sensing  and  other  geospatial  informa-
tion  to  address  State,  local,  regional,  and  tribal  agency  needs.’’  NASA’s
response to Section 313, so far, has been to note in its grant solicitations
that the applications program supports organizations with connections to
State,  local,  regional,  and  tribal  constituencies.  Does  this  step  represent
any  change  to  grant  solicitations  prior  to  the  Authorization  Act?  Is
NASA’s  response  sufficient  to  address  the  Section  313  directive?  How
many grants does NASA issue that directly address State, local, regional
and  tribal  needs?  To  what  extent  do  national  decision  support  systems
serve as pilot projects to address State, local, regional, and tribal agency
needs?’’

Æ Commercial  Initiatives  in  Using  Earth  Observation  Data.  Google  Earth
and Microsoft Virtual Earth are making Earth observation data available
over  the  Internet  at  no  cost  to  users.  What  impacts  are  these  initiatives
having on the use of NASA—provided Earth observations data for appli-
cations? What is NASA’s relationship to these commercial enterprises?

What  is  the  Fate  of  the  Climate  Instruments  That  Were  Removed  From
NPOESS?

• When  the  NPOESS  program  was  certified  under  Nunn-McCurdy,  a  number
of climate sensors were removed from the system and the coverage and/or ca-
pability  of  some  sensors  was  reduced.  Following  the  Nunn-McCurdy  certifi-
cation,  OSTP  requested  that  NASA  and  NOAA  assess  the  impacts  of  the
demanifested  climate  sensors  on  NASA’s  and  NOAA’s  climate  objectives.
OSTP  also  asked  the  agencies  to  propose  options  for  mitigating  the  impacts.
At  a  recent  meeting  at  the  National  Academies  Panel  on  Options  to  Ensure
the  Climate  Record  from  the  NPOESS  and  GOES–R  Spacecraft,  NASA  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

6

NOAA  described  several  possible  mitigation  strategies  including  returning
some of the lost climate sensors to NPOESS satellites; placing climate sensors
on  other  (non-NPOESS)  planned  Earth  science  platforms;  developing  free-
flyer  platforms  to  fly  the  sensors;  or  partnering  with  other  U.S.  agencies  to
fly  sensors  or  obtain  the  data.  NASA  and  NOAA  have  asked  the  National
Academies  to  provide  further  input  on  options  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the
lost  sensors.  NASA  and  NOAA  are  developing  a  set  of  near-term  actions  and
cost  estimates  to  inform  OMB  and  OSTP  for  the  FY  2009  budget  process.
What are the implications of potential data gaps on U.S. climate research and
monitoring?  What  contribution  can  the  missions  recommended  in  the  Earth
science  decadal  survey  make  to  minimizing  potential  data  gaps?  To  what  ex-
tent  will  the  reduced  capability/coverage  of  the  sensors  being  retained  in  the
NPOESS program compromise the measurements needed for climate research
and  monitoring?  How  well  do  the  possible  mitigation  strategies  address  the
required accuracy for climate research measurements? When will funding de-
cisions  be  needed  to  accommodate  development  of  satellites  and  sensors  on  a
schedule that avoids potential data gaps?

What Is NASA’s Plan for Transitioning Research Data and Instruments into
Operational Services?

• NASA  research  satellites  often  provide  vital  data  for  ongoing,  operational
services such as weather prediction and disaster warnings. For example, data
from  the  NASA  QuikSCAT  satellite,  which  measures  ocean  wind  speed  and
direction,  is  being  used  at  NOAA’s  National  Hurricane  Center  to  help  deter-
mine a hurricane’s path. In a May 8, 2007 letter to NASA Administrator Mi-
chael Griffin and NOAA Under Secretary Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher,
Jr., Representative Nick Lampson voiced concerns about the lack of planning
for  a  successor  to  QuikSCAT,  which  has  started  its  ninth  year  of  operation
and is six years beyond its designed lifetime. Without QuikSCAT data, hurri-
cane predictions and evacuation plans would be less accurate. The QuikSCAT
example points to the larger challenge, as noted by Rep. Lampson, for NASA
and  NOAA  to  ‘‘systematically  evaluate  the  technology  and  capabilities  from
NASA’s  Earth-observing  missions  for  application  to  NOAA’s  operational  re-
sponsibilities.’’  What  are  NASA’s  and  NOAA’s  plans  for  a  follow-on  to
QuikSCAT and what is the status of those plans?

Æ Congressional  Legislation  Section  306  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of
2005  directed  NASA  and  NOAA  to  establish  a  joint  working  group  and
report  on  coordination  between  the  agencies  on  Earth  science  missions
and their potential for transition into operational service. In addition, the
Earth  science  decadal  survey  states  that  ‘‘The  committee  is  particularly
concerned  with  the  lack  of  clear  agency  responsibility  for  sustained  re-
search  programs  and  the  transitioning  of  proof-of-concept  measurements
into  sustained  measurement  systems.’’  To  date,  NASA  and  NOAA  have
not  established  a  plan  for  transitioning  research  into  operations,  and
Congress  continues  to  await  NASA  and  NOAA’s  response  to  the  Author-
ization  Act’s  directive.  What 
for
transitioning  from  research  to  operations?  As  NASA  considers  moving
forward  with  missions  recommended  in  the  decadal  survey,  how  and
when will decisions on research to operations be made?

is  NASA’s  and  NOAA’s  plan 

What  role  should  international  partners  play  in  NASA’s  future  Earth
science system?

• NASA  has  a  long  history  of  using  international  and  bilateral  cooperation  on
Earth  science  missions.  NASA’s  Upper  Atmosphere  Research  Satellite
launched  in  1991  included  instruments  from  the  United  Kingdom  and  from
a  French-Canadian  team.  U.S.-French  collaboration  on  the  Topex/Poseidon
and follow-on Jason satellites to measure sea surface height and the U.S.-Jap-
anese  collaboration  on  the  Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission  (TRMM)  and
the  Global  Precipitation  Mission  (GPM)  that  is  currently  in  development  are
examples  of  bilateral  cooperation.  The  decadal  survey  discusses  international
cooperation as a means for realizing the missions recommended in the report.
In  a  hearing  of  the  House  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics  held  on
May  2,  Dr.  Alan  Stern,  Associate  Administrator  for  NASA’s  Science  Mission
Directorate,  testified  that  he  plans  to  ‘‘make  strong  progress  advancing  all
four decadal surveys. . .by increasing our international collaboration efforts.’’
Dr. Stern also testified that NASA is considering international arrangements
in which the agency ‘‘would collaborate at higher, more strategic level.’’ What,

in  specific  terms,  do  Dr.  Stern’s  proposals  mean  for  future  NASA  Earth
science  missions?  What  steps  has  NASA  taken  to  explore  potential  inter-
national arrangements on future Earth science missions? What are the oppor-
tunities and risks for working with international partners to advance the mis-
sions  recommended  in  the  decadal  survey?  Are  there  mission  areas,  tech-
nology  areas,  or  measurements  and  observations  that  the  U.S.  should  carry
out on a unilateral basis to maintain leadership?

What are NASA’s Near and Long-term Plans for Sustaining Land Cover Ob-
servations?

• NASA’s  Landsat  system  has  collected  land  cover  data  for  over  thirty  years.
These  data  are  used  by  U.S.  Government,  scientific,  State  and  local  govern-
ments,  non-profit  organizations,  and  international  entities  to  study  land  use
and  change.  The  currently  operating  Landsat  7  satellite  has  lost  25  percent
of  its  imaging  capability,  according  to  NASA  officials.  Landsat  7  is  expected
to  cease  useful  operation  by  2010  at  which  point  NASA  anticipates  a  6–12
month  gap  in  the  collection  of  Landsat  data  until  the  follow-on  satellite,  the
Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  (LDCM),  enters  service  in  2011.  NASA  is
involved  in  a  Data  Gap  Study  Team  to  assess  ‘‘alternatives  to  at  least  par-
tially  offset  the  data  gap.’’  NASA  is  investigating  whether  data  from  inter-
national satellites, including an Indian satellite and a Chinese/Brazilian land
observing system could help address the data gap.

Æ Instability in the Landsat Program Since 1999, NASA has shifted its pro-
curement  approach  for  LCDM  three  times.  Approaches  have  included  a
public-private  partnership,  placement  on  the  NPOESS  platform,  and  fi-
nally  the  current  plan  for  a  free-flying  mission  to  be  developed  and
launched by NASA and operated by USGS. These procurement struggles
echo  a  longer  history  of  difficulties  in  maintaining  the  program.  What  is
the current status of LDCM? Will LDCM provide data that is comparable
to or better than Landsat 7? How likely is a data gap prior to the LDCM
availability? What lessons from the Landsat experience can be applied to
plans  for  future  long-term  observation  systems,  such  as  those  being  con-
sidered for climate monitoring?

Æ LDCM and Thermal Imaging Capability LDCM includes one instrument,
the Operational Land Imager (OLI). According to NASA officials, this in-
strument  will  not  image  in  thermal  bands,  a  capability  that  has  been
provided  on  the  last  three  Landsat  spacecraft.  The  data  collected  in  the
thermal bands provide information to assist in the management of water
resources, in particular agricultural water uses. Adding thermal imaging
capability to LDCM will increase the mission cost and delay the schedule.
Is  NASA  considering  alternatives  to  LDCM  for  providing  thermal  image
data?

Æ LDCM  as  a  Possible  Platform  for  a  Climate  Sensor  NASA  officials  have
also  indicated  that  LDCM  is  being  considered  as  a  potential  platform  on
which  to  fly  a  Total  Solar  Irradiance  Sensor  (TSIS)—one  of  the  climate
sensors demanifested from the NPOESS system. When will a decision on
adding  a  sensor  to  LDCM  be  made?  How  would  adding  the  TSIS  sensor
affect  the  cost  and  schedule  of  the  LDCM  mission,  including  the  length
of the gap in land cover data?

Æ Policy  for  Maintaining  the  Long-Term  Land  Cover  Record  The  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy  (OSTP)  is  preparing  a  long-term  plan  for
acquiring  moderate  resolution,  space-based  land  observation  data  fol-
lowing  the  launch  of  LDCM  in  2011.  The  Landsat  Policy  Act  of  1992
seeks  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  Landsat  data.  What  is  the  status  of
OSTP’s development of a long-term plan for moderate resolution land im-
agery?  What  would  an  operational  program  mean,  in  specific  terms,  for
the  U.S.?  What  role  would  NASA  have  in  an  operational  land  observing
program?  What  responses  do  the  science  and  user  communities  have  to
the goal of an operational Landsat system?

Is  a  National  Strategy  for  Earth  Monitoring  Across  Relevant  Agencies
Needed?

• NASA  has  the  largest  program  in  the  U.S.  Government  for  observing  the
Earth  and  supporting  research  to  understand  the  Earth  system.  Other  agen-
cies such as NOAA and the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Geological Sur-
vey  (USGS)  also  monitor  the  Earth  system  and  fund  Earth  science  research.
How does NASA coordinate with NOAA, USGS, and other federal agencies on

Earth  observations?  Has  coordination  among  NASA,  NOAA,  and  USGS  been
successful,  and  if  not,  why  not?  Should  the  U.S.  consider  a  ‘‘National  Earth-
Information  Initiative,’’  as  proposed  by  former  Presidential  Science  Advisor,
Neal  Lane,  and  others  ‘‘to  reevaluate  the  national  process  of  collecting  and
using civil Earth information, including the effectiveness of governmental or-
ganizations,  the  relationship  between  government  functions  and  private  sec-
tor  activities,  and  the  ability  to  effectively  connect  scientific  developments  to
societal  uses’’?  The  authors  recommend  that  a  blue  ribbon  panel  be  created
to  consider  improvements  to  the  Nation’s  process  of  collecting  and  using
Earth information. What are the pros and cons of such as proposal? What ap-
proach  have  other  nations  and  regions,  such  as  Europe,  Japan,  and  China
taken to exploit Earth information? How important is a potential Earth infor-
mation strategy to U.S. national competitiveness?

BACKGROUND
Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request

The  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2008  budget  request  includes  $1.497  billion  for
NASA’s  Earth  science  and  applications  programs,  an  increase  of  two  percent  over
the  Fiscal  Year  2007  budget  request.  In  the  FY  2008  request,  increases  over  the
President’s FY 2007 budget estimate for FY 2008 were required on several missions
as a result of schedule delays and cost overruns. Those missions include the Global
Precipitation  Measurement  (GPM),  Glory,  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission
(LDCM),  NPOESS  Preparatory  Mission  (NPP),  and  Aquarius  mission.  In  addition,
NASA  canceled  the  Hydros  mission,  which  was  designed  to  measure  soil  moisture,
due  to  the  agency’s  lack  of  funding  to  support  it.  Attachment  4  provides  details  on
the  FY  2008  budget  request  for  NASA’s  Earth  sciences  and  applications  programs.
NASA Earth Science Program Elements

• The Earth Science Research Program provides grant support for research and
analysis  activities  (e.g.,  basic  research,  modeling,  and  technology  develop-
ment); research on interdisciplinary science from the Earth observing system;
suborbital projects (aircraft and uncrewed aircraft); the use of supercomputers
for  the  development  of  Earth  science  models;  and  access  to  supercomputers
for users from other agencies.
• The  Earth  sciences  applications  program  supports  competitively  selected
grants  to  apply  results  from  NASA  Earth  science  research  to  societal  benefit
areas. Specific areas of applications include agricultural efficiency, air quality,
aviation, carbon management, coastal management, disaster management, ec-
ological forecasting, energy management, homeland security, invasive species,
public health, and water management. The applications program involves two
components:

Æ National  Applications  matches  decision  support  systems  in  Federal
agencies  with  information  from  NASA  Earth  science  research  that  can
benefit from the additional NASA information.

Æ Crosscutting  Solutions  supports  the  National  Applications  decision
support  projects  by  providing  systems  integration,  engineering,  and  the
development of prototypes.

• Earth Science Multi-Mission Operations is dedicated to archiving, preserving,
and disseminating Earth science data. The primary data management system
for  Earth  science  data  is  the  Earth  Observing  System  Data  and  Information
System (EOSDIS). EOSDIS handles four terabytes of incoming data from the
Earth  observing  system  (the  Aqua,  Terra,  and  Aura  satellites)  per  day  and
consists of eight Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). The DAACs are
located  at  universities  and  research  facilities  across  the  country  and  dis-
tribute the data to users.
• Earth  Systematic  Missions  include  over  a  dozen  Earth  science  satellites  that
are  collecting  data  about  the  Earth  and  its  atmosphere  and  other  missions
that  are  in  development.  Many  of  the  Earth  Systematic  Missions  enable  re-
searchers to study Earth’s changes in and effort to improve predictions of cli-
mate, weather, and natural hazards. Key missions include:

Æ The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM). GPM is a joint U.S.-Japa-
nese mission to measure precipitation at a frequent rate across the globe
and  enable  correlation  of  precipitation  measurements.  GPM,  which  con-
sists of two spacecraft, is expected to help improve the prediction of flood

hazards and measurements of fresh water resources. GPM spacecraft are
planned for launch in 2013 and 2014.

Æ The  Glory  mission  will  study  the  properties  and  chemical  composition  of
aerosols and clouds. Data collected from the Glory spacecraft will provide
insights  into  the  natural  and  anthropogenic  contributions  to  climate
change. Glory is planned for launch in 2008.

Æ The  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  (LDCM)  is  the  follow-on  mission
to the Landsat 7 satellite. The objective of LDCM is to continue the thir-
ty-year  data  record  of  moderate  resolution,  multi-spectral  land  observa-
tions, which are used by U.S. Government, scientific, State and local gov-
ernments,  and  other  communities  to  study  land  use  and  change.  LDCM
is slated for launch in 2011.

Æ The  NPOESS  Preparatory  Project  (NPP)  will  continue  measurements  of
atmospheric  and  sea  surface  temperatures;  humidity  sounding;  land  and
ocean  biological  productivity;  cloud  and  aerosol  properties  that  are  being
collected  on  NASA  Earth  observing  missions  (Terra,  Aqua,  Aura).  NPP
is also intended to reduce the risk of sensors being planned for the oper-
ational NPOESS system. NPP, which is a joint program with NOAA and
the  DOD,  is  slated  to  launch  in  2009.  Technical  issues  related  to  NPP
are:

• The  Visible/Infrared  Radiometer  Suite  (VIIRS)  instrument  has  en-
countered  technical  problems  that  will  affect  ocean  color  and  aerosol
studies.  According  to  a  recent  Space  News  article  on  VIIRS,  the  con-
tractor  and  NPOESS  program  officials  are  evaluating  possible  solu-
tions to the problem. A science team is analyzing what level of capa-
bility  is  needed  from  VIIRs  to  obtain  science-quality  measurements
and whether such a capability can be met.
• A  flight  model  of  the  Cross-track  Infrared  Sounder  (CrIS)  experi-
enced  a  failure  during  a  vibration  test.  The  instrument  will  undergo
additional tests.
• The Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Limb sensor was re-
moved  from  the  NPOESS  program  during  Nunn-McCurdy.  NASA
and  NOAA  have  decided  to  add  the  OMPS  Limb  sensor  to  NPP  and
to split the costs.

Æ The  Quick  Scatterometer  (QuikSCAT)  is  a  satellite  launched  in  1999  to
measure  wind  speed  and  direction,  factors  that  hurricane  forecasters
have  come  to  rely  on  to  ‘‘measure  the  size  of  a  developing  storm’s  wind
field,  and  in  some  cases  to  locate  its  center  of  circulation,’’  according  to
a  Space  News  article  on  ‘‘Scientists  Exploring  Options  for  QuikScat  Suc-
cessor.’’ QuikSCAT measurements contribute to climate change research,
for instance, through the study of the movements and changes of sea ice
and Arctic and Antarctic ice packs. The data are also used to investigate
changes in rain forest vegetation. Issues with QuikSCAT are:

• The lack of a back-up satellite or planned back-up, should QuikSCAT
• The  implications  of  losing  QuikSCAT  on  the  accuracy  of  hurricane

fail.

monitoring.

• The  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  Program  solicits  proposals  for
scientists to propose small to medium-sized missions that can involve studies
of  the  atmosphere,  oceans,  land  surface,  polar  ice  regions,  and  solid  Earth.
Upon  selection,  scientists  are  granted  the  funds  to  serve  as  principal  investi-
gator  of  the  mission  and  are  responsible  for  the  scientific  and  technical  suc-
cess of the mission. ESSP missions complement larger missions, but are con-
ducted on shorter timescales.

Æ The next solicitation for ESSP proposals is expected in late FY 2008. This
represents a gap of approximately seven years since the last ESSP solici-
tation in 2001.

• The  Education  and  Outreach  program  provides  support  for  fellowships  and
new investigators, as well as K–16 education. The FY 2008 program will focus
on the activities of the International Polar Year.
• The  Earth  Science  Technology  program  includes  development  of  new  instru-
ments  and  measurement  techniques,  information  technologies,  and  tech-
nologies for the Earth science program. NASA’s Langley Research Center and

Global Earth Observation System of Systems

NASA  is  a  member  of  the  group  overseeing  the  U.S.  contribution  to  a  Global
Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS).  GEOSS  is  an  international  effort
to  share  the  Earth  observation  data  collected  from  space,  ground,  and  air  observ-
atories  by  individual  nations.  By  creating  a  common  format  for  the  data  and  pro-
viding a means for integrating and sharing the data, GEOSS will allow for a richer
set of data by which to address national and international societal needs and to sup-
port  scientific  research  of  the  Earth  system.  The  U.S.  and  international  members
that are working toward GEOSS are focusing on key societal issues that can benefit
from  the  shared  and  integrated  data  enabled  by  GEOSS.  Focus  areas  include  im-
proved  observations  for  disaster  reduction,  a  National  Integrated  Drought  Informa-
tion System; and Air Quality Assessment and Forecast. NASA’s Earth science appli-
cations  program  is  involved  in  providing  the  U.S.  contribution  to  the  GEOSS  soci-
etal benefit areas.

Summary  of  February  13,  2007  Hearing  of  the  Committee  on  Science  and
Technology on National Imperatives for Earth and Climate Science
Research and Applications Investments Over the Next Decade

The  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  of  the  House  of  Representatives  held
a hearing on February 13, 2007 to review the results of the National Academies re-
port,  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  National  Imperatives  for  the  Next
Decade and Beyond.

• Dr.  Richard  Anthes,  President,  University  Corporation  for  Atmospheric  Re-
search  and  Co-Chair,  Committee  on  Earth  Science  and  Applications  From
Space,  National  Research  Council,  National  Academies  testified  that  ‘‘at  a
time  when  the  need  has  never  been  greater,  we  are  faced  with  an  Earth  ob-
servation program that will dramatically diminish in capability over the next
five  to  ten  years.’’  The  resulting  impacts  are  likely  to  include  less  accurate
weather  forecasts,  uncertainty  about  the  rate  of  rising  sea  levels  and  uncer-
tainty about the intensity of hurricanes, for example. It is critical to measure
the imbalance between the radiation the Sun is putting out and what is going
out from the Earth and back into space, a factor that is contributing to global
warming.  Dr.  Anthes  noted  that  implementing  the  missions  recommended  in
the  Earth  science  decadal  survey  is  not  just  important  for  reducing  the  risks
of  natural  hazards,  it  is  important  for  managing  our  natural  resources,  in-
cluding water, energy, fisheries, and ecosystems more efficiently.
• Dr. Berrien Moore, III, University Distinguished Professor, Director, Institute
for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space, University of New Hampshire; Co-
Chair,  Committee  on  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space,  National
Research  Council,  The  National  Academies  testified  that  NASA’s  Earth
science  budget  has  decreased  by  33  percent  in  real  terms  since  2000.  Any
budget  increases  that  NOAA  enjoyed  during  the  same  period  were  diverted
to  NPOESS,  which  suffered  from  technical  and  managerial  problems.  The
decadal  survey  ‘‘set  forth  a  strategy  for  a  strong,  balanced  national  program
in Earth science to reverse this trend.’’ He noted that by using small missions
rather  than  large  missions  with  multiple  instruments,  the  decadal  strategy
could  be  implemented  for  a  reasonable  investment,  in  particular,  the  budget
levels  provided  for  Earth  science  in  the  year  2000.  Dr.  Moore  testified  that
the Fiscal Year 2008 budget is not sufficient to enable the implementation of
the decadal survey. While it does provide resources to move forward with high
priority  missions  already  underway,  the  FY  2008  budget,  ‘‘will  leave  NASA’s
Earth  science  with  nearly  50  percent  less  buying  power  in  comparison  to  the
year 2000 and. . .by 2012 will put us at a 20-year low in real terms for Earth
science.’’
• NOAA’s  budget  is  insufficient  to  address  the  growth  in  cost  of  the  NPOESS
and  GOES–R  missions  or  to  restore  the  losses  of  climate  measurements  that
were removed from the NPOESS program. He noted that a small investment,
$70M,  in  early  technology  development  for  the  recommended  missions  would
be  a  good  first  step  in  implementation.  Dr.  Moore  testified  that  finding  the
additional funds to move forward should focus on the benefits of Earth obser-
vations  including  increased  reliability  in  infectious  disease  forecasts,  moni-
toring  of  crustal  movements  and  identifying  active  faults,  and  improved  pre-
cipitation and drought forecasts, among other benefits.

• Honorable James Geringer, Director of Policy and Public Sector Strategy, En-
vironmental  Systems  Research  Institute  (ESRI)  testified  that  drought  can  be
longer-term  and  more  widespread  than  tornadoes,  floods,  hurricanes,  and
earthquakes. He noted that 19 western governors convened to support the use
of satellite data to reduce the impact of droughts on the region, and requested
funds for the National Integrated Drought Information System. He noted that
the  decadal  survey  explored  issues  including  the  benefits  of  Earth  science
data. Mr. Geringer also discussed the frustration that users experience by the
lack of access to and the relevance of remote sensing data to their needs. Mr.
Geringer  recommended,  based  on  the  decadal  survey,  that  the  people  should
have the best possible information to respond to their changing environments,
and to protect their lives, livelihood, and property. He also recommended that
an Integrated Earth Observation System be provided to ensure U.S. competi-
tiveness.  He  referred  to  the  activities  of  the  private  sector,  including  Google
Earth,  Microsoft  Virtual  Earth,  and  other  tools  that  use  remote  sensing  im-
agery  and  the  data  provided  by  commercial  space  remote  sensing  companies.
He  noted  that  users  ‘‘want  objective,  timely,  and  accurate  information.’’  He
discussed  the  need  for  a  system  that  integrates  space,  ground,  airborne,  and
ocean-based sensors as well as a web-based network that integrates the infor-
mation.

Chairman  UDALL.  To  all  who  have  joined  us  here  for  this  very
important  hearing,  I  would  like  to  make  a  short  statement  and  I
will turn to my good friend from Florida, Mr. Feeney, for his state-
ment, and we will begin the hearing.

Today’s  hearing  builds  on  the  Science  and  Technology  Commit-
tee’s  February  13  hearing  at  which  we  examined  the  findings  and
recommendations of the National Academy’s Earth Science and Ap-
plications ‘‘Decadal Survey.’’

The  Decadal  Survey  represented  a  consensus  of  the  Earth
sciences and applications community on what the Earth Science re-
search  priorities  should  be  for  the  coming  decade  and  identified  a
prioritized  set  of  missions.  It  is  an  impressive  report  and  it  pro-
vides  a  very  useful  set  of  benchmarks  for  Congress  as  we  attempt
to evaluate NASA’s current and planned activities in Earth science
and applications.

Today we want to examine how well NASA’s plans and programs
compare  to  the  priorities  of  the  Decadal  Survey  and  the  extent  to
which  NASA  intends  to  support  those  priorities  in  the  fiscal  year
2008  budget  and  beyond.  As  numerous  witnesses  before  this  Com-
mittee  have  testified,  the  situation  facing  NASA’s  Earth  Science
program is not good.

To quote the Decadal Survey, it first noted that the Decadal Sur-
vey’s interim report had cautioned that the Nation’s system of envi-
ronmental  satellites  was  ‘‘at  risk  of  collapse.’’  It  then  went  on  to
state that: ‘‘In the short period since the publication of the interim
report,  budgetary  constraints  and  programmatic  difficulties  at
NASA have greatly exacerbated this concern. At a time of unprece-
dented  need,  the  Nation’s  Earth  observation  satellite  programs,
once the envy of the world, are in disarray.’’

Those  are  troubling  words  because  NASA  has  a  major  role  to
play in the Nation’s and indeed the world’s climate research efforts.
If  NASA  doesn’t  step  up  to  that  role,  the  negative  consequences  of
that failure of leadership will be long-lasting.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  NASA  witness,  Dr.  Freilich,
about  what  NASA  is  going  to  do  to  turn  this  worrisome  situation
around  and  I  hope  that  he  will  be  able  to  provide  some  specifics
on  how  NASA  intends  to  implement  the  Decadal  Survey’s  rec-
ommendations.

In that regard, I am also concerned about the fate of the climate
instruments  from  NPOESS,  and  the  need  to  ensure  that  we  don’t
needlessly  disrupt  the  instrument  development  activities  while  the
Administration is determining what will be done about them.

I hope that the good doctor will be able to shed some light today
on  what  interim  arrangements  are  being  put  in  place  to  preserve
those instrument teams and development efforts.

Finally,  I  think  many  of  us  in  Congress  are  interested  in  ensur-
ing  that  the  Earth  observations  data  being  collected  by  NASA  is
applied wherever appropriate to societal needs. That is why I intro-
duced the Remote Sensing Applications Act, which became Sections
313 and 314 of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005.

It is not clear that NASA’s efforts to date have been fully respon-
sive  to  the  intent  of  that  legislation  and  I  look  forward  to  working
with  the  agency  to  make  sure  that  the  goals  of  the  provisions  can
be realized.

Well,  we  have  a  lot  of  issues  to  address  today,  I  again  want  to

welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to your testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MARK UDALL

Good morning. I’d like to welcome our witnesses to today’s hearing—we appreciate

your participation.

Today’s hearing builds on the Science and Technology Committee’s February 13th
hearing  at  which  we  examined  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  National
Academies’ Earth Science and Applications ‘‘Decadal Survey.’’

The  Decadal  Survey  represented  a  consensus  of  the  Earth  sciences  and  applica-
tions  community  on  what  the  Earth  Science  research  priorities  should  be  for  the
coming decade, and it identified a prioritized set of missions. It is an impressive re-
port,  and  it  provides  a  very  useful  set  of  benchmarks  for  Congress  as  we  attempt
to evaluate NASA’s current and planned activities in Earth science and applications.
Today, we want to examine how well NASA’s plans and programs compare to the
priorities  of  the  Decadal  Survey,  and  the  extent  to  which  NASA  intends  to  support
those priorities in the FY08 budget and beyond. As numerous witnesses before this
committee have testified, the situation facing NASA’s Earth Science program is not
good.

To  quote  the  Decadal  Survey,  it  first  noted  that  the  Decadal  Survey’s  interim  re-
port had cautioned that the Nation’s system of environmental satellites was ‘‘at risk
of collapse.’’ It then went on to state that: ‘‘In the short period since the publication
of the interim report, budgetary constraints and programmatic difficulties at NASA
have  greatly  exacerbated  this  concern.  At  a  time  of  unprecedented  need,  the  Na-
tion’s  Earth  observation  satellite  programs,  once  the  envy  of  the  world,  are  in  dis-
array.’’

Those  are  troubling  words,  because  NASA  has  a  major  role  to  play  in  the  Na-
tion’s—and indeed the world’s—climate research efforts. If NASA doesn’t step up to
that role, the negative consequences of that failure of leadership will be long-lasting.
I look forward to hearing from our NASA witness, Dr. Freilich, about what NASA
is  going  to  do  to  turn  this  worrisome  situation  around.  And  I  hope  that  he  will  be
able to provide some specifics on how NASA intends to implement the Decadal Sur-
vey’s recommendations.

In that regard, I am also concerned about the fate of the climate instruments from
NPOESS,  and  the  need  to  ensure  that  we  don’t  needlessly  disrupt  the  instrument
development  activities  while  the  Administration  is  determining  what  will  be  done
about them.

I  hope  that  Dr.  Freilich  will  be  able  to  shed  some  light  today  on  what  interim
arrangements are being put in place to preserve those instrument teams and devel-
opment efforts.

Finally, I think many of us in Congress are interested in ensuring that the Earth
observations data being collected by NASA is applied, whenever appropriate, to ad-
dress societal needs. That is why I introduced the Remote Sensing Applications Act,
which became Sections 313 and 314 of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005.

It is not clear that NASA’s efforts to date have been fully responsive to the intent
of that legislation, and I look forward to working with the agency to make sure that
the goals of the provisions can be realized.

Well,  we  have  a  lot  of  issues  to  address  today.  I  again  want  to  welcome  our  wit-

nesses, and I look forward to your testimony.

Chairman UDALL. At this time it is my privilege to recognize Mr.

Feeney for whatever statement he may have.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thank you, Chairman Udall.
This  morning’s  hearing  on  NASA’s  Earth  Sciences  and  Applica-
tions programs is the first held by our subcommittee on this impor-
tant topic, and I would like to begin by thanking our witnesses for
taking  time  from  their  busy  schedules  to  join  us  today.  I  realize  a
tremendous  amount  of  time,  effort  and  preparation  goes  into  ap-
pearances  before  Congressional  committees,  and  I  want  all  of  our
witnesses to know that this Committee greatly appreciates your ef-
forts and values your wisdom.

Today’s hearing on NASA’s Earth Sciences and Applications pro-
grams and the fiscal year 2008 budget request gives our Committee

an  opportunity  to  review  NASA’s  management  of  and  rationale  for
its  current  array  of  Earth  observing  missions  and  an  opportunity
to  understand  how  the  agency  will  incorporate  the  recommenda-
tions  of  the  Earth  Sciences  Decadal  Survey  in  its  future  plans.
NASA’S  Earth  Sciences  program  is  one  of  that  agency’s  unsung
achievements.  When  discussing  NASA,  our  nation’s  collective  at-
tention  is  often  focused  on  human  space  flight  or  stunning  images
returned from distant planets and orbiting observatories. But rare-
ly  does  the  national  press  carry  front-page  stories  or  images  from
NASA’s Earth-observing satellites except perhaps during hurricane
season.

Having  said  that,  most  of  the  weather  and  climate-prediction
tools  used  daily  by  forecasters  is  often  a  direct  product  of  NASA-
sponsored  research.  A  good  portion  of  climate  change  research  is
also  made  possible  by  data  taken  from  NASA-developed  sensors,
satellites  and  sophisticated  research  analysis  products.  Will  this
record  of  accomplishment  in  Earth  science  missions  continue?  Yes.
Will  it  happen  fast  enough  to  satisfy  many  of  us  and  the  research
community?  Probably  not.  Are  NASA’s  plans  for  future  Earth
science  research  missions  any  indication  of  the  agency’s  reduced
commitment towards a robust program? Emphatically, no.

NASA’s  other  science  programs,  astrophysics,  planetary  and
heliophysics,  share  the  same  challenges  as  Earth  science.  The  re-
lated  Decadal  Surveys  prioritize  researcher  wishes  and  offer  stra-
tegic guidance on the types and sequence of missions needed to an-
swer leading questions. NASA has neither the resources nor often-
times  the  necessary  technologies  to  fill  all  of  its  desires  but  NASA
does try to fulfill the highest priorities established by the research
community.  Requests  for  expanded  efforts  in  all  NASA’s  fields  of
endeavors simply confirm this agency’s reputation as a place where
the most challenging tasks get done.

Having said that, I hope we don’t drift into an earlier era where
NASA  was  tasked  with  doing  too  much  with  too  little  in  the  way
of  resources.  We  know  where  that  path  led,  so  I  hope  all  NASA
supporters,  myself  included,  temper  our  enthusiastic  desires  with
a  realistic  assessment  of  what  is  possible.  NASA’s  Earth  Science
program  has  produced  stunning  scientific  results  often  dem-
onstrating  for  the  first  time  measurements  and  capabilities  that
have never before been accomplished. I want that record of achieve-
ment to continue. It is also my desire that we build upon this pro-
gram’s  success  to  enable  the  goals  established  in  the  Decadal  Sur-
vey.

Again, thank you, Chairman Udall, and thanks again to the wit-

nesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE TOM FEENEY

Mr. Chairman, this morning’s hearing on NASA’s Earth Science and Applications
Programs is the first held by our subcommittee on this important topic, and I’d like
to begin by thanking our witnesses for taking time from their busy schedules to join
us  today.  I  realize  a  tremendous  amount  of  time,  effort  and  preparation  goes  into
appearances  before  Congressional  committees,  and  I  want  all  of  our  witnesses  to
know that this committee greatly appreciates your efforts, and values your wisdom.
Today’s  hearing  on  NASA’s  Earth  Sciences  and  Applications  programs,  and  the
FY08  budget  request,  gives  our  committee  an  opportunity  to  review  NASA’s  man-
agement  of—and  rationale  for—its  current  array  of  Earth-observing  missions,  and

an opportunity to understand how the agency will incorporate the recommendations
of the Earth Sciences Decadal Survey into its future plans.

NASA’s  Earth  Sciences  program  is  one  of  that  agency’s  unsung  achievements.
When  discussing  NASA,  our  nation’s  collective  attention  is  often  focused  on  human
space  flight,  or  stunning  images  returned  from  distant  planets  and  orbiting  observ-
atories.  But  rarely  does  the  national  press  carry  front-page  stories  or  images  taken
from  NASA’s  Earth-observing  satellites,  except  perhaps,  during  hurricane  season.
Having  said  that,  most  of  the  weather  and  climate  prediction  tools  used  daily  by
forecasters is often a direct product of NASA-sponsored research. And a good portion
of  climate  change  research  is  also  made  possible  by  data  taken  from  NASA-devel-
oped sensors, satellites, and sophisticated research and analysis products.

Will  this  record  of  accomplishment  in  Earth  Science  missions  continue?  Yes.  Will
it happen fast enough to satisfy the research community? Probably not. Are NASA’s
plans  for  future  Earth  Science  research  missions  any  indication  of  the  agency’s  re-
duced commitment toward a robust program? Emphatically no.

NASA’s other science programs—astrophysics, planetary, and heliophysics—share
the  same  challenges  as  Earth  Science.  Their  related  decadal  surveys  prioritize  re-
searcher wishes and offer strategic guidance on the types and sequence of missions
needed  to  answer  leading  questions.  NASA  has  neither  the  resources  nor,  often-
times, the necessary technologies to fulfill all desires. But NASA does strive to fulfill
the highest priorities established by that research community.

Requests  for  expanded  efforts  in  all  of  NASA’s  fields  of  endeavor  simply  confirm
this  agency’s  reputation  as  a  place  where  the  most  challenging  of  tasks  get  done.
Having said that, I hope we don’t drift into an earlier era where NASA was tasked
with  doing  too  much  with  too  little.  We  know  where  that  path  led.  So  I  hope  all
NASA supporters—myself included—temper our enthusiastic desires with a realistic
assessment of what is possible.

NASA’s  Earth  Sciences  program  has  produced  stunning  scientific  results,  often
demonstrating,  for  the  first  time,  measurements  and  capabilities  that  have  never
before  been  accomplished.  I  want  that  record  of  achievement  to  continue,  and  it’s
also  my  desire  that  we  build  upon  the  program’s  success  to  enable  the  goals  estab-
lished in the Decadal Survey.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And my thanks again to our witnesses.
Chairman UDALL. I thank the gentleman from Florida.
At  this  point,  if  there  are  Members  who  wish  to  submit  addi-
tional  opening  statements,  your  statements  will  be  added  to  the
record. Without objection, so ordered.

At  this  time  I  would  like  to  recognize  Ms.  Hooley,  who  is  going
to introduce the first witness, Dr. Freilich. Congresswoman Hooley.
Ms.  HOOLEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  and  I  would  like  to  thank
not  only  you  but  our  Ranking  Member  Feeney  for  allowing  me  to
participate  today  and  the  opportunity  to  introduce  Dr.  Michael
Freilich.  Dr.  Freilich  is  the  Director  of  the  Earth  Science  Division
in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. Prior to
coming  east  to  work  for  NASA,  he  was  a  Professor  and  Associate
Dean  in  the  College  of  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Sciences  at  Or-
egon  State  University,  which  is  in  my  district.  I  am  sure  that  he
is  just  as  proud  as  I  that  the  Oregon  State  University’s  baseball
team just won its second national championship in as many years.
Dr.  Freilich’s  research  focuses  on  the  determination,  validation
and  geophysical  analysis  of  ocean  surface  wind  velocity  measured
by satellite-borne microwave radar and radiometer instruments. He
has developed scatterometer and altimeter wind model functions as
well  as  innovated  validation  techniques  for  accurately  quantifying
the  accuracy  of  space-borne  environmental  measurements.  Thank
you, Dr. Freilich, for agreeing to testify before this committee. I am
sure  the  Committee  will  benefit  from  your  insights,  and  I  would
like  to  state  that  I  have  a  markup  in  another  committee  going  on
at  the  same  time  so  I  will  have  to  leave,  but  we  are  so  glad  you
are here. Thank you for coming.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  gentlelady  for  that  introduction
and I would like to at this time introduce the rest of the panelists.
I  will  start  with  Dr.  Richard  Anthes,  who  is  appearing  before  this
committee  for  the  second  time  after  testifying  on  the  National
Academy’s Earth Science Decadal Survey back in February. We ap-
preciate  his  willingness  to  participate  in  today’s  hearing.  You  all
should  know  he  is  President  of  the  University  Corporation  for  At-
mospheric  Research,  and  I  am  biased.  It  is  also  great  to  have  an-
other Coloradoan here in the Nation’s capital, so Doctor, thank you
for making the trip here.

Next  to  Dr.  Anthes  is  Dr.  Eric  Barron,  who  is  the  Dean  of  the
Jackson  School  of  Geosciences  at  the  University  of  Texas,  Austin,
and  he  was  the  Chair  of  Climate  Variability  and  Change  Panel  of
the Decadal Survey Committee, and this is not his first appearance
before this committee. Dr. Barron, thank you for being here today.
And  finally,  we  have  Dr.  Timothy  Foresman,  who  is  the  Presi-
dent  for  the  International  Center  for  Remote  Sensing  Education
and  has  long  been  involved  in  activities  related  to  promoting  the
application  of  Earth  science  data  that  meets  societal  needs.  Again,
welcome.

I think all of you know, you are pros, you have been here before
but we ask you to limit your spoken testimony to five minutes and
then  after  which  we  will  have  a  interchange  in  which  Members  of
the Subcommittee will have five minutes each to ask questions.

Dr. Freilich, we will start with you. The floor is yours.

STATEMENT OF DR. MICHAEL H. FREILICH, DIRECTOR, EARTH
SCIENCE  DIVISION,  SCIENCE  MISSION  DIRECTORATE,  NA-
TIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA)
Dr.  FREILICH.  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Sub-
committee  Members,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the
President’s  fiscal  year  2008  budget  request  for  NASA’s  Earth
Science  program.  NASA  is  committed  to  Earth  science,  as  am  I.
The  budget  request  includes  nearly  $1.5  billion  for  Earth  science,
an  increase  of  about  $32  million  over  the  fiscal  year  2007  request.
Our balanced program includes flight missions, research investiga-
tions,  applied  science,  technology  investment  and  outreach  pro-
grams.  I  will  focus  my  remaining  oral  comments  on  your  specific
questions.

First,  our  top  Earth  science  objectives  and  plans.  Our  primary
objective  is  to  advance  Earth  systems  science  and  to  use  this  un-
derstanding  sufficiently  to  address  societal  issues.  To  reach  this
goal,  we  will  in  priority  order  first  reinvigorate  the  flight  portfolio
by  building  and  launching  seven  missions  now  under  development
and  initiating  new  missions  as  recommended  by  the  Decadal  Sur-
vey. Second, we are working with NOAA and other agencies to has-
ten  transition  processes  so  that  measurements  pioneered  and
proved  by  NASA  will  be  acquired  by  operational  satellite  systems
over multi-decadal periods. And third, we will preserve and expand
through  competitive  solicitations  the  preeminent  research  and
analysis, applied sciences, technology development and educational
programs  that  distinguish  the  NASA  Earth  science  endeavor.  The
Decadal  Survey  provides  specific  guidance  in  these  areas  and  the

21

President’s  2008  budget  request  advances  us  towards  these  objec-
tives.

You  asked  about  balance  in  the  Earth  Sciences  program.  The
program  is  nicely  balanced  between  flight  and  research  science  ac-
tivities with almost half the total allocated to our 14 operating mis-
sions and the seven missions in development and the other half to
research  applied  sciences,  data  systems,  technology  development
and  education  program.  The  Earth  Science  Subcommittee  of  the
NASA  Advisory  Council  annually  examines  the  split  of  activities
and assesses our scientific performance. Regarding mission size, all
of the missions now in development and those recommended by the
Decadal Survey are focused missions. We are not planning large fu-
ture  observatories  such  as  the  presently  orbiting  Terra  Aqua  and
Aura platforms.

Our  plan  and  timetable  for  implementing  the  Decadal  Survey:
our  selection  of  Earth  observing  missions  to  be  flown  in  the  next
10 to 15 years is guided by the Decadal Survey’s science priorities.
We  take  the  Decadal  Survey’s  recommendations  seriously.  Indeed,
the  2008  budget  request  addresses  the  flight  recommendation  of
the  NRC’s  2005  interim  report  by  including  funding  for  the  key
precursor  missions  highlighted  in  that  report.  Now,  the  final
Decadal  Survey  arrived  too  late  to  influence  the  fiscal  year  2008
budget  but  its  recommendations  are  being  used  in  development  of
the fiscal year 2009 budget request.

Since the survey came out in early 2007, we have been vigorously
pursuing activities in four areas. First, we have undertaken studies
of  each  of  the  recommended  missions  to  understand  in  detail  the
technical challenges and full costs including the science so that we
can  assemble  and  implement  a  realistic  program.  We  are  con-
ducting community workshops to understand the capabilities of the
missions  as  recommended,  to  optimize  the  intended  scientific  re-
turn  and  to  define  the  other  measurements  that  must  be  acquired
in  order  for  the  scientific  goals  to  be  achieved.  The  first  of  these
workshops,  which  is  focused  on  ICESat—II,  is  actually  happening
this  week  as  we  speak  near  BWI.  We  have  engaged  our  inter-
national  partners.  In  the  past  two  months  alone,  I  have  had  eight
productive  multi-day  discussions  with  partner  space  agencies  in
order to identify common interests and complementary expertise so
that  we  can  implement  the  Decadal  Survey  in  a  coordinated  way.
We  are  establishing  joint  working  groups  for  future  mission  col-
laboration  studies  with  the  French,  Japanese,  German,  Canadian
and European space agencies, in all cases building on successful ex-
isting and past collaboration.

NASA  is  also  playing  a  leading  role  in  supporting  the  inter-
national  Committee  on  Earth  Observing  Satellites,  CEOS,  which
coordinates  satellite  systems  for  the  international  Group  on  Earth
Observations, GEO. Finally, as planned, we are revising the Earth
Science  Division  chapter  in  the  SMD  Science  Plan  to  reflect  the
missions and the scientific priorities identified in the Decadal Sur-
vey.  This  revision  will  be  reviewed  by  the  NRC  and  the  Advisory
Council in the early fall timeframe.

Finally,  research  to  operations  transitions  and  applications.
NASA  is  working  closely  with  other  federal  agencies,  in  particular
NOAA  and  USGS,  to  transition  research  capabilities  to  long-term

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

22

operations as the technologies are demonstrated. We have prepared
the first NASA–NOAA report highlighting our fiscal year 2008 joint
activity  plan  as  required  by  the  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act.
NASA and NOAA working with OSTP are conducting joint studies
of  the  impacts  and  mitigation  strategy  in  response  to  the  Nunn-
McCurdy refocusing of the NPOESS program. The Applied Sciences
program  accelerates  the  broader  use  of  NASA  Earth  science  re-
search  results  by  partnering  with  other  organizations  in  pilot
projects  to  demonstrate  how  NASA  results  can  improve  decision-
making  and  resource  management.  In  many  cases,  the  dem-
onstrated  improvements  continue  to  be  used  by  our  partners  even
after  the  NASA  Applied  Sciences  project  ends,  and  we  can  talk
about  specific  examples  of  that.  We  have  identified  an  Applied
Sciences representative for each Earth Science mission in operation
and in development in order to assure rapid and efficient identifica-
tion of applications potential.

So  in  summary,  it  will  require  several  budget  cycles  to  imple-
ment a program derived from the Decadal Survey’s thoughtful and
comprehensive  recommendations.  I  would  like  to  end  by  deeply
thanking the Decadal Survey committee members. NASA’s commit-
ment  to  Earth  science  research  is  commensurate  with  theirs.
Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL H. FREILICH

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to appear today to discuss the President’s FY 2008 budget request for NASA’s Earth
Science  program.  You  have  previously  heard  from  the  new  Associate  Administrator
for the Science Mission Directorate (SMD), Alan Stern, on his general plans for the
entire  Directorate,  in  particular  in  the  area  of  Space  Science,  and  I  welcome  this
opportunity to discuss specifically the important area of Earth Science, especially in
light  of  the  recently  released  National  Research  Council’s  (NRC’s)  Earth  Science
Decadal Survey.

In  your  letter  of  invitation,  you  asked  that  I  address  my  priorities  for  the  Earth
science  program  in  the  coming  years,  as  well  as  the  plan  for  meeting  these  objec-
tives.  My  primary  objective  for  the  Earth  Science  Division  is  to  expand  the  leading
role of NASA measurements and NASA-supported analyses in advancing Earth Sys-
tem  science—improving  our  quantitative  understanding  of  the  Earth  as  an  inte-
grated  system.  To  reach  this  goal,  we  will  reinvigorate  the  flight  portfolio  by  solic-
iting,  implementing,  launching,  and  operating  new  cutting-edge  flight  missions;  we
will  work  with  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  and
other national and international operational agencies to hasten transition processes
so that measurements pioneered and proved by NASA will be subsequently acquired
by operational satellite systems over the multi-decadal periods required to detect cli-
mate  signals;  and  we  will  preserve  and  expand  the  preeminent  research  and  anal-
ysis,  applied  sciences,  technology  development,  and  educational  programs  that  dis-
tinguish  the  NASA  Earth  Science  endeavor.  The  recently  released  NRC’s  Earth
Science  Decadal  Survey  provides  specific  guidance  in  these  areas,  and  the  FY  2008
budget request along with planned interagency and international working group ac-
tivities will allow us to advance toward these objectives.

NASA’s FY 2008 budget request includes $1.5 billion for the study of planet Earth
from  space.  This  represents  an  increase  of  $32.8  million  over  the  FY  2007  budget
request  (adjusted  for  full-cost  simplification  and  the  new  theme  structure  of  the
budget). The FY 2008 request will fund a wide-ranging and balanced program of ac-
tivities, including:

• Developing, launching, and operating Earth-observing space missions;
• Competitively selecting and pursuing research and analysis science investiga-

tions conducted by NASA and non-NASA researchers;

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

• Conducting  Applied  Science  projects  that  help  other  federal  and  regional
agencies  and  organizations  to  efficiently  use  products  from  NASA  Earth  re-
search to advance their missions;

• Soliciting  and  advancing  technology  development  efforts  to  enable  the  mis-

sions of the future; and,

• Providing  education  and  public  outreach  programs  to  make  our  knowledge  of

the Earth accessible to the world.

NASA’s  budget  request  supports  a  balanced  program,  allocating  over  30  percent
of NASA’s request for the Science Mission Directorate and, within the Science Mis-
sion Directorate, allocating 27 percent of funding for Earth Science.

Much  of  the  science  community’s  present  state  of  knowledge  about  global
change—including many of the measurements and a significant fraction of the anal-
yses  which  serve  as  the  foundation  for  the  recent  report  of  the  Intergovernmental
Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)—is  derived  from  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program.
For  example,  using  data  from  Earth  observing  satellites  NASA-supported  research-
ers  are:  monitoring  ice  cover  and  ice  sheet  motions  in  the  Arctic  and  the  Antarctic;
quantifying  the  short-term  and  long-term  changes  to  the  Earth’s  protective  shield
of stratospheric ozone, including the positive impacts of the Montreal protocols; dis-
covering  robust  relationships  between  increasing  upper  ocean  temperature  and  de-
creasing  primary  production  from  the  phytoplankton  that  form  the  base  of  the
oceans’ food chain; and, using a fleet of satellites flying in formation (the ‘‘A-Train’’),
making  unique,  global,  near-simultaneous  measurements  of  aerosols,  clouds,  tem-
perature and relative humidity profiles, and radiative fluxes.

Our improved understanding of Earth System processes leads to improvements in
sophisticated  weather  and  climate  models,  which,  in  turn—when  initialized  using
the satellite data—can be used to predict natural and human-caused changes in the
Earth’s environment over time scales of hours to years.

Importantly,  near-real-time  measurements  from  NASA  research  missions  (includ-
ing  the  Tropical  Rainfall  Mapping  Mission  (TRMM),  the  Quick  Scatterometer
(QuikSCAT),  the  Atmospheric  Infrared  Sounder  instrument  on  the  Aqua  mission,
and  others)  are  used  routinely  by  NOAA  and  other  U.S.  and  international  agencies
to  improve  weather  forecasting.  Similarly,  high  quality  measurements  obtained  by
NOAA’s  operational  weather  satellites  provide  essential  context  for  the  scientific
analyses  of  the  NASA  research  mission  data.  There  is  thus  a  strong  synergy  be-
tween  our  nation’s  research  satellites  and  our  operational  space-borne  systems.
NASA  works  closely  with  the  other  Federal  agencies—specifically  NOAA—respon-
sible for forecasting to transition these research capabilities to long-term operations
as the technologies are demonstrated and matured. As we speak, NASA is operating
14 Earth observing missions. Five more missions are quite far advanced in their de-
velopment,  and  will  be  launched  in  2008  and  2009.  Of  these,  the  National  Polar-
orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project
(NPP)  and  the  Ocean  Surface  Topography  Mission  (OSTM)  will  continue  critical
Earth  System  and  climate  measurements  that  were  initiated  by  the  Earth  Observ-
ing System (for NPP) and the TOPEX/Poseidon and JASON–1 missions (for OSTM).
The Glory mission will fly an instrument to extend our measurements of total solar
irradiance,  as  well  as  an  instrument  that  will  provide  unique,  first-ever  measure-
ments  of  properties  of  atmospheric  aerosols.  The  Orbiting  Carbon  Observatory
(OCO)  and  the  Aquarius  mission  will  make  new,  first-of-a-kind  global  measure-
ments  of  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  concentrations  and  ocean  surface  salinity—
both parameters of known importance to the study of climate change.

The  FY  2008  budget  request  also  funds  the  reconstituted  Landsat  Data  Con-
tinuity Mission (LDCM) for launch in 2011. I am pleased to report that the procure-
ment  activities  for  the  LDCM  are  on  track.  We  recently  announced  the  selection  of
four  contractors  to  study  how  their  spacecraft  could  accommodate  the  LDCM  Oper-
ational  Land  Imager  instrument.  Final  results  are  expected  this  fall.  The  FY  2008
budget funds the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) for launch of its
Core  spacecraft  not  later  than  2013,  followed  a  year  later  by  launch  of  the  NASA
GPM  Constellation  spacecraft.  Extending  the  pioneering  rain  measurements  initi-
ated  with  the  joint  U.S./Japanese  TRMM  and  providing  a  calibration  standard  for
several  other  rain-measuring  instruments  orbited  by  others,  the  GPM  mission  will
provide us with accurate, global rain measurements every three hours—much more
frequently  than  is  currently  possible.  Knowledge  of  accurate  rainfall  rates  and  at-
mospheric water quantities is essential for the study of the Earth’s hydrologic cycle
and  its  sensitivity  to  climate  change.  In  addition,  the  GPM  measurements  will  be
used by operational weather prediction agencies around the globe to improve weath-
er forecasts and severe storm predictions.

As a complement to the research and analysis activities which improve our under-
standing of the Earth system, the Applied Sciences Program evaluates NASA Earth
science data, results, and technology for their potential to serve society beyond their
original  scientific  purpose.  Where  appropriate,  the  program  accelerates  the  broader
use of these Earth science research results by partnering with federal agencies and
other organizations to test whether NASA results can improve decision-making and
resource  management.  In  many  cases,  the  demonstrated  improvements  continue  to
be  used  by  our  partners  in  their  operational  decision  support  systems,  after  the
NASA Applied Sciences project ends.

We have had many recent successes across a broad range of societal benefit areas.
I  will  touch  here  on  examples  in  the  areas  of  air  transportation,  regional  environ-
mental  management,  and  natural  disasters.  NASA  is  working  in  partnership  with
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service,  and  the
National Center for Atmospheric Research to ensure safe and efficient air travel for
the American public through enhancements to aviation weather forecasting. Weath-
er is a contributing factor in approximately 30 percent of all aviation accidents and
accounts for over 60 percent of all delays experienced in the air transportation sys-
tem. Weather delays in air travel cost the American public over $4 billion per year.
By  incorporating  new,  NASA-developed  algorithms,  observations,  and  predictive  ca-
pabilities  into  aviation  weather  forecasts,  more  accurate,  dependable,  and  useful
forecasts  of  threats  to  aviation  including  icing,  turbulence,  convection,  and  volcanic
ash can be made. For example, NASA recently released results that suggest the in-
corporation  of  improved  satellite  observations  and  new  algorithms  into  a  decision
support  tool  for  thunderstorm  initiation  often  enhance  performance  by  providing  a
detailed  analysis  of  the  locations  and  early  growth  of  non-precipitating  convective
clouds.  One  newly  developed  parameter  showed  an  84  percent  probability  of  detec-
tion of convective initiation over a thirty minute window.

In  terms  of  improving  regional  environmental  management  with  techniques
deployable  both  in  the  United  States  and  abroad,  NASA  is  partnering  with  U.S.
Agency  for  International  Development  and  other  U.S.  and  Latin  American  govern-
ment  agencies  and  nongovernmental  organizations  to  develop,  operate,  and  refine
an  environmental  monitoring  and  visualization  system  for  the  entire  isthmus  of
Central  America.  Known  as  SERVIR,  this  system  is  web-based  and  provides
satellite-  and  ground-based  geospatial  data  for  management  and  decision  support.
In  addition  to  a  data  archive,  Internet  mapping  tools,  and  visualization  software,
SERVIR  offers  a  number  of  decision  support  products  including  those  for  fires,
floods,  harmful  red  tide  events,  developing  climate  scenarios,  and  weather  fore-
casting.  Examples  of  recent  activities  are  the  use  of  SERVIR  imagery  by  fire  fight-
ers in northern Guatemala to battle fires and national park managers in Belize em-
ploying SERVIR fire alerts to detect unauthorized incursions and clearing of tropical
forest  within  the  Chiquibul  National  Park.  The  SERVIR  web  location  is  http://
servir.net/.

Another  recent  NASA  Applied  Science  program  contribution  was  our  real-time
support  to  state  emergency  responders  in  the  Esperanza  fires  last  October  in  Cali-
fornia.  A  data  integration  tool  developed  under  Applied  Science’s  Wildfire  Research
and Applications Partnership or WRAP (NASA, USFS and the National Interagency
Fire  Center),  together  with  a  16-hour  emergency  flight  of  a  NASA  Ames  UAS  (Un-
manned  Aerial  System),  provided  invaluable  real-time  information  about  fire  loca-
tion,  intensity,  and  extent  that  was  used  to  guide  the  California  Governor’s  Office
of  Emergency  Services  and  the  Esperanza  Fire  Incident  Command  Center  as  they
battled  the  fire.  The  WRAP  integration  tool  incorporates  data  and  technology  from
an  array  of  sources,  both  public  and  private,  and  displays  the  data  on  a  Google
Earth  software  base.  In  collaboration  with  the  U.S.  Forest  Service,  the  WRAP
project  continues  to  be  supported  by  the  Earth  Science  Division’s  Research  and
Analysis  and  Technology  Programs  to  further  test  the  integrated  UAS  system  dur-
ing actual wildfire events this coming fire season in California.

In March, 2007, the NASA Administrator submitted to Congress the report on the
Applied Sciences Program’s planning, selection, and review processes in Accordance
with  Section  307  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  Authoriza-
tion Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155) (‘‘the Act’’). In this year’s Research Opportunities in
Space  and  Earth  Sciences  (ROSES)  research  announcement,  we  explicitly  incor-
porated the requirements of Section 313 of the Act, which identifies the need to ad-
dress  State,  local,  regional  and  tribal  agency  needs  and  to  utilize  both  NASA  and
commercial  sector  capabilities.  Specifically,  the  Applied  Sciences  Program  requires
grantees  to  utilize  commercially  available  products  whenever  it  is  appropriate  and
available,  consistent  with  NASA  Earth  science  policy.  The  Applied  Sciences  Pro-
gram, under new leadership, is planning a comprehensive review of the program to
ensure  that  it  is  aligned  with  the  NAS  Decadal  Survey  recommendations  and  is

working with NASA leadership to establish an appropriate advisory structure, in ac-
cordance with Section 314 of the Act.

Even  as  we  are  acquiring  and  analyzing  measurements  today,  we  are  planning
the  satellites,  field  experiments,  scientific  investigations,  and  Earth  System  models
of the future. The recently released Earth Science Decadal Survey provides, for the
first time, a scientifically based, community consensus statement of the top priority
future  Earth  System  Science  problems  to  be  addressed,  and  it  suggests  a  sequence
of notional missions whose measurements could contribute to advancing our under-
standing of the Earth and its environment.

We  welcome  the  Decadal  Survey—indeed,  we  asked  for  it.  NASA,  along  with
NOAA  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  requested  and  funded  the  NRC  to
conduct  this  first  Decadal  Survey  in  Earth  science.  We  formally  made  the  request
in the fall of 2003 and the study began in earnest in 2004. The massive undertaking
was  only  completed  this  January.  We  are  grateful  for  all  of  the  efforts  of  the  Co-
Chairs  and  NRC  staff,  the  members  of  the  decadal  survey  Executive  Committee,
and the literally hundreds of Earth Science researchers who volunteered their time
and  their  ideas.  Their  success  in  creating  a  broad  consensus  is  a  substantial
achievement.

The  science  priorities  identified  by  the  Decadal  Survey  will  be  our  primary  guide
as  we  design  and  select  Earth  observing  missions  to  be  flown  in  the  next  10–15
years.  In  the  space  sciences,  NASA  has  a  long  history  of  guidance  by  NRC  decadal
surveys. Indeed, even in the Earth sciences, where this is the first Decadal Survey,
the  President’s  FY  2008  budget  request  for  NASA  was  guided  by  recommendations
included in the interim report issued by the Decadal Survey committee in 2005. The
FY  2008  budget  request  includes  funding  and  predictable  launch  dates  for  the
LDCM, the Glory aerosol and solar irradiance mission, NPP, and GPM, all of which
figured strongly in the interim report.

Unfortunately,  the  full  Decadal  Survey  arrived  too  late  for  its  specific  rec-
ommendations  to  influence  the  FY  2008  budget  process,  but  its  scientific  priorities
will  be  used  in  development  of  the  FY  2009  and  subsequent  budget  requests.
NASA’s  FY  2008  budget  request  also  includes  funding  for  an  additional,  competed
flight  mission,  which  will  launch  sometime  around  2014.  We  will  be  guided  by  the
Decadal  Survey  as  we  choose  the  scientific  focus  and  instrument  complement  for
this mission, starting with a competitive solicitation in late 2008.

In addition to its science priorities and the notional mission set, the Decadal Sur-
vey  provides  several  recommendations  relevant  to  the  design  and  implementation
of the Earth Science flight program. Survey recommendations in the areas of inter-
national  collaboration  and  technology  investment  deserve  particular  consideration.
We all recognize that a constellation of missions and many simultaneous measure-
ments—such as those obtained by the A-train spacecraft described above—are need-
ed to understand the interactions between Earth system processes. No agency or na-
tion can afford to develop and fly all necessary missions single handedly.

The  Decadal  Survey  emphatically  recommends  international  collaboration,  to
maximize  humankind’s  benefits  from  our  net  investment  in  Earth  science,  and  to
avoid unnecessary duplication. To this end, we have already begun discussions with
our  closest  international  space  agency  partners:  the  Canadian,  European,  French,
Japanese,  and  German  space  agencies.  Throughout  the  spring  and  early  summer,
we  held  eight  substantive  bilateral  meetings  with  international  space  agency  part-
ners  to  identify  and  refine  areas  of  common  interest  and  complementary  expertise.
We  are  also  actively  engaged—indeed  NASA  and  the  United  States  are  leaders—
in  international  coordination  bodies  such  as  the  Committee  on  Earth  Observation
Satellites  (CEOS)  and  the  international  Group  on  Earth  Observations  (GEO).  As
with  our  present  OSTM,  Aquarius,  and  GPM  missions,  we  anticipate  substantial
joint  projects  with  international  partners  as  we  construct  missions  to  address  the
Decadal Survey’s science questions. As a result of this Spring’s activities, we are es-
tablishing several bilateral, focused, technical-level working groups to refine science
investigations,  measurement  techniques,  and  programmatic  collaboration  ap-
proaches for some early- and mid-term Decadal Survey missions where clear partner
interest and expertise exists.

NASA  works  closely  with  other  federal  agencies  to  support  an  integrated  federal
program  of  climate  research.  As  noted  above,  the  Decadal  Survey  was  jointly  re-
quested  by  NASA,  NOAA  and  the  USGS  and  assigns  some  priority  missions  to
NASA,  and  some  to  NOAA  for  execution.  NASA’s  contribution  to  the  U.S.  Climate
Change Science Program (CCSP) is unchanged from the FY 2007 to FY 2008 budget
request,  and  remains  the  largest  single  contribution  to  the  Program.  Consistent
with  the  Space  Act  and  the  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act,  NASA’s  role  within  the
broader federal program is guided by the U.S. National Space Policy, authorized by

the  President  in  August,  2006.  In  particular,  NASA  works  closely  with  NOAA  to
transition mature and proven measurement capabilities to long-term operations.

Science-driven  technology  investment  is  one  of  the  keys  to  the  design  and  imple-
mentation of any future mission set. It is essential to have the technology developed
and  tested  in  a  relevant  environment  prior  to  the  approval  of  any  mission.  This
helps to avoid cost overruns that occur when problems arise with a new technology
late  in  the  mission  development  cycle.  To  foster  advanced  technologies  for  Earth
science,  NASA’s  strategy  is  two  pronged,  as  recommended  by  the  Decadal  Survey,
with both focused technology and core technology elements.

Where  we  know  the  missions  we  want  to  implement  and  what  new  technologies
are  required  on  a  certain  schedule,  we  make  focused  investments  to  assure  tech-
nologies  are  available  when  we  issue  competitive  solicitations  for  mission  formula-
tion  and  development.  This  is  done  through  the  highly  successful  Instrument  Incu-
bator  Program,  funded  under  the  Earth  Science  Technology  Office,  which  matures
instrument technologies for future measurements.

The  second  prong  addresses  the  seed  corn  or  ‘‘core  technologies,’’  for  advanced
Earth observing missions of the future. Where we know that certain classes of tech-
nologies  are  needed  for  the  types  of  measurements  we  would  like  to  make  in  the
future,  or  are  simply  convinced  that  investment  in  certain  sensor  or  detector  tech-
nology areas will yield fruit, we will issue open, competitive solicitations for the best
ideas.  Examples  include  advanced  component  development  (which  allows  scientists
and  technologists  to  take  an  idea  from  the  concept  to  the  bench  top  demonstration
stage), laser risk reduction (which has developed fundamental lidar technologies ap-
plicable  to  multiple  NASA  missions),  and  advanced  information  systems  technology
development  (which  provides  advanced  operations  technologies  which  aid  in  reduc-
ing future mission costs).

The Decadal Survey, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, and NASA’s own
planning in Earth science all assume the presence of an operational system of envi-
ronmental  monitoring  satellites  that  can  make  climate-quality  measurements.  The
Nation  needs  such  a  system.  That  is  why  NASA,  along  with  NOAA  and  the  Air
Force,  is  a  member  of  the  NPOESS  governing  body,  and  why  NASA  entered  into
a  partnership  with  the  NPOESS  Integrated  Program  Office  to  develop  NPP.  NPP
is designed both to continue essential measurements from NASA’s Earth Observing
System  satellites  as  well  as  provide  a  demonstration  of  instruments  to  be  flown  on
NPOESS.

The  Nunn-McCurdy  certified  NPOESS  program,  as  you  are  aware,  focuses
NPOESS  on  its  weather  mission  and  deletes  many  of  the  capabilities  previously
planned for climate science. As the Decadal Survey committee was finalizing its no-
tional  mission  set  and  sequence,  the  full  impact  of  the  removal  of  the  climate  sen-
sors  from  the  NPOESS  program  was  just  coming  to  light.  Since  last  summer,  we
in  NASA  have  been  working  closely  with  NOAA,  OSTP,  and  the  scientific  research
community  to  understand  and  rank  the  impacts  of  these  programmatic  perturba-
tions, and to develop realistic mitigation scenarios for the most important measure-
ments.  This  is  being  done  on  an  accelerated  schedule  to  inform  the  development  of
the  FY  2009  budget  request.  In  addition  to  our  agency-based  technical  evaluations
and  preliminary  mitigation  strategy  designs,  NASA  and  NOAA  commissioned,  sup-
ported,  and  participated  in  an  NRC  workshop  which  was  held  last  week  after  sev-
eral weeks of community planning (including members of the original Decadal Sur-
vey committee). The workshop was chartered to examine the scientific and research-
focused  impacts  of  the  programmatic  changes  to  NPOESS  and  to  consider  various
recovery  scenarios.  We  are  eagerly  awaiting  the  workshop  report,  expected  later  in
the  summer,  again  in  time  to  provide  recommendations  useful  for  helping  to  deter-
mine the FY 2009 budget.

I  am  pleased  to  report  that,  in  an  initial  step,  NASA  and  NOAA  have  agreed  to
share  equally  the  cost  to  restore  the  Ozone  Mapping  and  Profiler  Suite  (OMPS)-
Limb to the NPP satellite set to launch in 2009. The OMPS Limb will measure the
vertical  distribution  of  ozone  and  complements  existing  NPOESS  systems,  in  par-
ticular  the  OMPS-Nadir  instrument,  which  continues  the  long  global  time  series  of
total column ozone. The first-ever combination of total and vertically resolved ozone
measurements  will  provide  scientists  unique  insight  into  the  dynamical  and  chem-
ical processes which regulate atmospheric composition.

Considering  both  the  guidance  from  the  Decadal  Survey  and  the  realities  of  the
recent programmatic changes to NPOESS, NASA is proceeding with a mission plan-
ning activity to determine the focus and content of our specific future Earth observ-
ing  missions.  The  plan  will  integrate  the  scientific  recommendations  and  priority/
sequence  of  the  Decadal  Survey,  the  joint  and  ongoing  NASA–NOAA  and  commu-
nity  examinations  of  the  NPOESS  Nunn-McCurdy  changes,  and  the  contributions
of  our  international  partners.  Through  a  series  of  concept  studies  conducted  at

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

27

NASA  Centers,  we  are  carefully  examining  the  Decadal  Survey’s  notional  missions.
The  studies  are  assessing  the  technological  readiness,  system  engineering  chal-
lenges,  and  expected  costs  (including  support  for  scientific  validation  and  analysis
of  the  mission  data)  of  each  notional  mission.  These  concept  studies  are  accessing
the  full  capability  of  the  NASA  mission  design  and  costing  apparatus,  to  com-
plement  the  estimates  assigned  by  the  NRC.  We  have  organized  and  broadly  an-
nounced four community workshops, one for each of the four early-term missions as-
signed  to  NASA  in  the  NRC’s  Decadal  Survey.  The  two  aims  of  each  workshop  are
to  define  the  full  range  of  scientific  capabilities  of  each  of  the  synthesized  missions
recommended  by  the  Decadal  Survey,  and  to  identify  essential  contextual  measure-
ments that must also be present in order to advance the science priorities identified
in the Decadal Survey. The workshops should provide great community insight into,
and recommendations for, these early missions and will aid the subsequent detailed
mission  design  work.  These  first  four  workshops  will  be  held  during  late  June  and
through  July—indeed,  the  workshop  focused  on  the  notional  ‘‘IceSat-II’’  mission  is
being  held  near  Baltimore  yesterday,  today,  and  tomorrow.  As  our  NASA  planning
evolves,  community  involvement  will  be  assured  through  many  more  workshops,
regular  interactions  with  the  Earth  Science  Subcommittee  of  the  NASA  Advisory
Council,  as  well  as  discipline-  and  science-focus  theme  working  groups  which  regu-
larly  inform  our  plans  and  examine  our  progress  within  the  NASA  Earth  Science
Division.

The  planning  process  also  includes  an  update  later  this  year  to  the  NASA  Earth
Science  Plan.  Indeed,  when  the  Congress  asked  the  Agency  for  a  Science  Plan  in
the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155), you recognized that the Decadal
Survey would not be available in time to influence the Earth Science portion of that
Plan.  Therefore,  NASA  was  asked  to  describe  how  it  might  revise  that  Plan  based
on  the  Earth  Science  Decadal  Survey.  Our  planning  activity  and  the  Science  Plan
will address that question. We have developed and are presently examining a draft
of  the  Science  Plan  changes,  and  expect  to  begin  vetting  a  refined  version  through
the NRC and NASA Advisory Council committees by the September time frame.

While  the  scope  and  specificity  of  the  planning  activity  clearly  must  exceed  that
of  the  Decadal  Survey  and  must  accommodate  issues  of  programmatic  balance  and
national  needs,  it  is  definitively  not  our  intention  to  redo  the  Decadal  Survey  or  to
change the scientific priorities that it identified.

As  with  decadal  surveys  in  other  parts  of  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  port-
folio,  this  Decadal  Survey  is  only  the  starting  point.  However,  Earth  Science  plan-
ning  is  even  more  complex  than  in  other  divisions,  given  the  web  of  partnerships,
the  many  and  diverse  users  of  Earth  science  data,  and  its  societal  impact.  Consid-
ering the long time horizon in the NRC’s report, it will require several budget cycles
to implement the program that we will derive from the Decadal Survey’s near- and
mid-term recommended mission sets. Nevertheless, our planning process starts with
the  consensus  scientific  priorities  articulated  for  us  by  the  NRC.  So  I  will  close  by
reiterating  my  gratitude  to  the  Decadal  Survey  committee  Co-Chairs  and  members
for their excellent work. NASA’s commitment to Earth Science research is commen-
surate with theirs.

I welcome your questions on NASA’s Earth science program.

Dr. Anthes, the floor is yours.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RICHARD  A.  ANTHES,  PRESIDENT,  UNI-
VERSITY CORPORATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH; CO–
CHAIR,  COMMITTEE  ON  EARTH  SCIENCE  AND  APPLICA-
TIONS  FROM  SPACE,  NATIONAL  RESEARCH  COUNCIL,  THE
NATIONAL ACADEMIES
Dr.  ANTHES.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Minority  Member  and
Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify
today.  As  Mr.  Udall  said,  I  am  President  of  UCAR,  the  University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and I have to be careful be-
cause  the  gentleman  to  my  left  is  going  to  be  probably  the  next
Chairman  of  the  UCAR  board  of  trustees,  so  I  have  to  be  nice  to
him and to the State of Texas.

Before  I  get  into  my  prepared  remarks,  I  would  just  like  to  re-
mind us that the news of the last few days about the terrible fires
in  the  Lake  Tahoe  area  following  the  winter  of  only  about  30  per-
cent normal snowfall there, the droughts in the West, the droughts
in  the  Southeast  where  some  places  in  Florida  and  Georgia  are  12
feet  below  normal  in  rainfall,  is  all  consistent  with  the  kind  of
changes  that  we  are  worried  about  as  the  climate  warms  in  the
United  States  and  the  rest  of  the  world.  So  the  observations  that
we  are  talking  about  in  the  Decadal  Survey  as  we  said  are  more
important than ever. This is not the time to be cutting back on ob-
servation of the Earth. It is time to be augmenting them.

The  NRC  report  recommends  a  path  forward  that  establishes
U.S.  leadership  in  Earth  science  and  applications  to  avert  the  po-
tential collapse of the U.S. system of environmental satellites. This
can  be  accomplished  in  a  fiscally  responsible  manner.  The  cost  is
very small in comparison to the societal needs and benefits.

Mr. Chairman, you asked me for my views on the top three prior-
ities for NASA’s Earth Science program during the next five years.
The  highest  priority  is  that  NASA  commit  to  and  begin  to  imple-
ment its recommended decadal missions. Starts on the initial seven
missions  should  begin  in  2008.  The  second  priority  is  that  NASA
increase  its  suborbital  capabilities.  NASA’S  airborne  programs
have  suffered  substantial  diminution  and  should  be  restored.  Both
conventional and unmanned aircraft are needed for instrument de-
velopment,  technology  advancement  and  for  their  direct  contribu-
tion to Earth observations. The third priority is that NASA restore
support of its research and analysis programs and efforts in Earth

system  modeling.  Improved  information  about  potential  future
changes  in  climate,  weather  and  other  environmental  conditions
will come from better observations but also more capable models of
the  Earth  system  and  a  vigorous  research  program  to  use  the  ob-
servations in models and interpret the results.

This committee’s leadership on Earth sciences and the recent ac-
tions in the House appropriations process with respect to the fiscal
year  2008  budget  are  encouraging  and  greatly  appreciated,  but
even  with  the  increase  in  NASA’s  Earth  Science  request  for  2008,
funding  falls  short  of  what  is  needed  to  get  a  full  start  on  the  rec-
ommended program, as you can see by this visual which shows the
actual  NASA  budget  starting  in  1996  going  through  the  actual
budget  in  2006  and  2007  and  then  projected  budget  or  requested
budget  in  2008  and  to  run  out  beyond  that.  You  can  see  that  de-
spite the encouraging upward turn for 2008, the gap between what
is  needed  to  complete  and  execute  our  Decadal  Survey  and  what
it is in the run-out from the 2008 request increases every year. The
other point to make from this graph is that the funds to implement
the  Decadal  Survey  are  only  restoring  the  NASA  Earth  Science
budget  and  real  purchasing  power  to  what  it  was  in  the  last  part
of  the  previous  century  and  the  early  part  of  this  one.  So  we  did
a  very  strong  prioritization  to  get  a  recommended  set  of  missions
that  we  considered  minimal  to  meet  the  needs  and  not  one  that
would bust the budget.

You also asked about international partnerships, and Dr. Freilich
made  some  very  encouraging  remarks  in  that  direction  a  few  min-
utes ago. I would like to mention the collaborations with other na-
tions  not  only  saves  scarce  resources  for  all  partners  but  promote
scientific  collaboration  and  sharing  of  ideas  among  the  many  tal-
ented  people  of  all  nations.  However,  they  can  come  at  a  cost.  The
success  of  a  partnership  depends  on  both  partners  meeting  their
commitments,  and  if  one  partner  runs  into  funding  problems  or
technological difficulties, it can threaten the whole mission.

I would like to close my testimony with a quote from Vice Admi-
ral  Richard  H.  Truly,  former  NASA  Administrator,  Shuttle  astro-
naut  and  the  first  commander  of  the  Naval  Space  Command  in  a
recent report, National Security and the Threat of Climate Change.
Describing  his  experience  in  space  25  years  ago,  Admiral  Truly
said,  ‘‘I  have  imager  burned  in  my  mind  that  will  never  go  away,
images  of  the  Earth  and  its  fragility.  I  was  a  test  pilot.  I  was  an
aviator.  I  was  not  an  environmentalist.  When  you  look  at  the
Earth’s  horizon,  you  see  an  incredibly  beautiful  but  very  thin  line.
That  thin  line  is  our  atmosphere,  and  the  real  fragility  of  our  at-
mosphere  is  that  there  is  so  little  of  it.  The  stresses  that  climate
change will put on our national security will be different from any
we have ever dealt with in the past. For one thing, unlike the chal-
lenges  we  are  used  to  dealing  with,  these  will  come  upon  us  ex-
tremely  slowly,  but  come  they  will  and  they  will  be  grinding  and
inexorable.’’ Admiral Truly said he was not convinced of the impor-
tance  of  climate  change  by  any  person  or  interest  group;  he  was
convinced by the data. We as a nation must continue to provide the
data on Earth for only the data can reveal the truth that will affect
us all.

Thank you very much.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Anthes follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD A. ANTHES

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Minority  Member  Calvert,  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee: thank you for inviting me to testify on this important subject. My name
is Richard Anthes, and I am the President of the University Corporation for Atmos-
pheric Research (UCAR), a consortium of 70 research universities that manages the
National Center for Atmospheric Research, on behalf of the National Science Foun-
dation, and additional scientific education, training and support programs. I am also
the current President of the American Meteorological Society. I appear today in my
capacity as Co-Chair of the National Research Council (NRC)’s Committee on Earth
Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  A  Community  Assessment  and  Strategy  for
the Future.

The  National  Research  Council  is  the  unit  of  the  National  Academies  that  is  re-
sponsible  for  organizing  independent  advisory  studies  for  the  Federal  Government
on  science  and  technology.  In  response  to  requests  from  NASA,  NOAA,  and  the
USGS, the NRC has recently completed a ‘‘decadal survey’’ of Earth science and ap-
plications  from  space.  (‘‘Decadal  surveys’’  are  the  10-year  prioritized  roadmaps  that
the NRC has done for 40 years for the astronomers; this is the first time it is being
done  for  Earth  science  and  applications  from  space.)  Among  the  key  tasks  in  the
charge to the decadal survey committee were to:

• Develop  a  consensus  of  the  top-level  scientific  questions  that  should  provide
the focus for Earth and environmental observations in the period 2005–2020;
and
• Develop a prioritized list of recommended space programs, missions, and sup-

porting activities to address these questions.

The  NRC  survey  committee  has  prepared  an  extensive  report  in  response  to  this
charge. Over 100 leaders in the Earth science community participated on the survey
steering committee or its seven study panels. It is noteworthy that this was the first
Earth  science  decadal  survey,  and  the  committee  and  panel  members  did  an  excel-
lent  job  in  fulfilling  the  charge  and  establishing  a  consensus—a  task  many  pre-
viously considered impossible. A pre-publication version of the report was published
in  January  2007  and  is  available  at  www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html;  the  final
version will be published later this year.

The committee’s vision is encapsulated in the following declaration, first stated in

the committee’s interim report, published in 2005:

Understanding  the  complex,  changing  planet  on  which  we  live,  how  it  supports
life,  and  how  human  activities  affect  its  ability  to  do  so  in  the  future  is  one  of
the  greatest  intellectual  challenges  facing  humanity.  It  is  also  one  of  the  most
important challenges for society as it seeks to achieve prosperity, health, and sus-
tainability.

As  detailed  in  the  committee’s  final  report,  and  as  we  were  forcefully  reminded
by the latest set of reports from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
the  world  faces  significant  and  profound  environmental  challenges:  shortages  of
clean  and  accessible  freshwater,  degradation  of  terrestrial  and  aquatic  ecosystems,
increases  in  soil  erosion,  changes  in  the  chemistry  of  the  atmosphere,  declines  in
fisheries,  and  above  all  the  rapid  pace  of  substantial  changes  in  climate.  These
changes are not isolated; they interact with each other and with natural variability
in  complex  ways  that  cascade  through  the  environment  across  local,  regional,  and
global scales. Addressing these societal challenges requires that we confront key sci-
entific  questions  related  to  ice  sheets  and  sea  level  change,  large-scale  and  per-
sistent  shifts  in  precipitation  and  water  availability,  transcontinental  air  pollution,
shifts  in  ecosystem  structure  and  function,  impacts  of  climate  change  on  human
health,  and  occurrence  of  extreme  events,  such  as  hurricanes,  floods  and  droughts,
heat waves, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.

As  a  result,  one  way  or  the  other,  our  international  neighbors  and  we  will  un-
doubtedly be taking steps in an effort to deal with the climate changes we will con-
front.  And  as  we  do  so,  policy-makers  and  others  will  want  to  know  if  such  steps
are  actually  making  a  difference  in  addressing  climate  change.  Yet  at  a  time  when
the need for that kind of information has never been greater, we are faced with an
Earth  observation  program  that  will  dramatically  diminish  in  capability  over  the
next 10–15 years.

Between  2006  and  the  end  of  the  decade,  the  number  of  operating  missions  will
decrease  dramatically  and  the  number  of  operating  sensors  and  instruments  on
NASA spacecraft, most of which are well past their nominal lifetimes, will decrease

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

by  some  35  percent,  with  a  50  percent  reduction  by  2015  (Fig.  1).  Substantial  loss
of capability is likely over the next several years due to a combination of decreased
budgets and aging satellites already well past their design lifetimes.

In  its  report,  the  committee  sets  forth  a  series  of  near-term  and  longer-term  rec-
ommendations  in  order  to  address  these  troubling  trends.  It  is  important  to  note
that  this  report  does  not  ‘‘shoot  for  the  Moon,’’  and  indeed  the  committee  exercised
considerable  restraint  in  its  recommendations,  which  were  carefully  considered
within  the  context  of  challenging  budget  situations.  Yet,  while  societal  applications
have  grown  ever-more  dependent  upon  our  Earth  observing  fleet,  the  NASA  Earth
science  budget  has  declined  some  30  percent  in  constant-year  dollars  since  2000
(Fig.  2).  This  disparity  between  growing  societal  needs  and  diminished  resources
must be corrected. This leads to the report’s overarching recommendation:

The  U.S.  Government,  working  in  concert  with  the  private  sector,  academe,  the
public,  and  its  international  partners,  should  renew  its  investment  in  Earth  ob-
serving systems and restore its leadership in Earth science and applications.

The report outlines near-term actions meant to stem the tide of capability deterio-
ration  and  continue  critical  data  records,  as  well  as  forward-looking  recommenda-
tions to establish a balanced Earth observation program designed to directly address
the  most  urgent  societal  challenges  facing  our  nation  and  the  world  (see  Fig.  3  for
an  example  of  how  nine  of  our  recommended  missions  support  in  a  synergistic  way
one of the societal benefit areas—extreme event warnings). It is important to recog-
nize  that  these  two  sets  of  recommendations  are  not  an  ‘‘either/or’’  set  of  priorities.
Both near-term actions and longer-term commitments are required to stem the tide
of  capability  deterioration,  continue  critical  climate  data  records,  and  establish  a
balanced  Earth  observation  program  designed  to  directly  address  the  most  urgent
societal  challenges  facing  our  nation  and  the  world.  It  is  important  to  ‘‘right  the
ship’’  for  Earth  science,  and  we  simply  cannot  let  the  current  challenges  we  face
with NPOESS and other troubled programs stop progress on all other fronts. Imple-
mentation  of  the  ‘‘stop-gap’’  recommendations  concerning  NPOESS,  NPP,  and
GOES–R  is  important—and  the  recommendations  for  establishing  a  healthy  pro-
gram  going  forward  are  equally  as  important.  Satisfying  near-term  recommenda-
tions without placing due emphasis on the forward-looking program is to ignore the
largest  fraction  of  work  that  has  gone  into  this  report.  Moreover,  such  a  strategy
would  result  in  a  further  loss  of  U.S.  scientific  and  technical  capacity,  which  could
decrease the competitiveness of the United States internationally for years to come.

Key elements of the recommended program include:

1. Restoration  of  certain  measurement  capabilities  to  the  NPP,  NPOESS,  and

GOES–R spacecraft in order to ensure continuity of critical data sets.

2. Completion of the existing planned program that was used as a baseline as-
sumption for this survey. This includes (but is not limited to) launch of GPM
in or before 2012, securing a replacement to Landsat 7 data before 2012.

3. A  prioritized  set  of  17  missions  to  be  carried  out  by  NOAA  and  NASA  over
the  next  decade  (see  Tables  1  and  2  below).  This  set  of  missions  provides  a
sound  foundation  for  Earth  science  and  its  associated  societal  benefits  well
beyond  2020.  The  committee  believes  strongly  that  these  missions  form  a
minimal,  yet  robust,  observational  component  of  an  Earth  information  sys-
tem that is capable of addressing a broad range of societal needs.

4. A technology development program at NASA with funding comparable to and
in addition to its basic technology program to make sure the necessary tech-
nologies  are  ready  when  needed  to  support  mission  starts  over  the  coming
decade.

5. A new ‘‘Venture’’ class of low-cost research and application missions that can
establish  entirely  new  research  avenues  or  demonstrate  key  application-ori-
ented  measurements,  helping  with  the  development  of  innovative  ideas  and
technologies.  Priority  would  be  given  to  cost-effective,  innovative  missions
rather than ones with excessive scientific and technological requirements.

6. A robust NASA Research and Analysis program, which is necessary to maxi-
mize  scientific  return  on  NASA  investments  in  Earth  science.  Because  the
R&A programs are carried out largely through the Nation’s research univer-
sities, such programs are also of great importance in supporting and training
the next generation of Earth science researchers.

7. Sub-orbital  and  land-based  measurements  and  socio-demographic  studies  in

order to supplement and complement satellite data.

8. A  comprehensive  information  system  to  meet  the  challenge  of  production,
distribution,  and  stewardship  of  observational  data  and  climate  records.  To

ensure  the  recommended  observations  will  benefit  society,  the  mission  pro-
gram  must  be  accompanied  by  efforts  to  translate  raw  observational  data
into  useful  information  through  modeling,  data  assimilation,  and  research
and analysis.

Further, the committee is particularly concerned with the lack of clear agency re-
sponsibility  for  sustained  research  programs  and  the  transitioning  of  proof-of-con-
cept  measurements  into  sustained  measurement  systems.  To  address  societal  and
research needs, both the quality and the continuity of the measurement record must
be  assured  through  the  transition  of  short-term,  exploratory  capabilities,  into  sus-
tained observing systems. The elimination of the requirements for climate research-
related measurements on NPOESS is the most recent example of the failure to sus-
tain critical measurements. Therefore, our committee recommends that the Office of
Science  and  Technology  Policy,  in  collaboration  with  the  relevant  agencies,  and  in
consultation with the scientific community, should develop and implement a plan for
achieving  and  sustaining  global  Earth  observations.  This  plan  should  recognize  the
complexity  of  differing  agency  roles,  responsibilities,  and  capabilities  as  well  as  the
lessons from implementation of the Landsat, EOS, and NPOESS programs.

In  your  invitation,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  asked  me  to  explicitly  address  a  number

of issues and I am pleased to do so:
1. What,  in  your  perspective,  should  be  the  top  three  priorities  for  the
NASA Earth sciences program over the next five years, and what, if any,
are the most significant challenges in meeting those priorities?
This is a somewhat difficult question to answer. Five years from now is well into
the period covered by the Decadal Survey, and the Survey has recommended a bal-
anced set of 15 high priority missions for NASA. This set of 15 missions was derived
from  over  100  proposed  missions,  so  a  great  deal  of  priority  setting  has  already
taken  place  by  the  community.  It  is  therefore  important  to  make  progress  on  all  of
these  missions  during  the  next  five  years,  with  greater  attention  paid  to  the  rec-
ommended  missions  early  in  the  queue  (the  2010  to  2013  timeframe  as  described
in  the  report).  Thus  my  answer  to  this  question  will  focus  on  the  highest  priorities
to begin in FY08 in order to lay the foundation for implementing the full set of rec-
ommendations during the next decade.

• First,  NASA  should  commit  to  and  begin  to  implement  its  recommended
Decadal  Missions.  Although,  the  NASA  budget  for  Earth  Sciences  is  not  now
adequate  to  implement  the  survey  recommendations  (see  next  question),  a
useful  start  can  be  made  with  modest  resources.  The  survey’s  initial  seven
missions (2010–2013) should begin in 2008; the first four (CLARREO, SMAP,
ICESat-II,  and  DESDynI)  should  begin  intensive  Phase  A  activities  and  the
next three (for the time period 2013–2016—HyspIRI, ASCENDS, and SWOT)
should  begin  pre-Phase  A  studies.  Increment  needed  beyond  President’s  Re-
quest in FY08: $90 million.

• Second,  NASA  should  increase  its  sub-orbital  capabilities.  NASA’s  airborne
programs have suffered substantial diminution and should be restored. In ad-
dition,  NASA  should  lead  in  exploiting  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV/tech-
nology). Both conventional and UAV aircraft are needed for instrument devel-
opment, and hence risk reduction and technology advancement, and for their
direct contribution to Earth observations. Increment needed beyond President’s
Request in FY08: $10 million.
• And third, NASA should increase support of its Research and Analysis (R&A)
program  and  in  Earth  System  modeling.  Improved  information  about  poten-
tial  future  changes  in  climate,  weather,  and  other  environmental  conditions
is  essential  for  the  benefit  and  protection  of  society.  This  improvement  will
come  from:  a)  better  observations  (the  recommended  missions  and  enhanced
sub-orbital  capabilities);  b)  more  capable  models  of  the  Earth  System;  and  c)
a  vigorous  research  program  to  use  the  observations  in  models  and  interpret
the  results.  The  R&A  program  has  suffered  significant  cuts  in  recent  years
and  these  should  be  reversed.  R&A  investments  are  among  the  most  cost-ef-
fective as they directly exploit on-going missions, advance knowledge to better
define what is needed in the future, and sustain and develop the requisite sci-
entific  and  engineering  workforce.  Increment  needed  beyond  President’s  Re-
quest in FY08: $20 million.

2. What are your perspectives on how well the FY 2008 budget request and
out  year  projections  for  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  align  with  the
recommendations of the Earth science decadal survey?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  is  inadequate  to
meet  the  recommendations  of  the  decadal  survey.  Figure  2  compares  the  request
and the requirements to carry out the recommendations. Even with an encouraging
increase  in  the  NASA  Earth  Science  request  for  FY08,  it  still  falls  short  of  what
is  needed  to  get  a  full  start  on  the  recommended  program.  Moreover,  the  out  year
projections  show  a  steady  decrease  when  the  requirements  call  for  an  increase  to  a
level  of  about  $2.1  billion  by  2010  with  a  level  budget  (in  real  dollars)  after  that.
This committee’s leadership on Earth sciences and the recent actions in the House
appropriations process with respect to FY08 are encouraging and greatly appreciated.
I  am  hopeful  that  the  Congress  and  the  Administration  will  ultimately  support  the
actions  taken  by  this  Committee  and  the  appropriators  in  the  FY08  appropriations
process and continue to build on that momentum into the future.
3. Could  you  please  describe  your  views  on  how  NASA  might  begin  to  im-
plement the recommendations of the National Academies’ Earth science
decadal survey?
It  is  a  truism  that  to  begin  a  long  journey  you  have  to  take  the  first  step.  NASA
should  first  commit  to  implementing  the  recommendations  in  a  timely  fashion,  and
then  begin  developing  implementation  plans  and  schedules  for  the  recommended
missions  and  supporting  research  and  technology  development.  I  am  encouraged
that  NASA  is  planning  workshops  to  further  analyze  the  decadal  survey  rec-
ommended missions, but to develop the survey ideas further will require substantial
investments.

Implementing  the  survey  results  will  require  modest  increments  in  the  NASA
Earth  Science  budget,  restoring  the  budget  back  to  where  it  was  in  real  dollars  in
the  early  part  of  this  decade.  This  will  require  NASA  to  request  the  necessary  re-
sources  and  for  Congress  to  provide  them.  Alternatively,  Congress  could  take  the
lead and require NASA to implement the survey while providing the resources.

My  recommended  first  specific  steps  for  implementation  are  given  in  my  answer

to the first question.
4. What  are  your  perspectives,  as  an  individual  researcher,  on  inter-
national  collaborations  in  the  Earth  sciences,  and  what  value  would
international  collaborations  offer  in  advancing  the  recommended  mis-
sions in the decadal survey?
As  the  survey  states,  international  partnerships  can  be  very  important  in  imple-
menting complex expensive space missions such as recommended in the survey. Col-
laborations  with  other  nations  not  only  save  scarce  resources  for  all  the  partners,
they  promote  scientific  collaboration  and  sharing  of  ideas  among  talented  people  of
all nations. Most of the smart people in the world do not live in the United States!
International collaborations increase the brain pool to carry out the challenging pro-
posed missions and use the observations in creative, innovative ways for the benefit
of society.

However,  international  collaborations  come  at  a  cost.  Any  time  partners  are  in-
volved,  control  must  be  shared  and  the  success  of  the  mission  depends  critically  on
the performance of all the partners. If one partner runs into difficulties (e.g., finan-
cial  support  is  withdrawn),  the  entire  mission  can  be  threatened.  A  successful  col-
laboration also requires assurance that data will be shared and that U.S. scientists
are  full  partners  on  teams  that  ensure  adequate  pre-launch  instrument  character-
ization and post-launch instrument calibration and validation. Other issues such as
regulations governing the sharing of technologies (e.g., International Traffic in Arms
Regulation—ITAR),  governance  and  even  language  and  cultural  differences  can
make international partnerships more difficult and risky than ‘‘going it alone.’’ Nev-
ertheless,  the  potential  benefits  outweigh  the  downsides  and  NASA,  NOAA  and
their  U.S.  partners  in  academia  and  industry  should  seek  opportunities  for  inter-
national partnerships at every turn.

Mr.  Chairman,  the  observing  system  we  envision  will  help  establish  a  firm  and
sustainable  foundation  for  Earth  science  and  associated  societal  benefits  through
the year 2020 and beyond. It can be achieved through effective management of tech-
nology  advances  and  international  partnerships,  and  broad  use  of  satellite  science
data  by  the  research  and  decision-making  communities.  Our  report  recommends  a
path  forward  that  restores  U.S.  leadership  in  Earth  science  and  applications  and
averts  the  potential  collapse  of  the  system  of  environmental  satellites.  As  docu-
mented in our report, this can be accomplished in a fiscally responsible manner, and
I urge the Committee to see that it is accomplished.

I  close  my  testimony  with  a  quote  from  Vice  Admiral  Richard  H.  Truly,  former
NASA  Administrator,  Shuttle  Astronaut  and  the  first  commander  of  the  Naval

Space  Command  in  a  recent  report,  National  Security  and  the  Threat  of  Climate
Change.  Admiral  Truly  speaks  as  one  of  11  retired  senior  military  officers  who
wrote this report that describes the serious threat of climate change to the Nation’s
security. Describing his experience in space 25 years ago, Admiral Truly said:

I have images burned in my mind that will never go away—images of the Earth
and  its  fragility.  I  was  a  test  pilot.  I  was  an  aviator.  I  was  not  an  environ-
mentalist.  But  I  do  love  the  natural  environment,  and  seeing  the  Earth  from
space was the experience that I return to when I think about what we know now
about climate. . .
When  you  look  at  the  Earth’s  horizon,  you  see  an  incredibly  beautiful,  but  very
thin  line.  That  thin  line  is  our  atmosphere.  And  the  real  fragility  of  our  atmos-
phere is that there’s so little of it. . .
The  stresses  that  climate  change  will  put  on  our  national  security  will  be  dif-
ferent than any we’ve dealt with in the past. For one thing, unlike the challenges
we are used to dealing with, these will come upon us extremely slowly, but come
they will, and they will be grinding and inexorable. . .

Admiral  Truly  said  he  was  not  convinced  of  the  importance  of  climate  change  by
any  person  or  interest  group—he  was  convinced  by  the  data.  We  as  a  nation  must
continue  to  provide  the  data  on  the  Earth,  for  only  the  data  can  reveal  the  truth
that will affect us all.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  I  am  prepared  to  an-

swer any questions that you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR RICHARD A. ANTHES

Richard  Anthes  is  the  President  of  the  University  Corporation  for  Atmospheric
Research  (UCAR).  He  is  a  highly  regarded  atmospheric  scientist,  author,  educator
and  administrator  who  has  contributed  considerable  research  in  the  atmospheric
sciences.  Dr.  Anthes  has  published  over  100  peer-reviewed  articles  and  books  and
participated  on  or  chaired  over  40  different  U.S.  national  committees.  He  has  also
received  numerous  awards  for  his  sustained  contributions  to  the  atmospheric
sciences.  In  October  2003  he  was  awarded  the  Friendship  Award  by  the  Chinese
government,  the  most  prestigious  award  given  to  foreigners,  for  his  contributions
over  the  years  to  atmospheric  science  and  weather  forecasting  in  China.  Most  re-
cently, Dr. Anthes was named the President of the American Meteorological Society
for 2007.

Dr. Anthes has made many research contributions in the areas of tropical cyclones
and  mesoscale  meteorology.  He  developed  the  first  successful  three-dimensional
model of the tropical cyclone and is the father of one of the world’s most widely used
mesoscale  models,  the  Penn  State-NCAR  mesoscale  model,  now  in  its  fifth  genera-
tion (MM5). In recent years he has become interested in the radio occultation tech-
nique for sounding Earth’s atmosphere and was a key player in the highly success-
ful  proof-of-concept  GPS/MET  satellite  experiment  and  the  present  COSMIC  (Con-
stellation  Observing  System  for  Meteorology,  Ionosphere  and  Climate  satellite  mis-
sion.

He places a very high value on education at all levels. His philosophy is that any
significant,  long-term  progress  in  solving  the  array  of  problems  facing  the  world
hinges on the education of young people in all countries. This philosophy is reflected
in multiple education and outreach programs at UCAR. For example, in 1996 he ini-
tiated  the  highly  successful  SOARS  (Significant  Opportunities  in  Atmospheric  Re-
search  and  Science)  program,  which  addresses  the  severe  under-representation  of
minority professionals in the atmospheric sciences. This program received the Presi-

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ERIC  J.  BARRON,  DEAN,  JACKSON
SCHOOL  OF  GEOSCIENCES;  JACKSON  CHAIR  IN  EARTH  SYS-
TEM SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN
Dr.  BARRON.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,

thank you for allowing me to testify today.

I believe we have one key goal and that is to simultaneously pro-
tect  life  and  property,  promote  economic  vitality  and  at  the  same
time  enable  environmental  stewardship.  Achieving  that  balance  is
quite  a  challenge,  and  at  a  minimum,  to  be  successful,  we  have  to
do two things. We have to know what components of the Earth sys-
tem are changing and how they are changing and an ability to sep-
arate out the human activity from the natural forces, and we need
to be able to do a better job of anticipating or predicting the future.
It  is  our  ability  to  anticipate  the  future  that  makes  knowledge
about the Earth so powerful.

Our  scientific  community  is  very  appreciative  of  the  actions
taken  by  Congress  at  the  start  of  the  fiscal  year  2008  appropria-
tions  process  as  you  and  your  colleagues  make  real  efforts  to
strengthen  the  NASA  Earth  Sciences  program.  Unfortunately,  the
2008  budget  request  and  its  out-year  projections  are  just  not  ade-
quate.  Under  that  current  funding  and  projections,  the  United
States will have significant gaps in long-term observations, making
it much more difficult to separate out natural and human contribu-
tions to climate change and making it much more difficult to assess
how the Earth is changing. It is equivalent to knowing that we are
having  an  intense  debate  for  policy-makers  on  the  importance  of
solar  versus  greenhouse  gases  and  so  now  let  us  break  this  record
so that it becomes even more challenging, to answer that question.
Under  current  funding  and  projections,  the  key  areas  of  uncer-
tainty in climate models, this ability to anticipate the future so we
can put knowledge to good use will likely continue to languish.

I would also like to stress the fact that the Decadal Survey seeks
primarily  to  ensure  a  reasonable  and  robust  set  of  observations
within a tractable budget where tractable is defined as only restor-
ing the budget to its 2001 level in terms of real dollars while ensur-
ing  that  the  most  critical  observations  and  certainly  not  all  that
are  needed  are  addressed.  For  climate  studies,  the  list  provided  in
the Decadal Survey is truly a base set. Each element is critical and
the  list  is  not  sufficient  to  address  all  the  major  uncertainties  in
forecasting  the  future.  First,  the  Decadal  Survey  seeks  to  sustain
the  multi-decadal  global  measurements  of  key  climate  variabilities
in  order  to  understand  how  the  Earth  is  changing,  to  understand
the  roles  of  natural  versus  human  portion  and  to  assess  and  im-
prove climate models. The list is really a list of fundamentals. The
input  of  energy  from  the  sun,  the  Earth’s  energy  budget,  the  at-
mosphere  temperature  and  water  vapor,  sea  surface  temperatures,
sea surface height, the distribution of snow and ice, ozone profiles,
aerosols  and  surface  winds  is  truly  a  basic  set  of  variables  to  try
to describe how our climate system is changing.

Second, the Decadal Survey seeks to tackle a key issue, the mass
balance  and  stability  of  the  large  icecaps.  The  Decadal  Survey
places a high priority on determining the ice sheet volume, sea ice
thickness,  ice  sheet  surface  velocities  and  improved  estimates  of
the sensitivity of ice sheets to change. This is an area of great sen-
sitivity in the climate system and a huge question we have in front
of us is how stable are those ice sheets.

Third, the Decadal Survey calls for a focus on the two areas that
are considered to be the most limiting in terms of our ability to im-
prove climate model predictions. The first area is aerosol cloud forc-
ing.  It  is  one  of  the  great  remaining  uncertainties  in  climate  mod-
els.  The  second  area  addresses  key  uncertainties  in  the  ocean  cir-
culation, ocean heat, storage and uptake and ocean climate forcing.
If we fail to implement the Decadal Survey recommendations, we
will have an observing system and a NASA research program that
is  much  less  capable  than  the  one  we  had  at  the  start  of  this  cen-
tury. The impact on our knowledge base could also be profound. It
may  be  a  much  longer-term  impact  than  we  realize.  It  is  inter-
esting  to  note  that  these  climate  issues  are  becoming  increasingly
important to the public, and I believe that the demand for informa-
tion from the public will begin to grow. This is occurring at a time
where  we  have  considerable  weakness  in  the  observation  program
and  the  research  and  analysis  program  and  it  is  occurring  at  the
same  time  in  which  much  of  the  NASA  workforce  is  eligible  to  re-
tire,  and  if  you  don’t  have  those  opportunities,  you  are  not  going
to entrain the next generation workforce and so have the potential
to be doing very long-term damage to the Earth sciences by having
this delay.

Thank you for your time, and I welcome any questions.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Barron follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF ERIC J. BARRON

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Minority  Member  Calvert,  and  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee:  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  this  testimony  on  NASA’s  Earth
Science and Applications Programs: Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request and Issues. My
name  is  Eric  Barron,  and  I  am  Dean  of  the  Jackson  School  of  Geosciences  at  the
University  of  Texas  at  Austin.  I  was  also  the  Chair  of  the  Climate  Variability  and
Change  Panel,  which  was  one  of  the  key  components  of  the  National  Research
Council  (NRC)’s  Committee  on  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  A  Com-
munity Assessment and Strategy for the Future.

Our  most  basic  objective  is  to  simultaneously  protect  life  and  property,  promote
economic  vitality,  and  enable  environmental  stewardship.  Regardless  of  our  views
on climate change, we all recognize that this objective is a balancing act. It is impos-
sible  to  have  billions  of  people  on  a  planet  and  not  have  an  environmental  impact.
Impact is also clearly associated with individual, regional and national levels of con-
sumption.  We  also  know  that  nations  that  have  the  strongest  economies  are  the
ones who are the most capable of adapting to change or mitigating its adverse con-
sequences.  Finding  the  optimum  balance  is  enormously  challenging  and  is  in  itself
a  subject  of  great  debate.  However,  it  becomes  impossible  if  we  lack  sufficient
knowledge  of  how  the  Earth  operates.  We  need  a  commitment  in  two  key  areas  if
we are to achieve this most basic objective. First, we need to know how the compo-
nents  of  the  Earth  are  changing  in  response  to  human  activity  and  natural  forces.
Second, we need to continue to improve our ability to ‘‘anticipate’’ or predict the fu-
ture  on  a  variety  of  time  scales.  If  current  climate  projections  are  correct,  climate
change over the next ten to twenty years will have highly noticeable impacts on so-
ciety  and  the  demand  on  climate  scientists  will  begin  to  broaden  substantially.  Im-
pacts  on  agriculture,  water  resources,  human  health,  and  ecosystems  are  likely  to
drive a public demand for climate knowledge that is both sector (agriculture, health,
water, etc.) and regionally dependent. It will be our ability to anticipate or forecast
all  of  these  elements  in  the  future,  and  then  to  take  appropriate  action  on  these

predictions  with  full  understanding  of  their  uncertainties,  that  can  enable  us  to  si-
multaneously  protect  life  and  property,  promote  economic  vitality,  enable  environ-
mental  stewardship,  and  help  assess  a  broad  range  of  policy  options  for  decision-
makers.

This  view  yields  six  key  tenets  that  should  define  the  observation  systems  of  the

future:

(1) Sustained  multi-decadal,  global  measurements  and  data  management  of
quantities  that  are  key  to  understanding  the  state  of  the  climate  and  the
changes taking place are crucial.

(2) Climate  change  research,  including  the  observational  system,  will  be  in-
creasingly tied directly toward understanding the processes and interactions
needed  to  improve  our  predictive  capabilities  and  resolve  the  probabilities
associated with different outcomes.

(3) Evaluation and assessment of model capability will increasingly be the focus
of  future  measurement  activities.  Demonstrating  model  capability  is  likely
to  be  a  driver  for  developing  and  evolving  observation  systems  and  field
campaigns.

(4) The  link  between  climate  research  and  societal  benefit  will  require  a  much
greater emphasis on higher spatial resolutions in climate predictions, obser-
vations, and assessments.

(5) The  ‘‘family’’  of  climate  observing  and  forecasting  products  will  continue  to
grow,  involving  innovative  research  into  societal  connections  with  energy,
agriculture,  water,  human  health,  and  a  host  of  other  areas,  creating  new
public and private partnerships.

(6) The demand to understand the connection between climate and specific im-
pacts on natural and human systems will require a more comprehensive ap-
proach to environmental observation and modeling in order to integrate the
multiple  stresses  that  influence  human  and  natural  systems  (i.e.,  climate,
land use, and other human stressors such as pollutants).

The  importance  of  climate  information  is  clear.  As  economic  impact  from  climate
change grows there will likely be both a change in research emphasis and a demand
for  much  greater  investment  in  climate  research.  Yet,  the  NASA  investment  in  cli-
mate  research  and  observation  is  in  serious  decline.  We  will  enter  the  next  decade
with an observing system that is substantially less capable than we had at the start
of the 21st century.

The specific questions provided by the Subcommittee help elucidate this issue and

I am pleased to answer them to the best of my ability.
(1) What is NASA’s contribution to the U.S. Climate Science Research Pro-
gram in terms of percentage of overall expenditures and percentage of
sensors  dedicated  to  studying  Earth’s  Climate?  What  fraction  of  the
world’s  effort  on  climate  change  research  does  NASA’s  contribution
represent?

At the start of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, considerable effort was
invested  in  labeling  the  contributions  of  each  federal  agency  to  the  components  of
global change research including climate. Further, this analysis identified contribu-
tions  to  the  observing  and  modeling  components  of  the  investment  in  climate  re-
search.  In  1992,  NASA  contributions  were  approximately  70  percent  of  the  total
USGCRP  budget,  with  more  than  a  third  of  the  total  USGCRP  budget  focused  on
climate and hydrology observations provided by NASA (about $400 million of a total
budget of $1,185 million). A decade later, growth in NASA investments in USGCRP
kept  pace  with  the  growth  in  the  total  budget,  and  also  kept  pace  in  terms  of  the
investment  in  climate  research.  In  the  FY08  request,  NASA’s  investment  is  about
60 percent of the total Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the total CCSP
budget request is about 6.5 percent above the 2002 USGCRP budget (figures not ad-
justed  for  inflation).  The  full  set  of  segmented  disciplinary  topics  within  the
USGCRP  set  of  cross-cuts  is  combined  into  one  CCSP  budget.  More  telling  is  an
analysis  of  the  out-year  budgets  with  their  associated  numbers  of  missions  and  in-
struments. Even with the extension of some current missions beyond their nominal
life times, by 2010 the U.S. will have a 35 percent decrease in the number of oper-
ating sensors and instruments on NASA spacecraft. By 2015, the number will have
decreased  by  more  than  50  percent.  In  real  dollars,  NASA  Earth  Sciences  has  de-
clined by more than a half a billion dollars since the 2002 USGCRP budget.

The  total  international  investment  in  climate  science  is  difficult  to  confirm  with
certainty  by  the  science  community,  but  NASA  has  always  been  the  international
leader  in  Earth  observations.  The  decrease  in  research,  missions,  and  numbers  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

instruments  is  a  real  loss  of  capability.  The  baton  is  not  being  passed  to  inter-
national partners, it is simply being dropped.
(2) What  are  your  perspectives  on  the  FY  2008  budget  request  for  NASA’s
Earth  Science  Program  and  how  well  does  it  position  NASA  to  con-
tribute  to  the  U.S.  priorities  and  plans  for  climate  and  related  re-
search?

The  modest  increase  in  the  FY  2008  budget  request  for  NASA’s  Earth  Science
Program is the first sign that the steady erosion of capability and the lack of a cred-
ible  program  of  observations  beyond  the  end  of  this  decade  is  reversing.  However,
the  FY  2008  budget  and  its  out-year  projections  are  simply  inadequate.  Under  cur-
rent  funding  and  projections,  the  U.S.  will  have  significant  gaps  in  the  long-term
observation  record,  making  it  more  difficult  to  separate  natural  and  human  con-
tributions  to  climate  change  and  making  it  more  difficult  to  assess  how  the  Earth
is changing. Debates on issues such as the relative importance of solar versus green-
house causes of warming will continue rather than be solved definitively. Under cur-
rent  funding  and  projections,  the  key  areas  of  uncertainty  in  climate  models  will
very likely continue to languish. Most certainly, the areas of investigation that cou-
ple climate change to societally-important areas such as water, health, and food se-
curity  will  be  delayed.  Stated  frankly,  our  capabilities  to  address  critical  questions
in  climate  change  in  service  to  society  will  experience  a  dramatic  decline  if  the
NASA out-year projections are realized.
(3) Which  missions  and  observations  recommended  in  the  National  Acad-
emies Earth science decadal survey are most critical for advancing our
understanding  of  climate  change  and  any  mitigation  and  adaptation
strategies?  What  uncertainties  in  our  understanding  of  change  would
the observations from those missions help reduce?

In  my  opinion,  a  decadal  survey  in  the  Earth  sciences  produced  a  decade  ago
would have focused on innovation built upon a robust global observing system. Such
a  survey  would  likely  have  focused  on  new  technologies  and  new  capabilities  that
would have extended our abilities to address difficult variables, improve the quality
of  our  observations,  and  demonstrate  an  increase  in  forecasting  capability.  Cer-
tainly,  we  would  have  debated  how  to  balance  the  notion  of  entraining  new  tech-
nologies while still preserving continuity of the observations. Likely, we would have
debated  the  best  mechanisms  to  bring  the  same  ‘‘discipline  of  forecasting’’  that  has
resulted in dramatic improvements in weather forecasting to a much broader family
of variables of interest to our society. In contrast, the Decadal Survey rarely consid-
ered  the  frontiers  that  we  know  are  in  the  realm  of  the  possible.  This  is  not  a  cri-
tique  of  the  Decadal  Survey.  It  is  a  fact  that  the  NRC  effort  sought  primarily  to
ensure a reasonable and robust set of observations within a tractable budget, where
‘‘tractable’’  is  defined  as  only  restoring  the  budget  to  its  level  in  2001  in  terms  of
real dollars, while ensuring that the most critical needs were addressed.

For  climate  studies,  the  list  provided  in  the  National  Academies  Earth  Science
Decadal Survey is a base set. It is prioritized in time, taking into account the exist-
ing instrumentation and international partners, but each element is critical and the
list is not sufficient to solve all of the major uncertainties in forecasting the future.
It  maintains  the  most  basic  needs  and  adds  only  those  missions  which  are  clearly
the most crucial priorities in a set of many critical observations. The request for cli-
mate research reveals the level of constraint applied within the Decadal Survey.

First,  we  must  have  a  sufficient  set  of  sustained  multi-decadal,  global  measure-
ments of key variables in order to understand how the Earth is changing, to under-
stand the roles of various natural and human forcing factors, and to assess climate
models.  Stripped  to  its  fundamentals,  the  climate  is  first  affected  by  the  long-term
balance  between  incoming  and  outgoing  energy.  Both  the  long-term  records  of  total
solar input and the Earth’s energy budget are in jeopardy. Other variables that de-
fine the state of the atmosphere and ocean and provide a foundation for both weath-
er  forecasting  and  climate  are  equally  critical.  These  include  such  fundamental  ob-
servations as temperature and water vapor soundings, the distribution of snow and
ice,  ozone  profiles,  and  surface  winds.  The  de-scoping  of  NPOESS  involved  each  of
these  key  climate  variables.  Without  the  Decadal  Survey  recommendations  we  do
not address these most basic needs of the climate sciences.

Second, current observations and models raise particular concerns about the mass
balance  and  even  the  stability  of  the  large  ice  caps.  In  terms  of  our  capabilities  to
assess  how  the  Earth  system  is  changing,  the  ice  sheets  represent  one  of  the  most
significant  areas  of  uncertainty  and  one  of  the  most  significant  areas  in  terms  of
potential societal impact. The Decadal Survey places a high priority on determining

45

ice  sheet  volume,  sea  ice  thickness,  ice  sheet  surface  velocities,  and  improved  esti-
mates of the sensitivity of the ice sheets to climate change.

Third,  the  Decadal  Survey  calls  for  a  focus  on  the  two  areas  that  are  considered
to be the most limiting in terms of our ability to improve climate model predictions.
The  first  area  is  aerosol-cloud  forcing.  Aerosol  climate  forcing  is  similar  in  mag-
nitude to carbon dioxide forcing, but the uncertainty is estimated to be substantially
larger.  The  impact  of  aerosols  on  cloud  formation  amplifies  their  importance  to  the
climate  system.  The  Decadal  Survey  also  calls  for  a  focus  on  measuring  ocean  cir-
culation, ocean heat storage and ocean climate forcing. Again, the problems are fun-
damental,  involving  the  measurement  of  sea  level,  the  importance  of  how  rapidly
heat  is  being  mixed  into  the  oceans,  and  improvements  in  our  ability  to  simulate
the ocean circulation.

We  are  more  than  capable  of  providing  the  observations  needed  to  address  the
specific  topics  above.  Importantly,  the  climate  chapter  of  the  Decadal  Survey  also
calls  for  us  to  address  much  more  challenging  problems  by  bringing  innovative  ap-
proaches  to  the  fore  and  challenging  our  ability  to  return  to  the  cutting-edge  of
Earth  observing.  The  accurate  measurement  of  the  surface  fluxes  of  energy,  water
and  momentum  at  the  Earth’s  surface,  and  an  improved  ability  to  examine  atmos-
pheric  convection  (which  governs  the  transport  of  heat,  water  vapor,  trace  gases,
and  aerosols  and  defines  cloud  formation)  would  substantially  advance  our  ability
to predict the future and to understand critical problems such as sea level variations
and  changes  in  the  distribution  and  character  of  precipitation.  Missions  dedicated
to  these  two  important  topics  are  not  a  part  of  the  priority  set  from  the  Decadal
Survey.
(4) What  role,  if  any,  do  NASA’s  Earth  science  research  and  related  pro-
grams  play  in  validating  the  accuracy  of  climate  measurements  col-
lected  from  Earth  observing  satellites  and  in  developing  predictive  ca-
pabilities for climate change and its effects?

The  decline  in  capability  is  not  restricted  to  missions  and  instruments.  The  de-
cline  in  the  observation  budget  is  matched  by  a  significant  decline  in  the  Research
and  Analysis  budget  in  the  Earth  Sciences.  Sub-orbital  and  land-based  studies  in-
crease  our  ability  to  assess  and  validate  climate  measurements.  A  comprehensive
approach to the analysis, distribution and stewardship of observations broadens the
base  of  applications  and  entrains  a  broader  set  of  disciplines  and  a  higher  level  of
expertise  directed  toward  increasing  our  confidence  in  Earth  observations,  expand-
ing their value, and improving predictive capabilities.

The loss of capability has the potential to be long-term and particularly costly be-
cause of its timing. The lack of missions, the reduced level of opportunities, the lack
of  innovation,  and  the  weakness  in  the  Research  and  Analysis  budgets  are  likely
to result in a reduction in student interest, and most clearly in the training of grad-
uate students and post-doctoral researchers. This loss of opportunity, with it poten-
tial impact on attracting the next generation of scientists and engineers who design
sensor  systems  and  analyze  data,  matches  a  time  in  which  a  substantial  fraction
of  the  NASA  Earth  sciences  workforce  is  able  to  retire.  The  FY  2008  and  out-year
budgets  have  the  potential  to  create  significant  weakness  in  the  capability  of  the
workforce at the same time that society is demanding an increased emphasis on un-
derstanding climate and its impacts.
(5) What  are  your  perspectives,  as  an  individual  researcher,  on  inter-
national  collaborations  in  the  Earth  sciences,  and  what  value  would
international  collaborations  offer  in  advancing  the  recommended  mis-
sions in the decadal survey?

In  my  opinion,  the  statements  on  international  collaboration  provided  in  the
Decadal  Survey  are  sound.  International  collaborations  have  a  number  of  benefits
including  a  reduction  in  cost  and  a  potential  reduction  in  the  likelihood  of  gaps  in
key  data  sets.  In  addition,  collaboration  can  increase  the  number  of  science  users
and  bring  a  broader  array  of  technologies  to  bear  on  a  specific  problem.  NASA  has
demonstrated  success  in  developing  such  partnerships,  with  TOPEX/Poseidon  and
RADARSAT–1  as  good  examples.  Moreover,  it  is  now  relatively  common  for  flight
agencies to offer announcements of opportunity to the international science commu-
nity as the agencies attempt to maximize the payoff of each flight project.

However,  joint  ventures  must  still  be  considered  with  care,  particularly  for  cli-
mate  data  sets.  As  noted  in  the  Decadal  Survey  climate  chapter,  instruments  built
by  one  partner  may  not  be  designed  to  the  exact  requirements  of  another  partner.
Although two missions may utilize the same type of instrument—for example an al-
timeter—and  therefore  sound  like  they  are  duplicative,  the  differences  in  design
may allow one to resolve ocean eddies and improve our knowledge of the ocean cir-

culation while the other may not achieve this objective. Technology transfer restric-
tions may also prevent the exchange of important technical details about the instru-
ments. Restrictions on access to data and software vary from country to country, as
do  approaches  to  calibration  and  validation.  Joint  ventures  between  government
flight  agencies  and  commercial  partners  can  result  in  serious  complications  with
data  cost,  availability,  and  distribution.  Missions  can  also  be  terminated  or  signifi-
cantly  altered  by  host  countries,  resulting  in  a  greater  impact  if  the  other  partners
had counted on the international partner to provide a key observation or synergistic
measurement.

International partnerships should only be fostered where synergy between instru-
ment  capabilities  and  the  science  requirements  is  strong,  where  there  is  free  and
easy  access  to  data,  and  where  there  is  transparency  in  the  process  of  analyzing
data such that analysis algorithms are freely available.

The  Decadal  Survey  includes  many  examples  where  priorities  were  altered  based
on knowledge of missions proposed by international partners. A case in point is the
cloud-aerosol  mission  (ACE)  proposed  by  the  Decadal  Survey  which,  despite  its  im-
portance in addressing areas of uncertainty in climate models, was placed in phase
2 (2013–2016) because of cloud and aerosol information that would become available
from international sources (GCOM–C and EarthCARE).
End Note

An  improved  ability  to  predict  climate  change  will  allow  us  to  be  good  stewards
of this planet. But few seem to recognize that our ability to better predict the future
has  benefit  far  beyond  addressing  the  consequences  of  increased  levels  of  green-
house gases. The potential societal benefits are substantial. For example, even mod-
est  improvement  in  seasonal  to  interannual  predictions  have  the  potential  for  sig-
nificant  societal  benefit  in  agriculture,  energy,  water,  and  weather-related  manage-
ment.  The  Decadal  Survey  presents  a  vision  that  recognizes  that  the  demand  for
knowledge of climate change and variability will increase. The risk in failing to pro-
vide this information is high. However, our ability to serve society through increased
observing  capability  and  improved  model  prediction  is  far  greater  than  a  single
issue,  even  though  the  issue  of  climate  change  is  of  enormous  significance.  An  im-
provement  in  our  ability  to  anticipate  the  future  increases  our  capability  to  utilize
this knowledge to both limit adverse outcomes and maximize benefits to society.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you very much, Dr. Barron.
Dr. Foresman.
STATEMENT OF DR. TIMOTHY W. FORESMAN, PRESIDENT,

INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR REMOTE SENSING EDUCATION
Dr. FORESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and

Members of the Subcommittee.

I  would  like  to  focus  this  committee’s  attention  on  applications
to  what  I  feel  is  the  foremost  critical  arena  for  carrying  forth  the
NASA  Earth  Science  Application  program  mission  for  translation
and  engagement  with  the  greater  user  community  in  our  society.
I  am  specifically  referring  to  a  1999  initiative  that  existed  among
17  federal  agencies  called  Digital  Earth,  which  was  led  by  NASA
Earth Sciences. These agencies formed a common objective to apply
Web-based  visualization  technologies  to  enable  data  exchange
among the various government departments.

Inter-operability  of  our  government’s  information  resources  is  a
requisite  step  to  addressing  major  decision  support  challenges  fac-
ing our nation at local and state levels across a litany of compelling
issues  ranging  from  disaster  warning  and  response  to  climate
change research. NASA was leading 17 federal agencies in 1999 to
create virtual three-dimensional Digital Earth geobrowsers, today’s
Google Earth. NASA was also leading the design of the underlying
architecture  to  operate  interconnecting  systems  with  Earth  obser-
vation science data and application. The potential promise of these
technologies to display and share data and information was not lost
upon our federal colleagues. They fully recognized that these aston-
ishing  Digital  Earth  capabilities  would  enable  scientists  and  man-
agers  within  our  government  to  take  full  command  of  their  own
agency’s information and resources and interlink with all other in-
formation available throughout the Federal Government.

Our  industry  and  academic  colleagues  were  quick  to  join  with
this  engaging  and  visually  enabled  captivating  initiative  for  Web-
based  collaboration,  and  indeed,  many  have  continued  to  pursue
this  Digital  Earth  vision  long  after  NASA  began  to  decommission
the interagency working group. This decommissioning was unfortu-
nate,  in  my  opinion.  The  loss  of  NASA’s  leadership,  guidance  and
momentum  for  the  Digital  Earth  initiative  has  proven  to  be  a  tre-
mendous setback for critical areas in the Earth observation science
program.  The  fact  that  geobrowsers  such  as  Google  Earth  and
Microsoft’s  Virtual  Earth  and  many  others  can  be  directly  linked
to  the  Digital  Earth  legacy  is  testimony  to  the  paramount  impor-
tance of these technologies for their capacity to deliver science and
information directly to the user community, and this is only the tip
of  the  iceberg.  Seven  years  later,  NASA  cannot  deliver  a  decisive
decision support system or a citizen alert system with anything re-
sembling the ease of use and sophistication of Google Earth.

While  working  for  the  United  Nations  environment  program,  I
launched  Google  Earth’s  first  contract  in  2001  when  they  were
known  as  Keyhole.  Where  was  NASA  leading  us  in  2001?  What  is
NASA’s  Earth  Science  Application  program  doing  today  to  build
real-world  partnerships  that  can  quickly  create  visualization  solu-
tions  for  complex  problems?  What  is  NASA  doing  to  fully  engage

with  these  geobrowser  technology  teams  to  rapidly  move  forth  on
delivering  Earth  observation  science  and  information  to  citizens
and decision-makers? Market forces and free enterprise should not
be allowed to replace NASA and its mission during our current era
of global change and climate variability.

This is why I am most concerned that NASA’s Earth Science Ap-
plication program seriously rethinks its current trajectory and seri-
ously engages with the creative forces of market and academia and
NGOs  but  most  important,  NASA  should  seriously  accept  and  as-
sume the leadership role that it once held in this most fecund and
catalytic  domain  of  science  and  technology  and  apply  this  for  the
service  of  America  and  the  world’s  citizens.  When  NASA  declined
to lead the Digital Earth initiative, the Chinese were happy to leap
to  the  forefront  during  the  last  seven  years  and  launched  a  series
of international symposia and international journals and the Inter-
national Society for Digital Earth.

An  incredible  range  of  phenomenal  and  societal  shifting  applica-
tions  are  currently  underway  applying  Digital  Earth  including
monitoring  of  Darfur  human  rights  violations  and  conflicts,  citi-
zens’  engagement  with  mountaintop  removal  issues  in  Appalachia,
Yukon  indigenous  tribes  assuming  governance  along  the  Yukon
River  Valley,  grassroots  women’s  groups  creating  peace  maps  for
their  community,  and  disaster  response  in  Indonesia  and  Katrina.
A small team at NASA Ames has developed a world-class and free
open  source  Digital  Earth  geobrowser  called  World  Wind.  The
World Wind team, about the same size as Google Earth’s staff was
back  in  2001,  has  been  struggling  for  funding  and  needs  support.
Private  discussions  ongoing  between  Google  executives  and  Direc-
tor  Griffin  regarding  strategic  goals  and  objectives  of  the  Google-
NASA Enterprise partnership should immediately be reviewed and
considered by your Committee.

Rapid  and  collective  action  will  be  required  to  align  NASA’s
Earth  Science  Application  program  with  the  pace  of  development
and action occurring in today’s technology, science and social land-
scape. Google Earth is just two years old. My team helped form and
influence  that  trajectory  with  success  six  years  ago.  What  can  we
expect of NASA over this next year?

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Members  and  Members  of

the Committee.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Foresman follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY W. FORESMAN

1. How can NASA’s Earth Science Applications Program enable the applied

use of NASA Earth observation data for societal benefit?
NASA  has  a  unique  and  valuable  brand  that  facilitates  connecting  segments  of
society,  nationally  and  internationally,  with  the  benefits  of  Earth  observation.  This
brand  of  credibility  still  retains  a  sense  of  intellectual  awe  that  breaks  through
many barriers that other agencies or firms must overcome to convey similar commu-
nications and engagement. Therefore the first challenge for enablement comes with
the brand.

Societal  use  is  a  broad  term,  well  articulated  in  the  National  Research  Council’s
2007  report,  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  National  Imperatives  for
the  Next  Decade  and  Beyond.  This  witness  is  in  full  accord  with  the  recommenda-
tions  of  the  reference  report  and  its  recommendations,  and  will  therefore  attempt
to  elucidate  for  highlight  specific  items,  elements,  or  recommendations  that  are  not
clearly defined in the report.

Society is facing an onslaught of changes that may responsibly be labeled of ‘‘bib-
lical proportions.’’ These actions are occurring at such a pace and scale, that science
teams  are  challenged  to  locate  their  research  plots  and  areas  intact  from  one  year
to  the  next.  Many  forests  have  disappeared,  for  example,  while  science  teams  were
debating  the  carbon  budget  and  biomass  contained  within  them.  These  societal
onslaughts include:

NASA’s  Earth  Science  Applications  Program  (ESAP)  has  the  potential  to  provide
profound  amounts  of  useful  data  and  information  across  the  litany  of  sectors  that
divide  the  human  community  operations.  Forestry,  fisheries,  farming,  education,
health  care,  disaster  response,  community  development,  and  governance  all  fulfill
separate  and  compartmentalized  domains  of  local  and  regional  operations.  NASA
ESAP  has  developed  a  reasonably  literate  understanding  of  how  information  can
flow  from  sensor  collection  to  decision-making  in  the  field.  However,  they  lack  the
financial  resources,  the  personnel  with  experience  and  expertise,  and  the  requisite
infrastructure to implement the process control and operations. They are limited by
NASA’s mandate for research, which is consistently used to set limits on the success
of  programs  within  NASA  ESAP.  Therefore,  major  shifts  in  the  follow  arenas
are  recommend  to  be  placed  on  the  table  if  NASA  ESAP  plans  to  ‘‘enable
the applied use of NASA Earth observation data of societal benefit.’’

• Define the research continuum for NASA ESAP in harmony with the Depart-
ment  of  Defense  categories  (e.g.,  6.1  to  6.6  defines  six  levels  of  research  and
development, while NASA has no differentiation).
• Create  multi-agency  working  groups  with  concrete  deliverable  for  products,
selectively  rotating  chair  positions  on  an  annual  basis,  and  create  funding
mechanisms  for  shared  contracting  (e.g.,  with  membership  in  the  State  De-
partment’s Humanitarian Information Unit).
• Break all grants and awards 50–50 percent into two sectors: (1) major institu-
tions,  and  (2)  small  business  and  NGOs.  Currently  the  vast  major  of  funds
go  to  Congressional  earmarks  or  distributed  to  larger  organizations  and  uni-
versities with a track record of receiving funds.

NASA’s  participation  in  annual  conferences  for  major  users  of  Earth  observation
data  provides  perhaps  the  most  concentrated  and  effective  opportunities  for  NASA
ESAP  to  enhance  enablement  of  data  for  societal  needs.  Annually,  over  13,000  ac-
tive  users  of  satellite  and  spatial  data,  from  all  walks  of  society,  attend  the  ESRI
(Environmental  Systems  Research  Institute,  Redlands,  CA)  annual  user  conference
in  San  Diego.  The  American  Society  of  Photogrammetry  and  Remotes  Sensing
(ASPRS) annually host over 2,000 active scientists, industry and government work-
ers who apply Earth observations data on a daily basis in their vocations. The Inter-
national  Society  for  Photogrammetry  and  Remote  Sensing  brings  multinational  at-

tion, the consensus driven process for define projections also follows a consistent pattern where-

when realized. Examples of the Club of Rome population projections are one case in point.

tention to NASA’s goals with global congress ever four years along with annual spe-
cial focus meetings. NASA should recognize an implement an improved strategy for
engaging  with  these  communities  as  they  represent  the  cadre  of  activist  promoting
and building upon the use of Earth observation data.
Recommendation: NASA ESAP create a comprehensive and strategic campaign to
participate  more  fully  and  support  the  aforementioned  conferences,  along  with  a
least  a  dozen  more,  for  the  purpose  of  1)  gathering  intelligence  on  applications  and
user  requirements  for  NASA  Earth  observation  data  and  information,  2)  foster  the
creation  of  partnerships  with  increased  members  of  these  communities  as  societal
representatives,  3)  identify  critical  and  effective  educational  opportunities,  and  4)
implement a stronger brand marketing program.
2. What  is  involved  in  translating  NASA’s  Earth  observation  data  into  in-
formation  for  decision-makers  in  Federal  and  State  and  local  govern-
ments, commercial enterprises, and non-governmental institutions?
A  fundamental  understanding  is  needed  as  to  the  issue  of  what  is  referred  to  as
‘‘pin  the  tail’’  on  the  decision-makers.  Decisions  that  affect  society  are  mostly  local
and  made  daily  by  the  citizens  of  the  planet.  These  decisions  range  from  carrying
umbrellas  to  applying  sun  screen,  to  where  to  vacation,  to  what  type  of  automobile
to purchase, and hopefully to what type of proposition or political candidate to vote
for  in  an  election.  This  subject  was  investigated  thoroughly  by  a  team  from  GRID
Arendal,  Norway  under  the  leadership  of  Lars  Kristoferson,  where  a  diffuse  and
complex  reality  was  identified  regarding  the  pathways  environmental  and  spatial
data and information enter the decision-making processes of society, Figure 1. A key
finding was that visualization of science data had the most direct impact on societies
and decision-making. An example was given of using Landsat data for the 200-year
land  use  change  study  for  the  Baltimore-Washington  region.2 This  science  study  (a
collaboration  of  NASA,  U.S.  Census,  USGS,  and  the  University  of  Maryland,  Balti-
more  County)  provided  then  Governor  Parris  Glendening  of  Maryland  with  the  vis-
ualization video that propelled the Smart Growth legislation.

Of the five steps define in Figure 1, NASA ESAP has been mostly attuned to Step
1, producing information. The litany of programs and data clearinghouses that have
been  designed,  built,  and  attempted  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  document.  Fun-

damentally,  NASA  ESAP  has  been  underwhelming  in  its  success  to  getting  these
information repositories and enterprises to push the data and information into Steps
2–5.

A  compelling  element  of  translating  data  and  information  for  decision-makers  is
in  having  a  deep  and  experiential  level  of  understanding  regarding  how  decisions
are  made  in  various  agencies,  at  various  levels,  and  among  industry  and  NGOs.
This  witness  has  a  rare  background  that  includes  managing  the  spatial  data  and
information enterprises or departments at the county level, at the city level, for var-
ious  NGOs,  for  businesses,  for  federal  agencies  (DOD,  EPA,  NASA),  for  various
country ministries, and for the United Nations. This experience has taught the wit-
ness  that  translation  by  federal  employees  is  simply  not  an  easy  task  and  must  be
learned  as  an  art  form,  not  an  engineered  or  scientific  script.  Therefore,  the  most
efficacious  approach  is  to  incorporate  into  the  NASA  ESAP  culture  and  operations
various veteran visiting experts from different walks of society, both nationally and
international, on a frequent and consistent basis. Veteran experts can be partnered
with  NASA  ESAP  staff  to  work  on  translation  issues,  pilots,  and  other  exploratory
techniques.  Such  ‘‘interns’  or  visiting  staff  will  provide  for  a  much  more  cost  effec-
tive approach in opposition to the numerous and costly regional workshops and sem-
inars that have been pressed into service in the past. Fact finding workshops do not
translate nearly as well as having veteran experts resident at NASA, for six months
or  longer,  in  defining  and  testing  improved  translating  schemas.  These  expert  ex-
change  type  experiences  provide  many  additional  residual  benefits  by  broadening
the NASA experience base.

NGO  groups  are  especially  poised  to  advance  the  societal  benefits  from
NASA  ESAP  data  and  information.  A  flush  of  successes  were  recently  high-
lighted at the 5th International Symposium on Digital Earth held in Berkeley, Cali-
fornia  (www.isde5.org)  held  5–9  June  2007.  General  Pete  Worden,  Director  NASA
Ames, was a keynote presenter at this conference, which documented Earth observa-
tion data being used for:

in the Appalachian mountains,

• communities working to ameliorate the negative impacts of mountain removal
• monitoring human rights in Darfur,
• disaster response in Indonesia and New Orleans,
• disease vector monitoring and management,
• glacier monitoring and mapping,
• biodiversity assessments,
• land cover change dynamics in South America,
• forest protection through science visualization and community engagement,
• community peace mapping and conflict mitigation, and
• marine species tracking and monitoring.

The  vast  majority  of  these  examples  were  led  by  NGOs.  Typically,  NGOs,  includ-
ing  those  of  recognized  stature  (e.g.,  Conservation  International,  Green  Belt  Move-
ment, Heinz Center, Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund) do not possess large
technical staffs and rely instead on one or two geographic information system (GIS)
technicians  who  usually  import  Earth  observation  data  from  various  sources  for
their  project  assessments.  By  focusing  on  the  functional  methods  to  facilitate  ready
and  free  access  of  timely  and  time-series  Earth  observation  data  for  locations
around the planet, NASA ESAP could revolutionize its impact on society.

Success  has  been  witnessed  in  a  semi-random  fashion  regarding  the  educational
initiatives of NASA ESAP. Many fine examples exist, including the Remote Sensing
Core  Curriculum  (RSCC)  and  Conferences  on  Remote  Sensing  Education  (CORSE)
that  were  initiated  in  the  early  1990s  with  seed  funding  from  NASA  ESAP.  These
programs  were  successful  in  part  because  they  were  based  on  small  core  groups  of
collaborating  experts  as  opposed  to  large  institutions  with  unwieldy  bureaucracies.
In addition, the education programs worked closely with other successful initiatives
such as the NASA/NOAA Globe program.
3. What  gaps,  if  any,  exist  between  the  goals  of  NASA’s  Earth  Science  Ap-
plications  Program  and  the  tools  and  processes  needed  to  translate
Earth  observation  data  into  useful  applications?  What,  if  any,  improve-
ments to NASA’s Applications Program would you recommend?
NASA ESAP was once the world leader in an initiative called Digital Earth begin-
ning in 1998. This initiative involved 17 federal agencies agreeing to cooperate, with
no  funds  exchanged  and  led  by  NASA,  on  defining  and  creating  the  tools  and  proc-
ess needed to translate Earth observation data into useful applications. The Digital

55

Earth  initiative  was  heralded  around  the  country  and  the  world,  with  the  Chinese
Academy  of  Sciences  embedding  the  program  immediately  into  their  structure  and
out-year planning processes. The Chinese founded the International Society for Dig-
ital  Earth  May  of  2006  and  are  responsible  for  helping  initiate  the  new  Inter-
national  Journal  for  Digital  Earth  (Taylor  and  Francis  Publishers).  This  sequence
of international successes has been accomplished without NASA ESAP participation
since  2001,  due  to  political  decisions  made  under  the  current  administration.  The
reasoning  behind  NASA  ESAP’s  decision  to  kill  the  Digital  Earth  initiative  that
NASA  had  created  and  nurtured,  was  due  to  the  association  of  former  Vice  Presi-
dent Al Gore’s name regarding a speech where he mentions the Digital Earth vision.
Had the current administration followed the same logic with the Internet, Congress
would be using alternative means of communications. This gap in NASA’s judgment
has had profound impacts on its ability to work with and lead in delivering the tools
and processes necessary to translate Earth observation data.

Further  testimony  on  this  subject  is  provided  from  the  witness’s  direct  relation-
ship  with  the  Digital  Earth  community  after  leaving  NASA  Headquarters  in  2000
for the position as Director of Early Warning and Assessment at the United Nations
Environment  Programme  (UNEP).  While  at  UNEP,  the  witness  provided  the  first
contract with the founders of Google Earth (then operating as Keyhole Inc. with four
programmers).  These  types  of  entrepreneurial  opportunities  for  more  effective  tools
and  processes  for  translating  and  delivering  Earth  observation  data  were  therefore
squandered by NASA ESAP and have not been recaptured. Currently, as witnessed
at the 5th International Symposium on Digital Earth, a suite of organizations is re-
fining  and  operating  Digital  Earth  geobrowsers  (e.g.,  NASA’s  World  Wind,
Geofusion’s  GeoMatrix,  ESRI’s  ArcGIS  Explorer,  Microsoft’s  Virtual  Earth,  Google
Earth,  Skyline’s  Globe)  that  can  and  will  be  the  primary  tools  for  delivering  data
and information to decision-makers and citizens throughout the planet. NASA ESAP
is  not  engaged  in  these  works,  albeit  conversations  with  Google  executives  and  Dr.
Griffin  (NASA  Administrator)  have  been  on  going.  The  flaw  in  these  discussions  is
that  NASA  ESAP  is  not  engaged  with  the  community,  but  rather  has  limited  stra-
tegic  dialogues  with  only  one  of  the  industry  leaders  and  therefore  is  not  dem-
onstrating  comprehensive  attention  regarding  the  requirement  to  engage  with  the
community  of  developers  as  a  whole,  including  its  own  NASA  World  Wind.  NASA’s
World  Wind  geobrowser  (an  open  source  software  platform),  while  internationally
recognized  for  its  technical  prowess  and  performance,  receives  short  thrift  in  finan-
cial and staffing support from NASA’s administration.

The  number  one  recommendation  for  NASA  ESAP  is  to  terminate  the
failed policy of linking Mr. Gore with Digital Earth (there is no factual link,
only  an  historic  footnote)  and  revisit  the  potential  leadership  role  for  the
Digital Earth technical and user community both national and internation-
ally. This recommendation will require immediate attention due to the ongoing dia-
logue with Eric Schmidt (Google executive) and Brigadier General Pete Worden and
other  NASA  executives  for  a  specialized  center  to  be  created  with  Google  funds  at
the  NASA  Ames  Research  facility  in  Moffett  Field,  California.  A  NASA  Digital
Earth  facility  with  full  and  open  access  by  NGOs,  academia,  industry,  government
agencies  and  international  groups  should  be  seriously  considered  to  address  this
question (#3).

The second recommendation is for NASA ESAP to join in supporting the
Digital Earth Exchange (DEX) being piloted by the San Diego State Univer-
sity  Visualization  Center.  The  SDSU  Visualization  Center,  under  the  leadership
of  Dr.  Eric  Frost  and  senior  scientist  John  Graham,  has  been  hosting  the  Strong
Angel  Series  to  demonstrate  and  further  develop  the  effectiveness  for  open-source,
and  inter-operability  standards  in  emergencies  and  disaster  response  to  use  multi-
source  satellite  imagery  and  field  data  for  operational  use.  This  facility  has  ad-
vanced  the  understanding  of  real-time  data  exchange  and  decision  support  among
a collection of leading federal, State, industry, NGO, and academic participants (in-
cluding  DOD  and  FEMA  representatives).  This  facility  and  the  coalition  of  super-
computer nodes working in alliance with SDSU, represents the epitome of cost-effec-
tive, cutting edge technologic application of Earth observation data for web-delivery
of  societal  priority  decision  support  needs.  This  entrepreneurial  enterprise  is  filling
in  the  major  gaps  that  exist  in  NASA’s  ESAP  technology  translation  and  applica-
tions.
4. What changes, if any, in NASA’s Earth Science Applications Program are
needed to implement the recommendations of the Earth science decadal
survey on applications and the transition of research into operations?
With  respect  to  the  17  missions  defined  in  the  Earth  Science  decadal  survey,
NASA ESAP is currently below capacity with the expertise for the science missions

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

and for the defining the translation issues and capacity to provide adequate support.
The  current  staff  is  required  to  perform  heroic  efforts  in  hours  and  stress  to  keep
up with the demands while attempting to cope with the decreasing scope and quan-
tity  of  sensors  and  missions.  Land  cover  continuity  has  become  a  Sisyphean  task
with civil servants constantly engaging with community and industry experts to ex-
amine  new  alternatives,  while  the  legacy  of  a  35-year  Earth  observation  jewel  for
science is held hostage to programmatic shifts, budgetary cuts, and inter-agency pol-
itics  (DOD’s  past  role  in  Landsat  is  a  prime  example).  Climate  change  and  land
cover  change  scientists  have  demonstrated  the  unqualified  success  of  hav-
ing a time-series record of our planet’s land surface phenomena. There is no
method  to  recreate  this  legacy  and  soon  it  will  be  demonstrated  for  its
vulnerabilities under the present trajectory.

A  prime  example  of  the  successful  use  of  the  Landsat  time-series  has  been  the
recent UNEP publication One Planet Many People: Atlas of Our Changing Environ-
ment.  This  publication  has  sold  more  copies  than  any  other  environmental  publica-
tion in the history of the UN. It has been translated for access on Google Earth and
is changing the very way people view our dynamic world. A point in fact is the lim-
ited  role  that  NASA  played  in  this  effort  (exceptions  noted  for  Dr.  Martha  Maiden,
Dr.  David  Herring,  Mr.  Woody  Turner,  and  Dr.  Rebecca  Lindsey  who  consulted  on
this project).
Recommendation: Institute major changes in NASA ESAP’s plan of action in 2008
to  take  leadership  in  the  development  of  land  cover  change  products,  atlases,  and
web-based information for every nation on the planet. This must be carefully coordi-
nated  with  leading  land  cover  change  researchers  and  programs,  such  as  those  of
Conservation  International,  Nature  Conservancy,  IGBP,  UNEP,  FAO,  and  Planet
Action.

The litany of science missions define in the decadal survey portrays a serious lack
of instrumentation for column measurements of greenhouse gases. Instruments have
recently be identified, with solid understanding of the physics, by Dr. Robert Corell
(The  H.  John  Heinz  III  Center  for  Science,  Economics  and  the  Environment)  and
colleagues  that  would  attend  to  the  measurements  and  monitoring  of  column  CO2
and other greenhouse gases. These measurements are proving critical as the science
of  natural  and  anthropogenic  gas  emissions  and  fluxes  advances.  NASA’s  cutbacks
in  sensor  development  and  missions  has  curtailed,  if  not  sequestered,  the  introduc-
tion  of  new  and  economically  feasible  greenhouse  gases  monitoring  missions  and
programs.
Recommendation:  NASA  ESAP  conduct  a  rapid  review  workshop  with  leading
geophysicists,  atmospheric  scientists,  and  instrumentation  engineers  to  ascertain
the  feasibility  and  scoping  of  new  instruments  and  missions  for  climate  change  re-
search beyond those discussed in the decadal survey.
5. Based  on  your  experience  as  a  ‘‘user,’’  and  your  experience  in  working
with  users,  what  are  the  most  important  steps  NASA  should  take  to  ex-
pand  the  application  of  NASA’s  Earth  observation  data  to  meet  social
needs?
NASA will require a reinvention, or reestablishment of its mission, to in-
clude  Earth  as  it  primary  planet  of  study  and  Earth  sciences  at  its  core.
This  shift  in  mission  will  enable  the  staff  and  collaborating  agencies  and
entities  a  freer  rein  on  educating,  engaging,  and  enabling  the  real-world
user communities that can benefit from NASA data, information, and serv-
ices.  Currently,  the  mission  and  philosophy  of  the  Agency,  demonstrated  by  reduc-
tions  in  funding  and  other  resources,  is  crippling  NASA’s  potential  in  these  areas.
Morale of Earth science personnel has been witnessed to be significantly degraded
from  that  of  the  previous  years  in  previous  administrations.  It  would  be  trivial  for
Congress  to  validate  these  statements  by  inviting  various  witnesses  from  the  God-
dard  Space  Flight  Center  and  NASA  Headquarters,  or  any  number  of  other  NASA
facilities.

To propel NASA onto a positive stage for engaging with the user commu-
nity on both a widespread and deeply integrated fashion, the following ini-
tiatives are recommended for consideration and further engagement begin-
ning no later than FY 2008. These initiatives are not exhaustive of the opportuni-
ties available, but have been identified due to the persistence and growth in sophis-
ticated  use  of  Earth  observation  data  by  the  user  communities  and  for  their  highly
visible and marketable value.

the  world.  The  Green  Belt  Movement 

Africa 
at

paign that directly applies the satellite technology to investigate the areas of
deforestation and land use degradation that require priority attention. GBM’s
use of satellite data and information can be directly linked to a litany of key
application areas, including:

Æ reforestation
Æ water resources,
Æ disease vector monitoring,
Æ disaster mitigation and response,
Æ food security,
Æ women and girls education, and
Æ biodiversity protection and management, as well as
Æ the burgeoning enterprise of carbon for poverty reduction (CPR).

The world stature of Dr. Maathai and the potential impact of GBM is of such
importance that NASA should consider this a priority focus for engage-
ment and support in 2008.

• Planet  Action—Launched  on  the  5th  of  June  by  Spot  Image  (see  attached
flier  www.planet-action.org),  this  initiative,  to  focus  on  climate  change  re-
search,  relies  upon  application  of  multiple  decades  of  time-series  satellite
data.  Projects  and  programs  to  be  associated  with  Planet  Action  will  require
a  research  component  and  connection  with  local  communities  impacted  by
challenges of climate change. Results from projects will be shared through an
open, Digital Earth Exchange platform. The focus areas include:

Æ Vegetation, biodiversity & ecosystems
Æ Oceans
Æ Ice & snow cover
Æ Drought, desertification & water resources
Æ Human dimensions & habitation

Currently,  this  initiative  is  engaged  in  collaboration  dialogues  with  strategic
partners,  including  the  Environmental  Systems  Research  Institute,  World
Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, Digital Globe, GeoEye, Heinz Cen-
ter, the European Space Agency, and many others. Planet Action will be oper-
ated by a separate non-profit entity beginning in 2008.

• Millennium Water Alliance—This alliance was formed four years ago to en-
able collaborative actions for delivering safe drinking water and sanitation to
the  two  billion  people  lacking  access  to  both  (www.mwawater.org).  The  lead-
ing  water  NGOs  are  cooperating  but  lack  the  technical  infrastructure  to  en-
able  field  coordination  and  effective  knowledge  of  geo-hydrologic  regimes
around  the  planet.  This  alliance  represents  a  prime  target  for  NASA  to  en-
gage  with  and  begin  making  real  progress  in  applying  its  data  and  informa-
tion into the existing global community.

It  is  sincerely  hoped  that  through  the  Committee’s  oversight  and  hearings  that
a  significant  shift  in  focus  and  effectiveness  can  be  brought  to  a  previously  re-
nowned  agency.  Leadership  and  demonstrative  results,  as  well  as  strategic  engage-
ment  with  key  enterprises  around  the  Nation  and  the  world,  are  clearly  needed  in
NASA.  Making  science  knowledge  actionable  should  become  the  proud  tradition  of
NASA  and  the  ESAP.  Hopefully,  the  input  provided  by  this  witness  may  help  con-
tribute to this goal.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Foresman,  and  I  thank  the

panel for a very compelling and stimulating set of testimony.

We  will  now  open  our  first  round  of  questions.  The  Chair  will

recognize himself for five minutes.

BALANCE IN THE EARTH SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS

PROGRAM

I  wanted  to  turn  to  Dr.  Anthes  and  Dr.  Barron  initially.  Dr.
Freilich’s testimony asserts that NASA’s budget request supports a
balanced  program.  Do  you  agree  based  on  the  recommendations  of
the  Decadal  Survey,  and  if  not,  what  aspects  of  the  program  are
out of balance?

Dr. Anthes, why don’t we start with you?
Dr. ANTHES. Yes. I would not say it is not balanced but it is just
not  enough.  You  can  see  that  the  purchasing  power,  the  invest-
ments in Earth science at NASA has decreased by 30 percent since
the 2001 levels, and that is not enough to do even the minimal pro-
gram  that  we  are  talking  about.  I  think  it  is  more  a  question  of
too little rather than not a balance.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Barron.
Dr. BARRON. I completely agree.
Chairman UDALL. Dr. Freilich.
Dr.  FREILICH.  I  thank  my  colleagues  for  recognizing  the  balance
in  the  program.  I  point  out  that  we  operate  14  satellites  now  and
we  have  seven  more  in  development  that  will  launch  off  by  2013.
The size of the Earth Science budget is itself determined from a se-
ries of balance calculations across the disciplines in NASA and be-
tween  NASA  and  other  agencies.  It  is  my  job  to  get  the  best
science, the best applications on the resources that are made avail-
able.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  you  for  that  succinct  and  to  the  point
set  of  answers.  I  think  we  may  turn  back  to  this  at  some  point
later in the hearing.

STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE SENSORS

REMOVED FROM NPOESS

I  do  want  to  turn  to  NPOESS,  Dr.  Freilich,  and  talk  a  bit  about
the  status  of  the  strategies  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  removing  the
climate sensors from NPOESS. Maybe I will leave that as an open-
ended question to you and ask you to respond.

Dr.  FREILICH.  Okay.  Thank  you.  As  you  know,  it  was  just  about
a  year  ago  when  because  of  a  series  of  technical  and  budgetary
issues  the  NPOESS  program  was  refocused  on  its  core  weather
forecasting  objectives,  and  that  resulted  in  the  demanifestation  of
several  climate  sensors  and  degradation  of  some  others  which  are
important for the Nation’s scientific and applications programs. Al-
most  immediately  after  that  and  before  I  joined  NASA  at  head-
quarters,  NASA  and  NOAA  working  together  with  the  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy  began  an  in-depth  study  of  the  cli-
mate  impact  of  those  demanifestations  and  degradations,  and  that
was  presented  in  early  January,  and  we  ranked  from  that  the  top
measurements  that  were  required  to  be  remanifested  based  on
science  issues,  and  you  are  well  aware  of  that,  and  we  are  moving
forwards to that. Subsequently, we have been working with NOAA
and  OSTP  in  order  to  develop  mitigation  scenarios  and  associated
costs, and this is a work in progress still in order to get those capa-
bilities  back  in  a  realistic  schedule,  a  realistic  budgetary  environ-
ment  and  addressing  the  science  and  the  applications.  In  April,
NASA and NOAA got together and jointly funded the remanifesta-
tion  of  the  Ozone  Limb  system  on  the  NPOESS  Preparatory
Project.  So  to  sum  up,  we  are  working  very,  very  closely  and  very
intensely with NOAA under OSTP guidance to understand the im-
pacts  of  the  Nunn-McCurdy  refocusing  and  to  develop  scenarios  to
regain those capabilities.

MAINTAINING CLIMATE INSTRUMENT TEAMS

Chairman  UDALL.  Could  I  ask  more  specifically,  what  are  your
plans  for  maintaining  the  teams  developing  the  climate  instru-
ments such as the TSIS as you do the work to find mitigation strat-
egies and the way forward?

Dr.  FREILICH.  In  the  area  of—for  instance,  in  the  area  of  total
solar  irradiance  measurements,  the  Glory  mission,  which  will  be
launching  late  in  2008  or  early  2009,  is  primarily  an  aerosol  mis-
sion but it also includes a total solar irradiance monitor, which will
continue that time series which is critical to have on-orbit overlap.
So in many instances, some of the measurements and missions that
we  have  under  development  now  will  continue  and  extend  those
time  series  and  those  teams  are  in  part  participating  in  the  devel-
opment of those missions.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  My  time  is  expired.  I  am  now

pleased to recognize Mr. Feeney for five minutes.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

NASA’S PLANS WITH RESPECT TO RESOURCES

Dr. Anthes, Barron and Foresman, you have heard Dr. Freilich’s
testimony  about  NASA’s  approach  going  forward.  Given  the  fact
that we have some limited resources and there are constraints that
all  three  of  you  are  concerned  about,  given  that  reality,  do  you
think that programmatically NASA is taking the appropriate steps
and  do  you  have  any  guidance  for  NASA,  again  given  the  reality
of the limited resources that you pointed out?

Dr. Anthes, why don’t you start?

63

Dr. ANTHES. I think we have given NASA about all the guidance
that  they  need  at  the  moment  through  the  Decadal  Survey.  That
was  a  two  and  one-half  year  study  by  over  100  people.  But  again,
I  get  back  to  the  point  that  NASA  is  doing  a  good  job  with  what
they have but they just don’t have enough, and for—you know, we
are talking about just going back to the 2001-2002 level, that is $2
per person per year in the United States. That is the price of a bad
cup  of  coffee.  And  so  I  think  this  is  affordable.  I  mean,  this  is  not
an  unreasonable  request  to  ask  for—to  NASA  to  ask  the  Adminis-
tration  or  the  Administration  to  ask  Congress  or  Congress  to  sup-
ply the resources needed to do our minimal recommended program.

CONTINUITY OF CLIMATE OBSERVATIONS, DATA GAPS, AND

SENSOR CALIBRATIONXXXXXX

Dr. BARRON. I would like to just add to that that I think we have
to find a way to fix this issue of climate continuity of these observa-
tions  so  that  every  time  it  is  not  a  stopgap  effort.  There  were  a
large number of reports and a large amount of effort that suggested
that NPOESS was going to present problems for climate quality ob-
servations  and  it  is  as  if  each  time  your  worse  nightmare  arrives
one  more  time  and  you  go  through—you  go  through  this  and  even
in writing the Decadal Survey, it was like a moving target to watch
things dropping off and questioning what was going to happen and
how  it  was  going  to  be  done  and  now  we  are  going  to  add  studies.
We  are  going  to  take  a  solar  measurement  that  gets  us  part  of  it
but  not  everything.  Each  one  of  these  components  in  terms  of  this
record  will  be  examined  but  nowhere  in  there  I  think  is  the  sense
that  we  are  actually  going  to  fix  this  so  that  we  can  actually  sit
here and argue about how we are going to make improvements and
advances, how we might be able to save money through efficiencies,
how  we  might  be  able  to  do  a  better  job  of  designing  an  observing
system  because  instead  the  most  basic  and  fundamental  set  of  ob-
servations  for  the  climate  system  are  in  jeopardy  one  more  time,
and  so  I  think  that  a  lot  of  analysis  on  how  to  maintain  parts  of
that is not the issue. We have a bigger issue to fix.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Foresman, you have to push——
Dr.  FORESMAN.  Thank  you.  I  certainly  agree  with  their  com-
ments.  I  would  relate  mine  to  the  other  95  percent  of  the  commu-
nity  outside  the  scientific  domain  in  terms  of  I  feel  that  NASA
could  do  much  better  in  terms  of  being  able  to  connect  and  out-
reach  with  innovation,  industry  partnerships,  academic  partner-
ships  and  NGO  partnerships  that  heretofore  have  not  been  made
available,  but  again,  as  I  emphasized,  the  technologies  that  are
now  changing  the  landscape  are  but  two  years  old,  and  if  NASA
is  not  prepared  within  their  staff  and  experience  at  the  current
time to address how that strategically impacts what they should be
doing to deliver to every district in this nation and citizens that lie
within there.

Mr. FEENEY. Dr. Freilich, given Dr. Barron’s point about the con-
tinuity  of  some  of  the  programs,  there  is  a  risk  that  some  of  our
current satellites that are operating well past their design life may
expire  before  replacements  are  launched.  How  serious  would  the
consequences  of  a  data  gap  for  a  year  or  two  be  in  terms  of  our

64

mission  and  talk  about  the  risks  of  calibrating  new  sensors  in
terms of that continuity that Dr. Barron was concerned about.

Dr.  FREILICH.  I  could  deliver  a  lengthy  treatise  as  my  academic
background is asking me to do but I will refrain from that for your
benefit.  The  need  for  continuity  and  the  approaches  to  calibration
and validation either on orbit overlap or vicarious calibration differ
from  quantity  to  quantity  and  measurement  to  measurement.  Let
me  focus  for  an  illustrative  example  on  total  solar  irradiance.  We
have  a  23-year-plus  time  series  of  measurements  of  the  sun’s
broadband  output.  We  can  make  very,  very  stable  and  very  sen-
sitive  instruments  but  we  can’t  absolutely  calibrate  them  on  the
ground.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  for  that  measurement  that  we
have  on-orbit  overlap  of  six  to  12  months  so  that  the  time  series
can  be  made  consistent  and  we  can  understand  whether  changes
are  owing  to  the  changes  in  the  sun  or  changes  in  the  instrument
when we weren’t measuring and therefore, for instance, that is why
we have put a total solar irradiance monitor on the Glory mission,
which is due to launch in late 2008 or early 2009 to assure overlap
with  our  existing  instruments,  for  instance,  SORCE.  Consistency
and  continuity,  where  our  understanding  and  our  predictions  are
sensitive to it, is number one on our list because it is essential for
us to redeem the Nation’s previous investment in these time series
by  continuing  them  where  necessary.  In  some  areas  we  could  sur-
vive with a gap or a degradation and do calibrations using transfer
standards.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  time  is  expired  but  if  the  chair-
man  would  agree,  I  would  just  like  to  get  Dr.  Barron  to  respond
to  that  because  it  is  a  concern  that  you  raised  and  you  think  that
this is—what do you think of Dr. Freilich’s response?

Dr.  BARRON.  He  has  provided  a  good  answer  and  it  is  true  that
different rules and needs apply for different sensors but if you can
imagine  for  me  a  minute  having  a  system  in  which  we  say  oh,  we
are  about  to  lose  this  because  it  didn’t  work  here,  let  us  go  do
something  over  here,  or  if  something  fails  and  then  make  a  deci-
sion  that  you  are  going  to  do  something,  that  is  not  a  very  robust
system, and we have been arguing about how robust the system is
and  what  needs  to  be  done  to  make  it  more  robust  for  at  least  20
years, it seems to me, and it strikes me that we are in worse shape,
not  in  better  shape,  in  terms  of  designing  that  as  a  system.  So  I
agree that what he said is correct but I do not think that embodies
a strategy of how to put this problem aside so that you are not con-
tinually addressing what you need to do and what you need to add
because you have lost something here.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Barron and Dr. Freilich.
We  will  now  recognize  the  gentleman  from  Texas,  Mr.  Lampson,

for five minutes.

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think I share some of the frustrations that all of our colleagues
are  starting  to  express  more  and  more,  and  Dr.  Anthes,  I  think  I
would  have  probably  not  said  nearly  as  nicely  as  what  you  did
about  resources.  We  keep  hearing  time  and  time  again  the  com-
ments that NASA and other agencies as well make the best efforts
possible  with  the  resources  available.  I  think  that  is  a  huge  cop-
out and there are budgetary issues but we are teaching this nation

to  not  understand  about  science.  We  are  teaching  this  nation  that
we are not going to get a return if we invest in something that will
tell  us  something  about  our  future,  and  the  return  is  huge,  and  I
was sitting here thinking that this little statement behind me, how
indeed true that it is, that if we don’t step up to the plate and ex-
hibit  the  political  will  and  quit  copping  out  to  those  who  are  lead-
ing  us  without  that  vision—we  can  talk  words  but  we  have  to  im-
plement  it,  act  on  it,  and  I  think  there  is  an  interest  on  the  part
of our Congress to do that. We need guidance from the science com-
munity,  we  need  guidance  from  this  public,  and  the  public  itself
needs  to  be  taught,  I  believe,  how  to  respond  to  us  so  that  we  can
become  the  followers  of  them  and  hopefully  put  the  resources
where  we  need  them.  I  am  going  to  try  to  ask  a  whole  bunch  of
questions  in  a  very  short  period  of  time  so  short  answers,  please,
gentlemen.

TRANSITIONING RESEARCH SATELLITES AND MEASUREMENTS

INTO OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS

Dr.  Freilich,  the  Earth  Sciences  Decadal  Survey  discusses  the
need  for  transitioning  research  satellites  and  measurements  into
operational systems. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 calls for
NASA and NOAA coordination on research to operation. How often
has NASA–NOAA joint working group met and when was the most
recent meeting?

Dr. FREILICH. The joint working group, which is one of many spe-
cific groups, met twice during 2006, and I believe that the most re-
cent  meeting  was  in  April  of  2006.  It  was  a  multi-day  workshop.
However, there are many other meetings periodically that we have
and  regularly.  There  is  a  tri-agency  altimeter  working  group,  and
as  I  pointed  out,  NASA  and  NOAA  have  gotten  together  and  re-
manifested the OMPS–Limb sensor on——

Mr. LAMPSON. This committee met a year and a half ago almost.

What specific issues has it addressed?

Dr.  FREILICH.  The  joint  working  group  has  five  specific  issues
that  it  addresses  and  it  focuses  on  transition  of  measurements,
transition  of  missions  that  are  on  orbit  and  issues  associated  with
data set, stewardship and climate records.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Is  the  joint  working  group  with  NOAA  able  to  ef-

fectively plan for transitions from research to operations?

Dr. FREILICH. We face a real challenge as a country in doing that
transition  and  there  are  very  few  successful  and  rapid  transitions.
However,  with  guidance  from  the  National  Research  Council—and
Dr.  Anthes  in  fact  authored  the  CONNTRO  report  to  the  Com-
mittee  on  NASA–NOAA  from  research  to  operations.  People  at
NASA  and  at  NOAA  are  very  sensitive  to  this  issue.  The  National
Research Council has set out a path forward and the joint working
group and the other working groups are leading us along that path.
We are making progress.

Mr. LAMPSON. Would any of the other witnesses care to comment

on any of those questions?

Dr.  ANTHES.  It  is  a  very  good  question.  It  is  a  very  tough  prob-
lem,  this  transition  from  research  to  operations.  I  hate  to  keep
whining  about  not  enough  resources  but,  you  know,  it  takes  re-
sources to transition these new technologies into NOAA operations,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

66

and  NOAA’s  budget  has  been  relatively  flat,  even  declining,  and
they  simply  don’t  have  the  resources  to  transition  even  the  sim-
plest,  even  some  of  the  cheapest  new  technologies  into  operations.
So this is a really big issue, as Dr. Freilich says, and we just have
to  come  to  grips  with  there  is  no  plan,  there  is  no  national  plan,
it  is  not  going  well.  Partly  it  is  due  to  the  fact  that  NOAA  doesn’t
have  the  resources  to  take  on  these  huge  responsibilities  and  so  it
is  not  just  simply  one  agency  problem.  It  is  a  two-agency  problem.
Mr.  LAMPSON.  The  yellow  light  is  on.  If  I  start  into  this,  it  is
going to take me a few more minutes, so I will yield back my time
now and——

Mr. FEENEY. If there is no objection. Go ahead.
Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Lampson,  why  don’t  you  take  a  couple

more minutes?

Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you very much.

FOLLOW-ON TO NASA’S QUIKSCAT SATELLITE

For Dr. Anthes and Dr. Barron, according to a recent article, sci-
entists exploring options for QuikSCAT success in Space News, the
new director of the National Hurricane Center has emphasized the
need  to  plan  for  a  replacement  to  NASA’s  QuikSCAT  satellite
should  it  fail.  The  Decadal  Survey  proposes  a  follow-on  to
QuikSCAT  but  not  until  2013  at  the  earliest.  What  is  the  reason
for  the  timing  of  the  Extended  Ocean  Vector  Winds  Mission,
XOVWM,  and  how  urgent  do  you  believe  the  situation  with
QuikSCAT is?

Dr.  BARRON.  I  think  you  see  that  what  the  Decadal  Survey  did
was put a whole group of very important missions on the table and
at the same time we tried to live within a very specific budget con-
straint  which  wasn’t  give  us  more,  give  us  more,  give  us  more,  it
was get us back to where we were in 2001 and 2002. Now, you only
have  one  choice  there.  You  have  put  a  list  there  and  you  have  to
put  them  in  time,  in  some  sequence  and  so  you  will  see  that  one
particular mission that focuses on one critical topic is delayed to a
later date because of hope that something will continue or because
something  else  in  another  part  of  the  world  is  going  to  contribute
some  information,  but  there  really  was  within  that  envelope  no
choice  and  I  think  what  you  see  too  is,  there  is  nothing  added  to
that  in  terms  of  true  innovations  on  that  list.  It  is  just  basically
to  fit  things  in  as  best  we  could  that  were  critical.  At  least  that  is
my view.

Dr.  ANTHES.  I  can  only  add  a  little  bit  to  that.  There  is  a  Euro-
pean scatterometer in place called ASCAT, which although not pro-
viding  the  level  of  accuracy  that  some  people  would  wish  at  least
is  an  interim  scatterometer  that  will  provide  some  of  the  informa-
tion needed for the ocean vector winds that are important for hurri-
cane forecasting.

Mr. LAMPSON. And we are also going to rely on the Russians for
moving  our  men  and  women  to  and  from  the  International  Space
Station, and who else are we going to be relying on into the future?
What  advances  would  the  XOVWM  mission  offer  over  QuikSCAT?
And I am going to ask——

Dr.  ANTHES.  This  is  his—he  is  an  expert  in  scatterometry  so  he

should——

Dr.  FREILICH.  I  am  very  proud  of  QuikSCAT.  I  was  the  mission
principal investigator for it so allow me. The XOVWM mission that
was recommended by the Decadal Survey primarily has higher res-
olution  in  space  so  it  measures  more  fine  short-scale  variations  in
the  wind  field  and  it  will  have  the  ability  to  make  measurements
that  are  accurate  under  raining  and  severe  conditions  which
present  systems  cannot  do.  So  we  will  be  able  to  get  closer  to  the
coast.  We  will  be  able  to  measure  smaller-scale  wind  variations
when  the  NOAA  XOVWM  mission  flies,  and  we  will  be  able  to
make  measurements  that  are  accurate  under  extreme  conditions
and rain.

Mr. LAMPSON. My last thing, and it is short and I appreciate the
indulgence  of  the  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member,  I  sent  a  letter
regarding  the  NASA–NOAA  research  to  operations  working  group
report  asking  for  that.  It  was  supposed  to  have  been  here  on  Feb-
ruary  15.  NASA  sent  it  for  clearance,  I  think,  earlier  this  month.
Do  you  have  any  idea  when  I  might  be  able  to  expect  delivery  of
that?

Dr.  FREILICH.  I  am  relatively  new  to  the  Federal  Government
and  I  am  learning  a  lot.  I  can  tell  you  that  substantive  work  on
the text of that report ended many, many weeks ago and it is work-
ing  its  way  through  the  agency  and  interagency  review  process.  I
will  take  an  action  to  get  back  to  you.  I  think  that  it  is  imminent
but I can’t say with certainty. I am sorry.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  My  fear  is  that  we  have  become  such  a—almost
a bloated bureaucracy that we can’t move and somehow, I think as
some of you have stated, Dr. Foresman and others, we have got to
find a way around that. We have got too much at stake for our fu-
ture.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Lampson. That was a very im-
portant  line  of  questioning,  and  Dr.  Freilich,  I  hope  that  you  will
respond  to  Dr.  Lampson—or  Mr.  Lampson  as  soon  as  possible.
There is a Dr. Lampson. It turns out it is Nick’s brother.

TOTAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE SENSOR (TSIS)—MAINTAINING
THE TEAM AND POTENTIAL INCLUSION ON LANDSAT DATA
CONTINUITY MISSION

If I could, Dr. Freilich, I want to go back to the discussion of cli-
mate  instrument  teams.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  Glory  in-
strument contracts are winding down, as important as that project,
set of projects is. What specifically will NASA be doing to maintain
the  TSIS  team  for  the  remainder  of  2007—fiscal  year  2007  and
through 2008 while OSTP is deciding what to do?

Dr.  FREILICH.  I  can’t  give  you  any  specifics,  sir,  beyond  the  fact
that  although  the  contracts—although  the  work,  the  development
work  on  those  instruments—that  instrument  is  in  fact  winding
down, because the instrument is being built and successfully deliv-
ered  and  integrated,  there  still  remains  a  lot  of  work  for  integra-
tion  tests  and  maintenance  of  that  followed  by  of  course  after
launch  validation  and  calibration  and  characterization  of  the  in-
strument.  I  don’t  have  the  specific  information  that  I  can  give  you
on TSIS. Again, we can find——

that specific information?

Dr.  FREILICH.  As  soon  as  I  can  get  back  and  within  a  couple  of

Chairman  UDALL.  Do  you  have  an  idea  when  you  might  have

days I will make inquiries. I am sorry.

Chairman UDALL. That is terrific. Thank you.
Let  me  continue  on  the  TSIS  line  of  questioning  in  the  context
of  some  broader  concerns.  NASA  officials  have  indicated  that  the
Landsat Data Continuity Mission is being considered as a potential
platform for TSIS, and how about a sense of when a decision might
be  made  on  that  option  and  how  would  adding  the  TSIS  affect  the
LDCM schedule and the duration of any potential gaps in the land
cover data record?

Dr.  FREILICH.  You  have  hit  the  high  points,  Mr.  Chairman.  You
are  well  informed.  The  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  is  de-
signed  principally  to  extend  the  30-year-plus  record  that  we  have
of  moderate-resolution  radiometry  over  and  imagery  of  land  sur-
faces.  It  has  been  an  incredibly  valuable  data  set.  At  present  we
have two spacecraft both flying well beyond their baseline lifetime.
LDCM  is  scheduled  for  launch  at  present  in  mid-2011,  designed
specifically to minimize the gap, and I am afraid that we will have
a  six  to  12-month  gap  in  that  long  time  series.  We  are  looking  at
using  that  platform  potentially  as  you  said  to  extend  some  other
critical  time  series  such  as  TSIS.  The  number  one  issue  that  is
guiding us there is in fact the schedule and the risk for minimizing
the  gap  on  the  time  series  of  the  land  imagery.  We  are  looking  at
lots  of  options  and  again  that  work  is  deeply  underway  and  has
been  for  several  months.  We  are  letting  four  contracts  for  LDCM
and  they  are  in  the  process  of  being  advertised  right  now  and  the
interaction  between  them  and  the  technical  addition  of  TSIS  will
govern our schedules and our decisions.

CLIMATE MEASUREMENTS AND ‘DECADAL SURVEY’ MISSIONS

Chairman  UDALL.  Let  me  follow  on  here.  What  role,  if  any,  will
the Decadal Survey missions have in addressing any potential gaps
in climate and environment measurements as a result of the Nunn-
McCurdy restructuring at NPOESS?

Dr.  FREILICH.  If  I  understand  your  question,  it  is  can  Decadal
Survey missions fill in for potential NPOESS demanifestations. Do
I have that correct?

Chairman UDALL. That is fair enough.
Dr.  FREILICH.  Okay.  The  Decadal  Survey  actually  was,  as  Dr.
Anthes  and  Dr.  Barron  said,  was  very  careful  in  not  overlapping
capabilities  for  the  Nation  so  in  fact  the  problem  turns  out  to  be
almost  an  opposite  one,  that  is,  the  NPOESS  refocusing  happened
late  in  the  Decadal  Survey  process  and  many  of  the  Decadal  Sur-
vey  missions  actually  rely  on  measurements  that  were  to  be  taken
by  NPOESS  as  opposed  to  duplicate  measurements  that  would  be
taken by NPOESS and one of the goals of our workshops is to actu-
ally  understand  what  contextual  measurements  that  would  have
been  made  by  NPOESS  are  necessary  for  the  Decadal  Survey
science so that we will advance the science.

Chairman  UDALL.  Perhaps  I  could  just  take  another  minute  and
ask  Dr.  Anthes  or  Dr.  Barron  if  they  care  to  comment  on  the  last
question.

Dr. ANTHES. Well, there were two recommendations for NOAA in
the very early time frame, the 2010 to 2013, that have great bear-
ing  on  climate.  One  is  the  CLARREO  mission,  which  is  to  do
benchmark  climate  radiation  observations.  The  climate  fundamen-
tally is warming because there is an imbalance between what radi-
ation  we  are  receiving  from  the  sun  and  what  is  being  either  re-
flected  back  or  emitted  back  and  so  we  need  a  set  of  benchmark
radiation  observations  that  will  measure  not  only  what  the  sun  is
putting in but what is being reflected back and what is being emit-
ted  back  from  the  Earth.  The  other  instrument  that  is  rec-
ommended  in  this  very  early  time  frame  is  the  GPS  radio  occulta-
tion  measurements,  which  make  very  accurate  and  precise  meas-
urements  of  the  temperature  and  water  vapor  structure  of  the  at-
mosphere.  Again,  these  would  be  benchmark  climate  observations
that  will  tell  us  how  fast  the  atmosphere  is  warming  up,  where  it
is  warming  up  the  fastest  and  how  the  water  vapor  is  increasing
regionally  and  globally.  So  these  are  two  relatively  inexpensive
missions  that  can  be  launched  by  2010  and  will  contribute  to  the
very essential climate observations.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Barron, anything else to add?
Dr.  BARRON.  Yes,  those—I  completely  agree  with  Dr.  Anthes.
Those  are  extremely  important.  And  I  would  also,  you  know,  like
to  confirm  what  Dr.  Freilich  said.  As  Chair  of  the  climate  panel,
we  sat  there  with  an  assumption  that  we  had  a  basic  set  of  obser-
vations  long  planned  through  NPOESS  that  would  continue  and
that our objective was to build upon that. Where are the great un-
certainties  in  climate  models?  How  can  we  make  observations  to
make  improvements?  And  in  particular  in  the  latter  half  of  the
Decadal  Survey,  every  meeting  of  my  panel  it  seemed  we  had  to
reassess what was the base that we were building upon because we
were  moving  from  a  situation  of  instead  of  proposing  innovative
ideas  to  tackle  important  problems,  we  were  trying  to  make  sure
we were going to not lose what we have had for decades.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, and Mr. Feeney is recognized.
Mr. FEENEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, INCLUDING CHALLENGES OF

ITAR

Congressman  Lampson  raised  the  international  reliance  and  co-
operation  issue.  Dr.  Freilich,  obviously  there  are  some  advantages
including  avoiding  duplication  of  services  and  reducing  costs  with
cooperation. Your statement suggests that there are some bilateral
discussions underway with several partner agencies. Is the concept
to  have  other  countries  assume  full  responsibility  for  designing,
building  and  operating  individual  missions  and  then  sharing  the
data  or  to  have  one  or  several  partners  participate  in  individual
missions or is it a combination? I guess it would be helpful to, you
know, see where we are going with the bilateral agreements.

Dr. FREILICH. Excellent point. The answer is, it is a combination.
First  let  me  say  that  the  Decadal  Survey  very  specifically  points
out  the  need  to  leverage  our  capabilities  with  those  of  our  inter-
national  partners.  It  points  out  that  the  scope  of  the  problem  and
the scope of the solution is far greater than what any single agency
or any single country can do. It turns out that our Decadal Survey

70

scientists  are  completely  in  line  and  leading  in  fact  the  global  cli-
mate science and Earth systems science community so our aims in
NASA  are  well  aligned  with  the  aims  of  our  partner  agencies  in
other  countries.  Having  said  that,  in  many  of  our  discussions  we
are  talking  about  contributions  from  an  instrument  standpoint
from  multiple  countries  to  a  particular  mission  but  we  are  also
spending  extra  amounts  of  time  to  talk  about  trading  missions.  If
a mission can be flown from a particular country and the data are
freely  available  and  well  characterized,  then  it  aids  everybody  in
our  analyses  and  therefore  we  don’t  have  to  duplicate  those  meas-
urements simply to say that we were making them as well. The re-
sources  are  limited,  the  problem  scope  is  large  and  we  really  have
to have unique application of our resources, not duplicative. Having
said that, we are trying all possible permutations.

Mr.  FEENEY.  And  as  you  enter  and  participate  in  these  negotia-

tions, how will ITAR regulations hinder or impede your efforts?

Dr.  FREILICH.  ITAR  presents  challenges.  We  conform  with  the
ITAR  regulations  and  I  am  intimately  familiar  with  several  inter-
national  collaborations.  Like  I  said,  ITAR  presents  challenges  but
we  can  surmount  them.  We  are  going  to  be  flying,  for  instance—
we  have  altimeter  missions  joint  with  the  French  agency  CNES
that  have  been  very  successful  and  we  will  be  launching  OSTM  in
June  of  2008.  We  will  be  flying  the  first  ever  sea  surface  salinity
measurement  mission  with  our  Argentine  colleagues’  space  agency
CONAE,  and  that  will  be  launching  in  the  2009  time  frame  as
presently  listed.  So  ITAR  is  challenging  but  it  can  be  surmounted
and we do obey the ITAR regulations.

Mr.  FEENEY.  And  finally,  Dr.  Anthes,  you  have  mentioned  some
of  the  international  cooperation  components  to  accomplishing  the
overall goals. What do you think about ITAR and the potential hin-
drance it poses?

Dr.  ANTHES.  As  Dr.  Freilich  said,  they  can  be  significant,  and
then  some  kinds  of  technologies  they  can  actually  prevent  inter-
national collaboration. International collaboration, as I said, is—we
have  to  consider  that  carefully  but  at  some  point,  I  think  as  Mr.
Lampson implied, the United States can’t rely entirely on other na-
tions  to  make  these  critical  observations.  It  would  be  a  little  bit
like having a military that relied on international partnerships. We
certainly  need  to  do  some  partnerships  but  I  think  that  some  of
these  key  observations  we  cannot  assume  that  these  partnerships
will be there or will be successful.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Thank  you.  I  appreciate  everybody’s  testimony  and

I yield back my time.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Lampson.
Mr. LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We also have to be real cautious, I believe, with our international
partners  when  we  enter  into  arrangements.  There  seems  to  more
and  more  opportunity  for  us  to  find  some  way  to  renege  in  some
of  those.  One  I  have  in  mind  that  doesn’t  impact  any  of  you,  the
AMS  Project,  which  is  a  $1.2  billion  project  that  has  been  95  per-
cent paid for by international partners, and our promise was to put
it  on  the  space  station,  and  at  this  point  it  is  no  longer  on  the
manifest  to  be  able  to  go  to  the  space  station.  Those  folks  are  not
happy  campers.  And  so  if  we  expect  to  be  able  to  enter  into  these

71

arrangements,  which  I  think  are  critically  important,  I  don’t  see
how  there  is  any  better  way  for  us  to  build  friendships  than  by
working on things that benefit the people of both or more countries.
We  just  have  to  be  able  to  be  cautious  with  what  we  do,  what  our
plans are.

I  don’t  have  a  question  in  any  of  that.  I  think  I  started  a  rant
a little while ago. I love NASA. I love the science agencies that we
have  in  this  nation  and  I  want  to  do  things  that  can  bring  atten-
tion  to  the  magnificent  accomplishments  that  they  make  and  peo-
ple  that  have  the  bright  minds  that  are  making  those  and  to  con-
tinue to be able to support them in a bigger and better way. I think
it is important for us to point out that right now NASA has a budg-
et that is six-tenths of a percent of the Nation’s budget, and in the
1960s when we were having magnificent achievement in education
and  in  technological  advances,  the  budget  for  NASA  was  six  per-
cent of our nation’s budget, a significant difference in commitment,
and  that  is  something  that  I  hope  and  pray  that  we  can  get  back
to  as  a  Congress,  as  a  nation  and  as  a  scientific  community,  and
with that, I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Lampson,  I  might  ask  you  to  yield.  We
could  use  a  little  bit  of  your  time.  I  know  we  have  had  conversa-
tions  about  the  AMS  Project  and  the  important  work  that  would
be  done  in  this  very  fascinating  area  of  antimatter  and  I  think  we
have  some  opportunities  in  July  to  question  NASA  about  their
plans  in  this  regard.  Gentlemen,  I  look  forward  to  working  with
you  to  further  understand  why  we  can’t  see  that  this  important
project  be  undertaken.  I  think  you  and  I  have  some  additional
plans to pursue this.

Mr.  LAMPSON.  Indeed,  and  I  appreciate  your  interest  in  it  but  I
tried  to  mention  that  only  to  let  it  be  a  part  of  this  big  picture  of
what  we  are  not  doing  right  now.  There  are  too  many  times  when
we  take  and  make  the  excuse  of  we  can’t  get  the  resources  to  do
something.  If  it  is  important  for  us  as  a  Nation,  as  a  people,  we
ought  to  find  the  resources.  We  did  once  before  and  we  got  an  un-
believable  return  for  it,  and  that  is  what  I  am  looking  for.  That  is
what I want to see my government doing for this nation. It is with-
in us. We have got to have the leadership to make it happen.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  yielding  to  me  and

I would yield back to him if he——

Mr.  LAMPSON.  And  I  will  yield  my  time  back.  Thank  you,  Mr.

Chairman.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  The  Chair  will  recog-

nize himself for five minutes.

PLANS FOR FUTURE OBSERVATIONS SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS

SOCIETAL NEEDS

I  did  want  to  return  to  Dr.  Freilich  but  also  give  Dr.  Foresman
a heads-up that we haven’t been ignoring him and I wanted to give
him  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  question  I  am  going  to  ask
Dr.  Freilich.  What  I  want  to  focus  on  was  the  Academy’s  survey,
the  Decadal  Survey  stressed  the  need  for  observation  systems  to
look  at  both  scientific  and  societal  needs,  and  I  want  to  just  give
you  a  chance  to  talk  about  NASA’s  planning  process  for  future  ob-
servation systems takes into account this important area of societal

72

needs.  When  you  are  finished,  I  would  like  to  give  Dr.  Foresman
an opportunity to comment as well.

Dr. FREILICH. Our missions are the basis—they provide the hard
measurements and the information. The research and analysis pro-
gram develops scientific-based understanding of the Earth as a sys-
tem  using  modeling  as  well  as  those  measurements.  Our  Applied
Sciences  program  serves  as  what  I  call  a  flexible  bridge  between
the  knowledge  that  we  gain  in  the  research  and  analysis  program
and  the  need  for  focused  information  to  address  societal  benefit
areas  and  very  specifically,  our  Applied  Sciences  program  is  de-
signed  to  further  that  communication  between  the  science  under-
standing  that  is  driven  by  the  missions  and  the  need  for  services
and information by others who are dealing specifically with societal
benefit areas. The focus of the Applied Sciences program is becom-
ing  aligned  with  US  GEO,  the  Group  on  Earth  Observations,  and
their  nine  societal  benefit  areas.  In  each  one  of  those  areas,  we
have  pilot  projects  in  which  we  demonstrate  the  utility  of  the
NASA  measurements  and  understanding  to  further  other  agency
and other organizations’ goals in their—for their objectives. So very
specifically,  the  Applied  Sciences  program  forms  that  connection
between  the  science  and  the  societal  benefit  areas.  We  are  aligned
with US GEO, and as I pointed out, we are playing a very key role
in  the  international  Committee  on  Earth  Observing  Satellites
which is the coordinating arm for the global GEO.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  And  I  want  to  turn  Dr.  Foresman
and  I  think  particularly  ask  Dr.  Foresman  to  outline  some  exam-
ples  of  how  this  very  powerful  technology  can  be  used.  I  had  ob-
tained recently, Dr. Foresman, a radio story about Darfur and how
actually  satellite  imagery  could  help  us  understand  on  a  real-time
basis what was happening there and would help us expand our ef-
forts to prevent what is clearly genocide and a very tragic situation
from further developing, and I know you had some other examples
in your testimony. So the floor is yours.

Dr.  FORESMAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  also  tends  to
reach  into  issues  of  international  cooperation  as  well,  so  it  is  not
just  restricted  to  the  United  States.  We  are  sitting  at  a  profound
point  in  history  where  we  can  view  these  various  radical,  if  you
will,  changes  in  terms  of  land  use  or  humanitarian  issues  around
the planet with regular citizens being able to engage. This is some-
thing  that  the  Applied  Science  program,  again  with  due  respect,
having been in that program and I know they did a lot of very good
things  but  the  bureaucratic  realities  tend  to  basically  dilute  the
ability  to  provide  rapid  response,  and  rapid  response  is  occurring
in  a  variety  of  sectors  at  a  rate  which  we  talked  about  into  the
hundreds  of  thousands  of  projects  that  are  showing  up  around  the
planet  that  unfortunately  is  beyond  the  scope  of  NASA  head-
quarters  to  address.  However,  by  restructuring,  it  could  have  the
potential  to  address  this  in  some  very  significant  ways.  You  know,
we  are  looking  at  deforestation  issues.  While  searching  for  better
algorithms for carbon, sometimes the academics spend time seques-
tering  their  information  to  be  published  while  the  forest  has  been
removed and so they come back and they find out that it is a moot
point, and this happens continuously. Reporting on how many trees
are there is a phenomenal area that we are still abjectly behind the

ball.  Recently  one  of  the  applications  was  done  in  Santa  Cruz,  not
known  as  a  developing  nation  but  Santa  Cruz,  California,  where
they were able to save 1,000 redwood trees in the backyard simply
by  providing  through  these  various  visualization  tools  that  I  am
speaking  of  that  NASA  was  the  leader  in  showing  the  community
what  was  going  on  with  1,000  trees  that  had  been  promulgated
through  the  official  channels  as  but  a  clear—a  logging  exercise  by
the watershed district. Well, it was a clear-cutting exercise to gain
monetary  benefit  to  a  watershed  district.  This  is  a  phenomenal
thing,  1,000  acres  of  redwood  trees  right  in  the  backyards  of  some
of  the  most  literate  and  intelligent  people  on  the  planet.  So  these
kinds  of  examples  are  showing  up  and  we  captured  many  of  those
in Berkeley with General Pete Worden, who was there in Berkeley
just  two  weeks  ago  with  me  highlighting  many  of  these  examples,
and  it  was  interesting  because  the  Google  executives  admitted—
and it wasn’t just Google, you know, I don’t have stock in that com-
pany—admitted that they can’t even contain what is going on. This
is an uncontrolled experiment. Well, it is an experiment that NASA
should  be  controlling  as  best  they  can  because  it  is  the  absolute
soft  spot.  It  is  where  the  rubber  meets  the  road  in  terms  of  how
to  transfer  our  science  and  knowledge  into  the  backyards  of  citi-
zens. And so we have a choice. There is two paths. We can sit back
and say well, it will happen and let us watch what happens, or we
can  say,  no,  this  is  the  time  for  leadership  and  to  really  gain  the
upper hand in these application areas because they are so profound
in  terms  of  mountaintop  removal,  for  our  energy  resources  in  our
country  in  terms  of  the  governance  by  indigenous  people  that  are
taking over water quality monitoring and sampling from the USGS
and  EPA  in  a  very  profound  way  and  a  great  example  of  the  com-
munities  taking  on  the  responsibility  for  stewardship  in  the  back-
yards,  and  the  tools  are  there  now  that  we  only  dreamed  of  seven
or eight years ago. They are here now and they are not part of the
plan. Thank you.

Chairman  UDALL.  Dr.  Barron,  would  you  like  to  comment  as

well?

Dr.  BARRON.  I  would.  I  think  it  is  an  extremely  important  ques-
tion, and to be perfectly blunt, I view the applications program side
of NASA a decade ago as throwing data over the transom and find-
ing out who might grab it. I view the current program as one which
is  directly  throwing  data  over  the  transom  where  you  are  sitting
there looking at a particular application use and making sure that
the  data  is  available.  But  I  think  we  forget  the  fact  that  there  is
actually  a  science  that  needs  to  be  accomplished  to  make  the  soci-
etal connections. You are sitting right now in a world in which cli-
mate  variability  is  having  a  big  influence  in  something  like  West
Nile  virus  delivered  by  a  mosquito  yet  you  are  sitting  there  ana-
lyzing  where  and  how  to  respond  in  hindsight  by  collecting  num-
bers  of  dead  birds  and  testing  them  when  we  have  the  capability
to  actually  couple  the  science  and  human  health  sciences  together
so  that  you  actually  start  to  forecast  the  outcomes  for  something
like  a  Dengue  fever  or  a  West  Nile  virus.  We  have  that  capability
in the short-term and the long-term if we can put the communities
together and to begin to set up the types of observations and mod-
eling that you need to do it. And by collecting observations and sit-

ting there thinking just as a climate scientist, you are not going to
make  that  accomplishment.  You  actually  have  to  bring  these  soci-
etal  connections  to  the  forefront  and  not  one  which  is  a  handoff  of
data but one that actually promotes scientific discovery and brings
that  same  discipline  of  forecasting  that  we  apply  to  weather  fore-
casting to something like human health forecasting.

Chairman  UDALL.  The  two  other  Committee  Members  that  are
here  inform  me  they  have  no  additional  questions.  I  did  have  one
additional  line  of  questioning  I  wanted  to  direct  to  the  panel,  then
we  will  draw  the  hearing  to  a  conclusion.  I  will  turn  back  to  Dr.
Freilich  but  I  would  like  everybody  else  on  the  panel  to  feel  free
to comment.

NASA’S FUTURE EARTH OBSERVATION MISSIONS AND INTE-
GRATING DECADAL SURVEY RECOMMENDATIONS, NPOESS
CHANGES, AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

Your  testimony  indicates  that  NASA’s  plan  for  future  Earth  ob-
serving  missions  will  integrate  the  scientific  recommendations  of
the Decadal Survey, the ongoing NPOESS Nunn-McCurdy changes
and  the  contributions  of  our  international  partners.  That  is  no
small task. Could you explain in specific terms how you plan to ac-
tually make that integrated approach a reality, and then if I could
thrown an additional two questions at you: What is the timeline for
that integrated plan and how does that timeline address any poten-
tial  data  gaps  as  a  result  of  the  restructuring,  the  Nunn-McCurdy
restructuring  of  NPOESS?  If  you  want  to  provide  some  of  this  for
the record, we would be happy to indulge you in that way well, but
if you want to take a shot right now, I would appreciate it.

Dr. FREILICH. Okay. I will take a shot at that. Before I start that,
may  I  have  your  lead  to  address  the  timeliness  of  some  of  our  Ap-
plied Sciences projects or——

Chairman UDALL. Sure. Please.
Dr.  FREILICH.  Dr.  Foresman  made  a  very  good  point  about  the
need  to  be  timely  in  order  to  actually  have  real  benefit,  and  Dr.
Barron  talked  about  throwing  directed  or  undirected  data  over  the
transom.  We  have  some  real  shining  stars  of  projects  in  the  Ap-
plied  Sciences  program  and  I  would  just  like  to  talk  about  two  or
maybe  one  to  start  with,  the  SERVIR  node,  which  is  a  data  envi-
ronmental monitoring synthesizing and distribution center that we
in Applied Sciences have set up in Central America to bring in not
only NASA data but also models from other agencies and to provide
the  information  that  is  necessary  for  decision-makers  in  the  Meso
American  area  to  actually  manage  the  environment  and  to  under-
stand. Just last month, I think it was around the 18th of May, we
were  contacted  by  the  environment  ministry  of  Honduras  where
there was a degradation in air quality and it was unclear whether
this was being caused by Saharan dust—they knew that there was
Saharan  dust  in  the  area—or  whether  it  was  being  caused  by
smoke,  and  the  response  in  Honduras  and  Nicaragua  and  Costa
Rica  would  be  quite  different.  In  just  a  matter  of  four  days,
SERVIR  took  data  from  our  flying  satellites,  including  the  rel-
atively  recently  launched  CALIPSO  satellite  which  measures
aerosols and clouds as well as data from MODIS, combined that in-
formation  with  models,  models  of  smoke  distribution,  fire  distribu-

tion, et cetera, many of which were generated in the United States,
and  provided  a  clear  description  to  the  affected  areas  that  in  fact
there was dust but it was located well to the east in the Caribbean
and  the  degradation  of  air  quality  that  they  were  seeing  was  re-
sulting  from  fires  which  were  relatively  local,  at  least  to  Central
America.  The  point  being  that  in  that  very  short  amount  of  time,
that NASA-sponsored project could provide the specific information
that was flexibly needed by that ministry.

Okay. Now let me answer your questions. Sorry about that. It is
a  big  task  to  pull  together  the  international  collaborations,  the
NPOESS  response  and  our  increased  understanding  of  the  tech-
nical and cost challenges of the missions. We are working on a time
scale that is focused informing the fiscal year 2009 process because
the Administration’s fiscal year 2009 budget process is the first one
that  is  going  to  be  fully  looking  at  the  detailed  recommendations
of  the  Decadal  Survey.  I  have  been  on  the  road  almost  constantly
for the last couple of months speaking with our international part-
ners  and  bringing  together  some  of  those  joint  science  working
groups.  We  actually  even  started  some  of  the  concept  studies  to
look at technical challenges and costs a little bit before the Decadal
Survey  came  out.  They  have  all  reported  to  us  once  and  we  are  in
the  final  stages  of  rationalizing  those  inputs  and  it  is  our  hope—
and you know what is happening with the NPOESS–OSTP–NASA–
NOAA  joint  deliberations.  They  are  all  focused  on  coming  up  with
at least the outlines of a plan and the associated resources in order
to  inform  the  Administration’s  development  of  the  fiscal  year  2009
budget  process.  So  we  are  moving  towards  a  fall—we  are  moving
towards a fall coalescence or synthesis for the integrated.

Chairman  UDALL.  Dr.  Anthes  or  Dr.  Barron,  did  you  have  any

interest in adding additional commentary to that?

Dr.  ANTHES.  Well,  I  think  it  is  good  that  they  are  seriously  con-
sidering  the  Decadal  Survey  but  it  is  going  to  take  more  than  re-
balancing, more than considering, more than a few workshops. Mr.
Lampson  is  right  on.  This  country  can’t  afford  not  to  do  it.  There
is  a  cost  for  doing  nothing.  We  are  talking  about,  I  mean,  some
lag—to  stabilize  greenhouse  emissions  in  the  United  States  might
cost  $30  billion.  That  is  just  annually.  Is  that  going  to  work?  How
do  we  know  that  is  happening?  Are  we  going  to  invest  $30  billion
in  something  that  won’t  work  or  we  can’t  observe  or  can’t  verify?
What about China? China is the greatest greenhouse gas emissions
country  right  now.  How  do  we  know  what  they  are  doing  and
whether  what  we  will  do  will  make  any  difference  compared  to
what they do? So the cost of doing nothing is huge. The cost of get-
ting on with observing this planet is very, very small. We just have
to do it.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you very much.
Dr. Barron, do you want to have the last word or should we leave

Rick with it?

Well, thank you all today for taking your valuable time to appear
before  the  Subcommittee.  We  look  forward  to  future  visits  on  the
part of all of you.

At  this  point  I  want  to  announce  if  there  is  no  objection,  the

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Michael  H.  Freilich,  Director,  Earth  Science  Division,  Science  Mission

Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Is  there  a  consensus  (among  federal  agencies,  academia,  and  other  users)  on  a
set of climate and environmental measurements to which the nation should com-
mit for sustained observations? If so, what is the set? If not, should there be such
a  set  of  consensus  measurements  and  what  would  be  involved  in  reaching  con-
sensus?

A1. There  is  a  National  consensus  on  the  set  of  climate  variables  documented  in
the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  CCSP  Strategic  Plan,  which  are  similar
to  the  internationally  agreed-upon  set  of  Essential  Climate  Variables  of  the  Global
Climate  Observing  System  (GCOS)  of  the  World  Climate  Research  Program
(WCRP).  The  set  is  made  up  of  approximately  40  different  climate  variables  cov-
ering oceans, atmospheres, the cryosphere, the biosphere, and chemistry.

Overall,  the  science  community  has  defined  a  relatively  complete  set  of  variables
and associated observation accuracy for each variable. Several reports have also con-
sidered and documented the required accuracy, stability, and overlap of observations
of these variables required to observe climate forcing, responses, and feedback (e.g.,
the U.S. multi-agency report from NASA, NOAA, EPA, and NPOESS Ohring et al.,
BAMS September 2005; and, the international GCOS Satellite Calibration Require-
ments Report). While the current observing systems are not fully capable of meeting
these  requirements,  the  recent  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  Decadal  Survey
recommended specific mission priorities to address this lack of full capability. In ad-
dition,  efforts  are  underway  in  NASA’s  research  program  to  develop  new  methods
to  prioritize  climate  observations  using  Observing  System  Simulation  Experiments
(OSSEs),  a  concept  analogous  to  weather  prediction  OSSEs,  but  based  on  climate
model physics and the ability to use climate observations to determine uncertainties
in climate model predictions.
Q2. The  value  of  Earth  observing  satellites  lies  in  the  data  and  measurements  they
collect.  Will  implementing  the  Decadal  Survey’s  recommended  missions  require
changes  to  NASA’s  data  management  systems?  If  so,  what  are  your  plans  for
making such changes?

A2. NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) has developed an extensive data system
architecture  capable  of  handling  data  ingest,  processing,  quality  control,  validation,
archive,  and  distribution.  The  system  is  distributed  across  major  data  centers  as
well as smaller data systems. The size of the systems is determined by data volume,
processing complexity, and user community needs. This distributed system has been
found to be the most robust and efficient method, and keeps data processing as close
as  possible  to  the  scientific  expertise  needed  in  its  creation,  validation,  and  quality
control.

The  missions  recommended  by  the  NRC  Decadal  Survey  for  Earth  Science  have
similar  overall  data  requirements,  compared  with  NASA’s  current  EOS  and  Earth
System Science Pathfinder missions, so they would be handled in a similar architec-
ture  to  the  current  NASA  satellites.  Many  of  the  NRC-recommended  satellites  do
have large data rates and processing requirements, so they will represent significant
extension of capability at current data centers and, in a few cases, may lead to new
data  centers.  Data  system  approaches  would  be  selected  to  most  efficiently  and
robustly  accomplish  the  NRC  Decadal  Study  missions.  For  example,  the  portion  of
the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission to
extend the Earth radiation budget satellite data would extend the capabilities of the
EOS-developed  Clouds  and  the  Earth’s  Radiant  Energy  System  (CERES)  radiation
budget  data  system  at  the  NASA  Langley  Atmospheric  Sciences  Data  Center.  Such
an approach takes full advantage of the previous NASA hardware and software de-
velopment  efforts,  and  ensures  a  low  risk  approach  to  achieving  the  NRC  rec-
ommended data sets.
Q3. The  decadal  survey  urges  the  continuation  of  the  currently  operating  Terra,
Aqua,  Aura,  and  SORCE  Earth  observation  satellites  for  as  long  as  possible  to
help  minimize  data  gaps  resulting  from  the  loss  of  NPOESS  climate  sensors.
What  is  the  current  plan  for  continuing  these  missions  and  how  long  are  they
expected to provide data?

A3. As recommended by the NASA Earth Science Senior Review conducted in April
2007,  the  Aqua,  Terra,  and  SORCE  missions  have  been  approved  and  budgeted  for
operation  through  2011.  The  Aura  mission  is  still  in  its  primary  mission  phase,
which  will  end  in  2010.  All  four  of  these  missions  will  be  examined  for  further  ex-
tension in the next Earth Science Senior Review, to be conducted during 2009.

The  Earth  Science  Division  within  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  reviews  the
status and performance of all of NASA’s Earth observing missions operating beyond
their  primary  mission  every  two  years  as  part  of  our  Senior  Review  process.  The
review process considers the satellite performance and instrument health, the value
of  the  observations  to  NASA  research  objectives,  as  well  as  to  all  National  oper-
ational agencies such as NOAA, the Department of Defense and the U.S. Geological
Survey,  among  others.  Terra,  Aqua  and  SORCE  were  included  in  the  most  recent
review, completed in April 2007. Aura was not included in the 2007 review because
that mission is still in its primary mission phase, which will end in 2010. Aura will
be  included  in  the  next  review,  to  be  held  in  2009.  The  Senior  Review  found  that
the satellites and their payloads were operating well with no life-limiting factors ex-
pected to become important through 2011. The measurements from all four missions
were found to have continuing value both for NASA science and for interagency and
national objectives.

In  general,  mission  and  instrument  lifetimes  depend  on  many  factors,  from  indi-
vidual  instrument  performance  to  spacecraft  performance.  Records  show  that  not
many  NASA  satellites  built  to  typical  mission  standards  operate  longer  than  10
years in orbit. However, these four satellites have operated in-orbit for less than 10
years, the oldest being Terra at 8 years in orbit. The primary life-limiting factor for
these  satellites  is  the  available  fuel  for  orbit  adjustment  maneuvers,  and  there  is
sufficient  fuel  for  Terra,  Aqua,  Aura,  and  SORCE  to  support  lifetimes  to  at  least
2011.
Q4. According  to  a  report  of  the  MODIS  Science  Team,’’  as  documented  in  the  The
Earth  Observer  publication,  ‘‘The  use  of  MODIS  data  for  land  studies  has  ex-
ceeded  even  our  most  optimistic  expectations  and  has  been  an  unprecedented
success  for  NASA’s  terrestrial  program.’’  Will  follow-on  sensors  to  MODIS  have
the  capability  to  support  the  growing  number  of  applications  derived  from
MODIS data?

A4. The planned follow-on sensors to MODIS are the Visible-Infrared Imager Radi-
ometer  Suite  (VIIRS)  instruments  on  the  NPOESS  platforms.  The  VIIRS  instru-
ments should have the capability to support most of the land applications pioneered
by  the  MODIS  data.  The  one  exception  to  this  is  in  the  area  of  active  fires.  VIIRS
has  some  active  fire  capability,  but  the  current  design  of  VIIRS  instrument  pre-
cludes getting active fire data of MODIS quality.
Q5. In  order  to  understand  the  science  of  global  climate  change,  it  is  necessary  to
constrain  the  uncertainty  in  changes  in  the  temperature  of  the  sun.  Unfortu-
nately,  the  historical  record  of  measurements  of  total  solar  irradiance  has  sev-
eral  unexplained  offsets  between  data  sets  from  different  satellites,  which  are
thought  to  be  due  to  inconsistent  sensor  calibration  (see,  for  example,  http://
www.ngdc.noaaa.gov/stp/SOLAR/IRRADIANCE/irrad.html).

Q5a. Does  NASA  agree  that  sensor  calibration  is  the  culprit  in  these  offsets?  If  so,
why  did  NASA  not  consistently  calibrate  sensors  on  previous  solar-monitoring
missions? If not, what does NASA identify as the cause of these offsets?

A5a. Sensor calibration is the only possible cause of these offsets; these instruments
are  monitoring  the  same  Sun  at  the  same  time,  so  should  provide  the  same  meas-
urement result. No facility has ever existed to calibrate these total solar irradiance
sensors to the desired accuracy levels, although NASA’s Glory program is currently
funding  the  establishment  of  such  a  facility.  Fortunately,  measurement  continuity
combined  with  instrument  stability  has  allowed  tracking  of  solar  variability  over
this  30-year  climate  data  record  despite  these  offsets,  the  magnitude  of  which  is
time-independent,  even  in  the  presence  of  shorter-term  variability  in  the  sun’s  out-
put.
Q5b. How  will  NASA  ensure  that  the  solar  irradiance  sensors  to  be  flown  on  Glory
and any future missions will be accurately calibrated and will stay calibrated,
so that the data they collect on total solar irradiance will be scientifically use-
ful for climate change analysis?

A5b. Despite the instrument offsets, the existing total solar irradiance (TSI) record
is already scientifically useful for climate change analysis because of data continuity
and  good  instrument  stability.  The  Glory  mission  and  future  missions  are  intended

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

80

to maintain such data continuity with on-orbit tracking of instrument stability. The
Glory  mission  and  future  missions  will  also  improve  instrument  accuracy  via  im-
proved sensor calibrations and end-to-end testing by the new TSI Radiometer Facil-
ity planned as part of the Glory program.
Q5c. What  is  the  current  technical  uncertainty  on  long-term  changes  in  total  solar
irradiation? How will Glory and other future solar-monitoring missions change
this uncertainty?

A5c. The  current  technical  uncertainty  on  long-term  changes  in  solar  radiation  is
limited by instability of some of the early instruments. These limit the current tech-
nical  uncertainty  to  about  0.004  percent  per  year  from  the  data  record  going  back
to  1978.  Since  the  early  1990s,  instruments  are  more  stable,  with  on-orbit  tracking
providing 0.001 percent per year uncertainty.

The  Glory  mission  and  other  future  solar-monitoring  missions,  as  well  as  some
currently  operating  missions  such  as  SORCE,  improve  this  uncertainty  with  better
instrument  stability.  Improved  accuracy  on  Glory  and  the  new  calibration  facility,
which will provide a baseline against which future instruments should be compared,
will  maintain  a  connection  to  the  existing  irradiance  record  across  potential  data
gaps. Improved absolute accuracy with Glory will also better allow detection of solar
changes over an extended time period by establishing current-day benchmark irradi-
ance measurements.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. What  specifically  will  NASA  do  to  maintain  the  Total  Solar  Irradiance  Sensor
(TSIS)  instrument  team  for  the  remainder  of  Fiscal  Year  2007  and  through
2008?

A1. The  TSIS  performs  two  basic  measurements:  total  solar  irradiance  using  the
Total  Irradiance  Monitor  (TIM)  and  solar  spectral  irradiance  using  the  Spectral  Ir-
radiance  Monitor  (SIM).  These  measurements  are  fundamental  to  discriminating
and  quantifying  natural  versus  anthropogenic  contributions  to  climate  change.  In
January 2007, NASA and NOAA delivered a joint report to the Office of Science and
Technology  Policy  (OSTP)  addressing  the  impacts  of  the  NPOESS  Nunn-McCurdy
Certification on climate measurement goals. In this report, NASA and NOAA deter-
mined  that  continuing  the  TSIS  measurements  had  the  highest  priority.  The  TSIS
instrument  is  built  by  the  Laboratory  for  Atmospheric  and  Space  Physics  (LASP)
of the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.

Continuous measurement of the total solar irradiance dates back to the Earth Ra-
diation  Budget  instrument  launched  on  the  NASA  Nimbus-7  mission  in  1978  and
the measurement of the solar spectral irradiance dates back to the SIM instrument
on  the  NASA  Solar  Radiation  and  Climate  Experiment  (SORCE)  mission  launched
in 2003. The SORCE mission presently provides both measurements. The measure-
ment of the total solar irradiance will be continued by the TIM on the NASA Glory
mission to be launched late in 2008.

NASA  presently  supports  the  TSIS  instrument  team  through  the  SORCE  and

Glory missions. These funds are as follows in millions of real-year dollars.

Following  the  NPOESS  Nunn-McCurdy  Certification  decision  in  June  2006  that
de-manifested  the  TSIS  instrument,  NASA  and  NOAA  have  worked  together  to
identify  various  options  for  retaining  total  and  spectrally  resolved  solar  irradiance
and  other  important  measurement  capabilities  de-manifested  from  NPOESS.  Op-
tions  are  presently  under  consideration  by  NASA  and  NOAA,  through  a  process
being led by the OSTP.
Q2. Your testimony notes that NASA’s response to Sections 313 and 314 of the NASA
Authorization  Act  of  2005  has  been  to  incorporate  the  requirements  of  the  Act
into  NASA’s  recent  research  grant  solicitation.  Could  you  please  describe  how

NASA’s  applications  grants  program,  which  focuses  on  projects  that  are  ‘‘na-
tional in scope,’’ responds to the intent of the Act?

A2. NASA’s  applications  grants  program,  known  as  the  Earth  Science  Division  Ap-
plied  Sciences  Program,  recognizes  that  environmental  decision-making,  resource
management,  and  disaster  response  most  often  resides  at  the  regional,  State,  local
and  tribal  agency  levels—it  is  imperative  that  the  program  work  at  these  levels  if
it  is  to  have  impact.  The  need  to  work  at  all  levels  of  government—and  across  a
broad range of application areas—presents a challenge to the Applied Sciences Pro-
gram,  which  is  a  small  program  that  is  managed  out  of  NASA  Headquarters  in
Washington,  DC.  NASA  is  addressing  this  challenge  in  a  number  of  ways  outlined
below.

First, in order to maximize NASA’s impact (and in keeping with our federal role),
the  Agency  supports  projects  that  are  national  in  scope;  that  is  to  say,  projects  are
required to be applicable beyond a one-time application in a single locality. By doing
this, NASA is serving a state or locale through the development and demonstration
of  an  Agency  capability  and  at  the  same  time,  NASA  is  laying  the  groundwork  for
making  that  capability  available  at  a  national  level.  In  addition,  NASA  has  many
projects that only involve federal partners, but will have an impact in all 50 states.
For example, NASA is working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  to  improve  weather
prediction for airplane travel.

Second, since NASA does not have direct connections to decision-makers and oper-
ational  agencies  at  the  State,  local,  and  tribal  levels,  the  Agency  uses  all  available
avenues  to  reach  them.  Many  of  our  federal  partners,  such  as  Environmental  Pro-
tection  Agency  (EPA),  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  and  the  Department  of  the
Interior  (DOI),  provide  direct  access  to  their  regional  and  state  branches,  who  are
directly  involved  in  decision-making  at  those  levels.  In  addition,  we  utilize  both
NASA  centers  and  universities  through  our  competitive  solicitations  to  make  con-
nections  in  their  localities.  NASA  also  makes  linkages  through  regional  govern-
mental  organizations,  such  as  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  Alliance  and  the  Western  Gov-
ernors  Association—these  provide  an  excellent  mechanism  for  reaching  potential
end-users and for understanding the needs of a region.

Finally, NASA participates in national organizations of State government officials,
such  as  National  States  Geographic  Information  Council  (NSGIC),  to  facilitate
matching their needs and federal capabilities.
Q2a. How  many  remote  sensing  pilot  projects  that  specifically  address  State,  local,

regional, and tribal agency needs has NASA’s grants program supported?

A2a. The  NASA  Earth  Science  Division  Applied  Sciences  Program  currently  spon-
sors 83 competitively selected projects that are in various stages of maturity, nearly
all  of  which  extend  NASA  research  capabilities  to  help  decision-makers  serve  citi-
zens  at  the  local,  State  and  regional  levels.  Of  these  83  active  solicited  projects,  27
are working directly with local/State authorities in 25 different states to solve their
problems. This number is expected to increase with the projects that will be selected
under  the  ‘‘Decisions  2007  under  ROSES’’  open  solicitation.  A  copy  of  this  solicita-
tion can be found at: (http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/
77336/A.20%20Decision%20Support.pdf).

Specific  language  from  Section  313  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.
109–155)  was  used  in  the  ROSES  solicitation  to  guide  the  investigators,  partners,
and peer reviewers on the priorities of the program.
Q2b. Have any workshops presenting the results of pilot projects been held?
A2b. All  of  Earth  Science  Division  Applied  Sciences  Program’s  competitively  se-
lected  projects  are  required  by  contract  to  formally  report  their  results  at  the  com-
pletion of their period of performance. In addition, dissemination of both results and
lessons learned through workshops, professional meetings, and other venues is very
important  for  the  success  of  our  projects  and  our  program.  NASA  has  found  that
a  practical  and  effective  way  to  disseminate  information  on  results  and  lessons
learned is through topical workshops that are organized by the Applied Science Pro-
gram  and  where  all  of  the  appropriate  Applied  Science  projects  meet  with  stake-
holders and potential partners to both assess their needs and to disseminate project
results  and  lessons  learned.  This  past  year  we  have  conducted  workshops  on  appli-
cations topics including Air Quality, Fisheries, Public Health, Disaster Management,
and Ecosystems Management.

NASA  requires  that  all  Applied  Science  Program  projects  plan  to  participate  in
workshops for this purpose. For example, NASA included the following language in
the  2007  Solicitation,  ‘‘Decision  Support  through  Earth  Science  Research  Results’’:

Workshop
The project should plan to travel and participate in a Program-sponsored results
conference  to  disseminate  the  lessons  learned  from  the  project  as  widely  as  fea-
sible.  The  Applied  Sciences  Program  will  coordinate  this  activity  with  project
team during the course of the project; however, the project should budget accord-
ingly to attend this event.

In  addition  to  conducting  workshops  at  the  project  and  program  levels,  Applied
Sciences  program  managers  and  grantees  attend  regional,  State,  and  professional
society  workshops  and  participate  in  interagency  working  groups  such  as  the  Gulf
of  Mexico  Alliance,  Commercial  Remote  Sensing  Space  Policy  Senior  Management
Oversight Committee, and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction.
Q2c. Has the specific advisory group called out in Sec. 314 been established? If not,

why not?

A2c. NASA is investigating establishment of an Advisory Group that will report up
through  the  NASA  Earth  Science  Advisory  Committee,  which  is  part  of  the  formal
NASA Advisory Committee (NAC). NASA expects that the Applied Sciences advisory
group, pursuant to Section 314, will be established by the end of this calendar year.
In the meantime, NASA has been seeking external advice on the program through
National  Academies  of  Science  (NAS)  Space  Studies  Board.  A  review,  entitled  ‘‘Re-
view  of  NASA’s  Earth  Science  Enterprise  Applications  Program  Plan  (2002),’’  was
completed in 2002. This was followed by a second review, entitled ‘‘Extending Obser-
vations  and  Research  Results  to  Practical  Applications:  A  Review  of  NASA’s  Ap-
proach, which has been underway since the fall of 2005.’’ The NAS has indicted that
this report will be published before the end of September 2007.
Q3. Your  testimony  notes  that  NASA  will  ‘‘preserve  and  expand  the  preeminent  re-
search  and  analysis,  applied  sciences,  technology  development  and  educational
programs that distinguish the NASA Earth Science endeavor.’’ In specific terms,
how  do  you  plan  to  expand  the  programs,  given  your  five-year  budget  profile,
and when?

A3. The  recently  released  draft  of  the  National  Research  Council’s  Decadal  Survey
for Earth Science will become the basic guide to future activities as described in the
NASA testimony. NASA intends to follow the recommendations of the Decadal Sur-
vey to the extent that the available budget will permit. In this process, the Agency’s
primary  objective  is  to  implement  the  most  useful  science  that  we  can  accomplish
within  the  framework  of  our  existing  programs.  Expansion  will  be  pursued  only
where  it  is  driven  by  the  highest  quality  science  and  consistent  with  the  available
budget.
Q4. You  testified,  ‘‘the  Earth  Science  Subcommittee  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council
annually examines the split of activities and assesses our scientific performance.’’
When was the last Earth Science Subcommittee assessment of the Earth Science
Division’s  performance  and  could  you,  please  provide  a  copy  of  that  assessment
for the record?

A4. The NASA Administrator established the Earth Science Subcommittee in early
2006 with the following terms of reference: ‘‘The Earth Science Subcommittee (ESS)
is  a  standing  subcommittee  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  (NAC);  it  also  supports
the advisory needs of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD). The scope of the Sub-
committee  includes  the  advancement  of  scientific  knowledge  of  the  Earth  system
through  space-based  observation  and  the  pioneering  use  of  these  observations  in-
cluding  process  studies,  data  assimilation  and  modeling  to  ultimately  enable  im-
proved  prediction  of  climate  variability  and  change,  weather  and  natural  hazards.
In  addition  to  scientific  research,  the  scope  encompasses  the  development  of  ena-
bling  technologies,  systems,  computing  and  information  management  capabilities,
including those with the potential to improve future operational systems.’’

The  ESS  has  met  five  times  since  its  establishment.  The  times  and  main  topics
on  the  ESS  discussion  are  summarized  below.  The  agenda  and  reports  to  the  NAC
from  the  June  2007  are  provided  for  the  record.  Records  of  previous  subcommittee
meetings,  including  summaries  of  findings  and  minutes,  are  publicly  available  at:
http://science.hq.nasa.gov/strategy/NAC¥sci¥subcom/index.html.

1. May  3–4,  2006—ESS  discussion  and  recommendation  on  allocation  of  re-
sources within ESD and assessment of balance. Also, ESS discussion on ESD
roadmapping.

2. July 6–7, 2006—ESS review of SMD draft Science Plan.

3. September  27–28,  2006—ESS  review  of  ESD  Science  Plan;  review  of

NPOESS restructuring efforts.

4. February 27–28, 2007—ESS review of ESD Decadal Survey early assessment
and  ESD  preparatory  mission  concept  studies;  lunar  science  workshop  par-
ticipation.

5. June  12–13,  2007—ESS  review  of  ESD  planning  for  Community  workshops
relating to the earliest group of the Decadal Survey missions; review and as-
sessment of selected Annual Performance Goals (APG).

Regarding the APG review, the ESS was asked to support the NASA-wide process
of developing the FY 2007 Performance and Accountability Report to Congress. The
ESS  reviewed  ESD  material  relevant  to  six  APGs,  one  of  each  science  focus  areas.
The material reviewed constitutes peer-reviewed results of ESD funded research ac-
tivities.  The  considered  APGs  are  pertinent  to  the  Research  and  Analysis  Program.
[See Attachment A, Earth Science Subcommittee Report.]
Q5. What was the original objective of the Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP)

program, and how, if at all, has the objective for the program changed?

A5. The ESSP program, within the NASA Earth Explorers Program, was originally
intended to provide frequent, flexible opportunities for rapid-development flight mis-
sions focused on specific Earth science investigations. ESSP missions were to be fo-
cused on:

• Acquiring  key  additional  measurements  in  response  to  new  scientific  under-
standing,  including  exploiting  scientific  discoveries  from  facility-class  mis-
sions;

• Proving  the  concept  and  scientific  utility  of  new  data  sets  and  measurement

approaches; and/or,

• Ensuring  the  continuity  of  critical  measurement  time  series  (i.e.,  ‘‘gap  filler’’

missions for critical data sets).

The ESSP program was intended to:

• Provide frequent, predictable opportunities for training new investigators and
ensuring  the  continued  broad  involvement  of  the  scientific  community  in  the
overall development of ESE satellite projects;

• Encourage direct involvement of university faculty and students in all aspects
of  ESE  flight  mission  planning  and  implementation,  and  expand  the  base  of
academic  institutions  that  have  the  capability  (through  experienced  faculty)
to manage satellite-related technical projects; and,

• Foster  development  of  innovative  teaming  arrangements  that  optimize  the
contributions and minimize the costs of industry, university, and government
partners. (from the NRC PI-led mission report, ‘‘Steps to Facilitate Principal-
Investigator-Led  Earth  Science  Missions’’  of  which  Dr.  Michael  Freilich  was
an author)

ESSP  missions  are  characterized  by:  Competitive  selection;  overall  mission  life
cycle  cost  constraints  (generally  small-to-medium  missions  only);  PI-led,  focused
science objectives defined and managed by the Principal Investigator; and, relatively
rapid  development  (although  this  has  not  been  achieved).  The  overall  goals  of  the
ESSP program have not fundamentally changed.
Q5a. When  was  the  last  solicitation  for  an  ESSP  mission  issued,  and  what  are  the

plans for the frequency of future solicitations?

A5a. The last NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for ESSP missions was the
ESSP–3 AO, released in 2001 (earlier solicitations were released in 1996 and 1998).
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (in development to be launched in late 2008) and
Aquarius  (in  development  to  be  launched  in  mid-2010  in  collaboration  with  the
SAC–D mission of the Argentine Space Agency CONAE) missions were chosen from
the  ESSP–3  AO  solicitation,  with  Hydros  selected  for  initial  development  as  a
backup  should  one  of  the  two  primary  missions  not  be  developed  successfully.  The
President’s FY 2008 budget request includes funding for a new ESSP mission to be
solicited in late 2008, with launch no earlier than 2014.
Q5b. The decadal survey recommends that ESSP missions be replaced with low-cost
research and applications missions that ‘‘focus on fostering revolutionary inno-
vation  and  training  future  leaders  of  space-based  Earth  science  and  applica-
tions.’’ What is NASA’s response to this recommendation?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

A5b. The recommendation to establish a ‘‘Venture Class’’ program to solicit competi-
tive,  ultra-low-cost  (∼$100  to  $200  million)  missions  or  instrument  flight  opportuni-
ties  annually  or  bi-annually  will  be  considered  along  with  the  other  recommenda-
tions of the Decadal Survey for Earth Science as part of the NASA FY 2009 budget
formulation  process.  NASA  will  be  guided  by  the  community  consensus,  high-pri-
ority science issues identified by the Decadal Survey, and will design the most effi-
cient  program  possible  to  advance  the  identified  science  issues  and  maintain  the
balanced, broad program called for by the Survey.
Q6. Your testimony indicates that NASA is ‘‘planning a comprehensive review of the
[applied sciences] program to ensure that is aligned with the NAS Decadal sur-
vey  recommendations.’’  What  will  that  review  entail,  who  will  conduct  it,  and
what is the schedule?

A6. The Applied Sciences Program’s new leadership is currently conducting a multi-
step  review  of  the  entire  program,  including  program  structure  and  management,
in  light  of  the  recommendations  made  in  the  Decadal  Survey  with  respect  to  appli-
cations,  as  well  as  the  upcoming  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report  that  specifi-
cally  addresses  NASA’s  approach  to  applications  (see  the  answer  to  Question  2c).
First,  an  informal  review  is  taking  place  through  program  reviews  at  NASA  Head-
quarters, visits to the NASA field centers (reviews have taken place so far at Ames
Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Stennis Space Center, and Langley
Research Center), and through presentations of individual projects by investigators.
Second,  formal  peer  reviews  of  selected  projects  will  take  place  this  fall.  Third,  a
formal programmatic review will take place upon formation of the new Applications
Advisory  Group  in  early  calendar  2008  (also  discussed  in  Question  2c).  This  formal
review will include both the current program and proposed future strategic direction
that the program is considering.
Q7. When  will  NASA  deliver  the  NASA–NOAA  Research  to  Operations  Joint  Work-
ing  Group  report,  as  directed  in  Section  306  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act,  to
Congress?

A7. The  report  required  pursuant  to  Section  306  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of
2005 (P.L. 109–155) was delivered to the relevant Committees on July 10, 2007.
Q8. You testified that NASA is ‘‘letting four contracts for LDCM and they are in the
process of being advertised right now and the interaction between them and the
technical addition of TSIS will govern our schedule and our decisions.’’

Q8a. Does  the  original  accommodation  study  awards  issued  to  the  four  contractors
require  them  to  address  the  potential  accommodation  of  TSIS  and  any  other
sensors (other than OLI)? If not, was a change to the contract made to address
those issues?

A8a. The  original  accommodation  study  awards  issued  to  the  four  spacecraft  con-
tractors  within  the  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  (LDCM)  project  include  op-
tions to study interfacing other sensors, in addition to the Operational Land Imager
(OLI),  to  the  LDCM  observatory.  These  study  options  have  been  initiated  and  all
four spacecraft contractors are in the process of analyzing the manifest of the TSIS
on the LDCM.
Q9. What are the technical differences between the requirements issued for the Oper-
ational Land Imager (OLI) instrument for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission
(LDCM) and the capabilities of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper on the Landsat
7 spacecraft?

A9. The  differences  between  capabilities  of  the  Enhanced  Thematic  Mapper  (ETM)
on the Landsat 7 and the requirements for the LDCM–OLI include the following en-
hancements for OLI: an additional band for coastal zone science; an additional band
for  cloud  detection;  and,  an  enhancement  to  a  band  to  make  images  clearer.  Ther-
mal imaging capability is not part of the OLI baseline capability. Thermal capability
has  been  investigated  as  an  optional  separate  instrument  that  would  operate  con-
currently with the OLI. Following extensive analysis and assessment of alternatives
for  thermal  image  data  capability,  NASA  has  determined  that  the  current  budget
profile cannot support the acquisition of the thermal capability for LDCM.
Q9a. Did  the  RFP  for  the  OLI  include  the  option  of  including  thermal  imaging

bands?

A9a. No. The thermal capability was scoped as a separate optional instrument.
Q9b. Is  NASA  analyzing  alternatives  to  LDCM  for  acquiring  thermal  imaging  data
such as instrument flight on other platforms, data purchases, or access to data

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

85

obtained  from  any  international  satellites  that  could  provide  comparable  ther-
mal imaging data?

A9b. The  required  performance  for  the  Landsat  thermal  data  is  not  immediately
available  in  proven  form  from  any  current  source.  NASA  is  assessing  international
collaboration to potentially provide the thermal capability.
Q10. What  plans  does  NASA  have  to  ensure  that  scientists  would  have  information
on  instrumentation  details,  engineering  data,  and  the  like  to  ensure  that  data
provided from international instruments are of research quality?

A10. NASA  has  supported  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  in  the  definition  of
a range of Landsat performance specifications that define LDCM performance (spec-
tral  bands,  radiometry,  spatial  resolution,  geographic  registration,  and  geographic
coverage)  and  a  lower  end  baseline  specification.  Data  meeting  the  Baseline  Speci-
fication  would  replace  (in  quantity  and  quality)  only  a  portion  of  the  Landsat  data
stream  should  Landsat  fail,  but  such  data  may  also  be  useful  as  an  ongoing  aug-
mentation  of  the  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  (LDCM),  currently  projected  to
launch sometime in 2011. Acquired data must be characterized and verified against
these specifications to ensure data quality and continuity. NASA will support USGS
to ensure that acquired data is characterized and verified.

NASA  has  a  rich  history  of  working  with  international  partners  on  joint  mission
development,  and  on  instrument  data  exchange  and  availability  for  U.S.  scientists’
research  and  educational  use.  NASA  makes  such  data  products  supplied  from  an
international  partner  available  under  terms  and  conditions  required  by  the  appro-
priate  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU).  Where  data  are  available  through
NASA  data  systems,  instrumentation  details,  engineering  data,  and  documentation
on  data  accuracy  are  also  available  and  supplied  with  the  data.  NASA  works
through  the  Committee  on  Earth  Observation  Satellites  (CEOS)  to  promote  more
generally agreement and implementation of standards both for instrument data doc-
umentation  availability,  and  for  instrument  calibration  and  validation  procedures.
CEOS  membership  encompasses  the  world’s  government  agencies  responsible  for
civil  Earth  Observation  (EO)  satellite  programs,  along  with  agencies  that  receive
and process data acquired remotely from space. Within CEOS working groups, inter-
national  projects  are  voluntarily  undertaken  for  coordination  of  resources  for  data
availability,  and  for  inter-calibration  of  like  instruments  using  in  situ  instrumenta-
tion by the appropriate space agencies.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. In his statement, Dr. Anthes asserted that ‘‘we are faced with an Earth observa-
tion  program  that  will  dramatically  diminish  in  capability  over  the  next  10–15
years. . . Between now and the end of the decade, the number of operating mis-
sions  will  decrease  dramatically,  and  the  number  of  operating  sensors  and  in-
struments  on  NASA  spacecraft. . .will  decrease  by  some  35  percent,  with  a  50
percent reduction by 2015.’’ Do you agree with this assessment?

A1. NASA is presently operating an impressive set of 14 Earth-observing spacecraft
carrying  over  50  instruments.  In  addition,  the  President’s  FY  2008  budget  request
includes  funding  for  an  additional  seven  identified  Earth  observing  missions  to
launch  between  2008  and  2014,  and  funding  for  a  small  to  medium  Earth  System
Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  mission,  which  will  be  solicited  for  competitive  selection
late  in  FY  2008  with  flight  in  the  2014–2015  timeframe.  The  National  Research
Council (NRC) Earth Science Decadal Survey identifies 15 new missions to address
key Earth system science research issues over the next 10 to 15 years.

While 11 of NASA’s 14 currently operating missions are indeed beyond their base-
line  lifetime,  they  continue  to  operate  well  and  to  provide  high  quality  measure-
ments for the research and operational communities. From February to April 2007,
NASA’s  Earth  Science  Division  conducted  the  biennial  ‘‘Senior  Review’’  to  examine
Earth  observing  missions  operating  beyond  their  baseline  mission.  After  careful
technical analysis, both the operations and science panels in the Senior Review con-
cluded that all 11 of the operating missions were returning valuable data and were
not suffering from imminent mission-threatening technical problems. Consequently,
the Senior Review recommended that NASA continue to fund operations and science
analyses for all of these missions for at least two more years.

The President’s FY 2008 budget request contains funding for the development and

launch of seven new Earth observing missions between 2008 and 2014:

surface salinity;

• OSTM  (Ocean  Surface  Topography  Mission;  June  2008  launch)  to  continue
the  time  series  of  precision  global  ocean  sea  level  measurements  initiated  by
TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992 and presently obtained by JASON–1;
• OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory; December 2008 launch) to initiate global
measurements  of  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  and  to  identify,  for  the  first
time, regional (1000 km spatial scale) sources and sinks of CO2;
• Glory  (December  2008  to  March  2009  launch)  to  continue  the  26-year  con-
sistent  time  series  of  solar  irradiance  measurements  and  to  initiate  global
measurements of atmospheric aerosol concentration and scattering properties;
• Aquarius (July 2009 launch) to make first-ever, global measurements of ocean
• NPP (NPOESS Preparatory Program; September 2009 launch) to continue the
time  series  of  key  EOS  sensor  measurements,  and  to  provide  risk-reduction
for the tri-agency NPOESS operational satellite system;
• LDCM  (Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission;  July  2011  launch)  to  continue  the
• GPM  (Global  Precipitation  Measurement  Mission;  June  2013  and  June  2014
launches)  to  extend  to  the  entire  globe  the  present  measurements  of  tropical
precipitation from the presently operating Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission
(TRMM),  allowing  accurate,  global  rainfall  measurements  every  three  hours.
In  addition  to  these  seven  missions  comprising  eight  launches  between  2008  and
2014,  the  FY  2008  budget  request  also  includes  funding  for  a  small  to  medium
Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  mission,  which  will  be  solicited  for  com-
petitive selection late in FY 2008 with flight in the 2014–2015 timeframe.

30-year long record of moderate-resolution land imaging; and,

The  NRC  Earth  Science  Decadal  Survey,  which  was  released  just  three  weeks
prior  to  the  FY  2008  budget  submission,  identifies  15  additional  Earth  observing
missions for NASA in the 2010–2022 timeframe.
Q2. What are your views regarding the mission cost estimates included in the Earth

Sciences Decadal Survey? Are they credible?

A2. NASA’s  Earth  Science  Division  conducted  detailed  Center-based  technical  and
cost  ‘‘concept  studies’’  for  each  of  the  missions  identified  for  NASA  in  the  Decadal
Survey.  These  studies  identified  technical  challenges  and  developed  cost  estimates
which  include  realistic  launch  service  costs  and  the  mission  operations  and  science
analysis costs associated with each mission. The results of each of these studies are
being confirmed with independent cost estimates.

In  cases  where  mission  designs  are  well  established,  technological  risks  are  low,
and  significant  previous  NASA  investment  has  been  made  to  understand  the  mis-
sions,  mission  cost  estimates  in  the  Decadal  Survey  are  relatively  close  to  the  cost
estimates of ongoing NASA mission concept studies. In other cases, the preliminary
studies  suggest  substantial  differences  between  the  detailed  NASA  studies  and  the
estimates developed by the NRC.
Q3. The Decadal Survey highlighted the importance of developing a strategy to tran-
sition  technologies  from  NASA  to  operational  systems.  How  is  transition  man-
aged today? What steps can NASA take to improve technology transition between
researchers and the applications community?

A3. Transition  of  satellite  measurement  capability  from  research  to  operations  has
been,  and  remains,  challenging.  NASA  developed  and  demonstrated  several  of  the
instruments  and  measurement  concepts  that  form  the  foundation  for  the  present
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  and  Department  of  De-
fense (DOD) operational weather satellite systems, such as the Advanced Very High
Resolution  Radiometer  (AVHRR)  and  the  Special  Sensor  Microwave  Imager  (SSM/
I)  multi-channel  microwave  radiometer  flown  on  the  DOD  Defense  Meteorological
Satellite  Program.  Joint  work  between  NASA  and  NOAA  has  resulted  in  processes
that  allow  near-real-time  measurements  from  the  research  missions  to  be  merged
with  data  from  NOAA  operational  satellites  that  result  in  enhanced  operational
weather predictions (e.g., QuikSCAT; TRMM; AIRS; MODIS fire products; JASON–
1). Other instruments that have transitioned from research to operations include the
Solar  X–Ray  Imager  which  currently  flies  on  NOAA  Geostationary  Operational  En-
vironmental Satellites. Work is ongoing to transition an on-orbit lightning capability
onto NOAA’s next generation GOES–R series.

Following  recommendations  from  National  Research  Council  reports  (e.g.,  the
2003  report  of  the  Committee  on  NASA–NOAA  Transition  from  Research  to  Oper-
ations)  and  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155),  a  NASA–NOAA
Joint  Working  group  has  been  re-established  and  has  addressed  a  wide  range  of

issues associated with research-to-operations transitions. NOAA and NASA are also
discussing approaches to initiating joint NASA–NOAA program(s) focused on devel-
oping  new  instruments  for  operational  services.  Other  focused  groups  such  as  the
NOAA–NASA–DOD  Altimeter  Working  Group  meet  bimonthly  to  coordinate  re-
search,  civil,  and  defense  operational  measurement  systems  to  acquire  global  sea-
level height and wave condition measurements.

The NASA Applied Science Program is focused specifically on working with appli-
cations mission agencies (such as the Federal Aviation Administration, Department
of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, etc.). In this way, the Ap-
plied  Science  Program  efficiently  transitions  the  knowledge  gained  through  NASA
Earth science missions and the research and analysis program, into information di-
rectly useful to other mission agencies with national or super-regional scope.
Q4. To what degree are the governments of large developing countries, such as China
and India, taking an interest in climate change research and attempting to miti-
gate  further  damage  to  the  environment?  Do  they  acknowledge  that  climate
change  may  be,  in  part,  a  consequence  of  human  activity?  Has  a  credible  esti-
mate  been  developed  on  the  amounts  of  some  pollutants  ’  released  into  the  at-
mosphere by these countries?

A4. Perhaps the best indicator of the interest taken by the governments of large de-
veloping  countries,  such  as  China,  India,  and  Brazil,  in  the  issue  of  climate  change
and  associated  research  is  the  very  active  role  they  play  in  the  Intergovernmental
Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  the  leading  international  forum  on  this  issue.
Based  on  reported  discussions  at  recent  IPCC  meetings,  it  is  clear  that  these  na-
tions  acknowledge  a  connection  between  human  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  cli-
mate  change.  However,  they  also  reportedly  seek  the  acknowledgement  from  devel-
oped nations that those nations that industrialized first shoulder a greater responsi-
bility  for  the  current  atmospheric  greenhouse  gas  levels  than  do  nations  which  in-
dustrialized  later.  These  nations  are  also  reportedly  concerned  about  the  cost  of  re-
ducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  to  developing  economies.  Another  indicator  of  the
interest  taken  by  the  Indian  government  in  this  area  is  the  bilateral  Climate
Change Partnership between the United States and Indian governments. Formed in
2002, this partnership provides a forum for both nations to engage in domestic and
international  efforts  to  address  the  issue  of  Climate  Change,  including  looking  at
new technologies and policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With re-
gard  to  assessing  the  release  of  pollutants  into  the  atmosphere,  NASA’s  Earth-ob-
serving  missions  and  NASA-funded  research  studies  are  providing  unique,  quan-
titative,  global  measurements  of  atmospheric  constituents  which  play  key  roles  in
determining  air  quality  as  well  as  influencing  climate  change.  While  many  space-
based  global  measurement  sets  have  not,  to  date,  provided  the  high-resolution  and
frequent  measurements  required  for  determining  the  compositions  and  magnitudes
of sub-regional pollution sources, advanced analyses applied to recent measurements
from the NASA Aura mission have provided first-ever quantitative data on pollutant
levels  at  regional  and  national  scales.  For  example,  sophisticated  NASA-developed
algorithms  allow  accurate  global  measurements  of  column  sulfur  dioxide  (a  key  in-
dustrial  pollutant  generated  from  smelters  and  electrical  generation  plants  and  the
source  of  ‘‘acid  rain’’)  on  scales  of  thousands  of  kilometers,  from  the  Ozone  Meas-
uring  Instrument  on  the  Aura  mission.  These  measurements  show  that  in  2005,
Chinese  factories  emitted  2.5  million  tons  of  sulfur  dioxide  into  the  atmosphere,  an
increase  of  more  than  27  percent  over  the  estimated  Chinese  emission  levels  in
2000. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory, to be launched by NASA in late 2008, will
provide  first-ever  global  measurements  of  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  sources  and
sinks  on  scales  as  small  as  1000  km  (628  miles).  NASA’s  role  is  to  advance  Earth
System  science  through  Earth  observing  research  satellite  missions,  and  vigorous
analysis and modeling efforts to elucidate key Earth system processes and the inter-
actions between them. While these measurements form the foundation for many sci-
entific and policy analyses, NASA itself does not conduct policy studies.

Dear Dr. David:

The Earth Science Subcommittee (ESS) met on June 12–13, 2007 at NASA Head-
quarters.  We  received  updates  on  ESD  (Michael  Freilich)  and  NPOESS  (Bryant
Cramer),  and  briefings  on  (1)  the  sub-orbital  program  (Andy  Roberts),  (2)  the  tech-
nology  program  (Amy  Walton),  and  (3)  the  upcoming  community  workshops  aimed
at  defining  the  first  wave  of  satellite  missions  from  the  NRC  Decadal  Survey.  We
reviewed  and  graded  the  FY  2007  Earth  Science  Performance  and  Accountability
Report,  and  discussed  the  Lunar  Science  Workshop  Report  as  well  as  the  response
of the NAC to our March 2007 recommendation for an Earth Science Initiative.

The  central  recommendation  from  our  March  2007  letter  to  the  NAC  was  for  an
Earth  Science  Initiative  to  enable  ESD  to  implement  the  program  of  missions  de-
signed  by  the  NRC  Decadal  Survey  (DS)  and  which  we  fully  endorsed.  We  pointed
out that the bleak long-term outlook for ESD funding does not allow for implemen-
tation  of  the  DS  and  recommended  that  resources  for  an  Earth  Science  Initiative
be  found,  either  within  or  outside  NASA,  in  order  to  implement  the  DS—cor-
responding  to  a  30  percent  increase  of  ESD  budgets,  i.e.,  a  return  to  2000  funding
levels. We were disappointed that the NAC decided not to forward the recommenda-
tion to the Administrator, despite the support from the NAC Science Committee, on
the  grounds  that  requesting  new  funding  was  outside  the  charter  of  the  NAC.  But
this  apparent  technicality  leaves  unsolved  the  problem  of  how  NASA  is  to  respond
to  the  DS.  At  a  time  of  great  public  concern  over  global  change,  NASA  cannot  just
bury its head in the sand.
The  DS  calls  for  14  strategic  missions  (typically  in  the  ∼$500M  range)  to  be
launched  over  the  2010–2020  period.  It  also  calls  for  a  new  class  of  Venture  mis-
sions  in  the  $100–200M  range  to  foster  the  development  of  new  ideas.  The  ESD
budget outlook going out to 2014 offers opportunities for just two strategic missions,
and has no line for Venture missions. ESS scrutinized the ESD budget and received
briefings  on  all  its  major  components.  We  do  not  see  how  the  current  budget  could
be  reconfigured  to  enable  more  effective  implementation  of  the  DS.  The  hard  truth
is  that  the  30  percent  budget  cut  that  ESD  has  suffered  since  2000  incapacitates
it  from  developing  new  initiatives.  The  DS  indicates  that  its  slate  of  14  missions
would  be  fully  doable  if  ESD  funding  were  restored  to  2000  levels.  Implementation
of the DS requires new resources from an Earth Science Initiative to start in FY09
at the latest.

We  are  concerned  that  NASA  may  feel  that  it  has  properly  responded  to  the  DS
if  it  launches  say  the  first  wave  of  four  DS  missions  over  the  next  decade.  In  fact,
the  ensemble  of  14  missions  for  the  next  decade  put  forth  by  the  DS  represents  a
carefully  crafted  synergistic  ensemble,  and  the  DS  specifically  warns  against  piece-
meal selection of missions. The DS Executive Summary states: ‘‘In the event of budg-
et shortfalls, re-evaluate the entire set of missions given an assessment of the current
state  of  international  global  Earth  observations,  plans,  needs,  and  opportunities.
Seek advice from the broad community of Earth scientists and modify the long-term
strategy rather than dealing with one mission at a time.’’ We will face this situation
in FY09 unless an Earth Science Initiative is implemented. We remain hopeful that

89

resources for such an Initiative will be found, either through the Congressional allo-
cation of FY08 or through the Administrator’s request in FY09.

We  ask  the  NAC  to  advise  the  Administrator  that  in  the  absence  of  an
Earth  Science  Initiative  in  place  by  FY09  to  implement  the  NRC  Decadal
Survey, NASA will have defaulted on its implementation of the DS and will
need to re-think its whole Earth science strategy with input from the broad
scientific community. This would represent a major failure and we remain
hopeful that positive action will be taken over the next year.

The current NPOESS debacle has further heightened the crisis for Earth observa-
tion from space. The NPOESS climate sensors TSIS, APS, OMPS–Limn, ERBS, and
ALT  were  de-manifested  as  part  of  the  recent  Nunn-McCurdy  Certification.  CMIS
was partly maintained but with reduced capability—if it loses its capability to meas-
ure  microwave  surface  temperatures  (that  was  not  clear  to  us),  then  it  will  be  of
little  use  as  a  climate  sensor.  A  positive  development  is  that  OSTP  tasked  NASA
and  NOAA  to  examine  options  for  recovering  the  ensemble  of  NPOESS  climate
measurements  through  other  means.  As  we  have  stated  in  previous  letters,  long-
term, continuous, well-calibrated measurements of key climate variables from space
are critical for monitoring climate variability and change and for testing our under-
standing  of  the  same.  ESD  shared  with  us  four  options  presently  under  consider-
ation  in  their  joint  discussions  with  NOAA.  Options  1  and  4  involve  restoration  of
the climate sensors on later NPOESS satellites, while options 2 and 3 abandon the
association  with  NPOESS  and  instead  rely  on  ‘‘climate  free-flier’’  satellites  to  carry
the  climate  sensors.  Options  2  and  3  seem  to  us  the  best  choices  cost-wise  and  to
avoid  being  hostage  to  the  NPOESS  program.  We  recommend  that  long-term
monitoring  of  climate  variables  from  space  be  conducted  from  ‘‘climate
free-fliers’’ (options 2 and 3 of the NASA/NOAA White Paper) for reasons of
both reliability and cost.

ESD  will  hold  community  workshops  over  the  next  month  to  better  define  each
of the four notional missions representing the first wave (2010–2015) of DS missions
(CLARREO,  SMAP,  ICESat-II,  DESDynI).  The  workshop  chairs  briefed  us  on  their
plans. We were impressed by their dedication and by the dynamic that these work-
shops  represent  for  implementing  the  DS.  We  have  two  major  comments  for  their
consideration.

(1)  The  CLARREO  presentation  implied  that  CLARREO  should  be  considered  as
a  sustained  measurement,  but  this  would  have  cost  implications  beyond  those  esti-
mated  by  the  DS. An important decision to be made at the CLARREO work-
shop is whether or not the mission entails a long-term commitment to spec-
trally resolved thermal IR measurements, as this will greatly affect the cost
of  the  mission.  If  long-term  commitment  is  required,  there  should  be  a
strategy for transition from research to operations that will enable projec-
tion of the long-term impacts on ESD budgets.

(2) Consideration should be given to different configurations of the DESDynI and
ICESat-II sensors. The DS combined the surface deformation InSAR and vegetation
structure  laser  altimeter  into  one  notional  mission  (DESDynI),  but  called  also  for
further  analysis  of  whether  this  combination  was  viable  and  whether  a  better  com-
bination  might  be  achieved  with  the  ICESat-II  laser  altimeter.  There  will  be  dif-
ferences in the optimal orbits for each of these instruments, but is it possible to set-
tle for a less-than-optimal orbit in order to enable joint launch at considerably lower
cost? These issues should be addressed at the DESDynI and ICE–Sat-II workshops.
We recommend that ESD keep an open perspective on the opportunities for
different  configurations  of  the  L-band  InSAR,  the  vegetation  laser  altim-
eter, and the ice surface altimeter onto common satellite platforms for pur-
poses  of  cost  reductions.  We  encourage  cross-participation  in  the  ICESat-
II and DESDynI community workshops.

We  reviewed  the  outcomes  of  the  February  Lunar  Science  Workshop  and  in  par-
ticular  the  recommendations  for  Earth  Science.  We  were  pleased  to  see  a  strong
statement in the workshop report that recommendations for missions enabled by the
lunar  architecture  must  be  vetted  through  a  NRC  Decadal  Survey  or  similar  proc-
ess. We were pleased to see a strong affirmation of the value of Earth science obser-
vations  from  the  Moon.  As  noted  in  the  report,  the  current  proposed  site  for  the
polar  base  is  an  issue  because  of  its  limited  view  of  the  Earth,  and  an  outpost  at
Mt.  Malapert  with  much  better  Earth  viewing  capability  would  address  this  issue.
We wish to emphasize that satellites at the Earth-Moon L1 point supporting
lunar  operations  would  also  represent  ideal  platforms  for  observing  the
Earth.

We received a briefing on the ESD sub-orbital program from manager Andy Rob-
erts. We had expressed concern in the past that this important program was lacking
direction.  We  were  pleased  to  see  a  strong  articulation  of  the  main  purposes  of  the

sub-orbital  program  within  ESD:  (1)  satellite  cal/val  including  science-directed,  (2)
new  sensor  development,  (3)  process  studies.  We  were  pleased  to  see  the  value  of
the  UAS  (Unmanned  Airborne  Systems)  expressed  in  terms  of  their  scientific  pur-
pose  (endurance,  extended  low-altitude  flight)  instead  of  abstract  and  likely
unaffordable technological goals. We were impressed by the educational vision of the
sub-orbital program, recognizing aircraft missions as a unique means to provide stu-
dents with hands-on experience and train future leaders. We remain concerned that
the core aircraft (both manned and UAS) are under-utilized and that this represents
a  substantial  cost  burden  to  the  program.  Hopes  from  cost-sharing  by  non-NASA
customers have not materialized. We recommend that the sub-orbital program
take a hard look at its needs for core aircraft to determine whether signifi-
cant  cost  savings  could  be  achieved  at  minimal  loss  for  science  by  decom-
missioning one of the aircraft.

We were impressed by the briefing on the ESD technology program from manager
Amy Walton. The program has a clear focus and balance, including in particular the
development  of  cross-cutting  and  targeted  technologies  aimed  at  implementing  the
DS. A concern expressed by Walton was how to support the development of targeted
technologies  (directed  at  one  specific  mission)  without  creating  a  non-competitive
pipeline for subsequent selection of the mission. We recommend that at least two
competing  approaches  or  groups  be  supported  in  the  development  of  any
targeted  technology  in  order  to  maintain  competition  at  the  subsequent
level of mission selection.

We  were  asked  to  review  and  grade  the  ESD  FY07  Performance  and  Account-
ability Report, but we were not satisfied by the process under which we were asked
to  carry  out  the  review.  The  performance  report  submitted  to  us  was  very  uneven
across  areas.  We  would,  for  example,  have  liked  to  see  for  each  area  i)  the  number
of scientists actively carrying out research, ii) a list of publications, iii) perhaps ab-
stracts  of  selected  publications,  and  iv)  some  synthesis  paragraphs  that  provide  an
overview  of  activities,  accomplishments,  and  hindrances.  We  were  not  clearly  told
what readership was targeted by the report. Our own charge was not clear—simply
rate  each  outcome  as  green,  yellow  or  red?  Provide  critical  comments  on  the  sup-
porting text? We ask that the procedure for reviewing the ESD Performance
Evaluation and Accountability Report be improved next year, and that the
material submitted to ESS for review be more informative.

We  include  as  Appendices  for  specific  action  by  the  NAC  our  recommendations
that (1) the Administrator be advised that NASA will default on its response to the
DS  and  have  to  rethink  its  Earth  Science  Program  if  funding  for  an  Earth  Science
Initiative  does  not  materialize  by  FY  2007;  (2)  climate  free-flyer  satellites  be  used
in lieu of NPOESS for long-term monitoring of key climate variables, (3) the Earth-
Moon L1 point be recognized as the optimum platform for observing the Earth from
the  Moon  as  part  of  the  Lunar  Exploration  Architecture.  Our  other  recommenda-
tions may be best considered at the level of the ESD leadership.

Sincerely,
The Earth Science Subcommittee

Proposed Recommendation for the NAC Science Committee

Subcommittee Name: Earth Science
Chair: Daniel J. Jacob
Date of Public Deliberation: June 12–13, 2007
Date of Transmission: June 28, 2007
Short Title of Proposed Recommendation: Action on NASA Earth Science Initia-
tive Needed by FY09
Short Description of Proposed Recommendation:

We  ask  the  NAC  to  advise  the  Administrator  that  in  the  absence  of  an  Earth
Science  Initiative  in  place  by  FY09  to  implement  the  NRC  Decadal  Survey,  NASA
will  have  defaulted  on  its  implementation  of  the  DS  and  will  need  to  re-think  its
whole  Earth  science  strategy  with  input  from  the  broad  scientific  community.  This
would  represent  a  major  failure  and  we  remain  hopeful  that  positive  action  will  be
taken over the next year.
Outline of the Major Reasons for Proposing the Recommendation:

The  central  recommendation  from  our  March  2007  letter  to  the  NAC  was  for  an
Earth  Science  Initiative  to  enable  ESD  to  implement  the  program  of  14  missions
for  2010–2020  designed  by  the  NRC  Decadal  Survey  (DS)  and  which  we  fully  en-
dorsed.  The  NAC  decided  not  to  forward  the  recommendation  to  the  Administrator
on  the  grounds  that  requesting  new  funding  was  outside  its  charter.  This  techni-
cality leaves unsolved the problem of how NASA is to respond to the DS. At a time
of unprecedented public concern over global change, NASA cannot just bury its head
in  the  sand.  As  explained  in  our  letter,  the  current  ESD  budget  outlook  completely
defaults on the DS. Piecemeal implementation of the DS is not an option. Implemen-
tation  of  the  DS  requires  new  resources  from  an  Earth  Science  Initiative  to  start
in FY09 at the latest. In the absence of such an Initiative, NASA will need to totally
re-think its long-term strategy for Earth Science.
Outline of the Consequences of No Action on the Proposed Recommendation:

This  is  best  stated  by  the  DS  Executive  Summary:  ‘‘In  the  event  of  budget  short-
falls,  re-evaluate  the  entire  set  of  missions  given  an  assessment  of  the  current  state
of international global Earth observations, plans, needs, and opportunities. Seek ad-
vice from the broad community of Earth scientists and modify the long-term strategy
rather than dealing with one mission at a time.’’

Proposed Recommendation for the NAC Science Committee

Subcommittee Name: Earth Science
Chair: Daniel J. Jacob
Date of Public Deliberation: June 12–13, 2007
Date of Transmission: June 28, 2007
Short Title of Proposed Recommendation: Free Flier Satellites for Climate Moni-
toring
Short Description of Proposed Recommendation:

We recommend that long-term monitoring of climate variables from space be con-
ducted  from  ‘‘climate  free-flier’’  satellites  (options  2  and  3  of  the  NASA/NOAA
NPOESS White Paper), rather than through the NPOESS suite, for reasons of both
reliability and cost.
Outline of the Major Reasons for Proposing the Recommendation:

The  current  NPOESS  debacle  has  heightened  the  crisis  for  Earth  observation
from space. The NPOESS climate sensors TSIS, APS, OMPS-Limn, ERBS, and ALT
were  de-manifested  as  part  of  the  recent  Nunn-McCurdy  Certification.  CMIS  was
partly  maintained  but  with  reduced  capability.  OSTP  tasked  NASA  and  NOAA  to
examine  options  for  recovering  the  ensemble  of  NPOESS  climate  measurements
through  other  means.  ESD  shared  with  us  four  options  presently  under  consider-
ation  in  their  joint  discussions  with  NOAA.  Options  1  and  4  involve  restoration  of
the climate sensors on later NPOESS satellites, while options 2 and 3 abandon the
association  with  NPOESS  and  instead  rely  on  ‘‘climate  free-flier’’  satellites  to  carry
the  climate  sensors.  Options  2  and  3  are  the  best  choices  for  reasons  of  both  cost
and reliability.
Outline of the Consequences of No Action on the Proposed Recommendation:

As we have stated in previous letters, long-term, continuous, well-calibrated meas-
urements of key climate variables from space are critical for monitoring climate var-
iability  and  change  and  for  testing  our  understanding  of  the  same.  NPOESS  has
demonstrated  its  failure  in  commitment  to  climate  monitoring.  Long-term  climate
observations  should  not  be  held  hostage  to  NPOESS’s  other  priorities.  We  stand  at
risk of losing critical continuity in measurements of climate variables.

Proposed Recommendation for the NAC Science Committee

Subcommittee Name: Earth Science
Chair: Daniel J. Jacob
Date of Public Deliberation: June 12–13, 2007
Date of Transmission: June 28, 2007
Short  Title  of  Proposed  Recommendation:  Earth  Observation  from  the  Earth-
Moon L1 point
Short Description of Proposed Recommendation:

We  ask  the  Lunar  Exploration  Architecture  to  recognize  that  satellites  at  the
Earth-Moon  L1  point  supporting  lunar  operations  would  also  represent  excellent
platforms for observing the Earth.
Outline of the Major Reasons for Proposing the Recommendation:

The current proposed polar site for the lunar base is not adequate for Earth obser-
vation  because  of  its  limited  view  of  the  Earth.  An  outpost  at  Mt.  Malapert  with
much  better  Earth  viewing  capability  would  address  this  issue,  but  the  best  and
most  cost-effective  viewing  point  would  be  on  lunar  operations  satellites  at  the
Earth-Moon L1 point.
Outline of the Consequences of No Action on the Proposed Recommendation:

A  viewing  site  on  the  Earth-facing  side  of  the  surface  of  the  Moon  would  also  be
adequate for Earth Science but we are concerned about the infrastructure and costs
involved, particularly if such a site is not associated with the main lunar base. The
Earth  Science  community  has  a  lot  to  gain  from  viewing  platforms  associated  with
Lunar Exploration and input from that community should continue to be sought.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Richard  A.  Anthes,  President,  University  Corporation  for  Atmospheric
Research;  Co-Chair,  Committee  on  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space,
National Research Council, The National Academies

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. At  the  February  13,  2007  hearing  of  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
on  the  Earth  science  decadal  survey,  Dr.  Moore  testified  that  ‘‘through  focusing
on smaller missions and avoiding large, multi-instrumented platforms, a robust
strategy  for  the  future  of  Earth  science  can  be  achieved  with  reasonable  invest-
ments.’’  Could  you  please  elaborate  on  the  potential  for  using  small  missions?
Q1a. What is the advantage of this approach over using large satellites for multiple

instruments?

A1a. There  is  no  simple  answer  to  this  question;  a  mixture  of  a  number  of  small
missions  with  one  or  just  a  few  instruments  (payloads)  and  a  few  larger,  multi-in-
strumented platforms is probably optimal. Small missions are usually much simpler
than the large missions and hence can be carried out faster, at lower cost, and with
less risk. Large satellites carrying multiple payloads can also be efficient by sharing
satellite  and  launch  costs.  In  addition,  it  is  sometimes  important  to  have  measure-
ments of different variables made at the same time and place, and this is more eas-
ily done with a single large platform carrying multiple instruments.

Small, single instrument missions also require less management oversight and co-
ordination  through  the  integration  and  test  phase  of  the  mission.  For  multi-instru-
mented platforms, integrated schedule requirements can become a key driver, where
the slowest instrument drives the schedule (and consequently budget). Smaller plat-
forms  with  fewer  instruments,  therefore,  are  less  constrained  and  can  maintain  a
higher  level  of  flexibility  and  often  efficiency.  The  downside,  of  course,  is  a  higher
relative  cost  of  spacecraft  and  launch  services  associated  with  each  instrument
needing its own mission.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. The  Earth  Science  Subcommittee  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council’s  Science  Com-
mittee  proposed  a  NASA  Earth  Science  Initiative.  That  proposal  involves  re-
directing  support  for  a  planned  FY08  solicitation  for  an  Earth  System  Science
Pathfinder to a decadal survey mission. What is your reaction to that proposal?
A1. Redirecting the planned FY08 ESSP solicitation to implement a decadal survey
mission  is  consistent  with  the  Committee’s  recommendations.  The  requirements  for
Earth  science  observations  greatly  exceed  the  missions  that  can  be  supported  with
the  present  NASA  Earth  science  budget,  which  means  there  is  insufficient  funding
to  support  non-targeted  proposal  opportunities  to  the  extent  needed  to  ensure  a  ro-
bust, innovative total space program. In order to balance the need for new, creative
approaches  with  known  national  observation  needs,  the  Decadal  Survey’s  approach
was to recommend a set of priority science missions and concurrently sponsor ‘‘Ven-
ture  class’’  mission  opportunities.  As  stated  in  the  decadal  survey,  ‘‘The  Venture
class of missions, in particular, would replace, and be very different than the current
Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  mission  line,  which  increasingly  has  be-
come a competitive means for implementing NASA strategic missions.’’ Venture class
missions are intended to provide more frequent funding opportunities for lower cost
investigations  and  are  not  limited  to  traditional  instrument-on-spacecraft  missions.
As  the  Decadal  Survey  suggests,  Venture  class  missions  could  include  stand-alone
missions,  instruments  of  opportunity  flown  on  partner  spacecraft,  or  sets  of  instru-
ments flown on suborbital platforms.

The  current  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  program  has  not  provided
timely,  lower  cost  missions;  moreover,  it  is  difficult  to  develop  a  focused  technology
development program if there is not a clear set of defined missions at low, medium
and higher cost levels. Consequently, the Decadal Study recommended replacing the
ESSP line with Principal Investigator lead Venture class missions and, most impor-
tantly,  to  establish  a  clear  sequence  of  well  defined  missions.  A  healthy  national
program  requires  both  the  named  missions  plus  regular,  lower-cost,  and  competi-
tively selected Venture class missions.
Q2. Your testimony refers to the importance of ensuring adequate instrument charac-
terization,  calibration,  and  validation  in  international  collaborations  on  Earth
observing  missions.  Could  you  please  explain  why  the  characterization,  calibra-

95

tion, and validation are important and what type of information is required for
those processes?

A2. The characterization, calibration, and validation, sometimes called ‘‘Cal/Val,’’ of
all observing systems are part of a quality assurance process that must be an inte-
gral  part  of  any  Earth  observing  mission.  All  raw  observations  (e.g.,  an  observed
value  of  radiation  from  a  layer  in  the  atmosphere)  have  errors—bias  and  random
errors. Converting the raw observations into useful products (e.g., temperature) and/
or  using  them  effectively  in  weather  prediction  models  depend  on  the  algorithms
used to do the conversion, or processing. The algorithms themselves may also intro-
duce  errors.  Without  knowing  all  of  these  error  properties  or  their  characteristics,
the  observations  and  derived  products  are  at  best  useless  and  at  worst  highly  mis-
leading,  contributing  misinformation  to  users.  Thus  all  new  instruments  or  observ-
ing  systems  must  be  calibrated  using  other  independent  observations  with  known
accuracies  and  error  characteristics,  to  make  sure  the  measurements  are  accurate
and  unbiased.  Most  instruments  in  space  need  periodic  re-calibration  as  well,  since
they  may  ‘‘drift’’  away  from  the  truth.  In  addition,  the  process  of  obtaining  the  ob-
servations themselves and generating the data products derived from them must be
validated, so that the quality and other characteristics of the observations and prod-
ucts are known.

The calibration process requires comparison of the measurements at different lev-
els  of  processing  (e.g.,  raw  and  fully  processed  data)  with  a  known  standard,  and
then  making  adjustments  to  the  instrument  or  the  processing  algorithms  as  appro-
priate to reduce or eliminate any biases or other errors. For example, a new weight
scale  may  need  adjustments  to  read  accurately;  without  this  calibration,  the  scale
might  read  two  or  three  pounds  too  high  or  too  low,  thereby  providing  misleading
information.  In  another  example,  a  new  thermometer  must  be  calibrated  so  the
error  and  any  required  corrections  are  determined  (e.g.,  via  calibration  constants)
so that the thermometer can be adjusted to show the true temperature.

The  overall  Cal/Val  process  includes  comparing  the  observations  and  data  prod-
ucts against other observations or analyses, to ensure that they are accurate. Obser-
vations  of  the  same  variable,  such  as  temperature,  from  independent  instruments
and techniques are thus valuable for understanding and documenting the errors as-
sociated  with  the  different  measurements.  Independent  observations  of  the  same
variable  are  also  very  useful  in  weather  prediction  models,  because  they  produce  a
more  accurate  forecast  than  a  single  type  of  observing  system  does.  The  Decadal
Survey report discussed the importance of Cal/Val in a number of places.
Q3. What  detailed  information  would  scientists  require  to  ensure  the  data  provided

by international missions/instruments are of research quality?

A3. Scientists  require  the  raw  data  and  all  the  information  used  to  process  these
data;  they  must  know  and  understand  the  entire  Cal/Val  process.  Without  full
knowledge  of  the  characteristics  of  the  raw  data  and  processing  techniques,  sci-
entists  are  unable  to  verify  the  accuracy  and  other  error  properties  of  the  observa-
tions  and  any  products  derived  from  them.  Deriving  full  benefit  from  the  observa-
tions  requires  full  knowledge  of  the  Cal/Val  process.  Scientists  also  need  to  know
details about the instrument and details of its pre-launch characterization to under-
stand instrument performance prior to launch.
Q4. Your testimony refers to the potential lost opportunities for verifying the effective-
ness of actions to stabilize greenhouse gases, monitoring the efforts of other coun-
tries  to  reduce  greenhouse  gases,  and  ensuring  that  investments  the  United
States  is  expected  to  make  in  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are  working.
Could  you  please  elaborate  on  how  the  U.S.  Earth  observing  system  might  be
used to validate the effectiveness of U.S. policies, including carbon sequestration,
and actions to reduce and mitigate the effects of climate change?

A4. Satellite  observations  have  a  great  role  to  play  in  monitoring  what  other  coun-
tries are doing in a variety of environmental areas including atmospheric and ocean
pollution; deforestation; and other changes in land characteristics, urbanization, and
agricultural practices and yields. In many cases it is impossible to obtain in situ ob-
servations from other countries because of cost, security, and other issues. Satellites
provide the only practical means to observe all countries and their activities includ-
ing emission of greenhouse gases.

As described in the Decadal Survey report, the upcoming Orbiting Carbon Observ-
atory  (OCO)  mission  will  be  particularly  valuable  in  validating  carbon  policy  effec-
tiveness. After launch in 2008, the OCO mission will collect precise global measure-
ments of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth’s atmosphere. The global coverage, spa-
tial  resolution,  and  accuracy  of  OCO  measurements  will  provide  a  basis  to  charac-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

96

terize  and  monitor  the  geographic  distribution  of  CO2 sources  and  sinks  and  quan-
tify their variability. Based on these measurements, scientists will map the natural
and  man-made  processes  that  regulate  the  exchange  of  CO2 between  the  Earth’s
surface and the atmosphere on both regional and continental scales.

Understanding  today’s  regional  and  temporal  patterns  of  CO2 sources  and  sinks
is necessary for reliable projections of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Direct
oceanic  and  terrestrial  measurements  of  carbon  and/or  the  flux  of  CO2 are  impor-
tant,  but  resource-intensive  and  hence  the  observations  are  sparse  and  difficult  to
extrapolate  in  space  and  time.  Space-based  measurements  of  primary  production
and  biomass  are  valuable  and  needed  and,  consequently,  the  Decadal  Study  rec-
ommended the DESDynI and HyspIRI missions.

The current set of direct in situ atmospheric observations is far too sparse for the
determination  of  CO2 sources  and  sinks;  however,  long-term,  accurate  measure-
ments  from  space  of  atmospheric  CO2 column  measurements  with  global  coverage
would allow the determination and localization in time and space of CO2 fluxes both
over  the  ocean  and  over  terrestrial  systems.  What  is  needed  for  space-borne  meas-
urements  is  a  highly  precise  global  data  set  for  atmospheric  CO2 column  measure-
ments without seasonal, latitudinal, or diurnal bias. This is initially being addressed
using  existing  satellite-based  measurements  and  with  the  first  generation  of  sat-
ellite  instruments  designed  specifically  for  passive  CO2 measurements,  such  as  the
Orbiting  Carbon  Observatory  (OCO)  and  the  Japanese  Greenhouse  gas  Observing
Satellite  (GOSAT).  While  these  instruments  will  make  a  major  step  forward  in  our
understanding  of  CO2 distributions,  it  is  internationally  recognized  that  an  active
CO2 mission  using  a  laser  is  the  only  way  to  achieve  observations  at  all  seasons
and all latitudes, day/night coverage, and under both clear and broken cloud condi-
tions.  As  a  result,  the  Decadal  Study  recommended  the  development  of  an  active,
laser-based  CO2 mission,  ASCENDS,  as  the  important  next  step  after  OCO  and
GOSAT.
Q5. Is  there  a  consensus  (among  federal  agencies,  academia,  and  other  users)  on  a
set of climate and environmental measurements to which the nation should com-
mit for sustained observations? If so, what is the set? If not, should there be such
a  set  of  consensus  measurements  and  what  would  be  involved  in  reaching  con-
sensus?

A5. There  have  been  a  number  of  high-quality  and  intensive  studies  with  rec-
ommendations of important climate variables that should be monitored on a contin-
uous  basis,  but  the  lists  of  ‘‘essential  climate  variables’’  generated  by  these  studies
are  rather  long,  sometimes  including  20  or  more  variables.  These  ‘‘essential’’  obser-
vations all contribute to an understanding of the total Earth system, and I support
them.  My  very  short  list  of  absolutely  essential  observations  to  make  on  a  contin-
uous  global  basis  include  solar  and  Earth  radiation,  atmospheric  and  ocean  tem-
perature,  atmospheric  water  vapor,  ozone,  carbon  dioxide  and  sea  level  height.  The
Decadal Survey report recommends several missions to obtain these cornerstone cli-
mate observations: CLARREO, GPSRO, ASCENDS, SWOT, ACE, and PATH. In ad-
dition  to  supporting  climate  monitoring  and  research,  several  of  these  observations
also make important contributions to weather forecasting and warnings (e.g., atmos-
pheric and ocean temperature, atmospheric water vapor and sea level height).

A recent expert reference containing recommendations for important climate vari-
ables  may  be  found  in:  WMO,  2006:  Systematic  Observation  Requirements  for  Sat-
ellite-based  Products  for  Climate.  Global  Climate  Observing  System  (GCOS)-107
(WMO/TD No. 1338).

Question submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. The Decadal Survey recommends that the Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy  study  and  assign  roles  and  responsibilities  among  relevant  federal  agencies
to  establish  a  rational  and  enduring  Earth  remote  sensing  program.  Have  you
briefed OSTP on your report, and if so, how did they react to your recommenda-
tion?

A1. Dr. Berrien Moore and I briefed OSTP on January 30, 2007, just after the time
of  the  release  of  the  NRC  report,  ‘‘Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  Na-
tional  Imperatives  for  the  Next  Decade  and  Beyond.’’  In  addition  to  a  discussion  of
specific observational needs and missions, we discussed the recommendation specifi-
cally to OSTP:

‘‘Recommendation:  The  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  in  collaboration
with  the  relevant  agencies,  and  in  consultation  with  the  scientific  community,
should develop and implement a plan for achieving and sustaining global Earth ob-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:47 Jan 11, 2008 Jkt 036145 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\062807\36145 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

97

servations.  This  plan  should  recognize  the  complexity  of  differing  agency  roles,  re-
sponsibilities,  and  capabilities  as  well  as  the  lessons  from  implementation  of  the
Landsat, EOS, and NPOESS programs.’’

. . .as well as the more general recommendation:
‘‘Recommendation:  A  formal  interagency  planning  and  review  process  should  be
put  into  place  that  focuses  on  effectively  implementing  the  recommendations  made
in the present decadal survey report and sustaining and building the knowledge and
information system for the next decade and beyond.’’

In  response  to  these  recommendations  and  a  perceived  national  need,  OSTP  has
initiated, under the auspices of the U.S. Group on Earth Observations (USGEO) [an
interagency  subcommittee  under  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council],  a
two-pronged strategy to address national Earth observational needs across agencies.
First,  USGEO  is  developing  a  national  Earth  observations  policy  which  builds
upon  the  National  Space  Policy  and  other  existing  policies  to  clarify  roles  and  re-
sponsibilities  of  federal  agencies  in  the  collection,  distribution,  and  preservation  of
Earth observations data. This policy will include guidance on research-to-operations
transitions and international coordination of Earth observations activities.

Second, USGEO is simultaneously pursuing an assessment and planning effort to
begin to establish a national framework that includes existing Earth observation ca-
pabilities,  national  Earth  observation  needs,  and  a  gap  analysis.  USGEO  does  not
intend to inventory or catalog every observational capability in the country, but will
focus on prioritization of the major observational efforts required to address the soci-
etal benefits outlined in both the USGEO Strategic Plan and the NRC Decadal Sur-
vey report.

Because USGEO is a White House group that involves all the active Federal agen-
cies engaged in Earth observations, we are hopeful that both the policy and the as-
sessment/plan will address these important national needs on an interagency basis.
Q2. To what degree are the governments of large developing countries, such as China
and India, taking an interest in climate change research and attempting to miti-
gate  further  damage  to  the  environment?  Do  they  acknowledge  that  climate
change  may  be,  in  part,  a  consequence  of  human  activity?  Has  a  credible  esti-
mate been developed on the amounts of some pollutants released into the atmos-
phere by these countries?

A2. Yes, China and India have great interest in climate change, but it is also fairly
clear that they are not yet doing very much to mitigate the environmental damage,
arguing that they should not be asked to do anything that might hurt their economy
when  developed  nations  like  the  United  States  are  doing  so  little.  China  and  India
both  participated  in  the  latest  IPCC  report  and  agreed  with  its  conclusions.  They
both acknowledge that human activities are a significant part of the cause of global
warming  and  climate  change  (an  IPCC  conclusion).  Yes,  credible  estimates  have
been  developed  on  the  pollution  emitted  by  these  countries,  and  satellites  have
played  a  role  in  these  estimates  (for  example,  aerosols).  China  and  India  are  both
very  large  contributors  to  carbon  dioxide  and  other  pollutant  emissions.  In  2006
China moved ahead of the United States as the number one emitter of carbon diox-
ide. It is clear that without significant actions on the part of all nations, developing
and  developed,  the  emission  of  greenhouse  gases  and  the  resultant  rate  of  climate
change will only increase.
Q3. The Decadal Survey highlighted the importance of developing a strategy to tran-
sition  technologies  from  NASA  to  operational  systems.  How  is  transition  man-
aged today? What steps can NASA take to improve technology transition between
researchers and the applications community?

A3. Frankly speaking, very little of substance has been done to facilitate the transi-
tion  of  research  to  operations  since  the  2003  NRC  report  Satellite  Observations  of
the Earth’s Environment-Accelerating the Transition of Research to Operations. That
report  recommended  the  formation  of  a  joint  NASA–NOAA  Interagency  Transition
Office to develop and implement a strategy to transition NASA research into NOAA
operations.  As  we  said  in  the  Decadal  Survey,  ‘‘An  efficient  and  effective  Earth  ob-
servation system requires an ongoing interagency evaluation of the capabilities and
potential  applications  of  numerous  current  and  planned  missions  for  transition  of
fundamental science missions into operational observation programs. The committee
is particularly concerned with the lack of clear agency responsibility for sustained re-
search  programs  and  the  transitioning  of  proof-of-concept  measurements  into  sus-
tained measurement systems. To address societal and research needs, both the qual-
ity and the continuity of the measurement record must be assured through the tran-
sition  of  short-term,  exploratory  capabilities,  into  sustained  observing  systems.

Transition  failures  have  been  exhaustively  described  in  previous  reports  and  the
committee endorses the recommendations in these studies.’’

In terms of concrete steps, the Decadal Survey (Chapter 5, Earth Science Applica-
tions  and  Societal  Benefits)  in  Part  III  discusses  a  number  of  important  aspects  of
the  process  of  realizing  societal  benefits  from  Earth  observations  through  scientific
research  and  application  development:  ‘‘These  include:  (1)  establishing  mechanisms
for  including  priorities  of  the  applications  community  in  space-based  missions,  (2)
considering studies of the value and benefits of Earth observations published in the
social  sciences  literature,  (3)  creating  closer  institutional  relationships  between  the
science and applications (user) communities, (4) having easy availability to observa-
tions and products derived from observations by the broad user community, and (5)
educating  and  training  new  users  of  Earth  data  and  information,  as  well  as  facili-
tating  the  creation  of  a  scientifically-informed  and  literate  citizenry.  Meeting  these
objectives  will  require  a  greater  involvement  of  social  scientists  (e.g.,  development
policy  analysts,  communication  researchers,  anthropologists,  environmental  econo-
mists)  throughout  the  entire  mission  life  cycle,  in  order  to  make  certain  societal
needs are appropriately considered during the design process, and to ensure societal
benefits are derived from the implemented observations.’’

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Eric  J.  Barron,  Dean,  Jackson  School  of  Geosciences;  Jackson  Chair

in Earth System Science, University of Texas, Austin

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. You  testified  that  the  Decadal  Survey  calls  attention  to  the  need  for  improved
understanding  of  aerosol  cloud  forcing  and  ocean  circulation,  two  areas  ‘‘that
are considered to be the most limiting in terms of our ability to improve climate
model  predictions.’’  What  potential  gains  in  the  predictive  capability  of  climate
models  could  we  expect  if  the  Decadal  Survey’s  Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems
(ACE) and Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) missions were to be imple-
mented?

A1. It  is  difficult  to  be  precise  in  estimating  the  degree  to  which  any  new  set  of
observations  will  improve  our  ability  to  simulate  climate.  Climate  models  have  a
number  of  uncertainties  of  varying  importance,  which  may  in  fact  compound  each
other or serve to obscure the relative importance of individual factors. However, the
improvements can be placed into perspective in a manner that clarifies their impor-
tance.

Aerosol climate forcing is estimated as having a similar magnitude forcing as car-
bon dioxide, but the uncertainty is five times greater. There are several factors gov-
erning this large uncertainty: (a) aerosols have a short life time in the atmosphere,
(b) not all aerosols are alike, and the differences in their character define how they
influence  the  heating  of  the  Earth’s  surface  and  atmosphere,  and  (c)  aerosols  indi-
rectly  influence  climate  through  their  affect  on  cloud  formation,  again  a  significant
factor in defining the Earth’s energy budget. Interestingly, the estimates of the un-
certainties  associated  with  aerosols  have  not  changed  significantly  from  earlier
IPCC  projects,  indicating  that  we  are  making  limited  progress  in  this  area.  The
ACE mission is designed explicitly to tackle this long-standing problem by enabling
a  better  understanding  of  aerosol-cloud  interaction  through  better  accuracy,  finer
resolution and greater spatial coverage.

Ocean topography allows us to monitor sea level and the heating (thermal expan-
sion) of the oceans. In addition, ocean topography is a measure of the ocean surface
circulation.  The  continuous  measurement  of  ocean  surface  topography  since  1992
provides  one  of  the  most  significant  data  sets  available  to  assess  the  capabilities  of
ocean  circulation  models.  However,  SWOT  offers  significant  improvement.  Recent
estimates  indicate  that  current  climate  models  are  overestimating  the  heat  uptake.
In  concert  with  mass  measurements  of  a  GRACE-type  instrument,  significant  im-
provement  in  this  key  attribute  can  be  obtained.  In  addition,  the  improvement  of
our understanding of upper ocean processes depends on our ability to resolve impor-
tant features, specifically ocean eddies. Increased resolving capability can provide a
detailed  picture  of  mesoscale  circulation  that  can  be  used  to  improve  our  under-
standing  of  the  physics  governing  the  ocean  circulation  and  of  the  interaction  be-
tween  the  ocean  and  the  atmosphere,  and  hence  provide  an  important  foundation
for improving climate models.
Q2. The  Earth  Science  Subcommittee  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  proposed  a
NASA  Earth  Science  Initiative.  The  proposal  involves  redirecting  support  for  a
planned  FY08  solicitation  for  an  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  to  a  decadal
survey mission. What is your reaction to that proposal?

A2. The Decadal Survey recommends a set of critical observations with defined pri-
orities  and,  in  addition,  a  class  of  missions  that  enable  a  more  opportunistic  ap-
proach  (to  ensure  that  the  program  remains  innovative  and  able  to  respond  to  new
scientific  discoveries).  The  notion  of  redirecting  a  planned  FY08  solicitation  for  an
Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  to  a  Decadal  Survey  mission  is  a  step  to-
wards achieving the Survey objectives. However, two issues become very important.
First, the current NASA budget is not sufficient to achieve the Decadal Survey’s pri-
ority missions. The proposal is therefore a small part of what must be a much more
strategic  approach  to  Earth  observations.  A  successful  program  must  follow  the
carefully  defined  set  of  missions  described  by  the  Decadal  Survey,  involving  small,
medium,  and  larger  missions  (costs).  It  is  difficult  to  imagine  that  the  systematic
approach  of  the  Decadal  Survey  can  be  achieved  with  ESSP-type  missions.  Second,
we  must  ensure  that  the  strategy  of  the  Decadal  Survey  is  maintained,  with  a  sys-
tematic approach to priority missions and the inclusion of missions that can be inno-
vative  and  creative.  The  later  opportunities  (proposed  as  Venture  class  missions),
as described in the Decadal Survey, are very different from NASA’s ESSP missions,

100

which are largely opportunities to incorporate competition in the implementation of
specific objectives.
Q3. Your testimony refers to potential restrictions on instrument information, access
to  data,  and  software  that  may  arise  in  international  collaborations.  What
would be the implications of such restrictions for climate data sets?

A3. The  climate  record  depends  on  generating  and  sustaining  long-term  records  in
which  the  observational  uncertainties  must  be  smaller  than  the  sought-for  geo-
physical  measurements.  Key  to  a  robust  program  is  to  ensure  (a)  overlap  in  time
between  instruments  in  order  to  identify  and  reduce  calibration  uncertainties,  (b)
transparency  in  programs  for  monitoring  sensor  calibration  and  performance,  (c)
verification  of  the  products  of  analysis  algorithms  and  the  ability  to  reprocess  data
to correct errors in earlier processing algorithms, (d) improved quality of the obser-
vations  within  a  time  series  (as  opposed  to  launch  of  less  capable  instruments),  (e)
avoidance of orbit drift, and (f) validation of geophysical products, providing an inde-
pendent check on the performance of space-based sensors and processing algorithms.
Restrictions  on  data  access,  instrument  information,  and  software  clearly  will  re-
strict  or  raise  questions  about  many  of  these  keys  to  a  robust  climate  record.  The
implication  is  a  reduced  value  to  the  long-term  investment  in  observation  time  se-
ries, largely through increased levels of uncertainty in the climate data sets.
Q4. Is  there  a  consensus  (among  federal  agencies,  academia,  and  other  users)  on  a
set of climate and environmental measurements to which the nation should com-
mit for sustained observations? If so, what is the set? If not, should there be such
a  set  of  consensus  measurements  and  what  would  be  involved  in  reaching  con-
sensus?

A4. Substantial,  but  not  universal,  consensus  exists.  The  2003  Global  Climate  Ob-
serving  System  (GCOS)  report  provides  a  list  of  climate  parameters  (‘‘The  second
report  on  the  adequacy  of  the  global  observing  system  for  climate  in  support  of  the
UNFCCC.’’  GCOS–82,  World  Meteorological  Organization,  Tech.  Doc  1143,  85  pp.,
2003).  This  report  was  adopted  by  the  Climate  Variability  and  Change  Panel  and
provides  a  high  level  of  consensus  on  needed  measurements.  The  Climate  Varia-
bility  and  Change  Panel  then  assessed  current  observing  capabilities  and  those
planned for the coming decade to develop a table within Chapter 9 of critical climate
variables and mission needs.

More  generally,  the  observations  need  to  address  specific  requirements.  Our  ob-
servations must document the forces on the climate system (solar and volcanic activ-
ity,  greenhouse  gases  and  aerosols,  changes  in  the  land  surface  and  albedo),  the
state  of  the  atmosphere,  ocean,  ice  and  land  surface  to  understand  how  the  system
is  changing,  the  characteristics  of  internal  variability  that  may  obscure  long-term
change,  and  the  feedback  processes  involving  the  atmosphere,  land  and  ocean,  bio-
geochemical cycles and the hydrologic cycle. It is the assessment of the Climate Var-
iability  and  Change  Panel  of  the  status  of  current  and  planned  measurements  in
comparison with the GCOS report that defined the critical missions proposed in the
Decadal Survey.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. To what degree are the governments of large developing countries, such as China
and India, taking an interest in climate change research and attempting to miti-
gate  further  damage  to  the  environment?  Do  they  acknowledge  that  climate
change  may  be,  in  part,  a  consequence  of  human  activity?  Has  a  credible  esti-
mate been developed on the amounts of some pollutants released into the atmos-
phere by these countries?

A1. China  and  India  are  both  participants  in  the  IPCC  process  and  have  endorsed
the  conclusions  of  the  report.  Certainly,  this  indicates  a  level  of  acknowledgement
that  climate  is  changing  and  is  significantly  a  consequence  of  human  activity.  The
large  populations  of  India  and  China  make  them  significant  contributors  to  carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases, as well as aerosols. There are reliable estimates
of  greenhouse  gas  contributions  by  the  countries  of  the  world,  and  contributions  of
China  rival  (and  recently  passed)  those  of  the  United  States  in  magnitude.  China
has  instituted  a  major  study  to  look  at  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  China,  in
part  modeled  after  U.S.  reports  to  examine  the  potential  consequences  of  climate
variability  and  change.  Such  research  activities  imply  a  more  active  interest  in  as-
sessing potential damage to the environments of China. However, there is little sign
of efforts to mitigate climate change. My opinion is that the economic growth within
China  and  India  is  the  foremost  factor  in  setting  policy.  Without  global  agreement

on emissions mitigation, between developing and developed countries, there appears
to  be  little  incentive  to  take  action  in  China  or  India.  Research  studies  on  impacts,
as  they  emerge,  may  alter  this  viewpoint.  China’s  new  position  as  the  number  one
emitter of carbon dioxide may also result in greater world pressure to address emis-
sions.
Q2. The Decadal Survey highlighted the importance of developing a strategy to tran-
sition  technologies  from  NASA  to  operational  systems.  How  is  transition  man-
aged today? What steps can NASA take to improve technology transition between
researchers and the applications community?

A2. There  are  two  significant  National  Research  Council  Reports  on  the  transition
of  NASA  technologies  to  operational  systems.  The  first  is  From  Research  to  Oper-
ations in Weather Satellites and Numerical Weather Prediction: Crossing the Valley
of  Death  (2000),  and  the  second  is  Satellite  Observations  of  the  Earth’s  Environ-
ment-Accelerating  the  Transition  from  Research  to  Operations  (2003).  The  invest-
ment  in  transitioning  valuable  information  and  technologies  from  NASA  into  oper-
ations  is  extremely  small.  The  first  report  recommended  a  joint  NASA-NOAA
testbed for promoting transition from research to operations, and a small office was
funded. The second report recommended an Interagency Transition Office to develop
and  implement  a  strategy  for  transition.  The  progress  here  is  small  and  the  prob-
lems  are  numerous.  There  is  a  lack  of  investment  in  the  transition  of  technologies,
there  is  a  lack  of  clear  agency  responsibilities,  and  there  is  a  lack  of  defined  strat-
egy. The consequence is that a very large amount of capability never achieves a sta-
tus of serving society.

I also believe that this is not a matter of just transitioning technologies. One could
cite  numerous  instances  in  which  the  observations,  different  data  sets,  and  model
capabilities  of  NASA  and  NOAA  could  serve  different  segments  of  society  ranging
from  human  health,  water  management,  energy  conservation,  agriculture,  etc.
Today,  we  have  a  very  small  ‘‘applications’’  program,  designed  to  help  provide  data
and expertise for specifically identified needs of society where NASA or NOAA data
can be useful. This is valuable, but, in fact, we have the potential to do much more
to  benefit  society.  For  example,  we  have  the  potential  to  develop  predictive  models
for  adverse  human  health  outcomes  related  to  the  environment  (including  weather
and  climate),  but  this  requires  active,  collaborative  research  in  environmental
health  that  brings  together  climate  researchers  with  the  medical  community  to  de-
fine  the  connections  and  relationships  that  will  enable  such  predictive  capability.
Such  outcomes  don’t  occur  simply  by  providing  data  sets,  it  occurs  by  deliberately
investing  in  areas  that  have  the  potential  to  transform  our  large  investment  in
NASA and NOAA into societal benefits.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Timothy  W.  Foresman,  President,  International  Center  for  Remote

Sensing Education

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. According  to  the  report  of  the  MODIS  Science  Team,  as  documented  in  The
Earth  Observer  publication,  ‘‘The  use  of  MODIS  data  for  land  studies  has  ex-
ceeded  even  our  most  optimistic  expectations  and  has  been  an  unprecedented
success  for  NASA’s  terrestrial  program.’’  Will  follow-on  sensors  to  MODIS  have
the  capability  to  support  the  growing  number  of  applications  derived  from
MODIS data? If not, what will be the impact?

A1. MODIS is an experiment. If MODIS was to become operational, then a growing
number  of  applications  could  depend  upon  the  platform.  Continuity  of  the  sensors
and the MODIS program would have to be carefully discussed with the user commu-
nity  and  appropriate  government  agencies  (e.g.,  NOAA,  USGS)  to  define  any  oper-
ational scenarios.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Could you please discuss some of the applied uses of Landsat data?
A1. There are so many applied uses of Landsat data that any single treatment will
not do justice. The applications in use over the past thirty-five years include a broad
range  of  civil  engineering  uses,  public  health  and  disease  vector  monitoring  uses,
master  planning  and  urban  design,  water  resources,  forestry,  and  a  litany  of  envi-
ronmental  uses.  I  used  Landsat  data  on  behalf  of  the  Department  of  Defense  for
both  environmental  work  and  for  war  planning  in  the  middle  east.  I  use  Landsat
data  for  a  variety  of  projects  while  working  for  the  US  EPA.  And  Landsat  traveled
with  me  to  the  United  Nations  where  good  use  has  been  applied  to  studying  the
dynamics  of  the  planet  over  a  three-decade  period.  There  has  been  not  substitute
for this powerful tool.
Q1a. What  are  the  potential  implications  of  any  disruptions  in  the  long-term

Landsat data record for the applied uses of the data?

A1a. Disruptions  would  be  a  great  disservice  to  the  U.S.  and  the  world.  It  would
be akin to not taking x-rays of your teeth for a ten years after carefully maintaining
your dental health. There is no suitable replacement. If the U.S. allows a disruption,
the  science  community  and  the  state  and  county  managers  will  be  at  a  significant
loss.
Q1b. What  scientific  and  operational  value  do  the  thermal  imaging  data  of  the

Landsat program provide?

A1b. Thermal  data  has  proven  to  be  extremely  valuable  for  a  variety  of  environ-
mental and energy related applications. As energy becomes more adult in the work-
ings of communities, they will find more use for the thermal bands.
Q2. Your testimony refers to non-governmental organizations and their use of Earth
science data to address societal needs. Is there an appropriate role for NASA in
supporting these activities through technical assistance, training, data access, or
other means?

A2. It  is  my  opinion  that  NASA  could  provide  a  great  service  for  the  many  NGOs
around  the  country  and  world.  NASA  has  subsidized  a  variety  of  commercial  busi-
nesses,  but  has  not  been  vary  successful  with  the  NGOs.  A  better  understanding
of  the  challenges,  missions,  and  scale  of  assistance  to  NGOs  would  provide  society
with many benefits.

sition  technologies  from  NASA  to  operational  systems.  How  is  transition  man-
aged today? What steps can NASA take to improve technology transition between
researchers and the applications community?

A1. NASA  would  require  outside  expert  assistance  from  experienced  business  pro-
fessionals to handle the transition of technologies to operational status. The mindset
and experience in NASA does not allow for high success in transitions. Many transi-

tions,  however,  would  be  best  supported  by  quasi-government  arrangements  as  the
sensors  may  be  more  scientific  in  nature  and  use  and  not  lend  themselves  to  com-
mercial enterprise. The major of sensors fall into this category.
Q2. Your statement recommends that NASA ‘‘include Earth as its primary planet of
study and Earth sciences at its core.’’ What do you mean by this statement? Are
you  suggesting  that  NASA  abandon  or  seriously  reduce  other  lines  of  space  re-
search?

A2. As  the  former  chief  environmental  scientist  for  the  United  Nations,  it  is  my
opinion that the scarce resources be applied to studying and monitoring the Earth’s
systems  as  the  alarming  rates  of  extinction,  land  and  soil  degradation,  and  eco-
system  collapses  will  impact  current  and  future  generations.  Robotic  missions  are
the  most  cost  effective  and  allow  for  widespread  web-collaboration  among  students
and scientists around the globe. I would strongly recommend that space exploration
be re-engineered to focus on remote sensing and robotics and not squander precious
time and resources on human-oriented lunar and Mars missions.
