HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The Future of NASA

TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose:

On  Tuesday,  June  28,  2005  at  10:00  a.m.,  the  Committee  on  Science  will  hold  a
hearing  on  the  future  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
(NASA). NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin will be the sole witness. The hear-
ing  will  examine  Administrator  Griffin’s  guiding  philosophy  and  plans  for  NASA’s
programs  in  human  space  flight,  space  science,  Earth  science,  and  aeronautics,  as
well as plans for the Agency’s workforce, organization, and infrastructure. The hear-
ing will set the stage for the Committee’s action the following day on the NASA au-
thorization bill.
Overarching Questions:

1. What are Administrator Griffin’s priorities and how does he plan to maintain

a balanced portfolio of science, aeronautics, and exploration programs?

2. What  is  the  status  of  NASA’s  plans  to  define  the  final  configuration  of  and
research  agenda  for  the  International  Space  Station?  What  is  the  status  of
NASA’s  plans  for  returning  the  Space  Shuttle  to  flight  and  for  retiring  it  at
the end of the decade?

3. What  is  the  status  of  NASA’s  plans  to  define  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration,  including  accelerating  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  and  selecting
launch vehicles?

4. How  does  Administrator  Griffin  intend  to  ensure  the  Agency  has  the  appro-
priate  size  and  skill  mix  in  its  workforce,  as  well  as  the  facilities  and  infra-
structure necessary to support the Agency’s goals?

Overview:

Dr. Michael D. Griffin was sworn in as NASA’s 11th Administrator on April 14th.
Administrator  Griffin  takes  the  reins  of  the  Agency  at  a  crucial  time,  when  NASA
faces significant issues in nearly every facet of the Agency’s operations. Since taking
office,  Administrator  Griffin  has  moved  swiftly  to  begin  tackling  critical  issues  in
many  key  areas.  He  has  been  personally  involved  in  reviewing  plans  for  returning
the  Shuttle  to  flight  later  this  year.  He  has  directed  a  team  to  undertake  a  study,
to  be  completed  in  July,  to  define  the  final  configuration  of  the  Space  Station,  its
research  agenda,  and  to  develop  plans  to  continue  Space  Station  following  the  re-
tirement  of  the  Shuttle,  which  he  has  stated  will  be  in  2010.  He  has  directed  an-
other  team  to  undertake  a  study,  to  be  completed  in  July  as  well,  to  better  define
plans for NASA’s exploration program, including accelerating the Crew Exploration
Vehicle (CEV) to minimize the gap after the Shuttle is retired in 2010 and defining
the launch vehicle options for missions back to the Moon. Griffin has also made sev-
eral significant organizational and personnel changes, including removing many key
managers  at  headquarters  and  realigning  the  reporting  structure  for  NASA’s  field
centers so they report directly to him.

Looking  forward,  Administrator  Griffin  will  have  many  critical  decisions  to  make
over the next year. He will need to install a new management team to replace those
leaving their posts, and key decisions will be made as to what the focus and respon-
sibilities of the various field centers will be and what facilities at those field centers
are necessary to implement the Agency’s goals. So far, Griffin has indicated a strong
preference  for  giving  the  field  centers  more  responsibility  to  manage  programs  and
rebuild the expertise resident within the government.

Over the next year, Administrator Griffin will have many programmatic and tech-
nical issues to address. He will have to decide, once the Shuttle has flown a couple
of times, whether the Agency should move forward with a Hubble servicing mission.
Griffin  will  have  to  decide  whether  to  recommend  a  Shuttle-derived  launch  vehicle

or use existing rockets for heavy lift missions to the Moon, a recommendation to be
made  jointly  by  the  Administrator  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  He  will  also  have
to decide how to pay for increased costs on several programs, such as the recent cost
increase  on  the  Webb  telescope,  while  maintaining  a  balanced  portfolio  of  explo-
ration, science, and aeronautics programs.

On  the  policy  side,  NASA  and  the  Administration  are  still  working  out  proposed
legislative changes to the Iran Nonproliferation Act (INA), which currently prohibits
the  U.S.  from  purchasing  or  bartering  for  Soyuz  capsules  and  Progress  vehicles  for
the Space Station. Without a legislative proposal, it’s difficult to know whether Con-
gress  would  approve  the  change  in  law,  but  if  the  current  law  is  not  amended,  the
U.S. would not be able to have a permanent presence on the Space Station, at least
not until the CEV was available. NASA is reportedly developing plans on how they
would proceed with the station if the law is not changed, should that situation arise.
Issues:
Shuttle Return-to-Flight

Administrator  Griffin’s  first  priority  has  been  to  review  NASA’s  progress  in  pre-
paring the Space Shuttle for return-to-flight. He has personally participated in sev-
eral technical reviews in preparation for the launch. Shortly after becoming Admin-
istrator,  he  postponed  a  planned  Shuttle  launch  in  May  because  of  technical  con-
cerns  with  the  Shuttle’s  External  Tank  and  to  provide  additional  time  to  complete
some of the analysis. The launch is now scheduled for July 13th.

The  Stafford-Covey  Return-to-Flight  Task  Group,  created  to  oversee  NASA’s  im-
plementation of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s (CAIB) return-to-flight
recommendations,  has  approved  all  but  three  of  the  CAIB’s  15  return-to-flight  rec-
ommendations. The three remaining items relate to developing an adequate tile re-
pair capability, completing an analysis of potential sources of debris that could harm
the  Shuttle,  and  hardening  the  Shuttle  against  potential  debris  damage.  The  Staf-
ford-Covey  panel  is  scheduled  to  hold  its  final  meeting  on  Monday,  June  27th  and
will then provide NASA with its final results and recommendations.

Griffin  will  ultimately  make  the  final  decision  on  whether  the  Shuttle  is  ready
to  launch.  The  launch  window  extends  from  July  13th  through  to  July  31st.  The
next launch window occurs in September.
Planning for Human Space Flight: Shuttle Transition and CEV Acceleration

Administrator  Griffin  has  indicated  that  he  will  take  a  different  approach  in  de-
veloping the missions to return astronauts to the Moon. He has created a new Office
of  Program  Analysis  and  Evaluation  (PA&E)  and  charged  it  with  developing  two
critical  plans  for  NASA’s  human  space  flight  programs:  one  to  examine  options  for
how to configure the Space Station to conduct the research NASA must do to enable
human  exploration  in  deeper  space,  to  minimize  the  number  of  Shuttle  flights  nec-
essary  to  finish  putting  the  station  together,  and  to  ensure  the  Shuttle  can  retire
by the end of 2010.

The  second  planning  effort  involves  developing  the  strategy  for  how  to  return  as-
tronauts to the Moon and possibly to Mars, including how to accelerate the develop-
ment  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  to  minimize  the  gap  between  the  retirement
of  the  Shuttle  and  the  first  flight  of  the  CEV,  when  the  U.S.  will  not  have  its  own
capability  of  putting  an  astronaut  into  space.  Both  studies  will  be  completed  this
summer in time to aid key Agency and Congressional decisions.

Administrator  Griffin  has  set  a  goal  to  accelerate  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
(CEV)  so  it  is  ready  as  close  to  2010  as  possible  to  minimize  any  gap.  Griffin  has
also  directed  that  the  CEV  be  designed  to  fly  to  the  Space  Station,  a  requirement
that had not been set previously. NASA recently awarded contracts to two industry
teams  to  begin  preliminary  design  work  for  the  CEV.  Later  this  year,  NASA  is  ex-
pected  to  release  updated  specifications  and  plans  for  accelerating  the  CEV.  A  key
decision will be the selection of the launch vehicle for the CEV program.
Webb Telescope Cost Increase

Recently NASA announced that the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, one
of  NASA’s  highest  priority  space  science  programs,  was  expected  to  increase  by  ap-
proximately  $1  billion  to  a  total  of  $4.5  billion.  Under  current  plans,  the  mission
is  scheduled  to  be  launched  in  2011.  NASA  has  convened  a  science  panel  and  an
engineering  panel  to  review  the  mission,  focusing  on  options  to  control  costs  and
perhaps  scale  back  the  program.  The  panels’  reports  and  recommendations  are  due
to be completed later this summer. Any increases in cost will likely have to be borne
by  the  science  program.  Both  NASA  and  the  scientific  community  will  face  tough
choices  as  the  options  for  dealing  with  Webb  telescope  become  clear  and  a  decision
on whether NASA should conduct a Hubble servicing mission nears.

Workforce and Institutional Issues

The  reduction  in  aeronautics  funding  proposed  in  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget  re-
quest  would  require  the  elimination  of  1,100  civil  service  jobs  at  NASA  centers,  al-
though  NASA  has  also  said  that  there  will  not  be  any  layoffs  in  2006.  In  addition,
NASA  officials  insist  that  there  are  no  plans  to  close  any  NASA  centers.  Also,  the
retirement  of  the  Space  Shuttle  in  2010  will  require  NASA  to  address  the  size  and
skill  mix  of  a  significant  segment  of  the  workforce  at  some  centers.  Work  on  the
CEV  and  other  elements  of  the  mission  to  the  Moon  will  significantly  help  offset
the  loss  of  Shuttle  work,  but  some  jobs  and  skills  may  still  need  to  be  eliminated.
NASA  may  be  able  to  help  affected  employees  take  advantage  of  training,  retrain-
ing, and job placement programs to help the transition.

How  to  ‘‘right  size’’  NASA,  its  facilities,  and  its  workforce,  and  ensure  NASA  has
the necessary skill mix, are among the issues Griffin and Congress will have to face.
Iran Nonproliferation Act Limits Use of the Space Station

NASA  faces  a  legal  hurdle,  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  (INA),  that  could  affect
utilization  of  the  Space  Station  after  April  2006.  The  U.S.  is  totally  dependent  on
Russian  Soyuz  capsules  for  crew  rescue,  and  without  access  to  Soyuz  capsules,
Americans will not be able to stay on Space Station for long duration missions. U.S.
astronauts  will  still  be  able  to  visit  the  Space  Station  using  the  Shuttle  and  will
be able to continue construction of the station, but the Shuttle is not capable of re-
maining  docked  to  the  Space  Station  long  enough  to  provide  a  crew  rescue  capa-
bility.  NASA  policy  prevents  astronauts  from  being  aboard  the  Space  Station  if
there is no rescue capability. Russia is currently providing capsules under an agree-
ment  that  was  grandfathered  into  the  INA.  However,  Russia  fulfills  its  obligation
under  that  agreement  in  April  2006  and  will  no  longer  provide  capsules  or  other
services without payment.

The INA prohibits the U.S. from purchasing or bartering for services from Russia
in  connection  with  the  International  Space  Station  unless  the  President  certifies
that  the  Russians  are  not  proliferating  nuclear  or  certain  missile  technologies  to
Iran—a certification the President is highly unlikely to make. NASA has no known
alternative plans for providing a crew rescue capability beyond buying such services
from the Russians, until the CEV is available.

The matter is currently the subject of an interagency review, and the Administra-
tion is expected to send up a legislative proposal to amend the INA as early as next
month.  However,  it  is  unclear  how  Congress  would  react  to  such  a  proposal  with
Iran  being  such  a  focus  of  attention  in  foreign  policy.  The  International  Relations
Committee shares jurisdiction with the Science Committee over the INA, so any leg-
islative  effort  would  involve  both  committees.  If  Congress  fails  to  amend  the  INA,
the  U.S.  would  not  be  able  to  use  the  Soyuz  as  a  rescue  vehicle  or  to  use  Russian
Soyuz and Progress vehicles to ferry astronauts and cargo, respectively, to and from
the Space Station. NASA has begun the process of developing contingency plans for
the  Space  Station  in  the  event  that  an  exception  in  INA  is  not  made  for  whatever
reason. Without access to Soyuz, U.S. astronauts could be there as long as the Shut-
tle  is  docked,  and  thus  could  continue  to  utilize  the  station  as  long  as  the  Shuttle
is  flying,  but  only  on  short-term  visits.  After  the  Shuttle  is  retired  they  would  not
be able to be there at all until the Crew Exploration Vehicle is available.
The Future of the Hubble Space Telescope

Two  days  after  the  President’s  speech  announcing  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration  in  January  of  2004,  NASA  announced  that  it  would  not  use  the  Shuttle  to
conduct  further  servicing  missions  to  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  Then-Adminis-
trator Sean O’Keefe cited Shuttle safety concerns as the primary reason for his deci-
sion. Widespread criticism led NASA to explore the possibility of a robotic servicing
mission. A December 2004 report from the National Research Council, however, con-
cluded  that  a  robotic  servicing  mission  was  not  likely  to  succeed  in  the  time  avail-
able. In the fiscal year 2006 request, NASA requested funds only for a de-orbit mis-
sion (to ensure that Hubble re-enters from orbit without posing danger to populated
areas).

During  his  April  2005  confirmation  hearing,  however,  Administrator  Griffin
pledged  to  revisit  the  decision  after  the  Shuttle  returns  to  flight  and  its  risks  are
better understood following the post-Columbia modifications. He also directed NASA
engineers to resume planning for a Shuttle servicing mission so they could move for-
ward expeditiously if needed. Work on more advanced space telescopes, such as the
Space  Interferometry  Mission  and  the  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder,  is  being  deferred
in  order  to  preserve  the  option  to  service  Hubble  and  provide  for  its  safe  de-orbit.

Aeronautics Research, Wind Tunnels and Workforce

6

Over the last decade, funding for NASA’s aeronautics budget has declined by more
than  50  percent,  to  about  $900  million.  For  fiscal  year  2006,  NASA  proposes  a  rel-
atively  small  decrease  ($54  million,  or  about  six  percent)  in  aeronautics  research
and  development  compared  to  2005.  The  proposed  five-year  budget  projection  for
aeronautics contemplates substantial funding reductions (20 percent) for aeronautics
research,  together  with  significant  cutbacks  in  its  civil  service  and  contractor
workforces. Civil service personnel and infrastructure costs account for much of the
aeronautics  budget,  largely  because  of  the  expenses  involved  in  the  operation  and
maintenance  of  NASA’s  31  wind  tunnels.  Specifically,  the  aeronautics  program  re-
ceives only six percent of NASA’s total budget, yet it employs more than 20 percent
of the entire NASA workforce and is responsible for 40 percent of all of NASA’s in-
frastructure costs.

NASA  commissioned  a  study  last  year  from  RAND,  which  concluded  that  NASA
should  continue  to  operate  29  of  its  31  wind  tunnels.  RAND  estimated  the  annual
operating  cost  of  all  31  tunnels  to  be  $125–$130  million.  RAND  argued  that  while
some  of  the  tunnels  were  not  well  used  now,  they  offered  capabilities  that  could  be
needed  in  the  future  and  that  would  be  hard  to  replicate  if  the  tunnels  were  shut
down.  RAND  also  argued  that  while  some  questions  that  once  needed  to  be  solved
with wind tunnels could now be answered through computer simulation, many crit-
ical  questions  still  required  wind  tunnels.  It  also  said  that  wind  tunnel  data  were
sometimes needed to develop computer simulation software.

The Committee held a hearing on aeronautics earlier this year and the House ap-
propriations  bill  restores  the  cuts  to  the  fiscal  year  2006  budget.  In  addition,  the
appropriations  bill  includes  a  legislative  provision  directing  the  Administration  to
develop  a  national  aeronautics  policy  to  guide  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  pro-
gram.
Balancing Science and Exploration

The President’s Vision for Space Exploration provides the human space flight pro-
gram with a clear set of goals to guide its programs. Many applaud the Administra-
tion for providing clear direction for the human space flight program, but it has also
made others nervous, particularly in the science community, that the Vision will re-
quire  a  disproportionate  amount  of  NASA’s  funding  and  that  valuable  science  pro-
grams will suffer.

In  the  past,  Congress  has  a  played  an  important  role  in  ensuring  that  a  balance
exists  between  science  and  human  space  activities.  However  last  year,  because  of
the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  implementation  of  the  Vision  and  the  unknown
costs  of  the  return-to-flight  costs  for  the  Shuttle,  Congress  provided  an  unprece-
dented  level  of  authority  to  transfer  funding  between  appropriations  accounts.  The
effect  of  this  authority  was  to  remove  the  ‘‘wall’’  between  science  and  human  space
activities.

Administrator  Griffin  has  stated  that  the  Vision  is  not  intended  to  undermine
other  core  functions  of  the  Agency,  such  as  aeronautics,  space  science,  and  Earth
science,  but  it  is  not  yet  clear  how  NASA  will  maintain  a  balance  between  science
and human space activities within its projected budget.
Organizational and Personnel Changes

Administrator  Griffin  has  moved  quickly  in  making  key  personnel  and  organiza-
tional changes. First, he announced that the directors for each of NASA’s field cen-
ters  would  report  directly  to  him,  instead  of  through  the  Associate  Administrators.
Next,  he  informed  three  of  the  four  Associate  Administrators  (human  space  flight,
science, and exploration) of his intent to reassign them to other positions within the
Agency.  The  fourth  Associate  Administrator  (for  aeronautics)  has  decided  to  step
down.  Additional  personnel  changes  are  expected  over  the  next  several  months  as
Griffin  begins  to  install  his  own  management  team.  An  important  issue  is  how
quickly  he  will  be  able  to  fill  key  slots  to  completely  staff  his  management  team.
FY 2005 Operating Plan Update

On May 11, Administrator Griffin submitted an updated Operating Plan for fiscal
year 2005. The plan provides the first complete picture of how NASA is prioritizing
its funding for 2005. The plan fully funds the $762 million increase above the appro-
priated  amount  for  2005  for  returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight  and  provides  the  full
$291 million appropriated to begin planning for a Hubble servicing mission, as well
as re-programs over $500 million in cost increases for several programs, most nota-
bly  to  cover  costs  for  the  Mars  Reconnaissance  Orbiter,  scheduled  for  launch  this
August, and the New Horizons mission to Pluto set to launch in January 2006. The
plan  also  fully  funds  Congressionally-directed  items,  as  adjusted  for  the  rescission.

Administrator  Griffin  has  said  that  his  overarching  philosophy  in  finding  offsets
is  to  eliminate  lower-priority  programs  rather  than  reducing  all  programs  in  the
face  of  budget  difficulties.  To  do  so,  he  must  set  clear  priorities  within  the  budget
that has been allocated. To pay for the increases included the Operating Plan NASA
is  considering  a  two-year  delay  in  the  Mars  Science  Laboratory  to  2011.  To  pay  for
the  2005  costs  to  prepare  for  a  possible  Hubble  servicing  mission,  NASA  will  defer
work  on  several  advanced  space  telescopes,  such  as  the  Space  Interferometry  Mis-
sion  (SIM)  and  the  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder.  NASA  is  also  reviewing  plans  for  its
nuclear  systems  program,  Project  Prometheus.  NASA  has  indefinitely  deferred  the
Jupiter  Icy  Moons  Orbiter  (JIMO)  and  will  focus  on  higher  priority  and  more  near-
term needs for nuclear power, such as for use as a power source on the Moon’s sur-
face. A summary of NASA’s Operating Plan changes is in the Appendix.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The Committee will come to order.
It  is  a  great  honor  and  pleasure  to  welcome  Dr.  Michael  Griffin
this  morning  in  his  first  appearance  before  this  committee  as
NASA Administrator. Dr. Griffin appeared before us many times as
a private citizen, and he has long served this committee as a trust-
ed  advisor.  The  announcement  of  his  nomination  was  greeted  in
these precincts with something close to glee, and we have not been
disappointed.

Mike has taken on his duties with gusto and with candor. In fact,
it  would  be  easy  to  paint  Mike  as  a  Don  Quixote-like  figure,  lost
in his books. Mike does not realize that idealism has dimmed, and
he  suits  up  and  wanders  about  NASA,  righting  old  wrongs,  ques-
tioning old varieties, and rescuing programs in distress.

But  there  is  an  essential  difference  between  Administrator  Grif-
fin  and  the  man  of  La  Mancha.  The  errors  Dr.  Griffin  is  battling
are real, and the results are consequential rather than comic.

Indeed,  much  is  riding  on  Dr.  Griffin’s  tenure  at  NASA.  Each
and  every  NASA  program  is  facing  fundamental  questions.  What
will  the  CEV  look  like,  and  what  will  we  do  on  the  Moon?  What
kind  of  aeronautics  research  will  NASA  pursue  and  at  what  facili-
ties? Will NASA continue to have a robust Earth science program?
What  is  the  future  of  the  Hubble  and  Webb  telescopes?  What  will
be done about the Iran Nonproliferation Act?

And  those  are  just  a  few  of  the  basic  issues.  In  fact,  more  than
two  years  after  the  President  announced  his  Vision  for  Space  Ex-
ploration,  NASA  can  barely  give  a  definitive  answer  to  a  single
question about its programs. That is not, believe it or not, criticism
of  NASA.  The  Agency  is  rethinking  its  activities,  and  the  answers
will take time. Moreover, Administrator Griffin wisely sent some of
his  teams  working  on  the  answers  back  to  the  drawing  board.  But
it  is  important  to  remember  that  we  are  pretty  much  flying  blind
right  now.  We  expect  to  have  the  first  answers  about  the  human
space flight program some time in July. And NASA will have to an-
swer the most fundamental question about its current manned pro-
grams this week, when it determines whether to return the Shuttle
to flight. As yesterday’s Stafford Covey deliberations indicated, that
is a close question. And I am ready to abide by any decision Admin-
istrator Griffin makes.

But  even  as  NASA  wrestles  with  these  thorny  issues,  congress
needs  to  move  ahead  with  authorizing  legislation.  The  bill  that
Chairman  Calvert  and  I  introduced  yesterday  provides  a  frame-
work for moving forward, ensuring that Congress has the informa-
tion it needs to make more detailed policy calls in the years ahead.
I  look  forward  to  working  with  all  of  the  members  of  this  com-
mittee as we move the bill forward to enactment over the next sev-
eral months.

There  are  two  matters  on  which  the  bill  is  crystal  clear:  first,
that  we  should  move  ahead  with  returning  to  the  Moon  by  2020;
and  second,  that  human  space  flight  programs  cannot  become  the
sole mission of the Agency. Figuring out how to balance those goals
will be no easy task, but it is essential. Part of the answer is ensur-
ing that the Shuttle is indeed retired no later than 2010. But it will
take  more  than  that  to  ensure  that  NASA  continues  to  have  vi-
brant and productive aeronautics, Earth science, and space science

programs,  programs  that  are  not  evaluated  in  terms  of  the  vision
but on their own terms for their own contributions.

I  look  forward  to  working  with  Administrator  Griffin,  who  also
wants  to  see  a  balanced  and  multi-mission  NASA.  And  so  I  look
forward  to  hearing  from  the  Administrator  on  his  latest  thoughts
this morning. If things don’t go well, he can just write us off as one
more windmill he has to tilt with today.

Thank you.
Mr. Gordon.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

It is a great honor and pleasure to welcome Mike Griffin this morning in his first
appearance before this committee as NASA Administrator. Dr. Griffin appeared be-
fore  us  many  times  as  a  private  citizen  and  he  has  long  served  this  committee  as

cincts with something close to glee.

But there’s an essential difference between Administrator Griffin and the Man of
LaMancha:  the  errors  Mike  is  battling  are  real,  and  the  results  are  consequential
rather than comic.

Indeed, much is riding on Mike’s tenure at NASA. Each and every NASA program
is  facing  fundamental  questions:  what  will  the  CEV  look  like  and  what  will  we  do

And  those  are  just  a  few  of  the  basic  issues.  In  fact,  more  than  two  years  after

That  is  not,  believe  it  or  not,  a  criticism  of  NASA.  The  Agency  is  rethinking  its

sent some of the teams working on the answers back to the drawing board. But it’s
important to remember that we are pretty much ‘‘flying blind’’ right now. We expect
to have the first answers about the human space flight program some time in July.
And  NASA  will  have  to  answer  the  most  fundamental  question  about  its  current

Part of the answer is ensuring that the Shuttle is indeed retired no later than 2010.
But  it  will  take  more  than  that  to  ensure  that  NASA  continues  to  have  vibrant
and  productive  aeronautics,  Earth  science  and  space  science  programs—programs
that are not evaluated in terms of the Vision, but on their own terms, for their own
contributions. I look forward to working with Administrator Griffin, who also wants
to see a balanced and multi-mission NASA.

And  so  I  look  forward  to  hearing  Administrator  Griffin’s  latest  thoughts  this

I  want  to  welcome  not  only  Dr.  Griffin,  but  also  our  audience
today. I think the number of folks that are here indicate the signifi-
cance of this hearing, and I am sure there are many more that are
watching elsewhere. So welcome everyone. And as usual, I want ev-
eryone  to  know  that  I  concur  with  my  Chairman  and  his  state-
ment, and we are on board in most ways—and in sync in our direc-
tion for NASA.

Dr.  Griffin,  you  have  come  to  the  job  of  Administrator  with  im-
pressive technical credentials and a wealth of experience. I want to
wish  you  well.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  ensure  that
the  United  States  maintains  a  strong  and  robust  civil  space  and
aeronautics program.

I  count  myself  among  the  supporters  of  the  Exploration  Initia-
tive. I believe that the long-term goals for human space flight pro-
gram  proposed  by  the  President  makes  sense.  At  the  same  time,  I
must  say  that  I  am  concerned  about  where  NASA  is  headed  and
about  the  large  number  of  unanswered  questions  that  remain  al-
most 18 months after the President announced his Exploration Ini-
tiative.

And  let  me  elaborate  for  a  minute  on  some  of  those  unanswered
questions. For example, what is the overall architecture for achiev-
ing the President’s exploration goals? That is, where are we going,
how  are  we  going  to  get  there,  what  are  we  going  to  do  when  we
get there, how long will it take, and how much will it cost?

Last year, we were told that there was a rigorous process under-
way  involving  11  concept  exploration  and  refinement  teams  from
industry  and  academia  working  with  NASA  to  answer  these  ques-
tions. Now we are being told that the process is no longer relevant.
Instead, a small internal NASA team has been tasked with coming
up with an exploration architecture by some time in July.

Another  set  of  questions.  What  is  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
going to do? How are we going to acquire it? And what will it cost?
Last  year,  we  were  told  that  there  was  a  rigorous  process  to  de-
velop  a  ‘‘System  of  Systems’’  concept  for  the  CEV  and  associated
launch  vehicles,  incorporating  a  ‘‘spiral  development’’  acquisition
approach.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  planned  CEV  acquisition  ap-
proach  is  no  longer  relevant  and  that  a  new  approach  is  being
taken in order to accelerate the CEV, but there is no way of know-
ing,  at  this  point,  how  much  it  will  cost  to  accomplish  the  acceler-
ated program.

What is the International Space Station going to be used for, and
what is it going to look like? Last year, we were told that the Inter-
national Space Station research program was being restructured to
more  closely  align  it  with  the  Exploration  Initiative  and  that  Con-
gress would be given the restructured plan last fall.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  entire  ISS  program  content  is
once again being restructured and that it will be later this summer
before  we  will  know  what  those  plans  are.  And  we  hear  that  our
international  partners  are  very  concerned  about  the  impact  on
their plans from NASA’s restructuring.

And what is the priority of the nuclear power and propulsion sys-
tem  in  the  President’s  Exploration  Initiative?  For  the  last  several
years, we were told that the most appropriate demonstration of the

12

Project  Prometheus  space  nuclear  technology  would  be  the  sci-
entific probe to Jupiter’s moons, called the JIMO mission.

Now we are being told that the JIMO mission is essentially dead,
that  Project  Prometheus  is  being  restructured,  and  that  the  main
Project  Prometheus  activity  at  present  appears  to  be  transferring
money from NASA to DOE’s Office of Naval Reactors.

Last  year,  we  were  told  that  it  was  important  to  undertake  the
whole  series  of  exploration  systems  research  and  technology  devel-
opment  projects  at  a  cost  of  more  than  $700  million  in  fiscal  year
2005 alone.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  funding  for  many  of  those  pro-
posed projects has been put on hold. Now I could go on, but I hope
my point is clear. Almost 18 months after the President announced
his  Exploration  Initiative,  basic  questions  are  still  unanswered,
and  much  of  what  Congress  was  told  last  year  is  no  longer  valid.
Yet  in  the  absence  of  needed  information,  Congress  is  being
asked  to  support  the  exact  funding  levels  for  exploration  proposed
in  the  fiscal  year  2006  NASA  budget  request,  almost  $3.2  billion,
and to cut other non-exploration programs in order to free up funds
for the initiative.

That is, we are being asked to make a ‘‘trust me’’ vote on NASA’s
funding  requests,  and  I  might  add  that  is  what  the  previous  Ad-
ministrator not only asked but demanded and received, and you see
where we are.

Dr. Griffin, you have only been on the job for about two months,
and you cannot be held accountable for anything that had gone on
at  the  Agency  prior  to  your  arrival.  At  the  same  time,  given  all  of
the  changes  you  have  made  to  the  exploration  program  since  you
became  NASA  Administrator,  it  would  seem  that  you  have  con-
cluded that none, or rather not all of more than $2 billion allocated
for  NASA’s  exploration  system  program  since  January  2004,  has
been wisely spent.

And  that  is  troubling,  because  even  $100  million  of  that  explo-
ration  system’s  funding  could  make  a  significant  difference  in  the
health  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  or  NASA’s  Earth  science
program.

Yet  the  reality  is  that  under  the  President’s  plan,  those  other
programs  may  increasingly  become  bill  payers  for  the  Exploration
Initiative  in  coming  years,  and  the  healthy  balance  that  should
exist  between  all  of  NASA’s  core  missions  will  be  lost.  That  is  cer-
tainly  going  to  be  the  case  if  NASA  continues  cutting  NASA’s—or
if  the  Administration  continues  cutting  NASA’s  out-year  funding
profile in the upcoming fiscal year 2007 request as it did in the fis-
cal  year  2006  request,  while  at  the  same  time  attempting  to  hold
on to the President’s milestones for his Exploration Initiative.

Unfortunately,  the  results  of  that  approach  are  already  evident.
Some  2,500  current  NASA  employees  are  at  risk  of  losing  their
jobs.  Scientific  missions  are  being  canceled,  deferred,  or  cut,  and
NASA’s  aeronautics  approach—or  program  is  on  a  path  of  becom-
ing  ‘‘irrelevant’’  in  the  words  of  one  of  the  recent  witnesses  before
this committee.

In addition to being a waste of human capital and infrastructure
built  up  at  NASA  over  the  last  forty  years,  I  believe  such  actions
will  make  it  increasingly  difficult  to  sustain  support  for  NASA’s

budget  in  coming  years  as  the  Agency’s  focus  is  narrowed  and  the
overall fiscal situation facing the Nation becomes worse. I hope we
can  avoid  such  an  outcome,  but  I  think  it  will  require  a  course  of
correction within NASA and the White House if that is to succeed.
Now,  Mr.  Griffin,  what  does  all  of  this  mean?  Let  me  tell  you.
You  remember  very  well  a  few  years  ago  when  we  had  a  number
of  votes  at  a  time  when  we  had  a  tough—we  had  world-record
budget deficits, we had a lot of needs here on Earth, and the ques-
tion  was:  ‘‘Should  we  continue  with  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion?’’ And after a number of votes, by only one vote did the Space
Station succeed.

Now what I am afraid that we are going to see is, at a time when
we  have  even  worse  deficits,  even  more  needs  on  Earth,  we  are
going  to  see  a  series  of  attempts  to  take  money  out  of  Mission  to
Mars  and  put  it  here  on  Earth.  And  as  we  do  this,  and  it  is  not
going  to  be  tomorrow,  it  is  going  to  be  in  the  next  three  or  four
years,  during  that  same  period  of  time,  I  am  afraid  that  we  are
going  to  see  a  cannibalization  of  other  programs  in  NASA.  We  are
going  to  see  a  lot  of  long-term  employees  with  expertise  and  core
missions within the centers to be lost.

And  so  the  situation  then  could  very  well  be,  at  this  point,  and
whatever  it  might  be  in  three  or  four  years,  we  have  those  same
kind  of  votes.  The—we  decide  that  money,  rather  than  going  to
Mars,  ought  to  be  placed  in  schools  or  veterans  or  something  else
on Earth, while at the same time, we have already undermined our
existing  programs.  Well,  then  do  we  say,  ‘‘Well,  NASA  now  is  not
relevant  in  even  more  ways,  and  there  are  even  more  cuts.’’  That
is my concern.

And  so  I  also  have  a  suggestion.  And  let  me  tell  you  what  my
suggestion  is.  I  am  taking  a  little  more  time  than  I  normally  do,
maybe  going  back  to  some  previous  times,  because  you  haven’t
been  to  see  me  yet,  and  so  I  want  to  have—take  this  opportunity
to let you know.

Here is what I think that we need to do.
If we are planning on going to Mars in the year 2030, or I guess
it  is  2035  or  beyond,  then  rather  than  30  years,  it  might  be  31
years.  I  don’t  think  we  are  any  worse  off,  and  we  might  save  a  lot
of  money.  What  I  would  hope  you  would  do  is  go  forward  with
those things we know that need to be done. We have got to return-
to-flight.  We  have  got  to  get  this  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  going.
We need to go ahead and look for the—a heavy payload type of lift.
We  have  got  to  do  those  things,  but  let  us  slow  down  in  terms  of
restructuring  NASA  until  we—until  you  answer  those  questions
that  are  out  there.  Let  us  take  this  year  to  try  to  find  out  what
are  those  programs  outside  the  exploration  mission  that  really  are
important.  Let  us  have  some  priorities  there.  Let  us  be  sure  that
we  are  not  going  to  have  this  start-stop  approach  any  longer.  I
think  we  will  save  money.  I  think  it  would  be  the  best  thing  for
NASA, and I hope that you will give that some consideration.

And thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. I guess I am

reclaiming lots of time that I yielded early in the past.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

hearing.

Good  morning.  I  want  to  join  the  Chairman  in  welcoming  Dr.  Griffin  to  today’s

Although  Dr.  Griffin  has  testified  before  this  committee  on  previous  occasions,
this  will  be  the  first  time  we  will  have  a  chance  to  hear  from  him  in  his  capacity
as NASA Administrator.

Dr. Griffin, you come to the job of Administrator with impressive technical creden-
tials  and  a  wealth  of  experience.  I  want  to  wish  you  well,  and  I  look  forward  to
working  with  you  to  ensure  that  the  United  States  maintains  a  strong  and  robust
civil space and aeronautics program.

I  count  myself  among  the  supporters  of  the  exploration  initiative—I  believe  that
the  long-term  goals  for  the  human  space  flight  program  proposed  by  the  President
make sense. At the same time, I must say that I am concerned about where NASA
is headed, and about the large number of unanswered questions that remain almost
18 months after the President announced his exploration initiative.

Let me elaborate for a minute on some of those unanswered questions. For exam-
ple, what is the overall architecture for achieving the President’s exploration goals—
that  is,  where  are  we  going,  how  are  we  going  to  get  there,  what  will  we  do  when
we get there, and how long will it take and how much will it cost?

Last year, we were told that there was a rigorous process underway involving 11
Concept  Exploration  and  Refinement  teams  from  industry  and  academia  working
with  NASA  to  answer  those  questions.  Now  we  are  being  told  that  that  process  is
no longer relevant—instead, a small internal NASA team has been tasked with com-
ing up with an exploration architecture by sometime in July.

Another  set  of  questions:  What  is  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  going  to  do,  how
are we going to acquire it, and what will it cost? Last year, we were told that there
was  a  rigorous  process  to  develop  a  ‘‘System  of  Systems’’  concept  for  the  CEV  and
associated  launch  vehicles,  incorporating  a  ‘‘spiral  development’’  acquisition  ap-
proach.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  planned  CEV  acquisition  approach  is  no  longer
relevant,  and  that  a  new  approach  is  being  taken  in  order  to  accelerate  the  CEV—
but that there ‘‘is no way to know’’ at this point how much it will cost to accomplish
that accelerated program.

What is the International Space Station going to be used for, and what is it going
to  look  like?  Last  year,  we  were  told  that  the  International  Space  Station  research
program was being restructured to more closely align it with the exploration initia-
tive—and that Congress would be given that restructured plan last fall.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  entire  ISS  program  content  is  once  again  being
restructured,  and  that  it  will  be  later  this  summer  before  we  know  what  the  new
plans  are.  And  we  hear  that  our  International  Partners  are  very  concerned  about
the impact on their plans of NASA’s latest restructuring.

What  is  the  priority  of  nuclear  power  and  propulsion  systems  in  the  President’s
exploration initiative? For the last several years, we were told that the most appro-
priate  demonstration  of  Project  Prometheus’s  space  nuclear  technologies  would  be
a scientific probe to Jupiter’s moons, the so-called JIMO mission.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  JIMO  mission  is  essentially  dead,  that  Project
Prometheus  is  being  restructured,  and  that  the  main  Project  Prometheus  activity
at  present  appears  to  be  transferring  money  from  NASA  to  DOE’s  Office  of  Naval
Reactors.

Last year, we were told that it was important to undertake a whole series of Ex-
ploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  development  projects  at  cost  of  more
than $700 million in FY 2005 alone.

Now  we  are  being  told  that  the  funding  for  many  of  those  proposed  projects  has
been  put  on  hold.  I  could  go  on,  but  I  hope  my  point  is  clear.  Almost  18  months
after the President announced his exploration initiative, basic questions are still un-
answered. And much of what Congress was told last year is no longer valid.

Yet in the absence of needed information, Congress is still being asked to support
the  exact  funding  levels  for  exploration  proposed  in  the  FY  2006  NASA  budget  re-
quest—almost  $3.2  billion—and  to  cut  other  non-exploration  programs  in  order  to
free up funds for the initiative.

That  is,  we  are  being  asked  to  make  a  ‘‘faith-based’’  vote  on  NASA’s  funding  re-

Dr.  Griffin,  you  have  only  been  on  the  job  for  about  two  months,  and  you  cannot
be  held  accountable  for  anything  that  had  gone  on  at  the  Agency  prior  to  your  ar-
rival.  At  the  same  time,  given  all  the  changes  you  have  made  to  the  Exploration
program  since  you  became  NASA  Administrator,  it  would  seem  that  you  have  con-

quest.

cluded that not all of the more than $2 billion allocated for NASA’s Exploration Sys-
tems program since January 2004 has been wisely spent.

That’s troubling, because even a $100 million of that Exploration Systems funding
could make a significant difference to the health of NASA’s aeronautics program or
NASA’s Earth science program.

Yet,  the  reality  is  that  under  the  President’s  plan,  those  other  programs  may  in-
creasingly  become  bill  payers  for  the  exploration  initiative  in  coming  years  and  the
healthy  balance  that  should  exist  between  all  of  NASA’s  core  missions  will  be  lost.
That  is  certainly  going  to  be  the  case  if  the  Administration  continues  cutting
NASA’s  out  year  funding  profile  in  the  upcoming  FY  2007  budget  request  as  it  did
in  the  FY  2006  request  while  at  the  same  time  attempting  to  hold  on  to  the  Presi-
dent’s milestones for his exploration initiative.

Unfortunately,  the  results  of  that  approach  are  already  evident:  Some  2,500  cur-
rent  NASA  employees  are  at  risk  of  losing  their  jobs;  scientific  missions  are  being
canceled,  deferred,  or  cut;  and  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  is  on  a  path  to  becom-
ing  ‘‘irrelevant,’’  in  the  words  of  one  of  the  recent  witnesses  before  this  committee.
In  addition  to  being  a  waste  of  the  human  capital  and  infrastructure  built  up  at
NASA  over  the  last  40  years,  I  believe  such  actions  will  make  it  increasingly  dif-
ficult  to  sustain  support  for  NASA’s  budget  in  coming  years  as  the  Agency’s  focus
is  narrowed  and  the  overall  fiscal  situation  facing  the  Nation  worsens.  I  hope  we
can  avoid  such  an  outcome,  but  I  think  it  may  require  a  course  correction  within
NASA and the White House if we are to succeed.

Well, we have a lot to talk about today. I again want to welcome you to this morn-

ing’s hearing, Dr. Griffin, and I look forward to your testimony.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The spirit of cooperation.
The Chair is pleased to recognize the distinguished Chairman of
the  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics,  Mr.  Calvert  of  Cali-
fornia.

Mr.  CALVERT.  And  in  the  spirit  of  brevity,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will

be very brief.

Today, we welcome NASA’s 11th Administrator, Dr. Mike Griffin,
and  his  first  appearance  before  this  committee.  Tomorrow,  we  will
mark up the first NASA authorization bill in a number of years in
the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, which I am certainly
happy  to  Chair.  And  I  am  very  hopeful  that  we  will  be  able  to  get
this  bill  through  the  House  of  Representatives  before  the  August
work  period  where  we  can  go  into  conference  with  the  United
States Senate.

Dr. Griffin, you are certainly a breath of fresh air for NASA, and
we are really looking forward, as you can tell, to working with you
to build a better and stronger NASA together.

As  you  know,  we  are  beginning  a  second  space  age,  as  I  like  to
put  it.  The  first  space  age  was  born  in  the  Cold  War.  The  second
space  age  will  feature  space  exploration  while  achieving  synergy
with  commercial,  civil,  national  security  space  programs.  Doctor,
you  are  in  a  place  to  lead  us  in  the  second  space  age,  and  we  will
work together to build a better NASA.

For  NASA  to  develop  an  overall  grand  strategy,  we  must  have
a  strategy  for  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  and  technology  as  well
as  a  multi-year  plan  for  NASA’s  science  programs  that  parallel
NASA’s  vision  for  space  exploration.  Once  we  have  well  defined
mission  strategies,  NASA  will  be  able  to  move  forward  more  effec-
tively and efficiently in its core areas.

As  you  know,  I  plan  on  visiting  all  of  the  NASA  centers  in  this
Congress,  and  so  far  I  have  visited  Kennedy  Space  Center.  I  plan
to be at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on July 3 to observe the cli-
max  of  Deep  Impact  program  as  it  collides  with  a  comet,  and  for

the  first  time,  we  will  have  a  good  look  inside  a  comet.  This  will
be an exciting evening.

At  each  of  these  centers,  I  have  been  impressed  with  the  enthu-
siasm, dedication, and the technical skills of the workforce. I spoke
with  a  number  of  workers  who  were  preparing  the  Space  Shuttle
for  return-to-flight,  processing  components  of  International  Space
Station,  conducting  life  science  research,  and  testing  experimental
vehicles.  This  NASA  community  is  comprised  of  a  talented  work-
force with skills that America cannot afford to lose.

I  believe  that  Mike  Griffin  is  the  right  person  to  lead  this  tal-
ented workforce in a direction to benefit our nation and to enhance
our competitiveness globally. Administrator Griffin said in a speech
last  week,  ‘‘My  feet  are  firmly  grounded  in  reality,  but  I  am  also
grounded in the idea that we need to change some of the definition
of reality.’’

I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  as  we  change  the  definition
of reality and work into this second space age, and I certainly wel-
come your testimony today.

And I yield back the balance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

Today,  we  welcome  NASA’s  11th  Administrator,  Dr.  Michael  Griffin,  in  his  first
official  appearance  as  Administrator  before  the  House  Science  Committee.  Tomor-
row, we will mark up the first NASA Authorization in a number of years in the Sub-
committee on Space and Aeronautics, which I chair. I am very hopeful that we will
be able to get our bill through the House of Representatives before our August dis-
trict work period.

Dr.  Griffin  is  a  breath  of  fresh  air  for  NASA  and  we  are  really  looking  forward
to  working  with  him  as  we  build  a  better  and  stronger  NASA  together.  We  are  be-

to  lead  us  in  this  Second  Space  Age  as  we  work  together  to  make  a  better  NASA.
For  NASA  to  develop  an  overall  grand  strategy,  we  must  have  a  multi-year  plan
for  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  and  technology  as  well  as  a  multi-year  plan  for

we  have  well-defined  missions  and  strategies,  NASA  will  be  able  to  move  forward
more effectively and efficiently in all its core areas.

I  plan  to  visit  all  the  NASA  centers  this  Congress  and  so  far,  have  visited  the
Kennedy  Space  Center  and  Dryden  Flight  Research  Center.  I  plan  to  visit  the  Jet
Propulsion Laboratory on July 3, to observe the climax of the Deep Impact program
as  it  collides  with  a  comet  and  we  have  our  first  look  inside  a  comet.  At  each  of
these centers, I have been impressed with the enthusiasm, dedication and technical
skills  of  the  workforce.  I  spoke  with  a  number  of  the  workers  who  are  preparing

that America cannot afford to lose.

I  believe  that  Mike  Griffin  is  the  right  person  to  lead  this  talented  workforce  in

ministrator  Griffin  said  in  a  speech  last  week,  ‘‘my  feet  are  firmly  grounded  in  re-
ality, but I am also grounded in the idea that we need to change some of the defini-

I  look  forward  to  working  with  Administrator  Griffin  as  we  change  the  definition

of reality and move into this Second Space Age.

I welcome Dr. Griffin to testify today.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Calvert.  And
thank  you  for  the  leadership  you  are  providing  in  the  Sub-
committee during a very important time for the Agency.

17

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  morning,  Dr.  Grif-

fin.

I  am  going  to  hopefully—put  myself  in  the  same  spirit  as  my

chairman, Mr. Calvert, and be brief.

If I could, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask for unanimous con-

sent to include my entire statement in the record.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Without objection.
Mr.  UDALL.  Dr.  Griffin,  I  think  it  may  be  a  bit  of  a  clich´ e,  but
I  think  it  is  worth  saying  that  NASA  is  at  a  crossroads,  and  this
is the focus that we want to have at this hearing is how we balance
all of these competing interests. The President has given us a new
long-term  vision  for  human  space  flight.  I  support  that  vision,  but
I  am  not  sure  how  all  of  these  aspirations,  as  I  just  said,  fit  into
the budget that has been provided to NASA.

Congressman  Calvert,  Congressman  Gordon,  and  Congressman
Boehlert talked about the aeronautic side of NASA. I have concerns
based  on  what  we  have  heard  recently  from  non-government  wit-
nesses,  and  looking  at  the  President’s  budget,  I  think  those  con-
cerns  are  worth  considering.  That  is  one  of  the  reasons  I  intro-
duced,  along  with  a  group  of  bipartisan  supporters,  H.R.  2358,  the
Aeronautics  R&D  Revitalization  Act,  which  I  would  like  to  see  in-
corporated into the NASA reauthorization.

The  concerns  I  have  also  heard  from  the  fundamental  biology
and  microgravity  research  communities,  as  well  as  from  commer-
cial organizations, and about what we are going to do in the areas
of  Earth  and  space  science,  I  think,  are  worth  hearing.  And  I  look
forward to your testimony today in that regard.

As  I  close,  I  do  want  to  thank  you  for  your  willingness  to  start
preparing for a Shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble space tele-
scope,  contingent,  of  course,  on  a  successful  return-to-flight  of  the
Space  Shuttle.  It  is  one  of  the  most  significant  space  laboratories
ever  launched,  and  I  believe  we  should  continue  to  utilize  it  to  its
fullest capacities as long as it remains productive.

So  again,  Doctor,  it  is  a  tremendous  opportunity  to  have  you
here.  Thank  you  for  your  service.  And  I  look  forward  to  hearing
your testimony and engaging further with you in the question and
answer period.

Mr. Chairman, I would yield back any time I have remaining.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Udall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good  morning  and  welcome,  Dr.  Griffin.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  in
the months ahead, and I wish you all the best as you shoulder your new responsibil-
ities.

While  it  can  sound  like  a  bit  of  a  cliche´ to  say  that  NASA  is  at  a  crossroads,  I

think it nonetheless is an accurate description of the current situation.

The President has given NASA a new long-term vision for its human space flight
program—one  that  I  support.  At  the  same  time,  it’s  not  at  all  clear  that  the  Presi-
dent’s aspirations fit the budget that has been provided to NASA.

And  one  result  of  that  mismatch  is  that  the  highly  productive  balance  that  has
existed between NASA’s space science, Earth science, aeronautics, and human space
flight activities is at risk of being seriously damaged.

The  evidence  of  the  stresses  on  NASA’s  non-exploration  programs  is  all  around

At  a  recent  hearing  before  the  Space  Subcommittee,  there  was  unanimity  among
all  of  the  non-government  witnesses  that  NASA’s  aeronautics  programs  have  been

us.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

negatively impacted by the budget cuts of recent years and that the President’s pro-
posed five-year budget for aeronautics will significantly worsen the situation.

That is one of the reasons I and a bipartisan group of co-sponsors introduced H.R.
2358,  the  Aeronautics  R&D  Revitalization  Act,  which  I  would  like  to  see  incor-
porated into the NASA Authorization.

The  situation  facing  NASA’s  Earth-Sun  Systems  program  is  no  better.  The
Science  Committee  heard  compelling  testimony  from  a  panel  of  respected  experts
that bluntly concluded that the Nation’s Earth observations program is at risk. And
we have heard about productive missions being threatened with termination due to
budgetary shortfalls.

In  addition,  although  we  have  not  yet  had  a  Space  Station  oversight  hearing,  I
and my staff have been hearing from the fundamental biology and micro-gravity re-
search community, as well as from commercial organizations.

Their message is the same.
For more than 15 years, NASA has been telling them that there would be a place
for their research on the ISS. Now however, it appears that the budgetary demands
of  the  exploration  initiative  are  going  to  cause  NASA  to  break  those  long-standing
commitments.

While  all  of  this  has  been  going  on,  the  unfortunate  fact  is  that  18  months  after
the  President  first  announced  his  exploration  initiative,  specifics  on  NASA’s  plans
are  still  hard  to  come  by.  That  concerns  me,  especially  given  the  fact  that  the  spe-
cifics we do have from NASA concern cuts to NASA’s non-exploration programs.

I hope that Dr. Griffin will be able to shed some light on what NASA’s plans are
for both exploration and for NASA’s other core missions, as well as for its workforce.
We  will  need  that  information  if  we  are  to  do  our  oversight  jobs  properly,  and  I
think enough time has passed for us to be justified in asking for specifics.

Finally,  before  I  close,  I  would  just  like  to  express  my  appreciation  to  Dr.  Griffin
for  his  willingness  to  start  preparing  for  a  Shuttle  mission  to  service  the  Hubble
space  telescope,  contingent  of  course  on  a  successful  return-to-flight  of  the  Space
Shuttle.

As  you  know,  Hubble  is  one  of  the  most  significant  space  observatories  ever
launched,  and  I  believe  that  we  should  continue  to  utilize  it  to  its  fullest  as  long
as it remains scientifically productive.

Mr. Chairman, today’s hearing is an important one for this committee, and I look

forward to hearing from our witness. Thank you.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
How is that for a warm welcome?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Very interesting.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing on the future of NASA. On the
eve of the Subcommittee markup of the NASA Authorization bill, it is useful to hear
what the Administrator of the space agency thinks about the future of the organiza-
tion.

Dr. Griffin, I would like to congratulate you on your new position as the 11th Ad-
ministrator  of  NASA.  You  have  a  challenging  task  ahead,  but  I  know  that  you  are
more  than  capable  of  leading  this  agency  into  a  bright  and  exciting  future.  I  am
already pleased with the direction you have been going since taking the position on
April 14.

When President Bush announced the new Vision for Space Exploration in January
2004, I was excited to see that NASA had a new direction and focus for the future.
Our  ventures  into  space  not  only  keep  America  at  the  forefront  of  exploration  and
innovation,  but  they  also  are  vital  to  our  economy  and  our  national  security.  This
new  Vision  sets  America  on  a  course  toward  the  Moon  and  Mars,  and  we  should
embrace this dream and work to make it a reality.

The money that we put into NASA grows exponentially when we consider the sci-
entific and technological spin-offs that space exploration provides. Experiments con-
ducted  on  the  Space  Shuttle  and  International  Space  Station  expand  health  re-
search and move us toward cures for some of our most threatening diseases. Micro-
gravity  experiments  in  the  1990s  led  to  advances  in  antibiotics  to  fight  infections.
These experiments also unlocked secrets to protein growth that produced medicines
to treat patients who have suffered from strokes and to prepare them for open-heart
surgery.  Americans  suffering  from  osteoporosis  also  benefit  from  bone-density  ex-
periments  conducted  on  the  International  Space  Station  in  microgravity  environ-
ments.  These  tests  accelerated  the  clinical  trials  of  a  drug  that  is  expected  to  be

on the market soon. From the development of MRI technology to microchips, the sci-
entific  partnerships  between  NASA  and  American  universities  and  companies  en-
sure our nation’s viability, increase our nation’s competitiveness, and help drive our
economy.

A  few  weeks  ago,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  the  astronauts  who  will  be
returning to flight next month on the Shuttle. Returning the Shuttle to flight is the
first  step  toward  meeting  the  goals  of  the  Vision,  and  it  helps  America  fulfill  its
promise  to  our  international  partners  to  complete  the  International  Space  Station.
I  know  that  NASA  has  made  progress  toward  making  the  Shuttle  as  safe  as  pos-
sible, and I am pleased that the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) ap-
proves of many of the changes the Agency has made.

Retiring  the  Shuttle  in  2010  and  moving  to  a  newer,  safer  vehicle  is  a  welcome
goal.  As  contractors  develop  the  new  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  for  human  space
flight,  we  need  to  make  sure  that  a  viable  crew  escape  system  for  our  astronauts
is  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the  spacecraft.  As  we  implement  the  new  space
vision, I will work to ensure that NASA fulfills this priority and minimizes the risks
for  our  brave  men  and  women  who  fly  our  space  missions.  Our  hopes  and  dreams
ride with them, and we must do all we can, at whatever cost is necessary, to ensure
their safety.

Dr.  Griffin,  thank  you  again  for  coming  to  Capitol  Hill  today  to  tell  us  of  your
plans  for  NASA.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  your  staff  to  reach  these
goals together and move America toward its destiny in space.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Weldon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE CURT WELDON

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Administrator Griffin, I appreciate the

opportunity to submit my testimony for the record.

First, I would like to officially congratulate Administrator Griffin on his new posi-
tion  and  thank  him  for  taking  the  time  to  come  to  Capitol  Hill  and  address  the
Committee’s  questions  and  concerns.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  him  to  create
a stronger more viable NASA.

I  also  look  forward  to  the  Shuttle’s  possible  Return-to-Flight  later  this  month.  I
trust the Administrator’s experience and expertise will enable him to make the right
decisions about the safety of the Shuttle’s launch while taking into account the rec-
ommendations set forth by the Stafford Covey Return-to-Flight Task Group (SCTG).
I  do  support  NASA’s  desire  to  further  explore  space  and  recognize  the  immeas-
urable  value  in  learning  more  about  our  solar  system,  but  I  would  be  remiss  if  I
did not voice my concerns over the projected costs of the President’s Vision for Space
Exploration.  I  am  concerned  that  too  much  of  our  precious  resources  and  funding
will be diverted away from other NASA programs in favor of space exploration.

As  a  senior  Member  of  this  committee,  over  the  past  several  years,  I  have  wit-
nessed the decrease and now elimination of funds for rotorcraft research. As an ag-
gressive  supporter  of  rotorcraft  funding  and  research,  I  am  greatly  concerned  that
this  important  program  is  being  neglected.  NASA  has  cut  aeronautics  research  by
half  between  1998  and  2003  and  requested  zero  dollars  for  its  rotorcraft  research
programs for FY03–FY06.

I  am  truly  concerned  about  what  will  happen  to  the  U.S.  Aeronautic  industry  if
the  Federal  Government  continues  to  ignore  rotorcraft  funding.  As  you  know,  the
U.S.  aerospace  industries  are  highly  reliant  on  technologies  enabled  by  NASA  re-
search.  Aerospace  business  markets  today  make  it  difficult  for  companies  to  invest
huge  sums  in  high-risk,  long-term  R&D  activities.  The  consequences  of  insufficient
research and development investment are already being felt. There is a direct rela-
tionship  between  the  viability  of  federal  aeronautics  R&D  conducted  by  NASA,  the
future of the U.S. aeronautics and transportation industry, and economic growth.

I fear that our country’s neglect of rotorcraft could pave the way for other nations
to  surpass  the  United  States  in  development  of  a  technology  with  the  potential  to
change the way we travel. To this end, I have established the Center for Rotorcraft
Innovation (CRI), which will provide a single, coordinated, national focus within in-
dustry  and  academia  for  cooperation  with  the  government  on  rotorcraft.  CRI  will
focus  on  emerging  and  unmet  national  needs  in  rotorcraft  operations  and  tech-
nology, and will function as a venue where the public and private sectors can work
together for the sake of the American rotorcraft industry.

In  my  opinion,  the  establishment  of  future  rotorcraft  technology,  systems  and  in-

cans  in  harms  way  for  the  purpose  of  emergency  evacuation,  combat  and  logistical
support.

So in closing, I would just like to again reiterate my disappointment that this im-
portant program has consistently suffered major funding cuts. I ask that the Admin-
istrator  provide  me  with  information  on  his  vision  for  the  future  or  Aeronautics
funding,  specifically  Rotorcraft  within  NASA.  In  the  meantime,  I  will  continue  to
use  my  position  as  a  senior  member  of  this  committee  and  Vice-Chairman  of  the
Armed  Services  and  Homeland  Security  Committees  to  advocate  and  fight  for  in-
creased federal rotorcraft and aeronautics dollars. Thank you for you time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  morning.  I  want  to  thank  Administrator  Griffin  for  appearing  before  our
committee  to  discuss  the  FY06  Budget  for  NASA.  Today’s  hearing  serves  as  an  op-
portunity  for  oversight  of  certain  departmental  programs.  My  colleagues  on  the
Science Committee and I have been calling for the Administration to establish a vi-
sion  for  the  space  program  even  before  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  tragedy.  Last
year,  when  the  President  announced  his  space  exploration  initiative,  I  was  pleased
we were setting long-term goals for our nation’s human space flight program. How-
ever, a year later many of NASA’s plans and organizational arrangements for imple-
menting  the  initiative  are  in  flux.  I  am  concerned  that  NASA  is  proceeding  aggres-
sively on the implementation of the President’s exploration initiative and is making
fundamental  changes  in  its  priorities  without  providing  Congress  with  more  spe-
cifics  as  we  consider  the  FY06  budget  request  for  NASA.  While  the  Administration
continues  to  bolster  this  initiative  and  state  it  is  affordable  under  the  budgetary
plan developed by NASA, NASA’s track record on the credibility of its cost estimates
over  the  last  several  years  is  at  best  mixed.  The  President’s  proposal  will  have  a
high price tag and it should not come at the cost of our commitment to our children,
our veterans, our seniors, and our other important domestic priorities. We currently
have  over  a  half-trillion  dollar  deficit  and  the  case  is  going  to  have  to  be  made  to
this  committee  and  the  American  people  why  this  proposal  should  be  supported  in
the face of that deficit.

In  last  year’s  FY05  Omnibus,  the  appropriators  gave  NASA  a  great  deal  of  lati-
tude  to  determine  the  allocation  of  the  funds  appropriated  to  it,  with  the  under-
standing  that  the  appropriations  committees  would  review  that  allocation  as  part
of  the  standard  Operation  Plan  process.  I  realize  it  is  too  early  to  draw  definitive
conclusions about NASA’s performance on the exploration initiative because most of
its  efforts  over  the  last  year  have  been  focused  on  developing  requirements  and
‘‘roadmaps’’  and  restructuring  its  organization.  Yet,  the  all  of  these  efforts  are  still
unclear  at  this  point.  Since  Administrator  Griffin  has  indicated  that  he  intends  to
significantly  reshape  NASA’s  human  exploration-related  program  and  has  sus-
pended  or  terminated  many  of  the  exploration-related  planning  activities  that  were
underway  when  he  became  Administrator,  I  am  concerned  NASA’s  commitment  to
building the Agency’s core foundation of aeronautics and aerospace research and de-
velopment as well as its missions of exploration are overlooked.

I welcome the Administrator and look forward to his testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for hosting this hearing, and
Mr. Griffin, thank you for joining us today to discuss the future of NASA. I am very
interested in hearing your testimony.

Many  on  this  committee  have  been  paying  attention  to  NASA’s  budgetary  deci-
sions and what these choices mean for the long-term direction of the Agency. In par-
ticular,  I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  perspective  on  how  or  if  NASA  will  be  able
to  balance  the  President’s  space  exploration  agenda  with  the  Agency’s  traditional
multi-mission approach.

We  are  pleased  to  have  you  with  us  for  the  first  time  and  I  look  forward  to  this

morning’s hearing.

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  hearing  to  discuss  The  Future
of  NASA.  I  want  to  welcome  Dr.  Griffin,  the  new  NASA  Administrator  and  thank
him  for  coming  before  this  committee  this  morning.  NASA  faces  a  watershed  mo-
ment after having endured a tremendous tragedy in the Columbia disaster and now
trying to map its future with a return to the Moon and manned exploration of Mars.
Unfortunately,  while  I  wholeheartedly  support  the  work  of  NASA,  I  am  deeply
concerned  that  the  President’s  budget  does  not  meet  all  the  needs  for  future  space
exploration as we move forward in this new century. A lack of necessary budget au-
thority  makes  the  job  for  a  new  Administrator  much  more  difficult  and  brings  in
to  question  the  true  vision  for  NASA.  As  I  have  stated  before,  this  Administration
has  made  many  bad  budgetary  choices,  which  continue  to  push  us  further  into  a
huge  deficits  and  mounting  debt  during  the  last  four  years.  In  addition,  the  Presi-
dent  has  proposed  a  highly  questionable  plan  for  Social  Security  along  with  an  un-
certain  military  future  in  Iraq  that  in  conjunction  with  proposed  $1.6  trillion  tax
cuts will result in less funds being available for vital agencies such as NASA.

I  have  been  supportive  of  President  Bush’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  because
I  firmly  believe  that  the  investment  we  make  today  in  science  and  exploration  will
pay large dividends in the future. Similarly, I do not want to put a cap on the fron-
tiers  of  our  discovery,  NASA  should  aim  high  and  continue  to  push  our  nation  at
the  forefront  of  space  exploration.  However,  I  find  it  hard  to  be  more  supportive  of
the  President’s  plan,  when  I  have  no  real  specifics  as  to  what  this  plan  will  entail.
Large missions of this sort require detailed planning and as a Members of Congress
we deserve to know how exactly the President’s plan proposes to accomplish its ob-
jectives so that we can set out the proper resources and provide the necessary over-
sight.  In  addition,  the  President  stated  that  the  fundamental  goal  of  his  directive
for  the  Nation’s  space  exploration  program  is  ‘‘. . .to  advance  U.S.  scientific,  secu-
rity,  and  economic  interests  through  a  robust  space  exploration  program.’’  I  could
not agree more with that statement; unfortunately, this President’s own budget does
not  meet  the  demands  of  his  ambitious  agenda.  One  year  after  the  Administration
laid  out  a  five-year  funding  plan  for  NASA  that  was  intended  to  demonstrate  the
affordability and sustainability of the exploration initiative, the Administration sub-
mitted  a  budget  proposal  for  2006  that  would  reduce  that  funding  plan  by  $2.5  bil-
lion  over  the  next  four  years.  For  example,  in  2006,  the  Administration  is  seeking
$546  million  less  than  it  said  would  be  needed  for  NASA  in  2006  in  the  five-year
funding plan that accompanied last year’s request. In fact 75 percent of the $2.5 bil-
lion  shortfall  will  fall  to  NASA’s  science  and  aeronautics  programs.  This  kind  of
under-funding  for  vital  programs  is  unacceptable.  Again,  it  is  even  more  alarming
because  the  President  has  not  provided  a  detailed  plan  as  to  how  he  intends  to  ac-
complish  his  space  exploration  agenda;  certainly  draining  money  from  the  budget
will not help that cause. I hope Administrator Griffin will be able to shed some light
on the vision of NASA with the current budget shortfalls.

My  greatest  concern  at  this  point  is  that  we  may  not  allocate  enough  money  or
resources to ensure the safety of all NASA astronauts and crew. After the Columbia
disaster,  safety  must  be  our  highest  priority  and  it  is  worrisome  that  there  is  not
a  noticeable  increase  in  funding  to  address  all  safety  concerns.  Presently,  NASA  is
working  towards  a  resumption  of  Space  Shuttle  flights,  with  the  date  for  such  a
launch  in  uncertainty  at  this  point.  However,  once  NASA  returns  the  Shuttle  to
flight  status,  it  is  then  supposed  to  begin  the  task  of  figuring  out  how  to  retire  the
Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 while continuing to fly the Shuttle safely up to the very
last flight. I am concerned that pressure to retire the Shuttle by a fixed date to free
up resources for other activities, coupled with the need to fly up to 28 Shuttle flights
to  assemble  the  Space  Station,  could—if  not  handled  properly—lead  to  the  types  of
schedule  and  budgetary  pressures  that  were  cited  by  the  Columbia  Accident  Inves-
tigation Board (CAIB) as contributing to the Columbia accident. I hope this concern
is paramount at NASA as we move forward in the future.

As  Members  of  this  committee  know,  I  have  always  been  a  strong  advocate  for
NASA. My criticism of the President’s budget and its relation to the vision for NASA
is  intended  only  to  strengthen  our  efforts  to  move  forward  as  we  always  have  in
the  area  of  space  exploration  and  discovery.  NASA  posses  an  exciting  opportunity
to charter a new path that can lead to untold discoveries. As always I look forward
to  working  with  the  good  men  and  women  of  NASA  as  we  push  the  boundaries  of
our world once again.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE AL GREEN

Chairman Boehlert and our Ranking Member, Mr. Gordon, I appreciate the oppor-
tunity  that  you  have  provided  us  to  speak  to  the  newly  appointed  Administrator  of
NASA, Dr. Michael Griffin. First and foremost, Administrator Griffin, let me extend
my congratulations.

As  a  Member  of  the  Science  Committee,  I  have  had  the  distinct  pleasure  of  fol-
lowing NASA’s progress as it has moved towards its Return-to-Flight mission sched-
uled  in  mid  to  late  July.  I  have  also  followed  NASA  while  it  has  re-defined  itself
behind  President  Bush’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  Let  me  reiterate  my  support
for NASA.

With  Johnson  Space  Center  only  moments  away  from  the  9th  Congressional  Dis-
trict  of  Texas,  I  must  admit  that  NASA  is  an  entity  near  and  dear  to  the  interest
of my district. I remember the ebullience that our nation felt when Neil Armstrong
walked  on  the  Moon  in  1969.  Our  young  people  need  to  witness  similar  achieve-
ments that will drive them into advanced careers in science, engineering, and math,
and  I  truly  believe  that  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  will  be  one  giant  step  to-
wards that goal.

I am however concerned with such a focused approach because NASA has success-
fully  accomplished  a  broad  mission  including  aeronautics,  Earth  science,  and  addi-
tional space research programs that do not revolve around this Vision for Space Ex-
ploration. I must say I am cautious about NASA’s return-to-flight because of the in-
herent  risks  to  our  brave  astronauts.  As  we  eagerly  await  the  return-to-flight  mis-
sion,  I  am  seeking  the  assurance  that  NASA  has  done  everything  in  its  power  to
ensure the safety of its crews. The Vision for Space Exploration is a superior ambi-
tion,  however  we  cannot  afford  another  devastating  accident  that  leads  to  setbacks
and losses of life.

Now that you have had two months in your position as Administrator, I look for-
ward  to  hearing  your  vision  for  NASA.  More  specifically,  I  would  like  to  learn  how
you  intend  to  balance  and  restructure  NASA  in  a  way  that  continues  all  of  its  im-
portant  missions  and  accomplishes  an  aggressive  research  and  exploration  agenda
that makes the safety of our astronauts a top priority.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Mr.  Administrator,  as  both  Mr.  Gordon
and  I  noted  in  our  opening  statements,  many  fundamental  ques-
tions facing NASA remain to be answered. Let me go through a list
of  pending  items  that  we  reviewed  at  the  February  hearing  with
then Acting Administrator Gregory. For each of these, I would like
you  to  tell  me  and  the  Committee  when  we  will  get  the  answer  to
the question. You may have mentioned some of these in your testi-
mony, but I would like to go through the list, nonetheless, to create
a  single  place  in  the  record  we  can  all  go  back  to  to  measure  our
progress.

The  research—can  you  tell  me  when  you  are  going  to  have  the
research  agenda  for  the  International  Space  Station  and  its  pro-
posed final configuration?

Wait. Make a statement first.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  No,  sir.  I  wanted  to  take  your  questions.  You

were——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Are you sure? I——
Dr. GRIFFIN. No, that is fine, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. All right. Fine.
Can I repeat that? I will go through the list.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Please do.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  first  one,  you  have  got  that,  right?
The—when do you plan to have the research agenda for the Inter-
national  Space  Station  and  its  proposed  final  configuration?  I  will
do them one by one and let you respond.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Okay. Oh, I am sorry.
We  are  reworking  the  research  agenda  of  the  Space  Station,  as
has  been  pointed  out.  We  are  looking  at—the  question  is  difficult

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

23

to  answer,  because,  in  part,  it  ties  up  with  how  much  research  on
the Station do we want to do while we are trying to build and fin-
ish developing it.

As  was  pointed  out  in  your  earlier  statement,  or  someone’s  ear-
lier  statement,  we  must  retire  the  Shuttle  by  2010.  We  must,  as
soon  as  possible  thereafter,  deploy  the  CEV,  the  Crew  Exploration
Vehicle,  which  will  replace  the  Shuttle  and  which  will  be  our
means  of  ferrying  astronauts  back  and  forth.  And  so,  to  some  ex-
tent,  the  research  that  we  would  do  on  the  Space  Station,  if  we
were otherwise unconstrained, must take a back seat to getting the
necessary systems online to allow us to develop and utilize the Sta-
tion.

I  can’t  specifically  give  you  an  answer  as  to  when  we  will  have

the research agenda for the Station fully defined.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Can you hint?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes. Yes, sir, I can hint.
I  made  a  couple  of  notes  on  this.  We  are  trying  to  rebalance  the
portfolio.  The  high-priority  areas  are  going  to  be  space  radiation
health  and  shielding,  advanced  environmental  control  and  moni-
toring,  advanced  EVA  activities  and  the  support  of  those,  human
health  encounter  measures,  life  support  systems,  medical  care  for
exploration, and human factors, medical research with human sub-
jects  and  microgravity  validation  of  the  environmental  control  and
life support systems.

We  expect  to  refine  those  as  a  result  of  the  Shuttle  and  Station
Configuration  Options  Team  examination  that  is  underway  today.
Within the next few weeks, we will be briefing, discussing configu-
ration options within the Administration, and then, in short order,
with you here on Capitol Hill, with this committee and with others.
Our uncertainty today—so I—so in a briefer answer to your ques-

tion, I would say later this summer. Later this summer.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Later this summer.
Dr. GRIFFIN. The situation that we find ourselves in that results
in  this  lack  of  full  definition  is  that,  as  we  sit  here  today,  the  one
thing  we  are  certain  of  is  that  we  cannot  fly  28  Shuttle  flights  to
assemble the Station and still retire the Shuttle by 2010. There are
not  28  flights  available  in  our  manifesting  sequence,  if  we  wish  to
retire  by  2010.  Therefore,  what  we  are  looking  at  is  a  redefined
program  of  Shuttle  flights  that  we  can  execute  with  a  high  degree
of confidence over the next five years. And that necessarily results
in replanning the research agenda.

Chairman BOEHLERT. You know, I was so anxious to get to these
questions,  we  all  are,  that  I  neglected  to  give  you  the  opportunity
for an opening statement. We want to welcome you with open arms
before  this  committee  and  give  you  the  chance  to  share  with  us
some of your thoughts before we proceed with the questions.

So the Floor is yours, Mr. Administrator.

TRATOR,  NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  ADMINIS-
TRATION

the record this statement as well as the more—longer, more formal
statement.

I  do  want  to  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  appear  before  you.  As
both  you  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon  have  pointed  out,  I  have
been  here  many  times  before  as  a  private  citizen.  I  have  forged,  I
think,  excellent  working  relationships  with  this  committee,  and  I
certainly  hope  that  that  won’t  change  in  testifying  before  you  in  a
new capacity as NASA Administrator.

And  we  do  have  many  challenges  to  overcome.  We  need  to  work
closely  with  this  committee  and  the  entire  Congress  to  carry  out
the  President’s  vision  for  exploration  and  our  other  programs.  You
have  many—you  have  raised  many  questions.  I  have  made  signifi-
cant  changes  in  the  last  2c  months  that  I  and  my  staff  believe  are
necessary  to  get  us  on  the  right  track.  And  I  look  forward  to  an-
swering  as  many  of  the  questions  that  Ranking  Member  Gordon
and yourself have raised today as I possibly can.

So with that introduction, let me enter, if I might, this oral state-
ment into the record. Your staff and you can pursue it at your lei-
sure, and with your permission, then, we can move directly to your
questions, which I will try to answer as——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  without  objection,  so  ordered.  Your
entire statement will be made part of the permanent record for our
perusal, quite frankly, close examination.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Griffin follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
appear  today  to  discuss  NASA’s  plans  for  the  future  as  represented  in  the  Presi-
dent’s FY 2006 budget request for NASA.

On  January  14,  2004,  President  George  W.  Bush  announced  the  Vision  for  Space
Exploration.  The  President’s  directive  gave  NASA  clear  objectives  as  well  as  a  new
and historic focus. The fundamental goal of this directive for the Nation’s space ex-
ploration program is ‘‘. . .to advance U.S. scientific, security, and economic interests
through a robust space exploration program.’’ In issuing this directive, the President
committed the Nation to a journey of exploring the solar system and beyond, return-
ing  humans  to  the  Moon,  and  sending  robots  and  ultimately  humans  to  Mars  and
other  destinations.  He  challenged  us  to  establish  new  and  innovative  programs  to
enhance  our  understanding  of  the  planets,  to  ask  new  questions,  and  to  answer
questions  as  old  as  humankind.  NASA  embraced  this  directive  and  began  a  long-
term transformation to enable us to achieve this goal.

In June 2004, the President’s Commission on Implementation of the United States
Space  Exploration  Policy,  led  by  E.  C.  ‘‘Pete’’  Aldridge,  Jr.  (the  Aldridge  Commis-
sion),  reported  its  findings  and  recommendations  to  the  President.  The  Aldridge
Commission emphasized the crucial role that technological innovation, national and
international  partnerships,  and  organizational  transformation  must  play  if  we  are
to  implement  the  President’s  vision  for  an  affordable  and  sustainable  space  explo-
ration  program.  NASA  is  committed  to  making  the  necessary  transformation  to
achieve the Vision for Space Exploration.

On  December  21,  2004,  the  President  signed  a  new  national  policy  directive  that
establishes guidelines and implementation actions for United States space transpor-
tation programs and activities to ensure the Nation’s continued ability to access and
use  space  for  national  and  homeland  security,  and  civil,  scientific,  and  commercial
purposes. NASA will play a significant role in implementing this directive, fostering
and  enabling  the  development  of  space  transportation  capabilities  for  human  space
exploration  beyond  low-Earth  orbit  with  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV),  con-
sistent with the goals of the Vision for Space Exploration.

The  President  demonstrated  his  commitment  to  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
by making it a priority in his FY 2005 budget request, and Congress responded posi-
tively  by  providing  funding  for  NASA  at  the  level  requested  by  the  President.  The
President has reaffirmed his commitment to the Vision by again making it a priority

in  his  FY  2006  budget  request  in  a  very  challenging  budget  environment.  The
$16.46 billion requested for NASA reflects an increase of 2.4 percent over FY 2005.
While today’s hearing concerns the President’s FY 2006 budget request for NASA,
I  must  also  use  this  opportunity  to  update  the  Committee  regarding  the  difficult
choices that need to be made in executing NASA’s FY 2005 budget, and my guiding
philosophy in dealing with these challenges.

A  detailed  FY  2005  Operating  Plan  update  was  recently  provided  to  all  of  the
Committees  in  Congress  which  oversee  NASA.  With  this  FY  2005  Operating  Plan
update,  NASA  is  fully  funding—within  our  FY  2005  budget—the  $762  million  in-
crease  for  returning  the  Space  Shuttle  safely  to  flight,  consistent  with  the  rec-
ommendations  from  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  (CAIB),  over  $400
million  in  Congressionally-directed  items,  $291  million  for  Hubble  servicing,  and
over  $500  million  in  necessary  programmatic  cost  increases,  notably  to  cover  cost
growth  in  several  space  science  missions,  including  the  Mars  Reconnaissance  Or-
biter, scheduled to be launched this August, and the New Horizons mission to Pluto
set to launch in early January 2006.

Identifying  offsets  needed  to  fund  these  items  has  created  some  difficult  choices
for the Agency. Given a choice, I generally favor eliminating lower-priority programs
rather than reducing all programs in the face of budget difficulties, because this al-
lows for the more efficient execution of the programs which remain. Thus, we must
set clear priorities to remain within the budget which has been allocated.

Allow  me  to  be  as  clear  as  possible  on  what  the  impact  of  these  costs  means  to
other  programs.  The  Agency  has  adopted  a  ‘‘go-as-you-can-pay’’  approach  toward
space exploration. Several NASA missions and activities will need to be deferred or
accomplished  in  other  ways  in  order  to  ensure  adequate  funding  for  the  priorities
of the President and the Congress in FY 2005. NASA cannot do everything that we,
and our many stakeholders, would like to accomplish. Several missions will have to
be  delayed,  deferred,  or  canceled  in  order  to  pay  for  the  missions  where  the  prior-
ities  were  set  by  the  President  and  Congress.  We  have  tried  to  be  sensitive  to  the
priorities  of  the  affected  research  communities,  and  have  listened  carefully  to  their
input.  For  example,  we  seek  to  impart  a  new  balance  among  planetary  science,
Earth  science,  solar  physics,  and  astronomy  within  the  overall  science  program  by
revisiting  our  Mars  exploration  program  strategy  and  mission  sequence  and  the
schedule  for  advanced  space  telescopes  such  as  the  Space  Interferometry  Mission
(SIM) and Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF).
NASA Priorities

Over the past year, NASA has made great strides in implementing the Vision for

Space Exploration and meeting other national priorities:

• Shuttle  Return-to-Flight—We  are  making  final  preparations  for  the  Space

Shuttle return-to-flight planned for mid-July.

• International  Space  Station—The  ISS  began  its  fifth  year  of  continuous

human presence on-orbit.

• Exploring  Our  Solar  System  and  the  Universe—The  Mars  rovers,  Spirit  and
Opportunity, have exceeded all expectations and made unprecedented discov-
eries; the Cassini/Huygens mission is providing stunning views of Saturn and
Titan; the Genesis mission, despite its hard landing, has returned primordial
samples  from  space;  new  missions  have  been  launched  to  Mercury  and  to
comets; and amazing discoveries continue with Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer.
• Laying the Groundwork for the Future—We awarded initial contracts in prep-
aration  for  a  major  milestone  in  2008  with  the  mapping  of  the  Moon  in  un-
precedented detail by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).

• Aeronautics—We  are  continuing  to  execute  a  portfolio  of  focused,  results-ori-
ented  technology  demonstrations  of  next-generation  aircraft  along  with  avia-
tion safety, security, and airspace systems. NASA, with its industry partners,
recently  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of  significantly  reducing  the  sonic  boom
from supersonic aircraft, and, last November, NASA’s hypersonic X–43A dem-
onstrated  that  an  air-breathing  engine  can  fly  at  nearly  10  times  the  speed
of sound.

• Earth  Science—We  have  completed  deployment  of  the  Earth  Observing  Sys-
tem and are supporting investments in the Global Change Science and Tech-
nology Program and the next generation Earth observing satellites for numer-
ous  applications,  including  improved  weather  forecasts,  earthquake  pre-
diction, resource management, and other hazard warnings.

NASA’s Proposed FY 2006 Authorization Bill

26

On  June  17,  2005,  NASA  transmitted  its  proposed  FY  2006  Authorization  Bill  to
the  Congress.  I  look  forward  to  working  closely  with  the  House  Science  Committee
and Senate Commerce Committee this year to enact this important legislation.

Through  NASA’s  proposed  FY  2006  Authorization  Bill  we  are  requesting  a  set  of
critical  tools  and  authorities  to  implement  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  con-
sistent  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Aldridge  Commission.  The  provisions  re-
quested are an integral complement of critical tools and authorities that will better
equip  NASA  to  address  the  challenges  we  face  in  implementation  of  the  Vision  for
Space Exploration.

As  the  United  States  implements  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  the  Adminis-
tration recognizes the value of effective cooperation with Russia to further our space
exploration  goals.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  essential  that  we  appropriately  maintain
U.S.  nonproliferation  policy  and  objectives  in  our  relationship  with  Russia.  Such  a
balanced approach must include the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (INA), which
contains  certain  restrictions  that  complicate  cooperation  with  Russia  on  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  (ISS),  and  will  also  have  an  adverse  impact  on  cooperation
with  Russia  on  our  future  space  exploration  efforts  related  to  human  space  flight.
Over the last several months, NASA has been participating in an interagency co-
ordination process related to INA in an effort to develop a solution to this issue that
would  provide  NASA  with  needed  flexibility  while  still  meeting  our  nation’s  non-
proliferation objectives. The interagency group has proposed a legislative solution in
the  form  of  an  amendment  to  the  INA,  which  sustains  the  Act’s  nonproliferation
core,  while  allowing  for  continued  NASA–Russian  cooperation  on  the  ISS  and
human space flight endeavors.

It  is  expected  that  this  approach  will  be  delivered  to  Congress  in  the  very  near
future.  To  that  end,  the  Administration  looks  forward  to  working  with  Congress  to
ensure that the Vision for Space Exploration is able to succeed while remaining fully
consistent with broader U.S. national security and nonproliferation goals.

In  the  Authorization  bill,  we  are  also  requesting  authority  to  award  prizes
through  Centennial  Challenges.  With  this  authority  the  Agency  will  award  prizes
to  stimulate  innovation  in  basic,  advanced,  and  applied  research;  technology  devel-
opment; and, through prototype demonstrations that have the potential for applica-
tion for the aeronautics and space activities of NASA. Instead of soliciting proposals
for  a  contract  or  grant,  Centennial  Challenges  will  identify  a  challenge,  the  prize
amount  to  be  awarded  for  achieving  that  challenge,  and  a  set  of  rules  by  which
teams will compete for that prize. Centennial Challenges will help NASA meet tech-
nology challenges while encouraging creativity and innovation in the private sector,
particularly in exploration.

NASA  is  placing  a  new  emphasis  on  building  an  agile  workforce,  with  the  right
mix  of  permanent  civil  servants,  other-than-permanent  civil  servants,  and  contrac-
tors. As a result, we are seeking a set of critical workforce management tools needed
as  the  Agency  engages  in  a  major  transformation  and  restructures  itself  to  achieve
21st Century goals. Specifically, the Agency is seeking the authority to re-hire annu-
itants  without  a  salary  offset  to  accommodate  short-term  emergency  or  critical  pro-
gram  needs;  the  ability  to  offset  the  expense  of  short-term  health  care  coverage  for
employees  who  are  involuntarily  separated  from  the  Agency  and  request  extended
coverage (as currently authorized by law); provide incentives for permanent employ-
ees who voluntarily convert to a time-limited appointment to minimize the need for
other, less desirable workforce reshaping actions; and provide additional hiring flexi-
bilities  under  collaborative  research  activities  to  further  enhance  our  partnerships.
Furthermore, NASA seeks the ability to realign real property assets with Agency
missions by expanding the current enhanced-use lease authority beyond the current
two  center  pilot  projects,  and  allowing  NASA  to  retain  the  proceeds  from  the  sale
of real and personal property.

Lastly,  the  proposed  legislation  requests  intellectual  property,  financial  manage-

ment, and administrative improvements to support NASA’s mission.
Affordability and Sustainability

In  his  February  2nd  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  President  underscored  the
need  to  restrain  spending  in  order  to  sustain  our  economic  prosperity.  As  part  of
this  restraint,  it  is  important  that  total  discretionary  and  non-security  spending  be
held  to  levels  proposed  in  the  FY  2006  Budget.  The  budget  savings  and  reforms  in
the  Budget  are  important  components  of  achieving  the  President’s  goal  of  cutting
the  budget  deficit  in  half  by  2009,  and  we  urge  the  Congress  to  support  these  re-
forms. The FY 2006 Budget includes more than 150 reductions, reforms, and termi-
nations  in  non-defense  discretionary  programs,  of  which  three  affect  NASA  pro-
grams. The Agency wants to work with the Congress to achieve these savings.

To  achieve  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  NASA  is  proceeding,  as  directed  by
the  President,  to  plan  and  implement  a  sustainable  and  affordable,  integrated
robotic  and  human  exploration  program,  structured  with  measurable  milestones,
and executed on the basis of available resources, accumulated experience, and tech-
nology readiness. Last year, we provided a long-range roadmap through 2020 to out-
line this program:

• The  Space  Shuttle  will  be  retired  by  2010.  Prior  to  its  retirement,  it  will  be
utilized  primarily  for  the  assembly  of  the  ISS.  Our  top  priority  will  be  to
make each flight safer than the last one.
• The new CEV and its associated launch system will transport crews on explo-
ration  missions,  and  will  also  be  capable  of  ferrying  astronauts  to  and  from
the Space Station. The CEV will be developed in the latter part of this decade
and  deployed  operationally  as  soon  as  possible.  The  CEV  will  conduct  mis-
sions  in  Earth  orbit,  including  missions  to  the  ISS,  but  its  primary  mission
will be to support exploration of the Moon and other destinations.
• Robotic  missions  will  continue  to  increase  our  understanding  of  our  home
planet  and  will  continue  the  exploration  of  the  solar  system,  traveling  to  the
Moon and Mars in anticipation of later human visits, as well as to other des-
tinations  such  as  Mercury,  Saturn,  Pluto,  asteroids,  and  comets.  Observ-
atories  will  be  deployed  to  search  for  Earth-like  planets  and  habitable  envi-
ronments around distant stars, and to explore the universe to understand its
origin,  structure,  evolution,  and  destiny.  The  President’s  Budget  requests  in-
creased  funding  for  these  areas  over  the  coming  years,  with  Science  invest-
ments growing from 33 percent to 38 percent of the Agency’s total budget.
• Human explorers will return to the Moon, possibly as early as 2015—with the
CEV as the first core element of a new exploration architecture. Major devel-
opment  of  the  other  elements  in  the  exploration  architecture  will  commence
later this decade and will accelerate upon the retirement of the Space Shuttle.
These exploration elements will include launch vehicles, in-space transfer sys-
tems,  lunar  landers,  and  surface  habitation  systems.  Critical  research  and
technology  investment  decisions  will  be  guided  by  the  development  require-
ments of these elements.

These  human  and  robotic  explorers  will  enable  our  exploration  and  scientific
plans.  A  recent  report  released  on  February  3,  2005,  by  the  National  Research
Council,  entitled  Science  in  NASA’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  states,  ‘‘Explo-
ration  done  properly  is  a  form  of  science.  Both  robotic  spacecraft  and  human  space
flight should be used to fulfill scientific roles in NASA’s mission to explore.’’ To that
end, NASA has initiated an Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), which
will  provide  the  analytical  support  for  a  number  of  key  near-term  decisions  for
NASA,  the  White  House,  and  Congress.  The  ESAS  is  a  90-day  study  that  is  exam-
ining many of the larger questions associated with the Vision for Space Exploration.
Some  of  the  topics  the  ESAS  is  reviewing  include  the  requirements  for  returning
to  the  Moon  and  extending  human  exploration  to  Mars,  as  well  as  possibilities  for
accelerating  the  development  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV).  This  team  is
expected  to  complete  its  work  in  July  and  we  will  keep  Congressional  Committees
informed as this study effort progresses.

This study effort will focus on four primary areas:

launch systems to support the lunar and Mars exploration programs.

• Complete  assessment  of  the  top-level  CEV  requirements  and  plans  to  enable
the  CEV  to  provide  crew  transport  to  the  ISS  and  to  accelerate  the  develop-
ment of the CEV and crew launch system.
• Definition  of  top-level  requirements  and  configurations  for  crew  and  cargo
• Development  of  a  reference  lunar  exploration  architecture  concept  to  support
• Identification of key technologies required to enable and significantly enhance
these  reference  exploration  systems,  and  a  re-prioritization  of  near-term  and
far-term technology investments.

sustained human and robotic Lunar exploration operations.

NASA is also currently examining alternative configurations for the Space Station
that meet the goals of the Vision and the needs of our international partners, while
maintaining  safety  as  our  highest  priority.  In  May  2005,  we  initiated  the  Shuttle/
Station  Configuration  Options  Team  (SSCOT).  This  team  is  conducting  a  60-day
study  of  the  configuration  options  for  the  ISS  and  assessing  the  related  number  of
flights  needed  by  the  Space  Shuttle  before  it  retires  no  later  than  the  year  2010.
The  scope  of  the  Shuttle/Station  Configuration  Options  Team  study  spans  ISS  as-

sembly, operations, and use and considers such factors as international partner com-
mitments,  research  utilization,  cost,  and  ISS  sustainability.  This  team  is  expected
to  complete  its  work  in  June,  with  those  results  integrated  into  the  ongoing  Explo-
ration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS).
NASA Priorities in the FY 2006 Budget Request

The President’s FY 2006 budget request for NASA reaffirms the funding strategy
outlined  above.  NASA’s  FY  2006  request  endeavors  to  provide  a  balanced  portfolio
of  programs  to  meet  the  needs  of  our  national  priorities  in  aeronautics  and  civil
space. It maintains focus on key priorities, milestones, and schedules for the Vision
introduced in the FY 2005 budget.

To  support  the  Administration’s  goal  of  reducing  the  deficit,  NASA’s  budget  was
reduced  $0.5  billion  in  FY  2006  below  the  level  planned  in  the  2005  budget  for  FY
2006.  In  addition,  returning  the  Shuttle  safely  to  flight  will  cost  $0.4  billion  more
in  FY  2006  than  previously  estimated.  To  address  these  and  other  items,  we  pro-
posed  a  budget  that  provided  $0.4  billion  (11  percent)  less  for  Exploration  Systems
than  previously  planned  for,  $0.3  billion  (five  percent)  less  in  Science,  $0.1  billion
(11 percent) less in Aeronautics, and $0.2 billion (four percent) more in Space Oper-
ations. These changes were not easy, but in the end, we made the decisions to pro-
tect the priorities outlined above.
Science

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $5.5  billion  for  the  Science  Mission  Directorate
will  support  55  missions  in  orbit,  26  in  development,  and  34  in  design  phase.  By
2010, the Science budget will increase by 23 percent over current levels.

The  FY  2006  budget  includes  $858  million  for  Mars  and  Lunar  robotic  explo-
ration.  The  Mars  rovers,  Spirit  and  Opportunity,  have  far  exceeded  all  goals  with
their unprecedented discoveries and longevity. Last year, the rovers found definitive
evidence of an ancient body of water on the Red Planet, and they continue to gather
data more than a year after their successful landing. We recently awarded contracts
for six instruments to be flown on the 2008 LRO that promises unprecedented map-
ping  of  the  Moon’s  surface.  The  2008  LRO  will  be  the  first  step  in  revolutionizing
our understanding of the Moon, in much the same way that our Mars missions have
transformed our understanding of Mars. As mentioned earlier, to simplify the man-
agement  chain-of-command  among  mission  directorates,  our  FY  2005  Operating
Plan  update  transfers  management  responsibility  for  the  Lunar  Exploration  pro-
gram, including LRO, to the ESMD. This will help to maximize the exploration and
science benefits of this important program.

The  budget  also  includes  $218  million  to  maintain  competitive  efforts  for  the  Ex-
plorer Program, $56 million for the Beyond Einstein program to study the universe,
$234 million for studying the Sun in the Living With a Star program, and $136 mil-
lion for competitive opportunities in the Earth System Science Pathfinder program.
With  our  international  partners,  we  also  continue  to  add  to  the  constellation  of
Earth-observing  satellites  that  monitor  our  planet  while  extending  our  reach  and
presence  further  into  the  solar  system.  NASA  launched  Aura  to  look  back  at  Earth
and give us a better picture of our atmosphere and changing climate, and the entire
Earth  Observing  System  continues  to  return  trillions  of  bytes  of  information  about
our dynamic Earth. In the future, NASA plans to develop a ‘‘sensor-web’’ to provide
timely,  on-demand  data  and  analysis  to  users  who  can  enable  practical  benefits  for
scientific research, national policy-making, economic growth, natural hazard mitiga-
tion, and the exploration of other planets in this solar system and beyond.

NASA  will  continue  to  expand  its  exploration  reach  with  an  armada  of  existing
and  new  space  observatories  operating  in  many  different  wavelengths  and  looking
at  different  parts  of  our  exotic  universe.  The  three  ‘‘Great  Observatories’’—Hubble,
Spitzer,  and  Chandra—will  continue  to  bring  wondrous  images  to  our  eyes  and  ex-
citing new scientific discoveries. Missions such as Kepler will provide a new under-
standing and knowledge of the planets orbiting stars far from our solar system.

This  budget  also  includes  $372  million  to  continue  developing  the  James  Webb
Space  Telescope  for  a  2011  launch  and  provides  $93  million  in  development  funds
for  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.  This  investment  in  the  Hubble,  together  with  the
synergistic use of the other two Great Observatories, and combined with the greatly
increased  capability  of  ground-based  assets  and  the  emergent  science  of  optical
interferometry, will ensure many years of new scientific discoveries.

NASA’s  decision  in  January  2004  not  to  service  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  was
a very difficult one, given the Hubble’s record of spectacular successes. That decision
was  made  at  a  time  when  significant  uncertainty  remained  regarding  the  technical
solutions  and  risks  associated  with  return-to-flight.  After  the  two  successful  Space
Shuttle  flights  needed  to  achieve  our  return-to-flight  objectives,  NASA  will  have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

29

learned  a  great  deal  more  regarding  the  risks  and  operations  of  the  vehicle  than
was  known  when  the  previous  decision  was  made.  I  am  committed  to  reassessing
this  earlier  decision  after  return-to-flight,  based  on  the  relative  risks  to  the  Space
Shuttle  as  well  as  the  costs  and  benefits  to  our  nation’s  astronomy  program.  As  a
result,  we  are  continuing  our  efforts  to  preserve  the  option  for  a  Shuttle  servicing
mission  for  Hubble.  Consistent  with  this  ongoing  activity,  NASA’s  FY  2005  Oper-
ating Plan update has fully funded the $291 million identified in the Conference Re-
port  accompanying  the  FY  2005  Consolidated  Appropriations  bill  and  has  consoli-
dated the funding and management responsibility within the Science Mission Direc-
torate. NASA will use the balance of the FY 2005 funds to maintain options for HST
servicing  and  de-orbit.  NASA  has  also  begun  the  analysis  of  how  a  de-orbit  module
for  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  could  be  added  to  the  manifest  of  such  a  Space
Shuttle servicing mission. I will make a decision regarding a Shuttle servicing mis-
sion  for  Hubble  following  the  success  of  the  first  two  Return-to-Flight  missions.  In
the interim, the Agency will keep all stakeholders apprised as this work progresses.
NASA  remains  committed  to  a  world-class,  affordable  program  of  space-based  as-
tronomy.
Preparing for Exploration

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $3.2  billion  for  the  ESMD  includes  $753  million
for  continuing  development  of  the  CEV,  the  vehicle  that  will  serve  as  the  core  ele-
ment  for  future  exploration  beyond  Earth  orbit.  The  CEV  promises  safer  travel  for
astronauts into space, continuing U.S. human access to space after retirement of the
Shuttle. The CEV will first conduct missions in Earth orbit, but its primary mission
will be to support exploration of the Moon and other destinations. Our earlier plans
called for operational deployment of the CEV not later than 2014. However, we are
now seeking programmatic alternatives to allow development of the CEV to be com-
pleted  as  soon  as  possible.  Acceleration  of  the  CEV  program  will  be  accomplished
by  down-selecting  to  a  single  contractor  sooner  than  originally  planned,  and  by  de-
ferring  other  elements  of  the  Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  plan
not required for the CEV or for the early phases of human return to the Moon.

The  first  CEV  missions  to  Earth  orbit  will  include  docking  with  the  ISS.  NASA’s
Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and  ac-
quiring both crew and cargo services to support the International Space Station, and
funds  have  been  transferred  to  that  Directorate.  We  plan  to  leverage  our  nation’s
commercial  space  industry  to  meet  NASA’s  needs  for  ISS  cargo  logistics  and  poten-
tially crew support.

Going forward, the Agency will need a launch system for the CEV, one which does
not at present exist. Two possibilities exist by which we might obtain such a vehicle.
The first is to develop a launch system derived from Shuttle components, specifically
the  SRB  with  a  new  upper  stage.  The  second  option  is  to  upgrade  the  proposed
heavy-lift  versions  of  EELV  with  a  new  upper  stage.  As  NASA  Administrator,  I
must  be  a  responsible  steward  of  our  funds,  and  a  key  aspect  of  the  Agency’s  anal-
ysis  of  alternatives  will  be  to  capitalize  on  existing  technical  and  workforce  assets
in a cost-effective and efficient way. NASA’s goal is to develop a CEV capable of op-
erating safely soon after the retirement of the Space Shuttle.

The FY 2006 budget request included $919 million (a 27 percent increase) for Ex-
ploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  (ESR&T)  that  will  enable  designs  for
sustainable  exploration;  though,  as  mentioned,  elements  of  that  program  will  now
be deferred to accelerated the CEV. Other ESR&T elements include $34 million for
a  revamped  technology  transfer  program  and  $34  million  for  the  Centennial  Chal-
lenges prize program. The Agency continues to seek the support of the Congress for
authorization to enable larger prize awards.

This  budget  also  includes  $320  million  for  a  restructured  Prometheus  Nuclear
Systems and Technology Theme for space-qualified nuclear systems. The technology
and  capabilities  being  developed  by  the  Prometheus  Nuclear  Systems  and  Tech-
nology Theme are critical for enabling the power and propulsion needs of the Vision
for  Space  Exploration.  As  part  of  the  Agency’s  effort  to  define  an  Exploration  Sys-
tems  Architecture,  NASA  will  examine  alternative  nuclear  systems,  including  sur-
face  nuclear  power,  nuclear  thermal,  and  nuclear  electric  systems.  NASA  will  re-
structure  Prometheus  for  space-qualified  nuclear  systems  to  support  human  and
robotic missions with clear priorities focused on near-term needs. We expect to make
program  decisions  to  focus  our  nuclear  technology  efforts  on  our  highest  priorities
for near-term applications as part of the Exploration Architecture study, to be com-
pleted  this  summer.  In  addition,  the  FY  2006  budget  request  provides  $806  million
for Human Systems Research and Technology, which has been restructured so that
its  programs  are  now  linked  directly  to  exploration  requirements  for  human  mis-
sions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

Aeronautics Research

30

NASA’s FY 2006 request for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is $852
million,  a  significant  portion  of  the  government’s  overall  investment  in  aeronautics
research.  To  make  the  most  of  this  investment,  NASA’s  technical  expertise  and  fa-
cilities  for  aeronautics  research  are  becoming  more  focused  and  results-oriented.
NASA’s current aeronautics research is focused on enhancing the public good. NASA
is also working to maintain a strong basic aeronautics research program and to es-
tablish  a  series  of  far-reaching  objectives,  each  of  which,  if  enabled,  could  signifi-
cantly  transform  civil  aeronautics.  The  results  from  the  basic  research,  technology
development,  and  demonstrations  achieved  by  NASA’s  Aeronautics  efforts  will  be
transitioned for use by both Government and industry. The President’s FY 2006 re-
quest  increased  the  vital  research  of  the  Aeronautics  program  in  Aviation  Safety
and Security and in Airspace Systems. These two priority programs are fully funded
to ensure timely results critical to meeting national goals. NASA works closely and
constructively  with  other  Executive  Branch  agencies  to  enhance  our  nation’s  aero-
nautics  capability.  In  this  vein,  NASA,  along  with  the  Departments  of  Defense,
Homeland  Security,  Commerce,  and  Transportation,  is  a  principal  member  of  the
interagency  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO),  which  was  chartered
by the Century of Aviation Revitalization Act to oversee research and technology ef-
forts  for  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System.  NASA  is  working  closely
with industry consortia and other government agencies to develop advanced aircraft
demonstrations,  such  as  those  that  would  expand  the  capabilities  of  high-altitude,
long-endurance, unmanned aerial vehicles, which could have numerous commercial,
scientific, and homeland security applications.

At this time, NASA is also working with other U.S. Government departments and
agencies  and  industry  to  assess  its  facilities  for  aeronautics  research.  NASA  will
need  to  consider  the  possibility  of  closing  some  under-utilized  aeronautics  facilities,
while modernizing some others to become state-of-the-art facilities.

As we move forward, a broader national dialog on aeronautics R&D goals may be
appropriate as we enter the second century of aviation. These discussions should in-
clude  a  range  of  stakeholders  and  customers,  including  the  Congress.  This  process
could lead to a national consensus for aeronautics R&D goals.
Education

NASA’s FY 2006 budget request includes $167 million for the Office of Education
to support programs in science, technology, engineering, and math education. NASA
will  establish  clear  goals,  metrics,  and  monitoring  capabilities  for  its  education  ini-
tiatives  in  the  coming  months  to  ensure  that  these  funds  will  achieve  the  greatest
benefit.
Space Shuttle and International Space Station

The  FY  2006  budget  request  of  $6.8  billion  for  the  Space  Operations  Mission  Di-
rectorate (SOMD) reflects the first step in the Vision for Space Exploration: return-
ing the Space Shuttle safely to flight and resuming flight operations. Going forward,
all  SOMD  expenditures  will  be  consistent  with  the  retirement  of  the  Space  Shuttle
by 2010, while maintaining operational safety of flight throughout the program. The
FY 2006 budget includes $4.5 billion for the Space Shuttle program. The budget also
provides $1.9 billion for the ISS. NASA currently is examining configurations for the
Space  Station  that  meet  the  goals  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  and  needs  of
our international partners, while requiring as few Shuttle flights as possible to com-
plete assembly.

A key element in the future of the ISS program is the purchase of alternate cargo
transportation  services  to  supplement  the  Space  Shuttle,  and  the  development  of
new crew transportation capabilities to replace Shuttle when it retires. Because the
ESMD  has  the  mission  to  develop  and  acquire  such  crew  and  cargo  capabilities  for
the ISS and beyond, I have transferred management responsibility for the activities
and budget of ISS Cargo/Crew Services to ESMD from SOMD, as stated in the May
update to NASA’s FY 2005 Operating Plan. The budget request before the Congress
provides $160 million for these services in 2006.

As  a  top  Return-to-Flight  (RTF)  priority,  NASA  has  made  dozens  of  changes  to
the  External  Tank  (ET)  design  to  reduce  both  foam  and  ice  debris  from  shedding
during  ascent.  These  changes  include  an  improved  bipod  design  that  now  excludes
using  foam  and  a  new  design  for  the  area  around  the  liquid  oxygen  feed  line  bel-
lows.  Each  of  these  changes  incorporates  electric  heaters  to  eliminate  an  unaccept-
able  debris  risk  to  the  Orbiter  caused  by  ice  buildup  on  the  ET.  The  new  designs
are  presently  installed  on  the  ET  for  Discovery’s  flight  (STS–114)  and  will  be  in-
cluded on all those to be used in the future.

We have also made more than 100 major modifications and upgrades to Discovery
and  its  supporting  systems,  including  new  cabling  and  wiring  for  sensors  placed  in
the  wing  leading  edge  of  each  wing,  a  digital  camera  for  monitoring  any  debris  im-
pacting the underside of the Orbiter, and a boom extension for the Shuttle’s robotic
arm that will enable us to inspect nearly all the outside areas of the Orbiter’s Ther-
mal  Protection  System  after  achieving  orbit.  Additionally,  technicians  at  KSC  have
installed  the  redesigned  Forward  Reaction  Control  System  Carrier  Panels  and  the
Reinforced  Carbon-Carbon  Nose  Cap.  Technicians  have  also  installed  88  new  sen-
sors  in  the  leading  edge  of  each  wing,  of  which  66  will  measure  acceleration  and
impact  data  and  22  will  measure  temperature  profiles  during  Discovery’s  ascent  to
orbit. These data will be down-linked to the ground to be used as a cue for pointing
to  areas  in  the  thermal  protection  system  needing  further  inspection  by  the  boom
mounted  sensor  system.  These  are  just  several  of  the  extensive  changes  we  have
made  to  the  hardware  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  debris  shedding  from  the  External
Tank. Discovery and its propulsion elements are now at the launch pad undergoing
the final tests and checks required prior to launch, currently scheduled to occur not
earlier than July 13, 2005.
Transforming NASA

The  CAIB  was  clear  in  its  assessment  that  the  lack  of  open  communication  on
technical  and  programmatic  matters  was  as  much  a  cause  of  the  loss  of  Columbia
as  the  shedding  of  the  foam.  We  have  understood  and  embraced  this  assessment,
and  are  absolutely  and  completely  committed  to  creating  an  environment  of  open-
ness  and  free-flowing  communication  by  continuing  to  assess  our  leadership  prac-
tices.

For  the  last  three  decades,  NASA  and  the  Nation’s  human  space  flight  program
have  been  focused  on  the  development  and  operation  of  the  Space  Shuttle  and  the
Space Station. In its final report, the CAIB was very forthright in its judgment that
these goals are too limited to justify the expense, difficulty, and danger inherent in
human  space  flight,  given  the  limitations  of  today’s  technology.  The  CAIB  was
equally  forthright  in  calling  for  a  national  consensus  in  the  establishment  of  a  pro-
gram  having  broader  strategic  goals.  The  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  proposed  by
the  President  is  that  program,  and  NASA  has  embraced  this  new  direction.  But  to
effect these changes, NASA must engage in a major transformation—taking the ca-
pabilities  we  have  throughout  the  Agency  and  restructuring  them  to  achieve  these
21st Century goals. This is an enormous challenge, but we have begun to transform
our  entire  organization  to  foster  these  changes  and  to  enhance  a  positive,  mission-
driven culture.

• Embracing  Competition—NASA  is  embracing  competition  as  a  way  to  elicit
the  best  from  NASA’s  Centers,  industry,  and  academia.  The  Agency  is  using
competitive processes to encourage more cost-effective, innovative solutions to
the scientific and technical challenges presented by the Vision. Over the past
year,  competitive  selections  in  exploration  have  demonstrated  increased  col-
laboration  between  NASA’s  Centers  and  industry  and  academia.  The  engine
of  competition  is  the  primary  force  behind  the  American  economy,  the  great-
est the world has ever known, and we plan to make greater use of this engine
than  has  been  the  case  at  NASA  in  the  past.  NASA  plans  to  pursue  appro-
priate  partnerships  with  the  entrepreneurial  and  commercial  space  sector  to
the maximum practical extent.
• The Role of the Centers—While competitive processes are crucial to maintain-
ing  NASA  at  the  ‘‘cutting  edge’’  of  science  and  technology,  we  must  acknowl-
edge that the NASA Centers and other federal research and development lab-
oratories  exist,  and  have  existed  for  decades,  precisely  because  industrial
competition  does  not  serve  to  accomplish  all  of  our  national  goals.  In  order
to  accomplish  the  national  goals  set  forth  by  the  President  and  Congress,
NASA  must  set  realistic  priorities  within  limited  resources.  NASA  Centers
will have an important role in definition of the architecture and requirements
for  exploration  beyond  low-Earth  orbit,  and  for  the  systems  engineering  and
integration  functions  used  in  building  the  systems  of  that  architecture.  We
will  continue  to  assess  the  skill-mix  that  we  require,  the  number  of  people
we  require,  their  location,  and  how  we  are  organizing  ourselves  to  fulfill  our
obligations  to  the  President  and  Congress.  To  begin  to  create  some  of  the
workforce  flexibility  necessary  for  the  future,  NASA  has  offered  voluntary
separation  incentives  (buyouts)  to  employees  in  positions  identified  with  ex-
cess  competencies.  To  the  extent  that  NASA’s  workforce  needs  revitalization,
NASA is proposing legislative initiatives to the Congress as part of the Agen-
cy’s  draft  FY  2006  Authorization  Bill.  Congress’s  enactment  of  the  NASA

32

Flexibility  Act  of  2004  is  also  helping  the  Agency  toward  that  end,  and  addi-
tional authorities will provide even more aid in managing the Agency’s work-
force.

• Improved Decision-making—NASA recently transformed its organizational re-
porting in order to provide more integrated decision-making. NASA field Cen-
ter  Directors  now  report  directly  to  the  Administrator,  and  I  am  drafting  a
position  description  for  a  new  Associate  Administrator  who  will  manage  the
internal  activities  of  the  Agency.  The  Office  of  Education  reports  directly  to
the Director of Strategic Communications, who is also in charge of Public Af-
fairs,  External  Relations,  and  Legislative  Affairs,  in  order  to  provide  a  more
integrated picture of what NASA is doing and can do for its stakeholders and
public. NASA’s new Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation has been cre-
ated in order to provide analyses and assessments for strategic planning and
budgeting  decisions,  independent  cost  estimates,  evaluation  of  projects  at
major  milestones,  and  feedback  from  the  Centers  on  their  capabilities  and
work  climate.  This  is  to  ensure  that  the  acquisition  strategies,  if  done  as
planned,  are  executable,  have  exit  and  entrance  criteria,  contain  clear  ap-
proval milestones, and involve independent reviews.

• Improving  Financial  Management—For  the  past  two  years,  NASA  has  re-
ceived  a  disclaimer  of  audit  opinion  on  its  annual  financial  statements  due
largely  to  two  issues—financial  system  conversion,  and  accounting  for  prop-
erty,  plant  and  equipment,  and  materials  and  supplies.  In  FY  2003,  NASA
converted  the  10  separate  NASA  Center  accounting  systems  and  the  associ-
ated  120  subsidiary  systems,  along  with  over  12  years  of  historical  financial
data,  into  a  single  integrated  agency-wide  core  accounting  system.  Problems
associated with this conversion have been greater than expected and are tak-
ing longer than expected to correct. I regard improvement of NASA’s financial
management as one of my priorities.

• Capital  Asset  Management—The  management  of  NASA’s  capital  assets,  val-
ued  at  $37.6  billion  (83  percent  of  NASA’s  assets  on  the  balance  sheet),  is  a
significant challenge for the Agency. Historically, the management systems to
provide  proper  valuation  and  tracking  of  assets  have  not  been  sufficient  to
meet the rigors of review without significant compensating controls and man-
ual effort. Another challenge we are facing is that the costs of many facilities
that  could  be  deemed  ‘‘national  assets’’  were  being  born  as  direct  charges  to
our  projects  causing  an  unequal  competitive  base  among  our  field  centers.
Through the Integrated Asset Management (IAM) project we are steadily cre-
ating the proper controls to provide tracking and valuation needed to account
for  the  many  types  of  assets  that  exist  within  NASA.  Realistically,  the  suc-
cessful  completion  of  the  IAM  project  will  take  time.  We  are  validating  the
requirements  for  asset  management  methods  to  ensure  they  comply  with
audit requirements while we simultaneously update existing tracking systems
to modern platforms. For our ‘‘national assets’’ we plan to create a new fund-
ing structure aimed at ensuring the Centers have a chance to compete on an
equal footing. Placing the national asset funding in a separate, carefully man-
aged  account  will  help  create  a  level  playing  field  and  encourage  broad  scale
use. A great deal of attention is being placed on asset management to ensure
that  the  new  methods  and  systems  we  devise  provide  a  robust  and  enduring
solution  to  the  challenges  the  Agency  has  faced  in  resolving  this  significant
issue.

The Nation’s Future in Exploration and Discovery

The  aftermath  of  the  tragic  loss  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  on  February  1,
2003,  brought  us  to  a  watershed  moment  in  the  American  civil  space  program.
Choices had to be made. The President has put forth a choice, a strategic vision for
the  space  program.  That  vision  has  been  enunciated  with  exceptional  clarity,  and
has  been  subjected  to  considerable  public  debate  for  over  a  year.  While  differences
of opinion exist, the President’s proposal has attained broad strategic acceptance. As
a  nation,  we  can  clearly  afford  well-executed  vigorous  programs  in  robotic  and
human space exploration, Earth science, and aeronautics research.

For  America  to  continue  to  be  preeminent  among  nations,  it  is  necessary  for  us
to be the preeminent space-faring nation. It is equally true that great nations need
allies  and  partners  in  this  journey.  That  is  what  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
is about.

As President George W. Bush said, ‘‘We choose to explore space because doing so

improves our lives and lifts our national spirit. So let us continue the journey.’’

DISCUSSION

TIMETABLE FOR INFORMATION

Chairman BOEHLERT. Let me continue on with my series of ques-

tions on when.

When  do  you  expect  that  we  will  have  some  report  on  the  num-
ber of flights the Space Shuttle will make before its retirement, the
purpose  of  those  flights,  and  the  expected  date  of  the  final  flight?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Again, sir, later this summer.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Later  this  summer  we  are  going  to  be  in

the August recess, so——

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  No.  Okay,  we  will  be  discussing—we  are  exam-
ining—as I sit here, a team of bright and dedicated engineers with
substantial  experience  in  the  business  and  on  Space  Station,  in
particular,  are  looking  at  all  of  the  available  options  by  which  we
might  complete  the  assembly  of  the  Space  Station  consistent  with
our  obligations  to  our  partners  and  our  research  agenda  while  re-
maining  within  the  requirement  to  retire  the  Shuttle  by  2010.  I
just  mentioned  that  there  will  not  be  available  28  flights,  and  so
we  must  work  with  less,  and  we  must  make  some  determination
as  to  what  amount  of  work  is  left  over  for  the  new  system  to  com-
plete.

We  will  be—we  are  close  to  the  end  of  that  exercise.  During  the
month  of  July,  we  will  be  discussing  those  alternatives  within  the
Administration, and as soon as we can do so, with your committee
and other Members of Congress.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  is  it  fair  to  say  the  September  time

frame would be a——

Dr. GRIFFIN. Absolutely not later than that, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. All right. Thank you very much.
And when might we have a description of the means, other than
the  Space  Shuttle,  that  might  be  used  to  ferry  crew  and  cargo  to
the International Space Station?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Again,  in  that  same  time  frame,  because  that  de-
pends  upon  the  results  of  a  parallel  study  on  exploration  systems
architecture, and I think you know that the President has required
that the so-called Crew Exploration Vehicle, which will provide the
fundamental  building  block  for  returning  astronauts  to  the  Moon,
must  also  be  capable  of  ferrying  astronauts  to  and  from  the  Space
Station. And so again, later this summer——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  That  same  time  frame  for  a  description  of

the launch vehicle for a CEV?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Absolutely, yes, sir.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  All  right.  And  now  this  one  is  a  sticky
wicket,  but  the  plan  for  the  operation  of  the  International  Space
Station  in  the  event  that  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  is
not amended.

Dr. GRIFFIN. That will take longer. If—we are in—for the Admin-
istration,  we  are  planning  to  seek  recommendations  for  that  act  to
allow  us  to  utilize  the  Station  together  with  our  Russian  partners.
If that act is not amended, then, at present, the only plan we really
have for utilizing the Space Station would be while the Space Shut-

35

tle  is  docked  at  the  Station.  At  times  other  than  that,  after  2006,
the United States would not be able to keep astronauts——

Chairman BOEHLERT. April 2006 you are saying?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  April  2006.  That  is  correct,  sir.  So  if  the  act  is  not
amended  and  NASA  would  not  be  able  to  have  U.S.  astronauts  on
board the Station, other than when the Shuttle is there.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  the  Shuttle  can  be  there  a  couple  of

weeks?

Dr. GRIFFIN. A couple of weeks.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  All  right.  A  description  of  any  heavy-lift
vehicle the Administration intends to develop, the intended uses of
that  vehicle,  and  whether  the  decision  to  develop  that  vehicle  has
undergone, or is undergoing, an interagency review.

Dr. GRIFFIN. All of the architecture that we intend to put forward
this summer will undergo interagency review. That is an unequivo-
cal statement. For heavy-lift vehicles capable of returning us to the
Moon,  I  have  made  no  secret  of  the  fact  that  I  believe  a  Shuttle-
derived  architecture  wherein  we  retire  the  orbiter  and  utilize  the
remaining  elements  of  the  Shuttle  structure,  the  engines,  the
tanks,  the  rocket  boosters,  will  provide  us  a  100  metric  ton  class
payload  capability.  And  the—but  from  where  we  are  today,  that  is
the shortest path to such a capability.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Of  the  intended  purpose  of  lunar  missions

and the architecture for those missions?

Dr. GRIFFIN. And sir, later this summer, certainly not later than
September.  That  is  a  study  that  is  ongoing.  And  I  realize—I  fully
respect  Mr.  Gordon’s  remarks,  and  yours,  that  it  has  been  now  al-
most  18  months  since  the  President’s  announcement  of  the  vision
for exploration and that it might well be said that we owe you, and
have  owed  you  for  some  time,  those  plans  and  those  architectures.
I do take responsibility for that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, it is an agency in transition. We un-

derstand that.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  It  is  in  transition,  and  we  do  not  believe  that  the
problem  needs  to  be  as  complicated  as  some  have  said,  and  we
are—we  have  been  working  since  I  arrived,  and  we  are  working
today in order to be able to provide you with those top-level plans,
architectures, approaches, and budgets later this summer.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, one of your great skills is your ability
to  take  complicated  matters  and  provide  some  simplification,  and
we are looking forward to that.

How about the project goals for Project Prometheus?
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  have—if  I  have  an  ability  to  simplify  things,  it  is
because  I  must  to  remain  within  my  own  limitations,  but  thank
you.

Project Prometheus is extremely important. The utilization of nu-
clear  power  in  space  for  electric  power  and  propulsion  has  no
stronger  advocates  than  I,  and  I  know  that  this  committee  knows
that,  because  I  have  said  that  in  prior  testimony.  However,  in  a
world  of  limited  resources,  as  I  looked  at  our  program  going  for-
ward,  I  could  not  justify  placing  as  the  first  goal  of  Project  Pro-
metheus,  the  development  of  a  nuclear  electric  propulsion  system
to send a scientific mission to Europa. There are—that mission was
at $11 billion and counting for cost estimates before we got off the

36

drawing  board,  and  I,  in  the  face  of  competing  priorities,  simply
could  not  endorse  that.  Moreover,  the  nearest  term  need  that  we
have  for  nuclear  capability  in  space  will  be  surface  power  on  the
Moon in the middle or toward the end of the next decade.

So  to  the  extent  that  we  wish  to  devote  resources  to  exploring
Europa,  and  I  do,  and  we  will  be  submitting  such  a  program,  I
chose  not  to  link  the  exploration  of  Europa  with  the  development
of nuclear electric propulsion to do so. And to the extent that I be-
lieve  in  the  importance  of  nuclear  power  and  propulsion  in  space,
and  I  do,  I  have  chosen  to  devote  our  early  resources  to  the  devel-
opment of lunar power—sorry, surface power for lunar missions.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  me,  before  turning  to  Mr.  Gordon,
whose indulgence I appreciate, but these are really consensus ques-
tions.

Dr. GRIFFIN. I understand, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. And we are all searching.
The final thing is when might we expect a plan for managing the

cost overruns for the James Webb Space Telescope?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Again,  sir,  I  was  apprised  of  those  potential  cost
overruns  last  month.  Within  48  hours  of  having  been  so  apprised,
we,  at  NASA,  chartered  a  special  team  to  review  those  costs  with
the  action  to  reduce  them  where  possible  or  where  they  are  real,
to  recognize  them  and  to  replan  the  rest  of  the  program  around
them.  The  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  is  the  centerpiece  of  our
astronomy  program  going  forward,  no  question  about  it,  but  we
need  to  make  sure  that  we  have  an  executable  program  with  real-
istic  dates.  When  we  have  that  information,  again,  not  later  than
the end of this summer, I will bring it to this committee.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  It  is  very  apparent  that  you  have  a  lot  of
busy  days  ahead,  and  we  don’t  expect  you  to  wave  a  magic  wand
and  perform  miracles,  but  I  hope  you  can  appreciate  the  desire  on
the  part  of  this  committee,  on  both  sides,  to  get  answers  to  some
of these basic questions that guide us as we go forward with chart-
ing the course for the future of NASA.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Sir,  I  could  not  more  fully  understand  and  appre-
ciate  the  need  to  do  that.  And  I—we  are  with  you  in  this  search
for answers. And as rapidly as we can provide responsive and rea-
sonably complete answers, this committee will have them.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Gordon.

BUDGET FIREWALLS

Mr.  GORDON.  First  of  all,  let  me  say,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you
for getting those questions on the record. I think it is important for
us to, in our mission of oversight, and quite frankly, I say that we
haven’t  done  as  good  a  job  of  oversight  as  we  should  have  in  the
past,  because  we  haven’t  gotten  those  kinds  of  answers.  And  I
think,  Dr.  Griffin,  your  suggestion  of  September  is  realistic  and
reasonable.  You  have  got  a  lot  to  review.  But  I  will  also  point  out,
that  is  only  a  few  days  before  the  beginning  of  the  fiscal  year,
which  is  again  why  I  would  suggest  that  there  not  be  major  rede-
fining  of  NASA  and  of  some  of  the  goals  there  until  you  have  a
chance  to  get  through  this.  So  I  would  hope  that  you  keep  that  in
mind.

37

And let me move forward with my questions.
Dr.  Griffin,  in  my  opening  statement,  I  mentioned  a  number  of
changes that have been made to NASA’s exploration program since
you  arrived.  I  did  that  not  to  question  your  decisions  but  to  make
the  point  that  a  lot  is  in  flux  within  NASA’s  exploration  program.
And  a  lot  of  what  Congress  and  the  industry  was  told  last  year  is
no  longer  relevant.  Unfortunately,  NASA  has  a  history  of  such
changes.  The  Space  Station  program  seemed  to  change  almost
every  year  since  its  initiation  in  the  mid-1980s,  and  I  understand
you are now considering restructuring it again. In 1994, NASA an-
nounced its single stage to orbit launch vehicle program with much
fanfare. A few years later, the program was canceled before the X–
33 test vehicle even flew.

Then  NASA  announced  that  it  was  instead  going  to  initiate  the
space  launch  vehicle  within  the  goals  of  developing  a  next-genera-
tion  reusable  launch  vehicle  and  other  advanced  technologies.  A
few years later, NASA canceled the space launch initiative and said
that  its  new  plan  was  to  build  an  Orbital  Space  Plane.  Well,  the
Orbital Space Plane program last year was also canceled.

Then last year, NASA announced its plan to develop a Crew Ex-
ploration  Vehicle,  using  a  spiral  development  approach.  This  pro-
gram  apparently,  the  CEV  program,  is  being  restructured  and  the
acquisition approach changed. And many other changes are appar-
ently being made to the exploration program. That may be the best
thing  to  do,  and  I  think  it  probably  is,  Dr.  Griffin,  but  given
NASA’s record, it is hard to take that on faith.

So, Dr. Griffin, you are not going to have a lot of room to maneu-
ver  when  it  comes  to  the  budgets,  which  you  will  likely  see  over
the  next  few  years.  So  how  do  you  plan  to  ensure  that  your  explo-
ration  program  is  not  subject  to  the  same  errant  changes  that  we
have  seen  from  NASA  in  the  past?  In  other  words,  what  are  you
going  to  do  differently?  And  also,  do  you  feel  that  it  is  necessary
to  set  up  firewalls?  Or  what  are  you  going  to  do  in  these  tough
budget  times  to  stop  poaching  into  other  areas  of  NASA’s  budget?
Or  do  you  think  that  is  necessary?  And  is  it  inevitable  that  will
happen?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Let me answer the last question first, sir, if I might.
I don’t believe that we are allowing the manned space flight pro-
gram  to  poach  onto  other  areas.  I  have  committed,  often  and  pub-
licly, that I intend to, want to, and will protect NASA’s science pro-
gram  from  the  demands  of  human  space  flight,  and  frankly,  vice
versa. If the James Webb Space Telescope overruns, it is the prob-
lem  of  the  astronomy  folks,  not  the  Shuttle  folks.  They  have  their
own problems.

Mr. GORDON. Do you see setting up firewalls or what, other than

just good faith? And how do you intend to try to do that?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, I don’t think, sir, that we need legal firewalls,
because  the  preservation  of  flexibility,  in  the  event  of  an  emer-
gency, is always important, as, for example, in recovering returning
to flight from Columbia, we—NASA did not receive a supplemental
as  we  did  in  the  Challenger—the  aftermath  of  the  Challenger  dis-
aster.  And  so,  if  we  were  to  return-to-flight,  there  was  no  alter-
native  but  to  reprogram  funds.  And  this  committee,  and  others,
were very helpful in allowing us to do that.

So I think the avoidance of——
Mr. GORDON. There was a process——
Dr. GRIFFIN. Pardon, sir?
Mr. GORDON. There was a process there——
Dr. GRIFFIN. There was.
Mr. GORDON.—that allowed you to meet those emergencies.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  And  I  would  use  that  process  again.  So  I  would
rather avoid legal restrictions on flexibility, and I would rather rely
on  working  with  this  committee  to  establish  the  correctness  and
the  utility  of  the  decisions  that  are  being  made.  You  mentioned
that  you  didn’t  want  to  appear  to  be  questioning  my  decisions.  On
the  contrary,  sir,  I  think  you  should.  If  I  make  decisions  that  can-
not stand up to the light of day, I think they should be questioned.
Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  we  may  do  that  in  September  once  we  hear

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir.
You asked what we will be doing different.
First  of  all,  I  hope  never  again  to  let  the  words  ‘‘spiral  develop-
ment’’  cross  my  lips.  That  is  an  approach  to  acquisition  for  large
systems, very relevant to DOD acquisition requirements, but I have
not seen the relevance to NASA, and I have preferred a much more
direct approach, and that is what we will be recommending and im-
plementing.

them.

What else will be different? I hope that you will see, as we bring
it  forward,  a  very  straightforward  plan  to  replace  the  Shuttle  and
a  very  straightforward  architecture  for  lunar  return.  That,  on  the
face  of  it,  will  seem  to  you  that  if  we  are  to  do  these  things  that
the  approach  being  recommended  is  a  logical,  clean,  simple,
straightforward approach.

We—you  mentioned,  sir,  in  your  opening  remarks,  the—post-
poning the arrival date at Mars in order that we can do the proper
things  now,  and  I  agree.  The  money  that  is  being  spent  that  is
being  tagged  with  exploration  initiative  funding  in  these  early
years is really, almost entirely, for the completion of the Space Sta-
tion and for the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle. That
is  what  is  being  done  with  the  money  that  is  being  provided.  And
in fact, we need all of it that we can get in order that we not have,
in my view, a strategically undesirable gap between the retirement
of the Shuttle and brining online the CEV.

I  don’t  think  it  is  too  soon  to  undertake  the  redefinition  of  what
we  are  doing  in  NASA  that  you  have  mentioned.  I  don’t  think  we
need  a  year  to  take  a  deep  breath,  because  in  the  course  of  that
year, we would be spending a lot of money. There are many things,
which were on the table when I walked in the door at NASA, that
needed to be reexamined, and I felt, honestly, sir, that the soonest
that  we  could  do  that  and  stop  spending  money  in  directions  that
we felt were unprofitable and unpalatable, the soonest that I could
do that would be none too soon.

We  have  submitted  to  this  Congress  the—a  revised  operating
plan for 2005. We will be putting forward a budget amendment for
fiscal year 2006 to reflect some of these changes in priorities.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Calvert.
Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

RETURNING TO FLIGHT

Obviously, the hot topic on the news today is returning to flight.
And  last  evening,  there  was  a  report  that  indicated  there  were
some  problems  but  that  they  anticipate  returning  to  flight  soon.  I
just thought we would ask your current assessment of the plans to
return the Shuttle to flight. And do you still anticipate that we will
be able to do that launch on July 13?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Let me start with the end.
Yes,  sir.  We  have  several  days  of  slack  available  between  today
and  launch  on  July  13.  We  look  like  we  are  in  pretty  good  shape
there.  We  have  a  flight  readiness  review,  the  formal  flight  readi-
ness review, tomorrow and Thursday, which I will be attending. In
fact,  I  will  be  leaving  this  evening  for  Kennedy  Space  Center.  I
have  participated  in  every  technical  review  that  was  appropriate
for me to do since coming on board as Administrator. And I believe
I have acquired a pretty good picture of where we are with respect
to  the  technical  requirements  to  return-to-flight.  I  have  been  tre-
mendously impressed with the work that the team has done in exe-
cuting  those  improvements,  and  I  think,  based  on  what  I  know
now,  we  are  ready  to  go.  The  flight  readiness  review  for  the  next
couple  of  days  will  either  uncover  an  exception  to  that  statement
or will endorse it. And we will all see.
Mr. CALVERT. That is good to hear.

THE CENTRIFUGE

One of the questions that you answered indicated an obvious sit-
uation  that  we  are  not  going  to  be  able  to  fly  the  28  Shuttle  mis-
sions  that  were  anticipated  to  finish  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion  to  some  degree  that  some  folks  would  like  to  happen.  I  was
wondering,  with  regard  to  the  Centrifuge,  when  do  you  see  the  fu-
ture  of  that,  and  are  we  going  to  be  able  to  move  forward  with
human exploration without performing that research that the Cen-
trifuge  was  to  provide?  Or  is  there  another  way  to  get  that  Cen-
trifuge up there?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  the—in  the  fullness  of  time,  there  is  always
a  way  to  get  anything  up  there.  The  Centrifuge  accommodation
module was—is being considered as to whether or not it should be
flown,  given  the  focus  of  Station  research  on  the  effects  on  the
human  organism  of  microgravity.  Centrifuge  can’t,  of  course,  ac-
commodate  a  human.  It  can  accommodate  tissue  or  small  animals
for  fundamental,  cellular-based,  life  science  research.  That  sort  of
research  at  the  cellular  level  is  not  directly  applicable  and  would
not  be  for  many  years  to  problems  of  flying  humans  on  voyages
back  to  the  Moon  or  Mars.  And  so  in  that  sense  of  reorienting  the
Station’s mission to focus on human exploration rather than funda-
mental life science research, the Centrifuge accommodation module
is in——[inaudible].

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Mr.  CALVERT.  One  other  question  I  have  that—I  know  that  you
have only been there a couple of months, but as you know, for the
last  three  of  the  four  years,  NASA  has  been  unable  to  produce
auditable  financial  statements.  Auditors  have  highlighted  a  num-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

40

ber of weaknesses with NASA’s financial statements, as you know.
So  what  is  your  assessment,  so  far,  of  this  situation,  and  what  do
you have in mind to fix it?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  The  situation  is  deplorable.  It  is  unacceptable  that
NASA  cannot  meet  the  standards  for  financial  acumen  to  which  it
holds  its  contractors.  We—I  was  apprised  of  this  during  my
preconfirmation  visits  here  on  the  Hill  and  scarcely  a  week  has
gone by that I have not been reminded of it. We have provided ad-
ditional  personnel  and  additional  budgetary  resources  to  address
the  issue.  We  have,  in  fact,  invited  leading  financial  management
experts  from  other  federal  agencies  to  review  our  plans  and  have
incorporated  their  suggestions.  I  have  empowered  the  CFO  to  exe-
cute  these  plans  and  take  actions  that  should  produce  a  long-term
financial health of the Agency.

We  are  trying  to—we  have  three  core  priorities  that  we  are  try-
ing to achieve. The first exercise is to generate a clean opinion from
our auditors, just to simply know where all our money is and have
our auditors agree that we do. With regard to developing our budg-
et,  we  want  to  resolve  issues  of  how  we  control  our  funding  dis-
tribution,  how  we  should  standardize  our  financial  data  structure,
and  how  we  are  going  to  standardize  our  budget  formulation  proc-
ess. And finally, we need to standardize our management reporting
methodology  and  financial  management  metric.  We—our  major
challenges are to reconcile the fund balance with treasury accounts,
to provide an auditable evaluation of our property plant and equip-
ment  and  environmental  liabilities,  and  to  improve  our  financial
data  integrity  and  compliance  with  the  Federal  Accounting  Stand-
ards board and OMB and Treasury requirements.

We  know  the  challenge  in  front  of  us.  We  are  getting  the  best
external and internal help that we can to execute it. I take it very
seriously.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Doctor,  and  I  look  forward  to  working
with  the  Chairman  to  have,  maybe,  a  hearing  about  this  later  on
and be more specific on this problem.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Udall.
Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Griffin,  if  we  could,  I  would  like  to  focus  on  the  aeronautics
side  to  the  equation  and  also  ask  you  a  couple  of  questions  about
Hubble.

AERONAUTICS

As  I  mentioned  in  my  opening  statement,  there  has  been  a
steady  drumbeat  of  task  force  reports  and  testimony  that  make  a
compelling  case  that  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  is  at  serious
risk. The five-year funding trend contained in the President’s 2006
budget,  I  think,  could  render  the  aeronautics  side  of  the  equation
irrelevant.  Could  you  just  comment,  as  the  NASA  Administrator,
on  what  you  are  planning  to  do,  if  anything,  to  reverse  that  de-
cline?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, the President’s budget for aeronautics is what
it  is.  And  what  I  am  committed  to  do  is  utilizing  that  budget  in
the  most  effective  way  possible.  I  absolutely  believe  in  the  impor-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

41

tance  of  aeronautics  for  NASA  and  for  this  nation,  and  I  under-
stand  that  we  have  stakeholders  in  industry,  in  DOD,  with  the
FAA,  and  even  internally  within  NASA,  all  of  whom  to  which  the
aeronautics program is of first rank.

I think we need to focus our efforts going forward more than they
have  been.  I  think  NASA  does  its  best  when  our  aeronautics  pro-
grams are focused around key technical demonstrations, which are
of a groundbreaking nature. We have had much in the aeronautics
community,  which  is  of  a  business-as-usual,  keep-funding,  keep-
programs-alive  nature,  and  I  am  looking  to  restructure.  I  have
been, in fact, one of the voices, noting that the last time the Nation
had  a  strategic  plan  in  aeronautics,  it  was  issued  by  the  Office  of
Science  and  Technology  Policy,  and  the  date  it  carried  was  1982.
I  have  the  report.  I  am  in  full  support  of  this  committee’s  and  the
House’s recommendation that we have a new aeronautics strategy.
Mr.  UDALL.  Do  I  hear  you  say,  then,  that  you  more  aggressively

promote the aeronautics side of the NASA mission?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Within the context of the President’s budget, I abso-
lutely  will.  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  our  aeronautics  program.  I
think we need to be looking at what we can do with almost $1 bil-
lion  in  funding  rather  than  complaining  constantly  that  it  isn’t
enough.

Mr.  UDALL.  But  if  I  could,  I  would  ask  you,  and  I  think  you
would  have  a  lot  of  support  on  the  Committee,  to  push  for  addi-
tional  funding.  I  think  the  flat-line  trend  puts  us  further  behind
the  eight  ball,  and  it  is  my  opinion  that  the  results,  the  economic
return,  on  the  aeronautic  side,  is  equal  to  that  of  the  space  side.
Could  we  count  on  you  to  push  for—within  the  context  of  your  re-
sponsibilities,  additional  funding,  at  least  to  keep  pace  with  infla-
tion?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Sir, my first priority will be to effectively—to utilize
effectively the money that we are given. I will be working with this
committee and other executive agencies to do that.

Mr. UDALL. Let me turn—and I think this conversation will con-

tinue, if I might conclude in that way——

Dr. GRIFFIN. Sure.
Mr.  UDALL.—because  I  do  think  the  aeronautics  side  is  crucial

across the whole series of fronts.

HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE

Let us turn to Hubble. Again, I want to thank you for your will-
ingness to revisit the Hubble policy. I know you have asked a team
out at Goddard to start planning for such a mission. Could you talk
about  what  they  are  doing?  And  then  would  you  talk  about  your
comment  that  after  the  first  two  successful  return-to-flight  mis-
sions, and I am going to presume, as we all do here, that these are
going  to  be  successful  return-to-flight  missions,  what  are  the  cri-
teria  you  are  going  to  use  to  decide  whether  to  proceed  with  the
Hubble servicing mission?

Dr. GRIFFIN. There are some detailed test objectives to be accom-
plished  on  these  flights  that  have  to  do—that  do  affect  our  ability
to execute Hubble Servicing Mission 4, SM–4, as it is known. They
have to do with available crew time for EVA, other EVA guidelines,
use  of  the  manipulator  arm  for  tile  inspections.  What  we  do  with

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

regard  to  those  procedures,  they  need  to  be  worked  out  before  we
can fully commit—before I could responsibly commit to you that we
should  undertake  the  servicing  mission.  What  I  have  said  in  prior
testimony and in public remarks is that by this fall, when we have
completed  those  two  missions,  we  will  know  those  answers.  And  if
those  answers  are  favorable,  then  I  will  recommend  that  we  exe-
cute  Hubble  Servicing  Mission  4  with  the  Shuttle  and  restore  the
Hubble to health and to a stable orbit for, you know, the next half
dozen years or more.

Mr.  UDALL.  Doctor,  do  you  have  any  cost  estimates  on  the
Hubble  servicing  mission  and  any  sense  of  how  much  might  be
funded by the science account in the fiscal year 2006?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  don’t  have  those  estimates  currently,  no,  I  am
sorry.  We  can  provide  those  to  you  for  the  record.  I  have  also  not
looked  at,  yet,  the  structure  of  what  that  mission  might  consist.
Much of the cost depends on the assumptions that go into the mis-
sion,  and  we  have  not  flown—all  of  the  missions  we  have  flown  of
that vein beforehand, of course, were prior to the loss of Columbia,
and we need to think through how we would intend to do this mis-
sion.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Let me ask you, Mr. Administrator, and come closer to the micro-

phone, because we are anxious to hear what you have to say.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Oh, I am sorry.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Is it still the operative plan within NASA,
as  you  undergo  this  strategic  review  in  your  workforce,  that  there
will be no layoffs, at least until 2007, if then?

Dr. GRIFFIN. I believe that is where we are at present.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay. Thank you very much.
Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
And  I  would  like  to  welcome  the  new  Administrator.  Thank  you

very much.

THE IRAN NONPROLIFERATION ACT

Let  me  note  that  our  Chairman  compared  you  to  the  man  from
La  Mancha,  which  I  found  very  disturbing,  Mr.  Chairman.  In  fact,
after considering that of the four top NASA executives, that all four
of  them  are  leaving,  will  be  gone  shortly,  I  think  that  we  should
compare  you  more  to  Conan  the  Barbarian  rather  than  the  man
from  La  Mancha.  So—but  we—but  our  governor  in  California  has
already  secured  himself  that  designation.  So  we  will  be  searching
for an appropriate title that will exemplify your Administration.

Let me note that you have started very, very well. And you have
been bold. You have been making decisions. You have been setting
up  a  process  in  order  to  make  the  decisions  that  can’t  be  made
now. And you can count on all of us here on both sides of the aisle
to be working with you.

A  little  disagreement  with  my—with  the  Ranking  Member.  I
would  suggest  that  you  actually  take  as  much  money  from  the
Mars  part  of  the  program  and  spend  it  on  meeting  the  current
challenges. Spending money too soon in such a long-term project as
going to Mars, spending money would be wasteful rather than try-
ing  to  meet  the  challenges  we  have  now  and  then  using  new  tech-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

43

nology in the years ahead, rather than trying to develop technology
today for something that may not be applicable because of changes
in the future.

I  would  like  to  specifically  talk  to  you  right  now  about,  and  get
your  reaction  to,  something  that  I  see  as  your  ultimate  short-term
challenge,  and  you  mentioned  it  in  terms  of  the  Shuttle  and  the
Space  Station.  And  the  greatest  impediment  to  you,  which  I  can
see,  of  actually  meeting  that  challenge  of  making  sure  that  the
Space Station project is finished and reaches its potential, and plus
our—that we know about in terms of the limitations of the Shuttle.
And  I  guess  what  I  am  talking  about  is  the  Iran  Nonproliferation
Act.  And  let  me  note,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  I  was  very  deeply  in-
volved  in  the  wording  of  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  in  dealing
with  this  particular  challenge  that  we  face  right  here.  And  I  will
say  that  it  was  a  worthy  effort  at  the  time  to  make  sure  that  we
pressured the Russians not to participate in the developing of a nu-
clear  facility  in  Iran.  That  strategy  has,  however,  not  worked.
Clearly,  it  has  not  worked.  Unfortunately  when  the  Nonprolifera-
tion Act was put into place in the year 2000, both during the Clin-
ton Administration and during this Administration, what needed to
happen  was  some  type  of  an  overture  to  the  Russians  that  would
give them an alternative. Neither Administration did its job in the
past, and now you, after two months as being leader of NASA, are
faced with this very serious time period when we have to make de-
cisions  and  we  have  to  move  forward  and  decisions  have  to  be
made.

And so you aren’t to blame. I would put the blame on the Clinton
Administration  as  well  as  the  Bush  Administration  for  not  doing
this, but now we have got this decision to make.

Do  you  believe,  and  you  have  background  with—but  we  know
that the Defense Department has been able to work with the Rus-
sians all along, even with the Nonproliferation Act. Do you believe
that  we  should  now  shift  into  more  of  a  policy  with  NASA  that  is
more like what you have in the Department of Defense and just re-
alize  that  the  Nonproliferation  Act  is  not  working  and  Space  Sta-
tion has got to be completed?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  yes,  sir,  broadly  speaking,  I  do  support  that.
And  as  I  said  earlier,  the  Administration  is  just  releasing,  I,  in
fact,  signed  today  jointly  with  Secretary  of  State  Rice,  a  letter  to
this  committee  requesting  that  we  do  amend  the  act.  It  is  worthy
of  note  that  it  is,  today,  possible  for  the  Defense  Department,
through its contractors, to buy Russian engines for Defense Depart-
ment  purposes,  but  if  we  would  seek  to  use  one  of  those  engines
to  support  the  International  Space  Station  program,  it  would  not
be  possible  under  the  act,  and—as  it  exists  today,  and  that  is  an
interesting——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  you  need  not  be  burdened  with  things
that were so weighty, let us say, as the Nonproliferation Act, which
was not, as I say, followed through on. It was not handled correctly
by  those  who  preceded  you,  as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  Administra-
tions,  both  the  Clinton  and  Bush  Administrations.  Is  there  any
other way out that you see?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Other  than  an  amendment  of  the  Act,  no,  sir.  As  I
pointed  out  earlier,  the  only  approach  that  we  can  take  would  be

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

to cease buying Progress and Soyuz services from Russia and to re-
strict our astronaut time on the Space Station to periods when the
Shuttle is present.

I  would  also  point  out  that  while,  you  know,  we  have  alliances
and  differences  with  Russia,  that  among  the  best  things  to  have
come  from  our  space  program  over  the  last  15  years  is  the  space
cooperation that we have enjoyed with Russia. And if the act is not
amended, that will come to a halt in April of 2006.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  it  was  a  worthy  goal.  We  tried,  Mr.
Chairman,  to  make  sure  that  we  used  all  of  the  leverage  we  had,
including  space  cooperation  with  the  Russians  to  try  to  get  them
out  of  this  nuclear  power  plant  down  in  Iran.  It  did  not  work.
There is no reason for us not to be realistic, and I applaud you and
the Administration now for being realistic, although I think the Ad-
ministration  shares  a  great  deal  of  blame  for  bringing  us  to  this
point.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, sir, none of us like this position. And the fact
is that for the next several years, as the Space Station development
and its partnership go forward, the United States is in the position
where  we  cannot  effectively  utilize  the  Space  Station  without  our
Russian  partners.  This  strategic  dependence,  in  a  critical  area,  is
why I have spoken up so strongly since coming into this new posi-
tion  for  narrowing  the  gap  between  Shuttle  retirement  and  Crew
Exploration  Vehicle  deployment.  That  is  why  I  have  subordinated
other  important  priorities  within  NASA  to  that  priority,  because  I
believe—I  absolutely  believe  that  it  is  strategically  essential  that
the United States have its own access to space, dependent upon no

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  In  effect,  it  says  that  within  the  Adminis-
tration, a proposed amendment is still being vetted, and we can an-
ticipate something in the short-term. So thank you.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  think  the  details  of  the  wording,  that  is  correct,
but with the broad principle that we need an amendment. I believe
that is accepted.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you.

Mr. HONDA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And welcome, Mr. Griffin. It is good seeing you again.

CENTER WORKFORCE

Mr.  HONDA.  A  lot  of  the  questions  I  wanted  to  ask  were  asked
already. And I think your responses were clear and very forthright,
and I appreciate that.

And I look forward to September where we get more information
from you in terms of what the timeline on the calendar is going to
look like for our programs.

The previous Administrator had set up the budget in such a way
that  it  appeared  that  our  different  centers  would  be  operating  as
if they were R&D outsourced agencies. And I heard you say that—
and  I  read  that  you  had  said  that  you  are  changing  the  direction
and trying to retain the core competence of those engineers and sci-
entists  that  we  have  at  these  centers  so  that  they  can  do  what  we
do  best  and  what  NASA’s  mission  has  been  set  out  in—originally.
Understanding that and seeing that and looking at the proposed
budget  for  NASA  for  2006,  what  is  it  in  the  budget  that  you  see
right now that needs to be revisited or looked at in terms of policy
refinement  in  our  budget  for  authorization  so  that  you  can  move
forward  with  the  mission  that  you  laid  out  and  that  you  see  that
needs to be done in the near future? Not only the mission, but also
in  terms  of  how  we  are  going  to  be  able  to  maintain  the  staffing
that  we  currently  have  without  compromising  our  core  com-
petencies and the direction that you would like to take NASA.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Yes,  sir.  I  feel  like  I  am  becoming  repetitive  with
this  answer,  but  we  have  yet  another  team  of  senior  folks  within
NASA——

Mr. HONDA. I remember that. Yeah.
Dr. GRIFFIN.—who are looking at exactly the question you raised
of  how  do  we  need  to  restructure  our  fiscal  year  2006  plans  in
order  to  preserve  core  competencies  within  the  NASA  centers.
Those results, also, will be available within the next few weeks. In
fact, we must have them within that time in order to present—pre-
vent other undesirable actions.

Philosophically, there are—there is probably no one you will have
before  you  who  is  a  stronger  supporter  of  the  broad  principles  of
competition and industrial capability than I. I have run businesses,
which had to make money. I have been an entrepreneur.

But all of that said, federal research centers and laboratories are
not  operating  businesses.  They  don’t  exist  for  that  purpose.  They
exist  to  make  investments  on  behalf  of  the  American  people  that
it  has  been  determined  by  the  Congress  are  necessary  to  be  made.
And  they  don’t  operate,  and  should  not  operate,  on  the  principles
of  short-term  gain  or  next  quarter  profitability.  So  we  will  not  be
running  our  NASA  federal  centers  as  if  they  were  our  outsourced
laboratories  for  R&D.  We  will  be  making  strategic  assignments  of
missions—mission areas and work to those centers in order to pre-
serve the core competencies that we feel we have to have going for-
ward  to  execute  NASA’s  science  missions,  the  vision  for  explo-
ration, and aeronautics.

They won’t be, necessarily, the exact same missions that we had
been  performing  in  the  past  or  even  are  performing  today.  During
my  round  of  center  visits,  including  to  Ames  and  other  aeronautic
centers,  I  have  pointed  out  that  in  fairness,  the  research  centers,
as opposed to the mission and flight operation centers, the research
centers should be on the cutting edge of change. They should be on
the very edge of the frontier of what it means to be doing research
and  development  for  space  and  aeronautics.  Just  as  today  we  no
longer  have  manufacturers  who  produce  slide  rules,  today  we  may
well not need every wind tunnel that exists within NASA. But the
role  of  research  within  NASA,  to  keep  this  Nation  on  the  cutting

48

edge  of  space  and  aeronautics  technology  development,  cannot  be
denied, and it is uniquely NASA’s, and I support it totally.

FFRDC

Mr.  HONDA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  If  I  may,  a  quick  question.
Then  have  you  reached  any  conclusions  about  the  recommenda-
tion  to  convert  centers  to  alternative  structures,  such  as  the
FFRDC?

Dr. GRIFFIN. I have worked at NASA centers, and I have worked
at  FFRDCs.  Both  are  excellent  investments,  in  my  opinion,  of  fed-
eral tax dollars. I do not fundamentally see any gain to be achieved
by having NASA convert federal centers to FFRDCs, and the doing
of so—such—so doing would, in fact, create pension and retirement
system  liabilities  that  I  don’t  believe  this  Congress  is  prepared  to
take on in the current budget environment.

Mr.  HONDA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  just  as  a  personal
comment,  this  program  and  these  projects  have  been  in  such  tur-
moil  in  the  last  few  years  that  a  lot  of  these—being  repeated,  and
if  we  are  talking  about  Don  Quixote  de  La  Mancha,  he  had  more
than  one  or  two  windmills  he  had  to  hit,  and  sometimes  it  looked
like  the  same  ones.  And  I  think  that  people’s  lives  and  people’s
projects  that  are  affected  sometimes  require  repetition  for  the—to
replace  the  kinds  of  sentiments  that  had  been  growing  for  these
past few years, and I, for myself, do appreciate your leadership.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. HONDA. Thank you.

SAFETY AND RISK

Let  me  first  say,  Mr.  Administrator,  how  pleased  I  am  that  you
are  in  this  position.  NASA  is  at  a  very  crucial  juncture,  and  you
are  the  type  of  person  and  have  the  right  background  to  solve  the
multitude  of  problems  that  we  have  been  talking  about  this  morn-
ing, and I appreciate your willingness to take on this almost impos-
sible task.

I would like to join my colleagues who have expressed their sup-
port for the Hubble servicing mission. I won’t go into a lot of details
on that, but I would simply point out we have done it several times
before  with  far  less  safety  concerns  than  we  are  facing  right  now,
and we completed the missions safely.

I  worry,  frankly,  and  this  is  not  just  relating  to  the  Hubble  re-
pair mission, that we have become so safety conscious after the Co-
lumbia  accident  that  we  may  be  needlessly  eliminating  our  space
exploration  efforts.  We  have  to  recognize,  as  American  people,  you
cannot guarantee absolute safety, but I think at this point, you are
certainly  very  close  to  exceeding  the  safety  standards  that  every
American has when they enter their automobile and drive through
traffic in this country. They don’t stay at home because there might
be an accident. And similarly, I don’t think you should stay on the
ground,  or  your  astronauts  should  stay  on  the  ground,  because
there  might  be  an  accident.  They  recognize  full  well,  and  I  have

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

discussed  this  with  them  the  risks  involved.  They  understood  that
full  well  when  they  became  test  pilots,  the  many  who  have  served
in  that  capacity.  And  I  suspect  we  are  going  in  a  direction  where
we are trying to make our spacecrafts safer than the test aircrafts
that  they  flew  in  the  past.  So  I  just—I  am  just  urging  some  com-
mon sense and not an atmosphere of fear that I think has pervaded
a  lot  of—that  has  infected  a  lot  of  people  since  the  Columbia  acci-
dent.

I  certainly  hope  you  are  able  to  do  the  Hubble  repair  mission
and,  of  course,  do  it  as  safely  as  possible,  but  not  be  Earth-bound
by it by fear of what might happen.

VOYAGER AND CEV

The  second  point  I  would  like  to  make  is  Voyager  I,  which  I
think  has  reached  a  very  crucial  juncture  in  its  voyage.  And  I  un-
derstand that there is some talk of terminating that particular mis-
sion.  You,  of  course,  can’t  terminate  Voyager  I.  It  is  still  going  to
be  out  there  transmitting  the  data,  but  that,  for  financial  reasons,
we  are  not  going  to  continue  recording  the  data.  I,  once  again,
would  plead  with  you  to  keep  that  effort  going.  It  seems  foolish  to
wait all of these years for it to reach the—and then somebody pull
the  plug.  So  I  hope—and  I  would  be  happy  to  work  with  you  and
I  am  willing  to  try  to  help  you  identify  other  things  that  could  be
cut  instead.  But  I  plead  with  you  to  keep  Voyager  I  going.  And—
I  shouldn’t  say  that.  It  is  going  to  keep  going,  but  keep  collecting
data, and even if we may have to slow down the analysis for finan-
cial  reasons,  at  least  collect  it  and  let  future  generations  of  sci-
entists have that information.

My  final  point  is  I  think  the  highest  priority  you  have,  other
than these two aspects, is development of the Crew Exploration Ve-
hicle.  And  I  think  when  you  mentioned  earlier  the  need  for  re-
search,  that  is  clearly  an  area  where  we  need,  I  think,  some  very
new  ideas,  some  very  basic,  fundamental  research,  to  try  to  come
up  with  new  approaches,  particularly  if  we  are  hoping  to  travel  to
Mars  some  time  in  the  future.  We  have  to  develop  better  propul-
sion  systems.  And  the  CEV  is  a  golden  opportunity  to  really  look
at some new ideas that have developed since the Shuttle was devel-
oped.  And  so  I  wish  you  well  in  that.  And  I  really  think  you  were
correct  when  you  say  it  is  a  very  high  priority.  I  think  it  has  to
be  your  highest  priority,  other  than  the  various  satellites  that  are
out there now.

I  would  appreciate  any  comments  or  reaction  you  might  have  to

any of these points.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Sir,  with  regard  to  to  the  preservation  of  operating
satellites,  we  are—we  have  heard  the  voice  of  the  community  and
the  Congress  in  this  topic.  We  are  doing  a  fresh,  top-down  review
on  what  satellites  will  be  kept  in  operation  and  which  ones  will
not.  And  I  assure  you  that  I  also  think  it  is  rather  dumb  to  be
turning  off  Voyagers  I  and  II.  Nonetheless,  you  will  hear  our  final
answers on that a little bit later this year.

With  regard  to  the  priority  of  the  CEV,  in  my  view,  it  is  right
behind—it is my number two priority, after flying the Shuttle safe-
ly  in  the  remaining  years  of  its  operation.  So  I  support  your  re-
marks.

LIFE SCIENCE RESEARCH

Administrator  Griffin,  I  am  pleased  to  see  you  here.  A  couple  of
years  ago,  the  investigation  into  the  Shuttle  disaster  concluded
that  one  of  the  problems  was  that  NASA  had  contracted  out  too
much  expertise,  that  there  was  not  the  nucleus  of  expertise  in-
house  at  NASA,  that  they  needed  to  be  at  each  other’s  elbows  to
do  the  job  that  they  needed  to  do.  I  asked  Sean  O’Keefe  if  he  em-
braced  that  finding,  since  it  did  appear  to  be  contrary  to  deviate
from  the  Administration’s  orthodoxy  about  contracting  out,  and  I
never  got  an  answer,  although,  when  he  got  through  not  answer-
ing, the light was red. So I am very pleased to have heard you em-
brace that idea that we do need to maintain that nucleus of exper-
tise within NASA and that you will push for that in future budgets.
I  do  have  a  couple  of  questions  about  other  programs.  You  did
say earlier that you thought that there was not an immediate need
for  life  science  research  into  longer-term  human  travel  into  space,
because  we  aren’t  going  to  do  it  right  away.  But  what  is  going  to
be the effect of a break in research in that? If we don’t have contin-
uous research, how easy is it going to be to pick back up after hav-
ing essentially stopped the life science and the biomedical research
that we had been doing and need to do at some point before we do
longer-term space travel?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, sir, in response to that question, I believe the
answer is fairly obvious to any of us who have ever been grad stu-
dents  in  our  lives.  Most  of  the  kind  of  research,  fundamental  re-
search  that  we  talk  about  is  done  in  universities  or  in  programs
where  universities  are  part.  And  it  will,  if  we  are  not  able  to  fund
all  of  the  work  in  fundamental  life  science,  the  researchers  who
were doing it will go elsewhere to other occupations, other research
endeavors  that  are  being  funded,  and  we  will  have  to  put  the  pro-
gram back together later.

Mr. MILLER. Okay.
Dr.  GRIFFIN.  That  is  just  a  fact.  But  I  cannot  responsibly
prioritize  microbiology  and  fundamental  life  science  research  high-
er  than  the  need  for  the  United  States  to  have  strategic—its  own
strategic access to space.

Mr.  MILLER.  Well,  I  am  not  happy  with  that  answer,  but  it  was

an answer.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir. And I am sorry, I am not happy with it ei-

ther, but I don’t know what else to do.

SPACE GRANT PROGRAMS

Mr. MILLER. One additional question about this space grant pro-
gram.  It  is  hard  not  to  look  at  NASA’s  request  and  Congress’s  ap-
propriations  and  not  come  to  the  conclusion  that  Congress  values
the  space  grants  program  more  highly  than  NASA  does.  I  think
Congress,  in  fiscal  year  2003,  appropriated  $24,100,000  for  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:38 May 19, 2006 Jkt 021949 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\062805\21949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

51

space  grant  program.  The  request  the  next  year  from  NASA  was
$19,100,000,  and  it  kind  of  goes  on  every  year.  What  is  your  take
on the space grant program? Do you support that program? Do you
think it is important in providing the kind of flow of expertise that
we  need?  Is  there  something  we  ought  to  be  doing  instead  of  the
space grant program?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  would  have  to  take  that  question  for  the  record,
sir.  I  am  actually  not  familiar  with  the  program,  and  in  the  two
and one-half months I have been on board, have not had the oppor-
tunity to become so. So we will take a look at it, and I will get you
a responsive answer, but it will have to be for the record.

Mr. MILLER. Okay. Thank you.

INFORMATION FOR THE RECORD

The  National  Space  Grant  College  and  Fellowship  Program  (Space  Grant)  con-
tinues to be a critical component in our education portfolio, particularly with regard
to  addressing  workforce  needs  of  both  NASA  and  the  national  aerospace  industry.
Our experience is that the Space Grant program also has been very effective in de-
veloping  a  national  network  of  affiliated  organizations,  now  comprised  of  over  550
colleges  and  universities,  80  industry  affiliates,  40  government  affiliates,  and  180
non-profit  and  other  educational  organizations.  This  network  is  a  critical  strategic
element  for  preserving  and  cultivating  our  future  workforce  expertise  in  disciplines
needed for future space exploration.

The  focus  of  NASA  education  is  best  presented  in  terms  of  its  three  major  stra-
tegic  outcomes:  (1)  Strengthening  NASA’s  and  the  Nation’s  future  science,  tech-
nology,  engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  workforce;  (2)  Attracting  and  retain-
ing students in STEM disciplines through a progression of educational opportunities
for  students,  teachers  and  faculty;  and  (3)  Engaging  Americans  in  NASA’s  mission
through partnerships and alliances.

The  Space  Grant  Program  has  and  is  expected  to  continue  to  assist  NASA  in

achieving these outcomes in several ways:

• Student  Pipeline:  Program  fellowships  and  scholarships  support  an  average
of  2,200  students  each  year  of  which  21  percent  are  under-represented  mi-
norities  and  43  percent  are  women;  the  research  component  involves  over
5,000  students  each  year;  and,  the  higher  education  component  involves  over
20,000 students each year.
• Faculty  Competitiveness:  The  research  infrastructure  building  effort  contrib-
utes  to  the  development  of  faculty  through  the  travel  grants,  seed  research
grants,  release  time,  and  research  collaborations  with  NASA  Centers  and  in-
dustry.
• Pre-service  Education:  The  pre-college  efforts  focus  on  enhancing  the  knowl-
edge  of  students  and  teachers  through  teacher  preparation  and  development,
curriculum development informed by NASA content, and dissemination activi-
ties.
• Student  Research:  The  fellowships  and  scholarships  emphasize  student  in-
ternships and research experiences and mentoring components, with consortia
reporting an average of 1,500 collaborative efforts each year with NASA Cen-
ters and with industry.
• Under-represented and Under-served Participation: 20 percent of the over 550
academic  affiliate  organizations  are  minority-serving  institutions.  Addition-
ally,  over  20  percent  of  the  Space  Grant  fellowships  and  scholarships  are
awarded to under-represented minorities.
• Elementary  and  Secondary  Participation:  The  pre-college  component  places
an emphasis on teacher preparation and development. Each consortium is di-
rected  to  align  pre-college  components  with  the  state’s  STEM  standards  and
existing state systemic reform efforts.
• Informal  Education:  The  public  service  component  emphasizes  promoting  an
understanding  of  STEM  disciplines  through  the  dissemination  of  NASA  con-
tent (materials and information), and the stimulation of an interest in STEM
disciplines and the NASA mission through public service activities.

We  look  forward  to  sustaining  this  program  with  a  focus  on  alignment  to  NASA
strategic education outcomes in the areas of workforce, pipeline, and public benefit.

With our increased emphasis on partnerships and alliance, we value the many now
long-standing  affiliations,  which  have  developed  through  Space  Grant  over  the  last
18 years and look to build on those relationships.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It  is  not  necessary  that  I  be  happy.  It  is  probably  not  possible
when  I  hear  all  of  these  suggestions  that  we  are  going  to  have  28
or 38 missions by 2030, or even talk about our new vehicle by 2010.
I think about George Burns, at the age of 100, saying he didn’t buy
green  bananas.  So  I  don’t  think  it  is  going  to  happen  really  quick,
but I am glad to see you with your hand on the throttle. And we—
a  lot  of  us  are  very  happy  to  see  him  reach  down  into  the  maze
of  men  and  women  that  could  be  considered  for  this  to  see  you
come up with it. I am not sure you are going to make it, but I am
pretty  sure  that  I  am  going  to  be  trying  to  help  you  and  support
you.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir.
Mr. HALL. And Congressman Rohrabacher referred to you as the
man  from  La  Mancha.  I  guess  the  areas  that  you  are  battling  are
real,  however.  We  know  they  are,  and  the  results  are  consequen-
tial,  rather  than  comical.  You  have  a  lot  of  work  to  do  and  some
very difficult things to change. I just—you have—you know, for one
thing,  the  trip  to  Mars,  you  are  faced  with  the  Will  Rogers  look-
alikes  throughout  this  country  who  say  they  are  less  interested  in
going to Mars than they are of being able to make a trip to the gro-
cery store. And that is a pretty—thing that most people can relate
to, but the hard and cold facts are we need to go to Mars. We have
to  go  to  Mars  for  a  lot  of  reasons.  And  this  group—these—we—it
is  obvious  that  we  are  aware  of  those  reasons  and  are  pretty  sup-
portive of them.

We  know  that  NASA  wrestles  with  all  of  these  thorny  issues,
that  we  have  got  to  move  ahead  with  authorizing  legislation  to
keep  you  going.  And  the  bill  that  Chairman  Calvert  and  I  intro-
duced just yesterday, I think, provides a framework for moving for-
ward  and  ensuring  that  Congress  has  the  information  it  needs  to
make  a  more  detailed  policy  because  in  years  ahead  you  are  going
to have to make and be having to lead.

I  think  that  on  safety—this  hasn’t  been  talked  about  very  much
here today, but I know it is on everyone’s mind. We—as you know,
we had $15 million set aside. We had requested that and had been
set  aside  to  study  for  the  future  safety  of  the  astronauts  them-
selves,  and  I  understand  that  you  all  have  handled  that  and  that
you—that  either  under  the  previous  Administration,  or  your  Ad-
ministration,  have  been  working  for  safety  with  full  plating  with
the  hulls  of  some  of  the  birds  we  have  and  space  suits  and  other
survival  equipment,  that  that  has  been  wrapped  into  that  and
going  in  the  future  planning  that  I  have  asked  you  about  so  many
times. So you know pretty well, and because it is still a fragile mis-
sion,  you  know  the  reason  I  am  asking  them,  and  you  know  the
question I am going to ask, and you can just answer it without me
asking  it,  but  to  make  it  a  little  easier  for  you,  I  would  like  to  get
it on record. This is your first appearance here, official appearance
here, as the Administrator. You have been here many times before,
but you know I am concerned, as we all are, about crew safety, and

I  know  that  you  have  down-selected  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
to two contractor teams, is that correct?

Dr. GRIFFIN. That is correct, sir.
Mr.  HALL.  And  in  their  proposals,  did  they  address  crew  safety
as an issue? And if so, how? And if not, will this be included in fu-
ture iterations of these contracts themselves?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Oh,  crew  safety  has  been  addressed,  and  as  we  go
forward  to  a  further  down-select  early  next  year  to  a  single  con-
tractor to build the CEV, we will absolutely make certain that crew
safety is a top priority.

Mr. HALL. But you are underway, and you are of record, and you

are giving leadership in that thrust?

Dr. GRIFFIN. In every possible way that I can, sir.
Mr.  HALL.  Because  wouldn’t  you  hate  to  be  Administrator,  and
would we hate to be Members of Congress, if we had another trag-
edy  and  we  weren’t  already  traveling  that  road  to  get  that  type  of
operative procedure for our future astronauts?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Sir, we are endeavoring with our plans and designs
for the new Crew Exploration Vehicle to make it as safe as we can,
as simple as we can, and have it as soon as we can.

Mr.  HALL.  Until  2010,  and  then  have  the  module  in  that  bird

that would be an escape vehicle.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, we would hope there would be an escape sys-

tem for launch aborts and things like that. Yes, there will be.

Mr. HALL. I thank you. And I thank you for what you have done.
And  I  thank  you  for  the  way  you  are  doing  it.  And  I  admire  you
for the way you are doing it.

I yield back my time.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman yields back four seconds.
Mr. Green.
Mr. HALL. Well, let me finish then.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Green.
Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  I  also  thank  you,  as  well  as  the  Ranking  Member,  for  this
opportunity  to  visit  with  our  outstanding  head  of  our  space  pro-
gram.

I  will  tell  you,  sir,  that  as  you  sit  there  alone,  that  table  looks
very large. Normally, we have several people there at the table, but
it appears to me that you are up to the task, and I compliment you.
I  would  like  to  segue  from  Congressman  Hall’s  comments  about
crew  safety  to  another  area  of  crew  safety.  It  is  my  understanding
that  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  gave  us  15  rec-
ommendations that were to be adhered to, or should be adhered to
before  we  return  to  space  flight.  I  understand  that  12  of  the  15
have  been  met,  but  we  have  three  that  are  outstanding.  Those
three  include  the  debris  issue,  which  was  a  key  issue  with  ref-
erence  to  the  demise  of  Columbia,  repair  tools,  and  repair  tech-
niques.  Mr.  Bill  Parsons  has  said  that  the  space—return  to  space
right now bears an acceptable risk. And my question has to do with
this  term  ‘‘acceptable  risk’’,  given  that  we  still  have  the  debris
issue,  we  still  have  the  repair  tools  and  repair  techniques,  and  we
are  looking  at  a  launch  window  of  possibly  early  July,  July  13

through July 31. Will you please comment on the term ‘‘acceptable
risk’’?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir. I believe that Mr. Parsons was commenting
on  the  acceptable  risk  of  returning  the  Shuttle  to  flight  in  terms
of the corrections and improvements that have been made after the
loss  of  Columbia  to  address  the  causes  of  that  loss.  Now  I  have—
as  I  said  earlier,  I  have  participated  in  every  significant  technical
review  that  has  been  held  on  this  topic  since  I  was  nominated  to
this office.

Let me give you my assessment, if I might.
We  have—and  our  independent  advisors  from  outside  have
agreed,  we  have  tremendously  reduced—we  believe  that  we  have
tremendously  reduced  the  amount  of  debris,  which  is  shed,  or  will
be shed, by the external tank on this next Shuttle mission, as com-
pared  to  all  prior  Shuttle  missions.  Now  we  believe  that.  This  is
a  test  flight.  These  next  two  flights  are  test  flights.  It  needs  to  be
fully understood that they carry the risk of test flights, because we
cannot—we simply do not have the capability to assess the efficacy
of  our  improvement  without  returning  to  flight.  But  we  believe  it
is much improved.

So  when  we  say  ‘‘acceptable  risk’’,  we  mean  that  the  risk  of  an
accident  due  to  debris,  which  was  the  approximate  cause  of  the
Shuttle  Columbia  loss,  has  been  reduced  to  a  level  that  is  con-
sistent  with  other  risks  associated  with  the  Shuttle  space  flight
system. And there are many.

Mr.  GREEN.  Just  as  a  quick  follow-up,  will  we  have  repair  tools

and repair techniques available to us prior to the next launch?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  No,  sir,  we  will  not.  We—those  three  recommenda-
tions  in  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board’s  report  were,
of  course,  well  intended  and  serve  as  admirable  goals.  The  ideal
state  would  be  to  have  no  debris  coming  from  the  tank.  We  have
not been able to achieve that. The ideal state would be to have re-
pair  tools  and  repair  techniques,  which  could  deal  with  a  flaw  in
the  tile,  the  Shuttle’s  entry  heat  system,  heat  protection  system
once we are on orbit. We don’t know how to do that. We have spent
quite  a  lot  of  money  on  it.  Some  have  estimated  hundreds  of  mil-
lions  of  dollars  trying  to  comply  with  that  recommendation.  We
don’t know how to do it. So at this point, we must say that we have
reduced  the  level  of  risk  due  to  debris  damage  to  an  acceptable
level, in Mr. Parsons’ words the other day, or we must say that we
don’t want to fly the Shuttle again because we do not have a better
technical approach to dealing with it than the one we have put for-
ward.

Mr.  GREEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  yield  back  the  balance

of my time.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you. You are generous: two seconds.
Mr.  Administrator,  when  you  say  ‘‘debris,’’  are  we  talking  foam

now or foam and ice?

Dr. GRIFFIN. Broadly speaking, foam and ice. If you wish to make
it more specific, then I—everything that I have learned in the past
two  and  one-half  months  causes  me  to  believe  that  we  have  re-
duced  the  risk  of  damage  from  foam  debris  to  a  negligible  level.
Okay.  That  will  not  be  a  factor.  And  again,  we  cannot  back  that
assertion  up  without  a  test  flight,  but  we  are  going  into  the  flight

of STS–114 with the belief that foam debris risk is not a significant
factor.

Chairman BOEHLERT. What about the risk of ice?
Dr. GRIFFIN. We have greatly reduced the risk of damage by fall-
ing  ice,  in  particular  by  putting  a  feedline—a  heater  on  the  locks,
forward  locks  feedline  bellows.  There  are  other  spots  on  the  exter-
nal  tank  and  its  propulsion  system  where  ice  can  accumulate  and
from  which  it  can  be  liberated  and  strike  the  orbiter.  We  believe
that  risk  is  minimal.  Well,  we  believe  it  is  well  less  than  one  in
100 based on our analyses, but it is not zero. And——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  But  it  would  lead  you  to  conclude  the  ac-

ceptable risk?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  The—we  have  concluded  that  it  is  an  acceptable
risk  in  comparison  to  other  risks,  which  we  assume  when  we  fly
the Shuttle.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Administrator.
Mr. Sodrel.
Mr.  SODREL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you,  Admin-

istrator Griffin, for being here this morning.

I  know  there  are  various  kinds  of  risks  to  astronauts.  One  cer-
tainly  is  trauma,  which  the  question  has  been  asked  here.  The
other is longer-term. I have got an e-mail here I would like to read
to you from a constituent in my District and ask your comment.

It  says  in  order  to  ensure  the  safe  return  of  astronauts  from  ex-
ploration missions, we must have effective countermeasures and an
autonomous support system. This requires an aggressive basic and
applied  research  program  in  flight  aboard  the  International  Space
Station and on the ground. It is particularly compelling because the
countermeasures  that  are  available  today  will  not  adequately  pro-
tect our astronauts. In fact, I understand the longest—that the as-
tronauts that spent the longest time in orbit experienced both mus-
cle  deterioration  and  loss  of  bone  density.  But  anyway,  it  says,  in
short,  that  we  must  maintain  orbital  science  and  grant  research
and apply them directly to exploration missions. I wonder if it had
had any significant impacts on space life scientists has been the de-
nying  of  funding  of  proposed  research  that  received  high  acclaim
and peer review. We scientists believe the values and principles en-
compassed  within  peer  review.  The  process  needs  to  be  upheld  by
all research agencies, including NASA.

So  I  guess  first,  my  first  question  is  how  much  weight  is  given
to peer review? And the second part is what are we doing with re-
gard to protecting the astronauts long-term?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  with  regard  to  the  role  of  peer  review  in  se-
lecting  science  experiments,  it  remains  unchanged  within  NASA
and  absolutely  follows  the  guidelines  that  your  constituent  is  sug-
gesting. However, the purpose of peer review is to determine which
experiments,  in  comparison  to  other  suggestions,  are  worth  doing
and  ultimately  to  help  us  with  prioritizing  our  overall  research
agenda.  But  there  will  always  be  more  good  ideas  that  could  be
suggested for funding and would pass the peer review process than
we  have  the  budget  to  support.  And  so  at  some  point,  there  must
be a cut-line established below which we simply can’t afford to fund
those priorities.

Now that does not make them without a value, but it does mean
that  we  don’t  have  the  money  to  support  them.  We  must  choose.
We must choose whether minimizing a strategically significant gap
in  space  access  to  the  United  States  is  more  important  or  less  im-
portant  than  doing  the  kind  of  research  of  which,  you  know,  your
constituent speaks.

I have been very clear in my choice that the most important pri-
ority  facing  us,  as  we  conduct  our  program  of  human  space  flight,
is  to  fly  the  Shuttle  safely.  The  next  most  important  thing  is  to
bring  online  its  replacement.  It,  in  my  view,  serves  no  purpose  to
conduct  even  very  high  quality  research  into  human  space  life
sciences  unless  we  are  flying  humans.  And  if  we  have  a  long  and
strategically  significant  gap  in  such  human  space  flights,  I  think
we  have  got  the  priority  order  in  the  wrong  way.  But  with  all  due
respect  to  your  constituent,  I  do  understand  the  priority  choices,
which must be made, and I have made mine.

Mr.  SODREL.  So  you  feel  like  we  are  doing  enough  to  protect  the

astronauts in the long-term, as well as the short-term?

Dr. GRIFFIN. I believe we must eventually do more to protect as-
tronauts  in  the  long-term,  but  at  present,  we  are  not  conducting
long-term flights.

Mr. SODREL. Thank you.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Johnson.
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE

STATION

I apologize for being late. I had an engagement I couldn’t change,
and  I  might  have  missed  a  great  deal  of  your  testimony,  but  wel-
come,  and  I  read  about  your  beginning.  And  I  would  like  to—well,
over the years, I have touted the space program as being one of the
most  successful  research  programs  in  our  history  with  both  treat-
ment and commercial items.

What did we learn from the International Space Station?
Dr. GRIFFIN. Well, ma’am, that is a very broad question. We have
learned much from the International Space Station so far and have
a  significant  amount  to  go.  Some  specific  things  that  we  have
learned,  I  have  often  said  that  one  of  the  best  benefits  of  the  pro-
gram  has  been  the  enduring  quality  of  the  international  partner-
ship which has developed. We have learned to work with other na-
tions in space and to find ways to resolve differences and make the
program  work.  We  have  learned  a  tremendous  amount  about  as-
sembling  and  integrating  large  structures  in  space  and  sustaining
them  for  years  at  a  time,  frankly,  through  some  pretty  severe  dif-
ficulties following the loss of Columbia. It is the goal of this Admin-
istration, it is my goal, to put us on the path to a lunar return and
the establishment of a lunar outpost and missions to Mars. We will
not be able to execute those missions without learning how to sus-
tain  operations  in  space  for  months  and  years  at  a  time,  and  a
place where we can learn to do that is the Space Station.

WORKFORCE

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Thank  you.  A  year  ago,  as  we  were  listening  to
testimony,  one  of  the  urgent  things  was  making  sure  that  we  had
the  talent  in-house,  the  numbers  available  to  do  the  work.  Have—
and  I  noticed  you  have  gotten  rid  of  a  lot  of  people.  Have  you
brought new ones on?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Ma’am,  we  haven’t  gotten  rid  of  a  lot  of  people.  I
am not sure we have gotten rid of anyone. I have reassigned some
senior managers from existing roles in the Agency, or will be reas-
signing them, to other roles within the Agency, if they choose to ac-
cept  those  roles.  I  am  in  the  process  of  assembling  a  management
team  that  I  feel  I  can  most  efficaciously  work  with  as  we  go  for-
ward,  as  I  think  you  would  expect  of  any  senior  manager.  We  are
looking very closely across the Agency at how we preserve the core
competencies that we need within the government.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  You  have  ended  your  associations  primarily  with
private  industry  as  well  as  universities,  and  most  especially  with
universities.  I  thought  we  were  attempting  to  attract  and  prepare
staff  for  the  future.  What  was  the  rationale  for  that?  I  know  you
said you want to do it in-house, but I am just trying to——

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Ma’am,  we  have  not  ended  our  associations  with
universities and private industry by any stretch of the imagination.
Eighty  percent,  or  more,  of  NASA’s  budget  is  outsourced  and  will
continue to be so.

Ms. JOHNSON. Okay. I am reading the wrong material.
When  you  go  to—what—I  understand  that  the—in  getting  to
Mars,  it  is  going  to  be  a  journey,  so  it  is  going  to  probably  take  a
while. What do we need to do before you start to go to—other than
raise  a  lot  of  money,  what—you  are  going  to  use  what  you  have
learned  from  the  International  Space  Station.  What  else  do  we
need to do, and what are we looking for?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  We  need  to  develop  a  replacement  for  the  Shuttle,
which  is  capable  of  flying  to  the  Moon  and  later  on  to  Mars.  We
need  to  develop—to  redevelop  a  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle,  some-
thing  in  the  100  metric  ton  class.  We  need  to  gain  broad  oper-
ational  experience  going  to  and  living  on  the  Moon  for  significant
periods  of  time  before  it  would  be  wise,  in  my  opinion,  to  take  the
step to Mars. We need to develop space nuclear power and propul-
sion  systems  in  order  that  we  can  go  to  Mars  and  remain  there  in
effective ways.

Ms. JOHNSON. Do you feel——
Dr. GRIFFIN. Those are the broad categories of things that I think

are important.

Ms. JOHNSON. Okay. Do you feel that you have now—or you have

your eye on the appropriate skills to bring in-house for that?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Yes,  ma’am,  I  do.  I  think  NASA  has  most  of  the
critical  skills  it  needs  to  acquire  and  maintain  in  order  to  execute
this  mission,  and  where  we  don’t  have  them,  we  know  what  to  do
to get them.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentlelady’s time has expired.
Ms.  JOHNSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  appreciate  it,  Mr.  Chair-

man. Good luck, and I will try to be of support.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you.

MANNED SPACE FLIGHT VS. UNMANNED SPACE FLIGHT

Dr.  Griffin,  it  is  an  honor  to  have  you  here  today.  You  certainly
have  a  challenge  in  front  of  you  that  I  agree  with  the  Committee.
You are doing a great job getting started, and I wish you well.

I  have  about  15,000  NASA  employees  and  contractors  on  the
Houston  end  of  my  District.  I  have  been  through  the  Johnson
Space Center. It is very impressive. Most of the questions have al-
ready  been  asked,  but  I  do  want  to  ask  a  more  fundamental  ques-
tion,  and  that  is  I  support  the  President  and  his  vision,  space  ex-
ploration  to  the  Moon  and  Mars  and  beyond.  But  there  are  those
critics who say that we shouldn’t take the risk and that we should
do  that  with  unmanned  vehicles.  And  I  was  hoping  that  you  could
possibly articulate or advocate why it is important for us to engage
and  have  manned  space  flights  to  the  Moon  and  Mars  and  beyond
as opposed to unmanned space flights.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Well,  sir,  I  think  both  are  important,  and  I  have
spent significant portions of my career in both pursuits. But let me
answer your question as to why I believe it is important.

I believe that if the United States is to be the world’s preeminent
nation going forward in the 21st century and the centuries beyond,
that  it  must  be  preeminent  in  space,  exactly  as  was  the  case  cen-
turies  ago  when  small  island  nations  or  other  small  nations,  such
as  Britain,  Portugal,  had  dominant  roles  in  the  global  structure  of
their day because of their maritime preeminence.

Space  is—mastery  of  the  art  of  space  flight,  both  human  and
robotic, is the most important thing that America can do to assure
that  we  will  always  be  a  great  nation,  in  my  opinion.  When  one
looks at that, there are broad regimes of activity. There are activi-
ties  that  we  undertake  today  in  low-Earth  orbit,  both  human  and
robotic, and they are very significant.

Beyond  low-Earth  orbit,  the  next  places  that  we  can  go  are  the
Moon,  Mars,  and  the  near-Earth  asteroids.  If  we  don’t  go  there,
eventually  other  nations  will,  and  eventually  may  not  be  too  long.
I  have  pointed  out  in  other  testimony  that  since  we  last  flew  our
own  people  in  space  on  our  own  machines,  two  other  nations  have
done  so.  I  do  not  find  that  acceptable.  Space  will  be  explored  and
exploited  by  humans.  The  question  is  which  humans  from  where
and  what  language  will  they  speak.  It  is  my  goal  that  Americans
will be always among them.

Mr. MCCAUL. I thank you for your eloquent testimony.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Welcome,  Dr.  Griffin.  It  is  a  pleasure  to  en-
gage you, and I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for
this  very  crucial  hearing.  I  hope  we  will  have  an  opportunity,  as
I  might  imagine  you  would  like,  for  members  to  engage  on  a  reg-
ular  basis.  I,  frankly,  believe  that  we  have  to  be  a  team  if  we  are
going to be successful.

I  consider  the  astronauts  brave  and  patriotic  Americans  willing
to risk their lives on behalf of American excellence and at the direc-

tions  of  the  Commander  in  Chief.  I  don’t  believe  one  astronaut
would  tell  you  that  they  are  not  willing  to  accept  this  mission  or
any  other  mission.  And  that  is  why  I  believe  it  is  crucial  for  the
executive, in this instance, you, but even more crucial for this body,
which is considered part of the people’s house, closest to the people
of the United States, to be diligent, technically and philosophically,
on  this  question  of  space  exploration.  Now  I  happen  to  be  a  very
strong supporter of human space exploration, including the mission
to  the  Moon.  But  at  the  same  time,  my  neighbors  are  astronauts.
My neighbors are the Johnson Space Center. My neighbor was Ron
McNair, who attended church in my Congressional District, and his
wife,  a  friend,  and  still  a  very  zealous  and  wonderful  supporter  of
NASA’s mission.

So  I  pointedly  ask  a  number  of  questions  that  you  have  already
asked  and  answered,  and  I  have  reviewed  your  testimony,  and  I,
too, apologize for being at another meeting. But I do want to probe
more  extensively  your  very  forthright  recognition  that  we  don’t
have the tools or the techniques that we would totally like to have
as  it  relates  to  space  debris,  and  I  think  space  debris  is  anything.
It  is  the  foam,  or  as  I  understand,  any  amount  of  debris  that  you
encounter  in  going  into  space.  Can  you  calculate—this  question
has—might be considered asked and answered, but I think we need
to  hear  it  more  times  than  not,  where  you  place  this  risk,  this  ac-
ceptable  risk,  as  compared  to  the  advantages  or  the  importance  of
space  exploration.  Might  you  also  give  us  the  vision  of  the  NASA
Administration  and  the  President  of  the  extent  of  human  involve-
ment  in  the  space  exportation  in  the  mission  to  the  Moon  and  the
presence  of  humans  on  the  Moon,  the  advantage  of  their  presence
on  the  Moon?  I  am  trying  to  give  you  a  series  of  questions  so  that
you can answer them.

The other point that I want to acknowledge, and I think I under-
stand this, I want to applaud the bringing in-house of technical and
planning  and  strategic  decisions  for  NASA,  meaning  that  you  are
looking  for  the  world’s  best  scientists,  the  Nation’s  best  scientists
in  dealing  with  decisions  in-house,  and  I  think  that  is  absolutely
imperative.  One  of  the  questions—one  of  what  I  glean  from  the
Gehman  Administration  is  the  line  of  command.  Who  was  telling
whom  to  do  what?  Can  you  tell  me,  is  that  where  you  are  trying
to go to make sure that strategic decisions, whether it is on safety
or otherwise, are within the bounds of NASA? And if you are going
that direction, I am with you.

Let me conclude in this direction.
I hope that you will join us and encourage this committee to hold
a full, extensive hearing on the question of safety. And I am going
to  ask  you.  I  would  like  you  to  just  answer  that  yes  or  no  in  your
answers,  of  the  importance  of  this  committee  having  oversight,
being an investigatory mold to be helpful on the question of safety,
safety  on  human  space  shuttle,  but  safety  as  well  in  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station,  which  I  think  is  extremely  important  as  a
scientific tool for what it has done for America.

And lastly, this question of training in-house. I hope that we can
work  together  on  our  Hispanic-serving  and  historically  black  col-

rected toward your institution who happen to be from the minority
community.

And  I  thank  you  for  your  presence,  and  I  hope  you  can  summa-

rize my questions.

Dr. GRIFFIN. I will try. Thank you.

DEBRIS HAZARDS

With regard to debris hazards and being all encompassing with—
in  our  definition  of  debris  whether  it  is  on  ascent  or  while  we  are
on  orbit,  yes,  you  are  right.  Orbital  debris  might—what  we  call
MMOD  for  micrometeroid  and  orbital  debris  hazard,  is  one  of  the
more  significant  hazards  to  space  flight  in  the  Shuttle.  And  when
I spoke earlier of reducing our ascent debris hazard down to a level
consistent  with  other  risks,  this  was  one  of  the  other  risks.  Going
forward, in order to make space flight as safe as possible, the best
thing  we  can  do  is  to  continue  with  the  protocols  we  are  already
implementing  regarding  minimizing—absolutely  minimizing  the
generation of new orbital debris. And then the other factor is in the
replacement  vehicle  for  the  Shuttle,  the  CEV,  we  must  have  a  de-
sign which is, as much as possible, robust in the face of orbital de-
bris, and that is a significant concern that I have.

THE VALUE OF HUMANS ON THE MOON

Now  humans  on  the  Moon  I  think  is  quite  significant.  I  have
never  heard  it  put  better  than  Norm  Augustine  in  his  report  in
1990  where  he  pointed  out  that  an  instrumented  payload  on  the
top  of  Mount  Everest  simply  did  not  have  the  same  value  as
Tenzing and Hillary ascending that mountain. Others have tried to
come  up  with  similar  approaches,  but  I  think  Mr.  Augustine  put
it  best.  The  value  of  humans  on  the  Moon  is  the  value  that  we
bring  anywhere  we  go.  The  ability  to  make  broad  judgments,  to
make big picture assessments, to decide what details are important
and what ones are not important so that we can deploy our robotic
assistance on the proper tasks.

STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING

With  regard  to  our  strategic  decision-making  in  NASA,  yes,  we
are  refining  our—in  fact,  our—what  we  call  our  strategic  manage-
ment  handbook,  as  I  speak,  trying  to  simplify  our  chain  of  com-
mand and make our decision processes more transparent and more
specific.

If you decide to hold a hearing on safety of space flight, whether
Shuttle or International Space Station, you may count on me to be
a  strong  supporter  of  that  hearing,  and  I  look  forward  to  working
with you on it.

THE ROLE OF HBCS

Regarding  the  development  of  in-house  capability  for  our  sci-
entific and engineering staff, I welcome, with open arms, efforts to
engage  Hispanic  or  historically  black  colleges  and  universities,  as
I do all of our colleges and universities. We are, as a nation, facing
a crisis, clear and documented in our ability to entice young people

to  embark  on  careers—on  technical  careers:  science,  mathematics,
engineering,  all  branches  of  those.  Our—in  many  cases,  in  our
graduate institutions, foreign enrollment surpasses domestic enroll-
ment,  and  the  problem  is  that  they  go  back  home.  They  don’t  stay
here.  We  need  to  address  this.  I  have—I  could  not  more  strongly
support that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Feeney.
Mr. FEENEY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

LAUNCH VEHICLE DETERMINATION

And Dr. Griffin, I want to join the chorus of the members of the
Committee to welcome and congratulate you to the Administration
head  at  NASA.  I  have  been  very  impressed  by  your  background,
been  very  impressed  by  the  fact  that  you  hit  the  ground  running.
Even  though  you  came  from  the  outside,  you  had  in  your  mind  a
very  visionary  way  of  taking  a  complete  inventory  of  NASA’s  re-
sources  and  capabilities  and  opportunities  and  challenges  long  be-
fore  you  were  appointed  by  President  Bush.  And  I  have  been,
frankly,  amazed  at  how  quickly,  dispensing  with  any  need  for  on-
the-job  training,  you  have  stepped  forward.  You  have  reorganized
both personnel and mission. You have made some very critical, de-
cisive  judgments  that  are  going  to  be  criticized  by  a  lot  of  us.  But
you  have  done  so  with  a  sort  of  confidence  and  the  level  of  exper-
tise  and  background  that  gives  me  confidence  that  we  are  exactly
doing what we need to be doing. And there are going to be 535 vi-
sions  for  NASA  in  Congress.  And  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  we  are
going  to  have  to  rely  on  you  to  bring  those  together  on  behalf  of
the people of the United States. And I have complete confidence in
your ability to do that job.

I was especially delighted to hear you say that priorities one and
two for your term involve human space flight, because, while there
are  lots  of  priorities  in  science,  microbiology  for  example,  as  men-
tioned earlier, all of these are important, but prioritizing is the job
that  you  have  to  do  and  the  budgetary  folks  have  to  do.  And  the
truth  of  the  matter  is,  there  are  a  lot  of  places  that  can  do  re-
search.  There  are  a  lot  of  universities.  There  are  a  lot  of  founda-
tions.  There  are  a  lot  of  private  sector  folks,  but  there  is  only  one
place  that  can  move  Americans  into  low,  middle,  and  high-Earth
orbit and to explore the solar system, and for now, that is the Fed-
eral Government.

I join Dana Rohrabacher and others in hoping that, with respect
to  low-Earth  orbit,  NASA  gets  out  of  the  business  pretty  quickly.
We  have  commercial-viable  options  that  can  do  that.  But  for  now,
return to the International Space Station by the Shuttle and then,
number  two,  the  CEV  are  clearly,  in  my  view,  the  most  important
priorities, and you have got them right. And I congratulate you.

With  respect  to  the  new  CEV,  and  by  the  way  I  want  to  thank
you  for  trying  to  find  a  way  to  shorten  the  window.  The  original
proposal talked about a window from 2010 to 2014 where we would
have no capability as a Nation to send humans into space. And you
determined  what  that  CEV  ought  to  look  like,  and  you  have  to  se-
lect the type of vehicles for launch. The CEV is an important thing
to  design,  as  Ralph  Hall  talks  about,  in  a  safe  way,  the  heavy-lift

obligation  for,  not  just  people,  but  equipment,  the  supplies  needed
to  go  to  the  Moon  and  potentially  to  Mars  someday,  the  ability  to
go  back  and  forth  to  the  Shuttle.  For  reasons  of  safety,  reliability,
scheduled  costs,  the  development  of  the  Shuttle-derived  vehicles,  I
think, had some real opportunities, and you have expressed a clear
preference for those Shuttle-derived launch vehicles.

On  the  other  hand,  back  in  December,  you  had  the  President’s
space  transportation  policy,  which  had  a  presumption,  as  I  under-
stand it, in favor of the use of the evolved expendable launch vehi-
cles.  I  wonder  if  you  could  tell  us  how  those  presumptions,  yours
versus the transportation policy organization, how you expect them
to  be  resolved,  who  you  expect  to  be  involved  in  the  decision-mak-
ing,  what  sort  of  considerations  ought  to  be  a  factor  into  that,  and
also,  what  sort  of  capabilities  we  want  the  CEV  to  have  that  may
combine  the  usage,  ultimately,  of  both  the  EELV  and  the  Shuttle-
derived opportunities.

Dr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, sir.
Let me answer the last question first, I think.
We  have,  within  NASA,  looked  extensively  at  all  of  the  means
that we might bring to bare for the two major—or I would say the
three  major  categories  of  things  that  we  launch.  And  those  three
categories are science missions, which go on expendable launch ve-
hicles,  and  then  we  will  be  requiring  a  Shuttle  replacement,  the
CEV and its associated launch system. And then finally to go to the
Moon,  as  I  have  indicated  before,  we  need  capability  in  the  100
metric ton class.

I am, of course, aware of the space transportation policy that you
mentioned. The—I don’t believe that that transportation policy cre-
ates  a  presumption  of  the  use  of  one  system  or  another.  What  it
requires NASA and the DOD to do is to coordinate on their require-
ments in an effort to achieve the most efficacious——

Mr. FEENEY. If I may interrupt.
Dr. GRIFFIN. Yes, sir.
Mr.  FEENEY.  DOD  has  a  presumption  here  at  a  minimum,  don’t

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  have  not  yet  had  an  opportunity—I  have  spoken
with  General  Lord,  head  of  U.S.  Space  Command,  and  General
Lord was quite clear that he understands and agrees with my stat-
ed  preference  of—for  NASA  to  pursue  a  Shuttle-derived  solution.
He  would  like  us  to  launch  our  expendable  vehicle  traffic  on  DOD
systems as much as possible, and with that, we concur. NASA has
no  desire  to  spend  extra  money  developing  systems  that  already
exist.  But  where  systems  don’t  exist,  then  we  need  to  look  at  the
lowest cost and highest reliability, safest path forward, and that is
what we are doing.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The Chair would like to recognize the ever

they?

patient Dr. Schwarz.

Here is the situation on the Floor. We have a series of votes, and
they are eight minutes and 46 seconds to go. Dr. Schwarz, you will
get your two cents in, and——

Mr. SCHWARZ. How about 46 seconds worth?
Chairman BOEHLERT. All right. Go to it.

U.S. PREEMINENCE IN SPACE

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Okay.  This  is  a—just  lob  a  softball  up  there,  but
I  think  people  would  like  to  know,  as  we  talk  about  other  nations
and  consortia  who  have  programs,  perhaps  not  as  ambitious  as
ours  to  go  to  a  Jovian  moon,  but  other  programs,  what  are  the
other  countries  and  other  consortia  who  you  would  consider  our
competition  in  these  enterprises,  because  I  think  that  is  not  com-
monly  known,  and  people  should  know  who  the  competition  is  out
there  and  why  we,  perhaps,  if  not  have  fallen  behind,  have  fallen
back from our previous lead?

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  Yes,  sir.  We—the  United  States  has  partners  in  its
space  endeavors,  and  it  has  competitors.  And  in  many  cases,  just
as  in  industry,  the  partners  and  competitors  are  the  same  people.
We ally or we compete on different ventures, according to what we
perceive  our  needs  to  be.  Our  chief  competitors  for  preeminence  in
space  are  Russia,  the  European  Space  Agency,  the  Chinese,  who
are  coming  along  quite  nicely,  and  the  Indian  Space  Agency  is
making strong initiatives. We partner with any and all of those na-
tions in various venues, and I expect that to continue in the future.
But  we  also  compete  with  them.  And  it  is,  again,  my  goal  to  see
to  it  that  America  is  always  in  the  lead  in  that  competition.  That
matters greatly to me.

Dr. SCHWARZ. Thank you, Dr. Griffin.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  And  Mr.  Administrator,  we
want to help you achieve that goal. Let me say, in your maiden ap-
pearance  before  this  committee  as  Administrator,  you  have  ap-
peared  many,  many  times  before  and  have  been  an  invaluable  re-
source  to  us,  quite  successful.  I  appreciate  the  candor  of  your  re-
sponses  to  the  many  questions.  I  appreciate  your  trying  to  give  us
some guidance as to when we might expect further answers to spe-
cific  questions.  I  think  it  has  been  a  very  productive  hearing.  I
hope  you  share  that  view.  We  are  partners  in  this  endeavor.  We
want to make it work.

Dr.  GRIFFIN.  I  do  share  that  view,  sir.  If  I  could  just  have  one

more moment.

We  need  your  help.  We  do  need  to  work  together.  We  need  the
help  of  this  committee  and  this  Congress  in  carrying  out  our  mis-
sion. We need your help with an authorization request and with re-
lief  on  the  Iran  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Act,  pardon  me.  We  can-
not be successful without you, and we know that.

So thank you for having me here today.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Of the cynic society, I just want to tell you,

we are from the Congress. We are here to help.

This meeting is adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Michael D. Griffin, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Ad-

ministration

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Do  you  intend  to  pursue  competitive  procurements  for  all  of  the  required  ele-
ments  of  the  exploration  program,  or  are  you  planning  to  use  sole-source  agree-
ments  or  other  non-competitive  means  for  some  of  the  elements?  If  the  latter,
which elements will not be competitively procured?

A1. We  anticipate  full  and  open  competition  on  all  the  elements  of  the  exploration
program  except  where  competition  may  not  be  safe  or  feasible.  In  those  cases,  we
will  utilize  sole-source  agreements  as  necessary.  Final  decisions  will  be  part  of  for-
mal Acquisition Strategy Meetings.

Currently, the only sole-source procurement we are planning involves those parts
of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) that are derived from existing Shuttle hardware.
Also, we plan to use in-house capabilities extensively to develop technologies for the
Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and lunar sortie missions.

Competitions are currently planned for the CEV, the CLV Upper Stage, and crew
and cargo services to and from the International Space Station. The CEV currently
has two contractors in phase 1 of a two-phase program with a competitive down se-
lect scheduled for spring 2006.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  Acquisition  Strategy  for  the  Constellation  Program  is
still a work-in-progress and details could change, but this reflects our current base-
line.
Q2. What  exploration  capabilities  do  you  intend  to  develop  in-house  at  NASA,  and
which ones do you plan to have industry develop? How did you go about making
those decisions?

A2. NASA  considers  many  factors  when  determining  which  tasks  will  be  retained
in  the  Agency  and  which  will  be  performed  by  contractors.  These  factors  include
criticality  to  fulfilling  the  Vision,  available  Agency  workforce,  existing  talent  pools,
future developments in the marketplace, and budget and schedule concerns. The ca-
pabilities that we will keep ‘‘in-house’’ are those that are considered core NASA ca-
pabilities, such as Systems Engineering and Integration and many technology capa-
bilities as well. For example, the Liquid Oxygen, Liquid Methane engine will be de-
veloped primarily at NASA Centers, with NASA’s Glenn research center leading the
activity. This will be done to invigorate the technology capabilities at our NASA Re-
search Centers and to utilize our civil service work force.

We  will  go  to  industry  for  many  other  capabilities.  Goods  and  services  provided
by  industry  will  be  competitively  procured.  For  example,  NASA  will  work  in  part-
nership  with  a  contractor  team  to  develop  new  space  suit  capabilities  for  the  CEV
and lunar exploration vehicles.
Q3. Under what circumstances, if any, do you envision using U.S. funds to pay non-
U.S.  companies  or  organizations  for  exploration-related  technologies,  products,
or  services  instead  of  by  means  of  no-exchange-of-funds  cooperative  agreements
with non-U.S. space agencies?

A3. NASA will pursue opportunities to cooperate with its international partners, as
the President directed us to do in the Vision for Space Exploration. We plan to pur-
chase  transportation  services  from  our  partners  in  support  of  the  International
Space  Station  if  commercial  capabilities  are  not  available  when  needed.  We  are
seeking international cooperation on the lunar robotic precursor missions and poten-
tially  with  lunar  surface  systems  such  as  rovers,  habitats,  and  power,  systems  but
no firm plans or agreements are yet in place.

Under  the  U.S.  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations,  it  is  possible  that  foreign  firms
with unique capabilities could compete and win some NASA-sponsored contracts and
grants  for  exploration-related  activities.  In  such  cases,  NASA  would  first  explore
whether the proposed activities could be accomplished on a cooperative no-exchange
of  funds  basis  with  NASA’s  foreign  government  counterpart  as  an  alternative  to
funding a foreign firm.
Q4. You have talked about accelerating the Crew Exploration Vehicle [CEV] and its
launch vehicle, as well as starting development of a heavy lift booster to launch
cargo. How do you plan to reconcile those desires with the realities of the explo-
ration  program’s  current  five-year  budget  plan?  Are  you  prepared  to  defer  work
on  other  parts  of  the  exploration  initiative  to  accelerate  the  CEV  and  heavy  lift

booster? If so, what activities would you defer? Or would you get the money from
somewhere else? And if so, where?

A4. The Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) team has identified our ar-
chitecture for the development of the CEV, the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), and ini-
tial  lunar  landing  sorties.  To  meet  the  challenge  of  accelerating  the  CEV  and  all
of  its  associated  systems,  and  to  provide  adequate  resources  for  this  priority,
ESMD’s technology programs were carefully assessed as part of the Exploration Sys-
tems Architecture Study (ESAS). ESMD can currently afford this acceleration, with
no  new  funding  sources  from  outside  the  Directorate.  This  can  be  accomplished  by
shifting funds from lower-priority or longer-term technology needs, including a total
of  $785  million  in  FY  2006,  including  $292  million  reflected  in  the  FY  2006  budget
amendment and $493 million identified as a result of actions taken in the FY 2005
Operating  Plan  September  update.  We  have  been  able  to  shift  funding  from  Re-
search  and  Technology  projects  that  were  more  focused  on  future  capabilities  that
are  not  required  for  near-term  objectives.  For  example,  closed  loop  life  support  sys-
tems  funded  by  ESMD  have  been  deferred  in  the  near  term,  because  they  are  not
required  by  the  early  lunar  sortie  missions.  As  we  begin  to  focus  on  long-duration
lunar outposts, funding for closed-loop life support systems and other essential tech-
nology will be increased at the appropriate time to support those missions.
Q5. NASA  recently  decided  to  phase  out  the  involvement  of  the  consultant  Behavior
Sciences  Technology  (BST)  after  just  16  months  of  what  was  expected  to  be  a
three-year campaign. BST was brought in as a result of the findings in the Co-
lumbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) report that focused on the role that
the  NASA  culture  played  in  creating  the  environment  that  contributed  to  the
Shuttle accident.
• Why has the contract been canceled?
• Do  you  believe  that  no  more  work  is  needed  to  improve  the  NASA  culture?  If

so, why?

A5. The BST effort was reviewed by the Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation
in cooperation with the Office of Institutions and Management. Working in collabo-
ration, those offices defined the refocused effort that is being implemented after con-
sultation with the Office of the Administrator. We feel NASA has benefited from the
activities  involved  in  this  effort.  After  significant  experience  with  the  BST  contract
and  dedicated  work  at  several  field  centers,  we  decided  to  place  internal  focus  on
those parts of the BST culture change effort, which offered the most significant ben-
efits while curtailing other aspects.

While  we  did  find  many  aspects  of  the  BST  activities  to  be  beneficial,  there  was
never an expectation that culture could be fixed like a machine. Attention to safety
and strong internal communications is an on-going, continuous effort. NASA is dedi-
cated to pursue this effort in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Simi-
larly,  there  are  many  different  ways  we  can  improve  our  ability  to  consider  alter-
native  views  and  make  effective,  informed  decisions.  With  our  Strategic  Manage-
ment  Handbook,  we  are  setting  up  a  streamlined  set  of  Councils  that  will  facilitate
informed  decisions  by  senior  leaders.  The  leaders  and  members  of  the  councils  will
be responsible and accountable for those decisions. With the new Office of Program
Analysis and Evaluation, NASA is ensuring that there are internal checks and bal-
ances built into the decision-making process.
Q6. You  have  stated  your  firm  intention  to  terminate  the  Space  Shuttle  program  in

2010.

Q6a. How  do  you  respond  to  the  concern  that  setting  such  a  strict  deadline  creates
the  same  kind  of  schedule  pressure  that  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation
Board (CAIB) identified as a contributing factor to the Shuttle accident?

A6a. NASA  will  not  be  driven  by  schedule  pressure  to  fly  the  Shuttle  when  it  is
not ready to fly, even if that means fewer flights prior to retirement.
Q6b. Two alternatives to a hard deadline are (1) to firmly define how many Shuttle
launches are needed and then operate the Shuttle until those launches are com-
pleted—however  long  that  might  be;  or  (2)  to  operate  the  Shuttle  until  a  re-
placement means of crew transport has been developed. What do you see as the
pros and cons of each of these approaches?

A6b. NASA  conducted  a  study  to  re-evaluate  the  Space  Shuttle  mission  plans  for
completion  of  the  International  Space  Station  in  light  of  the  February  2004  Vision
for  Space  Exploration,  in  particular,  the  number  of  Shuttle  flights  required  by  FY
2010. The Station-Shuttle analysis has become the basis for the number of remain-

68

ing  flights  to  be  planned  for  the  Shuttle  program.  Shuttle  costs  exceed  $4  billion
per year to operate, and retiring the Shuttle is a key source of funds for developing
exploration  systems.  Extending  Shuttle  operations  for  a  finite  or  indefinite  period
would correspondingly defer exploration goals, given current resource constraints.

The Vision for Space Exploration calls for the Space Shuttle to be retired by 2010
with  its  primary  focus  being  to  complete  assembly  of  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion.  NASA  has  developed  a  proposed  plan  to  execute  this  mission  and  meet  our
international partner obligations using eighteen Space Shuttle flights over the next
five years.

NASA  is  also  pursuing  alternative  means  of  crew  and  cargo  access  to  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  in  the  post-Shuttle  era,  including  soliciting  crew  and  cargo
services from potential commercial providers. In addition, our international partners
have,  or  are  developing,  a  number  of  vehicles  to  provide  crew  and  cargo  access  to
the  International  Space  Station,  including  the  Russian  Soyuz  (crew)  and  Progress
(cargo),  the  European  Space  Agency’s  Automated  Transfer  Vehicle  (cargo),  and  the
Japanese  H–2  Transfer  Vehicle  (cargo).  The  Crew  Exploration  vehicle  will  also  be
capable of servicing the International Space Station.
Q7. How many flights of the Space Shuttle were budgeted for in the five-year budg-
etary  plan  (FY  2006–2010)  for  the  Space  Shuttle  that  was  submitted  as  part  of
the FY 2006 NASA budget request? How was the Space Shuttle five-year budget
estimate arrived at?

A7. There  was  a  great  deal  of  uncertainty  associated  with  the  outyears  of  the  FY
2006  budget  request  for  Shuttle.  NASA  was  still  working  toward  Return-to-Flight,
and had not yet addressed all issues raised by the Columbia Accident Investigation
Board (CAIB). In addition, NASA had not yet determined how many times the Shut-
tle  was  going  to  fly  before  its  retirement  in  2010.  The  President’s  FY  2006  Budget
request  stated,  ‘‘NASA  is  examining  configurations  for  the  Space  Station  that  meet
the  needs  of  both  the  new  space  exploration  vision  and  our  international  partners
using as few Shuttle flights as possible.’’ The five-year budget estimate was an esti-
mate, based on the Shuttle budget in the FY 2005 budget request.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. You  have  said  that  you  plan  to  revisit  the  possibility  of  a  Shuttle  mission  to
service Hubble because after the Shuttle completes two successful Shuttle return-
to-flight  missions,  the  Shuttle  will  then  be  ‘‘essentially  a  new  vehicle.’’  If  that  is
so, it sounds as though no extensive ‘‘recertification’’ of the Shuttle [as called for
by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board] would be required if the decision
was  made  to  fly  the  Shuttle  for  a  year  or  so  past  the  proposed  2010  retirement
date.  Is  that  an  accurate  assessment?  If  not,  what  would  still  need  to  be  recer-
tified?

A1. All  the  Criticality  1  systems  and  subsystems  on  the  Space  Shuttle  have  been
assessed  against  the  2010  retirement  date  and  found  to  be  within  their  hardware
certification  limits.  Certification  assessments  for  certain  lower  criticality  hardware
will continue through 2006. Consistent with the policy direction given in the Vision
for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle program has not assessed any certification
activity that may be required to continue flying past 2010.
Q2. NASA  plans  to  place  some  of  its  Earth  observing  sensors  on  spacecraft  built  by
other  agencies  instead  of  building  its  own  satellites.  For  example,  NASA  plans
to  put  Landsat-type  sensors  on  the  first  NOAA–DOD  NPOESS  satellite  instead
of launching a dedicated Landsat spacecraft.

Q2a. What is the status of the NPOESS program? How easy is it going to be to add

Landsat sensors to the first NPOESS?

A2a. NASA  is  a  partner  in  the  NPOESS  program.  The  NPOESS  development  is
governed  by  the  NPOESS  Executive  Committee  (ExCom)  which  has  members  from
the  Department  of  Commerce,  the  Department  of  Defense  and  NASA.  Official
NPOESS Program status should be obtained from the host agency for NPOESS; the
Department of Commerce.

The complexities of manifesting a Landsat-like sensor on the NPOESS have been
analyzed in coordination with NASA, the NPOESS IPO and the NPOESS prime con-
tractor,  Northrop  Grumman  Space  Technology.  Analysis  indicates  that  accommo-
dating  a  Landsat-like  sensor  on  the  NPOESS  spacecraft  would  entail  significant
technical challenges.

Q2b. To  what  extent  are  you  concerned  that  the  government  may  be  following  a
strategy of ‘‘putting all your eggs in one basket’’ with respect to Earth observa-
tions research and operations?

A2b. We  have  a  diversified  approach  to  Earth  observations,  research,  and  applica-
tions. We have other partnerships for measurements not destined for NPOESS. We
are  pursuing  a  four-partner  approach  for  ocean  altimetry  among  NASA,  CNES,
NOAA, and EUMETSAT with the intent that the research agencies (NASA, CNES)
will build the ocean surface topography mission, NOAA and EUMETSAT (the oper-
ational  agencies)  will  operate  it,  and  then  NOAA  and  EUMETSAT  will  continue
ocean altimetry measurements via inclusion in their future operational satellite sys-
tems.

Reducing  risk  to  long-term  data  continuity  is  the  principal  reason  for  seeking  to
acquire  selected  Earth  observations  through  NPOESS.  The  NPOESS  Preparatory
Project  (NPP),  built  by  the  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC)  with  instruments
provided by GSFC and the IPO, will serve as both a risk reduction for the NPOESS
project and also provide climate data. NPOESS is the next generation series of polar
weather  satellites,  whose  continuous  operation  is  secured  via  multiple  copies  and
flight-ready or on-orbit spares. NASA research satellites, on the other hand, because
they  are  research  missions,  tend  to  be  one-of-a-kind,  with  limited  or  no  on-orbit  re-
dundancy  or  stand-by  copies  on  the  ground.  The  idea  is  to  migrate  measurements
that  have  proven  their  value  in  NASA  research  missions  to  NPOESS  operational
systems  so  their  continuity  is  assured.  The  challenge  is  in  this  transition  phase
where  the  operational  system  taking  on  the  key  measurements  is  itself  a  new  sys-
tem. NPOESS is a ‘block change’ upgrade of the NOAA-operated, NASA-built POES
series  that  have  comprised  the  civilian  polar-orbiting  weather  satellite  system  for
many years. NASA is staying in the Earth observation business, continuing its role
of creating new Earth observation technologies and research.
Q2c. What  if  NPOESS  runs  into  cost  or  technical  problems—has  NOAA  committed

to you that it will keep the Landsat sensors on NPOESS no matter what?

A2c. The  NPOESS  management  structure  is  governed  by  the  NPOESS  Executive
Committee  (ExCom)  which  has  members  from  the  Department  of  Commerce,  the
Department  of  Defense  and  NASA.  The  manifest  of  a  Landsat-like  sensor  on  the
NPOESS platform and the resulting NPOESS implementation strategies and contin-
gencies will be governed by the NPOESS Executive Committee.
Q3. The  American  Geophysical  Union  (AGU)  released  a  statement  in  May  that  con-
cluded  that  NASA’s  Earth  and  space  science  programs  are  ‘‘at  risk.’’  The  state-
ment  said,  ‘‘There  are  indications  that  Earth  and  space  sciences  have  become
a  lower  priority  at  NASA’’  and  that  NASA’s  FY  2006  budget  plan  reduces
science  research  by  $1.2  billion  over  the  next  five  years  relative  to  the  previous
plan.  Is  the  AGU  correct  in  its  assessment?  What  is  your  response  to  the  state-
ment?

A3. While  the  FY  2006  President’s  budget  shows  a  smaller  rate  of  increase  in  the
budget for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, these programs are still growing sig-
nificantly.  The  overall  NASA  science  programs  budget  runout  shows  a  24  percent
increase from FY 2006 through FY 2010, at which science will grow from 33 percent
to approximately 38 percent of the NASA budget, enabling the Science Missions Di-
rectorate  to  continue  to  support  55  operational  missions,  26  missions  in  develop-
ment, and 34 in formulation.
Q4. On  page  2  of  your  testimony,  you  state  that  NASA  ‘‘has  adopted  a  ‘go-as-you-
can-pay’  approach  toward  space  exploration.’’  The  1990  Augustine  Commission
used the same phrase to describe its approach to human exploration beyond low
Earth orbit, but it meant something very different from what NASA’s current ap-
proach seems to be. The Augustine Commission defined science as NASA’s high-
est priority and stated that human exploration beyond low Earth orbit [or ‘‘Mis-
sion from Planet Earth’’ as they termed it] should only be funded after the other
core  missions  of  the  Agency  such  as  space  and  Earth  science  were  adequately
funded,  and  that  the  pace  of  the  human  exploration  initiative  should  be  deter-
mined  by  how  much  extra  funding  was  made  available.  Do  you  agree  with  the
Augustine Commission’s definition of ‘‘go-as-you-can-pay’’? If not, how would you
define it and why shouldn’t NASA follow the approach recommended by the Au-
gustine Commission?

A4. While  NASA  strives  to  stay  within  budget  and  ensure  adequate  support  for
Earth  and  space  science,  as  called  for  by  the  Augustine  Commission,  NASA’s  mis-
sion  has  changed  since  1990.  On  January  14,  2004,  President  George  W.  Bush  an-

nounced the Vision for Space Exploration. This bold initiative places a renewed em-
phasis  on  human  exploration  of  the  solar  system  while  continuing  to  ensure  a  bal-
anced portfolio of scientific research. Implementation of the Vision for Space Explo-
ration  will  be  enabled  by  scientific  discovery  and  will  enable  new  compelling  sci-
entific  opportunities.  In  addition,  the  Vision  offers  an  opportunity  to  stimulate
mathematics, science and engineering in America’s grade, undergraduate and grad-
uate studies programs.
Q5. NASA  officials  indicated  to  us  earlier  this  year  that  substantial  job  cuts  were
assumed  in  the  budget  projections  contained  in  your  FY  2006  budget.  Specifi-
cally,  we  were  told  that  the  number  of  budgeted  civil  service  full  time  equiva-
lents (FTEs) will drop by almost 2,500 over the next year and a half.
• Do you still anticipate that level of personnel cuts?
• If so, what are the details of those cuts by Center and by discipline?
• If not, what is your current best estimate, and why has it changed?

A5. The NASA workforce has been impacted by significant budget reductions in our
aeronautics  programs,  cancellation  of  programs,  and  investment  changes  to  the  re-
search and technology portfolio of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate. We
have  taken  specific  actions  to  try  to  alleviate  this  problem.  For  example,  starting
in  November  2004,  NASA  implemented  employee  buyouts  to  rebalance  the  work-
force  and  in  January  2005  established  hiring  guidelines  to  emphasize  filling  vacan-
cies from within the Agency. We are also making significant changes that will help
ensure  that  NASA’s  Centers  have  a  productive  future.  Contractors  will  continue  to
play a key role, but we need to ensure that the Federal Government maintains the
in-house  intellectual  core  capacity  to  sustain  NASA’s  exploration,  science  and  aero-
nautics missions. Our goal is to ensure that NASA Centers are productive contribu-
tors to the Agency’s agenda and that we have the people and tools necessary to ac-
complish  the  long-term  goals  of  space  exploration.  With  that  in  mind,  we  will  be
making changes at Headquarters as well.

In  September,  NASA  initiated  an  Institutional  Requirements  Review  (IRR)  the
scope  of  which  includes  corporate  G&A,  corporate  service  pools,  and  all  Head-
quarters-based  operations.  Our  goals  are  to  keep  corporately  funded  requirements
within  overall  corporate  budget  guidelines,  reduce  the  total  workforce  at  Head-
quarters commensurate with its appropriate role and overall size of the Agency, and
consolidate  required  personnel  at  the  Headquarters  building.  We  aim  to  (1)  gain
operational  efficiencies;  (2)  align  ourselves  to  a  management  model  that  has  Head-
quarters in charge of architecture, strategy, policy, compliance, and general manage-
ment  with  field  Centers  executing  programs  and  projects;  and  (3)  set  an  example
for the rest of the Agency of the willingness of Headquarters to make hard decisions
that benefit NASA in the long run.

Assuming we can achieve additional buyouts in the next few months and redirect
some  of  our  in-house  capacity  to  performing  core  activities  related  to  exploration,
science,  and  aeronautics  missions,  NASA  has  approximately  950  civil  servants  in
the field without program coverage in FY 2006.

We  will  continue  to  address  this  problem  and  structure  the  workforce  to  ensure
the  success  of  the  exploration  vision,  as  well  as  NASA’s  other  missions  in  science,
aeronautics,  education,  space  operations  and  exploration.  However,  changes  to  our
skill mix and, therefore, the workforce will be required.

The  NASA  Office  of  Human  Capital  continues  to  work  with  center  management
on  the  workforce  strategies.  We  will  continue  to  identify  center  work  assignments

based on our strategic planning for the exploration systems. We are in the planning
stages of offering a final buyout program to employees.

If we are unable to cover all of the NASA civil service positions, NASA is planning
to conduct a Reduction in Force (RIF). Our Office of Human Capital is working with
human  resource  offices  at  the  centers  to  ensure  readiness  for  a  RIF,  should  it  be-
come necessary. However, a RIF is a last resort, and we will exhaust all other rea-
sonable possibilities before undertaking such an action.

With  changes  to  NASA’s  mission,  it  is  important  that  we  manage  our  workforce
issues  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  right  skill  mix  to  successfully  execute  the  vision
for  space  exploration  and  maintain  the  important  work  in  other  areas  such  as  our
aeronautics,  space  operations  and  science  portfolios.  We  will  have  an  integrated,
Agency-wide approach to human capital management.

Questions submitted by Representative Brian Baird
Q1. Last year, the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) issued contracts
to  firms  from  the  Explorations  Systems  Research  and  Technology  and  Human
Systems Research and Technology programs. In April, NASA announced it was
‘‘indefinitely  deferring’’  the  expected  Broad  Agency  Announcement  for  these  two
programs. The Agency promised ‘‘additional insight into our revised plans.’’

A1. The  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  did  issue  contracts  last  year  for
Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  but  none  for  Human  Systems  Re-
search  and  Technology.  The  Broad  Agency  Announcement  planned  for  2005  was
canceled  in  anticipation  of  the  change  in  direction  being  outlined  by  new  Adminis-
trator Michael Griffin.
Q1a. In issuing these contracts, NASA was hoping to attract interest from non-tradi-
tional sources. In many cases, these are smaller firms that have a harder time
with  uncertainty  in  funding  and  planning  than  the  usual  government  sources.
Does NASA intend to honor the contracts that it has already signed?

A1a. The  Exploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  projects  have  been  re-
aligned  to  support  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study’s  (ESAS)  rec-
ommended requirements including accelerated development of the new Crew Explo-
ration  Vehicle  (CEV),  the  Crew  Launch  vehicle  (CLV)  and  the  lunar  lander.  This
realignment  has  resulted  in  a  focused  and  phased,  requirements  driven  Research
and Technology program in which some projects are curtailed, some modified or de-
layed,  and  some  added.  On  going  projects  are  streamlined  to  deliver  technology  ca-
pabilities when needed to meet the accelerated development schedules for the CEV,
launch systems and lunar lander. In FY 2005, 80 tasks and activities are being dis-
continued since they do not directly support ESAS architecture or schedule require-
ments.  NASA,  however,  is  continuing  to  investigate  innovative  procurements  for
commercial resupply of crew and cargo to the ISS and encouraging other innovative
approaches (Centennial Challenges) to assist our exploration objectives.
Q1b. What steps is the Agency taking for the disposition of these contracts?
A1b. The  first  step  was  to  notify  Congress  via  the  FY  2005  Operating  Plan  Sep-
tember  update,  which  included  the  modifications.  The  next  step  is  to  provide  af-
fected  contractors  with  termination  notices  following  consideration  by  the  Commit-
tees of the Operating Plan. NASA will also provide the contractors with two months
of  FY  2006  funding  for  closeout  costs.  Additional  closeout  costs  will  be  negotiated
on a case-by-case basis.
Q1c. What is your timetable for the disposition of those contracts?
A1c. Notification of effected contractors is projected by late-October.
Q1d. When are we likely to know NASA’s intentions to resume procurements in these

programs?

A1d. ESMD  does  not  anticipate  any  new  Broad  Agency  Announcements  in  these
programs.  Our  future  research  will  be  directed,  with  the  intention  of  focusing  our
efforts  and  funding  on  near  term  technologies  designed  to  accelerate  the  develop-
ment  of  the  crew  exploration  vehicle  and  lunar  sortie  missions.  Much  of  this  di-
rected research will be at NASA Centers. Industry and universities will provide ca-
pabilities and expertise that is not resident at the NASA Centers.

Questions submitted by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee
Q1. Dr. Griffin, as a long-time supporter of NASA, my greatest priority at this point
is  safety.  The  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  led  by  Admiral  Gehman
was able to determine the cause of the accident and was a solid first step in es-
tablishing  new  safety  procedures  for  future  space  exploration  missions.  Since
last year, I have called for such a commission to be formed to investigate safety
aboard  the  International  Space  Station.  Will  you  support  the  formation  of  such
a commission?

This 

document,

available 

A1. I  share  your  passion  for  conducting  NASA’s  space  and  aeronautics  missions
safely  and  let  me  assure  you  that  we  do  not  take  for  granted  the  health  or  safety
of our astronauts and pilots who are needed to help us explore humankind’s remain-
ing  frontiers.  After  the  investigation  of  the  Columbia  accident,  our  stakeholders
challenged  us  to  address  each  recommendation  provided  by  the  Columbia  Accident
Report. You may be familiar with the extensive planning undertaken by the Shuttle
program  to  address  its  cited  deficiencies  since  the  overwhelming  share  of  public
scrutiny was focused on the Shuttle’s return-to-flight. Much less apparent, but none-
theless  just  as  important,  were  the  lessons  that  NASA  wove  into  the  fiber  of  many
other  programs  across  all  our  centers.  The  International  Space  Station  drafted  its
own  implementation  plan  for  supporting  the  continuation  of  flight  of  the  ISS  enti-
tled,  NASA’s  Implementation  Plan  for  International  Space  Station  Continuing
Flight. 
http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/
110883main¥Station¥CFT¥Rev2.pdf, demonstrates NASA’s commitment to the ap-
plication  of  lessons  learned  from  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  rec-
ommendations  and  observations  in  support  of  safe  continuing  flight  of  the  Inter-
national Space Station.

The  Aerospace  Safety  Advisory  Panel  (ASAP)  is  my  source  of  expert  consultation
on safety matters as well as a representative of our external stakeholders. In order
to assure that ASAP is satisfied with the approaches we are taking to ensure safety;
we  have  methodically  provided  its  members  with  copies  of  the  plan  at  each  step  of
its  iteration.  NASA  briefed  the  ASAP  about  the  plan  during  its  development.  Con-
sistent  with  your  request  for  a  review  of  safety  aboard  the  ISS,  I  have  asked  Vice
Admiral Joe Dyer, Chairman of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP), to re-
view  the  ISS  plan  again  independently,  and  to  verify  that  this  important  program
has  properly  implemented  the  CAIB  findings  into  its  own  planning.  As  you  know,
the  ASAP  is  an  independent  group  of  industry  and  non-NASA  government  leaders
and safety experts that advises me Administrator on safety matters with an empha-
sis on human space flight. Congress originally chartered this panel after the Apollo
fire, and the panel has been effective over the years in helping NASA focus on safe-
ty  related  design,  operational  and  cultural  issues.  I  have  asked  Admiral  Dyer  to
complete  his  review  by  the  end  of  the  calendar  year,  and  I  look  forward  to  sharing
the results of his study with you and your staff.
Q2. I am especially concerned to learn that the Stafford-Covey Return-to-Flight Task
Group,  the  independent  oversight  panel  chartered  by  NASA  to  certify  that  the
15  safety  recommendations  of  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  are
met,  has  stated  that  three  of  these  recommendations  remain  incomplete  in  ad-
vance of a proposed July launch. Will you delay the launch to make certain that
the problems faced by Columbia have been completely resolved?

A2. NASA’s  Return-to-Flight  process  has  been  guided  by  the  fifteen  Return-to-
Flight  recommendations  of  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  and  the
Space  Shuttle  program’s  own  internally  generated  ‘‘raise  the  bar’’  actions.  NASA’s
implementation  of  the  Board’s  Return-to-Flight  recommendations  has  been  inde-
pendently  assessed  by  the  Return-to-Flight  Task  Group.  NASA’s  overall  Return-to-
Flight  progress  has  been  documented  in  the  periodically  updated  Implementation
Plan for Space Shuttle Return-to-Flight and Beyond.

On  August  17,  2005,  the  Return-to-Flight  Task  Group  released  its  Final  Report.
In  it,  the  Task  Group  unanimously  closed  out  all  but  three  of  the  Board’s  Return-
to-Flight  recommendations.  The  Task  Group  could  not  reach  consensus  on  whether
NASA’s  actions  fully  met  the  intent  of  three  of  the  Board’s  most  challenging  rec-
ommendations: External Tank Thermal Protection System Modifications (3.2–1), Or-
biter  Hardening  and  Impact  Tolerance  (3.3–2)  and  Thermal  Protection  System  On-
Orbit  Inspection  and  Repair  (6.4–1).  The  Task  group  noted  NASA  had  made  sub-
stantial  progress  relative  to  these  recommendations,  and  emphasized  that,  ‘‘The
ability to fully comply with all of the [Board’s] recommendations does not imply that
the Space Shuttle is unsafe.’’ The first two Return-to-Flight missions, STS–114 and
STS–121, will provide the data and flight experience needed to address the remain-

ing  open  issues  in  these  recommendations.  This  work  will  be  documented  in  future
updates to the Implementation Plan.

NASA made the decision to proceed with the launch of STS–114 on July 26, 2005
based  on  Return-to-Flight  Task  Group’s  assessment,  the  totality  of  improvements
made  to  the  Space  Shuttle  system  during  Return-to-Flight,  and  the  vetting  of  all
these  improvements  through  a  rigorous  and  multi-layered  engineering  review  proc-
ess.

Post-flight  analysis  of  STS–114  indicated  that,  except  for  one  event,  the  thermal
protection  system  on  the  External  Tank  performed  within  expected  parameters.
Most  of  the  small  foam  shedding  events  that  were  observed  with  the  upgraded  im-
agery  and  sensor  capabilities  developed  during  Return-to-Flight  posed  little  or  no
threat  to  the  Orbiter.  The  one  event  of  concern  was  the  loss  of  an  approximately
one-pound piece of foam from the area of the External Tank’s liquid hydrogen protu-
berance air load (PAL) ramp. NASA commissioned two teams (one lead by the Space
Shuttle  propulsion  manager,  the  other  an  independent  ‘‘Tiger  Team’’  reporting  di-
rectly  to  the  Associate  Administrator  for  Space  Operations)  to  analyze  these  foam
loss  events  and  recommend  any  forward  work  that  would  have  to  be  done  prior  to
the launch of the next mission, STS–121.

As of September 2005, NASA is reviewing flight opportunities for future missions
given  the  effects  of  Hurricane  Katrina  (which  caused  extensive  damage  to  the  area
around  the  External  Tank  manufacturing  facility  near  New  Orleans)  on  ongoing
foam  loss  troubleshooting  and  normal  processing  activities.  NASA  is  targeting  the
May 2006 launch window as the next opportunity to launch STS–121.
Q3. It  has  come  to  my  attention  that  the  NASA  Education  Office  has  been  merged
into the Strategic Communication Office. How will this affect NASA’s education
program?  Furthermore,  how  will  this  affect  NASA’s  assistance  and  work  with
minority serving institutions?

A3. As directed by the NASA Administrator, the Office of Education is now part of
the  Strategic  Communications  component  at  NASA  Headquarters.  Under  the  direc-
tion of the Chief of Strategic Communications, the Office of External Relations, the
Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of Public Affairs, and the Office of Education
are now working more closely than ever regarding our regular and ongoing commu-
nications with our stakeholder communities. This ensures that more timely and con-
sistent  information  is  provided  to  the  distinct  stakeholder  communities  serviced  by
each office. Specifically, the Office of Education, its functions, and all programs pre-
viously  in  place  remain  intact.  Program  operations  under  the  Chief  of  Strategic
Communications will have no adverse affect on NASA’s assistance to and work with
the  minority  serving  institutions  (MSIs).  NASA’s  education  programs  will  continue
to provide opportunities for MSI faculty and students to participate in the Agency’s
research and education programs.
Q4. NASA  officials  indicated  to  us  earlier  this  year  that  substantial  job  cuts  were
assumed  in  the  budget  projections  contained  in  your  FY  2006  budget.  Specifi-
cally,  we  were  told  that  the  number  of  budgeted  civil  service  full  time  equiva-
lents (FTEs) will drop by almost 2,500 over the next year and a half.
• Do you still anticipate that level of personnel cuts?
• If so, what are the details of those cuts by Center and by discipline?
• If not, what is your current best estimate, and why has it changed?

A4. The NASA workforce has been impacted by significant budget reductions in our
aeronautics  programs,  cancellation  of  programs,  and  investment  changes  to  the  re-
search and technology portfolio of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate. We
have  taken  specific  actions  to  try  to  alleviate  this  problem.  For  example,  starting
in  November  2004,  NASA  implemented  employee  buyouts  to  rebalance  the  work-
force  and  in  January  2005  established  hiring  guidelines  to  emphasize  filling  vacan-
cies from within the Agency. We are also making significant changes that will help
ensure  that  NASA’s  Centers  have  a  productive  future.  Contractors  will  continue  to
play a key role, but we need to ensure that the Federal Government maintains the
in-house  intellectual  core  capacity  to  sustain  NASA’s  exploration,  science  and  aero-
nautics missions. Our goal is to ensure that NASA Centers are productive contribu-
tors to the Agency’s agenda and that we have the people and tools necessary to ac-
complish  the  long-term  goals  of  space  exploration.  With  that  in  mind,  we  will  be
making changes at Headquarters as well.

In  September,  NASA  initiated  an  Institutional  Requirements  Review  (IRR)  the
scope  of  which  includes  corporate  G&A,  corporate  service  pools,  and  all  Head-
quarters-based  operations.  Our  goals  are  to  keep  corporately  funded  requirements
within  overall  corporate  budget  guidelines,  reduce  the  total  workforce  at  Head-

quarters commensurate with its appropriate role and overall size of the Agency, and
consolidate  required  personnel  at  the  Headquarters  building.  We  aim  to  (1)  gain
operational  efficiencies;  (2)  align  ourselves  to  a  management  model  that  has  Head-
quarters in charge of architecture, strategy, policy, compliance, and general manage-
ment  with  field  Centers  executing  programs  and  projects;  and  (3)  set  an  example
for the rest of the Agency of the willingness of Headquarters to make hard decisions
that benefit NASA in the long run.

Assuming we can achieve additional buyouts in the next few months and redirect
some  of  our  in-house  capacity  to  performing  core  activities  related  to  exploration,
science,  and  aeronautics  missions,  NASA  has  approximately  950  civil  servants  in
the field without program coverage in FY 2006.

We  will  continue  to  address  this  problem  and  structure  the  workforce  to  ensure
the  success  of  the  exploration  vision,  as  well  as  NASA’s  other  missions  in  science,
aeronautics,  education,  space  operations  and  exploration.  However,  changes  to  our
skill mix and, therefore, the workforce will be required.

The  NASA  Office  of  Human  Capital  continues  to  work  with  center  management
on  the  workforce  strategies.  We  will  continue  to  identify  center  work  assignments
based on our strategic planning for the exploration systems. We are in the planning
stages of offering a final buyout program to employees.

If we are unable to cover all of the NASA civil service positions, NASA is planning
to conduct a Reduction in Force (RIF). Our Office of Human Capital is working with
human  resource  offices  at  the  centers  to  ensure  readiness  for  a  RIF,  should  it  be-
come necessary. However, a RIF is a last resort, and we will exhaust all other rea-
sonable possibilities before undertaking such an action.

With  changes  to  NASA’s  mission,  it  is  important  that  we  manage  our  workforce
issues  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  right  skill  mix  to  successfully  execute  the  vision
for  space  exploration  and  maintain  the  important  work  in  other  areas  such  as  our
aeronautics,  space  operations  and  science  portfolios.  We  will  have  an  integrated,
Agency-wide approach to human capital management.
Q5. When do you expect the first humans to set foot on Mars? What is that estimate
based  on,  and  can  that  be  done  within  a  NASA  budget  that  is  flat  or  at  best
keeping pace with inflation? If so, how?

A5. When  the  President  unveiled  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  on  January  14,
2004,  he  announced  a  plan  to  extend  human  presence  across  the  solar  system  and
beyond.  NASA’s  exploration  architecture  lays  out  our  plans  for  developing  launch,
transportation,  landing  and  habitation  systems  that  will  enable  a  return  to  the
Moon by 2018, followed by sustained human presence on the Moon while preparing
for later Mars missions. This architecture will be affordable and will institute a ‘‘go
as you can afford to pay’’ budget approach. We’re not far enough along in the plan-
ning  to  say  exactly  when  the  first  human  flight  to  Mars  will  be,  however  we  will
already  have  much  of  the  architecture,  including  the  heavy  lift  vehicle,  a  versatile
crew  capsule  and  propulsion  systems,  needed  to  get  there.  In  addition,  experience
from  missions  to  the  Moon  will  lay  the  groundwork  for  using  Martian  resources.  A
lunar  outpost,  just  three  days  away  from  Earth,  will  provide  us  with  the  needed
practice of ‘‘living off the land’’ that will be required for the longer missions to Mars.

that  NASA  will  need  to  do  more  in  the  future,  but  NASA  was  not  endeavoring
to  have  long-term  human  flight  at  this  time.  Shortly  after  answering  my  ques-
tion, you referenced the Administration’s goal of visiting Mars. If I am not mis-
taken,  flight  to  Mars  will  take  years  just  to  traverse  the  distance.  While  I  can
understand why many resources will be committed to developing a vehicle capa-
ble  of  distance  flight,  I  would  hope  engineering  plans  would  also  seek  to  allevi-
ate  or  mitigate  physical  stress  on  the  human  flight  crew.  When  placed  in  zero
gravity  for  extended  periods,  tremendous  physical  changes  take  place  in  the
human body such as accelerated skeletal aging, muscle atrophy and inexplicable
biochemical  signaling  disturbances  that  lead  to  anemia  and  immune  dysfunc-
tion  in  crew.  Vigorous  life  science  research  will  be  necessary  to  assist  engineers
in  solving  such  problems  involved  in  long-term  human  flight.  Would  you  agree
that maintaining a life science program at NASA is essential to obtaining stated
goals of NASA and the President?

A1. Four  types  of  missions  are  currently  planned  for  NASA:  1)  Long  duration,  up
to six months in Low Earth Orbit; 2) short duration, 9–14 day missions to the Moon
starting  in  2018;  3)  longer  duration  stays  (up  to  six  months)  on  the  Lunar  surface,
and  4)  a  long  duration  mission  to  Mars  later  in  the  century.  Physiological  changes
develop in astronauts in microgravity and become more profound on extended dura-
tion missions.

Current  research  is  directed  toward  the  validation  of  countermeasures  protecting
human  health  on  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).  Medical  standards  for  ad-
dressing the affects of space flight are being developed, as are prototypes of medical
care.  Also  critical,  environmental  health  and  radiation  protection  research  is  being
conducted  on  ISS  and  in  the  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  facility.  Significant
resources  are  directed  toward  developing  life  support  technology  and  autonomous
medical care without which longer missions such as Mars will not be possible.

NASA  Life  Sciences  has  provided  significant  contributions  to  our  understanding
of  the  physiological  changes  and  human  adaptation  to  microgravity.  ISS  continues
to provide invaluable data on the exposure of humans to microgravity and the time
course  of  these  changes,  information  which  is  also  needed  for  Mars.  The  National
Space  Biomedical  Research  Institute  has  been  created  to  address  space  physiology,
psychosocial  issues,  and  medicine,  and  to  link  with  the  Johnson  Space  Center  and
other members of the Space Life Sciences community to address these issues. Obvi-
ously,  NASA  will  also  continue  to  rely  on  the  contributions  of  the  National  Insti-
tutes of Health research in relevant areas.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN

Review of President’s FY 2006 Budget

Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon  and  Members  of  the
Committee  for  inviting  me  to  appear  before  you  for  today’s  hearing.  You  have  in-
vited me to appear before your committee as a private citizen on several past occa-
sions  to  discuss  our  nation’s  space  program.  Today,  I’m  testifying  before  you  in  a
much  different  capacity—as  NASA  Administrator.  When  I  previously  appeared  be-
fore you, I would use phrases such ‘‘they (meaning NASA) should do X or Y.’’ I now
need  another  choice  of  pronouns.  We  at  NASA  have  a  lot  of  work  to  do.  We  have
many challenges to overcome. We need to work closely with this committee and the
entire  Congress  in  carrying  out  the  many  challenges  before  us,  and  we  will  need
your help in this great endeavor.

In your invitation, you asked me to address my guiding philosophy and plans for
setting  priorities  for  NASA’s  programs  in  human  space  flight,  space  science,  Earth
science,  and  aeronautics,  as  well  as  its  workforce  and  infrastructure.  That’s  a  tall
order for a five minute summary, so this might take a little longer.

The  Science  Committee  has  already  received  testimony  this  year  from  NASA’s
Deputy  Administrator,  Fred  Gregory,  concerning  NASA’s  FY  2006  budget  request,
you’ve  held  focused  hearings  on  NASA’s  aeronautics  R&D  and  Earth  science  pro-
grams, and few weeks ago your committee held the first-ever Congressional hearing
with  a  live  feed  from  astronaut  John  Phillips  onboard  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion. I will try to focus my testimony today on my guiding philosophy and priorities,
and  will  update  the  Committee  on  where  we  are  and  where  we  are  going.  It  has
been  a  busy  time  for  me  personally  as  well  as  for  the  entire  NASA  team.  We  have
a lot of work ahead of us.

In  presenting  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  last  year,  the  President  defined  a
focus for our nation’s space program in a journey of exploration that will be carried
out over the next several decades. In heading down this path, the first steps we take
are critically important, and decisions need to be made in a timely manner.

The  first  step  is  to  return  the  Space  Shuttle  to  flight,  and  to  fly  each  mission
thereafter  as  safely  as  possible.  This  is  my  top  priority  as  NASA  Administrator.
Last  week  I  participated  in  an  engineering  review  of  the  risk  to  the  Shuttle  due  to
foam and ice debris, which we believe to have been greatly mitigated since the loss
of Columbia. I met with the Stafford-Covey Return-To-Flight Task Group this morn-
ing to hear the concerns of the panel members. Given the level of complexity of the
issues  involved,  we  need  their  point  of  view.  We  need  these  complex  issues  to  be
discussed openly and accurately.

Tonight, I leave for Kennedy Space Center for the Flight Readiness Review of the
STS–114  mission  with  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery  commanded  by  USAF  Colonel
Eileen  Collins.  At  this  review,  the  NASA  team  will  determine  if  we’re  ready  to  fly
when  the  next  launch  window  opens  in  mid-July.  I  look  forward  to  a  healthy,  open
dialogue  about  Space  Shuttle  safety  issues  and  NASA’s  ability  to  return  the  Space
Shuttle  to  flight.  Members  of  the  Science  Committee  are  invited  to  Kennedy  Space
Center  for  this  launch,  but  let  me  caution  everyone  involved  that  the  entire  NASA
Space  Shuttle  team  has  a  lot  of  hard  work  to  do,  and  many  things  can  happen  be-
tween now and the date of launch.

Following a safe return-to-flight, we will turn our sights to the construction of the
International  Space  Station  and,  after  its  completion,  the  retirement  of  the  Space
Shuttle  by  2010.  To  this  end,  a  team  of  experts  within  NASA  are  investigating  a
range  of  realistic  ISS  configuration  and  Shuttle  manifest  options  before  we  retire
the  Shuttle  in  2010.  I  met  again  with  the  team  earlier  this  morning,  and  I  hope
to  present  NASA’s  proposed  plan  for  the  ISS  configuration  and  Shuttle  manifest  to
you  and  our  international  partners  later  this  summer.  Let  me  emphasize  to  every-
one  that  this  is  a  proposal  that  requires  further  discussion.  I  visited  with  many  of
our partners a few weeks ago during the Paris Air Show. We shared with each other
our  thoughts  on  the  International  Space  Station  and  other  areas  of  cooperation  in
space  exploration.  I  look  forward  to  continuing  an  open  dialogue  with  our  inter-
national partners on how best to use the Space Station as a testbed for future space
exploration activities, and how to realize tangible benefits from the fruits of this re-
search.

Even  as  a  testbed,  the  Space  Station  will  not  answer  all  of  the  questions  that
need  to  be  answered  before  we  begin  to  explore  the  Moon  and  Mars.  However,  if
a  problem  occurs  on  the  Space  Station,  the  crew  is  only  a  few  hours  away  from  a
safe  return  to  Earth,  while  they  will  be  three  days  away  when  on  the  Moon,  and
many months away from home during the long journey to Mars.

The  loss  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  has  made  us  acutely  aware  that  one  of
the  major  impediments  in  fully  utilizing  the  Space  Station’s  capabilities  is  that  we
need  a  more  robust  logistics  capability  for  crew  and  cargo  than  the  United  States
or  our  international  partners  have  readily  available  or  on  the  drawing  board.  For
this  reason,  we  plan  to  leverage  our  nation’s  commercial  space  industry  to  meet
NASA’s  needs  for  ISS  cargo  logistics  and  possibly  crew  support.  I  spoke  in  some
depth on this topic at last week’s Space Transportation Association breakfast about
my  guiding  philosophy  in  dealing  constructively  with  the  emerging  commercial
space  industry.  I  want  to  thank  Congressmen  Hall  and  Calvert  for  taking  part  in
that event.

To  meet  the  need  for  crew  rescue  support  for  the  Space  Station,  NASA  will  re-
quire  the  help  of  this  committee  in  helping  to  resolve  certain  restrictions  placed  on
cooperation  with  Russia  in  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000.  This  Administra-
tion recognizes the value of effective cooperation with our international partners on
the  Space  Station.  At  the  same  time,  we  must  appropriately  respect  and  maintain
our  nation’s  nonproliferation  objectives.  Over  the  last  several  months,  NASA  has
participated in an interagency coordination process and is proposing a legislative so-
lution  in  the  form  of  an  amendment  to  the  Iran  Nonproliferation  Act  of  2000  that
would  provide  NASA  with  the  necessary  flexibility  while  maintaining  our  nation’s
nonproliferation objectives.

If a solution is not found, we believe that U.S. astronauts will need to cease main-
taining  permanent  presence  aboard  the  Space  Station  in  April  2006,  in  accordance
with  previous  agreements  between  NASA  and  Russia  concerning  crew  rescue  sup-
port  for  the  ISS  using  the  Russian  Soyuz  vehicle.  We  do  not  believe  this  situation
was  the  intent  of  Congress  back  in  2000,  but  this  is  the  consequence  we  are  facing
today. I also should note that NASA did not plan to rely so extensively on the Rus-
sian Space Agency in carrying out the Space Station program, but this is the situa-
tion  in  which  we  find  ourselves  today.  The  Administration  expects  to  deliver  this
proposed  legislative  solution  to  the  Congress  in  the  very  near  future.  We  will  need
this committee’s help in dealing with these restrictions.

In  the  future,  I  believe  that  we  need  to  ensure  that  the  United  States  does  not
find  our  space  program  so  heavily  reliant  on  others.  Toward  this  end,  NASA  must
accelerate  the  development  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  which  will  be  capable
of ferrying our astronauts to and from the Space Station, and of conducting voyages
to the Moon and Mars. We have a team of some of the best engineers and managers
drawn from across the Agency looking at ways to accelerate the development of the
Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  and  we  hope  to  soon  share  with  the  Congress  our  plans
for the overall space exploration architecture, the CEV, and the transportation sys-
tem needed to launch it.

Another  major  initiative  underway  concerns  how  we  as  an  Agency  consisting  of
ten field centers plan to organize our workforce and facilities to carry out our explo-
ration,  aeronautics,  and  science  missions.  Having  visited  all  of  the  NASA  centers
within the past few weeks, I firmly believe that more authority should be delegated
to  program  managers  at  these  centers,  while  NASA  headquarters  should  focus  on
policy, budget, and program executive functions. Frankly, NASA headquarters staff-
ing has grown too large over the last several years.

Another  of  the  things  I  realized  during  my  tour  of  NASA’s  field  centers  is  that
some  outdated  facilities  need  to  be  modernized,  closed,  or  mothballed.  We  will  con-
duct  a  study,  across  the  Agency,  to  determine  which  facilities  belong  in  which  cat-
egory.  This  analysis  of  our  assets  will  require  close  coordination  with  our  DOD,
FAA, and industry stakeholders.

NASA  is  facing  difficult  choices  in  balancing  the  needs  of  the  Agency’s  civil  serv-
ant workforce with the missions the Agency conducts on behalf of the Nation along
with the budget available. We have not yet decided whether any involuntary layoffs
of  NASA’s  civil  servants  will  be  needed  in  the  future,  beyond  those  already  an-
nounced at Langley Research Center due to an A–76 competition. Thus, we are con-
ducting  an  assessment  of  the  Agency  in  organizing  the  work  to  be  done  and  work-
force  needs.  I  plan  to  have  interim  answers  in  the  coming  weeks,  but  this  will  be
a  difficult  problem  for  the  next  several  years.  As  a  team,  we  are  trying  to  be  sen-
sitive  in  balancing  the  needs  of  the  workforce,  NASA’s  mission  requirements,  and
our budget constraints. I hope to keep NASA’s workforce and the Congress informed
as much as humanly possible.

However, I need to be straightforward with all concerned. NASA cannot afford ev-
erything  on  its  plate  today.  We  must  set  clear  priorities  and  remain  within  the
budget  NASA  has  been  allocated.  We  are  taking  a  ‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay’’  ap-
proach toward space exploration, but at several field centers, NASA has a gross mis-
match  between  the  work  to  be  done,  the  size  of  the  civil  service  workforce,  and  the
budget available. We are working through these issues and trying to consult every-

80

one as much as possible, but difficult decisions will be required, and these decisions
must be made in a timely manner.

Another  set  of  major,  upcoming  decisions  that  we  at  NASA  need  to  address  con-
cern  how  best  to  manage  several  space  astronomy  missions  under  development.
Congress  has  been  clear  in  its  priorities  for  the  Agency.  NASA  is  making  plans  for
a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, but we need to complete two suc-
cessful Shuttle test flights before we can assess the relative risks of another Shuttle
mission  to  the  Hubble.  This  assessment  should  be  completed  this  fall.  At  the  same
time,  we  are  conducting  an  assessment  of  significant  cost  growth  purported  for  the
James  Webb  Space  Telescope,  a  high  priority  mission  under  development  within
NASA’s astronomy portfolio. I have called for a special review of the program to re-
port  back  in  late  July.  In  the  meantime,  we  have  decided  that  NASA  will  accept
the  European  Space  Agency’s  offer  to  launch  the  Webb  Space  Telescope  spacecraft
on an Ariane V rocket as their contribution to the overall mission.

However,  the  problems  facing  both  of  these  space  telescopes  jeopardize  the  budg-
ets  for  other  advanced  astronomy  and  space  physics  missions  currently  under  for-
mulation. Again, NASA simply cannot afford everything on its plate.

Another  priority  is  the  acceleration  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle.  In  order  to
accelerate development of the CEV and its associated launch vehicle, while keeping
within NASA’s budget guidelines, NASA will need to defer the development of some
other  space  exploration-related  technologies,  ISS  research,  and  space  nuclear  sys-
tems that are only needed after the CEV comes on-line in the post-2010 timeframe.
Within the Science Mission Directorate, NASA is seeking a better balance in how
priorities  are  set  between  Earth  and  space  science  missions.  NASA  has  a  robust
science  agenda—with  55  missions  in  orbit,  26  missions  in  development—including
the  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  to  map  the  Moon’s  surface  in  great  detail—and
34 missions in the design phase. However, due to cost growth and the extended life
on several missions, NASA will need to defer some missions.

One of those missions which we hope to extend is the Tropical Rainfall Measuring
Mission  (or  TRMM),  a  research  satellite  which  has  exceeded  our  expectations  in
being  used  operationally  with  hurricane  forecasts.  NASA  is  working  closely  with
NOAA,  the  Japanese  Government,  and  others  in  the  interagency  process  to  deter-
mine  the  legal  liabilities  and  safety  measures  necessary  in  extending  this  mission.
NASA  and  NOAA  need  to  continue  to  work  closely  together,  especially  in
transitioning  NASA-developed  sensors,  research,  and  other  capabilities  to  oper-
ations.  Likewise,  NASA  also  needs  NOAA’s  operational  sensors  to  enable  further
Earth Science research.

In aeronautics research, NASA needs to focus its technical expertise and facilities
on  results-oriented  programs  for  our  nation.  The  Administration  supports  the  call
for  the  development  of  a  national  aeronautics  policy  in  H.R.  2862,  the  FY  2006  ap-
propriation bill for NASA that recently passed the House of Representatives. NASA
must work closely with a broad range of stakeholders and customers, including the
Congress,  Defense  Department,  and  FAA  in  developing  this  national  aeronautics
policy.  But  again,  I  need  to  be  straightforward  with  you.  This  policy  needs  to  set
clear,  realistic  priorities  to  focus  NASA’s  limited  resources,  and  not  simply  be  a
laundry list of unrelated projects.

To  conclude,  I  would  like  to  note  that  next  week  our  nation  will  celebrate  our
Independence  Day,  a  day  of  fireworks  and  celebration.  That  same  day,  NASA  sat-
ellite operators working on the Deep Impact mission will be hard at work trying to
create  their  own  fireworks  display,  80  million  miles  from  Earth,  by  smashing  a
small spacecraft into the comet Temple 1 at 23,000 miles per hour to discover what’s
inside. It’s a difficult mission. . .even for rocket scientists.

The  men  and  women  of  NASA  appreciate  the  risks  our  nation  is  willing  to  make
for  the  noble  purpose  of  exploration  and  science.  Meriwether  Lewis  observed  in  his
journal  two  hundred  years  ago  on  July  4th,  1805:  ‘‘We  all  believe  that  we  are  now
about  to  enter  on  the  most  perilous  and  difficult  part  of  our  voyage,  yet  I  see  no
one  repining;  all  appear  ready  to  meet  those  difficulties  which  wait  us  with  resolu-
tion and becoming fortitude.’’
