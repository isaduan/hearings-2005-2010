SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Reorienting the U.S. Global Research

Program Toward a User-Driven

Research Endeavor: H.R. 906

THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2007

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Thursday, May 3, 2007 the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the
Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on
H.R.  906,  the  Global  Climate  Change  Research  Data  and  Management  Act  of  2007.
Introduced  by  Representative  Mark  Udall  and  Representative  Robert  Inglis,  H.R.
906 would replace the current law that formally established the U.S. Global Change
Research  Program  (USGCRP)  in  1990  and  reorient  the  program  to  produce  more
user-friendly  research  and  information.  The  USGCRP  has  advanced  our  scientific
knowledge  of  the  Earth’s  atmosphere  and  climate  and  has  provided  us  with  new
data and information on the planet. However, scientific knowledge about the Earth’s
climate  has  expanded  and  improved  since  1990.  There  is  a  need  to  apply  the  im-
proved knowledge we have gained about climate to produce information that federal,
State,  and  local  officials,  resource  managers,  and  businesses  can  use  to  develop  re-
sponse, adaptation, and mitigation strategies to reduce their vulnerability to climate
change.

The  Global  Change  Research  and  Data  Management  Act  would  require  the  Ad-
ministration  to  identify  and  consult  with  members  of  the  user  community  in  devel-
oping  the  USGCRP  research  plan.  The  bill  would  also  establish  a  new  interagency
working  group  to  coordinate  federal  policies  on  data  management  and  archiving.
The  measure  would  also  retain  language  from  the  original  statute  that  establishes
the  USGCRP  and  call  for  the  administration  to  produce  a  national  assessment  of
climate change every four years.
USGCRP Background
History of the Current Law

U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Act  of  1990  (Public  Law  101–606)  was  signed  into
law by President Bush on November 16, 1990. However, prior to passage of this leg-
islation  Congress  and  the  Reagan  and  Bush  Administrations  established  programs,
advisory bodies and mechanisms to undertake climate change research and develop
climate change policy.

The Climate Program preceded the USGCRP and was established by the National
Climate  Program  Act  (P.L.  95–367)  in  1978.  The  Climate  Program  was  intended  to
conduct  climate  research,  provide  climate  information,  and  to  support  policy  deci-
sions to ‘‘assist the Nation and the world to understand and respond to natural and
human-induced  climate  processes  and  their  implications’’  (P.L.  95–367,  § 3).  It  was
established as an interagency program coordinated through a National Climate Pro-
gram  Office  within  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA).
By  the  mid-1980s  Congress  began  to  consider  expanding  the  Climate  Program.  At
the time, the program was thought to be producing high quality science, but it was
not  providing  information  that  would  lead  to  policy  responses  to  threats  from  cli-
mate change.

In  the  1980s,  climate  change  policies  were  developed  within  the  White  House  al-
though  there  were  a  number  of  climate  change  advisory  groups  and  other  decision-
making groups within individual federal agencies. President Reagan established five
Councils in the White House. In 1985, these five Councils were consolidated within

two—a  Domestic  Policy  Council  and  an  Economic  Policy  Council.1 Climate  change
policy was discussed within the Domestic Policy Council and first came to the atten-
tion of this Council because of public attention being paid to Congressional hearings
being  held  to  air  concerns  of  the  scientific  community  about  the  potential  con-
sequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

In 1987, White House Science Advisor William Graham formed the Committee on
Earth  Sciences  within  the  Federal  Coordinating  Council  on  Science,  Engineering,
and  Technology  (FCCSET).  The  purpose  of  this  Committee  was  to  ‘‘increase  the
overall effectiveness and productivity of federal R&D efforts directed toward an un-
derstanding of the Earth as a global system’’ (CES 1987).

After  several  years  of  work,  Congress  passed,  and  President  Bush  signed,  The
U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Act  of  1990  (Public  Law  101–606)  which  established
the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  we  have  today.  The  Program  is  aimed
at understanding and responding to global change, including the cumulative effects
of  human  activities  and  natural  processes  on  the  environment,  and  to  promote  dis-
cussions  toward  international  protocols  in  global  change  research.  The  law  codified
the  interagency  structure  put  in  place  by  the  Reagan  Administration  and  defined
the  agencies  that  would  participate  in  the  program.  The  law  also  requires  develop-
ment  of  a  series  of  10-year  Plans  for  the  conduct  of  research  on  global  change  by
the  Federal  Government  to:  ‘‘advance  scientific  understanding  of  global  change  and
provide  usable  information  on  which  to  base  policy  decisions  related  to  global
change,’’  an  evaluation  of  the  Plan  by  the  National  Research  Council,  the  coordina-
tion  of  agency  budgets  for  global  change  research,  and  a  report  to  Congress  every
four years on the consequences of climate change.

While  research  Plans  have  been  produced  periodically  by  the  Program  and  re-
viewed  by  the  National  Research  Council  as  required  by  the  law,  the  production  of
periodic  assessments  of  the  findings  of  the  global  change  program  and  the  effects
of  global  change  on  natural  systems  and  sectors  of  the  economy  has  been  lacking.
There has been only one comprehensive report published since the beginning of the
program  satisfying  this  requirement  of  the  law—the  National  Assessment  on  Cli-
mate Change published in 2001.

assessment 

The  current  Administration  has  a  number  of  initiatives  that  are  related  to  past
efforts  conducted  under  the  Global  Change  Research  Act.  The  Climate  Change
Science  Program  (CCSP)  is  charged  with  integrating  science  on  global  change  pro-
duced  by  federal  agencies.  The  Program  is  producing  a  series  of  twenty  one  syn-
thesis 
(http://
www.climatescience.gov/).  The  Administration  also  has  a  Climate  Change  Research
Initiative (CCRI) and the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP), with NOAA
and  DOE  designated  as  the  lead  agencies,  respectively.  The  role  of  the  CCRI  is  to
reduce  the  significant  remaining  uncertainties  associated  with  understanding
human-induced climate change and facilitate full use of scientific information in pol-
icy  and  decision-making  on  possible  response  strategies  for  adaptation  and  mitiga-
tion. The role of the CCTP is to focus research and development efforts on the iden-
tification and development of technologies that will achieve the Administration’s cli-
mate change goals.

This  policy  has  three  basic  objectives:  slowing  the  growth  of  emissions,  strength-
ening science, technology and institutions, and enhancing international cooperation.
However,  in  1990,  total  U.S.  GHG  emissions  were  1,671  million  metric  tons  in  car-
bon  equivalents  (MMTCE).  In  2000,  total  U.S.  GHG  emissions  were  14.1  percent
above  1990  levels,  or  1,907  MMTCE.  Even  if  the  Administration’s  climate  change
goals are met, U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases will continue to grow.

The  requested  budget  for  the  major  climate  change  programs  in  2007  was  esti-
mated  by  the  Congressional  Research  Service  to  be  4.9  billion  dollars.2 The  partici-
pating  agencies  include  virtually  every  department  in  the  Federal  Government:
NASA, NSF, NOAA, DOE, USDA, DOI, HHS, EPA, the Smithsonian Institution and
DOD. The core agencies that have contributed to climate change science are NASA,
NOAA, NSF, and DOE.**

Current State Initiatives on Climate Change

Absent of coordinated federal direction on adapting to climate change impacts, re-
gions and states have taken action on their own to develop integrated plans to serve
multiple  user  communities.  Many  states  view  policies  that  address  climate  change
as  an  economic  opportunity,  rather  than  a  financial  burden.  These  states  are  posi-
tioning  themselves  as  leaders  in  emerging  markets  related  to  climate  change:  pro-
ducing and selling alternative fuels, exploring geographic specific adaptation strate-
gies,  attracting  climate  action  related  businesses,  and  selling  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sion reduction credits.

In  addition,  regional  efforts  have  been  successful  coordinating  initiatives  across
state boundaries. These regional plans eliminate duplication for states with similar
geographic makeup and help businesses by bringing greater uniformity and predict-
ability  to  State  rules  and  regulations.  For  example,  Powering  the  Plains  is  a  re-
gional  initiative,  involving  participants  from  the  Dakotas,  Minnesota,  Iowa,  and
Wisconsin, which aims to develop strategies, policies, and demonstration projects for
alternative energy sources. The Southwest Climate Change Initiative will allow Ari-
zona and New Mexico to work together to reduce greenhouse gases and address the
impacts  of  climate  change  in  the  region.  Other  such  projects  include  the  Northeast
Regional  Greenhouse  Gas  Initiative  (RGGI),  The  Clean  and  Diversified  Energy  Ini-
tiative  launched  by  the  Western  Governors  Association,  The  West  Coast  Governors’
Global Warming Initiative, and the New England Governors’ and Eastern Canadian
Premiers’  Climate  Action  Plan.  These  regional  and  State  programs  would  greatly
benefit  from  a  user-driven  Climate  Change  Research  Program,  as  established  in
H.R. 906.
The USGCRP under H.R. 906

The  USGCRP  has  continued  to  produce  high  quality  science  and  advance  our
knowledge of Earth’s climate system. However, the Program has not produced much
in  the  way  of  substantive  policy  analyses  or  produced  information  in  formats  that
are useful and accessible to the wide range of individuals and organizations who de-
sire  information  about  climate  variability  and  change  and  its  relationship  to  dif-
ferent  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere.  It  has  not  produced
information  that  will  assist  decision-makers  at  the  federal,  State,  and  local  level  in
the development of response, adaptation and mitigation strategies.

H.R.  906  directs  the  Program  to  develop  assessments  of  vulnerability  to  climate
change  and  to  develop  policy  assessments  that  will  evaluate  alternative  strategies
for  responding,  adapting,  and  mitigating  climate  change  that  is  projected  to  occur
under different atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

The components of the core science programs of the USGCRP continue to produce
useful  scientific  information  and  better,  more  refined  understanding  of  the  climate
system.  H.R.  906  does  not  eliminate  these  programs  and  activities.  Instead,  H.R.
906  shifts  the  emphasis  to  the  production  of  information  that  is  needed  to  develop
strategies to cope with current climate change and to mitigate greenhouse gas emis-
sions  to  reduce  the  magnitude  of  future  climate  impacts.  To  ensure  the  Program
produces policy-relevant information, H.R. 906 includes a review of the Program by
the National Governors Association’s Center for Best Practices.

The major scientific debate is settled. Climate change is occurring. It is impacting
our nation and the rest of the world and will continue to impact us into the future.
The USGCRP should move beyond an emphasis on addressing uncertainties and re-
fining  climate  science.  In  addition,  the  Program  needs  to  provide  information  that
supports  action  to  reduce  vulnerability  to  climate  and  other  global  changes  and  fa-
cilitates the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies that can be applied
here in the U.S. and in other vulnerable locations throughout the world.

Dr. Michael MacCracken is the Chief Scientist for Climate Change Programs with
the Climate Institute in Washington DC. He received his B.S. in Engineering degree
from Princeton University in 1964 and his Ph.D. degree in Applied Science from the
University of California Davis/Livermore in 1968. His research has included numer-
ical  modeling  of  various  causes  of  climate  change  (including  study  of  the  potential
climatic  effects  of  greenhouse  gases,  volcanic  aerosols,  land-cover  change,  and  nu-
clear  war)  and  of  factors  affecting  air  quality,  including  photochemical  pollution  in
the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and  sulfate  air  pollution  in  the  northeastern  United
States.

From 1993–2002, Dr. MacCracken was on assignment as senior global change sci-
entist  to  the  Office  of  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  (USGCRP)  and
served  as  its  first  Executive  Director  from  1993–1997.  From  1997–2001,  he  served

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  [Presiding]  The  Committee  will  come  to  order.
Good  afternoon,  everyone.  I  want  to  take  a  moment  to  welcome
you,  and  to  recognize  the  Subcommittee’s  hearing  called  today  to
receive  testimony  on  House  Resolution  906,  the  Global  Climate
Change Research Data and Management Act of 2007.

This  is  an  important  bill  that  will  help  us  to  better  address  cli-
mate  change  in  the  country,  and  I  want  to  thank  my  colleagues,
Representative  Mark  Udall  and  Ranking  Member  Bob  Inglis,  for
taking action and introducing this legislation.

Through  bills  like  H.R.  906,  Congress  is  starting  to  take  action
to  address  the  global  conundrum  that  is  climate  change.  It  is  not
an  exaggeration  to  say  that  the  world’s  future  depends  on  our  re-
sponse.  The  clock  is  ticking,  and  Congress  must  work  across  party
lines to pass concrete solutions as soon as possible. I think this bill
represents just that kind of needed bipartisanship.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Giffords follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE GABRIELLE GIFFORDS

Good  Afternoon.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  today’s  Subcommittee  hearing
called  to  receive  testimony  on  H.R.  906,  the  Global  Climate  Change  Research  Data
and  Management  Act  of  2007.  This  is  an  important  bill  that  will  help  us  to  better
address  climate  change  in  this  country,  and  I  want  to  thank  my  colleagues,  Rep-
resentative  Mark  Udall  and  Ranking  Member  Bob  Inglis,  for  taking  action  and  in-
troducing this legislation.

Through  bills  like  H.R.  906,  Congress  is  starting  to  take  action  to  address  the
global  conundrum  that  is  climate  change.  It  is  not  an  exaggeration  to  say  that  the
world’s  future  depends  on  our  response.  The  clock  is  ticking,  and  Congress  must
work  across  party  lines  to  pass  concrete  solutions  as  soon  as  possible.  I  think  this
bill represents just that kind of needed bipartisanship.

H.R.  906  would  reorient  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  to  produce
more user-friendly research and information. In addition, the Act would require the
Administration  to  identify  and  consult  with  members  of  the  user  community  in  de-
veloping the USGCRP research plan.

I believe that there is a real need to apply the improved knowledge we have about
climate to produce information that federal, State, and local officials, resource man-
agers,  and  businesses  can  use.  Managers  can  then  utilize  that  research  to  develop
response, adaptation, and mitigation strategies to reduce their regions’ vulnerability
to climate change.

Let’s look at how H.R. 906 could impact the West and Arizona specifically. Accord-
ing  to  the  IPCC  and  conversations  of  my  own  with  distinguished  climate  scientists
from the University of Arizona, I understand climate change could permanently re-
duce  the  flow  of  the  Colorado  River,  lead  to  more  severe,  prolonged  droughts,  and
cause water shortages for millions of people. More than 25 million people in Arizona
and six other states depend on the Colorado River for water and power. Forest fires
and  invasive  species  are  projected  to  increase,  and  we  could  face  an  influx  of  envi-
ronmental refugees from around the world. This would drastically affect our quality
of life.

What steps are currently being taken to develop response strategies to reduce the
Southwest’s  vulnerability  to  climate  change?  In  February  of  2006,  the  Governors  of
Arizona  and  New  Mexico  signed  an  agreement  to  create  the  Southwest  Climate
Change Initiative. Under the agreement, our states will collaborate to reduce green-
house  gas  emissions  and  address  the  impacts  of  climate  change  in  the  Southwest.
However,  in  order  to  do  that,  our  State  planners  need  relevant  data  to  make  the
best decisions on how to respond.

That’s  where  H.R.  906  comes  in.  Climate  change  is  happening  in  the  Southwest,
but Arizona can help moderate the change. With the new user-driven data provided
by  the  reorientation  of  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program,  State  legisla-
tures,  local  officials,  resource  managers,  and  businesses  could  all  begin  to  adjust
their plans to help Arizona avoid the worst of the impacts of climate change.

I  take  the  challenge  of  addressing  global  warming  very  seriously,  and  it  is  one
of my highest priorities in Congress. This will not only result in a stronger economy,
innovative technologies, and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs, but also
a more stable and sustainable world.

Ms. GIFFORDS. At this time, I would like to recognize the author
of the legislation, Representative Udall, for some opening remarks.
Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chairwoman.  Good  afternoon  to

the panel and my colleagues who have joined us here.

I  want  to  begin  by  thanking  Chairwoman  Giffords  for  holding
this  hearing  on  H.R.  906,  the  Global  Change  Research  and  Data
Management  Act  of  2007,  that  I  introduced  earlier  this  year,  with
my colleague and our Ranking Member, Mr. Inglis.

I  look  forward  to  working  together  as  this  bill  moves  forward.
The  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  has  been  in  existence
in  some  form  since  the  late  1970s.  Support  for  the  diverse  array
of  climate-related  sciences  in  the  11  agencies  of  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  has  expanded  our  knowledge  of  Earth’s  land,  water,  and
atmospheric systems. The outstanding science produced by our na-
tion’s  scientific  community  has  gained  the  U.S.  worldwide  recogni-
tion as a leader in climate science.

This research has been shared with the rest of the world through
international  scientific  organizations,  such  as  the  World  Meteoro-
logical  Organization  and  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change. The evolution of global science and the global change issue
sparked  the  need  to  make  changes  to  the  1970  National  Climate
Program Act, and gave us the Global Change Research Act of 1990.
It is now time for another adjustment to alter the focus of the pro-
gram governed by this law.

The debate about whether climate change is occurring, and about
whether human activity has contributed to it, is over. As our popu-
lation, economy, and infrastructure have grown, we have put more
pressure  on  the  natural  resources  we  all  depend  upon.  Each  year,
fires,  droughts,  hurricanes,  and  other  natural  events  remind  us  of
our  vulnerability  to  extreme  weather  and  climate  changes.  The
human and economic cost of these events is very high. With better
planning  and  implementation  of  adaptation  strategies,  these  costs
can be reduced.

For  all  of  these  reasons,  we  need  the  USGCRP  to  produce  more
information that is readily usable by decision-makers and resource
managers in government and in the private sector. People through-
out the country and in the rest of the world need information they
can  use  to  develop  response,  adaptation,  and  mitigation  strategies
to make our communities, our businesses, and our nation more re-
silient and less vulnerable to the changes that are inevitable.

We  must  also  move  aggressively  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions  if  we  are  to  avoid  future  increases  in  surface  temperature
that  will  trigger  severe  impacts  that  we  cannot  overcome  with  ad-
aptation  strategies.  We  need  economic  and  technical  information,
as  well  as  information  about  system  responses  and  climate  re-
sponses  to  different  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  at-
mosphere. The USGCRP should be the vehicle for providing this in-
formation.

Madam Chairwoman, we have a very distinguished panel of wit-
nesses here today, several of whom have a great deal of experience
with  the  USGCRP.  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony,  and  welcome
your  suggestions  for  improvements  to  H.R.  906.  Our  goal  is  to  en-

sure  that  the  excellent  science  produced  by  this  program  is  ex-
panded and translated into user-friendly information to deliver the
solutions  our  nation  needs  to  address  the  challenge  of  climate
change.

Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good afternoon. Thank you, Chairwoman Giffords for holding this hearing on H.R.
906,  the  Global  Change  Research  and  Data  Management  Act  of  2007  that  I  intro-
duced earlier this year with my colleague and our Ranking Member, Representative
Inglis. I look forward to working together as this bill moves forward.

The  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  (USGCRP)  has  been  in  existence  in
some  form  since  the  late  1970s.  Support  for  the  diverse  array  of  climate-related
sciences in the eleven agencies of the Federal Government has expanded our knowl-
edge of Earth’s land, water, and atmospheric systems. The outstanding science pro-
duced  by  our  nation’s  scientific  community  has  gained  the  U.S.  worldwide  recogni-
tion  as  a  leader  in  climate  science.  This  scientific  work  has  been  shared  with  the
rest  of  the  world  through  international  scientific  organizations  such  as  the  World
Meteorological  Organization  and  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change.
The  evolution  of  global  science  and  the  global  change  issue  sparked  the  need  to
make  changes  to  the  1978  National  Climate  Program  Act,  and  gave  us  the  Global
Change  Research  Act  of  1990.  It  is  now  time  for  another  adjustment  to  alter  the
focus of the program governed by this law.

The debate, about whether climate change is occurring and about whether human
activity  has  contributed  to  it,  is  over.  As  our  population,  economy,  and  infrastruc-
ture have grown, we have put more pressure on the natural resources we all depend
upon. Each year, fires, droughts, hurricanes, and other natural events remind us of
our  vulnerability  to  extreme  weather  and  climate  changes.  The  human  and  eco-
nomic  cost  of  these  events  is  very  high.  With  better  planning  and  implementation
of adaptation strategies these costs can be reduced.

For  all  of  these  reasons,  we  need  the  USGCRP  to  produce  more  information  that
is  readily  usable  by  decision-makers  and  resource  managers  in  government  and  in
the private sector. People throughout this country and in the rest of the world need
information they can use to develop response, adaptation, and mitigation strategies
to  make  our  communities,  our  businesses,  and  our  nation  more  resilient  and  less
vulnerable to the changes that are inevitable.

We  must  also  move  aggressively  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  if  we  are  to
avoid  future  increases  in  surface  temperature  that  will  trigger  severe  impacts  that
we cannot overcome with adaptation strategies. We need economic and technical in-
formation  as  well  as  information  about  system  responses  and  climate  responses  to
different  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere.  The  USGCRP
should be the vehicle for providing this information.

We have a very distinguished panel of witnesses here today, several of whom have
a  great  deal  of  experience  with  the  USGCRP.  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony  and
welcome  your  suggestions  for  improvements  to  H.R.  906.  Our  goal  is  to  ensure  the
excellent  science  produced  by  this  program  is  expanded  and  translated  into  user-
friendly  information  to  deliver  the  solutions  our  nation  needs  to  address  the  chal-
lenge of climate change.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Udall.
And  now,  I  would  like  to  recognize  our  distinguished  Ranking
Member,  Mr.  Inglis  of  South  Carolina,  for  his  opening  statement.
Mr. INGLIS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Chair for holding
the  hearing,  and  Mr.  Udall,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  work
with him on this bill.

This  is  an  opportunity  of  bipartisan  cooperation,  and  I  think  it
makes sense, because this is a bill that can increase our awareness
and  our  preparation  for  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  Of  course,
I hope we can also move forward and develop a consensus on miti-
gation,  as  well,  and  the  necessary  start  of  that  is  the  attempt  to
build consensus, and so, I thank Mr. Udall for doing that and pur-

suing this bill, and I am happy to be with him on the bill, and very
excited about hearing from the witnesses here today.

And  you  know,  our  current  climate  science  programs  at  the  Na-
tional  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  and  the  National
Science  Foundation  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Ad-
ministration and the U.S. Geological Survey have made great gains
in  deepening  our  understanding  of  global  climate  change,  from
what  is  causing  it,  to  how  our  country  and  others  might  be  af-
fected.

The  sheer  volume  of  data  calls  for  an  intelligent  data  manage-
ment system which is designed to fulfill the needs of its users. The
program must meet the additional challenge of presenting the data
in  a  relevant  form  to  users  that  have  non-scientific  backgrounds,
like State and local government operators.

So,  in  South  Carolina,  I  have  been  hearing  from  fishermen  and
hunters, who are particularly concerned about fish and animal pop-
ulation  changes  that  could  threaten  our  local  ecotourism  busi-
nesses. South Carolina’s tourism business is actually the largest in-
dustry  in  our  state,  especially  at  our  coast,  and  so,  we  are  aware
of  the  goose  that  is  laying  the  golden  eggs  down  at  our  coast,  and
we want to make sure that it continues to lay them there.

So,  this  bill,  as  I  say,  the  opportunities  for  building  awareness
and  preparation,  I  think  will  help,  and  I  am  happy  to  be  part  of
it and happy to hear from the witnesses, and I yield back.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Good  afternoon.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Chairwoman,  for  holding  this  hearing  on  ways
we  might  improve  our  climate  science  programs  to  make  local  users  a  part  of  the
process.

Our  current  climate  science  programs  at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Aero-
nautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  the  United  States  Geological  Survey
(USGS)  and  other  agencies  have  made  great  gains  in  deepening  our  understanding
of  global  change—from  what  is  causing  it  to  how  our  country  and  others  might  be
affected. The sheer volume of data calls for an intelligent data management system,
designed  to  fulfill  the  needs  of  its  users.  The  program  must  meet  the  additional
challenge of presenting the data in a relevant form to users that have non-scientific
backgrounds, such as State and local governments.

In  South  Carolina,  I’ve  been  hearing  from  fisherman  and  hunters  who  are  con-
cerned about fish and animal population changes that could threaten local eco-tour-
ism  businesses.  South  Carolina’s  tourism  industry,  the  largest  economic  generator
in  the  state,  will  need  more  information  about  changes  to  the  coast  as  they  plan
for  the  future.  These  folks  will  also  need  the  ability  to  let  the  climate  programs
know what’s useful and where they require additional information.

I  believe  we  can  find  a  bipartisan  consensus  to  take  action  on  improving  our  cli-
mate science programs. This issue has the potential to affect all of us and we must
ensure that local users are informed and have a say in the process to get the infor-
mation they need.

I’m pleased that Dr. James Mahoney could be with us today. Dr. Mahoney is the
former  Director  of  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  and  former  Deputy
Administrator  for  NOAA.  His  academic  and  professional  experience  makes  him  a
valuable  addition  to  this  panel.  I’m  encouraged  by  the  constructive  feedback  in  his
written testimony, and I thank him for coming to share his insight.

Thank  you  again  for  holding  this  hearing,  Ms.  Chairwoman,  and  I  look  forward
to hearing from all of our distinguished witnesses as to how we can most effectively
structure our climate science programs.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Inglis.

I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  all  additional  opening  statements
submitted  by  Subcommittee  Members  be  included  in  the  record.
Without objection, so ordered.

It  is  my  pleasure  now  to  introduce  this  excellent  panel  of  wit-
nesses that we have with us here this afternoon. First, we have Dr.
Michael  MacCracken,  who  is  the  Chief  Scientist  for  Climate
Change  Programs  at  the  Climate  Institute  here  in  Washington,
D.C. Dr. MacCracken served as the Executive Director for the U.S.
Global  Change  Research  Program  from  1993  to  1997,  and  he  has
brought with him a stack of documentation that he can’t leave with
us,  but  I  am  sure  he  is  going  to  speak  about  in  terms  of  the  data
that exists.

Second,  we  have  Dr.  Jack  Fellows,  who  is  the  Vice  President  for
Corporate  Affairs  at  the  University  Center  for  Atmospheric  Re-
search  in  Boulder,  Colorado,  and  the  Director  of  UCAR  Office  of
Programs.  Dr.  Fellows  helped  to  initiate  the  U.S.  Global  Change
Research  Program  when  he  worked  in  the  Executive  Office  of  the
President’s Office of Management and Budget. Thank you for being
here, Dr. Fellows.

Dr.  James  Mahoney  currently  serves  as  an  environmental  con-
sultant, providing scientific and professional advice to a number of
organizations.  From  April  2,  2002  to  March  30,  2006,  he  was  As-
sistant  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere  and
Deputy  Administrator  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric
Organization. During this period, Dr. Mahoney served as the Direc-
tor  of  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program.  It  is  so  terrific
having  you  here  today.  We  had  a  chance  to  speak  a  little  bit  ear-
lier.  We  are  thrilled  that  you  are  here  with  us.  Thank  you,  Dr.
Mahoney.

Mr. Franklin Nutter is the President of the Reinsurance Associa-
tion of America, and a member of the University Center for Atmos-
pheric  Research’s  Board  of  Trustees.  Good  to  see  you,  Mr.  Nutter.
Dr. Philip Mote is a Washington State climatologist, and an Affil-
iate Professor at the University of Washington. His research has fo-
cused  on  Northwest  climate  and 
its  effects  on  snowpack,
streamflow, and forest fires. Thank you, Dr. Mote.

And  Ms.  Sarah  Bittleman  is  the  Director  of  the  Governor  of  Or-
egon’s  Washington,  D.C.  office,  and  is  testifying  today  on  behalf  of
the Western Governors Association, and I know that Arizona’s Gov-
ernor, Janet Napolitano, obviously is very active with that associa-
tion as well.

So,  welcome  to  all  of  you.  Let  me  just  say  that  we  do  have  a  se-
ries,  a  short  series  of  votes  that  we  don’t  know  when  they  will
come,  but  we  believe  that  we  should  be  adjourned  by  4:00.  So,  my
goal  is  to  make  sure  that  the  testimony  is  limited  to  five  minutes,
which  goes  by  very  quickly,  and  you  will  see  the  indication,  in
terms of the lights.

It is important that we get through, because we have, obviously,
a  panel  of  wonderful  witnesses.  We  have  got  questions,  but  I  just
want  to  make  sure  that  we  don’t  lose  Members,  because  I  know
that  we  are  going  to  be  leaving  for  the  weekend,  and  I  want  to
make sure that we keep everyone here as long as we can.

Your  written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record  for  the
hearing,  and  when  all  six  of  you  have  completed  your  testimony,

we  will  begin  with  questions,  which  will  be,  again,  for  five  minute
increments.

So, Dr. MacCracken, if we can begin with you, please.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  MICHAEL  C.  MACCRACKEN,  PRESIDENT,
THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF METEOROLOGY AND
ATMOSPHERIC  SCIENCES  OF  THE  INTERNATIONAL  UNION
OF  GEODESY  AND  GEOPHYSICS;  CHIEF  SCIENTIST  FOR  CLI-
MATE  CHANGE  PROGRAMS,  CLIMATE  INSTITUTE,  WASH-
INGTON, DC
Dr. MACCRACKEN. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
I was asked to address two questions during my testimony, hav-
ing to do with lessons learned during the National Assessment that
took  place,  and  what  are  some  specific  tasks  necessary  to  get  an
ongoing assessment process.

I also want to just say a few words about the program in general.
I  think  the  USGCRP  is  a  very  unique  activity.  It  is  trying  to  get
agencies working together. I came in as the first Executive Director
of  the  office  to  get  the  ten  agencies  really  participating  and  work-
ing  together,  and  my  job  description  said  and  you  don’t  have  con-
trol of the money, so you have to make it happen, which is by driv-
ing it with ideas.

I think a great deal was accomplished with some inspired leader-
ship.  There  were  international  field  programs  that  combined  the
activities  of  NASA  with  their  satellites  and  NOAA  with  their  air-
craft and ships, and NSF with their capabilities, and so, we learned
a lot about El Nin˜ o and the ozone hole and things.

What  has  happened  since,  unfortunately,  even  though  there  are
more and more questions coming up, the budget has been dropping.
The  proposal,  I  think,  for  Fiscal  2008  is  about  25  percent  below  in
sort  of  even  dollars  what  it  was  in  the  1990s,  even  though  there
are  more  questions.  And  so,  we  are  ending  up  doing  less.  So,  I
think  to  get  the  program  going,  what  is  needed  is  some  highly
qualified leadership to get the funding up again, and then, to work
hard on the assessment activity.

So,  for  the  assessment  activity,  what  I  brought  here,  and  what
the  Chairwoman  commented  upon,  was  the  reports  that  came  out
from the National Assessment, which you have heard. There aren’t
many  places  where  they  are  compiled.  This  is  one  of  the  few  sets.
But  what  was  talked  about,  and  what  is  sometimes  talked  about
in  the  bill  is  the  report  that  is  delivered  to  Congress,  and  that
turned  out  to  be  this  report,  and  then,  there  was  a  supporting
thicker report.

But  at  the  same  time,  what  was  going  on  was  a  process  all
around  the  country.  There  were  sort  of  20  regions  that  held  work-
shops.  There  were  five  sectoral  studies,  and  so,  each  of  those  was
an  ongoing  activity,  and  so,  there  is  Alaska,  and  there  is  health,
and  there  were  forests,  and  Great  Lakes,  and  a  whole  host  of  ac-
tivities  going  on  there,  because  global  changes  start  at  the  global
scale. When you look at it, how we are changing the global atmos-
phere,  impacts  start  at  the  local  scale,  and  you  just  have  to  have
the local people involved.

There  was  an  EPA  assessment  that  went  on  in  the  late  ’80s,
where they tried to basically study five representative regions, one

of  them  being  California,  where  I  was.  They  appointed  a  panel  of,
I  think,  12  or  13  scientists.  It  had  one  Californian  on  it.  It  got  no
attention  whatsoever  in  the  state.  What  happened  in  this  last  as-
sessment go round was the activity was based at the University of
California  Santa  Barbara,  and  when  they  had  the  workshop,  they
had  a  majority  of  members  of  the  Energy  Commission  there,  the
California Air Resources Board, and a whole bunch of other groups.
They  involved  local  people.  And  California’s  effort  took  off,  even
though there wasn’t enough money provided to them to, in the end,
publish  their  report.  They  got  so  many  people  going,  and  so  many
people interested in the critical problems.

So,  I  think  it  is  really  important  to  do  that.  There  are  just  all
kinds  of  people  who  are  interested.  Planners  want  to  know  about
what  is  going  to  happen  to  the  likelihood  of  floods.  Farmers  and
hunters  and  fishermen  in  South  Carolina  want  to  know  what  is
going  to  happen  to  the  temperature  of  the  streams,  or  the  state  of
the  forests,  and  if  they  are  going  to  dry  out  so  much  that  you  get
fires. There is just a lot of information that can be provided.

Indeed, there are uncertainties, and there is a lot more research
to  be  done,  but  there  is  an  awful  lot  of  guidance  that  one  can  give
with  respect  to  these  activities.  And  so,  in  the  testimony,  I  go
through  a  number  of  steps  that  I  think  need  to  be  taken.  One  is
to  be  make  sure  that  you  call  not  just  for  a  report  for  Congress,
but  for  a  capability  for  the  country  to  address  and  face  up  to  the
impacts of the issue. Insist, as you do, that there is stakeholder in-
volvement.  Insist,  as  you  do,  to  use  the  words  ‘‘global  change’’  in-
stead of ‘‘climate change.’’ That is a subtle difference, but it means
you  are  really  going  to  do  climate  change  in  the  context  of  every-
thing else, not just do climate change all by itself, which isn’t par-
ticularly useful. Do consider mitigation and adaptation.

I think it is going to be important to find a way to provide fund-
ing that goes for assessment. As we were dealing with the agencies,
it was hard for them to consider assessment research, and yet, the
definition  in  the  Global  Change  Act  and  in  this  bill  have  assess-
ment as under research. That doesn’t work very well. Some of them
legally  say  they  can’t  do  it,  and  so,  I  think  you  are  really  going  to
have to find a way to provide separate funding.

I think there needed to be these strong regional components, and
we tried to work up to 20. We ended up being able to fund 15, and
couldn’t find funding for sort of the other five, that we thought cov-
ered  the  country.  And  there  were  a  couple  of  reports,  like  the  one
in  the  Southwest  for  Native  peoples,  that  the  report  got  all  done,
but  there  was  never  funding  around  to  publish  it.  It  was  very  un-
fortunate at the end.

So, we need, I think, some regional centers. I think it is also im-
portant  to  look  nationally,  and  look  at  some  sectors,  so  we  looked
at  agriculture  and  water  resources  and  human  health,  and  coasts,
and  forests.  And  so,  there  are  those,  but  there  are  a  whole  host  of
additional  ones  to  be  looking  at,  the  rural  communities,  extreme
events,  and  other  things.  And  then  have  an  international,  I  mean
an independent synthesis that can be done, so—the signal is down
there, but——

Let  me  just  conclude  by  saying  I  think  a  lot  can  be  done  in  a
year,  but  you  can’t  get  all  the  way  there  in  a  year,  and  if  you  try

and  do  it  all  in  a  year,  you  won’t  be  doing  the  kind  of  effort  that
you really need to have happen.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL C. MACCRACKEN

Introduction

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
participate  in  today’s  hearing  on  H.R.  906,  the  Global  Change  Research  and  Data
Management Act of 2007. I am honored to testify before you today in both my capac-
ity,  since  2002,  as  Chief  Scientist  for  Climate  Change  Programs  at  the  Climate  In-
stitute1 here in Washington, D.C., and as the executive director of the Office of the
U.  S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  (USGCRP)  from  1993  to  1997  and  of
USGCRP’s National Assessment Coordination Office from 1997–2001.2 My detail as
senior scientist with the Office of the USGCRP as senior scientist for climate change
concluded in September 2002.

Prior  to  my  detail  from  the  University  of  California’s  Lawrence  Livermore  Na-
tional  Laboratory  (LLNL)  to  the  Office  of  the  USGCRP  in  1993,  my  research  at
LLNL beginning in 1968 focused on computer simulation of climate change and air
pollution.  In  addition,  from  1974–1987  I  served  as  deputy  division  leader  and  from
1987–1993 as division leader of LLNL’s Atmospheric and Geophysical Sciences Divi-
sion.  While  at  LLNL,  I  gained  valuable  experience  in  facilitating  interagency  co-
operation  by  leading  or  co-leading  cooperative  research  programs  among  the  DOE
national  laboratories  and  across  the  campuses  of  the  University  of  California.  In
none of these cases, including with the Office of the USGCRP and NACO, did I have
control  of  the  funding  to  force  cooperation;  leadership,  in  each  case,  was  primarily
through the offering of ideas that would attract the various participants to work co-
operatively together. A biographical sketch is appended to this statement.

In inviting me to testify, I was asked to address two questions:

1. What lessons did you learn from your experience as Executive Director of the
National Assessment Coordination Office of the U.S. Global Change Research
Program  about  the  importance  of  regional,  State  and  local  participation  of  a
National Assessment?

2. What  are  the  specific  tasks  necessary  to  develop  an  on-going  dynamic  Na-
tional  Assessment  process  and  what  financial  resources  are  needed  to  sup-
port them?

In  addressing  these  questions,  I  will  also  be  drawing  on  my  experiences  partici-
pating  in  various  ways  in  the  assessment  activities  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel
on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  the  Arctic  Climate  Impact  Assessment,  the  City  of
Aspen, and related efforts.

1 The  Climate  Institute  is  a  non-partisan,  non-governmental  501(c)(3)  organization  that  was
established under the leadership of John Topping in 1986 to heighten national and international
awareness of climate change and to identify practical ways for dealing with it, both through pre-
paring  for  and  responding  to  the  ongoing  and  prospective  changes  in  climate  and  by  reducing
emissions  and  slowing  the  long-term  rate  of  change.  These  goals  are  pursued,  among  other
ways,  through  preparation  of  papers,  presentation  of  talks,  and  organization  of  symposia,  con-
ferences,  roundtables,  and  special  briefings.  These  have  been  carried  out  not  only  in  the  U.S.,
but  also  in  Canada,  Australia,  Japan,  Europe,  and  more  than  two-dozen  developing  countries.
To  accomplish  this,  the  Climate  Institute  taps  into  its  vast  network  of  experts  and  alliances  in
the U.S. and internationally. In all of these efforts, the Institute strives to be a source of objec-
tive and reliable information, promoting global climate protection through practical and coopera-
tive  approaches.  The  Board  of  Directors,  to  which  I  was  recently  elected,  governs  the  activities
of  the  Climate  Institute.  The  Board,  which  is  currently  led  by  Mr.  William  Nitze,  is  made  up
of  academic,  business,  environmental  and  scientific  leaders  from  several  nations,  and  the  Insti-
tute’s  Board  of  Advisors,  which  plays  a  critical  advisory  role,  is  also  very  broadly  based.  The
Climate  Institute  receives  financial  support  from  membership,  private  and  corporate  contribu-
tions,  grants,  and  contractual  services  for  government  agencies,  nonprofit  organizations,  and
publication sales. My service with the Climate Institute has been on a volunteer basis.

2 The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established by the Global Change
Research  Act  of  1990.  Throughout  my  detail  with  the  USGCRP,  it  was  managed  by  the  inter-
agency Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR), which was made up of research pro-
gram managers from NSF, NASA, NOAA, DOE, EPA, DOI, USDA, HHS, DOD, and the Smith-
sonian  Institution  plus  representatives  from  OSTP,  OMB,  and,  on  occasion,  other  offices  of  the
Executive  Office  of  the  President.  To  facilitate  interagency  research  cooperation,  the  SGCR  es-
tablished  the  Office  of  the  USGCRP  in  1993,  which  has  continued  since  2002  as  the  Office  of
the Climate Change Science Program. The National Assessment Coordination Office was created
by the SGCR in 1997 and then closed in 2001 at the end of the U.S. National Assessment.

Facilitating  an  Integrated  National  Research  and  Assessment  Program  on

Global Change

16

The  Global  Change  Research  Act  of  1990  (GCRA90)  is  relatively  unique  in  its  es-
tablishment of an interagency research program; when effectively directed, the coop-
erative  efforts  led  to  very  positive  results  and  accomplishments.  Growing  out  of
interagency  activities  and  planning  beginning  in  about  1988  (with  roots  reaching
back even further), establishment of the USGCRP energized cooperative interagency
activities,  with  each  agency  bringing  their  strengths  to  the  collaborative  effort,
thereby  creating  an  impressive  and  comprehensive  national  and  international  re-
search program. GCRA90’s requirement to prepare an integrated research plan and
OMB’s  requirement  that  the  agencies  collectively  approve  the  budget  increments  of
any  particular  agency  served  to  encourage  cooperation  and  maintain  budget  dis-
cipline in the early days of the program.

During  the  1990s,  the  collective  interagency  budget  approached  $2B  a  year,  and
significant  research  efforts  could  be  accomplished.  For  example,  international  field
programs  that  combined  the  satellite  and  other  capabilities  of  NASA,  the  aircraft
and  ship  capabilities  of  NOAA,  the  university  research  and  field  experiment  capa-
bilities  of  NSF,  and  similar  contributions  from  other  countries  led  to  much  more
comprehensive and complete data sets for analysis by scientists in all nations, thus
promoting, at lower cost to the US, more complete and faster insight into such phe-
nomena  as  the  El  Nin˜ o,  the  ozone  hole,  oceanic  uptake  of  carbon,  and  more.  Im-
provement of climate models and transfer of such models to the new generations of
massively  parallel  computers  was  accelerated  by  combining  the  strengths  of  DOE
and  its  laboratories  with  the  modeling  expertise  of  NSF,  NASA,  and  NOAA—each
effort  prompting  the  others  to  do  better.  The  sharing  of  data  and  model  results  al-
lowed other agencies to draw on the results for studies of ecosystem change, hydrol-
ogy, agriculture, and more. There were many other examples that, when the overall
effort  was  adequately  funded,  significantly  advanced  scientific  understanding  in
ways that have and can continue to benefit society.

With more and more scientific questions coming up, however, the budget was held
to  roughly  level  dollars  starting  in  the  mid  1990s  as  a  step  to  bring  the  overall
budget deficit under control, leaving only the scientific benefits of working together
in  win-win  ways  and  Executive  Office  encouragement  to  drive  interagency  coopera-
tion.  Even  though  budgets  were  tight,  the  agencies  recognized  the  importance  of
having  an  assessment  activity  and  jointly  sponsored  the  U.S.  National  Assessment
from 1997–2001.

With  the  GCRP  budget  becoming  significantly  smaller3 (e.g.,  within  EPA  and
NASA), with the erosionary effects of inflation, with the significance of the decrease
being  somewhat  hidden  by  changing  the  set  of  ongoing  agency  activities  included
in the USGCRP budget (e.g., within NOAA), and with the CCSP having less knowl-
edgeable and inspirational leadership, much less is seeming to be accomplished. Sci-
entists  are  spending  far  too  much  of  their  time  writing  proposals,  fewer  young  sci-
entists are being supported, the observation program is deteriorating, agencies have
been very slow to get activities going on important new questions (e.g., research on
hurricanes  and  their  relationship  to  climate  change),  the  U.S.  is  falling  behind  the
rest of the world and not doing its share in supporting cooperative international re-
search  programs,  and  the  overall  national  assessment  activity  is  far  below  what  it
was  and  should  be  given  the  situation  being  faced  by  the  American  public.  While
there  is  indeed  still  much  research  to  be  done  (enumerated  most  recently  in  the
Strategic  Plan  for  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  completed  in  2003),
and  I  certainly  support  sustaining  a  strong  interagency  research  program  with
greater funding, just listing what should be done is not enough.

In addition, the Strategic Plan did not even call for a comprehensive decision sup-
port  program,  which  is  both  very  disappointing  and  a  real  disservice  to  those  who
are  experiencing  climate  change  now  and  who  will  be  exposed  to  much  greater
change in years to come. The Administration is not even providing sufficient support
to  investigate  the  uncertainties  that  it  claims  are  important,  much  less  the  many
areas deemed important by the national and international scientific community and
the public, just at a time when the pace of climate change and its impacts are accel-
erating.

The  main  change  that  is  needed,  in  my  view,  is  highly  qualified  leadership,  res-
toration of the very strong research effort that had been going on, and a significant
commitment  to  openly,  forthrightly,  and  expeditiously  provide  the  best  possible  in-
formation to the American public through a comprehensive decision support and as-

sessment  activity.  Interagency  cooperation  can  be  encouraged  by  ensuring  each
agency has a strong research program and then, for interagency activities, allocating
responsibilities across the agencies, with each taking on a proportional share of the
tasks  that  it  can  capably  undertake  and  fund.  Shared  responsibility  has  the  effect
of  ensuring  a  real  stake  in  the  collective  effort  by  all  of  the  agencies.  Although  I
have  been  disappointed  in  OSTP’s  leadership  for  the  past  few  years,  my  rec-
ommendation is nonetheless maintain responsibility for the interagency coordination
under  OSTP  and  the  science  adviser,  and  to  keep  the  research  on  climate  change
science  separate  from  that  on  energy  technologies  to  avoid  potential  biases  and  to
ensure effective management.
Building a Useful and Effective National Assessment Capability

Assessments are too often thought of only as reports, as, for example, the assess-
ment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the WMO
and  UNEP  reports  on  Stratospheric  Ozone,  the  Arctic  Climate  Impact  Assessment
(ACIA), and the US National Assessment. Indeed, GCRA90 and H.R. 906 both focus
on the delivery of a report to Congress.

For  the  assessment  activity  to  be  useful,  however,  it  has  been  widely  recognized
for  some  time  that  a  much  grander  vision  and  process  is  needed,  both  in  terms  of
the  set  of  stakeholders  that  are  included  and  in  establishing  the  type  and  scope  of
activities  that  need  to  be  undertaken.  While  provision  of  information  to  Congress
to  support  policy  development  is  certainly  important,  preparing  for  and  adapting
and responding to the impacts of climate change must start locally and regionally—
each  region  is  distinct,  and  each  type  of  impact  manifests  itself  in  different  ways
in different places and for different sectors of the economy. While there are certainly
some  areas  where  national  policy  steps  are  warranted,  there  will  be  many  where
individuals,  public  and  private  sector  organizations,  local  communities,  states,  and
regions  will  need  to  respond.  USGCRP  activities  need  to  serve  all  of  these  scales
and  stakeholders,  not  dictating  what  policies  to  follow,  but  providing  information
and capabilities needed by those experiencing the impacts so that they can prepare
for and adapt and respond to future conditions.

Local  planners  will  want  information  on  likely  changes  in  precipitation  amount
and flooding rains; farmers and farm cooperatives will want information on changes
in  season  length  and  temperature,  not  just  for  their  own  farms,  but  for  those  of
their local and distant competitors; coastal zone managers will want information on
likely  changes  in  sea  level,  storms,  estuarine  temperatures,  and  more;  water  re-
source  managers  will  want  information  on  likely  changes  in  snowpack  and  runoff,
and  the  chance  of  floods  and  drought;  community  health  planners  will  want  infor-
mation  on  changes  in  location  of  freezing  conditions  and  the  frequency  of  extreme
heat  waves;  industry  will  want  information  on  changes  in  extremes  that  might  af-
fect  their  businesses  and  shipping;  those  preparing  environmental  impact  state-
ments will want information on the degree of change in a particular location; those
doing economic analyses will want information across the region, and lots more.

In  addition  to  providing  information  for  stakeholders,  the  program  needs  to  have
an associated outreach and educational activity, helping to inform people about the
changes  ahead  so  that  they  can  make  decisions  that  will  be  robust  over  time  and
not lead to wasteful investments. As for other parts of the economy and society, in-
formation, even somewhat uncertain information, can be very valuable. In that Con-
gress  created  the  Global  Change  Research  Act  as  an  application-oriented  research
effort,  I  believe  that  the  USGCRP  has  an  obligation  to  make  information  available
as it is produced, and not hold back such information until the changes being stud-
ied  have  occurred  or  the  very  high  degree  of  confidence  that  the  scientific  commu-
nity ultimately strives for has been obtained.
Reflections on the U.S. National Assessment Experience (1997–2001)

Over  the  four-year  period,  significant  progress  was  made  in  moving  toward  cre-
ating  a  broad  and  comprehensive  National  Assessment  capability.  We  realized  that
we  needed  to  create  opportunities  for  real  people  (referred  to  collectively  as  stake-
holders) to meet with scientists and specialists to learn about and discuss the infor-
mation  that  the  research  is  providing,  have  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions  and
to  contribute  their  detailed  knowledge  and  expertise,  get  information  in  the  form
and  type  that  they  need  to  make  their  own  analyses,  and  to  make  their  own  judg-
ments  about  whether  the  degree  of  confidence  and  uncertainty  that  scientists  have
in this information will make it useful to them.

Certainly, a top-down effort by USGCRP could set the process in motion by help-
ing to sponsor meetings and by carrying out illustrative analyses of the larger-scale
impacts. However, top-down reports tend to lack the detailed, local knowledge of an
area and generally inadequately treat the social, economic, and demographic issues

that  would  be  expected  to  make  a  climate  impact  report  of  real  relevance  to  city
and  regional  planners;  reports  about  local  issues  published  by  agencies  in  Wash-
ington are just not perceived to have the credibility of reports coming from local ex-
perts. Quite clearly, strong bottom-up regional efforts based at local academic insti-
tutions are much more credible than national level efforts, especially when analyses
are done at local to regional scales by local and regional experts.

A second approach to evaluating impacts is to look nationally, or even internation-
ally where appropriate, at particular economic or resource sectors. For many sectors,
national policies exist and commercial entities are very active or interested, making
a  national  perspective  most  appropriate.  As  a  result,  the  National  Assessment  set
up  a  series  of  sectoral  studies.  Because  many  of  those  in  industry  consider  their
ability  to  adapt  and  prepare  for  climatic  fluctuations  and  changes  a  component  of
their  proprietary  business  information,  it  also  became  clear  that,  for  some  types  of
sectoral  studies,  the  assessment  would  need  to  be  left  to  the  private  sector  (and  in
the  field  of  weather-related  issues,  there  is  already  a  strong  private  sector  capa-
bility).  Industry  participants  might  well  want  to  receive  information,  but  did  not
want to have to explain their requests.

So,  building  on  experiences  from  already  ongoing  efforts  by  NOAA  to  help  water
resource  managers  and  others  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  make  use  of  the  improving
predictability  of  El  Nin˜ o  and  La  Nin˜ a  events,  the  SGCR  decided  to  create  an  ongo-
ing,  nationally  distributed  assessment  capability,  not  only  to  prepare  the  periodic
national-level  report,  but  to  also  provide  ongoing  decision  support  and  assessment
capabilities to both regional and sectoral stakeholders.

During  1997  and  1998,  the  USGCRP  agencies  sponsored  20  primarily  university-
based teams across the country to organize workshops that would provide an oppor-
tunity  for  the  scientific  and  stakeholder  communities  to  come  together.4 Guidance
was  also  given  to  make  sure  that  a  broad  array  of  stakeholders  were  invited,  and
the OSTP Director sent letters to each governor and each Member of Congress from
the  area  inviting  their  participation.  Each  workshop  posed  a  set  of  four  questions5
as a way of seeking to identify the most important impacts likely to affect each par-
ticular region.

Based on the issues identified and the capabilities for analyzing and summarizing
the  likely  impacts  in  these  areas,  fifteen  of  the  groups  were  funded  to  conduct  re-
gional  assessments,6 and  of  these,  all  but  three  completed  their  studies  over  the
next couple of years and, in addition to significant outreach to regional stakeholders,
published reports summarizing likely impacts.7

Following  a  national-level  workshop  in  the  fall  of  1997  and  in  response  to  guid-
ance  from  the  director  of  the  OSTP  regarding  fulfillment  of  the  GCRA90  require-
ment for a national assessment, the USGCRP agencies established the National As-
sessment  Synthesis  Team  (NAST)  as  a  federal  advisory  committee  in  early  1998.
Working with the agencies, NAST organized sectoral assessment teams covering ag-
riculture,  forests,  human  health,  water  resources,  and  coastal  area  and  marine  re-
sources.  Each  of  the  five  sectoral  teams  was  based  at  a  university  and  co-chaired
by  a  university  and  government  laboratory  scientist.  While  it  was  recognized  that
there were additional sectoral topics meriting coverage (and even mentioned specifi-
cally  in  GCRA90),  the  particular  choices  were  made  because  it  was  recognized  that
other  sectoral  topics  would  likely  depend  on  the  results  from  these  areas  (e.g.,  as-
sessing  impacts  on  the  energy  sector  would  require  estimates  of  changes  in  water
resources).  In  addition,  because  the  intent  was  that  assessment  activities  would  be
ongoing, holding off for a few years seemed prudent, especially because the most im-

4 Workshops  were  held  covering  the  following  areas:  New  England  and  Upstate  New  York,
Metropolitan  East  Coast,  Mid-Atlantic,  Central  and  Southern  Appalachians,  Southeast,  South
Atlantic  Coast  and  Caribbean,  Great  Lakes,  Eastern  Midwest,  Northern  Great  Plains,  Central
Great  Plains,  Southern  Great  Plains,  Rocky  Mountains/Great  Basin,  Southwest-Rio  Grande
Basin,  Southwest-Colorado  River  Basin,  California,  Pacific  Northwest,  Alaska,  Pacific  Islands,
and Native Peoples/Native Homelands.

5 1.  What  are  the  long-term  environmental  and  resource  problems  now  faced  in  the  region?
2. How would climate change amplify or moderate them or introduce new stresses? 3. What fur-
ther  information  is  needed  to  address  these  questions?  4.  What  win-win  strategies  might  help
to address the problems being faced?

6 The  five  areas  for  which  proposals  and  funding  did  not  come  together  were:  Central  and
Southern Appalachians, Eastern Midwest, South Atlantic Coast and Caribbean, Southern Great
Plains,  and  Southwest-Rio  Grande,  although  some  additional  joint  study  did  go  on  for  the  last
two  areas.  The  Native  People/Native  Homelands  workshop  led  to  a  proposal  covering  only  the
Southwest.

7 While  much  was  accomplished  in  the  three  regions  that  did  not  ultimately  publish  assess-
ment  reports,  a  shortfall  in  funds  did  prevent  the  publication  of  the  draft  reports  for  the  Cali-
fornia  and  Native  Peoples-Southwest  regions.  The  Northern  Great  Plains  region  carried  out  its
outreach activities via other means than publishing a hard-copy report.

portant  aspects  of  these  issues  would  be  getting  covered  in  the  regional  assess-
ments.

To  provide  the  technical  information  needed  to  underpin  the  regional,  sectoral,
and  national  assessments,  the  USGCRP  agencies  also  funded  initial,  but  quite  lim-
ited,  activities  relating  to  projection  of  climate,  vegetation  cover,  economic  develop-
ment,  and  technology  development.  In  addition,  to  provide  overall  coordination  and
facilitation  among  the  regions,  sectors,  agencies  and  NAST,  the  SGCR  established
the  National  Assessment  Coordination  Office  (NACO).  NACO’s  activities  included
providing  staff  support  to  the  NAST,  organizing  annual  meetings  of  leaders  of  all
the assessment teams, issuing newsletters, maintaining a Web site, and, especially,
understanding and communicating the interests and concerns among the groups and
with  the  agencies  which,  for  legal  and  contractual  reasons,  were  in  a  number  of
cases unable to work directly with the groups they were sponsoring.

While a great deal was accomplished, the most challenging problem was funding.
Fulfilling  the  legal  requirement  for  a  report  to  Congress  and  supporting  such  a
broad  assessment  activity  was  really  an  unfunded  mandate.  There  was  not  time,
and  little  likelihood,  to  move  a  request  for  sufficient  funding  for  each  agency
through  the  OMB  and  Congressional  budget  process,  especially  to  cover  activities
occurring  over  a  number  of  years.  There  was  also  some  question  about  whether  as-
sessment really fits within the definition of research that prevails in some agencies.
To  bypass  the  need  for  coordinated  interagency  funding  approval,  the  assessment
activity  was  subdivided  into  about  30  components  (e.g.,  support  a  regional  assess-
ment, support a sectoral assessment, etc.) and each of the eight active agencies was
asked  to  find  the  resources  to  assume  responsibility  for  the  several  specific  tasks
most closely related to their mission (e.g., USDA supported the agriculture and for-
est sectors, etc.). We ended up getting about 25 of the 30 components funded. A key
issue  for  future  assessments  will  be  addressing  this  problem,  because  the  uneven-
ness  of  the  funding  that  different  agencies  could  and  did  make  available  led  to  un-
evenness,  discontent,  bewilderment,  and  even  jealousy  across  the  participating
groups.

Despite  the  complexity  and  problems  associated  with  the  overall  effort,  a  great
deal  was  accomplished.  The  overall  effort,  which  entailed  planning  workshops,
building  of  stakeholder  interfaces,  regional  and  sectoral  analyses  and  studies,  na-
tional  synthesis,  and,  for  all  reports,  extensive  review,  took  four  years.  There  was
a  significant  level  of  coordination  achieved,  both  through  exchange  of  information
among  teams  at  workshops  and  e-mail,  and  with  some  direction  from  the  NAST.
Most  of  the  reports  (and  a  lot  of  related  publications)  were  completed  and  distrib-
uted  in  1999  and  2000  (regional  reports  by  the  regions;  sectoral  by  the  sectoral
groups;  and  the  national  reports  through  SGCR  and  OSTP).  The  reports  remain
available over the Web at http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc/default.htm, and the
national level reports are also available from Cambridge University Press.

Except for the relatively few regions and sectors where new funding was provided
(e.g., in California, where the findings of the regional assessment raised such inter-
est that the state established its own program), these reports remain today the most
comprehensive set of information about the likely impacts of climate change on the
U.S.  In  addition,  the  National  Assessment  set  of  activities  served  as  the  primary
basis for the summary of impacts that was included in the IPCC’s chapter on North
America in its Third Assessment Report, in the National Academy of Science’s 2001
report  prepared  in  response  to  a  series  of  questions  from  President  Bush,  and  in
the impacts and adaptation chapter of the U.S. Climate Action Report—2002, which,
after  word-by-word  approval  by  all  the  key  government  agencies  and  the  Executive
Office of the President, was submitted in late May 2002 as the official U.S. Govern-
ment communication under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that
the U.S. ratified in 1992. Quite clearly, the National Assessment process from 1997–
2001  served  many  purposes,  from  local  and  regional  to  national  and  international.
Rebuilding a National Assessment Capability

As  mentioned  above,  it  was  envisioned  that  an  integrated  regional-sectoral-na-
tional assessment activity would continue on well beyond 2001, building on progress
spurred  by  the  ongoing  research  program,  interacting  continuously  with  stake-
holders,  and  periodically  issuing  reports  that  represented  snapshots  of  under-
standing  at  that  point.  Instead,  the  Climate  Change  Science  Program,  which  came
to encompass the USGCRP, chose to focus its resources primarily on further reduc-
ing  uncertainties  relating  to  the  science  of  climate  change  rather  than  building  ca-
pabilities for evaluating the implications of climate change for people and the envi-
ronment. There is indeed much research to be done (on climate extremes, on hurri-
canes, on ecosystem responses, and in other areas listed in the CCSP research strat-

egy8 ),  and  I  certainly  support  additional  funds  for  addressing  the  major  scientific
uncertainties,  but  much  is  reasonably  well  understood,  and  I  believe  it  is  particu-
larly  unfortunate  for  the  American  public  (and  also  in  violation  of  the  GCRA90)  to
not  also  be  sponsoring  a  strong  national  assessment  activity.  Unfortunately,  except
for  a  relatively  small  number  of  ongoing  activities,  the  focus  of  which  has  in  some
cases moved away from climate change, most of the regional, sectoral, and national
assessment  capabilities  created  for  the  National  Assessment  have  largely  been  dis-
continued.  As  a  result,  capabilities  will  have  to  be  rebuilt  if  our  nation  is  going  to
have  available  the  information  needed  to  effectively  and  economically  prepare  for
and adapt to the changes that lie ahead. If this is not done, the progress being made
through  the  scientific  research  will  simply  not  be  effectively  communicated  to  and
usable by most stakeholders.

To  rebuild  and  expand  the  national  assessment  capability  so  that  it  is  providing
information across the country of the kind and quality that California is putting to-
gether  to  address  key  climate  impacts  on  its  citizens,  infrastructure,  and  economy,
several steps need to be taken:

1. Call  for  a  national  assessment  capability:  It  needs  to  be  made  explicit
in  H.R.  906  that  the  assessment  process  is  more  than  preparation  of  a  na-
tional-level  report  to  Congress.  Indeed,  it  needs  to  be  stated  that  what  is
needed  is  a  widely  distributed  national  assessment  capability  that  can  ben-
efit  private  and  public  sector  organizations,  local  and  State  governments,
and  the  public  at  large.  As  explained  below,  this  effort  needs  to  have  re-
gional, sectoral, and national components.

2. Ensure a broad scope: GCRA90 and H.R. 906 both properly call for assess-
ments  of  global  change,  not  just  climate  change;  that  is,  in  addition  to  deal-
ing  with  long-term  climate  change,  the  stated  intent  is  to  deal  with  issues
that  include,  for  example,  the  individual  and  coupled  impacts  of  changes  in
stratospheric  ozone,  large-scale  changes  in  atmospheric  chemistry,  ocean
acidification,  deforestation  and  desertification,  shifts  in  species  ranges  and
loss  of  biodiversity,  changes  in  population  and  demand  for  water  and  other
ecosystem services, natural influences such as major volcanic eruptions, and
more.  For  the  first  National  Assessment,  we  used  the  threat  of  ‘‘climate
change’’ as a means to initiate consideration of broader concerns over global
change and sustainability. This was accomplished by having the first discus-
sion  question  inquire  about  other  large-scale,  long-term  issues,  influences,
and  trends  (e.g.,  the  overdrawing  of  underground  aquifers  in  some  regions).
The  second  question  then  inquired  about  how  climate  change  might  exacer-
bate  or  ameliorate  the  consequences  of  the  various  factors  leading  change,
or how it might introduce new stresses or opportunities. The assessment ac-
tivity  needs  to  avoid  considering  climate  change  in  the  absence  of  how  soci-
ety and the environment are otherwise changing; they will only be useful to
real  people  if  done  in  the  context  of  all  types  of  changes  that  are  going  on.
Fully addressing global change and sustainability will likely to require even
broader interagency cooperation and budget coordination than at present.

3. Allow  coupled  consideration  of  mitigation  and  adaptation:  GCRA90
separated  mitigation  from  adaptation,  yet  it  became  clear  during  the  Na-
tional  Assessment  that  they  are  coupled  in  certain  ways.  Changes  in  water
resources  will  affect  the  potential  for  generation  of  biomass;  changes  in  cli-
mate may well affect wind power resources and demand for energy; changes
in  land  cover  for  energy  generation  will  affect  surface  albedo,  dust  loading,
and even air pollution; changes in location of icing could affect transmission
lines;  etc.  Certainly,  the  technology  research  programs  are  best  kept  sepa-
rate,  but  choices  regarding  particularly  renewable  energy  technologies  and
their  implications  need  to  be  considered  jointly  with  issues  of  impacts  and
adaptation.

4. Provide  separate  funding:  Whether  at  NSF  where  research  is  defined  as
something  new  or  at  USDA  where  land-grant  funds  are  allocated  for  other
purposes  and  seemingly  can’t  be  diverted,  borrowing  and  begging  from  the
research  budgets  of  various  agencies  did  not  work  well,  having  to  struggle
to  overcome  long-standing  agency  and  recipient  relationships.  At  the  same
time, putting all of the additional funds in one agency would tend to reduce

8 It  is  not,  of  course,  enough  to  list  the  scientific  question  in  the  plan.  What  has  to  be  done
is to have an effective research program to address the key questions, and this is not happening
across  the  various  elements,  especially  in  aspects  critical  to  identifying  and  evaluating  the  im-
pacts of climate change.

overall credibility, as was the perception when EPA alone was funding early
assessment  activities  in  the  late  1980s.  For  credibility,  multiple  agencies,
each  with  their  particular  interests  and  capabilities,  need  to  share  the  re-
sponsibilities and ownership of the assessment activities.

5. Provide  for  national  baseline  information:  Regional,  sectoral,  and  na-
tional  assessments  will  all  require  developing  a  set  of  scenarios  of  projected
changes  in  climate,  ecosystems,  demographics,  technology,  economics,  and
energy technologies. A problem with the first National Assessment was that
these activities were inadequately supported and got started too late to real-
ly  get  the  information  to  assessment  teams  when  it  was  needed.  Each  of
these  efforts  can  be  started  up  quickly,  perhaps  most  effectively  under  the
oversight  of  national  panels  set  up  under  the  auspices  of  a  relevant  profes-
sional  society  or  foundation.  Major  data  sets  that  are  generated  can  likely
best  be  maintained  and  made  available  through,  for  example,  national  or
agency  laboratories  or  centers.  There  is  also  a  need  for  research  funding  to
develop  the  capability  for  generating  much  more  useful  projections  and  sce-
narios, and to find the means to allow for consideration of societal evolution,
alternative  policies,  etc.  This  will  require  a  coupling  of  the  assessment  and
research  planning  efforts.  The  assessment  component  of  this  effort  is  likely
to require several million dollars per year, especially to support the running
of regional models and the involvement of the social science community.

6. Generalize the time horizon: GCRA90 called for looking 25 and 100 years
ahead. This was too limiting. Many stakeholders want to have projections for
only 10 years in the future, even though scientists would say, and the stake-
holders  understand,  that  natural  variability  and  events  such  as  volcanic
eruptions  could  cause  fluctuations  larger  than  the  expected  changes  over
these short time scales. The reason even limited confidence estimates can be
important  is  that  businesses  are  not  dependent  on  conditions  being  exactly
at the expected mean value; for reasons of competitive edge and to avoid gov-
ernment  regulation  if  failure  happens  too  often,  resource-related  businesses
are typically able to flexibly adapt to conditions that span 90 percent or more
of  the  possible  range  of  monthly  to  seasonal  climatic  variations  (e.g.,  have
enough  capacity  and  reserves  to  be  able  to  ensure  enough  natural  gas  or
heating  oil  for  all  but  the  very  coldest  years,  after  which  they  might  need
to  resort  to  significant  price  increases  or  extra  transport  of  fuel,  or  to  pleas
to  the  public  for  conservation,  or,  in  the  direst  situations,  not  meeting  the
demand). In that many businesses already have developed an adaptive capa-
bility  to  deal  with  a  reasonable  range  of  extremes,  a  projected  trend  in  the
mean  can  be  used  to  plan  how  best  to  plan  for  changes  in  the  likelihood  of
extreme  events  (e.g.,  to  ensure  sufficient  electric  power  during  heat  waves).
For  other  groups,  for  example  those  planning  buildings  or  developing  new
paving materials, information out to 50 years is more important. The assess-
ment activity therefore needs to recognize that different groups are likely to
need  widely  divergent  information,  from  changes  in  the  mean  to  changes  in
the extremes.

7. Insist  on  stakeholder  involvement  and  an  applications-oriented  ef-
fort:  It  really  needs  to  be  made  clear  that  the  national  assessment  activity
is  an  applications-oriented,  mission-directed  part  of  the  overall  USGCRP.
Too  often,  assessments  are  being  done  by  pulling  researchers  away  from
their research. That can be fine for a short time and for scientific review pa-
pers, but that is not how this part of the program should be conducted. The
assessment effort needs to be designed to maintain an ongoing interface with
stakeholders,  and  to  develop  the  tools  and  information  that  stakeholders
need,  taking  account  of  the  special  knowledge  and  situations  that  are  being
analyzed. As such, the activity needs to have a philosophy and operating ap-
proach  that  is  akin  to  NOAA’s  existing  regional  climate  centers.  While  new
information  and  insights  will  and  can  be  generated  by  the  assessment  proc-
ess, this effort needs to be informed by research, but driven by stakeholders.
8. Insist  on  and  support  a  network  of  regional  decision-support  cen-
ters: A wide range of impacts that matter happen where people live. As one
approach  to  estimating  impacts,  it  is  essential  to  have  a  place-based  focus
in  the  assessment  process;  those  who  best  know  and  can  relate  to  a  region
are those who live and do their work there. The National Assessment strug-
gled  a  lot  with  the  question  of  what  a  region  is,  and  ended  up  with  ones  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

22

varying  size  and  rationale.9 The  most  important  considerations  ended  up
being  that  the  regions  included  people  facing  similar  problems  and  that  the
participants  in  the  region  were  able  to  get  together  for  one-day  information,
coordination,  and  outreach  meetings  (getting  stakeholders  to  devote  more
than one day is very difficult, given the long-term nature of the benefit they
can expect). For the first National Assessment activity, keeping in mind that
the  U.S.  is  responsible  for  islands  in  the  Caribbean  and  Pacific,  it  seemed
that 20 regions was about the right number.

For  the  National  Assessment,  the  USGCRP  agencies  were  generally  only
able  to  provide  enough  funding  to  get  a  team  established  that  drew  mem-
bers  from  one  university.  A  number  of  the  regions  were  able  to  reach  out
and  build  broader  teams  by  attracting  separately  supported  participants
from  land  and  sea  grant  programs,  from  government  laboratories,  and  sim-
ply  because  of  the  uniqueness  of  this  first  effort;  on-going  efforts,  however,
are going to require more substantial support for each center (likely of order
$1–2M  per  year  per  region—and  if  regional  modeling  is  involved,  substan-
tially more).

Ideally,  I  believe  that  regional  centers  (or  virtual  centers  or  cooperative
regional  programs)  are  needed  that  draw  on  capabilities  from  multiple  uni-
versities,  laboratories,  stakeholder  organizations,  and  other  expertise  in  a
region,  thereby  creating  a  regionalized  science,  assessment,  and  decision-
support capability. Such centers (or capabilities) need to be able to do more
than  just  review  existing  scientific  literature.  They  need  to  be  able  to  carry
out  and  analyze  the  large-scale  changes  that  characterize  and  drive  global
and  national  change,  and  then  apply  this  large-scale  information  in  local
and  regional  analyses  using  the  available  and  calibrated  local  and  regional
models.

For the assessment and decision-support aspect of the effort, the Regional
Integrated Sciences Assessment (RISA) teams that have been established by
NOAA  in  a  few  regions  provide  an  example  of  what  will  be  needed  (and
about which Dr. Phil Mote will testify).10 The scope of capabilities, however,
will  need  to  be  strengthened  so  that  these  regional  centers  can  address
issues  of  changes  not  only  of  climate,  but  also  for  ecosystems,  water  re-
sources, health, agriculture, demographics, economic development, transpor-
tation, and more. To achieve both breadth and flexibility as the set of issues
change,  it  may  be  best  to  establish  a  virtual  regional  center  rather  than  a
specific  center  at  a  fixed  location  (California  seems  to  have  been  able  to  do
this), or to base administrative coordination efforts at a government labora-
tory  or  major  center  within  the  region,  with  expertise  distributed  across  a
set of universities.

Getting  such  activities  up  and  going  across  the  country  will  take  at  least
a  few  years,  but  really  does  need  to  occur  so  that  all  regions  can  have  the
types of information now available for those few regions that are supported.
Required funding for roughly 20 regional activities likely needs to be rough-
ly $20M per year.

9. Call  for  and  support  sectoral  assessments:  While  many  of  the  impacts
are  regionally  distinctive,  our  nation  is  interconnected  in  many  ways.  The
National  Assessment  sponsored  five  sectoral  assessments,  but  recognized
that many more were needed and hoped that they would be initiated as part
of ongoing activities. There have been a few efforts to do this, with, for exam-
ple,  EPA  continuing  to  sponsor  assessments  of  the  significance  of  climate
change for human health and air and water quality, and DOT for issues re-
lating  to  climate  and  transportation  infrastructure  and  operation.  But  the
CCSP’s  efforts  have  so  far  been  quite  limited,  forcing  the  initiation  of  other
modest  and  generally  underfunded  efforts  (e.g.,  GAO,  at  Congressional  re-
quest, on Public Lands; a few environmental groups for various regions; and

9 We  considered  trying  to  subdivide  the  U.S.  by  watershed,  by  agency  defined  administrative
region,  by  political  boundary,  and  more.  In  the  end,  recalling  the  book  The  Nine  Nations  of
North  America  that  focuses  on  the  common  interests  and  values  of  those  in  particular  areas,
and  even  considering  whether  the  boundaries  of  major  football  conferences  might  help  define
this, we ended up using no single criterion and allowed fuzzy boundaries for regions.

10 The  four  regional  centers  sponsored  by  DOE’s  National  Institute  for  Climatic  Change  Re-
search  (NICCR)  provide  an  example  of  how  regional  research  can  be  focused  and  coordinated
across  several  universities  in  a  given  region,  although  their  core  set  of  activities  is  not  as  fo-
cused as for the RISA centers.

a number of groups on defense and national security implications); fully sup-
ported studies are needed.

Establishing  on-going  panels  that  are  expected  to  regularly  update  their
analyses  and  assessments  would  likely  work  best,  with  a  sustained  capa-
bility  maintained  in  order  to  be  responsive  to  new  questions,  inquiries,  and
research results. The overall objective would be to help those in each sector
have  the  information  they  need  to  cost  effectively  prepare  for  and  adapt  to
ongoing and prospective climatic and environmental change.

In  addition  to  the  areas  for  which  initial  assessments  were  done,  areas
that  are  particularly  worthy  of  study  include  extreme  events  (e.g.,  hurri-
canes), energy, transportation, infrastructure, business and commerce, trade
and international economics, recreation and tourism, wildlife and migrating
species, drylands and deserts, public parks and natural lands, national secu-
rity, international interconnections including environmental refugees, urban
areas, rural communities, and more.

To lead such efforts, partnerships between independent professional or re-
search organizations and government research entities would likely be most
effective,  and  might  be  a  means  that  would  allow  these  teams  to  deal  with
proprietary  information  and  to  develop  recommendations  on  policies  that
could  help  ease  impacts  and  promote  adaptation  in  the  sector  analyzed.
Funding  for  a  set  of  such  activities  should  likely  start  at  a  level  of  about
$5–10M.

10. National  vulnerability  assessment:  The  National  Assessment  Synthesis
Team  (NAST)  was  established  to  provide  high-level  direction  for  and  inte-
gration  across  the  distributed  assessment  activities.  NAST’s  responsibility
included  carrying  out  the  national  synthesis  by  considering  the  larger  pic-
ture,  encouraging  learning  and  interaction  across  the  separate  activities,
and looking for gaps and weaknesses. Having NAST organized as a federal
advisory committee11 created credibility and allowed for openness in its ac-
tivities,  including  in  its  review  process.12 Insisting  that  such  an  inde-
pendent structure be used in the future is important for many reasons, es-
pecially credibility; it is fine to ask for an Administration evaluation of the
resulting  report,  but  the  vulnerability  assessment  should  not  be  a  formal
Administration or interagency document.

It  is  unclear  whether  an  entity  similar  to  NAST  could  be  sustained  on
a  continuing  basis  using  mainly  volunteer  members  who  actually  are  also
responsible for writing the report; quite likely some support will be needed
for  member  support,  for  special  studies,  and  for  support  staff.  Finding  a
way  to  have  NAST’s  members  be  both  widely  representative  of  stake-
holders (including representing the interests of the agencies and Congress)
while  also  having  the  needed  distribution  and  depth  of  expertise  will  be  a
challenge.  Funding  required  is  likely  $2M  per  year,  including  support  for
national level meetings.

11. Overall  Facilitation  and  Coordination:  The  SGCR  established  the  Na-
tional Assessment Coordination Office (NACO) to ensure effective coordina-
tion across all of the various parts of the effort; this involved both a service
and  a  subtle  independent  voice  supporting  the  overall  vision  for  what  is
wanted.  Some  sort  of  similar  function  will  be  needed  for  future  assess-
ments,  including  especially  promoting  coordination,  cooperation,  and  ex-
change of information across the regions, sectors, agencies, and national as-
sessment  team.  For  reasons  of  credibility  and  acceptance,  it  will  be  impor-
tant to find a way to make sure this is done on an interagency basis.

12. Timing:  GCRA90  and  H.R.  906  both  provide  for  an  assessment  every  four
years. While periodic reports can be useful, they can also be very disruptive
to  an  ongoing  assessment  process  if  every  part  of  the  process  must  focus

11 Although NAST operated legally under the auspices of NSF, its functioning, oversight, and
interactions  were  handled  on  an  interagency  basis,  giving  it  broader  independence  and  credi-
bility.  The  independence  also  allowed  each  agency  to  separately  consider  NAST’s  findings  and
integrate  them  into  their  various  roles  and  priorities.  Based  on  experiences  of  trying  to  get  all
agencies  to  approve  every  word  of  official  government  reports,  it  is  important  that  this  not  be
required.

12 Having  a  Federal  Register  review  in  addition  to  an  extensive  expert  review  served,  in  my
view,  a  very  useful  role.  However,  an  open  review  can  also  create  difficulties  because  open  re-
lease  of  a  draft  report  tends  to  draw  more  media  attention  that  release  of  the  final  findings.

on  meeting  the  same  timelines.  For  this  reason,  rather  than  setting  tight
timelines  and  a  common,  coordinated  schedule  for  all  parts  of  the  process
as is done for IPCC assessments,13 NAST understood that, while there was
a need for the various regional and sectoral teams to conduct some common
analyses  for  national  integration,  each  region  and  each  sector  also  needed
some  flexibility  in  undertaking  their  own  studies  for  their  own  audiences.
Thus,  the  national  synthesis  effort  was  set  up  as,  essentially,  a  ‘‘snapshot’’
at a particular time and focused on a particular aspect of global change, ini-
tially  climate  change.  We  envisioned  there  being  future  snapshots  to  catch
up with other aspects of the issue.

For the future, I would think it useful to continue to ask for periodic na-
tional-level  reports—indeed,  that  the  needed  report  called  for  in  the
GCRA90 has not been provided is very unfortunate. While there should not
be an expectation that each report will cover every aspect of global change,
coordination  across  successive  reports  should  be  done  to  ensure  that  Con-
gress  really  does  periodically  have  an  up-to-date  synthesis  of  the  key  na-
tional  issues.  To  accomplish  this,  what  would  be  most  useful,  I  would
think, would be to receive, over time, a series of reports from different per-
spectives  and  taking  different  crosscuts  of  the  issue—one  time  focused  on
climate  change,  another  time  on  ecosystem  services  and  vitality,  another
time  on  water  resources  and  drought,  etc.,  and  then,  in  addition,  having
an integrated executive synthesis. Neither scientific understanding nor cli-
mate  normally  changes  fast  enough  to  justify  generating  a  full  set  of  re-
ports in each region and sector on the same material every four years; how-
ever, an up-to-date synthesis should always be available.

13. Policy  and  technology  evaluation  for  adaptation:  Unlike  GCRA90,
H.R. 906 calls in section 107(5) for the vulnerability assessment to analyze
‘‘the adoption rates of policies and technologies available to reduce the vul-
nerability  of  society  to  global  change. . .’’  This  looks  to  me  to  be  a  useful
new  component  of  a  national-level  assessment.  Such  analyses  should  also
be  useful  as  a  foundation  for  covering  this  subject  in  the  quadrennial  sub-
mission  of  the  U.S.  Climate  Action  Report.  The  National  Assessment  was
not very successful at getting at the issue of adaptation to various impacts;
having  a  special  effort,  at  a  reasonable  funding  level,  would  likely  be  very
helpful.

14. Communication,  education  and  outreach  program:  While  the  Na-
tional  Assessment  planned  a  communication,  education,  and  outreach  com-
ponent,  there  were  inadequate  funds  to  do  very  much.  A  key  problem  was
that  the  agencies  involved  just  did  not  feel  they  were  empowered  to  use
funds  designated  for  research  for  these  purposes,  especially  when  the  re-
search  funding  was  very  tight  and  there  were  many  issues  that  needed  to
be  addressed.  In  some  way,  the  legislation  needs  to  call  for  such  activities
and  find  ways  to  make  sure  that  funding  can  be  provided,  even  if  through
the agency education allocations, etc. Funding should be at $1–2M per year.
15. Policy  assessment:  Section  108  of  H.R.  906  calls  for  a  policy  assessment
that documents current policies across the country for both adaptation and
mitigation,  analyzes  the  effectiveness  of  these  policies,  and  identifies  and
evaluates the need for additional policies. I would suggest that the adapta-
tion component of this assessment not related to the emission or uptake of
greenhouse gases be made part of the national vulnerability assessment so
as  to  make  the  remaining  effort  more  focused  and  manageable.  With  re-
spect  to  the  mitigation  assessment,  to  ensure  credibility,  it  will  be  impor-
tant to have this assessment done by an independent panel organized under
the  auspices  of  a  university,  foundation,  or  research  or  policy  center.  Re-
quired funding is likely a few million per year.

What Can Be Done in a Year?

The fact that we have gone seven years without a full assessment would certainly
seem  a  good  reason  to  ask  that  the  next  assessment  be  completed  in  a  year.  How-
ever,  insisting  on  such  a  rapid  timetable  could  well  lead  to  such  an  inadequate  re-

13 In addition to requiring very tight coordination and essentially the superseding of all other
activities  and  stakeholder  interactions,  scheduling  all  reports  to  finish  simultaneously  also  has
the unfortunate side effect of leading to peaks of attention on the issue every several years rath-
er than promoting ongoing attention to the need to build adaptive capacity.

sult  that  it  would  impair  progress  in  getting  to  the  comprehensive  national  capa-
bility that we need. Much, however, can be done in a year:

A  coordinated,  interagency  effort  to  prepare,  review,  and  publish  a  plan  for  a
comprehensive national assessment;
In  that  historical  and  scenario-based  information  will  be  required  on  climate,
land  cover,  demographics,  technology,  and  economics,  steps  should  be  required
to initiate such efforts;
The existing set of regionally based activities should be expanded;
Key  agencies  should  be  encouraged  to  initiate  sectoral  assessment  activities  on
a number of new topics; and
Agency  budgets  should  be  augmented  to  provide  for  their  participation  in  a
greatly expanded assessment activity.

In  my  view,  establishing  the  national  capability  over  the  next  one  to  two  years
and  then  pushing  for  the  next  national-level  synthesis  within  three  years  would  be
possible  while  assuring  that  useful  information  would  be  starting  to  get  to  stake-
holders relatively quickly.

In  addition,  the  Administration  should  be  called  upon  to  complete  the  seriously
overdue Climate Action Report, with the process including an adequate time for ex-
pert and public review of the draft and Congressional evaluation of the result.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MICHAEL C. MACCRACKEN

Michael MacCracken has been Chief Scientist for Climate Change Programs with
the  Climate  Institute  in  Washington,  D.C.,  since  2002;  he  was  also  elected  to  its
Board  of  Directors  in  2006.  Both  of  these  positions  are  held  on  a  volunteer  basis.
Dr.  MacCracken  received  his  B.S.  in  Engineering  degree  from  Princeton  Univer-
sity  in  1964  and  his  Ph.D.  degree  in  Applied  Science  from  the  University  of  Cali-
fornia Davis/Livermore in 1968. His dissertation used a 2–D climate model to evalu-
ate  the  plausibility  of  several  hypotheses  of  the  causes  of  ice  ages.  Following  his
graduate  work,  he  joined  the  Physics  Department  of  the  University  of  California’s
Lawrence  Livermore  National  Laboratory  (LLNL)  as  an  atmospheric  physicist.  His
research  in  the  ensuing  25  years  included  numerical  modeling  of  various  causes  of
climate change (including study of the potential climatic effects of greenhouse gases,
volcanic  aerosols,  land-cover  change,  and  nuclear  war)  and  of  factors  affecting  air
quality  (including  photochemical  pollution  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area  and  sul-
fate  air  pollution  in  the  northeastern  United  States).  At  LLNL,  he  also  served  as
deputy division leader for atmospheric and geophysical sciences from 1974–1987 and
then division leader from 1987–1993.

From 1993–2002, Dr. MacCracken was on assignment as senior global change sci-
entist  to  the  interagency  Office  of  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program
(USGCRP)  in  Washington,  D.C.,  also  serving  as  its  first  Executive  Director  from
1993–1997. From 1997–2001, he served as Executive Director of the USGCRP’s Na-
tional Assessment Coordination Office, which facilitated and coordinated the efforts
of  20  regional  assessment  teams,  five  sectoral  teams,  and  the  National  Assessment
Synthesis  Team  (which  was  constituted  as  a  federal  advisory  committee)  that  pre-
pared  the  national  climate  impact  assessment  report  that  was  forwarded  to  the
President and on to Congress in late 2000. During this period with the Office of the
USGCRP,  Dr.  MacCracken  also  was  a  co-author/contributing  author  for  various
chapters  in  the  IPCC  assessment  reports  and  helped  coordinate  the  official  U.S.
Government reviews of the second and third assessment reports of the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change.

When Dr. MacCracken’s assignment with the Office of the USGCRP concluded on
September 30, 2002, he simultaneously retired from LLNL. In addition to his activi-
ties with the Climate Institute, he served on the integration team for the Arctic Cli-
mate  Impact  Assessment  from  2002–2004.  Dr.  MacCracken  is  also  near  completing
a four-year term (2003–2007) as president of the International Association of Mete-
orology  and  Atmospheric  Sciences  (IAMAS),  members  of  which  are  the  national
academies of science or their equivalent in about 50 nations. As president of IAMAS,
Dr.  MacCracken  also  serves  on  the  executive  committees  of  International  Union  of
Geodesy  and  Geophysics  (IUGG)  and  of  the  Scientific  Committee  for  Oceanic  Re-
search (SCOR). From 2004 to 2005, he served on a panel of the Scientific Committee
on  Problems  in  the  Environment  that  prepared  a  report  on  what  is  known  about
the likelihood and consequences of an asteroid or comet impact, and from 2004–2007
on  a  scientific  expert  group  convened  by  Sigma  Xi  and  the  UN  Foundation  at  the
request  of  the  UN’s  Commission  on  Sustainable  Development  to  suggest  the  best

measures  for  mitigating  and  adapting  to  global  climate  change  (report  available  at
http://www.confrontingclimatechange.org).

Dr.  MacCracken  is  a  fellow  of  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of
Science (AAAS) and a member of the American Meteorological Society, the Oceanog-
raphy  Society,  and  the  American  Geophysical  Union,  among  other  organizations.
His  affidavit  relating  global  climate  change  and  impacts  on  particular  regions  was
recently  cited  favorably  by  Justice  Stevens  in  his  opinion  in  the  recent  decision  in
Massachusetts et al. versus EPA.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Dr.  MacCracken.  Dr.  Fellows,  please.

STATEMENT OF DR. JACK D. FELLOWS, VICE PRESIDENT,

UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH

Dr. FELLOWS. Thank you, Madam Chairman, Chairwoman.
I  would  like  to  thank  the  Subcommittee  for  the  opportunity  to
testify  on  H.R.  906,  in  addition  to  my  personal  involvement  in  the
creation of the U.S. Global Change Research Program. And I want-
ed  to  mention  that  UCAR,  this  consortium  of  70  universities,  has
been involved in this program for over 15 years as well.

The  Subcommittee  asked  me  to  address  the  following  questions:
What  are  the  major  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  U.S.  Global
Change Research Program? Are the current program funding levels
adequate for adaptation and mitigation research and characterizing
national  vulnerability  to  climate  change?  And  how  can  we  ensure
that  resource  managers  and  policy-makers’  needs  are  met  by  the
program?

Let  me  start  by  describing  the  current  U.S.  Global  Change  Re-
search  Program  strengths.  The  program  has  always  been  focused
on  producing  the  sound,  scientific  basis  for  policy-making.  It  has
developed a unique interagency mechanism that provides a critical
mass  and  focus  for  planning,  and  it  is  periodically  peer  reviewed.
It has also made an effort to tie research and observational strate-
gies to user needs, and it has clearly advanced the science over the
last 17 years.

Although  it  is  not  perfect—it  does  have  some  weakness—it  has
been  impacted  by  political  influences  over  the  years,  climate  poli-
tics,  overshadowed  by  other  priorities.  Over  its  history,  its  leaders
have  not  always  been  given  the  support  and  tools  to  make  the
tough  decisions  and  tradeoffs  between  program  and  agency  prior-
ities. It has been difficult at times to track the progress of the pro-
gram, and it could clearly be more responsive to user needs.

Let me turn to whether or not the program has adequate funding
for  adaptation  and  mitigation  and  characterizing  national  vulner-
ability.  To  discuss  the  budget,  I  will  be  referring  to  the  Financial
Year  ’07  ‘‘Our  Changing  Planet’’  document.  It  is  a  report  that  is
produced  by  the  program  every  year.  That  report  covers  the  years
Financial  Year  ’05  to  ’07.  During  these  years,  the  funding  was
roughly  at  about  $2  billion  a  year.  This  is  not  easy  to  do  a  critical
analysis  of  balance.  Typically,  National  Research  Council  takes  a
couple years to do this.

But the program does have five goals, and the first three are fo-
cused largely on scientific advancement, and the last two on adap-
tation,  mitigation,  and  vulnerability  analysis.  Those  last  two  goals
represent  about  25  to  30  percent  of  the  current  budget,  and  that
is about $300 million annually.

So,  in  my  own  judgment,  I  think  that  the  balance  is  probably
roughly right, and it actually includes a range of synthesis and as-
sessment products that focus on national vulnerability, all the way
from  urban  environments  that  we  live  in  to  even  Arctic  ice,  and
Mr. Inglis, I know you have traveled to the Antarctic, and you have
experienced those ice conditions.

One  balance  issue  that  I  would  like  to  point  out  is  between  Fi-
nancial  Year  ’05  and  ’07,  the  observational  support  actually  de-
creased by almost 30 percent, from $500 million to about $700 mil-
lion.  These  were  largely  NASA  science  cuts  due  to  other  Adminis-
tration  priorities  that  have  weakened  the  program,  right  at  the
time  when  we  really  need  this  kind  of  environmental  observation.
This  reduction  was  actually  highlighted  in  a  recent  National  Re-
search Council report that warned that our national environmental
observation systems are at risk.

Let me turn to whether or not we can ensure that resource man-
agers and policy-makers’ needs are being met in this program. The
program  has  actually  had  a  long  history  of  engaging  stakeholders.
The  program  sponsored,  in  2001,  a  National  Assessment,  of  which
researchers and stakeholders worked together, in 20 regions of the
United  States,  to  help  identify  user  needs.  Most  of  the  synthesis
and  assessment  products  that  came  out  of  this  effort  continued  to
be  an  important  part  of  the  program,  and  involved  the  stake-
holders.

But  despite  all  these  efforts,  I  do  think  that  H.R.  906  would  in-
crease  user  input,  and  particularly,  on  the  planning  and  priority
setting of the program. So, in summary, I would say that H.R. 906
is  very  timely.  It  is  an  important  piece  of  legislation.  We  have
learned  a  lot  since  1990  on  how  to  run  an  interagency  program,
and the demand for this information is clearly increasing.

If  there  is  anything  I  would  recommend  about  H.R.  906,  it  has
to  do  with  improving  the  interagency  process  itself.  The  bill  does
need  to  further  highlight  the  priority  of  this  program,  so  that  it
doesn’t get diluted by other things. It is still a surprise to me that
there  is  no  aspect  of  this  program  included  in  the  American  Com-
petitive  Initiative,  even  though  most  of  our  economy  is  weather-
sensitive or climate-sensitive.

The bill also ought to identify, I think, a Director of this program
and an Office of this program, and give them the tools and support
and clout to be able to make the tough decisions, in terms of devel-
oping priorities.

So, with that, I will conclude my remarks, Madam Chairwoman,

and I would be happy to answer questions when we get to it.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JACK D. FELLOWS

Introduction

My  name  is  Dr.  Jack  D.  Fellows  and  I  submit  this  written  testimony  for  the
record of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment. I am the Vice Presi-
dent  of  Corporate  Affairs  at  the  University  Corporation  for  Atmospheric  Research
(UCAR)  in  Boulder,  Colorado.  UCAR  is  a  70-university  member  consortium  that
manages and operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research and additional
programs that support and extend the country’s scientific and education capabilities
related to weather and climate. The UCAR community has been a major contributor
to  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  (USGCRP)  for  more  than  15  years.

In  the  invitation  extended  to  me  to  participate  in  today’s  hearing  on  H.R.  906,
the Global Change Research and Data Management Act of 2007, I was asked to ad-
dress the following questions:

1. What  are  the  major  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  current  U.S.  Global

Change Research Program?

2. Are  the  current  levels  of  funding  for  research  to  support  the  development  of
adaptation  practices,  characterization  of  ecosystem,  community,  and  eco-
nomic vulnerability, and mitigation strategies adequate?

3. How  can  we  best  ensure  that  information  needs  of  resources  managers  and
policy-makers at the State and local level are met by the U.S. Global Change
Research Program?

In  addition  to  addressing  these  three  questions,  I  will  also  include  my  comments
on how H.R. 906 can contribute to these three areas. My testimony today expresses
my  own  views  on  H.R.  906  and  is  based  on  my  own  experiences  and  involvement
in the USGCRP since its inception. I was a co-author of the very first USGCRP ‘‘Our
Changing  Planet’’  (OCP)  report  that  accompanied  the  President’s  1990  Budget  and
from  my  vantage  point  at  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  at  that
time,  I  assisted  the  Congress  in  its  enactment  of  the  Global  Change  Research  Act
of 1990 (P.L. 101–606), which codified the USGCRP into law.

While the USGCRP formally started in 1989, it actually began in early 1987 with
some  informal  budget  crosscuts  when  I  was  at  the  OMB.  Those  early  crosscuts
showed  that  over  $1  billion  of  agency  programs  were  related  to  global  change  type
research.  Shortly  after  these  crosscuts,  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  and
OMB lead an interagency effort to improve the coordination of these programs. For
over  15  years,  the  OCP  reports  have  annually  summarized  the  efforts  of  this  criti-
cally  important  interagency  research  effort  to  better  understand  both  the  natural
and  human-induced  changes  occurring  on  our  planet.  The  USGCRP  has  changed
over the years both in research focus and structure. In 2001, the Bush Administra-
tion created the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) that became the umbrella
program  for  both  the  USGCRP  and  the  Bush  Administration’s  Climate  Change  Re-
search  Initiative.  In  July  2003,  the  Bush  Administration  released  the  ‘‘Strategic
Plan  for  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program’’  to  guide  the  CCSP  program.
I  will  be  using  the  FY07  OCP  report  for  the  basis  of  my  testimony  today.  The
USGCRP  does  not  change  radically  from  year  to  year  and  the  FY07  OCP  report  is
a  particularly  relevant  report  to  address  the  three  questions  I  have  been  asked  to
address.

USGCRP Major Strengths and Weaknesses?

My own view is that the USGCRP has been instrumental in improving our knowl-
edge  of  how  our  planet  works  and  how  human  activities  impact  it.  That  said,  I  be-
lieve  the  program  does  have  exceptional  strengths  and  a  few  things  that  must  be
addressed to realize the goals outlined in H.R. 906.

The major strengths of the USGCRP include:

1. Its primary goal has not changed since its inception—to provide a sound sci-
entific basis for developing national and international policy on global change
issues.

2. It has provided an important interagency mechanism for developing research

priorities and budgets and coordinating the program’s implementation.

3. It has provided a ‘‘critical mass’’ and ‘‘focal point’’ both within the federal and
academic  research  and  policy  communities  to  ensure  this  important  science
is discussed, debated, reported, and remain a national priority.

4. It  has  periodically  been  independently  reviewed  (e.g.,  the  National  Academy

of Sciences) and been responsive to those reviews.

5. It  has  tried  to  tie  these  interagency  research  efforts  to  societal  and  user

needs.

The major weaknesses of the USGCRP include:

1. The  program  has  been  subject  to  rather  substantial  political  influences  over
the  years  (e.g.,  avoidance  of  certain  research  areas,  overshadowed  by  other
Administration priorities, disjointed congressional oversight, etc).

2. The interagency process has not always had the leadership and clout to real-
ly  ensure  that  the  highest  research  priorities  are  addressed  or  all  agency
contributions were included (program priorities versus agency priorities).

3. It has not been as responsive to user needs as it could have been.
4. There  has  been  difficulty  in  tracking  budget  categories  and  progress  over
time  as  cited  in  the  2006  GAO  report  entitled  ‘‘Climate  Change:  Greater
Clarity  And  Consistency  Are  Needed  in  Reporting  Federal  Climate  Change
Funding.’’

Are  Current  Funding  Levels  Adequate  to  Support  Adaptation  and  Mitiga-
tion  Research  and  Characterize  Ecosystem,  Community,  and  Eco-
nomic Vulnerability?

In FY07, the USGCRP had five key goal areas (see box). While some of the word-
ing has changed over the years, these goals have been surprisingly stable for many
years.  That  said,  U.S.  climate  research  has  historically  been  focused  on  Goals  1–3,
which have emphasized improvements in fundamental understanding of the climate
systems,  its  driving  forces,  and  the  tools  to  make  predictions  about  climate  varia-
bility and change. As the science has improved and its applicability to societal needs
has  become  more  evident,  the  importance  of  Goals  4–5  have  clearly  increased.  The
FY07  report  has  pages  and  pages  of  highlights  of  progress  in  all  these  goal  areas.
Between, FY05–07, the USGCRP funding has been between $1.7–1.8B. It is difficult
to  critically  assess  the  specific  program  balance  of  such  a  large  program.  National
Academy  of  Science  panels  have  spent  over  a  year  doing  this  kind  of  analysis  and
even  those  reviews  are  largely  done  a  high-level.  That  said,  the  CCSP  Goals  and
Funding Percentage box above shows that the funding for Goals 4–5 are roughly 25–
30 percent of the overall research funding (not including observations). I believe this
is substantially up from the early years of the program, represents a reasonable bal-
ance in the program, and I expect will increase with time given policy and user de-
mand  for  this  type  of  research  and  information.  It  has  just  been  in  the  last  five
years  or  so  that  the  science  has  mature  enough  and  the  Goal  4–5  capacity  capable
enough  to  undertake  the  over  $300  million  annually  being  invested  in  the  Goal  4–
5  areas  today.  The  USGCRP  currently  has  21  Synthesis  and  Assessment  Products
that  are  clearly  applicable  to  national  vulnerability,  including  weather  and  climate
extremes, abrupt climate change, coastal sensitivity to sea level rise, ecosystem dis-
continuities,  global  change  effects  on  agriculture,  water  resource,  and  energy  pro-
duction, human health impacts, best-practice in characterizing uncertainty, decision
support  systems  for  selected  economic  sectors  and  regions,  adaptive  management
strategies, and many others.

One  issue  I  wish  to  point  out  is  the  USGCRP  observations  budget  has  dropped
from  over  $772  million  in  FY05  to  roughly  $575  million  in  FY07  (a  33  percent  de-
crease).  This  is  largely  due  to  substantial  reductions  in  NASA’s  science  budget  and
a problem highlighted in the recent National Research Council’s ‘‘Earth Science and
Application  from  Space:  National  Imperatives  for  the  Next  Decade  and  Beyond.’’
This  is  an  example  where  other  Administration  priorities  have  weakened  the
USGCRP  program  and  interagency  process.  We  should  consider  very  carefully
whether  it  is  in  our  best  interest  to  allow  our  observational  capabilities  to  decline.
I  believe  that  in  the  very  near  future,  policy-makers  will  begin  to  take  actions  to
address  the  climate  change  issues  documented  in  recent  international  reports.  It
would  seem  to  me  that  observing  capabilities  will  be  even  more  important  in  the
future as tools for policy-makers so that they can assess the impact of the important
policy choices they make in response to climate change—which is why it is so hard
to understand why this Administration has allowed such a steep decline in the fund-
ing  of  our  observing  capabilities.  It  is  quite  possible  that  some  of  the  stakeholders
input required in H.R. 906 would also agree with the need to maintain these obser-
vational capabilities.
How can we best ensure that information needs of resources managers and
policy-makers at the State and local level are met by the USGCRP?
In 2001, the USGCRP sponsored the first U.S. National Assessment entitled ‘‘Cli-
mate  Change  Impacts  on  the  United  States:  the  potential  consequences  of  climate
variability  and  change.’’  This  assessment  was  required  by  the  Global  Change  Re-
search  Act  of  1990  and  involved  teams  of  researchers  and  stakeholders  working  in
20  regions  across  the  U.S.  Much  was  learned  from  this  first  assessment  in  terms
of national vulnerability, stakeholder needs, and how to best do assessments in the
future. Many of the FY07 Synthesis and Assessment Products are outgrowths of this
assessment  and  continue  to  solicit  resource  manager  and  policy-maker  needs  at  all
levels.  So,  the  USGCRP  continues  to  make  substantial  progress  in  making  its  in-
vestment relevant to stakeholders. But, is it enough given the urgency and political
interest in this important science and policy issue? I’ll try to address this in the next
section  of  my  testimony.  I  do  believe  that  the  type  of  reports  and  oversight  rec-
ommended  in  H.R.  906  will  go  a  long  way  to  ensuring  that  resource  managers  and
policy-makers needs are met by the USGCRP.
How H.R. 906 can help in these three areas?

Overall  I  believe  that  H.R.  906  is  a  timely  and  important  piece  of  legislation.  We
have  learned  a  lot  about  climate  science  since  1990.  Given  increased  awareness  of
the risks posed by climate change there is significant demand for data, information,
models, and tools to help decision-makers and resources managers cope with climate
change. Thus, the USGCRP has an unprecedented opportunity to provide even more
‘‘decision  support’’  to  stakeholders.  Also,  we  have  grown  wiser  on  how  to  run  inter-
agency  science  programs  over  the  past  17  years.  Given  this  increased  demand  for
information and improved management approaches, I believe it is the right time to
consider replacing the 1990 Act with H.R. 906. The type of program outlined in H.R.
906 is a significant step in the right direction for the following reasons:

1. It  builds  on  the  existing  USGCRP  strengths  and  minimizes  or  even  elimi-

nates the weaknesses mentioned above;

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

2. It  seeks  more  ‘‘balance’’  between  the  physical  and  mitigation/adaptation  re-

search components; and

3. It promotes further stakeholders engagement at all levels.

Many of the bill’s provisions are fully consistent with the recommendations in the
2004  National  Research  Council  report  entitled:  ‘‘Implementing  Climate  and  Global
Change  Research:  A  review  of  the  final  U.S.  Climate  Change  Program  Strategic
Plan.’’  The  only  suggestions  I  have  that  might  further  strengthen  the  bill  include:
1. Leadership,  Priorities,  and  Management.  Given  the  possible  dire  con-
sequences  of  climate  change,  I  find  it  puzzling  that  there  is  no  mention  of
weather  and  climate  in  federal  priorities  like  the  American  Competitiveness
Initiative.  A  significant  portion  of  our  nation’s  economy  is  impacted  by
weather and climate and this area of research and education is preparing the
next generation of environmental leaders that will contribute to both our na-
tion’s safety and to our economy. For the USGCRP leaders to make progress,
this program must be recognized as a key priority in both the Administration
and Congress. Without this level of recognition, the USGCRP leaders will not
have  the  clout  to  make  sure  the  program  stays  focused  on  the  highest  re-
search  and  policy  priorities.  This  bill  would  be  even  stronger  if  it  required
the USGCRP interagency committee to have: (1) a clear budget process link-
ing tasks to agency and program budgets, (2) a USGCRP Director with suffi-
cient  authority  to  ensure  that  agency  programs  reflect  USGCRP  priorities
and  make  tough  tradeoffs  among  competing  agencies  desires  and  evolving
program  needs,  (3)  a  timeline  with  clear  and  realistic  deliverables,  and  (4)
a Director that is clearly held accountable to deliver on the program’s goals.
This would make for an effective interagency enterprise and reflect what we
have  learned  about  interagency  efforts  over  the  past  17  years.  The  flip  side
of  this  is  to  not  make  it  so  rigid  and  centralized  that  it  will  actually  under-
mine  the  interagency  process—always  a  danger!  One  the  greatest  frustra-
tions and challenges in putting together an integrated USGCRP while I was
at  OMB  was  that  there  is  no  equivalent  integrated  oversight  mechanism  in
the Congress. Many people spent enormous amounts of time in the Executive
Branch  putting  this  together  and  then  having  it  looked  at  in  a  completely
non-integrated  manner  on  the  Hill.  Today,  the  restructuring  of  the  com-
mittee  jurisdictions  has  improved  the  integrated  oversight  of  the  USGCRP,
but this is something to keep a watchful eye on.

2. Reporting.  Within  one  year  of  the  Act’s  enactment,  the  Program  must
produce:  (1)  a  10  year  research  plan  that  reflects  user  needs  at  the  federal,
State, regional, and local levels, international coordination recommendations,
categorize user need information needed to develop policies to reduce societal
vulnerability to global change, and identify needed global observations; (2) a
vulnerability  assessment  for  the  U.S.  and  the  world  that  goes  well  beyond
research; and (3) a policy assessment that documents the mitigation and ad-
aptation  policies  being  used  at  the  federal,  State,  and  local  levels,  evaluate
them, and recommended others, (4) a data management plan, and (5) an an-
nual  report.  This  level  of  analysis  and  reporting  is  likely  to  be  very  chal-
lenging within one year and would probably benefit from a different sequenc-
ing. The research plan would be greatly enhanced from the vulnerability and
policy  assessment.  Perhaps  the  research  plan  due  date  should  be  delayed  to
take  advantage  of  a  combined  vulnerability/policy  assessment  that  involves
both the research plan participants and people of very different perspectives
and skills (e.g., economists, policy researchers, etc). There is a much greater
chance that the research plan’s goals and priorities will be responsive to user
needs with this input.

3. Research  and  User-Need  Balance.  This  bill  should  help  refocus  the
USGCRP to better reflect user needs. That said, it shouldn’t eliminate impor-
tant basic research that could lead to a major scientific breakthrough due to
over  emphasis  on  user-driven  requirements.  Whether  this  happens  or  not
will  likely  be  due  to  individual  interpretation  of  the  bill.  While  loosely  im-
plied,  this  kind  of  balance  is  not  directly  addressed  in  the  bill  and  should
be.  Another  way  to  look  at  this  is  that  there  should  be  balance  between  re-
searcher-driven  research  that  may  lead  to  unforeseen  breakthroughs  and  a
more top-down approach to managing programs and setting priorities.

4. Other. Unlike Title 1, there is no reference to user needs in the Title II data
management  section.  It  would  make  sense  that  many  of  these  data  be  rel-
evant  to  user  needs.  Lastly,  Title  I  Page  5  Lines  22–23  should  include  the

obvious agencies involved in the Program just like the data management sec-
tion (Title II Page 18 Lines 9–19).

I  want  to  thank  the  Subcommittee  for  the  chance  to  provide  this  testimony  and
your stewardship of the Nation’s weather and climate enterprise. There will be tre-
mendous  opportunities  in  the  future  for  international  climate  leadership  and  for  a
broad  range  of  research  and  technology  opportunities  that  will  have  substantial  re-
turn  to  our  nation’s  economy.  The  future  strength  of  our  nation  depends  on  today’s
investments in these programs.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JACK D. FELLOWS

Education

Ph.D  (1984),  M.S.  (1976),  B.S.  (1975)  Civil  Engineering,  University  of  Maryland.

Focus: hydrology, geographical information systems, and remote sensing.

Dr.  Fellows  began  his  career  as  a  research  faculty  member  at  the  University  of
Maryland,  where  he  conducted  research  in  the  use  of  satellite  data  in  hydrologic
models. In 1984, he spent a year in the U.S. Congress as the American Geophysical
Union’s Congressional Science Fellow. While in Congress, he split his time between
the personal office of George Brown (D–CA) and the House Science and Space Sub-
committee (George Brown was the Chair at the time) and worked on a range of pol-
icy issues, including water resources, satellite remote sensing, and general oversight
of  federal  research  and  development  funding.  He  helped  write  legislation  that  was
enacted regarding the commercialization of land remote sensing satellites. After this
fellowship  (and  largely  because  of  it),  he  spent  13  years  in  the  Executive  Office  of
President’s  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  overseeing  budget  and  policy
issues  related  to  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration,  the  National
Science  Foundation,  and  federal-wide  research  and  development  programs.  During
this period with OMB, he helped initiate the U.S. Global Change Research Program.
Jack  has  two  roles  at  UCAR.  Since  1997,  Jack  has  been  the  Vice  President  of
UCAR’s Corporate Affairs; he’s responsible for a broad range of corporate activities,
including  development  of  corporate  policies  and  programs,  liaison  with  the  Federal
Government,  management  of  UCAR’s  consortium  of  over  100  national  and  inter-
national  universities,  and  UCAR  (http://www.ucar.edu)  funding  raising,  advocacy,
and  communications  activities.  UCAR  is  a  $200M+  per  year  corporation  with  over
1,300 employees.

He  is  also  the  Director  of  UCAR’s  Office  of  Programs,  responsible  for  overseeing
a broad range of scientific and educational programs that serve the atmospheric and
related  research  and  education  community,  including  building  digital  libraries
(DLESE and NSDL), providing real time data to over 160 universities via the Inter-
net (Unidata), training our nation’s operational forecasters via distance learning and
other  media  (COMET),  and  building  a  multi-national  constellation  of  six  micro-sat-
ellites  to  measure  critical  weather,  climate,  and  space  weather  parameters  (COS-
MIC),  helping  children  around  the  world  learn  how  to  take  and  analyze  environ-
mental  measurement  (GLOBE),  providing  administrative  and  research  services  to
the  atmospheric  science  community  (JOSS).  These  are  all  research,  education,  or
technology programs that the research and education community have asked UCAR
to  manage  based  on  its  excellent  management  background  and  capability.  UOP  is
$40M per year organization with over 400 employees.

Jack  Fellows  was  awarded  the  Edward  A.  Flinn  III  Award  in  1997.  The  Flinn
Award  is  given  to  those  individuals  who  personify  the  Union’s  motto  ‘‘unselfish  co-
operation in research’’ through their facilitating, coordinating, and implementing ac-
tivities.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Dr. Fellows. Dr. Mahoney, please.

Committee, too.

I  am  delighted  to  have  the  chance  to  address  you  today,  and  I
am  a  more  recent  veteran  of  these  skirmishes,  having  spent  four
years in trying to make the interagency process work to a sensible
outcome,  so  I  associate  myself  very  much  with  the  comments  that
Dr.  MacCracken  made  before,  as  well  as  those  of  Dr.  Fellows  just
before me now.

I will mention one of them here again just as a highlight, so that
it  won’t  be  necessary  for  me  to  turn  to  it  in  my  own  comments
quite  as  much,  and  that  is  I  also  bring  the  message  that  I  would
urge  the  Committee,  and  at  the  end  of  the  day,  the  Congress,  to
make  a  more  explicit  position  about  how  this  program  should  be
managed.  On  one  hand,  that  is,  after  all,  a  function  of  the  execu-
tive branch. But it isn’t a function of the executive branch only, to
say  that  to  be  successful,  a  program  like  this  must  have  a  reason-
ably  funded  management  and  coordination  office,  with  a  sense  of
permanence  to  it,  and  that  the  budget  lines  brought  forward
through OMB, and ultimately, those that survive in the President’s
budget  up  here  to  the  Hill,  have  to  recognize  this  kind  of  program
very directly.

One of the key weaknesses that I certainly observe in all the re-
cent  years  is  that  there  has  been  no  move  away  from  the  concept
that  this  is  a  program  conducted  in  13  parts  by,  now,  13  collabo-
rating agencies, and with that view, they all must take—they must
set  their  own  priorities,  and  take  them  internally,  and  then  up  to
OMB, and that leaves no place to really solidify the view about the
priorities for the whole program.

So, if I were to give any one message to this committee, even rec-
ognizing  the  separation  of  powers,  so  that  I  wouldn’t  propose  that
the  Congress  ought  to  explicitly  lay  out  chapter  and  verse  of  orga-
nization  and  management,  but  I  think  some  guidance  being  given
by  the  Congress  would  be  very  helpful,  because  it  is  a  long-term
battle,  and  it  pained  me  a  great  deal  to  see  the  lack  of  progress
that  was  made  in  a  number  of  areas,  because  it  wasn’t  possible  to
break through some of these problems along the way.

With  that,  let  me  press  on  to  the  rest  of  my  comments  very
quickly here as well. Since the Chair already introduced us, I won’t
take  any  more  time  on  that,  and  I  will  pass  directly  to  the  point
that  I  have  a  series  of  comments,  that  I  divide  into  three  parts.
One is some overall comments. The second is a set of comments on
structure  and  resources  for  the  program,  and  then,  the  third  is
some  other  suggestions,  as  well.  In  my  overall  comments,  the  first
is perhaps the most important.

I certainly agree that the Global Change Research Act of 1990 is
ready for a significant update, and I certainly agree with the sense
of  the  current  draft  bill,  focusing  on  much  more  user  interaction,
much more assessment work and the like as part of that, so I sim-
ply applaud those efforts as, to my best lights, as being very much
in place.

Second  point,  an  overview,  though,  I  want  to  raise  the  very  im-
portant  caution  that  we  need  to  be  careful  that  we  don’t  just  flip
from one extreme to the other, in other words, that we don’t deem-
phasize  the  science,  to  the  point,  by  saying  that  what  we  need  to

35

do  is  assessment  and  user  interaction,  which  we  must  do,  but  if
that  all  simply  came  at  the  expense  of  the  underlying  science,  I
would  assert  strongly  that  what  we  know  now,  yes,  the  question
about  human  causation  of  global  change  is  settled,  but  there  are
so many other very important science questions about regional im-
pacts,  abrupt  climate  change,  and  we  could  go  on  and  make  a  list
that  would  consume  all  the  time  here.  So,  what  I  would  suggest
that  what  the,  hopefully  the  Congress,  this  committee  first,  and
then,  ultimately,  the  Congress  would  deal  with  in  this,  is  some-
thing  that  recognizes  the  great  need  to  pick  up  the  user  involve-
ment,  and  get  going  on  that  kind  of  assessment  work,  but  to  mate
that  with  this  continuing  strong  commitment  to  the  underlying
science.

And then I, also, as an overview comment, cite back some of the
areas where I see the benefit of the things the Committee, that this
bill,  the  current  train  has  brought  along,  the  requirements  for
stakeholder  involvement,  the  major  emphasis  on  improved  data
management,  and  a  clear  mandate  for  developing  policy  analysis
statements  as  a  basis  for  understanding  our  climate  information.
I would cite, somewhat in hindsight, that one of the reasons that
the  Climate  Change  Science  Program  was  not  able  to  address  as
much  as  it  might  have  wanted  of  some  of  the  underlying  scientific
information use questions was that there was no framework to put
that against in terms of either one or more, or a set of policies that
are  worth  examining.  So,  treating  those  things  are  a  very  good
point.

Now,  I  will  very  quickly  go  to  a  close.  I  have  got  a  comment  on
structures  and  resources.  First  of  all,  there  is  no  specific  funding
mechanism,  neither  authorization,  nor  other  guidance  about  ap-
proaches to funding in the bill, and I would commend that to your
attention,  given  the  great  difficulty  of  making  a  long-term  multi-
agency  program  run.  There  continues  to  be  a  great  need  to  assure
the independence of the science. I think that is there in large part
with  the  call  for  continued  involvement  with  the  National  Acad-
emy. The Academy’s involvement with the current program is now
well in place under contract, and presumably, this bill will do noth-
ing to take that out of place.

I  look  to  see  major  OMB  involvement  in  this  activity,  because  it
can’t  simply  look  at  the  pieces  and  the  various  lines,  but  it  has  to
look at the program altogether, and as my colleagues have already
commented,  too,  there  is  a  clear  need  for  the  bill  to  say  something
directly  about  the  importance  of  a  coordination  office,  and  its  loca-
tion in government, and its funding.

And  then,  just  the  last  closing  comments.  I  believe  some  of  the
timelines  now  set  out  in  the  bill,  and  the  first  year,  in  particular,
are  unrealistic.  There  is  a  call  for  five  different  reports  to  be  done
in the first year, and there is just no way. I would bet a dime and
make $0.20 on my bet, that that would not happen in one year. So,
I would suggest that you might want to take another look at phas-
ing those somewhat.

Second,  there  is  a  need  to  call  for  a  solid  communication  and
education  strategy  in  the  bill,  too,  since  this  deals  so  much  with
user involvement with the information, yet there is still no call for
that kind of communication capability, and that was absolutely the

36

poor orphan of everything we tried to do in recent years, so I would
hate to see that get left off without any kind of mandate in the law,
when this is done.

And finally, there is a need to coordinate the reports and output
from  this  program  with  the  international  activities  and  other  U.S.
Government reporting activities in the climate area, too. Simply to
say,  as  my  very  last  point,  since  the  IPCC,  for  example,  which  is
just  releasing  its  Fourth  Assessment,  and  which  will  start  a  six-
year  process  toward  its  Fifth  Assessment,  it  would  be  helpful  for
the bill to recognize something that would alternate phase between
the  international  assessments  and  the  major  reporting  responsibil-
ities  in  the  states,  because  many  of  the  same  group  of  scientists,
hundreds  of  U.S.  scientists  are  involved  in  both  of  those  activities.
Many of them are the same people, and the quality is better if the
pain is stretched out a little bit.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES R. MAHONEY

Chairman  Giffords,  Ranking  Member  Inglis  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee:
thank  you  for  your  invitation  to  address  the  subcommittee  today  on  the  important
issue of ‘‘Reorienting the U.S. Global Change Research Program toward a user-driv-
en  research  endeavor:  H.R.  906.’’  I  am  James  R.  Mahoney,  and  I  currently  serve  as
an environmental consultant, providing scientific and professional advice to a num-
ber  of  organizations.  From  April  2,  2002  to  March  30,  2006  I  was  Assistant  Sec-
retary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere,  and  Deputy  Administrator  of  the
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA).  During  this  period  I
was  also  the  Director  of  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Program  (CCSP),  involv-
ing  13  federal  agencies  conducting  and  overseeing  total  annual  budgets  of  approxi-
mately  $2  billion  dedicated  to  scientific  research,  Earth  system  observations,  com-
puter simulations of future climate conditions, and evaluation of possible adaptation
and mitigation actions to address climate change. I reluctantly retired from my fed-
eral  appointment  approximately  one  year  ago  because  of  continuing  significant
health problems.

In  1966  I  received  the  Ph.D.  degree  in  meteorology  from  MIT,  with  a  specializa-
tion in geophysical fluid mechanics. Since that time I have had over 40 years contin-
uous  experience  in  science-based  environmental  management,  including  service  on
the  faculty  of  Harvard  University,  advisory  assignments  with  national  government
agencies  and  international  organizations  in  several  regions  of  the  world,  extensive
private  sector  environmental  assessment  and  design  work,  and  two  appointed  posi-
tions  with  the  U.S.  Federal  Government  (involving  overall  management  of  national
acid rain studies from 1988 to 1991, and climate science studies from 2002 to 2006).
A resume summarizing my experience follows this testimony.

In  response  to  Chairman  Lampson’s  letter  of  invitation,  my  testimony  today  pro-
vides my views about H.R. 906 from the specific perspective of my experience as Di-
rector of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program from 2002 to 2006. Also I make
recommendations  about  other,  supplementary  issues  that  the  Subcommittee  may
wish to consider during its continuing consideration of H.R. 906.
A. Overall comments:
1. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 is in need of significant updat-
ing.  H.R.  906  is  a  good  start.  In  its  final  version  it  would  be  helpful  for  the  re-
vised law to reflect the goal of expected significant improvements in the coverage
and level of detail available in climate information, and to call for major upgrad-
ing of the expected uses of climate information (measurements, analyses and pro-
jections) for the development of climate services, which will be the principal ac-
tions expected to be undertaken by climate information users.

2. A proper balance should be sought between ongoing climate research on
the one hand, and developing assessments and decision support applica-
tions on the other hand. H.R. 906 is on the right track in its emphasis on en-
hancing  the  importance  of  user  initiatives  and  applications  studies  in  the  devel-
opment  of  overall  climate  research  planning.  However,  it  would  be  highly  dam-

aging  to  the  international  efforts  to  better  adapt  to,  and  mitigate  the  effects  of,
extreme  climate  phenomena  if  the  support  for  exploratory  research  were  deeply
diminished  prematurely.  While  an  improved  consensus  about  the  core  question
of  human-caused  climate  change  has  emerged  in  recent  years,  very  little  is  cur-
rently  well  understood  about  many  climate  phenomena  that  pose  great  risks  for
a large number of human and ecosystem populations around the world. Examples
of poorly understood current climate issues include, among others, abrupt climate
change,  regional  variability  of  climate  parameters,  climate-ecosystem  inter-
actions,  and  the  (new)  levels  of  extreme  weather  conditions  that  may  occur  as
a result of changes in global, regional, and local climate patterns.

3. H.R.  906  appropriately  addresses  several  requirements  in  the  U.S.  cli-
mate  research  program  that  currently  need  improved  resources  and  ac-
tivities.  These  improvements  (compared  to  the  provisions  of  the  1990  Act,  and
compared  to  the  practices  that  have  emerged  in  the  17  years  since  the  adoption
of that Act) include (1) a more specific requirement for significant stakeholder en-
gagement  in  research  planning  and  in  the  use  of  the  climate  information  being
developed,  (2)  a  clear  requirement  for  sophisticated  information  management  to
address  the  massive  amount  of  new  climate  data  currently  being  collected,  and
the  further  expansion  of  these  data  sets  that  will  come  on  line  in  the  next  few
years,  (3)  a  clear  mandate  to  develop  policy  analysis  methods  capable  of  making
appropriate use of the large investment in climate information.

A. Structure and Resource Comments:
1. H.R.  906  does  not  specify  a  mechanism  for  funding  the  expanded  pro-
gram  responsibilities  envisioned  in  the  bill.  A  multiple-agency  program  is
still the most effective approach, but more legislative structure would better clar-
ify  individual  agency  roles.  The  multiple-agency  organization  of  the  program
makes sense, although there should be more careful delineation of roles between
agencies that are predominantly research oriented (e.g., NSF, NASA, DOE, parts
of  NOAA)  and  those  that  are  mission-oriented  and  thus  key  user  stakeholders.
This will streamline certain types of decision-making. A ‘‘user council’’ or similar
body  should  be  created  and  empowered  to  provide  input  on  directions  and  also
provide funding for user-oriented programs and products.

2. There  is  a  need  to  assure  the  independence  of  the  science  while  pro-
viding for committed overview by the politically appointed management
of the collaborating agencies. The CCSP activities initiated in 2002, including
the  10–Year  Strategic  Plan  for  CCSP  published  in  July  2003,  have  provided  a
highly useful framework for all CCSP studies. It is now timely to reevaluate and
update  the  major  elements  of  the  2002–2003  research  plan.  Regular  ongoing  in-
volvement of the National Academy of Sciences should be continued. This contin-
uous  review  function  has  been  placed  under  a  long-term  contract  basis  between
CCSP and the Academy, and should be maintained.

3. A  stronger  role  for  OMB  should  be  mandated  in  H.R.  906  to  facilitate
budgetary coordination across the agencies. CCSP has been reasonably suc-
cessful  in  achieving  interagency  research  coordination,  but  after  the  passage  of
five years it would be an appropriate time to assure the independence of the cli-
mate  research  program  by  providing  for  a  direct  role  for  OMB  in  the  oversight
of the multiple agency program.

4. H.R.  906  should  provide  the  program  with  two  budget  lines  under  the
control  of  the  interagency  committee  of  the  whole.  One  set  of  resources
would  be  used  to  fill  gaps  and  generate  new  research  thrusts  that  are  difficult
to support through individual agency mechanisms and for which there is a clear
need. A second set of resources would be used to support regional or national as-
sessment  and  decision  support  activities.  These  funds  could  be  awarded  on  a
competitive basis but would require a collective decision on the part of the inter-
agency process to be released.

5. The role of and funding for a coordination office should be explicitly in-
cluded  in  the  legislation.  This  funding  should  not  be  taken  out  of  research
funding.  The  current  practice  of  ‘‘taxing’’  research  funds  to  support  overall  pro-
gram  coordination  activities  has  historically  resulted  in  under  provision  of  re-
sources  for  the  coordination  and  management  function.  My  experience  over  the
past  several  years  suggests  that  an  adequately  funded  program  coordination  of-
fice is essential. With a growing emphasis on the coordination of assessments and
decision  support  studies,  even  more  ‘‘cross-cut’’  management  will  be  needed,  and
the funds for this type of program integration must be assured.

B. Other Important Suggestions
1. Unreasonable  timetables  are  currently  specified  by  H.R.  906.  The  current
draft bill calls for five separate reports to be completed within one year of enact-
ment. These include a new strategic plan, a policy review, a vulnerability assess-
ment, a data management plan, and an annual report. Given the need for exten-
sive multiple-agency drafting and review actions, as well as other reviews by user
groups and the scientific community, in my view it will be impossible for the pro-
gram to produce quality documents in all of the specified categories within a one-
year  time  frame.  I  suggest  that  the  time  for  delivery  of  this  first  set  of  informa-
tion be extended over two years or more.

2. An  overall  communications  strategy  should  be  included  in  H.R.  906.
Based  on  my  personal  experience  as  Director  of  the  National  Acid  Rain  Assess-
ment Program in the late 1980’s and as Director of CCSP for four years recently,
I earnestly recommend that responsibilities for communication and education ac-
tivities  be  incorporated  into  H.R.  906.  Without  a  clear  mandate  for  such  activi-
ties, it is almost impossible to obtain approval for communications and education
activities in the President’s budget. And without support for communications and
education  activities,  the  efficiency  of  transmitting  climate  change  information  to
potential users throughout the Nation will be seriously diminished.

3. The  assessment  reporting  requirements  in  H.R.  906  should  be  coordi-
nated  with  other  national  and  international  climate  reporting  cycles  al-
ready established. The  IPCC  Fourth  Assessment  is  currently  being  completed,
and  will  likely  be  followed  by  a  Fifth  Assessment  six  years  later  (i.e.,  in  2013).
During  approximately  a  two-year  period  of  drafting  and  review  for  the  IPCC  as-
sessment,  the  U.S.  climate  science  community  will  be  heavily  engaged  in  the
IPCC  international  assessment.  I  recommend  that  the  summary  assessments
specified in H.R. 906 be placed on a six-year schedule (at least after the first edi-
tion), and the schedule for the U.S. assessments be offset by approximately three
years form the delivery dates for the IPCC reports.
I  trust  my  suggestions  offered  here  may  be  useful  to  the  Subcommittee,  and  I

would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have. Thank you.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  FRANKLIN  W.  NUTTER,  PRESIDENT,  THE
REINSURANCE  ASSOCIATION  OF  AMERICA;  MEMBER  OF
UCAR’S BOARD OF TRUSTEES
Mr.  NUTTER.  Madam  Chair,  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank

you. It is an honor to appear before you.

Reinsurance is essentially the insurance of insurance companies.
Insurance  companies  traditionally  lay  off  risk,  particularly  catas-
trophe  risk,  notably  extreme  weather  events  to  the  reinsurance
market.

No financial services business is more dependent on the vagaries
of  climate  and  weather  than  property  and  casualty  insurers.  The
industry  is  at  great  risk  if  it  does  not  understand  climate  change
variability,  and  the  severity  and  frequency  of  extreme  events.  Un-
derstanding global climate change and integrating that information
into the insurance system is an essential part of addressing climate
extremes,  and  conveying  information  to  governments  and  the  pub-
lic  about  the  economic  consequences  of  human  activity  in  the  face
of a changing global climate.

We  believe  that  the  enactment  of  H.R.  906,  with  an  increased
emphasis on input to government climate research by user commu-
nities  such  as  ours,  will  greatly  enhance  adaptation  and  response
to the effect of climate and of global change. The industry looks at
climate change largely through the prism of the catastrophe losses
that  it  pays.  The  General  Accounting  Office  just  released  a  report
that from 1980 through 2005, private insurers and federal insurers,
meaning  the  National  Flood  Insurance  Program  and  the  Crop  In-
surance  Program,  paid  $320  billion  in  claims  on  weather-related
losses. The insurance industry paid two-thirds of those losses. 2005
alone  produced  a  record  year.  Total  global  insured  catastrophe
losses  were  $83  billion,  80  percent  of  which  were  U.S.  landfalling
hurricanes.

As bad as those numbers, AIR Worldwide estimates that insured
losses from natural catastrophes could be expected to double rough-
ly  every  ten  years.  With  respect  to  the  impact  of  climate  change
alone, fixing everything else in place, the Association of British In-
surers  concludes  that  the  average  annual  losses  from  three  major
storm  types  affecting  insurance  markets,  that  is  U.S.  hurricanes,
Japanese  typhoons,  and  European  windstorms,  could  increase  by
two-thirds  by  the  2080s.  Climate  change  could  increase  wind-re-
lated  insured  losses  from  extreme  U.S.  hurricanes  by  about  three
quarters,  the  equivalent  of  two  to  three  Hurricane  Andrews  annu-
ally. The ABI advises that these loss estimates do not include likely
increases  in  society’s  exposure  to  extreme  storms  due  to  growing
wealthier populations and increasing assets at risk. These are their
assessments based upon the impact of climate change.

The  catastrophe  modeling  firm  Risk  Management  Solutions  ad-
vises  that  financial  losses  from  weather-related  catastrophes  have
increased  by  an  average  of  two  percent  per  year  since  the  1970s,
with  climate  change  as  a  major  factor,  even  when  inflation,
changes in wealth and population, are taken into account.

It is quite clear that there are several factors affecting the losses
associated  with  extreme  events,  including  population  growth  in
high  risk  areas,  certainly  people  moving  to  those  areas,  the  dra-
matic  increases  in  insured  coastal  values,  the  insurance  industry’s
own  expansion  of  coverage,  climate  change,  and  the  incidence  of
more intense extreme events.

We believe that H.R. 906, with greater emphasis on basic climate
research,  coordination  among  sponsoring  government  agencies,  im-
proved  integration  of  user  needs  into  the  research  agenda,  and  ac-
cess  to  climate  data  will  enhance  risk  assessment,  and  lead  to  im-
proved insurance markets.

In  this  regard,  our  sector  needs  science-based  business  intel-
ligence.  A  key  component  of  the  Global  Climate  Change  Research

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Program is observation technologies. It will be critical to our ability
to  provide  insurance  markets  that  climate  and  weather  data
through observation capabilities be maintained.

Perhaps the most relevant aspect of the insurance industry, with
respect to science assessment and extreme events, is the use of ca-
tastrophe  models.  These  models  incorporate  scientific  assumptions
about  climate  trends  and  the  probability  of  future  events,  then
produce estimates of prospective costs associated with these events.
In  the  context  of  the  Global  Climate  Change  Research  Program
and  its  reauthorization  pursuant  to  H.R.  906,  our  industry  would
benefit  from  enhanced  research  on  historical  extreme  events,  par-
ticularly those which predate satellite technology. Climate research
which  addresses  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  the  frequency  and
intensity  of  extreme  events  would  be  of  great  value.  Additionally,
the  consequences  of  climate  change  on  extreme  weather  regionally
would improve insurer adaptation strategies.

A key component of this agenda, again, are observation capabili-
ties. Our industry is taking steps to adjust to climate change, even
though  there  is  no  insurance  policy  that  covers  climate  change.  It
is  our  belief  that  H.R.  906  will  be  of  great  value  in  improving  our
capability. Insurers are in the business of assessing risk, pricing it,
and  providing  financing  or  risk  transfer.  Its  long-term  strategy,
however, does not include bearing the costs of climate change with-
out  a  commitment  on  the  part  of  society  to  pursue  a  mitigation
strategy  addressing  both  the  causes  and  consequences  of  climate
change.

H.R.  906  is  to  be  commended  as  placing  greater  weight  on  basic
research,  that  emphasizes  user  needs,  and  maintains  or  enhances
observation capabilities, the coordination of research with the glob-
al research community, as well as private sector resources.

Thank you very much.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Nutter follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF FRANKLIN W. NUTTER

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Bartlett  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee
on Energy and Environment:

My  name  is  Frank  Nutter  and  I  am  President  of  the  Reinsurance  Association  of
America (RAA). It is an honor to appear before you on behalf of the RAA. The RAA
is a national trade association representing property and casualty organizations that
specialize  in  assuming  reinsurance.  Together,  RAA  members  and  affiliates  write
over 70 percent of the reinsurance coverage provided by U.S. property and casualty
reinsurers and affiliates.

No  financial  services  business  is  more  dependent  on  the  vagaries  of  climate  and
weather than property and casualty insurers. The industry is at great risk if it does
not understand global climate variability and the severity and frequency of extreme
events.  It  must  be  more  than  a  pass-through  mechanism  for  the  costs  associated
with  natural  disasters.  Understanding  global  climate  change  and  integrating  that
information into the insurance system is an essential part of addressing climate ex-
tremes  and  conveying  information  to  governments  and  the  public  about  the  eco-
nomic consequences of human activity in the face of changing global climate.

We  believe  that  the  enactment  of  H.R.  906,  the  Global  Climate  Change  Research
Data and Management Act of 2007, with an increased emphasis on input to govern-
ment climate research by user communities will greatly enhance adaptation and re-
sponse to the effects of global change.
Climate and Catastrophes

The  General  Accounting  Office  reports  that  from  1980  through  2005  private  and
federal insurers paid $320 billion in claims on weather related losses. The insurance
industry  paid  two-thirds  of  those  losses.  The  number  of  insured  natural  catas-

trophes has doubled since 1990; the insured losses in this decade already exceed the
decade of the 1990s. The year 2005 alone produced a record: total global insurer ca-
tastrophe  claims  were  $83  billion,  80  percent  of  which  were  from  U.S.  land-falling
hurricanes.  Even  2006,  thought  of  as  a  benign  catastrophe  year,  produced  43  in-
sured loss catastrophes in North America out of a global total of 349. Although some
of  these  catastrophes  are  earthquake  related,  over  90  percent  of  events  causing
damage  to  people  and  property  originated  in  the  atmosphere.  Almost  12,000  people
lost their lives to storms and floods in 2006. AIR Worldwide estimates that insured
losses  from  natural  catastrophes  should  be  expected  to  double  roughly  every  ten
years  due  to  increases  in  construction  costs,  increases  in  the  number  of  structures
and changes in their characteristics.

With  respect  to  the  impact  of  climate  change,  the  Association  of  British  Insurers

concludes as follows:

• Average  annual  losses  from  the  three  major  storm  types  affecting  insurance
markets  (U.S.  hurricanes,  Japanese  typhoons  and  European  windstorms)
could increase by two-thirds by the 2080s.

• Focusing  on  the  most  extreme  storms  (losses  with  a  probability  of  occurring

once every 100 to 250 years), by the 2080s climate change could:

— Increase  wind-related  insured  losses  from  extreme  U.S.  hurricanes  by
around  three-quarters  (the  equivalent  of  two  to  three  Hurricane  An-
drews annually).

— Increase wind-related insured losses from extreme Japanese typhoons by
around two-thirds. The increase alone would be more than twice the cost
of the 2004 typhoon season, the costliest in the last 100 years.

— Increase  wind-related  insured  losses  from  extreme  European  storms  by

at least five percent.

— Increase the annual costs of flooding in the UK almost 15-fold.

• Under high emissions scenarios, insurers’ capital requirements could increase
by  over  90  percent  for  U.S.  hurricanes,  and  by  80  percent  for  Japanese  ty-
phoons. Higher capital costs combined with greater annual losses from wind-
storms alone could result in premium increases of around 60 percent in these
markets.

The  ABI  advises  that  these  loss  estimates  do  not  include  likely  increases  in  soci-
ety’s  exposure  to  extreme  storms,  due  to  growing,  wealthier  populations,  and  in-
creasing assets at risk.

Financial  losses  from  weather-related  catastrophes  have  increased  by  an  average
of  two  percent  per  year  since  the  1970s,  with  climate  change  a  major  contributing
factor,  according  to  the  chief  researcher  of  catastrophe  modeler  Risk  Management
Solutions,  Inc.  The  rate  of  loss  increase  holds  true  even  when  inflation,  changes  in
wealth  and  population  growth  are  taken  into  account.  In  its  latest  climate  change
report,  Rapid  Climate  Change,  Lloyd’s  of  London  warns  that  waiting  on  ‘‘definitive
scientific  pronouncements’’  on  the  impact  of  climate  change  ‘‘seems  like  an  increas-
ingly risky strategy.’’

The causes behind the dramatic rise in insured catastrophe losses are several:

• Population growth in high-risk areas. Dramatic increases in high risk coastal
areas  suggest  people  and  local  governments  have  placed  too  little  emphasis
on exposure to weather risk in a changing climate environment.

• Dramatic increases in insured coastal values. Florida now has nearly $2 tril-
lion  of  insured  coastal  properties.  New  York  has  $2  trillion,  Louisiana  $209
billion and South Carolina $149 billion.

• The  insurance  industry’s  own  expansion  of  coverage  which  had  the  effect  of
increasing  potential  insured  damage;  deductibles  were  lowered  and  full  re-
placement  cost  added  to  homeowners’  policies  in  the  period  1970–1990.  Gov-
ernment policy, which either endorsed weak building codes or failed to enforce
existing  building  codes  and  which  has  facilitated  development  in  high  risk
areas. Recent State government initiatives are encouraging however.

• Climate  change  and  the  incidence  of  more  intense  extreme  events.  Munich
Re’s  Geo-Science  Department  has  concluded  that  the  proportion  of  severe
storms  has  risen  and  that  of  moderate  storms  has  fallen.  Three  of  the  ten
most intense storms ever recorded in North America were in 2005.

The Insurance Industry’s Financial Interest

The  insurance  industry’s  financial  interest  is  inter-dependent  with  climate  and
weather. It is the risk of natural events which drives the demand for insurance cov-
erage  and  yet,  if  not  properly  managed,  can  threaten  the  viability  of  an  insurer  if
it  is  over-exposed  in  high  risk  areas.  An  insurance  company  thrives  or  dies  on  its
ability to make estimates of the economic consequences of future events.

We believe pursuant to H.R. 906, greater emphasis on basic climate research, co-
ordination  among  sponsoring  government  agencies,  improved  integration  of  user
needs into the research agenda, and access to climate data will enhance risk assess-
ment by insurers and lead to improved insurance markets.
Insurance and Science

Although  a  number  of  European  insurers  and  reinsurers  have  shown  greater  in-
terest in understanding the causes of climate change, including the impact of global
warming,  U.S.  insurers  have  been  more  focused  on  the  effect  of  natural  disasters.
Thus, the U.S. industry has been more attentive to approaches to mitigate the con-
sequences of natural catastrophes and other extreme events. Some European insur-
ers  have  called  upon  their  governments  to  reduce  the  human  factors  they  believe
contribute  to  global  warming.  In  the  U.S.,  the  industry’s  agenda  includes  the  eval-
uation  of  building  codes  and  building  code  enforcement  in  every  community  in  the
country.  Additionally,  through  the  Institute  for  Business  &  Home  Safety,  the  U.S.
industry  has  greatly  enhanced  its  support  for  hazard  mitigation  by  conducting  re-
search  on  building  design  and  building  materials.  Improved  research  on  the  likely
impact  of  climate  change  on  extreme  weather  and  the  built  environment  will  im-
prove society’s hazard mitigation adaptation.

The  initiative  most  related  to  science  and  scientific  assessment  of  global  climate
change  is  the  use  of  catastrophe  computer  models  to  integrate  scientific  knowledge
about climate into the actuarial sciences. These catastrophe models incorporate sci-
entific  assumptions  about  climate  trends  and  the  probability  of  future  extreme
events  and  then  produce  estimated  prospective  costs  associated  with  natural  catas-
trophes.  They  assist  an  insurer  with  an  analysis  of  its  potential  exposure  and  are
used to support rates filed for approval with insurance departments. It is the classic
example  of  using  insurance  to  translate  scientific  analysis  and  data  into  the  eco-
nomic consequences of people’s behavior, i.e., where they live and the value and po-
tential  loss  of  properties  in  those  areas.  The  pure  result  of  the  use  of  catastrophe
models  is  the  application  of  risk-based  premiums  and  the  understanding  of  aggre-
gate exposure for insured property.

In the context of the Global Climate Change Research Program and its reauthor-
ization  pursuant  to  H.R.  906,  the  industry  would  benefit  from  enhanced  research
on  historical  extreme  events;  particularly  those  which  pre-date  satellite  technology.
Climate research which addresses the effect of climate change on the frequency and
intensity of extreme weather would be of great value. Additionally, the consequences
of  climate  change  on  extreme  weather  regionally  would  improve  insurer  adaptation
strategies.
Insurance Related Adaptive Product Strategies

Although insurance often covers damages from climate related events, there is no
insurance policy with specific coverage related to climate change. Insurers and bro-
kers  have  however  announced  the  development  of  several  climate  related  financial
products:

farms (Lloyd’s of London)

in global trading of emissions credits (an options contract) (Swiss Re)

• Carbon emissions credit delivery guarantees providing coverage for non-deliv-
ery  of  credits  due  to  project  insolvency,  political  and  investment  risk,  oper-
ational problems (Marsh)
• Insurance  for  one-third  of  waste  to  energy  plants  and  one-quarter  of  wind
• A  risk  financing  product  that  facilitates  trade  by  companies  that  participate
• A  financial  product  that  provides  a  buyer  for  carbon  credits  in  the  secondary
• Directors  and  officers  liability  coverage  for  failure  to  address  corporate  com-
• New risk transfer products for weather related damages: ‘‘Cat Bonds’’ ($5 bil-
lion were issued in 2006, $30 billion since 1996); weather derivatives ($45 bil-
lion in notional value in 2005–6)
• Exchange  traded  weather  securities  (Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange  and  the

market if the primary buyer fails to deliver (Munich Re)

pliance with government regulations (Swiss Re)

New York Mercantile Exchange with Gallagher Re (2007) )

Industry  observers  also  note  that,  as  an  adaptive  strategy,  insurers  should  focus
research on energy efficient technologies that have the potential to reduce ordinary
insured losses. They also encourage the development of insurance products with pre-
mium discounts that reward safety enhancing energy efficiency. In addition, the in-
dustry has been encouraged to increase in its investment portfolio energy efficiency
oriented investments.

In a world where ‘‘reducing carbon dioxide emissions from a high to a low scenario
would  reduce  the  impact  on  losses  and  insurers’  capital  requirement  for  extreme
windstorms by 80 percent’’ (Association of British Insurers), the industry is showing
signs  of  initiative  to  address  carbon  related  climate  concerns.  AIG  recently  (April
2007)  joined  as  the  first  insurer  in  the  U.S.  Climate  Action  Partnership  (CAP),
whose  goal  is  a  U.S.  cap  and  trade  system.  Prudential  Financial  and  Hartford  Fi-
nancial Services have agreed to disclose to shareholders the potential financial risk
they  face  from  climate  change  (April  2007).  Swiss  Re  set  a  target  of  being  green-
house neutral in its business operations by 2013.
Conclusion

Insurers are in the business of assessing risk, pricing it and providing risk financ-
ing  or  transfer.  The  insurance  industry’s  long-term  strategy,  however,  does  not  in-
clude bearing the cost of climate change without a commitment on the part of soci-
ety to pursue a mitigation strategy—addressing the causes and consequences of cli-
mate  change.  H.R.  906  is  to  be  commended  as  placing  greater  weight  on  basic  re-
search  that  emphasizes  user  needs  and  priorities  and  the  coordination  of  research
with  the  global  research  community,  including  public,  academic  and  private  re-
sources.

BIOGRAPHY FOR FRANKLIN W. NUTTER

Frank  Nutter  has  been  President  of  the  Reinsurance  Association  of  America
(RAA) since May of 1991. He held the same position with the RAA from 1981–1984.

Property  Loss  Research  Bureau,  which  have  now  merged  to  be  part  of  the  PCI
(Property Casualty Insurance Association of America).

Mr.  Nutter  currently  serves  on  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  Bermuda  Biological
Station for Research; the Board of the International Hurricane Center; the Advisory
Board of the Center for Health and the Global Environment, an adjunct to the Har-
vard University Medical School; and the Board of the University Center for Atmos-
pheric  Research,  a  consortium  of  universities  funded  primarily  by  the  National
Science Foundation. He currently serves on the Advisory Board of the OECD’s Inter-
national Network for the Financial Management of Large Scale Disasters.

Mr.  Nutter  has  a  Juris  Doctorate  from  the  Georgetown  University  Law  Center

and a Bachelor’s degree in economics.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Nutter. Gentleman, I think prob-
ably the best plan would be to go to Dr. Mote. We have 15 minutes
to  get  to  the  Floor  to  vote,  and  if  we  can  keep  your  testimony,
again,  to  five  minutes,  then  we  will  recess,  and  hopefully,  see  you
all back after—we have a series of votes, so we can’t split the group
up, and have half go, and half come back.

So,  Dr.  Mote,  we  will  go  to  you,  and  then,  we  will  recess,  and

come back afterwards.
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  PHILIP  W.  MOTE,  CLIMATE  IMPACTS
GROUP,  UNIVERSITY  OF  WASHINGTON;  OFFICE  OF  WASH-
INGTON  STATE  CLIMATOLOGIST  AND  AFFILIATE  PRO-
FESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
Dr.  MOTE.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  for  your  interest  in  climate  monitoring  research  and  appli-
cations. I am Philip Mote, and I am a research scientist.

I  am  involved  in  the  Pacific  Northwest  Climate  Impacts  Group
which,  since  1995,  has  been  articulating  how  climate  influences
natural  resources,  not  just  climate  change,  but  climate  variability.
And  we  have  also  made  great  strides  in  discussing  these  findings

with  natural  resource  managers,  getting  their  perspective,  what
they  need,  and  what  information  they  need  from  us.  So,  I  have
been  on  both  sides  of,  you  know,  doing  basic  science  research,  and
also,  more  applied  science.  The  Climate  Impacts  Group  is  one  of
eight  regionally  funded  teams  funded  by  NOAA’s  Regional  Inte-
grated  Sciences  and  Assessments  Program.  Unfortunately,  the
whole country is not covered or served by RISA programs.

As  the  science  of  climate  variability  and  change  has  advanced
tremendously  since  1990,  so  too  have  the  societal  demands  for  in-
formation about climate and what it means locally. Some examples
of  how  climate  has  advanced:  climate  models  now  consist  of  elabo-
rate components that simulate the ocean and sea ice, land surface,
biosphere,  carbon  cycle,  as  well  as  the  atmosphere,  and  our  re-
gional  models  are  now  capable  of  simulating  climate  in  great  deal
regionally.  And  there  is,  in  fact,  a  program  underway  called
NARCCAP,  the  North  American  Regional  Climate  Change  Assess-
ment  Program,  which  is  combining  regional  climate  modeling  for
the  whole  country,  coordinated  by  the  National  Center  for  Atmos-
pheric Research.

There  have  also  been  tremendous  advances  in  paleoclimate,  our
ability  to  use  tree  rings  and  other  so-called  proxies  to  understand
climate  over  timescales  of  hundreds  to  thousands  of  years,  that
provide the context for understanding our current climate and pos-
sible future climate.

Let me give you some examples of information that stakeholders
have sought from the Climate Impacts Group or from the Office of
Washington State Climatologists. Water utilities around the North-
west  are  factoring  in  climate  change  to  long  range  plans,  so  they
want  to  know  what  are  the  probable  changes  in  temperature,  pre-
cipitation, snowmelt, streamflow, so that they can incorporate that,
as  well  as  population  and  demand  changes,  into  their  plans  and
their policies.

The Northwest Power and Conservation Council wanted very de-
tailed  streamflow  estimates  for  future  decades,  so  that  they  could
calculate  changes  in  hydropower  production  from  the  Columbia
River basin, and the hydropower dams there. The U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers is starting to think about what does it mean to change
flood  control  rule  curves  that  govern  reservoirs,  given  that  there
has  already  been  an  observed  shift  of  two  weeks  in  the  spring
snowmelt.  There  is  no  policy  that  currently  would  allow  them  to
make that move, but for starters, they need good, detailed informa-
tion.  A  natural  gas  utility  wanted  help  demonstrating  to  the  state
Utilities  and  Transportation  Commission  that  warming  trends
have  rendered  obsolete  the  old  assumption  of  constant  climate  by
which their rates are set.

So,  a  regional  and  State  level  focus  is  very  valuable  for  con-
necting  with  these  stakeholder  needs,  and  providing  climate  serv-
ices. In a number of respects, a national level effort, a National Cli-
mate Service, is needed, that would take the basic research that is
provided  by  modeling  centers  and  analysis,  and  translate  into
stakeholder needs.

National  level  expertise  in  climate  science  can  provide  the  high-
est  quality,  most  comprehensive  information  about  patterns  of  cli-
mate  variation  and  change,  both  from  the  past  and  from  future

modeling.  Such  expertise  can  be  brought  to  bear  on  problems  that
may  be  too  difficult  for  a  single  regional  group  to  solve.  For  exam-
ple,  to  properly  construct  probabilistic  scenarios  of  future  climate
change  at  a  given  location  would  ideally  involve  evaluating  sce-
narios  from  tens  of  climate  models  against  the  observed  record  of
the  20th  Century,  and  then  weighting  their  projects  of  future
change according to how well they did with the past. This is a task
that  is  both  computationally  and  conceptually  probably  too  chal-
lenging for a regional team like ours to undertake.

Another challenge would be the construction of sea level rise sce-
narios,  factoring  in  not  just  global  sea  level  rise,  but  local  relative
land  movements,  obviously  of  great  concern  in  the  tourist-friendly
beaches  of  South  Carolina,  which  I  had  the  good  fortunes  to  visit
a year or two ago. All of these things, all these types of information
are needed on very fine local scales, and can be provided by a com-
prehensive national effort.

Finally,  a  word  about  the  unglamorous  topic  of  monitoring  the
climate, which H.R. 906 rightly addresses. As numerous reports by
the  National  Research  Council  and  others  have  documented,  the
Nation’s  various  observing  networks  and,  notably,  the  cooperative
observer network that forms the backbone of long-term weather ob-
servations,  and  the  streamgauge  network  of  the  U.S.  Geological
Survey, are slowly dwindling in coverage and, in some cases, qual-
ity. A vigorous effort is urgently needed to preserve these networks
as  our  primary  source  of  information  for  documenting  the  changes
in our environment and our climate over the 20th Century and into
the  21st  Century,  in  order  to  understand  how  best  to  cope  with
these  changes.  The  American  Association  of  State  Climatologists
calls on the 110th Congress to rescue these networks from decline.
Finally,  a  National  Climate  Service,  with  high  level  buy-in  from
the Administration and the various agencies would serve the needs
for  climate  information  of  a  wide  spectrum  of  private  and  public
sector entities, and H.R. 906 points us in that direction.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Mote follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PHILIP W. MOTE

Summary

As  the  science  of  climate  variability  and  change  has  advanced  and  as  public
awareness of its implications for natural resource management and economic activ-
ity  has  grown,  demands  for  climate  information  have  rapidly  exceeded  the  capacity
of  experts.  Significant  federal  investment  is  needed  in  a  National  Climate  Service
to  match  these  growing  needs.  H.R.  906  aims  in  that  direction  by  calling  for  im-
proved direction of federally funded climate research.
Regional focus

For several reasons, a regional focus on research and delivery of climate informa-
tion  is  appropriate.  First,  economic  and  natural  resources  emphases  differ  starkly
from  region  to  region,  and  in  some  cases  are  organized  regionally  (for  example,  the
Northwest  Power  and  Conservation  Council).  Second,  a  regional  focus  matches  re-
gional  decision-makers  and  regional  scientists  whose  very  proximity  permits  sus-
tained interactions, understanding, and trust to develop.

NOAA’s  Climate  Program  Office  meets  some  needs  for  climate  information  by
leading  and  funding  efforts  such  as  the  Regional  Integrated  Sciences  and  Assess-
ments  (RISA)  program.  RISA  projects  point  the  way  toward  a  new  paradigm  of
stakeholder-driven  climate  sciences  that  directly  address  society’s  needs  and  con-
cerns.

The  RISA  program  began  with  university-based  efforts  in  regions  of  the  United
States where recent advances in integrated climate sciences held the greatest prom-
ise  to  assist  decision-making.  Much  of  the  first-generation  RISA  success  built  on

breakthroughs in predicting variability, change, and impacts of climate processes oc-
curring  in  the  tropical  Pacific  Ocean.  This  is  the  area  where  El  Nin˜ o  and  La  Nin˜ a
conditions,  which  affect  much  of  the  western  and  southern  United  States,  as  well
as Mexico, originate.

RISA  scientists  provide  information  that  decision-makers  can  use  to  cope  with
drought,  understand  climatic  influences  on  wildfire,  and  assess  climate  impacts  on
the transportation sector, coastal communities and human health. Stakeholders can
use such information to evaluate potential climate change impacts on water supplies
and  hydroelectric  power  and  support  disaster  management  planning.  RISAs  are
helping  farmers,  ranchers,  and  fishermen  use  climate  information  to  produce  the
Nation’s  foods  and  fibers,  and  Pacific  Islanders  to  figure  out  how  to  weave  climate
information into their quest for sustainability.

With  each  passing  year,  the  impacts  of  climate  variability  and  change  on  water
availability,  wildfire  regimes,  public  health,  agriculture,  energy  issues,  and  coastal
communities  become  more  acute.  At  the  same  time,  climate  sciences  are  making
great  strides  in  producing  knowledge  that  could  aid  decision-makers  dealing  with
these issues.

University  of  Washington’s  Climate  Impacts  Group  (CIG)  was  the  first  project
funded  by  RISA’s  predecessor,  in  1995,  and  there  are  now  a  total  of  eight  regional
projects.  CIG  has  developed  close  connections  with  the  public,  private,  and  North
American  tribal  groups  and  agencies  responsible  for  managing  the  region’s  water,
forest, fishery, and coastal resources in order to ensure that our research results in
information  and  products  that  are  not  only  useful,  but  also  used  to  shape  decisions
in  the  PNW.  As  a  result  of  this  interaction,  CIG  has  gained  a  clear  picture  of  the
current  use  and  perceived  value  of  climate  forecasts  by  natural  resource  managers,
insight into their decision calendars, and an understanding of institutional barriers
to adaptability. Stakeholders benefit from the development of improved tools and in-
formation  for  planning,  such  as  resource  forecasts  and  regional-  and  resource-spe-
cific interpretations of global climate change. Members of CIG’s stakeholder commu-
nity  are  listed  in  Appendix  A.  A  sustained  regional  focus  over  the  course  of  more
than  a  decade  has  allowed  deep  two-way  interactions  to  develop,  with  scientists
learning from natural resource managers and vice versa toward a shared goal of im-
proving resilience to climate variations and change.

In addition to regional focus, the Nation’s State Climatologists serve their respec-
tive states. While the primary focus of most State climatologists is delivering weath-
er  and  climate  data,  many  also  develop  higher-level  products  in  response  to  stake-
holder needs, for example, specialized tools for drought monitoring.
National expertise, sectoral focus

While  regional-  and  State-level  focus  is  a  critical  part  of  climate  services,  in  a
number of respects a national-level effort is also needed. National-level expertise in
climate  science  can  provide  the  highest-quality,  most  comprehensive  information
about  patterns  of  climate  variation  and  change.  Such  expertise  can  be  brought  to
bear  on  problems  that  may  be  too  difficult  for  a  single  regional  group  to  solve.  For
example,  to  properly  construct  probabilistic  scenarios  of  future  climate  at  a  given
location would ideally involve evaluating tens of scenarios from global climate mod-
els  and  weighting  them  appropriately  according  to  their  fidelity  at  simulating  past
climate,  a  task  that  is  both  computationally  and  conceptually  challenging.  Another
example  would  be  the  construction  of  probabilistic  sea  level  rise  scenarios  account-
ing  for  global  sea  level  change,  local  relative  land  motions,  possible  contributions
from  changes  in  atmospheric  circulation,  etc.  Finally,  as  the  Federal  Emergency
Management  Agency  undertakes  the  redrawing  of  food  plain  maps  nationwide,  a
thorough  probabilistic  assessment  of  the  possible  changes  in  food  risk  associated
with climate change could best be accomplished by a national-scale effort.
Preserving observation networks

As  numerous  reports  by  the  National  Research  Council  and  others  have  docu-
mented,  the  Nation’s  various  observing  networks  and  notably  the  Cooperative  Ob-
server  Network  are  slowly  dwindling  in  coverage  and  quality.  An  urgent  effort  is
needed to preserve these networks as a legacy for future generations and as our pri-
mary  source  of  information  for  documenting  the  changes  in  our  environment  and
our  climate,  whether  these  changes  be  natural  or  man-made.  See  also  the  attached
letter from the American Association of State Climatologists.
Why undertake a new National Assessment

In  the  roughly  ten  years  since  the  first  National  Assessment  was  begun,  the
science of climate change has advanced immensely. Atmospheric general circulation
models  (AGCMs)  have  been  replaced  by  climate  system  models  that  simulate  also
the ocean, land surface processes, sea ice, and even components of the biosphere and

carbon  cycle  in  tremendous  detail.  Hundreds  of  simulations  have  been  performed
with these models describing the evolution of the climate from 1900 to 2100, allow-
ing  comparisons  with  past  climate  and  projections  of  future  climate.  Attribution  of
climate  change  to  human  activity  can  now  be  performed  not  just  for  globally  aver-
aged temperature but for sub-continental temperature changes and also for changes
in  other,  more  societally-relevant  climate  variables.  Paleoclimate  research  has  dra-
matically  improved  our  understanding  of  past  climate  variability  and  change.  Fi-
nally, regional climate modeling has also advanced, permitting much higher resolu-
tion  simulations  and  better  information  over  complex  terrain  such  as  the  moun-
tainous  West.  A  comprehensive  effort  at  regional  modeling  is  underway,  called
North  American  Regional  Climate  Change  Assessment  Program  (NARCCAP),  co-
ordinated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

In  addition  to  significant  advances  in  the  science,  a  second  reason  to  undertake
a  new  National  Assessment  is  that  attitudes  toward  climate  have  advanced.  Offi-
cials  with  federal,  State,  regional,  local  agencies,  private  companies,  consultants,
and  others,  are  wondering  how  to  incorporate  the  best  information  about  climate
change  into  plans,  policies,  and  reports.  Members  of  RISA  teams,  like  the  Climate
Impacts  Group,  are  straining  to  meet  the  demands  for  information.  These  requests
come to CIG in the form of specific questions, requests for academic papers, requests
for data including detailed probabilistic climate scenarios, in-person presentations at
the  rate  of  about  150/year,  media  interviews,  analysis  of  climate  variables,  expla-
nations of or comments on controversial points, and requests to review reports, web
sites, and the like. These questions can be answered in limited fashion by the exist-
ing network of RISA programs and State climatologists.

Far  better  would  be  to  match  national  capabilities  in  science  research  with  re-
gional and sectoral needs for climate information, especially if a national assessment
led to creation of a National Climate Service that included additional regional teams
covering  areas  of  the  country  not  currently  served  by  the  RISA  program.  These  ca-
pabilities  were  suggested  in  the  President’s  Climate  Change  Science  Program,  in
which  one  of  the  goals  was  Decision  Support,  but  few  resources  were  devoted  to
making decision support a reality.
Tasks to create a National Assessment and National Climate Service

Creating  new  regional  teams  and  strong  sectoral  assessment  capabilities  would
require  significant  agency  investment  not  just  in  dollars  but  in  effort  and  time.  A
thorough  assessment  would  require  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  per  year,  scaling  up
the  funds  that  support  the  existing  eight  regional  assessment  teams  in  the  RISA
program  to  a  comparable  effort  that  would  serve  the  entire  Nation  geographically
and in addition would create sectorally based assessment efforts. As was learned in
the  first  national  assessment,  substantial  effort  is  required  to  get  federal  agencies
to  work  together  for  a  common  purpose.  Finally,  the  timeline  should  be  at  least
three years from the availability of funding to the delivery of a report. This amount
of  time  is  required  to  constitute  new  teams,  forge  partnerships  between  key  stake-
holders and scientists, and write and peer-review a set of reports.

Beyond  the  production  of  a  report,  the  National  Assessment  should  catalyze  the
creation  of  networks  for  delivering  useful  climate  information  and  reducing  societal
vulnerability to climate variation and change. A useful prototype of such a network
is the National Integrated Drought Information System, which seeks to combine the
skills  and  resources  of  federal  agencies  in  producing  timely  drought  analysis  and
warnings, and in finding ways to reduce societal vulnerability to drought.

BIOGRAPHY FOR PHILIP W. MOTE

Dr. Philip Mote is a research scientist at the University of Washington, in the Cli-
mate Impacts Group (CIG), and an Affiliate Professor in the Department of Atmos-
pheric  Sciences.  His  research  interest  include  Northwest  climate  and  its  effects  on
snowpack, streamflow, and forest fires. A frequent public speaker, he has also writ-
ten  more  than  60  scientific  articles  and  edited  a  book  on  climate  modeling,  pub-
lished  in  2000.  In  2003  he  became  the  Washington  State  Climatologist.  He  served
as a lead author of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change released in 2007.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Mote.  The  Committee  stands  in

recess.

[Whereupon,  at  2:51  p.m.,  the  Subcommittee  recessed,  to  recon-

Mr.  UDALL.  [Presiding]  The  hearing  will  come  to  order.  I  want
to thank the panelists for your patience. I am going to sit in as Act-
ing  Chair  for  Congresswoman  Giffords,  who  was  required  to  go  to
the airport and return to her home in Arizona.

We  will  pick  up  back  with  Ms.  Bittleman  for  her  five  minutes,
and  then,  I  would  tell  the  panel  we  will  do  all  that  we  can  to  end
at the latest, by 4:00, perhaps five or ten minutes early, but we do
want to take advantage of your expertise and your presence.

Ms. Bittleman, the five minutes is yours.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  SARAH  BITTLEMAN,  DIRECTOR,  WASH-
INGTON,  D.C.,  OFFICE  OF  THE  GOVERNOR  OF  OREGON,
THEODORE  R.  KULONGOSKI,  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  WESTERN
GOVERNORS’ ASSOCIATION
Ms. BITTLEMAN. Thank you very much, sir.
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Committee  today
regarding  H.R.  906.  My  name  is  Sarah  Bittleman.  I  work  for  the
Governor  of  Oregon,  Governor  Kulongoski,  here  in  Washington,
D.C.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  sponsors,  Representative  Udall  and
Representative  Inglis  especially,  for  their  bipartisan  effort  on  this
bill, as well as for their outreach to the Western states in its devel-
opment.  The  Western  Governors  Association,  which  I  am  rep-
resenting  here  today,  appreciates  the  specific  effort  to  make  this
bill relevant to and address the needs of the states.

With the efforts occurring in Oregon and in many Western states
to  address  climate  change,  the  Western  Governors  believe  it  is  not
only appropriate, but it is also necessary to reorient and fully fund
the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  to  make  it  more  user-
driven.  The  U.S.  has  spent  considerable  dollars  on  understanding
the science of climate change. Now is the time to address and ade-
quately  fund  the  issue  of  adaptation.  How  will  climate  change
manifest itself in different areas of the country? What impacts can
we  expect  at  the  State  and  local  levels?  How  can  we  prepare  for
the  change  in  an  effort  to  avoid  or  mitigate  the  impacts?  How  can
we  most  effectively  implement  adaptation  measures,  given  that
many of them need a long lead time?

At  the  risk  of  sounding  like  an  advertisement  for  a  summer
blockbuster  movie,  I  need  to  recite  some  of  the  very  real  effects  of
climate  change  projected 
the  American  West:  smaller
snowpacks that lead to water shortages; earlier snowmelt that lead
to water shortages; and yet, more extreme floods; more evaporation
and  dryness;  less  groundwater;  more  drought;  more  wildfires;  pest

and disease, more of them affecting our agricultural crops and for-
ests.

I  don’t  think  I  need  to  remind  the  Members  of  the  Committee
that  there  are  already  substantial  stressors  on  water  in  the  West
today. Given global climate change, we expect additional ones. The
Western  Governors  stated  in  their  2006  report,  entitled  ‘‘Water
Needs and Strategies for a Sustainable Future,’’ that Congress and
the  Administration  should  fund  research  that  makes  it  easier  to
predict and mitigate climate change impacts.

The  Governors  believe  Title  I  of  H.R.  906  would  appropriately
focus the research of the U.S. Global Change Research Program on
improving  the  understanding  of  global  climate  change,  responding
to  the  information  needs  of  communities  and  decision-makers,  and
providing  periodic  assessments  of  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  U.S.
and other regions to global climate change. In other words, making
the program more user-driven and user-friendly.

Some  states  are  already  creating  their  own  climate  change  re-
search  centers, 
including  Oregon.  In  May  2006,  Governor
Kulongoski  created  the  Climate  Change  Integration  Group  to  de-
velop a climate change strategy for Oregon that provides long-term
sustainability for the environment, protects public health, considers
social  equity,  creates  economic  opportunity,  and  expands  public
awareness.  Their  main  focus  has  been  on  adapting  to  climate
change.

It  is  important  that  the  program  created  under  H.R.  906  inte-
grates and supports the State efforts that are already in existence,
like the one in Oregon and across the West, as well as regional cli-
mate  research  and  application  centers.  This  includes  the  State  cli-
matologists’ offices, agricultural extensions, State and local govern-
ments, and resource management agencies.

Additionally, Western Governors stated in their 2006 report that
the federal agencies must continue to fund and expand funding for
data collection networks and activities necessary for monitoring, as
Dr.  Mote  mentioned,  assessing  and  predicting  future  water  sup-
plies. To the degree that Title II of the bill would lead to such im-
provements in data management, the Governors certainly believe it
is appropriate and supported.

One  recommendation  that  we  would  make  for  the  bill  is  to
amend  it  to  address  the  need  for  a  National  Climate  Information
Service  in  the  context  of  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Pro-
gram.  A  National  Climate  Service,  as  again,  Dr.  Mote  mentioned,
such  a  Service  would  be  the  focal  point  for  coordination  of  climate
activities across the Federal Government, and could be the organi-
zation  charged  with  such  responsibilities  as  making  sustained  cli-
mate  observations  and  assessments  about  the  state  of  the  climate,
and  providing  climate  outlooks  and  projects,  similar  to  an  early
warning  system.  Additionally,  the  NCIS  could  provide  routine  as-
sessments  of  climate  impacts  and  vulnerabilities,  and  develop  rel-
evant products and services for decision and policy-makers.

The  National  Integrated  Drought  Information  System  that  this
committee  authorized  last  year  would  thus  become  an  important
component  of  a  larger  climate  information  system.  The  Western
states  see  all  of  this  as  very  much  connected.  Decision-makers  at
all levels of government and in the private sector need reliable and

62

timely  information  to  understand  the  possible  impacts  of  the  re-
sponse, and respond to the effects of climate change.

The  Western  Governors  Association  supports  H.R.  906  as  an  ef-
fort  to  move  the  Nation’s  climate  change  research  program  in  this
direction, and I welcome any questions you might have.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Bittleman follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SARAH BITTLEMAN

Chairman Gordon and Members of the Committee, my name is Sarah Bittleman,
and I am the Director of Oregon Governor Theodore Kulongoski’s Washington, D.C.
Office.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Committee  today  regarding  H.R.
906, the Global Climate Change Research Data and Management Act of 2007. I ap-
pear  before  you  on  behalf  of  the  Western  Governor’s  Association  (WGA)—an  inde-
pendent,  nonprofit  organization  representing  the  governors  of  19  Western  States,
American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Through their Associa-
tion,  the  Western  governors  identify  and  address  key  policy  and  governance  issues
in  natural  resources,  the  environment,  human  services,  economic  development,
international relations and public management.

Before  making  specific  comments  about  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Pro-
gram  and  the  legislation  before  you  today,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  sponsors  of
H.R.906,  Representative  Udall  and  Representative  Inglis,  for  both  their  bipartisan
effort on this bill, and their outreach to the Western States in its development.

Last year, WGA worked closely with this Committee on the development and pas-
sage  of  legislation  authorizing  the  National  Integrated  Drought  Information  System
Act of 2006 (NIDIS). There was a high degree of bipartisan cooperation on this Com-
mittee,  and  in  particular  among  the  sponsors  of  the  NIDIS  bill—Mr.  Udall  and
then-Chairman  Hall—and  this  cooperation  undoubtedly  led  to  the  successful  pas-
sage  of  that  bill.  The  Governors  are  very  pleased  to  see  this  spirit  of  cooperation
from the Committee continuing with your efforts on H.R. 906.

Additionally, the Governors want to thank Mr. Udall and Mr. Inglis for their out-
reach  to  the  Western  States  in  soliciting  input  into  the  development  of  H.R.  906.
WGA  appreciates  the  specific  effort  to  make  this  bill  relevant  to,  and  address  the
needs of, the States.

Mr.  Chairman,  with  the  efforts  occurring  in  Oregon  and  many  western  states  to
address  climate  change,  the  Western  Governors  believe  it  is  not  only  appropriate,
but  also  is  necessary  to  reorient  and  fully  fund  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research
Program  to  make  it  more  user-driven.  Since  the  time  the  USGCRP  was  enacted  in
1990,  the  debate  on  climate  change  in  this  country  has  largely  focused  on  whether
the world is warming and whether humans are the cause of that warming. The cur-
rent  science  indicates  that  the  Earth  is  warming  and  that  concentrations  of  atmos-
pheric CO2 have increased significantly. In a 2005 statement, the United States Na-
tional  Academies  of  Science  concluded,  ‘‘the  scientific  understanding  of  climate
change  is  now  sufficiently  clear  to  justify  taking  prompt  action.’’  Eleven  National
Academies  of  Science  from  the  major  nations  of  the  world,  including  the  United
States,  the  United  Kingdom,  Japan,  China,  Russia,  and  others,  have  agreed  that
science  supports  the  fact  that  climate  change  is  occurring,  is  influenced  by  human
activity, and presents risks that should be addressed through changed practices and
preparation for changed conditions.

The  U.S.  has  spent  considerable  dollars  on  understanding  the  science  of  climate
change,  and  we  must  now  look  to  addressing  and  adequately  funding  the  issue  of
adaptation.  The  focus  of  the  USGCRP  research  must  now  move  with  greater  focus
to help states, tribes and local governments understand what that means: How will
climate  change  manifest  itself  in  different  areas  of  the  country?  What  impacts  can
we  expect  at  the  State  and  local  levels?  How  can  we  prepare  for  the  change  in  an
effort to avoid or mitigate the impacts? How can we most effectively implement ad-
aptation measures given that many of them will require a long lead-time?

Impacts  from  warming  that  have  been  projected  for  the  West  include  the  fol-

lowing:

• Smaller snowpacks—winter precipitation could fall as rain instead of snow;
periods  of  snowpack  accumulation  could  be  shorter;  and  snowpacks  could  be
smaller, which has serious implications for reservoir storage.

• Earlier snowmelt—warming earlier in the year could melt snowpacks soon-
er,  further  increasing  the  length  of  time  between  peak  water  flows  and  peak

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

water  demands  from  cities,  farmers,  utilities,  etc.,  requiring  more  reservoir
storage to capture the earlier runoff.

• Rainfall—it is expected that precipitation will come more in the form of rain
than snow, but it is not understood whether overall precipitation will increase
or decrease, or what the temporal and spatial changes of precipitation will be.
• Flood-control releases—water managers may be forced to make changes in

reservoir operations and rule curves.

• More  extreme  flood  events—extreme  events  could  be  more  common,  caus-
ing more frequent and larger floods. In some cases, existing flood control ‘rule
curves’ should be reformulated.

• Floodplain  management—extensive  efforts  will  be  needed  to  better  map
and  define  floodplains,  and  interaction  with  local  governments  will  be  re-
quired to shape the direction of future development in floodplains.

• Receding  glaciers—some  scientists  have  suggested  Glacier  National  Park

could be void of glaciers by 2030 as a result of warming.

• More evaporation and dryness—higher temperatures could increase evap-
oration  from  streams  and  reservoirs,  soil  dryness,  and  the  need  for  supple-
mental water for crops and other plants.

• Less  groundwater—less  availability  of  surface  water  supplies  may  lead  to
increased pumping from groundwater aquifers, further stressing groundwater
supplies and hydraulically connected surface water supplies.

• More  droughts—more  intense,  frequent,  and  longer-lasting  droughts  could

result.

• More  wildfires—there  could  be  an  increase  in  the  number  and  severity  of

wildfires and an extended wildfire season.

• More pests and disease—there could be an increase in the types of disease
and  pests  that  exist  and  proliferate  which  would  adversely  impact  human
public health as well as forest and agriculture health.

• Water  quality  challenges—diminished  streamflows  during  drought  could
result in less dilution of discharges; sediment loading from storm events that
follow  wildfires;  saltwater  intrusion  along  the  coast  resulting  from  rising  sea
levels;  and  warmer  lake  temperatures  leading  to  algae  blooms  could  follow.
• Sea  level  rise—investments  in  infrastructure  to  adapt  to  rising  sea  levels

will be necessary.

• Hydroelectric  generation—climate  changes  that  alter  overall  water  avail-
ability  and  timing  could  reduce  the  productivity  of  hydropower  facilities;
changes  in  the  timing  of  hydroelectric  generation  can  affect  the  value  of  the
energy produced.

• Water-borne  shipping—decreases  in  river  flows  could  reduce  the  periods
when  navigation  is  possible;  increase  transportation  costs;  and  increase  con-
flicts over water allocated for other purposes.

• Ecosystems—natural  ecosystems  and  wildlife  have  limited  ability  to  adapt
or  cope  with  climate  changes  that  occur  over  a  relatively  short  time  frame,
which  could 
impacts,  such  as  additional  species
extinctions.

irreversible 

lead  to 

• Recreation  impacts—due  to  lower  lake  and  stream  flow  levels,  recreation

opportunities and economies could be significantly reduced.

Given the existence of a number of variables, it is not currently possible to predict
or  model  with  any  precision  if,  how  and  when  a  particular  area  within  the  region
may  be  impacted.  More  flexible  institutional  arrangements  are  needed  in  order  to
adapt  to  changing  conditions  related  to  climate  change  and  other  existing  stresses
as well.

It must be recognized that there is already substantial stress on the water sector
today  even  in  the  absence  of  climate  change.  There  are  many  watersheds  that  are
already  fully-appropriated,  and  new  stresses  are  coming  from  population  growth,
land use changes, and water needs for in-stream uses, including those necessary to
meet federal laws such as the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. In
some  areas,  the  new  demands  may  cause  major  shifts  in  water  supply  and  water

64

rights.  Climate  change  may  pose  additional  stresses  and  could  result  in  thresholds
being reached much earlier than currently anticipated.

The  Western  Governors  stated  in  their  2006  report,  Water  Needs  and  Strategies
for  a  Sustainable  Future,  that  Congress  and  the  Administration  should  fund  re-
search  for  improving  the  predictive  capabilities  for  climate  change,  and  assessment
and  mitigation  of  its  impacts.  Additionally,  given  the  complex  climatology  in  the
West,  it  is  important  that  climate  change  modeling  be  conducted  at  a  much  finer
resolution, e.g., watersheds and sub-watersheds. It is also important that the federal
government  implement  research  funding  recommendations  associated  with  Goals  4
and 5 of the 2003 CCSP Strategic Plan, including the area of increased partnerships
with  existing  user  support  institutions,  such  as  State  climatologists  or  climate  cen-
ters, regional climate centers, agricultural extension services, resource management
agencies, and State and local governments.

Consistent  with  their  report,  the  governors  believe  Title  I  of  H.R.  906  would  ap-
propriately  focus  the  research  of  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Research  Program  on  im-
proving  the  understanding  of  global  climate  change,  responding  to  the  information
needs  of  communities  and  decision-makers,  and  providing  periodic  assessments  of
the  vulnerabilities  of  the  U.S.  and  other  regions  to  global  climate  change.  Some
states  are  creating  their  own  climate  change  research  centers,  including  Oregon.  It
is  important  that  the  program  created  under  H.R.  906  integrates  and  supports  the
efforts of State and regional climate research centers.

Additionally,  Western  Governors  stated  in  their  report  that  the  federal  agencies
must  continue  and  expand  funding  for  data  collection  networks  and  activities  nec-
essary for monitoring, assessing, and predicting future water supplies. To the degree
Title  II  of  the  bill  will  lead  to  such  improvements  to  data  management,  the  gov-
ernors believe it is appropriate.

One  recommendation  that  we  would  make  for  the  bill  is  to  amend  it  to  address
the  need  for  a  National  Climate  Information  Service  in  the  context  of  USGCRP.
Such  a  service  could  be  the  focal  point  for  coordination  of  climate  activities  across
the  Federal  Government,  and  could  be  the  organization  charged  with  such  respon-
sibilities as making sustained climate observations and assessments about the state
of  the  climate  and  providing  climate  outlooks  and  projections  (similar  to  an  early
warning  system).  Additionally,  the  NCIS  could  provide  routine  assessments  of  cli-
mate  impacts  and  vulnerabilities  and  develop  relevant  products  and  services  for
decision-  and  policy-makers.  The  National  Integrated  Drought  Information  System
(NIDIS)  that  you  authorized  the  last  year  would  thus  become  an  important  compo-
nent of this larger climate information system.

On  May  4  of  last  year,  the  Western  Governors’  Association  testified  before  your

committee in support of the NIDIS bill stating:

No  systematic  collection  and  analysis  of  social,  environmental  and  economic
data  focused  on  the  impacts  of  drought  within  the  United  States  exists  today.
Understanding  these  impacts  of  drought  will  empower  users  and  expand  the
comprehension  of  the  full  magnitude  of  drought  losses.  By  so  doing,  it  will  en-
courage local, State and federal officials to increase efforts in drought planning,
preparation,  and  mitigation. . ..  The  National  Integrated  Drought  Information
System will allow policy-makers and water managers at all levels of the private
and  public  sectors  to  make  more  informed  and  timely  decisions  about  water  re-
sources in order to mitigate or avoid the impacts from droughts.

These same statements could also be applied to the broader needs of climate data
and research. Decision-makers at all levels of government and in the private sector
need  reliable  and  timely  information  to  understand  the  possible  impacts  and  cor-
responding  vulnerabilities  that  are  posed  by  climate  change  so  they  can  plan  and
respond  accordingly.  The  Western  Governors’  Association  supports  H.R.  906  as  an
effort to move the Nation’s climate change research program in this direction.

DISCUSSION

THE USGCRP BUDGET PROCESS

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Bittleman.  Thank  you,  Members  of

the panel, for your excellent testimony.

At this point, we will open our first round of questions, and I will
recognize  myself  for  five  minutes.  And  I  want  to  start  with  a  con-
stituent, a Coloradan, Dr. Fellows.

As you well know from your experience at the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, in coordinating agency budgets for the USGCRP,
the budget process for interagency programs is always a challenge,
shall  we  say.  Would  you  elaborate  on  your  recommendation  that
the  USGCRP  Interagency  Committee  have  ‘‘a  clear  budget  process
linking tasks to agency and program budgets?’’

Are  you  saying  that  the  Director  of  the  USGCRP  must  have
budget authority over the agencies of the USGCRP? Would the Di-
rector of OSTP, for example, be a good candidate for this function?
Dr.  FELLOWS.  Well,  there  are  a  lot  of  options  here,  you  know,
ranging  from  the  current  one,  where  all  the  agencies  retain  their
budgets,  to  a  completely  centralized  budget  process,  and  I  am  not
sure that either end of the spectrum is the right way to go.

I  do  think  there  is  an  argument  to  be  made  for  the  Director  of
the U.S. Global Change Research Program to be close enough to po-
litical  power  to  have  the  clout  to  make  the  kind  of  decisions  and
tradeoffs  that  you  would  across  an  agency,  and  probably,  to  have
some  level  of  budget  authority  that  he  can  use  to  help  encourage,
or provide incentives for people to make investments in the highest
priority areas of the program.

We used to, when I was in OMB, have an annual budget review
process,  where  we  actually  called  all  the  agencies  in.  They  got  a
chance  to  present  their  programs,  every  relevant  budget  examiner
and  representative  of  OSTP  had  a  chance  to  hear  their  programs,
got to see the links between the programs, and I thought that that
was a pretty effective mechanism to try to make the kind of trade-
offs.  But  we  never  had  the  real  clout  to  actually  be  able  to  say  we
need to move in one particular area. We had to rely on the goodwill
between all the agencies to do that, so I think that budget author-
ity could help the Director.

Mr.  UDALL.  Anyone  else  want  to  comment  on  that  particular
question,  given  Dr.  Fellows’  expertise,  but  others  have  also  faced
this same dilemma?

Dr. MAHONEY. Exactly. Mr. Udall, just a brief comment that per-
haps  it  is  trying  to  think  pragmatically  about  what  might  work.  I
had  somewhat  of  a  hybrid  position,  because  I  was  a  Senate  con-
firmed subcabinet officer, so I had, for better or for worse, political
standing  over  these  recent  years  in  managing  the  program,  and  I
had access to the very top of OMB, OSTP, and exercised those, and
to all of the relevant Cabinet officers frequently enough. Still, what
I recommend is close to what Dr. Fellows has just said, but I would
treat it a little bit differently.

I  think  that  there  should  be  a  definite  recognized  management
and  coordination  function,  because  that  is  where,  as  little  as  it  is,
some  very  important  things  are  done  now  in  the  communications
area,  and  in  getting  all  these  reports  out,  and  they  are  tremen-
dously under-resourced, the people in that office work very hard to
get it done. But it is also a major source of delay, because they are
just overwhelmed.

I  think  if  we  took  that  same  office,  and  I  wouldn’t  want  to  give
any climate program head budget authority over a Cabinet depart-
ment.  I  don’t  think  that  makes  sense.  But  if  that  function  were
placed  in  one  of  the  departments,  but  clearly,  its  role  was  to  be
subject to the review by the others, and it had a very small budget

66

itself in that department, one part for its own manpower, for exam-
ple, which wouldn’t be much, and I actually have in my statement
a recommendation about two other functions, close to what Dr. Fel-
lows  was  talking  about.  One,  that  would  provide  a  small  kitty  of
developmental  and  bright  idea  and  filling  the  gaps  funds  that  it
could  administer  on  a  transfer  basis  or  whatever  else,  and  the
other  one,  to  provide  some  seed  money  for  some  assessment  work.
And  to  my  experience  of  working  in  the  last  several  years  on
this,  anyway,  having  that  capability,  with  an  element  of  budget,
which  would  flow  through  that  department’s  own  budget,  but
which  would  be  clearly  identified  as  funds  to  support  this  pro-
grammatic activity, would be a way to maintain the normal purity
of  the  departments  being  responsible  for  their  own  budgets,  while
having  a  relatively  small  budget  that  could  be,  it  could  reach
around some.

And  that  is  an  area  where  I  would  think  that  some  direction  by
the  Congress  about  its  desire  to  see  a  more  efficient  and  effective
process,  given  the  complexity  of  our  government,  would  be  a  posi-
tive step.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, and I see that my time has expired, and
Doctor, I will come back to you, and I want to, at this point, I want
to  recognize  my  friend  and  coauthor  of  this  legislation,  I  want  to
thank  Congressman  Inglis  again  for  his  joining  me  in  this  impor-
tant endeavor, and Mr. Inglis, you are recognized for five minutes.

ASSESSMENT TIMELINE

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Udall,  and  I  am  interested  in  the
timeline  that,  for  updating  the  ten  year  Global  Change  Research
Plan.  The  bill  calls  for  it  being  updated  every  four  years,  and  I
wonder  if  you  all  might  want  to  comment  on  whether  you  think
that  is  a  sufficient  schedule  for  updates,  or  will  it  become  stale
within  that  four  year  period,  or  do  you  have  any  thoughts  about
that?

Dr.  MACCRACKEN.  Well,  the  first  one  was  developed  in  about
1990,  and  had  a  theme  that  was  very  disciplinary.  It  had  what
were called seven disciplinary areas, so, ecology and things. We ac-
tually  did  develop  an  alternative  approach  in  the  mid-’90s,  to  try
and cut it a different way, to focus on the stratospheric ozone issue,
on  seasonal  to  inter-annual,  on  climate  change,  and  on,  I  think,
land  cover,  and  things.  There  wasn’t  a  formal  plan  put  out,  al-
though  there  was,  in  one  of  these  Our  Changing  Planets  a  set  of
objectives  and  a  whole  bunch  of  sort  of  activities  that  are  not  a
whole lot different than what came out in the plan later.

I  think  it  is  useful  every,  I  am  not  sure  four  years  is  the  right
number,  but  you  do  need  to  sort  of  take  a  different  perspective.
This  is  a  very  complex  issue,  and  there  is  no  optimal  way  to  cut
it into pieces, and so, I think it helps to take different looks at dif-
ferent times, and get different perspectives.

We  wanted  to  do  that  also  on  the  National  Assessment,  come  at
it  not  the  second  time  for  climate  change,  because  in  four  years,
that  wouldn’t  have  changed  so  much,  but  come  at  it,  for  example,
on well, what are all the factors affecting land cover that we have?
Think  about  global  change  very  broadly.  What  are  the  things  that
are  affecting  land  cover?  And  so  that  partly  is  climate  change  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

67

partly  variability,  and  partly  atmospheric  chemistry  changes,  and
a  whole  bunch  of  other  things.  So,  cut  it  differently,  try  and  get
some new insights.

So,  requiring  something  in  an  update,  and  some  re-looking,  I

think, is useful. It can be a hard process, but it is useful.

Mr. INGLIS. And Dr. Fellows.
Dr. FELLOWS. I was just going to mention that the world climate
science  community  every  five  years  takes  a  look,  it  essentially
takes  a  temperature  of  the  new  science  in  the  climate  arena,  so  I
think four or five years is probably pretty reasonable.

In  the  bill,  and  Dr.  Mahoney  touched  on  this,  it  actually  talks
about  a  ten  year  research  plan,  an  annual  plan,  a  vulnerability
plan,  a  policy  plan,  and  they  are  all  due  the  first  year.  It  would
be  interesting  to  actually  look  at  how  that  plan  might  change,  if
you did the vulnerability and the policy assessment first. So, there
is even some sequencing of how you would do these various reports,
but  a  five  year  cycle,  a  four  or  five  year  cycle  is  probably  good  for
the program plan itself.

Mr. INGLIS. Some people might say to us about this bill that you
know,  you  can  collect  information,  but  is  it  going  to  help  us  that
much?  And  I  am  thinking  of  the  mountain  trout,  I  believe  it  is,  in
the  streams  of  North  Carolina  and  a  little  bit  of  South  Carolina,
in  the  mountains.  Apparently,  1  degree  Fahrenheit,  I  believe  it  is,
temperature change, and we have no more trout. It warms up 1 de-
gree, and they are gone from our rivers.

And I guess, the question is: is it helpful to know? I think it does

build awareness. Is that right, Ms. Bittleman?

Ms. BITTLEMAN. Yes, Mr. Inglis, I had wanted to add to this, hav-
ing  the  assessments  reviewed  and  updated,  and  the  scientific  data
reviewed  and  updated  periodically,  whether  it  is  three  years,  four
years,  five  years,  is  all  very  important.  But  from  a  State  perspec-
tive,  I  think  it  is  important  to  realize  that  the  entire  process  of
data collection and adaptation and how climate change is being ex-
perienced on the ground is really, to us, what the important aspect
of this bill is, which is every year, when data is being collected, at
the same time, states like Oregon, and in the Carolinas and Pacific
Northwest,  the  Carolinas,  the  states  are  actually  acting.  We  have
user  groups,  we  have  climate  change  groups,  we  have  scientists,
but  we  also  have  economists  and  businesses  that  are  really  react-
ing  to  and  trying  to  anticipate  how  their  businesses  are  going  to
change.

Salmon  fishery  is  a  very  good  example  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.
We  are  looking  at  salmon  populations  all  the  time,  in  conjunction
with NOAA, and the question is, you know, is climate change going
to—what  are  the  long-term  effects  of  climate  change,  and  how  are
we,  as  an  industry,  the  salmon  industry,  how  are  they  going  to
react to that? How can we help them react to that?

So,  while—I  just  would  hope  that  you  don’t,  you  know,  when
there is a year date for a report, I don’t think that is as important
as the flexibility needed to incorporate all this, all the information,
science data, but also, activities that are happening on the ground,
including  what  is  happening  in  the  states,  and  how  the  states  are
responding.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you. My time has expired.

REGIONAL VS. NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS

Mr. UDALL. Thank the gentleman. We will come back around for
a second round, if you all can stay. I recognize myself again for five
minutes, and I want to start with Ms. Bittleman, but I would alert
the panel that I would like you all to think about weighing in once
she has had a chance to answer.

And  I  want  to  just  talk  about  this  regional  versus  national  as-
sessments  dynamic  that  we  have.  We  certainly  need  regional  as-
sessments  and  regional  responses,  but  each  individual  region
doesn’t  stand  on  its  own.  You  get  impacts,  consequences  in  other
areas. And for this reason, we need also national assessments.

Would you agree, and if so, how do we ensure that the USGCRP

will serve both of these information needs?

Ms.  BITTLEMAN.  Well,  since  I  am  here  representing  a  region,  I
am  going  to  fall  on  the  side  of  preferring  a  regional  approach,  but
I  think  you  are  absolutely  right.  We  do  need  national  information
and a national approach.

Again,  I  don’t  see  these  things  as  actually  separate.  In  Oregon,
and in the Pacific Northwest, we would like to collect climate infor-
mation  on  a  watershed  and  sub-watershed  level.  That  is  a  much
more  specific  level  than  a  region,  than  a  state  or  a  region,  and  so,
what  we  would  like  to  see  is  all  of  this  information  integrated.  So,
from  a  sub-watershed  to  watershed  to  State  to  region  to  national
level,  and  we  see  the  possibility  of  integration  as  the  real  hope
here.

THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY’S PERSPECTIVE

Mr.  UDALL.  Anyone  else  like  to  respond?  Mr.  Nutter.  And  Mr.
Nutter, by the way, it is always great to have you as part of these
hearings,  because  you  bring  the  economic  implications  of  much  of
this to the fore, which is crucial to consider, and it is, in fact, why
a lot of us have moved, a lot of communities, a lot of industries are
moving in the direction. Let us respond now. We have time.

Mr. NUTTER. Well, thank you for the question and the comment.
From  the  insurance  perspective,  regional  assessments  are  prob-
ably  imperative.  There  is  not  much  point  in  looking  at  a  national
assessment  without  understanding  the  subcategories  of  all  that.
The effect of climate change on extreme weather events in the Gulf
is  different  than  it  is  for  a  State  like  Florida,  or  East  Coast  or
upper  East  Coast.  The  same  would  be  true,  the  same  comment
would  be  true  if  you  are  looking  at  the  effect  of  extreme  weather
events in the Midwest, the tornados and other extreme events.

So, from our perspective, the regionalization of the assessment is,

frankly, the most valuable part.

Mr. UDALL. Very good point. Very useful. Dr. MacCracken.

MORE ON REGIONAL VS. NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS

Dr.  MACCRACKEN.  I  think  that  is  also  a  very  good  question.  We
tried, because there are a number of issues that cut across, to have
sector  assessments  do  that,  so  you  wanted  to  crosscut  with  that.
And  so,  if  you  are  interested  in  how  the  forests  are  going  to  do,
health-wise,  locally,  you  want  to  have  a  regional  one.  If  you  want
to  understand  the  market  for  forest  products,  you  have  to  look

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

69

more  broadly,  certainly  across  the  country.  Or  if  you  want  to  look
at agriculture, you can look at what happens to a farmer in a par-
ticular place, or you can look at food production more broadly.

So, I think you need both regions, you need sectors, and the area
that we didn’t get to at all in what we were, realized needed to get
done,  was  how  what  happens  elsewhere  in  the  world  affects  what
happens here, so that can be everything on natural factors, like mi-
gratory species, to what happens with our investments. When there
was  a  drought  in  Indonesia  several  years  ago,  there  were  layoffs
on  Wall  Street.  I  mean,  the  world  is  interconnected  with  invest-
ments.  It  is  certainly  interconnected  with  respect  to  health,  and  it
is  certainly  interconnected  with  respect  to  environmental  refugees.
IPCC  looks  at  some  of  these,  but  it  sort  of  does  the  chapters  a
little  bit  separately,  and  hasn’t  looked  at  how  one  set  of  countries
depends  on  another,  and  the  various  economic  connections.  So,
there are a lot of different cuts that have to be taken, and together,
that  is  how  you  draw  forth  the  findings  for  a  national  level  report
that would be meaningful to Members of Congress.

Mr.  UDALL.  There  is  an  interesting  school  of  thought  out  there
when  it  comes  to  this  challenge  we  face  of  responding  to  global
change,  and  we  are  having  that  discussion  today,  or  climate
change,  or  both.  If  we  would  figure—I  should  say  when  we  figure
this one out, as the human race, that we will actually create a tem-
plate  to  deal  with  a  lot  of  other  challenges  and  opportunities  and
problems that we face across the globe.

And  that  keeps  me  going  every  day,  given  the  size  of  this,  and

the complexity of what we face.

Dr. MACCRACKEN. The report that we did, that this UN panel re-
cently  did  for  the  Commission  on  Sustainable  Development,  tried
to  very  much  make  that  point,  that  climate  change  is  intimately
tied  to  meeting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and  if  you
don’t  think  about  climate  change  in  the  context,  you  are  not  going
to  be  able  to  ensure  meeting  the  water  needs  and  the  other  kinds
of  things  in  particular  regions,  or  severe  weather,  or  other  kinds
of things. So, it is, indeed, all coupled, and has to be done that way,
looked at that way.

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION

Mr.  UDALL.  I  know  my  time  has  expired,  but  Mr.  Inglis  and  I
have reached an agreement. I think he has asked the questions he
would  like  to  ask.  I  am  going  to  go  for  a  few  more  minutes,  and
then,  we  will  begin  to  bring  the  hearing  to  a  close,  but  I  did  want
to  turn  back  to  Mr.  Nutter,  if  I  might,  for  a  minute,  and  ask  you
a  question  about  the  large  population  growth  in  high  risk  areas
that has exacerbated the impacts of climate change.

Would you comment on how H.R. 906 might provide information

to reduce the vulnerability of these already overstressed areas?

Mr. NUTTER. Thank you for the question.
To  the  extent  that  the  assessments  can  help  not  just  our  indus-
try,  the  insurance  industry,  but  those  who  regulate  our  industry,
and  those  who  look  at  protecting  people’s  property  and  lives
through building codes or other hazard mitigation, we will all learn
from  the  information  about  increased  frequency  or  severity  of
storms,  and  other  research  products  from  this  program.  It  would

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:23 Feb 22, 2008 Jkt 034910 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\050307\34910 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

have enormous public benefit, and obviously, the private benefit to
all of us who are engaged in risk assessment or risk mitigation.

So,  I  see  it  as  a  valuable  product,  as  we  try  to  understand  the
dynamics  of  a  changing  climate.  My  recollection  is  that  53  percent
of  the  U.S.  population  lives  within  50  miles  of  a  coast.  That  is  a
pretty remarkable exposed population. The State of Florida has $2
trillion of insured properties. The State of New York has $2 trillion
of insured properties. My recollection, Mr. Inglis, is that your state
has something like $150 billion of insured properties.

It  is  a  remarkable  exposure,  and  our  ability  to  deal  with  the  fi-
nancing  of  recovery  from  extreme  events,  and  understand  the  dy-
namics,  so  we  can  protect  property  and  life  from  that  would  be  a
byproduct of this legislation.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you  for  that  response.  Dr.  MacCracken,  I
would  turn  back  to  you  briefly.  You  recommend  keeping  research
on  climate  change  science  separate  from  that  on  energy  tech-
nologies. I assume you are referring to technology development and
research.  At  some  point,  however,  shouldn’t  we  evaluate  new  en-
ergy technologies, their potential deployment schedules, their costs,
and  their  missions  profiles,  to  see  how  they  will  impact  atmos-
pheric  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases?  And  in  general,  where
should  this  analysis  of  issues  that  intersect  the  science  and  tech-
nology development occur? Easy question, I know.

Dr.  MACCRACKEN.  You  know,  I  was,  in  my  comment,  just  trying
to  keep  the,  to  make  sure  that  the  research  that  goes  on  about
what  is  going  to  happen,  and  the  decisions  about  what  technology
research you fund, are not so closely intermixed that they bias each
other,  that  you  say,  well,  I  mean,  I  think  the  fear  was  in  some  of
the 1990s, that people will use climate change to justify funding fu-
sion  research  or  something,  and  we  really  wanted  to  pursue  those
kinds of things separately. Certainly, you have to look at what the,
what  will  happen,  in  terms  of  technology,  and  in  fact,  if  I  can  just
go back to comments that Ms. Bittleman and Phil made, when they
called  for  a  National  Climate  Information  Service,  that  is  abso-
lutely  vital,  but  there  are  some  other  things  we  need  as  well,  to
project  into  the  future  that  we  struggle  with,  and  that  includes
what is going to happen to the Nation’s ecosystems, sort of the land
cover projection, what is going to happen in terms of demographics
and in economics and technology.

One  of  the  things  we  struggled  with,  in  trying  to  put  together  a
useful assessment, was to project well, what is really going to hap-
pen?  Are  there  things  around  the  corner  that  are  going  to  mean
that  this  isn’t  the  problem?  How  are  we  going  to  adapt  to  it?  And
one  needs  to  have  some  sort  of  perhaps  central  facility  to  make
that  happen,  or  central,  maybe  it  is  a  virtual  program,  or  some
place where it comes together, but it can’t just be Climate Informa-
tion  Service,  because  as  soon  as  you  say,  well,  I  have  got  the  Cli-
mate  Information  Service,  then  people  are  going  to  ask:  ‘‘Well,
what  is  happening  with  economic  development?’’  Or  ‘‘what  is  hap-
pening with demographics and population?’’ And ‘‘where are people
choosing to live?’’ and all these other issues. And that whole social
science  part  of  what  needs  to  be  in  global  change  isn’t  really  well-
funded  and  doesn’t  even  have  much  of  a  constituency  or  capability
for it.

Mr. UDALL. Dr. Mote, I am going to move to you now, if I could.
Dr. MOTE. Sure.
Mr.  UDALL.  And—if  I  could  ask—you  want  to  comment  on  that,

and then, I will ask you a question?

Dr.  MOTE.  Yeah,  let  me  just  comment  on  the—another  aspect  of
this sort of separation that Dr. MacCracken talked about is in some
instances,  mitigating  and  adapting  to  climate  change  do  come  to-
gether.  For  example,  evaluating  the  resilience  of  hydropower  to  a
changing  climate,  or  wind  power.  So,  as  we  design  portfolios  of  fu-
ture energy, are those portfolios themselves resistant to or resilient
to the kinds of changes that may come down in the future.

Mr.  UDALL.  That  is  a  very,  very  good  point.  Some  cases,  it  may
work  to  power  needs  benefits,  in  other  cases,  it  may  actually  work
the other way. Hydropower——

Dr. MOTE. Yeah, in the Pacific Northwest is having——
Mr. UDALL. Hydropower——
Dr.  MOTE.—warming  climates  actually  helps  our  hydropower
production, because it puts availability of supply more in sync with
regional demand. It sort of leaves California in a more difficult po-
sition, because then, we don’t have spare power to sell in the sum-
mer, but——

Mr.  UDALL.  I  am  going  to  not  be  tempted  to  comment  on  that,
as a Coloradan, but let me turn to RISA for a minute, and you dis-
cussed  it  as  an  example  of  a  stakeholder-driven  climate  sciences
venture.  How  could  the  climate  program  be  tailored  to  build  upon
the work being done by RISA?

Dr.  MOTE.  Well,  the  key  success  of  the  RISA  program  has  been
putting top level scientists directly in touch with top level decision-
makers  on  the  regional,  State,  and  local  scale.  And  you  know,  to
some  extent,  that  happens  nationally,  but  these  are  partnerships
that  lead  to  better  science,  because  the  science  is  then  driven  by
a  genuine  societal  need,  and  it  also  leads  to  better  management,
because  the  decision-makers  are  slowly  learning  more  about  cli-
mate.

Again,  it  is  not  just  about  future  climate  change,  but  the  pat-
terns  of  variability  that  we  already  experience,  paleoclimate,  you
know, evaluating how robust is the Colorado River Compact, given
the  400  year  perspective  that  we  get  from  tree  rings,  things  like
that.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you. You had to bring the Colorado River into

Dr. MOTE. I drew my first breath 42 years ago today in the high

mountain air of Colorado, so——

Mr. UDALL. Today is your birthday?
Dr. MOTE. Yes.
Mr. UDALL. Well, happy birthday. Well, maybe we should——
Dr. MOTE. Thank you.
Mr.  UDALL.  Well,  I  think  that  is  a  great  place  to  stop  at  this

this.

point.

I  did  want  to  yield  to  Mr.  Inglis  for  a  couple  of  concluding  re-

marks, and then, we will bring the hearing to a close.

Mr.  INGLIS.  So,  I  am  going  to  sing.  I  will  spare  you,  but  happy
birthday. And I thank Mr. Udall for chairing this part of the hear-
ing,  and  appreciate  his  work  on  this,  and  it  has  been  very  helpful

for me to hear your comments, so thank you for the education you
have afforded us today.

Mr. UDALL. Well, let me conclude by thanking you all for appear-
ing  before  the  Subcommittee.  It  is  clear,  I  hope,  to  all  of  you,  and
those listening, and those participating today, that I take the chal-
lenge,  as  does  Congressman  Inglis,  and  many  of  us  here  in  the
House,  of  addressing  global  warming,  very  seriously,  and  it  is  one
of our highest priorities in the Congress.

Your testimony, as we have said, has been very helpful, and I be-
lieve  that  this  legislation  will  take  an  important  step  forward  in
providing  planners  with  the  tools  they  need  to  combat  climate
change.

Under  the  rules  of  the  Committee,  the  record  will  be  held  open
for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements  and
any additional questions they might have for the witnesses.

At this time, the hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:52 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
