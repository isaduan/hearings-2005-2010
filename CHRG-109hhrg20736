HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

NASA Earth Science

THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Thursday, April 28, at 10:00am, the Committee on Science will hold a hearing
to  examine  the  state  of  Earth  science  programs  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and
Space Administration (NASA).

NASA  proposes  to  spend  about  $1.37  billion  on  Earth  science  research  in  Fiscal
Year  (FY)  2006,  a  cut  of  about  $120  million,  or  eight  percent,  from  FY  2005  (or
about $180 million, or 12 percent, below the FY04 request).

In a report to be released this week, the National Academy of Sciences concludes
that the budget cutbacks threaten the vitality of NASA’s Earth science research, as
many Earth science missions have been downsized, delayed or canceled. The report
is part of the ‘‘Decadal Survey’’ being conducted by the Academy at NASA’s request
to  help  the  Agency  set  priorities  in  the  Earth  sciences.  The  final  report  is  due  in
late 2006.

The  primary  activities  of  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  are  to  develop  and
launch  research  satellites  designed  to  improve  understanding  of  the  land,  oceans
and atmosphere. In the past, NASA missions have helped gain new knowledge and
create  new  capabilities  that  have  led  to  advances  in  weather  forecasting,  storm
warnings,  and  the  ability  to  more  efficiently  manage  agricultural  and  natural  re-
sources.

But the National Academy of Sciences report warns that U.S. leadership in devel-
oping  such  capabilities  is  threatened  by  the  drop  in  support  for  NASA’s  Earth
science  research.  Because  at  the  time  of  this  writing  the  report  has  yet  to  be  re-
leased, NASA has not issued a response.

NASA’s  new  Administrator,  Michael  Griffin,  in  his  public  statements  has  ex-

pressed general support for Earth science at NASA.
Overarching Questions

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1. What  is  NASA’s  long-term  strategic  vision  for  conducting  Earth  science  ob-

servations from space? How does the current budget reflect that vision?

2. What are or what should be the top priority missions for Earth science? How

would these priorities benefit society?

3. What are the implications of NASA’s recent actions to cancel or reduce fund-
ing  for  several  Earth  science  missions?  How  would  the  proposed  cuts  affect
interagency  programs  such  as  those  on  climate  science  and  Earth  observa-
tions?

Background
Recent Developments: National Academy Report

At NASA’s request, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Earth
Science  Applications  from  Space  is  currently  conducting  a  ‘‘Decadal  Survey’’  for
Earth  science  observations  from  space.  Similar  to  the  decadal  surveys  conducted
with  great  success  in  astronomy  and  the  planetary  sciences,  the  Earth  science
decadal survey is expected to establish a prioritized list of research projects that the
entire  Earth  sciences  community  agrees  should  be  funded  for  the  next  ten  years.
This will be the first time a decadal survey has been conducted for Earth science.
It is a challenging undertaking because the field is broader and deals with more fed-
eral  agencies  than  astronomy  does.  The  NAS  Committee  Chair,  Dr.  Berrien  Moore,
will be testifying at the hearing.

The NAS Committee this week is releasing an interim report titled ‘‘Earth Science
and Applications from Space: Urgent Needs and Opportunities to Serve the Nation.’’
The report states that ‘‘recent changes in federal support for Earth observation pro-
grams are alarming.’’ The report’s Executive Summary states:

At  NASA,  the  vitality  of  Earth  science  and  application  programs  has  been
placed at substantial risk by a rapidly shrinking budget that no longer supports
already  approved  missions  and  programs  of  high  scientific  and  societal  rel-
evance.  Opportunities  to  discover  new  knowledge  about  the  Earth  are  dimin-
ished  as  mission  after  mission  is  canceled,  de-scoped,  or  delayed,  because  of
budget  cutbacks,  which  appear  to  be  largely  the  result  of  new  obligations  to
support  flight  programs  that  are  part  of  the  Administration’s  vision  for  space
exploration.

The  NAS  Committee  specifically  recommends  that  NASA  launch  on  schedule  two
Earth  science  missions  that  have  been  threatened  with  delays  or  cancellations.  It
also  recommends  that  NASA  request  brief  studies  of  its  plans  for  three  other  mis-
sions. NASA has said that those missions could be launched on board the NPOESS
satellite  rather  than  as  independent  missions.  (NPOESS  stands  for  National  Polar-
orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System  and  is  being  launched  by  the
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  and  the  Department  of
Defense.)  Finally,  the  NAS  Committee  recommends  that  NASA  ‘‘re-invigorate’’  sev-
eral  smaller  Earth  science  programs.  (The  Executive  Summary  of  the  NAS  report
is attached, and more information on specific missions is included below.)
Earth Sciences

NASA’s  mission  statement  begins  with  the  goal,  ‘‘To  understand  and  protect  our
home  planet.’’  NASA  research  in  Earth  science  has  thus  focused  on  understanding
how the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land interact and operate as a whole, with
an eye toward direct societal applications.

Within  the  Earth  sciences  program,  one  of  NASA’s  primary  roles  is  to  build  and
launch  research  satellites  to  provide  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  basic  processes
governing  the  Earth’s  physical  system.  Capabilities  and  discoveries  from  NASA’s
program  are  often  later  incorporated  by  other  agencies  into  the  satellites  they  use
in  their  ongoing  operational  programs,  such  as  weather  or  geographic  imaging  sat-
ellites.

One example of how the NASA program works and contributes to operational pro-
grams  is  its  Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission  (TRMM),  which  NASA  launched
in 1997 and is now scheduled to end operations this summer. TRMM provides data
that  was  never  before  available  on  tropical  precipitation  patterns  to  help  scientists
study  the  water  cycle  and  related  issues  including  climate  change.  But  unexpect-
edly, TRMM has also given researchers new insights into determining the track and
intensity  of  hurricanes,  which  could  contribute  to  future  efforts  to  predict  the  land-
fall  of  hurricanes,  which  is  the  responsibility  of  NOAA.  NOAA  could  place  instru-
ments based on TRMM on future weather satellites.

The Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), the planned follow-on mission to TRMM,
would  continue  to  provide  further  improvements  in  the  observation  of  rainfall  by,
among  other  things,  expanding  rainfall  information  to  the  entire  globe.  NASA  has
delayed the launch of GPM several times. (See below.)

In  another  example,  NASA  researchers  are  also  exploring  whether  data  from
Earth observing satellites can be used to track ocean pollution from runoff. (See at-
tached article from Space News).

NASA satellites have made substantial contribution to a variety of areas, such as
documenting the existence of a hole in the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. Fu-
ture  NASA  missions  could  potentially  provide  useful  information  for  a  number  of
important  societal  needs.  For  example,  interferometric  synthetic  aperture  radar
(InSAR)  technology  that  some  scientists  have  suggested  for  a  future  NASA  mission
could  be  able  to  detect  small  changes  in  surface  of  Earth  to  presage  volcanic  erup-
tions or landslides. Also, NASA’s Glory mission, which has recently been downscaled
(see  below),  was  developed  to  help  resolve  one  of  the  largest  uncertainties  in  sci-
entists’  understanding  of  climate  change,  the  effects  of  the  variable  output  of  the
sun and of atmospheric aerosols (black soot and carbon).

NASA’s  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (MD),  Jet  Propulsion  Lab  (CA),  and  Ames
Research  Center  (CA)  each  contribute  substantially  to  Earth  sciences  research  at
NASA.
NASA Earth Sciences Budget

Funding  for  the  Earth  sciences  has  declined  each  year  since  FY  2004,  and  the
President’s  FY  2006  budget  submission  continues  this  reduction.  The  table  below
compares  the  last  three  budget  requests  (including  the  accompanying  run-out  for
the four following years) for NASA’s Earth science programs:

The budget for the Earth sciences programs at NASA was cut sharply in FY 2005,
with  reductions  in  the  run-out  for  the  years  2005–2009  totaling  over  $1  billion  as
compared  to  the  planned  budget  for  these  years  at  the  time  of  the  FY  2004  budget
submission. The FY 2006 budget request reduces this amount slightly further.

In  the  FY  2006  budget  request,  NASA  has  made  it  difficult  to  determine  Earth
science  funding  by  consolidating  the  Earth  science  programs  and  several  space
science  programs  into  a  new  ‘‘Earth-Sun  System’’  theme  within  the  new  Science
Mission Directorate. (Earth sciences had previously been a separate directorate from
space  sciences.  The  Science  Committee  was  able  to  get  the  Earth  science  figures
only  after  repeated  requests.)  The  Earth-Sun  theme  also  includes  the  ‘‘Sun-Earth
Connections’’ programs, such as the Voyager mission, which continues to send back
data from the outer limits of the solar system. The funding table above includes only
funding for Earth sciences. For information regarding funding for the entire Earth-
Sun System theme as a whole see Appendix B.
Effect of Budget Reductions

The  budget  reductions  have  led  NASA  to  delay,  cancel  or  scale  back  most  Earth
science  missions.  Furthermore,  NASA  has  few  if  any  additional  Earth  science  mis-
sions in the planning pipeline beyond the missions that have been in the works for
years.  Also,  NASA  does  not  appear  to  have  sufficient  funds  to  launch  some  of  the
missions that it describes as being on schedule.

For example, the NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite, which
is  to  be  coordinated  with  launches  of  related  satellites  by  other  nations,  was  first
scheduled to be launched in 2007. Currently, launching in 2010 would be considered
‘‘on schedule.’’ In its FY 2005 budget request, NASA delayed the launch until 2012.
In  the  FY  2006  request,  the  date  has  been  shifted  back  to  2010,  but  it  is  unclear
whether NASA has requested sufficient funding to make that date.

The  NAS  Committee  interim  report  recommends  that  the  GPM  mission  be
launched without further delays, citing its international nature and the importance
of understanding ‘‘the availability of fresh water.’’

Another  mission  affected  by  the  budget  cutbacks  is  Glory,  which  is  designed  to
study  one  of  the  highest  priority  questions  in  climate  change  science.  Glory  was
originally  intended  to  fly  as  a  stand-alone  mission  in  2008.  But  in  2005,  NASA
began  talking  instead  about  just  building  the  instruments  for  Glory  and  then  look-
ing  to  see  if  they  could  be  launched  on  another  satellite,  such  as  NPOESS.  NASA
has  not  been  able  to  say  when  or  even  if  Glory  would  be  able  to  be  launched  if  it

‘‘piggy-backed’’ on another mission. Under pressure from the Science Committee and
the  House  Appropriations  Committee,  NASA  has  extended  the  contract  to  build  a
launch  vehicle  for  an  independent  Glory  mission,  but  the  future  of  the  mission  is
still in doubt.

The NAS Committee interim report recommends that NASA commission an inde-
pendent  review  to  determine  the  ‘‘suitability,  capability  and  timeliness’’  of  placing
the Glory instruments on another satellite.

The  table  below  summarizes  the  status  of  all  of  NASA’s  currently  planned  large

Earth science missions:

In addition to reducing funding for specific large missions, NASA has sharply re-
duced  the  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinders  (ESSP),  a  research  program  to  launch
small,  experimental  satellites  that  can  test  ideas  for  future  larger  missions.  ESSP
missions  are  not  allowed  to  cost  more  than  about  $230  million  over  the  life  of  the
mission  (as  opposed  to  close  to  $1  billion  for  GPM).  NASA  now  plans  to  delay  for
a year the ESSP proposal solicitation that was scheduled for this summer. The NAS
Committee  interim  report  calls  for  NASA  to  go  forward  with  the  solicitation  this
summer.

(ESSP launches approved from previous solicitations are on schedule. Two should

launch this year.)

NASA has also substantially cut its Earth science research and analysis program,
which  focuses  on  developing  the  tools  and  techniques  to  interpret  Earth  science
data. The program also helps scientists determine how to prioritize potential future
research  missions.  These  cuts  particularly  affect  graduate  student  funding.  Accord-
ing  to  the  NAS  Committee  interim  report,  the  research  and  analysis  programs  at
NASA have suffered disproportionately large cuts.

The  NAS  Committee  interim  report  also  notes  that  the  Earth  science  reductions
could  jeopardize  NASA’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  obligations  to  interagency  initiatives,
such as the development of a Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS).
This  international  effort  will  develop  a  comprehensive  and  coordinated  Earth  ob-
serving  system.  Earlier  this  year,  Secretary  of  Commerce  Carlos  Gutierrez  rep-
resented  the  United  States  at  the  meeting  in  Brussels  where  the  GEOSS  plan  was
adopted.

The NAS Committee interim report also calls into question NASA’s ability to ful-
fill its commitments to the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). NASA’s Earth
Science  program  represents  the  largest  portion  of  the  CCSP  budget,  (62  percent  in
the President’s FY 2006 budget request).

Questions for the Witnesses

The  witnesses  were  asked  to  address  the  following  questions  in  their  testimony:

Questions for Alphonso Diaz

Please  briefly  explain  the  President’s  FY06  budget  request  for  NASA  Earth

sciences and answer the following questions:

• What  missions  that  were  in  the  planning  process  as  of  the  FY  2004  budget
submission  have  been  delayed,  canceled  or  reformulated?  What  criteria  have
NASA  used  in  determining  which  missions  to  delay,  cancel  or  reformulate?
How do these criteria relate to NASA’s larger vision for its Earth science pro-
grams?

• Given  the  FY06  budget  run-out,  to  what  extent  will  NASA  have  to  limit  its
contributions  to  multiple  agency  programs  such  as  the  Climate  Change
Science  Program  (CCSP)  and  the  Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems
(GEOSS)?

Questions for Dr. Berrien Moore

Please summarize the NRC report, and answer the following questions:

Chairman BOEHLERT. Good morning. The Committee will come to

order.

It  is  a  pleasure  to  welcome  everyone  here  this  morning  for  our
hearing  on  one  of  NASA’s  primary  mission  areas:  the  Earth
sciences.

We are very pleased that NASA’s new Administrator, Mike Grif-
fin,  has  very  clearly  and  unequivocally  reinforced  NASA’s  commit-
ment to Earth science. For example, both Senator Allen, during the
confirmation  process,  and  this  is  a  direct  quote,  ‘‘There  are  activi-
ties,  including  Earth  sciences  research,  which  have  little  in  com-
mon  with  the  needs  of  exploration  and  with  which  NASA  has  had
a  long-term  involvement.  Thus,  NASA  has  certain  responsibilities
in these areas, which cannot and should not be set aside. And I am
committed  to  continuing  exploration  of  the  Earth’s  environment  at
NASA.’’  And  that  is  the  end  of  the  quote  from  Administrator  Grif-
fin in the Senate confirmation hearing.

Unfortunately, NASA’s prepared testimony for today’s hearing is
more  problematic.  The  testimony  describes  Earth  science  research
as  being  significant  to  the  extent  that  it  informs  our  knowledge  of
and  our  capability  to  explore  other  planets.  This  is  precisely  back-
wards. The planet that has to matter most to us is the one we live
on.  You  would  think  that  would  go  without  saying.  And  we  are
woefully  ignorant  of  the  way  this  planet  works,  of  the  functioning
of the land, the oceans, and the atmosphere and how they interact.
It is great if Earth science can contribute to exploration and great-
er still if exploration of other planets could teach us more about the
planet Earth.

But  the  Earth  science  program  doesn’t  exist  as  some  secondary
adjunct of the exploration program. It exists to help us understand
the  planet  we  depend  on,  and  there  is  no  reason  that  NASA  can’t
robustly  carry  out  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
while conducting vital Earth science research. In fact, that is what
NASA has to do.

That  is  why  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences’  report  that  was
released  just  yesterday  is  so  alarming.  The  report  indicates  that
NASA  may  be  allowing  its  Earth  Science  Program  to  erode,  per-
haps  irretrievably,  just  as  we  are  beginning  to  understand  more
about  the  Earth’s  processes,  just  as  our  technology  offers  unprece-
dented  opportunities,  just  as  the  Administration  has  announced
new international commitments to Earth observation.

This  report  has  to  be  a  red  flag  for  all  of  us.  We  need  to  stop,
examine  what  is  happening,  and  make  sure  that  the  fiscal  year
2006 budget for NASA, whatever its top-level number, include ade-
quate  funding  to  keep  Earth  science  moving  forward  for  the  fore-
seeable future. We need a vision for Earth science and priorities for
Earth science just as we need to do more for exploration and aero-
nautics.

Yesterday,  I  heard,  for  the  first  time,  a  rationale  from  Dr.  Diaz
for  the  proposed  cuts  in  Earth  science,  and  I  have  to  say,  I  found
it  a  little  bit  troubling  rather  than  convincing.  He  argued  that
some of NASA’s projects could be launched on NOAA satellites and
that  some  other  aspects  of  Earth  science  could  migrate  to  NOAA.
Now we all want NASA and NOAA to work together even better.
In  fact,  we  plan  to  hold  a  hearing  in  the  next  couple  of  months

bringing  the  two  agencies  together  to  look  in  more  detail  at  their
relationship. But having NASA claim that NOAA will take over ac-
tivities when there is no indication of that in NOAA’s plan or budg-
et strains. It is a sound of one hand clapping, and it won’t get any
applause from us.

NASA  has  long  been  the  lead  agency  for  space-based  Earth
science  research.  NOAA  has  operational  responsibilities.  The  two
agencies  have  complementary  missions,  and  the  more  they  can  co-
operate, the better. But one agency cannot substitute for the other,
and  no  agency  can  build,  launch,  or  use  data  from  satellites  with-
out money.

Mr.  Diaz  told  us  yesterday  he  had  no  visibility  into  NOAA’s
budget.  You  would  think  a  window  into  a  partner  agency’s  budget
would  be  a  prerequisite  for  transferring  responsibilities.  If  NASA
has  plans  to  rely  more  on  NOAA,  those  plans  ought  to  be  shared
and  reviewed  with  us  and  with  the  scientific  community.  Just  set-
ting  the  notion  of  relying  on  NOAA  as  an  after-the-fact  budget  ra-
tionalization, I think, is playing with fire.

We  have  before  us  today  the  experts  with  whom  we  can  begin  a
thoughtful,  detailed,  and  realistic  discussion  about  what  NASA
needs  to  do  to  ensure  that  we  have  a  healthy  national  Earth
science  program.  I  can’t  think  of  anything  more  vital  to  our  sur-
vival on the planet that is most important to us, the planet Earth.

Mr. Gordon.

It’s  a  pleasure  to  welcome  everyone  here  this  morning  for  our  hearing  on  one  of
NASA’s  primary  mission  areas—the  Earth  sciences.  I’m  very  pleased  that  NASA’s
new  Administrator,  Mike  Griffin,  has  very  clearly  and  unequivocally  reinforced
NASA’s commitment to Earth science.

For  example,  he  told  Senator  Allen  during  the  confirmation  process,  ‘‘[T]here  are
activities,  including  Earth  Sciences. . .research,  which  have  little  in  common  with
needs  of  Exploration,  and  with  which  NASA  had  had  a  long-term  involvement.
Thus, NASA has certain responsibilities in these areas which cannot and should not
be  set  aside.’’  And  Dr.  Griffin  told  Senator  Dorgan,  ‘‘Earth  science  continues  to  be
vitally important and I am committed to continuing exploration of the Earth’s envi-
ronment at NASA.’’

Unfortunately,  NASA’s  prepared  testimony  for  today’s  hearing  is  more  problem-
atic.  The  testimony  describes  Earth  science  research  as  being  significant  to  the  ex-
tent  that  it  informs  our  knowledge  of,  and  our  capability  to  explore  other  planets.
This  is  precisely  backwards.  The  planet  that  has  to  matter  most  to  us  is  the  one
we live on. You’d think that would go without saying. And we are woefully ignorant
of the way this planet works—of the functioning of the land, oceans and atmosphere
and how they interact.

It’s great if Earth science can contribute to exploration, and greater still if explo-

ration of other planets could teach us more about the Earth.

But the Earth science program doesn’t exist as some secondary adjunct of the ex-

tunities, just as the Administration has announced new international commitments

the  foreseeable  future.  We  need  a  vision  for  Earth  science,  and  priorities  for  Earth
science, just as much as we do for exploration and aeronautics.

Yesterday,  I  heard  for  the  first  time  a  rationale  from  Mr.  Diaz  for  the  proposed
cuts in Earth science. And I have to say I found it more troubling than convincing.
He argued that some NASA projects could be launched on NOAA satellites and that
some other aspects of Earth science could migrate to NOAA.

Now we all want NASA and NOAA to work together even better. In fact, we plan
to  hold  a  hearing  in  the  next  couple  of  months  bringing  the  two  agencies  together
to look in more detail at their relationship. But having NASA claim that NOAA will
take  over  activities  when  there  is  no  indication  of  that  in  NOAA’s  plans  or  budget
strains credulity. It’s the sound of one hand clapping, and it won’t get any applause
from us.

NASA  has  long  been  the  lead  agency  for  space-based  Earth  science  research.
NOAA  has  operational  responsibilities.  The  two  agencies  have  complementary  mis-
sions, and the more they can cooperate the better. But one agency cannot substitute
for  the  other,  and  no  agency  can  build,  launch  or  use  data  from  satellites  without

Mr. Diaz told us yesterday he had ‘‘no visibility’’ into NOAA’s budget. You’d think
a  window  into  a  partner  agency’s  budget  would  be  a  prerequisite  for  transferring
responsibilities.  If  NASA  has  plans  to  rely  more  on  NOAA,  those  plans  ought  to  be
shared and reviewed with us and with the scientific community.

Just citing the notion of relying on NOAA as an after-the-fact budget rationaliza-

tion is playing with fire.

We  have  before  us  today  the  experts  with  whom  we  can  begin  a  thoughtful,  de-
tailed and realistic discussion about what NASA needs to do to ensure that we have
a  healthy,  national  Earth  science  program.  I  can’t  think  of  anything  more  vital  to
our survival.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning.
I  would  like  to  welcome  the  witnesses  to  today’s  hearing  on
NASA’s  Earth  Science  program.  We  have  a  distinguished  panel  of
witnesses, and I look forward to their testimony.

Let me first say that you—that we all live now in a city with lots
of  conflicts  and  where  Democrats  and  Republicans  often  times  dis-
agree  frequently  and  legitimately  on  issues.  But  let  there  be  no
mistake,  I  want  to  concur  with  the  Chairman’s  statement  today.
On  this  committee,  I  think  we  are  in  complete  sync  on  his  state-
ment and on the direction that we need to move.

And  so  I  say  that  so  that  folks  don’t  think  that  there  is  a  crack
in  the  window  that  through  stalemate  more  autocratic  decisions
can  be  made.  So  just  for  the  record,  I  would  like  for  you  to  know
that.

NASA’s Earth Science program has long been one of NASA’s core
missions,  yet  NASA’s  core  missions  are  increasingly  threatened  by
the  new  budgetary  priorities  contained  in  the  President’s  explo-
ration  initiative.  Just  last  month,  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Sub-
committee heard about the precarious state of NASA’s Aeronautics
programs from a range of expert witnesses. One month before that,
this committee heard from Acting Administrator Gregory that some
2,000 existing jobs at the NASA centers would be eliminated by the
fall  of  next  year,  although  we  were  unable  to  get  any  clear  expla-
nation  of  the  rationale  for  the  cuts  or  the  process  by  which  they
would be made.

Today,  we  are  going  to  hear  more  bad  news  from  a  panel  of  ex-
pert  witnesses.  The  bottom  line  appears  to  be  that  NASA’s  Earth
Science  program  faces  the  prospects  of  being  marginalized  in  the
coming years as the Agency puts its focus on the President’s explo-
ration initiative.

facts.

Let  me  quote  some  excerpts  from  the  National  Research  Coun-
cil’s  just-released  interim  report  on  Earth  sciences.  And  I  quote:
‘‘Today,  this  system  of  environmental  satellites  is  at  risk  of  col-
lapse.
. .NASA has no plan to replace its Earth Observing System
platforms  after  their  nominal  six-year  lifetimes  end.
.and  it  has
canceled, de-scoped, or delayed at least six planned missions—’’

The NRC committee goes on to say, and I quote: ‘‘These decisions
appear  to  be  driven  by  a  major  shift  in  priorities  at  a  time  when
NASA  is  moving  to  implement  a  new  vision  for  space  exploration.
This change in priorities jeopardizes NASA’s ability to fulfill its ob-
ligations  in  other  important  presidential  initiatives,  such  as  Cli-
mate  Change  Research  Initiative  and  the  subsequent  Climate
Change  Science  Program.  It  also  calls  into  question  future  U.S.
leadership  in  the  Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems,  an
international effort initiated by the current Administration.’’

That  is  tough  language,  but  it  appears  to  be  consistent  with  the

.

I  count  myself  among  strong  supporters  of  exploration,  but  as  I
said  on  previous  occasions,  we  have  to  be  willing  to  pay  for  it.  We
shouldn’t try to implement it by cannibalizing NASA’s other impor-
tant programs.

Yet  the  fact  is  that  when  the  President  cut  $2.5  billion  from
NASA’s  funding  plan  for  fiscal  year  2006  through  2009  relative  to
what  he  had  promised  just  a  year  earlier,  NASA  imposed  75  per-
cent  of  the  cut  on  NASA’s  Science  and  Aeronautics  program  and
only 10 percent on NASA’s Exploration Systems program.

In  reality,  fiscal  year  2006  funding  requests  for  NASA’s  Earth
Science  Research  program  is  $647  million  lower  than  the  funding
plan  for  fiscal  year  2006  contained  in  the  fiscal  year  2004  budget
request. That is a reduction of 24 percent in just two years.

It  is  no  wonder  that  the  Earth  science  program  is  canceling  and
delaying  missions.  And  the  problem  has  been  compounded  by
NASA’s  apparent  unwillingness  or  inability  to  date  to  develop  a
long-term vision for Earth science and application programs.

So where does all of this leave us?
Let  me  quote  the  National  Research  Council  once  again:  ‘‘Today

the Nation’s Earth Observatory program is at risk.’’

And  let  me  remind  you  of  a  hearing  just,  I  guess,  a  couple  of
years  ago  when  Richard  Blomberg  of  the  National  Shuttle  Safety
Panel  had  something  similar  to  say,  that  that  Shuttle  was  at  risk.
I  don’t  think  he  meant  that  it  was  going  to  happen  the  next  day,
but he was correct.

And once again, let me quote this: ‘‘Today, the Nation’s Earth ob-
servatory  program  is  at  risk.’’  I  think  we  need  to  take  that  seri-
ously.

I  want  to  hear  our  NASA  witnesses  respond  to  the  National  Re-
search  Council’s  findings.  Does  NASA  dispute  the  facts  presented
by  the  NRC?  And  if  not,  why  has  NASA  let  its  Earth  science  pro-
gram  reach  this  state  of  affairs?  And  most  importantly,  what  is
NASA’s  long-term  commitment  to  Earth  science  and  applications
research, and what, if anything, is NASA prepared to do to reverse
the current trend?

As  our  Chairman  said  earlier,  I  suspect  part  of  the  answer  is
these  functions  will  be  picked  up  by  NOAA.  Well,  if  that  is  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

case,  I  would  like  to  know  what  that  amount  of  cost  will  be  and
what funding, additional funding, would be going to NOAA to pick
that up.

In  closing,  I  again  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  participating

in today’s hearing. I look forward to your testimony.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Good  morning.  I’d  like  to  welcome  the  witnesses  to  today’s  hearing  on  NASA’s
Earth Science program. We have a distinguished panel of witnesses, and I look for-
ward to their testimony.

NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  has  long  been  one  of  NASA’s  core  missions.  Yet
NASA’s  core  missions  are  increasingly  threatened  by  the  new  budgetary  priorities
contained in the President’s exploration initiative.

Just  last  month,  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  heard  about  the  pre-

carious state of NASA’s aeronautics programs from a range of expert witnesses.

One month before that, this committee heard from Acting Administrator Gregory
that  some  2,000  existing  jobs  at  the  NASA  Centers  would  be  eliminated  by  the  fall
of next year. Although we were unable to get any clear explanation of the rationale
for the cuts or the process by which they would be made.

Today we are going to hear more bad news from a panel of expert witnesses.
The bottom line appears to be that NASA’s Earth Science program faces the pros-
pect  of  being  marginalized  in  the  coming  years  as  the  Agency  puts  its  focus  on  the
President’s exploration initiative.

Let me quote some excerpts from the National Research Council’s just-released in-

terim report on the Earth Sciences:

‘‘Today,  this  system  of  environmental  satellites  is  at  risk  of  collapse. . .NASA
has no plan to replace its Earth Observing System platforms after their nominal
six-year  lifetimes  end. . .and  it  has  canceled,  de-scoped,  or  delayed  at  least  six
planned missions. . .

The NRC committee goes on to say:

‘‘These decisions appear to be driven by a major shift in priorities at a time when
NASA  is  moving  to  implement  a  new  vision  for  space  exploration.  This  change
in  priorities  jeopardizes  NASA’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  obligations  in  other  impor-
tant presidential initiatives, such as the Climate Change Research Initiative and
the  subsequent  Climate  Change  Science  Program.  It  also  calls  into  question  fu-
ture U.S. leadership in the Global Earth Observing System of Systems, an inter-
national effort initiated by the current Administration.’’

That is tough language, but it appears to be consistent with the facts.
I count myself among the strong supporters of exploration, but as I’ve said on pre-
vious  occasions,  we  have  to  be  willing  to  pay  for  it.  We  shouldn’t  try  to  implement
it by cannibalizing NASA’s other important programs.

Yet, the fact is that when the President cut $2.5 billion from NASA’s funding plan
for  FY  2006  through  2009  relative  to  what  he  had  promised  just  a  year  earlier,
NASA imposed 75 percent of that cut on NASA’s science and aeronautics programs
and only 10 percent on NASA’s Exploration Systems programs.

In  reality,  the  FY  2006  funding  request  for  NASA’s  Earth-Sun  Science  research
program  is  $645  million  lower  than  the  funding  plan  for  FY  2006  contained  in  the
FY 2004 budget request. That’s a reduction of 24 percent in just two years.

It’s no wonder that the Earth Science program is canceling and delaying missions.
And the problem has been compounded by NASA’s apparent unwillingness or inabil-
ity to date to develop a long-term vision for its Earth Science and Applications pro-
grams.

So where does all of this leave us?
Let me again quote the National Research Council’s report:
‘‘Today the Nation’s Earth observation program is at risk.’’

I want to hear our NASA witness respond to the National Research Council’s find-
ings.  Does  NASA  dispute  the  facts  presented  by  the  NRC?  And  if  not,  why  has
NASA  let  its  Earth  Science  program  reach  this  state  of  affairs?  And  most  impor-
tantly, what is NASA’s long-term commitment to Earth Science and Applications re-
search,  and  what—if  anything—is  NASA  prepared  to  do  to  reverse  the  current
trends?

In  closing,  I  again  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  participating  in  today’s  hear-

ing, and I look forward to your testimony.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon.
And  I  think,  for  the  audience,  who  are  so  familiar  with  atmos-
phere  on  Capitol  Hill  these  days,  how  refreshing  it  is  to  see  the
same  basic  thrust  of  the  remarks  from  both  sides  of  the  center
aisle.  This  committee  is  noted  for  working  cooperatively  on  impor-
tant  and  sensitive  subjects.  We  try  to  go  forward  together.  That  is
not just a clich´ e; it is a modus operandi.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good Morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before the Committee
to examine the state of the Earth science programs of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA).

The  primary  activities  of  NASA’s  Earth  science  programs  are  to  develop  and
launch  research  satellites  designed  to  improve  our  understanding  of  the  land,
oceans,  and  atmosphere.  NASA  missions  have  helped  improve  our  knowledge  and
create new capabilities leading to advances in weather forecasting, storm warnings,
and natural resource management.

I  am  aware  that  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  Committee  on  Earth
Science  Applications  from  Science  is  currently  conducting  a  ‘‘Decadal  Survey’’  for
Earth science observations from space at NASA’s request. This will be the first time
a  decadal  survey  has  been  conducted  for  Earth  science  and  is  expected  to  establish
a prioritized list of research projects. I look forward to hearing from the NAS Com-
mittee Chair, Dr. Berrien Moore, to assess how the survey is progressing.

With regard to NASA’s Earth Science budget for fiscal year 2006, I am aware that
funding  for  the  program  has  declined  each  year  since  FY  2004,  and  the  President’s
FY 2006 budget submission continues this reduction. These budget reductions have
led NASA to delay, cancel or scale back most Earth science missions. Furthermore,
NASA has few if any additional Earth science missions in the planning pipeline be-
yond  the  missions  that  have  been  in  the  works  for  years.  Also,  NASA  does  not  ap-
pear  to  have  sufficient  funds  to  launch  some  of  the  missions  that  it  describes  as
being  on  schedule.  If  one  of  NASA’s  primary  roles  in  the  Earth  sciences  program
is  to  build  and  launch  research  satellites  to  provide  a  deeper  understanding  of  the
basic  processes  governing  the  Earth’s  physical  system,  I  am  skeptical  of  NASA’s
ability to operate a successful Earth science program that lives up to its objectives.
Again,  I  thank  the  witnesses  for  appearing  today  and  look  forward  to  their  testi-

mony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for  calling  this  very  important  hearing  today.  I  wel-
come our distinguished witnesses, and I would like to thank you for agreeing to tes-
tify  here  today  on  the  importance  of  the  NASA  and  their  Earth  Science  programs.
The  purpose  of  this  hearing  is  to  examine  the  state  of  Earth  science  programs  of

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The theme for Earth Science Week in 2004 was ‘‘Living on a Restless Earth.’’ The
global community is affected by the restless nature of our planet every day. Natural
hazards such as earthquakes, storms, volcanoes, and landslides threaten our homes
and  businesses,  but  they  also  provide  evidence  of  the  incredible  power  and  beauty
of our planet. We were reminded of this incredible power this past December when
South Eastern Asia was devastated by the horrific affects of a Tsunami.

As  we  discuss  the  enormous  devastation  caused  by  this  natural  disaster,  the  one

question we must ask ourselves is could this have been avoided?

The  space  exploration  research  program  has  been  one  of  the  most  successful  re-
search  programs  in  the  history  of  this  country.  Unfortunately,  this  year,  NASA
plans to cut $120 million or eight percent from last year’s budget.

A newly released study by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that budg-

et cuts threaten the vitality of NASA’s Earth science programs.

Our  challenge  today  is  to  achieve  an  increased  public  perception  and  awareness
of  the  tremendous  importance  and  value  that  the  NASA’s  Earth  Science  programs
for all people.

I  agree  with  the  assessment  that  Earth  science  is  one  of  the  most  necessary  and
exciting  fields  of  the  science  community  today.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  this
committee on its advancement.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Udall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good morning. I’d like to join my colleagues in welcoming our witnesses to today’s
hearing.  I  am  particularly  eager  to  hear  from  Dr.  Tim  Killeen  from  the  National
Center for Atmospheric Research.

Dr.  Killeen  has  been  the  Director  of  NCAR  since  2000,  and  in  that  capacity  he
oversees the important research performed at NCAR. Of course, I have a particular
interest in NCAR because it is located within my congressional district. But in addi-
tion, the Center’s research has an impact nationwide since NCAR is operated by the
University  Corporation  for  Atmospheric  Research—or  UCAR—which  includes  68
universities across the country.

With  the  collaboration  of  these  universities,  NCAR  is  able  to  perform  research
that is beyond the capabilities of any one university. So welcome, Dr. Killen—I look
forward to your testimony.

Turning now to the topic of today’s hearing, I will say up front that I am a strong
believer in the importance of a strong national program in Earth science and appli-
cations. And I think that NASA, NOAA, and our universities have a critical role to
play in increasing our understanding of the Earth and its environment through the
collection and analysis of Earth observation data.

In  addition  to  being  of  interest  scientifically,  commercial  and  governmental  re-
mote sensing data can and should be leveraged to meet a variety of important soci-
etal  needs—including  such  things  as  land  use  planning,  homeland  security,  and
water resources management.

To that end, earlier this year I reintroduced H.R. 426, the Remote Sensing Appli-
cations  Act,  which  is  a  bill  that  already  passed  the  House  in  a  previous  Congress,
and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  to  advance
its goals in this Session.

However,  despite  the  importance  of  Earth  science  and  applications  research,  all
is  not  well  with  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program.  Indeed,  the  just-released  interim
report of a Committee of the National Research Council makes it clear that NASA’s
Earth Science program is facing a serious threat to its future viability.

In  that  regard,  the  NRC  report  enumerates  a  whole  series  of  planned  missions

and research activities that are being cut back or eliminated by NASA.

In addition, a number of currently operating missions that are still returning use-

ful scientific data—such as Voyager—are threatened with premature termination.

While  I  certainly  recognize  that  when  ongoing  missions  lose  their  scientific  pro-
ductivity they need to be turned off to free up resources for newer missions, a num-
ber of the missions threatened with termination do not appear to fall into that cat-
egory. I hope that NASA will take another look at those missions before doing some-
thing irrevocable.

Finally,  I’m  concerned  by  the  push  to  eliminate  or  significantly  delay  planned
NASA Earth Science missions such as the Landsat Follow-on mission and the Glory
mission.

With respect to Landsat, there may well be good budgetary or operational reasons
to  consider  moving  a  Landsat  sensor  onto  NPOESS,  the  joint  NOAA–DOD  weather
satellite  currently  under  development.  However,  I  am  concerned  that  neither  the
technical  impacts  of  such  a  move  nor  its  likely  cost  impacts  are  well  understood  at
this point.

I would hate for us to eliminate NASA’s planned Landsat follow-on spacecraft now
only to find out a few years down the road that trying to include a Landsat instru-
ment  on  NPOESS  is  having  unacceptable  impacts  on  the  NPOESS  program.  I  fear
that the ultimate outcome of such a situation could be a significant loss of Landsat
data continuity.

I  hope  that  the  witnesses  at  today’s  hearing  can  help  us  better  understand  what
the  implications  of  putting  NASA  missions  like  Landsat  onto  the  NPOESS  space-
craft  are,  and  what  we  will  need  to  pay  attention  to  if  we  agree  to  proceed  down
that path.

Well, Mr. Chairman, there are many other issues that I could mention, but at this
point I would rather yield back my time so we can hear from our witnesses. Thank
you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Ranking  Member,  thank  you  for  holding  this  important

hearing today.

Over  the  past  30  years,  NASA’s  Earth  Science  programs  have  resulted  in  impor-
tant  social  and  economic  benefits,  including  improved  weather  forecasting  and  im-
proved observation of sea surface winds and precipitation.

Better  forecasts  allow  for  more  efficient  evacuations  and  are  crucial  to  for  pro-
tecting  populations  in  areas  that  are  prone  to  natural  disasters,  including  hurri-
canes,  tornadoes,  floods,  earthquakes  and  tsunamis.  Furthermore,  businesses  and
infrastructure,  including  transportation  and  energy,  are  reliant  on  current  fore-
casting and need improved weather information.

These  improved  Earth  science  findings  are  tremendously  valuable—saving  pre-
cious  human  lives  and  property.  I  would  be  surprised  to  find  more  than  a  handful
of  congressional  districts  in  our  nation  that  do  not  risk  some  form  of  natural  dis-
aster.  These  are  crucial  programs  that  all  of  as  public  servants  have  an  obligation
to make certain are maintained.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  hearing  to  discuss  the  status
of NASA’s Earth Science programs. While we often think of NASA’s work to be sole-
ly in space, the truth is that NASA Earth Sciences have made many discoveries that
impact  our  day  to  day  lives  right  here  on  Earth.  In  fact  the  greatest  knowledge  we
can  learn  is  that  of  our  own  world  because  the  discovery  of  this  planet  is  far  from
complete.

There was a time in history when even scholars believed that Earth was flat. Ob-
viously  we  have  come  a  long  way  in  terms  of  discovery  since  that  time.  We  will  al-
ways push the limits of innovation, but in order to do so we must invest the proper
resources.  Indeed,  NASA’s  own  mission  statement  begins  with  the  goal,  ‘‘To  under-
stand  and  protect  our  home  planet.’’  NASA  research  in  Earth  science  has  focused
on  understanding  how  the  Earth’s  atmosphere,  oceans,  and  land  interact  and  oper-
ate as a whole. Unfortunately, NASA proposes to spend about $1.37 billion on Earth
science research in Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, a cut of about $120 million, or eight per-
cent,  from  FY  2005  (or  about  $180  million,  or  12  percent,  below  the  FY04  request).
These  cuts  threaten  many  programs  that  would  increase  our  knowledge  of  this
Earth.  In  fact,  the  knowledge  gained  through  Earth  science  could  help  avert  many
natural disasters. The tragic events following the earthquake and tsunami in South
Asia  highlight  the  global  need  for  coordinated  disaster  preparedness  and  response.
Seismometers  detected  the  earthquake  that  triggered  the  tsunami  and  satellite  al-
timeters  detected  the  tsunami  before  it  struck  land.  A  tsunami  warning  system
could  potentially  have  saved  tens  of  thousands  of  lives,  but  it  did  not  exist  in  this
region. In the aftermath of the disaster, a wide array of high-resolution satellite im-
ages  and  measurements  are  helping  guide  and  monitor  relief  and  recovery  efforts
and assisting in the deployment of resources (food, water, and medical supplies). As
nations  rebuild  their  devastated  communities,  Earth  observations  will  provide  crit-
ical  inputs  into  decisions  on  the  location,  land  use,  and  type  of  disaster-resistant
construction  practices  that  will  improve  human  conditions  in  these  disaster-prone
regions.

I find it deeply unfortunate that these budget cuts will potentially end many suc-
cessful  programs  that  measure  our  environmental  standard  of  life  and  could  help
us  improve  upon  our  condition.  Many  Earth  observation  missions  have  been  can-
celed, delayed, or their scope has been severely limited. I have been a long time sup-
porter  of  NASA  in  this  committee  and  have  supported  the  President’s  Vision  for
Space  Exploration,  but  those  endeavors  should  not  cause  us  to  limit  our  discovery
right here on Earth. Again, the most important lessons we can learn are those about
ourselves, because we as a human race must inhabit this Earth for many more gen-
erations to come and to limit our knowledge will only decrease our chances of doing
so.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE AL GREEN

I’d  like  to  thank  Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  the  state  of  Earth  science  programs  at  NASA.  I  had  the  oppor-
tunity to witness the devastation caused by the tsunami that occurred December 26,
2004. We have all seen the increasing devastation caused by the various hurricanes
that  hit  Florida  over  the  past  year.  We  have  all  witnessed  the  variant  climate
changes  from  El  Nin˜ o.  Given  the  increasing  vulnerability  to  extreme  weather  and
climate  variations,  federal  investments  in  these  areas  of  research  are  more  impor-
tant than ever. I realize that we have a nation and a variety of good programs that
will  be  affected  by  the  tightening  of  our  federal  fiscal  belt,  so  I  relish  the  chance
to  speak  to  the  experts  on  their  views  of  the  effects  of  such  changes.  To  my  knowl-
edge,  Earth  science  research  is  set  to  sustain  about  an  eight  percent  cut  from  the
last  fiscal  year,  and  I  hope  that  any  or  all  of  you  may  be  able  to  elaborate  about
what we will see as results.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Now  with  that,  let  me  introduce  our  very
distinguished panel, and I thank all of you for serving as resources
for this committee.

First,  we  have  Mr.  Alphonso  Diaz,  the  Associate  Administrator
at  NASA  for  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  with  whom  I  had  a
very  constructive  and  productive  meeting  yesterday.  Dr.  Berrien
Moore is the Co-Chair of the National Academy of Science’s decadal
survey,  Earth  Observations  from  Space,  a  Community  Assessment
and Strategy for the Future. Dr. Moore is also the Director for the
Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the Univer-
sity of New Hampshire. Dr. Moore, welcome. Dr. Tim Killeen is the
Director  of  the  National  Center  for  Atmospheric  Research  in  Boul-
der,  Colorado.  Doctor,  welcome.  Dr.  Marcia  McNutt  is  the  Presi-
dent—oh,  I  have  skipped  Dr.  Solomon.  Excuse  me.  Well,  I  will  get
Dr.  McNutt  since  I  started.  Dr.  Marcia  McNutt  is  the  President
and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium  Re-
search  Institute  in  Lost  Landing,  California.  Doctor,  welcome.  Dr.
Sean  Solomon  is  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Terrestrial
Magnetism  at  the  Carnegie  Institution  of  Washington.  Dr.  Sol-
omon, welcome. And finally, Dr. Ray Williamson is a Research Pro-
fessor in the Space Policy Institute at the George Washington Uni-
versity. Doctor, welcome.

With that, you all are experienced in this process. You know, the
drill. Essentially, we ask that you summarize in approximately five
minutes.  The  Chair  is  never  arbitrary  when  we  have  six  distin-
guished  witnesses  before  us,  but  if  you  can  condense  your  opening
remarks, that allows more opportunity for what is the most produc-
tive  part  of  the  hearing,  and  that  is  the  dialogue  between  those  of
us who are privileged to be representatives and those of you in the
wide world out there that we represent.
With that, Mr. Diaz, you are first up.

STATEMENT OF MR. ALPHONSO V. DIAZ, ASSOCIATE

ADMINISTRATOR, SCIENCE DIRECTORATE, NASA

Mr.  DIAZ.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you,  Ranking
Member  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  especially
thank  you  Mr.  Boehlert,  Mr.  Gordon,  and  Mr.  Calvert,  who  I  did
meet with yesterday, and I think also we had a constructive discus-
sion. So thank you very much for that.

As  I  have  said  yesterday  and  will  say  again,  I  think  we  have
come  a  long  way  in  my  career  at  NASA  over  the  past  30  to  40

years in our pursuit of understanding the Earth, the Solar System,
and the Universe.

From  our  constellation  of  Earth  Observation  System  Satellites
helping to assess the emergence and spread of disease, the melting
of glaciers, and the recovery efforts following the recent tsunami to
our  knowledge  about  life  forms  thriving  in  extreme  environments
helping  us  to  understand  and  develop  strategies  to  search  for  evi-
dence  of  life  beyond  our  home  planet,  NASA’s  accomplishments  in
Earth science are many and varied.

As  one  recent  example,  last  week’s  edition  of  the  Journal  of
Science  published  a  new  study  showing  that  a  decrease  in  snow
cover  in  the  Himalayas  causes  an  increase  in  algal  blooms  thou-
sands  of  miles  away  off  the  coasts  of  Somalia,  Yemen,  and  Oman.
This finding was based on data collected over the past two decades
by  instruments  on  four  different  satellites  that  reflect  NASA’s
intergovernmental,  interagency,  and  commercial  partnerships;  the
Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission,  the  Advanced  Earth  Observ-
ing System of Japan, the operational weather satellites that are op-
erated by NOAA, and the instrument on Orbital Sciences Corpora-
tion Seastar.

We recognize that, as you indicated, Mr. Chairman, that by first
understanding  how  to  study  the  Earth  as  a  planet,  we  can  better
prepare  for  sending  humans  to  the  Moon,  Mars,  and  beyond.  The
Vision  for  Space  Exploration  and  subsequent  agency-wide  trans-
formation has presented NASA’s science endeavors with an historic
opportunity.  By  merging  space  science  with  its  emphasis  on  dis-
covery  with  Earth  science’s  emphasis  on  capability  for  prediction,
the Science Mission Directorate, I believe, is uniquely positioned to
engage  in  comprehensive  scientific  investigations  into  the  origin,
evolution,  and  destiny  of  Earth,  the  Solar  System,  and  the  Uni-
verse.

We  are  in  the  midst  of  a  transition  in  Earth  science  from  a
NASA-centric  approach  to  a  national  strategy  that  maximizes  all
our national capabilities. These changes have created some anxiety,
I recognized, and have caused some to question our commitment to
Earth science. We have a responsibility to clarify the current strat-
egy  with  all  our  stakeholders  and  to  include  them  in  the  process
as we go forward, and as I have said, we intend to do so.

There are several ways that I believe you can gauge our commit-

ment to Earth science.

The  actions  in  the  2005  budget,  I  believe,  should  be  interpreted
as  a  sign  of  the  Administration’s  interest  in  accelerating  the  evo-
lution of Earth science to a national program, not as a retreat from
our  NASA  commitment  to  Earth  science.  The  President’s  2006
budget  request  will  support  a  highly-effective  program  of  research
and  development  of  Earth  sciences  that  enables  NASA  to  play  a
critical  role  in  four  major  presidential  directed  programs:  the  Cli-
mate Change Science Program, the Global Earth Observing System
of Systems, the Grand Challenges and Natural Disaster Reduction,
and the Vision for Space Exploration.

As  an  example  of  our  commitment  to  these  initiatives,  NASA’s
Earth  science  program  contributes  over  60  percent  of  the  total
funding  to  the  Administration’s  Climate  Change  Science  Program.
The  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  also  supports  several  critical

missions: 16 Earth science missions on orbit, eight missions sched-
uled  to  launch  by  2010,  and  eight  missions  currently  in  formula-
tion.

We have several exciting Earth science missions coming up with
launches scheduled later this year, CloudSat and CALIPSO. In ad-
dition,  we  have  several  missions  in  development,  such  as  the
NPOESS  Preparatory  Project,  NPP,  that  we  are—that  we  and  our
partners  believe  are  vital  to  evolving  from  research  to  operations.
Further, the Global Precipitation Mission is currently in formula-
tion,  along  with  several  smaller  missions  in  the  Earth  systems
science pathfinder line.

While  some  Science  Mission  Directorate  missions  have  been  de-
layed  one  to  two  years  to  respond  to  other  national  priorities,  this
decision  applies  to  all  science  missions  that  have  not  passed  their
confirmation review, not just those in Earth science.

To  help  chart  our  course  ahead,  we  have  established  a  two-
pronged  approach  to  obtaining  community  advice  on  the  future  of
the Earth sciences at NASA. As part of the broader NASA planning
effort to implement the Vision for Space Exploration, and other na-
tional  objectives  articulated  in  the  New  Age  of  Space  Exploration,
we have established 13 strategic road map committees, one specifi-
cally  focused  on  the  dynamic  Earth  system.  We  have  recently  re-
ceived this committee’s draft report and are pleased with the prod-
ucts  and  progress.  We  expect  the  final  report  within  the  next  few
weeks,  and  we  will  integrate  them  all  into  the  Agency’s  next  stra-
tegic plan.

NASA  has  also  requested  that  the  National  Research  Council
generate a community-led decadal survey for Earth science. We are
still  digesting  the  recently  received  NRC  Earth  Science  Decadal
Survey  Phase  One  Report,  and  we  will  carefully  consider  its  rec-
ommendations together with our partners at NOAA.

While  the  decadal  survey  and  the  Dynamic  Earth  System  Stra-
tegic Road map are still in development, some aspects of the direc-
tion  we  will  take  are  already  clear.  We  will  continue  working  in
partnerships  with  our  international  partners,  as  well  as  our  inter-
agency partners. We believe that that will provide us an implemen-
tation strategy that leverages our resources in a very effective way.
I would like to highlight the working relationship that NASA en-
joys with NOAA, given the natural synergy and history of coordina-
tion  and  cooperation  between  Earth  and  space  weather  scientists
and  NASA  and  NOAA  management.  By  partnering  with  NASA—
excuse  me,  with  NOAA,  we  are  enabling  improved  weather  pre-
diction,  severe  storm  forecasting,  and  climate  prediction  services.
Further,  we  intend  to  increase  our  emphasis  on  having  Earth
science benefit our exploration program through the development of
an operational capability to predict space weather.

Through  our  collaborative  effort,  not  only  can  we  answer  ques-
tions  of  how  and  why  the  Sun  varies,  but  also  how  the  Earth  re-
sponds  to  these  changes  and  the  implications  of  these  changes  to
society.  Understanding  that  is  critical  as  we  send  humans  to  the
Moon, Mars, and beyond.

We  believe  that  we  have  effectively  combined  NASA’s  strengths
in  research  and  technology  development  with  NOAA’s  capabilities

to sustain a long-term operational system of satellites, creating the
most effective system for American taxpayers.

I  look  forward  to  the  upcoming  launch  of  NOAA–N  as  some  evi-
dence  of  this  and  the  launch  of  the  NPOESS  Preparatory  Mission
as further amplification.

Thank  you,  again,  for  the  opportunity  to  appear,  and  I  look  for-

ward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Diaz follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALPHONSO V. DIAZ

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
appear today to discuss NASA’s commitment to maintaining robust Earth and space
science programs and their contributions to achieving the Nation’s Vision for Space
Exploration.

The Science Mission Directorate provides leadership to NASA at the agency level,
delivering  a  unique  scientific  perspective.  The  Earth  and  space  science  activities  of
the Science Mission Directorate fully support NASA’s mission to:

study the Earth system and improve prediction of Earth system change

• Understand  and  Protect  our  Home  Planet  by  using  our  view  from  space  to
• Explore  the  Universe  and  Search  for  Life  by  continuing  scientific  investiga-
tions into the origin, evolution, and destiny of the universe and our solar sys-
tem, and by applying our scientific understanding of the Earth system to the
identification and study of Earth-like planets around other stars
• Inspire  the  Next  Generation  of  Explorers  by  providing  Earth  and  Space
science  content  and  training  to  educators,  and  by  sponsoring  the  education
and early careers of Earth scientists, astronomers, and physicists.

On  January  14,  2004,  President  George  W.  Bush  announced  the  Vision  for  Space
Exploration.  The  President’s  directive  gave  NASA  a  new  focus  and  clear  objectives.
The  fundamental  goal  of  this  directive  for  the  Nation’s  space  exploration  program
is  ‘‘. . .to  advance  U.S.  scientific  security,  and  economic  interests  through  a  robust
space  exploration  program.’’  In  issuing  this  directive,  the  President  committed  the
Nation to a journey of returning humans to the Moon, sending robots and ultimately
humans  to  Mars,  and  exploring  the  solar  system  and  beyond.  He  challenged  us  to
establish  new  and  innovative  programs  to  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  plan-
ets, to ask new questions and to answer questions as old as humankind. NASA en-
thusiastically embraced this directive and immediately began an agency-wide trans-
formation to enable us to achieve the Vision.

NASA’s recently published document, The New Age of Exploration: NASA’s Direc-
tion  for  2005  and  Beyond,  articulates  NASA’s  commitment  to  implementing  the  Vi-
sion for Space Exploration. It identifies NASA’s Guiding National Objectives to:

1. Implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore

the solar system and beyond

2. Extend  human  presence  across  the  solar  system,  starting  with  the  Moon  by
the  year  2020,  in  preparation  for  human  exploration  of  Mars  and  other  des-
tinations

3. Develop  innovative  technologies,  knowledge,  and  infrastructure  both  to  ex-
plore  and  to  support  decisions  about  the  destinations  for  human  exploration

4. Promote international and commercial participation in exploration
5. Study the Earth System from space and develop new space-based and related

capabilities for this purpose

NASA  Earth  science  is  critical  for  fulfilling  NASA’s  mission  because  of  NASA’s
unique  capabilities  of  frequent  global  observations,  modeling  and  data  assimilation
with  the  aim  to  improve  prediction  of  both  large-scale  and  small-scale  processes.
Human  exploration  of  Mars  and  beyond  requires  prediction  of  the  environment  to
be  encountered  by  humans.  The  technological  tools  and  scientific  skills  that  NASA
continues  to  develop  through  studying  Earth,  which  has  the  most  complex  eco-
system  with  continuous  interactions  of  biological,  chemical  and  physical  processes
at  all  time  and  space  scales,  are  critical  in  the  exploration  and  search  for  life  of
other planets in our own solar system and beyond.

In  June  2004,  the  President’s  Commission  on  the  Implementation  of  the  United
States Space Exploration Policy, led by E.C. ‘‘Pete’’ Aldridge, Jr. (the Aldridge Com-
mission), and reported their findings and recommendations to the President. The Al-

dridge  Commission  emphasized  the  crucial  roles  that  technological  innovation,  na-
tional  and  international  partnerships,  and  organizational  transformation  must  play
if  we  are  to  implement  the  President’s  Vision  for  an  affordable  and  sustainable
space  exploration  program.  NASA  is  committed  to  making  the  necessary  trans-
formation  to  ensure  our  success  in  achieving  the  Vision  for  an  affordable  and  sus-
tainable space exploration program.
The Historic Opportunity to Implement the Vision

The  transformation  presents  NASA’s  science  endeavors  with  an  historic  oppor-
tunity to support and benefit from the Vision for Space Exploration. As the National
Research  Council  stated  in  their  report,  Science  in  NASA’s  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration  (2005),  ‘‘the  appropriate  science  in  a  vibrant  space  program  is  nothing  less
than that science that will transform our understanding of the universe around us,
and  will  in  time  transform  us  into  a  space-faring  civilization  that  extends  human
presence across the solar system.’’

In August 2004, NASA repositioned its science endeavors by merging two science
Enterprises into one Science Mission Directorate with three themes: Earth-Sun Sys-
tem, Solar System Exploration, and Universe. The merger of Space Science, with its
emphasis  on  ‘‘discovery,’’  and  Earth  Science’s  capacity  for  ‘‘prediction’’  positions  the
Science Mission Directorate to support the Vision by engaging in comprehensive sci-
entific investigations into the Origin, Evolution, and Destiny of the Earth, the Solar
System,  and  the  Universe.  The  synergies  facilitated  by  this  integration  will  benefit
research, development, and improve science results in all NASA science disciplines,
including  Earth  science.  Furthermore,  a  unified  Science  Mission  Directorate  facili-
tates  the  opportunity  for  all  of  the  discipline  areas  of  science  to  learn  from  each
other which, in turn, enhances NASA’s exploration activities.
Planning for the Future

NASA  has  identified  eighteen  strategic  objectives,  from  which  thirteen  strategic
roadmaps will be derived. Six of these roadmaps directly apply to the activities and
research  objectives  of  the  Science  Mission  Directorate.  The  current  strategic  plan-
ning  process  forms  the  basis  for  our  future  strategy  for  Earth  and  space  science.
Through our actions, we are clearly emphasizing a continuing commitment to Earth
science  and  NASA’s  commitment  to  study  the  Earth  system  is  clearly  reflected  in
our  national  objectives.  Not  only  will  these  studies  better  inform  our  work  as  we
implement  the  Vision,  but  will  strengthen  our  ability  to  continue  to  support  Presi-
dential  initiatives  involving  climate  change  science  and  technology,  the  oceans,  an
integrated Earth observation system, and others.
Strategic Roadmapping

While  the  ‘‘Aldridge’’  Commission  provided  the  blueprint  for  NASA’s  ongoing
transformation in support of the Vision, NASA’s strategic planning efforts are defin-
ing the specific details for The New Age of Exploration. New strategic roadmaps will
provide a foundation for future investment decisions and priorities in 13 key areas.
Each strategic roadmap is being developed by a team composed of nationally-recog-
nized  scientists,  engineers,  educators,  visionaries,  and  managers,  organized  into
dedicated  teams  co-chaired  by  senior  NASA  leaders  and  nationally  recognized  lead-
ers  from  industry  and  academia.  In  some  strategic  roadmap  areas,  thematic  road-
maps  already  exist  or  are  in  development.  These  ‘‘legacy’’  products  and  activities
will be integrated into the new process.

The  Dynamic  Earth  System  roadmap  committee  submitted  its  interim  status  re-
port  to  NASA  for  review  on  April  15.  The  work  being  done  by  this  roadmapping
committee  has  already  identified  a  number  of  missions  that  NASA  should  consider
in  the  future.  For  Earth  science,  the  roadmap  assumes  the  successful  implementa-
tion of the currently planned mission set, such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory,
Aquarius,  and  the  Global  Precipitation  Measurement  missions.  Likewise,  for  the
Sun-Earth  Connection,  the  roadmap  assumes  the  successful  implementation  of
STEREO,  Solar-B,  Magnetosphere  Multi-Scale,  Radiation  Belt  Storm  Probes,  and
the Solar Dynamics Observatory missions.

In  addition,  the  Dynamic  Earth  System  and  Sun-Solar  System  Connection  road-
map committees are coordinating their activities and held a joint meeting on March
16, 2005. Interim reports from the two committees evidence interest in similar mis-
sions. Such missions have considerable importance for Earth science and the Vision
for  Space  Exploration  by  enabling  high-temporal  resolution  of  atmospheric  changes
and  solar  influences  on  climate,  and  by  providing  a  capability  to  monitor  space
weather and solar events that could be hazardous to spacecraft and astronauts.

Unlike the other roadmap committees, the Dynamic Earth System committee did
not  have  the  benefit  of  a  National  Research  Council  Decadal  Survey  as  a  starting
input;  such  a  survey  was  requested  shortly  before  the  roadmapping  activity  began

and  is  currently  in  work.  NASA  expects  to  receive  the  final  Phase  II  report  by  the
end of calendar year 2006. However, the Dynamic Earth System committee will ben-
efit  from  other  detailed,  strategic  planning  documents  from  NASA  and  national
planning processes such as the U.S. Climate Change Science Plan, the Grand Chal-
lenges  for  Natural  Disaster  Reduction,  and  the  U.S.  Integrated  Earth  Observation
System.

We  have  recently  received  the  Dynamic  Earth  System  committee’s  draft  report
and  are  pleased  with  the  Committee’s  products  and  progress.  We  appreciate  their
hard work and support and value their contributions to this critical endeavor.
Decadal Study

At  the  request  of  NASA  and  NOAA,  the  National  Research  Council  is  carrying
out a ‘‘decadal survey’’ entitled ‘‘Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Com-
munity Assessment and Strategy for the Future.’’ The Space Studies Board, in con-
sultation with other units of the NRC, will lead the study to generate consensus rec-
ommendations  from  the  Earth  and  environmental  science  and  applications  commu-
nities  regarding  a  systems  approach  to  space-based  and  ancillary  observations  that
encompasses  the  research  programs  of  NASA  and  the  related  operational  programs
of NOAA.

The key goals of the study are:

tional approaches to address those priorities.

• Articulate  priorities  for  Earth  system  science  and  the  space-based  observa-
• Establish  individual  plans  and  priorities  within  the  sub-disciplines  of  the
Earth sciences as well as an integrated vision and plan for the Earth sciences
as a whole.

Providing  Continued  Leadership  While  Leveraging  Partnerships  in  Earth

Sciences

Presidential Initiatives

The  FY06  budget  supports  critical  national  needs,  including  climate  change  by
supporting  investments  in  the  U.S.  Global  Change  Science  and  Technology  Pro-
grams and next generation Earth observing satellites.

In addition to supporting the Vision for Space Exploration, NASA’s Earth science

program has a critical role in implementing important Administration initiatives:

• Global Earth Observation System of Systems via the U.S. Group on Earth Ob-
servations—The  purpose  of  GEOSS  is  to  achieve  comprehensive,  coordinated
and  sustained  observations  of  the  Earth  system,  in  order  to  improve  moni-
toring  of  the  state  of  the  Earth,  increase  understanding  of  Earth  processes,
and  enhance  prediction  of  the  behavior  of  the  Earth  system.  NASA’s  Earth
Observing  System  supports  this  effort  through  a  series  of  polar-orbiting  and
low  inclination  satellites,  a  science  component,  and  a  data  system  of  long-
term  global  observations  of  the  land  surface,  biosphere,  solid  Earth,  atmos-
phere, and oceans.
• Climate Change Science Program—NASA’s Earth science program is the larg-
est  contributor  (over  60  percent  of  the  total  funding)  to  the  Administration’s
Climate  Change  Science  Program.  NASA  brings  the  global  perspective  from
satellite  and  sub-orbital  measurements  to  address  climate  and  global  change
science  questions.  NASA  has  the  end-to-end  capability  to  develop  tech-
nologies,  models,  deploy  observing  systems  and  utilize  and  provide  products
for decision support systems.
• Grand Challenges in Natural Disaster Reduction—NASA research and obser-
vations are essential to help the U.S. meet its disaster reduction goals for the
next  decade.  Through  its  ability  to  view  the  Earth  as  a  dynamic  system,
NASA makes key contributions to the science of hazard assessment and miti-
gation  and  provides  essential  support  to  the  efforts  of  other  federal  agencies
charged with these responsibilities.

International Partnerships

NASA  has  long-standing  relationships  with  foreign  countries  in  the  conduct  of
Earth science. Historically, over 50 percent of NASA’s Earth science programs have
involved  international  participation.  Such  partnerships  have  allowed  each  country
to leverage their Earth science resources to conduct outstanding science in the pur-
suit  of  understanding  our  Earth  and  the  forces  that  influence  its  change.  Cloudsat
and  CALIPSO,  scheduled  to  launch  this  summer,  exemplify  how  NASA  is  able  to
successfully collaborate with space agencies around the world. NASA and the Cana-

27

dian  Space  Agency  worked  together  to  develop  CloudSat’s  Cloud  Profiling  Radar.
For  CALIPSO,  CNES,  the  French  space  agency,  not  only  provided  the  spacecraft
and the Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), but is also performing payload-to-space-
craft integration and spacecraft mission operations.

In  support  of  the  Vision  for  U.S.  Space  Exploration,  the  Science  Mission  Direc-
torate  held  a  conference  this  past  March  that  included  participation  from  26  inter-
national  organizations.  In  some  cases  the  participants  were  representatives  from
multilateral  organizations  such  as  the  Central  American  Commission  on  Environ-
ment  and  Development  (CCAD),  the  European  Commission  (EC),  and  the  United
Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO).  The  con-
ference provided a forum for NASA and its international partners to exchange infor-
mation  on  the  Vision  and  to  discuss  opportunities  for  enhanced  future  cooperation.
A  recurring  theme  at  the  conference  was  the  importance  of  international  collabora-
tion and information sharing in achieving common scientific priorities.
Interagency Partnerships

NASA works closely with our partner agencies on national programs including the
Climate Change Science Program, the Grand Challenges in Disaster Reduction, and
Integrated  Earth  Observation  System.  We  value  our  long  history  of  collaboration
with research agencies, such as NSF and DOE, as well as operational agencies, such
as  EPA,  USDA,  DOI  and  NOAA.  We  are  committed  to  continuing  to  work  closely
with our partner agencies to ensure the continuity of data sets crucial to our nation.
NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) of the Department of Interior have
cooperated to produce new global land cover data products for each of three different
time  periods:  the  1970s,  circa  1990,  and  circa  2000.  The  DOI  (USGS)  and  NASA
share  responsibility  for  preserving  and  populating  the  National  Satellite  Land  Re-
mote  Sensing  Data  Archive  and  ensuring  the  continued  collection  of  Landsat  data.
The  Landsat  Program  is  the  longest  running  enterprise  for  acquisition  of  imagery
of  the  Earth  from  space.  The  first  Landsat  satellite  was  launched  in  1972  and  the
most recent, Landsat 7, was launched in 1999. USGS’s 33-year Landsat data archive
provided  most  of  the  over  20,000  Landsat  satellite  images  needed.  In  partnership
with  private  industry  (the  Earth  Satellite  Corporation),  the  GeoCover  product  was
created.  Researchers,  planners,  and  land  managers  are  now  using  the  GeoCover
data to understand how the Earth’s land cover and land use have changed over the
past  thirty  years.  Recent  projects  have  documented  urbanization  in  the  U.S.  and
tracked  land  cover  change  on  the  biologically  rich  island  of  Madagascar.  A  new
project  is  underway  to  map  changes  in  North  American  forests  since  1975  as  part
of the North American Carbon Program. GeoCover data also have been made avail-
able  through  two  United  Nations  organizations,  the  UN  Environment  Programme
(UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

NOAA,  NASA,  U.S.  Navy  and  U.S.  Air  Force  jointly  support  the  Joint  Center  for
Satellite  Data  Assimilation  (JCSDA)  which  seeks  to  accelerate  and  improve  the
quantitative  use  of  research  and  operational  satellite  data  in  weather  and  climate
prediction  models.  Recent  successes  have  been  based  on  data  from  a  number  of
NASA  satellites,  including  QuikSCAT,  TRMM,  Terra  and  Aqua.  Through  the
JCSDA, inclusion of NASA data on sea winds, rainfall, high latitude winds and tem-
perature  and  humidity  vertical  profiles  in  NOAA  forecast  models  has  led  to  im-
proved  NOAA  weather  forecast  models,  including  short-term,  hurricane  and  sea-
sonal-to-inter-annual  forecasts.  The  JCSDA  helps  to  transform  NASA’s  results  into
NOAA’s operational systems and we are working together to ensure that each agen-
cy’s models are sufficiently similar to allow for easy movement of progress from one
to the other.

NASA  and  NOAA  have  also  worked  together  to  improve  weather  prediction  on
Earth  Through  a  long-standing  relationship  where  NASA  acts  as  a  program  man-
ager  and  purchasing  agent  on  NOAA’s  behalf.  This  relationship  in  developing,
launching, and operating the GOES and POES satellites has provided invaluable in-
formation  used  every  day  to  forecast  the  weather,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  across  the
world.  The  launch  of  NASA-built  NOAA  N  later  this  year  will  provide  new  short-
and long-range forecasting capabilities.

In 1970, NASA’s Nimbus–4 satellite led to the first measurements of global ozone
content  from  space.  Beginning  with  the  Nimbus–7  in  1979,  NASA  and  NOAA  have
harnessed  this  capability  through  the  Total  Ozone  Mapping  Spectrometers  (TOMS)
and  the  Solar  Backscatter  Ultraviolet  (SBUV)  instruments  to  produce  a  continuous
25-year data record of global ozone. The resulting long-term data set has been a cen-
tral  part  of  international  assessments  of  the  state  of  the  ozone  layer,  showing  both
the  global  picture  and  trend  of  ozone  loss  and  the  progress  of  the  Antarctic  ozone
hole.  The  continued  data  from  this  series  of  satellites  will  also  play  a  key  role  in
the observation of the recovery of the ozone layer. To interweave data from this se-

ries of satellite instruments into a homogeneous climate-quality data record requires
the ongoing commitment of this interagency science team. This data record, and the
blending  of  diverse  strengths  to  analyze  and  verify  data,  continues  today  with  the
advanced ozone measurements being made by NASA’s Aura mission. This capability
will  transition  to  NPOESS,  with  the  first  flight  of  the  OMPS  instrument  suite
aboard the NASA NPP mission.

More  recently,  NASA  and  NOAA  have  begun  cooperating  on  missions  related  to
space  weather  and  its  effects  on  Earth.  Data  from  NASA  spacecraft  can  be  used  to
improve  the  NOAA  capability  to  predict  space  weather.  For  example,  NOAA  uses
data  from  NASA’s  solar  wind  monitoring  ACE  spacecraft  to  assist  in  predicting
space  weather.  New  NASA  instruments  will  continue  to  inform  the  process  needed
to further develop a robust operational capability to predict space weather. By work-
ing  together,  NASA  and  NOAA  are  jointly  able  to  answer  questions  of  interest  to
both  agencies:  ‘‘How  and  why  the  Sun  varies?’’;  ‘‘How  does  the  Earth  respond  to
solar  variability?’’;  and  ‘‘What  are  the  implications  of  solar  variability  and  the
Earth’s response?’’

Based  on  this  synergy  of  science  objectives  and  history  of  coordination  and  co-
operation, NASA has been working with NOAA to transition to a strategy that bet-
ter  leverages  our  respective  strengths  in  science  investigations  and  mission  oper-
ations.  NASA  believes  this  is  in  line  with  the  principles  of  good  and  efficient  man-
agement  of  public  funds  to  serve  our  nation  and  the  world.  It  is  our  intent  to  con-
tinue  to  work  with  NOAA  to  look  for  new  ways  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  these
transfers.  For  example,  both  agencies  have  jointly  funded  a  study  by  the  National
Academy  of  Sciences/National  Research  Council  Committee  on  NASA–NOAA  Tran-
sition  from  Research  to  Operations  (CONNTRO).  The  May  2003  final  report  was
called Satellite Observations of the Earth’s Environment, Accelerating the Transition
from Research to Operations. In addition, NASA and NOAA have established a Joint
Research  to  Operations  (R2O)  Working  Group  as  a  mechanism  for  joint  and  coordi-
nated  planning  on  transition  matters  pertaining  to  research  results,  ground  sys-
tems,  and  current  and  future  spacecraft  missions  in  preparation  for  discussions
within the National Science and Technology Council.
FY 2006 Budget

The  former  Earth  Science  Enterprise  and  the  Sun-Earth  Connection  theme  from
the  former  Space  Science  Enterprise  have  been  combined  to  form  the  new  Earth-
Sun  System  theme.  In  this  new  theme,  the  following  programs  can  be  traced  from
Earth  Science:  Earth  Systematic  Missions,  Applications  and  Earth  System  Path-
finders.

The  FY  2006  budget  supports  a  vibrant  and  effective  science  program  that  is  re-
sponsive  to  national  priorities.  The  overall  NASA  science  programs  budget  run-out
shows a 24 percent increase from FY 2006 through FY 2010, at which time science
will grow from 33 percent to approximately 38 percent of the NASA budget. NASA’s
Science  Mission  Directorate  continues  to  support  55  operational  missions,  26  mis-
sions  in  development  and  34  in  formulation.  There  are  16  Earth  Science  missions
presently  on  orbit  and  plans  to  launch  eight  more  Earth  Science  missions  between
2005 and 2010. Earth science missions in development include Cloudsat; the Cloud-
Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder (CALIPSO); the NPOESS Preparatory Project
(NPP);  the  Orbiting  Carbon  Observatory  (OCO);  and  the  Landsat  Data  Continuity
Mission  (LDMC).  In  addition,  the  following  Earth  science  missions  are  currently  in
formulation:  the  Ocean  Surface  Topography  Mission  (OSTM);  the  Global  Precipita-
tion  Mission  (GPM);  Glory;  Aquarius;  and  Hydros.  Additionally,  the  NOAA  reim-
bursable  missions  GOES–N,  –O,  and  –P  and  POES–N  and  –N’  are  in  development
and GOES–R is in formulation.

One  of  NASA’s  Strategic  Objectives  for  2005  and  beyond  is  to  advance  scientific
knowledge  of  the  Earth  system  through  space-based  observation,  assimilation  of
new  observations,  and  development  and  deployment  of  enabling  technologies,  sys-
tems,  and  capabilities  including  those  with  the  potential  to  improve  future  oper-
ational systems. The FY 2006 budget for NASA supports a highly effective program
of research and development of Earth Sciences, and plans are now being formulated
to continue this significant effort into the future.
Conclusion

The  integrated  view  of  Sun  and  Earth  as  a  system  is  reflected  in  our  strategic
roadmapping  approach  and  long-term  planning.  NASA’s  goal  is  to  continue  using
our  unique  view  from  space  to  study  the  Earth  system  and  improve  our  prediction
of the Earth system change. Through new space-based technology designed to mon-
itor  the  Earth  system,  NASA  will  provide  timely,  on-demand  data  and  analyses  to
users  for  scientific  research,  national  policy-making,  economic  growth,  natural  haz-

ard mitigation, and the exploration of other planets in this solar system and beyond.
NASA’s FY 2006 budget request supports a robust science and mission set to ensure
a  wealth  of  scientific  research  and  discovery  will  continue  well  into  the  future.
Through this approach we also recognize the emerging importance of understanding
the Earth-Sun system in enabling the achievement of the Vision and NASA’s explo-
ration mandate.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ALPHONSO V. DIAZ

Mr.  Alphonso  V.  Diaz  was  named  Associate  Administrator  for  NASA’s  Science
Mission  Directorate  on  August  8,  2004.  In  this  position,  he  is  responsible  for  the
management,  direction,  and  oversight  of  NASA’s  science  flight  programs,  mission
studies,  and  technology  development.  In  addition,  in  this  capacity,  he  is  the  des-
ignated Program Executive Officer for the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), the
Ames Research Center, and contract management of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
From  1996  to  2004,  Mr.  Diaz  was  at  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  where  he
served  as  Center  Director  from  1998  to  2004  and  as  Deputy  Director  from  1996  to
1998.  While  at  GSFC  he  was  responsible  for  planning,  organizing,  and  directing
NASA’s Earth science, space science, and technology programs assigned to the Cen-
ter. GSFC is engaged in developing and operating scientific spacecraft including the
Hubble  Space  Telescope  and  the  Earth  Observing  System.  The  Center  continues  to
seek excellence in science and technology as demonstrated by many discoveries and
advances in its history, from the first mapping of the Antarctic ozone hole to deter-
mining the very early structure of the universe.

From  1989  to  March  1996,  Mr.  Diaz  served  as  Deputy  Associate  Administrator
and Chief Engineer of the Office of Space Science (Code S) at NASA Headquarters.
In  that  capacity,  he  was  responsible  for  management  direction  and  oversight  of
space  science  flight  program  policy,  launch  vehicle  requirements,  technology  infu-
sion  requirements,  and  mission  study  reviews  and  assessments.  Mr.  Diaz  led  the
Agency  committee  charted  by  the  Administrator  to  study  proposals  related  to
science institutes and to provide recommendations for implementation. Prior key po-
sitions  with  NASA  include  Deputy  Associate  Administrator  for  the  former  Office  of
Space  Science  and  Applications  (OSSA),  Assistant  Associate  Administrator  for  Pro-
grams  within  OSSA,  and  Director  for  Strategic  Plans  and  Programs  for  Space  Sta-
tion.

Mr.  Diaz  began  his  career  at  NASA’s  Langley  Research  Center  as  a  NASA  Coop
Student in 1964. At Langley, he worked in a variety of technical management posi-
tions,  including  on  the  Viking  Project,  Gas  Chromatograph  Mass  Spectrometer
(GCMS).  This  scientific  instrument  was  the  first  to  analyze  the  surface  material  of
Mars  in  1976.  In  1979,  Mr.  Diaz  began  his  work  at  NASA  Headquarters,  where  he
served in a variety of positions. Aside from the positions mentioned above, Mr. Diaz
also has served as the International Solar-Polar Mission (now Ulysses Mission) Pro-
gram Manager, the Galileo Program Manager, Manager of Planetary Advanced Pro-
grams,  and  as  Deputy  Director  of  the  Solar  System  Exploration  Division.  He  later
served  as  Assistant  Associate  Administrator  for  Space  Station  within  OSSA,  man-
aging  all  activities  on  the  use  of  the  planned  Space  Station  for  scientific  research,
and  providing  strategic  planning  guidance  for  OSSA’s  overall  program  of  scientific
exploration.  Mr.  Diaz  received  three  Presidential  Rank  Awards;  two  as  Meritorious

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  BERRIEN  MOORE  III,  DIRECTOR,  INSTI-
TUTE FOR THE STUDY OF EARTH, OCEANS, AND SPACE, UNI-
VERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
Dr. MOORE. Thank you. Thank you Committee, Minority Member
Congressman  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you
for inviting me here to testify today.

My  name  is  Berrien  Moore,  and  I  am  a  professor  of  systems  re-
search  at  the  University  of  New  Hampshire.  I  appear  today  in  my
capacity as Co-Chair of the National Research Council’s Committee
on  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space:  A  Community  As-
sessment and a Strategy for the Future.

This  committee  came  into  being  in  response  to  requests  from
NASA,  NOAA,  and  the  USGS  to  begin  a  decadal  survey  of  Earth
sciences  and  applications  from  space.  That  committee’s  report,  the
final report, is due to be completed in late 2006.

The key tasks of the committee are to develop a consensus of the
top-level scientific questions that should provide the focus for Earth
and environmental observations for the period 2005 to 2020 and to
develop a prioritized list of recommended space programs, missions,
and supporting activities to address these questions.

I  would  like  now  to  just  simply  summarize  my  comments  more

informally.

What we have submitted today, or actually released yesterday, is
the  interim  report  of  the  committee.  Unfortunately,  I  don’t  think
that is the best title. It is the report that the committee was asked
to do, funded by the government and partnered by the community,
to  look  at  the  status  of  affairs  today,  because  if  we  are  to  try  to
set  a  decadal  survey  into  motion  to  talk  about  a  vision  for  2005,
but  really  in  reality  2010  to  2020,  we  need  to  see  where  we  are
today.

And  so  the  interim  report  is  essentially  a  status  of  the  bridge.
Al  Diaz  mentioned  quite  properly  that  NASA’s  history  in  Earth
science over the last 15 to 20 years is truly remarkable. So our past
up  to  the  present  is  of  enormous  strength.  And  I  concur,  having
had  this  morning  the  opportunity  to  look  at  the  road  maps  and  to
know  what  the  decadal  survey  is  doing,  as  we  think  about  the  pe-
riod 2010 to 2020, that there is a glorious opportunity that we have
to better understand this planet and to better serve the Nation and
the world.

However,  we  are  now  on  a  bridge  between  that  extraordinary
past  and  the  future.  And  there  is  concern  about  the  status  of  that
bridge. And that is the content of the interim report.

The concerns are in five areas.
For  a  variety  of  reasons,  there  have  been  a  significant  number
of  Earth  science  missions  that  have  been  delayed  or  descoped  or
canceled  or  terminated,  and  I  can  easily  understand  some  debate
about which of those verbs is most appropriate. But there has been
a  significant  impact  upon  a  set  of  Earth  science  missions  that  the
community had expected to come into existence.

Secondly,  part  of  the  strategy  of  dealing  with  this  challenge  has
been to move some of that capability from NASA to NOAA and put
it onto the NPOESS platform. There are concerns about that tran-
sition.  We  do  not  understand  fully  the  technological  issues  as  well
as the scientific.

I will return to that point in a moment.
Thirdly,  that  there  are—that  after  the  Global  Precipitation  Mis-
sion,  there  is  no  major  facility-class  mission  at  NASA  in  the  plan-
ning queue. This is the first time that I can remember, in the long
history  I  have  had  with  NASA,  to  see  that  there  is  essentially  an
end.  And  when  that  occurs,  it  has  an  impact  upon  the  technology
investments. If you do not have a robust mission queue leading out
into  the  future,  then  you  do  not  have  a  robust  technology  cue  to
support that.

The  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinders  are  an  extraordinary  op-
portunity  to  have  rapid  access  to  space  through  principal  investi-
gator-led  missions.  I  find  this  one  of  the  most  exciting  aspects  to
see the Earth sciences adopt the Explorer mission concept from the
space  sciences  and  to  have  incorporated  these  in  the  so-called
ESSP, the Earth System Science Pathfinders.

However,  because  of  budget  constraints  again,  these  missions
have  been  stretched  out  longer  and  longer.  I  think  the  theme  is
going to be ‘‘fly before I die’’ if we don’t bring these in. We are look-
ing  at  outwards  of  eight  and  10  years  to  fly  off  some  of  these  PI-
led missions.

Two final areas.
In this transfer of capability from NASA to NOAA, there are ex-
traordinary  opportunities  there.  But  there  are  some  very  real  con-
cerns. Take, for instance, we have had this wonderful success with
the  EOS  missions.  And  those  now  are  to  be  replaced,  in  part,  by
the operational NPOESS missions.

But  let  us  look  at  what  happens  to  the  information  that  comes
from  NPOESS.  It  flows  to  four  weather  centrals,  operational
weather  centrals.  There  is  no  science  central.  There  is  no  climate
central.  There  is  no  central  where  the  data  can  be  analyzed  care-
fully  and  repeatedly.  It  goes  to  four  operational  centers  that  have
enormously important but very significant time constraints for get-
ting the information out.

And  so  we  think  that,  in  one  of  our  recommendations,  we  need
to  look  at  this  and  ask:  Is  NPOESS  really  serving  the  scientific
community, and in particular, the climate part of that mission?

Finally,  when  you  have  a  constrained  budget,  or  a  budget  that
is falling, one of the hardest things in the world to do is to preserve
the  research  and  analysis.  This  is  particularly  true  when  many
times  you  have  built  the  research  and  analysis  part  of  the  budget
through a coupling with the major missions. The EOS is a good ex-
ample.  Research  and  analysis  in  the  Earth  sciences  was  enhanced
tremendously because of the close coupling with the Earth Observ-
ing System. That coupling is beginning to deteriorate as the Earth
Observing System begins to age.

I  would  like  to  compliment,  though,  Ghassem  Asrar,  who  has
done  everything  he  could—who  is  in  the  audience,  who  has  done
everything  he  could  to  preserve  that  research  and  analysis  line.
But  in  a  declining  budget,  this  becomes  the  first  of  many  difficul-
ties.

Let  me  conclude,  and  I  would  go  back  to  my  formal  testimony.
Taken together, these developments jeopardize U.S. leadership in
both  Earth  science  and  Earth  observations,  and  they  undermine

the vitality of the government-university-private sector partnership
that has made so many contributions to society.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today,  and

I am prepared to answer any questions that you have.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Moore follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BERRIEN MOORE III

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and Members of the Committee: thank
you  for  inviting  me  here  to  testify  today.  My  name  is  Berrien  Moore,  and  I  am  a
Professor of Systems Research at the University of New Hampshire. I appear today
in my capacity as Co-Chair of the National Research Council (NRC)’s Committee on
Earth Science and Applications from Space: A Community Assessment and Strategy
for the Future.

As you know the National Research Council is the unit of the National Academies
that is responsible for organizing independent advisory studies for the Federal Gov-
ernment on science and technology. In response to requests from NASA, NOAA, and
the USGS, the NRC has begun a ‘‘decadal survey’’ of Earth science and applications
from  space  which  is  due  to  be  completed  in  2006.  The  guiding  principle  for  the
study, which was developed in consultation with members of the Earth science com-
munity, is to set an agenda for Earth science and applications from space, including
everything  from  short-term  needs  for  information,  such  as  weather  warnings  for
protection of life and property, to longer-term scientific understanding that is essen-
tial for understanding our planet, how it supports and sustains life, and that under-
pins future societal applications.

The NRC has been conducting decadal strategy surveys in astronomy for four dec-
ades.  But  it  has  only  started  to  do  them  in  other  areas  fairly  recently.  This  is  the
first decadal survey in Earth science and applications from space.

Among the key tasks in the charge to the decadal survey committee is the request

to:

• Develop  a  consensus  of  the  top-level  scientific  questions  that  should  provide
the focus for Earth and environmental observations in the period 2005–2020;
and
• Develop a prioritized list of recommended space programs, missions, and sup-

porting activities to address these questions.

The  NRC  survey  committee  has  prepared  a  brief  interim  report,  which  I  am
pleased  to  be  able  to  summarize  today.  This  report  provides  an  early  examination
of  urgent  issues  that  require  attention  prior  to  publication  of  the  committee’s  final
report  in  the  second  half  of  2006.  A  copy  of  the  full  report  has  also  been  provided
for your use.

The  report  was  requested  by  the  sponsors  of  the  study  and  by  staff  members  of
the  Science  Committee.  The  report  also  responds,  in  part,  to  direction  in  the  FY
2005 appropriations bill that calls for ‘‘the National Academy’s Space Studies Board
to  conduct  a  thorough  review  of  the  science  that  NASA  is  proposing  to  undertake
under  the  space  exploration  initiative  and  to  develop  a  strategy  by  which  all  of
NASA’s  science  disciplines. . .can  make  adequate  progress  towards  their  estab-
lished goals, as well as providing balanced scientific research in addition to support
of the new initiative.’’

The  current  U.S.  civilian  Earth  observing  system  centers  on  the  environmental
satellites  operated  by  NOAA;  the  atmosphere-,  ocean-,  ice-,  and  land-observation
satellites  of  NASA’s  Earth  Observing  System  (EOS);  and  the  Landsat  satellites,
which are operated through a cooperative arrangement between NASA, NOAA, and
the  USGS.  Over  the  past  30  years,  NASA  and  NOAA  have  contributed  to  funda-
mental  advances  in  understanding  the  Earth  system  and  in  providing  a  variety  of
societal  benefits  through  their  international  leadership  in  Earth  observing  systems
from space. Today, this process of building understanding through increasingly pow-
erful observations and thereby expanding the basis for needed applications is at risk
of  collapse.  Although  NOAA  has  plans  to  modernize  and  refresh  its  weather  sat-
ellites, NASA has no plan to replace its EOS platforms after their nominal six-year
lifetimes  end  (beginning  with  the  end  of  the  Terra  satellite  mission  in  2005),  and
it  has  canceled,  scaled  back,  or  delayed  at  least  six  planned  missions,  including  a
Landsat continuity mission.

These decisions at NASA appear to be driven by a major shift in priorities as the
Agency  moves  to  implement  a  new  vision  for  space  exploration.  We  believe  this
change  in  priorities  jeopardizes  NASA’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  obligations  in  other  im-
portant presidential initiatives, such as the Climate Change Research Initiative and

33

the  subsequent  Climate  Change  Science  Program.  It  also  calls  into  question  future
U.S. leadership in the Global Earth Observing System of Systems, an international
effort  initiated  by  this  administration.  Indeed,  the  Nation’s  ability  to  pursue  a  vi-
sionary  space  exploration  agenda  depends  critically  on  our  success  in  applying
knowledge  of  the  Earth  to  maintain  economic  growth  and  security  on  our  home
planet.

Moreover,  a  substantial  reduction  in  NASA’s  Earth  observation  programs  today
will result in a loss of U.S. scientific and technical capacity, which will decrease the
competitiveness  of  the  United  States  internationally  for  years  to  come.  U.S.  leader-
ship  in  science,  technology  development,  and  societal  applications  depends  on  sus-
taining  competence  across  a  broad  range  of  scientific  and  engineering  disciplines
that include the Earth sciences.

The NRC’s interim report identifies a number of issues for NASA and NOAA that
require  immediate  attention  in  the  FY  2006  and  FY  2007  programs.  They  include
the following:

• The impact of canceling or delaying NASA missions,
• The  need  to  evaluate  plans  for  transferring  capabilities  from  some  canceled

or scaled-back NASA missions to the NOAA–DOD NPOESS satellites,

• The adequacy of the technological base for future missions,
• The  state  of  NASA  Research  and  Analysis  programs,  which  are  necessary  to
maximize  scientific  return  on  NASA  investments  in  Earth  science  and  to  re-
tain the intellectual base for future missions,

• The need to reinvigorate the Explorer missions program, and
• Near-term  steps  that  are  required  to  develop  a  sustained  and  robust  observ-
ing  system  from  space  that  provides  essential  baseline  climate  observations
and  create  a  climate  data  and  information  system  to  meet  the  challenge  of
production,  distribution  and  stewardship  of  climate  records  from  NPOESS
and other relevant observational platforms.

With regard to these issues, the committee recommends the following actions:

1. The  NASA  Global  Precipitation  Measurement  mission  should  be  launched
without further delays. This mission is an international effort to improve cli-
mate,  weather,  and  hydrological  predictions  through  more  accurate  and  fre-
quent precipitation measurements.

2. NASA  and  NOAA  should  complete  the  fabrication,  testing,  and  space  quali-
fication  of  the  GIFTS  (Geosynchronous  Imaging  Fourier  Transform  Spec-
trometer)  instrument  and  should  support  the  international  effort  to  launch
this  instrument  by  2008.  GIFTS  will  make  highly  detailed  measurements
from  geostationary  orbit  of  temperature  and  water  vapor  and  will  improve
the  prediction  of  severe  weather  conditions  as  well  as  the  range  of  global
weather forecasts.

3. NASA  and  NOAA  should  commission  three  independent  reviews,  to  be  com-
pleted  by  October  2005,  regarding  three  missions  or  instruments:  (a)  the
Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission,  which  has  been  endorsed  by  the  White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy and was planned by NASA to
continue  the  vital  record  of  Earth  land  imaging  after  Landsat–7,  which  is
currently  failing,  (b)  the  Glory  mission  to  measure  and  characterize  atmos-
pheric aerosols and solar irradiance, which is now canceled, but which NASA
had previously proposed to accelerate in response to the President’s Climate
Change  Science  Program,  and  (c)  the  suitability  of  the  instrumentation
planned for NPOESS to measure ocean winds and direction.
The guidelines for these reviews are set forth in the Interim report.

4. Mr.  Chairman,  we  also  recommend  that  NASA  significantly  expand  existing
technology  development  programs  to  ensure  that  new  enabling  technologies
for  critical  observational  capabilities  are  available  to  support  mission  starts
over  the  coming  decade.  One  of  the  problems  of  having  nothing  in  the  mis-
sion  queue  after  the  Global  Precipitation  Mission,  other  than  smaller,  prin-
cipal  investigator  led  explorer-class  missions,  is  that  focused  technology  de-
velopment  is  no  longer  supported.  Amongst  the  areas  requiring  increased
technology investments are:
• Space-based  interferometric  synthetic  aperture  radar,  whose  numerous
applications  include  monitoring  of  Earth’s  crustal  movements  caused  by
volcanic or seismic activity;

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

• Wide  swath  ocean  altimetry,  which  will  provide  the  first  synoptic  obser-
vations  of  global  ocean  eddies,  coastal  currents  and  tides,  and  internal
tides; and
• Wind lidar, which will facilitate long sought measurements of global wind
profiles,  particularly  over  the  oceans  where  three  dimensional  measure-
ments are sparse and where most weather phenomena originate.

5. We also recommend that NASA:

• Increase  the  frequency  of  Earth  Explorer  selection  opportunities  and  ac-
celerate  the  frequency  of  launch  opportunities  by  providing  sufficient
funding for at least one launch per year (that is, a return to the schedule
the  program  originally  envisioned  and  followed  prior  to  recent  delays),
and
• Release  the  next  announcement  of  opportunity  for  this  program  in  FY

2005.

NASA  developed  its  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  (ESSP)  program  as
‘‘an  innovative  approach  for  addressing  Global  Change  Research  by  pro-
viding periodic ’Windows of Opportunity’ to accommodate new scientific pri-
orities  and  infuse  new  scientific  participation  into  the  Earth  Science  Enter-
prise. . .[using]. . .relatively  low  to  moderate  cost,  small  to  medium  sized
missions that are capable of being built, tested and launched in a short time
interval.’’ But some of the missions now being planned may not be launched
until nearly 10 years after they were selected.

6. Last,  we  recommend  that  NOAA,  working  with  the  Climate  Change  Science
Program and the international Group on Earth Observations create a robust
and  sustained  observing  system  from  space  that  includes  at  a  minimum  a
set  of  essential  baseline  climate  observations.  In  addition  NOAA  should  cre-
ate a climate data and information system to meet the challenge of the pro-
duction,  distribution,  and  stewardship  of  high-accuracy  climate  records  from
NPOESS  and  other  relevant  observational  platforms.  These  functions  are
within  NOAA’s  mandate  to  understand  climate  variability  and  change,  but
cannot  be  accomplished  through  the  current  NPOESS  program  or  its  data
system architecture.

Finally,  Mr.  Chairman,  our  committee  is  also  concerned  about  diminished  re-
sources  for  the  research  and  analysis  (R&A)  programs  that  sustain  the  interpreta-
tion  of  Earth  science  data.  Because  the  R&A  programs  are  carried  out  largely
through  the  Nation’s  research  universities,  there  will  be  an  immediate  and  delete-
rious  impact  on  graduate  student,  postdoctoral,  and  faculty  research  support.  The
long-term  consequence  will  be  a  diminished  ability  to  attract  and  retain  students
interested in using and developing Earth observations. Taken together, these devel-
opments  jeopardize  U.S.  leadership  in  both  Earth  science  and  Earth  observations,
and  they  undermine  the  vitality  of  the  government-university-private  sector  part-
nership that has made so many contributions to society.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  I  am  prepared  to  an-

swer any questions that you may have.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you, Dr. Moore.
Dr. Killeen.

STATEMENT OF DR. TIMOTHY L. KILLEEN, DIRECTOR,

NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH

Dr. KILLEEN. Good morning.
I  thank  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  and  the
other Members of the Committee for the opportunity to speak with
you today about NASA’s role in the Earth sciences.

My name is Tim Killeen. I am the Director of the National Cen-
ter for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, which is sponsored by the
National Science Foundation, and the President-Elect of the Amer-
ican Geophysical Union.

I  am  a  space  scientist  who  has  built  hardware  for  NASA  in  the
past  and  a  former  professor  at  the  University  of  Michigan  where
I taught Earth system sciences for many years.

I would like to make three simple points today.
First,  NASA  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  country’s  vibrant  Earth
sciences  program.  Decisions  about  NASA  priorities  and  funding  on
Earth  science  can  accelerate  or  impede  progress  in  this  vitally  im-
portant field.

Second,  rapid  advances  in  NASA  Earth  observing  capabilities,
when  coupled  with  the  acceleration  of  modeling  and  information
technologies,  have  positioned  us  on  the  brink  of  an  extraordinary
new  era  in  Earth  science  research,  one  in  which  we  can  quan-
titatively  understand  and  predict  the  Earth  as  a  system  with  tre-
mendous societal and economic benefits.

Third,  the  importance  of  Earth  science  and  the  central  role  of
NASA  argue  for  careful,  thorough,  and  deliberative  assessment  to
inform program planning, especially when major changes are being
considered.  In  my  opinion,  the  current  pace  of  budgetary  and  pro-
gram  change  at  NASA  is  inconsistent  with  such  an  approach  and
could result in irrevocable damage to programs and scientific teams
that have taken decades and billions of tax dollars to build.

If I could have the first slide, please.
It  is  clear  after  many  years  of  pioneering  satellite  observations
that Earth is a system of tightly coupled parts that interact in com-
plex ways to produce the whole. For me personally, this ‘‘blue mar-
ble’’  photograph  taken  over  30  years  ago  by  Apollo  17  astronauts
on the way to the Moon symbolizes this complex system. It has be-
come a societal icon.

The  study  of  such  interactions  has,  in  fact,  become  known  as
Earth  system  science  and  has  led  to  numerous  insights  about  how
the Earth functions and how it is evolving and changing over time.
To  understand,  for  example,  how  the  atmosphere  supports  and
protects  life,  one  must  appreciate  the  complex  and  tightly-coupled
circulation dynamics, chemistry, interactions with the oceans, with
ice,  with  biosphere  and  land  surface,  all  driven  by  solar  radiation.
And  the  natural  system  that  we  live  on—live  in  is  susceptible  to
changes  due  to  human  activity,  creating  still  more  complexity  and
variability.  We  must  strive  to  understand  and  predict  such  varia-
bility in order to safeguard and manage human societies.

Earth  system  science,  informed  by  comprehensive  and  accurate

ground- and space-based observations, is the tool kit for this.

Let  me  provide  you  with  a  single  example  of  what  I  am  talking

about.

Just last week, President Bush mentioned proposed rules to limit

air pollution from power plants.

The next slide, please.
These  animations  were  the  first  NASA-produced  global  observa-
tions  of  air  pollution  moving  around  the  globe.  Sources  of  carbon
monoxide  seen  here  include  industrial  processes.  See,  for  example,
the  source  regions  in  the  Pacific  Rim,  and  fires,  look  at  Amazonia.
This  global-scale  data  from  space,  thanks  to  NASA’s  commitment
to  research  and  innovation,  has  helped  transform  our  under-
standing  of  the  relationship  of  pollution  and  air  quality.  We  now
know  that  pollution  is  not  solely,  or  even  primarily,  a  local  or  re-
gional  problem.  California’s  air  quality,  for  example,  is  clearly  in-
fluenced by industrial activity in Asia.

NASA  Earth  observation  capabilities,  such  as  these,  thank  you,
coupled  with  the  Agency’s  strong  support  for  modeling  and  sci-
entific  research  and  analysis,  have  been  essential  to  the  advance-
ment of Earth system science. It is very important to maintain this
balance within the NASA program both because research and anal-
ysis  is  the  process  by  which  useful  information  is  derived  from  re-
mote sensing systems and because university-based research activi-
ties  produce  and  nurture  the  human  capital  that  provides  a  foun-
dation for the entire space program.

In this slide, the effect of funding reaches far beyond the year in

which they occur.

Advanced Earth observations and modeling, I assert, will lead di-
rectly to major societal benefits to the country, including improved
national  security,  weather  forecasts  and  warnings,  climate  out-
looks,  management  of  natural  resources,  including  water,  agri-
culture,  and  energy,  and  mitigation  of  natural  disasters,  such  as
droughts, floods, landslides, and volcanic eruptions.

I fully understand that NASA faces many difficult choices arising
from pursuit of ambitious goals in a period of national budget con-
straints.  However,  I  believe  it  is  important  to  proceed  carefully
when  making  decisions  regarding  key  national  assets  and  pro-
grams  such  as  these.  Understanding  the  complex,  changing  planet
upon which we live, how it supports life, and how human activities
will  affect  its  ability  to  support  life  into  the  future  is  one  of  the
greatest intellectual and practical challenges facing humanity.

I  urge  the  Members  of  the  Committee  to  do  all  that  is  possible
to  protect  and  help  to  manage,  in  a  thoughtful  and  strategic  man-
ner, the critically valuable scientific infrastructure and human cap-
ital that are unique to the NASA Earth Science program.

And  I  thank  the  Chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member,  in  par-

ticular, for the opening comments.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY L. KILLEEN

I thank Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon, and the other Members of
the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  on  NASA’s  role  in  the
Earth Sciences. My name is Tim Killeen, and I am the Director of the National Cen-
ter  for  Atmospheric  Research  (NCAR),  which  is  sponsored  by  the  National  Science
Foundation.  I  am  also  the  President-Elect  of  the  American  Geophysical  Union
(AGU). My academic background is as an experimental space scientist who has par-
ticipated  in  several  NASA  space  science  programs  and  a  former  professor  at  the
University  of  Michigan,  where  I  taught  atmospheric,  space,  and  Earth  system
sciences for many years.

The topic of this hearing is of tremendous importance to our understanding of the
planet on which we live. I would like to make three fundamental points today, using
examples of past and future contributions by NASA to the study of Earth:

• First, NASA plays a crucial role in this country’s vibrant Earth sciences pro-
gram.  NASA  is  the  dominant  federal  funding  agency  for  U.S.  scientists  and
engineers who address fundamental questions about our planet, provide prac-
tical  knowledge  about  the  way  the  Earth  functions,  and  reveal  how  human
activities  affect  the  environment  upon  which  all  life  depends.  NASA  funding
for Earth science provides the intellectual capital and scientific infrastructure
to  produce  work  that  is  not  just  intellectually  exciting  but  critical  to  human
existence.
• Second,  rapid  advances  in  NASA  Earth  observing  capabilities,  coupled  with
revolutionary  advances  in  information  technology,  have  positioned  us  for  an
extraordinary new era in Earth science research—one in which we can quan-
titatively  understand  and  predict  the  Earth  as  a  system,  with  the  temporal

37

and  spatial  fidelity  needed  by  decision-makers  at  many  levels  of  our  society:
local, regional, and global. This will lead directly to major societal benefits in-
cluding:

Æ improved national security
Æ better weather forecasts and warnings
Æ more targeted climate outlooks
Æ better management of natural resources including water, agriculture, and

energy

Æ more  effective  mitigation  of  natural  disasters  such  as  drought,  floods,

landslides, and volcanic eruptions.

• Third,  the  importance  of  Earth  science  and  the  central  role  of  NASA  in  this
field  argue  for  careful,  thorough,  and  deliberative  assessment  to  inform  pro-
gram planning, especially when major changes are being considered. The cur-
rent  pace  of  budgetary  and  program  change  in  NASA  is  inconsistent  with
such an approach and could result in irrevocable damage to programs and sci-
entific teams that have taken decades and billions of tax dollars to build.

I fully understand that NASA faces many difficult choices arising from the pursuit
of  ambitious  goals  in  a  period  of  national  budget  constraints.  However,  I  believe  it
important to proceed carefully when making decisions regarding important national
assets  and  programs  such  as  those  represented  within  the  NASA  Earth  Science  ef-
fort.
A. The Importance of Earth Science and NASA’s Role

It is clear after decades of pioneering satellite observations that Earth is a system
of  tightly  coupled  parts  that  interact  in  complex  ways  to  produce  the  whole.  The
study  of  such  interactions  has  become  known  as  Earth  system  science,  and  has  led
to  numerous  insights  about  how  the  Earth  functions  and  how  it  is  evolving  and
changing  over  time.  To  understand  how  the  atmosphere  supports  and  protects  life,
for  example,  one  must  appreciate  the  complex  and  tightly  coupled  circulation  dy-
namics, chemistry, interactions with the oceans, ice, biosphere, and land surface: all
driven  by  solar  radiation.  And  today,  the  natural  system  is  clearly  susceptible  to
changes  due  to  human  activity,  creating  still  more  complexity  and  variability  over
many  scales  of  time  and  space.  In  any  foreseeable  future,  we  will  have  to  under-
stand  this  ‘‘system  of  systems’’  in  order  to  help  create,  maintain,  safeguard,  and
guide human societies. Earth system science, based on comprehensive and accurate
ground- and space-based observations, is the toolkit that enables such investigation.
Furthermore, the manner in which we explore other worlds will be informed by the
understanding of our own.

For  me  personally,  this  ‘‘blue  marble’’  photograph  taken  over  30  years  ago  by
Apollo 17 astronauts on the way to the Moon perfectly represents this complex sys-
tem. You have all seen this incredible picture hundreds of times in advertisements,
reports and public media. It is perhaps one of the most significant, but under-sung,
societal icons we possess. At NCAR, it is featured in a wall mural.

There  are  many  ways  to  illustrate  the  importance  of  NASA’s  role  in  supporting
Earth system science in the U.S. In sheer budgetary terms, NASA is the single larg-
est environmental science program supported by the Federal Government. The wide-
ly  respected  budget  analyses  of  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of
Science (AAAS) indicate that NASA provided 34 percent of the total funding for the
environmental sciences in 2004. Much of this spending is devoted to the design, de-
velopment,  and  operation  of  scientific  instruments,  the  spacecraft  that  carry  them,
and  the  data  systems  required  to  process,  analyze,  archive,  and  distribute  data  to
the  scientific  community  and  other  users.  But  it  should  also  be  remembered  that
NASA  provides  significant  resources  to  university  investigators  through  the  re-
search and analysis component of its program.

In fact, leaving spacecraft and data system costs aside, AAAS analyses show that
NASA  was  the  third  largest  provider  of  competitively  awarded  extramural  funding
for  the  university  environmental  science  community  in  2004,  trailing  only  the  Na-
tional Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Even small reduc-
tions  in  the  NASA  program  have  large  effects  in  the  university  community.  This
matters both because research and analysis is the process by which useful informa-

39

tion is derived from remote sensing systems, and because university-based research
activities  provide  the  human  capital  (undergraduates,  graduate  students,  young  re-
searchers  and  engineers)  that  underpins  the  entire  space  program.  The  effects  of
funding  perturbations  reach  far  beyond  the  year  in  which  they  occur.  The  design
and development of an Earth observation satellite takes a decade or more, and keep-
ing  young  scientists  and  engineers  engaged  in  such  work  requires  some  degree  of
steady ongoing support.

Another way of showing NASA’s importance to this field is by looking at what has
been  accomplished.  The  scientific  and  practical  results  from  NASA’s  Earth  science
program  are  much  too  extensive  for  me  to  catalogue  here,  but  two  examples  can  il-
lustrate  the  unique  contribution  that  NASA  has  made  to  our  understanding  of  the
Earth’s atmosphere and its variations.
Example 1: Ozone depletions

The  first  example  is  probably  well  known  to  you.  The  ozone  ‘‘holes’’  in  the  Ant-
arctic and Arctic were monitored from space by various NASA satellite systems, in-
cluding the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). The diagnosis of the phys-
ical  and  chemical  mechanisms  responsible  for  these  dangerous  changes  to  our  pro-
tective  ozone  shield  was  made  possible  by  the  combination  of  observations,  mod-
eling, and theory supported by NASA. In fact, it was a NASA high-altitude aircraft
that made the ‘‘smoking gun’’ measurements that convinced the scientific and policy
communities  that  chlorine  compounds  produced  by  various  human  activities  were
centrally  responsible  for  the  observed  ozone  loss.  Following  these  observations,
international protocols were put in place that are beginning to ameliorate the glob-
al-scale  ozone  loss.  The  TOMS  instrument  has  provided  an  ongoing  source  of  data
that  permits  us  to  track  the  level  of  ozone  in  the  stratosphere,  the  annual  opening
and  closing  of  the  ‘‘ozone  hole,’’  and  how  this  phenomenon  is  changing  over  time.
These continuing measurements and analyses and the effective regulatory response
have  led,  among  other  things,  to  a  reduction  in  projected  deaths  from  skin  cancer
worldwide.
Example 2: Air Pollution Observations

Last  week,  President  Bush  mentioned  proposed  rules  to  limit  air  pollution  from
coal-fired  power  plants.  Air  pollution  is  clearly  an  important  concern.  NASA  has
played  a  major  role  in  the  development  of  new  technologies  that  can  monitor  the
sources  and  circulation  patterns  of  air  pollution  globally.  It  is  another  tremendous
story  of  science  serving  society  through  innovation.  In  this  case,  through  an  inter-
national  collaboration,  NASA  deployed  a  one-of-a-kind  instrument  designed  to  ob-
serve  global  carbon  monoxide  and  its  transport  from  the  NASA  Terra  spacecraft.
These animations show the first global observations of air pollution. Sources of car-
bon  monoxide  include  industrial  processes  (see,  for  example,  source  regions  in  the
Pacific Rim) and fires (for example in Amazonia). These global-scale data from space
have helped change our understanding of the relationship between pollution and air
quality—we  now  know  that  pollution  is  not  solely  or  even  primarily  a  local  or  re-
gional  problem.  California’s  air  quality  is  influenced  by  industrial  activity  in  Asia,
and Europe’s air quality is influenced by activities here in America.

40

From  such  pioneering  work,  operational  systems  can  now  be  designed  to  observe
pollution  events,  the  global  distribution  of  chemicals  and  particulate  matter  in  the
atmosphere,  and  the  ways  in  which  these  substances  interact  and  affect  the  ability
of  the  atmosphere  to  sustain  life—such  a  system  will  undoubtedly  underpin  future
efforts  to  understand,  monitor,  and  manage  air  quality  globally.  Without  NASA’s
commitment  to  innovation  in  the  Earth  sciences,  it  is  hard  to  believe  that  such  an
incredible new capability would be available today.
B. The Promise of Earth Observations in the Next Decade

The  achievements  of  the  last  several  decades  have  laid  the  foundation  for  an  un-
precedented  era  of  discovery  and  innovation  in  Earth  system  science.  Advances  in
observing  technologies  have  been  accompanied  by  vast  improvements  in  computing
and  data  processing.  When  the  Earth  Observing  System  satellites  were  being  de-
signed,  processing  and  archiving  the  data  was  a  central  challenge.  The  Terra  sat-
ellite  produces  about  194  gigabytes  of  raw  data  per  day,  which  seemed  a  daunting
prospect  at  the  time  of  its  definition.  Now  laptop  memories  are  measured  in
gigabytes,  students  can  work  with  remote  sensing  data  sets  on  their  laptops,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

41

a large data center like NCAR increases our data holdings by about 1,000 gigabytes
per day. The next generation of high performance computing systems, which will be
deployed  during  the  next  five  years  or  so,  will  be  petascale  systems,  meaning  that
they will be able to process millions of gigabytes of data. The ongoing revolution in
information  technology  has  provided  us  with  capabilities  we  could  hardly  conceive
of  when  the  current  generation  of  Earth  observing  satellites  was  being  developed.
We have just begun to take advantage of the synergies between these technological
areas.  The  U.S.,  through  NASA,  is  uniquely  positioned  to  take  advantage  of  this
technological opportunity.
Example 3: Weather Forecasting

Weather forecasting in the Southern Hemisphere has been dramatically improved
through  NASA’s  contributions,  and  this  experience  illustrates  the  power  of  remote
sensing  for  further  global  improvements  in  weather  prediction.  The  lack  of  surface-
based data in the Southern Hemisphere once meant that predictive skill lagged con-
siderably  behind  that  achieved  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  The  improvement  in
the  accuracy  of  Southern  Hemisphere  weather  forecasting  is  well  documented  and
almost  entirely  due  to  the  increased  use  of  remote-sensing  data.  But  improvements
in  the  quality  of  satellite  data  were  not  sufficient.  Improvements  in  data  assimila-
tion—a  family  of  techniques  for  integrating  observational  results  into  predictive
models—were  also  necessary.  The  combination  has  resulted  in  rapid  improvement
in Southern Hemisphere forecasting, which is now nearly equal to that in northern
regions. Data assimilation capabilities continue to advance rapidly.

One can now easily conceive of forecast systems that will fuse data from satellites,
ground-based  systems,  databases,  and  models  to  provide  predictions  with  unprece-
dented detail and accuracy—perhaps reaching natural limits of predictability. A new
generation of weather forecast models with cloud-resolving spatial resolution is com-
ing  online,  and  these  models  show  significant  promise  for  improving  forecast  skills
across  the  board.  Use  of  new  NASA  remote  sensing  data  from  upcoming  missions
such as Calipso (Cloud-Aerosol and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite) and CloudSat will
be  essential  to  fully  validate  and  tune  these  new  capabilities  which  will  serve  the
Nation in providing improved hurricane and severe storm prediction, and in the de-
velopment  of  numerous  decision  support  systems  reliant  on  state-of-the-art  numer-
ical weather prediction capabilities.
Example 4: Earth System Models

from  MODIS 

Data from NASA missions are central to constructing more comprehensive and de-
tailed models that will more realistically represent the complexity of the Earth sys-
tem.  Cloud  observations 
(the  Moderate  Resolution  Imaging
Spectroradiometer)  and  precipitation  measurements  from  GPM  (the  Global  Precipi-
tation  Mission),  for  example,  are  critical  to  improving  the  representation  of  clouds
and  the  water  cycle  in  such  models.  Observations  from  MODIS  and  Landsat  are
fundamental to the development of more sophisticated representation of marine and
terrestrial  ecosystems  and  atmosphere-land  surface  interactions.  The  inclusion  of
this  detail  will  help  in  the  creation  of  true  Earth  system  models  that  will  enable
detailed investigation of the interactions of Earth system processes and multiple en-
vironmental stresses within physically consistent simulated systems.

In  general  terms,  Earth  system  observations  represent  the  only  means  of  vali-
dating Earth system model predictions. Our confidence in short-term, regional-scale
weather  predictions  is  based  on  how  closely  they  match  observed  regional  condi-
tions. Assessing the performance of global-scale, longer-term model predictions like-
wise depends on comparing model results with observational records. Scientific con-
fidence  in  the  ability  of  general  circulation  models  to  represent  Earth’s  climate  has
been greatly enhanced by comparing model results for the last century with the ob-
servational  records  from  that  period.  At  the  same  time,  the  sparse  and  uneven  na-
ture of past observational records is an ongoing source of uncertainty in the evalua-
tion  of  model  results.  The  existence  of  much  more  comprehensive  and  consistent
global  measurements  from  space—such  as  the  data  from  the  NASA  Terra,  Aqua,
and Aura satellites—is a giant step forward in this regard, and, if maintained, will
enable much more rigorous evaluation of model performance in the future.

In  summary,  Earth  system  models,  with  increasing  temporal  and  spatial  resolu-
tions  and  validated  predictive  capabilities,  will  be  used  by  industry  and  govern-
mental  decision-makers  across  a  host  of  domains  into  the  foreseeable  future.  This
knowledge  base  will  drive  new  economies  and  efficiencies  within  our  society.  I  be-
lieve  that  requirements  flowing  from  the  needs  and  capabilities  of  sophisticated
Earth system models will be very useful for NASA in developing strategic roadmaps
for future missions.

C. The Importance of Careful Planning

42

The  central  role  of  NASA  in  supporting  Earth  system  science,  the  demonstrated
success and impact of previous and current NASA missions, and the promise of con-
tinued  advances  in  scientific  understanding  and  societal  benefits  all  argue  for  a
careful,  analytical  approach  to  major  modifications  in  the  NASA  Earth  science  pro-
gram.

As  noted  above,  the  development  of  space  systems  is  a  time-consuming  and  dif-
ficult  process.  Today’s  actions  and  plans  will  have  long-term  consequences  for  our
nation’s capabilities in this area.

The  link  between  plans  and  actions  is  one  of  the  most  important  points  I  want
to  address  today.  From  the  outside,  the  interagency  planning  process  seems  to  be
experiencing  substantial  difficulties  in  maintaining  this  link.  The  NASA  Earth
science  program  is  part  of  two  major  Presidential  initiatives,  the  Climate  Change
Science  Program  (CCSP)  and  the  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems
(GEOSS). With regard to the CCSP, it is not apparent that the strategies and plans
developed  through  the  interagency  process  are  having  much  impact  on  NASA  deci-
sion-making.  In  January  2004,  then-Administrator  of  NASA,  Sean  O’Keefe,  called
for  acceleration  of  the  NASA  Glory  mission  because  of  the  direct  relevance  of  the
mission  to  understanding  the  roles  of  aerosols  in  the  climate  system,  which  is  one
of  the  highest-priority  science  questions  defined  in  the  CCSP  research  strategy.
NASA is now proposing cancellation of the mission. As I have emphasized through-
out this testimony, the progress of and benefits from Earth system science research
are  contingent  upon  close  coordination  between  research,  modeling,  and  observa-
tions.  The  close  coordination  of  program  planning  among  the  agencies  that  support
these activities is also a necessity. This coordination currently appears to be fragile.
The  effect  of  significant  redirections  in  NASA  and  reduction  in  NASA’s  Earth
science effort are equally worrisome in the case of the Administration’s GEOSS ini-
tiative,  which  is  focused  on  improving  the  international  coordination  of  environ-
mental  observing  systems.  Both  NASA  and  NOAA  satellite  programs  are  vital  to
this  effort.  The  science  community  is  very  supportive  of  the  GEOSS  concept  and
goals.  There  are  over  100  space-based  remote-sensing  systems  that  are  either  oper-
ating or planned by various nations for the next decade. Collaboration among space
systems,  between  space-  and  ground-based  systems,  and  between  suppliers  and
users of observational data is critical to avoiding duplication of effort and to getting
the  most  out  of  the  investments  in  observing  technology.  The  tragic  example  of  the
Indian  Ocean  Tsunami  demonstrates  the  need  for  such  coordination.  The  tsunami
was  detected  and  observed  before  hitting  land,  but  the  absence  of  effective  commu-
nication  links  prevented  warnings  from  reaching  those  who  needed  them  in  time.
A functioning GEOSS could lead to major improvements in the rapid availability of
data  and  warnings,  and  the  U.S.  is  right  to  make  development  of  such  a  system  a
priority. But U.S. credibility and leadership of this initiative will be called into ques-
tion  if  our  nation  is  unable  or  unwilling  to  coordinate  and  maintain  the  U.S.  pro-
grams that make up the core of our proposed contribution.
D. Answers to Questions Posed by the Committee

My  testimony  to  this  point  has  outlined  my  views  on  a  series  of  key  issues  for
the  NASA  Earth  science  program.  Much  of  the  text  found  above  is  relevant  to  con-
sideration of the specific questions posed by the Committee in its letter of invitation.
In  this  section,  I  provide  more  direct  answers  to  these  questions  to  the  extent  pos-
sible and appropriate.
How  should  NASA  prioritize  currently  planned  and  future  missions?  What
criteria should NASA use in doing so?

I believe that NASA should work with the scientific and technical community and
its  partner  agencies  to  define  a  NASA  Earth  science  plan  that  is  fully  compatible
with  the  overall  CCSP  and  GEOSS  science  strategies.  In  my  view,  the  interaction
with the scientific and technical community should include both input from and re-
view by the National Research Council (NRC) and direct interaction with the strong
national  community  of  Earth  science  investigators  and  the  aerospace  industry  who
are very familiar with NASA capabilities and developing technological opportunities.
Competitive  peer  review  processes  should  be  used  appropriately  in  assessing  the
merit  of  competing  approaches  and  in  key  decision-making.  I  believe  NASA  should
also  find  a  means  of  involving  users  and  potential  users  of  NASA-generated  data
in  this  process,  perhaps  through  public  comment  periods  or  a  series  of  workshops.
Sufficient time should be allotted to this process for a careful and deliberative eval-
uation of options. This science plan should then guide the process of setting mission
priorities.

Defining criteria to use in comparing and deciding upon potential missions would
be  an  important  part  of  this  planning  exercise.  I  would  recommend  consideration
of a set of criteria that include:

• compatibility  with  science  priorities  in  the  CCSP  and  GEOSS  science  plans
• potential scientific return from mission
• technological risk
• direct and indirect societal benefits
• cost.

I  believe  that  the  decadal  planning  activity  underway  at  the  NRC  in  response  to

a request from NASA and NOAA is a valuable step in this process.
What  are  the  highest  priority  unaddressed  or  unanswered  questions  in
Earth science observations from space?

I  believe  this  question  is  most  appropriately  addressed  through  the  community
process  suggested  above.  There  are  many  important  Earth  science  questions,  and
prioritizing among them is best done in a deliberative and transparent process that
involves extensive input from and discussion by the science community. I would per-
sonally  cite  soil  moisture,  three-dimensional  cloud  characteristics,  global  vector  tro-
pospheric  winds,  pollutant  characteristics  and  transport,  carbon  fluxes,  and  aerosol
distributions as all high priority measurements to make on a global scale.
What  have  been  the  most  important  contributions  to  society  that  have
come from NASA Earth sciences over the last decade (or two)?

NASA  Earth  science  programs  have  played  a  key  role  in  developing  our  under-
standing  of  the  Earth  as  a  coupled  system  of  inter-related  parts,  and  in  the  identi-
fication and documentation of a series of global-scale changes in the Earth’s environ-
ment,  including  ozone  depletion,  land  use  and  land  cover  change,  loss  of  biodiver-
sity, and climate change. Other examples of societal contributions include improved
weather  forecasting,  improved  understanding  of  the  large-scale  climate  variations,
such  as  the  El  Nin˜ o-Southern  Oscillation  and  the  North  Atlantic  Oscillation  that
alter seasonal patterns of rainfall, and improved understanding of the status of and
changes  in  marine  and  terrestrial  ecosystems  that  contributes  to  more  effective
management of natural resources.
What future benefits to the Nation (societal applications) are possible that
NASA Earth sciences could provide? What gaps in our knowledge must we
fill before those future benefits are possible?

In  a  broad  sense,  NASA  Earth  science  activities  are  part  of  developing  a  global
Earth information system that can provide ongoing and accurate information about
the  status  of  and  changes  in  the  atmosphere,  oceans,  and  marine  and  terrestrial
ecosystems  that  sustain  life,  including  the  impact  of  human  activities.  The  contin-
ued  development  of  observation  systems,  sophisticated  Earth  system  models,  data
assimilation  methods,  and  information  technologies  holds  the  promise  of  much  im-
proved  predictions  of  weather  and  climate  variations  and  much  more  effective  pre-
diction and warning of natural hazards. Much has already been accomplished to lay
the  groundwork  for  such  a  system,  but  many  important  questions  remain.  Some  of
the  most  important  have  to  do  with  the  functioning  and  human  alteration  of  the
Earth’s  carbon,  nitrogen,  and  water  cycles,  and  how  these  cycles  interact;  the  re-
gional manifestation of global scale climate change; and the reactions of ecosystems
to simultaneous multiple stresses.

Summary

In  closing,  I  hope  that  my  short  list  of  examples  suffices  to  emphasize  the  fact
that  it  is  not  possible  to  conceive  of  a  vigorous  and  healthy  Earth  system  science
effort  in  the  United  States  without  a  strong  ongoing  NASA  program.  The  scientific
community is in the initial stages of a knowledge revolution enabled by the vast in-
creases  in  the  capabilities  of,  and  synergy  between,  observation  and  information
technologies. The advances in Earth system science that are being enabled by these
capabilities are critical for understanding the Earth system and how it is changing.
Such  understanding  is  an  important  contribution  to  natural  resource  management,
natural-hazard  mitigation,  and  sustainable  economic  growth.  I  understand  that
NASA  faces  many  difficult  choices  arising  from  pursuit  of  ambitious  goals  in  a  pe-
riod of budget constraints, but I urge you to take account of the unique and central
role  of  NASA  observing  programs  in  our  nation’s  climate,  weather,  and  Earth  sys-
tem science efforts as you oversee development of the plans and strategies that will
guide NASA in the coming decade and beyond.

today.

principal  investigator  for  one  of  NASA’s  missions  to  explore  an-
other planet.

Five years ago, I was asked by Ghassem Asrar, in this audience,
to chair a working group to guide the science community in the de-
velopment  of  a  long-term  vision  for  solid  Earth  science  at  NASA.
And  over  two  years,  our  group  deliberated.  We  gathered  advice,
and  in  2002,  we  published  our  recommendations.  That  effort  of
ours  served  as  a  microcosm  for  the  Earth  science  decadal  survey
indeed for the challenge NASA now faces as it integrates top prior-
ities across all of its programs.

Today,  I  would  like  to  summarize  the  criteria  that  our  group
used to prepare that strategy, the most important questions we felt
should  guide  NASA’s  programs  and  solid  Earth  science  and  most
critical  mission  opportunities  that  our  group  recommended  NASA
pursue.

The  surface  of  the  Earth,  of  course,  is  where  we  live.  Though
largely  solid,  the  interior  of  the  Earth  is  far  from  static.  The
Earth’s  internal  motions  and  interactions  of  the  solid  Earth  with
the  atmosphere  and  the  hydrosphere  and  the  oceans  continually
change  our  planet’s  surface.  And  some  of  those  changes  occur  very
slowly,  but  some  are,  indeed,  catastrophic:  earthquakes,  volcanic
eruptions, landslides, floods, tsunamis, and other natural disasters.

If I could have the first view graph.
We  understand  the  workings  of  the  Earth,  particularly  the  solid
Earth,  are  linked  through  the  notion  of  plate  tectonics  that  the
outer layer of the Earth is divided into rigid plates that are in rel-
ative  motion  and  interact  primarily  at  their  boundaries,  where
earthquakes,  volcanoes,  and  mountains  are  concentrated.  We  have
such  boundaries  in  California  and  Oregon  and  Washington  and
Alaska.

NASA’s critical contribution to plate tectonics was to provide the
first  direct  measurements  of  the  motions  of  the  plates  through
space  geodata  techniques.  Research  frontiers  now  are  focused  on
exactly  what  is  happening  at  the  plate  boundaries,  what  are  the
governing  processes,  and  how  does  the  solid  Earth  interact  with
the rest of the Earth system.

Our working group developed four criteria to select among future
programs.  A  question  to  be  addressed  by  NASA’s  programs  should
be  of  fundamental  scientific  importance,  criteria  number  one.  It
should have a strong implication for society, number two. It should
be  amenable  to  substantial  progress  through  new  observations,
number  three.  And  there  should  be  unique  contributions  that
NASA could provide.

With  these  criteria,  the  working  group  identified  six  grand  chal-
lenges,  questions  of  highest  priority,  in  the  area  of  fault  zones,
landform  change,  sea  level  change,  volcanic  activity,  internal  dy-
namics, and the Earth’s dynamic magnetic field.

Next slide, please.
In  the  near-term,  the  highest  priority  new  mission  that  our
group  recommended  for  solid  Earth  science  is  a  satellite  dedicated
to Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, also known as InSAR.
Such  a  mission,  depicted  in  this  animation  flying  over  southern
California,  is  technically  feasible  and  addresses  five  of  the  six
grand challenges for the solid Earth, and it is a critical element of

46

the  EarthScope  project  in  partnership  with  the  National  Science
Foundation  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  The  mission  will  open
the  globe  to  new  measurements  of  surface  movements  in  earth-
quake zones, such as depicted here.

And on the next slide.
It would provide critical observations as well as other areas, such
as  active  volcanic  centers.  What  you  see  are  four  volcanic  areas  in
South  America  thought  to  be  inactive  until  InSAR  observations
showed  that  they  were,  in  fact,  inflating,  as  you  see  here  in  these
Interferograms.  But  these  volcanoes  could  have  been  in  Oregon  or
Washington or Alaska, for that matter. InSAR, as well, can address
that  movements  of  the  Earth’s  major  ice  sheets,  coastal  zones,
areas  susceptible  to  flood  or  landslides,  and  can  reveal  the  under-
lying processes as well as provide a basis for hazard mitigation and
response.

Of course, the recommendations of our working group are for the
solid  Earth  component  of  the  Earth  system,  and  those  must  be  in-
tegrated  into  the  broader  spectrum  of  NASA  programs  for  all  of
Earth sciences.

But  it  is  important,  as  I  think  this  committee  recognizes  on  the
basis  of  the  opening  remarks,  that  our  nation’s  space  agency,  as  it
carries  out  its  many  missions  of  exploration,  does  not  lose  sight  of
the special role that it can play in unraveling the mysteries of our
own planet.

For  the  foreseeable  future,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  Earth  is
our only home. We owe it to our children and theirs to understand
how to live here to the betterment of all.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Solomon follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF SEAN C. SOLOMON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and Members of the House
Science Committee. I am pleased to join you today to comment on NASA’s programs
in Earth science.

By  way  of  introduction,  I  am  both  an  Earth  scientist  and  a  planetary  scientist.
I am the Director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Insti-
tution of Washington, a former President of the American Geophysical Union—with
more  than  40,000  members  the  world’s  largest  professional  society  in  the  Earth
sciences,  and  the  Principal  Investigator  for  one  of  NASA’s  missions  in  solar  system
exploration.

First, let me begin by affirming my conviction that NASA has a continuing, strong
role to play in the study of our planet. As the lead federal agency for technical inno-
vation in space, with a clear charter for advancing basic knowledge of how this plan-
et operates and for applying that knowledge to address problems of substantial soci-
etal  importance,  NASA  can  contribute  to  an  understanding  of  the  Earth  and  its
workings  in  unique  and  fundamental  ways.  As  this  committee  has  expressed  on
many  occasions,  NASA’s  responsibilities  in  the  Earth  sciences  are  worthy  of  sus-
tained national support.

Second, I applaud the Earth science community for undertaking a decadal survey
of  Earth  science  and  applications  from  space.  This  survey,  co-chaired  by  Dr.  Moore
and operated under the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Research  Council,  is  long  overdue.  Like  the  decadal  surveys  that  the  astronomy
community  has  produced  for  the  last  four  decades  and  the  decadal  survey  that  the
solar  system  exploration  community  published  in  2002,  this  decadal  survey  for
Earth  science  and  applications  from  space  will  provide  a  rationale  for  the  most  im-
portant missions and programs that NASA should undertake in the coming decade,
established  on  the  basis  of  sufficient  community  input  and  set  out  with  sufficient
clarity so that the program is seen by all as both achievable in scope and compelling
in vision.

In  2000  NASA’s  Associate  Administrator  for  what  was  then  the  Office  of  Earth
Science  asked  me  to  chair  a  working  group  ‘‘to  guide  the  science  community  in  the
development  of  a  recommended  long-term  vision  and  strategy  from  solid-Earth
science  at  NASA.’’  Over  a  period  of  two  years  that  Solid  Earth  Science  Working
Group  gathered  advice  from  the  community,  and  in  2002  we  published  our  rec-
ommendations  for  a  NASA  program  in  solid-Earth  science  and  applications  for  the
coming  quarter  century.  That  effort  served  as  a  microcosm  for  the  ongoing  Earth
science decadal survey and indeed for the challenge that NASA now faces as it inte-
grates  the  most  important  objectives  across  all  of  its  programs.  Today  I’d  like  to
summarize  the  criteria  that  our  working  group  used  to  prepare  its  strategy,  the
most  important  questions  that  our  group  felt  should  guide  NASA’s  programs,  and
the  most  critical  mission  opportunities  that  our  group  recommended  NASA  should
pursue to address those questions.

The  surface  of  the  Earth  is  where  we  live.  Though  largely  solid,  the  interior  of
the  Earth  is  far  from  static.  The  Earth’s  internal  motions—and  interactions  of  the
solid  Earth  with  the  oceans,  hydrosphere,  and  atmosphere—continually  change  the
surface of our planet. Some of those changes progress at rates that seem nearly im-
perceptible  over  human  lifetimes,  but  others  concentrate  catastrophically  during
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, tsunamis, and other natural dis-
asters.  Space  offers  a  particularly  special  vantage  point  from  which  to  study  these
phenomena,  because  of  the  broad,  synoptic  view  and  the  global  coverage  afforded.
Many  of  the  workings  of  the  solid  Earth  are  linked  by  plate  tectonics—the  theory
that  the  Earth’s  outer  layer  is  divided  into  nearly  rigid  plates  that  are  in  relative
motion  and  interact  primarily  at  their  boundaries.  NASA’s  solid  Earth  program
made a critical contribution to this theory, when space geodetic techniques provided
the first direct measurements of plate motions previously inferred only from the geo-
logical  record.  The  frontier  research  areas  now  are  in  understanding  the  details  of
deformation  and  volcanism  near  plate  boundaries  and  the  interaction  of  the  solid
Earth with the rest of the Earth system.

The  Solid  Earth  Science  Working  Group  utilized  four  criteria  for  selecting  the
most  important  questions  in  solid  Earth  science  that  could  be  addressed  by  NASA.
First, the question should be of fundamental scientific importance. Second, the ques-
tion should have strong implications for society. Third, the question should be ame-
nable  to  substantial  progress  through  new  observations.  And  fourth,  there  should
be unique contributions that NASA can make toward providing answers. These are
quite general criteria that can be applied equally well across other NASA programs.
On  the  basis  of  these  criteria,  the  working  group  identified  six  grand  challenges,
questions  of  the  highest  priority  for  NASA’s  solid  Earth  science  program  over  the
next 25 years:

1. What is the nature of deformation at plate boundaries, and what are the im-

plications for earthquake hazards?

2. How  do  tectonics  and  climate  interact  to  shape  the  Earth’s  surface  and  cre-

ate natural hazards?

3. What are the interactions among ice masses, oceans, and the solid Earth and

their implications for sea-level change?

4. How  do  magmatic  systems  evolve,  and  under  what  conditions  do  volcanoes

erupt?

5. What  are  the  dynamics  of  the  mantle  and  crust,  and  how  does  the  Earth’s

surface respond?

6. What  are  the  dynamics  of  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  and  its  interactions

with the Earth system?

Addressing  these  challenges  involves  leveraging  partnerships  with  other  NASA
programs, with other federal agencies, and with international space agencies. None-
theless,  there  are  specific  technological  capabilities  and  orbital  opportunities  that
only  NASA  can  provide.  The  Solid  Earth  Science  Working  Group  identified  several
observational  strategies—each  combining  spaceborne  and  ground  measurements
with technological advances—where NASA should provide leadership: surface defor-
mation, high-resolution measurements of topography and topographic change, varia-
bility in Earth’s gravity and magnetic fields, imaging spectroscopy of Earth’s chang-
ing  surface,  space  geodetic  networks  and  the  International  Terrestrial  Reference
Frame, and promising new techniques.

In  the  next  several  years,  the  highest-priority  new  mission  for  the  solid  Earth
sciences  is  a  satellite  dedicated  to  Interferometric  Synthetic  Aperture  Radar
(InSAR).  Such  a  mission  is  technically  feasible  today  and  addresses  five  of  the  six
grand  scientific  challenges  for  the  solid  Earth.  Operating  at  a  frequency  that  can
penetrate  vegetative  cover  (L-band)  and  that  has  weekly  access  to  any  land  area,

such an InSAR system could measure surface displacements at the one mm/yr level
over  50  km  horizontal  extents.  InSAR  satellites  flown  by  European  and  Canadian
space  agencies  have  revealed  the  enormous  potential  of  such  a  technology,  but  at
radar frequencies and repeat viewing rates that are not optimum for understanding
solid Earth phenomena. The recommended mission would open the globe to new ob-
servations  of  ongoing  surface  movements  in  major  earthquake  zones,  at  active  vol-
canic centers, on the Earth’s major ice sheets, along coastal zones, and in areas sus-
ceptible  to  floods  and  landslides.  Such  observations  are  likely  to  reveal  diagnostics
of the governing phenomena and can provide a regionally complete basis for disaster
mitigation and response.

A  NASA-led  InSAR  satellite  is  a  critical  element  of  the  multi-agency  EarthScope
project,  whose  other  elements—supported  by  the  National  Science  Foundation—in-
clude  seismometers,  GPS  sensors,  strainmeters  and  a  San  Andreas  Fault  drilling
project  that  together  will  address  the  nature  of  deformation  within  western  North
America  as  well  as  the  structure  and  governing  geological  processes  of  the  North
American  continent.  A  NASA  InSAR  satellite  has  also  been  requested  by  the  U.S.
Geological  Survey  to  assist  that  agency  with  their  ongoing  assessment  of  seismic
hazards and their mitigation within the United States.

The recommendations of the Solid Earth Science Working Group, of course, cover
only  one  component  of  NASA’s  Earth  science  programs.  The  NRC  decadal  survey
and  NASA’s  own  roadmapping  activities,  both  currently  underway,  promise  to  pro-
vide  a  broader  framework  of  recommended  programs  within  which  the  component
addressing the solid Earth and its interactions with the other elements of the Earth
system will hold a natural place.

NASA  is  an  agency  that  is  carrying  out  a  truly  impressive  range  of  human  and
robotic  missions  designed  to  explore  our  space  environment,  our  planetary  neigh-
bors, and the entire cosmos. It is important as NASA carries out its many missions
of exploration that we do not lose sight of the special role that only NASA can play
in  unraveling  the  mysteries  of  our  own  planet.  For  the  foreseeable  future,  Earth  is
our  only  home,  and  we  owe  it  to  our  children  and  theirs  to  understand  how  to  live
here to the betterment of all.

In  my  testimony  today,  I  have  chosen  the  tactic  of  simply  an-

So  let  me  go  immediately  to  the  first  one,  which  is  prioritizing

swering your questions.

future missions.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I might add that that is a novel approach.
Dr.  MCNUTT.  My  own  institution,  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium
Research  Institution,  was  founded  and  privately  funded  by  David
Packard  to  be  a  sort  of  NASA  for  the  oceans,  albeit  on  a  much
smaller  scale.  And  like  NASA,  we  constantly  struggle  at  my  insti-
tution  to  balance  our  various  missions:  exploration,  societally-rel-
evant  research,  technology  development,  and  maintenance  of  time
series.

In  my  written  testimony,  I  have  described  how  we  manage  to
balance  that  diverse  portfolio  and  many  of  the  lessons  we  have
learned along the way in doing so. I regret I don’t have time to tell
you  all  about  that  today.  You  can  read  about  it,  but  frankly,  it  is
not rocket science.

But  let  me  pass  on  just  one  piece  of  advice  from  that  portion  of

my response.

I  have  heard  some  argue  that  NASA  could  prioritize  better  if  it
handed  out  wholesale  areas  of  NASA  research,  such  as  its  Earth
sciences program, to another civilian agency in order to focus its ef-
forts.  Severed  from  the  root  of  the  technology  program  that  feeds
it,  innovation  and  the  program  would  eventually  wither,  and  it
would die.

Okay. Next question.
You  asked  me  to  list  some  of  NASA’s  greatest  achievements  in

the Earth sciences from the past decade.

Certainly one of the most unexpected surprises was the contribu-
tion  of  satellite  altimetry  to  so  many  areas  of  ocean  sciences,  such
as measuring sea level, waves, currents, tides, air moisture, and for
mapping  the  topography  of  the  sea  floor  using  its  gravitational  ef-
fect on the shape of the ocean’s surface.

In  my  first  figure,  I  show  a  dramatic  comparison  of  our  knowl-
edge  of  the  ocean  floor  topography  in  the  South  Pacific  before,  on
top, and after the availability of satellite altimetry data.

I  recall  14  years  ago  serving  as  Chief  Scientist  on  an  oceano-
graphic expedition to the South Pacific. One night, we were steam-
ing full-speed ahead when I called to the bridge from the main lab
to  say  that  based  on  my  processing  of  the  satellite  altimetry  data,
we were headed straight towards a major undersea volcano with a
very  shallow  summit.  The  mate  on  watch  responded  that  nothing
was  marked  on  the  navigational  charts,  but  they  agreed  to  slow
down  anyway.  Less  than  10  minutes  later,  I  heard  a  seaman  yell
out in the moonlight: ‘‘Breakers at 100 yards and closing.’’

Second—next slide.
I will mention a different NASA development, and that is the in-
struments  to  measure  ocean  color  to  monitor  the  concentration  of
microscopic  plants  in  the  upper  ocean.  These  small  plants,  called
phytoplankton, are responsible for producing half of the oxygen we
breathe,  and  they  are  the  fundamental  basis  for  nearly  all  of  the
oceanic  food  chain.  This  is  an  image  of  ocean  color  around  the  is-
land  of  Tasmania,  south  of  Australia,  and  it  was  acquired  by
NASA’s  SeaWiFS  satellite  in  about  one  minute.  It  would  have

taken  10  years  of  nonstop  operations  of  an  oceanographic  ship  to
acquire the same amount of information, and all of the dynamic de-
tails, such as the effect of eddies and currents on the distributions,
would have been smeared out beyond recognition.

These satellite data have shown the changing productivity of the
oceans in response to El Nin˜ o, reduction in polar ice extent, inten-
sity  of  seasonal  upwelling,  and  purposeful  iron  fertilization  of  the
oceans.

Such  monitoring  of  the  biological  changes  in  the  ocean  help  us
to  understand  the  consequences  of  both  natural  and  manmade
changes  to  the  physical  and  chemical  environment  in  which  these
plants survive.

You  also  asked  me  to  list  the  highest  priority  unanswered  ques-

tions in Earth sciences that can be addressed from space.

If I could have the next slide.
Within  the  next  decade,  reconstruction  of  past  climate  records
from  sparse  data  have  demonstrated  that  the  Pacific  Ocean  tem-
perature  and  productivity  of  fisheries  all  change  in  lock  step  to  a
thermal  rhythm  that  waxes  and  wanes  over  decadal  time  periods.
This temperature variation, which is called the Pacific Decadal Os-
cillation,  or  PDO,  involves  temperature  changes  of  one  to  two  de-
grees. That is it. The figure shows that the ‘‘cool’’ phase of the PDO
ruled  the  Pacific  in  the  early  1960s  and  it  corresponded  to  the
crash in the sardine fishery in my own hometown, Monterey, Cali-
fornia.

Landings  of  sardines  fell  from  3.6  million  metric  tons  in  the
1930s  to  less  than  10,000  metric  tons  by  1965.  During  that  same
time,  when  the  sardine  fishery  was  crashing,  the  anchovy  fishery
offshore  Peru  became  the  largest  single-species  fishery  in  the
world.  In  the  mid-1970s,  the  regime  shifted,  and  the  Peruvian  an-
chovy fishery, in turn, crashed.

The  most  recent  regime  shift,  which  coincided  with  the  1997–
1998  El  Nin˜ o,  was  captured  by  a  number  of  satellite  sensors.  Seal
level,  as  measured  by  altimetry,  ocean  temperature,  and  ocean
plant production, as measured by ocean colored, all shifted together
back into the ‘‘cool,’’ or the anchovy-rich phase.

So  what  forces  caused  the  shift?  What  rhythms  govern  the  time
scale?  We  don’t  know.  But  much  is  at  stake.  The  numbers  of
seabirds  in  Hawaii,  Monarch  butterflies  in  Mexico,  and  salmon  in
Oregon all appear to vary at the pace of the PDO.

We  have  only  captured  one  shift  with  high-quality  satellite
records, but the hope is that with patience, we will understand how
the  system  works  and  hopefully  avoid  another  fisheries  crash,  like
the one that devastated Monterey.

In  your  last  question,  you  asked  me  about  the  future  of  NASA’s

contributions to Earth sciences.

Well,  there  are  exciting  couplings  emerging  among  the  physical,
chemical,  and  biological  aspects  of  the  ocean,  that  point  to  a  plan-
etary  metabolism  that  is  best  observed  and  most  efficiently  mon-
itored from space. I have no doubt that upon further investigation,
we  will  find  that  many  changes  in  the  land-based  biosphere  are
also marching in step to that rhythm.

Understanding  exactly  what  will  happen  before  it  happens  is
clearly  a  powerful  position  to  be  in,  because  it  enables  to  take  ac-

tions that benefit from the regime shift as opposed to remaining in
those that suffer from it.

Thank  you  very  much  for  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  on

these critically important issues.

[The prepared statement of Dr. McNutt follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARCIA MCNUTT

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Minority Member, and Members of the Committee:

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  this  morning  on  the  issue  of
NASA’s  past,  present,  and  future  outlook  for  making  contributions  to  the  Nation
and the world in the area of Earth Sciences. My name is Marcia McNutt, and I cur-
rently serve as the President and CEO of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research In-
stitute, better known as MBARI. I am a Past President of the American Geophysical
Union,  the  largest  professional  society  serving  the  geosciences.  It  has  been  more
than a decade since my own research was funded by NASA, and NASA contributes
only  one  percent  of  my  institution’s  annual  operating  budget.  I  mention  these  facts
merely to make the point that I have no financial incentive to provide you with any-
thing other than my best advice.
Prioritizing Missions

First, you ask about prioritizing future missions. My own institution, MBARI, was
founded  and  privately  funded  by  David  Packard  to  be  a  ‘‘NASA  for  the  oceans,’’  al-
beit on a much smaller scale. Like NASA, we constantly struggle at MBARI to bal-
ance  our  various  missions.  We  must  continue  to  explore  the  ocean  in  new  dimen-
sions  while  still  conducting  societally-relevant  ocean  research.  We  must  apply
emerging technologies to next-generation ocean systems without abandoning critical
long-term time series.

There  is  no  magic  formula  for  making  these  hard  choices.  Tackling  societally-rel-
evant  problems  with  near-term  payback  justifies  the  investment  to  today’s  tax-
payers,  while  exploration  lays  the  foundation  for  the  societally-relevant  research  of
the  future  and  entrains  the  next  generation.  NASA  is  the  only  civilian  agency  that
has the required capacity, tradition, and track record to vigorously pursue the tech-
nology  development  that  will  fuel  tomorrow’s  discoveries.  But  at  the  same  time,
NASA has an obligation to maintain certain critical time series as long as the soci-
etal  relevance  is  high,  the  rate  of  discoveries  continues  unabated,  and  the  incre-
mental  cost  is  low  as  compared  with  the  cumulative  prior  investment.  Unlike  most
S&T  products,  the  value  of  time  series  only  increases  with  age  since  inception.  I
have  heard  some  argue  that  NASA  could  hand  off  wholesale  areas  of  NASA  re-
search,  such  as  the  Earth  sciences  program,  to  another  civilian  agency  in  order  to
focus its efforts. Severed from the root of the technology program that feeds it, inno-
vation in the program would eventually wither and die.

So  how  do  we  at  MBARI  maintain  a  balanced  portfolio  given  these  different,  but
essential  missions?  First,  we  determine  what  rough  percentage  of  resources  should
be reserved for each mission area, and enforce the quota vigorously. The quotas are
set so as to maintain critical mass and set a reasonable level of expectation in each
program area such that the associated researchers can make long-term plans. If our
overall budget grows, everything grows proportionally. If the overall budget shrinks,
everything  shrinks  proportionally.  Within  those  mission  areas,  projects  compete
with  other  like  projects,  but  it  would  be  unfair  to  pit  exploration,  for  example,
versus  societally-relevant  research  because  different  criteria  need  to  be  used  to
measure their respective values.

Like  NASA,  my  MBARI  also  undertakes  high  risk,  long-lead  time  projects.

Through experience, we have learned a few important lessons:

1. Protect  the  rest  of  the  research  portfolio  from  being  consumed  by
the  large,  long-term  project  by  respecting  the  percentage  quotas.  It
is the rest of the research portfolio that helps to manage risk, retain balance,
and nurture the seeds of the next big project.

2. Structure  the  big  project  so  that  it  provides  science  return  at  many
incremental steps along the way. We didn’t have to discover this for our-
selves at MBARI, because the Earth sciences community had already learned
this lesson the hard way through the Mohole Project in the 1960s. The initial
objective  was  to  drill  through  the  ocean  crust  into  the  underlying  mantle
rocks.  The  project  proved  to  be  so  technically  challenging  and  so  mired  in
management  missteps  that  after  many  years  and  many  wasted  millions  of

dollars  it  took  an  act  of  Congress  to  kill  it.  Out  of  the  ashes  of  the  Mohole
Project  arose  the  Deep  Sea  Drilling  Project,  now  known  as  the  Integrated
Ocean  Drilling  Program.  The  Mohole’s  successor  program  had  much  more
modest  and  achievable  goals  that  kept  the  scientific  community  excited  and
engaged  as  remarkable  discoveries  were  made  in  every  ocean  basin.  The
seafloor spreading hypothesis was confirmed. Climate records extending back
more than 100 million years were recovered. And now, nearly 50 years after
the Mohole Project was first conceived, we are finally on the brink of drilling
into the oceanic upper mantle!

3. If the project is really big, get lots of help. We get help from institutions
like  Woods  Hole  and  JPL  for  our  biggest  projects.  The  drilling  program  dis-
cussed above involved 23 different nations and is, in fact, held up as a model
for international scientific cooperation.

4. Get  realistic  cost  and  schedule  estimates  for  the  big  project  before
undertaking  it,  including  an  assessment  of  the  value  of  what  will
need  to  fall  off  your  agenda  if  you  pursue  it.  And  then  make  sure  you
can  afford  it.  If  you  have  structured  the  big  project  for  incremental  science
return  (see  #2  above),  then  it  won’t  matter  if  you  don’t  achieve  your  goal
right away because the discoveries along the way will maintain the project’s
momentum,  keep  the  research  community  engaged,  and  justify  the  invest-
ment.

NASA’s Greatest Achievements in the Earth Sciences

You  also  asked  me  to  list  some  of  NASA’s  greatest  achievements  in  the  Earth
Sciences from the past few decades. There are so many—the discovery of the ozone
hole, the direct measurement of plate tectonic drift from space, the detection of post-
seismic crustal deformation that influences the pattern of future earthquakes using
Synthetic Aperture Radar, . . .. The list goes on. Knowing that you will be hearing
from  Drs.  Solomon  and  Killeen  on  the  accomplishments  in  the  area  of  solid  Earth
and atmosphere, respectively, I’ll concentrate on the oceans.

Certainly  one  of  the  most  unexpected  surprises  was  the  contribution  of  satellite
altimetry  to  so  many  areas  of  ocean  sciences.  NASA  pioneered  the  technology  for
measuring  sea  surface  height  from  800  km  altitude  in  space  to  10  centimeter  accu-
racy  nearly  30  years  ago.  The  technique  was  so  successful  for  measuring  sea  level,
waves, currents, tides, and air moisture, and for mapping the topography of seafloor
using  its  gravitational  effect  on  the  shape  of  the  ocean  surface,  that  a  number  of
other  agencies  both  foreign  and  domestic  launched  follow-on  altimeter  missions.
NASA  continues  to  operate  altimeters  from  space  today,  and  each  generation  im-
proves in its accuracy and scientific return.

Figure  1  shows  one  dramatic  comparison  of  our  knowledge  of  the  ocean  floor  to-
pography  before  and  after  the  availability  of  satellite  altimetry  data.  I  recall  14
years ago serving as chief scientist on an oceanographic expedition to the South Pa-
cific. One night we were steaming full speed ahead, when I called to the bridge from
the  main  lab  to  say  that  based  on  my  processing  of  the  satellite  altimetry  data,  we
were  headed  straight  towards  a  major  undersea  volcano  that  might  have  a  very
shallow  summit.  The  mate  on  watch  responded  that  nothing  was  marked  on  the
navigational  charts  in  the  vicinity,  but  he  agreed  to  slow  down  anyway.  Less  than
10 minutes later I heard a seaman yell out in the moonlight: ‘‘Breakers at 100 yards
and  closing!’’  Because  the  mate  had  already  backed  down  on  the  engines,  the  ship
was able to turn before crashing into the reef.

53

As  a  second,  very  different  example,  I  will  briefly  mention  NASA’s  development
of  instruments  to  measure  ocean  color  to  monitor  the  concentration  of  microscopic
plants in the upper ocean. These small plants, called phytoplankton, are responsible
for  producing  about  half  of  the  oxygen  that  we  breathe  and  are  the  fundamental
basis for nearly all of the oceanic food chain. One teaspoon of seawater can contain
as  many  as  a  million  of  these  fast-growing  plants.  NASA  satellites  have  monitored
the  temporal  changes  in  the  concentrations  of  these  minute  plants  from  700  km  in
space for a little more than two decades. This image of ocean color around Tasmania
south of Australia was acquired by the SeaWIFS satellite in just about one minute.

It would have taken 10 years of non-stop operations of an oceanographic ship to ac-
quire  the  same  amount  of  information,  and  all  of  the  dynamic  details,  such  as  the
effect of eddies and currents on the distributions, would have been smeared out be-
yond  recognition.  These  satellite  data  have  shown  the  changing  productivity  of  the
oceans  in  response  to  El  Nin˜ os,  reduction  in  polar  ice  extent,  intensity  of  seasonal
upwelling, and purposeful iron fertilization of the oceans. Such monitoring of the bi-
ological  changes  in  the  ocean  help  us  to  understand  the  consequences  of  both  nat-
ural  and  man-made  changes  to  the  physical  and  chemical  environment  in  which
these plants survive.

Highest Priority Unanswered Questions

In  your  second  question,  you  asked  me  to  list  the  highest  priority  unanswered
questions  in  Earth  Sciences  that  can  be  addressed  from  space.  Again,  I  will  choose
an  ocean  example.  Within  the  last  decade,  reconstruction  of  past  climate  records
from sparse data have demonstrated that the Pacific ocean temperature and produc-
tivity of fisheries all change in lock step to a climate rhythm that waxes and wanes
over  decadal  time  scales  Figure  3).  This  temperature  variation,  called  the  Pacific
Decadal Oscillation or PDO, involves temperature changes of just one to two degrees
and has also been well correlated with changes in sea level recorded by satellite al-
timeters.  The  Figure  below  shows  that  the  ‘‘cool’’  phase  of  the  PDO  that  ruled  the
Pacific  in  the  early  1960’s  corresponded  to  the  crash  in  the  sardine  fishery  in  my
own hometown, Monterey, CA. Landings of sardines fell from 3.6 million metric tons
in  the  1930’s  to  less  than  10,000  metric  tons  by  1965.  During  that  same  time,  the
anchovy fishery offshore Peru became the biggest single-species fishery in the world.
In  the  mid-1970’s,  the  regime  shifted,  and  the  Peruvian  anchovy  fishery  crashed.
The  most  recent  regime  shift  which  coincided  with  the  1997–98  El  Nin˜ o  was  cap-
tured  by  a  number  of  satellite  sensors:  sea  level  (as  measured  by  altimetry),  ocean
temperature,  and  ocean  plant  production  (as  measured  by  ocean  color)  all  shifted
together  back  into  the  cool  (anchovy  dominated)  phase.  So  what  forces  cause  the
shift?  What  rhythms  govern  the  time  scale?  We  don’t  know,  and  its  long  life  span

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

(20–30  years  between  regime  shifts)  means  that  we  must  be  patient.  But  much  is
at  stake.  The  numbers  of  seabirds  in  Hawaii,  monarch  butterflies  in  Mexico,  and
salmon  in  Oregon  all  appear  to  vary  at  the  pace  of  the  PDO—despite  the  fact  that
the temperature variations are one to two degrees! We have only captured one shift
with  high-quality  records,  but  the  hope  is  that  with  patience  we  will  understand
how the system works, and hopefully avoid another fisheries crash like the one that
devastated Monterey.

Future Prospects

In  your  fourth  question,  you  asked  me  about  the  future  of  NASA’s  contributions
to Earth Sciences. I hope that I have already made the point that there are exciting
couplings  emerging  among  the  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  aspects  of  the
ocean  that  point  to  a  planetary  metabolism  that  is  best  observed  and  most  effi-
ciently  monitored  from  space.  I  have  no  doubt  that  upon  further  investigation,  we
will find that many changes in the land-based biosphere are also controlled by simi-
lar  rhythms,  just  as  scientists  have  been  able  to  demonstrate  the  connection  be-
tween  the  El  Nin˜ o  event  in  the  eastern  tropical  Pacific  and,  for  example,  drought
in South Africa. Understanding exactly what will happen before it happens is clear-
ly  a  powerful  position  to  be  in,  because  it  enables  us  to  take  actions  that  benefit
from  the  regime  shift,  as  opposed  to  those  that  suffer  from  it.  I  am  personally  very
excited  about  the  prospects  of  monitoring  salinity  directly  from  space,  in  order  to
get the second necessary component for understanding the thermo-haline circulation
that  transports  so  much  of  the  planets’  mass  and  energy.  I  see  the  potential  for
monitoring  the  planet’s  carbon  cycle  from  space  through  both  direct  measurements
and better modeling of the thermohaline circulation. For example, we estimate that
the oceans take up a net 2,000 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmos-
phere  annually,  but  that  number  is  the  small  difference  between  two  very  large
numbers:  90,000  million  tons  of  CO2 taken  up  by  ocean  plants  and  other  processes

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

versus  88,000  million  tons  of  CO2 returned  to  the  atmosphere  from  the  ocean
through  the  upwelling  of  deep  ocean  waters.  Clearly  our  ‘‘balance  of  payments’’  (so
to  speak)  in  terms  of  the  carbon  budget  is  very  sensitive  to  both  the  physical  and
biological  states  of  the  ocean,  which  in  turn  vary  with  both  the  El  Nin˜ o  and  the
PDO oscillations. There is so much to learn, and only when we have a better under-
standing  of  all  of  these  cycles  and  where  we  are  within  them  will  we  be  able  to
make wise policies to protect and sustain our Earth environment.

Thank  you  very  much  for  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  on  these  critically  im-

portant issues.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MARCIA MCNUTT

Marcia  McNutt  is  the  President  and  CEO  of  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium  Re-
search  Institute  (MBARI)  in  Moss  Landing,  California.  MBARI  is  a  nonprofit  re-
search  laboratory  funded  by  the  David  and  Lucile  Packard  Foundation  to  develop
and apply new technology for the exploration of the oceans.

McNutt is a native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, where she graduated class valedic-
torian  from  Northrop  Collegiate  School  in  1970.  In  1973,  she  received  a  BA  degree
in  Physics,  summa  cum  laude,  Phi  Beta  Kappa,  from  Colorado  College  in  Colorado
Springs. As a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow, she studied geophysics
at  Scripps  Institution  of  Oceanography  in  La  Jolla,  California,  where  she  earned  a
Ph.D. in Earth Sciences in 1978.

After a brief appointment at the University of Minnesota, she spent the next three
years at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, working on the prob-
lem of earthquake prediction. In 1982, she joined the faculty at MIT in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.  At  MIT,  she  was  appointed  the  Griswold  Professor  of  Geophysics
and  served  as  Director  of  the  Joint  Program  in  Oceanography  and  Applied  Ocean
Science and Engineering, a cooperative graduate educational program between MIT
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

McNutt’s  research  ranges  from  studies  of  ocean  island  volcanism  in  French  Poly-
nesia to continental break-up in the Western U.S. to uplift of the Tibet Plateau. She
has participated in 15 major oceanographic expeditions, and served as chief scientist
on  more  than  half  of  those  voyages.  She  has  published  90  peer-reviewed  scientific
articles.

In 1997, McNutt took over the leadership at MBARI. McNutt has encouraged the
institution  to  tackle  the  sort  of  research  problems  that  traditionally  have  been  dif-
ficult to support under federal grants and contracts, such as high-risk ventures, de-
velopment efforts with long lead times between conception and scientific return, and
interdisciplinary  research.  She  has  also  encouraged  her  researchers  to  develop  af-
fordable  technology  for  ocean  exploration  and  observation  that  can  be  passed  on  to
the larger oceanographic community.

McNutt’s  honors  and  awards  include  membership  in  the  American  Philosophical
Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1985, she was awarded
a  Mary  Ingraham  Bunting  Fellowship  from  Radcliffe  College.  She  also  holds  hon-
orary doctoral degrees from the University of Minnesota and from Colorado College.
In 1988, McNutt won the Macelwane Award from the American Geophysical Union,
presented  for  outstanding  research  by  a  young  scientist.  In  2003  she  was  honored
as  the  Scientist  of  the  Year  from  the  ARCS  Foundation.  In  2004,  she  received  the
Outstanding  Alumni  Award  from  the  University  of  California  at  San  Diego.  She  is
a  fellow  of  the  American  Geophysical  Union,  the  Geological  Society  of  America,  the
American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science,  and  the  International  Asso-
ciation of Geodesy.

McNutt served as President of the American Geophysical Union from 2000–2002.
She also chaired the President’s Panel on Ocean Exploration, convened by President
Clinton  to  examine  the  possibility  of  initiating  a  major  U.S.  program  in  exploring
the  oceans.  She  currently  serves  on  numerous  evaluation  and  advisory  boards  for
institutions  such  as  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium,  Stanford  University,  Harvard
University, Science Magazine, and Schlumberger.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  thank  you  for  your  direct  response  to
our  questions,  but  you  left  us  with  a  bigger  questions  with  your,
‘‘Breakers  at  100  yards  and  closing,’’  and  then  you  went  off  in  a
new direction. I assume the ship did, too.

Dr. MCNUTT. The ship, because it had slowed down, was able to

turn in time, and we missed the reef.

STATEMENT  OF  AND  DR.  RAY  A.  WILLIAMSON,  RESEARCH
PROFESSOR, SPACE POLICY INSTITUTE, THE GEORGE WASH-
INGTON UNIVERSITY
Dr.  WILLIAMSON.  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Minority  Member
Gordon,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  a  pleasure  to  be  here
today  to  testify  on  NASA’s  Earth  science  efforts  and  their  impact
on U.S. citizens.

For  nearly  25  years,  I  have  followed  and  analyzed  the  develop-
ment  of  U.S.  Earth  science  and  applications  capabilities.  During
that  period,  federal  investments  in  Earth  science  research  and
technology  have  led  to  powerful  methods  for  improving  weather
and  climate  forecasts,  including  advanced  warnings  of  changing
weather,  damaging  weather,  transportation  planning  and  moni-
toring,  agricultural  planning,  energy  efficiency,  and  other
geographically- and environmentally-influenced activities.

Yet  despite  the  substantial  progress  over  the  years,  a  lot  more
can  and  should  be  done.  And  it  should  be  done  to  assure  that  the
benefits  of  future  Earth  science  research  actually  reach  the  Amer-
ican  public.  NASA’s  Earth  science  research  is  critical  to  that  goal.
It is a major national asset.

In recent research co-funded by NASA and NOAA, my colleagues
and I have explored the scope and scale of social and economic ben-
efits  provided  by  NASA’s  Earth  science  research  and  by  NOAA’s
applications of some of that research. We determined that realized
benefits  were  quite  substantial,  but  not  well  quantified.  Neverthe-
less, all available studies indicate, with little doubt, that improved
weather  and  climate  forecasts  have  saved  millions  of  dollars  in
property damage, prevented the loss of life from severe storms, and
contributed  millions  or  even  billions  of  dollars  to  industrial  effi-
ciency.

Now other members of this panel have sited other examples of—
many  examples  of  Earth  science  research.  I  want  to  add  one  that
is  also—is  on  my  list  but  hasn’t  been  mentioned,  and  that  is  the
significant  science  and  technical  support  in  the  development  of  a
$3.5 billion, that is yearly, satellite and aerial remote-sensing data
and applications industry, which is now growing at a rate between
nine and 14 percent per annum.

At  present,  as  I  have  mentioned,  we  cannot  draw  quantitative
conclusions  about  the  total  social  and  economic  benefits  of  NASA’s
Earth  science  information.  This  means  that  benefit  studies  cannot
yet  be  used  with  confidence  to  guide  future  investments  in  space
systems.  Since  NASA  is  at  the  cutting  edge  of  Earth  science  re-
search  in  this  country,  it  should  focus  more  attention  on  this  im-
portant subject in order to guide its future research.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  see  four  major  issues  related  to  NASA’s  ability

to support the country in Earth science research.

First,  as  has  been  mentioned,  declining  Earth  science  budgets

and delayed or canceled Earth science missions.

Second, U.S. leadership in the international Global Earth Obser-
vation System of Systems. We initiated that effort nearly two years
ago, and it stands to bring greater benefits than ever to the United
States  and  to  the  world.  Congress  should  support  that  leadership.
Three,  the  general  lack  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  on
the benefits of Earth science research. In other words, what are we
buying with our dollars, and how much has it gotten us.

Four, insufficient attention to developing the methods and paths
to NASA’s—take NASA’s research efforts into operations and to ap-
plications for end-users, in other words, the American public.

In  summary,  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  has  provided  sub-
stantial  benefits  to  the  United  States.  I  see  several  ways  in  which
this committee could be especially helpful in assuring that the pub-
lic actually reaps the benefits of this research.

One,  eliminate  the  steady  decline  in  the  proportion  of  NASA’s
budget  devoted  to  Earth  science.  NASA’s  Earth  science  program
produces real benefits to the American public and should be main-
tained  at  a  level  that  maintains  strong  U.S.  leadership  in  Earth
science research.

Two,  provide  additional  resources  to  support  U.S.  leadership  in

the Global Earth Observation System of Systems.

Three, authorize NASA to direct a greater attention to the quan-
tification  of  the  benefits  of  Earth  science  research  applications  to
America’s  industry  and  the  public  sector  and  the  policy  implica-
tions of those benefits.

Four, include an exploration of the issue of transition from Earth
science  research  to  useful  applications  in  the  Committee’s  next
hearing related to Earth science and applications.

In the eyes of many, Earth science research is not nearly as sexy
or as cutting-edge as exploration beyond Earth orbit. It doesn’t get
the headlines. It certainly doesn’t command the same sort of public
attention  as  the  astounding  results  from  the  Hubble  Telescope  or
the  Cassini  Mission  to  Saturn.  Nevertheless,  Earth  science  re-
search  truly  does  involve  exciting  new  technological  developments
and  may  be,  in  the  long  run,  vastly  more  important  in  direct  im-
pacts to the economy and the public welfare than these other exam-
ples.

Just  imagine  what  our  lives  would  be  like  if  our  Earth  science
and meteorological satellites all suddenly failed. It is hard to imag-
ine. Tomorrow’s weather would again become guesswork, and elec-
tricity  would  start  to  cost  us  more.  Local  and  regional  environ-
mental  trends  would  be  next  to  impossible  to  determine  and  mon-
itor,  as  we  have  heard.  Ships  in  the  North  and  South  Atlantic
would  be  vastly  more  susceptible  to  iceberg  collisions,  and  other
hazards,  such  as  underground  volcanoes.  Even  the  security  of  our
homeland would be lessened and our defense efforts hindered. It is
not  well  understood,  I  think,  how  much  of  NASA’s  Earth  science
efforts  have  drifted  in  and  supported  our  homeland  security—or
could  support  our  homeland  security  and  our  defense  applications.
In short, we would stand to lose the substantial benefits that we
have already gained from Earth science research applications. Con-
tinued  aggressive  support  of  these  R&D  and  operational  efforts  is
an  essential  component  of  the  future  of  the  economy  and  security
of our nation.

And  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  this  opportunity  to  present

my views on these issues.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Williamson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RAY A. WILLIAMSON

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  a  pleasure  to  be  here  today  to
testify  on  NASA’s  Earth  science  efforts  and  their  impact  on  U.S.  citizens.  This  is
an important and crucial subject in these days of increasingly tight federal budgets
for science and the development of useful applications of science results. For nearly
25  years  I  have  followed  and  analyzed  the  development  of  U.S.  Earth  science  and
applications capabilities, first for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment
and  since  1995,  as  a  Research  Professor  in  the  Space  Policy  Institute  within  The
George Washington University.

During  those  two  and  a  half  decades,  the  United  States  has  made  dramatic
progress  in  Earth  science  and  applications.  Investments  in  several  geospatial  tech-
nologies  have  contributed  to  the  development  of  powerful  methods  for  improving
weather  and  climate  forecasts  (including  advance  warnings  of  severe  weather),
transportation  planning  and  monitoring,  agricultural  planning,  energy  efficiency,
and other geographically—and environmentally—influenced activities.

Whether through NASA, NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey, or though university
research  funded  by  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  federal  investment  has
been  key  to  bringing  the  science  and  the  resulting  methods  and  technologies  to  a
status that they can truly benefit not only the Federal Government including impor-
tant  defense  and  homeland  security  programs  but  also  State  and  local  authorities,
the  private  sector,  and  especially  the  average  citizen.  Yet,  despite  the  substantial
progress  over  the  years,  a  lot  more  can  and  should  be  done  to  make  sure  that  the
benefits of science research actually reach the American public.
Benefits of Earth Science Research

Mr. Chairman, among other things, your letter of invitation to testify in this hear-
ing  asked  about  past  accomplishments  from  the  NASA  Earth  science  program  and
what  future  benefits  can  be  expected.  In  a  recent  research  project  co-funded  by
NASA  and  NOAA,  my  colleagues  at  the  Space  Policy  Institute  and  I  explored  the
scope  of  social  and  economic  benefits  provided  by  NASA’s  current  Earth  science  re-
search  and  NOAA’s  applications  of  science  results  to  weather  and  climate,  and  de-
termined  that  in  sum  they  were  quite  substantial.  However,  reliable  estimates  of
the total of such benefits do not exist and the available socioeconomic studies focus
on  specific  examples  of  benefits  to  particular  industries,  geographical  areas,  and
types of storms or damage. All of the available studies indicate with little doubt that
improved  weather  and  climate  forecasts  have  saved  many  millions  of  dollars  in
property damage, prevented the loss of life from severe storms, and contributed fur-
ther millions of dollars to industrial efficiency.

Both  NASA  and  NOAA  have  made  substantial  contributions  to  the  development
of  more  accurate,  longer-term  weather  and  climate  forecasts.  NASA  has  provided
the lead in new instrumentation, new understanding of the basic chemistry, physics,
and biology of Earth systems, and advances in modeling and data assimilation tech-
niques.  NOAA  has  provided  long-term,  routine  observations  focused  on  improving
forecast  models  and  other  decision  support  tools  directly  benefiting  the  end  user  of
weather  and  climate  information.  More  specifically,  benefits  of  NASA’s  Earth
science research include, but are certainly not limited to:

1. A  much  deeper  and  broader  scientific  understanding  of  Earth  systems  and
how  they  function,  which  in  addition  to  contributing  to  general  scientific
knowledge,  also  provide  the  basis  for  applied  use  of  this  important  knowl-
edge;

2. Development  of  sophisticated  satellite  sensors  capable  of  monitoring  Earth

systems for the benefit of U.S. citizens;

3. Significant  scientific  and  technical  support  in  the  development  of  a  $3.5  bil-
lion dollar satellite and aerial remote sensing data and applications industry
that  is  now  growing  at  a  rate  between  nine  and  14  percent  per  annum  [1];
4. Data, models, and other decision support tools for weather and climate fore-
casts,  including  forecasts  of  damaging  storms.  Data  from  the  TRMM  sat-
ellite,  for  example,  enable  forecasts  to  predict  hurricane  paths  and  rainfall
amounts much more accurately [2].

When  we  examined  the  economics  and  related  benefits  literature  related  to
NASA’s  Earth  science  research  for  quantitative  economic  studies  or  value  analysis,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

we  found  relatively  few  in-depth  studies.  Further,  although  most  studies  cited  siz-
able  benefits,  each  study  was  carried  out  using  a  different  valuation  methodology,
or  was  focused  on  a  narrow  element  of  the  industry  under  study.  Taken  together,
these  two  factors  mean  that  few  quantitative  conclusions  can  be  drawn  about  the
total  social  and  economic  benefits  of  NASA’s  Earth  science  information  to  U.S.  in-
dustry  and  to  Federal,  State,  and  local  government  applications.  This  means  that
benefits  studies  cannot  yet  be  used  with  confidence  to  guide  future  investments  in
space systems.

Yet  our  studies  show  that  the  supportable,  qualitative  benefits  of  Earth  science
research  are  quite  high  to  nearly  all  sectors  of  industry  and  to  the  public  sector.
Since  NASA  is  at  the  cutting  edge  of  Earth  science  research  in  this  country,  it
should  focus  more  attention  on  this  important  subject  in  order  to  assist  in  guiding
its  future  research  agenda.  This  is  not  to  say  that  expected  practical  benefits  alone
should determine NASA’s future research agenda, since such an approach might sti-
fle  creative,  breakthrough  research  efforts,  but  such  benefits  should  play  a  role  in
the decision process when difficult decisions are being made among projects.
The Electric Energy Industry

In  order  to  understand  the  range  of  issues  surrounding  the  development  of  bene-
fits  estimates,  we  focused  on  the  potential  social  and  economic  benefits  to  the  elec-
tric  energy  industry  of  improved  weather  and  climate  forecasts  and  other  informa-
tion  derived  from  a  combination  of  satellite  data  and  other  weather  information.
This  industry,  on  which  the  United  States  depends  as  a  critical  part  of  the  infra-
structure of economic growth and well being, relies deeply on accurate weather and
climate  forecasts  to  estimate  its  customers’  future  demand  for  electricity  and  the
company’s  needed  future  fuel  supplies.  Because  satellites  operate  either  globally  or
over  very  large  regions,  they  provide  synoptic  views  of  meteorological  conditions
over substantial portions of the globe that cannot be monitored cost-effectively from
aircraft or ground stations. In fact, some 90 percent of the data now used in weather
forecasts derive from satellite measurements.

Our  study  shows  that  electric  utilities  derive  the  greatest  economic  benefit  from
weather forecasts that are accurate over 2–4 days. Improved 7–10 day weather fore-
casts  would  also  provide  additional  economic  benefit  for  utilities.[3]  The  companies
use  monthly  and  seasonal  weather  forecasts  for  scheduling  maintenance  and  for
meeting  EPA-set  yearly  emission  allotments.  Longer-term  forecasts  assist  in  plan-
ning for new power generation facilities.

The  industry  also  depends  on  such  forecasts  for  severe  weather  warnings.  As
noted  above,  most  of  the  data  inputs  for  these  forecasts  derive  from  satellites.  The
latter data are especially important in geographic areas at risk from severe storms.
Our  study  also  shows  that  the  industry  has  need  of  other  types  of  satellite  data.
For example, some companies use NASA’s MODIS data to estimate snow cover and
Landsat  data  to  assist  in  meeting  environmental  regulations  on  transmission  line
rights  of  way.  All  of  these  data  contribute  an  economic  benefit  to  the  industry,
which, in a competitive environment, will generally result in greater efficiencies and
in lower electricity prices to customers.

Satellite  information  can  also  provide  significant  benefits  in  planning  and  oper-
ating  electric  production  dependent  on  renewable  sources  of  energy  such  as  wind,
sunlight,  and  water.  At  least  seventeen  (17)  states  have  now  mandated  the  use  of
renewable  energy  sources  in  generating  electrical  power;  in  the  future,  other  states
are  likely  to  add  similar  regulatory  requirements.  Satellite-based  remote  sensing
can  aid  in  realizing  the  potential  of  exploiting  renewable  energy  resources  by  help-
ing in the optimal location of generating facilities as well as in the operational deci-
sions of generating facilities and electric power grid management. The future growth
and  development  of  this  increasingly  important  sector  of  energy  generation  would
be significantly assisted by NASA satellite data which can provide a principal ingre-
dient  for  this  effort  to  assist  in  the  siting  and  operations  of  these  energy  sources.
More  accurately  measuring  the  economic  value  of  the  contribution  of  satellites
would  help  in  guiding  federal  policy  toward  the  electric  utility  industry.  However,
the  use  of  weather  and  climate  forecasts  and  other  satellite  data  in  this  industry
represents  only  part  of  the  total  benefit  inherent  in  the  environmental  information
gathered  by  spacecraft.  Many  other  weather-dependent  economic  sectors,  including
water  resources,  agriculture,  construction,  recreation,  and  the  general  public  would
also  profit  from  a  better  understanding  of  the  benefits  and  mechanisms  of  both
weather forecasting and the use of those forecasts. These economic benefits are most
evident in the ability of better weather forecasts to reduce the risks and uncertainty
in planning and performing a wide variety of economic and social functions.

Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOS)

61

In  July  2003,  the  United  States  invited  other  countries  to  enter  into  discussions
regarding  the  establishment  of  an  Integrated  Global  Earth  Observation  System
(IEOS)  that  would  gather  as  much  information  as  possible  from  current  Earth  ob-
servation  systems  operating  in  space,  the  atmosphere,  and  on  Earth,  with  the  goal
of  establishing  comprehensive  data  and  information  systems  to  guide  our  manage-
ment of planet Earth. That initial meeting was a resounding success and led to the
current  10-year  Implementation  Plan  agreed  to  by  more  than  30  countries  in  July
of 2004.

The  Implementation  Plan,  which  consumed  considerable  effort  in  all  countries
party  to  the  agreement,  is  only  the  beginning  of  many  years  of  additional  effort  to
bring the plan to fruition. NASA plays a very important role in this effort, supplying
new,  more  useful  satellite  data  sets  and  assisting  with  development  of  models  and
other tools to make the data sets truly useful.

This international system can provide significant additional benefits to the United
States,  as  well  as  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  in  many  ways  such  as  reducing  hunger
and  providing  better  warnings  of  impending  natural  disasters.  I  note,  for  example,
that  one  of  the  chief  tasks  of  GEOSS  will  be  to  focus  on  methods  and  means  to  re-
duce  the  impact  to  life  and  property  from  natural  disasters,  such  as  earthquakes
and Tsunamis. Satellite data and methodologies have an important place in this ef-
fort through their ability to gather real-time data on a worldwide basis which is one
very key element of the modeling, forecasting, and warning system.

Having  established  its  leadership  in  GEOSS,  the  United  States  must  now  follow

through on its implementation. This will require sufficient funding for the U.S.

effort,  the  Integrated  Earth  Observation  System  (IEOS)  both  in  continuing
NASA’s Earth science program at a robust level, and in supporting the involvement
of other agencies in the endeavor. As noted in a recent report by the American Me-
teorological Society, ‘‘there will have to be a long-term robust research program de-
signed to add value to the operation of IEOS.’’[4]

Such support should also include research on the expected benefits from such ex-
penditures  and  sustained  efforts  to  include  the  inputs  of  information  users—the
final stakeholders in the IEOS process. After all, there is only so much public money
to  go  around,  especially  in  an  era  of  increasing  budget  deficits,  and  understanding
the  areas  likely  to  return  the  greatest  benefits  will  help  NASA  managers  and  Con-
gress  make  better  funding  decisions  among  the  many  worthy  research  projects  and
proposals.
Bringing Benefits to Users

Despite  the  importance  of  maintaining  a  vigorous  Earth  science  program  at
NASA,  obtaining  more  accurate,  more  detailed  scientific  data  from  satellites  does
not  automatically  lead  to  economic  benefits  to  users  of  the  information.  The  many
and complex steps between the development of forecasts and other decision support
tools  from  satellites  mean  that  expected  benefits  are  not  always  fully  realized  by
the  end  user.  Hence,  considerable  effort  must  be  expended  to  improve  both  the  un-
derstanding  of  all  parties  involved  in  the  process.  This  especially  includes  the  com-
munications  between  the  research  community  and  the  ultimate  users  of  the  infor-
mation.

Second,  the  transfer  of  Earth  observations  information  from  the  producing  agen-
cies of the government to the end users must occur in a timely manner and in easily
used formats. At present this is not always the case. With better appreciation of the
roles and needs of the research, modeling, and end user communities, economic and
social  benefits  of  weather  information  can  improve.  We  need  a  series  of  efforts  to
improve the flow of research results to information end users. I cite as an excellent
example,  H.R.  426,  the  Remote  Sensing  Applications  Act  sponsored  by  Representa-
tive  Mark  Udall,  which  would  institute  a  series  of  competitively  awarded  pilot
projects to encourage public applications of Earth observations data.

Yet,  such  efforts  to  incorporate  beneficial  Earth  science  results  into  the  wider
community will not be enough. In general, NASA and the agencies that use its data
to improve their operations also need to focus on more effective technology transfer,
communication,  and  coordination  among  them.  After  all,  NASA  is  in  the  research
and  development  (R&D)  business,  and  the  user  agencies  as  well  as  the  private  sec-
tor  mold  NASA’s  data  and  other  research  results  to  specific  users  in  the  transition
from  research  to  operations.  It  is  always  easier  and  more  accurate  to  quantify  the
end-use applications than the R&D. Yet, they are so inter-linked in a ‘‘but for’’ chain
of  events  that  benefits  achieved  by  the  end  users  would  not  and  could  not  exist
without  NASA’s  research.  NASA’s  Earth  Science  Applications  Program  is  on  the
right  track  in  centering  its  efforts  on  working  with  the  user  agencies  to  improve

their  processes.  However,  it  will  need  continued  support  and  encouragement  from
Congress and from within NASA itself.
Conclusions

In  summary,  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  has  provided  sustained  benefits  to
the United States. Nevertheless, in order to do more focused, cost-effective planning
for the next steps in Earth science research, the United States needs a comprehen-
sive,  long-term  effort  to  estimate  both  the  measurable  economic  impacts  and  non-
quantifiable social benefits of Earth science research and applications.

I see several ways in which this committee could be especially helpful in assuring

that the public actually reaps the benefits of Earth science research:

1. Eliminate  the  steady  decline  in  the  proportion  of  NASA’s  budget  devoted  to
Earth  science.  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  produces  real  benefits  to  the
American  public  and  should  be  maintained  at  a  level  that  maintains  strong
U.S. leadership in Earth science research.

2. Provide additional resources to support U.S. leadership in GEOSS.
3. Authorize NASA to direct greater attention to the quantification of the bene-
fits  of  Earth  science  research  and  applications  to  America’s  industry  and
public sector, and the policy implications of those benefits.

4. Include an exploration of the issue of ‘‘transition from Earth science research
to  useful  applications’’  in  the  Committee’s  next  hearing  related  to  Earth
science and applications.

In the eyes of many, Earth science research is not nearly as ‘‘sexy’’ or as cutting-
edge as exploration beyond Earth orbit. It certainly doesn’t command the same sort
of  public  attention  as  the  astounding  results  from  the  Hubble  telescope  or  the
Cassini Mission to Saturn. Nevertheless, though it may not be as much in the public
eye,  Earth  science  research  truly  does  involve  exciting  new  technological  develop-
ments  and  may  be  vastly  more  important  in  direct  and  near-term  impacts  to  the
economy  and  the  public  welfare  than  these  other  examples.  Modern  society  has
come  to  depend  on  the  new  knowledge  and  technologies  that  NASA’s  Earth  science
program  provides.  Just  imagine  what  our  lives  would  be  like  if  our  Earth  science
and  meteorological  satellites  all  suddenly  failed.  Tomorrow’s  weather  would  again
become  guesswork  and  electricity  would  start  to  cost  us  more.  Local  and  regional
environmental  trends  would  be  next  to  impossible  to  determine  and  monitor.  Ships
in  the  North  and  South  Atlantic  would  be  vastly  more  susceptible  to  iceberg  colli-
sions  and  other  hazards.  Resource  exploration  and  resource  management  would  be
much more difficult to undertake. Even the security of our homeland would be less-
ened and our defense efforts hindered. Finally, we would be deprived of the benefit
of  seeing  for  ourselves  the  satellite  weather  maps  on  the  evening  news  or  over  the
Internet. In short, we would stand to lose the substantial benefits that we have al-
ready  gained  from  Earth  science  research  and  application  to  the  detriment  of  soci-
ety. Continued aggressive support of these R&D and operational efforts is an essen-
tial component of the future of the economy and security of our nation.

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  for  this  opportunity  to  present  my  views  on  these  im-

portant topics. I welcome questions or comments.

DISCUSSION

THE IMPORTANCE OF EARTH SCIENCE AT NASA

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you, Dr. Williamson, for focusing on
the very real and tangible benefits that the Earth science program
brings to us on the planet Earth.

You know, these aren’t the easiest of times in terms of budgetary
consideration,  and  we  are  not  surprised  when  distinguished  sci-
entists  come  before  us  and  say,  ‘‘At  least  give  us  as  much,  if  not
more.’’  It  is  impossible  to  honor  all  of  those  requests,  but  I  am
somewhat  concerned  that  NASA  is  being  viewed,  by  some,  as  al-
most  a  single-mission  agency,  and  it  is  much  more  than  a  single-
mission  agency.  And  I  am  proud  to  identify  with  the  various  mis-
sions  of  NASA,  including  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration.

But  Mr.  Diaz,  thank  you  very  much  for  your  testimony,  and  I
noted,  with  particular  interest,  the  comment  that  we  are  clearly
emphasizing  a  continuing  commitment  to  Earth  science  and
NASA’s  commitment  to  study  the  Earth  science.  And  you  say  that
is  clearly  reflected  in  our  national  objectives,  maybe  in  the  objec-
tives,  but  not  as  clearly  reflected  in  the  budget  submission.  And  I
see programs being canceled. I see the fate of the GPM mission, the
Global Precipitation Mission, which the Academy says is extremely
important and we should go forward.

And  so,  you  could  have  fooled  me,  I  guess  I  say  in  response  to
your assertion that this is a very high priority. It is important, but
it is not as high a priority as some of us would like.

And I would like to ask the other witnesses across the board: can
you  give  us  a  sort  of  insight  as  to  your  view  of  NASA’s  particular
role in Earth science and why it is so important?

Dr. Moore.
Dr.  MOORE.  I  think  that  you  put  it  perfectly  with  the  word
‘‘science,’’  that  many  of  the  extraordinary  benefits  that  Dr.
Williamson  mentioned,  practical  benefits,  came  from  first  the  re-
search,  scientific  basis.  My  best  analogy—because  the  Earth
sciences are somewhat different from the astrophysics, say Hubble,
my best analogy is the medical sciences. I think the Earth sciences
are in the same relationship. They have a responsibility for science,
because  they  are  scientists,  as  well  as  the  applications  of  that
science.

My concern is that the scientific part may be undermined. I cer-
tainly  recognize  that  we  have  to  look  at  this  collaboration  with
NOAA.  But  it  certainly  cannot  be  a  collaboration  of  centrally  mov-
ing  observational  capabilities  to  NOAA  and  not,  at  the  same  time,
bringing  new  observational  capabilities  into  the  agenda  with  rich
scientific  funding.  That  is  what  worries  me  is  that  there  could  be
a decline at NASA, and maybe even an increase at NOAA, but the
balance would not be right.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Dr. Killeen.
Dr.  KILLEEN.  NASA  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  fabric—the  intel-
lectual fabric of capacity and human capital in the Nation. I think
the AAAS mentions that NASA provides 34 percent of the funding
to  our  whole  national  Earth  science  capability,  environmental
sciences capability. So it is a dominant agency. But its role is—the
focus,  as  Berrien  points  out,  on  the  research,  on  the  seed  corn,  on
the new technologies, on the innovation that then can be extended
and  utilized  more  broadly  to  support  society  through  operational
capabilities.

And  I  think  the  history  has  shown  that  it  does  that  extremely
well.  The  doors  have  opened  on  plate  tectonics,  air  pollution,
weather,  climate,  many  of  the  examples  you  say  could  be  filled  up
with—there  are  numerous  examples  where  we  could  point  to
NASA’s  innovation  opening  intellectual  doors.  I  think  we  stand  at
a  point  in  history  where  the  work  of  the  past  decades  has  sug-
gested  that  we  need  to  take  this  life  science  analogy  and  look  at
the  Earth  as  a  system.  We  are  capable  of  looking  at  the  Earth  as
a  system  and  actually  investigating  its  metabolism,  its  function
across a whole range of parameters and factors. NASA will support
that.  NASA  is  probably  the  only  agency  in  the  world  that  has  the
wherewithal, the track record, and the access to the human capital
to make that happen. And that is going to be something that is so
important  for  future  generations,  and  it  is  going  to  drive  economic
benefits.

If  you  think  about  the  U.S.  economy,  roughly  B  of  it  has  some
sensitivity  to  environmental  change:  leisure,  tourism,  energy,
transportation. And we are going to need decision support systems

to  support  those  enterprises  that  take  into  account  the  changes
that occur locally, regionally, and globally as well.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Dr. Solomon.
Dr.  SOLOMON.  First  of  all,  I  agree  with  what  Dr.  Moore  and  Dr.

Killeen have said.

To me, NASA’s special role is the combination that they bring of
scientific  exploration  and  discovery  and  technological  innovation.
And I don’t think they are matched anywhere in the federal system
or  even  internationally.  That  gives  them  a  special  perspective,  an
opportunity to contribute to scientific issues.

And  as  previous  speakers  have  said,  the  scientific  issues  driving
Earth science are highly relevant to all of us who live on this plan-
et.  If  we  are  trying  to  understand  why  earthquakes  occur,  why—
where  they  do  and  when  they  do,  from  a  purely  scientific  stand-
point,  that  is  a  first-order  question  in  Earth  dynamics.  But  if  you
are living on a fault in California or Colorado or Oregon, it is more
than  an  academic  issue.  The  same  thing  can  be  said  about  other
natural  hazards  where  space  can  provide  a  perspective,  and  what
is  needed  are  new  ideas,  new  technologies,  new  observation  tools
to  open  up  the  discoveries  that  will  allow  us  to  understand  these
systems.  That  is  what  NASA  does  best.  And  I  see  NASA  playing
a  special  role  for  continued  investigation  of  the  Earth  for  the  fore-
seeable future.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Dr. McNutt.
Dr. MCNUTT. Yeah. NASA is simply the only civilian agency that
has the required capacity, tradition, and track record to undertake
the technology development to fuel tomorrow’s discoveries. Imagine
if we had a business community in the U.S. and we cut it off from
the venture capital completely. And imagine what would happen to
our  business  community.  That  is  exactly  what  you  would  be  doing
to Earth sciences. NASA provides that venture capital.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  like  your  style.  You  put  it  in  very  prac-
tical  terms.  But  I  want  to  make  sure  that  everyone  understands
this is not some esoteric discussion among scientists. This is some-
thing  that  has  very  real,  very  practical  implications  on  our  daily
lives,  as  Dr.  Williamson  pointed  out,  in  terms  of  billions  of  dollars
in  economic  activity  and  saved  lives  and  hundreds  of  millions  of
dollars in saved—Dr. Williamson?

Dr.  WILLIAMSON.  Oh,  I  think  to  echo  some  of  my  colleagues’
points,  the—a  lot  of  the  benefits  that  I  have  talked  about  in  my
testimony  and  other  people  this  morning  and  at  other  times  have
discussed,  started  the  understanding  that  you  needed  to  pursue
those practical benefits down the line really started at NASA. And
you  know,  I  know  when  I  worked  as  a  staff  member  for  the  Con-
gress  a  few  years  ago,  I  used  to  get  a  little  impatient  with  sci-
entists, my fellow scientists, who would come to us at the Office of
Technology  Assessment  or  in  one  of  these  hearings  and  argue  for
more money for science for the sake of science.

But in fact, I don’t see that happening. I see a very reasoned ex-
position in the National Research Council report that actually looks
in  detail  at  why  one  wants  to  support  certain  kind  of  critical  mis-
sions. And the GPM is certainly one of those.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Here is the situation. We have a call of the House for a vote. We
will  have  time  for  Mr.  Gordon’s  questions,  and  then  we  will  take
a  brief  recess  and  hope  we  can  get  back  in  a  timely  manner.  And
I  would  urge  all  of  my  colleagues  to  return.  This  is  a  very  impor-
tant hearing.
Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

EARTH SCIENCE CUTS

Mr.  Diaz,  I  recognize  that  your  job  here  today  is  to  defend  the
cuts  and  cancellations  that  NASA  has  made  to  the  Earth  science
budget, and you may feel like the victim of a drive-by shooting, but
these are all very legitimate concerns and questions. And they real-
ly—they  are  predicated  on  the  fact,  as  Mr.—or  Dr.  Killeen  pointed
out,  that  NASA  has  a  great  history  and  providing—and  you  have
been a part of it, of research that is real-world to the country, and
that we are afraid that this research and billions of dollars in foun-
dation could be irrevocably damaged here in this window. So these
are legitimate concerns.

With  that  said,  I  would  like  to  better  understand,  if  you  could
help me, NASA’s rationale for making some of the cuts. For exam-
ple,  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2006  funding  request  for  the  Combined
Earth-Sun  Science  Program  is  some  $645  million  lower  than  the
funding plan for fiscal year 2006 that was contained in NASA’s fis-
cal  year  2004  funding  request.  That  is  a  24-percent  reduction  in
NASA’s  Earth-Sun  Science  fiscal  year  2006  funding  plan  in  just
two years. Why did NASA decide to cut its planned funding request
for  the  Earth-Sun  Science  Program  so  much,  and  where  did  the
NASA-diverted funds go?

Or  take  another  example.  Just  last  year,  then-Administrator
O’Keefe  told  the  American  Meteorological  Society  that  we  hope  to
accelerate the flight of Glory Mission to as early as 2007 to provide
earlier  availability  to  this  space-based  pilometer.  Yet  we  now  find
that  fiscal  year  2006  budget  request  that  NASA  is,  in  fact,  can-
celing  the  Glory  spacecraft  and  has  no  clear  plan  for  flying  Glory
instruments  any  time  soon.  Was  Administrator  O’Keefe  mis-
informed,  or  was  the  money  intended  for  Glory  diverted  to  some
other purpose?

And  finally,  I  mention  NASA’s  decision  to  cut  the  out-year-fund-
ing  plan  for  Earth  science  contained  in  last  year’s  budget  request
by  a  significant  amount.  Why,  given  all  the  stresses  on  NASA’s
Earth  science  budget,  did  NASA  decide  to  cut  NASA’s  out-year
funding  plan  for  Earth  science  instead  of  taking  the  alternative
course  of  slowing  the  pace  of  new  exploration  initiative?  Mr.  Diaz?
Mr. DIAZ. Well, there are a lot of questions there. And if we have
the  time,  I  would  like  to  first  start  by  saying  I  find  myself  in  this
unusual position of being refreshed by the observations of everyone
in  the  panel  who  have  talked  about  the  wonderful  success  that
NASA has achieved. And as you said, it does feel good to have been
part of that.

And yet I also find myself in a situation where I can understand
the concern, because of the change in strategy that is taking place.

The reason that I feel more confident is largely because I believe
that  when  we  come  out  of  this  transition,  we  will  be  much  better
positioned to do the work that we have been doing in the past than
we  would  otherwise.  What  has  been  said  is  that  we  have  made
major investments over the past 15 to 20 years, and that is exactly
correct.  But  a  lot  of  that  investment,  I  would  hesitate  to  say  how
much of it, has gone into what I call infrastructure, platforms that
hold  instruments.  The  wonderful  achievements  that  people  are
talking  about  here  have  to  do  with  the  achievements  associated
with  the  instruments  that  fly  on  these  platforms.  The  platforms
themselves  are  very  similar  to  the  ones  that—if  not  identical,  to
the ones that NOAA flies for operational programs.

And so the strategy that we are on is one that would try to mini-
mize  the  investment  that  needs  to  be  made  by  the  government
overall  in  infrastructure  to  support  these  instruments.  And  many
of the changes that——

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  is  NOAA  going  to  be  given  the  funds  to  go

along with these additional——

Mr. DIAZ. NOAA already flies these platforms, and——
Mr.  GORDON.  So  there  is  no  additional  expense  that  will  be  in-

curred?

Mr. DIAZ. As I said in the past, I don’t have the particulars with
respect  to  the  NOAA  budget,  and  I  cannot  tell  you  whether  or
not——

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  don’t  you  think—I  mean,  that  is—you  are
saying  you  are  going  to  the  swimming  pool,  but  you  didn’t  check
to see if there is any water in it.

Mr. DIAZ. Well, I—we know that they are building the platforms,
and  it  is  not  clear  to  me  how  much  money  they  are  spending  on
them, but they are building the platforms.

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  one  of  the  things  that  I  have  been  very  en-
couraged by your conversation is you want to have an openness——

Mr. DIAZ. Right.
Mr.  GORDON.—and  a  dialogue.  Well,  don’t  you  think  part  of  this
dialogue  ought  to  be  checking  with  NOAA  and  with  the  Adminis-
tration?  I  mean,  but  even  if  what  you  are  saying  can  be  done  and
that there—and that basic science and applied science can be com-
bined here, it still has to be paid for.

Mr. DIAZ. Yes.
Mr.  GORDON.  So  I  mean,  I  am  not  even  sure  that,  again,  it  can
be  consistent.  But  even—but  if  your  premise  is  correct,  don’t  you
think  you  need  to  check  and  see  whether  or  not  it  is  going  to  be
funded and—as part of this dialogue you are having?

Mr.  DIAZ.  Well,  I  think  what  I—well,  we  have  assurances  and
have  gotten  assurances  that  the  development  of  the  platforms  has
been funded and that there is space on them for us. But I just use
that as a backdrop trying to get to answering your question.

There were—in the course of the past two fiscal years, your num-
bers are correct, and we have reduced overall in the Earth System
Science  as  well  as  the  Sun-Earth  Connection  combined,  by  that
amount  of  money.  If  you  look  at  what  we  did  in  Earth  sciences
alone, that is what was Earth science in 2004, because I can’t com-
pare—because  they  weren’t  combined  in  2004,  there  was  a  reduc-
tion taken in 2005 and virtually no reduction in 2006.

you have the time at this point.

we are down to four minutes.

Chairman BOEHLERT. When we have—we do have to go, because

Mr. DIAZ. Okay.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  will  resume,  at  this  point,  when  we
come  back.  But  I  just  would  like  to  observe,  you  talked  about  the
handoff——

Mr. DIAZ. Right.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—and I am enough of a track man to know
it  takes  two  hands  for  a  handoff.  And  one  hand  is  extending  to
hand off, but there has got to be a recipient with a plan and a pro-
gram  and  the  funding  behind  the  program.  And  so—and  we  don’t
see that.

So  we  will  take  a  brief  recess  and  be  back  as  soon  as  possible.
Mr. DIAZ. Thank you.
[Recess.]
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  will  resume,  and  before  recognizing
Mr. Calvert, before we were so rudely interrupted by the House de-
manding our presence there, we were having a very important dis-
cussion. And there is a minute left on Mr. Gordon’s time, and then
we will go to Mr. Calvert.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NASA AND NOAA

Mr.  GORDON.  I  guess  quickly,  Dr.  Moore,  would  you  like  to  re-

spond to Mr. Diaz’s comments?

Dr. MOORE. Yes. I think I know where you are going or what you
are thinking there. This relationship between NASA and NOAA, is
that what we are——

Mr.  GORDON.  And  also  following  up  on  the  Chairman’s  earlier
comment. In layman’s terms, what are the particular sciences that
we  could  lose?  I  mean,  are  we  going  to  have,  in  terms  of  weather,
agriculture, you know, what are some of the real-world——

Dr. MOORE. Right.
Mr. GORDON.—potential losses?
Dr.  MOORE.  As  I  tried  to  say  earlier,  I  think  that  the  partner-
ship,  the  long-standing  partnership  between  NASA  and  NOAA  is
one  of  the  most  valued  aspects  of  the  United  States  government.
It is almost unique in the world, and it is extraordinary. And I ap-
plaud anything to strengthen that.

However,  I  think  we  have  to  also  recognize  that  they  are,  by
mandate, very different agencies. NASA is a research and develop-
ment  agency.  NOAA  is  an  operational  agency.  NOAA  has  research
capability,  but  it  is  far,  far  smaller  than  the  significant,  as  Dr.
Killeen  pointed  out,  this  very  significant  research  capability  of
NASA.  My  analogy,  to  use  the  medical  one  again,  would  be  if  we
somehow said we were going to move—essentially remove the NIH
and  rely  on  the  hospitals  to  do  the  research,  granted  hospitals  do
research,  we  have  research  hospitals,  but  we  certainly  need  the
NIH.  I  think  in  the  same  vein  that  the  Earth  science  program  at
NASA  is  central  for  NOAA’s  long-term  viability  that  the—that  all
of  the  observational  capability,  such  at  NOAA,  first  came  through
NASA  and  that  that  train—or  that  theme  should  not  stop.  The

areas  of  research  we  are  just  beginning  to  understand  how  the  at-
mosphere is changing.

The point that Dr. McNutt made on climate variability, all of this
has come about in the last 10 or 12 years, and we still are just be-
ginning to understand it.

that  has  responsibility  for  the  wonderful  programs  within  NASA.

tunity to make a couple of comments and to ask a question.

I feel compelled to come to the defense of NOAA and the United
States Geological Survey. I used to chair that Subcommittee before
Mr.  Ehlers  and—for  a  number  of  years,  and  I  found  the  people  at
NOAA  and  USGS  to  be  top-rate,  and  some  of  the—and  there  is
science  taking  place  there.  I  think  that  some  folks  are  saying
that—if  you  would  listen  to  some  of  the  panelists,  you  wouldn’t
think  that  there  is  any  other  science  taking  place  other  than
NASA.

And  I  would  like  to  ask  Mr.  Diaz  a  question.  Has  the  Adminis-
tration ever said that they are going to get out of the Earth science
business?

Mr. DIAZ. No, they have not.
Mr. CALVERT. No, that is not what I have heard you say. You are
talking  about  a  national  policy  on  Earth  science,  which  I  think  is
an important thing. We a number of agencies—and I also serve on
the  Armed  Services  Committee.  The  United  States  Navy  is  doing
a  tremendous  amount  of  research.  We  have  the  National  Recon-
naissance Office. It is—it puts up satellites. As a matter of fact, we
have  one  coming  up  next  month  and  another  one  the  month  after
that.  We  have  a  number  of  agencies  doing  work,  and  I  suspect
those agencies are not talking to one another. I know they are not,
because I looked at a map of underwater—of the obstacles that we
deal  with  underwater.  I  suspect  the  Navy  has  done  a  lot  of  things
that  we,  unfortunately,  can’t  talk  about  or  look  at  that  are  signifi-
cantly  more  involved  than  what  NOAA  has  done  or  NASA  has
done, for obvious reasons.

And  so  we  need  to  have  more  interaction,  so  a  national  policy,
I  don’t  think,  is  a  bad  thing  to  pursue.  You  know,  change  is  hard
in  this  town.  And  I  do  agree  with  the  Chairman  that  we  should
never  make  strategic  decisions  based  on  budget  constraints.  Strat-
egy should always come first. That should always—whether it is on
the aeronautics side and having a vision for aeronautics as we have
on  a  vision  for  space,  which  I  certainly  support.  We  ought  to  have
a vision for Earth science and how we deal with that in the future.
But  Mr.  Diaz,  I  want  to  give  you  the  opportunity,  because  you
are kind of outnumbered here today, to defend the Administration’s
position  and  how  we  can  improve  science  and  improve  the  inter-
agency cooperation, which is not taking place today.

Mr.  DIAZ.  Well,  as  I  said,  I  do  find  myself  in  this  unusual  posi-
tion.  Having  worked  with  Berrien  Moore  for  so  many  years,  it  is
heartening to hear him say that—how much we value what NASA

has  done,  and  he  didn’t  say  anything  in  his  last  statement  that  I
disagree with.

I will say that I think there has been an awful lot of change tak-
ing  place  and  an  awful  lot  of  dialogue  between  the  agencies  that
is  documented  in  at  the  program  level  and  is  also  documented  in
assignments  that  come  from  nationally-directed  programs.  But  we
do not have a single place to point to that talks to the strategy that
NASA  and  NOAA  are  following  to  transition  to  this  new  environ-
ment. There is no intention that I have seen, nor do I see any evi-
dence,  of  NASA  abandoning  Earth  science.  This 
is  about
transitioning to a different way of doing it.

Mr.  CALVERT.  As  I  see  it,  a  better  way  of  managing  the  re-

sources, and to come out——

Mr. DIAZ. Absolutely.
Mr.  CALVERT.—with  a—hopefully,  a  better  outcome.  I  agree  that
NASA  should  not  be  a  single-purpose  agency,  but  it  should  have
priorities, and I think its number one priority is space exploration.
And  the  technology  to  get  the  satellites  in  orbit  at  low-Earth  orbit
or whatever orbit we choose to put it in to make sure that we have
the  ability  to  get  NOAA  or  any  other  agency  that  we  need  to  deal
with  the  ability  to  do  the  type  of  science  that  we  are  looking  at.
And  so  I  just  wanted  to  come  to  the  defense  of  NOAA  and  the
United  States  Geological  Survey  and  the  job  that  they  are  doing,
and  I  think  they  are  competent  folks  over  there.  And  I  hope  that
as  we  go  through  this  process,  that  we  recognize  the  good  work
that  they  are  doing  and  look  at  ways  we  can  do  a  better  way  of
interagency cooperation.

One  last  point.  NASA  lost  a  considerable  amount  of  business  in
the  last  number  of  years,  I  have  only  been  Chairman  of  this  com-
mittee  for  a  little  while,  to  the  Department  of  Defense.  For  what-
ever reason, the Department of Defense took it upon themselves to
do  research  in  aeronautics  and  space  design  outside  of  the  NASA
preview.  That  was  unfortunate,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  for  whatever
reason,  we  need  to  help  rebuild  that  relationship.  And  I  think  we
have a new Administrator that can look at the entire scope of what
NASA has done in the past, where have they gone and maybe lost
their  sight  of  where  they  need  to  go.  I  am  an  old  business  guy.  I
believe in business plans. And get them back on track. And I don’t
think the Administration is trying to hurt the Earth science indus-
try. I think they are trying to help it.

So with that, thank you for letting me have the time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you, Mr. Calvert.
And just let me say how much we value your continued contribu-
tions to this committee and its deliberations. I couldn’t agree more
with you that the national policy is very good in theory, and I want
to  have  that  national  policy.  And  Dr.  Moore,  I  hope  in  the  study
you  might  maybe  give  us  a  road  map  on  how  we  accomplish  this.
I  mean,  a  national  policy  makes  sense  for  a  nation.  But  maybe  it
is  NASA  doing  the  basic  research  and  maybe  the  applied  research
is  done  elsewhere.  That  is  part  of  a  coherent,  national  policy.  But
while  I  am  comforted  by  your  continued  commitment  to  Earth
science,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  when  you  said  to  Dr.  Moore  how
much  you  welcome  his  comments  on  how  valued  Earth  science  is,
I  welcome  those  comments,  too.  And  I  know  how  valuable  it  is.

That is why I hate to see the Earth science budget significantly re-
duced  because  of  the  great  value  in  very  real  terms  to  the  Nation
and its important impact on the Nation in practical terms, not just
theoretical discussions among scientists.

With  that,  let  me  recognize  the  distinguished  gentleman,  Mr.

Green.

Mr.  GREEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Ranking  Mem-
ber.  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  panel  that  we  have  assem-
bled,  the  witnesses.  Outstanding,  each.  And  I  think  that  you  have
given a neophyte a wealth of information, and I greatly appreciate
what you have shared with us.

GLORY

Mr. Chairman, if I may, I would like to refer to a table from the
NAS  report,  Table  3.1,  styled  canceled,  descoped,  or  delayed  Earth
observation missions. And I would like to just mention a few things
from this table, and I shall do so quickly.

Missions,  global  perception—pardon  me,  precipitation,  measure-
ment,  this  one  is  unclear,  atmospheric  surroundings—excuse  me,
soundings  from  geostationary  orbit  canceled.  Ocean  vector  winds,
canceled. LandSat data continuity, reformulated. And then Glory is
listed  as  unclear.  I  would  like  to  focus  on  Glory,  because  there  is
much talk about global warming. And there seems to be the notion
that it really does not exist. I was hoping that Glory would give us
additional feedback such that we could make some intelligent com-
ments  about  this  global  warming  debate  that  has  been  raging  in
our  country.  My  understanding  is  that  Glory  was  to  be  a  stand-
alone  mission  in  2008.  Thereafter,  there  was  talk  about  a  piggy-
back  mission,  that  is  with  another  mission  on-board,  with  another
mission.  And  I  see  now  that  there  is  an  NAS  Committee  interim
report, which addresses the possibility of it being suitable or capa-
ble of being timely placed with another satellite.

So  my  question  is,  after  much  consternation,  are  we  going  to
have  a  Glory  mission,  and  if  so,  what  type  of  timeline  should  we
expect?

Mr. DIAZ. Well, I assume that is for me.
Mr. GREEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. DIAZ. Okay.
Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Diaz.
Mr.  DIAZ.  Okay.  Yes,  we  do  have  plans  in  place  and  are  devel-
oping  the  elements  for  a  Glory  mission.  The  current  situation  is
that  the  budget  that  we  have  supports  the  development  of  the  in-
struments  for  a  Glory  mission  with  the  expectation  that  we  were
going  to  fly  those  on  a—one  of  the  NPOESS  satellites.  In  the  cur-
rent  situation,  with  the  review  ongoing  of  the  NPOESS  satellites,
we  decided  to  continue  the  development  of  a  spacecraft,  which  is
a  spacecraft  that  was  partially  built  and  is  being  built  by  Orbital
Sciences here in the Washington area. We are continuing that with
the expectation that over the course of the next several months we
will  make  a  decision  as  to  whether  or  not  to  fly  Glory  as  a  stand-
alone mission or to fly the instruments on a bus. If we fly it on a—
as a stand-alone mission, we will need to complete the development
of that spacecraft and then decide how to get it launched. But want
to assure you that we intend to fly the Glory mission and are con-

tinuing to develop the instrument. There is some uncertainty about
how we would ultimately get the instruments into space.

Mr. GREEN. And a quick follow-up, if I may, Mr. Chairman.
How  have  we  budgeted  the  mission,  because  if  we  are  not  sure
that  it  will  be  stand-alone  or  piggyback,  how  are  we  managing  to
budget that?

Mr.  DIAZ.  In  terms  of  the  runout,  we  have  budgeted  it,  excuse
me,  as  if  it  was  going  to  fly  on  one  of  the  NPOESS  satellites.  In
terms  of  this  fiscal  year,  the  budget  that  we  have  available  will
support the continuation of the bus development. And what we will
have  to  do,  if  we  decide  to  fly  it  as  a  stand-alone,  is  to  change  the
budget in the out-years during the fiscal year 2007 budget process.

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I yield back the remainder of my time.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And  I  just  want  to  make  sure  you  appreciate  the  fact  that  this
committee doesn’t think that global climate change, global warming
is a figment of somebody’s wild imagination. I might point out, nei-
ther  does  the  President.  He  recognizes  it  as  a  serious  issue,  as  he
should.  But  whether  you  are  for  or  against  on  that  argument,  the
fact of the matter is people on both sides recognize the importance
of what Mr. Diaz and his people are doing and we are hearing from
these distinguished scientists confirming the importance of that.

Thank you very much.
The Chair is pleased to recognize Dr. Schwarz.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

THE EFFECTS OF EARTH SCIENCE CUTS ON UNIVERSITIES

To  my  fellow  University  of  Michigan  Wolverine,  Dr.  Killeen,
many  universities  have  programs  in  Earth  science  and  topics  and
subjects that are pertinent to Earth science that are pretty well de-
veloped,  University  of  Michigan,  of  course,  being  one  of  them,  but
there  are  so  many  others.  If  NASA  continues  to  decrease  the  size
of  what  it  does  in  Earth  science  and  in  the  Earth  sciences,  how  is
that  going  to  affect  programs  in  places  like  Madison  or  Cambridge
or  Berkeley  or  Durham,  New  Hampshire  or  other  places?  Is  this  a
deleterious  effect,  or  does  life  go  on  without  NASA  going  heavily
into Earth science and aggressively into Earth science.

Dr.  KILLEEN.  I  think  that  there  is  a  potential  for  a  deleterious
effect on the development of human capital in universities, such as
University  of  Michigan,  and  other  places.  And  I  note  that  NASA
has  34  percent  of  the  national  investment  in  Earth  sciences.  Most
of  that  is—the  predominant  part  of  that  is  in  satellites,  platforms,
database management systems. But there is also a very significant
fraction in the research and analysis programs that extend into the
research  laboratories  in  the  universities  and  from  graduate  stu-
dents,  undergraduate  research  topics,  curriculum  development  ef-
forts  as  well.  And  those  are  very  vitally  important  programs,  I
think, across the Nation. So the research and analysis. And I think
at  the  last  reckoning  that  NASA  is,  like,  ranked  number  third  in
terms  of  federal  agencies  in  supporting  that  element  of  the  pro-
gram.

These  are  important  for  our  students  as  they  come  forward.  I
used to teach at the undergraduate level non-science majors, Earth

74

system  sciences,  and  I  can  tell  you  from  firsthand  experience  that
these young people coming forward in the universities are very in-
terested  in  how  the  Earth  functions,  what  is  going  on,  and  how
they  can  play  a  role.  We  used  to  talk  about  the  need  for  a  pre-life
course  sequence  as  well  as  a  pre-med.  course  sequence  in  these
major research universities. And the content of those curricular ele-
ments  are  similar  to  the  slides  that  we  have  been  showing  today:
sea  surface,  oceans,  atmospheres,  tectonic  plates.  NASA  has  pro-
vided  really  exciting  content  that  is  enrapturing  our  youth  and
building this human capital, and it is taking place across the coun-
try in research university campuses, certainly.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Can  I  deduce  from  that  that  there  would  be
fewer—and  Dr.  Moore,  please  jump  in,  if  you  feel  like  you  would
like to, there would be fewer graduate students, post-doctoral schol-
ars, research scientists on campuses were NASA to back off in their
Earth science pursuits?

Dr.  KILLEEN.  Well,  I  will  defer  to  Dr.  Moore,  but  certainly  if  the
funding  goes  down,  in  terms  of  research  grants  to  university  cam-
puses,  and  NASA  is  a  substantial  contributor  to  this  arena,  then
there  would  be  fewer  opportunities  for  graduate  students  to  come
forward.  And  those  are  the  very  individuals  that  we  expect  to  de-
sign  and  implement  the  new  technologies  that  will  be  transferred
to  NOAA  operationally  10,  15,  20  years  hence.  So  I  think  there  is
a pipeline of talent issue here.

Dr.  MOORE.  Well,  we  have  already  begun  to  sense  the  pressure
on  the  research  and  analysis  budget  and  how  that  pressure  trans-
lates  to  the  availability  of  graduate  fellowships.  And  even  though
the  fellowships  say  budgetarily  are  extremely  small,  under  pres-
sure, this begins to be felt, and we have already experienced it.

Mr. SCHWARZ. Thank you, sir.
And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would yield back.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Doctor.
The  Chair  recognizes  Mr.  Udall,  who  had  a  wonderful  opening
statement,  and  is  going  to  spare  us  the  reading  of  it.  It  will  be  in-
serted  in  the  record  with  all  of  the  other  wonderful  opening  state-
ments.

But now we will go with you for your wonderful questions.
Mr.  UDALL.  You  can  all  see  why  it  is  such  a  pleasure  and  how

wonderful it is to serve with Chairman Boehlert.

I did want to, in particular, welcome Dr. Killeen, and remind my
good  friend  from  the  State  of  Michigan  that  Dr.  Killeen  now  lives
in  my  hometown  of  Boulder,  Colorado,  and  I  don’t  think  he  has
gone to the dark side and supports the Colorado University teams,
but——

Mr. SCHWARZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Were  he  still  in  Michigan,  I  believe  he  lived  in  Dexter,  and  he

would be a constituent of mine.

Dr. KILLEEN. No need to fight over me.

LANDSAT

Mr.  UDALL.  I  want  to  direct  my  questions  at  Mr.  Diaz  on  the
LandSat  situation,  but  I  did  want  to  acknowledge  Dr.  McNutt,  in
particular,  on  the  second  page  of  your  statement,  where  you  talk
about  some  of  the  long-term  lessons  you  have  put  into  place.  And

I  think  the  Committee  and  the  community  would  be  well-advised
to  take  a  look  at  what  you  have  discovered.  So  thank  you.  And  I
think it—there is an application across the board.

Mr.  Diaz,  I  mentioned  LandSat,  and  as  you  know,  the  current
LandSat  7  is  now  past  its  design  life  and  operating  in  a  degraded
condition.  How  much  longer  do  you—your  engineers  estimate  that
LandSat VII will remain operational?

Mr. DIAZ. If you don’t mind, I have Dr. Asrar here with me who
has been intimately involved in that, and I would ask him to come
to  the  table  and  answer  that  specific  question,  if  you  don’t  mind.
Mr.  UDALL.  If  you  could  do  it  with  dispatch,  it  would  be  appre-

ciated.

point.

Mr. DIAZ. Yeah. He is right here.
Mr. UDALL. We would like to hear from him.
Dr.  ASRAR.  Thank  you  very  much.  My  name  is  Ghassem  Asrar,
the  Deputy  Associate  Administrator  in  the  Science  Mission  Direc-
torate.

We  have  been  working  with  our  partners,  NOAA  and  USGS,  to
do  a  complete  assessment  of  the  life  expectancy,  the  reliability  of
the  system.  The  current  projection  is  that  probably  maybe  two  or
three  more  years,  although  those  are  estimates.  The  same  esti-
mates that were used for LandSat 5, and we had projected LandSat
5  will  not  last  longer  than,  probably  eight  or  nine  years.  This  is—
I  believe  it  is  celebrating  its  15th  birthday.  So  these  are  engineer-
ing  estimates.  Probably,  maybe  two  to  three  more  years.  And  then
in parallel, we are looking at other sources of data to mitigate any
risks associated with the discontinuity, should it come to pass. And
so  we  are  preparing  for  the  worst  and  hoping  for  the  best,  as  we
will work our way toward the transitioning the LandSat capability
into the national operational infrastructure.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you  for  enlightening  us  in  that  particular

I noticed concern about a gap that may be produced that you are
speaking  to,  but  I  want  to  ask  Dr.  Williamson,  what  user  groups
would  be  most  affected  if  there  is  a  gap  in  the  flow  of  this  data.
Dr.  WILLIAMSON.  Well,  there  is  a  wide  variety  of  user  groups
throughout  the  world  that  use  LandSat  data  for  environmental
monitoring.  As  you  know,  the  swath  width  and  the  resolution  size
of  each  pixel  in  the  image  is  much  broader  than  it  is  for,  say,  the
commercial  high-resolution  satellites.  And  that  has  an  advantage,
if you are doing exploration of the coasts and understanding large-
scale  issues  that  are  taking  place  along  the  coasts  or  inland.  In
your State of Colorado, for example, LandSat imagery was very im-
portant  in  the  fires  that  occurred,  what,  now  three  years  ago,  I
believe——

Mr. UDALL. Yes.
Dr. WILLIAMSON.—just south of you. And it—those images really
helped to understand the scope of the fire and the way it was pro-
gressing over a considerable amount of time. So you find a tremen-
dous  usage  of  those  data  throughout  the  world  in  similar  kinds  of
projects.  So  losing  LandSat  would  be  a  serious  issue  in  part  be-
cause it is a unique instrument. There aren’t other instruments ex-
actly  like  it.  So  it  means  that  on  the  operational  side,  it  becomes
very  difficult  to  take  the  data  that  you  have  been  used  to  using

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

from  LandSat  and  then  substitute  other  data  and  get  the  equiva-
lent  results.  Other  examples  I  could  site  would  be  down  in  Brazil,
for  example,  watching  the—tracking  the  deforestation  in  Brazil.
The same thing in Russia and other parts of the world. And as has
been  already  said,  the  environmental—major  environmental
changes  that  take  place  elsewhere  in  the  world  affect  us  as  well.
And we need to understand those better.

Mr.  UDALL.  Yeah.  Well,  the  old  saying,  ‘‘We  are  all  downwind

from everybody else in the world.’’

If  the  Chairman  might  indulge  me  just  for  another  question  di-

rected back at NASA and Mr. Diaz.

Given  what  we  have  heard  and  I  think  what  we  understand
about  LandSat,  what  are  you  doing  to  address  this  potential  data
gap,  and  how  much  money  are  going  to  budget  to  obtain  LandSat-
like data from alternative sources?

Mr.  DIAZ.  Again,  Dr.  Asrar  is  involved  in  actually  working  that,

so let me ask him to come back and talk about that.

Mr. UDALL. If I could, too, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit

some additional questions to NASA——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Sure. That would be——
Mr.  UDALL.—along  this  line  of  questioning,  but  if  we  have  a

tunity.

minute to hear——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Sure.  As  all  Members  of  the  Committee
are going to be afforded that opportunity, and we would appreciate,
obviously, timely responses.

Doctor?
Dr.  ASRAR.  Mr.  Chairman,  and  again,  thank  you  for  the  oppor-

Given  the  sort  of  broad  reach  of  LandSat,  its  utility  throughout
the  government,  we  at  NASA  haven’t  been  doing  this  unilaterally.
We  have  been  working  with  all  of  our  sister  agencies  and  the  Of-
fices of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop a na-
tional  plan  for  dealing  with  the  potential  data  gap.  And  all  of  the
users  are  at  the  table:  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  U.S.  Geo-
logical  Survey,  Department  of  Interior,  and  NOAA.  So  the  plan
that  we  are  developing,  given  that  it  is  a  work  in  progress,  we
thought  of  scoping  what  is  required  and  what  are  the  sources  of
data  and  which  part  of  the  data  could  be  obtained  through  inter-
national  cooperations.  For  example,  the  33-year  record  of  LandSat
data is something that everybody is benefiting from. But there are
other nations, like India and, as of late, China, who have developed
comparable  capabilities.  They  have  these  type  of  observations.  On
the EOS spacecraft, there is an instrument called ASTER that has
comparable LandSat capability with much reduced swath, about 60
kilometers. We have another technology demonstration satellite on
orbit  called  Earth  Observer  I  that  has  comparable  LandSat  capa-
bilities.  So  we  are  going  to  bring  all  of  the  data  sources  together,
regardless  of  whether  the  government-owned  or  internationals  to
fulfill  the  LandSat  data  continuity  needs,  and  depending  on  what
are the best solutions, identify the resources within the government
to fulfill that. The major commitment is to maintain the continuity
and whatever resources are required to make it happen, I am pret-
ty sure our government will be up to supporting that.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Doctor.  I  think  we  are  all  concerned  on
this panel that data conversion, that data integration is still a very
complicated  and  challenging  one,  and  I  think  Dr.  Williamson  put
it very, very well.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  I  don’t  want  to  destroy  the  wonderful
spirit  that  we  have  at  work  here,  but  I  do  have  some—a  couple
pointed  questions,  maybe.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  it  might  be  nice  to
have  at  least  one  person  on  the  panel  who  can  actually  stimulate
the discussion by having a different point of view. And just my sug-
gestion in the future.

Chairman BOEHLERT. We always rely on you for that.

CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right. I just can’t tell you how, you know,
just  enlightening  it  is  to  understand  that  we  are  still  considering
another  global  warming  mission.  You  know.  Glory.  I  mean,  just—
I mean, how many billions of dollars do we have to spend on this?
I  mean,  is  it  actually  going  to  change  global  warming  to  have  yet
another satellite up there? My calculations since I have been here,
that we have spent tens of billions of dollars trying to prove global
warming, and every budget that we pass has this. And let me note
something  that  happened,  Mr.  Chairman,  when  I  first—not  when
I  first  came  here,  but  sort  of  a  few  years  into  my  tenure  on  this
committee. A very high ranking official from NOAA came to see me
to  tip  me  off  that  El  Nin˜ o  was  going  to  happen  in  six  months  and
it  would  hit  California.  You  know,  we  would  hit  it  in  about  six
months  and  the  effect  that  it  would  have.  And  let  me  note  he  was
exactly  right.  And  that  was—it  really  impressed  me.  And  I  said,
‘‘Gee,  these  guys  really  are  focusing  on  some  things  that  are  use-
ful.’’  And  being  a  surfer  and  everything  like  that,  I  really  wanted
to know the water was going to be warmer and the—more fish and
there  might  be  some  forest  fires  because  of  the  rain  coming  down,
et cetera.

Anyway,  the  same  fellow,  by  the  way,  in  a  hushed  voice,  leaned
over  to  me  and  said,  ‘‘Just  to  let  you  know,  but  don’t  tell  anybody
that  I  told  you,  but  all  of  these  calculations  about  global  warming
that  they  have  made  so  far,  they  haven’t  taken  into  consideration
the cloud cover on the days that the temperatures were taken. You
think  that  might  have  something  to  do  with  whether  or  not  they
have  a  valid  calculation?’’  And  then—he  was  afraid  to  say  that  in
public, but he sort of whispered in my ear. I just—you know, it just
amazes me when you hear that so much what I would have to say
is  just  fear,  expressions  of  fear  when  the  President  starts  talking
about  making  just  a  restructuring  of  how  we  house  and  where  we
put research in the government.

Let me ask Dr. McNutt. I mean, you stated—I mean, this goes—
this  is  something  that  I  just  would  like  to  know  how  you  justify
this that somewhere from its root of the technological program that
feeds  innovation,  the  program  would  eventually  die  and  wither—
or  wither  and  die.  Aren’t  there  just  research  programs  that  don’t
have  to  also  have  people  who  put  machines  together?  And  what

78

makes you think that all research is going to wither and die if not
tied directly to the technology that implements the research?

Dr.  MCNUTT.  What  I  meant  by  that  is  that  if  we—all  we  need
to do is take the same sensors we already have and continue to fly
them  in  space  with  no  changes,  no  upgrading,  then  we  probably
could  hand  those  off  to  another  agency  and  put  it  just  in  mainte-
nance mode. But I don’t think anyone on this panel would support
the  idea  that  there  won’t  be  newer  and  better  measurements  that
really  need  to  be  made  to  answer  some  of  those  questions.  For  ex-
ample,  you  bring  up  the  issue  of  cloud  cover.  Cloud  cover  has  to
do with aerosols. Aerosols are one of the most, right now, unknown
parts  of  the  climate  formula.  And  putting  new  sensors  in  space
would allow us to take some of those hushed questions that you are
hearing  behind  closed  doors  and  actually  answer  them  so  that  we
can make predictions for climate change.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  guess  all  of  those  clouds,  you  know,  in  the
past that people talked about before we had aerosol cans were just
not  really  relevant  to  whether  or  not  the  Earth  has  changed  its
weather patterns over these last——

Dr.  MCNUTT.  Well,  we  are  talking  about  aerosols  not  in  aerosol

cans, so to speak.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. Let me note that other testimony that
I have heard here indicates that a lot of our investment that we—
that even NASA already has in space, you know, our Earth Observ-
ing  System,  et  cetera,  that  we  have  enormous  unanalyzed  data.
Isn’t this a travesty that here we are talking about how important
it  is  to  keep  NASA  in  the  loop,  but  here  it  has  organized  itself  in
a  way  that  the  product  of  what  we  are  getting  out  of  the  invest-
ment,  a  huge  amount  of  this  data  remains  unanalyzed?  Why—
wouldn’t  we  think  that  perhaps  it  might  be  better  to  give  some
other  agency  that  is  actually  more  oriented  towards  analysis  and
research some authority here rather than just keep giving it to the
engineers that run NASA? Go right ahead. I mean——

Dr. MOORE. I would like to comment on that.
I think that there was a time when your statement was true. But
I  don’t  think  that  is  the  current  situation.  And  I  believe  that  it  is
not  the  current  situation  because  of  actions  of  NASA  and  also  of
the  technological  infrastructure  of  the  United  States  and  the  plan-
et.  Today,  undergraduates  and  high  school  students  and  graduate
students,  and  even  aging  professors,  look  at  NASA  data  every  day
on  our  desktop.  It  is  remarkably  easy  to  analyze  these  fire  hoses
of data, which 10 or 20 years ago, with punch cards, it was a very
tough thing to do. So in a sense, modern society has caught up with
Earth observation. And I do think you were correct in your assess-
ment, but I don’t believe it is where we are today.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  does  that  still  mean  NASA  has  to  con-

tinue to be the vehicle? I mean, I just—it——

Dr.  MOORE.  I  think  the  issue  here  is  that  NASA  is  the  primary

R&D Earth observing organization. And as such——

RESEARCH PRIORITIES

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  the  question  is  whether  it  should  be  or
not.  I  mean,  when  we  are  talking  about—NASA  has  its  missions,
you  know,  and  here  we  have—it  has  evolved  into  what  it  is  today.

And  when—I  don’t  imagine  there  is  anyone  on  the  panel  that
would  disagree  with  a  hypothesis  that  there  is  some  research  that
the government pays for that is less deserving than other research.
I  mean,  I  imagine  there  are—even  among  a  panel  that  is  so  com-
mitted  to  assign  money  for  research,  there  is  some  research  that
would  be  better—the  money  might  be  used  elsewhere.  Well,  when
you  restructure—and  like  the  President  is  talking  about,  that  is
when  you  get  rid  of  things  that  aren’t  worthy  of  the  investment.
That  is  where  you  make  your  choices  as  to  what  should  have  pri-
ority. And if you never restructure, it is just going to continue like
it is, which is yet another global warming project, yet another glob-
al warming project rather than having a—or whatever the projects
are,  rather  than  trying  to  find  out  what  things  are  more  valuable
with  the  use  of  government  money.  When  I  was—I  am  sorry  I  am
going  on  here,  but  let  me  just  note  this  that  when  I  first—when
we  first  got  the  majority  and  I  was  the  Chairman  of  the  Sub-
committee on Environment and Research—and Energy Research, I
looked over all of the different projects that were being funded, and
I said, ‘‘How are we going to cut the budget, and how are we going
to  make  sure  the  money  is  being  best  spent?’’  And  I  just  looked
down  and  said,  ‘‘Which  one  of  these  projects  is  spending  the  most
money and having the least results?’’ And it happened—I know ev-
erybody  is  going  to  get  mad,  fusion  energy  happened  to  come  up,
and  of  course,  the  academic  community  has  never  forgiven  me  for
that.  But  the  fact  is,  they  hadn’t  come  up  with  the  results  that
other  people  were  coming  up  with.  And  shouldn’t  we  have  a  re-
structuring,  in  some  way,  that  lets  people  use  our  science  money
in  the  most—and  channel  it  towards  the—actually  the  most  suffi-
cient rather than keeping on—always keeping on the project. Once
it  is—you  know,  once  it  is  funded,  it  has  eternal  life.  And  I  will
leave that question with the panel. But——

Mr. SCHWARZ. [Presiding] The gentleman’s time has expired.
The gentleman from North Carolina——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. If the Chair would indulge Dr. Killeen, just—

he had something he wanted to say about that.

Mr. SCHWARZ. University of Michigan, anything. Keep it brief.
Dr.  KILLEEN.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  very  much  for  those  chal-

lenging comments.

I think, on the panel, we are talking about an end-to-end system
of  research—education,  research  innovation,  transition  to  oper-
ations,  support  for  the  societal  needs.  They  are  quite  practical,  in
fact. The element that we are emphasizing, because we were asked
to,  was  the  NASA  element,  which  has  been  the  R&D,  the  tech-
nology  development,  the  invention  of  new  instrument  types,  et
cetera,  as  opposed  to  the  deployment  of  operational  systems.  So
that  said,  I  think  if  we  were—and  we  could  all  defend  NOAA.  In
fact,  my  institution  works  closely  with  NOAA  on  next-generation
weather forecasting and all sorts of things, and they are great peo-
ple and do a wonderful job.

But  if  you  think  about  the  NASA’s  past  contribution,  which  we
have  tried  to  highlight,  in  terms  of  technological  innovation  that
has  meaning,  for  prediction  of  El  Nin˜ o,  for  prediction  of  the  five-
day weather forecast, for the prediction of what is going to happen
in the next two hours in an airport when you are landing, for pre-

diction  of  next  season’s  thermal  structure  in  the  Northeast  where
the natural gas needs to deploy natural gas on a delivery, those are
all  things  that  society  needs  for  which  we  need  a  knowledge  base.
And  I  think  what  might  be  at  risk  if  NASA  pulls  back  from  its
R&D  mission  in  the  Earth  sciences,  is  developing  that  knowledge
base  that  will  support  those  kind  of  systems  and  tools  into  the  fu-
ture. And I could go on on this, but I won’t.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  The  gentleman  from  North  Carolina,  Mr.  Miller.
Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

TRMM

Just  following  up  on  that,  there  have  been  several  members  of
the panel, and of this committee, who have pointed to Earth obser-
vation  as  not  something  that  simply  satisfies  a  curiosity  of  aca-
demics or as, perhaps, and employment program for academics, but
it  has  a  definite  application.  And  certainly  in  weather  forecasting,
it  is  useful  to  look  at  the  comparison.  This  last—of  where  we  are
now and where we have been. This last year, we had an unusually
active  hurricane  season.  I  think  most  of  us  who  live  on  the  East
Coast  watch  with  fascination  the  storms  form  on  the  west  coast  of
Africa  and  march  across,  westward  across  the  Atlantic,  and  make
landfall  here.  We  had  at  least  two  storms  that  were  category  four,
which is an unusually powerful hurricane. Hurricane Charlie hit—
made  landfall  in  Florida.  It  was  a  category  four.  It  resulted  in  31
deaths,  which  is,  of  course,  tragic.  Hurricane  Ivan  also  struck  as
a  weak  category  four  and  resulted  in  49  deaths,  including  10  in
North  Carolina,  largely  as  the  result  of  flooding  from  heavy  rains.
And of course, that was tragic, too.

But  the  comparison  of  the  kind  of  damage  that  came  earlier  in
our  history  when  we  were  much  less  populated  but  did  not  see  it
coming  is  dramatic.  In,  I  am  sorry,  1893,  a  storm  of  unknown  in-
tensity made landfall in Louisiana. The estimate is that there were
2,000  deaths  from  that  storm.  That  same  year,  again,  a  storm  of
unknown  intensity,  made  landfall  in  South  Carolina  and  Georgia.
The estimate of the loss of life is at 21,000. And of course, in 1900,
the—what  we  now  estimate  to  be  a  category  four  storm,  hit  Gal-
veston without warning and resulted in eight to 12,000 deaths. And
in  1928,  a  storm  struck  with  very,  very  little  warning  in  Florida
and  resulted  in  1,800  deaths.  That  is  a  striking  contrast,  the  level
of  loss  of  life  that  we  suffered  when  we  did  not  see  it  coming  and
could  not  prepare  versus  what  we  see  coming—versus  where  we
are  now  versus  where  we  were  then  in  our  ability  to  prepare  and
how  much  difference  it  makes.  And  I  certainly  do  hope  that  we
grown  in  our  ability  to  foresee  other  natural  disasters  and  to  fore-
cast them to predict their—predict and prepare.

Mr.  Diaz,  I  had  a  couple  of  questions  about  what  NASA  has  de-
cided, in at least one case, and more importantly, I think, how you
decide.  Last  year,  Japan  announced  that  it  was  withdrawing  from
the  partnership  for  the  Tropical  Rainfall  Monitoring  Mission,
TRMM,  and  NASA  initially  announced  that  it  would  discontinue
TRMM,  even  during  that  hurricane  season.  And  the  evidence,  I
think, or the belief of scientists is that the information from TRMM
has aided in the forecasting of hurricanes, their intensity, and their
path and I think largely because of the intervention of Members of

Congress.  Mr.  Boehlert  wrote  a  letter,  Chairman  Boehlert  wrote  a
letter.  Mr.  Lampson  from  Texas,  who  I  think  was  then  Chair  of
the—or rather Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Space and
Aeronautics  wrote  a  letter  to  object  and  ask  at  least  that  TRMM
continue  in  operation  through  the  end  of  that  hurricane  season.
Dr.—or  rather  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  is  that  the  correct  name,
who  is  the  Undersecretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmos-
phere,  which  I  think  has  jurisdiction  over  NOAA,  wrote  to  Mr.
O’Keefe and asked and said given our growing dependence on these
NASA  satellite  instruments,  I  would  appreciate  an  opportunity  to
work  with  you  to  develop  a  more  formal  mechanism  for  dialogue
with  NASA  as—well  in  advance  of  any  termination  date  for  re-
search data streams.

Mr. Diaz, you said that there is an awful lot of dialogue, I think
was your phrase earlier, with the other agencies that depend upon
NASA.  Is  there  now—actually,  Admiral  Lautenbacher  asked  for  a
joint working group. And it is apparent that he thought that NOAA
had  been  left  in  the  lurch,  simply  being  told  that  NASA  was  dis-
continuing the TRMM project.

What  are  current  plans  for  TRMM,  one?  And  then  second,  are
you  doing  anything  to  develop  that  formal  mechanism  for  dialogue
so  that  the  other  agencies  that  depend  upon  NASA  do  not  simply
find  out  from  reading  the  newspapers  that  NASA  is  discontinuing
programs that they depend upon?

Mr. DIAZ. Thank you for that question.
And let me start by saying what the current status is of TRMM.
Just—TRMM  is  currently  being  operated,  as  it  always  has  been,
and  it  will  continue  to  be  operated  until  such  time  as  either  one
of  two  situations  occur:  either  it  becomes  clear  that  it  will  exceed
the hazard criteria associated with uncontrolled reentry that NASA
policy  requires  for  us  to  take  action  at,  or  until  it  becomes  clear
that  it  is  no  longer  valuable  as  a  resource  or  is  less  valuable  than
is worth continuing.

Now  I  will  say  that  in  the  case  of  the  former,  we  have  some
standards,  and  we  have  continued  to  look  at  the  condition  of  the
satellite  and  its  ability  to  do  a  controlled  reentry  and  have  always
had that capability.

In  the  case  of  the  latter,  that  is  the  value  associated  with  it,
there  was  no  formal  process  in  place  that  had  us  interacting  with
NOAA or, for that matter, the rest of the community.

In  the  case  of  TRMM,  there  was  a  joint  working  group  put  to-
gether under the auspices of OSTP, and we came to the conclusion
that  TRMM  ought  to  be  continued  as  long  as  there  was  no  hazard
associated  with  it.  And  so  we  are  in  the  process  of  continuing  to
monitor  when  that  action  would  have  to  be  taken,  the  de-orbit  ac-
tion.

But  in  the  case  of  this  value  issue,  we  have  put  in  place  what
is  called  a  senior  review  process,  which  is  much  the  same  as  the
review process that we have in space science that will periodically,
typically  every  several  years,  look  at  the  continued—or  look  at  the
fleet of missions that are available to continue and prioritize them
with  respect  to  continuing  them  from  the  standpoint  of  scientific
value.  And  in  fact,  as  we  sit  here,  the  first  of  those  senior  reviews
for the Earth science satellites is currently ongoing.

In  terms  of  what  the  expectation  is  with  respect  to  TRMM,  we
think within the next several months we will have to make a deci-
sion  about  deorbiting  the  TRMM  mission.  And  if  you  don’t  mind,
I  would  ask  Dr.  Asrar,  who  has  more  details,  if  you  need  anymore
details, to go beyond that.

Mr. SCHWARZ. Thank you.
The gentleman from Michigan, Dr. Ehlers.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to mention briefly that before my colleague from Cali-
fornia,  Mr.  Rohrabacher  left,  I  entered  his  rhetorical  question
about how many more missions we would need on global warming,
and  I  said,  ‘‘We  will  probably  keep  doing  them  until  you  believe  it
is true.’’ And I told him he had the power to stop the missions.

TRANSFERRING EARTH SCIENCE FROM NASA TO NOAA

Having  said  that,  Earth  science  is  a  very  important  part  of
NASA,  and  I  have  to  say,  even  though  I  am  a  scientist,  when  this
was  first  discussed,  I  thought,  ‘‘That  is  kind  of  a  waste  of  money.
Why should we waste all of that space hardware on Earth observa-
tion?’’ But I was dead wrong, because there is so much you can do
from  space  in  terms  of  Earth  observations.  And  we  often  tend  to
neglect,  as  I  did  in  my  initial  response,  neglect  our  own  planet.  A
good example of that is we had several thousand people now climb
Mt.  Everest.  We  had  100  or  more—several  hundred  astronauts  go
into  space,  and  we  have  only  had  two  people  exploring  the  depths
of  the  ocean  really  at  very  significant  depths.  We  tend  to  neglect
our  own  planet.  And  I,  during  the  Easter  recess,  gave  lectures  at
two  major  universities  on  different  parts  of  the  country,  but  these
are both on the top of American universities. And in both cases, the
Earth  scientists  sought  me  out  and  said,  ‘‘We  are  very  concerned
about  what  is  going  to  happen  with  Earth  science  if  NASA  pulls
the plug.’’

Well,  I  understand  you  are  not  quite  pulling  the  plug,  but  you
are  saying,  ‘‘We  will  just  move  it  over  to  NOAA.’’  NOAA  does  not
have  the  capability  at  this  point.  You  can’t  simply  expect  that  if
new  sensors  are  developed  we  can  just  plop  them  on  one  of  the
weather  satellites.  There  is  compatibly  issues,  scheduling  issues.  I
think  it  is—in  view  of  NASA’s  excellent  record  on  Earth  observa-
tion, they have to continue to be involved, and not just say, ‘‘Okay,
we  will  help  design  the  sensors.  We  will  put  them  up  into  space,
but it is going to be your satellites. You have to manage that some-
how.’’ I am really concerned, too. It sounds as if NASA—NOAA has
not  been  heavily  involved  in  any  way  in  the  planning  of  this.  If  I
am  mistaken  on  that,  I  would  like  to  know.  But  it  sounds  to  me
like  the  real  problem  is  that  NASA  is  low  on  money  because  you
have  been  given  big  new  missions,  and  you  don’t—weren’t  given
the money to do it, so you are cutting and scraping as much as you
can  to  get  rid  of  what  you  regard  as  non-essential  to  the  new  mis-
sions.  And  I  believe  it  is  very  important  for  you  to  continue  to  be
heavily involved in Earth science.

And  so  I  just  think  it  is  essential  for  us  to  keep  a  robust  Earth
Observation  System  going  and  both  at  NOAA  and  at  NASA.  They
are complementary. And if we are going to transfer over to NOAA,
what  you  suggested  could  go  over  to  them,  we  are  going  to  have

83

to  transfer  some  money  from  NASA  to  NOAA  to  do  it,  because  we
are  not  going  to  find  any  new  money  these  days.  Since  they  are
both  in  the  same  Appropriation  Subcommittee,  I  suspect  it  would
be quite easy to make that transfer.

So  if  you  are  trying  to  save  money,  you  may  not  end  up  saving
money  by  doing  this.  I  would  be  happy  to  listen  to  any  responses
from anyone on the panel.

Mr. DIAZ. Well, I would like to make sure that we don’t leave the
impression  that—number  one,  that  this  is  being  done  unilaterally.
We  are  in  conversation  with  NOAA  very  frequently,  and  we  do
have  agreements  in  place  for  many  of  the  elements  individually.
What  we  don’t  have  in  place  is  an  overall  strategy  that  is  articu-
lated  that  does  what  I  have  mentioned.  And  so  I  do  think  that  if
NOAA  were  sitting  here  today,  they  would  recognize  the  fact  that
the things that we are talking about transferring or the things that
we  are  talking  about  doing  jointly,  and  I  would  rather  think  of  it
as  things  that  we  are  talking  about  doing  jointly  as  opposed  to
sending them things that we ought to be doing——

Mr.  EHLERS.  I  hope  you  would,  but  I  would  also  point  out  some-
thing else you don’t have, and that is the approval of the Congress.
Please remember that.

Mr. DIAZ. Okay.
Mr. EHLERS. You may proceed.
Mr.  DIAZ.  And  the—in  any  event,  I  just  wanted  to  make  sure
that  we  did  register  that  NOAA  is  involved  in  these  conversations
and I think would acknowledge that, if they were here.

Mr. EHLERS. I appreciate that.
Anyone else wish to comment then?
Dr. Killeen? Anything from Michigan.
Dr. KILLEEN. Repeating theme.
I  would  like  to  comment  on  that.  The  central  point  of  my  testi-
mony,  for  example,  today  is  that  a  fundamental  restructuring  of
the  national  program,  which  is  what  we  are  talking  about  here,
should  be  done  very  carefully,  deliberatively,  with  appropriate  as-
sessment of the effective contributions of the component parts. I do
believe that the NRC decadal survey that is being commissioned by
NASA and NOAA is a critically important part of that. It will take
time  to  fully  come  to  grips  with  it.  We  are  not  looking  at  the  final
report  here,  and  I  am  not  part  of  that  panel.  I  am  on  the  outside.
But  that  assessment,  I  think,  is  essential  to  be  so  that  all  of  the
‘‘I’’s  are  dotted  and  all  of  the  ‘‘T’’s  are  crossed  and  so  there  is  con-
fidence in the communities that are invested in this and in the Na-
tion  that  we  will  be  able  to  proceed  forward  with  this  big  enter-
prise.

Mr. EHLERS. Anyone else?
Yes, Dr. Williamson.
Dr.  WILLIAMSON.  I  think  nobody  on  this  panel  would  disagree
with  the  importance  of  occasionally  restructuring  how  we  think
about  our  research  and  applications  effort  in  Earth  science,  but  I
do think that we differ in detail on some of these matters probably,
but in general, I feel that dropping or delaying longer missions like
GPM and so forth, which are very important, not only to research,
but  to  helpful  and  beneficial  applications  is  probably  not  the  way
to go.

Mr. EHLERS. All right. I thank all of you, and I want to reassure
you, Mr. Diaz, this—my questions and statements probably sound-
ed  antagonistic.  They  were  not  intended  to  be  that  so  much  as  a
warning.  This  is  something—we  regard  this  as  a  very  major
change, and it is going to take a good deal of work, hard work and
coordination between yourself and NOAA, if it is to take place, and
also the concurrence, and I would also say, involvement of both the
research community and the Congress.

I—as  a  research  scientist,  I  know  how  complicated  research
science is and how essential it is to plan well. And it can’t be some-
thing that is just done because you want to get out from under the
financial  burden.  I  hope  it  is—the  goal  on  your  part,  as  well  as
NOAA’s  is  to  improve  the  science  that  is  done.  And  if  you  can  do
that  and  improve  efficiency  at  the  same  time,  we  will  certainly  be
open to looking at that.
Thank you very much.
Mr. DIAZ. Well, thank you, Mr. Ehlers.
Mr. SCHWARZ. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. Costa from California.
Mr. COSTA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

USE OF EARTH SCIENCE PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THE WATER

SUPPLY

I,  too,  share  a  similar  feeling  that  the  gentleman  from  Michigan
expressed that I think many of the Members of this committee feel
in terms of the prioritization for the Earth sciences program within
NASA’s budget.

I  have  been  informed  that  Dr.  Williamson  and  perhaps  Dr.
Killeen might be best to address a question that I have. For many
years,  I  have  been  involved  on  the  application  of  addressing  Cali-
fornia’s  current  and  long-term  water  needs.  We  have  a  saying  in
California  that  water  is  the  lifeblood  of  our  state  and  if  you  want
to  understand  how  California  has  developed  economically  and  so-
cially,  you  can  trace  it  to  one  resource  issue,  and  that  is  how  we
have managed our water resources.

But  I  think  it  is  applicable,  frankly,  as  it  relates  to  the  world.
I think one of the sweeping issues we have today is the availability
of  water  to  sustain  our  population  throughout  the  world  and  not
only  for  communities  for  water  quality,  but  also  to  provide  for  our
crops, which obviously provides the sustenance.

I  am  concerned,  Dr.  Williamson,  about  the  applicability,  as  we
look at our water management tools in our water toolbox, about the
availability of the use of the Earth science program and specifically
the satellite technology as we try to address, not just in California’s
case, but throughout the country, availability of water as we try to
forecast  for  crop  productions  and  crop—annual  crop  yields  as  we
try to attempt to ensure that we are doing our best to manage our
water resources.

Would you care to comment?
Dr. WILLIAMSON. Yes, I will. Thank you.
You  know,  a  famous  poet  once  wrote  that  there  is  water,  water
everywhere,  but  not  a  drop  to  drink.  And  it  usually  is  thought  in
that  case,  specific  case,  it  applied  to  the  ocean.  But  we  are  begin-
ning  to  face  that  in  critical  areas  around  the  world  and  certainly

through  the  United—throughout  the  United  States.  And  in  your
State of California, you have faced, over the years, a lot of concerns
about that issue. And I appreciate that.

One  of  the  tremendous  advantages  of  satellite  technology,  and
supported  by  adequate  research,  is  the  ability  for  satellites  to  see
areas together in a so-called synoptic view, all together at one time.
And that ability to gauge water resources by observing the quality
of  water  in  large  freshwater  areas  and  observing  the  sources  of
water  in—especially  in  the  State  of  California.  A  lot  of  your  water
is  supplied  by  the  snow  in  the  wintertime  in  the  northern  parts  of
California and the states somewhat east of you. And in fact, we can
begin  to  understand  how  much  water  is  available  by  looking  at
snow cover and snow depth and so forth, and satellite imagery, sat-
ellite  measurements  of  all  kinds  are  very  useful  in  that  endeavor.
So there are a number of different applications that are possible,
but  we  need  better  science  to  support  those  observations,  and  I
know  that  NASA  has  a  program  to  look  at  those  kinds  of  things
and  that  certainly  needs  to  be  continued.  GPM  is  a  good  example
of a system that would assist in that effort.

Mr. COSTA. Dr. Killeen.
Dr. KILLEEN. May I comment, too?
Mr. COSTA. Sure.
Dr.  KILLEEN.  The  problem  with  a  regional  access  to  water  is  a
wonderful  case  study  of  this  need  for  Earth  system  science  to
produce decision tools to help predict and manage resources region-
ally.  And  in  my  testimony,  I  hope—I  was  trying  to  make  the  case
that we are on the threshold of being able to do that with regional
fidelity  that  is  unprecedented,  and  the  U.S.  is  in  the  leadership  in
this  arena.  If  you  think  about  water  in  California,  it  is  dependent
on snow. It is dependent on precipitation. It relates to El Nin˜ o and
La Nin˜ a cycles that Mr. Rohrabacher was talking about.

Mr.  COSTA.  We  used  to  think  that  droughts  lasted  five  to  seven
years.  Today,  by  new  studies  that  have  come  out,  it  is  estimated
historically  that  droughts  have  lasted  anywhere  from  50  to  70
years because of new science that has come forth.

Dr.  KILLEEN.  There  are  long-term  droughts  that  have  lasted
longer  than  that  in  the  continental  United  States  in  the  historical
record,  and  so  we  need  to  understand  the  factors,  the  harbingers
that will—would change materially the provision of water to states
like California. It means a regional decision support system, which
is  going  to  be  derived  from  satellite  data  sets,  data  resimulation
into numerical models, large computational models that have fidel-
ity and that are tested continued against reality to make sure that
they  work  and  they  are  real.  And  these  are  the  sort  of  important
scientific underpinnings for management of natural resources, such
as in your state.

Mr. COSTA. Thank you.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Thank you, Mr. Costa.
The gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee.

EFFECTS OF DECREASED EARTH SCIENCE FUNDING

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  very  much,  and  I
thank  the  Ranking  Member  for  I  think  what  is  a  very  important
hearing.  I  think,  as  I  look  at  the  panelists  whose  testimony  I  will

review,  and  I  thank  you  for  your  indulgence  of  the  several  meet-
ings,  and  even  meetings  in  the  anteroom  with  constituents.  But
Mr. Diaz, let me thank you very much for your service. And I think
I will focus more particularly on some of the others. And I will ask
a broad-based question.

Let  me  just  let  it  out  of  the  bag.  I  am  a  strong  supporter  of  the
human  space  flight  and  the  Shuttle.  I  come  from  Houston.  But  I
have  been  on  this  committee  now  for  going  on  10  years,  or  maybe
almost 10 years. I have never stepped away from the valued impor-
tance of Earth science. And it disheartens me to know that our gov-
ernment  is  in  the  horns  of  a  dilemma  in  borrowing  from  Peter  to
pay  Paul,  unnecessary,  from  my  perspective.  Now  it  seems  to  me
that  there  is  dynamic  research  going  on  in  the  private  sector,  aca-
demic  institutions.  So  I  am  going  to  be  asking  broad-based  ques-
tions. I want to know if that is the case. I want to know what value
it is to have a government entity actively engaged in Earth science,
you  know,  how  does  that—you  know,  we  have  always  heard  the
story  that  the  Internet  generated  out  of  DOD  and  look  where  we
are  today.  And  somebody  might  want  to—I  think  someone  is  smil-
ing  because  of  who  may  have  taken  credit  or  not.  But  the  point  is
that  we  know  that  it  was  a  government-based  energy  that  came
forth.

So  I  want  these  broad-based  questions  which  is,  you  know,  how
are we harmed if we diminish our efforts in Earth science. That is
the first one. That perilous route are we now taking by the govern-
ment’s  major  cuts  that  we  are  now  experiencing  and  suffering  in
the  Earth  science  area?  Mr.  Diaz  has  to  defend  a  budget  that  I
think  is  non-defendable.  And  then,  in  particular,  I  want  to  speak
about  what  Earth  science  NASA  has  been  able  to  do  and  that  is
dealing  with  the  NASA  Global  Precipitation  Management  satellite
and  the  fact  that  we  have  had  to  cancel  or  scale  back  most  Earth
science  missions,  this  satellite  is  to  be  coordinated  with  launches
of  related  satellites  by  other  nations,  was  first  scheduled  to  be
launched  in  2007,  currently  launching  in  2010,  and  would  be  con-
sidered on schedule. Obviously, it is not on schedule because of the
budget.

The other point that I wanted to be pointed about, I went to Sri
Lanka  right  after  the  tsunami  and  walked  the  streets,  heard  the
stories  of  our  government  officials,  meaning  embassy,  heard  how
they  got  a  call,  how  they  heard  and  thought  that  someone  in  Ha-
waii  had  heard  something  but  had  no  ability  to  communicate  it,
and so it was an enormous tragedy, and to understand that NASA
has  the  capacity,  potentially,  to  detect  that  kind  of,  forgive  me  for
being a non-scientist, that kind of disturbance, that kind of disrup-
tion, that kind of notice that might have been given to those ocean-
based persons, and they could have had a greater saving of life.

So  there  is  Dr.  Moore,  Dr.  Killeen,  I  believe,  Dr.  Solomon,  Dr.
McNutt,  Dr.  Williamson,  and  is  there—is  that,  Dr.  Williamson,
going that way. Would you kindly—my light is still green, but I am
going  to  yield  to  you.  If  you  could  just  quickly  go  down  the  line
with those bullet points: the perilous route that we are taking, how
we  are  suffering  with  not  doing  this  Earth  science  at  the  pace  I
think we should.

Thank you, gentlemen and lady.

Dr.  MOORE.  Yeah,  I  think  these  cuts  are  significant,  and  there-
fore,  they  are  damaging.  You  could  not  have  significant  cuts  and
not have damage. An analogy that I have used earlier I would like
to return to. The United States government helps ensure the med-
ical care for this country through the National Institute of Health.
The  NIH  funds  fundamental  research  in  medicine  throughout  the
country,  both  at  universities  and  in  the  private  sector  and  in  na-
tional  labs.  NASA  plays,  in  a  unique  way,  that  same  role.  The
uniqueness is in the Earth—the ability to have the Earth observing
from  satellites.  And  so  when  we  begin  to  cut  into  that  research
base, we do damage.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Dr. Killeen.
Dr. KILLEEN. I would say that——
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  And  now  we  are  on  the  beige  light.  The  next
light is red, so we—and it is facing me, not you, but—so that is——
Dr.  KILLEEN.  I  think  the  Nation  does  stand  to  be  damaged  with
a  reduction  in—major  reduction  in  support  in  the  Earth  sciences
and  the  NASA  contributions  there.  You  asked  how  will  we  be
harmed  if  this—it  is  hard  to  be  precise  in  quantitative  terms,  but
we  are  a  knowledge-based  society,  and  we  will  be  reducing  the
amount  of  knowledge  we  will  have  in  the  future  to  support  deci-
sion-making. If you only think about the ozone hole and what that
meant  to  us  and  the  fact  that  NASA,  in  fact,  was  the  agency  that
allowed—it  was  provided  the  smoking  gun  that  gave  us  the  rela-
tionship  between  chlorine—man-produced  compounds  and  loss  of
ozone, and we were able to understand that problem and then react
to  it  with  international  protocols.  One  gets  a  sense  that  this  is  an
important  capability  that  we  need  to  sort  of  maintain  for  our  com-
munity.

I  am  most  concerned  about  the  pace  of  change.  Rapid  change  in
an  enterprise  like  this  can  cause  irrevocable  damage,  not  only  to
the building systems but also to the human capital and infrastruc-
ture for Earth science research.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Dr. McNutt? Oh, Dr. Solomon.
Dr.  SOLOMON.  Let  me  give  a  quick  answer  on  top  of  Dr.  Killeen,

and then Dr. McNutt can respond.

I  think  the  danger  in  not  carrying  forward  as  ambitious  and
thoughtful a program in Earth science as we can afford is two-fold.
One  is  knowledge,  as  others  have  said.  And  we  have  heard  exam-
ples  all  morning  and  into  the  afternoon  where  space  gives  us  an
opportunity to track hurricanes based—you saw firsthand the trag-
ic  consequences  of  a  tsunami  where  having  in  place  more  sensors
and the capability to convey warnings would have saved lives. The
same  is  true  with  volcanic  eruptions.  The  same  may  be  true  some
day  with  earthquakes  themselves.  So  that  knowledge  is  an  oppor-
tunity  cost  that  is  very  hard  to  gauge.  But  the  more  we  have,  the
better  we  can  deal  with  the  inevitable  changes  to  our—to  Earth.
We  are  not  going  to  stop  tsunamis,  and  we  are  not  going  to  stop
volcanoes from erupting, but to know that they are going to happen
and  to  have  warning  systems  in  real  time  can  make  a  real  dif-
ference.

The other loss that we could sustain if we cut back, and any pro-
gram  as  ambitious  as  Earth  science  and  space  or  human  space

flight, which is something that you follow, is the loss of interest of
the  next  generation.  I  think  these  programs  are  enormously  ap-
pealing, and the young people who are choosing what careers to go
into, they are very smart, and they can see——

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Trends.
Dr.  SOLOMON.—trends.  They  can  see  where  there  is  going  to  be
interesting things to do 10 or 20 years from now and where things
are shutting down.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  I  think  that  is  the  greatest  devastation.  You

are absolutely right.

Dr. McNutt.
Dr.  MCNUTT.  Yes.  I  wanted  to  briefly  comment  on  the  tsunami
and NASA’s role in it. Your reference was indeed right that the ad-
jacent  altimeter  satellite  was  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time,
that  it  detected  the  tsunami  wave.  That  was,  I  think,  a  chance  oc-
currence. One couldn’t count on that as a reliable warning system,
and  I  think  you  have  already  heard  testimony  of  systems  that
could be put in place.

I  will  mention,  however,  another  NASA  contribution,  and  that
was  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  tsunami,  NASA  satellites
were  able  to  record,  with  quite  high  fidelity,  the  damage  that  was
done  by  the  saltwater  that  affected  the  crops,  the  forests  in  the
area.  This  kind  of  information  was  important  for  assessing  what
the  economic  damage  would  be  and  where  help  most  needed  to  go
in order to bring relief to the affected populations. So I don’t think
NASA can be blamed for lack of a warning system, but I think they
should get some credit for the relief efforts.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  I  was  not  intending  to  blame.  I  was  saying
that enhancing what they had could, in fact, have put us in a bet-
ter position that Earth science is valuable.

Dr. Williamson, thank you.
Dr. WILLIAMSON. Yeah, well, I—as you have noticed from my tes-
timony, I tend to focus on the more practical aspects of whether the
outcomes of research and so forth. And it is certainly true that our
store  of  previous  research  and  knowledge  that  we  have  built  up
over  that  period  has  contributed  tremendously,  not  only  to  our
quality  of  life,  but  directly  to  the  economy.  And  I  notice  that  we
have suffered a—somewhat of a reversal in the economic growth in
the last quarter over the previous quarter.

One  of  the  things  that  needs  to  be  thought  through  in  these  ef-
forts  is  how  the  Earth  science  program  actually  contributes  to  the
economy. And I think it is a substantial contribution and certainly
NASA’s research, starting at the beginning, basically, it is basic re-
search  that  provides  the  foundation  for  these  wonderful  applica-
tions  that  we  all  benefit  from  really  needs  to  be  continued  and  at
a  reasonable  important—you  know,  pace,  if  you  will,  and  amount.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  thank  you  very
much, one, for your indulgence. If I might just ask unanimous con-
sent to have my statement, my full statement placed in the record
and  just  place  on  the  record  the  fact  that  this  is  a  very  important
hearing, particularly for those of us who are advocates of space ex-
ploration,  and  to  say  that  we  are  not  advocates  of  borrowing  from
Peter  to  pay  Paul  or  advocates  from  taking  from  one  program  or
another.

I happen to be a strong supporter of the International Space Sta-
tion,  and  I  think  there  is  a  wonderful  partnership,  potential  part-
nership between Earth science research and the Space Station. The
most devastating aspect of the testimony of all of the distinguished
gentlemen, including Mr. Diaz, who I thank for his service, is that
we are killing—to use a very strong and harsh term, we are killing
the spirit of the future scientists of America, and I think we would
do  a  disservice  to  do  that.  I  hope  we  can  find  a  way  in  this  bipar-
tisan Committee to restore some of the funds for Earth science.

I thank the gentleman very much.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Without objection.
Mr.  Diaz,  Dr.  Moore,  Dr.  Killeen,  Dr.  Solomon,  Dr.  McNutt,  Dr.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. You  stated  at  the  hearing  that  ‘‘We  are  in  conversation  with  NOAA  very  fre-
quently,  and  we  do  have  agreements  in  place  for  many  of  the  elements.. . .  [I]f
NOAA  were  sitting  here  today,  they  would  recognize. . .the  things  that  we  are
talking  about  transferring  or  the  things  we  are  talking  about  doing  jointly.’’
Please  provide  any  Memorandum  of  Understanding  or  other  document  relating
to NASA working jointly with NOAA, or transferring projects or project elements
to NOAA.

A1. The  NASA–NOAA  partnership  is  governed  by  the  NASA–NOAA  Basic  Agree-
ment, with annexes to address specific areas. The two agencies are currently work-
ing  on  an  annex  to  cover  research  and  operations  transitions  that  are  now  under
study.  NASA  and  NOAA  also  have  an  agreement  with  CNES  and  EUMETSAT  on
an  operational  ocean  topography  mission.  Copies  of  these  agreements  are  attached.
Q2. You also said at the hearing, ‘‘What we don’t have in place is an overall strategy
that is articulated that does what I have mentioned.’’ Are there any plans to ar-
ticulate  such  a  strategy?  Who  would  have  to  approve  such  a  strategy  at  NASA,
NOAA and the White House?

A2. OSTP  has  provided  specific  guidance  on  the  incorporation  of  Landsat-type  in-
struments  into  the  NPOESS  program  as  the  means  to  secure  long-term  continuity
of  land  cover  remote  sensing.  More  broadly,  the  Executive  Branch  has  developed
and  approved  a  strategic  plan  for  an  Integrated  Earth  Observation  System  as  the
U.S. contribution to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems. This plan pri-
marily  covers  the  operational  components  of  a  national  observing  system.  The  re-
search components are coordinated through various interagency programs, including
the  Climate  Change  Science  Program.  Both  operational  and  research  observation
plans are coordinated through the U.S. Group on Earth Observation (USGEO) of the
Committee  on  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  of  the  National  Science  and
Technology  Council.  The  USGEO  is  co-chaired  by  officials  from  OSTP,  NASA,  and
NOAA.  In  addition,  senior  officials  from  both  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate
and NOAA are Principals of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources
and must sign off on CENR plans.
Q3. The first recommendation of the Academy panel is that the Global Precipitation
Mission (GPM) be launched without delay. It is unclear whether GPM is funded
at  an  adequate  level  in  the  FY06  budget  proposal  to  be  able  to  achieve  this
launch  schedule.  The  FY  2005  budget  request  reduced  the  funding  for  GPM  to
allow for a 2012 launch date. The FY 2006 budget maintains this reduced fund-
ing level, despite stating that GPM is now scheduled to launch in 2010. Is GPM
funded  at  the  level  to  allow  for  a  2010  launch?  How  much  funding  must  GPM
have to ensure that the mission launches in 2010?

A3. GPM is a mission in formulation, and therefore does not have a fixed life cycle
cost.  In  FY  2006,  NASA  has  requested  $24  million  to  support  a  2010  launch  date.
Q4. As  part  of  the  procurement  for  the  GPM  Microwave  Imager  (GMI),  does  NASA
plan to include two high-frequency channels (specifically, 166 and 183 GHz) for
the instrument? If not, why not?

A4. The  two  high-frequency  channels  are  options,  as  is  a  second  GMI  unit,  in  the
current contract with Ball Aerospace Technologies Corporation to develop and build
the  GPM  Microwave  Imager  (GMI).  The  decision  on  exercising  the  high  frequency
option  will  be  made  based  on  scientific  merit  and  cost  during  the  next  several
months.
Q5. In  your  testimony,  you  mentioned  that  NASA  is  participating  in  a  Joint  Re-
search to Operations Working Group with NOAA. What is NASA’s funding level
for  this  working  group?  Please  describe  the  results  of  the  interactions  between
NASA and NOAA within this working group so far.

A5. The  R&O  Transition  Plan  being  formulated  by  the  JWG  includes  a  systematic
approach  to  develop  Capability  Implementation  Plans  for  each  research  capability
that  is  identified  for  transition  to  operations.  The  budget  associated  with
transitioning  the  capability  will  be  included  in  the  Capability  Implementation  Plan
for senior management review. The agencies will determine how transition cost will

be allocated, based on the approved version of the Capability Implementation Plan.
The  funding  for  the  working  group  so  far  has  been  to  support  the  personnel  in  the
working  group.  There  are  20  active  members  of  the  working  group  (10  from  NOAA
and  10  from  NASA).  Even  though  the  civil  servant  support  has  been  deemed  part
of  the  normal  course  of  the  job,  the  value  of  the  civil  servant  time  and  contractor
support to this effort is valued at ∼$400 thousand.

An  ad  hoc  Joint  Working  Group  (JWG)  was  organized  and  has  been  holding  reg-
ular  bi-weekly  meetings  since  October  2004.  Dr.  Colleen  Hartman  (NOAA)  and  Dr.
Mary  Cleave  (NASA)  are  the  senior  managers  responsible  for  oversight  of  the  ad
hoc JWG. Gary Davis (NOAA) and Ron Birk (NASA) are the co-leads for the ad hoc
JWG.

The  following  are  results  for  the  NASA  and  NOAA  interactions  through  the  ad

hoc Joint Working Group to date:

• Formulated  and  documented  an  organizational  and  performance  framework
for  this  bilateral  R&O  activity,  including  agency  and  user  community  roles.
• Formulating,  documenting,  and  coordinating  joint  agency  concurrence  to  a
plan for implementing the R&O transition process that includes seeking inde-
pendent evaluation and reviews of the plan.
• Defining,  documenting,  and  facilitating  the  process  for  development  and  ap-
proval  of  Capability  Implementation  Plans  (CIP)  for  transition  or  use  of  spe-
cific research and operational capabilities.
• Coordinating  identification  of  candidate  transition  capabilities  by  integrating

tion Plans (CIP).

The NASA Applied Sciences Program is focused on extending the results of Earth
science  research  to  serve  in  operational  systems  through  partnerships  with  federal
agencies and national organizations and is supporting the JWG.
Q6. In  your  testimony  you  mentioned  that  one  way  NASA  and  NOAA  have  worked
together was funding the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 2003 report, Sat-
ellite  Observations  of  the  Earth’s  Environment,  Accelerating  the  Transition
from  Research  to  Operations.  One  of  the  major  recommendations  from  that  re-
port is that ‘‘a strong and effective Interagency Transition Office for the planning
and  coordination  of  activities  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Adminis-
tration  (NASA)  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
(NOAA) in support of transitioning research to operations should be established
by  and  should  report  to  the  highest  levels  of  NASA  and  NOAA.’’  Does  NASA
support establishing and Interagency Transition Office as described in the NAS
report? If so, what is NASA doing to establish the Office? If not, why not?

A6. NASA and NOAA are actively engaged in establishing the Joint Working Group
on  Transition  Research  and  Operations  (R&O).  This  joint  working  group  includes
senior  management  from  both  agencies  and  a  structured  approach  to  involve  key
personnel  for  each  of  the  areas  for  transition.  The  approach  is  to  establish  agree-
ment on specific capabilities to be transitioned and to assign teams with representa-
tives  from  NASA  and  NOAA  to  participate  in  developing  the  Capability  Implemen-
tation Plans.

Deliberations  on  the  recommendations  from  the  NAS  2003  report  to  establish  an
Interagency  Transition  Office  led  to  the  development  of  the  Joint  Working  Group
on  Transition  of  Research  and  Operations.  The  JWG  is  formulating  a  Transition
Plan to systematically:

a. Identify  the  candidate  capabilities  for  transition  (including  community  par-

ticipation).

b. Establish teams with the appropriate knowledge to develop Capability Tran-

sition Implementation Plans.

c. Formulate  the  detailed  Capability  Transition  Implementation  Plans  with  in-
formation  on  schedule,  budget,  resource  requirements,  and  benefits  to  the
Nation.

d. Senior  review  of  the  Capability  Transition  Implementation  Plans  for  subse-

quent decisions on budget and resource allocations.

94

This approach optimizes the capacity of involving the appropriate representatives

for the functions of:

a. Establishing and evolving the processes for transitions.
b. Identifying the candidate capabilities for transition.
c. Developing the capability transition implementation plans.
d. Reviewing the capability implementation plans.
e. Identifying and allocating budgets and resources to implementation the capa-

bility transitions.

Q7. What  is  the  status  of  the  NASA  Earth  Science  and  Applications  from  Space

Strategic Roadmap and what are the main conclusions of their work so far?

A7. The NASA Earth Science and Applications from Space Strategic Roadmap Com-
mittee  completed  its  work  with  the  submission  of  its  report  to  NASA  on  May  22,
2005. The NRC has separate congressional direction to look at NASA science issues,
including  the  six  science  roadmaps.  NASA  has  since  provided  to  the  NRC  the
science  roadmaps  received  on  May  22.  In  June,  members  from  each  of  the  six
science committees will brief the committee results to the NRC. The NRC will plan
to  provide  a  report  or  other  input  on  the  science  roadmaps  to  NASA  by  August  1,
2005.

The  concepts  and  recommendations  identified  by  the  Earth  Science  and  Applica-
tions from Space Strategic Roadmap Committee are advice to NASA and are subject
to  review  by  the  NRC.  The  following  are  some  of  the  concepts  put  forward  by  the
Roadmap Committee:

1. In  addition  to  scientific  objectives  that  motivate  specific  missions  and  mod-
eling, the committee identified integration objectives that motivate the syner-
gistic networking of systems.

2. The  committee  has  identified  a  metric,  the  measurement  maturity  index,  to
assist in the planning and management of investigations, assess their poten-
tial  transition  to  operations,  and  as  an  aggregate  measure  of  the  balance  of
investments  in  a  research  area.  While  needing  more  development,  the  com-
mittee believes this could be developed into a useful tool for planning future
investigations.

3. The  committee  identified  a  preliminary  mission  timeline,  along  with  an  ap-
proach (called ‘‘awareness clusters’’) to organizing and building over time the
integrated capacity to observe and model the Earth system.

The near-term recommendations of the Committee include:

1. Complete the current, approved NASA program in a timely fashion.
2. Begin  advanced  planning  for  several  near-future  missions  identified  in  the

committee’s timeline.

3. Begin  advanced  planning  for  the  first  ‘‘awareness  cluster,’’  including  the
technologies,  missions,  models,  networks,  and  educational  and  international
cooperation opportunities that support the science focus of the cluster.

4. Start at least one new mission in FY 2007 or FY 2008 and the others as soon

as possible after that.

Q8. The National Academy of Sciences interim report stated: ‘‘The committee is con-
cerned  that  a  significant  reallocation  of  resources  for  the  research  and  analysis
(R&A)  programs  that  sustain  the  interpretation  of  Earth  science  data  has  oc-
curred  either  as  a  result  of  the  removal  of  the  ‘firewall’  that  previously  existed
between flight and science programs or as an unintended consequence of NASA’s
shift  to  full-cost  accounting.’’  Please  describe  the  extent  to  which  NASA  has  re-
allocated  funding  for  the  Earth  Science  R&A  programs,  and  explain  why  this
has occurred.

A8. In  recent  years,  NASA’s  research  budget  has  been  largely  stable.  The  research
and  analysis  (R&A)  program,  one  of  about  60  projects  within  the  Earth-Sun  Re-
search  Program,  has  been  particularly  stable,  with  minimal  year-to-year  fluctua-
tions.  There  has  been  only  one  significant  modification  to  this  program  in  recent
years.  The  transition  from  ‘‘business-as-usual’’  to  ‘‘full  cost  accounting’’  in  FY  2004
led to an increase of approximately 20 percent in the R&A budget over the FY 2003
budget, but the imprecision associated with this transition led to an increase in re-
quirements  for  center-related  funding  that  was  approximately  50  percent  greater
than  the  increase  in  funds,  leading  to  an  effective  reduction  in  purchasing  power
of  the  R&A  program  of  the  order  of  15  percent.  The  shortfall  in  FY  2004  impacted
contractors at the NASA centers and the broader research community. In FY 2005,

95

the  R&A  program  was  adjusted  to  accommodate  these  full  cost  transitions  and  per
the mid-year operating plan, is $10 million higher than the final FY 2004 operating
plan.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  specific  Earth  Science-related  responsibilities  is  NASA  transferring  or

planning to transfer to NOAA?
a. What are the timetables for the transfers?
b. What  are  the  estimated  budgetary  impacts  of  the  responsibilities  transferred?
A1a,b. NASA has long served as the research, technology development, and satellite
development source for the Nation’s civil space-based remote sensing capability and
will continue to perform in this capacity. During the past several years, the NASA–
NOAA  partnership  has  evolved  across  a  broad  front  to  meet  the  Nation’s  need  for
affordable operational and research observations. (1) techniques; (2) technologies; (3)
measurement  responsibilities;  and  (4)  remote  sensing  instruments  and  platforms.
NASA’s  baseline  budget  reflects  our  expectation  that  the  ongoing  partnership  with
NOAA  will  continue  to  evolve.  However,  the  budgetary  impacts  associated  with  the
transfer  of  responsibilities  in  not  known  at  this  time.  Each  of  these  areas  involves
joint  NASA  and  NOAA  efforts  that  lead  to  the  transfer  of  innovative  capabilities,
as summarized below:
Techniques—The focus in this area is on the utilization of remote sensing data to
improve  the  models  that  NASA  and  NOAA  use  to  create  weather  and  climate  fore-
casts. NASA, NOAA and USAF have established the Joint Center for Satellite Data
Assimilation  as  a  means  to  accelerate  the  use  of  research  data  to  improve  oper-
ational weather and climate forecasting. NASA has also been working with NOAA’s
National Hurricane Center to improve hurricane track forecasting via new model al-
gorithms and data.
Technologies—New technologies will focus on the improvement of NOAA’s weather
forecasting  capability  based  on  science  and  technology  through  new  spacecraft  and
modeling.  The  next  generation  weather  satellites  will  use  satellite  spacecraft  that
are  based  on  those  developed  by  NASA  and  its  prime  contractor  for  the  EOS  Aqua
and Aura missions.
Instruments and Platforms—The development of advanced instruments and plat-
forms  by  NASA  in  a  research  context  that  can  be  used  in  NOAA’s  next  generation
of operational environmental satellites. The NPOESS VIIRS and ATMS sensors, for
example,  continue  the  imaging  and  sounding  observations  by  the  NASA  EOS
MODIS and AIRS sensors, respectively.
Measurements—New  instruments  prepare  the  way  for  transition  of  measurement
responsibilities.  This  includes  plans,  underway  since  the  late  1990s,  to  continue  se-
lected climate measurements begun by NASA’s Earth Observing System via transfer
of  instrument  technologies  and  measurement  responsibilities  begun  by  EOS  Terra
and  Aqua  to  the  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  Sys-
tem  (NPOESS).  The  first  fruit  of  this  effort  will  be  the  NPOESS  Preparatory
Project,  a  satellite  now  in  development  jointly  by  NASA  and  the  NPOESS  Inte-
grated  Program  Office.  This  mission  will  carry  both  the  VIIRS  and  ATMS  instru-
ments  as  well  as  others.  Based  on  the  strategy  of  assuming  that  a  number  of  the
critical  measurements  made  by  Terra  and  Aqua  would  be  done  through  NPOESS,
NASA was able to reduce the planned budget for systematic Earth science measure-
ments.

NASA may propose innovative next generation missions to begin during this time
frame,  in  keeping  with  the  general  strategy  of  transitioning  mature  measurement
responsibilities  so  that  operational  systems  can  benefit  and  NASA  can  move  on  to
the  next  frontier.  In  parallel,  NASA,  NOAA  and  their  European  counterparts  have
been  working  over  the  last  three  years  on  a  plan  to  transition  ocean  surface  altim-
etry measurements begun by the NASA/CNES TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason missions
to  a  future  operational  system  using  the  Ocean  Surface  Topography  Mission  now
under  development  as  a  ‘‘bridge.’’  Not  all  measurements  begun  by  EOS  are  slated
for transition to NPOESS, but the significant ones that are, including the basic im-
aging  and  sounding  done  by  Terra  and  Aqua,  help  in  enabling  the  reduced  budget
planned  for  Earth  science  to  still  accommodate  a  mix  of  continued  long-term  meas-
urements, and first implementation of new types of global measurements, for exam-
ple through the Earth System Science Pathfinder line of competed missions and the
Global Precipitation Mission.

Opportunities flow in the other direction as well, for example in the area of flight
of NASA research instruments on NOAA spacecraft. Currently, attention is focused
on  future  geostationary  missions.  NASA  continues  to  build  and  launch  Geo-
stationary  Operational  Environmental  Satellites  for  NOAA,  with  the  recent  launch

of  GOES–N  on  May  20,  2005.  The  next  generation  series  will  begin  with  GOES–
R.  NASA  and  NOAA  are  discussing  a  strategy  to  reserve  capacity  on  this  series  of
satellites for demonstration of advanced instruments of importance to both agencies.

Major measurement transitions in work:

Aqua to NPOESS (∼2010) via NPP (∼2006)
(∼2010) via NPP (∼2006)
Land Imager (∼2010)

• Climate quality atmosphere and biosphere measurements begun by Terra and
• Upper  atmosphere  ozone  measurements  from  TOMS  &  Aura  to  NPOESS
• Land  cover  change  measurements  from  Landsat  7  to  NPOESS  Operational
• Ocean  surface  topography  from  TOPEX/Poseidon  and  Jason  to  an  NOAA/
EUMETSAT  operational  system  via  NASA/CNES  development  and  NOAA/
EUMETSAT operation of the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (2008)
• Next generation geostationary satellites beginning with GOES–R (∼2012)

Q2. What  do  you  consider  the  most  promising  future  benefits  that  the  Nation  might
gain  from  continued  investments  in  Earth  Science  research?  What  will  be  the
negative  impacts  on  society  if  NASA’s  commitment  to  Earth  Science  research
and applications is diminished in the coming years?

A2. NASA’s  Earth  Science  programs  are  our  nation’s  primary  innovators  in  pro-
viding  new  information  about  the  global  Earth  system  using  the  unique  vantage
point  of  space.  NASA’s  perspective  is  global,  and  emphasizes  the  ‘‘Earth  system
view’’  that  encourages  understanding  of  the  interconnections  between  various  com-
ponents  of  the  Earth  system  (atmosphere,  oceans,  biosphere,  cryosphere,  and
lithosphere). NASA’s commitment to Earth science research and application directly
enables  advanced  understanding  of  the  current  interactions  and  future  evolution  of
the  Earth  system,  as  well  as  allows  NASA  to  support  the  U.S.  Climate  Change
Science Program (CCSP).

The  space-based  missions  carried  out  by  NASA  provide  information  about  the
global distribution of Earth system parameters never before available on the spatial
and temporal scales that NASA can provide. Recent examples include ice sheet and
sea ice changes in polar regions (from ICESat), more accurate measurements of the
Earth’s  gravitational  field  and  their  analysis  to  determine  information  about  water
stored  underneath  the  Earth’s  surface  (from  GRACE),  distribution  and  nature  of
aerosol particles that affect climate, precipitation, and air quality (from Terra), and
distribution  of  precipitation  over  the  ocean  in  the  tropics  and  subtropics  (from
TRAM).  Future  space  systems  will  provide  significant  enhancements  in  our  knowl-
edge  of  the  global  three-dimensional  distribution  of  clouds  and  aerosols,  and  then
high-resolution information about the global distribution of carbon dioxide (suitable
for inferring information about global sources and sinks), and ocean salinity.

NASA  contributes  to  the  record  of  long-term  satellite  measurements  needed  to
help evaluate change in the Earth system and help scientists separate between nat-
ural  and  human-induced  changes.  Examples  include  studies  of  ozone  distributions
(from  the  TOMS  series),  solar  irradiance  (most  recently  from  UARS,  ACRIMSAT,
and  SORCE),  of  ocean  surface  topography  (from  Topex/Poseidon  and  Jason),  and  of
the  Earth’s  overall  radiation  budget  (most  recently  from  the  CERES  instruments
aboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft). The long-term need for precise and accurate
calibration  is  not  something  that  has  been  available  from  operational  platforms  in
the  past.  NASA’s  efforts  also  include  a  significant  focus  on  modeling  and  data  as-
similation  to  be  sure  that  new  data  can  be  understood  and  used  to  test  hypotheses
of our current understanding of the Earth system’s behavior and to improve our ca-
pability to predict it in the future.

NASA strives to facilitate the use of its data in supporting policy development and
resource  management  through  its  applied  science  program,  partnering  with  other
federal  agencies  to  accelerate  the  process  by  which  space-based  data  can  be  used
to serve society (e.g., improve weather and climate forecasting and prediction of nat-
ural  hazards).  NASA’s  technology  program  constitutes  an  investment  in  future
Earth  science,  developing  the  observational  tools  and  techniques  that  will  enable
new  views  of  the  Earth  in  the  future,  making  possible  measurements  not  currently
possible  today  as  we  look  to  push  back  the  frontiers  in  Earth  remote  sensing  (e.g.,
more frequent temporal sampling, improved determination of the vertical dimension
in  the  measurement  of  Earth  system  parameters).  A  vigorous  basic  research  pro-
gram underlies all of the above so that as new information is gained, scientists can
innovatively  incorporate  new  knowledge  into  their  studies,  develop  and  test
hypotheses,  improve  models,  and  develop  newer  techniques  that  will  enable  new
knowledge in the future.

Q3a. Two years ago, the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council rec-
ommended the establishment of an Interagency Transition Office to manage the
issues  involved  in  transitioning  the  capabilities  developed  in  research  instru-
ments  to  the  operational  systems  that  support  weather  monitoring  and  fore-
casting.
Have  NASA  and  NOAA  taken  any  steps  to  establish  such  an  organization?  If
not, why not?

A3a. NASA  and  NOAA  are  actively  engaged  in  establishing  the  Joint  Working
Group  on  Transition  Research  and  Operations  (R&O).  This  joint  working  group  in-
cludes senior management from both agencies and a structured approach to involve
key  personnel  for  each  of  the  areas  for  transition.  The  approach  is  to  establish
agreement  on  specific  capabilities  to  be  transitioned  and  to  assign  teams  with  rep-
resentatives  from  NASA  and  NOAA  to  participate  in  developing  the  Capability  Im-
plementation Plans.
Q3b. If  so,  when  was  the  organization  established  who  heads  it,  and  what  is  its

charter?

A3b. An  ad  hoc  Joint  Working  Group  (JWG)  was  organized  and  has  been  holding
regular  bi-weekly  meetings  since  October  2004.  Dr.  Colleen  Hartman  (NOAA)  and
Dr.  Mary  Cleave  (NASA)  are  the  senior  managers  responsible  for  oversight  of  the
ad  hoc  JWG.  Gary  Davis  (NOAA)  and  Ron  Birk  (NASA)  are  the  co-leads  for  the  ad
hoc JWG.

The roles and responsibilities include:

• NASA and NOAA designated representatives lead the JWG. The JWG devel-
ops,  implements,  and  facilitates  a  senior  level  collaboration  process.  This  col-
laboration process is used to coordinate, evaluate, identify, and transition ap-
propriate  NASA  research  results  (capabilities)  for  NOAA  operational  and  ap-
plied research use; and appropriate NOAA operational assets (capabilities) to
support NASA research.

• Designated NASA and NOAA senior representatives jointly provide oversight
of  and  accountability  for,  this  working  group.  These  representatives  are  re-
sponsible for coordination of performance measures and goals, and compliance
with  their  respective  agency  policies  and  processes  relevant  to  successful  im-
plementation and maintenance of a bilateral R&O process.

• An  initial  transition  plan  detailing  the  R&O  process,  including  an  initial  set
of  implementation  plans  for  transition  of  specific  research  result  capabilities,
will be submitted to senior NASA and NOAA leadership for approval by Sep-
tember 30, 2005.

Q3c. Does the organization determine how transition costs will be allocated between

the two agencies? If not, who does?

A3c. The R&O Transition Plan being formulated by the JWG includes a systematic
approach  to  develop  Capability  Implementation  Plans  for  each  research  capability
that  is  identified  for  transition  to  operations.  The  budget  associated  with
transitioning  the  capability  will  be  included  in  the  Capability  Implementation  Plan
for senior management review. The agencies will determine how transition costs will
be  allocated  based  on  the  approved  version  of  the  Capability  Implementation  Plan.
Q4. Based  on  correspondence  between  Admiral  Lautenbacher  and  then-NASA  Ad-
ministrator  O’Keefe,  it  appears  that  there  was  no  advance  coordination  between
NASA and NOAA when NASA decided to terminate the Tropical Rainfall Moni-
toring Mission last year.
a. Is that correct?
b. If so, why wasn’t there adequate advance coordination?

A4a,b. There has been considerable coordination between NASA and NOAA regard-
ing TRMM, dating back to 2001. NASA and NOAA personnel have discussed TRMM
re-entry  plans  in  a  number  of  forums,  including  workshops,  correspondence,  and
meetings.  In  April  and  July  2003,  NASA  sent  letters  to  the  two  registered  NOAA
TRMM real-time data users (John Paquette/NESDIS and Stephen Lord/NCEP) stat-
ing  NASA’s  expectation  that  TRMM’s  decommissioning  could  begin  as  early  as  the
first quarter of 2004. In July 2004, ten days prior to the mailing of the correspond-
ence  cited  by  Rep.  Gordon,  nine  senior  NOAA  staff  members  representing  a  broad
cross  section  of  NOAA  were  notified  via  e-mail  of  the  imminent  decommissioning.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. The  FY  2006  budget  request  has  combined  the  Earth  Systems  and  Sun-Earth
Connections  budgets.  Please  provide  a  detailed  crosswalk  between  the  FY  2005
budget  request  and  FY  2006  budget  request  and  its  five-year  runout  with  the
Earth Systems and Sun-Earth Connections budgets broken out separately.

A1. See attached budget crosswalk and five-year run-outs.
Q2. Due to a cut in funding, there are plans to end several extended missions in Oc-

tober of 2005, including Voyager.

Q2a. Will there be a new Senior Review to reconsider the planned terminations?
A2a. Yes,  decisions  on  scientific  priorities  will  be  made  once  NASA  receives  input
from both the Sun-Earth Connection and Earth System Science Senior Review Pan-
els. These panels, composed of external and independent senior researchers with rel-
evant  knowledge  and  experience,  meet  periodically  to  review  proposals  for  innova-
tive  research,  accomplished  with  existing  space  assets.  The  panels  assist  NASA  by
evaluating  the  scientific  merit  of  each  extended  mission  on  a  ‘‘science-per-dollar,’’
basis in terms of the expected returns from new science goals.
Q2b. If so, when will it take place?
A2b. The  Earth  System  Science  review  is  currently  in  progress  and  the  Sun-Earth
Connection review is expected to convene in the fall of 2005.
Q2c. Will  funding  for  these  missions  be  maintained  until  a  new  Senior  Review  is

completed? How much funding would be required?

A2c. NASA  will  permit  the  Sun-Earth  Connection  missions  to  operate  while  the
Senior  Review  process  provides  for  a  new  assessment  of  the  future  scientific  value
of  these  operating  missions.  This  is  expected  to  cost  approximately  $20.6  million  in
FY 2006. At the conclusion of the Panels’ deliberations, NASA will use their assess-
ments  and  findings  to  develop  Agency  decisions  regarding  the  continued  operation
of these missions.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael M. Honda
Q1. What  priority  is  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  as  NASA  pursues  the  Presi-

dent’s exploration initiative?

Q1a. How have the recent decisions to cancel, de-scope, or delay recent Earth observ-
ing missions or mission programs been made? In particular, please explain the
rationale  for  seeking  the  assistance  of  the  National  Academies  in  determining
what the highest priority areas should be and then making changes before the
results of that study are known?

A1a. NASA’s  Guiding  National  Objectives  specifically  identify  studying  the  Earth
system from space, and developing new space-based and related capabilities for this
purpose,  as  a  priority  for  the  Agency.  Not  only  are  NASA’s  activities  in  Earth
Science  are  essential  to  the  achievement  of  NASA’s  mission,  they  directly  support
three  Presidential  initiatives:  Climate  Change,  Global  Earth  Observation,  and  Col-
laborative Oceans Research.

In  all  of  NASA’s  science  disciplines,  decisions  often  must  be  taken  between
Decadal Surveys or triennial strategic plans, and are taken based on the best avail-
able data on science community priorities and prior strategic plans and surveys. As
such,  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  generally  chooses  to  stay  the  course  on  mis-
sions already in development, and if necessary, defer missions that were only in the
formulation stage, and cancel selected missions where an alternative source of data
could be identified.

By  applying  these  criteria  to  NASA’s  Earth  science  missions,  only  the  Glory  mis-
sion was descoped in the FY 2006 budget to an instrument-only build. The remain-
ing  Earth  science  missions  were  left  largely  unchanged,  reflecting  the  need  to  re-
spond  to  national  priorities  in  Earth  science  and  in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  the
results of the Decadal Survey would not be available until late 2006.
Q1b. What  role  is  full-cost  accounting  and  the  fact  that  it  was  not  accompanied  by
the  appropriate  reallocation  of  salary  and  other  infrastructure  money  to  sup-
port those scientists working on critical Earth Science projects playing in these
decisions?

A1b. Adoption of full cost accounting practices has neither affected the strategy for
pursuit  of  Earth  science  by  NASA  in  the  era  of  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,
nor the process of prioritization of research and missions in the Science Mission Di-
rectorate.  There  are  important  questions  to  address  in  this  arena,  and  this  is  the
subject  of  the  National  Research  Council  decadal  survey  for  Earth  science  now  un-
derway.  However,  these  questions  exist  quite  apart  from  the  topic  of  full  cost  ac-
counting.

Funds  previously  carried  separately  for  civil  servant  salaries  and  institutional
support  were  added  to  program  budgets  (including  Earth  science)  in  FY  2005  and
beyond.  Implementation  of  full  cost  accounting  and  management  posed  some  chal-
lenges  in  the  start-up  phase,  but  the  magnitude  of  these  problems  should  decrease
over  time  as  we  get  more  experience  in  working  within  this  new  environment.  The
inherent difficulty in making this significant transition led to some short-term tran-
sient  effects  and  some  near-term  challenges  in  FY  2005  that  affected  university  re-
searchers, civil servants, and contractors. We anticipate the process of soliciting, se-
lecting,  and  funding  science  proposals  from  the  community  (in  both  academia  and
NASA Centers) in the era of full cost accounting will be smoother in the coming fis-
cal year.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. Given the increasing vulnerability to extreme weather and climate variations as
seen  by  the  tsunami  and  the  various  hurricanes  that  hit  Florida,  what  initia-
tives,  if  any,  does  NASA  currently  have  to  explore  such  events?  NASA  has  been
a  major  sponsor  of  such  research  in  the  past;  what  initiatives  does  NASA  have
planned  for  the  future?  What  effect  will  budget  constraints  have  on  these
projects?

A1. Tsunami:  A  capable  tsunami  warning  system  must  be  both  reliable  and  cost
effective.  Tsunamis  are  caused  by  plate  boundary  earthquakes,  with  the  most  dev-
astating  tsunamis  occurring  within  a  few  hundred  miles  of  the  earthquake’s  epi-
center  due  to  both  the  larger  amplitude  of  the  tsunami  wave  and  the  lack  of  suffi-
cient  warning.  As  with  all  geohazards,  significant  savings  in  life  and  property  can
result  from  a  tsunami  warning  system  that  provides  the  information  necessary  for
risk assessment, warning, and recovery. NASA’s research and technology sponsored

primarily  by  the  Earth-Sun  Science  Division  of  the  Science  Mission  Directorate
seeks to address these fundamental requirements.

NASA  is  participating  within  the  IWGEO  and  with  other  federal  and  inter-
national  organizations  to  insure  the  effective  distribution  of  these  research  and  de-
velopment  results.  Imagery  from  four  NASA  spaceborne  instruments  shed  valuable
insights  into  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  that  resulted  from  the  magnitude  9  earth-
quake  southwest  of  Sumatra  on  December  26,  2004.  These  images  offered  several
unique  views  of  portions  of  the  affected  region.  The  data  helped  scientists  and  gov-
ernment agencies to assist with disaster recovery and will be used in mitigating the
effects of future natural hazards and increasing our understanding of how and why
tsunamis strike.
Tropical  Cyclones:  One  of  the  least  understood  issues  regarding  tropical  cyclone
(TC)  behavior  are  the  factors  that  influence  TC  genesis  and  rapid  intensification.
Hurricane  Charley  during  2004  is  an  example  of  a  TC  that  underwent  unpredicted
rapid intensification just hours before landfall in northern Florida.

NASA  is  leading  a  major  field  experiment  based  in  Costa  Rica  during  July  2005
called  the  Tropical  Cloud  Systems  and  Processes  (TCSP)  campaign.  The  aim  of
TCSP  is  to  investigate  atmospheric  and  oceanic  processes  governing  the  formation
and  intensification  of  hurricanes.  Costa  Rica  provides  the  ideal  mission  location  for
accessing a variety of TCs developing across the western Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico
and  Eastern  Pacific.  In  a  manner  similar  to  the  highly  successful  series  of  NASA
CAMEX  (Convection  and  Moisture  Experiments)  investigations,  the  NOAA  Hurri-
cane Research Division P3–Orion aircraft will fly joint missions with the NASA ER–
2  and  Aerosonde  aircraft  during  TCSP.  The  NASA  ER–2  is  a  unique,  high-flying
platform  with  a  sensitive  Doppler  radar,  passive  microwave  radiometer  and  atmos-
pheric profilers that serve as a ‘‘virtual satellite’’ and can thus be positioned to opti-
mally  sample  critical  regions  of  developing  tropical  cyclones.  One  important  goal  of
TCSP  is  to  improve  the  numerical  representation  of  hurricanes  using  the  specially
collected aircraft and satellite observations. For instance, TCSP scientists will work
closely  with  Florida  State  University  (FSU)  scientists  to  identify  data  sets  to  opti-
mize  the  highly  successful  FSU  Super  ensemble  hurricane  forecast  prediction  tool.
It  is  anticipated  that  the  TCSP  mission  will  answer  many  key  questions  per-
taining to the genesis of intense tropical vortices, in addition to raising many other
questions.  For  instance,  NASA  scientists  have  a  keen  interest  in  understanding
whether a core set of processes is unique to tropical cyclogenesis and intensification
anywhere  around  the  globe,  irrespective  of  geographic  location.  TCSP  will  address
many of the issues associated with TC genesis in close proximity to a central moun-
tain chain (the Central American cordillera) and the fate of African Easterly Waves
as  they  interact  with  this  terrain.  However,  the  African  Monsoon  Meteorology  Ex-
periment  (AMMA),  slated  for  the  eastern  Atlantic  in  summer  2006,  provides  a  po-
tential  opportunity  to  investigate  many  of  the  TCSP  hypotheses  in  a  different  geo-
graphical  setting.  For  instance,  what  is  the  influence  of  the  Saharan  Air  Layer  on
tropical  cyclogenesis?  Direct  NASA  participation  with  one  or  more  ground-based
Doppler radars and possibly a high altitude research aircraft stationed downstream
of  the  African  continent  during  AMMA  will  be  ideally  suited  to  better  understand
why  some  tropical  disturbances  develop  into  Atlantic  hurricanes,  while  others  do
not.  Historically,  the  most  destructive  hurricanes  that  make  landfall  on  U.S.  soil
originate from Africa during the late summer-early fall.

In addition, NASA has hurricane modeling research in the areas of advanced com-
putational modeling coupled with the space borne observations. A major experiment,
in  collaboration  with  NOAA,  which  combines  advanced  weather  prediction  model,
satellite  observations,  and  powerful  computing  platform,  is  currently  underway  for
the 2005 hurricane season.
Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM): TRMM was originally designed to be
a  three-year  scientific  research  mission.  It  is  now  in  its  eighth  year  of  operation,
having  completed  all  of  its  original  scientific  research  objectives  and  more.  NASA
and  the  Japan  Aerospace  Exploration  Agency  (JAXA)  will  continue  their  close  col-
laboration  beyond  TRMM  through  establishment  of  a  new  advanced  capability  for
the  measurement  of  precipitation  globally  with  the  Global  Precipitation  Measure-
ment mission (GPM). This mission will be a critical component of the International
Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems  and  will  significantly  improve  upon  the
temporal and spatial resolution provided by TRMM.

The  GPM  mission’s  Core  Satellite  is  planned  to  carry  advanced  dual-frequency
radar  that  will  provide  rain  measurements  exceeding  the  capabilities  of  TRMM.  In
addition,  GPM  will  use  an  international  constellation  of  satellites  to  measure  pre-
cipitation  globally  and  much  more  frequently  (approximately  every  three  hours)
than  TRMM.  In  addition  to  Japan,  Europe,  Canada,  France,  India,  South  Korea,

Taiwan,  Brazil,  and  others  have  expressed  and  interest  in  participating  in  GPM.  A
science team is currently in place to study the impact of precipitation variability on
specific processes within the atmospheric and/or surface water cycles, water budgets
and  their  closure.  The  precipitation  science  team  is  also  interested  in  studying  the
rate  of  water  cycling  through  the  atmosphere  and  surface,  and  the  relationships  of
linked precipitation-water cycle processes on weather and climate through both forc-
ing  and  feedback.  The  range  of  investigations,  in  addition  to  modeling  and  data
analysis,  includes  algorithm  improvements,  validation,  applications,  and  education/
outreach efforts. GPM is currently targeted for launch in late 2010.
Climate  Variability:  A  subtle  impact  of  extreme  weather/climate  variation,  but
with far-reaching consequences, is the El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO
has its roots in a coupled atmosphere-ocean interaction over the western Pacific, and
NASA has been monitoring ENSO with the TRMM and QuickSCAT satellites since
the  late  1990s.  The  QuickSCAT  satellite  provides  observations  of  reversing  trade
winds  that  accompany  El  Nin˜ o,  and  NASA  TRMM  scientists  have  investigated  sev-
eral  El  Nin˜ o  and  La  Nin˜ a  rainfall  cycles  of  varying  intensity  and  duration.  No  two
ENSO  events  are  alike,  and  continued  long-term  monitoring  of  ENSO  with  TRMM
will  increase  our  understanding  of  ENSO’s  peculiar  variations.  Precursors  to  El
Nin˜ o  such  as  the  short-term  Madden-Julian  Oscillation  (MJO)  have  been  identified
through  TRMM’s  unique  combination  of  rain  and  ocean  surface  temperature  meas-
urements.  As  the  key  linkage  between  MJO  and  ENSO  is  established,  there  is  the
hope that TRMM data sets will be used to increase the predictability of El Nin˜ o and
its impacts on the United States.

NASA’s  TOPEX/Poseidon  and  Jason–I  are  measuring  ocean  surface  topography,
the MODIS instrument on the EOS platforms also provides high-resolution observa-
tion  of  sea  surface  temperature.  The  Estimating  of  the  Circulation  and  Climate  of
the Ocean project sponsored by the National Oceanographic Partnership Program is
currently assimilating long-term ocean observation data into a physically consistent
climate  quality  data  set  for  the  climate  variability  research.  These  efforts  will  be
augmented  in  the  future  with  sea  surface  salinity  data  from  the  Aquarius  mission.
One aspect of climate change that has received much attention recently is changes
in  the  Earth’s  ice  covered  regions.  NASA  continues  to  advance  our  understanding
of  these  ice  processes  through  a  combination  EOS  missions,  e.g.,  the  Ice  Cloud  and
land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), the AMSR instrument on Aqua, and ongoing and
planned  activities  with  operational  and  interagency  partners,  such  as  the  Navy’s
SSM/I instrument, our partnership in Canada’s RADARSAT mission, and others.

The Research and Analysis Program currently supports—in addition to investiga-
tions  funded  by  individual  programs—two  major  climate-variability-related  cat-
egories  of  interdisciplinary  investigations.  These  are  in  the  areas  of  sea  level  rise
and  polar  feedbacks  in  the  climate  system,  both  of  which  have  been  identified  as
priorities  of  the  Climate  Change  Science  Program  and  Integrated  Earth  Observing
System (IEOS). We continue to work with our interagency partners to maximize in-
vestments in understanding the significant changes that have been occurring in the
Polar  Regions,  particularly  in  the  framework  of  the  upcoming  International  Polar
Year (2007–2008).
Q2. For  years,  there  has  been  a  major  focus  on  the  effects  of  greenhouse  gases,  the
thinning of the ozone, global warming, and the melting of the ice caps. It is my
assumption,  and  please  correct  me  if  I  am  wrong,  that  one  of  the  functions  of
a  Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS)  initiative  would  be  to
monitor such activity?

Q2a. As  an  interagency  and  international  effort,  what  effect  will  budget  cuts  to

NASA’s Earth Science program have on this initiative?

A2a. NASA  Earth  system  science  results  of  research  and  development  of  space-
based  observations  and  improved  modeling  capacity  are  recognized  as  contributing
nearly 100 instruments on 30 spacecraft for the International Global Earth Observa-
tion  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS).  NASA  Earth  science  applications  are  recognized
for contributing integrated system solutions to each of the nine societal benefit areas
highlighted in both the Strategic Plan for a U.S. Integrated Earth Observation Sys-
tem  (IEOS)  and  the  10-Year  Plan  for  a  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Sys-
tems.  The  entire  NASA  Earth  Science  budget  contributes  to  goals  and  objectives  of
U.S. participation in GEOSS. The contributions of NASA research results to GEOSS
is  not  a  separate  budget  line  or  project.  Thereby,  any  reductions  in  Earth  Science
funding  would  decrease  our  contribution  to  GEOSS.  NASA  plans  to  contribute  the
results of over $1B in Earth system science research and development per the Presi-
dent’s budget.

154

The  International  GEOSS  and  the  U.S.  IEOS  include  framework  architectures
that  can  accommodate  and  benefit  from  the  observations  and  predictions/forecasts
resulting  from  NASA  research  and  development  of  space-based  Earth  observation
systems;  including  the  ground  segments,  data  handling  capacity,  modeling,  com-
puting, knowledge, and applied sciences and system engineering.
Q2b. Is  it  expected  that  NASA  will  continue  with  the  GEOSS  initiative  in  FY  2006

and beyond? At what funding levels?

A2b. NASA’s  plans  for  research  and  development  of  Earth  observation  systems  in-
clude support for national and international priorities and goals, including the U.S.
IEOS  and  International  GEOSS.  The  GEOSS  is  architected  to  benefit  from  the  full
scope  of  the  results  of  NASA  research  and  development  programs,  flight  missions
and  applied  sciences  partnerships  on  benchmarking  enhancements  to  integrated
system  solutions  for  the  nine  societal  benefit  areas.  Per  the  response  above,  the
NASA budget for Earth science is the U.S. contribution to the research and develop-
ment  efforts  that  contribute  to  the  goals  and  objectives  of  serving  society  as  docu-
mented in the GEOSS 10-Year Implementation Plan.
Q2c. To  date,  what  role  has  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  played  in  the  Adminis-

tration’s new GEOSS initiative?

A2c. NASA  leadership  contributed  to  developing  and  refining  the  framework  and
architecture  of  the  U.S.  IEOS  and  International  GEOSS  plans.  The  plans  provide
guidance  in  the  direction  for  evolving  research  capacity  (including  NASA  contribu-
tions)  to  enable  improved  future  operational  systems.  NASA  contributes  to  the  na-
tional interagency activity through participation in the U.S. Group on Earth Obser-
vation,  a  subcommittee  of  the  Committee  on  Environment  and  Natural  Resources
(CENR).  NASA  senior  officials  serve  in  the  roles  of  Co-Chair  and  other  positions  of
the  USGEO  and  as  alternate  Co-Chair  for  the  Architecture  SubGroup  of  the  inter-
national Group on Earth Observations.

NASA  missions  (e.g.,  Terra,  Aqua,  and  Aura),  program  plans  (e.g.,  Earth  Science
strategies  and  implementation  plans)  and  results  (e.g.,  collaboration  with  EPA  on
enhancing  the  national  air  quality  Nowcasting  system)  are  recognized  through  the
USGEO and GEO as contributions to the IEOS and GEOSS.
Q3. I  also  have  the  privilege  of  serving  on  the  Financial  Services  Committee  and
have  had  the  opportunity  to  take  a  close  look  at  the  Administration’s  changes
to  housing  programs.  The  Administration  wants  to  consolidate  Community  De-
velopment  Block  Grants  and  six  other  HUD  programs  as  well  as  ten  other  pro-
grams from federal agencies to move them into the Commerce department, dras-
tically  reducing  funding  in  some  cases  and  making  minimal  cuts  in  others.  I
also  notice  that  in  the  same  fashion  at  the  Administration’s  request,  NASA  has
decided  to  combine  the  Earth  Science  and  solar  physics  programs  into  one
Earth-Sun  Science  program  that  has  been  incorporated  into  the  new  Science
Mission Directorate.
a. Which stand-alone projects within the Earth Science program will sustain the

most drastic cuts?

b. Do you believe the reorganization of NASA’s Earth Science program is a good

idea or a bad idea? Why?

c. Would  you  have  any  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of

NASA’s Earth Science program?

A3a,b,c. The  combination  of  the  former  Earth  Science  Enterprise  and  Sun-Earth
Connection  theme  of  the  Space  Science  Enterprise  into  a  single  unified  Earth-Sun
System Division has not led to cuts in any Earth science projects. Significant reduc-
tions  were  made  between  FY  2004  and  FY  2005  President’s  budgets.  In  FY  2006,
the  budget  submit  using  the  new  structure,  resulted  in  no  significant  reductions  to
Earth science.

The  creation  of  a  single  unified  Science  Mission  Directorate  and  the  grouping  of
the  former  Earth  Science  Enterprise  and  the  Sun-Earth  Connection  theme  of  the
former  Space  Science  Enterprise  into  a  single  unified  Earth-Sun  System  Division
was done to better position us to take advantages of potential synergies between for-
mally  different  organizations.  However,  the  time  elapsed  since  the  agency  trans-
formation that effected these changes is too short to determine whether the benefits
are being achieved.

NASA’s  Earth  Science  budgets  are  managed  overall  effectively.  We  feel  that  one
of the most important things that can be done to improve management is to assure
the  stability  of  the  program.  Firming  up  of  budgets  early  in  the  fiscal  year  is  also
very important, as it allows for early establishment of targets.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Berrien  Moore  III,  Director,  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Earth,  Oceans,

and Space, University of New Hampshire

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. In  your  written  testimony,  you  state  that  the  NAS  committee  recommends  that
NASA  and  NOAA  should  commission  an  independent  review  regarding  the
Landsat Data Continuity Mission. Please clarify why the committee believes the
Administration  should  perform  another  cost  benefit  analysis  of  the  decision  to
transition  the  Landsat  measurements  to  the  NPOESS  platform,  as  outlined  in
the Auguest 13, 2004 OSTP memo.

A1. In reference to the Landsat Data Continuity Mission, the Interim Report of the
National  Academy  of  Science’s  Decadal  Study  team  recommended  independent  ex-
ternal  reviews  that  involved  the  scientific  and  operational  users  that  focused  upon
suitability, capability, and timeliness of the (OLI).

Our  understanding  of  what  happened  to  the  Landsat  Continuity  Mission  can  be

summarized as follows:

Efforts  to  begin  implementing  a  successor  mission  to  Landsat  7,  called  the
Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), focused on a plan to purchase data meet-
ing LDCM specifications from a privately owned and commercially operated satellite
system beginning in March 2007. However, after an evaluation of proposals received
from  private  industry,  NASA  canceled  a  Request-for-Proposals  (RFP)  for  providing
the  required  data  in  September  2003.  Soon  after,  the  Executive  Office  of  the  Presi-
dent  formed  an  interagency  working  group  to  discuss  Landsat  data  continuity  in
light of the cancellation. A memorandum from the Office of Science and Technology
Policy  (OSTP),  signed  on  August  13,  2004  by  the  Director  of  OSTP,  Dr.  John
Marburger,  III,  summarizes  the  outcome  of  these  discussions.  The  memorandum
states  ‘‘the  Departments  of  Defense,  the  Interior,  and  Commerce  and  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration have agreed to take the following actions:

• ‘‘Transition  Landsat  measurements  to  an  operational  environment  through
the  incorporation  of  Landsat-type  sensors  on  the  National  Polar-orbiting
Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) platform;

• ‘‘Plan  to  incorporate  a  Landsat  imager  on  the  first  NPOESS  spacecraft

(known as C–1), currently scheduled for launch in late 2009;

• ‘‘Further  assess  options  to  mitigate  the  risks  to  data  continuity  prior  to  the

first NPOESS–Landsat mission, including a ‘bridge’ mission.’’

We  know  of  no  formal  study  that  actually  accessed  the  ‘‘bridge  mission’’  nor  do
we  believe  that  the  user  community  was  adequately  involved  in  the  formulation  of
the  13  August  2004  memorandum  from  OSTP.  We  certainly  applaud  the  steps  of
OSTP,  NASA,  NOAA,  and  USGS  to  help  assure  the  longer-term  future  of  Landsat,
but  we  believe  that  before  giving  up  on  the  bridge  mission  and  before  settling  on
NPOESS  as  the  implementation  platform  for  OLI,  there  should  be  an  independent
study weighing all the options.
Q2. During  the  hearing,  much  of  the  discussion  concerned  what  the  National  Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does not do. Could you please de-
scribe the Earth science that NOAA does support, its significance and how it dif-
fers  from  what  is  done  by  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
(NASA)?

A2. The  Earth  science  accomplished  through  NOAA  support  is  important  and  it  is,
as it should be, focused upon helping NOAA meets its operational mandates. NOAA
is  a  science-based  agency  with  regulatory,  operational,  and  information  service  re-
sponsibilities.  To  fulfill  these  responsibilities,  it  is  essential  that  NOAA  maintain  a
vigorous  and  forward-looking  research  enterprise  that  has  both  near  and  longer-
term goals, but it must be recognized that the operational (near-term) requirements
will always be a significant pressure upon the research enterprise. Moreover, in ad-
dition  to  having  to  respond  to  operational  concerns,  the  research  budget  at  NOAA
is relatively modest in comparison to the Earth science research effort at NASA. Fi-
nally, Earth science depends upon significant technological advances in order to ad-
dress  the  critical  difficult  challenges  of  today,  for  which  there  is  no  budget  nor  is
there  a  mandate  for  NOAA  to  mount  significant  technology  development  programs
that  are  needed  to  meet  today’s  and  tomorrow’s  scientific  and  operational  chal-
lenges.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:28 Apr 03, 2006 Jkt 020736 PO 00000 Frm 00159 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\042805\20736 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

156

In sum, the differences are a) NOAA’s operational mandate, and b) the relatively
modest  size  of  NOAA  research  budget  (a  significant  portion  is  consumed  by  the  30
NOAA  Laboratories  and  Centers  and  19  Joint  Institutes),  and  the  subsequent  lack
of a significant capability for advanced technology development.
Q3. What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  placing  NASA  instruments  on

NOAA platforms, assuming that the appropriate funding was provided?

A3. The advantages are increased collaboration, the ability to stage ‘‘pre-operational
instruments in an operational environment (which should smooth the transfer to op-
erations) and expanded access to space. The main disadvantages are the narrow se-
lection  of  orbits  and  launch  opportunities,  a  rather  limited  envelope  for  power,
weight, and other spacecraft resources, and the potential constraint on data transfer
and data processing. In addition, there is a concern that if NASA hands the instru-
ment over to NOAA, NASA then will not provide a Research and Analysis function
as it would for a purely NASA mission. This latter issue could be addressed by pol-
icy;  whereas,  the  narrow  selection  of  orbits,  launches,  and  space,  and  ground  re-
sources are more troubling.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  most  promising  future  benefits  that  the  Nation
might gain from continued investments in Earth science research? What will be
the negative impacts on society if NASA’s commitment to Earth science research
and applications is diminished in the coming year?

A1. Future  benefits.  Improved  scientific  understanding,  which  forms  the  foundation
for  practical  applications  that  enhance  the  prosperity  and  security  of  society.  Busi-
nesses,  government  agencies,  and  even  individuals  rely  on  products  and  services
that  have  emerged  from  Earth  science  research  programs.  For  example,  improve-
ments  in  the  ability  to  forecast  weather  have  had  an  enormous  impact  on  society.
Today’s four-day weather forecast is as accurate as two-day forecasts were 20 years
ago. The error in the three-day forecast landfall position of hurricanes has been re-
duced  from  about  210  miles  in  1985  to  about  110  miles  in  2004.  Sea  surface  winds
and  precipitation  can  be  observed  at  accuracies  that  allow  emergency  managers  to
more  efficiently  evacuate  coastal  residents  in  the  path  of  hurricanes.  As  a  result,
lives  are  saved  and  property  losses  are  minimized.  Increased  knowledge  about  the
ocean-atmosphere-land  system  suggests  that  similar  improvements  are  possible  in
seasonal  climate  forecasts,  which  are  needed  for  a  variety  of  agriculture  decisions.
Today,  we  can  track  vast  clouds  of  dust  and  pollution  from  their  source  on  con-
tinents  across  the  oceans,  permitting  health  alarms  to  be  sounded  effectively.  We
can  map  deformations  of  the  Earth’s  surface  and  evacuate  regions  that  may  soon
experience  volcanic  eruptions  or  landslides.  We  can  track  changes  in  soil  moisture
and then redirect food supplies to areas that may soon face drought and famine. We
can  monitor  long-term  changes  in  the  land  surface,  atmosphere,  and  oceans  and
thereby  characterize  the  impacts  of  human  activities  on  climate.  We  have  docu-
mented ozone loss in the stratosphere, resulting in the Montreal Protocol and termi-
nation of the production of the causative chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

Despite  many  successes  in  applying  Earth  science  information  to  improve  lives,
security,  and  the  economy,  we  have  the  ability  to  do  much  more.  The  increase  in
knowledge  produced  over  the  last  decade  by  Earth  scientists  is  itself  a  tremendous
societal benefit with clear public policy implications. And the experience in applying
that  knowledge  lays  a  solid  foundation  for  more  systematically  selecting  new  mis-
sions  that  address  not  only  important  scientific  issues  but  also  critical  societal
needs. New observations, analyses, better interpretive understanding, enhanced pre-
dictive  models,  broadened  community  participation,  and  improved  means  for  infor-
mation dissemination are all needed. If we meet this challenge, we will begin to re-
alize the full economic and security benefits of Earth science.

Negative  Impacts.  At  NASA,  the  vitality  of  Earth  science  and  application  pro-
grams  has  been  placed  at  substantial  risk  by  a  rapidly  shrinking  budget  that  no
longer supports already-approved missions and programs of high scientific and soci-
etal relevance. Opportunities to discover new knowledge about Earth are diminished
as  mission  after  mission  is  canceled,  descoped,  or  delayed  because  of  budget  cut-
backs.  These  reductions  and  the  change  in  priorities  jeopardize  NASA’s  ability  to
fulfill  its  obligations  in  (other)  important  presidential  initiatives,  such  as  the  Cli-
mate  Change  Research  Initiative  and  the  subsequent  Climate  Change  Science  Pro-
gram. It also calls into question future U.S. leadership in the Global Earth Observ-
ing  System  of  Systems,  an  international  effort  initiated  by  the  current  Administra-
tion.

This  substantial  reduction  in  Earth  observation  programs  today  will  result  in  a
loss of U.S. scientific and technical capacity, which will decrease the competitiveness
of  the  United  States  internationally  for  years  to  come.  U.S.  leadership  in  science,
technology development, and societal applications depends on sustaining competence
across a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines that include the Earth
sciences.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. The White House has proposed putting the Landsat imager on the first NPOESS

satellite, currently being developed by NOAA and DOD.
• What  are  the  technical  and  programmatic  risks  of  putting  the  new  Landsat
imaging  sensor  on  the  first  NPOESS  platform?  How  serious  are  those  risks?
• Is  the  Landsat  user  community  involved  in  determining  the  requirements  to

be met if the Landsat sensor is added to NPOESS?

A1. The main technical and programmatic risks are as follows:

a. Technical

1. Adequacy of the large NPOESS platform to adequately meet the pointing

and jitter requirements of the Operational Land Imager (OLI).

2. Operational  data  interface  from  the  Weather  Centrals  to  the  land  proc-

essing system.

b. Programmatic

1. Adequate  involvement  of  the  community  in  the  definition  of  the  instru-

ment performance requirements.

2. Impact  of  delay  in  the  launch  of  NPOESS  C–1  (first)  platform,  which
will  compound  the  impact  of  the  lack  of  a  bridge  mission  (see  my  com-
ments  attached  below  that  I  submitted  to  one  of  Chairman  Boehlert’s
questions).

3. Long-term commitment to process and distribute the data.
4. Uncertain policy of response to OLI instrument failure on orbit.

Q2. How do current NASA Earth science budgetary priorities and plans compare to
recommendations  made  by  the  National  Research  Council  over  the  past  five
years?

A2. Simply put, the current direction of Earth sciences is 180 degrees from the rec-
ommendations of the Earth sciences community as expressed through NRC reports.
NASA  is  cutting  or  delaying  recommended  missions  that  were  in  development,  and
it  is  not  responding  to  recommendations  for  other  new  missions;  the  Research  and
Development  monies  are  being  cut  and  opportunities  for  graduate  education  are
being diminished. By and large, NASA is heading in the opposite direction from re-
peated recommendations of the Earth sciences community.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. I  also  have  the  privilege  of  serving  on  the  Financial  Services  Committee  and
have  had  the  opportunity  to  take  a  close  look  at  the  Administration’s  changes
to  housing  programs.  The  Administration  wants  to  consolidate  Community  De-
velopment  Block  Grants  and  six  other  HUD  programs  as  well  as  ten  other  pro-
grams from federal agencies to move them into the Commerce department, dras-
tically  reducing  funding  in  some  cases  and  making  minimal  cuts  in  others.  I
also  notice  that  in  the  same  fashion  at  the  Administration’s  request,  NASA  has
decided to combine the Earth science and solar physics programs into one Earth-
Sun  Science  program  that  has  been  incorporated  into  the  new  Science  Mission
directorate.

Q1a. Which  stand-alone  projects  within  the  Earth  science  program  will  sustain  the

most drastic cuts?

A1a. I  believe  that  the  Interim  report  captures  the  stand-alone  projects  most  se-
verely cut through its list (Table 3.1 from the Interim Report attached below) of mis-
sions  that  are  either  delayed,  canceled,  or  descoped.  In  addition,  I  believe  that  the
next  is  the  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  program,  which  currently  does  not
have  sufficient  funds  to  execute  in  a  timely  fashion  the  mission  that  have  been  se-

lected in the ESSP–3 set and no monies for ESSP–4 Request for Proposals. Address-
ing the issues implicit in the Table and ESSP would be my top priority.
Q1b. Do  you  believe  the  reorganization  of  NASA’s  Earth  science  program  is  a  good

idea or a bad idea? Why?

A1b. I  do  not  have  a  strong  view  on  combining  Earth  and  solar  physics—I  know
that it can work productively since these sciences are combined in a single institute
at  UNH  and  they  were  combined  in  the  1980s  at  NASA.  I  do  not  think  that  this
is a major issue.
Q1c. Would  you  have  any  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of

NASA’s Earth Science program?

A1c. The  development  a  coherent  Decadal  View  is  the  next  critical  step-this  is  the
responsibility of the community through the NRC study. When this is accomplished
and  adequately  reviewed,  then  I  believe  that  NASA  must  align  its  program  with
that expressed view. For the moment, we must stop the bleeding so that the patient
does not die.

Responses by Timothy L. Killeen, Director, National Center for Atmospheric Research

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. During  the  hearing,  much  of  the  discussion  concerned  what  the  National  Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does not do. Could you please de-
scribe the Earth science that NOAA does support, its significance and how it dif-
fers  from  what  is  done  by  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
(NASA).

A1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plays an impor-
tant  role  in  performing  and  supporting  Earth  science  research  in  the  U.S.  NOAA
and  NASA  are  the  only  U.S.  civil  agencies  that  fund  the  design,  development  and
operation  of  Earth  observing  satellites  that  provide  global-scale  measurements  of
the  Earth  system,  and  both  agencies  also  support  a  wide  variety  of  modeling  and
research  activities  that  include  efforts  focused  on  weather  prediction,  climate
change, and oceans. There are, however, a number of important differences.

NOAA’s  research  focuses  mainly  on  study  of  the  atmosphere  and  oceans  (as  the
agency name implies), and is largely focused on supporting NOAA’s operational mis-
sion.  NOAA  certainly  plays  a  leading  role  in  research  relevant  to  weather  pre-
diction,  although  many  other  agencies,  including  NASA  and  NSF  are  also  active  in
this  area.  NOAA  plays  a  very  important  role  in  climate  change  research  and,  par-
ticularly,  in  climate  change  observations.  NOAA’s  ongoing  work  in  measuring  the
CO2 concentration  in  the  atmosphere  is  one  of  the  fundamental  building  blocks  of
climate  change  science,  with  a  high  quality  record  that  extends  back  to  the  late
1950’s.  Its  effort  to  establish  a  climate  reference  network  of  precise  and  ideally
placed stations to measure temperature, precipitation, and wind speeds will likewise
prove very beneficial to scientists and decision-makers if it is strongly supported by
the  Administration  and  Congress  over  the  long-term.  And  NOAA  ocean  measure-
ments  and  analyses  have  helped  explain  the  role  of  the  ocean  in  storing  much  of
the  energy  retained  in  the  Earth  system  as  a  consequence  of  the  human-induced
build-up  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  Earth’s  atmosphere.  NOAA  has  also  been  a
leader in improving our understanding of climate variability as well as longer-term
climate  change.  The  network  of  NOAA  buoys  in  the  tropical  Pacific  has  helped  ex-
plain the El Nin˜ o-Southern Oscillation and its impacts.

NASA  has  supported  a  broader  program  of  Earth  science  and  global  change  re-
search that includes significant efforts in land use and land cover change, terrestrial
ecology, and solid Earth/geology, which are not prominent in NOAA research. In ad-
dition  to  its  broader  scope,  NASA  has  been  a  much  larger  supporter  of  university-
based  research.  Leaving  spacecraft  and  data  system  costs  aside,  AAAS  analyses
show  that  NASA  was  the  third  largest  provider  of  competitively  awarded  extra
mural funding for the university environmental science community in 2004, trailing
only  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  Even
small reductions in the NASA program have large effects in the university commu-
nity. As I noted in my testimony before the Committee, such reductions have a neg-
ative  affect  on  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  education  and  training,  and  thus
on  the  technical  capabilities  of  our  nation’s  future  workforce.  In  contrast,  NOAA  is
not a significant provider of peer-reviewed competitive research opportunities for the
academic  community,  instead  spending  most  of  its  research  funding  on  intramural
work that is conducted in its own labs.
Q2. What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  placing  NASA  instruments  on

NOAA platforms, assuming that the appropriate funding was provided?

A2. In general, there is no direct scientific advantage to placing NASA instruments
on  NOAA  platforms.  There  could  be  budgetary  savings  for  NASA  if  it  did  not  have
to pay for spacecraft development or operation. But NOAA would have to bear these
costs,  which  would  require  significant  increases  in  the  NOAA  budget.  It  does  not
appear  that  shifting  the  responsibility  for  some  part  of  overall  mission  costs  from
one  agency  to  another  will  reduce  the  overall  expense  to  taxpayers.  The  only  sce-
nario where one can imagine significant savings is if a single instrument can serve
both  NOAA  and  NASA  purposes.  But  the  significant  differences  between  NASA
science  needs  and  NOAA  operational  needs  make  such  opportunities  difficult  to
identify.

It is possible that societal benefits could accrue from tighter integration of NASA
and  NOAA  satellite  activities  related  to  weather  forecasting  if  such  integration  re-
sulted in more rapid and effective transition of advanced research capabilities to op-

erations. However, NOAA and NASA activity in this area is already much more in-
tegrated than commonly realized, with NASA responsible for the construction, inte-
gration,  and  verification  testing  of  the  spacecraft,  instruments,  and  unique  ground
equipment  operated  by  NOAA.  Satellites  are  handed  off  to  NOAA  after  they  are
checked  out  on-orbit.  This  responsibility  will  be  taken  over  by  the  Air  Force  when
the  U.S.  begins  operation  of  the  joint  DOD–NOAA–NASA  National  Polar-orbiting
Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), which will replace the cur-
rent  generation  of  polar  orbiting  weather  satellites  in  about  2008.  Provision  of
NASA  research  instruments  to  such  a  system  could  provide  research  and  oper-
ational  benefits,  but  this  requires  that  the  overall  program  is  provided  with  suffi-
cient  budgets  and  managed  in  such  a  fashion  that  it  can  ingest  and  make  use  of
continued advances in capabilities.

There are important Earth science questions that can only be addressed by main-
taining  accurate  space  based  measurements  for  very  long  periods  of  time,  particu-
larly in climate change, solar, and land cover change research. One can make a ra-
tional argument that a set of long-term research instruments should be included on
NOAA  operational  satellites  that  are  expected  to  be  maintained  as  part  of  our  na-
tion’s  permanent  infrastructure.  But  this  only  makes  sense  if  there  is  a  long-term
budgetary  commitment  to  developing  and  maintaining  the  advanced  instrumenta-
tion  needed  to  produce  research-quality  measurements.  Experience  to  date  is  not
particularly  encouraging  in  this  regard,  with  Landsat  providing  an  unfortunate  ex-
ample  of  major  difficulties  in  maintaining  long-term  support  for  high-quality  re-
search  measurements,  even  when  they  also  serve  many  practical,  nearly  ‘‘oper-
ational’’ purposes.

It  should  also  be  remembered  that  NASA  is  currently  flying  three  large  Earth
science  satellite  systems  carrying  a  total  of  15  different  instruments,  along  with
about 14 smaller Earth science missions carrying 1–3 instruments each. NOAA cur-
rently  operates  four  satellites  at  a  time.  Transferring  even  a  small  subset  of  NASA
instrumentation  onto  NOAA  satellites  implies  a  significant  increase  in  the  number
and/or capabilities of these systems (instruments require power, space, and commu-
nications capacity), which will require substantial additional funding over and above
the  amounts  required  for  instrument  design  and  development.  Such  a  step  is  also
likely  to  require  substantial  additions  to  NOAA  staffing,  perhaps  by  transferring
large numbers of NASA employees to NOAA. Conversely, significantly reducing the
number  of  research  instruments  that  can  be  flown  would  significantly  reduce  the
scope of U.S. efforts to document and understand the planet upon which we live and
depend.

The  primary  disadvantage  of  flying  NASA  research  instruments  on  NOAA  oper-
ational  platforms  is  the  difficulty  of  merging  the  differing  management  require-
ments for operational and research systems. The primary purpose of NOAA systems
is protection of life and property, which translates into a set of overarching manage-
ment  requirements.  Science  will  be  a  junior  partner  in  such  systems,  and  oper-
ational requirements are almost certain to override science requirements if there is
a conflict between them. This is appropriate, but also represents a potential cost to
our  nation’s  science  efforts.  For  example,  a  key  instrument  failure  requires  rapid
launch  of  a  replacement  NOAA  satellite,  even  if  the  other  instruments  are  still
working.  The  old  satellite  is  then  turned  off.  Adapting  research  instrumentation  to
such a system either requires (a) the purchase of multiple instrument copies so that
the  ‘‘hot  spares’’  can  include  replacement  research  instruments  or  (b)  additional  re-
search  funding  to  support  continued  satellite  operations  if  operational  instruments
fail.

In  summary,  it  is  possible  that  flight  of  NASA  instruments  on  NOAA  satellites
could  provide  benefits  to  both  the  science  and  operational  communities,  and  to  our
nation as a whole, but only if adequate budgets are provided over the long-term and
strong  and  effective  interagency  management  mechanisms  are  put  in  place.  Main-
taining an appropriate balance of scientific and operational requirements and prior-
ities would be very challenging in such an arrangement, but is critical to achieving
success. This kind of program integration is not likely to result in significant overall
savings  or  efficiencies  unless  single  instruments  can  be  made  to  serve  operational
and  research  purposes.  Reduction  in  the  budgets  devoted  to  Earth  science  satellite
missions  and/or  the  numbers  of  Earth  science  instruments  that  are  developed  and
operated  will  slow  the  rate  at  which  we  improve  our  understanding  of  the  Earth
system and how changes in the Earth system affect its capacity to sustain life.

the negative impacts on society if NASA’s commitment to Earth science research
and applications is diminished in the coming years?

A1. As I stated when I testified before the Committee, I believe that rapid advances
in NASA Earth observing capabilities, coupled with revolutionary advances in infor-
mation technology, have positioned us for an extraordinary new era in Earth science
research—one  in  which  we  can  quantitatively  understand  and  predict  the  Earth  as
a system, with the temporal and spatial fidelity needed by decision-makers at many
levels of our society: local, regional, and global. This will lead directly to major soci-
etal benefits including:

• improved national security
• better weather forecasts and warnings
• more targeted climate outlooks
• better management of natural resources including water, agriculture, and en-

ergy

• more  effective  mitigation  of  natural  disasters  such  as  drought,  floods,  land-

slides, and volcanic eruptions.

The investments made in Earth science programs at NASA, the National Science
Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department
of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other agencies are all important for ena-
bling  this  progress.  But  NASA  plays  a  unique  role  in  our  overall  national  efforts
as  the  only  provider  of  research-quality  (i.e.,  well  documented  and  very  accurate)
global  scale  measurements  from  space.  Reducing  our  investment  in  NASA  Earth
sciences  program  will  slow  the  rate  at  which  we  improve  our  understanding  of  the
Earth system and how changes in that system affect its capacity to sustain life. Re-
duced investment will also slow the rate at which we develop new practical applica-
tions of scientific knowledge will provide the benefits listed above, even as other na-
tions are increasing their investments and expertise in this area.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. I  also  have  the  privilege  of  serving  on  the  Financial  Services  Committee  and
have  had  the  opportunity  to  take  a  close  look  at  the  Administration’s  changes
to  housing  programs.  The  Administration  wants  to  consolidate  Community  De-
velopment  Block  Grants  and  six  other  HUD  programs  as  well  as  ten  other  pro-
grams from federal agencies to move them into the Commerce department, dras-
tically  reducing  funding  in  some  cases  and  making  minimal  cuts  in  others.  I
also  notice  that  in  the  same  fashion  at  the  Administration’s  request,  NASA  has
decided to combine the Earth science and solar physics programs into one Earth-
Sun  Science  program  that  has  been  incorporated  into  the  new  Science  Mission
Directorate.

Q1a. Which  stand-alone  projects  within  the  Earth  science  program  will  sustain  the

most drastic cuts?

A1a. This  question  is  most  appropriately  addressed  by  NASA  managers.  I  do  not
have access to their internal decision processes about exactly how they will allocate
budget  reductions  that  are  proposed  by  the  Administration  and  approved  by  Con-
gress. As an Earth scientist, I am particularly concerned about a set of actions iden-
tified in the recent report from the National Research Council, including:

• Cancellation of the Ocean Vector Winds mission
• Cancellation of the Landsat Data Continuity mission
• Cancellation of the Glory mission
• Cancellation of the Wide Swath Ocean Altimeter
• Cancellation of the Geostationary Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer
• Delay of the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission

In  a  more  general  sense,  I  am  quite  worried  about  the  possibility  that  additional
budget  reductions  will  fall  disproportionately  on  the  Research  and  Analysis  compo-
nent  of  the  NASA  program,  which  supports  the  involvement  of  the  academic  com-
munity  in  NASA  programs  and  enables  the  creation  of  knowledge  and  useful  infor-
mation from space-based measurements.
Q1b. Do  you  believe  the  reorganization  of  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  is  a  good

idea or a bad idea? Why?

A1b. I  believe  that  it  is  up  to  NASA  and  those  in  the  Congress  and  Executive
branch who are responsible for oversight of NASA to agree on the most appropriate
organizational structure for the Agency and its programs. However, I am concerned
that the combination of NASA’s Earth and Space science programs into a single or-
ganization  and  the  reduction  of  funding  for  both  Earth  and  Space  science  is  part
of  an  overall  process  of  reducing  NASA  science  funding  and  applying  it  to  other
agency priorities. I believe this is a serious mistake. In my view, our nation is better
served  by  a  balanced  NASA  program  that  provides  strong  support  to  both  science
and human space flight and exploration funding, and I would thus respectfully sug-
gest continued maintenance of the traditional ‘‘firewall’’ between science and human
space flight funding.
Q1c. Would  you  have  any  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of

NASA’s Earth Science program?

A1c. As I stated when I testified before the Committee, I believe that NASA should
work  with  the  scientific  and  technical  community  and  its  partner  agencies  in  the
Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) to define a NASA Earth science plan that
is  fully  compatible  with  the  overall  CCSP  science  strategy.  In  my  view,  the  inter-
action  with  the  scientific  and  technical  community  should  include  both  input  from
and  review  by  the  National  Research  Council  and  direct  interaction  with  the  com-
munity  of  investigators  who  are  supported  by  NASA,  and  the  aerospace  industry
who are very familiar with NASA capabilities and developing technological opportu-
nities.  I  believe  NASA  should  also  find  a  means  of  involving  users  and  potential
users of NASA-generated data in this process, perhaps through public comment pe-
riods  or  a  series  of  workshops.  This  science  plan  should  then  guide  the  process  of
setting mission priorities.

Defining  criteria  to  use  in  comparing  and  deciding  upon  potential  mission  would
be  an  important  part  of  this  planning  exercise.  I  would  recommend  consideration
of a set of criteria that include:

• Compatibility with science priorities in the plan
• Potential scientific return from mission
• Technological risk
• Direct and indirect societal benefits
• Cost.

I  believe  that  the  decadal  planning  activity  underway  at  the  NRC  in  response  to

a request from NASA and NOAA is a valuable step in this process.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Sean C. Solomon, Director, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Car-

negie Institution of Washington

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. During  the  hearing,  much  of  the  discussion  concerned  what  the  National  Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does not do. Could you please de-
scribe the Earth science that NOAA does support, its significance and how it dif-
fers  from  what  is  done  by  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration
(NASA)?

A1. There are two fundamental differences between NOAA and NASA. First, NOAA
is  primarily  an  operational  or  monitoring  agency,  whereas  NASA’s  strength  is  the
ability  to  develop  innovative  technologies  that  enable  new  types  of  measurements
and  new  discoveries  about  how  the  Earth  functions  as  a  planet.  Second,  NOAA’s
charter is focused on the oceans and atmosphere, whereas NASA takes a planetary
perspective,  one  that  integrates  the  land  surface  and  interior  with  the  oceans  and
atmosphere  as  well  as  the  Earth’s  space  environment.  Both  NASA  and  NOAA  play
important  roles  for  Earth  science  and  for  this  nation,  but  those  roles  are  distinct.
This nation is stronger because of the complementarity and cooperation between the
two agencies.
Q2. What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  placing  NASA  instruments  on

NOAA platforms, assuming that the appropriate funding was provided?

A2. Certainly there are often economies to be gained in situations where NASA can
place  an  instrument  on  a  space  platform  operated  by  another  federal  agency  or
international partner. Such situations can save the cost of a dedicated satellite and
can  provide  greater  access  to  space  flight.  The  principal  disadvantages,  in  contrast,
are  that  the  choice  of  orbital  characteristics,  mission  operations,  or  data  manage-
ment  for  one  mission  may  not  be  optimum  for  another  experiment,  leading  to  com-
promises in experiment goals and lessened scientific impact. Each such opportunity
needs to be evaluated in light of the full trade-off among benefits and costs.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  most  promising  future  benefits  that  the  Nation
might gain from continued investments in Earth science research? What will be
the negative impacts on society if NASA’s commitment to Earth science research
and applications is diminished in the coming years?

A1. We still have much to learn about how our planet functions. Continued invest-
ment  in  Earth  science  can  deepen  our  understanding  of  how  our  atmosphere  pro-
tects and sustains us, how Earth’s climate and weather are evolving, what controls
the  availability  of  fresh  water,  how  life  influences  and  responds  to  environmental
processes,  and  what  controls  changes  to  the  Earth’s  surface  and  interior.  A  dimin-
ished investment by this nation in new technologies for studying our planet will im-
pact deleteriously our ability to mitigate natural disasters; make the best use of our
land, ocean, and fresh-water resources; and better the lives of all of Earth’s citizens.

• Would  you  have  any  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of

NASA’s Earth Science program?

A1. The  specific  form  of  organization  at  NASA  is  less  important  than  the  vision
brought  to  the  strategic  planning  process  used  to  develop  mission  concepts  and
prioritize new programs. During the late 1980s and early 1990s the Earth and space
sciences  were  combined  into  one  office  at  NASA,  and  all  elements  of  the  Agency’s
sciences programs fared equitably.

There are ongoing efforts at strategic planning that should improve the effective-
ness of NASA’s program in Earth science and applications. The first decadal survey
for Earth science and applications from space, now underway under the aegis of the
National Academy of Sciences, is an important indicator that the Earth science com-
munity has embraced the need to integrate its planning and prioritization processes.
NASA’s scientific roadmapping efforts that were completed earlier this year and are
now  under  review  by  the  National  Research  Council  constitute  a  parallel,  com-
plementary  strategic  planning  activity  that  has  produced  focused  recommendations
for the most important next steps for the Agency’s Earth Science program.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Marcia McNutt, President and CEO, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research

Institute

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. During the hearing, much of the discussion concerned what NOAA does not do.
Could you please describe the Earth science that NOAA does support, its signifi-
cance and how it differs from what is done by NASA?

A1. The closest analogy I can make in trying to distinguish the different roles visa-
a´-vis  NOAA  and  NASA  with  regard  to  Earth  science  is  to  say  that  NOAA  is  the
ultimate consumer of scientific information, whereas NASA is a creator of scientific
information.  As  a  consumer,  NOAA  would  thrive  if  it  could  satisfy  its  appetite  for
Earth science information using systems developed, deployed, and operated by other
agencies.  For  many  years,  NOAA  got  its  space-based  Earth  science  information
using  NASA  satellites,  sensors,  and  data  systems.  However,  NOAA  couldn’t  guar-
antee  that  the  diet  for  Earth  science  data  that  it  had  become  accustomed  to  and
that  it  required  to  meet  its  mission-specific  obligations  would  always  be  provided
by  NASA,  given  NASA’s  basic  research  objectives.  Therefore,  it  made  sense  for
NOAA to replicate satellite missions that NASA had already developed, tested, and
proven once the NASA prototypes were no longer serviceable. In fact, this approach
was  good  for  both  agencies,  because  it  freed  up  NASA  resources  in  the  Earth
sciences to work on better, more precise instrumentation and new sensors that could
measure important quantities that had never been acquired from space before.

If  all  that  was  at  stake  here  was  continuing  a  time  series  using  existing  instru-
ments  on  standard  platforms  (e.g.,  the  TOMS—Total  Ozone  Mapping  Spectrom-
eter—missions that measure the evolution of the ozone hole), I would be comfortable
with  the  idea  that  NOAA  could  pick  up  that  part  of  the  program.  However,  that
is  not  what  is  being  proposed.  Missions  in  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  that  are
prototypes of new measurements from space are being canceled or indefinitely post-
poned.  NOAA  does  not  have  the  history  or  the  technology  base  or  the  mission  to
take on these new developments. Furthermore, NASA is developing new sensor sys-
tems  for  Earth  science  applications  that  don’t  necessarily  fit  with  NOAA’s  oceanic
and  atmospheric  mission  (e.g.,  synthetic  aperture  radar—SAR—for  earthquake  and
volcano  hazard  assessment)  and  that  therefore  would  never  be  taken  up  by  NOAA.
The  SAR  probably  does  fit  in  with  the  mission  of  the  USGS,  but  space-based  SAR
is never going to be developed and brought to operational status by USGS, at least
not in any affordable way.

The  bottom  line  is  the  following.  If  NOAA  were  to  take  on  all  of  NASA’s  Earth
science research program, it would only be successful if it spun up a technology de-
velopment group in order to create the new sensors and platforms necessary for the
next generation of important problems. But this would be a needless and expensive
duplication  of  what  NASA  is  doing  already.  NASA’s  mission  is  to  explore  the  uni-
verse. Technology development is essential to achieve that objective. The technology
developments  needed  for  exploration  and  research  and  (eventually)  operations  are
basically  indistinguishable  because  they  are  all  part  of  the  same  continuum.  It  has
made  economic  sense  for  many  years  for  NASA  to  be  the  technology  innovator  in
Earth  sciences,  and  leave  it  to  the  other  agencies  to  adopt  and  continue  the  most
successful  of  those  programs,  as  measured  by  the  importance  of  the  acquired  data
to their missions.
Q2. What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  placing  NASA  instruments  on

NOAA platforms, assuming that the appropriate funding was provided?

A2. I  believe  that  it  would  be  possible  to  fly  a  NASA  instrument  on  a  NOAA  plat-
form  IF  the  platform  could  support  the  instrument,  IF  the  orbit  were  conducive  to
the  measurement  being  made,  and  IF  NASA  were  still  fundamentally  in  charge  of
the  development  of  the  instrument  and  the  shepherding  of  the  data  stream  while
the  instrument  is  still  in  the  developmental  stages.  After  all,  NASA  has  done  ex-
actly this with other international space agencies, so it should be possible to do this
with  NASA.  But  these  are  a  lot  of  ‘‘if’s,  and  as  I  understand  it,  this  is  not  what
is  on  the  table.  NASA  has  reprogrammed  money  out  of  Earth  science,  so  there  is
no funding to transfer to NOAA to cover the costs, and more than just the launches
and  the  platforms  have  been  cut  from  the  program.  The  better  way  to  do  just  this
is to leave the funding in a NASA Earth Science program, and create an interagency
transfer mechanism to permit NASA Earth Sciences to purchase the launch and the

space  on  a  NOAA  platform  when  that  indeed  is  the  most  cost  effective  way  to  ac-
complish the mission.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  most  promising  future  benefits  that  the  Nation
might gain from continued investments in Earth science research? What will be
the negative impacts on society if NASA’s commitment to Earth science research
and applications is diminished in the coming years?

A1. Some  benefits  we  can  already  anticipate  because  they  are  already  coming  over
our  horizon.  For  example,  I  firmly  believe  that  a  continued  investment  in  NASA’s
Earth Science research and application program is critical to the Nation’s economy,
with  the  sectors  most  likely  to  benefit  including  energy,  agriculture,  and  transpor-
tation.  And  these  are  certainly  not  ‘‘fringe’’  elements  of  the  U.S.  economy!  What
these  sectors  all  have  in  common  is  the  necessity  to  make  predictions  to  optimize
the  scheduling  and  deployment  of  resources  in  order  to  provide  services  to  society
in a cost effective manner. Why plant a crop poorly suited to the projected rain fall
in  the  coming  season  if  another  crop  will  thrive  under  those  same  conditions?  A
largely  failed  crop  is  a  needless  waste  of  the  grower’s  resources  and  leads  to  high
prices at the grocery stores for the consumers.

Doubtlessly the most important benefits are the ones that we hardly dare predict
yet. But let me be so bold as to suggest an example. The GRACE (Gravity Recovery
and  Climate  Experiment)  mission  was  launched  in  March,  2002,  as  part  of  the
Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder  program.  The  GRACE  mission  detects  changes  in
Earth’s  gravity  field  by  monitoring  the  changes  in  distance  between  two  satellites
as  they  orbit  Earth.  GRACE’s  measurements  are  so  precise  that  the  satellite  has
been  able  to  detect  seasonal  and  longer  period  changes  in  groundwater  storage  be-
neath  the  land  surface.  As  a  resident  of  the  Salinas  Valley,  I  can  attest  to  the  im-
portance of groundwater as a storage mechanism for temporally redistributing fresh
water from the season when rain falls—the California winter—to the other seasons
when it is needed to grow crops, fight fires, etc. Monitoring changes in water storage
in the planet’s great aquifers from space makes a lot of sense because the measure-
ment is not limited to locations where there are wells and is insensitive to the com-
plication that where rain falls may be different from where the water is stored. The
gravity signal averages out local variations and provides a consistent standard from
region to region and continent to continent. Fresh water is one of society’s most val-
uable  and  threatened  resources.  I  anticipate  that  missions  such  as  GRACE  will  be
important in helping us properly manage our fresh water supply.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. I  also  have  the  privilege  of  serving  on  the  Financial  Services  Committee  and
have  had  the  opportunity  to  take  a  close  look  at  the  Administration’s  changes
to  housing  programs.  The  Administration  wants  to  consolidate  Community  De-
velopment  Block  Grants  and  six  other  HUD  programs  as  well  as  ten  other  pro-
grams from federal agencies to move them into the Commerce department, dras-
tically  reducing  funding  in  some  cases  and  making  minimal  cuts  in  others.  I
also  notice  that  in  the  same  fashion  at  the  Administration’s  request,  NASA  has
decided  to  combine  the  Earth  Science  and  solar  physics  programs  into  one
Earth-Sun  Science  program  that  has  been  incorporated  into  the  new  Science
Mission Directorate.

Q1a. Which  stand-alone  projects  within  the  Earth  Science  program  will  sustain  the

most drastic cuts?

A1a. I  will  defer  to  Mr.  Diaz  to  answer  this  question,  as  I  understand  that  NASA
has not necessarily finalized its plan for which programs will sustain the most dras-
tic cuts and that there are some semantic issues on whether at this point some mis-
sions  are  cut  or  simply  ‘‘postponed.’’  However,  I  will  add  that  in  my  experience,
drawing a project out over a longer time scale adds more to the cost to get the same
result. It is not an effective use of resources.
Q1b. Do  you  believe  the  reorganization  of  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  is  a  good

idea or a bad idea? Why?

A1b. I think it is a bad idea. I believe that the re-organization has a high likelihood
of marginalizing Earth sciences at the Agency. External scrutiny of the distribution
of  resources  between  Earth  and  spaces  sciences  will  be  greatly  reduced,  allowing
space science to raid whatever budget is left in Earth science. Like it or not, Earth

is the only planet we will have to sustain us for a very long time. NASA’s research
is  so  key  to  our  future  on  this  planet  that  to  downgrade  its  status  in  the  Agency
is exactly the opposite of what should be done.
Q1c. Would  you  have  any  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of

NASA’s Earth Science program?

A1c. I am a fan of Goldin’s philosophy. I think we should be doing more of the type
of  research  that  was  encouraged  through  the  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinder
(ESSP)  program.  I  prefer  that  to  the  large  space  platforms  that  try  to  house  every
conceivable  instrument,  and  result  in  undesirable  trade-offs  in  terms  of  orbit,  alti-
tude, etc., and take forever to get launched.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Ray  A.  Williamson,  Research  Professor,  Space  Policy  Institute,  George

Washington University

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. During the hearing much of the discussion concerned what the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) does not do. Could you please describe
the  Earth  science  that  NOAA  does  support,  its  significance  and  how  it  differs
from what is done by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)?
A1. NOAA  tends  to  support  applied  science,  that  science  that  directly  supports  the
needs  of  the  American  public,  such  as  weather  forecasting,  how  the  U.S.  coastline
is  changing  under  the  effects  of  global  warming,  and  how  periodic  medium-  and
long-term  changes  in  ocean  temperature  may  affect  fish  and  marine  populations
upon which the U.S. populations depend for sustenance.

NASA,  on  the  other  hand  conducts  research  into  more  basic  Earth  science  ques-
tions,  such  as  how  space  technologies  can  support  basic  science  research  into  the
underlying Earth systems and how they interact with each other. What are the fun-
damental mechanisms of weather and climate and how can this knowledge be used
to build more accurate weather and climate bio-physical-chemical models of Earth’s
weather and climate behavior?
Q2. What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  placing  NASA  instruments  on

NOAA platforms, assuming that the appropriate funding was provided?

A2. The  answer  to  this  question  depends  heavily  on  the  precise  function  of  the  in-
strument  in  question,  and  the  specific  orbital  parameters  of  the  NOAA  spacecraft
compared  to  that  of  the  NASA  sensor  under  consideration.  Each  orbit  has  its  own
particular  characteristics.  In  some  cases,  an  appropriate  fit  may  be  found  between
NASA sensor and NOAA spacecraft. In other cases, the missions of both sensor and
spacecraft  would  have  to  be  compromised  substantially  in  order  to  put  them  to-
gether.  In  the  case  of  the  Landsat  sensor  and  the  Congressional  mandate  to  main-
tain  the  continuity  of  data  delivery  from  the  instrument,  placing  a  Landsat-equiva-
lent  sensor  on  the  NPOESS  satellites  means  that  the  Landsat  sensor  would  fly  in
a  different  orbit,  causing  several  differences  in  the  characteristics  of  the  data  ac-
quired.  Extensive  experimentation  with  the  resulting  data  by  several  different  cat-
egories  of  users  would  be  required  in  order  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  dif-
ferences are sufficient to require major changes in the operational characteristics of
the users’ data analysis systems. In the long run, such changes in operations might
cost  more  to  the  users  than  is  saved  through  placing  the  instrument  on  the
NPOESS satellites.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  most  promising  future  benefits  that  the  Nation
might gain from continued investments in Earth science research? What will be
the negative impacts on society if NASA’s commitment to Earth science research
and applications is diminished in the coming years?

A1. Continued investments in Earth science research can, if adequately funded, re-
sult in numerous benefits for the Nation, a selection of which are listed below. Con-
versely, reduced funding can lead to loss of these potential benefits, not only directly
from  the  loss  of  NASA’s  involvement  in  promoting  new  applications  of  its  research,
but also in the loss over the long-term of the scientific knowledge such research pro-
vides.

• Improved  management  of  natural  resources  by  federal  agencies  and  crop

management by agricultural firms

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. The White House has proposed putting the Landsat imager on the first NPOESS

satellite, currently being developed by NOAA and DOD.

Q1a. What are the technical and programmatic risks of putting the new Landsat im-

aging sensor on the first NPOESS platform? How serious are those risks?

A1a. The current Landsat system is one of the most capable and versatile land ob-
servation  systems  available  anywhere.  When  operating  at  full  capacity,  Landsat  7
was  capable  of  producing  maps  of  the  entire  United  States  each  season,  data  that
are  very  useful  for  tracking  seasonal  changes.  Data  are  used  for  a  wide  variety  of
purposes,  from  land  planning,  environmental  management,  agricultural  manage-
ment,  and  for  large-scale  studies  of  environmental  change.  They  are  often  the  first
data  sets  that  users  turn  to  in  order  to  have  a  general  overview  of  the  landscape
under study and often serve as a foundation for more detailed analysis with higher
resolution  data  with  much  less  extensive  coverage.  For  the  sensor  to  be  placed  on
the  NPOESS  satellites,  several  technical  issues  would  need  to  be  resolved,  the  de-
tails  of  which  depend  strongly  on  the  needs  of  data  users,  such  as  orbital  height,
swath-width of the sensor, the number and placement of spectral channels, and the
frequency  of  coverage.  Current  users  of  Landsat  data  have  built  their  processing
and analytic systems around the characteristics of current Landsat data. Hence, any
changes in the characteristics of the data sets have far reaching consequences to the
many users of Landsat data.
Q1b. Is the Landsat user community involved in determining the requirements to be

met if the Landsat sensor is added to NPOESS?

A1b. It is my understanding that the Landsat data user community is generally op-
posed to placing the Landsat sensor on NPOESS because most users do not feel that
it will continue to serve their needs. However, if the Administration decides to move
ahead  with  that  transition  anyway,  the  needs  of  the  user  community  would  cer-
tainly  need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  order  to  encourage  those  users  to  continue
making use of the data.

Questions submitted by Representative Al Green
Q1. At the Administration’s request, NASA has decided to combine the Earth science
and  solar  physics  programs  into  one  Earth-Sun  science  program  that  has  been
incorporated into the new Science Mission Directorate.

Q1a. Which  stand-alone  projects  within  the  Earth  Science  program  will  sustain  the

most drastic cuts?

A1a. This is not a subject with which I have sufficient knowledge to provide an ade-
quate answer.
Q1b. Do  you  believe  the  reorganization  of  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  is  a  good

idea or a bad idea? Why?

A1b. In some respects, this is a good idea because it recognizes in the organization
the  extremely  close  connection  between  solar  events  and  their  effects  on  Earth  sys-
tems.  For  example,  the  study  of  solar-generated  space  weather,  which  has  been  a
subject  of  increasing  scientific  interest  and  applied  concern  because  of  the  some-
times  severe  effects  of  space  weather  on  technological  systems,  such  as  airline
flights  and  the  electricity  grid,  could  be  affected  positively.  Further,  the  sun,
through  space  weather  effects  also  affects  terrestrial  weather.  However,  organizing
NASA  in  this  way  means  that  the  program  managers  must  give  careful  attention
to  coordination  of  the  different  aspects  of  the  program  to  assure  that  they  are  able
to achieve their overall objectives for the program.
Q1c. Would  you  have  any  recommendations  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of

NASA’s Earth Science program?

A1c. In my testimony, I noted the importance of following up NASA’s Earth Science
programs to document the scale and scope of the many benefits we derive from the
funds NASA spends on Earth science. In my view, the effectiveness of NASA’s Earth
Science  program  would  be  vastly  improved  through  a  sustained  effort  to  document
and measure the benefits of Earth science research, both the science results and the

applications developed in partnership with other U.S. agencies. As noted in my tes-
timony to this Committee, studies at the Space Policy Institute ‘‘show that the sup-
portable,  qualitative  benefits  of  Earth  science  research  are  quite  high  to  nearly  all
sectors  of  industry  and  to  the  public  sector.  Since  NASA  is  at  the  cutting  edge  of
Earth science research in this country, it should focus more attention on this impor-
tant  subject  in  order  to  assist  in  guiding  its  future  research  agenda.  This  is  not  to
say that expected practical benefits alone should determine NASA’s future research
agenda, since such an approach might stifle creative, breakthrough research efforts,
but such benefits should play a role in the decision process when difficult decisions
are being made among projects.’’

The Committee could assist NASA by ‘‘authoriz[ing] NASA to direct greater atten-
tion  to  the  quantification  of  the  benefits  of  Earth  science  research  and  applications
to  America’s  industry  and  public  sector,  and  the  policy  implications  of  those  bene-
fits.’’
