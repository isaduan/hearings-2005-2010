Background

4

The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  manages  a  number  of  different  programs  de-
signed to research and develop technologies to meet the goal of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions from our nation’s coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources.
The Department’s programs include the Clean Coal Power Initiative, FutureGen, In-
novations  for  Existing  Plants  Program,  the  Advanced  Turbines  Program,  the  Ad-
vanced  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  Program,  and  the  Carbon  Seques-
tration Regional Partnerships to name some of the specific programs that aim to im-
prove power plant efficiencies, advance the development of carbon capture and stor-
age technologies and reduce the costs of these technologies. In addition, the Depart-
ment  leads  U.S.  Government  participation  in  the  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership
Forum  that  was  established  in  2003  and  is  comprised  of  twenty-one  countries  and
the  European  Commission.  Its  goal  is  to  facilitate  the  development  of  cost-effective
technologies  and  strategies  for  CO2 separation,  capture  and  long-term  storage  and
to make these tools broadly available around the globe.

It is well known that approximately 50 percent of the electricity generation in the
United  States  comes  from  coal.  On  a  global  scale,  approximately  41  percent  of  the
electricity  production  is  from  coal.1 It  is  also  well  understood  that  the  burning  of
fossil  fuels  contributes  significantly  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  International
Energy Agency (IEA) 2008 report states, ‘‘The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere
is 385 ppm, and is rising by about two ppm per year.’’ 2 The IEA further states that
‘‘[S]tationary CO2 sources associated with fossil-fuel energy use produce the bulk of
the  world’s  CO2 emissions.’’  Specifically,  the  IEA  report  finds  that  electricity  and
heat production produced 9.6 Gt of CO2 in 2005 out of a total 26.3 Gt.3

As  we  move  to  adopt  policies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  United
States,  the  electricity  generating  sector  of  our  economy  certainly  will  be  one  target
to achieve those emissions reductions. While the details of a national climate change
program are unknown at this time, there is much discussion about the suite of prac-
tices  we  must  adopt  and  the  portfolio  of  technologies  we  must  deploy  to  meet  the
daunting  challenge  of  climate  change.  As  part  of  that  discussion  there  is  growing
interest  in  determining  how  significant  a  role  carbon  capture  and  storage  systems
can play in managing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

Carbon Capture

There  are  three  main  technology  options  for  capturing  CO2 from  power  plants  or
other  industrial  facilities:  1)  post-combustion  capture,  2)  pre-combustion  capture,
and 3) oxy-fuel combustion capture.

Post-combustion processes captures the CO2 from the exhaust gas through the use
of  distillation,  membranes,  or  absorption,  which  can  be  physical  or  chemical.  These
technologies  may  be  used  to  retrofit  existing  plants  or  incorporated  into  the  design
of  new  industrial  facilities  and  electricity  generating  plants.  There  are  some  out-
standing issues with these technologies that need to be addressed. One issue is the
loss of efficiency. Energy is required to operate these technologies, thus lowering the
overall power plant efficiency and increasing power generation costs. A second issue
is  the  energy  loss  associated  with  the  compression  of  the  CO2 after  it  is  captured
and  prepared  for  pipeline  transport.  There  are  commercially  available  technologies
that  perform  post-combustion  capture,  but  generally,  they  have  not  been  applied  to
large  volumes  of  flue-gas  streams  such  as  those  created  by  coal-fired  power  plants.
Pre-combustion  capture  first  reacts  the  fuel  with  oxygen  in  a  gasifier  to  create  a
syngas  consisting  of  carbon  monoxide  and  hydrogen—an  Integrated  Gasification
Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant is currently a requirement for the pre-combustion cap-
ture  of  CO2 for  electricity  generation.  The  syngas  is  cleaned  of  conventional  pollut-
ants (SO2, particulates) and sent to a shift reactor which uses steam and a catalyst
to produce CO2 and hydrogen. Then, a physical solvent can be used to separate out
the  CO2.  After  the  capture  process,  the  CO2 can  be  compressed  for  transportation
and long-term storage in geologic formations. The hydrogen is directed through gas
and  steam  cycles  to  produce  electricity.  While  construction  costs  for  an  IGCC  plant
are  higher  than  those  for  a  pulverized  coal  plant,  IGCC’s  operate  at  a  higher  effi-
ciency  and  the  penalty  for  the  carbon  capture  technology  is  considered  to  be  less.
There  are  currently  two  commercial  IGCC  plants  operating  in  the  United  States,
and  despite  the  potential  for  improved  environmental  performance  and  greater  fuel

efficiency  of  IGCC,  higher  costs  have  held  back  a  major  breakthrough  in  the  U.S.
market.

The oxy-fuel process feeds pure oxygen into the combustion process of the conven-
tional air-fired power plant. This type of technology aims to address CO2 during the
combustion  stage  by  increasing  the  CO2 concentration  of  the  flue  gas  exiting  the
boiler so that less energy is required to prepare the gas for storage. A main advan-
tage is that the lower the energy penalty, the lower the cost. However, the pure oxy-
gen generally would be provided by an air-separation unit which is energy intensive
to  operate  and  a  primary  source  of  reduced  efficiency.  There  is  ongoing  work  tar-
geted at improving the efficiency of this air-separation process. There are initiatives
in the United States to demonstrate this type of technology, but it has not yet been
tested in a large-scale facility.4

Carbon Storage

Following  the  compression  and  transportation  (if  needed)  of  the  captured  CO2,  it
would  be  injected  into  suitable  geological  formations  for  long-term  storage.  Cur-
rently,  the  most  promising  reservoirs  for  storing  CO2 are  oil  and  gas  fields,  deep
saline reservoirs and unmineable coal seams. The geologic formations best suited to
trap  large  volumes  of  CO2 and  do  so  without  leakage  would  have  characteristics
that  include  open  spaces  or  porosity,  sufficient  interconnectivity  between  the  open
spaces  so  that  CO2 can  flow  laterally  or  migrate  within  the  formations  (known  as
permeability)  and  a  layer  of  cap  rock  that  is  impermeable  to  prevent  the  upward
flow of CO2 keeping it underground.

The Department of Energy has made an assessment of the potential sequestration
capacity across the United States and parts of Canada and determined there exists
sufficient volume to store approximately 600 years of CO2 produced from total U.S.
fossil fuel emissions at current rates. The accuracy of this CO2 storage capacity esti-
mate  will  be  tested  and  updated  as  the  Department’s  seven  regional  sequestration
partnerships  continue  to  conduct  injection  tests  and  carry  out  large-scale  injection
experiments. For example, the tests conducted by the partnerships will help to con-
firm the efficiency of the available pore space and evaluate their assumptions about
the properties of the geologic formations.

Characterizing geologic reservoirs for the purposes of CO2 sequestration is an on-
going  research  effort  including  the  work  done  by  the  Department’s  sequestration
partnerships.  Information  derived  from  ongoing  research  and  demonstration  efforts
will provide information that would be used to guide site selection for full-scale CCS
operations  in  the  future.  This  is  particularly  important  for  non-oil  and  gas  sites,
such as deep saline reservoirs, which do not have the same level of engineering ex-
perience.

It is expected that the reservoir characterization process will rule out geologic for-
mations  that  are  risky  because  they  are  too  shallow,  inadequate  caprock  exists,  or
they  are  intersected  by  permeable  faults  and  fractures  and  therefore  provide  path-
ways  for  CO2 to  escape.  There  are  also  concerns  about  the  potential  impacts  of  in-
jected CO2 on aquifers used for drinking water or as supplies for agriculture.

There  are  no  federal  regulations  governing  the  injection  and  storage  of  CO2 for
the  purposes  of  carbon  sequestration.  However,  in  July  2008,  the  U.S.  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  released  a  draft  rule  that  would  regulate  CO2 injection
for sequestration purposes under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, Un-
derground Injection Control (UIC) program. Final regulations are anticipated in the
2010/2011 timeframe.

The  terms  measurement,  monitoring  and  verification  (MMV)  are  frequently  used
to describe the plan and tools for characterizing the subsurface reservoir and for de-
tecting  changes  throughout  the  injection,  closure,  and  long-term  oversight  of  a  geo-
logic  storage  project.  Because  the  geology  varies  from  site  to  site,  there  is  no  uni-
versal  agreement  on  the  specific  elements  that  should  be  included  in  MMV  for  all
large-scale geologic sequestration projects.

FutureGen:

In  2003,  President  Bush  and  the  Department  of  Energy  announced  their
FutureGen initiative. FutureGen was described as the first zero-emission, coal-fired
electricity-generating  plant  that  would  also  produce  hydrogen.  FutureGen  was  a
major  technology  initiative  to  address  climate  change  and  to  support  the  Adminis-
tration’s hydrogen fuel initiative.

Under the FutureGen program, DOE would oversee a consortium of industrial in-
terests (the FutureGen Alliance) and international partners that would manage the
construction  of  a  $1  billion  next-generation  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle
(IGCC)  power  plant  to  produce  electricity  and  hydrogen.  There  were  three  main
components  to  the  original  FutureGen  program.  It  would  be  a  state-of-the-art  dem-
onstration of a 275 megawatt IGCC power plant designed to capture, compress and
store  carbon  dioxide,  emit  virtually  no  conventional  air  pollutants,  and  produce  hy-
drogen fuel. FutureGen was also intended as the United State’s major collaborative
effort  with  international  partners  (India,  Korea,  etc.)  to  demonstrate  an  integrated
CCS  system  using  advanced  gasification  technology.  Finally,  FutureGen  was  to
serve  as  a  living  laboratory  to  test  advanced  coal  technologies  in  order  to  achieve
operational  efficiencies  and  speed  deployment  of  CCS  technologies.  Between  FY
2003  and  FY  2008,  Congress  appropriated  approximately  $174  million  for  the
FutureGen Initiative.

On January 30, 2008, the Department of Energy announced a major restructuring
of  the  FutureGen  program.  Rather  than  build  a  275-megawatt  IGCC  power  plant
to test CCS technologies and provide for the demonstration of an integrated carbon
capture  and  sequestration  system,  the  Department  would  support  the  private  sec-
tor’s  investment  in  IGCC  power  plants  by  providing  the  additional  funding  needed
to  add  CCS  technologies  to  the  construction  of  multiple  commercial  power  plants
being  pursued  by  industry.  Although,  initially  the  restructured  FutureGen  focused
on IGCC facilities, the final Funding Opportunity Announcement included other ad-
vanced  coal  power  plants.  It  is  important  to  note,  that  the  restructured  program
eliminates  the  hydrogen  production  and  the  living  laboratory  components  of  the
original program.

Since the announcement to restructure FutureGen, DOE issued a Funding Oppor-
tunity  Announcement  for  the  restructured  program  in  June  2008.  The  Department
has  received  a  handful  of  proposals  and  those  proposals  are  under  review.  In  addi-
tion, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 includes $3.4 bil-
lion  for  fossil  energy  research  and  development  and  some  of  these  funds  could  be
used  for  FutureGen.  Recently,  Secretary  Chu  testified  in  the  Senate  Energy  and
Natural Resources Committee that he would support the plant with ‘‘some modifica-
tions.’’ 5 In  response  to  the  ARRA,  DOE  is  planning  to  issue  four  Funding  Oppor-
tunity  Announcements  for  improving  techniques  to  clean  or  capture  and  store  the
emissions  from  coal-fired  electric  generating  plants  and  other  industrial  sources.  It
is still unclear if those funds will be used for FutureGen and what, if any, modifica-
tions will be made to the FutureGen program going forward.

International Activities:

China  is  the  world’s  largest  coal  user,  accounting  for  63  percent  of  the  country’s
total primary energy supply.6 India is the world’s third-largest coal user accounting
for  62  percent  of  the  country’s  energy  supply  and  its  use  is  expected  to  grow  rap-
idly.7 As stated above, the United States relies on coal for approximately 50 percent
of  its  electricity  production.  Climate  change  is  a  global  problem  and  major  world
economies  see  a  growing  need  to  work  collaboratively  to  develop  and  deploy  ad-
vanced coal technologies.

This past summer at the G–8 Summit in Japan, the G–8 leaders asked the Inter-
national  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  to  develop  an  energy  roadmap  for  CCS  technologies.
The  IEA  intends  to  build  the  roadmap  based  on  workshops  convened  in  2006–2007
by  the  IEA  and  the  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum  (CSLF).  The  roadmap
will  make  recommendations  for  the  G–8  in  policy  areas  including  financial,  legal
and  international  cooperation  endeavors  to  help  expand  the  deployment  of  CCS
strategies. The G–8 Ministers also issued a joint-statement supporting the IEA and
CSLF’s  recommendation  to  launch  20  large-scale  CCS  projects  globally.  Australia
has  taken  steps  to  create  a  Global  Carbon  Capture  and  Storage  Institute  to  assess
CCS  and  facilitate  international  research  collaboration  covering  a  range  of  tech-
nologies and geologies. The European Technology Platform for Zero Emission Fossil
Fuel  Power  Plants  (ZEP)  was  founded  in  2005  to  ensure  CCS  is  commercialized  by
2020.  In  2004,  the  China  Huaneng  Group  led  the  development  of  the  GreenGen
project to build an IGCC plant with CCS. While pieces of an integrated CCS system
are  being  demonstrated  at  various  scales  throughout  the  world,  no  large-scale  inte-

Chair  BAIRD.  Good  morning,  everyone  and  thank  you  for  being
here. Our hearing will now come to order. I want to welcome every-
body  to  the  Energy  and  Environment  Subcommittee’s  hearing  on
‘‘FutureGen  and  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Advanced  Coal  Pro-
grams.’’  I  would  like  to  thank  our  expert  panel  of  witnesses  for
being  here  today,  and  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony  about  the
potential  role  advanced  coal  technologies,  including  carbon  capture
and  storage,  may  play  in  helping  to  solve  the  daunting  challenge
of climate change and ocean acidification.

We  burn  a  lot  of  coal  in  this  country  and  around  the  world.  The
United  States  is  one  of  the  largest  consumers  of  coal,  and  this  is
one of the major reasons we are one of the largest emitters of ocean
acidification and overheated gases. But we are not the only country
with  strong  dependence  on  coal.  China  and  India  have  both  ex-
panded  their  coal  use.  I  was  in  China  just  a  couple  of  years  ago
and  was  told  they  are  putting  on  coal-powered  plants  every  couple
of weeks, gradually comes on line. It is astonishing, really. In 2007
China surpassed us to become the largest contributor to global CO2
emissions.  I  do  not  say  this  to  point  fingers,  but  to  point  out  that
overheating and ocean acidification truly are a global problem, and
we  must  work  with  other  developed  nations  and  developing  econo-
mies to find solutions to those staggering challenges.

I  think  the  United  States  should  take  the  lead  in  reducing  en-
ergy  consumption  and  particularly  consumption  of  fossil  fuels.  We
have  a  variety  of  tools  at  our  disposal  to  accomplish  that  goal.  We
can  develop  and  deploy  advanced,  green  technologies,  adopt  better
conservation  practices  and  energy  efficiency  policies,  and  as  indi-
viduals, we can behave more responsibly. Without bold policies and
public  and  personal  commitment,  we  run  the  risk  of  serious  dam-
age to our environment and our society. That outcome is simply un-
acceptable.

If  41  percent  of  our  global  electricity  supply  comes  from  burning
coal,  then  it  is  imperative  that  we  curtail  the  gas  emissions  from
this  major  source.  We  must  act  now  to  do  so.  I  recognize  that  ap-
proximately  50  percent  of  the  power  supply  in  the  United  States
comes from coal-fired plants, so we can’t expect to tackle this chal-
lenge overnight. But it is my sincere hope and expectation that we
can  devise  a  strategy  forward  that  achieves  the  remarkable  reduc-
tion  in  greenhouse  gaseous  emissions  in  a  safe,  responsible  and
sustainable manner.

Today’s hearing provides us with an excellent opportunity to dis-
cuss our overall strategy to reduce emissions from large stationary
sources,  such  as  electric  generation  plants.  I  think  there  are  some
lessons  we  can  learn  from  the  decisions  about  the  FutureGen  pro-
gram,  and  I  am  hopeful  that  we  can  have  a  very  honest  conversa-
tion  today  about  the  near-term  and  long-term  objectives  and  chal-
lenges for the Department of Energy’s advanced coal programs.

Finally, I am pleased that this hearing will include an important
dialogue  about  international  collaboration  on  strategies  for  imple-
menting  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.  As  I  said,  global  over-
heating  and  ocean  acidification  is  a  global  problem  and  it  requires
a global solution.

Again,  I  thank  the  panel  for  being  here  this  morning  and  I  look

forward to your testimony and an interesting discussion.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR BRIAN BAIRD

Good morning. I would like to welcome everybody to the Energy and Environment
Subcommittee’s  hearing  on  ‘‘FutureGen  and  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Advanced
Coal  Programs.’’  I  would  like  to  thank  our  expert  panel  of  witnesses  for  being  here
today  and  I  look  forward  to  your  testimony  about  the  potential  role  advanced  coal

Again,  I  thank  the  panel  for  being  here  this  morning  and  I  look  forward  to  your

testimony and an interesting discussion.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  holding
this  hearing.  You  know,  in  South  Carolina  we  have  a  case  study
of  one  of  the  cases  with  respect  to  coal,  and  that  is  that  Duke  En-
ergy would like to build a nuclear power plant or two but the ques-
tion  is  whether  you  can  do  that  effectively  or  whether  it  is  really
just easier and cheaper to build coal plants. We are not so depend-
ent  on  the  jobs  associated  with  coal.  There  are  some  parts  of  our
country that are, but we are the users, we are the people that burn
coal because it is a pretty cheap way to make electricity, especially
if  you  have  no  accountability  for  what  is  coming  out  of  the  smoke-
stack. And so the question, then, is whether something can be done
to clean up that coal to—we have had a number of hearings in this
committee about sequestration, that sort of thing, because we know
we can burn it cleanly, and General Electric has a number of prov-
en models that show that you can basically separate out the hydro-
gen  and  burn  that,  and  that  is  pretty  exciting.  Still,  you  have  still
got the CO2 issue.

So the question is whether we can figure out a way to really im-
prove  that  process  or  have  some  sort  of  breakthrough  that  would
make it possible to continue that employment in some places in the
country  that  are  dependent  on  coal  and  somehow  control  the  CO2
problem.

That is certainly our hope in this FutureGen program, and so we
look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses  about  what  the  future
may be. And it is interesting to note that folks like Duke Engineer-
ing  are  not  alone.  We  use  lots  of  coal,  and  figuring  out  ways  to
make  it  cleaner  and  to  collect  up  the  CO2 would  be  an  incredible
breakthrough.

So we look forward to hearing from the witnesses, Mr. Chairman,
and  hope  that  there  is  some  way  to  break  through  to  truly  clean
coal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman.
Duke  Energy  faces  a  dilemma  in  South  Carolina.  They  would  like  to  produce  en-
ergy free of CO2 emissions and help bring the energy solutions of tomorrow to their
customers  today.  The  licensing  and  cost  hurdles  of  nuclear,  wind,  and  solar  power
have  forced  Duke  instead  to  meet  increased  energy  demand  by  building  coal-pow-
ered plants.

Duke  Energy  is  not  alone.  We’re  using  lots  of  coal.  We  need  to  focus  on  ways  to
make that consumption cleaner and more efficient. Perhaps if we had clean coal and
carbon  capture  technologies  readily  available  and  affordable,  companies  like  Duke
would be able to meet growing energy demand with coal and without emissions.

We  need  these  technologies  to  be  affordable  and  attractive  to  U.S.  and  global  in-
dustry  alike.  America  can  lead  the  way  with  technological  innovation  that  can  be
easily integrated into existing coal plants worldwide.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  decision  to  restructure  the  FutureGen  program  in
2008 compromised some important components of clean coal research. We had hoped
for  the  production  and  capture  of  hydrogen  fuel.  We  had  hoped  for  a  laboratory  to
test  new  technologies.  I’m  interested  in  hearing  how  DOE  plans  to  reevaluate  the
role  of  the  FutureGen  program  in  meeting  our  clean  coal  and  carbon  capture  and
sequestration objectives.

But  with  or  without  FutureGen,  Congress  is  aggressively  seeking  an  answer  to
our  carbon  emissions  problem.  I  believe  the  best  way  to  do  this  is  to  attach  a
straightforward price to carbon emissions and reduce payroll taxes in an equal and
offsetting amount. By forcing the market to internalize the externals associated with
burning  fossil  fuels,  we  can  encourage  cutting  edge  innovation  in  energy  tech-
nologies  and  help  America  be  a  leader  in  finding  the  energy  solutions  of  tomorrow.
Thank  you  again  for  holding  this  hearing,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  look  forward  to

hearing from our witnesses.

Chair  BAIRD.  I  would  like  to  at  this  point  recognize  the  gen-
tleman, Mr. Costello, who has been a very, very influential and in-
terested party on this issue, and Mr. Costello, we welcome your re-
marks.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  And  I  have  a  state-
ment  that  I  will  enter  into  the  record  and  make  some  brief  com-
ments concerning the GAO report and the purpose of this hearing.
But first, let me not only thank you for recognizing me but also for
calling this hearing today, and thank you as well for joining Chair-
man Gordon and Mr. Lipinski and I in requesting this GAO report.
As you noted, I guess it has been over five years now that I have
been  involved  with  this  project,  and  in  fact  as  I  think  everyone
knows  that  over  one  half  of  our  electricity  is  generated  from  coal.
Coal  is  the  cheapest  form  of  electricity  generation,  and  we  have

coal  reserves  just  in  my  home  State  of  Illinois  alone  that  contains
more BTU’s than oil reserves in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Like  everyone,  I  want  our  nation’s  energy  policy  to  help  reduce
carbon  emissions  and  to  address  the  climate  change  issue  that  we
are all facing, but in order to meet these goals, our dependence on
coal  requires  significant  investment  in  clean  technologies  to  burn
coal as efficiently and as cleanly as possible. The reality is that our
dependence on coal as an energy source is not going away any time
soon,  and  as  you  noted  in  your  opening  statement,  we  are  not  the
only  nation  that  is  reliant  on  coal  as  an  energy  source.  China,  as
you  said,  they  are  actually  constructing  one  coal-fired  plant  every
week now in China. When we develop clean-coal technology here in
this country, countries like China, India and other countries will in
fact hopefully use that technology to achieve our goal.

I  want  to  say  that  when  the  President  announced  in  the  State
of  the  Union  Address  in  2003,  President  Bush,  this  was  his  initia-
tive,  the  FutureGen  project.  I  was  excited  about  it  to  the  extent
that  after  listening  to  the  State  of  the  Union  Address,  the  next
morning  I  picked  up  the  telephone  and  called  the  Secretary  of  En-
ergy and said I am a supporter of this project. I want to move for-
ward.  We  want  to  do  everything  we  can  to  help  move  the  project
forward. So you can imagine how disappointed I was, not only dis-
appointed but outraged, after five and a half years of research and
spending literally tens of millions of dollars on this project, that the
Department  of  Energy  and  the  Administration  decided  to  pull  the
plug on the project.

We  in  this  subcommittee  heard  testimony  from  the  representa-
tives  from  the  Department  of  Energy  as  to  why  the  decision  was
made.  They  said  basically  that  the  reason  that  the  project  was
going  to  be  pulled  and  reassessed  and  realigned  was  because  of
cost,  the  escalating  cost.  We  questioned  that  at  the  time  and,  you
know, obviously today, with the GAO findings and we will get into
that and there are some quotes that I will put into the record very
shortly,  it  was  not  cost.  I  said  here  sitting  in  this  subcommittee
room that I believed at the time that it was based on politics, that
we  had  four  sites  that  were  the  finalists,  two  in  Texas  and  two  in
the  State  of  Illinois,  and  when  the  alliance,  the  independent  alli-
ance  that  was  appointed  not  only  for  their  expertise  on  this  issue
but  also  to  remove  politics  and  to  have  independence  from  a  polit-
ical decision but to base decisions on the science and what was best
for the country, they examined all four sites and came up with the
site  in  Mattoon,  Illinois,  and  said  that  the  Mattoon  site  was  the
best site, and it was then that the Administration decided, well, we
are going to pull back on the project and pull the plug. So we know
today  that  the  GAO  report  says  that  it  was  not  based  upon  costs,
and  of  course,  they  don’t  go  into  what  the  decision  was  based  on,
but I think that through the process of elimination, we know what
it was based on.

My goal is to get the project back on track. My goal is to not only
move  FutureGen  and  sequestration  forward  but  also  to  look  at
other  clean-coal  technologies  so  that  we  in  fact  can  begin  to  burn
coal as cleanly and efficiently as possible.

So  Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I  thank  you  for  calling  the  hearing
today. I look forward to hearing the testimony of our witnesses and
look forward to moving this project forward.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  calling  today’s  hearing  on  the  FutureGen  project.
The  FutureGen  project  has  been  one  that  I  have  worked  on  very  closely  over  the
past  five  and  a  half  years  and  I  am  interested  in  hearing  from  GAO  and  our  other
witnesses on this issue.

Mr. Chairman, we generate over one-half of our electricity from coal and the coal
reserves  in  my  home  State  of  Illinois  contain  more  Btu’s  than  the  oil  reserves  of
Saudi  Arabia  and  Kuwait.  Like  many,  I  want  our  nation’s  energy  policy  to  help  re-
duce  carbon  emissions  and  adequately  address  the  real  concerns  of  climate  change.
In  order  to  meet  these  goals,  our  dependence  on  coal  requires  a  significant  invest-
ment in clean technologies to reliably burn coal as efficiently and as cleanly as pos-
sible.  The  reality  is  that  our  dependence  on  coal  as  an  energy  source  is  not  going
away.  We  are  not  alone  in  our  reliance  on  this  energy  source;  to  satisfy  its  rapidly
growing  population  and  economy,  China  is  adding  one  new  coal-fired  plant  to  its
power grid each week.

For  these  reasons,  the  day  after  the  President  announced  the  FutureGen  Clean
Coal Initiative in his 2003 State of the Union address, I was on the phone with the
Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  working  to  get  the  project  off  the  ground.  After  five
years of work with DOE, with the FutureGen Alliance, the State of Illinois and oth-
ers,  I  was  extremely  disappointed  that  DOE  decided  to  scrap  the  project  in  favor
of a ‘‘re-scoped’’ plan. I was pleased to join Chairman Gordon, Chairman Baird, and
Mr.  Lipinski  in  requesting  GAO  to  further  examine  the  reasoning  behind  the  deci-
sion to abandon the original project.

I  have  stated  previously  during  Science  Committee  hearings  that  I  did  not  find
DOE’s justifications for canceling FutureGen to be based on accurate information or
factual  analysis.  GAO’s  final  report  affirms  what  we  thought  from  the  beginning:
to  quote  directly  from  the  report,  ‘‘DOE  did  not  base  its  decision  to  restructure
FutureGen on a comprehensive analysis of factors, such as the associated costs, ben-
efits  and  risks  . . .  [consequently]  DOE  has  no  assurance  that  the  restructured
FutureGen is the best option to advance CCS.’’

As a supporter of clean coal technology, I am focused on getting this project back
on  track.  DOE’s  decision  has  already  meant  wasted  time,  and  has  delayed  the
project for over a year at a time when the need for public investment in clean, effi-
cient energy technologies could not be more evident. Despite DOE’s decision to back
away  from  its  agreement  with  the  FutureGen  Alliance,  an  international  non-profit
consortium  of  some  of  the  largest  coal  producers  and  users  in  the  world,  the  group
did  not  dissolve,  but  in  fact  continued  its  commitment  to  the  project  by  purchasing
the land for the plant in Mattoon, Illinois. With the legal and environmental issues
surrounding  this  project  already  resolved  and  its  investors  still  committed,
FutureGen  is  as  shovel-ready  as  any  other  clean  coal  project  in  the  country.  It  is
my hope that with new leadership and new analysis, the FutureGen project can re-
alize its full potential to become world’s first coal-fueled, near-zero emissions power
plant.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  distinguished

panel of witnesses.

Chair BAIRD. I thank you, Mr. Costello, and thanks for your lead-

ership on this very issue for so many years now.

If  there  are  other  Members  who  wish  to  submit  opening  state-

ments, your statement will be added to the record at this point.

And  now  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  witnesses.  Our  first  wit-
ness  is  Dr.  Victor  Der.  Dr.  Der  is  the  Acting  Assistant  Secretary
for  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Fossil  Energy.  I  want  to
briefly note, Dr. Der, I appreciate very much your work with a com-
pany  in  Washington  State  that  has  developed  leading-edge  tech-
nology  on  compression  of  gases  which  will  be  absolutely  essential
to success at some point if we move forward with this, and it is al-
ways nice when you hear from local constituents who say they have

worked  well  with  a  government  entity  that  has  been  very,  very
helpful, and thank you for your work on that.

Mr.  Mark  Gaffigan  is  the  Director  of  the  Natural  Resources  and
Environment  Team  at  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office
involved in preparing some of the reports that Mr. Costello alluded
to.  Dr.  Robert  Finley  is  the  Director  of  the  Energy  and  Earth  Re-
sources  Center  at  the  Illinois  State  Geological  Survey.  Dr.  Finley,
thank you for being here. Mr. Larry Monroe is the Senior Research
Consultant  at  Southern  Company,  and  Ms.  Sarah  Forbes  is  the
Senior  Associate  of  the  Climate  and  Energy  Program  at  the  World
Resource Institute.

As  our  witnesses  all  know,  you  will  have  five  minutes  for  your
spoken  testimony,  then  written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the
record  for  the  hearing.  When  each  of  you  has  concluded  your  com-

bipartisan,  friendly  committee  that  asks  tough  questions,  but  in
the  way  of  trying  to  understand  difficult  and  challenging  issues.
And with that, let us start with Dr. Der.
STATEMENT  OF  DR.  VICTOR  K.  DER,  ACTING  ASSISTANT  SEC-
RETARY,  OFFICE  OF  FOSSIL  ENERGY,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF
ENERGY
Dr. DER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this opportunity
to discuss the Department of Energy’s advanced coal program with
the keen focus on safe, effective and affordable carbon capture and
storage.

Coal  represents  a  tremendous  and  strategic  national  asset  with
enough  supply  to  take  us  well  into  the  next  century  based  on  the
current  rates  of  consumption,  and  as  we  explore  energy  alter-
natives,  coal  used  in  environmentally  sustainable  and  responsible
ways  will  continue  to  play  a  critical  role  in  the  Nation’s  energy
strategy.  Our  focus  must  be,  therefore,  to  develop  deployable  ad-
vanced  technologies  necessary  to  achieve  near-zero  emissions  from
coal use, including carbon capture and storage, or CCS, not just in
the  United  States,  but  in  developing  economies  such  as  China  and
India which will continue to rely on coal. Thus, CCS is an essential
component of the global greenhouse gas mitigation strategy.

DOE  remains  a  leader  in  the  development  of  advanced  tech-
nologies  that  have  helped  reduce  pollutant  emissions  and  have  in-
creased power plan efficiency. These technological successes form a
solid  foundation  upon  which  to  build  advances  and  innovations
needed to meet the challenges of CO2 reductions.

The  advanced  coal  program  is  geared  toward  developing  a  port-
folio  of  revolutionary  technologies  for  CCS.  To  that  end,  and  in
partnership  with  the  private  sector,  the  program  is  focused  on
three  important  areas:  technologies  for  affordable  CO2 capture,  es-
pecially  back-end  stack  capture;  establishing  the  scientific  and
technical  basis  for  safe  and  effective  storage  of  CO2;  and  substan-
tially  improving  the  efficiency  and  reliability  of  fossil  energy  sys-
tems.  All  three  of  these  areas  are  important  as  we  work  to  make
CCS technologies deployable and cost effective.

We have a good start in this direction based on years of research
and  demonstration  experience  that  have  resulted  in  new  concepts,
including  the  conversion  of  coal  into  cleaner,  versatile  gases  that

can  be  used  to  generate  power  or  produce  fuels.  Additionally,  our
research  continues  to  explore  emerging  approaches  to  clean  power
generation  that  hold  great  promise  for  integration  with  coal-based
or combined coal and biomass energy plants with CCS. To this end,
we  are  working  on  CCS  enabling  and  transformational  tech-
nologies, including advanced integrated gasification combined cycle,
advanced hydrogen turbines, advanced materials for ultra high-effi-
ciency  plants,  supersonic  compression,  and  revolutionary  concepts
for CO2 capture.

The success of our programs will ultimately be judged by the ex-
tent to which emerging and cost-effective technologies are deployed
domestically  and  internationally.  That  is  why  DOE  is  imple-
menting  large  large-scale  CCS  demonstration  efforts  under  the  se-
questration  partnerships  and  the  clean  coal  power  initiative  pro-
grams.  And  that  is  why  we  have  taken  a  lead  role  in  global  part-
nerships  like  the  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum,  the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, the International Energy Agen-
cy,  and  bilateral  collaboration  with  countries  such  as  Canada,
India, and China and other international initiatives.

Mr.  Chairman,  today  nearly  75  percent  of  the  coal  power  plants
in  the  United  States  employ  technologies  with  roots  in  DOE’s  pro-
gram  for  advanced  coal.  With  continued  leadership  and  support
from the Administration and Congress, we can accelerate the devel-
opment of new technologies to meet the requirements of a safe and
secure energy future while reducing our carbon footprint.

Again,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify
here  today,  and  with  that,  I  will  welcome  any  questions  that  the
Committee may have.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Der follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VICTOR K. DER

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  appreciate  this  op-
portunity  to  provide  testimony  on  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE’s)  ad-
vanced  coal  research,  development,  and  demonstration  program  to  develop  low-car-
bon emission coal technologies.

INTRODUCTION

Fossil fuel resources represent a tremendous national asset. An abundance of fos-
sil  fuels  in  North  America  has  contributed  to  our  nation’s  economic  prosperity.
Based upon current rates of consumption, the United States probably has sufficient
coal  to  meet  its  need  for  the  next  century.  Making  use  of  this  domestic  asset  in  a
responsible  manner  will  help  the  United  States  to  meet  its  energy  requirements,
minimize detrimental environmental impacts, positively contribute to national secu-
rity, and compete in the global marketplace.

Fossil  fuels  will  play  a  critical  role  in  our  nation’s  future  energy  strategy.  By  de-
veloping technologies to mitigate the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmos-
phere,  we  can  continue  to  use  our  extensive  domestic  coal  resource  while  reducing
the  impacts  on  climate  viable  energy  source  for  our  nation.  CCS  is  the  primary
pathway  DOE  is  pursuing  to  allow  continued  use  of  fossil  fuels  in  a  carbon-con-
strained future.

Through  fossil  energy  provisions  in  the  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act
and  annual  appropriations,  DOE’s  advanced  coal  program  is  working  to  accelerate
the development of CCS to meet future energy needs.

The  remainder  of  my  testimony  will  highlight  CCS  activities  that  are  underway

in the advanced coal program.

NEAR-ZERO EMISSIONS PROGRAM

DOE provides a national leadership role in the development of advanced coal tech-
nologies.  DOE’s  advanced  coal  program  has  returned  substantial  benefits  to  con-

sumers and taxpayers across a broad range of innovative technologies that are now
in  use  throughout  the  world.  For  example,  DOE  and  the  private  sector  responded
to the challenge of dramatically reducing the emissions of particulate, sulfur, nitro-
gen  oxide,  and  mercury  from  coal-based  energy  systems  with  the  development  of
technologies  that  enable  coal-based  power  plants  to  meet  environmental  controls
and limits placed on these pollutants. These technological innovations have resulted
in  significant  environmental  benefits:  reducing  pollutant  emissions,  reducing  water
use,  minimizing  wastewater  discharge,  and  reducing  solid  wastes.  DOE  research
and demonstration capabilities are well suited to address new challenges associated
with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as a climate change mitigation strat-
egy.

The  advanced  coal  program—administered  by  DOE’s  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  and
implemented by the National Energy Technology Laboratory—is designed to address
climate  concerns  of  coal  usage  by  developing  a  portfolio  of  revolutionary  advanced
carbon capture and efficiency and performance, while minimizing the costs of these
new  technologies.  In  recent  years,  the  Program  has  been  restructured  to  focus  on
CCS. The Program pursues the following two major strategies:

1) capturing carbon dioxide; and
2) storing it in geologic formations.

Capturing  and  storing  carbon  dioxide  and  improving  the  fuel-to-energy  efficiency
of  CCS  will  help  address  pollutant  emissions  reduction,  water  usage,  and  carbon
emissions  on  a  per  unit  of  electricity  basis.  These  plans  strive  to  achieve  dramatic
reductions in emissions and ensure that current and future fossil energy plants will
meet all emerging requirements for a safe and secure energy future.

Coal  research  has  resulted  in  important  insights  regarding  future  innovations.
New  engineering  concepts  have  been  developed  to  convert  coal  into  gases  that  can
be  cleaned  and  then  used  to  generate  power  or  produce  fuels.  New  approaches  to
clean  power  generation  are  emerging  that  hold  promise  for  integration  with  coal-
based  or  combined  coal  and  biomass  energy  plants.  Technologies  for  achieving  CCS
are  stretching  beyond  basic  research,  defining  pathways  in  which  greenhouse  gas
emissions  can  be  permanently  diverted  from  the  atmosphere.  With  these  building
blocks, a new breed of coal plant can be created—one that generates power and pro-
duces high-value energy with much less environmental impact. DOE’s work includes
a  focus  on  high  priority  CCS  enabling  technologies,  such  as  advanced  integrated
gasification  combined  cycle,  advanced  hydrogen  turbines,  carbon  capture,  and  fuel
cells.  These  research  areas  provide  the  supporting  technology  base  for  all  CCS  de-
velopment.

As part of our advanced coal program, we are addressing the key technology chal-
lenges  that  confront  the  wide-scale  deployment  of  CCS  through  research  on  cost-ef-
fective capture technologies; monitoring, verification, and accounting technologies to
ensure  permanent  storage;  permitting  issues;  liability  issues;  public  outreach;  and
infrastructure  needs.  As  an  example,  today’s  commercially  available  CCS  tech-
nologies  will  add  around  80  percent  to  the  cost  of  electricity  for  a  new  pulverized
coal plant, and around 35 percent to the cost of electricity for a new advanced gasifi-
cation-based  plant.1 The  program  is  aggressively  pursuing  developments  to  reduce
these costs to less than a 10 percent increase in the cost of electricity for new gasifi-
cation-based  energy  plants,  and  less  than  a  30  percent  increase  in  the  cost  of  elec-
tricity for pulverized coal energy plants.2

The  existing  research  program  has  been  performing  CCS  field  tests  for  many
years,  where  the  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Partnerships  are  drilling  wells  in
potential  storage  locations  and  injecting  small  quantities  of  CO2 to  validate  the  po-
tential of key storage locations throughout the country. Substantial progress has oc-
curred  in  the  area  of  monitoring,  verification,  and  accounting  of  CO2 storage  with
the  development  and  refinement  of  technologies  to  better  understand  storage  sta-
bility, permanence, and the characteristics of CO2 migration.

Research is also focused on developing technology options that dramatically lower
the  cost  of  capturing  CO2 from  fossil  fuel  energy  plants.  This  research  can  be  cat-
egorized into three pathways: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion.
Post-combustion  refers  to  capturing  CO2 from  the  stack  gas  after  a  fuel  has  been
combusted  in  air.  Pre-combustion  refers  to  a  process  where  a  hydrocarbon  fuel  is
gasified to form a synthetic mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and CO2 is cap-
tured from the synthesis gas before it is combusted. Oxy-combustion is an approach

where  a  hydrocarbon  fuel  is  combusted  in  pure  or  nearly  pure  oxygen  rather  than
air,  which  produces  a  mixture  of  CO2 and  water  that  can  easily  be  separated  to
produce  pure  CO2.  This  research  is  exploring  a  wide  range  of  approaches:  mem-
branes;  oxy-combustion  concepts;  solid  sorbents;  CO2 hydrates;  and  advanced  gas/
liquid  scrubbing  technologies.  These  efforts  cover  not  only  improvements  to  state-
of-the-art  technologies  but  also  development  of  several  revolutionary  concepts,  such
as  metal  organic  frameworks,  ionic  liquids,  and  enzyme-based  systems,  in  conjunc-
tion  with  basic  research  in  these  areas  now  being  conducted  by  the  DOE’s  Office
of Science.

A  central  piece  of  our  CCS  research  is  DOE’s  field  test  program,  which  is  being
implemented  through  the  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Partnerships.  DOE’s  field
test program reflects the geographic differences in fossil fuel use and potential stor-
age sites across the United States and targets the use of regional approaches in ad-
dressing  CCS.  It  encompasses  approximately  97  percent  of  coal-fired  and  industrial
CO2 emissions, about 96 percent of the total land mass, and essentially all the geo-
logic storage sites in the country that can potentially be available for carbon seques-
tration. The field tests are conducted through partnerships comprised of State agen-
cies, universities, and private companies, with the goal of developing the knowledge
base  and  infrastructure  for  the  wide-scale  deployment  of  CCS  technologies.  The
seven Regional Partnerships represent more than 350 unique organizations in forty-
two  States,  three  Indian  Nations,  and  four  Canadian  Provinces.  It  is  important  to
note  that  the  non-federal  cost  share  for  the  field  test  program  is  greater  than  35
percent, which is a key indicator of industry and other partner interest the country
with similar characteristics relating to CCS opportunities.

DOE  is  addressing  key  infrastructure  issues  related  to  permitting,  pore  space
ownership,  site  access,  liability,  public  outreach,  and  education.  DOE  works  closely
with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others in developing CCS reg-
ulation  strategies,  which  will  provide  additional  certainty  for  future  CCS  deploy-
ments.

Over  the  course  of  these  research  initiatives,  DOE  will  jointly  develop  Best  Prac-
tice  Manuals  on  topics  such  as  site  characterization,  site  construction,  operations,
monitoring,  mitigation,  closure,  and  long-term  stewardship.  These  Manuals,  which
will be developed in conjunction with DOE’s Office of Science and the U.S. Geologi-
cal  Survey,  will  serve  as  guidelines  for  a  future  geologic  sequestration  industry  in
their regions, and help transfer the lessons to all regional stakeholders.

LARGE-SCALE DEMONSTRATION AT COMMERCIAL SCALE

The  success  of  our  research  on  CCS  and  advanced  coal  technologies  will  ulti-
mately  be  judged  by  the  extent  to  which  emerging  technologies  are  deployed  in  do-
mestic and international marketplaces. Both technical and financial challenges asso-
ciated  with  the  deployment  of  new  integrated  CCS  technologies  must  be  overcome
in  order  to  be  capable  of  achieving  success  in  the  marketplace.  Commercial-scale
demonstrations  help  the  industry  understand  and  overcome  start-up  issues,  compo-
nent  integration  issues,  and  gain  the  early  learning  commercial  experience  nec-
essary to reduce risk and secure private financing and investment for future plants.
DOE is implementing large-scale programs such as the geologic storage field tests
and  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  (CCPI).  Phase  III  of  the  geologic  storage  field
test program is focused on large-scale field tests of geologic carbon sequestration on
the order of one million infrastructure needs of these projects. CCPI is primarily fo-
cused on component testing at commercial scale. The CCPI Round 3 Funding Oppor-
tunity  Announcement  (FOA)  specifically  targets  advanced  coal-based  systems  and
subsystems that capture or separate CO2 for sequestration or for beneficial use.

THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT

The  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act  (Recovery  Act)  appropriates
$3,400,000,000  for  ‘‘Fossil  Energy  Research  and  Development.’’  As  reflected  in  the
Joint  Explanatory  Statement  of  the  Committee  of  Conference  leading  to  the  Act,
these  Recovery  Act  funds  will  help  fund  activities  targeted  at  expanding  and  accel-
erating the commercial deployment of CCS technology to provide a key thrust to the
advanced coal program to accelerate, by many years, the advances needed for future
plants with CCS.

The  Joint  Explanatory  Statement  of  the  Recovery  Act  identifies  the  following
major  initiatives  that  will  complement  and  accelerate  efforts  in  the  advanced  coal
program:

Maintain Fossil Energy R&D Program: $1  billion  to  be  used  to  conduct  fossil

energy research and development.

17

Additional Funds for the CCPI Round 3 FOA: $800 million to be used to aug-

ment funding for the CCPI Round 3 competition.

New  CCS  Initiative  for  Industrial  Applications:  $1.52  billion  to  be  used  for
a  competitive  solicitation  for  a  range  of  industrial  carbon  capture  and  energy  effi-
ciency improvement projects, including a small allocation for innovative concepts for
beneficial CO2 reuse.

Expand Geologic Site Characterization: $50 million to be used for site charac-
terization  activities  in  geologic  formations.  DOE  expects  to  require  projects  to  com-
plement  and  build  upon  the  existing  characterization  base  created  by  the  Regional
Partnerships,  looking  at  broadening  the  range  and  extent  of  geologic  basins  that
have been studied to date.

Initiate a Geologic Sequestration Training and Research Grant Program:
$20  million  for  geologic  sequestration  training  and  research  grants.  This  program
will emphasize advancing educational opportunities across a broad range of colleges
and universities.

INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS

Recognizing that climate change is a global issue that requires a global response,
the DOE plays an active leadership role in an international initiative known as the
Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF).

The  CSLF  is  a  voluntary  climate  initiative  of  developed  and  developing  nations
that,  collectively,  account  for  75  percent  of  all  manmade  carbon  dioxide  emissions.
It  is  currently  comprised  of  22  members,  including  21  countries  and  the  European
Commission.

Formed  in  2003,  the  CSLF  marshals  intellectual,  technical,  and  financial  re-
sources  from  all  parts  of  the  world  to  support  atmospheric  stabilization,  the  long-
term  goal  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  Mem-
bers  are  dedicated  to  collaboration  and  information  sharing  in  developing,  dem-
onstrating, and fostering the worldwide deployment of multiple technologies for the
capture  and  long-term  geologic  storage  of  carbon  dioxide  at  low  costs.  Additionally,
the  CSLF  is  committed  to  establishing  a  companion  foundation  promoting  legisla-
tive,  regulatory,  administrative,  and  institutional  practices  that  will  ensure  safe,
verifiable long-term storage.

numerous  countries  through  bilateral  agreements  and  multilateral  activities  to
identify areas of collaboration in promoting and developing clean fossil energy tech-
nologies internationally.

These activities include:
The U.S.-China Fossil Energy Protocol, a bilateral agreement on energy tech-
nology cooperation that has the goals of reducing the impact of China’s growing de-
mands  on  global  hydrocarbon  markets  and  improving  environmental  performance;
providing commercial opportunities for U.S. business; and acquiring unique informa-
tion of scientific or technical interest to DOE.

U.S.-India  Energy  Dialogue:  Coal  Working  Group:  The  Office  of  Fossil  En-
ergy  and  India’s  Ministry  of  Coal  jointly  chair  the  Coal  Working  Group  initiative
to exchange information on policies, programs, and technologies to promote the effi-
cient and environmentally responsible production and use of coal.

Global  Gas  Flaring  Reduction  Partnership:  DOE  is  working  with  the  World
Bank  and  others  to  support  national  governments  and  the  petroleum  industry  in
their  efforts  to  reduce  flaring  and  venting  of  gas  associated  with  the  extraction  of
crude oil. Gas flaring wastes a valuable clean energy resource and emits carbon di-
oxide, a greenhouse gas.

Asia  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation:  APEC’s  Energy  Working  Group  seeks  to
maximize  the  energy  sector’s  contribution  to  the  region’s  economic  and  social  well
being, while mitigating the environmental effects of energy supply and use. The Of-
fice  of  Fossil  Energy  provides  expertise  in  LNG  and  methane  hydrate  technologies
to the Energy Working Group.

The  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA):  The  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  is  in-
volved  in  many  aspects  of  the  IEA,  including  emergency  preparedness  and  clean
coal technology transfer. Increasingly, the IEA focuses on resolving energy and envi-
ronmental challenges, particularly relating to climate change.

The Office of Fossil Energy participates in the IEA Working Party on Fossil Fuels,
a highly effective method to create international support for Fossil Energy programs
and objectives such as IGCC and carbon sequestration. The primary objective for the
next three years will be to develop and implement activities to promote clean fossil

energy technologies internationally. The Office of Fossil Energy is currently working
on  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  to  the  G–8  on  Near-Term  Opportu-
nities for Carbon Capture and Storage.

IEA  Clean  Coal  Center:  The  IEA  Clean  Coal  Centre  is  a  collaborative  project
established in 1975 involving member countries of the IEA. The service is governed
by  representatives  of  member  countries,  the  European  Commission,  and  industrial
sponsors. The IEA Clean Coal Centre program of work contains studies of consider-
able significance for all countries involved in the use or supply of coal.

IEA Greenhouse Gas Program (IEAGHG): The IEAGHG is a collaborative re-
search  program  founded  in  1991.  The  members  include  17  countries,  the  European
Commission  and  17  multinational  industrial  sponsors.  Its  aim  is  to  provide  mem-
bers  with  definitive  information  on  the  role  that  technology  can  play  in  reducing
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  It  is  principally  focused  on  CCS;  how  mitigation  options
compare;  how  CCS  can  be  done  safely,  legally,  and  cost-effectively;  and  what  needs
to be done to introduce CCS and be confident it will be successful.

World Energy Council: World Energy Council (WEC) is an organization of more
than 100 countries headquartered in London covering all aspects of energy including
fossil,  nuclear,  hydro  and  renewables.  DOE  participates  through  the  WEC  Com-
mittee  on  Cleaner  Fossil  Fuel  Systems  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Fossil  Energy’s
Office of Clean Energy Collaboration. Committee members include 26 countries and
seven multilateral organizations striving to promote knowledge worldwide on the re-
search,  development,  demonstration,  and  deployment  of  cleaner  fossil  fuels  to  meet
global  energy  needs;  promote  the  clean  and  efficient  use  of  fossil  fuels,  with  a  con-
centration on carbon capture and storage.

Additionally,  numerous  international  projects  are  supported  through  DOE’s  core
advanced coal program. U.S. technological advances and expertise in CCS are being
shared  in  initiatives  such  as  the  Australian  Otway  Basin  project;  the  European
Union  funded  CO2SINK  project  in  Germany;  the  Algerian  In  Salah  industrial-scale
CO2 storage project; the Ordos Basin Assessment in China; the North Sea Sleipner
Project;  and  the  IEA  GHG  Weyburn-Midale  CO2 Monitoring  and  Storage  Project,
Zama Acid Gas Project, and the Fort Nelson Project, all in Canada.

CONCLUSIONS

Today,  nearly  three  out  of  every  four  coal-burning  power  plants  in  this  country
are  equipped  with  technologies  that  can  trace  their  roots  back  to  the  Department’s
advanced  coal  technology  program.  These  efforts  helped  accelerate  production  of
cost-effective  compliance  options  to  address  legacy  environmental  issues  associated
with coal use. Advanced CCS technologies will undoubtedly play a key role in miti-
gating  CO2 emissions  under  potential  future  carbon  stabilization  scenarios.  DOE’s
Program  is  helping  make  the  enabling  technologies  available.  The  United  States
must continue to show leadership in technology development and future deployment
to  bring  economic  rewards  and  new  business  opportunities  both  here  and  abroad.
I  applaud  the  efforts  of  this  committee  and  its  Members  for  taking  a  leadership

role in addressing these timely and significant issues.

BIOGRAPHY FOR VICTOR K. DER

Dr.  Der  is  currently  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Fossil  Energy  with
responsibilities  for  the  office  operations,  and  in  support  of  the  Assistant  Secretary,
he  manages  the  oversight  of  Fossil  Energy’s  Research  and  Development  (encom-
passing  coal,  oil,  and  natural  gas)  program  and  the  U.S.  Petroleum  Reserves.  Prior
that  he  was  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Clean  Coal  within  the  Fossil  Energy
Program  Office.  In  that  capacity,  he  was  responsible  for  directing  research  and  de-
velopment of clean coal research, development and demonstration, and implementa-
tion  of  energy  policy  initiatives  and  priorities  relating  to  clean  coal  utilization  and
its role in climate change mitigation including carbon capture and sequestration.

Dr. Der has worked at DOE for 35 years in various programs. He entered govern-
ment  service  as  a  reactor  intern  in  the  predecessor  agencies  to  DOE,  starting  with
Atomic  Energy  Commission.  He  worked  as  a  structural  and  materials  engineer  in
nuclear  reactor  plant  designs  of  the  Fast  Flux  Test  Facility  and  the  Clinch  River
Breeder  Reactor  Demonstration  during  the  Energy  Research  and  Development  Ad-
ministration.  Following  this  period  he  managed  research  in  the  civilian  radioactive

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MARK  GAFFIGAN,  DIRECTOR,  NATURAL
RESOURCES  AND  ENVIRONMENT  TEAM,  U.S.  GOVERNMENT
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Chairman  Baird,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  Mem-
bers  of  the  Subcommittee,  good  morning.  I  am  pleased  to  be  with
you  to  discuss  GAO’s  recent  report  on  the  Department  of  Energy’s
decision to restructure the FutureGen program. In 2003, DOE initi-
ated  FutureGen,  a  program  to  design,  build  and  operate  a  new
coal-fired  power  plant  that  combined  integrated  gasification  com-
bined  cycle  or  IGCC  technology  with  carbon  capture  and  storage.
However, in 2008, DOE announced that it had decided to restruc-
ture FutureGen. GAO’s report and the focus of my remarks address
three  questions  regarding  restructured  FutureGen.  One,  how  do
the goals of the proposed restructured FutureGen program compare
to  the  original  program?  Two,  how  does  restructured  FutureGen
compare  to  DOE’s  other  carbon  capture  in-storage  programs?  And
three, to what extent did DOE use sufficient information in its de-
cision to restructure FutureGen?

First, restructured FutureGen is very different from the from the
original  FutureGen  program.  While  Restructured  FutureGen
shares a common name and the overall goal of carbon capture and
storage,  it  is  fundamentally  different  from  the  original  FutureGen
program.  Most  significantly,  the  restructured  program  does  not
have an exclusive focus on the integration of integrated gasification
combined  cycle  technology  with  carbon  capture  and  storage.  In  ad-
dition,  the  restructured  program  does  not  have  international  part-
nerships  that,  in  the  original  FutureGen  program,  were  designed
to improve the global advancing of carbon capture and storage.

Finally, restructured FutureGen unlike the original FutureGen is
not designed to serve as a living laboratory host facility for gaining
broad  industry  acceptance  of  emerging  technologies.  It  moves  from
a research and development focus to a commercial focus.

In  comparison  to  DOE’s  other  carbon  capture  and  storage  pro-
grams,  restructured  FutureGen  is  most  like  round  three  of  the
Clean  Coal-Powered  Initiative.  Most  notably,  both  programs  fund
the  commercial  demonstration  of  carbon  capture  and  storage  at
coal-fired power plants and require industry participants to bear at
least 50 percent of the cost. Questions have been raised about how

Restructured  FutureGen  is  different  and  the  basis  for  the  decision
to restructure.

In  short,  DOE’s  decision  to  restructure  FutureGen  was  not  well-
explained.  DOE  based  its  decision  largely  on  its  conclusion  that
cost  for  the  original  FutureGen  had  doubled  and  would  escalate
substantially.  However,  this  conclusion  is  problematic  because  it
was  derived  from  a  comparison  of  two  cost  estimates  for  the  origi-
nal FutureGen that were not comparable. It compared an initial es-
timate  of  approximately  $950  million  that  was  in  constant  dollars
to a $1.8 billion that was inflated through the year 2017. The focus
on  the  difference  in  these  very  preliminary  cost  estimates  as  the
reason  to  restructure  FutureGen  did  not  provide  a  sound  basis  for
the decision.

In  contrast,  DOE’s  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  had  identified  and
analyzed  other  options  for  incremental  cost-saving  changes  to  the
original  program  such  as  reducing  the  CO2 capture  requirement.
However,  we  could  not  identify  any  comparable  analysis  that  sup-
ported the decision to restructure FutureGen.

By integrating IGCC and carbon capture and storage technology,
DOE’s original FutureGen program was intended to address signifi-
cant  technological,  cost,  and  regulatory  issues  associated  with  the
implementation of carbon capture and storage at the new plant. Al-
ternatively  the  restructured  program  leaves  open  the  possibility  of
successfully  applying  carbon  capture  and  storage  technology  to  ex-
isting  conventional  pulverized  coal-fired  power  plants,  an  impor-
tant goal in its own right, since those plants account for almost all
the coal-fired generating capacity in the United States and abroad.
However,  these  plants  will  age,  and  demand  for  new  sources  of
electricity will continue throughout the world. If coal is to be a fuel
source  of  the  future  and  if  CO2 emissions  are  to  be  controlled,  de-
veloping  new  plants  with  improvements  over  today’s  conventional
technology,  such  as  that  offered  by  IGCC,  might  also  be  an  impor-
tant goal.

In  weighing  different  goals  to  address  the  technological  barriers
that  are  associated  with  clean-coal  technology,  it  is  also  important
to recognize that technology must be considered in conjunction with
other barriers, most notably legal and regulatory uncertainties over
carbon  capture  and  storage  and  the  absence  of  a  national  strategy
to control CO2 emissions. That would provide the incentive for car-
bon capture and storage.

As  policy-makers  consider  a  path  forward  for  clean-coal  tech-
nologies, including the original concept of FutureGen, a comprehen-
sive analysis of the associated costs, benefits, and risks in this con-
text is most important.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  completes  my  remarks.  I  have  submitted  a

written statement and a copy of our report for your record.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  our  recent  report  on  the  Department  of
Energy’s  (DOE)  decision  to  restructure  the  FutureGen  program.1 As  requested,  my
remarks  will  focus  on  that  report,  which  examined  (1)  the  goals  of  the  original  and
restructured  FutureGen  programs,  (2)  the  similarities  and  differences  between  the
restructured  FutureGen  program  and  other  DOE  carbon  capture  and  storage  pro-
grams,  and  (3)  the  extent  to  which  DOE  used  sufficient  information  to  support  its
decision to restructure the FutureGen program.

As  you  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  coal  is  currently  the  world’s  leading  source  of  elec-
tricity. Coal-fired power plants generate about one-half of the electricity used in the
United States, as well as about one-third of the Nation’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emis-
sions,  which  contribute  to  climate  change.  In  2003,  DOE  initiated  FutureGen—a
program  to  design,  build,  and  operate  a  commercial-scale,  coal-fired  power  plant
that  incorporated  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  with  integrated  gasification
combined  cycle  (IGCC),  an  advanced  technology  for  generating  electricity  that  has
been  deployed  on  a  commercial  scale  at  only  two  coal-fired  power  plants  in  the
United  States.2 In  IGCC  power  plants,  coal  is  gasified  to  produce  a  synthesis  gas,
consisting  primarily  of  hydrogen,  carbon  monoxide,  and  CO2.  Then,  in  a  process
called  precombustion  CCS,  the  CO2 is  removed  and  separated  from  the  synthesis
gas  before  the  synthesis  gas  is  burned  in  a  combustion  turbine  to  generate  elec-
tricity. Through IGCC, electricity is generated more efficiently than through conven-
tional  pulverized  coal-fired  technology,  the  process  most  widely  in  use,  because
IGCC uses less coal to generate the same amount of electricity.

The original FutureGen plant was to capture and store underground about 90 per-
cent of its CO2 emissions. DOE’s cost share was to be 74 percent, and industry part-
ners  agreed  to  fund  the  rest.  Concerned  about  escalating  costs,  DOE  announced  in
January  2008  that  it  had  decided  to  restructure  FutureGen.  In  October  2008,  DOE
received  a  small  number  of  applications  for  the  restructured  FutureGen;  however,
some  of  these  applications  were  for  proposals  outside  the  restructured  FutureGen’s
scope.  As  we  reported,  DOE  is  currently  assessing  proposals  received  and  stated  it
expected  to  announce  a  selection  of  projects  by  December  2008;  however,  as  of  the
beginning of March 2009, it had made no decision. DOE requested supplemental in-
formation  from  restructured  FutureGen  applicants,  which  will  be  reviewed  before
any  selection  decision.3 As  you  know,  the  recently  enacted  American  Recovery  and
Reinvestment  Act  of  2009,  known  as  the  stimulus  law,  provides  DOE  an  additional
$3.4  billion  for  ‘‘Fossil  Energy  Research  and  Development.’’ 4 Such  a  substantial
amount  of  funding  could  significantly  impact  DOE’s  decisions  about  how  to  move
forward with programs such as FutureGen.

Our  report  provides  detailed  information  about  our  findings.  In  summary,  we

found the following:
• The overall goals of the original and restructured FutureGen programs are largely
similar in that both programs seek to produce electricity from coal with near-zero
emissions  by  using  CCS,  and  to  make  that  process  economically  viable  for  the
electric  power  industry.  However,  the  programs  have  different  approaches  for
achieving  their  goals,  which  could  have  different  impacts  on  the  commercial  ad-
vancement  of  CCS  and,  therefore,  result  in  two  largely  distinct  programs.  First,
the  original  program  focused  on  researching  and  developing  the  integration  of
IGCC  and  CCS  at  a  new,  commercial-scale,  coal-fired  power  plant,  while  the  re-
structured  FutureGen  aims  at  demonstrating  the  use  of  CCS  technology  at  one
or  more  new  or  existing  commercial  coal-fired  power  plants.  As  a  result,  the  re-
structured  program  could  provide  opportunities  to  learn  about  CCS  at  different
plants,  including  those  that  use  IGCC  and  conventional  ones  that  use  pulverized
coal  generating  technology.  However,  under  the  restructured  program,  learning
about  the  integration  of  IGCC  and  CCS  would  be  possible  only  if  DOE  received

prehensive  Analysis  of  Costs,  Benefits,  and  Risks,  GAO–09–248  (Washington,  D.C.:  Feb.  13,
2009).

2 Currently, only two IGCC plants operate at commercial scale in the United States. In service
since 1997, the Polk Station, near Mulberry, Florida, can provide 250 megawatts to the electric
grid.  The  Wabash  River  Coal  Gasification  Repowering  Project  is  the  first  full-size  commercial
gasification-combined cycle plant built in the United States, having begun operations in Novem-
ber  1995.  The  plant,  located  outside  West  Terre  Haute,  Indiana,  can  provide  262  megawatts  to
the electric grid.

3 DOE  has  identified  certain  details  regarding  the  negotiations  for  both  the  original  and  the
restructured  FutureGen  as  sensitive  or  proprietary  information.  Due  to  the  ongoing  nature  of
these  negotiations  for  the  restructured  FutureGen  and  the  fact  that  disclosure  of  sensitive/pro-
prietary  information  could  adversely  affect  negotiations  of  these  projects  and  related  future
projects, our discussion of some aspects of these negotiations is necessarily general.

applications  proposing  IGCC  and  selected  one  for  funding.  Second,  it  is  unclear
which  of  the  two  programs  would  advance  the  broader  roll  out  of  CCS  across  in-
dustry  more  quickly.  In  particular,  the  original  program  was  to  be  operated  by
a  nonprofit  consortium  of  some  of  the  largest  coal  producers  and  electric  power
companies  in  the  world  at  one  plant,  while  the  restructured  program  called  for
CCS projects at multiple commercial plants. DOE officials told us that the original
program would likely have improved the global advancement of CCS more quickly
than  the  restructured  program  because  of  its  various  international  partnerships
and  that  DOE  is  developing  an  approach  to  recoup  the  loss  of  international  in-
volvement  that  resulted  from  restructuring  FutureGen.  Finally,  the  original
FutureGen  would  have  served  as  an  operating  laboratory  host  facility  for  (1)
emerging technologies aimed at the goal of near-zero emissions (such as hydrogen
fuel cells and advanced gasification) and (2) gaining broad industry acceptance for
these  technologies.  In  contrast,  the  restructured  FutureGen  would  not  include  a
facility  for  testing  these  technologies,  and  its  ability  to  advance  them  would,
therefore, be limited.

• DOE  manages  a  portfolio  of  clean  coal  programs  that  research  and  develop  CCS
technology  or  demonstrate  its  application.  The  restructured  FutureGen  differs  in
important  ways  from  most  of  DOE’s  other  CCS  programs,  with  the  exception  of
one  program—Round  III  of  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  (CCPI).  Both  the  re-
structured  FutureGen  and  CCPI  (1)  fund  the  commercial  demonstration  of  CCS
at  new  or  existing  coal-fired  power  plants  and  (2)  require  industry  participants
to bear at least 50 percent of costs. We reported that the restructured FutureGen
targets a higher amount of CO2 to be captured and stored (at least 1 million met-
ric  tons  stored  annually,  per  plant)  than  CCPI  does  (300,000  metric  tons  of  CO2
stored  or  put  to  use  annually,  such  as  to  enhance  oil  recovery,  per  plant).  How-
ever, CCPI’s goals may be more achievable for industry partners than those of the
restructured  FutureGen  and,  therefore,  lead  to  more  industry  participation.  Re-
garding  the  restructured  program’s  differences  from  most  of  the  other  CCS  pro-
grams,  the  restructured  FutureGen  would  integrate  key  components  of  CCS  at
commercial  coal-fired  power  plants,  such  as  CO2 capture,  compression,  transport,
storage, and monitoring of stored CO2. In contrast, most of DOE’s other CCS pro-
grams concentrate on developing individual components of CCS, such as CO2 stor-
age, and/or an individual component and a related one, such as capture and com-
pression.

• Contrary  to  best  practices,  DOE  did  not  base  its  decision  to  restructure
FutureGen  on  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  factors  such  as  the  associated  costs,
benefits, and risks. DOE based its decision largely on its conclusion that costs for
the  original  FutureGen  had  doubled  and  would  escalate  substantially.  However,
this conclusion was problematic because it was derived from a comparison of two
cost  estimates  for  the  original  FutureGen  that  were  not  comparable;  DOE’s  $950
million  estimate  was  in  constant  2004  dollars,  while  the  $1.8  billion  estimate  of
DOE’s industry partners was inflated through 2017. As a result, DOE has no as-
surance  that  the  restructured  FutureGen  is  the  best  option  to  advance  CCS.  In
contrast,  DOE’s  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  had  identified  and  analyzed  13  other  op-
tions for incremental, cost-saving changes to the original program, such as reduc-
ing  the  CO2 capture  requirement.  While  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  did  not  con-
sider  all  of  these  options  to  be  viable,  it  either  recommended  or  noted  several  of
them  for  consideration,  with  potential  savings  ranging  from  $30  million  to  $55
million each.

Conclusions

According  to  various  energy  experts,  for  the  foreseeable  future,  because  coal  is
abundant and relatively inexpensive, it will remain a significant fuel for the genera-
tion of electric power in the United States and the world. However, coal-fired power
plants  are  a  significant  source  of  CO2 and  other  emissions  responsible  for  climate
change. Hence, for at least the near-term, any government policies that address cli-
mate change will need to have a goal of significantly reducing CO2 and other emis-
sions  from  coal-fired  power  plants.  While  CCS  is  still  in  its  infancy,  it  may  be  a
promising technology to achieve these purposes. By integrating IGCC and CCS tech-
nology  at  an  operating  laboratory  host  facility,  DOE’s  original  FutureGen  program
was intended to address significant technological, cost, and regulatory issues associ-
ated with the implementation of CCS at a new plant. Alternatively, the restructured
FutureGen left open the possibility of successfully applying CCS technology to exist-
ing  conventional,  pulverized  coal-fired  power  plants—an  important  goal  in  its  own
right,  since  those  plants  account  for  almost  all  of  the  coal-fired  generating  capacity
in the United States and abroad. However, DOE’s decision to restructure FutureGen

and  remove  the  program’s  emphasis  on  integrating  IGCC  and  CCS  technology  was
not well documented or explained, in light of the fact that DOE already had existing
programs to address CCS at existing coal-fired power plants.

Given the magnitude of the current fiscal and economic challenges facing our na-
tion, along with the urgent need to secure an adequate and sustainable energy sup-
ply  that  does  not  contribute  to  climate  change,  much  rides  on  the  success  of  clean
coal programs, such as FutureGen. To ensure the best uses of billions of federal dol-
lars,  informed  and  thoughtful  approaches  should  be  taken  when  making  decisions
about these programs, including the restructuring of FutureGen. Such informed de-
cision-making  has  become  even  more  critical  with  the  important  opportunity  that
over  $3  billion  in  additional  funding  for  fossil  energy  research  and  development  in
the  recently  enacted  stimulus  law  provides  DOE  for  promoting  cleaner  forms  of
power generation.

Along  these  lines,  to  help  DOE  make  more  fully  informed  decisions  on  how  best
to move forward with FutureGen, our February 2009 report recommended that DOE
conduct  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  different  options.  Specifically,  to  help  ensure
the  widespread  commercial  advancement  of  CCS  while  protecting  taxpayer  inter-
ests,  we  recommended  that,  before  implementing  significant  changes  to  FutureGen
or obligating additional funds for such purposes, the Secretary of Energy direct DOE
staff to prepare a comprehensive analysis comparing the relative costs, benefits, and
risks  of  a  range  of  options,  including  the  original  and  restructured  FutureGen  pro-
grams  and  incremental  options  for  modifying  the  original  program.  We  also  rec-
ommended  that  the  Secretary  consider  the  results  of  the  comprehensive  analysis
and base any decisions that would alter the original FutureGen on the most advan-
tageous mix of costs, benefits, and risks resulting from the options evaluated. In re-
viewing  a  draft  of  our  report,  DOE  did  not  comment  on  the  report’s  recommenda-
tions.

In performing our work, we reviewed best practices for making programmatic de-
cisions,  FutureGen  plans  and  budgets,  and  documents  on  the  restructuring  of
FutureGen.  We  also  contacted  DOE,  industry  partners,  and  experts.  We  conducted
this  performance  audit  from  June  2008  to  February  2009,  in  accordance  with  gen-
erally  accepted  government  auditing  standards.  Those  standards  require  that  we
plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  sufficient,  appropriate  evidence  to  provide  a
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We
believe  that  the  evidence  obtained  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  completes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  re-
spond to any questions you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have at this
time.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ROBERT  J.  FINLEY,  DIRECTOR,  ENERGY
AND  EARTH  RESOURCES  CENTER,  ILLINOIS  STATE  GEO-
LOGICAL SURVEY
Dr. FINLEY. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I ap-
preciate the opportunity to appear before you today and offer com-
ments on carbon sequestration.

Understanding the capacity to geologically sequester carbon diox-
ide  produced  as  a  byproduct  of  fossil  fuel  and  biofuel  use  is  an  es-
sential  strategy  to  mitigate  climate  change  related  to  the  buildup
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In 2007, the Fourth Assess-
ment  Report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change
stated  that  ‘‘carbon  capture  and  storage  in  underground  geological
formations  is  a  new  technology  with  the  potential  to  make  an  im-
portant contribution to mitigation by 2030. Technical, economic and
regulatory developments will affect the actual contribution.’’ At the
Illinois State Geological Survey, a unit of the University of Illinois,
we  have  been  investigating  carbon  sequestration  technology  since
2003  as  part  of  a  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  Regional  Carbon  Se-
questration  Partnership.  Our  Partnership,  the  Midwest  Geological
Sequestration  Consortium  covers  the  Illinois  Basin,  a  60,000
square-mile area that covers most of Illinois, southwestern Indiana,
and  western  Kentucky.  Our  Phase  I  Characterization  effort,  from
2003 to 2005, focused on compiling existing information. Our Phase
II  validation  effort  currently  underway  involves  multiple  small-
scale,  field  pilot  injection  projects.  Most  importantly,  we  are  now
engaged in a critical Phase III deployment effort, the Illinois Basin-
Decatur  test  site,  that  will  offer  significant  advances  in  carbon  se-
questration technology.

After  two  years  of  site-specific  planning  and  development  and
planning at a site in Decatur, Illinois, we began on February 14 of
this  year  the  drilling  of  a  7,500  feet  deep  injection  well  that  will
receive  1,000  metric  tons  per  day  of  CO2.  As  of  this  morning,  we
were  drilling  below  3,546  feet.  This  is  the  first  Phase  III  deploy-
ment well in the Nation drilled as part of the DOE regional carbon
sequestration partnership program. We will be injecting over three
years to meet an injection goal of one million metric tons. The per-
mit is held by the Archer Daniels Midland Company, who has pro-

vided  a  half-square  mile  site,  logistical  and  engineering  support,
and will provide the CO2 as a product of their fuel ethanol produc-
tion operations.

We are confident that our work over the preceding five years and
a  year-long  permitting  process  has  resulted  in  an  exceptional  site
for  deployment  phase  testing.  We  have  evaluated  subsurface  rock
formations to define the capability of a reservoir to hold carbon di-
oxide, and we have defined multiple thick and competent reservoir
seals,  and  we  have  demonstrated  that  there  are  no  detectable
faults  and  fractures  that  could  serve  as  leakage  pathways  back  to
the surface.

As  a  climate  change  mitigation  strategy,  the  CO2 must  remain
in place and not leak back to the atmosphere, not contaminate po-
table ground water, not affect surface biota, and not present a risk
to human health and safety. This implies that we must do an excel-
lent  job  of  investigating  the  site.  We  have  been  carrying  out  envi-
ronmental  site  monitoring  since  mid-2008.  Before  CO2 is  ever  in-
jected,  we  will  have  more  than  a  year  of  background  data  on
groundwater  chemistry,  soil  gas  composition,  plant  stress  assessed
through color infrared aerial imagery, and atmospheric monitoring.
We  have  12  groundwater  wells  over  the  projected  area  of  the  sub-
surface plume and beyond. We will conduct more geophysical stud-
ies  that  will  show  us  in  three  dimensions  where  in  the  reservoir
rock  the  CO2 is  actually  located.  Most  importantly,  we  will  drill
two  additional  7,500  feet  deep  observation  wells  within  the  half-
square  mile  area  of  the  plume  to  calibrate  these  geophysical  stud-
ies. These same wells will also serve as early warnings of any fail-
ure  of  our  primary  reservoir  seal,  an  outcome  with  very  low  prob-
ability  but  one  that  we  nevertheless  must  demonstrate  is  not  tak-
ing place.

In  conclusion,  well  characterized  sites  with  appropriate  geology
and  careful  monitoring  can  make  a  contribution  and,  in  fact,  must
be part of a portfolio response to dealing with carbon dioxide emis-
sions.  In  our  regional  partnership,  we  have  a  comprehensive  re-
search  agenda  that  we  believe  will  show  that  geological  sequestra-
tion  can  be  scaled  up  to  be  a  safe  and  effective  tool  to  combat  cli-
mate change. Further, we are working to ensure that we share our
results  with  research  consortia  around  the  world.  A  State  Depart-
ment-World  Resources  Institute  delegation  of  university  research-
ers and corporate officials from China visited the Illinois Basin-De-
catur  drill  site  two  weeks  ago,  and  we  will  make  a  reciprocal  visit
to  China  this  coming  June.  Next  week,  I  will  present  our  partner-
ship  results  at  a  meeting  of  the  CO2Geonet  European  Research
Network in Italy.

While there is more yet to do in understanding the contributions
that  geological  carbon  sequestration  can  make  at  large  scales  in
combating  climate  change,  and  more  of  these  efforts  will  indeed
take  place  as  a  result  of  the  provisions  of  the  Recovery  and  Rein-
vestment  Act,  I  believe  we  are  now  moving  at  an  accelerating  pace
to  develop  the  technology  and  to  share  it  around  the  world  for  our
common benefit. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT J. FINLEY

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear
before  you  today  to  offer  comments  on  carbon  sequestration.  Understanding  the  ca-
pacity to geologically sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a byproduct of fos-
sil fuel use, including the use of advanced coal technologies, is an essential strategy
to mitigate climate change related to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmos-
phere.  In  2007,  the  Fourth  Assessment  Report  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on
Climate Change (IPCC) stated that ‘‘carbon capture and storage in underground ge-
ological  formations  is  a  new  technology  with  the  potential  to  make  an  important
contribution  to  mitigation  by  2030.  Technical,  economic  and  regulatory  develop-
ments  will  affect  the  actual  contribution.’’  At  the  Illinois  State  Geological  Survey,
a  unit  of  the  University  of  Illinois,  we  have  been  investigating  sequestration  tech-
nology  since  2003  as  part  of  a  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  Regional  Carbon
Sequestration  Partnership.  Our  Partnership,  the  Midwest  Geological  Sequestration
Consortium  (MGSC),  covers  the  Illinois  Basin,  a  60,000  sq.  mi.,  geological  feature
that extends beneath most of Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and western Kentucky.
Our Phase I Characterization effort, 2003–2005 focused on compiling existing infor-
mation  that,  when  evaluated,  indicated  the  Illinois  Basin  has  suitable  geology  for
geological  carbon  sequestration.  Our  Phase  II  Validation  effort,  involving  multiple
small-scale,  field  pilot  injection  projects,  began  in  late  2005  and  will  continue  to  be
carried out through 2009. Most importantly, we are now engaged in a critical Phase
III Deployment effort, the Illinois Basin-Decatur test site, that will offer significant
advances in geological carbon sequestration technology.

After two years of site-specific planning and development at a site in Decatur, Illi-
nois we began, on February 14, 2009, the drilling of a 7,500 feet deep injection well
that  will  receive  1,000  metric  tons  per  day  of  CO2,  beginning  about  this  time  next
year.  This  is  the  first  Phase  III  deployment  well  in  the  Nation  drilled  as  part  of
the  DOE  regional  sequestration  partnership  program  and  the  first  well  permitted
for  one  million  metric  tons  under  existing  Class  I  U.S.  EPA  Underground  Injection
Control regulations. We will be injecting over three years to meet our 1 million met-
ric  ton  objective.  The  permit  is  held  by  the  Archer  Daniels  Midland  Company,  who
has  provided  a  half-square  mile  site,  logistical  and  engineering  support,  and  will
provide the CO2 from their fuel ethanol production operation. We are confident that
our  work  over  the  preceding  five  years  and  a  year-long  permitting  process  has  re-
sulted in an exceptional site for Deployment phase testing. We have evaluated sub-
surface rock formations to define a reservoir to hold the CO2, defined multiple thick
and competent reservoir seals, and demonstrated that there are no detectable faults
and  fractures  that  could  become  leakage  pathways.  We  believe  we  will  be  able  to
show that the sequestration process can be safe and effective.

As  a  climate  change  mitigation  strategy,  the  CO2 must  remain  in  place  and  not
leak back to the atmosphere, not contaminate potable ground water, not affect sur-
face  biota,  and  not  present  a  risk  to  human  health  and  safety.  That  implies  that
we  must  do  an  excellent  job  of  investigating  the  properties  of  these  rocks  and  the
fluids  now  within  them  and  of  predicting  their  performance  in  the  future.  At  our
Illinois  Basin-Decatur  site,  we  have  been  carrying  out  environmental  monitoring
since mid-2008. Before CO2 is ever injected, we will have more than a year of back-
ground  data  on  groundwater  chemistry,  soil  gas  composition,  plant  stress  assessed
through  color  infrared  imagery,  and  atmospheric  monitoring.  We  have  12  ground-
water  wells  over  the  projected  area  of  the  subsurface  CO2 plume  and  beyond.  We
will  conduct  more  geophysical  studies  that  will  show  us  in  three  dimensions  where
within the reservoir rock the CO2 is actually located. Most importantly, we will drill
two  additional  7,500  feet  deep  observation  wells  within  the  half-square  mile  area
of the plume to calibrate the geophysical studies and ensure that our understanding
of  the  fate  of  the  CO2 is  as  complete  as  possible.  These  same  wells  will  also  serve
as early warnings of any failure of our primary reservoir seal, an outcome with very
low probability, but one that we nevertheless must demonstrate is not taking place.
We have a comprehensive risk assessment process in place that defines our response
to equipment failures, accidents, and geological problems.

Let  me  conclude  with  some  observations  on  the  process  to  date.  We  sometimes
read  comments  that  geological  carbon  sequestration  is  an  untested  technology  and
therefore cannot be part of the global climate change response. I would suggest the
opposite:  that  well  characterized  sites  with  appropriate  geology  and  careful  moni-
toring  can  make  a  contribution,  and,  in  fact,  must  be  part  of  a  portfolio  response
to  dealing  with  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  In  our  regional  partnership,  the  MGSC,
we  are  addressing  every  element  of  a  comprehensive  research  agenda  that  we  be-

we share our results with research consortia around the world. A State Department-
World  Resources  Institute  delegation  of  university  researchers  and  corporate  offi-
cials from China visited the Illinois Basin-Decatur site two weeks ago; we will make
a reciprocal visit to China in June. Next week, I will present our partnership results
at  a  meeting  of  the  CO2Geonet  European  (research)  Network  in  Italy.  While  there
is  more  yet  to  do  in  understanding  the  contributions  that  geological  carbon  seques-
tration  can  make  at  larger  scales  in  combating  climate  change,  and  more  of  these
efforts  will  take  place  as  a  result  of  the  provisions  of  the  American  Recovery  and
Reinvestment  Act,  I  believe  we  are  now  moving  at  an  accelerating  pace  to  develop
this technology and to share it around the world for our common benefit. Thank you
for the opportunity to be here this morning.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  LARRY  S.  MONROE,  SENIOR  RESEARCH
CONSULTANT;  MANAGER,  ENGINEERING  SCIENCE  AND
TECHNOLOGY,  SOUTHERN  COMPANY,  BIRMINGHAM,  ALA-
BAMA
Mr.  MONROE.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  today  about  South-
ern  Company’s  activities  and  plans  for  advanced  coal  technologies.
Southern  Company  is  a  vertically  integrated  utility  serving  over
four  million  customers  in  the  southeast.  We  are  one  of  the  largest
electricity  generators  in  the  United  States,  with  some  70  percent
of our energy coming from coal.

I am a manager of engineering science and technology for South-
ern  Company.  I  have  been  researching  emissions  control  for  coal-
powered  plants  for  over  25  years.  Southern  Company  has  a  long
history  of  cooperative  work  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  in
development of technologies for the utility industry, including work
on  selective  catalytic  reduction  for  NOΧ emissions  from  gas  scrub-
bers for sulfur oxide emission and mercury-control technologies.

As  we  face  a  future  with  policies  that  would  limit  emissions  of
carbon  dioxide,  we  believe  that  coal  must  continue  to  play  a  role.
Further,  we  believe  that  coal  can  and  must  play  a  role  going  for-
ward  with  constraints  on  carbon  emissions.  To  achieve  this  goal,
technologies are currently being developed and adapted from other
industries  to  capture  and  store  emissions  of  CO2.  However,  the
technologies  are  not  yet  ready  for  utilities  to  use  commercially.
They  are  not  yet  proven  in  power  plant  service,  and  as  of  today,

they are too costly. This is the issue going forward. How can these
technologies be proven and the cost reduced to make them commer-
cially viable in the future?

Southern Company is active in developing and demonstrating ad-
vanced  coal  technology  to  meet  this  large  challenge.  First  I  will
talk about our sequestration efforts.

As  a  charter  member  of  the  Southeast  Regional  Carbon  Seques-
tration Partnership or SECARB, Southern Company has co-funded
its  activities  and  served  as  a  host  for  a  Phase  II  project  injecting
3,000 tons of CO2 under one of our power plants in southeast Mis-
sissippi. Working further with SECARB, we have a goal to scale up
to a Phase III sequestration project of 100,000 tons of CO2 per year
in  similar  geology  at  another  one  of  our  Gulf  Coast  power  plants.
This  proposed  project  would  feature  a  25-megawatt  scale  CO2 cap-
ture plant that would be built to supply the CO2 for the sequestra-
tion  demonstration.  We  have  a  further  goal  of  developing  an  even
larger  scale-up  of  the  sequestration  project  that  would  feature  in-
jection  of  one  million  tons  of  CO2 per  year  for  five  years  into  the
saline  reservoirs  of  the  Gulf  Coast  Region.  This  project  would  in-
clude  the  170-megawatt  capture  plant  to  supply  the  CO2.  We  sub-
mitted  this  proposed  project  in  response  to  both  the  restructured
FutureGen solicitation as well as CCPI Round III.

Now you will notice that both of these two steps in sequestration
scale-up are planned to also demonstrate CO2 capture at increasing
scale on conventional coal power plants.

For IGCC, we have asked the Mississippi Public Service Commis-
sion  for  approval  to  build  a  600-megawatt  IGCC  power  plant  in
eastern  Mississippi  using  local  lignite  coal  and  design  for  50  per-
cent CO2 capture. The CO2 would be sequestered and enhanced oil
recovery  operations  in  Mississippi  oil  fields.  This  new  power  plant
would  be  partially  funded  with  DOE  funds  from  CCPI  round  two
and  with  investment  tax  credits  authorized  by  the  Energy  Policy
Act of 2005. Also in partnership with the DOE, Southern Company
operates a research station in Wilsonville, Alabama, focused on de-
veloping  advanced  power  generating  technologies,  including  funda-
mental R&D for coal gasification. It is now moving its focus toward
basic  R&D  and  scale-up  of  technologies  to  capture  CO2 from  both
conventional and IGCC coal plants.

You can see the Southern Company is working on four areas we
believe  to  be  important:  large-scale  sequestration  tests,  CO2 cap-
ture  from  conventional  coal  plants,  IGCC  plants  with  carbon  cap-
ture,  and  fundamental  R&D  for  next  generation  technologies.  The
issues  to  be  overcome  for  widespread  commercial  deployment  of
carbon  capture  and  sequestration  are  cost  and  timing.  Both  the
pilot  and  industrial-scale  trials  of  CO2 capture  systems  are  much
more  expensive  to  build  and  operate  than  technologies  for  NOΧ,
SO2,  or  mercury.  The  same  high-cost  penalties  apply  to  full-scale
power plants. To address high cost, we strongly think that a robust
program  of  both  technology  development  and  a  program  of  basic
R&D  are  needed.  Many  of  the  Nation’s  scientists  are  only  now
turning  their  attention  to  this  field,  and  breakthroughs  are  pos-
sible. As for timing, the issue is the need to demonstrate to various
stakeholders  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  geological  sequestra-
tion.  As  MIT  recommends,  we  think  it  is  necessary  for  the  Nation

to  have  multiple,  large-scale  sequestration  demonstrations  of  over
one  million  tons  of  CO2 per  year  for  at  least  five  years.  In  order
to  have  these  results  in  adequate  time,  these  demonstrations  need
to be started as soon as possible.

Working in partnership with the U.S. DOE and others, Southern
Company  looks  forward  to  working  on  the  challenge  of  capturing
CO2 from coal plants and demonstrating geological sequestration of
CO2.

Summary

Southern Company is active in developing and demonstrating advanced coal tech-
nologies.  As  a  charter  member  of  the  Southeast  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration
Partnership  (SECARB),  Southern  has  co-funded  SECARB’s  activities,  as  well  as
serving  as  a  host  site  for  a  Phase  II  sequestration  project  injecting  3,000  tons  into
a  saline  reservoir  at  one  of  our  power  plants  in  southeast  Mississippi.  With
SECARB, we have a goal to scale up to a sequestration project of 100,000 to 150,000
tons  CO2 per  year  into  similar  geology  at  another  of  our  Gulf  Coast  power  plants.
This  project  would  feature  a  25  MWe  scale  CO2 capture  plant  built  by  Southern
Company and research partners to supply the CO2 for the sequestration project.

Southern  Company  has  a  further  goal  of  developing  a  larger  scale  up  of  this  se-
questration project that would feature one million tons CO2 per year for at least five
years  into  the  saline  reservoirs  of  the  Gulf  Coast  region.  Building  on  the  results  of
the smaller demonstration, this project would include a 170 MWe CO2 capture plant
to supply the CO2 for the sequestration project. This proposed project was submitted
by  Southern  Company  in  response  to  both  the  Restructured  FutureGen  solicitation
as  well  as  the  CCPI  Round  3  solicitation.  Southern  Company  will  likely  resubmit
this project to CCPI 3 when it is reopened later this year.

Southern  Company’s  Mississippi  Power  affiliate  has  asked  the  Mississippi  Public
Service Commission for approval to build a 600 MWe (net) IGCC power plant using
native  lignite  and  designed  for  50  percent  CO2 capture  from  startup.  The  captured
CO2 would  be  sequestered  in  EOR  operations  in  Mississippi  oil  fields.  This  new
power  plant  is  partially  funded  with  DOE  funds  from  CCPI  Round  2  and  with  in-
vestment tax credits authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

In  partnership  with  the  DOE,  Southern  Company  operates  a  research  station  in
Wilsonville,  Alabama,  that  has  focused  on  advanced  power  generating  technologies,
including  fundamental  R&D  for  coal  gasification,  and  is  now  moving  its  focus  to-
wards  fundamental  R&D  and  scale  up  for  technologies  to  capture  CO2 from  both
conventional combustion coal plants and IGCC plants.

The  barriers  to  widespread  commercial  deployment  for  CCS  are  mostly  cost  and
timing.  Both  the  pilot  and  industrial  scale  trials  of  CO2 capture  systems  are  much
more  expensive  to  build  and  operate  than  the  technologies  that  have  been  tested
and  developed  for  control  of  other  emissions  like  NOÆ,  SO2,  or  mercury.  The  same
high  cost  penalties  apply  to  current  CO2 capture  and  sequestration  approaches  for
full scale power plants. Therefore, both a robust program of technology development
and a program of fundamental R&D are needed. Many of the Nation’s scientists are
only  just  now  turning  their  attention  to  this  field  and  breakthroughs  are  possible.
New science, teamed with scale up and demonstration programs will help bring for-
ward affordable and effective CCS technologies.

A  parallel  barrier  to  widespread  deployment  of  CCS  is  the  need  to  demonstrate
to  various  stakeholders  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  geological  sequestration.  To
get  to  that  point,  it  is  necessary  for  the  Nation  to  have  multiple  concurrent  large
scale sequestration demonstrations of over one million tons CO2 per year for at least
five  years  in  duration.  In  order  to  have  these  results  in  adequate  time,  these  dem-
onstrations need to be started as soon as possible.

Working in partnership with the U.S. DOE, vendors, and other utilities, Southern
Company  looks  forward  to  the  challenge  of  developing,  demonstrating,  and  improv-
ing  technologies  to  capture  CO2 from  coal-based  power  plants  and  towards  dem-
onstrating the effectiveness of geological sequestration of CO2.

Introduction

Chairman  Baird,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  about  Southern  Company’s
activities  and  plans  for  developing  and  demonstrating  advanced  coal  technologies.
Southern Company is a super regional energy company serving customers in Ala-
bama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. Southern Company is the one of the largest
generators  of  electricity  in  the  United  States  with  42,000  megawatts  of  generating
capacity  and  over  21,000  megawatts  of  it  is  coal-fired.  I  hold  a  Ph.D.  in  Chemical
Engineering  from  MIT,  and  have  been  involved  in  research  on  pollution  control  for
coal-based power plants for over 25 years in university, not-for-profit research insti-
tute, and corporate settings. At Southern Company, I have two roles: I support our
technology research organization as a senior research consultant and I also support
our gasification and carbon capture research station as the Manager of Engineering
Science  and  Technology.  With  these  efforts,  I  am  deeply  involved  with  the  develop-
ment and demonstration of advanced ways of using coal to generate electricity.

Southern  Company  has  a  long  history  of  cooperative  work  with  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  in  development  of  technologies  for  the  utility  industry,  including
work  on  low  NOÆ burners  and  selective  catalytic  reduction  (SCR)  systems  for  NOÆ
emissions  reductions,  flue  gas  de-sulfurization  (FGD)  systems  for  sulfur  oxides  re-
ductions,  mercury  control  technologies  to  reduce  mercury  emissions,  and  various
others.

As  we  face  a  future  with  possible  legislation  and/or  regulations  that  would  limit
emissions  of  greenhouse  gases,  including  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  we  believe  that  coal
must  continue  to  play  a  role  in  the  energy  future  of  the  country.  It  currently  rep-
resents  50  percent  of  the  electricity  generated  in  the  Nation  today  and  it’s  ample
and relatively low cost domestic supply means it must continue to power our homes,
businesses, and industries in the future. We believe however that coal can and must
play  a  role  in  a  future  with  constraints  on  carbon  emissions.  Technologies  are  cur-
rently being developed and adapted from other industries to capture and store emis-
sions of CO2 from coal power plants to achieve this goal. However, the technologies
are  not  yet  ready  for  the  utility  sector  to  use  in  a  commercial  way  -  they  are  not
yet proven in utility service and as of today, they are too costly in both capital and
operating  expenses.  This  is  the  issue  going  forward,  how  can  these  technologies  (or
new ones not yet invented) be proven and the costs reduced to make them commer-
cially viable in the future for which they will be needed?

1.0 Development of Technology for the Utility Industry for Carbon Capture

and Storage (CCS)

The  lack  of  large  scale  storage  of  electricity  means  that  technologies  for  gener-
ating electricity must be proven and robust in order to maintain the reliability and
stability of the electric grid. Generation must meet demand and the industry cannot
test new technologies at full scale without assurance that it will not threaten oper-
ations  and  reliability.  For  this  reason,  the  utility  industry  has  learned  that  new
technologies  and  processes  must  be  developed  and  proven  in  a  series  of  tests  that
start at small sizes and move to progressively larger sizes before they can be relied
upon at a full scale generating plant. It is typical for new utility technologies to take
four  or  five  demonstration  steps  and  between  seven  to  fifteen  years  of  development
time to prove that they are adequate, robust, affordable, and reliable.

The  development  path  of  technologies  to  capture  and  store  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)
emissions from coal-based power plants will follow a similar path. Given that regu-
latory  or  legislative  efforts  to  limit  CO2 emissions  from  power  plants  are  active,
there is a pressing need to develop technologies that can be used in coal-based elec-
tricity  generation  and  simultaneously  achieve  the  environmental,  economic,  and
operational  requirements.  Carbon  capture  and  sequestration  (CCS)  for  coal-based
power  plants  is  really  a  series  of  four  steps:  (1)  capturing  the  CO2 from  the  power
plant,  (2)  compressing  the  CO2 to  the  pressure  required  for  pipeline  transport,  (3)
transporting the CO2 through a pipeline to the sequestration field, and (4) injecting
the CO2 deep underground into stable geological structures (sequestration).

CO2 capture is a technology and cost challenge; processes in the chemical and pe-
troleum  industries  have  been  developed  to  capture  CO2 from  similar  streams,  al-
though not with some of the particular difficulties nor the scale facing large central
station  power  plants.  Additionally,  the  costs  of  these  capture  processes  at  the  scale
of  utility  power  plants  is  very  high.  Current  capture  technologies  can  add  30  to  85
percent  to  the  cost  of  electricity  from  the  plant.  The  main  issue  is  the  amount  of
heat required to operate the capture plant which can mean a loss of 20 to 25 percent
of the electrical output from a plant where this technology is added. Integrated Gas-
ification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants, where coal is gasified and burned in a com-

bustion  turbine—steam  turbine  combination,  offer  some  promise  that  the  CO2 can
be captured from the synthetic gas (syngas) before combustion. This presents advan-
tages  because  the  CO2 is  at  higher  concentrations  in  the  syngas  and  it  is  already
at  pressure  and  therefore  may  require  less  of  the  compression  energy  described
next. However, the vast majority of existing plants are conventional coal combustion
units, with only two operational IGCC plants in the entire U.S.

Compression  of  the  CO2 can  be  accomplished  with  available  technologies,  al-
though the compression costs can amount to 10 percent of the power plant electrical
output.  (For  the  steam  requirements  for  capture  and  the  energy  for  compression  of
the  CO2,  this  could  total  some  30–35  percent  of  the  energy  output  of  the  plant  to
operate  with  90  percent  CO2 capture.)  For  new  conventional  coal  plants  with  CCS,
it is possible to integrate the compression into the steam cycle of the plant and some
efficiency improvements can be made.

Pipeline transport of CO2 to sequestration sites is a conventional technology avail-
able  today—the  U.S.  has  over  3,600  miles  of  CO2 pipelines  to  move  the  gas  from
natural  and  industrial  sources  to  oil  fields  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR).  CO2 is
used to pressurize oil fields and the CO2 dissolves into the crude oil making it easier
to  flow  out  of  the  underground  reservoir.  Pipeline  issues  for  large  scale  CCS  are
mainly  associated  with  the  expected  difficulty  in  siting  and  acquiring  property  for
pipeline routes. It has been estimated that a pipeline network equal to one-third of
the  size  of  the  existing  natural  gas  pipeline  network  would  be  needed  to  capture
CO2 from the existing coal fired fleet in the U.S. (MIT’s ‘‘The Future of Coal’’ states
that  if  all  of  the  coal  power  plant  carbon  emissions  are  captured  and  transported
by pipeline, the CO2 moved would be equal to three times the weight of the annual
natural gas delivered by the U.S. pipeline system, but only one-third of its volume.)
The most challenging aspect of developing CCS for the utility industry is seques-
tration.  The  technology  for  injecting  CO2 underground  for  EOR  is  well-developed
and the history of EOR operations indicates that sequestration can be accomplished
in  a  safe  and  secure  manner.  However,  the  scale  and  potential  widespread  location
of sequestration sites for utility capture of CO2 will require that sequestration tests
be made at sufficient scale for multi-year periods to demonstrate to stakeholders in-
cluding  the  general  public,  regulators,  utilities,  insurance  companies,  and  financial
entities,  that  it  is  safe  and  effective.  MIT,  in  their  ‘‘The  Future  of  Coal’’  report,
states  that  ‘‘we  believe  high  priority  should  be  given  to  a  program  that  will  dem-
onstrate  CO2 sequestration  at  a  scale  of  one  million  tons  CO2 per  year  in  several
geologies.’’  They  further  recommend  ‘‘a  minimum  of  three  projects  . . .  of  the  order
of  one  million  tons  CO2/year  for  a  minimum  of  five  years.’’  Unfortunately,  it  is  not
possible  to  accelerate  the  timescales  for  sequestration  tests,  so  it  is  necessary  to
start  these  projects  as  soon  as  possible.  Because  we  need  to  study  the  movement
of  CO2 in  the  underground  structure,  there  are  no  good  technical  ways  to  make  it
move  faster  without  disrupting  the  test.  In  other  words,  the  spread  of  the  CO2 will
be predicted with models at the beginning of injection, and the goal of these seques-
tration  tests  is  to  see  if  the  spread  of  injected  CO2 matches  the  model  predictions
in both distance and time to get there.

2.0 Accelerated Technology Development for Utility CCS

As  described  above,  the  normal  technology  path  for  new  technology  development
in the utility industry is to proceed from an invention or development in the labora-
tory,  to  a  small  pilot-scale  test,  to  a  larger  pilot-scale  test  for  a  longer  time  period,
to industrial scale (normally five to ten percent of large full-scale utility plants), and
finally to the first operational utility plant. Each of these steps would normally take
on  the  order  of  one  to  three  years,  with  the  whole  process,  assuming  success  at
every  step,  taking  a  total  time  of  anywhere  from  seven  to  fifteen  years.  It  is  also
typical  that  several  different  technology  approaches  proceed  through  these  steps  si-
multaneously  as  competitive  solutions  to  a  given  problem.  For  Southern  Company,
the  time  from  our  initial  pilot-scale  work  on  SCR  in  a  DOE  Clean  Coal  project  to
our  first  commercial  unit  was  over  six  years,  and  it  took  11  years  before  our  first
large  scale  power  plant  SCR  retrofit  was  operational.  A  similar  timeline  for  South-
ern  Company’s  FGD  installations,  and  is  holding  true  for  mercury  control  tech-
nology.  Our  first  test  of  an  activated  carbon  injection  into  a  baghouse  for  mercury
control  occurred  around  1998  at  a  pilot  scale  unit  of  one  MW,  followed  by  a  DOE
sponsored test at 135 MW starting in 2001, and finally to our first full scale project
(880 MW) which started at the end of 2008, a period of 10 years.

We  believe  that  the  timeline  for  the  development  and  demonstration  of  tech-
nologies  for  the  capture  of  CO2 and  the  demonstration  of  sequestration  must  be
compressed  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.  A  combination  of  parallel  develop-
ment  steps  (as  compared  to  the  normal  sequential  steps  described  above)  for  CO2
capture will have to be undertaken to accelerate the technology development. Larger

85

demonstrations  will  need  to  be  initiated  before  the  smaller  scale  tests  have  been
completed.

It  is  also  necessary  to  start  large  scale  sequestration  injection  tests  as  soon  as
possible  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  the  ability  of  this  approach  to  sequester  large
amounts  of  CO2 in  a  safe,  effective,  and  cost  effective  manner.  Ironically,  a  current
complication  of  attempting  to  perform  large  sequestration  projects  is  the  relative
scarcity of CO2 for these tests. There are currently no large scale capture plants in
the  utility  industry  to  supply  the  needed  CO2,  and  most  natural  and  industrial
sources are already in use for the food industry and EOR. Therefore, it becomes nec-
essary to build CO2 capture plants in order to obtain the gas to start these seques-
tration tests.

3.0 Southern Company’s Activities on CCS Technology

Southern  Company  is  active  in  all  of  these  areas  of  technology  development  for
CCS  advancement.  We  are  a  charter  member  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s  re-
gional partnership for our service territory, the Southeast Regional Carbon Seques-
tration Partnership (SECARB). The SECARB partnership covers an eleven-state re-
gion  including  the  States  of  Alabama,  Arkansas,  Florida,  Georgia,  Louisiana,  Mis-
sissippi,  North  Carolina,  South  Carolina,  Tennessee,  Texas,  and  Virginia.  Southern
Company  has  been  a  funding  member  of  SECARB,  and  has  participated  as  a  host
site for a Phase II injection project, and a potential host site for a Phase III injection
project. (The seven Regional Partnerships for carbon sequestration were established
with  funding  by  DOE  to  help  develop  and  demonstrate  the  technology,  equipment,
and  regulations  to  implement  large-scale  CO2 sequestration  in  various  regions  and
geologies across the U.S.)

Through  SECARB,  Southern  Company’s  Plant  Daniel  in  southern  Mississippi
served  as  the  site  for  injection  of  3,000  tons  of  CO2 into  a  saline  formation  at  a
depth of about 8,500 feet below ground level. The purpose of this project was simply
to test the deep saline reservoirs located near the large coal power plants along the
Gulf  Coast  for  geological  sequestration  of  CO2.  This  very  successful  test  has  led  to
SECARB being awarded DOE funding for a larger Phase III project to inject 100,000
to 150,000 tons CO2 per year into similar geological formations at a Southern Com-
pany  plant  located  elsewhere  on  the  Gulf  Coast.  As  mentioned  above,  a  real  dif-
ficulty  in  performing  these  sequestration  tests  is  the  availability  (and  cost)  of  CO2
for  the  injection.  For  the  smaller  injection  of  3,000  tons,  the  CO2 was  contributed
by  Denbury  Resources  who  use  naturally  occurring  CO2 for  EOR  activities.  How-
ever,  for  the  larger  SECARB  Phase  III  injection  program,  that  amount  of  CO2 is
not available.

To  advance  this  larger  scale  sequestration  project  and  to  obtain  the  needed  CO2,
Southern  Company  has  established  a  goal  to  design,  construct,  and  operate  an  in-
dustrial scale CO2 capture process at the generating plant site integrated with a se-
questration  test.  (Southern  Company  has  not  determined  the  actual  plant  site  for
such  a  test,  but  it  would  be  on  the  Gulf  Coast).  Through  partnerships  with  EPRI
and  other  utilities,  Southern  Company’s  goal  is  to  work  towards  retrofitting  this
capture  plant  for  partial  capture  with  one  of  the  leading  technologies  for  CO2 cap-
ture  from  conventional  coal  plants.  The  costs  of  this  capture  plant  would  be  borne
by these private entities. As indicated above, the estimated costs of CO2 capture for
projected  full-scale  installations  are  high  in  capital  and  operating  costs,  and  there-
fore, it is not surprising that pilot and industrial scale test plants are expensive as
well.  The  total  project  costs  for  the  25  MWe  capture  plant  to  supply  the  CO2 for
the Phase III sequestration project of 100,000 to 150,000 tons CO2 per year are esti-
mated  to  be  $140M.  In  the  current  economic  downturn,  it  has  become  a  difficult
challenge  to  raise  the  capital  for  such  a  large  scale  demonstration  project,  and  its
prospects  are  currently  being  evaluated.  We  are  hopeful  that  these  types  of  large
scale  advancement  projects  can  proceed,  but  economic  challenges  stand  to  threaten
our ability to pay for such capture demonstrations—which would of course limit our
ability to test larger scale sequestration such as the SECARB Phase III project.

If  this  25  MW  demonstration  plant  can  be  constructed,  then  we  have  a  further
goal  to  expand  upon  this  capture  and  sequestration  demonstration  with  a  larger
version, designed to reach the MIT goal of one million tons CO2 per year for at least
five  years.  This  proposal  would  involve  building  a  CO2 capture  plant  of  about  170
MWe  size  to  capture  the  needed  one  million  tons  per  year.  Southern  Company  has
applied  for  federal  assistance  on  this  combined  project  in  response  to  both  the  Re-
structured  FutureGen  solicitation  and  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  Round  3
(CCPI 3). DOE has recently announced the intent to reopen CCPI 3 with additional
funding  and  Southern  Company  will  likely  resubmit  an  updated  proposal  in  re-
sponse. The total estimated cost of this 170 MW program would be $750M.

Southern  Company  has  also  been  actively  involved  in  the  development  of  Inte-
grated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  (IGCC)  technology.  Southern’s  subsidiary,  Mis-
sissippi  Power  is  developing  a  full-scale  IGCC  power  plant  of  about  600  MWe  (net)
on  native  lignite  in  east  central  Mississippi,  located  in  Kemper  County.  Mississippi
Power  has  submitted  an  application  to  the  Mississippi  Public  Service  Commission
for  approval  and  is  in  the  environmental  permitting  process.  This  project  has  re-
ceived funding from DOE as an award from CCPI Round 2, as well as having quali-
fied  for  investment  tax  credits  from  Section  48A  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005.
This  new  IGCC  will  also  feature  50  percent  CO2 capture  from  the  startup  of  the
plant, with the captured CO2 being supplied to the oil fields of Mississippi for EOR.
(In addition to EOR recovering more oil from the field, EOR is also a sequestration
technology as the CO2 replaces the oil in the pores of the sandstone, with about half
of the CO2 flood of the oil field remaining underground and therefore being seques-
tered. The CO2 remainder is captured and sent underground again for further EOR
operations.) The Kemper County project has a projected capital cost estimate of ap-
proximately  $2.2  billion.  The  project  is  expected  to  utilize  DOE  CCPI  2  funding  of
about $270M and investment tax credits up to $133M. Pending approval by the Mis-
sissippi Public Service Commission, it is scheduled to come online in late 2013.

Finally,  Southern  Company  has  been  working  in  partnership  with  the  U.S.  DOE
at  the  Power  Systems  Development  Facility  in  Wilsonville,  Alabama.  Originally
dedicated  to  improving  technology  to  advance  the  efficiency  of  particulate  removal
from  high  pressure,  high  temperature  gases,  the  facility  has  been  instrumental  in
developing  and  proving  the  IGCC  technology  that  will  be  used  at  Kemper  County,
one  that  is  well-suited  to  low  rank  coals  which  are  economically  important  to  the
U.S.  economy.  Continuing  this  partnership  with  DOE,  the  facility  will  be  exploring
fundamental  technologies  that  will  improve  or  completely  replace  the  current  tech-
nologies  for  capturing  CO2 from  both  conventional  combustion  coal  power  plants  as
well  as  IGCC  plants.  The  particular  role  for  the  PSDF  in  carbon  capture  will  be  to
assist in transitioning promising technologies from their research laboratory size to
the  power  plant  size  and  environment.  Southern  Company  believes  strongly  that  a
robust  fundamental  research  and  development  program  and  the  associated  means
to  scale  up  promising  technologies  is  vital  to  success  in  commercial  CCS  develop-
ment  and  commercial  deployment—and  the  ability  to  use  the  U.S.  coal  reserves  as
an energy source for the future.

4.0 Challenges Going Forward for CCS

The challenges for CCS going forward are basically cost and timeframes. The costs
of  pilot  and  larger  scale  research  programs  for  CO2 capture  are  much  higher  than
the similar research programs for control of other emissions such as nitrogen oxides
(NOÆ),  sulfur  oxides  (SO2 and  SO3),  and  mercury—in  fact  they  appear  to  be  over
10 times the capital and operating costs of these previous efforts. Given current eco-
nomic  conditions,  the  utility  industry  has  limited  ability  to  self-fund  these  projects
and advance these technologies to get them ready for commercial use.

Commercial  CO2 capture  systems  using  today’s  technology  are  very  costly,  so
much  so  that  the  future  of  coal  as  a  base  energy  source  in  the  utility  sector  is
threatened. The capital costs of a new conventional coal plant with CCS may be as
much  as  50  percent  to  100  percent  higher  than  the  same  coal  power  plant  without
CCS. Operating costs for the energy required for the capture process and CO2 com-
pression make the plant much less efficient than today’s coal plants. For a CO2 cap-
ture plant added to an existing coal power plant, somewhere between 30 and 35 per-
cent  of  the  plant’s  electrical  output  would  be  lost  to  operate  a  90  percent  CO2 cap-
ture  system.  In  other  words,  a  large  900  MWe  power  plant  when  equipped  with  a
CCS  system  would  become  a  650  MWe  plant.  Other  generation—from  coal,  natural
gas,  or  some  other  source—would  have  to  be  built  to  make  up  for  this  lost  genera-
tion.

The timeframe issue is mostly centered on sequestration and the need to perform
large  scale  sequestration  projects  for  multiple  years  to  demonstrate  the  methods,
measurements,  stability,  and  safety  of  this  approach.  In  order  to  gain  acceptance
from  multiple  stakeholders  that  geological  sequestration  is  commercially  viable,  it
is  essential  that  these  large  scale  sequestration  projects  be  started  as  soon  as  pos-
sible.  Assuming  MIT’s  recommendation  of  a  minimum  of  five  years  of  testing,  a
start  today  would  mean  it  would  be  mid-2013  at  the  earliest  before  long-term  deci-
sions on sequestration could be made.

5.0 Next Steps for CCS Technology Development

The  steps  needed  to  advance  CCS  technology  and  improve  its  cost  and  perform-
ance are straightforward: (1) a continuation of the historically successful public-pri-

vate  partnerships  between  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  and  the  utility  industry
in  demonstrating  and  improving  CCS;  (2)  a  strong  focus  on  performing  large  scale
capture  and  sequestration  projects  as  soon  as  possible;  and  (3)  continued  focus  and
funding for fundamental research and development based on cutting-edge science to
develop  new  technologies  and  improve  the  costs  and  performances  of  existing  CCS
technologies.

Southern Company looks forward to working with the Department of Energy, ven-
dors,  and  the  domestic  and  international  utility  industry  to  improve  and  advance
CCS.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  SARAH  M.  FORBES,  SENIOR  ASSOCIATE,
CLIMATE  AND  ENERGY  PROGRAM,  WORLD  RESOURCES  IN-
STITUTE
Ms. FORBES. Good morning and thank you for inviting me to tes-
tify  today.  I  am  Sarah  Forbes,  and  I  lead  the  CO2 Capture  and
Storage  work  at  the  World  Resources  Institute.  The  World  Re-
sources  Institute  is  a  non-profit,  non-partisan  environmental  think
tank that goes beyond research to provide practical solutions to the
world’s most urgent environment and development challenges. The
World Resources Institute has taken the lead in exploring the chal-
lenges,  opportunities  and  state  of  technical  knowledge  in  the  field
of carbon capture and storage.

We  convened  a  two  year  stakeholder  process  which  resulted  in
the  Guidelines  for  Carbon  Dioxide  Capture,  Transport,  and  Stor-
age.  This  report  can  serve  as  a  benchmark  for  decision-makers  to
use in evaluating potential projects.

The  key  finding  of  these  WRI  guidelines  was  that  even  though
additional  research  is  needed  in  some  areas,  there  is  adequate
technical  understanding  to  safely  conduct  large-scale  demonstra-
tions.  In  fact,  many  of  the  remaining  questions  about  CCS  tech-

nology  can  only  be  answered  by  additional  experience  with  the
technology or policy interventions.

Last  July,  the  G8  set  a  goal  of  20  demonstrations  globally  by
2010.  The  U.S.  Climate  Action  Partnership,  of  which  WRI  is  a
member, further recommends building at least five CCS projects in
the United States by 2015. Achieving these goals in the right time
frame  is  critical  to  deal  with  the  looming  climate  challenge  but  at
the  same  time  will  require  significant  investment.  There  is  a  need
for  establishing  a  clear  and  robust  international  financing  mecha-
nism to fund these projects globally. To address this need, Congress
should  consider  committing  funding  for  public/private  partnership
demonstrations  in  the  United  States  and  formally  participate  in
international  demonstration  efforts.  CCS  demonstrations  will  re-
quire  billions  in  research  funding  with  estimates  at  about  $1–1.5
billion per project. Funding allocated in the American Recovery and
Reinvestment  Act  of  2009  is  significant  but  unfortunately  still  falls
short  of  what  will  be  needed  to  commercialize  CCS  technology.  A
robust  funding  mechanism  and  clear  plan  for  collaboration  among
demonstration  projects  internationally  is  critical.  It  is  time  to
evaluate  existing  programs  for  international  collaboration  in  the
context of this emerging suite of global demonstration projects and
to  form  formal  partnerships  with  others  pursing  demonstrations,
the  U.K.,  the  E.U.,  China,  Canada,  and  Australia.  We  also  must
enhance  capacity  for  CCS  demonstrations  in  China.  China’s  coal-
related  carbon  dioxide  emissions  are  projected  to  be  51  percent  of
the world’s total by 2030. Although China is actively developing its
non-carbon power sources, even rapid growth will not be enough to
replace  coal.  Deployment  of  CCS  in  China  may  be  the  only  way  to
globally  make  the  needed  reductions  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions.
China  is  itself  conducting  research  and  quickly  moving  towards
developing  and  demonstrating  CCS  technologies.  In  fact,  the  Chi-
nese  government  was  among  the  foreign  governments  who  had
pledged to commit funding for the original FutureGen project. Chi-
nese  companies  and  government  institutions  are  also  undertaking
a CCS research. For example GreenGen, sponsored by China’s five
largest  power  companies,  will  soon  build  a  200-megawatt  inte-
grated gasification combined cycle power plant with CCS in nearby
depleted oil fields before 2020. Both PetroChina, China’s largest oil
company,  and  Shenhua,  its  largest  coal  company,  have  pilot  CCS
programs with planned injections.

It  would  be  to  the  benefit  of  both  the  U.S.  and  China  if  there
were more direct collaboration on CCS demonstrations. To address
this need, Congress can commit funding for public-private partner-
ship  demonstration  projects  in  the  United  States  and  China  that
would  be  jointly  funded  and  operated.  This  will  require  a  serious
funding  commitment  as  well  as  programs  that  facilitate  informa-
tion  sharing  on  regulatory  and  policy  issues  and  support  for  U.S.
businesses working internationally.

Examples  of  programs  that  would  help  build  increased  capacity
for CCS in China or other emerging economies include research ex-
change  programs  to  bring  students  and  faculty  from  China  to  see
the projects operating in the United States and to study with lead-
ing researchers. An effective near-term approach would be to estab-
lish  a  research  exchange  program  for  visits  to  ongoing  demonstra-

tions  in  the  United  States  including  the  Department  of  Energy’s
Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Partnership  Phase  III  projects.  Ex-
change  programs  for  environmental  regulators  and  policy  experts
may  also  prove  useful  in  resolving  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  social
challenges  of  deploying  CCS  technology.  The  Department  of  State
in  collaboration  with  the  Department  of  Energy  have  implemented
successful exchange programs in the past which could be replicated
with a focus on CCS technology and policy.

Recently, as Dr. Finley mentioned, with support from the Depart-
ment  of  State’s  Asia  Pacific  Partnership,  Tsinghua  University  in
China has partnered with WRI on an effort to draft a set of guide-
lines for safe and effective CCS in China, like the report we did for
the  United  States.  This  work  will  be  influential  in  developing  Chi-
nese CCS regulation and policy.

In  conclusion,  globally,  CCS  has  progressed  to  the  point  of  dem-
onstration-readiness, and there is a race under way to see who will
build  the  world’s  first  large-scale  integrated  demonstration.  In-
creased  coordinated  international  collaborations  are  essential.  We
need to specifically partner with emerging economics like China in
demonstrating  CCS  technology  through  joint  public-private  part-
nerships. In these international collaborations, we must seek ways
to  build  capacity  and  support  efforts  to  develop  global  policies  and
environmental  regulations  that  protect  human  health  and  eco-
systems.  This  will  include  coordination  and  collaboration  on  dem-
onstration that beings in the planning stages together with projects
that build capacity on regulatory and policy issues. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SARAH M. FORBES

Good  morning  and  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  today.  I  am  Sarah  Forbes
and  I  lead  the  CO2 Capture  and  Storage  (CCS)  work  at  the  World  Resources  Insti-
tute.  The  World  Resources  Institute  is  a  non-profit,  non-partisan  environmental
think  tank  that  goes  beyond  research  to  provide  practical  solutions  to  the  world’s
most urgent environment and development challenges. We work in partnership with
scientists,  businesses,  governments,  and  non-governmental  organizations  in  more
than  seventy  countries  to  provide  information,  tools  and  analysis  to  address  prob-
lems  like  climate  change,  and  the  degradation  of  ecosystems  and  their  capacity  to
provide for human well-being.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) has taken a lead in exploring the challenges,
opportunities  and  state  of  technical  knowledge  in  the  field  of  carbon  capture  and
storage.  We  convened  a  two  year  stakeholder  process  which  resulted  in  the  Guide-
lines for Carbon Dioxide Capture, Transport, and Storage (http://www.wri.org/pub-
lication/ccs-guidelines)  published  in  November  2008  which  can  serve  as  a  bench-
mark  for  decision-makers  to  use  in  evaluating  potential  projects.  In  developing  the
Guidelines, WRI brought together a diverse group of more than 80 technical experts
including government officials, NGOs, academics and businesses.

Coal  use  is  responsible  for  over  40  percent  of  global  carbon  dioxide  emissions.1
Without  significant,  deliberate  action  to  reduce  these  emissions  we  cannot  address
climate  change.  Carbon  capture  and  storage  is  one  of  a  number  of  critical  tech-
nologies  coal-burning  nations  will  need  to  consider  and  deploy  in  the  coming  dec-
ades.  International  collaboration  will  be  essential  to  moving  CCS  technology  to
scale—reducing costs and securing a global response to the climate challenge. In the
next five years, we must move from demonstration to deployment.

In  this  testimony,  I  will  provide  an  update  on  some  of  the  key  international  col-
laborations  on  CCS  already  underway,  and  offer  some  ideas  for  future  direction.  I
would like to make three key points, each of which I will expand on below.

First, I will describe the urgent need for a global network of CCS demonstrations
that includes joint technology development along with collaboration on resolving in-
vestment, regulatory, legal and social barriers to CCS deployment.

Second,  I  will  talk  specifically  about  collaboration  on  CCS  with  one  country—
China.  I  will  describe  the  efforts  many  countries  and  businesses  are  taking  to  en-
sure that at least one of the global CCS demonstrations is in China.

Third, I will describe a few of the major international CCS collaborations that are
underway  and  offer  suggestions  for  how  these  efforts  may  best  complement  each
other as the technology is demonstrated worldwide.

I  will  conclude  by  providing  some  concrete  suggestions  for  near-term  actions  that
can be taken to enhance collaborations with China and facilitate global deployment
of CCS technology.

1. Develop a Global Network of CCS Demonstrations

In technology development there is a period known as the ‘‘Valley of Death’’ where
a  technology  has  been  proven  in  the  laboratory  and  at  a  small  scale  but  has  yet
to move from a research effort to commercialization. CCS technology has progressed
quickly from an idea to a key part in proposed climate change mitigation plans. This
progression  is  partly  thanks  to  the  early  successes  seen  in  the  pilot  capture  dem-
onstrations  and  research  and  commercial  projects  where  CO2 has  been  injected  at
rates  up  to  a  million  tons  per  year.  Moving  the  technology  forward  into  commer-
cialization will require integrated capture and storage demonstration at power plant
scale.  A  key  finding  of  the  Guidelines  for  Carbon  Dioxide  Capture,  Transport,  and
Storage  (http://www.wri.org/publication/ccs-guidelines)  was  that  even  though  ad-
ditional research is needed in some areas, there is adequate technical understanding
to  safely  conduct  large-scale  demonstrations.  In  fact,  many  of  the  remaining  ques-
tions about CCS technology can only be answered by additional experience with the
technology or policy interventions.

Most  experts  agree  that  we  need  between  15  and  20  demonstrations  of  differing
capture and storage configurations globally. Last July, the G8 set a goal of 20 dem-
onstrations  announced  by  2010.2 The  U.S.  Climate  Action  Partnership,  of  which
WRI  is  a  member,  (USCAP)3 further  recommends  building  at  least  five  projects  of
CCS  enabled  coal  fueled  facilities  in  the  United  States  by  2015  (see  www.US-
CAP.org).

Achieving  these  goals  in  the  right  time  frame  is  critical  to  deal  with  the  looming
climate  challenge  but  at  the  same  time  will  require  significant  investment.  There
is  a  need  for  establishing  a  clear  and  robust  international  financing  mechanism  to
fund  these  projects  globally.  It  will  also  require  substantial  (but  not  insurmount-
able)  progress  on  addressing  lingering  regulatory,  investment,  legal,  and  social
issues. The global development of environmental regulatory frameworks for CCS, is
testament  to  our  readiness  to  demonstrate  the  technology.  In  2008,  regulatory
frameworks for CCS were released at the State and federal level in the U.S.4,5 and
Australia6 and  a  Directive  for  CCS,  which  included  environmental  regulations,  was
passed at the European Union7 level. Global progression towards a common under-
standing of how to safely implement the technology seems within reach.

This effort of building a global network of CCS demonstrations will require a sig-
nificant investment and commitment of resources, along with coordination and sup-
port from senior government representatives. However, through strong international
collaboration  each  country  need  not  demonstrate  the  full  suite  of  capture  and  stor-
age options. For example, when the UK first announced their plans to move forward
with  a  post-combustion  CCS  demonstration,  it  was  described  as  being  complimen-
tary to the U.S. FutureGen project which was at that time planning to demonstrate
at-scale capture with an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant.8 The

collective  group  of  global  demonstrations  should  include  the  full  suite  of  different
capture configurations and test storage in a variety of geologic settings.

To address this need, Congress can commit funding for public-private partnership
demonstration  projects  in  the  U.S.  and  formally  participate  in  international  dem-
onstration efforts. CCS demonstrations will require billions in research funding with
estimates at about $1–1.5 billion per project. Funding allocated in the American Re-
covery  and  Reinvestment  Act  of  2009  is  important,  but  still  falls  short  of  what  will
be needed to commercialize CCS technology. A robust funding mechanism and clear
plan for collaboration among demonstration projects is critical. One example of such
a  plan  was  recently  approved  by  the  European  Union  with  funding  for  demonstra-
tions  coming  from  the  proceeds  the  European  Trading  Scheme  (ETS)  and  coordina-
tion  among  projects  required.9 The  global  CCS  demonstration  network  should  in-
clude  collaborative  work  on  not  only  technology  development,  but  also  information-
sharing on legal, social and regulatory issues.

2. Enhance Capacity for CCS Demonstration in China

According  to  the  Energy  Information  Administration,  China’s  coal-related  carbon
dioxide  emissions  may  grow  to  51  percent  of  the  world’s  total  by  2030.10 With  20
percent of the world’s population, China has 14 percent of the world’s coal reserves,
but less than one percent of the world’s oil and gas reserves. While China is actively
developing  its  non-carbon  power  sources—hydropower,  nuclear,  and  newer  alter-
native energies—rapid growth will still not be enough to replace coal as a core part
of its expanding electricity infrastructure. Deployment of CCS in China may be the
only way to globally make the needed reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.

China  is  conducting  research  and  quickly  moving  towards  developing  and  dem-
onstrating  CCS  technologies.  In  fact,  the  Chinese  government  was  among  the  for-
eign  governments  who  had  pledged  to  commit  funding  for  the  original  FutureGen
project.11 Chinese  companies  and  government  institutions  are  undertaking  a  CCS
research themselves and with a number of international partners. For example:

• The Chinese power industry has several projects focusing on coal gasification.
The  largest,  GreenGen,  sponsored  by  China’s  five  largest  power  companies,
will build a 200 MW integrated gasification combined cycle power plant in the
city  of  Tianjin.  Phases  two  and  three  of  this  project  plan  for  CCS  in  nearby
depleted  oil  fields,  with  injection  planned  before  2020.  U.S.  Peabody  Energy
is the one international equity partner in this effort.
• China  has  two  major  efforts  with  European  collaborators,  the  UK–China
Near-Zero  Emissions  Coal  Project12 (NZEC)  and  the  COoperation  Action
within  CCS  CHina-EU13 (COACH)  Project.  Both  have  done  a  great  deal  of
preparatory and conceptual work on CCS.
• China’s  Huaneng  group  built  a  small  carbon  capture  demonstration  plant  at
Gaobeidian  in  Beijing  with  assistance  from  Australia’s  Commonwealth  Sci-
entific  and  Industrial  Research  Organization  (CSIRO).  Discussions  about  a
second phase are in process.
• Both  PetroChina,  China’s  largest  oil  company,  and  Shenhua,  its  largest  coal

company, have pilot CCS programs.

There  is  also  a  realization  in  China  that  robust  policies  and  regulations  will  be
needed  to  ensure  that  CCS  projects  are  done  responsibly.  Tsinghua  University  has
partnered  with  WRI  to  draft  a  set  of  Guidelines  for  Safe  and  Effective  CCS  in
China.  The  effort  is  modeled  after  the  stakeholder  process  led  by  WRI  in  the  U.S.
where a diverse set of stakeholders together developed a comprehensive set of guide-
lines  for  CCS  projects  (http://www.wri.org/publication/ccs-guidelines).  Develop-
ment of a Guidelines document that is available in Chinese for potential project op-
erators, financiers, insurers, and legal experts to as a tool in understanding how to
conduct  CCS  projects  responsibly  will  facilitate  demonstration  of  the  technology  in
China. To enable this effort, Tsinghua University and WRI have assembled a steer-
ing committee that includes leading CCS experts from China and the United States.

9 The EU recently adopted a legal framework for CCS and also provided funding mechanisms
through auction allowances and the EU stimulus recovery package http://www.scotland.gov.uk/

The  Chinese  members  of  the  steering  committee  recently  traveled  to  the  United
States  and  toured  some  of  the  leading  CCS  research  institutions  (including  the  in-
jection  well  being  drilled  in  Illinois).  This  effort  is  being  funded  with  support  from
the U.S. Department of State under the Asia Pacific Partnership.14

It  would  be  to  the  benefit  of  both  the  U.S.  and  China  if  there  were  more  direct
collaboration  on  CCS  demonstrations.  Not  only  would  working  together  solve  tech-
nical  problems  faster,  but  given  the  rate  at  which  Chinese  companies  are  moving,
the learning would hardly be one way. Jointly-funded and operated demonstrations,
that  include  government  funding  combined  with  private-sector  investment  is  an  es-
sential  next  step.  This  will  require  a  serious  funding  commitment  as  well  as  pro-
grams  that  facilitate  information  sharing  on  regulatory  and  policy  issues  and  sup-
port for U.S. businesses working internationally.

Examples of programs that would help build increased capacity for CCS in China
or other emerging economies include research exchange programs to bring students
and faculty from China to see projects operating in the U.S. and study with leading
researchers.  An  effective  near-term  approach  would  be  to  establish  a  research  ex-
change  program  for  visits  to  ongoing  demonstrations  in  the  U.S.  including  the  De-
partment  of  Energy’s  Regional  Sequestration  Partnership  Phase  III  projects.  Ex-
change  programs  for  environmental  regulators  and  policy  experts  may  also  prove
useful  in  resolving  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  social  challenges  of  deploying  CCS
technology.  The  Department  of  State  in  collaboration  with  the  Department  of  En-
ergy has implemented successful exchange programs in the past which could be rep-
licated with a focus on CCS technology and policy.

3. Key International CCS Collaborations Underway

There  are  several  high-level  international  CCS  efforts  underway,  along  with  nu-
merous individual projects like the WRI–Tsinghua University effort I just described.
Each  of  these  efforts  can  play  an  important  role  in  the  development  of  the  tech-
nology. Key to successful integration of these efforts will be clarifying the niche each
effort is designed to fill, eliminating redundancies, and designing a path for collabo-
ration.

I would like to highlight three key CCS-specific initiatives already underway:

1. The  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum15 (CSLF)  is  a  Ministerial-level
effort initiated by the U.S. Department of Energy. It has been in place since
2003 and has been influential in collaborations among governments.

2. Australia  has  recently  initiated  a  Global  CCS  Institute,16 for  which  the
Prime Minister has allocated $100M per year for the next 10 years. This in-
stitute  is  designed  to  focus  specifically  on  collaboration  surrounding  dem-
onstration projects.

3. The  International  Energy  Agency17 (IEA)  coordinates  international  research
through the IEA GHG Program. IEA Secretariat is also developing an inter-
national  roadmap  for  CCS  at  the  request  of  the  G–8.  This  roadmap  is  de-
signed  to  answer  the  question  of  whether  and  how  we  can  achieve  the  goal
of  20  CCS  demonstrations  announced  globally  by  2010  and  will  provide  rec-
ommendations for better coordination among international collaborations.

As  the  technology  progresses  from  R&D  towards  demonstration,  these  inter-
national efforts can provide an avenue for information-sharing at various levels: the
CSLF at the ministerial-level, the IEA among government energy departments, and
the  Global  Institute  among  those  running  demonstration  projects.  It  is  time  to
evaluate  the  existing  programs  in  the  context  of  an  emerging  suite  of  global  dem-
onstration  projects  and  to  form  formal  partnerships  with  others  perusing  dem-
onstrations  (UK,  EU,  China,  Canada,  Australia).  Congress  might  consider  commis-
sioning  a  formal  report  on  international  CCS  efforts  and  use  the  results  of  it  along
with  the  IEA’s  International  CCS  Roadmap  (expected  publication  date  October
2009)18 to  clarify  and  formalize  the  role  of  the  various  international  CCS  organiza-
tions  that  have  emerged.  Additionally,  although  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s
Regional  Partnership  Program  has  been  acknowledged  as  the  ‘‘world’s  most  ambi-
tious  program’’ 19 the  work  is  largely  unknown  in  the  international  community,  in

part  because  it  is  difficult  for  researchers  to  receive  approval  to  travel  internation-
ally  on  their  government  grants.  A  scholarship  program  for  U.S.  researchers  work-
ing  on  government-funded  projects  to  attend  international  CCS  meetings  and
present the results of their research may be useful in better communicating the re-
sults  of  leading  U.S.  research  in  this  area.  Such  a  merit-based  program  could  be
managed through the Department of Energy. Formal arrangements to partner with
other countries on demonstrations must be established soon.

Conclusions

Unless  we  act  now  to  aggressively  begin  to  implement  a  global  CCS  demonstra-
tion  program,  we  will  lock  in  untold  additional  quantities  of  CO2 emissions  from
non-CCS,  coal-fired  power  plants  around  the  world.  Globally,  CCS  R&D  has  pro-
gressed to the point of demonstration-readiness and there is a race underway to see
who  will  build  the  world’s  first  large-scale  integrated  demonstration  of  capture,
transport,  and  storage  along  with  power  production.  The  global  nature  of  climate
change  and  the  urgent  need  to  act  now  to  avoid  locking  in  a  high  emissions  trajec-
tory  for  the  future  necessitates  increased  and  coordinated  international  collabora-
tions.  We  need  to  specifically  partner  with  emerging  economies  on  demonstrating
CCS  technology,  through  joint  public-private  partnerships.  In  these  international
collaborations  we  must  seek  ways  to  build  capacity  and  support  efforts  to  develop
global  policies  and  environmental  regulations  that  protect  human  health  and  eco-
systems. This will include coordination and collaboration on demonstrations that be-
gins in the planning stages along with projects that build capacity on regulatory and
policy issues (like the WRI–Tsinghua APP project).

In my testimony, I have mentioned five specific actions to consider that will help

facilitate international collaboration on CCS, which are summarized here:

1. Commit funding for demonstration projects in the U.S. and in China that are
geared towards joint technology development; such projects should be public-
private  partnerships.  The  global  network  of  demonstrations  should  include
the  full  suite  of  capture  technology  approaches  and  test  storage  in  a  variety
of geologic settings.

2. Develop  a  framework  and  funding  for  research  exchange  programs  to  bring
researchers  from  other  countries  to  see  projects  operating  in  the  U.S.  and
study  with  leading  researchers.  The  Department  of  State  in  collaboration
with  the  Department  of  Energy  has  implemented  successful  exchange  pro-
grams in the past which could be replicated with a focus on CCS technology
and policy.

3. Increase bilateral efforts to facilitate capacity building and information shar-

ing on regulatory and policy issues.

4. Establish  formal  partnerships  with  other  countries  developing  CCS  dem-
onstration  projects  (UK,  EU,  China,  and  Australia)  to  facilitate  information-
sharing and avoid duplication among demonstration efforts. Also, commission
a  formal  report  on  international  CCS  efforts  and  use  the  results  of  it  and
the IEA CCS Roadmap to clarify and formalize the role of the various inter-
national CCS organizations that have emerged.

5. Develop a scholarship program for U.S. researchers working on government-
funded projects to attend international CCS meetings and present the results
of their research. Such a merit-based program could be managed through the
Department of Energy.

DISCUSSION

COST ESCALATIONS

Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  Chairman  thanks  you,  Ms.  Forbes.  Let  me
begin  questioning.  I  think  the  Chairman  of  the  Full  Committee,
Chairman Gordon, stepped out. When he returns, he has questions
I  know,  but  let  me  begin,  Mr.  Gaffigan,  with  your  testimony,  and
I  think  you  touched  on  this  but  I  would  like  you  to  elaborate.  In
your analysis of the restructured FutureGen, did you find that the
cost escalation used by the Department of Energy to justify the re-
structuring  and  scrapping  the  initial  FutureGen  plan  to  go  with  a
restructured program valid?

94

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  We  asked  over  and  over  for  analysis  behind  the
cost  estimate.  We  found  it  was  pretty  much  a  straightforward  5.2
percent escalation factor. We pointed out that there are others that
point  out  that  you’re  not  going  to  see  that  sustained  growth  in  es-
calation  factors.  And  in  fact,  EIA  had  pointed  that  out,  that  even
at  the  time  we  were  looking  at  a  lot  of  cost  escalations,  look  at  us
today  in  terms  of  the  concerns  about  whether  there  is  going  to  be
that cost escalation and whether there was going to be jobs for peo-
ple  because  the  economy  was  slowing  down.  So  that  is  the  point
made. And that in looking at the total number, you know, very well
you could see cost escalation, but we did not see any in-depth anal-
ysis and we didn’t see a good explanation for why they talked about
doubling  of  costs  when,  in  fact,  it  was  comparing  some  constant
dollars to escalated dollars.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  And  that  is  a  very  important  point  in  one  of  our
Subcommittee  hearings  concerning  this  issue  and  the  cost  esca-
lation,  the  reason  used  by  the  Department  of  Energy  to  scrap  the
project. Without question, the cost did increase, but when you look
at  other  projects  around  the  country  and  look  at  the  cost  of  build-
ing materials, look at the cost of labor, the increases from the time
the  project  was  planned  and  the  projected  costs  were  arrived  at,
they  were  no  different  than  any  other  project  of  that  size.  Would
that be something that you would agree with?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  I  would  agree  with  that,  and  the  other  thing  I
would point out is that the Alliance was working on a revised cost
estimate based on a specific site. It is important to point out these
estimates were very preliminary, but they had targeted to do a cost
estimate  in  June  of  ’08.  The  question  we  raised  is  what  was  the
cost  and  sort  of  not  waiting  to  see  what  that  cost  estimate  would
have  been.  A  newer  estimate  would  have  reflected  the  site-specific
type activities, and it seemed like it was never considered.

Mr. COSTELLO. And of course, since the decision was made to pull
the plug on the initial project as planned, the fact that we have lost
time  now,  that  has  increased  the  cost  of  whatever  project  that  we
move  forward  with.  If  it  is  a  scaled-back  version  or  if  we  would  go
back  to  the  original  proposal,  we  have  increased  cost  because  we
have lost time and would you agree with that?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Well,  you  know,  we  didn’t  look  at  a  specific  cost
estimate relative to that, but I would say there is definitely an op-
portunity  cost  of  not  going  forward.  That  being  said,  I  think  it  is
important to recognize that cost escalation does happen. In the De-
partment  of  Energy,  there  is  a  history  of  cost  escalation.  In  fact,
if  cost  escalation  was  the  criteria  for  going  forward  with  projects
at  the  Department  of  Energy,  FutureGen  wouldn’t  be  the  only  one
that would have been canceled.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  I  thank  you.  Dr.  Der,  let  me  ask,  at  the  time
when  the  Administration  back  then  made  the  decision  to  pull  the
plug, one of the things that they were attempting to do was to ne-
gotiate  with  the  Alliance  on  cost  share,  that  they  wanted  the  pri-
vate  sector  in  the  Alliance  to  come  up  with  a  higher  percentage  of
the  cost  of  the  project  than  originally  proposed.  We  were  told  by
the  Alliance  that  that  was  negotiable,  that  they  in  fact  would  sit
down  and  discuss  with  the  Department  of  Energy  a  higher  cost
share. Is that your understanding?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:25 Sep 20, 2009 Jkt 047719 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\E&E09\031109\47719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

95

Dr.  DER.  My  understanding  was  that  such  discussions  were  tak-
ing place, and it is my understanding also that the Department did
not  feel  that  at  that  time  that  these  were  moving  forward  in  a
fruitful, sustainable manner as I was told.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Just  for  the  record,  the  Alliance  told  us  just  the
opposite,  that  they  in  fact  were  willing  to  negotiate,  were  willing
to  increase  their  cost  share,  but  the  Administration  and  the  De-
partment  of  Energy  at  the  time  had  basically  made  the  decision
that they were going to scrap, pull the plug on their initial concept
and were not earnest in trying to negotiate a higher cost share. But
the Alliance was willing to increase their cost share.

LESSONS FROM SMALL-SCALE PROJECTS

One  other  question  and  then  I  will  ask  Chairman  Gordon  if  he
has  questions.  Dr.  Finley,  what  important  lessons  have  been
learned  from  the  small-scale  field  project  that  the  injection  project
initiated by the consortium and the validation of its efforts?

Dr.  FINLEY.  Well,  I  believe  what  we  have  been  able  to  show  is
that  the  study  that  was  based  on  existing  data  from  2003  to  2005
during  our  Phase  I  effort,  that  data  were  largely  validated  in  the
sense that the thickness of the receiving reservoir over a wide area
of the Illinois basin is over 1,000 feet thick. That both includes our
test sites and it includes the FutureGen site at Decatur, and at the
reservoir seal, the geology of that seal looks competent over a wide
area  of  literally  thousands  of  square  miles.  So  what  we  basically
have  validated  in  our  efforts  is  that  the  geological  characteristics
of  the  area  of  our  regional  sequestration  partnership  and  because
that is coincident with the Mattoon FutureGen site, that geology is
very favorable for geological carbon sequestration.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Thank  you.  The  Chairman  now  recognizes  the

Chairman of the Full Committee, Chairman Gordon.

Chair  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Costello.  I  know  this  is  an  issue
that  is  close  to  your  heart,  and  this  is  a  very  important  issue  and
a very good panel, and I thank you all for being here.

JUSTIFYING RESEARCH FUNDS

Mr.  Gaffigan,  your  report  clearly  points  out  that  the  DOE  was
comparing  two  cost  estimates  that  were  just  not  comparable.  You
know,  unfortunately,  we  have  run  into  this  in  other  types  of  R&D
projects  which  makes  it  difficult  to  go  back  to  the  public  and  say
we  need  more  money  when  these  things  aren’t  clear.  What  should
the  Department  do  and  what  should  Congress  require  them  to  do
to improve this situation?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Well,  you  know,  contracting  in  the  government
and  DOE  in  particular  has  been  an  area  that  we  have  focused  on.
In  fact,  contracting  at  DOE  is  considered  a  high  risk  for  us  and
particularly in the weapons side of the house, and I think we have
identified  certain  things  that  are  important  in  terms  of  controlling
costs and managing projects. And it sort of starts at the top, a com-
mitment  to  schedule,  having  the  right  people  involved  there  and
contracting  the  resources,  and  the  commitment  to  measure
progress along the way for these projects.

We  have  found,  for  example,  in  the  Office  of  Science  that  they
have made great progress in this area and overcome some of these
issues associated with the major projects.

Chair  GORDON.  So  you  are  trying  to  make  me  feel  better  when

we do this again?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Well,  I  mean,  look.  These  things  are  high  risk.  I
mean,  even  FutureGen  is  a  high-risk  issue,  and  that  is  why  the
government is sort of stepping in to try to help in partnership with
the private sector to share that risk.

Chair  GORDON.  Well,  that  is  the  next  point  I  want  to  get  to.  Is

this type of project being done anywhere else now?

Mr. GAFFIGAN. Not that I am aware of.
Chair GORDON. And as we see climate change legislation looming
over us, would this not be an important tool in our box to move for-
ward  if  we  are  going  to  continue,  which  I  think  we  have  to,  with
coal-fired plants?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  I  think  absolutely.  I  think  it  is  one  of  the  issues
addressing  the  technology  barriers.  I  would  also  point  out  that
there  are  other  issues  that  need  to  be  considered  in  concert  with
that,  including  the  regulatory  and  legal  framework  with  carbon
capture  and  storage  as  well  as  what  are  we  going  to  do  about  car-
bon?  Are  we  going  to  be  able  to  send  a  signal  to  the  market?  Be-
cause  ultimately,  we  could  put  all  the  money  we  want  into  these
projects,  and  we  testified  last  year  that  the  government  has  spent
over $60 billion, or close to $60 billion over the last 30 years in ad-
vanced energy technologies, yet we are still heavily reliant on con-
ventional fossil fuels. And it can’t just be the government spending
money, it has got to consider the context of the private market.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

Chair  GORDON.  Ms.  Forbes,  if  I  could  pontificate  a  little  bit  on
a  pet  project  of  mine.  These  are  going  to  be  very  expensive  pro-
grams,  carbon  capture  and  sequestration,  and  these  are  times  of
limited  resources.  It  seems  to  me  that  we  should  follow  up  on  a
proposal that was made at the G–8, I guess it was last year, to do
an  international  type  of  cooperation  with  this.  Particularly  in  this
area  and  energy  in  general,  I  sort  of  see  it  as  ‘‘them  that  have  it
and  them  that  don’t,’’  and  we  are  in  the  don’t  category  and  that
particularly  with  coal,  where  we  have  so  much  coal  in  contrast  to
oil  and  gas,  that  we  should  look  at  some  type  of  international  co-
operation in terms of sharing both the intellectual part of it as well
as  the  financial  part,  maybe  take  different  geological  formations
that  one  country  might  have,  we  would  take  a  couple  here,  some-
place else there. Is that reasonable and could you elaborate on that
some for me, pros and cons?

Ms. FORBES. Yes. I think that we have some existing frameworks
for  international  collaboration  on  this  subject.  One  of  the  things
that  is  happening  right  now  is  that  at  the  request  of  the  G8,  the
International  Energy  Agency  is  developing  an  international  road-
map  for  CCS.  I  think  that  document  is  set  to  be  released  in  Octo-
ber.  It  will  be  significant,  and  it  will  outline  the  global  suite  of
demonstrations  that  are  in  various  stages  of  planning,  but  yes,  I
agree with you. We need to work globally.

Chair  GORDON.  Yes.  Will  it  help  lead  to  any  kind  of  a  contract
or  treaty  where  there  will  be  coordination  and  cooperation  in  this
effort, or is it just give a new menu of what is going on now?

Ms. FORBES. The roadmap will be a document. It will outline how
to  get  to  the  20  demonstrations  by  2020.  I  think  that  beyond  the
roadmap,  we  need  to  revisit  some  of  the  existing  bilateral  agree-
ments  with  individual  countries  and  form  new  partnerships  where
warranted to collaborate specifically on demonstration.

Chair  GORDON.  And  is  G8  the  best  vehicle  for  that  or  is  there

any other vehicle that you would recommend?

Ms.  FORBES.  I  am  not  sure,  but  I  would  be  happy  to  get  back  to

you on that.

Chair  GORDON.  It  seems  to  me  that  at  the  end  of  the  day,  and
again this will be expensive, it is going to have to be head of state
to  head  of  state  making  the  agreement  and  the  commitment  be-
cause  it  will  have  budgetary  impacts.  Then  you  are  going  to  have
to  have  again  some  vehicle  to  coordinate  that.  So  I  would  appre-
ciate if you would give me any of your thoughts.

Ms. FORBES. Thank you. We will do that analysis.
Chair GORDON. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon.  Just  for  the
record, let me state that Ms. Forbes has indicated that the original
concept and project that was proposed had a lot of international in-
terest  from  China,  India,  Australia,  and  a  number  of  other  coun-
tries  who  pledged  money  and  were  willing  to  cooperate  and  work
with us. When it comes back to my turn for a second round of ques-
tioning, I want to talk a little bit about that and how the fact that
the  previous  Administration,  when  they  pulled  the  plug  on  this,
how  our  international  partners  were  notified  and  if  in  fact  we  can
bring  them  back  to  the  table  and  have  them  work  with  the  Alli-
ance.

The  Chairman  now  recognizes  the  Ranking  Member  of  the  Sub-

committee, Mr. Inglis.

PROJECT SCALE

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Monroe,  I  think  you
had  the  key  word  here  that  I  have  heard,  and  that  is  scalability.
So  I  am  wondering,  the  projects  that  Southern  Company  is  doing
which are very exciting, what percentage of the CO2 emissions are
involved  there?  Do  you  have  any  idea?  They  are  big  numbers  in
terms of sequestration there, but in terms of the percentage of the
outflow, what would it be? Do you have any idea?

Mr.  MONROE.  They  are  fairly  modest.  With  the  exception  of  the
new  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  plant  I  mentioned  in
Mississippi  which  would  be  50  percent  of  600  megawatts,  so  that
is  significant.  The  other  projects  are  really  taking  a  stair  step  ap-
proach.  In  the  utility  business  and  with  our  cooperation  with  the
Department  of  Energy,  we  found  that  if  we  try  to  take  too  big  of
a  step,  we  make  too  many  mistakes.  We  tried  to  sort  of  step  in  a
factor  of  10  almost,  so  we  are  talking  sequestration  or  size.  So  the
two  projects  I  mentioned,  the  first  one  a  25-megawatt,  the  second
one,  170  megawatts  are  fairly  small  by  power  plant  standards.  So
our largest power plant is 3,600 megawatts. So that roughly is only
about  five  percent  at  the  largest  scale  we  are  talking  there.  Some

98

of  the  actual  plants  that  we  would  be  looking  at  would  be  any-
where  from  30  percent  to  say  10  percent  of  the  total  plant  output
at the largest scale that I mentioned on the existing plants.

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  am  also  excited  for  parochial  reasons  to  hear  that
you  are  interested  in  the  IGCC  because  General  Electric  is  in
Greenville,  South  Carolina,  and  that  may  help  business  there  and
other  places.  I  am  very  excited  about  that,  and  it  is  very  exciting
technology.  And  so  now  I  am  going  to  ask  a  question  against  my
own interest. Why would Southern Company be interested in doing
that?  It  is  more  expensive  than  sort  of  a  conventional  coal-fired
plant, right? Are you just good citizens?

Mr.  MONROE.  We  really  see  the  future  as  being  one  that  we  ex-
pect limitations on carbon emissions, particularly for our sector. So
to  try  to  sort  of  smooth  that  transition,  to  try  to  service  our  cus-
tomers  as  reliably  as  possible,  we  are  spending  more  money  for
that generation than it would be for the alternative.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION CHALLENGES

Mr.  INGLIS.  Do  you  have  any  trouble  with  the  PSC,  Public  Serv-
ice  Commission,  getting  that  approval?  I  hope  not,  but  something
tells  me  you  might,  and  this  is  one  of  the  issues  that  Duke  is  en-
countering  in  South  Carolina.  You  know,  you  deal  with  nuclear,  it
is  a  great  way  to  make  electricity,  but  getting  it  through  the  PSC
can  be  really  difficult  because  it  sure  is  cheap  to  make  coal-fired
electricity.

Mr.  MONROE.  Yes.  On  the  project  in  Mississippi,  we  have  asked.
In  mid-January  we  had  submitted  the  request  for  their  consider-
ation for their approval of that. We do have a little bit of help there
in  the  fact  that  our  CO2 will  actually  be—we  can  sell  that  to  oil
producers in Mississippi so that we are not paying to do a geologi-
cal  sequestration  test  but  actually  selling  it.  It  will  eventually  be
sequestered in those enhanced oil recovery operation, but that is a
benefit there.

Mr.  INGLIS.  It  makes  economics  work  a  little  bit  better  for  you

there.

Mr. MONROE. But still not compelling, so that the Public Service
Commission  is  still  one  that  is  very  much  up  in  the  air  for  that
plant.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Got  you.  Interesting.  Of  course,  those  economics
would change, I take it, if there was a price attached to carbon, ei-
ther through what I would like to see as a revenue neutral carbon
tax  or  cap-and-trade.  Either  one  would  cause  those  economics  to
change,  I  suppose,  and  the  Public  Service  Commission  would  be
more easily convinced I suppose?

Mr.  MONROE.  Yes,  we  do  see  that  changing.  Our  fear  and  the
reason  we  are  pushing  so  strongly  now  for  technology  is  that  we
are  afraid  of  a  dash-to-gas  so  to  speak.  So  if  you  run  the  numbers
right  now,  we  need  more  electricity  generation,  natural  gas  is  the
one  that  falls  out  when  you  put  all  the  numbers  down  on  the
paper.  So  we  think  that  we  have  to  do  this  sort  of  work  both  sort
of at scale and go back to universities, national labs, in cooperation
with  utility  companies,  to  see  if  we  can  find  new  technologies  to
make  that  cost  differential  so  that  coal  becomes  one  choice  that  is
still valid in the future.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  I  am  very  excited  to  hear  about  Southern  Com-
pany’s  commitment  to  this  kind  of  research.  I  had  an  unfortunate
meeting one time with a utility that will go nameless that told me
that  they  didn’t  have  an  R&D  department,  and  they  seemed  sort
of  proud  of  it  that  they  didn’t  have  one.  And  I  guess  it  is  because
they  didn’t  want  to  say  to  the  PSC  that  we  got  all  this  in  our  cost
structure, but hats off to you all for wanting to pursue the answer
and  somehow  getting  the  PSCs  in  various  places  to  agree  that  it
is okay to pay all those people.

Mr.  MONROE.  It  is  part  of  our  personality,  and  we  take  a  lot  of
pride in the fact that we have a very active, very aggressive—some
of  the  international  cooperation  that  was  mentioned  earlier,  on
some of these projects we have talked to people in Sweden, in Den-
mark,  in  Germany,  Japan,  and  England  about  participating  in  our
project  and  sharing  information  there.  So  the  benefit  of  having  a
research staff and active organization is you can reach out and find
these technologies.

Mr. INGLIS. Great. Thank you.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  Chairman  thanks  the  gentleman  and  now

recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. Luja´n.

PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY

Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and thank you
for  putting  this  hearing  together.  Doctor,  you  opened  up  your  re-
marks and you made a reference to being responsible and sustain-
able.  Can  you  refresh  my  memory  on  what  you  said  in  that  con-
text?

Dr. DER. I think the context was in the use of coal being environ-
mentally  sustainable  and  responsible  in  terms  of  its  use,  and  that
relates to the emissions and the carbon aspects of it.
Mr. LUJA´ N. And Dr. Der, would you agree that as we are talking
about the future generation of energy in the United States as well
as  around  the  world,  that  that  is  really  a  concept  that  we  should
adopt and embrace as we are moving forward with the generation?
Dr. DER. I believe so.
Mr.  LUJA´ N.  Is  there  anyone  on  the  panel  that  doesn’t  agree  that
that  is  where  we  need  to  move  energy  generation  when  we  are
talking  about  being  responsible  and  sustainable  with  the  way  we
are  going  to  be  generating  power  today  and  tomorrow?  That  is
great to hear.

As  we  are  discussing  the  future  of  generation  and  some  of  the
improvements  that  are  being  invested  in  and  made  by  utilities
across  the  country  and  some  of  the  awareness  that  is  being  gen-
erated  around  the  world,  Mr.  Monroe,  what  is  one  of  the  biggest
reasons that your company has moved forward with commitment in
research  and  development?  Is  it  to  be  more  responsible  the  way
that  we  are  generating  power  today,  to  do  things  better  than  the
way we have been doing them in the past, maybe?

Mr. MONROE. It is sort of a balanced view, is to—we have always
tried to balance sort of the cost of electricity we supply to our cus-
tomers with the environmental footprint that our generating plants
have.  And  so  as  we  become  more  aware  of  how  our  emissions  may
effect  the  climate,  we  have  become  much  more  worried  about  that
and  so  have  moved  forward  with  research  trying  to  anticipate.

What  we  don’t  like  is  to  suddenly  have  very  steep  changes  in  the
way  we  would  generate  electricity,  and  so  we  view  through  re-
search  a  way  to  sort  of  smooth  out  that  path  so  that  when  we  see
a future transition coming, we start actively working on it.
Mr. LUJA´ N. So with that being said, would you agree that we can
do things better than the way that we are doing them today when
it comes to the way that we are generating power from the various
resources that we have, renewables included?

Mr.  MONROE.  Yes,  we  can,  but  again,  in  this  concept  of  balance
between  affordability  of  electricity  and  what  we  do,  environmental
footprint,  that  is  our  main  concern,  is  sort  of  doing  a  good  job  for
our  customers  to  bring  them  affordable  electricity.  In  your  area  of
the country, renewables are much more accessible than they are in
the  southeast,  so  we  have  been  working  quite  hard  to  try  to  find
out how to do significant renewables. We don’t have much wind in
the  southeast.  The  solar  energy  appears  to  be  there,  but  because
of  haze  and  humidity,  it  is  not  that  effective  in  the  deep  south.  So
the one area that we look at the closest is biomass. And so we are
in  the  process  as  we  speak  of  converting  one  of  our  older  coal
plants, taking the fuel away as coal and adding it as wood from the
forests of Georgia. This is in Albany, Georgia, a small plant, about
100-megawatts.  So  we  are  moving  in  that  renewable  direction  as
well. We are also investigating nuclear power as a way to minimize
that environmental footprint.

But  as  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  we  are  still  a  very  large,
coal-based  sort  of  system,  so  we  have  started  to  put  lots  of  re-
sources  into  looking  at,  is  there  a  way  to  lessen  the  footprint  of
these coal plants?

ON THE AFFORDABILITY OF CLEAN COAL

Mr.  LUJA´ N.  Thank  you.  Dr.  Der,  when  we  are  talking  about  the
future  of  generation  of  electricity,  the  way  that  it  is  moving  for-
ward, when you talk about pulverized coal and the way that it has
been  generated  in  the  past  and  the  concern  about  moving  forward
and  the  support,  even  though  the  project  didn’t  move  forward
under the previous Administration with this whole concept of clean
coal, I noticed that in your testimony that you talk about advanced
coal but the only mention of clean coal is in the description of some
of  the  agencies  that  are  working  with  you.  Is  there  a  reason  that
you chose to use the word advanced as opposed to clean?

Dr. DER. Yes. I think advanced coal implies that we are working
on  technologies  that  make  it  clean  which  would  include  the  cap-
ture, the carbon associated with it. In advanced coal, we are trying
to  move  that  yardstick  forward  to  looking  at  technologies  that  are
affordable  that  allow  us  to  reach  those  goals  of  reducing  those
emissions including carbon.
Mr. LUJA´ N. And one last question, Mr. Chairman, Dr. Der, as we
are moving forward with the way that we are looking at generation
today,  should  future  proposed  coal-generating  facilities  be  really
maybe put on hold or considered to scale back until we are able to
move forward and develop these important technologies there have
been such a serious investment in?

Dr.  DER.  I  think  because  of  the  projections  and  the  increase  in
the  electricity  demand  and  the  needs  for  this  country  and  around

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:25 Sep 20, 2009 Jkt 047719 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\E&E09\031109\47719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

the  world,  I  think  we  still  have  to  retain  that  option  to  move  for-
ward while we work on the research to reduce that cost and its per-
formance.  We  need  to  move  forward  in  a  parallel  approach  for  the
same reasons that Mr. Monroe advocated, that we need experience
in looking at some of these coal plants that we can put carbon cap-
ture  and  storage  onto,  even  though  they  are  expensive  now,  and
the  experience  that  we  have  from  doing  that  are  lessons  learned
that  allow  us  to  do  things  a  little  more  efficiently  while  we  bring
down  those  costs  and  wait  for  these  new  technologies  to  be  put  on
and  replace  these  technologies  here.  So  I  think  the  overall  future
demand  would  probably  not  allow  us  to  maybe  put  a  hold  on  coal.
We should do it as we say in an advanced, clean manner, including
the carbon capture.

Mr. LUJA´ N. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  Chairman  thanks  the  gentleman  and  now
recognizes  the  gentleman  from  Florida,  Mr.  Diaz-Balart.  Thank
you. The Chairman now recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. Edwards.

CONCERNS AND SKEPTICISM ABOUT CCS

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you  to  the
panel.  I  am  just  curious.  I  just  want  to  be  really  clear  about  that.
Can you just raise your hand if you are at all skeptical about CCS
as  a  future  technology?  Can  you  please  describe  your  skepticism,
and  especially  as  it  relates  to  reaching  peak  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions in 2015?

Ms. FORBES. We have to demonstrate it. I think the reach is real-
ly promising, but we haven’t done it at scale and I think one of the
things  that  we  learned  in  developing  the  guidelines,  we  have  to
balance our confidence about the fact that we think this technology
is going to work and it is an important part of a portfolio solutions
for  climate  change  with  the  fact  that  there  are  still  questions  that
we don’t know, questions that can’t be answered until we move for-
ward with the demonstrations.

Ms. EDWARDS. Can I just ask, just in terms of the amount of the
expenditure  over  the  lifetime  of  this  particular  investigatory  stage
that  could  be  spent  not  just  in  renewables  but  in  existing  coal
plants  and  making  those  more  efficient  because  they  exist?  It
seems  to  me  a  lot  of  the  discussion  is  about  building  new  plants,
and  in  this  country  and  around  the  globe,  we  have  old  plants  that
are  in  existence  that  are  inefficient,  that  are  producing  CO2 emis-
sions at tremendous scale and yet we are investing in a technology
that may or may not work in 20 or 30 years.

Ms. FORBES. Technology for carbon capture and storage must in-
clude approaches that apply to the existing fleet to post-combustion
capture.  The  original  FutureGen  was  an  integrated  gasification
combined  cycle  would  be  a  new  plant,  but  CCS  broadly  should  ex-
plore  opportunities  to  deal  with  the  existing  fleet  as  well  as  the
plants that they are building in China and India right now.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  And  is  it  your  view  that  the  current  plan,  the
evolved plan from the canceled FutureGen project, focuses on exist-
ing plants?

Ms.  FORBES.  I  would  defer  that  question  to  Mr.  Gaffigan.  I  be-
lieve  it  allows  for  existing  plants  for  post-combustion,  and  I  think
that  is  one  of  the  pros  of  the  new  approach,  but  I  also  think  there

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:25 Sep 20, 2009 Jkt 047719 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\DWORK\E&E09\031109\47719 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

was  a  substantial  investment  in  the  original  FutureGen  that
shouldn’t  be  ignored.  I  think  there  are  advantages  to  both  ap-
proaches.

Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Gaffigan.
Mr. GAFFIGAN. It allowed for both.
Ms. EDWARDS. Is that what is happening?
Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  We  don’t  know.  DOE  has  gotten  a  small  number
of proposals from the restructured FutureGen. They have asked for
more information from some of the proposals—right now it is in the
negotiation phase. I don’t know if Dr. Der has an update, but right
now  the  main  difference  to  think  about  is,  you  know,  the  original
FutureGen  was  an  exclusive  focus  on  IGCC,  and  whether  that  is
good or bad, I will allow the policy-makers to decide. It was an ex-
clusive focus. It was considered one of the tools going forward. And
the  difference  now,  even  in  the  initial  proposal  for  restructured
FutureGen, it talked about an IGCC focus, but when the actual bid
went  out  for  proposals,  they  had  also  allowed  for  others  to  include
existing.

Ms. EDWARDS. And how many existing coal plants do we have in

the country? Anybody know?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Somewhere  over  600  in  this  country  I  guess,  ac-
cording  to  Dr.  Der.  It  depends  on  the  size  of  some  of  these  plants.
Some  are  very  small.  We  have  heard  figures  of  about  1,100  but
that might include some really small plants.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Okay.  And  then  Mr.  Gaffigan  again,  in  terms  of
the  cost,  I  mean,  I  understand  you  know,  the  math  error  which  is
unbelievable.  I  mean,  we  should  send  everybody  to  second  grade.
But  I  wonder,  even  in  the  best  circumstances,  would  a  39  percent
overrun have been acceptable over the life of a project?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Potentially  again,  as  these  are  very  preliminary
cost  estimates,  and  you  are  going  to  see  some  cost  escalations,  es-
pecially  with  state-of-the-art  and  new  R&D  type  things.  Whether
39  percent  is  tolerable  or  not,  that  depends  on  how  it  is  managed
throughout. What I would point out again is that there was a new
cost estimate being prepared that probably would have given better
information and was more site specific.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  But  I  mean,  in  fact  though,  if  GAO  were  evalu-
ating a project, whether it is in this department or another depart-
ment  with  a  39  percent  cost  overrun,  you  would  have  raised  some
questions about that, wouldn’t you have?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Well,  we  have,  sure,  depending  on  how  it  was
handled. I mean, they could have decided that they wanted to pur-
sue a different scope, and it was agreed upon that that would cause
the  cost  increase.  It  is  whether  it  is  managed  or  not  that  I  think
is  key.  I  mean,  there  are  some  projects  in  DOE  we  just  recently
tested more on the weapons side. I think we looked at eight out of
ten projects, and combined, there was over $14 billion in cost over-
runs.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Yes,  I  know,  and  I  think  a  lot  of  us  have  some
concerns about that. And then just out of curiosity, Dr. Der, I won-
der  if  you  could  talk  to  me  about  the  ability  to  rely  on  a  projected
operation  or  commercialization  say  in  20  years  with  investments,
even in the revamped FutureGen and how that relates to what we
might  take  that  same  money  and  spend  on  other  kinds  of  tech-

nology that would serve to reduce carbon emissions in the 20 to 30
years?

Dr.  DER.  I  think  given  the  magnitude  and  the  reliance  that  not
only  the  United  States  has  on  coal  for  power  generation  but  the
rest  of  the  world,  I  think  it  is  important  for  us  to  work  on  solving
that  problem.  You  are  right  in  saying  that  we  have  an  existing
fleet  and  Mr.  Gaffigan  was  talking  about  the  fact  that  the
FutureGen  project  looked  at  new  construction.  Our  program  is
more  comprehensive  than  just  looking  at  the  gasification.  It  ad-
dresses the capture, the stack capture of carbon emissions from ex-
isting  fleet.  It  is  a  challenging  and  daunting  task.  The  Secretary
is committed to focusing on that as an additional area of emphasis
as well. So I think the problems should be worked on now.

cost?

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much. I know that this was a dif-
ferent  Administration,  but  why  was  the  project  canceled  last  year
or in the last two years?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  We  were  asked  that  question,  and  we  asked  over
and  over  again,  and  we  were  told  that  it  was  because  of  the  cost
doubling.  And  we  were  pointed  to  the  Secretary.  It  was  his  deci-
sion,  and  we  were  pointed  to  his  testimony  on  the  matter.  So  the
bottom line for the most part the answer was because the cost had
doubled.

Ms. JOHNSON. And you are ready now to look at it again for less

Mr. GAFFIGAN. Well, I guess that would be up to the current Ad-
ministration,  whether  they  want  to  look  at  it.  Our  point  was  that
there  were  very  preliminary  cost  estimates,  and  to  throw  out  this
doubling  was  really  not  accurate  in  terms  of  the  potential  cost  in-
crease. I don’t know if Dr. Der wants to add to that.

Dr.  DER.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  Secretary  is  planning
to meet with the FutureGen Alliance to restart discussions on this
particular project.

Mr. COSTELLO. If the gentlelady will yield to the Chairman?
Ms. JOHNSON. Yes.
Mr. COSTELLO. The reason as you will recall given by the Admin-
istration  for  canceling  the  project  was  the  escalating  cost,  and  the
Administration  indicated  they  didn’t  anticipate  the  increase  in
costs. They were using, as Mr. Gaffigan—I won’t put words in your
mouth.  If  you  will  explain  the  numbers  that  they  were  using  in
terms of real dollars versus——

Ms. JOHNSON. Imaginary.
Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Well,  roughly,  and  this  is  ballpark,  they  were
talking originally about a billion dollar project. They compared that
to  an  escalated  cost  through  2017  of  $1.8  billion.  If  you  took  those
dollars  and  took  them  back  to  the  same  year’s  dollars,  you  would
be  talking  about  roughly  $1.3  billion.  So  the  actual  increase  that
the  Alliance  brought  forward  was  about  $300  million.  And  I  also
point out that that was discussed in March of ’07 when they signed
the latest cooperative agreement or the next part of it, the continu-

ation.  It  was  only  after  that  then  that  we  started  questioning  this
cost  and  then  the  concerns  about  the  doubling  of  costs  started  to
be talked about.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  And  I  would  point  out  to  the  gentlelady  that
Chairman  Gordon,  Chairman  Baird  and  myself  and  Mr.  Lipinski
asked the GAO to do a report and to look at the reason. You know,
was  it  in  fact  cost,  and  I  think  the  GAO  report  which  is  being  re-
leased today will indicate that it was not cost and was not justified
stopping the project because of cost. And they looked and analyzed
the numbers and said that the Administration was not using accu-
rate figures.

I  pointed  out  earlier,  too,  in  an  earlier  Subcommittee  hearing  as
you will recall, if you look at other projects in the same timeframe
that  increased  in  cost,  it  was  as  a  result  of  the  increase  in  cost  of
building  materials,  concrete,  other  materials,  as  well  as  labor.  So
I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much. That is the end of my ques-

tion.

Mr. COSTELLO. The Chairman now recognizes Mr. Tonko.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE DEMANDS

Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you for this important
hearing,  and  I  thank  the  panel  also.  Dr.  Der,  the  issue  of  infra-
structure  for  carbon  capture  and  storage  is  one  that  comes  up
often,  and  I  am  wondering  where  the  Department  might  be  in
terms of analyses that are done or any efforts being done on a proc-
ess  to  address  pipelines  that  might  be  required  to  deal  with  the
point of emission onto the storage area and if there is a plan to do
that in a national framework.

Dr.  DER.  The  pipeline  infrastructure  that  would  be  associated
with  carbon  cap  and  storage,  depending  on  how  far  the  transport
of the CO2 goes, could be considerable. The jurisdiction as I under-
stand it relative to pipeline infrastructure and regulations does not
rest  with  the  Department  of  Energy;  it  rests,  I  believe,  with  the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and to a large degree with
the states.

Mr.  TONKO.  Is  anyone  else  on  the  panel  able  to  offer  any
thoughts  on  that  as  to  how  that  infrastructure  may  be  addressed
in your particular cases?

Mr. GAFFIGAN. I would just offer one thought, and I think it goes
to  Ms.  Edwards’  earlier  comment  about,  you  know,  are  you  skep-
tical  about  CCS?  I  don’t  know  if  I  am  skeptical.  What  I  would  say
is there are a great deal of uncertainties, and this is definitely one
of  them,  the  infrastructure  to  move  the  CO2 around  at  the  scale
that  Ms.  Forbes  is  referring  to.  I  mean,  I  think  we  know  we  can
do carbon capture and storage. Can we do it at this huge scale and
put  all  this  stuff,  move  it  around,  put  it  in  the  ground  and  hope
that it stays there?

Mr.  TONKO.  And  in  terms  of  another  bit  of  infrastructure,  with
water  demands  that  may  be  increased  and  enhanced,  are  there  ef-
forts  being  made  to  review  just  what  the  water  issue  might  be  for
some of these facilities?

Dr.  DER.  Yes,  I  think  there  was  a  panel  yesterday  that  talked
about  water  and  energy  nexus  and  the  discussion  that  centered

around  carbon  capture  and  storage  did  indicate  that  there  would
be an increase in water usage given the current capture technology
that exists today, and one of the things that the Department of En-
ergy is looking at are advanced capture systems that would reduce
the consumption of the water as well as the energy penalties asso-
ciated with it as well as the cost of the components.

Mr. TONKO. Thank you very much. Now, as in my last station be-
fore  coming  here,  I  was  at  NYCERTA  in  New  York  with  the  En-
ergy, Research and Development Authority. I know there are those
who  are  looking  for  sequestration  facilities,  and  there  are  a  lot  of
concerns  about  the  price  obviously  and  a  number  of  the  dynamics
that  need  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  provide  for  a  safe  and  effec-
tive outcome. But I thank you all for your input.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  Chairman  thanks  the  gentleman  and  now
recognizes  the  Ranking  Member  for  another  round  of  questioning.
Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  mentioned  break-
throughs  earlier  and  the  hope  for  breakthroughs.  Help  me  figure
out  where  is  it  likely  to  come  from.  Anybody  want  to  take  a  shot
at what kind of technologies, what kind of processes might give us
these breakthroughs?

Mr.  MONROE.  I  will  start.  The  technologies  we  would  use  today,
and  it  really  doesn’t  matter  whether  it  is  IGCC  or  a  conventional
coal  plant  really,  are  adapted  from  chemical  and  petroleum  indus-
tries. They use a water-based chemical, a basic chemical to capture
the  acidic  CO2.  Part  of  the  energy  penalty  is,  and  you  mentioned
the water usage, that is part of the water usage. So we capture the
CO2 with  this  water  mixture,  we  have  to  take  it  somewhere  else
to get the CO2 to turn loose, we reuse the chemical and it is really
the  heat  to  make  that  CO2 turn  loose  that  makes  it  so  expensive
on the capture side. It is the energy to do that. That is the biggest
piece we looked at for benefits there. We still have to compress the
CO2,  so  there  is  still  a  significant  sort  of  energy  to  make  it  a  high
enough pressure to put down a pipeline or even push underground.
So we are really looking at how to take CO2 out of the stream.

So I will mention some that are interesting to us. Some are solid
chemicals  that  could  capture  the  CO2.  Then  we  wouldn’t  have  to
heat  up  this  70  percent  water  and  waste  all  of  that  heat.  Mem-
branes  to  sort  of  on  a  molecular  level  filter  the  CO2 and  get  the
CO2 to  come  through  this  filter,  but  the  rest  of  the  gas  not  come
through, are some of the most promising ones right now.

Mr. INGLIS. Anybody else want to——

INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  I  just  want  to  weigh  one  thing  in  terms  of  the
technology.  Obviously,  GAO  doesn’t  bring  the  technology  to  the
table.  We  were  really  impressed  with  the  wide  range  of  expertise
that is out there, both in the private sector and at DOE. But what
I would say is going to sort of bring the breakthroughs is the incen-
tive  to  do  so  and  to  let  that  private  sector  get  out  there  and  do
those  things.  And  I  think  one  of  the  signals  could  be  some  regu-
latory  certainty  about  what  we  are  going  to  do  about  carbon.  That
would  bring  that  private  sector  to  achieve  some  of  these  break-
throughs.

Mr. INGLIS. Interesting.

Dr. DER. The Department of Energy and its national laboratories
and  universities  are  actually  working  very  hard  on  this  particular
issue about the energy penalty and the costs associated with these
revolutionary  ideas,  and  as  the  Secretary  mentioned,  these  trans-
formational,  game-changing  technologies.  Some  of  the  ideas  out
there right now include the clafate capture of the CO2, which basi-
cally is, it locks it into a structure and you can re-release it. There
are  ideas  know  as  ionic  liquids  where  it  is  basically  a  filter  where
the  CO2 goes  into  these  spaces  and  again,  with  just  a  very  small
amount  of  energy  and  pressure  differentials,  you  can  re-release
that as well. So the key here is capital costs, energy penalty reduc-
tion,  and  making  sure  those  technologies  integrate  well  with  the
power plant or any other type of industrial source.

Dr.  FINLEY.  I  would  like  to  add  one  more  comment.  I  think  it  is
very important if we look at some of the soft ideas, though not hard
technologies,  we  need  to  relate  to.  We  need  to  understand  who
owns  the  pour  space.  We  need  to  understand  a  regulatory  frame-
work in which this will take place. We need to understand, how do
we  go  about  leasing  the  subsurface  rights  in  the  land  areas  for
large-scale demonstrations? And not only that, we need to look be-
yond—we  are  now  at  the  deployment  phase  for  testing.  What  hap-
pens  for  example  in  a  given  geological  region  if,  for  example,  you
have 20 of these projects putting away five million tons a year per
project  in  the  subsurface?  What  does  that  do  on  a  large  regional
scale to aquifers, the subsurface environment, and so forth because
ultimately  the  scale  of  this  to  be  totally  effective  could  become
quite  large,  and  the  issue  of  public  acceptance  and  the  framework
in  which  this  takes  place  legally  and  from  a  regulatory  framework
must also be looked at.

Mr. INGLIS. Any idea whether China has favorable geological for-

mations for sequestration? Anybody know that?

Ms.  FORBES.  There  have  been  some  preliminary  studies.  It  looks
like  there  are  some  willing  gas  fields  in  China  that  are  promising
that would be potential opportunities and also some of the U.S. ge-
ologists  have  been  going  over  to  China  and  working  with  the  Chi-
nese, specifically with Shenhua to look and see—that is the biggest
coal  company  in  China—to  see,  associated  with  one  of  their  big
coal-to-liquid plants. They are doing a test injection, and they have
been doing real characterization of the geology to determine how it
is going to work. It is potentially promising.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Very  helpful.  Mr.  Gaffigan  I  think  has  a  key  thing
there  that  is  so  exciting  to  hear,  the  concept  of  the  private  sector
having  an  incentive  to  do  this  because  you  know,  what  Microsoft
and Apple did for the PC and the Internet, the private sector prop-
erly  incentivized  by  a  price  signal  being  attached  to  this  negative
externality and have that attached to the product would drive inno-
vation  faster  than  anything  we  could  do  from  this  Science  Com-
mittee or anything we could do in Congress.

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Absolutely.  It  goes  to  your  point  about  your
PSC’s.  They  are  not  going  to  approve  things  until  they  see  it  is  in
their  best  interest.  Most  of  the  folks  out  there  are  in  a  wait-and-
see.

Mr. INGLIS. Right.
Mr. GAFFIGAN. They are wait and see.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PROJECT SITING

Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  Chairman  thanks  you.  Dr.  Finley,  in  your
testimony you talk about the importance of characterization, and I
wonder if you would talk about how long it takes to conduct robust
site characterization and also the cost associated as well?

Dr. FINLEY. I think if you were to start at ground zero, let us say
in  a  region  where  you  know  such  a  project  currently  existed,  you
would probably need at least a year to put together a full-scale geo-
logic  framework  based  on  existing  data.  At  that  point  in  time,  I
think  you  would  be  ready  to  run  geophysics  and  to  perhaps  drill
a  preliminary  well,  a  stratigraphic  test.  Carrying  that  out  and
aligning  that  data  would  take  you  at  least  another  year  or  so  I
would  think,  a  two-year  process  at  a  minimum  from  the  get-go  to
at least to have an understanding of whether a site would be suit-
able.  I  think  the  cost  of  doing  that  at  a  minimal  framework  could
be in the range of let us say $15 to $20 million.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  And  do  you  know  how  much  the  State  of  Illinois
spent  on  looking  at  the  sites  in  the  State  of  Illinois  in  order  to
make their case to the alliance?

Dr.  FINLEY.  I  believe  State  funds,  certainly  several  million.  I
don’t  know  the  exact  number,  but  I  know  that  almost  $1  million
was  spent  in  the  State  of  Illinois  funds  since  the  project  was  can-
celed alone to demonstrate the continued suitability of the site and
the  contribution  that  the  State  made  to  the  Alliance  purchase  of
the 400-plus acres for the site.

Mr. COSTELLO. And I think that is one of the points that I made
earlier  about  being  outraged  in  pulling  the  plug.  This  was  a  com-
petitive  process,  and  the  State  of  Illinois  and  other  states  as  well
spent  millions  of  dollars  in  the  competition.  So  I  wanted  to  point
that  out.  If  you  start  from  ground  zero,  you  are  talking  about  a
minimum  of  a  two-year  process  and  at  least  in  Illinois,  my  knowl-
edge  of  the  site  that  the  Alliance  selected,  the  State  of  Illinois
spent  well  over  $10  million  and  probably  closer  to  $20  million  in
this competition.

Dr. Der, let me ask you, and I don’t know if you are in a position
to tell us, but to your knowledge, how is the Department planning
on  spending  the  funds  available  under  the  Recovery  and  Reinvest-
ment Act?

Dr.  DER.  The  guidelines  that  were  put  into  the  legislation  put
monies  into  certain  pots  of  that  $3.4  billion.  There  is  $800  million
that  is  going  to  go  to  augmenting  the  CCPI  round  three  which  in-
cludes carbon capture. There was another $1.52 billion in there for
looking  at  industrial  carbon  capture  and  storage  projects,  $50  mil-
lion associated with the characterizing additional sites, $20 million
for some research and training on the geological sequestration. The
remaining  $1  billion  is  something  that  the  Secretary  and  the  De-
partment  is  still  making  decisions  on  and  will  probably  come  to
that shortly.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Would  you  in  your  opinion  being  involved  in  the
FutureGen program in the Department for the last five-plus years,
would you classify the FutureGen project as a shovel-ready or near
shovel-ready project as far as sequestration is concerned?

108

Dr.  DER.  I  would  probably  characterize  it  as  something  that
would  be  near  shovel-ready.  We  have  to  probably  finish  up  some
work that was not finished up in the preliminary design phase that
was specific to that particular site, do some more of the character-
ization  that  Dr.  Finley  talked  about  specific  to  that  and  finish  up
the design. And after doing something like that, it would be pretty
much ready to go forward.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Is  there  any  sequestration  project  that  you  are
aware of that is more advanced or ready more so than FutureGen?

Dr. DER. Not to my knowledge at the current time, sir.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  Last  question,  Dr.  Der,  can  you  share  with  us
some  of  your  thoughts  or  concerns  about  the  restructured
FutureGen program?

Dr. DER. I think when you look at it on balance, the restructured
FutureGen  program  sort  of  addresses  a  different  issue  than  the
original  FutureGen.  The  original  FutureGen  as  an  advanced  plat-
form  for  testing  these  new  technologies  was  to  push  the  stick  for-
ward, if you will, on the technology for gasification. In the restruc-
tured  FutureGen,  it  focuses  on  putting  technologies  that  we  have
today  onto  existing  commercial  platforms  and  to  gain  that  kind  of
experience  early  on,  and  that  in  itself  also  has  value.  So  it  is  a
judgment  call  as  to,  you  know,  which  way  do  we  go  on  something
like that.

INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS

Mr.  COSTELLO.  My  final  question  of  you,  Dr.  Der,  and  I  would
ask  Ms.  Forbes  or  any  of  the  other  witnesses  to  comment,  we
talked  about  international  partners  that  were  very  interested  and
committed  actually  to  participating  in  the  FutureGen  project,
China, India, a number of other countries. One, my understanding
is  the  way  that  some  of  these  countries  found  out  that  we  were
pulling  the  plug  is  they  read  it  in  media  reports.  They  were  not
given  advanced  notice.  Two,  do  you  feel  that  the  interest  will  still
be  there  that  we  can  still  bring  these  other  countries  and  inter-
national interest into this project?

Dr.  DER.  I  think  the  Secretary  Chu  has  indicated  that  it  makes
sense  for  countries  to  collaborate  and  coordinate  its  portfolio
projects, and I know that he has been taking a very proactive posi-
tion  in  contacting  his  counterparts  around  the  world.  And  I  have
all  the  confidence  in  the  world  that  he  will  be  successful  in  doing
that.

Mr. COSTELLO. Ms. Forbes, would you want to comment?
Ms.  FORBES.  Yeah.  Based  on  our  experience  in  working  with
some  of  China’s  leading  CCS  experts,  I  would  say  there  is  defi-
nitely  interest  in  collaboration  on  demonstrations  and  also  on
issues  that  are  associated  with  policy  and  regulatory  and  really
building capacity. They like to work together.

Mr. COSTELLO. Any other comments from——
Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  Just  a  quick  note,  you  know,  I  think  the  inter-
national  partners  were  putting  out  money  toward  this,  up  to  eight
percent, and one of the considerations in looking at options for cost
escalation  was  to  look  for  whether  they  were  going  to  contribute
more.  And  as  I  understand  it,  we  still  have  the  money  from  India,
so we need to make a decision there one way or the other.

Mr. COSTELLO. Dr. Finley.
Dr.  FINLEY.  I  think  your  point  is  very  well  taken.  It  is  all  one
atmosphere,  and  I  think  to  the  extent  that  we  provide  technology
in  a  collaborative  manner  with  international  partners  around  the
world, I think it is absolutely essential. I think in some cases these
partners  for  example  are  not  even  totally  aware  of  the  level  of  ef-
fort that the United States is making, and I think in part the case
when the Chinese delegation visited our site in Decatur, they were
very excited to see an actual well going down into which we would
put a million tons of CO2.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  Chairman  thanks  you  and  now  recognizes

the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be brief. GAO
had  said  that  incentives  would  really  come  from  regulatory  cer-
tainty and that a price on carbon would spur technological innova-
tion in effect. Are we seeing those technological innovations coming
from Europe as far as CCS is concerned? How much and how dra-
matic and how aggressive?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  The  international  expertise  is  not  my  bailiwick,
but  I  will  say  from  what  we  have  seen,  you  know,  they  are  strug-
gling with their system to figure out, is it working? And I think we
will probably go through some of the same things.

My  point  in  general  is  that  in  this  country,  folks  are  looking  for
that  regular  certainty.  Some  folks  like  Mr.  Monroe’s  company  are
trying to hedge a little bit and anticipate what might happen. I am
not  as  familiar  with  the  international  activities  in  Europe.  I  don’t
know if Ms. Forbes might be.

Ms.  FORBES.  Three  things  that  I  would  like  to  mention  going  on
in  Europe.  First,  the  European  Union  has  finalized  a  directive  for
geologic sequestration which includes the environmental regulatory
structure  for  how  to  do  CCS  responsibly.  There  has  also  been  an
effort, and this is in my written testimony as well, to commit fund-
ing for CCS demonstrations, a network of 10 to 12 throughout Eu-
rope  through  proceeds  from  the  European  trading  scheme.  Addi-
tionally, some of the European utilities have been really proactive.
It  is  my  understanding  that  one  of  the  European  utilities  actually
has pilot-scale tests of each of the commercial capture options that
are out there today, and they are currently operating and basically
testing all of them to see which one operates the best.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Again, we are not—I am sorry. Yes, sir?
Mr.  MONROE.  We  see  lots  of  ideas  coming  to  the  table  now,  so
people  are  engaged  in  the  subject.  We  see  the  beginning  of  sort  of
basic  R&D  sort  of  really  kicking  off  now.  We  do  worry  about  too
much regulation too quick and that sort of we would be forced into
building  gas  generation,  then,  to  meet  that.  So  we  see  the  sort  of
ingenuity of the American people in the university system and na-
tional labs already engaged on this issue. They are not waiting for
anything further.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  I  am  not  saying  that  you  should  know  obvi-
ously,  but  do  any  of  you  have  any  real  idea  as  to  what  we  have
seen  with  these  technological  breakthroughs  coming  from  Europe?
Because  they  do  seem  to  have  some  I  guess  certainty.  Has  Europe
become the bastion of CCS technological innovation?

Ms.  FORBES.  I  think  U.S.  R&D  program  for  CCS  is  among  the
best in the world. The Europeans are also doing a lot of work. They
have  gone  further  on  the  policy  and  regulatory  side  than  we  have
here  in  the  States.  But  our  research  program  is—the  IEA  did  a
study,  and  it  called  the  Regional  Partnership  Program  specifically
the  world’s  most  ambitious  program.  Unfortunately,  that  program
is  not  very  well  known  internationally,  and  I  think  we  could  do
some programs to offer exchanges to get more experts like Dr. Fin-
ley  in  the  international  community  and  get  some  exchange  hap-
pening.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

THE VIABILITY OF CCS AS AN INVESTMENT

Chair  BAIRD.  Thank  you.  I’m  sorry  I  had  to  step  away.  We  had
action on the Floor and a bill I had worked on, ironically on ocean
acidification,  so  maybe  appropriately  so.  As  I  look  at  this  capture
and sequestration, I have a couple of questions that come to mind.
I  will  put  those  out  there,  and  maybe  you  can  address  them.  One
has  to  do  with  just  estimated  net  capacity.  In  other  words,  what
is  the  width  of  likely  amount  of  carbon  that  we  can  capture,  and
timeframe.  The  best  climate  change/acidification  scientists  I  know
of  say  that  we  should  shoot  for  nothing  higher  than  350  parts  per
million  as  a  goal,  and  we  already  exceed  that  in  terms  of  atmos-
pheric loading of CO2. We already exceed that, and so my question
is, how long is it going to take us to get some meaningful reduction
in  CO2 output,  and  what  is  the  likely  capacity  we  can.  And  my
hunch  is  it  is  going  to  take  a  long  time  and  we  are  not  going  to
be able to ultimately get that much out. And then the question for
me  is  should  we  not  then  focus  on  other  modalities  as  a  priority
for  our  financial  investment?  I  will  just  put  that  out  there,  and
whoever wants to take a swing at it I am happy to hear from.

Dr.  DER.  You  are  all  looking  at  me.  From  what  I  have  read  in
the  literature,  including  the  IEA  reports,  if  we  are  going  to  come
down to some kind of a stabilization in the atmospheric concentra-
tions  or  whatever  level  that  is  key,  it  shows  that  carbon  capture
and  storage,  along  with  the  other  mitigation  measures,  constitutes
somewhere around 20 percent. Other reports say a little bit higher.
That  tells  me  that  it  needs  to  be  an  essential  part  of  the  portfolio
of  mitigation  measures,  along  with  efficiency,  in-use  efficiencies,
nuclear,  wind,  solar,  and  natural  gas.  So  it  is  very  difficult  to  get
to  stabilization  without  looking  at  carbon  capture  and  storage  be-
cause  of  the  existing  inventory  that  we  have  out  there  that  relies
on fossil fuels.

The  other  thing  is  that  the  storage  capacity  at  least  in  the
United  States.  Dr.  Finley  could  probably  answer  the  question  bet-
ter  than  I.  We  have  done  a  national  atlas  of  the  storage  capacity
in North America, primarily Canada and the United States, and it
shows that we have considerable storage capacity, several hundred
years’  worth.  And  looking  at  the  point  sources  where  the  power
plants  are  and  where  the  potential  storage  sites  might  be,  and
what  are  the  reasons  for  looking  at  saline  reservoirs  is  because
that  type  of  formation  in  the  wet  sands  represents  the  majority  of
that  storage  capacity.  And  I  defer  to  Dr.  Finley  to  augment  my
statement on that.

Dr. FINLEY. Yeah, I can quote you the numbers from memory for
the  Illinois  basin,  just  to  give  you  a  representative  example.  That
region  of  Illinois,  Indiana,  and  western  Kentucky  emits  about  304
million metric tons of CO2 per year from stationary sources. 90 per-
cent  of  those  sources  are  coal-fired  power  plants.  So  we  have  got
say a third of a billion tons. The storage capacity in the saline res-
ervoir as Dr. Der mentioned is roughly between 27 and 109 billion
metric  tons.  So  we  have  at  least  probably  in  the  order  of  at  least
100  years  of  storage,  possibly  400  years  of  storage  in  saline  res-
ervoirs in this region.

The  second  version  of  the  second  edition  of  the  atlas  that  DOE
has put forth has refined some of those earlier estimated numbers.
The reality is that certainly 200 years’ worth of storage, if we could
capture  virtually  all  of  the  emissions  from  the  known  current  sta-
tionary sources.

Chair  BAIRD.  What  about  the  timeframe?  When  do  we  think  we

will be able to do this?

Ms.  FORBES.  I  will  be  happy  to  take  that  question.  I  think  that
the  question  of  the  timeframe  is  really  about  what—we  haven’t
demonstrated it yet. We don’t know if can play. Right out analyses,
as  Dr.  Der  mentioned,  of  how  we  are  going  to  get  to  global  goals
for climate change rely heavily on CCS. The IEA study says to cut
50 percent of the projected emission projections that we need to cut
by 2050, CCS is for 20 percent. So unless we demonstrate the tech-
nology,  it  is  not  going  to  play.  So  ultimately,  I  think  the  urgency
is  on  demonstrating  it  and  how  those  demonstrations  are  going  to
go will depend on when we decide to do it.

Mr. MONROE. And I would agree with that. I work with the Coal
Utilization Research Council, and they are probably the most active
at  looking  at  least  for  coal  plants  what  is  the  ramp  to  get  from
where  we  are  now  to  what  we  would  call  commercially  ready  car-
bon  capture  and  sequestration.  So  it  is  different  than  commercial
availability.  Commercial  availability  is  when  someone  will  sell  you
something. Commercially available to us means when do the banks
accept  it  for  financing,  the  regulations  are  set.  We  can  build  a
strong  business  case  with  Public  Service  Commissions’  signing  on
for  that  for  it  to  be  ready.  So  in  answer  to  your  question  specifi-
cally, we are looking at a timeframe of 2020 to 2025 if we are doing
this  demonstration  sort  of  up-ramp  between  then  and  now  so  that
we  think  at  that  point  the  utility  industry  would  be  ready  to  sort
of  start  installing  those  as  a  normal  matter  of  course.  So  when  we
look  at  that,  between  now  and  then,  we  are  looking  at  maybe  15
gigawatts  which  might  be  as  many  as  30  plants  sort  of  as  part  of
this  demonstration  and  development  and  sort  of  different  options.
So  in  this  route,  we  like  a  lot  of  duplication.  That  is  not  great  to
hear,  but  we  like  different  technologies.  We  think  we  need  seques-
tration in different regions of the country for public acceptance reg-
ulatory  sort  of  thing.  So  in  this  case,  it  sounds  like  a  lot,  but  we
do need those parallel paths to get there.

URGENCY AND THE CCS TIMEFRAME

Chair BAIRD. I appreciate that. I will close with just this concern,
2025  sounds  like  a  long  time  away  to  me  given  the  urgency  of  the
situation.  Already  off  our  coast  in  the  northwest  we  are  seeing

acidification rates that are presumably harming shellfish and other
creatures,  and  2025  is  a  long  way  away,  and  that  is  to  start  the
installation of this and that is at substantial additional cost per ton
of coal burned. So the question for me becomes economics, environ-
mental  impact,  and  practicality.  It  feels  a  little  bit  like  having  fol-
lowed  the  debates  on  fusion  energy  for  20,  30  years  now  myself,  it
is always 20 or 30 years away. It feels a little bit like that, but the
urgency  is  greater  and  maybe  your  technology  is  more  promising.
I would hope it is. But I just want to put that concern, and I would
hope  we  would  not  see  capture  and  sequestration  as  the  deus  ex
machina that saves us. I think there may be other machinas if not
other deuses. I am not sure. Dr. Ehlers?

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  As  far  as  fusion  is  con-
cerned,  it  used  to  be  20  to  30  years  away.  Now  it  is  30  to  40,  so
we are making progress. Just call me the Bernie Madoff of physics.

GLOBAL PARTICIPATION

I  am  sorry  I  missed  most  of  the  hearing.  I  had  four  committee
meetings  going  on  simultaneously  this  morning,  but  just  a  quick
question.  In  the  brief  time  I  have  been  here,  I  heard  a  lot  of  dif-
ferent  nations  mentioned,  but  I  haven’t  heard  Russia  mentioned,
which  I  believe  has  tremendous  coal  reserves,  and  are  they  an  ac-
tive  player  here?  The  second  is  along  the  lines  of  the  Chairman’s
question about when this is going to happen. I worry less about the
science.  We  can  do  the  science  if  we  are  willing  to  put  the  money
in.  I  worry  much  more  about  getting  acceptance  throughout  the
international community, that this is something that is fiscally and
environmentally  worth  doing.  And  is  there  any  indication  that  all
the other nations are willing to join in doing this if we do? Because
otherwise, we are, given the use of coal throughout the world, even
if we do a marvelous job in this country, it doesn’t really solve the
problem.  So  I  would  appreciate  comments  on  those  two  questions.
Ms.  FORBES.  With  respect  to  Russia,  in  the  international  CCS
meetings that I have attended, I haven’t seen Russia participating.
I don’t know that they have a demonstration planned, but there are
a  number  of  other  countries  worldwide  who  have  plans  for  dem-
onstrations  similar  to  the  FutureGen  project.  Australia  has  a
project,  China  has  a  project,  Europe  is  planning  12,  Canada  has  a
project.  So  we  do  have  quite  a  global  commitment  towards  dem-
onstrations of technology.

Mr. EHLERS. And do we have the commitment toward implemen-

tation? That is the real key.

Ms.  FORBES.  I  don’t  think  we  have  commitment  toward  imple-
mentation yet. I think we have commitment toward demonstrating
the  technology.  I  think  we  are  moving  toward  a  global  sweep  of
demonstration  projects.  I  think  implementation  is  the  next  step,
and  in  some  ways  we  have  to  talk  about  implementation  now  be-
cause  of  urgency  of  the  climate  challenge.  But  in  other  ways  you
can’t talk about it until you have at least one demonstration in the
ground.

Mr. EHLERS. I agree, but that is the part that I am very nervous
about and that was, as far as I was concerned, the failure of Kyoto
from  the  start.  I  thought  the  general  idea  of  Kyoto  was  good,  but
I  had  trouble  supporting  it  because  it  was  made  universal  and  it

doesn’t make sense that we spend billions of dollars in this country
and  many  other  countries  to  try  to  stop  something  when  other
countries are not going to do it. What we gain through our efforts,
we  lose  through  their  efforts.  So  I  think  it  is  absolutely  essential
that  there  be  strong  international  agreements  if  we  are  actually
going to proceed with this. Thank you. I yield back.

Chair BAIRD. Ms. Edwards.

INVESTMENT THROUGH 2025

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  just  an  observa-
tion that again, 2015 peak emissions if we are right about our mod-
els,  2025,  a  demonstration  project  at  some  point  of  commercializa-
tion that may or may not be successful. And so we are actually re-
lying at this time knowing that we are approaching peak CO2 emis-
sions on a technology that may or may not deliver in 2025. I mean,
so we are banking on success here, and I want to ask you actually,
I  want  you  to  think  about  failure  because  the  cost  for  failure  is
really tremendous.

Dr.  Der,  I  wonder  if  you  could  talk  to  me  for  a  moment  about,
you  know,  if  you  think  about  the  investment  between  now  and
2025,  what  that  investment  would  be?  Does  the  Department  have
any  projections  for  that  and  how  much  of  a  burden  do  taxpayers
have to meet and what is the relative risk then for private entities
and other international partners?

Dr.  DER.  That  is  a  difficult  question  to  answer  at  the  moment.
I  think  we  have  plans  in  terms  of  the  projections  of  the  research
work  and  the  demonstrations  that  are  necessary.  We  engage  with
the  private  sector  to  get  their  views  on  what  is  necessary  to  move
things  forward  in  terms  of  demonstrations  and  incentives  for  de-
ployment.  It  is  very  important  that  we  do  the  science  correctly  in
the  sequestration  area.  I  am  not  an  expert  in  it,  but  I  do  have  a
higher  degree  of  confidence  that  it  will  work  based  on  the  work
that  is  going  on  around  the  world  and  the  experts  that  are  being
put to this particular topic, people like Dr. Finley, people from the
regional  partnerships.  The  Secretary  is  also  committed  to  working
on  the  back-end  capture  costs  and  the  energy  penalties  associated
with  that,  as  well  as  the  science  in  terms  of  simulations  and  look-
ing  at  the  risk  assessments  associated  with  that.  All  these  things
need to be done as part of the research and development and dem-
onstration program. Relative to how these things get deployed and
what the private sector investment is going to be is something that
I don’t have an answer to at the moment.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  And  just  out  of  curiosity,  are  you  confident  about

your model for projecting the cost?

Dr. DER. We have a research program that sets targets in terms
of  bringing  down  those  costs  from  where  they  are  now.  We  look  at
the  research  and  the  options  that  we  have  been  pursuing,  taking
a  look  at  what  is  its  potential.  And  with  those  potentials  we  have
to change that and convert that into reality as we scale things up.
And  those  are  one  of  the  challenges  that  one  of  the  Committee
Members had also identified.

But  we  really  have  to  be  able  to  engage  the  science  and  tech-
nology to bring down the cost and also to do the modeling and the
field  work  and  all  those  things  associated  with  field  demonstra-

tions,  drawing  on  experiences  that  we  have  had  in  the  past  from
the oil and gas industry and looking at the natural analogs of CO2
that  have  been  in  the  ground  for  millions  and  millions  of  years  so
that  we  can  make  these  models  and  risk  assessment  in  going  for-
ward in time.

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Okay.  And  then  finally,  just  one  question  going
back  to  Mr.  Tonka’s  earlier  question  about  water  and  the  amount
of  water  that  you  project  that  it  will  take  to  operate  these  plants,
I  am  curious  about  electricity  and  the  amount  of  heat  that  is  re-
quired and electricity required to operate the plants and to function
and  their  estimates.  I  think  Mr.  Monroe,  in  your  testimony  esti-
mates  that  20  to  25  percent  of  the  electrical  output  is  required  for
operation.  There  are  some  estimates  I  have  seen  that  are  as  high
as 40 percent. And so if that is true, it is just really getting difficult
to see where the bargain is.

Mr.  MONROE.  Well,  your  earlier  question  talked  about  existing
plants  and  why  so  much  conversation  about  new  plants,  and  your
current  question  has  something  to  do  with  that  also.  So  if  I  go  to
an  existing  power  plant  today,  let  us  say  a  medium-sized  plant  of
500  megawatts,  I  may  lose  a  third  of  that  generating  capacity  to
add  90  percent  CO2 capture  to  that.  So  there  is  two  large  pieces
of  that.  One  is  the  heat  required  in  the  capture  process.  That  is
about  20  percent  in  round  numbers.  The  question  of  the  CO2 is
around  10  percent.  Right  now  we  would  buy  a  large  electric  motor
to compress the CO2 to get rid of it. We would actually take steam
away from the process for this heat.

We  think  in  a  new  plant,  again,  talking  conventional  coal,  that
we  may  be  able  to  integrate  that  and  drop  those  numbers  down.
Right  now  we  are  looking  at  numbers  possibly  as  only  20  percent.
So  the  new  plant  would  be  built  that  way.  IGCC  is  actually  much
less  than  that,  and  that  is  why  it  is  a  favorite  technology  for  new
plants.  We  are  building  a  new  plant  with  that.  The  FutureGen  is
proposed  for  that.  Duke  is  building  one  that  may  or  may  not  have
CO2 capture with it, and those are all sort of pioneer plants to try
to  develop  that  technology,  just  because  we  think  the  energy  and
therefore the costs for CO2 capture with that technology, as we sit
here looking today, is superior.

EFFECTS ON THE CONSUMER

Ms.  EDWARDS.  Of  course,  we  have  a  lot  of  old  plants,  and  just
lastly, Mr. Chairman, do we have any idea what that will do to the
consumer? Like how much is my electric bill going to go up because
we have made the choice to make an investment in something that
is sucking out a lot of energy to produce, you know, the carbon cap-
ture?

Mr.  MONROE.  There  is  a  lot  of  people  estimating  that,  so  I  will
talk  about  a  specific,  let  us  build  a  new  plant.  How  much  would
the cost of electricity from that plant increase with carbon capture
and  sequestration?  Based  on  some  of  the  good  work  that  the  De-
partment  of  Energy  has  done,  that  ranges  from  a  35  percent  in-
crease  to  as  much  as  an  80  percent  increase,  depending  on  the
technology,  the  high  end  or  conventional  coal  plants  like  we  are
using  today,  the  lower  end  is  with  the  gasification  plants.  So  it  is

significant,  and  that  is  really  the  reason  for  demonstrations  but
also for the basic R&D is to really attack that.

Ms. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chair  BAIRD.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Edwards.  We  are  going  to  have  a
vote  in  just  a  couple  of  minutes.  I  want  to  follow  up  with  this  line
of questions of Ms. Edwards and a bit on the line that I was asking
before.

COMPARATIVE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

If  we  look  at  the  net  expense  of  carbon  capture  sequestration
over  some  timeframe,  and  that  would  include  the  additional  cost
passed on to consumers, et cetera, the total net cost, and we consid-
ered  how  that  money—you  know,  it  is  an  opportunity  cost  kind  of
question. If we consider how that money might be spent elsewhere,
for  example,  instead  of  a  concentrated  power  network  going  out
across  the  grid,  a  distributed  power  network  kind  of  thing  Amory
Lovins  and  his  folks  have  talked  about,  how  does  that  pencil  out?
Has  anybody  thought  about  this?  Pencil  out  not  only  in  terms  of
net  economic  cost  benefit  but  also  in  terms  of  timeframe  and  car-
bon  reduction.  If  we  were  to  spend  X  amount  of  dollars  today,  we
could start reducing carbon today versus waiting this long and pre-
sumably that investment today would stimulate alternative invest-
ments in that technology be it solar, small-scale wind, geothermal,
et cetera. How does that pencil out? I mean, the people at the end
of  the  day,  they  don’t  care  whether  the  lights  turn  on  because
somewhere down the road there is a coal plant, a nuclear plant, on
the  roof  a  solar  plant,  they  want  the  lights  to  turn  on  and  their
house to be warm.

Mr. GAFFIGAN. I am holding a pencil, so I will try to answer that.
I  think  you  are  going  to  hear  on  this  committee  over  and  over
again,  don’t  pick  a  winner,  don’t  pick  a  winner  as  far  as  tech-
nologies.  In  our  view,  there  is  a  winner.  It  is  fossil  fuels,  and  it
ended  up  being  picked  for  a  reason  because  it  is  relatively  cheap
and gives the most power, whether you are talking about powering
your  automobile  or  through  electricity.  And  I  think  there  is  so
much uncertainty associated with alternatives or making a change.
But the bottom line is, it is going to cost more to do so. And I think
the  Federal  Government  has  to  consider  what  its  role  is  going  to
be  in  all  that,  and  we  have  talked  about  the  private  marketplace.
But some would argue that, you know, let us send some signals to
the  market  saying  there  is  a  rule  about  carbon,  it  is  constrained
or  it  is  priced,  and  let  the  market  try  to  sort  that  out,  so  we  can
move from a pencil to maybe some more ink. And I do think there
is  so  much  uncertainty  and  there  are  so  many  tradeoffs  with  all
these  alternatives,  whether  you  go  with  coal  in  the  future  or  you
look for wind or solar. Folks in Germany, for example, made a com-
mitment to solar but they are paying more because of it. They have
guaranteed a price for it, but that is a choice they have made. And
you  are  right,  I  don’t  know  if  this  will  be  acceptable  to  people.  If
the  PSC  today  says,  you  know,  we  are  going  to  approve  a  rate  in-
crease for carbon capture and storage, how is that going to go over
with the rate-payers?

Chair  BAIRD.  I  want  to  just  follow  up,  Mr.  Gaffigan.  You  said  in
our  view.  Does  that  mean  GAO  has  an  official  position  that—I
want to ask two questions.

Mr. GAFFIGAN. Sure.
Chair BAIRD. I am not really trying to put you on the spot, I am
just curious about this. When you talk about it relatively cheap, my
colleague, Mr. Inglis, talked about the externalized cost.

Mr. GAFFIGAN. Right. Right.
Chair  BAIRD.  It  is  relatively  cheap  if  you  externalize  the  cost.  If
you  factor  in  the  total  cost  of  ocean  acidification  and  lethal  over-
heating of the planet, it is not so relatively cheap.

Mr. GAFFIGAN. No, it is what we are actually charging for it, and
that  is  the  question  whether  we  want  to  try  to  put  a  cost  on  some
of those externalities. If we do so, then the rate-payers or somebody
is going to have to pay for it.

Chair  BAIRD.  Right.  Somebody  has  to  pay  for  it  one  way  or  the
other. You don’t get to not pay for an acidified ocean. You don’t get
to  not  pay  for  a  two  or  three  degree  Centigrade  climate  change.
You  don’t  get  to  not  pay  for  that.  That  is  going  to  happen.  The
question  is  who  is  paying  for  it  and  who  is  responsible  for  it,  and
that is not something we can pretend we don’t pay for.

Mr. GAFFIGAN. And we can spend all the money we want on tech-

nologies, but that is not going to make the difference.

Chair BAIRD. Well, I am not sure of that. Doctor?
Dr.  DER.  I  just  wanted  to  follow  up  on  the  statement  here.  The
climate  change  and  greenhouse  gas  and  CO2 emissions  is  a  global
issue, and price signals that happen in the United States or Europe
probably  put  certain  technology  out  there  at  a  certain  cost.  But  in
the  developing  economies  who  may  not  have  certain  price  signals
but continue to use coal, such as in China and India, they may not
do that. They may, but at these additional costs today it is very ex-
pensive for us. It is overwhelmingly expensive for them. Therefore,
I think the solution out of the box, if you will, really is these game-
changing  technologies  that  we  need  to  work  on  to  bring  that  cost
down  so  that  it  is  affordable  not  only  by  us,  whether  we  have  cer-
tain levels of the carbon valuation or not, but also in the developing
countries  and  economies  that  are  going  to  be  growing  and  looking
for a better standard of living.

Chair BAIRD. Mr. Inglis.

JOINING ENTREPRENEURS AND INVENTORS

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been very help-
ful  hearing  particularly  this  last  exchange  about  how  do  you  get
from  here  to  there  because,  you  know,  what  I  think  we  should  be
aware  of  is  until  we  do  what  we  have  just  been  talking  about,
which  is  attach  a  price,  there  would  be  no  reason  to  go  forward.
We  have  great  science  projects,  and  we  on  the  Science  Committee
love  science  projects.  But  until  entrepreneurs  and  inventors  are
marrying each other because a price signal has been sent that now
something  is  going  to  happen  and  you  can  make  money  doing  it,
you  can  make  money  solving  this  problem.  Until  that  happens,
nothing happens and we have hope but hope is not a strategy. And
so what I particularly offer to Dr. Der to take back to the Adminis-
tration is let us come up with something that works. As a conserv-

ative,  I  can  tell  you  that  there  is  very  little  chance  that  conserv-
atives are going to vote for a cap-and-trade system. It is a massive
tax  increase,  by  itself  is  a  massive  tax  increase.  Also,  in  the  after-
math  of  this  financial  downturn,  do  we  really  want  to  hand  over
to  Wall  Street  traders  some  credits  that  they  can  trade?  Maybe
they can turn them into derivatives, and maybe we can do a bubble
out  of  the  derivatives  and  maybe  we  can  see  what  a  wild  ride  we
get out of that.

So,  not  going  to  happen.  There  were  48  votes  for  cloture  in  the
Senate  this  summer  when  it  got  tagged  as  a  tax  increase.  In  the
midst  of  a  downturn  and  with  Wall  Street  looking  like  it  looks,
what is the chance of that number going north of 48? Answer? Not
very  much.  So  even  if  the  House  decides  to  run  it  through  the
House  just  on  a  cap-and-trade  system,  it  is  dead  on  arrival  in  the
Senate.  So  if  you  really  want  to  take  action,  you  have  got  to  find
something better, and the collaborative opportunity that I think we
have got is a revenue-neutral carbon tax if I may be so bold to sug-
gest it, where you reduce payroll taxes and you apply a tax to car-
bon, a transparent, very clear price signal, very definitive price sig-
nal.  You  know  exactly  where  we  are  going.  Entrepreneurs  and  in-
ventors  know  when  to  get  married  and  when  their  technology  can
take  out  the  incumbent  technology,  and  it  is  an  exciting  oppor-
tunity, really, to bring the best of Republican thought, conservative
thought,  which  is  how  markets  work  when  they  are  properly  ad-
justed.  In  other  words,  you  have  externalities  recognized  and  at-
tached  to  products,  and  the  best  of  Democratic  thought  which  has
for a long time been, ‘‘we have got to do something.’’

So  we  put  those  two  together  and  we  got  a  solution  that  works,
that  actually  can  get  through  the  House  and  maybe  even  through
the  Senate  and  it  could  get  by  and  then  we  could  get  this  energy
revolution to happen like it happened, as I mentioned earlier, with
the PC and the Internet.

So I am excited about the opportunity available to us if we would
be  able  to  collaborate.  If  we  try  to  run  this  thing  up  the  middle,
up  the  middle  punt  series  of  plays,  that  is  what  we  will  end  up
with, a punt.

Chair BAIRD. That is called the Seattle Seahawks.
Mr.  INGLIS.  I  went  to  Duke  for  college,  and  when  we  got  frus-
trated in the stands, that is what we would cheer about the football
team,  up  the  middle,  up  the  middle,  up  the  middle,  punt.  And  so
you  know,  that  is  what  we  are  facing  if  we  try  it  just  that  sort  of
way.  But  if  we  think  outside  the  box  and  we  hear  something  that
we  can  actually  come  together  on  and  find  a  solution,  I  have  been
talking to the new Secretary about that. I think there is a real op-
portunity  here,  and  I  hope  that  this  hearing  helps  speed  it  on.  I
went to making a speech there, Mr. Chairman, rather than asking
a question.

Chair BAIRD. Let us ask the question. Can we ask our witnesses

if they have some comments on Mr. Inglis’ thoughts here?

Mr.  GAFFIGAN.  I  would  just  wrap  up  and  say  that  I  think  they
are both important. I mean, I think technology plays a role, I think
whatever  signal  we  are  going  to  send  about  carbon  is  important,
and GAO recently did a study on the whole issue of climate change
and  talked  to  a  lot  of  experts.  They  both  agreed  that  both  play  a

118

role, the R&D role and the sending the right signals or a signal of
some  kind  that  gives  some  certainty  to  folks.  And  they  can’t  exist
without each other.

Dr.  FINLEY.  I  would  just  add  one  comment.  I  think  the  portfolio
approach  is  important.  Every  aspect  of  efficiency,  renewables,  and
carbon sequestration is necessary to get where we want to go, and
I  would  note  that  Congress  has  passed  some  very  significant  man-
dates  with  respect  to  alternative  fuels,  biofuels,  ethanol,  and  so
forth.  And  from  that  fermentation  process,  you  get  a  99  percent
pure stream of CO2 and you avoid some of the costs that Mr. Mon-
roe referred to. So let us do it incrementally. We can take pure CO2
from  a  biofuel  facility,  and  we  can  put  it  in  the  ground  now  and
let us do that sooner rather than later while we reduce the cost of
the parasitic load and the energy load on the power plants that Mr.
Monroe referred to.

Mr.  INGLIS.  You  know,  it  is  very  important,  Dr.  Finley,  you  just
mentioned the mandates. That is one way to go. The challenge with
that  is  it  is  not  as  elegant  and  efficient  as  a  pure  price  signal  be-
cause then competing technologies are out there in the private sec-
tor,  and  some  of  them  will  win  and  some  of  them  will  lose.  If  we
from up here do a mandate, and I have voted for mandates, higher
CAFE standards for example, but you don’t get the innovation, the
rapid innovation that you could get if you did it more elegantly by
price signaling.

Dr. FINLEY. I would certainly agree with your point on that. The
mandates are there and particularly as we move forward with, say,
cellulosic  or  waste  product  ethanol  type  fuels  rather  than  corn-to-
ethanol  or  food-to-ethanol  and  avoid  that  fuel  versus  food  debate,
I think there is something to be gained there and given that those
mandates were in place and presumably there are people out there
making an effort to meet them.

Mr. MONROE. We would agree. We like flexibility there, so on one
end is sort of the mandate to cap-and-trade somewhere in the mid-
dle.  We  get  some  flexibility  under  the  cap,  but  where  to  do  that?
We  like  a  pure  price  signal  so  that  new  innovations  can  come  in.
We  don’t  have  to  go  back  to  the  regulatory  sort  of  arena  to  sort  of
incorporate those and sort of like the way that spurs it so the com-
pany  has  a  large  research  staff,  and  so  we  like  really  thinking  out
of the box, and that encourages it.

Chair BAIRD. Dr. Ehlers.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  First  of  all,  let  me  say
I  will  be  happy  to  match  our  zero  to  16  Detroit  Lions  against  the
Seattle Seahawks any day. We don’t even go up the middle, we just
throw interceptions. It is much more efficient.

Chair  BAIRD.  Let  us  hope  our  energy  policy  can  exceed  both  of

those records.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Absolutely.  I  also  want  to  thank  Mr.  Inglis’  com-
ments.  He  is  always  very  thoughtful  on  these  issues,  and  he  has
thought deeply about them and what he says makes a lot of sense.
I  would  say  that  part  of  the  problem  with  the  proposed  cap-and-
trade program, it is not even a cap-and-trade program, it is a sim-
ple  tax,  it  is  an  energy  tax,  and  that  is  why  it  is  never  going  to
fly.  Cap-and-trade  in  a  pure  form  might  work  once  you  get  the
markets going, but it is not going to be easy, but if you started out

119

as  a  straight  tax,  I  agree  with  you,  it  is  destined  to  failure.  But  I
think much of what you said is valid. I think, you know, the energy
situation overall, over a 20-year period is so desperate that we real-
ly  have  to  try  every  option  possible  and  develop  the  best  approach
we  can.  And  I  think  the  marketplace  is  a  good  place  to  try  many
of the experiments. It gives you a fairly direct, fairly quick answer.
So with that, I will yield back. Thank you.

Chair  BAIRD.  I  will  just  observe  that  I  think  one  of  the  ironies
of the cap-and-trade debate has been that I think the cap-and-trade
model was put forward as a way of trying to use conservative cap-
italistic  values  to  justify  investment  in  environmental  protection
and CO2 reduction. So the incentive was there, and yet I think op-
ponents  of  it  are  coming  from  the  same  side  that  it  was  designed
to  appeal  to.  And  my  own  leaning  is  much  more  toward  the  line
of  Mr.  Inglis.  The  only  thing  I  would  observe  on  that  is  it  is  easy
to denigrate any form of tax because the indirect form, externalized
form  of  tax  government  doesn’t  impose,  nature  imposes  on  it,  and
nature  may  actually  impose  a  much  higher  rate  of  taxation  in  the
form of consequences if we don’t tax ourselves to try to reduce CO2
and other gas emissions.

This  has  been  a  very,  very  informative  discussion.  We  are  very
grateful for all of your time, and I thank very much my colleagues
for  their  thoughtful  input  as  well.  And  with  that  then,  with  the
buzzing  going  off,  the  hearing  will  stand  adjourned  again  with  the
gratitude of the Committee. Thank you very much.

[Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Ms.  Sarah  M.  Forbes,  Senior  Associate,  Climate  and  Energy  Program,

World Resources Institute

Questions submitted by Chair Bart Gordon
Q1. Building a network of carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstrations will re-
quire  international  collaboration.  This  makes  sense  to  ensure  that  CCS  dem-
onstrations  around  the  globe  are  diverse  and  demonstrate  the  full  suite  of  cap-
ture and storage options. In your view, how do we best accomplish this? Is there
a specific federal agency best equipped to take the lead on international collabo-
ration on CCS demonstrations?

A1. The  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum
(CSLF)  includes  the  right  structure  for  a  global  network  of  carbon  dioxide  capture
and storage (CCS) demonstrations. It benefits from ministerial-level support and in-
cludes key coal-consuming countries; however, global interest and action on CCS has
quickly  advanced  and  the  existing  framework  must  be  updated  and  formally  en-
dorsed by Congress. The following actions are needed to leverage the past activities
of  the  CSLF  and  move  toward  new  mechanisms  that  facilitate  successful  inter-
national collaboration:

• Establish  a  CCS  demonstration  technology  alliance  for  countries  working  on
demonstrations, whereby a formal network is established to share information
among projects and ensure that information is publicly available. This should
be  a  new  initiative,  led  by  the  Energy  Department,  building  on  the  success
of  CSLF  activities  and  including  the  CSLF  member  countries.  It  should  be
launched in collaboration with the Australian-led Global Carbon Capture and
Storage Institute and possibly the International Energy Agency.

• Increase the number of full time technical staff devoted to international CCS
collaboration within the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy. This
allocation can ensure that existing bilateral agreements result in concrete ac-
tions  and  that  activities  are  scientifically  and  technically  robust.  This  tech-
nical group should be adequately funded and given a high priority.

• Establish  a  multi-agency  task  force  to  steer  international  CCS  collaborations
and  advise  the  CCS  Technology  Demonstration  Alliance.  The  task  force
should  be  led  by  the  Energy  Department,  but  also  include  participation  from
the Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Treasury
Department. The task force should meet quarterly.

Q2. In  your  testimony,  you  mention  that  moving  forward  with  CCS  worldwide  will
require  significant  investment.  What  actions  would  you  recommend  the  Federal
Government  should  take  to  ensure  that  a  clear  and  robust  international  financ-
ing mechanism exists for large-scale CCS demonstration projects?

A2. Governments  worldwide  are  moving  toward  CCS  demonstration  by  committing
funding  to  demonstrations.  Within  the  past  month,  requests  for  proposals  for  CCS
demonstrations have been made by the European Commission1 and the U.S. Depart-
ment  of  Energy2 as  part  of  the  recently  passed  stimulus  packages  at  EUR  1.05B
and  USD  2.4B,  respectively.  Australia’s  budget  discussions3 have  also  included  dis-
cussion of allocating AUD 2B toward 2–4 CCS demonstrations, and the UK’s Energy
Secretary  announced  a  plan  to  subsidize  four  demonstrations.4 Although  this  fund-
ing  is  significant,  there  is  (1)  a  lack  of  funding  dedicated  to  demonstrations  of  CCS
at commercial scales in the U.S., (2) insufficient funding globally to achieve the goal
of 20 demonstrations worldwide, and (3) barriers to obtaining public and private sec-
tor  investment  in  the  technology  that  must  be  overcome  to  achieve  demonstrations
and supplement government subsidies.

Specific actions this committee could take to provide clarity toward public and pri-

vate sector investment and international collaboration on demonstrations include:

• Develop  a  multi-agency  task  force  to  study  and  formally  recommend  inter-
national CCS financing mechanisms. The task force should include participa-

tion  from  the  State  Department,  Department  of  Energy,  the  Environmental

• Request  that  this  task  force  prepare  (within  120  days)  a  report  to  Congress
on  international  financing  mechanisms  for  CCS  that  provide  clear  rec-
ommendations  on  international  government  funding  (consider  pairing/twin-
ning  or  co-funding  demonstration  projects  with  other  countries),  outlines  the
role  of  multilateral  banks,  and  presents  solutions  to  the  obstacles  to  private-
sector investment in CCS.

The Passing of FutureGen:

How the World’s Premier Clean Coal

Technology Project Came to be Abandoned

by the Department of Energy

REPORT BY THE MAJORITY STAFF OF THE

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT
OF THE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO

CHAIRMAN BART GORDON AND

SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BRAD MILLER

MARCH 10, 2009

Executive Summary

When President George W. Bush announced the FutureGen initiative in February
of  2003,  he  described  it  as  a  10-year,  $1  billion,  government/private  partnership  to
build  a  coal-based,  zero-emissions  electricity  and  hydrogen  producing  power  plant.
It  would  provide  the  American  people  and  the  world  with  advanced  technologies
that would help meet the world’s energy needs, and would improve the global envi-
ronment  for  future  generations.  Spencer  Abraham,  then-Secretary  of  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  (DOE),  went  even  further.  This  ‘‘bold  step’’  would  turn  coal  from
an  ‘‘environmentally  challenging  energy  resource  into  an  environmentally  benign
one’’ and demonstrate the best technologies the world had to offer.

The  plant  would  not  use  traditional  coal  technology,  but  would  be  an  integrated
gasification  combined  cycle/carbon  capture  and  storage  (IGCC/CCS)  facility  built  at
the  commercial  scale  of  275  megawatts.  It  would  sequester  one  million  metric  tons
of carbon dioxide per year, produce both electricity and hydrogen as energy sources
and  demonstrate  the  integration  of  commercial  and  untested  technologies.  Its  re-
sults  would  be  shared  with  all  participants,  including  international  parties,  indus-
try,  the  environmental  community  and  the  public.  International  participation  was
a  core  component  of  the  project  as  acceptance  of  the  project’s  results  were  deemed
necessary by the Administration for building an international consensus on the role
of coal and carbon sequestration in addressing global climate change and energy se-
curity.

But in December of 2007, after a site in Illinois was selected by FutureGen’s pri-
vate  industrial  partners,  the  environmental  impact  statement  required  by  the  Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act was completed, and the State of Illinois had accept-
ed  liability  for  the  sequestration  aspect  of  the  project,  then-DOE  Secretary  Samuel
Bodman  announced  that  he  intended  to  restructure  FutureGen.  He  would  ‘‘maxi-
mize’’  the  private  sector  role  and  prevent  further  cost  escalation.  The  restructured
FutureGen  was  rolled  out  at  the  end  of  January  of  2008,  but  it  was  widely  viewed
as  the  death  of  the  Bush  initiative.  Subsequent  events  have  verified  that  view,  as
the four applications—two of which have been deemed ineligible—responding to the
new  competition  bear  no  resemblance  to  the  original  FutureGen  and  have  no  capa-
bility to meet the original goals.

How  did  such  a  highly  publicized  Presidential  initiative  fail,  and  what  were  its
consequences?  Committee  staff  review  of  thousands  of  documents  produced  by  the
Department  of  Energy  over  the  past  several  months1 has  resulted  in  the  following
conclusions:

1. Based  on  how  easily  the  Department  of  Energy  abandoned  the  FutureGen
project,  it  appears  that  President  Bush,  Secretary  Bodman  and  the  Office  of  Man-
agement  and  Budget  were  never  fully  committed  to  the  FutureGen  project  or  its
goal  of  developing  technology  to  allow  the  use  of  coal  without  massive  emissions  of
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and pollutants. In retrospect, FutureGen
appears  to  have  been  nothing  more  than  a  public  relations  ploy  for  Bush  Adminis-

1 DOE was extremely reluctant to produce documents to the Committee so that it could deter-
mine exactly how decisions were made concerning FutureGen. Despite numerous requests from
the  Committee  since  April  2,  2008,  and  the  threat  of  a  subpoena,  the  Department  has  still  not
yet provided a full response. Many of the withheld documents involve communications with the
White House and this situation has required repeated meetings to examine those materials. We
should add that Undersecretary Albright routinely destroyed his e-mail records, further compli-
cating  the  ability  of  the  staff  to  reconstruct  the  full  history  on  decision-making  regarding
FutureGen.

tration officials to make it appear to the public and the world that the United States
was  doing  something  to  address  global  warming  despite  its  refusal  to  ratify  the
Kyoto  Protocol.2 When  worldwide  construction  costs  went  up  across  the  board,  nei-
ther the White House nor DOE was willing to make the additional financial commit-
ment necessary to keep the project going. Secretary Bodman, in particular, strongly
disliked  FutureGen,  and  neither  President  Bush  nor  any  of  his  White  House  staff
did  anything  to  stop  Bodman  from  killing  the  original  project  or  restructuring  it  in
a way that was guaranteed to fail. As an assistant to Under Secretary Bud Albright
put it during a discussion of restructuring FutureGen:

‘‘[E]veryone  is  conveniently  forgetting  that  we’re  here  b/c  [because]  S–1  [Sec-
retary  Bodman]  wants  to  kill  FG  as  its  [sic]  currently  contemplated  with  or
without a Plan B.’’ 3

2. Bodman’s  primary  stated  reason  for  killing  the  original  FutureGen  plan  was
that  the  cost  had  doubled  to  $1.8  billion.  That  was  false,  and  an  inexcusable  error
for  the  head  of  a  federal  agency.  Bodman  and  his  staff  obtained  that  number  by
comparing  the  cost  estimate  of  $952  million  in  constant  FY  2004  dollars  with  the
‘‘as spent’’ dollars—which is always higher because it includes normal inflation and
other  cost  increases—that  all  federal  agencies  use  when  estimating  the  actual  cost
of multi-year projects such as FutureGen. The Office of Fossil Energy attempted nu-
merous times to explain to DOE’s policy staff the difference between these two num-
bers, but as Under Secretary Bud Albright’s Chief of Staff cavalierly explained while
preparing  talking  points  for  Bodman,  ‘‘this  is  not  a  legal  document,  it  is  a  commu-
nications  document.  As  for  whether  the  escalation  costs  after  2004  were  expected
or not, why does that even matter?’’ 4

It is difficult to believe that anyone working at the top levels of DOE or the White
House,  both  of  which  deal  with  many  multi-year  clean-up,  research  and  defense
projects—particularly  someone  with  Bodman’s  business  background—did  not  know
the  difference  between  ‘‘constant’’  and  ‘‘as  spent’’  dollars  or  even  ask  how  the  $1.8
billion  figure  was  obtained.  But  there  is  no  evidence  that  anyone  asked  that  basic
question.

3. Secretary  Bodman  should  have  known  that  his  claims  that  the  restructured
FutureGen  would  accomplish  all  of  the  goals  of  the  original  plan  and  would  speed
the use of CCS technology were false Bodman and his senior deputies—Deputy Sec-
retary  Clay  Sell  and  Under  Secretary  Albright—demanded  that  DOE  staff  create
documents for the White House saying the new plan would cost less taxpayer money
and  do  more  to  validate  new  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  technologies  in  a
shorter time frame than the original FutureGen. This work was largely overseen by
political  appointees  working  under  Sell  and  Albright.  These  claims  were  concocted
without consulting the industry that was expected to take up the FutureGen mantle
and  despite  the  repeated  warnings  of  career  DOE  staff  to  the  political  leadership
of the Department that the project would fail to meet the original goals. Career staff
produced a summary analysis by December 2007 that was entitled, ‘‘What ‘‘Plan B’’
would  NOT  accomplish’’  (emphasis  in  original).  The  concluding  paragraphs  are  so
compelling that they are worth quoting at length:

Given the above delays [following analysis of how Plan B would slow technology
development  and  deployment],  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  proceeding  with
‘‘Plan B’’ and without FutureGen, the availability of affordable coal fueled CCS
plants would be delayed at least 10 years and will not allow widespread deploy-
ment of CCS until near 2040. Affordable CCS technologies will not be available
in  time  to  meet  the  expected  turnover  of  the  existing  fleet  of  coal  power  plants
in  the  U.S.,  nor  for  incorporation  into  the  development  of  the  world’s  massive
coal resources in countries such as China and India.
Based  on  the  DOE  Climate  Change  Task  Force  analysis,  which  was  the  basis
for  the  FY09  DOE  budget  request,  a  delay  of  ten  years  in  the  deployment  of
fossil technology with CCS would result in a cumulative loss of emission reduc-
tions  of  about  22  billion  tons  CO2 through  2100  in  the  U.S.  To  put  this  into
perspective,  current  U.S.  total  annual  CO2 emissions  are  six  billion  tons;  U.S.

in  a  hearing  on  September  20,  2006,  ‘‘Department  of  Energy’s  Plan  for  Climate  Change  Tech-
nology  Programs.’’  The  Departmental  witness  stated  that  ‘‘CCTP’s  portfolio  includes  realigned
activities  as  well  as  new  initiatives,  such  as  the  President’s  Advanced  Energy  and  Hydrogen
Fuel Initiatives, carbon sequestration, and FutureGen,’’ p. 21.

annual CO2 emissions from coal are two billion tons. The DOE Task Force fur-
ther estimated that CCS benefits from the proposed initiative for the rest of the
world were about six times the U.S. benefits, or on the order of 150 billion tons
CO2 through  2100  worldwide  that  would  not  be  avoided  if  ‘‘Plan  B’’  were  cho-
sen.5

4. The  anemic  response  by  industry  to  the  competition  to  participate  in  the  new
FutureGen proved in a real world demonstration how wrong Bodman and his depu-
ties  were.  There  were  four  responses  of  which  two  were  ineligible  and  two  were  in-
complete. None proposed to construct the IGCC/CCS, coal-based, zero-emission elec-
tricity  and  hydrogen  producing  power  plant  that  had  been  promised  by  Secretary
Bodman  in  January  of  2008.  The  industry  response  to  a  Request  for  Information
and the draft FOA had reduced the restructured program to a competition for tech-
nology  that  would  attempt  to  sequester  a  smaller  amount  of  carbon  dioxide,  either
as part of a newly constructed plant or as a ‘‘bolt on’’ to an existing plant.

But  by  the  time  the  career  staff  were  proven  right,  Bodman  and  President  Bush
were at the end of their tenure, the scheduled project selection date had passed, and
the United States had lost a year, at minimum, in developing and deploying carbon
capture and sequestration technologies.

5. The Bush Administration’s abrupt cancellation of the original FutureGen with-
out  bothering  to  consult  or  even  warn  the  four  countries  (India,  Australia,  South
Korea,  and  China)  which  had  signed  on  as  project  partners  severely  damaged  the
United  States’  reputation  as  an  international  science  partner.  The  South  Korean
Minister for Commerce, Industry and Energy wrote on February 4, 2008 (three days
after receiving a cancellation notice from Secretary Bodman):

‘‘I  am  really  surprised  that  I  had  no  prior  explanation  of  that  restructuring  in-
tention  from  DOE  . . ..  If  you  have  recognized  all  Korea’s  endeavor  regarding
the  project,  it  is  not  the  appropriate  way  to  deliver  U.S.  DOE’s  intention  to  re-
structure FutureGen by sending me an e-mail.’’ 6

Foreign  partners  weren’t  the  only  ones  surprised  by  DOE’s  change  of  direction.
Cancellation  of  the  project,  and  the  abandonment  of  the  growing  coalition  of  coun-
tries  supporting  the  project,  also  allowed  the  technology  lead  in  this  important  en-
deavor  to  move  to  other  countries.  Carbon  capture  and  sequestration  projects  are
now  going  forward  in  Australia,  China  (former  partners)  and  Europe.  Other  coun-
tries  no  longer  look  to  the  United  States  for  leadership  in  this  area,  and,  as  senior
DOE officials acknowledged to one another, the restructured program had no inter-
national component built into it.7

6. Creating  ‘‘clean  coal’’  is  an  extremely  complex  task  involving  not  only  the  de-
velopment of reliable and economical technology to capture carbon dioxide and other
pollutants,  and  integrating  it  into  electricity-producing  coal  plants,  but  also  the  ac-
ceptance of higher electricity prices and unknown liability for carbon dioxide seques-
tration  sites  by  the  public  and  their  elected  officials  worldwide.  Without  a  carbon
regulation structure in place, it is almost impossible to expect power generators and
utilities  to  take  on  this  ‘‘public  benefit’’  task  without  expecting  a  return  on  invest-
ment,  something  that  the  Bush  Administration  refused  to  acknowledge,  much  less
address.  This  guaranteed  that  Secretary  Bodman’s  efforts  during  the  summer  and
autumn  of  2007  to  convince  industry  to  sign  up  for  more  risk  in  the  original
FutureGen  project  would  be  a  non-starter.  FutureGen  was  a  high-risk  effort  to  de-
velop and demonstrate innovative technologies for carbon capture and sequestration.
Without  a  regulatory  environment  requiring  firms  to  use  such  technologies,  there
was  little  reason—beyond  calculations  of  public  relations—for  private  companies  to
commit any more than they already had on FutureGen.

When  the  Department  of  Energy’s  top  managers  were  attempting  to  restructure
FutureGen,  a  senior  career  official  from  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  described  the
new  project  as  a  Frankenstein.8 The  analogy  to  the  creation  of  a  monster  which

FutureGen program.

could not be controlled by its creator was not quite accurate. But the idea that ‘‘Plan
B’’ was a cobbled together mess of left-over parts was not far off the mark. However,
what DOE really created was more of a Humpty Dumpty. Just like Humpty Dump-
ty,  when  FutureGen  fell  off  the  wall  in  its  ‘‘restructured’’  form,  it  broke  apart,  and
all  of  DOE’s  press  releases  and  PowerPoint  presentations  couldn’t  put  it  back  to-
gether again.9

The Origins of FutureGen

In  his  State  of  the  Union  address  in  January  of  2003,  President  George  W.  Bush
unveiled  his  ‘‘Hydrogen  Fuels  Initiative,’’  otherwise  known  as  a  hydrogen-powered,
noxious emissions-free car called the ‘‘Freedom Car.’’ He committed $1.7 billion over
the  next  10  years  for  research  on  car  technology  and  fuel  distribution.  But  where
would  the  hydrogen  fuel  come  from?  In  the  volume  required  by  the  transportation
sector, it could only come from coal or natural gas.10 And thus was born FutureGen.
A month later, on February 27, 2003, the President announced with great fanfare
the  Integrated  Sequestration  and  Hydrogen  Research  Initiative,  a  10-year,  $1  bil-
lion, government/private partnership to build a coal-based, zero-emissions electricity
and  hydrogen  producing  power  plant.  ‘‘This  demonstration  project  and  the  Carbon
Sequestration Leadership Forum will build on these initiatives to provide the Amer-
ican  people  and  the  world  with  advanced  technologies  to  meet  the  world’s  energy
needs,  while  improving  our  global  environment  for  future  generations,’’  he  prom-
ised.11 ‘‘It  will  be  the  cleanest  fossil  fuel-fired  power  plant  in  the  world,’’  a  contem-
poraneous  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  publication  claimed  and  was  a  ‘‘direct  re-
sponse  to  the  President’s  Climate  Change  and  Hydrogen  Fuels  Initiatives.’’ 12 Ac-
cording to then-DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham, the project would ‘‘help turn coal
from  an  environmentally  challenging  energy  resource  into  an  environmentally  be-
nign  one.’’ 13 It  would  be  ‘‘one  of  the  boldest  steps  our  nation  has  taken  toward  a
pollution-free  energy  future  . . ..  The  prototype  power  plant  will  serve  as  the  test
bed for demonstrating the best technologies the world has to offer,’’ Abraham prom-
ised.14

The announcement was made jointly by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the
Department of State to emphasize the core objective of international cooperation. At
the  same  time,  the  two  agencies  announced  the  creation  of  the  Carbon  Sequestra-
tion Leadership Forum (CSLF), an international panel which would focus on carbon
capture  and  sequestration.15 All  these  initiatives  were  in  large  part  a  response  to
President  Bush’s  desire  to  show  that  the  United  States  was  engaged  in  efforts  to
reduce  global  warming  even  though  it  had  refused  to  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  be-
cause of the generous greenhouse gas emission limits for developing countries. They
were hailed by the business press as a ‘‘viable alternative to Kyoto.’’ 16

The  275-megawatt,  prototype  zero  emissions  plant  subsequently  known  as
‘‘FutureGen’’ would be a ‘‘living laboratory’’ to test new clean power, carbon capture
and  coal-to-hydrogen  technologies.  The  DOE  release  went  on  to  say  that  President
Bush  had  already  emphasized  the  importance  of  technology  in  stabilizing  green-
house  gas  concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  with  two  major  previous  policy  an-
nouncements: the National Climate Change Technology Initiative on June 11, 2001,
and  the  Global  Climate  Change  Initiative  on  February  13,  2002.  ‘‘Carbon  capture
and  sequestration  technologies  likely  will  be  essential  to  meeting  the  President’s
goals. Without them, it will be virtually impossible to limit global carbon emissions,’’
DOE stated.

9 Humpty  Dumpty’s  ability  to  create  new  meanings  for  words  in  Lewis  Carroll’s  Through  the
Looking Glass also bears some relationship to Secretary Bodman’s attempt to create something
new while still calling it ‘‘FutureGen’’ so that, technically, he could say the President’s initiative
was  alive.  ‘‘When  I  use  a  word,’’  Humpty  Dumpty  said  in  a  rather  a  scornful  tone,  ‘‘it  means
just  what  I  choose  it  to  mean—neither  more  nor  less.’’  ‘‘The  question  is,’’  said  Alice,  ‘‘whether
you can make words mean different things.’’ ‘‘The question is,’’ replied Humpty Dumpty, ‘‘which
is to be master—that’s all.’’a

Moreover,  the  President’s  Hydrogen  Fuels  Initiative  envisioned  ‘‘the  ultimate
transformation  of  the  Nation’s  transportation  fleet  from  a  reliance  on  petroleum  to
the  use  of  clean-burning  hydrogen,’’  DOE  said.  Although  most  hydrogen  in  the
United  States  and  about  half  of  the  world’s  hydrogen  supply  were  currently  pro-
duced  from  natural  gas,  ‘‘The  new  technologies  to  be  integrated  into  the  prototype
plant  will  expand  the  options  for  producing  hydrogen  from  coal,  providing  a  more
diversified  and  secure  source  of  feedstocks  for  the  President’s  initiative’’  (emphasis
added).17

Virtually  every  aspect  of  the  prototype  plant  would  employ  cutting-edge  tech-
nology. It would not use ‘‘traditional coal technology,’’ but be based on a coal gasifi-
cation system to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen would be used
for  electric  power  generation  or  as  a  feedstock  for  refineries.  ‘‘In  the  future,  as  hy-
drogen-power automobiles and trucks are developed as part of President Bush’s Hy-
drogen Fuels Initiative, the plant could be a source of transportation-grade hydrogen
fuel.’’  New  technologies  would  be  used  to  capture  the  carbon  dioxide,  and  it  would
be sequestered in a geologic formation that would be intensively monitored to verify
the permanence of the storage.18

The goals of the project were extremely ambitious. DOE and its partners were to:
1. Design,  construct  and  operate  a  275-megawatt  prototype  plant  that  produced
electricity and hydrogen with near-zero emissions. The size of the plant was driven
by a need to provide commercially relevant data and produce one million tons of car-
bon dioxide (CO2) necessary to validate the ‘‘integrated operation of the gasification
plant and the receiving geologic formation.’’

2. Sequester  at  least  90  percent  of  the  CO2 emissions,  prove  the  effectiveness,
safety and permanence of the sequestration and establish standardized technologies
and protocols for CO2 measuring, monitoring and verification.

3. Validate  the  engineering,  economic  and  environmental  viability  of  ‘‘advanced
coal-based,  near-zero  emission  technologies’’  that  by  2020  would  produce  electricity
with less than a 10 percent increase in cost; and produce hydrogen at $4 per million
Btus or less than the wholesale price of gasoline.19

The  industry  and  the  environmental  community  expressed  skepticism  from  the
outset.  Coal  gasification  to  produce  electricity  is  ‘‘still  an  edgy  technology,’’  one  ex-
pert  said,  and  extracting  hydrogen  from  coal  wasted  30  percent  of  the  fuel’s  latent
energy. The budget and schedule were viewed as tight ‘‘even for a conventional coal-
fired  power  plant.’’  One  environmentalist  said  until  the  administration  supported  a
‘‘binding  program’’  to  limit  carbon  emissions,  the  private  sector  would  not  commit
‘‘real  money’’  to  solving  the  problem.20 But  if  the  project  reduced  the  cost  of  carbon
dioxide  sequestration  from  $100  to  $300  per  ton  to  $10  or  less,  it  would  save  the
U.S. ‘‘trillions of dollars’’ to meet the inevitable carbon regulations.21

By  the  end  of  2003,  DOE’s  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  (FE),  which  had  the  lead  on
the  project,  had  prepared  the  mission  need  statement  required  for  the  acquisition
of  a  capital  asset.  It  focused  on  the  necessity  to  integrate  the  operation  of  a  coal-
based hydrogen/power facility with carbon dioxide sequestration, something that the
existing  clean  coal  research  program—which  addressed  the  development  of  compo-
nents  and  subsystems—did  not  do.  To  sufficiently  consider  the  feasibility  of  the
zero-emissions concept, DOE had to address the integration gap ‘‘to prove technical
operational  viability  to  the  conservative  coal  and  utility  industry.’’ 22 The  expecta-
tion  was  that  FutureGen  would  be  sufficiently  successful  that  when  the  aging  fleet
of coal plants was retired in the 2020–2040 time frame, there would be a viable zero
emissions coal option.23

In  the  need  statement,  FE  evaluated  and  rejected  six  alternative  approaches  to
achieve  President  Bush’s  goal.  In  particular,  it  rejected  the  option  of  a  large-scale
demonstration  of  commercial  technology  by  the  power  industry.  ‘‘This  alternative
would  require  the  immediate  integration  of  a  number  of  complex  commercial-scale

power  plant  component  technologies,  and  operation  and  integration  will  be  tech-
nically  challenging  and  risky  from  an  industry  perspective.’’  Moreover,  the  seques-
tration had not yet been demonstrated. Such an approach would not be cost-effective
and  without  legislated  carbon  constraints,  ‘‘the  industry  has  no  incentive  to  invest
its  limited  capital  in  this  demonstration  and  pursue  this  high-risk  course  of  ac-
tion.’’ 24

The acquisition strategy for a research and development project was conditionally
approved by DOE’s deputy and undersecretaries in November of 2003 and fully ap-
proved in April of 2004. Congress provided $9 million to initiate FutureGen, but also
asked for a report on funding and cost sharing.25 The goals and the Administration’s
plans  for  achieving  them  were  more  fully  outlined  in  the  program  plan  submitted
to Congress in March of 2004 as required in the Department of Interior and Related
Agencies Appropriation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108–108). The cost share would be 74 per-
cent  government  and  26  percent  private—well  above  the  20  percent  commitment
from  the  private  sector  normally  required  for  research  and  development  projects.26
In  the  plan,  DOE  told  Congress  that  FutureGen  ‘‘directly’’  addresses  one  of  the
four  strategic  goals  in  its  2003  Strategic  Plan:  to  protect  national  and  economic  se-
curity by ‘‘promoting a diverse supply and delivery of reliable, affordable, and envi-
ronmentally  sound  energy.’’  Through  use  of  efficient  generation  technologies  and
carbon  sequestration,  FutureGen  would  eliminate  environmental  barriers  and  en-
able  the  continued  use  of  domestic  coal.  It  would  also  produce  hydrogen  for  trans-
portation to support President Bush’s hydrogen fuel initiative and provide a ‘‘unique
real-world opportunity to prove the feasibility of large-scale carbon sequestration, a
key potential strategy to reduce the risks of climate change.’’ Absent this ‘‘zero-emis-
sion option . . ., coal’s contribution to the Nation’s energy mix could be severely cur-
tailed, thus limiting the fuel diversity of our electricity supply portfolio, and increas-
ing our dependence on more expensive and less secure sources of energy.’’ 27

Defined  as  a  ‘‘public  benefits-driven’’  investment  in  ‘‘high-risk,  high-return  tech-
nology  that  private  companies  alone  cannot  undertake’’  FutureGen’s  integration  of
concepts and components would be the

key to proving technical and operational viability to the generally conservative,
risk-adverse coal and utility industries. Integration issues such as the dynamics
between  upstream  and  downstream  subsystems  . . .  can  only  be  addressed  by
a  large-scale  integrated  facility  operation.  Unless  the  production  of  hydrogen
and  electricity  from  coal  integrated  with  sequestering  carbon  dioxide  can  be
shown  to  be  feasible  and  cost  competitive,  the  coal  industry  will  not  make  the
investments necessary to fully realize the potential energy security and economic
benefits of this plentiful, domestic energy resource (emphasis added).

FutureGen  would  combine  high-risk  research  activities,  advanced  generation  coal
gasification technology integrated with combined cycle electricity generation, hydro-
gen  production,  and  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.  It  would  take  at  least  10
years to accomplish its goals, and the results would be shared with participants, in-
dustry, the environmental community, international partners and the public. ‘‘Broad
engagement of stakeholders early on in FutureGen is critical to achieving an under-
standing  and  acceptance  of  sequestration  and  zero-emission  coal  utilization,’’  DOE
stated.28

While  its  goals  and  schedule  were  recognized  as  aggressive  and  high-risk,  they
were judged achievable and would prove ‘‘the basis for a potentially huge long-term
public benefit.’’ And DOE determined that it was not possible ‘‘to reach FutureGen’s
stretch goals using off-the-shelf commercial technology.’’ Critical components needed
to be designed, and their efficiencies, environmental performance reliability and eco-
nomics  needed  to  be  advanced  and  tested.  More  importantly,  ‘‘[a]  key  piece  of
FutureGen is proving the viability of sequestration and its integration with a power

facility.’’ 29 Full-scale  operation  with  continuous  power  generation  was  projected  by
FY 2012.30

Furthermore, according to White House officials, the hydrogen transportation ini-
tiative and FutureGen were investments that would achieve ‘‘both goals of address-
ing climate change and protecting our economy.’’ 31

In 2005, after The New York Times alleged that industry would not spend money
to  reduce  emissions  under  a  voluntary  system  that  gave  a  competitive  advantage
to those companies that did nothing, Samuel Bodman, the new DOE Secretary, reit-
erated  the  Department’s  support  for  FutureGen.32 President  Bush  also  featured  it
prominently  in  a  2005  ‘‘fact  sheet’’  concerning  how  he  was  addressing  climate
change.  In  December  of  2005,  Bodman  announced  an  agreement  with  an  industry
consortium  called  the  FutureGen  Industrial  Alliance,  to  build  FutureGen,  ‘‘a  proto-
type  of  the  fossil-fueled  power  plant  of  the  future.’’  He  described  it  as  a  direct  re-
sponse to President Bush’s directive to develop a hydrogen economy by ‘‘drawing on
the  best  scientific  research  to  address  the  issue  of  global  climate  change.’’  Bodman
lavishly  praised  the  Alliance  members,  who  would  contribute  $250  million  to  the
project,  as  among  ‘‘the  world’s  most  responsible  and  forward  thinking  coal  and  en-
ergy companies.’’ At the heart of the project—described as a ‘‘stepping-stone toward
future  coal-fired  power  plants’’—would  be  coal-gasification  technologies  that  could
eliminate  air  pollutants  and  mercury.  Carbon  sequestration  would  be  a  key  feature
with  the  goal  of  capturing  90  percent  of  the  plant’s  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  The
‘‘ultimate goal for the FutureGen plant is to show how new technology can eliminate
environmental concerns over the future use of coal and allow the Nation to tape the
full potential of its coal reserves,’’ Bodman said.33

By  January  of  2006,  the  project  now  known  as  FutureGen  was  no  longer  being
promoted as a source of transportation-grade fuels, perhaps because the Administra-
tion  had  realized  that  commercially  viable  hydrogen-powered  cars  were  some  dec-
ades away.34 FutureGen was now to integrate advanced coal gasification technology,
hydrogen  from  coal,  power  generation,  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  capture  and  geo-
logic storage. ‘‘The success of FutureGen will assure that coal, a low-cost, abundant,
and  geographically  diverse  energy  resource,  continues  to  globally  supply  exception-
ally clean energy.’’ 35

The project appeared to be going well in this time frame—at least publicly. A pre-
liminary agreement with the Alliance was signed on December 2, 2005.36 President
Bush  referred  to  it  in  his  2006  State  of  the  Union  address  as  part  of  his  Advanced
Energy Initiative.37 Participation by foreign governments was expected.38 Its cost in
FY  2005  constant  dollars  was  $952  million.39 According  to  DOE’s  Assistant  Sec-

retary  for  fossil  energy,  ‘‘the  FutureGen  project  is  being  pursued  aggressively  and
is  on  schedule.’’ 40 It  was  a  ‘‘high  priority,’’  James  Connaughton,  Chairman  of  the
White House Council on Environmental Quality and the President’s senior environ-
mental and natural resources adviser, stated in late 2006.41 By April of 2007, a first
phase  cooperative  agreement  had  been  signed  which  would  include  work  on  siting,
scoping,  conceptual  design  and  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  compli-
ance. The Alliance had selected four sites as finalists, and the winning site was ex-
pected to be announced in mid- to late 2007.42

The significance of the FutureGen project on the international stage could not be
underestimated.  After  his  refusal  to  submit  the  Kyoto  Protocol  to  the  Senate  for
ratification,  President  Bush  and  his  advisers  touted  the  highly  visible  project  as  a
way  to  attack  the  problem  of  global  warming  in  the  voluntary,  cooperative  inter-
national manner that was a hallmark of the Bush approach to environmental prob-
lems. CEQ Chairman Connaughton, who had the task of defending the Bush Admin-
istration,  did  so  by  promoting  international  partnerships  for  sustainable  growth,  of
which  FutureGen  was  one.43 It  was  particularly  important  in  U.S.  relationships
with India and China, both of which signed on as partners in the FutureGen project
even  before  the  cooperative  agreement  with  the  Alliance  was  completed.  A  ‘‘U.S.-
India  Energy  Dialogue’’  was  established  by  Secretary  Bodman  and  Montek  Singh
Ahluwalia,  Deputy  Chairman  of  India’s  Planning  Commission,  in  2005.  By  May  of
2006, India had become the first foreign country to sign on as a FutureGen partner.
According  to  Senate  testimony  in  2007  by  David  Pumphrey,  then  DOE  Deputy  As-
sistant  Secretary  for  international  energy  cooperation,  ‘‘successfully  demonstrating
and adopting this technology will allow India to reduce the intensity of future green-
house gas emissions from the burning of their abundant coal resources.’’ 44

In  September  of  2006,  President  Bush  and  President  Hu  Jintao  of  China  agreed
to  create  a  ‘‘Strategic  Economic  Dialogue’’  (SED)  between  the  two  countries  which
would  be  convened  semi-annually.  Treasury  Secretary  Henry  Paulson  would  lead
the U.S. side of the dialogue, and the Energy Department would dialogue with Chi-
na’s  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  on  energy  policy.45 In  Decem-
ber of 2006, China—the second largest producer of CO2 after the U.S.—became the
third  foreign  country  (South  Korea  was  the  second)  to  join  the  FutureGen  Govern-
ment  Steering  Committee.  China  Huaneng  Group,  the  country’s  largest  coal-fueled
power  generator,  had  already  joined  the  Alliance.  According  to  Pumphrey,  the  U.S.
‘‘assigned a high priority to maintaining long-term technical cooperation with China
on  fossil  energy  issues,’’  including  FutureGen.  The  FutureGen  concept  could  dem-
onstrate technologies that would reduce carbon emissions worldwide.46

The Cost Issue

By early 2007, however, DOE management internally was raising questions about
the  cost  of  FutureGen.  Even  before  the  Full  Scope  Cooperative  Agreement  was
signed,  DOE  headquarters  was  expressing 
its  discontent  to  the  Alliance.
FutureGen’s  as-spent  cost  projection,  which  included  inflation  and  the  increasing
cost  of  construction  and  materials,  was  $1.8  billion  and  global  construction  costs
were rising. In light of those anticipated cost increases, DOE was balking at paying
74  percent  of  any  additional  costs  even  though  an  increase  in  as-spent  costs  would
normally  be  expected.  Michael  Mudd,  the  Alliance’s  Chief  Executive  Officer,  ex-
pressed his concern about DOE’s delay in signing the cooperative agreement, saying
it would cause schedule and engineering delays and a loss of credibility. ‘‘We do not
understand  why  issues,  such  as  the  cost-share  fraction,  continue  to  be  revisited.
This specific issue was settled nearly two years ago during discussions between the
White House, OMB, DOE, and the Alliance.’’ The Alliance would like to report ‘‘posi-

jecting the total cost of the project. DOE, ‘‘FutureGen: Integrated Hydrogen, Electric Power Pro-
duction and Carbon Sequestration Research Initiative, supra, p. 9, Figure 3.

tive  progress’’  on  all  fronts  to  Congress  ‘‘rather  than  concerns  that  the  Administra-
tion is having second thoughts about supporting the FutureGen project.’’ 47

In  a  discussion  over  a  draft  press  release  announcing  the  agreement,  Victor  Der,
then-Director  of  DOE’s  Office  of  Clean  Coal  Systems,48 complained  to  George
Rudins, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for coal and power systems, that the re-
lease emphasized a cost increase, not the fact that ‘‘notwithstanding rising inflation
in the heavy construction sector, both the Alliance and DOE believe that FutureGen
is  vitally  important  to  coal  and  climate  change,  and  have  committed  to  continuing
as cost shared partners in this initiative.’’ 49 FE also reminded the Department that
it was a ‘‘key Presidential Initiative and a major Government/Industry Partnership’’
for producing electricity and hydrogen from coal while eliminating emissions and se-
questering carbon dioxide at a low cost.50 The final press release did, however, refer
specifically to the cost increases, but said a review of ‘‘progress and expenses’’ would
not  be  concluded  until  the  end  of  the  first  phase  of  the  project  in  June  of  2008.51
The  Alliance  was  so  upset  by  DOE’s  concerns  as  expressed  in  a  call  from  Deputy
Secretary  Clay  Sell  on  the  day  the  press  release  was  issued  that  Mudd  said  it  was
‘‘putting  the  project  on  hold  until  we  have  the  chance  to  meet  with  Clay  and  Sec-
retary  Bodman  to  address  issues  and  concerns  raised  by  Clay  during  his  call.’’ 52
When  asked  later  in  a  press  call  why  DOE  signed  the  agreement  if  it  already  had
these concerns, Sell said it was the signing of the agreement that brought the finan-
cial issues to his and Secretary Bodman’s attention.53

Sell  and  Bodman  did  not  waste  any  time  bringing  their  hesitation  to  the  White
House.  In  April,  Sell  briefed  staff  of  the  National  Economic  Council,  OMB,  the  Na-
tional  Security  Council  and  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President  on  their  cost  concerns,
and it was agreed that the costs had to be capped.54 Thomas Shope, DOE’s principal
Deputy Assistant Secretary for fossil energy, communicated to the Alliance that ‘‘the
project will not move forward as currently structured.’’ Within days, DOE’s lawyers
were  asked  to  determine  if  the  agreement  made  clear  that  DOE  could  ‘‘just  decide
not to fund it if it got too expensive’’ or how to cap its contribution.55

At  a  May  11,  2007,  meeting  with  NEC  and  OMB  staff,  Shope  recorded  the  fol-

lowing:

DECISIONS:  The  significance  of  the  project  in  the  Administration’s  global  cli-
mate  change  strategy  was  recognized.  However,  additional  cost  containment
measures must be part of the project going forward and must be negotiated be-
fore  the  commencement  of  BP–2.  The  principal  cost  containment  measure  em-
ployed will be a cap on DOE’s expenditures.56

The  $1.8  billion  as-spent  figure  had  been  obtained  by  adding  a  straight-line  5.2
percent  annual  escalation  factor  during  the  construction  of  the  contract  to  the  FY
2004  estimate  of  $950  million,  a  normal  process  for  all  large  projects  built  over  a
number  of  years.  The  Alliance  then  subtracted  $301  million  in  estimated  income
from  the  sale  of  electricity  to  come  up  with  a  net  cost  of  $1.46  billion.  FE  staff  ac-
cepted  that  as  a  reasonable  escalation,  but  construction  costs  in  early  2007  were
growing  at  a  much  higher  rate  because  of  worldwide  demand  for  construction  serv-
ices and materials.57

In an April presentation on the project’s status to DOE, Mudd and his team point-
edly  noted  that  they  ‘‘trusted’’  that  DOE  still  shared  the  vision  the  administration
had  put  forward  ‘‘and  planned  to  provide  the  political,  technical  and  financial  sup-
port  required.’’  He  reminded  DOE  that  the  FutureGen  Alliance  was  formed  in  ‘‘di-
rect response’’ to President Bush’s initiative, and that the industry was contributing
nearly  $400  million  with  ‘‘no  expectation  of  financial  return,’’  but  believed  that
FutureGen  was  central  to  reducing  the  cost  of  addressing  climate  change  by  ‘‘tril-
lions  of  dollars.’’  FutureGen  was  unique  as  no  other  fully  integrated  power  plant
combined  gasification  and  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  in  a  deep  geologic  for-
mation.  It  provided  ‘‘a  clear  mechanism  to  assess  the  cost,  performance,  and  public
acceptance of integrated near-zero emissions power plant, which is an essential pre-
cursor  to  commercial  deployment.’’  Mudd  also  pointed  to  the  global  significance  of
such a project as a catalyst for new projects in other countries and its ability to posi-
tion the U.S. as a leader on climate change solutions.58

Mudd reminded DOE that the Alliance members ‘‘came to the table’’ with certain
understandings: the government would pay 74 percent of the cost; it would maintain
its  support  of  FutureGen;  and  that  the  $950  million  cost  was  in  FY  2004  dollars
and  subject  to  adjustment  for  inflation  which  would  be  shared.  For  their  contribu-
tion, Alliance members would get no financial return or intellectual property rights.
At that time, every milestone had been met. Construction would begin in 2009, but
Mudd  pointed  out  that  heavy  construction  costs  were  up  by  30  percent  and  well
drilling  costs  by  250  percent.59 Work  continued  through  the  summer  on  the  design
and the environmental impact statement, and DOE continued to solicit foreign part-
ners.60

These exchanges marked the beginning of a dual track on FutureGen. The admin-
istration  continued  to  unequivocally  support  FutureGen  in  public.  For  example,  at
the  end  of  the  April  2007  U.S.—EU  summit  on  energy  security,  efficiency  and  cli-
mate  change,  the  White  House  issued  a  joint  statement  pledging  its  support  for
FutureGen without reservation. ‘‘The United States, in partnership with its govern-
ment steering group member countries and the private sector, will build FutureGen,
the United States’ first near-zero emissions fossil fuel plant, by 2012,’’ the statement
read. The first priority was deploying ‘‘near zero emissions coal technologies’’ which
were critical in tackling global CO2 emissions because of coal’s importance in meet-
ing energy needs.61 FE pushed the general counsel’s office to ‘‘move out on the EIS
[Environmental  Impact  Statement]’’  so  that  final  site  selection  could  be  completed
by  the  end  of  2007  because  the  states  had  purchase  options  on  sites  that  expired
at the end of the year.62

But  inside  the  DOE  leadership,  it  was  a  different  story.  In  addition  to  meeting
with  White  House  staff,  Deputy  Secretary  Sell  was  beginning  to  discuss  the  ‘‘path
forward’’ with senior DOE officials, specifically on how to deal with the project’s cost
escalation.  At  the  same  time,  the  agency  was  preparing  its  FY  2009  budget.  Funds
for  FutureGen—which  did  not  have  a  specific  line  item  in  the  budget—had  to  com-
pete annually with other coal research projects such as the Clean Coal Power Initia-
tive (CCPI) and regional carbon sequestration partnerships.

The  Alliance  did  not  want  to  negotiate  a  new  cost  agreement  until  it  had  com-
pleted  more  reliable  cost  estimates  at  the  end  of  the  first  phase  of  the  project  in
June  2008—as  anticipated  in  the  cooperative  agreement—when  it  would  have  a
more  definitive  design.63 It  responded  to  the  pressure  from  DOE  by  appealing  di-
rectly  to  President  Bush  in  a  letter  on  June  18,  2007.  Describing  FutureGen  as  a
‘‘premiere global project’’ with international partners, Mudd wrote that the Alliance
members.

have  dedicated  to  FutureGen  staff  with  global  expertise  in  major  design  and
construction  projects,  and  the  venture  is  operated  with  the  clear  objectives  and
management  discipline  of  any  major  commercials  endeavor.  Costs  are  up  for
every major energy infrastructure project, but the FutureGen Alliance is watch-
ing costs closely as we share in the cost increases.

Mudd  reminded  the  President  that  ‘‘To  date,  your  Administration  has  supported
this  important  global  effort’’  and  referred  to  Bush’s  May  31,  2007,  call  for  ‘‘expand-
ing  global  cooperation  on  research  and  development  to  bring  to  market  technology
based  solutions  to  climate  change  concerns.’’  Continued  government  support  of
FutureGen  was  critical  as  staff  had  to  be  hired,  land  agreements  made  and  major
plant components with long manufacturing lead times needed to be ordered.64

DOE management was not deterred. By July of 2007, Shope had sent a memo to
Secretary Bodman asking for the Secretary’s approval of an immediate renegotiation
of the final cost structure instead of waiting until June 2008.65 The Alliance’s initial
response was that the cost increases were not the fault of anything the Alliance had
done  or  failed  to  do,  and  reiterated  the  commitments  the  members  had  made
through  a  non-profit  consortium.  According  to  the  Alliance,  there  were  already  ru-
mors from the foreign Alliance members that the U.S. might not be that committed
to  FutureGen.  Nonetheless,  Secretary  Bodman  approved  Shope’s  proposal  on  July
27 without addressing the commitment issue.66

In  an  accompanying  memo  to  Sell  listing  various  options,  however,  Shope  said
that  FutureGen  was  configured  to  ‘‘precisely’’  achieve  the  cost  and  performance
goals for the zero emissions coal program and to gain industry acceptance and com-
mercial  deployment  of  the  technology  on  a  domestic  and  global  scale.  It  also  had
strong international support as the ‘‘premier international, collaborative project’’ ad-
dressing  greenhouse  gases  and  climate  change.  Shope  noted  that  the  Alliance  had
been  generally  willing  to  work  with  the  Department  on  cost  overruns  attributable
to design errors, mismanagement, delays from accidents, etc. But the increases pro-
jected  did  not  fall  into  any  of  those  categories,  and  Shope  was  very  skeptical  that
the industry would take on additional risk because there was no direct or immediate
return on its investment, and it was risk-averse.67

Despite the recognition by DOE of these significant factors pointing to FutureGen
as the only way to obtain the cooperation of the coal and power industry , DOE had
already  determined  that  it  was  not  ‘‘financially  sustainable.’’  In  an  August  memo-
randum  to  Bud  Albright,  DOE’s  undersecretary,  Shope  also  said  that  the  Adminis-
tration  was  expressing  concerns  about  the  cost,  although  no  documents  have  been
provided  to  the  Committee  to  verify  that  statement.  However,  it  was  clear  that  the
Secretary’s single goal was to limit the Federal Government’s cost.68

DOE’s  plan  to  renegotiate  was  discussed  with  the  Alliance  staff,  who  told  Sell
they would work to resolve the issue before the final site selection at the end of the
year,  but  whose  nervousness  about  DOE’s  commitment  to  the  project  was  evident.
‘‘The talk on the street that the project is in trouble is affecting [the Alliance’s] abil-
ity to secure good vendors and competitive bids . . .. The Alliance has been told that
some  vendors  are  not  interested  in  chasing  after  the  FutureGen  project  if  it  just
going  to  fall  apart  [sic].’’ 69 But  in  late  August  DOE  told  the  Alliance  board  that  a
negotiation team needed to be formed.70 According to talking points prepared for the
meeting,  Shope  told  the  Alliance  that 
is
unsustainable and sets an unrealistic expectation which needs to be addressed. Sim-
ply put, we cannot commit to funding the project regardless of cost.’’ For the Depart-
ment  to  continue  in  the  partnership,  ‘‘the  FutureGen  financial  plan  must  properly
incentivize  all  parties  to  control  costs  and  to  account  for  those  costs  that  are  not
directly controllable.’’ 71

‘open  checkbook’  approach 

It  was  a  strange  message  to  the  partners  that  DOE  had  solicited  to  join  in  its
risky project—and which everyone at DOE knew did not have much of an incentive
to  join.  DOE  was  now  threatening  to  pull  out  of  its  own  project  and  appeared  to
be  shifting  the  burden  of  the  project  momentum  to  the  Alliance.  It  was  now  up  to
the Alliance to keep FutureGen alive.

In  early  September,  staff  at  DOE’s  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory
(NETL)—the  managers  of  the  FutureGen  project—were  told  that  ‘‘SE–1  [Secretary
Samuel  Bodman]  and  SE–2  [Deputy  Secretary  Sell]  are  directing  DOE  to  ‘renego-
tiate’ the FG award, based upon their assessment that it is a ‘bad deal.’’’ NETL was

to  identify  areas  for  cost  reduction.72 In  a  preliminary  meeting  that  Sell  had  with
the  Alliance,  he  was  told  that  the  Alliance  was  ‘‘potentially  interested’’  in  reducing
its scope so that option was now on the table.73 NETL quickly responded. ‘‘Anything
but  minor  scope  changes  now  could  really  screw  things  up.’’  It  could  mean  another
site  ‘‘best  and  final  offer’’  process,  a  supplemental  draft  environment  impact  state-
ment  and  perhaps  the  loss  of  some  foreign  contributors.  NETL’s  counsel  added,  ‘‘I
would  be  willing  to  bet  the  Alliance  wants  to  reduce  the  CO2 capture  level  and
eliminate  the  co-sequestration  test.  The  latter  might  not  be  such  a  big  deal.  The
former could open a pandora’s box.’’ 74

Sell also wrote to CEQ Chairman Connaughton, Barry Jackson, who had replaced
Karl  Rove,  and  Keith  Hennessey,  President  Bush’s  chief  economic  adviser,  at  the
White House, and Stephen McMillin, the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB)
Deputy  Director  in  charge  of  the  federal  budget,  telling  them  that  FutureGen  was
heading  in  a  ‘‘bad  direction.’’  It  was  experiencing  significant  cost  increases,  and
DOE  might  be  forced  to  cancel.  Sell  said  that  neither  the  Secretary  nor  the  OMB
had  contemplated  these  expenditures  and  expressed  his  belief  that  FutureGen  was
becoming  a  bad  deal  for  the  government  and  politically  unsustainable  in  Congress.
Sell said other priorities in coal research were being threatened by FutureGen.75

Connaughton, who was the Administration’s representative at international meet-
ings  on  climate  change,  asked  that  a  ‘‘tiger  team’’  be  put  together  on  the  problem.
Pointing out that FutureGen was an important part of the administration’s climate
change  response,  Connaughton  emphasized,  ‘‘This  project  is  very  important  . . ..  If
there is a rational option, it should be considered.’’ 76 There is no indication that this
was done.

Options: Strip Down the Project or Change the Cost Share

As  requested,  FE  had  put  together  the  pros  and  cons  for  various  options.  It  did
not favor any major change in the project scope because that would change the basic
goals  of  the  project,  reduce  international  involvement  and  delay  clean  coal  tech-
nology development. Specifically, it found scaling down the plant size from 275 MW
to 120 MW, a 60 percent reduction which would reduce the cost by only 33 percent,
would  not  meet  industry’s  needs.  It  would  be  inefficient,  delay  the  NEPA  process,
not meet the goal of sequestering one million tons of CO2, and still require a subse-
quent  demonstration  in  a  larger  plant.  FutureGen’s  goals  would  be  delayed  by  five
years, and the total cost of the program would increase.77

‘integration’  drum  pretty  hard  in  our 

Later in the negotiations, a NETL staffer worried: ‘‘It occurred to me that we are
beating  the  process 
justification  for
FutureGen, but I don’t think Jim Slutz and most of DOE top management (or any-
one  at  OMB)  have  an  intuitive  feel  for  what  these  integration  issues  are  and  why
dealing with them at large scale is so important . . .. The goal is to drive home the
point  that  these  integration  issues  are  real  and  challenging,  and  are  not  going  to
be  solved  at  smaller-scale.’’ 78 Adding  CCS  to  the  back  end  of  the  system  and  mak-
ing  certain  that  all  the  pieces  work  in  tandem  would  be  a  significant  challenge.79
Another option was to break the project into three separate projects for 1) seques-
tration, 2) the turbine, and 3) the gasifier. FE described its previous negative experi-
ence  with  such  a  system  and  said  it  would  be  difficult  to  find  companies  to  do  the
individual  pieces  because  there  was  no  economic  reason  to  do  so.  For  example,  no
one would take over the sequestration piece because there was no revenue resulting
from sequestering, burying and monitoring CO2.80

Reducing  the  research  and  development  components  of  FutureGen,  which  had
been sold as a ‘‘living laboratory’’ to test out new technologies was also rejected. The
research  was  needed  to  prove  that  there  would  be  no  more  than  a  10  percent  in-
crease  in  the  cost  of  electricity  by  adding  CCS.  Without  testing  in  FutureGen,  ‘‘ad-
vanced  R&D  components  would  first  need  to  be  proven  independently  and  then
proven in an integrated fashion at a commercially relevant scale’’ which ‘‘would sig-
nificantly  delay  the  availability  of  the  technology  for  commercial  deployment  and
would increase overall cost to the program.’’ 81

FE also rejected reducing the carbon capture system efficiency from 90 to 50 per-
cent, reducing fuel flexibility or removing the coal-to-hydrogen component. The only
viable option for a successful FutureGen was to renegotiate the cost share and have
a  firm  DOE  cap  as  Secretary  Bodman  had  made  it  clear  that  he  would  not  sign  on
to a $3–$4 billion deal.82

In  September  of  2007,  FE  made  its  presentation  to  DOE  Deputy  Secretary  Sell.
Citing  once  again  the  benefits  of  FutureGen  in  proving  advances  in  power  genera-
tion  in  an  integrated  fashion  with  a  variety  of  coal  types,  furthering  international
cooperation  with  coal  giants  China  and  India  and  proving  the  viability  of  wide-
spread CCS, FE recommended that the project scope remain the same, but that fur-
ther cost increases be shared 50/50 with the Alliance and title to the plant be given
to  the  Alliance  to  be  used  for  loan  collateral.83 DOE  Under  Secretary  Albright,  the
agency’s lead on the negotiating team, apparently agreed with FE’s analysis.84

President Bush seemed unaware of the concerns of DOE management. He contin-
ued to tout the original program. On September 4, 2007, he issued a joint statement
with  then-prime  minister  John  Howard  of  Australia  welcoming  Australia  to  the
FutureGen International Partnership, which President Bush described as

a  major  United  States-led  international  project  aimed  at  building  a  prototype
plant  that  integrates  coal  gasification  and  carbon  capture  and  storage  to
produce  electricity  with  near-zero  emissions.  This  demonstrates  and  under-
scores the commitment of both countries to the development and deployment of
clean coal technologies.85

Negotiations

The initial negotiation session was held in the first week of October. In that meet-
ing,  the  Alliance  agreed  to  a  50/50  cost  split  after  the  first  $1.8  billion,  but  said  it
had  ‘‘cost  flow  constraints.’’  It  was  considering  financing  options  to  help  ‘‘smooth’’
the costs to its members during the construction phase. The Alliance proposed that
it  receive  100  percent  of  the  program  income,  and  that  DOE  vest  title  to  the  plant
in  the  Alliance  at  the  beginning  of  the  project,  instead  of  the  end.  DOE  found  this
unacceptable, but said internally that the next round of negotiations would focus on
‘‘ways  to  adjust  revenue  and  cost  share  with  the  hope  of  finding  a  ‘win-win’  posi-
tion.’’ 86

The financing issue continued, however, to be the critical sticking point. The Alli-
ance  wanted  to  fund  the  project  through  a  leveraging  plan;  DOE  refused.87 By  the

coal-fired  plant  with  zero  emissions.  ‘‘And  when  that  technology  comes  to  fruition,  if  you  can
get yourself some coal, you’ve got your ability to diversify away from sole-source supplier of en-
ergy.’’  Remarks  by  President  Bush  in  Roundtable  Interview  with  Foreign  Media,  http://

tain. Prospective contributors weren’t sure what they were getting for their $10 million. Because
of proprietary concerns, visiting researchers would not be able to fully view certain project areas.

end  of  October,  DOE  proposed  that  the  individual  Alliance  members  each  give  a
guarantee ‘‘for a significant portion of the financing. If the Alliance defaults or with-
draws,  the  members  must  pay  over  the  guaranteed  amount  to  the  lender  to  reduce
the outstanding debt thereby making it more economically practical for DOE to take
over and complete the project.’’ 88

By early November, DOE told the White House that it had begun work on a ‘‘par-
allel strategy’’ if no agreement could be reached. It would seek to maintain the goals
and  objectives  of  FutureGen  by  ‘‘(a)  adopting  a  different  partnership  construct  that
makes  more  sense  for  the  Federal  Government,  or  (b)  separating  the  project’s  core
technologies  and  accelerating  our  ongoing  R&D  efforts  in  these  areas,  testing  at
smaller  scale  with  limited  integration,  and  expediting  deployment  to  the  market-
place.’’ 89 It was the beginning of what would be known as Plan B, an idea first men-
tioned  by  Bradley  Poston  in  DOE’s  Office  of  Contract  Management.  Poston  had
asked if costs could be reduced by using an existing power plant to test out the car-
bon capture and sequestration products still in the research and development stage.
Poston concluded that without carbon sequestration, there was no reason to proceed
‘‘so  either  the  costs  are  reduced  significantly  or  we  revise  our  goals  and  focus  on
getting  most  of  the  technologies  developed  now  so  that  in  the  future  we  can  design
and build with greater knowledge and confidence in our success and cost control.’’ 90

Plan B

Top DOE officials soon proposed a new FutureGen structure under which private
companies would fund the IGCC plant, and DOE would pay only for the CCS compo-
nent.  In  an  e-mail  exchange  with  a  White  House  staffer,  Albright  described
FutureGen’s  current  structure  as  not  only  fostering  cost  overruns  but  actually
threatening the ‘‘success of the underlying goals of FutureGen.’’ 91 DOE’s clean coal
research  team  did  not  agree.  According  to  FE,  the  national  and  global  costs  of  not
going forward with the original plan would be enormous. Private industry would not
take  on  this  challenge  without  significant  incentives  and  the  passage  of  carbon  re-
duction legislation that gave a value to carbon. ‘‘Given the above delays, and assum-
ing a reluctance to pursue high-cost alternative pathways, it is reasonable to assume
that  without  FutureGen,  the  availability  of  moderate-cost,  coal  fueled  CCS  plants
would be delayed by 10–15 years.’’ (Emphasis in the original)92

The  10-year  delay  would  result  in  a  loss  of  U.S.  emission  reductions  of  about  22
billion  tons  of  CO2;  a  15-year  delay  would  result  in  a  loss  of  33  billion  tons.  For
the  rest  of  the  world,  however,  the  loss  of  this  technological  research  would  be  six
times  the  U.S.  losses,  or  about  150  billion  tons.  Having  a  stream  of  commercially
available,  increasingly  cost-effective  coal/CCS  technology  options  beginning  in  2020
would  also  reduce  electricity  and  natural  gas  costs.  ‘‘Integration  of  concepts  and
components in a full scale test facility like FutureGen is the key to proving the tech-
nical  and  operational  viability  as  well  as  gaining  acceptance  of  the  near-zero  emis-
sion  coal  concept,’’  staff  wrote.93 In  undated  notes  of  an  internal  discussion,  Karen
Harbert,  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  policy  and  international  affairs,  also  reminded
the  group  that  DOE  had  gotten  a  ‘‘plus  up’’  in  the  FE  budget  by  claiming  that  it
would  significantly  accelerate  CCS  development  by  2030,  and  that  there  would  be
a ‘‘big problem’’ if there was a delay.94

These  warnings  were  pushed  aside  as  Albright,  Sell  and  the  DOE  policy  staff
moved forward with Plan B. This structure would scrap the cooperative agreement,
the  Alliance  and  the  international  partners  for  a  new  competitive  procurement
under which individual U.S. companies would take on the responsibility of building
IGCC  plants,  and  DOE  would  pay  only  the  additional  cost  of  the  CCS  component.
At  the  same  time,  however,  DOE  continued  to  negotiate  with  the  Alliance  on  the
cost  share  and  financial  component  and  continued  working  on  the  EIS  for  the  four

sites  which  were  the  finalists.95 FE  raised  again  the  problems  with  IGCC  plants.
Only two had been built, and both ran on natural gas, not synthetic gas or hydrogen
from  coal.  ‘‘Some  of  us  tekkies  worry  that  hydrogen  will  pose  an  even  greater  chal-
lenge  than  syngas  did.  Add-in  a  water-gas  shift  reactor,  which  no  IGCC  plant  now
has. Then tack CCS onto the back end and make certain that all of the pieces work
in tandem. You get the drift,’’ a NETL engineer wrote.96

Other  people  started  to  raise  questions,  and  the  scramble  was  on  to  justify  Plan
B.  A  debate  between  Doug  Schwartz,  Albright’s  Chief  of  Staff,  and  Poston  revealed
the  difficulties  of  making  the  new  plan  viable—even  on  paper.  Poston  said  a  new
competition  would  delay  the  schedule,  and  he  could  see  no  industry  self-interest.
‘‘We  may  give  a  party  no  one  comes  to,’’  he  wrote.  Schwartz  answered  that  DOE
would just have to create more self-interest.

[T]here may be a new model(s) we come up—in theory—that may alter our prior
determination there is no return on investment for partners, whether resulting
from changing the IP approach, permitting vendors to participate, an impending
prospect of carbon regulation that did not exist so acutely in 2003, or other vari-
ables. In other words, there may be compelling reasons beyond corporate philan-
thropy  for  outside  parties  that  would  encourage  their  interest.  Perhaps  that  is
hopelessly  naive  on  my  part,  but  this  is  what  we  must  fully  explore  and  hope-
fully unlock.

Poston responded that he hadn’t seen those compelling reasons. Although the po-
tential  return  on  investment  was  great  in  social  terms,  it  was  ‘‘non-existent  in  eco-
nomic  terms.’’  Schwartz  agreed  with  that  conclusion,  but  argued  that  to  come  up
with a viable Plan B, they needed to

fundamentally  alter  our  assumptions  as  we  strive  to  come  up  with  a  new  ap-
proach.  So  if  we  start  the  process  with  the  goal  of  creating  more  self  interest
from  the  private  sector  (by  granting  more  IP  exclusivity,  allowing  vendors  to
compete,  etc.),  would  that  not  change  our  thinking  on  how  we  might  structure
things? In other words, do veheicles [sic] like TIAs, loan guarantees, etc. become
more viable tools if, at the outset, we seek to avoid a construct which is as ‘‘phil-
anthropically’’ focused as the current deal seems to be?

Poston responded, ‘‘I am not certain how we can fundamentally alter the econom-

ics.’’ He continued:

The economics of our power production require other sources of revenue to offset
the additional costs associated with carbon sequestration . . .. I have not heard
of  other  revenue  streams  being  identified  except  looking  for  participation  from
philanthropic  organizations  . . .  but  how  would  that  play  in  the  press?  ‘‘DOE
unable to support its own priorities; competes with the needy for funding?’’

Schwartz admitted that ‘‘absent a basic change in some of the underlying assump-
tions,  this  is  a  circular  exercise  in  which  we  will  always  arrive  at  the  rightful  con-
clusion that the current arrangement is the best mechanism for achieving our goals’’
(emphasis added).97

While  this  discussion  was  going  on,  Poston  also  wrote  of  his  strong  misgivings  to

Thomas Brown, the Director of the Office of Contract Management.

Yesterday’s  meeting  on  what  to  do  if  an  agreement  on  a  revised  Cooperative
Agreement could not be reached included new participants but not new insights
or conclusions.
A  very  optimistic  perspective  was  being  offered  on  the  possibilities  of  what  we
could do differently. I did try an [sic] add . . . an element of reality in that we

took our best approach with the initial award and that unless we have changed

Operating on Dual Tracks

By  the  end  of  November,  Sell  was  making  daily  requests  for  a  detailed  Plan  B
draft.100 There  is  no  indication  that  this  option  was  ever  shared  with  the  Alliance
until DOE made the announcement on December 18 that it was going to restructure
FutureGen.

DOE’s work on the Environmental Impact Statement required under the National
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  for  the  four  finalist  FutureGen  sites  was  going
forward as scheduled. DOE’s October fact sheet on FutureGen mentioned that there
were cost increases, but that they were ‘‘consistent with the increases seen in simi-
lar  power  plant  projects  and  construction  projects.’’ 101 On  October  30,  a  DOE  em-
ployee  said  DOE  was  ‘‘diligently  working’’  to  complete  the  NEPA  process  and  issue
a Record of Decision (ROD) by the end of 2007.102 The final EIS was issued on No-
vember  9.103 On  November  15,  Albright  and  Slutz  recommended  that  Secretary
Bodman sign a letter to the Illinois Congressional delegation responding to an Octo-
ber  25  letter  expressing  concern  about  meeting  the  year-end  deadline  for  a  site  se-
lection.  In  that  letter—which  he  later  said  was  a  mistake—Secretary  Bodman  re-
peated the commitment to complete the NEPA process and issue the ROD in a time-
frame that supported FutureGen site selection by the end of December. Albright and
Slutz  also  reminded  the  Secretary  that  the  Texas  legislature  had  passed  incentives
for  a  site  in  its  state  which  would  expire  at  the  end  of  the  year.104 In  late  Novem-
ber, NETL staff was discussing a ‘‘big event’’ with DOE participation when the Alli-
ance announced its final site selection.105 By mid-December, sign-offs were being ob-
tained  on  the  ROD.  The  ‘‘potential’’  ROD  signing  was  set  for  December  17  or  18,
and a letter was drafted to the Alliance to that effect for Secretary Bodman.106

At  the  same  time,  the  Alliance  also  was  pushing  forward.  In  early  December,  it
issued  Secretary  Bodman  an  invitation  to  the  site  selection  announcement  on  De-
cember 17.

But the negotiations were not going well. On December 6, the Alliance sent a let-
ter  to  Albright  stating  that  it  wanted  to  proceed  under  the  existing  cooperative
agreement  until  ‘‘costs  and  risks  can  be  properly  assessed  with  input  from  the  up-
coming preliminary design report and cost estimate.’’ The Alliance members did not
want  to  accept  considerably  more  financial  risk  without  this  information  which
‘‘both parties previously agreed would be a precursor to these discussions.’’ The Alli-
ance  also  accused  DOE  of  taking  away  the  legal  and  financial  options  that  would
help  it  manage  risk  even  though  they  had  been  available  under  other  cooperative
agreements,  but  assured  DOE  that  its  members  would  honor  their  obligations.  The

Alliance  said  both  parties  should  ‘‘convey  positive  messages  about  the  project’’  and
not  suggest  that  the  current  agreement  was  ‘‘anything  less  than  a  ‘good  deal.’ ’’  As-
suming  release  by  DOE  of  the  ROD  by  December  17,  the  Alliance  would  make  the
site announcement on December 18.107

In  a  detailed  attachment,  Alliance  CEO  Mudd  laid  out  the  basis  upon  which  the

Alliance was originally formed:
1. 20 percent cost-sharing;
2. no repayment requirement from industry partner;
3. ability to vest ownership of plant with industry partners;
4. potential for program income to be shared among project participants;
5. 100 percent of post-project revenues to industry partners; and
6. advanced appropriation of $300 million by DOE.

But  the  Alliance  members  had  given  up  many  benefits  by  forming  as  a  501(3)(c)
non-profit corporation, which meant that no income or proceeds could go back to the
original  members,  but  must  be  reinvested  in  public  benefit  research  and  develop-
ment.  They  got  no  intellectual  property  rights.  The  cost  share  increased  to  26  per-
cent.  There  was  an  agreement  to  negotiate  limits  to  the  federal  investment  subject
to  escalation  after  there  was  a  more  detailed  site-specific  design  and  cost  estimate.
Mudd also pointed to the offers made by the Alliance to share revenues and to share
proceeds from the sale with DOE.108

Slutz  responded  in  a  short  letter  stating  that  DOE  was  evaluating  its  ‘‘next  ac-
tions’’  with  respect  to  the  Alliance  and  the  FutureGen  project.  He  further  said  that
the Alliance had scheduled its final site selection announcement without consulting
with  DOE—although  DOE  had  been  aware  for  months  of  the  plan  to  make  the  an-
nouncement  by  the  end  of  the  year—and  that  DOE  would  consider  it  ‘‘inadvisable’’
for the Alliance to do so because DOE did not anticipate issuing the ROD.109

‘‘Sanity Check’’

In  early  December,  Brad  Poston  was  asked  for  a  last  ‘‘sanity  check’’  on  Plan  B.
In  a  meeting  with  Andrew  Patterson,  a  senior  policy  adviser,  Poston  said  that  the
most  critical  question  was  whether  industry  would  want  to  participate  and  re-
minded  Patterson  that  four  years  ago,  industry  had  shown  little  interest  in
FutureGen. ‘‘[W]e would be asking a utility stereotyped as risk averse [sic] organiza-
tion, to use our unproven design on their $2.5B investment.’’ 110

DOE  top  officials  weren’t  having  any  of  it.  On  December  7,  Albright  told  Jeff
Kupfer,  Secretary  Bodman’s  Chief  of  Staff,  that  further  negotiations  with  the  Alli-
ance were ‘‘at best fruitless and likely counter-productive.’’ Albright had a new over-
all plan, but needed the approval of Sell, the Secretary and the White House.111

On  December  11,  DOE  briefed  the  National  Economic  Council  deputies  on  the
new  plan.  Secretary  Bodman  briefed  the  NEC  ‘‘principals’’  on  December  14  on
DOE’s intent to restructure.112 The ‘‘new strategy’’ was laid out in a briefing memo-
randum. He would cap the government’s financial exposure and pointed to develop-
ments,  such  as  tax  credits  and  loan  guarantees  for  clean  coal  projects,  that  had  oc-
curred since FutureGen was conceived in 2003. DOE would issue a competitive solic-
itation ‘‘aimed at accelerating near-term commercial deployment of integrated IGCC
commercial  power  plants  with  cutting-edge  CCS  technology.’’  DOE  would  fund  only
the  CCS  component  of  multiple  IGCC  plants,  which  it  estimated  would  cost  $350–
$500  million  per  plant.  DOE’s  unnamed  ‘‘experts’’  believed  there  would  be  ‘‘signifi-
cant’’ private sector interest, although it had not discussed this with the private sec-
tor.113

Good Faith?

Whether DOE was operating in good faith during these negotiations with the Alli-
ance  is  highly  questionable.  Secretary  Bodman’s  intense  dislike  for  the  project  was
well-known  by  his  staff.  Undated  notes  recording  a  meeting  about  the  legal  obliga-
tions of the Department related to FutureGen read as follows: ‘‘S–1 [Bodman] aggra-
vated  by  this  project.  Bob  Card  [former  DOE  Under  Secretary]  deal.  Trying  to  do

everything in one project get smart on alternative options. Can we turn this off/redi-
rect?’’ 114 At the end of September, Albright told FE ‘‘to work under the assumption
that a threshold at the 1.8B figure with a 50/50 split afterwards, with some adjust-
ment  for  increasing  Alliance  membership,  would  be  sufficient.’’ 115 But  on  October
25, an FE employee walked into a meeting with several high-level DOE officials, in-
cluding Albright, Alexander (Andy) Karsner, the Assistant Secretary for energy effi-
ciency and renewable energy, and Karen Harbert, the Assistant Secretary for policy
and international affairs.

The  topic  of  discussion  seemed  to  be  how  best  to  kill  FutureGen.  It  was  great
fun,  with  Karsner  leading  the  charge  by  suggesting  that  we  just  compete
FutureGen  under  the  loan  guarantee  program  and  let  industry  fight  over  who
gets the federal cost share, and touting how they make industry eat all the cost
escalation in their biomass contracts.116

Interestingly, earlier in the year, Albright had been quoted as saying that any ac-
tion on climate change had to involve the rest of the world. ‘‘Unless China and India
are  acting  with  us,  it’s  pointless.  They  emit  more  carbon  dioxide  than  we  do.’’ 117
Even though DOE and the Alliance had accomplished that goal and had both China
and India as FutureGen partners, Albright was now in the lead to dismantle it.

Secretary Bodman appears to have made it clear to DOE staff that he did not care
about  the  overarching  goals  of  FutureGen,  but  only  its  cost.  As  Bradley  Poston
wrote  in  the  midst  of  his  efforts  to  contribute  to  a  new  plan,  ‘‘I  have  an  imperfect
. . . understanding of the program; the current market conditions; and the changes
in  operating  parameters  from  four  years  ago  when  the  original  acquisition  strategy
was developed. I see the true issue to be money and our ability to cap our financial
exposure.’’ 118

Bodman’s  letter  to  Alliance  CEO  Mudd  at  the  end  of  October  stating  that  the
ROD  would  be  completed  in  time  for  a  site  announcement  at  the  end  of  December
appeared  to  be  a  commitment  to  the  original  FutureGen.  But  in  December,  Doug
Schwartz,  Albright’s  Chief  of  Staff,  said  everyone  was  ‘‘conveniently  forgetting’’  one
thing:  ‘‘[W]e’re  here  b/c  S–1  [Bodman]  wants  to  kill  FG  as  its  [sic]  currently  con-
templated, with or without a Plan B.’’ 119 It was also clear that everyone knew that
Plan  B  had  a  very  good  chance  of  failing  to  meet  the  original  goals.  It  would  be
cheaper, but it might not work, and carbon capture would then be delayed. ‘‘We dis-
cussed the additional risk to the company building the plant and if they would actu-
ally  be  willing  to  take  on  this  risk.  I  don’t  think  we  will  know  that  until  we  put
out  a  RFI  and  see  what  industry  says,’’  Sarah  Magruder  Lyle,  DOE’s  White  House
liaison,  wrote.  The  ‘‘message’’  focus  would  be  on  fiscal  responsibility.  There  would
be  no  fully  funded  advance  appropriations  for  Plan  B.  Research  would  continue
under the Clean Coal R&D program as in the past.120

It  is  also  clear  that  the  Alliance  did  not  know  the  details  of  Plan  B  during  the
negotiations,  although  Albright  may  have  discussed  it  generally  with  some  of  the
member companies.121

The Decision

White  House  staff  was  expressing  ‘‘much  angst’’  over  what  Plan  B  would  mean
for commercial deployment of CCS technology.122 DOE officials asked for a clear de-
ployment  timeline  of  ‘‘educated  guesses  and  assumptions.’’  The  response  was  luke-
warm at best even from the policy shop.

Schedule for plan B is commercial scale operation of two or three plants by 2015
with the demo lasting until 2018. One could argue that you would have commer-
cially deployed plants in 2015 and at a minimum you can argue that you would

have  them  at  2018  assuming  that  they  are  still  doing  CCS  after  the  demo
(emphasis added).

On  the  other  hand,  FutureGen  would  operate  from  2012–15.  But  if  one  ‘‘aggres-
sively’’  assumed  it  would  take  three  to  five  years  before  a  commercial  plant  was
built, you could claim the 2018–20 timeframe for the first commercial deployment—
not exactly an acceleration from the original FutureGen.123

Nonetheless, the DOE higher ups had made their decision: Plan B would be rolled
out  with  the  promise  that  it  would  be  better,  faster  and  cheaper  than  the  original
FutureGen,  regardless  of  the  economics,  industry  interest,  and  the  predictions  of
their own staff. Secretary Bodman communicated that to Senator Durbin in a phone
call that apparently occurred on December 13.124 On that same day, the NEC prin-
cipals  met  and  approved  a  restructuring  of  FutureGen  if  the  Alliance  didn’t  agree
with all of DOE’s demands.125

Victor Der, DOE’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for clean coal, was blunt in his op-
position. Plan B was only a demonstration which ‘‘will likely use more conservative,
more costly and substantially less efficient IGCC–CCS technologies rather than the
more aggressive technologies being developed in our R&D program aimed at poten-
tial  cost  and  energy  penalty  reductions  . . ..  Under  Plan  B  we  would  still  have  to
follow  up  with  sequential  CCPI  type  demos  which  would  incrementally  add  one  or
two advanced technologies at a time. This serial approach costs us time to fully de-
ploy CCS globally.’’ Der went on to say that his group’s estimate that Plan B could
delay  by  at  least  10  years  full  commercial  deployment  of  low-cost,  low  energy  ad-
vanced  CCS  technology  that  could  be  transferred  to  developing  countries  wasn’t  in-
cluded  in  the  final  analysis.  A  follow-up  e-mail  stated  that  affordable  CCS  tech-
nologies also would not be available in time for the expected turnover of the existing
fleet of coal power plants in the U.S.126 DOE officials responded by saying they were
continuing to work ‘‘on a scenario that allows us to reduce/eliminate the 10 year de-
ployment delay.’’ 127

Impact of OMB Budget Cuts

Secretary  Bodman  wasn’t  the  only  high-level  government  official  not  on  board
with  the  President’s  initiative.  In  September,  DOE’s  budget  shop  told  FE  that  the
President’s budget had additional funding that enabled FutureGen to stay on track
and  supported  the  baseline  schedule.  It  reflected  the  ramp-up  of  activities  as  the
program moved toward full-scale operation in 2012. FY 2009 activities included the
complete detailed design of a prototype plant, money to initiate construction and the
continued  procurement  of  long-lead  equipment.128 But  in  November,  the  Office  of
Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  which  was  well  aware  of  Bodman’s  opposition,
eliminated all of the climate change funds from FE’s budget.129

In  early  December,  James  Connaughton,  the  Chairmanaman  of  the  President’s
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), met with representatives from Fossil En-
ergy  to  discuss  clean  coal  research  in  preparation  for  his  attendance  at  the  United
Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  in  Bali.  Connaughton—who
may  not  have  been  fully  aware  of  the  unrelenting  drive  toward  Plan  B—said  that
the U.S. had two options: either invest billions of dollars to develop the technologies
to address climate change; or face a new regulatory environment that would not ad-
vance the technology. He also said that the U.S. needed to elicit more parallel activ-
ity in China and India.130

Connaughton’s concerns were to no avail. On December 11, while he was in Bali,
he  received  an  e-mail  from  Karen  Harbert  at  DOE.  ‘‘I  know  how  busy  you  are  in
Bali, but without significant interest by WH offices, we will not have a serious effort
in  climate,’’  she  wrote—and  there  was  no  such  interest.  Harbert  went  on  to  says
that  in  the  FY08  budget  request,  DOE  had  shifted  over  $500  million  toward  high-
priority  programs,  including  Futuregen,  in  clean  coal  and  nuclear  research  and  de-
velopment, but OMB had eliminated all of the additions. Harbert acknowledged that
the  heavy  emphasis  on  CCS  would  also  help  reduce  emissions  in  China  and  India,
but  that  OMB  had  eliminated  ‘‘all  funded  increase  for  clean  coal,  greatly  under-
mining  plans  for  critical  demonstrations  as  well  as  FutureGen.’’ 131 In  a  related  e-
mail, Connaughton was portrayed as being

very  apprehensive  about  the  international  piece—and  how  we  deal.  What  hap-
pens  to  other  countries,  etc.  Bottom  line  is  that  he  likes  his  international  talk-
ing  point  and  wants  to  keep  it.  CEQ  is  going  to  try  to  set  up  a  call  for  you
[Harbert]  and  him  sometime  later  today—so  that  you  can  convince  him  that
this is meangeale [sic]. Hopefully you can do that.132

These budget cuts made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to build the origi-
nal FutureGen under any circumstances, as the DOE expenditures were front-load-
ed in the project schedule, even with a 50/50 cost share after the initial $1.8 billion
was spent.

Announcement by Alliance of Final Site Selection

The  Alliance’s  time  line  established  the  end  of  2007  for  the  announcement  of  the
final site decision. As DOE had completed the final EIS, the Alliance scheduled the
announcement  for  December  18.  The  winner  was  the  State  of  Illinois  with  a  site
near  the  city  of  Mattoon.  But  within  hours,  DOE,  in  a  statement  made  by  James
Slutz,  said  that  ‘‘the  public  interest  mandates  that  FutureGen  deliver  the  greatest
possible  technological  benefits  in  the  most  cost-efficient  manner.  This  will  require
restructuring FutureGen to maximize the role of private sector innovation, facilitate
the  most  productive  public-private  partnership,  and  prevent  further  cost  esca-
lation.’’ 133 DOE also stated that it would not sign the Record of Decision on the EIS
which  was  required  before  any  federal  project  construction  funds  could  be  ex-
pended.134

Plan B Goes Forward

During January, there were some continued negotiations with the Alliance as the
White House had not yet officially signed off on Plan B. On January 10, the Alliance
sent a letter proposing a ‘‘new approach to financing FutureGen.’’ It would increase
its cost share if overall costs went up, make post-project repayments and do partial
bank  construction  financing.  Under  this  approach,  the  Alliance  claimed  the  final
taxpayer  investment  would  be  no  greater  than  it  was  on  the  day  President  Bush
announced the project.135 But DOE internally remained focused on Plan B. Albright
told  DOE  and  White  House  staff  that  ‘‘[r]egardless  of  the  value  of  their  proposal,
we need to continue to move expeditiously with the new direction rollout.’’ The Alli-
ance,  for  its  part,  refused  to  share  the  details  of  its  proposal  unless  there  was  an
‘‘in  person’’  meeting.136 DOE’s  clean  coal  staff  had  one  job  left:  make  the  fantasy
that was Plan B look good on paper.

Putting  together  a  seemingly  logical  story  around  Plan  B  to  sell  to  the  White
House,  Congress,  the  press  and  the  public  was  not  an  easy  job.  After  reviewing  a
rough  outline  of  the  program  plan,  Victor  Der  forwarded  it  to  Jay  Hoffman,  DOE’s
Director  of  program  analysis  and  evaluation  with  this  message:  ‘‘Here’s  the  Frank-
enstein.  I’ll  be  calling  NETL  to  see  where  they  are  in  the  electrodes  development

to make it walk.’’ 137 Hoffman responded with a new ‘‘FutureGen Plan B Storyline.’’
The  main  rationale,  according  to  Hoffman,  was  ‘‘a  more  appropriate  public/private
cost  allocation  between  DOE  and  industry.  Secondary  benefits  may  include  acceler-
ated  commercial  demonstration  and  more  carbon-free  power,  but  these  are  not  driv-
ing  reasons  for  why  Plan  B  is  being  developed’’  (emphasis  added),  Hoffman  wrote.
IGCC  technology  was  ‘‘a  largely  commercially  proven  technology’’  and  didn’t  need
government  assistance.  CCS,  on  the  other  hand,  was  ‘‘largely  unproven,’’  and  DOE
would  pay  for  the  resulting  research  and  development,  operating  and  maintenance
and parasitic energy losses that the private company would incur.138

After  looking  at  the  ‘‘story  line,’’  Der  wasn’t  convinced.  ‘‘[T]he  FrankenGen  docu-
ment,  I  mean,  New  FutureGen,  needs  to  be  taught  to  walk  first,  before  it  can  hop
on a Harley.’’ 139

A  few  days  later,  Secretary  Bodman  was  briefed  by  Albright  on  DOE’s  ‘‘new
focus.’’  The  possible  ‘‘secondary  benefits’’  became  real  benefits  in  this  presentation.
Because of construction costs, ‘‘growing near-term interest in carbon dioxide regula-
tions  and  states  beginning  to  require  CCS  or  the  flexibility  to  add  CCS  for  siting/
permitting  of  coal  plants,’’  DOE  was  now  going  to  focus  on  ‘‘first-of-a  kind  full  util-
ity-scale demonstrations and developing data on commercial cost, integrated IGCC–
CCS performance and reliability to reduce risk, confirm economics and facilitate in-
dustry-wide  private  capital  offerings.’’  This  would  allow  for  early  deployment  of
‘‘nearer-term IGCC–CCS technologies’’ at commercial plants and would also address
the  ‘‘very  critical  technical  feasibility  question’’  of  a  near-zero  emission  coal  plant.
There  would  be  a  minimum  of  two  600  MW  plants,  each  of  which  would  capture
and  store  at  least  one  million  metric  tons  of  CO2 per  year.  Staff  did  note,  however,
that  cost  reductions  and  competitive  technology  were  still  needed  for  full  deploy-
ment,  and  that  those  technologies  would  still  have  to  be  demonstrated  later.  There
was no explanation about why industry would test technology that was not yet cost-
effective.140

The Department also struggled to put together an internal ‘‘strategic plan’’ for the
White  House  that  would  incorporate—with  some  facial  credibility—the  new
FutureGen  structure  while  claiming  to  maintain  the  original  goals  of  an  IGCC,
near-zero  emission  plant.  DOE  postulated  that  because  of  the  challenges  of  getting
coal-fired plants licensed, this ‘‘change in the market landscape’’ had ‘‘catalyzed the
need’’ to demonstrate the commercial viability of an IGCC/CCS plant. However, be-
cause  of  the  uncertainty  about  the  cost  and  performance  of  such  plants,  plans  for
them were being abandoned or postponed. ‘‘Unless the production of electricity from
coal  integrated  with  sequestering  carbon  dioxide  can  be  shown  to  be  commercially
feasible  and  cost  competitive,  the  coal  industry  will  not  make  the  investments  nec-
essary  to  fully  realize  the  potential  energy  security  and  economic  benefits  of  this
plentiful,  domestic  energy.’’ 141 Reducing  that  uncertainty  of  course,  was  exactly
what  the  original  FutureGen  was  supposed  to  demonstrate.  But  in  an  inexplicable
shift  in  reasoning,  DOE  then  said  that  it  would  achieve  its  goals  more  quickly  if
it could attach a CCS technology to a commercially built IGCC plant. It would speed
up  commercialization,  help  drive  the  regulatory  framework  and  address  the  ‘‘very
critical  technical  feasibility  question  of  advanced  technology  clean  coal  plants.’’ 142
FE did not go down without a fight. On January 10, Jay Hoffman, Director of the
Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, who was working on the FY 2009 budg-
et, laid down the law to Victor Der and Jarad Daniels.

Let  me  get  right  to  the  point.  As  written,  the  CFO’s  [Chief  Financial  Officer]
office will not concur on the project plan. It is sorely lacking in detail and anal-
ysis, and provides little defense or answer to the difficult questions we will field
from the WH, the alliance, and ultimately the public/Congress . . .. My expecta-
tion  was  for  your  office  to  develop  a  solid,  analytically  supported  plan  that  at
a minimum included the suggested analysis, with the caveat that you could de-
termine how best to frame the story around that analysis.

Hoffman  said  he  expected  a  revised  project  plan  for  the  decision  makers  that
would  be  ‘‘bullet  proof  and  ready  for  the  WH.’’  It  needed  to  describe  what  went
wrong  with  the  original  FutureGen  and  why  Plan  B  would  be  successful,  including
why industry would buy into it.143

The  goals  listed  in  the  new  FutureGen  in  the  final  drafts  read  like  DOE’s  ulti-
mate  coal  dream:  it  would  validate  CCS  at  multiple  sites,  it  would  inject  and  mon-
itor  CO2 at  multiple  geologic  formations,  integrate  CCS  with  multiple  gasification-
based  power  production  technologies;  develop  a  regulatory  and  permitting  system;
provide  the  possibility  of  international  participation  at  more  than  one  project;
produce a more comprehensive and reliable set of operating data, and promote early
widespread  deployment  of  IGCC–CCS  technology.  In  addition,  it  would  capture  at
least 90 percent of CO2 and mercury, 99 percent of sulfur, and reduce NOΧ and par-
ticulate emissions. And all this came with a lower federal price tag.144

There,  of  course,  was  one  big  problem:  Plan  B  would  cost  the  power  generator  a
great deal of money in capital, operating and maintenance and parasitic energy loss
costs.  DOE’s  program  and  budget  people  struggled  for  a  month  to  put  together  a
cost  estimate  that  would  be  lower  than  the  original  FutureGen.  Initially,  DOE  was
going  to  pay  for  the  parasitic  energy  loss,  but  that  became  too  expensive  so  it  was
deleted.  The  government  would  only  pay  capital  costs  for  the  CCS  addition  to  an
IGCC  plant.  Questions  raised  about  the  readiness  and  costs  of  the  CCS  technology
were ignored. ‘‘Biggest area of concern remain ‘new technology’ and the insertion of
this new technology into a ‘generic’ plant; not sure of the true impact and cost impli-
cations,’’  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Engineering  and  Construction  Management
wrote.145 ‘‘Taking  these  concerns  in  totality,  and  looking  at  it  from  industry’s  per-
spective, how does this uncertainty impact the profit potential of the project? At the
end  of  the  day,  this  will  determine  participation  by  industry,’’  other  DOE  officials
warned.146

There  was  another  concern:  the  White  House  hadn’t  yet  signed  off  on  DOE’s
plan.147 The final White House meeting was on January 25. DOE presented a stra-
tegic  plan,  complete  with  proposed  press  release  and  request  for  information  (RFI),
for  Plan  B  to  go  out  on  January  31.  DOE  would  contact  the  Alliance  and  make  a
final offer: the Alliance had until January 29 to accept the terms, which had a ‘‘50/
50  cost  share  after  the  1.8,  and  stating  that  the  Alliance  contribution  may  not  in-
clude project financed debt.’’ If the Alliance did not accept those terms, DOE would
announce its new approach and put out the RFI on Jan 31.148

The  White  House  meeting  was  to  be  hosted  by  Keith  Hennessey,  NEC’s  Director
and  economic  adviser  to  President  Bush.  Invited  participants  included  OMB  Direc-
tor  Jim  Nussle;  David  Addington,  Vice  President  Cheney’s  counsel;  Press  Secretary
Dana  Perino;  Joel  Kaplan,  White  House  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff;  CEQ  Chairman
Connaughton;  Presidential  Counselor  Ed  Gillespie;  Charles  Blahous,  NEC  Deputy
Director; and Dr. John Marburger, Director of the Office of Science and Technology
Policy.149 Sell and Albright were to ‘‘tell WH details of going forward and get bless-
ing.’’ 150

Albright  and  Sell  told  the  NEC  principals  everything  they  needed  to  hear  to  be-
lieve  that  the  Bush  initiative  would  remain  intact.  The  restructured  FutureGen
would  achieve  all  of  the  primary  technical  goals  of  the  original  project  which  was
‘‘no longer optimal to achieve the goal of accelerating the commercial demonstration

and  deployment  of  advanced,  integrated  coal-based  power  systems  including  CCS.’’
But  the  government’s  financial  exposure  would  be  limited  to  mitigating  the  ‘‘incre-
mental risk of the addition of CCS’’ while its investment would be leveraged ‘‘across
a  wider  range  of  nearer-term  coal  based  IGCC–CCS  projects.’’ 151 Not  only  would  it
accelerate  deployment  of  CCS  technology,  restructured  FutureGen  would  establish
the technical feasibility and economic viability of producing electricity and hydrogen
from  coal  with  near-zero  emissions.  It  would  verify  the  sustained,  integrated  oper-
ation and effectiveness, safety and permanence of a coal conversion system with car-
bon  sequestration,  it  would  establish  standardized  technologies  and  protocols  for
CO2 monitoring, mitigation and verification, it would sequester at least one million
tons  of  CO2 in  saline  formations;  it  would  capture  at  least  90  percent  of  the  CO2
emitted; 90 percent of the mercury emitted; 99 percent of the sulfur and high levels
of  NOΧ and  particulate  emissions.  There  would  be  a  more  rapid  investment  by  in-
dustry  in  multiple  demonstrations  of  ‘‘near-commercially  available  technologies’’  for
CCS.152

Additionally,  because  of  the  loss  of  the  ‘‘living  laboratory’’  element  of  FutureGen,
there  would  be  a  ‘‘fresh  look  at  the  commercialization  profile  of  key  FE  tech-
nologies.’’  This  was  a  particularly  puzzling  statement  because  the  table  of  tech-
nologies  that  followed  made  it  clear  that  most  of  them  were  still  at  the  bench  or
laboratory  stage  of  development,  and  FE  would  have  to  find  alternative  host  sites.
There  were  other  confusing  statements.  While  admitting  that  Plan  B  would  delay
the cost-reduction improvements that were ultimately needed for coal/CCS plants to
be an attractive commercial option in both the U.S. and internationally,153 Sell and
Albright claimed that it would demonstrate ‘‘commercial feasibility.’’ Private compa-
nies apparently were now expected to quantify the technical and economic risk asso-
ciated  with  near-zero  emissions  coal  plants,  thus  ‘‘enabling  private  financing  deci-
sions of future plants of this type’’ and facilitating ‘‘industry-wide private capital of-
ferings.’’ 154

But  deep  in  the  strategic  plan  was  the  recognition  that  incorporating  CCS  on  a
commercial-scale  IGCC  plant  added  capital  and  operating  costs  and  ‘‘is  still  per-
ceived  by  the  electricity  generation  industry  as  an  emerging  technology.  Concerns
remain over the integration and scale-up risks associated with IGCC, and a cost gap
still remains when compared to conventional coal power plants.’’ Industry’s reaction
to  the  new  program  would  depend  on  the  ‘‘magnitude  of  the  government’s  commit-
ment to the project’’ and its ability to ‘‘reasonably satisfy’’ those concerns and allow
the  plants  to  function  competitively.  And,  of  course,  there  was  that  troubling  issue
of liability for the sequestration of CO2.155

DOE  also  claimed  that  its  international  partners  would  favorably  respond,  even
though  they  no  longer  could  share  in  the  technology  development  or  work  at  the
new sites. Inexplicably, DOE found that the new approach would actually ‘‘raise the
efficiency of information sharing.’’ 156

Albright  and  Sell  were  successful.  By  January  28,  everyone  in  the  White  House

was ‘‘on board’’ with the announcement for a restructured FutureGen.157

In  the  final  strategic  plan,  DOE  ignored  every  concern  of  its  own  staff.  ‘‘Today,
more than ever, the concept of FutureGen is a centerpiece for the future of coal utili-
zation,’’ the plan trumpeted.

FutureGen  directly  addresses  a  primary  goal  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s
(DOE) 2006 Strategic Plan under the Theme for Energy Security to promote Amer-
ica’s  energy  security  through  reliable,  clean,  and  affordable  energy:  Environmental
Impact of Energy: ‘‘Improve the quality of the environment by reducing greenhouse
gas  emissions  and  environmental  impacts  to  land,  water  and  air  from  energy  pro-
duction and use.’’158

January 30, 2008 announcement

149

Secretary  Bodman  met  with  the  Illinois  delegation  on  January  29  to  forewarn
them  of  the  announcement.  His  plan  was  very  poorly  received  by  both  Republicans
and Democrats, who called it ‘‘unfair,’’ ‘‘cruel’’ and ‘‘incompetent management.’’ They
asked how DOE could throw away Illinois’ five years of work.159 Just before the an-
nouncement,  Illinois  Republican  Congressmen  Tim  Johnson  and  John  Shimkus
made  an  appeal  directly  to  President  Bush  to  save  the  project.  The  President  said
he stood by Bodman’s decision.160

DOE  then  announced  that  it  would  ‘‘join  industry’’  in  its  efforts  to  build  IGCC
plants  by  providing  funding  for  the  addition  of  CCS  technology  to  multiple  plants
that would be operational by 2015. According to DOE, this would double the amount
of  CO2 sequestered  compared  to  the  original  FutureGen.161 The  restructured  ap-
proach  allowed  DOE  to  ‘‘maximize  the  role  of  private  sector  innovation,  provide  a
ceiling on federal contributions, and accelerate the Administration’s goal of increas-
ing  the  use  of  clean  energy  technology  to  help  meet  the  steadily  growing  demand
for  energy  while  also  mitigating  greenhouse  gas  emissions.’’ 162 Secretary  Bodman
also  claimed  that  engagement  with  the  international  community  would  remain  ‘‘an
integral part’’ of DOE’s efforts, although he had already been told that private com-
panies would not be interested in freely sharing their technology with other parties,
foreign or domestic.163

The  mysterious  ‘‘technology  advance’’  that  Secretary  Bodman  and  others  kept  re-
ferring to was that, unlike in 2003, there were now over 33 IGCC plants that have
been proposed, even though a number of them had already been cancelled. In a fol-
low-up  conference  call  with  reporters,  Sell  claimed  that  ‘‘[t]his  fact,  this  changing
underlying  market  dynamic,  underpins  why  we  believe  our  new  approach  is  fun-
damentally better to advance the state of carbon capture and sequestration.’’ He ex-
pressed his confidence that restructured FutureGen was a better way to go. ‘‘We are
making this project better and we are increasing substantially the likelihood of suc-
cess.’’ 164 Sell  even  claimed  that  the  National  Energy  and  Technology  Lab’s  (NETL)
work gave him that confidence, despite the fact that NETL, FE and others had been
protesting for months that the new approach would not work.165

There  was  no  discussion  of  who  would  take  on  the  liability  for  sequestration  or
who was going to pay for the energy loss associated with CCS or how the technology
had suddenly advanced to viable commercialization. DOE would issue a Request for
Information  to  the  industry  to  determine  its  views  (which  had  not  been  sought  be-
fore the announcement). It would be followed by a competitive Funding Opportunity
Announcement.166 Any  loss  of  the  research  and  development  aspects  of  FutureGen
would be made up in a significant increase in the FY 2009 clean coal budget.167

The RFI asked for input and public comment on the restructured FutureGen and
expressions  of  interest  from  power  producers  who  would  consider  participating  in
the  revised  initiative.  These  responses  would  help  shape  a  competitive  funding  op-
portunity announcement expected to be released in June of 2008. DOE stated it was
interested  in  funding  multiple  demonstrations  of  CCS  technology  at  a  commercial
scale  of  at  least  300  gross  MW  per  unit  plant  power  train  per  demonstration.  It
would  contribute  no  more  than  the  incremental  cost  of  the  CCS  for  one  train.  At
least  1  million  metric  tons  of  CO2 would  be  stored  in  a  saline  storage  formation,
and  all  emissions  levels  for  other  pollutants  would  meet  the  original  FutureGen
goals. Commercial operations were expected to begin in 2015.168

Response to Restructured FutureGen and Request for Information

150

The response was quick and skeptical with most of the media viewing FutureGen
as dead. ‘‘The Administration has long trumpeted technology, not regulation, as the
answer  [to  global  warming].  There  was  no  trumpeting  last  week  when  it  unexpect-
edly canceled FutureGen—its much-touted, $1.8 billion attempt to develop a cutting
edge  coal  plant  that  would  turn  coal  to  gas,  strip  out  and  store  underground  the
carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change, and then burn the remaining gas
to produce hydrogen and electricity,’’ The New York Times wrote. ‘‘And what of Mr.
Bush’s  hydrogen-powered  Freedom  Car?  That,  too,  has  receded  from  view.’’  The
newspaper  described  the  decision  as  ending  a  four-year-old  program  that  had  been
described  as  ‘‘one  of  the  boldest  steps  our  nation  has  taken  toward  a  pollution-free
energy  future.’’ 169 The  St.  Louis  Post-Dispatch  opined  that  Secretary  Bodman  ap-
parently missed the part of Bush’s 2008 State of the Union address on the previous
day  where  the  President  urged  Congress  to  ‘‘fund  new  technologies  that  can  gen-
erate  coal  power  while  capturing  carbon  emissions.’’  IEEE  Spectrum  described  the
decision as bringing FutureGen to a ‘‘screeching end.’’ 170

The  responses  received  in  March  from  industry  to  the  Request  for  Information
were  more  damning.  There  were  49  responses,  almost  all  of  which  took  major  ‘‘ex-
ceptions  to  the  RFI  specifications  and  near  zero  emissions  objectives,’’  a  DOE  sum-
mary  document  reported.  Industry  wanted  the  solicitation  expanded  to  non-IGCC
technology; a ‘‘substantial relaxation’’ of the 90 percent carbon capture requirement;
government liability protection of the CCS aspects of the projects; elimination of the
mandate  to  sequester  one  million  tons  of  CO2 in  a  saline  aquifer  and  permission
to  sell  CO2 for  enhanced  oil  recovery;  guaranteed  funding  up  front;  an  expedited
NEPA process; a sharing of the additional operating and parasitic energy costs; and
reductions  in  the  performance  targets  of  sulfur,  nitrogen  oxide,  particulate  matter
and mercury. The comments also suggested that the schedule was unrealistic.171

The  comments  from  the  Coal  Utilization  Research  Council  (CURC),  an  industry
advocacy  group  that  focuses  on  the  technology  development  steps  necessary  to
achieve near zero emissions from coal power generation (and which opposed the ter-
mination of FutureGen), were particularly negative. There wasn’t enough money for
‘‘multiple’’  CCS  projects  (CURC  estimated  at  least  $600  million  needed  for  each
project), nor was there any assurance that Congress would provide funding; 90 per-
cent CO2 capture was not realistic for a commercial project; and non-IGCC projects
should be considered.

Given  the  immature  state  of  experience  in  using  capture  technology  integrated
with  an  IGCC,  for  example,  CURC  believes  it  is  much  more  prudent  to  simply
encourage  the  installation  of  CCS  technology  on  a  unit  that  will  be  commer-
cially-operated rather than dictate the level of capture. Industry should be free
to  determine  what  level  of  capture  of  CO2 makes  the  greatest  sense  from  both
a cost and acceptable risk exposure perspective.

CURC  also  estimated  that  installing  CCS  systems  on  to  commercial  projects
would  cost  hundreds  of  millions,  if  not  billions,  of  dollars,  and  the  owners  ‘‘should
not  be  restricted  to  the  90  percent  capture  requirement  that  is  otherwise  germane
to a technology demonstration project (i.e., FutureGen).’’ Additionally, a much larger
initiative  was  necessary  to  continue  a  large-scale,  industry-supported  CCS  imple-
mentation partnership.172

These  were  the  same  points  DOE  staff  had  raised  earlier.  In  an  issues  document
based  on  the  comments,  DOE  staff  wrote:  ‘‘In  the  current  environment,  utilities
planning  new  base  load  power  capacity  have  compelling  incentives  to  adopt  a  ‘wait
and see’ approach while issues related to retail competition and carbon management
are  resolved.  Moving  forward  with  CCS  at  this  time,  absent  legislation  or  other  in-
centives,  would  be  imprudent.’’  Industry  also  was  expressing  skepticism  about  gov-
ernment  support  for  the  new  program  because  of  the  change  in  direction  and  the
change in administrations.173

DOE  plowed  forward,  reiterating  once  again  to  Illinois  Congressional  members
that its approach would help permit new commercial coal plants.174 However, it hid
the  supposedly  ‘‘public’’  comments  from  the  public  and  the  press  by  refusing  all  re-
quests to release them.175

But  there  were  other  public  forums  which  clearly  exposed  the  problem  DOE  was
going  to  have  in  getting  responsive  proposals.  In  May  of  2008,  the  greenhouse  gas
research  and  development  program  and  the  clean  coal  center  of  the  International
Energy Agency held a workshop on financing CCS. The workshop participants’ view
was  that  private  investment  in  CCS  in  North  America  was  an  ‘‘unattractive  finan-
cial  option  without  Government  incentives  and  a  legal  framework  in  place.’’  As  a
representative  of  JP  Morgan  Chase  said,  CCS  has  no  positive  purpose.  It  only  has
a  negative  purpose  to  avoid  the  cost  of  putting  CO2 into  the  atmosphere,  and  that
has  no  cost  in  the  United  States.  The  investment  banks  wanted  a  ‘‘secure  return
on  their  investment,  such  as  loan  guarantees  or  tax  credits.’’  Legal  and  environ-
mental  liability  was  an  issue,  and  insurance  companies  were  not  ready  to  take  on
this risk. Until there was greater regulatory and cost recovery certainty, the private
sector would not invest. And, ‘‘ultimately, the willingness of ratepayers to pay high-
er  electricity  bills  to  pay  for  CCS,  as  reflected  in  decisions  by  local  public  utilities,
will be critical to the financing of such projects,’’ the participants agreed. ‘‘It is clear
that  CCS  is  not  economic  and  subsidies  will  be  needed  for  the  first  plants  . . ..
[F]inancing is the key and ultimately without financing there will be no CCS deploy-
ment.’’ 176

Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)

The  Draft  Funding  Opportunity  Announcement  was  issued  on  May  7,  2008.  De-
spite  the  RFI  comments,  it  remained  focused  on  a  gasifier  technology.  As  CURC
stated  in  its  comments,  the  FOA  described  a  commercial-scale  project  which  in-
cluded  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  original  FutureGen,  which  was  a  publicly  co-
funded demonstration-scale project, and that was not viable.

Included  among  our  suggested  modifications  are  changes  to  FOA  requirements
related to emission controls of criteria pollutants, beyond that which is required
for permitting plants today, a level of CO2 capture percentage that has not been
previously  achieved  in  power  plants  at  a  commercial  scale,  dates  for  operation
that may be difficult to achieve and other criteria that also may not be realistic
or  prudent  when  measured  against  the  business  requirements  of  a  facility,  or
facilities, planned and constructed to operate successfully in commerce.

CURC  reminded  DOE  of  its  earlier  comment  that  there  was  not  enough  money
for  multiple  projects,  and,  since  future  funding  was  not  guaranteed,  ‘‘there  are  not
clear  reasons  why  an  owner  or  operator  can  have  confidence  that  the  bulk  of  the
funding  for  a  selected  project  will  be  forthcoming  at  a  later  date.’’  CURC  rec-
ommended  a  reduction  below  the  81  percent  CO2 capture  level,  which  it  described
as  ‘‘not  a  reasonable  approach’’  at  this  stage  of  technology  development  or  integra-
tion.  ‘‘Industry  needs  to  obtain  baseline  data,  demonstrated  reliability  and  wide-
spread  confidence  in  CCS  systems  and  these  goals  can  be  achieved  more  cost-effec-
tively by requiring less aggressive percentages of capture.’’ 177

CURC also wanted more flexibility in the CO2 storage site, a regulatory structure
for  CO2 transport,  a  resolution  of  long-term  liability  issues,  more  favorable  cost-
sharing arrangements, including recognizing the parasitic energy loss as a cost, and
modifications  that  made  it  clear  that  non-IGCC  plants  were  eligible.178 In  a  sum-

because of the numerous plant modifications necessary in an IGCC plant to capture and seques-
ter  CO2,  ‘‘the  entire  plant  could  be  considered  a  stranded  asset.’’  Therefore,  the  entire  cost  of
the  plant  could  be  included  in  the  base  for  cost-sharing,  as  it  had  been  in  other  projects  were
novel technology is being tested. Ibid.

175 Despite requests under the Freedom of Information Act, DOE refused to release these com-
ments or those submitted on the draft Funding Opportunity Announcement until this committee
requested them. It provided no legitimate reason for withholding the comments beyond a claim
that  there  was  proprietary  information  in  some  of  the  responses.  See,  e.g.,  e-mail  entitled  ‘‘FG

mary of the unreleased ‘‘public’’ FOA comments, DOE indicated that they were simi-
lar to those submitted by CURC.179

The  final  FOA  made  some  of  those  changes.  A  non-gasification  project  did  not
have  to  produce  at  least  250  MW  net  electricity  output  but  could  be  at  a  ‘‘commer-
cially  viable  size.’’  There  was  no  mandatory  ceiling  on  the  project  cost.  The  appli-
cants  must  ‘‘propose’’  start-up  by  Dec.  31,  2015,  but  apparently  had  no  obligation
to  meet  that  date.  The  demonstrations  were  ‘‘expected’’  to  operate  for  three  to  five
years  and  capture  one  million  metric  tons  of  CO2 per  year  that  would  be  put  in  a
saline ‘‘formation,’’ not an aquifer as originally required. There was no obligation to
operate  after  the  demonstration  period,  and  monitoring  of  the  sequestration  site
would  continue  for  only  two  years  after  the  demonstration  was  completed.  DOE
would contribute the lesser of (1) the incremental cost of implementing CCS on the
demonstration unit; or (2) 50 percent of the total allowable project cost. DOE’s max-
imum cost would be negotiated prior to the award. Applications were due on October
8, 2008, with selections made by the end of the year.180

In  the  final  FOA,  DOE  bragged  again  that  ‘‘[t]oday,  more  than  ever,  the
FutureGen concept holds great promise for sustaining near-term coal utilization.’’ 181
Internally,  staff  saw  it  quite  differently.  The  goals  that  Secretary  Bodman  had
promised when he rolled out the restructured FutureGen were no longer mandatory.
‘‘The  reality  of  Financial  Assistance  awards  is  that  they  should  be  viewed  as  ‘‘best
effort,’’ Keith Miles wrote.

DOE asks for the Applicant to address all of the requirements (goals and objec-
tives),  provide  a  Statement  of  Project  Objectives  (SOPO)  as  well  as  the  evalua-
tion criteria in the FOA, which will ultimately be reviewed by DOE with selec-
tions made. Unfortunately there are no ‘‘consequences’’ if they don’t achieve the
goals  and  objectives  contained  in  their  SOPO.  DOE’s  only  recourse  is  when  an
issue of ‘‘noncompliance’’ arises, or research misconduct.182

No  one—except  those  who  may  have  drunk  the  Kool-Aid  at  DOE—was  surprised
at the anemic response to the FOA. In the end, almost no one came to DOE’s party,
and it wasn’t the party that had been advertised in the invitation. There were four
applications, two of which did not come close to meeting the criteria. Neither of the
survivors  proposed  an  IGCC/CCS  plant,  but  hoped  to  test  out  experimental  carbon
capture  technology  on  existing  facilities.  It  was  reported  that  even  those  applica-
tions  were  incomplete.183 In  January  of  2009,  Secretary  Bodman  and  his  deputies
slipped  out  of  town  minus  viable  projects  or  even  press  releases  claiming  success.

Relationship with International Partners

Despite the years-long push to get other countries involved in FutureGen and the
emphasis  by  high-level  Bush  officials  on  international  participation  in  FutureGen,
DOE  did  not  discuss  its  change  in  plans  with  its  international  partners.  Nor  did  it
take  any  steps  to  inform  the  State  Department’s  and  its  own  international  staff,
which were continuing to solicit foreign partners. In a presentation to Brazil in Oc-
tober, FutureGen was described as a ‘‘unique opportunity to prove carbon sequestra-
tion  . . .  [and]  to  advance  IGCC  technology.’’  International  participation  would  fa-
cilitate  implementation  of  CCS  in  emerging  economies.184 In  November,  Secretary
Bodman, who had met previously with Polish officials, sent a letter encouraging Po-
land to join the initiative.185

In  December,  Treasury  Secretary  Paulson  in  a  speech  before  the  Asia  Society
prior to another SED meeting with China stated that the FutureGen clean coal de-
velopment partnership with China represented one ‘‘of the best areas of on-going co-
operation.’’ 186

When  Karen  Harbert,  DOE’s  Assistant  Secretary  for  policy  and  international  af-
fairs,  asked  how  international  partners  could  be  incorporated  into  the  new

FutureGen,  she  was  bluntly  told  that  it  had  no  international  component.187 But
when  Japanese  officials  sent  a  draft  of  a  ‘‘framework’’  for  a  FutureGen  agreement
between the U.S. and Japan and a $10 million contribution on January 18, Harbert
told  them  to  ‘‘hold  tight.’’  Japan  had  hoped  to  have  it  signed  in  the  next  week  at
the  World  Economic  Forum  and  had  already  put  $700,000  in  its  budget  for  the
project.188 In  the  final  draft  of  the  supporting  documentation  for  the  restructured
FutureGen,  DOE  removed  all  references  to  foreign  governments’  having  access  to
test  demonstration  results  because  ‘‘they  wouldn’t  have  access  to  any  of  the  ‘good’
proprietary  information,  but  rather  only  the  non-proprietary  information  which
DOE always makes publicly available for any of projects anyhow.’’ 189

In  a  draft  memo  prepared  for  James  Slutz  to  issue  after  the  January  30  an-
nouncement, the partners were to be told, ‘‘The commercial market place will be the
mechanism  to  deploy  new  technology  such  as  Integrated  Gasification  Combined
Cycle  (IGCC)  with  CCS.’’  DOE  was,  however,  ‘‘committed  to  an  international  out-
reach component’’ which was ‘‘critical to garnering broad acceptance of the new tech-
nology and fostering the replication of the near zero-emissions on a broad scale.’’ In
other words, ‘‘thanks, but no thanks.’’ 190

On  Feb.  1,  2008,  Secretary  Bodman  sent  out  letters  to  all  the  current  and  poten-
tial foreign partners telling them that FutureGen was being restructured to empha-
size  commercial  demonstration  of  CCS  with  IGCC  plants,  and  that  he  looked  for-
ward  to  ‘‘continued  outreach’’  to  the  interested  countries.191 The  first—and  most
angry—response came from Korea. Kijune Kim of the Ministry of Commerce, Indus-
try and Energy, wrote,

I  am  really  surprised  that  I  had  no  prior  explanation  of  that  restructuring  in-
tention  from  DOE  before  . . .  Korea  really  tried  our  best  to  cooperate  with  US
to  develop  FutureGen  project  since  early  2006  . . ..  We  contributed  $2  million
in March 2007 . . .. actively participated in four meetings . . . even hosted the
third  negotiating  meeting  for  the  FutureGen  project  agreement  last  October  in
Seoul to make the project move on. If you have recognized all Korea’s endeavor
regarding the project, it is not the appropriate way to deliver U.S. DOE’s inten-
tion to restructure FutureGen project by sending me an e-mail . . . without any
prior consultation or explanation to Korea.

Mr. Kim concluded by pointedly noting ‘‘that there were better ways (both procedure
and  timing)  to  inform  Korea  US  DOE’s  intention  to  restructure  FutureGen
project.’’ 192

After  the  announcement,  the  State  Department  asked  if  DOE  had  talking  points
to  use  with  foreign  audiences.  Norway  and  Russia  had  expressed  interest  in
FutureGen;  other  embassies  had  pro-FutureGen  points  in  their  standard  talks  on
energy  and  climate.193 On  February  1,  2008,  David  Mulford,  the  U.S.  ambassador
to  India,  wrote  Secretary  Bodman  expressing  concern  about  the  FutureGen  project
based  on  his  reading  of  media  reports.  ‘‘Since  I  will  have  to  address  the  issue  soon
with the Government of India (GOI) and the Indian media, I would appreciate some
clarification  . . ..  This  would  include  the  specific  issue  of  the  status  of  India’s
pledged monetary commitment.’’ The ambassador reiterated India’s ambitious plans
to  expand  its  all  coal-fired  thermal  capacity  and  asked  the  Secretary  for  his  views
‘‘on  how  to  continue  cooperation  with  India  in  clean-coal  power  generation  tech-
nology  and  mitigation  of  related  carbon  emissions.’’ 194 Australia  also  wondered
what was up. ‘‘The restructuring of FutureGen has been a hot topic for our media,’’
Australia’s clean coal manager in the Department of Resources Energy and Tourism
wrote.  We  have  also  been  fielding  representations  from  our  own  industry  including

companies involved in the FutureGen Alliance . . .. [W]e need to get a better under-
standing of what this means in terms of the International Partnership and the asso-
ciated agreement being negotiated with other Governments.’’ 195

In February, Secretary Bodman received a letter from the Australian minister for
resources,  energy  and  tourism,  who—based  on  the  September  4,  2007,  joint  state-
ment  by  Prime  Minister  Howard  and  President  Bush—was  looking  forward  to  ‘‘a
program  of  consultation  at  both  the  government  and  industry  level  including  the
means by which information on technological advances will be shared.’’ 196 Secretary
Bodman  responded  with  a  letter  stating  that  DOE  ‘‘will  continue  to  keep  you  in-
formed  of  significant  developments  in  the  FutureGen  program  and  look  forward  to
future  collaborations  with  Australia.’’ 197 That  appears  to  have  been  the  end  of  any
real effort for international cooperation on FutureGen, once a ‘‘core objective’’ of the
project, although FE attempted through the spring to gin up interest. Its staff made
presentations  to  various  embassies  claiming  that  the  international  component  was
a  ‘‘key  priority’’  in  the  restructured  FutureGen  with  a  focus  on  a  ‘‘non-proprietary
information exchange.’’ 198 Their objective was to convey ‘‘the clear message that the
U.S.  commitment  to  clean  coal  remains  stronger  than  ever  under  the  restructured
FutureGen.’’ 199

By the end of June, 2008 DOE claimed that it was still ‘‘exploring ways to engage
governments in deploying Near-Zero Emission Coal plants with CCS for deployment
around the world.’’ It proposed workshops and symposia to share non-proprietary in-
formation  and  the  development  of  global  outreach  strategies  for  acceptance  of  the
technology and gamely claimed that all of the previously interested countries would
‘‘likely have continued interest’’ in the outcome of FutureGen.200 Jim Connaughton,
CEQ  Chief  and  loyal  Bush  soldier,  was  quoted  in  the  Indian  press  as  saying  that
there would be three to four zero emission coal-fired power plants and even greater
international  participation  in  the  restructured  FutureGen,  although  there  was  no
evidence that either one of those statements was accurate.201

Australia,  however,  went  ahead  on  its  own.  After  the  fall  of  the  Howard  govern-
ment,  it  ratified  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and  established  its  own  fund  to  pursue  CCS
demonstration projects in Australia.202

Peabody Energy, one of the FutureGen partners which already had a presence in
China, signed an agreement in December of 2007 with China Huaneng Group to in-
vest  in  an  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  power  plant  near  Tianjin,  south-
east  of  Beijing  called  GreenGen,  although  there  will  be  no  CCS  until  its  ‘‘later
phases.’’

Abu  Dhabi  is  designing  an  IGCC  plant  with  BP  and  Rio  Tinto  that  is  supposed

to produce hydrogen for energy and CO2 to be sequestered.203

Conclusion

FutureGen  began  life  as  the  centerpiece  of  the  Bush  Administration’s  climate
change technologies. This initiative held out the promise of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions without the pain of signing up to the Kyoto Protocols. In abandoning the
original concept, the Department of Energy left the country with no coherent strat-

Whether  the  new  Administration  and  Congress  should  revive  the  original  program,
which  was  ready  to  begin  work  when  the  Department  of  Energy  killed  it,  or  move
to  some  other  initiative,  is  an  open  question.  It  is  absolutely  clear  that  the  ‘‘Plan
B’’ initiative sold to the public and the Congress by Secretary Bodman will not pro-

Progress  on  the  great  challenges  to  harness  technology  to  build  a  greener  energy
future was stalled, and the United States abandoned its global leadership role.

This is a disappointing legacy for the Department of Energy.
