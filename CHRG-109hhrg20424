1. Purpose

On  Thursday,  April  14,  2005,  the  House  Committee  on  Science  will  hold  its  an-
nual  hearing  to  hear  from  teachers  on  how  the  Federal  Government  can  help  im-
prove  K–12  math  and  science  education.  Five  elementary  school  math  and  science
teachers  will  testify  before  the  Committee.  They  are  in  town  this  week  to  receive
the  2004  Presidential  Award  for  Excellence  in  Mathematics  and  Science  Teaching,
the  Nation’s  highest  commendation  for  K–12  math  and  science  educators.  At  the
conclusion  of  the  formal  hearing  process,  the  other  awardees,  who  will  also  be  in
attendance  at  the  hearing,  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to  make  brief  statements
on the subject of K–12 math and science education. Their comments will be entered
into the official hearing record.

3. Background

On  April  26,  1983,  a  blue-ribbon  commission  appointed  by  the  Reagan  Adminis-
tration  released  ‘‘A  Nation  at  Risk,’’  a  report  containing  strong  language  and  dis-
turbing findings on the state of education in the U.S. In one of its more memorable
lines,  the  report  stated,  ‘‘If  any  unfriendly  foreign  power  had  attempted  to  impose
on  America  the  mediocre  education  performance  that  exists  today,  we  might  well
have viewed it as an act of war.’’ Included among the ‘‘indicators of risk’’ were inter-
national  comparisons  of  student  achievement,  which  revealed  that  U.S.  students
were  never  first  or  second  on  any  of  19  different  academic  tests,  and  they  scored
in  last  place  in  seven  of  them.  National  assessments  also  showed  a  steady  decline
in science achievement scores of U.S. 17-year-olds.

Today, U.S., educators, researchers, policy-makers and the general public use the
National  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress  (NAEP),  a  congressionally-mandated
project  of  the  National  Center  for  Education  Statistics  at  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education  (ED),  to  determine  what  students  know  and  can  do  in  various  subject
areas.  While  NAEP  does  not,  and  is  not  designed  to,  report  on  the  performance  of
individual students, it does compare student achievement in states and other juris-
dictions and track changes in the achievement of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grad-
ers over time in mathematics, reading, writing, science, and other content areas.

In  mathematics,  the  2003  NAEP  results  (the  latest  report  available)  found  the
performance of fourth and eighth graders increased steadily from 1990 to 2003, and
the  average  scores  in  2003  were  higher  than  in  all  previous  assessments.  More  en-
couraging, some of the lowest-performing students made the greatest improvements.
The proportion of African-American and Hispanic fourth graders reaching the basic
achievement level—the level of minimum competency—in mathematics rose from 36
to  54  percent  and  42  to  62  percent  respectively.  It  was  also  notable  that  these
achievements  occurred  while  higher-scoring  students  also  made  gains,  although  at
a somewhat slower rate.

This  represents  real  progress,  but  many  U.S.  students  are  still  not  proficient  in
mathematics.  While  the  2003  NAEP  showed  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  stu-
dents  reaching  the  proficient  level,  only  32  percent  in  grade  four  and  29  percent  in
grade eight were able to do so and even smaller proportions were able to reach the
advanced levels. In addition, while the 2003 NAEP did not assess students in grade
12,  the  2000  NAEP  found  that  35  percent  of  twelfth  graders  were  below  the  basic
achievement  level  in  mathematics,  reinforcing  the  concern  that  achievement  falters
as students progress from middle school to high school.

In  science,  the  2000  NAEP  (the  latest  report  available)  showed  that  the  average
scores of fourth and eighth graders were essentially unchanged from 1996 while the
scores  for  twelfth  graders  declined  by  three  points—a  significant  decline.  Specifi-
cally,  in  2000,  only  29  percent  of  fourth  graders  scored  proficient  or  better  as  did
32  percent  of  eighth  graders  and  18  percent  of  twelfth  graders.  Worse,  scores  for
American  Indian  students  in  eight  grade  and  white  students  in  twelfth  grade  fell
from 1996 to 2000.

For a comparative perspective on education in the U.S. and in other industrialized
nations,  the  U.S.  uses  the  Trends  in  International  Mathematics  and  Science  Study
(TIMSS),  an  assessment  given  every  four  years,  to  provide  participating  nations
with  information  on  their  students’  understanding  of  math  and  science.  The  2003
TIMSS,  issued  in  December  2004,  showed  that  the  absolute  scores  of  U.S.  fourth
and  eighth  grade  students  improved.  However,  while  the  relative  rank  of  U.S.
eighth  graders  improved,  the  rank  of  fourth  graders  dropped.  U.S.  students  per-
formed  in  the  middle  ranks  of  students  in  mathematics  (in  which  students  from
about  35  nations  were  tested),  and  somewhat  higher  in  science  (in  which  students
from about 15 nations were tested). U.S. students did not lead in any category.

The  2003  TIMSS  did  not  assess  12th  graders  but  another  international  assess-
ment, the Program for International Student Achievement (PISA), showed American
15-year-olds  performing  below  the  international  average  in  mathematics  literacy
and problem-solving.

While U.S. undergraduate and graduate education remains the envy of the world,
the  interest  of,  and  the  participation  by  U.S.  students  in  science,  technology,  engi-
neering  and  math  is  declining.  In  fact,  25–30  percent  of  entering  freshmen  express
an interest in science and engineering, but less than half complete a science or engi-
neering  degree  in  five  years.  As  the  number  of  U.S.  science  and  engineering  stu-
dents  declines,  our  dependence  on  foreign  students  grows.  According  to  NSF’s
Science  and  Engineering  Indicators  (2002),  the  percentage  of  foreign-born  individ-
uals  among  scientists  and  engineers  in  the  U.S.  is  growing  at  all  degree  levels,  in
all sectors, and in most fields. Especially high percentages are found in engineering
(45 percent), computer sciences (43 percent) and mathematics (30 percent).
Issues in K–12 Education

Over  the  years,  education  research  and  successful  reform  initiatives  have  under-
scored  the  importance  of  having  a  qualified  teacher.  Yet,  in  response  to  impending
teacher  shortages,  particularly  in  mathematics  and  science,  many  states  have  al-
lowed individuals without the appropriate background to teach. In fact, the Depart-
ment  of  Education’s  2004  ‘‘Condition  of  Education’’  report  found  that  49  percent  of
seventh  grade  mathematics  teachers  did  not  have  the  equivalent  of  a  minor  in
mathematics, and that 32 percent of middle school science teachers did not have the
equivalent  of  a  minor  in  any  of  the  sciences.  Not  surprising,  high  school  students
in high minority and high poverty public schools fared even worse with more science
and mathematics courses taught by out-of-field teachers.

A  related  problem  is  the  exodus  of  new  teachers  from  the  profession,  with  more
than 30 percent leaving within five years. High teacher turnover creates a continual
demand for new teachers, and those teachers require teacher professional education
and development. Partly as a result, many schools are moving toward the regulation
of  teaching  practice,  such  as  the  use  of  more  scripted  curriculum  materials—a
change that may limit some able teachers from exercising their professional knowl-
edge and discretion, making teaching less inviting to those most qualified.

To achieve the twin goals of improving education and narrowing the achievement
gap,  No  Child  Left  Behind—President  Bush’s  comprehensive  K–12  education  law—
requires  a  ‘‘highly  qualified’’  teacher  in  every  classroom,  it  raises  the  qualifications
of  paraprofessionals  (also  known  as  teacher  aides)  and  it  requires  public  reporting
of staff qualifications. It also provides state grants to recruit and train teachers.

At  its  center,  No  Child  Left  Behind  seeks  to  hold  schools  accountable  for  the
progress  of  their  students  by  requiring  annual  testing  for  all  students  in  grades  3–
8  in  reading  and  math  and  by  ensuring  that  all  students  make  ‘‘annual  yearly
progress’’  toward  proficiency  in  these  subjects,  the  prime  measure  of  success  under
the  law.  Failure  to  do  so  results  in  a  school  being  identified  as  ‘‘needing  improve-
ment,’’ which triggers various interventions, such as choices for parents and correc-
tive  actions.  In  addition,  states  are  required  to  have  academic-content  standards  in
place for science by the 2005–2006 school year and, beginning in 2007–2008, states
will  also  have  to  test  in  science  at  least  once  in  each  of  the  3–5,  6–9  and  10–12
grade spans. But science test results will not be counted as a factor in determining
whether a school or district is making adequate yearly progress unless states volun-
tarily decide to impose that step.

While many have credited the new law with the improvement in student achieve-
ment  on  national  and  international  assessments,  others  have  complained  that  the
reliance  on  testing  has  resulted  in  ‘‘teaching  to  the  test’’  and  ‘‘dumbing  down  the
curriculum.’’  In  addition,  while  the  science  requirements  under  No  Child  Left  Be-
hind  have  placed  a  renewed  emphasis  on  the  subject,  including  the  design  of  new
tests  and  the  reform  of  science  courses  to  align  them  to  state  standards,  many  be-
lieve  that  the  more  immediate  pressures  in  reading  and  mathematics  will  keep
science at the margins of education.
National Science Foundation (NSF) K–12 Education Programs

Math and Science Partnership Program

No Child Left Behind also called for the creation of a new Math and Science Part-
nership  Program  at  NSF  to  bring  together  higher  education,  school  systems  and
businesses. Ultimately, Congress created two complementary programs: one at NSF
and  one  at  ED.  The  NSF  program  awards  grants  on  a  peer-reviewed,  competitive
basis  to  partnerships  between  institutions  of  higher  education  and  one  or  more
school  districts  to  improve  math  and  science  education.  Funds  are  used  to  develop
innovative  reform  programs  that,  if  proven  successful,  would  be  the  key  to  large-
scale  reform  at  the  state  level.  The  ED  program  allocates  funding  on  the  basis  of
population  and  poverty  to  all  50  states,  which  then  compete  the  funding  to  math
and science partnerships at the local level.

The  Administration’s  fiscal  year  2005  (FY05)  budget  attempted  to  zero  out  the
NSF  program  and  transfer  the  remaining  $120  million  to  ED.  The  Science  Com-
mittee  opposed  the  move  in  its  FY05  Views  and  Estimates.  In  relevant  part,  the
Committee stated:

The  Committee  is  especially  troubled  by  the  proposal  to  eliminate  the  NSF’s
Math  and  Science  Partnership  Program.  This  program  was  specifically  author-
ized as part of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002. The
Committee strongly believes that NSF is the only federal agency with a proven
record  of  selecting  education  projects  that  offer  the  best  hope  to  narrow  the
achievement  gap  and  raise  student  performance  in  math  and  science.  Through
its  competitive,  merit-based  process,  NSF  is  uniquely  qualified  to  use  its  dec-
ades  of  experience  in  education  research  and  evaluation  to  appraise  grant  pro-
posals and to strengthen the link between research findings and classroom prac-
tice. The Partnerships program should be funded at the authorized level of $200
million.

This transfer was ultimately rejected by the Congress. While the President’s FY06
budget request did not renew the call for the transfer, it requested only $80 million
to meet existing obligations under the NSF program. Further, the request increased
funding  for  the  ED  program  and  made  clear  that  no  new  NSF  grants  would  be
awarded in FY06.

Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education

NSF  also  sponsors  a  number  of  other  programs  through  its  Division  of  Elemen-
tary,  Secondary,  and  Informal  Education  that  are  designed  to  improve  pre-K–12
science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics  education.  Some,  such  as  the  In-
structional  Materials  Development  Program,  are  designed  to  develop  and  dissemi-
nate  instructional  materials  and  assessments.  Others,  like  the  Informal  Science
Education Program, are designed to promote learning outside the classroom, includ-
ing through the media, museum exhibits and community-based organizations. Fund-

ing  for  Elementary,  Secondary  and  Informal  Education  at  NSF—a  division  of  the
Education  and  Human  Resources  Directorate—totaled  approximately  $181  million
in FY05. The President’s FY06 budget request provides only $141 million. The com-
mittee expressed its concern in its FY06 Views and Estimates. In part:

The Committee is especially disturbed by the proposed cuts in NSF’s Education
and  Human  Resources  (EHR)  Directorate.  Since  1950,  NSF  has  been  tasked
with  strengthening  math  and  science  education  programs  at  all  levels.  Yet
under  the  budget  proposal,  the  overall  investment  in  education  at  NSF  would
drop  from  $841.4  million  in  FY05  to  $737  million  in  FY06  (down  12  percent).
Much  of  the  decrease  would  occur  in  the  Elementary,  Secondary,  and  Informal
Education  (ESIE)  account,  which  would  drop  from  $182  million  to  $141  mil-
lion....
NSF’s  education  programs  are  unique  in  their  capacity  to  develop  new  and  im-
proved  materials  and  assessments,  create  better  teacher  training  techniques
and  move  promising  ideas  from  research  to  practice.  The  Committee  fears  that
disinvestments  in  this  area  will  deprive  states,  school  districts  and  schools  of
the  tools  and  ideas  they  need  to  achieve  the  goals  of  the  No  Child  Left  Behind
Act. NSF’s EHR programs should receive at least level funding in FY06.

Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching

In  1983,  President  Reagan  signed  into  a  law  a  program  establishing  the  Presi-
dential  Award  for  Excellence  in  Mathematics  and  Science  Teaching  to  identify  out-
standing science and mathematics teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade. The
program,  which  is  administered  by  NSF,  identifies  outstanding  science  and  mathe-
matics teachers, kindergarten through 12th grade, in each state. These teachers are
to  serve  as  models  for  their  colleagues  and  will  be  leaders  in  the  improvement  of
science  and  mathematics  education.  In  fact,  since  1983  over  3,000  teachers  have
been  selected  to  enter  the  network  of  Presidential  Awardees.  While  most  have  re-
mained  in  the  classroom,  some  have  become  school  principals,  supervisors,  super-
intendents and college faculty.

Recognition is given to K–12 teachers in four award groups: (l) elementary mathe-
matics,  (2)  elementary  science,  (3)  secondary  mathematics,  and  (4)  secondary
science,  with  the  secondary  groups  including  middle,  junior,  and  senior  high  school
teachers. The award now alternates yearly by grade level. This year, the award will
recognize  teachers  of  grades  K–6,  with  one  elementary  math  and  one  elementary
science awardee from each state.

Teachers  applying  for  the  award  must  be  nominated.  Anyone  may  nominate  a
teacher  (self-nominations,  however,  are  not  accepted),  and  then  a  state  selection
committee chooses three finalists from each award group for recognition at the state
level.  A  national  selection  committee,  comprising  prominent  mathematicians,  sci-
entists  and  educators,  reviews  the  state-level  finalists  and  makes  award  rec-
ommendations  to  NSF  and  the  President.  Each  award  includes  a  $10,000  award
from  the  NSF  for  the  recipient’s  school  and  a  Presidential  citation.  In  addition,
awardees  are  invited  to  attend  an  award  ceremony  and  other  Washington  recogni-
tion events, including meetings with leaders in government and education.
4. Questions for Witnesses

The panelists were asked to address the following questions in their testimony be-

fore the Committee:

• Based  on  the  involvement  you  have  had  with  federal  math  and  science  pro-
grams,  what  are  the  most  important  and  effective  components  of  these  pro-
grams?
• What  are  the  factors  that  limit  the  performance  of  students  and  teachers  in
math  and  science?  What  is  the  single,  most  important  step  that  the  Federal
Government should take to improve math and science education?
• What elements of your pre-service or in-service training have been most help-
ful  in  meeting  the  daily  demands  of  working  with  students,  developing  inno-
vative  classroom  strategies  and  delivering  content  rich  instruction  to  a  di-
verse group of students?

Chairman BOEHLERT. The hearing will come to order.
I am going to keep my opening remarks brief, because I have had
the privilege of having breakfast this morning with our presidential
awardees,  and  what  a  pleasure  it  was  to  start  off  the  day  with
them.

Let  me  just  say,  though,  that  there  is  no  issue  within  our  juris-
diction  that  I  care  more  deeply  about  than  science  and  math  edu-
cation,  especially  at  the  pre-college  level,  and  I  suspect  that  every
one of my colleagues here today would say the same thing.

None  of  the  other  things  this  committee  wants  to  see  done,
whether it is developing a hydrogen car or maintaining a presence
in space, none of these things can be accomplished unless we have
the  scientists  and  engineers  to  do  the  work  in  a  scientifically  lit-
erate  society  that  will  support  and  learn  from  it.  And  of  course,
there is only one way we can create those scientists and engineers
and educated citizens, and that is through education, starting from
earliest childhood.

And  who  will  do  the  educating?  Parents,  surely,  and,  for  better
or  worse,  the  popular  culture.  But  the  most  critical  component  in
the whole system are our nation’s teachers. That is why one of the
first  hearings  I  held  as  Chairman  of  this  committee  was  with  the
Presidential Math and Science Teaching Awardees, and I promised
to make this an annual event.

Let  me  say  how  refreshing  it  was  for  the  first  time—we  talk  a
lot  about  education,  we  talk  a  lot  about  teaching.  We  ought  to  do
more listening, and I can’t think of a better group to listen to than
the  people  before  me,  not  just  those  of  you  who  are  on  the  panel,
but  all  of  those  educators  that  you  represent  who  are  so  dedicated
and so devoted.

You  would  think  that  this  kind  of  hearing  would  be  happening
all  of  the  time,  but  unfortunately,  that  is  not  the  case.  Instead,
Congress  talks  constantly  about  education,  but  it  rarely  listens.
And  it  listens  least  of  all  to  the  most  important  experts,  actual
classroom teachers, the folks at the front lines of our nation’s edu-
cation  system.  And  let  me  tell  you  something.  We  talk  about  edu-
cation.  Everybody  in  this  town  likes  to  talk  about  the  importance
of national security. This is a national security issue of the highest
order,  educating  our  young  people,  particularly  in  the  math  and
science disciplines. And if you want to be encouraged about the op-
portunities  for  careers,  because  everybody  expects  the  same  thing,
you work hard, you do what mom and dad or your preacher or your
priest  or  your  rabbi  tells  you  to  do,  you  get  good  grades,  and  you
come out and say, ‘‘Here I am world.’’ If there are no job opportuni-
ties,  all  of  that  seems  to  be  for  naught.  I  will  tell  you,  in  my  area
alone,  in  central  New  York,  they  are  trying  to  hire  1,200,  not  12,
not  112,  but  1,200  engineers.  I  had  meetings  yesterday  to  talk  to
these  people  about  them.  Workforce  development,  there  isn’t  a
Member  of  Congress  who  doesn’t  face  that.  Every  time  I  go  back
home to talk to the business leaders, they say, ‘‘We have got to de-
velop a better-educated workforce.’’ And I say, ‘‘You are right.’’ And
I  wish  I  could  bring  all  of  those  captains  of  industry  down  here  to
listen to this panel.

I  am  excited  about  your  presentation,  as  I  am  every  year.  And
you will see Members of Congress coming and going, because quite

frankly, while a lot of people are under the misunderstanding that
Members  of  Congress  don’t  work  very  hard,  I  can  tell  you  they
work  very  hard.  And  Members  of  Congress  are  not  just  on  a  Com-
mittee, like this Science Committee, as important as it is, they are
on  defense  committees  and  committees  dealing  with  foreign  policy
and  agriculture  and  education,  a  whole  wide  range  of  subjects.  So
people come and go because they are jockeying their schedule, and
you  will  see  Members  come  in  and  go  out.  It  is  not  because  of  any
lack  of  interest.  It  is  because  they  are  all  someplace  doing  some-
thing.  Woody  Allen  says,  ‘‘Everybody  has  to  be  someplace.’’  Well,
here  we  are.  And  boy,  I  am  happy  to  be  here.  And  I  am  happy  to
be  here  to  introduce  you  to  my  associate  in  this  venture,  my  part-
ner, the Ranking Minority Member, Mr. Gordon of Tennessee.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Boehlert follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I’m going to keep my opening comments brief so we can get to our impressive wit-

nesses without further delay.

Let me just say, though, that there is no issue within our jurisdiction that I care
about  more  deeply  than  science  and  math  education,  especially  at  the  pre-college
level. And I suspect that every one of my colleagues on this dais would say the same
thing.

None  of  the  other  things  this  committee  wants  to  see  done—whether  it’s  devel-
oping a hydrogen car or maintaining a presence in space—none of these things can
be  accomplished  unless  we  have  the  scientists  and  engineers  to  do  the  work  and  a
scientifically literate citizenry who will support it and learn from it. And, of course,
there’s only one way we can create those scientists and engineers and educated citi-
zens, and that’s through education—starting from earliest childhood.

And who will do the educating? Parents, surely, and, for better or worse, the pop-
ular culture. But most critical are our nation’s teachers. That’s why one of the first
hearings I held as Chairman of this committee was with the Presidential Math and
Science  Teaching  Awardees,  and  I  promised  then  to  make  the  hearing  an  annual
event.

You’d think that this sort of hearing would be happening all the time, but, unfor-
tunately,  that’s  not  the  case.  Instead,  Congress  talks  constantly  about  education,
but it rarely listens, and it listens least of all to the most important experts—actual
classroom  teachers,  the  folks  at  the  front  lines  of  our  nation’s  educational  system.
So  today’s  hearing  offers  us  a  rare  opportunity  to  hear  directly  from  teachers—
and not just any teachers, but those who have been recognized as the best. So we’re
eager to hear what you have to say.

We  want  especially  to  learn  how  the  Federal  Government  can  help  you  do  your
jobs. Which federal programs have been helpful and which have not worked? Please
be candid and specific in your answers, and describe particular experiences that you
have  had.  We  hear  policy  prescriptions  and  theories  all  the  time;  we  want  to  hear
from you about real life.

But  before  we  begin,  let  me  just  congratulate  each  of  you,  not  only  for  winning
this  prestigious  award,  but  for  doing  the  incredible  work  that  enabled  you  to  earn
it.  We  want  to  hear  from  as  many  of  you  as  possible,  so  we’ll  go  through  our  usual
hearing—listening to testimony and asking questions to our panel of four teachers—
and  then,  if  time  allows,  we’ll  open  the  floor  for  a  while  to  comments  from  any  of
the other awardees.

I’m eager to hear your testimony.
Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  join  you  in
welcoming  all  of  these  outstanding  teachers  to  our  meeting  today.
In  Washington,  we  are  often  not  very  brief,  and  we  don’t  worry
about duplication, but when we occasionally do, we say we want to
associate ourselves with the remarks of the, whomever it might be,
and  I  certainly  want  to  associate  myself  with  the  remarks  of  our
Chairman, who really summed up my feelings and most folks’ feel-
ings here about the importance of the job that you do, because you
really  are  the  men  and  women  that  serve  on  the  front  lines  with

K–12  in  math  and  science.  And  as  a  son  of  two  teachers,  I  admire
the skill and the dedication of all of you outstanding teachers. And
I want to extend my very sincere congratulations to all of you.

And  I  would  particularly  like  to  acknowledge  and  congratulate
one  of  our  witnesses,  my  constituent,  Ms.  Cynthia  Cliche  from
Homer  Pittard  Campus  School  in  my  hometown  of  Murfreesboro,
Tennessee.  In  addition  to  teaching  the  first  grade,  Cynthia  is  a
Math  Methods  instructor  at  Middle  Tennessee  State  University,
also my alma mater, so as you can see, there is some overlap here.
There  is  no  more  important  job—and  also  I  had  nothing  to  do
with  this  election.  There  is  no  more  important  job  than  the  one
these  teachers  perform  every  day.  Their  efforts  inspire  the  next
generation  of  scientists,  mathematicians,  and  engineers  who  will
make  the  discoveries  and  create  the  technological  marvels  of  the
future.

And  today,  the  Science  Committee  has  the  privilege  of  hearing
from some of the best math and science teachers in the Nation, and
I hope to learn what attracted you to teaching careers and the fac-
tors  that  led  to  your  outstanding  success  as  math  and  science
teachers,  and  what  it  will  take  to  replicate  your  success  and  in-
crease  your  numbers.  And  I  would  also  appreciate  hearing  about
your  experiences  with  federally-sponsored  teacher  professional  de-
velopment  programs  and  the  activities  that  resulted  in  new,  and
hopefully  improved,  teaching  materials.  This  is  particularly  impor-
tant  to  us  right  now,  because  many  of  us  are  concerned  that  the
current  science—or  not  only  on  the  Science  Committee,  but
throughout  Congress,  we  are  very  concerned  that  the  fiscal  year
2006  budget  contemplates  a  significant  reduction  in  the  programs
that support K–12 science and math education. So I hope that you
are  going  to  give  us  some  ammunition  to  combat  the  folks  that
want to do that.

And  I  would  also  be  interested  in  hearing  about  the  experiences
that  the  expert  teachers  here  this  morning  have  had  with  the  Na-
tional Science Foundation-supported education programs and what
value they would place on these programs.

Again,  I  want  to  congratulate  not  only  our  witnesses  but  all  of
you  here  today,  you  outstanding  teachers,  for  contributions  that
you are making yourself to our country, but more importantly, real-
ly,  for  the  inspiration  in  all  of  those  apostles  that  you  are  sending
out to help others.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  join  you  in  welcoming  the  many  outstanding

teachers present in our hearing room this morning.

Our witnesses, and their colleagues in the audience, have come to Washington to
receive the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.
These  are  the  men  and  women  who  serve  with  distinction  on  the  front  lines  of  K–
12 science and math education.

As the son of two teachers, I admire the skill and dedication of these outstanding

teachers and extend my warmest congratulations to each of them.

I  would  particularly  like  to  acknowledge  and  congratulate  one  of  our  witnesses,
and  my  constituent,  Ms.  Cynthia  Lynn  Cliche  from  Homer  Pittard  Campus  School
in Murfreesboro, TN.

She  is  a  graduate  of  Ball  State  University  and  received  a  Master’s  degree  from

Berry College.

In  addition  to  teaching  first  grade  math,  she  is  a  Math  Methods  Instructor  at

Middle Tennessee State University.

There  is  no  more  important  job  than  the  one  these  teachers  perform  every  day.
Their  efforts  inspire  the  next  generation  of  scientists,  mathematicians,  and  engi-
neers, who will make the discoveries and create the technological marvels of the fu-
ture.

Today,  the  Science  Committee  has  the  privilege  of  hearing  from  some  of  the  best

math and science teachers in the Nation.

I  hope  to  learn  what  attracted  you  to  teaching  careers  and  the  factors  that  led
to  your  outstanding  success  as  math  and  science  teachers—and  what  it  will  take
to replicate your success and increase your numbers.

I  would  also  appreciate  hearing  about  your  experiences  with  federally  sponsored
teacher professional development programs and activities that resulted in new, and
hopefully improved, teaching materials.

This  is  a  matter  of  particular  interest  to  the  Science  Committee  as  we  con-
template  the  FY  2006  budget  request  for  the  National  Science  Foundation,  which
recommends  substantial  reductions  in  the  programs  that  support  K–12  science  and
math education activities.

I  would  be  interested  in  hearing  about  the  experiences  the  expert  teachers  here
this  morning  have  had  with  NSF-supported  education  programs,  and  what  value
they would place on these programs.

Again,  I  want  to  offer  my  congratulations  to  our  witnesses  on  their  presidential
awards.  I  appreciate  their  attendance  before  the  Committee,  and  I  look  forward  to
our discussion.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to congratulate these teachers who
have  demonstrated  such  excellence  in  their  fields.  You  all  represent  the  future  of
our  nation.  By  teaching  our  children  in  the  basic  skills  of  math  and  science,  you
are sowing the seeds of a competitive workforce.

I’m  sure  that  there  are  Members  of  this  committee  who  can  speak  more  intel-
ligently  about  the  work  you  do,  including  Ms.  Hooley,  the  Ranking  Member  of  the
Research  Subcommittee,  who  is  a  former  teacher.  I  am  looking  forward  to  hearing
more  from  you  about  the  magic  you  work  in  the  classroom,  stirring  interest  in
science and mathematics. I’d like to take this time to talk a little about the future.
A few months ago, I spoke to an executive for General Electric. When I asked him
if he had enough qualified engineers to fill his research jobs, he said ‘‘No.’’ He could
hire  300  tomorrow  if  they  were  available.  He  said  we  need  more  qualified  and  in-
spiring teachers. There just aren’t enough teachers to train the future scientists and
engineers his company needs.

GE is not alone. The Department of Labor estimates that there will be six million
job  openings  for  scientists,  engineers,  and  mathematicians  by  2008.  Sixty  percent
of  new  jobs  will  require  a  solid  mathematical  background.  Think  about  auto  me-
chanics: they need to be able to read graphs, understand timing diagrams, and reset
microprocessors.

But we’re not on a path to fill those six million job openings. We’re only producing
60,000  engineers  per  year,  compared  to  over  half-million  per  year  in  China  and
India.  I  fear  that  our  lack  of  investment  in  science  and  math  education  is  creating
an  innovation  gap  between  our  country  and  emerging  economies.  We  must  not  sit
idly by and slip into obscurity.

That’s  why  I’m  pleased  that  we’re  highlighting  your  work  today.  Your  ability  to
impart  passion  is  a  gift.  We  all  have  a  story  of  how  a  great  teacher  changed  the
way  we  thought,  not  just  about  the  subject  matter,  but  about  the  world.  Those
present  are  acknowledged  as  our  nation’s  greatest  teachers,  and  our  greatest  re-
source  for  reaching  our  children  with  the  message:  math  and  science  are  essential
to your future success.

I’m  eager  to  hear  your  suggestions  of  how  we  can  help  you  do  your  job  better,

and how we can help other teachers become inspirers.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  discuss  elementary  and  secondary  math  and  science  education.  For  years,  the
Science  Committee  has  been  actively  conducting  hearings  on  reform  of  elementary
and  secondary  education  to  better  student  performance  and  has  produced  quality
legislation  to  reverse  a  trend  of  inadequate  interest  and  training  in  the  science,
math,  engineering,  and  technology  fields.  Today’s  hearing  continues  this  effort  and
gives us the opportunity to honor a group of teachers that have been recognized for
their excellence as math and science teachers, and to discuss factors influencing re-
cruitment and retention of math and science teachers.

I  continue  to  be  concerned  that  our  students  are  far  behind  in  math  and  science
issues. Failure to engage more elementary and secondary students in these subjects
has  the  direct  effect  of  decreasing  the  number  of  math  and  science  undergraduates
and,  consequently,  graduate  students.  It  is  important  to  provide  stimulating  and
challenging math and science education programs for all students in order to foster
a leads to the development of a less-informed, less-discriminating citizenry. My wife,
who is the Assistant Superintendent of the Regional Office of Education in St. Clair,
County  Illinois,  often  reminds  me  that  at  the  front  lines  of  any  reform  efforts  are
teachers.  High  teacher  turnover  creates  a  continual  demand  for  new  teachers,  and
those  teachers  require  teacher  professional  education  and  development.  Having  a
qualified  teacher  in  every  classroom  is  a  significant  contributor  to  student  success
and ensuring a superior education.

As Congress debates the Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2006, we must remem-
ber  how  important  and  critical  these  initiatives  are  for  students  to  be  competitive
in math and science nationally and internationally. Each year, we have this hearing
to  bring  us  closer  to  resolving  a  fundamental  problem  that  continues  to  plague  our
education  system.  I  commend  the  Science  Committee’s  commitment  to  improving
teacher  recruitment  and  retention  so  we  can  increase  student  interest  levels  and
their  knowledge  and  understanding  of  these  valuable  subjects,  and  I  welcome  our
panel of witnesses and look forward to their testimony.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

First, I would like to thank the Chair and Ranking Member for calling this hear-
ing.  I  also  want  to  congratulate  the  teachers  who  are  here  before  us  as  witnesses
today on their outstanding accomplishments.

Today,  we  are  here  to  honor  a  group  of  teachers  who  have  received  national  rec-
ognition  for  their  excellence  as  science  and  math  teachers,  and  to  explore  some  of
the  factors  that  influence  the  recruitment,  professional  development  and  retention
of science and math teachers.

It  is  very  important  that  we  meet  to  recognize  the  important  contributions  made
by  these  individuals.  Teachers  improve  the  lives  of  children  and  their  families.
Teachers  also  strive  to  give  voice  to  their  legitimate  professional,  economic  and  so-
cial  aspirations.  They  strengthen  the  institutions  in  which  we  work,  improve  the
quality of the services we provide, bring together all members to assist and support
one  another  and  promote  democracy,  human  rights  and  freedom,  in  our  nation  and
throughout the world.

I believe that education must be our number one national priority. In fact, during
my almost thirty years as a legislator, I have fought to ensure that education is on
top of the legislative agenda.

Without teachers, this nation could not flourish. A skilled workforce is the essen-
tial fuel to propel the economy and ensure a high quality of life. It is absolutely crit-
ical  to  the  success  of  our  nation’s  economy  that  we  continue  to  produce  a  scientif-
ically literate workforce.

It  is  for  teachers,  like  the  ones  who  are  here  today,  that  we  must  re-emphasize
our commitment to education. Now is the time to increase education spending. Edu-
cation  is  not  a  luxury  item  that  can  be  trimmed  when  more  enticing  budget  items
beckon. It is an essential element that should be our highest national priority.

It  is  time  to  take  action  to  ensure  the  best  possible  education  for  our  children.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LINCOLN DAVIS

Congratulations  to  all  of  the  recipients  of  the  2004  Presidential  Award  for  Excel-
lence  in  Mathematics  and  Science  Teaching.  This  award  is  the  Nation’s  highest
prize for K–12 math and science educators.

Math and science education is important for the prosperity and international com-
petitiveness  of  our  nation.  Our  ability  to  develop  faster  computers,  better  research
tools,  more  sensitive  medical  diagnostic  equipment,  and  more  fuel-efficient  engines
depend on what we do now to produce future scientists and engineers. We must fos-
ter a creative spirit and love of math and science in kids today.

The  work  of  teachers  everywhere  inspires  these  future  generations.  Great  edu-
cators,  such  as  those  being  honored  here  today,  are  planting  seeds  in  the  minds  of
bright, curious, young students. These teachers’ days are long, their charge is great,
but their influence is powerful.

In Tennessee, two teachers were selected for this highest honor in K–12 math and
science education. One of them, Ms. Beverly Ramsey, is from Viola, Tennessee, and
teaches  at  West  Elementary  School  in  McMinnville.  I  would  like  to  extend  special
congratulations  to  her.  I  am  certain  that  Ms.  Ramsey’s  energy  and  love  of  science
are infectious in her classroom and have inspired many young scientists.

I commend the important work that all of you are doing and am grateful for this

forum to recognize you today.

ing today.

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for holding this positive hear-

I am pleased to welcome our exemplary panelists and awardees, Joyce Dodd, Cyn-
thia  Cliche,  Lonna  Sanderson,  Cassandra  Barnes,  and  Pita  Martinez-McDonald.
Also,  I  want  to  give  special  recognition  to  the  two  awardees  from  my  home  State
of Missouri, Russell Gramer and Gail Underwood.

Thank you for agreeing to speak to the Science Committee today, and more impor-
tantly,  thank  you  for  your  hard  work  and  outstanding  commitment  to  serving  our
nation’s children.

Clearly,  our  nation  experiences  setbacks  in  recruitment  of  teachers  in  mathe-
matics  and  science  as  well  as  declining  student  performance  in  the  same  subject
areas.  Today’s  testimony  is  a  breath  of  fresh  air  at  a  time  when  we  find  no  simple
solutions to either of these problems.

Please know that this body is committed to finding the policy solutions best suited
to  improve  student  performance  in  math  and  science.  We  have  much  to  learn  from
all of you and I look forward to your testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  important  hearing  with  these  teachers
who  exemplify  all  that  is  right  with  our  nation.  Truly,  teachers  are  among  the
Americans  who  give  the  most  and  ask  for  the  least  in  return.  They  are  true  public
servants  and  it  is  on  their  shoulders  that  our  hopes  as  a  nation  really  rest.  It  was
the  great  educator  and  civil  rights  leader  Mary  McLeod  Bethune  who  said:  ‘‘We
have  a  powerful  potential  in  our  youth,  and  we  must  have  the  courage  to  change
old ideas and practices so that we may direct their power toward good ends.’’ Clear-
ly, the young students we teach today will be the leaders of industry that our nation
will depend on in the not too distant future.

Let  me  congratulate  all  the  2004  Presidential  Awardees  for  Excellence  in  Mathe-
matics  and  Science  Teaching.  Let  me  especially  congratulate  my  fellow  Texans  in
the  room:  Ms.  Lonna  Sanderson  from  Austin,  TX  and  Ms.  Kathy  Skinner  from
Grapevine,  TX,  both  of  you  have  made  the  great  State  of  Texas  proud  with  your
achievement.  All  the  Members  of  this  committee  will  agree  that  Math  and  Science
are  two  subjects  we  simply  can  not  ignore  in  our  youth.  Our  nation  has  declined
over the years in these vital subject areas and it is to our long-term detriment. Our
nation  has  been  known  throughout  the  world  as  one  of  innovation  and  discovery,
however  we  may  not  be  able  to  hold  this  distinction  unless  we  can  continue  to  in-
spire our youth to push the boundaries of what is possible.

I  am  especially  concerned  about  the  issue  of  minorities  in  math  and  science.  Mi-
norities  are  under-represented  at  every  level  from  elementary  to  graduate  school.
Lack  of  preparation  in  science  among  under-represented  minority  groups  in  the
early  elementary  grades  undermines  enrollment  and  success  in  secondary-level
school  programs  and,  ultimately,  in  college  and  career  choices  later  in  life.  In  fact,
To achieve ‘‘parity’’—minorities in engineering comparable to their representation in
the general population—we would have to produce by 2010 an average of 25,000 per
year. Today, universities graduate just over one-third that number.

As the Nation’s economic base shifts increasingly toward technology, participation
and  achievement  in  science  and  mathematics  among  minority  students  become  in-
creasingly  important.  Unfortunately,  minority  students,  those  who  form  the  most
rapidly growing portion of our school-age population, are the ones that are most left
out  of  science  and  mathematics.  By  not  studying  these  subjects,  both  the  minority
students and the United States as a whole stand to lose. The minority students are
depriving  themselves  of  many  career  choices,  including  the  skilled  technical  and
computer-oriented  occupations  as  well  as  access  to  high  salaried  occupations.  Fur-
ther, a basic understanding of science and mathematics is essential for all students,
not only those pursuing careers in scientific and technical fields. Adequate prepara-
tion  in  science  and  mathematics  enables  students  to  develop  intellectually  and  so-
cially,  and  participate  fully  in  a  technological  society  as  informed  citizens.  The
United  States  can  meet  future  potential  shortfalls  of  scientists  and  engineers  only
by  reaching  out  and  bringing  members  of  under-represented  minorities  into  science
and engineering. America’s standing and competitiveness depend on it.

Truly,  the  areas  of  math  and  science  are  essential  to  our  youth  as  well  as  to  the
health of our nation. Young Americans will be the future leaders and innovators not
only  for  our  nation,  but  for  the  world.  It  was  author  Luella  F.  Phean  who  stated:
‘‘Youth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind. You are as old as your doubt, your
fear,  your  despair.  The  way  to  keep  young  is  to  keep  your  faith  young.  Keep  your
self-confidence  young.  Keep  your  hope  young.’’  I  am  confident  that  all  the  teachers
we  have  here  today  give  that  spirit  of  encouragement  to  all  their  students  and  our
nation will only be richer for it.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Matheson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JIM MATHESON

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  partici-
pate  in  today’s  hearing.  The  quality  of  math  and  science  education  in  our  country
is an important consideration, and one of the best tools that we have in making im-
provements is the examination of current, successful classroom teachers.

In  that  vein,  I  wanted  to  briefly  recognize  two  of  my  constituents,  both  of  whom
are  2004  Presidential  Awardees  for  Excellence  in  Mathematics  and  Science  Teach-
ing.

Ms.  Carol  Skousen  is  a  teacher  at  Twin  Peaks  Elementary  School  in  Holladay,
Utah.  She  is  noted  for  being  an  excellent  classroom  teacher.  The  principal  of  her
school  notes  that  she  demonstrates  concern  for  each  individual  child,  ‘‘sensitivity
with which she listens and (concern) in responding to inquiring minds.’’

The  second  individual  is  Ms.  Jennifer  Buttars.  She  teaches  in  the  Jordan  School

District in Utah and she was awarded the mathematics prize for our state.

Both of these teachers exemplify the excellence in education that should serve as
a  model  for  our  school  system.  They  have  devoted  considerable  time  to  improving
their  classrooms  and  ensuring  that  their  students  truly  benefit  from  their  energy
and devotion to this profession.

I am very pleased that both Ms. Skousen and Ms. Buttars are here today for this

important hearing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Our witness list is very distinguished.
Joyce  Dodd  teaches  sixth  grade  mathematics  at  Bryson  Middle
School  in  Simpsonville,  South  Carolina.  Ms.  Dodd  has  more  than
30 years of teaching experience. You have already been introduced
to  Cynthia  Cliche  who  teaches  first  grade  mathematics,  and  had
the  good  judgment  to  go  to  Mr.  Gordon’s  alma  mater,  at  Homer
Pittard  Campus  School  in  Murfreesboro,  Tennessee.  Ms.  Cliche  is
also  a  college-level  Math  Methods  instructor  for  Middle  Tennessee
State  University.  She  has  more  than  20  years  of  teaching  experi-
ence.  Cassandra  Barnes  teaches—oh,  now  wait.  I  am  not  going  to

every day.

introduce  you,  Ms.  Barnes.  I  am  going  to  yield  to  Congresswoman
Hooley for an introduction.

Ms. HOOLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  again,  congratulations  to  all  of  you  and  for  what  you  do

Ms. Barnes teaches grade school in Clackamas County, my home
county,  and  it  is  wonderful  what  she  does  and  that  you  are  with
us today. Thank you for being here. As technology continues to ad-
vance and improve at our workplace, it places more stress on math
and  science.  Ms.  Barnes  inspires  her  students  every  single  day  in
math  and  science.  And  it  is  really  important  because  so  much  of
that  is  the  future  of  our  country.  It  is  the  foundation  of  our  new
jobs, and so we are delighted that you are with us today.

And again, congratulations to all of you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And for the purpose of an introduction, the Chair recognizes Mr.

McCaul of Texas.

Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, I want to congratulate all five of you. In my view, you have
the  most  important  job  in  the  world.  You  are  the  educators  that
shape  the  future  of  America,  and  I  want  to  thank  all  five  of  you
for that.

It is my honor to introduce to you Lonna Sanderson. She is from
Texas,  my  home  state,  and  she  is  from  my  hometown  of  Austin.
She is also, more importantly, a constituent of mine, and I probably
shouldn’t  say  this,  but  she  did  vote  for  me,  which  I  was  glad  to
hear backstage. And I had—unlike the Ranking Member, I had ev-
erything to do with her nomination.

Just kidding.
She  is  a  third  grade  teacher  at  Will  Davis  Elementary  School  in
Austin  independent  school  district.  She  is  in  her  fifth  year  at  Will
Davis,  but  she  has  been  an  elementary  school  teacher  in  Austin
independent  school  district  for  25  years.  In  2000,  Ms.  Sanderson
was  recognized  as  a  national  board-certified  teacher,  an  achieve-
ment  she  considered  the  high  point  of  her  career  until  now,  when
now  she  is  receiving  the  Presidential  Award  for  Excellence  in
Science and Mathematics Teaching. Ms. Sanderson is a person who
is  capable  of  great  accomplishments.  And  this  is  just  what  she  is
achieving  by  giving  Texas’  young  students  a  world-class  education
in  math  and  science,  an  achievement  we  need  more  of  in  this  Na-
tion  to  cultivate  and  raise  more  scientists  and  engineers  in  this
country,  more  home  grown.  I  wish  that  every  math  and  science
teacher could be as gifted as Ms. Sanderson and the rest of the re-
cipients  of  this  great  honor  from  President  Bush.  For  innovative
use  of  technology  in  the  classroom  is  truly  a  model  for  the  Nation.
Mr.  Chairman,  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  the
Science Committee to find ways to address America’s teacher short-
age  and  to  keep  kids  excited  about  the  great  possibilities  of  math
and science academics.

And  I  would  like  to  end  with  a  quote  that  appears  behind  me,
because  I  think  it  says  everything  about  your  profession:  ‘‘For  I
dipped  into  the  future  as  far  as  human  eyes  could  see  and  the  vi-
sion  of  the  world  and  all  of  the  wonder  that  would  be.’’  That  is

what  you  provide  for  the  youth  in  the  United  States  and  in  Amer-
ica, and I thank you for it.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you. And eloquently said.
And  our  final  witness  is  Pita  Martinez-McDonald.  She  teaches
fourth  grade  science  at  Cuba  Elementary  School  in  Cuba,  New
Mexico. She has been a teacher for 30 years.

Just  let  me  tell  you  one  of  the  great  challenges  that  we  face  in
our  jobs  here,  challenge  us  every  single  day,  you  know  them  all,
but  one  of  the  greatest  challenges  I  faced  was  three  weeks  ago
when I was going to go out and have dinner with my eldest daugh-
ter  who  lives  in  suburban  Virginia.  And  she  said,  ‘‘Dad,  do  you
mind spending a little extra time, because I want you to help Palm-
er,’’  that  is  my  13-year-old  grandson,  ‘‘with  his  homework?’’  And
boy,  I  started  to  sweat  immediately.  I  was  afraid  it  was  going  to
be math or something where I am—as it turned out, we had a very
pleasant  evening,  because  his  assignment  was  to  develop  a  bill  to
introduce  before  Congress  and  convince  his  classmates  that  it
should  pass.  And  so  that  made  the  challenge  a  little  easier.  But
boy,  I  was  almost  ready  to  get  my  Rolodex  out  and  start  calling
you,  Ms.  Martinez-McDonald.  But  thank  you  very  much  for  being
here and for being facilitators for this committee.

What  we  will  do  is  include  your  entire  statement  in  the  record
at  this  juncture,  or  as  you  complete  your  summary  of  the  state-
ment.  We  would  ask  that  you  summarize  your  statement.  The
Chair  is  not  going  to  be  arbitrary,  but  we  shoot  for,  whether  it  is
outstanding  teachers  or  Cabinet  officers,  we  ask  for  a  summary  of
five  to  six  minutes  or  so,  and  that  allows  more  time  for  us  to  give
questions.

But before we do anything, just let me say on behalf of the whole
Committee, and I would ask that you join me in a standing ovation
for you, our nation’s best.

Just let me tell you something. We don’t start all of our hearings

with standing ovations for the witness panel.

Ms. Dodd, you are up first.

STATEMENT OF MS. JOYCE W. DODD, BRYSON MIDDLE

SCHOOL, SIMPSONVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA

Ms. DODD. Thank you.
It is indeed my honor to address this committee today and a very
humbling  experience  to  speak  on  behalf  of  my  colleagues.  The  sin-
gle  most  important  step  that  I  think  the  Federal  Government
should take to improve math and science education in this country
involves  steps  taken  to  improve  pre-service  and  in-service  training
for  the  teachers  of  mathematics  in  elementary  and  middle  schools.
When  math  teachers  in  these  classrooms  do  not  have  a  strong
background in mathematics, that deficit will definitely impact both
the content and the process of what they are teaching, the how and
the what.

I  am  one  of  these  teachers  who  found  herself  teaching  mathe-
matics  in  a  middle  school  by  walking  in  the  door  with  an  elemen-
tary education certificate. My job as a home economics teacher was
phased  out  due  to  budget  cuts.  I  was  determined  to  become  the
best math teacher that I could be. I took stock of the situation, and

16

I  knew  that  I  was  a  good  teacher.  I  called  a  friend  of  mine  who
happened to be the district math coordinator, and I asked her how
could I fast track my knowledge in mathematics. She gave me two
pieces of advice, which I followed.

The  first  piece  of  advice  was  to  join  the  National  Council  of
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). That organization produces high
quality  teaching  materials.  It  publishes  a  magazine  that  connects
math  teachers  with  the  best  practices  and  the  best  math  teachers
in  the  country.  It  is  the  organization  that  changes  the  direction  of
the way math is taught in America. Mathematics is a science, and
as such, it is a growing, evolving discipline.

The math content that I teach my sixth graders needs to prepare
them for life in the future. This shift in math content is often mis-
understood  by  many  people,  including  math  teachers.  Math  is  so
much  more  than  adding  two  plus  two  and  getting  four  or  teaching
a  child  to  struggle  through  division  of  two  digits  into  three-digit
numbers.  Those  are  operations,  and  they  can  easily  be  done  on  a
calculator. You can get that at any Wal-Mart for less than $10. My
job  is  to  put  the  power  behind  the  calculator  and  help  that  child
reason, ‘‘Is the answer correct? Does it make sense?’’

NCTM also sponsors top quality educational programs for teach-
ers. I have benefited from these programs. I participated in a four-
day  seminar  called  ‘‘T3,’’  teachers  teaching  teachers  technology.
This  course  enabled  me  to  become  proficient  using  a  graphing  cal-
culator.  I  would  suggest  that  this  course  is  an  excellent  course  as
a  model  for  NSF  to  fund  programs  such  as  this.  The  carrot  for  me
was,  of  course,  learning  to  be  proficient  with  the  graphing  calcu-
lator,  but  even  more  importantly,  I  got  a  free  graphing  calculator.
Teachers will work for free stuff. What an incentive.

The  second  piece  of  advice  that  my  friend  gave  me  was  to  take
as many math content classes as I could. Now I was extremely for-
tunate.  At  the  time,  the  place  that  I  was  working,  which  was
Greenville,  South  Carolina,  our  district  had  the  foresight  and  it
took the funding to finance courses for middle school teachers who
lacked  secondary  certification  in  mathematics  to  take  higher  level
math  classes.  Not  every  teacher  in  the  country  can  be  that  fortu-
nate.

These were especially valuable courses, because they were taught
using  best  practices.  That  meant  that  my  college  professor,  Dr.
Celia Adair, was teaching me as an active learner. That meant that
I  had  an  opportunity  to  use  technology  to  discover  answers.  I  was
making sense of mathematics myself. I could think back to the way
Celia taught our class to make model lessons for my own students,
because  we  all  tend  to  teach  the  way  we  were  taught.  So  if  we
want  teachers  to  be  able  to  teach  children  actively,  we  need  to  let
those teachers experience learning from that standpoint.

In  closing,  I  would  again  reiterate  that  probably  the  best  use  of
federal  funds  is  to  sponsor  in-service  training  for  the  teachers  we
already have in the classroom and, just as importantly, pre-service
teachers. We know what makes good learners. We know they need
to  be  active.  We  need  to  expect  our  higher  education  institutions
to  be  turning  out  teachers  that  can  teach  children  using  active
learning strategies.

Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Dodd follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOYCE W. DODD

It  is  indeed  an  honor  to  address  this  committee  and  a  humbling  experience  to
speak  on  behalf  of  my  colleagues  today.  The  single  most  important  step  that  the
Federal  Government  should  take  to  improve  math  and  science  education  in  this
country is to improve pre-service and in-service training for teachers of mathematics
in  elementary  and  middle  schools.  When  math  teachers  in  these  classrooms  do  not
have a strong background in mathematics, that deficit impacts both the content and
the process (the ‘‘what’’ and the ‘‘how’’) of their teaching.

I  am  one  of  these  teachers  who  found  herself  teaching  mathematics  in  a  middle
school  classroom  using  an  elementary  teaching  certificate.  My  job  in  home  econom-
ics  was  phased  out  due  to  budget  cuts;  I  was  determined  to  become  the  best  math
teacher that I could become. Taking stock of the situation, I knew that I was a good
teacher.  I  called  the  district  math  consultant,  who  was  a  former  colleague,  to  seek
guidance as to how to ‘‘fast track’’ my own math education. She gave me two pieces
of advice, which I followed.

The  first  piece  of  advice  was  to  join  the  National  Council  of  Teachers  of  Mathe-
matics.  This  organization  produces  high  quality  teaching  materials  and  publishes  a
magazine that connects math teachers with other math teachers. It is the organiza-
tion that helped change the direction of the teaching of mathematics in this country.
Mathematics is a science, and like any other science, it is growing and evolving.

The math content that I teach needs to prepare my students for life in the future.
The  shift  in  math  content  is  misunderstood  by  many  people,  including  math  edu-
cators.  Math  is  so  much  more  than  adding  2  +  2  or  dividing  a  three  digit  number
by  a  two  digit  number.  These  operations  can  be  easily  done  with  a  calculator.  The
key  to  using  this  technology,  which  came  be  purchased  at  Wal-Mart  for  under  $10,
is to know if the resulting answer is reasonable, i.e., ‘‘Does it make sense?’’

At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  briefly  explain  the  mathematics  standards  that,  I
believe, should be pervasive in elementary, middle and high schools throughout this
country.  Five  categories  form  the  content  area  of  mathematics:  numbers  and  oper-
ations,  algebra,  geometry,  measurement  and  data  analysis,  and  statistics.  What
makes these standards ‘‘come alive’’ and give meaning to students is the incorpora-
tion of the process standards. These standards include problem solving, representa-
tion, communication, connections, and reasoning and proofs.

In  order  to  incorporate  the  process  standards  students  need  to  be  ‘‘actively  en-
gaged’’  in  math.  Active  learning  has  students  solving  problems  and  discussing  solu-
tions. Students are able to justify their work to one another and to the teacher.

I  challenge  my  students  who  want  to  become  better  at  math  to  do  what  the
NCTM  logo  suggests,  ‘‘Do  Math.’’  It  is  my  job  as  their  teacher  to  create  situations
where this happens.

NCTM  also  sponsors  courses  for  teachers  through  various  grants.  I  attended  one
such  course  taught  in  our  district,  T3.  This  acronym  stands  for  teachers  teaching
technology. This course enabled me to become proficient with a graphing calculator.
I would suggest that NSF could use this as a model for funding courses for teachers.
The  teacher  that  attends  these  courses  receives  free  technology—in  my  case  a  free
graphing calculator—that can be incorporated in her classroom. What an incentive!
The second piece of advice was to take as many courses in mathematics as I could.
I  was  fortunate  to  be  in  a  district  that  had  an  initiative  to  improve  the  content
knowledge of mathematics teachers in the middle school who lacked a degree in sec-
ondary  mathematics  education.  Not  all  teachers  work  in  a  district  that  gives  this
much  foresight  and  financial  support  to  mathematics  education.  This  is  where  the
Federal Government could sponsor teacher education courses.

These  were  especially  valuable  courses  because  the  courses  were  taught  with  the
use of ‘‘hands on’’ lessons that integrated technology in each lesson. The college pro-
fessor in these classes was modeling the way that I should develop my own lessons.
These  courses  also  made  connections  within  the  field  of  mathematics.  I  could  ‘‘see’’
the  way  math  should  be  taught.  My  college  professor  was  the  model  that  I  could
duplicate  in  my  classes.  I  think  it  is  extremely  important  to  have  teachers  view
other teachers that are actively engaging students in learning. We all tend to teach
the  way  we  were  taught.  The  implication  here  is  that  teacher  preparation  classes
as well as teacher in-services should employ the teaching practices we desire teach-
ers to use in their classrooms.

In  closing,  I  would  like  to  say  that  the  knowledge  for  improving  math  education
in this country already exists. However, there is a gap in the dispersal of this infor-
mation.  Programs  that  foster  ‘‘best  teaching’’  practices  will  have  children  actively
engaged  in  mathematics.  The  Federal  Government  could  be  on  the  forefront  of  this

dispersal of information by sponsoring courses for the teachers of mathematics. The
rewards for participation in these courses could take the form of stipends, graduate
credit or free equipment for the classroom. A single teacher of mathematics will in-
fluence  an  astonishing  number  of  students.  The  profit  from  this  investment  would
be astronomical!

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. Cliche.

STATEMENT OF MS. CYNTHIA L. CLICHE, HOMER PITTARD

CAMPUS SCHOOL, MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE

Ms. CLICHE. Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak
before  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  Committee  of  Science.
Special  thanks  goes  to  Chairman  Sherwood  Boehlert  for  his  sup-
port  and  Ranking  Member  Bart  Gordon,  my  Representative  from
Tennessee. This is such an honor, and I appreciate this committee’s
efforts in giving teachers time to discuss topics which are so impor-
tant to our children’s future.

As  you  have  heard,  Campus  School  is  a  unique  school  in
Murfreesboro, because we are the lab school with Middle Tennessee
State University, so it allows me the opportunity to teach the Math
Methods course and work with pre-service teachers.

Our  students  benefit  from  the  involvement  of  the  pre-service
teachers,  but  also  in  turn,  the  pre-service  teachers  benefit  from
working  with  our  students.  For  instance,  several  years  ago,  my
class,  working  with  the  biology  department,  five  pre-service  teach-
ers, and parents built an outdoor pond and butterfly garden to en-
rich  our  first  grade  curriculum.  The  next  year,  several  EFG,  Edu-
cating  Future  Generation,  teachers,  including  myself,  built  an  ex-
tensive  nature  trail  with  many  more  gardens  and  features  around
the  school.  This  trail  provides  many  opportunities  to  develop
hands-on math and science lessons outside the classroom. It is this

type of activity that can incorporate the National Council of Teach-
ers  of  Mathematics,  NCTM,  principles  for  education  and  learning.
I  believe  the  six  NCTM  principles:  equity,  curriculum,  teaching,
learning,  assessment,  and  technology  provide  a  solid  mathematical
foundation  for  all  students,  and  they  should  be  emphasized,  fund-
ed, and applied in every classroom in the United States.

Equity  sets  high  expectations  for  all  students,  regardless  of  gen-
der, race, and ability. Every child needs to be given the opportunity
to  learn.  Sometimes  so  much  emphasis  is  given  to  the  lowest
achievers that other children are allowed to plateau in their learn-
ing.  Teachers  need  to  provide  enrichment  opportunities  for  our
higher ability students while implementing the remedial strategies
for  our  struggling  students.  We  should  never  give  up  on  any  stu-
dent.

The  mathematics  curriculum  needs  to  focus  on  the  five  content
standards:  numbers  and  operations,  geometry,  data  analysis  and
probability,  measurements,  and  algebra.  These  standards  provide
the content for mathematical teaching. In addition, lessons need to
be  hands-on  and  provide  the  opportunity  for  meaningful  learning.
Too  many  teachers  use  only  a  textbook  in  their  elementary  class-
rooms  because  the  administration  feels  it  is  the  easiest  and  most
effective  way  to  teach  children.  Years  of  research  and  experience,
however,  show  that  this  is  simply  not  true.  Students  need  to  use
manipulatives  and  problem-solving  techniques  to  encourage  active
learning.  Look  into  an  effective  teacher’s  classroom  and  the  chil-
dren are engaged, talking, and learning. Long gone are the days of
ditto papers and everyone sitting quietly at their desk.

Teaching  requires  educators  to  understand  what  students  know
and  how  to  challenge  them  to  learn  it  well.  Every  child  deserves
a great teacher, and a great teacher teaches the whole child. In ad-
dition,  great  teachers  increase  their  learning  of  mathematics  and
improve  their  ability  to  implement  an  effective  curriculum  in  their
classroom.  They  can  do  this  by  learning  from  students  and  col-
leagues  and  engaging  in  professional  development  and  self-reflec-
tion.  NCTM,  as  well  as  other  national  organizations,  provide  re-
gional and national conferences to help achieve that goal. Often, it
is  extremely  difficult  for  teachers  to  obtain  funding  to  attend  the
professional  conferences  that  keep  them  up-to-date  with  current
teaching  practices.  Professional  development  needs  to  be  encour-
aged  and  funded  for  all  teachers.  After  25  years  of  teaching,  it  is
apparent  to  me  that  there  is  still  so  much  more  to  learn.  Our
teachers, like our children, should be lifelong learners.

Emphasis also needs to be placed on creating a positive work en-
vironment  for  teachers.  If  a  teacher  feels  appreciated  and  empow-
ered to make decisions in his or her classroom, it will positively af-
fect student achievement.

At the same time, we need to make the teaching profession more
attractive  to  our  top  students.  As  a  university  math  methods  in-
structor  for  the  past  15  years,  I  have  seen  the  quality  of  teacher
candidates  decline.  Teachers  are  being  hired  that  would  not  have
been  given  an  interview  10  years  ago,  and  our  brightest  young
adults are choosing careers with higher salaries and more benefits.
My own niece wanted to be a teacher and this year, upon entering

high school, decided to go into the business field simply because of
the salary and the time commitment.

Learning requires students to truly understand mathematics and
to actively build knowledge from new and prior experiences. Mate-
rials and supports are key to active learning, and our focus should
be  on  understanding  as  well  as  procedural  skills.  Some  of  my
proudest  moments  are  when  my  students  return  to  visit  the  class-
room.  They  always  remark  about  the  physical  features  such  as  it
looks  smaller  or  have  you  moved  your  desk.  But  then  they  always
talk about a special activity that took place. It might be the ‘‘Meas-
ure  Me’’  doll  that  they  have  made  that  was  the  same  birth  weight
as  they  were  or  the  tree  that  they  planted  along  the  trail.  Active
learning enables a child to develop a concept in a meaningful way.
Assessments  should  support  the  learning  of  important  mathe-
matics  and  furnish  useful  information  to  both  teachers  and  stu-
dents.  Assessment  should  be  ongoing  throughout  the  school  year
and  teachers  should  be  using  various  forms  of  evaluation.  A  lot  of
attention  and  funding  is  focused  on  standardized  pencil  and  paper
tests  given  once  a  year,  but  teachers  need  to  use  a  variety  of  tools
such as journals, portfolios, and interview to learn about their stu-
dents.

Finally,  technology  is  an  essential  tool  in  teaching  and  learning
mathematics.  Our  children  need  to  leave  our  classroom  technology
literate.  In  fact,  even  my  first  graders  have  their  calculators  in
their desks ready to tackle the ‘‘big numbers’’ that occur when they
are  solving  some  higher  level  thinking  problems.  They  also  have
several  opportunities  during  the  day  to  go  online  and  work  on
websites bookmarked to enhance their learning of mathematics. So
many schools lack the funds to give their students this opportunity.
As  lawmakers,  the  decisions  you  make  will  impact  the  future  of
our children. Thanks so much for your continued dedication in this
area. With the challenges our nation faces today, we need talented,
well-educated  children  with  the  ability  to  solve  the  problems  of  to-
morrow.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CYNTHIA L. CLICHE

Thank  you  for  allowing  me  this  opportunity  to  speak  before  the  U.S.  House  of
Representatives  Committee  of  Science.  Special  thanks  go  to  Chairman  Sherwood
Boehlert for his support and Ranking Member Bart Gordon, my Representative from
Tennessee. This is such an honor and I appreciate this committee’s efforts in giving
teachers time to discuss topics which are so important to our children’s future.

My  name  is  Cindy  Cliche,  and  I  teach  first  grade  at  Homer  Pittard  Campus
School in Murfreesboro, TN. Campus School is the laboratory school for Middle Ten-
nessee  State  University,  and  it  allows  me  the  unique  opportunity  to  teach  a  math
methods course and to work with pre-service teachers.

Our  students  benefit  from  the  involvement  of  the  pre-service  teachers,  and  they,
in  turn,  benefit  by  working  with  our  children.  For  instance,  several  years  ago  my
class,  working  with  the  Biology  Department,  five  pre-service  teachers,  and  parents,
built  an  outdoor  pond  and  butterfly  garden  to  enhance  our  curriculum.  The  next
year several EFG (Educating Future Generation) teachers including myself built an
extensive nature trail with many more gardens and features around the school. This
trail provides many opportunities to develop hands-on math and science lessons out-
side the classroom. It is this type of activity that can incorporate the National Coun-
cil of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) principles for education and learning.

ment and technology—provide a solid mathematical foundation for all students, and

they  should  be  emphasized,  funded  and  applied  in  every  classroom  in  the  United
States.

Equity sets high expectations for all students, regardless of gender, race, and abil-
ity. Every child needs to be given the opportunity to learn. Sometimes, so much em-
phasis  is  given  to  the  lowest  achievers  that  other  children  are  allowed  to  plateau
in their learning. Teachers need to provide enrichment opportunities for our higher
ability  students  and  implementing  remedial  strategies  for  our  struggling  students.
We should never give up on any student!

The  mathematics  curriculum  needs  to  focus  on  the  five  content  standards:  num-
bers and operations, geometry, data analysis and probability, measurement, and al-
gebra.  These  standards  provide  the  content  for  mathematical  teaching.  In  addition,
lessons need to be ‘‘hands on’’ and provide the opportunity for meaningful learning.
Too  many  teachers  use  only  a  textbook  in  their  elementary  classrooms  because  the

talking and learning. Long gone are the days of ditto papers and every child sitting

Teaching requires educators to understand what students know and how to chal-
lenge them to learn it well. Every child deserves a great teacher and a great teacher
teaches the whole child. In addition, great teachers increase their learning of mathe-
matics and improve their ability to implement an effective curriculum in their class-
room.  They  can  do  this  by  learning  from  students  and  colleagues  and  engaging  in
professional development and self-reflection. NCTM, as well as other national orga-
nizations,  provides  regional  and  national  conferences  to  help  achieve  that  goal.
Often,  it  is  extremely  difficult  for  teachers  to  obtain  funding  to  attend  the  profes-
sional  conferences  that  keep  them  up-to-date  with  current  teaching  practices.  Pro-
fessional  development  needs  to  be  encouraged  and  funded  for  all  teachers.  After
twenty  five  years  of  teaching,  it  is  apparent  to  me  that  there  is  still  so  much  to
learn. Our teachers, like our children, should be life long learners.

Emphasis  also  needs  to  be  placed  on  creating  a  positive  work  environment  for
teachers. If a teacher feels appreciated and empowered to make decisions in his/her
classroom, it will positively affect student achievement.

At the same time we need to make the teaching profession more attractive to our
top  students.  As  a  university  math  methods  instructor  for  the  past  fifteen  years,  I
have  seen  the  quality  of  teacher  candidates  decline.  Teachers  are  being  hired  that
would  not  have  been  given  an  interview  ten  years  ago,  and  our  brightest  young
adults  are  choosing  careers  with  higher  salaries  and  more  benefits.  My  own  niece
wanted  to  be  a  teacher  until  she  became  a  senior  in  high  school.  Now  she  intends
to  go  into  business  so  she  can  make  a  bigger  salary.  Young  people  want  to  be  able
to justify the cost of an education with the potential salary. As more of my teaching
colleagues  begin  to  look  at  retirement,  this  concern  over  the  lack  of  quality,  com-
mitted teachers becomes alarming.

Learning requires students to truly understand mathematics and to actively build
knowledge from new and prior experiences. Materials and support are key to active
learning,  and  our  focus  should  be  on  understanding  as  well  as  procedural  skills.
Some of my proudest moments are when my students return to visit the classroom.
They  will  remark  about  the  physical  features,  such  as:  how  the  room  looks  smaller
or  have  you  moved  your  desk.  Then  they  always  reminisce  about  a  special  activity.
It  might  be  the  ‘‘Measure  Me’’  doll  that  they  made  which  was  their  exact  birth
weight  or  the  tree  they  planted  along  the  nature  trail.  Active  learning  enables  a
child to develop a concept in a meaningful way.

Assessments  should  support  the  learning  of  important  mathematics  and  furnish
useful  information  to  both  teachers  and  students.  Assessment  should  be  ongoing
throughout  the  school  year  and  teachers  should  be  using  various  forms  of  evalua-

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much. Are you still teach-

ing the times tables?

Ms. Barnes.
STATEMENT OF MS. CASSANDRA BARNES, OREGON TRAIL

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CLACKAMAS, OREGON

Ms. BARNES. Good morning. I would like to take this opportunity
to speak to you about what has made a difference in my continued
professional development as a teacher, which, in turn, makes a dif-
ference for my students.

When I began teaching, an experienced colleague and I attended
a typical one-day workshop designed to give teachers ideas to take
back  to  their  classrooms.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  I  was  bored  stiff,
and  I  regretted  the  $200  I  had  spent  to  attend  the  conference.  I
complained  to  my  colleague,  who  responded,  ‘‘Well,  I  figure  if  I
walk away with one good idea to take back to the classroom, it was
worth  it.’’  And  I  thought  about  that,  and  honestly,  at  first,  I
thought,  ‘‘Oh,  well,  okay.  I  didn’t  realize  that  was  the  way  it
worked.  You  are  just  supposed  to  take  one  little  thing  back.’’  And
the  more  I  thought  about  it,  the  less  sense  it  made,  because  I
thought, ‘‘Would it be reasonable for me to teach an entire day with
the goal of one tiny thing making sense to children?’’ No. And addi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:20 May 31, 2005 Jkt 020424 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\041405\20424.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

tionally,  the  format  of  the  presentation,  such  as  the  one  I  had  at-
tended,  didn’t  fit  with  what  I  believe  about  how  we  learn.  Most  of
these one-day workshops consist of ‘‘expert’’ teachers telling us how
they  do  what  they  do,  and  we  are  just  supposed  to  go  do  it.  And
as  attendees,  we  weren’t  required  to  think  or  discuss  or  apply  any
of the content. I was definitely not an engaged learner.

So  12  years,  and  numerous  professional  development  opportuni-
ties  later,  I  consider  myself  to  be  more  of  an  informed  consumer.
I  now  have  high  expectations  of  my  continuing  education
coursework.  I  expect  professional  development  opportunities  to
challenge my thinking, to require me to reflect deeply on my prac-
tice,  and  above  all,  result  in  improved  learning  for  my  students.
These things don’t happen in a fun, easy, six-hour workshop.

Effective  professional  development  for  teachers,  much  like  deep
learning of content for school children, takes time. It must be long-
term with opportunities to apply new learning in the classroom and
then reflect on the impact with colleagues. It involves planning, im-
plementing,  and  reflecting  on  student  outcomes  with  our  peers,
asking  ourselves  and  each  other  hard  questions  like,  ‘‘Why  didn’t
that  work?  What  do  I  need  to  change?  What  student-based  evi-
dence can I use as data to support my conclusions?’’

For  elementary  math  teachers,  professional  development  might
be  additional  college-level  course  work  in  mathematics,  taught  by
professors  implementing  teaching  practices,  such  as  those  outlined
by  the  National  Council  of  Teachers  of  Mathematics.  Many  of  us
were taught mathematics in much the same way as the early work-
shops I attended were taught. An expert, the teacher, told us what
and how to think, and we were supposed to do that and think that
way.  And  many  teachers  are  now  aware  that  we  need  to  relearn
mathematics  the  way  our  students  are  learning  mathematics,  con-
structing  models,  testing  conjectures,  discussing  our  ideas.  Deep-
ening  our  own  understanding  of  the  mathematics  we  teach  will
allow us to better meet the needs of our students.

Supporting  the  professional  development  of  pre-service  and  in-
service  teachers  is  crucial.  I  believe  in  high  standards  for  all  stu-
dents.  I  believe  all  children  can  learn  mathematics  with  under-
standing.  I  believe  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  funded,
standards-based  curricula  are  improving  math  education  for  stu-
dents  across  the  country.  However,  I  know  that  the  difference  for
kids  lies  in  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  teachers  who  implement
the  curricula  and  standards.  If  the  Federal  Government  wants  to
take steps to improve math and science education for our children,
they  need  to  focus  energy  and  resources  on  providing  high  quality
professional development for our teachers.

In  addition  to  participating  in  practice-based  professional  devel-
opment  opportunities,  something  that  has  made  a  difference  for
both  me  and  my  students  is  the  modeling  provided  by  mentor
teachers.

When  I  began  teacher  preparation  course  work,  I  already  had
schema in place for what this job of teaching is all about. As a stu-
dent,  I  had  already  spent  years  learning  what  teachers  and  stu-
dents  did.  My  early  memories  of  mathematics  in  an  elementary
school  classroom  were  doing  multiplication  problems  on  the  chalk-
board, and there was always a winner in this exercise. The winner

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:20 May 31, 2005 Jkt 020424 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\041405\20424.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

was the person who solved the problem exactly like the teacher told
her  to,  who  finished  first,  and  who  got  the  right  answer.  I  also  re-
member  being  told  stories  about  borrowing  eggs  from  the  teacher
next  door,  and  apparently  that  had  something  to  do  with  subtrac-
tion,  but  at  the  time,  I  was  pretty  confused.  But  I  figured  my  col-
lege classes would clear all of that up for me.

What  I  did  not  know  then  was  that  much  has  changed  since  I
was  in  elementary  school.  Research  now  tells  us  that  students
learn  best  when  given  time  and  opportunities  to  construct  their
own understanding of concepts with invented procedures leading to
deeper  understanding  rather  than  imitating  a  procedure  dem-
onstrated by a teacher.

One might expect that my college course work provided opportu-
nities  for  me  to  review  and  consider  current  research  about  teach-
ing.  Unfortunately,  this  was  not  the  case.  However,  I  was  lucky
enough to be influenced very early in my career by a truly master-
ful teacher.

As  a  pre-service  teacher,  I  was  assigned  to  spend  two  days  per
week  in  Mr.  Wong’s  third  grade  classroom.  I  was  told  that  this
teacher  was  an  excellent  math  teacher,  and  I  thought,  ‘‘Oh,  good.
This is where I will learn how to tell the egg story and how to ex-
plain  multiplication  clearly  so  kids  don’t  forget  which  number  to
put  on  top,’’  but  I  wasn’t  prepared  for  what  I  experienced  in  this
classroom.

First  of  all,  I  never  heard  Mr.  Wong  telling  anyone  how  to  do
anything.  The  students  were  doing  all  of  the  talking.  They  dis-
cussed  and  debated  mathematical  ideas.  They  used  models  and
manipulatives  to  explain  their  thinking.  They  asked  themselves
and  each  other  questions.  Wrong  answers  were  made  public  and
used  as  sites  for  learning.  I  was  amazed  by  the  conversations  kids
were having. Well, I decided rather quickly that borrowing eggs did
not  matter.  I  wanted  to  know  how  to  get  my  students  to  talk  and
think like Mr. Wong’s students.

The  time  I  spent  in  that  classroom  helped  me  to  re-invent  my
idea of what learning looks like. I learned that kids can do amazing
things  as  long  as  the  teacher  has  some  things  in  place.  Teachers
need  to  create  a  culture  of  collaborative  inquiry,  where  students
trust themselves and each other to make sense of important ideas.
Teachers and students must learn to honor disequilibrium as an in-
tricate  part  of  learning.  Teachers  must  present  children  with  en-
gaging,  non-routine  tasks,  while  asking  questions  that  help  mis-
conceptions  to  surface,  rather  than  ‘‘explaining  away’’  any  mis-
understanding.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Barnes follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CASSANDRA BARNES

Good  morning  Committee  Members  and  esteemed  colleagues.  My  name  is  Cas-
sandra Barnes and I teach second grade in Milwaukie, Oregon. I have been teaching
for  12  years  in  North  Clackamas  School  District,  which  serves  suburban  students
just  outside  Portland.  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  about
what has made a difference in my continued professional development as a teacher,
which in turn makes a difference for my students.

When  I  began  teaching,  an  experienced  colleague  and  I  attended  a  typical  one-
day  workshop  designed  to  give  teachers  ideas  to  take  back  to  their  classrooms.  At
the  end  of  the  day,  I  was  bored  stiff  and  regretting  the  $200  I  had  spent  to  attend

27

walk  away  with  one  good  idea  to  take  back  to  the  classroom,  it  was  worth  it.’’  I
thought  about  that  comment  many  times.  Honestly,  my  first  thought  was,  ‘‘Oh.
Okay.  I  didn’t  realize  that  that  was  how  it  was  supposed  to  work.’’  The  more  I
thought about it, the less sense it made. Would it be reasonable for me to teach for
an  entire  day  with  a  goal  of  each  child  taking  away  one  small  thing?  No.  Addition-
ally,  the  format  of  presentations  such  as  the  one  I  had  attended  did  not  fit  with
what  I  believe  about  how  we  learn.  Most  of  these  one-day  workshops  consisted  of
‘‘expert’’ teachers telling us how they did what they did. As attendees, we were not
required  to  think,  discuss,  or  apply  any  of  the  content.  I  was  definitely  not  an  en-
gaged learner.

Twelve  years  and  numerous  professional  development  opportunities  later,  I  con-
sider  myself  an  informed  consumer.  I  now  have  expectations  of  my  continuing  edu-
cation course work. I expect professional development opportunities to challenge my
thinking,  require  me  to  reflect  deeply  on  my  practice,  and  above  all,  result  in  im-
proved  learning  for  my  students.  These  things  do  not  happen  in  a  fun,  easy,  six-
hour workshop.

Effective  professional  development  for  teachers,  much  like  deep  learning  of  con-
tent  for  school  children,  takes  time.  It  must  be  long-term,  with  opportunities  to
apply new learning in the classroom and then reflect on the impact with colleagues.
It  involves  planning,  implementing,  and  reflecting  on  student  outcomes  with  peers,
asking ourselves and each other, ‘‘Why didn’t that work? What do I need to change?
What student-based evidence can I use as data to support my conclusions?’’

For  elementary  math  teachers,  professional  development  might  be  additional  col-
lege level course work in mathematics, taught by professors implementing teaching
practices  such  as  those  outlined  by  the  National  Council  of  Teachers  of  Mathe-
matics.  Many  of  us  were  taught  mathematics  in  much  the  same  way  as  the  early
workshops  I  attended  were  taught.  An  expert  told  us  what  and  how  to  think,  and
we  were  to  go  do  just  that.  Many  teachers  are  now  aware  that  we  need  to  re-learn
mathematics  the  way  our  students  are  learning  mathematics.  Constructing  models,
testing  conjectures,  and  discussing  our  ideas.  Deepening  our  own  understanding  of
the  mathematics  we  teach  will  allow  us  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  our  students.
Supporting  the  professional  development  of  pre-service  and  in-service  teachers  is
crucial.  I  believe  in  high  standards  for  all  students.  I  believe  all  children  can  learn
mathematics  with  understanding.  I  believe  that  the  National  Science  Foundation
funded, standards-based curricula are improving math education for students across
the  country.  However,  I  know  that  the  difference  for  kids  lies  in  the  hearts  and
minds  of  the  teachers  who  implement  the  curricula  and  standards.  If  the  Federal
Government wants to take steps to improve math and science education for our chil-
dren, they need to focus energy and resources on providing high quality professional
development for our teachers.

In  addition  to  participating  in  practiced  based  professional  development  opportu-
nities,  something  that  has  made  a  difference  for  both  me  and  my  students  is  the
modeling provided by mentor teachers.

When I began teacher preparation course work, I already had schema in place for
what this job of teaching is all about. As a student, I had already spent years learn-
ing  what  teachers  and  students  did.  My  early  memories  of  mathematics  in  an  ele-
mentary  school  classroom  were  of  doing  multiplication  problems  on  the  chalkboard.
There  was  a  winner  in  this  exercise.  The  winner  was  the  person  who  solved  the
problem  exactly  like  the  teacher  told  her  to,  who  finished  first,  and  who  got  the
right  answer.  I  also  remember  being  told  stories  about  borrowing  eggs  from  the
teacher next door. Apparently that had something to do with subtraction, but at the
time  I  was  pretty  confused.  I  figured  my  college  classes  would  clear  all  that  up  for
me.

What I did not know then was that much has changed since I was in elementary
school. Research now tells us that students learn best when given time and opportu-
nities  to  construct  their  own  understanding  of  concepts,  with  invented  procedures
leading  to  deeper  understanding,  rather  than  imitating  a  procedure  demonstrated
by a teacher.

One  might  expect  that  my  college  course  work  provided  opportunities  for  me  to
review  and  consider  current  research  about  teaching.  Unfortunately,  this  was  not
the  case.  However,  I  was  lucky  enough  to  be  influenced  very  early  in  my  career  by
a truly masterful teacher.

As a pre-service teacher I was assigned to spend two days per week in Mr. Wong’s
third  grade  classroom.  I  was  told  that  this  teacher  was  known  to  be  an  excellent
math  teacher.  ‘‘Oh  good,  I  thought,  this  is  where  I  will  learn  how  to  tell  the  egg
story  and  how  to  explain  multiplication  to  kids  so  clearly  that  they  won’t  forget
which  number  to  put  up  top.’’  I  was  not  prepared  for  what  I  experienced  in  this
classroom.

First  of  all,  I  never  heard  Mr.  Wong  telling  anyone  how  to  do  anything.  The  stu-
dents were doing all of the talking. They discussed and debated mathematical ideas.
They  used  models  and  manipulatives  to  explain  their  thinking.  They  asked  them-
selves and each other questions. Wrong answers were made public and used as sites
for learning. I was amazed by the conversations the children were having. I decided
rather quickly that borrowing eggs did not matter. I wanted to know how to get my
students to talk and think like Mr. Wong’s students.

The time I spent in that classroom helped me to re-invent my idea of what learn-
ing  looks  like.  I  learned  that  kids  can  do  amazing  things,  as  long  as  the  teacher
has some things in place. Teachers need to create a culture of collaborative inquiry,
where  students  trust  themselves  and  each  other  to  make  sense  of  important  ideas.
Teachers  and  students  must  learn  to  honor  disequilibrium  as  an  integral  part  of
learning.  Teachers  must  present  children  with  engaging,  non-routine  tasks,  while
asking questions that help misconceptions to surface, rather than ‘‘explaining away’’
any misunderstanding.

Not  every  pre-service  teacher  has  an  opportunity  to  spend  time  in  such  a  class-
room.  In  my  opinion,  my  experiences  in  Mr.  Wong’s  classroom  were  pivotal.  I  had
a picture of what was possible for my students. It soon became clear to me that the
role  of  models  and  mentors  in  the  training  of  pre-service  teachers  could  influence
the  beliefs  and  practices  of  new  teachers  in  a  way  that  college  course  work  could
never do.

I  have  been  blessed  to  benefit  from  high  quality  professional  development  and
mentoring relationships that have helped me to define what I believe is best for chil-
dren. My experiences have convinced me that if we want to support our school chil-
dren and help them to achieve, we need to support our teachers.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. Sanderson.

STATEMENT OF MS. LONNA SANDERSON, WILL DAVIS

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AUSTIN, TEXAS

Ms. SANDERSON. Thank you all for the opportunity to talk to you.

We really appreciate it.

Imagine that you are eight years old.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Can  you  get  the  microphone  a  little  bit

closer?

Ms. SANDERSON. Sure.
Imagine that you are eight years old. You enter room 408 at Will
Davis  Elementary  School  in  Austin,  Texas  for  the  first  time.  ‘‘This
is it. Projects. Hmm.’’ You have heard that there are lots of projects
in  third  grade,  but  what  about  science.  Will  there  be  science
projects?  There  she  is,  the  teacher.  What  is  that  she  is  wearing?
A lab coat? There is writing all over it. Look, kids’ handprints, kids’
writing. What does it say on her sleeve? ‘‘Science rules.’’

Now, imagine you are that same third grader and it is May. You
think  back  over  your  year  of  projects  and  learning,  and  here  is
what you remember.

Your Invent Austin project. You noticed a problem. Perhaps your
dad  doesn’t  like  to  eat  cereal  from  a  box,  because  all  of  those  bro-
ken  bits  and  crumbs  get  soggy  and  really  mess  up  his  milk.  Per-
haps  your  parents  have  yelled  at  you  when  you  wiped  your  ketch-
up-laden  hands  on  the  car  seat  while  you  were  inhaling  your  fast
food  dinner  on  the  way  to  soccer  practice.  You  decided  to  invent
something  to  solve  your  chosen  problem.  You  did  research  to  find
out  if  there  was  already  a  solution  to  the  problem.  There  wasn’t.
You made a model. It didn’t quite work, so you made another, and
maybe several more, until you finally had one that worked. A plas-
tic cereal box with a sifter at the bottom and another section under
it  with  a  trapdoor  to  empty  the  crumbs.  Now  dad  is  happy.  A
ketchup  pocket  that  is  attached  to  the  front  of  the  fries  container
so  all  you  have  to  do  is  squirt  your  ketchup  into  the  pocket  and
dip  your  fries  in,  one  at  a  time.  Voila.  No  messy  hands.  You  did
market research to see if people would buy your invention and how
much  they  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  it.  You  created  an  adver-
tising  plan.  This  whole  time,  you  kept  an  inventor’s  log  of  all  of
your work. Finally, you wrote up your invention and drew a labeled
diagram of it. You submitted it to be judged, and you won a medal.
Was that your favorite project? Or was it another one?

When  learning  about  sound,  you  used  drinking  straws  to  make
reed instruments. You devised a way to make the instruments play
different  pitches,  but  the  hardest  part  was  getting  that  reed  to
work  when  you  blew  on  it.  But  you  did  it.  And  your  teacher  said
you  could  take  it  out  to  recess  to  play  it.  Maybe  all  of  that  noise
in the classroom was making her a little crazy, but, hey, it was all
her idea to do this project.

But  don’t  forget  about  making  that  electromagnet.  Who  would
have  thought  there  could  be  so  many  ways  to  make  it  stronger?
More  winds  of  the  wire,  thicker  wire,  but  would  using  a  thicker
core  make  it  stronger?  And  then  you  used  your  electromagnet  to

make model telegraphs, and you sent messages from your group of
students to another group. Now that was cool.

Oh,  what  about  those  bean  plants?  We  all  thought  that  bean
seeds  would  need  soil,  water,  and  light  to  sprout.  Boy,  were  we
wrong.  They  sprouted  just  fine  in  a  covered  container  that  had  a
wet  coffee  filter  in  it.  Then  that  teacher  asked  us  if  we  could  con-
tinue  to  grow  these  bean  seeds  without  soil.  We  said,  ‘‘No  way.’’
But  she  taught  us  about  hydroponics,  and  then  we  put  the  plants
in  a  hydroponics  unit,  and  they  grew,  and  they  grew,  and  they
bloomed, and they made beans.

That  is  not  all.  Ouch.  Those  crayfish  can  pinch.  But  it  doesn’t
hurt much. We observed them and learned all about their physical
structures  and  adaptations.  We  watched  them  and  wrote  about
their  behaviors.  Whoa.  Look  at  that  crayfish  back  up  with  its  tail
tucked under when we reached toward it. Was it trying to scare us
off  when  it  reared  up  with  its  pinchers  spread  whenever  we  came
near?  Yeah.  That  is  one  of  its  behavioral  adaptations.  Another
time,  we  put  two  crayfish  together  to  see  what  they  would  do.  Oh,
my  goodness.  That  little  one  attacked  the  big  one  and  pinched  off
its  leg.  ‘‘But  don’t  worry,’’  our  teacher  said,  ‘‘it  will  grow  a  new
one.’’

Well,  tomorrow  is  the  big  day,  the  day  all  partner  groups  show
their  PowerPoint  shows  about  a  planet  to  our  parents.  We  learned
a  lot  about  each  planet  and  the  sun  and  about  making  presen-
tations  using  PowerPoint,  how  to  create  a  background,  insert  pic-
tures from the Internet, how to add sounds, and how to use transi-
tions  discriminatingly,  as  our  teacher  suggested,  so  that  our  audi-
ences  wouldn’t  get  dizzy  watching  fade-ins,  box-outs,  cover-downs,
and all of those other ones in one show. But when she wasn’t look-
ing, we tried all of them.

Ah,  it  has  been  quite  a  year.  Yes,  there  really  were  lots  of

projects in third grade, and boy oh boy, science really rules.

Now,  this  picture  of  third  grade  science  is  quite  different  from
what  I  experienced  when  I  was  in  third  grade  long  ago.  But  it  is
also  quite  different  from  what  my  students’  parents  experienced
not so long ago. Why is third grade science not taught by just read-
ing  a  textbook?  Because  students  learn  science  by  doing  science,
just as real-world scientists do. How is it possible to have this kind
of science teaching and learning?

Give teachers the science equipment and supplies they need, give
them  and  students  access  to  technology,  preferably  in  their  class-
rooms  and  in  a  computer  lab,  and  give  teachers  the  training  they
need to learn how to teach science.

In my school district, we have a dual science adoption, a textbook
and  kit-based  units.  We  have  a  science  resource  center  where  the
kits are housed, refilled with supplies after each use, and then de-
livered  to  schools  on  a  schedule.  We  use  our  textbooks  to  supple-
ment our learning and to learn about topics that aren’t in our kits,
such  as  the  planets.  My  district  also  subscribes  to  a  video-on-de-
mand service, so that when my students read about the character-
istics  of  the  sun,  I  can  pause  during  the  reading  lesson  and  show
a 
flares,  sunspots,  and
prominences.  I  have  four  computers  in  my  classroom  for  students
to  use,  and  we  also  can  use  our  computer  lab  when  we  all  need  to

do  research  or  prepare  presentations.  Teachers  in  my  district  are
required  to  take  training  on  all  of  the  kits  we  teach.  During  these
training  sessions,  we  participate  in  many  of  the  activities  that  we
will  use  with  our  students,  and  we  learn  important  tips,  such  as
how  to  pick  up  a  crayfish  without  getting  pinched.  Teachers  also
have  access  to  many  technology  training  sessions  ranging  from
learning  the  operating  system  of  our  computers  to  using  programs
such  as  Inspiration  and  PowerPoint.  Because  of  these  advantages,
I  am  able  to  successfully  teach  science  and  to  guide  my  students
further  along  the  path  of  inquiry.  After  all,  in  third  grade,  science
rules.

BIOGRAPHY FOR LONNA SANDERSON

I currently am a third grade teacher at Will Davis Elementary School in the Aus-
tin  Independent  School  District.  I  teach  all  academic  subjects  to  my  students.  (By
far  their  favorite  subject  is  science!)  This  is  my  fifth  year  at  Davis,  and  it  is  my
twenty-fifth  in  the  Austin  School  District.  I  have  also  taught  at  Graham  Elemen-
tary,  where  I  taught  sixth  grade  and  fourth  grade,  at  Rosedale  Elementary,  where
I coordinated a Global Education Magnet Program, and at Winn Elementary, where
I  taught  fourth  grade.  Prior  to  making  my  home  in  Austin,  I  taught  in  Winder,
Georgia  and  Colbert,  Georgia  (both  third  grade);  in  Whitehall,  Michigan  (kinder-
garten  and  third  grade);  and  in  New  Martinsville,  West  Virginia  (Title  I  Math  and
sixth grade).

I  received  my  undergraduate  degree  in  education  from  East  Carolina  University
in Greenville, North Carolina in 1969 and my Master’s degree in education from the
University of Georgia in 1973. I became a National Board Certified Teacher in 2000.
This was the greatest honor of my career—until I was named a Presidential Award
for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching Awardee!

Ms. Martinez-McDonald.

STATEMENT OF MS. PITA MARTINEZ–McDONALD, CUBA

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CUBA, NEW MEXICO

Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. These are very hard acts to follow.
Anyway, what I would like to do is paint a picture of my teaching

and my students.

I  teach  in  Northwestern  New  Mexico,  a  rural  area.  My  students
are  Navajo,  Hispanic,  and  Anglo.  And  because  our  setting  is  bor-
dering  the  Navajo  checkerboard  area  where  every  other  section  of
land  is  Navajo  and  private  land,  we  have  sort  of  a  unique  setting.
My school district covers 1,800 square miles. Many of my students
travel two hours on the bus one way. That is K–12. Often, because
our school district has the only high school in the area, what fami-
lies tend to do is they—high school students have to go to the Cuba
schools,  but  middle  school  and  elementary  students  can  go  to  Bu-
reau  of  Indian  Affairs  (BIA)  schools.  But  since  parents  have  a
choice,  students  tend  to  school  hop.  So  we  have  students  that  at-
tend  our  school  for  first  to  second  grade.  They  go  back  to  the  BIA

from school to school. Paperwork often doesn’t follow them until the
middle  of  the  year.  Perhaps  you  might  have  no  background  infor-
mation on a student. So we have a lot of diverse problems that we
have to deal with every day.

Some  of  the  things  that  have  really  improved  my  teaching  and
things  that  have  helped  me  become  a  better  teacher  are  RSI  pro-
grams,  Rural  Systemic  Initiative  (RSI).  The  Northern  Network  of
Rural  Schools  is  a  consortia  of  27  school  districts  in  the  northern
area.  And  they  have  supported  us  in  offering  professional  develop-
ment  training.  One  thing  that  I  think  is  very  important  and  lack-
ing in many elementary schools is that elementary teachers do not
see  themselves  as  teachers  of  science  and  math.  They  see  them-
selves  as  teachers  of  reading.  And  until  we  get  over  that  hump  of
teaching  everything,  we  need  to  integrate  literacy  into  science  and
math.  We  need  to  choose  textbooks  very,  very  carefully  so  that  we
are addressing the needs of students.

Another activity besides the RSI is in 1981, the New Mexico Mu-
seum  of  Natural  History  and  Science  was  participating,  and  I  be-
lieve  it  was  an  NSF-funded  grant  to  strengthen  rural  science  edu-
cation. And as part of that program, they came into our schools and
several  schools  within  the  rural  areas  and  truly  worked  with  us
and found the needs that we had. It was a sustained effort. My col-
leagues  talked  about  one-day  workshops.  I  think  these—what  we
are  calling  now  are  drive-by  workshops  are  not  the  answer  to  im-
prove education in the classroom. We need sustained efforts, follow
up.  We  need  teachers  gaining  content  in  math  and  science  so  that
they  can  have  confidence  in  what  they  are  teaching  to  their  stu-
dents.  I  think  so  often  that  teachers  not  only  feel  that  they  don’t
know  enough  science  and  math  to  go  beyond  the  textbook,  that
they really don’t know to go beyond the textbook. We focus on read-
ing. Reading is everything, and it is everything, but we really have
to see ourselves as teachers of science.

One  of  the  questions  that  was  given  to  us  before  our  hearing  is
what  is  the  biggest  impediment  that  I  see  to  my  teaching  in  edu-
cation.  And  one  of  them—I  mean,  I  think  the  main  thing  is  pov-
erty.  The  students  that  I  teach,  for  the  most  part,  are  99  percent
free  and  reduced  lunch.  My  students  are  ELL,  English  language
learners.  They  have  languages  other  than  English  in  the  home.
And  even  students  that  have  English  as  their  only  language,  on
our  tests  that  we  give  them,  they  are  not  even  proficient  in
English.

Each day, I try to choose lessons that hook into culture and into
the  lives  of  my  students  so  that  I  can  use  that  as  the  support  to
help them unravel the tangle of life that they see before them and
they don’t understand. In your packets, I believe you got an article
about  one  of  the  communities  that  buses  their  children  into  the
Cuba schools that just received water, not water in the homes, but
a  central  location  where  they,  the  families,  can  go  and  get  water
and  then  bring  it  to  their  home.  I  mean,  these  are  daily  struggles
that  my  children  deal  with,  not  all  of  them,  but  enough,  probably
one-third. And they often go home to no electricity. How can a stu-
dent do homework if there is no electricity?

I  think  that  when  we  think  about  our  students  and  how  we  can
improve  what  we  do  for  them,  we  have  got  to  see  where  they  live.

I  think  that  immigrants  that  come  to  America  have  the  American
dream.  They  know  that  they  can  go  out  and  make  a  better  life  for
themselves  and  their  families,  but  students  of  poverty  who  live  in
America have lost the American dream. I think that through using
math and science that we can use that as a hook to give them that
dream back.
Thank you.

DISCUSSION

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much. Thank all of you.
The  Chair  recognizes  the  distinguished  Chairman  of  the  Sub-

committee on Research, Mr. Inglis.

Now  let  me  explain.  He  was  not  tardy.  This  is  an  excused  ab-
sence,  because  he  was  down  at  the  White  House  in  an  important
meeting, and he got up here as soon as he could.

The Chair recognizes him.
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for the ex-
cused  absence,  too.  That  is  very  helpful.  With  these  teachers  here,
I  would  be  worried,  otherwise  I  would  be  marked  on  my  progress
report.

It is wonderful to be here and to welcome and celebrate the work
of  these  teachers.  You  will  understand,  Mr.  Chairman,  why  I  am
particularly  excited  to  welcome  Joyce  Dodd  from  Bryson  Middle
School in Simpsonville, South Carolina. It is wonderful to have you
here. We are very proud of you and very thankful for the work that
you do with our middle school students.

And  there  is  a  facility  not  far  from  Bryson  Middle  School  in
Greenville  County  that  is  the  General  Electric  turbine  plant  that
employs  about  2,600  people,  1,000  of  them  are  engineers.  They
have a wonderful technology—a number of technologies, but one of
them  involves  coal  gasification  and  the  ability  to  take  pollutants
out of the coal before it is burned in their turbines.

The  reason  I  mention  that  is  I  was  visiting  there  recently,  and
I asked one of the executives if they had enough engineers. And he
said, ‘‘No. We could hire 300 more if we could just get them.’’ Now
what  that  tells  me  is  we  have  got  a  challenge.  And  the  solution  is
sitting  before  us:  people  who  can  inspire  and  make  science  and
math  real  to  students.  I  am  a  lawyer,  and  one  of  the  things  about
legal  education  that  makes  it  a  little  bit  easier  is  that  it  is—there
are  always  stories.  In  a  good  law  school,  the  first  thing  you  do  is
start  reading  cases,  and  a  case  is  a  story.  It  tells  about  a  person
and  what  happened  to  them  and  then  how  the  law  resolved  their
problem.

One  of  the  challenges,  seems  to  me,  about  math  and  science  is
making  it  real.  And  so  the  teachers  that  are  sitting  before  us  are
people  who  have  the  passion  for  making  it  real.  And  when  you
make it real and relevant, you make it so people want to learn, and
students get the passion for math and science.

It is important to note that General Electric is not alone. The De-
partment  of  Labor  estimates  there  will  be  six  million  job  openings
for  scientists,  engineers,  and  mathematicians  by  2008.  Sixty  per-
cent of the new jobs will require a solid mathematical background.
And  of  course,  we  have  got  a  significant  automotive  cluster  in  our
district,  and  when  you  think  about  it,  the  work  on  the  car,  even
the  auto  mechanics,  will  need  to  be  able  to  read  graphs,  under-
stand the timing diagrams, and to set and to reset microprocessors.
All of that involves the work that you are preparing your students
to do.

Of  course,  the  challenge,  as  we  know  on  this  committee,  is  that
we are not exactly on the path to filling those six million jobs I just
mentioned.  We  are  only  producing  60,000  engineers  per  year  com-

pared  to  over  a  half  a  million  per  year  in  China  and  India.  That
is  a  challenge  for  us.  And  I  think  it  is  worth  celebrating  what  you
are  doing,  because  I  really  do  believe  that  you  are  the  solution  to
this,  our  challenge  of  meeting  the  need  for  people  prepared  for
math and science. And so I am happy to join my colleagues in con-
gratulating you.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  do  appreciate

that.

You  are  all  experienced.  You  all  are  professionals  in  this.  And
Ms.  Barnes,  you  mentioned  in  your  testimony  that  you  need  en-
gaged learners. I hope you sensed that we are engaged learners up
here,  because  I  have  watched  my  colleagues,  and  I  have  had  a  lot
of experience in this business. And I will tell you, whether they are
Nobel laureates or people from the business world or high-level of-
ficials  from  the  Administration,  more  often  than  not,  if  I  sort  of
glance  left  and  right,  I  see  colleagues  reading  something  or  check-
ing  their  blackberries  or  something,  it  is  not  because  they  are  not
really paying attention or interested in the subject matter, it is just
that there are a lot of things on their docket. I have looked left and
right  and  you  have  got  us  in  the  palm  of  your  hand.  Thank  you
for doing an outstanding job.

Ms. Dodd, you were the first to have mentioned, but several oth-
ers mentioned, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Is
that something that everyone belongs to teaching math?

Ms.  DODD.  Unfortunately,  it  is  not.  One  of  the  reasons  is  the
membership  costs.  And  it  is  unfathomable  to  me  why  $78  would
stand  in  your  way  of  joining  such  a  valuable  organization,  but  at
our school, I know—we have 12 math teachers, and I know that we
don’t have too many members.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  you  know,  I  had  previous  history  in
the  real  world  out  there  in  the  business  community,  and  if  some-
thing  was  considered  important  to  my  job,  I  put  it  on  my  expense
account.

Ms. DODD. I don’t have one.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  No,  no,  no.  But  what  I  am  suggesting  is
more  and  more  we  have  got  to  think  about  all  of  the  additional
costs for teachers. And you know, we have, for the first time, a tax
deductibility  for  $500  I  think  it  is  out  of  out-of-pocket  expenses  of
teachers.  What  is  it?  $250?  Well,  it  should  be  $500.  All  in  favor,
say aye. Aye. It passes. But $250. It is the first time ever. It is rec-
ognition that—every educator that I have talked with tells me, but
particularly  elementary  and  secondary  education,  because  the  uni-
versities,  they  do  much  better  by  the  faculty.  But  they  say  they
have  a  lot  of  out-of-pocket  expenses,  whether  it  is  first  or  second
grade buying construction paper, you name it. And so this is some-
thing  we  could  do.  Is—would  you  be—would  that  be  an  eligible
item on the deductibility or the—all right. Good. So maybe you bet-
ter  share  that  with  your  colleagues.  I  can  guarantee  you  we  will
work up to $250. But——

Ms.  DODD.  Well,  let  me  mention  this.  It  is  a  little—I  think  it  is
relevant. I am the mother of a prospective first grade teacher, and
she was home over spring break, and I took her to the teacher sup-
ply  store  in  Greenville.  We  were  there  about  two  hours,  and  my

out-of-pocket expense for her classroom was about $350 just for the
supplies in her hands that she needed to teach her students.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  know,  and  I  mean,  it  just—a  lot  of  my
best friends are teachers. But they tell me this all of the time. And
so  I  mean,  I  am  always  asking  questions,  and  then  I  play  the  stu-
dent and try to learn from that and try to translate that into some
meaningful  action  here  in  Washington.  And  I  might  say  that  we
are  all  partners  in  this  endeavor.  You  don’t  have  an  opponent  of
that  tax  provision  up  here,  and  we  are  all  of  the  same  mind.  We
want to increase it, and I pledge to you and all of your fellow edu-
cators that we will continue that effort.

I  am  just  curious,  Ms.  Martinez-McDonald,  two  hours  on  a  bus.
And in rural America, that is on the long end, but I mean, kids are
spending  a  lot  of  time  on  buses  coming  and  going.  Is  that  produc-
tive time, and is there any way that educators are thinking about—
I  am  not  trying  to  add  to  your  burden,  but  how  do  you  use  that
time most effectively?

Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.  It  is  definitely  not  a  productive  time.
In  fact,  we  have  kindergarten  students  riding  on  buses  with  high
school students, who are not modeling good behavior.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I understand.
Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.  A  lot  of  the  travel  is  on  dirt  roads.  I
mean,  I  had  one  of  my  students  that  comes  from  this  community
that  just  got  water,  and  she  said,  ‘‘We  are  late  today  because  we
got  stuck  in  the  mud,  and  we  all  got  to  get  out  and  push.’’  And  I
think  about  my  own  children  getting  out  of  the  bus  and  pushing
it.  And  you  know,  she  was  thrilled.  They  were  happy.  Everybody
was  fine.  But  I  don’t  think  people  really  understand  what  some  of
these rural communities are dealing with. How can these students
come  to  school  and  think  about  school  when  they  are  dealing  with
so much in their own lives? It is hard to get above and beyond that.
We have, as a district, in the past, some of the wacky ideas that
we  have  come  up  with  was  perhaps  getting,  like,  big  buses  that
have  pull-down  computers,  so  that  they  could  access  lessons  or  in-
formation  on  the  Internet.  We,  at  one  point—I  don’t  know  that  it
was ever instigated, but they were talking about adding TVs to all
of  the  buses  so  that  they  could  have  distance  learning.  But  then
what  level  do  you  target?  How  do  you—who  maintains  that?  Who
produces the productions for the kids to watch?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. I mean, it was—it is just so many dif-

ferent facets that——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  would  imagine  in  your  situation  a  high
percentage  of  those  students  are  eligible  for  the  school  lunch  and
school breakfast program.

Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Ninety-nine percent free and reduced.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Is  that  a  possibility  to  productively  use
that  time  to  start  on  the  bus  with  the  breakfast  or  something?  Or
when they get to school, do they——

Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. They come from such a diverse——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah.
Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.—setting,  and  what  most  of  our  stu-
dents  do  is  they  walk  sometimes  a  mile  or  two  miles  to  the  bus

stop. They get one bus that takes that group of children to another
bus stop. Then they——

Chairman BOEHLERT. To a hub.
Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.—get  on—yeah,  to  a  hub,  essentially.

Then they move to the hub and then come into school.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, they better get used to it at this age,

school.

because we are all going to hubs for one——

Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Right.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—place or another.
Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Right.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah.
Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Right.
Chairman BOEHLERT. But boy, we can’t really come to appreciate

the great challenge faced by an educator in your circumstances.

Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Well, another——
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  kids  are  tired  by  the  time  they  get  to

Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.  Exactly.  And  we  have  huge  issues
with attendance. How do you get kids—I mean, how do we get our
kids to school?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah, well, it is a——
Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.  I  mean,  if  it  is  four  o’clock  in  the
morning,  you  are  getting  up  out  of  bed.  You  are  riding  your  bus.
And  then  it  doesn’t  make  it  to  school  because  of  the  mud  or  the
road conditions.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well——
Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. You know, all of that effort is wasted.
Chairman BOEHLERT. The red light is on for me, too, and I follow
it as well as I ask my colleagues to follow it as well as we ask the
witnesses to follow it.

Let  me  congratulate  you  all  for  the  nice  manner  in  which  you
have summarized your statements. I mean, you each had five min-
utes and you have stuck pretty close to it. So I appreciate that.

Let me give a tip before I go to Mr. Gordon.
Take  this  down.  There  is  a  website  that  I  will  invite  you  to  go
to.  It  is  www.baseballhalloffame.org.  And  the  reason  that  I  men-
tioned  this  at  the  breakfast  meeting,  the  baseball  hall  of  fame,  I
have—which  is  in  my  Congressional  District,  and  it  is  part  of  my
passion for life, baseball, but they—I had helped them secure fund-
ing  for  a  long-distance  learning  program  using  the  Internet  cre-
atively.  And  you  know,  baseball  is  a  game  where,  if  you  are  really
a  fan,  you  are  a  stats  freak.  You  want  to  know  batting  averages
and  everything  else,  and  you  want  comparisons.  And  the  baseball
hall  of  fame  devises  a  very  creative  program  that  is  available  on
the  Internet,  and  it  might  be  a  source  for  all  of  you  in  the  class-
room  to  just  take  a  look  at  it  and  see  if  it  is  worthwhile  to  add  to
your  curricula,  because,  you  know,  some  third  graders  say,  ‘‘Boy,  I
know  my  favorite  player  is  batting  .328.’’  You  know,  how  did  he
find that out? You know.

Well, use it.
Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I also want to thank the witnesses for those very good state-

ments.

And  I  would  like  to  ask  if  any  of  you  have  used  any  materials
in  developing  a  lesson  plan  that  you  received  from  any  federal
agency,  like  the  National  Science  Foundation  or  NASA.  And  if  so,
how did you learn about it, and how helpful was it?

Ms. Martinez-McDonald.
Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Recently, I have been teaching an as-
tronomy  space  science  course,  and  I  have  used  a  lot  of  the  NASA
online  materials  and  downloadable  materials.  They  have  been  in-
valuable. They have given me resources that I wouldn’t have access
to  in  the  first  place.  And  then  we  have  also  used  our—we  recently
used  DTT  monies  to  buy  a  portable  lab  for  our  classroom  so  that
students  could  get  on  the  incredible  NASA  site  and  access  the  in-
formation  and  their  links  about  the  universe,  and  they  were  all
able  to  create  what  we  call  ‘‘webbie  books’’  and  download  pictures
and  information  from—that  we—from  the  NASA  site  and  other
sites that they linked to their site.

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  let  me  just  ask  the  panel  and  also  everyone
in  the  back.  Raise  your  hand  if  you  have  used,  again,  NASA  or
NSF for materials. And of those, has anyone—have they been help-
ful?  Have  they  been  beneficial?  Okay.  Well,  let  me  make  this  rec-
ommendation. As I mentioned earlier, two things. One, everyone on
this  panel  or  this  committee,  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  is  very  sup-
portive of the National Science Foundation and the K–12 math for-
mula. You know, I am sure that the President is not anti-math and
science,  by  any  means,  but  they  want  to  cut  this  program  by  half.
And  so  I  hope  that  when  you  are  there  at  the  White  House  today,
again,  they  are  not  mean,  ugly  folks,  but  they  probably  just  don’t
understand  the  importance  and  how  helpful  this  has  been.  I  hope
that you will use this opportunity to convey that.

Let me also say, as a father of an only child, four-year-old daugh-
ter,  the  motto  around  our  house  is  that  girls  rule  and  boys  drool.
And what I would like to do is just take a quick moment, both per-
sonally and professionally, to get the panel’s suggestions. I am sure
you  have  been  following  the  national  discussion,  I  think  it  is  more
a discussion than a debate, as to women’s aptitudes in science and
math  and  the  lack  of  women  at  the  later  stages  in  that  field  and
also, maybe potentially a part of that is some reticence that we un-
derstand  that  girls  have  in  class  to  ask  questions,  and  all  of  that
sort of thing.

So  one,  I  would  like  to  see,  you  know—or  just  what  are  your
thoughts  about  that,  and  both—what  are  you  seeing  and  what  do
you think we should do about it?

Ms. DODD. I have to answer that one.
I  am  the  mother  of  a  set  of  twins,  a  boy  and  a  girl,  who  both
excel in math and science. So I know that if there is any difference,
it  is  cultural.  It  is—I  don’t  think  it  exists.  I  noticed  that  in  my
math class, I don’t see a difference between the girls and the boys.
On the math team that we took to competition to Clemson, we had
half  girls  and  half  boys  that  participated  in  that.  So  we  had  an
even amount. Wasn’t that your question?

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  I  am  sorry.  What  I  have  seen  or  written  on
that  area  is  some  of  the  assumptions  are  that  women—it  is  not  a
matter of not having the ability and that——

Ms. DODD. Right.

Mr. GORDON.—the top levels, you know, they are as good or bet-
ter than any men. But you know, it is sort of a—it is a bell curve—
not  a  bell  curve.  I  guess  it  would  be  a  U  curve,  in  that  there  are,
overall, not as many that are as interested. Again, are you finding
that?  Again,  if  you  are  not,  that  is  great.  And  if  you  are,  what  do
we need? How do we address it?

Ms. DODD. Again, I am saying I am not finding that.
Mr. GORDON. Okay.
Ms. DODD. Our math council is sponsored by an engineering soci-
ety. And it is a very challenging competition. We had as many girls
as boys participating.

Mr.  GORDON.  Good.  Well,  does  anybody  else  have  any—do  you

concur or have any different experiences or any suggestions?

Cynthia?
Ms.  CLICHE.  I  think  you  see  that  later.  We  are  all  elementary
teachers,  and  I  think  at  the  elementary  level,  the  boys  and  the
girls,  you  know,  they  are—it  is  not  that  extra  peer  pressure.  I
think that comes in when they start hitting middle school and high
school and all of a sudden, for some reason, it is our culture or soci-
ety  that  there  is  different  expectations  for  boys  than  girls.  And  I
think  that  comes  later  in  life.  I  don’t  feel  like  I  see  it  as  much  in
elementary  school  as  I  think  if  you  asked  someone  in  the  high
school level. I think they are going to see that more so at the junior
high level.

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  with  the  deficiencies  that  we  have  in  mathe-

maticians and engineers, we certainly can’t waste, you know——

Ms.  CLICHE.  And  I—again,  I  think  it  is  that—how  are  we  treat-
ing them? You know. How is society perceiving, you know—what—
when you are looking at society, and you are looking at magazines,
and  you  are  looking  at  media,  what  are  you  seeing  out  there?  Are
you seeing girls portrayed as especially gifted in science and math?
I  am  looking  at  my  high  school  years,  when  I  was  in  high  school,
and  in  our  calculus  class,  there  were  two  females,  and  the  rest
were  males.  You  know,  something  happens  there.  I  was  never
treated  as  if  I  were  different.  I  was  very  fortunate.  Either  that,  or
I  just  didn’t  get  it.  One  or  the  other.  So—but  something  is  hap-
pening  there  where  the  girls  are  getting  the  perception  that  there
are other things more important, such as—and I don’t want to, you
know, stereotype anybody, but there are other things, once they get
into  high  school,  the  dating  and  the  boys  and  somehow  it  is—you
know.  I  think  that  is  where  you  are  going  to  see  it  more.  In  ele-
mentary  school,  my  children  are  gung  ho.  My  girls  and  my  boys.

Mr. GORDON. If I could just finish up on that.
Ms. CLICHE. Okay.
Mr.  GORDON.  In  terms  of  what  we  can  deal  with,  I  guess,  here,
in  the  NSF  and  in  the  NASA  materials,  is  it  presented  in  a  way
that  is,  you  know,  neutral,  or  is  it—should  there  be  something  to
have  women  more  out  front  or—I  mean,  is  there  anything  within
the  NSF  or  NASA  that  we  can  do  to  create  this  more  positive
image?  Or  is  it  already  there?  Are  you  satisfied  with  it?  You  are
satisfied with what is going on there? Okay. Thank you.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
And  I  would  just  point  out  a  couple  of  things  to  the  gentleman.
And  you  need  role  models.  I  mean,  if  we  are  talking  about—I  am

the  father  of  three  daughters  and  a  son,  but  role  models.  I  would
point out, and I am sure you are not going to miss this opportunity,
that  when  the  Shuttle  returns  to  flight,  the  Commander  of  that
Shuttle  is  going  to  be  Eileen  Collins,  the  first  time  in  history  a
woman  commanded  a  Shuttle.  She  has  piloted.  The  pilot  is  the
number two person. The Commander runs the whole show. A grad-
uate  of  a  community  college  in  upstate  New  York  went  on  to  the
university  and  became  a  distinguished  scientist  and  a  distin-
guished  military  career,  a  colonel  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  and  now
she  is  one  of  the  leading  astronauts  and  will  be  commanding  that
Shuttle.

And  the  second  thing,  all  of  the  engineering  societies  report  the
same thing constantly, and boy it is music to our ears. On the one
hand, the negative part is there is such a shortage. We need more.
But on the positive side, more and more young women are looking
at  careers  in  engineering.  And  that  is  exciting,  because  there  are
wonderful opportunities out there.

The Chair recognizes Mr. McCaul.
Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Not  to  play  one-upsmanship,  but  I  am—I  have  four  girls  in  my
family, so the girls do rule in my house. There is no question about
that.  But  I  did  get  a  tour  of  the  Johnson  Space  Center  last  week,
and it is phenomenal what they are doing out there. And I encour-
age  you  to—I  was  glad  to  see  the  showing  of  hands  of  all  of  you
who utilize what they have to offer, including, I was told to get as-
tronauts  out  to  some  of  the  schools  to  energize  our  young  people
to  get  involved  in  math  and  science.  And  I  think  any  time  you  get
an  astronaut  to  come  talk  to  your  kids,  that  is  going  to  be  a  home
run.

So I wanted to talk really briefly, in 1983, President Reagan ap-
pointed a Blue Panel Commission that released ‘‘A Nation At Risk.’’
In  the  report,  it  states,  ‘‘If  an  unfriendly,  foreign  power  had  at-
tempted to impose on America the mediocre education performance
that  exists  today,  we  might  well  have  viewed  it  as  an  act  of  war.’’
And  that  was  a  fairly  disturbing  finding.  I  think  we  have  made
progress,  but  I  think  we  can  do  a  lot  better.  I  would  be  interested
to hear your input on how we can do better.

But since Ms. Sanderson is a constituent of mine and supporter,
I  want  to  put  her  on  the  spot.  As  you  know,  in  our  hometown  of
Austin, we are very fortunate to have a lot of high tech in the area.
We  are  the  home  of  Dell  Computers,  Applied  Materials.  We  have
a presence there. And I was really intrigued by your innovative use
of technology in the classroom. And I was hoping you could maybe
elaborate  on  how  you  use  the  technology  as  a  tool  to  get  the  chil-
dren interested in learning, because as Mr. Inglis had talked about,
when  I  talk  to  these  high  tech  companies,  they  want  to  import
more  and  more  scientists.  In  fact,  they  asked  us  for  20,000  visas
so  we  could  import  scientists  from  India  and  China.  And  it  is  just
astounding to me that we can’t do that in our own country.

So  maybe—I  know  it  is  a  very  broad  question,  but  if  you  could
elaborate  on,  perhaps,  getting  children  interested  in  this  area  of
technology. Were the jobs—you know, we have the jobs, but we just
can’t find the people in our own country to fill them.

Ms.  SANDERSON.  In  my  classroom,  we  use  technology  just  as  a
tool.  It  is  not  ever  used  for  entertainment,  but  you  only  use  the
computers when you need to use them. We use videos that enhance
our  learning,  that  teach  something  that  we  need  to  learn.  And  the
students  are  free  to  use  those  pieces  of  technology  whenever  they
need  them.  I  mean,  they  don’t  even  ask.  They  just  get  up  and  go
use  it,  and  they  sometimes  have  to  wait,  because  somebody  else  is
on  the  computer,  and  you  better  not  go  to  the  bathroom,  because
you are going to lose your spot.

But  as  far  as  getting  them  interested  in  jobs,  third  graders  are
already interested in all of those jobs. I don’t know what the prob-
lem  is  in  keeping  their  interest  in  those  jobs.  I  don’t  know  what
we can do about that.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  And  that  is  what  the  report  seemed  to  indicate,
that  the  younger  ages,  they  do  quite  well.  It  is  when  they  get  to
K–12 is where you start to see the decline.

Ms. SANDERSON. All of the third grade girls and boys love science
and  math,  and  if  they  don’t  love  math,  I  make  them  write  ‘‘I  love
math’’  on  their  papers,  because  some  of  them  have  math  phobia,
and it is boys and girls. And if they have math phobia, by the time
they  leave  my  classroom,  hopefully  they  love  math,  because  they
have written ‘‘I love math’’ all year.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  And  I  guess  to  keeping  their  interest  in  the  older
years,  I  don’t  know  what  the  answer,  quite  honestly,  is  to  that.  I
know that, you know, a lot of the schools in our area are fortunate
enough to get technology donated to the schools——

Ms. SANDERSON. Right.
Mr.  MCCAUL.—and  I  don’t  know  if  that  is  true  for  the  other
teachers  on  the  panel,  but  I  think  that  does  peak  an  interest  as
well.

Are there any other comments on this issue?
Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. I would like to add to that.
I  think  it  goes  back  to—I  think  all  of  the  people  in  this  room,
science  and  math  are  foci  for  their  classrooms.  But  I  don’t  think,
generally,  in  many  classrooms,  that  that  is  the  case.  I  think  ele-
mentary  teachers  feel  that  they  don’t  have  enough  background
knowledge  and  content  knowledge.  And  so  many  students  get
science, especially science, after everything else is done. They have
done  social  studies.  They  have  done  everything  else.  And  then,  if
they get an hour of science a week, I think that would be a regular
occurrence in many classrooms. And I think that is where we need
to give elementary teachers, especially, that background knowledge
so  that  they  feel  confident  so  that  we  can  get  children  involved  in
science  all  of  the  way  through  elementary  schools,  so  that  they,
when they get to the middle schools and high schools, they feel con-
fident  that  they  have  got  the  background  that  they  need  and  then
they can progress. It is not just catch-up. I think that is what many
students are doing when they get to middle school and high school.
They  are  going,  ‘‘Oh,  I  don’t  know  this.  I  don’t  know  that.’’  And  it
is  because  they  haven’t  had  a  good  foundation  in  elementary
school.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  There  is—it  is  not  a  priority  on  the  curriculum,
and  the  teachers  don’t  have  the  right  background.  Is  that  what  I
am hearing?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:20 May 31, 2005 Jkt 020424 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\041405\20424.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

Ms. MARTINEZ-MCDONALD. Yeah.
Ms. SANDERSON. In Texas, that is not true. We give a science test
in fifth grade now, so it is a big priority to teach science. And that
is  maybe  one  advantage  of  giving  a  state  standard  test  in  sciences
that  it  makes  it  a  focus  for  the  school  districts  to  make  sure  that
all  of  the  kids  do  learn  it,  because  the  test  tests  what  they  have
been taught from second grade through fifth. So if the second grade
teachers  don’t  do  their  job,  then  the  fifth  grade  students  won’t
know what is on the test.

Mr. MCCAUL. Well, that is good to hear.
Ms.  SANDERSON.  But—so,  I  mean,  in  spite  of  the  disadvantages
of  having  to  give  all  of  these  tests,  there  are  some  possible  advan-
tages to them.

Mr. MCCAUL. Yeah.
Ms.  DODD.  I  would  like  to  add  that  I  think  one  place  that  we
could  impact  a  difference  is  in  our  teacher  training  programs.  I
think  when  we  send  our  kids  to  college,  and  if  they  choose  edu-
cation,  their  math  class  and  their  science  class  should  be  compat-
ible with that of math and science majors. It shouldn’t be a special
course, elementary ed., that if you change your mind you can’t use
that for anything. What does that tell us about the content of that
course? And I think that is an easy fix, and I think we need to hold
responsible  for  that.  And  I  think  that,  oftentimes,  elementary
teachers  feel  they  don’t  have  the  background  when  they,  indeed,
could have had the background.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Well,  I  see  my  time  has  expired,  but  I  do  want  to
thank  the  panel  for  everything  you  do  and  praise,  you  know,  the
work that you are doing. It is so important.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. I thank you.
The Chair recognizes Ms. Hooley.
Ms. HOOLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I would like to also welcome Heather Combs from Oregon today.

Again, congratulations to all of you.

I  want  to  start  out  with  Ms.  Barnes.  You  talked  about  Mr.
Wong’s  classroom.  And  I  would  like  to  know,  in  the  professional
and  development  workshops  and  in-service  training  that  you  have
participated  in,  what  percentage  is  focused  on  this  kind  of  collabo-
rative learning that you experienced in Mr. Wong’s classroom?

Ms.  BARNES.  Well,  I  would  say  now  that  I  am,  you  know,  an  in-

formed consumer——
Ms. HOOLEY. Yeah.
Ms.  BARNES.—I  won’t  stay  in  a  professional  development  setting
where  it  is  not  going  to  meet  my  needs.  So  the  courses  that  I  reg-
ister for and stay for——

Ms. HOOLEY. Yeah.
Ms. BARNES.—are classes where all of the teachers who are par-
ticipating  are  actively  engaged,  and  they  are  asking  to  reflect  on
their practice, and they are asking to—they are being asked to con-
sider  new  research  in  education  and  how  they  can  use  that  infor-
mation to change learning for the students in their classrooms.

I  would  say  that,  besides  the  fact  that  Mr.  Wong  painted  a  pic-

ture for me of what is possible for students——

Ms. HOOLEY. Yeah.

45

Ms. BARNES.—he also gave me a lot of direction in what is high-
quality professional development, how does that look, and how does
that  carry  over  into  your  practice.  But  it  is  something  that—I  just
feel  extremely  fortunate  that  I  was  able  to  have  this  experience
early  on  in  my  career,  because  I  have  many  colleagues  throughout
my district and state that the first time they take a course like the
ones  I  am  talking  about,  they  are  just  so  energized  and  over-
whelmed and saying, ‘‘This is amazing. This is great. I have needed
this  for  all  of  these  years.’’  There  is  just  maybe  not  enough  to  go
around. It is—for the people who plan the professional development
that  works,  it  is  hard  work  for  those  people,  just  like  teaching  the
way that we believe is hard work for us.

Ms.  HOOLEY.  But  my  question  is,  and  any  of  the  rest  of  you  can
answer  this  as  well,  how  often  do  you  find  the  in-service  training
or  the  professional  development  with  that  kind  of  energy  and  that
actively engaged? I mean, are those hard to find or are those com-
mon anymore?

Ms.  BARNES.  Yeah,  I  think  if  you  know  where  to  look,  then  you

can find it.

Ms. HOOLEY. Now wait a minute. If you know where to look, but
if—I  mean,  if  there  is  a  list  of  things  that  a  teacher  can  go  to  for
in-service  training  or  for  professional  development,  how  hard  is  it
to find those really good professional development courses?

Ms.  BARNES.  See,  I  guess  I  have  learned  to  look  at  who  the  pre-
senters  are.  You  know,  if  it  is  a  professional  development  oppor-
tunity  that  was  developed  by,  you  know,  the  EBC,  or  there  is  a
local  organization—non-profit  organization,  a  couple  in  Portland,
actually,  that  I  know  that  if  I  take  a  course,  it  is  going  to  be  high
quality. And there are some that I know I need to steer away from
them.  But  I  think  when  you  are  a  beginning  teacher,  you  need  to
have somebody tell you.

Ms. HOOLEY. How would you know? Yeah.
Ms. BARNES. You need to have a mentor to say, ‘‘You know what?

Don’t spend your money there.’’

Ms.  HOOLEY.  Okay.  And  then—and  anyone  else  can  talk  about
that  that  wants  to,  because  I  would  really  like  to  know  how  hard
that is to find one of those classes.

And the second question I have is, if there is one thing the Fed-
eral  Government  could  do  to  particularly  grade  school  teachers  to
get  them  excited  about  math  and  science  and  teaching  math  and
science  in  their  classroom—because  I  know  a  lot  of  teachers  have
a  phobia  against  math  and  science—what  would  be  the  one  thing
we could do to entice teachers to be involved, grade school teachers,
in  math  and  science  and  to  sort  of  get  rid  of  that  phobia?  What
would that be?

Ms. CLICHE. I guess I will answer.
Ms. HOOLEY. Okay.
Ms. CLICHE. And I have been talking. It is great having so many
colleagues  around,  so  of  course,  knowing  I  was  going  to  be  here
today and representing them, I did get a lot of input——

Ms. HOOLEY. Good.
Ms. CLICHE.—and I think I have gotten some input for that ques-

tion.

Ms. HOOLEY. Good.

46

Ms.  CLICHE.  One  thing  that  we  have  kind  of  thought  about  is  it
would be great if we had a math and science specialist in each ele-
mentary  school,  because  I  think  that  is  almost  like  having  your
professional  development  right  there.  I  think,  you  know,  when  I
started teaching, I almost felt isolated, that I was the only one that
thought  this  way,  that  taught  this  way.  And  then,  as  I  started
branching  out  and  meeting  other  colleagues  that  taught  and
thought  that  way,  it  really  helped  me.  So  if  you  have  a  math  and
science  specialist,  maybe,  in  the  elementary  school,  not  just  at  the
county,  because  there  are  so  many  schools  now  in  an  area,  that
could  come  in  and  actually  do  some  of  the  lessons  and  do  some  of
the  teaching  and  help  you  and  find  the  professional  development
that  you  need  that  is  important  to  you  that  you  see.  I  think  that
would be a great step.

Ms. HOOLEY. Okay. Any other comments?
Ms.  SANDERSON.  In  our  school  district,  we  use  investigations  in
data,  time,  and  space,  which  is  a  pretty  innovative  math  program,
but  we  have  used  it  for  several  years.  And  it  was  funded  through
a  government  grant.  I  am  not  sure  if  it  was  Eisenhower  or  NSF
or—it is NSF?

Ms. HOOLEY. NSF.
Ms. SANDERSON. And it was a—and part of the grant process was
there  had  to  be  a  professional  development  component.  Therefore,
every teacher in the district has to go through professional develop-
ment  to  learn  how  to  teach  it.  And  then  you  become  comfortable
with  teaching  it,  if  you  weren’t  comfortable  with  teaching  math,
other  than  through  a  textbook.  So  if  the  government  requires,  in
all  of  its  grants,  that  there  be  a  professional  development  compo-
nent and they actually have—they collect data on this professional
development every time we have one. So I think that just requiring
that makes sure that the districts then provide quality professional
development to ensure that the teachers aren’t phobic about it. And
we  have  the  same  thing  for  our  science.  We  are  required  to  have
science training before we can teach the kits. They won’t even send
the kits to our school until we have the training.

Ms. HOOLEY. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
The gentlelady’s time has expired.
The  distinguished  Vice  Chairman  of  the  Full  Committee,  Mr.

Gutknecht.

Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  thank  you  for
having  this  hearing.  I  want  to  thank  the  panelists  for  being  here
today.  I  think  this  is  an  important  hearing,  and  it  is  something
that  when  you  look  at  the  test  score  numbers  from  around  the
world and you compare ours to international scores, this has prob-
ably  already  been  mentioned,  we  do  very  well  in  the  elementary
grades. By eighth grade, we are starting to lose ground, and by the
time  they  get  to  twelfth  grade,  American  students  score  pretty
poorly. And we still haven’t really gotten our arms around why.

I  do,  however,  believe  that  success  leaves  clues.  And  if  you  look
at  what  is  happening  at  universities  and  in  many  communities
every  summer,  there  are  baseball  camps,  there  are  basketball
camps, and there are football camps. But I don’t see enough science
camps, and I don’t see enough math camps. And I think there has

to be a way that we can encourage our universities, encourage pri-
vate  enterprise,  and  frankly,  with  a  little  bit  of  help  from  the  Na-
tional Science Foundation and federal and state taxpayers’ dollars,
we ought to be able to encourage more of that. And that is just my
editorial  comment.  And  everywhere  I—we  are  doing  some  of  that
in my district, but I must confess, not nearly enough.

But the real question I wanted to get to is that we have—for ex-
ample  in  the  town  that  I  live  in,  Rochester,  Minnesota,  we  have  a
very  large  number  of  people  who  have  advanced  degrees  in  math
and  science,  and  that  is  because  we  have  a  little  medical  practice
that was started by two brothers by the name of Mayo, and we also
have the top research facility for IBM. We built the world’s fastest
supercomputer  now  in  Rochester,  Minnesota.  But  several  years
ago,  there  was  an  outreach  program  to  try  and  encourage  more  of
these  people  with  advanced  degrees  in  math  and  science  to  serve
either as mentors or some of them who had retired early or for one
reason or another to be able to teach. And I will be diplomatic. The
teachers  unions  took  a  somewhat  dispassionate  view  of  that  whole
idea.  Now  I  know  that  there  are  several  states  that  have  alter-
native  certification  programs,  and  I  would  like,  Ms.  Dodd,  for  ex-
ample, you started out, I think you said, teaching home economics,
and you moved into math. How difficult was it for you to get recer-
tified,  because  the  problem  is  we  have  Ph.D.s  in  mathematics  and
they can’t teach mathematics at the local high school?

Ms.  DODD.  I  am  glad  you  asked  me  that  question.  And  that  is
probably one of the reasons I have pursued this particular nomina-
tion  or  award  was  because  I  wanted  to  validate  my  worth  as  a
mathematics teacher.

I  was  very  lucky  to  be  able—because  I  really,  honestly,  believe
that  being  a  teacher  is  essential,  but  I  don’t  want  to  diminish  the
need  for  content.  And  I  am  a  middle  school  teacher.  I  see  myself
more  as  a  middle  school  teacher  than  an  elementary  teacher.  This
is  one  of  the  few  times  I  am  not  with  my  buddies,  the  high  school
teachers.  Normally,  that  is  who  I  am  with.  And  I  think  content  is
essential.  But  I  think  it  is  easier  to  teach  a  person  content  some-
times than it is to teach them how to teach.

So I think that retooling and retraining existing teachers who de-
sire  to  be  in  a  mathematics  classroom  is  a  really  good  investment,
and  I  have  a  national  board  in  early  adolescence  mathematics,
which requires content knowledge. And I absolutely do not want to
diminish  the  necessity  of  content  knowledge  if  you  are  going  to
teach  mathematics.  I  have  to  know  what  comes  after  sixth  grade
math.  It  will  affect  how  I  teach  math.  Knowing  my  high  school
friends,  knowing  that  it  is  more  important  that  my  kids  under-
stand fraction operations to be successful in algebra than it is inte-
gers  was  very  helpful  to  me  in  preparing  my  children.  My  buddy
on  my  team  is  a  science  teacher  who  was  an  engineer.  So  he  is
coming to our school from an alternative program, also. He is a dy-
namic  teacher.  He  has  the  heart  of  an  engineer,  but  the  mind  of
a teacher. He sponsored a robotics club with our school, and we ac-
tually  got  to  state  competition.  And  so  I  absolutely  welcome  alter-
natives.

I  was  accepted  in  the  math  community  and  given  a  chance  to
grow, and I think that, as teachers, we need to accept people from
outside communities and give them a chance to grow.

Mr. GUTKNECHT. Thank you.
Ms. DODD. So I agree with them.
Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  Anybody  else  want  to  comment  on  that,  on  the
ability of people from the outside to come in and be able to at least
contribute?

Ms.  MARTINEZ-MCDONALD.  I  would  like  to  share  an  experience
that  I  have  had.  New  Mexico  has  various  labs,  and  a  few  years
back, all of the labs had what was called the Cyad program where
they  coupled  scientists  in  the  field  and  retired  scientists  with
schools,  and  they  came  into  our  schools  once  or  twice  a  month.
They provided background knowledge and content as well as activi-
ties in the classroom and supported us. Unfortunately, the program
was phased out, but I found that very helpful, because it was some-
body  that  I  knew  I  could  call  for  support.  They  would  be  in  the
school.  They  got  to  learn  kids.  They  realized  that  having  the
science had nothing to do with the teaching. And they provided the
science that I lacked, so that I could do the teaching that——

Mr. GUTKNECHT. Thank you very much.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Mr. Davis.
Mr.  DAVIS.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much,  and  Ranking
Member, for having the hearing today and certainly the five panel-
ists  who  have  given  great  testimony  and  all  of  the  members  from
throughout the different states that are here to join and participate
in the activities you have had since Sunday, and I think will prob-
ably last through this coming Saturday.

I  grew  up  in  a  rural  area.  My  first  school  was  a  one-teacher
school  where  we  walked.  It  started  in  1948.  As  you  look  at  the
teaching in 1948, it was basically three ‘‘R’’s. I graduated from high
school  in  1962,  and  when  I  graduated  from  high  school  in  1962,  I
had heard a young man a year earlier, or a year and a half earlier,
say,  ‘‘We  will  send  a  man  to  the  moon  and  then  safely  return  him
by  the  end  of  this  decade.’’  And  there  was  no  science  being  taught
about  how  we  go  to  the  Moon  in  1962  or  in  1948  when  I  started
with  school.  We  have  seen  a  tremendous  change  and  a  huge
amount  of  knowledge  that  has  occurred  since  both  my  wife  and  I
went  to  school  at  a  place  called  York  High  School  in  Jamestown.
It  was  built  by  a  fellow  by  the  name  of  Sergeant  Alvin  C.  York
from Pall Mall, where I currently live today and where I was born
and raised. When he dedicated that school, he said, ‘‘I dedicate this
school to the children of Pall Mall, so they can enjoy the liberating
influences  of  an  education  denied  me  in  my  youth.’’  Liberating  in-
fluences  of  an  education  that  he  was  denied  as  he  traveled
throughout the world during World War I and became a great hero
for  America,  a  movie  of  which  has  been  made  of  his  life.  We  see
in  someone  who  had  the  vision  to  be  sure  that  education  became
a part of our lives.

I applaud each of you in this room for how you are imparting to
our  young  individuals.  I  have—as  my  wife  and  I  watched  our  chil-
dren  go  to  school,  we  realized  how  much  more  education  and
knowledge  was  available  to  be  taught  to  them  than  she  and  I  had

obtained  or  were  taught  when  we  were  going  through  school.  We
now  watch  our  five  grandchildren,  of  which  four  of  those  are  in
school,  two  in  Murfreesboro,  our  oldest  grandson,  who  will  be  15
on August the 1st, is an eighth grade graduate there last year, and
Alexa  is  still  there  at  McFaden.  But  we  see  such  a  change  in  edu-
cation  and  teachers  so  committed.  My  wife  teaches  second  grade.
She taught first grade for 14 years. My daughter, Lynn, teaches in
the school systems in Bart Gordon’s District. All of my children live
in Bart Gordon’s District for some reason. They can’t vote for their
daddy. And I have a son-in-law that teaches, and my oldest daugh-
ter  actually  teaches  home-schoolers.  But  the  two  children  I  just
mentioned go to public schools at McFaden and Murfreesboro.

So there has been such a change from the three ‘‘R’’s to what we
have  today  and  the  challenges  that  we  have  had.  Growing  up  in
a  rural  area,  Ms.  Martinez-McDonald,  is  a  challenge.  The  bus  left
my  home  at  six  o’clock  for  the  eight  o’clock  school.  I  was  the  first
on  the  bus  and  my  sisters  and  brothers  were,  because  my  mother
and  father  had  actually  drove  the  bus.  One  of  them  would.  Each
morning,  we  would  change  at  the  elementary  school  and  then  go
up the mountain to Jamestown.

So  as  we  look  at  trying  to  change  or  to  improve  how  we  teach
our  students  and  how  we  teach  our  young  men  and  women,  our
young students, the children that we are teaching, I know that that
is  a  tremendous  challenge  for  you.  Math  and  science  was  some-
thing  that  was  always—it  was—it  seemed  to  be  away  from  my
grasp,  but  I  always  wanted  to  reach  out  and  be  a  part  of  science
and  math.  I  applaud  your  efforts,  how  you  impact  the  lives  of  fu-
ture  generations  of  this  country.  And  I  don’t  agree  that  America
has got the worst education system in the world. We absolutely are
the  only  Nation  in  the  world  that  has  the  economic  strength  that
we  have  and  the  military  strength  that  we  have.  No  nation  can
even equal us. And why? It is because of educators like you in this
room  and  throughout  our  systems  throughout  the  Nation.  Oh,  we
can  complain  and  we  can  talk  about  areas  where  we  need  to  im-
prove,  and  we  should  always  strive  to  do  that,  but  because  of  you,
America is where it is today.

I tell young students, when I visit them in schools, that you can
have a Maserati, I don’t know what that is. That is a fine car, they
say,  or  you  can  have  the  biggest  mansion  in  the  world,  and  if  you
can’t economically continue to fund it, you will lose all of those as-
sets  you  think  you  have.  But  an  education  is  an  asset  that  you
never can lose, and you can always use that. And you are the ones
who make that happen.

I  have  a  teacher  here  today  from  a  rural  area  similar  to  where
I grew up, Ms. Beverly Ramsey, from the West Elementary School.
She  is  actually  from  Viola,  which  is  about  the  same  size  as  Pall
Mall  where  I  grew  up  in  Fentress  County.  And  I  applaud  her  and
congratulate her, as each of you should be congratulated, for being
able  to  win  the  competition,  and  I  am  sure  it  is  pretty  stiff,  to  be
here today.

My question, and I am about to run out of time, is this. How has
‘‘No  Child  Left  Behind’’  impacted  your  ability  to  teach?  Do  either
of  you  want  to  answer  that?  And  here  is  why  I  ask  that.  Here  is
why I ask that. I think we have to look at achievability of each stu-

50

dent and be sure that that child is not left behind. And if we don’t
place  an  achievability  as  well  as  accountability,  we  could  never
reach an accountability level. So how has it impacted?
My time is running out, I guess, so that is—we——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Your time has run out. But just let me say
that I think we all embrace the subject and the theme that no child
should be left behind. And let me point out, we are spending more
on  education  in  America  than  ever  before  in  the  history  of  the  Re-
public,  and  we  need  to  spend  more.  It  is  a  very  wise  investment.

Mr. DAVIS. Saved by the bell.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah.
Here  is  what  happens.  We  are  going  to  have  a  series  of  votes
now,  so  we  will  go  next  to  Dr.  Bartlett,  a  Ph.D.,  I  might  add,  Dr.
Bartlett  who  is  deeply  and  passionately  interested  in  this  subject
matter.

And then I think if he can keep to the five-minute limit, we will
get  to  Mr.  Honda,  and  then  we  are  going  to  have  to  end  this,  be-
cause  we  will  go  over  for  a  series  of  votes,  and  we  can’t  keep  you
around  all  day.  And  it  might  be  a  half-hour  to  45  minutes  before
we can get back, and that would be disruptive.

So Dr. Bartlett.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.
I want to apologize for a schedule that tries to cram five days of
work  into  less  than  two  days  this  week,  which  meant  that  at  10
o’clock  this  morning,  I  was  supposed  to  be  in  four  places  at  once.
So I am glad that I am finally able to get here.

In  another  life,  I  spent  24  years  as  a  teacher.  I  worked  for  a
number  of  years  as  a  scientist.  And  I  have  had  a  growing  concern
about  two  things  in  our  country,  both  of  which  are  culture-driven.
One  of  them  is  our  inability  to  attract  enough  students  to  science,
math, and engineering. As an example of the portent for the future,
we graduate about 70,000 a year. The Chinese graduate 200,000 a
year,  roughly  three  times  more  than  we.  And  India  graduates
150,000 a year, a bit more than twice what we graduate. And that
is  to  say  nothing  about  the  fact  that  about  half  of  all  of  the  grad-
uate  students  in  science,  mathematics,  and  engineering  in  our
country are Chinese and Indians. So the discrepancy is even bigger
than that.

I  am  very  much  concerned  that  for  the  short-term,  this  poses  a
real  threat  to  our  economic  superiority.  We  will  not  continue  to  be
the  world’s  premier  economic  power  if  we  can  not  attract  enough
high-quality  students  to  science,  math,  and  engineering.  And  by
the way, the bright, young minds in our country today are increas-
ingly  going  into  what  I  tell  them  are  potentially  destructive  pur-
suits. They are becoming lawyers and political scientists.

And  you  know,  I  have  two  questions.  The  first  staff-generated
question  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  our  kids  don’t  start  out  be-
hind.  In  the  fourth  grade,  they  are  about  on  par  with  students  in
the  rest  of  the  world,  and  in  the  eighth  grade,  not  so  bad,  and  by
the twelfth grade, they have fallen way behind. In a recent survey,
worldwide,  we  were  very  thankful  for  Sri  Lanka  and  Cyprus,  be-
cause  they  were  the  only  two,  out  of  21  countries,  I  think,  whose
students  fared  worse  in  science,  math,  and  engineering  than  ours
did. You know, you get what you appreciate in a society. And I will

believe that our culture is changing when the White House invites
academic  achievers  and  appreciates  them  the  way  we  appreciate
athletic achievers in our country. And you know, when you are call-
ing bright young men in our schools ‘‘geeks’’ and ‘‘nerds’’ and pretty
girls won’t date them, and when pretty girls have to play dumb so
that  they  can  get  a  date,  don’t  you  think  that  this  sends  the  mes-
sage  that  there  may  be  something  wrong  in  our  society  that  we
have got to change our culture?

So I am very much concerned about two things.
One is what do we have to do so that we can attract more bright,
young  people  to  these  careers?  And  what  do  we  have  to  do  so  that
we  are  doing  a  better  job  of  educating?  It  is  awfully  tough  to  take
a  student  from  high  school,  who  is  at  the  bottom  of  the  barrel  in
comparison with students from most other industrialized countries,
and  then  to  turn  out  a  really  quality  graduate  from  our  graduate
schools.  What  can  we  do  to  attract  more,  and  what  can  we  do  to
make sure that we have—that we do a better job? Because it is not
our  kids  that  are  failing,  it  is  we  who  are  failing.  They  start  out
okay, and the longer they go to school, the worse they get. Doesn’t
that send a message?

And  by  the  way,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  24-year  fall  in  SAT  scores
follow  the  24-year  increase  in  the  size  and  influence  of  the  federal
Department  of  Education.  Do  you  think  there  might  be  a  cause-ef-
fect relationship? I won’t ask you to answer that question.

But  my  two  questions,  what  do  we  have  to  do  to  attract  more,

and what do we have to do to do a better job of training them?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Identify yourself, if you will, for the record.
Ms. JONES. I am Linda Jones, and I am from Alabama.
Our  state  has  undergone  a  lot  of  changes  recently.  Of  course,
with  ‘‘No  Child  Left  Behind,’’  and  elementary  teachers,  especially
in the K–3 area, we have focused so heavily in reading and making
sure  that  our  children  are  on  target,  and  it  has  cost  us,  I  think,
in the science area. And we have also focused heavily in the math.
But  in  Alabama,  we  have  been  looking  at  changing  how  we  teach.
And  a  lot  of  times,  we  are  so  squeezed  into  the  afternoon  to  teach
the math and science, that we don’t take the time, or we don’t have
the  time,  to  lay  out  all  of  the  manipulatives  and  the  things  that
turn children on and help them understand the concepts and really
know  what  they  are  doing.  Instead  of  just  being  able  to  add,  why
are we adding and really what are the concepts behind it.

We  are  working  on  what  we  call  an  arts  program,  or  a  testing
program  that  will  test  the  science.  I  am  getting  a  little  nervous
here, having to stand. I have to take a deep breath.

But  one  of  the  things  that  we  are  working  on  is  AMSTY,  and
AMSTY  is  a  math  and  science  and  technology  program.  And  the
first  step  that  we  are  having  to  do  is  go  back,  take  our  teachers,
and retrain them, train them in stepping back instead of being the
teacher, just be a facilitator and putting out the manipulatives and
letting  the  students  work  with  those  manipulatives  and  discover
new  ideas  themselves.  And  that  takes  retraining.  And  it  takes
time.  And  then  it  takes  supplies.  I  did  not  have  the  supplies  that
the——

Chairman BOEHLERT. It takes resources, too.
Ms. JONES. That is right.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  are  just  running  very  short  on  time,
and I want to give Mr. Honda the opportunity to have a few obser-
vations.

So thank you very much for that intervention.
Ms. JONES. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Honda.
Mr.  HONDA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member.  I
appreciate this forum, and let me tell you, as a school teacher my-
self,  I  appreciate  what  it  is  that  you  do.  I  am  a  science  teacher.  I
taught  high  school,  so  I  had  to  wait  for  your  work  to  be  done.  My
wife,  since  1965,  was  a  kindergarten  teacher,  or  what  I  say,
‘‘kindegarten’’ teacher. And as her husband for many years, I have
to get used to the word ‘‘no’’ more than once. She couldn’t ever say
‘‘no’’ once. She says, ‘‘No, no, no.’’

Having said that, I would like to associate myself with all of the
comments that the Chairman and the Ranking Member had shared
with you.

But just to let you know that we understand what it is that you
have to do on a daily basis, such as put up with more policies that
policy-makers pass and place upon your shoulders without the due
compensation,  or  having  assumed  that  compensation  will  be  there
once we pass a law. We need to hear your voices constantly saying,
‘‘No  unfunded  mandates.  If  you  are  going  to  make  a  promise,
please  keep  them.’’  This  committee  is  one  of  the  most  bipartisan-
focused  committees  that  there  is.  We  understand,  also,  that  math
and  science,  in  itself,  are  not  the  only  curricular  activities  that  go
on in a classroom and that integration and not compartmentalizing
math  and  science  is  critical,  too,  and  that  is  what  K–6,  K–8  folks
do,  and  they  do  that  well.  We  just  haven’t  figured  out,  on  a  na-
tional  basis,  how  to  put  together  teacher  training  programs  that
have a degree, a professional degree that recognizes that.

Another  thing  is  that  I  think  we  understand  the  distinction  be-
tween  parity  and  equity.  You  are  given  funds  to  deal  with  things
in the concept of parity, but we say equity. And ADA is parity, not
equity, because you know that each child has needs and each child
has  different  kinds  of  needs  and  different  amounts  of  money  that
would  support  that  child’s  access  to  equal  opportunities  in  edu-
cation. So we understand that. And our struggle is to try and figure
out how we keep in touch with you so that we translate your expe-
riences  into  public  policy,  your  insights  into  public  policy,  so  that
it is more, if you will, elegant. And you need to keep in touch with
us,  almost  on  a  daily  basis,  with  every  one  of  the  435  Members  of
Congress  to  make  sure  that  public  policy  does  reflect  your  needs,
because as a teacher, I know that things get put on top of you say-
ing,  ‘‘There  is  too  much  fat.’’  You  know,  ‘‘There  are  places  to  cut.
We don’t know why you can’t manipulate or manage your budget.’’
And  once  we  start  cutting,  at  the  end  of  the  year,  after  all  of  the
cuts,  the  school  closes,  kids  graduate,  kids  get  promoted,  and  peo-
ple say, ‘‘Hmm, there must be more fat out there.’’

We understand that that isn’t the case, that instruction is some-
thing  that  you  need  to  invest  in  and  that  the  investment  is  some-
thing  that  is  realized,  not  only  in  math  and  science,  but  music,
which  is  probably  the  paramount  expression  of  math  and  science.

And  so  I  just  want  to  get  on  my  soapbox  and  let  you  know,  as
teachers,  that  you  are  a  cornerstone  of  this  democracy.  Don’t  give
up  the  ship.  Keep  fighting  for  these  youngsters.  And  we  are  going
to do our part here in Congress to make sure that we back up our
words  with  the  kinds  of  efforts  that  you  need  in  your  classrooms.

So thank you very much.
And Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. What an eloquent closure to this very pro-
ductive  hearing.  Thank  you  so  very  much,  Mr.  Honda.  And  thank
all  of  you.  Now  the  clock  says  we  have  about  three  minutes  and
20  seconds  to  get  from  this  building  over  to  the  Capitol  in  order
to vote.

Thank you, once again.
Mr. HONDA. I need a hall pass.
[Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
