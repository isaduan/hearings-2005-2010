HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The National Nanotechnology Initiative

Amendments Act of 2008

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 16, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On  Wednesday,  April  16,  2008,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will
hold a hearing to review legislation that proposes changes to various aspects of the
planning  and  implementation  mechanisms  for  and  to  the  content  of  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The legislation includes changes to strengthen the
planning  and  implementation  of  the  environment,  health,  &  safety  (EHS)  compo-
nent  of  NNI;  to  increase  emphasis  on  nanomanufacturing  research,  technology
transfer, and commercialization of research results flowing from the program; to cre-
ate a new NNI component of focused, large-scale research and development projects
in  areas  of  national  importance;  and  to  enhance  support  for  K–16  nanotechnology-
related education programs.

The legislation is based on findings and recommendations from formal reviews in
2002 and 2006 of the NNI by the National Academy of Sciences and in 2005 by the
President’s  Council  of  Advisors  for  Science  and  Technology,  which  currently  serves
as  the  advisory  committee  for  the  NNI;  witness  testimony  from  NNI  hearings  from
this  and  the  past  Congress;  and  recommendations  resulting  from  staff  discussions
with various stakeholder groups.

A section-by-section summary of the bill is attached as an appendix to this memo.

3. Overarching Questions

• Does  the  legislation  address  key  issues  for  improving  the  way  the  NNI  is
planned and implemented and for ensuring that the program is positioned to
help maintain U.S. leadership in nanotechnology?

• Are  the  changes  proposed  in  the  legislation  to  strengthen  the  planning,  co-
ordination,  and  prioritization  process  for  research  to  address  concerns  about
environmental  and  safety  ramifications  of  nanotechnology  likely  to  be  effec-
tive?  Is  the  requirement  for  a  minimum  funding  level  for  this  aspect  of  the
program reasonable and necessary?

• Will  the  bill  assist  in  overcoming  the  barriers  to  commercialization  of
nanotechnologies, help enhance NNI support for research in areas relevant to
the needs of industry, and make user facilities supported under the NNI more
welcoming to industrial users, thereby assisting with the transfer of research
results to usable products that benefit the public?

• Is  there  a  need  for  resources  under  the  NNI  to  be  readjusted  to  include  a
component  for  support  of  large-scale  research  and  development  projects  fo-
cused on specific problems of national importance?
• Does  the  proposed  legislation  adequately  address  support  for  nanotechnology

education under the NNI?

4. Background
Summary of Past NNI Hearings

During  the  110th  Congress,  the  Committee  has  held  three  NNI  related  hearings.
The  first,  Nanotechnology  Education  [Serial  No.  110–60],  was  held  October  2nd,
2007 by the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education. The witnesses, who
represented  the  Federal  Government,  industry,  and  educational  institutions  and
science  educators  at  all  levels,  agreed  that  nanotechnology  education  is  an  impor-
tant  component  of  a  strategy  to  capitalize  on  the  promise  of  this  advancing  field.
Several  witnesses  discussed  the  importance  of  early  nanotechnology  education,  in-
cluding  informal  education,  for  generating  awareness,  information  and  excitement
about nanotechnology among young students and the general public. Witnesses were
unanimous in expressing support for increasing formal education in nanotechnology
beginning at the undergraduate level, including at two-year colleges because of their
important  role  in  supplying  much  of  the  21st  Century  skilled  workforce.  A  rep-
resentative from the National Science Foundation provided an overview of the many
activities in formal and informal nanotechnology education at all levels already sup-
ported by the Federal Government.

A  second  hearing,  Research  on  Environmental  and  Safety  Impacts  of
Nanotechnology: Current Status of Planning and Implementation under the National
Nanotechnology  Initiative  [Serial  No.  110–69],  was  held  on  October  31,  2007.  This
hearing  addressed  the  need  and  motivation  for  research  on  the  environmental,
health and safety (EHS) aspects of nanotechnology. In addition, the hearing sought
to  determine  the  current  state  of  planning  and  implementation  of  EHS  research
under  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI),  and  explore  whether  changes
are  needed  to  the  current  mechanisms  for  planning  and  implementing  EHS  re-
search. Witnesses included the representatives from the organizations charged with
the development of the EHS plan as well as non-governmental organizations focused
on  the  societal  implications  of  nanotechnology.  The  hearing  highlighted  the  unani-
mous  position  by  all  witnesses  regarding  the  importance  of  EHS  research  for  the
development of nanotechnology and the necessity of a well designed and adequately
funded  EHS  research  component  of  the  NNI.  However,  there  was  concern  that  the
interagency  planning  for  and  implementation  of  the  EHS  research  component  of
NNI was not moving with the urgency it deserved. While the organizations respon-
sible  for  plan  development  and  implementation  claimed  that  the  current  process  is
effective and that the participating agencies believe the process is working well, the
non-governmental  organizations  were  unanimous  in  their  recommendations  for
changes  in  the  planning  process  as  well  as  increases  in  the  priority  of  EHS  in  the
overall NNI basic research funding.

A third hearing, The Transfer of National Nanotechnology Initiative Research Out-
comes for Commercial and Public Benefit [Serial No. 110–82] was held on March 11,
2008  by  the  Subcommittee  on  Research  and  Science  Education.  Witnesses  included
representatives of State- and federally-funded nanotechnology research and user fa-
cilities,  industry,  and  a  state-based  technology  transfer  and  funding  organization.
The  witnesses  stressed  the  importance  of  basic  research  in  nanomanufacturing  and
adequate  funding  of  geographically  diverse  user  facilities.  The  witnesses  were  clear
that  basic  research  funding  should  be  broad  to  allow  for  new  discoveries  and  pio-
neering research; however, they indicated that it would be wise to focus some fund-
ing  and  planning  toward  commercialization.  They  suggested  that  this  might  be  ac-
complished  through  demonstration  projects  or  by  defining  areas  of  global  competi-
tiveness.  Many  of  the  witnesses  testified  that  the  SBIR  and  ATP/TIP  programs  are
very important for the development of innovative technologies and felt that the pro-
gram should emphasize the funding of nanotechnology projects.

NNI Organization and Funding

The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  was  authorized  by  the  21st  Century
Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  of  2003  (P.L.  108–153).  In  accord-
ance with the Act, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) through the
Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering,  and  Technology  (NSET)  Subcommittee  plans  and
coordinates the NNI. The Act authorized the National Nanotechnology Coordination
Office (NNCO) to provide technical and administrative support to the NSET for this
coordination. There are currently twenty-six federal agencies that participate in the

National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  with  13  of  those  agencies  reporting  a  research
and  development  budget.  Research  related  to  the  NNI  is  organized  into  eight  pro-
gram  component  areas  including:  Fundamental  Nanoscale  Phenomena  and  Proc-
esses;  Nanomaterials;  Nanoscale  Devices  and  Systems;  Instrumentation  Research,
Metrology,  and  Standards;  Nanomanufacturing;  Major  Research  Facilities  and  In-
strument Acquisition; Environment, Health, and Safety; and Education and Societal
Dimensions. More information on the organization and structure of the NNI can be
found  in  the  Congressional  Research  Service  Report,  The  National  Nanotechnology
Initiative:  Overview,  Reauthorization,  and  Appropriations  Issues  at  http://
www.congress.gov/erp/rl/pdf/RL34401.pdf.

The  total  estimated  NNI  budget  for  FY  2008  was  $1.49  billion.  Total  planned
funding  for  the  NNI  in  FY  2009  is  $1.53  billion.  More  information  on  the  NNI  pro-

Spending on EHS, Nanomanufacturing, and Education
EHS:  The  President’s  FY  2009  budget  requests  $1.5  billion  for  the  NNI.  Of  this
amount,  the  budget  proposes  $76.4  million  (five  percent  of  the  overall  program)  for
research  on  EHS  research.  This  is  a  30  percent  increase  over  the  FY08  funding
level. More than 40 percent of this funding would go to NSF.
Nanomanufacturing  and  Commercialization:  The  FY  2008  estimated  budget  for
nanomanufacturing  research  (a  component  that  is  closely  tied  to  bridging  the  gap
between basic research and the development of commercial products) was $50.2 mil-

lion  dollars  which  is  3.3  percent  of  the  total  budget.  The  NNI  planned  investment
in nanomanufacturing research for FY 2009 is $62.1 million, a 24 percent increase.
This  amount  is  four  percent  of  the  total  FY  2009  proposed  budget.  In  addition,
$161.3 million is planned for major facilities and instrument acquisition, which can
be utilized towards production of prototypes leading to commercialization.
Education:  As  part  of  its  contribution  to  the  NNI,  NSF  supports  a  number  of  edu-
cational  activities  designed  to  teach  K–16  students,  science  teachers,  faculty  mem-
bers,  and  the  general  public  about  nanotechnology.  Major  education  programs  in-
clude  the  National  Center  for  Learning  and  Teaching  (NCLT)  in  Nanoscale  Science
and  Engineering  and  the  Nanoscale  Informal  Science  Education  (NISE)  Network.
NCLT  is  a  consortium  of  five  universities  with  a  mission  to  foster  the  Nation’s  tal-
ent in nanoscale science and engineering (NSSE) by developing methods for learning
and  teaching  through  inquiry  and  design  of  nanoscale  materials  and  applications.
They  perform  research  and  serve  as  a  clearinghouse  for  information  regarding
NSSE curriculum, teaching methodologies, and professional development for the un-
dergraduate  and  K–12  levels.  NCLT  is  operating  in  the  last  year  of  a  five-year
$15,000,000  million  grant.  The  NISE  network  received  a  $12.4  million  dollar  grant
from NSF in 2005 to develop methods of introducing the nanotechnology to the pub-
lic and to draw students to careers in NSSE.

NSF  also  has  a  Nanotechnology  Undergraduate  Education  Program  funded  at
$42.7  million  since  2003.  The  grants  in  this  program  have  gone  to  develop  cur-
riculum  and  purchase  equipment  for  undergraduate  students  in  different  science
and engineering disciplines. As part of the Advanced Technology Education Centers
program,  NSF  has  provided  $2.68  million  since  2004  to  develop  nanotechnology  re-
lated technician education programs at community colleges.

Environment, Health, & Safety Planning

In  October  2003,  the  NSET  organized  an  interagency  Nanotechnology  Environ-
mental  and  Health  Implications  (NEHI)  Working  Group  to  coordinate  environ-
mental  and  safety  research  carried  out  under  the  NNI.  One  of  the  NEHI  Working
Group’s  initial  tasks  was  developing  a  prioritized  plan  for  EHS  research.  In  March
2006, the Administration informed the Science Committee that this report would be
completed  that  spring,  but  the  document  that  was  finally  released  in  September
2006  was  a  non-prioritized  list  of  EHS  research  areas.  A  further  iteration  of  the
EHS  research  plan,  which  was  released  for  public  comment  in  August  2007,  pre-
sented  a  rationale  for  the  process  of  defining  EHS  research  priorities  and  provided
a  reduced  set  of  priorities  based  on  the  previous  report.  Finally,  in  February  2008,
the  Strategy  for  Nanotechnology-Related  Environmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Re-
search2 document  was  released.  This  document  provided  a  more  in  depth  assess-
ment of current research needs and priorities; however, it failed to provide a sched-
ule  and  timelines  for  meeting  objectives  and  the  proposed  funding  levels  by  topic
and by agency.

Commercialization and Technology Transfer of Nanotechnology
User Facilities

The  NNI  funding  agencies  support  nanotechnology  user  facilities  to  assist  re-
searchers  (academic,  government,  and  industry)  in  fabricating  and  studying
nanoscale  materials  and  devices.  The  facilities  may  also  be  used  by  companies  for
developing  ideas  into  prototypes  and  investigating  proof  of  concept.  The  National
Science  Foundation  supports  17  facilities  under  its  National  Nanotechnology  Infra-
structure  Network  (NNIN),  four  of  which  are  focused  on  nanomanufacturing.  The
Department of Energy maintains five Nanoscale Science Research Centers, each fo-
cused  on  and  specific  to  a  different  area  of  nanoscale  research.  The  National  Insti-
tutes of Health has a Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory in Frederick, MD
and  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  maintains  a  user  facility
in Gaithersburg, MD. The application processes for each facility varies; however, all
are  open  to  academic,  government,  or  industry  users.  In  addition  to  the  user  facili-
ties, the NNI is carried out in over 70 centers and institutes3 throughout the coun-
try mostly on university campuses, many of which have user facilities that are open
to all applicants.

SBIR/STTR Programs

P.L.  108–153  encourages  support  for  nanotechnology  related  projects  through  the
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Trans-
fer  Research  (STTR)  programs  by  requiring  the  National  Science  and  Technology
Council  to  ‘‘develop  a  plan  to  utilize  federal  programs,  such  as  the  Small  Business
Innovation  Research  Program  and  the  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  Re-
search Program, in support of the [NNI activities]. . ..’’ Despite the lack of a formal
plan,  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  have  been  used  as  a  vehicle  to  bring
nanotechnology  research  developed  by  small  business  concerns  closer  to  commer-
cialization.  The  total  SBIR  and  STTR  program  spending  in  all  technology  areas  in
FY  2006  was  nearly  $2.2  billion,  of  that  budget  $79.7  million  was  identified  as
nanotechnology  related  research.4 This  was  3.7  percent  of  the  total  SBIR/STTR
spending  in  FY  2006  and  included  nine  federal  agencies.  SBIR/STTR  funding  is  al-
lowable for development of technologies from concept to prototype; however, funding
of  scale-up  to  manufacturing  does  not  fall  within  the  SBIR/STTR  scope  of  funding.

5. Witness Questions

All  witnesses  were  asked  to  give  their  views  on  the  provisions  of  the  bill,  includ-
ing  any  recommendations  for  ways  to  improve  it.  The  list  of  overarching  questions
(item 3 above) was included in the invitation letters.

Provides an explicit funding source for the National Nanotechnology Coordination
Office (NNCO)—each participating agency provides funds in proportion to the agen-
cy’s fraction of the overall NNI budget—and requires the NNCO to report annually
on  its  current  and  future  budget  requirements,  including  funding  needed  to  create
and maintain new public databases (see following provision) and to fulfill the public
input and outreach requirements specified in the 2003 Act.

Requires the NNCO to (1) develop a public database for projects funded under the
Environmental,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS),  Education  and  Societal  Dimensions,  and
Nanomanufacturing  program  component  areas,  with  sub-breakouts  for  education
and  ELSI  projects;  and  (2)  develop,  maintain  and  publicize  information  about
nanotechnology facilities available for use by academia and industry.

Specifies that the NNI Advisory Panel must be a stand-alone advisory committee
(at  present  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  for  Science  and  Technology  is  as-
signed this role).

Requires  the  NNI  Advisory  Panel  to  establish  a  sub-panel  with  members  having
qualifications  tailored  to  assessing  the  societal,  ethical,  legal,  environmental,  and
workforce activities supported by the NNI.

Revises  the  charge  to  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  for  the  content  and

scope of the triennial reviews of the NNI.

Provides an explicit funding authorization to OSTP of $500K/year for FY09–11 for

the NRC triennial reviews.
SEC. 3. Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology

Assigns  responsibility  to  an  OSTP  associate  director  (to  be  determined  by  the
OSTP  Director)  to  fulfill  the  role  of  Coordinator  for  the  societal  dimensions  compo-
nent  of  NNI.  The  coordinator  is  (1)  responsible  for  ensuring  the  strategic  plan  for
EHS  is  completed  and  implemented;  (2)  serves  as  the  focal  point  for  encouraging
and  advocating  buy-in  by  the  agencies,  and  monitoring  their  compliance,  in  pro-
viding the resources and management attention necessary; and (3) is responsible for
encouraging the agencies to explore suitable mechanisms for establishing public-pri-
vate partnerships for support of EHS research.

Requires  the  Coordinator  to  convene  and  chair  a  panel  of  representatives  from
agencies  supporting  research  under  the  EHS  program  component  area  to  develop,
annually update, and coordinate the implementation of a research plan for this pro-
gram component. The plan, which is to be appended to the statutorily required NNI
annual report, must contain near- and long-term research goals and milestones, in-
clude multi-year funding requirements by agency and by goal, and take into consid-
eration  the  recommendations  of  the  NNI  Advisory  Panel  and  the  agencies  respon-
sible for environmental and safety regulations. The plan must include standards de-
velopment  activities  related  to  nomenclature,  standard  reference  materials,  and
testing methods and procedures.

Requires that at least 10 percent of the total NNI budget be allocated to the EHS

program component area.

Establishes Nanotechnology Education Partnerships as part of the NSF Math and
Science  Partnership  (MSP)  program  to  recruit  and  help  prepare  secondary  school
students to pursue post-secondary education in nanotechnology. These partnerships
are  similar  to  other  MSPs,  but  must  include  one  or  more  businesses  engaged  in
nanotechnology  and  focus  the  educational  activities  on  curriculum  development,
teacher professional development, and student enrichment (including access by stu-
dent to nanotechnology facilities and equipment) in areas related to nanotechnology.
Requires  the  Program  to  include  within  the  Education  and  Societal  Dimensions
program  component  area  activities  to  support  nanotechnology  undergraduate  edu-

cation,  including  support  for  course  development,  faculty  professional  development,
and acquisition of equipment and instrumentation. To carry out these activities, the
bill  authorizes  an  additional  $5M  per  year  for  FY  2009  and  FY  2010  for  the  NSF
Course,  Curriculum,  and  Laboratory  Improvement  program  (undergraduate  STEM
education  program  open  to  all  institutions  of  higher  education)  and  an  additional
$5M  per  year  for  FY  2009  and  FY  2010  for  the  NSF  Advanced  Technological  Edu-
cation program (open only to two-year institutions).

Requires  formation  of  an  Education  Working  Group  to  coordinate,  prioritize,  and

plan the educational activities funded under NNI.
SEC. 4. Technology Transfer

Requires  agencies  supporting  nanotechnology  research  facilities  under  NNI  to
allow, and encourage, use of these facilities to assist companies in developing proto-
type  products,  devices,  or  processes  for  determining  proof  of  concept.  The  agencies
are  required  to  publicize  the  availability  of  these  facilities  and  provide  descriptions
of the capabilities of the facilities and the procedures and rules for their use.

Requires agencies to encourage applications for support of nanotechnology projects
under SBIR and STTR programs, requires publication of the plan to encourage this
within six months (plan originally required under the 2003 Act), and requires a re-
port  that  will  track  the  success  of  the  programs  in  attracting  and  supporting
nanotechnology projects.

Requires  NIST  to  encourage  submission  of  proposals  under  the  Technology  Inno-
vation  Program  (TIP)  for  support  of  nanotechnology  related  projects  and  to  report
to Congress on how this is to be accomplished and on the outcome of the effort over
time.  Requires  the  TIP  Advisory  Board  to  provide  advice  to  the  program  on  ways
to  increase  the  number  of  nanotechnology  related  proposals  and  to  assess  the  ade-
quacy of funding provided for such proposals.

Encourages the creation of industry liaison groups in all relevant industry sectors
(four  currently  exist)  and  specifically  suggests  establishing  one  focused  on  compa-
nies that produce and use composite materials.

Adds to the activities enumerated by the 2003 Act that are required to be carried
out  under  the  NNI  the  coordination  and  leveraging  of  federal  investments  with
nanotechnology  research,  development,  and  technology  transition  initiatives  sup-
ported by the states.
SEC. 5. Research in Areas of National Importance

Requires  the  NNI  to  include  support  for  large-scale  research  and  development
projects involving collaborations among universities, industry, federal labs, and non-
profit research organizations to accelerate development of promising nanotechnology
research discoveries toward near-term solutions to problems in areas of national im-
portance, such as electronics, energy efficiency, health care, and water remediation.
Requires  that  the  competitive,  merit  based  selection  process  for  awards  and  the
funding of these awards be carried out through a collaboration between at least two
agencies  and  that  the  award  selection  process  take  into  favorable  consideration  the
availability of cost sharing from non-federal sources.

Project  awards  may  be  for  support  of  interdisciplinary  research  centers,  and  all
must  include  a  plan  for  transferring  technology  developed  under  the  projects  to  in-
dustry.
SEC. 6. Nanomanufacturing Research

Specifies inclusion of research under the Nanomanufacturing program component
area  to  include  projects  to  develop  instrumentation/tools  for  rapid  characterization
and  monitoring  for  nanoscale  manufacturing  and  to  develop  techniques  for  scaling
nanomaterial synthesis to industrial-level production rates.

Requires  that  centers  established  under  the  NNI  on  nanomanufacturing  and  on
applications  in  areas  of  national  importance  (SEC.  5)  include  support  for  inter-
disciplinary research and education on methods and approaches to develop environ-
mentally benign nanoscale products and nanoscale manufacturing processes.

Requires  a  public  meeting  and  subsequent  review  by  the  NNI  Advisory  Panel  of
the  adequacy  of  the  funding  level  and  the  relevance  to  industry’s  needs  of  research

Chairman  GORDON.  Good  morning.  This  hearing  will  come  to
order, and I want to welcome everyone to today’s hearing to review
a  draft  Committee  bill  on  the  amendment  in  order  to  amend  and
strengthen  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative.  I  think  this  is
one  of  the  most  important  hearings  that  we’re  going  to  have  this
year.  I  know  that  we  have  a  busy  day  for  Members  in  other  com-
mittees,  but  we  have  a  lot  of  staff  watching  this  on  TV;  and  so
there  will  be  a  lot  of  information  that  will  be  communicated  from
the hearing, and I appreciate you again being here.

The  term  revolutionary  technology  has  become  a  cliche´,  but
nanotechnology truly is revolutionary. We stand at the threshold of
an  age  in  which  materials  and  devices  can  be  fashioned  atom-by-
atom  to  satisfy  specified  design  requirements.  Nanotechnology-
based  applications  are  arising  that  were  not  even  imagined  a  dec-
ade ago.

Nanotechnology is not a single technology, but rather is a collec-
tion  of  tools  and  concepts  for  observing,  controlling,  and  manipu-
lating matter at the atomic scale.

The  range  of  potential  applications  is  broad  and  will  have  enor-
mous consequences for electronics, energy transformation and stor-
age,  materials,  and  medicine  and  health,  to  name  just  a  few.  In-
deed,  the  scope  of  this  technology  is  so  broad  as  to  leave  virtually
no product untouched.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  recognized  the  promise
of  nanotechnology  early  on,  holding  our  first  hearing  a  decade  ago
to  review  federal  activities  in  the  field.  The  Committee  was  subse-
quently  instrumental  in  the  development  and  enactment  of  a  stat-
ute 
interagency  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative,  or  the  NNI.  The  2003  statute  put  in
place  formal  interagency  planning,  budgeting,  and  coordinating
mechanisms for NNI. It now receives funding from 13 agencies and
has  a  budget  of  $1.5  billion  for  fiscal  year  2008,  which  represents
a doubling of the budget over the last five years.

that  authorized 

The  NNI  statute  also  provides  for  formal  reviews  of  the  content
and  management  of  the  program  by  the  National  Academies  and
by  a  designated  advisory  committees  of  non-government  experts.
Their assessments of NNI have been generally positive.

The  cooperation  and  planning  processes  among  the  participating
agencies  in  the  NNI  have  been  also  largely  effective.  The  NNI  has
led  to  productive,  cooperative  research  efforts  across  a  spectrum  of
disciplines.  It  has  established  a  network  of  national  facilities  for
support of nanoscale research and development.

Therefore,  the  NNI  does  not  require  extensive  renovation.  The
draft bill leaves its major features unchanged but does adjust some
important  priorities  and  strengthen  some  specific  aspects  of  the
program. I would like to highlight two key features of the bill.

The  first  area  is  risk  reduction.  Nanotechnology  is  advancing
rapidly. At least 600 products have entered commerce that contain
nanoscale materials, including aerosols and cosmetics.

It is important for the successful development of nanotechnology
that  potential  downsides  of  the  technology  be  addressed  from  the
beginning in a straightforward and open way.

We  know  too  well  that  negative  public  perceptions  about  the
safety  of  technology  can  have  serious  consequences  for  its  accept-

ance  and  use.  This  has  been  the  case  with  nuclear  power,  geneti-
cally modified foods, and stem cell therapies.

The  science  base  is  not  now  available  to  pin  down  what  types  of
engineered  nanomaterials  may  be  dangerous,  although  early  stud-
ies  show  some  are  potentially  harmful.  We  don’t  yet  know  what
characteristics of these materials are most significant to determine
their  effect  on  living  things  or  the  environment,  nor  do  we  even
have  the  instruments  for  effectively  monitoring  the  presence  of
such materials in the air or water.

Although the NNI has from its beginning realized the need to in-
clude  activities  for  increasing  understanding  of  the  environmental
and  safety  aspects  of  nanotechnology,  it  has  been  slow  to  put  in
place  a  well-designed,  adequately-funded,  and  effectively  executed
research program.

The  environmental  and  safety  component  of  NNI  must  be  im-
proved  by  quickly  developing  and  implementing  a  strategic  re-
search plan that specifies near-term and long-term goals, sets mile-
stones  and  timeframes  for  meeting  near-term  goals,  clarifies  agen-
cies’  roles  in  implementing  the  plan,  and  allocates  sufficient  re-
sources to accomplish the goals.

is  the  essential 

for  the  development  of
nanotechnology  to  ensure  that  sound  science  guides  the  formula-
tion  of  regulatory  rules  and  requirements.  It  will  reduce  the  cur-
rent  uncertainty 
inhibits  commercial  development  of
nanotechnology and will provide a sound basis for future rule-mak-
ing.

I am interested in hearing the views of our witnesses on the pro-
visions of the bill relevant to the development and implementation
of  an  effective  environmental,  health  and  safety  research  compo-
nent  of  the  NNI,  and  particularly,  on  whether  it  would  be  bene-
ficial  to  specifically  set  aside  a  portion  of  the  overall  NNI  budget
for this purpose as is proposed in this bill.

The  second  area  of  the  legislation  I  want  to  highlight  involves

capturing the economic benefits of nanotechnology.

Too  often  the  U.S.  has  led  in  the  basic  research  on  the  frontiers
of  science  and  technology  but  has  failed  to  capitalize  on  the  com-
mercial developments flowing from new discoveries.

The NNI has so far invested approximately $7 billion over seven
years in basic research that is providing new tools for the manipu-
lation  of  matter  at  the  nanoscale  and  is  increasing  our  under-
standing of the behavior of engineered nanoscale materials and de-
vices.  Increased  consideration  should  now  be  given  to  support  ef-
forts  to  foster  the  transfer  of  new  discoveries  to  commercial  prod-

tion Program, established under the COMPETES Act.

For  example,  such  efforts  could  be  organized  around  developing
a  replacement  for  the  silicon-based  transistor,  developing  new
nanotechnology-based  devices  for  harvesting  solar  energy,  or
nanoscale sensors for detecting cancer.

The  draft  NNI  Amendments  Act  was  developed  on  the  basis  of
recommendations  from  the  formal  reviews  of  the  NNI  by  the  Na-
tional Academy of Sciences and by the President’s Council of Advi-
sors for Science and Technology, which currently acts as the exter-
nal  advisory  committee  to  NNI.  It  also  incorporates  recommenda-
tions from witnesses’ testimony from NNI hearings during this and
the  previous  Congress  and  from  comments  and  recommendations
resulting from staff discussions with various stakeholder groups.

This  legislation  is  still  a  work  in  progress.  Today  I  look  forward
to  the  observations  of  our  witnesses  and  invite  them  to  give  the
Committee their recommendations for ways to improve the bill.

I want to thank our witnesses for their attention at this hearing

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

I want to welcome everyone to this morning’s hearing to review a draft Committee

bill to amend and strengthen the National Nanotechnology Initiative.

The  term  ‘‘revolutionary  technology’’  has  become  a  cliche´,  but  nanotechnology
truly  is  revolutionary.  We  stand  at  the  threshold  of  an  age  in  which  materials  and
devices  can  be  fashioned  atom-by-atom  to  satisfy  specified  design  requirements.
Nanotechnology-based  applications  are  arising  that  were  not  even  imagined  a  dec-
ade ago.

Nanotechnology is not a single technology, but is rather is a collection of tools and

concepts for observing, controlling, and manipulating matter at the atomic scale.

The range of potential applications is broad and will have enormous consequences
for  electronics,  energy  transformation  and  storage,  materials,  and  medicine  and
health,  to  name  a  few  examples.  Indeed,  the  scope  of  this  technology  is  so  broad
as to leave virtually no product untouched.

The Science and Technology Committee recognized the promise of nanotechnology
early  on,  holding  our  first  hearing  a  decade  ago  to  review  federal  activities  in  the
field. The Committee was subsequently instrumental in the development and enact-
ment of a statute in 2003 that authorized the interagency National Nanotechnology
Initiative—the NNI.

The 2003 statute put in place formal interagency planning, budgeting, and coordi-
nating  mechanisms  for  NNI.  It  now  receives  funding  from  13  agencies  and  has  a
budget of $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2008, which represents a doubling of the budget
over five years.

The NNI statute also provides for formal reviews of the content and management
of the program by the National Academies and by a designated advisory committee
of non-government experts. Their assessments of NNI have been generally positive.

The  science  base  is  not  now  available  to  pin  down  what  types  of  engineered
nanomaterials may be dangerous, although early studies show some are potentially

cant to determine their effects on living things or on the environment.

Although  the  NNI  has  from  its  beginnings  realized  the  need  to  include  activities
for 
increasing  understanding  of  the  environmental  and  safety  aspects  of
nanotechnology, it has been slow to put in place a well designed, adequately funded,
and effectively executed research program.

The environmental and safety component of NNI must be improved by quickly de-
veloping  and  implementing  a  strategic  research  plan  that  specifies  near-term  and
long-term  goals,  sets  milestones  and  timeframes  for  meeting  near-term  goals,  clari-
fies  agencies’  roles  in  implementing  the  plan,  and  allocates  sufficient  resources  to
accomplish the goals.

This  is  the  essential  first  step  for  the  development  of  nanotechnology  to  ensure
that  sound  science  guides  the  formulation  of  regulatory  rules  and  requirements.  It
will  reduce  the  current  uncertainty  that  inhibits  commercial  development  of
nanotechnology and will provide a sound basis for future rule-making.

I am interested in hearing the views of our witnesses on the provisions of the bill
relevant  to  the  development  and  implementation  of  an  effective  environmental,
health  and  safety  research  component  for  the  NNI,  and  particularly,  on  whether  it
would  be  beneficial  to  specifically  set  aside  a  portion  of  the  overall  NNI  budget  for
this purpose, as is proposed in the draft bill.

The  second  area  of  the  legislation  I  want  to  highlight  involves  capturing  the  eco-

nomic benefits of nanotechnology.

Too  often  the  U.S.  has  led  in  the  basic  research  on  the  frontiers  of  science  and
technology but has failed to capitalize on the commercial developments flowing from
new discoveries.

The  NNI  has  so  far  invested  approximately  $7  billion  over  seven  years  in  basic
research that is providing new tools for the manipulation of matter at the nanoscale
and  is  increasing  our  understanding  of  the  behavior  of  engineered  nanoscale  mate-
rials  and  devices.  Increased  consideration  should  now  be  given  to  support  of  efforts
to foster the transfer of new discoveries to commercial products and processes.

The draft bill includes provisions to encourage use of nanotechnology facilities by
companies for prototyping and proof of concert studies, and it specifies steps for in-
creasing  the  number  of  nanotechnology  related  projects  supported  under  the  Small
Business Innovation Research Program and by the Technology Innovation Program,
established under the COMPETES Act.

To  increase  the  relevance  and  value  of  the  NNI,  the  draft  bill  also  authorizes
large-scale,  focused,  multi-agency  research  and  development  initiatives  in  areas  of
national need.

For example, such efforts could be organized around developing a replacement for
the  silicon-based  transistor,  developing  new  nanotechnology-based  devices  for  har-
vesting solar energy, or nanoscale sensors for detecting cancer.

that Ranking Member Ralph Hall is indisposed today which means

I  am  pleased  the  Committee  is  holding  this  important  hearing
today.  The  purpose  of  this  hearing  is  to  discuss  draft  reauthoriza-
tion legislation designed to improve the management and coordina-
tion  of  the  cross-agency  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  better
known  as  NNI.  Of  particular  interest  to  this  committee  is  the
prioritization  of  environmental,  health,  and  safety  research  and
communication of that research to the public.

Since  the  original  Act  was  put  in  place  in  2003,  we  have  heard
from a number of witnesses that EHS research may need to be in-
creased to ensure a steady pathway for both the nano industry suc-
cess and public acceptance of new technologies. Consequently, I am
pleased  that  the  draft  legislation  elevates  the  environmental,
health, and safety component of the NNI. At the same time, I want
to  make  sure  we  craft  policy  which  allows  for  EHS  research  to  be
embedded  into  product  development.  We  know  that  each  nano
product  and  process  may  behave  differently,  and  therefore,  inde-
pendent EHS research may not always inform a seemingly parallel
project.

I  am  also  interested  in  hearing  from  our  witnesses  about  some
of  the  proposed  changes  to  nanotechnology  education,  particularly
the changes to existing education programs at the National Science
Foundation.  Given  the  challenging  funding  environment  for  these
programs,  I  want  to  make  sure  such  changes  would  benefit  stu-
dents and classroom teachers and not eat away at other important
programs.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  insights  of  our  witnesses  on  how
we  can  strengthen  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  so  that
the United States can remain a leader in nanotechnology.

Mr.  Chairman,  with  that,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time.

time 

Thank  you  Chairman  Gordon.  I  was  pleased  to  be  an  original  co-sponsor  of  the
21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act,  which  established  our
national  nanotechnology  program  in  2003.  It  was  the  right  thing  to  do,  and  thus
far,  has  proven  to  be  successful.  I  hope  that  we  can  continue  to  work  together  to
ensure  that  the  reauthorization  of  this  vital  program  before  us  can  move  forward
in a bipartisan fashion and with bipartisan support.

This  committee  has  spent  some 

focusing  on  various  aspects  of
nanotechnology  at  the  Subcommittee  level,  much  of  which  has  been  incorporated
into the draft legislation before us today. I do not need to spend a lot of time talking
about  the  potential  benefits  and  challenges  of  nanotechnology  to  our  society.  Mr.
Chairman,  you  and  I,  as  Co-Chairs  of  the  Nanotechnology  Caucus  and  as  Members
of this committee for many years, are well aware of them, and I am certain our wit-
nesses  may  have  a  point  or  two  to  make  about  them  as  well.  Suffice  it  to  say,  de-
spite  its  name,  this  is  no  small  issue.  Our  scientists  are  using  nanotechnology  to
help create clean, secure affordable energy; low-cost filters to provide clean drinking
water;  medical  devices  and  drugs;  sensors  to  detect  and  identify  harmful  chemical
and  biological  agents;  and  techniques  to  clean  up  hazardous  chemicals  in  the  envi-
ronment. And this is just the beginning of the list.

I recognize that as these nanotechnologies are being developed, we have a respon-
sibility  to  mitigate  potential  environmental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  risks,  as  we
do  with  any  new  technology.  This  work  is  currently  being  done  and  as  long  as  the
need is there, agencies should continue to fund EHS research, but it should not nec-
essarily  take  precedence  over  or  be  funded  at  the  expense  of  the  other  component
areas  identified  in  the  strategic  plan.  My  main  interest,  as  we  move  forward  with
this bill, is to make sure that we are careful to allow a multi-agency program, which
seems  to  be  working  well,  to  continue  to  have  the  flexibility  needed  to  do  its  work
without  being  too  prescriptive.  We  can  tweak  it  a  bit,  but  we  certainly  do  not  need

to  fix  something  that  is  not  broken  and,  in  fact,  serves  as  a  good  model  for  how  an
interagency program should work.

We  have  before  us  a  well-rounded  and  esteemed  panel  of  experts  with  different
interests  in  nanotechnology,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  their  views  on  this  bill
and on ways that we can work to make improvements to it.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Ehlers follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

Thank  you  Chairman  Gordon.  I  am  pleased  that  the  Committee  is  holding  this

important hearing today.

The purpose of this hearing is to discuss draft reauthorization legislation designed
to  improve  the  management  and  coordination  of  the  cross-agency  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI).  Of  particular  interest  to  this  committee  is  the
prioritization  of  environmental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  research  and  communica-
tion of that research to the public.

Since  the  original  Act  was  put  in  place  in  2003,  we  have  heard  from  a  number
of  witnesses  that  EHS  research  may  need  to  be  increased  to  ensure  a  steady  path-
way  for  both  the  nano-industry  success  and  public  acceptance  of  new  technologies.
Consequently,  I  am  pleased  that  the  draft  legislation  elevates  the  EHS  component
of  the  NNI.  At  the  same  time,  I  want  to  make  sure  we  craft  policy  which  allows
for  EHS  research  to  be  embedded  into  product  development.  We  know  that  each
nano-product  and  process  may  behave  differently,  and  therefore  independent  EHS
research may not always inform a seemingly parallel project.

I  am  also  interested  in  hearing  from  our  witnesses  about  some  of  the  proposed
changes to nanotechnology education, particularly the changes to existing education
programs  at  the  National  Science  Foundation.  Given  the  challenging  funding  envi-
ronment  for  these  programs,  I  want  to  make  sure  such  changes  would  benefit  stu-
dents and classroom teachers and not eat away at other important programs.

I look forward to hearing the insights of our witnesses on how we can strengthen
the National Nanotechnology Initiative so that the United States can remain a lead-
er in nanotechnology. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Ehlers. It has come to my at-
tention that Mr. Honda, former and valued Member of the Science
Committee, is in the audience; and I would ask unanimous consent
that Mr. Honda be allowed to join this hearing if he so chooses, and
you’re welcome to take a seat here. I would also remind Mr. Honda
as  he  remembers  from  being  a  Member  of  the  Committee  that  the
current  Members  will  have  precedence  in  terms  of  asking  ques-
tions,  but  we  certainly  want  his  expertise  and  we  are  glad  that  he
is  here  to  join  us.  If  there  is  no  objection,  Mr.  Honda  will  join  us.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to extend a special, warm welcome to Dr. Rob-

ert R. Doering, who is with Texas Instruments.

T.I. is a power player in Texas and throughout the Nation.
In  addition  to  their  nanotechnology  research  and  semiconductor  industry  promi-

nence, T.I. is a good neighbor.

The  company  has  worked  hard  to  reach  out  to  schools  in  Dallas.  By  providing
extra  attention  to  students  in  under-served  areas,  T.I.  has  brought  up  test  scores
and generated interest in high-tech careers among our young people.

That’s good citizenship.
So,  I  want  to  commend  industry  for  its  role  in  educating  tomorrow’s  high-tech

workforce.

During previous hearings held by this committee, the witnesses, who represented
the  Federal  Government,  industry,  and  educational  institutions  and  science  edu-
cators  at  all  levels,  agreed  that  nanotechnology  education  is  an  important  compo-
nent of a strategy to capitalize on the promise of this advancing field.

Witnesses  discussed  the  importance  of  early  nanotechnology  education  for  gener-

ating enthusiasm among young students and the general public.

They  were  unanimous  in  their  support  for  increasing  formal  education  in
nanotechnology beginning at the undergraduate level, including at two-year colleges
because of their important role in developing a skilled workforce.

I  will  be  interested  to  hear  how  best  to  allocate  our  resources,  as  this  committee

works to reauthorize the National Nanotechnology Initiative.

To  me,  it  seems  that  the  priority  should  be  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  domestic

workforce in place. That, Mr. Chairman, begins with educational activities.

Again, I want to welcome today’s witnesses and thank the Chairman and Ranking

Member for holding today’s hearing.

I yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The  advanced  development  of  nanoscale  technology  has  the  potential  to  impact

virtually every sector of our economy as well as our daily lives.

Here in the United States, we are currently the leader in nanotechnology research
and development. However, we must continue to protect and ensure U.S. leadership
in nanotechnology R&D.

The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  has  played  a  vital  role  in  sup-

porting nanotechnology activities in 25 federal agencies.

However, as this committee has found, it is essential to ensure that the NNI con-

tinues to focus on modern issues facing nanotechnology development today.

As  a  former  teacher  for  almost  30  years,  I  strongly  support  enhancing  K–16
nanotechnology-related education programs. As we addressed in the America COM-
PETES  Act,  it  is  critical  to  ensure  that  our  workforce  is  educated  and  prepared  to
continue to lead in nanotechnology R&D.

I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses.
I yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce  our
witnesses.  First,  Mr.  Floyd  Kvamme  is  the  Co-Chair  of  the  Presi-
dent’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology.  Mr.  Sean
Murdock  is  the  Executive  Director  for  the  NanoBusiness  Alliance.
Dr. Joseph Krajcik is the Associate Dean of Research and Professor
of Education at the University of Michigan. Mr. Ehlers, I hope you
will be happy about that. Dr. Andrew Maynard is the Chief Science
Advisor for the Project of Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Wood-
row  Wilson  Center  for  Scholars.  Dr.  Raymond  David  is  the  Man-
ager  of  Toxicology  at  BASF  Corporation  and  is  also  representing
the  American  Chemistry  Council.  Finally,  Dr.  Robert  Doering.  Dr.
Doering  is  a  Senior  Fellow  and  Research  Strategy  Manager  at
Texas  Instruments  and  is  also  representing  the  Semiconductor  In-
dustry Association. Thank you for joining us today, and we have a
very distinguished panel at this point. We will open our first round
of  questions—excuse  me.  I  guess  we  should  hear  from  our  wit-
nesses, shouldn’t we? Let us begin.
STATEMENT  OF  MR.  E.  FLOYD  KVAMME,  CO-CHAIR,  PRESI-
DENT’S  COUNCIL  OF  ADVISORS  ON  SCIENCE  AND  TECH-
NOLOGY
Mr.  KVAMME.  My  name  is  Floyd  Kvamme.  I  am  Co-Chair  of  the
President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a high-
level group from academia, industry, and other entities experienced
in  leading  successful  science  and  technology  enterprises.  My  re-
marks today are my own, but I am confident that my fellow PCAST
members feel similarly on the issues under discussion.

Last  week,  PCAST  released  its  second  review  of  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative, or NNI, and I’d like to reference that re-
port  in  full  for  this  hearing’s  record,  as  it  includes  a  detailed  as-
sessment  of  NNI  program  activities  and  coordination  developed
through extensive review over the last 18 months.

We  are  here  today  to  talk  about  the  NNI  and  the  Committee’s
draft  legislation  to  reauthorize  this  important  program.  What  is
nanotechnology?  If  one  drops  the  nano  part  of  the  word,  we  are
talking  about  technology.  Technology  today  invades  every  part  of
our  economy,  not  only  computers  and  communications,  but  health
care,  energy,  transportation,  education,  and  in  a  word,  everything.
As a result, a technology initiative is about a very wide and varied
range  of  industries  and  applications.  Nanotechnology  is  simply  the
continuing  development  of  technology  to  applications  which  take
advantage  of  the  unique  properties  of  some  materials  and  is  being
applied  in  all  of  the  applications  mentioned  above  and  will,  un-
doubtedly, make many of the products in these applications better,
either in performance, cost or both.

Establishment  of  the  NNI  was  a  very  good  idea.  I  commend  the
Congress and this committee for authorizing this initiative in 2003.
In  both  our  first  report  in  2005  and  now  our  second  one,  we  have
had  to  deal  not  only  with  the  diversity  that  is  nanotechnology  but
also  a  wide  range  of  federal  agencies  involved  in  supporting  and/
or conducting nano R&D. The initiative did not set up a new agen-
cy  with  a  specific  budget;  rather,  it  set  up  coordination,  planning,
and  review  mechanisms  intended  to  ensure  individual  agency  ac-
tivities  in  nanotechnology  are  effectively  supporting  program  and
government-wide goals. The legislation formally established the co-
ordinating office which raises its budget through contributions from
the  various  agencies  with  nanotechnology  R&D  budgets.  Agencies
with  primarily  regulatory  missions  have  also  taken  an  active  role
in  the  initiative  and  have  contributed  to  its  activities.  This  strong
and  interagency  coordination,  a  premier  example  of  any  such  Fed-
eral  R&D  initiative,  has  been  central  to  the  success  to  date  of  the
NNI.

Appropriate and informed support for environmental, health and
safety  (EHS),  research  within  the  NNI  is  an  important  responsi-
bility  that  demands  strong  coordination.  With  respect  to  EHS,
PCAST  has  found  that  the  NNI’s  approach  has  been  sound;  the
interagency  coordination  process  identified  EHS  research  needs,
mapped  those  needs  to  current  activities  to  identify  potential  re-
search opportunities, and then prioritized those opportunities to in-
form budget and planning activities.

The provision of the draft reauthorizing legislation that the NNI
collectively allocate a minimum of 10 percent of its nanotechnology
R&D  to  EHS-related  research  is,  however,  problematic  in  both
practice  and  principle.  In  practice  the  funding  of  each  agency  is
independent  of  the  NNI.  The  NSET  subcommittee  provides  the
base  for  coordinating  member  agency  activities  and  planning  ef-
forts, but it does not direct NNI funding. Further, it is not reason-
able  to  exclusively  designate  projects  or  portions  of  projects  as  ex-
clusively  EHS  or  not.  The  reporting  structure  of  the  NNI  by  PCAs
enables characterization and analysis of the research portfolio that
is  sufficient  for  policy  and  planning  purposes.  The  current  funding
mechanisms and structure makes it difficult for me to see how this
minimum funding across the program is practical. In principle, the
set-aside  appears  to  be  arbitrary  and  not  based  on  a  sound  sci-
entific analysis of the NNI portfolio of relevant research, including
extensive  relevant  research  not  reported  in  the  EHS  component

area  and  what  is  strategically  needed.  Instead,  support  should  be
guided  by  the  identified  gaps  in  sequential  priorities  identified  in
the EHS research strategy. Like all other aspects of the NNI, EHS
research funding decisions should be determined by identified R&D
directives  as  is  currently  the  approach  of  the  agencies  within  the
NNI. Scientifically determined, strategically planned priorities, not
arbitrary  percentages,  should  guide  funding  for  all  nanotechnology
research.

With  respect  to  the  oversight  provisions,  the  breadth  and  depth
of  the  high-level  experience  of  the  PCAST  and  its  role  as  the  Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Advisory  Panel,  combined  with  a  detailed
expertise of the ad hoc technology advisory group, has worked quite
well  the  last  five  years  in  providing  functional  oversight  for  the
NNI  and  directly  advising  the  President  on  nanotechnology.  The
proposed  bill  should  maximize  the  flexibility  for  the  next  Adminis-
tration  in  establishing  its  own  advisory  structure.  As  the  current
PCAST  prepares  to  pass  the  baton  to  the  next  administration,  we
will  suggest  they  incorporate  a  similar  approach  to  oversight,
leveraging the expertise of a large technical advisory group, wheth-
er they be within PCAST or separate.

clear 

research.  A 

strategy  has  been  developed 

In summary, the NNI as currently structured is a productive and
effective  program  and  a  model  of  interagency  coordination.  Our
newly  released  report  makes  recommendations  for  improvement
but  finds  the  program  basically  sound.  Industry  is  benefiting  from
its 
for
nanotechnology-related  EHS  research,  and  EHS  guidelines  are
being presented to guide industry. International cooperation is hap-
pening.  The  Coordinating  Office  and  NNI  participating  agencies
have  responded  to  past  recommendations  from  PCAST  as  well  as
the National Academies and have strengthened the program. Agen-
cies  participate  voluntarily  because  they  derive  benefit  from  doing
so.  A  reauthorization  that  avoids  overly  prescriptive  guidance,  like
an  arbitrary  EHS  funding  floor,  and  bureaucratic  micro-manage-
ment,  such  as  costly  database  requirements,  will  further  strength-
en and promote interagency coordination that has been vital to the
success of the NNI to date. This approach would confirm the goals
as  presented  in  the  original  legislation  and  commend  the  agencies
for  their  coordinated  efforts  to  maintain  the  leadership  and  com-
petitiveness of the U.S. in nanotechnology.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF E. FLOYD KVAMME

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to testify today. My
name  is  Floyd  Kvamme.  I  am  Co-Chair  of  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on
Science and Technology (or PCAST). PCAST comprises a high-level group from aca-

view,  I  am  confident  that  my  fellow  PCAST  members  feel  similarly  on  the  issues
under discussion today.

Last week, PCAST released its second review of the National Nanotechnology Ini-
tiative  (or  the  NNI),  and  I’d  like  to  reference  that  report  in  full  for  this  hearing’s

We  are  here  today  to  talk  about  the  NNI  and  the  Committee’s  draft  legislation
to  reauthorize  this  important  interagency  research  and  development  (R&D)  pro-
gram.  Let  me  begin  by  giving  you  my  view  of  what  nanotechnology  is.  If  one  drops
the  ‘nano’  part  of  the  word,  we  are  talking  about  ‘technology.’  Technology  today  in-
vades  virtually  every  part  of  our  economy.  It’s  not  only  computers  and  communica-
tions,  but  health  care,  energy,  transportation,  education,  and—in  a  word—every-
thing.  As  a  result,  in  talking  about  a  ‘‘technology  initiative,’’  we  are  talking  about
a very wide and varied range of industries and applications. Nanotechnology is sim-
ply  the  continuing  development  of  technology  to  applications  which  take  advantage
of  the  unique  properties  of  some  materials  engineered  at  the  nanoscale.
Nanotechnology is being applied in virtually all of the applications mentioned above
and  will,  undoubtedly,  make  many  of  the  products  in  these  applications  better—ei-
ther in performance, cost or both. We should not think of some narrow range of ap-
plications for nanotechnology, but rather a vast array of potential uses.

Establishment  of  the  NNI  was  a  very  good  idea.  I  commend  the  great  work  of
Congress and this committee for formally authorizing this initiative in 2003. In both
our  first  report  in  2005  and  now  our  second  one  released  last  week,  we  have  had
to  deal  not  only  with  the  diversity  that  is  nanotechnology  but  also  a  wide  range  of
federal agencies involved in supporting and/or conducting nano R&D. Appropriately,
the  initiative  did  not  set  up  a  new  agency  with  a  specific  budget;  rather,  it  set  up
coordination, planning, and review mechanisms intended to ensure individual agen-
cy activities in nanotechnology are effectively supporting program- and government-
wide  goals.  I  believe  recognizing  this  is  important  and  instructive  with  respect  to
the  draft  legislation,  and  I’ll  get  to  that  in  a  few  moments.  The  legislation  did  for-
mally establish the coordinating office which raises its budget through contributions
from  the  various  agencies  with  nanotechnology  R&D  budgets.  Agencies  with  pri-
marily regulatory missions have also taken an active role in the initiative and have
contributed  to  its  activities.  This  strong  and  deep  interagency  coordination—a  pre-
mier  example  of  any  such  Federal  R&D  initiative—has  been  central  to  the  success
to date of the NNI.

At  the  same  time,  the  agencies  have  specific  missions  and  objective  to  address.
For example, appropriate and informed support for environmental, health and safe-
ty  (EHS)  research  within  the  NNI  is  an  important  responsibility  that  demands
strong coordination. With respect to this issue PCAST has found that the NNI’s ap-
proach  has  been  sound;  the  interagency  coordination  process  identified  EHS  re-
search needs, mapped those needs to current activities to identify potential research
opportunities,  and  then  prioritized  those  opportunities  to  inform  budget  and  plan-
ning  activities.  For  example,  I  refer  you  to  page  49  of  the  recently-released  NNI
Strategy  for  Nanotechnology-Related  Environmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Research
(full report available at http://www.nano.gov/NNI¥EHS¥Research¥Strategy.pdf):

In  this  document  the  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering,  and  Technology  Sub-
committee’s  working  group  on  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implica-
tions  (or  NEHI)  has  developed  five  critical  areas  for  EHS  research.  The  agencies
agreed to cooperate such that while there was a lead agency for each task, the other
agencies  contribute  to  the  overall  goals  agreed  to  within  the  NNI.  These  efforts  do
not  take  away  from  the  other  work  within  the  agencies  to  perform  their  mission-
oriented  functions  but,  in  our  view,  lead  to  more  effective  activity  within  the  lead
agency.  I  point  specifically  to  the  reports  and  activities  of  NIOSH,  EPA,  FDA,  and
NIST  (detailed  on  page  27  in  our  PCAST  report)  as  examples  of  agency  specific  ac-
tivity:

• The  OSTP  and  the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  issued  in  No-
vember  2007  a  memorandum  identifying  principles  for  nanotechnology  envi-
ronmental health and safety oversight based on interagency consensus.1

• The  National  Institute  of  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH)  issued  a
call in July 2006 for information in Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology2 invit-
ing expert feedback from private industry and other government entities, and
in June 2007 it issued the report Progress Toward Safe Nanotechnology in the
Workplace.3

• The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  produced  in  February  2007  a
white  paper4
to
nanotechnology  EHS  research,  followed  in  February  2008  by  a  nanomaterial
research strategy.5 The agency also has launched a Voluntary Nanoscale Ma-
terials stewardship program.

opers of nanotechnology-enabled products under its jurisdiction.

The provision in the draft reauthorizing legislation that the NNI collectively allo-
cate  a  minimum  of  10  percent  of  its  nanotechnology  R&D  to  EHS-related  research
is problematic in both practice and principle:

• In  practice,  the  funding  of  each  agency  is  fundamentally  independent  of  the
NNI. The NSET Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Coun-
cil  provides  the  base  for  coordinating  NNI  member  agencies  activities  and
planning  efforts,  but  it  does  not  direct  NNI  funding.  Furthermore,  it  is  not
feasible or reasonable to exclusively designate projects (or portions of projects)
as  exclusively  ‘‘EHS’’  or  not.  The  current  reporting  structure  of  the  NNI  by
Program  Component  Areas  or  PCAs  enables  characterization  and  analysis  of
the research portfolio that is sufficient for policy and planning purposes. The
current  funding  mechanisms  and  structure  of  the  NNI  makes  it  difficult  for
me  to  see  how  this  ‘‘minimum  funding’’  across  the  program  is  either  reason-
able, necessary, or, indeed, practical.
• In  principle,  this  set-aside  appears  to  be  arbitrary  and  not  based  on  a  sound
scientific analysis of the current NNI portfolio of relevant research (including
extensive  relevant  research  not  reported  under  the  EHS  program  component
area)  and  what  is  strategically  needed.  Instead,  support  should  be  guided  by
the 
in  the  NNI’s
nanotechnology  EHS  research  strategy.  Like  all  other  aspects  of  the  NNI,
EHS  research  funding  decisions  should  be  determined  by  identified  R&D  ob-
jectives,  as  is  currently  the  approach  of  the  agencies  within  the  NNI.  Sci-
entifically-determined,  strategically-planned  priorities—not  arbitrary
percentages—should  guide  funding  for  all  nanotechnology  research,
including research relevant to EHS.

identified  gaps  and  sequential  priorities 

identified 

It  is  important  to  note  that  funding  for  nano-related  EHS  research  has  doubled
since  2005.  As  industry  picks  up  more  applications  research,  the  Federal  Govern-
ment’s role will change and is already changing to work more in the EHS and regu-
latory  areas.  EHS  funding  will  probably  continue  to  increase.  The  one  area  where
funding  is  accelerating—perhaps  tied  to  our  recommendations—is  in  worker  safety
where we will propose in our upcoming letter on the EHS report that NIOSH spend-
ing  accelerate.  The  reason  worker  spending  is  so  critical  is  that  in  many  instances,
nanomaterials—while  in  nano  form  in  the  workplace—stop  being  nanomaterials
after production and become a tightly, chemically bound part of a larger system.

With  respect  to  the  oversight  provisions  in  the  proposed  reauthorization,  the
breadth  and  depth  of  high-level  expertise  of  the  PCAST  in  its  role  as  the  National
Nanotechnology  Advisory  Panel  combined  with  the  detailed  expertise  of  the  ad  hoc
Technical  Advisory  Group  has  worked  quite  well  the  past  five  years  in  providing
functional  oversight 
for  the  NNI  and  directly  advising  the  President  on
nanotechnology.  The  proposed  bill  should  maximize  the  flexibility  for  the  next  Ad-
ministration  in  establishing  its  own  advisory  structure.  As  the  current  PCAST  pre-
pares to pass the baton to the next administration, we will suggest they incorporate
a  similar  approach  to  oversight,  leveraging  the  expertise  of  a  large  technical  advi-
sory group, whether they be within PCAST or separate.

With  respect  to  overcoming  barriers  to  commercialization  and  facilitating  tech
transfer,  again  I  refer  to  the  report  of  the  PCAST  review  of  the  NNI.  The  NNI’s
unparalleled  infrastructure  of  centers,  networks,  and  user  facilities  is  working  very
well,  geographically  distributed  and  with  a  wide  array  of  expertise.  These  facilities
are serving their purposes well based on all inputs we have received from both our
TAG  members  and  personal  experience.  Furthermore,  the  NNI  already  supports
‘‘large-scale research and development projects’’ on problems of national importance,
for example, in energy and biomedicine. The National Cancer Institute, for example,
supports  a  five-year,  $144  million  program  developing  nanotechnology  for  cancer
diagnostics and therapeutics that involves eight centers and over 400 investigators.
With  respect  to  overall  funding,  the  NNI  seems  well  funded  in  balance  to  other
programs in the S&T budget. PCAST had hoped that the America COMPETES Act
funding would have been passed and will continue to support those priorities of this
Congress.

In  summary,  the  NNI  as  currently  structured  is  a  very  productive  and  effective
program and a model of interagency coordination. Our newly released report makes
recommendations  for  improvement  but  finds  the  program  basically  sound.  Industry
is  benefiting  from 
its  research.  A  clear  strategy  has  been  developed  for
nanotechnology-related  EHS  research,  and  EHS  guidelines  are  being  presented  to
guide

Nanotechnology Coordinating Office and NNI participating agencies have responded
to past recommendations from PCAST as well as the Academies and have strength-
ened the program. Agencies participate voluntarily because they derive benefit from

doing so. A heavy-handed reauthorization with overly prescriptive guidance (like an
arbitrary  EHS  funding  floor)  and  bureaucratic  micro-management  (such  as  costly
database  requirements)  will  weaken  and  inhibit  the  interagency  coordination  that
is  vital  to  the  success  of  the  NNI  to  date.  Rather,  this  reauthorization  should  be
an opportunity to strengthen and support the interagency coordination founding the
NNI,  confirming  the  goals  as  presented  in  the  original  legislation  and  commending
the  agencies  for  their  coordinated  efforts  to  maintain  the  leadership  and  competi-
tiveness of the U.S. in nanotechnology.

Executive Summary of

The National Nanotechnology Initiative: Second Assessment
and  Recommendations  of  the  National  Nanotechnology
Advisory Panel

(APRIL 2008)

The  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  of  2003  (Public
Law  108–153)  calls  for  a  National  Nanotechnology  Advisory  Panel  (NNAP)  to  peri-
odically  review  the  federal  nanotechnology  research  and  development  (R&D)  pro-
gram  known  as  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI).  The  President’s
Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) is designated by Executive
Order  to  serve  as  the  NNAP.  This  report  is  the  second  NNAP  review  of  the  NNI,
updating the first assessment published in 2005.

Including  the  NNI  budget  request  for  fiscal  year  (FY)  2009  of  $1.5  billion,  the
total NNI investment since its inception in 2001 is nearly $10 billion. The total an-
nual  global  investment  in  nanotechnology  is  an  estimated  $13.9  billion,  divided
roughly equally among the United States, Europe, and Asia. Industry analysis sug-
gests  that  private  investment  has  been  out-pacing  that  of  government  since  about
2006.  The  activities,  balance,  and  management  of  the  NNI  among  the  25  partici-
pating  U.S.  agencies  and  the  efforts  to  coordinate  with  stakeholders  from  outside
the Federal Government, including industry and other governments, are the subject
of this report.

The  first  report  answered  four  questions:  How  are  we  doing?  Is  the  money  well
spent  and  the  program  well  managed?  Are  we  addressing  societal  concerns  and  po-
tential  risks?  How  can  we  do  better?  That  report  was  generally  positive  in  its  con-
clusions but provided recommendations for improving or strengthening efforts in the
following  areas:  technology  transfer;  environmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  re-
search  and  its  coordination;  education  and  workforce  preparation;  and  societal  di-
mensions.

Since the first report, increasing attention has been focused on the potential risks
of  nanotechnology,  especially  the  possible  harm  to  human  health  and  the  environ-
ment from nanomaterials. In this second assessment, the NNAP paid special atten-
tion to the NNI efforts in these areas. During its review, the NNAP obtained input
from  various  sources.  It  convened  a  number  of  expert  panels  and  consulted  its
nanotechnology  Technical  Advisory  Group  (nTAG)  and  the  President’s  Council  on
Bioethics. NNI member agencies and the National Nanotechnology Coordination Of-
fice (NNCO) also provided valuable information.
The NNAP finds that the United States remains a leader in nanotechnology
based on various metrics, including R&D expenditures and outputs such as pub-
lications,  citations,  and  patents.  However,  taken  as  a  region,  the  European  Union
has  more  publications,  and  China’s  output  is  increasing.  There  are  many  examples
of NNI-funded research results that are moving into commercial applications. How-
ever, measures of technology transfer and the commercial impact of nanotechnology
as  a  whole  are  not  readily  available,  in  part  because  of  the  difficulty  in  defining
what is, and is not, a ‘‘nanotechnology-based product.’’
The NNAP commends and encourages the ongoing NNI investment in infra-
structure  and  instrumentation.  Leading-edge  nanoscale  research  often  requires
advanced equipment and facilities. The NNI investment in over 81 centers and user
facilities  across  the  country  that  provide  broad  access  to  costly  instrumentation,
state-of-the-art  facilities,  and  technical  expertise  has  been  enormously  important
and successful. These facilities, which have been funded by many different agencies
in  order  to  address  a  variety  of  missions,  support  a  diverse  range  of  academic,  in-
dustry,  and  government  research.  In  addition,  the  NNI  investment  has  been  used
to  leverage  additional  support  by  universities,  State  governments,  and  the  private
sector.
Advances in nanotechnology are embodied in a growing number of applica-
tions  and  products  in  various  industries.  Many  early  applications  have  been
more  evolutionary  than  revolutionary.  However,  research  funded  by  the  NNI  today
has  the  potential  for  innovations  that  are  paradigm  shifting,  for  example  in  energy
and  medicine.  As  with  any  emerging  technology,  there  is  potential  for  unintended
consequences  or  uses  that  may  prove  harmful  to  health  or  the  environment  or  that
may  have  other  societal  implications.  The  NNAP  notes  that  existing  regulations

apply  to  nanotechnology-based  products,  and  those  who  make  or  sell  such  products
have responsibilities regarding workplace and product safety. As in 2005, the NNAP
believes that the greatest risk of exposure to nanomaterials at present is to workers
who  manufacture  or  handle  such  materials.  However,  environmental,  health,  and
safety  risks  in  a  wide  range  of  settings  must  be  identified  and  the  necessary  re-
search performed so that real risks can be appropriately addressed.
The NNAP views the approach for addressing EHS research under the NNI
as  sound.  The  recent  reports  by  the  interagency  Nanotechnology  Environmental
and  Health  Implications  (NEHI)  Working  Group  are  good  steps  by  the  NNI  to
prioritize  needed  EHS  research  and  to  coordinate  EHS  activity  across  the  Federal
Government.  The  NNAP  feels  that  calls  for  a  separate  agency  or  office  devoted  to
nanotechnology  EHS  research  or  to  set  aside  a  fixed  percentage  of  the  budget  for
EHS research are misguided and may have the unintended consequence of reducing
research on beneficial applications and on risk.
In addition to EHS implications, the NNAP considered ethical and other societal as-
pects  of  nanotechnology.  In  consultation  with  the  President’s  Council  on  Bio-
ethics, the panel concluded that at present, nanotechnology does not raise
ethical  concerns  that  are  unique  to  the  field.  Rather,  concerns  over  implica-
tions  for  privacy  and  for  equality  of  access  to  benefits  are  similar  to  concerns  over
technological advances in general. This finding does not diminish the importance of
continued dialogue and research on the societal aspects of nanotechnology.
Overall, the members of the NNAP feel that the NNI continues to be a high-
ly  successful  model  for  an  interagency  program;  it  is  well  organized  and
well  managed.  The  structure  of  the  interagency  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering,
and  Technology  (NSET)  Subcommittee  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology
Council  effectively  coordinates  the  breadth  of  nanotechnology  activities  across  the
Federal  Government.  The  NSET  working  groups  target  functional  areas  in  which
additional  focus  is  required.  The  NNCO  provides  important  support  that  is  a  key
to  the  success  of  the  program.  The  Strategic  Plan  updated  in  2007  clearly  commu-
nicates  the  goals  and  priorities  for  the  initiative  and  includes  actions  for  achieving
progress.  With  the  separation  in  the  updated  plan  of  EHS  research  from  that  on
other  societal  dimensions,  the  NNAP  finds  the  Program  Component  Areas  (PCAs)
that  are  defined  for  purposes  of  tracking  programs  and  investments  serve  the  NNI
well.

The  NNAP  has  a  number  of  recommendations  for  strengthening  the  NNI,  which

are grouped into six areas.
1. Infrastructure,  management,  and  coordination.  The  NNAP  feels  that  the
substantial infrastructure of multi-disciplinary centers, user facilities, along with in-
strumentation,  equipment,  and  technical  expertise,  is  vital  to  continued  U.S.  com-
petitiveness in nanotechnology and should be maintained. Whereas the NNAP finds
the coordination and management among the NNI participating agencies to be gen-
erally strong, intra-agency coordination should be improved, especially in large, seg-
mented  agencies.  The  NNI  member  agencies  should  continue  to  support  inter-
national  coordination  through  effective  international  forums,  such  as  the  Organiza-
tion  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  Such  efforts  will  aid  in
the  development  of  information  related  to  health  and  safety,  as  well  as  addressing
economic  barriers  and  impacts.  Implementing  and  monitoring  this  recommendation
should lead to more effective use of agency resources.
2. Standards development. Nanotechnology standards are necessary for activities
ranging  from  research  and  development  to  commerce  and  regulation.  Federal  agen-
cies should continue to engage in national and international standards development
activities.  The  NNI  should  maintain  a  strong  U.S.  representation  in  international
forums  and  seek  to  avoid  duplicative  standards  development  work.  Where  appro-
priate, NIST and other NNI agencies should develop reference materials, test meth-
ods, and other standards that provide broad support for industry production of safe
nanotechnology-based products.
3. Technology  transfer  and  commercialization.  The  NNI  should  continue  to
fund world-class research to promote technology transfer. Strong research programs
produce top-notch nanoscale scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, who graduate
with knowledge, skills, and innovative ideas. Such programs also have the potential
to attract more U.S. students to related fields. NNI-funded centers should be struc-
tured  to  spur  partnering  with  industry,  which  enhances  technology  transfer.  The
NNI  should  seek  means  to  assess  more  accurately  nanotechnology-related  innova-
tion  and  commercialization  of  NNI  research  results.  These  efforts  should  be  coordi-

24

nated  with  those  of  the  OECD  to  assess  economic  impact  of  nanotechnology  inter-
nationally.
4. Environmental,  health,  and  safety  implications.  The  NNAP  feels  that  the
NNI has made considerable progress since its last review in the level and coordina-
tion  of  EHS  research  for  nanomaterials.  Such  efforts  should  be  continued  and
should be coordinated with those taking place in industry and with programs funded
by other governments to avoid gaps and unnecessary duplication of work. Moreover,
EHS  research  should  be  coordinated  with,  not  segregated  from,  applications  re-
search  to  promote  risk  and  benefit  being  considered  together.  This  is  particularly
important when development and risk assessment research are taking place in par-
allel,  as  they  are  for  nanotechnology  today.  The  NNI  should  take  steps  to  make
widely  available  nonproprietary  information  about  the  properties  of  nanomaterials
and methods for risk/benefit analysis.
5. Societal  and  ethical  implications.  Research  on  the  societal  and  ethical  as-
pects of nanotechnology should be integrated with technical R&D and take place in
the  context  of  broader  societal  and  ethical  scholarship.  The  NNAP  feels  that  this
approach  will  broaden  the  range  of  perspectives  and  increase  exchange  of  views  on
topics that affect society at large.
6. Communication and outreach. The NNAP is concerned that public opinion is
susceptible  to  hype  and  exaggerated  statements—both  positive  and  negative.  The
NNI  should  be  a  trusted  source  of  information  about  nanotechnology  that  is  acces-
sible  to  a  range  of  stakeholders,  including  the  public.  The  NNI  should  expand  out-
reach  and  communication  activities  by  the  NNCO  and  the  Nanotechnology  Public
Engagement  and  Communications  Working  Group  and  by  coordinating  existing
agency  communication  efforts.  To  enhance  effectiveness,  the  information  should  be
developed with broad input and through processes that incorporate two-way commu-
nication with the intended audiences.

This review complements an assessment by the National Research Council (NRC)
of  the  National  Academies.  The  NNAP  agrees  with  many  of  the  NRC  recommenda-
tions. However, the NNAP questions the recommendation for a formal, independent
advisory  panel.  The  panel  feels  that  the  current  arrangement-whereby  the  NRC
panels of technical experts, the high-level science and technology management lead-
ers  of  PCAST,  and  the  nanotechnology  experts  on  the  nTAG  each  provide  distinct
and  useful  input  to  the  NNI  review  process—provides  a  broader  perspective  than
would a single group consisting of a smaller number of advisors.

My  name  is  Sean  Murdock,  and  I  am  the  Executive  Director  of
the  NanoBusiness  Alliance.  The  NanoBusiness  Alliance  is  the  pre-

ups,  Fortune  500  companies,  academic  research  institutions,  and
public-private  partnerships  working  to  derive  economic  develop-
ment and growth through nanotechnology.

This  wide  group  of  stakeholders  has  come  together  because  we
believe  that  nanotechnology  will  be  one  of  the  key  drivers  of  qual-
ity-of-life  improvements,  economic  growth,  and  business  success  in
the 21st century. The Alliance provides a collective voice and a ve-
hicle  for  efforts  to  advance  the  benefits  of  nanotechnology  across
our economy and society.

The  NanoBusiness  Alliance  strongly  supports  the  National

Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008 as drafted.

in 

This  committee  has  long  recognized  that  nanotechnology  is  one
of the most important frontiers of science and technology, and that
nanotechnology has the potential to dramatically improve our qual-
ity  of  life,  our  health,  our  environment,  and  our  economy.  The  Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  which  this  committee  led  Con-
gress  in  authorizing  in  2003,  provided  the  framework  for  coordi-
nated  federal  research  and  development.  That  authorization  bill,
the  21st  Century  Nanotech  R&D  Act,  focused  on  fundamental
nanotechnology research.

Now,  five  years  later,  it  is  time  to  reauthorize  and  update  this
legislation.  Much  has 
the  past  half-decade;
nanotechnology  is  beginning  to  move  from  the  laboratory  to  the
store shelf.

changed 

American  nanotechnology  companies  are  beginning  to  shift  from
prototype development to large-scale manufacturing. Employers are
beginning  to  look  for  nanotechnology-qualified  workers.  And  the
public is beginning to take notice of nanotechnology, with its many
benefits  and  some  potential  risks,  which  need  to  be  examined  and
managed.

That  the  landscape  has  changed  so  much  in  five  years  is  in  no
small  part  due  to  the  success  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Ini-
tiative  itself.  But  its  success  at 
jump-starting  the  Nation’s
nanotechnology  development  means  that  the  Initiative  now  needs
to be updated to reflect five years of growth.

We  are  pleased  that  the  Committee  has  thought  carefully  about
how  best  to  bring  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  up  to
date.  The  draft  legislation  will  improve  the  Initiative’s  capabilities
in  several  key  areas,  including  translational  research  and  develop-
ment  for  commercialization,  nanotechnology  education,  and  envi-
ronmental, health, and safety research.

As  the  Members  of  this  committee  know,  America  faces  intense
global  competition  in  every  field.  But  nowhere  is  this  competition
more  intense  than  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology.  Its  economic  de-
velopment  potential  has  led  countries  across  Europe  and  Asia  to
make  large  and  strategic  investments  in  nanotechnology  research
and  development.  The  stated  goal  of  many  of  these  countries  is  to
dominate  one  or  more  sectors  and  change  their  geopolitical  posi-
tion.  Russia  has  announced  a  $7  billion  nanotechnology  initiative
that  will  spend  nearly  $750  million  more  on  nanotechnology  re-
search  each  year  than  the  United  States.  China  is  investing,  on  a
purchasing  power  parity  basis,  approximately  $1  billion  and  grow-
ing rapidly.

The  United  States  continues  to  lead  the  world  in  fundamental
nanotechnology research, but over the last five years we have seen
our foreign competitors demonstrate that they are becoming equal-
ly  capable  of  commercializing  nanotechnology.  We  must  reverse
this  trend.  While  we  cannot  and  should  not  adopt  our  competitors’
model  of  direct  state  investment  in  private  companies,  we  can  and
should  take  steps  to  ensure  that  innovative  American  companies
have unfettered access to American research and that they are able
to  commercialize  that  research  efficiently  and  effectively.  We
should  encourage  programs  such  as  the  SBIR,  the  STTR  program,
and  the  Technology  Innovation  Program.  We  should  focus  our  ef-
forts on goal-oriented research in areas of national importance. And
we should do everything we can to see that federal, state, and pri-
vate  resources  are  working  together  to  bring  these  technologies  to
market.

legislation  does  this.  It  retools  the  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative  to  focus  more  on  applied  research  while
maintaining  a  commitment  to  fundamental  research.  It  supports
large-scale collaborative efforts to develop nanotechnology solutions
to  key  public  policy  challenges  such  as  energy  efficiency,  environ-
mental  cleanup,  and  health  care.  And  it  updates  the  Initiative  to
include  databases  and  other  information-sharing  mechanisms  that
actually help companies and the public understand what resources
and opportunities to engage in are available.

The  draft 

The  NanoBusiness  Alliance  is  firmly  committed  to  advancing
nanotechnology  education.  We  cannot  expect  to  compete  in  the
global  economy  if  we  are  not  generating  nanotechnology-literate
students  who  will  go  on  to  become  leaders  and  workers  in  the
nanotechnology  economy  of  the  future.  We  need  to  inspire  Amer-
ican students to choose science tracks in high school and then pro-
vide  them  with  hands-on  nanotechnology  opportunities  in  colleges
and technical colleges.

As it stands, we are educating foreign students and then sending
them  home  to  compete  against  us.  According  to  the  NSF,  foreign
students  on  temporary  visas  earned  32  percent  of  all  science  and
engineering  doctorates  awarded  in  the  United  States  in  the  last
year  for  which  data  is  available.  Foreign  students  earned  55  per-
cent  of  engineering  doctorates.  Many  of  these  students  will  ulti-
mately return home. We must develop more domestic scientific tal-
ent if we are to lead in nanotechnology commercialization over the
long  haul.  We  believe  that  inspiration  and  inquiry-driven  learning
are key to accomplishing that.

The Alliance supports putting nanotechnology tools in the hands
of  students  in  community  colleges  and  campuses  so  that  they  can
see first-hand what nanotechnology is and why it is important. The
Alliance  also  supports  integrating  local  nanotechnology  businesses
into  the  program,  and  many  of  our  members  are  already  reaching
out to schools to do that.

terms  of  environmental  health  and  safety  research,
nanotechnology  has  tremendous  potential  benefits  for  the  environ-
ment,  health  and  safety.  But  as  we  develop  nanotechnology  appli-
cations, we must do so responsibly, identifying and addressing any
risks  or  hazards  associated  with  nanotechnology  before  it  causes
environmental,  health,  or  safety  problems.  The  Alliance  has  called

gram, and this legislation does that.

The  NanoBusiness  Alliance  believes  that  the  environmental,
health,  and  safety  research  should  be  fully  funded  and  based  on  a
clear,  carefully-constructed  research  strategy.  While  we  believe
that  10  percent  of  the  total  funding  for  nanotechnology  research
and development is a reasonable estimate of the resources that will
be  required  to  execute  the  plan,  we  also  believe  that  actual  re-
source  levels  should  be  driven  by  the  strategic  plan,  as  they  will
vary significantly across agencies.

The  Alliance  appreciates  the  Committee’s  commitment  to  devel-
oping  a  broader  understanding  of  nanotechnology  before  erecting
an extensive new regulatory structure. We hope that Congress will
see  the  wisdom  of  the  Committee’s  approach  and  will  use  the  re-
search  authorized  by  this  bill  as  a  basis  for  deciding  what,  if  any-
thing, is needed.

I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  once  again  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  and  its  leadership  on  this  issue.  Thank  you  very
much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SEAN MURDOCK

Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall, and Members of the House Committee
on  Science  and  Technology,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify
on the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008.

My name is Sean Murdock, and I am the Executive Director of the NanoBusiness
Alliance. The NanoBusiness Alliance is the nanotechnology industry association and
the  premier  nanotechnology  policy  and  commercialization  advocacy  group  in  the
United States.

NanoBusiness Alliance members span multiple stakeholder groups and traditional
industrial  sectors,  including  newly  formed  start-ups,  Fortune  500  companies,  aca-
demic  research  institutions,  and  public-private  partnerships  working  to  derive  eco-
nomic development and growth through nanotechnology.

This  wide  group  of  stakeholders  has  come  together  because  we  believe  that
nanotechnology  will  be  one  of  the  key  drivers  of  quality-of-life  improvements,  eco-
nomic growth and business success in the 21st century. The Alliance provides a col-
lective  voice  and  a  vehicle  for  efforts  to  advance  the  benefits  of  nanotechnology
across our economy and society.

The NanoBusiness Alliance strongly supports the National Nanotechnology Initia-

tive Amendments Act of 2008 as drafted.

The Need for This Legislation

This committee has long recognized that nanotechnology is one of the most impor-
tant  frontiers  of  science  and  technology,  and  that  nanotechnology  has  the  potential
to  dramatically  improve  our  quality  of  life,  our  health,  our  environment,  and  our
economy.  The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  which  this  committee  led  Con-
gress  in  authorizing  in  2003,  provided  the  framework  for  coordinated  federal  re-
search  and  development.  That  authorization  bill,  the  21st  Century  Nanotechnology
Research and Development Act, focused on fundamental nanotechnology research.

Now,  five  years  later,  it  is  time  to  reauthorize  and  update  this  legislation.  Much
has changed in the past half-decade; nanotechnology is beginning to move from the
laboratory  to  the  store  shelf.  American  nanotechnology  companies  are  beginning  to
shift  from  prototype  development  to  large-scale  manufacturing.  Employers  are  be-
ginning  to  look  for  a  nanotechnology-qualified  workforce.  And  the  public  is  begin-
ning  to  notice  nanotechnology,  with  its  many  benefits—and  some  potential  risks,
which need to be examined and managed.

That  the  nanotechnology  landscape  has  changed  so  much  in  five  years  is  in  no
small part due to the success of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. But its suc-
cess  at  jump-starting  the  Nation’s  nanotechnology  economy  means  that  the  Initia-
tive now needs to be updated to reflect five years of growth.

We are pleased that the Committee has thought carefully about how best to bring
the National Nanotechnology Initiative up to date. The draft legislation will improve
the  Initiative’s  capabilities  in  several  key  areas,  including  translational  research
and  commercialization;  nanotechnology  education;  and  environmental,  health,  and
safety research.

Translational Research and Commercialization

initiative 

As the Members of this committee know, America faces intense global competition
in  every  field.  But  nowhere  is  this  competition  more  intense  than  in  the  field  of
nanotechnology.  Nanotechnology’s  economic  potential  has  led  countries  across  Eu-
rope  and  Asia  to  make  large  strategic  investments  in  nanotechnology  research  and
development. The stated goal of many of these countries is to dominate one or more
sectors  of  the  nanotechnology  economy.  Russia  has  announced  a  $7  billion
nanotechnology 
that  will  spend  nearly  $750  million  more  on
nanotechnology research each year than the United States will. China already is on
par with the United States, when purchasing power is taken into account.

The United States continues to lead the world in fundamental nanotechnology re-
search,  but  over  the  last  five  years  we  have  seen  our  foreign  competitors  dem-
onstrate that they are becoming equally capable of commercializing nanotechnology.
By  leveraging  our  research,  these  foreign  governments  and  foreign  companies  are
skipping the hard work and reaping the economic benefits.

We  must  reverse  this  trend.  While  we  cannot  and  should  not  adopt  our  competi-
tors’ model of direct state investment in private companies, we can and should take
steps  to  ensure  that  innovative  American  companies  have  unfettered  access  to
American research, and that they are able to commercialize that research efficiently
and  effectively.  We  should  encourage  programs  such  as  Small  Business  Innovation
Research  (SBIR),  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  (STTR),  and  the  Technology
Innovation  Program  (TIP).  We  should  focus  our  efforts  on  goal-oriented  research  in
areas  of  national  importance.  And  we  should  do  everything  we  can  to  see  that  fed-
eral,  State,  and  private  resources  are  working  together  toward  the  goal  of  bringing
as much nanotechnology to market in the United States as possible.

The  draft  legislation  does  all  of  this.  It  retools  the  National  Nanotechnology  Ini-
tiative to focus more on goal oriented research, while maintaining a commitment to
fundamental  research.  It  gives  the  SBIR,  STTR,  and  TIP  programs  a  leading  role.
It  supports  large-scale  collaborative  efforts  to  develop  nanotechnology  solutions  to
key  public  policy  challenges  such  as  energy  efficiency,  environmental  cleanup,  and
health  care.  And  it  updates  the  Initiative  to  include  databases  and  other  informa-
tion-sharing  mechanisms  to  help  companies  and  researchers  understand  what  re-
sources are available.

Nanotechnology Education

The NanoBusiness Alliance is firmly committed to advancing nanotechnology edu-
cation. We cannot expect to compete in the global economy if we are not generating
nanotechnology-literate  students  who  will  go  on  to  become  leaders  and  workers  in
the  nanotechnology  economy.  We  need  to  inspire  American  students  to  choose
science tracks in high school, and then provide them with hands-on nanotechnology
opportunities in colleges and technical colleges.

As  it  stands,  we  are  educating  foreign  students,  and  then  sending  them  home  to
compete  against  us.  According  to  the  NSF,  foreign  students  on  temporary  visas
earned  32  percent  of  all  science  and  engineering  doctorates  awarded  in  the  United
States  in  2003,  the  last  year  for  which  data  is  available.  Foreign  students  earned
55  percent  of  engineering  doctorates.  Many  of  these  students  expressed  an  intent
to return to their country of origin after completing their studies.

The  Alliance  strongly  supported  the  Nanotechnology  in  the  Schools  Act,  and  we
are pleased to see that the current legislation reflects the goals of that bill. In par-
ticular, the Alliance supports putting nanotechnology tools in the hands of students,
so that they can see first-hand what nanotechnology is and why it is important (and
exciting).  The  Alliance  also  supports  integrating  local  nanotechnology  businesses
into the program; many of our members are already reaching out to schools in their
areas to help introduce students to nanotechnology.

Environmental, Health, and Safety Research

Nanotechnology  has  tremendous  potential  benefits  for  the  environment,  health,
and  safety  (EHS).  But  as  we  develop  nanotechnology  applications,  we  must  do  so
responsibly—identifying  and  addressing  any  risks  or  hazards  associated  with
nanotechnology before they cause environmental, health, or safety problems. The Al-
liance has called for the National Nanotechnology Initiative to include a comprehen-

29

sive, fully funded environmental, health, and safety research program, and this leg-
islation does just that. We strongly support this EHS research.

Americans need to know that the products they use are safe, or else they will not
purchase  or  use  them  and  the  market  for  those  products  will  collapse.  The  way  to
reassure consumers is not by ignoring any problems but by finding and dealing with
any  problems  that  may  exist.  A  clear  understanding  of  the  environmental,  health,
and  safety  impacts  of  various  kinds  of  nanoparticles  is  necessary,  and  that  under-
standing must expand as new nanoparticles are developed.

The  NanoBusiness  Alliance  believes  that  environmental,  health,  and  safety  re-
search  should  be  fully  funded  and  based  on  a  clear,  carefully-constructed  research
strategy.  While  we  believe  that  10  percent  of  the  total  funding  for  nanotechnology
research and development is a reasonable estimate of the resources that will be re-
quired  to  execute  the  strategic  plan,  we  also  believe  that  actual  resource  levels
should be driven by the strategic plan as they will vary significantly across agencies.
The  Alliance  appreciates  the  Committee’s  commitment  to  developing  a  broader
understanding of nanotechnology before erecting an extensive new regulatory struc-
ture. We hope that Congress will see the wisdom of the Committee’s approach, and
will  use  the  research  authorized  by  this  bill  as  a  basis  for  the  decision  of  what,  if
any, new regulation is needed.

Conclusion

leadership 

I would like to thank the Committee once again for the invitation to testify today,

NanoBusiness  Alliance  commends  this  committee  and  its  staff  for  the  careful  re-
search  and  extensive  collaboration  that  have  led  to  this  proposed  legislation.  We
strongly support the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008 as

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JOSEPH  S.  KRAJCIK,  PROFESSOR  OF
SCIENCE EDUCATION; ASSOCIATE DEAN OF RESEARCH, UNI-
VERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Dr. KRAJCIK. Chairman Gordon, Mr. Ehlers, and Members of the
Committee,  I  am  honored  to  present  testimony  on  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008. My name is Joe
Krajcik,  and  I  have  been  involved  in  science  education  for  the  last
34  years,  first  as  a  high  school  science  teacher  and  now  as  pro-
fessor of science education at the University of Michigan. I am cur-
rently  co-PI  in  a  National  Science  Foundation  Center  for  Teaching
and  Learning  in  Nanoscale  Science  and  Engineering;  and  because
of this, I will speak primarily about the educational components of
the Act.

Let me begin by stating that we live in a very exciting time with
respect  to  advances  in  science  and  technology.  We  also  live  in  a
very exciting time with respect to education because we now know
more  about  how  people  learn  than  ever  before.  The  advances  of
nanoscale  science  and  the  global  economy  in  which  we  live  chal-
lenge the educational community to help all children develop deep-
er and more useful understanding of core science ideas that under-
lie nanoscience. Unfortunately, despite what we know about learn-
ing,  the  current  education  system  is  failing  to  produce  a  populace
scientifically 
literate  enough  to  understand  the  advances  of
nanoscience  and  to  prepare  a  workforce  for  the  new  jobs  and  pro-
fessions  that  are  emerging  from  this  field.  Children  in  our  country
continue to lag behind in science and mathematics on international
assessments.  Perhaps  most  unfortunately,  the  most  under-served
children are in locations where typically children do not succeed in
science: our nation’s larger urban cities and rural areas.

As a nation, as we become more diverse, the challenge of how to
provide  quality  science  instruction  is  amplified.  Our  children  will
grow up in a world where they will need to apply and communicate
scientific  ideas,  make  sound  decisions  based  upon  this  under-
standing,  and  collaborate  with  other  people  to  solve  important
problems.

The  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  provides  im-
portant  support  to  improve  the  education  of  children  in  this  coun-
try.  Although  this  is  an  important  first  step,  I  question  whether
this  Act  will  provide  sufficient  resources  to  make  a  difference  for
all children. The advances in nanoscience requires a commensurate
response  from  the  educational  community.  As  such,  the  financial
resources  needed  to  make  this  response  possible  must  be  provided
by the national government with the private sector sharing in this
responsibility.

To  provide  world-class  science  education  so  that  all  children
learn  ideas  about  nanoscience,  our  country  needs  to  invest  in  sev-
eral important initiatives. First, we need to invest in sustained pro-
fessional development to support sixth through 12th grade teachers
in learning content in the interdisciplinary way of thinking that is
pervasive  in  nanoscience.  Many  teachers  studied  science  when
nanoscience  ideas  and  the  phenomena  they  explained  had  not
emerged.  Without  providing  teachers  the  opportunity  to  learn  new
content  in  this  interdisciplinary  way  of  thinking,  they  will  not  be
able to instruct our children in these emerging science areas.

31

Sustained professional development is also needed to help teach-
ers  learn  new  pedagogical  strategies  and  teaching  techniques.  We
have  learned  much  in  the  last  10  years  about  how  to  promote
science  learning.  But  unfortunately,  many  of  these  practices  are
not seen in science classrooms.

Second,  our  country  needs  to  develop  new  standards  and  assess-
ments  that  focus  on  the  core  ideas  of  science  including  those  cen-
tral  to  nanoscience.  Although  the  National  Science  Education
Standards  moved  this  country  forward  in  promoting  standard-
based  reform,  the  standards  are  now  at  a  stage  for  renovation,  as
they do not include ideas related to nanoscience and still cover too
many  ideas  that  prevent  learners  from  developing  useful  under-
standing.

We  also  need  to  provide  incentives  to  align  all  states  in  this
country  with  this  new  shared  vision  of  science  teaching  and  learn-
ing.

Third,  this  country  needs  to  develop  new  instructional  resources
including  new  learning  technologies.  Most  instruction  materials
used in classrooms today do not include emerging science ideas and
do not include the latest ideas about how children learn.

Fourth,  we  need  to  ensure  that  6th  through  12th  grade  science
classrooms  have  appropriate  equipment  and  facilities  to  allow  all
students  to  experience  and  explore  doing  science.  When  not  fea-
sible,  partnerships  with  private  sectors  and  universities  need  to
provide this equipment.

Fifth,  we  need  to  redesign  undergraduate  education,  including
science teacher preparation programs, so that new ideas in science
and  learning  and  the  interdisciplinary  manner  of  thinking  that
nanoscience  incorporates  are  included.  It  is  only  through  revamp-
ing  undergraduate  education,  including  teacher  preparation,  that
we will make lasting changes in science education. We need teach-
ers  who  understand  emerging  ideas  in  science  and  the  new  ideas
in  teaching  and  learning.  As  such,  we  need  to  provide  incentives
to attract the very best science majors to teaching careers.

Finally, we need to build partnerships with the private sector in

sharing in the cost of this effort.

In  summary,  to  ensure  all  children  in  this  country  have  access
to  world-class  science  education  that  will  help  them  understand
nanoscience  and  prepare  them  for  fruitful  lives  in  the  future  econ-
omy,  we  need  to  provide  sustained  professional  development,  ren-
ovate  science  education  standards,  develop  and  test  new  instruc-
tional  materials,  provide  for  appropriate  equipment  and  resources,
and redesign undergraduate education and build partnerships with
the private sector.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  express  my  professional  view.

and  high  school  levels.  I  am  co-PI  on  an  NSF-funded  center,  the  National  Center
for  Teaching  and  Learning  in  Nanoscale  Science  and  Engineering,  whose  primary
goal is to enhance the teaching and learning of nanoscience in grades 7–16 through
learning research.

Let  me  begin  by  stating  that  we  live  in  an  exciting  time  with  respect  to  the  ad-
vances  in  science  and  technology,  and  that  we  know  more  about  how  people  learn
than  ever  before.  Rapid  advances  in  nanoscience  have  provided  us  with  new  prod-
ucts  that  have  enhanced  the  quality  of  our  lives  ranging  from  diagnosing  disease
to improving the clothes we wear. At the same time, these new advances have also
raised potential new dangers, because we have now created products that can pene-
trate the protective layer of skin that covers our bodies.

Nanoscale science and engineering are at the core of these changes and advance-
ments.  These  new  advances  in  nanoscience  also  have  the  potential  to  make  the
teaching  of  science  more  exciting  and  to  build  student  engagement.  Unfortunately,
this  promise  has  not  been  realized  in  most  of  our  7–12th  grade  science  classrooms.
These  breakthroughs  in  science  have  brought  new  challenges  to  science  teaching
and  learning.  The  advances  of  nanoscale  science  and  the  global  economy  in  which
we  live  challenge  the  educational  community  to  help  students  develop  deeper  and
more useful understanding of core science ideas that underlie nanoscience. Unfortu-
nately,  the  current  education  system  is  failing  to  produce  a  populace  scientifically
literate  enough  to  understand  the  scientific  advances  of  nanoscience.  It  is  also  fail-
ing to prepare a workforce for the new jobs and professions that are emerging from
nanoscience.  Children  in  our  country  continue  to  lag  behind  in  science  and  mathe-
matics on international assessments; yet understanding science and mathematics is
critical  both  for  informed  citizenship  and  for  global  competitiveness.  To  remedy
these  problems  our  country  needs  to  invest  in  1)  professional  development  to  sup-
port 6–12 science teachers in learning content related to nanoscience and new peda-
gogical ideas that are supported by learning research; 2) develop new standards and
assessment  that  focus  on  the  core  ideas  in  science,  including  those  central  to
nanoscience;  3)  develop  new  instructional  resources,  including  new  learning  tech-
nologies,  that  focus  on  nanoscience;  4)  redesign  undergraduate  education,  including
science teacher preparation programs, so that new ideas in science and learning are
incorporated  into  them;  and  5)  incentives  to  attract  science  majors  and  people  who
currently hold science majors into teaching careers.

We  are  also  living  in  an  exciting  time  because  of  the  breakthroughs  in  under-
standing  how  to  promote  learning  in  science  in  general.  Learning  scientists  and
science  educators  are  making  important  discoveries  about  ways  to  support  learners
in  various  aspects  of  inquiry,  including  the  use  of  evidence  and  the  construction  of
scientific explanations (Bransford, J.D., Brown, A.L., & Cocking, R.R., 1999; Duschl,
Schweingruber,  Shouse,  2007).  The  science  standards  on  inquiry,  described  in  the
National Science Education Standards (1996) and the habits of mind articulated in
Benchmarks for Science Literacy (American Association for the Advancement of Soci-
ety,  1993),  provide  guidelines  for  how  teachers  should  teach  science.  The  science
standards  and  benchmarks  provide  direction  on  the  content  ideas  that  children
should  know  and  the  scientific  practices  they  should  be  able  to  apply  in  order  to
be  scientifically  literate.  New  breakthroughs  in  technologies  allow  scientists  and
learners  to  explore  the  nanoworld  and  visualize  data  in  new  ways.  Yet,  even  with
these fascinating breakthroughs, many science classrooms in the United States still
resemble  classrooms  of  the  early  1950s,  with  outdated  equipment  and  pedagogical
strategies  that  lack  support  for  most  learners.  Perhaps  most  unfortunate,  many  of
these  classrooms  are  in  locations  where,  typically,  children  do  not  succeed  in
science—our nation’s large urban cities and rural areas. As our nation becomes even
more  diverse,  with  growing  populations  of  Hispanics,  African-Americans  and  other
cultures,  the  challenge  of  how  to  provide  quality  science  instruction  is  amplified.
These children will grow up in a world where they will need to apply ideas, commu-
nicate  ideas,  make  sound  decisions  based  on  evidence,  and  collaborate  with  others
to  solve  important  problems.  Many  of  the  new  discoveries  are  in  the  area  of
nanoscience,  and  our  children  need  to  be  prepared  to  enter  this  world.  Yet  most  of
our  schools  are  not  providing  our  students  with  the  opportunities  to  develop  the
level  of  science  understanding  they  will  need  to  grasp  emerging  ideas  of  the
nanoscale.  Our  science  curriculum  still  concentrates  on  covering  too  much  content
without  focusing  enough  on  developing  deep,  meaningful  understanding  that  learn-
ers will need to grasp these new areas or that they will need to make personal and
professional  decisions.  Research  has  shown  that  students  lack  fundamental  under-
standing of science in general and in particular the ideas that will help them under-
stand  nanoscience.  What  content  should  be  taught?  How  should  new  ideas  about
nanoscience be introduced into 7–12 classrooms?

Through  the  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  (15  U.S.C.  7501(d) ),
the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008 provides for the es-
tablishment  of  Nanoscience  Education  Partnerships.  This  Act  will  help  provide  im-
portant support to improve the education of all children in this country with respect
to nanoscience education. The Act calls for 1) professional development activities to
support  secondary  school  teachers  to  use  curricular  materials  incorporating
nanotechnology and to inform teachers about career possibilities in nanotechnology;
2)  enrichment  activities  for  students,  and  3)  the  identification  of  appropriate
nanotechnology  educational  materials  and  incorporation  of  nanotechnology  into  the
curriculum of schools participating in a Partnership. Although important first steps,
I question whether this Act through the formation of Partnerships will provide suffi-
cient  resources  that  will  make  a  difference  for  all  children  throughout  the  country.
The advance in nanoscience requires a commensurate response from the educational
community  to  prepare  our  youth.  As  such,  the  financial  resources  needed  to  make
this response must be provided by the national government with help from the pri-
vate  sector.  In  particular,  we  need  to  ensure  that  all  children  in  our  country  have
access  to  first-rate  science  education  that  will  help  them  understand  the  ideas  of
nanoscience and other emerging ideas.

The Nanotechnology Research and Development Act calls for providing support for
professional development of teachers in nanotechnology. Yet, we need to make sure
that  this  professional  development  is  grounded  in  the  science  that  teachers  teach,
focuses  on  teachers’  practices  and  provides  long-term,  standards-based  support
(Garet,  Porter,  Desimone,  Birman,  &  Yoon,  2001).  The  short-term  professional  de-
velopment that most teacher experience will not provide enough or the type of sup-
port needed for most teachers to understand many of the new ideas and the chang-
ing ways of thinking about science at the nanoscale. The ideas of nanoscience were
not in textbooks when many of our current teaching force attended college. As such,
professional  development  will  be  needed  that  focuses  on  helping  teachers  under-
stand  the  new  ideas  of  nanoscience.  Moreover,  sustained  professional  development
must  provide  science  teachers  support  to  use  pedagogical  strategies  and  techniques
that will help students understand ideas behind nanoscience. One critical area that
professional development needs to focus on is how to help teachers support students
to  generate,  use,  and  evaluate  evidence  to  create  scientific  explanations  (Duschl,
Schweingruber,  Shouse,  2007).  Another  critical  area  includes  support  in  using  new
learning  technologies  to  engage  students  in  visualizing  the  nanoworld;  there  are
some  good  resources  (see  the  Concord  Consortium  Web  site,  Concord.org,  and  the
NCLT web site, NCLT.US) available to teachers already. Use of these new resources
and instructional strategies will require sustained professional development.

Nanoscience is also an interdisciplinary field. Advances in science and technology
are  blurring  the  lines  between  the  individual  scientific  disciplines.  As  science  be-
comes more interdisciplinary, we can no longer rely on the traditional ways of teach-
ing  science  as  a  set  of  well-understood,  clearly  depicted,  stand-alone  disciplines.
However, how to teach in this fashion is not easy, particularly when teachers them-
selves  did  not  experience  education  in  this  manner  and  pre-service  programs  pre-
paring  science  teachers  require  science  majors  in  specific  science  disciplines  rather
than providing interdisciplinary education. These present realities further the cycle
of  thinking  within  disciplines  rather  than  between  disciplines.  We  need  to  provide
professional  development  and  universities  need  to  prepare  teachers  to  teach  in  this
interdisciplinary  manner.  Moreover,  our  nation  needs  to  have  learning  research  to
support models of how to support teachers teaching in this manner.

Once  teachers  develop  the  content  knowledge  and  pedagogical  skills  to  teach
nanoscience, they still will still face challenges teaching these new ideas to children
unless they have appropriate classroom materials and resources. Some good instruc-
tional materials are beginning to appear, but more development and research is nec-
essary  to  understand  how  they  promote  student  learning.  Although  some  teachers
can  develop  curriculum  materials,  teachers  modify  curriculum  to  their  local  needs.
If  teachers  can  start  with  coherent  materials  that  are  known  to  promote  learning,
there  is  a  great  chance  that  students  will  learn  important  ideas  (Kesidou,  &  Rose-
man, 2002).

Although the national science education standards in this country helped to bring
about a focus on standards-based reform and coherent educational materials and as-
sessments,  the  standards  are  now  outdated  and  need  revamping.  New  standards
that  focus  on  the  big  ideas  of  nanoscience  (Stevens,  Sutherland,  Shank,  &  Krajcik,
2008)  and  other  knowledge  essential  for  the  21st  century  need  to  be  developed  and
adapted  by  schools.  Important  ideas  in  nanoscience  are  not  currently  incorporated
in  the  national  standards.  Nanoscience  education  introduces  students  to  emerging
ideas of science and supports understanding of the interconnections between the tra-
ditional  scientific  domains  by  providing  compelling,  real-world  interdisciplinary  ex-

amples  of  science  in  action.  However,  standards-based  teaching  with  an  inter-
disciplinary  focus  will  also  require  extensive  and  sustained  professional  develop-
ment.

The  national  science  education  standards  also  need  renovation  because  there  are
too  many  standards.  We  know  from  successes  in  other  countries  and  from  research
studies that attempting to cover too many ideas leads students to develop superficial
knowledge that they cannot use to solve problems, make decisions, and understand
phenomena.  Hence,  our  national  science  education  standards  need  reworking,  up-
dating and consolidating.

Renovating the standards is critical because assessments are driven by standards.
If we develop standards that include the content understandings and scientific prac-
tices that we cherish for our children to develop, then more appropriate assessments
will follow. Our current testing practices, however, put stress on classroom teachers,
particularly  when  the  testing  practices  do  not  align  with  important  learning  goals.
Assessment,  particularly  assessment  that  challenges  learners  to  use  ideas  and  in-
form  their  development,  is  a  good  thing.  We  know  that  learners  need  to  experience
science  in  engaging  contexts  and  apply  ideas  in  order  to  learn;  yet  with  so  many
standards,  teachers  feel  as  if  they  must  cover  topics  in  fear  that  students  will  not
succeed on high stakes examinations rather than focus on helping students develop
understanding.  The  national  standards  have  allowed  us  to  make  headway  in  im-
proving  science  instruction,  but  they  still  focus  on  too  many  content  ideas  and  do
not emphasis emerging ideas. Rather than focusing on covering too many ideas, our
nation  needs  a  long-term  developmental  approach  to  learning  science  that  focuses
on the ideas we most care about and takes into consideration learners’ prior knowl-
edge and how ideas build upon each other. The Act needs to include provisions that
take  into  account  this  development  and  research  work  to  develop  new  standards
that can drive development of appropriate assessments, and new instructional mate-
rials and resources.

As  our  country  now  exists,  each  state  has  different  standards,  in  addition  to  the
national  standards.  This  is  not  a  workable  system.  We  need  to  make  certain  that
states  buy  into  any  new  national  standards  and  assessments  by  providing  appro-
priate incentives. We need to find ways to ensure that states align themselves with
these renovated national standards.

Learning  nanoscience  will  not  occur  without  appropriate  resources  for  teaching
these  new  ideas.  The  resources  also  need  to  include  new  laboratory  equipment  and
technology  equipment  to  teach  nanoscience.  Although  the  Nanotechnology  Research
and Development Act provides funds for course, curriculum and laboratory improve-
ment  for  undergraduate  education,  the  Act  does  not  call  for  updating  secondary
science  laboratories.  The  Act  needs  to  provide  support  for  improving  secondary
school science laboratory equipment. In order to learn science, students need to have
essential firsthand experiences when possible and secondhand experiences to under-
stand the complex ideas underlying nanoscience. Nanoscience cannot be taught and
students  will  not  develop  understanding  of  the  ideas  underlying  nanoscience  with-
out  first-  and  secondhand  experiences.  Students  need  to  experience  and  do  science
if they are going to learn with understanding. However, most U.S. high schools and
middle  school  are  ill-equipped  for  students  to  have  these  experiences.  Budget  cuts
have caused schools to stop purchasing consumable science supplies and new mate-
rials, preventing students from experiencing phenomena. New laboratory equipment
needs  to  allow  learners  to  take  part  in  inquiry  experiences  that  will  allow  learners
to  put  ideas  together  so  that  they  can  solve  problems,  make  decisions,  use  and
evaluate evidence, and explain phenomena.

The Nanotechnology Research and Development Act includes funds to revamp un-
dergraduate  education.  Because  of  new  content  and  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of
nanoscience, a revamping of how science is taught at the undergraduate level needs
to  occur.  Lasting  change,  however,  will  only  occur  in  K–12  education  if  support  is
provided  to  revamp  how  we  prepare  new  teachers  to  teach  emerging  sciences  such
as  nanoscience.  We  need  to  provide  incentives  to  attract  college  students  who  have
a  deep  understanding  of  the  science  into  the  teaching  profession  by  providing  new
models of how they can enter certification programs. A major recommendation of the
Glenn  Report  is  that  we  need  to  find  ways  to  attract  science  and  mathematics  un-
dergraduates  into  the  field  of  teaching  and  provide  viable  ways  for  them  to  learn
how to teach and obtain certification. Preparing science teachers to teach in schools
so that they can help all learners develop the level of understanding of science they
need  requires  the  revamping  of  undergraduate  science  and  mathematics  courses  so
that they reflect more what it is like to do science and mathematics as well as new
models of how to prepare teachers. The Act needs to provide funds for both of these
critical  efforts.  We  will  not  change  K–12  schools  in  the  long  run  unless  we  change

undergraduate  teacher  education  programs  that  better  prepare  teachers  how  to
teach.

To  summarize,  schools  face  pressing  challenges  with  respect  to  resources,  assess-
ment  and  professional  development.  Many  teachers  did  not  experience  science  in
which ideas built upon each other in a developmental approach, where evidence was
used  to  support  claims  and  where  science  ideas  were  used  to  explain  important
problems and phenomena; as such, we need models of professional development and
the  resources  that  can  support  teachers  as  life  long  learners  to  learn  new  peda-
gogical strategies and new assessment practices. New ideas that emerge in science,
such as nanoscience, also present challenges for teachers with respect to integration
into curriculum.

For our children to live fruitful and fulfilled lives in an ever-globalizing world, our
nation needs a system of science education that can prepare a scientifically literate
population  and  a  competent  scientific  workforce  that  has  a  useful  understanding  of
the big ideas of science, including those of nanoscience. We are at a moment in his-
tory  in  which  we,  as  a  nation,  need  to  provide  learners  with  the  scientific  experi-
ences,  skills,  and  habits  of  mind  that  will  allow  them  to  make  important  decisions
regarding the environment, their health, and our social policies. We have a growing
body of knowledge that can help bring about this reform to science education.

We  are  at  a  crossroads  in  science  education.  We  can  continue  to  push  and  build
upon the knowledge, resources and models of exemplary teachers who know how to
engage  students  deeply  to  reform  science  education,  or  we  can  retreat  to  old  peda-
gogical strategies that don’t work. We need to build upon the strengths we have as
a  nation  and  resist  yielding  to  testing  pressures  that  focus  on  unimportant  ideas
and  pedagogical  strategies  that  we  know  do  not  work.  Yet,  we  will  only  do  so  with
leadership  and  support  from  our  national  government.  We  need  funding  to  provide
for  and  study  the  impacts  of  sustained  professional  development  and  the  develop-
ment  of  new  science  standards  that  take  into  consideration  what  we  know  about
how  children  learn.  We  also  need  support  to  design  curriculum  resources  and  as-
sessments that align with the new standards and to study the impact of these high
quality  resources  on  student  learning.  Finally  we  need  support  for  the  revamping
of  undergraduate  education  and  developing  new  models  of  preparing  teachers  to
teach.  The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act  of  2008  provides
some  support  for  these  important  initiatives,  but  to  provide  the  education  that  all
children,  regardless  of  their  backgrounds  and  culture,  need  to  live  in  a  technology-
driven world will require more support for improving teaching and learning.

I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  present  testimony  to  the  House
Committee  on  Science  and  Technology.  I  hope  that  you  have  found  some  of  my  re-
marks valuable.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOSEPH S. KRAJCIK

Joseph  S.  Krajcik,  a  Professor  of  Science  Education  and  Associate  Dean  for  Re-
search  in  the  School  of  Education  at  the  University  of  Michigan,  works  with  teach-
ers in science classrooms to bring about sustained change by creating classroom en-
vironments in which students find solutions to important intellectual questions that
subsume essential learning goals and use learning technologies as productivity tools.
He  seeks  to  discover  the  depth  of  student  learning  in  such  environments,  as  well
as  to  explore  and  find  solutions  to  challenges  that  teachers  face  in  enacting  such
complex instruction. In collaboration with colleagues from Northwestern University,
American Association of Science, and Michigan State, Joe, through funding from the
NSF, is a principle investigator in a materials development project that aims to de-
sign,  develop  and  test  the  next  generation  of  middle  school  curriculum  materials  to
engage  students  in  obtaining  deep  understandings  of  science  content  and  practices.
Professor  Krajcik  has  authored  and  co-authored  over  100  manuscripts  and  makes
frequent presentations at international, national and regional conferences that focus
on his research as well as presentations that translate research findings into class-
room  practice.  He  is  a  fellow  of  the  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of
Science and served as President of the National Association for Research in Science
Teaching in 1999. Joe co-directs the Center for Highly Interactive Classrooms, Cur-
riculum  and  Computing  in  Education  (hi-ce)  at  the  University  of  Michigan  and  is
a  co-principle  investigator  in  the  Center  for  Curriculum  Materials  in  Science  and
The National Center for Learning and Teaching Nanoscale Science and Engineering.
In  2002,  Professor  Krajcik  was  honored  to  receive  a  Guest  Professorship  from  Bei-
jing Normal University in Beijing, China. In Winter 2005, Joe was the Weston Vis-
iting  Professor  of  Science  Education  at  the  Weizmann  Institute  of  Science  in
Rehovot,  Israel.  Before  obtaining  his  Ph.D.  in  Science  Education,  Joe  taught  high
school  chemistry  for  seven  years  in  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.  He  received  a  Ph.D.  in
Science  Education  from  the  University  of  Iowa  in  1986.  His  home  page  is  located

Chairman GORDON. Dr. Krajcik, I have some good news and bad
news  for  you.  The  good  news  is  that  99  percent  of  your  rec-
ommendations were incorporated into a bill that we passed and the
President  signed  last  year  called  the  America  COMPETES  Act.
Amazingly, you recited the bill, basically. The bad news is that the
tree  doesn’t  fall  if  you  don’t  hear  it  in  that  we  have  not  been  able
to  get  the  proper  funding,  or  any  funding  really,  for  the  bill  yet.
However, working with Dr. Ehlers, we are working in a bipartisan
way  to  try  to  at  least  start  that  funding  process.  We  have  cir-
culated  a  letter.  Again,  we  have  several  Members  on  that.  I  see
representatives  from  Texas  Instruments  here.  They  have  been  a
part  of  bringing  together  I  think  175  to  200  major  industries  and
associations  also  recommending  that  the  America  COMPETES  Act

gets  funded.  So  hopefully  at  least  the  good  news  there  is  we  have
the  authorization,  and  we  are  working  very  hard  to  try  to  get  the
funding for your almost exact recommendation.

Now,  Dr.  David,  you  and  Dr.  Ehlers,  would  you  like  to  just  say

amen?

Dr. Maynard, you are recognized.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ANDREW  D.  MAYNARD,  CHIEF  SCIENCE
ADVISOR,  PROJECT  ON  EMERGING  NANOTECHNOLOGIES,
WOODROW  WILSON  INTERNATIONAL  CENTER  FOR  SCHOL-
ARS
Dr.  MAYNARD.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  would  like  to  thank  you,
Chairman Gordon, Mr. Ehlers, and the Members of this committee
for holding today’s hearing. My name is Dr. Andrew Maynard. I am
the  Chief  Science  Advisor 
the  Project  on  Emerging
Nanotechnologies  which  is  a  partnership  between  the  Woodrow
Wilson  International  Center  for  Scholars  and  the  Pew  Charitable
Trusts. But of course, the views I express here are my own.

Nanotechnology  is  counter-intuitive.  It  involves  a  world  where
materials  just  don’t  play  by  the  rules  as  we  know  them  but  dem-
onstrate  many  strange  and  wonderful  behaviors.  Metals  change
color,  inert  materials  become  highly  reactive,  what  was  once  weak
becomes  strong.  For  instance,  if  you  take  a  material  like  this,  this
is  nanoscale  titanium  dioxide,  it  looks  like  a  mundane,  white  pow-
der. But this material’s superfine structure which is invisible to the
naked  eye  allows  this  particular  material  to  be  used  to  kill  mi-
crobes, make self-cleaning windows, and ensure that mineral-based
sunscreens go onto the skin transparently.

Because  nanotechnology  is  counter-intuitive,  safe  nanotechnolo-
gies will not just happen. We will need leadership and guidance to
help  overcome  our  human  scale  perspective  and  ensure  the  rule
book for safe nanotechnology is built on sound science.

In this context, I want to highlight five areas I believe are essen-
tial to underpinning the development of safe and therefore success-
ful nanotechnologies.

First  and  foremost,  I  believe  we  need  a  top-level  research  strat-
egy  that  identifies  the  goals  of  nanotechnology  research  across  the
Federal  Government  and  provides  a  roadmap  for  achieving  these
goals.

Secondly, I strongly believe a minimum of 10 percent of the Fed-
eral  Government’s  nanotechnology  R&D  budget  should  be  dedi-
cated  to  goal-oriented  environmental,  health,  and  safety  research.
Any  less  than  this  will  risk  compromising  the  success  of  emerging
nanotechnologies.

Thirdly, a coordinator should be appointed with responsibility for
overseeing  and  implementing  a  nanotechnology  environmental,
health, and safety research strategy across the government.

Fourthly,  public-private  partnerships  are  needed  that  leverage
government  and  industry  funds  to  address  critical  nanotechnology
oversight  issues  in  an  independent,  transparent,  and  timely  man-
ner.

And  finally,  government  actions  to  support  the  development  of
safe  nanotechnologies  must  be  transparent.  Without  transparency,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:09 Sep 22, 2008 Jkt 041672 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\041608\41672 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

there  is  no  clear  foundation  for  enabling  strategic  planning  or  en-
gendering trust within industry or the public.

I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  transparency  has  been  an  issue  for
safety  research  so  far  within  the  NNI.  Recently  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative announced that $68 million was spent on
nanotech risk-related research in Fiscal Year 2006. But as has hap-
pened  many  times  now,  no  clear  supporting  data  were  given  for
this figure.

Sifting  through  the  research  claiming  to  be  relevant  to
nanotechnology  safety,  I  could  only  find  $13  million  that  was  in-
vested  in  research  that  is  highly  relevant  to  addressing  the  health
and  environmental  impacts  of  nanotechnology  for  2006.  The  same
analysis,  and  this  is  somewhat  interesting,  for  research  in  Europe
over  the  same  period  reveals  an  investment  of  $24  million  in
nanotech safety research over the same period.

Unlike  the  NNI,  the  information  that  this  analysis  is  based  on
is  freely  available  on  the  web  for  anyone  to  see  and  anyone  to
verify.  The  bottom  line  here  is  that  without  supporting  evidence,
any  assessment  of  what  the  government  is  doing  to  address
nanotechnology  impacts  is  quite  simply  not  worth  the  paper  it  is
written on.

Nanotechnology  will  not  succeed  through  wishful  thinking.  In-
stead, it will depend on clear and authoritative leadership from the
top.  The  proposed  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments
Act of 2008 addresses each of the areas I have just highlighted and
in  my  personal  opinion  supports  the  leadership  necessary  for  the
successful development of safe nanotechnologies.

I personally commend the Committee for promoting transparency
through  a  public  database  of  research.  This  will  complement  the
International Public Database on Environmental, Health and Safe-
ty  Research  to  be  launched  by  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-
operation and Development in June of this year.

I also believe the proposed Act takes an important step in assign-
ing  to  a  single  coordinator  the  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  an
adequately  funded  and  leveraged  top-down  strategic  plan  for
nanotechnology EHS research is developed and implemented.

When  I  look  back  on  the  origins  of  the  NNI,  I  am  impressed  by
the  foresight  and  quality  of  leadership  exerted  by  the  Congres-
sional  visionaries  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  together  with  the
President and the Executive Branch, scientists and engineers, busi-
ness  people,  and  educators.  But  perhaps  because  the  tremendous
success achieved in the laboratory since its creation, we do risk los-
ing  sight  of  the  challenges  involved  in  taking  the  NNI  to  the  next
level  of  research,  education,  governance,  and  commercialization.  It
is  my  belief  that  with  the  proposed  Act  and  with  a  continued  vigi-
lance of this committee, this will not happen. Thank you.

Executive Summary

Nanotechnology has vast potential to address some of the greatest challenges fac-
ing society, including global climate change, poverty and disease. And with this po-

ation. The success of nanotechnology however is not a foregone conclusion. Alongside

the  challenges  of  developing  the  underlying  science  are  broader  issues  that  will  in-
fluence its success or failure:

– How can we learn to use such a powerful technology wisely?
– Who will decide how it is used, and who will pay the cost?
• How can innovative science be translated into successful products?
– And in an increasingly crowded and connected world, how will the supposed–

beneficiaries of nanotechnology be engaged in its development and use?

These questions will not be answered without a clear strategy. And without vision
and strong leadership, the future of safe and successful nanotechnologies will be put
in jeopardy.

This  committee  should  be  applauded  for  having  the  foresight  to  author  the  21st
Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act—an  Act  that  has  enabled
the  United  States  to  lead  the  world  in  developing  research  programs  to  unlock  the
potential  of  the  nanoscale.  Yet  as  nanotechnology  has  increasingly  moved  from  the
laboratory to the marketplace, the challenges have shifted from stimulating innova-
tive  research  to  using  this  research  in  the  service  of  society.  This  is  why  it  is  so
important  that  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendment  Act  of  2008
builds on the strengths of the 2003 Act, and establishes a framework that will sup-
port nanotechnologies that can deliver on their promise. In particular, it is vital that
the  reauthorization  addresses  the  potential  for  nanotechnologies  to  cause  harm—
and how this might be avoided.

Real and perceived risks that are poorly identified, assessed and managed will un-
dermine even the most promising new technologies, and nanotechnology is no excep-
tion.  In  this  context,  the  2008  Act  needs  to  explicitly  address  five  areas  if  it  is  to
establish  a  sound  framework  for  enabling  safe,  sustainable  and  successful
nanotechnologies:

1. Risk  Research  Strategy.  A  top-level  strategic  framework  should  be  devel-
oped that identifies the goals of nanotechnology risk research across the Fed-
eral  Government,  and  provides  a  roadmap  for  achieving  these  goals.  The
strategy  should  identify  information  needed  to  regulate  and  otherwise  over-
see  the  safe  development  and  use  of  nanotechnologies;  which  agencies  will
take a lead in addressing specific research challenges; when critical informa-
tion is needed; and how the research will be funded. This top-level, top-down
strategy  should  reflect  evolving  oversight  challenges.  It  should  be  informed
by  stakeholders  from  industry,  academia  and  citizen  communities.  It  should
include measurable goals, and be reviewed every two years.

2. Funding for environmental safety and health research. A minimum of
10  percent  of  the  Federal  Government’s  nanotechnology  research  and  devel-
opment budget should be dedicated to goal-oriented environment, health and
safety  (EHS)  research.  At  least  $50  million  per  year  should  be  directed  to-
wards  targeted  research  directly  addressing  clearly-defined  strategic  chal-
lenges.  The  balance  of  funding  should  support  exploratory  research  that  is
conducted  within  the  scope  of  a  strategic  research  program.  Funding  should
be assessed according to a top-level, top-down risk research strategy, and be
overseen by cross-agency leadership.

3. Leadership for risk research. A cross-agency group should be established
that  is  responsible  for  implementing  a  nanotechnology  EHS  research  strat-
egy,  and  is  accountable  for  actions  taken  and  progress  made.  A  coordinator
should be appointed to oversee this group, as well as given resources and au-
thority  to  enable  funding  allocations  and  interagency  partnerships  that  will
support the implementation of a strategic research plan.

4. Transparency. Government-funded nanotechnology environment safety and
health  research  investment  should  be  fully  transparent,  providing  stake-
holders  with  information  on  project  activities,  relevance,  funding  and  out-
comes.

5. Public-Private  Partnerships.  Partnerships  that  leverage  public  and  pri-
vate  funds  to  address  critical  nanotechnology  oversight  issues  in  an  inde-
pendent,  transparent  and  timely  manner  should  be  established,  where  such
partnerships  have  the  capacity  to  overcome  the  limitations  of  separate  gov-
ernment and industry initiatives.

Nanotechnology  is  a  truly  revolutionary  and  transformative  technology,  and  we
cannot  rely  on  past  ways  of  doing  things  to  succeed  in  the  future.  Without  strong
leadership from the top, we run the risk of compromising the whole enterprise—not

only  losing  America’s  technological  lead,  but  also  jeopardizing  the  good  that  could
come out of nanotechnology for other countries and the world.

Already, the hubris surrounding nanotechnology research and development (R&D)
funding  is  giving  way  to  a  sobering  reality:  Based  on  the  federal  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)-identified  risk-relevant  projects,  in  2006,  the  Fed-
eral  Government  spent  an  estimated  $13  million  on  highly  relevant  nanotechnology
risk research (approximately one percent of the nano R&D budget), compared to $24
million  in  Europe,1 despite  assurances  from  the  NNI  that  five  times  this  amount
was spent on risk related research in Fiscal Year 2006.2

Nanotechnology  will  not  succeed  through  wishful  thinking  alone.  Instead,  it  will
depend on clear and authoritative leadership from the top. If we are to fully realize
the benefits of this innovative new technology, we must bridge the gap between our
dreams and reality.

When I look back on the origins of the NNI, I am impressed by the foresight and
quality  of  leadership  exerted  by  Congressional  visionaries  from  both  sides  of  the
aisle, the President and Executive Branch, scientists and engineers, business people,
and  educators.3 Perhaps  because  of  the  tremendous  successes  achieved  in  the  lab-
oratory since its creation, we risk losing sight of the importance of meeting the chal-
lenges  involved  in  taking  the  NNI  to  the  next  level  of  research,  education,  govern-
ance  and  commercialization.  It  is  my  belief  that  with  the  proposed  Act—and  with
the continued vigilance of this committee—this will not happen.

Introduction

I  would  like  to  thank  Chairman  Bart  Gordon,  Ranking  Republican  Ralph  Hall,
and  the  Members  of  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  for  holding
this hearing on the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008.

My  name  is  Dr.  Andrew  Maynard.  I  am  Chief  Science  Advisor  to  the  Project  on
Emerging  Nanotechnologies  (PEN)  at  the  Woodrow  Wilson  International  Center  for
Scholars.  Through  my  research  and  other  activities  over  the  past  15  years,  I  have
taken  a  lead  in  addressing  how  nanotechnologies  might  impact  human  health  and
the environment, and how we might realize the benefits of these exciting new tech-
nologies without leaving a legacy of harm. I was responsible for stimulating govern-
ment  research  programs  into  the  occupational  health  impact  of  nanomaterials  in
Britain towards the end of the 1990’s. I spent five years developing and coordinating
research  programs  at  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention’s  (CDC)  Na-
tional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that address the safety
of nanotechnologies in the workplace. While at NIOSH, I represented the agency on
the  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering  and  Technology  (NSET)  Subcommittee  of  the
National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC),  and  was  Co-Chair  of  the
Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implications  (NEHI)  Working  Group
from its inception.

In  my  current  role  as  Chief  Science  Advisor  to  PEN,  I  work  closely  with  govern-
ment, industry and other groups to find science-based solutions to the challenges of
developing nanotechnologies safely and effectively. PEN is an initiative launched by
the  Woodrow  Wilson  International  Center  for  Scholars  and  The  Pew  Charitable
Trusts in 2005.4 It is dedicated to helping business, government and the public an-
ticipate  and  manage  the  possible  health  and  environmental  implications  of
nanotechnology. As part of the Wilson Center, PEN is a non-partisan, non-advocacy
policy  organization  that  works  with  researchers,  government,  industry,  non-govern-
mental organizations (NGOs), and others to find the best possible solutions to devel-
oping responsible, beneficial and acceptable nanotechnologies.

In  this  testimony,  I  will  lay  out  essential  components  of  an  overarching  frame-
work to cultivate the growth and innovation of the emerging field of nanotechnology
while  providing  safeguards  for  environmental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  and  com-
ment  on  the  extent  to  which  the  current  draft  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Ini-
tiative Amendments Act of 2008 addresses these components.

The  two  aims  of  stimulating  innovation  and  avoiding  harm  need  not  be,  nor
should  be,  mutually  exclusive.  A  successful  strategy  of  scientific  and  technological

innovation, integrated with EHS research, will ensure that the promised benefits of
such  a 
thwarted  by  potential  EHS  disasters.  With
nanotechnology, we have the opportunity to do things differently. It is my belief that
the  proposed  reauthorization  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  will
redefine how emerging technologies are developed successfully and safely.

Underpinning Sustainable Nanotechnologies

The promise of nanotechnology

Nanotechnology  has  the  potential  to  revolutionize  the  world  as  we  know  it.  The
increasing  dexterity  at  the  nanoscale  provides  opportunities  to  greatly  enhance  ex-
isting  technologies  and  to  develop  innovative  new  technologies.  When  you  couple
this  capability  with  the  unusual  and  sometimes  unique  behavior  of  materials  that
are  engineered  at  near-atomic  scales,  you  have  the  basis  for  a  transformative  tech-
nology  that  has  the  potential  to  impact  virtually  every  aspect  of  daily  life.  Some  of
these  emerging  technologies  will  benefit  individuals,  while  others  will  help  solve
pressing  societal  challenges  like  climate  change,  access  to  clean  water  and  cancer
treatment.  And  many  will  provide  companies  with  the  competitive  edge  they  need
to succeed. In all cases, nanotechnology holds within it the potential to improve the
quality of life and economic success of America and the world beyond.

Unconventional behavior

The  benefits  of  nanotechnology,  however,  will  not  be  realized  by  default.
Nanotechnology is taking our understanding of what makes something harmful and
how we deal with that, and turning it upside down. New engineered nanomaterials
are  prized  for  their  unconventional  properties.  But  these  same  properties  may  also
lead  to  new  ways  of  causing  harm  to  people  and  the  environment.5 Research  has
already  demonstrated  that  some  engineered  nanomaterials  can  reach  places  in  the
body  and  the  environment  that  are  usually  inaccessible  to  conventional  materials,
raising  the  possibility  of  unanticipated  harm  arising  from  unexpected  exposures.
And studies have shown that the toxicity of engineered nanomaterials is not always
predictable  from  conventional  knowledge.6 For  instance,  we  now  know  that
nanometer  sized  particles  can  move  along  nerve  cells;  that  the  high  fraction  of
atoms  on  the  surface  of  nanomaterials  can  influence  their  toxicity;  and  that
nanometer-diameter  particles  can  initiate  protein  mis-folding,  possibly  leading  to
diseases.

The need for foresight

Moving  towards  the  nanotechnology  future  without  a  clear  understanding  of  the
possible  risks,  and  how  to  manage  them,  is  like  driving  blindfolded.  The  more  we
are able to see where the bends in the road occur, the better we will be able to navi-
gate around them to realize safe, sustainable and successful nanotechnology applica-
tions. But to see and navigate the bends requires the foresight provided by strategic
science.

With  over  600  products  currently  listed  on  the  PEN’s  Consumer  Products  Inven-
tory7 and with hundreds more commercial nanotechnology applications on the mar-
ket  or  under  development,  the  question  is  no  longer  whether  nanotechnologies  will
impact  society  but  how  significant  the  impact  will  be.  The  question  for  policy-mak-
ers  is  how  these  impacts  will  be  manifest,  and  how  we  will  manage  the  con-
sequences.

Avoiding harm

Central  to  developing  sustainable  nanotechnologies  is  an  understanding  of  how
new  materials  and  products  may  harm  people  and  the  environment,  and  how  pos-
sible risks may be avoided or otherwise managed.

Everything  has  the  potential  to  cause  harm.  If  we  are  smart,  we  learn  how  to
avoid  harm.  And  if  we  are  very  smart,  we  work  out  the  rules  of  safe  use  ahead  of
the game. In a world of more than six billion people, everything that occurs has an

impact  on  some  place  and  someone.  And  as  a  result,  each  emerging  technology
forces  us  to  think  harder  about  what  the  consequences  might  be,  and  how  to  avoid
them.

Ignoring  the  signs  of  adverse  consequences  will  only  result  in  poor  decision-mak-
ing  by  governments,  business  and  individuals.  While  nanotechnology  undoubtedly
has  the  potential  to  do  great  good,  the  consequences  of  getting  it  wrong  could  be
devastating. Already, research is indicating that many nanomaterials behave in un-
usual  and  unconventional  ways  that  may  lead  to  human  and  environmental  harm
if not addressed early on.

A new mindset for a new technology

Twenty-first  century  technologies  like  nanotechnology  present  new  challenges  to
identifying and managing risks, and it would be naive to assume that twentieth cen-
tury  assumptions  and  approaches  are  up  to  the  task  of  protecting  health  and  the
environment  in  all  cases.  In  the  case  of  engineered  nanomaterials,  the  importance
of physical structure in addition to chemical composition in determining behavior is
making a mockery of our chemicals-based view of risks and regulation.

As  a  simple  example,  imagine  picking  up  two  common  kitchen  implements—a
skillet  and  a  knife.  Each  can  be  used  for  very  different  purposes—for  instance,  the
knife for slicing an onion and the skillet for frying it. Likewise, each implement can
cause  harm  in  different  ways.  Yet  the  chemical  makeup  of  each  implement  is  very
similar—it is predominantly iron. The very different rules for safe use are intuitive,
because one can see how the different shapes of the implements influence behavior.
Nanomaterials are the same, in that how they behave—for good or bad—depends
on their shape as well as their chemistry. But this is where nanotechnology becomes
counter-intuitive.  Because  we  cannot  see  these  intricate  nano-shapes  unaided,  we
forget  that  they  are  important.  If  one  were  to  hold  up  ajar  of  nanometer-sized  tita-
nium  dioxide  particles  all  that  would  be  seen  is  a  white  powder,  indistinguishable
from many other powdered materials. Yet the potential for this material to be used
in  new  applications,  and  possibly  to  cause  harm  in  new  ways,  lies  within  the
nanoscale structure of the material that can only be seen using advanced microscopy
techniques.

Leadership

In thinking through how the potential risks of nanotechnologies can be proactively
addressed and the technologies can be developed safely, some things are clear. Safe
nanotechnologies will not happen without help—nanotechnologies are simply too un-
conventional and counter-intuitive. Neither will safe nanotechnologies emerge if the
promoters  of  the  technology  are  calling  all  the  shots.  And  in  a  similar  vein,  safe
nanotechnologies will not come about through wishful thinking and ‘‘spin.’’

Instead, there needs to be strong independent leadership, and a framework within
which  safe  and  sustainable  nanotechnology  can  be  developed.  These  must  ensure
adequately  funded  research  is  targeted  towards  understanding  and  addressing
counter-intuitive  behavior,  that  the  process  of  developing  safe  and  sustainable
nanotechnologies  is  transparent  and  inclusive,  and  that  activities  are  coordinated
and directed towards developing solutions to developing and using nanotechnologies
as safely as possible.

Only then will it be possible to develop the foresight necessary to ensure emerging
nanotechnologies  are  as  safe  and  as  useful  as  possible.  Having  set  the  pace  of
nanotechnology  development  in  the  U.S.  through  the  21st  Century  Nanotechnology
Research  and  Development  Act,  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
now  has  the  task  of  ensuring  these  emerging  nanotechnologies  deliver  on  their
promise; benefiting society without causing harm.

Taking Action

Risk Research Strategy

We  are  unlikely  to  arrive  at  a  future  where  nanotechnology  has  been  developed
responsibly  without  a  strategic  plan  for  how  to  get  there.  Like  all  good  strategies,
this should include a clear idea of where we want to be, and what needs to be done
to  get  there.  A  top-level,  top-down  strategic  framework  should  be  developed  that
identifies the goals of nanotechnology risk research across the Federal Government,
and that provides a roadmap for achieving these goals. The strategy should identify
information needed to regulate and otherwise oversee the safe development and use
of  nanotechnologies;  which  agencies  will  take  a  lead  in  addressing  specific  research
challenges; when critical information is needed; and how the research will be fund-

ed. It should reflect evolving oversight challenges; be informed by stakeholders from
industry;  academia  and  citizen  communities;  include  measurable  goals;  and  be  re-
viewed every two years.

Developing  an  effective  roadmap  to  addressing  these  challenges  is  not  as  simple
as prioritizing research needs. As I discovered while developing recommendations on
research  strategies  in  2006,8 it  is  necessary  to  work  back  from  what  you  want  to
achieve,  and  map  out  the  research  steps  needed  to  get  there.  This  inevitably  leads
to complex and intertwined research threads. Yet if this complexity is not acknowl-
edged,  the  result  is  simplistic  research  priorities  that  look  good  on  paper,  but  are
ineffective  at  addressing  specific  aims.  And  without  a  clear  sense  of  context,  it  is
all  too  easy  to  highlight  research  efforts  that  appear  to  be  strategically  important,
but are in reality only marginal to achieving the desired goals.

The bottom line is that for such a strategy to be effective, it will require top-down
leadership.  Establishing  provisions  for  an  effective  nanotechnology  risk  research
strategy  to  be  developed,  funded  and  implemented  in  the  National  Nanotechnology
Initiative Amendment Act of 2008 will be essential to underpinning the success and
safety of current and future nanotechnologies, as well as ensuring America’s contin-
ued leadership in this area.

Funding for Environment, Safety and Health Research

To  be  effective,  a  nanotechnology  risk-research  strategic  framework  needs  ade-
quate  funding  to  support  proposed  research,  as  well  as  sufficient  expert  personnel
to  oversee  its  development  and  implementation.  In  2006,  the  U.S.  spent  an  esti-
mated  $13  million  on  highly  relevant  research  addressing  the  impacts  of
nanotechnology  on  human  health  and  the  environment.9 By  comparison,  European
countries  invested  approximately  $24  million,  including  $13  million  from  the  Euro-
pean  Union  as  a  central  funding  organization.  But  these  figures  fall  far  short  of
what is needed to address even the most urgent nanotechnology EHS questions.

In  my  testimony  to  this  committee  on  September  21,  2006,10 and  more  recently
on  October  31,  2007,11 I  made  the  case  for  a  minimum  of  $50  million  annually  to
be  spent  on  targeted  nanotechnology  risk  research  within  the  U.S.  This  was  based
on  an  assessment  of  critical  short-term  research  needs,  and  only  covered  highly-fo-
cused research to address these needs.12 This estimate still stands. However, I must
be  clear  that  such  an  investment  would  need  to  be  directed  towards  addressing  a
very specific suite of problems that regulators and industry need answers to as soon
as  possible.  This  is  not  envisaged  as  a  general  pot  of  money  to  be  assigned  to  re-
search that does not address specific and urgent nanotechnology risk goals. In other
words,  this  is  an  investment  that  needs  to  be  directed  towards  the  right  research.
What  is  more,  such  an  investment  would  not  necessarily  generate  more  general
knowledge  to  effectively  address  emerging  nanotechnology  EHS  issues.  For  this,  an
additional  investment  is  needed  in  goal-oriented  exploratory  research—both  specifi-
cally  focusing  on  aspects  of  nanotechnology  that  might  lead  to  harm,  and  bridging
the worlds of applications and implications research.

To  address  both  targeted  and  exploratory  research  needs,  a  minimum  10  percent
of  the  Federal  Government’s  nanotechnology  research  and  development  budget
should  be  dedicated  to  goal-oriented  EHS  research.  A  minimum  of  $50  annually
should  go  to  targeted  research  directly  addressing  clearly-defined  strategic  chal-
lenges.  The  balance  of  funding  should  support  exploratory  research  that  is  con-
ducted within the scope of a strategic research program. Funding should be assessed
according to an interagency risk research strategy, be overseen by cross-agency lead-
ership and tied into the strategic research plan.

Targeted  research  primarily  should  address  specific  questions  where  answers  are
urgently  needed  to  make,  use  and  dispose  of  nanotechnology  products  as  safely  as
possible. I would envisage that much of the necessary research would be funded by
or  conducted  within  mission-driven  agencies,  such  as  the  National  Institute  for  Oc-

cupational  Safety  and  Health  (NIOSH)  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency
(EPA). In addition, we must ensure that regulatory agencies, including the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC),
either  have  access  to  resources  to  fund  regulation-relevant  research,  or  input  to  re-
search that will inform their decision-making.

There  will  also  be  a  role  for  science-oriented  agencies  such  as  the  National  Insti-
tutes  for  Health  (NIH)  and  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  in  funding  tar-
geted research, where the missions of these agencies coincide with research that in-
forms specific oversight questions. For example, these two agencies are ideally posi-
tioned  to  investigate  the  science  behind  nanomaterial  properties,  behavior  and  bio-
logical  interactions  in  a  targeted  way,  with  the  aim  of  predicting  health  and  envi-
ronmental  impact.  But  ensuring  that  targeted  research  conducted  within  these
agencies  is  relevant  to  addressing  risk  identification,  assessment  and  reduction
goals  will  be  critical,  and  underscores  the  need  for  a  robust  cross-agency,  risk-re-
search strategy and pool of designated funds.

Exploratory  research,  on  the  other  hand,  primarily  would  be  investigator-driven
(within determined bounds), and so would preferentially lie within the remit of NSF
and NIH. However, in ensuring effective use of funds, it will be necessary to develop
ways  of  supporting  interdisciplinary  research  that  crosses  the  boundary  separating
these  agencies,  and  combines  investigations  of  basic  science  with  research  into  dis-
ease  and  environmental  endpoints,  with  the  goal  of  informing  oversight  decisions.
Exploratory research should not be confined to these two agencies alone, as there
will  be  instances  where  goal-oriented  but  exploratory  research  will  fit  best  within
the scope of mission-driven agencies, and will benefit from research expertise within
these agencies. For example, researchers at NIOSH are currently engaged in explor-
atory  research  that  is  directly  relevant  to  identifying  and  reducing  potential
nanotechnology risks in the workplace.13

At present, there is no pot of ‘‘nanotechnology’’ money within the Federal Govern-
ment  that  can  be  directed  to  areas  of  need.  Rather,  the  NNI  simply  reports  what
individual agencies are spending. Yet if strategic nanotechnology risk research is to
be  funded  appropriately,  mechanisms  are  required  that  enable  dollars  to  flow  from
where  they  are  plentiful  to  where  they  are  needed.  Extremely  overstretched  agen-
cies  like  NIOSH  and  EPA  cannot  be  expected  to  shoulder  their  burden  of
nanotechnology  risk-research  unaided,  and  agencies  such  as  FDA  and  CPSC  cur-
rently  have  no  listed  budget  whatsoever  for  nanotechnology  EHS  research.  If  the
Federal Government is to fully utilize expertise across agencies and enable effective
nanotechnology oversight, resource-sharing across the NNI will be necessary.

Leadership for Risk Research

Without clear leadership, the emergence of safe nanotechnologies will be a happy

accident rather than a foregone conclusion.

This  is  a  collection  of  technologies  that  is  counter-intuitive  and  as  a  result,  safe
and  sustainable  nanotechnologies  will  not  emerge  without  help.  Accepted  mecha-
nisms  of  technology  development  and  transfer—including  investigator-driven  re-
search,  generation  of  intellectual  property,  knowledge  diffusion  and  market-driven
commercialization—will  not  ensure  the  information  and  approaches  needed  to
proactively  ensure  the  safety  of  emerging  nanotechnologies  on  their  own.  Instead,
clear and authoritative top-down leadership is needed to enable the generation and
application of information that will support safe nanotechnology development.

As  a  result,  it  is  recommended  that  a  cross-agency  group  be  established  that  is
responsible  for  implementing  a  nanotechnology  EHS  research  strategy,  and  is  ac-
countable  for  actions  taken  and  progress  made.  A  coordinator  should  be  appointed
to  oversee  this  group,  and  given  resources  and  authority  to  enable  funding  alloca-
tions  and  interagency  partnerships  that  will  support  the  implementation  of  a  stra-
tegic research plan. A key role for this coordinator would be to ensure agencies are
motivated  and  able  to  work  within  their  missions  and  competencies  toward  a  com-
mon  set  of  established  goals.  They  would  also  provide  leadership  to  the  broader
stakeholder  community  involved—both  nationally  and  internationally—in  devel-
oping safe nanotechnologies.

Transparency

Without  transparency,  effective  development,  implementation  and  review  of  a
strategic research framework will be hampered, stakeholder engagement will be im-

possible, and trust in the government to underpin safe nanotechnologies will be se-
verely  compromised.  As  a  result,  it  is  recommended  that  government-funded
nanotechnology  EHS  research  should  be  fully  transparent,  providing  stakeholders
with information on project activities, relevance, funding and outcomes.

Activities to date within the federal nanotechnology initiative have been less than
transparent,  to  the  detriment  of  an  effective  strategy  for  nanotechnology  develop-
ment  and  use.  For  example,  a  PEN  analysis  of  current  research  projects  listed  in
the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative’s  ‘‘Strategy  for  Nanotechnology-Related  En-
vironmental,  Health,  and  Safety  Research’’  found  that  only  62  of  the  246  projects
listed  were  highly  relevant  to  addressing  EHS  issues  (the  remaining  projects  had
some  relevance,  but  in  general  were  focused  on  exploiting  nanotechnology  applica-
tions).14 These  62  projects  accounted  for  an  estimated  $13  million  in  research  and
development funding for 2006—a far cry from the $68 million cited by the NNI doc-
ument as being focused on EHS research.15 Each of these 246 projects has some rel-
evance  to  addressing  nanotechnology  safety,  and  the  NNI  was  right  to  list  them.
But  by  not  categorizing  the  relevance  of  the  research  or  including  funding  figures
for  each  project,  the  stated  $68  million  being  invested  has  little  credibility—and  as
has just been shown, is indeed highly misleading.

to  underpinning  progress 

Lack of transparency such as this can only hinder the development of new knowl-
edge that is essential to ensuring safe and successful nanotechnologies. This is such
a 
towards  safe  and  successful
nanotechnologies  that  I  would  suggest  any  assessment  of  research  investment,  rel-
evance  or  direction  that  is  not  backed  up  by  publicly  accessible  project-specific  data
is worthless. It is for this very reason that the Organization for Economic Coopera-
tion  and  Development  (OECD)  Working  Party  on  Manufactured  Nanomaterials  is
developing  a  soon-to-be-launched  comprehensive  database  on  risk-relevant
nanotechnology research around the world.16

critical 

issue 

Public-Private Partnerships

Often,  partnerships  between  public  and  private  organizations  have  the  capacity
to address critical challenges in a manner that is beyond the scope of either partner
in  isolation.  To  expedite  progress  towards  ensuring  the  safety  of  emerging
nanotechnologies, it is recommended that partnerships are established that leverage
public  and  private  funds  to  address  critical  nanotechnology  oversight  issues  in  an
independent, transparent and timely manner and to overcome the limitations of sep-
arate government and industry research.

Where  research  needs  fall  between  the  gap  of  government  and  industry  (because
of  their  different  goals),  public-private  research  partnerships  provide  an  important
mechanism  for  bridging  the  gaps.  Industries  investing  in  nanotechnology  have  a  fi-
nancial  stake  in  preventing  harm,  manufacturing  safe  products  and  avoiding  long-
term  liabilities.  Yet  many  of  the  questions  that  need  answering  are  too  general  to
be  dealt  with  easily  by  industry  alone.  Perhaps  more  significantly,  the  credibility
of  industry-driven  risk  research  is  often  brought  into  question  by  the  public  and
NGOs  as  not  being  sufficiently 
independent  and  transparent.  For  many
nanomaterials  and  nanotechnologies,  the  current  state  of  knowledge  is  sufficient  to
cast doubt on their safety but lacks the certainty and credibility for industry to plan
a clear course of action on how to mitigate potential risks. Getting out of this ‘‘infor-
mation  trap’’  is  a  dilemma  facing  large  and  small  nanotechnology  industries  alike.
Cooperative  science  organizations  like  public-private  partnerships  provide  one
way  out  of  the  ‘‘trap’’  where  they  are  established  to  generate  independent,  credible
data  that  will  support  nanotechnology  oversight  and  product  stewardship.  Such  or-
ganizations  would  leverage  federal  and  industry  funding  to  support  targeted  re-

08). This inventory is in the process of being adopted and updated by the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development, Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials.

15 Further  independent  assessment  of  research  funded  in  2006  reveals  funding  for  highly  rel-
evant  risk  research  was  closer  to  $20  million  (http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/ehs,
accessed  4/8/08).  The  discrepancy  appears  to  be  due  to  relevant  research  that  the  NNI  missed
in their analysis—another indicator that the government is not on top of what research is being
funded, and lacks sufficient transparency for effective accountability.

Nanotechnologies inventory of nanotechnology Environment, Health and Safety Research (http:/

it will include information on project relevance to addressing nanotechnology risks, and funding

search  into  assessing  and  managing  potential  nanotechnology  risks.  Their  success
would depend on five key attributes:

Independence.  The  selection,  direction  and  evaluation  of  funded  research
would have to be science-based and fully independent of the business and views
of partners in the organization.
Transparency.  The  research,  reviews  and  the  operations  of  the  organization
should be fully open to public scrutiny.
Review.  Research  supported  by  the  organization  should  be  independently  and
transparently reviewed.
Communication. Research results should be made publicly accessible and fully
and effectively communicated to all relevant parties.
Relevance. Funded research should have broad relevance to managing the po-
tential  risks  of  nanotechnologies  through  regulation,  product  stewardship  and
other mechanisms.

As  I  discussed  in  my  comments  to  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Subcommittee  on  Research  and  Science  Education  last  October,17 a  number
of  research  organizations  have  been  established  over  the  years  that  comply  with
many  of  these  criteria.  One  of  these  is  the  Health  Effects  Institute  (HEI),18 which
has been highly successful in providing high-quality, impartial, and relevant science
around the issue of air pollution and its health impacts. The Foundation for the Na-
tional Institutes for Health19 also has been successful in developing effective public-
private  partnerships,  and  the  International  Council  on  Nanotechnology  (ICON)20 is
a third model for bringing government, industry and other stakeholders to the table
to  address  common  goals.  The  PEN  is  currently  exploring  these  and  other  models
as  possible  templates  for  public-private  partnerships  addressing  nanotechnology
risks.

Irrespective  of  which  model  is  the  best  suited  for  nanotechnology,  the  need  is  ur-
gent  to  develop  such  partnerships  as  part  of  the  government’s  strategy  to  address
nanotechnology  risks.  Nanotechnologies  are  being  commercialized  rapidly—going
from  $60  billion  in  manufactured  goods  in  2007  to  a  projected  $2.6  trillion  in
nanotechnology-enabled  manufactured  goods  by  2014—or  15  percent  of  total  manu-
factured goods globally.21 And knowledge about possible risks is simply not keeping
pace with consumer and industrial applications.

Conclusions

The  nanotechnology  future  is  calling  us  forward,  and  the  U.S.  is  at  the  forefront
of  the  race  to  get  there  as  fast  as  possible.  But  we  are  skating  on  thin  ice,  and  are
in danger of missing the warning signs. Nanotechnology is counter-intuitive, and we
cannot  rely  on  past  ways  of  doing  things  to  succeed  in  the  future.  Without  strong
leadership from the top, we run the risk of compromising the whole enterprise—not
only  loosing  America’s  lead,  but  also  jeopardizing  the  good  that  could  come  out  of
nanotechnology for other countries.

Already,  the  hubris  surrounding  nanotechnology  R&D  funding  is  giving  way  to  a
sobering reality: Based on NNI-identified risk-relevant projects, in 2006, the Federal
Government  spent  an  estimated  $13  million  on  highly  relevant  nanotechnology  risk
research (approximately one percent of the nano R&D budget), compared to $24 mil-
lion  in  Europe,  despite  assurances  from  the  NNI  that  five  times  this  amount  was
spent on risk related research in Fiscal Year 2006.

But  nanotechnology  will  not  succeed  through  wishful  thinking  alone.  Instead,  it
will  depend  on  clear  and  authoritative  leadership  from  the  top.  If  we  are  to  fully
realize  the  benefits  of  this  innovative  new  technology,  we  must  bridge  the  gap  be-
tween our dreams and reality.

In my personal view, the proposed National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendment
Act  of  2008  goes  a  long  way  to  bridging  this  gap.  I  particularly  commend  the  Com-
mittee  for  promoting  transparency  through  a  public  database  for  projects  funding
under  EHS;  education  and  societal  dimensions;  and  nanomanufacturing  program
component areas, with sub-breakouts for education and ethical, legal and social im-
plications  (ELSI)  projects.  This  database  will  complement  the  public  international
EHS  database  expected  to  be  launched  by  the  Organization  for  Economic  Coopera-
tion and Development (OECD) in June 2008, and will provide an essential resource
for  evaluating  the  Federal  Government’s  progress  towards  addressing  critical  re-
search questions, as well as developing future research strategies.

In  addition,  I  believe  the  proposed  act  takes  an  important  step  in  assigning  to  a
single  coordinator  the  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  a  top-down  strategic  plan  for
nanotechnology  environmental,  safety  and  health  research  is  developed  and  imple-
mented;  that  EHS  research  is  appropriately  funded  with  at  least  10  percent  of  the
total NNI budget; and that public-private partnerships are established that leverage
government and industry research initiatives.

in  nanotechnology. 

Finally,  as  the  Committee  knows,  my  in-depth  experience  lies  in  the  area  of  the
EHS  implications  of  nanotechnology.  But  as  one  of  the  many  scientists  and  engi-
neers deeply involved in nanotechnology development for over 20 years, I am genu-
inely  concerned  about  the  education  and  ‘‘nano-readiness’’  of  America’s  students,
teachers,  and  workforce.  For  this  reason,  I  personally  endorse  the  establishment  of
partnerships  to  help  recruit  and  prepare  secondary  school  students  to  pursue  post-
secondary  education 
to
nanotechnology  undergraduate  education,  faculty  development,  and  acquisition  of
equipment and instrumentation at the undergraduate level. When today China has
as  many  scientists  and  engineers  working  on  nanotechnology  as  the  U.S.,  it  is  crit-
ical  to  support  initiatives  in  nanotechnology  education  aimed  at  our  young  people.
Similarly,  the  U.S.  public  and  consumers  are  woefully  unprepared  for  the  nano-
age.  Polling,  focus  groups  and  social  science  research  commissioned  by  PEN  since
its inception show that Americans’ awareness of nanotechnology remains abysmally
low,  with  seven  in  10  adults  having  heard  just  a  little  of  nothing  at  all  about  it.22
This,  in  my  opinion,  is  a  significant  failing  of  the  NNI.  Too  few  resources  and  too
little expertise has been devoted to educating and engaging the public about the im-
plications  of  what  I  believe  is  one  of  this  century’s  most  exciting  areas  of  science
and  engineering.  I  particularly  urge  the  Committee  to  address  this  problem  as  it
works on the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendment Act of 2008.

I  also  support  enhancements 

When  I  look  back  on  the  origins  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  I  am
impressed  by  the  foresight  and  quality  of  leadership  exerted  by  Congressional  vi-
sionaries from both sides of the aisle, the President and Executive Branch, scientists
and engineers, business people, and educators.23 Perhaps because of the tremendous
successes  achieved  in  the  laboratory  since  its  creation,  we  risk  losing  sight  of  the
importance  of  meeting  the  challenges  involved  in  taking  the  NNI  to  the  next  level
of  research,  education,  governance  and  commercialization.  It  is  my  belief  that  with
the proposed Act—and with the continued vigilance of this committee—this will not
happen.

Assessment of U.S. Government Nanotechnology

Environmental Safety and Health Research for 2006

1. Assessment  of  research  listed  in  the  2008  NNI  nanotechnology  risk  re-

search strategy.24
a. Research  projects  highly  relevant  to  nanotechnology  environment  health
and  safety  accounted  for  an  estimated  $12.8  million  in  federal  research
funding in 2006.

b. Research 

that  was  either  highly  or  substantially

relevant 

to

c. The  majority  of  the  research  projects  listed  by  the  NNI  as  being  relevant  to

nanotechnology EHS have only limited relevance.

Listed research was categorized according to its relevance to addressing potential
nanotechnology  risks  (highly  relevant,  substantially  relevant,  having  some  rel-
evance,  or  having  marginal  relevance—as  defined  below).  Projects  specifically  ad-
dressing  engineered  nanomaterials,  as  well  as  projects  generally  applicable  to  any
source of nanoparticles, were included in the analysis.

The  methodology  for  categorizing  research  relevance  was  the  same  as  that  used
in  the  Project  on  Emerging  Nanotechnologies  on-line  inventory  of  nanotechnology
EHS research,25 and in the forthcoming OECD database of nanotechnology EHS re-
search.26 This  approach  allows  a  sophisticated  and  transparent  assessment  of  re-
search  investment.  The  categorization  is  based  on  published  project  abstracts,  and
how these relate to addressing risk-specific issues.
2. A broader assessment of U.S. federally-funded risk-relevant research for

2006
The  previously-released  PEN  inventory  of  EHS  research  contains  substantially
more  projects  than  are  listed  in  the  2008  NNI  risk  research  strategy.  Assessment
of  the  full  inventory  of  projects  reveals  that  more  risk-relevant  research  was  being
funded  in  2006  than  is  identified  by  the  NNI,  but  that  funding  levels  are  still  low:
a. Research  projects  highly  relevant  to  nanotechnology  environment  health
and  safety  accounted  for  an  estimated  $20.4  million  in  federal  research
funding in 2006.

b. Research 

that  was  either  highly  or  substantially 
nanotechnology EHS accounted for an estimated $37.8 million.

to

The  disparity  between  the  figures  above  and  NNI  figures  on  research  spending
underline  an  urgent  need  for  transparency  in  what  is  being  funded,  and  it’s  rel-
evance to addressing nanotechnology risk.
3. Comparison with European Risk Research Investments

a. In 2006, European countries invested an estimated U.S. $23.6 million in re-
search  that  was  highly  relevant  to  understanding  and  addressing  the  im-
pacts  of  nanotechnology  on  human  health  and  the  environment.  The  EU  as
a  central  funding  organization  invested  an  estimated  U.S.  $12.6  million  in
highly relevant research in 2006.

These  estimates  are  based  on 

‘‘EU
nanotechnology  R&D 
impact  of
nanoparticles,’’ published in 2008.27 Research funding within European countries for
calendar  year  2006  has  been  estimated.  The  analysis  includes  research  funded  by
the  European  Union,  Belgium,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Finland,  Germany,
Greece, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

4. Definitions of research relevance:

49

a. High: Research that is specifically and explicitly focused on the health, envi-
ronmental and/or safety implications of nanotechnology. Also included in this
category  are  projects  and  programs  where  the  majority  of  the  research  un-
dertaken  is  specifically  and  explicitly  focused  on  the  health,  environmental
and/or  safety  implications  of  nanotechnology.  Examples  of  research  in  this
category  would  include  research  to  understand  the  toxicity  of  specific
nanomaterials,  research  into  exposure  monitoring  and  characterization  to
further understand potential impact, research into biological interactions and
mechanisms  that  is  focused  on  answering  specific  questions  associated  with
potential  risk.  Examples  of  research  that  would  not  be  included  in  this  cat-
egory would include exploratory research into biological mechanisms outside
the  context  of  understanding  impact,  general  instrument  development,  and
research  into  therapeutics  applications  which  also  incorporate  an  element  of
evaluating impact.

b. Substantial:  Research  that  is  focused  towards  nanotechnology-based  appli-
cations  or  developing  fundamental  new  knowledge  on  nanoscienee,  but  that
has  substantial  and  explicit  relevance  to  EHS  implications.  Examples  of  re-
search  in  this  category  would  include  non-targeted  research  into  biological
mechanisms which is informative to understanding risk, instrument develop-
ment  for  assessing  nanomaterials  for  applications  and  characterizing
nanomaterials in hazard evaluations, and major programs with a significant
component focused on risk research.

c. Some: Research that is focused on the application of nanotechnology and de-
veloping  fundamental  new  knowledge  on  nanoscience  but  that  has  some  rel-
evance  to  EHS  implications.  Examples  might  include  research  into  thera-
peutics  applications  which  also  lead  to  the  generation  of  useful  data  on  haz-
ard.

d. Marginal:  Fundamental  nanoscience  and/or  nanotechnology  applications-
based  research,  which  informs  understanding  on  potential  EHS  implications
in  a  marginal  way.  Examples  might  include  the  development  of  new  analyt-
ical  techniques  such  as  analytical  electron  microscopy,  where  some  attempt
is  made  to  apply  the  techniques  to  understanding  potential  risks  unique  to
nanomaterials.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ANDREW D. MAYNARD

Dr.  Andrew  Maynard  is  the  Chief  Science  Advisor  to  the  Project  on  Emerging
Nanotechnologies-an  initiative  dedicated  to  helping  business,  government  and  the
public  anticipate  and  manage  possible  health  and  environmental  implications  of
nanotechnology. Dr. Maynard is considered one of the foremost international experts
on  addressing  possible  nanotechnology  risks  and  developing  safe  nanotechnologies.
As well as publishing extensively in the scientific literature, Dr. Maynard is a well-
known  international  speaker  on  nanotechnology,  and  frequently  appears  in  print
and on radio and television.

Dr.  Maynard  trained  as  a  physicist  at  Birmingham  University  in  the  UK.  After
completing a Ph.D. in ultrafine aerosol analysis at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cam-
bridge University (UK), he joined the aerosols research group of the UK Health and
Safety  Executive,  where  he  led  research  into  aerosol  behavior  and  characterization.
In  2000,  Dr.  Maynard  joined  the  National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and
Health  (NIOSH),  part  of  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention
(CDC).  Dr.  Maynard  was  instrumental  in  establishing  the  NIOSH  nanotechnology
research  initiative,  which  continues  to  lead  efforts  to  identify,  assess  and  address
the  potential  impacts  of  nanotechnology  in  the  workplace.  Dr.  Maynard  also  rep-
resented  NIOSH  on  the  Nanomaterial  Science,  Engineering  and  Technology  sub-
committee  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSET),  and  he  co-
chaired  the  Nanotechnology  Health  and  Environment  Implications  (NEHI)  working
group  of  NSET.  Both  are  a  part  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI),
the  federal  research  and  development  program  established  to  coordinate  the  U.S.
Government’s  annual  $1  billion  investment  in  nanoscale  science,  engineering,  and
technology.

Dr.  Maynard  continues  to  work  closely  with  many  organizations  and  initiatives
on the responsible and sustainable development of nanotechnology. He is a member
of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  International  Council  On  Nanotechnology
(ICON),  he  has  chaired  the  International  Standards  Organization  Working  Group
on size selective sampling in the workplace, and he has been involved in the organi-
zation of many international meetings on nanotechnology. Dr. Maynard has testified
before  the  U.S.  House  Committee  on  Science  &  Technology  on  nanotechnology  pol-
icy,  and  is  a  member  of  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology,  Nanotechnology  Technical  Advisory  Group.  Dr.  Maynard  is  an  Honorary
Senior  Lecturer  at  the  University  of  Aberdeen,  U.K.,  and  has  authored  or  co-au-
thored over 100 scholarly publications.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Maynard. Dr. David is recog-

nized.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  RAYMOND  DAVID,  MANAGER  OF  TOXI-
COLOGY FOR INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS, BASF CORPORATION
Dr.  DAVID.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the
Committee.  I  am  Dr.  Raymond  David.  I  am  a  toxicologist  with
BASF Corporation, but I am here on behalf of the American Chem-
istry  Council  and  Nanotechnology  Panel  to  speak  in  favor  of  the
National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008.

The infrastructure that the amendment would provide will great-
ly improve the ability of the United States to plan, coordinate, and
implement  research  programs,  especially  ones  focused  on  the  safe
use  of  nanotechnology.  The  infrastructure  and  focus  will  be  wel-
come in an area that has seen an explosion of research and experi-
mental  data  in  the  scientific  literature  but  not  necessarily  always
focused  on  addressing  any  one  particular  issue.  Under  the  NNI
amendment,  a  central,  federal  research  oversight  function  will  be
created to address specific research questions and provide the capa-
bility  to  utilize  all  the  federal  research  resources  available  to  an-
swer  any  one  particular  question,  much  like  other  governments
around the globe.

This  central  oversight  will  bring  the  strengths  of  organizations
such  as  the  EPA,  NIH,  NCTR,  and  the  National  Characterization

Laboratory  together  to  resolve  a  particular  question,  and  they  can
do that in a fashion that will be much faster than academia or in-
dustry alone could resolve.

The  amendments  mandate  that  NNI  provide  information  to  the
academic and industrial research communities on current research
programs, so that we can reduce the redundancy on some of the ex-
periments  we  see,  available  techniques  and  methodologies,  and  fa-
cilities that can support robust scientific research. This information
will  be  welcome  in  an  area  that  we  have  seen  a  lot  of  redundancy
in  terms  of  the  scientific  literature  and  hopefully  gain  acceptance
of  minimal  characterization  evaluation  parameters  so  that  people
will know exactly what the characteristics of the nanomaterials are
that  they  are  testing.  This  is  something  that  is  presently  lacking
and would otherwise make their research uninterpretable.

The  ACC  strongly  supports  the  intention  to  educate  all  stake-
holders, especially the public, on nanotechnology. I think we are at
a  crossroads  in  terms  of  the  public  perception  with  respect  to  the
uses  of  nanomaterials.  Some  of  the  information  that  the  public  re-
ceives  from  the  media  tends  to  overemphasize  the  uncertainties  of
nanotechnology. We believe that it is important that the public un-
derstand  the  true  risks  and  benefits  of  this  technology  and  the
nanomaterials  that  are  being  used,  and  they  need  to  receive  that
in a very clear, straightforward manner.

Of  course,  these  amendments  and  the  infrastructure  that  they
creates  does  not  guarantee  success.  The  proof  is  really  in  the  pud-
ding.  The  implementation  is  what  is  important.  The  ACC  would
also like to re-emphasize that a comprehensive and prioritized fed-
eral  research  strategy  focusing  on  EHS  concerns  is  still  missing.
What  we  need  to  do  is  we  need  to  focus  on  assessments  of  risks
to  health  and  the  environment.  We  need  to  promote  new  inter-
disciplinary relationships. We need to support better understanding
of  the  fundamental  properties  of  nanomaterials  and  how  that  im-
pacts  the  risk  assessment.  We  need  to  develop  processes  for  estab-
lishing  standard  protocols  so  that  individual  and  maybe  categories
of nanomaterials can be evaluated. We need to clearly delineate the
responsibilities,  programs,  timelines,  and  anticipated  results  of
funded projects. And I think we need to leverage planned research
that  is  ongoing  throughout  the  world,  particularly  in  the  OECD.
We  have  previously  urged  an  independent  review  by  the  National
Research Council’s Board of Environmental Studies and Toxicology
to  establish  research  priorities  for  manufactured  nanomaterials.
We continue to believe that that is an important effort that should
be  pursued  so  that  we  can  develop  a  comprehensive  roadmap  with
appropriate projects and priorities and evaluation metrics.

The nanotechnologies panel member companies want to foster re-
sponsible  application  of  nanotechnology.  We  want  to  share  and  co-
ordinate EHS initiatives, and we want to facilitate the exchange of
information.

We look forward to working with the Congress and NNI to make
the  implementation  of  these  amendments  a  success.  We  hope  the
bill  will  be  passed,  and  we  look  forward  to  that  happening.  Thank
you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RAYMOND DAVID

Good  Morning  Chairman  Gordon  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  Dr.  Ray-
mond David, a toxicologist with BASF Corporation, and appearing before you today
on  behalf  of  the  American  Chemistry  Council  and  ACC’s  Nanotechnology  Panel  to
speak  in  favor  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act  of  2008.
I  appreciate  Chairman  Gordon’s  invitation  to  address  the  House  Committee  on
Science and Technology on the role of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI)
in  planning  and  implementing  the  environmental,  safety,  and  health  research  nec-
essary for the responsible development of nanotechnology.

ACC represents the leading companies engaged in the business of chemistry. ACC
members  apply  the  science  of  chemistry  to  make  innovative  products  and  services
that  make  people’s  lives  better,  healthier  and  safer.  In  2005,  ACC  formed  its
Nanotechnology  Panel  consisting  of  domestic  producers  that  are  engaged  in  the
manufacture,  distribution,  and/or  use  of  chemicals  that  have  a  business  interest  in
the products of nanotechnology. Panel member companies wish to foster the respon-
sible  application  of  nanotechnology;  to  coordinate  nanotechnology  environmental,
health,  and  safety  research  initiatives  undertaken  by  member  companies  and  other
organizations;  and  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of  information  among  member  compa-
nies and other domestic and international organizations on issues related to applica-
tions and products of nanotechnology.

The  infrastructure  that  the  NNI  amendments  would  create  will  greatly  improve
the ability of the U.S. to plan, coordinate, and implement research programs—espe-
cially  ones  focused  on  the  safe  use  of  nanomaterials,  an  issue  that  has  been  raised
many  times  in  the  past  few  years.  This  infrastructure  and  focus  will  be  welcome
in  an  area  that  has  seen  an  explosion  of  research  and  generation  of  experimental
data—not  always  focused.  The  U.S.  has  had  many  intellectual  and  financial  re-
sources  applied  to  studying  nanomaterials,  but  not  necessarily  directed  at  solving
any  one  issue.  Under  the  NNI  amendment,  a  central,  federal,  research  oversight
function would be created to address specific research questions and provide the ca-
pability  to  utilize  all  federal  resources  to  answer  those  questions—much  like  other
governments throughout the globe.

This centralized oversight will bring the strengths of each federal research organi-
zation  together  to  address  a  single  issue.  For  example,  scientists  in  the  National
Characterization  Laboratory  in  Frederick,  MD,  have  extensive  experience  detecting
a variety of nanomaterials in biological fluids; scientists in NIOSH have verified the
protective effect of personal protective equipment and have investigated the cellular
effects of dermal exposure; and scientists in NIEHS and NCTR have developed tech-
niques  and  conducted  experiments  to  better  understand  the  potential  for  dermal
penetration of nanomaterials. Being able to bring all these entities and expertise to-
gether  to  answer  specific  questions  on  the  applied  nanomaterials  could  bring  swift
answers  to  questions  that  would  take  industry  or  academia  alone  much  longer  to
evaluate.

The  amendments  would  also  mandate  that  NNI  provide  information  to  the  aca-
demic  and  industrial  research  community  on  current  research  programs,  available
techniques  and  methodologies,  and  facilities  to  support  robust  scientific  research.
This information should reduce the redundancy that we currently find in the explo-
sion  of  scientific  literature,  and  help  gain  acceptance  of  minimal  characterization
criteria  needed  for  understanding  the  nature  of  what  particle  was  tested—nano
sized  or  otherwise.  Too  often  we  find  published  studies  that  refer  only  to  obtaining
a nanomaterial from a vendor and adding that to a biological test system. Investiga-
tors  need  to  know  how  and  where  they  get  characterized  nanomaterials  for  study.
Otherwise,  their  research  may  be  difficult  to  interpret  in  the  context  of  human  or
environmental safety assessment.

ACC  strongly  supports  the  amendment’s  purposes  to  have  NNI  provide  support
for  programs  designed  to  educate  all  stakeholders,  including  the  public,  on
nanotechnology.  The  public  may  very  well  have  a  skewed  perception  of
nanotechnology  and  specifically  the  use  of  nanomaterials.  Sensational  articles  on
nanotechnology  in  the  mainstream  media  can  distort  information,  and  we  all  must
be mindful of the urgent need to present information on nanotechnology in a factu-
ally accurate, balanced way. The public will be far less likely to be receptive to this
emerging  technology  if  information  about  its  potential  risks  and  benefits  is  not
faithfully reported in clear, straightforward terms.

Of course, the infrastructure that these amendments would provide does not guar-
antee  success.  Implementation  is  what  is  important.  ACC  would  also  like  to  re-em-
phasize that a high quality, comprehensive and prioritized federal research strategy
focusing  on  nanotechnology  environment,  health,  and  safety  is  still  missing  and
should:

operation  and  Development’s  (OECD)  Working  Party  on  Manufactured
Nanomaterials,  particularly  in  identifying  on-going  or  planned  research
projects  by  other  countries  and  interpreting  the  results  of  this  research,  and
the  testing  of  representative  nanomaterials  using  standard  test  methods  to
assess potential health or environmental hazards.

so that individual or categories of materials can be studied;

sults of funded projects for each federal agency; and

When  ACC  testified  before  you  last  October,  we  urged  as  an  appropriate  next
step, the funding of an independent review by the National Research Council Board
of  Environmental  Studies  and  Toxicology  (BEST)  to  establish  EHS  research  prior-
ities  for  manufactured  nanomaterials  and  a  substantial  increase  in  federal  funding
of  EHS  programs  for  manufactured  nanomaterials.  ACC  continues  to  believe  that
BEST  should  develop  and  monitor  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  roadmap  for
federal EHS research projects and set priorities with evaluation metrics suitable for
federal  funding.  This  funding  would  enable  BEST  to  develop  a  roadmap  and  strat-
egy for the Federal Government for environmental, health, and safety research.

We look forward to working with the Congress and NNI to make the implementa-
tion of the NNI amendments a success. We are hopeful that this bill will be passed
to allow that to happen.

you are recognized.

STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT R. DOERING, SENIOR FELLOW
AND RESEARCH STRATEGY MANAGER, TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
Dr.  DOERING.  Chairman  Gordon,  Members  of  the  Committee,
thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  the  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act  of  2008.  Texas  Instru-
ments and the Semiconductor Industry Association view two topics
as key to the legislation, first, identification of areas of national im-
portance  and  second,  translation  of  basic  research  into  commer-
cialization.  These  are  essential  to  ensuring  that  the  NNI  program
maintains  U.S.  leadership  in  nanotechnology  and  contributes  to
economic competitiveness.

Appropriately,  the  bill  identifies  four  areas  of  national  impor-
tance: electronics, health care, energy, and water purification. This
will  prioritize 
interagency  activities  and  resources  around
nanotechnology  research  to  address  critical  challenges  facing  our
country.  The  INSI  are  encouraged  that  electronics  is  the  first  area

that 

it  be 

strongly  advocates 

listed  and 
renamed  as
nanoelectronics. Nanoelectronics will actually play a key role in es-
sentially every area of national importance. It will enable improved
information  processing,  communications,  imaging  and  sensor  tech-
nologies that will assist in addressing energy challenges, improving
health  care,  and  detecting  national  security  threats.  Advanced
nanoelectronics  research  is  needed  because  the  CMOS  technology
that  the  semiconductor  industry  has  used  for  over  30  years  is  pro-
jected to reach its performance, energy efficiency, and cost limits by
the  year  2020.  In  2005,  six  U.S.  semiconductor  companies  formed
a  consortium,  the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative,  to  provide
industry  funds  to  universities  to  accelerate  this  research.  Today,
the  NRI  leverages  funding  and  expertise  from  industry,  NSF,  and
NIST,  as  well  as  contributions  from  state  and  local  governments
and supports research at 35 universities and four regional centers.
This  collaboration  model  can  be  replicated  to  address  other  na-
tional  challenges  with  nanotechnology  research.  The  draft  legisla-
tion  recognizes  and  encourages  such  models.  To  effectively  pursue
research  in  the  areas  of  national  importance,  universities  and  fed-
eral labs will need adequate resources for research funding and es-
sential equipment. NNI investments in the areas of national impor-
tance  should  be  reported  in  the  same  manner  that  they  currently
are for the program component areas.

The bill recognizes the basic nanotechnology research should lead
to commercial applications. Industry can play an important role in
establishing  a  balance  between  directed  basic  research  and  its  po-
tential  commercialization  by  providing  insights  on  an  appropriate
goals and needs for both. For example, there are a number of can-
didates for new nanoelectronics devices, but to be viable these must
be  capable  of  being  manufactured  in  commercial  volumes  at  low
cost.  This  may  require  an  entirely  new  nanomanufacturing  para-
digm.

Also, as we move nanoelectronics to even smaller dimensions, the
metrology  challenges  will  only  increase,  an  important  role  for
NIST.  Thus,  the  bill’s  call  for  instrumentation  and  tools  for
nanoscale  manufacturing  is  a  significant  element  for  the  semicon-
ductor  industry.  In  addition,  the  draft  legislation  rightly  identifies
the important role of state leverage through research, development,
and technology transfer initiatives. The State of Texas, the Univer-
sity  of  Texas  System,  and  Texas  Industry  collaborated  to  establish
a  $30  million  complimentary  package  of  leveraged  funding  to  at-
tract and support top academic researchers at the Southwest Acad-
emy of Nanoelectronics which is one of the regional centers in NRI.
Currently, the NRI state and local leverage for all regional centers
totals about $15 million annually.

In  conclusion,  while  the  legislation  establishes  an  important
framework,  corresponding  appropriations  will  need  to  follow.  We
look  forward  to  continuing  our  work  with  this  committee  to  suc-
cessfully achieve the funding goals of America COMPETES and the
President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  as  the  National
Nanotechnology  Amendments  Act  of  2008  moves  towards  final  pas-
sage. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT R. DOERING

Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall, Members of the Committee, thank you
for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative
Amendments  Act  of  2008.  This  legislation  is  a  natural  follow-on  to  the  America
COMPETES  Act  signed  into  law  last  summer,  and  we  thank  this  committee  for
playing such a critical leadership role in that effort.

Texas  Instruments  (TI)  has  a  78-year  history  of  innovation.  While  our  products
have  changed  many  times  over  the  years,  we  have  always  fundamentally  been  a
company of engineers and scientists. We have always looked to the future by invest-
ing in R&D. Based in Dallas, TI has become the world’s third largest semiconductor
company. TI is focused on developing new electronics that make the world smarter,
healthier, safer, greener and more fun.

I  am  also  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  Semiconductor  Industry  Association  (SIA).
SIA  has  represented  America’s  semiconductor  industry  since  1977.  The  U.S.  semi-
conductor  industry  has  46  percent  of  the  $257  billion  world  semiconductor  market.
The  semiconductor  industry  employs  216,000  people  across  the  U.S.,  and  is  Amer-
ica’s second largest export sector.

While  my  testimony  today  focuses  directly  on  the  draft  National  Nanotechnology
Initiative Amendments Act, please note that TI strongly supports the testimony pre-
sented  last  month  to  the  Subcommittee  on  Research  and  Science  Education  by  Dr.
Jeff  Welser,  Director  of  the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative  (NRI)  at  the  Semi-
conductor  Research  Corporation  on  assignment  from  IBM.  TI  is  an  active  member
of  the  NRI,  as  well  as  the  Semiconductor  Research  Corporation  and  the  Semicon-
ductor Industry Association.

Nanotechnology holds the promise of solving a number of major challenges facing
our country, in areas such as energy, health care, and security. Nanotechnology re-
search  is  extremely  interdisciplinary,  bringing  together  any  combination  of  biolo-
gists,  chemists,  electrical  engineers,  physicists,  medical  doctors  and  materials  sci-
entists. This interdisciplinary nature is one of the reasons that it is essential federal
research  agencies  be  encouraged  to  work  collaboratively 
field  of
nanotechnology.

in  the 

The  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  signed  into  law
in  2003  created  the  mechanism  to  coordinate  federal  research  agencies  on  a  major
scale around this subject. The creation of the National Nanotechnology Coordinating
Office (NNCO) provided a focal point of these federal activities, leading to the devel-
opment of strategic plans that identified program component areas, and brought to-
gether key stakeholders for workshops on major nanotechnology topics.

The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act  of  2008  expands  upon
the foundation of the original legislation to improve interagency activities on critical
nanotechnology  research.  Section  2  contains  a  number  of  elements  that  would  en-
hance  the  way  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  is  planned  and  imple-
mented.  Using  the  NNI  strategic  plan  to  establish  clear  metrics  and  time  frames
for  both  near-  and  long-term  objectives,  including  plans  for  technology  transition
with  industry  and  the  states,  allows  better  measurement  of  progress  towards  NNI
goals. The explicit funding mechanism for the NNCO and authorization of travel ex-
penditures are also positive proposals for improving the way the NNI is planned and
implemented.  The  modifications  to  the  Advisory  Panel  will  allow  a  more  direct  role
for  industry  input  and  specific  focus  on  nanotechnology.  While  PCAST  has  ad-
dressed  nanotechnology  on  a  detailed  level,  it  also  has  a  vast  scope  of  work  in  a
range of other areas.

My  testimony  today  will  focus  on  two  core  aspects  that  TI  and  the  U.S.  semicon-
ductor  industry  see  as  key  components  to  the  legislation:  identification  of  areas  of
national importance and the translation of basic research into innovations that can
be commercialized. These are essential to ensuring that the NNI program maintains
U.S. leadership in nanotechnology.

Areas of National Importance (Section 5)

The  draft  legislation’s  inclusion  of  ‘‘Areas  of  National  Importance’’  is  an  essential
element  to  the  bill.  The  identification  of  the  areas  specifically  named  in  the  bill  as
well  as  subsequently  by  the  Advisory  Panel,  will  facilitate  prioritization  of  inter-
agency  activity  and  resources  around  nanotechnology  research  that  addresses  the
most critical challenges facing our country. It is indeed appropriate with this legisla-
tion  for  Congress  to  set  some  initial  areas  of  national  importance,  with  flexibility
embodied  in  the  Advisory  Panel  to  identify  additional  areas.  The  legislation  impor-
tantly  recognizes  that  the  projects  in  these  areas  will  be  selected  on  a  merit  and
competitive basis.

The draft bill identifies electronics, health care, energy, and water purification as
initial areas of national importance. TI and the U.S. semiconductor industry are en-
couraged  that  electronics  is  the  first  area  listed,  and  strongly  advocate  that  it  be
renamed nanoelectronics and that the reference be retained in the final bill.

The  semiconductor  industry  makes  major  contributions  to  the  U.S.  economy.
Semiconductor price reductions and performance improvements have driven produc-
tivity.  Semiconductors  drive  the  information  technology  sector,  which  has  contrib-
uted  to  25  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  since  1995  while  only
making  up  three  percent  of  GDP.  U.S.  semiconductor  companies  are  technology
leaders, capturing nearly half of the over $250 billion worldwide market.

As Dr. Welser testified, nanoelectronics research is needed to advance the current
semiconductor  technology  to  its  ultimate  limits,  and  to  examine  nanoelectronics  al-
ternatives to go beyond those limits, which will probably be reached by around 2020.
Progress in nanoelectronics is essential to continued advances in information and
communications, enabling breakthroughs in applications that depend on rapidly ac-
cessing  huge  volumes  of  data  and  increasing  the  speed  of  computations  with  that
data,  such  as  improved  mapping  of  the  human  genome  and  protein  folding,  pre-
dicting  the  path  of  hurricanes,  and  modeling  the  behavior  of  nanomaterials  and
nanoparticles.  There  is  no  doubt  that  nanoelectronics  will  play  a  key  role  in  essen-
tially  every  area  of  national  importance,  such  as  energy,  health  care,  and  national
security.

In  addressing  energy  challenges,  nanoelectronics  and  nanostructured  materials
will  be  essential  to  developing  new  sources  as  well  as  to  greatly  improved  means
of  energy  harvesting,  storage,  distribution,  conservation,  scavenging,  and  explo-
ration. Nanostructured materials are already showing promise for low-cost, high-ef-
ficiency  solar  cells,  fuel  cells,  super  capacitors,  batteries,  and  light-emitting  diodes
(LEDs).

As  our  country  faces  rising  health  care  costs  for  a  growing  and  aging  population,
the  application  of  nanotechnology  to  medical  diagnoses  and  treatments  will  be  crit-
ical. Advances in nanoelectronics, and nanotechnology more broadly, can lead to less
invasive  procedures,  better  imaging  and  monitoring,  and  targeted  treatment  at  the
cellular level (e.g., cancer).

Security is another major area of national importance. Even if the Committee de-
cides not to address this area in the legislation, this topic should certainly be promi-
nent  in  the  interagency  context.  Further  progress  in  nanoelectronics  will  continue
to  benefit  national  security  in  very  many  ways,  including  even  smarter  weapons,
better  and  quicker  situational  awareness,  and  a  broad  range  of  small  sensors  such
as single-chip chemical and biological analysis platforms.

Models and Resources Required to Address National Areas

Collaboration  among  Federal  and  State  government,  industry,  and  academia  will
be  essential  in  addressing  the  application  of  nanotechnology  to  national  challenges,
through partnerships such as the NRI. The NRI currently supports university basic
research in nanoelectronics at 35 universities and four regional centers. NRI efforts
are  primarily  focused  on  finding  a  new  switch  with  improved  speed,  energy  effi-
ciency, and/or cost compared to the field-effect transistor, which is today’s workhorse
for  processing  information.  The  National  Science  Foundation  also  recognized  this
nanoelectronics challenge in its 2009 budget request by including a $20M initiative
for research addressing ‘‘Science and Engineering Beyond Moore’s Law.’’

The  NRI  started  as  a  result  of  the  semiconductor  industry  recognizing  that  uni-
versity  research  in  nanoelectronics  must  be  accelerated.  In  2005,  Advanced  Micro
Devices,  Freescale,  IBM,  Intel,  Micron  Technology,  and  Texas  Instruments  all
agreed  to  provide  industry  funds  to  form  a  consortium  that  would  fund  university
research  in  nanoelectronics.  From  the  beginning,  it  was  clear  that  the  scope  of  the
challenge  and  basic  science  questions  involved  would  require  engagement  and  re-
sources  from  the  Federal  Government,  and  conversations  began  with  NSF  and
NIST.

NRI  is  a  model  collaboration  that  leverages  funding  and  expertise  from  industry,
NSF,  and  NIST,  and  contributions  from  State  and  local  governments.  To  quote  the
most  recent  NNI  strategic  plan  profile  of  the  NRI,  ‘‘these  government-industry-aca-
demic  partnerships  blend  the  discovery  mission  of  NSF,  the  technology  innovation
mission  of  NIST,  the  practical  perspective  of  industry,  and  the  technical  expertise
of U.S. universities to address a nanotechnology research and development priority.
It  is  one  example  of  the  creative  methods  the  NNI  uses  to  accelerate  research  that
contributes to the Nation’s economic competitiveness.’’ We are pleased that the draft
legislation recognizes and encourages such models in Section 5.

An  extremely  valuable  addition  to  the  reporting  requirement  in  Section  5  would
be to track investments in the areas of national interest, at the same level of detail

as  is  currently  done  for  the  Program  Component  Areas.  This  information  is  cur-
rently  disaggregated  across  agencies  and  extremely  difficult  to  obtain  and  compile.
For  example,  there  is  no  central  location  to  determine  overall  federal  investments
in nanoelectronics research, and certainly not on a fiscal year-to-year basis to deter-
mine trends.

To  pursue  critical  research  in  the  areas  of  national  importance,  universities  and
federal labs such as NIST will need adequate resources in terms of research funding
and  necessary  equipment/relating  operating  costs—this  should  be  recognized  in  the
bill.  While  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act  of  2008  estab-
lishes an important framework, corresponding appropriations will need to follow. TI
and  many  of  our  colleagues  in  the  U.S.  semiconductor  industry  have  been  among
the leaders in the business community advocating for appropriations to meet the re-
search  levels  established  by  the  America  COMPETES  Act,  House  Democratic  Inno-
vation Agenda, and the President’s American Competitiveness Agenda.

Research to Commercialization (Sections 4 and 6)

The  Federal  Government  is  uniquely  positioned  to  fund  basic  research.  Histori-
cally,  it  has  been  the  primary  source  of  basic  research  funds  for  universities.  The
Federal  Government  plays  an  especially  important  role  in  supporting  higher-risk,
exploratory  research  for  which  the  economic  benefits  may  not  be  realized  for  dec-
ades.

We applaud the Committee for recognizing that appropriate critical areas of basic
research  must  have  a  mechanism  for  translating  research  into  commercial  applica-
tions. This must be balanced with sustained emphasis on continuing the exploratory
research itself, which is required to answer remaining fundamental questions in the
science and engineering of nanotechnology. We believe that industry can play an im-
portant  role  in  establishing  this  balance  by  providing  insights  on  appropriate  goals
and  needs  for  both  ‘‘directed’’  basic  research  and  its  potential  commercialization.
This  input  can  be  provided  through  the  revised  Advisory  Panel,  consortia,  and  var-
ious industry advisory liaisons’ input into federal agency merit review processes. Di-
rect  agency  partnership  through  pre-competitive  industry  consortia  is  one  of  the
best  mechanisms  to  achieve  close  industry-government  collaboration  and  facilitate
commercialization of promising research.

Nanomanufacturing

The  language  in  Section  6  calling  for  instrumentation  and  tools  for  nanoscale
manufacturing  is  an  important  one  for  the  semiconductor  industry.  As  we  move  to
nanoelectronics,  measurement,  or  metrology,  challenges  will  only  increase.  NIST  is
best suited to address these challenges given its mission of metrology and its labora-
tory resources.

Using  the  NRI  research  as  an  example,  the  new  nanoelectronics  switch  must  be
extremely  reliable,  fast,  low  power,  functionally  dense,  and  capable  of  being  manu-
factured  in  commercial  volumes  at  low  cost.  There  are  a  number  of  candidates  for
the  new  nanoelectronics  switch,  including  devices  based  on  spin  or  other  quantum
state variables rather than classical bulk electric charge. Commercialization of such
devices into a new class of integrated circuits may very well require an entirely new
nanomanufacturing paradigm.

Role of the States

Section 4 of the draft legislation highlights technology transfer and explicitly iden-
tifies the important role of State leverage through research, development, and tech-
nology transfer initiatives.

We agree that State governments should play an important role in leveraging fed-
eral  funds  and  facilitating  commercialization  from  universities  to  industry.  For  ex-
ample, Texas created a $200 million Emerging Technology Fund. The fund has three
goals:  invest  in  public-private  endeavors  around  emerging  scientific  or  technology
fields  tied  to  competitiveness;  match  federal  and  other  sponsored  investment  in
science; and attract and enhance research talent superiority in Texas. Several other
states  have  similar  mechanisms.  Of  course,  State  governments  are  also  critical  in
supporting public research universities from an overall budget perspective.

As  part  of  the  establishment  of  the  third  regional  NRI  center,  the  Southwest
Academy  of  Nanoelectronics  (SWAN),  the  State  of  Texas,  the  University  of  Texas
System,  and  Texas  industry  collaborated  to  establish  a  complementary  package  of
leveraged support. The resulting $30 million of matching funds is focused on attract-
ing and supporting top academic researchers in nanoelectronics. Specifically, this is
a  three-way  match,  with  the  State  of  Texas  contributing  $10  million  from  the
Emerging Technology Fund, the University of Texas System matching with $10 mil-

69

lion,  and  the  remaining  $10  million  being  contributed  by  Texas  industry  for  en-
dowed chairs, including $5 million from TI.

The other regional NRI centers provide similar State and local leverage to indus-
try,  NSF,  and  NIST  funds.  Overall,  states  are  contributing  approximately  $15  mil-
lion annually to the NRI in funding, equipment, and endowments, in addition to the
major  investments  in  new  buildings.  New  York  has  provided  significant  research
funding  for  the  Institute  for  Nanoelectronics  Discovery  and  Engineering  (INDEX),
as  well  as  a  major  expansion  of  the  College  of  Nanoscale  Science  and  Engineering
Complex  in  Albany.  The  State  of  Georgia,  a  partner  in  INDEX  through  Georgia
Tech,  has  provided  new  facilities.  The  Western  Institute  of  Nanoelectronics  (WIN)
Center  has  leveraged  funds  through  the  University  of  California’s  Discovery  pro-
gram. The recently-established Midwest Academy for Nanoelectronics and Architec-
tures  (MANA)  at  Notre  Dame  has  attracted  Indiana  State  funds  and  even  city  re-
sources  from  South  Bend,  as  well  as  a  commitment  to  a  nanoelectronics  building
and adjacent innovation park for commercialization activities.

While  the  states  have  provided  these  resources  to  the  four  regional  NRI  centers,
it  is  important  to  note  that  the  regional  centers  are  ‘‘virtual’’  and  involve  research-
ers from several universities outside these states, thus the local investments benefit
research on a national level.

The  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology  issued  a  five-year
assessment report on the NNI in 2005. One of the recommendations was to increase
federal  cooperation  with  the  states,  especially  by  leveraging  State  research  invest-
ments.  Further,  the  report  recognized  the  important  role  of  states  in  commer-
cializing  nanotechnology  research  results.  We  agree  with  these  conclusions  and  en-
dorse  the  draft  legislation’s  emphasis  on  the  role  of  the  states  in  nanotechnology.

Conclusion

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative
Amendments  Act  of  2008.  The  draft  bill  makes  a  number  of  improvements  to  the
planning  and  implementation  of  the  NNI.  We  strongly  support  the  focus  on  areas
of  national  interest,  and  specifically  the  language  on  nanoelectronics.  The  trans-
lation  of  basic  research  to  commercialization  must  occur  to  ensure  that  the  NNI
maximizes  the  contributions  to  U.S.  economic  competitiveness  and  maintains  our
country’s leadership in nanotechnology. TI and the semiconductor industry look for-
ward to continuing to work closely with the Committee as this bill proceeds towards
final passage.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBERT R. DOERING

Dr. Doering is a Senior Fellow and Technology Strategy Manager at Texas Instru-
ments. He is also a member of TI’s Technical Advisory Board. His previous positions
at  TI  include:  Manager  of  Future-Factory  Strategy,  Director  of  Scaled-Technology
Integration,  and  Director  of  the  Microelectronics  Manufacturing  Science  and  Tech-
nology  (MMST)  Program.  The  MMST  Program  was  a  five-year  R&D  effort,  funded
by  DARPA,  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  and  Texas  Instruments,  which  developed  a  wide
range  of  new  technologies  for  advanced  semiconductor  manufacturing.  The  major
highlight  of  the  program  was  the  demonstration,  in  1993,  of  sub-three-day  cycle
time  for  manufacturing  350-nm  CMOS  integrated  circuits.  This  was  principally  en-
abled by the development of 100 percent single-wafer processing.

He  received  a  B.S.  degree  in  physics  from  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Tech-
nology  in  1968  and  a  Ph.D.  in  physics  from  Michigan  State  University  in  1974.  He
joined  TI  in  1980,  after  several  years  on  the  faculty  of  the  Physics  Department  at
the  University  of  Virginia.  His  physics  research  was  on  nuclear  reactions  and  was
highlighted  by  the  discovery  of  the  Giant  Spin-Isospin  Resonance  in  heavy  nuclei
in 1973 and by pioneering experiments in medium-energy heavy-ion reactions in the
late  70’s.  His  early  work  at  Texas  Instruments  was  on  SRAM,  DRAM,  and  NMOS/
CMOS  device  physics  and  process-flow  design.  Management  responsibilities  during
his  first  10  years  at  TI  included  advanced  lithography  and  plasma  etch  as  well  as
CMOS and DRAM technology development.

Dr.  Doering  is  an  IEEE  Fellow  and  Chair  of  the  Semiconductor  Manufacturing
Technical Committee of the IEEE Electron Devices Society. He represents Texas In-
struments  on  many  industry  committees,  including:  the  Technology  Strategy  Com-
mittee  of  the  Semiconductor  Industry  Association,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the
Semiconductor  Research  Corporation,  the  Governing  Council  of  the  Focus  Center
Research  Program,  the  Governing  Council  of  the  Focus  Center  Research  Program,
the Governing Council of the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, and the Corporate
Associates Advisory Committee of the American Institute of Physics. Dr. Doering is

pers/talks and has 20 U.S. patents.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Doering.  You  are  absolutely
right. We have got to do more than authorize. We have also got to
follow up with those appropriations. Thank you.

At  this  point,  we  will  open  ourselves  for  the  first  round  of  ques-
tions, and the Chair recognizes himself. There has been a lot of dis-
cussion  this  morning  about  health  and  safety,  environmental  con-
cerns about nanotechnology. Let me tell you the reasons that I am
particularly concerned about that. One is my seven-year-old daugh-
ter,  and  I  know  all  of  us  have  reasons  of  some  nature,  that  same
interest.  The  other  is  I  want  to  make  sure  that  America  gets  as
much  bang  for  the  buck  of  our  investment  as  we  can.  I  want  us
to  be  first  to  market.  I  want  us  to  be  able  to  create  jobs  in  this
country  built  around  nanotechnology.  And  as  a  son  of  a  farmer,  I
am  haunted  to  some  extent  about  what  I  have  seen  with  geneti-
cally  altered  grain.  I  have  seen  how  it  has  been  rejected,  even
though  in  my  opinion  we  have  had  good  research  to  the  contrary
around  the  world.  I  don’t  want  that  to  happen  here.  I  think  that
means we have got to get out in front. There are already 600 prod-
ucts  on  the  market,  and  it  concerns  me  that  we  are  going  to  have
a  horror  story  with  one  out  of  600,  and  it  could  put  a  taint  on  the
entire industry.

For  that  reason,  the  draft  bill  requires  that  10  percent  of  the
NNI’s  total  funding  be  designated  for  the  environmental,  health,
and  safety  research  component  area  there  at  NNI.  This  would  be
about  $150  million  under  the  current  2009  request.  Now,  this  is  a
provision that has been really recommended by a number of compa-
nies within industry, academia, NGO. It is consistent with the Na-
tional Academy of Science 2006 review of NNI. But it is not unani-
mous,  and  Mr.  Kvamme,  you  have  stated,  and  I  will  quote,  that  it
is  misguided  and  may  have  the  unintended  consequence  of  reduc-
ing  research  on  beneficial  applications  and  on  risk.  So  let  me  ask
you,  do  you  feel  like  your  panel  is  satisfied  with  the  current  level
of funding on health, environment, and safety?

Mr.  KVAMME.  Well,  as  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  we  in  our
report, we call for increased spending in that area and particularly
since  the  industry  is  picking  up  more  and  more  research  funding
in  the  nano  area,  we  think  the  Government’s  role  will  in  fact
change. As you know very well, the 2009——

Chairman GORDON. Change in what direction?
Mr. KVAMME. In an increasing direction. In the 2009 request——
Chairman  GORDON.  In  an  increasing  direction?  You  said  it  was

going to change. From what to what?

Mr.  KVAMME.  More  spending  in  the  EHS  area  is  requested  and
is happening. It is roughly double of 2006 numbers from $37 to $76
million in the 2009 area. So I think that will happen.

Chairman GORDON. Did your panel discuss an appropriate level?
Mr.  KVAMME.  We  talked  about  what  is  happening  and  what  is
the strategy behind what is happening. We have not yet completed

review  of  the  NEHI  report  because  it  just  came  out  in  February,
we  looked  more  at  what  activities  are  in  that  we  believe  that  the
activities called for in that report and the subsequent EPA research
strategy  are  appropriate  things  to  fund,  and  we  believe  that  these
funding levels can support that level of research.

Chairman GORDON. So would it be fair to say that you’re not sat-
isfied  with  the  current  level,  think  there  should  be  additional
spending but do not want to put a specific 10 percent——

Mr.  KVAMME.  I  think  that  is  a  fair  statement.  Namely,  we  have
encouraged  the  increased  spending  in  this  area.  Now,  the  par-
ticular  area  that  we  do  call  out  that  we  haven’t  mentioned  yet  is
in NIOSH. We believe that the workplace is the most critical area,
and  we  do  call  for  an  acceleration  of  the  funding  in  the  NIOSH
area.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  know  some  the  witnesses  have  a  contrary
view,  and  so  what  I  would  like  to  do  is  for  each  of  the  witnesses
to respond to Mr. Kvamme’s statement and see what recommenda-
tion  you  would  have.  And  so  we  will  start  and  just  go  straight
down.

Mr.  MURDOCK.  As  I  said  earlier,  we  don’t  know  the  exact  appro-
priate level for this funding. We think 10 percent is ultimately rea-
sonable  estimate  but  that  should  be  determined  by  strategic  plan-
ning process. I think Ray David, Dr. David mentioned the National
Academy’s BEST study which we have also supported to figure out
what that number is. I think it is also important that we continue
to make the investments in some of the characterization in metrol-
ogy  equipment,  the  measurement  techniques  in  particular  for  the
workplace exposure. Absolutely.

Chairman  GORDON.  If  there  was  a  strategic  review  that  deter-
mined  that  there  should  be  a  base-level  funding,  you  would  go
along with that?

Mr. MURDOCK. Correct.
Chairman GORDON. Go ahead, sir.
Dr. KRAJCIK. You know, this really isn’t my area of expertise, so

I will pass on comments with respect to this question.

Chairman  GORDON.  As  my  mother  said,  if  you  don’t  have  some-
thing good to say, just don’t say anything at all. That is a good pol-
icy to follow. Yes, Doctor?

Dr.  MAYNARD.  Let  me  just  start  by  saying  I  very  much  agree
with  Mr.  Kvamme  that  NIOSH  is  one  of  those  agencies  that  is
doing  tremendous  work  with  virtually  no  dollars  to  do  it,  and  that
is  a  critical  area  where  more  investment  is  needed  if  we  are  going
to make real progress toward developing safe nanotechnologies.

If  you  look  at  funding  in  general,  one  thing  I  think  is  indis-
putable.  We  need  more  money  to  do  targeted  H&S  research.  If  we
don’t  have  more  money,  we  will  not  get  the  answers  that  people
need in order to make good decisions. And that means you have got
to  set  some  sort  of  guidelines,  and  you  can  do  it  one  of  two  ways.
You  can  either  set  a  baseline  level,  say  $100  million,  $150  million
a  year  which  are  the  figures  that  are  being  recommended,  or  you
can set it as a percentage of the overall funding for nanotechnology
research. I actually think it makes it simpler to set that 10 percent
level,  and  it  is  a  reasonable  level.  Any  less  than  that,  it  is  really

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:09 Sep 22, 2008 Jkt 041672 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\041608\41672 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

72

hard  to  see  how  we  are  going  to  get  the  information  we  need  in
order to ensure the safety and success of these technologies.

But that funding has got to be allayed with a strategy. You can-
not  just  look  at  the  dollars.  You  have  got  to  understand  where
those  dollars  are  going,  what  you  are  going  to  achieve  with  them,
and if you don’t have that strategy, if you don’t have that account-
ability,  you  could  put  $100  million,  $200  million  per  year  in  this
area and achieve absolutely nothing.

Chairman GORDON. Dr. David.
Dr. DAVID. I think Andrew has made some very good points, and
I  agree  with  him.  I  think  it  is  very  difficult  to  come  up  with  an
exact figure and certainly a percentage probably is the most appro-
priate  way  to  approach  it.  Whether  10  percent  is  the  correct  num-
ber  or  some  other  percentage,  I  think  that  that  is  a  difficult  ques-
tion  to  answer  without  having  some  external  recommendation.  I
can  tell  you  that  within  industry,  companies  can  spend  anywhere
from  two  to  five  percent  of  their  budget  on  R&D  efforts.  Pharma-
ceutical companies, it is 15 percent. And that simply is a reflection
of  the  kinds  of  products  that  they  are  generating  or  what  is  re-
quired to determine that those products are safe for consumer uses.
And  so  10  percent  lies  somewhere  in  between  that  number  and  is
probably  as  reasonable  a  starting  point  as  any.  But  I  think  it  is
probably  an  excellent  idea  to  have  the  National  Academies  come
back with an actual recommendation. That seems to make the most
sense to me.

Chairman  GORDON.  Just  for  your  information,  a  part  of  the  bill
does set forth a strategic plan that we will develop for each agency.
And  so  we  hope  to  get  that  good  advice,  and  the  Academy  is  re-
viewing that plan now.

And finally, Dr. Doering.
Dr. DOERING. The semiconductor industry is certainly very inter-
ested in ESH and feels it is an important topic. The SI in fact has
a committee on environmental safety and health. The industry has
two  R&D  consortia  in  the  United  States,  the  Semiconductor  Re-
search  Corporation  as  well  as  Semitech  which  co-fund  a  center  on
environmentally  benign  manufacturing  for  semiconductors  at  the
University of Arizona. It has partner universities around the coun-
try  that  are  part  of  that  center  as  well.  In  addition,  the  Inter-
national  Technology  Roadmap  for  Semiconductors,  which  is  a  very
detailed  document,  approximately  1,000  pages  of  the  research
needs that we have for our industry, the pre-competitive needs, has
a  whole  chapter  on  environmental  safety  and  health  which  goes
into  a  lot  of  detail  on  very  specific  things,  including  some  in  the
area of nanoelectronics.

However, we haven’t really done the kind of analysis that would
put  any  particular  number  on  what  this  need  is.  I  definitely  agree
with  most  everyone  else  that  some  kind  of  analysis  is  appropriate
to figure out what the plan would call for in terms of a figure, but
the semiconductor industry can’t suggest any number at this point.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  and  Dr.  Ehlers,  excuse  me  for
running  over  time,  and  that  certainly  will  extend  to  you  or  others
that might have a threshold question like that.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you.  I  timed  it  at  30  minutes.  Seriously,  a
lot  of  good  questions,  good  answers.  But  I  would  just  like  to  thin

this down a bit. First of all, how does the 10 percent, singling that
out,  how  is  it  going  to  affect  the  other  research  that  is  done?  Mr.
Kvamme,  I  would  like  to  have  you  give  me  some  overview  of  how
you  see  this  working.  Let  me  add  another  question  to  the  mix.  So
many  different  agencies  and  organizations  involved.  We  are  using
different bookkeeping methods. How are we going to specify the 10
percent and make sure that it is fairly administered? The two ques-
tions,  how  do  you  do  it  and  how  do  you  administer  it  fairly?  Sec-
ondly, what impact is that likely to have on the other research pro-
grams out there?

Mr.  KVAMME.  Well,  let  me  try  the  second  one  first.  That  is  part
of  the  reason  I  inserted  the  graph  that  I  did  in  my  written  state-
ment which lists the 13 agencies that do EHS research against the
five different question areas that the NEHI Report outlined as the
questions.  It  seems  to  me  what  would  have  to  happen,  and  I  am
no  authority  on  governmental  processes  or  appropriations  or  those
kinds  of  things.  That  is  not  where  I  come  from.  But  it  seems  like
what  you  would  then  have  to  do  is  go  down  the  13  agencies  and
essentially  say,  okay,  NIH,  you  have  got  to  spend  6.7  percent,  and
NIST,  you  have  got  to  spend  X  percent  and  EPA,  you  have  got  to
spend  18.7  percent,  et  cetera.  You  would  have  to  do  something  be-
cause  they  set  the  goals.  Somebody  would  have  to  then  sum  the
total and say, we are at 9.6 percent, we need 0.4 percent and twist
NSF’s  arm  to  increase  their  thing  a  bit  or  something  like  that.  I
don’t  understand  that  process.  That  is  not  what  I  am  saying.  So  I
think  that  is  the  practical  issue  that  I  see  from  our  analysis  be-
cause  you  have  to  understand,  these  organizations  voluntarily
joined  the  NNI.  And  in  the  early  days  of  our  first  report,  we  were
twisting arms to get people to become part of the program to start
with. And by the way, are still twisting a couple of arms which we
think  are  important  to  join,  so  the  Department  of  Education  will
come along.

So  I  think  that  is  an  issue  relative  to  how  you  would  do  it,  but
that  is  in  your  hands.  I  just  point  that  out  as  the  practical  thing.
Now,  obviously  the  other  issue  that  you  have  is  the  $1.5  billion
supports  a  lot  of  buildings,  a  lot  of  instrumentation,  a  lot  of  other
kinds  of  things.  If  you  actually  talk  about  dollars  and  cents  going
to  researchers,  the  numbers,  the  $76  million  that  is  talked  about
now  is  probably  pretty  close  to  a  high  single-digit  number.  I  can’t
say  a  specific  number  because  I  don’t  have  that  breakout  at  my
hands,  but  it  would  obviously  mean  that  the  other  research  would
be .9 of what it has been.

But the other point that I would make that I think is very, very
important  to  realize  is  that  the  applications  research  embodies
EHS research in a number of areas. For example, at NIH, with our
discussions  with  them,  they  have  to  worry  about  the  health  impli-
cations.  The  example  I  like  to  use  is  in  isolation,  nobody  would
agree  to  chemotherapy.  It  is  not  good  for  you.  The  plus  is  that  it
does good stuff. It eliminates cancer cells. And so you have to have
that balance. Now, if you are working on a chemotherapy drug, are
you  working  on  EHS  issues  or  are  you  working  on  cancer  cures?
That is a tough question to answer. And how many dollars are you
allocating to the EHS piece of what you are doing versus the appli-
cation  piece.  The  way  the  numbers  are  done  now,  and  I  am  sure

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:09 Sep 22, 2008 Jkt 041672 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\041608\41672 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

74

the  way  Andrew  came  up  with  $13  million  he  says  zero,  I  would
suspect, for the EHS piece in that research. I don’t happen to agree
with that assessment, and I think the $68 million in 2006 is accu-
rate.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you.  A  good  example,  your  cancer  case.  I
don’t  know  if  you  saw  the  60  Minutes  program  Sunday  evening
where  they  were  injecting  gold  nanoparticles  into  patients,  which
are selectively absorbed by the cancer cells, then using radio waves
to heat them up and destroying the cells.

Mr. KVAMME. Amazing stuff.
Mr.  EHLERS.  It  is  a  classic  example  of  exactly  what  you  were
talking  about.  No  one  knew  what  the  impact  would  be,  and  it  will
take considerable time to find out.

I  appreciate  your  comments  on  that.  Dr.  Maynard,  in  a  similar
vein, you said you are not sure how these decisions are made, who
decides?  Dr.  Maynard,  you  said  you  need  leadership  from  the  top.
What do you mean by the top?

Dr. MAYNARD. Somewhere above the federal agencies themselves,
probably  within  OSTP.  And  I  say  that  in  going  back  to  your  ques-
tion of how could you make this 10 percent work? You can see ways
you  could  make  it  work  if  you  actually  had  somebody  at  the  top
level  who  was  working  with  the  agencies  to  ensure  that  that  10
percent  funding  was  actually  being  correctly  allocated  across  the
agencies.  So  you  have  got  a  partnership  there.  But  that  partner-
ship would only occur and only succeed if you had coordination and
leadership  from  the  highest  possible  level  within  government.  So
that is what I was thinking about in terms of leadership. It is actu-
ally  making  sure  that  somebody  is  pulling  the  process  forward
rather  than  it  being  pushed  forward  from  the  bottom  up,  in  which
case you have got—it is pretty much lost whether you are going to
do  the  right  thing  or  the  wrong  thing  there.  At  least  with  leader-
ship  you  are  sure  you  are  heading  in  something  approximating  to
the right dimension.

I  would  also,  if  you  will  allow  me,  like  to  address  the  issue  of
what  research  is  being  done  in  the  area  of  EHS  issues  and  also
whether that will impact on looking at the development of applica-
tions research and basic research.

This is a critical issue because there is no point in funding basic
research and applications research if we get the risk side of things
wrong.  We  just  will  not  see  any  of  that  translate  into  viable  prod-
ucts.  So  we  have  got  to  put  a  realistic  amount  of  our  investment,
our  research  investment,  into  understanding  the  risks.  Now,  the
way we do that has got to be fairly sophisticated, and Mr. Kvamme
was  right.  My  $13  million  is  specifically  looking  at  questions  that
ask  things  like  if  you  have  this  titanium  dioxide,  how  am  I  going
to use it safely. That is a question you won’t find answered by look-
ing  at  cancer  research.  It  is  a  question  you  would  only  answer  by
asking very specific questions. But you have got to be more sophis-
ticated  than  that.  You  have  also  got  to  look  at  how  other  areas  of
research  can  be  applied  to  understanding  environmental,  safety,
and  health.  And  if  you  look  at  our  written  testimony,  we  actually
delve  into  that  level  of  sophistication.  But  the  first  and  foremost
thing we need to do is ask the obvious questions. How can you en-
sure  the  nanotechnologies  being  developed  now  are  as  safe  as  pos-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:09 Sep 22, 2008 Jkt 041672 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\041608\41672 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

75

sible?  We  will  not  do  that  by  trying  to  tag  along  to  applications-
based  research.  We  have  got  to  ask  those  specific  questions,  and
that is what is not being done at the moment.

Mr. EHLERS. Dr. Krajcik, I just wanted to make a brief comment.
Since  I  have  spent  so  much  of  my  life  trying  to  improve  math  and
science education, I agree with your comments. This is another ex-
ample  of  an  area  where  we  desperately  need  education.  I  can  see
all  kinds  of  horror  stories  getting  propagated  through  the  media
about  nanotechnology  based  on  some  incidents  that  might  happen
in the future, and the public just doesn’t have the capability to de-
cide. So education certainly has to be an important part of this.

One last question. Dr. David, in your testimony, you commented,
we need to, you had a whole list of things we need to do. My ques-
tion  is,  who  is  going  to  pay  for  it?  Would  you  expect  industry  to
carry  this  out?  Do  you  think  that  we  should  appropriate  money  to
do all those different things?

Dr.  DAVID.  I  think  it  has  to  be  a  coalition.  I  think  that  it  has  to
be  a  coalition  of  industry,  of  government-sponsored  programs  that
support  academia,  or  support  programs  within  the  various  federal
agencies.  The  task  can  be  so  enormous  and  some  of  the  develop-
ment  of  technology  can  be  so  daunting  that  I  think  it  will  require
that  kind  of  coalition  in  order  to  get  the  answers  that  we  need  to
do, at least in a timely fashion.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you  all  for  your  responses,  your  testimony.
I  was  fascinated  with  this  topic  because  it  has  such  enormous  po-
tential,  and  it  can  change  our  lives  in  ways  we  can’t  imagine.  And
yet,  I  don’t  think  we  quite  have  a  handle  on  how  we  are  going  to
use it, what we are likely to find, and above all, what the dangers
are.  I  am  not  one  of  these  people  who  cries  wolf  at  every  corner,
but  I  am  afraid,  given  the  history  of  what  has  happened  with  pes-
ticides  and  other  things,  that  the  public  and  especially  the  public
service agencies or entities will be waiting to jump on the first inci-
dent  and  try  to  create  a  Three  Mile  Island  out  of  it.  So  we  face  a
very ticklish job here together, and I appreciate your willingness to
come here and help us understand it better.

Thank you.
Chairman GORDON. Ms. Hooley is recognized.
Ms.  HOOLEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair.  I,  too,  am  very  concerned
about  the  educational  piece.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  I  am
concerned  about  in  nanotechnology.  I  think  it  also  has  enormous
potential  for  the  future,  and  I  appreciate  all  of  you  being  here  to
testify today.

When we had a hearing on this last fall, several witnesses spoke
of the importance of early nanotechnology education for generating
awareness  and  excitement  about  nanotechnology,  particularly  for
young students and in fact the general public. Do you feel like this
legislation  accomplishes  those  two  goals,  how  the  general  public
views  nanotechnology?  Do  you  think  people  understand  what
nanotechnology  is?  What  kind  of  a  job  do  you  thin  we  are  doing
with  nanotechnology  in  our  schools?  Anyone  on  the  panel  that
would like to answer? Don’t be bashful.

Dr.  KRAJCIK.  I  think  we  have  a  long  ways  to  go.  I  think  some
of  the  fundamental  ideas  that  underlie  nanotechnology  our  society
is pretty naı´ve about. Most people don’t even understand where the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:09 Sep 22, 2008 Jkt 041672 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\041608\41672 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

nano-range lies. They have a hard time distinguishing—once some-
thing  gets  smaller  than  a  cell  or  a  hair,  it  is  undistinguishable.  It
is not there. So most of our children, most of our adult population,
does  not  understand  even  the  scale  that  we  are  talking  about,  let
alone  some  of  the  important  underlying  concepts.  The  wonderful
thing  about  nanotechnology  is  it  actually  brought  new  ideas  to  us.
Dr.  Maynard  raised  some  of  these.  We  now  know  that  when  you
get down to the nano level, materials now get new properties.

Ms. HOOLEY. Right.
Dr.  KRAJCIK.  Those  ideas  aren’t  even  in  our  science  textbooks.
We have science textbooks out there that don’t have those ideas in
them.  Kids  are  learning  that,  you  know,  properties  are  always  the
same.  They  don’t  learn  the  idea  that  as  you  change  scale,  prop-
erties change. We have a long way to go. Our country is in serious,
serious  trouble  when  it  comes  to  educating  our  children  and  the
population  with  respect  to  nanotechnology.  We  have  some  efforts,
you  know.  I  know  that  the  NISE  network,  informal  science  edu-
cation  group,  is  trying  to  do  something  through  the  museums,  the
Nanoscale  Center  for  Engineering  and  Science  is  doing  things,  but
we have a lot more that we have to be able to do because it is not
pervasive in our schools, it certainly does not appear in any of our
standards,  and  unless  it  gets  into  our  standards,  unless  we  start
testing  for  it,  we  are  not  going  to  see  it  in  schools.  So  we  have  a
long ways to go if we are really going to make a difference.

If  you  want  to  speak  about  safety,  our  kids  can’t  decide—you
know,  no  one  knows—you  mentioned  sunscreen.  We  don’t  know
when  you  put  this—you  know,  we  don’t  see  the  white  stuff  on  our
face anymore. That is good, we look nice when we are at the beach
and  it  keeps  away  the  ultraviolet  light,  but  we  don’t  know  if  it  is
harmful  to  us,  and  we  don’t  have  the  resources.  People  generally
don’t  have  the  resources  to  make  that  decision.  They  don’t  even
know,  should  I  be  worried  about  it?  That’s  a  problem.  You  know,
we can make the decision that, okay, I am going to put this on, and
it  might  penetrate  my  skin,  and  it  might  do  something  bad  to  me
30 years down the line. But people should be able to make that de-
cision,  and  right  now  they  don’t  have  the  intellectual  resources  to
even make those kind of decisions. So I think we have a lot of work
that we have to do to educate our country so we are more informed
citizens.

Ms.  HOOLEY.  What  is  the  one  thing  that  we  should  do  to  in  fact
make  the  public  more  aware,  make  sure  that  our  students  are
more  aware  of  nanotechnology,  of  what 
in
nanotechnology,  as  well  as  what  are  some  of  the  problems  with
nanotechnologies?

is  possible 

Dr.  KRAJCIK.  I  wish  I  could  say  it  was  one  thing.  It  isn’t.  It  is

a big complex system, right?

Ms. HOOLEY. You can give me two or three things, yeah.
Dr.  KRAJCIK.  So  that  is  what  I  tried  to  outline  very  clearly.  I
think  we  really  have  to  do  sustained  professional  development.  I
think we have to change our national science education standards.
They  did  our  country  good,  but  they  are  old,  and  they  need  to  get
revamped  with  new,  emerging  ideas  in  science.  We  have  to  have
new  instructional  materials.  We  have  to  provide  resources  for  our
classrooms  and  we  have  to  change  our  undergraduate  programs,

both  science  courses  but  also  our  teacher  preparation  programs.
Unless  we  do  all  these  things,  we  are  always  going  to  be  in  this
mess that we are in this country. We will never see ourselves back
in the forefront with respect to science.

Ms. HOOLEY. For any of the panelists, how involved do you think
businesses need to be in helping us reach the public in general and
our educational institutions. Dr. Maynard?

Dr.  MAYNARD.  Very  involved,  but  I  think  this  is  something  that
both business and government have got to be involved with simply
because  you  have  got  the  two  sides  of  education.  You  have  got  to
side of education where you are enthusing people so that they real-
ly understand and invest time and effort into nanotechnology to be-
come  the  next  generation  of  nanotechnologists.  But  also,  you  have
got  the  side  of  empowering  people  to  make  informed  decisions  and
actually  engage  in  the  process  of  nanotechnology  and  science  in  a
broader sense. That cannot all be done by industry. Some of it has
got  to  be  done  in  partnership  with  other  organizations  including
the government.

Ms. HOOLEY. I am just curious again——
Chairman  GORDON.  Ms.  Hooley,  if  you  don’t  mind,  I  am  sorry.
We are going to have to be a little stricter on our five minutes. We
are going to have votes in 10 or 15 minutes——

Ms. HOOLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I can take——
Chairman GORDON. And we will get back to you if we——
Ms. HOOLEY. I would love to just—want to have a dialogue.
Chairman  GORDON.  Oh,  this  is  very  important.  Hopefully,  this
will  be  the  start  of  an  ongoing  dialogue,  both  formal  and  informal.

Ms. Biggert, you are recognized for a crisp five minutes.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Murdock,  I  have
been  amazed  at  the  rapid  growth  of  nanotech  startups  in  my  dis-
trict,  many  of  which  I  think  you  are  familiar  with.  Many  of  these
startups  are  commercializing  nanotechnologies  developed  from
basic  nano  research  at  places  like  Northwestern  or  the  Center  for
Nano  Materials  at  Argon.  Do  these  start-ups  face  the  same  chal-
lenges that other small start-ups do, or are the challenges different
because  they  are  trying  to  build  business  around  nanotechnology?
Mr.  MURDOCK.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  believe  that  some  of  the
challenges are the same, and some are, I’ll call it more acute. These
start-ups  are  different  than  software  information  technology  based
start-ups.  They  require  more  capital,  and  they  require  a  much
longer  involvement  cycles.  You  know,  this  isn’t  a  business  model
that, you know when I was at Kellogg, friends could leave and start
a  company  and  scale  something  out  in  a  couple  years  on  a  couple
million dollars. It takes a lot longer, and it takes a lot more invest-
ment to make it go. And so we often talk about the Valley of Death,
the period between, you know, the formation of the company when
you  start  to  generate  revenues  and  cash  flows,  and  many  of  these
technologies  that  come  off,  whether  they  be  argon  federal  labora-
tories  where  the  start-ups  are  platform-oriented  technologies.  And
there  is  a  fair  amount  of  research  and  development  to  make  it  ro-
bust,  repeatable,  scalable,  and  all  those  wonderful  things  before
you can actually manufacture a product on it and create revenues.
And that is where, you know, programs like DSBR, STTR, and the
TIPR are very——

78

Ms.  BIGGERT.  So  do  you  think  that  the  tech  transfer  provisions

in the draft bill will address these unique challenges?

Mr. MURDOCK. I think that they will be helpful. I think there are
other—you know, I understand the SBIR reauthorization is coming
up  and  there  are  some  changes  in  that  program  that  will  also  be
helpful.  So  they  certainly  moved  the  needle  in  the  right  directly
and will help the efforts to commercialize these technologies.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Dr.  Doering,  do  you  think  that  the  bill  will  help

these challenges?

Dr.  DOERING.  One  of  the  aspects  that  hasn’t  been  mentioned  yet
with  regard  to  that  is  the  role  of  the  states  which  is  encouraged
by  the  bill.  The  states  obviously  have  a  lot  of  interest  in  creating
jobs  locally  and  new  business  locally.  And  as  I  mentioned  in  my
testimony,  we  have  had  some  success  through  our  consortia  in
working with the states, and I believe that role we need to continue
to encourage.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Again,  Mr.  Murdock,  Dr.  Doering,  there  has  been
a  lot  of  talk  today  about  what  the  government  can  and  should  be
doing and to what degree, 10 percent more or less, to address EHS
issue.  What  role  can  business  play,  and  what  role  should  business
play to address EHS issue and help American consumers better un-
derstand the health and safety implications of nanotech technology
and nano products themselves?

Mr.  MURDOCK.  If  I  could  respond  to  that  briefly,  obviously  busi-
nesses are responsible and accountable to make sure their products
are  safe.  That  is  true  for  nanotechnology,  that  is  true  with  every-
thing.  And  you  know,  the  member  companies—it  is  important  to
understand  that  most  of  these  companies  are  ultimately  in  the  re-
search  phase.  They  are  helping  a  prototype.  Most  of  these  tech-
nologies  are  not  yet  to  the  market,  but  they  need  to  do  the  safety
testing  and  they  do  based  upon  what  is  known  and  to  ensure  that
those are safe.

The  government,  you  know,  we  have  talked  about  needs  to  de-
velop  the  standards  and  the  characterization  protocols  if  you  will
to characterize these materials and the test methods to continue to
evolve  those  based  on  the  stated  science  to  having  our  best  under-
standing  of  what  is  in  fact  safe.  And  then  industry  needs  to  apply
that.

As  just  a  little  segue,  members  of  the  NanoBusiness  Alliance
have invited NIOSH to their facilities, to monitor, to take measure-
ments on the site of the air quality, to test for nanoparticulate mat-
ter  in  the  air.  Members  are  participating  in  the  EPA’s  voluntary
nanomaterials  stewardship  program.  And  so  there  are  businesses
engaging  in  those  ways  and  trying  to  help  provide  the  information
to improve our state of knowledge.

Ms. BIGGERT. Dr. Doering, do you have anything to add?
Dr.  DOERING.  Yes.  Speaking  for  the  semiconductor  industry,  as
I  had  mentioned  earlier,  we  take  ES&H  very  seriously.  Most  of  us
have  very  large  ES&H  departments  within  our  companies  that
work  closely  with  the  parts  of  the  Federal  Government  that  help
control  new  materials  generally,  whether  or  not  they  are  classified
as  nanotechnology.  As  new  nanomaterial  come  along,  we  take  a
very  hard  look  at  each  one  before  incorporating  them.  We  are  also
interested in the educational aspects on this. We primarily do that

in  collaboration  with  each  other  through  our  trade  association,  the
Semiconductor  Industry  Association  which  has  sponsored  some
studies  in  this  area.  And  we  would  be  glad  to  work  through  them,
and  the  Federal  Government,  in  any  further  education  a  program.
Ms. BIGGERT. I guess we have gotten over the Michael Creighton

book, Prey. Thank you very much. I yield back.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Biggert.  Thank  you.  Ms.

Woolsey is recognized.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  actually  sit  here
today  as  an  example  of  the  benefits  of  nanotechnology.  On  March
5th  I  had  huge  back  surgery.  Here  I  am,  back  at  work,  have  been
for  the  last  three  weeks,  and  I  have  some  of  the  brilliance  of  your
industry implanted in my back. So thank you very much.

I  agree  with  what  you  are  saying.  Luckily  we  have  three  Mem-
bers  on  this  committee,  myself,  Congressman  Ehlers,  and  Con-
gresswoman  Biggert  who  are  also  on  the  Education  and  Labor
Committees,  and  we  will  be  reauthorizing,  fixing,  making  better,
No  Child  Left  Behind.  Therefore,  I  was  looking  out  here,  you  are
a  beautiful  man,  you  are  great,  but  you  are  all  white,  you  are  all
within 10- or 15-year span there. We have got to get every kid and
every  young  person  involved  in  the  future  of  this  country  which  is
the new technologies, the nanotechnologies, the green technologies,
that  we  are  going  to  be  able  to  keep  in  this  country  hopefully,  not
come  up  with  all  the  good  ideas  in  science  and  then  give  it  away
to the rest of the world. We have to do that.

So,  I  am  going  to  tie  this  right  back  now  to  education  and  labor
and No Child Left Behind. I would like to know from you what has
your association, or what have you done yourselves in order to give
us feedback on what is missing in this picture? We have got to hear
it from you. Have you been participants?

Mr.  KVAMME.  If  I  could  make  a  couple  of  comments,  the  first
thing is open up. We live in a society—my parents were carpenters.
Yours were farmers, the Chairman indicated. You could know what
your parent did for a living. That is no longer true for many people
today. I had a unique experience some years ago which I will never
forget. We had our company picnic where 1,000 usually came of our
9,000  employees.  We  decided,  hold  it  in  the  plant,  have  an  open
house,  and  23,000  people  showed  up.  People  want  to  know  what
Mom  and  Dad  do  for  a  living,  and  we  don’t  do  that  very  well  in
our  industries,  and  we  don’t  do  it  because  of  legal  concerns,  insur-
ance  concerns,  et  cetera.  We  have  got  to  change  that.  We  have  got
to open up, and if there is any way legislation can do that, I highly
encourage it. I am no expert in legislation, but open up our compa-
nies so people don’t drive down some rows of buildings and haven’t
a clue what is going on in those buildings.

The second thing I would say is that when you are talking about
education,  you  have  got  to  be  careful.  This  is  the  point  I  tried  to
make  in  my  testimony  relative  to  nanotechnology  and  technology.
What we have found is people don’t go into technology, they go into
curing  cancer,  they  go  into  doing  better  energy  research.  They  go
into——

Ms. WOOLSEY. Fixing my back.
Mr. KVAMME.—going to the Moon. They go into application kinds
of  things,  and  nanotechnology  is  a  tool  to  that  end.  What  we  have

learned  at  the  University  of  California–Berkeley  where  I  serve  on
the  engineering  advisory  board  is  that  this  center  for  information
technology  in  the  interest  of  society,  CITRIS,  is  drawing  students
right  and  left  because  they  see  end  applications  for  getting  that
double-E degree, that ME degree, whatever degree it is. They want
to  see  societal  things.  I  think  as  you  introduce  that  to  youngsters
at an early age, kids are fascinated by this stuff, but they want to
see, so what.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Right, they want the end result.
Mr. KVAMME. What do we got to do? So what?
Mr. MURDOCK. If I could build on that for a second, the question
was  asked  earlier  about  business’s  role  in  educating  the  general
public,  and  I  think  we  are  just  starting  to  move  into  the  second
wave  of  nanotechnology  commercialization  where  you’re  really  see-
ing some of these, you know, very exciting, transformational appli-
cations like solar energy. There is a portfolio of companies that are
really  changing  the  cost  structure  of  solar  energy  so  that  we  are
going  to  see,  you  know,  meaningful  new  penetration  of  that  tech-
nology.  Obviously,  the  60  Minutes  episode  was  just  referenced  in
terms of addressing cancer. And so as more and more of these com-
pelling  applications  come  to  market,  I  think  it  will  inspire.  There
is an old saying, success is one percent inspiration, 99 percent per-
spiration.  Having  said  that,  if  you  don’t  have  the  inspiration  first,
you  don’t  undertake  the  perspiration  to  follow.  And  so  I  think  we
will see more of that.

The  other  thing  that  we  have  said  in  our  previous  testimony  on
this  issue  is  that  we  think  it’s  important  that  people  also  think
about  education  from  the  student’s  view,  and  not  just  the  teacher.
We  absolutely  agree  with  all  of  the  investments  that  need  to  be
made, right, in terms of teacher capability standards and all of that
but  to  also  adopt  a  student-centric  view  of  the  world,  engage  in
more  self-directed  learning  and  inquiry-driven  learning  that  is  ap-
plied and helps people relate as they are educated to adult benefits
in the applications associated with it.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Murdock,  and  thank  you,

Ms. Woolsey and we are glad that you are our example.

Ms. WOOLSEY. You like my back. Yeah, I am a good example.
Chairman  GORDON.  And  now  the  temporary  but  not  ostracized
Ranking Member, Mr. Rohrabacher, is recognized for five minutes.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have
a  little  cold  today.  By  the  way,  in  the  future,  do  you  think
nanotechnology is going to help me with my cold? Is that possible?
Eating up those little bacterias or whatever that I caught from my
children?

Let  me  say  something,  and  you  tell  me  if  there  is  anybody  who
disagrees with this. From what I am hearing today, that everybody
on the panel believes that nanotechnology has such a great, signifi-
cant promise for our society, that it should be a priority for the gov-
ernment  and  society  to  work  to  develop  it  and  to  prepare  for  it.
Would  you  all  agree  with  that,  it  should  be  a  priority  for  us?  Let
me  tell  you,  the  biggest  impediment  that  I  have  seen  to  progress
is  that  people  who  believe  things  that  should  be  a  priority  for  our
society are unwilling to prioritize, and I will tell you that we don’t
need  people  to  come  here  and  tell  us  simply  to  spend  more  money

on  something.  Everybody  will  tell  us  to  spend  more  money  on
something.  What  I  need  from  you  gentleman  is  for  you  to  tell  me
exactly  how  important  it  is  compared  to  something  else  that  you
would  like  us  to  get  the  funding  from,  because  I  am  open  to  that
idea.  For  example,  fusion  was  a  great  dream.  I  mean,  ever  since
I  was  a  kid,  I  saw  little  films  on  fusion  was  going  to  come  along.
We  spent  billions  of  dollars  on  fusion  research,  and  it  continues
today. I have asked people, you know, what is the potential of that,
and they say, we will know if you just spend another billion dollars
we  will  know  what  the  potential  is.  Well,  you  guys  seem  to  know
what the potential of nanotechnology is. Do you think we should—
is it fusion or somewhere else you can point to where we are spend-
ing a lot of money in research that this should have a priority over?
Anybody on the panel is fine.

Dr. KRAJCIK. You know what? I will say that for every penny we
spend  on  nanotechnology,  we  also  have  to  spend  money  on  edu-
cation and the reason why——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. All right. Let me get to that.
Dr. KRAJCIK.—is that we cannot raise a public——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Let  me  get  to  that.  I  want  a  priority  here.  I
want where you are going to tell me where not to. I don’t want you
to go on another education speech.

Dr. KRAJCIK. I am not going to go on an education speech.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Where  is  something  that  you  want  to  de-
fund?  Nothing.  Now,  let  me  tell  you  something.  You  can  come  be-
fore this panel——

Mr. KVAMME. I would be happy to give you a suggestion.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. So what is it? What have you got for me?
Dr. KRAJCIK. Fusion. You can de-fund fusion.
Mr.  KVAMME.  By  one  count  that  we  did,  I  think  there  are  220
different federal programs of some $10 million apiece for tech edu-
cation  K–12.  There  is  no  way  that  is  an  efficient  spending  of
money.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. There is no way what, now?
Mr.  KVAMME.  There  is  no  way  that  is  efficient  spending.  You
can’t  have  210  or  220  programs  and  be  efficient.  I  would  look  at
those and try to figure out a way how to spend half the money but
do it more efficiently.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. So you don’t want to de-fund, you want

us to make it more efficient. Isn’t there anybody that ever——

Mr. KVAMME. I will cut it in half.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  can  someone  come  here  and  tell  me
what  area  of  research  is  now  wasted  as  compared  to  the  money
that  you  want  to  spend  on  this?  No?  Okay.  Well,  let  me  tell  you
something.  People  in  the  scientific  community  should  not  come  to
Congress  and  tell  us  that  they  are  willing  to  say  how  important
something  is  unless  they  are  willing  to  compare  it  to  what  some-
thing  is  less  important  because  that  doesn’t  mean  anything.  We
have a limited budget. We want to do what is right by that budget.
I  personally  would  think  that  nanotechnology  should  receive  a
large  portion  of  the  money  that  we  should  spend  or  that  we  will
save  by  eliminating  fusion  energy  research  because  it  hasn’t
panned out.

Back to education, to my friend who was about to talk about edu-
cation,  one  of  the  problems  that  we  have  found  on  this  committee
is  that  sociology  teachers  and  history  teachers  and  English  lit-
erature teachers and physical education teachers and basket weav-
ing  teachers  in  high  school  are  demanding  that  they  receive  the
same  pay  level  as  mathematics  teachers  and  science  teachers.  Do
you  support  a  differential  in  pay  that  would  permit  schools  to  pay
more money in education to mathematics and science teachers?

Dr.  KRAJCIK.  I  think  we  have  to  have  high  quality  math  and

science teachers.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  But  you  are  not  willing  to  say  spend  more?
There  is  the  other  thing.  There  are  these  heavy  interest  groups  in
our  society.  We  know  the  teachers  unions  are  not  going  to  support
somebody else getting more money because it happens to be impor-
tant for our society.

Dr.  KRAJCIK.  Well,  if  it  takes  getting  good  science  teachers,  and
we need good science teachers, if it takes paying them more money,
then we should pay them more money.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Pay  them  more  money  than  the  other  teach-

ers?

onto science teaching?

Dr.  KRAJCIK.  The  way  we  can  attract  our  best  graduates  to  go

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yeah.
Dr. KRAJCIK. Then I would say let us give them more money.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  It  is  the  only  way  we  are  going  to  do  it  and

it is——

Dr. KRAJCIK. If that is the case, then I think we should do it be-
cause  we  have  a  lot  of  really  smart  people,  and  we  really  need
them in education.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And we can sing their accolades all day long,
but  the  bottom  line  is  we  want  more  young  people  to  get  involved,
we  want  higher  quality  math  and  science  teachers,  we  have  got  to
pay them more money, and we have got to pay more money to our
engineers  and  our  scientists,  rather  than  having  them  tied  to  soci-
ologists and political scientists, whatever that word is.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  and  we  hope
you  feel  better.  Now,  Mr.  Honda,  we  are  glad  that  you  joined  us
today, and you are recognized.

Mr.  HONDA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  think  I  share  Mr.
Rohrabacher’s  frustration  about  the  constant  barrage  of  criticism
about  we  need  to  do  more  in  education.  I  don’t  think  that  comes
when  Woolsey’s  question  was  answered.  She  asked  what  is  it  that
you  have  done,  rather  than  telling  us  what  you  think  are  some  of
the  factors.  And  I  am  sure  that  Dr.  Krajcik  is  a  professor  of  edu-
cation  and  he  has  spoken  about  the  kinds  of  things  that  need  to
be done in the area of teacher preparation and curricula and those
kinds  of  things.  And  if  you  are  suggesting  there  are  over  200  pro-
grams  that  could  be  cut  that  is  in  education,  I  would  like  to  know
how diverse those programs are before they are consolidated or cut
because  the  last  eight  years,  my  friend,  you  know  that  education
and  everything  else  has  been  cut,  including  ATP  and  other  things
that require innovated people to be funded to—along.

So  I  think  the  idea  of  participating  and  following  through  with
some  of  the  ideas  you  do  have  about  how  to  improve  education

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 10:09 Sep 22, 2008 Jkt 041672 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL08\041608\41672 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

would  be  of  great  help,  but  being  a  teacher  myself,  I  want  to  take
this moment, Mr. Chairman, if I could and I will just tell you that
all  those  programs  and  all  the  subject  matters  are  important  for
the  development  of  a  good  citizen  and  for  development  of  a  society
that  can  reach  its  highest  point.  Music,  performing  arts,  they  are
all  embedded  with  science,  and  like  nano,  you  know,  once  we  un-
derstand  nano,  we  understand  that  everything  that  functions  in
this  world  is  at  a  nanoscale,  it  is  just  that  we  are  just  getting
there.  You  can’t  take  nano  away  from  technology  and  expect  that
things  are  going  to  be  the  same.  We  suspect  that  with  nano,  you
know, messing around in that whole area, would push Moore’s Law
another 150 years old and probably more.

And  so  I  don’t  disagree  that  we  should  be  putting  money  into
basic  research.  I  don’t  disagree  that  we  should  be  putting  money
from the feds to partner with industry and—research to get beyond
the  gap  or  the  value  of  this  so  they  can  get  to  commercialization.
But  I  think  that  terminology  or  rhetoric  that  is  so  broad  without
detail  rings  hollow  to  me,  and  I  appreciate  this  dialogue.  I  think
the dialogue is needed to be said, and when we concern about our-
selves  with  other  countries  and  say  they  are  doing  better  than  we
are,  I  think  we  better  be  prepared  to  have  the  details  there  be-
cause,  you  know,  when  people  say  China  has  300,000  engineers,
you  better  be  prepared  to  say,  of  those  how  many  are  the  kinds  of
engineers  and  technologists  that  we  have  that  think  new  things
rather  than—be  it  civil  engineers  or  other  kinds  of  engineers  that
they need for their own development of their infrastructure in their
own country.

So I think that if you can be precise, then our terminology needs
to  be  precise,  so  we  can  solve  the  kinds  of  problems  we  face  as  a
country  together  and  then  move  forward  without  the  fear  of  fear
and  invest  in  our  own  children  in  the  proper  way.  And  that  chal-
lenge will have to go right down to how we plan our cities, how we
look at the issue of equity because the way we do things with edu-
cation  is  not  equity,  it  is  parity.  Unless  we  are  willing  to  change
our  whole  assessment  of  what  a  neighborhood  is,  what  a  school  is,
and  how  we  fund  our  children,  then  we  are  not  prepared  to  move
forward  in  education.  And  just  like  nanotechnology,  it  is  an  eye-
opener. Things change when we get to that point. And I appreciate
your work, all of your work, in the area of nano because I will have
a better fishing pole as a result.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me wax on.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Honda.
Mr. MURDOCK. If I could make just one quick comment? In terms
of  what  we  are  doing,  the  nanotech  companies  are  relatively  small
in  the  grand  scheme  of  things,  but  we  are  starting  the  process  of
addressing  this  education.  Several  member  companies  that  are  in
the  instrumentation  business  have  done  R&D  to  create  lower  cost
machinery  so  that  we  can  get  something  that  is  viable  to  get  into
the community colleges and the classrooms so that people can have
those  hands-on  learning  experiences,  one.  Two,  the  Alliance  itself
is  working  with  companies  to  try  to  set  up  an  internship  program
in  some  of  these  pioneering  nanotech  companies  so  that  folks  can
experience firsthand some of the transformational work that is tak-
ing  place  to  lead  that  inspiration.  It  is  not  going  to  solve  things,

84

and it is not going to do it overnight by any stretch of the imagina-
tion, but it is a start and you got to start somewhere.

Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Honda,  let  me  just—I  shouldn’t  have  to
remind everyone but I will once again that last year this committee
passed  out  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  the  President  signed  last  August
the  America  COMPETES  Act.  The  America  COMPETES  Act  does
a variety of things. It doubles our investment over a seven-year pe-
riod  in  the  National  Science  Foundation,  in  NIST,  in  the  Office  of
Science within the Department of Energy. It also goes to the issue
of  our  students  in  the  math  and  science  area,  recognizing  that  it
all  starts  with  the  teacher  and  that  we  certainly  are  as  bright  as
any  other  country  around,  but  you  have  to  have  teachers  that  not
only know how to teach but also have a core knowledge within that
subject area.

Just  very  quickly,  one  of  the  things  we  discovered  was  that  63
percent of the middle school math teachers had neither a major nor
a  certification  to  teach  math.  Ninety-three  percent  of  the  physical
science teachers had neither a major nor certification. So no matter
how  good  you  might  be  in  terms  of  your  ability,  you  have  to  have
a  core  knowledge;  and  that  is  why  within  the  National  Science
Foundation,  there  is  a  program  called  the  Noyce  Scholarship  Pro-
gram  that  we  scaled  out  that  will  provide  scholarships  for  those
students  that  want  to  go  into  math  or  science  and  education  and
agree  to  teach  for  five  years.  It  will  also  bring  back  those  good
teachers  that  need  more  course  work,  a  stipend  for  them  to  come
in the summer. They will then be able to get their AP course, their
master’s, certification, whatever it might be. There will be scholar-
ships  for  those  folks  that  want  to  go  into  pure  research.  We  really
don’t  have  to  argue  about  this  much  longer.  I  mean,  we  have  a
plan.  When  Norm  Augustine  brought  in  his  group  that  reported
back  on  the  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  I  told  him  that
they  didn’t  bring  us  anything  we  didn’t  know.  They  just  put  it  in
a good package. We said we don’t need to study it anymore, we just
need  to  do  it  and  that  means  funding  it.  And  I  have  a  letter  here
that I think it was 225 of the major industries have signed recom-
mending  that,  as  I  say,  Mr.  Ehlers  in  a  bipartisan  effort  and  Ms.
Biggert, who is not here now, are trying to do.

So hopefully we are going to be able to see that funding and from
that  we  are  going  to  see  the  realization  of  what  we  have  all  been
talking about. Mr. Lipinski, a beneficiary of that math and science
education  is  here  and,  before  we  hear  the  bells  ring,  is  recognized.
Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have  stated  many
times  before,  I  have  drunk  the  Kool  Aid  on  nanotechnology,  but  I
don’t  want  anyone  to  think  that  because  I  walked  in  here  with  a
camera  I  was  that  excited  in  coming  to  take  your  pictures  here.  I
just  came  from  the  White  House  with  seeing  the  Pope  there,  so  I
just  wanted  to  make  sure  I  got  back  here  as  soon  as  I  could  be-
cause  I  wanted  to—I  know  how  important  this  is.  I  believe  it  is
critical that we really do have an investment on behalf of the Fed-
eral  Government  in  nanotechnology.  It  is  really  critical  for  our  fu-
ture.

In  one  area  that  I  wanted  to  ask  about,  let  me  throw  this  out
to  whomever  wants  to  pick  up  on  this,  I  want  to  ask  about
nanoelectronics. It is certainly an important field, and I am just cu-

rious  to  hear  a 
in
nanoelectronics,  what  research  is  being  conducted,  what  are  really
the key things that the research is focusing on right now.

little  more  about  what 

is  going  on 

Dr.  DOERING.  I  guess  I  will  take  that  one.  Nanoelectronics  re-
search right now is really focused on how do we replace this incum-
bent technology that we call CMOS for short. It is just an acronym.
I won’t go into the details. But it is a technology that we have used
for over 30 years now. It is the workhorse of all electronics, big and
small, that you see throughout the world today, and we have been
miniaturizing  it,  or  scaling  it  we  like  to  say  in  the  industry,  for
these  30  years  and  it  is  reaching  some  pretty  fundamental  limits
in  terms  of  what  it  costs  per  function,  to  try  to  make  it  smaller,
what its energy efficiency is, what its speed can be, how much den-
sity of storage of information you can get with it. And so the really
big,  grand  challenge  that  the  industry  is  looking  at  right  now  in
nanoelectronics  is  how  can  we  find  a  new  component,  basically  a
new  transistor  which  is  the  guts  of  CMOS  that  can  take  us  to  the
next level in cost and energy efficiency and just pure performance.
And so this is basically the challenge that nanoelectronics research
initiative has taken up partnering so far within NSF and NIST and
the  Federal  Government  and  with  a  number  of  states  across  the
country,  and  we  are  hoping  that  before  we  have  a  situation  where
CMOS  completely  runs  out  of  gas  that  we  definitely  have  a  new
switch that can replace today’s transistor.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Anyone else?
Mr.  KVAMME.  May  I  could  comment.  You  specifically  said  elec-
tronics, but as you probably know, there are an awful lot of things
going  on  in  photonics  where  photons  are  replacing  electrons  to  do
certain  functions,  particularly  in  the  communications  sector.  And
today, you know, we are able now to put 80 simultaneous TV chan-
nels under a single fiber. That is largely due to what is happening
from  the  standpoint  of  the  constant  miniaturization  of  what  is
going on in the photonics world as well, so that is another example.
Sean mentioned, and I am familiar with a company that is using
nanomaterials from the standpoint of depositing solar cells, so they
lower the cost dramatically. Again, not electronics, that is material
science,  but  it  is  still  nano  and  it  is  going  to  affect  electronics,  be-
cause  it  creates  electrons  in  that  particular  case.  So  there  are  two
other examples, photonics and energy——

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Well,  I  am  going  to  jump  in  there.  You  mentioned
about  solar.  What  else  is  going  on  in  terms  of  nano  research  and
development  in  regard  to  energy?  What  kind  of  projects  are  going
on right now?

Mr.  MURDOCK.  I  think  there  is  tremendous  activity  and  yet  op-
portunity  for  more  with  respect  to  nanotechnology  and  energy.  I
think  there  is  clear  recognition  now  of  the  immense  potential  im-
pact  of  using  nanomaterials  for  solar  energy  to  absorb  more  of  the
energy  spectrum  and  to  use  different  processes.  The  way  we  make
most conventional solar cells right now is a lot like the way a Pen-
tium chip is made, you know, polycrystalline silicon and an expen-
sive  fab,  et  cetera.  The  new  approaches  are  using  nanomaterials
and  doing  them  in  more  roll-to-roll  processes  which  is  more  analo-
gous  to  the  way  a  newspaper  is  printed.  So  that  is  one  big  area.
Another  is  in  battery  technologies.  There  is  a  lot  of  work  with  im-

proving  lithium  batteries,  charge  rates,  and  that  but  not  just  that.
Fireflights,  an  Illinois  company,  has  figured  out  how  to  essentially
get  the  lead  out  of  lead  acid  batteries  and  give  new  life  to  that
technology which then becomes an important part of an integrated
solar  energy  system.  Fuel  cells,  I  think  if  you  look  down  almost
every  aspect  of  energy,  the  frontier  of  what  is  being  explored,
nanoscience  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  those
technologies.

learn 

Ms. RICHARDSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually I am kind
of proud to be here because I am from the home state of California,
and in California, the California Nanosystems Institute was found-
ed  back  in  2002;  and  two  UC  campuses  who  have  been  very  en-
gaged  in  that  process  was  both  UCLA  and  UC–Santa  Barbara
which  I  attended  both  of  them.  So  this  subject  matter  is  of  great
interest to me as well.

I  just  wanted  to  ask  one  quick  question,  and  I  think  it  is  to  Dr.
Maynard’s  office  and  some  of  the  work  that  you  have  done.  What
can  we

nanotechnology risk research?

the  European  Union’s  approach 

investing  a 

lot  of  research  across  the  board 

Dr. MAYNARD. I don’t think anybody has really got this fixed yet,
but  if  you  look  at  what  Europe  is  doing,  they  are  taking  a  formal
strategic  and  systematic  approach  to  risk-based  research.  So  they
are  currently  in  their  seventh  framework  research  program  where
they  are 
in
nanotechnology.  But  they  have  specifically  focused  a  number  of
very  targeted  research  programs  asking  very  specific  questions,
like  what  is  the  toxicity  of  certain  nanomaterials,  how  do  you
measure  exposure  to  nanomaterials,  and  half-a-dozen  other
projects.  What  they  are  doing  is  they  are  starting  out  by  asking
what  do  we  need  to  know  if  we  are  going  to  make  this  technology
succeed, and then they are asking groups of researchers to address
those  very  specific  questions.  And  they  are  putting  a  lot  of  money
into it as well. But they are also doing something else which really
isn’t  occurring  in  the  States,  and  that  is  they  are  partnering  be-
tween  government  and  industry.  And  so  every  European  research
project  that  comes  out  also  has  its  industrial  partners,  and  that
means not only are you leveraging money from within government
and  industry  but  you  are  also  using  the  expertise  that  you  have
within  those  industrial  partners  who  are  developing  the  applica-
tions  and  the  technologies  which  we  hopefully  are  going  to  see
being used. So that is a big difference there. And of course, I show
even back as far as 2006, if you look at research which is primarily
focused  on  understanding  risks  of  these  very,  very  specific  ques-
tions, they are actually investing or were investing more in Europe
than we were in the United States.

Ms. RICHARDSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Richardson.  And  before  we
close,  let  me  also  give  my  thanks  to  Ranking  Member  Hall  for
being a part of the bipartisan group that is signing the letter to the
appropriators  and  the  President  asking  for  additional  funding  and

though  this  is  a  work  in  process,  that  we  have  a  good  draft  here.
We welcome the good advice we have, we want to get additional ad-

gether on this very important subject. And so I thank our witnesses
for  being  a  part  of  that  today.  We  will  leave  the  record  open  for
additional  Members  that  have  questions,  and  with  that,  the  wit-
nesses are excused and the meeting is adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by E. Floyd Kvamme, Co-Chair, President’s Council of Advisors on Science

and Technology

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Is the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) satis-
fied  that  the  NNI  is  adequately  coordinating  environmental,  health  and  safety
research  internationally  so  as  to  avoid  unnecessary  overlap  and  to  gain  max-
imum benefit from the overall international research investment?

A1. Yes.  As  noted  in  PCAST’s  second  review  of  the  NNI: 
‘‘The  [National
Nanotechnology  Advisory  Panel]  NNAP  has  paid  particular  attention  to  EHS  fund-
ing and current research efforts in this review. The panel finds that from a scientific
point of view, while there is still plenty to learn, the research being funded is lead-
ing  to  an  ever-increasing  body  of  knowledge  about  EHS  issues.  Budgetary  support
for EHS has been growing at a rate well above that of the entire NNI program and,
as such, the panel believes it is of the right order of magnitude to continue building
knowledge of EHS issues as knowledge of the science increases. The panel does note
that  if  expenditures  of  other  countries  in  the  global  economy  were  as  significant  in
the EHS field as those in the United States, and with ongoing, appropriately multi-
national communication efforts, the entire field would benefit greatly.’’ 1

The  NNI  maintains  a  leading  role  in  coordinating  EHS  activities  internationally,
particularly  within  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development
(OECD)  and  the  International  Standardization  Organization  (ISO).  The  U.S.  (EPA)
chairs  the  OECD  Working  Party  on  Manufactured  Nanomaterials  (WPMN),  which
is the body that is leading efforts to share EHS information and coordinate the col-
laborative development of information that is needed by governments and industries
worldwide. The WPMN also interfaces with the broader strategic policy coordination
under the Working Party on Nanotechnology, which is also chaired by the U.S. (De-
partment  of  State).  Also,  Clayton  Teague,  director  of  the  National  Nanotechnology
Coordinating  Office  (NNCO),  chairs  the  U.S.  ANSI-accredited  Technical  Advisory
Group  and  heads  the  U.S.  delegation  to  the  ISO  technical  committee  on
nanotechnologies,  which  is  working  to  develop  standards  for  instrumentation,  ref-
erence materials, test methods, and EHS practices. ISO standards often are adopted
widely.  PCAST  endorses  the  NNI’s  continued  participation  and  leadership  in  these
activities, which it called for in its first report as the National Nanotechnology Advi-
sory Panel (NNAP).
Q2. The  NNTI  Advisory  Panel  in  its  recent  assessment  of  the  program  encourages

investment in infrastructure and instrumentation under the NNI.
• Does the Advisory Panel believe the current allocation of resources is adequate
to  maintain  the  existing  facilities  and  provide  for  upgrades  as  needed  to  keep
them at the leading edge of technology?
• Did the Advisory Panel assess whether the capabilities of the current facilities
are  meeting  the  needs  of  the  research  community  in  terms  of  accessibility  and
capabilities of the available instrumentation and equipment?

A2. The  NNAP  assessment  of  the  NNI  is  conducted  at  a  high-level  in  terms  of  the
performance  of  the  NNI  program  as  a  whole.  The  panel  believes  that  resource  allo-
cation  for  facility  maintenance  and  accessibility  is  generally  adequate  and  appro-
priate and needs to be sustained. As noted in the report, the infrastructure and in-
strumentation  developed  through  the  NNI  is  a  preeminent  feature  of  U.S.  leader-
ship  in  nanotechnology  and  constitutes  a  lasting  legacy  of  the  initiative.  As  instru-
mentation and methodologies for nanotechnology research continue to be developed,
this structure of centers, networks, and user facilities serves to incorporate the state
of the science and make it available to the maximum number of researchers in aca-
demia and industry, primarily for pre-competitive, non-proprietary research but also
with an eye towards technology transfer and commercialization, as appropriate. For
example,  in  the  DOE  Nanoscale  Science  Research  Centers,  user  access  is  allocated
via  merit-based  peer  review  of  proposals  from  qualified  researchers.  Use  of  the  fa-
cilities  and  staff  assistance  are  provided  to  users  free  of  charge,  provided  that  the
results of the research are published in the open literature. Proprietary research of
merit  can  also  be  conducted  at  an  NSRC  on  a  full  cost  recovery  basis.  Beyond  the
user  facilities,  most  NNI-funded  research  centers  are  open  to  collaboration  with  in-

dustry, and in some cases industry participation is a requirement for successful pro-
posals (for example, NSF and NCI centers).

To  date  much  of  the  investment  of  the  NNI  has  been  to  build  and  resource  the
research  facilities  that  now  make  up  the  81  centers,  networks,  and  user  facilities
that constitute the backbone of the NNI. In the coming years, NNI funding will shift
from  building  to  maintenance  and  increased  support  of  the  research  these  facilities
were  designed  to  carry  out.  Current  budget  levels  should  be  adequate  to  support
this next phase of the program.

the 

A1. The recent PCAST report on the NNI lists examples and case studies in a vari-
ety of areas of the progress towards real-world applications resulting from the NNI.
But  the  overarching  success  of  the  NNI  has  been  the  leadership  and  competitive
edge  that  it  has  afforded  the  U.S.  in  the  development  and  expansion  of  this  novel
area  of  technology  development.  Given  the  fact  that  spending  in  nanotechnology  in
Europe and Asia are approximately the same as U.S. spending, it is a credit to the
leader  across  the  many  areas
NNI  that  America 
nanotechnology 
that
nanotechnology  development  holds  for  nearly  every  industry,  the  additional  atten-
tion  and  support  that  the  NNI  has  brought  to  bear  has  been  and  remains  critical
for  the  U.S.  to  lead  the  world  in  capitalizing  on  the  economic  and  societal  benefits.
I believe the draft reauthorization presents an opportunity to support the NNI by
maintaining  the  high-profile  of  nanotechnology  and  stressing  the  importance  of  on-
going interagency, cross-sector and international coordination. However, the current
draft  does  appear  to  add  unnecessary  administrative  burdens  tending  towards
micro-management  and  that  could  have  the  unintended  effect  of  inhibiting  rather
than strengthening coordination among the agencies. While there have been no sys-
temic  failures  in  the  NNI  to  date,  I  am  concerned  that  the  onerous  reporting  re-
quirements for example with nanomanufacturing and nanotechnology EHS research
projects  will  be  counterproductive  and  could  lead  to  less  effective  collaboration.  No
other area of federal R&D receives such detailed scrutiny as is being proposed, and
frankly  the  benefit  of  such  granularity  versus  the  cost  is  not  clear  to  me.  Funding
that would be necessary to carry out these reporting functions could better be spent
increasing  public  communication  and  education  about  nanotechnology  as  proposed
in our report.
Q2. How  would  you  address  the  concerns  of  those  who  might  perceive  Congress  as
picking  winners  and  losers  by  specifically  naming  areas  of  national  importance
in the legislation?

A2. I  don’t  feel  this  is  a  necessary  addition  to  the  legislation.  The  NNI  previously
organized its investments around ‘‘grand challenges’’ that included some of the pro-
posed  areas  of  ‘‘national  importance.’’  Programmatically,  however,  the  organization
of the NNI around Program Component Areas has been far more effective for man-
aging  and  coordinating  the  program.  Calling  out  particular  areas  of  focus  as  ‘‘win-
ners’’ by definition lowers the priority of other areas of equal (if perhaps less urgent)
importance,  such  as  fundamental  basic  research,  which  is  absolutely  critical  to  the
ongoing  success  of  our  system  of  innovation.  Furthermore  adding  such  crosscuts
over  and  above  the  PCAs  may  compromise  the  purpose  of  that  structure  for  man-
aging and coordinating the NNI.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. As  we  know,  many  companies  who  have  taken  advantage  of  the  benefits  of
nanotechnology  choose  not  to  advertise  this  fact  in  their  products,  for  fear  of
public backlash. I understand their concerns, as I do not believe the general pub-
lic has a solid understanding of nanotechnology. Does the legislation do enough
to enhance public awareness and education in the held of nanotechnology? Is ad-
ditional  international  cooperation  needed  to  assist  the  United  States  in  edu-
cating  our  citizens?  Can  you  give  us  some  examples  of  what  other  countries  are
doing to inform and educate their people?

A1. Yes.  Strengthening  our  public  outreach  and  communication  efforts  is  essential
to  avoid  the  drawbacks  of  hyping  both  anticipated  benefits  and  feared  risks  by

92

grounding  the  public  dialogue  in  actual  science  and  fact.  As  noted  in  our  report,
PCAST remains concerned that the economic and societal benefits of nanotechnology
are being overlooked or minimized by the emphasis on uncertainties and speculation
that is unconstrained by actual, realistic exposure and hazard assessment.

I’m  not  positioned  to  speak  in  anything  other  than  broad  terms  with  respect  to
the  outreach  and  public  engagement  efforts  of  other  countries  on  nanotechnology,
but  it  certainly  will  serve  our  efforts  for  the  NNI  to  continue  engaging  with  other
countries,  as  it  has  with  the  Working  Party  on  Nanotechnology  of  the  OECD,  in
international  workshops  and  programs  aimed  at  improving  communication  and
broad stakeholder engagement by exchanging best practices and evaluating various
policies in societal context.
Q2. Nanoelectronics  is  an  area  within  the  field  of  nanotechnology  that  is  certainly
important, and I am curious to hear a little more about its current status. Could
you give me a better sense of the work being conducted in this specific area, and
what  has  resulted  thus  far  from  this  research?  Approximately  how  much  fund-
ing  is  currently  devoted  to  nanoelectronics?  And  is  this  funding  adequate  for
what  is  needed  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  nanoelectronics  and  the  work  needed
to smooth the transfer of the research into commercial products?

A2. The  industrial  sector  has  historically  taken  the  lead  in  collaborative,  pre-com-
petitive  work  on  developing  the  fundamental  technologies  that  are  fundamental  to
electronics,  including  circuit  component  and  chip  design  that  looks  beyond  the  cur-
rent state-of-the-art. NNI continues to facilitate this work through its industrial liai-
son  working  group  which  is  working  with  the  semiconductor  industry  and  through
funding  of  collaborative,  cross-sector  programs  like  the  model  Nanoelectronics  Re-
search Initiative (NRI; nri.src.org). NSF and NIST have formed public-private part-
nerships with the NRI to support ground-breaking nanoelectronics R&D. Both agen-
cies and the industry members of the NRI each provide funding to support research
towards that target, conducted through university-based centers.

The NNI tracks annual funding by Program Component Area rather than applica-
tion area, but a rough estimate by the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office
of funding for nanoelectronics (including nanomagnetics and nanophotonics for proc-
essing,  storage,  and/or  communications  devices,  which  are  difficult  to  separate  out)
across  the  NNI  is  approximately  $100  million.  PCAST  did  not  formally  assess  the
adequacy of funding for particular application areas within the NNI, but its broader
assessment of technology transfer and commercialization through the NNI was posi-
tive,  noting  that  the  NNI  plays  a  key  role  in  surmounting  the  barriers  to
nanotechnology innovation and commercial application by supporting both basic and
targeted  research,  developing  and  maintaining  critical  infrastructure,  and  training
researchers with interdisciplinary capabilities to capture the revolutionary potential
of nanotechnology.

Responses by Sean Murdock, Executive Director, NanoBusiness Alliance

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Is  there  a  need  to  expand  the  availability  of  nanotechnology  user  facilities  that
would be relevant to industry’s needs? If so, would the NSF Industry-University
Research  Centers  model  be  a  viable  mechanism  for  expanding  the  number  and
diversity of nanotechnology user facilities? Under such a model, federal funding
would  support  the  initial  start-up  costs,  administration,  and  staffing  needs  of
the user facility, while industry would provide the bulk of funding through user
fees for use of the facilities.

A1. There is a need to expand the availability of nanotechnology user facilities that
are relevant to industry’s needs, and the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amend-
ments  Act  of  2008  will  help  address  that  need.  The  NSF  Industry-University  Re-
search  Centers  model  is  a  viable  mechanism,  provided  that  nanotechnology  compa-
nies  are  made  aware  of  its  availability  and  that  administrative  requirements  (and
IP policies) are not onerous for companies seeking to participate. Furthermore, it is
critical that the user fees are based upon the marginal cost of provisioning services
(plus  a  markup)  so  that  general  university  (as  opposed  to  true  facility)  overheads
are  not  built  into  the  user  fees.  Otherwise,  overhead  costs  often  become  significant
and create a disincentive for industry use.
Q2. To  what  extent  are  nanotechnology  businesses  engaged  in  educational  outreach
activities with high school students or post-secondary students? Do your compa-
nies sponsor activities at informal science institutions?

A2. Nanotechnology  businesses  are  in  many  cases  engaged  in  educational  outreach
activities  with  high  school  and  post-secondary  students.  Although  most
nanotechnology  businesses  are  small  businesses  that  lack  the  resources  to  support
substantial programs, a number of companies have established internships for high
school  or  college  students.  The  NanoBusiness  Alliance  itself  has  an  internship  pro-
gram that places talented students with leading nanotechnology companies. In addi-
tion, nanotechnology tools manufacturers are designing relatively inexpensive, user-
friendly tools for classroom use.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What are the successes of the NNI over the past five years? Does the draft before
us preserve the elements that led to these successes? What parts of the NNI have
failed? Are there elements the Committee should consider terminating?

A1. The NNI has been extraordinarily successful over the past five years in accom-
plishing its central task of coordinating and accelerating federal nanotechnology re-
search  and  development.  The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act
of  2008  preserves  the  elements  of  the  NNI’s  structure  that  led  to  those  successes.
The NNI has been less successful at the admittedly difficult task of setting and en-
vironmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  research  agenda,  and  the  bill  takes  steps  to
address that issue. The Alliance does not recommend terminating any portion of the
NNI at this point.
Q2. How  would  you  address  the  concerns  of  those  who  might  perceive  Congress  as
picking  winners  and  losers  by  specifically  naming  areas  of  national  importance
in the legislation?

A2. The Alliance believes it is important that the Federal Government not pick win-
ners and losers in the marketplace. Foreign countries are focusing their investments
and supporting companies directly to help establish nanotechnology and to compete
with  the  United  States.  The  Alliance  argued  for  the  inclusion  of  support  for
translational  nanotechnology  research  in  areas  on  national  importance  to  level  the
playing field, but has recommended keeping these areas broad so as to avoid picking
winners and losers. Furthermore, funding in these areas of national importance will
take place on a competitive basis, so the actual winners and losers will depend upon
market competitiveness.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. Sean, you mentioned in your testimony that we should focus our efforts on goal-
oriented  research  in  areas  of  national  importance.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  Na-
tion’s  Centers  on  Nanotechnology  are  critical  to  solving  the  grand  challenges  of
our  time,  such  as  those  we  face  on  the  environment  and  energy.  Can  you  give
us some examples of the products that have resulted from the research being con-
ducted  at  these  Centers?  And  in  what  other  areas  do  you  suggest  we  focus  our
efforts?

A1. There  are  important  products  beginning  to  emerge  from  these  centers.  A  case
study  that  may  be  of  particular  interest  to  Congressman  Lipinski  because  of  its
proximity  to  his  district  is  Northwestern  University’s  Nanoscale  Science  and  Engi-
neering  Center  (NSEC).  Nanosphere,  which  is  based  in  Northbrook,  Illinois  has  re-
cently  received  approval  for  a  molecular  diagnostic  test  for  susceptibility  to  war-
farin, a blood thinner used for stroke victims in emergency room situations. Because
the  test  will  provide  information  on  genetic  susceptibility  in  real  time,  it  will  save
lives.  NanoInk  is  commercializing  NanoEncryptionΤΜ Technology  based  upon  dip
pen  nanolithography  developed  by  Chad  Mirkin  at  Northwestern.  The  technology
makes  it  possible  to  secure  the  Nation’s  pharmaceutical  drug  supply  by  encoding  a
nanoscale mark on each pill that is manufactured, which technology will protect pa-
tient  safety  and  reduce  the  opportunity  for  criminals  and  terrorists  to  sell  counter-
feit pharmaceuticals. Many more products are on the way from Northwestern’s cen-
ter  and  others  throughout  the  Nation.  We  are  just  beginning  to  see  the  return  on
our nation’s investment in nanoscience centers of excellence.

The  Alliance  supports  the  areas  of  national  importance  listed  in  the  bill.  In  gen-
eral,  we  believe  that  the  United  States  has  comparative  advantages  in  most  of  the
areas that make nanotechnology a benefit from an EHS perspective: cleaner energy,
better  health  care,  improved  water  and  air  quality,  and  so  on—as  well  as
nanoelectronics.
Q2. As  we  know,  many  companies  who  have  taken  advantage  of  the  benefits  of
nanotechnology  choose  not  to  advertise  this  fact  in  their  products,  for  fear  of
public backlash. I understand their concerns, as I do not believe the general pub-
lic has a solid understanding of nanotechnology. Does the legislation do enough
to  enhance  public  awareness  and  education  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology?  Is
additional  international  cooperation  needed  to  assist  the  United  States  in  edu-
cating  our  citizens?  Can  you  give  us  some  examples  of  what  other  countries  are
doing to inform and educate their people?

A2. The general public still does not have a solid understanding of nanotechnology,
despite the best efforts of the Alliance, its members, and countless educational insti-
tutions throughout the country. The bill takes some steps to help address this situa-
tion,  which  is  important  because  the  public’s  lack  of  a  clear  understanding  of
nanotechnology is one of the greatest risks that the nanobusiness community faces.
International cooperation is critically important, especially in the area of standards
development—but  when  it  comes  to  educating  the  public,  I  believe  that  we  need  to
be  educating  Europe  rather  than  asking  for  their  help  to  educate  us.  It  seems  that
not a month goes by without an over-hyped scare story from Europe, or another ar-
gument for the precautionary principle in the EU. Coverage of and education about
nanotechnology in the United States is much more balanced and takes into account
the very real benefits of nanotechnology even as it speculates about risks.
Q3. Nanoelectronics  is  an  area  within  the  field  of  nanotechnology  that  is  certainly
important, and I am curious to hear a little more about its current status. Could
you give me a better sense of the work being conducted in this specific area, and
what  has  resulted  thus  far  from  this  research?  Approximately  how  much  fund-
ing  is  currently  devoted  to  nanoelectronics?  And  is  this  funding  adequate  for
what  is  needed  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  nanoelectronics  and  the  work  needed
to smooth the transfer of the research into commercial products?

A3. Nanoelectronics  research  provides  a  great  example  of  the  leverage  we  as  a  na-
tion  can  get  when  we  focus  on  goal  oriented  research.  The  Semiconductor  Industry
Association has established a Nanoelectronics Research Initiative which has teamed
with  National  Science  Foundation  and  NIST  to  help  shape  and  provide  industry
funding for critical beyond CMOS nanoelectronics research.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Joseph  S.  Krajcik,  Professor  of  Science  Education;  Associate  Dean  of

Research, University of Michigan

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What are the successes of the NNI over the past five years? Does the draft before
us preserve the elements that led to these successes? What parts of the NNI have
failed? Are there elements the Committee should consider terminating?

A1. I will limit my responses to my area of expertise: science education. Two bright
areas  resulted  from  the  NNI  over  the  past  five  years:  The  Nanoscale  Informal
Science  Education  (NISE)  Network  and  the  National  Center  for  Teaching  and
Learning Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NCLT). (Note: I am a co-principal in-
vestigator of NCLT and this relationship needs to be taken into consideration when
reading my remarks.)

NISE, funded through the National Science Foundation, 2005, is designed to bring
the  education  and  research  communities  together  in  an  effort  to  inform  the  public
about nanoscience. In particular the NISE Network:

scientists and engineers to the public;

• creates  new  methods  and  approaches  to  communicate  the  work  of  nanoscale
• informs the public about the advances in the scientific research; and
• captures  the  imagination  of  youth  who  may  choose  careers  in  nanoscale

science and engineering.

NISE has done much to bring nanoscale science to the public and I would encour-
age continual funding of the effort. Through a new web site, the NISE Network Re-
source  Center  (http://www.nisenet.org),  teachers  and  the  public  can  access  a  vast
collection  of  educational  resources  and  join  in  this  creative  community  effort.  For
teachers,  students,  or  anyone  interested  in  nanoscience  and  the  many  potential
nanotechnology  applications,  the  web  site’s  content  includes  study  materials,  aca-
demic  approaches,  collections  of  graphics,  a  newsletter,  links  to  other  institutions
working  in  the  field,  and  much  more.  To  learn  more  about  the  NISE  network  see:
http://www.nisenet.org/project/what.html.

NCLT,  funded  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  in  2004,  was  established  to
build  national  capacity  in  nanoscale  science  and  engineering  education  as  well  as
explore  how  to  how  to  improve  the  teaching  and  learning  of  nanoscience  in  grades
seven through college. Housed at Northwestern University, NCLT collaborates with
scientists  and  educators  at  the  following  research  institutions:  University  of  Michi-
gan,  Purdue  University,  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago,  University  of  Illinois  at
Urbana-Champaign,  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  Alabama  A&M  University,  Fisk
University,  Hampton  University,  Morehouse  College,  and  University  of  Texas  at  El
Paso.  Through  the  educational  research  produced  by  NCLT  researchers,  important
ideas related to the teaching and learning of nanoscience are being uncovered.

Through  its  web  portal  NCLT,  http://nclt.us/,  offers  a  variety  of  educational  re-
sources  to  help  teachers  and  science  educators  with  nanotechnology-related  con-
cepts, simulations, and activities for the classroom that include:

• Educational  materials  for  science  teachers  and  students  in  grades  7–12,  col-
lege  and  university  students  and  faculty,  researchers,  and  post-doc  students,
covering information on Nano Courses & Units in engineering, physics, mate-
rials science, chemistry, and education.

ing education.

Both NISE and NCLT have done much to advance learning of nanoscience in for-
mal and informal settings. As such, I would encourage that these aspects of The Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendments  Act  of  2008  be  preserved.  As  in
science, progress in education will only be made if continual support is provided for
projects  and  centers  that  focus  on  important  national  goals  and  that  have  proven
track  records  of  collaborative  partnerships  that  improve  the  teaching  and  learning

of nanoscience. As stated in my written testimony, advances in nanoscience require
a commensurate response from the educational community to prepare our youth.

The NNI also supports various national nanotechnology centers such as the Mate-
rials Research Science and Engineers Centers and the National Nanotechnology In-
frastructure  Network  that  have  an  educational  outreach  component  within  them.
Although  I  know  more  about  the  activities  NNIN  education  activities  that  go  on  at
the University of Michigan, I know little about other NNIM and MRSEC education
activities.  I  know  that  the  NNIN  education  activities  bring  new  emerging  activities
to  students  such  as  ‘‘nanocamps’’  that  allow  6th–12th  grade  students  opportunities
to explore clean rooms. Such activities have very high interest to many learners. As
such,  I  would  encourage  continual  funding  of  these  efforts.  However,  I  would  also
encourage that such centers partner with experts in science education and learning
science so that the engaging activities can be better incorporated into the structure
of  the  school  curriculum.  Building  such  connections  between  motivating  activities
and classroom curriculum is critical to promote learning.
Q2. How  would  you  address  the  concerns  of  those  who  might  perceive  Congress  as
picking  winners  and  losers  by  specifically  naming  areas  of  national  importance
in the legislation?

A2. There  is  no  argument  that  STEM  education  in  this  country  is  in  a  crisis.  U.S.
schools  are  failing  to  prepare  students  to  live  in  a  technological  advanced  society.
This  is  particularly  true  in  our  large  urban  districts.  If  we  can  turn  this  crisis
around, and we must, then we all win. Our economy will improve and perhaps more
importantly our children will have the standard of living and the quality of life that
we  achieved.  However,  unless  we  can  focus  on  improving  education,  our  children
and  their  children  will  not  have  the  quality  of  life  that  we  find  valuable.  Congress
has to provide the direction of our national priorities.

I would also argue that advances in science and technology are blurring the lines
between  the  individual  scientific  disciplines  that  allow  for  advances  in  science  and
technology. As science becomes more interdisciplinary, we can no longer rely on the
traditional  ways  of  teaching  science  as  a  set  of  well-understood,  clearly  depicted,
stand-alone  disciplines.  If  we  do  so,  we  are  not  preparing  our  students  for  the  sci-
entific enterprise they will experience in the work force. Yet, both at the K–12 level
and  13–16  level,  we  continue  to  teach  in  non-interdisciplinary  fashion  and  without
stressing how important ideas cut across disciplinary boundaries.
Q3. You  state  in  your  testimony  that  ‘‘Unfortunately,  the  current  education  system
is  failing  to  produce  a  populace  scientifically  literate  enough  to  understand  the
scientific advances of nanoscience.’’ Couldn’t the same be said for biology, phys-
ics,  chemistry,  computer  science,  or  many  other  scientific  disciplines?  If  current
science  curricula  concentrates  on  covering  too  much  content,  as  you  argue,  and
yet you also recommend that all students need to know more about nanoscience,
then what content do you propose replacing?

A3. I  agree  that  the  U.S.  educational  system  is  failing  to  produce  a  populace  that
is  scientifically  literate  to  understand  the  advances  in  all  fields  of  science  and  not
just nanoscience. What we are failing to do as a Nation is help students understand
the  ‘‘core’’  or  ‘‘big’’  ideas  of  science  that  are  essential  in  helping  all  learners  under-
stand advances across fields.

The  U.S.  science  curriculum  concentrates  on  covering  too  much  content  without
focusing  on  developing  deep,  meaningful  understanding  that  learners  will  need  to
grasp the central ideas of science and new areas or that they will need to make per-
sonal  and  professional  decisions  in  their  lives.  Research  has  shown  that  students
lack fundamental understanding of science in such areas as the structure of matter,
forces,  and  properties  of  matter.  These  fundamental  ideas  are  essential  to  under-
standing a number of areas of science.

As  I  tried  to  argue  in  my  written  testimony,  a  path  to  improve  the  U.S.  edu-
cational  system  requires  the  development  of  new  standards.  New  standards  that
focus on the big ideas of science and cut across disciplines, and other knowledge es-
sential for the 21st century need to be developed and adapted by schools. Important
ideas  in  nanoscience  are  not  currently  incorporated  or  stressed  in  the  national
standards.  Nanoscience  education  introduces  students  to  emerging  ideas  of  science
and  supports  understanding  of  the  interconnections  between  the  traditional  sci-
entific  domains  by  providing  compelling,  real-world  interdisciplinary  examples  of
science in action.

The  national  science  education  standards  need  renovation  because  there  are  too
many  standards.  We  will  need  to  make  some  tough  choices  in  that  all  content  can-
not be covered. We know from successes in other countries and from research stud-
ies,  that  attempting  to  cover  too  many  ideas  lead  students  to  develop  superficial

knowledge that they cannot use to solve problems, make decisions, and understand
phenomena.  Hence,  our  national  science  education  standards  need  reworking,  up-
dating and consolidating.

Rather  than  focusing  on  covering  too  many  ideas,  our  nation  needs  a  long-term
developmental  approach  to  learning  science  that  focuses  on  the  big  ideas  of  science
we most care about and takes into consideration learners’ prior knowledge and how
ideas  build  upon  each  other.  Big  ideas  provide  a  framework  for  thinking  about  the
long-term  development  of  student  understanding  and  they  facilitate  learners  to  un-
derstand  a  variety  of  different  phenomena  within  and  across  science  disciplines.  If
we  have  a  developmental  approach  starting  in  kindergarten  through  12th  grade,
learners  will  come  away  with  a  level  of  understanding  that  will  allow  them  to  pur-
sue  STEM  careers,  see  the  importance  of  science  in  their  lives,  and  use  science  to
make decisions. If our nation takes a developmental approach to the standards that
emphasize  how  ideas  build  upon  each  other,  it  will  allow  curriculum  designers  to
develop coherent curriculum materials.

Let  me  provide  just  one  short  example.  The  atomic  and  kinetic  theories  are  the
foundation  for  understanding  the  structure,  properties  and  behavior  of  matter.  To-
gether, they can explain an enormous number of phenomena across a variety of dis-
ciplines. At the same time, understanding of these ideas is essential for building an
understanding  about  the  structure,  properties  and  behavior  of  matter  at  the
nanoscale. A development approach focusing on how these ideas build over time will
allow  students  to  build  the  rich  understanding  that  is  needed  to  understand  the
science  of  today  and  tomorrow  and  will  facilitate  the  interdisciplinary  connections
that students need to understand nanoscience and other emerging science (Stevens,
Sutherland,  Shank  &  Krajcik,  2008).  I  encourage  the  Committee  to  read  Steven,
Sutherland,  Shank  and  Krajcik  for  more  in-depth  ideas  in  this  area.  I  also  encour-
age  the  Committee  to  read  Taking  Science  to  School,  by  Duschl,  Schweinger,  and
Shouse (2007).

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. As  we  know,  many  companies  who  have  taken  advantage  of  the  benefits  of
nanotechnology  choose  not  to  advertise  this  fact  in  their  products,  for  fear  of
public backlash. I understand their concerns, as I do not believe the general pub-
lic has a solid understanding of nanotechnology. Does the legislation do enough

additional  international  cooperation  needed  to  assist  the  United  States  in  edu-
cating  our  citizens?  Can  you  give  some  examples  of  what  other  countries  are
doing to inform and educate their people?

A1. An informed citizenship is critical in a democratic society. I am appalled by the
notion that information is being kept from the public because of fear of public back-
lash.  To  be  a  free,  democratic  and  competitive  country,  our  goal,  as  a  nation,  must
be to provide a solid education for ALL so that information is freely available to the
public  and  that  they  requisite  skills  to  interpret  and  apply  the  information  to  their
lives. Given that nanoscience impacts virtually every sector of our economy and our
daily lives by enabling promising new materials and applications across many fields,
I  would  argue  that  the  legislation  does  not  go  far  enough  to  enhance  public  aware-
ness and education in the field nanotechnology.

There are some bright spots in nanoeducation in this country. Two of them I have
discussed  above—the  NISE  Network  and  the  NCLT.  NISE  focuses  primarily  on  in-
formal  education  and  NCLT  on  formal  education.  Information  regarding  NISE  is
available  at  http://www.nisenet.org  and  for  NCLT  at  http://www.nclt.us/.  That
said,  I  believe  the  U.S.  formal  and  informal  education  systems  could  learn  through
international cooperation with other countries that are working to inform the public
regarding nanoscience. The NCLT web site has information on what other countries
are doing.

Below  I  will  summarize  some  of  the  information  about  what  other  countries  are
doing.  See  http://www.nclt.us/nclthome/major¥nano¥initiatives.html  for  further
information.

a. Taiwan  is  an  international  leader  in  nanotechnology  education,  with  formal
and  informal  education  initiatives  for  all  levels  and  an  especially  strong  K–
12  program.  The  National  Science  Council,  Taiwan,  R.O.C.,  established  a
nanotechnology  program  for  K–12  teachers  in  order  to  provide  educational
opportunities on the cutting edge of advanced technology.

c. Nanotechnology  Researchers  Network  Center  of  Japan  (NanoNet),  launched

tailored  to  children  and  includes  games  that  can  help  children  learn  about
nanoscience.

Q2. Nanoelectronics  is  an  area  within  the  field  of  nanotechnology  that  is  certainly
important and I am curious to hear a little more about its current status. Could
you give me a better sense of the work being conducted in this specific area, and
what has resulted this far from this research? Approximately how much funding
is  currently  devoted  to  nanoelectronics?  And  is  this  funding  adequate  for  what
is  needed  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  nanoelectronics  and  the  work  needed  to
smooth the transfer of the research into commercial products?

A2. This is not my area of research, so I do not feel qualified to respond.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Andrew  D.  Maynard,  Chief  Science  Advisor,  Project  on  Emerging

Nanotechnologies, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What are the successes of the NNI over the past five years? Does the draft before
us preserve the elements that led to these successes? What parts of the NNI have
failed? Are there elements the Committee should consider terminating?

A1. Over  the  past  five  years,  the  NNI  has  stimulated  innovative  research  enabling
the  United  States  to  lead  the  world  in  nanotech  research  and  development.  It  is  a
testament  to  this  success  that  other  countries  are  emulating  the  U.S.  model.  The
NNI  has  also  effectively  fostered  a  high  degree  of  coordination  across  a  large  num-
ber of agencies and departments, resulting in multi-disciplinary research that is es-
sential for supporting and sustaining successful nanotechnologies.

In my opinion, it is clear that the NNI has led to greater cross-government coordi-
nation for science and technology than with any previous initiative, and for this, its
instigators, supporters and implementers should be congratulated. But this does not
mean  that  there  is  cause  for  complacency.  While  the  achievements  of  the  NNI  are
apparent, there are areas that are in desperate need of improvement:

• The lack of a robust environmental, health and safety (EHS) research strategy
has led to insufficient funding and leadership to effectively study and combat-
possible EHS issues associated with nanotechnologies. From my assessment of
what 
long-term  success  of  emerging
nanotechnologies  and  provide  industry  with  the  confidence  to  invest  in  this
area,  a  minimum  10  percent  of  the  NNI  budget  should  be  directed  towards
EHS  research.  But  this  funding  must  be  directed  within  a  top-down  strategy
with clearly defined goals, and a plan for achieving them. At an absolute min-
imum, steps are needed to ensure sufficient funds are available to regulatory
and research agencies in support of strategic activities constituting the Envi-
ronmental, Health, and Safety program component area, or any successor pro-
gram component area.

• Full  and  transparent  stakeholder  involvement  in  the  NNI  is  lacking.  This  is
most apparent in the development of the EHS R&D strategy. While there are
some  interactions  between  the  NNI  and  stakeholders  representing  industry,
labor, academia, citizens and the international community, more is needed to
ensure  that  government-funded  research  and  development  remains  relevant.
For instance, the recent NNI EHS R&D strategy involved limited stakeholder
input  at  the  review  stage,  but  not  as  it  was  being  developed.  Had  a  wider
community  been  engaged  at  an  earlier  stage,  it  is  likely  that  the  strategy
would  be  more  focused  on  addressing  real  priority  needs,  rather  than  justi-
fying past actions.

• The NNI has struggled to support the translation of research into viable com-
mercial  products.  In  many  ways,  this  is  understandable,  as  the  initial  phase
of  the  NNI  was  focused  on  expanding  the  nanotechnology  knowledge  base
through  research.  But  as  nanotechnology  commercialization  becomes  an  in-
creasingly  pressing  challenge,  a  change  of  emphasis  and  mode  of  action  is

picking  winners  and  losers  by  specifically  naming  areas  of  national  importance
in the legislation?

A2. Addressing  major  challenges  facing  society  needs  leadership  from  the  top.
Nanotechnology  is  an  enabling  technology  and  will  provide  the  tools  to  solve  many
of  society’s  pressing  problems—including  global  climate  change,  pollution  and  dis-
ease. When resources are limited, strategic direction from the top is essential to en-
sure  progress  is  made  towards  safe  and  successful  technological  solutions.  This  is
not choosing winners and losers; but rather foreseeing innovations and technologies
that  the  United  States  can  lead  the  world  in.  Without  Congress  leading  the  way,
we risk jeopardizing nanotechnology innovation in the U.S. and lessening the chance
of  nanotechnology  R&D  stimulating  the  economy,  creating  jobs,  solving  major  envi-
ronmental  challenges  and  improving  quality  of  life.  Other  economies  around  the
world  are  unlikely  to  hold  back  on  strategic  R&D  leadership  where  there  are  clear
social  and  economic  advantages,  and  for  the  U.S.  to  do  so  would  place  the  country
at a disadvantage.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. As  we  know,  many  companies  who  have  taken  advantage  of  the  benefits  of
nanotechnology  choose  not  to  advertise  this  fact  in  their  products,  for  fear  of
public backlash. I understand their concerns, as I do not believe the general pub-
lic has a solid understanding of nanotechnology. Does the legislation do enough
to  enhance  public  awareness  and  education  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology?  Is
additional  international  cooperation  needed  to  assist  the  United  States  in  edu-
cating our citizens? Can you give us some examples of what countries are doing
to inform and educate their people?

A1. There  is  currently  not  enough  being  done  to  inform  and  educate  members  of
the public on how nanotechnology will impact their lives, or to engage them in how
future  technologies  are  developed  and  used.  And  while  the  draft  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative  Amendment  Act  of  2008  addresses  K  though  12  and  col-
lege education, it is lacking when it comes to supporting broader educational issues.
Formal education in terms of training future scientists is getting better and will im-
prove  further  through  various  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and  Mathematics
Education  initiatives.  But  empowering  everyday  people  to  make  informed  decisions
about the technologies that affect their lives is critically lacking.

Transparency is vital to the success of nanotechnology; not only regarding govern-
ment  investment,  actions  and  plans,  but  also  in  providing  people  with  information
on  how  nanotechnology  is  being  used  in  products  and  processes  that  affect  their
daily  lives.  Opinion  polls—including  those  conducted  by  the  Project  on  Emerging
Nanotechnologies2—show that people want to be informed, and a perception of being
kept in the dark seriously undermines confidence in new technologies and their pro-
moters.

Yet to be useful, transparency must be linked to an ability to understand and use
information  effectively.  And  this  places  a  bright  spotlight  on  education—especially
informal education, which takes place outside the classroom.

Effective  nanotechnology  education  means  meeting  people  where  they  are  at—
whether through popular culture, the media or museums and exhibits. Government
and  industry  need  to  invest  much  more  in  informal  education  if  an  awareness  and
understanding of nanotechnology is to diffuse through society. And this needs to be
an investment in education, rather than academic studies of how to educate.

But beyond education comes engagement—you cannot give people the tools to un-
derstand new technologies, but then deny them a voice in the decision-making proc-
ess. Effective engagement efforts are currently lacking in the NNI, and in the draft
bill.

In contrast to the U.S., the European Union has clear goals for educating and en-
gaging citizens. In its policy for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies,3 the European
Union  recognizes  ‘‘the  need  to  devote  due  attention  to  the  societal  aspects  of
nanotechnology’’ and sets forth the following:

a. calls  upon  the  Member  States  to  pursue  an  open  and  proactive  approach  to
governance  in  nanotechnology  R&D  to  ensure  public  awareness  and  con-
fidence;

b. encourages a dialogue with EU citizens/consumers to promote informed judg-
ment  on  nanotechnology  R&D  based  on  impartial  information  and  the  ex-
change of ideas;

c. reaffirms  its  commitment  to  ethical  principals  in  order  to  ensure  that  R&D
in  nanotechnology  is  carried  out  in  a  responsible  and  transparent  manner.
Q2. Nanoelectronics  is  an  area  within  the  field  of  nanotechnology  that  is  certainly
important, and I am curious to hear a little more about its current status. Could
you give me a better sense of the work being conducted in this specific area, and
what  has  resulted  thus  far  from  this  research?  Approximately  how  much  fund-
ing  is  currently  devoted  to  nanoelectronics?  And  is  this  funding  adequate  for
what  is  needed  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  nanoelectronics  and  the  work  needed
to smooth the transfer of the research into commercial products?

A2. This is not my primary area of expertise, and I would defer to my fellow panel
member, Dr. Robert Doering, for a detailed answer to the question. But I would like
to make a couple of observations:

Complementary  Metal  Oxide  Semiconductor  technology—commonly  referred  to  as
CMOS—is  the  foundation  of  modern  electronics.  Yet  while  the  processing  power  of
semiconductor  chips  continues  to  double  almost  every  two  years,  it  will  soon  hit  a
brick  wall—the  point  where  physical  laws  prevent  conventional  CMOS-based  elec-
tronics  getting  any  smaller  or  faster.  Nanotechnology  is  a  key  technology  for  over-
coming  this  barrier;  enabling  existing  technologies  to  be  used  in  innovative  ways;
generating  new  electronics  technologies  to  replace  CMOS,  and  even  discovering  al-
ternatives to using electrons—such as photons, in the area of photonics.

The  timescale  between  innovation  and  implementation  is  long  in  the  electronics
business however, and it is the research of today that will provide technological so-
lutions  of  the  next  decade.  As  a  result,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  extensive  re-
search  now  into  new  nanotechnology-based  ‘‘electronics’’  or  ‘‘nanoelectronics’’  if  we
want  to  continue  the  current  trend  of  faster,  smaller,  more  efficient  processors.  In-
dustry is acutely aware of this challenge, and is investing considerable resources in
supporting  innovative  research.  But  support  from  government  is  also  needed,  if
America is to remain at the forefront of the nanoelectronics revolution.

Question submitted by Representative Adrian Smith
Q1. At the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), researchers are studying
nanomedicine, which merges engineering science with pharmaceutical and med-
ical sciences, to translate advances in nanotechnology research into clinical prac-
tice. UNMC researchers have been recognized nationally and internationally for
developing tiny particles, called nanomaterials, which are put in the body to de-
liver drugs precisely to diseased cells, to treat conditions such as cancer, Parkin-
son’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and others. This unique nanotechnology delivers
drugs  directly  to  diseased  areas  or  tumors,  which  maximizes  clinical  benefits,
while  limiting  negative  side  effects.  The  use  of  nanoscale  technologies  to  design
drug  delivery  systems  is  a  rapidly  developing  area  of  biomedical  research  that
promises  breakthrough  advances  in  therapeutics  and  diagnostics.  It  is  clear
from  the  medical  research  in  Nebraska  that  the  development  of  medical
nanotechnology  is  moving  quickly  toward  human  clinical  trials.  At  the  October
hearing on this subject, according to the briefing document, ‘‘there were concern
that the interagency planning for and implementation of the environment, health
and  safety  research  component  of  NNI  was  not  moving  with  the  urgency  it  de-
served.’’  Development  of  nanotechnology  is  breakthrough  technology  with  the

ability to profoundly improve the treatment and cure of disease. This legislation
intends  to  strengthen  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  environment,
health and safety component and increase the emphasis on commercialization of
nanotechnology  research  results.  To  accomplish  that,  guidelines  will  be  nec-
essary.  What  progress  is  being  made  to  establish  safety  guidelines  for  the  use
of nanotechnology to deliver medication when it is ready for the marketplace and
adopted as standard of care by health care professionals?

A1. New  nanotechnology-enabled  drugs  push  the  boundaries  of  our  understanding
and  abilities.  They  penetrate  to  places  in  the  body  and  interact  with  cells  and  tis-
sues  in  new  ways,  because  of  their  nanoscale  size  and  structure.  They  can  be  de-
signed  to  carry  out  many  functions;  detecting  and  diagnosing  disease,  as  well  as
treating  it.  And  they  often  blur  the  boundaries  between  distinct  regulatory  classes
of products. These characteristics offer the promise of innovative new medical treat-
ments. But they also raise new concerns over possible health implications.

Some progress is being made to address the challenge of developing safe and ben-
eficial nanotechnology-based drugs. For instance, the FDA, in partnership with Na-
tional  Cancer  Institute  and  the  National  Institute  for  Standards  and  Technology,
has set up the Nanoparticle Characterization Laboratory to help evaluate the safety
of  developmental  nano-drugs.  But  the  pace  of  development  and  the  increasingly  so-
phisticated nature of these medications are stretching the ability of researchers and
regulators to apply conventional understanding to these unconventional products.

The  United  States  cannot  afford  to  not  develop  drugs  enhanced  with
nanotechnology.  They  promise  to  be  more  effective  treatments  with  fewer  side  ef-
fects;  and  have  the  ability  to  treat  previously  untreatable  diseases.  But  if  we  lose
focus  and  don’t  get  the  environment,  health  and  safety  aspects  of  these  products  of
nanotechnology  right,  those  benefits  will  be  lost.  This  is  why  adequate  funding,
along  with  strong  leadership  and  a  robust  risk  research  strategy,  are  essential  to
ensuring  nanotech-enabled  drugs  don’t  lead  to  unanticipated  harm.  This  is  a  small
price  to  pay  in  order  to  reap  the  enormous  benefits  nanotechnology  could  provide.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Raymond  David,  Manager  of  Toxicology  for  Industrial  Chemicals,

BASF Corporation

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Is  there  a  need  to  expand  the  availability  of  nanotechnology  user  facilities  that
would be relevant to industry’s needs? If so, would the NNI Industry-University
Research  Centers  model  be  a  viable  mechanism  for  expanding  the  number  and
diversity of nanotechnology user facilities? Under such a model, federal funding
would  support  the  initial  start-up  costs,  administration,  and  staffing  needs  of
the user facility, while industry would provide the bulk of funding through user
fees for use of the facilities.

A1. The  Panel  believes  that  there  may  be  a  lack  of  awareness  of  user  facilities
available  to  the  nanotechnology  community,  which  may  lead  to  their  under-utiliza-
tion  by  industry.  Furthermore,  some  of  the  centers  have  very  focused  missions,
which  do  not  allow  for  projects  outside  of  their  scope.  For  example,  the
Nanomaterials  Characterization  Laboratory  focuses  on  medical  applications  of
nanomaterials  and  the  laboratory  will  not  accept  a  project  outside  of  that  scope.  A
partnership approach similar to the NSF Industry-University Research Centers may
be  a  more  viable  model,  and  would  certainly  be  more  flexible.  It  would  also  allow
SME nanotechnology companies to obtain the services they need without the exten-
sive capital investment needed for instrumentation.
Q2. To  what  extent  are  nanotechnology  businesses  engaged  in  educational  outreach
activities with high school students or post-secondary students? Do your compa-
nies sponsor activities at informal science institutions?

A2. Panel  members  experience  indicates  that  outreach  programs  are  most  success-
ful  through  large  associations  or  scientific  societies.  For  example,  the  Society  of
Toxicology  has  an  outreach  program  to  elementary  and  secondary  schools  called
‘‘Paracelsus goes to school.’’ It is well organized and successful in educating students
about toxicology, dose-response, and specific hazards to avoid. The NNI could estab-
lish  a  similarly  structured  program.  The  companies  of  the  ACC  Nanotechnology
Panel  also  sponsor  informational  events  for  targeted  audiences,  maintain  a  web
page  that  provides  information  to  the  public,  and  engage  in  extensive  outreach  to
various  constituencies  to  provide  information  pertinent  to  the  safe  and  responsible
development of nanotechnology. Panel member companies would welcome the oppor-
tunity  to  provide  input  and  experts  for  informal  scientific  sessions  with  students  of
all ages.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. It 

is  our  understanding 

that  responsible  manufacturers  and  users  of
nanomaterials, including presumably some ACC members, are generating infor-
mation about their properties that could be relevant to understanding their bio-
logical and environmental behavior. How can that information be shared so that
risk  assessment  and  risk  management  in  general  can  be  improved  and  so  that
developers can design more benign materials and avoid pitfalls?

A1. Scientists  from  industry,  academia,  and  government  research  facilities  are  en-
gaged  in  developing  data  on  the  hazards  of  nanomaterials,  and  the  physical/chem-
ical  properties  that  are  associated  with  those  hazards.  Once  these  data  are  pub-
lished  in  scientific  journals,  there  are  several  public  databases  that  capture  and
catalogue the information for others to use in assessing the risks of exposure. Unfor-
tunately, the Nanotechnology Panel believes that some of the published data fail to
accurately  characterize  the  properties  of  the  particles  tested.  International  efforts
within  the  OECD,  ISO  and  private  efforts  to  heighten  awareness  for  the  need  for
accurate  characterization  will  help  sort  these  issues  out.  In  addition,  EPA’s
Nanoscale  Materials  Stewardship  Program  (NMSP)  is  designed  to  collect  informa-
tion  for  EPA’s  use  to  develop  risk  assessment  and  management  profiles.  Additional
information  will  facilitate  EPA’s  ability  to  characterize  nanoscale  materials  accu-
rately. The Panel members will be participating in this program.
Q2. What are the successes of the NNl over the past five years? Does the draft before
us preserve the elements that led to these successes? What parts of the NNI have
failed? Are there elements the Committee should consider terminating?

A2. A  key  NNI  success  has  been  providing  a  mechanism  for  information  exchange
between government agencies regarding nanotechnology. It appears that the enthu-
siasm  for  this  is  high  as  indicated  by  the  broad  participation  of  agencies.  Partici-
pating agencies include those conducting research as well as regulatory bodies show-
ing  an  awareness  of  the  linkage  between  these  normally  separate  approaches.  The
main function of the NNI is to promote the development of nanotechnology and this
appears  to  have  been  a  great  success.  A  perceived  weakness,  however,  has  been  an
incommensurate  level  of  commitment  of  NNI  agency  resources  to  issues  regarding
society and safety. Many view government agencies as an ‘‘honest broker’’ thus they
have a unique role and contribution to make to help ensure that nanotechnology un-
dergoes  responsible  development.  A  commitment  of  the  NNI  for  a  significant  in-
crease  in  member  agency  funding  over  present  levels  to  address  EHS  issues  will
greatly  contribute  to  its  future  success.  A  target  of  8–15  percent  of  overall  NNI
spending  should  be  considered  to  fund  EHS  activities  and  is  consistent  with  Goal
4 of the NNI Strategic Plan.
Q3. How  would  you  address  the  concerns  of  those  who  might  perceive  Congress  as
picking  winners  and  losers  by  specifically  naming  areas  of  national  importance
in the legislation?

A3. Neither Congress nor the NNl agencies should be viewed as picking winners or
losers. The breadth of activities and interests of the member agencies are sufficient
to  encompass  many  of  the  activities  for  which  funding  will  be  sought.  However,  it
is  appropriate  for  Congress  to  identify  and  focus  attention  on  areas  that  it  believes
will have particularly beneficial impacts.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. As  we  know,  many  companies  who  have  taken  advantage  of  the  benefits  of
nanotechnology  choose  not  to  advertise  this  fact  in  their  products,  for  fear  of
public backlash. I understand their concerns, as I do not believe the general pub-
lic has a solid understanding of nanotechnology. Does the legislation do enough
to  enhance  public  awareness  and  education  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology?  Is
additional  international  cooperation  needed  to  assist  the  United  States  in  edu-
cating  our  citizens?  Can  you  give  us  some  examples  of  what  other  countries  are
doing to inform and educate their people?

A1. The NNI amendments do not specifically address education of the general pub-
lic.  This  could  be  addressed  in  any  number  of  ways  not  the  least  of  which  are  tar-
geted informational programs through the Public Broadcasting Service, Public Serv-
ice  Announcements,  or  other  media.  The  NNI  amendments  do  provide  for  the  edu-
cation  of  secondary  teachers  and  students,  which  in  turn  will  lead  to  better  edu-
cating the general public. The concern expressed in the question may be a symptom
of  an  overall  lack  of  public  understanding  about  the  many  positive  contributions  to
society  and  safety  made  through  the  use  of  science  and  engineering.  The  Act  does
provide  for  funding  to  be  available  for  projects  in  subcategories  of  education  in  for-
mal  (e.g.,  schools,  colleges,  universities)  and  informal  settings  (e.g.,  museums  and
exhibits) as well as for public outreach and societal issues. The Department of Edu-
cation is a new NNI agency and this could be an area where DOEd can make strong
contributions  to  the  success  of  the  NNI  since  education  is  its  primary  mission.  In
addition, the NNI amendments could include scholarship funding for graduate level
courses  to  further  train  scientists  in  the  various  disciplines  associated  with
nanotechnology.
Q2. Nanoelectronics  is  an  area  within  the  field  of  nanotechnology  that  is  certainly
important, and I am curious to hear a little more about its current status. Could

ing is devoted to nanoelectronics? And is this funding adequate for what is need-
ed to tackle the challenges of nanoelectronics and the work needed to smooth the
transfer of the research into commercial products?

A2. The chemical industry is a key supplier of materials to the electronics industry.
While  the  specific  question  is  best  directed  to  those  who  are  in  the  nanoelectronics
industry we are pleased to make essential contributions to their success. SEMI rep-
resents the semiconductor producers and may be able to provide additional informa-
tion.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Robert  R.  Doering,  Senior  Fellow  and  Research  Strategy  Manager,

Texas Instruments

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. Is  there  a  need  to  expand  the  availability  of  nanotechnology  user  facilities  that
would be relevant to industry’s needs? If so, would the NSF Industry-University
Research  Centers  model  be  a  viable  mechanism  for  expanding  the  number  and

would  support  the  initial  start-up  costs,  administration,  and  staffing  needs  of
the user facility, while industry would provide the bulk of funding through user
fees for use of the facilities.

A1. In  terms  of  infrastructure,  many  U.S.  universities  and  some  federal  labs  have
excellent  facilities  for  doing  micro-electronics  research,  but  nanoelectronics  may  re-
quire  more  specialized  tools  for  fabricating  and  characterizing  these  structures  to
move beyond the initial single device lab demonstrations. SIA estimates this will re-
quire  an  order  of  magnitude  above  current  National  Nanotechnology  Infrastructure
Network  (NNIN)  investments,  which  are  roughly  $15M.  We  are  pleased  to  see  the
revised  bill  includes  an  assessment  of  equipment/infrastructure  needs  in  the  areas
of national importance.

The  Industry-University  Research  Centers  model  may  be  instructive,  but  given
the  modest  investment  of  NSF  through  this  program,  it  would  not  be  adequate  for
addressing  the  needs  in  nanoelectronics,  particularly  once  the  technology  dem-
onstration phase begins. With its investment in equipment and facilities at a range
of universities, expanding the infrastructure created by NNIN may be a more appro-
priate  model  for  the  semiconductor  industry.  The  NSECs  also  provide  an  excellent
resource  for  industry  to  work  collaboratively  with  universities,  such  as  through  the
co-funding of proposals that NSF has undertaken with the Nanoelectronics Research
Initiative (NRI).

In  addition,  the  modeling  capabilities  NSF  has  funded  through  the  Network  for
Computational  Nanotechnology  (NCN,  Purdue  University)  have  been  extremely
helpful  for  industry  in  experimental/test  and  theoretical  simulations  of  various  op-
tions  under  NRI.  NCN  is  an  excellent  model  of  a  university-based  facility  which  is
easily accessible and frequently used by industry.
Q2. To  what  extent  are  nanotechnology  businesses  engaged  in  educational  outreach
activities with high school students or post-secondary students? Do your compa-
nies sponsor activities at informal science institutions?

A2. At  Texas  Instruments,  education  is  the  highest  priority  for  corporate  philan-
thropy.  Each  year,  TI  makes  financial  contributions  totaling  millions  of  dollars  in
grants  and  other  gifts  to  schools,  colleges  and  educational  programs.  TI  supports  a
number  of  programs  focused  on  fostering  student  interest  and  achievement  in
science, technology, engineering and math.

pany/citizen/factsheets/cte.shtml

TI  and  Southern  Methodist  University  co-developed  the  Infinity  Project,  which
uses MP3 players and cell phones to teach engineering and science concepts to high
school students in 275 schools in 37 states.

Since the early 1990s, TI engineers have been helping high school students in the
Texas BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology) competition that chal-
lenges  students  to  build  remote-controlled  robots,  attracting  nearly  700  middle  and
high schools and more than 8,000 students across several states each fall.

At the university level, TI was a leader in establishing and funding the Texas En-
gineering and Technical Consortium (TETC). TETC supports recruitment and reten-
tion  of  electrical  engineering  and  computer  science  majors  at  34  universities  in
Texas. From 2001 to 2006, electrical engineering graduates at TETC funded institu-
tions increased by 49 percent compared to a 10 percent increase by other state and
national institutions. Computer science graduates have declined across the U.S. The
number  of  graduates  at  TETC  institutions  have  only  declined  by  six  percent  com-
pared to the national decline of 24 percent.

Q1. What are the successes of the NNI over the past five years? Does the draft before
us preserve the elements that led to these successes? What parts of the NNI have
failed? Are there elements the Committee should consider terminating?

The  NRI 

A1. Over  the  past  five  years,  the  National  Nanotechnology  Coordinating  Office
(NNCO)  has  advanced  U.S.  nanotechnology  research  by  providing  a  focal  point  for
federal  activities  in  nanotechnology,  leading  to  the  development  of  strategic  plans
that identified program component areas, and brought together key stakeholders for
workshops on major nanotechnology topics.

leveraging
nanotechnology-focused  federal  investments  such  as  the  NSF’s  activities  at  NSECs
and the NNIN, and NIST’s expertise in metrology at the nanoscale.

is  certainly  a  model  partnership  under  the  NNI, 

To  quote  the  most  recent  NNI  strategic  plan  profile  of  the  NRI,  ‘‘these  govern-
ment-industry-academic  partnerships  blend  the  discovery  mission  of  NSF,  the  tech-
nology  innovation  mission  of  NIST,  the  practical  perspective  of  industry,  and  the
technical expertise of U.S. universities to address a nanotechnology research and de-
velopment priority. It is one example of the creative methods the NNI uses to accel-
erate research that contributes to the Nation’s economic competitiveness.’’

A  major  shortcoming  of  the  NNI  currently  is  that  it  does  not  have  a  mechanism
to prioritize interagency activity and resources around nanotechnology research that
addresses the most critical challenges facing our country. The bill’s identification of
areas of national importance is essential to ensuring that this occurs.

Further,  the  NNI  would  benefit  from  clearer  metrics  and  time  frames  for  both
near- and long-term objectives, including plans for technology transition with indus-
try and the states. The bill’s call for this to be addressed in the strategic plan allows
better measurement of progress towards NNI goals. The explicit funding mechanism
for  the  NNCO  and  authorization  of  travel  expenditures  are  also  positive  proposals
for improving the way the NNI is planned and implemented.
Q2. How  would  you  address  the  concerns  of  those  who  might  perceive  Congress  as
picking  winners  and  losers  by  specifically  naming  areas  of  national  importance
in the legislation?

A2. It  is  important  that  the  bill  recognizes  that  projects  in  these  areas  will  be  se-
lected on a competitive and merit basis. It is appropriate for the legislation to iden-
tify some examples of areas of national importance, and call for the Advisory Panel
to  identify  additional  areas.  This  will  allow  NNI  to  prioritize  resources  around  na-
tional  challenges  that  would  benefit  from  breakthroughs  in  nanotechnology  and
where  the  Federal  Government  has  a  unique  role  in  funding  exploratory  research.
Q3. In  your  testimony  you  advocate  for  the  inclusion  of  security  as  a  major  area  of
national  importance.  Currently,  the  Department  of  Defense  accounts  for  more
spending under NNI than any other agency. However, the Department of Home-
land  Security  invests  just  one  million  dollars,  less  than  all  agencies  except  the
Department  of  Transportation.  Are  there  specific  areas  where  nanotechnology
can uniquely benefit homeland security that are being ignored currently?

A3. Security

nanotechnology  research.  Even  if  not  addressed  in  the  legislation,  this  topic  should
certainly  be  prominent  in  the  interagency  context.  For  example,  nanoelectronics
benefits national security in very many ways, including even smarter weapons, bet-
ter  and  quicker  situational  awareness,  lightweight  and  low-power  communication
devices, and a broad range of small sensors such as single-chip chemical and biologi-
cal  detection  and  analysis  platforms.  Nanomaterials  will  allow  lighter  and  stronger
vehicles, equipment, and armor for military and first responders.

that  will  benefit 

As  noted,  the  Department  of  Defense  invests  more  in  nanotechnology  research
than any other agency in NNI, and much of this research will have security applica-
tions. DHS should leverage promising nanotechnology research through NNI by pro-
viding its expertise and agency funding, where appropriate, for specific applications
related to its mission.
Q4. What difference can you identify between the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative
(NRI)  and  the  partnerships  described  in  Section  5  of  the  draft  legislation?  In
your  opinion,  what  effect  will  these  differences  have  on  the  success  of  further
partnerships?

A4. The  NRI  in  its  current  form  is  a  model  of  the  partnerships  envisioned  in  Sec-
tion 5, involving an industry consortium, universities, and two federal agencies. The
NRI  also  leverages  state  investment,  which  was  not  an  element  in  the  initial  draft
of  Section  5,  and  we  are  pleased  to  see  this  aspect  recognized  in  the  revised  text.

The major difference between the NRI and the partnerships envisioned in Section
5 is that currently under NNI, there is no designation as an area of national impor-
tance and such partnerships are not explicitly recognized. The legislation as drafted
will encourage such beneficial partnerships.

As NRI moves forward, its model may evolve to include technology demonstration
projects of promising concepts. This was not envisioned for partnerships in the origi-
nal Section 5, but we are pleased to see the bill as introduced recognizes this need.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. As  we  know,  many  companies  who  have  taken  advantage  of  the  benefits  of
nanotechnology  choose  not  to  advertise  this  facet  in  their  products,  for  fear  of
public backlash. I understand their concerns as I do not believe the general pub-
lic has a solid understanding of nanotechnology. Does the legislation do enough
to  enhance  public  awareness  and  education  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology?  Is
additional  international  cooperation  needed  to  assist  the  United  States  in  edu-
cating  our  citizens?  Can  you  give  us  some  examples  of  what  other  countries  are
doing to inform and educate their people?

A1. Certainly  improved  public  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  nanotechnology  and  re-
search  around  EHS  issues  will  assist  consumers  in  making  informed  decisions  and
reducing fears around nanotechnology.

ESH  issues  are  important,  but  should  not  eclipse  the  vast  potential  benefits  of
nanotechnology. The semiconductor industry is committed to ensuring that its lead-
ership in ESH continues as semiconductor technology advances.

To  help  meet  the  ESH  challenges  of  the  industry,  the  Semiconductor  Research
Corporation and SEMATECH, two industry consortia, sponsor the SRC/SEMATECH
Engineering  Research  Center  for  Environmentally  Benign  Semiconductor  Manufac-
turing, headquartered at the University of Arizona, and including researchers at 10
other leading universities.

The  industry  has  an  International  Technology  Roadmap  for  Semiconductors
(ITRS) that is developed by over 1000 scientists and engineers worldwide. The road-
map  includes  an  extensive  section  of  ESH  that  provides  direction  to  research  cen-
ters,  suppliers,  and  chip  makers  to  focus  on  the  both  short-term  (2005–2013)  and
long-term (2014–2020) challenges in chemical assessment and reduction, energy and
water  conservation,  and  sustainability  and  product  stewardship.  Specifically  there
is  recognition  of  how  the  industry’s  ESH  controls  should  be  studied  and  adjusted
as needed for nanomaterials.

From  an  education  standpoint,  nanotechnology  provides  an  excellent  opportunity
to  capture  young  imaginations  to  science—a  nanometer  is  so  small  it  could  fit
50,000  times  on  the  width  of  a  typical  human  hair.  The  bill’s  education  provisions,
particularly the Nanotechnology Education Partnerships at the NSF, provide appro-
priate mechanisms to generate teacher and student enthusiasm and undergraduate
interest in this area.

SIA  has  been  involved  in  the  International  Nanotechnology  Conference  on  Com-
munications  and  Coordination,  which  brings  together  industry,  academia,  and  gov-
ernment  officials  working  in  nanotechnology.  In  addition  to  research  topics,  pro-
grams  have  included  discussions  on  various  approaches  to  societal  and  educational
dimensions of nanotechnology.
Q2. Nanoelectronics  is  an  area  within  the  field  of  nanotechnology  that  is  certainly
important, and I am curious to hear a little more about its current status. Could
you give me a better sense of the work being conducted in this specific area, and
what  has  resulted  thus  far  from  this  research?  Approximately  how  much  fund-
ing  is  currently  devoted  to  nanoelectronics?  And  is  this  funding  adequate  for
what  is  needed  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  nanoelectronics  and  the  work  needed
to smooth the transfer of the research into commercial products?

A2. Nanoelectronics  research  is  focused  on  finding  the  new  ‘‘switch’’  to  replace  to-
day’s  transistor.  The  new  switch  must  be  extremely  reliable,  fast,  low  power,  func-
tionally  dense,  and  capable  of  being  manufactured  in  commercial  volumes  at  low
cost. There are a number of candidates for the new nanoelectronics switch, including
devices  based  on  spin  or  other  quantum  state  variables  rather  than  classical  bulk
electric charge. The NRI has identified several promising new phenomena that have
potential  to  become  advanced  switches,  such  as  pseudospintronics,  ballistic  aniso-
tropic  magneto-resistance,  spin  waves,  molecular  conformational  changes,  electron
wave interference, nanomagnet interactions, and excitons in both molecules and car-
bon  nanotubes  and  graphene.  In  particular,  there  is  a  large  amount  of  research

going  into  graphene,  which  is  showing  great  promise  as  a  new  material  to  support
a number of new device technologies.

However,  despite  this  long  list  of  promising  initial  concepts,  it  should  be  empha-
sized that we have a long way to go. Our understanding of many of these new phe-
nomena  is  in  its  infancy,  and  we  will  undoubtedly  find  many  challenges  and
showstoppers which will limit the ultimate potential of most of the candidates—this
is  the  nature  of  such  far-out  research.  It  also  underlines  the  urgency  for  investing
heavily now in many different areas.

Commercialization of devices based on these phenomena into a new class of inte-
grated circuits may very well require an entirely new nanomanufacturing paradigm.
Technology demonstration projects, as identified in the revised bill, will be required
to advance to the next phase and determine the viability of the various technologies.
Current  direct  NRI  funding  from  all  sources  (federal,  industry,  and  State)  totals
about  $25M  annually,  of  which  NIST  funds  about  $3M  per  year,  and  NSF  funds
$2M.

However,  an  aggregate

to  obtain—programs  are
disaggregated across agencies, and often not reported at such a detailed level. There
are  a  number  of  activities  relevant  to  nanoelectronics  outside  of  the  formal  NRI
partnerships with NSF and NIST. For example, the Department of Defense, largely
through  DARPA,  is  a  major  investor  in  nanoelectronics  research.  The  Department
of  Energy 
laboratories  conduct  activities  and  have  capabilities  relevant  to
nanoelectronics as well.

federal  agency 

The  2009  National  Science  Foundation  budget  request  was  the  first  time  the
agency included a $20M initiative for research addressing ‘‘Science and Engineering
Beyond Moore’s Law,’’ thus establishing a centralized figure for the agency’s activity
on this topic.

The  revision  to  Section  5  to  track  investments  in  the  areas  of  national  interest,
at  the  same  level  of  detail  as  is  currently  done  for  the  Program  Component  Areas
will  be  extremely  valuable  to  have  federal  investment  for  these  areas  available  in
a central location and to monitor trends.
Q3. States obviously play an important role in commercialization and translation of
promising  research  into  innovation,  which  in  turn  enhances  regional  economic
growth.  Does  the  legislation  sufficiently  address  the  role  of  the  states  in
nanotechnology?

investments 

A3. TI  and  SIA  agree  that  State  governments  can  play  an  important  role.  Section
4  of  the  draft  legislation  highlights  technology  transfer  and  explicitly  identifies  the
importance  of  State  leverage  through  research,  development,  and  technology  trans-
fer initiatives. We were pleased that the bill as introduced revised Section 5 to rec-
ognize  that  projects  in  areas  of  national  importance  should  leverage  State  funding
where possible.

For example, Texas created a $200M Emerging Technology Fund to invest in pub-
lic-private endeavors around emerging scientific or technology fields tied to competi-
tiveness;  match  federal  and  other  sponsored  investment  in  science;  and  attract  and
enhance  research  talent  superiority  in  Texas.  Several  other  states  have  similar
mechanisms. Of course, State governments are also critical in supporting public re-
search universities from an overall budget perspective.

States  have  provided  leveraged  funding  to  NRI  worth  at  least  $15M  annually  in
funding,  equipment,  and  faculty  endowments.  In  addition,  several  states  have  in-
vested in expansion or construction of new buildings related to nanotechnology. The
City  of  South  Bend,  with  the  new  Midwest  Academy  of  Nanoelectronics  and  Archi-
tectures (MANA) NRI center, will open an ‘‘Innovation Park’’ adjacent to the campus
designed to foster commercialization.

Questions submitted by Representative Michael T. McCaul
Q1. The NRI SWAN center based at the University of Texas Austin includes signifi-
cant  resources  from  the  State  of  Texas,  the  University  of  Texas  System,  and
Texas industry. Specifically, how does this provide leverage to the federal invest-
ment in NRI research and benefit universities outside of the University of Texas
System?

A1. While Texas and other states have provided resources to the four regional NRI
centers, it is important to note that these regional centers are ‘‘virtual’’ and involve
researchers from several universities outside these states. Collaborative research oc-
curs  on  a  national  level  at  all  35  participating  universities.  In  addition  to  UT–Aus-

Notre Dame, Maryland, NC State, and Univ. of Illinois–C.

The  SWAN  $30M  in  matching  funds  is  focused  on  attracting  and  supporting  top
academic  researchers  in  nanoelectronics.  Specifically,  this  is  a  three-way  match,
with the State of Texas contributing $10M from the Emerging Technology Fund, the
University of Texas System matching with $10M, and the remaining $10M contrib-
uted by Texas industry for endowed chairs, including $5M from TI. Like similar in-
vestments in other states, these funds are restricted to support faculty at public in-
stitutions in the state. However, such state investments indirectly benefit other uni-
versities  participating  in  the  various  centers  by  enabling  research  capacity  and  in-
