COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Tsunamis: Is the U.S. Prepared?

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On January 26, 2005, the House Committee on Science will hold a hearing to bet-
ter  understand  the  causes  of  tsunamis,  the  risks  they  may  pose  to  the  U.S.  and  to
the rest of the world, and how the U.S. should prepare for them.

Although tsunamis are infrequent, their force and destructive power have recently
become  all  too  clear.  On  December  26,  2004,  a  magnitude  9.0  undersea  earthquake
off  the  west  coast  of  northern  Sumatra,  Indonesia,  unleashed  a  tsunami  that  af-
fected  more  than  12  countries  throughout  Southeast  Asia  and  stretched  as  far  as
the  northeastern  African  coast.  Massive  tsunami  waves  hit  the  Indonesian  coast
within  minutes  of  the  earthquake,  and  other  deadly  waves  raced  across  the  entire
3,000-mile span of the Indian Ocean Basin within hours. Current estimates indicate
that  at  least  150,000  people  were  killed,  and  millions  more  were  injured,  displaced
or  otherwise  affected.  Experts  believe  that  the  earthquake  which  caused  the  tsu-
nami was the most powerful in 40 years and the fourth largest in the last century.
The death toll appears to be the worst on record for a tsunami.

While  no  tsunami  has  caused  equivalent  devastation  in  the  U.S.,  tsunamis  have
hit  the  U.S.  in  recent  decades,  almost  all  of  them  generated  in  the  Pacific  Ocean.
To  protect  the  U.S.,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
(NOAA)  operates  two  tsunami  warning  centers,  one  in  Alaska  and  one  in  Hawaii.
The  Hawaiian  center  dates  back  to  1948,  and  the  entire  current  warning  system,
which includes ocean buoys, has been in place since 2001. In response to this recent
disaster,  on  January  14,  2005,  the  Administration  announced  an  interagency  plan
to  increase  U.S.  risk  assessment,  detection,  warning  and  disaster  planning  for
tsunamis. The plan would cost $37.5 million over two fiscal years.

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1) Which  regions  of  the  U.S.  and  the  rest  of  the  world  face  the  greatest  risk

from tsunamis?

2) What  are  the  best  methods  to  detect  tsunamis  and  provide  effective  warn-
ings?  What  are  the  best  methods  to  educate  the  U.S.  about  the  risks  of
tsunamis  and  how  to  be  prepared  for  them?  How  well  does  the  Administra-
tion’s new tsunami plan incorporate these methods?

3) What  should  the  U.S.  do  to  help  the  rest  of  the  world  better  prepare  for

tsunamis?

Administration’s National Weather Service.

Background:
What is a tsunami?

4

A  tsunami  is  a  series  of  ocean  waves  that  are  generated  by  a  violent  undersea
disturbance  or  activity,  usually  an  earthquake,  but  sometimes  a  volcanic  eruption,
landslide  or  even  a  meteor  impact.  These  events  cause  tsunamis  when  they  result
in the sudden displacement of a large volume of water. Earthquakes displace water
by  suddenly  raising  or  lowering  the  sea  floor;  in  the  case  of  the  recent  earthquake
the  Earth’s  crust  moved  at  least  an  inch  and  the  force  was  large  enough  to  affect
the  planet’s  rotation.  Waves  from  the  underwater  disruption  travel  out  of  the  area
of  origin  at  speeds  above  500  miles  per  hour  for  thousands  of  miles  (depending  on
the  depth  of  the  water).  The  waves  are  often  not  visible  on  the  water’s  surface  in
the  open  ocean,  but  when  the  waves  reach  shallower  coastal  shelves,  their  speed
slows and the waters pile up, gathering enormous force. Usually, it takes an earth-
quake  with  a  magnitude  above  7.5  on  the  Richter  scale  to  generate  a  tsunami  that
causes noticeable damage, and scientists are reluctant to predict that a tsunami has
been generated unless an earthquake measures at least 8.0.
Where do tsunamis occur most frequently and why?

Tsunamis  can  be  generated  in  any  of  the  world’s  oceans  or  inland  seas,  but  at
least  80  percent  of  all  tsunamis  occur  in  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Tsunamis  are  con-
centrated  in  the  Pacific  because  the  geology  of  the  Pacific  Rim  makes  it  the  area
on  Earth  most  susceptible  to  earthquakes  and  volcanic  eruptions,  earning  it  the
nickname  ‘‘Ring  of  Fire.’’  The  Earth’s  crust  is  not  a  single,  fixed  entity,  but  rather
is made up of large tectonic plates that slowly move about. Earthquakes and volca-
noes most often appear at the points where two or more plates abut each other. The
entire  Pacific  rim  is  lined  with  areas  in  which  plates  rub  up  against  each  other,  or
where  one  plate  dives  back  toward  the  Earth’s  core,  scraping  underneath  another
tectonic  plate.  The  most  active  areas  of  the  ‘‘Ring  of  Fire’’  include  the  coasts  off
Kamchatka,  Japan,  the  Kuril  Islands,  Alaska  and  South  America.  About  six  times
per century, on average, a tsunami from the ‘‘Ring of Fire’’ region sweeps across the
entire  Pacific,  is  reflected  from  distant  shores,  and  sets  the  entire  ocean  in  motion
for days.

Although  infrequent,  tsunamis  have  also  occurred  in  the  Atlantic  and  Indian
Oceans,  the  Mediterranean  Sea  and  even  within  smaller  bodies  of  water,  such  as
the Sea of Marmara, in Turkey. In the last decade alone, tsunamis that have caused
significant damage have occurred in Nicaragua (1992), Indonesia (1992, 1994, 1996),
Japan  (1993),  Philippines  (1994),  Mexico  (1995),  Peru  (1996,  2001),  Papua-New
Guinea (1998), Turkey (1999), and Vanuatu (1999).
Brief history of recent tsunamis that have hit the U.S.

In 1918, an earthquake in the Caribbean generated a wave that caused the deaths

of 40 people in the Virgin Islands.

In  1946,  an  earthquake  along  the  Aleutian  fault  (Alaska)  produced  waves  up  to
55  feet  high,  destroying  the  Hilo’s  waterfront  (Big  Island,  Hawaii).  The  tsunami
killed  159  people  and  caused  $255  million  (in  today’s  dollars)  in  damage.  In  re-
sponse to this event the Federal Government established the Pacific Tsunami Warn-
ing Center in Hawaii in 1948.

In  1957,  an  Alaskan  earthquake  produced  a  Pacific-wide  tsunami  causing  waves
of  75  feet  on  the  Alaska’s  Umnak  Island  and  waves  of  50  feet  on  Hawaii’s  Kauai
Island. No deaths occurred but damage was estimated at $34 million (in today’s dol-
lars).

In  1958,  an  earthquake  triggered  a  landslide  in  Lituya  Bay,  Alaska,  creating  a
tsunami  with  the  highest  waves  in  recorded  history  as  trees  were  stripped  to  a
height  of  1,720  feet.  However,  the  tsunami’s  energy  and  height  diminished  rapidly
away  from  the  source  area  and,  once  in  the  open  ocean,  the  tsunami  was  hardly
recorded by tide gauge stations.

In  1960,  a  magnitude  9.5  earthquake,  the  most  powerful  earthquake  in  the  20th
century, occurred off the coast of Chile. The resulting Pacific-wide tsunami reached
Hawaii  with  waves  as  high  as  35  feet,  causing  61  deaths  and  $155  million  (in  to-
day’s dollars) in damages.

In  1964,  a  magnitude  9.2  earthquake,  the  largest  earthquake  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  in  the  20th  century,  occurred  in  Alaska.  The  resulting  tsunami  dev-
astated five of Alaska’s seven largest communities and nearly destroyed the Alaskan
fishing  industry.  Waves  also  reached  the  entire  California  coastline  with  heights  of
seven to 21 feet. Half of the waterfront district in Crescent City, CA was destroyed.
The tsunami killed more than 120 people in the U.S. and Canada and caused a total
of $515 million in damage (in today’s dollars).

How does the U.S. Tsunami Warning System work?

5

The U.S. Tsunami Warning System is operated by the National Weather Service,
which  is  an  agency  of  NOAA.  There  are  two  Pacific  Warning  Centers:  an  Alaskan
center responsible for Alaska and the West Coast of the U.S., and a Hawaiian center
responsible  for  Hawaii  and  for  acting  as  the  national/international  warning  center
for  tsunamis  that  pose  a  Pacific-wide  threat.  The  Centers  are  part  of  an  inter-
national Pacific Tsunami Warning System, in which 26 nations participate.

The NOAA Centers are tasked with detecting, locating, and determining the mag-
nitude  of  earthquakes  occurring  in  the  Pacific  Basin  that  could  cause  a  tsunami.
Earthquake information is provided by seismic stations operated by NOAA, the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS), universities and other nations. NOAA also operates a se-
ries  of  six  Deep-ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART)  buoys  and
hundreds of coastal sea-level gauges in the Pacific Ocean. Since not all earthquakes
cause  tsunamis,  the  DART  buoys  are  critical  in  verifying  that  a  tsunami  has  been
generated. Before the DART buoys were deployed in 2001, more than half of all tsu-
nami  warnings  turned  out  to  be  false  alarms  in  that  either  no  tsunami  occurred  at
all or the one that was generated was not significant enough to cause any damage.
False alarms generate their own costs. For example, in 1986, an evacuation of Hono-
lulu that turned out to be a false alarm cost the State of Hawaii nearly $40 million.
Once  a  Center  has  determined  that  a  tsunami  has  been  generated,  the  Center
issues a tsunami warning that includes predicted arrival times for the waves at spe-
cific  coastal  communities.  These  warnings  are  submitted  to  federal,  State  and  local
emergency management officials, and the nations that take part in the Pacific Tsu-
nami  Warning  System,  which  are  responsible  for  relaying  the  information  to  the
public.

In  1996,  NOAA  (along  with  the  USGS,  the  Federal  Emergency  and  Management
Agency, and the States of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii) cre-
ated the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation program. The program is designed to
help  communities  prepare  for  tsunamis  by  giving  them  information  on  how  to  re-
spond  to  warnings,  helping  them  determine  exactly  what  is  most  at  risk  from
tsunamis  in  their  communities,  and  developing  strategies  to  mitigate  the  damage
that would occur from a tsunami. For example, the program funds mapping of coast-
al  communities  to  predict  which  areas  of  the  community  are  most  at  risk  from  the
tsunami.  These  maps  are  critical  for  proper  evacuation  and  community  prepared-
ness.  Public  education  is  also  a  crucial  element  of  the  program  because  tsunamis
can  come  ashore  within  minutes  of  nearby  earthquakes.  In  those  instances,  people
must know what to do immediately in the event of a ‘‘felt’’ earthquake in a low lying
coastal area.

The total budget for NOAA’s tsunami programs has risen from about $6.6 million

in Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 to $10.3 million in FY 2005.
What are TsunamiReady communities?

The  National  Weather  Service  has  developed  a  program  to  qualify  communities
as  being  ‘‘TsunamiReady.’’  Communities  must  meet  certain  criteria  such  as  having
established warning and emergency operations center staffed around the clock, hav-
ing  more  than  one  way  to  receive  tsunami  warnings  and  to  alert  the  public,  and
having  developed  a  formal  tsunami  plan  that  includes  emergency  evacuation  exer-
cises.  So  far,  only  15  communities  have  qualified  as  TsunamiReady.  Some  commu-
nities have complained that the program requirements are too rigorous and they do
not have the time or funding to fulfill them.
Why was the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center unable to warn the people of the

Indian Ocean Basin about the tsunami on December 26, 2004?

While  officials  at  the  U.S.  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  immediately  received
seismic  information  about  the  massive  earthquake  off  the  coast  of  Indonesia,  they
were  unable  to  determine  if  a  tsunami  had  been  generated  because  there  are  no
DART  buoys  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  In  addition,  the  Center  initially  thought  the
earthquake  was  of  a  lesser  magnitude.  However,  within  15  minutes,  the  Center
issued a bulletin to the 26 nations of the Pacific Region stating that there was mini-
mal  risk  to  the  Pacific  Ocean  Basin  counties.  NOAA  officials  did  not  know  of  the
actual existence of the tsunami until two and a half hours later when news reports
began appearing from Sri Lanka. Also, unlike in the Pacific, no international warn-
ing  system  has  been  put  together  to  disseminate  information  about  events  in  the
Indian  Ocean  Basin.  However,  NOAA  officials  did  contact  the  State  Department  to
see  if  it  could  distribute  information.  Unfortunately,  the  State  Department  was  not
called  until  seven  hours  after  the  earthquake,  but  that  still  may  have  been  enough
time to warn communities on the East coast of Africa.

Recent Developments:

On  January  14,  2005,  the  Administration  announced  a  new  $37.5  million  plan  to
improve  tsunami  detection,  warning,  and  community  preparedness  for  the  U.S.
Under  the  plan,  NOAA  would  receive  $14.5  million  in  an  Emergency  Supplemental
Appropriation  in  the  current  fiscal  year  and  $9.5  million  in  the  proposed  FY  2006
budget,  which  is  due  to  be  released  February  7,  2005.  The  money  would  be  used
to  purchase  and  deploy  32  DART  buoys  and  38  new  tide  gauges  around  the  U.S.
and its territories. That equipment would provide additional coverage in the Pacific
and  initiate  coverage  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  and  the  Caribbean.  NOAA  would  also
expand  its  education  and  outreach  efforts,  develop  tsunami  inundation  maps  for
more  coastal  communities,  and  enhance  tsunami  warning  distribution  through  new
hardware  and  software.  The  USGS  would  receive  $8.1  million  in  the  Emergency
Supplemental  Appropriation  and  $5.4  million  in  the  FY  2006  budget  to  improve
seismic monitoring and information delivery from the Global Seismic Network. More
information about the plan can be found at www.noaanews.noaa.gov.

On January 18, 2005, the United Nations hosted a conference on natural disasters
in  Kobe,  Japan  to  coincide  with  the  10th  anniversary  of  the  earthquake  that  rav-
aged  that  city.  While  the  discussion  was  to  be  about  preventing  natural  disasters
in general, the issues surrounding the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami domi-
nated  the  conference.  Many  nations  called  for  the  immediate  creation  of  an  Indian
Ocean  tsunami  warning  system,  but  it  was  unclear  what  specific  actions  would  be
taken.

Much  of  the  discussion  was  about  how  to  better  educate  the  public  about
tsunamis. While the technology exists to cover the Indian Ocean and the world with
buoys  and  sensors,  experts  warn  that  many  of  the  areas  hit  by  the  recent  tsunami
suffer  from  deep  poverty  and  lack  basic  education  and  communication  networks,
making  it  difficult  to  deliver  warnings  and  promote  the  proper  response.  Delegates
from  Japan,  which  has  the  most  sophisticated  tsunami  warning  system,  said  they
still have great difficulty in educating the Japanese public about the destructive na-
ture of tsunamis and what to do if they feel an earthquake near the shore.

The  Administration  has  said  that  its  new  tsunami  warning  plan  for  the  U.S.
should  be  part  of  a  global  Earth  observing  system  and  is  working  with  54  other
countries on what that system should entail.
Issues:
1) The  Administration’s  new  improved  tsunami  warning  plan  proposes  $15  million
in  new  activities  for  NOAA  and  USGS  in  FY06.  Given  the  current  fiscal  con-
straints on all federal agencies, the Committee wants to better understand what
programs or functions of NOAA and USGS may have to be reduced or eliminated
to pay for these new activities.

2) NOAA  has  six  special  tsunami  detection  (DART)  buoys  deployed  in  the  Pacific
Ocean. However, only three of the six DART buoys are currently operational. The
Administration’s  proposal  is  for  NOAA  to  operate  a  total  of  38  buoys  in  the  Pa-
cific, Atlantic and Caribbean by mid-2007. Why is 50 percent of the current sys-
tem not functioning and what is NOAA doing about it? What will be the greatest
challenges in operating 38 buoys and how will NOAA overcome these challenges?
3) Most of the proposed $37.5 million in the Administration’s tsunami warning pro-
posal  is  for  new  buoys  and  seismic  equipment.  While  new  technology  and  detec-
tion  systems  are  important,  many  experts  believe  that  local  education  and  plan-
ning  may  be  at  least  as  important  and  more  difficult  to  execute.  What  specific
activities  does  the  Administration  propose  to  increase  local  education  and  plan-
ning and is the current proposal too heavily weighed toward technology?

4) Natural disasters occurring along the world’s coastlines are causing significantly
more damage and deaths. This is caused by the tremendous growth in population
and developmental of coastal areas and not by an increased number or intensity
of  disasters.  Should  we  spend  some  of  our  limited  resources  on  reevaluating  our
land-use policies?

Witness Questions:

In  their  letters  of  invitation,  the  witnesses  were  asked  to  address  the  following

questions in their testimony:
Dr. Charles ‘‘Chip’’ Groat, Director of the United States Geological Survey.

Which regions of the U.S. are tsunamis most likely to affect? What are the pos-
sible  causes  of  tsunamis  forming  in  the  Atlantic  or  Caribbean  basins  and  what
are the likelihoods that they could form there?

Chairman BOEHLERT. The hearing will come to order.
The  first  order  of  business  is  to  introduce  to  the  audience  and
our  colleagues  on  our  committee,  the  veterans,  some  of  the  newer
Members of the Committee. It is my understanding that the Demo-
crats  have  just  organized,  and  the  Committee  assignments  were
just  made  available  late  yesterday,  so  some  of  the  newer  Members
may not know of their assignment just yet.

But  on  the  Republican  side,  we  are  pleased  to  welcome  Dave
Reichert  from  Washington  State,  Mike  Sodrel  from  Indiana,  Mi-
chael McCaul from Texas, and Joe Schwarz, who will be joining us
shortly from Michigan.

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  today,  especially  our  freshmen
Members. This is our first Science Committee hearing of the 109th
Congress, and also the first Congressional hearing on the Adminis-
tration’s proposals for limiting U.S. vulnerability to tsunami.

It is unfortunate that it took a tragedy of staggering proportions
to thrust this issue to the top of the Congressional agenda, and in-
deed the whole world’s agenda. But this newfound attention should
help prevent future deaths.

And  that  is  the  goal  of  today’s  hearing:  to  determine  how  the
U.S. can best prevent future deaths, both at home and abroad. The
Administration is to be applauded for coming forward quickly with
a  cogent,  targeted,  and  affordable  proposal  to  improve  tsunami  de-
tection for the U.S. and for its commitment to improve tsunami de-
tection internationally.

But  detection  is  only  one  piece  of  the  kind  of  the  comprehensive
effort  that  is  needed  to  reduce  vulnerability  to  tsunami.  Warning
systems,  education,  research  and  development,  land-use  planning,
and  ecosystem  protection  are  all  necessary  if  any  program  is  to  be
effective. The Administration acknowledges this, but Congress now
needs to evaluate whether the January 14 proposal strikes the ap-
propriate  balance  among  those  elements.  Shiny  new  technologies
should not blind us to the need for a comprehensive approach.

Today’s  hearing  must  also  address  a  number  of  other  questions
to  help  us  develop  a  policy.  How  much  risk  does  the  U.S.  actually
face from tsunami, and how much would the proposed program re-
duce  that  risk?  To  what  extent  would  the  proposed  program  help
save  lives  and  property  from  a  tsunami  that  was  generated  right
off shore? Will other programs be cut in the President’s fiscal year
2006  budget  to  pay  for  this  new  proposal?  What,  precisely,  is  the
U.S. prepared to do to reduce the vulnerability to tsunami in other
parts  of  the  world?  How  can  we  best  integrate  the  tsunami  pro-
gram  with  other  hazard  mitigation  and  research  programs?  A  lot
of questions there, and that is why we are having this timely hear-
ing to get some answers.

This committee has long experience in putting together efforts to
improve  the  U.S.  response  to  natural  disasters.  The  National
Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction  Program,  or  NEHRP,  as  we  affec-
tionately  call  it,  which  we  created  in  1977,  has  helped  reduce  the
loss  of  life  and  property  from  earthquakes,  and  indeed,  NEHRP  is
an  essential  part  of  U.S.  efforts  to  prepare  for  tsunami,  because
most  tsunami  are  generated  by  earthquakes.  We  just  reauthorized
NEHRP last year and also created a similar program to respond to
windstorms.

10

A  lesson  I  draw  from  many  years  of  experience  with  NEHRP  is
that any successful response program requires a comprehensive ap-
proach,  strong  interagency  coordination,  and  an  unswerving  focus
to ensure that all programs’ work will truly reduce the destruction
wreaked by future events.

Another  lesson  I  take  is  the  centrality  of  the  National  Science
Foundation  to  any  successful  effort.  I  think  all  of  our  witnesses
today mention NSF in their prepared testimony, and I hope the key
role  of  NSF  will  be  reflected  in  the  Administration’s  fiscal  year
2006 budget request.

I  think  today’s  hearing  will  make  it  clear  just  how  complex  the
science behind our understanding of tsunami is. I can certainly say
that  I  learned  a  lot  of  new  vocabulary  reading  this  testimony,  as
well  as  discovering  that  the  plural  of  ‘‘tsunami’’  is  ‘‘tsunami.’’  But
I want to make sure today that we don’t get lost in the complexity
and keep a steady eye on our goal, which is saving lives.

The devastating events of December 26 are a wake-up call to all
of  us  that  we  need  to  do  more  to  prepare  for  tsunami.  But  it  can’t
be  the  kind  of  wake-up  call  that  leaves  us  panicked  and  dis-
oriented. It cannot be a wake-up call that leads us to race to work
only  to  find  later  that  we  are  wearing  mismatched  socks  and  have
forgotten  our  belts.  We  need  to  take  the  time  now,  starting  with
this  hearing,  and  guided  by  the  Administration’s  proposal,  to  put
in  place  a  broad,  thoughtful,  and  sustainable  program  that  can
save lives here and around the world.

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  today,  especially  our  freshman  Members.  This

would  the  proposed  program  reduce  that  risk?  To  what  extent  would  the  proposed

nerability  to  tsunamis  in  other  parts  of  the  world?  How  can  we  best  integrate  the
tsunami program with other hazard mitigation and research programs?

tainable program that can save lives here and around the world.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  Chair  now  is  pleased  to  recognize  the

Ranking Member from Tennessee, Mr. Gordon.

Mr.  GORDON.  Good  morning.  As  usual,  I  concur  with  Chairman
Boehlert’s  opening  statement,  and  I  want  to  thank  him  for  calling
this important hearing.

As  Sherry  pointed  out,  our  Caucus  did  not  make  appointments
until  just  yesterday  evening,  so  a  lot  of  our  new  Members  aren’t
here,  so  I  am  going  to  wait  until  a  later  time  to  introduce  them.
And I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate our Chair-
man for surviving both a difficult operation and re-election, and we
are glad to see you back with us. And to the new Republican Mem-
bers,  I  suspect  that  you  all  went  through  pretty  difficult  elections
and partisan, and I hope that you can think of this as a mostly par-
tisan-free  zone  now,  and  can  concentrate  on  substance  and  leave
the politics back home. So that is what we try to do here.

But  the  tsunami  that  struck  seven  nations  in  the  Indian  Ocean
one  month  ago  shocked  the  world  with  their  awesome  destructive
power.  We  can  not  recover  the  lost  lives,  but  we  can  ensure  that
we are well prepared to deal with the natural disasters here in the
United  States,  and  we  help—and  that  we  can  help  other  nations
to do a better job preparing as well.

Tsunamis  are  rare  events,  but  large  ones  can  have  devastating
impacts  when  they  occur.  Compared  to  the  cost  in  life  and  prop-
erty, the cost of a tsunami warning and emergency preparation sys-
tem  is  very  small.  The  Administration’s  Tsunami  Warning  System
improvement  plan  provides  $37.5  million  to  NOAA  and  the  USGS
over the next two years to upgrade the Pacific Warning System and
deploy  a  detection  system  in  the  Atlantic  and  Caribbean  Basins.
The  plan  provides  the  basis  to  cover  the  coastal  U.S.,  and  it  is  a
good start.

However,  I  am  concerned  that  once  the  headlines  have  dis-
appeared and the memories of the recent tragedy have dimmed, we
may  have  deployed  a  network  without  sufficient  funds  to  sustain
its  operational  capacities.  The  current  network  in  the  Pacific  has
six buoys, but three are not operational. Clearly, maintenance is an
issue  that  we  need  to  consider.  I  also  believe  we  need  sufficient
sustained  support  for  central  public  education  and  State  and  local

12

emergency  preparation  programs  that  translate  detection  and
warning systems into life-saving actions.

Most of the funding in the current proposal is devoted to the pro-
curement  and  deployment  of  technology.  Mr.  Wilson  of  the  Oregon
Emergency  Management  is  recommending  sustained  annual  fund-
ing  of  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  of  $7.8
million.  We  currently  spend  $4  million.  The  Administration’s  pro-
posal includes an additional $5 million over two years. That is $2.6
million less than Mr. Wilson recommends. So the $37.5 million over
two years included in the Administration’s proposal is a good start,
but it does not appear to be a complete proposal.

And from where does the money come? If we are spending money
to upgrade and expand the Tsunami Warning System, are we going
to pay for it in reductions to other programs, and if so, which ones?
These  are  other—there  are  other  programs  at  NOAA  that  are  es-
sential  to  preserve  lives  and  property.  Is  the  Tsunami  Warning
System going to come at the expense of nationwide implementation
of  improved  flood-forecasting  models?  Will  funding  for  research  to
improve tornado and hurricane forecasts be cut? Severe storms and
the flooding associated with them occur every year. The forecasting
and warning systems for these natural disasters also need to be up-
graded and maintained.

So  as  we  design  and  employ  this  Tsunami  Warning  System,  we
must provide sustainable funding to ensure its continued operation.
But  we  should  not  sacrifice  other  equally  important  NOAA  pro-
grams and operations in an effort to develop a temporary response
to  yesterday’s  crisis.  If  we  are  going  to  do  this,  we  should  do  it
right, and doing it right requires that we know the full initial and
annual  cost  needed  to  deliver  the  benefits  the  public  expects  from
this warning system.

We  have  an  excellent  witness  panel  today.  I  welcome  all  of  our
witnesses  to  Washington  and  thank  you  for  appearing  before  the
Committee  this  morning.  And  I  certainly  want  to  welcome  our  col-
league,  Jay  Inslee,  for  being  here  with  us.  I  look  forward  to  your
testimony  and  to  hearing  your  thoughts  on  how  we  can  best  ad-
dress  the  development  and  the  end-to-end  emergency  warning  and
response system for tsunamis.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Good  Morning.  I  thank  Chairman  Boehlert  for  convening  this  important  hearing.
The  tsunamis  that  struck  seven  nations  in  the  Indian  Ocean  one  month  ago
shocked  the  world  with  their  awesome,  destructive  power.  We  cannot  recover  the
lost  lives,  but  we  can  ensure  that  we  are  well-prepared  to  deal  with  natural  disas-
ters  here  in  the  U.S.  And  we  can  help  other  nations  to  be  better  prepared  as  well.
Tsunamis are rare events, but large ones can have devastating impacts when they
occur. Compared to the cost in life and property, the cost of a tsunami warning and
emergency preparation systems is small.

The  Administration’s  tsunami  warning  system  improvement  plan  provides  $37.5
million  dollars  to  NOAA  and  USGS  over  the  next  two  years  to  upgrade  the  Pacific
warning  system  and  deploy  a  detection  system  in  the  Atlantic  and  Caribbean  ba-
sins. The plan provides the basics to cover the coastal U.S. It is a good start.

However,  I  am  concerned  that  once  the  headlines  have  disappeared  and  the
memories  of  the  recent  tragedy  have  dimmed  we  may  have  a  deployed  network
without sufficient funds to sustain its operational capabilities. The current network

in  the  Pacific  has  six  buoys,  but  three  are  not  operating.  Clearly,  maintenance  is
an issue we need to consider.

I  also  believe  we  need  sufficient  sustained  support  for  the  essential  public  edu-
cation  and  State  and  local  emergency  preparedness  programs  that  translate  detec-
tion  and  warning  into  life-saving  actions.  Most  of  the  funding  in  the  current  pro-
posal is devoted to the procurement and deployment of technology.

Mr. Wilson of Oregon Emergency Management is recommending sustained annual
funding  for  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  of  $7.8  million  dol-
lars.  We  currently  spend  about  $4  million.  The  Administration’s  proposal  includes
an  additional  $5  million  over  two  years—$2.6  million  less  than  Mr.  Wilson’s  rec-
ommendation. So, the $37.5 million over two years included in the Administration’s
proposal is a good start, but does not appear to be a complete proposal.

And  where  will  the  money  come  from?  It  is  no  secret  that  we  are  in  a  terrible
budget  situation.  If  we  are  spending  money  to  upgrade  and  expand  the  tsunami
warning  system,  are  we  going  to  pay  for  it  with  reductions  to  other  programs?  If
so, which ones?

There are other programs at NOAA that are essential to preserve lives and prop-
erty. Is the tsunami warning system going to come at the expense of nationwide im-
plementation of improved flood forecasting models? Will funding for research to im-
prove tornado and hurricane forecasting be cut? Severe storms and the flooding as-
sociated with them occur every year. The forecasting and warning systems for these
natural disasters also need to be upgraded and maintained.

As we design and deploy this tsunami warning system, we must provide sustain-
able  funding  to  ensure  its  continued  operation.  But  we  should  not  sacrifice  other
equally  important  NOAA  programs  and  operations  in  an  effort  to  develop  a  tem-
porary  response  to  yesterday’s  crisis.  If  we  are  going  to  do  this,  we  should  do  it
right. Doing it right requires that we know the full initial and annual costs needed
to deliver the benefits the public expects from this warning system.

We  have  an  excellent  witness  panel.  I  welcome  all  of  you  to  Washington  and
thank you for appearing before the Committee this morning. I look forward to your
testimony  and  to  hearing  your  thoughts  on  how  we  can  best  address  the  develop-
ment of an end-to-end emergency warning and response system for tsunamis.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And  it  is  with  mixed  emotions  that  I  make  this  next  announce-
ment, but today is the last official hearing for Martha ‘‘Marty’’ Ral-
ston, who is retiring at the end of this week after 26 years of dedi-
cated  service  to  this  committee.  And  she  typifies  the  profes-
sionalism  and  dedication  and  commitment  of  the  staff  of  this  com-
mittee.  And  I  would  ask  you  to  join  me  in  saluting  her  for  that
service.

Our  first  witness  on  panel  one,  and  our  only  witness  on  panel
one, is our distinguished colleague, Jay Inslee. Jay is someone who
is,  I  have  learned  from  long  experience,  very  knowledgeable  about
the  subject  matter  that  he  involves  himself  in,  and  it  is  a  wide
range  of  activities.  So  to  my  colleague,  I  say  welcome  and  we  look
forward to hearing from you on this very important subject.

How  are  we  doing  there?  Here  we  go.  High  technology  at  work.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

A month ago today one of the most devastating tsunamis ever recorded struck the
nations  of  the  Indian  Ocean  Basin.  My  prayers  continue  to  go  out  to  the  victims
of this terrible event. It is a startling reminder of our vulnerability to natural disas-
ters.  As  people  recover  from  the  shock  of  the  tsunami,  we  naturally  begin  to  ask
the  questions  such  as  ‘‘What  can  we  learn  from  this  to  prevent  future  disasters?’’
In that vein, I am pleased that Chairman Boehlert organized today’s hearing about
the  state  of  preparedness  for  detecting  and  responding  to  tsunamis  in  the  United
States.

As Chairman of the Environment, Technology, and Standards Subcommittee, I am
particularly  interested  in  the  role  that  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration’s  (NOAA)  National  Weather  Service  plays  in  tsunami  detection  and
warning systems. Currently, NOAA operates a tsunami warning system for the Pa-
cific Ocean. Recently, the Administration announced an interagency plan to increase

U.S. risk assessment, detection, warning, and disaster planning for tsunamis. Under
the plan, NOAA would expand its current system nationwide using emergency sup-
plemental  appropriations  in  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2005  of  $14.5  million  and  then  $9.5
million  in  FY  2006.  While  I  support  the  Administration’s  plan  to  expand  our  tsu-
nami  detection  systems,  I  am  concerned  about  adequate  funding  in  the  out  years
for  maintenance  of  the  system.  Currently  only  three  of  the  six  deep-ocean  buoys
used to detect tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean are working.

Advanced  tsunami  detection  buoys  and  real-time  warning  systems  will  only  take
us  so  far.  People  in  coastal  areas,  and  those  visiting  coastal  areas,  must  learn  to
recognize  the  signs  of  natural  disasters  like  tsunamis  and  must  know  how  to  re-
spond  appropriately  to  warnings.  One  of  the  news  reports  from  the  Indian  Ocean
tsunami  was  about  a  young  school  girl  who  had  just  learned  about  tsunamis  in
class. On vacation with her family, she recognized that the unusually large amount
of water receding from the beach was a sign that a tsunami was coming and warned
those near by to flee to higher ground. Her efforts saved dozens of lives. We should
all know basic signs of natural disasters like this. This is a perfect example of why
we must continue to work for improved science education in all of our schools.

Unfortunately,  it  has  taken  this  tragic  event  to  bring  natural  disaster  response
planning  to  our  attention  today.  However,  now  that  the  opportunity  is  upon  us  we
must act quickly to establish a detection and warning system for the United States,
and  collaborate  intensely  on  an  international  system.  Not  only  must  we  develop  an
excellent  worldwide  detection  system,  but  must  also  do  the  harder  task  of  imple-
menting a good warning system and training the public to understand and heed the
warnings.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gilchrest follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE WAYNE T. GILCHREST

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  address  the  tragedy  of  the  recent  Indian  Ocean
Tsunami and the opportunity it presents to examine and address our pressing need
to better understand our oceans.

Comprising  70  percent  of  the  Earth’s  surface  area,  our  oceans  support  a  growing
source of protein for many developing countries, promising sources of medicines, and
efficient  transport  of  goods  between  continents  and  among  nations.  They  also
strongly influence our climate and weather and provide economic and unmeasurable
quality of life benefits. For proof of this, one only needs to know that the U.S. coasts
support over 50 percent of the U.S. population and comprise only 17 percent of our
land base.

When  South  Asia  was  struck  by  tsunami  waves  on  December  26,  the  world’s  in-
terest  in  tsunami  detection  and  warning  systems  was  heightened.  The  impact  of
these  waves  was  felt  around  the  world,  and  the  tragedy  of  its  immediate  effect  on
Indian  Ocean  coastlines  has  painfully  exposed  our  lack  of  ability  to  provide  early
warning  and  coastal  community  education  and  support.  Many  lifelong  residents  of
Indian Ocean coastal towns fear the sea—the primary source of their livelihoods for
generations. It is critical that individuals in high-risk areas are educated about and
prepared for tsunamis before they strike. Coastal communities need assurance that
technology  exists  and  will  be  applied  to  increase  warnings  for  such  events  and  to
prepare them for evacuation to avoid catastrophic loss of human life.

In  contrast,  developed  nations  use  increasing  technological  sophistication  to  ac-
quire  from  the  sea  its  bounty—with  little  thought  for  the  long-term  sustainability
of  this  activity.  In  time,  without  increased  understanding  of  our  ocean  ecosystems
and the impact of our harvest and extraction of its resources, developed nations may
also come to fear the sea. The antidote to the disease of fear is understanding. New
technologies  have  already  led  to  enormous  advances  in  our  understanding  of  the
coastal  and  marine  environment.  However,  advanced  sensors  have  been  deployed
only  on  relatively  small  scales,  and  the  systems  that  are  deployed  have  not  been
coordinated  into  an  integrated  system  that  will  optimize  our  understanding  of  the
oceans.

Since the U.S. hosted the Earth Observation Summit in July 2003, we have been
working  with  our  partner  nations  to  adopt  a  comprehensive,  coordinated  and  sus-
tained  Earth  Observation  System  to  collect  and  disseminate  data,  information  and
models  for  more  effective  and  responsible  use  of  our  resources  as  well  as  to  inform
decision-makers  about  impending  disasters.  Most  recently,  the  U.S.  Commission  on
Ocean  Policy  made  an  integrated  ocean  observing  system  a  top  recommendation  in
its report, An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century.

Our  space  exploration  and  our  weather  programs  show  that  when  our  scientists
and  the  Nation  support  a  program  and  devote  time,  money  and  most  importantly

the human mind into these types of endeavors we are highly successful. The ocean,
however,  is  often  referred  to  as  the  last  frontier,  a  place  where  we  continue  to  find
new organisms and species and where we still struggle to understand the profound
implications  for  climate  changes  and  more  direct  impacts  of  the  oceans  on  our
human habitats.

There  is  perhaps  no  more  motivating  event,  no  louder  a  voice  for  attention  and
understanding  than  having  the  ocean  engulf  human  habitats.  Our  failure  to  fully
develop  and  utilize  our  technology  to  understand  our  oceans  has  many  more  impli-
cations,  including  the  potential  for  permanent  damage  to  fragile  and  complex  eco-
systems  that  have  generously  provided  us  with  food,  medicines,  recreation,  and
other benefits. We are now awake to the power of the ocean, and it is my hope that
we will use this opportunity to move more quickly toward integrated data collection
and  dissemination  systems,  as  well  as  intensive  education  of  coastal  communities,
to  ensure  that  we  and  future  generations  can  look  to  the  sea  for  inspiration,  suste-
nance, and life-giving support.

I applaud the Administration’s commitment to increase global monitoring capacity
and  public  awareness  about  tsunamis  and  other  disasters,  especially  in  adding  ca-
pacity  to  ocean  monitoring  as  part  of  the  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Sys-
tems  (GEOSS).  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  from  our  esteemed  witnesses  and
their insight into how best to develop our contribution to GEOSS to best warn coast-
al  communities  of  potential  disasters,  how  to  integrate  this  system  with  broader
needs for integrated ocean monitoring data, and how best to educate coastal commu-
nities about the impacts of the oceans on our lives.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  discuss  the  causes  of  tsunamis,  the  risks  they  may  pose  to  the  U.S.  and  to  the
rest  of  the  world,  and  how  the  U.S.  should  prepare  for  them.  We  have  all  shared
the  grief  and  recognized  the  catastrophic  damage  caused  by  the  tsunami  in  South
Asia.  While  Americans  have  generously  responded  to  the  disaster,  we  also  have  an
important role to play in preventing such horrific loss of life should another under-
water earthquake occur.

A  tsunami  as  powerful  as  the  one  that  devastated  South  and  Southeast  Asia  has
never  hit  the  United  States,  but  that  does  not  mean  it  could  not  happen.  Even  a
lesser  catastrophe  could  be  deadly,  and  would  only  take  a  minor  underwater  land-
slide  in  the  Canary  Islands  to  trigger  a  big  eruption.  The  Atlantic  Ocean,  like  the
Indian  Ocean,  lacks  tsunami  sensors.  There  were  no  sensors  in  the  Indian  Ocean
because tsunamis were deemed less likely there, but now we know that ‘less likely’
is not good enough. Merely detecting a disaster and having the technology to access
the magnitude of the earthquake will not minimize the impact of future natural dis-
asters.  Experts  believe  that  millions  of  lives  lost  in  the  recent  tsunami  disaster
could  have  been  saved  if  the  Indian  Ocean  countries  had  the  capabilities  to  admin-
ister  warnings  about  the  impending  catastrophe  to  people  along  the  coasts.  This
claim  has  caused  us  to  re-examine  our  own  risk  assessment  and  detection  systems
for tsunamis and I am pleased this committee is having this hearing today in order
to address the challenges that lie ahead.

I welcome our panel of witnesses and look forward to their testimony.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  Chairman  Boehlert  for  calling  this  important
hearing  to  review  how  prepared  the  U.S.  is  for  tsunamis.  I  also  want  to  thank  our
distinguished witnesses for agreeing to appear today and answer our questions.

We  were  all  quite  disturbed  by  the  catastrophic  images  that  were  disseminated
worldwide  last  December.  As  casualties  have  risen  above  the  200,000,  our  hearts
and prayers go out to all the victims and their families.

As  we  discuss  the  enormous  devastation  caused  by  this  natural  disaster,  the  one

question we must ask ourselves is could this have been avoided?

We  here  in  the  U.S.  at  least  like  to  believe  that  thanks  to  the  sophisticated  tsu-
nami-detection systems in the Pacific Ocean, we are save from tsunami harm. How-
ever, recent reports have suggested that half of our system is in desperate need re-
pair, leaving substantial blind spots in our detection system and our beaches vulner-
able.

This is unacceptable. The nations around the Pacific Ocean basin have had a tsu-
nami-warning  network  in  place  since  the  1940s.  Since  the  mid  ’90s,  the  U.S.  has
had sensors at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean floor capable of detecting destructive
waves and signaling to surface buoys, which then radio the information to satellites
and  onward  to  scientists.  No  such  Indian  Ocean  tsunami-warning  system  was  in
place.

Equally  as  important  as  increasing  technology,  there  should  also  be  an  increase
in  education.  There  was  little  public  education  in  low-income  countries  to  the  dan-
gers  of  tsunamis.  The  public  needs  to  understand  and  react  properly  to  tsunami
warning  signs,  such  as  the  rattling  of  an  earthquake  that  initiates  the  wave,  the
dramatic  recession  of  water  from  the  beaches,  and  a  deep  rumbling  that  imme-
diately  precedes  the  wave.  Information  needs  to  get  from  federal  to  State  and  local
agencies—and then be transmitted to the public. Most importantly, the public needs
to understand what to do with that information.

I  hope  the  witnesses  here  today  can  help  us  come  up  with  ideas  on  how  exactly

With that being said, I again thank the Chair and Ranking Member for this hear-

to accomplish this.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Davis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE LINCOLN DAVIS

Good  morning.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member,  for  the  oppor-
tunity  for  us  to  discuss  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  that  occurred  on  December  26,
2004. Thank you, Witnesses, for your presence today.

It is hard to imagine the destruction caused by that tsunami. My district, in rural

Tennessee, seems so far removed from a natural disaster such as this one.

But my constituents, whose loved ones are bravely serving this nation in our mili-
tary,  know  the  feelings  of  sorrow  and  despair  when  lives  are  lost.  Tornadoes  and
floods affect our area, and so I can understand the grave importance of having plans
in  place  to  predict  these  forces  of  nature  so  that  people  can  prepare  as  best  they
can.

I  have  seen  much  on  the  news  about  the  December  26th  Tsunami—we  all  have.
But  it  is  my  hope  today  that  these  witnesses  who  are  experts  in  their  fields  will
be  able  to  tell  us  what  we  can  do  in  the  future  to  better  prepare,  better  predict,
better communicate, and better protect people from future tsunamis.

It  is  frustrating  to  know  that  all  the  world’s  advanced  technologies  couldn’t  save
212,000  people.  212,000  of  anything  is  hard  to  fathom,  and  the  loss  of  just  one  life
seems  unbearable.  Our  hearts  and  prayers  go  to  the  families  of  those  affected  by
this terrible disaster.

Mr. Chairman, thank you and I yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Mr. Chairman,

I  want  to  thank  you  for  organizing  this  briefing  on  how  NOAA,  USGS,  univer-
sities, and State agencies can assist with the detection and relief efforts of tsunamis
and  other  natural  disasters.  Just  last  week  I  traveled  with  my  Congressional  col-
leagues  to  Colombo  and  Galle  in  Sri  Lanka  on  a  delegation  lead  by  Congressman
Joseph  Crowley.  I  saw  the  devastation  caused  by  the  December  26  tsunami  which
took thousands of lives. I have never witnessed such extensive destruction and loss
of life. I hope that the technologies that the Science Committee will help to develop
will help to minimized losses in future natural disasters.

I was able to see first hand how USAID workers and U.S. Armed Forces personnel
were helping in the effort to provide assistance and rebuild. Despite all the horrific
devastation,  it  was  a  welcome  sight  to  see  American  personnel  putting  so  much
work and effort into helping the people struck by the tsunami. You could see on the
faces of the Sri Lankan people that they were grateful of the efforts being made on
their behalf. Those Americans in Galle have served their nation well and we should
all be proud of their efforts.
Tsunami Causes and History

Tsunamis are walls of water that inundate coastal areas with little or no warning,
often  taking  many  lives  and  causing  extensive  property  damage.  They  are  initiated
by  sudden  underwater  disruptions  and  in  this  regard  they  differ  from  wind  gen-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:17 Jun 20, 2005 Jkt 098395 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\012605\98395 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

17

erated  waves  because  the  power  they  pack  is  not  limited  to  the  surface.  Tsunamis
are usually started as a result of an undersea earthquake, which for years was con-
sidered to be the sole cause of tsunamis. Research is now showing that tsunami gen-
eration  involves  intricate  interactions  between  earthquakes,  undersea  landslides,
and sympathetic vibrations between the quake and the ocean above it.

Tsunamis  have  been  known  since  426  B.C.,  and  between  1990  and  2001  there
were  11  major  tsunami  events  in  the  Pacific  Rim,  killing  over  4,000  people  and
causing  hundreds  of  millions  in  property  damage.  Previously,  the  most  devastating
tsunami  occurred  in  1755  in  the  Atlantic  which  killed  60,000  people  and  destroyed
much of Lisbon. By comparison, the death toll from the Banda Aceh Tsunami could
exceed  150,000  on  top  of  the  unthinkable  numbers  of  displaced,  orphaned,  and  in-
jured. Subsequent disease and untreated injuries will undoubtedly add to these sta-
tistics.
U.S. Assistance

The  President  has  already  pledged  $350  million  in  direct  support  to  the  affected
countries  on  top  of  the  medical,  infrastructure,  and  logistics  support  from  the  U.S.
Military.  I  want  to  encourage  my  colleagues  in  the  Congress  to  work  together  as
we  did  last  Fall  to  provide  nearly  $14  billion  in  relief  to  the  Southeastern  states
and Caribbean nations following the four devastating hurricanes.

In addition to the technical assistance our U.S. Military is providing for the relief
efforts,  we  want  to  also  make  sure  that  U.S.  scientific  capability  is  available  to  the
relief efforts and also in the prediction and warning of future natural disasters.

I  also  want  to  recognize  the  private  sector  that  has  shown  unprecedented  out-
pouring  of  generosity  with  donations  of  supplies  and  money.  In  my  own  district,  I
helped to organize a group known as Houston’s Solutions for Tsunami Victims held
a  Medical  Relief  Drive  and  Save  the  Children  Effort  in  Houston  on  January  9th  in
which  thousands  of  vital  medical  supplies  were  collected  and  will  be  delivered  to
tsunami stricken areas.
Research and Early Warning

Beyond the immediate needs, I want to encourage the Science Committee to work
with me in developing programs that will help to minimize losses suffered in future
natural disasters. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and
the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  lead  the  U.S.  in  the  research,  monitoring,  and  warning
of  tsunamis  and  other  natural  disasters.  For  example,  the  Deep-ocean  Assessment
and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  Project  (DART)  can  detect  ocean  level  anomalies  as
small as  c  inch in 20,000 feet of water to determine if a tsunami event is occurring
in  the  deep  sea.  This  system  was  useful  in  avoiding  a  false  alarm  in  response  to
an  Alaskan  earthquake  that  could  have  but,  did  not  cause  a  tsunami.  DART  sta-
tions  cost  about  $250,000  to  purchase  and  around  $125,000  per  year  to  maintain.
Stations  are  now  located  off  the  coasts  of  Alaska,  the  Pacific  Northwest,  and  Chile,
but  we  need  to  consider  how  this  system  can  be  expanded  to  other  parts  of  the
world. Reliability of the DART system needs to be understood as we consider its de-
ployment worldwide.

Research  on  the  causes  of  tsunamis  is  also  needed.  One  of  the  most  severe
tsunamis  in  recent  history  occurred  in  Papua  New  Guinea  in  July  1998.  The  initi-
ating  earthquake  was  unexceptional  at  a  magnitude  of  7.1—the  size  of  an  earth-
quake  that  strikes  somewhere  in  the  world  about  every  three  weeks.  Geological
modeling strongly suggested that the quake caused an underwater landslide that to-
gether triggered the exceptional size tsunami that killed at least 2,500 people. Other
preliminary research indicates that under some conditions, tsunamis may be detect-
able  from  aircraft  or  satellites  using  radar  or  radiometers  miles  away  from  coastal
areas.

NASA  recently  provided  me  with  some  preliminary  information  that  their
JASON–1  satellite  sensors  did  detect  the  December  26  tsunami,  and  I  understand
that  NASA  is  already  collaborating  with  NOAA  in  the  analysis  of  this  data.  While
JASON–1  was  not  designed  as  part  of  a  tsunami  warning  system,  these  data  may
help  to  identify  new  sensor  and  detection  systems  for  tsunamis  that  will  reliably
predict tsunamis with a low rate of false alarms.

ASTER,  a  cooperative  effort  between  NASA  and  Japan’s  Ministry  of  Economy
Trade and Industry, is a satellite sensing system that obtains high-resolution image
data in 14 channels over targeted areas of the Earth’s surface, as well as black-and-
white  stereo  images.  With  a  revisit  time  between  four  and  16  days,  ASTER  data
is  already  being  used  to  assess  the  damage  to  the  countries  devastated  by  the  tsu-
nami.

Science Committee Opportunities

The preliminary data from NASA indicates that new analyses of data from exist-
ing sensing systems may be useful in predicting tsunamis and other impending nat-
ural disasters. New types of sensing systems may also help in this regard. Ab initio
modeling,  taking  into  account  all  of  the  data  from  this  tsunami,  will  be  important
in understanding how to prevent future devastation. I am looking forward to work-
ing  with  the  Science  Committee  to  identify  these  opportunities  for  NOAA,  USGS,
NASA and the other federal science agencies.

Panel I:

STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JAY INSLEE, MEMBER, U.S.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr.  INSLEE.  We  are  talking  about  high  technology  here.  You
know,  people  have  described  this  event  as  a  biblical  event  that
brought  us  here  today,  and  the  same  Creator  that  created  a  world
that  is  so  dynamic  that  can  create  tragedies  like  this  also  created
the  human  mind.  And  what  we  are  really  talking  about  at  this
hearing  is  the  use  of  the  human  mind  to  guard  us  from  these  fu-
ture events, future events that we know are going to happen. This
is  not  a  hearing  about  something  that  is  uncertain.  There  is  cer-
tainty  that  we  are  going  to  experience  earthquakes  and  tsunamis
like this. The only question is when and where.

And you know, Mr. Boehlert, of all of the hearings you have ever
had,  you,  perhaps,  never  had  one  that  was  so  timely,  because  305
years ago today, January 26, 1700, a few miles off the coast of the
Pacific  in  the  United  States,  the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  rup-
tured,  and  it  created  an  earthquake  probably  equal  or  exceeding
that  off  the  coast  of  Indonesia,  and  it  sent  tidal  waves,  tsunamis
perhaps  as  much  as  50  feet  high  across  the  Pacific  coast  in  the
State of Washington. So 305 years ago today, we experienced in the
United States an event very similar in scope and potential tragedy
as they did in Indonesia. So you really could not have picked a bet-
ter day to focus the Nation’s attention on this issue.

The  bad  news  is  that  we  are  very  exposed.  This  is  a  personal
issue.  My  District  is  connected  to  the  Pacific  Ocean  on  the  shores
of Puget Sound. Washington has an exposed coastline. But we have
many  areas  in  the  country  that  have  these  potential  exposures.
That is the bad news.

The  good  news  is  that  we  have  the  scientific  capability,  due  to
some extraordinary achievements, some of, I may note, is from my
District,  that  have  the  capability  of  really  giving  us  100  percent
protection in a timely real-time warning of tsunamis. So that is the
good  news.  And  the  good  news  here,  there  is  a  success  story  al-
ready. The United States has already, before a huge tragedy, devel-
oped  at  least  the  beginnings  of  a  good  system  with  the  six  buoys
we  have  in  the  Pacific  now  already  being  developed.  And  that  is
the success story of some of the advanced thinking of our scientific
community  of  our  federal  agencies,  and  they  should  be  com-
plimented  for  that.  Now  we  need  to  give  them  the  tools  to  finish
that  job.  I  may  note  that  one  of  these  tools  that  can  detect  one
inch,  these  tools  that  sit  on  the  bottom  of  the  ocean,  they  are  an-
chored  to  the  sea  floor.  And  they  use  a  transducer  developed  by
someone in the first District of the State of Washington, I may add,
Redmond,  Washington,  they  can  note  in  five  miles  deep  water  one

inch  of  deviation  in  the  elevation  of  the  water  column  above  them
by noticing that pressure distance. This is an incredible technology.
We  simply  need  to  get  it  out  under  the  ocean.  And  that  is  why
we—I  look  forward  to  introducing  this  bill  with  you,  Mr.  Boehlert,
to do that on a bipartisan basis to get this job done.

We are talking about probably 50 buoys worldwide to provide not
only  America  but  the  world  with  this  protection.  And  that  is  one
important  point,  I  think,  of  this  effort  is  that  we  need  to  protect
our own coastlines, but we need to use our technological know-how
to  lead  the  world  in  an  international  system  to  protect  the  world’s
coastlines.  And  there  is  at  least  preliminary  thought  about  using
the  Hagemeyer  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  in  Hawaii  as  the
sort of nerve brain to distribute—analyze this information and dis-
tribute  the  warnings  worldwide,  and  I  think  that  is  something  we
should  contemplate,  because  we  really  are  the  worldwide  leaders.
I  want  to  note  just  several  things  that  I  hope  we  will  keep  in
mind  as  we  develop  this  legislation.  First,  and  Mr.  Gordon  really
mentioned  it,  the  need  for  follow  up.  This  does  not  simply  involve
sticking some buoys in the water and calling it a day. And we will
be  challenged  to  make  sure  that  this  job  gets  done  in  several  re-
spects. One, the maintenance needs, the ocean is fairly unforgiving.
Three  of  our  buoys  are  down  now.  We  need  to  make  sure  we  have
a  rigorous  maintenance  schedule.  And  we  have  to  build  in  redun-
dancy  into  this  system,  because  some  of  these  buoys  are  going  to
be  down  no  matter  what  we  do  due  to  the  stresses  of  the  ocean.
Second,  and  this  is  very  important  for,  I  think,  the  Committee
to think about, is that the buoys don’t do the job without a warning
and  educational  system  for  the  people  on  the  shorelines.  Sending
a  signal  from  a  satellite  to  Hawaii  and  then  down  from  Hawaii  to
a certain agency of the Federal Government doesn’t do any good if
we  haven’t  educated  our  citizens  of  what  to  do  and  how  to  get  the
warning to the beaches and to the schools to get that job done. We
started  that  in  the  Pacific.  I  noticed  La  Push,  Washington  is  ex-
posed. They have got a bus out there to—24 hours a day practically
to evacuate kids from an elementary school they have there. So we
have the good beginning of that system, but we have got to develop
a national system to get that job done.

False  alarms.  I  also  want  to  talk  about  a  benefit  of  this  that  is
not  often  contemplated.  One  of  the  problems  we  have  with  the  ex-
isting  system  is  that  because  it  doesn’t  have  a  sufficient  scope,  we
have  false  alarms.  And  when  you  have  false  alarms,  it  costs  you
humongous amounts of money, if I may use that scientific term. It
cost  about—Hawaii  about  $40  million  when  we  had  a  false  alarm
in  the  last  couple  decades.  This—creating  a  larger  system  will
eliminate  or  severely  reduce  false  alarms  that  will  make  this  sys-
tem  work.  It  will  save  us  a  lot  of  dollars  in  lost  tourism  and  the
like shutting down your economy.

The  last  note  I  want  to  make,  people  have  asked  about  the  cost
of  this.  These  are  very  rare  events.  The  last  event  that  damaged
the  United  States  was  305  years  ago,  so  they  are  quite  rare.  And
people have asked, you know, ‘‘Why should we protect against and
spend  millions  of  dollars  on  a  rare  event?’’  And  the  answer  is  very
simple. It is one of the best investments you can make. You know,
we have spent hundreds, literally hundreds of billions of dollars on

what,  up  until  now,  have  been  some  rare  events  of  the  terrorism
threat.  We  have  a  threat  now  that  may  be  rare  but  equally  dev-
astating,  and  that  is  tsunamis.  And  spending  somewhere  in  the
order of $40 million to get this job done, there is really no cheaper
investment to save Americans’ lives, and we ought to make it.

So I want to thank you, Mr. Boehlert and Mr. Gordon, and I look
forward  to  working  with  you,  and  I  will  answer  any  questions  or
general criticisms.

DISCUSSION

Chairman BOEHLERT. I want to thank you for an excellent state-
ment.  I  want  to  compliment  you  for  getting,  at  last  count,  seven
plugs for your District in, and you did very well in your representa-
tional capacity.

But  you  underscored  the  need  for  a  comprehensive  approach.  It
is something more than just appropriating dollars to get new gadg-
ets, and that is very important. But there has to be an educational
program,  and  it  has  to  be  a  very  comprehensive  program.  So  I
thank you for that.

Mr. Gordon, do you have any———
Mr. GORDON. Just concurring and thanking you, Jay. You under-
stand  it  very  well,  and  you  have  conveyed  that  to  us  and  to  this
group.

Mr. INSLEE. Just one more plug, too. Behind me is Dr. Eddie Ber-
nard.  I  don’t  know  if  he  is  going  to  speak  today,  but  he  has  been
an  absolute  leader  in  developing  this  system,  and  I  think  we  owe
our  tip  of  the  hats  to  the  scientific  personnel  who  advanced  this
technology before an earthquake and a tsunami has hit the United
States. Those are advanced thinkers.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yes.
Ms. WOOLSEY. Could I ask our———
Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Woolsey.
Ms.  WOOLSEY.—esteemed  guest  a  question  and  make  a  state-
ment?  And  maybe  you  can  kind  of  just,  Jay,  walk  us  through  this
a little bit.

My  fear  is  false  security.  I  mean,  you  have  both  said  that,  and
you just said that, Mr. Chairman, and you have covered it, but you
didn’t tell us how. I mean, I need to—I am sorry I am a cynic, but
I  can  see  this  all  being  put  in  place  and  then  an  event  occurs  and
we go, ‘‘Oh, we hadn’t—we didn’t prepare.’’

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Ms.  Woolsey,  let  me  point  out  that  not  all
of  the  wisdom  is  vested  in  the  distinguished  Representative  of  the
first District of Washington.

Ms. WOOLSEY. But he has got a wonderful mind, and I———
Chairman BOEHLERT. He does, indeed, but we have———
Ms. WOOLSEY. He can tell us. Tell us.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.—some  of  the  foremost  experts,  not  just  in

America, but in the world going to testify today.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Behind him?
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yes, and———

them?

Ms. WOOLSEY. So the—that is my—I have to wait and hear from

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  No,  Jay,  you  can  add  anything  you  might

care to add right now, but I———

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you.
Mr.  INSLEE.  I  think  the  Chairman  is  calling  for  a  little  humility

from the witness, so perhaps I should display that.

No, I just think, in the serious question about—this panel needs
to know—to find a way legislatively to build a foundation for fund-
ing  for  the  ongoing  maintenance  and  educational  needs.  And  I
think,  again,  it  may  be  easy—it  may  be  a  little  bit  of  a  no-brainer
to put the buoys in. And we are going to have to figure out a way,
with  the  concurrence  of  other  committees,  to  build  in  the  appro-
priations  and  the  infrastructure  to  get,  particularly,  the  edu-
cational and the warning systems domestically that are needed, in-
cluding  the  Caribbean  and  even  the  East  Coast,  where  they  are
really not—they really don’t exist. We have got a rudimentary sys-
tem  in  the—in  Washington  State.  We  really  don’t  on  the  Carib-
bean, pretty much, at all.

So I guess what I would say is I am looking to your great ideas,

Lynn.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Okay. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, thank you very much. And we would

welcome your———

Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman  BOEHLERT.—continuing  input  as  we  go  forward  with
the  development  of  legislation.  Because  make  no  mistake  about  it,
this  is  not  just  a  hearing.  This  is  the  beginning  of  a  journey,  and
we  are  going  to  travel  it  together,  and  we  are  going  to  develop  a
comprehensive  legislative  initiative  that  we  hope  will  be  market-
able to our colleagues and the Nation.

Who said—Brad?
Mr.  SHERMAN.  Yes.  I  don’t  know  whether  Jay  wants  to  respond
to  this  or  maybe  the  panel  of  experts  can  work  it  into  their  state-
ment.  But  I  would  like  to  know  if  we  have  done  enough  to  create
mathematical  models  that  could  be  used  on  an  emergency  basis  to
know  an  earthquake  occurred  here,  therefore  we  have  to  evacuate
this area or we might have to evacuate that area. And also, wheth-
er  we  have  an  early  warning  system  and  evacuation  system  that
is  integrated,  whether  it  is  tsunami,  whether  it  is  some  other  dis-
aster,  or  whether  it  is  a  dirty  bomb,  that  is  to  say,  when  we  are
planning  for  evacuation  and  warning,  it  ought  to  be  a  comprehen-
sive  system.  Perhaps  either  this  witness  or  the  next  can  focus  on
that.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Sure.  Yeah.  Because  as  you  will  learn,  as
the  testimony  goes  forward,  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  look  at
the testimony, this very important point is being addressed.

Mr.  INSLEE.  A  very  quick  comment.  I  am  very  convinced  that,
with  all  of  our  tremendous  ability  to  evaluate  the  seismic  wave
that we can pick up on our seismographs, that is not even close to
good  enough  to  really  giving  us  predictive  ability  of  where  a  wave
is  going  to  hit  and  what  its  extent  is.  I  think  the  scientists  will
back me up on that, I hope. We really need the buoy system to find
out  if  the  wave  is  there,  otherwise,  you  are  stuck  with  continual

false  alarms.  You  would  have  lack  of  compliance  with  that  issue.
You  have  enormous  economic  cost.  You  really  need  to  use  this
science  to  find  out  if  the  wave  really  exists,  and  I  look  forward  to
a bipartisan success doing that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Gilchrest.
Mr.  GILCHREST.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Just  a  quick  state-
ment  here,  because  I  may  have  to  leave  shortly  for  another  hear-
ing.

I  recently  visited,  Jay,  the  Indian  Ocean  Basin  where  all  of  the
countries  were  hit.  The  destruction  was  staggering,  incomprehen-
sible.  The  response  to  that,  by  the  international  community,  was
stunning,  and  it  continues  to  be  that  way.  When  we  went  to  Sri
Lanka  or  India,  we  asked  a  number  of  questions  to  people  whose
lives were torn apart. The most curious question and their most cu-
rious response was how did this happen and what can we do to pre-
vent it. We asked them did they know how this happened, and they
didn’t. And whether it was the Buddhists, whether it was the Mus-
lims,  whether  it  was  the  Hindus,  they  were  all  curious,  not  as  to
why it happened. They didn’t want to associate that with any reli-
gious  aspect.  They  wanted  to  know  how  it  happened,  the  physics
behind the tsunami. And then they wanted to know how they could
find out if it was going to happen again.

So  we  have  worldwide  interest  in  this  issue.  It  is  a—it  revealed
the  common  humanity  of  all  people.  Religion  was  set  aside.  Na-
tional  origin  was  set  aside.  Race  was  set  aside.  The  idea  that  hu-
mans  can  get  together  in  this  most  dynamic  process  of  nature  and
how the tsunami works.

So  Mr.  Chairman,  and  to  the  Ranking  Member,  we  have  huge
momentum  behind  this  issue,  not  only  for  the  United  States  and
all  of  our  coastal  areas,  but  the  U.S.  can  be  a  leader  in  the  world
to protect these vulnerable shorelines.

Mr.  INSLEE.  Just  let  me  note,  what  you  said  about  when  you
asked  how  did  this  happen,  it  sort  of  pointed  out  to  me  the  need
for education, how important it is for this from a safety standpoint.
In  1964,  I  think,  was  the  Alaska  earthquake,  and  I  was  living  in
Seattle  at  the  time,  so  I  saw,  and  one  of  my  classmates  explained
how  they  watched  the  water  recede.  All  of  the  water  went  out  of
the  harbor  before  the  tsunami  came  back  in.  And  we  all  knew  in
Seattle  in  that  classroom  that  if  you  ever  see  Puget  Sound  go  out,
you  head  for  the  hills.  In  places  in  Thailand,  the  tourists  headed
for the beaches to watch this abnormal occurrence, which is a, you
know,  terrible  tragedy.  It  just  points  out  the  need  for  an  edu-
cational  effort  that  I  know  the  Chair  is  going  to  lead  us  to  build.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  Thank  you,  Mr.

Gilchrest. Thank you.

physical  Union,  Dr.  Arthur  Lerner-Lam,  Director,  Columbia  Uni-
versity Center for Hazards and Risk Research, and for the purpose
of an introduction, the Chair recognizes Mr. Wu.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  my  honor  to  introduce
Mr.  Jay  Wilson  of  the  Oregon  Emergency  Management  Office.  But
first, I would like to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member
on holding this very timely hearing.

The  December  26  tragedy  in  the  Indian  Ocean  earthquake  and
the following tsunami was a tremendous tragedy, and we should do
all that we can to help in the present situation. And I want to com-
mend  people  and  organizations  around  this  country,  particularly
some  organizations,  non-profits  and  businesses  in  Oregon,  who
have  generously  helped:  Northwest  Medical  Teams,  and  Medical
Teams  Northwest.  Some  for-profit  businesses,  like  Nike  and  Intel,
I  am—it  is  my  understanding  that  the  employees  at  Intel  alone
have  contributed  $1  million  and  matched  by  $1  million  from  the
Intel Foundation. And I want to thank all Americans for their gen-
erous contributions.

And  while  we  deal  with  the  current  situation  in  Indonesia,  Sri
Lanka,  Thailand,  and  elsewhere,  at  the  same  time,  we  should  be
very  cognizant  of  the  possibility  of  significant  tsunamis  occurring
in the United States. And as Mr. Inslee previously stated, perhaps
the  greatest  largest  tsunami  to  ever  hit  our  shores  occurred  305
years  ago  today,  January  26,  1700,  in  Oregon  and  Washington
where  two  tectonic  plates  come  together.  And  it  is—the  way  that
we  calculated  this  date  is  that  there  are  historic  recordings  in
Japan,  thousands  of  miles  away,  at  a  certain  date  and  hour  when
that  tsunami  hit  the  shores  of  Japan  back  in  1700.  And  the  geolo-
gists  and  geophysicists  tell  us  that  these  huge  subduction  earth-
quakes can occur on our Pacific Northwest coast every 300 to 1,000
years.  That  is  the  current  estimate.  I  note  that  we  are  305  years
away from the last occurrence, so we are in the yellow zone, if not
the red zone, for another significant event in the Pacific Northwest.
Much  more  recently,  there  was  a  9.2  Richter  scale  earthquake  off
Alaska,  and  it  created  19  to  20-foot  waves,  which  flooded  seaside
Oregon in March of 1964.

With the Pacific Rim’s experiences in earthquakes and tsunamis,
we,  on  the  West  Coast,  take  this  threat  very,  very  seriously.  Sev-
eral  Oregon  research  universities,  such  as  Portland  State  Univer-
sity,  Oregon  State  University,  and  the  University  of  Oregon,  con-
duct cutting-edge research in tsunami. And I am also very pleased
to  say  that,  along  with  other  Pacific  coast  states,  work  together  to
prepare  and  educate  our  citizens  on  the  threats  of  tsunami.  And  I
would especially like to mention Kennan Beach, Oregon, in my Dis-
trict,  as  well  as  Mazzonina  and  Halem  on  the  border  of  my  col-
league’s and my District for being some of the four Oregon commu-
nities, which are rated as TsunamiReady communities.

It  is  my  pleasure  to  introduce  Mr.  Jay  Wilson,  the  distin-
guished—to  this  distinguished  committee.  Mr.  Wilson  is  currently
the Earthquake and Tsunami Programs Coordinator for the Oregon
Emergency Management Office. He has been working in the emer-
gency  management  field  in  California  and  Oregon,  and  now  works
hard to prepare Oregonians for tsunami.

I  am  very  happy  to  hear  that  Mr.  Wilson’s  latest  work  is  in  the
creation  of  a  tsunami  educational  pilot  project  in  Seaside,  Oregon,
and at this moment, I would like to yield to my colleague from Or-
egon, Ms. Darlene Hoosley.
Ms. HOOSLEY. Thank you.
Again,  welcome,  Mr.  Wilson.  I  had  the  privileged  of  spending
time  with  some  of  the  people  that  you  work  with  as  they  did  a
briefing  for  me  in  Salem,  all  of  the  statewide  experts  in  this  area.
So  I  appreciate  what  Oregon  is  doing,  and  that  was  interesting  as
I was on a flight a couple of weeks ago, I was sitting next to a gen-
tleman who does a lot of work in this area on—he does it both na-
tionally  and  internationally.  And  he  leaned  over  and  he  said,  ‘‘Or-
egon  has  done  the  best  job  of  preparing  of  any  state.’’  So  I  think
you should feel good about that.

We also had a series of hearings on the central coast to see what
they were doing and how prepared they were. I was pleased by the
work  that  we  have  done.  There  is  a  lot  more  work  that  needs  to
be done. But in each of these hearings, we had all of the emergency
management people. We had first responders as well as elected offi-
cials  and  community  members  talking  about  what  each  of  those
two  counties  have  done,  which  are  the  central  part—central  coast,
Lincoln and Tillamook counties. And one of the things I would like
to  do,  Mr.  Chair  and  Mr.  Ranking  Member,  is  when  we  talked,
these  groups  came  up  with  several  really  fabulous  ideas.  I  asked
them  to  go  back  and  meet  again  and  put  those  in  ranking  order.
And  what  I  would  like  to  do,  Mr.  Chair,  is  introduce  those  to  the
Committee so that we may use the———

Chairman  BOEHLERT. 

Thank 

you 

very  much. 

The

Committee———

one.

Ms. HOOSLEY. And again, thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—will be most receptive. Thank you, every-

Now let us get to our distinguished witnesses. And we would ask
that  you  summarize  your  statements  in  five  minutes  or  so.  The
Chair will not be arbitrary. It is too important a subject. But if you
condense  your  testimony,  because  we  have  your  full  written  testi-
mony, which will be part of the official record, that will allow more
time  for  those  of  us  who  need  to  be  better  educated  to  take  part
in this exercise.

So with that, Dr. Groat, you are first up.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  CHARLES  ‘‘CHIP’’  G.  GROAT,  DIRECTOR,
UNITED  STATES  GEOLOGICAL  SURVEY,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT
OF THE INTERIOR
Dr. GROAT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the opportunity to reflect on the recent tragedy in
South  Asia  and  important  to  us  here,  in  the  United  States,  and
what  can  be  done  to  reduce  the  threat  that  tsunamis  and  earth-
quakes pose to coastal communities in the United States as well as
around the globe.

Events,  such  as  this  one,  and  we  are  also  reminded  by  the  four
hurricanes  that  crossed  Florida  this  past  summer,  recent  volcanic
activity at Mount St. Helen’s, point out our vulnerability to natural
hazards. And those natural hazards, such as all of these, are inevi-

table.  They  are  geologically  and  meteorologically  inevitable,  but  as
has been pointed out several times, the consequences are not inevi-
table if we prepare for them.

As  we  move  forward,  we  have  got  to  bear  in  mind  that  we  are
being confronted here with multiple hazards. Both the tsunami and
the  earthquake  have  to  be  considered  in  planning  our  responses
and  in  instructing  our  scientific  understanding  as  we  move  that
forward in the name of public safety.

The December 26, 2004 magnitude 9 earthquake that struck the
coast  of  Sumatra,  was  initiated  20  miles  beneath  the  sea  floor  off
the  western  coast,  and  it  was  the  fourth  largest  earthquake  to
strike  the  planet  since  1900  and  the  largest  since  the  magnitude
9.2  earthquake  struck  Alaska  in  1964.  The  devastation  caused  by
both the tsunami and the earthquake are of grand proportions and
remind us, again, of the effects of these natural events on lives and
property.

As  with  other  giant  earthquakes,  this  one  took  place  in  a
subduction zone where one of the tectonic plates that make up the
Earth’s  rigid  outer  layer,  is  being  thrust  against  another.  The  size
of  the  earthquake  is  directly  related  to  the  area  of  the  fault  that
has  actually  ruptured.  This  particular  rupture  was  huge.  It  propa-
gated  northward  along  the  plate  boundary  for  almost  750  miles.
Along  the  length  of  the  fault  rupture,  the  sea  floor  was  jolted  up-
ward  as  much  as  15  feet,  lifting  trillions  of  gallons  of  sea  water,
a volume more than 30 times that of the Great Salt Lake and gen-
erating a tsunami that swept both east, inundating the coast of Su-
matra, Thailand, and Burma, and west, crossing the open ocean at
hundreds  of  miles  an  hour  on  its  way  to  the  coast  of  India,  Sri
Lanka,  and  eventually  eastern  Africa.  The  devastation  that  struck
the  coastal  Sumatra  area  can  be  seen  on  this  pair  of  land  set  im-
ages from before and after the event.

While  not  all  tsunamis  are  caused  by  earthquakes,  most  are,
thus earthquake-monitoring networks play a large role in Tsunami
Warning  Center  operations.  It  is  necessary  to  determine,  based  on
the  interpretation  of  seismic  waves  generated  by  an  earthquake,
whether  tsunami  generation  is  likely  or  not.  This  is  an  extremely
important  fact,  because  there  are  many  kinds  of  earthquakes,  and
not  all  that  are  large  even  generate  tsunamis.  So  interpretation  of
the  information  we  get  from  this  monitoring  network  is  critical  in
informing  those  responsible  for  tsunami  warnings  whether  or  not
there is likely to be one.

To  monitor  seismic  events  worldwide,  the  Global  Seismographic
Network, the GSN, maintains the constellation of 128 globally dis-
tributed,  modern  seismic  sensor.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  oper-
ates  about  o  of  this  network,  and  the  University  of  California,  San
Diego,  operates  the  other  B  with  NSF  support.  NSF  also  funds  the
Incorporated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology  (IRIS)  Consor-
tium  to  handle  data  management  and  the  long-term  archiving.  As
you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, the role of NSF in funding both the
monitoring and the science in this important area is extremely im-
portant and needs to be continued and increased. In the case of the
Sumatra  earthquake,  automated  analysis  of  data  from  the  Global
Seismic  Network  stations  generated  the  alert  of  strong  recorded
amplitudes  that  were  sent  to  NOAA  and  to  the  USGS.  At  the

present  time,  about  80  percent  of  this  network  transmits  data  in
real  time  that  can  be  used  for  rapid  earthquake  analysis  and  tsu-
nami  warnings.  A  hallmark  of  our  efforts  to  upgrade  this  system
is  to  increase  our  ability  to  receive  this  data  in  real  time  and  to
upgrade our capability in the scientific community of analyzing this
data  very  quickly  and  providing  the  results  of  those  analyses  to
people responsible for issuing warnings.

In the United States, we face a major risk from subduction zone
earthquakes,  like  the  one  that  struck  Sumatra.  The  most  recent
was a magnitude 9.2 earthquake that struck Alaska in 1964. How-
ever, the greatest risk, as pointed out by several Members, is in the
Pacific  northwest.  At  the  1700  Cascadia  subduction  zone  that  was
mentioned  before,  the  earthquake  along  the  Pacific  coast  in  Or-
egon,  Washington,  California,  and  British  Columbia  is  particularly
notable.  This  event  was  of  the  same  general  size  as  the  Sumatra
earthquake, and it caused coastal marshes to suddenly drop several
feet.  Based  on  return  interval,  USGS  scientists  and  others  who
work  on  this  aspect  of  it,  have  estimated  that  there  is  a  10  to  14
percent chance of a repeat of the Cascadia magnitude 9 earthquake
and  tsunami  in  the  next  50  years,  so  that  gives  you  some  sense  of
the order of risk that we are facing, as Mr. Wu pointed out.

To  monitor  earthquakes  in  the  United  States,  the  USGS  has
begun  to  install  and  operate  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  Sys-
tem, part of the NEHRP process, to provide seismic data to NOAA’s
Tsunami  Warning  Centers.  The  system  includes  a  63-station  Ad-
vanced  National  Seismic  System  (ANSS)  backbone  network,  which
is  capable  of  locating  most  felt  earthquakes  nationwide  and  pro-
vides data in near real time to the USGS. Extending our capability
in high-hazards areas of the U.S. are 17 regional seismic networks
that  provide  detailed  coverage  and  rapid  response  both—and  local
expertise  and  event  analysis  and  interpretation  of  this  data  is  an
important part of these local networks.

On  December  29,  the  President  asked  the  Departments  of  Com-
merce  and  Interior  to  determine  whether  our  warning  systems  are
adequately  prepared  for  tsunamis  that  could  affect  the  United
States  coasts  and  the  coasts  of  those  interests  that  the  United
States has. As a result, the Administration has announced its com-
mitment to implement and improve domestic seismic detection and
warning  systems.  And  as  part  of  the  President’s  plan,  the  USGS
will upgrade its ability to provide NOAA with timely interpretation
of seismic data from earthquakes, including their potential for tsu-
nami  generation  by  doing  the  following.  And  I  want  to  point  out
here  that  the  point  that  we  can  start  and  then  forget  is  not  lost
on  what  we  have  proposed  to  do.  We  are  trying  to  upgrade  a  sys-
tem  that  is  important  not  only  to  tsunamis,  but  also  to  earth-
quakes, and provide the resources that will continue this system in
an  advanced  state  of  readiness  in  the  outcoming  years  so  that  we
do  not  become  complacent  and  figure  we  solve  the  problem  with  a
one-time effect.

So  we  plan  to  implement  24  x  7  operations  in  the  National
Earthquake  Information  Center  in  Golden,  Colorado,  and  upgrade
the  hardware  and  software  systems  in  order  to  improve  the  proc-
essing  of  earthquake  data  from  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world.  As
part of this upgrade, we will fully develop what is now a prototype

system to estimate the number of people affected by strong ground
motion  after  an  earthquake  using  our  ShakeMap  model  and  data-
bases  of  global  population.  This  PAGER  system,  which  is—stands
for  the  Prompt  Assessment  of  Global  Earthquakes  for  Response,
can provide eight agencies and others with a quick estimate of how
significant  casualties  might  be  well  in  advance  of  reports  from  af-
fected areas where communications may be down, so here again, an
important forecasting tool to provide those responsible for response
with early information. Thus these improvements at the NEIC, the
National  Earthquake  Information  Center,  will  increase  our  ability
to  provide  relevant  information  about  earthquake  hazards  as  well
as their tsunami generation potential.

and  discriminating 

earthquakes 

We also plan to improve the detection response time of the Glob-
al  Seismographic  Network  by  making  data  from  all  stations  avail-
able  in  real  time,  using  satellite  telemetry  and  improving  station
up-time  through  increased  maintenance  schedules.  This  again  has
been  pointed  out  as  an  extremely  important  part  of  any  warning
system.  We  have  to  have  the  resources  to  make  sure  that  it  is  up-
graded, that it is maintained, so that it is always ready.

We also intend to improve coverage in the Caribbean region. We
will  achieve  that  through  the  addition  of  some  seismic  stations
there  and  upgrades  of  existing  stations  through  cooperation  with
international partnerships in that area.

And finally, we will further the use of software developed by the
California Integrated Seismic Network, which is a USGS university
and State partnership, to speed USGS generated earthquake infor-
mation directly to local emergency managers with a dual-use capa-
bility to also provide that information to NOAA.

And  finally,  getting  to  the  importance  that  has  been  pointed  out
of understanding what the impacts on our coastal areas will be. Do
we understand the nature of the topography, the terrain, the infra-
structure that is there in a way that can be fed into models for the
generation  of  projected  impacts?  We  plan,  as  part  of  our  coopera-
tive  effort  with  NOAA  and  others,  to  enhance  our  capabilities  to
provide  elevation  mapping  for  coastal  areas—in  the  United  States
and  in  the  Caribbean  and  provide  this  information  for  improved
tsunami  hazards  assessments  in  the  U.S.,  in  general,  but  particu-
larly in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The  earthquake  which  contributed  significantly  to  the  loss  of
lives  and  property  will  encourage  us  to  continue  forward  on  the
comprehensive NEHRP approach to earthquake loss. Here again, I
think  a  model  of  interagency  cooperation  where  we,  FEMA,  NIST,
and  the  National  Science  Foundation  work  together  to  translate
good  science  into  hazard  reduction  programs.  So  we  translate  our
understanding, through monitoring and research, through such ini-
tiatives  as  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  and  also  the
work  of  the  George  Brown,  Jr.  Network  for  Earthquake  Engineer-
ing  Simulation.  These  activities  will  accelerate  the  use  of  new
earthquake risk mitigation technologies and the development of im-
proved seismic provisions in building codes.

In  closing,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  USGS  will  also  continue  ongoing
collaboration  with  NOAA,  FEMA,  and  other  agencies  and  univer-
sities  to  improve  tsunami  hazard  assessments  and  warning
through  geologic  investigations  into  the  history  and  the  potential
for  tsunami  occurrences.  We  learn  about  the  present  from  under-
standing  the  past,  and  the  records  of  things  that  happened  pre-
history are extremely important, so geologic and geomorphic under-
standings  are  gained  through  active  research  and  active  mapping,
and we plan to continue that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Dr. GROAT. We also plan to help provide better products in terms
of  inundation  maps  and  propagation  maps  and  supply  information
that will support the very kinds of models that were questioned be-
fore. And we will also continue in the Indian Ocean to understand,
based  on  that,  what  the  impacts  were  there  to  inform  our  under-
standing in the United States.

With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  close  and  be  welcoming  ques-

tions you pose.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Groat follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHARLES G. GROAT

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
discuss the recent tragedy in South Asia and what can be done to reduce the threat
that  tsunamis  and  earthquakes  pose  to  coastal  communities  in  the  United  States
and around the globe. Events such as this serve as a tragic reminder of our vulner-
ability to natural hazards. While the United States is not as vulnerable to tsunamis
as other regions of the world, we do face significant risk.

On December 29, the President asked the Departments of Interior and Commerce
to  determine  whether  our  systems  are  adequately  prepared  for  a  tsunami  on  our
coasts. As a result, the Administration announced its commitment to implement an
improved  domestic  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system.  As  part  of  the  Presi-
dent’s  plan,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  will  strengthen  its  ability  to  detect
global  earthquakes  both  through  improvements  in  the  Global  Seismographic  Net-
work (GSN), which we support jointly with the National Science Foundation (NSF),
and  through  around-the-clock  analysis  of  earthquake  events.  The  changes  that  are
proposed  for  USGS  clearly  have  a  dual  purpose,  improving  our  capacity  to  respond
to earthquakes as well as supporting the tsunami warning program of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

In addition to earthquake monitoring and reporting, the USGS conducts a number
of activities aimed at improving tsunami hazard assessments, education, and warn-
ings,  including  geologic  investigations  into  the  history  of  and  potential  for  tsunami
occurrence,  coastal  and  marine  mapping,  and  modeling  tsunami  generation.  Al-
though  most  tsunamis  are  caused  by  earthquakes,  they  can  also  be  caused  by  vol-
canic  eruptions,  submarine  landslides,  and  onshore  landslides  that  cause  large  vol-
umes of rock to fall into the water. All of these tsunami-generating hazards can im-
pact  the  United  States.  Consequently,  a  broad  range  of  USGS  work  in  earthquake,
volcano and landslide hazards, and coastal and marine geology, contribute to better
understanding of tsunami impacts and occurrences.

Additionally,  USGS  is  playing  a  role  in  relief  efforts  for  nations  impacted  by  the
December  26  disaster  by  providing  relief  organizations  worldwide  with  pre-  and
post-tsunami satellite images and image-derived products that incorporate informa-
tion  on  population  density,  elevation,  and  other  relevant  topics.  These  images  and
products are being used by relief organizations to determine where relief efforts are
most  critical  and  how  best  to  carry  out  those  relief  operations.  In  our  efforts  to  as-
sist  and  improve  relief  efforts,  we  work  closely  with  partners  at  NOAA,  the  U.S.
Agency for International Development, other federal agencies, and in academia. For
example,  USGS  scientists  are  part  of  international  teams  conducting  post-tsunami
investigations  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Indonesia  with  the  goal  of  applying  the  knowledge
developed to other vulnerable areas in the United States and around the globe.

USGS  is  also  working  with  NOAA  and  other  domestic  and  global  partners
through the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) and other mecha-
nisms.  Through  GEOSS,  improved  monitoring  capabilities  must  be  firmly  linked

into  all-hazards  warning  systems  and,  the  most  important  link  in  the  chain,  public
education  and  mitigation  programs.  As  we  move  forward,  we  must  bear  in  mind
that  this  was  an  earthquake  disaster  as  well  as  a  tsunami  disaster,  and  we  must
learn from both. This is not just a scientific endeavor; it is a matter of public safety.
Earthquake and Tsunami of December 26, 2004

This  was  the  second  year  in  a  row  in  which  a  deadly  earthquake  occurred  near
the  end  of  the  year.  In  2003,  a  magnitude  6.6  quake  struck  Iran’s  ancient  city  of
Bam,  killing  over  30,000  people.  In  2004,  the  deadly  quake  was  a  magnitude  9
earthquake that initiated 20 miles below the seafloor off the western coast of Suma-
tra,  the  fourth  largest  earthquake  to  strike  the  planet  since  1900  and  the  largest
since  a  magnitude  9.2  earthquake  struck  Alaska  in  1964.  The  earthquake  and  re-
sulting  tsunami  killed  more  than  150,000  people  around  the  Indian  Ocean,  two-
thirds of them in northern Sumatra, whose inhabitants experienced not only the se-
vere shaking from the earthquake but also the tsunami’s full force.

As  with  other  giant  earthquakes,  this  one  took  place  along  a  subduction  zone,
where one of the tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s rigid outer layer is being
thrust  beneath  another  (see  Figure  1).  The  Sunda  trench  is  the  seafloor  expression
of  such  a  plate  boundary  where  the  Indian  plate  is  thrusting  under  the  overriding
Burma  plate.  The  size  of  an  earthquake  is  directly  related  to  the  area  of  the  fault
that is ruptured. This rupture propagated northward along the plate boundary fault
for over 750 miles beneath the Nicobar and Andaman Islands almost to Burma with
a  width  of  over  100  miles  and  slip  along  the  fault  averaging  several  tens  of  feet.

It  is  difficult  to  comprehend  the  scope  of  a  magnitude  9  earthquake.  When  we
hear the term earthquake magnitude, we think of the Richter scale, which was the
first  of  several  scales  developed  to  measure  the  earthquake  size  from  the  seismic
waves  they  generate.  These  scales  are  logarithmic  such  that  each  whole  number
represents an order of magnitude larger in the seismic waves generated. So a mag-
nitude  7  earthquake  is  10  times  larger  than  a  magnitude  6  and  100  times  larger

than  a  magnitude  5.  However,  the  amount  of  energy  released  goes  up  much  faster.
This  magnitude  9  earthquake  released  32  times  more  energy  than  a  magnitude  8
earthquake  and  1000  times  more  energy  than  a  magnitude  7  earthquake  such  as
the  one  that  struck  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area  in  1989.  The  energy  released  by
the  Sumatra  earthquake  is  roughly  equal  to  that  released  by  all  the  earthquakes,
of every size, everywhere in the world since the mid-1990s. It’s important to remem-
ber  that  our  own  coasts,  Alaska  in  1964  and  the  Pacific  Northwest  in  1700,  were
the site of earthquakes as large as the Sumatra earthquake.

A great deal of that energy was transferred to the Indian Ocean’s waters and ulti-
mately to its surrounding shores. Along the length of the fault rupture, the seafloor
was  jolted  upward  by  as  much  as  15  feet,  lifting  trillions  of  gallons  of  sea  water—
a volume more than 30 times that of the Great Salt Lake—and generating the tsu-
nami  that  swept  both  east,  inundating  the  coast  of  Sumatra,  Thailand  and  Burma,
and  west,  crossing  the  open  ocean  at  hundreds  of  miles  per  hour  on  its  way  to  the
coasts of India, Sri Lanka, and eventually eastern Africa.

Tsunamis  strike  the  Indian  Ocean  less  frequently  than  the  Pacific  Ocean,  which
is  ringed  by  subduction  zones,  but  there  have  been  at  least  a  half  dozen  Indian
Ocean  tsunamis  caused  by  earthquakes  in  the  past  200  years.  What  had  been  the
deadliest tsunami in the region was not caused by an earthquake but by the explo-
sion  of  Krakatau  volcano  in  1883.  The  tsunami  generated  by  the  collapse  of  that
volcano killed 36,000 people on Java, Sumatra and neighboring islands.

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  not  all  large  subsea  earthquakes  generate
tsunamis.  For  example,  four  days  before  the  Sumatra  earthquake,  a  magnitude  8.1
earthquake  struck  the  seafloor  south  of  New  Zealand  near  the  Macquarie  Islands.
Instead  of  generating  a  thrusting  motion  as  in  a  subduction  zone,  this  earthquake
occurred  on  a  strike-slip  fault,  moving  side  to  side  like  the  San  Andreas  Fault,  a
motion  much  less  efficient  at  creating  a  tsunami.  No  tsunami  was  generated.  Even
earthquakes generated in subduction zones may not produce tsunami, depending on
whether  the  fault  rupture  reaches  the  seafloor,  the  amount  of  displacement  on  the
fault  and  other  factors.  One  of  the  key  roles  of  a  tsunami  detection  system  is  to
avoid false warnings that cause costly and unnecessary evacuations that can under-
mine  people’s  willingness  to  heed  warnings  in  the  future.  In  addition  to  buoys  and
tide  gauges,  seismic  data  may  be  able  to  provide  an  additional  check,  and  research
in  this  area  could  improve  our  ability  to  recognize  tsunami-causing  events  in  min-
utes.
U.S.  earthquake  monitoring  networks  and  their  role  in  tsunami  warning

center operations

To monitor earthquakes in the United States, the USGS has begun to install and
operate  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  (ANSS),  which  was  established  by
the  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP)  in  2000  (P.L.  106–
503).  The  system  includes  a  63-station  ANSS  Backbone  Network,  which  is  capable
of locating most felt earthquakes nationwide and provides data in near-real-time to
USGS. Extending our capability in high-hazard areas of the country are 17 regional
seismic  networks  that  provide  detailed  coverage  and  rapid  response,  local  expertise
in  event  analysis  and  interpretation,  and  data.  Our  ANSS  partnerships—which  in-
clude  universities,  State  government  agencies  and  NSF—greatly  leverage  USGS
seismic monitoring capabilities. The key products of the system are rapid and accu-
rate earthquake locations and magnitudes, delivered directly to users for emergency
response.

In  several  of  the  highest-risk  urban  areas  in  the  United  States,  dense  arrays  of
seismic  sensors  designed  to  record  strong  ground  motion  have  been  deployed  under
ANSS. These areas include the Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Anchorage and
Salt  Lake  City  metropolitan  regions.  When  triggered  by  an  earthquake,  data  from
these  sensors  are  automatically  processed  into  detailed  maps  of  ground  shaking
(‘‘ShakeMaps’’),  which  in  turn  feed  loss  estimation  and  emergency  response.  Also,
because earthquake losses are closely tied to the vulnerability of buildings and other
structures, USGS monitors earthquake shaking in structures in support of engineer-
ing  research,  performance-based  design,  and  rapid  post-earthquake  damage  evalua-
tions.  If  placed  in  certain  critical  facilities,  these  sensors  can  contribute  to  critical
post-earthquake response decisions.

USGS  has  set  a  minimum  performance  goal  of  determining  automated  locations
and  seismic  magnitudes  within  four  minutes  or  less  in  the  U.S.  This  is  exceeded
in  many  ANSS  regions;  for  example,  the  magnitude  6.5  San  Simeon,  California,
earthquake of December, 2003, was automatically located within 30 seconds. Earth-
quake data, including locations, magnitudes, other characterizations and, where re-
quested, the actual seismograms, are automatically transmitted from USGS and re-
gional centers to federal response departments and agencies such as the NOAA tsu-

nami warning centers, the Department of Homeland Security, including the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), State governments, local emergency man-
agers,  utility  operators,  several  private  sector  entities,  and  the  public  and  media.
USGS  does  not  currently  have  24 ×  7  earthquake  analysis,  but  analysts  are  on-call
in the event of a large earthquake worldwide. The Administration has recently pro-
posed  24  ×  7  operations  as  a  key  needed  improvement  in  response  to  the  Indian
Ocean tsunami disaster.

To  monitor  seismic  events  worldwide,  the  Global  Seismographic  Network  (GSN)
maintains a constellation of 128 globally distributed, modern seismic sensors. USGS
operates  about  two-thirds  of  this  network,  and  the  University  of  California,  San
Diego,  operates  the  other  third  with  NSF  support.  NSF  also  funds  the  IRIS  (Incor-
porated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology)  Consortium  to  handle  data  manage-
ment and long-term archiving. Two GSN stations were the first to detect the Decem-
ber 26, 2004, Sumatra earthquake, and automated analysis of these data generated
the ‘‘alerts’’ of strong recorded amplitudes sent to NOAA and USGS. At the present
time,  about  80  percent  of  GSN  stations  transmit  real-time  data  that  can  be  used
for rapid earthquake analysis and tsunami warning. The Administration is request-
ing  funding  to  extend  the  GSN’s  real-time  data  communications,  as  well  as  to  im-
prove station uptime through more frequent maintenance. These changes will result
in improved tsunami warning in the United States and globally.

Through  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program,  the  USGS,  NOAA,
FEMA,  and  five  western  States  (Alaska,  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon  and  Wash-
ington)  have  worked  to  enhance  the  quality  and  quantity  of  seismic  data  provided
to  the  NOAA  tsunami  warning  centers  and  how  this  data  is  used  at  the  State  and
local  level.  This  program  has  funded  USGS  to  upgrade  seismic  equipment  for  re-
gional  seismic  networks  in  northern  California,  Oregon,  Washington,  Alaska  and
Hawaii. The seismic data recorded by the USGS nationally and globally are relayed
to the NOAA tsunami warning centers. USGS and NOAA also exchange earthquake
locations  and  magnitude  estimates,  with  USGS  providing  the  final  authoritative
magnitudes  of  events.  USGS  is  also  working  with  emergency  managers  in  the  Pa-
cific Northwest to support public warning systems in coastal communities there.

Improving  earthquake  monitoring  in  the  United  States—with  consequent  im-
provements to public safety and the reduction of earthquake losses—can be achieved
through the modernization and expansion of the ANSS, including expansion of seis-
mic  sensor  networks  nationwide,  the  upgrading  of  the  associated  data  processing
and  analysis  facilities,  and  the  development  of  new  earthquake  products.  Funding
over the past three years has focused on installation of over 500 new seismic sensors
in  high-risk  urban  areas.  The  FY05  appropriation  for  ANSS  is  $5.12  million.  The
President’s  proposed  increase  in  funding  to  USGS  in  response  to  the  tsunami  dis-
aster would allow USGS to make critically needed improvements to performance in
one key element of ANSS, providing 24 × 7 operations capacity and completing soft-
ware  and  hardware  upgrades  to  speed  processing  times.  These  improvements  will
enhance USGS support of NOAA’s tsunami warning responsibility.
The threat from tsunamis and great earthquakes in the Pacific

The concentration of U.S. tsunami warning efforts in the Pacific reflects the great-
er  frequency  of  destructive  tsunami  in  that  ocean.  Approximately  85  percent  of  the
world’s tsunamis occur in the Pacific. This is due to many subduction zones ringing
the  Pacific  basin—the  source  of  submarine  earthquakes  of  large  enough  magnitude
(greater  than  ∼7)  to  produce  tsunami.  While  Hawaii’s  position  in  the  middle  of  the
Pacific  makes  it  uniquely  vulnerable  to  ocean-wide  tsunami,  this  chain  of  volcanic
islands also faces a hazard from locally generated tsunami due to local earthquakes
or  submarine  landslides.  In  1975,  a  magnitude  7.2  earthquake  just  offshore  the  is-
land of Hawaii caused a tsunami that killed two with maximum runup height (ele-
vation reached by tsunami as they move inland from the shoreline) of 47 feet.

U.S. Insular Areas in the Pacific also face a threat both from ocean-wide tsunami
as well as ones generated locally. The volcano Anatahan in the Northern Marianas,
which began actively erupting on January 5, 2005, serves as a reminder that inhab-
itants  and  U.S.  military  interests  in  the  Commonwealth  of  the  Northern  Mariana
Islands and the Territory of Guam are threatened by nine islands with active volca-
noes that have the potential to generate hazardous ash plumes as well as tsunamis
through eruption-induced collapse. The risks from tsunamis to the inhabited islands
are  poorly  understood,  and  tsunami  inundation  modeling  is  needed  to  assess  the
threat represented by such an event.

Our  knowledge  of  what  may  be  the  greatest  risk  to  the  United  States  does  not
come from our tsunami experiences of the last half century, but rather to the detec-
tive  work  of  USGS  and  other  scientists  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.  In  contrast  to  the
San  Andreas  Fault,  where  the  Pacific  and  North  American  plates  are  sliding  past

one  another,  a  subduction  zone  known  as  Cascadia  lies  offshore  further  north,  its
size nearly identical to that of the rupture zone of the Sumatra earthquake (see Fig-
ure  2).  On  January  26,  1700,  the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  broke  in  a  great  earth-
quake,  probably  from  northernmost  California  to  the  middle  of  Vancouver  Island.
Along  the  Pacific  coast  in  Oregon,  Washington,  California,  and  British  Columbia,
this huge event of the same general size of the Sumatra earthquake, caused coastal
marshes  to  suddenly  drop  down  several  feet.  This  change  in  land  elevation  was  re-
corded  by  the  vegetation  living  in  and  around  the  coastal  marshes.  For  example,
along  the  Copalis  River  in  Washington  State,  Western  Red  Cedar  trees  that  have
lifespans of over 1,000 years were suddenly submerged in salt water. Over the next
few  months,  those  trees  died.  By  comparing  tree  rings  of  the  still  standing  dead
trees  with  nearby  trees  that  were  not  submerged,  paleoseismologists  established
that the trees were killed during the winter of 1699–1700.

Digging  through  river  bank  deposits  along  the  Copalis  and  other  rivers  in
Cascadia,  paleoseismologists  found  a  pervasive,  black  sand  sheet  left  by  the  tsu-
nami.  Because  the  sands  deposited  by  the  tsunami  are  transported  by  the  tsunami

waves,  paleoseismologists  can  combine  the  location  of  tsunami  sands  with  the
change  in  marsh  elevation  to  get  an  approximate  idea  of  the  length  of  the  rupture
for  the  1700  earthquake.  Tsunami  sands  have  been  found  from  Vancouver  Island
to Humboldt Bay in California.

Once  paleoseismologists  found  evidence  of  the  1700  event,  they  combed  written
records  in  Japan  to  see  if  evidence  existed  of  an  unknown  tsunami  wave.  Several
villages  recorded  damage  in  Japan  on  January  27,  1700,  from  a  wave  that  people
living  along  the  coast  could  not  associate  with  strong  ground  shaking.  The  coast  of
Japan  had  been  hit,  not  unlike  Sri  Lanka  and  Somalia,  by  a  distant  tsunami,  but
this  tsunami  came  from  the  west  coast  of  North  America.  By  modeling  the  travel
time  across  the  Pacific,  paleoseismologists  were  able  to  establish  the  exact  date  of
the last Cascadia subduction zone event.

Based  on  estimates  of  the  return  interval,  USGS  scientists  and  others  have  esti-
mated  that  there  is  a  10–14  percent  chance  of  a  repeat  of  the  Cascadia  magnitude
9  earthquake  and  tsunami  event  in  the  next  50  years.  Since  that  initial  discovery
in  the  early  1980s,  many  of  the  elements  of  the  seismic  systems  for  the  Pacific
Northwest  described  above  have  been  put  in  place  along  with  improved  building
codes to address the higher expected ground shaking and increased public education
through the efforts of State and local emergency managers.

The  December  26,  2004,  earthquake  and  tsunami  together  cause  us  to  focus  on
the  similar  threat  from  the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  that  faces  the  Pacific  North-
west  as  well  as  our  long  Alaskan  coastline.  Here  I  cannot  emphasize  enough  the
critical  role  played  by  our  partners  in  State  and  local  government,  especially  the
State  emergency  managers.  Largely  through  the  efforts  of  the  National  Tsunami
Hazard Mitigation Program partnership, much has been accomplished. Seismic sys-
tems have been improved, allowing NOAA’s West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warn-
ing  Center  to  issue  warnings  within  minutes  of  a  significant  offshore  earthquake.
Inundation maps, graphic representations of estimates of how far inland future tsu-
nami waves are likely to reach, are available for most major communities in north-
ern California, Oregon, and Washington. Working with FEMA, public education has
been  stressed,  and  emergency  managers  have  begun  installing  all-hazard  warning
systems. USGS is co-funding a $540,000 pilot project in Seaside, Oregon with FEMA
and NOAA to develop risk identification products that will help communities under-
stand  their  actual  level  of  risk  from  tsunami  in  a  way  that  could  be  conveyed  on
existing flood maps. The goal of the project is to develop techniques that can be used
to determine the probability and magnitude of tsunami in other communities along
the west coast of the United States.
Tsunami threats in the Atlantic

With  respect  to  tsunami  hazard  risk  to  the  U.S.  East  coast,  it  should  be  noted
that  subduction  zones  are  scarce  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  But  the  Atlantic  Ocean  is
not  immune  to  tsunami.  A  tsunami  following  the  great  1755  Lisbon  earthquake,
generated by collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, devastated coasts
of  Portugal  and  Morocco,  reached  the  British  Isles,  and  crested  as  much  as  20  feet
high in the Caribbean.

In 1929, the magnitude 7.2 Grand Banks earthquake triggered a submarine land-
slide and tsunami that struck Newfoundland’s sparsely settled coast, where it killed
27  people  with  waves  as  high  as  20  feet.  An  event  like  this,  involving  a  submarine
landslide, may be the most likely scenario for the Atlantic coast. Scars of past large
submarine landslides abound on the continental slope off the U.S. Atlantic coast. As
in  the  1929  Grand  Banks  event,  some  of  the  slides  probably  resulted  from  large
earthquakes. If earthquakes are the primary initiator of the observed landslide fea-
tures,  the  hazard  to  the  Atlantic  coast  is  limited  as  large  earthquakes  rarely  occur
in the vicinity of the U.S. and Canada Atlantic coast-perhaps once a century, on av-
erage (Boston area, 1755; Charleston, 1866; Newfoundland, 1929). Additionally, this
type  of  tsunami  would  affect  a  much  smaller  geographical  area  than  one  generated
by  a  subduction  zone,  and  its  flooding  effect  and  inundation  distance  would  be  lim-
ited. Much work is needed, however, to more fully understand the triggering of sub-
marine landslides and the extent of that threat in the Atlantic.

Another  tsunami  scenario  for  the  Atlantic  coast  that  has  been  widely  publicized
is  a  landslide  involving  collapse  of  part  of  the  Cumbre  Vieja  volcano  in  the  Canary
Islands into the sea. While this collapse would be dramatic and might indeed induce
a  trans-atlantic  tsunami,  such  a  collapse  may  occur  only  once  every  hundred  thou-
sand  years.  Furthermore,  unlike  the  West  Coast  with  the  abundant  record  of  past
ocean-wide tsunami deposits, no such regionally extensive deposits have been found
to date along the Atlantic coast.

Tsunami threats in the Caribbean

34

The Caribbean is subject to a broad range of geologic processes that have the po-
tential  to  generate  tsunami.  Indeed,  the  Caribbean  tectonic  plate  has  almost  all  of
the  tsunami-generating  sources  within  a  small  geographical  area.  Subduction  zone
earthquakes  of  the  type  that  generated  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  are  found  along
the Lesser Antilles and the Hispaniola and Puerto Rico trenches. Other moderately
large earthquakes due to more local tectonic activity take place probably once a cen-
tury, such as in Mona Passage (1918 tsunami) and in the Virgin Islands basin (1867
tsunami).  Moderate  earthquakes  occur  that  may  trigger  undersea  landslides  and
thus  generate  tsunami.  An  active  underwater  volcano  (Kick’em  Jenny  near  Gre-
nada)  where  sea  floor  maps  show  previous  episodes  of  flank  collapse  also  poses  a
tsunami  hazard.  Above-water  volcanic  activity  occurs,  wherein  the  Lesser  Antilles
periodically generate landslides that enter the sea to cause tsunami. And finally, the
possibility exists of tele-tsunami from the African-Eurasian plate boundary, such as
the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 described above.

In  1867,  an  18-foot  high  tsunami  wave  entered  St.  Thomas’  Charlotte  Amalie  at
the  same  time  that  a  27-foot  wave  entered  St.  Croix’s  Christiansted  Harbor.  Were
that  to  occur  again  today,  the  10-fold  increase  in  population  density,  the  cruise
ships,  petroleum  carriers,  harbor  infrastructure,  hotels  and  beach  goers,  nearby
power plants, petrochemical complexes, marinas, condominiums, and schools, would
all be at risk.

On  October  11,  1918,  the  island  of  Puerto  Rico  was  struck  by  a  magnitude  7.5
earthquake,  centered  approximately  15  kilometers  off  the  island’s  northwestern
coast,  in  the  Mona  Passage.  In  addition  to  causing  widespread  destruction  across
Puerto  Rico,  the  quake  generated  a  medium  sized  tsunami  that  produced  runup  as
high  as  18  feet  along  the  western  coast  of  the  island  and  killed  40  people,  in  addi-
tion to the 76 people killed by the earthquake. More than 1,600 people were report-
edly killed along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic in 1946 by a tsunami
triggered by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake.

In contrast to the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico has low tsunami risk. The region
is  seismically  quiet  and  protected  from  tsunami  generated  in  either  the  Atlantic  or
the Caribbean by Florida, Cuba, and broad continental shelves. Although there have
been  hurricane-generated  subsea  landslides  as  recently  as  this  fall,  there  is  no  evi-
dence that they have generated significant tsunami.
Lessons learned: What the United States can do to better prepare itself and

the world

Natural  hazard  events  such  as  the  one  that  struck  Sumatra  and  the  countries
around  the  Indian  Ocean  on  December  26,  2004,  are  geologically  inevitable,  but
their consequences are not. The tsunami is a potent reminder that while the nations
surrounding  the  Pacific  Ocean  face  the  highest  tsunami  hazard,  countries  around
other ocean basins lacking basic tsunami warning systems and mitigation strategies
face  considerable  risk.  Reducing  that  risk  requires  a  broad,  comprehensive  system
including  rapid  global  earthquake  and  tsunami  detection  systems,  transmission  of
warnings  in  standardized  formats  to  emergency  officials  who  already  know  which
coastal  areas  are  vulnerable  through  inundation  mapping  and  tsunami  hazard  as-
sessment, and broadcast capabilities to reach a public already educated in the dan-
gers and how to respond. For tsunami crossing an ocean basin, an adequate system
of  earthquake  sensors,  Deep-ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART)
buoys,  and  tide  gauges  should  allow  for  timely  warnings  if  the  rest  of  the  system
is in place. For tsunami generated near the coastline, time is considerably more crit-
ical. For tsunami warnings to be effective, they must be generated and transmitted
to the affected coastline within a few minutes of detection, local emergency respond-
ers must be prepared, the population must be informed, and the entire system must
be executed without delay.

The Sumatra earthquake and its devastating effects will encourage us to continue
forward  on  the  comprehensive  NEHRP  approach  to  earthquake  loss  reduction.
USGS  is  committed  to  do  so  in  partnership  with  FEMA,  the  National  Institute  of
Standards and Technology, and NSF to translate research into results through such
initiatives as ANSS, the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering
Simulation,  the  plan  to  accelerate  the  use  of  new  earthquake  risk  mitigation  tech-
nologies, and development of improved seismic provisions in building codes.

As  part  of  the  President’s  plan  to  improve  tsunami  detection  and  warning  sys-

tems, the USGS will:

• Implement 24 ×  7 operations at the National Earthquake Information Center
and  upgrade  hardware  and  software  systems  in  order  to  improve  the  timeli-
ness of alerts for global earthquakes. As part of the upgrade, USGS will fully

develop what is now a prototype system to estimate the number of people af-
fected  by  strong  ground  shaking  after  an  earthquake  using  our  ShakeMap
model  and  databases  of  global  population.  Known  as  Prompt  Assessment  of
Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER), this system can provide aid agen-
cies and others with a quick estimate of how significant the casualties might
be well in advance of reports from affected areas where communications may
be down.

• Support  research  to  develop  more  rapid  methods  for  characterizing  earth-

quakes and discriminating likely tsunamigenic sources.

• Improve the detection response time of the Global Seismographic Network by
making  data  from  all  stations  available  in  real  time  via  satellite  telemetry
and improving station up-time through increased maintenance schedules. Im-
proved  coverage  in  the  Caribbean  region  will  be  achieved  through  the  addi-
tion  of  stations  and  upgrades  of  existing  stations  through  international  part-
nerships and cooperation.

• Further  the  use  of  software  developed  by  the  California  Integrated  Seismic
Network  (a  USGS,  university  and  State  partnership)  to  speed  USGS-gen-
erated  earthquake  information  directly  to  local  emergency  managers  with  a
dual use capability to also provide NOAA tsunami warnings.

• Enhance  existing  USGS  geologic  and  elevation  mapping  for  coastal  areas  in
the  Caribbean.  Such  mapping  is  critical  to  development  of  improved  tsunami
hazards assessments for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The  USGS  will  also  continue  its  ongoing  efforts  to  improve  tsunami  hazard  as-
sessment  and  warnings  through  geologic  investigations  into  the  history  of  and  po-
tential for tsunami occurrence; coastal and marine mapping; modeling tsunami gen-
eration,  source  characterization,  and  propagation;  and  development  of  assessment
methods and products such as inundation maps with NOAA, FEMA, and other part-
ners.  USGS  will  also  continue  strong  partnerships  with  State  tsunami  and  earth-
quake  hazard  mitigation  groups  and  contribute  to  public  awareness  efforts.  An  ex-
ample  of  the  latter  is  the  2001  publication,  USGS  Circular  1187,  Surviving  a  Tsu-
nami:  Lessons  Learned  from  Chile,  Hawaii  and  Japan,  which  was  prepared  in  co-
operation with the Universidad Austral de Chile, University of Tokyo, University of
Washington,  Geological  Survey  of  Japan,  and  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Museum.  Con-
tinuing investigations of the Indian Ocean tsunami provide a critical opportunity to
expand  our  knowledge  of  tsunami  generation  and  impacts  and  to  evaluate  the  re-
search and operational requirements for effective hazard planning, warning, and re-
sponse systems.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Committee

and would be happy to answer any questions now or for the record.

BIOGRAPHY FOR CHARLES G. GROAT

On November 13, 1998, Dr. Charles G. Groat became the 13th Director of the U.S.

Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior.

Groat  is  a  distinguished  professional  in  the  Earth  science  community  with  over
25  years  of  direct  involvement  in  geological  studies,  energy  and  minerals  resource
assessment,  ground-water  occurrence  and  protection,  geomorphic  processes  and
landform  evolution  in  desert  areas,  and  coastal  studies.  From  May  to  November
1998, he served as Associate Vice President for Research and Sponsored Projects at

ciety  of  America,  American  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science,  American
Geophysical  Union,  and  the  American  Association  of  Petroleum  Geologists.  He  has
also served on over a dozen Earth science boards and committees and has authored
and  contributed  to  numerous  publications  and  articles  on  major  issues  involving
Earth resources and the environment.

Dr.  Charles  G.  Groat  was  born  in  Westfield,  New  York,  March  25,  1940.  He  cur-
rently  resides  in  Reston,  Virginia,  with  his  wife,  Barbara.  He  has  two  grown  chil-
dren.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much. It was the third ‘‘fi-

nally’’ that got me.
Dr. GROAT. Yeah.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Dr. GROAT. I got one ‘‘finally’’ ahead of myself. I am sorry.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, no, and it is very important, and you
know,  and  we  deal  with  some  of  the  most  sensitive  issues  of  our
time, and when we ask people to summarize in 300 seconds or less,
I  always  feel  that  we  sort  of  cheat  ourselves,  but  we  have  to  be
mindful of everybody’s schedule and everything else.

So thank you very much, Dr. Groat.
General Johnson.

STATEMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL DAVID L. JOHNSON (RE-
TIRED), DIRECTOR, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC
ADMINISTRATION’S NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
Brigadier General JOHNSON. Thank you, Chairman Boehlert and
Mr. Gordon and Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to
testify before you regarding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration,  NOAA,  activities  with  regard  to  the  tsunamis.  I
am  Brigadier  General  David  L.  Johnson,  the  Assistant  Adminis-
trator  for  Weather  Services,  and  the  Director  of  NOAA’s  National
Weather  Service.  And  I  ask  that  my  written  testimony  be  sub-
mitted for the record.

As  my  time  here  today  is  limited,  I  will  focus  my  oral  testimony
on  describing  the  U.S.  tsunami  program,  NOAA’s  response  to  the
Indian  Ocean  tsunami,  NOAA’s  role  in  the  Administration’s  tsu-
nami  warning  proposal,  and  how  the  United  States  can  help  the
world prepare for tsunamis.

The U.S. Tsunami Warning System consists of two warning cen-
ters,  the  Richard  H.  Hagemeyer  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center
in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, and the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warn-
ing Center in Palmer, Alaska.

The  Hagemeyer  Warning  Center  in  Hawaii  was  established  in
1949 in response to the unpredicted 1946 Aleutian tsunami, which
killed  165  of  our  citizens  on  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  The  1967  Alas-
ka Warning Center was created as a result of 120 deaths from the
1964 Great Alaska earthquake and tsunami that has already been
mentioned here today.

These  centers  are  responsible  for  issuing  all  tsunami  warning,
watch,  advisory,  and  information  messages  to  emergency  manager
officials and to the public. Now NOAA operates six Deep-ocean As-
sessment and Reporting of Tsunami, or DART, buoys to help issue
these accurate warnings. NOAA research activities developed these

buoys  to  measure  tsunamis  in  the  deep  ocean  and  to  transmit  the
information back to the Warning Centers. These instruments accu-
rately calculate the size of the tsunami by measuring the pressure
wave from the deep ocean floor as it passes, and tsunamis as small
as 0.5 centimeters have been measured.

In November of 2003, the DART buoys demonstrated their effec-
tiveness when a large earthquake occurred in the Aleutian Islands
and  generated  a  tsunami.  The  two  Warning  Centers  evaluated  the
tsunami and confirmed only a small wave. This accurate prediction
of the non-destructive tsunami saved Hawaii an estimated $68 mil-
lion in projected evacuation costs. The Hagemeyer Warning Center
also serves as the operational center for the International Tsunami
Warning  System  of  the  Pacific,  which  is  comprised  of  26  member
nations  around  the  Pacific  Rim.  The  Hagemeyer  Center’s  primary
responsibility is to issue tsunami warnings in the Pacific Basin for
tsunamis  that  can  cause  damage  far  away  from  their  source.  It  is
not the Center’s responsibility to issue local tsunami warnings from
seismic  events.  For  example,  if  an  earthquake  occurs  off  the  coast
of  Japan  and  a  local  tsunami  is  generated,  it  is  Japan’s  responsi-
bility to issue the local tsunami warning. However, the Hagemeyer
Center  will  warn  all  participating  nations  in  the  Pacific  Basin  if
the Japanese tsunami will cause damage.

NOAA’s  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  have  no  authority  or  respon-
sibility  to  issue  tsunami  warnings  for  the  Indian  Ocean  Basin.
However,  knowing  the  concerns  Pacific  countries  have  about  the
potential  damage,  on  Sunday,  the  26th  of  December,  2004,  at  8:14
p.m. Eastern Standard Time, and within seven minutes of notifica-
tion  and  15  minutes  of  the  Indonesian  earthquake,  both  centers
issued tsunami information bulletins.

Now  sea  level  gauges  are  also  essential  elements  of  the  current
Tsunami  Warning  System  in  the  Pacific.  When  strategically  lo-
cated,  they  can  also  be  used  to  quickly  confirm  the  existence  or
non-existence of tsunami waves following an earthquake to monitor
the tsunami’s progress and to help estimate the severity of the haz-
ard.

Unfortunately,  there  was  no  sea  level  data  or  other  information
available  to  substantiate  or  evaluate  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami
until hours after the earthquake had happened and when the first
news  reports  began  to  come  in  indicating  casualties  in  Sri  Lanka
and Thailand.

As  recently  announced  by  my  boss,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,
Under  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere,  the
United  States  is  now  committed  to  complete  the  current  Tsunami
Warning  System  for  the  United  States  by  2007.  NOAA’s  contribu-
tion  to  the  plan  includes  procuring  and  installing  32  new  DART
buoys,  including  25  in  the  Pacific  and  seven  in  the  Atlantic  and
Caribbean. In addition to the DART buoys, NOAA will procure and
install  38  new  sea  level  monitoring  and  tide  gauges,  and  the  Ad-
ministration  has  proposed  $24  million  to  NOAA  for  this  effort,  in-
cluding $18.1 million for the Pacific Basin and $5.9 million for the
Atlantic/Caribbean/Gulf.  With  that  expansion  of  the  U.S.  Tsunami
Warning  System,  NOAA  forecasters  will  be  better  able  to  protect
the United States 24/7 and will be able to alert communities within

the  warnings  are 

I agree education and outreach are key to ensure people take ap-
propriate  action  when 
issued.  NOAA’s
TsunamiReady  program  prepares  communities  to  learn  from  the
events  of  just  one  month  ago  and  to  ensure  we  educate  the  public
about potential impacts of tsunamis and to ensure every vulnerable
coast  community  is  TsunamiReady  certified.  I  solicit  your  help  to
make  this  happen.  We  are  prepared  to  export  this  important  pro-
gram to whomever needs it now.

With  global  attention  on  this  matter,  we  have  a  great  oppor-
tunity  to  help  the  world  better  prepare  for  tsunamis  through  the
development  of  a  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems,  or
GEOSS.  This  system  would  include  a  real-time  seismic  monitoring
network, a real-time DART network, and a real-time sea level mon-
itoring  network.  NOAA’s  Administrator,  Vice-Admiral  Conrad  C.
Lautenbacher, will be a member of the U.S. delegation at the Third
Earth Observation Summit taking place in Brussels this February.
He  will  ensure  the  development  of  a  global  tsunami  warning  sys-
tem is a high priority for the larger Global Earth Observation Sys-
tem of Systems.

We look forward to working with the Congress and other nations
around the world to help take the pulse of the planet and to make
our  world  a  safer  place.  And  I,  too,  am  happy  to  take  your  ques-
tions at the end.
Thank you, sir.
[The  prepared  statement  of  Brigadier  General  Johnson  follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID L. JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to
testify before you regarding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations
(NOAA)  activities  with  tsunamis.  I  am  Brigadier  General  (ret.)  David  L.  Johnson,
Assistant  Administrator  for  Weather  Services  and  Director  of  NOAA’s  National
Weather Service.

As  the  world  and  our  Nation  mourn  the  loss  of  life  from  the  Indian  Ocean  tsu-
nami tragedy, we recognize the very real threat of tsunamis and ask, ‘‘Could it hap-
pen  here?’’  We  need  to  be  able  to  answer  that  question  with  a  high  degree  of  con-
fidence.

We  know  a  tsunami  can  affect  any  community  along  the  coast  of  the  United
States.  This  is  particularly  true  for  the  Pacific  coast,  where  tsunamis  have  been
more  frequent.  The  recent  event  in  Southeast  Asia  and  Africa  highlights  the  need
to  address  the  steps  we  can  take  to  mitigate  the  potential  impact  of  such  an  event
here at home.

This  catastrophic  event  focuses  the  spotlight  on  the  threat  tsunamis  pose  to  all
coastal communities. If there is some good to come from this tragedy, it is the oppor-
tunity  that  we  now  have  to  educate  United  States  citizens  about  the  actions  they
should take if they receive a tsunami warning.

In this testimony, I will describe our existing tsunami warning program, including
a  brief  overview  of  our  work  with  the  International  community;  specific  actions
NOAA took during the recent tsunami; and then briefly outline the Administration’s
plan for developing a global tsunami warning system.

Tsunamis are natural disasters that can form in all of the world’s oceans and in-
land  seas,  and  in  any  large  body  of  water  near  seismic  activity.  Each  region  of  the
world  appears  to  have  its  own  cycle  of  frequency  and  pattern  for  generating
tsunamis  that  range  in  size  from  small  events  (no  hazards)  to  the  large  and  highly
destructive  events.  Eighty-five  percent  of  tsunamis  occur  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  and
its marginal seas. This is not surprising as the Pacific Basin covers more than one-
third of the Earth’s surface and is surrounded by a series of mountain chains, deep-
ocean trenches and island arcs called the ‘‘ring of fire.’’

Most  seismic  activity  occurs  in  this  ring  of  fire  where  the  main  tectonic  plates
forming the floor of the Pacific collide against one another or against the continental
plates that surround the ocean basin, forming subduction zones. While tsunamis can
be  generated  by  any  sudden  pressure  source  in  the  water,  such  as  a  meteor,  land-

slide,  etc.,  most  are  generated  from  earthquakes.  In  the  tropical  Pacific  tsunamis
tend to be modest in size. While tsunamis in these areas may be locally devastating,
their  energy  decays  rapidly  with  distance.  Usually  they  are  not  destructive  more
than  a  few  hundred  kilometers  away  from  their  sources.  That  is  not  the  case  with
tsunamis  generated  by  great  earthquakes  in  the  North  Pacific  or  along  the  Pacific
coast of South America. On the average of six times per century, a tsunami caused
by  an  earthquake  in  one  of  these  regions  sweeps  across  the  entire  Pacific  Ocean,
is  reflected  from  distant  shores,  and  sets  the  entire  ocean  in  motion  for  days.  Al-
though not as frequent, destructive tsunamis have also been generated in the Atlan-
tic  and  the  Indian  Oceans,  the  Mediterranean  Sea  and  even  within  smaller  bodies
of  water,  such  as  the  Sea  of  Marmara,  in  Turkey.  There  have  also  been  tsunamis
in  the  Caribbean,  but  the  lack  of  any  recent  tsunami  in  that  area  has  lowered  the
level of interest and hindered establishing a warning program in that area.

According  to  NOAA’s  National  historical  tsunami  databases,  during  the  105-year

period from 1900 to 2004:

at least ten caused widespread destruction throughout the Pacific.

• 923 tsunamis were observed or recorded in the Pacific Ocean.
• 120  tsunamis  caused  casualties  and  damage,  most  near  the  source.  Of  these,
• The greatest number of tsunamis during any one year was 23 in 1938. While
• There was no single year during this period that was free of tsunamis.
• 19  percent  of  all  tsunamis  were  generated  in  or  near  Japan;  nine  percent
were  generated  off  Alaska  and  the  west  coasts  of  Canada  and  the  United
States; and three percent were generated near Hawaii.

most were minor, one event did result in 17 deaths.

The  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System  consists  of  two  warning  centers:  the  Richard
H. Hagemeyer Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Ewa Beach, Hawaii; and
the  West  Coast/Alaska  Tsunami  Warning  Center  (WC/ATWC)  in  Palmer,  Alaska.
NOAA  conducts  research  on  tsunamis,  operates  essential  ocean  buoys  and  tide
gauges  to  detect  tsunamis,  and  works  with  other  Federal,  State,  local  government
agencies and universities as our partners in the tsunami warning mission.

The Richard H. Hagemeyer Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii was estab-
lished  in  1949  in  response  to  the  unpredicted  1946  Aleutian  tsunami,  which  killed
165  people  on  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  In  1967,  the  West  Coast/Alaska  Tsunami
Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, was created as a result of the 1964 Great Alas-
ka  earthquake  and  tsunami.  These  centers  are  responsible  for  issuing  all  tsunami
warning, watch, advisory, and information messages to emergency management offi-
cials  and  the  public  throughout  their  respective  areas  of  responsibility.  The  Pacific
Center covers United States interests and territories throughout the Pacific, includ-
ing  Hawaii,  while  the  West  Coast/Alaska  Center  covers  Alaska,  and  the  west  coast
of North America from British Columbia in Canada, to California.

About 100 water level gauges are used by the Tsunami Warning Centers and are
operated  by  the  Unites  States  and  our  international  partners.  These  gauges  are
along  the  coasts  of  islands  or  continents  around  the  Pacific  Rim.  NOAA  operates
many  of  these  stations,  including  33  from  NOAA’s  National  Water  Level  Observa-
tion  Network  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  basin,  which  are  equipped  with  software  to  sup-
port  the  Tsunami  Warning  System.  Water  levels  from  these  gauges  can  be  sent  di-
rectly  to  NOAA  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  and  others  who  want  the  information.
NOAA is working to upgrade the nationwide network with a real-time capability to
provide  a  continuous  stream  of  water  level  data  (minute-by-minute)  for  integration
with tsunami warning systems and research applications. NOAA also helps support
many coastal gauges located in other countries around the Pacific.

NOAA  operates  six  Deep-ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART)
buoys. NOAA research activities developed these buoys to measure tsunamis in the
deep  ocean  and  to  transmit  the  information  back  to  the  Warning  Centers  in  near
real  time.  These  instruments  accurately  calculate  the  size  of  the  tsunami  by  meas-
uring  the  pressure  it  exerts  on  the  deep  ocean  floor  as  the  wave  passes  over.
Tsunamis  as  small  as  0.5  cm  have  been  measured.  NOAA  began  placing  DART
buoys in the Pacific Ocean in 2002 and plans to have a complete coverage of poten-
tial Pacific tsunami source zones over the next few years.

In  November  2003,  the  buoys  demonstrated  their  effectiveness.  A  large  earth-
quake occurred in the Aleutian Islands and generated a tsunami. The two Tsunami
Warning  Centers  evaluated  the  tsunami  using  coastal  gauge  data  but  didn’t  ‘‘stand
down’’ until a reading arrived from the nearest DART buoy confirming only a small
tsunami. During post analysis of the event, DART data were used for a model sim-
ulation and the output from the simulation accurately predicted the two cm tsunami
recorded  at  Hilo,  Hawaii.  This  NOAA  model  is  still  being  developed,  but  an  initial

version  will  be  transferred  to  the  warning  centers  for  test  operations  this  year.
DART  data  and  the  forecast  model  show  much  promise  to  help  accurately  predict
tsunami  impacts.  In  the  history  of  Pacific  Warning  Center,  75  percent  of  its  warn-
ings  to  Hawaii  have  been  for  non-destructive  tsunamis.  The  DART  data  combined
with forecast models promise to significantly reduce false alarm rates as well as pro-
vide  a  better  measure  of  the  severity  of  destructive  tsunamis  for  Hawaii  and  all
other  parts  of  the  Pacific.  The  accurate  forecasting  of  a  non-destructive  tsunami  in
November 2003 saved Hawaii an estimated $68M in projected evacuation costs.

The Pacific Center also serves as the operational center for the International Tsu-
nami  Warning  System  of  the  Pacific,  which  is  comprised  of  26  member  nations  of
the Pacific Rim. These members share seismic and water level information with the
Pacific Center so the Center can determine whether a tsunami was generated in the
Pacific  Basin  and  assess  its  strength.  The  Pacific  Center’s  primary  responsibility  is
to issue tsunami warnings for Pacific Basin teletsunamis—tsunamis that can cause
damage far away from their source. It is not the Center’s responsibility to issue local
tsunami  warnings  from  seismic  events  outside  of  the  United  States.  For  example,
if  an  earthquake  occurs  off  the  coast  of  Japan  and  a  local  tsunami  is  generated,  it
is Japan’s responsibility to issue a local tsunami warning. However, it is the Pacific
Center’s  responsibility  to  warn  all  participating  nations  in  the  Pacific  Basin  if  the
Japanese tsunami will cause damage far from its source.

Only  Australia  and  Indonesia  have  coastlines  bordering  both  the  Pacific  and  In-
dian  Ocean  coasts.  None  of  the  other  countries  impacted  by  the  Indian  Ocean  tsu-
nami have coasts bordering the Pacific Ocean and therefore they do not receive tsu-
nami bulletins via the automated dissemination network.

Thailand  and  Indonesia  are  member  states  within  the  International  Tsunami
Warning  System  in  the  Pacific  (ITSU),  but  their  participation  has  been  limited.
Thailand has no coast along the Pacific, and Indonesia’s tsunami threat is primarily
outside  the  Pacific  Basin.  As  a  member  of  the  International  Coordination  Group
(ICG)  for  ITSU,  the  U.S.  has  actively  encouraged  non-member  States  to  become
ICG/ITSU members. Under the IGC/ITSU, the U.S. has actively supported the need
for  global  tsunami  mitigation  actions  and  will  continue  to  provide  support  through
the development of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), an ef-
fort  in  which  the  UNESCO  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission,  the  UN
International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction  (ISDR),  and  a  number  of  other  UN
agencies and programs participate.

NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers have no authority or responsibility to issue tsu-
nami  warnings  for  the  Indian  Ocean  basin.  However,  knowing  the  concern  Pacific
countries might have about the potential devastating impact a large earthquake and
resulting tsunami can inflict, on Sunday, 26 December 2004, at 8:14 p.m. EST, with-
in 15 minutes of the Indonesian earthquake, both centers issued Tsunami Informa-
tion Bulletins. These bulletins included location and initial magnitude (8.0) informa-
tion and an assessment that there was no tsunami threat in the Pacific. As the In-
dian  Ocean  is  outside  the  NOAA  tsunami  area  of  responsibility,  NOAA  Tsunami
Warning Centers have no procedures in place to issue a warning for this region. An
hour and five minutes after the earthquake, as additional information came in from
seismic  monitoring  stations  around  the  world,  another  bulletin  was  issued  by  both
Centers revising the magnitude of the earthquake to 8.5. This time the bulletin con-
tained a statement that the potential existed for a tsunami near the epicenter. Un-
fortunately,  there  was  no  sea-level  data  or  other  information  available  to  substan-
tiate or evaluate a tsunami until three and a half hours after the earthquake when
news  reports  began  coming  indicating  casualties  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Thailand.  At
about the same time, data from the one sea-level gauge in the Indian Ocean (Cocos
I; west of Australia) was received indicating a 45 cm peak-to-trough non-destructive
tsunami.

Sea-level  gauges  are  essential  elements  of  the  current  Tsunami  Warning  System
in the Pacific. When strategically located, they are used to quickly confirm the exist-
ence  or  non-existence  of  tsunami  waves  following  an  earthquake,  to  monitor  the
tsunami’s  progress,  and  to  help  estimate  the  severity  of  the  hazard.  There  was  no
data  available  from  the  Indian  Ocean  to  help  the  warning  centers  know  what  was
occurring.

An  effective  tsunami  warning  system  requires  (1)  an  assessment  of  the  tsunami
hazard,  (2)  near  real-time  seismic  and  oceanographic  (sea-level  change)  data;  (3)
high-speed data analysis capabilities; (4) a high-speed tsunami warning communica-
tion  system;  and  (5)  an  established  local  communications  infrastructure  for  timely
and  effective  dissemination  of  the  warning  and  evacuation  requirements.  It  is  also
critical that coastal populations are educated and prepared to respond appropriately
to tsunami warnings and calls for evacuations. For the Pacific Basin, these tsunami

41

warning  requirements  are  well  known.  Unfortunately,  for  the  Indian  Ocean  basin,
they were basically non-existent.

There  are  currently  six  DART  buoys  in  the  Pacific  operated  by  NOAA—three  off
the  coast  of  Alaska,  two  off  the  coast  of  the  western  U.S.,  and  one  in  the  eastern
Pacific. These first buoys of the currently envisioned 29 buoy array are an example
of  a  successful  transition  of  buoys  from  research  and  development  into  an  oper-
ational  system.  Three  of  the  deployed  DART  buoys  are  inoperable  and  will  be  re-
paired as soon as the weather permits.

The government of Chile purchased one DART buoys from NOAA and in now op-
erating off the northwest coast of Chile; another buoy is in the process of being pur-
chased at this time. Japan also operates a few cabled deep ocean sensors off its Pa-
cific coasts. The NOAA buoys represent the only current deep ocean capability avail-
able to the Tsunami Warning Centers to detect tsunamis. In July of last year, staff
from  the  Pacific  Center  had  discussions  with  Japanese  representatives  about  the
possibility of allowing PTWC access to data from the Japanese cabled buoys.

While  technical  equipment  is  required  for  detection  and  communication,  equally
important  are  continued  research  and  development,  and  education  and  outreach  to
mitigate potential impacts from tsunamis. People must have the knowledge and in-
formation  to  act  during  potentially  life  threatening  events.  Outreach  and  education
efforts,  such  as  NOAA’s  own  StormReady  and  TsunamiReady  programs,  are  key
components  of  the  U.S.  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP).
These  programs  foster  interaction  between  emergency  managers  and  their  citizens,
provide  robust  communications  systems,  and  establish  planning  efforts  before  cer-
tification.  NOAA  also  developed  multi-hazard  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment
training and decision support tools using GIS mapping technology to highlight popu-
lations,  infrastructure  and  critical  facilities  at  risk  for  coastal  hazards.  These  tools
and  other  support  are  critical  to  land  use  planning,  pre-disaster  planning,  mitiga-
tion  efforts,  and  targeted  dissemination  of  outreach,  education  and  information
about high-risk areas.

The  International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction  (ISDR)  was  launched  by  the
General  Assembly  of  the  United  Nations  to  provide  a  global  framework  for  action
to  reduce  human,  social,  economic,  and  environmental  losses  due  to  natural  and
man-made hazards. The ISDR aims at building disaster-resilient communities, high-
lighting  the  importance  of  disaster  reduction  as  an  integral  component  of  sustain-
able development. ISDR is the focal point within the United Nations system for co-
ordination  of  strategies  and  programs  for  disaster  reduction  and  to  ensure  synergy
between  disaster  reduction  activities  and  those  in  the  socioeconomic  and  humani-
tarian  fields.  One  particularly  important  role  of  ISDR  is  to  encourage  both  policy
and awareness activities by promoting national committees dedicated to disaster re-
duction and by working in close association with regional initiatives. As part of this
effort,  tsunami  hazard  maps  have  been  produced  for  over  300  coastal  communities
in over 11 countries, including 130 communities throughout the United States.

The United Nation’s Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO)
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) has developed products to help
countries implement tsunami response plans. Road signs and other mitigation prod-
ucts are available through the NTHMP (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami-hazard).
In  summary,  Tsunami  Response  Plans  are  probably  the  most  cost-effective  way  to
create  a  tsunami  resilient  community.  To  be  successful,  communities  must  remain
committed  to  a  continuous,  long-term  education  program.  Tsunamis  are  infrequent
events and it is important to ensure future generations understand tsunami safety.
Protecting  near-shore  ecosystems,  like  coral  reefs,  is  equally  important  for  main-
taining disaster-resilient communities. The international media and South Asian of-
ficials  reported  less  destruction  in  locations  protected  by  wave-absorbing  healthy
coral  reefs.  NOAA  and  our  federal,  State,  territorial,  and  international  partners
work to protect and preserve coral reef ecosystems.

The United States will continue working closely with the international community
to  help  implement  recommended  tsunami  detection  and  warning  measures  for  the
Indian Ocean Basin and other regions of the world currently without adequate tsu-
nami  warning  capability.  A  comprehensive  global  tsunami  warning  program  re-
quires deploying DART buoys along each of the world’s major subduction zones; add-
ing real-time sea-level monitoring/tide gauge stations; establishing Regional Centers
for Disaster Reduction, assessing hazards, promoting education and outreach efforts;
and conducting research and development.

As  recently  announced  by  Vice  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  Under  Secretary  of  Com-
merce  for  Oceans  and  Atmosphere,  the  Bush  Administration  has  a  plan  to  upgrade
the  current  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System.  NOAA’s  contribution  to  this  plan  in-
cludes procuring and installing 32 new DART buoys, including 25 new buoys in the
Pacific and seven new buoys for the Atlantic and Caribbean. We expect to have the

complete  network  of  DART  buoys  installed  and  operational  by  mid-2007;  20  buoys
should  be  operational  in  FY06,  with  the  final  12  in  place  in  FY07.  In  addition  to
the  DART  buoys,  NOAA  will  procure  and  install  38  new  sea  level  monitoring/tide
gauge stations. The Administration has allocated $24M, over the next two years, to
NOAA for this effort, including $18.1M for the Pacific Basin and $5.9M for Atlantic/
Caribbean/Gulf.

There  were  many  lessons  learned  from  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami.  A  key  point
to  make  is  that,  for  all  coastal  communities,  the  question  is  not  ‘‘if’’  a  tsunami  will
occur, but ‘‘when.’’ We know what causes a tsunami to develop, and we know a great
deal  about  how  to  track  them  and  forecast  their  path.  With  expansion  of  the  U.S.
Tsunami  Warning  System,  NOAA  forecasters  will  be  able  to  detect  nearly  100  per-
cent  of  tsunamis  affecting  the  United  States  and  will  be  able  to  respond  and  alert
communities  within  minutes  of  a  tsunami-producing  event.  With  expanded  edu-
cation  and  outreach  via  NOAA’s  TsunamiReady  program  and  other  efforts,  we  can
rest assured that our coastal communities have the opportunity to learn how to re-
spond to a tsunami event and that we have minimized the threat to American lives.
With  global  attention  on  this  important  matter,  we  have  a  great  opportunity  to
help  the  world  better  prepare  for  tsunamis  through  the  development  of  a  Global
Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS).  This  system  would  include  a  real-
time global seismic monitoring network, a real-time DART network, and a near real-
time  sea  level  monitoring  network.  NOAA  Administrator,  Vice-Admiral  Conrad  C.
Lautenbacher will be a member of the U.S. delegation at the Third Earth Observa-
tion  Summit  (February  16,  2005;  Brussels,  Belgium)  and  will  work  to  ensure  that
the development of a global tsunami warning system is a high priority for the larger
Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  and  the  Integrated  Ocean  Observing
System.

We  look  forward  to  working  with  Congress  and  other  nations  around  the  world
to  help  take  the  pulse  of  the  planet  and  make  our  world  a  safer  place.  Attached  to
this written testimony submitted for the record is an article published in the Inter-

BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID L. JOHNSON

David L. Johnson serves as the Assistant Administrator, National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA) for Weather Services (National Weather Service).
Johnson  heads  the  Nation’s  weather  service  and  is  responsible  for  the  day-to-day
management of NOAA’s domestic weather and hydrology operations.

Prior to joining NOAA, Johnson served as the U.S. Air Force director of weather.
He  retired  from  the  Air  Force  as  a  Brigadier  General,  after  a  30-year  military  ca-
reer.  As  Director  of  Weather,  he  was  one  of  ten  directors  at  the  Headquarters  Air
Force,  Air  and  Space  Operations,  and  was  responsible  for  developing  doctrine,  pol-
icy,  requirements  and  operational  organizations  to  support  Air  Force  and  Army  op-
erations worldwide. He also served as one of NOAA’s military deputies.

Notably, he organized, trained and equipped forces for the war in Afghanistan and
the war in Iraq, and managed a steady flow of accurate and focused environmental
information to battlefield commanders. He was a key advisor in the development of
the National Polar-orbiting Environmental Operational Satellite System (NPOESS).
Johnson’s career is marked by his strong management and fiscal capabilities. Dur-
ing  his  time  as  Director  of  Weather,  he  led  a  massive  re-engineering  effort  that  re-
vised  the  organizational  structure,  training  and  operations  of  the  4,000-person  ca-
reer field. Under Johnson’s steady hand, retention of weather-career airmen and of-
ficers grew to 97 percent, up from 74 percent previously.

Johnson  guided  the  planning,  programming  and  budgeting  process  implementa-
tion  at  the  highest  levels  in  the  Air  Force  and  in  the  Department  of  Defense.  He
has a worldwide perspective, having served in leadership positions on the Joint Staff
with  planning  portfolios  in  Europe/NATO  and  Asia/Pacific.  He  secured  funding  for
a  new  facility  for  the  Air  Force  Weather  Agency  to  house  collection,  analysis,  mod-
eling and career-field supervision functions.

Prior  to  his  service  as  the  Director  of  Weather,  Johnson  flew  fighter,  transport
and special operations aircraft. He has over 3,800 flying hours including 78 combat
sorties. Johnson commanded airdrop and air/land operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina
and  was  Deputy  Commander  of  the  Joint  Task  Force  for  Operation  Support  Hope
in Rwanda. He was selected for early promotion three times.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN A. ORCUTT, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, RE-
SEARCH AT THE SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY;
PRESIDENT, AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
Dr.  ORCUTT.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,
thank  you  very  much  for  inviting  me.  I  am  John  Orcutt,  Deputy
Director  of  Scripps  Institutions  of  Oceanography  and  President  of
the American Geophysical Union, the AGU.

On  the  26th  of  December  last  year,  a  1,200-kilometer  length  of
the  sea  floor  ruptured  during  the  Sumatra  earthquake.  The  rup-
ture  took  at  least  six  minutes  to  propagate,  breaking  rock  the  en-
tire  way.  The  earthquake  generated  a  devastating  tsunami,  but
there was no systematic warning distributed to coastal populations.
The event exceeded 500 megatons of explosives.

Adding  to  the  tragedy  is  our  knowledge  that  so  many  of  the
deaths could have been prevented if tsunami detection technologies
had  been  more  extensively  employed  and  at-risk  populations  had
been educated about how to react. The power of education is clear.
A colleague of mine, Chris Chapman, a British seismologist on holi-
day in Sri Lanka, understood the drastic rapid retreat of the ocean
from  the  beach  signaled  the  arrival  of  the  tsunami.  He  convinced
his  hotel  manager  to  get  on  the  beach  with  a  bullhorn  and  warn
people  to  direct  them  to  retreat  inland  or  to  higher  stories  of  the
hotel. Many lives were saved by Chris’s perception and persistence.
In a similar story involving, again, a Briton, a 10-year-old British
girl,  Tilly  Smith,  was  visiting  Thailand  with  her  parents.  Two
weeks  earlier,  she  had  done  a  school  project  on  tsunamis  and
earthquakes, and with this information alone, she was able to warn
and  save  more  than  100  lives.  Long  time  intervals  between
tsunamis, tens to hundreds of years, poses a great challenge to sus-
taining education efforts for the entire coastal populations.

In addition to education, of course, expansion of the Global Seis-
mic  Network,  the  GSN,  is  critical  to  detect  tsunamis  triggered  by
earthquakes.  With  more  seismic  stations,  we  can  more  readily  de-
termine  the  true  size  of  the  event  and  whether  the  event  is  deep
and  not  tsunamigenic  or  shallow  and  likely  to  have  caused  a  tsu-
nami.  With  a  comprehensive  network  of  seismic  stations,  the  im-
portant  surface  waves  from  an  earthquake  will  begin  to  arrive
about  seven  minutes  after  the  rupture  begins,  and  information
from  all  parts  of  the  fault  surface  will  be  available  after  about  13
minutes.

Once information from the fault surface has arrived, it is possible
to  compute  this  earthquake  source  mechanism  in  about  a  minute.
Taking  another  minute,  the  source  mechanism  can  be  propagated
to  determine  the  tsunami’s  path.  This  scenario  that  I  have  ex-
plained  of  15  minutes  is  really  very  optimistic,  because  a  tsunami
can travel at nearly 500 miles an hour. The real Sumatra tsunami
would  have  traveled  125  nautical  miles,  nearly  halfway  from  its

initial  break  to  Sumatra.  In  many  parts  of  the  world,  proximity  to
the  origin  of  the  tsunami  makes  warnings  almost  impossible.  In
these cases, an informed population is essential.

For  the  Caribbean,  enhancing  GSN  coverage  is  particularly  im-
portant.  The  Caribbean  Hispaniola  and  Puerto  Rico  trenches  are
sites  of  past  tsunamigenic  earthquakes  and  tsunamis  will  occur
there in the future. To avoid false warnings, false alarms, tsunami
model information must be verified using tide gauges and pressure
gauges.  If  several  of  these  had  been  installed,  for  example,  on  the
west  coast  of  Sumatra  and  telemetered  to  a  Warning  Center,  the
tsunami could have been verified well before it reached Sri Lanka,
India, Diego Garcia, the Maldives, and Africa.

I  have  mentioned  some  of  the  available  technologies  that  might
be deployed. Unfortunately, sustaining tsunami warning infrastruc-
ture  over  many  years  will  be  a  tremendous  challenge.  Even  in  the
Pacific,  tsunamis  do  not  occur  often.  Between  major  tsunamis,  the
NOAA  centers  have  always  had  a  hard  time  maintaining  their
budgets  and  personnel.  The  El  Nin˜ o  monitoring  array  has  funding
problems  even  though  El  Nin˜ o  occurs  every  three  to  seven  years
and everybody on the planet knows its affects.

The  Administration’s  proposed  Tsunami  Warning  System  would
deploy many single-purpose buoys. I am extremely concerned about
the ability to maintain such a system. I believe a more sustainable
approach  would  be  to  deploy  additional  shore-based  pressure
gauges and integrate the proposed NOAA system with the National
Science  Foundation’s  Ocean  Observatory  Initiative  (OOI)  plans  to
include  bottom  pressure  gauges  on  mid-ocean  buoys  that  serve  a
wide variety of disciplines.

The  OOI  also  includes  plans  for  sea  floor  seismic  observatories,
greatly  enhancing  the  densification  of  seismic  stations  I  discussed
earlier. And off the coast of Washington and Oregon, a planned ca-
bled  observatory  will  include  seismic  stations  and  bottom  pressure
gauges  to  form  a  dense  tsunami  observatory  network.  The  OOI  is
expected  in  the  President’s  fiscal  year  2006  request  for  the  NSF.
The Administration’s plan recommends 24/7/365 operation of the
National  Earthquake  Information  Center  satellite  telemetry  to  the
entire  GSN  and  increasing  station  coverage.  I  strongly  support
these recommendations. Furthermore to have the greatest efficacy,
data should be openly available.

Unfortunately,  today,  current  operations  and  maintenance  fund-
ing  of  $5  million  a  year,  $2  million  from  the  NSF  and  $3  million
from  the  Geological  Survey  for  the  GSN,  is  not  adequate.  As  a  re-
sult,  GSN  is  deteriorating  and  requires  an  additional  $5  million  a
year based on several studies in the IRS and USGS.

Because  the  Tsunami  Warning  System  will  need  to  be  main-
tained  in  perpetuity,  we  must  develop  strategic  knowledge  about
high-risk  tsunami  areas  to  lower  long-term  costs.  In  order  to  ac-
complish this, NOAA and the Geological Survey’s Tsunami Hazard
Mapping  efforts  should  be  expanded  and  detailed  asymmetry  sur-
veys  should  be  undertaken  to  identify  important  slumps  for  moni-
toring.

We must also explore the development of cheap monitoring tech-
nology,  exploring  the  Global  Positioning  System,  or  GPS,  using
ocean  buoys  and  ships  is  an  interesting  alternative  to  pressure

gauges  to  verify  a  tsunami.  Horizontal  tsunami  motion  would  be
detectable from a buoy or even a ship underway, and costs may be
lower using that technology.

As  President  of  AGU,  I  was  asked  by  the  U.N.  Environmental
Program  to  write  a  brief  report  proposing  an  Indian  Ocean  Tsu-
nami  Warning  System.  This  report  is  not  complete,  but  it  will  in-
clude  a  number  of  approaches,  including  increasing  the  number  of
GSN  stations,  developing  a  Tsunami  Warning  Center  or  Centers
for  the  region,  improving  telemetry  to  the  stations  in  between  the
center  of  the  many  states  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  exploiting  modern
grid-based  cyberinfrastructure  and  installing  a  large  number  of
telemetered  pressure  gauges,  and  installing  communications  need-
ed to distribute a tsunami warning to the public.

The  location  and  magnitude  of  the  26th  of  December  Sumatra
earthquake  was  determined  in  time  for  mitigating  measures  to  be
taken  in  Sri  Lanka,  India,  the  Maldives,  and  Africa  to  prevent  ex-
tensive  loss  of  life.  The  lack  of  infrastructure  to  warn  people  was,
unfortunately, the weak link in the system.

Thank  you,  again,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Com-

mittee. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Orcutt follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN A. ORCUTT

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you very much for inviting
me  to  testify.  I  am  John  Orcutt,  Deputy  Director  of  Scripps  Institution  of  Oceanog-
raphy (SIO) at University of California at San Diego (UCSD), Director of the UCSD
Center  for  Earth  Observations  and  Applications,  and  President  of  the  American
Geophysical  Union  or  AGU.  The  AGU  has  more  than  44,000  members  worldwide.
Nearly  every  scientist  involved  in  tsunami  studies  in  any  country  in  the  world  is
likely a member of the AGU.

Over  the  last  sixty  years,  SIO  scientists  have  played  a  substantial  role  in  under-
standing tsunamis. In 1947, Professor Walter Munk, a continuously active scientist/
oceanographer,  developed  and  installed  the  first  tsunami-recording  instrument.  In
1949,  Dr.  Gaylord  Miller,  Walter’s  student,  was  named  the  first  director  of  what  is
now  NOAA’s  Tsunami  Warning  Center  in  Hawaii.  Dr.  Bill  Van  Dorn,  another  of
Walter’s  students,  was  the  real  pioneer  at  Scripps  in  understanding  and  popular-
izing knowledge of tsunami.

Scripps  continues  its  tsunami  work  through  the  operation  of  approximately  one-
third of the Global Seismic Network (GSN), pressure gauges, the study of slope fail-
ure and initiation in submarine landslides, and the development of sensitive instru-
mentation to understand triggering mechanisms of submarine landslides.
What is Scripps’ role in the worldwide seismic network? When did Scripps
know  about  the  earthquake  on  December  26,  2004  and  what  was
your response?

With National Science Foundation (NSF) funding, Scripps operates and maintains
40 Project IDA (International Deployment of Accelerometers) GSN stations. Scripps
is also responsible for data telemetry (transferring data immediately via phone line,
cable, or satellite), quality control, and distribution of data to researchers worldwide
via the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Management
System.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  operates  the  remaining  two-thirds  of  the  GSN.
In 1975, Scripps Project IDA pioneered modern global digital seismic networks by
deploying  a  network  of  high  performance  instruments,  the  forerunner  of  today’s
GSN.  Cecil  Green,  founder  of  Texas  Instruments,  provided  funding  for  the  project
and the NSF provided funds to maintain the network.

In  1984,  the  extraordinary  scientific  results  gleaned  from  data  recorded  by  that
early network and a parallel evolution in electronics technology led to the formation
of IRIS and the associated GSN, with Scripps’ IDA stations at the core of the fledg-
ling network. With NSF support and continuing support from the Green Foundation
for  Earth  Sciences,  the  GSN  modernized  the  original  IDA  instruments  and  ex-
panded  the  scope  of  the  global  network.  Scripps  continues  to  operate  some  of  the
original global stations, making IDA the longest operating digital global seismic net-

work  in  history.  The  digital  recording  instrumentation  and  high  performance  char-
acteristics of the seismometers pioneered at SIO/UCSD are essential elements of the
earthquake  and  tsunami  warning  systems  in  existence  today.  Because  Scripps  is
usually  tasked  with  deploying  global  seismic  stations  at  the  most  difficult  sites,  all
of the Indian Ocean seismic stations and many on the direct periphery are SIO/IDA
observatories (See Figure 1).

Data telemetered from thirty IDA stations are immediately and automatically for-
warded  by  computer  to  the  USGS  National  Earthquake  Information  Center  (NEIC)
in Golden, Colorado and the NOAA tsunami warning centers in Hawaii and Alaska.
Those  organizations  constantly  monitor  these  and  other  data  streams  for  earth-
quake signals. Due to their proximity to the event, IDA stations were critical in the
early detection of the December 26th earthquake. The two closest global seismic sta-
tions,  IDA  stations  on  Cocos  (Keeling)  Island  (Figure  2)  and  Sri  Lanka  (Figure  3),
received  signals  three  minutes,  thirty  seconds  after  the  quake  began.  Data  from
these and other IDA GSN stations in the region were used by the NEIC, and other
civil, academic, and military systems to quickly determine the quake’s size and loca-
tion (Figure 4).

Scripps  personnel  do  not  constantly  review  incoming  data.  Scripps  staff  first
learned of the quake at 6:16 PM PST (one hour seventeen minutes after the earth-
quake) when they received notice via automatic e-mail from the NEIC of the initial
earthquake detection. SIO also received an inquiry from the IDA/Sri Lanka operator
at 6:57 PM (one hour fifty-eight minutes after the quake) asking whether there had
been any earthquakes in or near Sri Lanka. The operator had received many phone
calls  from  local  residents  who  had  felt  tremors  and  wanted  to  know  the  source.
SIO’s  analyst  replied  at  7:13  PM  with  information  about  the  NEIC  announcement
of  the  earthquake  and  a  plot  of  the  seismic  waves  recorded  by  the  IDA  station  in
Sri Lanka.
What are all of the elements of an adequate tsunami warning system? Does

the U.S. warning system currently contain all these elements?

The Global Seismic Network (GSN) is critical to tsunami detection associated with
earthquakes.  The  recent  Sumatra  earthquake  substantially  displaced  the  seafloor
causing a tsunami with displacements throughout the water column. Smaller events
can  also  excite  tsunami  via  a  major  underwater  landslide  triggered  by  an  earth-
quake.  For  example,  on  November  18,  1929,  a  7.2  magnitude  offshore  earthquake
triggered  the  Grand  Banks  Tsunami.  The  earthquake  caused  200  cubic  kilometers
of  sediment  to  shift,  breaking  twelve  transatlantic  communications  cables.  Twenty-
seven  people  died  in  the  tsunami  and  the  tsunami  run  up  was  as  great  as  twenty-
seven  meters.  More  than  forty  villages  were  affected  and  homes,  ships,  and  fishing
gear  were  lost.  The  tsunami  also  damaged  the  seabed  leading  to  poor  fish  catches
through much of the Great Depression.

The  1200-kilometer  length  of  seafloor  ruptured  in  the  Sumatra  earthquake.  The
rupture  took  at  least  six  minutes  to  propagate,  breaking  rock  the  entire  way.  Six-
teen  minutes  after  the  earthquake  began,  the  NEIC  estimated  a  6.2  magnitude
earthquake. The low estimate was not because of any system or human malfunction,
but because limited information was available (Figure 2).

When a large earthquake occurs, the seismogram appears differently when viewed
from different directions. If the fault breaks toward the station, the sum of the rup-

49

ture  velocity  and  the  wave  propagation  velocity  will  make  the  event  appear  to  be
compressed  in  time.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  rupture  front  propagates  away  from
the  seismic  station,  the  two  speeds  will  combine  to  lengthen  the  seismogram  in
time.  To  fully  understand  the  magnitude  of  a  great  earthquake,  seismic  stations
with high fidelity must be available from as many directions as possible. The higher
the density of seismic stations, the more rapidly one can determine the accurate size
of  the  event  and  whether  the  event  is  deep  and  not  tsunamigenic,  or  shallow  and
likely  to  have  caused  a  tsunami.  In  a  relatively  perfect  world,  with  a  large  number
of seismic stations 15° away from a great earthquake on Earth’s surface, the impor-
tant surface waves will begin to arrive about seven minutes after the rupture begins
and information from all parts of the fault surface will be available after about thir-
teen  minutes.  While  it  would  be  impractical  to  deploy  this  array  of  stations  world-
wide, it would be possible to have the necessary coverage in high-risk areas. If com-
putation can be speeded to determine the initial fault mechanism in a minute’s time
(the actual computational challenge is modest), fourteen minutes would be the min-
imum  time  needed  to  develop  a  full  understanding  of  the  earthquake  source.  Be-
cause of the sparse distribution of high-quality seismic stations around the Sumatra
earthquake,  what  is  theoretically  possible  in  fourteen  minutes  took  considerably
longer.

With  a  comprehensive  network  of  seismic  arrays,  once  an  earthquake  source
mechanism is known, certainly no earlier than fourteen to fifteen minutes after the
earthquake  begins,  the  source  mechanism  can  be  coupled  to  a  model  that  forecasts
the path of the tsunami from the earthquake location to islands and continents. Be-
cause  a  tsunami  in  average  ocean  depth  travels  at  200m/s  (nearly  500  mph),  the
real Sumatra tsunami would have traveled 125 nautical miles, or 142 statute miles,
nearly  half  way  from  the  initial  break  to  Banda  Aceh  on  Sumatra.  Time  would  be
running out for many even in this idealized case.

The  existence  of  a  tsunami  associated  with  a  suspect,  large  earthquake  can  be
verified  in  a  number  of  ways.  Tide  gauges  and  especially  pressure  gauges  are  very
helpful  in  this  regard.  Pressure  gauges  are  simple,  inexpensive  sensors  that  last
decades.  Figure  5  shows  a  record  of  a  pressure  gauge  sampled  each  second  at  the
end of the Scripps pier. This records the Sumatra tsunami thirty-six hours after the
earthquake  and  shows  a  peak-to-peak  amplitude  of  about  twelve  centimeters  (four
inches). Surprisingly, this is the only pressure gauge on the west coast that samples
at this high frequency. If several of these had been installed and telemetered on the
west coast of Sumatra, the gauges would have been able to verify the tsunami well
before it reached Sri Lanka, India, Diego Garcia and the Maldives. Technically and
financially,  the  installation  and  operation  of  these  gauges  is  not  a  major  challenge.
NOAA has experimented for some years with pressure gauges on the seafloor tended
by  telemetering  buoys  overhead—the  principle  is  the  same  as  the  pressure  gauge
in  Figure  5.  In  the  President’s  recently  announced  program,  NOAA  proposes  to  in-
stall a number of these DART buoys around the world.

The instrumentation described above summarizes the science and technology nec-
essary  to  detect  a  tsunami.  The  greater  challenges  to  a  tsunami  warning  system,
however,  are  socio-political  and  involve  distributing  information  to  those  at  risk  as
well  as  long-term  educational  efforts  for  entire  coastal  populations.  Currently,  tsu-
nami-warning  centers  exist  only  for  the  Pacific  through  NOAA  and  the  NEIC
through the USGS. There are no warning centers for the Indian, Atlantic or Carib-
bean oceans.

The power of education is clearly stated by Dr. Chris Chapman, a close colleague
on  holiday  in  Sri  Lanka  with  his  wife  during  the  tsunami.  Dr.  Chapman,  a  British
seismologist, understood that the drastic, rapid retreat of the ocean from the beach
signaled  the  arrival  of  a  tsunami.  He  and  his  wife  convinced  their  hotel  manager
to  use  his  bullhorn  to  warn  everyone  to  retreat  inland  or  to  the  higher  stories  of
the hotel. Many lives were saved by Chris’ perception and persistence.

In a recent article from AGU’s newspaper, EOS, Dr. Chapman states:

Given the time and distances, there was little we could have done for the neigh-
boring villages. Would an early warning system have helped? Of course, but the
situation in the Indian Ocean is very different from the Pacific: The recurrence
rate  is  very  low  (There  appear  to  be  no  recent  historical  events;  locals  spoke
of  a  tsunami  more  the  2000  years  ago,  although  I  have  been  unable  to  check
this.  With  a  recurrence  rate  longer  than  a  generation,  how  would  people  have
reacted?  We  had  40  minutes  of  warning  and  still  did  not  behave  in  the  most
logical fashion); the distances and hence warning times are less than in the Pa-
cific;  and  some  of  the  countries  surrounding  the  Indian  Ocean  have  fragile  in-
frastructures at best. But given that an early warning system is technically rel-
atively  straightforward  and  inexpensive,  of  course  it  should  be  installed.  Per-
haps it can be used as a catalyst and driving force for improvements to the local
infrastructures rather than just being imposed from outside.

A  ten-year-old  girl  British  girl,  Tilly  Smith,  was  visiting  Thailand  with  her  par-
ents.  Two  weeks  earlier  she  had  done  a  class  project  on  earthquakes  and  tsunami

and was able to save more than a hundred people because she recognized the warn-
ing signs of an impending tsunami.
What  are  the  greatest  challenges  to  improving  the  U.S.  tsunami  detection
and  warming  systems?  What  is  your  opinion  of  the  Administra-
tion’s  new  proposal  to  improve  the  U.S.  tsunami  warning  system?
Are  there  other  activities  or  actions  that  the  plan  should  have  in-
cluded? If so, what are they?

Sustaining  tsunami-warning  infrastructure  over  many  years  is  the  greatest  chal-
lenge. For the past thirty-two years as an observational scientist, I have developed,
deployed  and  been  responsible  for  the  maintenance  of  numerous  research  facilities.
Maintaining observing platforms is incredibly difficult, especially when events occur
infrequently.

In  the  case  of  tsunamis,  major  events  occur  at  time  scales  from  decades  to  cen-
turies.  Even  in  the  Pacific,  tsunamis  do  not  occur  often.  Between  major  tsunamis,
the  NOAA  Center  in  Honolulu  always  has  a  hard  time  maintaining  its  budget  and
hiring qualified personnel. The El Nin˜ o monitoring array has funding problems even
though  an  El  Nin˜ o  occurs  every  three  to  seven  years  and  everyone  on  the  planet
is aware of its effects.

The  Administration’s  proposed  tsunami  warning  system  would  deploy  many  sin-
gle-purpose buoys. I am extremely concerned about the ability and willingness of the
United  States  to  maintain  such  a  system.  Initial  system  costs  are  not  particularly
high; however, annual operations and maintenance costs will equal the initial costs
within three to four years when the cost of ship time needed to service buoys is in-
cluded.

I  believe  a  more  sustainable  approach  would  be  to  deploy  additional  shore-based
pressure  gauges  and  integrate  the  proposed  NOAA  system  with  NSF  plans  to  in-
clude  bottom  pressure  gauges  on  mid-ocean  buoys  that  serve  a  wide  variety  of  dis-
ciplines. NSF’s Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) plans include deployment of seven
to  twelve  buoys  capable  of  multidisciplinary  measurements,  such  as  seafloor  pres-
sure  for  tsunami  detection  and  sea  level  rise.  The  OOI  also  includes  plans  for
seafloor seismic observatories of a quality equal to those on land—this would greatly
enhance  the  recommended  densification  of  seismic  stations  I  discussed  earlier.  For
the Northeast Pacific, a planned cabled observatory offshore will include seismic sta-
tions  as  well  as  bottom  pressure  gauges  to  form  a  dense  tsunami  observatory  net-
work as well as providing the infrastructure for observations relevant to climate, life
in  extreme  environments,  physical  oceanographic  and  biological  observations  in  the
California current, and coastal sediment dynamics.

Expansion of the Global Seismic Network is necessary to reduce tsunami detection
times,  at  least  for  tsunamis  associated  with  earthquakes  and  volcanoes  which  are
the  vast  majority  in  terms  of  numbers.  The  137-station  GSN  is  too  sparse  for  the
purposes of global tsunami detection. More stations are needed to understand quick-
ly an earthquake’s source and its potential to create a tsunami. Furthermore, these
additional  stations  will  serve  a  wide  variety  of  purposes:  global  earthquake  hazard
studies, detection and identification of nuclear tests, fault mechanics research, seis-
micity,  and  Earth  structure  from  the  inner  core  to  the  planet’s  crust.  This  broad
range  of  scientific  and  societal  uses  will  help  to  ensure  the  system  is  maintained.
For the Caribbean, enhancing GSN coverage is particularly important. The Carib-
bean  Hispaniola  and  Puerto  Rico  trenches  are  sites  of  past  tsunamigenic  earth-
quakes and will cause future tsunami. Many of the Caribbean’s islands are close to
these  trenches  and  the  impact  of  a  tsunami  could  be  devastating.  Steep  slopes
around the trenches also increase the likelihood of earthquake-triggered underwater
landslides  in  this  region.  In  1998,  such  an  earthquake-triggered  landslide  killed
2000  people  in  Aitape  on  the  north  coast  of  Papua  New  Guinea.  Within  the  Gulf
of  Mexico,  submarine  landslide  hazards  are  substantial  although  not  known  to  be
tsunamigenic.  British  Petroleum  is  funding  Scripps  to  develop  deep  seafloor  instru-
mentation capable of monitoring seafloor movement and landslide initiation. We are
currently  testing  these  instruments  at  a  major  slump  in  southern  California,  the
Goleta slump (Figure 6).

The President’s plan recommends 24/7/365 operation of the NEIC and establishing
satellite telemetry to the entire GSN. I strongly support the recommendation to en-
hance  the  quality  of  NEIC  and  the  satellite  telemetry  will  minimize  the  time  from
event  to  source  identification.  Currently,  in  some  cases,  seismic  station  telemetry
piggybacks  on  a  UN  satellite  system  operated  by  the  UN  Comprehensive  Test  Ban
Treaty  Organization  (CTBTO);  development  and  testing  of  this  system  was  done  at
Scripps. Following the Sumatra earthquake, the system was saturated with CTBTO
traffic and some of the GSN shared circuits were blocked by this priority traffic. Be-
cause  the  data  at  the  CTBTO  are  not  available  publicly,  it  is  important  to  move
from  this  system  as  soon  as  possible.  Furthermore,  to  have  the  greatest  efficacy,
data should be openly available to all agencies, governments, and individuals inter-
ested  in  monitoring  and  processing  data.  For  the  Indian  Ocean  specifically,  moving
to a satellite telemetry system would immediately resolve data dependability issues
with the Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Seychelles stations. (Figure 7)

Another GSN issue is how the network is currently funded. NSF provides the sup-
port  for  a  third  of  the  GSN  and,  through  IRIS,  manages  data  quality  control,
archiving,  and  distribution  of  all  data.  The  NSF  has  provided  all  the  capital  costs
for  the  GSN  stations  including  those  operated  and  maintained  by  the  USGS.  The
President’s  plan  for  a  tsunami  warning  system  does  not  recognize  NSF’s  role  and
does  not  include  an  augmentation  of  the  NSF  budget  for  GSN  growth  and  mod-
ernization.

Finally, current funding of $5 million per year ($2 million NSF/$3 million USGS)
for  the  GSN  is  inadequate.  As  a  result,  GSN  is  deteriorating  and  requires  an  addi-
tional  $5  million  per  year  for  operations  and  maintenance.  IRIS  has  established,
through a series of studies, that GSN O&M costs range from $60,000 to $75,000 per
year  per  station  in  1998  dollars.  Therefore,  the  costs  to  maintain  the  GSN  are  $8
to $10 million per year.

The  NOAA/USGS  tsunami  hazard  mapping  efforts  should  be  expanded.  In  the
case  of  earthquake-caused  tsunami  and  volcanoes,  this  is  fairly  straightforward.
Earthquake  probabilities  could  be  coupled  to  tsunami  models,  which  would  include
the  best  offshore  bathymetry  data  available.  Tsunami  run-up  could  be  estimated
from the best available topographic maps. At a minimum, topography data from the
U.S. Shuttle Radar Topography Mapping (SRTM) at 30-meter postings are available
globally; better data are often available from other unclassified resources. The inter-
section of high probability tsunami run-up estimates with data about population and
economic  centers  would  provide  guidelines  for  monitoring  requirements;  for  exam-
ple,  where  pressure  gauges  should  be  installed.  Tsunami  risk  assessment  can  then
be  used  to  prioritize  more  detailed  topography  and  bathymetry  surveys.  Further-
more,  governments  can  use  the  knowledge  for  civil  works  planning,  as  is  done  now
in the U.S. and especially in California for earthquake hazards.

Hazard  mapping  for  non-earthquake  related  submarine  landslides  is  more  com-
plex.  Detailed  bathymetry  surveys  can  identify  important  slumps  for  monitoring
(Figure  8).  Continued  research  in  the  causes  and  development  of  new  monitoring
technologies  are  important  for  understanding  their  role  in  tsunami  and  should  be
accelerated.

While  pressure  gauges  on  the  seafloor  are  well  understood,  exploiting  the  Global
Positioning System (GPS) using ocean buoys and ships is an interesting tsunami de-
tection alternative not requiring communications with the seafloor. Horizontal reso-
lution  with  errors  less  than  three  centimeters  has  been  achieved  on  Scripps  ships.
While  GPS  vertical  resolution  is  generally  five  to  ten  times  poorer  than  horizontal,
obviating the detection of passing tsunami in deep water, the horizontal motions are
substantially larger than the vertical displacements. The horizontal tsunami motion
should be detectable from a buoy or a ship underway. Research should be conducted
to  investigate  this  approach  for  verifying  a  tsunami  at  sea  as  costs  may  well  be
lower than the pressure gauge alternative.

A global tsunami warning system requires reliable global communications and ef-
fective  collaboration  among  many  states.  In  the  past  these  exchanges  occurred  by
telephone, radio, and, with increasing frequency, e-mail. Moore’s Law; after Gordon
Moore, founder of Intel, is often used to quantify the exponential growth of the num-
ber  of  transistors  on  a  chip.  Generally,  this  number  doubles  every  eighteen  months
and computing speed follows not far behind. Less well known is the rate of doubling
of  network  speed,  approximately  nine  months  and  digital  storage,  twelve  months.
Clearly  both  network  speed  and  memory  are  outstripping  increases  in  computa-
tional capability. In five years time, for example, computer-processing capability will
increase  by  a  factor  of  ten,  memory  density  by  thirty-two,  and  network  bandwidth
by  100.  Today  network  speeds  of  10Gbps  (a  Gbps  is  a  gigabit  per  second  where  a
gigabit  is  a  billion  bits  of  data)  are  available  in  academia  and  connect  a  number
of  locations  in  the  U.S.  using  networks  such  as  the  National  Lambda  Rail  (NLR)
and  these  speeds  extend  to  Japan,  Europe,  Korea,  and  Australia  through  inter-
national  projects  such  as  NSF’s  Pacific  Rim  Applications  and  Grid  Middleware  As-
sembly (PRAGMA).

It is no longer necessary or even desirable to centralize computing, data archives,
visualization  tools,  and  real-time  sensor  networks  because  of  the  tremendous  net-
working  speeds  available  now  and  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  this  growth  trans-
lates into exponential decreases in cost for a constant capability. That is, a terabyte
of  storage  today  costs  approximately  $900  (a  terabyte  is  1,000,000,000,000  char-
acters). In five years, $900 will purchase 32 TB of storage. Cyberinfrastructure grids
connecting  nodes  for  computation,  visualization,  sensorwebs,  and  storage  must  be
exploited to create the global tsunami warning system to maximize capability while
minimizing  costs.  The  G–8’s  Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS)
is an excellent candidate for coordinating this effort.
How  would  you  recommend  that  an  Indian  Ocean  and  worldwide  tsunami
warning network be established? What role should the U.S. play in
its development?

As President of the AGU, I was asked by the United Nations Environmental Pro-
gramme to write a brief report proposing an Indian Ocean tsunami warning system.
This  report  is  not  complete  but,  when  finished,  will  include  a  number  of  the  ap-
proaches  outlined  above.  In  particular,  it  will  recommend  increasing  the  number  of
GSN stations in and around the Indian Ocean; developing a tsunami warning center
or  centers  for  the  region;  improving  the  telemetry  to  the  various  stations  and  be-

tween the center and the many states in the Indian Ocean; the installation of a sub-
stantial  number  of  telemetered  pressure  gauges;  and  the  technology  needed  to  in-
form  threatened  States,  local  governments  and  private  citizens  of  impending  tsu-
nami  disasters.  Education  and  outreach  are  critically  important  to  teach  children
and  adults  about  the  dangers  and  signs  of  tsunamis.  Tsunami  hazards  mapping
must  be  started  as  soon  as  possible  to  determine  where  additional  sensors,  such  as
buoys with GPS and/or pressure gauges, should be installed and maintained.

The  cyberinfrastructure  discussed  in  the  previous  section  can  be  very  helpful  in
meeting local needs. For example, at the request of the government of the Maldives,
we  quickly  established  a  web  page  showing  the  real-time  seismic  data  from  the
three  GSN  stations  closest  to  the  Sumatra  event.  It  is  possible  for  people  on  the
Maldives  to  monitor  for  aftershocks—an  issue  of  significant  concern  given  the  very
low  island  freeboard  for  nearly  all  of  these  islands.  It  should  be  possible  for  inter-
ested  parties  to  set  up  similar  virtual  observatories  for  their  specific  needs  without
outside help if the grid architecture for global services is adopted.

The location and magnitude of the December 26th Sumatra earthquake was deter-
mined in time for mitigating measures to be taken in Sri Lanka, India, the Maldives
and  Africa  to  prevent  extensive  loss  of  life.  The  lack  of  civil  infrastructure  to  warn
people was, unfortunately, the weak link in the system. The development of tsunami
warning in this area of the world will have to be comprehensive in nature.

Dr.  LERNER-LAM.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Gordon,  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity
to provide testimony on such an important matter facing us today.
This  committee,  of  course,  has  long  been  a  supporter  of  basic
science and research in the United States, and this support has en-
abled  many  of  us  to  participate  in  the  discussions  of  the  Tsunami
Warning System to talk about the role that basic science has in de-

veloping such systems and to talk about the role that basic science
plays in protecting the population and our societies.

My  comments  today,  I  am  a  seismologist  at  the  Lamont-Doherty
Earth  Observatory.  I  am  also  Director  of  the  Center  for  Hazards
and  Risk  Research.  As  a  seismologist,  I  share  many  of  the  com-
ments  that  Dr.  Orcutt  made.  As  a  Director  of  a  center  that  is  con-
cerned  with  the  use  of  this  information  to  protect  populations,  my
comments  today  will  be  oriented  toward  how  we  should  perceive
the  risk  of  tsunamis  in  the  presence  of  other  natural  hazards  and
risks.

[Slide.]
My  first  slide  shows  this  tsunami  to  be  an  extreme  event.  The
number  of  deaths  as  of  last  Thursday  in  the  South  Asian  tsunami
is well over 200,000, but you can see that persistent tsunamis, par-
ticularly  in  the  Pacific,  and  in  some  cases,  the  Indian  Ocean,  also
killed tens of thousands of people.

In some sense, these are extreme events in that they have an ex-
treme  impact  and  are  outside  of  our  experience.  In  another  sense,
some of the generative events, some of the events that cause these
tsunamis,  can  be  forecast  in  ways  that  pertain  to  our  under-
standing of basic science.

We have attempted to do this with a basket of natural disasters,
including  droughts,  earthquakes,  landslides,  floods,  severe  storms,
and other disasters, and earthquakes. The point of a map like this
is  to  show  that  the  world  is,  indeed,  a  dangerous  place,  that  there
are  areas  in  the  world  that  have  persistent  hydrometeorological
and geophysical impacts from disasters and that the United States,
on a global basis, luckily suffers relatively low mortality.

But  in  terms  of  economic  risks,  the  United  States  has  a  severe
exposure.  And  again,  these  exposures  to  a  basket  of  hazards  are
significant.

this  sort, 

the
hydrometeorological disasters, that is the floods and the storms, as
well  as  the  geophysical  disasters,  the  landslides  and  the  earth-
quakes,  are  decent  proxies  for  what  might  be  expected  if  a  severe
tsunami impacted the United States.

in  a  slide  of 

Now  in  some  sense,  a  calculation  of  this  sort  is  an  annualized
calculation. This is what we would expect from the normal physics
of  the  Earth.  On  the  other  hand,  we  are  faced  with  the  events  of
December  26,  which  is,  in  reality,  extreme.  And  these  are  extreme
events  for  which  we  really  do  not  have  good  statistics.  We  simply
don’t have a long enough instrumental record.

In this case, how do we approach the risk? I think there are two
approaches. We need to persist in our understanding of the events
that  happen  all  of  the  time  and  to  develop  systems  that  allow  us
to  mitigate  the  impact  of  those  events,  both  for  the  Nation  and
globally.  But  we  also  must  take  a  precautionary  approach  towards
these  extreme  events,  especially  when,  like  the  current  Tsunami
Warning  System,  the  cost  of  setting  a  system  are  low,  relative  to
the enormous impacts that might occur.

Elements  of  a  Tsunami  Warning  System  that  should  be  consid-
ered by this committee have been touched on by some of the other
testimony, but I will reiterate some of these points.

[Slide.]
I  would  point  out 

that

First,  rapid  estimation  of  the  size  of  large  tsunami-generating
events  is  an  important  component.  An  interesting  point  about  this
is  that  this  must  be  integrated  with  basic  research,  for  it  is  re-
search  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  by  the  External
Grants  Program  of  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  that  provides  us
with the basic knowledge that allows us to characterize these enor-
mous  extreme  events.  It  is  something  that  the  operational  entities
need to take advantage of.

Secondly,  as  has  already  been  stated,  we  need  to  maintain  the
very  broadband  nature  of  these  Global  Seismic  Networks,  because
it  is  only  the  broadband  nature  that  allows  us  to  look  particularly
at  these  very  great  earthquakes.  We  have  some  specific  concerns,
which are detailed in my written testimony.

We have already touched on the notion of redundancy, and I will
simply state that redundancy is a factor not only of the geographic
coverage  in  both  the  seismometer  and  in  the  buoy  systems,  but  in
the  engineering,  research,  and  development  that  must  occur  for
basic  elements  of  these  instruments.  In  my  view,  the  Administra-
tion’s proposal is lacking in engineering R&D funds.

A  second  set  of  elements  to  consider  is  the  need  to  ensure  suffi-
cient  local  capacity  to  use  these  warnings.  We  are  about  to  hear
some details on that, but I would also point out that this is of sig-
nificant  importance  internationally.  We  already  know,  the  warn-
ings  can  not  be  used  unless  there  is  infrastructure  on  the  ground,
capacity  on  the  ground  to  use  them.  And  this  is  a  particular  prob-
lem if the United States is to take a leadership role internationally.
Data  archives  for  performance-based  assessments  of  these  sys-
tems  need  to  be  implemented  so  that  we  understand,  as  in  cases
in  December  26,  what  might  have  gone  wrong,  what  needs  to  be
improved,  and  what  other  research  and  technology  we  need  to  im-
plement to provide adequate warnings.

And  finally,  stable  support  for  operations  and  maintenance  as
well  as  engineering  research  and  development  needs  to  be  found.
Finally, the leveraging of the Tsunami Warning System ought to
be  done  in  two  ways.  The  Tsunami  Warning  System  ought  to  be
a  step  toward  the  System  of  Systems,  as  we  know,  GEOSS.  What
we need to do is to ensure interoperability among the international
partners  and  among  the  different  observing  systems,  and  in  fact,
the  Tsunami  Warning  System,  as  proposed,  can  be  a  confidence-
building measure in that way.

We  also  need  to  ensure  that  the  dual  goals  of  both  the  research
and the operational communities are satisfied, and again, the Tsu-
nami  Warning  System  provides  that  confidence-building  measure
as a pilot program.

My final remark, that the U.S. ought to show leadership in link-
ing  global  Earth  observations  to  smart  recovery  in  the  Indian
Ocean  and  to  sound  development  elsewhere  in  the  world,  because,
after  all,  hazards  are  problems  of  the  poor,  not  just  of  the  devel-
oped world.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ARTHUR L. LERNER-LAM

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  thank  you  for  the  invitation  to
provide  testimony  on  the  recent  tsunami  tragedy  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  and  strate-
gies  for  reducing  the  risk  from  tsunamis  and  other  natural  disasters  in  the  United
States and worldwide.

I  am  a  seismologist  holding  the  position  of  Doherty  Senior  Research  Scientist  at
the  Lamont-Doherty  Earth  Observatory  of  Columbia  University,  in  Palisades,  New
York.  I  am  also  the  Associate  Director  for  Seismology,  Geology,  and  Tectonophysics
at the Observatory. I am the Director of the Center for Hazards and Risk Research
in the Earth Institute at Columbia. As Director, I have overseen research in natural
hazard  risk  assessment  and  management,  including  the  preparation  of  major  re-
ports  for  the  World  Bank  on  the  exposures  of  populations  and  country  economies
to multiple natural hazards.

The  magnitude  9.0  Sumatra-Andaman  Islands  Earthquake  of  26  December,  2004
and the resultant basin-wide tsunami in the Indian Ocean killed more than 212,000
people  and  has  exposed  millions  more  to  additional  risks  from  injury,  disease,  loss
of livelihood, increased vulnerability to recurrent natural hazards and other disrup-
tions to their cultural and civil institutions. In coastal areas known to have suffered
significant casualties from the tsunami and where relief efforts are now focused, the
estimates of the exposed population living within one kilometer of the coast or with-
in  two  kilometers  of  the  coast  are  2.1  and  4.2  million  people,  respectively  (compila-
tion  by  Balk,  Gorokhovich  and  Levy,  2005,  Center  for  Earth  Science  Information
Network  (CIESIN)  at  Columbia  University,  unpublished  report  to  various  relief
agencies).  Economic  damages,  and  economic  losses  resulting  from  damage  to  eco-
systems, are also severe. For example, in published reports released just last week,
a  preliminary  estimate  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  places  the  economic  losses
to  Indonesia  alone  at  $4.45  billion.  These  estimates  suggest  that  initial  economic
damage  reports,  which  were  based  on  quick  evaluations  of  the  geographic  exposure
of  major  economic  activity  and  insured  property,  did  not  fully  reflect  the  spectrum
of long-lasting economic impacts. Preliminary needs assessments by the United Na-
tions,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  international  development  organizations  will  be
completed  soon,  but  early  results  suggest  that  the  region’s  recovery  from  the  dis-
aster will be long and complicated. Experience with this tsunami and other natural
disasters in the Indian Ocean suggests that vulnerability to natural disasters is and
will  continue  to  be  a  major  problem  for  people  and  countries  in  the  region.  The  po-
tential exposure of Indian Ocean coastal populations to oceanographic and meteoro-
logical hazards, such as tsunamis and typhoons, is great. Our compilations indicate
that  10.6  million  people  live  within  one  kilometer  of  the  coastlines  around  the  Bay
of  Bengal  and  eastern  Indian  Ocean,  and  19.2  million  people  live  within  two  kilo-
meters.

It  is  understandable,  then,  with  such  grave  damage  and  casualties,  that  the
United  States  and  the  rest  of  the  developed  world  have  responded  to  the  humani-
tarian  emergency  with  compassion  and  largess.  These  efforts  are  now  known  to
have  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  emergency  needs  of  the  people  and  govern-
ments in the region. It is also understandable that the first response of the scientific
and  technical  communities,  including  those  agencies  that  have  operational  respon-
sibilities for tsunami warnings, has been to emphasize the expansion of existing tsu-
nami  warning  systems  to  provide  global  coverage.  This  technical  response  is  justi-
fied  by  the  benefits  of  adequate  warning  when  compared  to  the  expected  life  and
economic  loss  from  extreme  geophysical,  oceanographic  and  meteorological  events.
Indeed,  the  costs  of  the  system  proposed  by  the  Administration  are  modest  when
compared  with  the  potential  losses.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  mor-
tality and economic losses from other natural hazards are also large, occur more fre-
quently, and could also benefit from improved and sustained programs of global and
regional environmental observations and monitoring, and the concomitant programs
of basic research that must accompany the acquisition of new data.
The Major Causes of Tsunamis and Tsunami Prediction

Statistical  analysis  of  past  tsunami  occurrences,  which  are  recorded  either  in  the
historic  or  geologic  records,  is  one  of  the  most  reliable  ways  of  assessing  tsunami
hazard  risk.  However,  tsunamis  are  caused  by  a  range  of  complex  natural  phe-
nomena, making the prediction of any future tsunami difficult. Improvements in the
forecasting  and  characterization  of  the  main  tsunamigenic  events  will  improve  tsu-
nami risk assessments.

Tsunamis  are  caused  by  the  sudden  displacement  of  extremely  large  volumes  of

in  the  geologic  record  for  each  of  these  sources.  However,  the  largest  destructive
tsunamis  in  recorded  history  are  caused  most  frequently  by  earthquake,  landslide
and volcanic events. We call these ‘‘source events.’’

The first source of uncertainty in predicting future tsunami occurrence is the un-
certainty  associated  with  predicting  the  occurrences  of  source  events.  Large  events
that  produce  extreme  tsunamis  are  themselves  rare,  and  the  modern  instrumental
record  is  not  yet  long  enough  to  provide  high  quality  quantitative  observations  of
extreme  events.  For  example,  one  difficulty  in  predicting  earthquake-generated
tsunamis is our limited understanding of the dynamics of great earthquakes. When
we  can  forecast  great  events,  we  may  be  able  to  forecast  tsunamis,  but  this  is  not
now achievable unambiguously. Nevertheless, the Sumatra-Andaman Islands Earth-
quake is the first magnitude 9 event to be captured by modern high-fidelity seismic
networks,  especially  the  Global  Seismographic  Network  (GSN)  operated  by  the  In-
corporated  Research  Institutions  for  Seismology  (IRIS),  an  academic  consortium
supported by the National Science Foundation in collaboration with the U.S Geologi-
cal  Survey.  Research  on  this  earthquake,  much  of  it  to  be  funded  by  the  NSF  and
the  external  grants  program  of  the  USGS,  will  without  doubt  enlarge  the  body  of
knowledge  about  great  earthquakes,  including  why  they  are  different  from  merely
large earthquakes. This research will help immeasurably in understanding the proc-
esses  within  large  subduction  zones  that  produce  great  shallow  megathrusts.  It  is
difficult to predict whether this will lead to the ability to predict the precise timing
of  a  tsunamigenic  earthquake,  but  identification  of  probable  locations  and  esti-
mation of decade-scale probabilistic risk are achievable goals.

community  of 

Submarine and coastal landslides are beginning to be understood in theory. There
is  a  vigorous 
theoretical  and  observational
geomorphologists  who  have  compiled  an  impressive  track  record  of  research.  How-
ever,  landslides  are  complex  phenomena  whose  impacts  on  humans  may  be  quan-
tified by examining the geological and historical record for past occurrence. This can
produce  risk  factors  in  a  probabilistic  sense,  but,  again,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the
precise timing, location, and size of a future event. This probabilistic assessment has
been  done  in  a  preliminary  fashion,  globally,  for  landslides  on  land  (Norwegian
Geotechnical  Institute,  referenced  in  Dilley,  Chen,  Deichmann  and  Lerner-Lam,
2005,  Global  Natural  Disaster  Risk  Hotspots,  Report  to  The  World  Bank,  Hazard
Management  Unit,  in  press),  but  a  systematic  assessment  of  undersea  slide  prob-
abilities has not yet been achieved.

Among the major tsunami source events, it is often suggested that volcanic erup-
tions  are  relatively  amenable,  both  in  theory  and  practice,  to  monitoring  and  pre-
diction. Most vulcanologists believe that individual volcanoes can be well character-
ized  and  incipient  eruptions  can  be  accurately  detected,  provided  that  the  volcano
is  heavily  instrumented  and  constantly  monitored.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  fol-
lows  this  approach  through  its  various  Volcano  Observatories,  and  there  are  a  few
other  examples  around  the  globe  where  progress  has  been  made.  However,  it  takes
years  of  continuous  observation  to  ‘‘fingerprint’’  an  individual  volcano  to  the  extent
that eruptions can be foreseen, and it is not pragmatic to do this globally. Of course,
not  every  volcano,  not  even  the  most  dangerous  ones,  is  instrumented  adequately.
It  should  be  a  high  priority  to  identify  the  most  dangerous  volcanoes  in  terms  of
their tsunamigenic potential, and observe them accordingly. However, predicting an
eruption,  and  predicting  the  nature  of  volcanic  mass  flank  movement  that  could
cause a tsunami are two different things. The latter is related more to landslide dy-
namics and should be connected to that area of inquiry and monitoring.

international 

In  contrast  to  source  dynamics,  the  theory  of  tsunami  propagation  in  the  open
ocean  is  reasonably  well  understood,  but  uncertainties  arise  from  unmapped  small-
scale  variations  in  ocean  and  coastal  bathymetry,  complexities  in  the  excitation  of
the  tsunami  at  its  source,  and  in  its  amplitude  or  ‘‘run-up’’  at  the  shoreline.  The
‘‘source  function’’  of  the  tsunami  can  be  understood  in  general  terms  as  the  area  of
the  seafloor  that  is  vertically  displaced  by  a  submarine  earthquake,  or  by  the  size
and  velocity  of  a  submarine,  volcanic  or  coastal  landslide,  or  by  the  explosive  force
of a volcanic event. Any uncertainty in measuring the size of these source functions
leads to uncertainty in predicting the amplitude of a tsunami.

Amplitude  uncertainty  is  further  enlarged  by  uncertainties  in  ocean  and  coastal
bathymetry and coastline topography. Variations in coastal bathymetry can focus or
defocus  tsunami  energy,  and  small-scale  features  in  the  on-shore  topography  can
lead  both  to  excessive  run  ups  and  safe  harbor  from  the  onslaught  of  the  tsunami
surge.

In  contrast  to  the  tsunami  source  events  and  run-up  amplitudes,  the  progress  of
a  tsunami  wave  across  an  ocean  basin  is  rather  more  predictable.  Once  a  tsunami
wave  is  generated,  it  travels  through  the  ocean  at  a  speed  that  is  proportional  to
the  square  root  of  the  ocean  depth.  While  our  detailed  knowledge  of  ocean  bathym-

etry  is  limited,  enough  is  known  about  the  larger  scale  variations  in  ocean  depth
to  accurately  predict  the  arrival  time  of  a  tsunami  once  it  is  generated.  This  time
is  sufficiently  long  for  ocean  crossing  tsunamis  that  warning  systems  based  on  the
detection  of  the  open-water  tsunami  wave  make  sense.  Even  in  the  case  of  source
events proximal to a vulnerable coast, tsunami propagation in shallow water is slow
enough so that at least some simple and quickly delivered warnings could save lives.
Predicting  tsunami  damage  is  more  difficult,  because  the  physical  properties  of
potential  tsunamis  must  be  convolved  with  population  densities,  the  fragilities  of
the built environment, and other difficult measures of physical, economic and social
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, it is interesting that initial tsunami models of the In-
dian  Ocean  event  did  a  reasonably  good  job  of  explaining  the  observed  damage.  In
large  measure,  the  relatively  low  impact  on  Bangladesh,  for  example,  was  due  to
predictable  physics  of  the  tsunami  propagation.  Similarly,  the  large  impacts  in
Southeast India and Sri Lanka are, in a gross sense, predicted by these rudimentary
models.  On  the  other  hand,  the  destruction  in  Aceh  Province  in  Indonesia,  though
expected  (and  nearly  complete)  because  of  proximity  to  the  source  region  of  the
earthquake, would be difficult to predict in detail.

This combination of uncertainties reinforces the need for warning systems to have
an  oceanographic  component  combined  with  rapid  source  event  identification  and
characterization. It also emphasizes the need to build local and regional capacity to
make effective use of a warning when it is received.
History of Major Tsunamis

Tsunami  size  may  be  measured  by  physical  parameters  such  as  maximum  run-
up height and total number of shoreline incursions. Figures 1 and 2 show these pa-
rameters  for  the  largest  tsunamis  in  well-researched  historical  databases  of  disas-
ters.  Observed  run-ups  and  incursions  are  not  yet  tabulated  for  the  Indian  Ocean
tsunami.  It  is  apparent  in  these  figures  that  the  tsunami  run-ups  and  incursions
in the Aleutian Islands and continental Alaska are among the largest recorded. (The
Mt.  St.  Helens  run-up  is  included  to  illustrate  the  near-source  effect  of  a  cata-
strophic  volcanic  landslide  although,  in  this  case,  the  effect  was  localized.)  Prelimi-
nary reports from survey teams suggest that the run-up heights in the Indian Ocean
probably  did  not  achieve  these  levels,  but  that  the  total  number  of  on-shore  incur-
sions will probably approach the observed maximum. Figure 3 shows historical tsu-
nami  mortality,  including  recent  data  from  the  Indian  Ocean,  which  places  this
event as the most deadly tsunami ever recorded.

Taken together, these charts illustrate that the total destruction caused by a tsu-
nami is not just a function of run-up height, which is controlled by local bathymetry
and topography, but more a function of the tsunami’s geographic scope and the over-
lap with the geography of human habitation. From the point of view of tsunami risk
assessment, this makes the obvious point that we should be concerned with the ex-
posure of densely populated and economically productive low-lying areas near coast-
lines.

The causes of these largest tsunamis are either large underwater thrusting earth-
quakes  or  cataclysmic  volcanic  eruptions,  and  the  observed  mortality  and  physical
impacts  are  known  to  occur  along  coastlines  far  from  the  event  as  well  as  those  in
close proximity. Thus the potential exposure of low-lying coastal areas must encom-
pass an assessment of possible source events throughout the ocean basins.

Great thrusting earthquakes in the Atlantic Ocean are rare compared with occur-
rences in the Pacific, because there are only a few places in the Atlantic where the
tectonic  plates  that  make  up  the  crust  of  the  Earth  are  colliding.  The  most  famous
of  these  is  the  Lisbon  earthquake  of  1755,  which  generated  a  destructive  tsunami
along the coasts of western Europe and northwestern Africa. This tsunami was also
observed in the eastern Caribbean.

Thrusting  earthquakes  are  observed  along  the  eastern  boundaries  of  the  Carib-
bean  plate  and  in  the  Scotia  Arc  at  the  southern  tip  of  South  America.  Some  of
these  earthquakes  have  generated  tsunamis  in  the  past,  although  the  effects  have
been  regional  or  local.  Lander  et  al.  (2002)  have  published  a  list  of  observed  ‘‘wave
events’’  in  the  Caribbean  and  judge  27  of  these  to  be  ‘‘true’’  tsunamis  and  another
nine  to  be  ‘‘very  likely  true’’  tsunamis.  The  last  destructive  tsunami  in  the  Carib-
bean occurred in August, 1946, the consequence of a magnitude 8.1 earthquake, and
killed  a  reported  1600  people.  Tsunami  waves  from  this  event  were  observed  along
the  eastern  coast  of  the  United  States.  Recently  published  work  by  ten  Brink  and
Lin  (USGS  and  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution,  Journal  of  Geophysical  Re-
search,  December  2004)  confirm  the  current  potential  for  large  tsunamigenic  earth-
quakes near Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Hispaniola.

A  more  problematic  scenario  in  the  Atlantic  is  the  generation  of  tsunamis  by  ex-
treme  events  such  as  intraplate  earthquakes,  submarine  landslides  on  the  conti-

nental  shelf,  and  the  collapse  of  volcanic  edifices.  Two  examples  are  the  1886
Charleston  Earthquake  and  the  1929  Grand  Banks  Earthquake,  both  of  which  pro-
duced regionally observed and damaging tsunamis. These events do not fall readily
within  the  plate  tectonic  framework  that  governs  much  of  our  understanding  of
great earthquakes. In intraplate settings, the smaller earthquakes that would allow
seismologists  to  effectively  characterize  potential  earthquake  source  zones  are  rel-
atively infrequent, and it can take decades to accumulate enough high quality data
to develop a recurrence or probability model. The situation is even more problematic
for  submarine  landslides  and  edifice  collapse.  Some  of  these  potential  tsunami
source  events  could  be  triggered  by  just  moderate  earthquakes,  by  gravitational  in-
stability, by the release of trapped gas, or by large meteorological storms. Thus the
lack of major colliding plate boundaries, as in the ‘‘Ring of Fire’’ around the Pacific,
does  not  suggest  that  the  Atlantic  Ocean  Basin  is  geologically  ‘‘quiet.’’  On  the  con-
trary,  geologic  mapping  of  the  continental  shelf,  when  done  with  sufficient  resolu-
tion,  shows  an  active  landscape  modified  by  sudden  mass  movements.  Much  more
work needs to be done to quantify these potential tsunami source events.

The potential instability of the volcanic edifice on Cumbre Vieja in the Canary Is-
lands should be taken seriously. This is one of the most active volcanoes in the At-
lantic, and Ward and Day (UC Santa Cruz, Geophysical Research Letters, 2001) con-
structed  a  collapse  scenario  that  could  in  principle  create  a  meters-high  inundation
of  the  eastern  seaboard  of  the  United  States.  While  there  are  many  unknown  fac-
tors, including the potential size of the edifice collapse, the possibility of a damaging
or  devastating  tsunami  cannot  be  dismissed.  While  more  geophysical  work  is  cer-
tainly  warranted,  precautionary  monitoring  of  the  volcano  could  detect  imminent
collapse,  and  oceanographic  monitoring  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  could  detect  the  ap-
proach of a destructive tsunami in time to issue a warning.

In the absence of deterministic predictions, tsunami scenario modeling serves the
purpose  of  parameterizing  the  potential  range  of  tsunami  source  events  and  im-
pacts.
Weighing the Risks of Tsunamis and Other Natural Disasters

A  systems  approach  to  comparative  risk  analysis  for  multiple  natural  hazards  is
emerging  in  importance,  as  we  continue  to  understand  that  what  causes  a  natural
hazard to turn into a disaster is the exposure and vulnerability of people and their
institutions  as  well  as  geophysical  parameters.  Some  of  the  same  fragilities  that
make  people  vulnerable  to  hurricanes,  typhoons  and  extreme  weather  also  make
them  vulnerable  to  tsunamis  and  even  earthquakes.  Thus  it  is  important  to  under-
stand how reducing vulnerability to one set of hazards can improve resiliency to an-
other  set.  Leveraging  investments  in  one  area  of  hazard  mitigation  to  improve  an-
other is one way in which comparative risk analysis can improve the use of limited
resources.

Global multiple hazard analyses have been completed recently by the United Na-
tions  Development  Program  and  by  the  Columbia  Earth  Institute  in  collaboration
with  the  World  Bank  and  other  international  partners  (for  example,  Dilley  et  al.,
2005).  Figure  4  shows  a  compilation  of  globally-normalized  multiple  hazard  mor-
tality from Dilley et al. (2005). Figure 5 shows the same analysis in detail for North
America, the Caribbean, and Central America. By far the most significant mortality
risks  globally  are  hydrometeorological  hazards  in  South,  East,  and  Southeast  Asia/
Southwest  Pacific  as  well  as  Central  and  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  and
drought  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  (Significant  earthquake  and  landslide  risks  domi-
nate parts of the Middle East and Central Asia.) Hydrometeorological mortality risk
is  significant  because  the  same  factors  that  aggravate  this  risk  also  aggravate  the
risk from tsunamis. The United States, despite its exposure to multiple hazards, has
a relatively low mortality on a global scale. Figures 6 and 7 show the same multiple
hazard  compilation  for  aggregate  economic  risk.  The  United  States  risk  is  elevated
in  absolute  terms  because  of  the  geographic  distribution  of  people  and  assets  on
both  coasts.  Figures  8  and  9  show  the  same  compilation  normalized  by  country
GDP.  Again,  the  U.S.  risk  is  downgraded  in  relative  terms  to  the  rest  of  the  globe.
However  it  is  important  to  note  that  even  in  relative  terms,  the  proportional  eco-
nomic risk to the US from geophysical and hydrometeorological hazards on the West
and  East  Coasts  respectively  is  in  the  top  three  deciles  globally.  The  mortality  risk
pattern in Figures 4 and 5 and the relative economic risk pattern in Figures 8 and
9  show  similarities,  indicating  that  on  a  global  level,  multiple  disaster  risk  is  an
important issue for developing countries and one of the persistent issues facing the
world’s poor.

In  comparative  terms,  the  geophysical  risk  along  the  West  Coast  of  the  United
States  and  the  hydrometeorological  risk  along  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States
are  two  expressions  of  tsunami  risk  as  well.  While  tsunamis  were  not  included  in

this calculation (for technical reasons), the proximity of the West Coast and Alaska
to  the  Cascadia  and  Aleutian  Subduction  Zones,  and  its  exposure  to  trans-oceanic
Pacific  tsunamis,  generates  a  tsunami  risk  that  is  highly  correlated  to  the  earth-
quake  and  hydrometeorological  risks.  Similarly,  the  relatively  high  exposure  of  the
Eastern  Seaboard  to  hydrometeorological  disasters  suggests  that  its  exposure  to
trans-Atlantic or Caribbean-generated tsunamis would be high also.

In  the  Caribbean  (c.f.  Figures  5,  7,  9),  relative  mortality,  and  aggregate  and  pro-
portionate  economic  exposure  all  suggest  that  multiple-hazard  vulnerability  reduc-
tion should be a necessary component of development. In general, mortality and eco-
nomic  exposure  to  earthquakes,  landslides,  extreme  weather  and  hurricanes,  and
floods in the Caribbean is greater than for tsunamis, on the basis of historical data.
However,  mitigation  strategies  for  earthquake  and  hurricane  hazards  in  particular,
will  have  the  dual  outcome  of  reducing  vulnerabilities  to  tsunamis  as  well.  When
coupled with comprehensive earthquake and ocean observation and real time warn-
ing,  these  strategies  should  significantly  reduce  the  natural  hazard  risk  faced  by
people in the Caribbean.

It  is  in  this  system  context  that  the  United  States  should  weigh  the  risk  of
tsunamis against the risk of other natural disasters. The risk from tsunamis is real,
but  from  a  historical  perspective,  the  risk  from  other  natural  hazards  is  also  real
and,  in  most  cases,  greater.  A  tsunami  risk  reduction  program  should  be  part  of  a
comprehensive  multi-hazard  risk  reduction  strategy,  in  terms  of  the  use  of  modern
observational  and  monitoring  networks,  in  the  establishment  of  building  codes  and
risk reduction policies, and in the issuance and use of warnings. The costs of mitiga-
tion strategies and warning systems, part of a comprehensive suite of risk reduction
strategies,  should  also  be  weighed  against  the  repetitive  costs  of  disaster  recovery
and  reconstruction  in  the  United  States  and  around  the  globe.  Where  it  has  been
systematically  computed  (for  example,  by  Smyth  et  al.,  Earthquake  Spectra,  2004,
for  residential  buildings  in  certain  earthquakes  and  other  work)  the  benefit-to-cost
ratio of hazard mitigation and warning strategies favors pre-emptive action.

In  particular,  linkages  between  tsunami  and  storm/hurricane  warning  systems

and emergency management operations should be explored.
The Administration’s Proposal for a Tsunami Warning System

Figure  10  is  a  timeline,  with  information  from  NOAA’s  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning
Center  (PTWC)  on  the  initial  earthquake  location  process,  overlain  on  the  records
from the Global Seismographic Network (GSN). The timeline indicates that agencies
with  operational  responsibilities  were  able  to  locate  the  Sumatra-Andaman  Islands
earthquake  and  assign  a  preliminary  magnitude  (MwP  =  8.0)  within  11  minutes  of
the origin of the earthquake, using seven stations of the GSN. A public tsunami in-
formation bulletin was broadcast by 15 minutes after the origin. Forty-five minutes
after  the  origin,  seismic  waves  from  27  stations  of  the  GSN  were  analyzed  and  the
magnitude was increased to MwP = 8.5. A second tsunami warning bulletin was re-
leased  65  minutes  after  the  origin  with  the  upgraded  magnitude  and  included  a
statement of tsunami risk near the epicenter. Approximately six hours after the ori-
gin,  seismologists  at  Harvard,  using  a  different  measurement  technique  and  more
stations,  obtained  a  magnitude  Mw  =  8.9,  which  was  refined  upward  to  Mw  =  9.0
at  about  twenty  hours  after  the  earthquake.  These  larger  magnitudes  were  incor-
porated into later NEIC bulletins.

The  continuing  analysis  and  increasing  magnitude  estimates  illustrate  the  dif-
ficulty  of  characterizing  a  great  earthquake  source  under  operational  conditions.
(There are related difficulties in characterizing large landslide and volcanic sources
as well.) Locating an earthquake is a relatively simple task, but measuring its size,
particularly  when  the  area  of  rupture  is  large  and  the  rupture  process  is  extended
in time, is more difficult. Luckily the Harvard method, and other methods developed
by  research  seismologists,  can  be  operationalized.  This  has  implications  for  the  de-
sign of a tsunami warning system.

The  first  requirement  (and  the  first  component  of  the  Administration’s  proposals
for  an  enhanced  tsunami  warning  system)  is  the  rapid  detection  and  characteriza-
tion of large undersea earthquakes. This is best done by using a global seismic net-
work  such  as  the  GSN  (Figure  11)  coupled  with  enhanced  capabilities  at  the  NEIC
and  the  existing  tsunami  warning  centers.  Three  elements  of  the  GSN  are  impor-
tant:  (1)  its  global  coverage  and  international  relationships,  as  epitomized  by  the
IRIS  and  USGS  relationships  with  other  nations  and  international  seismological
groups;  (2)  100  percent  station  telemetry  allowing  real-time  retrieval  of  seismic  ob-
servations  with  sufficient  redundancy;  and  (3)  its  use  of  very  broad-band
seismometers  that  provide  superior  recordings  of  seismic  signals  from  great  earth-
quakes.  Enhancements  to  the  NEIC  should  be  made  to  provide  true  24/7  capabili-
ties.  The  NEIC  should  also  operationalize  advanced  source  characterization  tools

63

now used by the academic research community. This will ensure more realistic esti-
mates for the largest earthquakes.

The  Administration’s  proposals  for  enhancements  to  the  NEIC  and  the  GSN,  in-
cluding  the  installation  of  new  stations  in  the  Caribbean  would  accomplish  most  of
what is required.

Four  components  are  missing  from  this  part  of  the  Administration’s  proposal.
First,  the  very  broad-band  seismometers  required  to  correctly  characterize  very
large  earthquakes  are  nearing  the  end  of  their  operational  lifetime,  and  the  manu-
facturer  may  not  be  in  a  position  to  produce  replacements.  The  seismological  com-
munity  is  concerned  that  research  and  development  of  the  next  generation  of  very
broad-band  sensors  is  not  taking  place  in  a  timely  manner.  Second,  in  addition  to
Caribbean  stations,  the  GSN  should  be  enhanced  by  selected  deployments  of  sub-
marine  seismometers.  The  characterization  of  very  large  subduction  zone  earth-
quakes  could  be  enhanced  by  well-sited  ocean  bottom  broad-band  stations.  Third,
the Administration’s proposal makes no mention of the level of and need for contin-
ued  support  for  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  enhanced  GSN  and  NEIC.
Fourth, support for peer-reviewed research on large event characterization, best per-
formed  by  the  university  community  through  the  National  Science  Foundation  and
the external grants program of the USGS, does not appear to be part of the Admin-
istration’s plan.

A  second  component  of  the  enhanced  tsunami  warning  system  is  the  deployment
of ocean water level sensors and tide gauges that are telemetered to operational cen-
ters.  The  Administration  proposes  the  deployment  of  additional  Deep-ocean  Assess-
ment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART)  buoys.  The  proposed  deployment  sites  in
the Administration’s plan are good choices. However, it would be prudent to acquire
additional  DART  buoys  and  deploy  them  to  provide  operational  redundancy.  Addi-
tionally,  there  are  some  questions  about  the  reliability  of  current  DART  buoy  de-
sign. Three of the six buoys currently deployed are not operational. The Administra-
tion proposal does not include any funds for research and development work for an
improved DART buoy system. The initial deployments should be followed by an en-
gineering research and development effort to improve buoy performance. Long-term
stable  sources  of  funding  for  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  DART  buoys  and
concomitant technology should also be a part of the Administration’s proposal. I am
not aware of the details of how new tide gauges will be deployed and how they will
be  telemetered  to  a  central  monitoring  facility  and  cannot  comment  on  that  aspect
at this time.

A  third  component  of  a  tsunami  warning  system  is  the  engagement  of  regional,
State  and  local  agencies  to  design  the  most  effective  way  of  distributing  a  tsunami
warning  and  preemptive  investments  in  strategies  to  reduce  tsunami  vulnerability.
Most  emergency  management  agencies  place  the  highest  priority  on  this  aspect  of
warning systems. Existing tsunami and storm warning programs overseen by NOAA
should  be  highlighted,  strengthened  where  necessary,  and  continuing  revenue
streams identified. The incorporation of new research results, inundation maps, risk
assessments and other products should be rigorous and timely. The Administration’s
proposal  does  not  address  these  specific  issues,  although  they  may  be  addressed
elsewhere. These elements will be particularly important in the extension of the tsu-
nami warning system to less-developed countries.

The  Administration’s  proposal  should  be  leveraged  in  two  major  ways.  First,  a
tsunami warning system should be part of a more comprehensive real-time environ-
mental  monitoring  and  observation  system  with  global  coverage.  Planning  docu-
ments  for  the  GEOSS  (Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems)  allude  to  this
hazard  reduction  functionality.  The  proposed  tsunami  warning  system  can  be  used
as  an  exercise  within  the  GEOSS  framework  to  identify  and  illustrate  likely  effi-
ciencies,  difficulties,  and  integration  issues  for  the  larger  system.  Additionally,  the
Earth observation community should be motivated to develop specific plans to incor-
porate  other  sensor  technology  into  the  DART  systems  as  a  pilot  opportunity.  Sec-
ond, in addition to expanding the monitoring capacity, the development of a tsunami
warning  system  should  be  leveraged  to  spur  the  development  of  multiple  hazard
warning  or  monitoring  systems  for  hazards  that  pose  a  quantitatively  greater  risk
and  more  persistent  risk  than  tsunamis.  A  good  place  to  start  would  be  to  develop
a  spectrum  of  coastal  hazard  monitoring  technologies  to  deal  with  the  geophysical
and meteorological hazards faced by Hawaii, Alaska, and the East and West Coasts.
Moreover,  the  expansion  of  NEIC  capabilities  should  include  funding  of  the  Ad-
vanced  National  Seismic  System  to  the  appropriated  level,  to  enhance  not  just  tsu-
nami monitoring but achieve the required level of earthquake monitoring and earth-
quake hazard reduction for the Nation.

The  Administration’s  proposal  does  not  have  a  specific  component  of  assessment,
nor is there a specific component on data archiving and post-warning analysis. The

tsunami  warning  system  should  be  open  to  periodic  review  by  both  the  operational
and  research  communities,  to  promote  the  integration  of  new  research  results  into
operational  capabilities.  This  assessment  should  include  the  NEIC  where  appro-
priate.  Data  archiving  is  necessary,  not  just  for  research  purposes,  but  to  provide
the quantitative basis for assessments.

Finally,  it  bears  mention  that  the  foundation  of  hazard  mitigation  is  basic  re-
search in geophysical, oceanographic, atmospheric and environmental sciences. It is
puzzling  that  the  Administration’s  proposal  does  not  amplify  the  fundamental  role
that the National Science Foundation plays in providing this research for the Nation
and the world. In fact, without the investments that the NSF has made in the GSN,
in earthquake science, and in oceanographic science and observations, the Adminis-
tration would not now be in a position to so quickly design and deploy an enhanced
tsunami warning system. Tsunami source characterization, propagation and run-up
scenarios  are  just  a  few  of  the  areas  where  additional  research  could  provide  bene-
fits.
The  Role  of  the  U.S.  in  an  Indian  Ocean  and  Worldwide  Tsunami  Warning

Network

The World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan, has just ended with
the release of the Hyogo Framework for Action: 2005–2015. This non-binding frame-
work  calls  for  the  reduction  of  natural  hazard  vulnerabilities,  and  asks  countries
with  significant  hazard  exposure  to  place  vulnerability  reduction  on  their  agendas.
The  Framework  also  calls  for  global  and  regional  collaboration  where  appropriate.
Environmental  monitoring  and  hazard  warning  systems  are  areas  where  regional
cooperation is important and appropriate.

From the work of the Earth Institute and other sources, we know that the Central
and  South  Asia,  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  the  Caribbean,  Central  America  and
Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, all face significant exposures from multiple haz-
ards in terms of mortality and economic impact. The United States is in an excellent
position to take an international leadership role in supporting a cooperative and col-
laborative agenda of environmental monitoring, hazard reduction, and international
capacity building in environmental science and technology.
The U.S. can take a leadership role in the following ways:

1. Encourage country-level needs assessments, in collaboration with ongoing ef-
forts  by  the  United  Nations  and  World  Bank  through  their  post-disaster  ac-
tivities,  of  multiple  hazard  vulnerabilities,  and  use  these  needs  assessments
to  provide  a  prioritization  framework  for  international  projects  in  natural
hazard  observation,  monitoring  and  warning  systems,  and  natural  hazard
mitigation;

2. Use  an  international  framework  such  as  GEOSS  to  incorporate  tsunami
warning  as  a  confidence  building  measure  among  the  parties.  Some  of  this
may  be  done  with  bilateral  agreements,  or  in  partnership  with  other  devel-
oped  countries  such  as  Japan,  Australia  and  others.  The  rapid  deployment
of  the  U.S.  and  Indian  Ocean  systems  now  being  proposed  by  the  U.S.  and
other countries should comprise a pilot project for the implementation of the
GEOSS framework. The technology and operational components of a tsunami
warning  system  are  very  well-defined  and,  with  some  effort  devoted  to  tech-
nical  and  data  integration,  a  global  warning  system  could  provide  the  con-
crete  accomplishment  needed  to  energize  further  international  development
of GEOSS;

3. Leverage tsunami warning technology, particularly the observational compo-
nents  comprising  the  GSN  and  DART  buoys,  to  encourage  development  of
country-level  technical  capacity  to  collect,  archive  and  share  environmental,
meteorological and geophysical data according to international standards;

4. Develop  an  international  framework  for  funding  streams  for  continued  oper-
ations and maintenance of observing systems. Some of this may be done with
regional partnerships;

5. Develop  standards  for  data  exchange  and  data  integration  in  an  inter-
national framework. A good example is the IRIS consortium, which has suc-
cessfully  combined  both  operational  and  research  components  in  an  inter-
national structure;

6. Work  with  the  international  scientific  and  technical  communities,  including
academic communities, to promote basic and applied research in natural haz-
ard phenomena and risk reduction and management.

In  brief,  the  U.S.  leadership  role  should  not  be  confined  to  technical  leadership.
We have the ability to link our scientific and technical excellence to the longer-term

disaster  reduction  and  development  goals  of  less-developed  countries.  This  can  be
done by specifically demonstrating how implementation of a global tsunami warning
system in the short term can improve longer-term prospects for risk-conscious devel-
opment.

opportunity to provide testimony on this important initiative.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And Dr.—Mr. Wilson.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JAY  WILSON,  COORDINATOR,  EARTH-
QUAKE  AND  TSUNAMI  PROGRAMS,  PLANS  AND  TRAINING
SECTION, OREGON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
Mr.  WILSON.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  this
committee. I am honored by the opportunity to represent the State
of Oregon’s tsunami programs. I would also like to acknowledge our
State partners, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and California, which
participate in the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.

[Slide.]
As  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Program  Coordinator  for  Or-

egon Emergency Management—oh, I should say next slide.

[Slide.]
I  represent  this  office  and  the  State  of  Oregon  on  several  state-
wide,  regional,  and  national  earthquake  and  tsunami  councils  and
commissions. Much of my time is spent conducting education, tech-
nical assistance, and program support to local officials and collabo-
rating  with  State  and  federal  counterparts  on  related  projects  and
policies.

One of the greatest challenges for the State of Oregon is creating
and sustaining a culture of awareness in the populations of coastal
residents and coastal visitors so they know instinctively that strong
ground shaking at the coast is their signal to evacuate immediately
to higher ground. In fact, the most lives saved in the Indian Ocean
were  due  to  the  educated  response  of  a  few  people  who  recognized
the signs of an oncoming tsunami.

In  the  case  of  the  U.S.  coastlines,  the  most  cost-effective  means
of  solving  this  problem  is  for  long-term  support  of  the  State  tsu-
nami  hazard  mapping  and  mitigation  programs.  We  recommend
that  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  be  perma-
nently  funded  at  the  level  of  at  least  $7.8  million  per  year  in
NOAA’s base budget and that $390,000 per year of this support be
allocated  permanently  to  each  of  the  five  participating  member
states, a total of about $2 million per year. This is to support long-
term  tsunami  hazard  mapping,  intensive  education  programs,  and
the strengthening of local emergency notification infrastructure.

Next slide.
[Slide.]
NOAA’s National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program has been
instrumental  in  increasing  the  capacity  of  the  five  member  states
to conduct tsunami run-up modeling and mapping and to tailor tsu-
nami  education  and  outreach  to  local  communities.  Without  this
federally-funded  program  and  its  portion  for  each  state,  there
would be little, if any, tsunami programs in our states.

The National Weather Service’s TsunamiReady program is an ex-
cellent  incentive  for  communities  to  reach  at  least  a  minimum
standard  of  readiness.  Reasons  for  so  few  participating  commu-
nities  in  TsunamiReady  could  be  that  this  is  a  relatively  new  pro-
gram, but more importantly, program certification requires a large
investment  of  time  and  resources  from  the  local  communities.
These  investments  include  installing  and  maintaining  emergency
notification infrastructure, posting tsunami signs, evacuation plan-

77

ning, and conducting drills and educational activities. Many coastal
communities have limited resources to carry out these program re-
quirements.

Since  meeting  the  program  criteria  is  a  local  responsibility,
TsunamiReady  participation  should  be  encouraged  by  the  perma-
nent,  increased  allocation  for  the  annual  tsunami  budgets  for  the
five states.

Next slide.
[Slide.]
In  1995,  Oregon  created  legislation  that  calls  for  mapping  tsu-
nami  inundation  zones,  and  this  includes  limitations  on  new  con-
struction,  and  requires  tsunami  drills  in  K–12  schools  within  the
inundation  zones.  Tsunami  inundation  maps  are  prepared  in  Or-
egon by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries
in  collaboration  with  NOAA  and  with  local  partners  in  academia,
principally  the  Oregon  Graduate  Institute  of  Science  and  Tech-
nology.

Based on numerical models of site-specific tsunami behavior, the
inundation  maps  are  indispensable.  Without  them,  evacuation
planning  for  complex  areas,  such  as  estuaries  and  bays,  are  mere
guesswork. Inundation maps are supported mainly by NOAA funds
through  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  with
support  by  the  State,  principally  with  labor-in-kind  contributions.
Without  the  federal  funds,  there  is  virtually  no  likelihood  that
these specialized mapping projects would have been realized.

Next slide.
[Slide.]
The  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  has  also
funded the creation and printing of local evacuation maps produced
from the inundation maps. These maps are then distributed as free
brochures  by  local  government.  Depending  on  the  resources  avail-
able  to  local  communities,  some  jurisdictions  continue  printing  the
brochures  while  others,  particularly  rural,  unincorporated  commu-
nities, often need continual financial aide.

Last slide. No, sorry. Thank you.
[Slide.]
The  Administration’s  proposed  detection  and  warning  system  is
essential  for  issuance  of  worldwide  warnings  about  large  distant
transoceanic tsunami. It is important to note that the current buoy
network  and  the  Administration’s  ocean-wide  buoy  program  would
do  little  to  limit  loss  of  life  in  coastal  areas  that  are  right  next  to
tsunami-generating  earthquake  faults.  Travel  time  from  the
Cascadia earthquake source to the U.S. West Coast is too short for
the  proposed  system  to  operate  effectively.  In  fact,  the  existing
buoys are designed and located to detect and measure outgoing tsu-
nami.

Oregon’s  communities  at  the  coastline  have  10  to  30  minutes  to
react  and  evacuate  following  a  probable  magnitude  9  Cascadia
subduction  zone  earthquake  along  our  coastline.  The  most  cost-ef-
fective  means  of  limiting  loss  of  life  from  locally-produced  tsunami
is mapping where the dangerous areas are and then implementing
a  long-term,  relentless  public  education  campaign  aimed  at  devel-
oping the culture of awareness that will cause people to leave these
dangerous  areas  when  they  feel  a  large  earthquake  at  the  coast.

Empowering local government and the coastal states to implement
this work is the most effective means of solving this problem.

In  conclusion,  I  have  just  returned  from  the  first  International
Conference  on  Urban  Disaster  Reduction  in  Kobe,  Japan  and  par-
ticipated  in  two  days  of  work  sessions  with  my  tsunami  program
counterparts  from  Japan.  Our  joint  recommendations  focused  on
the  need  to  increase  our  level  of  confidence  in  the  technology  that
we  rely  on,  to  translate  more  research  into  direct  application,  and
increase  our  investment  in  the  culture  of  awareness.  Considering
the history of Japan’s tsunami countermeasures, it is validating to
see  that  we  have  universal  concerns  about  our  respective  societies’
needed direction for higher safety.

The  proposed  increase  in  tsunami  buoys,  coupled  with  an  ex-
panded  seismic  monitoring  network,  will  greatly  enhance  our  na-
tion’s  ability  to  detect  and  warn  of  potential  distant  tsunami
strikes.  But  the  NOAA  DART  buoy  network  does  not  provide  ade-
quate warning time for near-shore tsunami. In fact, it is critical not
to  rely  on  their  warning  in  the  event  of  a  near-shore  earthquake
since so little time is available for evacuation.

Please understand that supporting each of the Pacific states’ tsu-
nami  programs  is  the  most  effective  way  to  build  the  culture  of
awareness  necessary  for  prompt  evacuation  before  local  tsunami
and  for  the  notification  infrastructure  necessary  to  deliver  warn-
ings of approaching distant tsunami.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAY WILSON

Introduction

Good morning members of the House Committee on Science. I am honored by the
opportunity to represent the State of Oregon’s tsunami programs and also acknowl-
edge our State partners, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and California, which partici-
pate  on  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  Steering  Group.  Al-
though their State tsunami programs have differences from Oregon’s, I wish to rep-
resent  their  interests  at  this  hearing  as  well.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  today’s
date  is  significant,  since  the  last  great  Cascadia  Subduction  Zone  earthquake  and
tsunami occurred on the fault 305 years ago on January 26th in 1700.
1. Please  explain  your  job  as  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Program  Coor-
dinator  in  Oregon  Emergency  Management.  What  are  the  greatest  chal-
lenges  you  face  in  helping  the  State  and  localities  prepare  for  earth-
quakes and tsunamis?
As  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Program  Coordinator  for  Oregon  Emergency
Management,  I  represent  this  office  and  the  State  of  Oregon  on  several  statewide,
regional and national earthquake and tsunami councils, commissions and consortia,
including  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  Steering  Group.  Much
of my time is spent conducting education, technical assistance and program support
to local officials regarding earthquake, tsunami and volcano risks and collaborating
with State and federal counter parts on related projects and policies.

One  of  the  greatest  challenges  for  the  State  of  Oregon  is  creating  and  sustaining
a ‘‘culture of awareness’’ in the populations of coastal residents and coastal visitors,
so  they  know  instinctively  that  strong  ground  shaking  at  the  coast  is  their  signal
to  evacuate  immediately  to  higher  ground.  Changing  public  perception  on  the  tsu-
nami  risk—low  frequency  but  high  impact  makes  public  education  a  high  priority
in  raising  awareness  level  and  changing  people’s  perceptions  of  the  tsunami  risk
and  personal  actions  they  need  to  take.  This  also  includes  the  buy-in  from  busi-
nesses in tsunami hazard zones that have to find a balance between business oppor-
tunities  and  also  buy-in  to  have  signage  in  front  of  businesses,  materials  available
for the public and the training of employees on actions to take for business survival
and protection of customers.

Another part of this challenge is to continue to provide guidance through tsunami
inundation  mapping,  evacuation  maps,  and  signs  as  to  where  the  dangerous  areas
are and how to escape to high ground. This culture of awareness is already present
in  much  of  the  Japanese  population,  because  they  have  a  lot  of  local  tsunamis  and
undersea earthquakes to reinforce this response. It is currently not the response on
the  U.S.  coast  and  obviously  not  on  the  coast  of  the  Indonesia  where  less  frequent
but much more devastating tsunamis can occur.

If  an  effective  education  program  had  been  in  place  and  if  the  local  populace  in
Indonesia  had  accurate  tsunami  hazard  maps,  thousands  of  lives  could  have  been
saved, regardless of an international warning system. The same is true for the U.S.
coasts.  In  fact  the  most  lives  saved  in  the  Indian  Ocean  were  due  to  the  educated
response of a few people who recognized the signs of an oncoming tsunami.

In the instance of the U.S. coastlines, the most cost-effective means of solving this
problem  is  for  long-term  support  of  State  tsunami  hazard  mapping  and  mitigation
programs.  We  recommend  that  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program
(NTHMP)  be  permanently  funded  at  the  level  of  at  least  $7.8  million  per  year  in
NOAA’s base budget, and that $390,000 per year of this support be allocated perma-
nently to each of the five Pacific states, Oregon, Washington, California, Alaska and
Hawaii  (a  total  of  about  $2  million  per  year)  to  support  long-term  tsunami  hazard
mapping,  intensive  education  programs,  and  the  strengthening  of  local  emergency
warning infrastructure.

Another challenge is building a strong infrastructure for warning the coastal pop-
ulation,  local  and  visitor,  about  distant  tsunami  threats  from  places  like  the  Aleu-
tians  and  South  America.  Distant  tsunamis  will  arrive  four  hours  or  more  after  a
tsunami-generating earthquake, so the current international warning system will be
effective  in  issuing  warnings.  Getting  the  warnings  to  everyone  on  every  beach
along the Oregon coast requires a comprehensive telecommunications system.

Administrative  challenges  include  working  with  minimal  funding  and  staffing  to
develop  the  tsunami  education  program—from  product  development  to  its  delivery
to the public/private sector and coastal citizens. Also local emergency managers are
over  loaded  with  DHS  requirements  making  it  sometimes  impossible  to  support
earthquake/tsunami programs—they must be given the funding to support resources
needed in the community for the development of a tsunami ready community.

Securing coastal borders of the U.S. should also be made a top priority of the new
Homeland Security Department. One of the most effective means of achieving high-
er  security  is  stationing  more  police  and  fire  responders  along  the  U.S.  coastline.
These responders are our first line of defense for both natural and manmade disas-
ters.  The  Oregon  coast  is  mostly  devoid  of  highway  patrol  officers,  fire  stations  are
sparsely  manned  (mostly  by  volunteers),  and  few  National  Guard  are  stationed  at
the coast; yet tens of thousands of visitors flock to the Oregon coastline from all over
the  U.S.  It  is  appropriate  that  the  Federal  Government  partner  with  the  State  of
Oregon  to  secure  this  border  and  thereby  facilitate  meaningful  emergency  response
to  tsunamis  from  both  distant  and  local  sources.  The  State  needs  direct  financial
federal  assistance  to  put  more  fire  and  police  personnel  on  the  coast,  especially  at
coastal ports.

The  other,  almost  overwhelming,  challenge  is  making  the  coastal  transportation
system  less  vulnerable  to  catastrophic  failure  due  to  a  local  earthquake  and  tsu-
nami.  Federal  Highway  101  was  built  in  the  1930’s  and  is  now  beyond  its  design
life.  Nearly  all  of  the  bridges  and  culverts  on  the  coast  highway  are  in  greater  or
lesser stages of deterioration. Given a 10–20 percent chance that a magnitude 9 un-
dersea  earthquake  and  tsunami  will  strike  the  Oregon,  Washington,  and  northern
California coast in the next 50 years, the current highway will be severely damaged
and many bridges destroyed, rendering emergency response nearly impossible. Fed-
eral  leadership  to  replace  key  vulnerable  bridges  along  the  coast  and  those  linking
the  coast  to  the  rest  of  the  state  is  a  vital  component  in  making  the  state  more  re-
sistant to this inevitable natural disaster.
2. What  is  your  opinion  of  NOAA’s  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation
Program  (NTHMP)  and  of  NOAA’s  Tsunami  Ready  program?  Why  are
there  so  few  communities  that  participate  in  the  Tsunami  Ready  pro-
gram and what can be done to increase participation?
NOAA’s  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  has  been  instrumental  in
increasing  the  capacity  of  the  five  member  states  to  conduct  tsunami  run  up  mod-
eling  and  mapping  and  to  tailor  tsunami  education  and  outreach  to  local  commu-
nities. Without this federally funded program and the State allocations, there would
be little, if any, tsunami programs in our states.

The  National  Weather  Service’s  TsunamiReady  program  is  an  excellent  incentive
for communities to reach at least a minimum standard of readiness. Reasons for so

few  participating  communities  could  be  that  this  is  a  relatively  new  program,  but
more importantly, program certification requires a large investment of time and re-
sources from the local communities. These investments include installing and main-
taining  emergency  notification  infrastructure,  evacuation  planning,  and  conducting
drills  and  education  activities.  Many  coastal  communities  have  limited  resources  to
carry out these program requirements.

Changing  behavior  and  attitudes  is  not  an  overnight  process  and  takes  many
years—therefore,  TsunamiReady  communities  will  come  on  line  as  products  are  de-
veloped  and  given  to  the  communities  and  awareness  and  preparedness  to  the  tsu-
nami hazard increases—the bottom line, the communities must buy-in to protecting
itself from this hazard, even at potential social and economic loss.

Since  meeting  the  program  criteria  is  a  local  responsibility,  TsunamiReady  par-
ticipation could be encouraged by the permanent increased allocation for the annual
tsunami budgets for the five states in the National Program as detailed earlier.
3. What roles do NOAA, USGS and FEMA play in your activities? How can

these agencies be more useful in your efforts?
NOAA and USGS have been invaluable partners for the states in providing finan-
cial, technological, and nationwide networking resources that have resulted in faster
and  more  accurate  warning  systems  for  distant  tsunami  events.  NOAA  has  also
been  helpful  in  providing  technical  assistance  for  tsunami  inundation  mapping,  as
well  as  offering  a  centralized  repository  for  computer  data  developed  from  mapping
of potential tsunami inundation on U.S. coasts. The Advanced National Seismic Sys-
tem  (ANSS)  of  the  USGS  provides  near  instant  determination  of  earthquakes.
FEMA has offered helpful advice and served in a key coordination role between the
states  and  other  federal  partners  in  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Pro-
gram (NTHMP).

All  of  these  federal  agencies  could  be  more  helpful  to  the  states  by  increasing  fi-
nancial  and  technological  support  to  amplify  what  the  states  do  best:  natural  haz-
ards  characterization,  mapping  tsunami  evacuation  zones  in  partnership  with  local
cities  and  counties,  emergency  response  guidance  to  local  government,  and  earth-
quake and tsunami education to the local populace.

FEMA could be a more active partner to the states by directly funding State miti-
gation  efforts,  including  preparedness  and  response  infrastructure  (telecommuni-
cations,  emergency  supply  caches,  State-federal  coordination  of  military  and  Coast
Guard  assets,  tsunami  flood  mapping  and  education).  Since  9/11  and  the  establish-
ment of DHS, FEMA’s ability to support tsunami efforts in the states has been con-
siderably  reduced  and  until  DHS  can  fully  develop  it’s  programs  and  funding
streams,  FEMA  who  has  a  very  high  stake  in  tsunami  response  and  recovery,  will
lag behind in its responsibilities to support State efforts.

NOAA would be more effective, if the parts of NOAA that do bathymetric surveys
would  give  the  highest  priority  to  surveys  of  those  parts  of  the  U.S.  coast  that  (1)
lack detailed bathymetric data, and (2) are most vulnerable to tsunami flooding. De-
tailed  bathymetry,  particularly  in  bays,  estuaries,  and  shallow  water  at  the  coast,
is one of the major data needs for the State tsunami hazard mapping programs.

USGS  would  greatly  aid  State  efforts  to  map  tsunami  inundation,  if  they  could
regularly  provide  comprehensive  digital  terrain  data  through  photogrammetry  or
airborne  laser  surveys  (LIDAR)  for  the  most  vulnerable  parts  of  the  U.S.  coastline
lacking  such  data.  This  data,  when  combined  with  the  bathymetry  from  NOAA,
would  empower  the  State  tsunami  mapping  teams  with  accurate  digital  elevation
data essential to accurate tsunami inundation mapping.

Additionally,  there  needs  be  better  research  on  the  nature  seismic  activity  be-
tween the subduction zone plates. Because of insufficient instrumentation along the
coast, the depth and characterization of earthquakes along the edge of the off shore
plate boundaries are not well understood.

USGS  and  NOAA  should  combine  their  resources  to  provide  24-hr/7-day-a-week
tsunami warnings from a single location that is relatively invulnerable to the large
earthquakes  and  tsunamis.  This  location  should  have  a  critical  mass  of  geologists,
geophysicists, and tsunami experts available to make instant, collaborative decisions
24  hours  a  day.  For  example,  a  collaborative  team  that  included  a  geologist  would
have  known  from  the  geology  of  the  Indonesian  coast  that  a  magnitude  8.5  to  9.0
earthquake at that particular location was most likely a subduction zone event that
would almost certainly generate a devastating tsunami. This knowledge base might
well  have  spurred  a  more  robust  warning  that  may  well  have  saved  thousands  of
lives.
4. Please  describe  inundation  maps.  How  important  are  they  to  your  abil-

ity to plan? Who prepares these maps and who pays for them?

In  1995,  Oregon  created  legislation  that  called  for  mapping  tsunami  inundation
zones,  that  includes  limitations  on  new  construction  and  require  tsunami  drills  in
K–12  schools.  Inundation  maps  are  prepared  in  Oregon  by  the  Oregon  Department
of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) in collaboration with NOAA and with
local partners in academia, principally the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and
Technology, Oregon Health Sciences University. DOGAMI publishes and widely dis-
tributes  the  maps  after  review  by  local  government  authorities,  technical  experts,
and  the  publication  staff.  The  inundation  maps  are  indispensable.  Without  them,
evacuation maps for complex areas such as estuaries and bays are mere guesswork.
The first three inundation maps done for Oregon were supported by a combination
of  USGS  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP)  funds,  State
funds,  and  NOAA  funding.  After  about  1997,  the  inundation  maps  were  supported
mainly by NOAA funds through the NTHMP with some support by the State (prin-
cipally labor in-kind contributions). With State budgets struggling to keep essential
public services like the K–12 schools open, there is virtually no likelihood that these
specialized  mapping  projects  would  have  been  supported  through  State  or  local
funds.

NTHMP has also funded the creation and printing of local evacuation maps, pro-
duced from inundation maps. These maps are then distributed as free brochures by
local  government.  Depending  on  the  resources  available  to  local  communities,  some
jurisdictions  continue  printing  the  brochures,  while  others,  particularly  unincor-
porated  rural  communities,  often  need  continuing  financial  aid  in  order  to  provide
these  valuable  products  to  visitors  and  the  local  population.  Federal  funding  from
NTHMP  to  the  State  tsunami  mitigation  programs  has  empowered  the  states  to
standardize  the  evacuation  map  brochures  and  reprint  brochures  for  these  rural
communities.
5. What  is  your  opinion  of  the  Administration’s  new  proposal  to  improve
the  U.S.’s  tsunami  detection  and  warning  programs?  Are  there  ways  it
can be improved, and if so, what are they?
The  Administration’s  proposed  detection  and  warning  system  is  essential  for
issuance  of  world  wide  warnings  about  large  distant  (trans-oceanic)  tsunami.  The
Administration’s  proposal  may  be  more  technically  robust,  and  perhaps  more  cost
effective,  if  the  probabilities  of  various  tsunami  sources  were  fully  evaluated  prior
to  final  buoy  siting.  This  inexpensive  initial  research  would  enable  NOAA  to  place
the  buoy  detectors  in  optimal  locations  to  effectively  minimize  population  exposure
to  potential  tsunami  threats.  It  may  result  that  fewer  buoys  than  are  currently
being proposed would be required. NOAA or the National Academy of Science could
sponsor a panel of experts to review the final buoy site recommendations.

It  is  critical  to  note  that  the  current  buoy  network  and  Administration’s  ocean-
wide  buoy  program  would  do  little  to  nothing  to  limit  loss  of  life  in  coastal  areas
that  are  right  next  to  tsunami-generating  earthquakes  faults.  Travel  time  from  the
Cascadia earthquake source to the U.S. west coast is too short for the proposed sys-
tem  to  operate  effectively.  In  fact,  the  existing  buoys  are  designed  and  located  to
only detect and measure outgoing tsunami.

Oregon communities at the coastline have 10 to 30 minutes to react and evacuate
following  a  probable  magnitude  9  Cascadia  Subduction  Zone  earthquake.  The  most
cost-effective  means  of  limiting  loss  of  life  from  locally  produced  tsunamis  is  map-
ping  where  the  dangerous  areas  are  and  then  implementing  a  long-term,  relentless
public education campaign aimed at developing the ‘‘culture of awareness’’ that will
cause  people  to  leave  these  dangerous  areas  when  they  feel  a  large  earthquake  at
the  coast.  Empowering  local  government  and  the  coastal  states  to  implement  this
work is the most effective means of solving the problem.

Financial  and  scientific  support  should  also  be  dedicated  to  develop  innovative
new warning technologies able to detect and warn of locally produced tsunamis from
submarine  landslides  and  from  ‘‘silent’’  or  ‘‘slow’’  earthquakes  that  result  little  or
no  shaking.  Educating  people  to  respond  when  the  Earth  shakes  does  not  work  for
these  events.  Complementary  to  developing  these  new  warning  technologies  is  the
requirement  to  conduct  a  geological  assessment  of  the  potential  for  these  types  of
tsunami-generating  sources  on  the  U.S.  coastline.  These  assessments  could  be  com-
pleted via cooperative applied research projects performed by State geologic surveys
and funded by the U.S. Geological Survey.
Conclusion

I have just returned from the 1st International Conference on Urban Disaster Re-
duction in Kobe, Japan and participated in two days of work sessions with my tsu-
nami program counter parts from Japan. Our joint recommendations focused on the
need to increase our level of confidence in the technology we rely on, translate more

research  into  direct  application,  and  increase  our  investment  in  the  ‘‘culture  of
awareness.’’ Considering the history of Japan’s tsunami countermeasures, it is vali-
dating  to  see  we  have  universal  concerns  about  our  respective  societies’  needed  di-
rection for higher safety.

The proposed increase in tsunami buoys, coupled with an expanded seismic moni-
toring network will greatly enhance our nations ability to detect and warn of poten-
tial  distant  tsunami  strikes.  But  the  NOAA  DART  buoy  network  does  not  provide
adequate  warning  time  for  near  shore  tsunami.  In  fact,  it  is  critical  not  to  rely  on
their  warning  in  the  event  of  a  near  shore  earthquake,  since  so  little  time  is  avail-
able for evacuation.

Please  understand  that  supporting  each  of  the  Pacific  state’s  tsunami  programs
is  the  most  effective  way  to  build  the  ‘‘culture  of  awareness’’  necessary  for  prompt
evacuation  before  local  tsunami  and  for  the  notification  infrastructure  necessary  to
deliver warnings of approaching distant tsunami.

Thank you.

DISCUSSION

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Wilson.
For  Dr.  Groat  and  General  Johnson,  testimony  indicated  that
there is as much as a 20 percent chance of an earthquake as large
as last month’s occurring on the Pacific Northwest coast of the U.S.
within  the  next  50  years.  Does  the  Pacific  coast  of  the  U.S.  face  a
greater  risk  from  tsunami  generated  right  off  shore,  for  example,
the Cascadia subduction zone, or from those generated from farther
away?  If  the  greater  danger  is  closer  to  shore,  to  what  extent  will
the  expanded  detection  system  the  Administration  is  proposing  be
of assistance?
Dr. Groat.
Dr.  GROAT.  Chairman,  from  a  seismic  hazard  point  of  view,  the
threat  of  a  very  large  earthquake  of  the  kind  that  you  described
close  to  shore  and  that  Mr.  Wilson  was  concerned  about  how  we
deal with the impacts of that is probably at least as likely as some-
thing  generated  further  away  that  would  come  in  at  great  dis-
tances.  That  is  a  very  tectonically  active  part  of  the  plate  system.
And as far as the U.S. is concerned, with the exception of a smaller
area  in  the  Caribbean,  is  the  area  we  need  to  be  the  most  con-
cerned  about,  so  I  don’t  think  we  can  afford  to  put  all  our  eggs  in
any  one  basket.  We  have  to  be  worried  about  the  long-term—long-
distance  tsunamis  that  the  NOAA  system  is  intended  to  provide
warnings  about  and  find  measures,  as  Mr.  Wilson  described,  to
deal  with  the  very  real  likelihood  that  a  large  earthquake  on  the
plate  boundary  will  happen  within  a  foreseeable  time  and  to  pro-
vide the adequate measures to respond to that.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  the  sophisticated  technology  that  we
have all be talking about wouldn’t have time to be operative there.
You have got to have a good education system, which speaks to the
nature  for  a  comprehensive  system,  not  just  buoys  some  place  out
there  in  the  Pacific  or  down  in  the  Caribbean,  but  we  have  got  to
have  a  good  education  system  so  that  the  Tilly’s  of  the  world  can
see something and understand what is happening.
General Johnson, do you want to address that?

88

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Yes,  sir.  I  agree  100  percent.  When
you  have  the  earthquake  trigger,  the  tsunami  wave  is  generated
and  goes  both  ways.  And  if  it  is  right  off  your  coast,  it  comes  to-
wards your coast, and you have those precious minutes with which
to  react.  That  is  why  I  agree  that  an  education  program  has  to  be
part of a comprehensive, end-to-end system. If you buy a buoy, you
have  got  a  buoy.  If  you  buy  a  system,  an  end-to-end  system,  you
have  education  that  will  enable  people  to  react  in  those  precious
early minutes.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  why  does  just  about  all  of  the  re-
sources  go  to  buoys?  I  mean,  if  I  see  one  deficiency,  and  I  don’t
want  to  say  a  deficiency,  but  I  think  there  should  be  some  more
emphasis  in  a  comprehensive  plan  on  education  than  there  is.  We
applaud  the  emphasis  on  technology.  You  might  expect  that  from
this Science Committee, and that is critically important. But there
has  to  be  something  more  in  the  area  of  education,  as  Mr.  Wilson
points out.

Brigadier General JOHNSON. Sir, I agree that education is a very
important  part,  but  you  will  note  that  water  is  a  very  efficient
transmitter  of  energy.  And  the  tsunami-generation  zones  are  the
Pacific  Rim  in  its  entirety.  And  we  are,  in  fact,  part  of  the  entire
planet,  and  the  things  that  happen  over  there  can  affect  us  here.
So  having  sensor  systems  over  there  as  well  as  here  make  us  part
of a comprehensive, worldwide program. We also need to pay atten-
tion to the Atlantic and the Caribbean as well.

Chairman BOEHLERT. So———
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  It  is  a  smaller  probability  of  occur-

rence, but with potentially devastating consequences.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  could  either  of  you,  then,  shed  some
light on what the plan is in education? Is there sufficient evidence
to indicate that we are giving it the proper attention?

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  I  think  that  a  lot  of  people—sir,  I
will  take  it  first,  if  that  is  okay.  I  think  a  lot  of  people  have
tsunamis  in  the  middle  of  their  cross-check  right  now.  My  concern
is, as time goes on, people will lose that awareness. I think we need
to codify the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, get the
hazard  inundation  mapping  accomplished  so  we  know  where  we
can  go  when  we  decide  to  evacuate.  We  need  to  build  the  systems
now to enable us to detect those trigger events and tell people that
they do need to evacuate. We need to be able to communicate that
to  people.  And  if  it  happens  on  the  Cascadia  fault  zone,  it  is  very
probable,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  a  lot  of  the  infrastructure  that  we
are  depending  on  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  the  earthquake
itself.  I  mean,  the  radio  towers  and  those  kinds  of  things  that
would  help  us  disseminate  those  words  may  or  may  not  be  oper-
ational  at  that  point.  But  I  think  a  comprehensive  system  that  in-
cludes the readiness program is certainly part of a prudent system
that this nation ought to adopt.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  plan  advanced  thus  far,  and  I—once
again,  let  me  say  I  applaud  the  Administration  for  its  initiative.
And we are going to be fully supportive and then some.

Brigadier General JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. But how about education? In general, what

amount of those resources———

89

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  I  have  got  $1.5  million  in  the  pro-
posal  to  cover  inundation  mapping,  the  TsunamiReady  Program
and outreach. Sir, this is a level of effort thing. If additional dollars
are  available,  we  could  do  additional  mapping  and  have  a  greater
level———

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Does  that  pass  the  test  of  adequacy?  $1.5
million  in  this  town  is  tip  money.  I  mean,  I  don’t  mean  to  pose  as
a  big  spender,  and  you  know,  the  heck  with  what  anybody  else
says,  you  are  going  to  deal  with  this  program,  because  it  is  in  my
zone  of  interest  and  you  are  going  to  provide  some  adequacy  in
funding, but $1.5 million?

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  $1.5  million  in  2007  and  then  $1
million  sustained  through  the  outyears,  sir.  That  is  the  current
proposal.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Okay. Well, maybe we can take the current

proposal———

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  I  am  sorry.  I  misstated.  That  is
2005  and  2006  and  then  2007  and  beyond  would  be  the  $1  million
sustained.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Dr.  Groat,  do  you  want  to  add  something?
Dr.  GROAT.  Yeah.  I  think  Mr.  Wilson  made  an  eloquent  case  for
the most effective way to educate people in areas at risk, and that
is by providing State and local governments with the resources nec-
essary to do exactly the kind of work that he outlined. The Federal
Government can play a role in getting those funds to the right peo-
ple.  The  actual  education  effort  comes  best  from  those  who  are  in
the  affected  areas,  and  it  is  our  responsibility,  I  think,  to  make
sure  that  the  resources  and  the  technical  information  that  they
need  to  make  those  plans  is  available,  because  they  are  the  con-
tinuity.  They  are  the  ones  who  keep  things  moving.  The  difficulty
with  natural  hazards  is  we  forget  between  events.  And  the———
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  really  have  15  communities  that  are

TsunamiReady———
Dr. GROAT. Exactly.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—and that are certified, and in all fairness
to  people  at  State  and  local  government,  they  say  we  keep  getting
these  instructions,  mandates,  if  you  will,  from  Washington,  and
they are—in our light and self-interest to address them, but where
are we going to get the resources?

Dr. GROAT. The resources are critical, Mr. Chairman. There is no
question.  And  unless  the  emphasis  is  put  on  those  resources  that
go  for  that  purpose,  it  is  going  to  be  difficult  to  do,  because  they
are  as  resource-dependent  as  the  rest  of  us  are,  and  Mr.  Wilson
may have some thoughts about the best way to make that happen.

Mr. WILSON. Thank you, Dr. Groat.
Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  currently  embarking  on  a  pilot  program
in  the  city  of  Seaside,  Oregon,  and  it  is  a  new  approach  that  we
are trying to do, public—community outreach at a very grass roots
level. We have gotten funding through the National Tsunami Haz-
ard Mitigation Program and FEMA to hire a person who is working
a  little  over  half-time  as  an  on-the-ground  coordinator.  We  are
doing  surveys  before  and  after  an  outreach  program  that  we  are
conducting  to  try  and  assess  just  how  effective  our  messaging  and
outreach  capacity  is  to  try  and  develop  a  more  model  approach  for

other  communities  on  the  coast.  But  I  think  what  we  are  finding
in this particular program, this pilot program, is the outreach tools
that  we  have  in  place  are  effective,  but  what  we  don’t  have  is  the
person on the ground to do the face time with the local community,
someone  who  is  there,  someone  who  can  basically  do  a  block-by-
block  type  awareness  campaign.  I  think,  you  know,  there  is  a  lot
that  comes  out  of  the  national  funding  that  promotes  the  warning
system  and  even  the  infrastructure  for  disseminating  an  alert,  but
it  is  really  on  the  ground  that  people  have  to  know  what  to  do.
They  have  to  rehearse  these  drills  during  the  daytime  so  at  2:00
in  the  morning,  at  night,  they  know  where  they  need  to  go.  There
is  so  much  that  we  try  to  help  our  locals  with  on  the  ground  and
they all have limited resources.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  My  time  is  expired,  and  I  want  to  try  to
stick  to  the  time  limits  so  we  give  everyone  an  opportunity  to  ask
questions.

We will go to Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As usual, I think you and I are headed pretty much in the same
direction.  As  I  said  earlier  in  my  statement,  I  support  the  goal  of
this program, and I also want to applaud the swiftness with which
the Administration has brought this to us. But I have got two con-
cerns  about  the  proposed  budget.  First,  we  have  had—little  infor-
mation  has  been  provided  about  the  funds  needed  to  sustain  a
functional,  end-to-end  Tsunami  Warning  System  once  it  is  built.
And second, what are the offsets for the additional spending in the
President’s  proposal?  Dr.  Orcutt  and  Dr.  Lerner-Lam  both  ex-
pressed  a  concern  about  sustainability  of  funds  for  annual  oper-
ation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  system.  And  additionally,  Dr.
Orcutt  indicated  a  current  operation  and  maintenance  shortfall  of
the  GS  network  of  about  $5  million.  So  Dr.  Groat  and  General
Johnson,  what  are  your  estimates  of  the  annual  operation  and
maintenance of the system? And when I say that, I don’t—I am not
trying to get you in trouble, but what I would like to do is ask you,
you  know,  what  is  a  realistic  budget,  not  what  it  has  been  budg-
eted? And I say that because if we are to seek additional funds, we
would like to do this in an informed way.

Dr.  GROAT.  Speaking  on  behalf  of  the  seismic  network,  as  Dr.
Orcutt  mentioned,  there  is  a  need  for  investment  in  additional  in-
strumentation.  But  as  you  have  pointed  out,  the  need  to  maintain
that instrumentation and keep it current is extremely high to keep
it up and keep it operating.

Mr.  GORDON.  Yeah,  we  have  got  three  that  aren’t  working  right

now in the—you know, so———

Dr. GROAT. In the buoy system, but———
Mr. GORDON. So correct———
Dr. GROAT.—we have similar problems with our seismometers.
Mr. GORDON. Yeah.
Dr.  GROAT.  They  do  go  down,  and  we  have  to  maintain  those,
and  those  of  us  that  operate  those  systems,  both  the  University  of
California,  San  Diego,  and  USGS  have  difficulty  in  lean  budget
years  keeping  the  funds  to  maintain  the  systems  adequate.  I  am
encouraged, though, Mr. Gordon, in what we know up to this point
about  the  President’s  proposal  for  keeping  the  system  fed  with

funds  to  maintain  the  system  we  have  designed  in  the  outyears,
2006  and  beyond.  Unless  we  are  surprised,  I  think  there  will  be  a
recognition that that kind of funding is needed and that we will re-
ceive  the  money  necessary  to  maintain  the  system  that  we  have
implemented. And you asked———

Mr.  GORDON.  I  am  sorry.  I  mean,  are  you—did  you  say  that  you
think  that  there  is  an  adequate  amount  being  budgeted  now  or
that  you  think  it  will  be  recognized  later  and  more  will  be  added?
I didn’t———

Dr.  GROAT.  No,  I  think  that  there  is  an  adequate  amount  being
budgeted  now  for  2006,  2007,  and  beyond  to  maintain  the  kind  of
system  that  we  have  described,  the  incremental  addition  to  it  and
then the maintenance necessary to make sure that system is func-
tioning  in  the  future.  Now  does  it  solve  all  of  our  delayed  mainte-
nance  kinds  of  problems  and  so  forth?  Not  necessarily.  But  unlike
some  immediate  responses  to  significant  events  like  this  where
there is a big spike in funding and then nothing in the future, and
then we do have the very problems you described, there is the rec-
ognition  that  those  funds  to  maintain  the  system  are  necessary.
There is the budgeting of those funds, and we are comfortable that
we have taken a major step in making sure that happens.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  is  that  both  from  mapping  and  public  edu-

cation rather than just for maintenance of the network?

Dr.  GROAT.  In  our  case,  it  is  principally  for  maintaining  the  up-
graded  system  at  the  National  Earthquake  Information  Center.  It
provides  some  funds  to  continue  the  mapping  efforts.  It  provides
some funds to maintain the system that we have now in place.

Mr. GORDON. Some funds or adequate funds?
Dr. GROAT. I think, Mr. Gordon, that they are adequate funds at
the level that the system is being deployed. Now I could make some
arguments  that  we  need  a  broader  system  and  a  more  dense  sys-
tem,  particularly  in  the  case  of  something  like  the  Advanced  Na-
tional Seismic System, and in that case, any surge of funds to build
the  instruments,  put  the  instruments  in  place,  would  need  to  be
matched  with  additional  funds  for  maintenance.  We  have  not  re-
quested,  nor  are  we  anticipating  receiving,  that  level  of  funding  at
this time.

Mr.  GORDON.  Okay.  And  I  am  concerned  that—on  a  couple
things. One, that you apparently don’t have adequate funds now for
maintenance  or  you  would  be—when  I  say  doing  a  better  job,  I
mean, I don’t—I am not trying to—you can only do what you have
funds for. But it apparently is not being adequately performed now.
And  I  am  concerned  about  that.  I  am  also  concerned  about  is  this
going  to  result  in  additional  offsets?  You  know,  for  example,  with
the  tornado  warning  system  now,  I  mean,  I  think  there  are  some
technologies  out  there  that  you  know  about  that  if  it  was  brought
on  board,  it  would  give  us  a  better  system  for  technology.  But  you
can’t afford to do that. So you know, are we just making a difficult
and inadequate budget worse with this?

Dr.  GROAT.  Well,  let  me—I  will  turn  it  over  to  General  Johnson
in  just  a  second  for  the  NOAA’s  point  of  view.  From  our  point  of
view,  with  the  seismic  system,  the  interpretation  of  data,  the  dis-
semination of data, the increased funds to do that more adequately

and to maintain that, we don’t anticipate at this time that we will
have to offset other programs to make that happen.

Mr. GORDON. Good.
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  With  regard  to  NOAA  and  the  sus-
taining  of  the  buoy  and  tide  gauge  network  as  well  as  the  inunda-
tion  mapping,  we  have  programmed  money  to  acquire  them  using
the 2005 supplemental and the 2006 President’s budget top-line in-
crease.  For  the  2007  to  2011  time  frame,  NOAA  is  going  through
that budget process right now. I have got commitments from Admi-
ral  Lautenbacher  to  address  the  tsunami  tail  to  sustain  that.  I
have  already  highlighted  to  him  that  it  is  $3.75  million  for  the
buoys,  a  quarter  of  a  million  dollars  for  the  tide  gauges  and
ongoing———

Chairman BOEHLERT. $3.75 million for the buoys?
Brigadier General JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. For acquiring new ones?
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  No,  sir;  to  maintain  the—a  25
array—25  buoy  array  in  the  Pacific,  which  will  be  installed  in  the
beginning of 2007.

Chairman BOEHLERT. What we have right now, if I may———
Brigadier General JOHNSON. We have six right now.
Chairman BOEHLERT. We have six buoys———
Brigadier General JOHNSON. Yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—in the Pacific. Now three of them are not

Brigadier General JOHNSON. Right.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Now  I  am  a  baseball  fan.  If  you  bat  0.500
in baseball, you are doing pretty good. There is a little place in my
District  called  Cooperstown  where  I  can  get  you  admission  if  you
bat  0.500.  But  when  only  three  of  six  are  working—functioning
properly  right  now  in  a  warning  detection  system,  that  doesn’t  get
you in anybody’s hall of fame.

Brigadier General JOHNSON. Yes, sir. They are the first six going
to  an  eventual  29-buoy  array.  They  are  transitioning  from  the  re-
search  and  development  phase  into  operations.  And  you  are  right;
we  have  three  of  them  that  are  down  right  now.  Can  I  have  back-
up slide 11?

Mr. GORDON. And I assume they are down because the money to

operative.

have the ship time to go out and take care of them?

Brigadier General JOHNSON. No, sir.
Mr. GORDON. Okay.
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Some  of  the  problem  revolves
around having a—we had one buoy that had a battery problem out
here, and when we went out to service it and pick it up, the cavity
in the buoy had an over-pressure indication and we had a little ex-
plosion on the buoy. We are in the process—we had a safety stand-
down.  We  modified  the  six  other  buoys  to  have  a  pressure-relief
valve in. We also came across some water intrusion into cabling on
the  new  buoys  and  are  in  the  process  of  upgrading  cables.  That  is
this  damage  right  here.  And  then  people  from  that  part  of  the  Pa-
cific will tell you that from about November to about March, weath-
er  is  definitely  a  hazard.  And  to  bear  that  out,  in  December,  we
went  out  to  service  a  buoy  in  conditions  that  were  marginal.  We
were—we  felt  the  need  to  pursue  that  before  this  event  happened.

We  were  out  there  to  service  it  and  actually  dinged  one  of  the
buoys  because  of  the  condition  of  the  seas.  So  NOAA  is  not  sitting
back.  You  know,  we  are  actively  trying  to  transition  these  into  op-
erations  and  build  the  redundancy  that  was  brought  up  earlier  in
those areas where weather is going to be a consistent factor.

Mr.  GORDON.  Thank  you.  I  guess—do  any  other  witnesses  want
to  make  a  quick,  very  quick  comment  on  any  concerns  about  any
cannibalizing  of  other  programs  in  terms  of  being  adequately  able
to do the operation and maintenance with the funds proposed?

Dr. ORCUTT. I might just comment briefly. The part of the world
that Eddie Bernard here is working in at the moment is one of the
worst  possible  places  to  try  to  do  this  job.  The  weather  is  terrible
there almost all of the time, and to ask these—it is asking a great
deal of these small buoys to perform at 100 percent of the time, so
the  weather  is  certainly  something  that  has  a  great  deal  going
against  you  in  that  environment.  But  the  issue  is  whether  there
are  sufficient  funds  in  the  long-term.  And  in  a  way,  we  can’t  an-
swer  that  after  fiscal  year  2007,  but  the  costs  are  significant.  You
can  replace  the  capitol  investment  in  a  matter  of  a  few  years,  be-
cause of the maintenance required.

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  May  I  make  one  additional  point,

Mr. Chairman?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Sure, General.
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  The  current  buoys  are  kind  of  the
first  generation,  and  we  envision  deploying  a  second  generation
that will enable two-way communication, include some of these re-
liability  and  maintaining  improvements  that  Dr.  Bernard’s  great
design,  that  has  already  proven  its  worth.  So  when  we  build  the
new  system,  it  should  be  a  much  better  system  that  has  the  built-
in redundancy. Thank you.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Ms. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
General  Johnson,  and  you  would  probably  say  that  the  problem
with  the  buoys  could  be  with  the  contractor,  with  the  technology,
and with funding? All three of those together?

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  I  think  that  NOAA  experiences
challenges when we transition good ideas from research and devel-
opment  into  things  that  are  going  to  be  operationalized  and,  you
know,  routinely  counted  on  for  long  periods  of  time.  You  know,  in
a  perfect  world,  we  would  be  able  to  service  the  buoys  once  a  year
and be done with it and have nothing go wrong. And with the next
generation buoy, we are looking at having some built-in test indica-
tors  into  it,  some  additional  redundancies,  and  those  kinds  of
things.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you.
Let  me  then  just  move  to  another  question.  On  December  26,  I
think  it  was  reported  that  two  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  Centers
knew  of  the  high  likelihood  that  a  tsunami  had  been  generated,
given  the  magnitude  of  the  earthquake.  Why  wasn’t  that  reported
immediately  to  the  State  Department  or  someone  that  could  do
something  to  inform  them  so  that  other  nations  would  know  that
they were in danger?

94

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  The  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Sys-
tem worked as it was designed, which was to alert the 26 member
nations  of  that  consortium  of  the  possible  impact.  Now  the  Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center is right there in Hawaii, and they also—
when  they  became  aware  that  there  was  a  tsunami  wave  associ-
ated  with  the  earthquake,  did  take  steps  to  do  additional  notifica-
tion. I would hasten to point out that many times significant earth-
quakes  do  not  generate  tsunamis.  That  is  one  of  the  reasons  we
need to do some more modeling effort and work with our colleagues
over  at  USGS  the  why-fors  and  the  how-comes  there.  But  at  the
time,  ma’am,  when  we  figured  out,  through  press  reports,  because
we  were  blind,  because  we  had  no  sensors  in  the  Indian  Ocean,
there  is  no  possibility  of  knowing  at  that  point  whether  the  wave
was  associated  with  a  big  earthquake  or  not,  it  was  already  past
Indonesia  and  Thailand  and  Sri  Lanka  and  was  affecting  the  east
coast of India. And the next big landfall was Diego Garcia, and the
Center  did,  in  fact,  call  Diego  Garcia.  The  Pacific  fleet  has  signifi-
cant  presence  in  and  around  Diego  Garcia,  and  we  did  have  con-
sultations with the State Department Operations Center for Mada-
gascar,  and  we  have  instituted  and  codified  that  procedure  so  that
now,  whenever  that  happens,  we  are  notifying  the  State  Depart-
ment,  and  we  are  also  putting  out  notification  through  the  stand-
ard  World  Meteorological  Organization  weather  channels  that  are
well established to the countries.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Let  me,  maybe,  ask  the  panel  what  are  greatest
challenges  to  establishing  a  global  Tsunami  Warning  System.  And
what role should the U.S. play? And does the Administration’s plan
accomplish that role?

Dr.  GROAT.  Let  me  just  take  a  quick  shot.  And  I  think  the
GEOSS  process  was  mentioned,  the  Global  Earth  Observing  Sys-
tem  of  Systems  in  which  the  U.S.  and  55—54  other  nations  play
a  significant  role.  I  think  the  Administration  sees  that  organiza-
tion,  which,  as  was  pointed  out,  meets  in  Brussels  on  the  16th  of
February,  as  the  place  to  bring  the  international  community  to-
gether  to  design,  perhaps,  its  first  truly  global  system  that  meets
societal  needs,  which  is  what  the  intent  of  that  whole  program  is.
And the U.S. role in that, Admiral Lautenbacher is one of the four
co-chairs,  would  be  to  provide  some  of  the  leadership  in  the  tech-
nology and in the application of that technology. But as you might
expect,  as  a  result  of  the  event  on  December  26,  international
groups all over the world are coming together. There was a meeting
in  Beijing  just  recently,  and  there  is  another  one  in  Thailand  in  a
week  or  so,  to  talk  about  how  they,  in  their  regions,  can  do  this.
The  real  challenge  is  going  to  be  to  turn  this  into  a  true  system
of  systems  so  that  warnings  are  spread  around  to  the  people  that
need  them  in  an  effective  way,  rather  than  in  a  fragmented  sort
of  way.  So  I  think  the  GEOSS  approach,  which  brings  the  whole
community  together,  is  the  real  opportunity  to  bind  these  systems
in truly a system that works for everybody.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you.
Would anybody else like to comment?
Dr.  LERNER-LAM.  I  will  simply  add  that  I  agree  with  those  com-
ments,  but  in  my  mind,  in  terms  of  a  global  warning  system,  local
engagement  is,  perhaps,  the  least  understood  component  of  this.

What  do  we  do  with  the  warning  once  it  is  issued?  I  think  some
of the technical and research problems are well on their way to so-
lution.  I  would  merely  add  that  end-to-end,  however,  includes  ev-
erything  from  the  basic  research  of  these  great,  giant  events
through  the  operational  component,  all  of  the  way  to  the  local  en-
gagement.  We  have  seen  some  testimony  about  how  that  might
occur  in  the  United  States.  A  coordinated  international  plan,  how-
ever, is lacking.

Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Wilson.
Mr.  WILSON.  I  just  have  a  quick  addition  to  that.  One  of  the
things  that  we  are  really  working  on  in  the—on  the  Oregon  coast
is  notification  to  visitors,  to  tourists.  The  vulnerability  of  the  tour-
ists  in  Thailand  was  a  good  example  of  how  people  who  were  on
vacation  who  are  not  a  part  of  the  local  culture  are  not  thinking
about  their  surroundings.  In  terms  of  evacuation  in  areas  that  are
tourist areas, vertical evacuation versus inland evacuation is some-
thing  that  is  being  researched  and  considered.  The  types  of  struc-
tures  that  could  survive  a  local  magnitude  9  earthquake  and  then
still  be  able  to  provide  vertical  evacuation  for  seniors,  for  the  dis-
abled, the people who can not get out of harms way with a limited
evacuation  time.  I  would  just  say  that  for  a  larger,  more  com-
prehensive tsunami system, this is also something that needs to be
considered.

Chairman BOEHLERT. General Johnson.
Ms. BIGGERT. Yes, General?
Brigadier General JOHNSON. Dr. Lerner-Lam’s chart of mortality
due to severe environmental effects was telling. The United States
was  a  conspicuously  non-shaded  area.  We,  on  average,  experience
10,000  severe  thunderstorms  a  year,  over  1,000  tornadoes.  We  set
a  new  record  this  year  for  1,700  tornadoes,  and  we  usually  experi-
ence about six hurricanes a year.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  It  made  flying  to  Washington  very  difficult  some-

times. Yes.

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Yes,  ma’am.  And  for  that,  I  apolo-

gize, on behalf of the Lord.

However,  the  reason  that  is  an  unshaded  area  is  because  we
have an integrated data-sharing system between all of the different
sensor networks, not only for tsunamis, but for weather events, and
this is the kind of benefit that our planet needs. The GEOSS is the
tool to address not only tsunamis, but severe weather and environ-
mental effects worldwide and we have got a wonderful opportunity
with  the  attention  of  the  world  focused  right  now  to  capitalize  on
this opportunity. Thanks.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
General  Johnson,  just  out  of  curiosity,  going  back  through  re-
corded  history,  is  there  any  time  when  an  earthquake  of  the  mag-
nitude  of  this  one,  9.0  on  the  Richter  scale,  did  not  cause  a  tsu-
nami? Not all earthquakes cause tsunami. You know, it depends on
the magnitude. But has there ever been any point in history when
something of this magnitude failed to result in———

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Yeah.  I  think  USGS  has  some  ex-
amples  of  things  that  happened  just  weeks  before  the  tsunami
event. But it is very complicated. You know, you have to be off the

coast. It needs to be in the water. Usually, it is created because of
that  up-thrust  in  the  subduction  zone  or  maybe  a  meteorite  or
maybe a landslide, that kind of a thing.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  But  a  9.0—I  mean,  the  simple  answer  to

my question is yes, depending on the circumstances, or———

Dr.  GROAT.  I  think  if  there  were  a  9  earthquake  of  the  mechan-
ical type that General Johnson mentioned with the thrusting in an
ocean basin margin, the likelihood is almost 1:1 that it would gen-
erate a tsunami. Part of our record in the past, while through map-
ping  of  deposits  on  coasts  that—where  tsunamis  have  brought
those  deposits  on  the  shoreline,  is  that  we  don’t  have  the  com-
parable  record  of  the  exact  earthquake  event  that  caused  it  and
therefore  don’t  know  the  magnitude.  So  there  is  not  necessarily
something magic about 9. It could be a smaller earthquake. I mean,
8s or 7.5s could possibly generate tsunamis of significance.

Chairman BOEHLERT. When did we know it was 9?
Dr. GROAT. When?
Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah.
Dr.  GROAT.  It  took  a  while,  because,  again,  back  to  our  seismic
station  density,  it—certain  waves—the  surface  waves  have  to  get
to you to do the kind of analysis that is needed to make the inten-
sity.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Minutes? Hours?
Dr.  GROAT.  Hours,  in  some  cases.  We  get  the  early  waves,  and
we get a preliminary analysis, and we generate it in an assumption
that it was in the neighborhood of an 8. It wasn’t until the surface
waves  arrived  at  enough  stations  that  we  could  interpret  data,
which was a matter of at least an hour, wasn’t it Dave?

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON. 

It  was  an  hour  and 

five

minutes———

Dr. GROAT. An hour and five minutes.
Brigadier General JOHNSON.—later, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. GROAT. That we knew that it was a 9.
Chairman BOEHLERT. And when—I don’t———
Brigadier General JOHNSON. 8.5, yeah. We updated it, and it was
actually academic institutions and much later that it turned out to
be 9.

Chairman BOEHLERT. I can understand what was happening and
maybe  a  lot  of  people  doing  a  lot  of  things,  but  why  seven  hours
to notification of the State Department?

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Sir,  it  was  a  long  time  before  we

had high confidence that there was a wave associated with it.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So  you  didn’t  want  to  give  a  false  alarm,

because you don’t———

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  We  experienced—from  the  forma-
tion  of  the  Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  in  1949,  we  had  a  75
percent false alarm rate. After the inception of the buoy system, we
have a very small sample size, but we don’t have a false alarm rate
to date. Yes, sir, there is a high probability that there is a tsunami
wave associated with an earthquake of that magnitude, but it isn’t
a complete certainty. I think my guys were waiting to get some in-
dications of that fact.

Dr.  GROAT.  Just  to  point  out,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  certain  types
of earthquakes that are generated by slippage this way can be very

nology?

large, can be 8s or so, in coastal areas and don’t generate tsunamis.
So  we  really  do  have  to  have  that  complete  analysis  of  data  that
is  enhanced  by  a  more  dense  system,  more  real-time  data,  to  pro-
vide  that  kind  of  information  that  it  is  or  isn’t  tsunamigenic  as
quickly as possible.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Which argues for more investment in tech-

Dr. GROAT. It does in that case, yes, sir.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Wu.
Mr. WU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  would  like  to  follow  up  on  some  of  your  questions  and  the

Ranking Member’s questions.

I have great respect for the professionalism of all of your people,
but  I  have  to  ask  the  obvious  question  that—the  fact  that  this
earthquake  occurred  at  roughly  8:00  p.m.  Eastern  Standard  Time
on Christmas Day, did that have anything to do with slowing down
the notification process?

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Sir,  I  was  very  lucky.  I  had  a  very
dedicated guy who was in the office at 3:00 p.m. Honolulu time, or
2:59,  and  that  is  why  we  were  able  to  get  the  message  out  to  the
member countries as quickly as we did. It was 3 minutes before he
got  the  initial  message  out  after  his  notification.  So  it  was  very,
very  timely.  Now  with  the  proposal  that  the  Administration  has
made, we increased to 24/7. We are not 24/7 right now. We are one
shift during the day, and then we have got beepers on people, and
I  have  kind  of  set  up  a  5-minute  response  time  to  get  in  the  office
and  be  able  to  send  the  pre-loaded  messages,  if  an  event  happens.
But we are taking this opportunity in funding to remedy that situ-
ation, sir.

Mr. WU. Does anyone else have anything to add to that?
Dr. ORCUTT. I would just like to comment. It has been mentioned
a  bit  before,  but  I  think  today  it  is  possible  to  bring  an  awful  lot
of  this  together  more  closely  using  modern  information  technology
to  do  these  things.  One  of  the  reasons  for  recommending  satellite
telemetry is so that the latency in the delivery of data to the NEIC,
for  example,  is  in  the  order  of  a  few  seconds.  That  kind  of  latency
ought  to  also  characterize  communications  with  the  Center  and
NOAA,  with  many  people,  including  academia  that  are  also  in-
volved in these things. The magnitude 9 did come from an analysis,
in fact, I believe at Harvard. These things ought to be linked more
closely together to reduce that length of time that we have here of
an hour or an hour and a quarter for notification to something that
is on the order of substantially less than an hour. That—more seis-
mic  stations  can  mean  you  might  be  able  to  get  this  job  done  in
15 minutes, but that is in a very, very ideal sort of world. But the
GEOSS, that was mentioned, is a good way to coordinate this effort
internationally.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  thank  you  very  much.  And  I  want  to  jump  very
quickly  to  a  different  topic,  because  I  would  like  to  get  two  ques-
tions in.

And one is to follow up on the set of questions earlier from both
the Ranking Member and the Chairman about the appropriate bal-
ance  between  education  and  investments  in  new  technology.  Mr.
Wilson, General Johnson, and Dr. Groat, one of the biggest threats

to our country in terms of tsunami threat is off the shore of Oregon
and  Washington.  The  subduction  fault  is  very  close  at  hand.  And
while  I  completely  agree  with  General  Johnson’s  comment  that  we
should be part of a worldwide integrated system, and that is abso-
lutely crucial, I am concerned that we have an appropriate balance
between education of folks on the west coast so that they can react
to  an  immediate  event  as  opposed  to  giving,  say,  the  Japanese
warning  of  a  10-foot  wave  nine  hours  later,  and,  you  know,  a  50-
foot  wave  coming  up  on  the  Oregon  shores  within  10  minutes  for
parochial  reasons,  if  no  other.  You  know,  I  am  very  concerned
about  that.  Can  you  all  address  the  appropriate  balance  in  our
budget between the investments in buoys and technology and elec-
tronic warning systems and sort of sometimes the harder to defend
and  harder  to  get  dollars,  if  you  will,  for  ‘‘soft  things’’,  like  edu-
cation, which may prove absolutely crucial when you have only got
10 minutes from the event to water coming on shore.

Mr.  WILSON.  I  would  just  like  to  respond  to  that,  Member  Wu,
because since I have been in this position, I have had to deal with
the  concern  for  false  alarms  along  the  coastline,  too.  And  because
we communicate that when people feel localized earthquakes along
the  coast,  like  a  pair  of  earthquakes  that  were  off  shore  this  past
summer  along  the  Oregon  coast,  I  had  people  in  a  small  town  of
Waldport, at 11:00 p.m., when they felt a magnitude 4.5, you know,
running out of their house, because they were afraid that this was
it. And you know, the ability to get an all-clear transmitted to peo-
ple  so  that  they  understand  that  this  was—they  had—they  re-
sponded  correctly,  but  this  isn’t  a  tsunami-producing  earthquake.
That is still a level of technology and a level of confidence that we
need  to  work  on  for  delivery  to  the  people.  It  is  the  opposite  end
of giving them an accurate warning. We also need to be able to give
them an accurate all-clear.

Brigadier General JOHNSON. I appreciate the question because it
allows  me  the  opportunity  to  fix  something.  The  numbers  of  $1.5
million I spoke earlier were specifically for just the Pacific side. On
the Atlantic/Caribbean/Gulf side, we have additional dollars, so the
total, Mr. Chairman, is $2.75 million in 2005 and $2.5 million and
then straight-lined through the outyears for education, inundation,
mapping,  modeling  efforts,  and  the  very  important  education  out-
reach.

Mr.  WU.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  if  you  could  indulge  me  one  last

question. I think it is———

guished colleague.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  would  be  pleased  to  indulge  my  distin-

Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
This  is  of  great  importance  to,  I  think,  everybody  on  the  West
Coast,  and  I  take  a  great  interest  in  it  as  I  spend  a  lot  of  time  in
the  coastal  parts  of  my  Congressional  District.  I  was  watching—I
was  looking  at  those  inundation  maps.  And  if  I  am  just  driving
along Highway 101 and something big happens, how high do I have
to get, how high do my constituents have to get, how far inland do
they have to get? That is something I have never quite known.

Mr.  WILSON.  Well,  that  certain  level  of  responsiveness  is  dif-
ferent  in  nearly  every  locality  there  based  on  the  off  shore  topog-
raphy, the local topography, the directionality. It really emphasizes

why  the  site-specific  modeling  has  to  be  done.  We  can’t  just  go
down the coast and draw a line at a 50-foot contour with any accu-
racy  that—as  we  have  seen  and  we  are  just  learning,  there  were
areas  in  there  that  exceeded  that.  So  we  are  still  trying  to  make
our  evacuation  mapping  as  accurate  as  possible  for  people.  We
would  hate  to  tell  people  they  only  have  to  go  to  50  feet  when,  in
fact, it may be worse than that.

Mr. WU. More research to be done?
Mr. WILSON. More research.
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  And  additionally,  you  don’t  get  one
wave. You get multiple successive waves. So—and this is at a time
where  communication  infrastructure  may  be  damaged,  so  this
awareness issue that the emergency managers bring to the end-to-
end  system  is  crucial,  because  you  need  to  know  when  you  can  go
back, because as we saw in this event, sir, there was about an hour
of  spacing  in  between  and  five  huge  waves—and  is  that  the  last
one? How do you know?

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. McCaul.
Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  MCCAUL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you,  distin-
guished  panelists.  I  had  a  question  about  the—for  Dr.  Groat  and
General  Johnson  with  respect  to  the  $37  million  the  Administra-
tion has proposed. Can you, in a very general sense, tell me where
that  money  is  allocated  with  respect  to  the  warning  detection  sys-
tem,  both  to  protect  the  United  States  but  also  in  a  global  sense?
We talked a lot about GEOSS. Is any of that money going towards
a global warning system?

Dr.  GROAT.  From  the  seismic  aspect  of  this,  a  small  amount  is
going  to  the  global  perspective  in  that  we  intend  to  bring  from  80
percent to 100 percent the real-time transmission of earthquake in-
formation  from  the  global  network.  The—and  also  the  money  that
is  being  put  towards  upgrading  our  National  Earthquake  Informa-
tion  Center  to  bring  modern  hardware  and  software  there  to  en-
hance  the  processing  of  both  global  and  domestic  seismic  informa-
tion will have the dual benefit of helping the United States in both
earthquakes  and  tsunami  concerns,  but  also  that  information
would be available, on a global sense, shared with others. So it has
that dual role. And as far as the maintenance support for that sys-
tem  as  well  as  for  the  global  seismic  network,  particularly  includ-
ing the Caribbean, that again has some global aspects, but it bene-
fits  chiefly  the  United  States  and  its  interests.  So  our  focus  is  on
the  United  States,  but  in  upgrading  the  Global  Seismic  Network’s
real-time  capability  and  the  processing  of  data  from  that,  it  will
have some global impacts that are positive as well.

Mr. MCCAUL. Okay.
Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  I  view  this  as  a  two-tier  approach.
One is taking care of national concerns and then the other is appli-
cability into sharing into the larger Global Earth Observation Sys-
tem  of  Systems  where  100  percent  of  it  goes  towards  protecting
U.S. Coasts.

Mr. MCCAUL. Okay.
Brigadier General JOHNSON. It allows you to characterize the ex-
tent  of  the  wave,  the  height  of  the  wave,  the  propagation  of  the
wave  as  it  transfers  up  the  coast,  up  towards  the  Aleutians,  if  it

were  to  happen  at  the  Cascadia  and  elsewhere  into  Hawaii,  into
American—you know, into our obligations. And because we need to
defend  America’s—or  be  able  to  detect  it  on  all  of  our  coastlines,
it  allows  us—as  a  byproduct,  but  it  allows  us  to  share  that  data,
as  Dr.  Groat  says,  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  and  we  benefit  from
them.  The  tsunami  that  happened  off  of  Sumatra,  26  hours  later,
gave us a 20-centimeter rise in San Diego 26 hours later. So there
is  benefit  in  sharing  information.  Now  that  is  not  of  big  con-
sequence,  at  this  point,  but  depending  on  where  that  happens,  it
is valuable to have data shared from around the world, sir.

Mr. MCCAUL. And my second question is what is the time frame
for implementation? And will this be tied to a more comprehensive
information system as a whole?

Dr.  GROAT.  Our  pledge  for  implementation  are—in  current  year,
with supplemental funds, to do that upgrading to 24/7 to the hard-
ware/software upgrade and to maintain it without your funds. So—
and  I  think,  as  General  Johnson  pointed  out,  they  had  2007  plan
for their system implementation. So it is sooner than later.

Brigadier General JOHNSON. Yes, sir. 2005 and 2006, I am view-
ing  to  have  mid-2007  as  the  implementation  for  the  entire  buoy
and sea tide gauge program.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  And  will  that  be  tied  to  a  comprehensive  informa-

tion system?

Brigadier General JOHNSON. It will be linked in through the Cen-
ters, through the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, and the backup
in  Alaska  that  are  mutually  redundant  and  then  that  information
is shared out through the information grids to all of member coun-
tries to America, and then we will share that data through GEOSS
to the rest of the world.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  And  lastly,  for  Dr.  Lerner-Lam,  now  I  come  from
a  Gulf  Coast  State,  the  State  of  Texas.  My  constituents  will  want
to know, you know, are we at any sort of risk, either that the Gulf
Coast States or the Caribbean States, if you could maybe just high-
light what risk there is, if any, of this type of disaster.

Dr. LERNER-LAM. Well, you have a multiple-hazard risk. There is
the potential for the sorts of large earthquakes, based on work that
the U.S. Geological Survey has done, in the Caribbean. So certainly
the Caribbean States have some history, both in the geologic record
and  the  historical  record  of  having  tsunami  risk.  There  is  not  that
history  in  the  Gulf  Coast,  however,  of  course,  you  have  a  meteoro-
logical hazard in the Gulf Coast. So one thing to emphasize is that
by  linking,  in  some  sense,  the  hurricane  preparedness  efforts  as
well as the tsunami preparedness efforts, there may be some econo-
mies to scale on that point. So in the rare instance that an extreme
event  happens  or  a  landslide  off  the  coast  happens,  you  could  be
prepared.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  So  in  other  words,  a  warning  detection  system

would help with respect to other disasters that could occur?

Dr. LERNER-LAM. As well, yes.
Mr. MCCAUL. Okay. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
And here is the deal. We have got a series of votes on the Floor,
and  we  are  not  going  to  be  presumptuous  enough  to  say  well,  you
can  hang  around  for  an  hour  while  we  go  over  there  and  play

Congresspeople,  so  after  Ms.  Jackson  Lee  has  her  one  minute,  we
are  going  to  adjourn.  And  thank  you  all  very  much  for  serving  as
resources.  We  will  submit  some  questions  in  writing  to  you,  be-
cause  we  would  like  some  of  your  opinions.  And  General  Johnson,
you may be interested in an aside, because both the Ranking Mem-
ber and I said, when you said you have got a five-minute response
capability.  How  can  you  get  there  in  five  minutes?  And  Counsel
pointed  out  that  you  have  got  housing  right  on—adjacent  to  the
Center, so———

Brigadier  General  JOHNSON.  Yeah,  we  have  got  a  flophouse  that

we make the guys stay in, sir.

Mr. WU. And Mr. Chairman, if—I would ask for unanimous con-

sent that opening statements be inserted in the record.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Without objection, so ordered.
And Ms. Jackson Lee, for the final word.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for
your  kindness.  And  this  is  an  important  hearing.  I  have  just  come
back from the region, and I know many of you, or some of you, may
have  had,  I  would  call  it  tragic,  opportunity  to  see  the  enormous
devastation  and  loss.  Just  for  the  record,  the  last  tsunami  with
deaths  over  60,000—over  10,000  was  in  1755  where  there  were
60,000  people  that  lost  their  lives.  I  would  simply  say,  Mr.  Chair-
man,  that  this  tragedy  cries  out  for  action  by  the  Science  Com-
mittee.  I  think  we  could  have  done  better,  and  I  say  this  because
in talking to some officials, there was a reach to the United States.
And  my  understanding  was,  because  there  were  no  buoys  present,
that  you  couldn’t  detect  it  and  therefore  give  notice  or  work.  So  I
think we can do better.

I  would  also  offer  to  say  to  you  that  NASA’s  JASON  I  was  able
to  detect  some  of  the  tsunami  signals,  if  you  will,  but  there  is  no
system in place to sort of nexus or connect. I think that we can do
better  by  involving  NASA.  It  seems  they  are  somewhat  out  of  the
way,  if  you  will,  but  that  is  because  we  have  new  technology  that
you  can  coordinate.  So  I  would  simply  ask  that  we  have  an  oppor-
tunity  for  engagement,  and  if  the  General  can  answer  or  just  say
can we, General Johnson, look to new technologies and begin to col-
laborate  with  other  agencies,  because  I,  too,  come  from  the  coastal
region?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
And  General,  we  have  to  go,  because  we  have  to  make  the  vote,
and  we  would  appreciate  if  you  would  respond  in  writing.  And  let
me say to my distinguished colleague from Texas, that is the whole
reason why we are here. We are determined to do better. They are.
We are. That is what we do best. But I will tell you this, also, that
while  it  is  in  our  enlightened  self  interest  to  provide  leadership  to
the world, I am a little bit concerned that others aren’t as actively
engaged  as  we  are  and,  you  know,  it  is  not  just  our  treasury  and
our  technology,  although  we  have  got  to  employ  everything  pos-
sible,  we  have  got  to  get  some  of  the  others.  So  Mr.  Wilson,  the
Kobe  conference,  got  to  follow  through  on.  Japan  has  got  to  be
starting to share some information with us. Australia, a lot of other
nations  involved.  We  are  all  in  this  together,  and  let  us  do  it  to-
gether.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Charles  ‘‘Chip’’  G.  Groat,  Director,  United  States  Geological  Survey,

U.S. Department of the Interior

Q1. Did  the  Administration  conduct  any  formal  or  informal  outside  evaluations  of
its new proposal, including tsunami detection (DART) buoy placement, assessing
other  technologies,  or  talking  with  states  and  localities  about  their  major  con-
cerns? If so, please provide specifics of the evaluation. If not, why not?

A1. The  President  has  proposed  that  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  upgrade
the  USGS  National  Earthquake  Information  Center  (NEIC)  and  the  Global  Seis-
mographic Network (GSN), improve distribution of earthquake data, and undertake
coastal mapping for tsunami hazard assessment.

The  NEIC  upgrade  and  establishment  of  24/7  operations  are  longstanding  prior-
ities  for  the  Advanced  National  Seismic  System  (ANSS),  which  was  authorized  as
part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) in 2000 and
reauthorized  in  2004.  These  plans  are  laid  out  in  USGS  Circular  1188,  which  was
developed  in  consultation  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  stakeholders  and  partners  in
government, academia and the private sector. The ANSS is overseen by an external
steering committee that reports to the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Com-
mittee.

In  the  weeks  following  the  earthquake  and  tsunami,  USGS  consulted  with  our
partners  in  the  Global  Seismographic  Network  about  priority  needs  and  the  best
means to address those needs. We also drew on existing reports, for example a 1999
USGS-sponsored workshop on ‘‘Seismic and Tsunami Hazard in Puerto Rico and the
Virgin  Islands’’  attended  by  international  academic,  local  academic  and  govern-
mental,  and  federal  agency  experts  on  seismic  and  tsunami  hazard  research,  engi-
neering,  and  mitigation  (complete  workshop  proceedings  are  available  at  http://
pubs.usgs.gov/of/of99-353/tsunamigrp.html)  as  well  as  a  2001  proposal  for  an  Intra-
Americas  Sea  Tsunami  Warning  System  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Sci-
entific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic
Commission. USGS scientists were already engaged in extensive discussion of coast-
al  mapping  priorities  with  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
(NOAA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), discussions that con-
tinued with colleagues in academia and government in recent weeks.
Q2. Do  you  agree  with  the  following  recommendations  made  by  the  hearing  wit-

nesses to improve the Administration’s Tsunami Plan?
• More  attention  should  be  paid  to  education,  especially  for  tsunamis  that  are
either  generated  close  to  shore  or  are  generated  by  events  that  cannot  be  felt.
A. The  USGS  agrees  that  public  awareness  is  a  critical  component  in  any  warning
system,  whether  for  tsunamis  or  other  natural  disasters.  Education  is  a  key  focus
of the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP), which is a partner-
ship  among  NOAA,  USGS,  FEMA,  NSF,  and  the  five  states  bordering  the  Pacific
Ocean.

• Hazard mapping efforts should be expanded.

A. The President’s proposal calls on USGS to undertake additional coastal mapping
for  tsunami  hazard  assessment.  That  is  in  addition  to  work  already  being  done  by
NTHMP,  which  is  coordinating  the  preparation  of  tsunami  inundation  maps  for
high-risk  coastal  communities  in  Alaska,  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon,  and  Wash-
ington.  The  USGS  provides  valuable  guidance  in  the  preparation  of  these  maps  by:
(1)  developing  high  resolution  coastal  bathymetry  and  topography;  (2)  finding,  ana-
lyzing  and  interpreting  deposits  from  historic  and  prehistoric  tsunamis  to  estimate
tsunami  inundation  limits,  flow  velocities,  and  recurrence  intervals;  and,  (3)  devel-
oping hydrodynamic models and simulations of tsunami impacts.

• More money should be allocated to local warning systems and research to im-

prove them.

A. The  USGS  provides  principal  funding  for  regional  seismic  networks  in  the
United  States.  In  coastal  areas  with  significant  risk  from  locally  generated
tsunamis,  such  as  the  Pacific  Northwest  and  Alaska,  these  networks  receive  addi-
tional  support  from  NOAA  through  NTHMP.  The  USGS  supports  the  President’s
proposal, which adopts a broad approach to improving tsunami warning systems.

maintenance cost of the buoys.

oping better buoys.

• Redundant buoys should be purchased and funds should be allocated to devel-
• More  work  should  be  done  on  tsunami  probabilities  to  better  site  the  buoys.
• The  buoys  should  be  equipped  with  more  instruments  to  be  better  integrated

into NOAA and NSF research programs.

A. Because  these  recommendations  specifically  address  NOAA  systems,  USGS  will
leave the response to this recommendation to NOAA.

• Tsunami  efforts  should  be  incorporated  into  the  development  of  a  broader

multi-hazard warning system.

A. The USGS supports the President’s proposal that a global tsunami warning sys-
tem  should  be  developed  in  the  context  of  the  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of
Systems (GEOSS) and it should be developed in a multi-hazard context to the fullest
extent  possible.  For  earthquakes,  volcanoes  and  landslides,  the  USGS  has  the  lead
federal  responsibility  under  the  Disaster  Relief  Act  (P.L.  93–288,  popularly  known
as  the  Stafford  Act),  to  enhance  public  safety  and  reduce  losses  through  effective
forecasts  and  warnings  based  on  the  best  possible  scientific  information.  For  tsu-
nami,  the  USGS  provides  real-time  seismic  data  from  global  and  regional  seismic
networks  to  NOAA,  which  has  the  responsibility  to  issue  warnings  through  its  Na-
tional  Weather  Service  (NWS).  While  NWS  has  the  statutory  responsibility  for
issuing  flood  watches  and  warnings,  USGS  provides  real-time  stream  flow  informa-
tion  to  the  NWS  in  support  of  those  activities.  The  NWS  also  has  responsibility  for
forecasts  and  warnings  associated  with  landfall  of  hurricanes  and  other  coastal
storms.  The  USGS  provides  information  related  to  the  vulnerability  of  coastal  re-
sources  and  communities  to  resulting  coastal  change  hazards.  In  the  case  of
wildfires, USGS partners with a number of federal agency partners to monitor sea-
sonal  fire  danger  condition  and  provide  firefighters  with  maps  of  current  fire  loca-
tions, perimeters, and potential spread.

Effective  warnings  allow  people  to  take  actions  that  save  lives,  protect  property,
reduce business disruption, and speed recovery. In addition, prompt alerting of what
is  happening  during  and  immediately  following  a  natural  disaster  is  also  critical.
Regardless  of  the  type  of  hazard,  effective  warnings  require  more  than  the  tech-
nology to inform the public of the hazard. Their success depends on having response
plans  in  place  and  pre-event  linkages  established  among  Federal,  State,  and  local
government  agencies,  nongovernmental  organizations,  the  private  sector,  and  the
media.  It  is  essential  that  hazard  warnings  be  both  accurate  and  accurately  tar-
geted. Accordingly, USGS strives to obtain the best scientific understanding of haz-
ardous phenomena, while also working closely with a wide range of partners to en-
sure  that  pre-event  linkages  are  in  place  so  that  warnings  of  impending  natural
events  and  assessment  of  their  impact  get  to  the  affected  communities  as  rapidly
as possible.

For all natural hazards, effective warning requires an integrated system involving
information gathering, expert evaluation, generation of accurate warnings, and com-
munication to an educated and informed audience that is prepared to take effective
action.  Although  the  specific  technologies  for  detecting  earthquakes  and  tsunamis
is largely unique to those hazards, the communication of the warnings derived from
those systems take advantage of all-hazard capabilities.

• The  Global  Seismic  Network  should  be  expanded  and  should  include  new

kinds of equipment.

A. The  USGS  agrees  with  the  need  to  expand  and  improve  GSN,  and  the  Presi-
dent’s  proposal  provides  additional  funds  to  do  just  that.  The  USGS  supports  the
incorporation of GSN into the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS).
The GSN is a multi-use network that supports earthquake monitoring, seismological
research, and nuclear test detection. The network’s equipment reflects those diverse
missions.  The  USGS  expects  NSF  to  take  the  lead  in  supporting  the  development
of new seismic sensor technologies.

• NSF  funding  should  be  provided  to  properly  fund  the  operation  and  mod-

ernization of the Global Seismic Network.

A. Inasmuch  as  this  refers  to  funding  by  NSF,  we  will  defer  to  NSF  on  this  ques-
tion.

• The Advanced National Seismic System should be expanded.

A. The  USGS  considers  ANSS  to  be  a  top  priority,  and  the  President’s  proposal  to
upgrade  NEIC  is  a  key  component  in  the  plans  for  ANSS.  Under  present  funding,
USGS  is  expanding  the  number  of  ANSS  stations  nationwide,  including  strong-mo-

tion  sensors  in  the  ground  and  in  buildings  in  high-hazard  urban  areas.  As  addi-
tional  resources  become  available,  USGS  will  expand  these  efforts  to  additional
high-hazard  urban  areas  with  an  ultimate  goal  of  26  having  sufficient  station  den-
sity  to  release  robust  shaking  intensity  maps  and  other  products  within  minutes  of
an  earthquake,  providing  emergency  responders  with  the  information  they  need
when they need it.
Q3. What  are  the  biggest  gaps  in  our  scientific  understanding  of  tsunamis?  How

should the Administration address these gaps?

A3. Scientists  from  USGS  are  currently  working  on  all  three  major  aspects  of  tsu-
nami  research:  generation,  propagation  and  inundation.  Of  those  three,  generation
and inundation have the most significant gaps in understanding.

Accurately characterizing an earthquake as a tsunami generator means getting an
accurate  depth,  slip  distribution,  rupture  extent,  and  other  parameters.  The  Suma-
tra megaquake taught us that this is a challenging task in the time frame of inter-
est  for  tsunami  warning  systems.  We  need  to  get  the  most  out  of  the  seismic  data
in  order  to  determine  whether  unique  aspects  of  tsunami-generating  earthquakes
can  be  distinguished,  providing  information  that  can  augment  the  deep-sea  buoys
and  tide  gauges  in  tsunami-detection  systems.  In  particular,  we  need  to  develop
seismic  discriminants  to  quickly  identify  ‘‘tsunami  earthquakes,’’  anomalous  earth-
quake  that  result  in  larger  than  expected  tsunamis  relative  to  earthquake  mag-
nitude.

Although  earthquakes  cause  most  tsunamis,  underwater  landslides  triggered  by
seismic or volcanic activity can produce locally devastating tsunamis. Greater under-
standing is needed on how landslides generate tsunamis with the goal of predicting
whether  a  given  slope  will  cause  a  landslide  based  on  its  geotechnical  properties.
Another  challenge  is  better  characterization  of  the  size-frequency  of  landslides  in
different regions. In light of the concern about the potential for large tsunamis gen-
erated  by  volcanic  collapse  (for  example  in  the  Canary  Islands  or  the  south  flank
of  Hawaii’s  Big  Island),  we  need  a  means  to  verify  that  huge  tsunami  waves  can
be  generated  in  the  open  ocean  from  measurements  of  the  landslide  source  itself.
A  key  uncertainty  in  preparing  inundation  maps  is  the  probability  of  occurrence
from  a  given  source.  Our  ability  to  forecast  impacts  depends  on  improvements  in
modeling  that  draw  on  a  robust  database  of  high-quality,  comprehensive  field  data
and  synthesis  from  a  larger  number  of  tsunamis  with  different  sources  (e.g.,  land-
slides, faults) in different settings (e.g., open ocean, fjords) to provide the basis and
constraints for the models.

Field  observations,  eyewitness  reports  and  video  footage  from  the  Indian  Ocean
and  other  recent  tsunamis  have  shown  us  that  tsunami  inundation  is  not  well  un-
derstood. A key gap in our scientific understanding of tsunamis is in how they lose
energy  once  they  hit  the  shoreline  until  they  reach  the  limit  of  inundation.  Such
knowledge  is  needed  to  predict  how  far  inland  a  tsunami  will  be  destructive  and
deadly,  and  such  predictions  are  needed  to  accurately  determine  zones  of  high  tsu-
nami risk that can be used to develop viable plans to minimize loss of life and prop-
erty.

Key  steps  to  improve  our  understanding  of  inundation  and  better  assist  emer-
gency managers, coastal zone planners, and the public include: (1) better near-shore
bathymetry in areas known to have tsunami risk; (2) more complex non-linear inun-
dation  models;  and,  (3)  additional  field  studies  of  recent  and  ancient  tsunamis  to
compare  with  inundation  models.  For  the  U.S.,  these  efforts  should  be  directed  to-
ward  the  Pacific  Northwest,  Caribbean,  Alaska,  Hawaii,  Guam,  and  other  U.S.
Trust  Territories  and  Possessions.  Regional  gaps  in  understanding  include:  deter-
mining  the  size  of  the  largest  tsunamis  in  the  past  several  thousand  years  to  hit
each of these areas; the size of tsunamis generated by the Cascadia Subduction Zone
off the Pacific Northwest every 300–900 years and the impacts of such an event on
central  and  southern  California;  and  whether  the  Atlantic  Coast  has  ever  been  hit
by a large tsunami.

A1. The  Global  Seismographic  Network  (GSN)  is  considered  to  be  a  Capital  Asset
of  the  Federal  Government.  Within  the  framework  of  OMB  Circular  A–11,  Section
7,  the  GSN  has  been  evaluated  by  USGS  to  be  a  non-major  IT  investment  in  an

107

operational/steady  state.  Such  an  investment  does  not  require  a  formal  Capital
Asset Plan (OMB Exhibit 300). Nevertheless, USGS employs the disciplines of good
project  management  for  GSN,  and  monitors  all  aspects  of  the  performance  of  the
investment.

With regard to your specific question, USGS has made (and regularly updates) es-
timates of annual and long-term operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, both for
that  portion  of  GSN  we  operate  and  for  the  network  as  a  whole.  The  most  recent
comprehensive review of GSN O&M costs was in 2002. The review committee found
that to maintain a 90 percent level of data availability will require $82,000 per sta-
tion  per  year.  This  includes  funding  for  labor,  travel,  spare  parts  and  amortization
of equipment. In recent years, inflation costs have been offset by reduced telemetry
costs and improved efficiency in station maintenance; this situation is reviewed an-
nually.
Q2. In  response  to  my  question. . .  What  is  the  additional  annual  operation  and
maintenance  cost  required  to  solve  the  network’s  delayed  maintenance  problems
and maintain the GSN network in good operating condition.

A2. In  the  President’s  FY  2006  Budget,  an  increase  in  funding  for  GSN  operations
and maintenance is requested in the amount of $600,000. This amount would be ap-
plied  to  improve  data  delivery  and  station  reliability  for  the  USGS-operated  GSN
stations  (currently  two-thirds  of  network  stations).  With  this  proposed  increase,
USGS  expects  to  be  able  to  increase  both  the  GSN  stations  with  telemetry  and  the
data availability for those stations we operate.

The  proposed  funding  increase  does  not  address  delayed  station  maintenance
problems.  Some  of  the  electronic  components  of  GSN  have  reached  their  amortized
life  expectancy.  In  particular,  power  and  digital  data  logger  systems  now  need  to
be  recapitalized.  To  take  advantage  of  newer  technology  and  to  streamline  mainte-
nance,  GSN  program  mangers  seek  to  replace  all  GSN  data  loggers  over  the  next
few  years.  We  estimate  the  cost  of  addressing  deferred  maintenance  and  recapital-
ization  of  system  at  an  average  of  $13,333  per  station  per  year,  or  $1,747,000  per
year for the full network (USGS+NSF).

The administration expects partner contributions toward the operation and main-
tenance of GSN stations abroad, and indeed many countries and institutions already
provide  direct  and/or  in-kind  support  for  such  stations.  Our  success  in  establishing
and maintaining these contributions is evident in the relatively low cost-per-station
average for the current network.
Q3. I understand the current seismic monitors are no longer manufactured. . . What
plans  are  underway  to  acquire  replacement  seismometers?  Has  USGS  or  NSF
identified  a  potential  manufacturer  for  these  seismometers?  What  is  the  esti-
mated  cost  to  replace  the  existing  network  and  over  what  time  frame  will  this
replacement need to take place?

A3. One of several types of GSN-standard seismometers is no longer manufactured,
the Strekheisen STS–1, a very-broad-band seismometer used to accurately measure
the  sizes  of  the  largest  earthquakes  and  to  collect  accurate  data  on  other  geo-
physical phenomena. In the short term, USGS anticipates that a modification of the
mode  of  emplacement  of  another  Strekheisen  seismometer,  the  STS–2  (still-manu-
factured),  may  serve  as  an  interim  replacement  for  the  STS–1.  We  are,  therefore,
not seeking a new manufacturer at this time, but recognize the need for its replace-
ment in the near future. The USGS expects NSF to take the lead in supporting the
development of new seismic sensor technologies.

The  USGS  has  set  no  timeline  for  replacing  GSN  seismometers,  as  they  appear
to  have  very  long  lives  if  properly  installed  and  adequately  maintained.  This  ques-
tion  is  reviewed  semi-annually  by  the  GSN  Standing  Committee.  Amortization  of
GSN  equipment  is  included  in  the  per-station  operation  and  maintenance  figures
previously mentioned.
Q4. The President’s plan is silent on the role of [NSF]. . . What role will NSF play

in the planning and deployment of this expanded tsunami warning system?

A4. From  a  USGS  perspective,  our  full  partnership  with  NSF  in  the  implementa-
tion,  expansion  and  maintenance  of  the  GSN  will  ensure  NSF’s  engagement  in  the
planning  and  deployment  of  the  expanded  tsunami  warning  system.  For  example,
we have worked with NSF through its implementing agent for GSN, the IRIS Con-
sortium,  in  developing  the  currently  proposed  GSN  enhancement.  Coordination  of
the  implementation  of  the  upgrades  will  be  done  through  the  GSN  Standing  Com-
mittee, which reports to NSF through IRIS.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Brigadier General David L. Johnson (Ret.), Director, National Oceanic

and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service

Q1. Did the Administration conduct any formal or informal outside evaluation of its
new  proposal,  including  tsunami  detection  (DART)  buoy  placement,  assessing
other  technologies,  or  talking  with  states  and  localities  about  their  major  con-
cerns? If so, please provide specifics of the evaluation. If not, why not?

A1. The  structure  and  contents  of  the  Administration’s  tsunami  proposal  is  based
on the existing National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP), which has
been developed through years of working closely with our State partners and exter-
nal  experts.  The  Administration’s  plan  was  developed,  in  response  to  the  Indian
Ocean  Tsunami,  in  order  to  expand  coverage  of  the  United  States.  This  plan  rep-
resents an accelerated version of our current efforts in the NTHMP.

NOAA  has  given  careful  thought  to  the  placement  of  DART  stations  in  order  to
establish  a  complete  DART  network  that  will  provide  high-quality  tsunami  data  to
the NOAA tsunami warning centers for accurate tsunami forecasting. Careful siting
of each DART station within the network is required to cover all potential tsunami
source  zones  that  could  impact  the  United  States.  Tsunamis  can  be  highly  direc-
tional,  with  a  relatively  narrow  beam  of  focused  energy  that  could  propagate  unde-
tected  through  the  network,  if  tsunameters  are  too  widely  spaced.  Spacing  of  ap-
proximately  1000  km  between  each  DART  station  is  required  to  reliably  assess  the
main energy beam of a tsunami generated by a magnitude 8 earthquake.

While  other  technologies  (e.g.,  GPS  water  level,  and  satellite  altimetry  and  syn-
thetic  aperture  radar)  may  provide  future  promise,  bottom  pressure  recorder  capa-
bilities  are  the  most  accurate  instruments  available  at  this  time.  Discussions  with
states and localities occur within the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.
Q2. Recommendations to improve the Administration’s Tsunami Plan:

The following is a list of recommendations made by the witnesses to improve the
Administration’s plan. It would be helpful to have comments on each of the rec-
ommendations.
Do you agree with the recommendation that:
• More  attention  should  be  paid  to  education,  especially  for  tsunamis  that  are
either  generated  close  to  shore  or  are  generated  by  events  that  cannot  be  felt.
A. The  Administration’s  plan  includes  $2.5M  over  two  years  for  education  and  out-
reach. Part of this funding will support the TsunamiReady Program, which requires
active  participation  by  the  community  to  educate  the  public  to  recognize  hazardous
conditions and take actions to keep them safe. Part of the education process requires
identifying high-risk areas for determining where to focus education efforts.

• Hazard mapping efforts should be expanded.

A. NOAA’s  activities  are  on  target  to  meet  this  recommendation.  Our  current  plan
is to complete inundation mapping for all at risk U.S. communities by 2015.

• More money should be allocated to local warning systems and research to im-

prove them.

A. It  is  important  to  improve  local  warning  systems  to  protect  U.S.  communities.
However,  tsunami  warnings  are  just  one  of  many  natural  hazards  and  disasters
which  can  impact  our  nation.  Any  comprehensive  warning  system  must  address  all
hazards.  NOAA  will  continue  working  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security
(in  particular,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA) )  in  the  federal
effort to develop a comprehensive national warning ‘‘system of systems.’’

• There  should  be  a  greater  and  more  explicit  commitment  to  operation  and

maintenance costs of the buoys.

A. The  Administration’s  plan  contains  sufficient  funds  to  operate  and  maintain  the
proposed  DART  station  network.  NOAA  remains  fully  committed  to  operating  and
maintaining our network of DART stations.

• Redundant buoys should be purchased and funds should be allocated to devel-

oping better buoys.

A. We agree these issues are critical and NOAA has accounted for some redundancy
in our plan. The DART stations are being redesigned with some redundant features
built  in  so  they  will  better  withstand  the  harsh  conditions  of  the  northern  Pacific.
NOAA will maintain three redundant in-water buoys in Alaska, where the sea con-

109

ditions  are  particularly  harsh  and  servicing  buoys  can  be  difficult.  As  a  part  of  the
Administrations FY 2006 budget, NOAA will be procuring 10 DART buoys as spares
available for redeployment as necessary.

• More  work  should  be  done  on  tsunami  probabilities  to  better  site  the  buoys.
A. Extensive  research  has  been  done  on  this  topic.  The  DART  stations  will  be  lo-
cated along the major subduction zones, where tsunamigenic earthquakes occur. The
planned network of DART stations covers areas susceptible to tsunamis. Additional
evaluations are underway to better optimize DART station placement.

• The  buoys  should  be  equipped  with  more  instruments  to  be  better  integrated

into NOAA and NSF research programs.

A. NOAA agrees that the DART stations can be useful platforms for other types of
observing instruments. The Administration’s plan includes $1M for research and de-
velopment  of  the  next  generation  of  DART  stations.  NOAA  is  working  to  ensure
these new DART stations will be capable of accommodating multiple environmental
sensors to provide additional environmental data.

• Tsunami  efforts  should  be  incorporated  into  the  development  of  a  broader

multi-hazard warning system.

A. NOAA  agrees  and  will  continue  to  work  with  DHS/FEMA  to  facilitate  such  an
effort.

• The  Global  Seismic  Network  should  be  expanded  and  should  include  new

kinds of equipment.

A. The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  operates  the  U.S.  assets  of  the  Global  Seis-
mic Network (GSN) and is best suited to answer this question. However, the Admin-
istration’s  plan  includes  funding  for  upgraded  seismometers  used  to  improve  tsu-
nami  detection  and  includes  funding  for  improvements  to  the  GSN.  Most  tsunamis
are  triggered  by  seismic  events,  and  improvements  to  the  GSN  are  critical  to  (1)
quickly determine the precise location of the seismic event (2) its precise magnitude
and  (3)  quickly  disseminate  this  information  to  the  National  Earthquake  Informa-
tion Center (NEIC) and the NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers.

• NSF  funding  should  be  provided  to  properly  fund  the  operation  and  mod-

ernization of the Global Seismic Network.

A. The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  operates  the  U.S.  assets  of  the  Global  Seismic  Net-
work  (GSN)  and  is  best  suited  to  answer  this  question.  However,  the  Administra-
tion’s plan includes funding for upgraded seismometers used to improve tsunami de-
tection and improvements to the GSN.

• The Advanced National Seismic System should be expanded.

A. U.S.  Geological  Survey  runs  the  Advances  National  Seismic  System  and  is  best
suited to answer this question. However, the Administration’s plan includes funding
for upgraded seismometers used to improve tsunami detection.
Q3. According  to  the  NOAA,  the  annual  operational  costs  for  38  buoys  (in  the  Ad-
ministration’s  plan)  will  be  about  $20  million  per  year.  Does  that  include  re-
placement  costs,  given  that  according  to  the  NOAA  web  site,  the  average  life
span of a DART buoy is less than two years?

A3. The  Administration’s  plan  proposes  39  buoys,  including  29  DART  stations  in
the  Pacific,  three  in-water  backups  in  Alaska,  and  seven  DART  stations  in  the  At-
lantic and Caribbean. Future operation and maintenance costs for this network will
include replacement costs. The level of funding required beyond FY 2006 will be de-
termined through the budget process.

NOAA is taking steps to lengthen the average life span of the DART stations. The
DART stations are being redesigned to better withstand the harsh conditions in the
Pacific Ocean. Some redundant capabilities built in to the new stations will increase
the life span, as will routine maintenance of those stations.
Q4. How  does  NOAA  prioritize  what  types  of  activities  are  funded  through  the  Tsu-
nami Hazard Mitigation Program, such as inundation mapping and education?
How will the additional $5 million proposed for the program in the Administra-
tion’s plan be used?

A4. The  Administration’s  plan  includes  $4.75M  that  will  be  spent  on  inundation
mapping  and  modeling,  as  well  as  education  and  outreach  (e.g.,  community  pre-
paredness  activities  including  TsunamiReady).  Of  this  $4.75M,  approximately

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:17 Jun 20, 2005 Jkt 098395 PO 00000 Frm 00113 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\012605\98395 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

110

$2.25M  will  be  spent  on  inundation  mapping  and  modeling  and  $2.5M  will  go  to-
wards public education activities.

The  objectives  of  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  (NTHMP)
were  established  in  the  NTHMP  Implementation  Plan  in  1996.  This  plan  can  be
found  at:  http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami-hazard/hazard3.pdf.  NTHMP  funding
decisions are made by the NTHMP Steering Committee, which includes membership
from each participating state (Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and California),
NOAA, Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Geological Survey. Funds
are  allocated  to  proposals  submitted  by  the  states,  federal  agencies  (including
NOAA), and others, by vote of the Steering Committee. Funding decisions are based
upon the three NTHMP priorities: Hazard Assessment, Hazard Prediction, and Haz-
ard  Mitigation.  The  NTHMP  Steering  Committee  reviews  these  priorities  annually.
The Administration’s Plan accelerates all three of these priorities and expands them
to include all U.S. communities at risk.
Q5. The Administration’s plan is to add DART buoys to the Atlantic and Caribbean.
Would either the current Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii or the cen-
ter in Alaska be able to monitor and forecast warnings for the Atlantic and Car-
ibbean?

A5. Yes, either of the current NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers will be able to mon-
itor conditions and issue tele-tsunami warnings for the Atlantic and Caribbean. The
key  to  providing  accurate  and  timely  tsunami  warnings  for  the  Atlantic  and  the
Caribbean is to have improved tsunami detection and warning capabilities in place.
The Administration’s plan includes:

• Expanded real-time seismic network for the Caribbean,
• Expanded  Caribbean-Atlantic  DART  systems,  Expanded  sea-level  monitoring

network, and

• 24/7 operation of the USGS/NEIC and the U.S. Tsunami Warning Centers.

Once appropriate sensors are in place, the existing Tsunami Warning Centers will
be  able  to  monitor  conditions  and  issue  tele-tsunami  warnings  for  the  Atlantic  and
the  Caribbean.  We  are  exploring  other  options  to  address  regional  concerns,  such
as international education and outreach efforts, and to address local tsunami warn-
ings.
Q6. What  are  the  biggest  gaps  in  our  scientific  understanding  of  tsunamis?  How

should the Administration address these gaps?

A6. The  tsunami  phenomenon  is  fairly  well  understood  from  a  physics  perspective,
and numerical models are used to describe how shallow water waves are generated
and how they interact with the shore. However, there are some gaps when one con-
siders the entire process, from which earthquakes can cause a tsunami, to knowing
the particular bathymetry of the coast, to how far the waves will reach inland. One
gap  in  our  scientific  understanding  of  the  entire  process  is  the  capability  to  detect
and measure tsunami waves crossing the ocean. Another is the understanding of the
forces  of  tsunamis  as  they  flood  the  coastline.  The  proposed  DART  network  will  go
a  long  way  toward  filling  these  gaps  as  critical  data  from  the  network  increase  our
understanding  of  the  offshore  forcing  mechanisms  of  tsunamis  and  increase  our
open  ocean  detection  capabilities.  This  information,  coupled  with  field  measure-
ments, laboratory experiments, and numerical models of the forces on structures as
the tsunami floods the coastline, will further our understanding, and ultimately pre-
diction  of,  tsunamis.  This  research  effort  should  include  the  coordinated  efforts  of
NSF,  NOAA,  and  National  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Program.  Additional  re-
search  is  also  needed  to  quickly  identify  the  true  size,  rupture  region,  and  slip  dis-
tribution  of  massive  tsunamigenic  earthquakes,  such  as  the  December  26,  2005  In-
dian Ocean event. Similar events occurred in the Pacific four times in the last cen-
tury. Research is also needed to quantify uncertainties in numerical model forecasts
based  on  very  sparse  observational  data.  The  Administration’s  proposal  goes  a  long
way toward addressing these issues.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Circular  No.  A–  11,  Part  7  requires  all  agencies  to  provide  a  capital  asset  plan
for  each  major  new  and  on-going  major  investment,  system,  or  acquisition,  and
operational  asset  they  manage.  As  part  of  the  capital  asset  plan  NOAA  is  re-
quired  to  estimate  life-cycle  costs  of  the  system  with  more  detail  and  specificity
on, costs as a system approaches the operational stage.

A capital asset is defined as structures, equipment, intellectual property and in-
formation technology that are used by the Federal Government and have an esti-
mated useful life of two years or more. Clearly, the combined tsunami buoy and
seismic  networks  required  for  the  tsunami  warning  system  are  capital  assets.
The  proposal  for  expanding  the  network  in  the  Pacific,  deploying  a  network  in
the Atlantic and Caribbean, and maintaining 24/7 staffing at the National Tsu-
nami Warning Center requires a capital asset acquisition and the associated op-
eration and maintenance cost to maintain the system.
I assume NOAA completed the required life-cycle analysis as required under Cir-
cular No. A–11 to develop the budget request for the FY 2005 Supplemental and
as justification for the FY 2006 budget since the proposed upgrades and expan-
sion of the network and the increased staffing represent a change in acquisition,
operation and maintenance of a capital asset.
What  range  of  annual  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  estimated  by
NOAA  for  the  expanded  tsunami  warning  network  included  in  the  President’s
proposal and submitted to OMB?

A1. The  Administration’s  two-year  commitment  to  strengthen  the  U.S.  Tsunami
Warning  Program  contains  funding  to  procure  and  deploy  new  tsunami  detection
systems  and  to  accelerate  hazard  assessment  and  hazard  mitigation  programs.  The
level  of  funding  required  beyond  FY  2006  will  be  determined  through  the  budget
process.
Q2. It  appears  we  have  two  issues  with  respect  to  the  requirements  for  ship  time  to
service  the  buoy  network:  the  first  is  whether  your  budget  contains  sufficient
funds  to  cover  the  cost  of  ship  time  for  servicing.  The  second  is  whether  NOAA
will  have  ship  time  available  even  if  sufficient  funds  are  available  to  cover  its
cost.

Q2a. Will NOAA have sufficient ships and time available on them to cover all of the
current program activities, the expansion of the network in the Pacific, and the
establishment of a network in the Atlantic and Caribbean?

A2a. The  Administration’s  plan  includes  sufficient  funds  for  ship  time,  either  serv-
ice provided by NOAA vessels or through contract ship support, to maintain the pro-
posed DART station network.
Q2b. What  is  the  estimated  ship  time  per  year  required  to  service  the  expanded  Pa-

cific network based upon your experience with the current network?

A2b. Based  on  our  experience  with  the  current  DART  stations,  we  estimate  that
280  days  (230  planned  and  SO  contingency)  worth  of  ship  time  will  be  required  to
service the expanded network of DART stations in the Pacific Basin, given the cur-
rent information on their planned locations.
Q2c. What  is  the  estimated  ship  time  per  year  required  to  service  the  Atlantic  and

Caribbean network?

A2c. We estimate that the seven DART stations deployed in the Atlantic and Carib-
bean will require 58 days (48 planned and 10 contingency) worth of ship time, given
the current information on their planned locations.
Q3. How  much  does  our  research  on  hurricane-related  storm  surges  in  the  Atlantic
and  Caribbean  contribute  to  our  understanding  of  tsunami  hazards  in  those
areas?

A3. NOAA’s  operational  and  research  efforts  for  hurricane-related  storm  surge  in
the  Atlantic  and  Caribbean  has  given  us  a  starting  point  to  understand  and  model
the bathymetry of the near-shore environment that can be used to model tsunamis.
Using  the  bathymetric  results  from  the  storm  surge  program  will  help  with  the  in-
undation  mapping  for  the  East  coast,  Gulf  coast,  and  Caribbean  islands,  but  it  is
just  a  beginning.  The  physical  processes  responsible  for  hurricane  surges  and
tsunamis are vastly different. Tsunamis are a series of waves, or surges, sometimes
many hours apart, rather than one storm surge driven by strong winds from a hur-
ricane.
Q4. Tsunami  hazard  potential  is  directly  affected  by  the  topography  of  the  seafloor
between  an  earthquake’s  epicenter  and  a  particular  coastline.  How  adequate  is
our knowledge of the bathymetry along the U.S. coastlines? How does the avail-
ability of this information affect the accuracy of inundation maps?

A4. With  the  exception  of  a  few  coastal  communities  in  Alaska,  existing  U.S.  ba-
thymetry  data  and  information  are  adequate  for  tsunami  modeling  to  produce  tsu-
nami inundation maps.
Q5. The  Administration’s  proposal  indicates  you  will  be  expanding  the  Tsunami
Ready  communities  program.  Considering  that  much  of  the  funding  for  achiev-
ing Tsunami Ready status comes from State and local budgets, how does NOAA
plan  to  increase  the  number  of  Tsunami  Ready  communities  along  the  coasts?
A5. NOAA  is  committed  to  accelerating  and  expanding  its  TsunamiReady  commu-
nity  program  to  all  at-risk  communities,  and  expects  to  have  at  least  40  additional
TsunamiReady  communities  by  the  end  of  FY  2006.  The  Administration’s  plan  pro-
vides  $2.5M  to  NOAA  over  two  years  to  support  public  education  activities,  includ-
ing  community  preparedness  activities  such  as  the  TsunamiReady  Program.  While
NOAA  recognizes  that  achieving  TsunamiReady  status  requires  significant  State
and  local  support,  NOAA  will  continue  working  with  local  communities  to  leverage
existing  assets  and  community  warning  preparedness  programs,  which  provide  the
foundation for allowing a community to become ‘‘TsunamiReady.’’
Q6. Mr.  Wilson  indicated  he  participates  in  a  multi-state  and  multi-federal  agency
group  through  the  National  Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program.  Does  NOAA
intend  to  establish  similar  multi-state  groups  for  the  Atlantic  states  to  promote
the  development  of  tsunami  evacuation  plans  and  public  education  programs?
Will  a  similar  approach  be  taken  for  U.S.  territories?  When  do  you  anticipate
establishing these working groups?

A6. NOAA  would  like  to  expand  the  NTHMP  to  include  all  U.S.  States  and  Terri-
tories  with  communities  at  risk  from  a  tsunami,  but  the  current  structure  of  the
program would have to be modified. Under the current structure, NTHMP funds are
distributed  to  the  states  and  federal  agencies  by  the  vote  of  the  NTHMP  Steering
Committee.  Adding  15  states,  three  territories,  and  two  commonwealths  to  the  cur-
rent  Steering  Committee  expands  the  scope  of  the  program  and  requires  us  to  con-
sider a new governance structure.
Q7. What is the status of inundation mapping for the west coast of the U.S.? Is most
of the mapping completed? What about the Atlantic coast and the Caribbean ter-
ritories? How often do these maps need to be revised?

A7. Based  on  input  from  Alaska,  California,  Hawaii,  Oregon  and  Washington,  21
of  167  planned  mapping  efforts  have  been  completed.  About  15  percent  of  the  west
coast inundation mapping, covering 30 percent of the population at risk, is complete.
On  the  east  coast  and  the  Caribbean,  only  Puerto  Rico  has  tsunami  inundation
maps,  which  were  funded  by  Sea  Grant  and  the  government  of  Puerto  Rico.  Revi-
sions  to  these  inundation  maps  are  required  only  when  a  major  change  (more  than
10 percent) in near shore bathymetry or coastal topography has occurred.
Q8. The  DART  system  (Deep  Ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  buoys)
combined  with  the  Bottom  Pressure  Recorders  (BPR),  installed  by  NOAA  in  the
Pacific Ocean was effective in canceling an evacuation in Hawaii following a 7.5
magnitude Alaskan earthquake in November 2003 that could have, but did not,
cause  a  tsunami.  This  helped  to  save  tens  of  millions  of  dollars,  not  to  mention
the potential for personal injury or property damage associated with an unneces-
sary  evacuation.  If  installed  in  the  Indian  Ocean  and  combined  with  appro-
priate  warning  and  evacuation  protocols,  I  can  imagine  that  many  lives  might
have  been  saved  in  Sri  Lanka  and  in  Thailand.  There  is  also  considerable  dis-
cussion  about  expanding  the  DART  system  to  the  Atlantic  and  within  the  Pa-
cific. Earlier this month, Admiral Lautenbacher (Administrator of National Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration)  indicated  that  three  of  the  six  DART
buoys are not functioning. He also classified these as ‘‘test buoys.’’ The first four
DART stations were in place by August 2000. The standard DART surface buoy
has  a  stated  design  life  of  one  year  and  the  seafloor  BPR  package  has  a  life  of
two years.

Q8a. Have  the  non-functioning  DART  buoys  and  BPRs  reached  their  expected  life,

or did they fail prematurely?

A8a. The  term  ‘‘design  life’’  used  in  this  context  does  not  refer  to  expected  failure
of  the  DART  stations,  but  rather  when  the  power  system  (batteries)  will  no  longer
be  sufficient  to  operate  the  electronics.  Thus  the  design  life  of  the  communication
package in the surface buoy was one year and of the bottom pressure unit was two
years.  The  failures  mentioned  by  VADM  Lautenbacher  were  unanticipated  and  did
not result from battery failure.

113

Q8b. Since 2000, what has been the reliability of the DART buoys?
A8b. The  reliability  of  the  DART  stations  since  October  2003,  the  time  when  they
were  transitioned  from  being  operated  by  NOAA  Research  to  NOAA’s  National
Weather  Service,  has  been  72  percent.  This  represents  the  combined  number  of
hours the stations have been operational.
Q8c. BPRs  have  been  deployed  in  the  Pacific  (without  the  DART  buoy)  since  1985.
I understand that they have a designed life of 15–24 months. What is the actual
reliability of the BPR.

A8c. It  is  very  difficult  to  ascertain  the  reliability  of  the  bottom  pressure  recorders
themselves.  The  majority  of  DART  BPR  failures,  since  October  2003  (operational
date),  have  not  been  a  result  of  failure  actual  pressure  unit  itself,  but  rather  do  to
other  causes,  such  as  failure  of  cable  connectors.  All  of  the  bottom  pressure  record-
ers are currently operating.
Q8d. Admiral Lautenbacher classified the DART as a ‘‘test’’ system. With four years
of  deployment  at  sea,  how  much  additional  testing  is  required  before  we  can
be  confident  about  making  the  investment  in  deploying  these  recorders  and
buoys  worldwide  and  that  the  technology  is  sufficiently  reliable  to  justify  the
investment?

A8d. NOAA believes the research and development efforts done with the six station
DART  pathfinder  network  have  defined  what  can  and  cannot  be  accomplished  with
these  detection  capabilities.  We  are  in  the  process  of  designing  built-in  redundant
capabilities  where  feasible  to  ensure  a  longer  lifetime  of  the  stations.  We  are  con-
fident  that  once  the  full  DART  II  network  is  deployed,  the  U.S.  will  have  an  oper-
ational  configuration  providing  near  100  percent  tsunami  detection  capability  with
embedded redundancy.
Q9. The DOD’s National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is making its satellite maps
available to the USAID and other government agencies in their relief operations.
The  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  also  maps  ocean  contours  to  sup-
port  the  strategic  mission  of  our  submarine  fleet.  We  know  from  the  experience
in  the  devastating  1998  Papua  New  Guinea  tsunami  that  undersea  landslides
can dramatically increase the severity of tsunamis. What kind of information is
available  from  the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  that  could  be  used
to  identify  high-risk  tsunami  areas?  Are  there  ways  to  provide  this  information
to  NOAA  and  the  others  involved  with  the  installation  of  a  tsunami  warning
system that will not compromise national security?

A9. NOAA  will  use  all  available  data  and  information  to  strengthen  the  U.S.  Tsu-
nami Warning System. The Department of Defense and/or the National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency are best suited to answer these specific compromise national se-
curity.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  John  A.  Orcutt,  Deputy  Director,  Research  at  the  Scripps  Institution

of Oceanography; President, American Geophysical Union

Q1. If you could change one or two things about the Administration’s proposal, what

would it be and why?

A1. Develop a long-term plan and funding to operate and maintain the DART buoy
system  given  that  O&M  costs  will  exceed  the  initial  capital  costs  in  only  3–4  years
of  operation.  Approaches  include  a  plan  to  increase  the  breadth  of  measurements
made  through  collaboration  with  the  NSF  Ocean  Observatories  Initiative  and  the
identification of NOAA funding for O&M.

Include the NSF in funding planning given that they support the O&M for nearly
a  third  of  the  GSN  and  have  supported  the  full  costs  (NSF  and  USGS)  of  new  sta-
tion installation and station upgrades in the past two decades.
Q2. Recommendations to improve the Administration’s Tsunami Plan:

The following is a list of recommendations made by the witnesses to improve the
Administration’s plan. It would be helpful to have comments on each of the rec-
ommendations.
Do you agree with the recommendation that:
• More  attention  should  be  paid  to  education,  especially  for  tsunamis  that  are
either  generated  close  to  shore  or  are  generated  by  events  that  cannot  be  felt.
A. Absolutely. In the case of the Indian Ocean the enormous loss of life could have
been greatly reduced, almost eliminated, if there had been a long-term plan in place
for  teaching  natural  hazards  throughout  the  region.  There  may  be  no  technical  ap-
proaches  that  can  save  populations  near  the  tsunami  source  too  little  time.  Seattle
is an analogous case in the U.S.

• Hazard mapping efforts should be expanded.

A. This  is  an  important  activity  from  inundation  estimation  to  likely  sources  of
tsunamis  including  earthquake,  volcanoes  and  seafloor  slumping.  Inundation  map-
ping  depends  a  great  deal,  for  example,  on  detailed,  high-resolution  topographic
mapping offshore and onshore.

• More money should be allocated to local warning systems and research to im-

prove them.

A. Yes, this is probably most important for carrying out the educational goals men-
tioned above. Local and regional communities could also support the installation, op-
eration  and  maintenance  of  technical  systems  installed  including  seismograph,  tide
gauges and cameras.

• There  should  be  a  greater  and  more  explicit  commitment  to  operation  and

maintenance costs of the buoys.

A. Yes,  this  is  a  major  problem  for  extending  the  lives  of  buoys  over  decades.  In
a  biologically  productive  environment  buoys  have  to  be  entirely  replaced  over  the
course of a very few years, for example, because of intensive biofouling.

• Redundant buoys should be purchased and funds should be allocated to devel-

oping better buoys.

A. A  better  approach  is  likely  a  transition  to  entirely  new  buoy  designs  including
those being contemplated for use by the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative. In the
case of Cascadia, the OOI will include seafloor, fiber optical-connected nodes on the
seafloor  throughout  the  area  precluding  the  use  of  buoys  entirely  for  relevant  tsu-
nami measurements.

• More  work  should  be  done  on  tsunami  probabilities  to  better  site  the  buoys.
A. Yes,  first  understand  the  earthquake  hazard  in  an  area  as  well  as  forecasts  of
activity to prioritize the installation of buoys.

• The  buoys  should  be  equipped  with  more  instruments  to  be  better  integrated

into NOAA and NSF research programs.

A. Yes, I agree. The current small buoys with very limited power and telemetry are
not well suited for supporting a broad suite of sensors.

• Tsunami  efforts  should  be  incorporated  into  the  development  of  a  broader

multi-hazard warning system.

• The  Global  Seismic  Network  should  be  expanded  and  should  include  new
• NSF  funding  should  be  provided  to  properly  fund  the  operation  and  mod-

kinds of equipment.

ernization of the Global Seismic Network.

A. Yes,  the  NSF  operates  approximately  one-third  of  the  Global  Seismic  Network
and  has,  in  the  past,  funded  nearly  all  the  costs  for  new  station  installations  and
upgrades for both the NSF and USGS portions of the network. Most of the stations
operated in the Indian Ocean are NSF’s responsibility.

• The Advanced National Seismic System should be expanded.

A. The  ANSS  has  concentrated  largely  on  urban  seismology  and  urban  earthquake
hazards.  Subsequent  to  my  testimony  researchers  have  used  many  (1200  –1400)
seismographs in Japan to map the Sumatra earthquake fault propagation. Had the
data been available in real-time, this technique could have significantly reduced the
time  needed  to  identify  the  event  as  a  Great  Earthquake.  The  ANSS  could  serve
the same purpose, but the goals of ANSS will have to be changed substantially.
Q3. What  are  the  biggest  gaps  in  our  scientific  understanding  of  tsunamis?  How

should the Administration address these gaps?

A3. Can  seismic  measurements  alone  be  used  to  predict  tsunamis?  This  certainly
isn’t  possible  now.  Can  detailed  earthquake  source  parameterizations  be  used  to
predict  accurately  tsunami  generation  and  propagation?  Can  acoustic  sensors  be
used  to  couple  observations  of  fault  rupture  to  tsunami  creation?  There  are  a  large
number of excellent scientific questions to motivate high quality research. Presently,
there  is  no  viable  research  program  in  the  NSF,  NOAA,  or  the  USGS  nor  funding
available  to  university  scientists  for  competition.  It’s  very  difficult  to  develop  a  sci-
entific  career  in  studying  tsunamis.  The  NSF  would  be  best  able  to  manage  such
a research program.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Your  testimony  provided  an  estimated  $5  million  dollar  shortfall  in  annual  op-
eration  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  global  seismic  network  (GSN).  Dr.  Groat
indicated  the  President’s  future  budget  allocations  would  cover  operation  and
maintenance  costs  for  the  proposed  network  upgrades.  However,  he  also  stated
that funds to address the maintenance backlog were not being allocated. Will the
upgrades to the network as outlined in the President’s proposal increase the op-
eration  and  maintenance  cost  of  the  network  or  will  they  remain  the  same?  If
Dr.  Groat’s  assumption  is  correct,  that  operation  and  maintenance  cost  of  the
upgraded  network  will  be  covered,  but  the  backlog  is  not,  what  effect  will  that
have on the sustainability of the network?

A1. Part  of  the  costs  for  upgrading  the  GSN  are  to  be  devoted  to  modernization  of
the  connections  of  the  stations  to  the  Internet  for  near-real-time  data  delivery.  If
this  is  done  using  modern  commercial  satellite  technologies,  the  reliability  of  the
network  could  be  greatly  increased  while  at  the  same  time  slightly  decreasing  the
actual costs of telemetry. The current medley of communications schemes including
phone  lines,  local  Internet  Service  Providers  (ISP),  satellite  sharing  with  the  UN,
and  others  is  an  ad  hoc  collection  of  methodologies  that  is  difficult  to  manage  and
varies widely in costs.

Increasing  the  number  of  stations  in  the  GSN  will  necessarily  increase  the  costs
of operating and maintaining the network. As I noted in my testimony, these O&M
costs vary from $60,00 to $75,000 per year. The current budget for O&M ($2M from
the NSF and $3M from the USGS) is inadequate for maintaining the network given
the projected costs of $8M to $1 OM. The UCSD component of the NSF-funded GSN
(40  stations)  receives  approximately  $2MJyr  for  O&M  while  the  projected  costs  are
40 X $60K = $2.4M/yr to 40 X $75K = $3M so the bulk of the shortfall is in USGS
support.  The  current  USGS  shortfall  of  $2M  to  $4M  will  grow  with  an  increasing
number of stations.

Long-term  underfunding  of  the  GSN  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  system  reli-
ability and, because installed infrastructure will not be regularly modernized, main-
tenance costs will increase faster than inflation.
Q2. I understand the current seismic monitors are no longer manufactured, the mon-
itors have been in place for a number of years, and they may need to be replaced
to maintain the performance goals of data acquisition from the network. Are you
aware of any plans at NSF or USGS to acquire replacement seismometers? Has
USGS or NSF identified a potential manufacturer for these seismometers? What

116

is  the  estimated  cost  to  replace  the  existing  network  and  over  what  time  frame
will this replacement need to take place?

A2. The  seismometers  used  to  establish  the  GSN  built  by  Swiss  and  US  manufac-
turers are no longer available. These include the highest quality sensors (Swiss) in-
tended  for  installation  in  vaults  and  borehole  sensors  (US).  The  NSF  is  currently
funding  a  project  at  Scripps  Institution  of  Oceanography/University  of  California
San Diego to develop a new optical seismometer. The original designer of the Swiss
seismometer  is  working  with  scientists  and  engineers  at  Scripps  in  this  develop-
ment.  The  prototype  recorded  the  Sumatra  earthquake  on  26  December  with  great
fidelity.  The  seismometer  has  a  substantially  larger  dynamic  range  than  existing
systems  and  because  of  the  lack  of  sophisticated  electronics,  may  be  less  expensive
to manufacture.

Several  commercial  companies, 

(US),  and
Nanometrics  (Canada)  are  also  developing  new  seismometers  based  on  classical
principles.  Their  markets,  however,  are  programs  such  as  the  Advanced  National
Seismic  System  (USGS)  and  USArray  (NSF)  that  require  large  numbers  of  less  ca-
pable instruments.
Q3. Your  points  about  the  National  Science  Foundation  are  well-taken.  Is  this  a
question of ensuring NSF’s participation with NOAA and USGS as the network
upgrades and development take place or do you recommend additional research
funding at NSF above the current earthquake research program?

including  Guralp

A3. Generally,  transferring  funds  between  agencies  is  problematic  and  I  am  con-
cerned  that  limited  appreciation  for  the  key  role  played  by  the  NSF  and  lack  of
specificity  in  the  tsunami  bill  will  limit  significantly  funding  needed  for  upgrading
the components of the GSN supported by the NSF.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Arthur  L.  Lerner-Lam,  Director,  Columbia  University  Center  for  Haz-

ards and Risk Research

Q1. If you could change one or two things about the Administration’s proposal, what

would it be and why?

A1. The Administration should increase the emphasis on public awareness and edu-
cation at the State community level, coordinated with comparative risk assessments
for  coastal  regions.  This  would  improve  use  of  warnings,  and  increase  support  for
mitigation  actions.  NOAA’s  TsunamiReady  program,  which  was  described  at  the
hearing,  is  an  example  that  should  be  expanded  in  a  multi-hazard  context.  Invest-
ments in the tsunami warning system should be part of a broader initiative for mul-
tiple  hazard  monitoring,  including  integrated  ocean  observations.  Tsunamis,  while
extreme,  are  not  the  most  damaging  hazard  as  measured  by  annualized  risk.  Risk
should inform the deployment of warning and observation systems, hazard reduction
programs  and  mitigation  policy.  A  quick  technological  fix  driven  by  hindsight  may
not be the best use of the Nation’s resources.
Q2. Recommendations to improve the Administration’s tsunami plan:

• More attention should be paid to public education, especially for tsunamis that
are  either  generated  close  to  shore  or  are  generated  by  events  that  cannot  be
felt.

A. I agree that more attention should be paid to improving public awareness of nat-
ural  threats,  including  tsunamis.  This  awareness  should  include  concrete  instruc-
tions  for  community-based  as  well  as  individual  preparedness  and  response.  The
public  education  program  should  include  training  for  first  responders,  emergency
managers, and other local community officials. For cases without adequate warning,
such as tsunamis generated close to shore or unobserved tsunami-triggering events,
the public’s ability to respond is both the first and last line of defense. Schools pro-
vide an effective training environment, but the effort could also include public serv-
ice  announcements,  free  publications,  library  and  museum  exhibits,  and  university
outreach.  It  will  be  important  to  provide  a  conduit  between  research  organizations,
particularly  those  that  are  mapping  potential  risks  and  modeling  hazard  scenarios,
and the public outreach process, so that the most current information is made avail-
able proactively.

• Hazard  mapping  efforts  should  be  expanded:  This  is  certainly  necessary,  but

should be done on several levels.

A. One  of  the  most  important  components  of  a  comprehensive  hazard  mapping  ef-
fort  is  accurate  mapping  of  near-shore  topography  and  bathymetry  with  improved
spatial  resolution.  The  most  accurate  global  data  set  of  topography  is  the  C-band
map produced by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). This map has 30
m resolution, and while the mission provided near global coverage, only the United
States  coverage  is  openly  available.  Elsewhere,  only  a  degraded  image  with  90  m
resolution  is  available.  This  is  insufficient  for  accurate  coastal  hazard  mapping  on
a global basis. The Administration should declassify the SRTM global data set. More
can  be  written  about  this.  High-resolution  bathymetric  maps  are  available  in  se-
lected  areas,  but  the  choice  of  regions  to  be  mapped  has  been  governed  by  reasons
other  than  risk  assessment.  The  Administration  should  develop  plans  to  acquire
high-resolution  bathymetric  data  in  areas  prioritized  by  natural  hazard  risk.  Topo-
graphic and bathymetric data should be openly available for research and analysis,
because the processing of the raw data for accurate topography and bathymetry, es-
pecially  near  the  coastline,  is  a  difficult  and  error-prone  exercise.  The  development
of  accurate  high-resolution  bathymetric  and  topographic  maps  at  the  coastline  will
benefit  from  the  vigorous  attention  from  research  oceanographers  and  quantitative
geomorphologists.  The  best  defense  against  incorrect  maps  is  an  open  data  philos-
ophy that allows continuing assessment of the quality of the data and the incorpora-
tion of new research results into the operational raw data processing. An additional
component  of  hazard  mapping  is  the  integration  of  socio-economic  data  sets  with
geophysical hazard maps in order to quantify specific vulnerabilities.

• More money should be allocated to local warning systems and research to im-

prove them.

A. I  infer  that  this  question  refers  to  the  dissemination  of  authoritative  warnings
by  local  communities  and  the  communication  of  warnings  in  an  informative  and
community-calibrated way to first responders and the public. I agree with the need

for  more  research  on  how  warnings  should  be  prioritized  and  characterized  so  that
the public is adequately informed in a manner that suppresses a panic response and
achieves  the  desired  results.  This  is  an  important  area  of  research  in  decision  the-
ory,  decision  making  under  uncertainty,  risk  perception,  and  techniques  of  risk
management.

• There  should  be  greater  and  more  explicit  commitment  to  operations  and

maintenance costs of the buoys.

A. The  version  of  the  Administration’s  proposal  I  reviewed  prior  to  the  26  January
hearing was not explicit. There is concern among those with experience with oceano-
graphic instrumentation that the difficult deployment and operating environment in
the oceans will exact a toll on even well-designed buoys. NOAA appears to recognize
this,  but  a  continuing  R&D  program  for  instrument  development  that  would  im-
prove the O&M profile of globally dispersed deployments must be part of the Admin-
istration’s package.

• Redundant buoys should be purchased and funds should be allocated to devel-

oping better buoys.

A. The  Administration  should  provide  funds  for  a  well-scoped  instrumentation  re-
search  and  development  program.  ‘‘Better  buoys’’  comprises  instruments  that  last
longer  and  have  reduced  O&M  costs.  The  term  can  also  refer  to  improvements  to
the software that detects the passage of a tsunami wave. Given current deployment
plans, concern remains that there is inadequate redundancy in the number of buoys
requested.

• More  work  should  be  done  on  tsunami  probabilities  to  better  site  the  buoys.
A. This  is  a  complex  problem  rooted  in  both  tsunami  and  earthquake  science.  The
Sumatra-Andaman  earthquake  that  generated  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami  was  the
largest  earthquake  ever  recorded  by  high-fidelity  digital  seismographs,  which  were
largely  put  in  place  beginning  in  the  seventies.  As  a  consequence,  the  event  has
spawned  a  tremendous  amount  of  research  on  the  dynamics  of  large  earthquake
sources.  We  are  at  a  turning  point  in  our  understanding  about  giant  earthquakes
and our ability to anticipate their occurrence and tsunamigenic potential. However,
in  the  absence  of  well-founded  models  of  extreme  events  (rare-occurrence,  high-im-
pact),  the  siting  of  buoys  should  be  based  on  providing  adequate  coverage  of  poten-
tial  sites  of  tsunami  genesis  along  the  world’s  major  subduction  zones.  Past  experi-
ence is the most justifiable guide. Buoy siting is also governed by the ability of tsu-
nami  detection  algorithms  to  characterize  the  propagating  tsunami  disturbance  in
the  water.  This  is  reasonably  well  understood,  but  there  should  be  constant  im-
provement  in  the  algorithms  as  more  is  understood  about  tsunami  propagation.  Fi-
nally,  paleoseismological  and  paleo-tsunami  studies,  which  determine  the  spatial
and  temporal  distribution  of  tsunamis  from  historical  and  geological  records,  can
help  prioritize  placement  by  developing  recurrence  histories  in  major  subduction
zones. Examples include studies performed along the Cascadia margin, and in other
areas  around  the  world.  Existing  studies  should  be  inventoried,  and  new  ones  per-
formed where needed.

• The  buoys  should  be  equipped  with  more  instruments  to  be  better  integrated

into NOAA and NSF research programs.

A. While  there  are  many  current  and  pending  NOAA  and  NSF  research  programs
that  could  benefit  from  the  infrastructure  put  in  place  for  a  tsunami  warning  sys-
tem,  the  current  design  of  the  buoys  is  focused  on  solving  the  tsunami  problem.  In
principle, the buoys could be a platform for complementary geophysical observations
by  providing  a  modular  solution  to  remote  power  and  telecommunications  issues.
For  example,  a  seafloor  instrument  package  containing  seismometers  could  be
linked to the buoy communications and power platform. The deployment of seafloor
seismometers  would  enhance  the  capabilities  of  the  Global  Seismographic  Network
for tsunami-generating event detection and characterization. The placement of other
sensors, including sensors in the water column, should be explored. However, a bet-
ter  approach  might  be  to  develop  a  broader  modular  approach  to  in  situ  oceano-
graphic instrumentation infrastructure (in which the tsunami buoys could be a com-
ponent), rather than modify the purpose-built tsunami system.

• Tsunami  efforts  should  be  incorporated  into  the  development  of  a  broader

multi-hazard warning system.

A. This  is  a  good  idea  in  principle.  In  practice,  this  strategy  is  effective  when  the
underlying  natural  hazards  overlap  in  spatial  extent  and  the  nature  of  their  im-
pacts. Once this is established, it is important to look at ways in which the prepara-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:17 Jun 20, 2005 Jkt 098395 PO 00000 Frm 00122 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\012605\98395 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

119

tion for and response to different hazards overlap. Fundamentally, a tsunami warn-
ing  system  could  be  integrated  into  a  more  expansive  integrated  ocean  and  coastal
observing  system.  The  most  likely  candidate  for  rapid  progress  is  linking  tsunami
warning  instrumentation  to  coastal  storm  surge  monitoring.  Underlying  this  rea-
soning  is  the  simple  observation  that  on  an  annualized  basis,  other  hazards  are
more frequent and damaging. A single-purpose hazard warning system implemented
for an extreme yet infrequent event class will not provide the most cost-effective ap-
proach to overall hazard reduction. Design studies should be initiated.

• The  Global  Seismic  Network  should  be  expanded  and  should  include  new

kinds of equipment.

A. The Global Seismic Network should be expanded to include ocean bottom instru-
mentation,  particularly  in  equatorial  ocean  basins  and  the  northern  Pacific  where
tsunami  generation  potential  is  greatest.  The  GSN  should  be  improved  to  provide
real time data from 100 percent of its stations with 90 percent reliability. With the
exception  of  these  considerations,  the  GSN  has  achieved  many  of  its  design  goals
for the research community. Improving its operational utility for warning is the next
priority. This can be done by regionally densifying the GSN by forming collaborative
relationships  with  regional  and  national  networks  around  the  world,  by  adding  te-
lemetry  to  stations  without  it,  and  by  increasing  quality  control  and  maintenance
operations to approach 90 percent up-time rates. Other equipment that might be in-
cluded  at  GSN  sites  includes  telecommunications  nodes,  infrasound  sensors,  mag-
netic observatories, and complementary geophysical instrumentation such as gravity
and  magnetic  field  sensors.  The  basic  GSN  system  has  been  designed  in  a  modular
fashion  that  should  make  the  addition  of  other  instrumentation  a  straightforward
engineering exercise.

• NSF  funding  should  be  provided  to  properly  fund  the  operation  and  mod-

ernization of the GSN.

A. The  GSN  serves  both  research  and  mission  communities,  and  is  one  of  the  fore-
most  examples  of  such  a  dual-use  network.  NSF  funds  the  GSN  as  part  of  its  com-
mitment  to  the  Nation’s  research  enterprise.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  also  par-
ticipates,  with  separate  funding  in  its  budget  for  network  operations.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Interior’s  responsibility  in  providing  partial  support  should  be  emphasized
and  the  Administration  should  assure  long-term  funding  for  the  U.S.G.S.  The  data
management and archive is managed by IRIS and funded by the NSF. This funding
should  be  sustained  through  the  standard  NSF  process  of  peer  review.  Whether
NSF  should  provide  funding  for  a  monitoring  operation  is  not  at  issue:  as  long  as
Earth  Science  Instrumentation  and  Facilities  is  sufficiently  funded  (as  long  as  the
NSF R&RA account is sufficient), IRIS can compete in a community peer-review en-
vironment  for  continued  operation  of  the  GSN.  It  is  estimated  that  an  additional
$10M will be needed over five years to fully fund and modernize the GSN. It is also
important  to  note  the  quality  control  of  the  GSN  is  critically  dependent  on  the  ac-
tivities  of  the  U.S.  university  research  community  in  using  the  data  and  assessing
its quality continuously. This implies that continued health of the GSN is also con-
tingent  on  funding  for  basic  research  in  earthquake  science  and  Earth  structure,
through the NSF, and through the USGS external grants program.

• The ANSS should be expanded.

A. Within  the  U.S.,  the  ANSS  comprises  a  national  scale  backbone  network  and  a
several  regional  networks  with  regional  operational  and  outreach  responsibilities.
Authoritative  detection  and  characterization  of  events  is  the  responsibility  of  the
National  Earthquake  Information  Center  in  Golden.  The  NEIC  will  be  enhanced  to
provide 24/7 operation under the Administration’s plan. However, the capitalization,
operations  and  maintenance  of  the  ANSS  are  limited  by  a  level  of  funding  well
below  authorized  amounts.  For  the  purposes  of  a  tsunami  warning,  the  ANSS
should expand real-time capabilities in the Pacific Northwest, in Alaska, and in the
Caribbean, to quickly locate and characterize tsunamigenic earthquakes. In the rest
of  the  country,  the  ANSS  should  be  fully  funded  at  authorized  level  so  that  there
can be timely and accurate characterizations of earthquakes within U.S. borders.
Q3. What specific recommendations would you give to the administration on how to
use  the  current  momentum  to  build  an  international  tsunami  warning  system
to  test  its  concept  of  building  a  comprehensive  global  Earth  observing  system?
A3. A  tsunami  warning  system  integrates  observations  from  various  in  situ  geo-
physical  sensors.  The  successful  integration  from  different  systems,  including  the
data  format,  open  data  exchange,  real  time  telecommunications,  rapid  analysis,
archiving, and assessment are all components of what should be achieved by a glob-

al Earth observing system. The use of satellite remote sensing in rapidly character-
izing damage by comparing before and after scenes implies that data integration of
geophysical  data  with  socio-economic  data  should  also  be  operationalized.  The  most
important  parts  of  an  international  observing  system  are:  (1)  the  free  and  open  ex-
change  of  data  from  global,  national  and  regional  systems  so  that  all  information
is  available  for  immediate  use  when  needed,  and  (2)  improving  the  capacity  of  all
nations  to  use  the  observations,  and  tailoring  the  information  products  to  different
national and regional circumstances. The Administration should emphasize that the
building  of  a  global  observation  system  should  be  based  on  the  free  and  open  ex-
change of all geophysical data, its use in hazards reduction, and its use in research
collaborations.  International  research  collaborations  will  build  scientific  and  tech-
nical  capacity  throughout  the  world  and  will  build  confidence  that  the  exchange  of
data  has  local  benefits.  Ultimately,  this  exchange  of  research  results  will  improve
the  operations  of  the  tsunami  and  other  hazard  warning  system,  improve  their  use
by  local  communities,  and  provide  a  higher  level  of  technical  capacity  comple-
menting and supporting broader international development goals.
Q4. What  are  the  most  serious  natural  hazard  threats  facing  the  United  States
today?  Please  provide  specific  examples  of  how  response  plans  for  these  threats
could  be  integrated  with  the  tsunami  risk  reduction  program  proposed  by  the
Administration.

A4. Earthquakes,  drought,  flooding,  severe  storms  and  hurricanes,  and  coastal  ero-
sion  are  all  serious  natural  hazard  threats  faced  by  the  United  States  today.  The
regional  distribution  of  these  threats  varies  of  course,  but  this  is  reasonably  well
understood.  Threats  specific  to  the  coasts  include  hydrometeorological  and  earth-
quake/landslide  hazards  whose  understanding  and  warning  would  benefit  from  an
enhanced multiple hazard observation and warning system. The simplest way to in-
tegrate the multi-hazard response is to include multiple hazards in the coastal risk
mapping that is proposed in the Administration’s tsunami program. Once these mul-
tiple hazards risk are mapped and a quantitative risk comparison is made, the over-
lap  in  preparedness  and  response  strategies  could  be  investigated  to  provide  a  syn-
optic  and  cost-effective  coastal  warning  system  for  multiple  hazards.  A  first  step
would  be  to  integrate  storm  surge  and  coastal  flooding  warnings  with  severe  storm
and tsunami warning.
Q5. What  are  the  biggest  gaps  in  our  scientific  understanding  of  tsunamis?  How

should the Administration address these gaps?

A5. The biggest gaps are: occurrence probabilities of different tsunamigenic events,
the  tsunami  source  function  (how  different  events  actually  produce  the  water  dis-
turbance that becomes a tsunami), the dynamics of run-up and near-shore propaga-
tion,  which  are  highly  non-linear  and  critically  dependent  on  relatively  unknown
coastal  bathymetry,  and  data  integration  to  understand  the  potential  impacts  of
tsunamis  on  populations,  livelihoods,  and  economic  output.  The  Administration
should address these gaps with both basic and applied research programs in earth-
quake  and  tsunami  research,  a  coastal  bathymetric  mapping  program,  and  an  ap-
plied  and  basic  research  program  in  risk  assessment  and  management.  There  are
specific  gaps  in  the  our  assessment  and  understanding  of  different  strategies  for
making  use  of  the  warning  on  local  or  community  levels.  Current  programs  should
be assessed, and social science research should be conducted so that we understand
how to best assess and communicate risk, and develop policies to reduce or manage
risk. Despite the gaps in our understanding of tsunami and earthquake sources, this
does  not  mean  that  action  on  developing  warning  and  observation  systems  should
be delayed. Rather, the Administration should ensure that the basic and applied re-
search  enterprise  is  healthy  and  conversant  with  operational  problems,  so  that  re-
search results can be communicated to the operations in a timely and effective man-
ner.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. Dr.  Orcutt’s  testimony  provided  an  estimated  $5  million  dollar  shortfall  in  an-
nual operation and maintenance costs for the global seismic network (GSN). Dr.
Groat  indicated  the  President’s  future  budget  allocations  would  cover  operation
and  maintenance  costs  for  the  proposed  network  upgrades.  However,  he  also
stated  that  funds  to  address  the  maintenance  backlog  were  not  being  allocated.
Will the upgrades to the network as outlined in the President’s proposal increase
the operation and maintenance cost of the network or will they remain the same?
If Dr. Groat’s assumption is correct, that operation and maintenance cost of the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:17 Jun 20, 2005 Jkt 098395 PO 00000 Frm 00124 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\012605\98395 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

121

upgraded  network  will  be  covered,  but  the  backlog  is  not,  what  effect  will  that
have on the sustainability of the network?

A1. The  O&M  cost  impacts  of  the  upgrades  to  the  GSN,  which  include  achieving
100 percent telemetry and 90 percent up-time, are expected to amount to $5 to $7M/
yr. additional, with half allocated to NSF and half allocated to the USGS. However,
there  is  a  maintenance  backlog  that  is  associated  with  hardware  upgrades  to  older
instruments  and  maintaining  a  spare  parts  inventory.  Sustainable  operation  of  the
GSN is dependent on clearing the maintenance backlog.
Q2. I understand the current seismic monitors are no longer manufactured, the mon-
itors have been in place for a number of years, and they may need to be replaced
to maintain the performance goals of data acquisition from the network. Are you
aware of any plans at NSF or USGS to acquire replacement seismometers? Has
USGS or NSF identified a potential manufacturer for these seismometers? What
is  the  estimated  cost  to  replace  the  existing  network  and  over  what  time  frame
will this replacement need to take place?

A2. The IRIS consortium funded by the NSF has held several manufacturer discus-
sions  and  community  workshops  to  address  the  problem  of  very-broad-band  seis-
mometer  obsolescence.  However,  a  manufacturer  of  replacement  instruments  has
not  been  identified.  This  decision  and  associated  research  should  rightly  be  funded
through  the  NSF  instrumentation  and  facilities  program,  because  the  instruments
will  be  crucial  to  basic  research.  Replacement  costs  for  the  instruments  are  likely
to be in the range of $10M over five years. The NSF is also running an instrumenta-
tion  research  program,  which  is  funding  development  of  several  promising  sensor
technologies. It is not clear at this time whether these new technologies will be suit-
able for production sensors in the near future.
Q3. You  made  a  persuasive  case  for  considering  a  multi-hazard  approach  to  reduc-
ing  national  vulnerabilities.  The  plan  we  have  before  us  is  designed  to  address
the  earthquake  and  tsunami  hazard.  What  additional  features  would  this  plan
contain  if  we  were  taking  a  multi-hazard  approach?  What  do  you  see  as  the
major  barriers  to  adopting  a  multi-hazard  approach  to  disaster  planning  and
mitigation?  How  do  these  barriers  differ  for  the  wealthy  and  less  wealthy  na-
tions?

A3. Additional features of the plan to address multi-hazard comprise (1) assessment
of  multi-hazard  risks,  particularly  in  the  coastal  areas  of  the  United  States,  to  de-
termine the geographic and temporal distribution of multiple hazard occurrence and
impacts;  (2)  common  approaches  for  preparedness  and  response  for  hazards  having
similar impact/damage scenarios and common or overlapping risk occurrence; (3) de-
velopment  of  integrated  geophysical  instrument  networks  with  the  ability  to  direct
specific  real-time  data  streams  to  the  relevant  analytical  tools  for  specific  hazard
characterization  and  warning/response;  (4)  encouraging  an  all-hazard  approach  for
communities  facing  multiple  risks;  first  responders  and  relief  teams  should  be
trained  in  multiple  risk  management  or  response  so  that  technical  and  operational
efficiencies  and  cross-fertilization  can  be  pursued.  Major  barriers  to  multi-hazard
approach  include:  (1)  a  national  risk  management  strategy  that  focuses  on  indi-
vidual  hazards,  even  in  regions  where  risks  from  several  hazards  are  comparable;
(2)  dispersal  of  risk  assessment,  hazard  observation  and  management  functions
among different agencies, (3) a heterogeneous public-private environment for imple-
menting  risk  management  policies.  Differences  between  wealthy  and  less  wealthy
nations  include  the  understandable  tendency  for  less  wealthy  nations  to  discount
the  risk  from  future  events  when  weighed  against  more  immediate  humanitarian
concerns. Further, a ‘‘one-size-fits-all’’ technical approach is less likely to succeed in
less-developed  countries  because  of  mismatches  in  technical  and  administrative  ca-
pacity. Implementation must be tailored to the social, technical, administrative and
cultural conditions in different countries and regions. Also, open data exchange and
collaborative  research  are  not  yet  universally  acknowledged  by  all  parties  as  a
foundational  element  of  global  multi-hazard  observation  and  warning:  many  coun-
tries  seek  to  develop  self-contained  systems,  which  are  problematic,  as  a  matter  of
national  pride.  Linking  natural  hazard  risk  management  to  broader  international
economic and political development goals may be one approach to these issues.
Q4. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) has been mentioned
numerous  times  in  connection  with  this  tsunami  detection  and  warning  system.
However, it is unclear how far along the real planning for GEOSS has come and
whether  there  have  been  substantive  discussions  of  how  the  tsunami  network
would  fit  into  the  system.  You  seem  to  believe  the  deployment  of  this  network

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:17 Jun 20, 2005 Jkt 098395 PO 00000 Frm 00125 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\012605\98395 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

122

could  serve  as  a  pilot  for  GEOSS.  How  would  you  envision  a  pilot  program  to
link these two visions—one of which (GEOSS) seems quite undeveloped?

A4. I  agree  that  GEOSS  plans  are  dominated  by  technological  descriptions  of  the
system,  without  a  considered  science  plan  that  includes  natural  hazard  reduction
elements. A tsunami warning system would be an interesting pilot, because a prop-
erly  formulated  warning  system  would  (1)  illustrate  the  technical  approaches  to  in-
tegrating diverse data streams from different instrumentation; (2) show how the re-
sults of basic research could be applied in a timely and concrete way to the charac-
terization of a difficult phenomenon; (3) show the value of linking basic and applied
research  collaborations,  integrated  observations,  and  open  data  exchange  not  only
to  the  safety  of  wealthy  countries,  but  to  the  building  the  scientific  and  technical
capacity of less wealthy ones, and (4) show how information products can be derived
to meet the needs of diverse constituencies.
Q5. Your  points  about  the  National  Science  Foundation  are  well-taken.  Is  this  a
question of ensuring NSF’s participation with NOAA and USGS as the network
upgrades and development take place or do you recommend additional research
funding at NSF above the current earthquake research program?

A5. NSF has a role to play in ensuring that the GSN remains healthy, through the
competitive  peer  review  process  for  geoscience  instrumentation  and  facilities  that
has served IRIS and the GSN so well. Moreover, since we are dealing with new un-
derstanding  of  dangerous  phenomena,  NSF  has  a  role  to  play  in  funding  the  basic
research  that  ensures  that  the  United  States  maintains  a  healthy  Earth  and  envi-
ronmental  science  research  profile,  supporting  research  in  the  new  technologies  for
new  generations  of  instrumentation,  supporting  social  science  research  into  risk
management,  perception,  and  assessment,  and  support  for  the  new  thinking  about
how to link science outcomes to broad social goals. A tsunami warning system with-
out  basic  research  would  soon  be  obsolete,  ineffective,  and  a  waste.  Finally,  NSF  is
the  critical  link  in  maintaining  the  pipeline  supplying  a  technical  workforce  for,  in
this case, natural hazards reduction.

Question submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. The advancement of marine seismic research is allowing us to uncover data that
never  before  has  been  thought  possible.  The  knowledge  that  can  be  gained  from
this research is will paramount in aiding early warning detection systems. How-
ever,  with  limited  resources  available  we  need  to  make  sure  that  the  benefit  of
detection  systems  is  maximized.  Marine  seismic  research  is  now  able  to  detect
megathrusts  or  faults  where  larger  earthquakes  occur  within  subduction  zones,
similar  to  that  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  This  seems  to  be  the  first  step  in  imple-
menting  an  effective  detection  plan.  How  close  are  we  to  mapping  out  the  loca-
tions of these megathrusts so that the most successful actions can be taken?

A1. The technology for mapping the seafloor at high resolution exists, but the costs
of  doing  this  comprehensively  for  the  U.S.  is  generally  estimated  to  be  a  few  hun-
dred  million  dollars.  In  a  revenue-restricted  world,  the  mapping  should  be
prioritized  by  the  potential  exposure  of  people,  their  livelihoods,  their  assets,  and
the Nation’s economic productivity. Thus urban areas, ports, and critical ecosystems
should  be  mapped  comprehensively.  ‘‘Nested  mapping,’’  wherein  lower-resolution
mapping  permits  a  more  effective  design  of  high-resolution  surveys,  may  be  a  pro-
ductive strategy that can adapt to new information gathered at lower resolution by
oceanographers.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jay  Wilson,  Coordinator,  Earthquake  and  Tsunami  Programs,  Plans

and Training Section, Oregon Emergency Management

Q1. If you could change one or two things about the Administration’s proposal, what

would it be and why?

A1. Make the entire tsunami program under the direction of the National Tsunami
Hazard  Mitigation  Program  Executive  Steering  Committee  consisting  of  voting
members as follows:

• NOAA (two representatives—warning and tsunami inundation mapping),
• USGS  (two  representatives—seismic  network  and  geology  of  tsunami  sources

and deposits),

• FEMA (one representative),
• NSF (one representative)
• Oregon  (two  representatives—emergency  management  and  tsunami  hazard

• Washington  (two  representatives—emergency  management  and  tsunami  haz-

• California (two representatives—emergency management and tsunami hazard

mapping)

mapping),

• Hawaii  (two  representatives—emergency  management  and  tsunami  hazard

• Alaska  (two  representatives—emergency  management  and  tsunami  hazard

• Island  Territories  (two  voting  representatives  to  represent  all  of  the  terri-
tories—one  for  emergency  management  and  one  for  tsunami  hazard  map-
ping).

Add $7.8 million to the $35 million budget to fully implement the current NTHMP

goals, which include a strong education and inundation-mapping component.

Add $700,000 per state per year to fund ‘‘tsunami champions’’ in each vulnerable
community  who  would  organize  neighborhood  response  and  do  door-to-door  out-
reach.  Only  states  highly  vulnerable  to  locally  generated  tsunamis  would  receive
this  additional  support.  These  are  Alaska,  Hawaii,  Oregon,  Washington,  and  Cali-
fornia. The total would be an additional $3.4 million.
For  example,  in  Oregon  this  would  place  a  half-time  position  in  every  vulnerable
community.  For  Oregon,  you  would  need  ∼20  half-time  positions  with  some  travel,
mailing,  etc.,  costs.  This  would  amount  to  ∼19  x  $30,000  x  1.18  indirect  costs  =
$672,600/year  +  Oregon  Emergency  Management  and  Oregon  Dept.  of  Geology  and
Mineral  Industries  administrative  costs  for  the  community  grant  program  of
∼$10,000 per year for a total of $685,000 for a typical state. The grand total for the
five states would be ∼$3.43 million per year.
Q2. Recommendations to improve the Administration’s Tsunami Plan:

The following is a list of recommendations made by witnesses to improve the Ad-
ministration’s  plan.  It  would  be  helpful  to  have  comments  on  each  of  the  rec-
ommendations.
Do you agree with the recommendation that:
• More attention should be paid to education, especially for tsunami that are ei-

ther generated close to shore or are generated by events that cannot be felt.

A. Yes,  this  is  the  highest  priority  of  all  of  the  items  in  terms  of  lives  saved  per
dollar spent.

• Hazard mapping efforts should be expanded.

A. Yes,  education  is  useless  unless  the  hazard  is  defined  accurately  in  terms  of
where flooding can be expected and how soon the wave arrives.

• More money should be allocated to local warning systems and research to im-

prove them.

A. This is of lower importance than mapping and education in terms of lives saved
per dollar spent.

• There  should  be  a  greater  and  more  explicit  commitment  to  operation  and

maintenance costs of the buoys.

A. This is of lower importance than mapping and education in terms of lives saved
per dollar spent.

• Redundant  buoys  should  be  purchased  and  funds  allocated  to  developing  bet-

ter buoys.

A. This is of lower importance than mapping and education in terms of lives saved
per dollar spent.

• More  work  should  be  done  on  tsunami  probabilities  to  better  site  the  buoys.
A. Yes,  this  can  be  done  at  very  little  cost  and  could  yield  substantial  savings  by
maximizing the effectiveness of any buoys installed.

• The  buoys  should  be  equipped  with  more  instruments  to  be  better  integrated

into NOAA and NSF research programs.

A. Yes,  maintenance  and  installation  of  buoys  is  so  expensive  that  it  is  incumbent
on  NOAA  to  make  sure  that  they  give  data  on  weather,  wind  waves  and  any  other
possible data that can be produced.

• Tsunami  efforts  should  be  incorporated  into  the  development  of  a  broader

multi-hazard warning system.

A. Yes, any warning infrastructure should be multi-hazard.

• The  Global  Seismic  Network  should  be  expanded  and  should  include  new

kinds of equipment.

A. This  is  of  lower  importance  than  tsunami  hazard  mapping  and  response  edu-
cation in terms of lives saved per dollar spent.

• NSF  funding  should  be  provided  to  properly  fund  the  operation  and  mod-

ernization of the Global Seismic Network.

A. In  terms  of  tsunami  hazard  mitigation  for  locally  generated  tsunamis,  which
pose the greatest danger, three much higher priorities for NSF research are:

1. Improvement of tsunami modeling software, including fundamental research
into the numerical methods now used world-wide to simulate tsunami flood-
ing. All current methods suffer from energy losses and inaccurate simulation
of  dry  land  inundation  that  generally  cause  underestimation  of  the  hazard.
2. Improvement  of  fundamental  understanding  of  the  mechanics  behind  and
prediction  of  tsunami  fault  and  landslide  sources.  Uncertainty  in  these  pa-
rameters  translates  to  tsunami  hazard  mapping  uncertainties  on  the  order
of 50 to 100 percent (elevation and inland penetration of the waves).

3. Ground  truth  tsunami  simulations  by  improved  understanding  of  ancient
tsunami deposits. The past is the key to the present. Simulations should re-
produce current velocities and water depths consistent with ancient tsunami
deposits,  but  deriving  current  velocities  and  water  depths  from  the  deposits
needs  much  additional  research  both  in  the  field  for  modern  tsunamis  and
in the laboratory.

• The Advanced National Seismic System should be expanded.

A. This  is  of  lower  importance  than  tsunami  mapping  and  response  education  in
terms of lives saved per dollar spent. If the seismic networks in the Cascadia region
were  more  dense,  then  a  better  understanding  of  small  (M  4–5)  earthquakes  along
the fault boundary.
Q3. What  are  the  biggest  gaps  in  our  scientific  understanding  of  tsunami?  How

should the Administration address these gaps?

A3.

• Improvement  of  tsunami  modeling  software,  including  fundamental  research
into the numerical methods now used world-wide to simulate the flooding. All
current  methods  suffer  from  energy  losses  and  inaccurate  simulation  of  dry
land  inundation  that  generally  cause  under-estimation  of  the  hazard.  NSF
should  announce  a  special  program  and  proposal  solicitation  with  dedicated
funding aimed at this specific problem.
• Improvement of fundamental understanding of the mechanics behind and pre-
diction  of  tsunami  fault  and  landslide  sources.  Uncertainty  in  these  param-

eters  translates  to  tsunami  hazard  mapping  uncertainties  on  the  order  of  50
to  100  percent  (elevation  and  inland  penetration  of  the  waves).  NSF  should
announce  a  special  program  and  proposal  solicitation  with  dedicated  funding
aimed  at  this  specific  problem.  USGS  should  fully  fund  research  on
tsunamigenic landslides and faults. Work at NSF and USGS should be coordi-
nated through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program to focus the
research  on  tsunami  fault  and  landslide  sources  of  highest  priority  for  map-
ping of tsunami inundation by State geological surveys.

• Ground truth tsunami simulations by improved understanding of ancient tsu-
nami  deposits.  The  past  is  the  key  to  the  present.  Simulations  should  repro-
duce current velocities and water depths consistent with ancient tsunami de-
posits,  but  deriving  current  velocities  and  water  depths  from  the  deposits
needs much additional research both in the field for modern tsunamis and in
the laboratory. NSF should announce a special program and proposal solicita-
tion with dedicated funding aimed at this specific problem. USGS should fully
fund  paleoseismic  and  paleotsunami  research.  Work  at  NSF  and  USGS
should be coordinated through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Pro-
gram to focus the research on tsunami deposits of highest priority to ground-
truth  tsunami  inundation  simulations  used  by  State  geological  surveys  for
hazard mapping.

Questions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. What  is  the  estimated  cost  for  a  local  community  to  become  Tsunami  Ready?
What  is  the  average  annual  cost  of  operation  and  maintenance  to  local  commu-
nities  to  sustain  the  program?  How  often  do  your  Tsunami  Ready  communities
conduct drills?

A1. We  estimate  for  an  average  coastal  community  at  least  $10K  to  start  and  $5K
per year afterward for maintenance. The contributions in staff time for Lincoln City
Oregon  added  up  to  $15,000  over  the  past  two  years  for  certification.  Annual  costs/
in-kind contributions from Lincoln City include:

• Staff  time  (Public  Works—800  hours,  Emergency  Manager—400  hours,  cler-
ical—156 hours, and not including the City Manager’s time)
• Administrative costs (travel, Internet services, and training)
• Satellite fees
• Printing fees for publications
• NOAA Weather Radios from Radio Shack
• And State expenses (mapping, evacuations brochures, tsunami signs and staff

time)

Tsunami  evacuation  drills  for  schools  in  inundation  zones  are  mandated  at  least
once per year by State law. For other facilities or businesses it happen once per 2–
3 years for the most active communities.
Q2. How  are  your  Tsunami  Ready  and  Earthquake  preparedness  programs  con-
nected? If a large earthquake occurred close to shore would the earthquake dam-
age  to  communication  equipment  and  shelters  be  likely  to  prevent  evacuation
plans  from  being  executed?  Are  the  Tsunami  Ready  communities  also  earth-
quake-hardened?  Should  we  move  to  a  multiple  hazard-preparation  program  to
deal  comprehensively  with  multiple  hazards  that  particular  communities  face?
A2. TsunamiReady  is  merely  a  program  designed  to  give  recognition  for  the  base
minimum  level  of  preparedness  for  tsunamis,  not  earthquakes.  It  is  not  really  ade-
quate  for  full  mitigation  for  tsunamis  and  does  little  for  earthquake  mitigation.  A
near-shore  earthquake  would  likely  damage  communication  equipment,  but  there
would be little or no time to deliver an evacuation message anyway for an incoming
local tsunami.

Yes, large local earthquakes have the capacity to cause damage to communication
equipment  and  shelters  if  those  facilities  are  built  at  locations  vulnerable  to  lique-
faction  or  ground  amplification.  Additionally,  local  tsunamis  generated  from  local
earthquakes  will  likely  damage  much  of  the  communication  infrastructure  and
many  evacuation  shelters  where  shelters  are  not  specifically  designed  to  withstand
the earthquake. Note that in many cases bridges are the weakest links for executing
evacuation  plans  of  a  few  critical  areas  like  Seaside.  Bridges  area  major  problem
for long-term response and recovery, since they will isolate most coastal towns from
inland areas for weeks or months.

126

Tsunami  preparedness  works  well  for  a  great  many  other  hazards,  since  it  relies
on  good  education  beforehand  (really  the  only  effective  mitigation  for  a  locally  gen-
erated  tsunami),  emergency  response  planning  (command  and  control),  communica-
tion  systems,  and  emergency  resources  (food,  water,  medical  services,  and  shelter).
Q3. In  the  case  of  a  tsunami  generated  from  an  earthquake  far  off-shore,  have  you
experienced problems of spectators coming to vulnerable coastal areas to witness
the tsunami?

A3. These problems do occur and have not to date resulted in damage or loss of life.
However  it  does  point  out  the  need  for  continuing  education  of  both  full  time  and
transient populations in coastal areas.
Q4. What  role  does  NOAA  weather  radio  play  in  the  alert  dissemination  system  of

Storm Ready and Tsunami Ready?

A4. NOAA  weather  radio  is  a  valuable  resource  for  issuance  of  warnings  and  ‘‘all
clear’’  messages  for  distant  tsunamis  and  storms.  The  radio  is  not  as  useful  for  lo-
cally  generated  tsunamis  that  arrive  too  quickly  for  it  to  operate.  It  is  useful  for
delivering  guidance  to  local  officials  on  the  decrease  of  wave  activity  after  a  local
tsunami.
Q5. Has  it  been  difficult  to  sustain  funding  for  your  tsunami  hazards  programs  in
Oregon  given  that  tsunami  are  rare  occurrences  and  therefore  the  warning  sys-
tem may not be needed for decades?

A5. It has been virtually impossible to attract State resources other than a few one-
time  grants  in  the  early  years  of  the  State  mitigation  effort.  With  State  resources
not  able  to  keep  schools  open  a  full  school  year,  mitigation  of  a  rare  catastrophic
event is a low priority. The State has benefited from the National Tsunami Hazard
Mitigation Program (NTHMP) from its inception several years ago. Funding for fun-
damental tsunami hazard mapping and education from NTHMP (contracted through
NOAA)  is  the  reason  we  have  been  able  to  make  the  progress  we  have.  Funding
has been forthcoming because of the excellent federal-State partnership powered by
the  five  Pacific  states  having  a  majority  vote  in  the  Executive  Steering  Committee
of the NTHMP. When states have ownership and control of some substantial portion
of  the  funding,  the  resources  are  more  likely  to  be  targeted  efficiently  to  the  needs
of local government where all really effective mitigation occurs.

The  NOAA–NWS  tsunami  warning  system,  from  critiques  given  by  the  State
membership  of  the  NTHMP,  has  become  much  more  reliable.  States  insisted  on
elimination  of  false  warnings  for  distant  tsunamis  and  that  has  largely  occurred
mainly  by  some  structural  changes  in  the  way  warnings  are  issued  and  to  a  lesser
extent by implementation of the new buoy sensing technology.
Q6. How far along is Oregon in producing a full set of inundation maps for the Or-

egon coast? How often do you need to update these maps?

A6. Oregon  is  about  80  percent  of  the  way  to  finishing  inundation  maps  with  soft-
ware  that  was  developed  over  a  decade  ago.  Tsunami  modelers  have  suspected  for
some time that the prevalent software under predicts the flooding danger. The tech-
nology is poised for major advance as a result of knowledge gained from the Suma-
tra tsunami, but continued support will be needed for a number of different models
and centers of modeling excellence to advance the techniques.

Most  of  the  current  maps  of  complex  areas  like  bays  and  estuaries  should  be
redone  in  the  next  decade,  as  the  simulation  software  becomes  more  robust.  Once
this  new  generation  of  maps  is  complete,  little  updating  will  be  necessary.  Some
areas  with  relatively  simple  terrain  (cliffs  next  to  one  flat  area  close  to  the  shore-
line) will not need to be redone even with the improved software.
Q7. You  recommended  a  sustained  annual  allocation  of  $7.8  million  dollars  for  the
NTHMP.  This  figure  is  higher  than  the  figure  in  the  new  proposal  and  higher
than  current  expenditures.  How  did  you  arrive  at  this  figure?  What  activities
would be increased with the additional funding? Would this allow states to allo-
cate more funding to local communities to become Tsunami Ready?

A7. NOAA  arrived  at  this  figure  after  consultation  with  reviewers  of  the  NTHMP
and in consultation with the Executive Steering Committee of the NTHMP in 2002.
It achieves a modest increasing in the base level funding for ongoing tsunami inun-
dation  mapping,  public  education,  publication  of  products  from  the  five  Pacific
states, and maintenance of currently installed buoys and seismographs. The budget
also  adds  base  level  support  for  tsunami  mapping  and  mitigation  of  Caribbean  and
Pacific  island  territories.  The  budget  does  not  support  large  expansion  of  the  seis-
mograph or tsunami buoy network.

funding  to 

The  budget  would  accelerate  inundation  mapping  and  education  plus  allow  addi-
tional  improvement  of  the  warning  system  so  NOAA  could  predict  actual  flooding
impact of distant tsunamis rather than just issuing a generalized warning.

There  would  be 

local  communities  to  become  recognized  as
TsunamiReady, since there would be increased support of evacuation map brochure
production  and  installation  of  evacuation  signs.  There  would  not  be  adequate  fund-
ing  in  local  communities  to  completely  achieve  the  more  difficult  mitigation  goal:
creation of a ‘‘culture of response’’ so people would know instinctively that an earth-
quake is the warning to get to high ground. That goal requires an ongoing commit-
ment to public education and neighborhood emergency response. TsunamiReady, as
currently defined, does not achieve this.

Funding of a ‘‘tsunami champion’’ in every community to do the hard work of or-
ganizing  for  evacuation  and  reaching  out  door-to-door  and  neighborhood-by-neigh-
borhood would, in conjunction with school curricula, achieve the goal. This ‘‘tsunami
champion’’  would  be  at  least  a  half-time  position  for  every  vulnerable  community
and cost approximately an additional $700,000 for each of the five Pacific states.

Additionally,  participants  in  a  recent  Oregon  Tsunami  Workshop  with  over  90
representatives  from  seven  coastal  counties  and  State  agencies,  acknowledged  the
need  for  a  State  administered  grant  program  to  oversee  funding  of  local  emergency
infrastructure  (sirens,  emergency  caches  of  food,  medical  supplies  and  shelter,  and
satellite  phones).  We  propose  $1.3  million  for  the  first  year  with  a  similar  grant
amount for the next nine years to invest in coastal emergency communications that
would serve, not only tsunami, but also multiple hazard warnings. Over this 10-year
period  we  would  be  able  to  meet  the  requests  of  virtually  everything  on  the  work-
shop list.

STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF IMPROVED EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI HAZARD MITIGATION

BY STEVE MALONE, PRESIDENT,

THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

As compassionate people we are all saddened by the death and destruction caused
by  the  Sumatra  earthquake  and  resulting  tsunami,  but  as  seismologists  we  are  ad-
ditionally  dismayed  by  the  needless  deaths  since  tsunami  warning  systems  are  sci-
entifically and technologically possible. Indeed, many seismologists are reflecting on
our  discipline’s  responsibility  for  the  extent  of  the  human  suffering.  However,  this
reflection  is  rarely  on  what  more  we  could  have  done  scientifically  and  more  often
on  our  inability  to  translate  and  disseminate  our  knowledge  in  a  way  that  might
have made a difference. We have the understanding and technology to rapidly issue
warnings  for  tsunamis  based  on  seismic  and  oceanographic  data  (and  already  issue
warnings  for  the  Pacific  Basin).  We  publish  scientific  papers  about  our  under-
standing of past events and the way geology works, often with an eye to anticipating
future  hazardous  events.  With  all  of  this  knowledge  and  technology  how  could  this
disaster  have  occurred?  Unfortunately  too  often  the  connection  between  scientific
understanding  and  practical,  applied  use  of  that  understanding  is  lacking  or  comes
too late.

The Administration’s proposed tsunami hazard reduction plan combines the capa-
bilities  of  two  agencies  to  help  address  the  tsunami  problem  of  the  future.  This  is
a good idea and will not only help protect U.S. coastal areas but help protect those
of neighboring countries as well. However, this technological solution is just a small
part of an effective real solution. There is a real danger that in our haste to fix what
was  broken  in  the  recent  disaster,  we  will  fix  the  wrong  thing  for  next  time.  Not
only  is  this  plan  embarrassingly  U.S.-centric,  it  doesn’t  clearly  address  the  whole
problem,  even  for  the  U.S.  Detecting  the  earthquake  and  generating  a  warning  is
one thing but distributing the warning to all at-risk populations who have been edu-
cated  about  what  to  do  is  the  bigger,  more  critical  mitigation  effort.  Indeed,  edu-
cation alone, even without a warning system, could save large parts of a coastal pop-
ulation.  Effective  information  could  be  as  simple  as,  ‘‘  If  you  feel  a  strong  earth-
quake and/or see the ocean level behave in an unusual way, get off the coast as fast,
far  and  high  as  possible.’’  This  plan  should  contain  a  much  stronger  educational
component.

There  are  other  dangers  of  the  quick  fix.  While  this  is  an  opportunity  to  signifi-
cantly  improve  mitigation  efforts  for  the  very  serious  yet  rare  tsunami  hazard  it  is
critical  that  the  enormity  of  the  recent  tragic  event  not  sidetrack  us  from  other
equally  dangerous  and  more  common  hazards.  Earthquakes  without  tsunamis  are
still  the  biggest  geologic  hazard  worldwide.  Unfortunately,  even  a  moderate  earth-
quake  directly  under  one  of  the  world’s  very  large  but  unprepared  cities  will  result
in many more deaths than resulted from the Indian Ocean tsunami. Improved haz-
ard mapping and building construction practices can make a huge difference in this
case.  Science  and  engineering  show  both  where  the  hazards  are  high  and  propose
techniques  to  significantly  mitigate  those  hazards.  U.S.  science  funding  has  made
great advances; however, putting the results into practical action is too often forgot-
ten.  As  one  example,  while  on  this  committee’s  recommendation  Congress  author-
ized the Advanced National Seismic System to take a lead role in improving earth-
quake  hazard  mitigation  Congress  has  only  appropriated  10  percent  of  the  needed
and  authorized  funding.  It  would  be  truly  unfortunate  if  in  our  rush  to  fix  the  tsu-
nami problem we forget about other, even more hazardous situations and wait until
after one of those occurs to make serious advances.
